Abstract: Background: The clinical course of Idiopathic Pulmonary 
Fibrosis (IPF) is unpredictable. Clinical prediction tools are not 
accurate enough to predict poor disease outcomes. 
Methods: All-comers with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis diagnosis were 
enrolled in this prospective, multicenter cohort study. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells or whole blood was collected at baseline from 425 
participants and during follow up from 66 patients. The Scoring Algorithm 
for Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS) was used to classify patients into low 
or high risk groups based on a 52-gene signature.  Mortality and 
transplant-free survival were studied using Competing risk and Cox 
proportional-hazard models, respectively. Gene expression trends were 
analyzed using linear mixed-effect models.  The association between 
bidirectional changes in SAMS scores and transplant-free survival was 
obtained using a Cox proportional-hazards model. 
Findings:  The application of SAMS to the 52-gene signature identified 
two groups of IPF patients (low and high risk) with significant 
differences in mortality or transplant-free survival in all cohorts (HR 
2·03-4·37).  Pooled data revealed similar results for mortality (HR 2·18, 
95%CI:1·53-3·09, P<0·001) or transplant-free survival (HR: 2·04, 95%CI: 
1·52-2·74, P<0·001). Adding SAMS scores to the GAP index significantly 
 improved its outcome predictive accuracy, particularly at 30 days (13% 
increase in Area Under the Curve for mortality prediction and 10.6% for 
transplant-free survival). Per patient temporal changes in SAMS were 
associated with changes in FVC (P<0·01). Bidirectional changes (≥10%) in 
SAMS scores were predictive of subsequent transplant-free survival.  
Interpretation:  Our results validate the use of a peripheral blood 52-
gene expression signature for outcome prediction in IPF

Introduction 
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive and highly lethal interstitial lung disease of 
unknown etiology. The median survival without transplant is approximately three to four years1. The 
natural history of the disease is highly variable and unpredictable with some patients demonstrating 
long term clinical stability and others experiencing a more rapid disease course2. While clinical 
parameters allow staging of patients, they do not predict outcome accurately3. In recent years, evidence 
emerged that blood molecular and genetic markers may be indicative of disease outcome and 
potentially improve the accuracy of clinical predictions4-9. However, the majority of these studies were 
limited in scope and replication.  
 We previously identified a 52 gene expression signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
(PBMC) that predicted transplant-free survival (TFS) in IPF and validated four of these genes (CD28, ICOS, 
LCK, ITK) by qRT-PCR6.  Here we demonstrate that a score based on the complete 52-gene expression 
signature accurately classifies IPF patients into two distinct risk profile groups and improves outcome 
prediction of clinical staging in six independent IPF cohorts. Temporal changes in this 52-gene signature 
score associate with changes in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). Substantial (≥10%) bidirectional changes 
accurately predict subsequent transplant-free survival.  
Methods 
The following sections summarize our methods. The online supplement includes more details: 
Design, settings and participants 
Study design is summarized in figure 1. Patients were recruited from the Universities of Yale 
(n=48), Imperial College London (n=55), Chicago (n=45), Pittsburgh (n=120), Freiburg (n=38) and 
Brigham and Women’s Hospital-Harvard Medical School (BWH-HMS) (n=119). IPF diagnosis was 
 4 
 
established by a multidisciplinary group at each institution following ATS/ERS guidelines10. Studies were 
approved by Institutional Review Boards at each institution and informed consent was obtained from all 
patients.  Demographic, clinical information, pulmonary function test and diffusion capacity of the lung 
for carbon monoxide (DLCO) were collected at the time of blood draw. The Gender, Age and Lung 
Physiology (GAP) index was calculated as reported by Ley and colleagues3. 
Sample collection, RNA extraction and quality assessment 
Yale, Chicago, Pittsburgh and Freiburg cohorts: PBMC collection, total RNA extraction and 
quality assessment methods have been previously described6. BWH-HMS and Imperial College Cohorts: 
Whole blood was collected using PAXgene blood RNA tubes (PreAnalytiX) and total RNA was extracted 
using the PAXgene Blood RNA Kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol.  
52-gene signature measurement 
Yale, Pittsburgh, Freiburg and BWH-HMS cohorts: The nCounter® analysis system (Nanostring)11 
was used to validate the 52-gene signature. Imperial College London cohort: Total RNA was labeled and 
hybridized to Affymetrix® Human Gene 1·1 ST Array Plates using the GeneTitan® instrument. University 
of Chicago cohort: The expression of the 52-gene signature was analyzed from a previously published 
gene expression dataset of PBMC from IPF patients6 (GEO accession number: GSE27957). Normalized, 
log2 transformed gene expression values were used for statistical analyses in all cohorts. 
Statistical methods and analysis  
Development of the Scoring Algorithm of Molecular Subphenotypes (SAMS): SAMS is a 
classification algorithm of gene expression data generated from the calculation of two scores (up and 
down scores).  The up and down scores are calculated using the product of two variables: the proportion 
of genes expected to be increased or decreased per patient and their normalized expression levels. The 
 5 
 
following steps summarize the calculation of SAMS scores: Step 1: the expression of each gene of the 
52-gene signature is normalized to the geometric mean of all the samples in the cohort. Step 2: the 
proportion of genes that are actually increased or decreased is calculated when compared to the 
number of increased or decreased genes of the gene signature. Step 3: Sum of the geometric mean 
normalized expression values (calculated in step 1) of increased and decreased genes. Step 4: 
Calculation of the product between the sum of normalized expression values of increased and decreased 
genes (calculated in step 3) and the proportion of genes expected to be increased or decreased 
(calculated in step 2). An example is provided in the online supplement. 
To determine risk profiles in each independent cohort, patients with up scores above the 
median value and down scores below the median value in each cohort were classified as “high risk”. 
Patients without this pattern of expression were classified as “low risk”. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) 
was used to identify significant differences in SAMS scores between cohorts. The SAMS calculator is 
publicly available at http://gem.med.yale.edu/SAMSWeb3/index.jsp 
Time to event analysis: Patients were followed from blood draw until death, loss of follow up, or 
transplant. Because two cohorts (Yale and Imperial college) did not contain transplants, we used 
different outcome definitions, transplant-free survival (TFS) in Chicago, Pittsburgh, Freiburg and BWH-
HMS and mortality in Yale and Imperial College. The association between genomic risk profiles and 
outcomes was determined by univariate Cox Proportional-Hazard models. For TFS, both transplants and 
deaths were considered events. To determine whether genomic risk profiles were predictive of the 
predetermined clinical outcomes, we pooled the data from all cohorts and adjusted for age, gender, 
percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%) and immunosuppressive therapy, defined as the use of 
prednisone, azathioprine, or a combination of both at the time of blood draw. Multivariate competing 
risk12 and Cox proportional-hazard13 models were applied to the pooled data to determine association 
 6 
 
with mortality or TFS respectively. For mortality analyses in the pooled data, transplants were 
considered a competing risk (Figure 1a).  Differences in mortality and TFS between patients with high 
and low risk genomic profiles were evaluated using cumulative incidence and Kaplan Meier curves, 
respectively. To test whether genomic risk profile information from the 52-gene signature could improve 
outcome prediction when used in combination with the GAP index3, we fit competing risk12 and Cox 
proportional-hazard13 models as follows: GAP only, genomic only, GAP and genomic or the G-GAP index. 
The G-GAP index was calculated by adding three points (the maximum score in the GAP index) to the 
GAP index if a patient had a high risk genomic profile and no points if they had a low risk profile. To 
determine the prediction accuracy of these models and to compare their predictive performance, we 
used time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) for censored data14 and Area Under the 
Curve (AUC). Pooled data analysis results were adjusted to patient’s age, gender, immunosuppression 
use and percent predicted forced vital capacity (FVC%). 
 
Time course analysis: Time course analyses were performed in the Pittsburgh cohort (Figures 1b 
and Figure S1). Trends in SAMS scores and forced vital capacity volumes (FVC) were plotted to identify 
shifts in genomic risk profiles over time. To identify statistically significant differences in up and down 
scores, and FVC across time between high and low risk patients, we used a linear mixed-effect (LME) 
model15 with random intercepts. A linear mixed-effect model with random intercepts was also used to 
study the associations between relative changes in up and down scores and relative changes in FVC in 
patients with simultaneous measurements. LME models were adjusted to patient’s age, gender and 
immunosuppression therapy. To determine the association between bidirectional changes in SAMS 
scores and survival, we calculated the relative changes in up and down scores for each IPF patient based 
on their first two visits, adjusting to the duration of time intervals. Thus, for each one of the Pittsburgh 
cohort patients with at least two visits (N=66), we calculated the relative changes in both scores per 
month, from one to six months (see supplementary methods). Patients were classified as high risk if 
 7 
 
relative changes in up and down scores between two subsequent visits occurred simultaneously and 
were ≥10%. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to determine the association between 
bidirectional changes in SAMS scores and TFS. Results were adjusted to patient’s age, gender, FVC and 
immunosuppressive therapy.  Statistical significance was defined as two-sided P<0·05. Analyses were 
performed using R. Details on the R packages are provided in the online supplement. 
Results  
Genomic risk profiles based on the 52-gene signature are predictive of outcome in IPF 
We measured the expression of a peripheral blood 52-gene signature6 in IPF patients followed 
at six independent academic centers (Table 1). Gene expression levels as well as clinical and 
demographic data were collected at baseline in all patients and across time in patients from the 
Pittsburgh cohort to perform time to event (Figure 1a) and time course analysis (Figure 1b), respectively. 
To classify patients as high or low risk we calculated up and down scores using SAMS. Up or down scores 
were not significantly different between cohorts suggesting a similar distribution of patients with high 
risk genomic profiles in each cohort (Figure S2). SAMS scores separated patients into high risk and low 
risk groups with impressive similarity in gene expression patterns within risk groups across the various 
cohorts (Figure 2a).  Univariate Cox Proportional-hazard models demonstrated that patients in the high 
risk group had significantly (P<0·05) higher mortality (Yale and Imperial College London cohort) or TFS 
(Chicago, Pittsburgh, Freiburg and BWH-HMS cohorts), respectively, when compared to patients with 
low risk genomic profiles (Figure 2b).  The hazard ratios (HR) for mortality and TFS ranged from 2·03 to 
4·37 indicating that patients with a high risk genomic profile had at least a two-fold increased risk of 
dying or having a lung transplant during follow-up in each independent cohort.  
The 52-gene signature is predictive of outcome independent of demographic and clinical variables  
 8 
 
To identify demographic and clinical characteristic differences between genomic risk profiles, a 
pooled data analysis was performed using data from all 425 IPF patients (Figure 3a). High risk patients 
were predominantly Caucasian males with lower FVC% and DLCO% at presentation. There were more 
high risk patients under immunosupressants (Supplementary Table 1). A high risk genomic profile was 
independently predictive of mortality (HR 2·18, 95% CI 1·53, 3·09, P<0·001) or TFS (HR 2·04, 95%CI 1·52, 
2·74, P<0·001) (Figure 3b,c) after adjusting for age, gender FVC% and immunosuppressive therapy in the 
pooled dataset.  A high risk genomic profile was also independently predictive of mortality (HR 2·27, 
95% CI 1·54, 3·35, P<0·001) or TFS (HR 2·13, 95%CI 1·54, 2·96 P<0·001) in this dataset, after excluding 
patients under immunosuppressants (Figure S3).  A prediction model based on the calculated G-GAP 
index outperformed all other prediction models studied (Supplementary Tables 2 and 3) and 
significantly improved mortality or TFS prediction (Figure 3d,e). The maximal Area Under the Curve 
changed by 13% (69% to 82%) or 10·6% (70% to 80·6%) for a 30-day mortality and TFS prediction, 
respectively. 
Changes in gene expression trends over time are associated with disease progression and subsequent 
IPF survival 
For time course analyses, we measured the expression of the 52-gene signature in RNA isolated 
from PBMC using the nCounter system, calculated up and down scores at each time point and collected 
FVC values over time in the Pittsburgh cohort (Figure 1b). The average number of visits in patients 
(N=66) with repeated gene expression measurements was 5·61 (Range: 2-18), the average follow-up 
time was 2·13 years (Range: 0·15-6·13) and the average length of time interval between visits was 0·46 
years (Range: 0·11-2·26).  
To determine whether high or low risk patients, shifted their genomic risk profile we compared 
up or down scores over time. The linear mixed-effects model demonstrated that differences in up and 
 9 
 
down scores between high and low risk groups remained significant over time (Figure 4a,b). The mean 
FVC value over time was significantly different between high and low risk groups (2·28 and 2·60 liters, 
respectively) (Figure 4c). An LME model demonstrated a significant association between relative 
changes in FVC and relative changes in up and down scores after adjusting for patient’s age, gender and 
immunosuppressive therapy. The association between relative changes in up scores versus relative 
changes in FVC was -0·048 (95%CI -0·079, -0·016 P=0·003) and relative changes in down score versus 
relative changes in FVC was -0·017 (95%CI -0·026, -0·007, P<0·001).  
We assessed whether substantial changes in SAMS scores over time were predictive of IPF 
survival. Since relative changes in FVC ≥10% have been associated with decreased IPF survival 16,17, we 
hypothesized that a relative increase in up score and a simultaneous decline in down score ≥10%, was 
also predictive of IPF survival. Univariate and multivariate Cox models (Supplementary Table 4) 
demonstrated that a simultaneous ≥10% increase in up score and decrease in down score, between two 
measurements obtained 30-days apart, was significantly predictive of future transplant-free survival 
(HR: 3·18· 95%CI 1·16, 8·76, P=0·025) (Figure 4e).  
Discussion 
We have previously identified a 52-gene signature predictive of TFS in two IPF patient cohorts by 
using microarray analysis of PBMC6. In this study, we sought to assess the survival prediction accuracy of 
the 52-gene signature in independent cohorts at baseline and prospectively by measuring the 
expression of these genes in peripheral blood from 425 IPF patients evaluated at six independent 
academic centers. By developing a new classification algorithm for gene expression data (SAMS), we 
were able to identify two novel genomic risk profiles of IPF patients based on the 52-gene signature with 
significant differences in mortality and TFS. Additionally, we demonstrated that adding genomic risk 
profile information to the GAP index (G-GAP index) significantly increased its prediction accuracy. We 
 10 
 
also demonstrated that bidirectional changes in SAMS scores ≥10%, between two measurements 
obtained 30-days apart, were predictive of subsequent transplant-free survival. 
The recognition of the variable clinical course in IPF led to a substantial effort to identify clinical 
tools and reliable peripheral blood biomarkers for risk stratification. Changes in peripheral blood 
proteins such as MMP7, ICAM and IL84, SP-A and SP-D5, KL-618, CCL-1819, YKL4020, CXCL1321, POSTN22, 
anti-hsp70 IgG antibodies23 and protease degradation products24, have been found to be predictive of 
poor IPF outcomes. Changes in circulating cells (CD4+CD28+ T cells6, fibrocytes25 and Semaphorin 7a+ 
regulatory T cells26), gene polymorphisms (TOLLIP27, TLR328 and MUC5B7) and aging biomarkers 
(Telomere length8) have also been associated with mortality in IPF. While these studies strongly 
suggested the value of peripheral blood biomarkers for risk stratification in IPF, no marker is currently 
used in clinical practice. This is, in part, because the majority of the studies did not have truly 
independent replication cohorts, nor did they demonstrate added value over clinical staging tools.  In 
contrast to previous studies, our study provides validation of our 52-gene expression signature in six 
independent IPF cohorts and demonstrates a substantial improved accuracy when incorporated with 
currently used clinical tools. This is important, because accurate outcome prediction has very practical 
implications for IPF patients. Based on the current lung allocation score, and on their clinical 
characteristics, nearly all of the patients in our study would be referred for transplant evaluation, and 
many would be eligible for lung transplantation. However, our data suggests that only patients with a 
high risk genomic profile could require this evaluation urgently, and many may not require lung 
transplantation even three to five years after diagnosis. Thus, incorporating the 52-gene signature score 
based on SAMS in the evaluations of IPF patients, may enhance the precision of lung transplantation 
referral – avoiding delays in transplants to those who need it early, and delaying those who may not 
need it. Similarly, when lung transplantation is not an option, this test could also help physicians 
deciding when to refer IPF patients to palliative care, a currently significant unmet need29.  Another 
 11 
 
unique attribute of our study compared to previous studies, is the temporal analysis. We demonstrate 
that a patient’s 52-gene signature risk score rarely changes in low risk patients and patients do not shift 
their risk profile from high to low or vice versa. This is important, if indeed patients do not 
spontaneously shift their risk profile, such a shift could be very meaningful. As an example, a shift in the 
risk profile from high to low risk could indicate response to drug therapy and bidirectional changes in 
scores could indicate impending deterioration.  
While our study focuses on the biomarker applications of the 52-gene signature for risk 
stratification in IPF, it could also serve to generate hypotheses for follow up studies. We have previously 
shown that four genes of this signature (CD28, ICOS, LCK and ITK), that belong to the T-cell co-
stimulatory signaling pathway, were correlated with the percentage of CD4+CD28+ T cells in the 
circulation of these patients6. Similarly, previous reports have demonstrated that changes in circulating 
CD4+ T cells with CD28 down-regulation30 of IPF patients are also associated with poor disease 
outcomes. These reports suggest a potential link between changes in the expression of genes in the 52-
gene signature with phenotypic shifts in circulating immune cells. Similarly, a recent report suggested 
that down-regulation of T cell co-stimulation markers is associated with T cell exhaustion and poor 
outcomes in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases31. While IPF is not generally considered an 
autoimmune disease, T cell exhaustion is a mechanism that should be explored as a potential 
explanation of our findings. Additionally, other members of the 52-gene expression signature may have 
also some clues about the role of immune aberrations in IPF. As an example, MCEMP1 (mast cell-
expressed membrane protein 1) one of the outcome predictive genes when overexpressed, encodes a 
transmembrane protein which has been isolated from human mast cells32, known to work in concert 
with fibroblasts to aggravate pulmonary fibrosis33 or FLT3 (Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3) a strong 
Nintedanib-responsive tyrosine kinase with unknown roles in pulmonary fibrosis. While such studies 
were beyond the scope of this paper, they could potentially shed light on the role of immune 
 12 
 
aberrations in IPF, especially in consideration of the recent reports of the importance of microbiome 
changes in IPF34,35.   
Despite the impressive reproducibility of our findings, we need to recognize some of the 
limitations our study. First, our study is limited by lack of assessment of the 52-gene signature in 
response to drug therapy. Our patients were recruited before Pirfenidone36 and Nintedanib37 were 
approved by the FDA, thus, we could not assess their effect on the 52-gene signature. In addition, we 
did not determine whether the 52-gene signature is specific to IPF.  To assess the effect of aging, we 
analyzed the 52-gene signature in control individuals older than 90 years of age38,39 (Figure S4), and 
found that it was not predictive of mortality, but we did not study other chronic lung disease. Finally, 
our analysis demonstrating the association between ≥10% bidirectional changes in SAMS scores based 
on the 52-gene signature and IPF survival, was only performed in a subset of patients from one of the 
cohorts studied and will require additional validation in other cohorts.  
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that a 52-gene signature in peripheral blood is able to 
distinguish two genomic risk profiles with significant differences in mortality and TFS. The enhanced 
outcome prediction when combining high risk genomic profiles with the GAP index (G-GAP index) and 
the association of gene expression changes over time with FVC, and survival, indicates that a blood test 
using the 52-gene signature should be further developed and studied in clinical practice for risk 
stratification and disease monitoring in IPF.

Figure 1. Study design. The outline summarizes the (a) time to event and (b) time course analysis design 
for this study including the cohorts, blood compartments, experiments and statistical methods used in 
each independent cohort and in the pooled data analysis. PBMC: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

Figure 2. Genomic risk profiles based on the 52-gene signature are predictive of outcome in IPF. (a) 
Clustering of IPF patients based on genomic risk profiles (high vs low) derived from the 52-gene 
signature using SAMS in each one of the six cohorts studied.  Every row represents a gene and every 
column a patient.  Color scale is shown adjacent to heat maps in log-based two scale; yellow denotes 
increase over the geometric mean of samples and purple, decrease.  (b) Mortality and Transplant-free 
survival (TFS) differs between high vs low risk profiles based on the 52-gene signature in each 
independent cohort.  
 
 
Figure 3.  The 52-gene signature is predictive of outcome independent of demographic and clinical 
variables. (a) Pooled data analysis comparing high vs low risk profile patients from all cohorts. Color 
scale is shown adjacent to heat maps in log-based two scale. (b) Mortality and (c) Transplant-free 
survival (TFS) differs between high vs low risk patients from all cohorts after adjusting for age, gender, 
FVC% and immunosuppressive therapy. (d) Area Under the Curve (AUC) of time-dependent ROC analysis 
for (d) mortality and (e)TFS based on the GAP index alone or the G-GAP index in all patients.  
 
Figure 4. 52-gene signature trends over time demonstrate association with disease progression and 
survival (a) up and down (b) scores from SAMS, and (c) FVC volumes are significantly different over time 
in high (continuous red line) vs low (continuous black line) risk groups. Pointwise confidence intervals 
are represented in purple. (d) Bidirectional changes in SAMS scores (increase in up score and 
simultaneous decline in down score) can be observed during disease course in IPF and are more 
prominent in high risk individuals (example shown in dotted black line box). (e) Bidirectional changes in 
SAMS scores are predictive of Transplant-free survival (TFS). Dotted blue line (high risk) – Pittsburgh 
cohort patients with 30-day bidirectional changes in SAMS scores ≥10%. Continuous red line (low risk) – 
Pittsburgh cohort patients with 30-day bidirectional changes in SAMS scores <10%. Results adjusted to 
age, gender, FVC and immunosuppressive therapy.
