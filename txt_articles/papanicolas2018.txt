 Health Care Spending in the United States
and Other High-Income Countries
Irene Papanicolas, PhD; Liana R. Woskie, MSc; Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH
IMPORTANCE Health care spending in the United States is a major concern and is higher than
in other high-income countries, but there is little evidence that efforts to reform US health
care delivery have had a meaningful influence on controlling health care spending and costs.
OBJECTIVE To compare potential drivers of spending, such as structural capacity and
utilization, in the United States with those of 10 of the highest-income countries (United
Kingdom, Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland,
and Denmark) to gain insight into what the United States can learn from these nations.
EVIDENCE Analysis of data primarily from 2013-2016 from key international organizations
including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), comparing
underlying differences in structural features, types of health care and social spending, and
performance between the United States and 10 high-income countries. When data were not
available for a given country or more accurate country-level estimates were available from
sources other than the OECD, country-specific data sources were used.
FINDINGS In 2016, the US spent 17.8% of its gross domestic product on health care, and
spending in the other countries ranged from 9.6% (Australia) to 12.4% (Switzerland). The
proportion of the population with health insurance was 90% in the US, lower than the other
countries (range, 99%-100%), and the US had the highest proportion of private health
insurance (55.3%). For some determinants of health such as smoking, the US ranked second
lowest of the countries (11.4% of the US population �15 years smokes daily; mean of all 11
countries, 16.6%), but the US had the highest percentage of adults who were overweight or
obese at 70.1% (range for other countries, 23.8%-63.4%; mean of all 11 countries, 55.6%).
Life expectancy in the US was the lowest of the 11 countries at 78.8 years (range for other
countries, 80.7-83.9 years; mean of all 11 countries, 81.7 years), and infant mortality was the
highest (5.8 deaths per 1000 live births in the US; 3.6 per 1000 for all 11 countries). The US
did not differ substantially from the other countries in physician workforce (2.6 physicians per
1000; 43% primary care physicians), or nursing workforce (11.1 nurses per 1000). The US had
comparable numbers of hospital beds (2.8 per 1000) but higher utilization of magnetic
resonance imaging (118 per 1000) and computed tomography (245 per 1000) vs other
countries. The US had similar rates of utilization (US discharges per 100 000 were 192 for
acute myocardial infarction, 365 for pneumonia, 230 for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease; procedures per 100 000 were 204 for hip replacement, 226 for knee replacement,
and 79 for coronary artery bypass graft surgery). Administrative costs of care (activities
relating to planning, regulating, and managing health systems and services) accounted for 8%
in the US vs a range of 1% to 3% in the other countries. For pharmaceutical costs, spending
per capita was $1443 in the US vs a range of $466 to $939 in other countries. Salaries of
physicians and nurses were higher in the US; for example, generalist physicians salaries were
$218 173 in the US compared with a range of $86 607 to $154 126 in the other countries.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The United States spent approximately twice as much as
other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the United States were
largely similar to those in other nations. Prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals,
and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost
between the United States and other high-income countries. As patients, physicians, policy
makers, and legislators actively debate the future of the US health system, data such as these
are needed to inform policy decisions.

 T
he United States spends more per capita on health care
than any other nation, substantially outpacing even other
very high-income countries.1,2 However, despite its
higher spending, the United States performs poorly in areas such
as health care coverage and health outcomes.3-5 Higher spending
without commensurate improved health outcomes at the popula-
tion level has been a strong impetus for health care reform in the
United States.6
Although it is well known that the United States spends
more on health care than other countries, less is known about
what explains these differences. The consensus has been that
the US fee-for-service system is a primary factor,7 leading to
fragmentation, overuse, and
an underinvestment in social
determinants of health,8-10
driving high utilization of
health care services and poor
outcomes. Older studies have
found that the United States
may underinvest in social
services,11 although other data
suggest that higher prices
in the United States, especially
for pharmaceuticals, may be
a contributor to spending dif-
ferences.12,13 One study sug-
gested that increasing rates of outpatient spending and remu-
neration of clinicians is a major contributor to the cost difference
between the United States and other countries.14 Given that
other high-income countries are able to spend less and achieve
better health outcomes, a more nuanced, data-driven under-
standing of all aspects of health care cost are needed to assist in
reform of the US health care system.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment (OECD) and the Commonwealth Fund have recently col-
lected and made available increasingly comparable data on inputs
and performance of the health care systems across high-income
countries. Using these and related data, we compared perfor-
mance of the United States with 10 other high-income countries on
key metrics that underpin health care spending. By examining
granular data, we sought to understand why US health care costs
are so much higher and where policy makers might target their
efforts to encourage a more efficient system.
Methods
Selection of Comparison Countries
Ten high-income countries were selected for comparison. These
countries were chosen because they were among the highest-
income countries in the world, had relatively high health care
spending, and had populations with similar demographic character-
istics that have similar burdens of illness.3,15 Based on these criteria,
the United Kingdom (consisting of England, Scotland, Wales, and
Northern Ireland), Canada, Germany, Australia, Japan, Sweden,
France, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland were chosen
for comparison. These 10 selected countries represent different
geographic areas and diverse health system structures.
Conceptual Framework and Indicator Selection
To better understand the higher US health care costs relative to
other high-income countries, a range of outcomes were explored.
We first analyzed comparative data on general health system
spending, including spending by function. Next, comparative
inputs, including labor costs and structural capacity (which,
aside from contributing to direct costs, may also influence mainte-
nance costs or influence the price to use equipment) were ex-
amined. Because many of the leading explanations relating to
higher health care costs involve the transformation of health care
dollars to health care outcomes,16 we extended the analysis to
examine a range of intermediate outputs—namely, access, utiliza-
tion (inpatient, outpatient, major procedures), pharmaceutical
spending and utilization, patient experience, and quality of care—as
well as valued health system outcomes, such as population health.
To provide a broader context of overall factors that can contribute
to differences in health care spending, we also examined social
spending, as well as demographic differences, risk factors, and
prevalence of disease. In line with previous international compari-
sons, the health care system included all groups whose primary
intent is to improve health.5,17
This approach resulted in the presentation of a total of 98 indi-
cators across 7 domains: (1) general spending; (2) population
health; (3) structural capacity; (4) utilization; (5) pharmaceuticals;
(6) access and quality; and (7) equity. In each domain, measures
were selected that were available across the majority of the coun-
tries in the analysis. We were unable to find comparable pricing
data for most areas, such as for diagnostic procedures and treat-
ments, except for workforce remuneration and pharmaceuticals.
In the area of quality, the focus was on indicators that captured
quality of prevention, primary care, and inpatient care across the
areas of appropriateness, effectiveness, experience, and safety. In
the area of access to care, variations related to financial costs as
well as waiting times were explored. In addition, reflecting equity,
variations related to service availability, quality of care, and cost
were assessed.
Data Sources
Data were extracted from a range of databases compiled by inter-
national organizations, with the majority coming from the OECD.

High-Income Countries
Key Points
Question Why is health care spending in the United States so
much greater than in other high-income countries?
Findings In 2016, the United States spent nearly twice as much as
10 high-income countries on medical care and performed less well
on many population health outcomes. Contrary to some
explanations for high spending, social spending and health care
utilization in the United States did not differ substantially from
other high-income nations. Prices of labor and goods, including
pharmaceuticals and devices, and administrative costs appeared
to be the main drivers of the differences in spending.
Meaning Efforts targeting utilization alone are unlikely to reduce
the growth in health care spending in the United States; a more
concerted effort to reduce prices and administrative costs
is likely needed.

 Data on structural equipment, workforce, utilization, pharmaceuti-
cal spending, access, and quality were accessed from OECD.stat
and the OECD 2015 Health Care at a Glance report. Additional
data on health spending, health system, and country characteris-
tics were obtained from the World Bank International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development–International Development
Association database and the 2016 OECD Health Systems Charac-
teristics Survey.
Data on retail pharmaceutical spending per capita were
obtained from the OECD for all countries. Data on total pharmaceu-
tical spending per capita were obtained from Intercontinental
Marketing Services or the International Federation of Pharmaceuti-
cal Manufacturers and Associations. Pharmaceutical data on
country-level output of new chemical entities was taken from
Daemmrich.18 Population perceptions of the health system and
select access measures were obtained from the 2016 Common-
wealth Fund Survey of Consumers.15
All data on per capita spending, gross domestic product (GDP),
and remuneration were translated into US dollar equivalents, with
exchange rates based on purchasing power parities of national cur-
rencies. Remuneration data were then converted to 2017 dollars
using the US Consumer Price Index in line with Laugesen and
Glied.19 Data on health spending are presented by function of care
as a percentage of the country’
s total spending on health consis-
tent with System of Health Accounts categorization, with adapta-
tions for outpatient spending to address issues of comparability
with the United States’National Health Expenditure Accounts
(eTable 2 in Supplement 1). When OECD data were not available
for a given country or more accurate country-level estimates were
available, country-specific data sources were used. The focus was
on indicators from 2013 onward with an occasional exception. For
example, for the United States, data for the horizontal index, neo-
natal mortality by low birth weight, and antibiotic prescribing were
from 2009, 2004, and 2004, respectively.

Results
Demographic Characteristics and Health Care Spending
In 2016, the US population was significantly larger than all
comparison countries at 323 million (Figure 1 and eTable 1 in
Supplement 2). Japan had the next largest population with 127 mil-
lion. The US system also covered the second largest geographical
area (9 834 000 sq km), following Canada (9 985 000 sq km). The
other countries other than Australia had much smaller land mass.
In 2016, the United States spent 17.8% of its GDP on health care
(range of the other countries, 9.6%-12.4%; mean of all 11 countries,
11.5%) (Figure 1 and Figure 2) and had almost double the health
spending per capita (mean, $9403) compared with the other coun-
tries (range, $3377-$6808; mean of all 11 countries, $5419).
Although the United States spent more, the percentage of the
population with health insurance in the United States was 90%,
lower than in all of the other countries (range, 99%-100%).
All systems had relatively similar levels of public spending as a
percentage of GDP (defined as spending from government and/or
socialorcompulsoryinsurancefunds),withtheUnitedStatesspend-
ingataboutthemeanlevel(8.3%)ofallthecountries,although,un-
like the other countries, this spending covered only about 37% of
the population. By expenditure as a function of care, the United
Statesspentonly19%ofitshealthspendingoninpatientcare,which
excludessame-dayhospitalcare.Thisproportionwaslessthanthat

paredwithameanof31%)andgovernanceandadministration,which
includes activities relating to planning, regulating, and managing
health systems and services (8% compared with a mean of 3%).
Across the 11 countries, the United States had the lowest per-
centageofthepopulationolderthan65years(14.5%comparedwith
ameanof18.2%)andalsohadthehighestrateofpoverty,with24%
of the population living below the poverty line, followed by Japan
(22%)andCanada(21%).TheUnitedStatesrankedbelowthemean
but was not an outlier with regard to total social spending (spend-
ingonoldage,incapacity,labormarket,education,family,andhous-
ing [Figure 3]) at 16.7% of GDP (compared with a mean of 19.4% of
GDP in all 11 countries). This reflected public social spending, which
was, at 11.3% of GDP, below the mean of all 11 countries (15.3% of
GDP). The United States ranked fourth with regard to private social
spending at 5.4% of GDP (compared with a mean of 4.1%) and was
similar to the United Kingdom (5.6%) and ranked behind
the Netherlands (7.1%) and Switzerland (6.0%), reflecting mostly
private pension payments.20
Insurance System Characteristics
The structural characteristics of the health care system are de-
tailed in the Table. Three countries, the United Kingdom, Sweden,
and Denmark, have national health care systems, whereas
Canada and Australia have regionally administered universal insur-
ance programs. Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland
have statutory/mandatory health insurance systems. Only the
United States has a voluntary, private employer-based and
individual-based system. All of the countries except the United
States have an automatic or compulsory enrollment process.
Private insurance as the primary form of insurance is highest in the
United States at 55.3%, followed by Germany at 10.8%. The major-
ity of the countries do not have private insurance as the primary
form of insurance.
Population Health
Amongimportantdeterminantsofhealth,theUnitedStateshadthe
highest percentage of overweight or obese adults (70.1% com-
pared with a mean of 55.6%) but had relatively low smoking rates
(11.4%ofthepopulationcomparedwithameanof16.6%)(Figure4
and eTable 2 in Supplement 2). The drinking rate (8.8 L per capita)
and unemployment rate (4.4%) in the United States are both
close to the mean values of all 11 countries at 9.1 L per capita and
5.4%, respectively.

 The United States consistently had the poorest population
health outcomes (Figure 4). The United States had the lowest life
expectancy (78.8 years compared with a mean of 81.7 years) and
the lowest health-adjusted life expectancy (69.1 years compared
with a mean of 72.0 years). The variability of life expectancy across
the United States (ranging from 81.3 years in Hawaii to 75 years in
Mississippi) (eTable 3 in Supplement 1) was similar to that of the life
expectancy across all countries in the study.
The United States had the highest infant mortality (5.8 deaths
per 1000 live births compared with a mean of 3.6), neonatal mor-
tality(4.0deathsper1000livebirthscomparedwithameanof2.6),
and maternal mortality (26.4 deaths per 100 000 live births com-
paredwithameanof8.4)(Figure4).TheUnitedStatesalsohadthe
second highest percentage of infants with low birth weight (8.1%
compared with a mean of 6.6%). Japan had the highest low birth
weight(9.5%).Whenadjustingneonatalmortalitytoexcludedeaths
ofinfantsbornweighinglessthan1000g,theUnitedStatesranked
fifth relative to the other countries, with 1.61 deaths per 1000 live
births, compared with a mean of 1.70 for all 11 countries.
Workforce and Structural Capacity
The physician workforce in the United States was lower than the
mean of all 11 countries at 2.6 per 1000 population compared with
3.3 per 1000 population (Figure 5 and eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
The proportion of US physicians who were primary care physicians
(43%) was the same as the mean of all 11 countries. Using a func-
tionality-based approach to identifying primary care physicians,
USgeneralinternistsprovidedasignificantamountofprimarycare,
whereas internists in Canada almost exclusively provided acute
hospital-based care (Figure 6). Compared with countries with
comparable data, mean remuneration of generalists, special-
ists, and nurses was higher in the United States. When adjusting
for purchasing power parity, the mean US remuneration for gener-
alists was $218 173, nearly double the mean remuneration in all 11
countries, which ranged from $86 607 in Sweden to $154 126 in
Germany.TheremunerationforspecialistswashigherintheUnited
States at $316 000 compared with other countries, ranging from
$98 452 in Sweden to $202 291 in Australia). The remuneration of
nurses was also higher in the United States ($74 160) than in other
countries,whereitrangedfrom$42 492inFranceto$65 082inthe
Netherlands.Theremunerationofhealthcareprofessionalsasara-
tio to the mean national wage was highest in the United States for
specialists (5.3 compared with a mean of 3.7), generalists (3.6 com-
pared with a mean of 2.7), and nurses (1.23 compared with
a mean of 1.1).
There was notable variation between countries in the supply of
medicalequipment,suchasmagneticresonanceimaging(MRI)units,
computed tomography (CT) machines, and mammography ma-
chines. Japan had the highest number of MRI units and CT scanners
perpopulation(approximately52and107per1millionpopulation,re-
spectively), and the United States had the second highest for MRI
(38 per 1 million population) and third highest for CT (41 per 1 million
population).ThelowestpercapitarateforbothMRIunitsandCTscan-
ners was in the United Kingdom, with 7.2 MRI units and 9.5 CT scan-
ners per 1 million population. The United States had fewer hospital
bedsper1000population(2.8)thanJapan(13.2)andGermany(8.2)
and fewer long-term beds per 1000 population older than 65 years
(38.8) compared with the mean of the study countries (54.2).
Utilization
The United States’utilization of health care services was similar
to the other countries (Figure 7 and eTable 4 in Supplement 2),

Social spending is the provision by public (and private) institutions of benefits to
and financial contributions targeted at households and individuals to provide
support during circumstances that adversely affect their welfare, provided that
the provision of the benefits and financial contributions constitutes neither a
direct payment for a particular good or service nor an individual contract or
transfer. Such benefits can be cash transfers or can be direct (in-kind) provision
of goods and services. Main spending areas include old age, health, family,
incapacity, labor market, and housing (Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development). Private social spending is functionally the same as public
social spending but provided through a private mechanism. Social benefits
delivered through the private sector (not transfers between individuals) involve
an element of compulsion and/or interpersonal redistribution; for example,
through pooling of contributions and risk sharing. This may include old-age
pensions and support services for older adults, survivor benefits, disability and
sickness cash benefits, family support, unemployment benefits, housing
support (eg, rent subsidies), and other social policy areas excluding health
spending. Pensions constitute an important part of private social spending in
the United States and can be mandatory or voluntary. Independent,
out-of-pocket spending on social services is not included.

c United States: compulsory from 2014 to 2017.
dUnited States: an establishment is defined as a single physical location where business is conducted or where
services or industrial operations are performed.
e Duplicate: private insurance that offers coverage for health services already included under public health
insurance. Duplicate health insurance can be marketed as an option to the public sector because,
while it offers access to the same medical services as the public scheme, it also offers access to different
providers or levels of service, such as (1) access to private health facilities that are not accessible through public
insurance when the full cost of the service is paid by private insurance; (2) access to fast/privileged coverage by
bypassing queues in public system; (3) access to care independent of referral and gatekeeper systems;
(4) choice of physician, hospital, or other health care provider. It does not exempt individuals from contributing
to public health insurance. Supplementary: private health insurance that provides coverage for additional health
services not covered by the public scheme. Depending on the country, it may include services that are
uncovered by the public system such as luxury care, elective care, long-term care, dental care, pharmaceuticals,
rehabilitation, alternative or complementary medicine, etc, or superior hotel and amenity hospital services
(even when other portions of the service, such as the medical component, are covered by the public system).
Complimentary: private insurance that complements coverage of publicly insured services or services within
principal/substitute health insurance, which is intended to pay only a proportion of qualifying care costs,
by covering all or part of the residual costs not otherwise reimbursed (eg, co-payments). May be referred to
as “supplementary” in US literature.

lower rates vs the other 10 countries, such as for hip replacements
(204 per 100 000 population compared with a mean in all 11 coun-
tries of 207 per 100 000 population).
Length of stay had less variation across countries with the ex-
ception of Japan, which had a mean all-cause length of stay of 16.9
days, far longer than in the other countries (Figure 8). The United
States had relatively fewer days in the hospital compared with the

dial infarction hospitalization) (Figure 7).

quality data to government or other agencies is a major problem,”
and 16% reported having spent “a lot of time on paperwork or dis-
putes related to medical bills.”
Pharmaceuticals
Among the 11 countries, the United States had the highest pharma-
ceutical spending per capita at $1443, with Switzerland following at
$939 and a mean of $749 for all 11 countries (Figure 9 and eTable 5
in Supplement 2). Retail spending per capita was also highest in the
United States at $1026, representing about 71% of the total, which
was consistent with the group mean at 72% (Figure 9). For 4 phar-
maceuticals (Crestor, Lantus, Advair, and Humira) used for com-
mon conditions, the United States had higher prices than all other
countries; for 3 of these, the US price was more than double the
next highest price. With respect to a measure of innovation, the
United States and Switzerland had the highest number of new
chemical entities at 111 and 26, respectively. The United States
accounted for 57% of total global production of new chemical enti-
ties. No estimates were available for Canada, Australia, Sweden,
the Netherlands, and Denmark. The United States also had high
generic penetration at 84% of the total pharmaceutical market,
which was comparable with markets in the United Kingdom and
Germany. Australia and the Netherlands had low generic penetra-
tion at 30% and 17%, respectively. Despite having the highest rate
of generic penetration, the amount that the United States spent
on generic products as a percentage of total pharmaceutical spend-
ing was similar to other countries, suggesting that brand-name

See eTable 3 in Supplement 2 for data ordered by country. Generalist physicians
are defined as any practicing physician registered in his or her country as
a generalist physician or a specialist in the field of family medicine, pediatrics,
geriatrics, or internal medicine and excludes students, interns, and
nonpracticing physicians. Remuneration numbers may be an underestimate in
some countries (eg, Canada) because they do not account for practice expenses
for self-employed physicians. Japan is excluded from remuneration means with
the exception of nursing. Definitions of specialist and generalist physicians
in regard to remuneration were taken from the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
a The number for Japan, 124 558, is a combined total of generalists and specialists.

 pharmaceuticals were largely responsible for high overall spending.
These countries have notably different ways in how they finance
pharmaceuticals; there is considerable variation in both the share
covered by private insurance and the percentage covered by pri-
vate out-of-pocket spending. The United States had high levels of
private spending (36% compared with a mean of 8%), although
similar to Canada (30%), and was below the mean for out-of-
pocket spending at 30% (compared with a mean of 36%). With
regard to antibiotic prescriptions, which are often considered a
measure of inappropriate treatment, the United States was above
the mean, with a defined daily dose (average maintenance dose
per day for a drug used for its main indication in adults) of 24 com-
pared with a mean of 20.2.
Access and Quality
Relative to comparison countries, US performance varied on qual-
ity and access measures (Figure 10 and eTable 6 in Supplement 2).
Oftheothercountriesexamined,theUnitedStateswastheonlyone
in which a sizeable minority (approximately 10%) of individuals
lacked coverage for basic health care services (Figure 1). For the 3
access measures (ability to get same- or next-day care when sick,

ornext-daycarecomparedwithameanof57%inall11countries.In
the United States, 6% had a wait time of 2 months or more to see a
specialist compared with mean of 13% in all 11 countries. Waiting
times to see a specialist were longer for national health service
and single-payer systems (ie, percentage with wait times longer
than2months:Canada,39%;UnitedKingdom,19%;Sweden,19%)
compared with insurance-based systems (Netherlands, 7%;
Switzerland, 9%; Germany, 3%; France, 4%), with a mean of 13%.
TheUnitedStatesrankednearthemeanforpatientsreportinghav-

lower rates of measles immunization (92% compared with a mean
of94%)(Figure10).TheUnitedStateshadconsiderablylowerrates
of all 4 clinical outcome measures than the other countries. Thirty-
day mortality for ischemic stroke was 4.2 per 100 patients in the

countries.Forobstetrictraumawithoutinstrument,theUnitedStates

US Disaggregated Data
When access and quality measures were disaggregated by payer,
the United States performed slightly worse for those covered by
Medicaid, but performance was uneven across insurance groups
(eTable 4 in Supplement 1). Nine percent of both privately insured
individuals and those insured by Medicaid reported a 2-month wait
time to see a specialist; this was lower than rates for Medicare
patients (11%) but higher than for uninsured individuals (8%). On
selected prevention measures, such as measles immunization, pri-
vately insured individuals had the highest rate of coverage at 95%,

The total number of physicians, or 100%, differs for each country. Data are 2017
or closest available year. A functionality-based definition to identify primary
care was used to identify physicians as those who provide a set of activities
whose functions define the boundaries of primary care. This included chronic,
preventive, and acute care in both inpatient and outpatient settings irrespective
of disease: disease prevention, early detection and diagnosis, treatment and
management, care coordination and integration, and health maintenance,
counseling, and/or patient education. The clinicians were often a patient’
s first
point of contact for the health system with some degree of longitudinal
responsibility for the patient. This definition was used to reach out to country
experts and identify who is considered a primary care clinician in each
respective country. National workforce data or Eurostat data, where available,
was then categorized according to expert responses. Physicians specializing in
obstetrics and gynecology are categorized as specialists for all countries but
have their own category in this figure.

 whereas for breast screening, Medicare beneficiaries had the high-
est rates (82%). Conversely, Medicare beneficiaries had the highest
rates of mortality for both ischemic stroke and acute myocardial
infarction. There was also variability in avoidable admissions:
patients with Medicaid insurance had the highest number of
asthma-related admissions and Medicare beneficiaries had the
highest number of admissions for diabetes. When disaggregated
by income or race, life expectancy was significantly different
among US groups, with nonwhite and poorer populations having
shorter life expectancies (eTables 3 and 4 in Supplement 1).
Equity
The United States had the highest horizontal inequity, indicating
themostinequitableaccesstophysicianswhenadjustedforneed.The
UnitedStateshadan11%rateofout-of-pocketspendingasapercent-
age of total national health spending (compared with a mean of
13% in all 11 countries) and a 2.6% rate as a percentage of house-
hold consumption (compared with a mean of 2.4%) (Figure 11 and
eTable 7 in Supplement 2). However, the United States had a higher
proportionofunmetneedinthepopulation,with22.3%ofthepopu-

system has free access at the point of entry, the United Kingdom re-
ported one of the lowest levels of barriers to accessing health ser-
vices, but the level was higher than in both Germany and Sweden.
Discussion
In this study based on data primarily from 2013-2016, the United
States spent approximately twice as much as other high-income
countries on medical care and fared worse on common population
healthoutcomessuchaslifeexpectancyandinfantmortality.How-
ever, the main findings of this comparison were that, contrary to
someexplanationsforhighspending,USsocialspendingandhealth
care utilization were relatively similar to other high-income na-
tions.Althoughutilizationofsomesurgicalprocedures(suchascoro-
naryangioplasty,totalkneereplacement,andcesareandelivery)was
higher in the United States, this utilization did not appear to ex-
plain a large part of the higher spending in the United States.

 The data also suggest that some of the more common explana-
tions about higher health care spending in the United States,
such as underinvestment in social programs, the low primary
care/specialist mix, the fee-for-service system encouraging high
volumes of care, or defensive medicine leading to overutilization,
did not appear to be major drivers of the substantially higher US
health care spending compared with other high-income countries.
Instead, the data suggest that the main driving factors were
likely related to prices, including prices of physician and hospital
services, pharmaceuticals, and diagnostic tests, which likely also
affected access to care. In addition, administrative costs appeared
much higher in the United States. These findings indicate that
efforts targeting utilization alone are unlikely to reduce the gap in
spending between the United States and other high-income coun-
tries, and a more concerted effort to reduce prices and administra-
tive costs is likely needed.
Several findings in this report may be surprising to policy mak-
ers. There is broad consensus among US policy makers that the
United States spends too much on health services and too little on
social services. This analysis showed that US social spending ap-
pearstobesimilartothatinotherhigh-incomeOECDcountries.This
finding calls into question the belief that higher health care spend-
ing is due to a lack of investment in social determinants. In particu-
lar, given that the United States did not appear to be an outlier with
regardtoutilizationofservices,itisunlikelythatalackofsocialspend-
ing results in higher health care spending due to a misallocation of
resources that results in greater need (and overutilization).
Another common perception among policy makers is that the
US system is often perceived to be disproportionately driven by
specialist care. However, the number of specialist practitioners in
the US system, both as an absolute number and a percentage, was
not considerably different from comparison countries. One expla-
nation may be differences in the way primary care services are
delivered in other countries. In many other countries, nurses and
allied health professionals may make up a higher proportion of the
health care workforce,21 although we did not find substantially
higher numbers of nurses in the other countries. The extent to
which this explains variation in numbers of physicians across sys-
tems is unclear, but it is unlikely to fully account for why the United
States is not an outlier.

 the salaries paid to both generalist and specialist physicians were
markedly higher in the United States, where specialists were paid
twice as much as those in the United Kingdom or Germany and pri-
mary care physicians and nurses also had substantially higher sala-
ries.However,itcanbedifficulttocomparesalariesofworkersfrom
various countries. In general, salaries for professionals are higher in
the United States than in other countries, and in addition, workers
intheUnitedStatesbearhighercostsinsomeareas,suchasforhealth
care insurance, higher education, or planning for retirement, than
workers in other countries. Some of these issues are accounted for
in the ratio of national average wage, but US physicians and nurses
still had the highest ratio.
Some of the differential observed in cost between physicians
and nurses in the United States and in the other countries may re-
flectdifferencesinproductivityortheextenttowhichtrainingcosts
are borne by the individual, although in either case it is unlikely to
account for the magnitude of the difference. In 2011, Laugesen and
Glied19 estimated that the investment repayment cost for private
educationintheUnitedStateswouldamounttoabout$21 300per
year for a primary care physician and about $24 400 for an ortho-
pedic surgeon over a 35-year period.
Takingthisinvestmentintoaccount,however,doesnotexplain
the more than $200 000 difference in compensation observed for
physiciansbetweencountries.Althoughremunerationvarieswidely
across systems, the optimal level of compensation remains unclear.
Salaries in the United States may be high, but recent debates on re-
muneration of medical staff in the United Kingdom and France, for
example, suggest that salaries in other countries may be too low.22
Other indicators, such as average wages for competitive nonhealth
professions or retention of medical graduates, may help inform ap-
propriate salaries of health care professionals in a given country.
Prices of services were not examined directly, but US health
care spending was found to be higher than in other countries
despite similar utilization patterns, suggesting that higher prices
were the primary cause of high health care spending in the United
States relative to other nations. This is consistent with prior work

c Volume is most often the proportion of total prescriptions that were for
generic brands. Volumes can be expressed in defined daily doses or as a
number of packages/boxes or standard units. Value is most often the
proportion of total cost (ie, government and patient expenditure) that was for
generic brands. Values can be, for instance, the turnover of pharmaceutical
companies, the amount paid for pharmaceuticals by third-party payers, or the
amount paid by all payers (third-party and consumers). Market value is most
often at ex-factory prices, while amounts paid by third-party payers and
consumers are in general at retail prices.
dDefined daily dose is the assumed mean maintenance dose per day for a drug
used for its main indication in adults. Data shown here are actual mean defined
daily doses for each country.

 by Anderson et al,23 which also illustrated higher health care
spending in the United States despite similar inputs and levels of
care utilization, and more recent work by Dieleman et al.13 In addi-
tion to differential prices for physician services and pharmaceuti-
cals, these results suggest that prices for nonphysician services and
procedures also appeared to be markedly higher in the United
States. For the select procedures for which comparable data were
available, the United States paid considerably more than its coun-
terparts. In 2013, the International Federation of Health Plans24
reported that the average cost in the United States was $75 345
for a coronary artery bypass graft surgery, whereas the costs
in the Netherlands and Switzerland were $15 742 and $36 509,
respectively. Computed tomography was also much higher in the
United States, with an average payment of $896 per scan com-
pared with $97 in Canada, $279 in the Netherlands, $432 in Swit-
zerland, and $500 in Australia in 2013. Similarly, the mean payment
for an MRI in the United States was $1145 compared with $350 in
Australia and $461 in the Netherlands.
Of particular interest to US health policy makers is the role of
the pharmaceutical market and its influence on health care spend-
ing. Not surprisingly, US spending on pharmaceuticals was almost
double the spending in comparison countries. Previous work sug-
gests that this is driven by high prices for brand-name drugs rather
than by utilization, which is comparable with other high-income
countries.24-27Acrosscomparisoncountries,theUnitedStateshad

theUnitedStates’totalspendingonpharmaceuticals.Australiaand
Francehadmuchsmallergenericmarketpenetrationrates,presum-
ably because brand-name drugs are comparatively affordable.25
Although the United States’high prices of pharmaceuticals are
controversial, these prices have been viewed as critical to innova-
tion,includingUSproductionofnewchemicalentities.18,28Whether
innovation justifies high levels of spending is not clear.
Performance on access is also a central concern to policy mak-
ers.ThesedataindicatedthattheUnitedStateshadthelowestrate
of insurance coverage. However, the percentage of the population
with health insurance is at a historical high and has continued to in-
crease since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. Out-of-pocket
spending was also surprisingly low in the United States, which may
beexplainedinpartbytherelativelyhighproportionofpatientswho
do not seek care or who skip consultations because of high costs.
Prior work has shown that out-of-pocket spending is more concen-
trated among the poor.29 Other factors influencing access to care
intheUnitedStatesasidefromaffordabilitylikelyincludethecoun-
try’
s considerable landmass (and correspondingly large rural popu-
lation).Personalchoiceisanadditionalalbeitcontentiousfactor.For
example, the Kaiser Family Foundation has found that approxi-
mately 20% of uninsured US residents have incomes of 400% or
more of the federal poverty level and have largely chosen to forgo
insurance.30 In the other countries in this study with similar health
insurance designs (the Netherlands and Switzerland), the propor-
tion of the population choosing to forego coverage is considerably
less.31,32Still,asubstantialproportionofpeoplewouldbenefitfrom
coverage but remain uninsured in the United States, and increas-
ing coverage for these individuals remains a policy priority.
A central concern in the United States is the extent to which
greater health care spending translates to better outcomes. Com-
paring intermediate country-level health care outcomes across a
range of health care services showed that the United States does
perform favorably on certain acute care outcomes but less so for
primary care measures. Notably, the United States had among the
highest breast cancer screening rates and the lowest 30-day mor-
tality rates for acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Although the
rates of avoidable hospitalizations in the United States, such as for
diabetes and asthma, are well above those of most of the countries
in the analysis, accounting for the United States’higher prevalence
of both diseases reduced this gap considerably. The United States
has relatively poor population health outcomes, which likely repre-
sents a combination of factors including issues with the affordabil-
ity of care. However, the United States average, in comparison
to averages of much smaller, more homogeneous countries, may
lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, the life expectancy of
Minnesota, a state comparable in size and demographics to

a The horizontal inequity index is the percentage probability of a physician visit
in the past 12 months by wealth. If the index is greater than 0, then
high-income groups access physicians more than low-income groups after
adjustment for relative need.
bRegarding unmet need, the Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy
Survey poses a number of questions to a representative sample from each
country. For this indicator, it was analyzed whether a respondent did not
consult with or visit a physician because of cost, skipped a medical test,
treatment, or follow-up that was recommended by a physician because of
cost, or did not fill or collect a prescription for medicine or skipped doses
of medicine because of cost. Low income is defined as household income
less than 50% of the country median.

 Sweden or Denmark, has more similar population health outcomes
to these countries than Minnesota has in comparison to Mississippi.
This analysis extends to a body of work that has explored US
healthcarespending33byrevisitingcomparisonsfollowingthepas-
sage of the Affordable Care Act, which has both increased cover-
age and spurred health care delivery reform toward the delivery of
high-valuecare.9,13SimilartopreviousworkbyGarberandSkinner,10
Reinhardtetal,12andAndersonetal23thatexaminedUShealthcare
spendingrelativetootherOECDcountries,wefoundthattheUnited
States spent significantly more on health care despite having simi-
larlevelsofutilization.However,from2010onwarditappearedthat
the United States had similar levels of public social spending com-
paredwithotherhigh-incomecountries.Whilepublicsocialspend-
ing has increased since 2010 (from 15.6% of GDP in 2005 to 19.3%
of GDP in 2010), utilization rates have remained relatively
unchanged.20,23 This finding suggests that differences in social
spendingarelesslikelytobethemaindriverofdifferencesinhealth

lar conclusion to recent work by Dieleman et al,13 which identified

carespendingoverthepast15yearsandnegativelyassociatedwith

Thisstudyhasseverallimitations.First,therewaslimitedavail-
ability of comparable data across health systems, which restricted
the areas of health system performance we were able to compare.
Inparticular,dataonpricesacrosssystemswerelacking,aswasthe
number of indicators on quality and coverage. The indicators se-
lected thus provide a snapshot of performance in some domains—
particularly quality—which may not be representative of quality of
the entire system or may be limited due to data availability across
all countries. For instance, 30-day mortality rates reflect only in-
hospital rates, which may influence the apparent variations ob-
served, particularly given differences in length of stay and dis-
chargepracticesacrosscountries.Second,becauseofthedifficulties
incollectingandstandardizingindicatorsacrosscountries,someof
thedatausedreflectdifferentyears,maybeoutofdate,ormayhave
beenmeasureddifferentlybasedoncountry-specificdefinitionsof
variables. Even when data were collected from the same source, is-
sues of comparability remain because of fundamental differences
in how systems are organized and, in turn, how care is categorized.
Twoareasofparticularconcernareoutpatientspendingandthepri-
mary care workforce. We attempted to address limitations in the
workforce data by utilizing a functionality-based approach to iden-
tifying who provides primary care services in each country and by
cross-referencingresultingnumberswithcountryexperts.Third,the
studywasabletopresentonlydescriptivecomparativefindings,and
itisnotpossibletomakeanycausalinferences.Fourth,thedatadid

tosomesurveysthatwerethebasisforsomemeasures,suchasabil-
itytogetsame-ornext-dayappointmentand2-monthwaittimeto
see a specialist physician, were not good across all countries. Sixth,
we did not consider the actual prices of devices, which, given the
increasing number of hip and knee replacements and use of other
devices, are emerging as an important consideration in the cost of
care in the United States.
Conclusions
The United States spent approximately twice as much as other
high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the
United States were largely similar to those in other nations. Prices
of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative
costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall
cost between the United States and other high-income countries.
As patients, physicians, policy makers, and legislators actively
debate the future of the US health system, data such as these are
needed to inform policy decisions.
