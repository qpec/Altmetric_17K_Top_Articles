Abstract
Background: We performed a systematic review of randomized controlled studies evaluating any drug, technique
or device aimed at improving the success rate or safety of tracheal intubation in the critically ill.
Methods: We searched PubMed, BioMed Central, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Clinical Trials and
references of retrieved articles. Finally, pertinent reviews were also scanned to detect further studies until May 2017.
The following inclusion criteria were considered: tracheal intubation in adult critically ill patients; randomized controlled
trial; study performed in Intensive Care Unit, Emergency Department or ordinary ward; and work published in the last
20 years. Exclusion criteria were pre-hospital or operating theatre settings and simulation-based studies. Two
investigators selected studies for the final analysis. Extracted data included first author, publication year,
characteristics of patients and clinical settings, intervention details, comparators and relevant outcomes. The
risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias tool.
Results: We identified 22 trials on use of a pre-procedure check-list (1 study), pre-oxygenation or apneic oxygenation
(6 studies), sedatives (3 studies), neuromuscular blocking agents (1 study), patient positioning (1 study), video
laryngoscopy (9 studies), and post-intubation lung recruitment (1 study). Pre-oxygenation with non-invasive
ventilation (NIV) and/or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) showed a possible beneficial role. Post-intubation recruitment
improved oxygenation, while ramped position increased the number of intubation attempts and thiopental had
negative hemodynamic effects. No effect was found for use of a checklist, apneic oxygenation (on oxygenation and
hemodynamics), videolaryngoscopy (on number and length of intubation attempts), sedatives and neuromuscular
blockers (on hemodynamics). Finally, videolaryngoscopy was associated with severe adverse effects in multiple trials.
Conclusions: The limited available evidence supports a beneficial role of pre-oxygenation with NIV and HFNC before
intubation of critically ill patients. Recruitment maneuvers may increase post-intubation oxygenation. Ramped position
increased the number of intubation attempts; thiopental had negative hemodynamic effects and videolaryngoscopy
might favor adverse events.

 Background
Critically ill patients frequently require tracheal intubation
in the intensive care unit (ICU), in the emergency depart-
ment (ED), or during in-hospital emergency in general
wards [1–3]. Critically ill patients differ from elective sur-
gical patients intubated in the operating theatre: often they
present with severe respiratory failure, hemodynamic in-
stability, increased sensitivity to the side effects of seda-
tives, recent food intake, and cardiac or cerebrovascular
diseases [2]. Airway management outside the operating
theatre has a high rate of major complications, such as se-
vere hypoxia, hemodynamic collapse, cardiac arrest, and
death [1, 3–6]. Moreover, the incidence of difficult intub-
ation is high when compared to elective intubation in the
operating room [1, 7, 8]. Lack of training, supervision and
assistance, failure to identify patients at risk, failure to plan
and carry out a backup strategy if required, and deficiency
in available equipment, all are the most relevant modifi-
able risk factors [6]. Other factors that could increase the
incidence
of
adverse
events
include
the
emergent
requirement of tracheal intubation preventing adequate
preparation, and the commonly limited physical space
around ICU beds. Accordingly, interventions to improve
everyday practice, in particular pre-oxygenation and first-
attempt success rate, have been proposed and evaluated
individually or as combined in bundles [2, 3, 9]. However,
these protocols are based mostly on expert opinions, low-
quality retrospective or before-after studies, or are derived
from guidelines developed for elective intubation in the
operating theatre. So far, there has not been a systematic
review focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
We performed a systematic review of RCTs evaluating
any drug, technique, or device aimed at improving the
success rate or the safety of tracheal intubation in critic-
ally ill patients performed in ICU, ED or general ward
settings. When feasible, we also performed a meta-
analytic assessment of these findings.
Methods
Search strategy
PubMed, BioMed Central, Embase and the Cochrane
Central Register of Clinical Trials were searched for per-
tinent studies (updated 13 November 2017) by five in-
vestigators (LC, MB, OS, CV, and CDSS). The full
PubMed/Medline
search
strategy
is
reported
in
Additional file 1: Figure S1. The references of retrieved
articles were checked for further studies. Moreover, the
investigators scanned pertinent reviews to detect further
studies. No language restriction was enforced.
Study selection
References obtained from databases and the literature
were first independently examined at title/abstract level
by six investigators (LC, MB, OS, CV, AP, and CDSS),
with disagreement resolved by consensus under supervi-
sion of two investigators (GL and AZ) and, if potentially
pertinent, full articles were retrieved.
The following inclusion criteria were employed for
potentially relevant studies: (a) tracheal intubation in
critically ill patients; (b) RCT; (c) study performed in
adult patients in the ICU, ED or general ward; and (d)
study published in the last 20 years in a peer-reviewed
journal.
Exclusion criteria included pre-hospital or operating
theatre settings and studies based on simulation. Two
investigators (LC and GL) selected studies for the final
analysis, independently assessing compliance with the
selection
criteria.
Divergences
were
resolved
by
consensus.
Data abstraction and study characteristics
Standardized forms were used to extract data with dis-
agreements resolved by discussion or involving a third
reviewer when required. Data, which were extracted fol-
lowing the patient, population or problem, intervention,
comparison, outcomes (PICO) approach, included first
author, publication year, characteristics of patients and
clinical settings (the population), intervention details,
comparators, relevant outcomes (e.g. indicators of effi-
cacy or safety), and risk of bias. To assess the risk of
bias, we used the Cochrane Collaboration’s Risk of Bias
tool.
Statistical analysis
We pooled estimates of treatment effects for each out-
come by random-effects model meta-analysis using the
inverse variance for binary data and Mantel-Haenszel
methods for continuous data. We used the random-
effects model because we anticipated that studies would
include patients from varied populations, and investiga-
tors with different experience for intubation, thereby
resulting in the estimation of heterogeneous intervention
effects. We report continuous outcomes as mean differ-
ence and dichotomous outcomes as risk ratios (RRs)
with their 95% confidence interval (CI). When continu-
ous variables were analyzed as median and interquartile
range or CI we transformed the data using the following
formula: mean = median; with interquartile range stand-
ard deviation = (3rd quartile - 1st quartile)/1.35; with CI
standard deviation = √sample size x (upper limit – lower
limit)/3.92, to avoid losing data. We assessed heterogen-
eity using the I2 statistic. We also assessed the p value
for the I2 statistic to determine the strength of evidence
for heterogeneity. In accordance with Cochrane guid-
ance, we did not analyze publication bias because our
search identified fewer than ten studies for each data
comparison. We compared treatment effects across

 subgroups using a test for interaction. We performed
the analyses using an intention-to-treat approach. We
conducted

tests
and
set
the
probability of type I error at 0.05. All calculations
and graphs were performed using Review Manager
(RevMan,

Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).
The protocol had been registered in the Prospero
database (CRD42017068989).
Results
Database searches and scanning of references yielded
880 articles. From these we finally identified 22 random-
ized clinical trials for inclusion in seven areas of interest
(Additional file 1: Figure S1): use of a pre-procedure
check-list (1 study) [10], pre-oxygenation and apneic
oxygenation (6 studies) [11–16], sedatives (3 studies)
[17–19], neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) (1
study) [20], patient’s position (1 study) [21], videolaryn-
goscopy (9 studies) [22–30], and post-intubation recruit-
ment maneuver (RM) (1 study) [31].
One multicenter RCT evaluated the efficacy of a ver-
bally performed 10-item pre-intubation checklist [10]
compared to no checklist in 262 enrolled critically ill pa-
tients: no difference was found in any outcome (lowest
peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), lowest systolic
blood
pressure,
number
and
length
of
intubation
attempts,
life-threatening
episodes,
or
in-hospital
mortality).
The six RCTs focusing on pre-oxygenation and ap-
neic oxygenation were heterogeneous in treatment
and comparator groups [11–16]. Pre-oxygenation re-
fers to the administration of oxygen before induction
(though some oxygen delivery devices used for pre-
oxygenation can then be left on after induction or
even during laryngoscopy). Apneic oxygenation refers
to oxygen applied to a patient who is not spontan-
eously breathing (i.e. during induction-to-laryngoscopy
and laryngoscopy-to-intubation periods). The charac-
teristics and findings of these six RCTs (563 patients
overall) are summarized in Table 1. The two studies
applying
non-invasive
ventilation
(NIV)
for
pre-
oxygenation compared to standard pre-oxygenation
showed positive results [11, 13] In a meta-analysis of
the
five
studies
applying
high-flow
nasal
cannula
(HFNC) [12–16], stratified for the application as pre-
oxygenation tool and/or as apneic oxygenation tool,
limited evidence suggests that HFNC is ineffective if
used for apneic oxygenation, while it might have
some efficacy in improving the levels of lower oxygen
saturation, but without improving the incidence of se-
vere
desaturation
if
used
for
pre-oxygenation
(Additional file 1: Figures S2 and S3).
Three studies compared sedatives. Sivilotti et al. com-
pared thiopental, fentanyl and midazolam (together with
NMBA) during rapid sequence induction in the ED in
86 critically ill patients [17]: thiopental slightly shortened
the time to intubation but was associated with lower re-
duction in systolic blood pressure compared to fentanyl
and midazolam, while midazolam was associated with an
increase in heart rate compared to fentanyl and thiopen-
tal. In the second study, alfentanil, sufentanil, and fen-
tanyl were compared during rapid sequence intubation
(RSI) in the ED in 90 trauma patients [18]: no significant
difference in hemodynamic parameters was observed.
Finally, Jabre et al. evaluated etomidate versus ketamine
in 469 critically ill patients in 12 EDs and 65 ICUs in
France [19]: no difference in intubation conditions or
intubation-related adverse events was found.
In the only RCT on NMBA, succinylcholine was com-
pared to rocuronium for RSI in 401 ICU patients [20]:
no difference was observed in intubation conditions, rate
of success of first attempt, and oxygen desaturation
episodes, but the duration of the intubation sequence
was on average 14 seconds shorter with succinylcholine.
One multicenter trial compared the sniffing position
(entire bed flat, with the patient’s head elevated) and
ramped position (upper half of the bed raised at an angle
of 25° and the neck extended to have the patient’s face
parallel to the ceiling) during laryngoscopy in 260 pa-
tients [21]. The sniffing position allowed a better view of
the glottis across the full range of body mass indices and
prior level of experience, and reduced the number of in-
tubation attempts; however, it did not improve oxygen-
ation, hemodynamic, or other clinical outcomes.
Nine studies compared different models of videolaryn-
goscopy to direct, traditional laryngoscopy in different
conditions and settings in 2069 patients (Table 2)
[22–30]. Time to intubation and first-attempt success
rate
were
the
most
relevant
reported
outcomes.
Videolaryngoscopy did not shorten the time to intub-
ation (Fig. 1a), nor the first-pass success rate (Fig. 1b),
even when evaluating the studies according to the
greater or lesser experience of the operators, or accord-
ing to the setting (ICU versus ED), or the model used
(hyper-angulated vs non-hyper-angulated) (Additional
file 1: Figures S4 − S6). Four studies [22, 25, 27, 29] ana-
lyzed the subgroups with anticipated difficult airways: no
study found a difference in the outcomes. The two lar-
gest trials found an increased incidence of severe com-
plications in post-hoc analyses when videolaryngoscopy
was employed: Yeatts et al. reported longer duration of
the intubation procedure, greater incidence of severe de-
saturation episodes and highest mortality rate in the
group with severe head injury, while Lascarrou et al. re-
ported an increased incidence of life-threatening compli-
cations [22, 29].

 Finally, Constantin JM et al. evaluated the efficacy of
an RM (40 cmH2O for 30 seconds) immediately after
successful RSI in 40 ICU hypoxemic patients [31]. The
RM group had significantly higher arterial pO2 both 5
and
30
minutes
after
the
RM;
no
difference
in
hemodynamic parameters was observed, although one
RM was interrupted due to hypotension.
Discussion
Key findings
We performed a systematic review focusing on RCTs
evaluating drugs, techniques or devices aimed at improv-
ing the success rate or the safety of tracheal intubation
in adult critically ill patients in the ICU, ED or general
wards. We identified 22 trials focusing on seven different
areas. Our main findings were a possible beneficial role
of pre-oxygenation with NIV and/or HFNC, the negative
effect of thiopental on blood pressure, and the possible
efficacy of post-intubation recruitment in increasing
arterial PaO2. HFNC for apneic oxygenation seems inef-
fective; the sniffing position reduced the number of in-
tubation attempts, without improving clinically relevant
outcomes. No other significant beneficial or negative ef-
fect was observed among the other evaluated interven-
tions such as use of a checklist, choice of opioids, choice
of etomidate versus ketamine, choice of rocuronium ver-
sus succinylcholine, and use of a videolaryngoscope
(which on the contrary was associated with increased
adverse events in four trials).
Relationship to previous studies
Tracheal intubation of critically ill patients is a common
procedure and is frequently complicated by severe ad-
verse events, with an incidence ranging from 4.2 to 39%
[1, 4–7]. To improve safety or efficacy of the procedure,
standardization of the approach was proposed in the
form of bundle or checklist [2, 9] including identification

 opinion or non-randomized studies. Furthermore, they
are derived from guidelines developed for a different set-
ting (elective intubation in the operating theatre) where
airway-management-related deaths are 30-fold less com-
mon than in the ICU and ED and brain damage 60-fold
less common [32]. Hence, we decided to perform a
systematic review to identify the best available evidence-
base on the topic, help improve daily practice and in-
form future research.
The only RCT comparing a pre-intubation checklist to
no checklist did not find any positive effect [10]: these
results are in contrast with the above mentioned before-
after study [3], and in line with another observational
study [9]. A different choice of items could at least in
part explain the difference: the positive results were
obtained in a center with extensive experience in intub-
ation specifically in critically ill patients, while the
checklist of the RCT derived from the opinions of
experts in airway management and from guideline-
recommended steps for intubation, not focused on crit-
ically ill patients [9]. The present systematic review
could contribute to identify the most relevant items to
be included in future checklists.
Pre-oxygenation of patients to be intubated has a
strong rationale, extending the duration of safe apnea
during laryngoscopy before the patient reaches critical
levels of hypoxemia [33]. Apneic oxygenation can be
complementary
to
pre-oxygenation
techniques
[34].
Pre-oxygenation before intubation of critically ill pa-
tients and, above all, of hypoxemic patients, is crucial.
However, the techniques commonly applied in the oper-
ating room (spontaneous breathing of high concentra-
tion of oxygen applied by face mask for some minutes,
followed by manual ventilation by a bag-valve mask)
might be not effective or feasible in the deranged physi-
ology of ICU and ED patients. Our findings suggest that
HFNC might improve pre-oxygenation; on the other
hand, apneic oxygenation with HFNC seems ineffective.
These findings are in line with a recent meta-analysis
[35] also including a non-randomized trial: apneic oxy-
genation with HFNC reduced severe desaturation in
elective intubation in the operating room (OR), but not
in ICU patients with respiratory failure. On the contrary,
NIV applied for 3 minutes before laryngoscopy resulted
in a better safety profile reducing the incidence of severe
desaturation episodes, without NIV-related complica-
tions [11]: NIV may be regarded as a useful approach to
pre-oxygenation in critically ill patients, above all in hyp-
oxemic patients, even if it was evaluated only in a single,
small study.
Three unrelated heterogeneous RCTs evaluated seda-
tives. The only large one evaluated etomidate versus
ketamine, finding no difference [19]: a Cochrane meta-
analysis also investigating non-intubation-related adverse
Fig. 1 Videolaryngoscopy vs. direct laryngoscopy: forest plot for intubation time (a) and for first-attempt successful intubation (b)

 effects of etomidate in critically ill patients concluded
that its use is not associated with worsening of mortality,
organ dysfunction or resource utilization, even if it nega-
tively affects adrenal gland function [36]. Unfortunately,
and surprisingly, no RCT evaluated the very commonly
used sedative propofol in this context.
Marsch at al. found that succinylcholine and rocuro-
nium for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) are equivalent,
even if the duration of intubation was longer with rocur-
onium [20]. It should be noted that the study did not
consider the potential beneficial role of the antagonist
sugammadex when using rocuronium [37]. Moreover,
even if RSI is commonly considered the technique of
choice in critically ill patients [38], graded sedation in-
tubation not using NMBA has also been proposed and
applied [28, 37–40]. Unfortunately, the two approaches
have never been compared.
In a multicenter study, the sniffing position during
laryngoscopy improved the rate of first-attempt success
rate compared to the ramped position, without improv-
ing oxygenation and hemodynamic parameters [21].
These findings are in contrast with previous studies, in
which the ramped position provided a better view of the
glottis [41–43] and seemed to improve pre-oxygenation
[44, 45]. However, all previous studies were performed
in the operating room in elective patients.
Tracheal intubation of critically ill patients is associ-
ated with increased frequency of difficult intubation
compared with elective intubation in the operating the-
atre [1, 7, 8]. Furthermore, multiple attempts at intub-
ation
are
associated
with
a
higher
risk
of
severe
complications, due to the limited physiological reserve
of these patients [5]. Our findings suggest that videolar-
yngoscopes do not perform better than traditional direct
laryngoscopy across a wide range of conditions, even if
they could offer better visualization of the glottis. On
the contrary, four trials found an increased incidence of
severe complications when videolaryngoscopy was used
[22, 29]. Our results are in line with two recent meta-
analyses of randomized trials on videolaryngoscopy lim-
ited to the ICU setting [46, 47], and in contrast with a
previous meta-analysis on videolaryngoscopy in the ICU
setting also including non-randomized trials and report-
ing an increased first-pass success rate (but not a
reduction in complications) [48]. Moreover, a recent
meta-analysis including 64 studies (61 performed in
elective surgical patients) concluded that videolaryn-
goscopy may reduce the number of failed intubations,
particularly among patients with a difficult airway,
but no evidence indicates that they reduce the num-
ber of intubation attempts, the incidence of hypoxia
or respiratory complications, and/or the time required
for intubation [49]. Available evidence does not sup-
port the routine use of videolaryngoscopy in critically
ill patients; moreover, videolaryngoscopy might be as-
sociated with an increased incidence of severe adverse
events.
In a small RCT, an RM after intubation improved oxy-
genation at 5 and 30 minutes, without any other differ-
ence
in
hemodynamic
parameters.
RM
has
been
evaluated mainly in acute lung injury and acute respira-
tory distress syndrome, but its role is still debated [50].
Based on this single RCT, RM could be useful after in-
tubation in hypoxemic patients, even if its effect declines
after 30 minutes.
Implications of study findings
Our findings imply that, in hypoxemic patients, time
permitting, pre-oxygenation by NIV and/or HFNC could
offer the best safety profile; post-intubation RM can fur-
ther enhance arterial oxygenation. The sniffing position
might be the position of choice for laryngoscopy. Thio-
pental should be avoided, above all in hemodynamically
unstable patients.
Strengths and limitations
The present study has several strengths. It is the first
systematic review comprehensively evaluating all steps
of tracheal intubation in critically ill patients in every
setting (the ICU, ED, and general wards). Moreover, it
is based only on evidence from RCTs. Our findings
are relevant to the development of evidence-based al-
gorithms on the topic. Furthermore, we identified the
lack of data in many areas, hopefully informing future
research.
The main limitation of the present systematic re-
view is its inability to offer robust suggestions about
crucial areas. In particular, no RCT evaluated the role
and compared the performance of different scores to
predict difficult intubation [2, 9], the best monitoring
and equipment, the role of supervision, the best asso-
ciated drugs (in particular the role of propofol, a
commonly used sedative), the best way to face pre-
dicted and unpredicted difficult airways scenarios, the
role of fiber optic bronchoscopy and supraglottic de-
vices, the best strategy to confirm tracheal intubation,
and how to prevent or treat hemodynamic instability
[2, 9]. RCTs and meta-analyses cannot be the only el-
ements guiding daily practice, as many aspects remain
(and will likely remain) unexplored by RCTs. In these
areas, we still depend largely on expert opinions, low-
quality studies and algorithms developed for the OR.
As the Fourth National Audit Project conducted in
the UK on major complications of airway manage-
ment concluded, airway management in the ICU and
ED
is
still
under-explored
[6].
Nevertheless,
our

 findings allow the definition of more robust evidence-
based strategies and will inform future research.
Conclusions
We identified and meta-analyzed 22 RCTs in seven dif-
ferent areas, evaluating drugs, techniques or devices
aimed at improving the success rate or the safety of tra-
cheal intubation in critically ill patients. The main find-
ings were a possible beneficial role of pre-oxygenation
with NIV and/or HFNC, the effect of the ramped pos-
ition in increasing the number of intubation attempts,
the negative impact of thiopental on blood pressure, and
the possible efficacy of post-intubation RM in increasing
arterial PaO2. No other significant effect was found in
the use of a checklist, choice of drugs, neuromuscular
blockers, and use of videolaryngoscopy (the latter being
associated with severe adverse effects in four trials).
Further research in this poorly explored area is required.
