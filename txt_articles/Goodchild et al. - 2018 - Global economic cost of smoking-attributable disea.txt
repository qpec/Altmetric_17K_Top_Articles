 Global economic cost of smoking-attributable
diseases
Mark Goodchild,1 Nigar Nargis,2 Edouard Tursan d’Espaignet1
ABSTRACT
Background The detrimental impact of smoking on
health has been widely documented since the 1960s.
Numerous studies have also quantified the economic
cost that smoking imposes on society. However, these
studies have mostly been in high income countries, with
limited documentation from developing countries. The
aim of this paper is to measure the economic cost of
smoking-attributable diseases in countries throughout
the world, including in low- and middle-income settings.
Methods The Cost of Illness approach is used to
estimate the economic cost of smoking attributable-
diseases in 2012. Under this approach, economic costs
are defined as either ‘direct costs’ such as hospital fees
or ‘indirect costs’ representing the productivity loss from
morbidity and mortality. The same method was applied
to 152 countries, which had all the necessary data,
representing 97% of the world’s smokers.
Findings The amount of healthcare expenditure due to
smoking-attributable diseases totalled purchasing power
parity (PPP) $467 billion (US$422 billion) in 2012, or
5.7% of global health expenditure. The total economic
cost of smoking (from health expenditures and
productivity losses together) totalled PPP $1852 billion
(US$1436 billion) in 2012, equivalent in magnitude to
1.8% of the world’s annual gross domestic product
(GDP). Almost 40% of this cost occurred in developing
countries, highlighting the substantial burden these
countries suffer.
Conclusions Smoking imposes a heavy economic
burden throughout the world, particularly in Europe and
North America, where the tobacco epidemic is most
advanced. These findings highlight the urgent need for
countries to implement stronger tobacco control
measures to address these costs.
INTRODUCTION
The detrimental impact of smoking on physical
health and well-being has been widely documented
throughout the world since the early 1960s.1
2
Numerous studies have also quantified the eco-
nomic
cost
that
smoking
imposes
on
society.
However, these studies have mostly been in high-
income countries, with less documentation avail-
able
from
developing
countries.3
Today,
the
growing
burden
of
non-communicable
diseases
(NCDs) in developing countries has further heigh-
tened interest in monitoring the economic cost of
associated risk factors such as tobacco use.
Global concern about the impact of NCDs
resulted in the 2012 Political Declaration of the
High-Level Meeting of the United Nations General
Assembly
on
the
Prevention
and
Control
of
Non-communicable
Diseases.4
This
Declaration
notes with grave concern the ‘increased burden that
NCDs impose through impoverishment from long-
term treatment costs, and from productivity losses
that threaten household incomes and the econ-
omies of Member States’. In 2015, the UN General
Assembly
also
adopted
the
2030
Agenda
for
Sustainable Development.5 It includes 17 Goals
(sustainable development goals (SDGs)) that all
Member States have agreed to achieve by 2030.
SDG 3 to ‘ensure healthy lives and promoting well-
being for all ages’ includes target 3.4 to reduce by
one-third premature mortality from NCDs, and
target 3.a to strengthen country implementation of
the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco
Control (WHO FCTC).5–7
The WHO has previously noted that—despite
some good progress—many countries have yet to
introduce tobacco control measures at their highest
level of implementation. This has left their popula-
tions at increased risk from tobacco use and
secondhand smoke exposure, with the illness, dis-
ability and death they cause.8 All countries have the
ability to implement proven cost-effective tobacco
control policies to protect the health of their
citzens.9 10 T
obacco control can potentially make a
significant contribution towards the achievement of
development priorities such as the SDGs.
The aim of this study is to measure the global
economic cost of smoking-attributable diseases (ie,
those caused by direct exposure to smoking). These
findings will highlight the need for countries to
implement more comprehensive tobacco control
measures to address these economic costs, while
also helping to achieve global development prior-
ities under the SDGs.
METHODS
This study adopts a classic Cost of Illness approach
to modelling the economic impact of an illness as
developed by Rice and colleagues in the 1960s.3
Under this approach, the gross economic impact of
an illness is divided into ‘direct costs’ incurred in a
given year (eg, hospitalisation and medications) and
‘indirect costs’ representing the value of lost prod-
uctivity in current and future years due to disability
and mortality. Direct and indirect costs are then
summed to provide the overall economic cost to
society, often expressed as a percentage of annual
gross domestic product (GDP).11 This approach
has been used in the vast majority of studies on the
economic costs of smoking, particularly in develop-
ing countries.3 12 Some variations of this approach
have been developed over time, for example, the
life cycle approach to direct cost estimation. W
e
compare
these
developments
with
the
classic
approach in our discussion section.

e were able to collect the necessary data to complete our
calculations for 152 countries, representing 97% of the world’s
smokers. The countries were grouped according to W
orld Bank
income status and WHO region. Key results for all countries are
contained in the online supplementary material file. The find-
ings are reported in international dollars using International
Monetary Fund (IMF) purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange
rates for 2012. The use of international dollars (PPP$s) is
common practice to ensure that the estimation of economic
costs in different countries are comparable, and properly reflect
underlying differences in the cost of living for people in coun-
tries at different levels of development.13 However, we also
report the key findings in US dollar (US$) terms.
Estimation of direct costs
Cost of Illness studies often categorise direct costs into either
healthcare or non-healthcare expenditures. Healthcare expendi-
tures are those incurred from the diagnosis and treatment of
smoking-attributable diseases (hospitalisation, physician services,
medications,
etc),
while
non-healthcare
expenditures
are
incurred outside of the health system (eg, property loss from
fires caused by cigarettes). For the purpose of this study, we
limit our investigation of direct costs to healthcare expenditure.
A
literature
search
was
undertaken
to
gather
data
on
smoking-attributable healthcare expenditures in different coun-
tries.
W
e
searched
four
bibliographic
databases
(EconLit,
EMBASE, PubMed and Cochrane), checked the reference list of
recent systematic reviews and searched Google for grey litera-
ture.12 Studies were included if they were published in the past
25 years, calculated health costs on an annual basis and included
at least three major smoking-attributable diseases. The reasoning
behind these search criteria was to assess the finding of studies
that were comparable in scale and scope. Titles and abstracts
were screened before potentially eligible studies were assessed
by two reviewers. Studies were then excluded if they were
funded by the tobacco industry, or were for areas that are not
UN Member States (we lack the background data for provinces
or special administrative regions). Overall, the literature search
found 33 studies covering 44 countries.14–46
These 44 countries are shown in table 1 alongside back-
ground information such as the W
orld Bank income status and
smoking-attributable death (SAD) rate for each population as
reported by WHO.47 Based on the 2012 WHO Global Health
Expenditure database, these 44 countries accounted for 86% of
total health expenditure (THE) worldwide in international
dollar terms.48
The final column of table 1 shows the proportion of health
expenditure that each of these studies found to be attributable
to smoking. These smoking-attributable fractions (SAFs) were
reported by the authors, with the exception of the studies for
Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil and Thailand. W
e calculated the
SAF for these four countries by dividing the authors’ estimate of
the absolute amount of smoking-attributable health expenditure
(SAHE) by THE for the relevant year.
The dollar amount of SAHEi in all of these 44 countries was
then calculated for 2012 as:
SAHEi ¼ SAFi � THEi;
where ðSAFiÞ is the smoking-attributable fraction for each
country ðiÞ and ðTHEiÞ is total health expenditure in PPP$ for
2012.
Simple linear regression analysis was then used to estimate the
SAF in countries not included in table 1. Figure 1 shows that
there is a strong correlation between the SAF and the SAD rate
in our sample of 44 countries form the literature search.
Although this correlation alone does not prove causation, the
direction of the relationship seems clear (ie, as the disease
burden from smoking increases, a greater share of health
resources is allocated to treat them). Simple linear regression
analysis confirms the statistical strength of this relationship, with
an adjusted R2 of 0.9219 and a p value of <0.001. Note that
GDP/capita was initially included in the analysis to control for
income, but was found to be insignificant. The model was also
tested for heteroscedasticity using White’s test and specification
error
for
omitted
variables
using
Ramsey
regression
specification-error test in STATA 13. The regression is run
through the origin after finding insignificant constant term.
The
regression
coefficient
from
the
estimated
equation
SAF
¼ 0:024643SAD and the SAD rate was used to estimate
the SAF for health expenditure in the countries not included in
table 1. These SAFs were then multiplied by THE for each
country as before to arrive at the SAHE. Note—since the major-
ity of global health expenditure has already been accounted for
by the 44 countries in table 1—this approach was applied to
countries that constitute just 14% of total global health
expenditure.
Estimation of indirect costs
Indirect costs measure the economic loss associated with excess
levels of morbidity and mortality caused by smoking-attributable
diseases. This economic loss has been quantified in our study
using the human capital method (HCM), which calculates the
present value of labour productivity loss due to morbidity and
mortality. As discussed, the HCM has also been used in the vast
majority of studies on the economic cost of smoking.3 12
The first step is to establish the physical burden of disease
among smokers in the working-age population. This study uses
updated WHO estimates for each Member State of the number
of SADs among adults aged 30+in 2012 (WHO. WHO global
report: mortality attributable to tobacco. Geneva; W
orld Health
Organization; forthcoming). These estimates are based on the
methodology pioneered by Peto (1992) with a further explan-
ation available in WHO (2012).47
49 The causes of death
include tuberculosis, lower respiratory infections, malignant
neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases. The
age cohorts include adults aged 30–59 and 60–69 years, with
the latter being the best available approximation for age of
retirement.
With respect to morbidity, earlier WHO estimations in 2004
included the number of disability adjusted life years (DALYs)
lost to smoking—where the DALY measure defines morbidity as
the number of years lost to disability (YLD). This study updates
the 2004 estimates of smoking-attributable years lost to disabil-
ity (SYLDijka) to 2012 using the following calculation:
SYLDijka ¼ PROPijka � YLDijka;
where ðPROPijkaÞ is the fraction of years lost to disability attrib-
utable to smoking by gender ð jÞ, age ðaÞ and disease (k) for
country ði) in 2004, and ðYLDijkaÞ is the absolute number of
years lost to disability in 2012 for the same gender, age, disease
and country. As the SAF for YLDs in 2012 was not available,
the fraction from 2004 was instead applied to the disability sta-
tistics
contained
in
the
2012
Global
Burden
of
Disease
database.50
The estimates of smoking-attributable disability and mortality
were then converted into equivalent labour years lost using the

the WHO global report on mortality attributable to tobacco,
while smoking-attributable disability was separately updated to
2012
using
the
Global
Burden
of
Disease
database.50
Employment-to-population ratios for each Member State was
taken from the W

FINDINGS
Health burden and labour loss
T
able 2 summarises the physical burden of disease and labour
force loss due to smoking-attributable diseases in 2012 cate-
gorised by W
orld Bank income group and WHO region.
Smoking caused 2.1 million deaths and 13.6 million years lost
to disability (YLDs) among adults aged 30–69. Note that these
2.1 million deaths reflect a subset of the total 5 million deaths
directly attributable to smoking.47 In total, smoking-attributable
diseases accounted for 12% of all deaths among the world’s
working-age population, with this proportion being highest in
Europe and the Americas where the tobacco epidemic is at a
late or mature stage of development.
The main impact on the labour market occurs via the per-
manent loss of workers due to early mortality. In 2012, it is esti-
mated that the total 2.1 million SADs included 1.4 million
deaths in those adults who otherwise would have been in the
workforce (eg, representing a global adult employment rate of
around 67%). The number of labour years lost (LYLs) due to
smoking-related mortality includes the future labour years fore-
gone
until
retirement.
The
number
of
LYLs
due
to
smoking-attributable diseases came to 26.8 million years, with
18.0 million years lost due to mortality and 8.8 million years
lost due to disability.
Smoking-attributable health expenditure
T
able

summarises
the
global
economic
cost
of
smoking-attributable diseases in 2012, with the two main com-
ponents being direct smoking-attributable health expenditures
(SAHE) and indirect costs from productivity losses due to
smoking-attributable disability and mortality. These findings are
also categorised by W
orld Bank income group and WHO region.
SAHE
totalled
PPP$467
billion
(equivalent
to
US$422
billion) in 2012, and accounted for 5.7% of THE worldwide.
This proportion was highest in HICs, the Americas and Europe.
In Eastern Europe—where the tobacco epidemic is generally the
most advanced—our calculations suggest that smoking is respon-
sible for around 10% of THE in this subregion.
Indirect and total economic loss
The indirect cost of smoking-attributable diseases is estimated at
PPP$1385 billion (US$1014 billion), with disability accounting

 for PPP$446 billion (US$357 billion) and mortality accounting
for PPP$939 billion (US$657 billion), respectively. The total
economic cost of smoking is thus estimated at PPP$1852 billion
(US$1436 billion), equivalent in magnitude to 1.8% of the
world’s annual GDP
. Almost 40% of the total economic cost
occurs in low-income and middle-income countries reflecting
the substantial loss these countries suffer due to tobacco use.

China) account for as much as 25% of the total economic cost
of smoking.
The economic burden of smoking is proportionately highest
in Europe, where the cost of smoking-attributable diseases is
equivalent in magnitude to 2.5% of the region’s annual GDP
.
This includes significant subregional variation, with the costs in
Eastern Europe amounting to as much as 3.6% of GDP com-
pared with 2.0% in the rest of Europe. Similarly, the costs in
Canada and the USA combined represent 3.0% of GDP com-
pared with 1.0% in the rest of the Americas. The cost of
smoking-attributable diseases is proportionately lowest in Africa
and the Eastern Mediterranean region where smoking preva-
lence and the intensity of tobacco use is currently low compared
to the ‘high burden’ populations like Eastern Europe. Many
countries in Africa and other regions are still at an early stage of
the epidemic, and the full societal cost of smoking may not be
evident yet.
DISCUSSION
In this section, we discuss the findings of our sensitivity ana-
lyses, highlight the limitations of our study for future improve-
ment, and discuss some alternatives to the classic Cost of Illness
approach.
Sensitivity analysis
W
e
explored
the
sensitivity
of
our
findings
for
smoking-attributable healthcare expenditure by using the CI on
the coefficient for SAF (0.022817; 0.026469) and the range of
estimates for the 44 countries in table 1. Based on this sensitiv-
ity test, smoking-attributable health expenditure ranges between
PPP$418 and 514 billion globally, representing between 5.12%
and 6.30% of THE. Similarly, the total economic cost of
smoking ranged between PPP$1803 and 1899 billion globally—
equivalent in magnitude to between 1.76% and 1.85% of
worldwide GDP
.
Study limitations
The estimates in our study relate to direct exposure through
smoking and do not include the harm from secondhand smoke
or smokeless forms of tobacco. Secondhand smoke is respon-
sible for around 600 000 deaths per annum and their inclusion
would thus have a measurable impact on our estimate of the
economic cost of smoking.54 Smokeless tobacco products are

Tob Control: first published as 10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2016-053305 on 30 January 2017. Downloaded from 
 widely used in many countries notably in South-East Asia. In
India, it has been estimated that smokeless tobacco accounts for
as much as 30% of all medical expenditures attributable to
tobacco use.29 Given more detailed monitoring and statistics,
these other forms of exposure can be included in future
estimations.
Our estimation of health expenditures relies on past studies in
this field of research (table 1). These studies examine different
diseases and use different techniques to calculate the SAF
. Thus,
we cannot state that the findings are fully comparable. However,
our search criteria meant that only studies with at least three dis-
eases—typically
malignant
neoplasms,
cardiovascular
and
respiratory diseases—were included in our sample. As these con-
ditions account for the vast majority (>90%) of SADs , we can
claim a reasonable degree of comparability. This is also evident
in the statistical strength of the correlation, as well as the tight
range of results we found in our sensitivity analysis.
Our estimation of indirect cost uses the Human Capital
Method (HCM) to estimate loss in production. While the HCM
is a convenient measure for macroeconomic analysis, it does
have some inherent limitations. For example, the HCM only
calculates the indirect loss for people who are ‘economically
active’ and may not reflect the full loss in societal welfare. W
age
and productivity differentials between countries also mean that
the HCM attributes greater loss to workers in high-income
countries relative to those in low-income and middle-income
countries. Note that our use of PPP$ only partly adjusts for this
bias. Finally, the HCM does not capture the potential dynamic
linkages between health and economic growth through channels
such as demography, education and investment.
Methodological considerations
The healthcare costs associated with smoking have traditionally
been measured on an annual basis. However, there is a growing
body of literature that uses longitudinal information to measure
these costs on a life cycle basis.55 This life cycle approach
yields
a
richer
source
of
evidence
including
for
cost-
effectiveness
analyses.
Nonetheless,
the
annual
approach
remains a valid form of analysis in its own right, and our con-
tribution is to highlight the risk of ‘cost escalation’ particularly
for countries that are still at the early stage of the tobacco epi-
demic (refer figure 1).
Several alternatives to the Human Capital Method (HCM)
have been proposed in recent years. For example, the Friction
Cost Method (FCM) aims to provide a more realistic description
of the loss in economic output by measuring the time it takes
employers to replace workers.56 Under the FCM, long-term
absentees are replaced and production levels are restored after a
period of adjustment. The length of adjustment depends on the
availability of labour (eg, unemployment). The FCM has been
criticised for lacking theoretical underpinnings, and has not
been taken-up widely to date.
The Willingness To Pay (WTP) approach uses different techni-
ques to quantify peoples willingness to pay to avoid death.57
This includes intangible factors like the value of leisure time or
the absence of pain and suffering. The WTP approach has
gained traction due to its grounding in welfare economics. The
FCM yields the lowest estimate of indirect economic loss, while
WTP yields the highest. The HCM yields estimates that are
in-between. The HCM can also be applied relatively easily and
consistently across countries, and arguably continues to be the
most widely accepted approach. Nonetheless, future updates of
this study might usefully include one or more of these alterna-
tive approaches together with the HCM.
CONCLUSION
W
e found that diseases caused by smoking accounted for 5.7%
of global health expenditures in 2012, while the total economic
cost of smoking was equivalent to 1.8% of global GDP
.
Smoking imposes a heavy economic burden throughout the
world, particularly in Europe and North America where the
tobacco epidemic is most advanced. These findings highlight
the urgent need for all countries to implement comprehensive
tobacco control measures to address these economic costs, while
also helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals of
Member States.
What this paper adds
▸ The detrimental impact of smoking on physical health and
well-being has been widely documented throughout the
world since the early 1960s. Numerous studies have also
quantified the economic burden that smoking imposes on
society through avoidable healthcare expenditures and via
indirect losses associated with morbidity and mortality.
▸ These economic studies have mostly been undertaken in
high-income countries, with less documentation available in
developing countries. The rapidly rising burden of
non-communicable diseases in developing countries has
further heightened interest in measuring and monitoring the
economic cost of associated risk factors such as tobacco use.
▸ This paper measures the economic cost of
smoking-attributable diseases throughout the world,
including in low- income and middle-income countries. To
the best of our knowledge, there has previously been no
peer reviewed study published on this subject. The same
Cost of Illness method was applied to 152 countries,
representing 97% of the world’s smokers. We found that
diseases caused by smoking accounted for 5.7% of global
health expenditure in 2012, while the total economic cost of
smoking was equivalent to 1.8% of global gross domestic
product (GDP).
