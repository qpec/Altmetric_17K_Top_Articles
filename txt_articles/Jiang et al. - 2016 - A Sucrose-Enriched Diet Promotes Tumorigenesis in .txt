Abstract
Epidemiologic studies have shown that dietary sugar intake
has a significant impact on the development of breast cancer.
One proposed mechanism for how sugar impacts cancer
development involves inflammation. In the current study, we
investigated the impact of dietary sugar on mammary gland
tumor development in multiple mouse models, along with
mechanisms that may be involved. We found that sucrose
intake in mice comparable with levels of Western diets led to
increased tumor growth and metastasis, when compared with a
nonsugar starch diet. This effect was ascribed in part to
increased expression of 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) and its
arachidonate metabolite 12-hydroxy-5Z,8Z,10E,14Z-eicosate-
traenoic acid (12-HETE). We determined that fructose derived
from the sucrose was responsible for facilitating lung metas-
tasis and 12-HETE production in breast tumors. Overall, our
data suggested that dietary sugar induces 12-LOX signaling to
increase risks of breast cancer development and metastasis.

Introduction
Identifying the risk factors for development of breast cancer is a
continuing public health priority. In various epidemiologic stud-
ies, the risk of breast cancer may be increased by diets with high
intake of added sugar, defined by either glycemic index or gly-
cemic load that physiologically measures the ability of food to
increase postprandial glucose levels (1–3). The per capita con-
sumption of sugar in the United States has surged to 70 lb per year
(4), and an increase in consumption of sugar-sweetened bev-
erages has been identified as an important contributor to the
epidemic of obesity, heart disease, and cancer worldwide (5). The
glucose, insulin, and subsequent Warburg effect have been the
major focuses of investigations into the role of sugar, especially
glucose, in cancer development; however, the inflammatory cas-
cade may be an alternative route of studying sugar-driven carci-
nogenesis that warrants further investigation. No prior studies
have investigated the direct effect of sugar consumption on
development of breast cancer using breast cancer animal models
or examining the purported mechanisms.
Different carbohydrates may have distinct effects on tumori-
genesis. In 1979, Hoehn and colleagues demonstrated that after
injection of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)-anthracene (DMBA), rats that
consumed sucrose/dextrose diets developed more mammary
tumors than rats fed with starch (6). However using the same
rat model, Klurfeld and colleagues observed opposite results that
consumption of a corn starch diet was associated with the most
palpable and largest tumors than rats fed with sucrose or lactose
diets (7). Therefore, the effects of dietary sucrose versus starch on
breast tumor growth are still inconclusive. Furthermore, in these
studies, the authors did not report the effects of carbohydrate diets
on breast tumor metastasis, which could be more susceptible to
dietary factors.
Dysregulation of bioactive lipids, especially cyclooxygenase
and lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonate, collectively
called eicosanoids, or their pathway constituents is implicated
in many degenerative diseases, including inflammation and
cancers (8). These bioactive lipids are critical components of
the cell membrane that are involved in cell membrane function
and cell signaling. Among various lipoxygenases, 12-LOX and
12-HETE are known to play a role in tumorigenesis in animal
models and humans. Overexpression of 12-LOX protein was
detected in multiple types of cancers (9–11). Interestingly, 12-
HETE has been shown to increase the proliferation and inva-
sion of breast cancer cells by induction of collagenase secretion
(12). Tissue 12-LOX protein expression was significantly cor-
related with tumor–node–metastasis staging, suggesting that
12-LOX can be a prognosis marker for breast cancer (13).
Therefore, we hypothesized that dietary sugar induces breast
tumor development by altering 12-LOX signaling. To test this
hypothesis, we performed four dietary intervention studies in
the three animal models including a mouse mammary gland
tumor model that carries a MMTV/unactivated neu transgene, a
human

 orthotopic mouse model, and a breast cancer lung metastasis
mouse model (injected with 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells).
Materials and Methods
Mice
Mice of strain FVB/N-Tg(MMTVneu)202Mul/J were purchased
from The Jackson Laboratory, bred, and housed at the MD
Anderson Cancer Center animal facility. For the MDA-MB-231
orthotopic mouse model, 6- to 8-week-old mice were supplied
from MD Anderson's Department of Experimental Radiation
Oncology and were allowed to acclimatize for 3 days prior to
study initiation. Mice were fed an AIN-76 diet (Harlan Labora-
tories) and water ad libitum. MDA-MB-231 cells (1.5 � 106) were
injected into the fourth mammary fat pad (groin mammary fat).
For the 4T1 orthotopic model, BALB/c mice were purchased from
Charles River Laboratories at 5 weeks old. They were acclimated
for 1 week before being injected with 4T1 mouse breast cancer
cells (1 � 104 cells per mouse) into their fourth mammary fat pad.
Diets
Mice in the four studies were randomized to different diet
groups and fed one of four diets (Supplementary Table S1). Both
starch control and sucrose-enriched diets were made by Research
Diet, Inc. and kept in the refrigerator upon arrival. They were
composed of 15% fat by weight, which equates to 30% of energy
per day for humans. The amount of sucrose was increased from
0 g/kg (control) to 62.5 g/kg, 125 g/kg, 250 g/kg, and 500 g/kg.
Eicosanoid analyses
Frozen mammary tumor tissue (20–25 mg) was analyzed for
eicosanoid levels using a modification of a previously described
method (14).
Study approval
All animal experiments were approved by The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Animal Care and Use
Committee.
Statistical analysis
GraphPad Prism was used to perform statistical tests (t test or
ANOVA). P values less than 0.05 were considered statistically
significant. All data are presented as mean � SEM. �, P < 0.05;
��, P < 0.001 compared with control.
Results and Discussion
At 6 months of age, 30% of MMTV/neu mice on the starch
control diet hadmeasurable tumors, whereas 50%, 58%, and 50%
of mice on the sucrose-enriched diet mice (125, 250, and 500
g/kg, respectively) had developed mammary tumors. The average
tumor weight from the 250 g/kg sucrose diet-fed mice was 50 mg
higher than that of the starch control group (Fig. 1A), indicating
that sucrose not only shortened the onset of mammary tumors but
also increased the proliferation of mammary carcinoma cells.
Histologic examination revealed that the starch control diet–fed
mice had minor hyperplasia in their mammary glands, whereas
mice that were on the 500 g/kg sucrose diet had adenomas in their
mammary glands as early as 3 months of age. Interestingly, dietary
sucrose had no statistically significant effect on body weight
(Supplementary Fig. S1) after 7 months of treatment. This is
consistent with reports in the literature that sucrose does not
affect body weight in rodents (15, 16).
We further investigated the effect of the sucrose-enriched diet on
the growth of primary tumors and metastasis potential using a
mouse orthotopic model injected with mouse mammary carcino-
ma 4T1 cells or human MDA-MB-231 cells. In the 4T1 cell-bearing
mice, both the average weight of primary tumors and numbers of
lungmetastaseswere statistically significantlyhigherinthe250g/kg
sucrose diet group than in the starch control diet group (Fig. 1B).
The average tumor weights were 784.0 � 153.1 mg in the 250 g/kg
sucrose group versus 389.4 � 64.3 mg in the starch control group
(P < 0.05). Histopathologicexamination showed that there were an
average of 6.6 � 2.2 lung nodules due to mammary tumor
metastases in the starch control group but 16.7 � 4.4 nodules in
the 250 g/kg sucrose group (P < 0.05). Similarly, compared withthe
starch control diet, dietary sucrose at a dose of 125 g/kg increased
tumor growth in an MDA-MB-231 cell mouse orthotopic model
(Fig. 1C). Again, in both models the sucrose-enriched diet did not
lead to changes in body weight relative to the control mice (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1). The data from the three breast carcinoma
models consistently showed that sucrose-enriched diets compared
with starch-based control diet, not only shortened the onset and
increased proliferation of mammary gland tumors but also notably
increased the lung metastatic potential of mammary carcinoma.
Sugar has been linked to increased risk of cancer (17, 18); however,
such a link in breast cancer is still controversial. Our animal data
supports the tumor-promoting effect of sugar in breast cancer
development and metastasis.
As high glycemic index food has been shown to increase the risk
of breast cancer (19) and may result in modulation of inflamma-
tion (20), we determined the effects of sugar-enriched diets on
levels of arachidonic acid metabolites, known to be important in
inflammation, in MMTV/neu mouse mammary tumors. Among
various prostaglandins (COX-related metabolites) and HETEs and
HODE (LOXmetabolites), 12-HETE levels were elevated about2.6-
fold in the sucrose diet group, especially in the 250 g/kg group,
compared with that of the starch control diet group (Fig. 2A).
Similarly, the 250 g/kg sucrose-enriched diet increased 12-HETE
levels by 1.8-fold and 2.2-fold in the mammary tumors of 4T1 and
MDA-MB-231 models, respectively (Fig. 2B and C). Other HETE
levelsin the tumortissues are presented inSupplementary TableS2;
with 5-HETE consistently being the lowest and similar levels of 13-
HODE and 15-HETE. We also noticed that breast tumor 5-HETE
was increased by sugar consumption in 4T1 and MDA-MB-231
cell–bearingmicecomparedwiththatinthestarchcontrolfedmice.
We then examined 12-LOX protein levels in the tumor by Western
blotting. There are three isoforms of the 12-LOX enzyme abun-
dance: platelet-type 12-LOX (12-LOX-P), leukocyte-type 12-LOX
(12-LOX-L) and epidermal-type 12-LOX (12-LOX-E, only in
mouse; ref. 21). We observed a detectable level of 12-LOX-L protein
but not 12-LOX-P protein in the tumors generated from mammary
glandsofMMTV/neumice(Fig.2A)and4T1cell–bearingmice(Fig.
2B). The mammary gland tumors that developed from MDA-MB-
231 cells, which originated from human breast cancer, expressed
both 12-LOX-L and 12-LOX-P protein (Fig. 2C). Intriguingly,
although different isoforms of 12-LOX were detected in different
mammary gland carcinoma tissues, we found consistently
increased abundance of 12-LOX protein in the tumor tissue from
mice that consumed high levels of dietary sucrose compared with
control mice. These data imply that sucrose-enriched diets are
associated with increased 12-LOX protein expression and 12-HETE

 levels in mouse mammary gland carcinoma and human breast
tumor tissues, suggesting potential mechanisms through which
dietary sucrose induces tumor growth.
A human study reported that dietary sucrose/fructose/glucose
but not starch is associated with increased risk of breast cancer
(22). This is possibly due to the fact that simple sugars such as
sucrose leads to greater fluctuations in blood sugar (23), which in
turn could cause differences in hormonal patterns and other
metabolisms (17). As sucrose contains half glucose and half
fructose, it is not clear whether glucose or fructose is the active
component of sucrose that contributes to sucrose induced tumor-
igenesis. To tease out the effect of glucose or fructose, we com-
pared the tumorigenic effect of sucrose (250 g/kg) to glucose (125
g/kg), fructose (125 g/kg), and glucose plus fructose diets in 4T1
cell–bearing mice (Fig. 3). We found that in addition to the
sucrose-enriched diet, the fructose-enriched diet and the fructose
plus glucose diets led to larger tumors than that in the control mice
(Fig. 3A). More importantly, the sucrose, fructose, and fructose
plus glucose diets all resulted in significantly more lung metastasis
compared with control diets (1.9 � 0.4 per mouse, 2.2 � 0.4 per
mouse, 2.6 � 0.8 per mouse vs. 0.4 � 0.2 per mouse, respectively),
suggesting fructose may be a major dietary carbohydrate that
contributed to sucrose-induced mammary gland tumorigenesis
and metastasis (Fig. 3B). This is consistent with literature that
described that fructose is associated with more aggressive/meta-
static phenotype of breast cancer cells (24) and its transporters
(GLUT2 and GLUT5) are linked to numerous diseases and syn-
dromes including breast cancer (25). Strikingly, while sucrose diet
continually increased the breast tumor 12-HETE production
(289.3 � 65.6 ng/mg protein), average tumor 12-HETE concen-
tration was significantly higher in tumors from mice fed with
fructose (333.1 � 58.6 ng/mg protein) and with fructose plus
glucose diets (521.3 � 57.3 ng/mg protein) compared with the
12-HETE levels in control diet–fed mice (186.2 � 25.5 ng/mg
protein; Fig. 3C). These data suggest that the fructose component
in the diet is potentially responsible for promoting the primary
tumor growth and tumor metastasis to the lungs of the mice.
Literatures suggest that dietary fructose is taken up by the liver and
converted into lactate and glucose, which are subsequently
released into the circulation or converted into hepatic glycogen
or fat (26); however, it is unclear how fructose alters 12-LOX
abundance and 12-HETE production.
The molecular mechanisms of the effects of sugar/carbohy-
drate-enriched on breast cancer are incompletely understood. The
current study provides a promising mechanism that for the first
time directly links dietary sugar (sucrose/fructose) to breast cancer
development and metastasis, which is worthy of further investi-
gation. Although the 12-LOX/12-HETE signaling has been studied
in cancer for some time, its involvement in tumor development
still remains inconclusive. For example, Dilly and colleagues,
showed that overexpression of 12-LOX increases invasion and
angiogenesis of prostate cancer (27), but Gondek and colleagues
reported that the plasma concentration of 12-LOX was signifi-
cantly higher in the patient with BPH compared to those with
prostate cancer (28). In comparison, in breast cancer, Liu and
colleagues transfected MCF-7 breast cancer cells with 12-LOX and
found that transfection led to a loss of estrogen dependency
and an increased tumor growth (12). Singh and colleagues
observed that serum 12-LOX concentration was significantly
higher in breast cancer patients with lymph node involvement
comparing to that of age-match controls (29). Higher levels of 12-
LOX were also observed in tumors from patients who died of
breast cancer (30). Furthermore, a nonsynonymous polymor-
phism of A12LOX (mRNA, A535G; gln261Arg) has been associ-
ated with increased risk of breast cancer, especially the Arg/Gln
and Arg/Arg variants (31). In line with this, a recent preclinical
study further documented that 12-HETE serves as a key mediator
of tumor cell invasion into lymphatic vessels and formation of

 lymph node metastasis in ductal mammary carcinomas (32). All
this evidence indicates that the 12-LOX/12-HETE axis is a useful
prognostic marker for progression and metastasis of breast cancer.
Our findings suggested that dietary sucrose/fructose–induced 12-
LOX/12-HETE production in breast tumor cells in vivo is a possible
signaling pathway responsible for sugar-promoted tumor growth
in mice. How dietary sucrose/fructose induces 12-HETE and
whether it is a direct or an indirect effect remains in question.
Given that fructose consumption in the U.S. has surged from 0.5
lb/year/person in 1970 to 62.4 lb/year/person in 1997 (33) and
studies have suggested that fructose may play a role in metabolic
syndromes (34, 35), the mechanism by which dietary fructose or
fructose containing sugar (sucrose) affects breast tumorigenesis
and metastasis, especially through the 12-LOX pathways, war-
rants further investigation.
