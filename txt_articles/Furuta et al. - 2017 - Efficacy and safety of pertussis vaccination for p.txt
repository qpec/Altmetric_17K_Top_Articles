Abstract
Background: Worldwide, pertussis remains a major health problem among children. During the recent outbreaks
of pertussis, maternal antenatal immunisation was introduced in several industrial countries. This systematic review
aimed to synthesize evidence for the efficacy and safety of the pertussis vaccination that was given to pregnant
women to protect infants from pertussis infection.
Methods: We searched literature in the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, and OpenGrey
between inception of the various databases and 16 May 2016. The search terms included ‘pertussis’, ‘whooping cough’,
‘pertussis vaccine,’ ‘tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis vaccines’ and ‘pregnancy’ and ‘perinatal’.
Results: We included 15 articles in this review, which represented 12 study populations, involving a total of 203,835
mother-infant pairs from the US, the UK, Belgium, Israel, and Vietnam. Of the included studies, there were two randomised
controlled trials (RCTs) and the rest were observational studies. Existing evidence suggests that vaccinations administered
during 19–37 weeks of gestation are associated with significantly increased antibody levels in the blood of both mothers
and their newborns at birth compared to placebo or no vaccination. However, there is a lack of robust evidence to
suggest whether these increased antibodies can also reduce the incidence of pertussis (one RCT, n = 48, no incidence in
either group) and pertussis-related severe complications (one observational study) or mortality (no study) in infants.
Meanwhile, there is no evidence of increased risk of serious complications such as stillbirth (e.g. one RCT, n = 103,
RR = 0, meaning no case in the vaccine group), or preterm birth (two RCTs, n = 151, RR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.14–5.21) related
to administration of the vaccine during pregnancy.
Conclusion: Given that pertussis infection is increasing in many countries and that newborn babies are at greatest risk of
developing severe complications from pertussis, maternal vaccination in the later stages of pregnancy should continue to
be supported while further research should fill knowledge gaps and strengthen evidence of its efficacy and safety.
Background
Worldwide, pertussis remains a major health problem
among children [1]. Despite infant vaccination pro-
grammes with high coverage rates, many industrialized
countries have recently experienced pertussis outbreaks.
This is partially due to waning immunity following vac-
cination, which typically occurs 4–12 years after the last
booster dose or episode of illness, as well as to decreases
in natural immunity [1, 2]. Pertussis in adults can be a
source of infection for infants under 2 months of age
who have not yet been vaccinated. These first few
months are the period when infants are at greatest risk
of developing pertussis infection and serious complica-
tions such as pneumonia, seizures or brain damage, any
of which could ultimately be fatal [2, 3].
In seeking potential strategies for preventing pertussis
in infants, vaccinating babies at birth was not considered
as the best protection against pertussis. This is because
newborns’ immune systems cannot create antibodies
until they are 2 months old [3], so vaccination cannot

 immediately protect them [4]. Instead, maternal immun-
isation is considered the only available option for pro-
tecting infants against pertussis from birth until the first
vaccinations are given at 2 months [1]. Vaccinating
women in pregnancy is believed to protect infants from
pertussis in two ways. First, it is likely to increase the
transfer of maternal pertussis antibodies through the
placenta [2, 5] and through breast milk [6]. Second, vac-
cination during pregnancy is likely to prevent maternal
infection at the time of delivery, which, in turn, mini-
mises the infant’s potential exposure to pertussis [1].
During the 2011 outbreaks, the United States (US) be-
came the first country to recommend that health care
personnel administer pertussis-containing vaccines to
pregnant women who were between 27 and 36 weeks of
gestation [7]. Pertussis vaccination during pregnancy is
now recommended in several countries, including the
United Kingdom (UK), New Zealand, Belgium, Brazil,
Argentina, Mexico and Israel, to protect infants from the
infection. The rate of pertussis immunisation during preg-
nancy, however, varies across and within countries. In the
UK, approximately 60% of pregnant women received a
pertussis vaccine in 2014 [8]. A US study reported that
nearly 50% of women (n = 5992/12,089) who delivered in
Wisconsin from November 2013 to March 2014 received
a pertussis-containing vaccine (tetanus-diphtheria-acellu-
lar pertussis: Tdap) during pregnancy [9]. There are sev-
eral factors influencing on uptake of maternal pertussis
vaccination such as maternal level of education, maternal
work situation and parity [10]. Studies suggest that one of
the main reasons for low immunisation rates is clinicians’
and/or women’s concerns about the safety of the vaccine
during pregnancy [11–15].
Although increasing evidence suggests that receiving
the pertussis vaccine during pregnancy is effective [16]
and safe [17, 18], little is known regarding the quality of
the evidence. There is also a concern that maternal
vaccine-induced antibodies transferred to the fetus may
inhibit the infant’s immune response to vaccination [19].
Therefore, the current systematic review aimed to syn-
thesise evidence for the efficacy and safety of pertussis
vaccinations that were given to pregnant women to
protect their infants from pertussis. Our primary object-
ive was to examine the efficacy of maternal pertussis
vaccination in reducing the incidence of infant pertussis
compared to placebo or no vaccination. Secondary
objectives were to examine the efficacy of maternal per-
tussis vaccination in: 1) reducing the incidence of severe
complications attributed to pertussis in infants (as
measured by hospital admissions and/or incidence of
pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, or death attributed
to pertussis); and 2) increasing infants’ and mothers’
immune responses (as measured by anti-pertussis anti-
bodies in blood or breastmilk). We also examined 3) the
safety of maternal pertussis vaccination as measured by
adverse vaccine-related outcomes in mothers, and/or
incidence of obstetric or perinatal complications, with a
focus on clinically important outcomes such as hyper-
tensive disorder (e.g. pre-eclampsia and eclampsia),
chorioamnionitis, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-
age, stillbirth and neonatal death.
Methods
Data sources and searches
We carried out systematic electronic searches in the
Cochrane
Central
Register
of
Controlled
Trials
(CENTRAL), Medline, Embase and OpenGrey using a
search strategy that was developed in consultation with
an information specialist. We used both index terms
(e.g. Medical Subject Heading: MeSH) and free-text
terms to maximise the search’s sensitivity. The search
terms included ‘pertussis’
, ‘whooping cough’
, ‘pertussis
vaccine,’ ‘tetanus, diphtheria
and pertussis vaccines’
,
‘Tdap’
, ‘pregnancy’ and ‘perinatal’ (details are shown in
Additional file 1). The citations we retrieved from the
searches were imported into the reference management
software package EndNote X7. After we removed the
duplicates, two authors (MF, JS) independently screened
for relevant articles based on titles, abstracts and de-
scriptors/MeSH terms. We retrieved full texts for poten-
tially relevant studies, and two authors (MF, JS) reviewed
these articles independently to determine whether they
met the inclusion criteria. At the end of each stage, the
review authors discussed their screening results and any
discrepancies
were
resolved
through
consensus.
Additional searches were undertaken by hand searching
the reference lists of the included studies. The searches
were initially completed at the end of February 2015 and
updated on 16 May 2016. We recorded the study
selection process in detail so as to complete a Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
To be eligible, studies had to compare at least one of the
following efficacy or safety outcome measures between
two groups: pertussis or pertussis-containing vaccine vs.
placebo or no vaccination during pregnancy.
Efficacy
� Pertussis infection (either laboratory confirmed or
clinically diagnosed) in infants up to 12 months of
age (primary outcome)
� Severe complications attributed to pertussis (as
measured by hospital admissions and/or incidence of
pneumonia, seizures, brain damage or death attributed
to pertussis) in infants up to 12 months of age
Furuta et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth  (2017) 17:390 
Page 2 of 20
 � Mothers’ and infants’ immune responses (as
measured by anti-pertussis antibodies, i.e. pertussis
toxin, pertactin, filamentous hemagglutinin and/or
fimbriae) in maternal and infant blood at delivery;
anti-pertussis antibodies in infant blood prior to the
first dose of a pertussis vaccine [at approximately 2
months of age] but after the primary infant vaccin-
ation schedule was complete [five to 12 months of
age]; or antibodies in breast milk in colostrum and
up to 12 months after giving birth)
Safety
� Adverse vaccine-related outcomes (e.g. incidence of
any solicited adverse events including local and sys-
temic reactions) following injections
� Obstetric or perinatal complications
We included randomised control trials (RCTs) in which
individual pregnant women were randomly assigned to a
vaccination or a no-vaccination (placebo or no vaccin-
ation) group so that differences in outcomes of babies
born to women with or without the pertussis vaccination
could be examined. If a RCT adopted a crossover design,
we only included outcome data from the first randomisa-
tion
period.
We
excluded
cluster-randomised
trials
because the purpose of our review was to examine the
vaccine’s efficacy and safety at the individual level. Apart
from RCTs, we also included quasi-RCTs and observa-
tional studies that evaluated the vaccine’s efficacy and
safety. We did not apply restrictions based on study set-
tings, but we included only studies written in English.
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
Using data extraction forms designed specifically for this
review, MF extracted information on study design, par-
ticipants, interventions or exposures, and outcomes
measured. JS double-checked the accuracy of data
extraction. Two authors (MF, JS) independently assessed
the risk of bias in the included studies, using the
Cochrane collaboration risk of bias tool for RCTs,
cohort studies and case-control studies [20, 21] as ap-
propriate. We assessed each domain of bias (e.g. se-
quence generation, allocation concealment, blinding,
incomplete outcome, selective reporting for RCTs) and
assigned it one of the following three judgments: low
risk of bias (plausible bias that was unlikely to seriously
alter the results), high risk of bias (plausible bias that
seriously weakened confidence in the results), or unclear
risk of bias (plausible bias that could have raised some
doubt about the results) when there was insufficient in-
formation to make a judgment. We used the Grading of
Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evalu-
ation (GRADE) approach [22] to assign the overall
quality of evidence for each outcome to one of four levels
– high, moderate, low, or very low – according to factors
including within-study risk of bias (methodological qual-
ity), directness of evidence, heterogeneity, precision of ef-
fect estimates and risk of publication bias [21, 22].
Data synthesis and analysis
The extracted outcome data were further checked by a
statistician (ESWN) who conducted statistical analyses.
We used the Mantel-Haenszel method to estimate the
pooled risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) for all dichotomous outcomes, except for one case-
control study for which we produced odds ratios (ORs),
because with this type of study design, the entire at-risk
population cannot be defined and, thus, we could not
calculate RR. For the continuous outcome data, i.e. anti-
pertussis antibodies, underlying data were skewed. We
therefore calculated the ratios of the geometric means
and 95%CIs where group-specific geometric means and
associated CIs were reported for the included studies
[23]. Test of no difference (null hypothesis) between two
geometric means was performed by t-test on the differ-
ence of the log-transformed geometric means.
We performed random effects meta-analyses, where
possible, using Review Manager (RevMan) 5.3 to pro-
duce the average effect sizes of the interventions across
studies. We analysed the data from observational studies
separately from the trial data. Clinical heterogeneity
(variability in the interventions and controls, partici-
pants, settings, and outcomes) and methodological het-
erogeneity (variability in study design and risk of bias)
were assessed within each comparison. We also assessed
statistical
heterogeneity
using
I-squared
and
chi-
squared statistics [21], as well as visually inspecting
the forest plots. We reported study results separately
when there was significant heterogeneity in the stud-
ies’ design and findings.
Results
Our electronic search identified 15,584 articles. After ex-
cluding duplicates, we screened 13,621 titles and/or
abstracts. Of potentially relevant articles (n = 1347), we
examined 91 full-text articles and finally, a total of 15 ar-
ticles met our inclusion criteria (Fig. 1) (details of
excluded studies are shown in Additional file 2). Table 1
summarises the characteristics of included studies. The
articles by Kharbanda et al. [24, 25] reported different
outcomes in the same study population: one focused on
obstetric and perinatal complications [24] and the other
focused on adverse events in mothers occurring within
42 days of vaccination [25]. The articles by Abu Raya et
al. [26, 27] also reported different outcomes in the same
population: one focused on antibodies in maternal and
infant blood [26] and the other focused on antibodies in

 breast milk [27]. In addition, it appears that the eligible
sample we included from De Schutter et al. [28] (n = 19
women vaccinated during pregnancy; n = 9 women with
no vaccination for at least 5 years before delivery) were
drawn from the participants in Maertens et al. [29]’s
study. These studies reported different outcomes: one
focused on antibodies in maternal and infant blood as
well as obstetric complications [29] and one focused on
antibodies in breast milk [28]. Altogether, this repre-
sented data from 12 study populations involving a total
of 203,835 mother-infant pairs from the US, the UK,
Belgium, Israel and Vietnam. In terms of study designs,
there were two RCTs (Hoang et al. [30], Munoz et al.
[31]), one of which [31] employed a crossover design
(women who received saline during pregnancy were
given the Tdap postpartum, and women who received it
during pregnancy were given saline postpartum). The
remaining 10 studies (13 articles) were observational
studies: nine cohort studies [5, 24–29, 32–36] and one
case-control study [37].
Many studies selected women who were at low-risk of
obstetric complications; for example, four studies [28–

 31, 33] recruited healthy pregnant women with no
underlying medical conditions, and four [24–27, 31, 33]
recruited only women with singleton pregnancies. Pre-
term birth was excluded in three cohort studies [26–28,
33, 34]. However, one RCT [31] and two cohort studies
[24, 36] specified preterm birth as one of their outcomes
of interest. Women with a recent history of vaccination
and/or pertussis infection were excluded in some studies
to minimise any potential confounding of anti-pertussis
antibodies [26–31].
Intervention/exposure and comparison
In six studies (representing eight articles), the interven-
tion or exposure was immunisation during pregnancy
with Tdap vaccines [24, 26–31, 33, 34, 36]. All US stud-
ies [24, 31, 33, 34, 36] and a Vietnamese RCT [30] used
Tdap, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur (including Ada-
cel, which contains 2.5 μg of pertussis toxoid), whereas
studies in Israel [26, 27] and Belgium [28, 29] used Boos-
trix (containing 8 mcg of pertussis toxoid), manufac-
tured by Glaxo Smith Kline. In the UK studies, the
exposure
were
a
combined
tetanus,
diphtheria,
5-
component acellular pertussis, inactivated polio vaccine
(TdaP-IPV, Repevax, Sanofi Pasteur) [35] or ‘any vaccine
containing
pertussis’ administered
during
pregnancy
[32]. In one UK case-control study [37], the type of per-
tussis vaccination was not reported. The timing of per-
tussis vaccination administration varied between and
within studies from the first to the third trimesters. The
comparator of the Tdap vaccination during pregnancy
was a placebo in one RCT [31] and the tetanus toxoid
(TT) vaccine in another [30]. For observational studies,
women in the comparator-group of one study [34] re-
ceived the vaccination before pregnancy. Otherwise, the
comparator for all the remaining observational studies
was no vaccination during pregnancy.
Risk of bias in included studies
The risk of bias assessment for all included studies is
summarised in Additional file 3 and described below.
RCT
Both RCTs [30, 31] failed to report the processes used to
generate the randomisation sequence and allocation
concealment; thus, these studies were assessed as having
an unclear risk of selection bias. One RCT [31] blinded
investigators and participants but not the vaccine ad-
ministrator, and no information on blinding was avail-
able for the RCT conducted in Vietnam [30]. The trials
were, however, assessed as having a low risk of bias for
the objectively measured outcomes (i.e. antibodies) and
an unclear risk of bias for the self-reported outcomes
(i.e. injection site and systemic reactions, for which the
knowledge of the vaccine’s or the placebo’s uptake might
have affected the way the women or the clinicians re-
ported symptoms). In both trials, the proportion of miss-
ing outcome data was small for the outcomes measured
during pregnancy and delivery, with a 92%–100% com-
pletion rate. However, in the trial in Vietnam that exam-
ined anti-pertussis antibodies in infants aged either two
or 5 months, losses to follow-up were greater than 20%
and 30%, respectively, giving the trial data an unclear
risk of bias for incomplete outcome data collection. The
risk of reporting bias was also rated as unclear in one
trial [31] because some of the vaccine-associated compli-
cations (e.g. hypertension, poor feeding) that were
planned to be measured at various points as stated in
the protocol (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00707148)
were not reported in the paper; in another RCT [30], the
authors did not mention the protocol in the article, al-
though we found the plausible study protocol from clini-
caltrias.gov (identifier: NCT01698346). At the baseline,
no imbalance between the intervention and control
groups was observed in either RCT. However, with the
small sample sizes in each study, the estimated effect
sizes were imprecise, leaving room for potential bias.
Cohort studies
All twelve included articles had unclear or high risks of
bias across several domains. The main issues across
studies were (1) matching or adjusting for prognostic
factors, or (2) assessing prognostic factors. Five articles
were rated as having a high risk [5, 32, 33, 35, 36] and
another seven as having an unclear risk of bias for match-
ing or adjustment for prognostic factors [24–29, 34],
mainly because of potential confounders (e.g. recent
history of pertussis infection or vaccination, or obstet-
ric
characteristics)
that
could
be
associated
with
outcomes were not adjusted for (or not comprehen-
sively adjusted for), and/or data required to assess the
comparability between groups were not presented. For
eight articles [24, 25, 27–29, 32–34], we were also
uncertain regarding the reliability (e.g. accuracy and
completeness) of data from which information on po-
tential confounders were obtained.
Case-control study
For the only case-control study included [37], there were
three domains in which the risk of bias was rated as un-
clear: case selection (some of the eligible pertussis cases
were not included in the analysis), matching of cases
and controls (no matched controls were selected for 28
of 58 pertussis cases), and matching/adjusting for prog-
nostic factors (some important potential confounders
were not adjusted for, such as gestation at vaccination,
breastfeeding status, number of children in households,
childcare attendance, and socio-demographic factors).

 Efficacy
Pertussis infection
One RCT that involved 48 mother-infant pairs [31] and
one
retrospective
cohort
study
that
involved
690
mother-infant pairs [36] reported incidence of pertussis
in infants, but neither identified any pertussis cases in ei-
ther the Tdap-vaccinated or control groups. In both
studies, pertussis incidence was not the primary out-
come of interest; hence, it is likely that the sample sizes
were not calculated to detect differences in incidence.
However, one case-control study [37] showed a signifi-
cant association between maternal antenatal vaccination
and pertussis infection in infants aged less than 8 weeks:
the rate of pertussis vaccination during pregnancy was
significantly lower in mothers of pertussis-positive in-
fants than in mothers of pertussis-negative infants (OR
0.07 [95% CI: 0.03–0.19] after adjustment for sex, geo-
graphic area and birth period). It is worth noting that
case-control studies are not designed for determining
the incidence of a disease, because the case-control ra-
tios are predetermined by the study design [38]. The
quality of the evidence for pertussis incidence was there-
fore rated as low using the GRADE approach because
no direct evidence was available on the incidence in
infants.
Severe complications attributed to pertussis
No study that examined the efficacy of maternal pertus-
sis vaccination during pregnancy reported on differences
in rates of hospitalisation, pneumonia, seizures, brain
damage or death attributed to pertussis in infants. One
case-control study [37], however, reported that a history
of maternal pertussis vaccination during pregnancy was
not associated with a significant difference in the length
of hospital stay for infants (aged <8 weeks) with pertus-
sis (n = 47, median: 4 days in infants of mothers with
antenatal pertussis vaccine vs. 3.5 days in infants of
mothers without the vaccine, p = 0.58). The quality of
the evidence for severe complications attributed to per-
tussis was rated as low using the GRADE criteria be-
cause
the
outcome
examined,
i.e.
the
length
of
hospitalisation, was a proxy measure for the severity of
pertussis complications, and also, only one case-control
study contributed to the outcome.
Mothers’ and infants’ immune response to vaccine
Antibodies in maternal and infant blood Seven stud-
ies [5, 26, 29–31, 33, 34] evaluated antibodies in paired
maternal and cord blood samples, and one evaluated
antibodies in the infant blood samples only. The anti-
bodies were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorb-
ent assay (ELISA) kits from different manufacturers
including Euroimmun [26, 30] and Virion\Serion [29],
although ELISA kits manufacturers were not described
in some studies. However, meta-analyses were not pos-
sible because the included studies were different both in
design (RCT vs. observational) and comparison group
(i.e. placebo, tetanus toxoid, no Tdap during pregnancy
or Tdap before pregnancy) or because of insufficient
data were provided in the original study (i.e. Hardy-
Fairbanks et al. [33] reported neither confidence inter-
vals nor standard deviations of the mean differences).
Table 2 shows the antibody measurements in the
mothers and infants. Two RCTs [30, 31] and three co-
hort studies [26, 29, 33] consistently showed higher anti-
body concentrations at delivery in women who received
Tdap during pregnancy than in their controls (e.g. in
one RCT [n = 48], antibodies in the maternal blood: 51.0
EU/mL [95% CI: 37.1–70.1] in the Tdap-vaccinated
group and 9.1 EU/mL [4.6–17.8] in the placebo group;
ratio of geometric means 5.6 [3.0–10.5]; p < 0.001) and
in their infants at birth (e.g. [31], antibodies in the infant
cord
blood:
68.8EU/mL
[52.1–90.8]
in
the
Tdap-
vaccinated group and 14.0 EU/mL [7.3–26.9] in the pla-
cebo group; ratio of geometric means 4.9 [2.8–8.7]; p <
0.001). There was, however, one cohort study [34] that
reported no significant difference between the groups; in
that study, antibody levels in maternal and infant blood
at delivery were compared between women who received
Tdap during early pregnancy (mean = 9 weeks gesta-
tional age) and those who received it before pregnancy
(10–24 months prior to the birth of the current infant).
Sensitivity analyses that removed three women who had
most likely had recent pertussis exposure (immuno-
globulin G [IgG] to pertussis toxin of >94 EU/mL in ma-
ternal sera) did not change the overall findings; data
were also not available for subgroup analysis by gesta-
tional age at pertussis vaccination. However, nearly all
studies in which the majority of women in the vacci-
nated group received Tdap in late pregnancy showed
significantly higher antibody levels in maternal and in-
fant blood than did the control group (mean gestational
age at vaccination: 26 weeks and 29 weeks in [30] and
[29], respectively; the means were not available, but all
women received Tdap at 30–32 weeks in [31], and the
majority (58 of 61) received it after 27 weeks in [26]).
Only one study in which women received Tdap in early
pregnancy (mean = 9 weeks gestational age) did not find
significant differences in the maternal and infant blood
antibody levels between groups [34].
Table 3 shows the anti-pertussis antibody levels in infant
blood prior to their first pertussis vaccinations at 2
months of age and after completion of the primary infant
vaccination. At month two, one RCT [30] and two cohort
studies [29, 33] showed significantly higher anti-pertussis
antibody levels in infants of mothers vaccinated with Tdap
during pregnancy compared with those of control infants.

 At month five (1 month after the primary infant
vaccination was completed), results were inconsistent,
however. One RCT [30] reported that geometric mean
concentrations of antibodies to pertactin but not to per-
tussis toxin or filamentous hemagglutinin were signifi-
cantly (p = 0.006) lower in the Tdap group than in the
tetanus toxoid group. One cohort study [29] showed that
the geometric mean concentrations of antibodies to
pertussis toxin but not to filamentous hemagglutinin or
pertactin were significantly (p < 0.001) lower in the Tdap
group compared with the unvaccinated group (p <
0.001). There was also one observational study [35] that
showed that geometric mean concentrations of anti-
bodies to pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin,
and fimbriae types 2 and 3 in infants of TdaP/IPV-vacci-
nated mothers (recruited in 2013–2014) were signifi-
cantly lower at 5 months of age (post-vaccination) (p <
0.001) than they were in infants in a historical cohort
(recruited in 2011–2012) whose mothers did not receive
a pertussis-containing vaccine during pregnancy. Based
on GRADE, the quality of evidence was rated as moder-
ate for the antibodies at birth but low for the antibodies
at two and 5 months of age due to inconsistent results
based on few studies as well as issues related to follow-
up rate [30] and comparability [35].
Antibodies in breast milk Two cohort studies [27]
evaluated antibodies in breast milk, using ELISA kits
(Euroimmun). One of these studies [28] evaluated anti-
pertussis toxin secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) at one
time point (8–9 weeks postpartum), and another [27]
evaluated
IgA
to
pertussis
toxin,
filamentous
hemagglutinin and IgG to pertussis toxin and filament-
ous hemagglutinin and pertactin in the colostrum and at
two, four and 8 weeks postpartum. In the colostrum,
there were statistically significant differences between
the Tdap-vaccinated women compared to unvaccinated
women in the geometric mean concentrations of IgA to
filamentous hemagglutinin (one cohort study; n = 32;
24.12 EU/mL [95% CI 14.12–41.2, n = 21] vs. 6.52 EU/
mL [95% CI 2.19–19.41]; p = 0.01) and IgG to pertactin
(one cohort study; n = 32; 2.46 EU/mL [95% CI 1.19–
5.11, n = 21] vs. <0.6 EU/mL; p = 0.03). In the breast milk
at 2 weeks postpartum, the geometric mean concentra-
tions of IgA to filamentous hemagglutinin remains sig-
nificantly
higher
in
the
Tdap-vaccinated
women
compared with women with no vaccination (one cohort
study; n = 30; 3.64 EU/mL [95% CI 2.4–5.51] vs. 1.37
EU/mL [95% CI 0.59–3.19]; p = 0.01]). At 4 weeks post-
partum, there were no statistically significant differences
in any of the measured antibodies in breast milk [27]. At
8–9 weeks postpartum, the results were inconsistent;
one Belgium study [28] showed significantly higher
levels of anti-pertussis IgA in the Tdap-vaccinated
women compared with women with no vaccination for
at least 5 years before delivery (n = 28; 0.55 EU/mL [95%
CI 0.31–0.98] vs. 0.19 EU/mL [95% CI 0.16–0.23]; p =
0.01]), whereas one study in Israel [27] showed no statis-
tically significant differences between the groups. The
quality of the evidence for anti-pertussis antibodies in
breast milk was rated as low using the GRADE criteria
because one or two, small-sample observational study
contributed to the outcome.
Safety
Vaccine-related adverse outcomes
Table 4 shows the results of two RCTs [30, 31] that com-
pared the incidence of adverse reaction outcomes be-
tween the Tdap vaccinated and the control groups. One
RCT [31] conducted in the US showed statistically sig-
nificant differences in the proportion of women who re-
ported injection site reactions within 7 days after
injection: women who had received the Tdap vaccine
were more likely to complain injection site reactions (in
particular pain), than the saline placebo group (n = 48;
26 [78.8%] of 33 in the vaccine group vs. 3 [20.0%] of 15
in the placebo group; RR 3.9 [95% CI 1.41–11.01]).
Other adverse outcomes reported in the RCT [31] were
erythema, swelling, and systemic reactions (fever - oral
temperature ≥ 38 °C, headache, malaise, or myalgia),
none of which showed statistically significant differences
between the two groups. Another RCT [30] conducted
in Vietnam reported that some women who received the
vaccine experienced solicited adverse events such as
stiffness, swelling and itching at the injection site, as well
as fever and fatigue after injection, but there was no sig-
nificant difference in the incidence between the Tdap
vaccine group and the controls, i.e. women with the TT
vaccine [30]. According to the GRADE criteria, the qual-
ity of the evidence for the vaccine related adverse out-
comes was rated as moderate with results obtained by
two RCTs.
Obstetric or perinatal complications
Table 4 presents a wide range of obstetric and perinatal
complications that were evaluated in the included stud-
ies such as hypertensive disorder, chorioamnionitis, pre-
term
birth,
stillbirth
and
neonatal
death.
Results
indicated that there was no increased risk for incidence
of any of these complications in women who received
the antenatal pertussis vaccine compared with women
who did not. One exception was chorioamnionitis, for
which one observational study [24] showed a higher risk
in women who received the vaccine than in women who
did not, even after adjustments by propensity scores
were made for their baseline characteristics (e.g. socio-
demographics and the presence of maternal comorbidi-
ties) (n = 123,494; 1596 [6.1%] of 26,229 in the Tdap-

1.26]). However, importantly, the study did not dem-
onstrate the association between the antenatal pertus-
sis vaccine and increased risk of preterm birth, a
clinically important consequence of chorioamnionitis.
Two additional RCTs [30, 31] and one observational
study [36], in addition to [24], also reported no differ-
ences in incidence of preterm birth
between the
Tdap-vaccinated and unvaccinated groups (two RCTs:
n = 151; 3 [3.5%] of 85 in the Tdap-vaccinated group
vs. 2 [3.0%] of 66 in the unvaccinated group; RR 0.86

[7.8%] of 97,770 in the control group; RR 0.75 [95%

cified

also

which
consistently show no significant difference in the inci-
dence of hypertensive disorders in mothers (three co-

no stillbirth in the vaccine group; two cohort studies,

one study [32] evaluated neonatal death and small-
for-gestational-age; the results were not statistically
different in either outcome.
Following the GRADE criteria, the quality of the
evidence for our prespecified obstetric or perinatal com-
plications was rated as low for neonatal death and small-
for-gestational-age because only one observational study
contributed to the data; but moderate for hypertensive
disorders, preterm birth and stillbirth because three dif-
ferent studies (including one RCT for preterm birth and
stillbirth) showed consistent results.

 Discussion
Summary of main findings
This review demonstrates that antenatal pertussis vac-
cination in middle to late pregnancy is associated with
significantly higher antibody titres in maternal and infant
blood than placebo or no vaccination. Studies testing
maternal vaccinations at an early stage of pregnancy are
small in number and hence evidence, if any for or
against vaccination at an early stage of pregnancy, is
scarce. Regarding safety concerns, there may be rela-
tively minor injection site reactions, such as pain associ-
ated with the vaccine injection. However, the existing
evidence has not demonstrated that having a maternal
pertussis vaccination during pregnancy is associated with
an increased risk of any serious maternal or perinatal
complications such as hypertensive disorder, stillbirth,
neonatal death or pre-term birth.
Comparison with existing policies and guidelines
The UK Department of Health [39, 40] and the Centers
for disease control and prevention (CDC) Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [7] have
both recommended administering the pertussis vaccine
to pregnant women but the optimal timing suggested
are different (at 16–38 weeks gestation according to the
UK Department of Health and at 27–36 weeks gestation
according to ACIP) to maximise maternal antibody re-
sponse, passing more pertussis antibodies from mother
to baby through intrauterine transfer, which in turn pro-
tects the infant from pertussis from the moment of birth
[7]. Our review found that vaccination between 19 and
37 weeks of gestation was associated with higher anti-
body levels in maternal and foetal blood. However, there
is a lack of evidence to suggest whether administering
the vaccination during this time frame also reduces
pertussis and severe pertussis-related complications in
neonates because the relationship between antibody ti-
tres and prevention of pertussis-related complications is
still not fully understood [41, 42]. Although, little is
known regarding whether or to what extent the in-
creased antibody concentrations transferred through
the placenta have a protection effect for pertussis in
neonates, vaccine effectiveness based on UK observa-
tional data is estimated to be around 90% [16, 43],
possibly as a result of both passive antibodies and re-
duced maternal exposure to the infection. The results
of the current review showing no evidence of in-
creased risk of serious adverse outcomes reinforce the
CDC’s recommendation of the pertussis vaccine dur-
ing pregnancy based on its safety.
Strength and limitations of the review
This is the first systematic review, to the authors’ know-
ledge, evaluating the efficacy and safety of pertussis
vaccination during pregnancy. We developed a protocol
(Additional file 4) prior to the review to avoid reporting
bias. The literature search was comprehensive using
multiple electronic databases and manual searches. This
review included observational studies other than RCTs
only, because it was anticipated that there would be few
relevant
studies
—
the
antenatal
pertussis
vaccine
programme was only introduced in 2011 in the US and
in 2012 in the U.K. For the primary outcome of this
review (pertussis infection in infants), there was no ro-
bust evidence from RCTs; the only evidence available
was from one UK case-control study that examined the
association between pertussis infection among infants
and their mothers’ vaccination status during pregnancy,
which limited the generalisability of the vaccine’s efficacy
estimate to protect infants from pertussis in the wider
population as incidences of pertussis vary across differ-
ent populations and health care systems. The review in-
cluded only studies written in English, but no study was
excluded due to the reason of non-English publication.
Some issues related to data (incorrect reporting, missing
or insufficient data) might be further clarified if we had
sought further data from the original researchers, which
was not feasible given our limited resources.

total of 6323 babies whose mothers received a pertussis vaccine during pregnancy and 19,075 babies whose mothers did not receive the vaccine
during pregnancy. I-squared statistics for heterogeneity was 0%

 Differences between protocol and review
There were situations in which we could not apply
methods as planned in our protocol. Meta-analysis was
not possible for nearly all outcomes because only a very
small number of studies, sometimes only a single study,
contributed to each outcome. Even in cases when two or
more studies evaluated the same outcomes, it would not
have been sensible to produce pooled estimates because
the included studies differed in study design (RCT versus
observational studies) or comparators (placebo versus
unvaccinated during pregnancy versus vaccination be-
fore pregnancy). Some of the included studies reported
an insufficient amount of background information. The
lack of data also prohibited our plan to assess the inter-
action effects of the types and timings of vaccination
and study settings through subgroup analyses. We were
also not able to use sensitivity analysis to assess either
study quality or potential bias caused by missing data.
Finally, in this current review, we were not able to assess
publication bias with a funnel plot because a small num-
ber of studies (n ranges from 1 to 3) contributed to each
outcome. This was the case in which hypothesis testing
for publication bias was deemed inappropriate due to
the low power to detect real asymmetry [21].
Conclusion
Recently, there has been a marked increase in the inci-
dence of pertussis in the world, and newborn babies are
at greatest risk of catching this highly infectious disease.
Although pertussis vaccination in pregnancy is now rec-
ommended in several countries worldwide, pertussis
vaccine has not yet been universally provided to the
pregnant women. Our review findings aid evidence-
based decision making for clinicians and public health
commissioners, as well as for the women themselves re-
garding pertussis vaccination during pregnancy. Given
that the existing evidence has not demonstrated that
having a pertussis-containing vaccine during pregnancy
is associated with an increased risk of any serious mater-
nal and perinatal complications, maternal vaccination in
pregnancy should continue to be supported, especially
during the outbreak period, while further research en-
deavours to fill knowledge gaps and strengthen evidence
of the vaccination’s efficacy and safety. Further studies
need to focus on establishing the vaccine’s efficacy and
effectiveness in relation to the prevention of pertussis
and pertussis-related complications in infants through
large, sufficiently powered, placebo-controlled RCTs.
RCTs are also required to allow subgroup analyses that
investigate whether vaccine efficacy differs according to
the timing of vaccine administration, types of pertussis
vaccination, and/or different settings. In particular, there
is currently little evidence from low-income countries,
where the risk of pertussis is higher and cases are more
likely to be fatal; thus, the implications for clinical prac-
tice based on the findings of this review may be different
[44]. There are also issues related to heterogeneity in the
definitions of terms used to assess the safety of vaccina-
tions that makes it difficult to compare vaccine trial re-
sults across different settings. Efforts have been made to
establish a globally shared understanding of outcomes
and to harmonise data collection by the Global Align-
ment of Immunization Safety Assessment in Pregnancy
(GAIA) project supported by the Brighton Collaboration
Foundation [45–48]. In line with these guidelines, on-
going monitoring is vital for the continued safety evalu-
ation of the vaccine during pregnancy.
