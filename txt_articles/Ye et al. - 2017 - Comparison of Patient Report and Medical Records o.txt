IMPORTANCE The comorbid conditions of patients with cancer affect treatment decisions,
which in turn affect survival and health-related quality-of-life outcomes. Comparative
effectiveness research studies must account for these conditions via medical record
abstraction or patient report.
OBJECTIVE To examine the agreement between medical records and patient reports in
assessing comorbidities.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Patient-reported information and medical records were
prospectively collected as part of the North Carolina Prostate Cancer Comparative
Effectiveness & Survivorship Study, a population-based cohort of 881 patients with newly
diagnosed localized prostate cancer enrolled in the North Carolina Central Cancer Registry
from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2013. The presence or absence of 20 medical
conditions was compared based on patient report vs abstraction of medical records.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Agreement between patient reports and medical records
for each condition was assessed using the κ statistic. Subgroup analyses examined
differences in κ statistics based on age, race, marital status, educational level, and income.
Logistic regression models for each condition examined factors associated with higher
agreement.
RESULTS A total of 881 patients participated in the study (median age, 65 years; age range,
41-80 years; 633 white [71.9%]). In 16 of 20 conditions, there was agreement between
patient reports and medical records for more than 90% of patients; agreement was lowest
for hyperlipidemia (68%; κ = 0.36) and arthritis (66%; κ = 0.14). On multivariable analysis,
older age (�70 years old) was significantly associated with lower agreement for myocardial
infarction (odds ratio [OR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.80), cerebrovascular disease (OR, 0.10; 95%
CI, 0.01-0.78), coronary artery disease (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.20-0.67), arrhythmia (OR, 0.44;
95% CI, 0.25-0.79), and kidney disease (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.52). Race and educational
level were not significantly associated with κ in 18 of 19 modeled conditions.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overall, patient reporting provides information similar to
medical record abstraction without significant differences by patient race or educational
level. Use of patient reports, which are less costly than medical record audits, is a reasonable
approach for observational comparative effectiveness research.

 P
rostate cancer treatment decision making and patient
outcomes are greatly affected by patient baseline co-
morbid conditions.1,2 Because the median age of diag-
nosis of prostate cancer in the United States is 67 years,3 many
patients have other medical conditions concomitantly, such
as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cere-
brovascular disease.4,5 Radical prostatectomy is a more likely
treatment given to younger patients with fewer comorbidi-
ties,whereasradiotherapyandconservativemanagement(hor-
mone therapy or no treatment) are more likely given to older
patients and those with more comorbidities.3,6-8 Another
study9suggeststhatpatientswithfewercomorbiditiesaremore
likely to travel long distances to receive treatment at large-
volume academic centers.
Comparative effectiveness of patient outcomes among dif-
ferent localized prostate cancer treatment options is one of the
highest-priority research areas according to the Institute of
Medicine.10 Because a patient’
s comorbid conditions heavily
influence treatment selection and directly affect survival and
health-relatedquality-of-lifeoutcomes,1,2,11observationalcom-
parative effectiveness research studies must account for these
conditions. A central methodologic issue is whether to col-
lect comorbidity data using medical record abstraction or pa-
tient report to maximize data quality while minimizing cost
of data collection. Medical record collection and abstraction
depend on the scrupulousness of the documenting health care
professional, require an abstractor with sufficient medical
training, and are more costly to perform.12 On the other hand,
patient report relies on each patient accurately knowing his or
her medical history, which may be dependent in part on his
or her health literacy. For observational comparative effec-
tiveness research, it is not clear that a current criterion stan-
dard exists, and each source of information (patient vs medi-
cal records) has the potential to overreport and underreport
comorbid medical conditions.
The purpose of this study was to compare patient reports
and medical records in assessing comorbidity in a population-
based cohort of patients with newly diagnosed prostate can-
cer.Wequantifythelevelofagreementbetweenthese2sources
on common comorbid conditions and assess factors associ-
ated with agreement. Given that socioeconomic status is as-
sociated with health literacy,13,14 we hypothesized that pa-
tients who were nonwhite and those with lower educational
levels would have lower agreement between patient reports
and medical records.
Methods
Data Collection
The North Carolina Prostate Cancer Comparative Effective-
ness&SurvivorshipStudy(NCProCESS)isaprospective,popu-
lation-based cohort of patients with newly diagnosed local-
ized prostate cancer enrolled throughout North Carolina in
collaborationwiththeRapidCaseAscertainmentsystemofthe
North Carolina Central Cancer Registry. The Rapid Case As-
certainment system proactively identified patients with newly
diagnosed prostate cancer from all 100 North Carolina coun-
ties from January 1, 2011, through June 30, 2013. Names of pa-
tients, pathologic and diagnostic information, and physician
names and addresses were sent weekly to the Rapid Case As-
certainment staff by tumor registrars at local hospitals. The pa-
tients were then approached by the NC ProCESS staff for study
participation; 1419 (57.2%) of 2480 eligible patients agreed to
enroll. All patients were enrolled before treatment and fol-
lowed up prospectively to collect data from medical records
and patient-reported outcomes. For each patient, primary care
physician and urologist records, as well as radiation oncolo-
gist records if consulted, were obtained. Individual-level so-
ciodemographic information (race, marital status, educa-
tionallevel,income)wascollectedbypatientreport.Thisstudy
was approved by the University of North Carolina Institu-
tionalReviewBoard,includingconsenttoobtainrecords.Writ-
ten informed consent was obtained from all patients, and data
were deidentified for analysis.
Outcome Measures
This study included 881 patients enrolled in the NC ProCESS.
Data were collected on the following 20 comorbid condi-
tions: myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, periph-
eral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic ob-
structivepulmonarydisease,pepticulcerdisease,liverdisease,
diabetes, kidney disease, other cancers, human immunode-
ficiency virus or AIDS, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia,
clotting disorders, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, inflamma-
tory bowel disease, asthma, anemia and other blood disor-
ders, and arthritis. These conditions are included in the most
commonly used comorbidity indexes in cancer research, in-
cluding the Charlson Comorbidity Index,15,16 Adult Comorbid-
ity Evaluation Index,17 Index of Co-Existent Diseases,16 and
Kaplan-Feinstein Comorbidity Index.18,19 The conditions were
assessedbypatientreportviatelephonesurvey(“Haveyouever
beentoldbyadoctororotherhealthprofessionalthatyouhave
[comorbid condition]?”) and by medical record abstraction at
the time of study enrollment, which was always before treat-
ment. Telephone surveys were conducted by the Carolina Sur-
vey Research Laboratory at the University of North Carolina,
and staff followed the above script to elicit comorbidity infor-
mation. In addition, medical records were abstracted for the
presence of these comorbidities.
Key Points
Question Do medical records and patient reports on the presence
or absence of comorbid conditions agree in patients with newly
diagnosed prostate cancer?
Findings In this population-based and diverse cohort of 881
patients, comorbidities were prevalent, and patient reports and
medical records for most medical conditions agreed in more than
90% of patients.
Meaning Patient reporting provides information similar to
medical record abstraction and may be a less costly method for
assessing comorbid conditions for observational comparative
effectiveness research.

 Statistical Analysis
We describe the presence of each condition based on patient
report, medical record abstraction, both, or neither; κ statis-
tics were used to quantify the level of agreement between pa-
tient report and medical records. The κ statistic is a way of re-
portingagreementbetween2informationsourcesbyproviding
a quantitative measurement of the interobserver agreement
magnitude, accounting for chance agreement.20 This is stan-
dardized to fit a scale of −1 to 1; 0 represents the amount of ex-
pected agreement by chance alone, whereas 1 is perfect
agreement.20 Data from patients who did not respond to the
telephonesurvey(11of881patients[1.2%])orreportedthatthey
were unsure whether they had a condition (affecting ≥1 comor-
bid conditions in 15 of 881 patients [1.7%]) were excluded from
analysis. Landis and Koch thresholds were used to classify
agreementlevelsaspoororslight(<0.20),fair(≥0.20to<0.40),
moderate (≥0.40 to <0.60), substantial (≥0.60 to <0.80), or al-
mostperfect(≥0.80).21Weperformedsubgroupanalysestode-
termine whether the κ statistic varied by age, race, educa-
tional level, income, or cancer aggressiveness (defined by
prostate cancer risk group).22 We then performed logistic re-
gression to assess covariates associated with agreement be-
tween patient report and medical records, with separate mod-
els for each comorbidity. The subgroup and multivariable
analyses inform our understanding of whether certain sub-
groups of patients with prostate cancer have higher or lower
agreementintermsofthepresenceofcomorbidconditionsfrom

SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
A total of 881 patients were analyzed (median age, 65 years;
age range, 41-80 years). This cohort was sociodemographi-
cally diverse, with 633 white participants (71.9%) and 248 non-
white participants (28.1%), 281 (31.9%) with high school edu-
cation or less, and 322 (36.5%) with household income of
$40 000 or less. Baseline characteristics are given in Table 1.
Table 2 gives the frequency of patient and physician re-
porting of each comorbid condition, level of agreement, and
κ statistics. We found agreement between patient reports and
medical records in more than 90% of patients for all condi-
tions, except coronary artery disease (87%), arrhythmia (86%),
hypertension(85%),hyperlipidemia(68%),andarthritis(66%).
When assessed using the κ statistic, agreement was substan-
tial or almost perfect for myocardial infarction (κ = 0.62), cere-
brovascular disease (κ = 0.72), diabetes (κ = 0.90), human im-
munodeficiency virus or AIDS (κ = 1.00), and hypertension
(κ = 0.68), whereas agreement was lower for the other condi-
tions. When there was disagreement, both scenarios (medi-
cal records indicating condition not reported by patients and
patient indicating presence of condition not indicated in medi-
cal records) were observed. For cerebrovascular disease,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, coronary ar-
tery disease, and hypertension, medical records were more
likely to report the condition than patients, whereas for myo-
cardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peptic ulcer dis-
ease, kidney disease, other cancers, arrhythmia, clotting dis-
orders, hyperlipidemia, asthma, anemia and other blood
disorders, and arthritis, patients were more likely to indicate
the condition.
Subgroup analysis for the κ statistic based on age, race,
marital status, educational level, income, and prostate can-
cer risk groups for each comorbidity is given in Table 3. The κ
statistics differed by patient race in 7 conditions: white pa-
tients had higher κ statistics in chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, liver disease, cancers other than prostate, and
coronaryarterydisease,whereasnonwhitepatientshadhigher
κ statistics in congestive heart failure, clotting disorders, and
inflammatory bowel disease. The κ statistics also differed by
educational level in 4 conditions: patients with a high school
education or less had higher κ statistics in kidney disease, clot-
ting disorders, and anemia and other blood disorders, whereas
those with more than a high school education had a higher κ
statistic in inflammatory bowel disease.
In multivariable logistic regression (Table 4), older age was
associated with lower overall agreement in multiple condi-
tions:olderthan70yearscomparedwithyoungerthan60years
was associated with lower overall agreement for myocardial
infarction (odds ratio [OR], 0.31; 95% CI, 0.12-0.80), cerebro-
vascular disease (OR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.01-0.78), kidney dis-
ease (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.06-0.52), coronary artery disease
(OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.20-0.67), and arrhythmia (OR, 0.44; 95%
CI, 0.25-0.79); age between 60 and 69 years compared with

Discussion
In this study of 881 patients with prostate cancer from a di-
verse, population-based cohort, we examined the agreement
between patient report and medical record documentation for
20 comorbid conditions commonly included in comorbidity
indexes used in cancer research. In 16 of these conditions, we
found agreement between patient report and medical record
documentation in more than 90% of patients, whereas agree-
ment was notably lower for hyperlipidemia and arthritis. On
multivariable analysis, older age was significantly associated
with lower overall agreement for multiple cardiovascular con-
ditions and kidney disease. Our hypothesis that nonwhite race
and lower educational level would be associated with lower
patient vs physician report agreement was mostly incorrect.
Accurate assessment of comorbidities is important be-
cause prostate cancer treatment decision making is directly af-
fectedbyapatient’
sbaselinecomorbiditystatus.1,2IntheUnited
States,youngerandhealthierpatientscommonlyundergopros-
tatectomy, whereas older patients and those with more comor-
bidconditionsreceiveradiationorconservativemanagement.19
Comparative effectiveness research for localized prostate can-
cer treatment options is a high-priority research area10; given
clinical patient selection into different treatment groups, ob-
servational studies must accurately account for a patient’
s co-
morbidities to reach valid conclusions. Because a patient’
s co-
morbid conditions directly affect survival2 and quality of life,11
a better understanding of how to assess comorbidity informa-
tion addresses one of the most important methodologic is-
sues in comparative effectiveness research.
Our study is novel because, to our knowledge, no prior
studies have directly compared patient and physician report
of comorbidities specifically in patients with prostate cancer.
Both sources of information are used in different prostate can-
cer studies to account for comorbidities,23-27 yet we do not
know whether patient reports and medical records provide the
same information. A report23 from the Prostate Cancer Out-
comes Study, which in a population-based cohort of patients
enrolled in 1994 collected patient-reported comorbidity in-
formation serially, found that patient reports of comorbid con-
ditions were consistent over time; however, the study did not
provide detailed data on how patient reports compared with
medicalrecords.AnotherstudypublishedbyKatzetal12in1996
of 170 hospitalized patients compared patient reports and hos-
pital records. For conditions studied that overlap with our
study, the κ statistics were similar to our findings for myocar-
dialinfarction,congestiveheartfailure,peripheralvasculardis-
ease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, and peptic ulcer disease, whereas they differed

 by more than 0.20 for diabetes, kidney disease, and other
cancers.12 We also found several other studies28-30 that exam-
ined concordance between medical records and patient re-
ports. However, these studies did not specifically include pa-
tients with cancer, were conducted in settings that were not
real world (inpatient, Veterans Affairs ambulatory care, or pa-
tientswithspecifichealthplans),anddidnotexaminewhether
agreement differed by patient subgroups.
Given the lack of prior data, results from this study pro-
vide important information on a central methodologic issue in
observational comparative effectiveness research: to accu-
rately account for potential differences in patient characteris-
tics across comparison groups. Assessing comorbid medical
conditions using patient report is a less expensive option than
medical record abstraction. Our results suggest that patient re-
port provides information similar to medical records for most
comorbidities studied, and there is no consistent pattern of
higherorloweragreementbyraceoreducationallevel,butthere
was a lower κ statistic in older patients for several, mostly car-
diovascular, conditions, which are especially likely to affect
older individuals. One potential explanation is that older pa-
tients are more likely to have more comorbidities,5 and as the
number of comorbidities increases, precision between medi-
cal record and patient report decreases. In addition, older pa-
tients may have lower health literacy, which may have contrib-
uted to the lower agreement. However, additional research is
needed to further examine measurement of cardiovascular co-
morbidities in older patients with cancer. Because the NC
ProCESS obtains longer-term follow-up in these patients, we
will be able to assess whether patient report, medical records,
or both best predict survival and quality-of-life outcomes.
There is an established literature on patient-reported out-
comes that has consistently found discordance between pa-
tient report vs physician report in cancer treatment–related ad-
verseeffectsandhealth-relatedqualityoflife.31-33Patientstend
to report these symptoms earlier and more frequently than do
physicians,32 and this research has led to a common accep-
tance of patient-reported outcomes as a valid measure in clini-
caltrials.Thematically,thesepriorstudies31-33provideaframe-
work for interpreting results from this study: indeed, there are
modest discrepancies between patient and physician report-
ing of comorbid conditions. In this study, we obtained and ab-
stracted medical records from the primary care physician and
cancerspecialistsbecausethespecialistsneedtoaccuratelycol-
lectcomorbidityinformationfortreatmentdecisionmakingand
the primary care physician would be expected to know and

port the recent standard set defined by an international group
of experts regarding data that should be collected for all pa-
tients with localized prostate cancer, including comorbidities
using patient report instead of medical record abstraction.34
Strengths and Limitations
This study contains multiple methodologic strengths. The NC
ProCESS cohort is large and population based, and the rich
diversity of enrolled patients allowed for subgroup analyses
to examine agreement by age, race, educational level, and
other factors. The cohort is modern, with all patients enrolled
from 2011 to 2013. Enrollment of patients from the commu-
nity setting also provides information that is reflective and
generalizable to real-world patients and medical care. In
addition, patient-reported comorbidity information and
medical records were obtained before prostate cancer treat-
ment, which avoids potential confounding from conditions
developed after (or potentially because of) treatment. On the
other hand, in our literature search, we found no existing
data on what constitutes a meaningful difference in κ statis-
tic. In Table 3 (subgroup analysis), we highlighted differences
of 0.20 or greater to help the reader more easily identify sub-
groups with sizable differences in agreement,21 and the
actual values are provided to allow readers to make their own
conclusions.
One limitation of the study is that we did not examine
whetherdifferentsourcesofmedicalrecords(academicvscom-
munity, primary care physician vs specialist) differed in in-
formation accuracy. The issue of accuracy in comorbidity re-
porting is difficult to assess; when medical records and patient
reports differ, it is unclear who is right. Conditions listed in the
medical record may be incorrect if they are assumptions based
on a patient’
s medication list or errors that continue to propa-
gate over time. Another limitation of the study is that we were
unable to compare calculated comorbidity scores (eg, Charl-
son Comorbidity Index) between medical records and pa-
tient report, which are commonly used in comparative effec-
tiveness studies, because of a lack of certain specific details
required for score calculation. However, because there was
overall high agreement in most comorbid conditions exam-
ined, we hypothesize that calculated comorbidity scores will
be similar between medical records and patient report, which
will need to be confirmed in future studies.
Conclusions
In a population-based cohort of patients with newly diag-
nosed prostate cancer, agreement between patient and phy-
sician reporting occurred in more than 90% of patients for 16
of 20 assessed comorbid conditions. This is the first large-
scale study, to our knowledge, to specifically examine infor-
mation source in comorbidity reporting, a central issue in ob-
servationalcomparativeeffectivenessresearch.Overall,patient
reporting provides information similar to medical record ab-
straction,withoutsignificantdifferencesbypatientraceoredu-
cational level. However, assessment of cardiovascular condi-
tions in older patients requires further study.
