IMPORTANCE The patient-to-intensivist ratio (PIR) across intensive care units (ICUs) is not
standardized and the association of PIR with patient outcome is not well established.
Understanding the impact of PIR on outcomes is necessary to optimize senior medical
staffing and deliver high-quality care.
OBJECTIVE To test the hypotheses that: (1) there is significant variation in the PIR across ICUs
and (2) higher PIRs are associated with higher hospital mortality for ICU patients.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort analysis of patients (�16 years)
admitted to ICUs staffed by a single intensivist during daytime hours in the United Kingdom
from 2010 to 2013.
EXPOSURES Patient-to-intensivist ratios, which we defined for each patient as the number of
patients cared for by the intensivist each day averaged over the patient’
s stay.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Using standard summary statistics, we evaluated PIR
variation across ICUs. We used multivariable, mixed-effect, logistic regression analysis to
evaluate the association between PIR and hospital mortality at ultimate discharge from acute
hospital (primary outcome) and at ICU discharge.
FINDING Among 49 686 adults in 94 ICUs, median age was 66 (interquartile range [IQR],
52-76) years, and 45.1% were women. The ultimate hospital mortality was 25.7%. The median
PIR for patients was 8.5 (IQR, 6.9-10.8; full range, 1.0-23.5), and varied substantially among
individual ICUs. The association between PIR and ultimate hospital mortality was U-shaped;
there was a reduction in the odds of mortality associated with an increasing PIR up to 7.5 after
which the odds of mortality increased again significantly (average patient mortality for lowest
PIR, 22%; PIR of 7.5, 15%; highest PIR, 19%; P = .003). A similar U-shaped association was
seen for PIR and mortality in the ICU (nadir of mortality at a PIR of 7.8, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE PIR varied across UK ICUs. The optimal PIR in this cohort of
UK ICU patients was 7.5, with significantly increased ICU and hospital mortality above and
below this ratio. The number of patients cared for by 1 intensivist may impact patient
outcomes.

riticallyillpatientsrequirecomplexcareandmoststud-
ies indicate that senior critical care doctors (intensiv-
ists) improve intensive care unit (ICU) patient
outcomes.1,2 For this reason, recommendations from the In-
tensive Care Society in the United Kingdom (UK),3 as well as
the Society for Critical Care Medicine4 and external bodies5 in
the US, call for higher intensity intensivist staffing. In addi-
tion, the number of ICU beds in the UK and US has been
increasing.6 Without increased intensivist supply, these trends
requireincreasingpatient-to-intensivistratios(PIRs).Whilewe
knowcriticalcareisbestdeliveredbyamultidisciplinaryteam,7
it is unclear how many patients may be appropriately cared for
by a single intensivist.
To date, little is known about whether ICU patient out-
comes are affected by the PIR. The only research study8 di-
rectly evaluating this relationship—in which ICU bed-to-
intensivistratios(whetherornotthebedwasoccupied)ranged
from 7.5 to 15—found that higher ratios were associated with
longer ICU length of stay (LOS) for patients but there was no
association with ICU or hospital mortality. This study, how-
ever, was conducted in a single center using historical con-
trols. Using data from UK ICUs, we performed a multicenter,
retrospective analysis to test the hypotheses that: (1) there is
significant variation in the PIR across ICUs and (2) higher PIRs
are associated with higher hospital mortality for ICU pa-
tients.
Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data on ad-
missions to adult general critical care units in the United King-
dom participating in the Intensive Care National Audit and Re-
search Centre (ICNARC) Case Mix Programme (CMP), linked
with data from 2 staffing surveys. We used answers to 2 dif-
ferent questions, 1 from each staffing survey. The first was the
United Kingdom Consultant Cover Census study (UK-3Cs),9
conducted in 2011, in which was asked “open vs closed ICU?”
andthesecondwasasinglequestionsurveytoICUsintheCMP,
conducted in 2013, in which was asked, “On weekdays, dur-
ing daytime hours, is 1 or more intensive care consultants re-
sponsible for all patients in the unit?” Daytime hours were de-
finedas8:00 AMto3:59 PMpurposelytoincludehoursinwhich
primary intensivists are most likely to be physically present
in the ICU. The answers from both surveys were assumed to
apply for the full duration of this study, when more than 1 in-
tensivist was responsible for daytime weekday care of ICU pa-
tients, the exact number was queried.
Institutional review board exemption was obtained from
Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Approval for the collec-
tion and use of patient identifiable data in the CMP was ob-
tained under Section 251 of the National Health Service Act of
2006.
Cohort
The cohort included participating ICUs from January 1, 2010,
through December 31, 2013. We excluded ICUs with incom-
plete staffing survey responses, those reporting more than 1
intensivist during daytime hours, and those that did not have
a closed-model of intensivist staffing (because accurate PIRs
could not be assessed). Patients in included ICUs were those
admitted during daytime hours because: (1) primary intensiv-
ists may not be actively involved in after-hours admissions and
(2) daytime workload is unlikely to impact intensivists’abil-
ity to care for a new admission presenting after-hours. Pa-
tients were excluded if they were younger than 16 years (be-
cause adult and pediatric critical illnesses differ and may be
differently affected by PIR). Only the first ICU admission in the
hospital stay was included (to avoid double counting of hos-
pital deaths).
Exposure of Interest: PIR
For the primary analysis, we calculated the PIR for a given pa-
tient as the total number of patients cared for by the intensiv-
ist for all or any portion of daytime hours, averaged over the
patient’
s ICU stay. For example, if 10 patients were in the ICU
at 8:00 AM, of whom 2 were discharged prior to 3:59 PM and 3
new patients were admitted during the daytime (8:00 AM-
3:59 PM), the PIR would be 13 (the initial 10 plus the 3 admit-
ted) for that day. All patients, including readmissions, were in-
cluded for this calculation. This definition aimed to reflect the
averageoverallpatientworkloadfortheintensivist,duringday-
time hours, over the duration of stay for a given patient.
In sensitivity analyses, we used 9 alternative calculations
of PIR because it was not apparent which ones may affect pa-
tient outcome: (1) total number of patients in the ICU during
daytime hours on the day of admission; number of new pa-
tients during daytime hours (2) averaged over the ICU stay and
(3) on the day of admission; average level of care for all pa-
tients in the ICU (4) averaged over the ICU stay and (5) on the
day of admission; average severity of illness for all patients in
the ICU (6) averaged over the ICU stay and (7) on the day of
admission; and the number of patients cared for during the
daily rounding period of 8:00 AM to 10:59 AM (8) averaged over
the ICU stay and (9) on the day of admission. Level of care was
defined by the Critical Care Minimum Data Set and recorded
as: 0, needs normal ward care; 1, needs acute ward care with
support from a critical care team; 2, needs more detailed ob-
servation and/or intervention; and 3, needs advanced respi-
ratory support and/or 2 or more organs supported.10 Severity
of illness was estimated as the probability of hospital mortal-
Key Points
Question What is the association of patient-to-intensivist ratio
with hospital mortality for intensive care unit patients?
Findings In this retrospective cohort analysis including 49 686
adults in 94 United Kingdom intensive care units, a
patient-to-intensivist ratio of 7.5 was associated with the lowest
risk adjusted hospital mortality, with higher mortality at both
higher and lower patient-to-intensivist ratios.
Meaning Intensivist staffing should ensure that patient volume is
sufficient for proficiency in care, but allows for sufficient time and
care to be taken with each patient to minimize harm.

ity derived from the ICNARC risk prediction model (2013
recalibration).11
Patient-, ICU-, and Hospital-Level Data
Patient data included demographics (age, sex); long-term
healthstatus(comorbidities—codedindividuallyasseveredys-
function of each of 7 organ systems); functional status (deter-
mined by degree of assistance needed with activities of daily
living); and details of the acute illness (medical—not admit-
ted directly following surgery—vs surgical, first 24-hour prob-
ability of hospital mortality from the ICNARC model,11 num-
ber of organ dysfunctions in the first 24 hours, highest level
of care over the first 24 hours, use of advanced respiratory sup-
port[invasivemechanicalventilationand/orextracorporeallife
support] during ICU stay, average level of care during ICU stay,
and whether treatments were withheld or withdrawn during
ICU stay). Intensive care unit and hospital data included num-
ber of ICU beds and reported hospital type (nonuniversity, uni-
versity,university-affiliated).Noinformationwasavailableper-
taining to nonintensivist physician or nonphysician staffing
during daytime hours.
Outcomes
All patients were followed up to ultimate discharge from acute
hospital whether this discharge was from the original ICU and
acute hospital (housing the ICU) or from a subsequent ICU
and/or acute hospital to which the patient was transferred. The
primary outcome for this analysis was ultimate hospital mor-
tality. Secondary outcomes included ultimate ICU mortality,
original ICU mortality, and original hospital mortality (from
original acute hospital housing original ICU).
Statistical Analyses
Baseline characteristics and unadjusted outcomes for the co-
hort were tabulated using standard summary statistics. PIRs
across ICUs were evaluated using median, interquartile ranges
(IQR), and full ranges. We compared PIRs across predefined
subgroups (medical vs surgical, highest level of care over the
first 24 hours, number of ICU beds, and hospital type) using
the Kruskal-Wallis equality-of-populations rank test.
We used multivariable, mixed-effect logistic regression to
assess the association of patient-level PIR and mortality. All
listed patient, ICU, and hospital variables were included as co-
variates with clustering within ICUs, except ICU bed number
owing to collinearity with PIR. The PIR was modeled using re-
stricted cubic splines with 4 knots to allow for possible non-
linear associations.12,13 Models were restricted to patients with
data available for all covariates. To display model results, we
plotted curves that depict the effect on mortality for an aver-
age patient—defined as having the average of all non-patient-
to-intensivist ratio covariates—as a function of patient-to-
intensivist ratio. To address the possibility of overfitting, we
repeatedourprimaryanalysesacross20bootstrappedsamples
with random sampling at the level of the individual ICU.14
As a first sensitivity analysis, we repeated modeling using
theninealternatedefinitionsofPIR(describedabove).Asasec-
ond sensitivity analysis, assessed post hoc because larger ICUs
tended to have higher PIRs, we performed stratified analyses
by ICU size using both tertiles of bed number and specific bed
numbers to assess whether observed associations between PIR
and hospital mortality were independent of ICU size. As a third
post hoc sensitivity analysis, we analyzed (separately) the ICUs
and patients excluded from our primary analysis where mul-
tiple intensivists cared for patients during daytime hours. The
PIRs for these ICUs were calculated assuming patients were
evenly divided among the daytime intensivists; this allowed
us to evaluate PIRs similar to our primary analysis but for ICUs
of larger size (thus, separating PIR from ICU size). We limited
this sensitivity analysis, post hoc, to patients with a PIR of 10
or less to avoid skewing of the results by high PIR outliers.
Theselatter2analyseswereconductedtoaddresspossiblecon-
founding by ICU size given the tight correlation between PIR
and ICU size.
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata statisti-
cal software (version 13, Statacorp) and Microsoft Excel (2013,
Microsoft). P values less than .05 were considered signifi-
cant.
Results
The primary cohort included 49 686 adults admitted be-
tween January 2010 and December 2013 to 94 ICUs (eFigure 1
in the Supplement). The 94 ICUs had a median of 10 (inter-
quartile range [IQR], 8-13) beds (Table) (eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment). Median age of patients was 66 (IQR, 52-76) years and
45.1% were women. A minority had a very severe comorbid-
ity (19.3%) and/or reported requiring some functional assis-
tance prior to hospitalization (25.0%). Most were admitted for
medicalreasons(62.1%),predominantlywithconditionsofthe
respiratory, gastrointestinal, or cardiovascular system. Mean
(SD) predicted risk of hospital mortality was 24.1% (26.8%) and
the median was 12.2% (IQR, 2.7%-39.1%). Of 49 686 patients,
46.2% received level 3 care within the first 24 hours in ICU and
43.8% received advanced respiratory support during their ICU
stay. Median LOS in the original ICU was 2.2 (IQR, 1.1-5.0) days
and ultimate hospital mortality was 25.7%.
PIRs
The median PIR for the primary cohort was 8.5 (IQR, 6.9-
10.8; range, 1.0-23.5). Median PIRs varied substantially
across individual ICUs (Figure 1). At the extremes, a
4-bedded ICU had a median PIR of 2.0 (IQR, 1.5-2.7) and a
20-bedded ICU had a median PIR of 19.0 (IQR, 18.0-19.9).
Median PIRs were systematically higher in larger ICUs
(P < .001) and differed significantly by type of hospital
(Figure 2). Median PIR was lower for patients with lower
levels of care at ICU admission (P < .001). Median PIR values
for medical (8.5; IQR, 6.9-11.0) and surgical (8.5; IQR, 6.9-
10.7) patients were similar (P = .05).
Association of PIR With Outcomes
After multivariable adjustment, the PIR for each patient was
significantly associated with ultimate hospital mortality
(P = .003) (Figure 3). This relationship was U-shaped with
the lowest mortality at a nadir PIR of 7.5 and significantly

higher mortality when the PIR was lower or higher than this
value. A similar association was seen in the majority of the
20 bootstrapped samples. Similar U-shaped associations
were seen for PIR with our other prespecified mortality out-
comes: ultimate ICU mortality (nadir PIR of 7.8; P < .001);
original ICU mortality (nadir PIR of 7.8; P < .001); original
hospital mortality (nadir PIR of 7.6; P = .006) (eFigure 2 in

vealed varying associations with ultimate hospital mortality.
Mortality increased monotonically and significantly with PIR
defined as the number of new admissions (during daytime
hours, Figure 4A; during the daily rounding period, Figure 4D).
Significant U-shaped associations were seen with PIR de-
fined as average severity of illness of all patients in the ICU av-
eraged over the ICU stay of the index patient (Figure 4B) and
as the number of patients in the ICU during the daily round-
ing period (Figure 4C). Definitions of PIR defined by work-
load on the day of a patient’
s admission were not signifi-

Post hoc sensitivity analyses indicated that the PIR-

(eTable 2, eFigures 4 and 5 in the Supplement). Smaller ICUs
had significant U-shaped associations but, as ICUs increased
in size, the association was nonsignificant or more complex

the nadir PIR was similar to that in the main analyses.

Discussion
Across UK ICUs, we demonstrated significant variation in the
average number of patients cared for by a single intensivist.
The PIR, calculated as the total number of patients cared for
by the intensivist for all or any portion of daytime hours av-
eraged over the patient’
s ICU stay, had a U-shaped associa-
tion with mortality until a PIR of 12 after which no associa-
tion was observed. The ultimate hospital mortality nadir
occurred at a PIR of 7.5 with higher mortality when the inten-
sivists’patient-load was either increased or decreased. We
found no association between mortality and the PIR when the
PIR was based on the intensivists’patient-load on the day of
a patient’
s admission or between PIR and mortality for larger
ICUs in our cohort. Several alternate definitions of PIR ac-
counting for a patient’
s full ICU stay did not reveal similar U-
shaped associations.
The association of lower PIRs with higher hospital mor-
tality may be explained by the volume-outcome relationship.
This construct characterizes a situation in which “practice
makes perfect”—the more frequently one does something
(higher volume), the more likely it is to be done well (better
outcome).Inarecentmeta-analysisofcriticallyillpatients,sig-
nificantly higher mortality was associated with being cared for
in lower-volume centers.15 By definition, individual intensiv-
ists who care for patients with lower PIRs are caring for fewer
patients. At an extreme, this may negatively impact the out-
come for these patients. Also, as seen in eTable 1 in the Supple-
ment, at lower PIRs intensivists are asked to take on respon-
sibilities outside the ICU that take them away from direct ICU
patient care and, thereby, may impact outcomes. Finally, the
abundance and experience of ancillary staff in very small ICUs
(thosemorelikelytohavepatientscaredforbyintensivistswith
low PIRs) may differ from that in larger units.
The association of higher hospital mortality with higher
PIRs may be explained by the fact that 1 intensivist only has a
set amount of time and energy to devote to his/her patients;
the more patients there are, the less attention each may re-
ceive. In a prospective study of allocation of time on rounds,
as the number of new patients increased, the time spent on
each patient, particularly new patients, decreased.16 In a study
ofUShospitalists,hospitalLOSandLOS-adjustedcostrosewith
an increasing patient-to-physician ratio; of note, at higher hos-
pital occupancy levels, the association of this ratio with hos-
pital LOS was U-shaped.17 Similar concerns exist for other
health care workers; in the US, California mandates maxi-
mum patient-to-nurse ratios in ICUs.18 We see a threshold ef-
fect at a PIR of approximately 12, after which further in-
creases in PIR are not associated with hospital mortality. While
this nonassociation may represent a truth—that above a cer-
tain PIR spreading an intensivist thinner makes no difference
to his/her patients’outcomes, care must be taken in interpret-
ing this result because only 17% of our cohort had PIRs greater
than 12. Moreover, it is possible that some higher PIR inten-
sivists have good patient outcomes, potentially as a result of
more ancillary staffing to offset their patient load and/or more
time to spend exclusively in the ICU without external respon-
sibilities.
Prior literature on the impact of PIRs in ICUs is limited. To
our knowledge, the only publication directly addressing this
question was a historically controlled observational study8
from the medical ICU at the Mayo Clinic. Over 2 years, the ICU
structure was sequentially altered and the bed-to-intensivist
ratio (similar to our patient-to-intensivist ratio) varied. While
neither the standardized ICU nor hospital mortality ratio was
associated with the bed-to-intensivist ratio, the observed/
predicted ICU LOS was highest with the highest (15 to 1) bed-
to-intensivist ratio.
Four other studies indirectly address this issue of the as-
sociation of PIR and outcomes. A multicenter study of US ICU
patients found no association of hospital death with ICU cen-
sus on each patient’
s day of admission.19 Whether 1 intensiv-
ist cared for all of the patients in the ICU, however, was not re-
ported. A survey20 of academic pulmonary and critical care
program directors in the United States estimated median cen-
sus for intensivists was 13 and respondents reported more time
constraints, more stress, and more difficulties teaching train-
ees when caring for more than 13 patients. An observational
study21 from 8 ICUs in 4 French university hospitals reported
that the adjusted risk of dying on a given shift was 2.0 times
higher (95% CI, 1.3-3.2) if the PIR was more than 14:1 vs less
than 8:1 on that shift. Finally, in a study9 also using data from
ICNARC CMP and UK-3Cs to look at UK ICUs, no association
was found between having more fulltime equivalent inten-
sivists on staff per ICU bed and hospital mortality. Because in
this study intensivist-to-bed ratio was quantified as the aver-
age over the study period, it likely did not fully capture the ex-
perience for each individual patient whose PIR may signifi-
cantly differ from the average. In addition, this measure of

sivist when caring for an individual patient.
The potential confounding of the observed association of
PIR with hospital and ICU mortality by ICU size is addressed
by our sensitivity analyses. In smaller units, with many pa-
tients with PIRs near 7.5, we see the same relationship as for
the full cohort. The relationship is lost in larger ICUs, how-
ever, where fewer patients have PIRs near 7.5; in this setting,
we have limited power to identify the initial descending limb
oftheU-shapedcurve.Also,ouranalysisoflargeICUswithmul-
tiple daytime intensivists allows for disentangling of ICU size
from PIR. Although not statistically significant, this analysis
demonstrates a similar U-shaped relationship of PIR and mor-
talitywithanadirvalueof7,closetothatforourprimaryanaly-
sis; these results suggest we are seeing a robust association of
outcome with PIR irrespective of ICU size. Finally, if the asso-
ciationwithmortalitywasdictatedsolelybyICUsize,wewould
expect that it would follow a strict volume-outcome relation-
ship—namely, that higher PIRs would be associated with bet-

The plotted curves depict the effect on mortality for an average patient
(defined as having the average of all non–patient-to-intensivist ratio covariates)
as a function of patient-to-intensivist ratio. Displayed are the alternate
patient-to-intensivist ratios with which there was a statistically significant
association with ultimate hospital mortality; all are using daily data averaged
over the index patient’
s ICU stay; there was no association found for patient
burden or severity of illness on the day of an index patient’
s ICU admission (see
eFigure 1 in the Supplement). Blue dashes indicate point estimates; light blue
bands, 95% CIs. A, Definition of patient-to-intensivist ratio is the number of
new patients in the unit daily from 8:00 AM to 3:59 PM averaged over the
patient’
s stay; there is an association between patient-to-intensivist ratio and
ultimate hospital mortality (P < .001); the association is not nonlinear (P = .02).
B, Definition of patient-to-intensivist ratio is the severity of illness by Intensive
Care National Audit and Research Centre (ICNARC) model of all patients in the
unit daily from 8:00 AM to 3:59 PM averaged over the patient’
s stay; there is an
association between patient-to-intensivist ratio and ultimate hospital mortality
(P < .001); and the association is nonlinear (P = .002); a similar association was
found when severity of illness was assessed by the average level of care for each
patient (rather than the ICNARC model). C, Definition of patient-to-intensivist
ratio is the total number of patients in the unit during daily rounding period
(8:00 AM-10:59 AM) averaged over the patient’
s stay; there is an association
between patient-to-intensivist ratio and ultimate hospital mortality (P < .001);
and the association is nonlinear (P < .001). D, Definition of patient-to-intensivist
ratio is the number of new patients in the unit during daily rounding period
(8:00 AM-10:59 AM) averaged over the patient’
s stay; given the data
distribution, this patient-to-intensivist ratio could not be modeled using
restricted cubic splines; there is an association (modeled as linear) between
patient-to-intensivist ratio and ultimate hospital mortality (P < .001).

ter outcomes across all PIR values. The fact that this is not the
case at higher PIRs suggests that other factors are at play—
namely, limits on time and mental-reserve which are felt by
physicians.
Ours is the first multicenter study to assess how outcomes
for critically ill patients are related specifically to the patient-
loadoftheintensivistscaringforthemthroughouttheirICUstay.
Its strengths include a large sample of patients and ICUs, de-
tailedclinicalandvalidatedseverityofillnessinformationavail-
able for each patient, and the wide variation in PIRs.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, critical care is a mul-
tidisciplinaryundertakingandcareteamsarecomposedofpro-
viders across many specialties and levels of training. We did
not have information on the particular composition of each pa-
tient’
s care team and it is likely that the impact of the inten-
sivist workload is affected by the presence of other staff
members.7 Our results must be interpreted as the impact of the
patient-to-intensivist led team ratio on mortality, therefore,
with recognition that team structure surely mediates this in-
teraction.
Second,thegeneralizabilityofourquantitativeresultsout-
side of the UK is likely limited. The precise nadir value for a
given context is likely influenced by numerous factors—
including intensivist training and experience, details of ICU
structure, staffing by other health care workers, and patient
type and severity—which can differ across ICUs and coun-
tries.Forexample,theUnitedKingdomhassubstantiallyfewer
ICU beds and admissions per capita than most of Western Eu-
ropeortheUnitedStates.22And(incomparisonwiththeUnited
States) UK ICU patients are younger, have greater physiologic
abnormalities, more frequently receive mechanical ventila-
tion, and have higher hospital mortality.23 This high severity
of illness of the patients in UK ICU beds may mean that the op-
timal PIR is lower than in other places that do not have such
high acuity of illness, but this remains speculative. Finally, our
aim was to understand the relationship of hospital mortality
with a simple measure of PIR rather than a more complex con-
struct of workload which may include patient volume, illness
severity, and patient turnover together. Assessing the associa-
tion of workload conceived in this way with outcomes will be
important to address in future studies.
Conclusions
In many regions, intensivists are perceived to be in short sup-
ply and the movement to have intensivists physically present
inICUsatalltimesfurtherstretchesavailablemanpower.24Our
findings indicate that caution is needed in designing intensiv-
ist staffing models in this supply-limited environment. While
our finding that the optimal PIR is 7.5 may not be generaliz-
able to non-UK ICUs, or ICUs with strong ancillary staffing or
senior trainees, the drivers of the association between PIR and
hospital mortality are likely universal; thus, the U-shaped re-
lationship we found is likely broadly applicable. Responding
to the increasing demand for ICU care by stretching available
intensivist resources ever thinner may be detrimental to pa-
tients. Conversely, having intensivists care for too few pa-
tients may also result in poor outcomes. While our analyses
cannotdemonstratecausalityandPIRmaybeamarkerofother
ICU staffing or structural differences that impact patient out-
comes, our results suggest there may be a “sweet spot” for the
PIR. Further study is needed to identify drivers (eg, ancillary
staffing) of the optimal PIR value across different critical care
settings and to investigate whether altering the PIR causes pa-
tient outcomes to change.
