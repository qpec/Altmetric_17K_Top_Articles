Abstract
Objectives—This study examines access to workplace accommodations for breastfeeding, as 
mandated by the Affordable Care Act, and its associations with breastfeeding initiation and 
duration. We hypothesize that women with access to reasonable break time and private space to 
express breast milk would be more likely to breastfeed exclusively at 6 months and to continue 
breastfeeding for a longer duration.
Methods—Data are from Listening to Mothers III, a national survey of women ages 18–45 who 
gave birth in 2011–2012. The study population included women who were employed full- or part-
time at the time of survey. Using two-way tabulation, logistic regression, and survival analysis, we 
characterized women with access to breastfeeding accommodations and assessed the associations 
between these accommodations and breastfeeding outcomes.
Results—Only 40% of women had access to both break time and private space. Women with 
both adequate break time and private space were 2.3 times (95% CI 1.03, 4.95) as likely to be 
breastfeeding exclusively at 6 months and 1.5 times (95% CI 1.08, 2.06) as likely to continue 
breastfeeding exclusively with each passing month compared to women without access to these 
accommodations.
Conclusions—Employed women face unique barriers to breastfeeding and have lower rates of 
breastfeeding initiation and shorter durations, despite compelling evidence of associated health 
benefits. Expanded access to workplace accommodations for breastfeeding will likely entail

 collaborative efforts between public health agencies, employers, insurers, and clinicians to ensure 
effective workplace policies and improved breastfeeding outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
Health benefits of breastfeeding for both infants and nursing mothers are well documented. 
Infants who are breastfed have better health outcomes, including lower rates of respiratory 
and gastrointestinal tract infections; sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS); allergic disease, 
including asthma; obesity; and type 1 diabetes, among other conditions (Ip et al., 2007; 
Eidelman et al., 2012). Women who breastfeed have a lower risk of developing postpartum 
depression, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and breast and ovarian cancers (Eidelman 
et al., 2012). Breastfeeding for longer periods and breastfeeding exclusively (breast milk 
only, without infant formula supplementation) are associated with greater health benefits 
(Eidelman et al., 2012).
Current public health and clinical guidelines recommend breastfeeding exclusively for 6 
months, with continued breastfeeding for 1 year or longer (Eidelman et al., 2012; World 
Health Organization, 2001); however, many women fall short of meeting these guidelines. 
In the United States, breastfeeding initiation has increased in recent years, with rates 
reaching 79% in 2011 (compared with 75% in 2008) (Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, 2012). Rates of breastfeeding exclusively through the first 6 months postpartum 
are also increasing but reached only 18.8% of births in 2011. (Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, 2013). Although breastfeeding initiation rates have increased, some Healthy 
People targets remain unmet for vulnerable subgroups of women, as are Healthy People 
2010 standards for breastfeeding exclusively (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
2012). In addition, many women do not meet their own personal goals for breastfeeding 
exclusively (Perrine, Scanlon, Li, Odom, & Grummer-Strawn, 2012). Subgroups of women 
facing barriers to breastfeeding include employed mothers, racial/ethnic minorities, and low-
income women (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007).
In addition to health effects, breastfeeding may have significant financial benefits to society. 
One cost study showed that if 90% of US women breastfed exclusively for 6 months, the 
nation would save $13 billion and prevent 911 deaths per year; most of these preventable 
deaths would occur among infants (Bartick & Reinhold, 2010). However, the economic 
effect of breastfeeding in the workplace is not generally captured in revenue flows, whereas 
the administrative and logistical challenges of providing workplace breastfeeding support 
are evident to employers and employees.
Over the past four decades, the labor force participation of US childbearing women has 
increased substantially. Two-thirds of women giving birth for the first time between 2006 
and 2008 reported working for an employer during their pregnancies. Nearly 60% of women 
employed during pregnancy had returned to work within 3 months, and 72% had returned to 
work 12 months postpartum (Laughlin, 2011). Prior research shows that prenatal 
employment has a negative effect on early exclusive breastfeeding (Attanasio, Kozhimannil, 
McGovern, Gjerdingen, & Johnson, 2013). Full-time maternal employment has been cited as 
a reason for early cessation of breastfeeding, and intention to return to work and full-time

 employment postpartum are associated with an increased risk of no breastfeeding (Fein & 
Roe, 1998; Hawkins, Griffiths, & Dezateux, 2007; Lindberg, 1996; Mandal, Roe, & Fein, 
2010; Ogbuanu, Glover, Probst, Hussey, & Liu, 2011; Ryan, Zhou, & Arensberg, 2006). In 
addition, there are well-documented sociodemographic disparities in breastfeeding, 
regardless of employment status. Non-Hispanic black women have lower breastfeeding rates 
than non-Hispanic white and Mexican American women (Li, Darling, Maurice, Barker, & 
Grummer-Strawn, 2005). Rates of breastfeeding initiation are lower among low-income 
women, particularly those who are younger, unmarried, or have no college education 
(Ahluwalia, Morrow, & Hsia, 2005; Khoury, Moazzem, Jarjoura, Carothers, & Hinton, 
2005). Low-income women may have a particularly difficult time managing both 
breastfeeding and employment because of their specific employment circumstances, such as 
hourly employment with limited break time, a lack of facilities for pumping and storing 
breast milk, service industry work requiring continuous customer contact, or limited support 
from employers or coworkers (Committee on Healthcare for Underserved Women, 2013; 
Kimbro, 2006).
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010 includes workplace-related provisions to address 
breastfeeding barriers among employed women ("Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Act," 2010). Section 4207 of the ACA amends the Fair Labor Standards Act and applies to 
all employees who are non-exempt from Section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act, 
including employees working for companies engaged in interstate commerce whose total 
annual sales exceed $500,000, health care facilities, schools, or public agencies. The 
amendment, which took effect when the ACA was signed on March 23, 2010, requires 
employers to provide reasonable break time and a private place, other than a bathroom, for 
breastfeeding mothers to use a breast pump to express their breast milk during the workday 
for at least 1 year postpartum ("Reasonable break time for working mothers," 2011). 
Employers with fewer than 50 employees can file for exemption if they prove that providing 
these accommodations poses undue hardship ("Reasonable break time for working mothers," 
2011). The absence of such requirements has been noted previously as a substantial obstacle 
to breastfeeding (Shealy, Li, Benton-Davis, & Grummer-Strawn, 2005; United States 
Breastfeeding Committee, 2010). These provisions are expected to be particularly beneficial 
for women who have faced heightened barriers to breastfeeding (Drago, Hayes, & Yi, 2010). 
However, no studies of access to these supportive practices among employed women have 
been conducted since the ACA was passed.
The goal of this study is twofold: (1) to characterize the women who have access to 
breastfeeding accommodations in the workplace; and (2) to examine the association between 
these accommodations and breastfeeding outcomes, including any breastfeeding and 
breastfeeding exclusively at 6 months postpartum and overall breastfeeding duration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data and Study Sample
We analyzed data from the Listening to Mothers III survey, commissioned by Childbirth 
Connection and conducted online by Harris Interactive. The core survey, administered 
between October and December 2012, contained responses from a national sample of 2,400

 women who gave birth in US hospitals between July 2011 and June 2012. A follow-up 
postpartum survey, conducted January through April 2013 among the same sample, had 
1,072 respondents. Harris Interactive used a survey methodology in which eligible 
participants were recruited from a national panel. Harris Interactive also weighted the data 
(based on demographics and access to the internet) to ensure that the group of respondents 
was nationally-representative. Information about the Listening to Mothers III survey is 
available on the survey website (www.childbirthconnection.org/listeningtomothers/). In 
addition to data on women’s pregnancy and intrapartum experiences, the survey captured 
several unique breastfeeding-related measures. The surveys contained information on 
workplace accommodations for nursing mothers and past breastfeeding experiences, as well 
as important sociodemographic factors such as marital status, education, insurance coverage, 
and family income. Researchers have used data from earlier Listening to Mothers surveys to 
successfully analyze various maternity-related issues including breastfeeding, but this is the 
first examination of access to and effects of workplace-based breastfeeding support 
(Attanasio et al., 2013; Declercq, Labbok, Sakala, & O'Hara, 2009).
The sample for this analysis included respondents who affirmed employment at the time of 
the postpartum survey (N=550). Further survey questions identified full- or part-time work, 
and whether self-employed or working for an employer. The survey did not collect 
information on firm size. This study was exempted from IRB review by the University of 
Minnesota IRB (study number 1011E92983).
Measurement of Variables
Measures of workplace accommodations were based on 2 questions asking, "Did your 
employer provide…?" 1) “Reasonable breaks to allow nursing mothers to express breast 
milk,” and 2) “A private place that is not a bathroom where nursing mothers can express 
breast milk.” Answer choices included "Yes," "No," and "Not sure."
Breastfeeding variables included breastfeeding status at 1 week and 6 months postpartum 
(any/exclusive) and breastfeeding duration (months). All respondents were asked whether 
they were currently feeding their child breast milk and/or formula. Women were also asked 
how many months they breastfed exclusively and when they stopped feeding their baby 
breast milk. The analysis also included indicators for women to report whether (1) their 
employment plans affected their breastfeeding decisions; (2) breastfeeding was a major or 
minor problem associated with return to work; and (3) respondents faced any breastfeeding 
challenges in the first 2 months postpartum, including sore nipples, breast infection, or other 
breastfeeding problems.
Additional covariates included age; race/ethnicity; education; marital status; census region; 
income; prenatal participation in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC); delivery mode (vaginal or cesarean); neonatal intensive care 
(NICU) stay; low birth weight (<2,500 grams); and whether breastfeeding intentions were 
met in previous births. Breastfeeding intentions in previous births was coded as a 
dichotomous (0/1) variable indicating whether women did not meet previous intentions; 
respondents who had met previous breastfeeding intentions as well as those who were first-
time mothers (with no previous breastfeeding experience) had a value of 0 for this variable.

 Analysis
We examined bivariate associations between sociodemographic and birth-related 
characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, Census region, income, 
participation in the WIC program, delivery mode, prior breastfeeding experiences, NICU 
status, preterm birth, and low birth weight) and access to (1) adequate break time, (2) private 
space, or (3) both accommodations. We also performed cross-tabulations and χ2 tests to 
assess associations between workplace accommodations and breastfeeding challenges, 
intentions, and outcomes. We then used multivariable logistic regression models to predict 
the likelihood of each workplace accommodation.
To examine breastfeeding outcomes, we used multinomial logistic regression models to 
predict the likelihood of any breastfeeding and breastfeeding exclusively at 6 months 
postpartum by workplace accommodation, as well as Cox proportional hazards models – 
which were tested for violation of the proportional hazards assumption – to estimate the 
likelihood of continuing breastfeeding each month. We controlled all models for 
sociodemographic and birth-related covariates described above. Results were robust to 
alternate, more parsimonious, model specifications that included only significant predictors 
of workplace accommodations and more limited sets of predictor variables. We performed 
all analyses using Stata 12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the characteristics of women in the study sample, both overall and by access 
to each type of workplace accommodation. Of the 550 women included, 59% reported 
having access to reasonable break time to express milk, 45% had access to a private space, 
and 40% had both break time and private space. Respondents were predominantly non-
Hispanic white and married. More than one-third (36%) of respondents participated in the 
WIC program during their pregnancy, and 41% reported not having met their breastfeeding 
intentions during a previous birth. This demographic profile reflects the national population 
of childbearing women (Martin, Hamilton, Ventura, Osterman, & Matthews, 2013). 
Significantly more women with higher incomes reported having access to break time, 
private space, and both accommodations (P<.001 for all comparisons). Similarly, women 
who participated in WIC had significantly less access to break time (P=.001) and both 
accommodations (P=.036). Women with lower levels of education and those who did not 
meet breastfeeding intentions in prior births had less access to private space and both 
accommodations, and married women had more access to both accommodations (P<.05 for 
all comparisons).
Bivariate associations between workplace accommodations and breastfeeding challenges, 
intentions, and outcomes are shown in Table 2. Nearly 60% of women reported 
breastfeeding as a major or minor problem associated with return to work during the first 2 
months postpartum. Nearly 50% reported that their postpartum employment plans affected 
breastfeeding-related decisions, and 33% indicated that employment posed a challenge to 
breastfeeding. In unadjusted comparisons, significantly more women who intended to 
breastfeed exclusively reported having sufficient break time, although this may have been a 
function of higher education and income levels. Fewer women who were not breastfeeding

 at either 1 week (P=.010) or 6 months postpartum (P=.030) reported having access to 
sufficient break time.
Table 3 shows the adjusted, predicted odds of having each accommodation type by 
sociodemographic and birth-related characteristics. As suggested earlier in Table 1, income 
and WIC participation were significant predictors of access to accommodations despite 
controlling for other covariates. Specifically, women with household incomes from $52301 
to $102000 were more than twice as likely as women with incomes of $52300 or less to 
have access to break time, private space, and both accommodations, whereas women with 
incomes exceeding $102001 were more than 3 times as likely to have private space and both 
accommodations. Women who participated in the WIC program during pregnancy were 
one-half as likely to have access to private space as were women who did not. Married and 
partnered women were more than 3 times as likely to have private space and both 
accommodations compared with single women. Women who did not meet previous 
breastfeeding intentions were approximately one-half as likely to have private space and 
both accommodations as women who had met their prior intentions.
Breastfeeding outcomes are shown in Table 4. After controlling for sociodemographic and 
birth-related covariates, women with sufficient break time were 2.6 times as likely to 
breastfeed exclusively (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0–6.7) and 3.0 times as likely to 
breastfeed at all (95% CI, 1.2–7.3) at 6 months postpartum compared with women without 
access to break time or private space. Women with access to both accommodations were 2.3 
times as likely to breastfeed exclusively at 6 months (95% CI, 1.0–5.0). Workplace 
accommodations are also significant predictors of breastfeeding duration. Women with 
private space and both accommodations were 3.8 and 1.5 times as likely, respectively, to 
continue breastfeeding exclusively each month (95% CI, 1.4–10.3 and 95% CI, 1.1–2.1). 
Overall, women with private space breastfeed for 1.36 months longer than women with no 
break time or private space, and those with both accommodations breastfeed for 0.44 months 
longer.
DISCUSSION
Based on our analysis, an estimated 1.8 million women return to work within 6 months after 
giving birth, out of the nearly 2.5 million US women who are employed during their 
pregnancies each year (Monte & Ellis, 2014). Although the ACA requires many employers 
to provide nursing mothers with reasonable break time and private space to express breast 
milk, this study finds that only 59% of women who returned to work postpartum reported 
having access to adequate break time to express milk, 45% had private space, and only 40% 
had access to both accommodations. Our findings also show that workplace 
accommodations for breastfeeding significantly predict breastfeeding outcomes at 6 months 
postpartum, as well as breastfeeding duration up to 20 months postpartum. Improving access 
to workplace-based breastfeeding support may have important health and financial 
implications for US families and employers.
How potential benefits accrue relates to the types of women who have access to 
accommodations and support. Our analysis also reveals systematic disparities in access to

 workplace accommodations for breastfeeding. Low-income women and single mothers are 
significantly less likely to have access to either break time or private space to express breast 
milk at work, mirroring the socioeconomic patterns of breastfeeding (Eidelman et al., 2012; 
Forste & Hoffmann, 2008; Taveras et al., 2003). Both of these groups of women were 
disproportionately affected, suggesting efforts to improve access could focus on employers 
that have a workforce of predominantly lower-wage female employees and single female 
employees. Strategies to address systemic disparities in health outcomes, including infant 
access to breast milk, must focus on the social determinants of health, which include the 
overall environment where people live and work. The rationale to focus on social 
determinants is important for all ages but particularly for infants, because improving the 
conditions that shape early child development can improve health throughout the life span 
(Wilensky & Satcher, 2009).
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND POLICY
Given the demonstrated health benefits of breastfeeding, these findings have important and 
actionable implications for clinicians, employers, and policymakers. For clinicians, an 
increased emphasis on postpartum support, particularly for women who plan to or have 
returned to work, may encourage women to continue any breastfeeding or breastfeeding 
exclusively for longer periods. Clinicians could also support their patients in obtaining 
breastfeeding supplies for expressing breast milk at work; the ACA-mandated women’s 
preventive services amendment now requires first-dollar insurance coverage for these 
supplies when medically necessary, and clinicians play an important role in communicating 
this benefit to patients and encouraging their use (U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, 2010; U.S. National Archives and Records Administration, 2013).
For employers, accommodations that support breastfeeding – even beyond the minimum 
break time and private space mandated by the ACA – should be included in comprehensive 
workplace policies aimed at improving the health of employees and their families. Although 
employers are often aware of the health benefits of breastfeeding, many do not list 
breastfeeding support for employees as a priority; similarly, many women report being 
unaware of breastfeeding-related policies in their workplace and desire more support for 
breastfeeding from their employers (Brown, Poag, & Kasprzycki, 2001; Kosmala-Anderson 
& Wallace, 2006). Employers should establish clear and easily understood policies for 
employees to request reasonable break time and private space to express breast milk, as well 
as taking measures to inform employees about their right to access these accommodations. 
Like other workplace wellness programs, such as those encouraging physical activity, 
support for breastfeeding in the workplace can improve employee health, reduce 
absenteeism, and generate savings for employers (Baicker, Cutler, & Song, 2010). These 
incentives should further motivate employers to not only comply with ACA-mandated 
accommodations for breastfeeding, but to find other innovative ways to support 
breastfeeding among their employees. Employers can hire, consult, or utilize occupational 
health nurses and physicians or human resources personnel for information and guidance on 
policies and programs, or they can consult online resources available from the Centers for 
Disease Control (http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/policy/index.htm) and the Department 
of Health and Human Services (http://mchb.hrsa.gov/pregnancyandbeyond/breastfeeding/).

 These resources may be useful in guiding employers to not only comply fully and 
comprehensively with mandated accommodations for breastfeeding in the workplace, but 
also to foster a workplace environment that views breastfeeding positively. Across all 
occupations and income levels, women whose employers are actively supportive of 
breastfeeding may be more likely to not only reach their breastfeeding goals, but also to 
intend exclusive breastfeeding for longer durations due to viewing breastfeeding as 
compatible with their employment.
For local, state, and federal policymakers, study findings highlight the need for policy 
coupled with comprehensive oversight, including monitoring and enforcement alongside 
employer education and support, to ensure access to workplace accommodations for 
breastfeeding women. The ACA represents an important first step, but further policy work is 
warranted to overcome the access barriers identified in this analysis. In particular, efforts to 
address access for low-income women and single mothers are urgently needed. To ensure 
that existing requirements are met, evaluation and monitoring are crucial. Adopting 
employer-based reporting mechanisms detailing breastfeeding accommodations in the 
workplace—similar to those used to monitor ACA-mandated insurance coverage—may 
increase accountability, as may guidelines for reporting violations and penalties for 
employers who do not provide them (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2012, 2013). In addition, 
policymakers may consider adopting provisions that extend guaranteed access to workplace 
accommodations for breastfeeding to women not covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
These women are likely to be lower-income or work in jobs with less flexibility, which is 
associated with lower rates of breastfeeding initiation and shorter duration. Finally, at the 
federal level, incorporating the economic value of breastfeeding into calculations of gross 
domestic product can highlight the significant economic benefits of breastfeeding and 
provide a strong basis of support for programs and regulations that protect and support 
breastfeeding in the workplace.
Limitations
This study had several important limitations that provide context for interpreting the 
findings. All data were based on retrospective self-report and thus were susceptible to recall 
and social desirability bias, particularly with regard to breastfeeding intention and duration. 
Some issues with self-selection may arise; for instance, the availability of workplace 
accommodations for breastfeeding may influence women’s decisions to return to work, or 
women who are more intent on breastfeeding may select workplace with more generous 
accommodations for breastfeeding. Because the data in this survey were collected after ACA 
provisions for breastfeeding accommodations had been implemented, we expect the 
variation in employer policies to be much smaller than they had been previously, thereby 
minimizing self-selection biases. However, the quality and accessibility of these 
accommodations may not be consistent across all employers (Bai et al., 2015), which may 
leave room for selection bias. Another potential limitation was that respondents may have 
found the definition of “reasonable break time” to be vague; however, this reflects the 
language used in the ACA. Future studies could gather more detailed data to examine the 
specific types of amenities as well as the amount of break time needed to support 
improvements in breastfeeding outcomes. The data also lack information on employer type

 and size, as well as maternal occupation category. As the ACA-mandated accommodations 
apply only to employees covered under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which applies only to 
certain employers (government agencies, hospitals, schools, and any companies with more 
than $500000 in annual sales or receipts), women in some occupations (e.g., service or retail 
industries, seasonal or farm workers) may be less likely to have access to these 
accommodations. Both formal and informal barriers to accessing workplace 
accommodations may vary across employers and occupational categories. More granular 
data in future studies would aid policy implementation and interpretation of findings. 
Finally, the data were cross-sectional and did not reflect whether any significant changes in 
access to workplace accommodations have occurred as a result of the ACA. Despite these 
limitations, the Listening to Mothers III survey remains a unique source of detailed 
information on women’s experiences in the workplace and breastfeeding postpartum, and 
our analyses represent a first look at the association between workplace accommodations 
and breastfeeding outcomes in the wake of US health care reform.
CONCLUSION
Clinicians, employers, and policymakers should work together with pregnant women and 
mothers to prioritize workplace support for employed women who are breastfeeding. Efforts 
to fully implement the accommodation required by the ACA and expand these provisions 
will improve access to breast milk for all infants, particularly those from families and 
communities that experience greater challenges in achieving optimal health and well-being.
