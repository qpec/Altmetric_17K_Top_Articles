Summary
Background KCNJ11 mutations cause permanent neonatal diabetes through pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium 
channel activation. 90% of patients successfully transfer from insulin to oral sulfonylureas with excellent initial 
glycaemic control; however, whether this control is maintained in the long term is unclear. Sulfonylurea failure is 
seen in about 44% of people with type 2 diabetes after 5 years of treatment. Therefore, we did a 10-year multicentre 
follow-up study of a large international cohort of patients with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes to address the 
key questions relating to long-term efficacy and safety of sulfonylureas in these patients.
Methods In this multicentre, international cohort study, all patients diagnosed with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal 
diabetes at five laboratories in Exeter (UK), Rome (Italy), Bergen (Norway), Paris (France), and Krakow (Poland), who 
transferred from insulin to oral sulfonylureas before Nov 30, 2006, were eligible for inclusion. Clinicians collected 
clinical characteristics and annual data relating to glycaemic control, sulfonylurea dose, severe hypoglycaemia, 
side-effects, diabetes complications, and growth. The main outcomes of interest were sulfonylurea failure, defined as 
permanent reintroduction of daily insulin, and metabolic control, specifically HbA1c and sulfonylurea dose. 
Neurological features associated with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes were also assessed. This study is 
registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02624817.
Findings 90 patients were identified as being eligible for inclusion and 81 were enrolled in the study and provided 
long-term (>5·5 years cut-off) outcome data. Median follow-up duration for the whole cohort was 10·2 years 
(IQR 9·3–10·8). At most recent follow-up (between Dec 1, 2012, and Oct 4, 2016), 75 (93%) of 81 participants 
remained on sulfonylurea therapy alone. Excellent glycaemic control was maintained for patients for whom we had 
paired data on HbA1c and sulfonylurea at all time points (ie, pre-transfer [for HbA1c], year 1, and most recent follow-
up; n=64)—median HbA1c was 8·1% (IQR 7·2–9·2; 65·0 mmol/mol [55·2–77·1]) before transfer to sulfonylureas, 
5·9% (5·4–6·5; 41·0 mmol/mol [35·5–47·5]; p<0·0001 vs pre-transfer) at 1 year, and 6·4% (5·9–7·3; 46·4 mmol/mol 
[41·0–56·3]; p<0·0001 vs year 1) at most recent follow-up (median 10·3 years [IQR 9·2–10·9]). In the same patients, 
median sulfonylurea dose at 1 year was 0·30 mg/kg per day (0·14–0·53) and at most recent follow-up visit was 
0·23 mg/kg per day (0·12–0·41; p=0·03). No reports of severe hypoglycaemia were recorded in 809 patient-years of 
follow-up for the whole cohort (n=81). 11 (14%) patients reported mild, transient side-effects, but did not need to 
stop sulfonylurea therapy. Seven (9%) patients had microvascular complications; these patients had been taking 
insulin longer than those without complications (median age at transfer to sulfonylureas 20·5 years [IQR 10·5–24·0] 
vs 4·1 years [1·3–10·2]; p=0·0005). Initial improvement was noted following transfer to sulfonylureas in 18 (47%) 
of 38 patients with CNS features. After long-term therapy with sulfonylureas, CNS features were seen in 52 (64%) 
of 81 patients.
Interpretation High-dose sulfonylurea therapy is an appropriate treatment for patients with KCNJ11 permanent 
neonatal diabetes from diagnosis. This therapy is safe and highly effective, maintaining excellent glycaemic control 
for at least 10 years.

Introduction
Treatment of neonatal diabetes with sulfonylurea therapy 
is the best example of precision medicine in diabetes.1 
Mutations in KCNJ11 resulting in activation of the 
pancreatic ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channel are the 
most common cause of permanent neonatal diabetes.2,3 
A genetic diagnosis is crucial, because at least 90% of 
patients can transfer from insulin injections to oral 
sulfonylureas, which bind to the sulfonylurea receptor 1 
(SUR1) component of the KATP channel, resulting in 
channel closure and enabling insulin secretion.4–6 After 
transferring to sulfonylurea treatment, patients have 
improved glycaemic control at 1 year, without an increase 
in hypoglycaemia6 and with less glycaemic variability.4,5
The long-term sustainability of sulfonylurea therapy in 
KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes is an important 
question, as in many other areas of precision medicine, 
initial excellent results have not been maintained. 
For example, in oncology, long-term outcomes in clinical 
studies have been disappointing, primarily because of 
heterogeneity within tumours allowing selection and 
proliferation of subclones of cancer cells that are resistant 
to treatments targeted at specific pathways.7
A key question is whether the excellent results in 
neonatal diabetes will be maintained or whether there will 
be sulfonylurea failure or adverse side-effects with 
long-term therapy. Sulfonylurea failure, when sulfonylurea 
therapy no longer maintains good glycaemic control, is 
seen in about 44% of people with type 2 diabetes after 
5 years of treatment.8 Data from follow-up studies9–11 have 
shown that the glycaemic response to sulfonylureas is 
maintained in KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes, but 
these have been single cases or small, single-centre cohort 
studies (all with 11 or fewer patients) and of short duration 
(between 2·5 and 5·7 years). Furthermore, sulfonylureas 
have safety issues—hypoglycaemia is a known side-effect 
of sulfonylurea treatment in type 2 diabetes, especially in 
relation to glibenclamide,12 the sulfonylurea commonly 
used to treat KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes. 
Therefore, hypoglycaemia and additional side-effects 
might occur with the long-term use of much higher doses 
of sulfonylureas used in patients with KCNJ11 permanent 
neonatal diabetes (0·45 mg/kg per day glibenclamide vs 
about 0·1 mg/kg per day in type 2 diabetes).6
In addition to diabetes, patients with KCNJ11 
mutations have CNS features, owing to expression of 
KCNJ11 in the brain, as well as the pancreas.13 CNS 
features range from overt and severe developmental 
delay, epilepsy, and neonatal diabetes (DEND) syndrome 
or immediate DEND syndrome and varying degrees of 
muscle weakness or hypotonia,14 to neurodevelopmental 
problems such as autism and attention deficit hyperactivity

Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2006, findings from a large cohort study established that 
high-dose sulfonylureas could be used to treat permanent 
neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ11 mutations. This result was 
life-changing for patients, allowing 90% to stop insulin 
injections and achieve better glycaemic control in the short term 
(1 year) without any increase in hypoglycaemia. The short-term 
benefit of transferring to sulfonylurea treatment has since been 
replicated in many follow-up studies. A key question is whether 
this positive outcome is maintained in the long term, 
particularly as after 5 years on therapy, about 44% of patients 
with type 2 diabetes show sulfonylurea failure and require 
additional therapies to maintain glycaemic control. 
Furthermore, sulfonylurea treatment in type 2 diabetes has been 
associated with hypoglycaemia, which raises a safety question, 
particularly since higher doses are used for permanent neonatal 
diabetes than for type 2 diabetes. We searched PubMed for 
articles published between April 1, 2004, and Sept 30, 2017, 
with no language restrictions, using the terms “KCNJ11”, 
“kir6.2”, “neonatal”, “diabetes”, “sulphonylurea”, “sulfonylurea”, 
“glibenclamide”, “glyburide”, “therapy”, and “treatment” to 
identify follow-up studies of sulfonylurea-treated patients with 
KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes. Only a few small (11 or 
fewer patients) short-term (2·5–5·7 years) follow-up studies 
have been reported, with the best study to date reporting 
maintenance of good glycaemic control in 11 patients from a 
single centre followed up for a median of 5·7 years. Before our 
study, it was unknown whether glycaemic control would be 
maintained when permanent neonatal diabetes due to KCNJ11 
mutations was treated with sulfonylurea therapy in the long 
term (10 years), whether this long-term therapy was safe, and 
what the long-term effect on neurological features would be.
Added value of this study
To our knowledge, ours is the first study of the long-term 
efficacy and safety of sulfonylureas in a large multicentre 
international cohort with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes. 
We showed that sulfonylurea failure, commonly seen in type 2 
diabetes, is not a feature of KCNJ11 permanent neonatal 
diabetes. Sulfonylureas were safe in the long term, even in high 
doses, in this unique group of patients and excellent glycaemic 
control was maintained over 10 years. Despite initial 
improvement in some patients, neurological features persisted 
with long-term use of sulfonylureas.
Implications of all the available evidence
All infants diagnosed with diabetes when younger than 
6 months should undergo rapid genetic testing to facilitate early 
transfer of those with KCNJ11 mutations to sulfonylureas as 
first-line treatment. This action should result in safe and 
long-lasting excellent glycaemic control for at least 10 years. 
Neurological features might show initial improvement but are 
likely to persist to varying degrees. However, further research is 
needed to establish the effect of very early transfer and 
high-dose sulfonylurea therapy on neurological features.

disorder (ADHD),15 to more subtle neuropsychological 
deficits, specifically inat 
tention, dyspraxia, and executive 
dysfunction.16,17 Findings from a prospective study18 
showed that sulfonylurea treatment resulted in a partial 
improvement in CNS features in people with KCNJ11 
permanent neonatal diabetes in the first year of therapy. 
However, the initial CNS response was not as substantial 
as the glycaemic response, which could be partly due 
to active transport of glibenclamide out of the brain, 
resulting in sub 
therapeutic concen 
trations in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).19 An important question, 
which to our knowledge has not been investigated by 
any studies to date, is whether long-term therapy with 
sulfonylureas has an effect on CNS features in KCNJ11 
permanent neonatal diabetes.
We did a 10-year multicentre follow-up study of a large 
international cohort of patients with KCNJ11 permanent 
neonatal diabetes to address these key questions relating 
to the long-term efficacy and safety of sulfonylurea 
treatment in patients with this rare form of diabetes.
Methods
Study design and participants
In this multicentre, international cohort study, all 
patients diagnosed with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal 
diabetes in laboratories in Exeter (UK), Rome (Italy), 
Bergen (Norway), Paris (France), and Krakow (Poland), 
who transferred from insulin to oral sulfonylureas before 
Nov 30, 2006, were eligible for inclusion (86 hospitals in 
20 countries provided data; appendix). Our research was 
done in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Patient clinical data was collected during routine care 
and was anonymised for use in the study. Informed 
consent was obtained from all patients or parents and 
assent was obtained in all cases in which the patient was 
younger than 16 years.
The study was approved by the ethics committees of 
the institutions in Exeter (UK), Bergen (Norway), Paris 
(France), Rome (Italy), and Krakow (Poland).
Procedures
Clinicians collected clinical characteristics and annual 
data relating to glycaemic control, sulfonylurea dose, 
severe hypoglycaemia, side-effects, diabetes compli-
cations, and growth. Height and BMI were converted to 
standard deviation scores by use of WHO reference 
ranges.20 Patients older than 19 years were assigned an age 
of 19 years for calculating BMI standard deviation score, 
as WHO reference ranges go up to age 19 years. 
CNS features, both neurological and psychiatric, were 
documented before transfer to oral sulfonylureas and at 
most recent follow-up visit. Clinicians were specifically 
asked about clinical characteristics frequently associated 
with KCNJ11 mutations (developmental delay, learning 
difficulties, epilepsy, muscle weakness, autism, ADHD, 
sleep problems, and anxiety)15,17,18,21,22 and whether there 
was an improvement in CNS features at the time of 
transfer to sulfonylureas. In cases in which the oral 
sulfonylurea used was not glibenclamide (four other drugs 
were used at any time during the study period: gliclazide 
[two patients], tolbutamide [one patient], glipizide [ten 
patients], and glimepiride [two patients]), the dose was 
expressed as a percentage of the maximum recommended 
daily dose (as per British National Formulary) and 
converted to an equivalent dose of glibenclamide.23 
Hypoglycaemia was defined as severe if the patient had a 
seizure, loss of consciousness, or was admitted to hospital 
for intravenous glucose or glucagon, as per International 
Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes criteria.24
Where possible, HbA1c and sulfonylurea dose were 
recorded on the same date within each year. When this 
was not possible, the HbA1c and sulfonylurea dose were 
measured as close together as possible within the same 
year. In patients who were receiving insulin because of 
pregnancy at most recent follow-up, data from the most 
recent pre-pregnancy review were used. Patients who 
had received a short course of insulin treatment at 
any point during follow-up but had subsequently 
transferred back to sulfonylurea treatment, and patients 
who required small occasional (non-replacement) doses 
of insulin, were classified as receiving sulfonylurea only.
We compared hypoglycaemia data for our study 
population with a cohort from the Norwegian Childhood 
Diabetes Registry of 664 Norwegian patients with type 1 
diabetes of mean duration 10·8 years (SD 2·2), followed 
up for more than 8 years after diagnosis.
In a physiological investigation of a subset of study 
patients who were diagnosed by the Bergen (Norway) 
laboratory, we did oral and intravenous glucose tolerance 
tests in six patients.
Outcomes
The main outcomes of interest were sulfonylurea failure, 
defined as permanent reintroduction of daily insulin, and 
metabolic control, specifically HbA1c and sulfonylurea 
dose. Data were collected by individual centres, then 
centrally collated in Exeter, Rome, Paris, Bergen, and 
Krakow, and analysed in Exeter. Other outcomes 
assessed were severe hypoglycaemia, side-effects, diabetes 
complications, growth, and effects of sulfonylurea therapy 
on CNS features. Data on side-effects were obtained from 
reports in the clinical notes.
Statistical analysis
Non-parametric statistical methods were used to analyse 
data—Wilcoxon test for paired data and Mann-Whitney 
U test for unpaired data. For outcomes with categorical 
data, two sample test of proportions was used. For all 
analyses, a p value of less than 0·05 was considered 
significant.
One objective of the study was to assess the number of 
patients needing reintroduction of insulin and the time 
to insulin reintroduction, by use of Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis. All patients were included in this analysis; for

the patients who had insulin reintroduced, time to 
reintroduction of insulin was calculated. For one patient 
in whom the date of reintroduction of insulin was not 
known, the most recent follow-up date was used to 
calculate duration and allow inclusion in the survival 
analysis. Patients who had not recommenced insulin 
were censored and their most recent follow-up date was 
used in analysis.
We used values that were nearest to the transfer date 
anniversary for analysis of longitudinal annual 
follow-up data. When values were not available within 
6 months either side of the anniversary of transfer, 
missing values were imputed (for year 1 data we 
included values from 3 months to 1·5 years).6 Imputed 
data were generated by taking mean values between 
two data points, assuming linear trends between data 
points and using equal increments depending on 
number of missing values, carrying the last value back 
or carrying the most recent value forward. Where 
two sets of data were available within a given year, the 
data closest to the anniversary of the transfer were used 
and the other data were excluded.
A two sample test of proportions was used to compare the 
percentage of patients with KCNJ11 permanent neo 
natal 
diabetes with any episodes of severe hypoglycaemia with 
the percentage of patients with type 1 diabetes with severe 
hypoglycaemia over the period of follow-up.
Data were analysed in Stata 14.0. This study is registered 
with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02624817

Results
90 patients were identified as being eligible for inclusion 
and 81 were enrolled in the study and provided long-term 
(>5·5 years cut-off) outcome data (figure 1; see appendix 
for clinical characteristics of patients included in the 
analysis vs those eligible but without follow-up data 
available). For the 81 patients included in the study, 
46 (57%) were male, median age at diabetes diagnosis 
was 8·0 weeks (IQR 4·0–12·0; n=74), and median age at 
transfer from insulin to sulfonylureas was 4·8 years 
(1·7–11·4; n=81). The date of most recent follow-up for 
included patients ranged from Dec 1, 2012, to Oct 4, 2016. 
All patients were diagnosed with diabetes at less than 
6 months of age and transferred from insulin to 
sulfonylureas between 0·2 and 34·5 years. The partici-
pants not followed up were similar to the participants in 
the study except they were older at transfer from insulin 
to sulfonylureas and younger at diabetes diagnosis 
(appendix). Median duration of follow-up for the study 
cohort was 10·2 years (9·3–10·8).
Sulfonylurea therapy was highly effective, with 75 (93%) 
of 81 participants remaining on sulfonylureas without 
regular insulin treatment at most recent follow-up 
(figure 2). No patients discontinued sulfonylurea treat-
ment. Excellent glycaemic control was maintained and the 
sulfonylurea dose fell over 10 years (figure 2). In patients 
remaining on sulfonylurea therapy alone who had 
both sulfonylurea and HbA1c data at all required time 
points (n=64), median HbA1c was 8·1% (IQR 7·2–9·2; 
65·0 
mmol/mol 
[55·2–77·1]) 
before 
transfer 
to 
sulfonylurea, 5·9% (5·4–6·5; 41·0 mmol/mol [35·5–47·5]) 
at 1 year (p<0·0001 vs pre-transfer), and 6·4% (5·9–7·3; 
46·4 mmol/mol [41·0–56·3]) at most recent follow-up 
(median 10·3 years [IQR 9·2–10·9]; p<0·0001 vs 1 year). In 
the same patients, median sulfonylurea dose at 1 year was 
0·30 mg/kg per day (0·14–0·53) and at most recent follow-
up visit was 0·23 mg/kg per day (0·12–0·41; p=0·03).
Sulfonylurea therapy was safe over the follow-up 
period. No reports of hypoglycaemia resulting in 
seizures or loss of consciousness were made in a total of 
809 patient-years of follow-up of the whole cohort. 
This finding contrasts with the hypoglycaemia noted in 
664 Norwegian patients with type 1 diabetes followed up 
for more than 8 years, among whom 296 (45%) patients 
reported at least one episode of severe hypoglycaemia, 
with 912 episodes reported in total. The proportion of 
patients with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes 
having one or more episodes of severe hypoglycaemia 
during the period of follow-up was 0 (0%) of 81 compared 
with 296 (45%) of 664 patients with type 1 diabetes 
(p<0·0001).
Side-effects occurring at any point over the 10-year 
follow-up were reported by 11 (14%) of 81 patients;

nine had gastrointestinal disturbance, including four with 
transient diarrhoea, one with diarrhoea requiring further 
investigation, two with transient nausea, one with weight 
loss due to reduced appetite, and one with transient 
abdominal pain. One patient had initial hepatic steatosis 
and one had tooth discolouration. No reports were 
made of photosensitivity, hypersensitivity reactions, 
or abnormal renal function. No patients discontinued 
sulfonylurea treatment because of side-effects.
At most recent follow-up, daily insulin was required in 
addition to sulfonylureas in six patients (appendix). 
Compared with patients treated with sulfonylurea alone, 
patients also requiring insulin had poorer glycaemic 
control at most recent follow-up (median HbA1c 8·5%, 
IQR 8·1–10·2 [69·4 mmol/mol, 65·0–88·0] vs 6·3%, 
5·9–7·1 
[45·4 
mmol/mol, 
41·0–54·1]; 
p=0·0006). 
All six patients in the insulin-treated group were 
male. Other characteristics were similar between the 
two groups (table).
BMI data was available at year 1 and most recent 
follow-up in 58 patients who remained on sulfonylurea 
alone throughout the study. BMI decreased during 
follow-up, despite improved glycaemia (median BMI 
standard deviation score 0·21 [IQR −0·25 to 0·84] before 
sulfonylurea transfer vs −0·25 [−1·07 to 0·42] at most 
recent follow-up; p=0·0009). Height at year 1 and most 
recent follow-up was available for 38 patients who 
remained on sulfonylurea alone and within the paediatric 
age range for the duration of the follow-up. Growth of 
paediatric patients was within the normal WHO 
reference range. Median height standard deviation score 
before transfer to sulfonylurea was −0·46 (−1·29 to 0·37) 
compared with −0·29 (−1·01 to 0·73) at most recent 
follow-up (p=0·31).
Diabetes complications were rare: seven (9%) of 
81 patients reported microvascular complications, which 
comprised retinopathy (five patients: one background, 
two 
non-proliferative, 
one 
pre-proliferative, 
and 
one pro 
liferative), microalbuminuria (two patients), pro-
teinuria (one patient), and neuropathy (one patient). 
In two patients, non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and 
neuropathy developed before transfer to sulfonylureas. 
No macrovascular complications were reported. Patients 
with complications were older at age of transfer to 
sulfonylureas than were those without complications 
(median 20·5 years [10·5–24·0] vs 4·1 years [1·3–10·2]; 
p=0·0005). Other clinical characteristics were similar 
between the two groups (appendix).
To evaluate β-cell function, we did oral and intravenous 
glucose tolerance tests in six patients who had received 
sulfonylurea treatment for a median of 9·83 years 
(IQR 6·75–11·4; appendix) after transfer from insulin 
and who remained on sulfonylurea alone at most recent 
follow-up. Oral glucose tolerance tests revealed a good 
insulin response to glucose challenge (figure 3). We noted 
a greater maximum insulin secretory response to oral 
glucose than to intravenous glucose (maximum insulin

[range 42·0–135·1] and in response to intravenous 
glucose 30·5 pmol/L [range 0·0–46·9]) despite an 
increased plasma glucose stimulus. This result suggests 
that the increased incretin effect seen with sulfonylurea 
treatment after initial transfer6 is well preserved after 
long-term treatment.
CNS features were documented before transfer to 
sulfonylurea in 38 (47%) of 81 patients (figure 4; appendix). 
Features were usually consistent with those previously 
described in patients with KCNJ11 mutations, but 
features associated with severe cerebral insult at the 
time of presentation with ketoacidosis were also present

in four patients. All 19 patients with Val59Met, the 
commonest DEND-associated mutation, had CNS 
features before transfer to sulfonylureas (appendix). An 
improvement was reported in 18 (47%) of 38 patients at 
the time of transfer to sulfonylurea, specifically in 
muscle tone (four patients), concen 
tration or ADHD 
(five patients), gross motor skills (three patients), epilepsy 
(three patients), muscle weakness (three patients), 
learning difficulties (two patients), speech (one patient), 
and tics (one patient). However, improvement was 
incomplete in 17 (94%) of 18 patients and considerable 
CNS features remained. Full resolution occurred in only 
one female patient with unilateral hypotonia of the arm. 
At most recent follow-up, CNS features were seen in 
52 (64%) of 81 patients, including 15 patients in whom 
CNS features were not noted before transfer to sulf-
onylureas (appendix). These 15 patients transferred at a 
median age of 2·1 years and the new CNS features were 
mainly neuropsychological or psychiatric, which would 
become more obvious as the child got older. Several 
additional neuropsychological or psychiatric features 
were also detected after sulfonylurea transfer in patients 
who had neurological involvement at baseline (appendix).
Discussion
In our large international cohort study of patients with 
KCNJ11 
permanent 
neonatal 
diabetes, 
long-term 
(10 years) sulfonylurea therapy was safe and effective. 
75 (93%) of 81 patients maintained excellent glycaemic 
control at long-term follow-up and were taking on 
average a lower dose of sulfonylurea when expressed as 
dose per kg bodyweight. These results are consistent 
with findings from previous smaller studies, which 
followed up single cases or much smaller cohorts of 
patients over shorter time periods.9–11
Our findings contrast with data from patients with 
type 2 diabetes treated with sulfonylureas, in which about 
44% of patients have inadequate glycaemic control after 
5 years of treatment despite increasing to a maximum 
dose.8 Several reasons could account for these different

outcomes. First, in KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes 
there is a fixed β-cell defect that does not change over 
time, whereas in type 2 diabetes there is a deterioration 
in β-cell function of about 5% per year of diabetes.25 
Second, in KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes, 
high-dose sulfonylureas facilitate the response to 
alternative pathway stimuli and do not directly stimulate 
insulin secretion as in type 2 diabetes.6 The prolonged 
action seen in KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes also 
contrasts with many other examples of precision 
medicine, wherein excellent initial results have not been 
maintained in the long term.7
Excellent glycaemic control was achieved with 
sulfonylurea therapy in the patients in our study, without 
the usual side-effects of hypoglycaemia and weight gain 
seen when intensive insulin therapy is used in patients 
with type 1 diabetes.26 In our study, the absence of any 
episodes of hypoglycaemia resulting in unconsciousness 
or seizures in a total of 809 patient-years of follow-up 
contrasts with data from patients with type 1 diabetes, in 
whom intensive insulin treatment administered via an 
external insulin pump or by three or more daily insulin 
injections resulted in an approximately three times 
increase in episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (16 vs 
five episodes per 100 patient-years) when compared with 
patients receiving conventional therapy with one or 
two daily insulin injections.27 Most of our cohort were 
treated with glibenclamide, which is the sulfonylurea 
most associated with hypoglycaemia in type 2 diabetes.12 
The absence of severe hypoglycaemia in our study is 
reassuring, as the doses of glibenclamide used in 
KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes are four to ten times 
higher than those used in type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, 
our data shows a reduction in BMI of 0·46 standard 
deviation scores (p=0·0009; around a 7% reduction in 
baseline adult equivalent BMI) over the 10-year follow-up 
period, despite improved metabolic control. By contrast, 
in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial,26 
improved control was associated with an around 4% 
increase in BMI over 1 year compared with conventional 
treatment in patients with type 1 diabetes. The absence 
of both hypoglycaemia and weight gain reflect that 
endogenous insulin secretion is tightly regulated in 
patients with permanent neonatal diabetes. Reassuringly, 
our study did not identify any unexpected side-effects of 
high-dose sulfonylurea therapy. However, since only 
81 patients were followed up, long-term surveillance of 
this cohort and other patients who transfer to 
sulfonylurea therapy should continue in order to detect 
any unexpected side-effects.
Several reasons could explain why six (7%) of the 
81 patients in our study required daily insulin in addition 
to sulfonylurea therapy during follow-up. The median 
age at introduction of insulin was 15 years, so many 
patients were peripubertal. This fact is important because 
puberty is associated with increased insulin resistance28 
and suboptimal treatment adherence in diabetes.29 
For two patients, poor adherence to sulfonylurea was 
specifically mentioned by their clinicians, and poor 
glycaemic control usually continued even after insulin 
was added. Patients requiring reintroduction of insulin 
were on a fairly modest sulfonylurea dose (median 
0·27 mg/kg per day, range 0·19–0·43), suggesting there 
was capacity to increase the dose further. Taken together, 
our data suggest that factors other than sulfonylureas 
having stopped working at the level of the KATP channel 
might have contributed to the need for the addition of 
insulin treatment in these patients.
We found low rates of diabetes-related complications 
in patients with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes. 
This result could reflect improved glycaemic control 
reducing the risk of microvascular complications, as 
has been reported in type 1 diabetes.27 The seven (9%) 
patients with complications transferred from insulin 
later than did those without complications (median 
20·5 years vs 4·1 years). Therefore, these patients 
had the suboptimal glycaemic control (HbA1c 8·7% 
[72 mmol/mol] pre-transfer) associated with insulin 
therapy for many years before improved control on 
sulfonylureas (6·5% [47·4 mmol/mol] post-transfer). 
We propose that the reported complications were 
largely the result of chronically elevated HbA1c before 
transfer to sulfonylurea therapy.
We showed in physiological studies in a small subset of 
patients that sulfonylurea-assisted insulin secretion 
shows a similar pattern after 10 years of follow-up 
as immediately post-transfer.6 Insulin secretion was 
excellent in response to oral glucose, but was minimal in 
response to intravenous glucose, reflecting that activating 
mutations in KCNJ11 prevent the KATP channel from

closing in response to metabolically generated ATP—a 
defect that is bypassed by sulfonylureas. Although the 
presence of sulfonylureas increases the effect of glucose-
stimulated insulin secretion, this effect was small 
compared with the potentiation of insulin secretion seen 
in response to the incretins produced following a meal.
CNS features in KCNJ11 permanent neonatal diabetes 
persisted despite long-term treatment with sulfonylureas, 
contrasting with the excellent glycaemic response. 
Although some initial improvement in CNS features was 
seen in 18 (47%) of 38 patients after transferring to 
sulfonylureas, this effect was usually incomplete and 
subsequently plateaued. This initial improvement is 
consistent with findings from the prospective study by 
Beltrand and colleagues.18 Notably, a higher proportion of 
patients in our study (64%) had CNS features reported 
at most recent follow-up than before transfer to 
sulfonylureas (47%). This finding could be explained by 
some patients having been too young to have had subtle 
features picked up clinically when first diagnosed, or 
heightened awareness among clinicians to look for subtle 
features at the most recent clinical follow-up because of 
improved characterisation of the CNS phenotype over 
the past decade.
The underlying reason for the poor or absent CNS 
response despite an excellent long-term glycaemic 
response in the same patients is not clear. Both CNS 
features and diabetes are believed to be a direct result of 
the mutated KATP channel, and sulfonylureas could be 
expected to have a similar effect on the channels 
irrespective of their location. One possible explanation 
for the poor or absent CNS response is that concentrations 
of glibenclamide in the CSF could remain subtherapeutic 
because of active transport across the blood–brain barrier 
out of the brain.19 Another possibility is that insulin 
secretion is supported by non-KATP-channel-mediated 
pathways, which are not available for neuronal function.6 
Furthermore, late transfer to sulfonylureas might have 
resulted in crucial periods for brain development being 
missed; this theory is supported by the suggestion that 
earlier initiation of sulfonylurea treatment leads to better 
neurological outcomes.18,30 Further research is needed to 
investigate treatments to improve CNS function in 
patients with KCNJ11 mutations, as our data show this is 
a major clinical challenge for patients who have achieved 
excellent glycaemic control.
Our study has several strengths. To our knowledge, this 
is the largest cohort of people with KCNJ11 permanent 
neonatal diabetes to have been followed up to date, with 
81 patients compared with 11 patients in the largest 
previous study.11 Our study also represents the longest 
period of follow-up, greatly exceeding the 2·5–5·7 year 
follow-ups reported previously.9–11 81 (90%) of 90 eligible 
patients were included in the analysis, which ensured the 
findings accurately represent this unique population.
However, our study has some limitations. First, patients 
were not initially randomly assigned to either sulfonylurea 
therapy or continuing intensive insulin treatment, 
therefore we cannot definitively rule out that the same 
outcome would not have been achieved on insulin therapy 
alone. However, these patients were insulin dependent 
and no long-term study of any type of insulin regimen

has produced long-term outcomes in type 1 diabetes like 
those reported here. Second, our research involved 
multiple centres around the world, which could have 
meant variation in clinical practice in terms of type of 
sulfonylurea used, dosing of sulfonylurea, and threshold 
for reintroduction of insulin. However, our study reflects 
real-life clinical practice, and its multicentre nature 
ensured that the largest possible number of patients was 
followed up, thereby increasing the robustness of the 
study and the generalisability of the findings. The main 
limitation of our evaluation of neurological features is 
that neuropsychomotor assessment was done across all 
centres, rather than a detailed neuropsychomotor assess-
ment being done in a single centre (to ensure consistency 
of assessment) before and after transfer to sulfonylurea 
therapy in all patients.
Further research is required to establish efficacy and 
safety of sulfonylureas beyond 10 years and to investigate 
other aspects of treatment response, such as effects of 
puberty. Additionally, future research should further 
explore the effects of long-term sulfonylurea treatment 
on neurological, neuropsychological, and psychiatric 
features in patients with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal 
diabetes, including through in-depth neuropsychomotor 
assessments repeated over time.
In conclusion, our results suggest that sulfonylureas 
are highly effective and safe when used to treat KCNJ11 
permanent neonatal diabetes for over 10 years. These 
data support early and rapid genetic testing of infants 
younger than 6 months with diabetes to facilitate prompt 
transfer of all patients with KCNJ11 permanent neonatal 
diabetes to sulfonylurea treatment.
