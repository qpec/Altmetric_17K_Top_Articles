OBJECTIVES: To estimate associations between long-
term use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and pneumonia
incidence in older adults in primary care.
DESIGN:
Longitudinal
analyses
of
electronic
medical
records.
SETTING: England
PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 60 and older in pri-
mary care receiving PPIs for 1 year or longer (N575,050)
and age- and sex-matched controls (N575,050).
MEASUREMENTS: Net hazard ratios for pneumonia
incidence in Year 2 of treatment were estimated using the
prior event rate ratio (PERR), which adjusts for pneumo-
nia incidence differences before initiation of treatment.
Inverse probability weighted models adjusted for 78 demo-
graphic,
disease,
medication,
and
healthcare
usage
measures.
RESULTS: During the second year after initiating treat-
ment, PPIs were associated with greater hazard of incident
pneumonia (PERR-adjusted hazard ratio51.82, 95% con-
fidence interval51.27–2.54), accounting for pretreatment
pneumonia rates. Estimates were similar across age and
comorbidity subgroups. Similar results were also obtained
from propensity score– and inverse probability–weighted
models.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of older adults in pri-
mary care, PPI prescription was associated with greater
risk of pneumonia in the second year of treatment. Results
were robust across alternative analysis approaches. Con-
troversies about the validity of reported short-term harms
of PPIs should not divert attention from potential long-
term effects of PPI prescriptions on older adults. J Am

P
roton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are widely prescribed to
reduce gastric acid production and for gastroprotec-
tion,1,2 but there is evidence of frequent prescribing of
PPIs without adequate indication.3 PPI use has been linked
to higher rates of several conditions, including osteopor-
otic fractures,4–6 cardiovascular disease,7,8 and Clostrid-
ium difficile infection.7–9
PPIs act directly on H1/K1- ATPase enzymes, reduc-
ing acid secretion, but gastric acid plays a vital role in the
innate response to bacterial infection. Without this protec-
tion, bacterial colonization occurs,10 increasing the risk of
bacterial micro-aspiration and pulmonary colonization.
Several studies, including meta-analyses, have reported
high risk of pneumonia soon after PPI therapy initia-
tion,11–15 although negative associations have also been
reported.16,17 A recent observational study of the first year
after PPI prescription16 used the prior event rate ratio
(PERR),18–21 which adjusts differences in postprescription
pneumonia incidence between cases and controls with pre-
existing differences to correct for unmeasured confound-
ing. That study used data from individuals in primary care
in England and found that pneumonia rates increased dur-
ing the first 30 days of PPI prescription (incidence rate
ratio (IRR)51.19, 95% confidence interval (CI)51.14–
1.25), but pneumonia rates were even higher during the
30 days immediately before the first PPI prescription
(IRR51.92, 95% CI51.84–2.00), perhaps because the
greater medical scrutiny of individuals with pneumonia led

 to more PPI prescribing for comorbidities, including medi-
cations commonly co-prescribed with PPIs. The PERR
analysis, accounting for these prior differences, indicated
no additional effect of PPIs on pneumonia risk in the 30
days or first year of treatment periods, but no data on
longer-term effects have been reported.
Approximately 40% of elderly adults receive PPIs,
and appropriate clinical indications may be lacking for up
to 85% of PPIs prescribed.22,23 Pneumonia is a major
cause of death,24,25 costing in excess of $17 billion per
year in the United States alone.26 It is therefore important
to clarify associations between PPIs and pneumonia for
short- and long-term exposure, especially in older adults,
who may be most at risk from lack of barriers to respira-
tory infection. We therefore aimed to estimate long-term
associations between PPI prescription and risk of pneumo-
nia in individuals in primary care aged 60 and older, simi-
larly applying the PERR approach to account for prior
differences between PPI-treated individuals and controls.
METHODS
Data source
Data in this analysis were from Clinical Practice Research
Datalink (CPRD) for England, a large de-identified database
of primary care electronic medical records from participating
practices.27 Clinicians entered data as the main record of
each consultation; the extract available for research includes
basic demographic characteristics, diagnoses, prescriptions,
vaccinations, and specialist referrals. The primary care data
are linked for research purposes to each individual’s hospital
discharge diagnoses (from the National Health Service Hos-
pital Episode Statistics) and death certificates from the Office
of National Statistics database for individuals in England.
Virtually all older adults in England are registered with a pri-
mary care practice and receive all routine prescriptions (all
dispensed free of charge) through that practice.
CPRD received multiple research ethics committee
approval
(05/MRE04/87)

from the CPRD Independent Scientific Advisory Commit-
tee (Protocol 15/210R).
STUDY POPULATION AND FOLLOW-UP
We selected individuals aged 60 and older who had PPI
prescriptions recorded in each calendar quarter for 1 year
or longer and had clinical records for 1 year or longer
before first PPI prescription. Seventy-five thousand fifty
individuals (Supplementary Figure 1S) in the database met
these criteria (n531,202 men, n543,848 women). PPI-
treated individuals were 1-to-1 matched with 75,050 con-
trols who had not received a PPI prescription. Matching
was according to sex and year of birth only. The date of
first PPI prescription was designated as the index date for
analyses. After the matching, each treated individual’s
date of first PPI prescription was copied to his or her
matched control.
Exposure and study end point
PPIs (esomeprazole, lansoprazole, omeprazole, pantopra-
zole, rabeprazole sodium) were identified in records based

Community-acquired
pneumonia
(pneumonia)
has
been defined previously elsewhere29–31 based on ascertain-
ment in linked primary care and hospital admission
records. Pneumonia diagnosis 14 days or less after dis-
charge was regarded as hospital-acquired pneumonia and
excluded.29,30 Diagnoses of pneumonia 28 days or less
from each other were considered the same event. A pneu-
monia diagnosis 30 days or less from an individual’s regis-
tration with a practices was also excluded as possibly
reflecting historical records.30,31
Covariates
Disease burden status was defined according to the Charl-
son Comorbidity Index32 as low (0) or high (>0) comor-
bidity.
In

adjusted
survival
estimates for propensity scores33–35 based on 78 variables
summarizing demographic characteristics, diseases, drugs,
and healthcare usage. (See Supplementary Table S1 for full
list.) Missing data were coded as separate categories.
Details of statistical methods
An intention-to-treat approach including all individuals
who received PPIs for at least 1 year, irrespective of details
of treatment in the second year, was used for analyses to
avoid biases that excluding those who stopped taking PPIs
because of related adverse events might cause. As noted,
75,050 individuals with a PPI prescription for at least 1
year were included. In the second year, 64,364 of the
75,050 (85.8%) received prescriptions in at least 1 calen-
dar quarter of the second year, with 55,961 (64.1%)
receiving treatment during 3 of 4 calendar quarters of the
second year.
PERR analyses were based on unadjusted Cox propor-
tional hazard models, in accordance with validation stud-
ies.19,20,36 Post-PPI hazard ratios (HRs) were adjusted by
pre-PPI HRs using the PERR method (Supplementary Fig-
ure 2S) to account for unmeasured confounding and pre-
sented as PERR HRs and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) obtained using bootstrapping.18,19,37 PERR analyses
require independence of events in the pre-PPI period from
risk of subsequent exposure. PERR also assumes that
unmeasured confounding is time invariant.20 PERR analy-
ses analyzed post-PPI pneumonia risk adjusted by unmeas-
ured confounding from the 24- to 13-month period before
a PPI (Supplementary Figure 2S). The number needed to
harm was computed using an established formula38 and
bootstrapped to obtain 95% confidence limits. Subgroup
analyses according to age and comorbidity were specified
a priori in our original analysis application to CPRD.
Several alternative approaches were used in sensitivity
analyses to test the robustness of our findings. Cox propor-
tional hazard models adjusted by propensity scores33,34
(details in Supplementary Table 1) were performed in sensi-
tivity analyses for the post-PPI period. Inverse-weighted

 probability models included 78 putative, measured con-
founders covering demographic characteristics, diagnoses,
medication, and healthcare usage measures (details in Sup-
plementary Table S1). The PERR-ALT method,36 a variant
of PERR analysis using a cross-over-like design with clus-
tered (or paired) Cox models, with posttreatment events in
treated individuals compared with pretreatment events in
controls and vice versa, was also used. The PERR and pro-
pensity scoring approaches for addressing confounding in
nonrandomized longitudinal studies have been reviewed
elsewhere.39 All statistical analyses were performed in Stata
version 14 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).
RESULTS
Records for 75,050 PPI-treated individuals and 75,050
matched controls were eligible for the primary analyses.
Mean age in treated individuals and controls at index date
was 7167.3, and 58% of PPI-treated and control partici-
pants were female (Table 1). Treated participants had
greater comorbidity (54.2% with Charlson Index �1)
than controls (36.2%). Details of diagnosis and prescrip-
tion differences between the treated and control groups
can be found in Supplementary Table S1.
Incidence rates
In the PPI-treated group, unadjusted pneumonia incidence
rates were less than 6 per 1,000 person-years from 24 to 6
months before treatment but then rose considerably in the
last 6 months before treatment (peak: 22 PPI-treated indi-
viduals per 1,000 person-years) (Figure 1). In the post-PPI
treatment period, pneumonia incidence declined to a stable
incidence of approximately 8 per 1,000 person-years in
the first year but then showed a generally upward trend in
the second year after PPI treatment. Pneumonia incidence
in controls was lower (<4/1,000 person-years) and more
stable throughout. Numbers of pneumonia events accord-
ing to participant subgroup are shown in Supplementary
Table S2.

 In Cox survival estimates for months 24 to 13 before a
PPI prescription, pneumonia was more common in PPI-
treated individuals than controls (HR51.67, 95% CI51.37–
2.02), but in the second year of the post-PPI period, this
excess pneumonia risk was substantially larger (HR53.03,
95% CI52.6–3.53). The estimate of net long-term association
according to the PERR calculation was significant (HR51.82,
95% CI51.27–2.54), suggesting substantial excess long-term
pneumonia risk (Table 2). The number needed to harm esti-
mate for this result was 420 (95% CI5113–1,996).
The results in our prespecified age and comorbidity
subgroups (Table 2) show broadly similar PERR estimates
for the association between PPIs and pneumonia. Inspection
of PERR CIs suggested no interactions and no main effect
by these subgroups, although some subgroup-specific esti-
mates had wide CIs, reflecting smaller numbers (Table 2).
Sensitivity analysis
We used several alternative analysis approaches to check the
robustness of our findings. Inverse probability weighting
models and propensity scoring models were based on 78
measured
potential
confounders
covering
demographic
characteristics, diagnoses, medication, and healthcare usage
measures (details in Supplementary Table S1). The inverse
probability–weighted models yielded results similar to those
of PERR (Table 3), as did propensity score modelling and
adjustment for baseline variables. Primary analyses were
reproduced using the PERR-ALT method (Supplementary
Table S5), which also produced similar results. Models of
alternative time windows (months 7 to 24 before and after
PPI treatment) also yielded similar results (Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4).

between

and

 use after accounting for preexisting differences in pneumo-
nia rates between treated and control groups. Reassur-
ingly, the inverse probability–weighted and propensity
score approaches accounting for 78 demographic, disease,
medication, and healthcare usage measures in treated and
control participants (in post-PPI Cox models) gave similar
results, suggesting that the findings are robust. Although
the number needed to harm was relatively large (420 par-
ticipants for 12 months), given the high prevalence and
frequent continuation of PPIs without good indication,3
this number needed to harm represents a significant risk
to older adults. Analyses according to age and comorbidity
subgroups produced similar estimates, although larger
samples are needed to confirm this.
Strengths and limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, the CPRD dataset
used is representative of the general U.K. population,27 so
our results should have good external validity. As previ-
ously demonstrated,19,36 the PERR and PERR-ALT can
approximate results of randomized controlled trials when
suitably applied to observational clinical records. Our
analyses were also designed to reduce confounding by
focusing on long-term outcomes.
Inevitably there are limitations. Our matching of
treatment groups (according to date of birth and sex only)
may seem crude, but many potentially important differen-
ces between treatment and control groups go unrecorded
in clinical records. The PERR method seeks to account for
measured and unmeasured differences between groups by
adjusting for differences in the outcome (pneumonia rates)
before treatment started, so complex matching on baseline
measures is redundant and was not used in validation of
the PERR method. Our sensitivity analyses using propen-
sity scoring and inverse probability–weighting approaches
accounted for many measured potential confounders and
provided similar results, but our list of potential measures
did not include, for example, neurological diseases other
than stroke that might increase risk of outpatient aspira-
tion, and better measures of this and other risks should be
used in future studies. Addition of a falsification analysis,
using a condition not related to PPI exposure, could
strengthen future work, although identifying a repeated-
event condition suitable for PERR analysis and potentially
being exposed to similar biases to pneumonia would be
challenging.
This study used prescription records from primary
care and therefore omitted individuals who obtained over-
the-counter PPIs, but PPIs are sold in small packs over the
counter in England, and long-term use would be expen-
sive. Because older adults receive free prescriptions and
free consultations in the U.K. National Health Services, it
is likely that our treatment group selection identified the
great majority of long-term PPI use. We were also not
able to control for adherence to treatment, but over-the-
counter use and nonadherence would, in general, tend to
reduce estimated effect sizes and are implausible explana-
tions for the excess pneumonia risks identified. Data on
indications and daily doses are complex and incomplete in
the CPRD data, but accounting for these factors may
strengthen future work. There may be drug-drug interac-
tions modifying the effects of PPIs, which could be exam-
ined in future work. Furthermore, the PERR method
cannot address time-dependent confounding. By excluding
the year before PPI therapy in the main analysis, we
reduced the risk of indication biases, but not longer-term
time-dependent confounding, although the consistency of
our results across the differing analysis approaches used
suggests that such effects are likely to be small.
Comparison with previous literature
The safety of PPIs has been assessed using records from
CPRD (e.g.),16 retrospective data from randomized con-
trolled
trials,40
and
several
meta-analytical
and
population-based
studies,12,13,41,42
including
a
meta-
analytical multiple-database study of individuals treated
with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs1 and a study of
individuals with nontraumatic intracranial hemorrhage.2
Conclusions on PPI safety have been derived mainly from
observational research and have led to conflicting sugges-
tions on the role of confounding by indication in the asso-
ciation between PPIs and pneumonia.15–17 Observational
studies to date, including meta-analyses, have reported on
approximately 30% greater PPI-related risk of pneumo-
nia.11–13 As noted, a study16 of the first year of PPI treat-
ment
found
higher
rates
of
pneumonia
before
PPI
initiation, which biased posttreatment HR estimates. A
meta-analytical study17 suggested similar confounding as

 an explanation for the perceived link between PPIs and
pneumonia in the field. That study focused on effects of
PPIs in users of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
Using data from several databases and a high-dimensional
propensity-scoring approach, no statistically significantly
greater risk of hospitalization for pneumonia was found
except in one population in primary analysis. Our own
results suggest that although short-term PPI pneumonia
associations may be confounded, longer-term associations
in older adults in primary care were present and consistent
across a range of analysis approaches.
Clinical and research implications
Our findings support the need for caution in long-term
prescribing of PPIs to older adults. Further work is needed
to clarify indication biases in PPI prescribing, especially in
older adults hospitalized for pneumonia. Although appli-
cation of the PERR method strengthened our analysis,
observational designs provide less certain estimates than
well-conducted clinical trials and may suffer from residual
bias or confounding, although a randomized controlled
trial would have to be large, given that incident pneumo-
nia is relatively uncommon. Also, recruiting typical older
adults to clinical trials is challenging. Thus, observational
estimates in large representative populations based on
robust statistical methods are likely to provide valuable
estimates of effect (and are often the only available esti-
mates) for informing safe prescribing practice, especially
for older adults.
CONCLUSIONS
Pneumonia risk is greater with long-term PPI therapy in
older adults in primary care, independent of excess pneu-
monia rates immediately before first PPI receipt. In our
cohort, the excess risk was statistically similar across age
and comorbidity groups, but more work is needed to iden-
tify individuals at highest risk.
