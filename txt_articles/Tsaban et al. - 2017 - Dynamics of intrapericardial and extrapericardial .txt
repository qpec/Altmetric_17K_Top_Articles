ABSTRACT
Background: In view of evidence linking pericardial fat accumula-
tion with increased cardiovascular disease risk, strategies to reduce its
burden are needed. Data comparing the effects of specific long-term
dietary interventions on pericardial fat tissue mobilization are sparse.
Objective: We sought to evaluate intrapericardial-fat (IPF) and
extrapericardial-fat (EPF) changes during weight-loss interventions
by different dietary regimens.
Design: During 18 mo of a randomized controlled trial, we compared
a Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate (MED/LC) diet plus 28 g walnuts/d
with a calorically equal low-fat (LF) diet among randomly assigned
participants with moderate abdominal obesity. We performed whole-
body MRI and volumetrically quantified IPF and EPF among 80
participants to follow the 18-mo changes.
Results: The participants [mean age: 48.6 y; mean body mass
index (BMI; in kg/m2); 31.7; 90% men] had baseline IPF and
EPF (mean 6 SD) volumes of 172.4 6 53.3 mL and 194.9 6
71.5 mL, respectively. The 18-mo moderate weight loss of 3.7 kg
was similar in both groups, but the reduction in waist circumfer-
ence was higher in the MED/LC group (26.9 6 6.6 cm) than in
the LF diet group (22.3 6 6.5 cm; P = 0.01). After 18 mo, the
IPF volume had reduced twice as much in the MED/LC group
compared with the LF group [237 6 26.2 mL (222% 6 15%)
compared with 215.5 6 26.2 mL (28% 6 15%), respectively;
P , 0.05, after adjustment for changes in weight or visceral
adipose tissue]. The EPF volume had reduced similarly in both
groups [241.6 6 30.2 mL (223% 6 16%) in the MED/LC group
compared with 237.9 6 28.3 mL (219% 6 14%) in the LF
group; P . 0.1]. After controlling for weight loss, IPF and EPF
volume reduction paralleled changes in lipid profile but not with
improved glycemic profile variables: the IPF relative reduction
was associated with a decrease in triglycerides (TGs) (b = 0.090;
95% CI: 0.026, 0.154; P = 0.007) and the ratio of TGs to high-
density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (b = 2.689; 95% CI: 0.373,
5.003; P = 0.024), and the EPF relative reduction was associated
with an increase in HDL cholesterol (b = 20.452; 95% CI: 20.880,
20.023; P = 0.039) and a decrease in total cholesterol and HDL
cholesterol (b = 3.766; 95% CI: 1.092, 6.440; P = 0.007).
Conclusions: Moderate but persistent dietary-induced weight
loss substantially decreased both IPF and EPF volumes. Reduc-
tion of pericardial adipose tissues is independently associated
with an improved lipid profile. The Mediterranean diet, rich in
unsaturated fats and restricted carbohydrates, is superior to an
LF diet in terms of the IPF burden reduction. This trial was

INTRODUCTION
Pericardial fat, the ectopic fat surrounding the heart, consists
of 2 different fat compartments separated by the pericardium:
intrapericardial fat (IPF), i.e., epicardial fat, located between the
myocardium and visceral serous pericardium; and extrapericardial

 fat (EPF), which lies externally to the fibrous pericardium. These
fat tissues differ in their embryonic origin and blood supply (1, 2).
Whereas the accumulation of IPF is associated with an increased
risk of cardiovascular diseases (3–6), cardiac dysfunction (7–9),
and atrial fibrillation (10), EPF burden is associated with
obesity-related diseases, such as metabolic syndrome, dyslipi-
demia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (11, 12). Therefore, modu-
lation of these adipose tissues after weight loss and their relation
to cardiometabolic change and cardiovascular disease risk have
gained scientific interest.
Whereas some studies have shown a reduction in EPF only
after lifestyle-induced weight loss (13, 14) or insensitivity of
IPF to weight changes (15), other studies have shown a sub-
stantial change in IPF or total pericardial fat burden after weight
loss induced by diet (16–19), physical activity (PA) (20, 21), or
bariatric surgery (22–24). Yet, the differential (25) or nondiffer-
ential (21) effect of different weight loss strategies on the re-
duction of either IPF or EPF, independent from amount of weight
loss, is still unclear.
Currently, there is no widely accepted agreement on specific
dietary strategies that may improve the dynamics of pericardial
fat depots. Furthermore, it is unclear how changes in pericardial
fat tissues relate to changes in hemodynamic and cardiometabolic
profile during dietary weight-loss intervention. This is especially
of interest in light of evidence of improved cardiac function and
hemodynamics after dietary-induced weight loss (26), possibly
suggesting that pericardial fat might serve as a mediator in this
process.
Previously, we reported that Mediterranean/low-carbohydrate
(MED/LC) diets could be as effective as low-fat (LF) diets in
improving cardiometabolic risk (27) and in reversing athero-
sclerosis (28). Other trials have shown a Mediterranean diet to be
superior to an LF diet in primary and secondary prevention of
cardiovascular diseases (29, 30).
In this study, as part of a larger effort to determine the impact of
different lifestyle strategies for weight-loss on the redistribution
of fats in a variety of depots, we aimed to assess and compare the
18-mo effects of 2 isocaloric dietary regimens (a combined
MED/LC diet compared with an LF diet) on the dynamics of IPF
and EPF. We also sought to determine the changes in cardio-
metabolic risk variables that were associated with the dynamics
of pericardial fat depots.
Therefore, we performed whole-body MRI and volumetrically
quantified IPF and EPF among 80 participants to follow the
18-mo changes. Our a priori hypothesis was that IPF and EPF
volumes would reduce significantly, but not necessarily differ-
ently, under MED/LC and LF diets and that EPF volume changes
will be better associated with changes in cardiometabolic profile
than IPF volume changes would be.
METHODS
Study population and design
The randomized controlled CENTRAL trial (clinicaltrials.gov
Identifier: NCT01530724) was conducted between October 2012
and April 2014 in the Nuclear Research Center of the Negev, a
workplace with an onsite medical clinic. Two hundred seventy-
eight eligible participants were recruited based on the following
criteria: abdominal obesity [waist circumference (WC) $102 cm
for men and $88 cm for women] or a combination of high serum
TGs (.150 mg/dL) and low HDL cholesterol (,40 mg/dL for
men and ,50 mg/dL for women). Exclusion criteria were an
inability to start PA in the gym, current PA .3 times/wk, serum
TGs .400 mg/dL, serum creatinine $2 mg/dL, clinical assess-
ment of unlikeliness to complete the study, concomitant major
illness that might require hospitalization (on physician’s evalua-
tion), pregnancy or lactation, disturbed liver function ($2-fold
level of alanine-aminotransferase and aspartate-aminotransferase
enzymes), presence of active cancer or cancer within the last 3 y,
or participation in another intervention trial. The participants
provided written, informed consent, and this study was approved
by the human subjects committee of Soroka Medical Center and
Ben-Gurion University. Participants received no financial com-
ponent or gift.
For this substudy, 80 of the 278 eligible subjects of the
CENTRAL trial were double-blindly randomly selected to un-
dergo cardiac MRI before and after the intervention. After com-
pleting baseline measurements, we equally randomly assigned the
80 participants into 1 of 2 diet groups: LF or MED/LC. Ran-
domization for the entire study’s population was performed by a
computerized algorithm stratifying for inclusion in this substudy to
result in equal-sized study groups. After 6 mo of dieting,
participants of each dietary group were again randomly assigned
into either diet with PA or a diet-only intervention. A detailed
flowchart of the trial is illustrated in Figure 1.
Dietary intervention
Both diets aimed for an energy intake of 1500 kcal/d for women
and 1800 kcal/d for men, with restricted intakes of trans fats and
refined carbohydrates and an increased intake of vegetables.
Lunch, which is typically the main meal in Israel, was provided
exclusively by the workplace cafeteria during the work week.
A dietitian worked closely with the kitchen staff to adjust the
dishes to each specific diet group. The 18-mo dietary intervention
included a 90-min nutritional session in the workplace with
clinical dietitians every week during the first month of the in-
tervention and once every month thereafter. To maintain an equal
intensity of treatment, the workshop format and the quality of the
materials were similar across diet groups, except for the instruc-
tions and materials specific to each diet strategy. Text messages
were sent to update participants and to motivate their adherence
to the diets on specific occasions, such as upcoming celebratory
events or holidays. Participants who did not attend nutritional
sessions were subsequently contacted by phone.
LF diet
For the LF diet, based on the American Heart Association
guidelines (31), the aim was to limit total fat intake to 30% of
calories, #10% of saturated fat, and #300 mg cholesterol/d and
to increase dietary fiber. Participants were counseled to consume
whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and legumes and to limit their
consumption of additional fats, sweets, and high-fat snacks.
MED/LC diet
The MED/LC diet combined the Mediterranean and low-
carbohydrate diets described in the DIRECT trial (27); the
diet restricted carbohydrate intake (,40 g/d in the first 2 mo, and

 thereafter a gradual increase to #70 g/d) and increased protein
and fat intake, mostly from vegetarian sources, according to the
Mediterranean diet (27, 32). The MED/LC diet was rich in
vegetables and legumes and low in red meat, with poultry and
fish replacing beef and lamb. This group was also provided with
28 g walnuts/d [160 kcal, 84% fat, mostly PUFA (omega-3 a-
linolenic acid)].
Anthropometry and laboratory measurements
Blood and urine samples were taken after a 12-h fast. The
blood samples were centrifuged and stored at 2808C. All lipid,
glycemic, and inflammatory biomarkers (listed in Table 1) were
evaluated simultaneously in the Leipzig University laboratory,
Germany. Fasting plasma glucose was measured by using Roche
GLUC 3 (hexokinase method). Plasma insulin was measured
with an enzyme immunometric assay [Immulite automated an-
alyzer; Diagnostic Products; CV: 2.5%]. Serum total cholesterol
(TC; CV: 1.3%), HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and TGs
(CV: 2.1%) were determined enzymatically with a Cobas 6000
automatic analyzer (Roche). Height was measured to the nearest
millimeter with the use of a standard wall-mounted stadiometer.
Body weight was measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 kg.
WC was measured half-way between the last rib and the iliac
crest to the nearest millimeter by using a standard procedure
with the use of a 150-cm anthropometric measuring tape. Blood
pressure was determined by using an automated system (Data-
scope Acutor 4) after 5 min of rest.
Electronic questionnaires
Participants were interviewed with the use of a validated
electronic questionnaire compiled of a validated food-frequency
questionnaire (33), which includes 127 food items and 3 portion-
size pictures for 17 selected food items, and a PA questionnaire
that was converted into metabolic equivalents. The electronic
interface of the questionnaires ensured that every question was
fully answered.

 MRI
Whole-body MRI was performed by using a 3T scanner
(Ingenia; Philips Medical Systems). The thorax was imaged in a
2-block scan by using a 2-point modified-DIXON technique
(34), a 3-dimensional T1-Fast-Field-Echo sequence with the use
of multiple acquired echoes to generate water, in-phase, out-of-
phase, and fat-only images automatically. Scans were performed
in a single-shot, breath-hold sequence by using cardiac gating
detected by the vector cardiac gating technique (Vector Cardiac
gating; Philips Medical Systems). This imaging protocol for the
quantification of pericardial fat was described and validated by
another group (35) but does not include cine imaging for
structural or functional assessment of the heart. Readers were
blinded to the allocated intervention and acquisition time.
Quantification of IPF and EPF
Pericardial fat was analyzed from the of the pulmonary trunk to
the level of the apex of the heart in cross-sectional axial view.
Raw imaging data were reconstructed into slices (slice thickness,
5 mm; slice gap, 0 mm; slice overlap, 1 mm). By using a semi-
automated MATLAB-based program, the first slice for each
subject was used to determine the fat-recognition sensitivity
threshold for the specific series analysis. This was done by using
a region-of-interest method with a fixed-sized 2 3 2–pixel circle
constantly placed in the aortic recess, just anterior to the con-
junction between the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk
emerging from the ventricles. Upper and lower threshold values
were set as 2.5 SDs from the average region-of-interest set
value. By using the threshold-index, fat was automatically de-
tected on each slice. We distinguished IPF and EPF by iden-
tifying and drawing a polygon along the pericardium. Fat
surrounding internal thoracic vessels, the aorta, the posterior
part of esophagus, and the peridiaphragmatic area was excluded
from the analysis. Pericardial adipose tissues were first mea-
sured in area (cm2); fat volumes were calculated by multiplying
the total measured fat area by slice thickness. All imaging ac-
quisition and quantification for all time points were performed in
the same manner by using the same anatomical reference points
and landmarks as detailed above. The entire process of imaging
analyses was performed by 2 specifically trained readers, trained
and supervised by a cardiac imaging specialist doctor with 10 y
of experience (AW), who also reviewed analyses and confirmed
their appropriateness. Reliability of measurements between and
within rates was measured by using Bland-Altman analysis,
including 14 full analyses accounting for 280 image slices, with

 an overall interclass correlation of 0.98 (0.95 for IPF, 0.99 for
EPF; P , 0.05 for all) and intraclass correlation of 0.97 (0.94
for IPF, 0.97 for EPF; P , 0.05 for all).
Quantification of abdominal fat depots
The MRI scanner used a 3-dimesional modified DIXON
imaging technique without gaps (2-mm thickness and 2-mm
spacing), a fast-low-angle shot sequence with a multi-echo 2-
excitation pulse sequence for phase-sensitive encoding of fat and
water signals (repetition time 3.6 ms; echo time 1,1.19 ms;
second echo time 2.3 ms; field of view 520 3 440 3 80 mm; 2 3
1.4 3 1 mm voxel size). Four images of the phantoms were
generated, including in phase, out of phase, fat phase, and water
phase. A breath-hold technique was used to prevent motion ar-
tifacts when the chest and abdomen were scanned. All MRI tests
were performed after at least a 2-h fast. In all simultaneous
quantifications and comparisons of fat depots, observers were
blinded to time point and group treatment.
Abdominal fat was quantified by using MATLAB-based semi-
automatic software that was written inhouse (36, 37). To obtain
the distribution of abdominal subdepots, 3 slices were selected
from the intravertebral space of L5–S1, L4–L5, and L2–L3 from
both sagittal and axial images. A continuous line was drawn
over the superficialis fascia to differentiate, by analyzing the
2-dimensional image, between the deep subcutaneous adipose
tissue (SAT) and superficial SAT. Mean visceral adipose tissue
(VAT), deep SAT, and superficial SAT were calculated from 3
axial slices. After quantification, fat tissues were divided into
color-coded groups: superficial SAT fat was dark blue, deep-
SAT fat was light blue, VAT was green, perimuscular fat (fat
surrounding and within the latissimus dorsi and diaphragm) was
purple, and nonclassified fat (fat surrounding the vertebrae and
fat depots unrelated to any of the groups listed above) was red.
Quantification of the fat mass regions included the area of
each fat type and its proportion (percentage) of the total area
of all fat types. To obtain absolute measurements in metric
units, a scaling procedure was applied before the segmenta-
tion to determine the real pixel dimensions. A comparison of
2-dimensional analysis with 3-dimensional analysis for 30
scans showed the 2-dimensional analysis to be highly accurate
(r = 0.97, P = 0.001).
Statistical analysis
Our specific aim in this CENTRAL substudy was to assess
changes in IPF and EPF volumes between baseline and the end of
the dietary intervention at 18 mo. Power calculations are detailed
in Supplemental Material. Baseline data were examined across
sex-specific tertiles of pericardial fat by comparing the highest
tertile of EPF and IPF volumes with rest of study population and
with the lowest tertile of EPF or IPF volumes. Furthermore,
baseline associations between IPF and EPF volumes and other
variables were examined by using Pearson’s or Spearman’s
correlation coefficient according to each variable’s distribution.
The 18-mo changes in pericardial fat tissues were evaluated by
using per-protocol and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses (including
all the study’s population regardless of reason for withdrawal
from the study), for within and between intervention groups. IPF
and EPF changes across intervention groups were assessed by
using a 2-on-2 factorial univariate-mean-of-differences model,
including both dietary intervention groups (LF and MED/LC,
i.e., the major intervention) and PA (i.e., the secondary in-
tervention), and testing for interaction between the 2 in-
terventions. We further examined IPF and EPF changes across
study’s subgroups in linear regression models including all
subgroups as independent variables, with the LF diet-only group
(LFPA2) used as a reference. The 18-mo associations between
the EPF and IPF relative changes with changes in other variables
were analyzed by using multivariate linear regression models
controlling for potential confounders. All P values were 2-sided,
and P , 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were performed with the use of SPSS software Version
21 (SPSS). Values are expressed as means 6 SDs.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of main outcome variables
Baseline characteristics of the study population across in-
tervention groups are exhibited in Table 1. The age was 48.1 6
8.6 y, and 72 of the 80 participants (90%) were men. Baseline
weight was 94.7 6 13.5 kg, with a median BMI of 31.2 (range:
29.1–33.9) and a WC of 109 6 10.2 cm2. The initial VAT
proportion was 32.3% 6 10.4%, the IPF volume was 172.4 6
53.3 mL, and the EPF volume was 194.9 6 71.5 mL. In-
tervention groups did not differ significantly across a wide range
of variables.
Baseline characteristics across sex-specific tertiles of peri-
cardial fat tissues are shown in Table 2.
EPF and IPF volumes were highly correlated (r = 0.74,
P , 0.001). Older age, greater VAT area, and higher concentra-
tions of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were related to higher
volumes of both EPF and IPF. Obesity markers (WC, weight, and
BMI) and deep subcutaneous adiposity were more strongly linked
with elevated EPF volumes than IPF volumes.
Adherence to dietary intervention and weight loss
The retention rate was 82% at 6 mo and 77% at 18 mo and was
similar across dietary intervention groups (P = 0.12). Participants
who withdrew from the intervention did not differ in de-
mographics or anthropometrics across dietary groups. At base-
line, there were no significant differences in the consumption of
energy or macronutrients between the LF and MED/LC diet
groups. After the intervention, participants significantly de-
creased their energy intake after 6 and 18 mo (P , 0.01 com-
pared with baseline); this was similar across diet groups. The
intake of the total carbohydrates proportion significantly de-
creased, and the intake of total monounsaturated and poly-
unsaturated fat proportions significantly increased in the
MED/LC diet group at 6 and 18 mo compared with the LF diet
group (P , 0.05 for all), demonstrating adherence to the as-
signed diets. Energy and macronutrient consumptions at base-
line and throughout intervention are detailed in Supplemental
Table 1.
At the end of intervention, after 18 mo of dieting, participants
lost 3.6 6 6.9 kg (22.4 6 7.7 kg in LF group and 25.0 6 5.7 kg
in MED/LC group, P = 0.2 between groups) and had a decrease
of 3.6% from baseline body weight. WC decreased by 4.4 6

 group (26.9 6 6.6 cm) than in the LF group (22.3 6 6.5 cm),
P = 0.01. HDL cholesterol increased similarly in the 2 diet
groups (+3.1 6 8.4 in the LF group compared with +5.1 6 7.4
in the MED/LC group, P = 0.307). Generally, at the end of the
intervention, the MED/LC group had an improved lipid profile
compared with the LF group for TC (+15.3 6 37.6 mg/dL in the
LF group compared with 29.5 6 48.1 mg/dL in the MED/LC
group, P = 0.023), LDL cholesterol (+11.7 6 25.2 mg/dL in the
LF group compared with 28.2 6 41.2 mg/dL in the MED/LC
group, P = 0.022), and serum TGs (+2.6 6 65.2 mg/dL in the LF
group compared with 216.9 6 37.3 mg/dL in the MED/LC group,
P = 0.028). Further changes in anthropometry, hemodynamics,
and serum biomarkers across dietary intervention groups are de-
tailed in Supplemental Table 2.
Changes in pericardial fat during intervention
EPF volumes were reduced substantially during the inter-
vention from 194.9 6 71.5 mL at baseline to 165.2 6 73.3 mL at
18 mo, a 15% decrease; IPF volume decreased by 11%, from
172.4 6 53.3 mL to 153.6 6 55.0 mL; P , 0.001 for both
compared with baseline both in per-protocol and in ITT analy-
ses. Sample images of pericardial fat changes in 2 men, one
with a 1.2-kg weight loss and the other with 20-kg loss, are
shown in Figure 2A, B.
Across the dietary intervention groups, the MED/LC diet had
a favorable effect over the LF diet in reduction of IPF volume
(237 6 26.2 mL compared with 215.5 6 26.2 mL, P = 0.002,
among completers or 225 6 27.7 mL compared with 212.8 6
24.5 mL among the ITT population, P = 0.04) which remained
significant also after adjustment for age, inclusion in the PA in-
tervention, changes in metabolic equivalents, and 18-mo weight
change, BMI change, or VAT change separately (Figure 3).
Conversely, the EPF volume had reduced similarly in both
groups (241.6 6 30.2 mL in the MED/LC group compared with
237.9 6 28.3 mL in the LF group; P . 0.1 both in per-protocol
and ITT analyses). An example of the differential influence of
dietary intervention in 2 individuals with similar weight loss
in the 2 diets is illustrated in Figure 4.
There was no statistically significant interaction between di-
etary and PA interventions (P = 0.172). Across the 4 study
subgroups (LF and MED/LC diets with or without PA), the LF
diet-only (LFPA2) group had the smallest reduction in IPF vol-
ume (214.2 6 32.3 mL) compared with the MED/LC group
with PA (MED/LCPA+), which had the greatest reduction in
IPF (239.5 6 26.2 mL, P = 0.01). Differences between other
groups were not significant: MED/LC diet-only (MED/LCPA2):
233.3 6 27.2 mL, P = 0.075 compared with LFPA2); LFPA+:
216.6 6 20.7 mL, P = 0.797 compared with LFPA2). EPF was
reduced similarly in all study subgroups (LFPA2: 236.0 6
30.2 mL; LFPA+: 239.5 6 27.4 mL; MED/LCPA2: 249.0 6
23.3 mL; MED/LCPA+ group: 236.5 6 33.9 mL; P . 0.05 for
all comparisons).
Association between 18-mo changes in pericardial fat with
changes in anthropometrics and cardiometabolic variables
Linear regression models for the association between 18-mo
changes in IPF and EPF with changes in anthropometrics and
cardiometabolic markers after 18 mo of intervention are detailed
in Table 3. To assess whether the IPF or EPF changes merely
reflected VAT redistribution or modification in body mass or
had associations beyond such changes, we additionally adjusted
each model to the 18-mo changes of VAT and BMI separately.
After adjustment to the 18-mo change in BMI, the reduction in
IPF remained significantly associated with a decrease in WC
(b = 0.364, P = 0.030), serum TG dynamics (b = 0.308,
P = 0.007), and serum ratio of TG to HDL cholesterol
(b = 0.257, P = 0.024). Similarly, the EPF change remained
significantly associated with increased serum HDL cholesterol
(b = 20.262, P = 0.039) and an improved serum ratio of TC to
HDL cholesterol (b = 0.334, P = 0.007). Models adjusting for
the VAT change showed generally similar results (Table 3). In
sensitivity analyses similar associations were observed in both
dietary intervention groups and PA intervention groups.
DISCUSSION
In this 18-mo trial among participants with abdominal obesity,
we found that moderate, but persistent, dietary-induced weight

1.2 kg weight loss during 18 mo of intervention. This subject had a mild
reduction in both IPF (light blue) and EPF (royal blue), and slice analyses
reveal little, if any, pericardial adiposity change. (B) Three paired slices from
the same heights as panel A of a subject with a 20-kg loss. This subject had
a substantial reduction in both EPF (royal blue) and IPF (light blue). Both
subjects were in their early 40s and had a similar baseline biophysical pro-

 loss substantially decreased both IPF and EPF volumes. Addi-
tionally, we observed a differential effect of dietary interventions
on IPF volume changes: the MED/LC diet induced almost twice
as much IPF volume reduction as the LF diet did. Importantly,
these differences were discernable even after adjusting for the
decline in VAT or BMI. The IPF and EPF volume reduction
paralleled changes in lipid variables but not the glycemic profile.
To our knowledge, this report is the first to show differential
effects of diet on IPF beyond weight reduction.
Pericardial fat redistribution after weight reduction was pre-
viously addressed in trials among #40 participants with maximal
intervention lengths of 6 mo (13–19, 21–23, 25). Most of these
studies reported a statistically significant reduction in IPF, EPF,
or both pericardial fat depots after weight reduction (13–24).
These studies described a high correlation between pericardial
adipose tissue reduction and mild-to-moderate weight loss (18,
25). Also, pericardial fat volume reduction achieved after a 16-wk,
very-low-calorie diet remained stable after an additional 14 mo

in their 40s with similar anthropometrics at baseline and similar reductions in weight (w2.5%) at the end of the intervention. The participant in the MED/Low-carb
diet group had a 44% IPF (light blue) volume reduction, whereas the participant in the LF group had a 15% reduction. EPF (royal blue) volume reduction was also
more substantial in the MED/Low-carb participant than in the LF participant, although it was less profound than the IPF volume reduction. EPF, extrapericardial

 of follow-up (16). In our trial, moderate weight loss that was
sustained for 18 mo substantially reduced pericardial fat burden.
We further aimed to examine whether pericardial fat could
be differentially influenced by diet by comparing a MED/LC
diet with an LF diet (31). A prior study among women that
examined the effects of 20 wk of similarly hypocaloric lifestyle
interventions on pericardial fat showed a significant, but
similar, reduction in pericardial fat volume in all intervention
groups (21). Therefore, our a priori assumption was that both
IPF and EPF volumes would decline significantly but similarly
in both dietary intervention groups, in correspondence with
overall weight loss. Contrary to expectation, we found that after
18 mo, the IPF volume reduction was highly sensitive to the
dietary intervention, beyond the influence of weight loss,
whereas the EPF volume reduction was similar across dietary
interventions, influenced by weight loss alone.
Because of its intimate relation to the myocardium and
coronary arteries, IPF, originating from the same embryonic
origin as abdominal VAT (1, 2), has long been studied for its
role in coronary atherosclerosis and cardiac hemodynamics
and structure. IPF’s high free fatty acid (FFA) uptake and
turnover serves as an important energy source for the myo-
cardium and paracrinely affects coronary vessels and the
myocardium contractility (2, 6). Our findings of associations
between higher weight, abdominal visceral adiposity, and in-
creased volumes of IPF at baseline match observations from
past cross-sectional studies (3, 4, 7). Previous reports also
linked increased IPF burden with coronary artery obstructive
disease and decreased left ventricular function (7, 9). Hence,
there is growing interest in defining feasible weight-loss
strategies to effectively reduce IPF burden.
So far, reported pericardial volumes were highly variable
and represented mixed-sex populations mostly in the normal
range of BMI. In our study, baseline IPF volumes were higher
than those reported in studies among mixed populations (3, 35)
yet are well in line with reported IPF volumes in obese and
metabolically impaired populations (38). These differences in
baseline IPF volumes may also derive from the high percentage
of men in our study.
The marked reduction in IPF with the MED/LC diet might
be explained by several mechanistic hypotheses. Recent evi-
dence suggests bidirectional, paracrine-type cross-talk between
the myocardium and IPF, supported by the finding that IPF
can infiltrate, and become tightly interconnected with, certain
regions of the myocardium: myocardial lipid oxidation prod-
ucts modulate IPF adiponectin secretion via peroxisome
proliferator–activated receptor g, and in turn, IPF-produced
adiponectin decreases myocardial oxidative stress, constituting
a bidirectional regulatory feedback loop (39). As well, atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP), secreted from atrial cardiomyocytes,
was shown to exhibit a lipolytic effect on epicardial adipocytes
(40) and decrease oxidative stress (41). Because poly-
morphism in ANP was associated with cardiometabolic pro-
tection in both North American (42) and Mediterranean
populations (43), we suggest future studies to investigate a
putative mediatory role of ANP in the link between lifestyle
intervention, IPF trajectory, and improved cardiometabolic
health. From another perspective, IPF and the myocardium
share the same blood supply via coronary circulation (6).
Because the myocardium was shown to exhibit high FFA

 uptake activity (44), it is plausible that FFA released from IPF
can contribute to myocardial FFA uptake (6). Nevertheless, to
date, whether delivery of FFA from IPF to the myocardium
occurs via the coronary circulation or via direct diffusion has not
been established. Thus, future studies should explore whether
the preferential decrease in IPF in response to the MED/LC diet
is mediated by greater induction of IPF lipolysis, and if so, what
might be the role of enhanced secretion of myocardium-derived
prolipolytic factors, such as ANP, and/or whether an MED/LC
diet can enhance myocardial capacity to use IPF-released FFA.
A reduction in the ratio of TG to HDL cholesterol, a biomarker
for the identification of insulin resistance associated with elevated
cardiometabolic risk (45), was associated with a reduction in IPF.
This finding, along with the reported association between in-
creased IPF burden and increased cardiovascular disease risk
(3–6), might reflect a potential link between the ratio of TG to
HDL cholesterol, IPF burden, and cardiometabolic risk.
In contrast to IPF, EPF has mainly been related to increased
metabolic risk and decline in insulin sensitivity and only weakly
linked with coronary artery obstructive disease and cardiac
dysfunction (5, 11, 12). EPF was not independently associated
with increased cardiovascular disease risk but rather through
its association with other cardiometabolic risk factors (1, 6). In
this trial, EPF reduction was associated with improved HDL
cholesterol and ratio of TC to HDL cholesterol but not with
glycemic profile changes, after adjusting for changes in BMI or
VAT. These findings suggest that EPF might play a role in
dyslipidemia (5, 6, 11, 12).
Limitations of our study should be considered. Most par-
ticipants were men, so we cannot draw specific conclusions re-
garding women. Also, we had no direct assessment of coronary
obstructive disease, vascular atherosclerosis, or cardiac function.
Our volumetric method to assess pericardial fat volumes was not
directly validated by our group but was independently validated
by another group (35). Nevertheless, we achieved high re-
producibility with high interclass and intraclass correlation co-
efficients; furthermore, all imaging analyses were performed in
the same manner, which mitigates potential minor inaccuracies in
assessing changes in pericardial fat volumes. Although our study
was the largest of its kind, the sample size was limited.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated a favorable reduction in
IPF volume with the MED/LC diet compared with the LF diet,
even after adjustment for changes in VAT or BMI. The reduction
in EPF correlated with a better cholesterol balance, whereas
decreases in IPF were associated with reductions in serum TGs
and ratio of TG to HDL cholesterol. Because IPF has been related
to the risk of coronary artery atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
disease, our findings might imply that IPF changes play a role in
mediating the benefits of the MED/LC diets compared with an LF
diet. Our findings, along with other reports, might suggest that
IPF serves as a surrogate, linking between body mass, visceral
adiposity, metabolic state, and cardiovascular disease risk.
