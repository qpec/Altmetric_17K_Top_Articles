OBJECTIVE
“Clinical inertia” has been used to describe the delay in the intensification of
type 2 diabetes treatment among patients with poor glycemic control. Previous
studies may have exaggerated the prevalence of clinical inertia by failing to ade-
quately monitor drug dose changes and nonmedication interventions. This project
evaluated the intensification of diabetes therapy and hemoglobin A1c (A1C) goal
attainment among patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes when metfor-
min monotherapy failed.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The electronic health record at Cleveland Clinic was used to identify patients with
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes between 2005 and 2013 who failed to reach the
A1C goal after 3 months of metformin monotherapy. A time-dependent survival
analysis was used to compare the time until A1C goal attainment in patients who
received early intensification of therapy (within 6 months of metformin failure) or
late intensification. The analysis was performed for A1C goals of 7% (n = 1,168),
7.5% (n = 679), and 8% (n = 429).
RESULTS
Treatment was intensified early in 62%, 69%, and 72% of patients when poor
glycemic control was defined as an A1C >7%, >7.5%, and >8%, respectively. The
probability of undergoing an early intensification was greater the higher the A1C
category. Time until A1C goal attainment was shorter among patients who re-
ceived early intensification regardless of the A1C goal (all P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS
A substantial number of patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes fail to
undergo intensification of therapy within 6 months of metformin monotherapy
failure. Early intervention in patients when metformin monotherapy failed
resulted in more rapid attainment of A1C goals.

CLIN CARE/EDUCATION/NUTRITION/PSYCHOSOCIAL
 Despite clinical practice guidelines that
recommend frequent monitoring of he-
moglobin A1c (A1C) and aggressive esca-
lation of antidiabetic therapies to reach
glycemic targets (1,2), research using
the United States National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey database
reported that from 2007 to 2010, only
52.5% of people with diabetes achieved
an A1C of ,7.0% (3). Metformin, in the
absence of contraindications or intoler-
ability, is generally the recommended
first-line therapy to manage hyperglyce-
mia in patients with type 2 diabetes
(1,2). However, further intensification
of therapy, with the initiation of addi-
tional antidiabetic medication, is often
inappropriately delayed. Recent studies
revealed that the median time to treat-
ment intensification among those in
whom metformin monotherapy failed
exceeded 1 year and that the median
time to treatment intensification was
14.0 months overall (4).
There are many challenges in achiev-
ing glycemic targets in patients with
type 2 diabetes: the progressive deteri-
oration in blood glucose control related
to ongoing b-cell failure (5,6), the lack of
medications that address all of the un-
derlying pathophysiologic defects of
type 2 diabetes (7), poor glycemic dura-
bility among the antidiabetic agents
(8,9), and patient-related factors, in-
cluding concern about the potential for
medication-related adverse effects (10),
medication complexity, tolerability,
and/or affordability (8,11), and poor ad-
herence to lifestyle modifications (8).
Clinical inertia (failure to initiate or in-
tensify therapy when indicated) also ap-
pears to be a very strong driving force
behind the failure to obtain glycemic
control (12). According to Phillips et al.
(13), clinical inertia is due to at least
three problems: overestimation of care
provided, use of “soft” reasons to avoid
intensification of therapy, and lack of ed-
ucation, training, and practice organiza-
tion aimed at achieving therapeutic
goals.
Although the time to treatment in-
tensification and/or lack of intensifica-
tion when clinically indicated (clinical
inertia) has been studied in the overall
prevalent population of patients with
type 2 diabetes (4), there are no data
in the literature regarding this topic in
patients with newly diagnosed type 2 di-
abetes. Guidelines are clear on the need
to aggressively intensify therapy in pa-
tients with newly diagnosed type 2 di-
abetes toget tothe A1C goal,but patients
and physicians may feel less urgency early
in the course of the disease. The objec-
tives of this study were to evaluate the
prevalence of clinical inertia, identify fac-
tors associated with clinical inertia, and
quantify the time until intensification
and time until A1C control in patients
with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes
who did not achieve glycemic targets
after at least 3 months of metformin
monotherapy.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Data Source
The enterprise-wide electronic health
record (EHR) system at Cleveland Clinic
was used to identify patients with newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Cleveland
Clinic uses EPIC My Practice across the
entire organization (installed in 1998).
The EHR includes patient demographics;
social, medical, family, and surgical his-
tory; vital signs; imaging data and pa-
thology reports; and rich longitudinal
clinical data (diagnosis, procedures,
etc.) from inpatient and outpatient re-
cords. It contains discrete data linkage
with Cleveland Clinic laboratory records
and detailed information on medication
use information. In 2014, Cleveland
Clinic set a new annual record for out-
patient visits (almost 6 million), and
has .1 million active patients ($2 en-
counters within the past 12 months).
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
From 2005 to 2013, patients with newly
diagnosed diabetes were identified by
requiring at least two office encounters
with a primary care provider or endo-
crinologist within the Cleveland Clinic
Health System before the first struc-
tured diagnosis of diabetes (ICD-9 code
250.xx). This requirement helped to limit
the inclusion of patients with preexisting
diabetes who were being referred to
Cleveland Clinic specifically for diabetes
management. Excluded were patients
with any structured evidence of diabetes
.12 months before the date ofdiagnosis,
determined by antidiabetic medication,
ICD-9 code, or laboratory values consis-
tent with having diabetes (elevated fast-
ing or random blood glucose or elevated
A1C). In a further attempt to exclude pa-
tients who potentially may have been re-
ceiving diabetes care elsewhere, patients
in whomthetimebetweenthesecondpre-
diagnosis of diabetes encounter and the
subsequent diagnosis of diabetes was $2
years were excluded. Also excluded were
patients without a subsequent outpatient
encounter for type 2 diabetes after the
date of diagnosis within the EHR, patients
with documentation of an ICD9 code spe-
cific for type 1 diabetes at any time, and
patients with gestational diabetes.
The study population was further re-
stricted to patients with newly diag-
nosed type 2 diabetes who received at
least 3 months of first-line metformin
monotherapy.ThefirstA1Cafter3months
of metformin monotherapy was recorded
as the initial/baseline A1C. If the initial/
baseline A1C exceeded 1 year after the
end of the 3-month course of metformin
monotherapy, the patient was excluded
because the patient was assumed to be
lost to follow-up and was no longer be-
ing managed at the Cleveland Clinic. Be-
cause the baseline A1C is a measure of
the effectiveness of the metformin
monotherapy, the patient had to be
on metformin monotherapy until the
first A1C measurement and was ex-
cluded if any additional antidiabetic
medication was added before the initial/
baseline A1C assessment. Clinical inertia
was defined as a lack of intervention
within 6 months after an elevated base-
line A1C (.7%, .7.5%, or .8%).
Statistical Analysis
A cross-sectional summary of patient char-
acteristics was made for the entire cohort
and then stratified by the baseline A1C
category .7% (53 mmol/mol), .7.5%
(58 mmol/mol), and .8% (64 mmol/mol).
Separate Kaplan-Meier analyses were
performed for time until intervention
for patients with baseline A1C .7%
(n = 1,168), .7.5% (n = 679), and .8%
(n = 429). These three discrete A1C cut
points were chosen for evaluation to try
to avoid overestimating the prevalence
of clinical inertia because many patients
may have had a higher A1C target (.7%),
in line with recent guidelines that have
recommendedanindividualizedapproach
to diabetes management. “Intervention”
included the addition of antidiabetic med-
ication, prescription for a weight loss med-
ication, change in metformin dose or
regimen, or referral to a dietitian or nutri-
tionist. The log-rank test was used to eval-
uatethedifferencebetweeneachstratified
level within the Kaplan-Meier plots.

Intensification of Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, September 2016
 Time-dependent Cox regression anal-
yses were constructed for time until A1C
goal attainment. Because different pa-
tients may have different but appropri-
ate A1C goals, the analysis was repeated
for A1C goals of 7%, 7.5%, and 8%. A
time-dependent analysis was used to
account for the heterogeneity in the
elapsed time between the initial A1C
measurementandthe initialintervention.
To control for potential confounding var-
iables in the relationship between early
intervention and goal attainment, the
Cox models included the covariates of
age, race, sex, the Deyo-modified Charlson
comorbidity index, the number of active
nondiabetic medications, smoking sta-
tus, and the number of preventative ex-
aminations of baseline A1C within the
past 3 years. Because the time of the
intervention occurs after the initial A1C,
the intervention is therefore dependent
on follow-up time and incorporated
into a Coxregressionas atime-dependent
variable. Without this adjustment, there
would be a bias of shorter follow-up
times being associated with earlier
interventions.
To identify factors/patient character-
istics that were associated with clinical
inertia, descriptive statistics for the
groups with and without inertia were
compared using x2 tests for the cate-
gorical variables and the Wilcoxon sign
rank test for the continuous variables.
Record Review
A record review was conducted of
20 random patients with identified clin-
ical inertia to determine the patient and
physician contributions to the develop-
ment of clinical inertia and to identify
the reasons an intensification of therapy
failed to occur when indicated. The pa-
tients’ entire EHR was reviewed, with a
particular focus on the information con-
tained within the free-text progress
notes and compliance with provider
appointments.
RESULTS
From 2005 to 2013, 5,239 patients met
the outlined inclusion and exclusion cri-
teria: having newly diagnosed type 2 di-
abetes and having been treated with
metformin monotherapy for at least
3 months. The patient population was
;50% female, 77% Caucasian, and 14%
smokers, and 77% had private or Medicare
insurance. The median age was 58 years.
Patients with a baseline A1C .8% tended
to be younger, male, and non-Caucasian.
Table 1 provides the descriptive statistics
for the entire cohort.
Baseline A1C Assessment
The median (interquartile range [IQR])
baseline A1C (first A1C within 1 year af-
ter being on a metformin monotherapy
for at least 3 months) for the entire co-
hort (N = 5,239) was 6.4% (6.0, 6.9)
(46 mmol/mol [42, 52]). The number
(%) of patients with a baseline A1C
.7%, .7.5%, and . 8%, were 1,168
(22%), 679 (13%), and 429 (8%), re-
spectively. The median (IQR) baseline
A1C for those patients with a baseline
A1C .7%, .7.5%, or .8% who under-
went an early intervention was 7.9%
(7.3, 9.0) (63 mmol/mol [56, 75]), 8.5%
(7.9, 9.9) (69 mmol/mol [63, 85]), and
9.2% (8.5, 10.8) (77 mmol/mol [69,
95]), respectively. The median (IQR)
baseline A1C for those patients with a
baseline A1C .7%, .7.5%, or .8% who
underwent a late (or no) intervention
was 7.5% (7.2, 8.1) (58 mmol/mol [55,
65]), 8.2% (7.8, 9.4) (66 mmol/mol [62,
79]), and 9.2% (8.4, 10.2) (77 mmol/mol
[68, 88]), respectively. The median (IQR)
time until baseline A1C assessment was
2.8 months (1.0, 6.0). Table 2 summa-
rizes the data provided.
Follow-up A1C Assessment
The vast majority of patients had a
follow-up A1C measurement (4,686 of
5,239 [89%]), defined as the first A1C
after the baseline A1C. The median
(IQR) time to follow-up A1C for the en-
tire cohort was 5.9 months (3.7, 9.3).
The median (IQR) time to follow-up
A1C assessment in those patients with
a baseline A1C .7%, .7.5% and .8%
was 5.0 (3.2, 8.6), 4.9 (3.1, 9.0), and
5.0 months (3.1, 9.3), respectively. The
median (IQR) follow-up A1C level in
those patients who underwent an early
intervention, with a baseline A1C .7%,
.7.5%, and .8%, was 7.4% (6.9, 8.5)
(57 mmol/mol [52, 69]), 7.8% (7.1, 9.3)
(62 mmol/mol [54, 78]), and 8.3% (7.3,
9.8) (67 mmol/mol [56, 84]). The median
(IQR) follow-up A1C level in those pa-
tients who underwent a late (or no) in-
tervention with a baseline A1C .7%,
.7.5%, and .8% was 7.4% (6.9, 8.5)
(57 mmol/mol [52, 69]), 8.1% (7.1, 9.3)
(65 mmol/mol [54, 78]), and 8.7% (7.3,
10.0)(72 mmol/mol[56, 86]), respectively
(Table 2). The vast majority of patients,
4,138 (79%), also had a return visit
with a primary care provider or endocri-
nologist within the Cleveland Clinic Health
System.
Time From Baseline A1C
Measurement Until Time
of Intervention
The median time until intervention in the
overallcohort was 1.18 years (;14months).
The percentage of patients with a base-
line A1C .7%, .7.5%, and .8% who
experienced clinical inertia (did not re-
ceive an intervention within 6 months
of a baseline elevated A1C) was 38%,
31%, and 28%, respectively. Figure 1
shows the Kaplan-Meier curves for the
time until intervention according to the
different A1C cutoffs.
Patientswith higherbaselineA1C levels
were more likely to receive an additional
medication as the initial intervention. Ta-
ble 3 reports the types of initial interven-
tions according to baseline A1C.
Analysis of Time Until A1C Was
Under Control
The time until A1C was under control was
evaluated based on the initial/baseline
A1C category after at least 3 months of
metformin monotherapy (.7%, .7.5%,
.8%) and then stratified into two subsets
of patients: those who were observed to
undergo an early intervention (#6 months
of the initial/baseline A1C) or late inter-
vention (.6 months or never). Across all
A1C categories, patients who underwent
an early intervention had a lower proba-
bility of not having their A1C under control
versus those who underwent a late or no
intervention. (Fig. 2). In the adjusted time-
dependent model, patients who under-
went an early intervention had a lower
probability of not having their A1C under
control versus those who underwent a
late or no intervention (initial/baseline
A1C .7%: hazard ratio [HR] 0.57, 95% CI
0.22–0.91, P = 0.001; initial/baseline
A1C .7.5%: HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.05–0.44,
P = 0.01; initial/baseline A1C .8%: HR
0.25, 95% CI 0.00–0.49, P = 0.04).
Factors Associated With Clinical
Inertia
The 443 patients (38%) who experi-
enced clinical inertia, that is, did not un-
dergo an intervention within 6 months
of the elevated baseline A1C (.7%) ver-
sus the 725 (62%) who underwent early
intervention, were slightly older, with a
median (IQR) age of 56.0 (46.6, 64.8) vs.

 54.2 (47.0, 61.3) years (P = 0.038). No dif-
ferences were observed for the following
patient characteristics/variables between
the patients who underwent early versus
late (or no) intervention: race, insurance
status (Medicaid, Medicare, or private),
smoking status, Diabetes Complication
and Severity Index, estimated glomerular
filtration rate, Deyo-modified Charlson
comorbidity index, number of active
nondiabetes-related prescription medica-
tions, preventative examinations within
the past 3 years, history of coronary artery
disease, cerebral vascular accident, heart
failure, or hypertension, and whether they
had a specialist encounter.
Record Review
The record review that was conducted
of 20 random patients with identified
clinical inertia revealed that inertia, or
lack of intensification, was patient-
driven in 11 and physician-driven in the
remaining 9. Every patient with inertia
demonstrated multiple noncompliance be-
haviors, including missed appointments
(clinical, laboratory, or nutrition consulta-
tions) and nonadherence to treatment
regimens (medications, diet, or exercise).
Instances of physician inertia were simply
related to the physician’s failure to inten-
sify therapy as indicated to address an
A1C elevation.
CONCLUSIONS
Research using the United States Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey database reported that from
2007 to 2010, only 52.5% of people
with diabetes achieved an A1C ,7.0%
(3). This may be partly because in clinical
practice, health care providers (and pa-
tients) fail to intensify therapy when it is
indicated. Recent literature has noted
that the median time to treatment in-
tensification among those in whom met-
formin monotherapy fails, the preferred
first-line agent, was greater than 1 year.
In addition, the study noted that inten-
sification occurred more quickly in those
with higher A1Cs than those with A1Cs
closer to goal (,7%) (4). This suggests
that clinicians (and patients) may not be
as aggressive with the intensification of
treatment when a patient is closer
to an A1C of 7%, a worrisome observa-
tion, because residual A1C elevation
above 7% still increases the risk of dia-
betes-related complications. An addi-
tional study using the General Electric
Centricity Electronic Medical Record da-
tabase evaluated the effect of time to
treatment intensification on glycemic
goal attainment in patients in whom
metformin monotherapy failed, and re-
ported an adjusted odds ratio (OR) for
glycemic goal attainment of 1.36 (95% CI
1.09–1.72) comparing early add-on to
late add-on treatment. This association
was stronger among patients with a
higher trigger A1C at baseline, with
ORs of 1.53 (95% CI 1.08–2.19) for

Intensification of Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes
Diabetes Care Volume 39, September 2016
 A1C $8% and 2.63 (95% CI 1.40–5.27)
for A1C $9% (14).
However, the results of these studies
may not be generalizable to the popula-
tion of patients with newly diagnosed
type 2 diabetes. This study is unique in
that it evaluated the concepts of clinical
inertia, the time until intervention
based on the A1C after at least 3 months
of metformin monotherapy, and the
time until A1C is under control with
early versus a late (or no) intervention,
in patients with newly diagnosed type 2
diabetes. Until this report, the literature
pertaining to these concepts has been
limited to the prevalent population of
patients with type 2 diabetes.
The results of this study highlight
many important aspects of clinical prac-
tice in the management of patients with
type 2 diabetes. First, many patients
with residual A1C elevation after at least
3 months of metformin monotherapy
do not undergo an intervention/intensi-
fication of therapy within 6 months of
the first A1C assessment (i.e., the ini-
tial/baseline A1C after at least 3 months
of metformin monotherapy). The cur-
rent study noted that in those with a re-
sidual A1C elevation of .7%, .7.5%,
or .8%, 38%, 31%, and 28%, respec-
tively, failed to undergo an intervention
to further improve glycemic control
within 6 months. These patients, by def-
inition, experienced clinical inertia, the
lack of intensification despite a reason
to do so (i.e., an A1C above goal). Al-
though many of these patients did
eventually undergo an intervention to
improve glycemia within 2 years of the
initial/baseline A1C, this is a longer pe-
riod than would be desired. A delay in
treatment intensification by 1 year, in
conjunction with poor glycemic control,
has been reported to significantly in-
crease the risk of macrovascular events
(15). Patients with type 2 diabetes are
often highly motivated near the time of
diagnosis, so it would seem important to
leverage this motivation and intervene
to improve glycemic control early on in
the disease process and not allow for
time to pass and perhaps risk losing the
patient to follow-up.
Secondly, this study highlights that
the time until intervention is signifi-
cantly affected by the initial/baseline
A1C. The time until intervention was
lower in those with higher initial/baseline
A1Cs; that is, higher A1Cs appear to have
encouraged the clinician and patient to
intervene sooner, as indicated, and in-
tensify the therapeutic approach. This
suggests that “borderline” or A1C levels
that are slightly above goal are less
likely to be addressed in a timely man-
ner versus those that clearly remain too
high (.8%).
Lastly, and most importantly, the
analysis found that the probability of a
patient having his or her A1C under con-
trol is higher in those who undergo an
early intervention (within 6 months)
than in those who undergo a later (or
no) intervention and that this persisted
moving forward in time (Fig. 2). Thus, fail-
ure to intervene early, when it is indi-
cated, may have a lasting effect on the
ability to attain glycemic control. This is a
worrisome finding, because glycemic con-
trol early in the course of disease has “a
legacy effect” on the development of fu-
ture diabetes-related complications (16).
In addition to the baseline A1C, pa-
tient age was the only additional vari-
able associated with clinical inertia.
Older patients were less likely to un-
dergo an early intervention. This may
be because older patients often have
more comorbidities and additional so-
cial issues (insurance coverage, fixed in-
come, etc.) that may serve as barriers to
intensification or they may have had
higher individualized A1C goals. The de-
velopment of clinical inertia was not
influenced by provider type (specialist
vs. primary care). The percentage of
patients with a specialist encounter
was similar between patients with an
A1C .7% who underwent an early in-
tervention (10%) versus a late (or no)
intervention (8%) (P = 0.25). Thus, the
results of our report appear generaliz-
able to the population of patients with
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes man-
aged by primary care, irrespective of
their access to specialty care.
At first glance, the median follow-up
A1C data appears similar whether an
early intervention occurred or not; how-
ever, when the median follow-up A1C
values are compared with their respec-
tive baseline A1C values, stratified by
intervention status and baseline A1C
category (Table 2), an improvement in
A1C in those who underwent an early
intervention versus a late (or no) inter-
vention was observed. Those who un-
derwent early intensification were
observed to have a higher median base-
line A1C. This supports the assertion
that the baseline A1C value is a factor
behind the development of clinical iner-
tia: the closer the A1C is to goal (,7% in
general), the more likely a patient is to
experience inertia.
The population appeared to be rela-
tively well controlled at baseline: only
22% of the subjects had an A1C .7%
and only 8% had an A1C .8%. The

 relatively good control observed at
baseline may possibly be a reflection of
the nature of the Cleveland Clinic Health
System (an integrated delivery system),
patient access to specialty care, or per-
haps simply because the study was fo-
cused on a population of patients with
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Of the
5,239 patients included in this report,
4703 (90%), were seen by primary care
and only 536 (10%) were seen by an en-
docrinologist. Thus, access to specialty
care does not appear to explain the rel-
atively good glycemic control observed
at baseline. In addition, in the popula-
tion of patients with an A1C .7% at
baseline, where an intensification of
management was indicated, there were
no statistically significant differences
between the percentages of patients
seen by a specialist versus a primary

Intensification of Therapy in Type 2 Diabetes

 care provider, stratified by early versus
late (or no) intervention. This suggests
that the likelihood of an early inter-
vention is independent of provider
type. Accordingly, the findings of this
report appear to be very generalizable
to the population of patients with type 2
diabetes without access to specialty
care.
Although the current clinical standard
of care is reassessing A1C in 3 months
and adjusting therapy accordingly, the
decision was made to use a 6-month
period to allow for an intervention be-
cause use of the shorter time may have
resulted in an overestimation of the
problem. If a patient did not undergo
an intervention within 6 months, it would
be very clear that the patient was inap-
propriately not undergoing treatment
intensification.
The record review of 20 random pa-
tients with clinical inertia revealed that
clinical inertia in 55% of the patients was
patient driven. Every patient with “pa-
tient inertia” demonstrated multiple
noncompliance behaviors. Most in-
stances of physician inertia were simply
related to the physician’s failure to in-
tensify therapy where indicated.
The strengths of this study include the
large number of patients with newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes that were
included in the analysis, a novel ap-
proach, and the large amount of clinical
information that was available for those
patients included in the analysis. Unlike
other studies that have evaluated the
various concepts of clinical inertia
(4,14,15), the current analysis included
numerous interventions in the definition
of intensification rather than simply de-
fining an intervention as the addition of
another antidiabetic agent, which may
not always be the modality by which a
treatment intensification occurs. More-
over, follow-up A1C information was
available on most of the subjects, which
allowed an analysis of the effects of an
intervention on glycemic control and,
more importantly, the timing of that in-
tervention on long-term glycemic goal
attainment.
This study is not without limitations.
A patient’s personal A1C goal may have
been different or individualized in accor-
dance with the most recent American
Diabetes Association/European Associa-
tion for the Study of Diabetes guidelines
(1), but such individual goals were not
obtainable from the structured EHR
data. However, it is unlikely that very
many patients have an individualized
A1C goal .8%; thus, the results at this
A1C cut point would appear to be very
generalizable to the population with
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. A
switch from metformin to extended-
release metformin, which is often better
tolerated than immediate-release met-
formin, was also not counted as an
intervention.
The current study was unable to ex-
plore the relationship between early in-
tensification and the development of
complications related to type 2 diabetes
and other long-term health outcomes,
because this would have required more
than the few years of follow-up informa-
tion that was available for these patients
at the time of the analysis. Certainly, this
would be an area of future study to pur-
sue once the follow-up and health out-
comes of these patients with newly
diagnosed type 2 diabetes accrue within
the EHR. Future studies assessing treat-
ment adherence and evaluating its effect
on A1C goal attainment and health out-
comes would also be of interest. These
issues could not be evaluated in the pre-
sent report given the short-duration of
follow-up and lack of pharmacy fill-data
of the prescribed medications for all the
patients included in the analysis (both
additional limitations). Lastly, although
the additional information obtained from
the EHR review was interesting, the rela-
tively small number of records reviewed
is a limitation.

 The results of this study would seem
to provide support for the most recent
American Association of Clinical Endo-
crinologists guidelines (2), which re-
commend aggressive intensification of
antidiabetic therapy after 3 months of
monotherapy failure as well as after
3 months of dual-therapy failure. Failure
to make these early interventions, as
these results suggest, have a significant
effect on the patients’ long-term attain-
ment of glycemic control. The UK Prospec-
tive Diabetes Study 10-year follow-up of
intensive glucose control in patients with
type 2 diabetes demonstrated the impor-
tance of early glycemic control on the de-
velopment of long-term diabetes-related
complications. The results of this study
demonstrate that to obtain glycemic con-
trol,cliniciansandpatientsneedtoescalate
the therapeutic interventions earlier in the
disease course and in a timelier manner.
