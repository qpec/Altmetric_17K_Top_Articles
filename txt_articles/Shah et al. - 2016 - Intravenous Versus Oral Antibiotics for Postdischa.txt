abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Postdischarge treatment of complicated pneumonia includes 
antibiotics administered intravenously via a peripherally inserted central venous catheter 
(PICC) or orally. Antibiotics administered via PICC, although effective, may result in serious 
complications. We compared the effectiveness and treatment-related complications of 
postdischarge antibiotics delivered by these 2 routes.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study included children ≥2 months and <18 
years discharged with complicated pneumonia between 2009 and 2012. The main exposure 
was the route of postdischarge antibiotic administration, classified as PICC or oral. The 
primary outcome was treatment failure. Secondary outcomes included PICC complications, 
adverse drug reactions, other related revisits, and a composite of all 4 outcomes, termed “all 
related revisits.”
RESULTS: Among 2123 children, 281 (13.2%) received antibiotics via PICC. Treatment failure 
rates were 3.2% among PICC and 2.6% among oral antibiotic recipients and were not 
significantly different between the groups in across-hospital-matched analysis (matched 
odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 2.94). PICC complications 
occurred in 7.1%. Adverse drug reactions occurred in 0.6% of children; PICC antibiotic 
recipients had greater odds of adverse drug reaction in across hospital matched analysis 
(matched OR, 19.1; 95% CI, 4.2 to 87.3). The high rate of PICC complications and differences 
in adverse drug reactions contributed to higher odds of the composite outcome of all related 
revisits among PICC antibiotic recipients (matched OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 2.97 to 7.46).
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment failure rates between PICC and oral antibiotics did not differ. 
Children with complicated pneumonia should preferentially receive oral antibiotics at 
discharge when effective oral options are available.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Postdischarge treatment 
of complicated pneumonia includes antibiotics administered 
intravenously via a peripherally inserted central venous 
catheter (PICC) or orally. Postdischarge antibiotics 
administered via PICC, although effective, may result in serious 
complications.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Treatment failure rates were low 
(2.7%) and not signifi
 cantly different between PICC and oral 
antibiotic therapy recipients. PICC complications occurred in 
7.1% of children resulting in signifi
 cantly higher adjusted revisit 
rates among those receiving PICC (17.8%) versus oral (3.1%) 
antibiotics.

Community-acquired pneumonia is 
the most common, serious childhood 
infection requiring hospitalization. 
1, 
 
2 
Up to 15% of children hospitalized 
with pneumonia develop pleural 
effusion or empyema (ie, complicated 
pneumonia). 
3, 
 
4 Treatment may 
include pleural drainage but 
almost always requires prolonged 
antibiotic therapy.1, 
 
5, 
 
6 Antibiotics are 
typically administered intravenously 
during the hospitalization but 
can be continued either orally or 
intravenously via a peripherally 
inserted central catheter (PICC) after 
hospital discharge.
Prolonged intravenous antibiotics 
administered via PICC, although 
effective, may result in serious 
complications (eg, catheter-associated 
bloodstream infections, venous 
thrombosis) and additional health care 
utilization (eg, evaluation for fever 
necessitating hospital admission). 
7 
– 
9 
Oral antibiotics have proven effective 
compared with antibiotics via PICC for 
other bacterial infections such as acute 
osteomyelitis. 
10 National guidelines 
do not directly address the preferred 
route of postdischarge antibiotic 
therapy in children with complicated 
pneumonia but instead highlight 
the risks of PICC complications and 
emphasize the safety and effectiveness 
of oral therapy in other serious 
infections.1 Only 1 single-center study 
has addressed the effectiveness of 
PICC compared with oral antibiotic 
therapy in children with complicated 
pneumonia. 
11
Our objectives were to compare 
the effectiveness of postdischarge 
oral versus intravenous antibiotics 
delivered via a PICC for children 
with complicated pneumonia and to 
determine differences in treatment-
related complications.
METHODS
Study Design and Data Source
This retrospective cohort study 
used data from the Pediatric Health 
Information System (PHIS), which 
contains hospital administrative and 
billing data from children’s hospitals 
affiliated with the Children’s Hospital 
Association (Overland Park, KS). 
12, 
 
13 
We supplemented the PHIS data with 
information from the medical record 
to (1) confirm eligibility, (2) determine 
postdischarge antibiotic choice and 
route, (3) review reasons for return 
emergency department (ED) visits 
and rehospitalizations within 14 days 
after index discharge, and (4) identify 
causative bacteria from blood and 
pleural fluid culture. These data were 
collected and managed using secure, 
Web-based Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap, Nashville, TN) tools 
and subsequently merged with PHIS 
data. 
14
Participants
We queried PHIS for children who 
(1) were ≥2 months and <18 years 
of age on the date of admission; (2) 
were discharged between January 1, 
2009, and December 31, 2012; and 
(3) had an International Classification 
of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD-9-CM) discharge 
diagnosis code for both pneumonia 
(480.×–483.×, 485.×–487.×) and 
pleural effusion (510.0, 510.9, 511.0, 
511.1, 511.9) where the primary ICD-
9-CM code was either pneumonia or 
pleural effusion ( 
Fig 1). 
15 If a child 
had multiple hospitalizations within 
a 14-day period, the first admission 
was considered the eligible 
encounter, whereas subsequent 
admissions were classified as 
readmissions.
We used PHIS data to exclude 
children from the study cohort 
if they (1) had a concurrent or 
previous ICD-9-CM code for a chronic 
condition that would increase the 
risk of treatment failure with either 
modality or preclude oral antibiotic 
use (ie, cardiovascular, respiratory, 
hematology, immunodeficiency, 
or malignancy) 
16; (2) were not 
admitted through the ED, thus 
excluding most children transferred 
from another hospital for whom 
pretransfer data would neither be 
available in PHIS nor consistently 
available in the medical records; (3) 
did not receive antibiotics on the 
first day of hospitalization, making 
it unlikely that they had bacterial 
pneumonia at presentation; (4) had 
a length of stay <4 days, which might 
increase the likelihood of discharge 
with intravenous antibiotics for 
prolonged therapy, or >14 days, 
which might increase the likelihood 
of discharge with oral antibiotics 
as planned antibiotic therapy was 
nearly complete; or (5) transferred 
to another facility or expired during 
their hospitalization ( 
Fig 1).
Investigators from 38 hospitals 
attended a webinar to receive training 
on eligibility criteria, relevant data 
elements, and use of the REDCap 
database. 
10 Sites received lists of 
patients and hospitalizations for 
medical record review based on 
eligibility criteria applied to PHIS data, 
including the index hospitalization 
(ie, eligible encounter) as well as all 
return visits (ED or hospitalization) 
up to 14 days after index discharge. 
Children were then excluded based 
on medical record review if they 
(1) had a medical record that was 
not reviewed, (2) had a record that 
could not be located, (3) did not 
have complicated pneumonia (to 
qualify for a diagnosis of complicated 
pneumonia on medical record review, 
a patient had to have pneumonia 
with pleural effusion or empyema 
documented on chest radiograph), 
(4) had exclusion criteria identified 
during medical record review (eg, 
transferred from another hospital, no 
antibiotics prescribed at discharge, 
comorbidities not identified by ICD-
9-CM codes), or (5) had data quality 
issues (eg, intravenous antibiotics at 
discharge but no documentation of 
PICC placement).
Main Exposure
The main exposure, determined 
by medical record review, was the 
route of postdischarge antibiotic

administration, classified as PICC or 
oral. If a PICC was placed during the 
index hospitalization but removed 
before discharge and the child 
was prescribed oral antibiotics at 
discharge, the child was classified as 
receiving oral therapy. Our data-use 
agreement did not permit disclosure 
of individual hospital performance 
in an identifiable manner. Therefore, 
hospital-level PICC use is presented in 
a deidentified manner but grouped by 
US Census Bureau Census Divisions to 
permit geographic comparisons. 
17
Outcome Measures
Outcomes were verified by medical 
record review. The main outcome 
was treatment failure, defined as an 
ED revisit or rehospitalization that 
resulted in extension or change of 
antibiotic therapy or performance of 
pleural drainage. Secondary outcomes 
included (1) PICC complications, 
defined as fever evaluation, PICC 
insertion site or bloodstream 
infection, sepsis, or PICC thrombosis; 
(2) adverse drug reactions, defined as 
diarrhea, Clostridium difficile infection, 
rash, erythema multiforme or Stevens-
Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis, 
drug-induced neutropenia, drug fever, 
acute kidney injury, serum sickness, 
or other drug-related complications; 
(3) ED revisits or rehospitalizations 
not classified as treatment failure, 
PICC complication, or adverse drug 
reaction but plausibly related to the 
index encounter or treatment (eg, 
chest pain, chest tube site drainage); 
and (4) a composite outcome 
measure of treatment failure, PICC 
complication, adverse drug reaction, 
and other plausibly related ED revisits 
or rehospitalizations.
Covariates
PHIS provided information on age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, insurance, and 
pleural drainage procedures (ICD-
9-CM procedure codes 34.04, 34.06, 
34.09, 34.21, 34.51, 34.52, 34.91). 
5 
Pleural drainage was classified as 
none, chest tube, or surgical (ie, 
video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery 
or thoracotomy). Pleural drainage 
timing was classified as early (ie, 
performed ≤2 days after admission) 
or late (ie, performed >2 days after 
admission) based on the index 
procedure performed. Medical record 
review provided results of blood 
and pleural fluid cultures as well as 
discharge antibiotics. Cephalosporins, 
antistaphylococcal penicillins, and 
β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (eg, 
ampicillin-sulbactam, amoxicillin-
clavulanate) were classified as anti–
methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus 
aureus (MSSA) agents. Clindamycin, 
newer generation fluoroquinolones 
(eg, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin), 
linezolid, and vancomycin were 
classified as anti–methicillin-resistant 
S. aureus (MRSA) agents.

Statistical Methods
Matching
Matching balanced patient level 
covariates in the PICC and oral 
antibiotic groups. Patient-level 
covariates were incorporated in 
a logistic regression for whether 
a patient received PICC or oral 
antibiotics to generate a propensity 
score for treatment. This model 
included the following patient-level 
covariates: age, race, insurance, 
length of stay in days, blood culture 
results (culture negative vs culture 
positive), ICU admission, and timing 
and route of pleural drainage. To 
ensure the best matches on patient 
level factors, matching was done 
across hospitals because the number 
of patients assigned to PICC and oral 
groups within each hospital was 
sparse.
To make use of all possible 
observations while minimizing 
differences across observations, 
we used full matching based on 
these propensity scores. 
18 
– 
20 Full 
matching links each PICC-treated 
child to the oral therapy-treated 
child with the closest propensity 
score, or vice versa, in a manner 
that results in varying numbers 
of matches in each resulting 
set. Then we weighted children 
receiving oral antibiotics in each 
matched set to standardize results 
to the characteristics of the PICC 
children. Finally, we compared the 
weighted characteristics of the 
PICC and the oral therapy children 
to determine the degree of balance 
between the 2 samples. Propensity 
score modeling and full matching 
were implemented using the 
program fullmatch in the R software 
package version 3.1 (https:// 
github. 
com/ 
markmfredrickson/ 
optmatch).
Response Models
Both stratified approaches and 
marginal models were used to generate 
the results for the response model. The 
stratified approaches condition on the 
matched set but dropped subjects if a 
matched set did not contain patients 
with differing outcomes. By contrast, 
marginal models used all patients 
without stratification, thus matching 
and the weighting resulted in 2 groups 
of patients who were similar except 
for route of antibiotic therapy on 
discharge.
Odds ratios were generated by 
the conditional logistic regression. 
As a secondary analysis, we used 
weighted logistic regression 
to estimate standardized risk 
differences for the effect of PICC on 
outcomes. 
21 All variance estimates 
and confidence bounds were 
confirmed using robust variances. 
22 
All response models and resampling 
was performed using the 
programs logit, clogit, and 
bootstrap, and with a custom 
program for this application, all 
using Stata v 13.1 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX).
RESULTS
We identified 7280 eligible 
encounters from 38 hospitals. We 
excluded 4550 encounters that 
met exclusion criteria derived 
from PHIS and an additional 607 
encounters that met exclusion 
criteria derived from medical 
record review, including 103 
encounters from the 2 hospitals 
that did not review any records and 
33 encounters from 2 hospitals that 
were unable to review records for 
some patients in the required study 
timeframe ( 
Fig 1). The remaining 
2123 children from 36 hospitals 
were included. Of these, 1241 
(58.5%) were white, 338 (15.9%) 
black, 135 (6.5%) Asian or Native 
American, and 409 (19.3%) other 
race ( 
Table 1); 498 (23.5%) were 
classified as Hispanic ethnicity. 
The median age was 5.0 years 
(interquartile range, 2.0–8.0).
Pleural drainage was performed in 
931 (43.9%) children. A pathogen 
was identified in blood or pleural 
fluid culture in 305 (14.4%) children. 
The most common pathogens were 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 175), 
Staphylococcus aureus (n = 77), 
Streptococcus pyogenes 
(n = 21), and Streptococcus milleri 
group bacteria (n = 9). MRSA 
comprised 56 (72.7%) of the S aureus 
isolates. The median hospital length 
of stay was 7 days (interquartile 
range, 5–10). The hospital-level 
median length of stay ranged from 5 
to 9.5 days, with a median of hospital 
medians of 7.0 days.
Overall, 281 (13.2%) children 
received antibiotics via PICC 
postdischarge. PICC use

postdischarge varied across 
hospitals, ranging from 0% to 
71%. PICC use also varied within 
and among census regions ( 
Fig 
2). The most common antibiotics 
administered via PICC were anti-
MSSA antibiotics alone (n = 117, 
41.6%); an anti-MSSA antibiotic 
plus an anti-MRSA antibiotic 
(n = 73, 26.0%); and anti-MRSA 
antibiotics alone (n = 42, 14.9%). 
The most common antibiotics 
administered orally were anti-
MSSA agents alone (n = 462, 
25.1%); anti-MRSA agents alone 
(n = 422, 22.9%); anti-MRSA 
agent in combination with an anti-
MSSA agent (n = 261, 14.2%); and 
amoxicillin alone (n = 214, 11.6%). 
Postdischarge antibiotics were 
prescribed for a median of 14 days 
(interquartile range, 7–14 days); 
5% of subjects were prescribed 
21 or more days of antibiotics 
postdischarge. No patient in whom 
a pathogen was identified received 
discordant therapy at discharge.
Before matching, children with 
postdischarge PICC antibiotic 
therapy had higher rates of 
surgical drainage, ICU admission, 
and positive cultures ( 
Table 1). 
Treatment failure before matching 
occurred in 57 (2.7%) children 
overall, 3.2% in those with PICC 
antibiotic therapy and 2.6% in 
those with oral antibiotic therapy 
( 
Table 2). No treatment failures 
occurred among the 77 patients 
with S aureus isolated. Among 
children discharged with oral 
antibiotic therapy for culture-
negative infection, treatment failure 
occurred in 1.4% and 1.9% of those 
discharged with amoxicillin and 
anti-MRSA antibiotics, respectively. 
Management of treatment failure 
included pleural drainage (n = 
28, 49.1% of treatment failures), 
change in antibiotics for new or 
persistent symptoms (n = 18, 
31.6%), extension of antibiotic 
course for persistent symptoms 
(n = 3, 5.3%), or other reasons 
(n = 8, 14.0%). Three children 
(0.1%), 2 receiving oral antibiotics 
and 1 receiving PICC antibiotics, 
developed a bronchopleural 
fistula.
PICC complications, which occurred 
in 20 (7.1%) children, included PICC 
thrombosis resulting in malfunction 
(n = 11), PICC dislodgement or 
breakage (n = 4), insertion site 
cellulitis (n = 1), and fever evaluation 
(n = 1); details of the complications 
were not available for 3 patients. 
No PICC-associated bloodstream 
infections were reported. Adverse 
drug reactions occurred in 13 (0.6%) 
children overall; 6 had a rash, 2 
had gastrointestinal symptoms 
(abdominal pain), and 1 each 
developed serum sickness, drug-
induced neutropenia, drug fever, 
heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, 
and joint pain. Other related visits 
occurred in 73 (3.4%) of children. 
The most common reasons included 
respiratory complaints (eg, 
tachypnea, cough; n = 29), vomiting/
dehydration (n = 18), chest pain (n = 
10), chest tube site drainage (n = 4), 
abdominal pain (n = 2), and seizure 
(n = 2).
Matching resolved differences in 
patient characteristics, including 
rates and timing of pleural drainage 
( 
Table 1). After matching, there 
were no significant differences in 
treatment failure rates between 
PICC and oral antibiotic recipients 
(matched odds ratio [OR], 1.26; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 
2.94) ( 
Table 2). In matched analysis, 
adverse drug reactions, other related 
revisits (ie, revisits not related to 
treatment failure, adverse drug 
reactions, or PICC complications), 
and all revisits related to complicated 
pneumonia remained significantly 
higher in those receiving antibiotics 
via PICC compared with the oral 
route ( 
Table 2).

pneumonia treated at 36 children’s 
hospitals. Although PICC use was 
not common overall, there was 
substantial variation in postdischarge 
PICC use across participating 
hospitals. Treatment failure rates 
were not significantly different 
between those treated with PICC 
versus oral antibiotics at discharge. 
However, children discharged with 
PICCs experienced a high rate of 
PICC complications and adverse 
drug reactions, resulting in high 
rates of ED revisits and hospital 
readmissions.
We found substantial variation 
in PICC use in children with 
complicated pneumonia. Although 
patient and disease characteristics 
contribute to such variation, 
clustering of treatment strategies by 
hospital suggests that institutional 
factors are major determinants of 
care practices. Highlighting these 
differences in PICC use is a first 
step toward reducing unwarranted 
variation.
National guidelines recommend 
2 to 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy 
for complicated pneumonia. 
1 The 
optimal route of antibiotic therapy 
has been a source of considerable 
debate. National guidelines highlight 
the effectiveness of oral antibiotics 
for other serious bacterial infections 
but emphasize the absence of 
comparative data in children 
with complicated pneumonia. 
1 
Although effective treatment 
of children with complicated 
pneumonia requires adequate 
antibiotic concentrations in the 
lung and pleural space, parenteral 
therapy may not be necessary. 
Antibiotics such as amoxicillin, 
clindamycin, and linezolid have 
excellent bioavailability after oral 
ingestion and provide appropriate 
coverage for salient pathogens. 
Only 1 previous study compared 
oral with intravenous antibiotics 
for complicated pneumonia. 
11 
Stockmann et al examined outcomes 
of 391 children hospitalized with 
complicated pneumonia at a single 
center; 337 (86%) children received 
antibiotics via PICC. 
11 Postdischarge 
pneumonia-related complications, 
using a comparable treatment 
failure definition, occurred in 5 
(2%) patients discharged with 
antibiotics via PICC and 2 (4%; P = 
.25) patients discharged with oral 
antibiotics. In our multicenter study, 
differences in treatment failure rates 
between the PICC and oral antibiotic 
groups were not significant. For the 
matched analysis, children on oral 
antibiotics had a 1.8 percentage 
point lower risk of treatment failure. 
Although this result is not significant 
at conventional levels, the lower 
bound of the 95% CI (–0.4% points) 
suggests that we can rule out oral 
antibiotics as having a greater 
risk of treatment failure of clinical 
importance.
We divided therapy complications 
into PICC-associated complications 
and adverse reactions from 
antibiotics. The high rate of PICC 
complications (7.1%) contributed 
to the significantly high rate of all 
revisits among children receiving 
antibiotics via PICC. In contrast, 
Stockmann et al found that while 
PICC complications occurred in 
5% of patients with complicated 
pneumonia, differences in overall 
treatment-related complications 
between patients receiving oral 
(5.6%) or PICC (7.7%, P = .78) 
antibiotics were not significant. 
11 In 
our study, adverse drug reactions, 
while low overall, occurred more 
commonly among those receiving 
antibiotics via PICC. Although

adverse drug reactions are often 
considered unavoidable, our data 
highlight that the route of therapy, 
primarily by virtue of antibiotic 
selection, can contribute to their 
preventability.
This study had several limitations. 
First, as with any observational 
study, we could not account for 
some variables associated with 
illness severity, such as size and 
character of the pleural effusion or 
presence of necrotizing pneumonia. 
These variables may be associated 
with both treatment decisions (eg, 
need for pleural drainage) and 
outcomes. We believe that our 
large multicenter sample and the 
analytic approaches to address 
confounding minimize the impact 
of this limitation. A randomized 
clinical trial may better balance 
unmeasured confounders than our 
observational study. However, we 
believe that such a trial is unlikely 
given ethical considerations and 
institutional bias to participation 
as suggested by clustering of 
postdischarge PICC use by center. 
Second, we matched across 
hospitals because the paucity 
of patients with PICCs at some 
hospitals precluded within hospital 
matching. This limitation made 
it more challenging to account 
for hospital-level differences; 
however, matching across hospitals 
more effectively accounts for 
confounding by indication than 
matching within hospitals. The 
influence of hospital-level factors 
on outcomes is mitigated by the low 
rate of treatment failures overall. 
Third, the frequency and severity 
of adverse drug events depend, in 
part, on the antibiotic received. 
Thus, the differences in the types 
of antibiotics received rather than 
the route of antibiotic therapy per 
se may explain the higher rates of 
adverse drug reactions in those 
receiving antibiotics via PICC. 
Nevertheless, the higher rate of 
adverse drug reactions in the PICC 
group should be considered when 
determining route of antibiotic 
therapy postdischarge. Finally, we 
were not able to assess revisits to 
primary care. Children receiving 
oral antibiotics may be more likely 
than those receiving intravenous 
antibiotics to seek care in the 
primary setting when adverse 
events occur. If some of these 
adverse events did not result in 
an ED revisit or rehospitalization, 
we may have underestimated 
the occurrence of adverse drug 
events or other complications in 
the oral therapy group. However, 
such events may be less serious, 
an important consideration when 
weighing risks and benefits of oral 
versus PICC antibiotic treatment 
options.
CONCLUSIONS
Differences in treatment failure 
rates between PICC and oral 
antibiotic recipients were not 
significant. However, adverse 
drug reactions and PICC-
associated complications 
contributed to the higher rates 
of reutilization among PICC 
antibiotic recipients. Although 
antibiotics via PICC may be 
appropriate for select patients, 
our study highlights the importance 
of preferentially treating children 
with complicated pneumonia 
with oral antibiotics at discharge 
when effective oral options are 
available.
