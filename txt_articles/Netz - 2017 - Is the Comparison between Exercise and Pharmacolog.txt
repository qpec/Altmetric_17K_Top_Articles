Major depression disorder is most commonly treated with antidepressants. However,
due to their side effects clinicians seek non-pharmacologic options, and one of these
is exercise. The literature on the benefits of exercise for depression is extensive.
Nevertheless, two recent reviews focusing on antidepressants vs. other therapies as
a basis for clinical practice guidelines recommended mainly antidepressants, excluding
exercise as a viable choice for treatment of depression. The aim of this perspective
is to analyze the literature exploring the reasons for this discrepancy. Two categories
of publications were examined: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses
or systematic reviews. Based on this reassessment, RCTs comparing exercise to
antidepressants reported that exercise and antidepressants were equally effective.
RCTs comparing exercise combined with antidepressants to antidepressants only
reported a significant improvement in depression following exercise as an adjunctive
treatment. Almost all the reviews examining exercise vs. other treatments of depression,
including antidepressants, support the use of exercise in the treatment of depression,
at least as an adjunctive therapy. The two reviews examining pharmacologic vs. non-
pharmacologic therapies as a basis for clinical practice guidelines examined limited
evidence on exercise vs. antidepressants. In addition, it is possible that academics and
health care practitioners are skeptical of viewing exercise as medicine. Maybe, there is a
reluctance to accept that changes in lifestyle as opposed to pharmacological treatment
can alter biological mechanisms. Longitudinal studies are needed for assessing the
effectiveness of exercise in real clinical settings, as well as studies exploring dose-
response relationship between exercise and depression.

INTRODUCTION
The perception of exercise as medicine has been discussed in relation to health conditions such as
cognitive decline (e.g., Nagamatsu et al., 2014), cancer (e.g., Lin et al., 2016), cardiac rehabilitation
(e.g., Almodhy et al., 2016), schizophrenia (e.g., Firth et al., 2015), alcohol use disorders (e.g.,
Hallgren et al., 2017), and all-cause mortality (e.g., Eklund et al., 2016). One meta-epidemiological

study on mortality outcomes concluded that in a number of
health conditions, such as heart failure, stroke, and diabetes,
exercise and various pharmacological treatments are similar in
their potential to extend longevity (Naci and Ioannidis, 2013).
Thus, exercise interventions should be considered as a viable
alternative to, or combination with, drug therapy (Naci and
Ioannidis, 2013). It is therefore not surprising that comparative
assessments of exercise and drug treatments were performed
for some conditions, such as sleep disorders (Buman and King,
2010), chronic pain (Ambrose and Golightly, 2015), and mental
health (Firth et al., 2016).
Probably more than for other health conditions, comparative
benefits of exercise and pharmacologic treatments have been
examined and discussed in relation to depression (e.g., Stubbs
et al., 2015; Gartlehner et al., 2016). According to the
WHO (World Health Organization), depression is the leading
cause of disability worldwide (WHO, 2016 http://www.who.int/
mediacentre/factsheets/fs369/en/).
Major depression disorder (MDD) is most commonly treated
with
antidepressant
medication,
where
second-generation
antidepressants are the most commonly prescribed drugs
(Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2016).
However, many patients do not respond to antidepressant
medications, or experience side effects (Gartlehner et al., 2016).
In addition, increasing evidence indicated a large placebo
response, making it more challenging for novel medications
to demonstrate their effectiveness (Rutherford et al., 2012).
Therefore, clinicians and patients seek non-pharmacologic
options for treating depression – and one of them is physical
exercise (e.g., Martiny et al., 2012).
The literature on the benefits of exercise for both minor
and major depressive symptoms is extensive, with exceptionally
numerous reviews perhaps outnumbering randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) (e.g., Mead et al., 2009; Rethorst et al., 2009;
Krogh et al., 2011; Rimer et al., 2012; Robertson et al., 2012;
Cooney et al., 2013; Danielsson et al., 2013; Silveira et al., 2013;
Josefsson et al., 2014; Mura et al., 2014; Knapen et al., 2015;
Nyström et al., 2015; Stubbs et al., 2015; Kvam et al., 2016;
Schuch et al., 2016b). In addition to exercise, additional studies
(Adamson et al., 2016) and reviews (Zhai et al., 2015; Hallgren
et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016; Schuch et al., 2017) in recent years
examined the relationship between sedentary behavior, physical
activity, and depression. Interestingly, a recent study has shown
that a 1-week of forced sedentary behavior may cause bad mood
or depression in active individuals (Edwards and Loprinzi, 2016).
Furthermore, it has been found that people with depression
are at increased risk of sedentary behavior (Dugan et al., 2015;
Schuch et al., 2017), which may cause cardiovascular diseases and
metabolic syndromes (Gardner-Sood et al., 2015).
Along with RCTs and reviews examining exercise as a
treatment for depression, there have been attempts to explore
the mediating biological mechanisms explaining the reduction
in depression in MDD as a result of exercise (Kandola et al.,
2016; Schuch et al., 2016a). One explanation is hippocampus
plasticity (Kandola et al., 2016). It has been shown that the
hippocampus in depressed individuals may be affected by neuron
atrophy (Mendez-David et al., 2013). Aerobic exercise has the
potential to promote neuroplasticity and thus facilitate the
function of the hippocampus (Erickson et al., 2011). Through
increasing neuroplasticity in the hippocampus, it may be possible
to generate structural changes that affect the region’
s functioning
and contribute to the alleviation of cognitive malfunction in
MDD (Kandola et al., 2016). It has also been hypothesized that
there is a relationship between the decline in neurogenesis and
depressed mood (Duman et al., 1997). Based on the above, it was
concluded that the anti-depressive effects of exercise are due to
physiological changes that result in hippocampal neurogenesis
(Ernst et al., 2006).
One mechanisms by which exercise could potentially facilitate
this neurogenesis is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF). A growing number of studies, performed both on
animal models of depression and on depressed humans, have
focused on the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression (Neto
et al., 2011). According to this hypothesis, several alterations
in the levels of neurotrophins, particularly of the BDNF, might
produce the structural and neurochemical changes that underlie
depression (Neto et al., 2011). Both pharmacological and non-
pharmacological interventions for depression have been shown to
produce changes in the levels of neurotrophins. BDNF increases
have been reported to follow the administration of antidepressant
drugs (Czubak et al., 2009), which suggests that BDNF expression
may mediate the action of antidepressants. Furthermore, when
exercise is combined with antidepressants, BDNF levels were
found to increase in as little as two days, compared with two
weeks with antidepressants alone (Russo-Neustadt et al., 2001).
Another mechanism for enhancing neurogenesis is serotonin.
Adaptations in the serotonergic system may serve as potential
facilitators of the antidepressant effects of exercise (Schuch et al.,
2016a). As a result, antidepressant medications available today
target the release and reuptake of serotonin. Exercise increases
tryptophan hydroxylase (Chaouloff et al., 1989), which is
necessary for serotonin synthesis. Results of animal studies point
to a relationship between serotonin elevation and neurogenesis
(Brezun and Daszuta, 2000).
According to Schuch et al. (2016a), it is possible that the
antidepressant effect of exercise is caused by the interaction
of several neurobiological mechanisms rather than by one
mechanism exclusively. It is certain that exercise generates
both acute and chronic responses, mainly in hormones,
neurotrophines, and inflammation biomarkers (Schuch et al.,
2016a).
It is, therefore, not surprising that quite a few attempts have
been made to compare the effects of exercise to other treatments,
including drug treatments, in various depressive disorders,
specifically MDD. Four reviews on this topic were published in
2016. Two meta-analyses examining the efficacy of exercise as
a treatment for major depression concluded that exercise as a
treatment for depression can be recommended as a stand-alone
treatment or as an adjunct to antidepressant medication (Kvam
et al., 2016), and that exercise can be considered an evidence-
based treatment for the management of depression (Schuch et al.,
2016b). On the other hand, two systematic reviews comparing
antidepressants to other therapies – including exercise – as a
basis for clinical practice guidelines for depression, disregarded

exercise in their recommendations. One concluded that “
The
American College of Physicians recommends that clinicians
select between either cognitive behavioral therapy or second-
generation antidepressants to treat patients with major depressive
disorder. . .” (Qaseem et al., 2016, p. 355), and the other
that “
given comparable efficacy, cognitive behavioral therapy
and antidepressants are both viable choices for initial MDD
treatment”(Gartlehner et al., 2016, p. 338). The aim of this
perspective is to analyze the available literature on the efficacy of
exercise vs. antidepressants in the treatment of depression and to
suggest a few explanations for this discrepancy.
Publications Examined
Two categories of publications were examined: RCTs (Table 1)
and meta-analyses or systematic reviews (Table 2).
All RCTs published in 1999–
2016 that are included in
systematic and/or meta-analyses reviews published from 2009 to
2016 were examined, as well as two recent RCTs found in PubMed
search. RCTs were excluded if they assessed participants with
additional co-morbid diagnoses, such as cardiovascular diseases
(e.g., Blumenthal et al., 2012), or if they assessed two kinds of
interventions as add-on therapy – for example chronotherapy
vs. exercise (Martiny et al., 2012). One group of RCTs compared
exercise to antidepressants – monotherapy comparisons, and
the other compared exercise combined with antidepressants to
antidepressants only –combination comparisons (Table 1).
As a collection of RCTs does not reflect a general effect
size, meta-analyses, Cochrane reviews and systematic reviews
providing an effect size of exercise vs. antidepressants in the
treatment of depression were examined. As a large number of
meta-analyses and other reviews were conducted in the last
decade, it was decided to screen only reviews from the last
seven years (2009–
2016). Interestingly, in spite of the large
number of reviews, none of them focused solely on exercise
vs. antidepressants. One group compared exercise to other
treatments of depression, including antidepressants, and the
other compared antidepressants to other therapies, including
exercise. More specifically, the present review investigated:
(1) whether comparisons were conducted specifically between
exercise and antidepressants (as opposed to exercise vs. all other
treatments together, or antidepressants vs. all other treatments
together), (2) which RCTs comparing exercise to antidepressants
were included in these reviews, (3) which conclusions were drawn
from these comparisons, and (4) whether all published RCTs
conducting such comparisons were included in the reviews.
Summary and Conclusions of the
Findings
Randomized Controlled Trials
Exercise vs. antidepressants – monotherapy comparisons
(Table 1)
Three RCTs compared 4 months of exercise to antidepressants–
two for MDD (Blumenthal et al., 1999, 2007) and one for
minor depression (Brenes et al., 2007). Two were conducted
on older adults (Blumenthal et al., 1999; Brenes et al., 2007).
One study (Hoffman et al., 2011) was a follow-up to a previous
study (Blumenthal et al., 2007). The Blumenthal et al. (1999,
2007) studies included aerobic exercise, and the Brenes study a
combination of aerobic and resistance exercises.
Conclusion: All these studies reported that exercise and
standard antidepressant treatments were equally effective.
Exercise combined with antidepressants vs. antidepressants
only – combination comparisons (Table 1)
Eleven RCTs compared exercise as an adjunctive treatment
to antidepressants (combination comparisons) – 10 for MDD
and one for minor depression (Table 1). The duration of
the exercise period varied from 10 days (Knubben et al.,
2007; Legrand and Neff, 2016), to 6 weeks (Kerling et al.,
2015), 10 weeks (Mather et al., 2002), 3 months (Mota-Pereira
et al., 2011), 4 months (Carneiro et al., 2015), 6 months
(Murri et al. (2015), 8 months (Pilu et al., 2007), 12 months
(Chalder et al., 2012), to throughout a hospitalization period
(undefined time period) (Schuch et al., 2011, 2015). Control
groups included antidepressants only (Mather et al., 2002;
Pilu et al., 2007; Mota-Pereira et al., 2011; Schuch et al.,
2011, 2015; Chalder et al., 2012; Carneiro et al., 2015; Kerling
et al., 2015), light exercise with both exercise groups receiving
antidepressants (Knubben et al., 2007; Legrand and Neff, 2016),
and antidepressants only (Murri et al., 2015). The exercise mode
included mostly aerobics (Knubben et al., 2007; Mota-Pereira
et al., 2011; Schuch et al., 2011, 2015; Kerling et al., 2015; Murri
et al., 2015; Legrand and Neff, 2016) or aerobic and strength
(Pilu et al., 2007); aerobic, strength, and stretching exercises
(Mather et al., 2002); aerobics and strength exercises, games
and dancing (Carneiro et al., 2015), and facilitated physical
activity chosen and performed individually by participants
(Chalder et al., 2012). The studies using exercise in a control
group used light stretching (Knubben et al., 2007; Legrand
and Neff, 2016) and low-intensity aerobics (Murri et al., 2015).
Most studies assessed adults in general; only two studies
investigated older adults (Mather et al., 2002; Murri et al.,
2015).
Of special interest are the studies using exercise placebo
groups as a control group, in which improvements were observed
in the aerobic exercise as compared to stretching (Knubben et al.,
2007; Legrand and Neff, 2016), and the Murri et al. (2015) study
that showed the greatest improvement in high-intensity aerobics,
followed by low intensity aerobics, followed by antidepressants
only. The Chalder et al. (2012) study only gave guidance about
exercise but did not provide an exercise program.
Conclusion: All studies but one (Chalder et al., 2012) informed
that patients using exercise as an adjunctive treatment for
depression showed a significant depressive improvement after
the exercise period, and/or that the proportion of patients with
a clinical response was larger for the exercise group than the
control.

of exercise in the treatment of depression, at least as an
add-on therapy. Earlier reviews, which included only a few
RCTs, were more careful in actually recommending exercise.
For example, one review stated that “
it is reasonable to
recommend exercise. . .” (Mead et al., 2009, p. 14). Another
review pointed out that “
. . . exercise may be as effective
as psychological or pharmacological treatments. . .” (Cooney
et al., 2013, p. 35). Later reviews were more conclusive,
claiming “
a strong effectiveness of exercise combined with
antidepressants”(Mura et al., 2014, p. 503); “
Overall, our results
provide robust evidence that exercise can be considered an
evidence-based treatment for the management of depression.”
(Schuch et al., 2016b, p. 47); and “
Physical exercise is an effective
intervention for depression. It also could be a viable adjunct
treatment in combination with antidepressants”(Kvam et al.,
2016, p. 67).
On the other hand, the two recent reviews from 2016
assessing antidepressants vs. other treatments of depression,
including exercise, did not recommend exercise for the
treatment of depression (Gartlehner et al., 2016; Qaseem et al.,
2016). However, when comparing exercise to antidepressants,
these reviews examined mainly the Blumenthal et al. (1999,
2007) studies, excluding other RCTs comparing exercise to
antidepressants that were included in other recent reviews.
DISCUSSION
Exercise vs. pharmacologic treatment of depression in the clinical
practice guideline of the American College of Physicians –is it
evidence-based?
It appears that the reviews examining pharmacologic vs.
non-pharmacologic treatments of depression as a basis for
clinical practice guidelines examined limited evidence on exercise
vs. antidepressants, and thus disregarded exercise as a viable
choice for treating depression as a stand-alone treatment
or as an add-on therapy. This position is contrary to the
reviews examining exercise vs. other treatments for depression,
including antidepressants, which generally recommend exercise
as a stand-alone and/or as adjunctive treatment for depression.
The evidence is even greater when considering two additional
recent well-designed RCTs not included in any of the reviews
(possibly because they were published later than the RCTs
mentioned in the reviews) which pointed out the effect
of exercise as a complement to antidepressant medication
(Carneiro et al., 2015; Legrand and Neff, 2016) (Table 1).
Furthermore, while the underlying biological mechanisms
mediating between exercise and reduced depressive symptoms
are not entirely clear, it is apparent that exercise induces
both acute and chronic responses, particularly in hormones,
neurotrophines, and inflammation biomarkers, and that there is
an association between hippocampus neurogenesis as a result of
exercise and depressive symptoms’
improvement (Schuch et al.,
2016a).
Is exercise medicine for the treatment of depression?
Based on the present review, which examined most or
all RCTs published in 1999–
2016, and most or all meta-
analyses/systematic reviews published in 2009–
2016, it can
be
stated
that
exercise
is
an
evidenced-based
medicine
for depression – at least as an add-on to antidepressants.
Furthermore, people with depression are at increased risk
of sedentary behavior (Dugan et al., 2015; Schuch et al.,

effective as antidepressants, but small
number of trials and participants

Meta-analysis and
systematic review of
exercise vs. other
treatments (some
non-RCTs included)
Blumenthal et al., 2007;
Knubben et al., 2007
Exercise is an efficient alternative
treatment for depression (general effect
size), specifically in old age and for mild
depression. Based on Blumenthal et al.
(1999, 2007) studies, aerobic training is
as effective as antidepressants
Knapen et al., 2015
(review of reviews of
exercise vs. other
treatments
Cooney et al., 2013;
Silveira et al., 2013
General effect size: For mild to
moderate depression – exercise
comparable to antidepressants, for
severe depression – exercise valuable as
complementary therapy

A strong effectiveness of exercise
combined with antidepressants, but
the majority of studies suffered from
methodological weaknesses.
Schuch et al., 2016b
Meta-analysis of
exercise vs. other
treatments
Blumenthal et al., 2007;
Brenes et al., 2007; Pilu
et al., 2007; Mota-Pereira
et al., 2011; Kerling et al.,
2015; Schuch et al., 2015
A large and significant effect size of
exercise, larger for MDD, for aerobic
exercise, and for supervised formats.
Criticized previous meta-analyses for
underestimating benefits of exercise due
to publication bias. Not right to calculate
exercise-drugs as exercise may
potentially overlap with potential
mechanisms of drugs.

and combination therapy. However,
exercise not recommended as a
treatment of depression. Low quality
evidence
Gartlehner et al., 2016
Systematic review of all
treatments
Blumenthal et al.,
2007
Blumenthal et al.,
1999; Murri et al.,
2015
Exercise vs. antidepressants: no
difference in monotherapy,
improvement in combination therapy.
However, exercise not recommended
as a treatment of depression. Low to
moderate quality evidence
2017), which may cause cardiovascular diseases and metabolic
syndrome (Gardner-Sood et al., 2015). Thus, exercise contributes
to the physical health in addition to mental health. It is also worth
mentioning the adverse effects commonly associated with drugs,
including constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, headache, insomnia,
nausea, adverse sexual events, and somnolence (Qaseem et al.,
2016), which may further support the use of exercise as a viable
alternative or adjunctive pharmacotherapy.
It is unclear why exercise was disregarded as a viable
choice for treating depression in the clinical practice guidelines
recommended in the two recent reviews (Gartlehner et al., 2016;
Qaseem et al., 2016). Is there a reluctance among academics and
health care practitioners to view exercise as medicine? Do they
caution that there is no strong evidence to suggest that modifiable
lifestyle factors as opposed to pharmacological treatment can alter
biological mechanisms in similar pathways or similar dynamics
to biochemical interventions?
Interestingly, this argument was raised by Nagamatsu et al.
(2014) regarding the effect of exercise on the brain and cognition
in old age. These authors made the case that despite the large and
consistent pool of evidence generated over the past five decades
linking exercise to improved cognitive functions in older adults,
skepticism remains and health practitioners continue to hinder
the adoption of exercise as a legitimate medical strategy for the
prevention of cognitive decline.
Future directions of research should include dose-response
interventions to determine the precise dose of exercise required
to maximize the benefits for depression. In addition, more
studies
are
needed
to
inquire
the
underlying
molecular
and cellular mechanisms mediating between exercise and
depression. Furthermore, another important issue for assessing
the benefits of exercise for depression is its effectiveness as
opposed to efficacy (Beedie et al., 2016). While efficacy refers
to the ability of exercise to achieve the desired effect under
well
controlled
circumstances,
effectiveness
refers
to
the
ability of exercise to affect depression in real life situations.
Therefore,
longitudinal
observational
studies
exploring
the benefits of exercise in depression are needed, which
assess adherence issues as well as economic and professional
matters.
