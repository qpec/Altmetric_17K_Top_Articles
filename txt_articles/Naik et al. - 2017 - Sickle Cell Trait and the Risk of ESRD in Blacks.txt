ABSTRACT
Blacks, compared with whites, have an increased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease
(ESRD). Emerging evidence suggests that, in addition to APOL1 high-risk genotypes, hemoglobin
variants, including sickle cell trait (SCT) and hemoglobin C trait, have a role in kidney disease in
blacks. However, the association between these hemoglobin traits and ESRD remains unknown. In a
large population-based cohort, the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) study, we evaluated 9909 self-reported blacks (739 with SCT and 243 with hemoglobin
C trait). Incident ESRD occurred in 40 of 739 (5.4%) individuals with SCT, six of 243 (2.5%) individuals
with hemoglobin C trait, and 234 of 8927 (2.6%) noncarriers. The incidence rate for ESRD was 8.5 per
1000 person-years for participants with SCT and 4.0 per 1000 person-years for noncarriers. Com-
pared with individuals without SCT, individuals with SCT had a hazard ratio for ESRD of 2.03 (95%
confidence interval, 1.44 to 2.84). Hemoglobin C trait did not associate with prevalent CKD or ESRD.
The incidence rate for ESRD among participants with APOL1 high-risk genotypes was 6.6 per 1000
person-years, with a hazard ratio for ESRD of 1.77 (95% confidence interval, 1.31 to 2.38) for par-
ticipants with, compared with those without, APOL1 high-risk genotypes. In this cohort, SCT
strongly associated with risk of progression to ESRD in blacks, and this degree of risk for ESRD
was similar to that conferred by APOL1 high-risk genotypes. These results may have important
public policy implications for genetic counseling of SCT carriers.

 Blacks have a three- to five-fold increased risk of end-stage
renal disease (ESRD) compared with whites.1 This dispropor-
tionate burden of ESRD appears to relate to a higher rate of
progression of CKD to advanced-stage kidney disease, rather
than an increased risk of CKD alone.2,3 Socioeconomic, life-
style, and clinical factors only partially explain this observed
racial disparity in CKD,4 suggesting that genetic variation
likely plays a considerable role in the progression of kidney
disease in blacks.
APOL1 high-risk genotypes, which are present in about
11%–13% of blacks and are thought to confer resistance to
certain trypanosomal infections in African-ancestry popula-
tions, are the most widely recognized genetic contributors to
the risk of ESRD progression in blacks.5 However, it has re-
cently been recognized that another African ancestral genetic
variant, sickle cell trait (SCT), may also be an important risk
factor for CKD in this population.6 Similar to APOL1 high-
risk genotypes, SCT is common, occurring in 8%–9% of
blacks, and is thought to have evolutionarily persisted due to
its strong protective effect against malaria in endemic re-
gions.7 Despite emerging evidence of the association between
SCT and CKD in blacks, the risk of progression to ESRD in
SCT carriers has yet to be established.6,8,9 In addition, preva-
lence studies have suggested a possible association between
kidney disease and hemoglobin C trait, another common he-
moglobin variant,8 but prospective studies have not been per-
formed.
Using a large, geographicallydiverse cohort of blacks in the
REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) study, we sought to determine whether SCT
and hemoglobin C trait contribute to prevalent CKD and
incident ESRD risk. In addition, we aimed to characterize
the gene-gene interaction between APOL1 renal risk variants
and hemoglobin S/C trait to the risk of kidney disease.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
After exclusion of participants with missing data on genotypes
for hemoglobin S, C, or APOL1 renal risk variants (n=306),
missing relevant covariate (n=166) or outcome data (n=413),
and those with hemoglobin SS or SC disease (n=6), 9909 black
individuals were included in the primary analysis. The base-
line characteristics of these participants are described in Table
1. The prevalence of SCT and hemoglobin C trait was 7.5%
(n=739) and 2.5% (n=243), respectively. There were no sig-
nificant differences in age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, smok-
ing, and socioeconomic status between SCT, hemoglobin C
trait carriers, and noncarriers. APOL1 high-risk genotypes
were present in 12.8% (n=1142) of individuals, with similar
prevalence of APOL1 high-risk genotype among hemoglobin
trait groups. Baseline mean eGFR was significantly lower
and median urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)

 significantly higher among SCT carriers compared with non-
carriers (P,0.001 and P,0.001, respectively).
Association of SCT, Hemoglobin C Trait, and APOL1
High-Risk Genotypes with CKD and ESRD
Prevalent CKD was present in 272 of 739 (36.8%) individuals
with SCTand 63 of 243 (25.9%) participants with hemoglobin
C trait, compared with 2244 of 8927 (25.1%) blacks with nei-
ther SCT nor hemoglobin C trait. After adjusting for age, sex,
smoking status, diabetes, hypertension, and APOL1 high-risk
genotype status, individuals with SCT had an increased risk of
prevalent CKD compared with those without SCT (odds ratio
[OR], 1.89; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.59 to 2.23)
(Table 2). Hemoglobin C trait was not associated with in-
creased odds of prevalent CKD (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.71 to
1.31).
Themedianfollow-upforESRDwas6.49years.Theincidence
rate for ESRD was 8.5 per 1000 person-years for blacks with SCT
compared with 3.9 per 1000 person-years for hemoglobin C trait
and 4.0 per 1000 person-years for noncarriers. The adjusted
hazard ratio (HR) for ESRD comparing individuals with SCT
to those without SCTwas 2.03 (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.84) (Table 2).
Hemoglobin C trait was not associated with an increased risk of
incident ESRD (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.36 to 1.84).
In sensitivity analyses adjusting for principal components of
ancestry, theprevalence andincidence ofCKDand ESRD among
SCT, hemoglobin C carriers, and noncarriers were the same as in
the overall cohort. In this subcohort, risk estimates additionally
adjusting for genetic ancestry yielded similar results for risk of
CKD and ESRD for both SCTand hemoglobin C trait analyses as
in the overall cohort (Table 3).
APOL1 high-risk genotypes were present in 12.8% of
blacks without SCT or hemoglobin C trait, 12.0% of those
with SCT, and 12.3% of individuals with hemoglobin C trait.
The incidence rate for ESRD among individuals with APOL1
high-risk genotypes was 6.6 per 1000 person-years compared
with 3.8 per 1000 person-years in those without high-risk
genotypes. In the adjusted model, blacks with APOL1 high-
risk genotypes had 1.28 (95% CI, 1.1 to 1.4) higher odds of
prevalent CKD, and a 1.77 (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.4) higher hazard
of incident ESRD compared with those without high-risk ge-
notypes.
Interaction of SCT and Hemoglobin C Trait with APOL1
Variants
In order to assess the interaction between hemoglobin variants
and APOL1 high-risk genotypes, we performed a stratified anal-
ysis of prevalent CKD in individuals with and without APOL1
high-risk genotypes (Table 4). SCT did not interact with APOL1
high-risk genotypes in either the mainmodel or inthe sensitivity
analysis (P-interaction, 0.14 and 0.29, respectively).
Coinheritance of hemoglobin C trait and APOL1 high-risk
genotypes did appear to interact to further potentiate the risk
of prevalent CKD (P-interaction, 0.003). Subset analysis ad-
justing for principal components of ancestry, however, atten-
uated the strength of this interaction (P-interaction, 0.03),
with confidence intervals that overlapped between the
APOL1 strata (Table 5). Neither SCT nor hemoglobin C trait

only a single APOL1 renal risk allele (data not shown).
Subgroup Analyses by Baseline Hypertension,
Diabetes, and Socioeconomic Status
There were no significant interactions between hemoglobin C
trait and hypertension, diabetes, income, or education on the
risk of prevalent CKD (data not shown). SCT also did not
confer a differential risk among the subgroups defined by di-
abetes, income, or education. However, the association of SCT
with prevalent CKD differed significantly by hypertension
status (P-interaction, 0.01). Specifically, as shown in Table
6, among individuals with hypertension, SCT carriers had
1.63-fold (95% CI, 1.34 to 1.98) increased odds of prevalent
CKD compared with noncarriers, whereas among those with-
out hypertension, SCT was associated with a considerably
higher risk of prevalent CKD (OR, 2.94; 95% CI, 2.09 to
4.12) compared with those without SCT. This interaction
between SCT and hypertension status for prevalent CKD re-
mained significant on sensitivity analysis adjusting for prin-
cipal components of ancestry (P-interaction, 0.01; Table 7).
DISCUSSION
Blacks experience a substantially higher risk of progression to
ESRD than whites, but this increased risk cannot be explained
by environmental and clinical factors alone. Using a large,
population-based cohort from throughout the contiguous
United States, we found that SCT, a common hemoglobin
variant in blacks, was associated with a two-fold higher risk
of incident ESRD compared with noncarriers. This relation-
ship was independent of known risk factors for ESRD, includ-
ingage,hypertension,diabetes,andAPOL1high-riskgenotype
status. Our study demonstrates that SCT is not only a signif-
icant genetic risk factor for the development of ESRD in blacks,
but also that it confers a similar degree of risk for ESRD as
APOL1 high-risk genotypes, which are currently the most
widely recognized genetic variant associated with kidney dis-
ease in this population.5,10
The disproportionate burden of ESRD among blacks ap-
pears to be due to a higher rate of progression of CKD to
advanced-stage kidney disease, rather than increased risk of
baseline CKD itself.2,3 Although SCT has been associated with
CKD and albuminuria in prior large cohort analyses,6 cross-
sectional studies of SCT and ESRD have demonstrated
conflicting results. A study of black patients across four he-
modialysis units showed a two-fold increased prevalence of
SCT among blacks with ESRD compared with the expected
prevalence in that region.8 However, a subsequent case-
control study of blacks with ESRD and non-CKD controls
failed to show an association with SCT.9 Differences in the
design of these studies may have contributed to these disparate
findings, potentially through confounding in selection and
inadequate sample size. In addition, a previous meta-analysis
of five large United States–based general population cohorts

 investigated the association of SCTand CKD in blacks and was
unable to verify an association of SCTwith ESRD because of a
limited number of ESRD events in the available studies.6 In a
large, prospective population-based cohort with linkage to
United States Renal Data System (USRDS) data, we now dem-
onstrate that SCT is not only associated with prevalent CKD
but is also associated with progression to ESRD. SCT, there-
fore, importantly offers an additional genetic basis for the high
risk of advanced-stage kidney disease in blacks, independent
of APOL1.
Our findings have potentially far-reaching public policy
implications. Routine SCT screening is currently performed
in the United States as part of the Newborn Screening Program
for sickle cell disease, which has been in effect in a majority of
states since 1990 and in all 50 states since 2006.11,12 This is in
stark contrast to APOL1 high-risk genotypes, for which testing
is not generally performed in the clinical setting.13 Because
individuals with SCT are identified soon after birth, genetic
counseling about ESRD risk could allow for early CKD screen-
ing and risk factor modification such as smoking cessation,
weight loss, hypertension/glucose control, and avoiding neph-
rotoxic agents. Further investigation is needed to assess
whether these measures are effective in attenuating CKD
risk in this population. In addition, individuals at high
risk for SCT-related kidney disease may benefit from early
intervention. Renal protective therapies such as angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibition and targeted sickle disease–
modifying therapies such as hydroxyurea have shown efficacy
in decreasing albuminuria in patients with sickle cell dis-
ease.14,15 Future studies will be required to determine if similar
therapies are effective in SCT.
Although the pathophysiologyof nephropathy in SCTis not
yet understood, several mechanisms can be proposed on the
basis of the sickle cell disease literature. Injection radiographs
of the renal medulla have demonstrated vascular disruption in
individuals with homozygous SS disease and SCT compared
with those with normal hemoglobin, suggesting a common
pathway of renal injury in both genotypes.16 In sickle cell dis-
ease, the hypoxic environment of the renal medulla leads to
ischemic-reperfusion injury, release of vasoactive factors, hy-
perfiltration, and progressive glomerulosclerosis.17,18 An
analogous mechanism may underlie the risk of progression
to ESRD observed in adults with SCT.
Similar to prior studies,6,9 SCT and APOL1 renal risk
variants did not demonstrate a gene-gene interaction to po-
tentiate the risk of prevalent CKD in blacks in our analysis.
By contrast, in a study of sickle cell disease, the presence of
APOL1 high-risk genotypes conferred a three-fold increased
risk of prevalent albuminuria assessed by dipstick evalua-
tion.19 However, because APOL1 risk variants confer their
greatest risk with progression of CKD,13 a potentiating ef-
fect of APOL1 in SCT-related nephropathy may only be ap-
parent in the risk of eGFR decline or incident ESRD. We
were unable to evaluate this in the current analysis due to
relatively low numbers of ESRD events. Our study also
suggests a potential interaction between hemoglobin C trait
and APOL1 high-risk genotypes for prevalent CKD; how-
ever, this finding will need to be validated in other large
cohorts.
APOL1 renal risk variants increase susceptibility to cer-
tain variants of glomerular disease, including hypertension-
attributed nephropathy. Although the pathophysiologic
cause of this entity was historically ascribed to hypertension
itself, further studies have suggested that elevated BP is
likely a secondary rather than initiating event in these ca-
ses.20,21 In this study, SCT was associated with substantially
higher odds of CKD among nonhypertensive blacks com-
pared with those with hypertension. Individuals with sickle
cell disease have lower BPs than race-matched controls, and
although the reasons for this are unclear, it is speculated that
this relative hypotension may be due to impaired urinary
concentrating ability and urinary sodium loss from progres-
sive renal tubular damage.22,23 This hypothesized mecha-
nism suggests that relative hypotension may be a symptom
of renal dysfunction in SCT individuals, similar to hyperten-
sion in APOL1-related nephropathy, but whether SCT-
related nephropathy results in the same pathophysiologic
changes as sickle cell disease is unknown. In our study, we
did not have biopsy or clinical data to determine the cause of
CKD. Further studies are required to confirm this observa-
tion and to determine the role of SCT in progression of disease-
specific nephropathies.

 The strengths of our study include the large, population-
based sample of blacks with extensive data on measured risk
factors, including direct genotyping for both APOL1 and he-
moglobin S/C variants. We also had robust phenotypic out-
comes including linkage to USRDS ESRD data. Our study does
have limitations. We did not have alternate measures of kidney
function decline such as incident CKD in the current analysis.
In addition, we did not have data on genetic ancestry within
the entire cohort; however, a sensitivity analysis using a large
subset of our sample with available data revealed similar re-
sults as the primary analyses.
In conclusion, in a large, population-based study of blacks
from throughout the contiguous United States, SCTwas asso-
ciated with two-fold increased risk of progression to ESRD.
This degree of risk for ESRD was similar to that conferred by
APOL1 high-risk genotypes in a general black population. Un-
like APOL1, testing for SCT is widely performed in newborn
screening programs, in athletics, and in pregnancy counseling,
therefore, these findings may have immediate implications for
policy and treatment recommendations in SCT.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
TheREGARDScohortisalarge,population-basedcohortofblackand
white American adults of age$45 years, designed to investigate stroke
epidemiology in the United States. This study is described in detail
elsewhere.24 In brief, a total of 30,239 participants from the 48 con-
tiguous United States were enrolled in the study between January of
2003 and October of 2007. The study oversampled blacks and indi-
viduals from the stroke belt region (North Carolina, South Carolina,
Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas).
All participants provided informed consent, and the REGARDS study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the participating
centers.
Genotypic Assessment
All self-reported black participants consenting to genetic research
were genotyped for SCT, hemoglobin C trait, and APOL1 renal risk
variants (G1 and G2). Genotyping for the primary exposure vari-
ables, hemoglobin S (HbS) and hemoglobin C (HbC), was performed
using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems/Thermo
Fisher Scientific) as previously described.6 A subset of genotyped
samples (hemoglobin S: 244 homozygous normal and 15 heterozy-
gotes; hemoglobin C: 273 homozygous normal and six heterozy-
gotes) was selected for DNA sequencing on an Applied Biosystems
3730 DNA Sequencer and all sequence results were 100% concordant
with the TaqMan allele calls. Individuals with hemoglobin SS, SC, or
CC genotypes were excluded from further analysis. APOL1 high-risk
genotype was defined as the presence of two renal risk variants, G1/
G1, G2/G2, or G1/G2. A subset of participants had available genomic
array data (Illumina exome chip) to estimate population substructure
(n=6714).25 In sensitivity analyses, principal components of ancestry
were generated by Eigenstrat to adjust for ancestry in this subset.26
Covariate and Outcome Assessment
Baseline REGARDS study data were collected via telephone interview,
self-administeredquestionnaire,and in-home examination. Computer-
assisted telephone interviews administered by trained staff were used to
collect information on participant age, smoking status, education, and
self-reports of prior physician-diagnosed comorbid conditions. Trained
health professionals conducted in-home examinations, which included
height, weight, and BP measurements, collection of blood and spot
urine samples, and review of medication pill bottles.
Hypertension was defined by a baseline BP$140/90 mmHg or the
self-reported use of antihypertensive medication. Diabetes was de-
fined by a fasting serum glucose $126 mg/dl, nonfasting glucose
$200 mg/dl, or the use of antidiabetes medications. Socioeconomic
status was defined by education and income. Education was catego-
rized as less than high school, high school graduate, some college, or
college graduate and above. Income was categorized as ,$20,000/yr,
$20,000 to $34,999/yr, $35,000 to $74,999/yr, or $$75,000/yr.
Serum creatinine was measured by colorimetric reflectance spec-
trophotometry and calibrated to an international isotope dilution
mass spectroscopic–traceable reference standard. eGFR was esti-
mated from serum creatinine using the Chronic Kidney Disease Ep-
idemiology Collaboration equation.27 Spot UACR was measured by
nephelometry (BN ProSpec Nephelometer; Dade Behring, Marburg,
Germany) and by a Modular-P chemistry analyzer (Roche/Hitachi,
Indianapolis, IN).
Prevalent CKD was defined as a baseline eGFR,60 ml/min per
1.73 m2 and/or UACR$30 mg/g. Incident ESRD was defined by link-
age of the cohort to USRDS through 2013.28 Individuals with ESRD at
baseline were excluded.
Statistical Analyses
Logistic regression was used to calculate ORs and 95% CIs of prevalent
CKD associated with hemoglobin S or C carrier status, and Cox regres-
sion was used to calculate the HRs of incident ESRD. All analyses were
adjusted forage,sex,smoking,hypertension, diabetes, andAPOL1 high-
risk genotype status. We did not adjust for baseline eGFR as we con-
ceptualized it as part of the causal pathway. We tested for an interaction
between SCTor hemoglobin C trait and APOL1 high-risk genotypes in
relation to prevalent CKD by adding an interaction term to the regres-
sion model and by performing stratified analysis. Interaction analyses
were not performed on incident ESRD because of a relatively low num-
ber of events. To account for underlying genetic population structure in
blacks that might confound the association between SCT, hemoglobin
C, or APOL1 renal risk variants and kidney outcomes, we also
performed a sensitivity analysis using the subset of the sample with
available array genotypic data to adjust for global African ancestry using
the first ten principal components as described above. In addition, anal-
yses stratified by baseline hypertension, diabetes, and socioeconomic
status were evaluated.
