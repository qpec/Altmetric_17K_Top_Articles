ABSTRACT Influenza virus NS1 protein is a nonstructural, multifunctional protein
that counteracts host innate immune responses, modulating virus pathogenesis. NS1
protein variability in subjects infected with H3N2 influenza A viruses (IAVs) during
the 2010/2011 season was analyzed, and amino acid changes in residues 86, 189,
and 194 were found. The consequences of these mutations for the NS1-mediated in-
hibition of IFN responses and the pathogenesis of the virus were evaluated, showing
that NS1 mutations D189N and V194I impaired the ability of the NS1 protein to in-
hibit general gene expression, most probably because these mutations decreased
the binding of NS1 to the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor 30
(CPSF30). A recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) H1N1 virus encoding the H3N2
NS1-D189N protein was slightly attenuated, whereas the virus encoding the H3N2
NS1-V194I protein was further attenuated in mice. The higher attenuation of this vi-
rus could not be explained by differences in the ability of the two NS1 proteins to
counteract host innate immune responses, indicating that another factor must be re-
sponsible. In fact, we showed that the virus encoding the H3N2 NS1-V194I protein
demonstrated a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype, providing a most likely expla-
nation for the stronger attenuation observed. As far as we know, this is the first de-
scription of a mutation in NS1 residue 194 conferring a ts phenotype. These studies
are relevant in order to identify new residues important for NS1 functions and in hu-
man influenza virus surveillance to assess mutations affecting the pathogenicity of
circulating viruses.
IMPORTANCE Influenza viral infections represent a serious public health problem,
with influenza virus causing a contagious respiratory disease that is most effectively
prevented through vaccination. The multifunctional nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is
the main viral factor counteracting the host antiviral response. Therefore, influenza
virus surveillance to identify new mutations in the NS1 protein affecting the patho-
genicity of the circulating viruses is highly important. In this work, we evaluated
amino acid variability in the NS1 proteins from H3N2 human seasonal viruses and
the effect of the mutations on innate immune responses and virus pathogenesis.
NS1 mutations D189N and V194I impaired the ability of the NS1 protein to inhibit
general gene expression, and recombinant viruses harboring these mutations were
attenuated in a mouse model of influenza infection. Interestingly, a virus encoding
the H3N2 NS1-V194I protein demonstrated a temperature-sensitive phenotype, fur-
ther attenuating the virus in vivo.

nfluenza A virus (IAV) and influenza B virus (IBV) are members of the Orthomyxoviridae
family and contain a segmented genome of eight single-stranded RNA molecules
with negative polarity (1). Despite comprehensive vaccination programs, the WHO
estimates that the global disease burden from seasonal influenza results in 1 billion
infections, 3 to 5 million cases of severe disease, and between 300,000 and 500,000
deaths annually (2).
The defense mechanisms provided by the innate immune system restrict influenza
virus replication (3). Therefore, to efficiently replicate in interferon (IFN)-competent
systems, influenza viruses counteract host antiviral activities, especially the production
of IFNs and the activities of IFN-induced proteins that inhibit virus replication (4).
Influenza virus NS1 protein is translated from the colinear transcript of segment 8,
which also encodes the nuclear export protein (NEP) from a spliced mRNA (5). NS1
protein is a small, nonstructural, and multifunctional protein that mainly counteracts
the host innate immune responses (reviewed in references 4 and 6), allowing the virus
to efficiently replicate in IFN-competent systems. Accordingly, influenza viruses lacking
the NS1 protein or expressing reduced levels or truncated forms of the NS1 protein are
severely impaired in growth in IFN-competent cells and show pathogenicity only in
mice lacking key components of the type I IFN pathway, such as STAT1 or protein
kinase R (PKR) (7–12).
NS1 protein counteracts the host innate immune responses by several different
mechanisms, including the inhibition of IFN production by blocking posttranscriptional
RNA processing and nuclear export, decreasing retinoic acid inducible gene 1 (RIG-I)
activation through sequestration of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (13–15) or through
inhibition of tripartite motif family (TRIM)-25-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination (16), inter-
fering with IFN signaling and impairing the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs),
and directly inhibiting specific ISGs, such as PKR and RNase L (RNase L), by binding to
dsRNA and PKR directly (reviewed in references 4 and 6). To decrease general gene
expression, including upregulation of ISGs with antiviral activity, NS1 proteins from
some human IAVs bind to the 30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation
specificity factor (CPSF30), blocking the processing of cellular mRNAs (17–20), and to
poly(A)-binding protein II (PABPII), inhibiting the ability of PABPII to stimulate the
synthesis of long poly(A) tails (21). These two mechanisms block pre-mRNA processing
and the nuclear export of mRNAs (22), therefore leading to a general inhibition of host
gene expression. The IAV NS1 binding site for CPSF30 is centered around amino acid
186. However, NS1 amino acid residues 103 and 106 (17, 18, 23, 24), 108, 125, and 189
(25), and 64 (26) are important for CPSF30 binding.
Influenza viruses that possess temperature-sensitive (ts) mutations are consistently
attenuated in vivo compared with the wild-type (WT) parental strains (27). In fact, ts
virus mutants are currently used in several live attenuated virus vaccines (LAIVs) (28,
29). The attenuated phenotype of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved influenza H2N2 virus A/AA/6/60 used in LAIVs is conferred by just five point
mutations, located in PB2 (N265S), PB1 (K391E, E581G, and A661T), and NP (D34G), that
make the virus temperature sensitive (30, 31).
In addition, some mutations in the NS1 protein can confer a ts phenotype to the
virus by different mechanisms. NS1 mutant R25K shows a transcriptional block at the
nonpermissive temperature (32, 33), mutants K62N and A132T are affected in viral gene
expression at a posttranscriptional level (34), and mutants expressing only the first 81
and 110 amino acids of the NS1 protein showed deficiencies in at the nonpermissive
temperature (11). Influenza viruses lacking regions of the NS1 protein also present a ts
phenotype (35).
In this article, we describe mutations in residues 86, 189, and 194 in NS1 protein
found in human H3N2 viruses circulating in the 2010/2011 season and the effect of
these mutations on NS1 function, virus pathogenesis, and ts phenotype. Mutations
D189N and V194I impaired the ability of the NS1 protein to inhibit general gene
expression and, therefore, IFN antagonism, most likely because these mutations de-
creased the binding of NS1 to CPSF30. Interestingly, a recombinant A/Puerto Rico/8/34

 (PR8) H1N1 virus encoding the H3N2 NS1-D189N protein was slightly attenuated in
mice, whereas a PR8 virus encoding the H3N2 NS1-V194I protein was attenuated to a
greater extent. The virus encoding the D189N mutation did not show a ts phenotype;
however, the virus encoding the NS1-V194I protein did, providing a most likely expla-
nation for the stronger attenuation observed for this virus. As far as we know, this is the
first report that a mutation in NS1 residue 194 confers a ts phenotype.
RESULTS
Variability in NS1 protein sequence among influenza H3N2 virus clinical iso-
lates. To assess variability in the NS1 proteins of influenza A H3N2 viruses circulating
within the 2010/2011 season, the NS1 protein sequences of 7 clinical samples from the
2010/2011 season collected in the Rochester, NY, area were obtained. Clinical isolates
from subjects 54FUR0021 (S_21), 54FUR0038 (S_38), 54FUR0044 (S_44), and FAM0047
(S_F47) encoded the same NS1 sequence. However, subject 54FUR0040 (S_40) pre-
sented a D189N change, subject 54FUR0047 (S_47) presented a A86T change, and
subject FAM075 (S_F75) presented a V194I change (Table 1), indicating that there is
variability in the NS1 protein among viruses infecting people even within the same area
and season.
To analyze the prevalence of the mutations found in our samples, the sequences
from H3N2 NS1 proteins from human viruses circulating since 1968 (Influenza Research
database) were analyzed. Interestingly, from 6,980 sequences, 6,921 sequences con-
tained the A86 amino acid, 42 sequences contained the T86 amino acid, 8 sequences
contained an S86 amino acid, 5 sequences contained a V86 amino acid, and 4
sequences contained a D86 amino acid. From 6,980 sequences analyzed, 6,942 se-
quences contained the D189 amino acid, 37 sequences contained a G189 amino acid,
and 1 sequence contained an N189 amino acid. From 6,980 sequences analyzed, 6,948
sequences contained the V194 amino acid, 10 sequences contained the I194 amino
acid, 21 sequences contained a G194 amino acid, and 1 sequence contained an L194
amino acid (Table 2), showing that the mutations A86T, D189N, and V194I are present
in circulating viruses at low frequencies.
To analyze whether the low frequencies of the A86T, D189N, and V194I mutations
also apply to other influenza virus subtypes, such as human H1N1 and human 2009
pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1), NS1 protein sequences from the Influenza Research database
were further analyzed (Table 2). As observed for human H3N2 viruses, the frequencies
of other amino acids different than D or G at position 189 and V at position 194 were
very low (�0.83%) in all analyzed sequences. In contrast, the frequency of amino acid
T at position 86 was very high (100%) in pandemic H1N1 viruses (Table 2). These data
suggest that amino acids V194 and D189 are relevant for NS1 function(s), as other
amino acids at these positions are present at only very minor frequencies in H1N1,
pandemic H1N1, and H3N2 viruses and are likely not highly selected against other viral
variants.
Effect of NS1 changes on translation inhibition in an H3N2 background. One of
the mechanisms mediating the IAV NS1 protein ability to counteract innate immune
responses is the binding to CPSF30, leading to host gene expression suppression,

 including expression of IFN and ISGs with antiviral activities (17, 19). To analyze the
effect of NS1 changes on the inhibition of host gene expression, 293T cells were
cotransfected with plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Gaussia
luciferase (Gluc) and with plasmids encoding the different NS1 variants under the
control of a polymerase II promoter (36), or with the empty plasmid as internal control
(Fig. 1). Plasmids expressing the NS1 from A PR8 and 1918 strains were used as controls,
because it is known that they do not and do block general gene expression, respec-
tively (18). The expression of GFP was measured in a fluorescence microscope (Fig. 1A),
and the expression of Gluc was quantitated in a Lumicount luminometer (Fig. 1B) at 30
h posttransfection (hpt). As previously shown (18), the expression of 1918 NS1 protein
inhibited the expression of GFP and Gluc, whereas that of PR8 NS1 protein did not. NS1
proteins encoded by circulating H3N2 viruses inhibited general gene expression to
different extents (Fig. 1A and B). The levels of Gluc and GFP expression were similar in
cells expressing NS1 proteins containing A86 or T86 (Fig. 1A and B). In contrast, GFP and
Gluc expression was higher in cells expressing NS1 proteins including the mutations
D189N and to a lesser extent V194I, indicating that these mutations affect the ability of
the NS1 protein to block general gene expression. These results were further confirmed
when NS1 expression levels were analyzed by Western blotting. As expected, the NS1
proteins that efficiently blocked the expression of GFP and Gluc were barely detected
by Western blotting (Fig. 1C), consistent with the idea that different NS1 proteins block
the expression of cellular and viral genes to different extents.
Effect of NS1 changes on IFN responses in an H3N2 background. To analyze
whether the NS1 variants present differences in counteracting the innate immune
response, two complementary assays were performed. For the first one, 293T cells were
cotransfected with plasmids expressing the different NS1 proteins and plasmids ex-
pressing the firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter gene under control of the IFNB promoter
or of an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and a plasmid expressing Renilla
luciferase (Rluc) constitutively (Fig. 2). At 24 hpt, cells were mock infected or infected
with Sendai virus (SeV) (Cantell strain), to induce innate immune responses, and at 16
h postinfection (hpi), activation of the IFNB or ISRE promoter was determined by
quantifying the Fluc activities (Fig. 2A) and the levels of secreted IFN in tissue culture
supernatants were compared in a previously described bioassay (Fig. 2C). As expected,
SeV infection induced robust amounts of IFNB and ISRE promoter-driven Fluc activity
in cells transfected with the empty plasmid. In cells transfected with the different NS1
variants, the levels of Fluc activity were induced to different extents but always to
smaller amounts than in cells transfected with the empty plasmid, consistent with the
results showing that the influenza virus NS1 protein counteracts host innate immune

 responses (4). PR8 NS1 counteracted IFNB and ISRE promoter activation to lower
extents than 1918 NS1, most probably because PR8 NS1 only counteracts host innate
responses, whereas 1918 NS1 protein counteracts host innate immune responses and
blocks general gene expression (18) (Fig. 2A). As shown above (Fig. 1), mutation A86T
did not significantly affect the ability of the NS1 protein to counteract innate immune
responses induced after SeV infection. However, NS1 proteins containing the amino
acids asparagine at position 189 and isoleucine at position 194 counteracted gene
expression (as measured by IFNB promoter- and ISRE promoter-driven firefly luciferase
expression) to lower extents than NS1 proteins with aspartate or valine at positions 189
and 194, respectively (Fig. 2). This suggests that these proteins present a defect in
inhibiting gene expression, as measured by analyzing the constitutive expression of
GFP, Gluc (Fig. 1), and Rluc (Fig. 2B). In fact, the levels of constitutive Rluc expression in
these experiments were similar to those of GFP and Gluc (Fig. 1A and B), corroborating
that the mutations D189N and V194I decrease the ability of the NS1 protein to inhibit
general gene expression.
To analyze the levels of SeV infection-induced IFN in cells overexpressing the
different NS1 variants, tissue culture supernatants were UV inactivated and used to
treat A549 cells. As a control, cells were treated with 250 U/ml of universal IFNA. Cells

VSV-GFP expression and VSV-GFP titers were high in cells treated with tissue culture
supernatants from empty plasmid-transfected, mock-infected cells. In contrast, the
levels of VSV-GFP expression and VSV-GFP titers decreased in cells treated with tissue
culture supernatants from cells which were transfected with plasmids expressing
NS1-N189 (subject S_40) and NS1-I194 (subject S_F75), and infected with SeV, com-
pared to the cells transfected with NS1-D189-V194 (Fig. 2C). No significant differences
were observed in the cells treated with tissue culture supernatants from NS1-A86 or
NS1-A86-trasnfected cells (Fig. 2C). This bioassay result indicated that the levels of
secreted IFN induced after SeV infection were lower in cells transfected with NS1-N189
and -I194 than in cells transfected with NS1-D189-V194.

expressing an NS1 variant, VSV-GFP replicated with titers 5- to 1,000-fold higher in
poly(I·

 (Fig. 3B), consistent with the data showing that NS1 proteins counteract the innate
immune responses (reviewed in reference 4). However, there were qualitative differ-
ences among the different NS1 proteins. VSV-GFP titers were around 10-fold higher in
cells treated with poly(I·
C) (Fig. 3A) and IFN (Fig. 3B) and expressing 1918 NS1 than in
cells expressing PR8 NS1, consistent with the ability of 1918 NS1 to inhibit host protein
expression (Fig. 1 and 2). In addition, compared to the reference NS1-expressing cells,
VSV-GFP titers were 25-fold lower in poly(I·
C) (Fig. 3A)- and IFN (Fig. 3B)-treated cells
that expressed the D189N NS1 protein mutation. Similarly, compared to the reference
NS1 protein, VSV-GFP titers were reduced by 4- and 6-fold in poly(I·
C) (Fig. 3A)- and IFN
(Fig. 3B)-treated cells, respectively, expressing the NS1-V194I mutation. In contrast, NS1
protein mutation A86T had no significant effect on VSV-GFP growth (Fig. 3A and B).
These data correlate with data from Fig. 1 and 2 and show that the mutations D189N
and, to a lower extent, V194I diminish the capability of NS1 to antagonist cellular
antiviral responses.
Effect of NS1 changes on translation inhibition and host innate immune
responses in an H1N1 background. To further evaluate the effect of the mutations
D189N and V194I on the ability of another NS1 strain to inhibit protein synthesis and
counteract host innate immune responses, mutations D189N and V194I were intro-
duced in the 1918 strain NS1 protein. To analyze the effect of NS1 mutations on host
gene expression inhibition, 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing GFP
and Gluc and with the different plasmids encoding the 1918 NS1 variants, or with the
empty plasmid as a control. Mutations D189N and V194I decreased the ability of the
1918 NS1 protein to inhibit general gene expression, as measured by GFP (Fig. 4A) and
Gluc (Fig. 4B) levels. The expression of NS1 in the cellular lysates was analyzed by
Western blotting. As expected, the NS1 proteins that efficiently blocked the expression
of GFP and Gluc were barely detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4C), confirming that
mutations V194I and, to a greater extent, D189N decrease the ability of NS1 to inhibit
general gene expression using another NS1 protein strain.
To confirm that the mutations V194I and D189N affect innate immune responses
in the 1918 NS1 strain backbone, 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids express-
ing the different NS1 proteins together with plasmid pISRE-Fluc and a plasmid express-
ing the Rluc constitutively. At 24 hpt, the cells were mock-infected, infected with SeV,
or treated with IFNA for 16 h, and the activation of the IFNB promoter or an ISRE
promoter was determined by quantifying the Fluc activities (Fig. 5A). Fluc was ex-
pressed to larger amounts in cells transfected with plasmids expressing NS1-D189N and
NS1-V194I than in the 1918 WT strain (Fig. 5A), most probably because these proteins
have a defect in inhibiting host gene expression, as measured by analyzing the
constitutive expression of GFP, Gluc (Fig. 4A and B), and Rluc (Fig. 5B), further confirm-
ing that the mutations D189N and V194I decrease the ability of the NS1 protein to
counteract host innate immune responses within another strain.
To further analyze the effect of NS1 mutations D189N, and V194I on 1918 NS1
protein function, A549 cells were transfected with the plasmids encoding the 1918 NS1
variants and then treated with poly(I·
C) or IFNA, and at 16 h posttreatment, cells were
infected with VSV-GFP. The highest VSV-GFP titers were observed in the cells trans-
fected with the reference NS1 (WT-D189-V194) and treated with poly(I·
C) or IFNA,
followed by cells transfected with the NS1-V194 and the NS1-N189 1918 mutants,
which showed the lowest VSV-GFP titers (Fig. 5C). Altogether, these data indicate that
substitutions D189N and, to a lesser extent, V194I affect the ability of NS1 proteins to
counteract the cellular antiviral state.
Effect of D189N and V194I mutations on binding of NS1 to CPSF30. Our
previous data indicated that mutations D189N and V194I impair the IFN antagonist
function of NS1 by affecting its ability to block gene expression (Fig. 1 and 4). To assess
whether these mutations decrease the binding of NS1 to CPSF30, extracts from 293T
cells expressing CPSF30 fused to a FLAG tag were incubated with in vitro-transcribed
and translated NS1 proteins differing only at amino acid (aa) 189 and 194, or with the

After coimmunoprecipitation, CPSF30 protein was detected by Western blotting in all
cases (Fig. 6). As expected, PR8 NS1 was not coimmunoprecipitated with CPSF30,
consistent with previous results showing that PR8 NS1 does not interact with CPSF30
(18, 26). Interestingly, the reference NS1 protein (with D189 and V194) was coimmu-
noprecipitated with CPSF30, indicating that this NS1 protein and CPSF30 interact. The
amounts of coimmunoprecipitated NS1 proteins with I194, and more clearly N189, were
significantly smaller than the amount of the reference NS1 protein (with D189 and
V194), with levels of starting proteins used for the coimmunoprecipitation being similar
(Fig. 6). These results strongly suggest that the mutation D189N and, to a lesser extent,
V194I decrease the binding of NS1 to CPSF30, and provide a mechanism for impaired
NS1-mediated inhibition of host gene expression.

 V194I) viruses, which grew with titers around 10- to 500-fold lower than those of the r44
virus at 24, 48, and 72 hpi in both MDCK and A549 cells (Fig. 7). These data suggested
that the virus r40 and, particularly, the virus rF75 were impaired in growth.
To test whether the NS1-V194I or NS1-D189N protein diminishes the ability of the
protein to counteract host innate immune responses in the context of the virus
infection, MDCK cells constitutively expressing GFP and Fluc reporter genes under the
control of the IFNB promoter (MDCK IFNB-GFP/IFNB-Fluc) (38) were mock infected or
infected (MOI of 4) with the rF75 (mutation V194I), r40 (mutation D189N), or r44
(reference). Next, at 12 hpi, the activation of the IFNB promoter was determined by
evaluating GFP expression and quantifying the Fluc activities (Fig. 8A). Importantly,
comparable levels of infection in MDCK IFNB-GFP/IFNB-Fluc cells were verified by
immunofluorescence using an anti-NP HB-65 monoclonal antibody (MAb) (data not
shown). The levels of the GFP signals in these cells were a reflection of the amounts of
IFN produced in cells infected with the NS1 mutant viruses. The GFP signal was not
detected in mock-infected cells, as expected (data not shown). In r44 virus-infected
cells, very low levels of GFP expression were detected, consistent with the data showing
that the r44 virus counteracts the IFN response induced by the host. However, in cells
infected with the r40 and rF75 viruses, higher levels of GFP expression were observed
(Fig. 8A). Furthermore, this observation was quantified through a Fluc assay (Fig. 8A),
showing the highest levels of Fluc expression in cells infected with rF75, followed by
the r40 and, to a much lesser extent, r44 viruses. These data indicated that mutations
V194I and D189N impair the ability of the NS1 protein to counteract the host innate
immune responses in the context of influenza virus infection.

induced in cells (39). Therefore, as a second approach to analyze the IFN responses

 induced by the NS1 mutant viruses, inhibition of NDV-GFP infection was evaluated in
MDCK cells treated with the UV-inactivated tissue culture supernatants collected in the
first bioassay (Fig. 8B). The levels of inhibition of the replication of rNDV-GFP were
evaluated by GFP expression and were dependent of the amounts of IFN present in the
tissue culture supernatants of the cells infected with the different recombinant influ-
enza viruses (Fig. 8B). In cells pretreated with tissue culture supernatants from mock-
infected and, to a lesser extent, r44 virus-infected cells, rNDV-GFP replicated efficiently,
as evidenced by high-level GFP expression (Fig. 8B). However, the rNDV-GFP replication
was compromised in cells treated with tissue culture supernatants from rF75- and
r40-infected cells. Altogether, these data confirmed that infection with rF75 and r40
viruses induced an increased IFN type I response compared to that for infection with
the r44 virus.
Effect of D189N, and V194I mutations on virulence in vivo. To analyze whether
r40 (incorporating the NS1 mutation D189N) and rF75 (incorporating the NS1 mutation
V194I) viruses were attenuated in vivo, groups of mice were inoculated intranasally (i.n.)
with 50 (Fig. 9A) or 200 (Fig. 9B) focus-forming units (FFU) of viruses r44, r40, and rF75,
and mice were monitored during 14 days for signs of illness, weight loss, and mortality.
Using 50 FFU, mice infected with the r40 and r44 viruses lost around 20% of their initial
weight, and 20% and 40% of the mice, respectively, succumbed to viral infection (Fig.
9A). In contrast, mice infected with the virus rF75 did not significantly lose weight, and
all of them survived (Fig. 9A). Using 200 FFU, mice infected with the r40 and r44 viruses
rapidly lost weight (around 20 and 25%, respectively, by 8 days postinfection [dpi]), and
100% and 90% of the mice infected with the r40 and r44 viruses died or needed to be
euthanized by days 9 and 11 dpi, respectively (Fig. 9B). In contrast, mice infected with
the virus rF75 lost only 12% of their initial weight by day 10, and only 20% of the mice
succumbed to infection by day 11 (Fig. 9B). Altogether, these data indicate that virus
r40 is slightly attenuated, whereas virus rF75 is attenuated to a higher extent in vivo,
compared to the r44 virus.
To analyze whether virus attenuation correlates with virus titers in the lungs and
nasal mucosa, groups of 3 mice were infected intranasally with 200 FFU of r44 (as a
control), r40, and rF75, and virus titers in lungs extracted at days 1, 3, and 5 dpi and in
nasal mucosa extracted at 1 and 3 dpi were evaluated (Fig. 9C and D). In lungs, at 1 dpi,
low titers (around 102 FFU/ml) were detected in mice infected with the 3 viruses. At 3
dpi, virus titers were 100- and 10-fold lower in mice infected with the rF75 and r40
viruses, respectively, than in mice infected with the reference virus r44 (Fig. 9C),
whereas at day 5, the titers for these viruses were 10- and 3-fold lower, respectively (Fig.
9C). These data correlate with the virulence data and indicate that the r40 and,
remarkably, rF75 viruses are impaired in growth in lungs in vivo. In the nasal mucosa,
no infectious virus could be detected at 1 dpi, and low titers were detected at 3 dpi (Fig.
9D). Remarkably, titers at 3 dpi were similar in rF75, r40, and r44 virus-infected nasal
mucosa (Fig. 9D), suggesting that the impaired growth observed for the rF75 virus in
the lungs could be due to a ts phenotype conferred by the V194I mutation, not
emphasized in this anatomic site.
The presence of amino acid substitutions D189N and V194I was analyzed by
sequencing the viruses infecting the mouse lungs at 3 and 5 dpi (3 mice per time point).
No amino acid changes were observed within any virus (rF75, r40, and r44) suggesting
that the NS1 protein remains stable at least by day 5 postinfection (data not shown).
Mutation V194I confers a ts phenotype. The data showing that the rF75 virus
(with mutation V194I) was more attenuated than the r40 virus (with the mutation
D189N) were surprising and not likely explained by differences in the abilities of the
NS1 variants to counteract the host innate immune responses induced during viral
infection (Fig. 2 and 3). As it was previously shown that the growth in nasal turbinates
was similar for the rF75, r40, and r44 viruses, that a mutation in the contiguous position
(195) conferred a temperature-sensitive (ts) phenotype (40), and the LAIVs are attenu-
ated in vivo at least partially due to their ts phenotype (41), we sought to determine

C, and at 39°
C,
viral titers were at least 100-fold lower than those of the r44 virus at 24 and 48 hpi (Fig.
10A). To further confirm these results, a plaque assay was performed. Virus r40 showed
a plaque size similar to that of the r44 virus at 33, 37, and 39°
C (Fig. 10B). Interestingly,
whereas the lysis plaques produced by the rF75 virus at 33°
C were similar to those
produced by the r40 and r44 viruses, at 37°
C, the lysis plaques produced by the rF75
virus were smaller than those observed for r40 and r44. Notably, at 39°
C no lysis plaques
were observed for the rF75 virus compared to viruses r40 and r44, which produced clear
lysis plaques (Fig. 10B). These data indicated that whereas mutation D189N (r40) did
not affect the temperature sensitivity of the virus, mutation V194I (rF75) conferred on
the virus a ts phenotype. As far as we know, this the first time that a mutation in this
amino acid position in NS1 has been described as conferring a ts phenotype, providing
a likely explanation for the observed attenuation of the rF75 virus in vitro and in vivo.
DISCUSSION
The IAV NS1 protein allows the virus to efficiently replicate in IFN-competent
organisms, as it is the main viral protein counteracting the host innate immune
responses (4). Some reports have shown variability in the NS1 proteins from seasonal
IAVs (42–44) and that IAV strains circulating in humans in different seasons differ in the
ability of their NS1 proteins to block innate immune responses (43, 45). However, little
work has been done on analyzing NS1 variability in subjects infected within the same
area and same season. Previously, we found a mutation in the NS1 protein (I64T),
discovered in viruses isolated during the 2012/2013 season in the Rochester, NY, area,
that significantly diminishes the binding of NS1 protein to CPSF30, leading to increased
innate immune responses after infection and to a highly attenuated virus in mice (26).

 In the present work, we have extended this observation to subjects infected with H3N2
IAVs within the 2010/2011 season, showing that additional NS1 variants are found. In
fact, using a small number of infected subjects (7) we have found amino acid changes
at 3 amino acid positions (aa 86, 189, and 194), suggesting that the variability is not
unusual.
One mechanism leading to IFN response inhibition is mediated through the binding
of the NS1 protein to CPSF30 (17–20). This process blocks the processing of mRNAs,
suppressing the expression of IFN and ISGs, many of which display antiviral activity (3).
Mutations D189N and V194I, but not mutation A86T, found in infecting viruses dimin-
ished the ability of NS1 protein to inhibit general gene expression in both the H3N2 and
1918 H1N1 backbones (Fig. 1, 4, and 5), most probably due to the decreased binding
of the NS1 to the CPSF30 (Fig. 6). It was previously described that the binding site for
CPSF30 is centered around amino acid 186 (19). In addition, amino acid residues 103
and 106 (17, 18, 23, 24) and residues 108, 125, and 189 (25) are important for NS1
binding to CPSF30 for PR8 and pH1N1 viruses, respectively. Similar to our results, a
mutation in amino acid 189 (D189G) decreased the ability of the pandemic H1N1
California/4/2009 NS1 protein to inhibit general gene expression and binding to
CPSF30 (25). Interestingly, as far as we know, this is the first report that a mutation at
position 194 affects the binding of NS1 to CPSF30.
Two complementary experiments using plasmids expressing the different NS1
variants (Fig. 2 and 3) or the NS1 proteins expressed in the context of viral infection (Fig.
8) both indicate an effect on induction of type I IFN responses. These experiments
showed that mutations D189N and V194I impaired the ability of NS1 to inhibit host
gene expression, thereby decreasing the ability of NS1 to counteract host innate
immune responses. Accordingly, previous results with NS1 proteins from H1N1, H7N9,
and H5N1 viruses showed that decreasing NS1-mediated inhibition of host gene
expression correlated with increased innate immune responses after infection (23–25).
IAV genome segment 8 encodes the NS mRNA as a continuous primary transcript.
Standard processing of this NS mRNA generates NS1, whereas alternative processing
using a weak 5= splice site results in a second, less abundant splice product encoding
NEP (46). To study NS1 and NEP independently of one another, it is necessary to have
a means to express the mRNAs separately. Therefore, we developed a novel reverse
genetics system encoding a recombinant virus with NS1 and NEP genes expressed
separately (37). This system allowed us to investigate the sequence encoding NS1
amino acids 189 and 194, which overlaps the sequence encoding NEP. With standard
processing it would have been impossible to introduce mutations in the NS1 gene
without affecting the NEP gene in the WT virus. Interestingly, viruses expressing all the
genes from H1N1 PR8 strain were compatible with the NS1 genes from circulating
H3N2 viruses. The reference virus (r44) grew with high titers either in vitro (particularly
in MDCK cells) or in mouse lung (Fig. 7 and 9C, respectively). In contrast, the rF75 and,
to a lesser extent, r40 viruses grew to lower titers, particularly in A549 cells and mouse
lungs (Fig. 7 and 9C, respectively). These data correlated with the lower virulence
observed for the r40 and, particularly, virus rF75 viruses (Fig. 9A and B). Our results
indicate that at least one factor explaining the differences in virus growth among the
rF75, r40, and r44 viruses could be the higher IFNB induction at early time points after
infection with viruses rF75 and r40 compared to r44 (Fig. 8). In agreement with our
results, increasing the binding of NS1 protein to CPSF30 in H7N9 and H5N1 NS1
proteins by introducing the mutations L103F and I106M led to decreased type I IFN
responses after infection, augmented virus titers in vivo, and increased virulence in mice
(24, 47). These results are in accordance with our previous work showing that an NS1
mutation (I64T) impairing the binding of NS1 to CPSF30 led to increased innate
immune responses after infection, decreased virus titers in vivo, and resulted in virus
attenuation (26).
Surprisingly, the virus rF75 was more impaired in growth and pathogenicity in
mouse lungs than the virus r40, whereas virus titers in the nasal mucosa were similar
(Fig. 9). These observations could not be explained by differences in antagonism of

 innate immune responses between both viruses, as our data indicated that the NS1
protein from r40 (less attenuated in vivo) was slightly more impaired in counteracting
host innate immune responses than the rF75 NS1 protein (Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). Instead
we found that rF75 showed a ts phenotype, while r40 did not (Fig. 10), providing an
explanation for the further attenuation observed for rF75 with a mutation at position
194 (Fig. 9). Accordingly, it has been shown that viruses possessing other ts mutations
are consistently attenuated in vivo compared to the original strains (27), being highly
impaired in growth in mice, hamsters, and ferrets (31, 41, 48, 49). In fact, ts virus
mutants are currently used in the LAIV approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Admin-
istration (FDA) (28, 29). Therefore, the novel NS1 mutation V194I could be introduced
in the current LAIV to further to attenuate the vaccine virus. Similarly to our results, it
was previously shown that a mutation in the contiguous position of the NS1 protein
(position 195) conferred a ts phenotype, leading to impaired virus growth at 39°
C (40),
and that viruses expressing only the N-terminal first 81 or 110 amino acids also showed
a ts phenotype (11). However, the molecular mechanism leading to the ts phenotype
of the virus with the NS1-V194I mutation needs further investigation.
Clinical symptoms such as runny nose, sore throat, cough, and fever were recorded
for each patient at the acute visit (Table 3). Interestingly, the patient infected with the
virus with the NS1-attenuating mutation V194I (S_F75), a 4-year-old child at the day of
enrollment, showed sore throat and fever that were severe compared to the case for
the other patients, who showed mild or moderate sore throat and no or less fever
(Table 3). In addition, this same patient S_F75 presented influenza-like symptoms 7
times during the period of enrollment (between December 2009 and June 2012). The
mean score for influenza-like symptoms presented by 19 subjects �5 years old enrolled
in the study was lower (3.10 � 2.05), suggesting that the subject infected with the
NS1-V194I virus might present host defects making him or her more prone to suffer
respiratory illnesses.
Altogether, the data presented in this work show there is sequence and functional
variability in circulating seasonal influenza viruses that infect humans. Analyzing the
NS1 sequences from human influenza viruses for NS1 protein variability and function
represents a valid strategy to identify novel mutations affecting innate immune re-
sponses and pathogenicity in vivo, which is an important objective of human surveil-
lance studies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design and human subjects. Human subjects were enrolled either in an “acute influenza”
surveillance protocol or from a prospective “family flu”surveillance study. Individuals reporting influenza-
like illness (fever, cough, and rhinitis) were asked to visit the Vaccine Research Unit (VRU) at University
of Rochester for nasal washes/swabs and blood sampling. The study was approved by the University of
Rochester Human Research Subjects Review Board (IRB protocol numbers 09-0034 and 07-0046).
Informed written individual or parental consent was obtained for each participant.
NS1 sequencing. RNA was obtained from 300 �l of patient nasal washes/swabs using the QIAamp
viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’
s instructions. Reverse transcription (RT)
reactions were performed during 2 h at 37°
C using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit
(Applied Biosystems) and the primers NS1-NCR-5=-VS (5=-AGCAAAGCAGGAGTAAAGATGAATCC-3=, com-

the same NS1-NCR-5=-VS and NEP-3=-RS primers. Amplified PCR products were used for Sanger sequenc-
ing (Genewiz).
Cells. Canine kidney epithelial (MDCK; ATCC CCL-34), human embryonic kidney (293T; ATCC CRL-
11268), human lung epithelial carcinoma (A549; ATCC CCL-185), and African green monkey kidney
epithelial (Vero; ATCC CCL-81) cells were grown at 33, 37, or 39°

Dulbecco’
s modified Eagle’
s medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(Gibco), 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 50 �g/ml gentamicin (Gibco).
Plasmids. Polymerase II expression pCAGGS plasmids (36) encoding NS1 sequences fused to a
hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) at the N terminus (14) were obtained using the primers
indicated in Table 4. To abolish NS mRNA splicing, two silent mutations were introduced at nt 501 and
504 of the NS1 gene (highlighted in bold in Table 4). Reverse transcription (RT) reactions were performed
at 37°
C for 2 h using the high-capacity cDNA transcription kit, the VS and RS primers (from PCRs 1 and
2, respectively) described in Table 4, and the RNAs obtained from subjects S_40, S_44, S_47, and S_F75
to obtain the cDNAs. Overlapping PCRs using the Pfx polymerase (Invitrogen) and primers and template
cDNAs described in Table 4 were used to amplify the viral NS1 protein. PCR products were cloned in the
pCAGGS-HA-NH2 expression plasmid (14) using SphI and NheI restriction enzymes. pCAGGS plasmids
encoding the NS1 proteins of the influenza A PR8 and influenza A/Brevig Mission/01/1918 (1918) H1N1
viruses were previously described (14, 18).
To introduce mutations D189N and V194I into the NS1 protein of 1918 NS1, overlapping PCRs were
performed using the primers described in Table 5, with the pCAGGS-HA-NH2 NS1-1918 plasmid (18) as
the template. PCR products were digested with SmaI and XhoI and cloned into pCAGGS-HA-NH2 (14).
Plasmids encoding NS1 variants under the control of the phage T7 polymerase promoter were obtained
by subcloning the NS1 from the pCAGGS-HA-NH2 plasmids into plasmid pcDNA3 using EcoRI and XbaI
restriction enzymes. Plasmids encoding PR8 and 1918 NS1 proteins under the control of the T7
polymerase promoter have been previously described (18).
The NS1 genes of IAV H3N2 S_40, S_44, and S_F75 were cloned in the previously described pDZ
plasmid encoding nonoverlapping NS1 and NEP ORFs (pDZ-NSs) (37). NS1 ORFs were amplified by PCR

 GCTGTTCTCGC-3=, containing a BsmBI restriction site, the last 25 nt of the NS1 ORF excluding the stop
codon, and 18 nt of the porcine teschovirus [PTV] 2A autoproteolytic site). We used plasmid pCAGGS-
HA-NH2 encoding the different NS1 variants as templates. PCR products were digested with the EcoRI
and BsmBI restriction enzymes and cloned into the pDZ-NSs plasmid (37). The sequences of all the
plasmids generated were confirmed (Genewiz).
Virus rescue. Cocultures (1/1) of 293T/MDCK cells in 6-well plates (106 cells/well) were cotransfected,
in suspension, with 1 �g of the seven ambisense wild-type (WT) plasmids (pDZ-PB2, -PB1, -PA, -HA, -NP,
-NA, and -M) of influenza A PR8 H1N1 virus (kindly provided by A. Garcia-Sastre, Icahn School of Medicine
at Mount Sinai, New York, NY) plus the ambisense split NS plasmids (pDZ-NSs) encoding the NS1 proteins
of IAV S_F75, S_40, or S_44, using DNA-IN (Molecular Transfec, Inc.) (50). Transfection medium was
replaced at 12 h posttransfection (hpt) with DMEM containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (BSA),
antibiotics, and 1 �g/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma).
At 48 hpt, tissue culture supernatants were collected and used to infect fresh MDCK cells. At 72 hpi,
recombinant viruses were plaque purified and scaled up in MDCK cells. Virus stocks were generated by
infecting confluent MDCK cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.001). Stocks were titrated by
immunofocus assay (FFU/ml) on MDCK cells. The identity of the NS1 ORFs in the rescued viruses was
confirmed by restriction analysis and sequencing of reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-amplified seg-
ments (Genewiz).
Virus titrations. IAVs were titrated in MDCK cells by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml). To this end,
confluent plates of MDCK cells (96-well format, 5 � 104 cells/well) were infected with 10-fold serial
dilutions of tissue culture supernatants. At 8 h postinfection (hpi), cells were fixed and permeabilized
using 4% formaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min at room
temperature. The cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated in 2.5% BSA in PBS blocking
solution for 1 h at room temperature, washed 3 times with PBS, and incubated with the IAV NP
monoclonal antibody (MAb) HB-65 (ATCC, H16-L10-4R5) diluted in 1% BSA for 2 h at 37°
C. After washing
3 times with PBS, cells were incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit
anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Dako) diluted 1:1,000 in 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h at 37°
C. IAV
NP-positive cells were visualized and enumerated to determine virus titers (FFU/ml) using a fluorescence
microscope. All virus infections were performed in the presence of 1 �g/ml of tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl
chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma).
Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP) (51) was titrated by
plaque assay (PFU/ml) in Vero cells. Confluent cell monolayers (12-well format, 3.75� 105 cells/well) were
infected with 10-fold serial dilutions for 1 h at room temperature, overlaid with DMEM containing agar,
and incubated at 37°
C. Viral plaques were visualized and counted at 1 day postinfection (dpi) using
crystal violet staining.
Virus growth kinetics. To determine virus growth rates in cell cultures, confluent monolayers of
MDCK or A549 cells (24-well format, 2 � 105 cells/well) were infected in duplicates at a low MOI (0.001
and 0.1, respectively). After 1 h of virus adsorption at room temperature, cells were washed and overlaid
with DMEM containing 0.3% BSA, antibiotics, and TPCK-treated trypsin (1 �g/ml for MDCK cells and 0.25
�g/ml for A549 cells) and incubated at 33, 37, or 39°
C. At the indicated times postinfection, tissue culture
supernatants were collected, and viral titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml) as
described above.
Plaque assay and immunostaining. Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells in 6-well plates (106
cells/well) were infected for 1 h at room temperature, overlaid with 2� DMEM containing 0.6% agar, and
incubated at 33, 37, or 39°
C. At 72 hpi, cells were fixed overnight with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and
the overlays were removed. Cells were then permeabilized (0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min at room
temperature and prepared for immunostaining using the viral NP MAb (HB-65) and vector kits (Vectastain
ABC vector kits and DAB horseradish peroxidase [HRP] substrate kit; Vector) according to the manufac-
turer’
s specifications.
Bioassays to assess IFN production and signaling. To evaluate the effect of NS1 protein on the
induction of IFN mediated by Sendai virus (SeV) (Cantell strain) infection, triplicate wells (96-well plate
format, 6 � 104 cells/well) of human 293T cells were cotransfected (using calcium phosphate) with 100
ng/well of the pCAGGS-HA-NH2 NS1 plasmids or the empty plasmid as a control, 50 ng/well of plasmids
expressing firefly luciferase (Fluc) under the control of the IFNB (pIFNB-Fluc) or the IFN-stimulated
response element (ISRE) (pISRE-Fluc) promoter (18), and 20 ng/well of a reporter plasmid expressing the
Renilla luciferase (Rluc) under the control of the constitutively active simian virus 40 (SV40) promoter
(pRL-SV40) (Promega). At 24 hpt, cells were infected with SeV (18), and at 16 hpi, cells were lysed using
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, and complete protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°
C,
and an equal volume of luciferase reporter buffer (Promega) was added. Fluc protein expression levels
were quantified in a Lumicount luminometer. In addition, at 16 h after SeV infection, tissue culture
supernatants were collected and SeV in tissue culture supernatants was inactivated by exposure to
short-wave (254-nm) UV radiation for 40 min at a distance of 6 cm (10). Fresh human A549 cells (96-well
plate format, 6 � 104 cells/well, triplicates) were treated with the UV-inactivated tissue culture super-
natants for 24 h and then infected (MOI, 0.001) with VSV-GFP for 16 h (10). GFP expression was analyzed
under a fluorescence microscope, and VSV-GFP infectious virus was titrated in Vero cells as described
above.
To measure the levels of IFN produced in IAV-infected cells, confluent monolayers of MDCK cells
(24-well plate format, 5 � 104 cells/well, triplicates) constitutively expressing GFP and Fluc reporter genes
under the control of the IFNB promoter (MDCK IFNB-GFP/IFNB-Fluc) (38) were mock infected or infected

 (MOI, 4) with either rF75, r40, or r44 virus. At 12 hpi, activation of the IFNB promoter was determined by
assessing GFP expression under a fluorescence microscope or by quantifying Fluc expression in cell
lysates using a Promega luciferase reporter assay and a Lumicount luminometer. Influenza virus infection
levels were evaluated by immunofluorescence using the anti-NP MAb HB-65 as described above. In
addition, tissue culture supernatants of infected MDCK cells were collected, and viruses were UV
inactivated as previously described (10). Fresh MDCK cells seeded in 96-well plates (4 � 105 cells/well)
were treated (triplicate wells) with the UV-inactivated tissue culture supernatants for 24 h and then
infected with a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) expressing GFP (NDV-GFP) (MOI, 5) (10). The GFP intensity
was measured at 24 hpi with a microplate reader (DTX880; Beckman Coulter), and images from
GFP-expressing cells were obtained in a fluorescence microscope. GFP expression by mock-treated cells
was considered to have a value of 100%. Mean values and standard deviations (SDs) were calculated
using Microsoft Excel software.
Inhibition of host protein expression. To evaluate the effect of IAV NS1 on host protein synthesis,
confluent monolayers of human 293T cells (96-well plate format, 6 � 104 cells/well, triplicates) were
transiently cotransfected, using DNA-IN, with 200 ng/well of pCAGGS-HA-NH2 NS1 expression plasmids,
or the empty plasmid as control, together with 50 ng/well of pCAGGS plasmids expressing GFP (18) and
Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) (52). GFP and Gluc expression levels were measured at 30 hpt using fluorescence
microscopy and a Lumicount luminometer, respectively. For Gluc measurements, tissue culture super-
natants were mixed with an equal volume of Biolux Gaussia luciferase reagent (New England BioLabs).
Western blotting. To evaluate protein expression levels by Western blotting, cells were lysed in
passive lysis buffer (Promega) containing Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) and �-mercaptoethanol and
boiled for 5 min before 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad)
and detected using primary rabbit anti-HA (NS1), anti-FLAG (CPSF30) polyclonal antibodies diluted
1:1,000 (Sigma-Aldrich H6908 and F7425, respectively) and antiactin MAb diluted 1:2,000 (Sigma-Aldrich
A1978), following by incubation with a 1:1,000 dilution of goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse IgG
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich). Proteins were detected by chemilu-
minescence using the SuperSignal West Femto maximum-sensitivity substrate (Thermo Scientific) fol-
lowing the manufacturer’
s recommendations. Western blots were quantified by densitometry using
ImageJ software (v1.46).
Bioassay to determine NS1 IFN antagonism. Triplicate wells of human A549 cells (96-well format,
3 � 104 cells/well) were transiently transfected with 200 ng/well of the pCAGGS-HA-NH2 NS1 plasmids,
or the empty plasmid as control, using DNA-IN according to the manufacturer’
s instructions. Cells were
transfected 24 h later with 100 ng of poly(I·
C) (Sigma) using DNA-IN or treated with 250 U/ml of universal
IFN� (Axxora). Sixteen hours after poly(I·
C) or IFN� treatment, cells were infected (MOI, 0.001) with the
VSV-GFP (51). VSV-GFP titers in the tissue culture supernatants were determined at 21 hpi by plaque
assay as described above.
Interaction of NS1 proteins with CPSF30. Human 293T cells (6-well format, 1.5 �106 cells/well)
were transiently transfected with 8,000 ng of a pCAGGS plasmid expressing a FLAG-tagged version of the
human CPSF30 (18). At 30 hpt, cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA,
5% glycerol and 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with a complete Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Pierce).
In parallel, HA-tagged NS1 variants were synthesized in vitro using the pcDNA3 plasmids and the TNT7
transcription/translation kit (Promega), following the manufacturer’
s recommendations. Cleared cell
lysates expressing FLAG-CPSF30 were incubated overnight at 4°
C with the in vitro-synthesized NS1
proteins and 20 �l of an anti-FLAG affinity resin (Sigma-Aldrich). After extensive washing, precipitated
proteins were dissociated from the resin using disruption buffer and high temperature (95°
C) and were
analyzed by Western blotting as described above using rabbit anti-HA (NS1) and anti-FLAG (CPSF30)
specific polyclonal antibodies.
Mouse experiments. Female 6-week-old C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory
and maintained in the animal care facility at the University of Rochester in a pathogen-free environment.
All animal protocols were approved by the University of Rochester Committee of Animal Resources
(101431-UCAR-2006-029R), in accordance with the standards established by the U.S. Animal Welfare Act
as set forth by the National Institutes of Health guidelines. Mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (Avertin) and then inoculated intranasally (i.n.) with 30 �l of the indicated
recombinant influenza A PR8 NS split viruses encoding the NS1 proteins from subjects S_F75, S_40, and
S_44 (rF75, r40, and r44, respectively) and monitored daily for morbidity (body weight loss, n � 5 to 8)
and mortality (survival, n � 5 to 8) for 2 weeks. Mice showing more than 25% loss of body weight were
considered to have reached the experimental endpoint and were humanely euthanized.
To sequence the NS1 gene from infected mouse lungs, 3 mouse lungs were removed at 3 and 5 dpi
and incubated in RNAlater (Ambion) at 4°
C for 24 h prior to freezing at �80°
C. Lungs were then
homogenized in RNA lysis buffer (Qiagen) using the gentleMACS dissociator (Miltenyi). Total RNA was
extracted using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). RT and PCRs were performed as described above. Primer
2A-RS (5=-TTTCTTCCACATCGCCCGC-3=) was used for sequencing (Genewiz).
Virus replication was evaluated by determination of viral titers in the lungs at 1, 3, and 5 dpi and in
the nasal mucosa at 1 and 3 dpi. To that end, mice (n � 3) were sacrificed, and nasal mucosa and lungs
were extracted and homogenized. Virus titers were determined by immunofocus assay (FFU/ml) as
indicated above. Geometric mean titers (GMTs) and statistical analyses (Mann-Whitney test) were
performed using GraphPad Prism software.
