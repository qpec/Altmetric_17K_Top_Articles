ABSTRACT
Objective
To assess the efficacy of arthroscopic subacromial 
decompression (ASD) by comparing it with diagnostic 
arthroscopy, a placebo surgical intervention, and with 
a non-operative alternative, exercise therapy, in a 
more pragmatic setting.
DeSiGN
Multicentre, three group, randomised, double blind, 
sham controlled trial.
SettiNG
Orthopaedic departments at three public hospitals in 
Finland.
ParticiPaNtS
210 patients with symptoms consistent with shoulder 
impingement syndrome, enrolled from 1 February 
2005 with two year follow-up completed by 25 June 
2015.
iNterveNtiONS
ASD, diagnostic arthroscopy (placebo control), and 
exercise therapy.
MaiN OutcOMe MeaSureS
Shoulder pain at rest and on arm activity (visual 
analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 100, with 0 denoting 
no pain), at 24 months. The threshold for minimal 
clinically important difference was set at 15.
reSultS
In the primary intention to treat analysis (ASD versus 
diagnostic arthroscopy), no clinically relevant between 
group differences were seen in the two primary 
outcomes at 24 months (mean change for ASD 36.0 at 
rest and 55.4 on activity; for diagnostic arthroscopy 
31.4 at rest and 47.5 on activity). The observed mean 
difference between groups (ASD minus diagnostic 
arthroscopy) in pain VAS were −4.6 (95% confidence 
interval −11.3 to 2.1) points (P=0.18) at rest and 
−9.0 (−18.1 to 0.2) points (P=0.054) on arm activity. 
No between group differences were seen between 
the ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy groups in the 
secondary outcomes or adverse events. In the 
secondary comparison (ASD versus exercise therapy), 
statistically significant differences were found in 
favour of ASD in the two primary outcomes at 24 
months in both VAS at rest (−7.5, −14.0 to −1.0, 
points; P=0.023) and VAS on arm activity (−12.0, 
−20.9 to −3.2, points; P=0.008), but the mean 
differences between groups did not exceed the pre-
specified minimal clinically important difference. Of 
note, this ASD versus exercise therapy comparison is 
not only confounded by lack of blinding but also likely 
to be biased in favour of ASD owing to the selective 
removal of patients with likely poor outcome from the 
ASD group, without comparable exclusions from the 
exercise therapy group.
cONcluSiONS
In this controlled trial involving patients with a 
shoulder impingement syndrome, arthroscopic 
subacromial decompression provided no benefit over 
diagnostic arthroscopy at 24 months.

Introduction
Management of shoulder pain has been estimated to 
account for 4.5 million visits to physicians and $3bn 
(£2.3bn; €2.6bn) financial burden each year in the 
US alone.1 2 As 44-70% of patients with shoulder pain 
are diagnosed as having a shoulder impingement 
syndrome, annual direct medical costs of this 
complaint are estimated at more than $1bn in the 
US.3-5 The pathognomonic clinical sign of shoulder 
impingement syndrome, subacromial shoulder pain 
while lifting the arm, is commonly attributed to 
“impingement” of the rotator cuff tendons between the 
humeral head and the overlying acromion. Premised 
on this rationale, the undersurface of the acromion 
is smoothened to decompress the passage of the 
rotator cuff tendon through the subacromial space in a 
surgical procedure called subacromial decompression.

Although various non-operative treatment modalities 
are recommended as initial treatment for patients 
with shoulder impingement symptoms,6 7 subacromial 
decompression has become one of the most frequently 
performed orthopaedic procedures in the world.8 With 
the advent of arthroscopy, the number of subacromial 
decompression procedures has increased many times 
between the 1980s and the 2010s.9 10 We conducted 
a multicentre, randomised, double blind, placebo 
surgery controlled trial to assess the efficacy of 
arthroscopic subacromial decompression (ASD) in 
patients with shoulder symptoms consistent with 
shoulder impingement syndrome.
Methods
trial design
We conducted this superiority trial at three orthopaedic 
clinics in Finland from 1 February 2005 to 25 June 
2015. Details of the trial design and conduct have 
been published elsewhere.11 The patients, the people 
who collected and analysed the data, and those who 
interpreted the principal findings for the ASD versus 
diagnostic 
arthroscopy 
comparison 
(see 
below, 
“Blinded data interpretation”) were unaware of the 
study group assignments. On entering the study, 
patients were unequivocally informed that they might 
undergo diagnostic arthroscopy and that they would 
be allowed to consider crossing over to ASD if they did 
not have adequate relief of symptoms, preferably no 
sooner than six months after randomisation.
Participants
We enrolled patients aged 35-65 years who had 
subacromial pain (for more than three months) 
that was unresponsive to conventional conservative 
treatment and had clinical findings consistent with 
shoulder impingement syndrome. All patients had 
magnetic resonance imaging with intra-articular 
contrast to exclude a rotator cuff tear. Detailed 
inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in table 
S1 in appendix 2.
randomisation and blinding
In an attempt to obtain three balanced study groups 
of similar size, we planned a twofold, sequential 
randomisation as follows. Firstly, during the baseline 
appointment, patients were randomised to surgical 
or conservative treatment (exercise therapy) in a 2:1 
ratio. Patients randomised to exercise therapy started 
standardised physiotherapy within two weeks of the 
baseline appointment, whereas those allocated to 
surgery were scheduled for surgery with the aim of 
carrying out the procedure within 12 weeks of this 
first randomisation. In patients allocated to surgery, 
we did a diagnostic arthroscopy to rule out a rotator 
cuff tendon tear and other obvious intra-articular 
pathology needing surgical treatment. If we found 
a full or a partial thickness rotator cuff tear large 
enough to need repair (grade III) according to clinical 
practice guidelines,12 we excluded the patient and 
repaired the tear. Patients with a partial tear that did 
not need repair (grade I and II) were included in the 
study. If the eligibility of the patient was confirmed in 
diagnostic arthroscopy, the surgeon asked a research 
nurse to carry out the second randomisation by 
opening an envelope containing the study group 
assignment (ASD or diagnostic arthroscopy; ratio 1:1). 
Only the orthopaedic surgeon and other staff in the 
operating room were made aware of the surgical group 
assignment, and they did not participate in further 
treatment or follow-up of the patient.
Randomisation was carried out using sequentially 
numbered 
sealed 
opaque 
envelopes. 
Separate 
randomisation lists for each of the three centres, with 
blocks varying randomly in size, were prepared by a 
statistician with no involvement in the clinical care of 
participants in the trial.
Study interventions
Exercise therapy
Supervised, 
progressive, 
individually 
designed 
physiotherapy was started within two weeks of 
randomisation, using a standardised protocol that 
relied primarily on daily home exercises as well as 15 
visits to an independent physiotherapist (the detailed 
exercise therapy protocol is available in appendix 1).13
Diagnostic arthroscopy
We carried out arthroscopic examination of the 
glenohumeral joint and subacromial space with 
the use of standard posterior and lateral portals 
 on 1 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

and a 4 mm arthroscope with the patient under 
general anaesthesia, usually supplemented with an 
interscalene brachial plexus block. We did an intra-
articular and subacromial assessment of the rotator 
cuff integrity. If the rotator cuff insertion could not be 
otherwise visualised, subacromial bursal tissue was 
bluntly stretched with a trochar or resected, keeping the 
resection to a minimum. If arthroscopic examination 
showed any pathology needing intervention other than 
ASD, we excluded the patient from the trial (fig 1). 
Once the eligibility was confirmed, the participants 
were randomly assigned to either ASD or diagnostic 
arthroscopy. For those allocated to the diagnostic 
arthroscopy group, the operation was terminated. To 
ensure concealment of the allocation from participants 
and the staff other than those in the operating theatre, 
the diagnostic arthroscopy participants were kept in 
the operating theatre for the time needed to perform 
subacromial decompression.
Arthroscopic subacromial decompression
After arthroscopic examination of the shoulder (that 
is, diagnostic arthroscopy), the ASD procedure, which 
involved the debridement of the entire subacromial 
bursa (bursectomy) and resection of the bony spurs 
and the projecting anterolateral undersurface of the 
acromion, was carried out with a shaver, burr, and/or 
electrocoagulation.14
Postoperative care
The postoperative rehabilitation was identical in the 
ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy groups, consisting of 
one visit to an independent physiotherapist, blind to 
the group assignment, for guidance and instructions 
for home exercises.
Outcome measures
Given that the pathognomonic clinical sign of shoulder 
impingement syndrome is subacromial shoulder pain, 
especially at night and while lifting the arm, our two 
primary outcome measures were shoulder pain at rest 
and shoulder pain on arm activity at 24 months. We used 
a 0-100 visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no 
pain) to 100 (extreme pain) to assess the shoulder pain. 
At the time of our trial’s launch no direct evidence on 
the appropriate minimal clinically important difference 
for VAS in patients with shoulder impingement 
syndrome was available, so we considered 15 points 
to be the minimal clinically important difference. 
We based this estimate on an extensive review of the 
existing literature on minimal clinically important 
differences for the VAS scale in a wide range of different 
musculoskeletal conditions. The appropriateness of 
the chosen minimal clinically important difference has 
subsequently been validated.15
Secondary outcomes included two shoulder function 
assessment instruments, the Constant-Murley score 
and the simple shoulder test, as well as the 15D,16 a 
generic health related quality of life instrument made 
up of 15 dimensions and scored on a scale of 0 (death) 
to 1 (full health). Patients’ global assessment of 
satisfaction with the treatment was assessed on a VAS 
ranging from 0 (completely dissatisfied) to 100 (very 
satisfied), and satisfaction with the treatment outcome 
was assessed using a five item scale (from very satisfied 
to very dissatisfied). We used the responses from the 
latter question to carry out a responder analysis 
(appendix 1).
Questionnaires were administered at baseline and 
three, six, 12, and 24 months after randomisation. 
The follow-up questionnaires also included a separate 
section on adverse events. We defined adverse events as 
untoward medical occurrences that did not necessarily 
have a causal relation with the treatment administered. 
Serious adverse events were those having the potential 
to result in significant disability/incapacity, need 
inpatient hospital care, prolong the hospital care, be 
life threatening, or result in death. At the three month 
follow-up, the surgically treated patients were asked 
which procedure (ASD or diagnostic arthroscopy) they 
thought they had had.
Statistical analysis and sample size calculation
We powered the study to detect a difference of at 
least the minimal clinically important difference 
(15 points15) in the two primary outcomes between 
the ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy groups. For 
the study to have 90% power to show a minimal 
clinically important advantage of ASD over diagnostic 
arthroscopy, under the assumption of a two sided type 
1 error rate of 5%, we planned to recruit 70 patients 
per group.
The trial was primarily designed to ascertain 
whether ASD is superior to diagnostic arthroscopy, at 
24 months after the procedure, with the two primary 
outcomes (the primary confirmatory comparison). We 
also included a pragmatic comparison of the relative 
benefits of ASD versus exercise therapy (the secondary 
exploratory comparison). An independent statistician 
unaware of the group assignments did all the analyses 
according to the previously published statistical 
analysis plan. The statistical analysis plan, outlining 
our statistical methods in more detail, is provided in 
appendix 1.
We quantified the treatment effect on an intention to 
treat (ASD versus diagnostic arthroscopy comparison) 
or full analysis set (ASD versus exercise therapy 
comparison) basis, as the difference between the 
groups in pain scores (VAS), Constant-Murley score, 
simple shoulder test score, and 15D score with the 
associated 95% confidence intervals and P values at 
24 months after the primary randomisation. In the 
intention to treat and full analysis set analyses, the 
participants were included as randomised. We used 
a mixed model repeated measurements analysis of 
variance with patient as a random factor (repeated 
measurements at three, six, 12, and 24 months), 
the baseline value as a covariate, and assuming a 
covariance structure with compound symmetry. As 
the mixed model repeated measurements analysis of 
variance allows for analysis of unbalanced datasets

without imputation, we analysed all available data, 
the full analysis set. The missingness of the outcome 
data at different time points is shown in table S12 
in appendix 2. We fitted the mixed model repeated 
measurements model by using the mixed procedure in 
Stata and used Satterthwaite’s method to calculate the 
degrees of freedom.
We used generalised estimating equation logistic 
regression analysis to analyse categorical variables. 
We compared the frequencies of patients who 
reported satisfaction or subjective improvement and 
the proportions of responders and non-responders, 
those with a change exceeding the minimal clinically 
important improvement in the primary outcomes, and 
reoperations/treatment conversions between the two 
groups at 24 months.
To safeguard against potential multiplicity effects in 
the primary comparison,17 we required a statistically 
significant treatment effect on both of our primary 
outcome variables. All secondary analyses are 
supportive, exploratory, and/or hypothesis generating. 
We did two sensitivity analyses (per protocol and as 
treated) and four subgroup analyses (potential effect 
modifying of the duration and severity of symptoms, 
the acromial anatomy, and the presence/absence 
of bursal resection) with the same principles as the 
intention to treat and full analysis set analyses. We 
considered a P value of 0.05 to indicate statistical 
significance. We used Stata v14.1 for all statistical 
analyses.

We interpreted the results of the trial according to 
a blinded data interpretation scheme.18 In brief,

the analyses, with the groups labelled group A, group 
B, and group C. The Writing Committee then considered 
the interpretation of the results until a consensus 
was reached and agreed in writing on all alternative 
interpretations of the findings. Once a consensus was 
reached, we recorded the minutes of this meeting in a 
document coined statement of interpretation, which 
was signed by all members of the Writing Committee. 
After this common agreement was reached, the data 
manager and the independent statistician broke the 
randomisation code and the correct interpretation was 
chosen. The draft of the manuscript was then finalised. 
Detailed minutes of blinded data interpretation 
meetings are provided in appendix 1.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in designing the study, nor 
were they involved in developing plans for recruitment, 
design, or implementation of the study. No patients 
were asked to advise on interpretation or writing 
up of results. When the results of this randomised 
controlled trial are published, a lay information flyer 
with final results will be sent to the recruiting centres 
for dissemination to the trial participants.
Results
characteristics of patients
Of the 281 eligible patients, we excluded 71 (fig 1). 
A total of 210 patients were included in the first 
randomisation; 71 were assigned to exercise therapy 
and 139 to surgery. Of those allocated to surgery 
(n=139), another 17 were excluded before the second 
randomisation (fig 1), leaving 59 patients to receive 
ASD and 63 to receive diagnostic arthroscopy. Over 
the course of the 24 month follow-up, three patients 
in the exercise therapy group and two patients in 
the diagnostic arthroscopy group withdrew from the 
study, and one patient in the diagnostic arthroscopy 
group died. The study groups were well balanced on 
all baseline characteristics (table 1). The patients who 
withdrew from the study (n=5) were similar to those 
who were randomised with respect to primary outcome 
measures at baseline.
Primary comparison: aSD versus diagnostic 
arthroscopy
Primary outcomes
We saw marked improvement from baseline to 24 
months in both primary outcomes in both the ASD 
and diagnostic arthroscopy groups (mean change for 
ASD 36.0 at rest and 55.4 on activity; for diagnostic 
arthroscopy 31.4 at rest and 47.5 on activity) (fig 2 and 
table 2), but no significant between group differences 
existed at 24 months in either VAS pain at rest (mean 
difference, ASD minus diagnostic arthroscopy, −4.6, 
95% confidence interval −11.3 to 2.1; P=0.18) or VAS 
pain on arm activity (−9.0, −18.1 to 0.2; P=0.054) (fig 
2, table 2, and table S3 in appendix 2). These results 
remained unaltered in the pre-specified sensitivity 
analyses (as treated and per protocol) and subgroup 
analyses (tables S2, S5, and S6 in appendix 2).
Secondary and other outcomes
We found no significant between group differences in 
any of the secondary outcomes (table 2 and table S4 
in appendix 2). Patients in the diagnostic arthroscopy 
group were no more likely than those in the ASD group 
to guess that they had had a placebo procedure (22/53 
(42%) and 2154 (39%), respectively; P=0.85).
Unblinding of treatment allocation and crossovers
Six of 59 patients in the ASD group and nine of 
63 patients in the diagnostic arthroscopy group 
(P=0.49) reported persistent symptoms after surgery 
sufficiently severe to lead to unblinding of the study 
group assignment (at an average of 10 months after 
the index operation) (table S7 in appendix 2). Two 
participants in the ASD group underwent a consequent 
reoperation—one had manipulation under anaesthesia 
and the other first had acromioclavicular resection 
and then later manipulation under anaesthesia. In 
the diagnostic arthroscopy group, eight patients had 
a reoperation (seven ASDs and one ASD coupled with 
subscapularis tendon repair). Details of unblindings, 
treatment conversions, and reoperations are shown in 
table S7 in appendix 2.
Complications and adverse events
One patient in the diagnostic arthroscopy group had 
temporary swelling in the brachial area related to 
a brachial plexus block. Three patients in the ASD 
group and one patient in the diagnostic arthroscopy 
group developed symptoms consistent with a frozen 
shoulder over the course of the 24 month follow-up 
(table 2). No other complications directly related to the 
interventions were registered.
Secondary comparison: aSD versus exercise 
therapy
Primary outcomes
Marked improvement from baseline to 24 months 
was seen in both primary outcomes in both the ASD 
and exercise therapy groups (fig 3, table 3, and table 
S8 in appendix 2). We found statistically significant 
differences in favour of ASD at 24 months in both VAS 
at rest (−7.5, −14.0 to −1.0; P=0.023) and VAS on arm 
activity (−12.0, −20.9 to −3.2; P=0.008), but the mean 
difference between the groups did not exceed the pre-
specified minimal clinically important difference 
of 15. These results remained essentially unaltered 
in the pre-specified sensitivity analyses (table S10 
in appendix 2). We found no significant differences 
between the groups in the proportion of patients 
with pain reduction exceeding the minimal clinically 
important improvement threshold of 15 in VAS pain at 
rest and VAS pain on activity (table S11 in appendix 2). 
The proportion of patients with VAS pain on activity 
below the threshold of 30 at 24 months was lower in 
the exercise therapy group than in the ASD group (table 
S11 in appendix 2). Of note, this ASD versus exercise 
therapy comparison is confounded by lack of blinding 
and the fact that 17/139 (12%) patients were excluded 
from the two surgical groups before the second 
 on 1 June 2019 by guest. Protected by copyright.

randomisation without any comparable exclusions 
from the exercise therapy group. As a result, this ASD 
versus exercise therapy comparison is likely to be 
biased in favour of ASD. Also, the progressive exercise 
therapy regimen carried out in the exercise therapy 
group is different from the overall postoperative care 
carried out for patients in the ASD group.
Secondary and other outcomes
The only statistically significant between group 
difference in the secondary outcomes was in the 
Constant-Murley score in favour of ASD (7.7, 1.6 to 
13.9; P=0.013) (table 3), but the mean difference 
between the groups did not exceed the pre-specified 
threshold of 17 for minimal clinically important 
difference. Furthermore, the group differences in the 
Constant-Murley score were not statistically significant 
in the pre-specified sensitivity analyses (table S10 in 
appendix 2).
Unblinding of treatment allocation and crossovers
Fifteen patients who were initially assigned to exercise 
therapy reported persistent symptoms sufficiently 
severe to require unblinding; 14 of them subsequently 
underwent ASD and one underwent acromioclavicular 
resection. 
Three 
consequent 
reoperations 
were 
performed (table S7 in appendix 2).
Complications and adverse events
Two patients in the exercise therapy group developed 
symptoms consistent with a frozen shoulder, and one 
patient reported aggravation of low back pain over the 
course of exercise therapy regimen (table 3). No other 
adverse events directly related to the exercise therapy 
were registered.
discussion
This multicentre, randomised, placebo controlled 
trial involving patients with shoulder impingement 
syndrome showed that arthroscopic subacromial 
decompression was not superior to diagnostic 
arthroscopy, with regard to outcomes assessed at the 
end of a 24 month follow-up period. Although both 
groups had significant improvement in both primary 
outcomes, the patients assigned to ASD had no 
clinically relevant improvement over those assigned to 
diagnostic arthroscopy.
comparison with other studies
We are aware of only one other randomised, placebo 
surgery controlled trial on the efficacy of ASD in the 
treatment of shoulder impingement syndrome.19 The

Arthroscopy Work?” (CSAW) trial showed that at both

the primary six month follow-up and the secondary 
12 
month 
follow-up, 
arthroscopic 
subacromial 
decompression seemed to offer no extra benefit 
over arthroscopy alone (placebo comparator).20 The 
findings are in full agreement with the short term (six 
and 12 month) findings of our trial (fig 2 and table 
S3 in appendix 2) with respect to efficacy of ASD 
over diagnostic arthroscopy. Our trial further shows 
no clinically relevant benefit of ASD over diagnostic 
arthroscopy at our primary, 24 month, follow-up time 
point.
Strengths and limitations of study
The placebo surgery controlled design represents the 
primary difference between our trial and the CSAW 
trial20 and the rest of the existing literature on this 
topic. Acknowledging that the act of surgery in itself 
produces a profound placebo response,21-23 the actual 
treatment effect is impossible to distinguish from the 
nonspecific (and placebo) effects—such as the patients’ 
or researchers’ expectations of benefit—without a 
placebo comparison group.24 Such bias is particularly 
important in trials with subjective endpoints.25 Given 
that the proportions of patients who guessed whether 
they had undergone a placebo procedure was similar 
in the two surgical groups, we argue that the risk 
of performance bias is low in our trial. Diagnostic 
arthroscopy controlled trials in the knee and shoulder 
with a very similar design to our study have prompted 
assertions that diagnostic arthroscopy cannot be 
considered a true placebo comparator because of the 
alleged therapeutic effects of joint lavage.26-29 The 
existing high quality evidence disputes such assertions, 
as tidal irrigation and arthroscopic lavage have both 
failed to provide a benefit over placebo procedures 
(placebo irrigation or skin incisions, respectively).22 30 
Moreover, no concerns were expressed regarding the 
validity of using diagnostic arthroscopy as a control in 
a previous placebo surgery controlled trial on surgery 
after shoulder dislocation.31 One obvious advantage 
of appropriate blinding became readily apparent in 
our trial. In the previous (unblinded) trials comparing 
ASD with conservative treatment alternatives,13 32-34 
the observed higher frequency of crossovers in the 
conservatively treated patients has been interpreted as 
evidence for the superiority of ASD over conservative

treatment. However, we note that the decision to (re)
operate was made after unblinding of the treatment 
group allocation, whereas the decision to unblind the 
treatment group is made without awareness of the 
treatment given to the patient. We thus consider the 
frequency of “unblindings” a less biased measure of the 
severity of participants’ symptoms than the frequency 
crossovers.35 In our trial, we found no statistically 
significant difference in the frequency of unblindings 
between the ASD and diagnostic arthroscopy groups 
(6/59 in the ASD group versus 9/63 in the diagnostic 
arthroscopy group; P=0.49).
Besides the placebo control, another obvious 
strength of the ASD versus diagnostic arthroscopy 
comparison was the efficacy or mechanistic design.36 
We used highly experienced surgeons and therapists 
and isolated the critical therapeutic element of the 
ASD procedure—the subacromial decompression—as 
the only difference between the two surgical groups 
while carefully maintaining all other care as close 
to identical as possible. In particular, we used very 
stringent eligibility criteria to enrol—according to best 
available evidence—only patients most likely to benefit 
from ASD. Classically, stringent eligibility criteria are 
considered to decrease the external validity of a study. 
Although our patient population was indeed highly 
selected, as showcased by the lengthy recruitment 
period needed despite three high volume centres, 
we think that the use of stringent eligibility criteria 
paradoxically increases the generalisability of our 
findings. When ASD was proven futile under this best 
case scenario, there is no reason to assume that it 
would work better under less optimal circumstances 
or in a more heterogeneous population. We also note 
that our primary findings are robust, as the sensitivity 
and subgroup analyses did not materially change the 
findings of our primary analyses (tables S5 and S6 in 
appendix 2). In essence, the duration or severity of 
symptoms or the acromial anatomy—factors previously 
asserted as potential modifiers of the effect of ASD—
did not have a hypothesised effect on the primary 
outcomes (table S6 in appendix 2). Obviously, all our 
subgroup analyses are at higher risk of bias and should 
be considered only supportive, explanatory, and/or 
hypothesis generating.
Some limitations warrant discussion. The number 
of participants completing the entire two year follow-
up was 59 in both the ASD group and the diagnostic 
arthroscopy group, below the pre-specified target of 68. 
The high number of exclusions among the participants 
allocated to surgery was primarily attributable to 
unexpectedly poor sensitivity of magnetic resonance 
arthrography in detecting rotator cuff tears and 
other pathology needing intervention other than 
ASD. Although our sample size being below the pre-
specified target might prompt assertions that the study 
is underpowered, we note that our point estimates 
exclude clinically significant treatment effects. In 
essence, our findings are not based on absence of 
evidence, as in an underpowered study, but rather on 
evidence of absence of a clinically significant treatment 
benefit. One may also criticise the validity of the chosen 
minimal clinically important difference threshold. At 
the time of designing the trial, no evidence existed on 
the appropriate minimal clinically important difference 
for patients with shoulder impingement syndrome, so 
instead of being based on empirical data our estimate 
for the minimal clinically important difference (15 
VAS points) was based on extensive review of the 
literature in a wide range of different musculoskeletal 
conditions. Reassuringly, some years after the launch 
of our trial, a study exploring the minimal clinically 
important difference for the pain VAS in rotator cuff
 
disease reported a point estimate of 14 VAS points.15

bursa) provides similar outcomes to subacromial 
decompression 
(bursectomy 
accompanied 
by 
resection of acromial bone) in patients with shoulder 
impingement syndrome.37-39 Acknowledging this, 
while also appreciating that a rotator cuff tendon tear 
is considered a different clinical entity from shoulder 
impingement and a potentially strong prognostic factor 
for poor outcome, we were faced with a methodological 
dilemma between the elimination of the presence of 
a clinically relevant rotator cuff tear versus possible 
confounding caused by a need to carry minimal 
resection of the subacromial bursal tissue to properly 
visualise rotator cuff tendon insertion. We chose to 
prioritise the rotator cuff tears; accordingly, bursa 
was either bluntly stretched with trochar or resected 
if adequate visualisation of the rotator cuff insertion 
could not be achieved otherwise. Bursal resection was 
carried out in 18 (30%) of the 63 participants in the 
diagnostic arthroscopy group; in all but three cases, 
the resection was minimal. To assess the possible effect 
of this bursal tissue resection on our findings, we did a 
pre-specified post hoc analysis (table S2 in appendix 
2). Although underpowered, the analysis did not show 
any statistically significant differences in the primary 
outcomes between patients who had resection carried 
out and those who did not. If anything, the observed 
marginal differences favoured no resection.
Furthermore, on the decision to carry out bursal 
resection, despite our thorough preoperative screening 
that included both careful clinical examination and 
magnetic resonance imaging with contrast, roughly 
4% (6/134) of patients having shoulder arthroscopy 
had to be excluded owing to a rotator cuff tear found 
at arthroscopic examination. Conventional wisdom 
dictates that the preferred treatment for rotator cuff
 
tears is to repair partial thickness tears that involve 
more than 50% of the tendon thickness (grade III), 
whereas those that involve less than 50% of the 
tendon thickness (grades I and II) can be treated 
with debridement, with or without accompanying 
subacromial decompression.40 In this trial, we chose 
to adhere to this treatment strategy, although its 
veracity—the need to repair grade III/full thickness 
rotator cuff tears of degenerative origin—can be 
questioned according to the most recent high quality 
evidence.41 Finally, a frozen shoulder is considered 
a potential complication of the treatment of patients 
with shoulder impingement syndrome, particularly of 
shoulder arthroscopy.42 However, at the early stages 
of the disease, the clinical presentation of a slowly 
developing frozen shoulder can mimic subacromial 
impingement, so a legitimate concern exists that some 
of the participants we labelled as having developed a 
frozen shoulder as a complication of treatment might 
actually initially have been misdiagnosed as having 
shoulder impingement syndrome while actually 
having a frozen shoulder in the first place. In the end, 
the number of patients labelled having developed a 
frozen shoulder was small in all groups (two, three, 
and one in the exercise therapy, ASD, and diagnostic 
arthroscopy groups, respectively).
In addition to our primary sham surgery controlled 
efficacy comparison between ASD and diagnostic 
arthroscopy, our study also included a pragmatic, 
exploratory secondary comparison between surgical 
and non-operative care (ASD versus exercise therapy). 
In apparent contrast to four previous, similar 
randomised trials that found no benefit of ASD over 
various exercise therapy regimens,13 32-34 we observed 
a statistically significant benefit of ASD over exercise 
therapy in both our primary outcomes. Although 
the benefit did not exceed the pre-specified minimal 
clinically important difference (15 point change in 
VAS) in either of the two primary outcomes (table 
3), a potential beneficial effect of ASD over exercise 
therapy cannot be completely ruled out, as the 
confidence intervals for the mean difference in pain 
VAS on arm activity include the minimal clinically 
important difference. In interpreting the findings for 
ASD versus exercise therapy, one needs to appreciate 
several concerns related to this comparison. Firstly, 
this is not a blinded comparison as the participants 
are naturally aware of the treatments given and thus 
the results are inevitably confounded by potentially 
different placebo effects related to the surgical and 
nonoperative care. Secondly, a clear prognostic 
imbalance exists between the two interventions 
owing to the exclusions carried out before the second 
randomisation in the group primarily allocated to 
surgery: 17 (12%) of the 139 participants allocated 
to the two surgical groups were excluded without 
any comparable exclusions from the exercise 
therapy group. Thus, the ASD versus exercise 
therapy comparison is likely to be biased in favour 
of ASD owing to the systematic removal of patients 
with likely poorer prognosis. Finally, the ASD and 
exercise therapy groups cannot be considered fully 
comparable owing to differences in the treatment 
given. The progressive exercise therapy regimen 
carried out in the exercise therapy group is different 
from the postoperative rehabilitation carried out 
by patients in the ASD group, as surgically treated 
patients need time to recover from the initial surgical 
trauma while also being subject to some degree of 
postoperative immobilisation, extended sick leave, 
and modifications in pain medication and activities. 
In summary, the results of our secondary comparison 
(ASD versus exercise therapy) should be interpreted 
with caution, as we do not know whether exercise 
therapy is poorer because of the lack of comparability 
of the groups, because exercise therapy is truly a less 
effective treatment, or a mixture of both.
conclusions and policy implications
The results of this randomised, placebo surgery 
controlled trial show that arthroscopic subacromial 
decompression provides no clinically relevant benefit 
over diagnostic arthroscopy in patients with shoulder 
impingement syndrome. The findings do not support 
the current practice of performing subacromial 
decompression in patients with shoulder impingement 
syndrome.
