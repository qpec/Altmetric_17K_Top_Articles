guidelines in Korean newspapers

Abstract
Background: With the dishonor of being the highest suicide rated country in Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, South Korea should take more initiatives in suicide prevention. Although the role of the media and
its relation to actual suicide attempts has been tested and supported by many studies, the suicide reporting guidelines
are not well followed. The purpose of this study is to examine how well Korean newspapers adhere to existing
guidelines and to suggest limitation and improvements for the current guidelines.
Methods: Five mainstream newspapers in South Korea, namely, Kyunghyang Shinmun, Hankyoreh, Chosun Ilbo, JoongAng
Daily, and Dong-A Ilbo, were chosen for the analysis. Using the Naver news search engine, articles dated from January 1,
2014, to December 31, 2017, were selected with the keyword “suicide” and advanced option “printed newspaper.”
However, articles, columns, opinions, and reviews that utilized the word “suicide” in a general context were excluded
from the final analysis. Finally, the number of cases was narrowed down to 368. Each article was analyzed using the
guideline framework consisting of 13 items: sensational coverage, overstatement, direct wording, method used, details
about site/location, photographs, suicide note, generalization, speculation, romanticization, interviews with the bereaved,
help-seeking information, and public education.
Results: More than 60% of the articles included direct wording (63.9%), mentioned the method used (68.2%), and
provided details about the site or location (74.5%). Nearly half of the articles revealed the contents of the suicide note
(44.6%). Less than 3% of the suicide reports had information about hotline logo or phone numbers (1.4%) and facts
regarding suicide and suicide prevention (2.2%).
Conclusions: Our study revealed that the guidelines were ineffective in their monitoring role and that most of the
newspapers were incompliant with many significant guideline items in South Korea. Our findings not only explore the
limitations of the current guidelines but also provide an important rationale as to why there should be stronger suicide
monitoring regulation or an agency with sufficient authority to prevent suicide in a nation-wide scale.

Background
According to World Health Organization (WHO) sui-
cide data [1], nearly 800,000 people die of suicide every
year. Suicide not only accounts for 1.4% of all deaths
worldwide but is also the second leading cause of death
among 15–29-year-olds globally. Of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development countries,
South Korea has by far the highest suicide rate. While
South Korea’s suicide rate reached 26.5% per 100,000
people in 2015, the country with the second highest
suicide rate, Hungary, had a rate of 19.4% in the same
year [2, 3]. Suicide is especially high among the elderly
population and it is the first cause of death among 10–
30-year-olds in South Korea [4].
Based on several theoretical studies, it has been found
that the frequency with which a person is exposed to
suicide coverage can have a significant impact on his/her
making an actual suicide attempt [5–9]. For example, in
social learning theory, the greater the similarity between
the model and the learner, the more likely it is that the
learner will imitate the model’s behavior; this is labeled
as “copycat suicide” [5]. Modeling theory suggests that a
particular pattern of behavior described in the media

 can become a model for the audience [6]. Thom et al.
[9] suggest that when the media covers suicide stories
with detailed methods, visual items, glamorization, em-
phasis on celebrities, or sensationalism, the number of
imitation suicides surges and the audience starts to per-
ceive suicide as a reasonable solution for life challenges.
Suicide reported cases on media is unknowingly pervad-
ing into our daily lives, thoughts, and action. According to
the Korea Association for Suicide Prevention, following
the two-month period after the suicide of a Korean actress
in 2008, the number of people committing suicide in-
creased by 41.4% (2007 = 1807/2008 = 3081) because of
the Werther effect [10]. Werther effect refers to an in-
crease in the number of suicides in a population triggered
by media reporting on a suicide case [11]. Similarly, the
number of railway suicidal acts increased by 18.8% com-
pared to the 2-year period before the railway suicide of a
famous German goalkeeper [11].
Since people attempt to commit suicide or feel sym-
pathy toward the person involved in the suicidal act
[12–14], media should feel more responsible to abide by
suicide reporting guidelines than any others. Gould et al.
[8] proposed that the amount, duration, and prominence
of media coverage are proportionate to an increase in
suicide rates. Newspapers were more influential medium
causing copycat suicides than television by 82% [15].
This is because, unlike television, which sends out visu-
alized news coverage in a short time, newspapers can
convey more details to the public without a time limit
[15]. Newspaper articles can be easily accessed, saved,
and reread through various media as well thus it enables
the readers to regurgitate the materials [16]. Addition-
ally, unlike printed newspapers, online articles can be
reproduced continuously and without limit, exposing the
readers more frequently to suicide contents [17].
Given the amount of research conducted in this field,
suicide reporting guidelines should have a considerable
impact on preventing suicide. Acknowledging such im-
portance, a number of international and nationwide or-
ganizations, such as the WHO, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC), Samaritans, Mindset,
and Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare have estab-
lished their own suicide reporting guidelines [18–22].
The WHO launched its first guidelines for suicide pre-
vention in 1999 and the current guidelines are the sec-
ond set to address specific social and professional
groups for preventing suicide [21]. The CDC suicide
guidelines are based on more than 50 international stud-
ies on suicide contagion and were initially developed by
the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention and
several leading experts in suicide prevention, along with
several public and media organizations [18]. Samaritans
produced the UK media guidelines following extensive
consultation with journalists and editors throughout the
industry [19]. Its guideline provides practical recommen-
dations for reporting on suicide across all types of media
to support high-quality journalism and help reporters
avoid common pitfalls [19]. Mindset’s guidelines are
commonly used in Canada; however, its work is the re-
sult of collaboration between the American Association
of Suicidology and the Canadian Association for Suicide
Prevention [20]. Mindset’s guideline consists of general
statements to aid in the responsible presentation of in-
formation about suicide [20].
In Korea, the first suicide reporting guidelines were an-
nounced by the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare in
2004, and they were updated on September 9, 2013, with
three additional principles and one revised [22]. Principles
such as respecting the bereaved family, not mentioning
the details of the suicide, not romanticizing the act, and
avoiding sensationalized expression remained the same in
the updated version. However, more specific and prevent-
ive measures, such as principles 2 (usage of direct word-
ing), 7 (information regarding consequences), 8 (conveying
accurate information about suicide prevention), and 9
(paying special attention to online reports) have been
added in the new guidelines (Table 1).
The levels of concordance and discordance of media
reports with suicide guidelines can provide important
implications for further research and the improvement
of the current guidelines. Creed and Whitley [23] found
that 55% of the Canadian newspapers that reported on
the suicide of a famous figure had adhered to Mindset’s
guidelines by up to 80%. In the study of Ramadas and
Kuttichira [24], they referred to the WHO guidelines
and the suggestions of professionals in the related field
to create their analytical framework. They observed an
increase in the percentage of guideline concordance fol-
lowing the development of suicide reporting guidelines
in India. Harshe et al. utilized the guidelines formulated
by the Indian Psychiatric Society [25]. Having to see the
increasing numbers of detailed news stories after a
celebrity suicide, they expressed concern over the pos-
sible spurts of copycat suicide in India. In the United

 Kingdom, the online media was poorly compliant with
Samaritans’ guidelines in reporting suicide cases [26]. As
a result, researchers of this study saw the need to imple-
ment responsible and clear guidelines that could im-
prove the poor quality of online media reporting and to
train journalists appropriately.
However, unlike other countries, South Korea is sig-
nificantly lacking in the study of suicide reporting guide-
lines. Kim [27] analyzed the difference in the number of
suicide reports before and after the implementation of
“Suicide Reporting Guideline 1.0” in 2004. Only two
items were statistically significant, making it hard to
conclude that the intervention was effective. Yeo and
Lee [28] highlighted problems and suggested solutions
for the existing suicide reporting guidelines; however,
their study only focused on the coverage of specific ce-
lebrity suicides in three Korean broadcasting channels.
In addition, Yu [29] carried out an exploratory study for
establishing more realistic media guidelines for the
reporting of suicides. Rather than analyzing newspaper
articles, the study carried out a survey asking what fac-
tors should be included in the guidelines.
While the importance of developing suicide guidelines
continuously rises, only a few studies have explored their
fidelity. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investi-
gate how well Korean newspapers follow suicide report-
ing guidelines and to explore the potential problems and
limitations regarding the current guidelines.
Methods
Sample
Five mainstream newspapers in South Korea, namely,
Kyunghyang Shinmun, Hankyoreh, Chosun Ilbo, Joon-
gAng Daily, and Dong-A Ilbo, were chosen since they are
commonly known and read among the Korean public.
Through Naver news search engine, articles dated from
January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2017, were selected
with the keyword “suicide” and the advanced option of
“printed newspaper.” It yielded a total of 6888 cases.
However, articles, columns, opinions, and reviews that
utilized the word “suicide” in a general context were ex-
cluded from the final analysis. In the end, the number of
cases was narrowed down to 368 (Fig. 1).
Analysis
A combination of several guidelines including those pro-
posed by the WHO, CDC, Samaritans, and Mindset was
used to create a framework for the analysis in this study
[18–21]. Each article was coded for either presence/yes
(1) or absence/no (0) of the guideline items shown in
Table 2. Prior to the coding procedure, two authors re-
ceived practical training from experts in systematic reviews
and went through several practice sessions in order to col-
lect the accurate data. Afterward, two authors individually
examined the articles and a reviewer performed the final
quality check. However, since two coders had to rely on
their subjective judgment to evaluate each source, there
were chances of errors. To reduce such errors, the authors
decided to conduct interobserver agreement. Twenty ran-
domly selected articles were first given to the two coders,
and later, a cross-tabulation analysis was carried out to
create a merged dataset. However, in cases where the two
coders differed in their perspectives, a third party was in-
volved to resolve the differences between them. The Kappa
coefficient was 0.962, which implies an “almost perfect”
strength of agreement [30].
Results
From 368 cases, the number of suicide reports was the
highest in 2014 (38.9%), but overall, the number decreased
from 143 cases in 2014 to 65 cases in 2017. In general,
most of the suicide coverage from the five mainstream Ko-
rean newspapers adhered well to guidelines 1 (sensational
coverage), 2 (overstatement), 6 (use of visual contents), 8
(generalization), 9 (speculation), 10 (romanticization), and
11 (interview). However, four items appeared to be incom-
pliant with the guidelines and frequently appeared in re-
ports of suicide. Direct wording was present in 63.9% of
the total cases. Mentioning the method used and provid-
ing details about the site and location were high, at 68.2
and 74.5%, respectively. As many as 44.6% of the articles
included the contents of the suicide note. On the recom-
mended side, both guidelines 12 (inclusion of accurate in-
formation) and 13 (educating the public) were absent
from nearly all suicide reports, and respectively only 1.4
and 2.2% of the reports included such information.
Sensational coverage/headline
It is necessary for headline writers to think carefully
about the content and its potential impact. The word
“suicide” should not be used in the headline, and there
should not be references to the method and site. In
addition, language that sensationalizes suicide should be
avoided [18, 20]. In this study, 23.9% (88 cases) of sui-
cide reports intentionally capitalized on or emphasized
the suicidal frequency, the sensational aspect of the sui-
cide notes, or the motives for suicide in their headlines.
Overstatement/over-identification/over-simplification
Over-simplification can be misleading and is unlikely to
accurately reflect the complexity of suicide [21]. It is im-
portant not to minimalize the complex realities of suicide
and the devastating impact on the people left behind [19].
In this study, 23.1% of the cases were shown to have com-
mitted the error of over-simplification. For example, some
articles explained a K-pop star’s suicide in the context of
the harsh idol-making system in South Korea, disregard-
ing any other personal or social factors [31]. Similarly,
Chun et al. BMC Public Health  (2018) 18:1115 
Page 3 of 9
 there were articles that overstated the reason for the high
suicide rate among Korean people in their 20s as being
solely owing to the dismal unemployment condition [32].
Direct wording
The word “suicide” should be avoided in the actual con-
tent of the article [18, 19]. Rather than using the word
“suicide,” employing an alternative term, such as “death,”
“passed away,” or “deceased,” is recommended. However,
more than half of the reports (63.9%) directly used the
word “suicide,” showing that this particular guideline is
not well followed.
Mention of the method used
An overly descriptive portrayal of the suicide may com-
pel a vulnerable person to copy the act [21]. Even
though this factor holds great risk to potential attemp-
ters, 68.2% of media suicide reports explained suicide
methods in too much detail. For example, when the
Songpa family suicide tragedy1 occurred in 2014, most
Fig. 1 Sampling Procedure

Page 4 of 9
 readers were aware of the suicide method (e.g., burning
charcoal).
Details about the site/location
Certain locations are frequently chosen for attempting
suicide [19]. The media should take particular care not
to promote these suicide sites. However, contrary to the
guidelines, 74.5% of the reports provided details about
the site/location. This is especially dangerous in that it
can increase the chances of such places becoming com-
mon sites for suicide. For example, high balconies and
large bridges have become common places for people to
commit suicide.
Use of photographs, video, and social media links related
to the act
Photographs, video footage, or social media links de-
scribing the scene of a suicide should not be used. In
addition, great caution is required in using pictures of
the deceased [18]. These images should not be promin-
ently placed or glamorize the individual or act [19]. Ap-
proximately 12.5% of the printed newspapers utilized
visual contents to attract more readers and some posted
photographs of the actual sites where poisoning or
self-burning occurred.
Contents of a suicide note
Final text messages, social media posts, emails, and sui-
cide notes from the deceased individual should not be
published [21]. According to our results, 44.6% of the ar-
ticles included contents of the suicide note. Some uti-
lized the sensationalized part of the suicide note, such as
“I should have killed more people before I committed
suicide...” or “I couldn’t speak a single word...” [33, 34]
so that they could attract more readers.
Generalizing suicide as a constructive solution to the
problem or as a coping mechanism
Language that misinforms the public about suicide, nor-
malizes suicide or provides simple explanations for a sui-
cide should be avoided [19]. This type of language may
serve to desensitize the public to the gravity of suicide
or even imply that death is a desirable outcome [21].
While a very high percentage of suicide reports (91.3%)
avoided the generalization error, some authors general-
ized the suicide of a Lotte Group2 vice president as an
act to save the company [35].
Speculating or jumping to conclusions
Speculation about a death or the circumstances sur-
rounding a death can easily be misreported or wrongly
repeated as fact [19]. Hence, speculation about suicide,
even if provided by a close family member, should be
avoided. In the analysis, 36.7% of the articles were found
to contain speculative statements. Some writers specu-
lated on the reason for a suicide based solely on inter-
views with neighbors or acquaintances or even without
any specific evidence.
Romanticizing the act
Over-emphasizing community expressions of grief, such
as “mourning,” may suggest that people are honoring
the suicidal behavior rather than mourning the death
[20]. Reporting suicide as a tragic waste and an avoidable
loss is more beneficial in preventing further deaths [21].
Approximately 3.8% of the articles romanticized the act.
In particular, when the vice principal of Danwon High
School3 committed suicide out of guilt, some romanti-
cized this as a result of his having felt accountable. Simi-
larly, there were many articles expressing an extreme
degree of mourning, respect, and sorrow when Robin
Williams passed away [36].
Interviews with the bereaved
Interviews may cause further pain to those who have
survived the suicide attempt or to their family members
[21]. Journalists, who are obsessed with publicizing a
dramatic story, often take away family’s privacy and time
[20]. When interviews take place, reporters should verify
any information regarding the suicide since the words of
the bereaved might be affected by their extreme emo-
tions [21]. According to our study, there were 54 (14.7%)
cases that mentioned interviews with the bereaved fam-
ily. In many circumstances, these were interviews with
the wife, husband, or parents of the suicide victim.
Providing accurate information about where to seek help
including hotline or local crisis phone numbers
Since suicide coverage may impel readers to take similar
action, the articles should always end with instructions

 on how to seek help [20]. The information must be ac-
curate, accessible, and concise for it to be helpful [21].
Surprisingly, there were only five newspaper articles
(1.4%) that provided accurate information on how to
seek help. In other words, most of the articles were only
focused on delivering information on the suicidal act
and left out preventative information.
Educating the public about the facts of suicide and
suicide prevention
Since there are many misconceptions about suicide,
which the public tends to accept it as facts, it is neces-
sary to provide factual information about suicide [20]. In
addition to carefully researching the facts about suicide,
it is always helpful to report on suicide prevention [21].
Only eight articles (2.2%) included factual information
about suicide and its possible consequences. This again
shows how ignorant and passive South Korean newspa-
pers have been in preventing suicide (Tables 3 and 4).
Discussion
This study explored how effective five Korean newspapers
are at following the country’s suicide reporting guidelines.
Owing to the exposure of high risk in suicide, strengthening
the suicide reporting guidelines is essential in South Korea.
Our findings on using direct wording (63.9%), providing de-
tailed information (74.5%), and reporting the contents of
the suicide note (44.6%) were very similar to those of Kim’s
[27] study, where percentage of these items were 64, 75 and
45%, respectively. The overall percentage of articles specu-
lating or jumping to conclusions (36.7%) was similar to the
results of Creed and Whitley (34.8%) [23] and Utterson et
al.’s (30.1%) [26] studies. Similarly, the results for providing
hotline information (1.4%) and educating the public (2.2%)
aligned with the studies by Ramadas and Kuttichira [24]
and Harshe et al. [25], who found nearly zero cases for
these guideline items. Contrary to other international stud-
ies that showed less than 30% of discordance in providing
extensive details about the method, site/location, and sui-
cide note, our findings showed much higher percentages of
discordance with these items—68.2, 74.5 and 44.6%, re-
spectively—in South Korea [16, 25, 26, 37].
More than half of the articles included direct wording
(63.9%), made mention of the location (74.5%), and
made mention of the method used (68.2%). This is espe-
cially problematic in that it provides information for
potential attempters to execute the act [38]. The public
is already familiar with popular suicide methods and lo-
cations such as burning charcoal in closed rooms or
jumping off a bridge over the Han River in Seoul, Korea
[27]. Moreover, special attention should be paid to the
adolescent population. According to Phillips and Car-
stensen [39], the impact of suicide stories on subse-
quently completed suicides have been reported to be the
greatest among teenagers. The chances of adolescents
committing
copycat
suicides
are
high,
as
their
self-identities are not yet fully developed; this allows
them to be easily influenced by celebrities [40]. Add-
itionally, the youth are likely to be influenced by news-
paper stories that are more prominent (e.g., front-page
placement or inclusion of a picture), more explicit (e.g.,
with headlines containing the word “suicide” or specify-
ing the method used), or more detailed (e.g., including
the name of the deceased, the details of the method, or a
suicide note) [41].
Another critical issue lies on having so few articles with
help-seeking information or factual information about sui-
cide. The need to provide appropriate suicide information
becomes a significant task. Additionally, when leaving out
such information, suicide becomes the problem of one in-
dividual, rather than a social or general public health
problem of which we must all be aware [38].
Moreover, the results of this study provide important
insights for examining the weaknesses in the existing
Korean suicide reporting guidelines. Even though visual

 contents and suicide notes are proven to be influential
factors for the actual suicide attempt [18, 21, 41], refer-
ences to those items were left out of Suicide Reporting
Guideline 2.0. In the study by Ramadas and Kuttichira
[24], 37% of cases (N = 3270) included photographs of
the deceased, the method, and the scene. Harshe et al.
[25] separated the visual contents section into three spe-
cific guideline items. Out of 708 cases, 20.29% had “a
photograph of the victim,” 11.98% had “a photograph of
the location” and 14.42% had “a graphical illustration to
depict the suicide/location,” meaning that in total,
46.69% included some type of visual contents within the
article. In an analysis of Chinese newspapers, 57.5% of
articles had photos and 4.7% had graphics; in other
words, 62.2% had visual content items [42]. Having to
confirm the prevalence and importance of this particular
guideline item, those covering visual contents or suicide
notes should be included in the updated version of the
Korean suicide reporting guidelines. However, most im-
portantly, media as a primary stakeholder should engage
more proactively with these guideline items.
Currently, there are three organizations that monitor
suicide coverage in the media: the Korea Suicide Preven-
tion Center, the Korea Communications Standards Com-
mission, and the Journalists Association of Korea [43,
44]. The Korea Suicide Prevention Center [44] has estab-
lished the Suicide Prevention Committee with various
stakeholders to broaden the monitoring area, educate
the public, publish the monitoring guide, and raise pub-
lic awareness on the issue of suicide prevention. Despite
the importance of this role, a lack of staff and budget
limit the organization’s scope. According to the Korea
Communications Standards Commission [43], suicide
coverage with too much detail, romanticization or justi-
fication, and speculation is prohibited in broadcasting.
However, there were too many instances whereby this
clause was violated thus Korea Communications Stan-
dards Commission has announced a desire to strengthen
the monitoring regulations [43]. However, these agencies
generally lack the structure and power to effectively
manage suicide prevention on a nationwide scale. Con-
sidering the gravity of this issue, the Korean government
should reinforce the monitoring system and implement
a stricter editorial policy to effectively counteract against
the reckless suicide coverages released on media.
For the establishment of an efficient monitoring sys-
tem, we may refer to the National Strategy for Suicide
Prevention proposed by the Government of the United
Kingdom. The Government of the United Kingdom
made a collective effort in suicide prevention by setting
up several goals and forming an alliance system that are
“supporting the media in delivering sensitive approaches
to suicide and suicidal behavior,” “supporting research,
data
collection,
and
monitoring,”
and
creating
“the
National Suicide Prevention Alliance” [45]. Under the
current administration, Korea has recently announced a
5-year
“National
Suicide
Prevention
Action
Plan
(2018-22)” aiming to reduce the high suicide rate in the
country. According to the Korean Ministry of Health and
Welfare [46], the action plan has four main pillars: 1) pro-
viding a basis for a suicide prevention policy, 2) conducting
a high-risk suicide population assessment, 3) establishing
active intervention management for the high-risk popula-
tion, and 4) providing follow-up service and support for
suicide attempters. However, creating stronger regulations
for suicide reporting guidelines and monitoring suicide
coverage in the media has not been included in this plan.
The results of our study may provide a basis and be a help-
ful resource for the establishment of stronger regulations
for suicide reporting guidelines as well as a structured na-
tional surveillance system on suicide coverage in the
media.
Although this study did not cover online suicide reporting,
the number of online articles outweighs the number of
printed articles; therefore, the problem with suicide coverage
is expected to be greater when online articles are taken into
account. This is because online journalists who compete
with one another for more clicks and views tend to use sen-
sational headlines and content to attract readers [47].
Reporting about suicide is especially problematic in that
many focus on highlighting the issue as something shocking
and gossip-worthy; nothing more [17, 47]. As such, an on-
line regulation policy and penalty system (when too many
details or overly sensational information are given) should
also be considered as part of a suicide prevention policy.
Our study provides an important rationale as to why
there should be stronger regulations for suicide reporting
guidelines. However, it has some limitations. First, our sam-
ple was limited to “printed” articles that were available on-
line. We could have missed articles that were not yet
uploaded or available online. Second, choosing only five
mainstream Korean newspapers for the analysis might have
influenced the overall results of the study. Despite these
limitations, this was the first study to be conducted after the
revision of the Korean guidelines in 2013; thus, our findings
will be a useful source for further studies of this kind.
Conclusions
This study is notable in that South Korea currently lacks
studies on suicide reporting guidelines. From our study, it
became clear that the current guidelines are ineffective.
To reduce suicide rates and attempts and to yield more
positive outcomes for the future, our study strongly sug-
gests avoiding the word “suicide” and detailed descrip-
tions, but rather providing factual yet helpful information
to those who are considering suicide. We expect our find-
ings to be utilized in many suicide-related studies and to
contribute to the establishment of more effective and

 concrete suicide reporting guidelines as well as monitor-
ing systems.
Endnotes
1The Songpa family suicide tragedy: A family consist-
ing of two daughters and their mother committed sui-
cide on February 26, 2014. Even though they were
experiencing hardship (chronic illness, economic diffi-
culty), there was no proper social safety net to help them
recover. This event became the trigger point to reach
out to vulnerable groups located within the blind spot of
the Korean social welfare system.
2According to the Korea Fair Trade Commission re-
port in 2017, the Lotte Group is the fifth largest corpor-
ate in South Korea in terms of its total assets.
3Danwon High School: The school involved in the
Sewol Ferry disaster. The Sewol Ferry sank off Jindo is-
land, South Korea, on 16 April 2014, killing 304 people,
almost all of them Danwon high school students.
