Abstract
Background: There is some evidence to suggest that dog ownership may improve physical activity (PA) among
older adults, but to date, studies examining this, have either depended on self-report or incomplete datasets due to
the type of activity monitor used to record physical activity. Additionally, the effect of dog ownership on sedentary
behaviour (SB) has not been explored. The aim of the current study was to address these issues by using activPAL
monitors to evaluate the influence of dog ownership on health enhancing PA and SB in a longitudinal study of
independently-mobile, community-dwelling older adults.
Methods: Study participants (43 pairs of dog owners and non-dog owners, matched on a range of demographic
variables) wore an activPAL monitor continuously for three, one-week data collection periods over the course of
a year. Participants also reported information about their own and their dog demographics, caring responsibilities,
and completed a diary of wake times. Diary data was used to isolate waking times, and outcome measures of time spent
walking, time spent walking at a moderate cadence (>100 steps/min), time spent standing, time spent sitting, number of
sitting events (continuous periods of sitting), and the number of and of time spent sitting in prolonged events (>30 min).
For each measure, a linear mixed effects model with dog ownership as a fixed effect, and a random effects structure of
measurement point nested in participant nested in pair was used to assess the effect of dog ownership.
Results: Owning a dog indicated a large, potentially health improving, average effect of 22 min additional time spent
walking, 95%CI (12, 34), and 2760 additional steps per day, 95%CI (1667, 3991), with this additional walking
undertaken at a moderate intensity cadence. Dog owners had significantly fewer sitting events. However, there
were no significant differences between the groups for either the total time spent sitting, or the number or
duration of prolonged sedentary events.
Conclusions: The scale of the influence of dog ownership on PA found in this study, indicates that future
research regarding PA in older adults should assess and report dog ownership and/or dog walking status.

 Background
Physical activity (PA) is a well-recognised indicator and
determinant of health [1] and more recently, sedentary
behaviour (SB, sitting or lying with low energy expend-
iture whilst awake; [2]) has been identified as an inde-
pendent risk factor for poor health [3]. Nonetheless, it
is clear that whilst overall PA level decreases with age
[4], older adults (>65 years) are also normally the most
sedentary section of the population [5]. For adults,
including older adults, national PA guidelines recom-
mend 150 min per week of moderate to vigorous phys-
ical activity (MVPA; PA which raises the heart rate) [6].
Although a reduction in time spent in prolonged sitting
is also recommended, there is no consensus about
optimal sitting times. Maintaining appropriate levels of
PA, or working towards this target at a later stage in
life, has been shown to have significant health benefits
for people with and without disease, and forms the
focus for interventions targeting older adults. Higher
levels of PA, including walking, are associated with
improved health [7], reduced mortality, independent
living, maintaining effective function and improved
quality of life [8].
Dog ownership, and in particular dog walking as a
feature of ownership, has been shown to be related to
overall PA levels in a range of age groups. A meta-
analysis of 29 studies conducted over 20 years examin-
ing the activities of Dog Owners (DO) and Non-Dog
Owners (NDO) for a wide range of participants, includ-
ing older adults, concluded that DOs walked more and
were more physically active than NDOs [9], mostly
from self-report PA measures. For example, post-
menopausal female DOs were more likely to self-report
150 min per week exercise and less likely to be seden-
tary [10]. Older adult DOs (n = 330) engaged in more
self-reported walking, not specifically intended as exer-
cise (68 min/week), than non-pet owners (32 min/
week) or non-dog pet owners (32 min/week) [11], but
there was no significant difference between the groups
in time spent walking for exercise (75, 62 and 52 min/
week, respectively). The use of self-report means the
robustness of these apparent effects in older adults can
be questioned due to issues such as recall bias and
social desirability bias. This can be a particular problem
for studies investigating the effect of dog walking, as
walking the dog may be a regular, planned activity that
is easier to recall than other incidental PA, and also
seen as something that owners should do, for example
as a moral duty or to ensure the welfare of the animal.
Objective measures of PA and SB provide opportunities
to gain insight into both the intensity and pattern of PA
and SB, allowing closer scrutiny of the potential rela-
tionship between dog ownership and health. Adult DOs
who walked their dogs [12] had significantly longer
time in MVPA (ActiGraph (ActiGraph Corp, Pensacola,
FL, USA), 35 ± 24 min/day) and were more likely to
meet PA recommendations (53%) than either NDOs
(33 ± 24 min/day; 46%) or DOs who did not walk their
dogs (27 ± 21 min/day; 33%). Older adults who walked
their dog took approximately 1700 more steps (Acti-
Graph) than those who did not walk a dog [13].
A variety of monitors exist for objective measurement
of physical activity and sedentary behaviour, with differ-
ent strengths and weaknesses. The Actigraph monitor is
worn at the hip and uses a threshold of low movement
to identify SB, meaning that some activities undertaken
while standing, such as washing the dishes, can be mis-
classified as sedentary tasks [14]. By contrast, the activ-
PAL (PAL Technologies Ltd., Glasgow, UK) is worn on
the front of the thigh and uses the static component of
gravity to distinguish sitting and lying postures from
standing, and is generally held as the gold standard for
measuring SB [15]. The step count function of the Acti-
graph can underestimate total steps by as much as 40%
at normal walking speeds (0.89 m/s [16]), whereas step
count measured by the activPAL in older adults has been
reported
to
be
>99%
accurate
at
similar
speeds
(≥0.67 m/s [17]). The activPAL is worn continuously, in-
cluding overnight and during bathing (since it can be
waterproofed), so that all PA and SB is measured, unlike
the Actigraph, which is typically removed overnight and
possibly at other times, increasing the likelihood that ac-
tivity is missed.
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to use the
activPAL monitor within a longitudinal design, in order
to evaluate the association of dog ownership with both
PA
and
SB
in
independently-mobile,
community-
dwelling older adults. Due to the potential for complex
relationships between physical behaviour, dog ownership
status and health, we chose to explore a range of health
related physical activity and sedentary behaviour out-
come measures. We hypothesised that owning a dog
would be associated with increased physical activity (lon-
ger time spent walking, more steps taken) and reduced
sedentary behaviour (less time spent sitting, less pro-
longed sitting, more sit-to-stand transitions).
Methods
Design
To assess the association of dog ownership on PA and
SB of older adults, a case-controlled design was used
where
study
participants
(DOs
and
NDOs)
were
matched on a range of demographic variables. Using
activPAL monitors, data was continuously sampled for
three one-week data collection periods over the course
of a year. This design was employed to reduce the risk
of bias from drop-outs (e.g. if the third data collection
period was always winter) and thus aimed to create a
Dall et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:496 
Page 2 of 9
 data set that was representative of a broad range of wea-
ther conditions.
Ethical Approval
Full ethical approval was granted from the School of Life
Sciences delegated authority of the University of Lincoln
ethical approval committee, with further review and
approval given by the WALTHAM animal welfare and
ethical review board. All participants provided written,
informed consent, and could withdraw from the study at
any time without providing a reason.
Sample size calculation
A sample size analysis indicated that 27 older adults per
group would be sufficient to have 80% power to detect a
difference in time spent walking of 30 min per day (as
measured by activPAL), at a 5% significance level (Dall,
utilising unpublished data from [18]). Allowing for a
drop-out rate of 25%, the final target sample size was 40
per group.
Study participants
Recruitment of participants took place between April
2013 and November 2014 until the target sample size
was reached. A multi-point recruitment strategy was
implemented using advertisement of the study on local
radio and press, veterinary surgeries and other loca-
tions such as day centres, community groups, and
local libraries. Participants were also given the oppor-
tunity to recommend others for the study although
these participants were excluded from becoming the
recommender’s matched pair to prevent social influ-
ences on outcome measures. Three distinct geograph-
ical regions in the U.K. (Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and
Cambridgeshire,
selected
for
convenience)
were
targeted concurrently.
Participants (both DO and NDO) needed to be aged
65 years or over, reside in a private residence in one of
the three chosen geographical areas, have no scheduled
health intervention(s) that could alter their PA during
the time of data collection (e.g. scheduled surgery) and
be able to walk unaided for a minimum of 10 min con-
tinuously. For DO, the latter criterion also applied to
their dog(s). Participants were not excluded based on
the presence or absence of specific mental or physical
health
conditions.
Participants
were
assigned
into
matched pairs of DO and NDO based on age [+/−
5 years], gender, ethnicity, and socio-economic status
[matching quintile of Townsend index [19] , derived
from home postcode]. An additional matching factor of
cat ownership was included since previous research pro-
vides conflicting evidence on the influence of this on
physical activity [11, 20, 21]. At no stage during the
study were participants made aware of any details of
their matched pair.
Data collection
PA and SB were objectively measured using a water-
proofed activity monitor (activPAL™). The activPAL
monitor has been validated for both postural classifica-
tion and additional outcome measures in adults and
older adults [15, 17].
Data collection took place between April 2013 and
November 2014. For each participant, data were gath-
ered during three data collection periods across a
period of a year. Each data collection period lasted one
week which occurred within one of three designated
sampling
intervals
(March–June,
July–October,
November–February) to ensure data was collected
across a range of seasons for each participant. Within a
matched pair, data collection periods for the partici-
pants occurred within a four-week period. Initial data
collection occurred throughout the year ensuring the
first data collection period was not always in the same
sampling interval.
Information used for matching was gathered at re-
cruitment. At the first data collection period, partici-
pants provided further self-report information about
themselves (see Additional file 1), including, height and
weight (used to calculate BMI), chronic health condi-
tions (self-reported presence/absence of at least one
health condition), and distance that could be walked
continuously (0.8, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8, 6.4, 8.0+ km; question
asked in units of miles). At each data collection period,
participants in the dog-owning group also provided
demographic information about their dog(s), including
age, type (pedigree, mixed breed, crossbreed), size (giant,
large, medium, small, toy; examples were provided in the
questionnaire), gender, and length of ownership. They
also provided details of their role in caring for the
dog(s), for example, what percentage of total responsibil-
ity they had for the dog, and whether the dog was usu-
ally walked on or off lead (see Additional file 1). In
addition, when wearing the activity monitor, all partici-
pants completed a diary reporting the times they went
to bed/got up, and the estimated times they fell asleep/
woke up. This information allowed activity and SB
related to waking times to be extracted from the
activPALs.
Study outcomes
Outputs from the activPAL monitors and information
from the walking diaries were processed by a researcher
(PD) blind to the groups. Data were downloaded and
categorised using proprietary software (PALtechnologies
version 7.1.18). Self-reported waking times from the
diary were used in a hierarchical manner [(a) estimated
Dall et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:496 
Page 3 of 9
 sleep/wake times; (b) reported bed/get up times; (c) vis-
ual inspection] to isolate waking activity data. When
diary data was not available, a second independent
(blinded) researcher (BS) visually reviewed the activPAL
output and estimated the waking period each day from
the first and last activity in the day.
Outcome measures were calculated for the waking
day via the event output from the activPAL monitor
using a custom Excel macro. An event is defined as a
continuous period of a single posture or activity [22].
Waking and sleep times were used exactly as recorded.
Any event crossing the wake/sleep time was cut at that
point, and only the part within the waking day was in-
cluded in analysis. PA outcomes were the time spent
walking, the time spent walking with a cadence of over
100 steps/min (equivalent to MVPA [23]), the number
of steps taken and the time spent standing. SB mea-
sures (see [24]) were time spent sedentary, number of
sedentary events, and the number and time spent
sitting in prolonged sedentary events (> 30 mins).
Although the duration of the waking day may have var-
ied within and between participants, the proportion of
the waking day engaged in an activity were not used for
analysis, because choices, such as time of getting out of
bed, may have formed an integral part of the lifestyle of
participants. Finally, a binary outcome measure based
on adherence to current PA guidelines for older adults
(150 min per week of moderate PA [6]) was calculated
using the total time spent walking at a moderate ca-
dence across the data collection period. A pro rata
threshold for duration of moderate activity was created
based on the number of days of data assessed [i.e.
150 min per week* (number of days of assessment/7)],
and participants were judged to have met the guidelines
if they exceeded this threshold. This outcome measure
was
calculated
separately
for each
data
collection
period for each participant.
Statistical analysis
The same blinded researcher who undertook the data
processing performed the statistical analyses. Data from
a data collection period for a given participant was in-
cluded in the analysis if there were at least three waking
days at that data collection period. Pairs of participants
were included in analysis if there were data from at least
one data collection period for each participant in the
pair. Baseline demographic variables and matching char-
acteristics and hours awake during the day were com-
pared between groups using paired t-tests or related
samples Wilcoxon signed ranks tests as appropriate.
Linear mixed effects models, with dog ownership as a
fixed effect and a random effects structure of data col-
lection period nested in participant nested in pair, were
conducted to assess the effect of dog ownership on all
physical activity and sedentary behaviour outcomes. For
the proportion of individuals meeting pro-rata PA guide-
lines, a generalised linear mixed effect model was
performed, with binomial distribution and logit link
function, using the same random and fixed effects struc-
ture. Continuous data were log10 transformed as re-
quired based on inspection of the residuals, checking for
assumptions of normality and constant variance. Where
significant by a likelihood ratio test, the residual variance
was weighted by dog ownership group. Mixed effects
models using restricted maximum likelihood allow for
estimation in the presence of missing data, therefore no
imputation of data was deemed necessary. The effect of
data collection period (time through study) on the mea-
sures was explored as both additive and multiplicative
interactions with group. The model was not significantly
improved by their inclusion (as tested by likelihood ratio
tests) for any outcome, and so data collection period
was removed from subsequent analysis. The aim of this
study was to assess differences between groups (dog
owners and non-dog owners) using matched pairs of
participant to account for variability between groups.
Matching was extremely successful, and additional test-
ing for confounders was not performed in the models.
Data were analysed using R (version 3.3.1) with libraries
lme4, nlme and mutcomp, and a p-value of 0.05 was
used to indicate significance.
Results
Progress of the participants through the study is re-
ported in Fig. 1. In total, 19 participants withdrew from
the study, but in two of the pairs it was possible to
replace the withdrawn participant with a different par-
ticipant who was recruited and awaiting a match and
who also met the matching criteria. The number of par-
ticipants with data included in analysis was relatively
similar
across
all
sampling
intervals
(March–June,
n = 77; July–October, n = 59; November–February,
n = 82), with slightly lower levels of data collection over
the summer.
Among those included in data analysis, compliance
with wearing the monitor was excellent, with 92% (201/
218 included datasets) having the full seven days of data.
In total just 2% of potential days of data were not avail-
able for analysis. Most of the wake times used in the
analysis (1310/1499 days, 87%) were derived from esti-
mated wake and sleep times reported in the diary, with a
further 11% (166 days) derived from diary reported bed
times. Just 2% (34 days) of wake times were derived from
the activPAL record.
Demographic data on participants are summarized in
Table 1. Participants were white British (100%), mostly
women (n = 54, 66%), aged (mean ± standard deviation
(range)) 70 ± 4 (65–81) years, and most (n = 78, 91%)

 did not own a cat. Participants tended to live in less de-
prived areas, only 10 participants (12%) lived in the two
most deprived quintiles using the Townsend Index.
Although matched by Townsend Index quintile, pairs of
participants lived (median (interquartile range) [range])
13 (23) [0–60] km apart. The mean BMI of participants
indicated they were overweight (25.6 ± 4.0 kg.m−2) ran-
ging between underweight (18.9 kg.m−2) and obese
(35.8 kg.m−2). Just over a third of participants reported
having one or more chronic health condition at the start
of the study, these included cardio-vascular and arthritic
conditions, osteoporosis and visual impairment. The
mean self-reported distance that participants could walk
without stopping was 6.3 ± 2.4 km. The matching of
pairs used in this study was extremely successful, the
two groups were identical for all categorical outcomes
(gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and cat owner-
ship), and were not significantly different for the age at
start of study, p = 0.560. Additionally, there were no
statistical differences between groups for other demo-
graphic characteristics, BMI (p = 0.612), number of par-
ticipants with a chronic health conditions (p = 0.821), or
self-reported walking distance (p = 0.564).
Information on dogs owned was missing for two DOs.
The remaining 43 DOs in this study owned 61 dogs, in
total. Most DOs (n = 41, 95%) owned either one (n = 31,
72%) or two (n = 10, 23%) dogs, while the other two
DOs owned four and six dogs. About half of the DOs re-
ported that they were solely responsible for care (n = 17,
40%) and exercise (n = 23, 53%) of their dog(s). Of those
DOs who shared responsibility for their dog(s), only a
small number reported providing less than half of that
care (n = 2) and exercise (n = 1). About half the dogs
were female (n = 31, 49%), and most (n = 46, 75%) were
neutered. Dogs were aged 7.7 ± 3.7 (0.3–15.0) years, and
had been owned for most of their life 6.0 ± 3.7 (0.2–

 15.0) years. Most of the dogs owned were pedigree
(n = 42, 69%), and the dogs were spread across a range
of sizes (n = 20, 33% toy and small; n = 23, 38% medium;
n = 18, 30% large and giant). Just under half of the dogs
(n = 29, 46%) were usually walked on the lead.
Four outcome measures were successfully log10 trans-
formed prior to analysis, and six benefitted from a model
allowing heterogeneity of dog ownership group variances
(Table 2). Participants were awake for 16.3 ± 1.0 (12.8–
18.8) hours per day, with no significant difference be-
tween groups (p = 0.797).
DOs walked for significantly longer than NDOs overall
and at a moderate cadence (Table 2). Consequently,
DOs took significantly more steps than NDOs. The dif-
ference between the groups in time spent walking at
least at a moderate cadence, of 21 min with 95%CI (12,
34 min), was similar to the difference in total time walk-
ing, 23 min with 95%CI (12,36 min), suggesting that the
additional walking performed by the DOs was at a mod-
erate cadence. Across all three data collection periods,
significantly more DOs (87% (95%CI 61, 96)) than NDOs
(47% (95%CI 19, 77)) met physical activity guidelines of
150 min of moderate activity per week (OR 75 (95%CI 3,
2167), p = 0.015). There was no significant difference
between groups in time spent standing (Table 2). DOs
and had fewer sedentary events, however there were no
significant differences between the groups for time sed-
entary in total, the number or the duration of prolonged
sedentary events (Table 2).
Discussion
In this study owning a dog indicated a large, potentially
health improving effect [25]: on average 20 min of add-
itional time spent walking and 2700 additional steps per
day with this additional walking undertaken at a moder-
ate cadence (≥100 step/min). Indeed, the size of the dif-
ference may be sufficient to meet PA guidelines on its
own (22 min of MVPA every day would achieve 150 min
of MVPA per week). It is not surprising, therefore, that
DOs were more likely to meet PA guidelines (87%,
95%CI 61, 96) than NDOs (47%, 95%CI 19, 77). Add-
itionally, older adult DOs had 8 fewer sedentary events
on average, but there was no difference in time spent sit-
ting in total, in prolonged sedentary behaviour, or in
time spent standing between the groups.
Previously reported group differences in MVPA in
adults and adolescents, based on use of the ActiGraph
were statistically significant, but often small (~2 min/
day; [12, 26]). A small difference of 2 min/day is unlikely
to have a large impact on health. The current study also
found a larger difference in total step count (2700 steps)
associated with dog ownership, than the difference
found in the only other comparable study (1700 [13]).
Although differences in total step count on their own do
not provide information about the intensity at which
they were taken, the PA guidelines could be achieved by
taking 2200 steps per day (22 min per day, at a moderate
cadence of 100 steps/min). Both studies, therefore, indi-
cate a meaningful increase in walking due to dog owner-
ship. In general, the NDOs in this group of older adults
(7200 steps/day; 96 min/day walking) were within, but
towards the top of, normal ranges, while the DOs
(10,000 steps/day, 119 min/day walking) often exceeded
usual ranges of PA compared to the general population
of community dwelling older adults, (30–60% meeting
guidelines, measured using self-report and ActiGraph
[27, 28]).
Although not-significant, this study demonstrated a re-
duction in objectively measured SB of 19 min associated
with dog ownership. Although there are no firm guide-
lines on SB and health, a dose relationship is apparent
[3]. For example, a 1 h reduction in self-reported SB was
equivalent to a 3% reduction in mortality in older
women [29]. The scale of the difference associated with

 dog ownership in this study (19 min less time spent sed-
entary per day), is therefore likely to have a small posi-
tive influence on health. The only other study to assess
objectively measured SB, used the ActiGraph and found
a smaller and non-significant reduction in SB of 7 min/
day in adolescents associated with household dog owner-
ship [26]. Differences in measured sedentary behaviour
may be due to different monitors used (assessing low
movement versus posture), measurement protocol (re-
moved overnight versus reported sleep), or differences in
population behaviour (adolescents versus older adults).
Of particular interest, is the composition of activity over
a 24-h day. Given that the duration of a day is constant,
a change in time spent in one type of activity, must re-
sult in a consequent and opposite change in time spent
in other activities. In this study, there was little differ-
ence between the groups in time spent standing or time
spent asleep, which implies that the reduction in time
spent sedentary for the DOs (19 min reduction) was
transferred into time spent in MVPA (21 min increase).
Although the inter-relationship of sleep, SB and PA
across the day is complex and under-researched [30], re-
cent isotemporal time substitution analysis indicates that
transfer of time spent sedentary to time spent in MVPA
provides the maximum potential benefit to health [31].
Dog ownership represents a complex behavioural rela-
tionship between the DO, the dog(s), and other mem-
bers of the household (including other pets). Owning a
dog does not necessarily mean that an individual either
cares for, or walks with, the dog. In some studies, dog
walking, as opposed to dog ownership is assessed (e.g.
[13]), and the general consensus in the literature is that
it is dog walking, rather than dog ownership, which posi-
tively influences PA. In this study, the factor distinguish-
ing groups was dog ownership, but we also assessed
levels of self-reported caring for the dog. Most of the
DOs in this study reported having sole responsibility for
care of and walking the dog, with only one DO reporting
less than 50% responsibility for walking the dog. A fur-
ther factor that may influence the relationship of dog
ownership and dog walking is the number and type of
dog(s) owned. Factors which may influence this include
gender, age, size [32, 33], breed, neuter status, tempera-
ment, energy [32] and behaviour of the dog [33, 34].
Theoretically, walking dogs on the lead may involve the
DO walking slowly and stopping frequently, or dogs may
get additional exercise when not on the lead. These fac-
tors should however be explored in more depth in
future.
Although this study provides the best quality data to
date on the effects of dog ownership on PA, there are
several potential limitations to consider. Participants
were volunteers and so may have been more physically
active than the general population, so the results may
not be completely generalisable. Any potential bias in
the volunteers would apply to the NDOs as well as the
DOs, and both groups had similar levels of health for
the aspects we assessed, and so the results are valid for
indicating the magnitude of effect. It should also be ac-
knowledged that few volunteers were recruited from
the lowest quintile of SES, and all volunteers had white
British ethnicity, which may also limit the applicability
of the findings to wider contexts. We did not assess the
effect of confounders within our statistical models,
however the matching between pairs of participants
was excellent for common confounders, and therefore
this is unlikely to have had a large influence on the dif-
ference between groups. The study was only powered
to be able to detect changes in physical activity, and it
is possible that a larger study would have detected a
significant difference in sedentary behaviour outcomes.
The design of this study does not allow any inference
to be made about whether more active people are likely
to own dogs, or whether DOs become more active
through owning a dog.
A considerable strength of the study was use of an ap-
propriate objective monitor to measure PA and SB. The
activPAL monitor is considered a gold standard for
measuring SB [15], and is accurate for measuring step
count in older adults at normal walking speeds [17]. The
monitor is also able to assess MVPA, using a threshold
of cadence generally held to be at a moderate level. Be-
cause this is applied to the average cadence across an
entire walking event, regardless of length, this assess-
ment avoids issues involved with dividing PA data into
arbitrarily defined units [35]. Although the ActiGraph
monitor is generally held to be a good measure of
MVPA, thresholds derived from laboratory based cali-
bration studies are required to derive time spent in
MVPA from hip acceleration [36]. A variety of different
thresholds exist [30], differing between adults [e.g. 12]
and children [e.g. 26], which can limit the ability for
comparison between studies. Compliance with monitor
wear and study protocols was high, leading to 92% of
participants having a full 7 days data, this probably re-
flects our individualized recruitment strategy, and the
ease of monitor wear, compared to larger generic stud-
ies. This compares favourably with other studies, for
example, in the 2003–2004 National Health and Nutri-
tional Examination Survey, only 67% of returned moni-
tors had at least 4 days of data available for analysis [4].
As the monitor was worn continuously, including over-
night and during water-based activities we were able to
assess all PA and SB undertaken throughout the week.
Measuring participants three times throughout a year
allowed a robust assessment of whether a difference in
PA is apparent throughout the year. Previous cross-
sectional research into the influence of dog ownership
Dall et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:496

 on PA has generally not matched participants, instead
breaking a group of recruited individuals into sub-
groups based on their dog ownership status. In this
study pairs of DOs and NDOs were matched on a range
of basic characteristics (age, gender, ethnicity, SES, and
cat ownership). Whilst there is a wide range of influ-
ences on both PA and SB behaviour, which may act on
different levels (e.g. individual, environment, policy) [37],
matching groups for some of the more basic characteris-
tics has allowed the influence of dog ownership on PA
and SB to be more effectively isolated.
Conclusions
This study found that older adult DOs walked on aver-
age 20 min a day longer than NDOs. These results con-
firm previous studies where DOs reported more walking
than NDOs, but also indicate that the additional walking of
DOs was undertaken at a moderate cadence. On average,
DOs met recommended public health guidelines (30 min/
day of moderate PA), but NDOs did not. Owning a dog,
may therefore motivate older adults to engage in appropri-
ate levels of PA for health. Health promotion professionals
could consider encouraging appropriate dog ownership, or
shared care of a dog to promote PA in older adults. The
scale of the influence of dog ownership on PA found in this
study, indicates that future research regarding PA in older
adults should assess and report dog ownership and/or dog
walking status. It is important to note that even if dog own-
ership is not the focus of a piece of research examining PA
in older adults it may represent an important explanatory
factor which should not be ignored.
