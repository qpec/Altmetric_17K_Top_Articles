Abstract
Preventing the formation of hypertrophic scars, especially those that are a result of major trauma 
or burns, would have enormous impact in the fields of regenerative and trauma medicine. In this 
report, we introduce a non-invasive method to prevent scarring based on non-thermal partial 
irreversible electroporation. Contact burn injuries in rats were treated with varying treatment 
parameters to optimize the treatment protocol. Scar surface area and structural properties of the 
scar were assessed with histology and non-invasive, longitudinal imaging with polarization-
sensitive optical coherence tomography. We found that partial irreversible electroporation using 
200 pulses of 250 V and 70 μs duration, delivered at 3 Hz every 20 days during a total of five 
therapy sessions after the initial burn injury resulted in a 57.9% reduction of the scar area in 
comparison with untreated scars and structural features approaching those of normal skin.

Introduction
Wound care costs the U.S. healthcare system more than $20 billion each year, and care 
required to combat skin scarring represents an additional $12 billion burden (Sen et al. 
2009). Hypertrophic scarring (HTS) after trauma and burn injury remains a major clinical 
challenge that leads to physical, aesthetic, functional, psychological, and social stresses in 
thousands of patients (Sen et al. 2009). Current data show that alterations in coagulation, 
inflammation, angiogenesis, fibroplasia, contraction, remodeling and mechanical tension 
correlate with the formation of HTS (Aarabi et al. 2007; Wong et al. 2011; DiPietro 2012; 
Rees et al. 2015). But as of yet the mechanisms that induce HTS are not well understood. 
This gap in knowledge leads to limited clinical success in therapeutic procedures (Leventhal 
et al. 2006). Various techniques such as surgical excision, intralesional steroid or interferon 
injection, cryotherapy, laser therapy, electron-beam irradiation, mechanical compression 
dressing, silicone sheet application, and combinations thereof have been tested to treat scars 
over the years (Leventhal et al. 2006; Mofikoya et al. 2007; Rabello et al. 2014). Despite all 
of these efforts, a recent meta review shows that there are only modest improvements in the 
healing outcomes among all these treatments (Leventhal et al. 2006). In a parallel vein, 
encouraging results for tissue regeneration have been obtained using pulsed electric fields 
for tissue ablation, in a procedure known as irreversible electroporation (IRE) (Davalos et al. 
2005). IRE ablates tissue with short, pulsed electric fields that cause irreversible damage to 
cells by increasing the permeability of their cell membranes, but spare the neighboring 
extracellular matrix (ECM), large blood vessels, and other accessory structures (Rubinsky et 
al. 2007; Charpentier et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2010; Golberg et al. 2015a).
Inspired by recent clinical reports on the potential reduction of fibrosis in the liver after IRE 
instead of radiofrequency ablation (Rubinsky et al. 2007; Narayanan 2011), and on 
combined bleomycin and electroporation treatment of HTS and keloids in humans (Manca et 
al. 2013), we set out to test the hypothesis that partial IRE (pIRE) ablation of the cells in the 
remodeling scar reduces scarring and diverts the wound healing process towards scarless 
regeneration. This hypothesis resides on the assumption that pIRE prevents delayed 
myofibroblast apoptosis (Robson 2003) and reduces the number of fibroblasts in the wound, 
thus creating more room for the secreted collagen to organize normally. However, pIRE of 
the skin is challenging as this treatment may also lead to abnormal wound healing, 
contractions and increased scarring, or even chronic wounds, if inappropriate parameters are 
used.
In previous work with healthy, normal skin and liver tissue, we showed that IRE preserves 
the extracellular matrix, but completely ablates the cells, and leads to scarless regeneration

 with the formation of organ appendages (Golberg et al. 2013b, 2015a). No scar or tumor 
formation has been observed during the six months of these studies. We have also developed 
pIRE protocols for rejuvenation of skin (Golberg et al. 2015b). In that work we showed that 
a single application of pIRE to normal skin in rats triggers the secretion of new collagen, the 
formation of additional capillaries, the proliferation of the epidermis, and increases the total 
metabolic activity in the treated area (Golberg et al. 2015b). In addition, we also have 
developed methods to control fibroblast cell populations using intermittently delivered pIRE 
in cell cultures (Golberg et al. 2013a), and to disinfect third degree burns with complete IRE 
of the infecting bacteria (Golberg et al. 2014). Here, we present a protocol for a therapeutic 
procedure based on intermittently delivering pIRE to burn wounds to prevent scarring.
pIRE is defined through multiple parameters such as 1) electric field strength, 2) pulse 
duration, 3) pulse number, 4) pulse frequency and 5) frequency of treatment delivery, which 
all have to be optimized to improve the therapy result. In our previous work, using a Taguchi 
robust experimental design approach we determined the electric field strength and the 
number of pulses to be the most important pIRE parameters for skin rejuvenation (Golberg 
et al. 2015b). Accordingly, we limited the number of tested parameters in the present study 
to 1) electric field strength, 2) number of pulses and 3) frequency of treatment delivery. To 
evaluate the impact of each of these parameters and to efficiently optimize the therapy 
protocol, we used Taguchi LS9 orthogonal arrays for the design of experiment (DOE) (Rao 
et al. 2008). Taguchi arrays determine the impact of individual parameters on the overall 
outcome of complex processes, even when several parameters are involved simultaneously 
(Rao et al. 2008), and are a convenient tool for biomedical engineering.
To assess the effect of pIRE on the scar formation, we treated third degree burn injuries in 
rats for three months. We used the Taguchi robust experimental design for screening and 
optimizing pIRE parameters. In this study we tested the applied voltages of 125 V, 250 V 
and 500 V; number of pulses of 200, 400 and 800; and therapy delivery every 10 days, 20 
days or 30 days after the third degree burn injury. The tested output parameters were scar 
surface area, collagen density and collagen fiber directional variance assessed by histology, 
and skin optical properties as detected with in vivo imaging with polarization sensitive 
optical coherence tomography (PS-OCT) (Lo et al. 2016).
Results
The experimental scheme and treatment schedules are displayed in Fig. 1. We applied the 
first electric field treatment (Fig. 1b, c) immediately after generating the third degree burns. 
Fig. S1 presents burn injuries in equally treated validation animals at up to 1 week after the 
injury to demonstrate full thickness burns. The treatments were delivered at the specified 
time intervals (Fig. 1c) for three months and the wounds were left to heal for an additional 
three months after the delivery of the last treatment. Nine combinations of the possible pIRE 
parameters were tested. The wound healing was monitored by visual inspection, digital 
photography, and with PS-OCT (Lo et al. 2016) for the entire six months after the burn 
injury.

 To evaluate the impact of pIRE on the wound healing, we measured the scar surface area 
(Figs. 2 and S2) and assessed features from the analysis of PS-OCT (Figs. 3, S3, S4, S5) 
and histology (Figs. 3, S6, S7, S8). From histological sections we measured the collagen 
fiber density and the fiber directional variance at the center of the original wound (Fig. S6). 
Fully developed scars are expected to have a higher density of fibers, paired with a lower 
directional variance, i.e. the fibers are more organized and less intercalated than in normal 
skin. For PS-OCT, we performed a texture analysis of the imaged birefringence to express 
its homogeneity, and extracted the slope of the degree of polarization (DOP) along the depth 
of the scar. Fully developed scars have homogenous birefringence with a slowly decreasing 
DOP, whereas normal skin has a very heterogeneous birefringence with a rapidly decreasing 
DOP. The impact of pIRE on all these features is summarized in Table 1. PS-OCT results 
and histology of a representative subset of the evaluated parameters appear in Fig. 3. The 
smallest scars were observed in the group of animals treated every twenty days (Fig. 3 
includes the results for in vivo PS-OCT imaging and histological analysis for this group). 
Additional PS-OCT and comparison with normal skin is shown in Fig. S3.
The largest reduction in the scar size (scar size 19.6±5.1mm2 vs 46.6±9.1mm2 in the 
untreated burns) was achieved with 250 Volts and 200 pulses, applied every 20 days for 3 
months after the burn injury (Fig. 2b, Table 1). A total of five treatments were delivered for 
this setting. This 57.9% reduction in scar size of pIRE treated wounds in comparison with 
untreated scars was accompanied by PS-OCT (Fig. 3k, u, vFig. S3) and histological (Fig. 3l, 
m, n, o, w, x) features approaching those of normal skin, indicating the regenerative effect of 
pIRE. Wounds treated with this pIRE setting showed a homogeneity of 0.486± 0.027 
(normal skin 0.427±0.013, untreated burns 0.570±0.027); DOP-slope of 0.383±0.060 
(normal skin 0.653±0.097, untreated burns 0.226±0.034), fiber density 0.821±0.111 (normal 
skin 0.421±0.011, untreated burns 0.796±0.178); and fiber directional variance 0.781±0.028 
(normal skin 0.879±0.027, untreated burns 0.637±0.085), indicating enhanced wound 
regeneration and resulting smaller scars (Fig. 3). In addition, PS-OCT further allowed for 
non-invasive monitoring of the wound healing in time (Figs. S4 and S5).
Six months after the third degree burn injury, histopathological analysis of untreated scars 
revealed large scars with a rectangular shape, as seen in histological cross-sections in the 
plane orthogonal to epidermis (Fig. 3b, c). The uniformly dense dermis (with a fiber density 
of 0.796±0.178 almost double the density of normal skin, 0.421±0.011, Fig. 3d) overlaid 
with a plaque-like epidermis featured collagen fibers that ran predominantly parallel to the 
surface without evidence of any normal pattern of intercalated collagen (fiber directional 
variance 0.637±0.085, in comparison to 0.879±0.027 in normal skin, Fig. 3e). There were no 
hair follicles or other skin appendages. The capillaries and venules were oriented 
perpendicular to surface (Fig. S7a). In contrast, pIRE treated wounds presented smaller scars 
(Fig. 2) with small hair follicles in the scar area (Fig. 3l, m yellow arrows,). Fig. S7 
Different from untreated, rectangular burn scars, pIRE treated scars featured a cross-
sectional shape of a trapezoid, with the shorter base oriented towards the epidermis. 
Nevertheless, in the center of the treated scars the fiber density was still larger than in 
normal skin (0.821±0.111). However, striking intercalation of collagen fibers in contrast to 
the linear arrangement in the untreated scars was observed (fiber directional variance in the

 pIRE treated wound was 0.781±0.028, in comparison to 0.637±0.085 in the untreated burn, 
and 0.879±0.027 in normal skin). The fiber architecture was close to normal, except that the 
fibers were thicker than in normal skin (Fig. 3n, o, w, x). The capillaries and venules in the 
dermis showed a close to normal, predominantly horizontal orientation (Fig. S7b, arrows).
Using Taguchi’s Robust Design Method (Rao et al. 2008), we optimized the pIRE 
parameters and analyzed the significance of each of the pIRE protocol parameters (applied 
voltage, number of pulses, and treatment frequency) on the metrics of the wound healing 
outcome (Supplementary Information 1). Determining the role of each of the pIRE 
parameters is crucially important as the results from different procedures vary substantially 
and the number of all possible combinations of pIRE parameters is large. For this analysis, 
we computed the ratio of the outcome parameters between the pIRE treated wound and the 
untreated control wound on each animal. First, using the Taguchi ranking approach we 
determined the importance of each of the treatment parameters on the change in the wound 
healing parameters (Table S3). Treatment frequency was the most important parameter for 
the reduction of the scar surface area. Applied voltage was the most important factor for the 
improvement of fiber density, fiber directional variance, and PS-OCT homogeneity of pIRE 
wounds in comparison to untreated burns. The number of pulses was the most important 
parameter for bringing the DOP-slope of the treated wounds closer to that of normal skin. 
Second, we determined the best setting for each of the three pIRE parameters by 
individually optimizing the healing outcome, assessed with 1) scar surface area, 2) fiber 
density, 3) fiber directional variance, 4) homogeneity, and 5) DOP-slope. We found that 
optimum values of voltage (Level 2, 250 Volts), number of pulses (Level 1, 200 pulses) and 
treatment frequency (Level 2, 20 days) exist for diminishing the scar size (Fig. S8a). None 
of the tested parameters had a significant effect on the fiber density in the center of the 
analyzed ROI (Fig. S8b). The optimum voltage for increasing the fiber directional variance 
was Level 2 (250 Volt); the number of pulses and treatment frequency did not have a 
significant impact on fiber directional variance in the healed wound (Fig. S8c). Similar 
results were observed for homogeneity: the optimum voltage was at Level 2 (250 Volts) and 
number of pulses and treatment frequency did not play a major role in the changes of this 
parameter (Fig. 8d). The optimum DOP-slope was achieved with applied voltage Level 2 
(250 Volt), Level 1 (200) number of pulses and slowest treatment frequency (Level 3, 30 
days) (Fig. S8e). The optimum pIRE parameters to bring the wound properties closer to the 
values found in normal skin appear in Table S4.
Discussion
The complexity of the wound healing process and our limited understanding of its 
mechanisms and biology led to a lack of overall progress for improved wound healing. 
There is a critical need for new approaches for HTS research and therapy. Complex 
interaction between cells, extracellular matrix, signaling factors and environmental factors, 
such as oxygenation, are most often ignored in many proposed HTS therapies, which usually 
focus on a single target. This focus on single targets can lead to failure in clinical trials as 
recently happened with TGF-β3 based therapy in 2011 (Gauglitz 2013). Most recently, 
fractional laser ablation has been proposed to treat scars (Choi et al. 2014). The results from 
the clinical trials with this technology in burn patients are encouraging and report on textural

 improvement and a significant decrease of Vancouver, POSAS observer, and patient scores 
(El-Zawahry et al. 2015; Levi et al. 2016). However, therapy depth in skin is limited due to 
high scattering of light in skin, causing a fundamental impediment for this technology 
(Preissig et al. 2012). Cryotherapy, historically limited to small scar volumes (Block et al. 
2015), improved in the recent years and up to 51% reduction of the scar size after a single 
treatment have been reported (Har-Shai et al. 2008). Different types of radiotherapy, such as 
Brachytherapy, X-ray, and electron beam have been used for scar treatments; however, these 
technologies require special heavy equipment and need to be used carefully to avoid 
carcinogenesis (Block et al. 2015). In contrast to the currently used physical therapies 
discussed above, for electroporation-based therapies, the distribution of the electric fields 
depends on the electrical properties of tissues such as resistance and capacitance (Golberg et 
al. 2015a). Most recently, a therapy combining delivery of bleomycin with electroporation 
has been evaluated for the treatment of HTS and keloids in humans(Manca et al. 2013). 
Bleomycin is currently only approved for cancer therapies and has multiple side effects, the 
major of which is pulmonary toxicity (Reinert et al. 2013).
pIRE is the HTS treatment therapy affecting directly the cell membranes, preserving the 
wound, and without using chemicals or light. The best identified pIRE protocol includes 
three essential components: 1) an electric field strength corresponding to an applied voltage 
of 250V across electrodes separated by 2mm, 2) 200 pulses, and 3) five treatments delivered 
every 20 days starting at the time of injury. Using Taguchi orthogonal arrays, we have shown 
that this combination of parameters lead to the most significant improvement of the wound 
regeneration after third degree burns in terms of scar size, fiber orientation and partial 
regeneration of skin appendages.
We showed here that 57.9% reduction in the size of the scar surface area in comparison with 
untreated scars, 22% increase in fiber directional variance, 15% decrease in homogeneity 
and 70% increase in the DOP-slope were achieved experimentally in this work with 250V, 
200 pulses, 70μs, 3Hz delivered every 20 days five times after the injury. In comparison, 
125V, 200 pulses, 70μs, 3Hz delivered every 10 days 10 times after the injury led to only 
16.3% reduction in the scar surface area. All other treatment combinations led to outcomes 
within the range of 16.3% and 57.9% scar area reduction. The area of the scars was defined 
using manual segmentation of digital images. PS-OCT would offer the ability to 
automatically detect scar area and volume based on the quantitative polarization features of 
the imaged scars. However, the limited field of view of the employed system prevented from 
measurement of the complete scar area and volume.
We expect that additional improvement in the healing outcomes could be achieved using 
more precise delivery of the electric fields to the wound area. This could be achieved with 
flexible electrode grids to allow precise delivery of various electric fields to the different 
locations in the wound. An additional important issue to be addressed in following work is 
pain. A dense grid of electrodes could enable precise delivery of the electric fields to the 
upper layers of papillary dermis in humans, avoiding the exposure of large nerves in the 
skin. This solution could address an additional problem associated with electroporation 
therapies today, also observed in this study - muscle contraction (Arena et al. 2011; Golberg 
and Rubinsky 2012). Further optimization of the pIRE protocol could improve additional

 metrics of the skin regeneration, particularly the reduction of collagen fiber density in the 
center of the wound.
An additional problem in the field of scar therapy is the lack of understanding of the 
molecular mechanisms involved in scarring (Zhu et al. 2013). We are conducting ongoing 
research with the aim to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms resulting in 
improved skin regeneration after pIRE. One possible explanation is that pIRE accelerates 
apoptosis of fibroblasts, as delayed apoptosis in fibroblasts and fibroblast-like cells is 
thought to play a critical role in scar formation (Robson 2003).
A major obstacle in preclinical research of HTS therapies is the lack of validated animal 
models that correspond closely to wound healing in human adults. To date, animal models of 
tissue regeneration and repair have focused on amphibians, rabbits, pigs and small rodents 
(Ramos et al. 2008; Song et al. 2011). Our work is a first proof of concept animal study 
performed in small rodents, a model which obviously has its limitations in comparison to 
human burns. Compared to scarring in humans, there are fundamental biological and 
structural limitations associated with the described protocol (Ramos et al. 2008). For 
example, rats have panniculus carnosus in dorsal skin, a muscle that contributes to wound 
contraction. Unlike humans, rats do not develop hypertrophic scars. Therefore, the use of the 
rat animal model is the major limitation of this work. A further limitation is the constant 
position of control and treated wound areas on the dorsal skin of the rats, instead of using 
randomized locations. The location of the wound affects the formation of the scars, mediated 
by mechanical tension as one of the reasons (Aarabi et al. 2007). Future studies should 
perform location-matched comparisons of the treatment outcomes. The use of a large animal 
model would also reduce the impact of self-contraction on the wound. The next major step 
for pIRE applied to regenerative medicine would be a first clinical trial to demonstrate the 
safety and efficacy of this method in humans. Translation to human patients will also require 
the re-optimization of the pIRE parameters for human scars, to eventually enable the 
assessment of clinical outcomes in terms of scar appearance, pliability, tightness, 
neuropathic pain, and pruritus.
The pIRE approach developed in this work brings to the fore this non-thermal, chemical-free 
technology for HTS research and therapy. pIRE effects on tissue are very different from 
laser-induced tissue damage, because IRE allows for spatial and temporal control of viable 
cell density without any significant effect on the surrounding ECM, tissue oxygenation and 
mechanical properties (Rubinsky et al. 2007; Golberg et al. 2015b). This substantively 
different approach for scar therapy is expected to overcome the problems that have been 
associated with other surgical or chemical scar therapies. The general impact of the proposed 
method would be very substantial both clinically and scientifically for a broad spectrum of 
fibrotic diseases such as HTS, heart and kidney fibrosis.
Methods
Animal model
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (~250 g, N = 18, 6-weeks old) were purchased in Charles River 
Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Female animals were chosen since in humans hypertrophic

 scars have equal distribution between females and males (Gauglitz et al. 2011). Moreover, it 
has previously been shown that male sex hormones potentiate, while female hormones 
reduce burn-induced lung and gut injury in Sprague-Dawley rats, a common burn injury 
model (Ananthakrishnan et al. 2005). The animals were housed in cages with access to food 
and water ad libitum, and were maintained on a 12-hour light/dark cycle in a temperature-
controlled room. Pregnancy was prevented by housing the animals separate from male rats. 
All animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
(IACUC) of the Massachusetts General Hospital. All procedures were in accordance with 
the guidelines of the National Research Council.
Third Degree Burn Injury
Before the creation of third-degree burns, the animals (n=3 per each treatment group) were 
anesthetized with isoflurane and their fur was clipped along the dorsal surfaces. Burns were 
incurred by pressing the end of a pre-heated (≥ 95°C) brass block against the rat’s dorsum 
for 10 seconds, resulting in a non-lethal, full-thickness, third-degree burn, measuring 
approximately 1 cm2 (Fig. S1). Each burn was approximately 0.25% of the total body 
surface area (TBSA). Four burn injuries were performed on each animal at sites separated by 
2 cm along the head to tail axis, accounting for 1% TBSA of total burn area. The injury 
closest to the head was used as control and the other three injuries were subsequently treated 
with pIRE. The depth of the burn was evaluated histological at time 0, 12 hours and 1 week 
after the injury in additional (n=3 per time point) animals (Fig. S1).
Partial Irreversible Electroporation
Prior to pIRE treatment, animals (n=3 per treatment group) were anesthetized with 
isoflurane. Their fur was clipped along the dorsal surfaces and treated with depilatory cream 
(Sally Hansen®Div. Del Laboratories, Inc., Farmingdale. NY). Subsequently, burn injuries 
were treated with pIRE using contact electrodes with a surface area of 1 cm2, separated by a 
2mm gap. Square pulses of 70 μs duration at a 3 Hz repetition rate were delivered using a 
BTX 830 pulse generator (Harvard Apparatus Inc, Holliston, MA). Voltage, number of 
pulses, and treatment frequency are described in Table S1.
Polarization sensitive optical coherence tomography
PS-OCT was performed as reported in detail previously (Villiger et al. 2013; Lo et al. 2016). 
The system operated with a wavelength-swept laser source at an A-line rate of 54 kHz and a 
center wavelength of 1320 nm, achieving an axial resolution of 9.4 μm. We scanned 
rectangular regions of 10 × 5 mm, consisting of 2048 A-lines/image x 256 images, with a 
focused beam featuring a lateral resolution of 15 μm. The lesions were covered with a thin 
layer of ultrasound-gel as immersion liquid and apposed against a glass slide to center the 
superficial layers in focus. Two to three volumes were acquired for each lesion and time 
point, aiming to image the center of the lesion. For PS-OCT, adjacent A-lines were 
illuminated with alternating polarization states at an angle of 90° in Stokes space, and the 
signal was detected with a polarization diverse receiver. Longitudinal imaging was 
performed on all animals monthly up to 6 months after the injury.

 The data was reconstructed with spectral binning (Villiger et al. 2013), using 1/5th of the 
spectral bandwidth, a lateral Gaussian filter with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) 
equal to 12 adjacent Alines, and an axial offset of 48 μm to derive depth-resolved tissue 
birefringence. Tissue birefringence was expressed in deg/μm, corresponding to the amount 
of retardation per sample path. The DOP was evaluated independently for each spectral bin 
and input polarization state over the same lateral Gaussian kernel, and then averaged:
(1)
where Q, U, V and I are the spatially averaged components of the Stokes vector, n denotes 
the spectral bin, and p the input polarization state. DOP expresses the randomness of the 
measured polarization states in small neighborhood and scales from 0 (completely random) 
to unity (uniform). Close to the surface, the polarization states are usually well maintained, 
resulting in a DOP close to unity. As the light propagates deeper, and depending on the 
depolarizing properties of the tissue, the light gets increasingly depolarized, resulting in 
lower DOP values. The structural intensity tomograms are displayed in logarithmic scale as 
gray scale images. Birefringence was mapped from 0 to 1.2 deg/μm with an isoluminant 
color map (Geissbuehler and Lasser 2013) and overlayed with the gray-scale intensity 
image. DOP is scaled from 0.5 to 1 and is rendered in the same color map. For quantitative 
analysis, a cylindrical region of diameter 1 mm extending from the epidermis to the 
subcutaneous fat was centered on the lesion at each time point. Homogeneity of the 
birefringence was evaluated with the ‘graycomatrix’ function, available in the image 
processing toolbox in Matlab (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). It was computed with an 
offset of 5 pixels in the axial direction, and dividing the birefringence into 12 levels ranging 
from 0 to 1 deg/μm. For the slope of the DOP (DOP-slope), the DOP values were averaged 
at each depth across the cylinder, and then fit with a straight line.
Scar area quantification
Scar surface area was quantified from digital images with ImageJ software (Schneider et al. 
2012). All scar edges were traced as shown in Fig. 2 and the area was quantified using a 
calibrated internal length standard for each image.
Histology
Specimens were harvested 6 months following the burn injury, after the last PS-OCT 
imaging time point. Skin samples were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and cut 
into 7-μm sections. All samples were cut through the center of the wound along the line 
perpendicular to the head to tail axis of the animal. Sections were stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome stains. Tissues were processed and stained by 
Wellman Center Photopathology core and the Rodent Histopathology Core at Harvard 
Medical School. Slides were evaluated by three individual investigators, including an 
experienced dermatopathologist (MCM). Color images of each entire tissue section were

 acquired using NanoZoomer Digital Pathology System (Nanozoomer 2.0-HT slide scanner, 
Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan).
Automated image analysis of trichrome stain for fiber density and orientation
Fiber density and orientation were calculated from images of Masson’s Trichrome stained 
sections using previously established image processing algorithms(Quinn et al. 2015). 
Briefly, collagen fibers were identified from the images (regions of interest are shown in Fig. 
S4) where the ratio of blue-to-red intensities exceeded a value of 2. Local fiber density was 
determined by the relative amount of collagen-positive pixels within a 50 pixel (90 μm) 
radius. Fiber orientation surrounding each image pixel location was also computed, and 
directional statistics were employed to compute the local directional variance of the fibers 
within a 50 pixel radius. Directional variance provided a metric that was inversely 
proportional to the strength of fiber alignment in a preferred direction. Subregions of 
300×700 μm corresponding to the center of the PEF-treated tissue region were defined 
through blinded evaluation of the original trichrome images, and the average fiber density 
and directional variance were computed from each sub-region.
Statistical Analysis
All experiments were standardized, animals of the same age were used. We used three 
wounds from different animals for each pIRE. Nine wounds were used as untreated burn 
controls. Normal skin from untreated animals were used as a positive control. Statistical 
analysis was performed with the statistics toolbox of MATLAB, R2009b (MathWorks, 
Natick, MA, USA). Taguchi analysis was done as shown in Supplementary Information 1. 
Results are reported as Mean ± STDEV.
