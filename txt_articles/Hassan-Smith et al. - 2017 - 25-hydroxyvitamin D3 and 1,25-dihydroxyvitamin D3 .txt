Abstract
Age-associated decline in muscle function represents a significant public health burden.
Vitamin D-deficiency is also prevalent in aging subjects, and has been linked to loss of mus-
cle mass and strength (sarcopenia), but the precise role of specific vitamin D metabolites in
determining muscle phenotype and function is still unclear. To address this we quantified
serum concentrations of multiple vitamin D metabolites, and assessed the impact of these
metabolites on body composition/muscle function parameters, and muscle biopsy gene
expression in a retrospective study of a cohort of healthy volunteers. Active serum 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1α,25(OH)2D3), but not inactive 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3),
correlated positively with measures of lower limb strength including power (rho = 0.42, p =
0.02), velocity (Vmax, rho = 0.40, p = 0.02) and jump height (rho = 0.36, p = 0.04). Lean
mass correlated positively with 1α,25(OH)2D3 (rho = 0.47, p = 0.02), in women. Serum
25OHD3 and inactive 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (24,25(OH)2D3) had an inverse relation-
ship with body fat (rho = -0.30, p = 0.02 and rho = -0.33, p = 0.01, respectively). Serum
25OHD3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 were also correlated with urinary steroid metabolites, suggest-
ing a link with glucocorticoid metabolism. PCR array analysis of 92 muscle genes identified
vitamin D receptor (VDR) mRNA in all muscle biopsies, with this expression being nega-
tively correlated with serum 25OHD3, and Vmax, and positively correlated with fat mass.
Of the other 91 muscle genes analysed by PCR array, 24 were positively correlated with
25OHD3, but only 4 were correlated with active 1α,25(OH)2D3. These data show that
although 25OHD3 has potent actions on muscle gene expression, the circulating concentra-
tions of this metabolite are more closely linked to body fat mass, suggesting that 25OHD3
can influence muscle function via indirect effects on adipose tissue. By contrast, serum

 1α,25(OH)2D3 has limited effects on muscle gene expression, but is associated with
increased muscle strength and lean mass in women. These pleiotropic effects of the vitamin
D ‘metabolome’ on muscle function indicate that future supplementation studies should not
be restricted to conventional analysis of the major circulating form of vitamin D, 25OHD3.
Introduction
The effects of vitamin D on calcium homeostasis and bone health are well established. In
recent years there has been great interest in its non-skeletal actions, with growing evidence
from epidemiological, basic and clinical studies that vitamin D status is associated with effects
including those on muscle function, body fat, immunity and cardiovascular disease risk [1].
Myopathy has long-been recognised to co-exist with reduced bone mineralization in the severe
vitamin D deficiency states of rickets and osteomalacia [2]. In view of the great public health
burden of so-called ‘sarcopenia’ and age-associated declines in muscle strength and function,
there is significant interest in whether vitamin D may have a role in improving the healthy life-
span. Recent meta-analyses indicate that vitamin D supplementation in deficient elderly indi-
viduals reduces risk of falls [3]. There is also some evidence of beneficial effects on muscle
strength and physical performance, however this is limited by heterogeneity of study designs,
so that current guidelines do not recommend vitamin D supplementation for this indication
[4–6].
Although basic research using cell culture and animal models has identified pathways by
which vitamin D impacts upon muscle function, the situation in humans requires further
delineation. In particular, although biopsy studies have demonstrated changes in muscle mor-
phology in vitamin D deficient disease states, detailed analyses of the relationship between
vitamin D status and gene expression of muscle atrophy markers are lacking [1]. There is also
debate as to the optimal circulating levels of vitamin D, with further data on the impacts on
human health and function required [5]. Furthermore in clinical practice, vitamin D status is
defined by measurement of a single metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (25OHD3). Recently
developed high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
techniques allow the quantification of multiple vitamin D metabolites, and to date this
approach has not been used to assess their relationship with markers of muscle mass and func-
tion [7]. With these observations in mind, the aim of the current study was to perform an in-
depth analysis of the relationship between serum vitamin D metabolites and muscle phenotype
in a healthy human cohort.
Materials and methods
Subjects
116 Healthy human volunteers (79 women, 37 men; aged 20–74 years) recruited from local
populations underwent a study protocol as outlined previously and had vitamin D analysis
performed [8]. Briefly, significant medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, vascular dis-
ease, epilepsy, malignancy and inflammatory diseases, use of oral anticoagulants and preg-
nancy, were exclusion criteria. Subjects arrived at the National Institute for Health Research
(NIHR)-Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birming-
ham, UK in a fasted state and completed a 1-day study protocol. Baseline observations were
carried out and venous blood was obtained at the start of the study visit.

 Serum high-throughput vitamin D metabolite analysis by liquid
chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry
Measurement of vitamin D metabolites was performed by liquid chromatography tandem-
mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) as previously described [7]. Briefly, samples were prepared
for analysis by protein precipitation followed by supportive liquid-liquid extraction (SLE).
LC-MS/MS analysis was performed on a Waters AQUITY UPLC coupled to a Xevo TQ-S
mass spectrometer. A Lux Cellulose-3 chiral column (100 mm, 2 mm, 3 μm) was used for sepa-
ration, heated at 60˚C in a column oven. The mobile phase was methanol/water/0.1% formic
acid solution at a flow rate of 330 μl/min. The method was validated in accordance to US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for accuracy, precision, extraction recovery and
matrix effects, lower limit of detection and quantitation [9]. The vitamin D metabolites quanti-
fied for this study included 25OHD3, 25OHD2, 3-epi-25OHD3, 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 24,25
(OH)2D3.
Urine steroid profiling by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry
Subjects provided a 24 hour urine collection prior to the study day and on receipt a 30 ml ali-
quot was transferred to a universal container and stored at -80˚C pending analysis. Analysis by
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed, as described previously [8].
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan
Body composition analysis was performed using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
(Hologic Discovery with DXA software version Apex 3.0; Hologic Inc) (coefficient of variation
for fat and lean mass, <3%).
Muscle strength testing
Hand-held dynamometry: Peak absolute strength (kilograms) and relative handgrip strength
(kilograms of force per kilogram of body weight) were measured in triplicate bilaterally using
a dynamometer (Takei Instruments). Jump-plate mechanography: Measures of lower limb
strength were obtained using a ground force reaction platform (Leonardo System, Novotec)
under the supervision of a trained operator using a standard operating procedure [8].
Vastus lateralis muscle biopsy
Biopsies (n = 85; 45 women and 40 men) were performed by a single investigator (Z.K.H-S.),
using a percutaneous Bergstrom technique as described previously. Samples were snap frozen
in liquid nitrogen immediately following sampling and stored at -80˚C pending analysis.
Quantitative (real-time) PCR array analyses
Applied Biosystems reagents and pre-made gene expression assays were used. 18s rRNA was used
as a reference gene for singleplex analysis. Targets genes were FAM labelled, with the reference
gene being VIC-labelled. Reactions were performed using the Biomark system on a dynamic array
integrated fluidic circuit (Fluidigm, San Francisco CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocols.
Gene targets and assay IDs were as follows: VDR (Hs00172113_m1), CYP27B1Hs01096154_m1,

Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using Prism for Mac version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc) unless
otherwise stated. For PCR analyses, statistical tests were performed on ΔCT values. Data were
expressed in arbitrary units calculated by the formula 1000 × (2−ΔCT), or fold-change vs the 20-
to 40-year age group (2−ΔΔCT). Nonparametric tests were used with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s
post-test correction when comparing multiple groups. Bivariate correlations between variables
were performed using Spearman’s test. The LC/MS-MS lower detection limit of 32 pg/ml
resulted in left-censored data for the 1α,25(OH)2D3 metabolite with 42 samples above the
lower limit of detection. Further correlation analysis between this metabolite and gene expres-
sion levels was carried out using the statistical package R [10] and the function cenken from the
NADA package [11]. Multivariate visualisation of correlations between metabolites of vitamin
D were carried out with the R function scatterplot matrix from the car package [12], with val-
ues <32 pg/ml plotted as 32; trend-lines were computed using built-in robust fitting. Multiple
linear regression analysis of performance measures on age, gender, BMI, and the metabolites
25OHD3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3 was carried out with the R package leaps [13], with 1α,25
(OH)2D3 coded as 0 below detection limit of 32 pg/ml and 1 above detection limit. The best
models with 1–5 variables included were constructed and variables with largest adjusted R2
values reported. Confidence limits for the Spearman rank correlation coefficient were calcu-
lated using GraphPad Prism, based on Fisher’s transformation [14].

 guidelines on the Practice of Ethical Committees in Medical Research issued by the Royal Col-
lege of Physicians of London. Recruitment ran from October 2010 to March 2013. Volunteers
were provided with written and verbal information and gave written informed consent. After
study completion, they received travel expenses, and clinically relevant results were communi-
cated to general practitioners.
Results
Subject characteristics
Subjects were spread across a broad age range with men and women represented (Table 1).
The cohort was healthy and non-obese, with blood pressure and body composition profiles
reflecting this. On grip strength measures as per European guidelines [15] only 4 females and
none of the men met criteria for sarcopenia. Serum analysis of multiple vitamin D metabolites,
revealed that 58% of the cohort were vitamin D deficient (total serum 25OHD <20 ng/ml, tak-
ing into account 25OHD2, 3-epi-25OHD3 and 25OHD3), 28% had insufficiency (20–30 ng/
ml) and 14% had normal levels (> 30ng/ml) on Endocrine Society guideline criteria. Whilst
42% had normal levels based on Institute of Medicine criteria (>20ng/ml) [5,16]. Serum con-
centrations of 1α,25(OH)2D3 were quantifiable (> 32 pg/ml) in 38 subjects. Comparative anal-
ysis of serum vitamin D metabolites showed statistically significant correlations between
25OHD3, 24,25(OH)2D3 and 3-epi-25OHD3 (rho = 0.92, p<0.0001 and rho = 0.72, p<0.0001
respectively); and between 24,25(OH)2D3 and 3-epi-25OHD3 (rho = 0.62, p<0.0001) (Fig 1).
There was no significant correlation between serum 1α,25(OH)2D3 and concentrations of
other vitamin D metabolites (Fig 1).

 negatively correlated with serum 25OHD3 and 24,25(OH)2D3, but not 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Fig
2A–2C). Conversely 1α,25(OH)2D3 was positively correlated with total lean mass, whilst the
other metabolites were not (Fig 2D–2F). In men, no significant associations were observed
between vitamin D metabolites and body composition parameters (serum 25OHD3 vs. total
fat mass rho = 0.01, 95% CI -0.33–0.35, p = 0.94, and vs. lean mass rho = 0.09, 95% CI -0.25–
0.42, p = 0.60; serum 1α,25(OH)2D3 vs. total fat mass rho = -0.36, 95% CI -0.78–0.29, p = 0.26,
vs. lean mass rho = 0.20, 95% CI -0.16–0.50, p = 0.26). In women, 25OHD3 was also negatively
correlated with BMI (rho = -0.34, 95% CI -0.58–-0.04, p = 0.02) and positively correlated with
HDL-C (rho = 0.33, 95% CI 0.06–0.55, p = 0.01).
Analysis of urinary steroid metabolites showed a significant negative correlation between
serum 25OHD3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 and (tetrahydrocortisol+5α tetrahydrocortisol)/ tetrahy-
drocortisone ((THF+5αTHF)/THE ratios (rho = -0.31, p = 0.02, and rho = -0.26, p = 0.047
respectively), and positive correlation with cortisol/cortisone (F/E) (rho = 0.28, p = 0.04, and
rho = 0.29, p = 0.03 respectively), indicative of negative associations with 11β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) type 1 and type 2 activities, respectively (Fig 3). These associations
were not seen in men, and not observed for 1,25(OH)2D3 (data not shown). No significant re-
lationships between serum 25OHD3 or 1α,25(OH)2D3 and fasting glucose, insulin or HOMA-
IR were observed.

 Vitamin D metabolites and muscle function parameters
In contrast to precursor 25OHD3, serum 1α,25(OH)2D3 concentrations correlated positively
with jump-plate mechanography measures including power (Pmax), velocity (Vmax) and
jump height (Fig 4A, 4B and 4C respectively and Table 2). Conversely, whereas 1α,25(OH)2D3
had no significant effect on the efficiency or ‘Esslinger’ performance index, which gives a mea-
sure of performance controlled for body weight, 25OHD3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 were positively
correlated with these measures (Table 2).

(b) 24,25(OH)2D3 correlated negatively with body fat (rho = -0.30, p = 0.02 and rho = -0.33, p = 0.01,
respectively), but not (c) 1α,25(OH)2D3 (rho = -0.06, p = 0.79). Conversely, lean mass correlated positively
with (f) 1α,25(OH)2D3 (rho = 0.47, p = 0.02), but not (d) 25OHD3 or (e) 24,25(OH)2D3 (rho = 0.03, p = 0.81,
and rho = 0.03, p = 0.80). Data were analysed by Spearman correlations (rho) with p values and line of best fit
shown.

 No significant correlations between other vitamin D metabolites and strength testing mea-
sures were observed. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that age (jump-height
p = 2.45e-8, Vmax p = 1.35e-7) and gender (jump-height p = 8.73e-9, Vmax p = 1.10e-9 and
grip strength p = <2e-16) were the strongest predictors of strength testing measures and that
these findings were highly significant. Furthermore, 1α,25(OH)2D3 coded as below/above
detection limit provided an improved model for jump height when added to age and gender,
assessed by adjusted R2 value, but fell short of statistical significance for the data available
alone (p = 0.128).
25OHD3, 1,25(OH)2D3, VDR and skeletal muscle gene expression
RT-PCR analysis of skeletal muscle mRNA showed that there was no detectable expression of
CYP27B1, the gene encoding the enzyme 1α-hydroxylase that catalyzes conversion of 25OHD3
to 1α,25(OH)2D3 (data not shown). In a similar fashion, mRNA for the vitamin D catabolic
enzyme 24-hydroxylase (CYP24A1) was also undetectable in the muscle biopsies (data not
shown). However, mRNA for the nuclear receptor for 1α,25(OH)2D3 (vitamin D receptor,
VDR) was detectable in the muscle biopsies (mean ΔCT = 18.7, 17.6–19.9), and correlated with

donor age, but correlated negatively with serum 25OHD3 concentrations and muscle Vmax
measurements, and positively with fat mass (Fig 5). There was no significant correlation
between VDR mRNA expression and serum 1α,25(OH)2D3, lean mass, BMC, jump height, grip

 strength or Vmax (data not shown). However, VDR mRNA expression was positively correlated
with 21 of the 91 other gene targets analysed by PCR array (Table 3).
Of the muscle genes analysed by PCR array 24 correlated positively with serum 25OHD3
(Table 4 and S1 Table). By contrast, only four genes correlated positively with serum concen-
trations of 1α,25(OH)2D3 (Table 4). When additional analyses to account for censored data
were performed a total of eight genes correlated positively with 1α,25(OH)2D3: LPL(p =
0.005), CD36(p = 0.01), PPARG(p = 0.01), HSP90B1(p = 0.01), PPP3R2(p = 0.02), PDK4
(p = 0.03), FOXO3(p = 0.03), FOXO1(p = 0.04). There was no overlap between genes that cor-
related with serum 25OHD3 and those that correlated with serum 1α,25(OH)2D3.
Discussion
To date the majority of cross-sectional studies of vitamin D and muscle function have focused
on circulating concentrations of 25OHD3, with some reports describing positive correlations
with a heterogenous range of muscle function measures and others describing no significant
associations, as outlined by Girgis and colleagues [1]. However, it is important to recognise
that 25OHD3 is a relatively inactive form of vitamin D, so that its effects on target tissues are
dependent on either systemic or localised metabolism to other vitamin D metabolites. The aim
of the current study was to clarify the metabolic mechanisms that underpin the actions of vita-
min D in human muscle.

 Use of 25OHD3 as the primary marker of ‘vitamin D status’ has obvious advantages in
terms of longer half-life and serum stability, as well as the direct link between vitamin D sup-
plementation/restriction and serum concentrations of 25OHD3. By contrast, serum concen-
trations of 1α,25(OH)2D3 are dependent not only on precursor 25OHD3, but also PTH, and
fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) that coordinate renal expression of the enzyme 25-hydro-
xyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) [17]. This is underlined by data presented in the cur-
rent study where there was no significant correlation between serum levels of 25OHD3 and
1α,25(OH)2D3. In contrast, serum 25OHD3, 24,25(OH)2D3 and 3-epi-25OHD3 levels were
strongly correlated. Concentrations of 1α,25(OH)2D3 were not quantifiable in some serum
samples, which reflects the overall low vitamin D status of the study cohort.
A small number of studies have assessed correlations between serum concentrations of
1α,25(OH)2D3, knee extension power [18] and reduced muscle mass and knee strength in
females under the age of 65 years [19]. Other vitamin D metabolites such as 24,25(OH)2D3
and 3-epi-25OHD3 have not been previously studied in relation to muscle function. It was
therefore interesting to note that circulating 1α,25(OH)2D3, was a better correlate of muscle
strength than precursor 25OHD3. Conversely, serum 25OHD3 had a greater impact than
1α,25(OH)2D3 on other muscle markers such as efficiency (a measure of the relationship
between maximum jump force and power, with the less force required to generate the same
power, the more efficient the jump) and the Esslinger fitness index (Pmax relative to weight
normalised to age and sex), as well as skeletal muscle gene expression. One potential explana-
tion for this is that systemic and locally-generated 1α,25(OH)2D3 have different effects on
muscle phenotype and function. It is interesting that both 25OHD3 and 24,25(OH)2D3 are
associated with body fat in addition to efficiency and Esslinger fitness index. It may be that the
added burden of fat in generating power and interaction with these metabolites plays a role in
these relationships. In addition, as 1α,25(OH)2D3 is positively correlated with Pmax but does
not reach significance with Esslinger, it is possible that age or sex impact these effects. It is also
possible that observed sex differences are due to lack of statistical power in view of smaller
numbers of men recruited to the study. The expression of VDR mRNA in muscle biopsies con-
firms previous observations for this receptor in human muscle and provides a mechanism for
1α,25(OH)2D3 responsiveness in muscle cells. Nevertheless, there is conflicting evidence as to
the true levels of VDR protein expression in human skeletal muscle due to questions over anti-
body specificity [20,21]. Furthermore it has been suggested that VDR levels change across the
life-course, but we found no evidence of this in our adult cohort.
Parallel analysis of the CYP27B1 in muscle biopsies did not reveal significant expression of
this gene (data not shown), suggesting that, unlike many other target tissues for vitamin D,

 localised conversion of 25OHD3 to 1α,25(OH)2D3 is not a prominent feature of muscle func-
tion. An alternative to this is that serum 25OHD3 exerts effects on muscle via an indirect
mechanism(s). Previous work from our group has described the role of pre-receptor glucocor-
ticoid metabolism via 11β-HSD1 in the muscle weakness of aging and steroid excess [8]. Our
observation in the current study that increased serum 25OHD3, but not 1α,25(OH)2D3 was
associated with reduced 11β-HSD1 activity highlights an important overlap between these two
steroid hormone metabolic systems. Suppression of 11β-HSD1 activity by increased serum
25OHD3 may help to promote muscle function through decreased levels of sarcopenic corti-
sol. Although there is existing evidence for cross-talk between these systems in diverse contexts
such as pregnancy, obesity, asthma and renal disease, no previous studies have focused on this
in the context of muscle health and this represents an area of immediate interest for the devel-
opment of mechanistic studies [22,23].
There is evidence of an inverse relationship between serum 25OHD3 and fat mass, such
that weight loss in obesity is associated with increasing levels of 25OHD3. Volumetric dilution
or sequestration of lipophilic vitamin D in adipose tissue are potential explanations for this
effect, however the exact mechanisms regulating this are undefined [24]. We observed that
1α,25(OH)2D3 was associated with lean mass, and 25OHD3, and 24,25(OH)2D3 were associ-
ated with fat mass in women. The observation regarding lean mass is unsurprising in that this
is closely associated with measures of muscle strength, which 1α,25(OH)2D3 is also correlated
with. Low serum 25OHD3 has previously been associated with a metabolically unfavorable
body composition, lipid and insulin resistance profile in post-menopausal women previously
and investigation of causality and the effects of replacement are required [25].
This is the first published report of jump-plate mechanographic analysis of an adult cohort
in relation to vitamin D. The advantages of this technique are that there is evidence of greater
re-test/inter-rater reproducibility along with improved sensitivity for sarcopenia compared to

Vitamin D metabolites and skeletal muscle
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0170665

 traditional tests of muscle function [26]. Previous studies have used various isometric and
physical performance measures to assess the impact of vitamin D on muscle function, with
data focused primarily on serum concentrations of 25OHD3 [1,27]. It was therefore interesting
in our healthy cohort, that active 1α,25(OH)2D3 (but not inactive 25OHD3) correlates with
muscle markers of maximum power, velocity and jump height, which are influenced by the
proportion of type II fast twitch muscle fibers. These fibers are preferentially lost in endocrine
myopathies as exemplified by severe vitamin D deficiency [2,28]. In a previously reported ado-
lescent female cohort jump-plate mechanography measures were shown to have a positive
relationship with 25OHD [29]. Possible explanations for the absence of a significant relation-
ship with grip strength observed in our cohort are that proximal lower limb muscle function is
more sensitive to vitamin D status, as seen in the osteomalacia phenotype of which jump-plate
measures would be more sensitive [15].
Early human studies described skeletal muscle morphological changes consisting of non-
specific/type II fast-twitch fiber atrophy and degeneration, that were reversible with vitamin
D supplementation in patients with proximal myopathy and osteomalacia [30]. However,
literature on the relationship between vitamin D and human skeletal muscle gene expression
changes is limited. We identified 24 skeletal muscle genes (out of 92 examined), which cor-
relate with serum 25OHD3 (Table 4 and S1 Table). These genes are involved in hormonal/
intracellular signalling, cell stress, proteosomal activity, protein translation, amino acid metab-
olism, muscle contraction, myogenesis and mitochondrial function. 1α,25(OH)2D3 was also
associated with genes involved in skeletal muscle metabolism, protection against cell stress, and
protein degradation. VDR forms a heterodimer with RXR in the presence of 1α,25(OH)2D3 to
influence gene transcription, we observed a positive relationship between serum 25OHD3 and
muscle RXR gene expression. Established VDR target genes such as PPARD and PPARGC1A,
which are involved in protection against an adverse metabolic phenotype (obesity, insulin resis-
tance) [31], were positively correlated with serum 25OHD3 in this study. This is also of interest
as these targets are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and energy metabolism, which vitamin
D has recently been shown to regulate [32]. Serum vitamin D was positively correlated with
MYH2, which is expressed in the fast type II muscle fibers that are preferentially lost in severe
vitamin D deficiency.
Associations between serum vitamin D and genes encoding components of TGF-beta/
myostatin signalling pathways were also seen with upregulation of SMAD3, SMAD4, ACVR2A
and downregulation of SMAD7. This is consistent with previous data demonstrating modula-
tion of SMADs by vitamin D, resulting in anti-proliferative effects and resolution of the rodent
model of multiple sclerosis [33]. We also observed a positive correlation with DDIT4, expres-
sion of which has been shown to be up-regulated by active vitamin D in vitro resulting in sup-
pression of mTOR activity with anti-proliferative effects [34]. This conflicts with results from a
murine skeletal cell culture model, which showed that active vitamin D treatment increased
protein synthesis via Akt-mTOR signalling [35]. Associations were also seen with targets
involved in protein translation, such as IGF1R, and eukaryoric translation initiation factors,
eIF4BP1 and EIF2B1. A previous study in rat chondrocytes, showed that vitamin D induces
upregulation of IGF1R expression, whilst IGF-1 stimulated VDR expression [36]. In view of
the similar morphology between endocrine myopathies common mechanisms and the inter-
play between hormonal axes is an area of potential interest. The positive relationship between
serum vitamin D and expression of several proteasomal subunits is unexpected, in that vitamin
D has previously been demonstrated to antagonise ubiquitin-proteasomal dependent degrada-
tion of myofibrils in vitro [37]. No significant associations were observed between vitamin D
and the muscle-specific ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx1 in this study however. Genes
involved in cell stress response were also positively associated with serum vitamin D including

 SOD1, CRYAB and HSP90AA. The negative correlation between serum 25OHD3 and skeletal
muscle VDR was unexpected; a previous study with a smaller number of participants reported
no relationship [38], and another study reported upregulation of VDR in response to 1α,25
(OH)2D3 [39]. Intriguingly, many of the gene expression associations with VDR (S1 Table)
were the inverse of those observed with 25OHD3, including those involved in TGFβ/myostatin
signalling, proteasomal and metabolic function. The precise explanation for this is unclear, but
may include ligand-independent actions of VDR, as well as indirect effects of 25OHD3 on
muscle mediated via responses in associated fat tissue.
Collectively these observations indicate that the link between vitamin D, muscle function
and sarcopenia is more complex than originally thought, and cannot be defined simply
through measurement of 25OHD3. General limitations of the study that should be taken into
account include its cross-sectional nature, which precludes us from confirming causality or
temporal effects. In view of the multiple parameters assessed, there is also the possibility of
type 1 errors occurring in statistical analysis, however the positive findings are greater than
would be expected assuming false discovery rate of 5%. Finally, baseline information on exer-
cise potential was not recorded, although all participants were ambulatory, community-
dwelling and not suffering from chronic diseases. Despite these caveats, data presented here
highlight the limitations of studies where only conventional serum 25OHD3 measures are
used. The distinct direct and indirect effects of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 25OHD3 respectively on
muscle function and gene expression suggest that multiple other factors must be considered
when assessing the physiological impact of vitamin D deficiency or supplementation. Notably
this includes measures of lean versus fat mass, and steroid metabolite profiles, but in future it
will also be important to include a more comprehensive analysis of the metabolites that make
up the vitamin D ‘metabolome’.
