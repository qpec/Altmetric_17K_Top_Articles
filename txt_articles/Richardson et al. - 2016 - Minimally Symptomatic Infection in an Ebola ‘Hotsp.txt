Abstract
Introduction
Evidence for minimally symptomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection is limited. During the
2013–16 outbreak in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologically relevant to pub-
lished models or projections of intervention effects. In order to improve our understanding
of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans, we investigated the occurrence of mini-
mally symptomatic EBOV infection in quarantined contacts of reported Ebola virus disease
cases in a recognized ‘hotspot.’
Methodology/Principal Findings
We conducted a cross-sectional serosurvey in Sukudu, Kono District, Sierra Leone, from
October 2015 to January 2016. A blood sample was collected from 187 study participants,
132 negative controls (individuals with a low likelihood of previous exposure to Ebola virus),
and 30 positive controls (Ebola virus disease survivors). IgG responses to Ebola glycopro-
tein and nucleoprotein were measured using Alpha Diagnostic International ELISA kits with
plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to
normalize well background) on a ChroMate 4300 microplate reader. A cutoff of 4.7 U/mL for
the anti-GP ELISA yielded 96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in distinguishing positive
and negative controls. We identified 14 seropositive individuals not known to have had
Ebola virus disease. Two of the 14 seropositive individuals reported only fever during quar-
antine while the remaining 12 denied any signs or symptoms during quarantine.

 Conclusions/Significance
By using ELISA to measure Zaire Ebola virus antibody concentrations, we identified a sig-
nificant number of individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ vil-
lage in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village outbreak. The findings
provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spec-
trum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. These data also
suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected
during the outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of trans-
mission and clinical sequelae in individuals with previously undetected EBOV infection.
Author Summary
With over 28,000 reported cases, the 2013–16 West African Ebola virus disease epidemic
is the largest and longest on record. This study provides further evidence that Ebola, like
other viruses, causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations that may include minimally
symptomatic infection. The findings also suggest that many episodes of human-to-human
transmission of Ebola virus in West Africa may have gone undetected in the recent out-
break. This has implications for the definition of Ebola virus disease survivorship, delinea-
tion of transmission chains, and future vaccine studies.
Introduction
Despite over 28,000 reported cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the 2013–16 pandemic as of
March 27, 2016 [1], we are only beginning to trace the complex biosocial processes that have
promoted spread of the virus [2,3]. Important questions remain, including how to best use
tools such as new vaccines [4] and rapid diagnostic tests [5] to contain future outbreaks, the
extent to which symptomatic individuals do not present for care, how to identify and manage
clinical sequelae of EVD [6], and the incidence and transmission dynamics of minimally symp-
tomatic Ebola virus (EBOV) infection.
Evidence for minimally symptomatic EBOV infection is limited. During the 2013–16 out-
break in West Africa, it was not considered epidemiologicallyrelevant to published models or
projections of intervention effects [7–10]. Moreover, it is not known if clinical sequelae seen in
survivors of EVD (e.g., uveitis) exist in individuals who had minimally symptomatic EBOV
infection.
In order to improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of EBOV in humans,
we investigated the occurrenceof minimally symptomatic EBOV infection in a recognized
Ebola ‘hotspot’ [11], which we defined as an area with a reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed EVD attack rate above 2% in a two-month period.
Methods and Results
To measure the occurrenceof EBOV infection in a group of people exposed to confirmed
cases, we validated a commercial ELISA kit in a cohort of patients with known Ebola status
and then used this tool to determine infection status in previously quarantined individuals.

 Ethics Statement
The study protocol was approved by the Sierra Leone Ethics and Scientific Review Committee
and the Stanford University Institutional Review Board (Protocol ID: 33882). We held meet-
ings with Paramount, Sectional, and Town Chiefs to discuss the proposal and supply them
with written information. We then held town meetings to describethe project and answer com-
munity questions. Individuals provided written informed consent or placed a thumbprint after
hearing a consent script read in the Krio or Kono languages (both ethics committees approved
the use of an oral script and thumbprint for those participants who could not read or write);
parents signed for children under the age of 18, and children and adolescents provided verbal
assent. Subjects received 50,000 Leones (~$10 US) for their participation in the study.
Setting
Kono is a diamond-rich district in eastern Sierra Leone which reported 301 cases of EVD (that
is, RT-PCR confirmed individuals who presented for isolation or were identified by surveil-
lance teams) between August 2014 and February 2015 (Kono District Ebola Response Centre
(DERC), personal communication). Several of the authors worked closely with the Kono
DERC, British military, and International Federation of the Red Cross on containment, isola-
tion, and surveillanceduring the time of active transmission in the district. Parts I and II of this
study were conducted from October 2015 to January 2016 by a team consisting of two physi-
cians, a physician-anthropologist, a laboratory technician, and two community health workers.
I. ELISA Validation.
We recruited 30 EVD survivors as positive controls by contacting
the director of the Kono Survivors’ Group and requesting that she identify individuals inter-
ested in participating in a serosurvey. Using Kono DERC records, we verified that survivors
had been admitted to an Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU) and had a documented RT-PCR positive
result for EBOV. To identify a group of people whom we considered at very low risk of previ-
ous EBOV infection to serve as negative controls, we used Kono DERC records to locate three
villages in Kono District in which no Ebola cases had been reported: In the villages of Tom-
bodu, Wardu, and Njagbwema, we recruited 132 individuals who denied contact with Ebola
cases both inside and outside of their communities.
We collected blood samples from participants in 4-mL EDTA BD Vacutainer tubes. The
tubes were stored at 4C until arrival at the laboratory. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation
(20 minutes, 1228g), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) were performed the
day of sample collection.
We assessed anti-glycoprotein (anti-GP) and anti-nucleoprotein (anti-NP) responses to
EBOV by means of commercial ELISA kits (AE 320620–1 and AE 320520–1, respectively)
from Alpha Diagnostic International (ADI), San Antonio, TX, USA. These were processed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with plasma diluted at 1:200. Optical density
(OD) was read at 450 nm (subtracting OD at 630nm to normalize well background) on a Chro-
Mate 4300 microplate reader (Awareness Technologies, Marina Del Rey, CA, USA). Values are
reported in units per milliliter (U/mL) with the use of reference antibody provided by the
manufacturer.
To determine overall accuracies for the two ELISAs in combination and individually, we
generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and compared the areas under the
curve (AUCs) for the individual and combined anti-GP and anti-NP tests [12]. The cutoff for a
positive test was established by ROC analysis, defined as the point along the ROC curve that
gave the highest sum of sensitivity (%) and specificity (%).
Fig 1 provides ROC curves and AUCs for the individual and combined ELISA assays. AUCs
for the anti-GP, anti-NP, and combined assays were 0.992 (SE = 0.005, 95% CI = 0.983–1.000),

 0.975 (SE = 0.010, 95% CI = 0.956–0.995), and 0.997 (unable to determine CIs as the combined
ROC was generated through logistic regression), respectively, suggesting that these three tests
were statistically equivalent. The cutoff for the anti-GP ELISA that yielded optimal sensitivity
(96.7%) and specificity (97.7%) was 4.7 U/mL.
II. Serosurvey. Study population. We conducted a serosurvey in Sukudu, a village of
approximately 900 inhabitants (100 households) that was one of three major ‘hotspots’ in
Kono District. We obtained a list of quarantined houses and EVD cases from the Kono DERC
and verified it with the town chiefs and youth leaders. We also interviewedmembers of all of
the affected households and discussed the identification of EVD cases with them to triangulate
DERC records. We defined potential participants as having been exposed to EBOV if they
stayed in a house that was quarantined based on sharing a public latrine with a confirmed case
or based on a confirmed case living there. All homes were geolocated using a remotely sensed
image (Fig 2).
Between December 15, 2014 and January 14, 2015, the Kono DERC reported 34 cases of
EVD in Sukudu (16 confirmed cases, 12 probable cases, and 6 survivors). Probable cases were
defined as any deceasedsuspected case having an epidemiologicallink with a confirmed case.
We recruited healthy children and adults age 4 and older who had been placed under quar-
antine during the period of active Ebola transmission in Sukudu. None of these individuals had
participated in an Ebola vaccine trial. Each potential participant was screened for fever or
symptoms consistent with EVD, and he/she was excluded if any were present. Medical referral
to a nearby Partners In Health-supported clinic (which provides free medical care to those
unable to pay) was provided.
Of 193 individuals from Sukudu who were quarantined for sharing a public latrine or living
quarters with a confirmed case, only 4 declined to participate. Ten individuals were initially
excluded because of fever at the time of initial contact; none of these met the case definition for
EVD. On reassessment one week later, all but one had defervescedand were able to provide
blood samples. Two participants had failed venipuncture attempts for blood draw. We thus
sampled a total of 187 individuals for anti-GP in 24 of 25 previously quarantined houses as
defined above (the members of 1 quarantined household could not be located).

 Survey. We collected the following data from study participants: age, gender, occupation,
education level, whether or not they shared a room with a confirmed case of EVD, and whether
they had signs or symptoms consistent with EVD that were severe enough to prompt seeking
of care during the time of their village outbreak. Specifically, these included fever or unex-
plained bleeding or any three of the following: headache, myalgia, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, hic-
cups, breathing problems, or difficulty swallowing [13]. Other household members verified
signs and symptoms.
Table 1 shows that 57.8% of participants were male, 35.8% were less than 15 years of age,
48.6% worked outside the home (mostly as farmers or miners), and 79.1% had completed pri-
mary school or less. Among exposed participants who were quarantined, 50.2% shared a public
latrine with a confirmed case, and 49.8% slept in the house of a confirmed case.
Laboratory analyses. Of the 187 exposed individuals tested, none of whom were previously
known to have EVD, we identified 14 (7.5%) who tested positive by anti-GP ELISA (Fig 3).
Two (14.3%) of these 14 reported fever during quarantine while the remaining 12 denied any
signs or symptoms during quarantine.
Data analyses. We considered participants to have had minimally symptomatic EBOV
infection if they 1) had an anti-GP ELISA above the cut-off as determined in the validation
sub-study and 2) denied symptoms consistent with EVD during the period of active transmis-
sion in the village.
In addition to the 16 confirmed EBOV infections with a fatal outcome, the 12 probable
deaths from EVD, and 6 confirmed EBOV infections who survived (34 total cases), our sero-
survey identified an additional 14 individuals who were anti-GP ELISA IgG-positive. Two of
these individuals reported fever during the quarantine period, and 12 were classified as mini-
mally symptomatic, contributing 25% (binomial exact 95% CI, 14% to 40%) to the total case-
load. After including the 2 undocumented symptomatic cases with the 34 reported by the
DERC, we calculated a 78% symptomatic case fatality ratio (binomial exact 95% CI, 61% to
90%).
Discussion
One year after the peak of the Ebola epidemic in Sierra Leone, we identified positive IgG
responses to Zaire-EBOV in 14 individuals not known to have had EBOV infection from a

 village classified as a hotspot for Ebola transmission. Of these, the majority reported having
had no symptoms consistent with EVD during the epidemic while two reported only fever.
Thus, we provide further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a
spectrumof clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. In addition,
our data suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone unde-
tected during the epidemic.
Although it was difficult to verify symptoms through our retrospective interviews (given the
considerable denial of EVD during the outbreak due to stigma and the fear of being admitted
to an ETU where those admitted were seldom discharged), our data indicate that 25% of
EBOV infections may have been minimally symptomatic, which is similar to the data from
empiric studies and to recent modeled estimates [14].
The phenomenon of previously undetected, minimally symptomatic EBOV infection was
evident around the discovery of the virus in 1976. Using an immunofluorescence assay, the
World Health Organization/International Study Team found that 19% of contacts of EVD
cases—veryfew of whom gave any history of illness—had antibodies to the virus [15]. In 2000,
Leroy and colleagues published a study (based on ELISA/Western blot) and found that of 24
asymptomatic close contacts of Gabonese patients with EVD, 11 developed both IgM and IgG
responses to Ebola Zaire antigens, indicating viral infection [16]. Other investigators have
found evidence of seropositive individuals in areas without large outbreaks using ELISA and
postulate that there may have been active circulation of filovirus without apparent clinical
manifestations [17,18]. Heffernan and colleagues also used ELISA in Gabon and found that 1%
of individuals in an epidemic zone had IgG antibodies to Ebola Zaire virus, yet no history of
exposure [19]. In another study in Gabon, Becquart and colleagues found a 15.3% Ebola Zaire
IgG seroprevalence in 220 randomly selected villages and concluded that most of the seroposi-
tive persons identified “probably had mild or asymptomatic infection” [20]; however, they
used uninfected individuals in France as negative controls. We found that unexposed expatri-
ates (not included as negative controls) had a significantly lower mean log anti-GP (M = 5.25
U/mL, SD = 0.54, N = 12) than unexposed Sierra Leoneans (M = 6.40 U/mL, SD = 1.06,
N = 132) using the two-sample t-test for unequal variances, t(20.05) = 6.40, P< = 0.001 (see
Fig 3. log (anti-GP) for 187 study participants, 132 negative controls, 30 positive controls, and 12
negative expatriates. The red line represents a cutoff of 4.7 U/mL [log (4700 U/μl) = 8.46], which yielded
96.7% sensitivity and 97.7% specificity in distinguishing controls.

 Fig 3), potentially due to cross-reactivity of our assay with closely related pathogens circulating
in the region.
Our study has several possible limitations. First, if asymptomatic EBOV infection is a com-
mon occurrence,it is possible that some of the “true negatives” used for the validation of our
ELISA assays could have been infected with EBOV. We did not use a microneutralization assay
for comparison purposes, nor did our pool of EVD survivors represent all of the possible anti-
body titers in the regional population. Although the serologic assay conferred sensitivity and
specificity greater than 95%, the assay protocol produced antibody titers that were considered
qualitative in nature. Second, we relied on study participants and their household contacts’
memories of events that had taken place up to a year prior when we classified them as symp-
tomatic or asymptomatic (potential recall bias); however, during the outbreak, most quaran-
tined households were monitored daily by surveillanceteams that conducted symptom screens
and measured temperatures, and individuals were brought to treatment facilities for EBOV
testing if they screened positive. Third, our IgG assays indicate previous infection but provide
no information on when that infection took place. The 3 negative controls with positive tests
either represent false positives due to cross-reactive antibodies or previously infected individu-
als. (We did not perform IgM ELISAs, as other investigators have demonstrated that Ebola
IgM titers largely diminish within 60 to 90 days of symptom onset [21,22].) Fourth, we did not
ascertain whether there were non-quarantined individuals who had minimally symptomatic
infection.
Our study focused on the quarantined population of one village. Extrapolation of our find-
ings to other villages and generalizability to the epidemic should be approached with caution.
Although many of the study participants were followed by surveillanceteams during the time
of active EBOV transmission in their village, the timing of the possible infection cannot be
known from IgG data, and it is improbable that surveillanceteams followed each individual
throughout the duration of the outbreak in Sierra Leone. Thus, the concern that IgG positive
persons indeed had but denied symptoms cannot be excluded.
Despite these limitations, our serosurveyprovides a deeper perspective on EBOV transmis-
sion, and more village-level serosurveyscould enhance our understanding of undetected
EBOV transmission at the epidemic level. Furthermore, our findings suggest there would be
value in exploring the interaction of seropositive persons and EVD cases to improve our under-
standing of exposure risk. As a result, we may learn more about how efforts at containment can
be improved. The data also have important implications for future vaccine studies that rely on
detecting antibody to EBOV. Lastly, the findings support the World Health Organization’s
interim guidance on clinical care for survivors of EVD, which defines a survivor as a person:
• With a confirmed positive result on RT-PCR testing for EBOV on any body fluid who subse-
quently recovered;
And/or
• Who is IgM and/or IgG positive on serological testing for EVD and has not been vaccinated
against EBOV [23].
There is ongoing discussion in West Africa over the definition of survivorship, usually spec-
ified by having a positive EBOV RT-PCR result and discharge from an ETU. Plans are under-
way to develop national registries and provide ID cards to such survivors, so as to delineate
individuals eligible for free social and medical support services.Should the notion of survivor-
ship be extended to all those who are IgG positive, including those who had minimally symp-
tomatic infection or who were sick but were never tested at the time of illness? How we define a

 community of suffering is always problematic and should be revisited given that this definition
has implications for identity, stigma, and access to social and medical services.
In conclusion, by using ELISA to measure Zaire-EBOV antibody concentrations, we identi-
fied a significant number of individuals with previously undetected minimally symptomatic
EBOV infection in a ‘hotspot’ village in Sierra Leone, approximately one year after the village
outbreak. Further studies are needed to understand the potential risk of transmission and clini-
cal sequelae in individuals with minimally symptomatic EBOV infection.
