Introduction: A previous study found that the Food and Drug Administration’s The Real Cost
national tobacco education campaign was associated with preventing approximately 350,000 U.S.
youth from initiating smoking between 2014 and 2016. This study translates the reduction in smok-
ing initiation into monetary terms by examining the cost effectiveness of the campaign.
Methods: The cost effectiveness of The Real Cost was assessed by measuring efficiency in two
ways: (1) estimating the cost per quality-adjusted life year saved and (2) estimating the total mone-
tary return on investment by comparing the cost savings associated with the campaign to campaign
expenditures. Analyses were conducted in 2017.
Results: The Real Cost averted an estimated 175,941 youth from becoming established smokers
between 2014 and 2016. Campaign expenditures totaled $246,915,233. The cost per quality-
adjusted life year saved of the campaign was $1,337. When considering the costs of smoking, the
averted established smokers represent >$31 billion in cost savings ($1.3 billion when only external
costs considered). The overall return on investment of the campaign was $128 in cost savings for
every $1 spent ($4 for every $1 spent when only external costs considered). These conclusions were
robust to sensitivity analyses surrounding the parameters.
Conclusions: Campaign expenditures were cost efficient. The cost savings resulting from The Real
Cost represent a large reduction in the financial burden to individuals, their families, and society as
a result of tobacco. Public health campaigns, like The Real Cost, that reduce tobacco-related mor-
bidity and mortality for a generation of U.S. youth also provide substantial cost savings.

TAGEDH1INTRODUCTIONTAGEDEND
P
rior research has shown that mass media cam-
paigns to reduce tobacco use can promote cessa-
tion and decrease initiation among youth.1,2
Several economic evaluations of media campaigns have
found tobacco-focused mass media campaigns to be cost
effective.3�6 Given a changing environment (e.g., declin-
ing smoking rates, rise of social media, and changes in
accessing media), campaigns may differ in effectiveness
and costs. It is increasingly important that federal funds
to improve public health are cost effective, and guide-
lines have set an acceptable threshold for costs savings
related to health interventions aimed to reduce mortality
and morbidity.7�9 Assessing the cost utility and return
on investment (ROI) of public health expenditures
allows stakeholders and policy makers to determine
whether the economic investment in the campaign can
be justified by the public health outcomes and provides
insight into the potential cost savings of these outcomes.

 Since February 2014, the Food and Drug Administra-
tion has conducted a national tobacco public education
campaign designed to prevent the initiation of cigarette
smoking among youth aged 12 to 17 years who have
never smoked but are susceptible to smoking (suscepti-
ble nonsmokers) and to discourage further smoking
among youth who have experimented with smoking in
the past (experimenters). The Real Cost has appeared on
national TV, radio, the Internet, and out-of-home dis-
plays, as well as in magazines and movie theaters. The
central theme of the campaign is: “Every cigarette costs
you something.” In the first 3 years of advertising, cam-
paign themes focused on the cosmetic effects of smok-
ing, loss of control caused by addiction, and the
dangerous mix of toxic chemicals in cigarette smoke.
A nationally representative longitudinal study of U.S.
youth examined campaign awareness levels and evalu-
ated the effect of The Real Cost on smoking-related
beliefs and behaviors. After 8 months of advertising,
more than 90% of the campaign’s target audience (sus-
ceptible nonsmokers and experimenters) reported ad
awareness, and most surveyed youth considered adver-
tisements to be effective based on assessments of per-
ceived
effectiveness.10
After
14
months
on
air,
agreement with the eight campaign-targeted beliefs
increased 11.5% from baseline measurement, and cam-
paign exposure was associated with increased odds of
agreeing with campaign-targeted beliefs.11
In January 2017, Farrelly et al.12 published the results
of a model examining the effect of campaign exposure
on smoking initiation. Among youth who reported never
having smoked a cigarette in the baseline survey, high
campaign exposure was associated with a 30% decrease
in the risk for smoking initiation (AOR=0.70, 95%
CI=0.55, 0.91). Exposure to The Real Cost was associated
with preventing an estimated 348,398 U.S. youth aged 11
to 18 years from initiating smoking during February
2014�March 2016 (95% CI=331,825, 365,168).
This study assesses the cost effectiveness of The Real
Cost by measuring efficiency in two ways: (1) examining
the cost utility of the campaign by estimating the cost
per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) saved and (2)
examining the total ROI for the campaign. Both meth-
ods are based on the results of the smoking initiation
model.12 The QALY framework is one of several stan-
dard approaches that have been used to calculate the
cost
effectiveness
of
similar
public
health
inter-
ventions3�5,13 and assists in comparing The Real Cost
with other health interventions. In addition, the cost sav-
ings, or benefits, associated with The Real Cost are quan-
tified using methodology from Sloan and colleagues14
and compared with campaign costs to calculate the ROI
for the campaign.
TAGEDH1METHODSTAGEDEND
Study Sample
The cost per QALY saved was estimated from a campaign per-
spective using the following key parameters: campaign costs, esti-
mated number of smokers averted between 2014 and 2016 as a
result of the campaign, and number of QALYs saved per pre-
vented smoker. This methodology is comparable to previous stud-
ies on cost utility for youth prevention.3,13
The ROI analysis used three key parameters: campaign costs,
estimated number of smokers averted, and cost savings per
averted smoker. The cost savings were calculated using the frame-
work documented in The Price of Smoking14 to estimate a compre-
hensive measure of the smoking-related costs averted as a result of
the reduction in smoking initiation. The ROI analysis compares
the benefits, or cost savings, of the campaign with the costs associ-
ated with its implementation. This method estimates the dollar
value of the campaign’s benefits for each dollar spent.
Campaign costs and resulting outcomes for the two analyses
are compared with what would have happened in the absence of
the campaign. Univariate sensitivity analyses were conducted for
individual parameters for both cost per QALY and ROI analyses
to account for the impact of uncertainty on the conclusions of
each analysis. All analyses were conducted in 2017.
Measures
Table 1 presents the costs associated with implementing The Real
Cost.a These costs include the media contract for planning and
development, media purchase, partnerships, outreach, and adminis-
tration. The cost of the contract awarded to RTI International to
evaluate the campaign was also included. No costs were included for
campaign exposure, as viewing advertisements introduced no addi-
tional time burden beyond one’s usual media viewing habits.
Campaign costs were aggregated over time to generate gross imple-
mentation costs for the study period. Costs for 2016 reflect partial
costs for the year (January�March) to reflect the timing of the
study.
The first estimate established was the number of averted estab-
lished adult smokers attributable to The Real Cost. The starting
value for this estimate was the number of youth averted from ini-
tiating smoking, based on the estimate from Farrelly et al.12
(N=348,398, 95% CI=331,825, 365,168). Not all those who initiate
smoking as an adolescent go on to become established smokers.
Gruber and Zinman,15 using National Health Interview Survey
data, found that about 50.5% of youth who try smoking between
the ages 12 and 17 years will become established smokers when
aged �28 years. This estimate most closely reflects the age range
for the analyses. Thus, the number of averted established adult
smokers is 175,941 (348,398 £ 0.505).
Quantifiable metrics of an intervention’s health outcomes are LYs
and QALYs saved. QALYs account for the morbidity and mortality
of health outcomes. Here, they represent a combined measure of
quantity of LYs lost and quality-of-life losses resulting from smok-
ing-related illnesses. To estimate the LYs and QALYs saved, research
by Wang and colleagues13 was used. Wang and colleagues estimated
LYs lost for three smoker types (former smokers, light smokers, and
heavy smokers) using National Health Interview Survey�adjusted

Tobacco Products.

 life tables for smokers aged 25 to 29 years.16 The life expectancy for a
never smoker is 2 years longer than a former smoker, 3.5 years lon-
ger than a light smoker, and 14.2 years longer than a heavy smoker.
Future LYs lost were discounted to their present value using a 3%
annual discount rate17 and weighted to account for the relative pro-
portion of each smoker type for individuals aged 25 to 29 years. The
study also found that the weighted average of discounted LYs saved
for each smoker was 0.67 and report an estimate of 1.05 QALYs
saved per smoker (1 LY=1.57 QALYS, 1.57 £ 0.67=1.05 QALYs
saved per smoker). The conversion value for LYs to QALYs for
smokers aged 25 to 29 years was derived by Wang and colleagues
using published data from Cromwell et al.18 The values of 0.67 LYs
and 1.05 QALYs saved per smoker were the final values used in the
cost per QALY analysis.
The total cost savings per smoker are a combination of (1) pri-
vate, (2) quasi-external, and (3) external costs. The private costs
of smoking are the costs incurred directly by the smoker. The
quasi-external costs reflect the costs to an average smoker’s spouse
or children because of secondhand smoke. The external costs of
smoking include the costs not borne by the smoker or their family
and instead incurred by society. Together, these direct and indi-
rect costs represent the cost burden of smoking to society. The
costs were rigorously calculated by Sloan and colleagues14 using a
life-cycle or longitudinal approach. This approach is particularly
well suited to this analysis as it documents all costs accrued over
an average smoker’s lifetime and addresses the question, “If we
could influence a person not to smoke, what would be the savings
over the individual’s lifetime?”14,19
To calculate the present-day value of all costs, the estimates
from Sloan and colleagues were adapted to this study by applying
a 3% discount rate to further discount values to the average age of
prevented smokers. Because the costs occur in the future, their
present-day value is lower for an individual aged 15.5 years than
for an individual aged 24 years. Additionally, the values were
updated to 2016 dollars using the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
medical component for medical costs and the CPI less medical
care for other cost categories, in keeping with similar research.20
TAGEDH1RESULTSTAGEDEND
Table 2 presents results from the cost�utility analysis.
Campaign costs between 2013 and March 2016 totaled
$246,915,233 (Table 1). From the estimated number of
youth prevented from initiating smoking (n=348,398)
and the corresponding adjustment of the likelihood of
being an established smoker at age �28 years (50.5%),
the campaign resulted in an estimated 175,941 fewer
established smokers (0.505 £ 348,398) aged �28 years
(95% CI=167,572, 184,410). Using the values of 0.67 LYs
lost per smoker and 1.05 QALYs lost per smoker, the

 estimates for costs per LY saved and QALY saved were
$2,095 and $1,337, respectively. Sensitivity analyses were
conducted around the cost per QALY analysis parame-
ters and main findings were robust to variation in these
parameters (Appendix A, available online).
Table 3 summarizes the adapted values for each cost
type incurred by an average smoker; the private costs,
quasi-external costs, and external costs. The last column
in Table 3 represents the total costs of smoking. These
values account for the increase in CPI between year
2000 U.S. dollars and year 2016 U.S. dollars using a mul-
tiplier of 1.777 for the medical care cost CPI and 1.359
for the CPI less medical care costs. The net present value
for a smoker aged 15.5 years (the mean age of averted
smokers) was estimated by multiplying each value by
0.777 (calculated from: 1/[1.03]8.5) to adjust for the
8.5 years of additional discounting from the original val-
ues for an individual aged 24 years. The next sections
provide an overview of calculations for the three cost
components (Table 3; for more detail on each cost, see
Sloan and colleagues14).
The present value of the private costs to a smoker
aged 15.5 years in 2016 is $149,573. The private costs
include the present-day value of all future expendi-
tures on cigarettes over the course of the smoker’s
life14,23 (Table 3). Their sum is the total present-day
value
of
a
smoker’s
expenditures
on
cigarettes,
>$14,000
in
2016
dollars.
This
figure
does
not
account for additional cigarettes smoked between the
ages of 15.5 and 24 years.
The largest private costs of smoking are the smoker’s
mortality and disability. The WHO recommends that
the premature death and loss of LYs should be valued
when considering the economic impact of smoking.19
The mortality costs are based on a value of $100,000 per
LY, the lowest of three LY values typically employed in
valuations of LYs saved.17 The private medical care costs
are the present-day value of the increase in out-of-pocket
insurance payments and taxes funding public insurance
programs, such as Medicaid.
The other private costs accounted for include the
reduction in Social Security taxable earnings and the
reduction in Social Security and defined benefit pension
contributions.
The quasi-external costs reflect the costs to an average
smoker’s spouse or children because of secondhand

costs of smoking can be calculated using alternate values for a LY or excluding the monetary costs of mortality. Changing this value will yield higher
or lower values for the costs of smoking accordingly.

 smoke. These values account for increased morbidity
and mortality of a spouse, infant deaths, and medical
expenditures resulting from secondhand smoke. The
costs also account for a reduction in private pension pay-
outs and Social Security that result from the increased
mortality for the smoker’s spouse. The present-day value
of the quasi-external costs of a smoker aged 15.5 years is
$24,848 in 2016 U.S. dollars.
The external costs of smoking are the smallest of
the three types of smoking costs and represent the
costs not borne by the smoker or their family. The
main costs are increases in medical care costs borne
by nonsmokers, productivity losses and losses because
of sick leave, a loss of taxes as a result of lower Social
Security taxable income, and an increase in life insur-
ance payments not fully subsidized by a smoker’s life
insurance premiums. These costs are partially offset
by reductions in the payouts or outlays to smokers
for Social Security and defined benefit pensions. The
increase in taxes negates the payment of taxes by
smokers and results in a net neutral amount for the
total tax costs. The present-day value of the external
costs of a smoker aged 15.5 years is $7,228 in
2016 U.S. dollars.
The aggregate costs for each smoker total $181,649.
Every adolescent aged 15.5 years averted from smoking
in 2016 represents >$180,000 in present-value costs
savings.
To quantify the ROI, the total present-day value for
the
cost
per
smoker
documented
in
Table
3,
$181,649.34, was multiplied by the number of averted
established smokers (n=175,941). The total value repre-
sents >$31 billion in cost savings ($31,959,566,529)
attributable to The Real Cost (Table 4). When consi-
dering only external costs, the total cost savings are
$1.4 billion.
Table 4 presents the ROI, calculated by dividing the
costs saved (net costs of the campaign) by the costs of
implementing the campaign, $246,915,233. Every $1
spent on The Real Cost resulted in a present-day cost
savings of $128. When considering external costs only,
every $1 spent resulted in a cost savings of $4. Sensi-
tivity analyses were conducted around the parameters
for the ROI analyses (Appendix A, available online).
Even when considering external costs only, the num-
ber of prevented smokers would need to be <10% of
the original estimate before the campaign no longer
had a positive ROI.
TAGEDH1DISCUSSIONTAGEDEND
The cost per QALY saved for The Real Cost, $1,337, is
consistent with a similar study on the cost utility of a
public education campaign to prevent youth cigarette
initiation.3 Holtgrave et al.3 estimated a similar cost per
QALY saved $1,818 for the truth campaign from the
campaign perspective ($2,425 in 2016 dollars). Other
campaigns targeting adult tobacco cessation found a cost
per QALY saved of $2684 and $37,355.5,b Comparisons
should be interpreted with caution because of differing
methodologies in the analyses and differing populations
for each campaign. The Real Cost is well under the
$50,000 to $109,000 threshold range for the cost per
QALY recommended value in the U.S.7�9 Preventing an
adolescent aged 15.5 years from smoking was estimated
to save more than $180,000 per smoker. The averted
smokers attributable to the campaign result in an overall
ROI of $128 for every $1 spent. Some previous studies
have estimated the costs of smoking for external costs
only.24 When considering external costs only, the cam-
paign was still cost saving and the ROI was $4 for every
$1 spent. Although these findings apply to the U.S., they
compare favorably with a systematic review of ROIs for
public health interventions in high-income countries,
where the median ROI for national public health inter-
ventions was 27.2 to 1.25
Limitations
The analyses are subject to a number of limitations. First,
the number of youth prevented from initiating smoking
is subject to estimation error due to any limitations or
uncertainty of the associated model.12 Second, although
QALYs saved and LYs saved values are consistent with

 previous research, they are based on dated life tables. If
the relationship between smoking and longevity has
changed since these life tables were estimated, the results
could change. Third, the costs of smoking are from Sloan
and colleagues14 and share limitations documented in
that study. In adapting the costs for this study, there are
additional limitations. The first is specific to the cost cal-
culations associated with smokers aged 15.5 to 24 years.
The analysis does not account for any costs of smoking
for this age range, which would increase the private costs
of smoking. The analysis also potentially undercounts
smokers’ earnings, lost income taxes on earnings, and
work loss because of sick days or other productivity
losses. These are minor omissions overall, but would
nonetheless result in larger cost savings attributable to
the campaign. In addition, the data used to estimate pro-
gression from initiation to established smoking are from
1992 and 1995, respectively.15 The authors know of no
extant literature that indicates how smoking progression
may have changed in recent years as a result of recent
declines in smoking prevalence. If fewer youth try a ciga-
rette but those who experiment are more likely to
become established smokers, the estimates understate
the cost savings of the campaign and overstate the cost
per QALY saved. Alternately, if the decline in prevalence
means that youth are less likely to become established
smokers even after experimentation, the numbers may
overstate the cost savings and understate the cost per
QALY saved for the campaign.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to account for the
potential uncertainty around the estimates (Appendix A,
available online). The results showed that these conclu-
sions are robust to variations in the estimated number of
smokers averted. If the number of smokers averted as
estimated in Farrelly et al.12 was lower than 348,398, or
if the percentage of youth who become established
smokers is lower than 50.5%, the campaign would still
meet the recommended QALY cost threshold and result
in a smaller but positive ROI. The results also showed
the conclusions are robust to the changes in the QALY
per averted smokers. This analysis used a conservative
cost per QALY saved estimate compared with others in
the literature; using an unpublished value estimated
from more recent data resulted in a cost per QALY saved
of $404 (compared with $1,337).
TAGEDH1CONCLUSIONSTAGEDEND
The cost effectiveness of The Real Cost has several pol-
icy implications. The resulting cost savings for the
reduction in youth smoking amounts to more than $31
billion. This value represents a large reduction in the
financial burden to individuals, their families, and
society as a result of tobacco use. These findings indi-
cate that expenditures on the campaign were cost sav-
ing and efficient, and that these results are robust to
variations in the analysis specifications. The cost per
QALY saved for this campaign, which is in line with
the cost-saving calculations of past tobacco-related
mass media efforts, is also in keeping with the cost per
QALY saved for other major prevention interventions.c
Public health campaigns like The Real Cost reduce the
burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality for
a generation of U.S. youth. The findings suggest that
these interventions not only markedly improve public
health outcomes, but they also provide substantial cost
savings.
