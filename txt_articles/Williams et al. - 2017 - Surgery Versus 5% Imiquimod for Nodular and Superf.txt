ABSTRACT
Background: We previously reported modest clinical 3-year benefit for topical imiquimod
compared with surgery for superficial or nodular basal cell carcinoma (sBCC, nBCC) at low
risk sites in our non-inferiority randomised controlled SINS trial. Here we report 5-year data.
Methods: Participants were randomised to imiquimod 5% cream once daily (sBCC, 6 weeks;
nBCC, 12 weeks) or excisional surgery (4 mm margin). Primary outcome was clinical absence
of initial failure or signs of recurrence at 3 year dermatology review. Five year success was
defined as 3 year success plus absence of recurrences identified through hospital,
histopathology and general practitioner records.
Results: Of 501 participants randomised, 401 contributed to the modified intention-to-treat
analyses at year 3 (primary outcome), 383 (96%) of whom had data at year 5. Five year success
rates for imiquimod were 82·5% (170/206) compared to 97·7% (173/177) for surgery (relative
risk of imiquimod success 0·84, 95% CI 0·77 to 0·91, p<0.001). These were comparable to
year 3 success rates of 83·6% (178/213) and 98.4% (185/188), for imiquimod and surgery,
respectively. Most imiquimod treatment failures occurred in year one.
Interpretation: Although surgery is clearly superior to imiquimod, this study shows sustained
benefit for lesions that respond early to topical imiquimod.

INTRODUCTION
Basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) are the commonest form of human cancer with an estimated 1
million cases diagnosed each year in the US (Prieto-Granada and Rodriguez-Waitkus, 2015).
The incidence of BCC is rising by around 10% each year (Karagas and Greenberg, 1995) in
white populations such as those living in Australia (Perera et al., 2015), yet poor registration
of BCC makes it difficult to compare estimates across the world (Hay et al., 2014). A range
of genetic factors have been associated with BCC and recurrent BCC (Madan et al., 2010),
but unlike cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, the relationship between sun exposure
patterns and different types of BCC is still unclear. Although deaths from BCC are rare
(Boyers et al., 2014), considerable morbidity may result due to the local aggressive nature of
BCC and BCC recurrences (Hollestein et al., 2014). Trends in ageing populations means that
supply of appropriate treatment such as excisional surgery may be stretched in State
healthcare systems such as the UK National Health Service, and it has been estimated that the
number of cases presenting to dermatologists will increase by 50% by 2030 (Madan et al.,
2010). Such a trend has resulted in guidance for more family practitioners to provide
treatment for low risk lesions in the community (Fremlin et al., 2016). Although excisional
surgery remains the gold standard for most common types of BCC, a range of non-surgical
approaches are available including photodynamic therapy (Wang et al., 2015), topical
imiquimod cream, topical 5-fluorouracil, and topical ingenol (Clark et al., 2014). We
previously published the 3 year results of an independent comparison of topical imiquimod
versus excisional surgery for the treatment of low risk superficial and nodular BCC in the
SINS trial (Bath-Hextall et al., 2014). Although the topical imiquimod response rate of 84%,
compared with 98% for surgery, failed to meet our pre-defined non-inferiority margin of a
relative risk of 0.87, it nevertheless offered a potentially useful treatment option that may be
suitable for first treatment of low risk BCC in the community, with recurrences being dealt
 4
with by specialists through more sophisticated treatments such as excisional surgery or Mohs
micrographic surgery . One major concern with non-surgical topical treatments is that the
visible superficial portions of a BCC may appear to clear on early clinical inspection, only for
invasive BCC to emerge some years after treatment. We previously called this phenomenon
“submarine lesions” (Williams HC, 2014). There are additional concerns that some forms of
topical chemotherapy such as 5-fluorouracil, may alter the biological behaviour of BCC from
a simple to a more difficult to treat lesion such as a morphoeic BCC (Xiong et al., 2014). For
these reasons, it is important to follow up BCC trial participants for at least 5 years. Here, we
report the 5 year follow-up of the SINS study participants using histopathology and
healthcare records.
 5
RESULTS
Participants were recruited between June 19, 2003, and February 22, 2007, with 3 year
follow-up in clinic from June 26, 2006, to May 26, 2010, and 5 year follow-up of hospital,
GP and histopathology records completed in 2012. Participant characteristics have been
published in the previous 3 year data report (Bath-Hextall et al., 2014). Participant flow from
randomisation to 5 years is shown in the figure. A total of 18 patients did not have usable
data at year 5. In the imiquimod group, three had died and we could not determine if
recurrence had occurred in four (three not sure from records and one visit not done). In the
surgery group, six had died and we could not determine if recurrence had occurred in five
(three not sure, one visit done too early and one not done).
Recurrences recorded at 5 years compared with 3 years are shown in the table, broken down
into early treatment failures and later recurrences as recommended in previous
correspondence to our article (Bassukas and Gaitanis, 2014). Additional recurrences between
3 and 5 years were small with one additional recurrence for a superficial BCC treated with
imiquimod and one for surgery. Histological subtype was unknown for the one recurrence on
topical imiquimod (patient was treated with cryotherapy) and was recorded as superficial
basal cell carcinoma for the one recurrence on surgery.

DISCUSSION
The 5 year follow-up data from the SINS study do not suggest a progressive rise in BCC
recurrences between years 3 to 5, nor do they suggest that recurrences in the imiquimod
group were difficult to spot, or that they had transformed from superficial to morphoeic forms
as is the concern with some other topical treatments such as PDT (Bernabo et al., 2016;
Xiong et al., 2014). Most treatment failures with topical imiquimod occurred in the first year
of treatment, a finding that throws light on the possible mechanisms of topical
immunotherapy for skin cancer - suggesting that once an immunological response has
occurred, such a response is sustained. The new data presented in this report do not lend any
support to concerns of “submarine” lesions emerging on the skin surface years after early
apparent clinical benefit of topical treatment. The absolute response rate for topical
imiquimod of 83% at 5 years, whilst clearly inferior to the 98% for excisional surgery for low
risk BCC, might still represent a clinically useful treatment modality since a cream treatment
can be carried out in a primary care setting and some patients may also prefer the option of a
cream rather than surgery.
Clark et al. (2014) summarise 29 RCTs and 7 systematic reviews of comparative
effectiveness of treatments for BCC published up to August 2013 from four databases and
cite photodynamic therapy (PDT), topical imiquimod, cryotherapy and topical 5-fluorouracil
as suitable treatment options for primary low-risk lesions. They found insufficient evidence
to make recommendations on the use of topical ingenol mebutate, solasodine glycoalkaloids,
IFN-α or intralesional 5-fluorouracil, and no RCT evidence on electrodessication and 
curettage, which is a commonly used procedure for low risk BCC. Wang et al. (2015) in their
systematic review of RCTs of PDT for BCC published up to October 2013 found eight
studies, two of which included a comparison with surgical excision with 5 year follow up
 7
data. The first of these was an RCT by Rhodes et al. (2007) that compared topical methyl
aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy versus simple excision surgery for primary nodular
BCC in 97 patients. They estimated a sustained lesion complete response rate of 76% (95%
CI, 59%-87%) and 96% (95% CI, 84%-99%) for PDT and surgery respectively at 5 years.
Inspection of the time to event analysis in that study showed a steady increase in recurrences
throughout the 5 year follow-up, rather than a pattern of early treatment failures and low
recurrences thereafter as seen for topical imiquimod in this SINS study. The other RCT that
evaluated fractionated 20% 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-PDT with prior partial debulking
versus surgical excision in nodular BCC in 151 patients with nodular BCC (Roozeboom et
al., 2013), showed a cumulative probability of recurrence of 30·7% (95% CI 21·5%-42·6%)
for ALA-PDT and 2.3% (95% CI 0·6%-8·8%) for surgical excision, but with much lower
rates of recurrence for tumours ≤ 0·7 mm thick. Their Kaplan-Meir plot suggested a steeper 
slope for recurrences over years 1 to 3. Another systematic review of interventions for
superficial BCC in 2012 found pooled estimates from 23 randomized and non-randomized
studies of 87·3% for imiquimod (95% CI 84–91%) and 84·0% for PDT (95% CI 78–90%)
(Roozeboom et al., 2012). A subsequently published non-inferiority RCT performed a head
to head comparison between topical 5-FU, topical 5% imiquimod and methyl
aminolevulinate-photodynamic therapy (MAL-PDT) in 601 patients with superficial BCC,
followed up for 1 and 3 years (Arits et al., 2013; Roozeboom et al., 2016). They found that
tumor-free survival at 3 years post-treatment was 58.0% for MAL-PDT (95% confidence
interval [CI] = 47.8-66.9), 68.2% for topical fluorouracil (95% CI = 58.1-76.3) and 79.7%
for imiquimod (95% CI = 71.6-85.7), with clear evidence that topical imiquimod was
superior to MAL-PDT (treatment failure hazard ratio for imiquimod compared with MAL-
PDT was 0.50, 95% CI = 0.33-0.76, P = 0.001). Tumour thickness does not seem to predict
treatment failure for topical imiquimod, PDT or topical 5-fluorouracil (Roozeboom et al.,
 8
2015). We have been unable to identify any further trials comparing topical imiquimod
versus other active therapies for the treatment of low risk nodular or superficial BCC, and
none with 5 years follow-up. A review has shown that radiotherapy also offers comparable
cure rates (Cho et al, 2014) and good cosmetic outcomes, but only two RCTs were included
in that review.
Strengths of this study include the large size and pragmatic design that included a wide range
of patients who might be considered for such treatment in primary care. Observer bias is
unlikely given that 5 year results were collected from a range of routine sources in which a
vested interest in the direction of the results would be unlikely. Analysis at 5 years used an
intention to treat approach and losses to follow up between years 3 to 5 were relatively small.
Study limitations include the fact that we used imiquimod 7 days a week, rather than the
current licensed 5 days a week. Recurrences at 5 years were identified by checks on notes and
histopathology records rather than direct clinical examination of participants, so it is possible
that some less noticeable recurrences might have been missed, especially as follow-up
between 3 to 5 years following treatment is likely to have been done in the community by
general practitioners who may be less skilled in identifying possible recurrences. On the other
hand, it is possible that patients and their doctors might have demonstrated increased
vigilance in looking out for recurrences given that so much attention was paid to the “study
lesion” for the first 3 years of the study, and given that topical imiquimod was a “new”
treatment at the time of the study. Furthermore, such potential missed recurrences are likely
to be similar for both treatment groups. Some of the surgeons delivering care in the SINS
study were trained in advanced surgery and therefore not typical of secondary care or primary
care. In terms of external validity, it is possible that the study favoured slightly younger
people with BCC who were more mobile than some of the older and more frail patients who
 9
declined to participate, and it is also possible that those entering the study were motivated
about the prospect of getting topical imiquimod which was not licensed for BCC at the start
of the study.
Although the SINS study has shown that 3 and 5 year results for topical imiquimod for low
risk superficial and nodular BCC are clearly inferior to excisional surgery, the overall success
rate of 82·5% at 5 years still represents a useful clinical response, especially as most
treatment failures are identified early and long-term responses seem to be maintained.
Application site reactions, reported in more detail in the 3 year analysis included itching and
weeping, were rarely severe enough to withdraw from treatment. Recurrences of low risk
BCC treated with topical imiquimod did not appear to be difficult to treat. A possible future
strategy to deal with the epidemic of BCC might be to treat low risk BCC in the community
using imiquimod and to deal with recurrences surgically. Suitably informed patients could
make their own choice about the use of imiquimod and other non-surgical treatment
modalities. The SINS study now provides valuable data to inform such shared decision
making that might be delivered to patients by video-based educational materials (Love et al.,
2016).
Many people with BCC are elderly but as seen in this study only a small number had died
before the 5 year data was collected. Future comparative studies should include 5 year follow
up data, a surgical trial arm to allow standardised comparisons with other studies and a
presentation of overall data on early treatment failures and late recurrences (Bassukas and
Gaitanis, 2014).
 10
METHODS
These have been described in full in our previous publications (Bath-Hextall et al., 2014,
Ozolins et al., 2010). Briefly, the SINS study is a multi-centre, parallel group pragmatic non-
inferiority randomised trial to see if imiquimod is non-inferior to surgery. Eligible
participants had histologically confirmed primary, previously untreated, nodular or
superficial BCCs not occurring in sites at high risk for subclinical tumour spread which
include the nose, ear, eyelid, eyebrow, and temple. Those with morphoeic or recurrent BCCs
and patients with Gorlin syndrome were excluded. Participants were randomised to
imiquimod 5% cream once daily for 6 (superficial) or 12 (nodular) weeks, or surgical
excision with a 4 mm margin. Participants were initially recruited from three dermatology
secondary care centres, with an additional nine centres engaged to boost recruitment. Written
informed consent was provided by all participants. Those consented were allocated to
treatment group via remote randomisation by The Trent Research and Development Support
Unit using block randomisation and stratifying by centre and BCC type. The list was
concealed from investigators. Masking of participants was not possible due to the nature of
the interventions and masking of outcome assessors was only partially possible because of
surgical scars. The primary outcome previously reported was the proportion of participants
with clinical evidence of success, (defined as neither initial treatment failure nor signs of
local recurrence when reviewed at 3 years by consultant dermatologists). Secondary
outcomes included clinical success at 1, 2 and 5 years; time to first failure; cost effectiveness,
cosmetic appearance of lesion site assessed by participant and dermatologist assessor; pain
during treatment and in the 16 weeks follow up; and number of days participants experienced
moderate/severe pain during treatment and 16 week follow up. The full rationale for the
sample size is reported in the previous paper and study protocol (Bath-Hextall et al., 2014,
 11
Ozolins et al., 2010), but due to recruitment difficulties and following sample size
reassessment, recruitment was stopped at 501 participants. The non-inferiority margin based
on these figures is a relative risk of 0.87 (lower boundary of a 98% CI for the relative
difference in effect expressed as a relative risk), and only applies to the primary outcome.
Data were analysed using Stata version 13·1 according to the pre-specified analysis plan. A
modified intention-to-treat analysis was conducted on the full dataset (all randomised
participants with a histologically confirmed BCC lesion, who met the inclusion/exclusion
criteria, received at least one application of imiquimod or surgery and for whom the outcome
of interest was available) for all outcome measures, and a per-protocol analysis was also
conducted for the primary outcome at 3 years. All analyses were adjusted for centre, BCC type
(superficial or nodular), size and site of tumour, and immunosuppression at baseline. Poisson
regression with a robust error variance was used to estimate the treatment effect as a relative
risk. Treatment success at 5 years was defined as those achieving success at the primary
outcome assessment at 3 years plus absence of further recurrences at 5 years. Long term adverse
event data were not collected, but deaths were recorded. The 5 year BCC recurrence data for
those participants who were included in the 3 year primary outcome analysis were retrieved
from at least one and more often than not all of the following three sources: (i) hospital
histopathology records from each centre, follow-up of (ii) general practitioner and (iii) hospital
records. The only data that were recorded were whether the trial participant had a recurrence
of the BCC originally treated, with the date of recurrence, and if relevant the date and cause of
death. No additional data were recorded at 5 years, apart from explanatory notes, particularly
where evidence were not clear.
