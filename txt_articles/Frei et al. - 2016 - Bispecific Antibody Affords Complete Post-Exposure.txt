Complete Post-Exposure Protection 
of Mice from Both Ebola (Zaire) and 
Sudan Viruses

Filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) cause severe hemorrhagic fever. There are five species of ebolavirus; 
among these, the Ebola (Zaire) and Sudan viruses (EBOV and SUDV, respectively) are highly pathogenic 
and have both caused recurring, large outbreaks. However, the EBOV and SUDV glycoprotein (GP) 
sequences are 45% divergent and thus antigenically distinct. Few antibodies with cross-neutralizing 
properties have been described to date. We used antibody engineering to develop novel bispecific 
antibodies (Bis-mAbs) that are cross-reactive toward base epitopes on GP from EBOV and SUDV. These 
Bis-mAbs exhibit potent neutralization against EBOV and SUDV GP pseudotyped viruses as well as 
authentic pathogens, and confer a high degree (in one case 100%) post-exposure protection of mice 
from both viruses. Our studies show that a single agent that targets the GP base epitopes is sufficient 
for protection in mice; such agents could be included in panfilovirus therapeutic antibody cocktails.
The family Filoviridae (“filoviruses”) includes five species of ebolavirus and Marburg virus (MARV). Infection 
by these negative-stranded RNA viruses causes severe hemorrhagic fever with human case fatality rates as high 
as 90%1,2. Filovirus outbreaks are sporadic in nature and, prior to 2014, were limited to fewer than 500 cases3. 
However, the 2014 epidemic in West Africa, still on-going in some regions, is unprecedented in terms of total size 
(over 28,000 suspected cases as of this writing), geographic distribution, and longevity. The five species of ebola-
virus are named for the regions in which they were first identified: Zaire (EBOV), Sudan (SUDV), Bundibugyo 
(BDBV), Tai Forest (TAFV), and Reston (RESTV)2. The West Africa epidemic is caused by a novel isolate of 
EBOV (Makona)4–6. Based on the history of human outbreaks, there appears to be a broad distribution of path-
ogenicity and geographic location for EBOV, SUDV, and BDBV, the three species that have caused recurring, 
large outbreaks. EBOV and BDBV outbreaks have generally been associated with Central Africa, mostly in the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, and SUDV outbreaks with Uganda and South Sudan. The only previous case of 
any filovirus in West Africa, prior to 2014, was a single case of TAFV in 1994. These facts highlight the unpredict-
able nature of filovirus outbreaks and underscore the potential benefits of cross-species vaccines and therapeutics. 
Recently, a vesicular stomatitis virus-vectored EBOV vaccine was shown to be 100% effective in a limited clinical 
trial in Guinea7. Although highly encouraging, there is still a strong need for broad therapeutics for post-exposure 
treatment in cases of unvaccinated individuals or where the vaccine cannot be provided.
There are a number of therapeutic filovirus platforms under development including several with demon-
strated efficacy in non-human primate (NHP) models8,9. Monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails and convalescent 
IgG therapies are particularly attractive options, owing to the generally favorable pharmacokinetic properties of 
antibody therapeutics10–17. Both mAb cocktails and convalescent IgG have been shown to provide post-exposure 
protection to NHPs against EBOV and, in the case of convalescent IgG, MARV. In addition, one antibody cocktail 
known as ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical) was provided on a compassionate basis in several human cases in 
2014, is currently in clinical trials, and has been shown to reverse the course of Ebola virus disease (EVD) five

days post-infection in non-human primates8,13. Although not as advanced, protective mAbs have now also been 
described for MARV and SUDV10,11,14,18,19. Several recently reported MARV human mAbs exhibit cross-reactivity 
for the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) core11,20.
The glycoprotein GP is the sole protein on the virus surface, is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies, 
and is required for entry into host cells12,15,20–24. The prefusion GP spike consists of three copies of the two subu-
nits, GP1 (the surface subunit) and GP2 (the transmembrane or fusion subunit). Three-dimensional structures, 
determined by X-ray crystallography, have been reported for EBOV, SUDV, and MARV prefusion GP, and for 
the EBOV and MARV GP2 fusion subunit in the post-fusion conformation15,20–22,25–27. EBOV and SUDV GP 
prefusion structures are similar and consist of a trimeric chalice-and-bowl morphology, with the GP2 subunits 
forming the chalice on top of which the GP1 subunit trimer forms the bowl. Both atomic resolution (X-ray 
crystallography) and lower resolution (cryoelectron microscopy) structural studies of GP-antibody complexes 
have suggested that the GP “base” epitope, at or near the interface of GP1 and GP2 in the prefusion form, is par-
ticularly susceptible to neutralization by antibodies (Fig. 1a). EBOV neutralizing mAbs KZ52 (human), 4G7 and 
2G4 (both ZMapp components) as well as SUDV mAb 16F6 (murine) and humanized variants thereof target this 
 
region12,14,15,20–22,28. Additional components of ZMapp and related cocktails include antibodies that bind in the 
glycan cap or mucin-like domain of GP1, and whose precise function is not clear12,29. Nonetheless, the structural 
and protective data on EBOV mAbs suggest that engagement of multiple epitopes, including at least one compo-
nent directed at the GP base, is an important feature of therapeutic mAb cocktails.
Both EBOV and SUDV have caused outbreaks exceeding 300 cases, and are associated with average human 
case fatality rates of 70% and 52%, respectively, from 1976–2012. We sought to develop novel antibodies that could 
cross-neutralize and provide cross-protection in animals for these two species. Cross-reactive human polyclonal 
antibodies from vaccination of transchromosomal cattle were recently demonstrated to provide post-exposure

protection against both EBOV and SUDV in mice;30 and murine mAbs obtained from co-immunization with 
EBOV and SUDV GPs also provided partial protection of mice against both viruses with multiple doses19. These 
data suggest that protection against multiple species is possible in mice. However, only a handful of cross-reactive 
mAbs exist and none have been demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection against multiple filoviruses 
in animals18,20,31–33. Despite similar overall structural features of the prefusion assembly, and a similar suscep-
tibility site at the GP base epitope, the amino acid sequences between EBOV and SUDV GPs are significantly 
divergent (45%), which is the likely reason that cross-neutralizing antibodies against these two species are rare. 
For filoviruses and other viruses, cocktails of mAbs that engage multiple susceptible epitopes are likely to be most 
efficacious; therefore, there is a significant motivation for simplifying potential cross-neutralizing cocktails by 
development of single component, cross-neutralizing mAbs. As a step toward this goal, we report the engineering 
and in vitro characterization of bispecific antibodies that can neutralize both EBOV and SUDV, and afford com-
plete post-exposure protection in mice.
Results
Design and Binding Profiles of Bispecific Antibodies (Bis-mAbs). 
A number of design modalities 
exist for creation of altered IgG scaffolds with the capacity to engage multiple antigens34. As a preliminary eval-
uation, we chose to create simple single chain variable fragment (scFv)-IgG fusions containing variable domains 
for EBOV-specific human mAb KZ52 and the SUDV-specific humanized mAbs E10 and F4 (Fig. 1b)14,22. KZ52 
was isolated from a human survivor and has been shown to provide post-exposure protection as a single mAb 
therapy in guinea pigs and mice, but in a single study did not protect NHPs35–37. Nonetheless, KZ52 was used as 
an initial test case for EBOV-targeting Bis-mAbs because it is of human origin, and because the high resolution 
three-dimensional structure is available, which allowed us to accurately predict the beginning and end points 
of the structured variable domains. SUDV mAbs E10 and F4 were derived from synthetic libraries based on the 
Herceptin (4D5) scaffold with altered complementarity-determining region (CDR) segments from the murine 
SUDV mAb 16F6, and have been demonstrated to provide post-exposure protection of immunocompromised 
mice14. A KZ52 scFv of VH-VL topology with a (GGGS)3 linker was fused genetically to the IgGs of E10 and F4 via 
a ~GGSASGSAGSAGSGGS~ linker sequence to create the preliminary Bis-mAb panel shown in Fig. 1c. Several 
locations of the scFv were evaluated, at the N-terminus of the light chain (“LCN”) or heavy chain (“HCN”), 
and at the C-terminus of the light chain (“LCC”) and heavy chain (“HCC”). All constructs expressed readily in 
HEK293F or HEK293T suspension cells and could be purified by Protein A affinity chromatography. The “LCC” 
constructs were susceptible to degradation, presumably by proteolysis, but this could be mitigated by addition of 
protease inhibitors. Size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) anal-
ysis of constructs scKZ52-F4 HCC and scKZ52-F4 LCN indicated a monodisperse population of monomers, 
with some higher aggregate present (Supplementary Figure 1). Purified Bis-mAbs of the LCN, HCC, and LCC 
domain organization were found to be stable at 4 °C for one year with moderate degradation as analyzed by SDS-
PAGE (Supplementary Figure 2); we tested the full binding and neutralization profile of a 10-month old sample of 
scKZ52-E10 HCC and found these features to be unaffected by extended storage under these conditions.
Bis-mAbs were evaluated for reactivity toward the glycoprotein lacking the transmembrane domain from 
EBOV (Kikwik, GPEBOV) and SUDV (Boniface, GPSUDV) by ELISA (Fig. 2a). In general, most constructs exhib-
ited strong cross-reactivity with half-maximal binding titers (EC50s) ranging from 0.4–130 nM. Binding of 
Bis-mAbs to GPEBOV was strong, with EC50s in the low nanomolar or subnanomolar range for all constructs except 
scKZ52-E10 LCN, but somewhat diminished relative to monospecific KZ52 (0.01 nM, Supplementary Figure 3). 
The EC50 values for GPSUDV of the LCN and HCC domain organization were similar to previously reported values 
for monospecific IgGs F4 and E10 (3.9 and 2.1 nM, respectively)14. However, binding to GPSUDV was significantly 
lower for the HCN and LCC constructs relative to their parental monospecific IgGs. Cross-reactivity of Bis-mAbs 
to negative control wells coated with 1% BSA was observed in several cases, potentially due to unfolding tenden-
cies of the scFv fragments, but the onset of this non-specific binding activity was not until much higher antibody 
concentrations (> 
100 nM). Notably, scKZ52-F4 HCC, scKZ52-F4 LCC, scKZ52-E10 HCN and scKZ52-E10 LCN 
exhibited no cross-reactivity toward BSA. The EC50 values for GPEBOV and GPSUDV were within ~20-fold of one 
another for most Bis-mAbs, except for the “HCN” constructs, which had markedly lower activity for the GPSUDV 
and scKZ52-E10 LCN which had lower activity for GPEBOV. The disparity for the “HCN” constructs is likely 
because fusion of the KZ52 scFv to the N-terminus of the heavy chain occluded critical epitope-contacting res-
idues in the E10 and F4 VH domain. The structures for E10 and F4 are not available, but they are closely related 
to and compete with murine mAb 16F6 for binding to GPSUDV, which requires extensive interactions between 
CDR-H1 and CDR-H3 and the GP epitope15.
The binding affinities of scKZ52-F4 LCN and scKZ52-F4 HCC were characterized by biolayer interferometry 
(BLI, Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table 1). Modeling of initial association and dissociation phases in single-phase 
binding experiments with scKZ52-F4 HCC to GPEBOV or GPSUDV provided dissociation constants (KDs) of 240 nM 
for GPEBOV and 170 nM for GPSUDV. The observed affinity for GPSUDV of the Bis-mAb is similar to affinity estimates 
of the canonical F4 IgG1s by competition ELISA (100–200 nM), indicating that the scFv fusion did not alter the 
affinity of the combining site. However, the affinity of the Bis-mAbs for GPEBOV was significantly lower than has 
been reported for the KZ52 IgG1 by surface plasmon resonance (KD = 
 6.3 nM), likely because conversion from 
the IgG to the scFv format compromises structural integrity of the VH-VL interface38. The capacity of Bis-mAbs 
scKZ52-F4 LCN and scKZ52- F4 HCC to engage both antigenic targets simultaneously was also examined in 
two-phase binding experiments. Immobilized Bis-mAb on the biosensor probe was first exposed to analyte solu-
tions containing GPEBOV followed by a short equilibrium phase and transfer to a solution containing GPSUDV 
(Fig. 2b). The results demonstrate that both GP antigens can be engaged simultaneously.

Virus Neutralization. 
The Bis-mAbs were tested for their capacity to inhibit viral entry in a single-round 
infectivity experiment using vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with GP from EBOV or SUDV (VSV-GPEBOV 
and VSV-GPSUDV) (Fig. 3a,b)14,39. In this assay, VSV-GPEBOV or VSV-GPSUDV particles bearing enhanced green flu-
orescent protein (eGFP) in the viral genome are used to infect a monolayer of Vero cells, and infection events are 
quantified by fluorescence microscopy. A preliminary high-point (100 nM) assay of all Bis-mAbs demonstrated 
potent neutralization, > 
90% in most cases, of VSV-GPEBOV (Fig. 3a). All Bis-mAbs except the HCN constructs 
also exhibited strong neutralization against VSV-GPSUDV; the lack of HCN activity against VSV-GPSUDV correlates 
with the reduced binding observed by ELISA. In contrast, the monospecific controls KZ52 (EBOV), and F4 and 
E10 (SUDV) had neutralizing activity against only the relevant pseudotyped virus. Furthermore, equimolar mix-
tures of E10 + 
 KZ52 or F4 + 
 KZ52 (130 nM total antibody concentration, which corresponds to an equivalent 
mass amount of Bis-mAb) provided similar neutralization of both pseudotyped viruses.
Based on favorable expression and stability profiles, Bis-mAbs scKZ52-F4 LCN, scKZ52-F4 HCC, scKZ52-E10 
LCN, and scKZ52-E10 HCC were chosen for additional analysis. These four Bis-mAbs showed dose-dependent 
neutralization of both VSV-GP pseudotyped viruses, although the IC50 values were in general higher for 
VSV-GPSUDV than VSV-GPEBOV for the “LCN” constructs (Fig. 3b). For both “HCC” constructs the relative IC50 
values for the two pseudotyped viruses were approximately the same. In all cases, the highest levels (≥ 
95%) of 
neutralization were achieved at 100 nM Bis-mAb concentration against both pseudotyped viruses. The mono-
specifc controls were found to have IC50 values of 2.7 nM (KZ52 vs. VSV-GPEBOV), 3.5 nM (F4 vs. GPSUDV), and 
7.0 nM (E10 vs. VSV-GPSUDV) (Supplemental Fig. 4), indicating that neutralization potential was generally com-
parable for VSV-GPEBOV upon conversion of the KZ52 variable domains into a scFv. Modification of the F4 and 
E10 IgGs resulted in moderate reductions in activity when the KZ52 scFv was conjugated in the LCN format,

but had no effect in the HCC format. The four Bis-mAbs were also tested for their capacity to neutralize authen-
tic EBOV (Kikwit-1995) and SUDV (Boniface-2000) under BioSafety Level 4 (BSL4) conditions using a plaque 
reduction neutralization test (PRNT) (Fig. 3c). For all Bis-mAbs, potent neutralization of both EBOV and SUDV 
were observed in both assays, with low- or sub-nanomolar IC50 values in the PRNT assay for both viruses.
In Vivo Efficacy. 
To explore the protective potential of a single cross-binding monoclonal antibody agent, 
scKZ52-F4 LCN and scKZ52-F4 HCC were evaluated for their ability to confer protection of mice in two separate 
mouse models with post-exposure dosing (Fig. 4). These two Bis-mAbs were chosen because the LCN and HCC 
domain organizations were the best performing in both binding and neutralization studies. SUDV mAbs F4 and 
E10 are highly similar in terms of properties, differing by only a few amino acid substitutions, and therefore the 
F4 backbone should be representative14. For EBOV, a well-established mouse challenge model was employed with 
mouse-adapted (ma) EBOV (Mayinga) and WT C57BL/6 mice40. For SUDV, we have previously reported a model 
for pathogenicity that utilizes type I interferon α 
/β 
 receptor knockout mice infected at 4 weeks old with human 
lethal SUDV (Boniface)14,41. For maEBOV, a single Bis-mAb dose (200 μ 
g) was provided 24 hours post-challenge 
and for SUDV, two doses (500 μ 
g each) were provided at one and four days post-exposure. We note that the 
SUDV model, which involves immunocompromised mice infected at 4 weeks of age, provides a more stringent 
requirement for protection against initial viral challenge, and thus higher antibody doses are required than that 
used for the maEBOV model. Mono-specific mAbs Z.6D8 (EBOV) and F4 (SUDV) were included as controls as 
they have previously shown excellent protection against their respective viruses14.
Both Bis-mAb treatments resulted in high (> 
70%) protection in both models, with scKZ52-F4 HCC confer-
ring 100% protection against both viruses. As expected, Z.6D8 as a treatment was not protective against SUDV 
but was highly protective (89%) against EBOV. SUDV monospecific mAb F4 provided 100% protection against 
SUDV, as we have previously reported14 and afforded partial (30%) protection against maEBOV. However, we 
note that the level of protection for F4 against maEBOV is not statistically distinguishable from a PBS control

 0.13). Murine 16F6 afforded no protection against 
maEBOV in a group size of n =

scKZ52-F4 HCC was statistically distinguishable from both PBS and F4 controls in this experiment, whereas 70% 
protection of scKZ52-F4 LCN was distinguishable only from the PBS. These results indicate that both scKZ52-F4

both Bis-mAbs and F4 were significantly protective relative to the Z.6D8 negative control treatment group.

However, the surviving Bis-mAb or mAb-treated population continued to gain weight (on average) after day 8. 
 
For maEBOV, mean weight loss was observed during the initial infection period for scKZ52-F4 LCN- and 
F4-treated mice, as some mice became sick, but this trend was not observed with either Z.6D8 or scKZ52-F4 
HCC mice. All mice from the Z.6D8- and scKZ52-F4 HCC-treated groups survived the infection.
To examine the capacity for memory immunity in Bis-mAb and mAb-treated mice, the surviving cohort of 
both EBOV and SUDV challenges were subjected to rechallenge (with the same isolate of virus) without mAb 
treatment 35 days after the initial challenge (Fig. 4c,d). For both EBOV and SUDV, Bis-mAb or mAb treated mice 
were completely protected against viral rechallenge with no observable aggregate weightloss, indicating memory 
immunity had been established. In both cases, an untreated negative control group was also included to confirm 
lethality of the virus.
Discussion
We describe here the design and characterization of Bis-mAbs with potent neutralization activity against both 
EBOV and SUDV. Viral therapeutic bispecific antibody modalities have previously been described to target 
multiple serotypes of Dengue virus, or simultaneously engage host and viral components for HIV-142,43; the 
work described here represents the first use of this approach to develop cross-neutralizing filovirus antibod-
ies. Since EBOV and SUDV have collectively accounted for 95% of Ebola-related deaths from 1976–2012, these 
two viruses were chosen as an initial test case for development of cross-neutralizing Bis-mAbs. Both compo-
nents of the Bis-mAb design contain human or humanized scaffolds, and therefore this particular combination 
of antibodies may be desirable for therapeutic purposes. Although there is potential for therapeutic synergy of 
designed Bis-mAbs, alone or as components of cocktails, relative to traditional antibodies, this has not been 
tested explicitly here. The studies herein provide proof-of-concept that an antibody with two binding modalities 
(KZ52 and F4/E10 Fvs) is sufficient to confer high levels of post-exposure protection in mice against EBOV and 
SUDV. The effectiveness of other combinations of antibodies targeting other regions of GP, and whether they 
provide enhanced protective ability remains to be determined. While protection of mice provides a good initial 
criterion, evaluation in larger animal models will be required to fully assess the potential of any broad filovirus 
immunotherapy.
It is noteworthy that complete (scKZ52-F4 HCC) or near-complete (scKZ52-F4 LCN) cross-protection 
could be afforded by genetic linkage of two mAbs recognizing the GP base epitope. Two of the EBOV cocktail 
ZMapp components (c2G4 and c4G7) bind in this region, although with different angles relative to the plane of 
the viral membrane12. In addition, the atomic features for recognition by KZ52 (EBOV) and 16F6 (SUDV), for 
which X-ray structures are available, indicate that there are some structural differences between the epitopes15,22. 
Nonetheless, it appears that binding the GP base epitope is important for neutralization and confers protection 
at least in rodent models for these two filoviruses. Our studies establish that a single agent with specificities 
toward base epitopes of two GPs can afford this cross-protective capability. Whether or not other filoviruses will 
be susceptible at this epitope is still unknown; structural studies on the MARV GP suggest that this region may 
be occluded by the mucin-like domain, which is predicted to sit lower on the prefusion spike than on EBOV or 
SUDV20. Nonetheless, our work suggests that cross-neutralization efforts should focus on the GP base epitope, 
and that cross-species protection can be achieved by a single agent for at least these two filoviruses.
Although the precise requirements for GP epitopes and protection in larger animals has not been estab-
lished across filovirus species, for antiviral immunotherapies in general, it seems likely that targeting of multiple 
epitopes within a mAb cocktail would be advantageous. Engagement of multiple epitopes allows for multiple 
potential mechanisms of protection, for example, non-neutralizing mAbs can also provide protection through 
Fc-mediated functions. In addition, binding to multiple epitopes reduces the risk of escape by a single mutation. 
For EBOV, protection of NHPs by a single mAb has not been demonstrated, and for SUDV, protection of NHPs 
by mAbs in general has not been shown. Since cross-neutralizing mAbs for EBOV and SUDV are rare, a potential 
strategy to reduce complexities of cross-protective cocktails is the combination of two or more binding specifici-
ties by antibody engineering. Here we demonstrate that this approach provides complete protection in one case 
for mice. The Bis-mAb format described here has therapeutic potential, but other formats that do not employ long 
polypeptide linkers, which are susceptible to proteolysis or that may lead to immunogenicity, would be desirable 
for a cross-neutralizing mAb targeting this region.
Methods
Antibody Expression and Purification. 
The synthetic genes for all Bis-mAbs were obtained from a com-
mercial supplier (Genewiz, Plainview, NJ) and subcloned into pMAZ-IgL and pMAZ-IgH vectors44. Vectors for 
the heavy and light chain were transfected into HEK293F cells (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) using 2 μ 
g/mL 
linear polyethylenimine (PEI) molecular weight 25,000 Daltons according to the manufacturer’s instructions 
(Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Cell cultures were incubated at 37 °C and 8% CO2 for 5–6 days post-trans-
fection. The cell cultures were centrifuged and the supernatants were applied to a protein-A affinity column 
(~1 mL packed beads per 600 mL culture) (Pierce, ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL). Bis-mAbs were purified using 
the Gentle Antibody Elution System (Pierce, ThermoScientific, Rockford, IL) as per manufacturer’s protocol. 
Antibodies were desalted into 150 mM HEPES and 200 mM NaCl pH 7.4 for use in experiments.
Antibodies used in mouse challenge studies were produced under endotoxin-free conditions by KempBio, Inc. 
(Frederick, MD). HEK293T cells in serum-free suspension culture were cultivated in shake-flasks incubated at 
37 °C with an atmosphere composed of 95% Air + 
 5% CO2. The culture medium was FreeStyle 293 (ThermoFisher 
Rockford, IL) supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine and 50 mg/L G418 (both ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL). The 
plasmids used for each transfection were amplified in DH5-α 
 cells (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL) and purified 
using an endotoxin-free kit from Macherey Nagel. The HEK293T cells were transfected in log-phase growth 
when the cell density was between 1 and 1.5 × 
 106 cells per mL. Equal amounts of each plasmid were combined

Scientific RepoRts | 6:19193 | DOI: 10.1038/srep19193
to yield a total of 1 milligram of plasmid DNA per liter of culture. Each milligram of DNA was complexed with 
 
4 milligrams of PEI-Max (MW 40000, Polysciences, 1 mg/mL in saline) and incubated for 5 minutes at room 
temperature prior to addition to the cell cultures. The cultures were maintained as described above for 120 hours 
and the culture supernatant containing the recombinant antibody was harvested and filter sterilized. Protein 
purification was performed using Protein A resin (MabSelect, GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and polished using 
Capto-Adhere resin (GE). The level of aggregation was assessed using size exclusion chromatography (S-200 
Sephacryl 16/60, GE) and the endotoxin level was determined using the ToxinSensor Kit (GenScript, Piscataway, 
NJ). The final buffer for each antibody was PBS pH 7.4 (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL) and the final protein level 
was assayed using A280 with an extinction coefficient of 1.4. The product was filter sterilized and stored at − 
20 or 
2–8 °C.
ELISA Assays. 
GP proteins expressed from HEK293 cells were purchased as previously described from the 
Protein Expression Laboratory, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research14. The GP target proteins 
were directly immobilized onto 96-well Maxisorp plates (GPSUDV and GPEBOV = 
 0.5 μ 
g/well) by incubating in PBS 
 
pH 8.0 for 14–16 hours at 4 °C. PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA was used to block the wells after target immobi-
lization (incubation for 90–120 minutes at RT). Negative control plates were coated with 1% BSA only. Bis-mAbs 
were diluted into PBT (PBS pH 7.4, 1% BSA, and 0.05% Tween-20), applied to the wells, and incubated at RT for 
1 hour. The plates were washed with PBST (PBS pH 7.4 and 0.05% Tween-20) and incubated for 60 minutes with 
Protein A/HRP antibody conjugate (1:1000 dilution in PBT). The wells were washed 4–6 times with PBST, devel-
oped using 3, 3′ 
, 5, 5′ 
-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and quenched with 0.5 M 
sulfuric acid. The absorbance at 450 nm was determined. The data was fit to standard four-parameter logistic 
equations using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). The half-maximal binding titers (EC50) were 
obtained from the inflection point in the curves.
BioLayer Interferometry. 
The forteBio BLItz system was used to determine the binding properties of anti-
bodies to GPEBOV and GPSUDV. Anti-human Fc capture sensors were used for initial antibody loading, which was 
followed by GPEBOV or GPSUDV protein association and dissociation. Several different GPEBOV or GPSUDV concen-
trations, ranging from 0.125 μ 
M to 3.6 μ 
M, were used. For single-phase binding experiments, global data fitting 
to a 1:1 binding model was used to estimate the ka (association rate constant), kd (dissociation rate constant) and 
KD (equilibrium dissociation constant) values. For double-phase binding experiment, antibody was immobilized 
first on sensor, and then allowed to equilibrate in a solution containing one of the GPs. The sensor was then trans-
ferred to a second solution containing the other GP.
Pseudotyped Virus Neutralization Assays. 
Neutralization assays were performed using vesicular sto-
matitis virus pseudotyped to display the GP from either SUDV or EBOV in place of its native G glycoprotein 
(VSV-GPSUDV or VSV-GPEBOV, respectively)14,39. The viral genome encodes an enhanced green fluorescent protein 
(eGFP) so that infection is scored by counting fluorescent cells after infection. The protocol for VSV-GP produc-
tion has been described elsewhere45. Briefly, the virus-containing supernatants were harvested and concentrated 
by pelleting through a 10% sucrose cushion. Virus stocks were titered by infecting African Green Monkey kidney 
(Vero) cells with serial dilutions and counting eGFP-positive cells by fluorescence microscopy. VSV-GP was used 
to infect Vero cells at approximate multiplicities of infection of 0.1 to 1.0 in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium 
(DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA), such that 20–200 cells were 
infected per well. Vero cell monolayers consisting of ~7.5 × 
 104 cells/well in a 48 well plate were incubated for 
14–16 hours with pseudotyped virus that had been pre-incubated for 1 to 2 hours with dilutions of the Bis-mAb. 
Infection was scored by manually counting eGFP-positive cells under a fluorescence microscope, 14–16 hours 
after initial exposure. Virus was added to a well containing media alone (no antibody) to serve as a control for 
100% infection.
Alternatively, a 96-well format was adopted to facilitate rapid generation of dose-dependent curves for neu-
tralization. Vero cell monolayers were seeded at ~2.0 × 
 104 cells/well in a 96 well plate and grown to conflu-
ency overnight at 37 °C. Pseudotyped viruses that had been pre-incubated for 1 hour with dilutions of Bis-mAb 
were incubated with the cells for 14–16 hours in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS at 37 °C. Cells were then 
fixed using formaldehyde and stained with Hoechst 33342 Trihydrochloride, Trihydrate staining solution 
(ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL). Infection was then scored using the Thermo Scientific Cell Insight CX5 platform 
microscope and software that scores infection based on percentage of infected cells ([# of GFP positive cells/# of 
Hoechst positive cells]*100%). Virus added to wells with no antibody was used as a control for 100% infectivity, 
and wells with no virus and no antibody were used as 0% infection.
Plaque reduction neutralization test with authentic pathogens. 
Dilutions of the antibody of inter-
est were made in a sterile 96 well plate (Costar/Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) in Eagle Minimum Essential 
Media (EMEM) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 5% FBS. In sterile 6 well plate (Costar/
Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY), 125 μ 
L of authentic EBOV or SUDV diluted to 1200 pfu/mL were added 
to each well and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 hour. Virus was added to a well containing media alone 
(no antibody) as a control for 100% infection. Vero-E6 cells were exposed to 100 μ 
L of the virus/antibody mixture 
and incubated at 37 °C for an additional hour. During this time, the plates were gently rocked every 15 minutes to 
ensure homogeneity and prevent drying. After 1 hour of incubation, 2 mLs of primary overlay (EMEM with 10% 
FBS and 1% Gentamicin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 1% SeaKem ME agarose (Lonza, Cohasset, MN)) 
was added to each well and the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 6 days. On Day 7 post-exposure to virus, neutral 
red solution (EMEM with 10% FBS and 1% Gentamicin with 5% neutral red (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, 
 www.nature.com/scientificreports/

Scientific RepoRts | 6:19193 | DOI: 10.1038/srep19193
NY)) was added to all cell-containing wells and cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Infection was scored by 
counting the number of plaques per well, using the number of plaques on the control well (no antibody) as 100% 
infection.
Mouse Challenge Experiments. 
Research was conducted under an IACUC approved protocol in compli-
ance with the Animal Welfare Act, PHS Policy, and other federal statutes and regulations relating to animals and 
experiments involving animals. The facility where this research was conducted is accredited by the Association 
for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, International and adheres to principles stated in 
the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 2011.
Female C57BL/6 mice (6–14 weeks) (Jackson Laboratories) were challenged via the intraperitoneal route (I.P.) 
with 1,000 plaque forming units (pfu) (~30,000 LD50) mouse-adapted EBOV (maEBOV). Mice were treated 
one-day post-challenge I.P. with 200 μ 
g of antibody or PBS. Mice were observed daily for clinical signs of disease 
and lethality. Daily observations were increased to a minimum of twice daily while mice were exhibiting signs of 
disease. Moribund mice were humanely euthanized on the basis of IACUC- approved criteria.
Male and female Type 1 IFN α 
/β 
 receptor knockout mice (Type 1 IFNα 
/β 
 R−/−) purchased from Jackson 
Laboratory (4–14 weeks of age) were utilized for SUDV challenge experiments. Mice were challenged I.P. with a 
target dose of 1,000 pfu (~30,000 LD50) of wild-type SUDV and treated I.P. with 500 μ 
g of indicated mAb at day 
+ 
1 and + 
4.
Surviving mice from both experiments were rechallenged I. P. with target dose of 1,000 pfu of either maEBOV 
or wild-type SUDV with no mAb treatment provided. Following all challenges mice were observed daily for clin-
ical signs of disease and lethality. Daily observations were increased to a minimum of twice daily while mice were 
exhibiting signs of disease. Moribund mice were humanely euthanized on the basis of IACUC- approved criteria.
Statistical comparisons of survival probability for both EBOV and SUDV challenges were made using the 
Fisher exact test with Bonferroni correction.
