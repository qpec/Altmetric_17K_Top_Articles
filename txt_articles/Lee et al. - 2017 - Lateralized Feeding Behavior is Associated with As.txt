Abstract
Lateralized behavior (“handedness”) is unusual, but consistently found across diverse animal lineages, including humans. It is
thought to reflect brain anatomical and/or functional asymmetries, but its neuro-molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown.
Lake Tanganyika scale-eating cichlid fish, Perissodus microlepis show pronounced asymmetry in their jaw morphology as well as

After determining behavioral handedness in P. microlepis (preferred attack side), we estimated the volume of the hemispheres of

at the level of neuroanatomical asymmetry, particularly in the tectum opticum. Transcriptome analyses showed that different brain
regions (tectum opticum, telencephalon, hypothalamus, and cerebellum) display distinct expression patterns, potentially reflecting
their developmental interrelationships. For numerous genes in each brain region, their extent of expression differences between
hemispheres was found to be correlated with the degree of behavioral lateralization. Interestingly, the tectum opticum and telen-
cephalon showed divergent biases on the direction of up- or down-regulation of the laterality candidate genes (e.g., grm2) in the
hemispheres,highlightingtheconnectionofhandednesswithgeneexpressionprofilesandthedifferentrolesofthesebrainregions.
Hence, handedness in predation behavior may be caused by asymmetric size of brain hemispheres and also by lateralized gene
expressions in the brain.

Introduction
Behavioral handedness (or behavioral lateralization) is the ten-
dency of an individual to favor one side of the body over the
other. Humans are behaviorally lateralized: most of us are
right-handed (89%) and a minority are left-handed (8%),
whereas
truly
ambidextrous
individuals

(3%)
(Vuoksimaa et al. 2009). A number of studies provided evi-
dence that not only humans, but also other vertebrates such

 as chimpanzees, dolphins, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and
fishes, but also invertebrates do exhibit lateralized behaviors
(e.g., reviewed in Vallortigara et al. 2011). For example, a
preferred usage of the right hand was also observed in our
closest relatives, the chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes (Hopkins
and Cantalupo 2005). Right-eye preference for swimming
counter-clockwise in bottlenose dolphins, Tursiops truncatus
has recently been reported (Clark and Kuczaj II 2016).
Behavioral biases are also documented for some birds such
as parrots and cockatoos that preferentially use one foot over
the other to handle food and objects more effectively (Harris
1989). Even in a spider (Scytodes globula) a bias in leg use
during prey handling has been described (Ades and Ramires
2002). Although behavioral handedness is found across a va-
riety of distantly related animal lineages, it is not clear how
widespread it is. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that
handed
behavior
may
provide
ecological
benefits
(Vallortigara and Rogers 2005), and it has an ancient evolu-
tionary origin (Vallortigara et al. 1999).
Behavioral lateralization has been suggested to be associ-
ated with brain asymmetry involving neuroanatomical (struc-
tural) asymmetries and/or lateralized brain functions (Rogers
and Andrew 2002). The best documented case of a correlation
betweenbehaviorallateralizationandbrainstructuralasymme-
tries comes from humans, where the central sulcus surface on
the cerebrum in the brain was found to be greater in the left
hemisphere than in the right (White et al. 1994). This human
structural (cortical) asymmetry has been suggested to have a
molecular genetic basis (Sun et al. 2005; Johnson et al. 2009;
Hibar et al. 2015). In birds such as chickens and pigeons, differ-
ential light exposure to one eye during development gives rises
toastructuralasymmetryinthevisualpathwaysthatisdrivenby
lateralized behavior (Rogers and Deng 1999). The relationship
between behavioral lateralization and neural structure asym-
metry has also been shown in other vertebrates such as zebra-
fish(Conchaetal.2000)andtheconvictcichlidfish,Amatitlania
nigrofasciata (e.g., in the habenular nucleus; Gutie
´rrez-Ib�
a~
nez
et al. 2011). However, examples of such a correlation, and pos-
sible cause-effect relationship, remain few (Gutie
´rrez-Ib�
a~
nez
et al. 2011), and the functional basis of this association is still
only poorly understood (Ichijo et al. 2017).
Evidence for the functional brain asymmetries related to
behavioral lateralization is relatively well documented in
humans, for example, functional hemispheric specialization
on language and other cognitive functions predominantly lo-
calized in the left half of the brain, whereas spatial recognition
islocalizedintheright(Galaburdaetal.1978;Gazzaniga2005;
Sun and Walsh 2006). Indeed, most right-handed humans
show a strong language specialization towards the left brain
hemisphere, whereas left-handed individuals indicate less dis-
tinct patterns (Coren 1992). Several studies of other verte-
brates have further demonstrated that their two brain
hemispheres also have distinctive functional roles (reviewed
in MacNeilage et al. 2009). Although ordinary (naturally
occurring) behaviors such as foraging behavior were shown
to be retained towards the left hemisphere in vertebrate ani-
mals examined so far, including birds, fishes, toads, baboons,
and whales, wariness (e.g., in the presence of predators) or
memory-based individual recognition behaviors were primarily
governed by the right hemisphere (MacNeilage et al. 2009).
Examples for causal relationships of laterality underlying mac-
roscopic structural differences or size, that is, “molecular ge-
netic
associations”
between
lateralized
behavior
and
differences between the brain’s hemispheres have so far
been documented exclusively for humans (e.g., Sun et al.
2005; Johnson et al. 2009; but see deCarvalho et al. 2014).
Future study of other vertebrate species will help to advance
our understanding of the neuro-molecular basis of lateralized
behavior more generally.
A well-documentedcaseofbehaviorallateralizationinfishis
scale-eating (lepidophagous) in cichlids of the species,
Perissodus microlepis that are endemic to Lake Tanganyika in
Africa (Hori 1993; Futuyma 2009). Some individuals of this spe-
cies preferentially attack the left flanks of their prey fish to bite
offscales(“right-handed”),othersattacktherightflanks(“left-
handed”), and a small minority attack both flanks with similar
frequencies (no “handedness”) (Lee et al. 2012). This handed
behavior is already expressed earlyin juvenile P. microlepis at an
ageof2months(Leeetal.2012),andisknowntobecorrelated
with morphological mouth asymmetry (fig. 1A and B; Hori
1993; Lee et al. 2010; Van Dooren et al. 2010; Kusche et al.
2012; Takeuchi et al. 2012, 2016), which is found to be under
polygenic control (Lee et al. 2015; Raffini et al. 2016). This
predicted relationship between morphological and behavioral
lateralityissometimeslessstrongforlaboratory-raisedfishwith-
out prior experience feeding on scales from prey fish (Lee et al.
2012). The molecular basis or neuro-molecular mechanisms
underlying this remarkable behavioral laterality remain un-
known and are the focus of this study.
Genome-wide RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) permits the ex-
ploration of the functional basis of the expressed genes rela-
tively quickly and effectively (Conesa et al. 2016). In particular,
RNA-Seq facilitates the study of the gene regulatory networks
of ecologically or evolutionarily intriguing traits in nonmodel
organisms,eveniftheir genomeshavenotbeensequencedyet
(e.g., Elmer et al. 2010). Several recent studies using RNA-Seq
have been performed to study gene expression patterns and
genetic pathways underlying key ecological traits in fishes
(e.g., Gunter et al. 2013; Henning et al. 2013; Manousaki
et al. 2013; Kang et al. 2015). Yet, the genetic underpinnings
ofadaptivebehavioralphenotypesandtheroleofgeneexpres-
sion differences in regulating behavior remain largely unidenti-
fied (e.g., Whitfield et al. 2003; Aubin-Horth et al. 2005; Renn
et al. 2008; Drew et al. 2012; Harris and Hofmann 2014).
In the present study, we investigated whether lateralized
foraging behavior in the Lake Tanganyika scale-eating cichlid
fish, Perissodus microlepis, is correlated with brain neuroana-
tomical (structural) asymmetry (fig. 1C and D). We also

 performed transcriptome analyses on different regions of the
fish’s brains and on both left and right hemispheres in order to
link behavioral handedness to gene transcriptional differences
between hemispheres in P. microlepis. For this, we investi-
gated whether genes showed a correlation between the de-
gree of gene expression fold-change between hemispheres
and that of lateralized behavior. The specific objectives of this
study were 4-fold: 1) to test whether behavioral handedness
in P. microlepis is related to left-right asymmetry in neural
structures; 2) to explore the tissue-specific gene expression
profiles regardless of an individuals’ handed feeding behaviors
and hemispheric regions; 3) to investigate if the differences in
gene expression in each paired bilaterally symmetrical brain
region (i.e., tectum opticum, telencephalon, and hypothala-
mus; fig. 1D) between left and right hemispheres can be
linked to the degree of lateralized behavior; and 4) to identify
potential candidate genes in each brain region that might
underlie behavioral laterality. The results of our study will
open a novel perspective on the functional genomic basis of
this remarkable case of behavioral laterality and lay the
ground for future research on behavioral genetics/genomics.
Materials and Methods
Samples
Twenty-seven Perissodus microlepis individuals were used to
determine whether brain anatomical (or structural) asymmetry
is correlated with behavioral foraging lateral preference. Fish
were 6–10 months of age, from two laboratory-bred broods
fromwild-caughtparents(NH� NH[no“handedness”observ-
able, i.e. fish were showing an equal preference and attacked
both flanksof prey],brood6,N ¼ 22;LH[“left-handed”]�NH,
brood 9, N ¼ 5) (supplementary table S1, Supplementary
Material online). Twelve additional P. microlepis individuals
(not included in the 27 fish) were used to carry out transcrip-
tome analyses on the brain to investigate the architecture of
gene regulatory mechanisms of behavioral lateralization (sup
plementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). These
were also laboratory-bred fish, 6 months of age, from a single
brood from wild-caught parents (RH [“right-handed”]�NH).
Note that in additional 12 fish from brood 6 (NH� NH),
morphological
mouth
asymmetry

jaw-
bending orientation in angle (�), after the heads of these
fish were cleared and double-stained as done in Lee et al.
(2015), was not associated with behavioral lateralization
(Y ¼ �0.027Xþ 0.207, R2¼ 0.005, P ¼ 0.836) (Lein 2012).
The parental fish for the test batches of P. microlepis were
obtained in April 2010 by diving with hand nets at Toby Veal’s
Lodge (S08�37.4’ E031�12’) near Mpulungu, Zambia on the
southern tip of Lake Tanganyika (Kusche et al. 2012; Lee et al.
2012, 2015, 2016). The fish were kept at the animal research
facility of the University of Konstanz, Germany. All the broods

Foraging Preference Experiments
To determine behavioral laterality (foraging preference ¼
handedness) in the 39 juvenile P. microlepis, we conducted
foraging experiments in a 40L experimental tank (see Lee
et al. 2012). The scale-eaters were placed individually with a
single prey fish (goldfish, Carassius auratus). The test fish was
placed into the trial tank at least 4 h prior to the experiment.
For each fish, foraging behavior was monitored by counting
the number of attacks to the left and/or right flanks on a
single goldfish until a total of 20 attacks per individual were
reached (with some exceptions; supplementary tables S1 and
S2, Supplementary Material online) (Lee et al. 2012). Standard
length (SL) of the test fish, SL of the prey fish, average time
taken per attack, and our determined behavioral preferences
for the 12 fish used for brain transcriptomics are shown in
supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online.
There was some variation in the length of the foraging trials
(total number of attacks: N ¼ 17–21) among the 12 test fish
(6.7–45.0min; mean ¼ 25.56 12 [SD] min), which might po-
tentially affect gene expression patterns because the time
since the first attack and the collection of the brain tissue
varied. The number of left and right attacks, behavioral pref-
erences and estimated brain hemisphere volumes (see below)
for the 27 fish used to examine structural asymmetry are pro-
vided in supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material
online.
To determine behavioral laterality (handedness), the forag-
ing laterality index (FLI) [FLI foraging¼ (number of attacks right �
number of attacks left)/(number of attacks right þ number of
attacks left)] was calculated individually (Facchin et al. 1999).
Negative values of FLI indicate more frequent attacks on the
prey’s left flank (i.e., P. microlepis showed right-handed be-
havior), whereas positive values indicate more frequent
attacks of the right flank of the prey fish (left-handed behav-
ior; fig. 1B). For the statistical analyses, behavioral laterality
was treated as a continuous variable. We also classified these
fish based on the FLI into three behavioral groups, right-
handed (RH) individuals, left-handed (LH) individuals, as well
as individuals with no apparent handedness (NH). Fish ID 50
and 51 were considered LH fish, although binomial tests
indicated marginal P values: 0.058 and 0.072 for fish ID 50
and 51, respectively (supplementary table S2, Supplementary
Material online). More fish were tested for behavioral
laterality, but we selected only 12 fish for the transcriptomic
analysis (see below).

 Brain Volume Measurements
To investigate the relationship between anatomical brain
asymmetry and foraging behavior in Perissodus microlepis,
brains of the 27 juvenile fish were dissected immediately after
the foraging experiments and volumes of three bilaterally
symmetrical brain regions (i.e., telencephalon, tectum opti-
cum, and hypothalamus) were measured individually by the
same person (E.L.) (fig. 1D), following the procedures of
Pollen et al. (2007) and Gonzalez-Voyer and Kolm (2010).
The test fish were euthanized by immersion in ice-slush water
(2–4 �C) (Matthews and Varga 2012) right after the foraging
trials and the brain volume was estimated from blind meas-
urements with respect to the foraging type to avoid a possible
observer’s bias. Olfactory bulbs were excluded from this anal-
ysis because of a relatively lower repeatability (r< 0.75) of our
volume measurements detected (see below), probably due to
its relatively small size (fig. 1C and D; supplementary fig. S1,
Supplementary Material online). Brains were digitally photo-
graphed using a Zeiss Axiophot digital microscope (Zeiss,
Germany), and width (W), length (L), and height (H) of each
of the brain structures were then measured using ImageJ
1.45r (http://imagej.nih.gov/ij; last accessed October 23,
2017) to estimate their volumes (supplementary fig. S1,
Supplementary Material online for measurement illustrations).
According to Pollen et al. (2007) and Gonzalez-Voyer and
Kolm (2010), the width (W) was measured as the greatest
distance of a particular brain region that is perpendicular to
the anatomical midline, the length (L) was measured as the
greatest distance by that particular brain region parallel along
the axis of the brain, and height (H) was measured as the
greatest distance perpendicular to the body axis for that par-
ticular brain structure (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary
Material online).
The brain volume (V) was then calculated according to an
ellipsoid
model
(Van
Staaden
et
al.
1995):
V
(in
mm3)¼ (L� W� H) p/6. The method employed in this study
is a well-established and standardized protocol for the estima-
tion of brain volumes in fishes (e.g., Pollen et al. 2007;
Gonzalez-Voyer and Kolm 2010). A Spearman rank correla-
tion analysis was conducted to test for a significant relation-
ship between the ratio of brain hemisphere volumes (left to
right) and behavioral laterality (i.e., FLI). We used a nonpara-
metric test for this analysis because the assumption of nor-
mality was not satisfied (FLI: Shapiro–Wilk test, W ¼ 0.897,
P ¼ 0.011). Three different Spearman rank correlation analy-
ses were also performed for the paired brain structures.
To assess the accuracy of these measurements, repeatabil-
ity (r) of the brain volume measures was estimated from in-
dependently repeated and “blind” measurements that were
undertaken from two replicate photographs of each structure
of the same individuals from a subsample (N ¼ 13) using one-
way ANOVA with individual as the factor, as suggested in
Sokal and Rohlf (1995).
Brain Transcriptome Analyses
Brain Dissection and RNA Extraction
Brains of the experimental P. microlepis fish (N ¼ 12) were iso-
lated using a fine scissor and forceps in 0.1M phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) solution on ice, immediately after the
end of the foraging trials. Seven different brain regions (telen-
cephalon-L and -R, tectum opticum-L and -R, hypothalamus-L

A total of 84 RNA samples from 12 fish [7 brain tissues� 4
individual fish� 3 (our determined) behavioral groups (RH, LH,
and NH)] were obtained. Total RNA of each brain tissue was
isolated with Trizol (Invitrogen, USA). Tissues were homoge-
nized using pestles and mRNA was extracted with chloroform.
RNA was further purified using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). On-
column DNase treatment was performed following the man-
ufacturer’s protocols. Additional washing and drying steps
(washed columns twice with 80% EtOH to remove all traces
of salt and ethanol) followed, and samples were spun dry for
5min. RNA was eluted in RNase and DNase free water. RNA
purity was assessed by a Nanodrop (Thermo Scientific, USA) by
measuringitsabsorbanceat260and280nmandRNAintegrity
(RIN) was measured using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, USA).
RNA samples with 260/280 ratio> 2.0 and RIN value> 8.5
were used for downstream library preparation.
Library Construction and Sequencing
Total RNAs recovered from the 81 brain tissues of P. micro-
lepis (except for three RNA samples that failed qualification
criteria for RNA purity or integrity: fish ID 55 hypothalamus-L
and cerebellum; fish ID 57 tectum opticum-R) were subjected
to a RNA-Seq protocol. Sequencing libraries were generated
using the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation kit (Low-
Throughput protocol) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 500ng
of RNA was subjected to mRNA selection using poly-T
oligo-attached magnetic beads followed by chemical frag-
mentation (5min, 94 �C). The cleaved RNA fragments were
then copied into first strand cDNA using SuperScript II reverse
transcriptase (Invitrogen, USA) and Illumina proprietary ran-
dom hexamer primers. After second strand synthesis using
Illumina-supplied consumables, the cDNA was amplified
with reagents of the same kit according to the manufacturer’s
protocol and ligated to barcoded adapters. The final libraries
were amplified using 15 PCR cycles. Quality assessment of the
libraries was performed on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and
the quantification was carried out in the Qubit 2.0 fluorom-
eter (Life Technologies, USA). The 81 barcoded samples were
equimolar-pooled and the same pool was loaded in 7 lanes of
an Illumina flowcell in order to obtain technical replication and
considerable sequencing depth. Paired-end sequencing of
clustered template DNA was performed on an Illumina
HiSeq2000 at the Tufts University Genomics Centre in
Boston (TUCF Genomics) using four-color DNA Sequencing-
By-Synthesis (SBS) technology with 210 cycles (101 cycles for
each paired-read and eight cycles for the barcode sequences).
Read Quality Control
After sequencing, we obtained 1,380,519,871 raw reads of
101bp each (average reads per sample ¼ 17,043,455) that
were quality-controlled before assembly, read mapping and
downstream analyses. Reads were quality-controlled (reads
with a quality score<20 were discarded) and the remaining
adapters were removed with the fastx toolkit v0.013 using
default parameters (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/;
last accessed October 23, 2017). Finally, only filtered reads
that were >50 nucleotides in length were used for further
analyses.
Transcriptome Assembly and Annotation
For the assembly, we pooled all samples and then used a
subset of the filtered reads. We chose those that were at least
95 nucleotides in length and were paired after the quality
control (316,268,802 reads). 114,644,340 of those were
merged and collapsed to 43,142,178 longer reads. Merging
was conducted with SeqPrep (https://github.com/jstjohn/
SeqPrep; last accessed October 23, 2017) and collapsing
with fastx toolkit. For the assembly we used 100,812,231
nonmerged pairs of reads (total 201,624,462 reads) and
57,322,170 merged pairs of longer reads (114,644,340) col-
lapsed to 43,142,178 reads.
The assembly process was implemented in Trinity v2.4.0
(Grabherr et al. 2011) and resulted in 305,646 transcripts. To
further process the assembled transcripts and to exclude spu-
rious ones, we mapped the reads to the assembled transcrip-
tome using Bowtie v.1.0.0 (Langmead et al. 2009) through
RSEM v1.24 (Li and Dewey 2011) to eliminate those tran-
scripts with <1% of the reads assigned to the corresponding
genes (as suggested in Haas et al. 2013). We further restricted
transcripts <300 nucleotides in length to a compact and
meaningful transcriptome of 176,911 transcripts clustered
in 147,469 loci or components. Those sequences were used
in a BLASTx search against the NCBI protein database nr
(e-value threshold 1e�10). 70,004 transcripts and 48,968
loci had a significant hit in nr. Those that did not have a hit
were afterwards used in a BLASTn search against NCBI nucle-
otide database nt (e-value threshold 1e�10). Finally, after
retaining the sequences that had a significant hit in nr and/
or nt we obtained 83,715 loci encompassing 110,331 tran-
scripts that constituted our final assembly (N50: 798bp).

and then pooled, which provided the final count table for all
83,715 loci. The sequences of these loci were remapped to
the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) genome to retrieve pro-
tein IDs and to discard unmapped, ambiguous loci. 63,389
loci were successfully annotated with 19,145 different protein
IDs and loci with the same protein IDs were summed up sub-
sequently. The resulting count table of 19,145 proteins was
normalized per sample by dividing each protein ID’s count by
the median of all counts of that sample (supplementary table
S4, Supplementary Material online). This normalization ap-
proach was chosen as pronounced differential expression be-

approaches, such as used in DESeq2, rely on the assumption
that only relatively few genes are differentially expressed
(Dillies et al. 2013). As gene length was not considered for
this normalization, reliable comparisons of expression levels
among different genes were not feasible. Finally, gene names
and gene ontology (GO) terms were retrieved for each protein
ID from Ensembl. In spite of this, we will refer to these IDs with
their corresponding gene names throughout the paper as
gene expression was actually measured.
Analyses of Gene Expression Profiles
The transcriptional profiles of all 81 samples were investigated
using a principle component analysis (PCA) to illustrate overall
divergence in transcriptional patterns of the brain regions.
Next, genes differentially expressed between brain regions
were identified using pair-wise comparisons (“fdr”-corrected
P values of Welch ANOVAs). Finally, gene ontology (GO) term
composition of the differentially expressed genes (“test set”)
was compared with the composition of all 19,145 genes
found in all brain regions pooled (“reference set”) using
Blast2GO (Conesa et al. 2005).
Differences in gene expression between the left and right
hemispheres in the three paired brain regions were explored
based on the PCA. Also, differentially expressed genes be-
tween the two hemispheres per brain region were deter-
mined as was done for the brain regions. To identify genes
potentially underlying behavioral laterality, for each individual,
paired brain region and gene, expression fold change was
calculated by dividing the normalized gene expression value
of the behaviorally preferred prey flank (e.g., in a fish with
negative FLI preferentially attacked the left flank of the prey)
by the value of the other nonpreferred side. The log2 of these
values was then calculated, that is, if in a RH-fish a gene was
upregulated in the left brain hemisphere, the log2 fold-
change was a positive value and if it was upregulated in the
right hemisphere the log2 fold-change was a negative value.
To link the degree of behavioral lateralization to the fold
change in gene expression, linear regression models were cal-
culated for each brain region and each gene, using the abso-
lute value of FLI (i.e., values from 0.1 to 0.8) as an
independent variable and log2 fold-change of the gene as a
dependent variable. Candidate genes were chosen by select-
ing models that showed a significant slope (P < 0.05).
Additionally, genes with a model intercept potentially differ-
ent from 0 (P < 0.1) were discarded as these would not fulfill
the assumption that behaviorally no handed individuals have
no differences in gene expression between the hemispheres.
No further posthoc corrections were applied after these se-
lection steps as our results suggested that obtained overall
patterns are highly unlikely coincidental and remaining candi-
date genes are thus likely to be mostly “true positives” (see
Results section). Nonetheless, the chosen approach is more
liberal than some analyses like DESeq2 and thus particularly
less significant genes should be interpreted with caution. GO
term composition of these brain region-specific candidate
genes was explored. Results of GO term analyses were
reported and discussed only for “biological processes”, and
those for “molecular function” and “cellular component”
were also summarized. GO analyses were conducted using
Blast2GO. All analyses of gene expression were conducted in
R 3.3.0 (R Core Team 2016).
Results
Relationship between Brain Anatomical Asymmetry and
Handed Feeding Behavior
Our measurements of brain hemisphere volumes were highly
repeatable—estimated repeatability (r) was 0.88 (left [L] side)
and 0.89 (right [R] side) for the telencephalon, 0.78 (L) and
0.88 (R) for the tectum opticum, and 0.91 (L) and 0.87 (R) for
the hypothalamus. These estimates of the repeatability sug-
gest that 78� 91% of the total observed variation results
from underlying “true” variation in the brain hemisphere vol-
umes among individuals, and the remaining 9� 22% varia-
tion is caused by measurement error.
A significant negative correlation was found between the
ratio of the brain hemisphere volumes and the lateralized
foraging behavior [Spearmans’ rho (q)¼ �0.394, N ¼ 27,
P ¼ 0.042; fig. 2A), which suggests that left-handed (LH)
fish tend to have a larger right hemisphere than left hemi-
sphere, whereas right-handed (RH) fish have a relatively
larger left hemisphere (fig. 2A). At the brain-structure level
only the tectum opticum contributed to this observed signif-
icant negative relationship (q ¼ �0.455, N ¼ 27, P ¼ 0.017;
fig. 2B). The other brain regions appear to be symmetrical
(telencephalon: q ¼ �0.302, N ¼ 27, P ¼ 0.125; fig. 2C,
hypothalamus: q ¼ �0.186, N ¼ 27, P ¼ 0.353; fig. 2D),
albeit a similar trend.

 Global Expression Patterns
To estimate the relative abundance of transcripts for each
locus, we mapped the 1,023,729,409 high quality reads of
the 81 samples to the assembly and assessed their expression
profiles at the gene level. Global expression patterns of the 81
samples are shown in a PCA plot (fig. 3; supplementary fig.
S2, Supplementary Material online). Principle components
(PCs) 1–3, explaining together �86% of the total variation,
showed pronounced differences among the four brain
regions
investigated
(fig.
3;
supplementary
fig.
S2,
Supplementary Material online). The cerebellum’s gene ex-
pression profile appeared to be most divergent from the other
three brain regions, as PC1 suggests. Although the telenceph-
alon and hypothalamus load similarly on PCs 1 and 2, PC3
showed a clear distinction between these two regions (supple
mentary fig. S2, Supplementary Material online). None of the
PCs accounting cumulatively for �95% of total variation
showed any differences between the left and right hemi-
spheres for any brain region (supplementary fig. S2,
Supplementary Material online).
A large number of genes showed differential expression in
pair-wise comparisons of brain regions (left and right hemi-
spheres pooled) after fdr corrections (table 1). Notably, ap-
proximately three quarters of the 19,145 genes expressed in
the brain were differentially expressed between the cerebel-
lum and any other brain regions, when each of the genes was
tested. Comparing the hypothalamus to the telencephalon
and to the tectum opticum resulted in 7,911 and 7,264 dif-
ferentially expressed genes, respectively, and 11,370 genes
were found to be differentially expressed between the tectum
opticum and the telencephalon. In the GO term analyses we
found that in the pair-wise comparisons of tectum opticum,
telencephalon, and hypothalamus no highly represented GO
category (in % sequences) appeared to be over- or under-
represented in the differentially expressed genes compared

correlation was detected between ratio of brain hemisphere volumes (left to right) and foraging laterality index [Spearmans’ rho (q) ¼ �0.394, N ¼ 27, P

the brain-structure level, only the tectum opticum showed a significant negative relationship (q ¼ �0.455, N ¼ 27, P ¼ 0.017).

 with the overall reference gene-set (supplementary fig. S3,
Supplementary Material online). Instead, most analyzed genes
were represented in many GO categories (included in the
“others” category). In contrast, when the tectum opticum
and the hypothalamus were individually compared with the
cerebellum, large percentages of the sequences were
assigned to three and two GO categories, respectively, with
different abundances between the candidate genes and the
reference (supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material on-
line). In both comparisons, genes associated with the GO cat-
egory “integral component of membrane” were over-
represented in the list of differentially expressed genes,
whereas the category “nucleus” was under-represented,
compared with the reference (supplementary fig. S3,
Supplementary Material online). Finally, a very large propor-
tion (�98%) of the GO terms assigned to the differentially
expressed genes between the telencephalon and the cerebel-
lum were represented by the 30 illustrated categories (supple
mentary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online).
We tested for differential gene expression between the left
and right hemispheres in the three paired brain regions.
Welch-ANOVA was performed if at least seven nonzero ex-
pression values were available for each hemisphere. Prior cor-
rection for multiple testing, we identified 367, 370, and 469
differentially expressed genes in the tectum opticum, telen-
cephalon, and hypothalamus, respectively. However, after
false discovery rate correction, none remained significant (all
P fdr > 0.05).
Gene Expression Patterns Reflecting Behavioral Laterality
For each gene and brain region, a linear model with FLI as an
independent variable and gene expression as a dependent
variable was calculated (linear model slope estimates irrespec-
tive of significance are shown in fig. 4A–C). For the three
paired brain regions examined, including tectum opticum, tel-
encephalon, and hypothalamus, we identified 140, 173, and
79 candidate genes, respectively, that showed a significant
linear relationship with the FLI and an intercept not different
from zero (table 2; supplementary table S4, Supplementary
Material online). Brain regions appeared to have different
biases on the direction of candidate gene slopes, that is,
whereas tectum opticum-specific candidate genes mostly
had a negative slope (i.e., are up-regulated in the brain hemi-
sphere facing the prey fish), candidate genes of the other two
brain regions showed the opposite trend (figs. 4D–F and 5).
This was particularly pronounced in the telencephalon, where
�85% of candidate genes had a positive slope, that is, the
genes were relatively up-regulated in the brain hemisphere
that did not face the side at which prey fish were preferred
(figs. 4E and 5). This unequal distribution of slope estimates
suggests that identified candidate genes are mostly not false
positives, which is why no post hoc correction was applied.
GO term analyses for biological processes suggest that
laterality candidate genes in each brain region show a differ-
ent composition of GO categories (fig. 6; GO term analyses
for “molecular function” and “cellular component”; see sup
plementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online). Notably,
the laterality candidate genes of the hypothalamus were
assigned to a more diverse set of GO categories (N ¼ 26)
than those of the tectum opticum (13) or the telencephalon
(13) (this trend was also found if equal numbers of candidate
genes per brain region were analyzed).
Discussion
The laterality (handedness) of the foraging behavior associ-
ated with an asymmetry in head morphology has made the
scale-eating cichlid fish, Perissodus microlepis, from Lake
Tanganyika a textbook case of the extraordinary degree of
ecological adaptations (or trophic specialization) as well as for
negative frequency-dependent selection (Hori 1993; Alcock
2009; Futuyma 2009) (see fig. 1A and B). However, the mo-
lecular basis or neuro-molecular mechanisms of the pro-
nounced behavioral laterality in P. microlepis remained

 unexplored so far. Linking asymmetric gene expression in the
brain to its functional significance, for example, lateralized
behavior, has rarely been investigated and the focus of previ-
ous work remains exclusively on humans (Sun et al. 2005;
Francks et al. 2007; Johnson et al. 2009; but see Nadler
et al. 2006; deCarvalho et al. 2014). To our knowledge, this
is the first study to link behavioral laterality to left-right asym-
metry in gene expression in different brain regions as well as
to neuroanatomical asymmetry, that is, the size differences
between the left and right hemispheres.
Our results show that the degree of lateralized behavior in
P. microlepis reflects the anatomical size differences between
the left and right hemispheric regions in the brain, particularly
in the visual center of the brain, the tectum opticum. This
paired brain region, which belongs to the mesencephalon,
is central in processing visual information and signaling stimuli
to other brain regions and motor-neurons (Hubel and Wiesel
1962), involving prey-catching behavior (“orientation toward
prey behavior”) as documented in salamanders (Himstedt and
Roth 1980) and fishes (Al-Akel et al. 1986; Gahtan et al.
2005). It is important to note that, as was shown for other
vertebrates, fish brain hemispheres typically control the
opposite sides of the individual’s body, that is, the right
tectum opticum processes incoming visual information

genes had a positive model slope, that is, were relatively down-regulated in the brain side facing the prey. (F) Fewest candidate genes were detected in the
hypothalamus, in which slightly more genes had a positive slope than a negative slope.

 from the left eye and the left tectum opticum from the
right eye via the chiasmus opticum (fig. 1C and D). In fish
with strong behavioral laterality, we showed that the tec-
tum opticum hemisphere that is processing the data from
the eye that is facing towards the prey during an attack is
significantly larger in volume than its counterpart (fig. 2B).
In fish with weak behavioral laterality this effect of neuro-
anatomical left-right asymmetry was not present. These
findings are consistent with the patterns previously found
in pigeons that the right eye is dominant over the left and
accordingly the left hemisphere of their tectum opticum is
increased in size (Gu
¨ ntu
¨ rku
¨ n 1997). Our results thus indi-
cate that although the extent of lateralization in behavior
varies among individuals, its occurrence may be deter-
mined by differences in symmetry of some neuroanatom-
ical regions. This finding also supports the notion that the
neurologically more dominant side of the body may be
orchestrated by the relatively larger corresponding brain
hemisphere (on the contralateral side).
Genome-wide transcriptional profiles of four brain regions
analyzed in this study reveal that different brain regions have
distinct transcriptional profiles (fig. 3). These results agree with
previous findings of regionally specific gene expression pat-
terns in adult mice brain (Nadler et al. 2006; Lein et al. 2007)
and also in adult human brain (Hawrylycz et al. 2012).
Notably, the cerebellum appears to be transcriptionally the
most divergent from the other three brain parts (separated
from the others by PC1) as shown for adult mice brain (Nadler
et al. 2006), followed by the tectum opticum (separated from
the others by PC2) and finally the telencephalon and the hy-
pothalamus appear to be transcriptionally most similar (sepa-
rated from each other only by PC3). This order corresponds
well to their developmental Bauplan and interrelationships,
with the telencephalon (most anterior) and the hypothalamus
(second most anterior) both being components of the pros-
encephalon (forebrain), followed by the tectum opticum in
the mesencephalon (midbrain) and the cerebellum, a part of
the rhombencephalon (hindbrain; figs. 1 and 5). These results

 are consistent with those of previous studies that found that
gene expression differences across brain regions recapitulated
the developmental processes of the embryonic brain in adult
mice based on their cluster analyses (Zapala et al. 2005;
Nadler et al. 2006). Likewise, we find a higher number of
differentially expressed genes between the cerebellum and
any other brain regions, and relatively fewer between the
telencephalon and the hypothalamus. The GO enrichment
tests on the differentially expressed genes support the tran-
scriptionally distinct position of the cerebellum: comparisons
within and between prosencephalic and mesencephalic brain
regions resulted in many differentially represented GO cate-
gories with each representing only a small fraction of differ-
entially
expressed
genes
(supplementary
fig.
S3,
Supplementary Material online). However, when the other
brain regions are compared with the cerebellum, fewer
major “biological process”-GO categories cover most dif-
ferentially expressed genes, suggesting that the cerebel-
lum is most different from the other brain regions, for
example, by substantially differing from each other in
genes relating to “integral components of cell mem-
branes”, such as ion channel genes.
A central goal of this study was to determine candidate
genes that relate to behavioral laterality and we identified
genes potentially underpinning behavioral laterality in all three
paired brain regions. For the tectum opticum, we found ex-
pression differences in 140 genes between the left and right
hemispheres that could be related to behavioral lateralization
(supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online). The
most significant and promising candidate is synuclein gamma
(sncga) and is discussed below in more detail. Besides sncga,
we identified paralogs of other putatively asymmetrically
expressed neurotransmitters, such as numerous members of
the solute carrier family as well as the glutamate metabotropic
receptor family (their functions are summarized in deCarvalho
et al. 2014; Karlebach and Francks 2015).
The function of the telencephalon and its role in behaviors
in teleost fishes remain largely unstudied. The telencephalon,
known as the cognitive center of the vertebrate brain, is
thought to be involved in processing all sensory information
especially olfactory signals coming from the olfactory bulbs,
learning, directing active movements and social-reproductive
behaviors (Overmier and Patten 1982; Butler and Hodos
2005). Lesion studies have suggested that the telencephalon
of the teleost fish plays a role in spatial learning and memory
(Kaplan and Aronson 1967; reviewed in Salas et al. 2006). We
identified a pronounced bias in the slope of candidate genes
relating to lateralized feeding behavior in P. microlepis, indi-
cating that �85% of these genes are up-regulated in the
telencephalon hemisphere away from prey fish and thus pu-
tatively controlling the body side of the scale-eater facing the
prey fish. Among these telencephalic candidate genes, inter-
estingly, we found mgrn1b that has been shown to crucially
affect left-right patterning in mice and that is important for
proper neuronal development (Cota et al. 2006). Lrrtm1, an-
other candidate gene, has been suggested to be related to
handedness and schizophrenia in humans (Francks et al.
2007). Changes in the expression of the telencephalic candi-
date kcng3, a gene coding for a potassium channel subunit,
might be related to handedness, as changes in the closely
related kcns3 have been suggested to be related to schizo-
phrenia in humans (Georgiev et al. 2014). Schizophrenia is,
interestingly, a condition that is associated with reduced brain
lateralization
and
handedness
(Sommer
et
al.
2001).
Expression of two protocadherins (pcdh1b and pcdh17) was
found to be significantly associated with lateralized behavior,

larger the hemisphere of the tectum opticum (TEC) that is processing the
information of the body side facing the prey fish. Expression differences in
the candidate genes between brain hemisphere regions were increased
with increasing behavioral laterality. However, the direction of up- (þ) or
down- (�) regulation in candidate genes showed divergent biases among
the brain regions as illustrated. In the telencephalon (TEL), �85% of can-
didate genes showed an increase in the hemisphere fold-change with an
increasing feeding laterality index (FLI), that is, most genes were relatively
up-regulated in the brain hemisphere not facing the prey fish. This trend
was less pronounced in the hypothalamus (HYP) where only �60% of
genes were relatively upregulated in the same hemisphere and was
completely reversed in the tectum opticum (TEC) where most genes
were relatively up-regulated in the hemisphere facing the prey fish.

 cadm1b, cadpsb, grm2, and kctd2, which themselves or their
paralogs have been reported to be expressed asymmetrically
in
the
brain
of
zebrafish
(deCarvalho
et
al.
2014).
Interestingly, grm2, that had a significant negative slope in
the tectum opticum, had a positive slope in the telencepha-
lon. It thus exemplifies the overall inversion of slope biases
that we observed between the two brain regions (figs. 4
and 5) that may be due to the circumstance that the tectum
opticum is processing visual signals from the eye of the op-
posite body side while the telencephalon processes olfactory
signals from the same body side.
The smallest number of candidate genes with the most
subtle slope biase were detected in the hypothalamus, the
brain region that lies ventrally, and developmentally between
the tectum opticum and the telencephalon. Identified candi-
date genes include smad2, which is crucial in early embryonic
development of asymmetric structures (Tremblay et al. 2000)
and members of the solute carrier family (slc7a6, slc23a1, and
slc33a1). In general, the hypothalamus shows the least asym-
metry in gene expression in the paired brain regions that we
analyzed.
Highlighting our overall evidence, we found strong support
for behavioral laterality represented in the tectum opticum by
its neuroanatomical and transcriptional asymmetries, as our
results show a left-right size difference and also a pronounced
bias in the linear model slopes in this particular brain region.
The tectum opticum-specific candidate genes appear to be
downregulated in the brain hemisphere that controls the
body side facing the prey fish during an attack—the opposite
trend we find in the telencephalon (fig. 5). Although the tec-
tum opticum is processing signals from the eye on the oppo-
site side of the body, the telencephalon processes information
from the olfactory sensors on the same body side. These two
findings combined may explain the inverted biases of gene
expression patterns between these two brain regions (figs. 4
and 5). The hypothalamus is a part of the diencephalon,
which is thought to be the most complex region of the teleost
brain (Cerd�
a-Reverter et al. 2001). Among other functions, it
processes information of gustatory information, vision, olfac-
tion and reproduction (Braford and Northcutt1983; Northcutt
and Wullimann 1988; Wullimann 1997). The neuroanatomi-
cal and functional diversities of the hypothalamus is probably
also reflected in the most diverse set of GO terms that devi-
ated from the reference set (fig. 6).
One of the exciting findings in our study is the highly sig-
nificant correlation between the degree of asymmetrical ex-
pression in sncga and that of behavioral lateralization. sncga
belongs to a group of soluble proteins (synucleins) that act as
neurotransmitters and are commonly expressed in neural tis-
sues; however, sncga is typically expressed in peripheral neu-
rons and the retina (George 2002). In zebrafish, sncga was
found to be asymmetrically expressed in the habenular
nuclei—a diencephalic complex that has been shown to be
involved in motor behaviors and the motivation to exhibit
them, and that is thought to be a hub for asymmetry in the
vertebrate brain (Bianco and Wilson 2009; Chen et al. 2009;
Ichijo et al. 2017). Specifically, habenular nuclei are shown to
signal motor neurons and interact with the dopaminergic
FIG. 6.—Gene ontology (GO) term analysis on biological processes of all genes (A) pooled across all four brain regions, and on genes with a linear
relationship to behavioral laterality in the paired (B) tectum opticum, (C) telencephalon, and (D) hypothalamus. GO term composition suggests that laterality
candidate genes belong to different biological processes and their composition is brain region specific.

 system, potentially leading to behavioral side preferences
(reviewed in Bianco and Wilson 2009; Gutie
´rrez-Ib�
a~
nez
et al. 2011; as suggested for P. microlepis by Ichijo et al.
2017). This is an exciting hypothesis that deserves further
studies.
The causal relationships leading to the lateralized behav-
ioral phenotypes in P. microlepis may be critically influenced
by the brain anatomical and transcriptional asymmetries that
we identified. Fish with structural and functional asymmetries
likely controlled by a genetic component (Ichijo et al. 2017)
may be stimulated to exhibit lateralized behaviors, such as
feeding. Lateralized foraging behavior finally may lead to plas-
tic changes in the oral jaw phenotype in P. microlepis (Van
Dooren et al. 2010; Palmer 2012; Lee et al. 2012). Phenotypic
plasticity has been shown to be a prominent feature of many
cichlid fishes (e.g., Meyer 1987; Klingenberg et al. 2003;
Muschick et al. 2011; Schneider and Meyer 2017) possibly
as a developmental basis for both the diversity of jaw shapes
and the lateralized jaws for which this species is renowned.
However, previous studies seemed to show that the jaw lat-
erality is already present in P. microlepis fry before they start
actively to feed, arguing against plasticity (Hori 1993; Stewart
and Albertson 2010). Our more recent studies reconciled the
disputed mechanisms for morphological asymmetry where
not only genes, but also environmental effects appear to be
responsible for the observed variation in this trait (Lee et al.
2015; Raffini et al. 2016). To more fully resolve this issue,
time-course studies investigating both morphological asym-
metries in the jaw and the brain as well as differential gene
expression in the brain starting at the earliest possible time-
point and covering the time until clear feeding preferences
(e.g., at an age of 2-months; Lee et al. 2012) would be nec-
essary. Such studies would allow to determine the develop-
mental sequence of asymmetry in the jaw and brain, and also
behavior (Ichijo et al. 2017).
Some of our earlier work (Lee et al. 2012) and results from
the current analysis suggest that behavioral laterality may oc-
cur earlier than morphological laterality in the jaw or that both
may emerge independently, given only a weak correlation
between mouth asymmetry and behavioral laterality in
“laboratory-reared” scale-eating cichlids. We also found
that in laboratory-reared juvenile fish (e.g., at an age of 2-
months) that had been raised on Artemia nauplii and flake
food, the degree of mouth asymmetry was relatively small
based on our quantitative measurements, although we could
document an early strong laterality in behavioral preference
when feeding on scales (Lee et al. 2012). These findings sug-
gest that lateralized foraging behavior might precede and
“guide” morphological asymmetry via plasticity. A central
question that follow-up studies should thus ask is how
strongly behavioral laterality is genetically determined (and
heritable). Whether the asymmetry of brain regions, particu-
larly tectum opticum (as shown in this study) is a direct con-
sequence of genes that cause lateralized behaviors or
whether these brain regions respond to lateralized behaviors
secondarily remains unclear. However, the former scenario is
more plausible, given that the test fish used for brain anatom-
ical and transcriptional asymmetries analyzed here had not
had an opportunity to feed on scales from prey fish before.
Perissodus microlepis is an evolutionary text-book example
of negative frequency-dependent selection due to its iconic
mouth asymmetry and feeding laterality. Despite prior efforts
to elucidate the genetic or environmental bases of morpho-
logical mouth asymmetry (e.g., Lee et al. 2015; Raffini et al.
2016), relatively little attention had been paid to the molecu-
lar basis of behavioral laterality so far. In this study we show
that feeding laterality in P. microlepis is reflected in its neuro-
anatomy, particularly in the tectum opticum. Transcriptional
profiles further suggest that in both the tectum opticum and
telencephalon, gene expressions are also lateralized, and that
these gene expression lateralities are likely to be causally
linked to behavioral laterality. Given the observed neuro-
molecular basis of behavioral laterality, the next work needs
to focus on functional tests for the proposed causal relation-
ships and on the heritability of the neuroanatomical and tran-
scriptional asymmetries.
