Dear Friends and Colleagues:
It is a pleasure to share the 2015 Patient Registry Annual Data Report with you. The impact of the Cystic 
Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry continues to grow and inform many important initiatives, including: 
quality improvement, clinical trial design, “real world” observational research, and safety and effectiveness 
studies of newly approved therapies.
I call your attention to a recent publication, “Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry: Design and 
Methods of a National Observational Disease Registry,”1 which describes the history of the CF Foundation 
Patient Registry from its inception in the 1960’s to the present, the patient population, and the methods 
for collection, security, and processing of the data. Of note, the journal editor commented: “The article 
this month by Knapp and colleagues features one of the most fully developed disease registries in all 
of medicine. The current publication offers a benchmark and roadmap for the development of other 
observational patient registries.”
I hope that all of you are proud of your contributions to the tremendous success of the registry.  
It would not be possible without the vital contributions of many, most notably the individuals with CF 
and their families who generously agree to share their data and the Registry coordinators and care team 
members who collect and enter the data. The audit studies confirm the high degree of completeness 
and accuracy of the Registry data. We are deeply grateful to all who have helped make the Registry an 
indispensable tool in our shared endeavors to help those with CF enjoy the best health and quality of life.
This year’s report includes an update to the survival section and information on the uptake of CFTR 
modulators (over 5,500 people with CF in the registry were prescribed a CFTR modulator in 2015). 
In addition, we continue to see the year-over-year incremental improvements in key metrics such as 
pulmonary function and nutritional status that bode well for the future. 
We hope you find this report interesting and that it sparks discussions among members of the CF 
community. As always we are open to your comments and suggestions for improvement.
This is a truly exciting time in CF
, with advances in health care delivery and new therapeutics that have 
transformative potential. Together, we will track these and other important developments in the Registry.
Thank you all for your hard work throughout the year and your commitment to the CF Foundation’s mission.

DEMOGRAPHICS
The Registry contains data on people with CF from 1986 to 2015. During that time, 
substantial changes in specialized CF care have led to improved survival. This section 
shows the current and longitudinal distribution of demographic characteristics of 
individuals with CF in the Registry. 
In 2015, there were 28,983 individuals with CF in the Registry. The number of adults with 
CF continues to increase, while the number of children has remained relatively stable.  
In 2015, adults constituted 51.6 percent of the CF population, compared with 29.2 percent 
in 1986. 
The decrease in the number of individuals in 2003 is due to a delay in obtaining informed consent forms before the close of the calendar 
year at some CF care centers.

Currently, 8.5 percent of the individuals in the Registry have reported as Hispanic. There has been 
a steady increase over the past 15 years, reflecting national population trends.4 Hispanics with CF 
tend to be younger than the overall CF population, with a median age of 12.8 years.
The median age of people with CF currently in the Registry is 18.6 years. The range is from 
birth to 87.2 years. Despite gains in survival, the age distribution remains markedly skewed 
toward younger ages.
Throughout this report, there are a number of age distribution charts used to display 
particular characteristics of individuals in the Registry. Each of these charts will include the 
grey bars seen in the chart above to display the total number of individuals in the Registry in 
2015. More information on these charts is available in the Appendix.

Characteristics of Adults with CF
As a growing number of individuals with CF enter adulthood, it is encouraging to note that 
many are pursuing higher education and employment, and are in committed relationships 
and having children of their own. About two-thirds of adults with CF are either studying or 
working.

Since 1994, the percentage of adults with CF who report being married or living with a partner 
has increased by almost 10 percentage points. About 37 percent of adults in the Registry are 
college graduates, representing an increase of almost 10 percentage points.
The number of pregnancies among women with CF has increased steadily since the 1990s. 
Registry data show that 235 women with CF were pregnant in 2015. The overall pregnancy 
rate among women with CF has remained relatively constant, in contrast to the pregnancy rate 
in the general U.S. population, which has declined during this time.5

Health Insurance Information
Access to insurance coverage for specialized care and treatments is a challenge for some 
individuals with CF. About half of the individuals in all age groups in the Registry receive at 
least some component of their health insurance through federal or state-funded programs. 
Registry data show that in 2015 a majority of people with CF who were age 18 to 25 
received health insurance through their parents’ plan. 
“Insurance coverage” reflects coverage at any point during the year, thus these categories are not mutually 
exclusive (except for the “no health insurance” option).
“Patient assistance program” refers to any program that provides free medication or co-pay assistance.
 
A large proportion of children with CF use Medicaid or state programs, including 57 percent 
of children under age 10. Though the overall prevalence of Medicare use is low, the program 
covers between 20 and 40 percent of adults age 30 to 65. Individuals under age 65 who 
receive Medicare have met the federal criteria for disability.

DIAGNOSIS
Characteristics of Diagnoses among Individuals with CF
This section examines characteristics of individuals diagnosed with CF
, as well as trends 
over time for two key diagnostic tests: genotyping and sweat test.
In 2015, 59.6 percent of new diagnoses were detected by newborn screening (NBS). There is 
evidence that individuals diagnosed prior to the onset of symptoms have better lung function 
and nutritional outcomes later in life.6 Diagnosis in the newborn period also represents 
an important opportunity for CF care centers to partner with community physicians and 
families to ensure the best possible care and outcomes for infants with CF.
The implementation of a screening program is typically associated with an increase in the number 
of newly diagnosed individuals. This is known as lead time bias since individuals who would have 
presented with symptoms later in life are detected earlier by a screening program. Thus, lead time 
bias is potentially the explanation for the increase in new cases during 2005-2010. In recent years, 
we see a decrease in the number of individuals newly diagnosed with CF
. Some of the decrease 
observed in 2015 is the result of infants born late in 2015 who were not seen at a CF care center 
before the close of the reporting year; therefore, their data are not yet included in the Registry. 
Future reports will be adjusted to include these individuals for the 2015 diagnosis year.
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene was discovered 
in 1989. According to CF Foundation guidelines, infants with a positive NBS who have 
inconclusive sweat test results and/or less than two CF-causing genetic mutations should 
be diagnosed with CFTR-related metabolic syndrome7 (CRMS). CRMS was added to the 
Registry as a diagnostic option in 2010. 
In 2015, data were entered for 614 individuals diagnosed with CRMS, 87 of whom were given 
this diagnosis during 2015. Entry of a diagnosis of CF versus CRMS into the Registry is a clinical 
decision; there is no validation that individuals meet published diagnostic criteria for CF or

CRMS. A comparison of clinical diagnoses of CF and CRMS in 2010 and 2011 showed that 
41 percent of infants (n=126) who met the published diagnostic criteria for CRMS were entered 
into the Registry with a diagnosis of CF
.8 Analyses involving this cohort of people with CF must 
account for this misclassification. 
In addition to CRMS, individuals can be diagnosed with a CFTR-related disorder. This 
option has been available in the Registry since 2010. Individuals with this diagnosis do not 
meet diagnostic criteria for CF or CRMS but are affected by CF-related conditions such as 
congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) and often have mutations in the 
CFTR gene.9 Collection and analysis of data from these individuals will provide new and 
important information for these distinct populations.
 
In 2015, 613 newborn infants were diagnosed with CF. Of those with a known gestational 
age at birth, 87.4 percent were born full term, comparable with the figure for the general U.S. 
population.10 The mean birth weight for full-term infants with CF is also about the same as 
for the U.S. population,11 suggesting that infants  with CF do not initially show nutritional 
deficiencies. The graph does not include the 109 infants who were born and diagnosed with CF 
in 2015 who did not have a gestational age recorded in the Registry (17.8 percent).
    
“Preterm” refers to infants born at a gestational age less than 37 weeks. “Full term” refers to infants born at a 
gestational age greater than or equal to 37 weeks.

The majority of those diagnosed in their first year are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic 
at time of diagnosis. Among the 13.3 percent of infants diagnosed in 2015 under age 1 with 
meconium ileus (or other intestinal obstruction), 31.7 percent had bowel perforation. Those 
diagnosed after age 1 often present with acute or persistent respiratory abnormalities.

Diagnostic Tests
Sweat Chloride Testing
Sweat chloride testing is an important diagnostic test recommended for all individuals regardless 
of genotype.12 In 2015, 86.4 percent of individuals in the Registry had a sweat chloride test 
result recorded. The downward trend in the reporting of sweat chloride test results through the 
1990s and early 2000s appears to have plateaued. Individuals who are homozygous for F508del, 
the most common CF-causing genetic mutation, are less likely to have sweat chloride values in 
the Registry than those with other mutations. Baseline sweat chloride tests are becoming more 
important as changes in sweat chloride are now viewed as indicators of the physiological effects of 
CFTR modulators.

Individuals may have two F508del mutations (homozygous), one F508del mutation 
(heterozygous) or no F508del mutations. Median sweat chloride test results remain consistent for 
individuals who are F508del homozygous. In contrast, there has been a steady decline in median 
sweat chloride values among individuals who are not homozygous for F508del, suggesting that 
more individuals with “less severe” genotypes are being entered into the Registry.
Genotyping
The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and the most 
prevalent CF causing mutation (F508del) were discovered in 1989. Since then, genotyping 
has been a key component of the diagnostic work-up. In addition, with the introduction 
of CFTR modulators, genotyping all people with CF is increasingly important to research 
and clinical care. In 2015, 97.8 percent of individuals (n=28,341) in the Registry had been 
genotyped. Among those, 5.1 percent have one or more alleles entered as “Unknown.”
Some individuals diagnosed in 2015 may not have had a sweat chloride test result entered in the Registry before the close of the reporting year.

CFTR GENE MUTATIONS    
To date, more than 1,800 mutations have been found in the CFTR gene.13 Some 
mutations result in virtually no CFTR function and others are associated with some 
residual function. To help categorize CF disease-causing mutations on the basis 
of their resulting functional impact, researchers have created five classes.14-16 This 
classification schema is an oversimplification as some mutations lead to more than one 
defect in CFTR function. For example, the R117H mutation results in both gating and 
conductance defects in CFTR. In addition, functional status has not been determined for 
all mutations. As a result, we use the term “class not identified” to refer to individuals 
who have been diagnosed with CF and genotyped but have one or more mutations 
whose functional consequences have not yet been determined.

The most common CFTR mutation is F508del: 86.4 percent of individuals in the Registry 
have at least one copy of this mutation. There is a substantial drop in prevalence from 
F508del to the next most common mutations. No other mutation is currently found in more 
than 5 percent of the population with CF.

Since F508del is the most common mutation, we examined the distribution of individuals 
by age and F508del status: two F508del mutations (homozygote), one F508del mutation 
(heterozygote) or no F508del mutations. A decrease in the proportion of F508del homozygotes 
in older age groups is likely due to a survivor bias for individuals with “milder” genotypes. Late 
diagnosis of individuals with “milder” genotypes may also contribute to this trend.
Among less common mutations, the number of individuals with an R117H mutation has 
increased over the years. Among those genotyped in 1993, less than 1 percent had an R117H 
mutation, compared with almost 5 percent of those genotyped in 2015. This may be due to the 
inclusion of R117H in newborn screening algorithms. Of note, 84 (10.3%) of the 816 individuals 
with an R117H mutation and CF diagnosis had a sweat chloride value less than 30 mmol/L.
The clinical significance of the R117H mutation depends in part on the poly-T tract variant 
on the chromosome. Research indicates that a shorter poly-T tract is associated with a higher 
likelihood of having CF
.17, 18 Unfortunately, the Registry has incomplete information on the 
poly-T tract for the majority of individuals diagnosed with CF with the R117H mutation.

Throughout this report, we use mutation class categories. Individuals with two mutations 
in classes I, II or III are grouped together because these mutations typically lead to little or 
no CFTR function. Individuals with one or two mutations in classes IV or V are grouped 
together because these mutations are typically associated with residual CFTR function. 
Research has shown that this grouping of classes is associated with meaningful clinical 
differences between the groups.14, 16
The majority of children and young adults with CF have genetic mutations in classes  
I-III. The number and proportion of individuals in this group decreases in older ages. 
Conversely, we see a greater number of individuals with genotypes in classes IV-V who  
are under age 10, and older ages. This is likely due to the implementation of NBS and 
survivor bias, respectively. 
Of all individuals who were genotyped, 71.2 percent were classified in the class I-III group, 
10.9 percent were classified in the class IV-V group and 17.9 percent could not be classified. As 
expected, individuals in the class I-III group are younger and are more likely to be prescribed 
pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (98.6 percent of whom are taking PERT) than 
individuals with a mutation in the class IV-V group (38.2 percent of whom are taking PERT).

GUIDELINES: CARE, SCREENING AND PREVENTION
The CF Foundation has developed clinical practice guidelines for routine care and screening 
for individuals with CF during infancy, childhood and adulthood.19-21 In accordance with 
guidelines for people with CF over age six,20, 21 many CF care centers report four office visits, 
two pulmonary function tests and at least one microbiology culture annually for the majority 
of their CF patients. Similarly, among children age 2 to 5, the majority have at least four visits 
and at least one culture. 
However, adherence to the recommendation that CF care centers perform quarterly respiratory 
cultures continues to be lower and more variable across the CF care center network.22 CF care 
centers report that respiratory therapists/physical therapists, dietitians/nutritionists and social 
workers evaluate most of their patients at least once per year, as recommended.23
There is significant variation by CF care center in several key screening measures, including 
measurement of immunoglobulin E (IgE) for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) 
and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan for osteopenia/osteoporosis. The influenza 
vaccination rate for people with CF age 6 months and older remains high across the CF care 
center network. Smoking and secondhand smoke exposure remain challenges, particularly for 
infants and young adults.
Patient Care Guidelines
The percentage of individuals receiving care that meets CF Foundation care guidelines has 
increased in recent years. Because individuals should be able to perform reliable pulmonary 
function tests (PFTs) at age 6 and older, we use guidelines criteria for those age 7 and older to 
ensure that individuals were eligible to perform a reliable PFT for the entire year.
Over the past decade, the number of children and adults receiving at a minimum the 
recommended four visits, four respiratory cultures and two PFTs has doubled.21, 22 The percentage 
of adults who receive care that meets guidelines criteria remains lower than that observed in 
children. However, over half of adults are being seen at least four times, complete two or more 
PFTs and are cultured at least once during the year.

The guidelines on infection prevention and control recommend that individuals with CF 
have quarterly respiratory cultures.22, 24 Nearly 98 percent of individuals received at least one 
culture in 2015, and 54.9 percent of individuals had four or more respiratory cultures. Those 
under age 18 were more likely to meet the recommendation for four cultures. 
The multidisciplinary care team plays an important role in CF care. Over time, there has 
been an increase in the number of individuals with CF who receive at least an annual 
evaluation from their respiratory therapist, dietitian and social worker. In 2015, 70.9 percent 
of individuals were evaluated by all three specialists.

The CF Foundation’s consensus statement on ABPA recommends screening individuals 6 
years and older for ABPA by annual measurement of total serum IgE concentration.25
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices recommends influenza vaccination for all individuals with CF age 6 months and 
older.26 The influenza vaccination rate of people with CF 6 months and older is about 75 
percent of the total population and 90 percent of those with a known vaccination status 
(excluding the 16 percent with unknown status).

The CF Foundation consensus statement on bone health and disease recommends screening all 
adults with CF with a DXA scan and subsequent follow-up based on the findings of the baseline 
scan.27 Annual screenings are recommended only for individuals with DXA z-scores that are lower 
than two standard deviations below the mean, with less frequent screening recommended for 
those with higher values. Therefore, in the figure below we group five years of data. 
CF Foundation guidelines recommend annual measurement of fat-soluble vitamins to screen for 
vitamin deficiency.21, 28 The CF Foundation Hepatobiliary Disease Consensus Group recommends 
a yearly panel of liver blood tests for all people with CF to screen for possible liver disease. 
Registry data suggest that these tests are being done on the majority of individuals.29
In 2015, the CF Foundation and the European CF Society jointly released the first guidelines on 
screening for depression and anxiety among individuals with CF and caregivers of children with CF
. 
Annual screening is recommended for all individuals with CF who are age 12 and older, as well as 
caregivers of children with CF. The chart below shows some preliminary data from 2015, the first 
year that data on screening of individuals with CF were collected in the Registry. There is currently 
wide variation in screening across the CF care center network, with more screening for depression 
than for anxiety. Data on caregiver screening are not included in the Registry at this time.
Includes any DXA scans performed during 2011–2015. Previously, we reported the percentage that had a DXA scan within the Registry 
reporting year.

Of additional concern for individuals with CF is exposure to tobacco smoke. In 2015, 21.8 
percent of individuals with CF reported monthly or more frequent exposure to tobacco 
smoke, either secondhand or as a smoker. Exposure to tobacco smoke is a substantial 
problem that causes disease and premature death in children and adults.30 Cigarette smoking 
prevalence is lower in the CF population than in the general U.S. population — only 
3.4 percent of adults with CF are smokers, compared with 16.8 percent in the general 
population in 2014.31 However, smoking and secondhand smoke exposure remain significant 
concerns, especially for infants and young adults. Smoke exposure was unknown for 38.4 
percent of individuals with CF, who were excluded from the analyses.

Infant Care Guidelines
The CF Foundation guidelines for diagnosis of CF recommend that infants with a positive 
newborn screen undergo a sweat chloride test. It is important to make a definitive diagnosis as 
quickly as possible so families can be educated about the disease and treatment can be started.6
The CF Foundation infant care guidelines recommend monthly CF care center visits during 
the first 6 months of life and every 1 to 2 months in the second 6 months.6 Therefore, we 
expect infants with CF, detected by NBS, to have 9 to 12 visits in the first year of life. There 
is marked variation in the number of encounters for individuals in the first year of life across 
the CF care center network.
The chart shows data for children born in 2014 because a full year of data is available for these individuals. Median time to first sweat 
test for these individuals is 30 days. In 2014, 77 infants (13.2 percent) who were detected by NBS did not have a sweat chloride test 
reported to the Registry by the end of 2015 and thus are not included in this analysis.

Respiratory cultures are being collected at the majority of clinic visits for infants with CF
. 
Guidelines recommend that cultures be performed at least quarterly during the first 2 years of life.6 
The chart shows data for children born in 2014 because a full year of data is available for these individuals. The median number of 
cultures is five. 
The chart shows data for children born in 2014 because a full year of data is available for these individuals. The median number of visits

Fecal elastase testing, which provides an objective measure of pancreatic function, is 
recommended in the infant care guidelines.6 There is marked variation in the use of this 
test across the CF care center network. The guidelines also recommend that infants begin 
salt supplementation after diagnosis, and this is widely followed across the CF care center 
network. We observe substantial variation in the utilization of palivizumab (respiratory 
syncytial virus, or RSV, prophylaxis) with a downward trend since 2008. The current 
American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation is that palivizumab should not be 
routinely used in individuals with CF. The CF Foundation infant care guidelines recommend 
that its use be considered for infants with CF.6 Nearly all CF care centers are prescribing the 
therapy for some infants with decreased use in recent years.

MICROBIOLOGY
Bronchiectasis with chronic pulmonary infections represents a serious problem for most 
individuals with CF
. This section provides information on trends in CF pathogens over 
time and by age group. Updated infection prevention and control guidelines provide 
current best practices for reducing exposure to CF pathogens in the health care setting 
and in everyday life.24
 
The prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P
. aeruginosa or PA) continues to decrease. This 
may in part relate to widespread implementation of therapy to eradicate initial acquisition.24, 32
Some of the increase in Staphylococcus aureus may be due to improved microbiologic practices 
for detection of Gram-positive organisms. From 2000 to 2015, there was about a five-fold 
increase in the numbers of individuals with CF with a culture positive for MRSA. Since 
2010, prevalence appears to have plateaued. Research has shown that about two-thirds of 
individuals with MRSA had strains associated with hospital-acquired infections while  
one-third had strains associated with community-acquired infections.33-35 The stabilization of 
prevalence is potentially due to increased awareness and infection prevention and  
control strategies.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa
The percentage of individuals who cultured positive for P
. aeruginosa has continued to decline 
over time, with the largest decrease observed among individuals younger than 18 years (50.7 
percent had a positive culture in 1995 compared with 30.4 percent in 2015). Many individuals 
with CF now transition to adult care without P
. aeruginosa in their respiratory tract.
Rates of multidrug-resistant P
. aeruginosa (MDR-PA) infection are most notable in older 
adolescents and adults with CF. These findings likely reflect cumulative exposure to 
antibiotics. The clinical significance of this drug resistance is unclear. In 2015, 9.2 percent 
of individuals with a bacterial culture were reported to have MDR-PA and 19.4 percent of 
individuals with a P
. aeruginosa infection were reported to have MDR-PA.
Researchers have developed a classification system, known as the Leeds criteria, to categorize 
individuals on the basis of P
. aeruginosa  infection status. The categories are “never having 
a positive P
. aeruginosa  culture,” “free of a positive P
. aeruginosa  culture in the past 12 
months,” “intermittent infection” (less than 50 percent of their cultures in the past year were 
positive for P
. aeruginosa ) and “chronic infection” (more than 50 percent of their cultures 
in the past year were positive for P
. aeruginosa ). In 2015, 18 percent of individuals in the 
Registry had never had a positive culture for P
. aeruginosa . In addition, another 29 percent of 
individuals had cultures that were negative for P
. aeruginosa  during the entire calendar year 
but had a positive culture in a previous year. Some 47 percent of individuals had at least one 
positive culture in 2015, of which 30 percent were categorized as having chronic infection, 
and 17 percent as having intermittent infection. 
Multidrug resistance is defined as resistance to all antibiotics tested in two or more classes in a single culture.

Burkholderia cepacia complex
In 2015, 664 people with CF had a culture positive for Burkholderia cepacia (B. cepacia) 
complex: 93.6 percent of those isolates were confirmed at the CF Foundation B. cepacia 
Research Laboratory and Repository at the University of Michigan.
Nontuberculous Mycobacteria
The prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) infections is increasing in the 
general population.36 Since 2010, the Registry has collected more robust information on 
mycobacterial cultures and NTM infections. 
The CF Foundation/European Cystic Fibrosis Society Guidelines recommend that 
individuals with CF who are able to expectorate be cultured for NTM infections annually.37 
Individuals should also be screened before and six months after beginning azithromycin 
and annually thereafter.3 The data show improvement in screening rates over time, but wide 
variation by CF care center persists in these measures.
Data are not mutually exclusive. Some individuals had more than one species isolated in 2015. Note that B. gladioli is not part of the  
B. cepacia complex. Due to changes in data processing the values are higher than those reported in 2014 and earlier. However, there is no 
significant increase in the prevalence of Burkholderia species in the CF population.

A throat swab is insufficient for a mycobacterial culture, so a patient must be able to produce 
sputum in order for this culture to be performed. As shown in the chart below, a majority 
(71.1%) of the individuals who produced a sputum culture for a bacterial culture also had a 
mycobacterial culture performed during the year.
Of the 14,225 individuals who had a mycobacterial culture performed in 2015, 1,692 (11.9 
percent) had a mycobacterial species isolated one or more times. The relative proportion of 
M. abscessus isolated in 2015 is higher than reported over a decade ago in a CF Foundation-
supported multicenter prevalence study.38
Because individuals may not have a mycobacterial culture each year, data from 2011 to 2015 
were combined to allow a more robust analysis of mycobacterial species prevalence among 
people with CF. Among the 21,898 individuals who were cultured in this time period, 4,161 
had one or more mycobacterial species isolated (19.0 percent).
Data are not mutually exclusive. Some individuals have more than one species.

The charts below show the population-level variation in each age group for World Health 
Organization (WHO) weight-for-length, weight percentile and height percentiles in three 
groups: all individuals, those in mutation class I-III, and those in classes IV-V. All three 
groups show a median weight-for-length value well above the 50th percentile; however, 
individuals in the I-III group have lower weight and substantially lower height percentiles

these infants, trends do show improvement.

The goal established by the CF Foundation nutrition guidelines for children age 2 to 19 
years is a BMI at or above the 50th percentile.28 The median BMI percentile is above 
the 50th percentile for this age group. The median weight percentile is approaching the 
recommendation, but the median height percentile still has room for improvement. 
People with CF age 2 to 19 in the IV-V group have higher BMI percentiles than those in 
the I-III group, but there is substantial variation in the outcomes and significant overlap in 
outcomes between the two.

Successive birth cohorts show improved weight and height percentiles, most notably in the 
youngest cohorts. Multiple factors may be contributing to improvements in the youngest 
cohorts, including implementation of NBS with early intervention.

The BMI goal established by the CF Foundation nutrition guidelines is at or above 22 for 
females and 23 for males age 20 years and older.28 Among individuals in the mutation class 
I-III group, median BMI is below the goal, whereas individuals in the class IV-V group have a 
median BMI above the goal. Considerable variation in BMI exists within each genotype group, 
with significant overlap between individuals in the I-III group and the IV-V group. Of note, 
a substantial proportion of those in the IV-V group are overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9), and 
some are obese (BMI of 30+). 
 
Since the 1980s, significant progress in nutritional outcomes has been made for both 
pediatric and adult CF populations. Since 2008, the median BMI percentile of individuals 
with CF age 2 to 19 has met the CF Foundation goal of the 50th percentile. Aging of the 
CF population and a greater number of late diagnoses with genotypes associated with milder 
disease may also be contributing to this trend in adults.

Infant Feeding 
The majority of infants with CF receive formula feeding as the primary form of feeding or as 
a supplement to breast-feeding. Cow’s milk-based formula with the standard caloric density 
of 20 calories per ounce is the most common feeding used from birth to age 3 months. 
More calorie-dense formulas are used after 3 months of age. CF Foundation infant care 
guidelines recommend human breast milk or standard infant formula as the initial form of 
feeding. Fortified human breast milk, calorie-dense formulas or complementary foods are 
recommended if the infant is failing to gain weight adequately.6
Infants may be included in more than one age category. They may also be counted more than once within an age category if different forms 
of feeding were recorded during separate clinic visits while within the same age category.

PULMONARY FUNCTION
Pulmonary function is an important clinical indicator of the health of individuals with CF
. 
This section provides information on trends in pulmonary function by age, as well as 
variations in pulmonary function across CF care centers and by mutation class groups. 
Pulmonary function is measured using the FEV1 percent predicted and calculated using 
the GLI reference equations.2
Successive birth cohorts show improved pulmonary function, and cross-sectional 
analyses from 1994 to 2015 show improvement in the FEV1 percent predicted across all 
ages. The majority of those age 18 — a typical age of transition to adult care — now 
have normal lung function or mild obstruction, defined as an FEV1 percent predicted 
greater than or equal to 70. 
FEV1 percent predicted is steadily improving and currently is above 90 percent predicted into 
early adolescence.
The proportion of people with CF age 18 who are in the normal/mild category (FEV1 ≥70 
percent predicted) has increased from 39.9 percent in 1990 to 72.1 percent in 2015, while 
the proportion in the severe category (FEV1 <40 percent predicted) has decreased from 24.9 
percent to 5.3 percent.

It is important to point out that spirometry is not a sensitive measure of early lung disease 
in CF. With that caveat in mind, the vast majority of children have normal or “mild” 
impairment in pulmonary function. This proportion decreases with age until age 45, when 
the population has nearly equal proportions of individuals with mild, moderate and severe 
lung disease.

Variation in FEV1 Outcomes by Mutation Class
As the majority of individuals with CF are in the class I-III group of mutations (70.7 percent 
of those genotyped), the outcomes of this group drive national values.
In children and adults with CF, median lung function is lower among individuals in the I-III 
group than in individuals in the IV-V group (6.4 percent lower in children and 8.8 percent 
lower in adults). However, there is considerable variation among individuals within each 
mutation class group and substantial overlap between the two groups.

FEV1 AND BMI OUTCOMES
Pulmonary and nutritional outcomes are two key metrics of health among individuals 
with CF and are therefore the main focus of quality improvement work within the CF 
care center network. The data show that for both children and adults with CF
, pulmonary 
function and nutrition status are related and improvements in one metric are associated 
with improvements in the other. 
The pulmonary and nutritional goals are as follows: 
•  
For children, FEV1 percent predicted greater than or equal to 100 and BMI 
percentile meeting or exceeding the 50th percentile.
•  
For adults, FEV1 percent predicted greater than or equal to 75 and BMI greater 
than or equal to 22 for females and 23 for males.28

The figures below show the distribution of CF care centers with regard to their median 
nutritional and pulmonary outcomes and changes in distribution between 2005 and 2015. 
Each dot in the figure represents a value from an accredited CF care center or affiliate 
program. Ideally, CF care centers would be in the upper right quadrant of the graph, which 
represents centers that meet both pulmonary function and nutritional goals. In 2015, the 
majority of pediatric CF care centers met nutritional guidelines and showed improvements in 
median pulmonary function during the preceding 10 years. 
Among adult CF care centers, 33.1 percent are meeting pulmonary function goals for individuals. 
The data show progress toward more CF care centers meeting nutritional goals.

PULMONARY EXACERBATIONS
Pulmonary exacerbations, characterized by intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment in the 
hospital or at home, are associated with morbidity, mortality and decreased quality of 
life. They are also a major driver of health care costs. This section displays trends in the 
rate of pulmonary exacerbations over time and by age group, as well as variation in 
exacerbation rates and treatment characteristics by CF care center.
Despite notable improvements in pulmonary function and nutritional status over the 
years, there has been no reduction in the proportion of individuals with CF who are 
treated with IV antibiotics for pulmonary exacerbations. This suggests that clinicians’ 
threshold for prescribing IV antibiotics may have changed over time. 
Individuals with CF who are between ages 15 and 30 are more likely than those in other age 
groups to experience a pulmonary exacerbation during the year.

When the CF Foundation developed guidelines for the treatment of pulmonary 
exacerbations in 2009, little published literature or data were available upon which to 
base recommendations.39 Current practice within the CF Foundation care center network 
indicates a median treatment duration of about 2 weeks, with adults more likely to complete 
some of their treatment at home. Further research is underway to develop evidence for best 
practices in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations.

THERAPIES
Gastrointestinal (GI) Therapies
The CF Foundation infant care guidelines recommend that pancreatic enzyme 
replacement therapy (PERT) be started for all infants with two CFTR mutations 
associated with pancreatic insufficiency, a fecal elastase below 200μg/g of stool and/or 
signs of malabsorption.6 
For infants with CF under age 2, the guidelines recommend assessment of pancreatic 
functional status by measurement of fecal elastase.6 Data on fecal elastase test results have 
been collected in the Registry since 2010, with an increase in the number of individuals with 
a fecal elastase test. Almost 60 percent of infants were tested in 2015. Some 745 individuals 
under age 24 months did not have a fecal elastase value reported, 89% of which were on 
PERT in 2015. Almost all individuals with a fecal elastase value of less than 200 have been 
prescribed PERT. Approximately one-quarter of individuals with fecal elastase values greater 
than 200 were also prescribed PERT. 
A large proportion of individuals of all ages are prescribed PERT: the proportion remains 
over 80 percent until age 40, when the proportion in each age cohort begins to decrease. The 
decrease in the proportion of older CF individuals prescribed PERT is most likely due to 
survivor bias.

Infants with evidence of pancreatic insufficiency are recommended to receive 2,000 to 
5,000 lipase units per feeding (total lipase dose), with adjustments as the infant grows.6 The 
Registry data show that the mean highest dose of lipase among children younger than 2 years 
is 14,006 total lipase units per largest meal. 
For individuals age 2 years and older, the recommended upper limit for enzyme dosing is 
2,500 lipase units/kg/meal and a total of 10,000 lipase units/kg/day.28 The mean dose of 
lipase units/kg/meal for individuals 2 to 19 years is 1,856 and for individuals 20 years and 
older is 1,773.
Acid blockers are commonly prescribed for people with CF to treat gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD) and/or to decrease the acidity of the stomach to increase the effectiveness 
of PERT. Overall, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are prescribed more often (51.4 percent 
of individuals) than H2 blockers (16.6 percent of individuals). H2 blockers are used more 
frequently in younger individuals and their use tapers among older individuals. In contrast, 
use of PPIs is lowest among younger individuals and consistently about 50 percent among 
individuals age 20 and older. 
 
CF-specific vitamins also play an important role in the overall regimen of GI therapies for 
individuals with CF. In 2015, almost 92 percent of individuals age 2 to 19 and nearly 80 
percent of individuals age 20 and older were prescribed CF-specific vitamins.

Pulmonary Therapies
Chronic pulmonary therapies are a major component of the treatment regimen for 
individuals with CF
. This section provides data on the uptake of and trends in the 
prescription of pulmonary medications recommended for chronic use by the CF 
Foundation pulmonary guidelines committee. Data are also provided on medications 
that are not recommended and on those for which the committee did not find sufficient 
evidence to recommend for or against chronic use.40 
Typically between 60 to 80 percent of the eligible population uses CF therapies and the use 
of most therapies has increased over time. Over the last few years, additional formulations 
of inhaled tobramycin have become available, so the chart below includes all formulations. 
Chronic oral antibiotics are used infrequently (by 14.7 percent of the CF population). The 
availability of multiple pulmonary therapies for CF is beneficial; however, it also contributes to 
treatment complexity and overall burden on individuals with CF and their caregivers.

Pulmonary Medication Prescriptions by Age
There are three classes of inhaled antibiotics for treatment of P
. aeruginosa infections. 
Tobramycin is used most frequently, followed by aztreonam and colistin. For all medications, 
peak use occurs during adolescence and young adulthood.
Dornase alfa is prescribed for the majority of individuals with CF. More than half of them are 
prescribed hypertonic saline either in place of, or in addition to, dornase alfa. Azithromycin 
is also widely used, with peak use occurring at slightly older ages than for use of dornase alfa 
and hypertonic saline.
A substantial proportion of individuals with CF are prescribed inhaled corticosteroids and, to 
a lesser degree, leukotriene modifiers.

Bronchodilators are used extensively among individuals with CF. Almost all people with CF are 
prescribed beta agonists, except for a very small percentage who are prescribed anticholinergics. 
Multiple pulmonary therapies are available for individuals with CF. Inhaled medications are 
effective treatments for pulmonary disease, but they require time to prepare, administer and 
clean after treatment. All people with CF are eligible for dornase alfa and hypertonic saline 
prescriptions. Those with P
. aeruginosa infection are typically prescribed inhaled antibiotics. 
Almost all individuals are prescribed at least one inhaled medication, and over half of those 
age 10 and older are prescribed two or more of these therapies.    
Inhaled antibiotic use includes the use of tobramycin, aztreonam, colistin or other aminoglycosides.

Medications Recommended for Chronic Use
Recommended therapies are widely prescribed, with the exception of ibuprofen; however, 
there is considerable variation across the CF Foundation care center network. Increasingly, 
individuals with CF are using multiple inhaled antibiotics for the treatment of  
P
. aeruginosa infections. 
 
*Individuals were considered eligible if they met the selection criteria used in the U.S. azithromycin trial.3

Medications with Insufficient Evidence to Recommend For or Against Chronic Use
In 2013, the CF Foundation pulmonary guidelines committee determined that there was 
insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the chronic use of inhaled beta agonists, 
inhaled anticholinergics, leukotriene modifiers and inhaled colistin to improve lung function, 
reduce exacerbations or improve quality of life.40 Inhaled beta agonists are used consistently 
across the CF care center network for the vast majority of individuals with CF. Use of colistin 
has decreased in recent years. The other medications are used infrequently. 
Medications Not Recommended for Chronic Use
Inhaled steroids continue to be commonly prescribed, despite the recommendation against 
their chronic use in the absence of asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis 
(ABPA).

Medication Use in Young Children
Recently, the CF Foundation released the first set of guidelines focusing on the preschool 
timeframe from ages 2 to 5.19 Although the results of rigorous efficacy trials are not available 
for this age group, the guidelines recommend that dornase alfa and hypertonic saline be 
selectively offered to individuals on the basis of individual circumstances. The chart below 
shows the use of these medications among children younger than age 6. 
Most children under age 6 are prescribed inhaled bronchodilators. Dornase alfa is prescribed in 
43.5 percent of children younger than age 3 and in almost 70 percent of children ages 3 to 5.

Airway Clearance Techniques
The CF Foundation pulmonary guidelines recommend airway clearance for all individuals 
with CF.41 A high-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) vest is the most widely used 
airway clearance technique in persons with CF after infancy.
The CF Foundation pulmonary guidelines recommend aerobic exercise as an adjunct therapy 
for airway clearance and for its additional benefits to overall health.41 Many individuals with 
CF report exercising in addition to their primary method of airway clearance, with 32.6 
percent of children and 45.2 percent of adults identifying exercise as one of their methods of 
airway clearance.

In 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Ivacaftor for individuals with 
at least one G551D mutation ages 6 and older. Since then there have been label extensions 
for other mutations and for younger patients.  In 2015, Ivacaftor in combination with 
Lumacaftor was approved for individuals age 12 and older who are homozygous for the 
F508del mutation. 
 
Ivacaftor
In 2015, among 2,176 eligible individuals in the Registry, 1,526 (70 percent) were prescribed 
Ivacaftor. For all individuals currently eligible, the percentage prescribed Ivacaftor is highest 
(89 percent) among individuals age 6 and older with a G551D mutation, and is lowest  
(43 percent) among individuals with an R117H mutation. An additional 201 individuals 
were prescribed Ivacaftor during one or more clinic visits in 2015 who did not meet the label 
eligibility criteria. 
The percentage of individuals age 6 and older with a G551D mutation who were prescribed 
Ivacaftor increased from 77 to 89 percent from 2012 to 2015.

Ivacaftor Prescription by Eligibility Criteria
Among all Ivacaftor-eligible individuals, the median proportion of individuals receiving 
a prescription for the medication is 72 percent, with an interquartile range from 57 to 85 
percent. For those younger than 18 years, the median percentage of individuals who received 
an Ivacaftor prescription is 67 percent compared with 80 percent of individuals age 18 and 
older; more variation in prescription rates across centers is observed among those younger 
than 18 than among those age 18 and older.
Ivacaftor / Lumacaftor
In 2015, Ivacaftor/Lumacaftor was prescribed for 3,708 individuals, or 45 percent of the 
eligible population of individuals age 12 and older who are homozygous for the F508del 
mutation (47 percent of those age 12 to 17 and 40 percent of those age 18 and older). It is 
important to note that Ivacaftor/Lumacaftor combination therapy was not commercially 
available to individuals with CF until July 2015. There does not appear to be substantial 
variation in the proportion of eligible individuals receiving a prescription for Ivacaftor/
Lumacaftor across age groups.

COMPLICATIONS
Management of complications secondary to CF is important for maintaining an individual’s 
health and quality of life. Complications of CF can affect many different organ systems; they 
can be the direct result of the malfunction of the CFTR protein or a downstream effect of 
the disease or its treatment. 
Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) remains an important and highly prevalent 
complication that greatly affects a person’s quality of life and is associated with increased 
morbidity and mortality. Bone disease, sinus disease and depression are other complications 
of CF that are more common among older adults.

CF Complications by Age, 2015
Addressing complications of CF is an increasingly important component of treatment and 
care for people with CF. The prevalence of bone disease and GERD is higher among older 
age groups. Sinus disease, asthma and depression are higher among older children and 
adolescents, but stable among adults of all ages. The prevalence of CFRD peaks at about age 
45. ABPA, DIOS, and anxiety are less prevalent and appear to remain consistent across all 
age groups. Liver disease is more prevalent in children.

 Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry   Annual Data Report 2015
64 
Addressing the mental health of all individuals with CF is critical to maintaining their overall 
health and quality of life. Substantial proportions of individuals living with CF report anxiety 
and/or depression. The prevalence reported to date is likely an underestimate as mental 
health screenings have not been consistently performed across the CF care center network. 
With the publication of guidelines on depression and anxiety,42 we anticipate that more 
systematic screening will uncover a higher prevalence of these complications. Data regarding 
screening for depression and anxiety can be found in the earlier section of this report (page 
24) that discusses CF care guidelines. Prevalence is highest in early adulthood, a time 
when lung disease often worsens. Almost 10 percent of people with CF report having both 
depression and anxiety. 
The table on the opposite page displays complications by mutation class groups. Over time, 
the percentage of individuals reporting no complications has decreased. This observation is 
potentially the result of improved screening for complications, more consistent reporting of 
these complications in the Registry and improved  survival. CFRD, liver disease, meconium 
ileus and DIOS are more prevalent among individuals in mutation classes I-III. In contrast, 
pancreatitis is more common among individuals in mutation classes IV-V. It is interesting to 
note that the prevalence of anxiety and depression does not differ by mutation class.

Cystic Fibrosis-Related Diabetes (CFRD)
CFRD is associated with weight loss, lung function decline and increased mortality.43 Early 
diagnosis and treatment may minimize the impact of CFRD. The CF Foundation CFRD 
guidelines recommend screening all individuals annually, starting at age 10, with an oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT).43
CFRD screening using blood glucose tests is routinely performed at the vast majority of 
CF care centers. However, there is not as much use of the recommended OGTT test, and 
substantial variation across CF care centers.

It is encouraging to note that rates of screening adolescents for CFRD using the OGTT have 
increased since the publication of the CF Foundation CFRD guidelines in 2010.43
The prevalence of CFRD is higher among adults with CF than among children with CF. 
Impaired glucose tolerance is most prevalent in adolescence; these individuals are at increased 
risk for developing CFRD and may benefit from increased monitoring. 
The vast majority of individuals who were diagnosed with CF-related diabetes are noted in the 
Registry as being treated with insulin, as recommended in the CF Foundation guidelines.43

The CFRD guidelines recommend regular hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) measurements 
for individuals with CFRD.43 There is variation by CF care center in the percentage of 
individuals with CFRD with one or more HgbA1c measurement during the year, but a 
majority of centers are testing their patients at least annually.
The goal established by the CF Foundation CFRD guidelines is an HgbA1c less than 7.0 
percent for individuals with CFRD.43 More than half of individuals with CFRD are meeting 
this guideline.
Rates of secondary complications of CFRD, including retinopathy, microalbuminuria, 
kidney disease and neuropathy, remain low. As the CF population continues to age, 
adult CF care providers should continue to screen individuals for these complications, as 
recommended by the CFRD guidelines.43

TRANSPLANTATION
Lung transplantation remains an option for some individuals with severe lung disease. 
The annual number of lung transplant procedures for individuals with CF fluctuates 
yearly, with an overall upward trend. Bilateral lung transplant is by far the most common 
procedure.
There were 1,552 individuals in the Registry in 2015 who were reported to have received a 
lung, kidney, heart or liver transplant.
Lung Transplantation
There were 1,388 individuals in the Registry in 2015 who were reported to have ever had 
a lung transplant. This includes 212 individuals who were reported to have received a lung 
transplant in 2015.

SURVIVAL
Researchers from the United States and Canada recently published an article with 
recommendations for best practices in calculating median predicted survival.44 Beginning 
this year, the CF Foundation has adopted these recommendations. The figure below shows 
that estimates of median predicted survival using the recommended method (red) are higher 
than the method previously used (blue). The main reason is that the previous method looked 
only at an individual’s status during a specific year. If an individual was not seen at a CF 
care center during a year or their data was not entered in the Registry that year, they were 
excluded from the analysis. In contrast, the recommended method includes individuals who 
were not in the Registry during a specific year but subsequently returned to a CF care center; 
such individuals are included in the calculation during all intervening years since their last 
data was entered in the Registry, thereby providing a more accurate estimate of predicted 
survival among individuals with CF.

Survival Metrics
The following metrics are included in this year’s report:
1)  
Median Predicted Survival: All individuals currently in the Registry are included in this 
calculation. It reports the age at which 50 percent of the current population is expected to 
survive, given the current age distribution of the population and assuming that mortality 
rates do not change. This is a key survival metric that we have reported for many years. 
2)  
Mortality Rate: The number of deaths in the calendar year divided by the number of 
individuals in the Registry during that calendar year.
3)  
Life Expectancy: All individuals currently in the Registry are included in this calculation. 
This metric is an estimate of the average additional years of life for individuals at a 
specific age.45 Therefore there is no single measure of life expectancy for the entire CF 
population.
4)  
Median Age at Death: This calculation includes only individuals who died during the 
calendar year and therefore should not be used to predict survival in the entire CF 
population. This metric is the age at which exactly half of the deaths of individuals with 
CF were below that age and half were above that age.
All metrics that use current data to predict survival make the assumption that the mortality rate 
will not change over time. Therefore, they do not take into account any potential benefits 
from newly available CFTR modulators and other improvements in clinical care.
Median Predicted Survival
The median predicted survival age in 2015 is 41.6 years (95 percent confidence interval: 
38.5–44.0 years). This estimate increased from 40.0 in 2014. Annual estimates are imprecise 
because of the relatively low number of deaths in a given year, so we grouped the data into 
5-year increments. The graph below shows gains in median predicted survival from 1986 to 
2015 in 5 year increments. The median predicted survival age between 2011 to 2015 was 
41.1 years (95 percent confidence interval: 39.6–42.1 years).
Using the currently recommended method for calculation median predicted survival.

73 
Mortality Rate
The mortality rate in 2015 is 1.5 deaths per 100 individuals with CF in the Registry. Over 
time, there has been a decrease in the mortality rate. This is encouraging given that the 
median age of individuals in the Registry has increased from 11.6 years in 1986 to 18.6 years 
in 2015.
 
Life Expectancy
Life expectancy at specific ages is another metric to help understand changes in survival over 
time. However, this metric reflects population-based averages for all individuals of a given 
age and does not take into consideration the characteristics of individuals. Also, note that the 
older patient population likely reflects a survivor bias for those with milder genotypes (see 
page 19). 
The calculations indicate that infants born in 2015 have an estimated average life expectancy 
of 45.2 years. Life expectancy is similar for those with an attained age up to 20 years. 
Individuals who have attained 30 and 40 years of age have an estimated average life 
expectancy of 55.6 and 62.6 years, respectively. Because the number of individuals in the 
Registry with attained ages of 60 and older is small, they were not included in the figure.

Examining the data over time, life expectancy at birth was 34.0 years during 1991–1995, 
then increased to 39.2 years during 2001–2005, then rose to 45.2 years during 2011–2015. 
This is the age group with the largest observed increase in life expectancy (12.5 years). 
During the same time period, the life expectancy at birth for the entire US population 
increased by 4.0 years. Life expectancy for 20 year olds remained at about 40 years until 
1997–2001. It has risen steadily since then to 48.1 years. Smaller but consistent increases 
have also been observed among those who are age 40.

Median Age at Death
The median age at death for the 448 deaths of people with CF reported in 2015 is 29.1 
years. Overall, 5 percent of deaths occur in individuals younger than age 13. Half of the 
deaths occur between age 22 and 39. Over time, the increase in the median age at death 
has been more modest than that observed in the median predicted survival, but it has 
increased steadily from a median age of death of 22 years in 1995 to 25 years in 2005. As 
noted previously, the median age of death cannot be used to predict survival in the entire 
population. 
Causes of Death
Among the 448 deaths in 2015, the primary causes were respiratory/cardiorespiratory and 
transplant-related, similar to previous years. Over 50 percent of deaths among individuals 
in the Registry occurred among people with CF who were F508del homozygotes. Although 
less than 5 percent of individuals in the Registry population are living after organ transplant, 
transplant recipients represent 19 percent of all reported deaths.

Box-and-Whisker Charts to Show Center-Level and  
Population-Level Variation
Throughout the report, box-and-whisker plots are used in two ways: to show center-level and 
population-level variation. For example, the box-and-whisker plot below shows the median 
body mass index (BMI) percentile among individuals ages 2 to 19 years across all centers:
Center-level box and whisker plots are constructed by first determining the median value 
for individuals at each center, then creating the box-and-whisker plots using the summary 
numbers from each center. 
Box-and-whisker plots provide the following information as noted in the figure above:
A. Minimum: The lowest median BMI percentile at any center (left “whisker”).
B. 0-25th percentile: 25 percent of centers’ observations fall below.
C.  
Median: 50 percent of observations fall below and 50 percent fall above. Median 
values, shown by a red line, are preferable to mean values because they are not 
skewed by extreme values.
D. “Box”: 25th to 75th percentile values.
E. 75th – 100th percentile: 75 percent of centers’ observations fall below.
F. Maximum: The highest median BMI percentile of all centers (right “whisker”).
In addition, box-and-whisker plots are used to show the distribution of population-level 
variations for outcomes and process measures. An example is the figure below, which also 
displays the variation in BMI percentile among individuals ages 2 to 19 years in the 2015 
reporting year. In this case, each individual’s data is included in the box-and-whisker plot. 
As a result, the median value is nearly identical but there is much wider variation in the 
population-level plot as compared to the center-level.

Using Combined Data Charts to Display Selected Attributes, by Age 
Throughout this report, combined data charts are used to display selected attributes or health 
outcomes by age for people with CF; histograms are used for raw patient counts and line charts 
are used for percentage of total individuals by age. Within these charts, the figure on the left 
shows the total number of people with CF at each age, as well as the number with the attribute 
displayed. The figure on the right shows the percentage of people with CF at each age with 
the attribute. We removed those over 70 years for this display because there were less than 
10 individuals in any age group over 70 years. For consistency across the report and to allow 
comparisons across different attributes, the light gray bars in the background always represent 
the total number of people with CF, in that age cohort, in the 2015 Registry data. Bars of other 
colors are used to show the number of people with a selected attribute (e.g., a complication). 
In the figure below, the histogram on the left shows the number of people who reported 
Medicaid as a form of insurance in blue and the number of people who reported Medicare as 
a form of insurance in red. The line graph on the right shows the percentage of people who 
selected each insurance type with the percentage lines using the same color scheme as the bar 
chart. These charts provide insight into how attributes change across age groups in the 2015 
Registry data.

In most cases where this type of display is used, the categories are not mutually exclusive, so an 
individual can be counted in more than one of the categories. In cases where the attributes are 
mutually exclusive, such as mutation class or lung function cohorts, a stacked bar is shown. 
Caution must be used when interpreting the data in these charts because there have been 
changes over time in the diagnosis, treatment and survival of people with CF. Specifically, 
universal newborn screening for CF has been in place in the United States since 2010 and was 
implemented even earlier in many states. Therefore, the diagnostic and clinical characteristics 
of very young individuals included in the Registry in recent years are different than those of 
similarly aged individuals previously included in the Registry. Prior to newborn screening, 
most infants were diagnosed because of clinical symptoms. Now, asymptomatic and potentially 
healthier infants are being diagnosed with CF and included in the Registry earlier than they 
previously would have been. Within older ages, we see an effect referred to as survivor bias, 
which is particularly evident in cross-sectional data. Older individuals currently in the Registry 
have survived and are likely healthier, and are therefore not representative of other people with 
CF who were included in the same birth cohort for analysis done at younger ages. We must 
keep these and other potential biases in mind when interpreting the data.
These two specific biases can be seen in the chart below. Individuals with a genotype with 
two mutations within classes I to III are typically associated with a severe phenotype and are 
assigned to the mutation class I-III group. Individuals with one or more mutations within 
classes IV or V are typically associated with a milder phenotype and are assigned to the 
mutation class IV-V group. We see a modest increase in number and percentage of individuals 
with class IV and V mutations among those ages 5 years and younger, i.e., children born in the 
era of universal newborn screening for CF. At older ages, the greater proportion of individuals 
observed with a genotype consisting of one or more mutations from classes IV or V is the result 
of survivor bias.
