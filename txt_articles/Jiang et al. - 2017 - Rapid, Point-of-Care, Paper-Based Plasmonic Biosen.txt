mild symptoms, which are very similar 
to other mosquito-borne Flavivirus infec-
tions.[3] However, most current diagnostic 
techniques take days and a central labora-
tory to obtain results. These techniques 
are relatively expensive, require equip-
ment that is not amenable to remote, and 
resource-limited regions such as refrig-
eration and bench-top plate readers where 
disease surveillance and control are criti-
cally needed.[4] Thus, there is a need for 
rapid, inexpensive, and accurate testing 
for ZIKV in point-of-care (POC) and 
resource-limited settings not dependent 
on refrigeration for test integrity. Addi-
tionally, an inexpensive, rapid test allows 
retention of infected individuals to affect 
immediate treatment and for counseling 
of pregnant women and women of child-
bearing age.
ZIKV nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) is 
necessary for viral replication and involved 
in immune evasion, viral pathogenesis[3] and is a major anti-
genic marker for ZIKV infection detectable for 1–2 weeks.[5] An 
ensuing host IgM/IgG response to ZIKV-NS1 (which evolves 
within one week) can serve as the basis of diagnostic assays 
for ZIKV infection providing a detection window of several 
months. Despite having high structural similarity with other 
Flavivirus NS1 proteins, ZIKV-NS1 displays a loop-surface 
interface with divergent electrostatic potential, avoiding cross 
reactivity with Dengue virus and other Flavivirus NS1 proteins, 
which can be exploited to differentiate ZIKV from other Flavi-
virus infections.[6]
Plasmonic biosensors based on refractive index sensitivity of 
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) are highly prom-
ising for sensitive and cost-effective biodiagnostics.[7] LSPR of 
metal nanostructures is shown to be sensitive enough to dif-
ferentiate various inert gases (refractive index difference on the 
order of 3 × 10−4 refractive index units), probe the conforma-
tional changes of individual biomacromolecules, detect single 
biomolecule binding events, monitor the kinetics of catalytic 
activity of single nanoparticles, and even optically detect a 
single electron.[8]
We have previously introduced bioplasmonic paper device 
(BPD) as a novel platform for implementing LSPR-based bio-
sensors.[9] Compared with conventional rigid substrates such 
as silicon and glass, paper substrates offer numerous advan-
tages such as high surface area, excellent wicking properties, 
mechanical flexibility, low cost, easy disposability, small sample 
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an increasing global health challenge. There is an urgent 
need for rapid, low-cost, and accurate diagnostic tests that can be broadly 
distributed and applied in pandemic regions. Here, an innovative, adaptable, 
and rapidly deployable bioplasmonic paper-based device (BPD) is demon-
strated for the detection of ZIKV infection, via quantification of serum anti-
ZIKV-nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) IgG and IgM. BPD is based on ZIKV-NS1 
protein as a capture element and gold nanorods as plasmonic nanotrans-
ducers. The BPD displays excellent sensitivity and selectivity to both anti-
ZIKV-NS1 IgG and IgM in human serum. In addition, excellent stability of 
BPDs at room and even elevated temperature for one month is achieved by 
metal–organic framework (MOF)-based biopreservation. MOF-based preser-
vation obviates the need for device refrigeration during transport and storage, 
thus enabling their use in point-of-care and resource-limited settings for ZIKV 
surveillance. Furthermore, the versatile design (interchangeable recognition 
element) of BPDs more generally enables their ready adaptation to diagnose 
other emerging infectious diseases.
Virus Detection
1. Introduction
ZIKV virus (ZIKV), a mosquito-borne Flavivirus, has become 
a global public health challenge.[1] ZIKV can cause congenital 
Zika syndrome in newborns and Guillain–Barré syndrome 
in adults and has raised a grave concern.[2] Unfortunately, 
ZIKV-infected individuals are largely asymptomatic or have

volume requirement, facile processing (cutting, bending, 
and dipping), and compatibility with conventional printing 
approaches (enabling multiplexed detection and multimarker 
biochips). Simply involving conventional laboratory filter paper 
adsorbed with biofunctionalized nanostructures, BPD exhibit 
great potential for the use of label-free, POC bioassays with 
the combination of handheld, battery-operated spectrometers. 
More importantly, with interchangeable recognition elements, 
BPD can be swiftly adapted for molecular diagnosis of many 
other diseases.
Recently, we introduced a simple and highly effective tech-
nique based on a zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) 
layer for preserving the biorecognition capability of immobi-
lized antibodies at ambient and elevated temperatures for sev-
eral days.[10] This facile and low-cost biopreservation method 
will allow the on demand use of paper-based plasmonic sen-
sors in point-of-care and resource-limited settings without the 
need for “cold chain” refrigeration, especially in tropical areas, 
where ZIKV monitoring and containment are of paramount 
importance[11]
Here, we introduce a rapid, point-of-care, low-cost assay 
based on BPDs for ZIKV diagnosis that can be employed in 
resource-limited regions. ZIKV-NS1 protein was used as the 
recognition element for the capture and detection of anti-ZIKV-
NS1 IgG and IgM; recognized diagnostic biomarkers of ZIKV 
infection.[6] BPDs exhibited excellent spectral homogeneity, 
sensitivity, dynamic range, selectivity, and importantly, effec-
tive detection in validated ZIKV patients’ sera. Finally, cou-
pled with metal–organic framework (MOF)-based biopreserva-
tion method, ZIKV paper-based plasmonic sensors exhibited 
excellent recognition ability after storage at room and elevated 
temperature for one month, indicating great potential for appli-
cation in resource-limited regions without the need of cold 
chain transport/storage.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Preparation of ZIKV-Based BPDs
The detection of antibodies against ZIKV-NS1 protein can 
be used as an accurate diagnostic approach due to the highly 
specific immune-response ensued by ZIKV-NS1 protein.[6e] 
We employed full length recombinant ZIKV-NS1 protein 
(Mw = 43 kDa, MyBiosource, San Diego, CA) as the recognition 
element and a monoclonal anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG (My Biosource) 
as the target bioanalyte to demonstrate the BPD. Because of 
their large refractive index sensitivity and excellent tunability 
of the LSPR wavelength,[12] gold nanorods (AuNRs) were 
employed as plasmonic nanotransducers (Figure 1).
We synthesized AuNRs using a seed-mediated method 
with a length of 63.1 ± 2.6 nm and a diameter of 25.0 ± 1.8 nm 
(Figure 2A and Figure S1, Supporting Information). To con-
jugate the AuNRs with ZIKV-NS1, we used carbodiimide 
crosslinker chemistry and thiol-terminated bifunctional 
polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG) as described earlier (see the 
Experimental Section for details).[9a,b,13] The SH-PEG-ZIKV-
NS1 conjugate covalently bound to the AuNRs surface via an 
Au–S linkage.[14] The flexible PEG chain increases the acces-
sibility of ZIKV NS1 to target anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG and also 
forms a protein-resist layer to reduce nonspecific binding of 
serum proteins, thus minimizing the assay background. The 
successful coupling of SH-PEG-ZIKV-NS1 to AuNR in solu-
tion resulted in a redshift of ≈2 nm in the longitudinal LSPR 
wavelength (Figure 2B). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was 
employed to monitor changes in the hydrodynamic size of 
the AuNR after bioconjugation with ZIKV-NS1 (Figure 2C). 
The increase in hydrodynamic size of about 3 nm indi-
cated the successful appendage of ZIKV-NS1 protein to the 
AuNRs.

Preparation of BPD was achieved by the immersion of a 
1 × 1 cm2 strip of laboratory filter paper (Whatman #1) in the 
ZIKV-NS1 functionalized AuNR solution. The scanning elec-
tron microscope (SEM) images of the paper revealed a uni-
form distribution of the AuNR-ZIKV-NS1 conjugates with no 
signs of aggregation or patchiness (Figure 2D). Longitudinal 
LSPR wavelength of AuNR-ZIKV-NS1 conjugates adsorbed on 
paper substrate exhibited a significant blueshift (≈34 nm) com-
pared to that in solution due to the change in the refractive 
index of the surrounding medium (aqueous to air + substrate) 
(Figure 2E). Extinction spectra collected at ten different sites 
across the 0.5 × 0.5 cm2 area of a BPD revealed excellent optical 
uniformity of the paper-based plasmonic sensor exhibited a 
small standard deviation of ≈1 nm (Figure 2F). The excellent 
spectral homogeneity is due to the highly uniform adsorp-
tion of AuNR-ZIKV-NS1 conjugates as evidenced by the SEM 
images (Figure 2D). The spectral homogeneity observed here is 
quite remarkable considering the simplicity of the fabrication 
process and the inherent heterogeneity of the paper substrates 
(large surface roughness and hierarchical nature of the fibrous 
mat) compared to the size of the AuNRs themselves.
2.2. Biosensor Performance
To probe the biosensing capability of the BPDs, we exposed 
them to phosphat buffered saline (PBS) buffer (pH 7.4) spiked 
with the monoclonal antibody, anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG. Extinction 
spectra were obtained from BPDs adsorbed with AuNR-ZIKV-
NS1 conjugates and subsequently exposed to anti-ZIKV-NS1 
IgG (Figure 3A). The LSPR wavelength of BPD exposed to anti-
ZIKV-NS1 (100 µg mL−1) on paper exhibited a ≈11 nm redshift 
compared to pristine AuNRs-ZIKV-NS1 conjugates. To probe 
the limit of detection, BPDs were exposed to varying concentra-
tions of monoclonal anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG. A monotonic increase 
of LSPR shift with increase in the concentration of monoclonal 
anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG can be observed (Figure 3B). The limit of 
detection of the BPD, which is determined by three times the 
standard deviation of the LSPR shift observed after exposure to 
pristine PBS (unspiked), was found to be 1 ng mL−1.
To investigate the biosensing performance of BPDs in 
complex physiological environment with various interfer-
ence species, we exposed ZIKV-NS1 functionalized BPDs to 
anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG in ZIKV-negative human serum diluted 
1–10 in PBS. To further reduce possible nonspecific binding in 
a complex biofluid such as sera, the BPDs were exposed to SH-
PEG-CH3 (2 mg mL−1 in PBS buffer pH 7.4) and 10% human 
serum albumin (HSA) to block the nonspecific binding sites 
on the AuNRs on paper substrates (see method for details). 
LSPR wavelength exhibited a ≈10 nm redshift after the expo-
sure of SH-PEG-CH3/HSA blocking agents and a further 
redshift of ≈ 9.5 nm upon exposure of anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG in 
diluted (10X in PBS) human serum (Figure 3C). The LSPR

shift exhibited a monotonic increase with the increase in the 
concentration of anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG in serum (Figure 3D). 
Note that there is a ≈1.9 nm shift due to nonspecific binding 
of blood proteins. Thus, the limit of detection of BPDs in 
serum (200 ng mL−1) is higher compared to that in PBS buffer 
(1 ng mL−1).
These results demonstrate that BPDs can provide a means 
for sensitive detection anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG in complex physi-
ological environments. To further investigate the perfor-
mance of ZIKV-NS1-based BPDs in clinical applications, we 
performed bioplasmonic assay on serum from ZIKV patients 
and ZIKV-negative healthy individuals. BPDs were exposed 
to serum of four patients with verified ZIKV infection pur-
chased from Antibody Systems Incorporated (Hurst, Texas). 
The serum of five healthy ZIKV-negative individuals served 
as control. The LSPR wavelength of healthy controls only 
showed ≈2 nm redshift possibly due to nonspecific binding 
of the serum proteins. In the case of ZIKV patient serum 
samples, we measured a significantly higher LSPR redshift 
≈7.3–8.5 nm compared to the healthy controls (Figure 3E,F

and Figure S2, Supporting Information) (p < 0.001, one-way 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)). Since the concentration curve 
is semilog, the 2 nm redshift of the control individuals corre-
sponds to ng mL−1 equivalents of immunoglobulins while the 
7.3–8.5 nm shift of the ZIKV-positive patients is in the range 
of 100–400 µg mL−1 immunoglobulins. That the AuNRs con-
jugated with ZIKV-NS1 protein captured IgG and IgM from 
infected patients is shown in Figure 4. The diagnostic paper 
substrates were extensively washed in PBS after the LSPR 
shift was determined, eluted with sodium dodecyl sulphate 
(SDS) sample buffer and the eluate analyzed by Western blot. 
Clearly, the eluates of three ZIKV-positive patients were highly 
positive for human IgG as indicated by prominent bands at 25 
and 55 kDa representing the light and heavy chains of human 
IgG, respectively, of positive patients 1–3. Positive patient 4 had 
barely detectable IgG. However, the eluate of patient 4 had a 
mix of human IgG and human IgM (a prom-
inent band at about 70 kDa representing the 
heavy chain of human IgM). These find-
ings are consistent with the well annotated 
information of patient symptoms (all four 
had joint pain but only three had fever) and 
results of commercial assays provided by 
Antibody Systems, Inc. (Hurst, TX) as shown 
in Table S1 in the Supporting Information. It 
should be kept in mind that our assay meas-
ures the sum of IgG and IgM that bind to the 
NS1 protein. The eluates of two ZIKV-nega-
tive control individuals were undetectable for 
either immunoglobulin. These results indi-
cate that BPDs can be used for the detection 
of anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG and IgM in human 
serum to differentiate ZIKV-positive from 
ZIKV-negative individuals.
2.3. Preserving the Biorecognition of the 
BPDs in the Absence of Refrigeration
The mosquito-borne Flavivirus, ZIKV cur-
rently flourishes in mostly resource limited 
warm and humid regions South and Central America.[11] How-
ever, there is concern of ZIKV outbreaks in warm and humid 
regions of Asia and Africa; equally resource-limited especially 
with respect to refrigeration. Thus, it is very important for the 
development and employment of robust bioassays which can 
remain stable in room and elevated temperature since cold 
chain transport/storage is greatly lacking. Recently, our group 
has demonstrated a highly efficient and low-cost method to 
preserve the activity of antibodies conjugated to plasmonic 
nanostructures using ZIF-8 as a protective layer.[10] We have 
employed this novel method to improve the stability of ZIKV-
NS1-based BPDs. The LSPR wavelength of BPD can be used 
to monitor the formation and removal of the ZIF-8 layer 
(Figure 5A,B). The LSPR wavelength exhibited a ≈28 nm red-
shift after the deposition of ZIF-8 layer (step 2 in Figure 5B 
and Figure S3A, Supporting Information). After storage of

ANOVA). MOF affords slight but significant protection at room temperature over 60 °C at 4 weeks (p = 0.039, one-way ANOVA with Tukey contrast).

ZIF-8-coated BPD, the protective layer can be quickly removed 
by washing with distilled water at pH 6 (Figure S3B, Sup-
porting Information). The complete removal of the ZIF-8 layer, 
which is important to restore the biorecognition capability of 
BPDs before exposure to target analytes, is evident by a ≈28 nm 
blueshift in the LSPR wavelength (step 3 in Figure 5B). Sub-
sequently, the LSPR wavelength of restored BPD exhibited a 
redshift of ≈11 nm upon specific binding of the monoclonal 
anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG (200 µg mL−1) to ZIKV-NS1.
To probe the long-term stability of ZIF-8-coated BPDs, we 
performed a time-lapse experiment to monitor the biorecog-
nition capability of the BPD stored at room temperature and 
60 °C for four weeks (Figure 5C and method for details). The 
ZIKV-NS1-based BPDs with ZIF-8 protective layer retained 
nearly 89% and 78% of recognition capability after storage at 
both lab room temperature (herein 20–23 °C) and 60 °C for 
four weeks. Significantly, bare BPDs without the protective 
layer quickly lost most of the biorecognition ability at both 
temperatures compared to the BPDs with the protective MOF 
layer (p < 0.001, one-way ANOVA with Tukey contrast). After 
four weeks, the room temperature stored had slightly but sig-
nificantly better activity than those stored at 60 °C (p = 0.039, 
one-way ANOVA with Tukey contrast). These results clearly 
demonstrate that the ZIF-8 biorecognition preservation 
method can enable a field-ready BPD, especially in warm, 
humid regions with epidemic spreading of ZIKV and limited 
resources.
3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have developed a rapid, low-cost paper-based 
plasmonic assay for ZIKV diagnosis. The IgG/IgM response 
for ZIKV NS1 protein after ZIKV infection is highly specific 
and has a long-term detection window of several months in 
infected individuals. The ZIKV-NS1-based BPD displayed 
excellent sensitivity, specificity, effective detection in validated 
ZIKV patients' sera, low-cost, and ease of preparation, storage, 
transport, and disposability. Suitable functionalization of 
AuNRs with a protein that elicits an immune response (herein 
ZIKV-NS1) can be used to monitor and quantify the IgM, IgG, 
and, if present, IgA associated with that immune response.[6e] 
Combined with the MOF-based biopreservation method, ZIKV-
NS1-based BPD holds great potential for providing robust 
diagnostic solution to current ZIKV outbreak. Furthermore, 
our versatile BPD platform design can be applied to a broad 
range of public health threats, allowing for rapid development 
of low-cost, robust point-of-care diagnostics in resource-limited 
regions.
4. Experimental Section
Synthesis of Gold Nanorods (AuNRs): Gold nanorods were synthesized 
using a seed-mediated approach.[15] Seed solution was prepared by 
adding 0.6 mL of an ice-cold 10 × 10−3 m sodium borohydride solution 
into 10 mL of 0.1 m cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and 
2.5 × 10−4 m chloroauric acid (HAuCl4) solution under vigorous stirring 
at 25 °C. The color of the seed solution changed from yellow to brown. 
Growth solution was prepared by mixing 95 mL of CTAB (0.1 m), 0.5 mL 
of silver nitrate (10 × 10−3 m), 4.5 mL of HAuCl4 (10 × 10−3 m), and 
0.55 mL ascorbic acid (0.1 m) consecutively. The solution was mixed 
by gentle stirring. To the resulting colorless solution, 0.12 mL of freshly 
prepared seed solution was added and set aside in the dark overnight. 
Prior to use, the AuNRs solution was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 
10 min to remove excess CTAB and redispersed in nanopure water 
(18.2 MΩ cm).
AuNRs-ZIKV-NS1 Conjugation: A solution was prepared by adding 
heterobifunctional polyethylene glycol (SH-PEG-COOH) in water 
(2 × 10−6 m, Mw = 5000 g mol−1, Jenkem Technology) with the same 
molar ratio of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (Thermo 
Scientific), and N-hydroxy succinimide (Thermo Scientific), followed by 
shaking for 1 h. The pH of the above reaction was adjusted to 7.4 by 
adding 10 × concentrated PBS, followed by the addition of 200 µL of 
recombinant ZIKV-NS1 protein (9.1 × 10−6 m, Mw = 43 kDa). The reaction 
mixture was incubated for an additional 2 h and concentrated/filtered 
to remove excess chemicals and byproducts by centrifugation using a 
microcentrifuge tube with a 30 kDa filter (Amicon Ultra-0.5 concentrator). 
The conjugate mixture was then washed and reconcentrated in the filter 
with water twice. The AuNR-ZIKV-NS1 was prepared by adding 30 µL 
SH-PEG-ZIKV-NS1 conjugate solution (18.2 × 10−6 m) to 1 mL twice 
centrifuged AuNRs solution with incubation for 1 h.
AuNRs-ZIKV-NS1 Paper Preparation and Tests in Buffer: A regular 
laboratory filter paper (Whatman #1) was used for the absorption 
of AuNRs- ZIKV-NS1 conjugates. Typically, a 1 × 1 cm2 paper strip is 
immersed in a solution of AuNR- ZIKV NS1 conjugates overnight at 
4 °C. The paper strip was taken out and extensively washed with water 
to remove unbound AuNR-ZIKV-NS1 and any SH-PEG-ZIKV-NS1. The 
papers can be cut to appropriate size (0.5 × 0.5 or 0.3 × 0.3 cm2) and 
immersed in different concentrations of anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG in PBS buffer 
(pH 7.4) for 1 h at 4 °C. It was removed and washed thoroughly with 
PBS buffer (7.4) and dried under a stream of nitrogen.
Spiked Human Serum Test: In the case of testing the spiked human 
serum, ZIKV-NS1-based BPDs were exposed to 2 × 10−6 m SH-PEG-CH3 
and then 10% human serum albumin solution to saturate any 
nonspecific binding sites on the AuNRs and paper substrate. The sensor 
was then washed using PBS buffer (pH 7.4) prior to use. For establishing 
dose-response curves, anti- ZIKV-NS1 IgG of various concentrations 
was used to spike human serum (1–10 dilution) in PBS buffer (pH 7.4). 
The BPDs were immersed in these solutions and left at 4 °C for 1 h, 
washed thoroughly with PBS buffer, and dried for extinction spectra 
measurements.
Clinical Test: For testing the capability for clinical samples, the 
developed BPDs (after nonspecific binding prevention processes 
mentioned above) were exposed to sera (1–10 dilution) of four ZIKV-
positive patients (purchased from Antibody Systems, Inc., Hurst, TX) 
and five healthy control individuals from the metropolitan St. Louis area 
(Approval was obtained from the Washington University Institutional 
Review Board and written informed consent was obtained from all 
patients) for 1 h and washed thoroughly with PBS buffer, dried for 
extinction spectra measurements.
ZIF-8 Biorecognition Preservation: To form ZIF-8 films on AuNRs- 
ZIKV-NS1 paper, 1 mL of 2-methylimidazole solution (160 × 10−3 m, in 
nanopure water) was mixed with 1 mL of zinc acetate dihydrate solution 
(40 × 10−3 m, in nanopure water), and agitated for 10 s. The paper was 
incubated in a freshly made ZIF-8 precursor solution described above 
for 3 h to facilitate growth of the MOF layer. Subsequently, the paper 
with and without MOF layer were stored in both room temperature 
(nominal lab temperature 20–23 °C) and 60 °C for various time and the 
ability to detect anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG was tested after rinsing the ZIF-8 
layer with nanopure water at pH 6 for 5 min. The percentage of retained 
recognition capability was used to quantitatively evaluate the antibody 
preservation efficacy of the MOF under various storage conditions. 
The retained recognition capability was calculated as the percentage of 
the redshift upon specific binding of anti-ZIKV-NS1 (100 µg mL−1) to a 
restored biochip after several days of storage at elevated temperatures 
compared with the redshift obtained from the same batch of freshly 
made substrate (which was considered as the reference sample tested

instantly without an MOF coating). For example, the redshift of 10 nm 
compared with the redshift of 11 nm in the case of the reference sample 
in the same batch corresponds to a retained recognition capability 
 
of 91%.
Characterization Techniques: Transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM) images were recorded on a JEM-2100F (JEOL) field emission 
instrument. Samples were prepared by drying a drop of the solution 
on a carbon-coated grid, which had been previously made hydrophilic 
by glow discharge. SEM images were obtained using an FEI Nova 2300 
Field Emission SEM at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. The paper was 
gold sputtered for 60 s before SEM imaging. DLS measurements were 
performed using Malvern Zetasizer (Nano ZS). Raman spectra were 
obtained using a Renisha inVia confocal Raman spectrometer mounted 
on a Leica microscope with 20 x objective and 785 nm wavelength diode 
laser as an illumination source.
Extinction Spectra Measurements: Extinction spectra from paper 
substrates were collected using a CRAIC micro-spectrophotometer 
(QDI 302) coupled to a Leica optical microscope (DM 4000M) with 
20 × objective in the range of 450–800 nm with ten accumulations 
and 100 ms exposure time in reflection mode. The spectral resolution 
of the micro-spectrophotometer was 0.2 nm. Multiple UV–vis spectra 
(≈10) were collected from different locations of the paper strip before 
and after exposure to anti-ZIKV-NS1 IgG solutions. Shimadzu UV-1800 
spectrophotometer was employed to collect UV–vis extinction spectra 
from solution.
Immunoblot: BPD after measurement of the LSPR of patient sera 
were washed with PBS and eluted with SDS sample buffer. Proteins 
in the eluate were separated by means of 4–12% acrylamide gels 
(Invitrogen, CA) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by means 
of an iBLOT (Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked with a commercial 
blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) and incubated with 
1/500 dilution of mouse antihuman IgM u-chain specific antibody 
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in LI-COR blocking buffer containing 
0.05% Tween 20 overnight. After washing in PBS buffer containing 0.05% 
Tween 20, the membrane was incubated in 1/5000 dilutions each of IRDye 
680LT goat antihuman IgG (H + L) and IRDye 800CW goat antihuman 
IgM u-chain specific antibody diluted in LI-COR block containing 0.05% 
Tween 20 for 1 h. After extensive washing with PBS buffer containing 
0.05% Tween 20, the human IgG and IgM were visualized on an Odyssey 
Fc Imaging System (LI-COR Biosystems, Lincoln, NE).
Statistical Analysis: Statistical analysis was performed using Analyse-it 
for Excel 2010 (Analyse-it Software, Ltd, Leeds United Kingdom). A “P” 
value of 0.05 or less was considered significant.
