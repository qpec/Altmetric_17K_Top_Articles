Surgical site infection after gastrointestinal surgery in 
high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries: 
a prospective, international, multicentre cohort study
GlobalSurg Collaborative*
Summary
Background Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common infections associated with health care, but its 
importance as a global health priority is not fully understood. We quantified the burden of SSI after gastrointestinal 
surgery in countries in all parts of the world.
Methods This international, prospective, multicentre cohort study included consecutive patients undergoing elective 
or emergency gastrointestinal resection within 2-week time periods at any health-care facility in any country. Countries 
with participating centres were stratified into high-income, middle-income, and low-income groups according to the 
UN’s Human Development Index (HDI). Data variables from the GlobalSurg 1 study and other studies that have been 
found to affect the likelihood of SSI were entered into risk adjustment models. The primary outcome measure was 
the 30-day SSI incidence (defined by US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for superficial and deep 
incisional SSI). Relationships with explanatory variables were examined using Bayesian multilevel logistic regression 
models. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02662231.
Findings Between Jan 4, 2016, and July 31, 2016, 13 265 records were submitted for analysis. 12 539 patients from 
343 hospitals in 66 countries were included. 7339 (58·5%) patient were from high-HDI countries (193 hospitals 
in 30 countries), 3918 (31·2%) patients were from middle-HDI countries (82 hospitals in 18 countries), 
and 1282 (10·2%) patients were from low-HDI countries (68 hospitals in 18 countries). In total, 1538 (12·3%) patients 
had SSI within 30 days of surgery. The incidence of SSI varied between countries with high (691 [9·4%] of 
7339 patients), middle (549 [14·0%] of 3918 patients), and low (298 [23·2%] of 1282) HDI (p<0·001). The highest SSI 
incidence in each HDI group was after dirty surgery (102 [17·8%] of 574 patients in high-HDI countries; 74 [31·4%] of 
236 patients in middle-HDI countries; 72 [39·8%] of 181 patients in low-HDI countries). Following risk factor 
adjustment, patients in low-HDI countries were at greatest risk of SSI (adjusted odds ratio 1·60, 95% credible interval 
1·05–2·37; p=0·030). 132 (21·6%) of 610 patients with an SSI and a microbiology culture result had an infection that 
was resistant to the prophylactic antibiotic used. Resistant infections were detected in 49 (16·6%) of 295 patients in 
high-HDI countries, in 37 (19·8%) of 187 patients in middle-HDI countries, and in 46 (35·9%) of 128 patients in 
low-HDI countries (p<0·001).
Interpretation Countries with a low HDI carry a disproportionately greater burden of SSI than countries with a 
middle or high HDI and might have higher rates of antibiotic resistance. In view of WHO recommendations on SSI 
prevention that highlight the absence of high-quality interventional research, urgent, pragmatic, randomised trials 
based in LMICs are needed to assess measures aiming to reduce this preventable complication.

Introduction
Surgical site infection (SSI) is a large health burden for 
patients and health-care providers. It is the most common 
postoperative complication and causes pain and suffering 
to patients.1,2 SSI is universally expensive3 and could result 
in catastrophic health expenditure and impoverishment 
to patients who are required to pay for their own 
treatment.4 In low-income and middle-income countries 
(LMICs), single-centre retrospective series have suggested 
that SSI could be the most common infection associated 
with health care.1 However, prospective, standardised, 
and internationally comparable data on the incidence of 
SSI and adverse events associated with SSI are lacking.5–8
These knowledge gaps make allocation of resources 
to tackle SSI in LMICs challenging. The WHO 
Guideline Development Group recently published 
29 preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative 
recommendations about SSI prevention.6,9,10 These 
recommendations are welcomed but are necessarily 
based in large part on data extrapolated from high-
income countries and, consequently, might lack validity 
in resource-limited settings. Strategic planning to tackle

SSI has been hindered by a lack of high-quality global 
data. Microbiological data describing antimicrobial 
resistance in SSI and information on the likely origin 
of causative organisms are also needed to help 
refine prevention strategies and quality-improvement 
interventions.6,10
The GlobalSurg Collaborative designed and conducted 
an international, multicentre, prospective cohort study 
aimed at closing knowledge gaps in the incidence of SSI 
in global health settings. The primary aim was to 
determine variability in SSI rates in high-income, 
middle-income, and low-income settings.
Methods
Study design and participants
This international, multicentre, prospective cohort study 
used a published protocol11 and was done by teams of 
local investigators who were coordinated by a national 
lead investigator. Investigators were recruited via the 
GlobalSurg network, social media, and personal contacts. 
Any health-care facility in any country treating patients 
who fulfilled the inclusion criteria could participate. The 
collaborative network methodology has been described 
in detail elsewhere.12 Ethical and institutional approval 
was sought and obtained by each contributing institution 
as per local regulations. A UK National Health Service 
Research Ethics review considered this study exempt 
from formal research registration (South East Scotland 
Research 
Ethics 
Service, 
reference 
NR/1510AB5). 
Individual centres obtained their own audit or 
institutional approval, and ethical approval was obtained 
in countries where local research ethics committees 
deemed it a requirement. This study is reported 
according to the STROBE and SAMPL guidelines.
Investigators included patients from at least one 
2-week period that was chosen a priori by the local team. 
Consecutive sampling of patients undergoing elective or 
emergency gastrointestinal resection was done during 
the chosen 2-week period or periods. Consecutive 
sampling is a common non-probability sampling strategy 
in which all patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria 
within a defined time period are enrolled. A 2-week 
period was chosen to balance sample size requirements 
and pragmatism for the working clinicians who were 
enrolling patients and contributing data. The inclusion 
criteria were based on two considerations. First, the 
procedures were required to be relevant to the general 
surgeons who form the collaborative. Second, a 
reasonable baseline incidence of SSI was required so 
meaningful comparisons could be made with the 
predicted cohort size. So-called clean general surgery 
cases, such as simple hernia repair, were excluded on 
this basis. There was an absolute requirement for all 
cases in the chosen period to be included, but no 
minimum number was set to avoid bias against smaller 
centres. Gastrointestinal resection was defined as 
complete transection and removal of a segment of the 
oesophagus, stomach, small bowel, colon, rectum, 
appendix, or gallbladder and included formation or 
reversal of a gastrointestinal stoma. Emergency 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched for evidence of multinational research assessing 
surgical site infection (SSI) after abdominal surgery, focusing on 
low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We searched 
PubMed, MEDLINE, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov for 
articles published between Jan 1, 1997, and June 1, 2017, with the 
terms “wound infection” OR “surgical site infection” AND 
“developing countries” OR “low income” OR “middle income” 
OR “low and middle income”, without language restrictions. 
We reviewed related articles, references, and citations of eligible 
texts. Several low-volume, single-centre studies to characterise 
SSI in LMICs have been done in the past 20 years, but the 
research quality is low to medium. These studies were 
systematically reviewed in 2011 and included 57 studies of 
abdominal surgery, with reported SSI incidence ranging 
from 0·4% to 30·9% (between 1·5% and 81·0% for 
clean–contaminated surgery, 0·5% to 65·5% for contaminated 
surgery, and 0·2% to 100% for dirty surgery). The methodological 
quality of individual studies was low and heterogeneity was high, 
preventing meta-analysis. One multinational study has been 
done since 2010, and included patients from seven high-income, 
17 upper-middle-income, and six lower-middle-income 
countries. The low observed SSI incidence (4·1%) after abdominal 
surgery could relate to the passive 30-day follow-up strategy; 
additional limitations include a lack of data from lowest-income 
countries and exclusion of children.
Added value of this study
We identified the burden and clinical impact of SSI in patients 
undergoing gastrointestinal surgery in multiple income 
settings. We used standardised, validated, prospective 
methodology to provide global, contemporaneous data. SSI is 
most common after dirty surgery in LMICs. Even after casemix 
adjustment, patients in LMICs have a disproportionate burden 
of infection. A large proportion of SSIs are caused by 
organisms resistant to prophylactic antibiotics with the 
greatest apparent burden in LMICs.
Implications of all the available evidence
The burden of SSI is disproportionately greater on patients and 
health services in LMICs. Recent WHO recommendations on
preoperative and intraoperative measures for SSI prevention 
highlight an absence of high-quality evidence. Urgent, 
pragmatic, randomised trials based in LMICs are needed to 
assess measures aiming to reduce this preventable 
complication and associated antibiotic use.

procedures were defined as unplanned, non-elective 
operations and included procedures for trauma and 
reoperation after previous surgery. Open or minimally 
invasive procedures (eg, laparoscopic or robotic) 
were eligible. No age restrictions were included. Patients 
were excluded if the primary indication for surgery 
was vascular, gynaecological, obstetric, urological, or 
transplantation because the gastrointestinal tract is not 
typically opened.
Data variables from the GlobalSurg 1 study13 and other 
studies that have been found to affect the likelihood of 
SSI were entered into risk adjustment models. Patient 
variables included age, sex, physical status according to 
the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification 
system, existence of immune suppression (eg, HIV 
status, active malarial infection, diabetes, use of steroid 
therapies, chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive 
drugs), and smoking status. Disease-related variables 
included diagnostic category, timing of surgery (elective 
vs emergency), use of the WHO surgical safety checklist,14 
use of laparoscopy, use of epidural anaesthesia, 
use of prophylactic antibiotics, and intraoperative 
contamination. Contamination level2,15 was defined by the 
operating surgeon as clean (an incision in which no 
inflammation is encountered in a surgical procedure, 
without a break in sterile technique, and during which 
the respiratory, alimentary, and genitourinary tracts are 
not entered; inclusion criteria for this study excluded this 
group), clean–contaminated (an incision through which 
the respiratory, alimentary, or genitourinary tract is 
entered under controlled conditions but with no 
contamination encountered), contaminated (an incision 
undertaken during an operation in which there is a 
major break in sterile technique or gross spillage from 
the gastrointestinal tract, or an incision in which acute, 
non-purulent inflammation is encountered; open 
traumatic wounds more than 12–24 h old also fall into 
this category), or dirty (an incision undertaken during an 
operation in which the viscera are perforated or when 
acute inflammation with pus is encountered during the 
operation [eg, emergency surgery for faecal peritonitis], 
and for traumatic wounds where treatment is delayed, 
and faecal contamination or devitalised tissue is present).
Data were collected on the incidence and length of 
antimicrobial treatment before and after surgery. 
A pragmatic view was taken in the use of local 
protocols and techniques for collecting and processing 
microbiological specimens. Antimicrobial resistance was 
defined as resistance in the species presumed to be 
pathological to the antimicrobial used for prophylaxis. To 
aid in the communication of findings, organisms were 
broadly categorised as bowel-derived if cultures contained 
only Gram-negative bacilli, Enterococcus species, or 
anaerobic organisms, as skin-derived if cultures only 
contained skin-derived organisms such as Staphylococcus 
species, and as of mixed origin if cultures contained both 
bowel-derived and skin-derived cultures.
Data variables were selected to be objective, 
standardised, easily transcribed, and internationally 
relevant to maximise record completion and accuracy. 
Local investigators uploaded records to a secure online 
website, provided using the Research Electronic Data 
Capture (REDCap) system.16 The lead investigator at each 
site checked the accuracy of all cases before data 
submission. The submitted data were then checked 
centrally and when missing data were identified, the 
local lead investigator was contacted and asked to 
complete the record. Once vetted, the record was accepted 
into the dataset for analysis. Records that were vetted but 
remained incomplete were included in the patient 
flowchart but excluded from analysis.
Data validation was done in three parts across a 
representative sample of centres according to a pre-
specified protocol (appendix). First, centres self-reported 
the key processes used to identify and follow up patients. 
Second, independent validators (ie, doctors, nurses, or 
medical students who were not part of the recruiting 
teams) quantitatively reported case ascertainment and 
sampled data accuracy. Third, teams were interviewed to 
qualitatively assess collaborator engagement and data 
collection processes.
Outcomes
The primary outcome measure was the 30-day SSI 
incidence, defined using the US Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention criteria for superficial and deep 
incisional SSI.2 These criteria require the patient to have 
at least one of the following: (1) purulent drainage from 
the superficial or deep (fascia or muscle) incision but 
not from within the organ or space component of the 
surgical site; (2) pain or tenderness, localised swelling, 
redness, heat, or fever, or several of these symptoms, and 
the incision is opened deliberately or spontaneously 
dehisces; or (3) abscess within the wound (clinically or 
radiologically detected).
Organ space infections were recorded separately and 
defined as intra-abdominal or pelvic infections detected 
clinically or symptomatically, radiologically, or intra-
operatively. A mandatory online SSI training module was 
completed by all collaborators before data collection.
The secondary outcome measures were designed to 
describe the clinical effect of SSI and included: (1) 30-day 
postoperative mortality, defined as death any time after 
skin closure until 30 days after surgery;17 (2) prevalence 
in perioperative antibiotic administration; (3) 30-day 
postoperative reintervention incidence (operative, radio- 
logical, or endoscopic reintervention any time after skin 
closure until 30 days after surgery); (4) the prevalence of 
antimicrobial resistance for SSI (microbiological culture 
of wound swabs from site of SSI done according to local 
protocols, with a pragmatic definition of antimicrobial 
resistance defined a priori as resistance to the anti- 
microbial drug used for prophylaxis for that procedure in 
that particular patient); and (5) in-hospital SSI incidence

519
(patients were reviewed for SSI during their stay and at 
the time of hospital discharge); and (6) overall 30-day SSI 
incidence (patients were assessed at 30 days to determine 
whether an SSI had occurred; follow-up was done 
in person, by telephone, or by review of medical/
readmission records, dependent on local practices).
Statistical analysis
As described in the protocol,11 consideration was given 
to the sample size needed to compare HDI groups. This 
was approximated because data describing SSI 
incidence internationally are lacking. Taken with data 
from the GlobalSurg 1 study,13 for a baseline SSI 
incidence of 15%, 550 patients per group (1350 patients 
in total after accounting for potential missing data and 
loss to follow-up) would allow for a 6·5 percentage point 
difference to be detected with a power of 80% at an α 
significance level of 0·05.
Variation between different international health settings 
was assessed by stratifying countries with participating 
centres into tertiles according to the Human Development 
Index (HDI). The HDI is the UN’s composite statistic of 
life expectancy, education, and income indices. Differences 
between HDI tertiles were tested with the Pearson χ² test 
for categorical variables and with the Kruskal-Wallis test 
for continuous variables. Bayesian multilevel logistic 
regression models were constructed to account for casemix 
(differing patient, disease, and operative characteristics), as 
previously described.18 Briefly, non-informative priors were 
used with sensitivity analyses done on alternative priors 
and different chain initiation points or chain lengths. 
Models were constructed using the following principles: 
(1) variables associated with outcome measures in previous 
studies were accounted for; (2) demographic variables were 
included in model exploration; (3) population stratification 
by hospital and country of residence was incorporated as 
random effects with constrained gradients; (4) all first-
order interactions were checked and included in final 
models if found to be influential; (5) final model selection 
was done using a criterion-based approach by minimising 
the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) and 
discrimination determined using the c-statistic (area under 
the receiver operator curve). Model coefficients are 
presented as odds ratio (OR) and 95% credible intervals 
(CI; analogous to confidence intervals in frequentist 
statistics, but philosophically distinct). In a further analysis, 
a restricted cubic spline transformation was applied to the 
continuous representation of the HDI to account for 
potential non-linearity (three knots distributed equally 
across the range of HDI rank). This was substituted into 
the final multilevel model (generalised additive model) and 
posterior predictions were made for specified covariate 
levels with 95% CI determined. All analyses were done 
using the R Foundation Statistical Program version 3.1.1 
and Stan A C++ Library for Probability and Sampling 
version 2.10.0. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.

Results
Between Jan 4, 2016, and July 31, 2016, 13 265 patient 
records were submitted for analysis. 726 (5·5%) records 
remained incomplete after quality control, leaving 
12 539 records for the final analysis (figure 1). These 
patients were from 343 centres across 66 countries 
(15 countries in Africa, 16 countries in Asia, 22 countries in 
Europe, eight countries in North America, one country in 
Oceania, and four countries in South America; table 1). 
7339 (58·5%) patients were from countries with high HDI, 
3918 (31·2%) patients were from countries with middle 
HDI, and 1282 (10·2%) patients were from countries with 
low HDI. 1291 (10·3%) patients were children (aged 
16 years or younger). Missing data were uncommon 
(appendix p 12), and no patterns were seen when 
comparing included and missing data (appendix pp 13, 14).
The most common operations were cholecystectomy 
(4412 [35·2%] of 12 539 patients) and appendicectomy 
(4179 [33·3%]; appendix p 1). 6117 (48·8%) patients had 
emergency surgery, 5887 (46·9%) patients had an open 
approach, and a surgical safety checklist was used before 
8843 (70·5%) cases (table 1). Overall, 9922 (79·1%) 
operations were clean–contaminated, 1540 (12·3%) 
operations were contaminated, and 991 (7·9%) operations 
were dirty.

1538 (12·3%) patients had SSI within 30 days of 
surgery, and 842 (6·7%) had SSI before discharge from 
hospital (appendix p 5). The unadjusted SSI incidence 
varied between countries with high HDI (691 [9·4%] of 
7339 patients), middle HDI (549 [14·0%] of 3918 patients) 
and low HDI (298 [23·2%] of 1282 patients). 
Intraoperative contamination was more likely to be 
classed as dirty in countries with low HDI (181 [14·1%] of 
1282 patients) than in countries with middle HDI 
(236 [6·0%] of 3918 patients) or high HDI (574 [7·8%] of 
7339; table 1). SSI rates increased significantly with dirty 
surgery compared with clean–contaminated surgery; 
however, there was no significant interaction for SSI 
between 
HDI 
and 
intraoperative 
contamination 
(appendix pp 3, 4). After multivariable adjustment for 
confounders (including contamination), a significantly 
higher SSI rate was seen in countries with low HDI 
(adjusted OR 1·60, 95% CI 1·05–2·37; p=0·030) but not 
in middle-HDI settings (1·12, 0·77–1·61; p=0·539) 
compared 
with 
high-HDI 
countries 
(figure 
2; 
appendix p 4). When adjusted for patient and hospital 
factors, SSI increased markedly at the threshold between 
countries with middle and low HDI (rank 100; figure 3). 
The increase was observed for both clean–contaminated 
and dirty surgery because there was no significant 
interaction between contamination and HDI, suggesting 
that HDI is an independent risk factor for SSI, 
irrespective of intraoperative contamination.

235 (1·9%) patients died within 30 days of surgery, but 
mortality varied between countries with high HDI 
(110 [1·5%] of 7339 patients), middle HDI (64 [1·6%] of 
3918 patients), and low HDI (61 [4·8%] of 1282 patients; 
appendix p 5). Patients with SSI were more likely than 
patients without SSI to die, to have a reintervention, to 
have an organ space infection, or to have another health-
care-associated infection (table 2). The median length of 
hospital stay was three times longer for patients with an 
SSI than for patients without (median 7·0 days [IQR 11·0] 
vs 2·0 days [4·0]; p<0·001).
Patients in LMICs were more likely to receive presurgery 
antibiotic courses than patients in high-HDI settings 
(appendix p 6). Prophylactic antibiotic administration was 
generally high (10 225 [81·5%] of 12 539 patients), with slight 
variation between HDI groups. Overall, administration of 
preoperative or prophylactic antibiotics, or both, was higher 
in groups with low HDI (1224 [95·5%] of 1282) than in 
countries with middle HDI (3392 [86·6%] of 3918 patients) 
and high HDI (6446 of 87·8%] of 7339 patients; p<0·001).
Patients in LMICs were more likely to receive 
postoperative antibiotics than those in high-HDI countries 
(3376 [46·0%] of 7339 patients in high-HDI countries vs 
3135 [80·0%] of 3918 patients in middle-HDI countries vs 
1098 [85·6%] of 1282 patients in low-HDI countries; 
p<0·001; appendix p 7). The increased tendency to use 
antibiotics after surgery in low-HDI countries persisted 
despite adjustment for confounding factors (adjusted 
OR 4·37, 95% CI 1·65–11·85, p=0·002), including 
contamination of surgery (appendix pp 8, 9). Courses of 
postoperative antibiotics were longer in patients in LMICs 
than in high-income countries, with the number of patients 
receiving antibiotics for 5 days or more increasing from 
countries with high HDI to low HDI (1830 [24·9%] of 
7339 patients in high-HDI countries vs 1837 [46·9%] 
of 3918 patients in middle-HDI countries vs 650 [50·7%] of 
1282 patients in low-HDI countries; p<0·001; appendix p 7).
A microbiological wound culture was available for 
610 (39·7%) of 1538 patients with an SSI (table 3). A 
summary and full lists of causative organisms are available 
in the appendix (pp 10, 11). 301 [63·8%] of 472 patients had 
bowel-derived infections, 97 (20·6%) patients had skin-
derived infections, and 53 (11·2%) patients had infections 
of mixed origin. Organisms with resistance to the actual 
prophylactic antibiotic used were isolated from 132 (21·6%) 
of the 610 patients with SSI who had a wound culture 
(table 3). The prevalence of resistance varied between 
countries with high, middle, and low HDI (table 3).
Patients were identified for inclusion predominately 
using theatre logbooks or computer systems (5771 [78·6%] 
of 7339 patients in high-HDI countries; 2349 [60·0%] of 
3918 patients in middle-HDI countries; 759 [59·2%] 
of 1282 patients in low-HDI countries) and operating 
lists (1318 [18·0%] of 7339 patients in high-HDI countries; 
823 [21·0%] of 3918 patients in middle-HDI countries; 
278 
[21·7%] 
of 
1282 
patients 
in 
low-HDI 
countries; 
appendix 
p 16). Many patients across HDI strata were followed 
up by telephone (2708 [36·9%] of 7339 patients in 
high-HDI countries; 2582 [65·9%] of 3918 patients in 
middle-HDI countries; 483 [37·7%] of 1282 patients 
in low-HDI countries; appendix p 17). Validators 
identified 1476 cases that fulfilled inclusion criteria, and 
1378 (93%) cases were ascertained (appendix p 18). 
Accuracy was high for the validated continuous predictor 
(Pearson’s correlation coefficient 0·99; appendix p 20), 
categorical predictors (Cohen’s κ coefficients >0·90; 
appendix p 21), and mortality (κ 0·91). The agreement for 
30-day reintervention was lower (κ 0·65).
Discussion
We identified both the burden and clinical effect of SSI 
on patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery in many 
parts of the world. SSI affected 12·3% of patients 
worldwide, and the incidence increased across HDI 
groups, reaching 39·8% of patients undergoing dirty

surgery in low-HDI settings. The incidence of SSI 
remained higher in low-HDI countries than in 
middle-HDI or high-HDI countries, despite adjustment 
for factors describing patients, diseases (including 
contamination), procedures, safety, and hospitals. Length 
of hospital stay was three times longer for patients 
affected by SSI than for patients with no SSI. Delayed 
return to work or school carries a societal burden, which 
is likely to be greater in LMICs.
These findings begin to characterise the relationship 
between SSI and global antimicrobial resistance. Where 
microbiological cultures were available, SSIs were more 
likely to be caused by bowel-derived organisms. Large 
amounts of antibiotics were consumed to prevent and 
treat SSI, yet in 21·6% of cases with a positive culture, 
the causative microorganism was resistant to the 
prophylactic antibiotics that had been administered. The 
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance increased to one 
of three isolates in low-HDI countries. Postoperative 
courses of antibiotics were longest for patients in 
low-HDI countries, and this was not explained by 
casemix. Although there is randomised evidence that 
short postoperative antibiotic courses are as safe as long 
antibiotic courses, this evidence was not derived in 
LMICs, and caution is needed before changing practice.19 
The high prevalence of SSIs that were resistant to the 
initial prophylactic antibiotic illustrates a potentially 
important area for improvement worldwide. Complete 
microbiological analysis of all SSIs was not possible 
within this observational study, so the problem might be 
even larger that estimated here.
The focus in global surgery to date has been directed 
towards mortality. The 30-day mortality in this study was 
similar to that in the GlobalSurg 1 study (1·9% and 
1·6% respectively).13 This generally low mortality 
highlights the importance of studying more common 
outcomes such as SSI across health systems, given the 
impact on patients. We found an association between 
SSI and death, with a three-fold increase from 1·5% in 
patients without SSI to 4·7% in patients with SSI within 
this study. This is an association, and no causal link can 
be made with these data; it is likely that patients died 
with an SSI rather than from an SSI. Since SSI was also 
associated with deep organ space infection and other 
health-care-associated infections, this supports its use as 
a severity marker of illness.
Interest in the use of surgical safety checklists has 
increased in the past 5 years, and they are now part of 
clinical routine in many surgical units. In this study, the 
failure to use an available surgical safety checklist was 
associated with a high SSI rate. This association was not 
explained by an omission of prophylactic antibiotics, nor 
was it particular to emergency surgery, when haste might 
improperly trump safety measures. The scientific 
literature describing checklists and SSI is contrasting 
and includes a recent systematic review of 14 studies.14 
The data in this systematic review showed a decrease in 
Figure 3: Probability of surgical site infection (SSI) by human development index (HDI) rank
Adjusted predicted probability of SSI across HDI rank by intraoperative contamination. In the most developed 
countries (rank 1), patients had a low probability of SSI. At rank 100, the probability of SSI increases linearly 
through the least developed countries. This absolute difference between clean–contaminated and contaminated or 
dirty surgery is shown, with no interaction between HDI and intraoperative contamination found. Shaded area is 
the credible interval.

SSI with checklist use (range within individual studies 
from 3·2% to 10·2% absolute risk reduction). The 
GlobalSurg studies provide novel checklist data from 
LMIC settings. The explanation for the observed effect is 
unclear but probably describes a broader attitude to 
safety in hospital systems that require further 
investigation.
A major strength of this study is its provision of 
prospective patient-level SSI data from a wide breadth of 
settings around the world. In particular, outcome 
assessment was standardised and training provided 
through our online tool. Several small and generally 
single-centre studies have been done in the past 20 years 
in attempts to characterise SSI in LMICs. These were 
systematically reviewed in a 2010 study1 that included 
57 reports focusing on SSI. General methodological 
quality was low and heterogeneity was high, with 
reported SSI rates varying from 0·4% to 30·9%. Since 
then, SSI outcomes from several single-centre and 
national multicentre studies in LMICs have been 
published.20–24 The lower than expected rates emphasise 
the difficulty in robustly determining SSI, which, 
together with the between-study variability, make 
international comparisons difficult. The present study 
contributes to closing this knowledge gap and allows 
meaningful comparison from multiple income settings 
with accurate casemix adjustment and standardised 
training in outcome assessment. Reliability was 
increased through the vetting of incomplete records and 
was demonstrated in a parallel validation study.
A major limitation of this study was the inability to 
follow up every patient 30 days after surgery. SSI 
detection within randomised trials is higher when 
proactively followed up as a primary endpoint than when 
followed up as a secondary outcome.25 Within our study, 
collaborators were trained and encouraged to directly 
determine 30-day outcomes whenever possible. Overall, 
this was successful; however, complete, in-person, 30-day 
follow-up for thousands of patients would not have been 
possible, particularly in resource-limited settings. 
Nevertheless, we did assess SSI as a primary endpoint, 
used a mandatory training package, and did a sensitivity 
analysis using in-hospital SSI rates. The variation in 
incidence of SSI before discharge from hospital and 
within 30 days was similar between countries of high, 
middle, and low HDI. Since these incidence data are 
already 
comparable 
to 
those 
from 
high-quality 
randomised trials, this provides some measure of 
validity.26 Other limitations apply. First, with respect to 
microbiological analysis, we did not standardise 
specimen collection, laboratory assessment, techniques, 
or definitions. A pragmatic view was taken to use local 
protocols and techniques for collecting and processing 
specimens and for determining antimicrobial resistance. 
These measures were therefore recognised in advance as 
being an exploratory analysis to describe the prevalence 
of organisms with antimicrobial resistance against the 
particular prophylactic antibiotic administered. Second, 
although we did validation, there is still the potential for 
missed cases or inaccurate data.13,27,28 The large number of 
patients, a prospective protocol, and the use of local 
coordinators might have minimised the potential bias.
Reducing SSI will contribute to ensuring safe and 
essential surgery around the world.29 Costs to patients in 
LMICs in terms of expenditure and time off work have 
not been measured but are probably considerable. 
The costs of preventive measures might be offset 
by the realised cost-savings. WHO has published 
recommendations to help reduce the incidence of SSI 
that include global perspectives relevant to LMICs.9 
Despite inclusion of strongly graded recommendations, 
none of these could be based on high-quality evidence, 
which is lacking in support of most interventions. 
Virtually none of the existing evidence is derived from 
LMICs, leading to uncertainty about future performance 
of these measures.8 SSI research is complex, and bundles 
of measures have been seen to paradoxically increase 
SSI incidence.30 Implementation therefore necessitates 
careful consideration and meticulous attention to 
longer-term evaluation. In resource-limited settings, the 
development of robust policy will remain difficult 
without high-quality evidence. Our findings provide the 
rationale to plan, fund, and perform high-quality surgical 
research that can effect change in health policy. There are 
no multicentre, multi-country randomised trials on SSI 
prevention in LMICs at a time when efforts to combat 
SSI should be informed by high-quality research derived 
in these settings.8
