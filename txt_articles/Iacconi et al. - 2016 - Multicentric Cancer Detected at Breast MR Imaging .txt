Purpose:
To review the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and 
pathologic features of multicentric cancer detected only 
at MR imaging and to evaluate its potential biologic value.
Materials and 
Methods:
This retrospective study was institutional review board ap-
proved and HIPAA compliant; informed consent was waived. 
A review of records from 2001 to 2011 yielded 2021 patients 
with newly diagnosed breast cancer who underwent biopsy 
after preoperative MR imaging, 285 (14%) of whom had ad-
ditional cancer detected at MR imaging that was occult at 
mammography. In 73 patients (3.6%), MR imaging identified 
87 cancers in different quadrants than the known index can-
cer, constituting the basis of this report. In 62 of 73 patients 
(85%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 75, 92), one additional 
cancer was found, and in 11 of 73 (15%; 95% CI: 8, 25), mul-
tiple additional cancers were found. A x2 test with adjustment 
for multiple lesions was used to examine whether MR imag-
ing and pathologic features differ between the index lesion 
and additional multicentric lesions seen only at MR imaging.
Results:
Known index cancers were more likely to be invasive than 
MR imaging–detected multicentric cancers (88% vs 76%, P 
= .023). Ductal carcinoma in situ (21 of 87 lesions [24%]; 
95% CI: 15, 36) represented a minority of additional MR 
imaging–detected multicentric cancers. Overall, the size of 
MR imaging–detected multicentric invasive cancers (median, 
0.6 cm; range, 0.1–6.3 cm) was smaller than that of the in-
dex cancer (median, 1.2 cm; range, 0.05–7.0 cm; P = .023), 
although 17 of 73 (23%) (95% CI: 14, 35) patients had larger 
MR imaging–detected multicentric cancers than the known 
index lesion, and 18 of 73 (25%) (95% CI: 15, 36) had MR 
imaging–detected multicentric cancers larger than 1 cm. MR 
imaging–detected multicentric cancers and index cancers dif-
fered in histologic characteristics, invasiveness, and grade in 
27 of 73 (37%) patients (95% CI: 26, 49). In four of 73 (5%) 
patients (95% CI: 2, 13), MR imaging–detected multicentric 
cancers were potentially more biologically relevant because 
of the presence of unsuspected invasion or a higher grade.
Conclusion:
Multicentric cancer detected only at MR imaging was in-
vasive in 66 of 87 patients (76%), larger than 1 cm in 18 
of 73 patients (25%), larger than the known index cancer 
in 17 of 73 patients (23%), and more biologically impor-
tant in four of 73 women (5%). An unsuspected additional 
multicentric cancer seen only at MR imaging is likely clin-
ically relevant disease.

BREAST IMAGING: Multicentric Cancer Detected at Breast MR Imaging and Not at Mammography 
Iacconi et al
reviewed these 285 MR imaging exami-
nations and determined that 73 (25%) 
had cancer located in a separate quad-
rant or more than 4 cm away from the 
index lesion. All mammograms were 
reviewed by the same radiologist (C.I.) 
to confirm that the cancers were mam-
mographically occult and classify the 
index cancers according to the Breast 
Imaging and Reporting Data System. 
According to the Breast Imaging and 
Reporting Data System, breast density 
was retrospectively and qualitatively 
assessed (11).
The 73 patients with multicentric 
cancer that was only depicted at MR 
imaging constitute the basis of this 
report. All patients underwent mam-
mography less than 6 months before 
or 2 weeks after breast MR imaging. 
Our group of patients did not undergo 
breast US before MR imaging.
US was not routinely performed 
before MR imaging, but it was used to 
evaluate patients after MR imaging and 
guide biopsy if findings were visible. 
All patients underwent mastectomy. 
Exclusion criteria included breast MR 
imaging performed for positive mar-
gins (18 of 285 patients [6%]), neo-
adjuvant chemotherapy [four of 285 
patients, 
1.5%], 
no 
mammogram 
for evaluation [three of 285 patients, 
reduction rates of local recurrence af-
ter breast-conserving surgery (9). This 
may signify that additional MR imag-
ing–detected disease that is occult at 
mammography is not biologically im-
portant or may potentially be treated 
with radiation and/or chemotherapy 
(9,10). Additional disease may not be 
biologically relevant. In general, it is 
accepted that radiation therapy can 
likely treat invasive cancer of less than 
1 cm, although trials that assess pri-
mary radiation therapy for treatment 
of breast cancer are scarce. Additional 
controversy surrounds the detection 
of additional ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS), as many DCIS lesions may not 
progress to invasion. Less disputed is 
the need to treat invasive cancer. The 
purpose of this study was to review the 
MR imaging and pathologic features of 
multicentric cancer detected only at 
MR imaging and to evaluate its poten-
tial biologic value.
Materials and Methods

compliant, and informed consent was 
waived. The hospital database was 
searched for women who underwent 
breast MR imaging between January 
2001 and December 2011 where at least 
one additional suspicious lesion was de-
tected and percutaneous biopsy that 
yielded cancer was performed within 6 
weeks of MR imaging. A total of 2021 
patients fit these criteria. Of these, 285 
of 2021 (14%) were found to have mam-
mographically occult additional cancer 
that was only depicted at MR imaging.

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Multicentric cancers that were 
detected only at MR imaging and 
not at mammography were most 
frequently invasive carcinomas 
smaller than 1 cm (median size, 
0.6 cm; range, 0.1–6.3 cm), 
although in 25% (18 of 73; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 15, 36) 
of patients they were larger than 
1 cm.
 
n Multicentric cancers that were 
detected only at MR imaging 
were larger (1.3 cm; range, 0.2–
5.0 cm) than the known index 
cancer in 17 of 73 patients (23%; 
95% CI: 14, 35).
 
n Two of 73 patients (3%; 95% CI: 
0.3, 10) had unsuspected multi-
centric invasive cancer in the 
setting of a known ductal carci-
noma in situ, altering the disease 
stage, and two of 73 patients 
(3%; 95% CI: 0.3, 10) had un-
suspected multicentric invasive 
cancer of a higher histologic 
grade in the setting of known 
invasive index cancer.
Implication for Patient Care
 
n Multicentric cancer detected at 
breast MR imaging that is occult 
at mammography appears to rep-
resent a larger tumor burden in 
approximately one-quarter of 
patients and can upstage the 
diagnosis, resulting in potential 
changes in treatment.
B
reast magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging is the most sensitive 
technique for depicting breast 
cancer, with widespread applications in 
screening of high-risk patients and pre-
operative planning (1–3). In younger 
women and those with dense breasts, 
MR imaging depicts additional disease 
that is occult at mammography and ul-
trasonography (US), both in the same 
and contralateral breast, and is consid-
ered more accurate for evaluating the 
extent of tumor (4,5). The reported 
incidence of additional MR imaging–de-
tected disease in the ipsilateral breast 
is 3%–34%, and it is 3%–24% in the 
contralateral breast (6,7). However, the 
clinical importance of additional disease 
detected at MR imaging is debated.
Recent trials suggest that the addi-
tion of MR imaging to traditional imag-
ing makes no difference in reoperation 
rates (8). In addition, preoperative 
MR imaging may not change short-
term patient outcomes in terms of

ipsilateral breast, ER staining was not 
performed.
Statistical Methods
The x2 test was used to examine whether 
MR imaging features are different be-
tween additional lesions and the index 
lesion, with correction proposed by Rao 
and Scott (16) that accounts for multi-
ple lesions in patients. The pathologic 
lesion sizes of the index lesion and ad-
ditional lesions were compared with the 
general estimating equations method, a 
robust covariance matrix, and an inde-
pendent correlation structure assum-
ing binomial distribution and using the 
logit link function to take into account 
multiple lesions per patient. Ninety-five 
percent exact binomial confidence in-
tervals were calculated for percentages 
in patients. P , .05 was considered to 
indicate a significant difference. All sta-
tistical analyses were performed with 
SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and 
STATA/IC 13.0 (StataCorp, College Sta-
tion, Tex) software packages.
Results
Of 285 patients with additional mam-
mographically occult cancer detected 
at MR imaging, 73 (26%; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI]: 21, 31) were found 
to have 87 additional lesions that were 
proved to represent cancer in a sepa-
rate quadrant from that of the index 
cancer. In 58 of 73 patients (79.5%; 
95% CI: 68, 88), the clinical indication 
for MR imaging was preoperative evalu-
ation, and in 15 of 73 patients (20.5%; 
95% CI: 12, 32), it was results of high-
risk screening. The median age was 53 
years (range, 31–79 years). Sixty-two 
of 73 patients (85%; 95% CI: 75, 92) 
had one additional cancer that repre-
sented multicentric disease, and 11 of 
73 (15%; 95% CI: 8, 25) had multiple 
additional cancers. Nine patients had 
two additional cancer sites, and two 
had three additional disease sites in 
separate quadrants.
Additional cancers were found in 
heterogeneously or extremely dense 
breasts in 59 of 73 patients (81%; 95% 
CI: 70, 89), and in 14 of 73 patients 
(19%; 95% CI: 11, 30), they were found 
without preoperative biopsy or local-
ization. In these patients, anatomic 
landmarks and MR imaging mutiplanar 
reconstruction were used for revision.
Pathologic Analysis
All available hematoxylin-eosin and 
immunostained slides from surgical 
resection were reviewed (L.G., with 
1 year of experience in breast and 
anatomic pathology). Lesions were 
assessed for size, tubule formation, 
nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic count 
in 10 high-power fields, and necrosis 
of invasive carcinoma. The modified 
Scarff-Bloom-Richardson grade was 
calculated, and the presence of lym-
phovascular invasion was recorded 
(13). Invasive carcinoma was classi-
fied as having ductal, lobular, or mixed 
features on the basis of morphologic 
characteristics. Nuclear grade (low, in-
termediate, or high), architectural pat-
tern, and the presence of necrosis in 
DCIS and carcinoma in situ with mixed 
ductal and lobular features were also 
evaluated. Size was only evaluated in 
patients with invasive cancer.
The status of estrogen receptor 
(ER), progesterone receptor, and hu-
man epidermal growth factor receptor 
type 2 (HER2) was recorded. Invasive 
carcinomas that were positive for ER 
and progesterone receptor staining in 
at least 1% of cells were regarded as 
being positive for these markers ac-
cording to the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology/College of Ameri-
can Pathologists guidelines (14). HER2 
staining and HER2 fluorescence in situ 
hybridization results were recorded as 
negative, equivocal, or positive accord-
ing to the American Society of Clinical 
Oncology/College of American Pathol-
ogists guidelines (15). If multiple foci 
of invasive carcinoma were present in 
a breast, staining was performed in all 
foci of invasive carcinoma that appeared 
morphologically dissimilar. ER staining 
was performed in DCIS if it was the 
worst lesion in a mastectomy or lump-
ectomy specimen without associated 
microinvasive carcinoma. When foci of 
DCIS were found in a mastectomy spec-
imen in a patient with an established 
diagnosis of invasive carcinoma in the 
1%], mammographic evidence of ad-
ditional disease in a location similar to 
that seen at MR imaging [54 of 285 
patients, 19%], additional disease in 
the same quadrant or less than 4 cm 
from the index cancer [124 of 285 pa-
tients, 43.5%], and an inability to cor-
relate additional MR imaging–detected 
disease with the histopathologic report 
[nine of 285 patients, 3%]).
Breast MR Imaging Methods
Breast MR imaging was performed with 
patients in the prone position and with 
a 1.5-T (n = 62) or 3-T (n = 11) imager 
and a dedicated breast coil. In our insti-
tution, patients were randomly assigned 
to a 1.5- or 3-T machine for both diag-
nostic and MR imaging–guided biopsy. 
The standard imaging protocol included 
a localizing sequence followed by sagit-
tal T2-weighted fat-suppressed, sagittal 
T1-weighted without fat suppression, 
and bilateral simultaneous sagittal T1-
weighted 
fat-suppressed 
sequences 
performed before and three times after 
intravenous administration of a bolus of 
0.1 mmol/L of gadopentetate dimeglu-
mine (Magnevist; Bayer, Wayne, NJ) 
per kilogram of body weight. Imager 
types and sequence acquisition param-
eters were previously reported (1,12). 
Section thickness was 3 mm.
MR Imaging Analysis
Breast MR imaging findings were de-
scribed as having mass or nonmass 
enhancement, and morphologic and 
kinetic characteristics were evaluated 
according to the Breast Imaging and 
Reporting Data System (12). Kinetic 
evaluation was performed with Senti-
nelle Aegis 2.0.1 (Sentinelle Medical, 
Toronto, Canada) and a segmentation 
threshold of 80%.
Twenty-two of 87 (25%) additional 
multicentric MR imaging–detected can-
cers were biopsied with US guidance, 
31 of 87 (36%) were biopsied or lo-
calized with MR imaging guidance, 
and 34 or 87 (39%) additional lesions 
were reviewed by a pathologist and a 
radiologist, who correlated MR imaging 
findings with pathologic sections and 
the pathologic report for women who 
were undergoing planned mastectomy

whereas the index cancer was grade II 
DCIS. In two of 73 patients (3%), MR 
imaging–detected multicentric cancer 
was a higher grade than the invasive 
index cancer. In one patient, the in-
dex invasive ductal cancer (IDC) and 
DCIS were grade II (2.9 cm), with an 
additional grade III index IDC and DCIS 
lesion (0.3 cm), and in the other pa-
tient, the index lesion was grade 1 IDC 
and grade II DCIS (1.3 cm), with an 
additional grade II invasive lobular can-
cer and grade III DCIS (1 cm) (Fig 2). 
 
In seven of 73 patients (10%; 95% CI: 
4, 19), the grade of additional MR im-
aging–detected invasive cancers was 
lower than that of the index lesion.
Overall, there was no statistical dif-
ference in histologic grade between in-
dex invasive cancers and MR imaging–
detected multicentric invasive cancer 
following sizes: less than 1 cm in 55 
of 73 patients (75%; 95% CI: 64, 85), 
1.1–2.0 cm in 12 of 73 patients (16%; 
95% CI: 9, 27), and more than 2 cm 
in six of 73 patients (8%; 95% CI: 3, 
17). Purely DCIS was identified in 21 of 
87 lesions (24%; 95% CI: 15, 36) and 
represented a minority in nine of 73 pa-
tients (12%; 95% CI: 6, 22).
In 17 of 73 patients (23%; 95% CI: 
14, 35), MR imaging–detected multi-
centric cancer had the same histologic 
type and grade but was larger than the 
index cancer. In these patients, the 
median difference in size between the 
index cancer and additional MR imag-
ing–detected cancer was 3 cm (range, 
0.2–5.0 cm). In two of 73 patients (3%, 
95% CI: 0.3, 10), MR imaging–detected 
multicentric cancer was grade III inva-
sive cancer (size, 0.4 cm and 0.7 cm), 
in breasts that were classified as pre-
dominantly fatty or having scattered fi-
broglandular tissue. At mammography, 
breasts were predominantly fatty in two 
of 73 patients (3%; 95% CI: 0.3, 10), 
contained scattered fibroglandular tis-
sue in 12 of 73 patients (16%; 95% CI: 
9, 27), were heterogeneously dense in 
47 of 73 patients (64%; 95% CI: 52, 
75), and were extremely dense in 12 of 
73 patients (16%; 95% CI: 9, 27).
Index cancers were identified at 
mammography in 70 of 73 patients 
(96%; 95% CI: 88, 99) and were mam-
mographically occult in three of 73 pa-
tients (4%; 95% CI: 1, 12), manifest-
ing as palpable abnormalities. Of the 
70 index cancers that were visible at 
mammography, 39 (56%; 95% CI: 43, 
68) were masses, 11 (16%; 95% CI: 8, 
26) were distortion, 10 (14%; 95% CI: 
7, 25) were calcifications, seven (10%; 
95% CI: 4, 20) were masses and calcifi-
cations, four (6%; 95% CI: 2, 14) were 
asymmetries, and two (3%; 95% CI: 
0.3, 10) were masses and distortion.
Index cancers were more frequently 
invasive than the MR imaging–detected 
multicentric cancers (88% vs 76%, 
respectively; P = .023), although the 
majority of additional MR imaging–de-
tected multicentric cancers were inva-
sive (Table 1). MR imaging–detected 
multicentric cancers were more likely 
to be purely DCIS without invasion 
than were index cancers (24% vs 12%, 
respectively) (Fig 1). The size of addi-
tional MR imaging–detected invasive 
disease measured at pathologic analysis 
was smaller than that of the index can-
cer (median, 0.6 cm; range, 0.1–6.3 cm 
vs median, 1.2 cm; range, 0.05–7.0 cm, 
respectively; P = .023) (Table 2). Index 
cancers were more likely to be a mass 
at breast MR imaging than were MR 
imaging–detected multicentric cancers 
(72% vs 48%, respectively; P = .002) 
and were more often described as het-
erogeneous or rim enhancing than were 
MR imaging–detected multicentric can-
cers (P = .004).
MR imaging–detected multicentric 
cancers that were located in a separate 
quadrant represented invasive cancer 
in the majority of patients (56 of 73 
[77%]; 95% CI: 65, 86) and were the

BREAST IMAGING: Multicentric Cancer Detected at Breast MR Imaging and Not at Mammography 
Iacconi et al
cancers larger than 2 cm were found in 
women with extremely dense breasts, 
and 55 of 71 (77%) MR imaging–de-
tected multicentric cancers smaller 
than 2 cm were found in women with 
heterogeneously dense breasts.
Discussion
Breast MR imaging can depict more 
disease than mammography in both 
the ipsilateral and contralateral breasts 
(3,5,17). In 1985, Holland et al (18) 
showed that 20% of patients with unifocal 
clinical or mammographic cancer smaller 
than 2 cm who underwent mastectomy 
had additional cancer that was mammo-
graphically occult and clinically unsus-
pected, a figure that increased to 43% 
among patients with primary tumors 
larger than 2 cm. Although additional 
disease was found at histologic analysis 
in 63% of mastectomy specimens, this 
finding poorly correlates with the low 
incidence of local treatment failure in 
women who undergo breast-conserving 
treatment because additional nonsurgi-
cal treatment of the breast is designed to 
sterilize any residual disease (19).
In our study, although MR im-
aging–detected multicentric cancers 
were more commonly discovered in 
heterogeneously or extremely dense 
breasts (80%), these cancers occurred 
in many women with fatty breasts or 
index cancer and additional MR imag-
ing–detected cancers (P = .381) (Table 
2). Among index cancers, there was no 
difference in kinetics between invasive 
and DCIS-only cancers.
Additional MR imaging–detected 
cancers were found across all breast 
densities, and it appears that breast 
density is not associated with the size 
of additional lesions (P = .214). Four of 
six MR imaging–detected multicentric 
(P = .297) and between index cancers 
with both DCIS and invasion and MR 
imaging–detected multicentric cancers 
composed of DCIS (P = .245). Finally, 
no difference was noted in the receptor 
status between the index cancer and 
additional MR imaging–detected inva-
sive cancers (P = .380) (Table 2).
For the 28 patients in whom recep-
tor status data for all cases were known, 
there was no difference between the

in the inferior quadrants (DCIS). The additional lesions were not visible at US and were biopsied with MR imaging guidance.

BREAST IMAGING: Multicentric Cancer Detected at Breast MR Imaging and Not at Mammography 
Iacconi et al
may have depicted some of the mul-
ticentric lesions. Furthermore, many 
(39%) MR imaging–detected multicen-
tric cancers were not biopsied before 
mastectomy because many high-risk 
patients opted to undergo mastectomy 
rather than breast-conserving therapy, 
limiting our histopathologic validation 
of lesions. Finally, MR imaging was per-
formed on both 1.5- and 3-T machines, 
and magnet differences may have af-
fected our results.
The majority of additional cancers 
seen only at MR imaging represent 
small-volume disease and may possibly 
be treated with current treatment algo-
rithms. However, beyond the index can-
cer, additional MR imaging–detected 
cancers that are larger than 1 cm and, 
especially, invasive may not be reliably 
treated with breast-conserving therapy; 
such lesions were found in 23% (17 of 
73; 95% CI: 14, 35) of our patients. We 
believe that invasive cancer larger than 
1 cm is clinically relevant. In approxi-
mately three-quarters of the patients in 
this series, MR imaging–detected mul-
ticentric cancers that represent DCIS 
or invasive cancer smaller than 1 cm 
could, arguably, result in overtreatment 
and more aggressive surgical treat-
ment, whereas 3% (two of 73; 95% CI: 
0.3, 10) of patients had unsuspected in-
vasive cancer in the setting of DCIS, re-
sulting in underdiagnosis and, possibly, 
improve surgical planning and patient 
outcomes (20).
The reported treatment failure rate 
for breast conservation at 10 years is 
approximately 5%–10%, a figure that 
supports the argument that most of 
the additional disease detected at MR 
imaging is successfully treated with 
nonsurgical methods (a combination 
of whole-breast radiation therapy, che-
motherapy, and/or hormone therapy) 
(19). Our findings support that current 
therapy likely treats small amounts of 
additional disease, as the majority of 
additional invasive disease was less 
than 1 cm and DCIS, which is gener-
ally treated with radiation therapy. 
Confounding the known treatment fail-
ure rate of breast carcinoma was the 
incidence of larger, invasive tumors at 
sites beyond that of the index cancer 
in our series. In our analysis, additional 
invasive cancers that were 1.1–2.0 cm 
were found in 16% of women (12 of 73; 
95% CI: 9, 27), and invasive cancers 
larger than 2 cm were found in 8% of 
women (six of 73; 95% CI: 3, 17). Con-
sidering local recurrence rates, it may 
be that the larger, invasive cancers are 
incompletely treated and result in local 
treatment failure.
A limitation of our study is the ret-
rospective nature of the data. In addi-
tion, US was not routinely performed 
before preoperative MR imaging and 
with scattered fibroglandular densities 
(20%). Additional disease detected only 
at MR imaging was more frequently 
represented by small subcentimeter in-
vasive cancers and DCIS. However, in 
76% of cases, it represented invasive 
cancer, and in approximately one-quar-
ter of cases, it was larger than 1 cm.
In 17 of 73 patients (23%; 95% CI: 
14, 35), MR imaging–detected multicen-
tric cancers were larger than the index 
cancer, possibly changing the disease 
stage. In 27 of 73 patients (37%; 95% 
CI: 26, 49), an MR imaging–detected 
multicentric cancer differed from the 
index cancer with respect to invasion, 
grade, and/or receptor status. In two 
of 73 patients (3%; 95% CI: 0.3, 10), 
the grade of the additional MR imag-
ing–detected invasive cancer was high-
er than that of the index cancer, and in 
two of 73 patients (3%; 95% CI: 0.3, 
10), the additional MR imaging–detect-
ed cancer was smaller than 1 cm and 
invasive, while the index cancer was 
DCIS, possibly changing the patient’s 
treatment options.
MR imaging played an important 
role in the assessment of disease ex-
tent, depicting more extensive disease 
in 17 of 73 patients (23%; 95% CI: 14, 
35). A more accurate preoperative as-
sessment of disease, especially for ad-
ditional MR imaging–detected disease 
larger than 1 cm (median, 3 cm) may

of the left breast. B, Mediolateral oblique screening mammogram (left) shows the left breast, and dynamic sagittal MR image (right) of the left breast shows a 
1.3-cm index lesion (grade I CDI and grade II DCIS). C, dynamic sagittal MR image shows an additional 1-cm lesion (grade II CLI and grade III DCIS). D, US image 
shows both lesions (the index lesion, located at the 12 o’clock position, 3 cm from the nipple, and an additional lesion, located at the 11:30–12 o’clock position, 
7.5 cm from the nipple) and was used to guide biopsy.

undertreatment, and 3% (two of 73; 
95% CI: 0.3, 10) had additional cancer 
with a higher histologic grade.
In summary, having a majority of 
patients undergo potential overtreat-
ment versus a minority who may be 
undertreated is at the heart of the con-
troversy surrounding the use of breast 
MR imaging. Patient decisions for diag-
nosis and treatment may depend on the 
relative weight placed on either of these 
options.
