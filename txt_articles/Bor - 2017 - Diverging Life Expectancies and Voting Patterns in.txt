 Diverging Life Expectancies and Voting Patterns in
the 2016 US Presidential Election
Jacob Bor, SD
Objectives. To assess whether voting patterns in the 2016 US presidential election
were correlated with long-run trends in county life expectancy.
Methods. I examined county-level voting data from the 2008 and 2016 presidential
elections and assessed Donald Trump’s share of the 2016 vote, change in the Republican
vote share between 2008 and 2016, and changes in absolute numbers of Democratic and
Republican votes. County-level estimates of life expectancy at birth were obtained for
1980 and 2014 from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.
Results.Changes in county life expectancy from 1980 to2014 were strongly negatively
associated with Trump’s vote share, with less support for Trump in counties experi-
encing greater survival gains. Counties in which life expectancy stagnated or declined
saw a 10-percentage-point increase in the Republican vote share between 2008 and 2016.
Conclusions. Residents of counties left out from broader life expectancy gains
abandoned the Democratic Party in the 2016 presidential election. Since coming to
power, the Trump administration has proposed cuts to health insurance for the poor,
social programs, health research, and environmental and worker protections, which are
key determinants of population health. Health gaps likely will continue to widen without
significant public investment in population health. (Am J Public Health. 2017;107:1560–
1562. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2017.303945)

T
he election of Donald Trump was fueled
in part by a sense of disenfranchisement
and economic marginalization. However,
economic indicators do not fully capture the
divergence in well-being across the United
States. To what extent did voting patterns
map onto growing health divides? Life
expectancy gaps across US counties have
widened in the past 3 decades, with many
counties increasingly left behind.1–4 I assessed
the association between changes in county
life expectancy from 1980 to 2014 and
voting patterns in the 2008 and 2016
presidential elections.
METHODS
County-level voting data from the 2008
and 2016 presidential elections were obtained
from the Atlas of US Presidential Elections,5
which aggregates data from state electoral
commissions. I assessed Trump’s share of the
2016 vote, the change in the Republican vote
share between 2008 and 2016, and changes
in absolute numbers of Democratic and
Republican votes. I chose 2008 as the com-
parison year because it was the most recent
presidential election with no incumbent.
Votes for third-party candidates were
excluded. County-level estimates of
life expectancy at birth were obtained for
1980 and 2014 from the Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluation, the longest time
series of county life expectancy estimates
publicly available.4,6 The change in life
expectancy was calculated as the difference
between 1980 and 2014 life expectancies,
capturing the period described in recent
studies of county health disparities.4,7
Associations between changes in life
expectancy and voting patterns were assessed
graphically and in multivariable regression,
adjusting for county demographic and eco-
nomic characteristics: state, rural/metropoli-
tan, percentage with a college degree, income
inequality, unemployment, median home
value, share in poverty, economic mobility,
percentage Black, and percentage Hispanic.2

representing the size of the 2016 voting
population in each county and moving
averages with 95% confidence intervals.
RESULTS
Voters in counties in which life expectancy
stagnated or declined between 1980 and 2014
were much more likely to vote for Trump
(Figure 1a). Nationally, life expectancy
increased by 5.3 years during this period.
In counties with below-average gains in
life expectancy, a majority of voters chose
Trump; in counties with above-average gains
in life expectancy, most voters chose
Hillary Clinton. The weighted correlation
between the change in life expectancy
and the proportion voting for Trump was
–0.67 (P < .001).
These patterns do not just represent
long-run differences in party affiliation.
Figure 1b displays the change in the county
vote share for the Republican candidate
between 2008 (John McCain vs Barack
Obama) and 2016 (Trump vs Clinton).
The 781 counties in which life expectancy
increased by less than 3 years during 1980
through 2014 saw a 9.1-percentage-point
increase in the Republican vote share.

 Democrats saw a 3.5-percentage-point
increase in vote share in counties in which
life expectancy gains exceeded 7 years. In
a regression context, for each additional
year of life expectancy gain, the change in
Republican vote share was 2.3 percentage
points lower (95% CI = –2.6, –2.0).
Adjusting for state fixed effects, rural status,
percentage college educated, county eco-
nomic characteristics, and racial/ethnic
composition reduced the estimate of the
coefficient to zero (Table A, available as
a supplement to the online version of this
article at http://www.ajph.org). These
findings suggest that the change in life ex-
pectancy was not an independent causal factor
in the shift in Republican vote share. Nev-
ertheless, residents of many counties voting
for Trump have been left out of the broader
life expectancy gains of the past 3 decades.
The change in vote share reflects both
changes in voter turnout and changes in
preferences among those who cast votes.
Overall, from 2008 to 2016, Republicans
lost 67 000 votes in counties with above-
average life expectancy trends but gained
3.1 million votes in counties with below-
average life expectancy trends. During the
same period, Democrats gained 1.4 million
votes in counties with above-average life
expectancy gains but also lost 5.0 million
votes in counties with below-average
life expectancy gains—a 14% relative
decline in the number of Democratic votes
in those counties. The total number of
votes for the 2 major parties increased by
1.3 million in counties with above-average
life expectancy gains and fell by 1.9 million
in counties with below-average life
expectancy gains. In counties with low
survival gains, the number of votes lost by
the Democrats exceeded the number of
votes gained by the Republicans.
DISCUSSION
Residents of counties left out from
broader life expectancy gains abandoned
the Democratic Party in the 2016 presi-
dential election, turning to Trump or not
voting at all. Residents of these counties
are hurting, experiencing not just eco-
nomic insecurity, but also persistently
high mortality rates, highlighting the
need for real material investments in
population health and its determinants.
These findings are consistent with prior
reports that voting behaviors were correlated
with a broad index of poor health and the
rising opioid epidemic.8 Factors implicated
in diverging life expectancy across US
counties include widening gaps in economic
opportunity,9 changing burdens of chronic
disease risk factors,4 the emergence of the
opioid epidemic,10 and disparities in access
to medical care.11 An important limitation
of this analysis is that comparisons across
counties ignore differences in life expectancy

PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS
Life expectancy has stagnated or declined
in many US counties, even as other counties
have experienced large gains in survival. Will
the Trump administration and Republican
Congress enact policies that improve pop-
ulation health in the counties where their
voters reside? In its opening months, the new
administration has proposed massive cuts to
health insurance for the poor, to social pro-
grams such as food stamps, to public health
and medical research, to occupational safety
monitoring, and to environmental protection

house.gov/files/omb/budget/fy2018/budget.
pdf and https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/
22/us/politics/trump-budget-cuts.html).
Health gaps are likely to continue to widen
without public investment in the conditions
that support population health.7
