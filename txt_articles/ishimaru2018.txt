Background: Improving patients’oral hygiene is an option for preventing postoperative pneumonia that
may be caused by aspiration of oral and pharyngeal secretions. Whether preoperative oral care by a
dentist can decrease postoperative complications remains controversial. A retrospective cohort study
was undertaken to assess the association between preoperative oral care and postoperative complications
among patients who underwent major cancer surgery.
Methods: The nationwide administrative claims database in Japan was analysed. Patients were identified
who underwent resection of head and neck, oesophageal, gastric, colorectal, lung or liver cancer between
May 2012 and December 2015. The primary outcomes were postoperative pneumonia and all-cause
mortality within 30 days of surgery. Patient background was adjusted for with inverse probability of
treatment weighting using propensity scoring.
Results: Of 509 179 patients studied, 81 632 (16⋅0 per cent) received preoperative oral care from a dentist.
A total of 15 724 patients (3⋅09 per cent) had postoperative pneumonia and 1734 (0⋅34 per cent) died
within 30 days of surgery. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, preoperative oral care by a
dentist was significantly associated with a decrease in postoperative pneumonia (3⋅28 versus 3⋅76 per cent;
risk difference − 0⋅48 (95 per cent c.i. −0⋅64 to−0⋅32) per cent) and all-cause mortality within 30 days of
surgery (0⋅30 versus 0⋅42 per cent; risk difference − 0⋅12 (−0⋅17 to −0⋅07) per cent).
Conclusion: Preoperative oral care by a dentist significantly reduced postoperative complications in
patients who underwent cancer surgery.

Introduction
Pneumonia is a common and sometimes fatal complica-
tion after major cancer surgery. The reported incidence
of postoperative pneumonia ranges from 2⋅6 to 3⋅5 per
cent1–3. Previous studies4,
5 have shown significant asso-
ciations between postoperative pneumonia and both pro-
longed length of hospital stay and mortality.
Oral care is one option for preventing postoperative
pneumonia as postoperative pneumonia can be precipitated
by aspiration of oral and pharyngeal secretions6. Biofilms
(a group of micro-organisms) on the surface of the teeth
and tongue can be a reservoir of respiratory pathogens7.
The mechanical removal of biofilms may be effective in
reducing pathogens8.
In this context, oral care by dentists, has recently
attracted attention for the prevention of in-hospital pneu-
monia. Studies have shown oral care by dentists to be
significantly better than routine oral care in terms of
reducing ventilator-associated pneumonia9,
10. However, it
remains unclear whether preoperative oral care can reduce
postoperative pneumonia and mortality. Several studies
have suggested that preoperative oral care might be asso-
ciated with a decrease in postoperative pneumonia after
cardiac11 or cancer12–14 surgery, but these were limited by
small sample sizes and a small number of participating insti-
tutions. The present study used a nationwide database in
Japan to examine the association between preoperative oral
care by dentists and postoperative pneumonia and all-cause
mortality in patients who underwent cancer surgery.

Health Insurance Claims in Japan. The details of this
database have been described elsewhere15,
16. Briefly, it is
an all-patient administrative claims database developed
by Japan’
s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare that
covers more than 126 million people and 1⋅9 billion claims
annually. The database includes almost all residents who
received medical care services under the universal health
insurance system in Japan. The database contains infor-
mation on patient age, sex, diagnoses, and inpatient and
outpatient medical and dental service use. Procedures and
medications are coded with the original Japanese codes.
Diagnoses can be linked to ICD-10 codes. Data for the
present study were collected from April 2011 to March
2016. The Institutional Review Board at the University of
T
okyo approved the study protocol.
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, or in planning the design
or implementation of the study; or asked to advise on the
interpretation or writing up of the results. There are no
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study par-
ticipants or to the relevant patient community.
Patients
Patients who underwent surgery for head and neck,
oesophageal, gastric, colorectal, lung or liver cancer
between May 2012 and December 2015 were identified.
Patients were monitored 12 months before surgery until
the day of discharge from hospital or the end of the study
(31 March 2016).
In Japan, approximately 1600 advanced hospitals partic-
ipate in the lump-sum payment system for inpatients (the
Diagnosis Procedure Combination per diem payment sys-
tem). Most major cancer surgery in Japan is performed in
these advanced hospitals and therefore it was decided to
include patients from these hospitals only. Excluded were
hospitals that did not provide any patient with preoperative
oral care by a dentist.
The following exclusion criteria were also applied:
patients aged less than 18 years; those first enrolled in the
database within 12 months of cancer resection (this interval
also served as a baseline period for evaluating previous
co-morbidities and treatments); those who remained in
hospital on the last day of the observation period (31
March 2016); those diagnosed with pneumonia at admis-
sion; those without cancer in the primary diagnosis at
admission; those who underwent cancer surgery on day 30
or later after admission; and those who underwent cancer
surgery without general anaesthesia. For patients who had
two or more cancer resections, only the primary surgery
was included in the present analysis.
Exposure and outcomes
Preoperative oral care by a dentist for patients undergo-
ing cancer surgery under general anaesthesia is reimbursed
by the universal healthcare insurance in Japan. It was there-
fore possible to identify patients who received preoperative
oral care from a dentist by confirming the specific procedu-
ral code for this treatment. When a surgeon requests that a
dentist provide preoperative oral care to a patient with can-
cer, the dentist checks the patient’
s oral condition, provides
professional mechanical tooth cleaning, teaches the patient
self-cleaning methods for the teeth, and provides any treat-
ment needed. Patients were identified who received preop-
erative oral care from a dentist within 30 days of surgery.
The primary outcomes in the present study were postop-
erative pneumonia and all-cause mortality within 30 days
of surgery during the hospital stay. Postoperative pneu-
monia was identified from the diagnoses recorded after
admission with the following ICD-10 codes: J12–J18
(pneumonia), J69 (pneumonitis caused by solids or liquids)
and J95⋅8–J95⋅9 (postprocedural respiratory disorders).
Propensity score analyses
Propensity score (PS) analyses were performed to compare
the rate of the primary outcomes between patients who
received preoperative oral care from a dentist and those
who did not. T
o estimate the PS for receiving preoperative
oral care from a dentist, a multivariable logistic regression
model was used that included demographic characteristics,
diagnoses, prescription information, procedures, num-
ber of dental clinic visits, number of medical outpatient
clinic visits and number of hospital admissions during the
baseline period. Demographic characteristics included:
age, sex, year, prefecture code of the institution, hospital
volume, cancer site, type of cancer resection, and any dif-
ficulty with general anaesthesia. In the Japanese healthcare
reimbursement system, difficulty with general anaesthesia
is defined as the patient being obese (BMI over 35 kg/m2)
or having any of the following conditions: heart failure,
ischaemic heart disease, valvular disease, serious arrhyth-
mia requiring a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter
defibrillator, congenital heart disease, pulmonary hyper-
tension, respiratory failure, asthma, uncontrolled diabetes,
renal failure, liver failure, serious anaemia, coagulopathy,
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation,
sepsis,
shock,
spinal cord injury, or status requiring cardiopulmonary
support or renal replacement therapy. Hospital volume
was defined by the mean number of patients at each
hospital who received eligible cancer resections per year.
This variable was assessed in volume groups by quartile:
low (142 or fewer per year), medium–low (143–254 per

year), medium–high (255–401 per year) and high (402
or more per year). Eighty-five codes for types of cancer
resection were identified and these data were extracted
from the database. The diagnoses included 160 ICD-10
codes. The prescription information included 139 types of
medicine. A total of 59 types of procedure were included.
Variables that included fewer than 1000 patients from
the PS estimation model were excluded. Details of the
variables used for calculating the PS are documented in
Appendix S1 (supporting information). T
o measure the
goodness of fit of the model, the C-statistic was calculated.
Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) anal-
yses were performed using the treated weight17. T
o test the
balance of the distribution of co-variables between patients
with and without preoperative oral care by a dentist after
applying IPTW, the absolute standardized difference for
each co-variable was calculated. A standardized difference
of more than 10 per cent was defined as out of balance.
The balance of the following co-variables was checked:
demographic
characteristics,
preoperative
diagnoses
(hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, ischaemic
heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
chronic liver disease, cerebrovascular disease, renal failure,
dental caries, periodontitis and ill-fitting denture plate),
the number of preoperative medical outpatient clinic visits,
the number of preoperative hospital admissions and the
number of preoperative dental clinic visits.
Statistical analysis
Weighted Student’
s t tests with bootstrapped standard
errors were used to compare mean values between the
groups with and without preoperative oral care by a dentist.
T
o evaluate the associations between preoperative oral
care by a dentist and the postoperative outcomes, general-
ized linear models were estimated with identity link using
robust sandwich variance estimation18. Subgroup analyses
were carried out to assess the differences in the association
of preoperative oral care by a dentist with outcomes for
each type of cancer. The PS estimation was repeated and
generalized linear models stratified by type of cancer. Gen-
eralized linear models were also repeated with addition of
variables for type of cancer (head and neck, oesophageal,
gastric, colorectal, lung or liver cancer) and interaction
terms between preoperative oral care by a dentist and type
of cancer. For each analysis, risk differences and 95 per
cent confidence intervals for postoperative complications
were calculated for patients with and without preopera-
tive oral care by a dentist. The threshold for significance
was P ≤ 0⋅050. All analyses were performed using R version
3.0.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,
Austria) and Oracle® R Enterprise version 1.4.1 (Oracle,
Redwood Shores, California, USA).
Sensitivity analyses
Seven sensitivity analyses were undertaken. In the first of
these, the exposure definition was changed, restricting the
period of preoperative oral care by dentists to 7 days before
cancer surgery. The second analysis was carried out after
exclusion of patients who underwent cancer surgery 7 or
more days after hospital admission. In the third analysis,
the outcome definition of postoperative pneumonia was
changed, by addition of the prolonged use of antimicrobial
agents for intravenous infusion after cancer surgery. Here,
prolonged use was defined as at least 3 days after cancer

The sixth analysis comprised an assessment of mortality
including both in-hospital death and death after discharge
within 30 days of surgery because the database included

Results
Data were extracted on 780 389 patients who underwent
cancer surgery in advanced hospitals in Japan. Of these,
271 211 were excluded according to the exclusion criteria,
and the remaining 509 179 patients from 741 advanced
hospitals were eligible for study. Of these eligible patients,
81 632 (16⋅0 per cent) received preoperative oral care from
dentists (Fig. 1).
Overall, 15 724 patients (3⋅09 per cent) had postoperative
pneumonia and 1734 (0⋅34 per cent) died within 30 days of
cancer resection. Some 396 variables were included in the
final PS estimation model. The C-statistic for the goodness
of fit was 0⋅75 in the PS model.
The unweighted and IPTW baseline characteristics of
patients are described in Table 1. Patients were more likely
to receive preoperative oral care from a dentist if they had
oesophageal cancer, were being treated in a recent year, had
a preoperative dental visit, were treated at a hospital with a
lower volume, and had dental caries. Patients with head and
neck cancer were less likely to receive preoperative oral care
from a dentist. In the IPTW estimations, the absolute val-
ues of the standardized difference were less than 10 per cent
for all baseline characteristics. The mean length of hospital
stay was significantly different between patients with and
without preoperative oral care by a dentist in the IPTW
estimation (21⋅5 versus 22⋅3 days respectively; P < 0⋅001).
Table 2 shows risk differences for postoperative pneu-
monia and all-cause mortality within 30 days of surgery
between patients who did and did not receive preoperative
oral care from a dentist. In the IPTW estimation, pre-
operative oral care by a dentist was associated with a sig-
nificantly lower proportion of diagnoses of postoperative
pneumonia (3⋅28 versus 3⋅76 per cent; risk difference − 0⋅48
(95 per cent c.i. −0⋅64 to −0⋅32) per cent; P < 0⋅001) and
lower all-cause mortality rate within 30 days of surgery
(0⋅30 versus 0⋅42 per cent; risk difference − 0⋅12 (−0⋅17 to
−0⋅07) per cent; P < 0⋅001).
The results of subgroup analyses stratified by cancer site
are shown in Table 3. Among patients with oesophageal,

gastric and colorectal cancer, preoperative oral care by a
dentist was significantly associated with a lower rate of
postoperative pneumonia and all-cause mortality within
30 days of surgery. The interaction term between preop-
erative oral care by a dentist and oesophageal cancer was
significant.
The overall results remained unchanged in all the sensi-
tivity analyses (Table 4).
Discussion
This nationwide retrospective cohort study of 509 179
patients who underwent major cancer surgery investigated
the association between preoperative oral care by a den-
tist and postoperative complications. The IPTW method
was used to adjust for numerous confounding factors. The
results showed that receiving preoperative oral care from a
dentist was significantly associated with a reduction in post-
operative pneumonia and all-cause 30-day mortality.
The incidence of postoperative pneumonia in this study
(3⋅09 per cent) was consistent with that reported in pre-
vious studies1–3; however, the in-hospital mortality rate
within 30 days of surgery in this study (0⋅34 per cent) was
lower than reported previously (0⋅9–7⋅6 per cent)1,
21,
22.
Several Japanese studies23–25 reported that the in-hospital
mortality rate after lung cancer resection was lower in
Japan than in other countries, possibly because an increase
in early-stage cancer detection and also minimally inva-
sive surgery may have contributed to a decrease in early
postoperative deaths.
The question of whether preoperative oral care by a
dentist can decrease postoperative complications remains
controversial, because insufficient evidence has been pro-
vided in previous studies11–14,
26. In existing studies12,
14,
which are limited by small sample size or lack of adjust-
ment for confounders, the odds ratios for postoperative
pneumonia in patients with oesophageal cancer receiving
preoperative oral care from a dentist ranged from 0⋅21
to 0⋅37. No study has reported a significant association
between preoperative oral care and all-cause mortality. A
previous study27 in the USA evaluated the reduction in
postoperative pneumonia after a multidisciplinary strat-
egy including incentive spirometry, coughing and deep
breathing, oral care (brushing teeth and using mouthwash
twice daily), understanding (patient and family educa-
tion), getting out of bed at least three times daily and
head-of-bed elevation, and reported the risk reduction
for postoperative pneumonia to be 1⋅0 per cent (ranging

 Preoperative oral care and postoperative complications after major cancer surgery
from 1⋅6 to 2⋅6 per cent) after its implementation. The
present nationwide Japanese study, which focused on the
association between preoperative oral care by a dentist
and postoperative complications, found a 0⋅48 per cent
risk reduction for postoperative pneumonia and a 0⋅12 per
cent risk reduction for all-cause mortality within 30 days
of surgery among patients who underwent major cancer
surgery with preoperative oral care by a dentist.
The results of the present subgroup analyses indicated
that preoperative oral care by a dentist was associated with
a decrease in postoperative complications among patients
who underwent oesophageal, gastric or colorectal cancer
surgery. However, these results should be interpreted with
caution. The interaction term between preoperative oral
care and oesophageal cancer was only just significant.
Therefore, the effects of preoperative oral care by a dentist
on postoperative complications may be greater in patients
with oesophageal cancer than in those with other types of
cancer.
The problems of overfitting and M-structures in PS
estimation models remain controversial28,
29. However, a
recent simulation study28 reported that the accuracy in
effect estimation was acceptable if the number of exposed
patients was sufficient. Reduction of biases was more
important than excluding some variables to avoid overfit-
ting, even though the variables may have been related to
the exposure or outcome28,
30. In practice, M-bias gener-
ally seems to be small, relative to conventional confound-
ing bias30,
31. All available factors were therefore included
as potential confounding factors, except for variables that
included fewer than 1000 patients.
In this study, there was a significant association between
preoperative oral care by a dentist and both postoperative
pneumonia and all-cause 30-day mortality. The findings
suggest that preoperative oral care by a dentist may be ben-
eficial for patients undergoing cancer surgery, even if they
were intubated temporarily. Furthermore, this study can
contribute to improving the prevention of postoperative
pneumonia. Previously reported strategies for preven-
tion of postoperative pneumonia include oral care such
as tooth brushing by non-dental professionals or using
chlorhexidine only3,
27,
32. Preoperative oral care is generally
performed by patients themselves or by nursing staff mem-
bers; however, these people do not have enough training to
remove biofilms from the teeth, tongue and oral mucosa,
and they cannot remove dental calculus and biofilms in the
periodontal pockets, which are reservoirs of pathogens7,
33.
The involvement of dentists in the preoperative manage-
ment of patients who are undergoing cancer surgery may
be essential for decreasing postoperative complications.
This article presents the results of a nationwide study
evaluating the associations between preoperative oral care
by a dentist and postoperative complications. The study
analysed approximately 500 000 patients, representing
almost all those undergoing major cancer surgery in Japan.
It was possible to adjust for numerous factors to elimi-
nate potential confounders, including several previously
reported confounding factors (age, sex, hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, pulmonary disease, type of surgery and
poor general condition)34–38.
The present study had several limitations. Recorded
diagnoses and procedures are not well validated in admin-
istrative data. A previous validation study39 showed that
recorded diagnoses had high specificity but lower sensitiv-
ity, whereas documented medications and procedures had
high sensitivity and specificity. Because the intervention
of preoperative oral care by a dentist was not standard-
ized, the quality of the procedures was dependent on the
specific hospital or dentist. No data were obtained on
several potential confounders, including BMI, smoking
status and functional dependency34–37. The results may
not be generalizable to other countries because the study
included only Japanese patients. In addition, chlorhexidine
rinses at concentrations of more than 0⋅005 per cent have
been prohibited in Japan because of allergic reactions, but
rinses at chlorhexidine concentrations of 0⋅12–0⋅2 per
cent have been reported to prevent ventilator-associated
pneumonia40,
41. It is possible that surgeons who allocated
patients to receive preoperative oral care were more likely
to diagnose postoperative pneumonia or were more likely
to instigate care to prevent postoperative pneumonia.
However, such a confounding by indication may have
caused an underestimation of the effect of preoperative
oral care and it would not alter the conclusions.
The present study showed that preoperative oral care
by a dentist was associated with a significant decrease in
postoperative pneumonia and all-cause 30-day mortality
following cancer resection among the population defined
by the Japanese nationwide database. The findings could
help improve strategies for the prevention of postoperative
complications.
