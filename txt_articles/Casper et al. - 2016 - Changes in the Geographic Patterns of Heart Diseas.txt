S
urveillance studies of heart disease mortality in the United 
States have documented important temporal trends by race, 
sex, and age group during the past 4 decades.1–3 Little attention, 
however, has been given to temporal changes in the geographic 
patterns of heart disease mortality during this time period. The 
earliest published map, depicting heart disease death rates by 
state during the early 1950s, documents geographic dispari-
ties with the highest rates located primarily in the Northeast.4 
Subsequent studies that use a variety of geographic units (eg, 
county, state economic area, health service area, state) have 
documented geographic disparities in the rates and the rates 
of decline in heart disease mortality at various times,4–13 but no 
studies have systematically monitored changes in the pattern of 
geographic disparities in heart disease mortality among US com-
munities during this extended time period. Small-area surveil-
lance of heart disease mortality is important because it can reveal 
patterns that are masked at the national level, give communities 
the historical context for understanding their current burden of 
heart disease, and inform the development of hypotheses regard-
ing the geographic disparities in heart disease mortality.

Clinical Perspective on p 1180
The ability to generate statistically stable rates for geo-
graphic units with small populations has been a challenge to 
small-area surveillance of heart disease mortality. Relatively 
recent developments in statistical methodologies, in particu-
lar, the application of Bayesian techniques,14 have enhanced 
the ability to produce statistically rigorous and stable heart 
disease mortality estimates at the local level. In this study, 
we use a spatiotemporal Bayesian model to examine the 
geographic patterns of heart disease mortality among US 
counties from 1973 to 2010. A similar model was used by 
Quick and colleagues15 in an analysis of asthma hospitaliza-
tion rates in California counties. We document 3 dimensions 
of the spatiotemporal trends in county-level heart disease 
mortality in the United States: (1) changing geographic pat-
terns of heart disease mortality over time; (2) geographic 
variation in rates of declining heart disease mortality; and 
Background—Although many studies have documented the dramatic declines in heart disease mortality in the United States 
at the national level, little attention has been given to the temporal changes in the geographic patterns of heart disease 
mortality.
Methods and Results—Age-adjusted and spatially smoothed county-level heart disease death rates were calculated for 
2-year intervals from 1973 to 1974 to 2009 to 2010 for those aged ≥35 years. Heart disease deaths were defined according 
to the International Classification of Diseases codes for diseases of the heart in the eighth, ninth, and tenth revisions of 
the International Classification of Diseases. A fully Bayesian spatiotemporal model was used to produce precise rate 
estimates, even in counties with small populations. A substantial shift in the concentration of high-rate counties from the 
Northeast to the Deep South was observed, along with a concentration of slow-decline counties in the South and a nearly 
2-fold increase in the geographic inequality among counties.
Conclusions—The dramatic change in the geographic patterns of heart disease mortality during 40 years highlights the 
importance of small-area surveillance to reveal patterns that are hidden at the national level, gives communities the 
historical context for understanding their current burden of heart disease, and provides important clues for understanding 
the determinants of the geographic disparities in heart disease mortality.   (Circulation. 2016;133:1171-1180. DOI:

ity among counties.
Methods
Data Sources
The study population includes all residents of the contiguous United 
States aged ≥35 years. Annual numbers of heart disease deaths per 
county were obtained from the National Vital Statistics System of the 
National Center for Health Statistics. We analyzed data from 1973 to 
2010, because this period ensures complete rather than sampled death 
records. Deaths from heart disease were defined as those for which 
the underlying cause of death was diseases of the heart according 
to the of the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth, Ninth, 
and Tenth Revision (ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10; ICD-8 [1973–1978]: 
390–398, 402, 404, 410–429; ICD-9 [1979–1998]: 390–398, 402, 
404, 410–429; ICD-10 [1999–present]: I00–I09, I11, I13, I20–
I51).16,17 The comparability ratios between each ICD revision are very 
close to unity for diseases of the heart; therefore, no adjustments for 
ICD coding changes were necessary (ie, comparability ratios=1.0126 
and 0.9858 for ICD-8–9 and ICD-9–10, respectively).16,17 Annual 
population counts were obtained from the bridged-race files produced 
by the US Census Bureau and National Center for Health Statistics.18 
Heart disease death rates per 100 000 were calculated and directly 
age-standardized to the 2000 US Standard Population by using 
10-year age groups.19
Calculating Heart Disease Death Rates and 
Percentage Change
The county is the unit of analysis. Given changes in some county defi-
nitions during the study period, a single set of 3099 counties from the 
contiguous 48 states was used for the entire study period. To enhance 
statistical stability, we aggregated county-level, age-standardized 
counts, and populations into 2-year intervals (eg, from 1973–1974 
to 2009–2010).
To further improve the statistical stability of estimated heart dis-
ease death rates, we used a fully Bayesian spatiotemporal model to 
estimate age-standardized, county-level heart disease death rates. By 
borrowing strength across both space and time, Bayesian models can 
produce precise rate estimates, even in areas with sparse populations. 
Our model, which accounts for temporal correlation of rates within 
a given county and spatial correlation of rates across adjacent coun-
ties, estimates heart disease death rates as a function of spatiotempo-
rally evolving model parameters (see online-only Data Supplement). 
Because Bayesian models output posterior distributions for each 
model parameter, we were able to calculate the posterior distribu-
tion for the expected heart disease death rate for each county at each 
2-year interval. From these posterior distributions, we then obtained 
the posterior median (ie, the frequentist point estimate) and the 95% 
Bayesian credible interval (the Bayesian analog of a classical 95% 
confidence interval) for each county and each 2-year interval. Details 
about our model, including the specification of prior distributions and 
details for its implementation in a Markov chain Monte Carlo algo-
rithm, are provided in the online-only Data Supplement.
To quantify county-specific temporal changes in heart disease 
death rates for the entire study period, we also used the posterior dis-
tributions of the parameter estimates to calculate percentage decline 
from 1973 to 2010. County-level percentage declines were consid-
ered statistically significant if the 95% Bayesian credible interval for 
percentage decline excluded zero.
Quantifying Geographic Disparities in Heart 
Disease Death Rates
To assess statistically significant spatial disparities among counties, 
we generated local indicators of spatial association (LISA) statistics 
for county rates within each time interval and for county percent-
age declines for the entire study period.20 As a local correlate of the 
Moran I, the LISA statistics indicate the degree to which counties 
with higher (or lower) than expected death rates tend to cluster with 
neighboring counties that also have higher (lower) than expected 
death rates. Thus, the LISA statistics highlight patterns of local and 
regional spatial clustering in the heart disease death rates, with statis-
tically significant clustering being identified by counties whose 95% 
Bayesian credible interval for the LISA statistic excludes 0. For ease 
of visualizing spatial patterns, we present maps of both the modeled 
heart disease death rates and the LISA statistics for the beginning and 
end of the study period (Figures 1 and 2). Finally, we measured tem-
poral change in relative geographic inequality in heart disease mortal-
ity among counties by using the coefficient of variation (CoV).21 We 
calculated the CoV because it uses the full distribution of county-
specific rates to measure the amount of geographic inequality rather 
than relying on the tails of the distribution for calculating a disparity 
ratio. The CoV is defined as the standard deviation of county-level 
heart disease death rates for each 2-year time interval divided by the 
mean rate for the respective time period. A large CoV indicates more 
inequality in the rates among counties. We then assessed the temporal 
change (measured as percent change) in the CoV for the entire study 
period.
The Bayesian statistical model used in this analysis to generate 
the county rates and the LISA statistics was implemented using R sta-
tistical software, the maps were created using ESRI ArcMap software 
(version 10.1), and data management was performed using SAS.22–24 
Details for computing all the summary statistics can be found in the 
online-only Data Supplement.
Results
At the beginning of the study period (1973–1974), the larg-
est concentration of high-rate counties (defined as coun-
ties in the top quintile) formed an arc stretching from the 
Northeast through much of Appalachia and into the Midwest 
(Figure 1A). High-rate counties were also concentrated along 
the coastal areas of North Carolina, South Carolina, and 
Georgia. An East-West gradient was apparent with nearly all 
top-quintile counties located in the eastern half of the country 
and the majority of bottom-quintile counties in the western 
half. However, small groups of low-rate counties were also 
observed in Alabama, Florida, and parts of Mississippi. By 
the end of the study period in 2009 to 2010, the strong concen-
tration of high-rate counties in the Northeast had dissipated, 
and a large concentration of high-rate counties emerged in the 
South and southern Appalachia (Figure 1B). The East-West 
gradient was still largely intact with low-rate counties found 
primarily in the West. The declines in heart disease death 
rates that occurred during the study period are reflected in the 
lower quintile cut points in 2009/2010 in comparison with 
1973/1974.
LISA maps depicting statistically significant spatial clus-
ters of high- and low-rate counties further reveal the shift of the 
high-rate counties from the Northeast to the South (Figure 2). 
Whereas most of the high-rate clusters were in the Northeast 
and Midwest at the beginning of the study period, by 2009 to 
2010, the vast majority of high-rate clusters were south of the 
Mason-Dixon line. Geographic changes in the low-rate clus-
ters also occurred, with the disappearance of many low-rate 
clusters from Texas and New Mexico and the appearance of 
low-rate clusters in New England. Low-rate clusters in Florida 
and parts of the Pacific Northwest were maintained during the 
study period.

trend was observed in the Midwest (from 17% to 6%), the 
opposite trend was observed in the South—the percentage of 
high-quintile counties increased from 24% to 38%.
Substantial geographic variation in declining heart dis-
ease death rates was observed during the study period, with 
percentage declines ranging from 9.2% to 83.4% among US 
counties (Figure 4). Counties in the quintile with the slow-
est declines (9.2%–49.6%) were concentrated primarily in the 
southern states of Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, 
Oklahoma, and parts of Texas. Counties in the quintile with 
the fastest declines (64.1%–83.4%) were located largely in 
the northern half of the country with the exception of fast 
declines among counties in Florida and South Carolina. The 
average percentage decline for the United States was 61.6%. 
The LISA map of declining heart disease death rates depicts 
a large southern concentration of counties with slow declines 
and a prominent concentration of fast declines in the Northeast 
(Figure 5).
The magnitude of relative geographic disparity in heart 
disease death rates among counties, as measured by the coef-
ficient of variation, increased briefly during the late 1970s and 
then rose steadily from 1985 to 2010 (Figure 6). The coeffi-
cient of variation increased by an average of 3.62% each year, 
and the magnitude of geographic inequality doubled from the 
beginning to the end of the study period.
Discussion
This spatiotemporal study of heart disease mortality in the 
United States (1973–2010) documents a substantial shift in the 
concentration of high-rate counties from the Northeast to the 
South. The shift was accompanied by geographic disparities 
in the rates of declining heart disease mortality (with the slow-
est declines concentrated primarily among southern counties), 
and a 2-fold increase in the magnitude of geographic dis-
parities among US counties. These observations highlight the 
importance and power of studies of small-area surveillance 
data to identify patterns that are masked at the national level, 
generate hypotheses regarding determinants of the changing 
geographic patterns, and provide information that can be used 
to tailor heart disease prevention programs and policies to 
communities with the greatest burden.
Previous studies provide snapshots of geographic dispar-
ities in heart disease mortality at various points in time using 
a variety of geographic units, age groups, and definitions 
of heart disease.4,6–10 The one consistent pattern is the East-
West gradient, with higher rates concentrated in the East 
and lower rates in the West. Only one other study that we are 
aware of compared the patterns of geographic disparities in 
heart disease mortality over time.10 Similar to our findings, 
but using Health Service Areas and for a shorter time period 
(1979/1981–1991/1993), Pickle and Gillum10 reported a 
southwesterly shift in coronary heart disease death rates for 
white men from West Virginia to the southern sections of 
the Mississippi River Valley. Our study also expands on a 
rich literature documenting geographic disparities in rates 
of declining heart disease mortality in the United States for 
selected time intervals. Studies have documented state-level 
disparities in declining heart disease death rates from 1999 
to 2007,8 geographic disparities among state economic areas 
in the onset of declining heart disease mortality in the 1960s 
and 1970s,12 slower rates of declines among Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas for black women and men in comparison

slowest declines in heart disease mortality, suggest these pat-
terns did not occur randomly. Instead, the results emphasize 
the importance of place for health outcomes26 and suggest that 
there may have been systematic spatiotemporal changes in 
conditions that affect heart disease death rates. Studies have 
identified many interwoven dimensions of place that have 
implications for the burden of heart disease, including social 
and economic conditions,27–29 the built environment,30 healthy 
public policies,31 prevalence of biomedical and behavioral risk 
factors,32,33 and access to quality health care.34,35 Hypotheses 
for understanding the contributing factors to the observed spa-
tiotemporal trends in heart disease mortality will need to con-
sider spatiotemporal trends in these conditions, and migration 
patterns, as well.
Spatiotemporal studies of risk factor prevalences associ-
ated with heart disease mortality are scarce, in large part 
because of the lack of historical risk factor data at the 
local level. Only 3 studies that we are aware of examined 
temporal changes in the following 4 county-level risk fac-
tor prevalences (albeit for much shorter time periods than 
our study): cigarette smoking (1996–2012),36 hypertension 
(2001–2009),37 obesity (2001–2011),38 and physical activ-
ity (2001–2011).38 Each study used small-area estimation 
statistical techniques to generate county-level estimates 
from data that were collected at the state or national lev-
els. Temporal changes in the geographic pattern of cigarette 
smoking showed similarities to the changes we observed 
for heart disease mortality. For instance, counties in the 
Northeast started out with high prevalences of cigarette 
smoking in 1996, but by 2012 the Northeast counties had 
predominantly low prevalences of cigarette smoking.36 
In general, however, these studies reported little change 
in the geographic patterns of these risk factors over time. 
For hypertension, obesity, and physical activity, counties 
with the highest prevalences tended to be concentrated in 
the South at both the beginning and end of the study peri-
ods.37,38 The absence of changes in the geographic patterning 
of these risk factors could reflect the following: (1) study 
periods that are too short to capture meaningful change in 
geographic patterns, (2) imprecision of the statistical tech-
niques, or (3) a true absence of change in the geographic 
patterns of these risk factors.
Spatial and temporal variations in the enactment of 
healthy public policies, ranging from tobacco control 
to housing and transportation, are important to consider 
given the widespread implications these policies have for 
creating and sustaining heart-healthy living and working 
conditions.31 Although historical data about the timing of 
state and local policy implementation can be challenging 
to locate, they can be very informative. For instance, state-
level implementation of smoke-free indoor air legislation 
and increases in excise tax rates on cigarettes were both 
implemented initially in Northeastern and Western states 
during the early 2000s, but by 2014 there was still weak or 
no implementation of these policies in the South.39 Smoke-
free environments may be particularly relevant given evi-
dence that secondhand smoke affects nonsmokers’ risk, and 
thus, population variation could arise independent of the 
overall smoking prevalence.
The time period of this study coincides with major regional 
transitions in labor and industrialization policies in the United 
States. Historians have noted that many of the federal and 
state policies to increase the industrial base in the South often 
had negative implications for the social and economic con-
ditions of the region.40,41 Given the well-documented asso-
ciations between socioeconomic conditions and heart disease 
outcomes and risk factors,27–30 further study is warranted to 
examine the potential contributions of spatiotemporal changes 
in socioeconomic conditions to the spatiotemporal changes 
observed in heart disease mortality.
The near doubling of the magnitude of geographic 
inequality in heart disease mortality among US counties 
is concerning, especially in light of the Healthy People 
2020 goals to reduce disparities in heart disease mortal-
ity.42 Increases in relative geographic disparity were initially 
reported by Wing et al for coronary heart disease mortality 
from 1962 to 1982,43 and have been reported for cardiovas-
cular disease and all-cause mortality in the United States and 
Britain.44–46 Phelan and Link47 demonstrate that widening 
sociodemographic and geographic gaps occur when there 
are large declines in diseases for which successful preven-
tion activities have been established, as is true for heart dis-
ease. They argue that the ability to benefit from advances in 
disease prevention policies and programs is unequally dis-
tributed according to the social and economic standing of 
individuals and communities, thereby leading to differential 
rates of decline and subsequent widening of disparities. The 
potential for high-risk strategies for heart disease preven-
tion (ie, interventions aimed at individual-level changes in 
knowledge, motivation, and behavior) to increase disparities 
in the burden of heart disease has been noted given the dif-
ferential resources available to individuals and communities 
to make and sustain such changes.48
Strengths
An important strength of this study is the use of a fully 
Bayesian spatiotemporal model to produce county-level 
Figure 6. Temporal trend of the coefficient of variation (CoV) for 
age-standardized county-level heart disease death rates, United 
States, from 1973–1974 to 2009–2010. Larger CoV indicates 
greater geographic disparity in heart disease death rates among 
counties.

estimates of heart disease mortality during an extended time 
period. By borrowing statistical strength across both space 
(neighboring counties) and time (the preceding and subse-
quent time intervals), the Bayesian model produces county 
estimates and variances for smaller populations that are 
more precise than other statistical methods.11 Our use of the 
LISA statistic provides an additional measure of statistical 
significance for documenting the spatiotemporal trends in 
heart disease mortality. Furthermore, this study is the first 
consistent and comparable long-term analysis of geographic 
disparities in heart disease mortality from the early 1970s 
through 2010.
Limitations
The reliance on death certificates for studies of geographic 
disparities in mortality poses several limitations. One limita-
tion is the potential for misclassification caused by inaccuracy 
in the cause of death as reported on the death certificate. By 
using the broadest ICD category, diseases of the heart,17 we 
substantially minimized the potential for misclassification 
that exists when death certificates are used to study subtypes 
of heart disease.49,50 Furthermore, the comparability ratios 
between ICD revisions for diseases of the heart are near 1.0, 
indicating no bias from ICD coding changes over time.17 In 
contrast, the comparability ratios for several subtypes of heart 
disease reflect changes in the definitions, especially in the 
early years, which introduces bias into the temporal trends. 
For example, the comparability ratio for coronary heart dis-
ease was only 0.87 between ICD-8 and ICD-9, and, because of 
even larger changes in the definition of heart failure, no com-
parability ratio for heart failure was reported between ICD-8 
and ICD-9.
However, the use of the broad category, diseases of the 
heart, also introduces a limitation—the inability to examine 
whether spatiotemporal trends in heart disease subtypes (eg, 
coronary heart disease [CHD] and heart failure) contributed 
differentially to the overall changes in the geographic pat-
tern of heart disease mortality. Variations in the etiology and 
strength of risk factors by heart disease subtype could have 
implications for the determinants of the patterns observed in 
this study. However, given that CHD accounts for the major-
ity of declines in diseases of the heart (94% of declines in all 
diseases of the heart from 2000 to 2010 were attributable to 
declines in CHD),51 that CHD and heart failure share impor-
tant risk factors and that CHD itself is a very strong risk factor 
for heart failure,52,53 the category diseases of the heart is the 
most practical and reliable definition for studying spatiotem-
poral changes over nearly 40 years.
Another limitation related to the use of death certifi-
cates in this study is the inability to distinguish between 
geographic changes in case fatality versus incidence. 
Changes in case fatality would signal the relative impor-
tance of secondary prevention and access to quality care; 
changes in incidence would point to the relative importance 
of primary prevention. Nationally, >50% of the decline in 
heart disease mortality is estimated to be attributable to 
primary prevention54; however, the proportions could vary 
regionally and locally.
Finally, a limitation of the coefficient of variation is that it 
may be sensitive to potential changes in the skewness of the 
distribution of mortality over time. To test this, we calculated 
the coefficient of dispersion (Q3-Q1/median) and observed a 
nearly identical pattern over time, supporting the use of the 
coefficient of variation for this study.
Conclusion
The sweeping geographic changes in heart disease mortality 
observed over a relatively short period of time, with a shift 
of high-rate counties from the Northeast to the Deep South, 
suggest that systematic changes may have occurred in a 
variety of biomedical, behavioral, and socioenvironmental 
factors. The accompanying regional disparities in declining 
rates of heart disease mortality (with the slowest declines 
occurring predominantly in the South), and a nearly 2-fold 
increase in the geographic gap of heart disease mortality, 
highlight the importance of identifying conditions that are 
contributing to these disparities. Comprehensively docu-
menting spatiotemporal patterns of heart disease mortality 
among communities in the United States, and exploring new 
hypotheses regarding the correlates of the changing geo-
graphic patterns, will enhance our ability to ensure that all 
communities experience optimal declines in heart disease 
mortality and that we narrow the existing geographic dis-
parities in heart disease mortality.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIvE
The dramatic shift in the geographic pattern of heart disease mortality observed in this study has important implications 
for the equitable prevention and treatment of heart disease in the United States. Although dramatic declines in heart disease 
mortality have been observed at the national level, the maps in this study indicate that there have been substantial geographic 
disparities in the rates of decline, with the slowest declines occurring primarily in the southern counties. These disparities 
in declining heart disease death rates contributed to the steady progression of high-rate counties from the Northeast to the 
South, as observed in the animated maps, and resulted in a nearly 2-fold increase in the magnitude of disparity in heart 
disease mortality among counties. These results emphasize the importance of geography for heart disease prevention and 
treatment, provide insights into new hypotheses regarding the determinants of declining heart disease mortality, and provide 
important information for tailoring clinical heart disease prevention and treatment services and policies to the communities 
with the greatest burden.
