Aims: People with serious mental illness are increasingly turning to popular social media, including Facebook, Twitter
or YouTube, to share their illness experiences or seek advice from others with similar health conditions. This emerging
form of unsolicited communication among self-forming online communities of patients and individuals with diverse
health concerns is referred to as peer-to-peer support. We offer a perspective on how online peer-to-peer connections
among people with serious mental illness could advance efforts to promote mental and physical wellbeing in this group.
Methods: In this commentary, we take the perspective that when an individual with serious mental illness decides to
connect with similar others online it represents a critical point in their illness experience. We propose a conceptual
model to illustrate how online peer-to-peer connections may afford opportunities for individuals with serious mental
illness to challenge stigma, increase consumer activation and access online interventions for mental and physical well-
being.
Results: People with serious mental illness report benefits from interacting with peers online from greater social con-
nectedness, feelings of group belonging and by sharing personal stories and strategies for coping with day-to-day chal-
lenges of living with a mental illness. Within online communities, individuals with serious mental illness could
challenge stigma through personal empowerment and providing hope. By learning from peers online, these individuals
may gain insight about important health care decisions, which could promote mental health care seeking behaviours.
These individuals could also access interventions for mental and physical wellbeing delivered through social media that
could incorporate mutual support between peers, help promote treatment engagement and reach a wider demographic.
Unforeseen risks may include exposure to misleading information, facing hostile or derogatory comments from others,
or feeling more uncertain about one’s health condition. However, given the evidence to date, the benefits of online peer-
to-peer support appear to outweigh the potential risks.
Conclusion: Future research must explore these opportunities to support and empower people with serious mental ill-
ness through online peer networks while carefully considering potential risks that may arise from online peer-to-peer
interactions. Efforts will also need to address methodological challenges in the form of evaluating interventions deliv-
ered through social media and collecting objective mental and physical health outcome measures online. A key chal-
lenge will be to determine whether skills learned from peers in online networks translate into tangible and
meaningful improvements in recovery, employment, or mental and physical wellbeing in the offline world.

 with
serious
mental
illnesses
like
schizophrenia,
schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder are turn-
ing to social media to talk about their illness experi-
ences, seek advice and learn from and support each
other (Gowen et al. 2012; Naslund et al. 2014; Miller
et al. 2015). This unsolicited communication occurs nat-
urally and involves self-forming online communities of
individuals who share an understanding of living with
mental illness. Referred to as online peer-to-peer support,
this emerging form of social interaction has been
described as one of the most transformational features
of the Internet (Ziebland & Wyke, 2012) and may pre-
sent new opportunities to promote recovery, self-
esteem and mental and physical wellbeing among
individuals with serious mental illness.
Worldwide, serious mental illness is a leading cause
of disability (Murray & Lopez, 1997) and is associated
with debilitating symptoms of anxiety, depression and
low motivation (Kessler et al. 2003). Being labelled
mentally ill, and the ensuing societal stigma and preju-
dice, can have devastating effects on quality of life,
self-efficacy and ability to pursue meaningful life
goals (Corrigan, 1998). For people with serious mental
illness the effects of stigma, feelings of hopelessness
and helplessness, and resulting social marginalisation
and withdrawal lead to increased risk of substance
use, poverty, homelessness, unemployment, hospital-
isation and suicide (Dixon, 1995; Corrigan, 2004;
Folsom et al. 2005; Pompili et al. 2008). There are also
numerous challenges to addressing these concerns
from a clinical perspective. For example, to reach indi-
viduals with serious mental illness, it is necessary to
overcome barriers such as social isolation, reluctance
to use formal health care services and challenging
social circumstances such as traumatic life events or
disruptive home environments (RachBeisel et al. 1999;
Hert et al. 2011). Online peer networks may offer
novel approaches for supporting and engaging this
high-risk group in treatment efforts.
By early 2015, over 2 billion people globally had
active social media accounts (Kemp, 2015). Social
media refers to interactive web and mobile platforms
through which individuals and communities share,
co-create, or exchange information, ideas, photos, or
videos within a virtual network. Online social network-
ing represents a prominent form of communication in
many people’s lives. For individuals with stigmatised
illnesses, such as serious mental illness, social media
may make it possible to connect with others who
share similar health conditions and to seek or disclose
health information without having to reveal one’s per-
sonal identity (Berger et al. 2005). Additionally, many
people with serious mental illness experience symptoms
that interfere with socialising in face-to-face encounters
(Dickerson et al. 2001). Therefore social media may help
to facilitate social connections among this group by
overcoming obstacles such as stigma and mental health
symptoms (Highton-Williamson et al. 2015).
Research suggests that people with serious mental
illness are interested and willing to form connections
with others through social media. A survey of young
adults found that those with mental illness were
more likely to express personal views through blog-
ging, build friendships on social media and connect
with people online who have shared interests com-
pared with those without mental illness (Gowen et al.
2012). Similarly, another survey found that adults
with schizophrenia were as likely as adults without
mental illness to form social connections online despite
having fewer offline relationships, lower income and
less Internet access (Spinzy et al. 2012). In a qualitative
study, popular social media appeared useful for allow-
ing people with serious mental illness to feel less alone
and to find hope and to support each other, and to
share personal stories and strategies for coping with
day-to-day challenges of living with a mental illness
(Naslund et al. 2014). Other studies have found that
online support groups, forums and chat rooms serve
as important venues for discussing sensitive mental
health conditions (Kummervold et al. 2002), and for
disclosing personal experiences of living with schizo-
phrenia or seeking and sharing information related
to symptoms and medications (Haker et al. 2005).
Despite this mounting evidence, limited attention
has been directed at utilising these online networks
to disseminate materials for mental health education
or support, or to widen access to evidence-based
services among these high-risk individuals. In this
paper we present our perspective on how interactions
among people with serious mental illness over social
media, referred to as online peer-to-peer support, may
afford important opportunities to advance treatment
efforts aimed at promoting mental and physical well-
being in this group. First, we consider the importance
of forming social connections and the role of social
media among people with serious mental illness. Then,
we propose three areas where online peer-to-peer con-
nections may have a profound impact for these indi-
viduals. These include challenging stigma, increasing
consumer activation, and accessing interventions for
mental and physical wellbeing. We carefully consider
the potential risks associated with interacting with
peers online. To conclude, we discuss important chal-
lenges ahead and recommend future research directions.
Online peer-to-peer support and mental illness
Prior studies have emphasised the importance of indi-
viduals feeling connected to others and sharing a sense

 of belonging to a group (Brewer, 1991). Identifying
with a social group is believed to increase self-esteem
and self-efficacy, and reduce uncertainty about oneself
(McKenna & Bargh, 1998). Among people with serious
mental illness, connecting with similar others may con-
tribute to better recovery, personal wellbeing and
social integration (Davidson et al. 1999). Yet, for these
individuals, identifying and reaching out to others
poses numerous risks in the form of disclosure and
potential disapproval, rejection, or negative attitudes
(Link et al. 1997). Many people with serious mental ill-
ness also experience challenges with face-to-face com-
munication due to impairments in cognitive and
social functioning (Dickerson et al. 2001). For someone
with serious mental illness, the decision to reach out
and connect with others to discuss personal health
issues typically occurs at a time of increased instability
and when facing significant life challenges (Perry &
Pescosolido, 2015). Seeking support and social connec-
tion is therefore a critical point in the lives of people
with serious mental illness, and the decision of who
to reach out to may be detrimental in determining
their path to successful recovery and wellbeing.
Through social media, people with serious mental
illness can potentially identify similar others and
experience benefits of group participation at their
own convenience, while remaining anonymous and
avoiding challenges associated with interpersonal defi-
cits such as interpreting social cues or non-verbal com-
munication (Mittal et al. 2007; Highton-Williamson et al.
2015). Social media overcomes geographic boundaries
and time constraints, and allows users to choose
whether or not to actively create content, disclose per-
sonal health information, post comments, or passively
view content posted by others. Research suggests that
within an online network, both individuals who choose
to share content or connect with different users, as well
as those who choose to seek health information without
interacting with others can experience important bene-
fits (van Uden-Kraan et al. 2008; Mo & Coulson, 2010;
Chung, 2014). Compared with spontaneous face-to-face
encounters, social media users maintain greater control
meaning that they can choose their own level of
engagement and the extent to which they interact
with others. This may be especially important for peo-
ple with serious mental illness because social media
may help them overcome debilitating effects of their
illness such as information processing challenges,
increased social anxiety, or difficulties with social inter-
action (Schrank et al. 2010). On social media individuals
with serious mental illness can choose whether to post
content and how quickly to respond to comments, and
can revisit conversations or seek greater clarity at their
own pace. For someone experiencing mental health
symptoms combined with fear of stigma and rejection,
this added control through online communication may
be empowering.
Social media also represents a user-driven environ-
ment, where individuals with Internet access through
their mobile device or computer can have a voice
and the opportunity to express themselves and connect
to a larger online community. Online peer-to-peer net-
works represent a significant contrast to traditional
biomedical or psychiatric approaches to mental health
care. Many people with serious mental illness have
had to fight against discrimination and injustice, and
advocate for basic human rights and mental health
care reform (Tomes, 2006). For this group, social
media may serve as a platform through which many
of these individuals can continue to challenge preju-
diced societal views, question authoritarian medical
practices and share positive attitudes and beliefs.
New opportunities through online peer-to-peer
support
We take the perspective that when an individual with
serious mental illness decides to connect with similar
others online, it represents a critical point in their ill-
ness experience. These individuals are likely facing sig-
nificant personal challenges, social isolation, or fears
about how others will view them, which may prompt
them to seek information or support online. In Fig. 1,
we propose a conceptual model to illustrate how
online peer-to-peer connections may afford individuals
with serious mental illness opportunities to challenge
stigma, increase consumer activation and access online
interventions. Our conceptual model is informed by
existing literature including studies of online commu-
nities and online support groups for mental illness as
well as other patient groups with diverse health condi-
tions, and suggests how individuals with serious men-
tal illness may benefit from peer-to-peer interactions
following the initial decision to visit an online commu-
nity. As depicted in Fig. 1, the proposed opportunities
do not necessarily occur in a sequential order.
Challenge stigma
When individuals with serious mental illness visit an
online community they may be experiencing shame,
uncertainty and feeling alone with their symptoms or
illness diagnosis. These individuals may have fears
about reaching out to others, driven by concerns
about what other people will say or think and the pos-
sibility of rejection because of their illness (Link et al.
1997). When individuals with mental illness internalise
discriminatory societal views and stereotypes, it often
leads to negative consequences including diminished

 self-esteem and self-efficacy, and greater depressive
symptoms (Corrigan, 1998). Stigma impacts an indivi-
dual’s ability to carry out daily activities such as work
or school, to pursue life goals and to seek necessary
mental health care (Link et al. 1997; Corrigan, 1998).
Online communities may serve as powerful venues
where individuals with serious mental illness can chal-
lenge stigma through personal empowerment and pro-
viding hope (Lawlor & Kirakowski, 2014). Studies
have shown that knowing that there are others facing
similar concerns, frustrations and illness symptoms
can be highly reassuring and can create a sense of
belonging to a group (Harvey et al. 2007). Young adults
with mental illness report that one of the primary rea-
sons for connecting with others online is to feel less
alone (Burns et al. 2009), and popular social media
allows people with serious mental illness to feel con-
nected while gaining a sense of relief from knowing
that others share similar experiences and challenges
(Naslund et al. 2014). Research also suggests that true
self can be expressed more easily within online net-
works because the anonymity of the Internet can
shield from disapproval or fear of making mistakes
(Bargh et al. 2002). This is also important because self-
expression may help protect against harmful effects of
stigma (Bargh & McKenna, 2004; Whitley & Campbell,
2014). Therefore, individuals with serious mental ill-
ness may benefit from interacting with others through
social media because they can be themselves without
letting the challenges of their illness get in the way.
Coming out and disclosing one’s illness to others is
also an important approach for addressing stigma
(Corrigan et al. 2010; Corrigan et al. 2013). Through
online peer-to-peer communities, individuals with
serious mental illness can connect with others with
lived experience and openly disclose their own diagno-
sis while choosing to share positive stories of recovery
and facts to challenge stigma and directly address
widespread myths and misperceptions about living
with a mental illness. Research suggests that margina-
lised
individuals
may
benefit
from
feelings
of
empowerment, greater personal identity and pride by
connecting with similar others online (van Uden-Kraan
et al. 2009). The increase in confidence and sense of
belonging gained through selectively disclosing to
others online may even make individuals feel more com-
fortable disclosing their illness in face-to-face encounters
(McKenna & Bargh, 1998). As the number of online for-
ums, blogs, or Facebook groups dedicated to empower-
ing and supporting people living with serious mental
illness continues to grow, it is clear that online commu-
nities will serve as valuable outlets for these individuals.
Future
research
must
establish
whether
online
peer-to-peer support effectively challenges stigma and
helps overcome social isolation among individuals
with serious mental illness.
Increase consumer activation
Engaging with similar others online may prompt fur-
ther interest in learning what to expect, how to cope
and how to approach important health care decisions.
As individuals with serious mental illness increasingly
use popular social media to share experiences navigat-
ing the health care system, discuss the use of different
medications and communicate about the importance
of finding the right doctor (Naslund et al. 2014);

 activation and mental health care seeking behaviours.
A recent study found that many people with mental
illness were motivated to seek formal mental health
care after first searching or discussing concerns with
peers online (Lawlor & Kirakowski, 2014). It is possible
that connecting with similar others through online net-
works may act as a catalyst for prompting individuals
to seek formal care (Powell et al. 2003).
Learning about the experiences of others may help
individuals feel at ease, know what questions to ask
and know what to expect during a medical visit or
hospitalisation (Lowe et al. 2009). Prior studies have
shown that when someone learns about other people’s
personal experiences facing illness, they feel more con-
fident and empowered in making their own health
care decisions (Entwistle et al. 2011). Research also sug-
gests that many people will seek health information
online following a medical visit where they felt dissat-
isfied or disagreed with the advice they received from
their medical provider (Raupach & Hiller, 2002).
Among people with serious mental illness who have
access to medical care, research consistently shows that
it is substandard (Wang et al. 2002). Peer-facilitated
approaches to finding ways to better communicate
with medical providers, to navigate unfamiliar health
care environments and to take an active role during
primary care visits may be important strategies for
improving the quality of health care encounters
(Bartels et al. 2013). Therefore, learning from peers
through online networks may help individuals with
serious mental illness realise that they can make their
own health care decisions, and may help them become
more empowered consumers by being better prepared
for medical visits and being more proactive and assert-
ive in their communication with health care providers.
Further research is needed to determine whether seek-
ing health information and learning tips and strategies
from peers online can help individuals with serious
mental illness feel more confident in their interactions
with medical and mental health care providers.
Access to interventions for mental and physical
wellbeing
As people with serious mental illness feel comfortable vis-
iting online networks, there may be opportunities for
these individuals to access interventions aimed at sup-
porting mental and physical wellbeing. Interventions
delivered through online communities could leverage
mutual support among peers, and help promote treat-
ment
engagement
and
prevent
study
attrition
(Alvarez-Jimenez et al. 2014), and reach a wider demo-
graphic including individuals who may be reluctant to
seek formal services (Naslund et al. 2015b). There may
be opportunities to deliver flexible interventions that
allow personalisation by catering to the different needs
and preferences of members of the online community
(Alvarez-Jimenez et al. 2014). Interventions could be
adaptive, by integrating feedback from peers within the
network and making improvements to intervention
design and delivery in real time. For instance, an inter-
vention could iteratively incorporate new strategies or
content suggested by community members based on
the number of likes or positive feedback from others.
To date, the majority of studies of online networks
among
people
with
serious
mental
illness
have
involved survey methods, qualitative interviews, or
content analyses of online discussions (Lawlor &
Kirakowski, 2014). Few studies have collected object-
ive mental or physical health outcomes over time,
and only a handful of interventions have been deliv-
ered to individuals with serious mental illness using
social media (Alvarez-Jimenez et al. 2014; Naslund
et al. 2015c). For example, the HORYZONS social net-
working
intervention
for
first
episode
psychosis
involves the delivery of evidence-based online psy-
choeducation enhanced by moderated peer-to-peer
support within an online forum (Alvarez-Jimenez
et al. 2013, Lederman et al. 2014). Preliminary findings
show that young participants were highly engaged in
the HORYZONS system, and found it safe to use
and empowering, and reported that it helped them
feel more socially connected (Alvarez-Jimenez et al.
2013). Recent studies of online psychoeducation inter-
ventions for bipolar disorder have also included mod-
erated discussion forums to facilitate peer-to-peer
support (Simon et al. 2011; Smith et al. 2011; Todd
et al. 2014; Lauder et al. 2015).
While these studies have been highly promising,
there have also been mixed results. A randomised con-
trolled trial of online peer support yielded inconclusive
results regarding the benefits of online interactions
among
individuals
with
serious
mental
illness
(Kaplan et al. 2011). However, these interventions
have all been delivered through online environments
developed specifically for the research studies. Using
artificially created online networks may not be general-
isable because these networks may lack the norms,
dynamics and atmosphere of naturally occurring online
communities (Lawlor & Kirakowski, 2014). Therefore,
future studies should attempt to use naturally occur-
ring peer-to-peer networks as observed on popular
social media. It will be important to consider how for-
mal interventions may alter peer dynamics within
naturally occurring networks, and whether providing
evidence-based services in this way might affect how
individuals choose to interact with each other online.
Given the high prevalence of co-occurring mental
and physical health concerns among people with ser-
ious mental illness (Sokal et al. 2004), interventions

 delivered through social media should be aimed at
promoting
both
mental
and
physical
wellbeing.
Efforts could support individual empowerment, social
connection, skill building, psychoeducation and men-
tal illness recovery, while simultaneously promoting
healthy lifestyle such as quitting smoking, eating
healthy, establishing a regular sleep schedule and get-
ting exercise. Efforts in the general population include
interventions on Facebook for weight loss (Napolitano
et al. 2013) and smoking cessation (Ramo et al. 2015)
among young adults, while emerging wearable tech-
nologies could afford opportunities for peers with ser-
ious mental illness to share exercise or personal
wellness goals over social media (Naslund et al.
2015a). Delivering interventions for mental and physic-
al wellbeing through social media appears highly
promising, yet the success of future interventions will
depend on whether skills learned in online networks
can be applied to real world contexts (Alvarez-Jimenez
et al. 2014).
Risks of online peer-to-peer support
Online peer-to-peer connections are influencing the
way people with serious mental illness experience
their symptoms, find ways to cope and seek mental
health care; yet, risks and concerns surrounding this
emerging form of online communication must be care-
fully considered. For instance, there are risks inherent
in obtaining advice from peers with unknown creden-
tials. It is not always possible to confirm the reliability
of what peers say to each other in an online network,
and it is not clear how different content is perceived
as trustworthy (Entwistle et al. 2011). It is also possible
that learning from the experiences of others online may
lead to unrealistic expectations and greater anxiety or
confusion about one’s own condition (Ziebland &
Wyke, 2012). However, research shows that many peo-
ple who visit online networks are aware of the need to
evaluate the suggestions and advice provided by
others with caution, and also to assess whether the
information posted by others is applicable to their
own health concerns (Armstrong & Powell, 2009,
Schrank et al. 2010).
Social media also provides opportunities to form
meaningful relationships with others, which can be
beneficial, but also poses risks. Prior studies have
shown that individuals can develop a dependency
for online relationships (Caplan, 2003; Chung, 2013),
resulting in further challenges communicating in off-
line environments (Crabtree et al. 2010). Online net-
works
may
also
contribute
to
greater
social
withdrawal and avoidance (Lawlor & Kirakowski,
2014). However, many individuals with serious mental
illness may already be highly socially isolated before
seeking connections with others online, suggesting
that online networks may at least provide some form
of interaction or group belonging. It is also possible
that online peer networks may be the only potential
way to reach the most socially isolated individuals.
Online interactions with peers can generally have a
positive influence, though it is possible to discover
online forums that support or promote self-harm and
other unhealthy or destructive behaviours (Ziebland
& Wyke, 2012). Additional risks may include exposure
to hostile or derogatory comments posted by others, as
well as online harassment. A recent review of online
social networking among people with mental illness
found
limited
evidence
of
such
risks
(Highton-
Williamson et al. 2015), though research must explore
whether individuals with serious mental illness are
able to retain a sense of control over negative social
encounters online, or whether negative encounters
further exacerbate their mental health symptoms or
contribute to reduced self-esteem. These risks are not
unique to online environments, and it is important to
acknowledge that individuals with serious mental ill-
ness remain at elevated risk of being victims of dis-
crimination, abuse and violent crimes in face-to-face
encounters in real world settings (Goodman et al.
1997, Lam & Rosenheck, 1998; Hiday et al. 1999;
Corrigan et al. 2003). Therefore, the risks of connecting
with similar others through social media should
always be considered in light of existing susceptibility
to risks posed by offline encounters. Overall, benefits
of online peer-to-peer support appear to outweigh
potential concerns, though sources of risk must be
explored further to inform future research efforts.
Challenges ahead and next steps
When people with serious mental illness connect with
online communities of similar others to learn, share
and give and receive support, it challenges dominant
societal views that this alienated group lacks the tech-
nical proficiency and ability to engage in meaningful
social relationships through contemporary techno-
logical platforms (Parr, 2008). Online peer networks
challenge pervasive societal stigma and discrimination
by giving diverse patient groups their own voice and
opportunity for self-expression. As the use of popular
social media continues to proliferate rapidly (Duggan,
2015),
peer-to-peer
interactions
will
increasingly
become an important part of how people with serious
mental illness communicate with each other.
Future research must carefully consider the mechan-
isms involved in online peer-to-peer connections that
may be fundamental in supporting and promoting

access to mobile devices (Smith, 2015) across all demo-
graphic groups, focused efforts will be necessary to
reach the most isolated and low-income individuals
with serious mental illness who may have greater
symptom severity, lower education and who may
remain disconnected or unable to access online net-
works. Mobile devices have become the primary
method for accessing social media (Kemp, 2015),
which facilitates access among low-income individuals
who rely on their mobile devices for Internet access
(McGrane, 2013).
Increasing mobile connectivity and use of social
media are occurring even more rapidly throughout
the developing world (Pew Research Center, 2014). As
popular social media becomes an integral form of com-
munication and social connection across low-income
regions, there is similar potential to leverage the bottom-
up and user-driven nature of these online peer networks
to support mental health recovery, empowerment and
to combat stigma. This may be especially important in
fragmented health care systems in low and middle
income countries where access to mental health services
is limited and even non-existent (Patel et al. 2007). It is
possible that the greatest gains in peer-to-peer connec-
tions among people with serious mental illness will be
realised across low-resource settings.
We are at the beginning of what will likely be a
significant shift in the way that people with serious
mental illness can challenge stigma, seek health infor-
mation and access interventions aimed at providing
support and promoting mental and physical well-
being. As this research area advances, it is essential
to closely involve individuals with serious mental ill-
ness who are active members of online communities
to inform efforts aimed at harnessing the use of online
peer networks. There are also methodological chal-
lenges to surmount, such as determining the ideal
approaches for evaluating multicomponent interven-
tions delivered through online peer networks, and
identifying strategies for collecting objective mental
and physical health outcome measures to determine
effectiveness and impact. As Parr (2008) points out,
people with serious mental illness may experience
greater social connectedness, feelings of group belong-
ing and instrumental and emotional support from
online peer-to-peer support, however these indivi-
duals still live in an offline world. Therefore, the true
challenge that lies ahead will be to determine whether
benefits of feeling less alone, learning from similar
others and gaining confidence from interacting with
peers online translate into tangible and meaningful
improvements in recovery, employment, or mental
and physical wellbeing that will be realised in the off-
line world.
