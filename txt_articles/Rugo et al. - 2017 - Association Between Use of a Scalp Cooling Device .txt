Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Chemotherapy-induced alopecia is a common and distressing adverse effect. In 
previous studies of scalp cooling to prevent chemotherapy-induced alopecia, conclusions have 
been limited.
OBJECTIVES—To evaluate whether use of a scalp cooling system is associated with a lower 
amount of hair loss among women receiving specific chemotherapy regimens for early-stage 
breast cancer and to assess related changes in quality of life.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—A prospective cohort study conducted at 5 US 
medical centers of women with stage I or II breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy regimens excluding sequential or combination anthracycline and taxane (106 
patients in the scalp cooling group and 16 in the control group; 14 matched by both age and 
chemotherapy regimen). The study was conducted between August 2013 and October 2014 with 
ongoing annual follow-up for 5 years.
EXPOSURES—Use of a scalp cooling system. Scalp cooling was initiated 30 minutes prior to 
each chemotherapy cycle, with scalp temperature maintained at 3°C (37°F) throughout 
chemotherapy and for 90 minutes to 120 minutes afterward.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Self-estimated hair loss using the Dean scale was 
assessed 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy by unblinded patient review of 5 
photographs. A Dean scale score of 0 to 2 (≤50% hair loss) was defined as treatment success. A 
positive association between scalp cooling and reduced risk of hair loss would be demonstrated if 
50% or more of patients in the scalp cooling group achieved treatment success, with the lower 
bound of the 95% CI greater than 40% of the success proportion. Quality of life was assessed at 
baseline, at the start of the last chemotherapy cycle, and 1 month later. Median follow-up was 29.5 
months.
RESULTS—Among the 122 patients in the study, the mean age was 53 years (range, 28–77 
years); 77.0% were white, 9.0% were black, and 10.7% were Asian; and the mean duration of 
chemotherapy was 2.3 months (median, 2.1 months). No participants in the scalp cooling group 
received anthracyclines. Hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0–2) was seen in 67 of 101 
patients (66.3%; 95% CI, 56.2%–75.4%) evaluable for alopecia in the scalp cooling group vs 0 of 
16 patients (0%) in the control group (P < .001). Three of 5 quality-of-life measures were 
significantly better 1 month after the end of chemotherapy in the scalp cooling group. Of patients 
who underwent scalp cooling, 27.3% (95% CI, 18.0%–36.6%) reported feeling less physically

 attractive compared with 56.3% (95% CI, 31.9%–80.6%) of patients in the control group (P = .02). 
Of the 106 patients in the scalp cooling group, 4 (3.8%) experienced the adverse event of mild 
headache and 3 (2.8%) discontinued scalp cooling due to feeling cold.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among women undergoing non–anthracycline-based 
adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer, the use of scalp cooling vs no scalp cooling 
was associated with less hair loss at 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy. Further research 
is needed to assess outcomes after patients receive anthracycline regimens, longer-term measures 
of alopecia, and adverse effects.
Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women worldwide,1 and treatment 
often includes adjuvant chemotherapy. Improvements in supportive care have reduced toxic 
effects; however, chemotherapy-induced alopecia remains almost universal and is rated by 
patients with breast cancer as one of the most distressing treatment-related adverse 
effects.2,3
Scalp cooling has been used in more than 30 countries as a potential mechanism to prevent 
chemotherapy-induced alopecia.4 One review of more than 6000 patients suggested that 
scalp cooling was effective, but not for all patients.5 Efficacy results vary significantly and 
studies include heterogeneous chemotherapy regimens, patients with multiple types of 
cancer, nonvalidated outcome measures (such as use of wigs), and subjective hair loss 
assessment.4
Possible mechanisms for efficacy of scalp cooling include vasoconstriction with reduced 
delivery of chemotherapy to the scalp, reduced cellular drug uptake, and decreased follicular 
metabolic rate.6–8 Cooling techniques include frozen caps replaced every 30 minutes and 
scalp cooling systems that circulate coolant into a cap. Scalp cooling systems have several 
advantages over cooling caps, including the lack of needing to freeze caps and coordinate 
cap changes.9
Although scalp cooling has been available for several decades in Europe, use has been 
limited in the United States due to insufficient prospective efficacy data with current 
chemotherapy regimens, lack of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance, 
underestimation of the psychological effect of hair loss, and concerns about the theoretical 
risk of scalp metastases. Recent studies showed no association between scalp cooling and 
scalp metastases or decreased survival among patients with breast cancer,10–13 reducing 
these concerns.
This prospective cohort study was designed to explore the association between scalp cooling 
and hair loss among women receiving adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, excluding 
combination chemotherapy with anthracyclines.
Methods
Study Design and Oversight
This multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted at 5 medical centers (6 sites) to 
evaluate scalp hypothermia using a scalp cooling device (DigniCap, Dignitana AB) under an 
Rugo et al.

 investigational device exemption from the FDA. A concurrent age- and chemotherapy 
treatment–matched control group was included to demonstrate that the included 
chemotherapy regimens cause severe hair loss. The study protocol (appears in Supplement 
1) and consent process were approved by the institutional review board at each center. All 
patients signed written informed consent. To encourage return visits, patients at some sites 
were offered gift cards (valued between $40 and $50) at the 4-week visit and at each annual 
follow-up visit.
Patients
Eligibility criteria included (1) females aged 18 years or older with stage I or II breast 
cancer, (2) planned neoadjuvant cytotoxic therapy including an anthracycline or taxane 
(anthracyline and taxane could not be used together or in sequence), (3) liver function test 
results of less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, (4) a Karnofsky performance status 
of 80% or greater (normal activity with effort; some sign or symptoms of disease), and (5) a 
planned chemotherapy regimen to be completed within 6 months. Patients with female-
pattern baldness resembling picture I-3 or higher on the Savin (or Ludvig) scale at baseline 
were excluded.14 Information on race/ethnicity was collected because fitting of the cap may 
differ according to hair texture and head shape. Race/ethnicity was self-reported by patients 
using fixed categories.
Eligible chemotherapy regimens included docetaxel and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide, docetaxel and carboplatin (with human epidermal growth factor receptor 
2 [HER2/ERBB2]–targeted therapy), weekly paclitaxel, dose-dense paclitaxel, paclitaxel 
and carboplatin, and docetaxel with HER2/ERBB2–targeted therapy (eBox in Supplement 
2). Dose reductions or delays were allowed for adverse toxic effects per standard guidelines. 
Patients electing not to undergo scalp cooling were enrolled in the concurrent control group.
Patients in the control group were matched retrospectively to a patient at the same 
investigative site by age (within 5 years) and chemotherapy regimen. Because complete hair 
loss occurs in more than 65% of patients receiving the chemotherapy regimens allowed in 
this study,15 the number of control patients required was minimized after discussion with the 
FDA (representatives from the FDA, oral communication, February 11, 2013). Thirty control 
patients were planned; however, if at least 12 of 15 (80%) lost at least 50% of their hair by 
the time of the preplanned interim analysis, which was assessed by an independent data and 
safety monitoring board using photographs, enrollment to the control group would be 
stopped.
Scalp Cooling Procedure
Scalp cooling was initiated 30 minutes prior to each chemotherapy cycle by fitting the 
silicone cap on the patient’s head, followed by application of an insulating neoprene cap. 
The silicone cap was then gradually cooled to the target treatment temperature by liquid 
coolant (monopropylene glycol) circulating through channels within 2 cooling 
compartments (front and back). Hoses connect the silicone cap to the computerized cooling 
and control unit to maintain a constant controlled scalp temperature during the treatment 
period. Scalp temperature was monitored by 2 separate sensors at the front and back of the

 cap. An additional sensor ensures that the temperature never decreases below freezing. 
Deviations from the default temperature were automatically adjusted. Scalp temperature was 
to be maintained at 3°C (37°F) throughout chemotherapy and for 90 minutes to 120 minutes 
afterward, resulting in a scalp temperature of approximately 15°C.16
Study End Point
The primary end point was prevention of hair loss 4 weeks after the completion of all cycles 
of chemotherapy. Treatment success was defined as a patient self-assessed maximum Dean 
score of 2 or less (hair loss of ≤50%; eTable 1 in Supplement 2),12 correlating with grade 1 
alopecia as defined using version 4.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events.
Assessment of Estimated Hair Loss
To assess hair status, photographs of patients’ hair in the treatment group and in the control 
group were taken by study personnel before the start of each chemotherapy cycle and at 3 to 
6 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle. Patients receiving weekly paclitaxel had 
photographs taken at weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12, and 3 to 6 weeks after the last dose. 
Photographs captured hair from the front (bangs held back), back, both sides, and the top 
with hair divided in the midline with hands. Patients assessed and estimated the percentage 
of hair loss using the Dean scale (score range: 0, 0% hair loss to 4, hair loss >75%) without 
blinding and in real time by comparing baseline photographs with the photographs taken 
during the current chemotherapy cycle and displayed side by side on a tablet device. 
Preplanned analyses of 4-week follow-up photographs were scored by an independent panel 
consisting of 3 raters to further validate patient assessment results. The independent panel 
also used the Dean scale and standardized photographs for the assessments and were blinded 
to treatment group.
Secondary End Points
Secondary objectives included patient-reported toxic effects and tolerability. Toxic effects 
were determined by patient-reported adverse events and by scalp examination. Annual 
follow-up is ongoing and will last for 5 years to determine any incidence of scalp 
metastases.
Tolerability was defined as the percentage of patients who completed all planned cycles of 
chemotherapy while using the scalp cooling system. Feelings of chilliness, headaches, and 
scalp pain were recorded using the Patient Symptom Survey (eFigure in Supplement 2) 
along with any use of head coverings. Satisfaction with the scalp cooling system was 
recorded 1 month after completion of chemotherapy. In addition, cap device malfunction 
(such as sensor or cooling cable issues, cooling fluid leakage) were captured.
Quality of life was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer Breast Cancer-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire administered at baseline, at 
the time of the last chemotherapy cycle, and 1 month after completion of chemotherapy.17 
Four response categories were collapsed to (1) not at all or a little bit and (2) quite a bit or 
very much. Quality of life was compared in a prespecified analysis for (1) patients who

 underwent scalp cooling vs those who did not and (2) patients with hair loss of 50% or less 
(Dean score of 0–2) vs those with hair loss greater than 50% (Dean score of 3–4) 1 month 
after completing chemotherapy.
The assessment of the association of hair loss with breast cancer treatment decisions at 6 
months after completion of chemotherapy is ongoing.
Statistical Considerations
According to the predetermined statistical analysis plan, a positive association between scalp 
cooling and reduced risk of hair loss would be demonstrated if the following criteria were 
met: (1) the proportion was 50% or greater for patients enrolled in the scalp cooling group 
having hair loss of less than 50% (Dean score of 0–2); (2) the lower bound of the 95% CI of 
the success proportion was greater than 40%; and (3) the statistical superiority of the scalp 
cooling group over the control group was confirmed by the Fisher exact test at a significance 
level of .05.
A sample size of 110 patients was planned for the scalp cooling group with an expected 
dropout rate of 10% to achieve 100 patients for the primary analysis and 15 to 30 control 
patients. Using the Fisher exact test to compare the groups with a type I error rate of 5% (2-
sided test), there was 90% power to detect the between-group proportion differences of 20% 
or less when the sample size was 15 for the control group and 66% or greater when the 
sample size was 100 for the scalp cooling group. To ensure relative balance across sites, a 
minimum of 15 patients per site were enrolled; however, the analysis was not stratified by 
study center.
To analyze the primary end point, results were recorded as treatment failures (>50% hair 
loss) for patients with missing end point assessment (ie, without Dean scores) or study 
dropouts for any reason other than chemotherapy adverse effects. The results from patients 
who dropped out due to chemotherapy adverse effects without assessment were not imputed. 
Descriptive statistics using sample size, mean, standard deviation, median, and range were 
used for continuous variables and count and percentage were used for categorical variables. 
Between-group comparisons of the Dean score for hair loss was analyzed using the Fisher 
exact test. The 95% CI of the success proportion for patients using the scalp cooling system 
was estimated using an exact method based on binomial distribution. For the quality-of-life 
analyses, the 95% CI of the proportion responding “quite a bit or very much” for each 
question was generated using an asymptotic approach.
For patients in the scalp cooling group, data are reported only for those answering quality-
of-life questions 1 month after the end of chemotherapy. The last observation carried 
forward was used for missing quality-of-life data for the control group. The P value for the 
comparison between success and failure was determined using a 2-sided χ2 test and a 
significance level of .05.
In addition to the patients included in the primary analysis, a sensitivity analysis was 
performed to examine 2 different scenarios for the maximum Dean score. The first scenario 
of the safety population was an efficacy analysis in which all patients who dropped out of

 the study for any reason were considered treatment failures. The second scenario was a per-
protocol analysis in which only patients who completed the full series of measurements and 
adhered to the protocol were included. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 
version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Patients and Chemotherapy
There were 122 patients enrolled in the study (106 in the scalp cooling group and 16 in the 
control group; Figure 1) and included in the tolerability assessment. The study was 
conducted between August 2013 and October 2014 with ongoing annual follow-up for 5 
years. A total of 117 patients were included in the primary analysis (101 in the scalp cooling 
group and 16 in the control group) and completed their prescribed chemotherapy regimen or 
dropped out for any reason other than chemotherapy adverse effects.
The mean age of treated patients was 53 years (range, 28–77 years); 77.0% were white, 
9.0% were black, and 10.7% were Asian. The demographic profile of the patients in the 
scalp cooling group and the control group was closely matched (Table 1). Baseline medical 
characteristics for medical history, physical examination, vital signs, clinical laboratory 
results, prior cancer therapy, scalp surgery, and concomitant medications were similar 
between groups.
The most common chemotherapy regimen was docetaxel and cyclophosphamide for 4 to 6 
cycles (75%; 76 of 89 for 4 cycles); other regimens included docetaxel and carboplatin 
(12.8%), weekly paclitaxel (11.9%), and docetaxel (1%) (Table 2). The last 3 chemotherapy 
regimens were given with HER2/ERBB2–targeted therapy. The mean duration of 
chemotherapy was 2.3 months (median, 2.1 months).
Scalp Cooling and Hair Loss
Of the 101 patients in the scalp cooling group included in the primary analysis, 67 (66.3%; 
95% CI, 56.2%–75.4%) demonstrated hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0–2) 
compared with 0 of 16 (0%) in the control group (P < .001; Table 3). Not all patients had 
completed the 1-month evaluation before the post hoc analysis was performed by the 
independent panel. The independent panel analysis reported hair loss of 50% or less (Dean 
score of 0–2) in 74 of the 88 patients (84.1%) who were evaluated (eTable 2 in Supplement 
2).
Photographs of a patient with a Dean score of 1 appear in Figure 2A and of a patient with a 
Dean score of 4 appear in Figure 2B. Two patients in the scalp cooling group discontinued 
treatment after 1 chemotherapy cycle (1 discontinued for nonadherence and 1 refused further 
scalp cooling). For these 2 patients, a Dean score of 4 was recorded. The sensitivity analysis 
performed on the control safety population showed similar results for the self-reported 
maximum Dean score compared with the patients included in the primary analysis with 
alopecia self-report at 1 month after the last cycle of chemotherapy (eTable 3 in Supplement 
2).

 Patients who had a self-reported alopecia Dean score of 0 to 2 were analyzed by 
chemotherapy regimen: (1) docetaxel and carboplatin (10 of 12 patients in the scalp cooling 
group [83.3%; 95% CI, 51.6%–97.9%] vs 0 of 3 in the control group; P = .02), (2) docetaxel 
and cyclophosphamide (46 of 76 patients in the scalp cooling group [60.5%; 95% CI, 
48.6%–71.6%] vs 0 of 10 in the control group; P < .001), (3) paclitaxel (10 of 12 patients in 
the scalp cooling group [83.3%; 95% CI, 51.6%–97.9%] vs 0 of 2 in the control group; P = .
07), and (4) docetaxel with monoclonal antibodies (1 patient in the scalp cooling group vs 0 
of 0 in the control group; eTable 4 in Supplement 2). One patient in the control group 
received doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and was not included in the analysis.
The proportion of patients with hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0–2) did not differ 
when analyzed by hair thickness and quality (self-assessed by the patient), history of 
previous chemotherapy, median age, median body mass index, and use of prior hormone 
therapy (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
In the interim analysis, of 16 patients in the control group, 15 were classified as having a 
Dean score 4 and 1 had a Dean score of 3; therefore, recruitment to the control group was 
discontinued as planned.
Quality of Life
Each quality-of-life measure at study entry was comparable for patients in the scalp cooling 
group with subsequent hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0–2) and those with hair loss 
of greater than 50% (Dean score of 3 or 4; eTable 6 in Supplement 2). Among all patients, 
there were significant between-group differences 1 month after chemotherapy for 3 of 5 
quality-of-life measures (Table 4). For example, 27.3% (95% CI, 18.0%–36.6%) of patients 
in the scalp cooling group reported feeling less physically attractive compared with 56.3% 
(95% CI, 31.9%–80.6%) of patients in the control group (P = .02). The results were similar 
for patients with hair loss of 50% or less in the scalp cooling group compared with the 
control group (eTable 7 in Supplement 2).
Adverse Events
Six of the 106 patients in the safety population experienced 7 adverse events that were 
considered related to the scalp cooling system treatment, including headache (4 patients), 
pruritus (1 patient), skin pain (1 patient), and head discomfort (1 patient); none of these 
events were rated severe and 1 patient had a headache that was rated as moderate using 
version 4.0 of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. No patient has 
developed scalp metastases with a median follow-up from last chemotherapy administration 
of 29.5 months (range, 24.4–34.8 months). Patient follow-up will continue for 5 years.
Tolerability
Of 106 patients in the scalp cooling group, 88 (83%) completed all planned cycles of 
chemotherapy. Three patients (2.8%) discontinued scalp cooling because of feeling cold. 
Eleven patients (10%) did not complete all chemotherapy cycles due to hair loss (n = 7) or 
chemotherapy adverse effects (n = 4).

 In the Patient Symptom Survey (on a scale of 0 to 100 with a score of 100 indicating the 
worst), a feeling of chilliness was reported by 104 of 106 (98%) with a mean score of 49.0 
(range, 7.5–97.5; n = 102) during the cooling down period and a mean score of 49.5 (range, 
2.5–92.5; n = 104) during overall cooling. Forty-three of 106 patients (41%) reported having 
headaches (mean, 1 cycle of headaches; range, 0–10 cycles of headaches) triggered or 
exacerbated by the scalp cooling treatment and reported a mean pain level of 39.3 (range, 
10–95).
Scalp pain associated with the scalp cooling treatment was reported by 75 of 106 patients 
(71%) with a mean pain level of 24.2 (range, 1.7–85.0). Patients reported use of a pain 
medication in 101 of 517 chemotherapy cycles. Of 86 patients, head coverings were used at 
least some of the time in 47 (55%) and never in 39 (45%) (eTable 8 in Supplement 2). 
Patients had a mean satisfaction score of 90.3 (range, 10–100 with a score of 100 indicating 
complete satisfaction) regarding their decision to use scalp cooling.
A device incident was reported during 22 of 519 scalp cooling chemotherapy sessions in 21 
patients. The majority of incidents were related to cap or sensor malfunction, which were 
resolved by replacing the cap. There were no cases of scalp cooling treatment failure due to 
a device incident.
Discussion
Among women undergoing non–anthracycline-based chemotherapy for stage I or II breast 
cancer, the use of a scalp cooling system during chemotherapy cycles was associated with 
less hair loss after 4 weeks of completing all planned cycles of chemotherapy. All patients in 
the control group experienced severe hair loss. Three of 5 quality-of-life measures were 
significantly better for women who underwent scalp cooling while receiving chemotherapy.
The scalp cooling system was well tolerated and 83% of patients completed all planned 
cycles of chemotherapy. The majority of the device incidents were related to cap 
malfunction, but none resulted in scalp cooling treatment failure. Estimated hair loss was not 
related to patient-assessed characteristics, including hair quality or thickness.
Multiple studies have documented the importance of hair loss to patients, and the effect of 
chemotherapy-induced alopecia on quality of life. In this study, patients in the scalp cooling 
group felt less upset about losing their hair compared with patients in the control group and 
were less dissatisfied with their body. Among those in the scalp cooling group, patients who 
had less hair loss were less upset about the overall loss of their hair, experienced less of a 
negative effect from their disease or treatment regarding feelings of physically attractiveness, 
and experienced less of a negative effect regarding feelings of femininity compared with 
those who experienced more hair loss in the control group. These data suggest that when 
scalp cooling is successful at decreasing hair loss, it could improve the treatment experience 
for women undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.
In the present study, no patients have developed scalp metastases during a median follow-up 
of more than 2 years; however, long-term follow-up is ongoing. A review of all published 
studies found no evidence of increased scalp metastases in patients who received scalp

 cooling,12 and a recent retrospective cohort study demonstrated no association of scalp 
cooling with survival in patients with early-stage breast cancer receiving adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.13 Based on these and other data, the risk of scalp metastases 
after receipt of scalp cooling treatment appears to be very small.10–13
The efficacy of scalp cooling has been reported to depend on the type of chemotherapy 
regimen, dose and schedule, infusion duration, patient performance status, drug metabolism, 
concomitant comorbidities, scalp cooling temperature, postinfusion cooling time, and the 
type of scalp cooling system.18,19 The optimal duration of postinfusion cooling time is not 
clear, with one study suggesting similar efficacy with shorter durations.20 Our study 
included commonly used regimens for stage I or II breast cancer in the United States21 and 
excluded patients receiving sequential or concordant anthracycline and taxane regimens, but 
we plan to study more intensive regimens in subsequent studies. A postcooling duration of 
90 minutes to 120 minutes was used.
Previous studies have evaluated patients with various non-validated methods and few 
matched controls, or obtained data retrospectively.8,9,22–26 One larger trial (N = 238 
patients) allocated patients with a variety of malignancies and who were receiving a range of 
doses and cycles of docetaxel to 2 different cooling systems (Paxman system or Penguin 
cold caps) or to no cooling; efficacy was determined by physician assessment or wig use.27 
A Dutch registry prospectively evaluated scalp cooling by use of a head covering in 1411 
patients, and reported high success rates in most patients except for those receiving the most 
intense anthracycline- and taxane-based regimens.28
This study differs from the majority of reports in several ways. It was a multicenter study of 
a self-contained scalp cooling system that did not rely on freezing or changing caps during 
treatment and used standardized photographs to grade hair loss. The study enrolled patients 
with early-stage breast cancer treated only with specific chemotherapy regimens to 
standardize the analysis of the results. The primary end point was based on patient self-
assessment, a relevant method for determining relative usefulness or worth of the device to 
patients themselves.3,29–32 Age- and chemotherapy treatment–matched controls were 
enrolled to demonstrate that the chemotherapy regimens in this study caused severe hair 
loss.
There are a number of limitations to this study. First is the use of a cohort study design 
without randomization, and a relatively small sample size. Given that the chemotherapy 
regimens used in this study are known to cause marked alopecia, it was determined that a 
relatively small, single-group study, with a limited number of matched controls and a 
carefully assessed end point would be likely to provide adequate data. In this study, all 
patients in the control group were graded as treatment failures (>50% hair loss). Second, 
patients included in this study did not receive anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens. 
Scalp cooling has been studied in a randomized clinical trial that included patients with 
breast cancer receiving combination anthracycline and taxane regimens.33 Third, the choice 
of a patient-assessed end point rather than by independent raters masked to treatment group 
is another limitation; however, this end point was carefully considered. Compared with a 
blinded panel, patient scores were generally lower in a 20-patient pilot study using the same

 scalp cooling system34 as used in the current study. Because hair preservation by scalp 
cooling is only important if assessed as successful by patients, the FDA requested the use of 
patient assessment based on 5 photographs compared with baseline as the primary end point 
(representatives from the FDA, oral communication, February 13, 2013). The similarity in 
success rates found by the preplanned assessment by an independent panel further supports 
this approach. However, the necessary lack of patient blinding for the primary outcome of 
hair loss remains a limitation. Fourth, the follow-up for risk of scalp metastases is short at 
2.5 years; however, follow-up is ongoing.
Conclusions
Among women undergoing non–anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy for early-stage 
breast cancer, the use of scalp cooling vs no scalp cooling was associated with less hair loss 
at 4 weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy. Further research is needed to assess 
outcomes after patients receive anthracycline regimens, longer-term measures of alopecia, 
and adverse effects.

 Key Points
Question
Is scalp cooling associated with a lower risk of hair loss when used by women receiving 
common adjuvant chemotherapy regimens for early-stage breast cancer?
Findings
In this multicenter study, hair loss of 50% or less (Dean score of 0–2) was seen in 66.3% 
of patients in the scalp cooling group vs 0% of patients in the control group at 4 weeks 
after completing non–anthracycline-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Three of 5 quality-of-
life measurements, including feeling less physically attractive, showed benefit for women 
who received scalp cooling.
Meaning
This self-contained cooling system was associated with a lower risk of hair loss among 
women receiving non–anthracycline-based chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer.

 Figure 1. Flowchart of Patients in Scalp Cooling Trial
The primary analysis estimate of hair loss included all eligible patients who received at least 
1 cycle of chemotherapy and who did not discontinue scalp cooling due to adverse effects of 
chemotherapy or a major protocol violation (nonadherence). Patients electing not to undergo 
scalp cooling were enrolled in the concurrent control group. Patients in the control group 
were matched retrospectively to a patient at the same investigative site by age (within 5 
years) and the same chemotherapy regimen.
