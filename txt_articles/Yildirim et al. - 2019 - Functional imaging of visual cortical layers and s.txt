Two-photon microscopy is used to image neuronal activity, but has severe limitations for
studying deeper cortical layers. Here, we developed a custom three-photon microscope
optimized to image a vertical column of the cerebral cortex > 1 mm in depth in awake mice
with low (<20 mW) average laser power. Our measurements of physiological responses and
tissue-damage thresholds define pulse parameters and safety limits for damage-free three-
photon imaging. We image functional visual responses of neurons expressing GCaMP6s
across all layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and in the subplate. These recordings reveal
diverse visual selectivity in deep layers: layer 5 neurons are more broadly tuned to visual
stimuli, whereas mean orientation selectivity of layer 6 neurons is slightly sharper, compared
to neurons in other layers. Subplate neurons, located in the white matter below cortical layer
6 and characterized here for the first time, show low visual responsivity and broad orientation
selectivity.

ultiphoton microscopy has been used to perform high-
resolution structural and functional brain imaging in
awake and anesthetized mice1–3. Unfortunately, two-
photon microscopy still has several limitations when it comes to
deep brain imaging, including potential in-focus cell damage and
phototoxicity due to high optical intensities as well as low signal
to background ratio4,5. Crucially, with increasing imaging depth,
the relative strengths of out-of-focus (background) fluorescence
signal relative to signal from the focal region becomes higher due
to scattering6,7. Thus, the maximum imaging depth reaches a
fundamental limit when the background signal generated close to
the surface equals the signal arising from the focal volume. This
maximum imaging depth is dependent on the tissue’s optical
properties7–9; absorption and scattering due to densely packed
neuronal and non-neuronal cells and cellular processes of the
cortex limit the imaging depth to 2–3 scattering lengths for green
fluorescent protein (GFP) or green genetically encoded calcium
indicator (GCaMP) imaging10,11. Thus, two-photon microscopy
is typically limited to imaging the superficial 300–400 µm of
cortex, which spans a depth of 1 mm or more in mice. To
overcome this limitation for imaging deep layers of the brain with
two-photon microscopy, wavefront correction was applied to
image deep layers12. Also, confined expression of fluorophore was
achieved via either using layer-specific Cre-dependent animals13,
or virus injection14.
To image all six layers of the cortex with multiphoton micro-
scopy, increasing the excitation wavelength and utilizing three-
photon microscopy is reasonable due to increased scattering
length at longer wavelengths and reduced out-of-focus back-
ground signal15. Indeed, such implementation has been shown to
improve the maximum imaging depth in brain tissues for struc-
tural imaging15,16. Recently, in vivo three-photon microscopy at
1300 nm wavelength has been used to record spontaneous activity
of hippocampal neurons with GCaMP6s calcium indicator in
anesthetized mice17. Although this study has shown proof-of-
concept of functional deep tissue imaging, assessment of different
kinds of tissue damage and functional changes in neurons is a
major concern in three-photon microscopy. Since multiple stu-
dies demonstrate that increase in temperature may result in
physiological
changes
in
the
brain
without
any
visible
damage18,19, optimization of laser and microscope parameters
through characterization of optical properties of the brain is
required to enable valid, reliable and damage-free recording of
evoked neuronal responses in deep brain regions in awake mice.
Consideration of laser parameters such as pulse width and
repetition rate, along with optical parameters such as scan lens,
tube lens, objective, and collection optics, is crucial for developing
an energy-efficient microscope for reducing or eliminating tissue
damage in physiological imaging experiments. The number of
photons absorbed per fluorophore in three-photon excitation is
inversely proportional to the square of the pulse width times the
repetition rate (see “Methods” section for detailed explanation).
Thus, reducing the pulse width and/or repetition rate auto-
matically increases the number of photons absorbed per fluor-
ophore. However, decreasing the repetition rate results in low
imaging frame rate. Furthermore, lowering the pulse width to
very short pulses may induce higher-order dispersion, which may
elongate the pulse width on the sample. Design parameters for the
microscope can be categorized into two groups, as ones related to
the excitation path and the emission path. Excitation path para-
meters consist of shaping the laser beam corresponding to the
scanning mirrors, designing the scan and tube lens to reduce
aberration in the system, and designing the objective lens to
increase transmission of the laser beam with uniform illumina-
tion. On the other hand, optimizing the emission path consists of
designing an objective lens to increase the transmission of emitted
light from the brain, and collection optics to increase the signal
acquired for different imaging modalities. Although there has
been some effort to maximize the efficiency of two-photon
fluorescence microscopy20,21, there has been no similar analysis
for three-photon microscopy. Importantly, better characterization
of the optical properties of the live brain is required to select
parameters for three-photon microscope design. The method
used in recent studies is based on labeling blood vessels with high
two-photon absorption cross-section dyes and imaging them with
two-photon microscopy at 1300 nm15,22. Alternatively, label-free
imaging of blood vessels with third harmonic generation (THG)
imaging can also provide information about scattering properties
of the brain at 1300 nm wavelength, since there are well-known
Soret transition peaks of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin at 415 and
430 nm, respectively23. Both of these methods rely on the
assumption that ballistic photons are mostly responsible for the
signal acquired in the photon multiplier tube (PMT). In order to
determine the optical properties at the excitation wavelength
more precisely, creating small laser ablation spots has been sug-
gested for turbid tissues9,24. In these studies, tissues are ablated at
different depths with different pulse energies to determine the
tissue optical properties and threshold energies for ablation in
each tissue layer.
Here we have used the above measurements and demonstrate
the development of an energy-efficient, damage-free three-photon
microscope, utilizing optical properties of the live mouse brain.
We have measured visual responses of neurons across cortical
layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) in mice. Importantly, we
have imaged responses of neurons in the deep layers of V1 and,
for the first time, in the subplate, in the white matter below
cortical layer 6, and demonstrated their unique response prop-
erties. These measurements demonstrate the feasibility of opti-
mized three-photon microscopy for live deep-tissue functional
imaging at subcellular resolution.
Results
Optimizing laser and microscope parameters. We constructed a
three-photon microscope (Fig. 1a; see “Methods” section) and
focused on optimizing laser parameters to image GFP and
GCaMP6s labeled neurons in awake mice with minimal pulse
energy. The wavelength of the noncollinear optical parametric
amplifier (NOPA) system varied between 1280–1350 nm with
10 nm intervals. The excitation wavelength was optimized at
1300 nm to maximize both GFP and GCaMP6s signals. Since the
optics inside the microscope elongated the pulse width on the
sample, a two-prism based pre-chirp system was developed to
compensate for pulse broadening so that the pulse width on the
sample was reduced to 40 fs. This short pulse width can allow us
to perform three-photon imaging of all cortical layers of a mouse
brain with remarkably low (<20 mW) average power (see
“Methods” section and below). Furthermore, a delay line (Sup-
plementary Figure. 1) was built to double the repetition rate for
obtaining a reasonable frame rate for calcium imaging (Fig. 1a).
We designed the intermediate optics in the excitation path to
maximize the efficiency of GCaMP6s and GFP excitation. Since
there are no exact specifications of individual elements of a
commercial objective (XLPN25XWMP2, Olympus) that we used
in this study, we modeled the objective in Zemax software via
iterative optimization using a published Olympus objective design
as the starting point25. The objective design (Fig. 1b) was
optimized for overall transmission, clear aperture, overall length,
effective focal length, working distance, and lateral resolution at
1300 nm with maximum acceptance angle of 2°. The point spread
function (PSF) of each acceptance angle (Fig. 1c) and calculated
spot sizes in this objective design corresponded to an effective

 numerical aperture (NA) of 1.02. This NA agreed well with the
actual NA of 1.05 with 25× magnification objective used (other
parameters of the objective are tabulated in Supplementary
Table 1). The scan and tube lens combination was modeled in
Zemax software with a single galvanometric mirror. The
collimated beam was sent to a galvanometric mirror and scanned
in the angular range of −10 to 10° (representing an effective
range of −2 to 2° at the back aperture of the objective lens).
Therefore, the 4f imaging system was designed with a scan lens
and a tube lens having focal lengths of 75 and 375 mm,
respectively. To optimize the design of these two lenses, the
designed objective was also included in the model and the
aberration in each component was minimized for the full
scanning range (Supplementary Figure. 2a). First, field curvature
and f-theta distortion were minimized to 2 µm and 0.5 percent
(Supplementary Figure. 2b), respectively. Second, spot sizes at
different scanning angles on the focal and afocal planes were
minimized (Supplementary Figure. 2c). Third, RMS wavefront
error for the entire range of incidence angle at the objective was
optimized (Supplementary Figure. 2d). For values up to 1.5°
incidence angle, root mean square (RMS) wavefront error was
better than or comparable to the diffraction limited case (dashed
line) and started to degrade for angles exceeding 1.5°. This
objective with higher transmission at 1300 nm wavelength (70%)
provided two-fold improvement compared to a similar objective
used for two-photon studies (Olympus, 25 × , 1.05 NA) which has
less transmission (30%) at 1300 nm wavelength (Supplementary
Figure. 3).
Finally, we designed the collection optics to maximize
collection efficiency, taking into account optical properties of
the live brain. The emission light path of the microscope was also
modeled in Zemax software. The brain tissue was modeled as
seawater with corresponding scattering length at each emission
wavelength. Previous studies26,27 reported the average refractive
index of cortical neurons as 1.37, which is comparable to that of
seawater (refractive index n = 1.34). By using an extinction length
of 270 µm (see below), and absorption length of 1 mm for water
at 1300 nm28, the scattering length of brain and anisotropy of

Fig. 1 Schematic of upright three-photon microscope and layout of the modeled objective lens. a Femtosecond laser pulses from the pump laser (1045 nm)
were used to pump the noncollinear optical parametric amplifier (NOPA) to obtain 1300 nm excitation wavelength. The pulse width was elongated using a
two-prism pair system and the repetition rate was doubled to 800 kHz by adding a delay line. Power control of laser pulses was performed using a
combination of a half-wave plate (HWP) and polarizing cube beam splitter (PCBS). A quarter-wave plate (QWP) was used to control the polarization state
of the laser pulses to maximize third harmonic generation (THG) signal on the mouse brain. Laser beams were scanned by a pair of galvanometric scanning
mirrors (SM), which were then imaged on the back aperture of a 1.05 NA, 25× objective lens (OL) by a pair of a scan lenses (SL) and a tube lens (TL). Mice
were placed on a two-axis motorized stage. The objective was placed on a one-axis motorized stage. Emitted light was collected by a dichroic mirror (CM1,
FF705-Di01,Semrock; CM2, Di02-R488, Semrock; CM3, FF555-Di03, Semrock), collection optics (CO), laser blocking filters (BF, FF01-670/SP), and
nonlinear imaging filters (FA, FF01-433/24-25, Semrock; FB, FF03-525/50, Semrock; FC, FF01-630/92) and corresponding collection optics (COA, COB,
and COC) for each photomultiplier tube (PMT A, PMT B, and PMT C). To make laser ablation marks at different depths of cortex, the output of the pump
laser (1045 nm) was sent to the microscope using a mechanical shutter (MS) and a long pass dichroic mirror (DM, Di02-R1064, Semrock). b The optical

 scattering (g) were calculated as 64, 75, and 90 µm and 0.94, 0.93,
and 0.92 for emission wavelengths of 433 nm (Supplementary
Figure 2g), 520 nm (Supplementary Figure. 2f), and 600 nm
(Supplementary Figure. 2e), respectively by using Mie theory.
Thus, for 106 photons generated in the focal plane at 1 mm depth
in seawater with bulk Henyey-Greenstein scattering29, the
number of collected photons in each PMT was evaluated with
collection optics.
With 2-inch
dichroic
mirrors,
a 2-inch
collection lens and 1-inch emission lens to optimize collection,
the number of collected photons in each PMT was doubled
compared to 1-inch collection optics17 (Supplementary Figure. 4).
In addition, we compared these two collection schemes in vivo
experimentally by changing the aperture size of an iris placed
after the first dichroic (CM1, Fig. 1a) from one inch to two inches
(Supplementary Figure. 5a). We found that two-inch optics
provides two-fold improvement compared to one-inch size optics
while imaging axonal tracts in the white matter via THG
microscopy (Supplementary Figures. 5b, c). Overall, optimization
of laser parameters and microscope design enabled us to develop
a highly efficient three-photon microscope so that we could
record neuronal responses through all cortical layers and the
subplate of V1.
Effective attenuation length and damage thresholds. The
effective attenuation length (EAL) comprises of both scattering
and absorption length at the corresponding excitation wave-
length. EAL of somatosensory cortex in mouse brain has been
characterized through two-photon fluorescence microscopy by
imaging the vasculature labeled by red dye15,22. This method
measured an extinction length of 285 µm at 1280 nm, by calcu-
lating the slope of signal attenuation of the two-photon signal
with respect to depth. Here, we used two alternative label-free
methods to calculate the extinction length in awake mouse brain.
The first method was based on creating small lesions at different
depths with an excitation wavelength of 1300 nm. To apply this
method in awake mouse cortex, four different depths ranging
from 150 to 600 µm in 150 µm increments were ablated. A
characteristic plot showing percent ablation versus laser energy
at brain surface (Fig. 2a) for 150 µm ablation depth shows that
25.7 nJ pulse energy on the surface was required to obtain 50%
ablation, where the targeted ablation diameter was 25 µm. To
calculate the percent of ablation damage, GCaMP6s images were
obtained before and after ablation with varying pulse energies
from 10 to 50 nJ (Fig. 2b, see Supplementary Figure. 6 for ablation
depths of 450 and 600 µm). The slope of the threshold energy
(Eth) versus ablation depth (Fig. 2c) corresponded to 270.3 ±
12.7 µm extinction length, while the y-axis intercept provided a
threshold fluence of 1.04 ± 0.07 J/cm2 (mean ± standard error of
the mean (s.e.m.), see “Methods” section). This threshold is in
good agreement with theoretical estimate of laser-induced optical
breakdown in water30 As described in the previous section, we
used this extinction length to optimize the collection optics in the
emission path of the microscope. Since only the excitation
wavelength is included in these ablation experiments and its
analysis (Fig. 2a), this method provides a more precise estimation
of the effective attenuation length of the cortex.
The second method of obtaining extinction length was based
on calculating the slope of the attenuation signal acquired with

 THG microscopy of blood vessels. Since blood has a one-photon
Soret-band transition peak at 430 nm23, THG imaging at
1300 nm was used to get a reliable signal from blood vessels. In
addition,
three-dimensional
depth-resolved
THG
image
at
1300 nm (Fig. 3a) was similar to the images of labeled blood
vessels acquired with two-photon microscopy. Therefore, we
conclude that most of the THG signal was generated from the
blood vessels. THG signal attenuation curve resulted in 242 ± 40 µm
extinction length in the cortex and 107 ± 13 µm extinction length in
the white matter, respectively (mean ± s.e.m., Fig. 2d). Thus, THG
imaging of blood vessels estimates an extinction length that is
comparable to that acquired with ablation experiments.
The threshold fluence for ablation enabled us to estimate safety
limits for laser pulse energy to avoid linear and nonlinear
absorption-related tissue damage (see “Discussion” section). For
example, the threshold energy of optical breakdown (nonlinear
absorption) was 130 nJ (~e4.9 nJ according to Fig. 2c at 600 µm
depth), which is an order of magnitude higher than the required
energy (~8 mW /800 kHz = 10 nJ) for three-photon imaging at
600 µm depth. Typical average power for imaging cortical layers
ranged from 0.5 to 10 mW. In the white matter, given the higher
scattering, typical average power for imaging ranged from 10 to
20 mW. Thus, the three-photon laser parameters necessary to
image the entire cortex are well within safety limits without
causing tissue damage.
To further reveal the safety limits for laser pulse energy to
avoid any saturation of the GCaMP6s fluorophore or any
physiological changes in the neurons, we varied the pulse energies
on the focal plane between 0.5 and 15 nJ, and measured evoked
responses of neurons across all layers of the visual cortex and in
the white matter. We found that it was safe to image with energy
pulses in the range of 0.5–5 nJ in our experimental conditions in
each layer for avoiding visible damage or saturation of the
chromophore (Supplementary Fig. 7). When the laser energy was
between 5 and 10 nJ, saturation of GCaMP6s was initiated and
the entire field of view was gradually saturated. Finally, optical
breakdown was observed when the pulse energy was >10 nJ.
Furthermore, we studied the evoked neuronal responses of each
layers while the pulse energy was <5 nJ. We classified laser pulse
energies into two subcategories as follows: (i) pulse energies
between 0.5 and 2 nJ, (ii) pulse energies between 2 and 5 nJ. We
compared both preferred orientation and average calcium signal
intensity (ΔF/F) in these two pulse energy groups (Supplementary
Fig. 8, third and fourth columns). Across all layers, approximately
70% of the visually responsive cells preserved their preferred
orientation in both of these energy groups (Supplementary

 Fig. 9a). However, the mean response intensity at the preferred
orientation was significantly reduced in the second pulse energy
group compared to the first in cells with similar preferred
orientation (Supplementary Fig. 9b). This result was consistent
across all layers. Thus, it is crucial not to exceed the 2 nJ pulse
energy threshold for evoked neuronal response studies with
three-photon microscopy, with similar laser parameters as used
by us. As a control, we also measured preferred orientation and
response intensity of layer 2/3 neurons with pulse energy of 0.5 nJ
before and after deep layer imaging. This is also one of our
motivations for optimizing our microscope-to not damage
superficial layers when imaging deep layers. We found that 95%
of these neurons preserved their preferred orientations and peak
response intensities (within 15 degrees and 10% respectively;
Supplementary Figs. 10, 11). This indicates that imaging deep
layers did not affect neurons in the superficial layers.
Application of optimized three-photon microscopy. Structural
and functional imaging of neurons in mouse cortex was carried
out in animals with appropriately labeled sets of neurons. GFP-M
mice show near-complete labeling of a subset of layer 5 (and layer
2/3) pyramidal neurons; since the basal dendrites of layer 5
pyramidal neurons spread through layer 6 while their apical
dendrites span layers 1–5, they are good candidates for demon-
strating three-photon microscopy-enabled structural imaging
through the entire cerebral cortex. A representative layer 5 pyr-
amidal neuron (Supplementary Figure. 12a) imaged in a GFP-M
mouse in vivo, typical of many imaged neurons, indeed shows the
structure of nearly the entire neuronal dendritic arbor. By fol-
lowing its somata and apical and basal dendrites, we could
reconstruct the neuron and its dendrites (Supplementary Fig-
ure. 12b). Our depth-resolved three-dimensional three-photon
images (Supplementary Fig. 12a) agreed well with similar neurons
identified in histological sections (Supplementary Fig. 12c, Sup-
plementary Table 2). In addition, we measured lateral intensity
profiles at planes 50 µm above and below the somata in layer 5
which provides upper bound for the lateral resolution of the
system. For example, we found that full-width half maximum
(FWHM) of the lateral intensity profiles is ~ 0.5 µm (Supple-
mentary Figure. 13).
For functional imaging of visual responses, the calcium
indicator GCaMP6s was virally expressed in a majority of
excitatory neurons in all layers of V1 of wild type mice (Fig. 3).
Structural imaging of the entire depth of cortex and the white
matter performed at 2 µm increments showed neurons (labeled
with
GCaMP6s)
and
blood
vessels
(with
THG
imaging)
throughout the cortex and in the white matter below cortex,
where myelinated axons were also identified with THG imaging
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Video 1). Functional imaging of neuronal
GCaMP6s responses, starting from 100 µm depth at 100 µm
increments at 4 Hz frame rate, with sinusoidal gratings drifting in
12 different directions as visual stimuli, revealed robust visual
responses in all layers. Neurons were first classified as visually
responsive, and visually responsive neurons were then classified
as orientation selective if their tuning curves were well fit to a
Gaussian function (see “Methods” section). In specific experi-
ments, laser ablation was performed at different depths in the
posterior and anterior parts of the imaging site. The animal was
euthanized and the imaging site and corresponding layers located
with
the
help
of
laser
ablation
markers
(Supplementary
Figure. 14). These marker lesions enabled identification of
cortical layers and layer-specific visual responses of neurons
from in vivo recordings (Fig. 3b), exemplified by responses of
selected cells to visual gratings and polar plots of their orientation
tuning curves (Fig. 3c).
To characterize the population neuronal responses for each
layer in a vertical column, we calculated the global (or vector-
averaged) orientation selectivity index (gOSI), local orientation
selectivity index (OSI) based on preferred stimulus responses, and
direction selectivity index (DSI) (see “Methods” section) across
five animals (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table 3). The overall global
and local OSI and DSI values in our measurements (Supplemen-
tary Table 4) resembled those in previous measurements of
neuronal responses recorded with two-photon imaging in the
superficial layers of V113,31,32. As a control, we imaged and
recorded evoked responses of the same cells in layer 2/3 with
conventional two-photon and with our three-photon microscope.
We found that preferred orientation and mean peak fluorescence
intensity obtained through two-photon and three-photon ima-
ging were matched in most of the neurons (95%) (Supplementary
Figures. 15 and 16).
Our three-photon measurements of responses in layers 5 and 6
represent the first large-scale measurements of identified deep
layer neurons in any cortical area. Layer 5 neurons had
significantly lower global and local OSI as well as DSI values
than neurons in any other layer (Supplementary Tables 5, 6 and
7). In other words, layer 5 neurons were less tuned to the visual
stimulus than other layers in the visual cortex, which was
consistent with earlier findings based on ‘blind’ electrophysiolo-
gical recordings33.
This confirmation also implied that three-photon imaging
preserved the cortex in a physiologically normal condition.
Furthermore, layer 6 neurons demonstrated significantly higher
global OSI values than those of other layers, a finding that may
relate to the demonstration that corticothalamic projection
neurons of layer 6, identified previously by intracellular labeling
and anatomical axon projections, have been described as highly
orientation selective34. Thus, this first in vivo imaging study to
characterize neuronal responses of V1 across all layers has
revealed both a broad view of layer-specific responses in the deep
layers as well as findings consistent with those estimated from
limited electrophysiological recordings.
In addition to characterizing the visual responses of V1
neurons across cortical layers, we examined for the first time
visual responses of subplate neurons in the white matter below
layer 6 (again using <20 mW average laser power). Subplate
neurons are among the earliest born neurons of the cerebral
cortex35, and are considered to be largely transient neurons
necessary for the development of cortical connections and
circuits36–38. In addition, subplate neurons have been implicated
in brain abnormalities including epilepsy39, and neurodevelop-
mental disorders including autism40,41 and schizophrenia42. The
white matter is composed of bundles of myelinated axons, and
subplate neurons are surrounded by these axons; with the help of
THG imaging of myelinated axons in the white matter, we
determined
the
location
of
GCaMP6s
expressing
subplate
neurons precisely (Fig. 5a). Their average calcium transients to
oriented drifting gratings revealed that many neurons were
robustly driven by visual stimuli, and had well-defined orienta-
tion tuning curves (Fig. 5b). However, the proportion of visually
responsive neurons in the subplate (45%) was significantly lower
than the average proportion of visually responsive neurons in
other cortical layers (80%). Population responses of subplate
neurons across five animals (Fig. 5b; Supplementary Table 3)
showed that the global and local OSI, and DSI, of these neurons
were significantly lower than these parameters in any of the V1
layers (Supplementary Tables 5–7). Thus, under our experimental

 conditions, subplate neurons in V1 are both less visually
responsive and less orientation- and direction-selective than
neurons within cortical layers. Our study also demonstrates, via
imaging that subplate neurons can survive into adulthood and at
least some proportion of them receive visual input.
Discussion
In this study, we focused on optimizing laser and microscope
parameters to carry out damage-free measurement of visual
responses of neurons in all cortical layers and subplate of the
primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice via three-photon
microscopy. We developed a pre-chirp system to compensate for
pulse broadening in the microscope and were able to reduce the
pulse width to 40 fs on the sample. Furthermore, we implemented
a delay line to increase the pulse repetition rate and improve the
frame rate. We also designed the optics in the excitation and
emission path to maximize the efficiency of the microscope. In
the excitation path, we designed a scan and tube lens integrated
with the objective lens to reduce the aberration in the microscope.
In addition, we developed two label-free methods to characterize
optical properties of the live mouse brain and we used these
properties to design the collection optics. These advances resulted
in our ability to image GCaMP6s labeled cortical layer neurons
with <10 mW and subplate neurons with <20 mW average laser
power17. Notably, this is nearly an order of magnitude less
average power than that required to image layer 5 neurons in
layer-specific Cre animals, in which only layer 5 neurons
expressed calcium indicator to improve signal-to-noise ratio, via
two-photon microscopy with wavefront shaping13. Other two-
photon studies also similarly utilized an order of magnitude
higher laser power to image either layer 514 or layer 6 neurons
with red-shifted calcium indicators43. An order of magnitude less
power usage with three-photon microscopy results from several

 parameters such as duty cycle, wavelength, and collection effi-
ciency. For example, three-photon systems have lower duty cycle
than two-photon laser systems, which helps reduce average laser
power requirement significantly. Low laser power and pulse
energy can reduce the temperature at the focal plane which
reduces the probability of bulk heating, fluorophore saturation,
and optical breakdown. In our study, we found that the prob-
ability of saturating GCaMP6s is very low (<10%) when applied
pulse energy at the focal plane is 5 nJ assuming that three-photon
cross-section of GCaMP6s is on the order of 10–82 cm6
(s/photon)2 (see “Methods” section). This estimate agrees well
with our experimental observation that the saturation of
GCaMP6s is initiated with pulse energies > 5 nJ where whole field
of view is blurred. More interestingly, we observed abnormalities
in the neuronal responses with pulse energies between 2–5 nJ
where mean response intensity at the preferred orientation is
significantly
reduced.
Thus,
we
can
conclude
that
these
abnormalities is related to the physiological changes in the neu-
rons rather than saturation of GCaMP6s calcium indicator. Low
temperature at the focal plane is always beneficial for the sake of
neuronal activity and viability of cells since multiple studies have
demonstrated that increase in temperature may result in phy-
siological changes in the brain without any visible damage18,19.
These optimizations for low-power imaging also enable three-
photon systems to perform faster and with wider field. The
current lasers available for three-photon microscope have low
repetition rate. In future, together with higher repetition rate
lasers, optimization for low-power imaging will achieve higher
speed imaging, and wider field imaging via multifocal multi-site
excitation, without tissue damage.
Understanding mechanism of brain tissue damage with fem-
tosecond pulses is crucial for performing physiological experi-
ments with three-photon microscopy. Focused ultrashort laser
pulses can create damage in the brain through either linear or
nonlinear absorption mechanisms. Linear absorption processes
depend on the average laser power and result in brain damage
through bulk heating9,44. The nonlinear process of optical
breakdown begins with the generation of free electrons through a
combination of multiphoton ionization and band-gap (Zener)
tunneling45,46. To stay within safe parameters, it is crucial to
determine the onset of these mechanisms as well as determine
which one dominates under which conditions. Our ablation
experiments provide insight into safety limits of laser pulse
energy for in vivo imaging of mouse cortex (Fig. 2c). We mea-
sured the threshold fluence of optical breakdown, Fth, as 1.04 ±
0.07 J/cm2, which corresponds to 15 nJ pulse energy at the focal
plane (Energy = Fluence x spot area, where spot area is derived
from the three-photon point spread function; see Supplementary
Figure. 17a and “Methods” section). Therefore, we can calculate
the threshold energy of optical breakdown at the surface for any
ablation depth. The threshold energy at the surface was ~130 nJ
while ablating layer 6 (600 µm depth; see Results). By comparison,
the maximum pulse energy at the surface for three-photon ima-
ging at the same depth was 10 nJ (~8 mW/ 800 kHz), corre-
sponding to 1 nJ at the focal plane (depth-resolved attenuation
due to Beer-Lambert’s law; see Methods) Thus, optical break-
down in layer 6 requires nearly an order of magnitude more pulse
energy than three-photon imaging of the same layer under our
experimental conditions.
It is important to note that increasing the repetition rate of the
laser will be able to allow us to perform higher frame rate imaging
with faster calcium indicators such as GCaMP6f. However, we
need to take into account increasing probability of bulk heating
damage with higher repetition rates. Specifically, we can plot how
pulse energy at the surface varies with different laser repetition
rates (at pulse width of 40 fs), assuming two different threshold
power values: 150 mW average laser power as a lower bound
since it is slightly higher than the recently reported maximum
average power for damage-free mouse brain imaging17,47, and
300 mW average power as an upper bound since it is the heat
damage threshold for two-photon imaging of live mouse brain at
800, 920, and 1040 nm wavelengths48 (Supplementary Figure. 19).

 This analysis shows that optical breakdown initiates laser-induced
damage for moderate laser repetition rates (<1 MHz, 150 mW
curve). Bulk heating dominates laser damage for higher repetition
rates (>2 MHz, 300 mW curve), and the pulse energy required for
imaging is always smaller than both bulk heating and optical
breakdown up to roughly 10 MHz repetition rates. In other
words, it is safe to increase the repetition rate of the laser up to
10 MHz while keeping the pulse width suitably low (<50 fs).
Elongating the pulse width would result in increasing threshold
energies for both optical breakdown and three-photon imaging.
In three-photon imaging, there is a linear relationship between
pulse energy and pulse width since the peak intensity dictates
efficiency of imaging. However, the threshold energy for optical
breakdown increases at a slow pace (~τ0.4) for pulse widths < 1
ps46. Thus, pulse widths in the range of 100–500 fs will increase
the threshold energy for imaging at a faster pace (shifting the
dashed line for imaging up in Supplementary Figure. 19), which
would result in increasing the risk of observing laser damage due
to either optical breakdown (R < 1 MHz) or bulk heating (R >
2 MHz) during three-photon imaging.
Our in vivo experiments show that neurons in different cortical
layers and in subplate of V1 have distinct visual response prop-
erties. Our first key finding is that layer 5 neurons are broadly
tuned for orientation compared to neurons in other cortical
layers. This result is consistent with previous studies based on
electrophysiological recordings from all layers of V133, two-
photon imaging of all cortical layers except layer 613, and two-
photon imaging studies focused only on subsets of layer 5 neu-
rons49,50. Broader orientation selectivity of neurons in deeper
layers, especially in layer 5, was reported also in other species:
rat51, cat52, and monkey53,54. Layer 5 neurons also have highest
spontaneous activity among neurons from all cortical layers33,
and this may contribute to their broader tuning property. Other
difference between neurons in layer 5 and other cortical layers is
the high density of subcortical projection neurons in this
layer49,50. These neurons may accumulate information from
multiple cortical layers and cell types, and thus are broadly tuned
for stimulus orientation55. Our second key finding is that layer 6
neurons have slightly sharper orientation tuning than neurons in
other layers. This is consistent with layer 6 containing substantial
numbers of corticothalamic projection neurons which have been
described as highly orientation selective34.
Using in vivo three-photon fluorescence (GCaMP6s) and label-
free (THG) imaging, our third key finding is that we image for the
first time neuronal responses in the subplate of awake mouse V1.
Subplate neurons are known to have a crucial role in the for-
mation of thalamocortical and intracortical connections35,56,57.
While most subplate neurons seem to be transient and disappear
after the cortex has formed, a small population remains, and has
been termed persistent subplate cells58. Remnant subplate neu-
rons form layer 6b and interstitial white matter neurons59–61. So
far, subplate neurons in the mature brain have not been studied at
all due to the technical challenges of imaging these cells in vivo.
An especially interesting finding is that the majority of subplate
neurons are poorly responsive visually under our experimental
conditions, and the visually driven neurons have lower global
OSI, local OSI, and DSI values than neurons in any cortical layer.
Interestingly, recent in vitro studies have shown that modulators
of arousal, such as neurotensin, strongly depolarize subplate
neurons62,63, suggesting that subplate neuron responses are
modulated by internal states. In addition, similar to neurons in
superficial layers64, layer 6b neurons may also be strongly
modulated by locomotion43. Their broad stimulus selectivity
suggests that subplate neurons may in turn influence cortical
state-dependent regulation of diverse visual cortex neurons, a
suggestion
consistent
with
a
role
for
these
neurons
in
neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric conditions. Further
studies are required to address this hypothesis.
Methods
Experimental setup. Ultrashort laser pulses (300 fs, 400 kHz,16 W) at 1045 nm
from a pump laser (Spirit, Spectra Physics) were passed through a noncollinear
optical parametric amplifier (NOPA, Spectra Physics) to obtain the excitation
wavelength of 1300 nm for GFP and GCaMP6s imaging (Fig. 1a). The internal
compressor in NOPA could compress the Gaussian pulse width to 35 fs (which was
the transform limited pulse width for 70 nm spectral full-width half-maximum
bandwidth). Due to the dispersion in the microscope, the Gaussian pulse width on
the sample was ~150 fs. In order to shorten the pulse width on the sample, a two-
prism based external compressor was built to pre-chirp the pulse before sending it
to the microscope, reducing the pulse width to 40 fs on the sample. The prisms
were made of SF10, and the distance between the two prisms were 1040 mm. After
pulse broadening, a delay line was built to double the repetition rate and increase
the frame rate for GCaMP imaging so that frame rate with 256 × 272 pixels for
250 × 250 µm2 field of view can be increased up to 8 Hz. Power control was per-
formed with the combination of half-wave plate (AHWP05M-1600, Thorlabs) and
low-GDD ultrafast beamsplitter (UFBS2080, Thorlabs) with 100:1 extinction ratio.
The laser beams were scanned by a pair of galvanometric mirrors (6215H, Cam-
bridge Technologies) to image the laser spot on the back aperture of the objective
using a pair of custom-designed scan and tube lenses. The emitted signal from the
mouse brain was collected by a pair of collection lenses for three PMTs. GCaMP6s,
GFP and retrobeads fluorescence signals were detected using GaAsP photo-
multiplier tubes (H7422A-40, Hamamatsu, Japan); THG signal was detected using
bialkali (BA) photomultiplier tube (R7600U-200). The commercially available
objective with high transmission at longer wavelength (25 × , 1.05-N.A.,
XLPN25XWMP2, Olympus) was used. Image acquisition was carried out using
ScanImage (Vidrio). Imaged cells were located at a depth of 0–1000 μm or more
below the pial surface. Laser power ranged from 0.5–16 mW at the sample
depending on depth and fluorescence expression levels. A custom stainless steel
plate (eMachineShop.com) attached to a black curtain was mounted to the head
plate before imaging to prevent light from the visual stimulus monitor from
reaching the PMTs. Awake mice and a monitor were placed on a two-axis
motorized stage (MMBP, Scientifica) and objective lens was placed on a single axis
motorized stage (MMBP, Scientifica) to move in the axial direction. Mice were
fixed on the stage with a sample holder and a head mount was placed on top of the
head to minimize motion artifacts during imaging. To determine the imaging
locations, we created laser marks at different depths in the mouse brain by directing
the pump laser to the microscope using a mechanical shutter and a long pass
dichroic mirror.
Effect of laser parameters on absorbed number of photons. Number of photons
absorbed per fluorophore in the focal volume in three-photon excitation can be

where n is the number of photons absorbed per fluorophore, P is the average laser
power, δ is the three-photon cross-section of the fluorophore, τ is the pulse width,
R is the repetition rate, NA is the numerical aperture, h is the Planck’s constant, c is

Effect of pulse energy on GCaMP6s saturation. The probability of fluorophore
excitation per laser pulse (Prpulse) should be less than 0.1 (Prpulse < 0.1) to avoid
excitation saturation and point spread function broadening. Prpulse can be calcu-
lated as follows:

Characterizing microscope performance. The performance of the three-photon
microscope was characterized by measuring the point spread function (PSF),
excitation uniformity on the sample, and emission uniformity on the PMTs.
Fluorescent beads (100 nm, Invitrogen, F8803) were suspended in agar gel and used
to measure lateral and axial resolution at imaging depths ranging from 500 to
1500 µm. The average lateral and axial full-width half-maximum (FWHM) of 20
fluorescent beads were 0.45 ± 0.05 µm and 1.9 ± 0.2 µm, respectively (mean ± s.e.m.,
two-dimensional PSF of a representative fluorescent bead is shown in Supple-
mentary Figure. 17a). In addition, we performed in-vivo PSF measurements

 specifically in the deep layers of cortex (Supplementary Figure. 18). We injected
green retrobeads (Lumafluor) in the visual cortex of one hemisphere and imaged
these retrobeads within neurons of L6 extending into L5 and the top of the white
matter (WM) in the contralateral hemisphere (which provide callosal projections).
We specifically focused on deep layers of the cortex where there is a transition
between L6 and WM, so that L5 and 6 can be accurately characterized in vivo.
Then, we imaged a column 200 µm high (from below the WM-L6 border through
L6 to L5—see Supplementary Figure. 12) at 0.2 µm increments in anesthetized
mice. The field of view was 40 µm to image individual beads at high resolution in
the lateral direction. The lateral PSF increased from 0.45 to 0.5 µm and the axial
PSF increased from 2 to 2.5 µm from L5 through L6 to WM. Thus the spherical
aberration in the system is fairly low, and degrades the lateral and axial PSF by 10
and 20%, respectively, through L5 and 6 to WM.
To check the excitation uniformity on the sample, PSF analysis was performed
for the beads located in four corners and the center of the field of view
(Supplementary Figure. 17b, left). This analysis resulted in fairly uniform PSF
distribution in the whole field of view (Supplementary Table 8). In addition, a spiky
pollen grain was imaged and translated again to the four corners and middle of the
field of view while applying the same laser power (Supplementary Figure. 17b,
right). The mean intensity and its standard deviation for these five locations are
presented in Supplementary Table 9. This analysis also showed a fairly uniform
excitation distribution in 250 µm FOV.
To check the emission uniformity on the PMTs, Rhodamine 6 G dye was
imaged as a uniform fluorescent dye. This analysis allowed us to correct any
misalignment in the collection path of the microscope and determine the effective
FOV where the PMT intensity was uniform. The PMT intensity profiles
(Supplementary Figure. 17c) show that 1D profile resulted in 250 µm effective FOV
with uniform emission from the sample.
Mice. All experiments were performed under protocols approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committee at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and con-
formed to US National Institutes of Health guidelines. In vivo experiments were
performed on adult mice between 2–6 months old. Mice of both sexes were used.
These animals were housed under 12/12-h light/dark cycle and up to four animals
per cage. The following mouse lines were used. Supplementary Figure. 12: Thy1-
GFP line M (Stock # 007788, The Jackson Laboratory)66. Figures 3, 4 and 5:
C57BL6 (wild type, WT).
Surgical procedures. Mice were initially anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane in
oxygen, and maintained on 1.5–2% isoflurane throughout the surgery. Buprenor-
phine (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous) and/or meloxicam (1 mg/kg, subcutaneous) was
administered preoperatively and every 24 h for 3 days to reduce inflammation.
Ophthalmic ointment was used to protect the animal’s eyes during the surgery.
Body temperature was maintained at 37.5 °C with a heating pad. The scalp over-
lying the dorsal skull was sanitized and removed. The periosteum was removed
with a scalpel and a craniotomy (3–4 mm) was made over the left primary visual
cortex (V1, 4.2 mm posterior, 3.5 mm lateral to Bregma), leaving the dura intact.
For calcium imaging experiments, neurons were labeled with a genetically-encoded
calcium indicator by microinjection (Stoelting) of AAV2/1.Syn.GCaMP6s.WPRE.
SV40 (University of Pennsylvania Vector Core). Virus injections were made at a
few sites within V1, at depths of 750, 500, and 250 μm below the cortical surface. A
volume of 200 nL of virus was injected at 100 nL/min at each depth. After each
injection, the pipette was held in place for 2 min prior to retraction to prevent
leakage. A circular cover glass (3 mm, Warner Instruments) was implanted over the
craniotomy as a cranial window, and sealed with dental acrylic (C&B-Metabond,
Parkell) mixed with black ink to reduce light transmission. Finally, a custom-
designed stainless steel head plate (eMachineShop.com) was affixed to the skull
using dental acrylic. Experiments were performed either at least 5 days after head
plate implantation for GFP-M animals, or at least 2 weeks after virus injection for
calcium imaging.
Visual stimulation. Visual stimuli were generated using custom-written codes
with the Psychtoolbox67 in MATLAB (Mathworks). Oriented grating stimuli were
displayed on a 7-inch LCD monitor situated 10 cm from the right eye. Stimuli
consisted of full-contrast sine wave gratings (spatial frequency: 0.07 cycles/degree;
temporal frequency: 2 Hz) drifting in 12 directions in a pseudorandom sequence
for 12 s each. For each trial, a static stimulus was presented for the first and the last
3 s, and the drifting stimulus was presented for the middle 6 s. Ten trials were
presented for each stimulus direction.
Calculation of visual response features. Neurons were classified as visually
responsive when, with at least one of 12 grating directions, a set of 10 responses
during drifting grating periods were significantly different from those during static
grating periods (paired t test). Orientation selective (OS) neurons were char-
acterized by applying a bimodal Gaussian fit to the tuning curve of each neuron
with the following equation:

where θ is the stimulus orientation (between 0 and 360°) and the angle brackets
indicate angular values expressed between −180 and 180°. Five parameters were
calculated from the above equation: preferred orientation θp, tuning width σ, base
response R0, response amplitudes in preferred and opposite directions, Rp and Rn,
respectively. Cells were classified as orientation selective if the goodness of the fit of
the Gaussian (R2) exceeded 0.613,68.
Two parameters were used to characterize orientation selectivity of neurons.
The first parameter, termed global orientation selectivity index (gOSI), is the vector
average of responses of all presented stimulus orientations:

The directional selectivity index (DSI) was calculated as follows:

Laser ablation experiments. To determine the optical properties of the visual
cortex, laser ablation at 1300 nm at 1 kHz repetition rate was performed. The laser
beams were raster scanned at a single depth below the pia surface for the duration
of one frame, namely 10 s (0.1 fps), using a pair of galvanometric mirrors. For the
targeted ablation field of view of 25 µm and 512 × 512 pixel rate, minimum number
of overlapping pulses resulted in 10 s of ablation duration with a 1.3 µm 1/e2 one-
photon lateral resolution.
Since visual cortex has uniform optical properties in terms of its extinction
length, the cortex can be assumed as a single layer tissue so that energy on the
surface (Esurf) is attenuated by Beer-Lambert’s law as follows:
F ¼
Esurfexp

where z is the ablation depth, lext is the extinction length of cortex, w0 is the one-
photon 1/e2 radius at the focal plane which can be calculated from the three-
photon point-spread function69 (Supplementary Figure 17a), and F is the fluence at
the focal plane. To calculate the threshold fluence and extinction length, Eq. 7 can
be reorganized as follows:
Eth;surf ¼ Fthπw2

By taking the natural logarithm of both sides in Eq. 8, a linear regression can be
applied to calculate Fth and lext:

Threshold energy (Eth,surf) for each depth is calculated by fitting percent of damage
with respect to applied energy on the surface. This fitting function is represented as
follows:

ð10Þ
After determining threshold energy for each depth, a linear regression was applied
to ablating four different depths in the visual cortex.
To mark visual cortex layers, multiple laser ablation markers were created at
multiple depths in a vertical column. The laser ablation markers were created at
250, 500, and 750 µm depths using the pump laser (1045 nm) with the following
two sets of pulse energies: (i) 1, 2, and 4 µJ at one location, and (ii) 250, 500 and
1000 nJ at another location, with 20 s laser duration, respectively.
Image analysis for ablation experiments. An image analysis algorithm was
developed to calculate percent of damage in the GCaMP6s images. First, a median
filter with a size of 2 × 2 was applied to smooth the images. Otsu’s thresholding
method70 was applied to remove background noise and to convert the images into
binary ones. Then, percent of damage was calculated by taking the ratio of dif-
ference of total number of pixels below the threshold before and after ablation
images to total number of pixels correspond to the targeted ablation area.

 Image analysis for neuronal recordings. Image analyses were performed with
custom written scripts in ImageJ and MATLAB. First, images were corrected for
X–Y movement by registration to a reference image (the pixel-wise mean of all
frames) using 2-dimensional cross correlation. Neuron cell bodies were manually
identified using the reference image in ImageJ. The time lapse change in fluores-
cence normalized by the baseline fluorescence, ΔF/F, for each neuron was calcu-
lated as ΔF/Ft = (Ft − F0) / F0, with F0 defined as the mode of the raw fluorescence
density distribution.
Immunohistochemistry. Animals were deeply anesthetized with 4% isoflurane and
perfused transcardially with 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by
chilled 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 MPBS. The brains were then postfixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS (<4 °C) overnight. The fixed brains were sectioned
into 100 μm slices with a vibratome and then blocked in 10% normal goat serum
with 0.5% triton in PBS (1 h, 25 °C) before being stained with mouse anti-NeuN
(1:250, Millipore, MAB377) overnight (<4 °C). This was followed by a 3 hour
incubation in Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse (1:200, ThermoFisher, A32728)
before being mounted on a glass slide with the Vectashield Hardset mounting
media with DAPI (Vector Labs). The slides were imaged using a confocal micro-
scope (Leica TCS SP8).
Statistics. A normality test was performed to check if samples can be described by
a Gaussian distribution before the standard t test was used to compare responses
across populations of neurons and across animals. Two-tailed, paired t test was
used for comparisons unless indicated. In a small subset of experiments that did
not pass the normality test, non-parametric statistics were used. Error bars indicate
s.e.m. unless indicated. Blind experiments were not performed in the study but the
same criteria were applied to all allocated groups for comparisons. No randomi-
zation was performed for the study. No statistical methods were used to pre-
determine sample sizes, but our sample sizes are similar to those reported in
previous publications.
