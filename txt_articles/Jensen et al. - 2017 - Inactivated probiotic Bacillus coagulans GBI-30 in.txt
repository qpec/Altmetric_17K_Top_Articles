Objective: The aim of this study was to document the immune activating and anti-inflammatory 
effects of inactivated probiotic Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (Staimune™) cells on human 
immune cells in vitro.
Methods: In vitro cultures of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy 
blood donors were treated with inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 cells for 24 hours. After 
incubation, the PBMC were stained with fluorochrome-labeled monoclonal antibodies for CD3, 
CD56, and CD69 to monitor cellular activation by flow cytometry. The culture supernatants were 
tested for cytokine profile using a 27-plex Luminex array, including pro- and anti-inflammatory 
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors.
Results: Inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 cells induced the CD69 early activation marker 
on CD3+ CD56− T lymphocytes, CD3+ CD56+ NKT cells, CD3−CD56+ NK cells, and also some 
cells within the CD3−CD56− non-T non-NK cell subset. Culture supernatants showed robust 
increases in the immune-activating cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and TNF-α. IFN-γ levels 
were increased, along with three chemokines, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β. The two anti-
inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10 showed increases, as well as the G-CSF growth factor 
involved in repair and stem cell biology. In contrast, GM-CSF levels showed a mild decrease, 
showing a highly selective growth factor response.
Conclusion: The inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 cells activated human immune cells and 
altered the production of both immune activating and anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemo-
kines. Of special importance is the novel demonstration of a selective upregulation of the G-CSF 
growth factor involved in postinjury and postinflammation repair and regeneration. This suggests 
that important immunogenic cell wall components, such as lipoteichoic acid, are undamaged after 
the inactivation and retain the complex beneficial biological activities previously demonstrated 
for the cell walls from live B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 (GanedenBC30) probiotic bacteria.
Keywords: anti-viral, anti-inflammatory, cytokines, growth factors, lipoteichoic acid, inactivated

Plain language summary
This study was done to test a new consumable health product, made by inactivating a specific 
strain of beneficial probiotic gut bacteria. We have previously shown that this strain of gut bacteria 
activates human immune cells and helps mature certain immune cells that are of importance for 
detecting foreign antigens. The inactivating process allows the bacterium to be used in broader 
applications, such as foods, where a living bacterium could spoil the food or give it a very limited

shelf life. It was important to show that the inactivated bacteria had 
similar properties to the live bacteria.
To test this, we used blood samples from healthy humans and 
isolated a part of the white blood cells that include immune cells 
and stem cells. The blood samples contained the same types of cells 
as in the blood circulation in our intestinal walls, where antigens 
from the gut are presented to immune cells. We cultured the cells 
with the inactivated bacterial cells for 24 hours. We examined the 
immune cells for their activation status. We tested the liquid culture 
medium for secreted biomarkers.
We found that the inactivated bacterial cells had similar 
effects as the live ones with respect to immune activation and anti-
inflammatory effects. We also found novel effects that showed that 
the human cells secreted a growth factor important for tissue repair 
after trauma and injury.
Introduction
The gut microbial community, “gut microbiome”, has a 
vast impact on the health of the human host.1,2 An integral 
collaboration exists between microbial forms colonizing 
the gut and our immune function, metabolism, and brain 
function.3 The interaction between gut microbes and host 
cells and tissue takes place in several ways, including 
via bacterial cell wall components and secreted metabo-
lites. The most immediate and direct interaction between 
microbes and host cells involves the outer layers of bacterial 
cell wall components engaging with receptors on immune 
cells, such as dendritic cells directly sampling antigens in 
the gut lumen. This interaction presents different types of 
bacterial cell wall components of Gram-positive versus 
Gram-negative bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria present 
lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), which are recognized by 
toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4),4 whereas the outer cell walls 
of Gram-positive bacteria present teichoic acid and lipo-
teichoic acid to immune cells, recognized by TLR-2.5 For 
many pathogenic bacteria, lipoteichoic acid is associated 
with virulence,6 whereas lipoteichoic acid from beneficial 
probiotic bacteria trigger complex beneficial immune 
modulation. Lipoteichoic acid has been widely used as a 
model TLR-2 ligand to explore a wide variety of immune 
activating mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level, 
and interestingly has proven to exert both proinflammatory7,8 
and anti-inflammatory9,10 activities in vitro. The structural 
complexity of lipoteichoic acid is said to impact the host 
immune response. The chemical composition of this acid 
differs between microbes and between strains of similar 
microbes. This is of high importance in triggering diverse 
effects on host cells and is likely one of the key factors in 
the highly selective immune-modulating effects induced by 
different microbial strains.
The consumption of beneficial probiotic bacteria is 
associated with a range of health benefits tied to inflamma-
tion regulation, such as gastrointestinal disease,11 respira-
tory tract infections,12 neuro-immune and neuropsychiatric 
disorders,13 satiety and psychosocial behavior in obese 
individuals,14 and alleviation of symptoms of anxiety and 
depression,15 as a result of the extensive communication 
between the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems, 
also referred to as the “gut–brain axis”.16 While the con-
sumption of probiotic bacteria is considered highly safe, 
there are many useful applications for inactivated probiotic 
strains, such as increased shelf life, as well as usefulness 
in many types of food products where metabolically 
active, living bacteria may spoil the appearance of the 
food. Inactivated probiotic bacteria also have a use in spe-
cific clinical situations involving immune-compromised 
individuals where there could potentially be a risk of 
translocation of gut bacteria into the bloodstream. Inacti-
vated probiotic bacteria can be produced, for example by 
heating, leaving the outer bacterial cell wall as the main 
mechanism of interaction with host immune cells. Heat-
killed Lactobacillus plantarum L-137 (HK L-137) has 
been widely studied over the past decades for its effects 
in rodents and humans. Animal studies have shown that 
consumption of HK L-137 offers protection against influ-
enza virus infection, associated with increased production 
of interferons, suggesting a general support of antiviral 
immune defense activity.17 Clinical trials have shown that 
the daily intake of HK L-137 supports a healthy immune 
function, including enhanced acquired immune responses 
and TH1-related immune function,18 and reduced incidence 
of upper respiratory tract infections.19 Consumption was 
also associated with improved oral health.20 The heat-killed 
bacterial cells are also known to exert antiallergic21 and 
antitumor22 effects, in part due to the potent induction of 
IL-12 and interferons23 by lipoteichoic acids on the bacte-
rial cell wall surfaces. Furthermore, the L-137 strain has 
higher levels of lipoteichoic acids exposed on the surface, 
with higher amounts of alanine, than the closely related 
L. plantarum JCM1149 strain;24 this correlates with the 
higher induction of IL-12 by the L-137 strain than by the 
JCM1149 strain.25
Another group of lactic acid-producing probiotic bac-
teria includes several unique strains of the spore-forming 
B. coagulans (previously classified as L. sporogenes).

Inactivated GBI‑30 and immune modulation
The teichoic acid from B. coagulans walls has a higher 
lipid content than most Gram-positive bacteria, and is a 
glycerophosphate polymer substituted with two neutral 
sugars, glucose and galactose. It is unique in lacking amino 
acid substituents, otherwise considered a characteristic of 
teichoic acids.26
Cell walls from the live B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 strain 
(GanedenBC30) have demonstrated immune modulating and 
anti-inflammatory effects in vitro.27 Our team previously 
showed that immune-modulating effects of the BC30 strain 
were associated both with the cell wall fraction and with 
the metabolites produced by the live bacteria in vitro.28 The 
probiotic strain was further shown to prolong the survival 
and reduce symptoms in mice infected with Clostridium 
difficile.29,30 Clinical studies showed that consuming BC30 
helped alter the gut microbiome by increasing the numbers 
of beneficial bacteria,31 and ex vivo testing of blood from 
elderly humans who had consumed BC30 for 28 days showed 
increased anti-inflammatory cytokine responses.32 Results 
from a recent clinical trial suggest that the consumption 
of BC30 supports exercise performance and helps reduce 
exercise-induced muscle damage.33
Recently, inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 
cells have been produced for oral consumption. The work 
presented here was undertaken to document whether the 
immune activating and anti-inflammatory properties asso-
ciated with the cell walls of the live BC30 bacteria were 
protected in the inactivated product. An important focus 
for this work was to document the biological activities of 
the inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30 bacterial cells when 
presented to human immune cells in a cell culture system 
that allows cross-talk between antigen-presenting mono-
cytes and dendritic cells with lymphocytes and natural 
killer cells, and thus mimics events in the gut mucosal 
immune tissue.
Materials and methods
Reagents
Phosphate-buffered saline, Roswell Park Memorial Insti-
tute 1640 (RPMI-1640) medium, penicillin–streptomycin 
100×, IL-2, and LPS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 
Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). CD69 fluorescein isothio-
cyanate, CD56 phycoerythrin, CD3 peridinin chlorophyll 
protein, CD25 brilliant violet 421 and heparin Vacutainer 
vials were purchased from BD Biosciences (Franklin 
Lakes, NJ, USA). The Bio-Plex Pro™ human cytokine 
27-Plex was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc. 
(Hercules, CA, USA).
Inactivated B. coagulans GBI‑30 
(Staimune™)
Inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086 cells were provided 
by Ganeden Inc. (Mayfield Heights, OH, USA). Bacterial cell 
numbers were 15 billion (1.5×1010) CFU per gram prior to 
inactivation. Inactivated bacteria were diluted in physiologi-
cal saline and added to human peripheral blood mononuclear 
cell cultures at doses from 0.78×106–100×106 inactivated 
cells/mL cell culture.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cell 
cultures
Healthy human volunteers between the age of 50 and 60 years 
served as blood donors upon informed consent, as approved 
by the Sky Lakes Medical Center Institutional Review Board 
(FWA 2603). Freshly drawn peripheral venous blood samples 
in sodium heparin were layered onto Lympholyte-Poly and 
centrifuged for 35 minutes at 450 g. The upper peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC)-rich interface was harvested using 
sterile transfer pipettes into new vials and washed twice with 
10 mL PBS, without calcium or magnesium, by centrifugation 
for 10 minutes. The cells were resuspended into RPMI 1640 
with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics 
(penicillin and streptomycin) to a cell density of 106/mL. 
Triplicate cultures were established for each of the eight doses 
of inactivated GBI-30 tested. Untreated cell cultures (negative 
controls) were established in hexaplicate. Two sets of positive 
control cultures were established in triplicates, one set using 
LPS (10 ng/mL) and another set using IL-2 (100 IU/mL) to 
activate the immune cells by two different pathways.
Cytokine testing
Supernatants were harvested from the human immune cell 
24-hour cultures, and the levels of 27 cytokines, chemokines, 
and growth factors were analyzed. Testing was performed on 
culture supernatants from cell cultures treated with the six 
higher doses of inactivated GBI-30. The following markers: 
IL-1β, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, 
IL-12 (p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, eotaxin, basic FGF, G-CSF, 
GM-CSF, Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), IP-10, MCP-1, MCAF, 
MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF-BB, RANTES, TNF-α, and VEGF 
were quantified using Bio-Plex protein arrays (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories Inc.) and utilizing xMAP technology (Luminex, 
Austin, TX, USA).
Statistical analysis
Averages and SDs for each data set were calculated using 
Microsoft Excel. Statistical analysis was performed using

indicated when P<0.05 and a high level of significance 
when P<0.01.
Results
Immune cell activation
Immune cell activation by inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30 
cells was determined by measuring cell-surface expression of 
the activation marker CD69. The gating on immune cells with 
different forward and side scatter properties allowed analysis 
of CD69 expression on lymphocytes versus monocytes/macro-
phages (Figure 1). Treatment of both cell types with inactivated 
GBI-30 cells for 24 hours resulted in activation across a broad 
dose range. The results for CD69 expression on lymphocytes 
showed that even at the lowest dose the CD69 expression was 
not returning to baseline, and suggests that much lower doses 
would still have been able to activate lymphocytes (Figure 
1A). In contrast, the most robust and statistically significant 
activation of monocytes was in a narrower dose range, return-
ing toward baseline at the lowest dose shown (Figure 1B).

Inactivated GBI‑30 and immune modulation
The use of fluorescently labeled antibodies to CD3, 
CD56, and CD69 allowed the monitoring of changes to 
lymphocyte subsets, including CD3+ T lymphocytes, CD3+ 
CD56+ Natural Killer T (NKT)  cells, CD3−CD56+ NK 
cells, and non-T non-NK lymphocytes. Treatment of PBMC 
cultures with inactivated GBI-30 cells for 24 hours led to 
the activation of T lymphocytes, NKT cells, NK cells, and 
non-T non-NK cells (Figure 2). T lymphocyte activation was 
seen across a broad dose range, and at the third-lowest dose 
(3.13×106 bacteria/mL), the CD69 expression was as robust 
as for LPS-induced CD69 expression (Figure 2A). The T 
lymphocyte activation remained highly significant even at

the lowest dose of inactivated GBI-30. Activation of NKT 
cells was also observed across the entire dose range, and at 
some doses, the activation was highly significant, compared 
to untreated control cultures (Figure 2B). NK cell activation 
was most robust at the lower doses and less prominent at 
higher doses (Figure 2C). The CD69 expression in the non-T 
non-NK lymphocyte population was seen for a broad dose 
range as well, returning to baseline at the lowest dose tested 
(Figure 2D). LPS was used as a positive control (10 ng/mL) 
and resulted in an increase in CD69 expression on all cell 
types. IL-2 was used as a second positive control (100 IU/
mL) and also showed an increase in CD69 on all cell types.
Please note that occasionally, a large variation in CD69 
expression was seen within one set of triplicate cultures, as 
reflected by large error bars, and in some cases, an average 
response in the triplicate set appears out of line with the 
overall dose response. We suggest that this is due to the 
nature of the test product, where the inactivated bacterial 
cells may clump within a culture well instead of dispersing, 
thus not providing optimal interaction between bacterial 
cells and PBMC within those wells. An example is the very 
low CD69 expression on non-T non-NK lymphocytes at 
the dose of 12.5×106 inactivated GBI-30/mL, where only 
one of the three triplicate culture wells showed the CD69 
expression level comparable to the dose above and the dose 
below (Figure 2D).
Immune‑activating cytokines B. coagulans
Supernatants from the PBMC cultures exposed to inactivated 
B. coagulans GBI-30 cells for 24 hours were simultaneously 
assayed for the levels of 27 different cytokines, chemokines, 
and growth factors, using a magnetic bead-based array and 
Luminex xMAP technology. Increases in the levels of cyto-
kines with various immune activating and regulating proper-
ties were seen. This included a robust upregulation of certain 
proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and 
TNF-α (Figure 3). Increases were also seen for the cytokines 
IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, and IL-12p70 (data not shown). Fur-
thermore, increases were seen for four biomarkers involved 
in antiviral immune defense activity, namely IFN-γ, and the 
three chemokines MCP-1, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β (Figure 4).
Anti‑inflammatory cytokines
In parallel to increases in immune-activating, proinflamma-
tory cytokines, higher doses of the inactivated B. coagulans 
GBI-30 cells also triggered robust increases in the two anti-
inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10 (Figure 5). The 
increases were comparable between these cytokines, with an 
approximal 300-fold increase above the levels in untreated 
cell cultures.
Growth factors
The exposure of human PBMC to inactivated GBI-30 
triggered changes in growth factor production (Figure 6). 
Highly selective changes were seen for the growth factors 
granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and granulo-
cyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), both 
having differential effects on stem cell biology (Figure 6A 
and B), where treatment of PBMC with inactivated GBI-30 
led to a very strong increase in G-CSF production, in contrast 
to a mild reduction in GM-CSF production.
Discussion
The work reported here on the inactivated B. coagulans 
GBI-30, 6086 cells is a direct extension of previous work 
by our team, involving the live B. coagulans GBI-30, 6086. 
Our previous results have demonstrated that the cell wall 
from BC30 has complex biological properties, including 
both immune-activating and anti-inflammatory properties.27
The current work showed that the inactivated B. 
coagulans GBI-30 cells triggered an increase in the CD69 
activation marker on multiple human immune cell types, 
whereas previous work focused only on NK cells. CD69 
is an early activation marker on many cell types, and is 
directly involved in the molecular apparatus responsible for 
NK cell-mediated killing of virus-infected and transformed 
cells.34–36 In addition, CD69 has a broad range of functions, 
including T-cell/B-cell interactions, homing of cells into 
appropriate tissue environments, and the process of gen-
erating and maintaining immunological memory.37,38 The 
ability of inactivated GBI-30 to induce CD69 on multiple 
cell types suggests a broad effect involving cells from both 
the innate and the adaptive immune systems. Further work 
will need to evaluate the various cell types in the non-T 
non-NK subset of cells, which includes dendritic cells, B 
lymphocytes, circulating hematopoietic, mesenchymal, 
and endothelial stem cells. Previous work on live BC30 
showed that exposure of human mononuclear phagocytes 
triggered a favorable maturation of antigen-presenting cells 
toward both macrophage and dendritic cell phenotypes.28 
This is important, since dendritic cells are first-line antigen-
presenting cells in gut mucosal immune tissue, capable of 
unique surveillance activity and antigen recognition across 
intact epithelial barriers,39 and therefore may represent the 
cell type that initially encounters consumed BC30 cells in 
the gut mucosa in vivo.

Inactivated GBI‑30 and immune modulation
Inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30 cells triggered robust 
increases in the production of multiple cytokines, chemo-
kines, and growth factors. The current data span a broader 
range of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors than 
previously tested for live BC30. This has helped confirm 
the potent immune-activating properties of BC30. It has also 
helped demonstrate novel biological properties associated 
with antiviral and regenerative functions. The increases in the 
biomarkers IFN-γ, MCP-1, MIP-1α, and MIP-1β, involved in 
antiviral immune defense mechanisms and cellular recruit-
ment, are of special importance. IFN-γ has direct antiviral 
properties, activates macrophages, and enhances NK cell 
killing activity of transformed cells. The three chemokines 
facilitate recruitment of immune cells to sites of inflamma-
tion, whether caused by injury or by infection. The increase 
in two anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1ra and IL-10, points 
to the complexity of inactivated GBI-30 immune modulation. 
We speculate that the anti-inflammatory effect represents a 
later part of the cascade triggered by inactivated GBI-30, 
with the purpose of resolving the initial proinflammatory 
immune activation and limiting the inflammatory process 
in space and time.
Several growth factors known to play specific roles 
in endogenous regeneration were upregulated in the 
PBMC cultures. Highly selective, contrasting effects 
were seen for the two stem cell growth factors G-CSF 
and GM-CSF. Inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30-treated 
PBMC cultures showed a robust increase in G-CSF 
levels, reaching over 7,000-fold above untreated cul-
tures at the highest dose, in contrast to mildly reduced 
GM-CSF levels. This is an important differentiation, 
since G-CSF supports stem cells to produce neutrophils, 
whereas GM-CSF promotes the production of multiple 
cell types, including eosinophils, involved in immune 
defense against multicellular parasites and also in inflam-
mation in allergies and asthma. In addition, G-CSF is 
used therapeutically to support stem cell mobilization, 
migration, and tissue repair.40 Therefore, the selective

effect of inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30 cells on 
growth factor production may be directly beneficial in 
repair and regeneration of the gut mucosal tissue, for 
example in situations of ulceration. The effect may also 
affect systemic changes via many cell types, including 
inflammation-modulating mesenchymal stem cells.41,42 
Mesenchymal stem cells are able to sense signals from, 
and migrate into injured, inflamed, and ischemic tissue. 
They can cross the blood–brain barrier and contribute 
to repair of brain injuries such as stroke. Interestingly, 
it has been shown that the treatment of mesenchymal 
stem cells from healthy human donors with IL-1, TNF-α, 
and IFN-γ production contributed to a strong increase in 
G-CSF production by the mesenchymal stem cells43 and 
subsequently the increase in G-CSF reprogrammed LPS-
activated microglial cells to secrete fewer inflammatory 
mediators. This sequential process may apply to events 
when mononuclear cells, which include multiple types of 
stem cells, are exposed to inactivated B. coagulans GBI-
30 cells. Further work is needed to document whether 
a cascade of events is triggered by inactivated GBI-30, 
where an initial immune-activating signal upregulated 
the production of proinflammatory cytokines, followed 
by anti-inflammatory processes intended to resolve the 
inflammation, combined with reparative growth factors.
Three observations from the current work reported here 
are of key importance in the validation of similar biologi-
cal activities of the inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30 cells, 
compared to the immune-modulating properties of cell wall 
fractions from living BC30: 1) Both can increase the CD69 
activation marker on lymphocytes, 2) both are able to increase 
production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6, and 3) both 
are capable of increasing the anti-inflammatory cytokine 
IL-10. This suggests that cell wall components, including 
lipoteichoic acid, have remained at least partially preserved 
by the inactivation process.
A direct dose comparison to our previous in vitro work 
is not feasible. Previous work on the cell wall’s immune-

Inactivated GBI‑30 and immune modulation
activating properties was performed on material that went 
through repeated freeze/thaw and bead-milling cycles, thus 
breaking down the cell walls into smaller particles, each 
capable of engaging appropriate receptors on the surface 
of the PBMC. In contrast, the current work involved the 
addition of intact bacterial cells to the human immune cell 
cultures.27
The complex properties of inactivated GBI-30 suggest 
possible multifaceted clinical responses after consumption, 
involving immune activation, anti-inflammatory effects, and 
effects involving stem cell mobilization, homing, and repro-
gramming involved in accelerated repair. The direct effects 
of inactivated GBI-30 are expected to translate to immune 
activation at the level of the gut mucosa and trigger rapid 
systemic effects. This is different from a study on the live 
BC30 where ingested spores will give rise to living bacteria 
that can colonize the intestinal tract, and where an impor-
tant part of the biological effects is due to secreted bacterial 
metabolites. Future work on inactivated B. coagulans GBI-30 
cells should include a human clinical study to examine acute 
effects, using the study design previously published by our 
team on efficacious immune-modulating natural products,44,45
