abstract
OBJECTIVE: This study analyzes and compares pediatric exposures to packet and nonpacket 
forms of laundry and dishwasher detergents in the United States.
METHODS: Data from the National Poison Data System involving exposures to laundry and 
dishwasher detergents among children younger than 6 years old from 2013 through 2014 
were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 62 254 children younger than 6 years old exposed to laundry and 
dishwasher detergents from 2013 to 2014. The number of exposures to detergent increased 
over the study period, but the increase was greatest for laundry detergent packets (17.0%) 
and dishwasher detergent packets (14.0%). Eighty-five percent of children were exposed 
through ingestion. The odds of clinical effects (3.9–8.2), hospitalization (4.8–23.5), 
intubation (6.9–71.3), and serious medical outcomes (8.4–22.6) were significantly higher 
for laundry detergent packet exposures than for other types of detergent. There were 117 
children who required intubation, and 104 of these were exposed to laundry detergent 
packets. There were 2 deaths, and both were associated with laundry detergent packets.
CONCLUSIONS: This national study demonstrates that pediatric laundry detergent packet 
exposures are more severe than laundry detergent nonpacket and dishwasher detergent 
(packet and nonpacket) exposures. Pediatric exposures to laundry detergent packets 
increased by 17% during the study period nationally and should be closely monitored to 
assess the effectiveness of the newly adopted voluntary safety standard; this standard 
should be strengthened if the number of exposures does not demonstrate a substantial 
decrease.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Previous 
reports have revealed that dishwasher and laundry 
detergents pose an important poisoning hazard to 
young children. A previous study conducted with data 
from the US National Poison Data System revealed 
laundry packets are particularly dangerous to 
children.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: From 2013 to 2014, 62 254 
pediatric exposures to dishwasher and laundry 
detergents were reported to US poison control 
centers. Hospitalization was observed in 0.2% of 
dishwasher and 3.3% of laundry detergent exposures. 
Laundry detergent packet exposures had more 
serious outcomes.

Dishwasher and laundry detergents 
are common household products 
that have been used for decades. 
The traditional powder and liquid 
forms of these detergents were more 
commonly used until the introduction 
of tablets and packets. Laundry 
detergent packets were introduced 
in Europe in 20011 and in the United 
States in 2012, and their associated 
hazards have been described.2, 
3 
Consequences of powder detergent 
exposure include vomiting and oral 
and esophageal burns.4–7 Exposure to 
laundry detergent packets involving 
young children can cause central 
nervous system depression, upper 
and lower airway injuries, corneal 
injury, damage to oropharyngeal 
mucosa, pneumonitis, respiratory 
depression, and death.8–13
Studies on laundry and dishwasher 
detergent exposures in the United 
States usually consist of case series, 
abstracts, or reports of national data 
limited to a short time period.10, 
14–16 One study of National Poison 
Data System (NPDS) data limited 
to pediatric exposures to laundry 
detergent packets revealed 
serious outcomes associated with 
exposure to these products among 
young children.13 Another study 
that used Texas Poison Center 
Network data to compare laundry 
detergent packets to traditional 
laundry detergent revealed that 
children exposed to laundry packets 
were more frequently referred to 
a health care facility (HCF) and 
experienced more serious outcomes 
compared with traditional laundry 
detergent.14 Recent research has 
focused on laundry detergent 
packets, and several studies have 
examined outcomes after exposure to 
dishwasher nonpacket detergent4, 
5, 
15; 
however, the toxicity of dishwasher 
detergent packet exposures has 
not been evaluated in the medical 
literature. Moreover, research on the 
comparative toxicity of traditional 
and packet forms of laundry and 
dishwasher detergents has not been 
published. To our knowledge, this 
study is the first to comprehensively 
analyze and compare pediatric 
exposures to traditional and packet 
forms of laundry and dishwasher 
detergents by using a national 
database.
METHODS
Data Sources
We retrospectively analyzed data 
from the NPDS, which is maintained 
by the American Association of 
Poison Control Centers (AAPCC). 
The AAPCC receives data on calls to 
participating poison control centers 
(PCCs) that serve the United States 
and its territories. PCCs receive 
telephone calls through the Poison 
Help Line and document information 
about the product, route of exposure, 
individual exposed, exposure 
scenario, and other data.16
Case Selection Criteria
The AAPCC’s generic codes (which 
are codes assigned to broad groups 
of related substances) for automatic 
dishwasher and laundry detergents 
were used to query the NPDS for 
all single substance exposure calls 
involving detergent among children 
younger than 6 years old during 
2013 and 2014. There were 68 845 
single exposures to dishwasher 
or laundry detergent, of which, 
62 254 met study inclusion criteria, 
including 2 deaths. These deaths 
underwent secondary review by the 
AAPCC fatality review group and 
were verified to be laundry detergent 
packet-related deaths. Detergent 
types included in the study are 
listed in Supplemental Table 5. This 
study only included unintentional 
exposures that occurred in the 50 US 
states and District of Columbia, and 
a list of excluded cases is found in 
Supplemental Table 6.
Variables
Dishwasher and laundry detergents 
were grouped into the following: 
packets (including all unit dose 
detergents) and nonpackets 
(including all nonunit dose 
detergents; Supplemental Table 5). 
Levels of health care facility (HCF) 
care received were categorized as 
seen at HCF, no HCF treatment, and 
patient refused referral/did not 
arrive at HCF. The category “seen 
at HCF” includes treated/evaluated 
and released (including held for less 
than 24 hours in observation unit), 
patient lost to follow-up/left against 
medical advice (AMA), admitted 
to critical care unit, and admitted 
to a noncritical care unit. Medical 
outcome was categorized as serious 
effect (including death and major 
effect), moderate effect, minor effect, 
no effect, not followed (judged as 
a nontoxic exposure), not followed 
(minimal clinical effects possible), 
and unable to follow (judged as a 
potentially toxic exposure). The 
NPDS outcome definitions are as 
follows: minor effect (“minimally 
bothersome to the patient, symptoms 
resolve rapidly, and usually 
involve skin or mucous membrane 
manifestations”), moderate effect 
(“more pronounced, more prolonged, 
or more of a systemic nature than 
minor symptoms and usually some 
form of treatment is or would have 
been indicated”), and major effect 
(“symptoms were life-threatening 
or resulted in significant residual 
disability or disfigurement”).17 Due 
to the relatively recent appearance 
on the market of laundry detergent 
packets and because their clinical 
effects may not have been attributed 
to the product early after their 
appearance, we analyzed all clinical 
effects, including those coded as 
related, unrelated, or unknown if 
related.
Additional variables analyzed 
included children’s gender, age, 
month of exposure, scenario 
associated with the child’s access 
to the detergent, route of exposure, 
and management site. Each of 
these categories are defined in the

NPDS manual.17 The terms “cases, 
” 
“calls, 
” and “exposures” are used 
interchangeably; they represent an 
actual or suspected exposure to a 
detergent product, as reported to a 
PCC.
Statistical Analysis and Ethical 
Considerations
NPDS data were analyzed by using 
SPSS 21.0 for Windows (IBM 
SPSS Statistics, IBM Corporation) 
and descriptive statistics were 
reported. Population data from the 
US Census Bureau were used to 
calculate exposure rates.18 Logistic 
regression was used to establish an 
association between different types 
of detergents and various outcome 
measures, which included serious 
medical outcome, HCF admission, 
clinical effects, and intubation. Odd 
ratios (ORs) were calculated along 
with the 95% confidence interval 
(CI). This study was approved by the 
institutional review board of The 
Research Institute at Nationwide 
Children’s Hospital.
RESULTS
General Characteristics
From January 2013 through 
December 2014, US PCCs received 
62 254 calls related to dishwasher 
(27 066 calls) and laundry (35 188 
calls) detergent exposures among 
children younger than 6 years old 
that satisfied the study inclusion 
criteria (Table 1). Detergent packets 
(24.2% dishwasher and 35.4% 
laundry) accounted for 59.6% of all 
exposures. The overall detergent rate 
of exposure per 10 000 US children 
younger than 6 years old was 13.0 
(4.6 for laundry packets, 3.1 for 
dishwasher packets, 2.7 for laundry 
nonpackets, and 2.5 for dishwasher 
nonpackets). From 2013 to 2014, 
the number and rate of detergent 
exposures increased by 14.3% and 
14.8%, respectively, with the highest 
increase seen among laundry packet 
(17.0% and 17.5%) and dishwasher 
packet (14.0% and 14.5%) 
exposures. After January 2013, the 
monthly number of detergent packet 
exposures exceeded the number of 
traditional detergent exposures, with 
laundry packets having the highest 
number of exposures (Fig 1).
Boys accounted for 53.4% of all 
detergent exposures (Table 1). The 
mean age of the children exposed

to detergents was 1.7 years 
(SD = 0.85) with a median age of 1.5 
years (interquartile range, 1.1–2.0). 
Children younger than 3 years of age 
accounted for the majority (86.2%) 
of cases in this study. One-year-olds 
accounted for a higher proportion of 
exposures to dishwasher detergent 
(64.0%) compared with laundry 
detergent (38.8%). Children age 
2 years accounted for 16.3% of 
dishwasher detergent exposures 
and 30.3% of laundry detergent 
exposures. Most (99.4%) exposures 
occurred in a residence, and 94.3% 
were an ingestion alone (85.0%) or 
multiple routes including ingestion 
(9.2%). Among 3264 (5.2%) cases 
where the scenario of access to the 
detergent was reported, 34.4% 
involved the detergent being stored 
within sight of the child, 20.1% 
involved the detergent stored in an 
unlocked low cabinet in the kitchen 
or bathroom, and 17.0% involved the 
detergent being temporarily open 
while in use with the caregiver being 
momentarily distracted.
Management Site, Level of Health 
Care Received, and Medical Outcome
Among all children exposed to 
detergent, 76.8% were managed 
on site at a non-HCF, 21.3% were 
seen at an HCF, and 51.2% had no 
or minor clinical effects (Table 2). 
Children exposed to laundry packets 
had a higher proportion of being 
referred to a HCF by the PCC, which 
was 17.4% compared with 4.7% 
for laundry nonpacket exposures, 
and less than 1% for dishwasher 
detergent packets and nonpackets. 
Similarly, 29.2% of children 
exposed to laundry packets were 
already in or enroute to a HCF 
when the call was made to the PCC 
compared with 12.6% for laundry 
nonpackets and even less for both 
forms of dishwasher detergents. In 
addition, the proportion of children 
who were seen in a HCF after 
exposure was highest for children 
exposed to laundry detergent 
packets (44.8%) compared with 
those exposed to other types of 
detergent (16.9% for laundry 
nonpackets, 4.7% for dishwasher 
packets, and 3.9% for dishwasher 
nonpackets).
Among the 1.9% of all children who 
were admitted to a HCF, 97.5% 
were exposed through ingestion or 
aspiration. Moderate effects were 
observed in 3.1% of the exposures, 
and only 0.2% of the exposures 
resulted in serious medical outcomes 
(including 2 deaths that were 
associated with laundry detergent 
packets; Table 2). The odds of being 
admitted to a HCF were significantly 
higher for children exposed to 
laundry detergent packets than 
those exposed to laundry detergent 
nonpackets (OR: 4.8; 95% CI: 4.0–
5.8), dishwasher detergent packets 
(OR: 23.5; 95% CI: 16.4–33.6), and 
dishwasher detergent nonpackets 
(OR: 21.5; 95% CI: 14.6–31.5; 
Table 2). Similarly, children who 
were exposed to laundry detergent 
packets also had higher odds of 
having serious medical outcomes 
compared with laundry detergent 
nonpackets (OR: 8.4; 95% CI: 3.9–
18.2), dishwasher detergent packets 
(OR: 22.6; 95% CI: 7.2–71.4), and 
dishwasher detergent nonpackets 
(OR: 18.0; 95% CI: 5.7–56.8). There 
were no significant differences in the 
odds of being admitted to a 
HCF (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 0.3–6.2) or 
having serious medical outcomes 
(OR: 0.8; 95% CI: 0.2–3.9) for 
those exposed to dishwasher 
detergent packets compared with 
those exposed to dishwasher 
detergent nonpackets. Among all 
laundry packet exposures, laundry 
detergent packets containing liquid 
components accounted for 98.3% of 
the exposures; children exposed to 
them had a 2.0 (95% CI: 1.03–3.92; 
P = .038) times higher odds of being 
admitted to a HCF than those exposed 
to laundry packets containing only 
granules.
Clinical Effects
Of all children exposed to dishwasher 
or laundry detergent, 43.5% 
experienced 1 or more clinical effects. 
The most frequent clinical effects 
experienced by those who were 
exposed to any form of detergent 
were vomiting (29.1%), cough/
choke (8.3%), ocular–irritation/
pain (5.6%), red eye/conjunctivitis 
(3.4%), and drowsiness/lethargy 
(2.8%; Table 3). Children exposed to 
laundry detergent packets had higher 
odds of experiencing 1 or more 
clinical effects than those exposed to 
laundry detergent nonpackets (OR:

3.9; 95% CI: 3.7–4.1), dishwasher 
packets (OR: 5.6; 95% CI: 5.4–5.9), 
and dishwasher nonpackets (OR: 8.2; 
95% CI: 7.8–8.6). Serious 
clinical effects observed for 
laundry detergent packet exposures 
and not for any other type of 
detergent exposures included 
the following: coma (17 cases), 
respiratory arrest (6 cases), 
pulmonary edema (4 cases), and 
cardiac arrest (2 cases).
Therapies
For all children exposed to 
dishwasher or laundry detergent, 
the most commonly used therapies 
were dilute/irrigate/wash (76.5%) 
and food/snack (10.7%; Table 4). 
Intubation was performed in 4 
cases of dishwasher detergent (3 
nonpackets and 1 packet) exposure 
and 113 cases of laundry detergent 
(9 nonpackets and 104 packets) 
exposure. The odds of being 
intubated were significantly higher 
for children exposed to laundry 
detergent packets than those exposed 
to laundry detergent nonpackets 
(OR: 6.9; 95% CI: 3.5–13.6), 
dishwasher packets (OR: 71.3; 95% 
CI: 10.0–511.7), and dishwasher 
nonpackets (OR: 18.9; 95% CI: 
6.0–59.6). Vasopressors were used 
only for laundry detergent exposures 
(1 nonpacket and 7 packets), and 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR; 
3 cases) and cardioversion (1 case) 
were used only for laundry packet 
exposures.
DISCUSSION
In 2013 and 2014, 62 254 exposures 
associated with laundry and 
dishwasher detergent were reported 
to US PCCs, and almost 60% of those 
involved detergent packets. After 
January 2013, the monthly number 
of detergent packet exposures 
exceeded that of traditional detergent 
exposures, with laundry packets 
having the highest number of 
exposures. The increase in laundry 
packet exposures is likely due to the 
increase in their use and presence in 
homes.13
Children younger than 3 years of age 
accounted for the majority (86.2%) 
of cases in this study, which agrees 
with findings by others.13,

proportion of exposures among this 
age group is most likely due to the 
large amount of time they spend in 
the home, their newfound mobility, 
and their curiosity leading to 
exploratory and mouthing behavior.
Children exposed to laundry 
detergent packets were referred to 
a HCF by a PCC specialist and were 
treated at a HCF more frequently 
than those exposed to other types 
of detergent. This is due to the 
known toxicity associated with these 
products.13 Children exposed to 
laundry detergent packets had 3.9 to 
8.2 times higher odds of developing 
1 or more clinical effects compared 
with those exposed to other types of 
detergent. This may also explain why 
almost 30% of the children exposed 
to laundry packets were already in 
or enroute to a HCF when the call 
was made to the PCC compared with 
smaller proportions for other types 
of detergent.
In this study, children exposed 
to laundry detergent packets had 
significantly higher odds of being 
admitted to a HCF (4.8–23.5) or 
having a serious medical outcome 
(8.4–22.6) than those exposed 
to other types of detergent. 
Furthermore, serious clinical effects, 
such as coma, respiratory arrest, 
pulmonary edema, cardiac arrest, 
and death were only observed 
among children exposed to laundry 
detergent packets and not for those 
exposed to other types of detergents. 
The odds of being intubated were 
significantly higher for children 
exposed to laundry detergent 
packets than those exposed to 
other types of detergent. CPR and 
cardioversion were only used in 
laundry detergent packet exposures. 
These findings corroborate 
those in a previous study.13 It is 
unknown why more severe clinical 
effects and medical outcomes are 
observed among laundry packet 
exposures than among traditional 
laundry detergent and dishwasher 
detergent (packets and nonpackets) 
exposures.20 Differences in chemical 
composition and concentration 
between laundry detergent packets 
and other types of detergents may 
account for the higher toxicity 
observed for laundry detergent 
packets.13 The possible contribution 
to clinical effects of the water-soluble 
membrane that surrounds laundry 
detergent packets remains unknown. 
There were no significant differences 
in the odds of having serious 
medical outcomes or being 
hospitalized between dishwasher 
detergent packet and nonpacket 
exposures. In addition, children 
exposed to laundry detergent packets 
containing liquid components 
experienced an odds of being 
admitted to a HCF that was twice 
that of those exposed to laundry 
packets containing only granules. 
These observations support the focus 
on liquid laundry detergent packets, 
rather than all detergent packets, 
in the recently adopted ASTM 
International F3159-15 voluntary 
safety standard for liquid laundry 
packets.21

Perhaps because dishwasher 
detergents have become safer, 
or, more likely, because laundry 
detergent products have become 
more toxic, our findings reveal that 
the old knowledge found in medical 
and toxicology textbooks that (mostly 
cationic) dishwasher detergents are 
more dangerous than (mostly anionic 
or nonionic) laundry detergents is 
no longer correct.22, 
23 Further, our 
findings demonstrate that laundry 
detergent packets are more toxic than 
other types of detergents. Exposure 
to these detergent packets can lead 
to serious clinical effects, including 
death, which corroborates findings of 
other studies.10, 
13, 
14 The Consumers 
Union has recommended that this 
product not be used, which is only 
the second time in its history that it 
has made such a strong statement.24 
The industry has recognized the risk 
associated with pediatric laundry 
packet exposures and has taken 
steps in the right direction to help 
prevent these exposures. The ASTM 
F3159-15 safety standard has been 
adopted; however, this standard has 
a number of weaknesses that could 
potentially limit its effectiveness. 
It permits the industry to meet the 
requirement for a child resistant 
container in 6 different ways rather 
than use the proven-effective 
Poison Prevention Packaging 
Act performance standard.25 The 
standard also does not require that 
packets be individually wrapped in 
a child-resistant enclosure, which 
would add layers of protection and 
help address the scenarios when a 
packet is accessed after it is removed 
from the container or when the 
container is momentarily left open. 
Some dishwasher detergent packets 
currently on the market already 
come individually wrapped, which 
refutes the argument that the public 
would find this too inconvenient. 
The standard also does not address 
the possibility that the design, color, 
or fragrance of the packets may 
attract young children, which is an 
area requiring further research. 
In addition, changing the chemical 
composition of the packets to reduce 
their toxicity remains unaddressed. 
Pediatric exposures to laundry 
detergent packets should be closely 
monitored nationally to assess the 
effectiveness of the newly adopted 
voluntary safety standard. House 
Bill 1139, the Detergent Poisoning 
and Child Safety Act of 2015, was 
introduced into the US Congress in 
February 2015.26 This bill would 
allow the US Consumer Product 
Safety Commission to create a 
mandatory safety standard for 
liquid laundry detergent packets 
if a voluntary standard does not 
adequately address the safety issues.
In addition to changing the 
packaging and chemical composition 
of packets, educational efforts and 
public awareness may help 
prevent detergent exposures. The 
most frequently reported scenario 
of access among all exposures was 
“stored within sight of child, 
” 
followed by “stored in unlocked low 
cabinet in kitchen or bathroom, 
” 
and “product temporarily open.” 
Detergents should be stored up 
and out of sight of children and in 
a locked cabinet to help prevent 
exposures. When detergents are in 
use, parents and child caregivers 
should not leave the product 
accessible to children. Health care 
providers should counsel parents 
and caregivers about the dangers 
associated with detergent exposure 
and recommend safe storage and 
use of these products. Households 
with children younger than 6 years 
of age should be encouraged to use 
traditional laundry detergent rather 
than laundry detergent packets.
This study has a number of 
limitations. The number of 
pediatric exposures to detergent 
is underestimated because not all 
exposures are reported to PCCs. Data 
coding errors, including miscoding of 
detergent type, may have occurred. 
The NPDS relies on self-reports 
from parents, caregivers, and health 
care professionals, which cannot 
be completely verified by PCCs or 
the AAPCC. Reported exposures 
do not necessarily represent a 
poisoning or overdose. Additionally, 
some reporting fields are optional, 
such as the scenario associated with 
the child’s access to the detergent, 
which may limit interpretation. Also, 
PCC specialists may be more likely 
to record a detailed account of the 
exposure if the outcome is more 
severe; therefore, more information 
may be available for serious cases 
than less serious ones. Despite these 
limitations, data in the NPDS national 
database are entered by highly 
qualified poison experts by using strict 
quality controls and case follow-up 
methods. The NPDS offers the most 
inclusive and comprehensive database 
available for research on detergent 
exposures among US children.
CONCLUSIONS
This national study demonstrates 
that pediatric laundry detergent 
packet exposures are more severe 
than laundry detergent nonpacket 
and dishwasher detergent (packet 
and nonpacket) exposures. Pediatric 
exposures to laundry detergent 
packets increased by 17% from 2013 
to 2014 nationally; exposures should 
be closely monitored to assess the 
effectiveness of the newly adopted 
voluntary safety standard, and this 
standard should be strengthened if 
the number of exposures does not 
demonstrate a substantial decrease.
