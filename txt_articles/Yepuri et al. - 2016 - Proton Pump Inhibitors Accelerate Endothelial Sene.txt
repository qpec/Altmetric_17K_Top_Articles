P
roton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as esomeprazole 
(Nexium), are widely used drugs for the treatment of gas-
troesophageal reflux disease. In the United States, these drugs 
are sold over the counter, and thus, medical supervision is 
not required. Although these agents are effective, they were 
never approved by regulatory authorities for long-term use. 
Furthermore, evidence suggests that ≤70% of PPI use may 
be inappropriate.1 Recent large and well-controlled epide-
miological and retrospective studies have found associations 
between the use of PPIs and an increased prevalence of myo-
cardial infarction, renal failure, and dementia.2–5 However, in 
the absence of a mechanism and without evidence of causal-
ity, global regulatory authorities have not restricted the use of 
PPIs. In this study, we provide evidence that chronic exposure 
to proton pump inhibition accelerates senescence in human 
endothelial cells (ECs), a unifying mechanism that may ex-
plain the association of adverse cardiovascular, renal, and neu-
rological effects with the use of PPIs.

In the low-pH conditions of the gastric parietal cell, 
PPIs are converted to the active sulfenic acid form.3,6 When 
activated, the PPIs form a mixed disulfide with the proton 
pump of the parietal cell to inhibit its secretion of HCl into the 
stomach.7,8 Physicians have prescribed these drugs with the 
perception that these agents have specificity for the parietal 
cells of the stomach. However, similar proton pumps are also 
found in cell lysosomes.9 An earlier publication found no evi-
dence that the PPI rabeprazole impaired lysosomal activity in 
hepatic cells.10 However, we wondered if PPIs may also affect 
endothelial lysosomes and disrupt proteostasis. Our rationale 
for testing this hypothesis is that endothelial dysfunction is 
known to contribute to the pathogenesis of myocardial infarc-
tion, renal failure, and dementia.11–13

Rationale: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are popular drugs for gastroesophageal reflux, which are now available for 
long-term use without medical supervision. Recent reports suggest that PPI use is associated with cardiovascular, 
renal, and neurological morbidity.
Objective: To study the long-term effect of PPIs on endothelial dysfunction and senescence and investigate the 
mechanism involved in PPI-induced vascular dysfunction.
Methods and Results: Chronic exposure to PPIs impaired endothelial function and accelerated human endothelial 
senescence by reducing telomere length.
Conclusions: Our data may provide a unifying mechanism for the association of PPI use with increased risk 
of cardiovascular, renal, and neurological morbidity and mortality.

that is taken up by endocytosis, we observed fluorescence in 
a perinuclear distribution consistent with lysosomal localiza-
tion in EC treated with vehicle. In ECs chronically exposed to 
esomeprazole, fluorescence intensity was significantly reduced, 
consistent with an increase in lysosomal pH (Figure 1A). We 
repeated these studies using a second pH-sensitive fluores-
cent dye and obtained qualitatively similar findings (Online 
Figure I). An impairment in the lysosomal proton pump and 
an increase in lysosomal pH would be expected to impair lyso-
somal enzymes, which are optimally active at a pH of ≈4.80.14,15 
Indeed, the activity of lysosomal cathepsin-B and acid phospha-
tase was reduced in ECs treated chronically with esomeprazole 
(Figure 1B, 1C, and 1E). We did not observe any difference 
in N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase activity (Online Figure II). 
Using a commercially available protein aggregation detection 
dye, together with image quantification software to quantify 
protein aggregates, we observed an increase in protein aggre-
gates in the esomeprazole-treated ECs (Figure 1D and 1F). 
These studies indicate that PPIs impair endothelial lysosomal 
acidification, enzyme activity, and proteostasis.
PPI Esomeprazole Impairs Endothelial Function
Disruption of proteostasis is associated with a global deteriora-
tion of cell function and accelerated cell aging.16–18 A hallmark 
of endothelial dysfunction is an increase in the generation of su-
peroxide anion19,20 and a decrease in nitric oxide (NO) levels.21 
Using fluorescent live cell imaging dyes, we observed that by 
comparison with EC treated with vehicle, those treated chroni-
cally with esomeprazole produced more superoxide anion as 
measured by dihydroethidium and generated less NO as mea-
sured by diamino fluorescein 2-diacetate staining. This impair-
ment in EC function was confirmed by a decrease in total nitrate 
levels as detected by Griess colorimetric assay (Figure 2A–2E) 
in the esomeprazole-treated group. We also observed a decrease 
in the expression of DDAH1/2 (dimethylarginine dimethylami-
nohydrolase, isoforms 1 or 2), eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide 
synthase), and iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) (Online 
Figure IIIA–IIID); a reduced expression of these critical en-
zymes in the NO synthase pathway would explain a decline in 
EC NO generation. Because NO plays a key role in EC prolifer-
ation and angiogenesis,22 we also assessed these EC functions. 
Chronic exposure to esomeprazole dose-dependently impaired 
cell proliferation as measured by 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine as-
say (Figure 2F), a finding which was confirmed using a real-
time cell analyzer, which assesses cell growth (Figure 2G). 
Additional studies revealed that chronic exposure (3 passages) 
to a concentration of esomeprazole as low as 1 μmol/L signifi-
cantly reduced EC proliferation as measured by real-time cell 
analyzer (Online Figure IV). Consistent with these observations, 
we observed that chronic esomeprazole treatment increased the 
expression of cell cycle inhibitor p21 gene (Figure 2H). Finally, 
we noted that esomeprazole impaired the angiogenic capacity 
of ECs as measured by network formation on growth factor–
depleted matrigel (Figure 2I–2L). These results indicate that 
esomeprazole impairs multiple endothelial functions.
PPI Esomeprazole Accelerates Endothelial Aging
Impairment of proteostasis and reduced cell proliferation are 
hallmarks of cellular senescence.18,23 To determine if cells chron-
ically treated with PPIs exhibited other features of senescence, 
we assessed the effect of chronic treatment with esomeprazole 
or with SCH-28080 (another H+K+ ATPase inhibitor with a po-
tency similar to omeprazole, IC50 of 2.5 and 4.0 μmol/L, respec-
tively). We found that senescence-associated β-galactosidase 
(SA-β-gal)–positive cells were increased by comparison to ve-
hicle (Figure 3A, 3B, 3D, and 3E) as early as P6 in both esome-
prazole- and SCH-28080–treated groups. Also, we observed 
a decrease in total cell count per microscopic field (Figure 3E 
and 3F) by SYTO-green staining consistent with a decline in 
cell proliferation. We also noted a change in the morphology in 
some of the PPI-treated cells; some of which adopted the fried-
egg morphology characteristic of senescent EC. Interestingly, 
we did not see any significant difference in SA-β-gal–positive 
cell or total cell count on treatment with ranitidine (Online 
Figure VA–VC; ranitidine is a H2 histamine receptor antagonist, 
which is used as an alternative treatment for gastroesophageal 
reflux disease). We further investigated the expression of 331 
genes from 5 different molecular pathways (cellular senescence, 
EC biology, angiogenesis, transforming growth factor-β–bone 
morphogenic protein, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition 
signaling pathways) involved in esomeprazole-induced endo-
thelial dysfunction using polymerase chain reaction array. We 
observed that 52 genes were upregulated (>2-fold increase) 
and 49 genes were downregulated (>0.5-fold of control value). 
In general, the changes in gene expression were consistent 
with those observed in endothelial senescence, for example, 
increased expression of genes involved in endothelial-to-mes-
enchymal transition (EndoMT), inflammation, and increased 
oxidative stress (Online Tables 1 and 2). We selected several 
of these genes for validation. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 
is a well-known marker for endothelial dysfunctions, for exam-
ple, increased thrombogenicity, immune activation, oxidative 
stress, and senescence.24 We found that plasminogen activator 
inhibitor message and protein expression were upregulated in 
esomeprazole-treated cells (Figure 3G–3I). We also found that 
genes associated with EndoMT, including TWIST1, COL1A1, 
and SMAD3 (Online Figure VIA–VIC), were upregulated, to-
gether with a decline in the expression of von Willebrand factor 
(Online Figure VID), a marker for vascular endothelium. In ad-
ditional studies, after treating ECs with esomeprazole (5 or 10 
μmol/L) or vehicle for 3 passages, we discontinued treatment 
and maintained the ECs in an endothelial growth medium at 
the same passage for ≈3 months. At the 3-month time point, the 
ECs that had been exposed to vehicle remained confluent, with 
occasional apoptotic and senescent cells. By contrast, there was 
a qualitative difference in the cells that had been exposed to 
esomeprazole, with most high-power fields, showing some cell 
loss or EndoMT (Online Figure VII). To conclude, chronic ex-
posure to a PPI induces endothelial dysfunction consistent with 
EndoMT and senescence.

PPIs Induce Telomere Shortening
Endothelial senescence is associated with attrition of telomere 
length,25 whereas restoration of EC telomere length can re-
verse senescence-associated endothelial dysfunction.26,27 As 
expected, ECs in either group did not manifest telomerase 
expression (data not shown) or activity (Online Figure VIII). 
Using monochrome multiplex quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction as we have previously described,27 we observed a 
significant decrease in telomere length in esomeprazole-
treated group compared with vehicle (Figure 4A). To assess 
the mechanism of telomere shortening, we examined the 
expression of genes involved in regulating the shelterin com-
plex. The shelterin complex is encoded by 6 genes (TRF1, 
TRF2, POT1, RAP1, TIN2, and TPP1) involved in regulation 
and maintenance of telomere length and function.28 We ob-
served a global downregulation of all 6 genes of the shelterin 
complex (Figure 4C–4H), which could explain, in part, the 
effect of the PPI to accelerate telomere erosion.
Discussion
The salient findings of this study are that long-term exposure 
to proton pump inhibition (1) impairs lysosomal acidification

and enzyme activity, in association with protein aggregate ac-
cumulation; (2) increases the generation of reactive oxygen 
species and impairs the NO synthase pathway; (3) accelerates 
telomere erosion in association with reduced expression of the 
shelterin complex; and (4) speeds endothelial aging as mani-
fested by impaired cell proliferation and angiogenesis, togeth-
er with histological markers of senescence and EndoMT. Our 
results in primary human ECs are consistent with the recent 
finding that PPIs impair the activity of lysosomal enzymes 
in several immortalized cell lines, including A549, Caco2, 
HEK293, and HepG2.15 Lysosomes bind to autophagosomes 
to complete the process of autophagy,29 which comprises the 
degradation and elimination of unwanted cellular products, 
including misfolded proteins.14,15 An impairment of lysosomal 
acidification and reduced lysosomal enzyme activity might be 
expected to result in an accumulation of protein aggregates.

Our studies were conducted in a clinically relevant dose 
range. In adults, the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) of 
esomeprazole is 4.7 μmol/L with the 40-mg dose.30,31 The 
metabolism of esomeprazole is dependent on the isoenzyme 
CYP2C19, which exhibits polymorphism. About 3% of whites 
and 23% of Asians are poor metabolizers and may experience 
a 3-fold increase in plasma concentration of esomeprazole.30,32
In addition, we find that chronic PPI exposure upregu-
lates genes that are involved in EndoMT and is associated 
with histological changes consistent with EndoMT. EndoMT 
is a feature of senescent ECs and may itself play an impor-
tant role in cardiovascular disease, as well as other disorders 
characterized by fibrosis and loss of the microvasculature.33 
Furthermore, we show that esomeprazole downregulates the 
expression of the shelterin complex genes, in association with 
a reduction in telomere length. There is little known on the 
association of endothelial dysfunction with downregulation 
of the shelterin complex, and this observation merits further 
investigation.34 An observation of clinical importance is that 
ranitidine, an alternative treatment for gastroesophageal reflux 
disease, which acts by a different mechanism than the PPIs, 
does not have an adverse effect on endothelial aging.
A limitation of this study is that we have not tested the full 
range of PPIs that are commercially available. Furthermore, 
we have not determined how the PPIs are altering lysosomal 
pH although we think that the effect is related to their bind-
ing to the lysosomal proton pump. Finally, we have not deter-
mined if the effect of the PPIs to accelerate aging of human 
ECs occurs in vivo. Whereas our previous work has indicated 
that short-term use of PPIs does not significantly alter endo-
thelial function,35 chronic use must now be addressed in ran-
domized clinical trials.

To conclude, we found that chronic exposure of human 
ECs to the PPIs, esomeprazole or SCH-28080, accelerates en-
dothelial aging. This adverse effect seems to be because of an 
inhibition of lysosomal acidification and subsequent impair-
ment of proteostasis. The accumulation of protein aggregates 
is associated with an increase in oxidative stress, endothelial 
dysfunction, and senescence. Vascular senescence would pro-
vide a mechanistic explanation11–13 for the accumulating evi-
dence that PPIs increase the risk of cardiovascular morbidity 
and mortality, renal failure, and dementia.2–5 In the presence 
of consistent epidemiological evidence of harm and a unifying 
mechanism for the disparate disorders linked to PPI use and 
with the knowledge that PPIs are being used by millions of 
people for indications and durations that were never tested or 
approved, it is time for the pharmaceutical industry and regu-
latory agencies to revisit the specificity and the safety of these 
agents.

What Is Known?
• Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) inhibit H+K+ATPase proton pumps in the 
stomach to reduce acid secretion.
• PPIs are commonly used for gastroesophageal reflux.
• Accumulating observational data indicates an association between the 
use of PPIs and the increased risk of heart attack, dementia, and renal 
failure.
What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
• PPIs impair acidification and enzyme activity in endothelial lysosomes.
• Subsequently, protein aggregates accumulate with increased oxida-
tive stress.
• Endothelial dysfunctions with telomere shortening and accelerated 
senescence are observed.
These studies reveal that chronic exposure of human endothelial 
cells to PPIs disturbs proteostasis and accelerates senescence. 
Accelerated vascular aging may be a mechanistic link for the in-
creased association of cardiac, neurological, and renal morbidity 
in PPI users. Although short-term use of PPIs is relatively safe 
and effective for gastroesophageal reflux disease, the long-term 
use of PPIs without medical supervision should be re-examined. 
Clinical studies to assess the long-term effects of PPIs on vascu-
lar health are indicated.
