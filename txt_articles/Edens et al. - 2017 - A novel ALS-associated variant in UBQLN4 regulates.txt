Abstract The etiological underpinnings of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are complex and
incompletely understood, although contributions to pathogenesis by regulators of proteolytic
pathways have become increasingly apparent. Here, we present a novel variant in UBQLN4 that is
associated with ALS and show that its expression compromises motor axon morphogenesis in
mouse motor neurons and in zebrafish. We further demonstrate that the ALS-associated UBQLN4
variant impairs proteasomal function, and identify the Wnt signaling pathway effector beta-catenin
as a UBQLN4 substrate. Inhibition of beta-catenin function rescues the UBQLN4 variant-induced
motor axon phenotypes. These findings provide a strong link between the regulation of axonal
morphogenesis and a new ALS-associated gene variant mediated by protein degradation
pathways.

Introduction
Ubiquilins belong to the ubiquitin-like family of proteins and act broadly as key regulators of degra-
dative processes. The best understood function of ubiquilins is in the ubiquitin proteasome system
(UPS), where they recognize and bind polyubiquitinated substrate proteins through a C-terminal
ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain and deliver them to the proteasome through an N-terminal ubiq-
uitin-like (UBL) domain (Marı
´n, 2014). Additional roles for ubiquilins in autophagy and ER-associated
degradation have also been described (Hjerpe et al., 2016; Lee and Brown, 2012; Lim et al.,
2009). The UPS and autophagy are indispensible for multiple aspects of neuronal development
(Cecconi and Levine, 2008; Hamilton and Zito, 2013) and are crucial in maintaining homeostasis in
the aging nervous system (Groen and Gillingwater, 2015; Rezania and Roos, 2013). Dysfunction of
these pathways contributes to neurodegenerative diseases characterized by protein aggregation
(Huang et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2015). Accordingly, variants in
UBQLN1 and UBQLN2 have been linked to neurological disorders. The ubiquilin1 protein, encoded
by UBQLN1, has been associated with neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is pro-
posed to contribute to protein aggregates characteristic of AD pathology (El Ayadi et al., 2012;
Mah et al., 2000). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in UBQLN1 were suggested to confer suscepti-
bility to Alzheimer’s disease (Bertram et al., 2005; Kamboh et al., 2006). Mutations in UBQLN2
have been related to familial X-linked ALS/FTD (Deng et al., 2011) and heterogeneous X-linked
dominant neurodegeneration (Fahed et al., 2014). Here, we report a novel variant in UBQLN4 that
is associated with ALS and demonstrate a mechanism by which wild-type UBQLN4 may regulate

 motor axon morphogenesis. We also reveal how dysregulation of this mechanism by the ALS-associ-
ated variant leads to abnormal motor neuron structure and function through impaired degradation
and substrate retention.
Results
Identification of an ALS-associated UBQLN4 variant in familial ALS that
affects motor axon morphogenesis
Mutations in UBQLN2 have been identified in ALS patients with or without dementia (Deng et al.,
2011). A variant, E54D, in UBQLN1 has been reported in a single patient with atypical motor neuron
disease consistent with Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome (Gonza
´lez-Pe
´rez et al., 2012). These
data suggest a role for ubiquilins in motor neuron diseases. UBQLN4, like UBQLN1 and UBQLN2, is
widely expressed and shows substantial homology to human UBQLN2 (Marı
´n, 2014). To test if
genetic variants of UBQLN4 are involved in the etiology of ALS, we screened its 11 exons with pri-
mers covering coding regions and the exon-intron boundaries. We examined 267 familial ALS index
cases and 411 sporadic ALS cases, and identified a variant in a familial ALS case (Figure 1A). This
variant, c.269A>C, was located in exon 3, leading to the change of aspartate to alanine, p.D90A at
the protein level (Figure 1C). The female patient (III3) with this UBQLN4D90A variant had an age of
disease onset at 55 years, with disease duration of two years. Her mother (II3), maternal aunt (II2)
and a maternal cousin (III1) also developed ALS and died of respiratory failure two to five years fol-
lowing disease onset. The variant was neither present in our 332 in-house controls, nor in any SNP
databases with a total of >15,000 sequenced alleles nor in the Exome Aggregation Consortium
(ExAC) database in a total of 60,706 unrelated individuals. The amino acid D90 is adjacent to the
eLife digest Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS for short, is a disease in which parts of the
brain and spinal cord progressively degenerate. Specifically, the condition causes the nerve cells that
control movement – called motor neurons – to die. As a result, people with ALS lose control of their
muscles. The cause of ALS is not known, but evidence suggests that a person’s genetics plays a role
in the development of the disease. Learning which genes are involved and what they do within cells
may help scientists figure out what goes wrong in patients with ALS and how to treat the condition.
People with ALS often experience an abnormal build up of proteins in their brain and spinal cord.
Cells normally rely on molecules working together in the so-called ubiquitin proteasome system to
eliminate unwanted proteins. A few mutations linked with ALS, and some other neurodegenerative
conditions, have been traced back to genes encoding parts of this protein disposal system, which
may help to explain the build up of proteins. However, our understanding of the genetic causes of
the disease is far from complete.
Now, Edens et al. report a new mutation in a gene that encodes a protein involved in the
ubiquitin proteasome system. The gene, called UBQLN4, had not previously been linked to ALS, but
looking at this gene in nearly 700 patients with ALS revealed a mutation in one patient with an
inherited form of the disease. This mutation was not found in public databases that contain genetic
information from tens of thousands of people without ALS.
To better understand the effect of this newly identified mutation, Edens et al. recreated it in
zebrafish embryos and motor neurons from mice. The mutation in UBQLN4 changed the shape of
the cells in the spinal cords of the zebrafish and the mouse motor neurons. There was also a build
up of excess proteins because the breakdown of proteins by the ubiquitin proteasome system was
slowed. Specifically, there was an excess amount of a protein called beta-catenin, which is important
for development and activity of the nervous system. Treating the mutant motor neuron cells with a
drug called quercetin, which suppresses beta-catenin, reversed the defects seen in the cells. Larger
studies are now needed to see how often this mutation occurs in patients with ALS and to
determine if other forms of the disease might have a similar cause.

 UBL domain of UBQLN4 (Figure 1B) and is highly conserved during evolution, suggesting its impor-
tance in structural and functional properties of the protein.
To assess the effects of the ALS-associated variant, we expressed wild-type or disease-associated
UBQLN4 in cultured mouse spinal motor neurons (Figure 2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 1).
UBQLN4D90A-expressing cells showed a significant increase in the total number of neurites as com-
pared to cells expressing wild-type UBQLN4, or non-transfected cells (Figure 2A,C). Importantly,
these results were validated in vivo in zebrafish. When mRNAs encoding UBQLN4-WT or
UBQLN4D90A were injected into zebrafish embryos, we observed abnormal motor axon branching in
UBQLN4D90A but not UBQLN4-WT or uninjected embryos (Figure 2B,D). Both UBQLN4-WT and
UBQLN4D90A-injected fish embryos otherwise developed normally and showed neither gross mor-
phological abnormalities nor significant changes in motor axon length, suggesting specificity of the
motor axon branching phenotype. In all experiments, expression levels of UBQLN4-WT and
UBQLN4D90A were comparable (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C). These results indicate that
the ALS-associated UBQLN4 variant interferes with normal motor axon morphogenesis in culture
and in vivo.
Expression of UBQLN4D90A leads to reduced proteasomal efficiency
and accumulation of beta-catenin
Given the role ubiquilins play in the UPS, we sought to determine if UBQLN4D90A affects protea-
some-mediated degradation. We used the UbG76V-GFP fusion protein as a reporter for UPS function
(Dantuma et al., 2000). The G76V substitution produces an uncleavable ubiquitin moiety that acts
as a proteasome degradation signal, thereby targeting GFP for proteasomal degradation. Rates of
UPS-dependent protein turnover can therefore be monitored by GFP protein level. We transfected
NSC-34 cells, a motor neuron-derived cell line, with UbG76V-GFP, UbG76V-GFP + UBQLN4-WT, or
UbG76V-GFP + UBQLN4D90A and compared GFP levels. UBQLN4D90A expression resulted in reduced
protein turnover, as indicated by significantly greater GFP signal compared to UBQLN4-WT or
UbG76V-GFP alone (Figure 3A,B). We further confirmed this finding with cycloheximide protein

 stability assay (Figure 3C,D). Cells transfected with UbG76V-GFP alone or UbG76V-GFP + UBQLN4-
WT showed a gradual reduction in GFP levels due to proteasomal degradation in the presence of
protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. Cells transfected with UbG76V-GFP + UBQLN4D90A showed
much less GFP degradation, indicating impairment of proteasomal function by the ALS-associated
UBQLN4D90A variant (Figure 3C,D). Taken together, these results suggest that UBQLN4D90A impairs
proteasomal function.
Recently, loss of the ubiquitin-like modifier-activating enzyme 1 (UBA1) was shown to cause motor
axon abnormalities similar to what we observed. In the UBA1 study, the phenotypes were shown to
result from heightened beta-catenin signaling, caused by loss of Uba1 and dysfunction of ubiquitina-
tion pathways (Wishart et al., 2014). Given our finding that UBQLN4D90A results in reduced protea-
somal efficiency, we sought to determine if it also affects beta-catenin levels. We first compared
beta-catenin levels in UBQLN4-WT, UBQLN4D90A and non-transfected NSC-34 cells (Figure 3E).
There was a significant decrease in beta-catenin in UBQLN4-WT-expressing cells compared to non-
transfected cells, suggesting a role for UBQLN4 in facilitating beta-catenin degradation. Moreover,
we detected a significant increase of beta-catenin in UBQLN4D90A-expressing cells compared to
those expressing UBQLN4-WT, suggesting that the UBQLN4D90A mutation disrupts beta-catenin
degradation (Figure 3F). Immunostaining in primary mouse spinal motor neurons validated these
observations, and further confirmed nuclear beta-catenin accumulation in UBQLN4D90A-expressing
cells (Figure 3G,H).
Inhibition of beta-catenin mitigates UBQLN4D90A variant-induced motor
axon morphogenic abnormalities
Given our findings that UBQLN4D90A expression results in reduced proteasomal efficiency and
nuclear beta-catenin accumulation, we asked if inhibition of beta-catenin could mitigate motor axon
morphogenesis defects characteristic of UBQLN4D90A expression. To address this possibility we uti-
lized quercetin, which acts by restricting beta-catenin nuclear localization to reduce beta-catenin-
dependent signaling (Park et al., 2005). Immunostaining for beta-catenin in mouse spinal motor
neurons transfected with UBQLN4-WT or UBQLN4D90A revealed significantly greater nuclear accu-
mulation of beta-catenin in UBQLN4D90A-expressing cells as compared to UBQLN4-WT-expressing
cells (Figure 4A,B). This accumulation was reduced by treatment with 0.1 mM quercetin, confirming
the inhibitor’s effectiveness. We next looked at quercetin’s effects on axon morphogenesis in pri-
mary neurons and in zebrafish in the context of UBQLN4-WT or UBQLN4D90A expression. Indeed,
the total number of neurites in 0.1 mM quercetin-treated UBQLN4D90A-expressing neurons was res-
cued to wild-type levels (Figure 4C,D). Moreover, the percentage of motor axons with aberrant
branching morphology in 50 mM quercetin-treated UBQLN4D90A-expressing zebrafish embryos was
significantly reduced as compared to vehicle-treated embryos (Figure 4E and F). Taken together,
these findings suggest that motor axon morphogenesis phenotypes characteristic of UBQLN4D90A
expression may result from beta-catenin accumulation, and that inhibition of beta-catenin is sufficient
to mitigate UBQLN4D90A variant-induced phenotypes.
Discussion
Here we provide the first evidence of UBQLN4 involvement in ALS, and reveal the association of
beta-catenin-dependent signaling with the disease variant-induced phenotypes. Taken with reports
of contributions by UBQLN1 and UBQLN2 to neurodegeneration, our findings suggest prominent
neuropathological involvement of the UBQLN gene family. In the present study, we identified abnor-
malities in spinal motor neuron morphogenesis in primary mouse neurons as well as a zebrafish
model in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the novel ALS-associated UBQLN4 variant
impaired UPS function, leading to increased beta-catenin in UBQLN4D90A-expressing cells. We also

 showed that inhibition of beta-catenin was sufficient to mitigate these phenotypes, suggesting a
role for beta-catenin signaling in regulating these physiological and pathological functions.
Ubiquilins are characterized by a ubiquitin-like UBL domain and a ubiquitin-associated UBA
domain that interact with proteasomes and polyubiquitinated substrates, respectively, to facilitate
proteasomal degradation (Ko et al., 2004). Because the D90A mutation lies near the UBL domain,
the UBQLN4D90A variant may compromise interaction with proteasomes, consistent with our finding
of proteasomal impairment in UBQLN4D90A-expressing neurons. Beta-catenin-dependent signaling
has been shown to play a critical role in regulating multiple aspects of neuronal development, includ-
ing neurite outgrowth (Votin et al., 2005), axon guidance (Avile
´s and Stoeckli, 2016; Maro et al.,
2009), and target innervation (Salinas and Zou, 2008; Wu et al., 2012). Therefore UBQLN4D90A
expression, which compromises UPS function and causes beta-catenin accumulation, may affect
motor neuron development through dysregulated beta-catenin-dependent signaling. Early neurode-
velopmental processes affect mature neuron functions; motor axon morphogenesis is essential for
action potential transmission and target innervation. Defects in these processes may therefore confer
functional vulnerability at later stages, rendering motor neurons susceptible to degeneration in ALS.
This is consistent with reports of aberrant motor axon morphology associated with ALS-related
genes including TDP-43 (Kabashi et al., 2010), SOD1 (Clark et al., 2016; Lemmens et al., 2007;
Ramesh et al., 2010) and C9orf72 (Burguete et al., 2015; Ciura et al., 2013).
Our observation that UBQLN4D90A expression impairs proteasome function (Figure 3A–D) sug-
gests that the variant acts in a dominant-negative manner. However, our finding that beta-catenin
level was still reduced in UBQLN4D90A expressing cells compared to nontransfected cells (Figure 3E,
F) suggests that the variant results in a partial loss-of-function. This may be because in the short
term UBQLN4D90A functions with reduced efficiency, but still facilitates degradation of substrates.
Overtime, reduced UBQLN4 functional efficiency may overload the proteasome pathway; therefore,
an initial partial loss of function can eventually lead to a dominant negative gain of function out-
come. This notion is consistent with the progressive nature of ALS.
It is notable that our findings link UBQLN4 with beta-catenin in the context of ALS, as recent
work suggested a similar role for beta-catenin signaling in the pediatric motor neuron disease Spinal
Muscular Atrophy (SMA) (Wishart et al., 2014). Wishart et al. reported similar morphological pheno-
types in UBA1-deficient zebrafish motor neurons in which beta-catenin expression was heightened,
and showed a dose-dependent rescue effect by quercetin. The degradation of beta-catenin is known
to be carried out through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway (Aberle et al., 1997). Disruption of
UBQLN4 or UBA1 function, which are both involved in the UPS pathway, could therefore lead to
beta-catenin accumulation and aberrant signaling. Given the wide-ranging and critical roles in neuro-
nal development and function played by beta-catenin, its upregulation in ALS and SMA may under-
standably have dire consequences for the development, function, and survival of affected motor
neurons. Collectively these studies suggest heightened beta-catenin activity as a common

 mechanism between the adult-onset motor neuron disease ALS and the pediatric motor neuron dis-
ease SMA.
Taken together, we revealed a novel role for UBQLN4 in regulating motor axon morphogenesis
through the UPS. Dysregulation of this function by the ALS-associated UBQLN4D90A variant leads to
compromised proteasome function and beta-catenin accumulation, conferring abnormalities in
motor axon morphogenesis (Figure 5), and contributing to motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Fur-
ther exploration of the underlying mechanism may provide new insights for understanding ALS path-
ogenesis and for therapeutic development.

validate the variant: these included 332 in-house controls, SNP databases with a total of >15,000
sequenced alleles, and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database with a total of 60,706
unrelated individuals (Lek et al., 2016).

Figure 5. Schematic model illustrating proposed roles for wild-type (A) and ALS-associated UBQLN4D90A (B) in motor axon morphogenesis. (A) Wild-
type UBQLN4 associates with beta-catenin through its UBA domain, and with the proteasome through its UBL domain. These interactions allow for the
degradation of beta-catenin, which in turn modulates gene expression to control motor axon morphogenesis. (B) The ALS-associated UBQLN4D90A
variant is deficient in mediating proteasomal degradation of beta-catenin, leading to its accumulation and excessive induction of gene expression.
Hyperactivation of beta-catenin-controlled genes dysregulates axon morphogenesis, causing aberrant axon branching in motor neurons.

 ZIRC_ZL1) were obtained from the Zebrafish International Resource Center (Eugene, OR) and main-
tained in standard conditions. Timed-pregnant wild-type CD1 mice (RRID:IMSR_CRL:086) were
obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Chicago, IL).
Constructs and cloning
A human UBQLN4 cDNA clone was obtained from GE Dharmacon (Clone ID: 6183942, Accession
#BU149502). The coding region was excised and 5’Fse1 and 3’Asc1 sites were inserted via PCR
(UBQLN4 FseFwd 5’ GATC GGC CGG CCT ACC ATG GCG GAG CCG AGC GGG GCC GAG 3’;
UBQLN4 AscRev 5’ GAT CGG CGC GCC TTA GGA GAG CTG GGA GCC CAG CAG 3’). The prod-
uct was ligated into a pCS2-Flag vector, and site-directed mutagenesis (Q5 kit, NEB) was performed
to convert the 2747 adenine to cytosine (UBQLN4 Q5 Fwd 5’ AAG GCT CAA GcT CCA GCT GCT G
3’; UBQLN4 Q5 Rev 5’ CTG AGG GGT CTT GAT GAC 3’). Both wild-type and mutant constructs
were verified by sequencing. UbG76V-GFP was a gift from Nico Dantuma (Addgene plasmid #11941).
mRNA microinjection in zebrafish
Capped mRNAs were generated from linearized UBQLN4 wild-type and mutant constructs via in
vitro transcription using the mMessage mMachine SP6 Transcription Kit (Ambion). Zebrafish embryos
were injected with capped mRNA (200–300 pg target) at the single-cell stage and grown until 32 hr
post-fertilization. Embryos were treated with quercetin (50 mM in 0.25% DMSO in embryo medium)
or vehicle control from six hours post-fertilization until fixation.
Cell culture and transfection
Primary mouse spinal cord motor neurons were isolated, dissociated, and cultured as described pre-
viously (Miller et al., 2015). The NSC-34 motor neuron cell line (RRID:CVCL_D356) was provided by
Dr. Neil Cashman (University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada; [Cashman et al., 1992]). The
NSC-34 line is not included in the International Cell Line Authentication Committee’s Database of
Cross-Contaminated or Misidentified Cell Lines, and is negative for mycoplasma. Primary and NSC-
34 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Cultures were fixed for imaging or lysed for Western blot analysis 48 hr post-transfec-
tion. For cycloheximide protein stability assay, cells were treated for 0, 2, 4, or 6 hr with 100 mg/ml
cycloheximide following UbG76V-GFP transfection. For quercetin treatment, a working concentration
of 0.1 mM was used.
Immunoblotting and staining
Western blotting was performed as described (Miller et al., 2015) with the following antibodies and
dilutions: mouse anti-beta-catenin (BD-Biosciences #610153, RRID:AB_397554; 1:500), goat anti-
beta-actin (Santa Cruz #1616, RRID:AB_630836; 1:1000), rabbit anti-GAPDH (Santa Cruz #25778,
RRID:AB_10167668; 1:1000), mouse anti-GFP (Affymetrix #14-6674-80, RRID:AB_2572899; 1:300),
and mouse anti-Flag M2 (Sigma #F3165, RRID:AB_259529, 1:1000). Whole-mount immunostaining of
zebrafish embryos was performed as follows: embryos were fixed overnight in 4% PFA at 4˚C. The
tissue was permeabilized with proteinase K (10 mg/ml) for 40 min and blocked with 5% BSA and 1%
goat serum in PBS for one hour. Embryos were incubated in primary antibody, mouse anti-znp1
(DSHB #znp - 1, RRID:AB_2315626; 1:500), in blocking solution overnight at 4˚C. Goat-anti-mouse
Cy3 secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, 1:250) diluted in blocking solution was applied
for one hour at room temperature. Immunostaining of cultured mouse neurons was performed as
described (Miller et al., 2015) with the following antibodies and dilutions: mouse anti-DDDDK tag
M2 (Abcam #ab45766, RRID:AB_731867; 1:1500), mouse anti-Isl1 (DSHB #40.2D6, RRID:AB_528315;
1:60), and mouse anti-beta-catenin (BD-Biosciences #610153, RRID:AB_397554; 1:300). All images
were acquired with the Zeiss 510 Meta Laser Scanning Microscope.
