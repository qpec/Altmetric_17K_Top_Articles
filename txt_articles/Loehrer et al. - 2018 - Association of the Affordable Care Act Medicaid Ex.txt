 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
2 
KEY POINTS 
 
Question: How did Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act affect patient 
presentation with and management of common surgical conditions? 
 
Findings: Among patients with one of 5 common surgical conditions, the Medicaid expansion 
was associated with a 7.5-percentage point increase in insurance coverage at the time of hospital 
admission. The policy was also associated with patients obtaining care earlier in their disease 
course and with an increased probability of receiving optimal care for those conditions. 
 
Meaning: The ACA’s Medicaid expansion was associated with increased coverage of patients, 
earlier presentation with common diagnoses, and improved surgical care. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
3 
ABSTRACT 
 
Importance: Lack of insurance coverage has been associated with delays in seeking care, more 
complicated diseases at the time of diagnosis, and decreased likelihood of receiving optimal 
surgical care. The Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) Medicaid expansion has increased coverage 
among millions of low-income Americans, but its impact on care for common surgical 
conditions remains unknown. 
 
Objective:  To evaluate the impact of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion on access to timely and 
recommended care for common and serious surgical conditions. 
 
Design: Quasi-experimental difference-in-differences study design, using hospital administrative 
data to compare patient-level outcomes in expansion vs. non-expansion states, before (2010-
2013) versus after (2014-2015) expansion. 
 
Setting: Academic medical centers and affiliated hospitals in 27 Medicaid expansion states and 
15 non-expansion states. 
 
Participants: Patients aged 18 to 64 years admitted to a study hospital between January 2010 
and September 2015 with appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, peripheral artery disease 
(PAD) or aortic aneurysm (N=293,529).   
 
Exposure(s): State adoption of Medicaid expansion 
 
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Presentation with early uncomplicated disease 
(diverticulitis without abscess, fistula, or sepsis; nonruptured aortic aneurysm at time of repair; 
and PAD without ulcerations or gangrene), and receipt of optimal management (cholecystectomy 
for acute cholecystitis; laparoscopic approach for cholecystectomy or appendectomy; limb-
salvage for PAD). 
 
Results: Medicaid expansion was associated with a 7.5 percentage-point decreased probability 
of patients being uninsured (95% CI -12.2 to -2.9; P=0.002) and an 8.6 percentage-point 
increased probability of having Medicaid (95% CI 6.1 to 11.1; P<0.001). Medicaid expansion 
was associated with a 1.8 percentage-point increase in the probability of early uncomplicated 
presentation (95% CI 0.7 to 2.9; P=0.001), and a 2.6 percentage-point increase in the probability 
of receiving optimal management (95% CI 0.8 to 4.4; P=0.006).  
 
Conclusions and Relevance: The ACA’s Medicaid expansion was associated with increased 
insurance coverage and improved receipt of timely care for five common surgical conditions.  
 
 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
4 
INTRODUCTION 
The Affordable Care Act (ACA) aimed to increase access to health care through expanded 
insurance coverage. Since enactment, more than 20 million individuals have gained health 
insurance through the ACA, disproportionately in states adopting Medicaid expansion.1,2 Survey-
based studies have shown the ACA to be associated with self-reported access to primary care and 
medications, affordability, and overall health.3-5 However, the clinical impact of coverage 
expansion on patients with common and serious surgical conditions remains unclear.  
 
Uninsured and underinsured patients are significantly more likely to delay care and present with 
more complicated disease for conditions including appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, 
aortic aneurysms and lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD).6-9 Insurance status is also 
associated with decreased probability of receiving optimal care for such diagnoses, including a 
lower likelihood of minimally invasive surgery, receiving immediate cholecystectomy for acute 
cholecystitis, and higher likelihood of amputation for vascular disease.6,7,10-12 The acute onset or 
deterioration of these diagnoses provides an ideal setting for studying short-term changes in 
presentation and management following population wide insurance coverage expansion. As more 
individuals gain insurance coverage, one might also expect a greater probability of patients 
presenting earlier and with less severe disease at time of diagnosis and in turn receive more 
timely and less morbid management. 
 
The 2006 Massachusetts health reform, a model for the ACA insurance expansions, was 
associated with an increased probability of presenting with less complicated surgical disease and 
a greater likelihood of receiving optimal surgical management after admission.13-15 However, it is 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care

unclear whether the Massachusetts experience generalizes to the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. 
Given current debate on the ACA and reforms to the Medicaid program, evidence on the impacts 
of these policies are critical. The primary objective of this study was to analyze changes 
associated with the ACA’s Medicaid expansion in access to and receipt of optimal care for 
common and serious surgical conditions.  
 
METHODS 
Study Design 
Our study uses a quasi-experimental difference-in-differences design to compare patient-level 
outcomes in Medicaid expansion vs. non-expansion states, before (2010-2013) versus after 
(2014-2015) expansion.  We also adjusted for potential time-varying confounders that could bias 
our estimates, and tested the underlying assumption of the study design – namely, that in the 
absence of the Medicaid expansion, our study outcomes would have had similar trends over time 
between expansion and non-expansion states. 
 
Data Source and Outcomes 
Our primary data source was the Vizient (formerly University HealthSystem Consortium) 
Clinical Database/Resource Manager (CD/RM).  The CD/RM is an administrative database 
capturing all discharges from participating hospitals that include over 95% of academic medical 
centers and affiliated hospitals across the country.  The database has been used in multiple 
previous analyses to study surgical care.16-19 Our analysis included admissions to 203 hospitals in 
27 Medicaid-expansion states (including Washington D.C) and 69 hospitals in 15 non-expansion 
states (Appendix Table 1).  Some hospitals enter and exit the sample during the study period; in 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
6 
sensitivity analyses, we tested the effect of this compositional change.  For confidentiality 
reasons, the public-use file does not include the specific state in which a hospital is located. For 
our analysis, we were provided with an indicator for whether a hospital was in a state that 
expanded Medicaid prior to September 2015.  
 
Our sample contained patients admitted to any hospital in the dataset between January 2010 and 
September 2015 with appendicitis, cholecystitis, diverticulitis, aortic aneurysm, or peripheral 
arterial disease (PAD).  Conditions were identified based on ICD-9 diagnosis and procedure 
codes (Appendix Table 2). We selected these particular surgical conditions given extensive 
documentation of disparities in patient presentation with and subsequent care received based on 
insurance coverage, in addition to data suggesting an association between insurance expansion 
and care delivery for these conditions.5-14 Surgery for appendicitis, cholecystitis, and 
diverticulitis represent the three most frequent and highest morbidity procedures in general 
surgery.20 Vascular diseases, including aortic aneurysm and PAD, are increasingly prevalent in 
the U.S., and timely appropriate management has been shown to directly impact both mortality 
and major morbidity.21,22 
 
We limited our sample to patients whose age was between 19 and 64 years. Adults older than 64 
years and those with Medicare coverage were excluded, as they were not eligible for the ACA’s 
Medicaid expansion. Although the majority of newly insured patients under the ACA have 
enrolled in Medicaid, our primary analysis also included those with private insurance, since 
Medicaid expansion may have affected transitions in coverage between private and public 
insurance, and possible enrollment in ACA Marketplace plans. Unable to specifically determine 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
7 
which individuals gained Medicaid after expansion, we conducted a subgroup analysis, 
stratifying our sample into 1) those with private coverage and 2) those with Medicaid or no 
health insurance.  If the ACA’s Medicaid expansion is causing the changes we observe, they 
should be concentrated among the latter group (Medicaid/uninsured). 
 
Our study outcomes were composite measures in two broad domains – “early uncomplicated 
presentation,” and “receipt of optimal care.”  These composite outcomes were created to include 
a variety of common, serious surgical diseases that share a common causal pathway associated 
with similar outcomes, and to increase power to detect significant effects across multiple 
conditions.  For early, uncomplicated presentation, we defined the condition-specific outcomes 
as follows: uncomplicated diverticulitis as the absence of peritoneal or retroperitoneal abscess, 
enterocutaneous fistula, sepsis or septic shock; non-ruptured aortic aneurysm at the time of 
repair; and peripheral artery disease without ulcerations or gangrene of limb (see Appendix 
Table 3 for details of ICD-9 codes used in this definition).  
 
We defined “optimal care” for select diagnoses based on prior studies showing improved 
morbidity, mortality, effect on quality of life, and costs.23-28 Condition-specific outcomes were as 
follows: receipt of cholecystectomy when admitted with acute cholecystitis; receipt of 
minimally-invasive appendectomy or cholecystectomy when undergoing surgery for acute 
appendicitis or cholecystitis; and avoidance of amputation when admitted with lower extremity 
peripheral artery disease. While alternative treatment may be appropriate for individual patients 
depending on specific presentation, we contend that receipt of optimal care as defined here 
represents the ideal management if patients present early and are healthy enough to receive it.

Statistical Analysis 
We used linear regression difference-in-difference models to evaluate changes in presentation 
and management of surgical conditions for patients in expansion states versus non-expansion 
states associated with implementation of the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.  Linear models provide 
straightforward estimates of absolute changes, as is typical in difference-in-differences models.29 
An “Expansion State” binary variable was created for discharges from hospitals in states that 
expanded Medicaid eligibility any time before September 2015. A separate “Post-Reform” 
indicator variable was created if the discharge occurred on or after January 1, 2014, the date 
expanded Medicaid eligibility in the majority of adopting states. An interaction term was created 
between Expansion State and Post-Reform, which provides the difference-in-differences estimate 
for the Medicaid expansion.  
 
All models adjusted for patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, and comorbidity, in addition to a linear 
quarterly time trend. The CD/RM defines categorical age variables as “18-30 years”, “31-50 
years”, or “51-64 years.” Patient race/ethnicity was defined in the dataset as “White”, “Black”, 
“Asian”, or “other.” Patient comorbidity was determined using the Charlson Comorbidity 
Index.30 Standard errors were clustered at the hospital level using cluster-correlated robust 
estimate of variance, as the public use file does not allow the direct identification of states.31 
 
In sensitivity analyses, we assessed parallel trends in outcomes between expansion and non-
expansion states prior to 2014, which is the key to the validity of the difference-in-differences 
study design. These models included only admissions that occurred prior to January 1, 2014. An 
interaction term between the Expansion state variable and the continuous quarter variable was 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
9 
used to identify differential trends in outcomes between expansion state and non-expansion states 
prior to 2014. Additionally, we broke down our composite outcomes to assess trends in 
presentation with and management of individual diagnoses, though with reduced power due to 
smaller sample sizes.  Finally, additional sensitivity models limited analysis to 139 hospitals in 
expansion states and 44 hospitals in non-expansion states that were consistently represented in 
the dataset from 2010 through 2015.  
 
This study was deemed exempt from IRB review by Harvard University, since we only 
examined de-identified data. Data were analyzed using STATA software, version 14 (STATA, 
College Station, TX). Statistical significance was tested using a two-sided threshold of p=0.05. 
 
RESULTS 
Our final sample included 225,572 admissions in Medicaid expansion states and 67,957 
admissions in non-expansion states. Patient demographic and clinical characteristics are shown 
in Table 1. Patients in expansion states were younger, more likely to be white, and a higher share 
had private insurance.  Patient sex and comorbidity were comparable between expansion and 
non-expansion states.  
 
Beginning in 2014, the share of uninsured patients dropped sharply in expansion states compared 
to non-expansion states (Figure 1).  In adjusted models, the Medicaid expansion was associated 
with a 7.5 percentage-point decrease in the probability of being uninsured (95% CI -12.2 to -2.9; 
P=0.002) and an 8.6 percentage-point increase in the probability of Medicaid coverage (95% CI 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
10 
6.1 to 11.1; P<0.001) in our sample of admissions for surgical conditions (Table 2). There was 
no significant change in the probability of admissions for patients with private insurance. 
 
Figure 2 shows unadjusted trends in presentation and management throughout study period, and 
Table 3 presents adjusted difference-in-differences estimates of changes in patient presentation 
and management associated with Medicaid expansion.  Medicaid expansion was associated with 
a 1.8 percentage-point increased probability (95% CI 0.7 to 2.9; P=0.001) of early uncomplicated 
presentation for all patients. Improvements in presentation were concentrated among the 
Medicaid/uninsured subgroup (2.9 percentage points, 95% CI 1.2 to 4.8; P=0.001). Medicaid 
expansion was associated with a 2.6 percentage-point increased probability of optimal care (95% 
CI 0.8 to 4.4; P=0.006) among all patients, and this estimate rose to 3.7 percentage points (95% 
CI 0.7 to 6.7; P=0.016) in the Medicaid/uninsured subgroup.  Unadjusted trends in Figure 2 
shows an apparent divergence in in timely presentation beginning in 2013. However, adjusted 
models comparing pre-expansion trends in expansion and non-expansion states did not show any 
significant differences for either of the composite surgical measures (Appendix Table 4), 
offering support for the difference-in-differences design. 
 
Evaluating individual components of our composite measures produced similar directional 
estimates for the impact of the Medicaid expansion, but with variable statistical significance 
(Appendix Tables 5 and 6).  Early presentation for diverticulitis remained significant (p=0.004), 
as did optimal management of acute cholecystitis (p=0.05), while the remaining outcomes had 
positive but non-significant coefficients. Results were also consistent when limiting analyses to 
patients admitted to hospitals present in sample throughout study period (Appendix Table 7).

Finally, given that our outcomes are calculated as a proportion of total admissions, we assessed 
whether admission rates for these conditions changed in association with Medicaid expansion 
(Appendix Table 8).  In our full sample, there were no differential changes in admission rates for 
these conditions in expansion states compared to non-expansion states (Incident Rate Ratio 
[IRR] 0.99; 95% CI 0.97 to 1.00; P=0.14).  Among the insurance subgroups, we detect 
significant but small changes – a slight increase in volume of admissions for Medicaid/uninsured 
(IRR 1.02, p<0.001) in expansion vs. non-expansion states, and a slight decrease for privately 
insured patients (IRR 0.99, P<0.001).  This indicates that the changes in our composite outcomes 
(Figure 2 and Table 3) are primarily due to changes in the numerator (i.e. early presentation and 
optimal care received), rather than the denominator (i.e. number of admissions). 
 
DISCUSSION 
In a study of over 290,000 hospital admissions in 42 states (including Washington DC), we find 
that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion was associated with significant increases in insurance 
coverage among patients presenting with serious surgical conditions. The Medicaid expansion 
was also associated with a significantly greater likelihood of patients’ presenting with earlier less 
complicated disease at the time of admission, and an increased likelihood of receiving optimal 
care after admission. As expected, these changes were concentrated among Medicaid and 
uninsured patients most likely to benefit from coverage expansion, rather than those with private 
insurance.  To our knowledge, this is among the first non-survey based data indicating 
improvements in quality of care associated with the ACA’s Medicaid expansion.  Our findings 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
12 
supplement a large body of research demonstrating improved access, satisfaction with care, and 
self-reported health since enactment of the ACA.3,4,32,33 
 
The ACA expanded insurance coverage to over 20 million Americans, largely through Medicaid, 
and one main goal of the law was to decrease barriers to timely receipt of high-quality care for 
serious medical conditions.2  Our study focuses on common surgical conditions for several 
reasons: they are typically urgent conditions requiring prompt evaluation; delays in care may 
respond quickly to changes in health insurance status; and they are highly costly and morbid 
conditions.  Thus, our study captures outcomes with important implications for both public 
health and health care costs.  Beyond financial protection for individual patients, Medicaid 
expansion has been shown to mitigate uncompensated care and improve finances for hospitals 
caring for vulnerable populations.34,35 These data also build on previous works from 
Massachusetts and the ACA’s dependent coverage provision showing an association between 
insurance expansion and improved clinical care of acute onset diseases, including appendicitis, 
cholecystitis and lower extremity vascular disease.13-15,36  
 
Our findings are likely explained by several main factors. Newly insured individuals may be less 
likely to delay seeking care and thus present sooner when early symptoms develop. Such 
behavior is consistent with the Oregon health insurance experiment and numerous ACA-related 
studies that show Medicaid coverage to be associated with decreased delays in seeking care and 
increased use of emergency room, primary care, and outpatient clinics.4,5,37  Having presented 
earlier in the clinical progression or deterioration of their conditions, patients may be more likely 
to receive optimal management with decreased morbidity and improved outcomes.  Additionally, 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
13 
hospitals may be more willing to provide care for newly-insured individuals who previously 
lacked coverage.38 As expected for the conditions studied, our analysis found no significant 
change in the overall number of individuals treated, but rather change the timeliness in which 
individuals receive care. 
 
The study also has a number of limitations that should be considered. First, the CD/RM is an 
administrative dataset and as such is vulnerable to coding errors and limited clinical granularity 
captured through ICD-9 coding. However, these data have been used extensively for hospital 
quality benchmarking, including studies of the diagnoses used in our analyses, and it has been 
shown to be valid in comparison with clinical data and large administrative datasets.16-19 The 
CD/RM also only includes participating academic medical centers and affiliated hospitals that 
may differ in important ways from non-academic hospitals.  Yet, academic centers play a key 
role in the health care safety net, making them highly relevant to evaluating the effects of the 
Medicaid expansion. Furthermore, our analysis included over 203 hospitals in 42 states 
(including Washington DC), capturing a fairly broad segment of inpatient care in the U.S. 
Recognizing these limitations, we feel the advantages of the CD/RM dataset outweigh many of 
these concerns and enable a robust, timely analysis of clinical outcomes with a validated data 
source. 
 
While our analysis presents strong evidence that the expansion led to increases in insurance 
coverage, we recognize that the data on improved quality of care is not as clear. Our use of 
composite outcomes has specific limitations. Evaluation of individual components (Appendix 
Table 6 and 7) reveals varying patterns of change after expansion, some components with 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
14 
marked improvement in expansion states after expansion and others with less of a decline after 
expansion. Despite this heterogeneity, the overall changes and pattern are consistent with 
improved care for each component in expansion states compared to changes in non-expansion 
states. Furthermore, Medicaid/uninsured patients saw the majority of improved outcomes in 
expansion states compared to privately insured patients (Table 3). Privately insured patients 
within expansion states may serve as an additional within-state control group to assess for 
regional differences independent of insurance expansion, although they are not truly a control 
group given the ACA’s numerous policies affecting this population. 
 
Additionally, we defined post-reform period as any discharge after January 1, 2014. Although 
five states partially expanded Medicaid prior to 2014 and another seven states expanded after 
2014, the insurance coverage trends seen in our dataset saw the most marked shift starting in 
2014.  Limitations on state identifiers in our dataset prevented additional sensitivity testing 
through including or excluding these states from analysis.  However, the early expansion states 
may have contributed to a trend toward a decreasing uninsured rate in expansion states prior to 
2014. Analysis of our sample revealed an increase in the percentage of surgical patients who 
were uninsured in nonexpansion states after 2014 (Table 2). This could partly explain the 
worsening of outcomes after 2014 while expansion states saw stabilization or improvement. 
 
Our findings also may not be generalizable for other medical conditions. We selected these 
diagnoses and procedures based on well-established disparities in presentation and management 
based on insurance coverage.6-11 Underlying pathophysiology or comorbidities, rather than 
delays in care, may contribute to severity of disease at presentation and subsequent 
 Affordable Care Act Medicaid Expansion and Access to Surgical Care 
15 
management.39,40 Compared to states that expanded Medicaid, nonexpansion states are known to 
have higher rates of comorbid conditions including obesity and cardiovascular disease which 
may limit generalizability.41-43 However, these differences between states should not bias our 
difference-in-differences analysis unless they were changing significantly during the study 
period; stable differences between states are filtered out with our study design.  
 
Finally, additional changes in care delivery both associated with and independent of the ACA 
could have potentially influenced our findings. As these data do not enable the evaluation of 
hospital- or state-specific programs of redesigned care, ongoing assessment of alternative 
payment and delivery models is needed to ensure changes are equitable across populations. 
 
Conclusions 
In this study of surgery patients in 42 states (including Washington DC), we found that the 
ACA’s Medicaid expansion was associated with higher coverage rates, earlier presentation, and 
improved probability of optimal care for common and serious surgical conditions. Our data 
reinforce that insurance coverage is an important contributor to earlier presentation with less 
severe disease at time of diagnosis.  As policy makers weigh changes to or a potential repeal of 
the Affordable Care Act, these findings provide important new data on the early clinical impacts 
of the law’s coverage expansion.
