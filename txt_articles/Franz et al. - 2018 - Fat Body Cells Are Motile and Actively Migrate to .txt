In Brief
Adipocytes and their fly equivalent, fat
body cells, have been considered
immotile, but Franz et al. now show the
latter can actively migrate to wounds
using a peristaltic-like ‘‘swimming’’
motility. Once there, they multitask to
clear wound cell debris, plug the epithelial
gap, and upregulate AMPs to prevent
infection.

SUMMARY
Adipocytes have many functions in various tissues
beyond energy storage, including regulating meta-
bolism, growth, and immunity. However, little is
known about their role in wound healing. Here we
use live imaging of fat body cells, the equivalent of
vertebrate adipocytes in Drosophila, to investigate
their potential behaviors and functions following
skin wounding. We find that pupal fat body cells are
not immotile, as previously presumed, but actively
migrate to wounds using an unusual adhesion-inde-
pendent, actomyosin-driven, peristaltic mode of
motility. Once at the wound, fat body cells collabo-
rate with hemocytes, Drosophila macrophages, to
clear the wound of cell debris; they also tightly seal
the epithelial wound gap and locally release antimi-
crobial peptides to fight wound infection. Thus, fat
body cells are motile cells, enabling them to migrate
to wounds to undertake several local functions
needed to drive wound repair and prevent infections.
INTRODUCTION
There is a growing realization that adipocytes, once believed to
act merely as local reservoirs of energy and to provide mechan-
ical and thermal insulation, also have numerous other roles in
various tissues in health and disease. These range from systemic
metabolic and immune regulation through to key functions in tis-
sue development and cancer progression (Hepler et al., 2017;
Hoy et al., 2017; Maurizi et al., 2017; Rivera-Gonzalez et al.,
2014). In the context of skin, there is a clear link between initial
seeding of adipocyte precursors and subsequent dermal differ-
entiation and hair follicle growth (Rivera-Gonzalez et al., 2014).
However, rather little is known about the potential function of ad-
ipocytes in tissue repair. After skin wounding myofibroblasts
have been shown to transdifferentiate into adipocytes (Plikus
et al., 2017). Furthermore, adipocyte precursor cells are known
to differentiate into mature adipocytes and these appear to
contribute to repair because blocking their differentiation leads
to defects in fibroblast migration and matrix deposition (Schmidt
and Horsley, 2013). Other known functions of adipocytes include
antimicrobial activities, since Staphylococcus aureus infection
of otherwise healthy skin leads to rapid proliferation of dermal
adipocytes, and impaired adipogenesis results in increased
skin infections (Zhang et al., 2015).
The Drosophila fat body is considered to be equivalent to both
the vertebrate adipocytes and liver, and is known to play many
diverse systemic roles throughout all insect life stages. It regu-
lates metabolism by actively sensing nutritional conditions and
accordingly storing or releasing energy in the form of lipids,
glycogen, and protein (Beller et al., 2010; Bi et al., 2012; Gro
¨ nke
et al., 2005, 2007). Importantly, fat storage in intracellular lipid
droplets, and the mechanisms and key components responsible
for stored-fat mobilization in the Drosophila fat body and
mammalian adipocytes, appear to be evolutionarily conserved
(Gro
¨ nke et al., 2007). In addition to storing energy, the fat body
also plays a central role in regulating systemic growth in
response to nutrition. Upon sensing dietary amino acids, the
fat body secretes several humoral factors, which control sys-
temic growth of the animal (Britton and Edgar, 1998; Colombani
et al., 2003; Delanoue et al., 2016; Ge
´ minard et al., 2009; Sousa-
Nunes et al., 2011). This is achieved, in part, by the regulated
secretion of insulin-like peptides by the insulin-producing cells
of the brain (Ge
´ minard et al., 2009). Furthermore, the fat body
is known also to play a crucial role in systemic immunity. Bacte-
rial and fungal infections activate the Toll and IMD pathways in
the fat body, resulting in the systemic expression and secretion
of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), including Attacin (Bu-
chon et al., 2014; Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007).
While major efforts have been made over the last few decades
to elucidate the roles of the fat body in regulating metabolism,
growth, and immunity, its potential role in wound repair has not
been studied to date. Using live imaging of pupal epithelial
wounds we show for the first time that pupal fat body cells
(FBCs) are motile cells that actively migrate to wounds. We
find that these giant cells move through the hemolymph toward
the wound using an adhesion-independent, actomyosin-driven,
peristaltic mode of motility. Once they have reached the wound,

 FBCs assist hemocytes in clearing the wound of cell debris as
well as sealing the epithelial wound gap and locally releasing
AMPs to repair the wound and fight infection.
RESULTS
FBCs Are Motile and Migrate toward Wounds
To investigate the potential functions of FBCs during wound
healing, we first studied their location and potential behaviors
following tissue injury in pupae, since this developmental stage
has proven ideal for live imaging of other wound healing events
(Antunes et al., 2013; Weavers et al., 2016b). We found that
16-hr-old pupae contain large numbers of giant polyploid, disso-
ciated FBCs that populate the body cavity (Figure 1A). To study
the behaviors of FBCs following tissue injury by live imaging, we
used a laser to induce small epithelial wounds in the ventral tho-
rax of pupae, an area sparsely populated by FBCs (Movie S1).
Nuclei were labeled with Histone-red fluorescent protein (RFP;
bright red, condensed nuclei mark damaged epithelial cells in
the wound area, while dimmer red nuclei mark the surrounding
healthy epithelial cells; Figure S1) and FBCs were labeled with
GFP (Figures 1B and 1C). Strikingly, we found that FBCs, previ-
ously thought to be immotile, were actually highly dynamic, and
migrated rapidly toward wounds. Once at the wound site these
cells remained tightly associated with the wound until closure,
when they detached and actively migrated away (Figures 1B
and 1C; Movie S2, first movie). When we compared small, me-
dium, and large wounds (30–60, 60–90, and 90–120 mm in diam-
eter, respectively; Figures 1D–1F; Movie S2, second, third, and
fourth movies), we found that the frequency of FBC recruitment
to wounds (Figure 1G), as well as the number of wound-associ-
ated FBCs (Figure 1H), positively correlated with the size of the
wound: for small wounds, a single FBC generally plugged the
wound, whereas in larger wounds up to 5 FBCs approached
and associated with the wounded area (Figures 1D–1F, 1H,
and Movie S2). The time of FBC arrival at the wound was vari-
able, depending on their initial distance from the wound; some
FBCs arrived after 10 min, with the average arrival time being
around 1 hr after wounding, irrespective of wound size (Figure 1I).
Once FBCs started contacting the wound area, they usually re-
mained associated until reepithelialization was complete, result-
ing in a longer period of FBC-wound association in larger
wounds with longer closure times (Figure 1I).
FBCs Migrate to Wounds with Directional Persistence
To test whether the recruitment of FBCs to wounds was driven
by true directed migration and not just a random walk or passive
fluid flow, we tracked individual cells in wounded and un-
wounded pupae (Figure 2A) and measured the directional persis-
tence of the resulting tracks. Further analysis of these tracks
showed an increase in the meandering index and a decrease in
the angle of migration, together suggesting that wound-recruited
FBCs responded to the wounds with high directional persistence
(Figures 2B and 2C). The movement of FBCs to wounds is not
due to passive flow of hemolymph toward the wound; this pos-
sibility has previously been ruled out by bead-tracking experi-
ments following epithelial wounding in pupae where we saw no
such flow (Weavers et al., 2016b). Moreover, we see no hemo-
lymph leakage from wounds since laser wounding generally re-
sults in cuticular holes of <0.5 mm in diameter (Figure S1D).
Next, we measured the speed of FBCs and found that they did
not accelerate toward the wound; their meandering index was
increased but their speed remained the same as in unwounded
pupae until they reached the wound, when they decelerated
and stopped (Figure 2D and Movie S2, first movie). Once the
wound became fully occupied by one or more FBCs, late-arriving
cells appeared unable to gain direct access because this
space was occupied by earlier-arriving FBCs, but they often re-
mained in the vicinity and circulated at the periphery (Movie S2,
first movie; Figure S2A). Interestingly, both wound-recruited
and late-arriving FBCs initially showed an increase in their
meandering index (Figure S2B), suggesting that both cell popu-
lations respond equally to wound attractants.
FBC Migration Is Achieved via an Actomyosin-Driven
‘‘Peristaltic’’ Swimming Motion
Given our observation that Drosophila FBCs can actively
migrate, we used live imaging of the actin cytoskeleton to under-
stand the mechanism by which these cells power their migration.
Most cells, whether in tissue culture or in vivo within tissues,
migrate by adhering to, and crawling over, a substratum, often
using actin-rich lamellipodia at their leading edges. By contrast,
FBCs are not adherent to any epithelial surface; rather, they
reside within the hemolymph (Figure 1A and Movie S1). To our
surprise, live imaging of FBCs expressing GMA (GFP fused to
the actin-binding domain of moesin) revealed that these cells
were constantly undergoing actin-based contractile waves that
initiated from the cortex of the cell center and extended to the
rear of the cell, propelling them in the opposite direction (i.e., for-
ward) in a peristaltic fashion. These waves occurred constantly
within FBCs in unwounded pupae (Figure 3A; Movie S3, first
movie) but upon wounding became highly directed with respect
to the wound (Figures 3B and 3C; Movie S3, second movie). Us-
ing markers of the actin regulatory proteins, Fimbrin, Ena, and
Fascin, we saw no sign of the more standard lamellipodial struc-
tures, observed for example in Drosophila macrophages (hemo-
cytes), as they migrate to wounds (Stramer et al., 2005), as FBCs
‘‘swam’’ toward the wound (Movies S4 and S5). However, once
they had reached the wound, FBCs started to form lamellipodia
that extended around the wound margin (Movies S4 and S5).
In order to test whether motility of FBCs is indeed actomyosin
driven, we expressed a dominant-negative version of Zipper
(Myosin II heavy chain) tagged with YFP specifically in FBCs.
During early pupal development, FBCs normally undergo an
extensive remodeling, characterized by the dissociation of the
fat body into single cells followed by their redistribution in the
body cavity. This redistribution leads to the translocation of
some cells into the anterior head capsule, which has previously
been suggested to be driven by abdominal muscular contrac-
tions (Bond et al., 2011; Cherbas et al., 2003). Interestingly, we
found that expression of dominant-negative Zipper-YFP only in
FBCs led to a complete failure in FBC redistribution within the
body cavity and translocation into the head (Figure 3D). More-
over, when we imaged and tracked these cells in the dorsal
abdomen we found that their general motility was strongly
reduced (Figures 3E and 3F; Movie S6). This suggests that the
developmental process of FBC redistribution and translocation
in pupae is not driven passively by muscular body contractions

461
 but is instead an active process driven by actomyosin-depen-
dent migration of FBCs. Similarly, expression of dominant-nega-
tive Zipper in FBCs completely blocked their ability to migrate
to wounds in the ventral thorax (0% recruitment of FBCs to
wounds, n = 72 wounds). Together, these data suggest that pu-
pal FBCs are indeed motile cells, which migrate using an adhe-
sion-independent, actomysin-driven peristaltic mode of motility
during both their developmental dispersal and their recruitment
to wounds.

 in embryos and pupae (Stramer et al., 2005; Weavers et al.,
2016b), much as innate immune cells are drawn to wounds in
vertebrates (Eming et al., 2017). Interestingly, larval hemocytes
have been shown to collaborate with and even communicate
with FBCs through cytokine release in response to bacterial in-
fections, leading to a scenario whereby hemocytes phagocytose
bacteria while FBCs produce AMPs systemically, but these AMP
levels are significantly reduced in the absence of hemocytes
(Shia et al., 2009). To investigate whether hemocytes and
FBCs interact with one another during wound healing, we
wounded pupae in which both hemocytes and FBCs were
labeled with cytosolic GFP and nuclear RFP. Both cell types
migrated at approximately the same speed, 2.5–3.5 mm/min
(Movie S7; Figures 4A and 2D; Stramer et al., 2005), although
in general, due to their proximity to the wound and increased
numbers, hemocytes often arrived before FBCs (Figure 4A).
We see the same if these two lineages are labeled with comple-
mentary cytosolic GFP and mCherry tags (Figure S3 and
Movie S8). Interestingly, most hemocytes were swept aside as
the first FBC approached the wound (Movies S7 and S8). To
test whether FBC recruitment might be dependent on the pres-
ence of hemocytes at the wound, we genetically ablated hemo-
cytes through lineage-specific expression of apoptosis-inducing
Reaper for 16 hr before wounding. This loss of hemocytes did not
significantly alter the frequency of FBC recruitment to wounds
(70% and 60% of wounds with or without hemocyte ablation,
n = 11 and 9, respectively; Figures 4B and 4C; Movie S9), sug-
gesting that FBCs are not drawn to wounds by attractant signals
released by hemocytes.
Given our finding that FBCs are motile and rapidly migrate to
wounds, next we wanted to investigate what local functions
they might play during wound healing. Efficient wound repair re-
quires the clearance of wound debris from the wound site, which
is known to be, in part, orchestrated by hemocytes through
phagocytosis (Weavers et al., 2016a). Interestingly, we noticed
that, when we ablated hemocytes, the majority of cellular debris
at the wound (visualized as bright Histone-RFP-labeled nuclei of
damaged epithelial cells) was swept aside by the incoming FBCs
(Figures 4B and 4C; Movie S9). In the presence of hemocytes,
this clearance of cell debris away from the wound site by FBCs
also occurred, albeit to a lesser extent, and was accompanied
by engulfment of the debris by hemocytes (Movie S2). We also
observed phagocytic cup formation and subsequent engulfment
of debris at the wound site by FBCs in 35% of small and 75% of
large wounds, which contained wound-recruited FBCs (n = 17
and 12, respectively, Figure 4D). Thus FBCs, in concert with he-
mocytes, appear to play an important local function in clearing
cell debris during wound repair: FBCs physically clear the wound

hemocytes, and to a lesser extent FBCs, take up the debris by
phagocytosis (Figure 4E).
FBCs Multitask at the Wound Site to Both Seal the Gap
and Produce AMPs to Stave Off Infection
Next, we wanted to investigate whether, in addition to wound
repair, FBCs might play local functions in fighting wound infec-
tion. Given the large size of FBCs and their apparent tight asso-
ciation with the wound throughout closure, we wondered
whether they might play a role in plugging the wound to prevent
entrance of pathogens and leakage of tissue fluids, much as a
clot in a vertebrate wound. Light and transmission electron mi-
croscopy revealed an extremely tight seal between wound-asso-
ciated FBCs and the epithelial wound margin (Figures 5A–5C;

 which would be too small for bacteria to pass through. In order to
understand how these cells are able to achieve such a tight as-
sociation, we again turned to live imaging of the actin dynamics
within these cells as they arrive at the wound site. Expressing flu-
orescently tagged forms of the actin regulatory proteins Fascin,
Fimbrin, and Ena revealed that, although FBCs moved to the
wound without the use of lamellipodia or blebbing, once at the
wound site, all co-operating cells extended lamellipodial protru-
sions from their apical surfaces that reached around and out of
the wound margin, to form a tight seal (Figure 5D; Movies S4
and S5). These dynamic lamellipodia remained in a ring forma-
tion around the closing wound edge, sealing off the wound
from the body cavity of the animal until reepithelialization was
complete. Throughout this period, FBCs within the vicinity of
the wound produced extensive blebs as if jostling to become
more firmly wedged into the wound gap and form an effective
plug (Figure 5E; Movie S2, second movie). Interestingly, this
plugging of the wound may come with some cost; since express-
ing dominant-negative Zipper specifically in FBCs to prevent
their recruitment to wounds (see earlier) resulted in significantly
faster wound reepithelialization (Figure S4). This suggests that
the presence of FBCs at the wound site may partially physically
obstruct epithelial closure.
Drosophila FBCs have been shown to systemically produce a
variety of AMPs following infection with a variety of pathogens
(Buchon et al., 2014; Lemaitre and Hoffmann, 2007). We
wondered whether, since wounding is generally associated
with infection, local delivery of AMPs to the wound might be
another function of FBCs recruited to wounds. To test this, we
wounded pupae expressing a reporter of one of these AMPs,
Attacin, and then briefly added RFP-labeled Escherichia coli to
the wound prior to live imaging. Our laser wounding usually
only results in a very small hole in the cuticle of <0.5 mm in diam-
eter (Figure S1D) and so bacteria generally fail to enter the wound
but their pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) can
(schematic in Figure 5F and data not shown). Wounding in the
absence of an infection did not induce an upregulation of Attacin
in FBCs. In contrast with this, within 60–90 min of making an in-
fected wound, we saw an upregulation of Attacin in a few epithe-
lial cells near the wound, as well as in the FBCs that plugged the
wound and those in close proximity, up to 50 mm away (Figure 5F
and Movie S10). This was clearly a local response by the FBCs
since it did not occur in FBCs distant from the wound (Figure 5F).
This shows that, following wound infection, FBCs are able to
detect bacteria at the epithelial breach and locally deliver
AMPs. Thus, FBCs, together with hemocytes, appear to play
important local functions in combating wound infection: FBCs
plug the wound gap, thereby forming a barrier that might prevent
entry of bacteria and locally deliver AMPs to fight off pathogens,
while hemocytes clear bacteria by phagocytosis.
DISCUSSION
Our data show that FBCs, Drosophila adipocytes, are recruited
to wounds in pupae where they have multiple local roles in
wound healing. The observation that FBCs are motile cells that
actively migrate to wounds is unexpected and has not previously
been made for adipocytes in any other organism. However, our
findings raise the interesting question as to whether vertebrate
adipocytes might also have the capacity to migrate. In that re-
gard, a recent mammalian wound study found that adipocytes
repopulate murine wounds, and suggested that some may
have migrated from distant sites (Schmidt and Horsley, 2013).
It will be fascinating to discover whether some sub-populations
of vertebrate adipocytes are indeed motile and whether they
utilize similar migratory strategies to those highlighted in
Drosophila FBCs.
The mode of motility we observe for FBCs moving through the
hemolymph to wounds is unusual, since it does not appear to
involve the use of standard lamellipodia or blebs, utilized by
most known migrating cells as they crawl in an adhesion-depen-
dent fashion over substrates and through a milieu of extracellular
matrix. Adhesion-independent migration has recently emerged
as an alternative migration mode that has now been described
for several other types of cells, including ameba, lymphocytes,
and some cancer cells (Paluch et al., 2016). Four models have
been proposed for adhesion-independent migration: force trans-
mission driven by ‘‘chimneying’’ between two opposing sub-
strate faces, the intercalation of lateral cell protrusions with
gaps in the substrate, non-specific friction between cell and sub-
strate, and swimming by noncyclic cell shape deformations (Pal-
uch et al., 2016). Only the last of these is entirely independent of
any interactions with (or close proximity to) a solid substrate and
hence best describes our observation of the migration of FBCs
through hemolymph to wounds, since we do not see significant
interactions of these cells with any substrate or other cells as
they migrate. Similar to FBCs, several other cell types have
been reported to migrate by swimming, when they are required
to move through viscous fluid: amebae and neutrophils have
been shown to swim when in viscous solution (Barry and
Bretscher, 2010) and lymphocytes are known to migrate using
contraction waves when in suspension (Haston and Shields,
1984). However, the exact mechanism by which these swimming
cells generate internal forces and how these forces are trans-
duced to the extracellular environment to generate forward
movement is still unknown. A recent study has shed some light
on how internal forces are generated during another type of
adhesion-independent migration; it showed that the migration
of Walker carcinoma cells in confinement is driven by cyclical
rearward flow of cortical actin that is coupled to the substrate
through friction. This migration depends on the contractility of
cortical actin at the rear of the cells (Bergert et al., 2015). More-
over, rearward flow of cortical actin has also been described for
the oscillatory behavior of detached cells and cell fragments
(Paluch et al., 2005), as well as for the stable-bleb cell migration
of zebrafish germ layer progenitor cells (Ruprecht et al., 2015).
This is strikingly similar to the rearward peristaltic actin waves
we observe in FBCs migrating to wounds, suggesting that this
could be the mechanism of force generation in FBCs also.
However, it still remains unclear how such an intracellular force
might be transduced to the extracellular environment to drive for-
ward movement of FBCs. It has previously been presumed that,
while swimming works for large multicellular organisms, it cannot
operate at the microscopic cell level, where viscous forces are
many orders of magnitude higher than inertial forces (i.e., at
low Reynold’s number; Purcell, 1977) and hence geometrically
reciprocal cell shape changes may not generate propulsive
forces (Paluch et al., 2016). However, this view has been

 challenged and may only be true for simple Newtonian fluids, like
water (Qiu et al., 2014), which the hemolymph that FBCs swim
through is clearly not. Moreover, swimming in a non-Newtonian
fluid is thought to be possible if the cell shape changes of
migrating cells are nonreciprocal, which might be true for FBCs
migrating to wounds. It is also possible that FBCs, in addition
to swimming, make use of other mechanisms to migrate. The
hemolymph is relatively densely packed with cells including
hemocytes and other FBCs (see Figure 1A), and FBCs are adja-
cent to the epithelium and muscle, depending on the location in
the body. Although we have not observed contacts, it is possible
that the close proximity of FBCs with other cells and tissues en
route to a wound might enable them to occasionally generate
additional frictional forces like the ones reported for non-
adherent Walker cells migrating in a confined microfluidics chan-
nel (Bergert et al., 2015), which may also contribute to their
swimming motility.
Our study shows that FBCs play multiple local roles in driving
wound repair and preventing wound infection. We wonder
whether some of these local functions might also partially
extrapolate to the vertebrate wound scenario. Drosophila
FBCs have long been known to systemically produce a variety
of AMPs following infection (Buchon et al., 2014; Lemaitre and
Hoffmann, 2007) and our study reveals that, during wound
infection, FBCs migrate to wounds to release AMPs locally.
A recent study has shown that mouse adipocytes are able to
produce AMPs following bacterial skin infections (Zhang et al.,
2015). Hence, it would be interesting to examine whether
mammalian adipocytes, like Drosophila FBCs, play a local
role during wound healing in delivering AMPs to fight wound
infection.
Given our finding that hemocytes and FBCs collaborate
during the wound repair process to clear cell debris and fight
infection, it is tempting to speculate that these two cell types
communicate with each other during vertebrate wound healing
also. Interestingly, in recent years several mammalian studies
have uncovered complex interactions between adipocytes and
macrophages in white adipose tissue (WAT), with important
implications for tissue regeneration and disease (Shook et al.,
2016). One example is obesity-induced inflammation and insulin
resistance, where, upon overnutrition, the adipocytes in visceral
WAT are thought to release chemokines to stimulate macro-
phage recruitment into fat tissue, leading to smoldering inflam-
mation and subsequently insulin resistance (Osborn and Olefsky,
2012). This is believed to be due to proinflammatory macro-
phages releasing cytokines that attenuate insulin signaling in
various cell types, including adipocytes (Osborn and Olefsky,
2012). In support of these mammalian reports, a recent study
in the fly showed that animals fed a lipid-rich diet display reduced
insulin sensitivity and lifespan, and both of these effects are
mediated by hemocytes (Woodcock et al., 2015).
Thus interactions between adipocytes and immune cells
appear to be key in many diseases, including type 2 diabetes,
and we believe that important insights into these links may be
provided by future studies of the functional relationship and
communication between FBCs and hemocytes during pupal
wound repair in flies.
Our studies in Drosophila pupae flag up novel behaviors and
functions for FBCs in Drosophila and open up genetic opportu-
nities to further our understanding of the important roles played
by adipocytes in repair and regeneration.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Fly Stocks and Preparation
Drosophila melanogaster stocks were maintained on cornmeal molasses food in vials or bottles at 25�C and all crosses were per-
formed at 25�C unless otherwise stated. For transgene induction using the Gal80ts system, 0-1h old pre-pupae were shifted from
18 to 28�C for 16h prior to imaging at 25�C. The following fly lines were used in this study: w67 (as control), Lpp-Gal4 (from Pierre
Leopold) and c564-Gal4 (Kambris et al., 2006) to drive transgene expression in fat body cells, srp-Gal4 (Br€
uckner et al., 2004) to drive
transgene expression in hemocytes and tub-Gal80ts (BL7017) to repress the UAS-Gal4 system in a temperature-dependent manner.
The following UAS-lines were used: UAS-GFP-Ena (Gates et al., 2007), UAS-Cherry-Fimbrin (from Tom Millard), UAS-GFP-Fascin
(Zanet et al., 2009), UAS-GFP (BL6874 and BL6658), UAS-myr-td-Tomato (BL32221), UAS-rd-Tomato (BL36327), UAS-nuclear-
Red-Stinger (Barolo et al., 2004), UAS-GMA (Dutta et al., 2002), UAS-DN-Zipper-YFP (Dawes-Hoang et al., 2005) and UAS-Reaper
(BL5824). Srp>3xmCherry (Gyoergy et al., 2018) was used to label hemocytes in a Gal4-independent manner and srp-GMA (Moreira
et al., 2010) to label hemocytes and FBCs in a Gal4-independent manner. Sqh>Sqh-GFP (Royou et al., 2004), Ubq>Hist-RFP
(BL23651), Ubq>RFP-a-tubulin (Basto et al., 2008) and Ubq>GFP-a-tubulin (Basto et al., 2008) were used to label the epithelium.
Please note that these lines are not specific epithelial markers but also drive some expression in hemocytes, fat body cells and
most other tissues. Attacin>GFP (Tzou et al., 2000) was used as a GFP reporter to show Attacin induction.
The genotypes of the pupae used in each experiment are summarised in the Table S1.
METHODS DETAILS
Microscopy and Wounding
Pupae were aged to the appropriate developmental stage (16-18h APF) in vials at 25�C by transferring newly formed white pre-pupae
(0h APF) to the side of a fresh food vial using forceps and dissecting them after 16-18h. Pupae were placed on double-sided sticky
tape on a glass slide and carefully removed from the pupal case with forceps before being placed on a glass bottom dish. Wounds
were made using a nitrogen-pumped Micropoint ablation laser tuned to 435 nm (Andor Technologies, (Razzell et al., 2013)). For
wound infection, overnight cultures of RFP-E.coli (Vlisidou et al., 2009) were washed 2x in PBS and resuspended 5x concentrated
in PBS to OD 12.5. Wounded pupae were placed on a 1ml drop of RFP-E.coli for 5min and then imaged. Note that, since laser wound-
ing only causes a 0.2-1mm wide hole in the cuticle, it is Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) rather than bacteria that
enter this breach in the cuticle and act as activators at the wound site.
Most still images and movies were collected on a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope utilizing a 60x oil objective, except for
Movie S1 which was generated on a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope utilizing a 20x water immersion objective, or Movie S7 and
Figure 4A where we used a Perkin Elmer UltraView spinning disc system with a 40x oil objective. Movies and images shown are
maximum intensity projections made from approximately 30-60mm Z stacks or lateral views using the 3D-opacity mode in Volocity
and were processed using ImageJ (NIH), Volocity (for Z-plane view), Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator software. If autofluores-
cence from the overlying cuticle hindered observation, the autofluorescence was manually erased before making maximum intensity
projections. The heatmap of GFP fluorescence in Figures 3A and 3C and Movie S3 was made by setting the lookup table to ‘‘Fire’’ with
ImageJ.
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), pupae (16-17h APF) were removed from their pupal case, wounded and fixed in a
mixture of 2% paraformaldehyde and 1.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) and the same volume of heptane
for 1h on a shaker, cutting part of the abdomen off after 30min for optimal penetration of fixative. After washes in 0.1 M caco-
dylate buffer (pH 7.4) and postfixation in 1% osmium tetroxide in 0.1M sodium cacodylate for 2h, the pupae were rinsed in buffer
and in water, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series and embedded in Epon. The pupae were oriented to enable cutting of thick

 transverse sections (1mm), which were stained with Methylene Blue for light-microscopic analysis. Thin sections (around 70 nm)
were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and viewed by TEM (Tecnai 12 equipped with an FEI Eagle 4k x4k CCD
camera).
Image Processing and Analysis
Wound front velocity was measured by subtracting the wound diameter at 30min from the wound diameter at 70min min, divided by
2 and reported in mm/h. Cell tracking was performed in NIH ImageJ (manual tracking) in 1min time intervals. FBCs that were recruited
to the wounds were identified in the movies. The tracks of these wound-recruited FBCs, the FBCs that did not interact with the
wounds, as well as all FBCs pooled, are depicted in Figure S2. In order to gather legitimate, comparable tracks from control, un-
wounded pupae for the measurements of the angle of migration, tracks of cells that did not pass through a circular area with a radius
extending 25mm from the centre of the region of interest within the 30min time window were excluded from further analysis in Figure 2.
The meandering index was calculated by dividing the distance that a cell travelled from its start point by the total track length. The
angle of migration was measured between a line connecting the cell positions at 5 and 20min and the line connecting the cell position
at 5min to the centre of the region of interest. Speed was calculated from the average of the velocities of 1min intervals from 5-10min
post wounding.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Graphical representations and statistical analysis were generated in Prism (GraphPad) and Excel (Microsoft Office). Column scatter-
plots and line plots show the mean ± SEM of all the individual data from repeated experiments. Numbers of pupae/wounds analysed
(n numbers) are shown in the figure legends. For statistical analyses, the data shown in column scatterplots were examined by the
student’s T-test.
