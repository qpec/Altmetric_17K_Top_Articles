Abstract
Many bacterial pathogens hijack macrophages to egress from the port of entry to the lym-
phatic drainage and/or bloodstream, causing dissemination of life-threatening infections.
However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report that Salmo-
nella infection generates directional electric fields (EFs) in the follicle-associated epithelium
of mouse cecum. In vitro application of an EF, mimicking the infection-generated electric
field (IGEF), induces directional migration of primary mouse macrophages to the anode,
which is reversed to the cathode upon Salmonella infection. This infection-dependent direc-
tional switch is independent of the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secre-
tion system. The switch is accompanied by a reduction of sialic acids on glycosylated
surface components during phagocytosis of bacteria, which is absent in macrophages chal-
lenged by microspheres. Moreover, enzymatic cleavage of terminally exposed sialic acids
reduces macrophage surface negativity and severely impairs directional migration of macro-
phages in response to an EF. Based on these findings, we propose that macrophages are
attracted to the site of infection by a combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis; after
phagocytosis of bacteria, surface electrical properties of the macrophage change, and gal-
vanotaxis directs the cells away from the site of infection.

 the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Our current understanding is that
macrophages are recruited to the infected site by sensing gradients of chemokines and/or
cytokines released by damaged cells—a process known as chemotaxis. However, this
mechanism does not explain how macrophages containing the pathogens escape the site
to reach the bloodstream. Here, we use a disseminated Salmonella infection model in
mice and detect electric fields (EFs) generated by Salmonella infection at the gut epithe-
lium, which can drive unidirectional migration of macrophages towards the anode—a
biological process also known as galvanotaxis. We further demonstrate that macrophage
galvanotaxis can be reversed to the cathode by phagocytosis of the bacteria. Based on
these findings, we propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a
combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis; after phagocytosis of bacteria, the electrical
properties of the macrophage change, and galvanotaxis directs the cells away from the site
of infection allowing the escape of the macrophages that contain pathogens.
Introduction
Common bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp. invade the gut
epithelial barrier, preferentially by targeting the relatively small number of M cells located in
the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) [1–3]. Disruption of epithelial integrity releases che-
mokines that attract immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages—a process known as
chemotaxis [4–7]. Subsequent phagocytosis and clearance of these pathogens by immune cells
usually stops the infection. However, some of these bacterial pathogens have developed strate-
gies, such as the type III secretion systems in Salmonella spp. [8–12], to evade macrophage kill-
ing and survive inside the macrophage [13–16], an environment in which the pathogen is
hidden from the immune system. Survival within the macrophage allows the pathogen to
spread from its entry site to the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other organs via the blood-
stream, resulting in life-threatening consequences [17–19]. Although chemotaxis can explain
how macrophages reach an infected site, it cannot explain how macrophages harboring patho-
gens escape from the bacterial entry site to reach the lymphatic drainage and/or bloodstream,
a critical initial step in the dissemination process that is understudied and poorly understood.
Bioelectric signals have been implicated in development [20–23], wound healing [24–26],
and regeneration [27,28]. For example, a wound collapses the transepithelial potential (TEP)
difference of an intact epithelial barrier, generating laterally oriented endogenous electric fields
(EFs) of up to 1.4 V cm−1, as well as local electric current densities (JI) of several μA cm−2.
These bioelectric phenomena actively control wound healing in the skin and cornea [25,29];
however, they are extremely challenging to study in the gut epithelium due to limited accessi-
bility and have never been characterized in vivo during an active infection. Nonetheless, it is
generally appreciated that an EF on this scale can drive directional cell migration—a process
known as electrotaxis or galvanotaxis [21]. Many cell types, regardless of their origin, respond
to an exogenous EF by directional migration toward the cathode [25,30], whereas others, e.g.,
human keratinocytes (HaCat cells) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, migrate toward
the anode [31]. Macrophages and lymphocytes also undergo galvanotaxis in vitro and in vivo
[32–34].
In the present study, we have developed an ex vivo mouse cecum model of Salmonella
infection that enables bioelectricity measurement. We report that Salmonella infection gener-
ates a directional EF at the bacterial entry sites that can recruit macrophages by galvanotaxis.
We demonstrate that primary macrophages reverse galvanotaxis direction upon Salmonella

 infection by modifying their surface glycan composition, which reduces the negative electric
charge on the surface. This directional switch is independent of the Salmonella pathogenicity
island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system, a major virulence determinant responsible for Sal-
monella invasion. Instead, it may require certain glycosidases that are widely conserved in Sal-
monella spp., because cleavage of surface-exposed sialic acids with a potent neuraminidase
caused severe defects of macrophage galvanotaxis.
Results and discussion
Development of an ex vivo mouse cecum model of Salmonella infection for
bioelectric characterization
The mouse is an ideal organism for understanding human infectious diseases and is widely
used to study bacterial pathogenesis and mucosal immunity of enteropathogenic bacteria [35–
40]. Previously, we have successfully measured bioelectric currents in various tissue and organ
cultures using the noninvasive vibrating probe [41–44]; however, measuring bioelectric cur-
rents in the mouse small intestinal epithelium is challenging due to limited accessibility [45].
Therefore, we developed a new ex vivo cecum model for measuring bioelectric activity in the
gut epithelium (S1 Fig). This model is based on the well-established mouse typhoid model, in
which mice orally infected with Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium)
develop disseminated infection that mimics human typhoid disease [36]. Although the ileum
is the most commonly targeted organ to study pathogen–host interactions in vivo, it is too
small for the bioelectrical measurements in our ex vivo experimental setting. Instead, the size
of the mouse cecum is anatomically optimal. Salmonella invades the cecum in mice and causes
acute appendicitis in humans [46]. Furthermore, we can easily identify the FAE under a dis-
secting microscope, because we found that 90% of C57BL/6 mice have only 1 Peyer’s patch
around the blind-end apex, containing 6 to 11 lymphatic follicles.
Active bioelectricity pervades the FAE in the healthy murine cecum
Using microelectrodes [28] in the ex vivo mouse cecum model, we measured a TEP of up to 15
mV, lumen-positive in uninfected mice. Notably, the TEP in the FAE was significantly smaller
than that of the surrounding villi (Fig 1A). Next, using a vibrating probe to measure the JI
close to the gut surface, we detected outward currents at the FAE and inward currents at the
villus epithelium, with a magnitude of around 1 μA cm−2 (Fig 1B). Such currents were not
detected in the serosal epithelium, despite the presence of a TEP (Fig 1A), nor in formalin-
fixed epithelia (Fig 1B), suggesting the existence of active bioelectricity restricted to the muco-
sal epithelium.
It has been well appreciated that mammalian intestinal mucosa maintains a large transmu-
cosal potential difference [47,48]. In humans, that potential is up to 12 mV, lumen-negative, in
the fasting jejunum and ileum [49,50]. Rats, mice, chickens, and fish all maintain a TEP of up
to 5 mV in their intestinal epithelium, as measured with Ussing chambers [51–55]; however,
these measurements provide no spatiotemporal information [45]. The TEP of control murine
ceca (up to 15 mV) that we have measured directly with glass electrodes under microscopic
resolution were well within the physiological range described above; however, it differed spa-
tially, i.e., the TEP of the FAE was significantly lower than the TEP of the surrounding villus
epithelium (Fig 1A). Using an ultrasensitive vibrating probe, we further detected ionic currents
that run in opposite directions between the FAE and surrounding villi (Fig 1B). Together,
these findings unveil lateral voltage gradients and/or constant current loops running between
these two structurally and functionally distinct epithelia. In the normal gut scenario, such a

 bioelectrical landscape may prevent commensals from accidentally entering the FAE and
enable the pathogens to specifically target M cells via bacterial galvanotaxis [56].
Salmonella infection generates bioelectric fields at the FAE of its entry site
Salmonella invades the intestinal epithelium, preferentially by targeting M cells located at an
FAE [1,57]. If a wound disrupting an epithelium can generate a steady EF, one would envisage
that similar EFs must be produced at the Salmonella entry site because of the breakage of epi-
thelial integrity and subsequent short-circuit of the transmucosal potential difference. This is
indeed the case in our model. In mice intragastrically challenged with S. Typhimurium, the
peak JI remarkably reversed to become inward in FAE compared to control mice, whereas that
of the villus epithelium increased nonsignificantly (Fig 1B). Consistent with this finding, we
also detected high variation in TEP from individual S. Typhimurium–infected mice (up to 25

ionic currents running from the breached epithelium into the deep intestinal wall (color-coded arrow indicates the direction of current flow).

 mV), still lumen-positive (Fig 1A), which has also been observed in chemically induced colitis
in rats [58]. More importantly, penetrating electrodes through disrupted FAE up to 200 μm in
depth revealed a stepwise increase in TEP (S2 Fig), suggesting the existence of an electric
potential gradient generated by the S. Typhimurium infection.
Bacterial invasion and subsequent dissemination to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and
spleen were verified by determination of colony-forming units (CFUs) (S4A Fig), and disrup-
tion of FAE was assessed by histological staining (S4B Fig). S. Typhimurium was undetectable
in some of the MLNs and spleens, indicating that some of the FAE and surrounding villi were
either uninfected or mildly infected, which explains the wide distribution of TEP and JI mea-
sured in the S. Typhimurium–challenged mice.
Based on these results, we coined the term infection-generated electric field (IGEF) (Fig
1C) to distinguish it from a wound-generated electric field (WGEF) [26]. We demonstrate, for
the first time, that Salmonella infection generated a steady EF (up to 5 V cm−1, provided an
epithelial thickness of 50 μm) that drives minute directional electric currents, running from
the breached FAE into the deep intestinal wall in a stepwise manner. Although how the IGEFs
are formed is currently unknown, we speculate on a couple of possible mechanisms. First, in
order to establish a steady EF, a potential gradient or a circuit must be formed. Even though
there are accumulated charges segregated by the epithelium (positive at the apical side), in a
healthy gut a circuit is unlikely to be formed by the epithelium itself due to high resistance of
the epithelium, which is sealed by tight junctions. However, given that the intestinal lumen is
alkaline (more negative in terms of electrogenesis), a micropotential gradient could be devel-
oped in close proximity to the apical side of the gut epithelia, which can drive outward ionic
currents (Fig 1C). Second, differential expression and asymmetric distribution of ion pumps
and channels essential for selective absorption and/or secretion of electrogenic ions by entero-
cytes and M cells [47,48] are likely to be critical for the generation of the aforementioned bio-
electricity. Future studies using specific channel blockers in combination with our bioelectrical
experimental model and techniques will help to pinpoint the molecular mechanism of an
IGEF by identifying the channel(s) or pump(s) involved. Third, as in the formation of a
WGEF [21,59], Salmonella preferentially invades and destroys M cells and collapses the epithe-
lial barrier at the FAE (S4B Fig), which short-circuits the TEP. Subsequently, the short-cir-
cuited and augmented TEP could then drive inward ionic currents as supported by the
measurements of stepwise increase of the TEP (S2B Fig). Fourth, in contrast to the healthy
alkaline gut, the microenvironment at the Salmonella entry site (i.e., the FAE) is likely to be
more acidic (more positive in terms of electrogenesis) because of the local inflammatory
responses [60] and metabolic changes [61] induced by Salmonella infection. Such a microenvi-
ronmental pH switch could be related or attributed to the reversal of ionic current flow as we
detected with vibrating probes (Fig 1B). Like the injury currents reported by Sawyer and col-
leagues in early publications [62–64], IGEF-driving ionic currents could affect small blood ves-
sels in the intestinal wall and mesentery to cause a transvascular potential drop or reversal,
resulting in 2 possible consequences: an intravascular occlusion that may benefit transen-
dothelial penetration of immune cells (e.g., monocytes, leukocytes) and/or the creation of a
galvanotactic route between the infected epithelium and the electrically impacted vessels [65].
Salmonella reverses the directional migration of IGEF-guided macrophage
galvanotaxis in vitro
Although IGEFs may provide a guidance cue for the enterocytes or even local stem cells, con-
tributing to the repair process of damaged epithelium, the major focus of this work is, rather,
to investigate its biopathological role in the systemic Salmonella infection, specifically during

 the initiation of macrophage-driven dissemination. Previous studies have shown that applying
an EF in vitro can direct macrophage galvanotaxis to the anode [32–34]. We confirmed this
phenotype by demonstrating that the primary mouse peritoneal macrophages (PMs), in
response to an exogenous EF tuned to mimic the in vivo IGEF (mathematics in Materials and
methods), underwent robust unidirectional migration to the anode (S1 Movie). This unidirec-
tional migration was verified by immunostaining showing that nearly 100% of macrophages
were polarized to the anode with a distinct morphology characterized by a leading pseudopo-
dium of dense actin meshwork and a rearward uropod. However, upon challenge with S.
Typhimurium IR715, the average directionality of EF-induced galvanotaxis decreased signifi-
cantly, with approximately 41% of the macrophages reversing their migratory direction from
the anode to the cathode (Fig 2 and S2 Movie). Although PMs have been widely used in bacte-
rial infection studies [66], likely due to the ease of harvesting, the most commonly used pri-
mary murine macrophages are the bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) because of
their high yield and less heterogeneous nature, which makes them phenotypically and func-
tionally different from PMs [67]. To exclude the possibility that the observed bidirectional
migration is restricted to PMs, we generated and tested galvanotaxis of BMDMs as we did with
PMs. Although both types of macrophages exhibited similar unidirectional migration (mean
directionality: −0.98 versus −0.88) to the anode, reversal in BMDMs infected by Salmonella
IR715 was more robust than in PMs infected by the same Salmonella strain (mean directional-
ity: 0.36 versus −0.18) (Fig 2C and S5B Fig). Notably, this phenotype can be reproduced in
BMDMs challenged by another 2 virulent S. Typhimurium strains, LT2 and SL1344 (S5 Fig),
suggesting that directional migration in response to electrical stimuli is an intrinsic hallmark
of the macrophages regardless of their origins and that the ability to manipulate and subvert
galvanotaxis in these macrophages is conserved in virulent Salmonella spp.
If the cells had simply stopped sensing the EF, then we would have observed random migra-
tion, as was the case for control macrophages not subjected to an EF (Fig 2E). The observed
change in migration pattern can be attributed to S. Typhimurium infection for a variety of rea-
sons. First, a gentamycin protection assay confirmed the presence of intracellular bacteria (Fig
2D); second, flow cytometry demonstrated a high S. Typhimurium infection rate (approxi-
mately 53%) (S6 Fig); and third, high-resolution confocal microscopy revealed that macro-
phages containing intracellular S. Typhimurium switched polarity to the cathode (Fig 2G).
Based on these findings, we conclude that Salmonella-containing macrophages respond to gal-
vanotaxis stimuli by reversing their primary directional migration.
Infection-dependent directional switch of macrophage galvanotaxis is SPI-
1 independent
Macrophages are professional phagocytes that uptake a broad range of substances; meanwhile,
pathogenic Salmonella has developed several virulence means to evade macrophage killing,
with SPI-1 being the major virulence factor responsible for colonization and invasion [10,68].
To better understand whether the directional reversal is phagocytosis dependent or SPI-1 spe-
cific, we monitored galvanotaxis under identical conditions in BMDMs challenged with (i)
fluorescently labeled microspheres similar in size to bacteria, (ii) S. Typhimurium constitu-
tively expressing mCherry, and (iii) a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-expressing ΔinvA
mutant that lacks a functional SPI-1 (unable to inject its effectors into cells) [69] (Fig 3A).
Macrophages challenged with microspheres exhibited migratory behavior similar to that of
controls, i.e., unidirectional migration to the anode (Fig 3B and S3 Movie). Macrophages chal-
lenged with ΔinvA migrated with a significantly decreased overall directionality close to that of
macrophages infected with wild-type (WT) Salmonella (Fig 3B), even though the number of

 intracellular mutants was indeed lower than that of the WT (Fig 3C). Time-lapse recording
captured a marked opposing directional migration pattern: macrophages containing micro-
spheres migrated to the anode, and macrophages with either WT or ΔinvA bacteria inside
migrated to the cathode (Fig 3D and 3E, and S3 Movie), further confirming that the observed
directional switch was Salmonella infection dependent. There were similar phagocytosis and/
or infection rates between the macrophages challenged with microspheres or Salmonella in the
given multiplicity of infection (MOI; S7A and S7B Fig), as verified by flow cytometry (S6 Fig).
Cells containing no or variable microspheres migrated to the anode exclusively (S7C and S7D
Fig), ruling out mechanisms solely based on phagocytosis. The fact that cells containing either
WT or ΔinvA migrated to the cathode suggests that the SPI-1 type III secretion system is not
required or, at least, is insufficient for the directional switch. These data are in accordance with
previous studies that identified an SPI-1-independent pathway contributing to early dissemi-
nation of S. Typhimurium in the mouse typhoid model [17]. We therefore argue for the exis-
tence of a general infection-dependent mechanism that involves phagocytosis and subsequent
interplay between the macrophages and internalized bacterial pathogens.
Salmonella but not microspheres decreases surface-exposed sialic acids in
macrophages
Charged cell-surface components are critical for EF-induced motility in 3H3 cells [70] and
have been implicated in electro-osmosis of concanavalin A (Con A) binding receptors on the
surface of myotomal spheres [71]. We hypothesized that the directional switch of macrophage
galvanotaxis could result from bacteria-induced modifications to the charged components of
the cell surface, which would not occur following microsphere challenge (Fig 4A). To this end,
we screened Salmonella-infected and control macrophages against a panel of fluorescently
labeled lectins (glycan-binding proteins) capable of detecting charged and uncharged cell sur-
face glycans (S1 Table). The normalized mean fluorescent intensity of Maackia Amurensis
Lectin II (MAL-2), a lectin that recognizes pathogen-binding sialic acids, was significantly
decreased in macrophages infected by Salmonella but not in those carrying microspheres (Fig
4B–4D). Marked Galanthus Nivalis Lectin (GNL)- and Con A–binding aggregates were visible
within macrophages infected by Salmonella (S8 and S9 Figs), raising the possibility that the
decrease in MAL-2-binding sialic acids could be the result of bacterial internalization and sub-
sequent degradation.

macrophages with sialylated glycoproteins or lipids (small green circles) migrate to the anode. Activated macrophages with reduced negativity, either
through enzymatic activities of the Salmonella or internalization and/or degradation, switch direction to the cathode, whereas macrophages that
phagocytosed beads via nonsialylated surface components (brown squares) still migrate to the anode. (B) Representative confocal images of surface

 of BMDMs under various conditions. The negative zeta potential of macrophages infected by
S. Typhimurium was significantly reduced, i.e., less negative than that of control macrophages
(P < 0.05) (Fig 4E). By contrast, macrophages challenged with microspheres showed a nonsig-
nificant zeta potential change compared to that of control macrophages (Fig 4E), suggesting
that the decrease in surface-exposed sialic acids and subsequent reduction of surface negativity
is mediated by active bacterial product(s) [73].
If a decrease of the negatively charged sialic acids of the surface glycoproteins is critical for
the directional switch in macrophage galvanotaxis, then cells with their sialic acids enzymati-
cally removed should exhibit a switch or at least a defect in directional migration when
exposed to an EF. To test this, we treated freshly isolated mouse BMDMs with a potent neur-
aminidase (an enzyme that cleaves terminal sialic acid residues from surface-exposed glyco-
proteins) [74]. Cleavage of sialic acids following enzymatic treatment was confirmed by flow
cytometry and confocal microscopy (Fig 5A–5C). As predicted, the zeta potentials of neur-
aminidase-treated macrophages were significantly reduced (Fig 5D). These cells also lost
anodal migration compared to control macrophages monitored in parallel (Fig 5E and 5F, and
S4 Movie). Further inspection and morphological quantification of macrophages stained with
fluorescently labeled actin and/or lectin revealed that 71% of the macrophages treated with
neuraminidase failed to establish a polarity and notably, 12% of the cells were polarized to the
cathode whereas nearly all the control macrophages (97%) were polarized to the anode in
response to the EF (Fig 5G).
It is well known that a change in the environmental pH can dramatically influence the
growth and virulence of Salmonella [75,76]. Moreover, by exposure to acidic pH, a condition
that is required for activation of several Salmonella virulence factors [77–79], it is possible to
modify macrophage surface electrical properties [30]. Therefore, to further determine the
importance of surface negativity, we incubated BMDMs in medium at pH 5.8 that markedly
reduced the zeta potential (S11A Fig), presumably through protonation of the sialylated sur-
face molecules. Similar to the neuraminidase treatment, galvanotaxis of BMDMs under acidic
conditions was significantly impaired, resulting in nearly half of the macrophages (47%) losing
their directional migration and 14% of the macrophages reversing their polarity to the cathode
(S11B-S11D Fig and S5 Movie). Although these data are consistent with our previous studies,
showing that low pH abrogates directional migration of epithelial cells in response to an EF
[80,81], it also suggests that the acidic environment is not only required for the activation of
Salmonella but also contributes to triggering dissemination.
How does Salmonella infection instruct macrophages to reverse EF-directed migration?
Firstly, it is important to note that infecting macrophages with a SPI-1 mutant resulted in a
directional switch similar to that of WT, with nearly all the macrophages containing live fluo-
rescent protein-expressing bacteria migrating to the cathode (Fig 3 and S3 Movie). This sug-
gests a general mechanism, independent of this major virulence factor, even though other
specific factor(s) may still be involved [82,83]. Previously reported effects have suggested that
negatively charged surface glycan moieties are critical for EF-induced cell motility and polari-
zation, which are consistent with our data, and provide a long sought-after mechanism of
action. Because macrophages challenged with microspheres did not show a significantly
reduced zeta potential (Fig 4E), it is likely that the decrease in surface-exposed sialic acids and
reduction of surface negativity is mediated by active bacterial product(s) rather than by meta-
bolic changes in the host itself. It is also important to note that although both Salmonella infec-
tion and neuraminidase treatment decreased the surface-exposed sialic acids, the latter caused
a serious defect in macrophage galvanotaxis without reversing the overall directionality (Fig
5E), in contrast to Salmonella infection (Fig 3B). There may be multiple glycosidases involved
in surface glycan modification to reverse directionality (Fig 5H) because Salmonella possesses

 at least 51 putative glycosidases that likely function in glycan degradation [84]. In fact, a recent
study identified several glycosidases, including a putative neuraminidase, as new virulence fac-
tors essential for Salmonella infection of epithelial cells, which is again independent of the SPI-
1 [85]. We are in the process of performing genetic knockouts to identify the factors involved.
It is also possible that modification of surface glycan and reduction of zeta potential were
mediated by internalization during phagocytosis of the bacterium itself rather than by bacterial
enzymatic activities. For example, macrophages express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recog-
nize structurally conserved molecules derived from Salmonella and other pathogens. All TLRs
contain N-linked glycosylation consensus sites, and both TLR2 and TLR4 require glycosylation
for surface translocation and function [86,87]. Binding of Salmonella to these glycosylated
receptors and subsequent internalization may reduce surface negativity of macrophages, lead-
ing to directional switch under an EF. This idea is supported by our observations in which the
accumulation of certain lectin binding aggregates within macrophages infected by Salmonella
but not in cells challenged by microspheres (S8 and S9 Figs). It is also possible that a macro-
phage can uptake microspheres without significantly changing its zeta potential (e.g., through
a neutralized receptor) and thus still migrate to the anode.
Disseminated Salmonella infection is a major health problem of developing countries,
responsible for approximately 433,000 deaths annually [88]. Understanding the mechanisms
that trigger dissemination is critical for efforts to target this key process for preventive and
therapeutic purposes. We propose that macrophages are attracted to the site of infection by a
combination of chemotaxis and galvanotaxis, driving the cells in the same direction. After
phagocytosis of bacteria, surface electrical properties of the macrophage change, and galvano-
taxis directs the cells away from the site of infection (Fig 6). Our study represents a new per-
spective for the initiating mechanisms, suggesting that Salmonella disseminates through
infection-generated bioelectrical control of macrophage trafficking. It is important to empha-
size that the demonstrated bidirectional migration of macrophages to the IGEF-like EFs is not
a physical electrophoresis (movement of charged particles under direct-current EF) but rather
a complex yet poorly understood biological process that requires phosphoinositide 3-kinases
and other critical signaling activities, as well as the cellular motility machinery [25,81]. It is
also worth emphasizing that the model proposed in this work is not mutually exclusive with
respect to chemotaxis but offers an alternative and/or complementary mechanism of direc-
tional migration. Both directional cues can coexist and play equally important roles in orches-
trating the initial stage of the innate immune response against bacterial infection (Fig 6),
although a chemical gradient could be overridden by a strong electrical stimulus [59,89]. Both
chemotaxis and galvanotaxis likely share critical signaling pathways as suggested in studies of
macrophage-like Dictyostelium, which are highly sensitive to cyclic adenosine monophosphate
gradients, as well as to electrical potential gradients [90–92]. Future work utilizing transgenic
animals and pharmacological perturbations to target specific pathways (known or unknown)
will help to pinpoint key molecules mediating the infection-dependent directional reversal
(i.e., the molecular mechanisms to initiate disseminated infection) and response to bioelectric
signaling.
negatively charged (sign with small green circles) macrophages undergo robust directional migration to the anode. Phagocytosing Salmonella
reduces surface negativity of the macrophage through catalytic activities of certain glycosidases, as exemplified by the cleavage of sialic acids
with Neu’se (scissors). Consequently, activated macrophages can either undergo defective directional migration or switch direction to the
cathode. Macrophages that phagocytosed beads through binding of nonsialylated surface components (brown squares) still migrate to the
anode. Arrows indicate both direction and strength of macrophage galvanotaxis. BMDM, bone marrow-derived macrophage; cosθ, cosine

 Triggering bacterial dissemination mediated by macrophage galvanotaxis might be a com-
mon strategy, not only for pathogenic Salmonella but also for other bacterial pathogens that
are able to invade macrophages and survive intracellularly. Although the present work deals
primarily with gut epithelium and enteric bacteria, the general mechanism that emerged from
this work could also apply to other mucous epithelia such as the respiratory tract and its associ-
ated pathogens, e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis (the causative agent of tuberculosis) [93],
which is another major public health concern.
Materials and methods
Mice and surgery
The mouse strains used were in a C57BL/6 background (both male and female mice were used
in experiments). Mice were purchased from Jackson lab and maintained under a strict 12-h
light cycle and given a regular chow diet in a specific pathogen-free facility at University of
California (UC), Davis. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with regulatory
guidelines and standards set by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of UC
Davis. In brief, we dissected mouse cecum following euthanasia and opened longitudinally
along the mesenteric attachment remnant to avoid incision damage to the single Peyer’s patch
Fig 6. IGEF at gut epithelium and model of macrophage galvanotaxis in initiating dissemination. Salmonella invades and disrupts
gut epithelial integrity, preferentially at the FAE, generating an IGEF (red to yellow gradient) that recruits resident macrophages to the
bacteria entry sites—alone or synergistically with chemotaxis. Macrophages invaded by Salmonella revert galvanotaxis direction
through the modification of surface electric properties to reach the lymphatic drainage and/or bloodstream, thus initiating
dissemination. FAE, follicle-associated epithelium; IGEF, infection-generated electric field.

 located under the antimesenteric mucosa near the apex (S1A Fig). After thorough washing in
mouse Ringer’s solution (154 mM NaCl, 5.6 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2.2 mM CaCl2, 10 mM
glucose, and 20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4]) to remove the luminal contents, we placed the cecum
with mucous side facing up, on a 30˚ slope of silicone gel prepared from polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) in custom-made measuring chambers. The cecum was aligned and immobilized with
fine metal (tungsten) pins prior to taking measurements (S1B Fig). This process was usually
completed within 5 min.
Measuring TEP with glass microelectrodes
We used glass microelectrodes to directly measure the TEP of intestinal epithelium as previ-
ously described [28,94]. TEPs were recorded by microelectrode impalement through the epi-
thelial layers. Microelectrodes (1–2 μm tip diameter; NaCl 3 M electrolyte) had resistances of
approximately 1 to 2 MO, and the potentials were offset to 0 mV prior to impalement. Cecal
FAE and adjacent villus epithelium were discriminated under a dissecting microscope within a
Faraday cage on an antivibration table. In some cases, the TEP were measured as follows: first
at the epithelial surface (0 μm), then stepwise at 50, 100, and 200 μm in depth, controlled by a
micromanipulator (S2A Fig). The potential typically returns to the baseline of 0 mV after
microelectrode withdrawal. If the reference baseline was > ±1 and � ±5 mV, the value was
subtracted from the TEP recorded as shown in the equation (S2B Fig); if > ± 5 mV, the trace
was rejected. As a control, we measured the TEP of serosa epithelium and the TEP of forma-
lin-fixed mucous epithelium. Measurements were performed at room temperature in mouse
Ringer’s solution. Data were acquired (saturated sampling at 100 Hz) and extracted using
pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices) and analyzed using Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA).
Measuring ionic currents with vibrating probes
We used noninvasive vibrating probes to measure the electric current density (JI) in μA cm−2
of mouse cecum epithelium as previously described [28,41,42]. The probes, platinum-electro-
plated at the tip (approximately 30 μm ball diameter), vibrated at a frequency between 100 and
200 Hz. Prior to measurements, the probe was calibrated to the experimental conditions by an
applied JI of 1.5 μA cm−2 (S3C Fig). Under a dissecting microscope, mounted mouse ceca were
positioned in the nonconductive measuring chamber (S3A Fig). The plane of probe vibration
was perpendicular to the epithelial surface at a distance as close as possible (S3B Fig). JI was
recorded until the plateau peak was reached (<1 min) (S3C Fig). Reference values were
recorded with the probe away from the epithelium surface (�1 mm) (S3A Fig). Measurements
were taken at room temperature in mouse Ringer’s solution. During calibrations and measure-
ments, a Faraday “wall” (grounded aluminum-wrapped cardboard) covered the microscope.
As a control, we measured JI near the surface of serosal epithelium and formalin-fixed mucous
epithelium. Data were acquired and extracted using WinWCP V4 (Strathclyde Electrophysiol-
ogy Software, University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, United Kindom) and analyzed using Excel
(Microsoft, Redmond, WA).

Typhimurium were incubated aerobically at 37˚C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (per liter: 10 g
tryptone, 5 g yeast extract, 10 g NaCl) or on LB agar plates (1.5% Difco agar) overnight. Antibi-
otics were used at the following concentrations unless stated otherwise: 30 μg ml−1

 chloramphenicol, 50 μg ml−1 nalidixic acid, 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin, 50 μg ml−1 kanamycin,
and 10 μg ml−1 tetracycline.
Construction of S. Typhimurium expressing fluorescent proteins
In an effort to monitor live intracellular Salmonella during macrophage galvanotaxis we con-
structed an S. Typhimurium strain derived from IR715 that constitutively expresses mCherry
coded in its genome [95]. In brief, the glmS::mCherry allele was transferred to IR715 via P22
transduction from the donor strain S. Typhimurium SL1344St (a gift from Leigh Knodler)
[96] and selected by chloramphenicol. To remove the FRT-flanked chloramphenicol cassette,
the transductant was transformed with pCP20 encoding FLP recombinase. The resulting strain
constitutively expressing mCherry encoded by glmS::mCherry::FRT was designated KLL18.
The GFP-expressing SPI-1 mutant ΔinvA was generated by electroporating pGFT/RalFc
into AJB75 [69]. The plasmid pGFT/RalFc was constructed in 2 steps. First, a fragment of a
gfp-mut3 gene under the control of the constitutively active kanamycin-resistance gene aphA3
promoter was amplified from pJC43 [97] with the primers GFPmut3-F (50- AGAGCTCCAGC
GAACCATTTAAGGTGATAG -30) and GFPmut3-R (50- ACTGCAGTTATTTGTATAGTTC
ATCCATGCC -30). This fragment was then digested with SacI/PstI and cloned into pFT/
RalFc, a low–copy-number plasmid based on pBBR1-MCS4 [98].
Oral infection in a mouse model of human typhoid fever
The mouse is a well-established animal model for studying Salmonella pathogenesis [35].
C57BL/6 and other mice carrying a mutation in nramp1 develop disseminated infections
when challenged by S. Typhimurium, which mimics human typhoid fever [99]. For the mouse
infection experiment, we used the hyper-disseminative D23580 strain [100,101]. In brief,
D23580 was used to inoculate LB broth and incubated overnight at 37˚C. C57BL/6 mice (6 to
10 wk old, mixed sexes) were intragastrically infected with 109 bacteria (actual inoculum was
determined by plating) in 0.1 ml LB broth. Uninfected mice used as a control were given 0.1
ml sterile LB broth in place of Salmonella.
Mice were euthanized at 16 h and 40 h post infection (PI) by CO2 asphyxiation followed by
cervical dislocation as the secondary method of euthanasia. The 16 h PI was chosen based on
previous studies showing that the best-characterized route for the phagocytes harboring Sal-
monella to reach the bloodstream normally requires between 12 and 20 h [17,102]. MLNs and
spleens were collected aseptically and homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for
CFU enumeration. Ceca were dissected, cleaned, and then either mounted for bioelectrical
measurement, prepared for histopathological fixation, or homogenized in PBS for CFU
enumeration.
Histology
Ceca were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. After fixation, tissues were routinely pro-
cessed, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin–eosin.
Isolation and culture of primary mouse PMs and BMDMs
Both PMs and BMDMs were isolated from C57BL/6 mice (6 to 10 wk old, mixed sex) following
standard procedures as previously described [103]. PMs were seeded onto 6-well plates and
allowed to adhere to the plastic for 1 to 2 d in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Invitrogen) and 1× antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Invitrogen). BMDMs were cul-
tured in the same medium as described above but supplemented with 20% L-929 conditioned

 medium for 6 d (plus an extra feed at day 3), followed by 1-d culture without the conditioned
medium. Adherent macrophages were then harvested by gently scraping with a “policeman”
cell scraper and used for subsequent experiments accordingly. Cell viability was determined by
trypan blue staining and counting.
Our initial galvanotaxis experiments were carried out in PMs. Because we observed better
directional switch in BMDMs infected by Salmonella (S5 Fig), subsequent experiments were
done in BMDMs, unless stated otherwise.
Gentamycin protection assay to determine intracellular bacteria CFU
The gentamycin protection assays were carried out as previously described [104]. In 24-well
tissue culture-treated plates, 2 × 105 cells were seeded per well for 5 to 6 h in culture medium
(DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum and no antibiotics). Salmonella were grown overnight
and used to infect macrophages at an MOI of 20. After 60 min of incubation, cells were gently
washed 3× with PBS and further incubated in gentamycin-containing culture media at a final
concentration of 50 μg ml−1 for an additional 60 min. Afterwards, media were replaced with
culture media containing 10 μg ml−1 gentamycin for the duration of the experiment. Intracel-
lular CFU was measured at 16 h PI. To measure intracellular CFU, macrophages were lysed
using 0.5% Tween 20 for 5 min at room temperature and released by scraping with 1 ml pipette
tips. CFUs were enumerated by plating.
Infection, challenge, and treatment of macrophages
Typically, 4 × 104 primary mouse macrophages were seeded per well of engineered silicon
stencils sealed in custom-made EF chambers (see “Engineering silicone stencil and EF cham-
ber design” for details) or 96-well glass bottom plates (Nunc) or 2 × 105 cells per well in
24-well tissue culture-treated plates depending on different experiment needs for 5 to 6 h in
culture medium. Overnight cultures of Salmonella or fluorescently labeled microspheres were
used to infect and/or challenge macrophages at an MOI of 20. The rest of the procedures were
similar to the gentamycin protection assay. Cells were cultured in medium containing 10 μg
ml−1 gentamycin for 16 h, and subsequent galvanotaxis experiments were carried out in the
same medium containing gentamycin.
For the neuraminidase treatment, cells were incubated in culture medium containing 100
mU ml−1 neuraminidase from Vibrio cholerae (Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 min at 37˚C [70]. Cells
were then washed with culture medium, and subsequent galvanotaxis experiments were car-
ried out in the culture medium containing no neuraminidase.
For the low pH experiments, cells were incubated in culture medium of pH 5.8 buffered
with 15 mM MES (Sigma-Aldrich) for 60 min, and subsequent galvanotaxis experiments were
carried out in the same media of pH 5.8 [81]. Control experiments were carried out always in
parallel in culture medium of pH 7.4 buffered with 14.4 mM HEPES (Invitrogen).
Galvanotaxis assay
1. Engineering silicone stencil and EF chamber design. We have tested cover glass and
plastics coated with different substrates and found that macrophages perform robust and con-
sistent galvanotaxis when cultured in tissue culture dishes (Corning). Therefore, our EF cham-
bers were customized based on 100 mm tissue culture dishes. To facilitate group comparability
and EF control, we engineered removable and reusable silicone stencils of multiple wells
(diameter of 8 mm, thickness of 2.4 mm) to seed the same batch of cells that can be challenged
and/or treated with different bacteria and/or substances and monitored under identical

 galvanotactic conditions simultaneously [105]. The EF tunnel height is fixed at around 120 μm
by double-sided silicone tapes cut by a computer-controlled laser cutter [80].
2. EF application and time-lapse recording.
We applied exogenous EF as previously
described [42,105–107]. The EF strength is based on the IGEF we measured at the gut epithe-
lium in 2 ways. First, we detected an inward JI of approximately 1.5 μA cm−2 at Salmonella-
infected FAE. The mouse Ringer’s solution we used in the measurement has a resistivity (ρ) of
19.47 mO cm, measured with a conductivity meter. A common approximation to the current
density assumes that the current is simply proportional to the EF, as expressed by the following
equation (derived from Ohm’s law):
JI ¼ E
r ;
ð1Þ
where E is the EF. Plugging JI and ρ into the equation, we calculated that a density of 1.5 μA
cm−2 equals an EF of 0.77 V cm−1. Based on trials in rabbit corneal epithelium, the in vivo JI is
likely 2 to 4 times larger than the ex vivo JI because of the higher resistances of the tissues and
of the higher physiological temperature. Second, we detected a TEP of approximately 25 mV
crossing a single layer of Salmonella-infected gut epithelium. This generates an EF of 5 V cm−1
providing an epithelial cell height of 50 μm. After testing a range around those values, we have
empirically chosen an EF of 4 V cm−1 because it consistently induced significant directional
migration of primary mouse macrophages, although biased directional migration can be
achieved by an EF as small as 0.5 V cm−1. Actual EF strengths were measured and determined
with a voltmeter before and after each EF application.
Cell migration was monitored with a Carl Zeiss Observer Z1 inverted microscope equipped
with a motorized stage and an incubation chamber (37˚C and 5% CO2). Time-lapse contrast
images and/or images of appropriate fluorescence channels were captured using MetaMorph
NX program (Molecular Devices). A Retiga R6 (QImaging) scientific CCD camera and long
exposure time (approximately 2 s) were used to detect and monitor intracellular Salmonella
expressing fluorescent proteins. Typically, in each experiment, 2 to 4 fields of each condition
under a 10× or a long-distance 20× lens were chosen. Images were taken at 5-min intervals for
up to 3 h unless stated otherwise.
3. Image processing and data analysis and/or presentation.
Time-lapse images were
imported, processed, and assembled in ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij). To quantify single-
cell and population motility, we extracted the trajectory of each cell migration (>30 cells for
each condition) using an automatic and/or manual tracking tool [42,81,105]. Directionality as
directedness in cosine theta (cosθ), in which θ is the angle that each cell moved with respect to
the EF vector, was quantified from the coordinates of each trajectory [108,109]. If a cell moved
perfectly along the field vector toward the cathode, the cosine of this angle would be 1; if the
cell moved perpendicular to the field vector, the cosine of this angle would be 0; and if the cell
moved directly toward the anode, the cosine of this angle would be −1. Dead cells (macro-
phages killed by Salmonella) or cells unresponsive to the EF (due to neuraminidase treatment
or acidic conditions) were either washed away or excluded from quantification by migration
speed thresholding. The thresholds were estimated from fixed cells recorded in the same opti-
cal parameters and experiment setting for the live macrophages. The galvanotaxis assays and
quantification of directionality in BMDMs infected with ΔinvA and their isogenic WT Salmo-
nella were assigned in a double-blinded manner.
To simulate cell migration, each cell was numbered and its x and y coordinates were mea-
sured on the first image and on every subsequent image in the image stack, with the x-axis par-
allel to the applied EF. The (x, y) data of each cell were imported with the ImageJ chemotaxis
tool plugin and recalculated based on the optical parameters (lens and camera). Trajectories of

 the cells in each group were simulated in a Cartesian coordinate system by placing the first
coordinates of each cell in the origin (0, 0).
To plot the rose histograms, we combined θ of each time interval of tracked cells in each
group. The vector θ, expressed in radians, was calculated from the coordinates of each trajec-
tory. The distribution of θ in 12 angle bins and their abundance in percentage were plotted in
Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) using a custom script (available upon request).
4. Morphological analysis.
The polarity of macrophages was determined by the relative
distribution of the characterized protrusive lamellipodia front and uropod tail with respect to
the applied EF. These were done by visually inspecting a large number of cells (>50 cells in
each case) from images taken at 3 h after EF exposure or by quantifying cellular actin intensity
of confocal images using ImageJ software with line scan and color function plugins [105].
Immunobiochemistry, lectin staining, and confocal microscopy
Macrophages were seeded in either 96-well glass bottom plates or custom-made EF chambers
and infected, challenged, and/or treated by following procedures as described above. The cells
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde immediately or after EF exposure for 3 h with field ori-
entation marked. Salmonella were detected with a polyclonal antibody specific to Salmonella
spp. (Mybiosource, San Diego, CA) stained by an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary anti-
body. F-actin was labeled by Alexa Fluor 555 Phalloidin. Nuclei were labeled by Hoechst
33342.
In the cases of lectin staining, fixed cells were incubated with FITC-labeled lectin (S1 Table)
overnight at 4˚C, washed extensively, and then stained with DAPI for 10 min on ice.
Cells were photographed using either an inverted (for cells on cover glass with no EF) or an
upright (for cells on plastic EF chambers) Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope (Leica microsys-
tem). Images were processed using ImageJ. Quantification and comparison of fluorescent
intensity were done in images taken in the same batch with the same optical setup and parame-
ters. Lectin binding aggregates stained after permeabilization were quantified by thresholding.
Cells were counted using particle analysis function.
Flow cytometry
Infected, challenged, and/or treated macrophages, handled according to the procedures
described above, were then incubated with Fc-block (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) on ice for 15
min, stained with FITC-labeled lectin (S1 Table) for 1 h on ice, and then stained with Aqua-
LIVE/DEAD (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed
after each step and before being analyzed on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer. Data were analyzed
using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc. Ashland, OR). After gating single cells and live cells, the
geometric mean fluorescence intensity and standard error (SE) were collected for each FITC
lectin in each condition in addition to Fluorescence Minus One (FMO) for FITC-lectin (no
FITC-lectin staining). The geometric mean fluorescence intensity was then standardized
across experiments using the following equation:
xFMO MFI
ð
Þ ¼ xðMFIÞ � FMOðMFIÞ
FMOðSDÞ
;
ð2Þ
where xFMO(MFI) is the standardized geometric mean fluorescence intensity of a specific lectin
for a specific experiment, x(MFI) is the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of a specific lec-
tin for a specific experiment, FMO(MFI) is the geometric mean fluorescence intensity of the
FMO for a specific experiment, and FMO(SD) is the standard deviation of the FMO for a

 specific experiment. Standardized geometric mean fluorescent intensities were then plotted
and tested for statistical significance (S10 Fig).
Measuring zeta potential
Macrophages were seeded onto 24-well tissue culture plates and infected, challenged, and/or
treated following procedures as described above. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and
washed with motility buffer (10−4 M potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0, with 10−4 M
EDTA) [56]. Cells were then gently collected by scraping with a “policeman” cell scraper, and
subsequent measurements were done in motility buffer, except for the macrophages tested for
acidic treatment, which were measured in either pH 5.8 medium or pH 7.4 medium as a con-
trol. Zeta potential was determined by electrophoretic light scattering at 25˚C with a Zetasizer
(Malvern Panalytical Ltd, Malvern, United Kingdom). Zeta potential was calculated in mV,
and differences between groups were analyzed by Student t test.
Statistics
Galvanotaxis data from representatives of at least 4 independent experiments were routinely
presented as mean ± SE, unless stated otherwise. Distributions of macrophage polarity
between control and neuraminidase treated or between neutral and acidic conditions were
analyzed using χ2 test. Student t test and one-way ANOVA analysis followed by post hoc
Tukey HSD test were used for paired or unpaired comparisons among 2 groups or multiple
groups (more than 2), respectively.

 resistance (S, in which 10 mV equals 1 MO) was generated and recorded prior to each impale-
ment to ensure that the tip was neither broken nor obstructed. In some cases, the TEP of
infected FAEs were measured as follows: first at the epithelial surface (0 μm), then in stepwise
at 50, 100, and 200 μm in depth. The potential typically returns to the baseline of 0 mV after
microelectrode withdrawal (W). (B) Two representative traces and a specific equation used to
calculate TEP value as a modified mean from S1 Data. In the equation, “a” and “b’”are the
early and late values of each impalement in which the electrode was kept in position for at least

S3 Fig. Measuring bioelectric currents using vibrating probes. (A) Schematic of equipment
setup and measuring procedures. Under a dissecting microscope, a probe vibrating between
100 and 200 Hz controlled by a micromanipulator is moved from the reference position (R) to
the measuring position (M), as close as possible (approximately 20 μm) to the epithelial sur-
face, to detect ionic currents. (B) A picture of a vibrating probe approaching an FAE. (C) Rep-
resentative traces of bioelectric current measured at the FAE from Salmonella-infected or
mock-infected control mouse cecum. Probes were calibrated by passing a 1.5 μA cm−2 electric
current through the measuring buffer in either direction (see S1 Data). By convention, flux of
positive charge is used for electric current direction. As in most studies, we used conventional
current flow; therefore outward current density is defined as net positive charge leaving the
epithelial surface and inward current densities as that entering. Hence, positive values repre-
sent net outward current densities, and negative values represent net inward current densities.

men, serial dilution and plating on LB plates. CFUs were calculated by counting bacterial colo-
nies selected with appropriate antibiotics. CFUs lower than the detection limit as indicated by
