IMPORTANCE Cognitive processing therapy (CPT), an evidence-based treatment for
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), has not been tested as an individual treatment among
active-duty military. Group CPT may be an efficient way to deliver treatment.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effects of CPT on PTSD and co-occurring symptoms and
whether they differ when administered in an individual or a group format.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this randomized clinical trial, 268 active-duty
servicemembers consented to assessment at an army medical center from March 8, 2012, to
September 23, 2014, and were randomized to group or individual CPT. Inclusion criteria were
PTSD after military deployment and stable medication therapy. Exclusion criteria consisted of
suicidal or homicidal intent or psychosis. Data collection was completed on June 15, 2015.
Analysis was based on intention to treat.
INTERVENTIONS Participants received CPT (the version excluding written accounts) in
90-minute group sessions of 8 to 10 participants (15 cohorts total; 133 participants) or
60-minute individual sessions (135 participants) twice weekly for 6 weeks. The 12 group and
individual sessions were conducted concurrently.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary measures were scores on the Posttraumatic
Symptom Scale–Interview Version (PSS-I) and the stressor-specific Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder Checklist (PCL-S); secondary measures were scores on the Beck Depression
Inventory–II (BDI-II) and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSSI). Assessments were
completed by independent evaluators masked to treatment condition at baseline and 2
weeks and 6 months after treatment.
RESULTS Among the 268 participants (244 men [91.0%]; 24 women [9.0%]; mean [SD] age,
33.2 [7.4] years), improvement in PTSD severity at posttreatment was greater when CPT was
administered individually compared with the group format (mean [SE] difference on the PSS-I,
−3.7 [1.4]; Cohen d = 0.6; P = .006). Significant improvements were maintained with the
individual (mean [SE] PSS-I, −7.8 [1.0]; Cohen d = 1.3; mean [SE] PCL-S, −12.6 [1.4]; Cohen d = 1.2)
and group (mean [SE] PSS-I, −4.0 [0.97]; Cohen d = 0.7; mean [SE] PCL-S, −6.3 [1.4]; Cohen
d = 0.6) formats, with no differences in remission or severity of PTSD at the 6-month follow-up.
Symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation did not differ significantly between formats.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individual treatment resulted in greater improvement in
PTSD severity than group treatment. Depression and suicidal ideation improved equally with
both formats. However, even among those receiving individual CPT, approximately 50% still
had PTSD and clinically significant symptoms. In the military population, improving existing
treatments such as CPT or developing new treatments is needed.

P
osttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious prob-
lem among active-duty military personnel, especially
those returning from a combat deployment.1-3 How-
ever, little research has been done on the treatment of PTSD
in active-duty military. Cognitive processing therapy (CPT) is
an evidenced-based, trauma-focused cognitive therapy for
PTSD that has been found to be efficacious in civilian and vet-
eran randomized clinical trials,4-8 with long-lasting results for
5 to 10 years among civilians.9 Three meta-analyses10-12 found
that CPT had the largest mean effect size of any PTSD treat-
ment.
Additional data are needed on the efficacy of group and
individual treatment among active-duty military samples. Re-
search on group treatment for PTSD has lagged behind the
study of individual treatment, although groups are used
widely.13 Cognitive processing therapy was developed as a
group treatment,14 and several studies demonstrate its effi-
cacy in this format. A randomized clinical trial in the Demo-
cratic Republic of Congo7 found group CPT to be more effec-
tive than individual support and resources, with large
differencesovertime,althoughtherapistsandparticipantshad
limited education, requiring the protocol be modified. Group
CPT was found to be efficacious in a noninferiority (equiva-
lence) trial comparing in-person and telehealth group treat-
mentamongmaleveterans.8Resicketal15comparedgroupCPT
with group present-centered therapy among active-duty mili-
tarymembersandfoundthatCPTproducedstatisticallygreater
reductions in PTSD and depression, demonstrating that group
CPT can effect improvements in an active-duty population.
However, a meta-analysis by Haagen et al10 concluded that
group therapy alone was inferior to individual therapy and rec-
ommended against its use as a sole treatment. Based on those
findings, the present study with active-duty military com-
pared CPT delivered in group and individual formats, which
to our knowledge has not yet been examined in this popula-
tion.
Methods
Participants
Participants were 268 active-duty US Army soldiers (244 men
and 24 women) 18 years or older seeking treatment for PTSD
at Fort Hood, Texas, after deployments to or near Iraq or Af-
ghanistan (Table 1). Eligibility required experience of a crite-
rion A traumatic event as defined by the DSM-IV-TR16 that oc-
curred during military deployment. However, the diagnosis of
PTSD could have been based on another criterion A event. At
baseline, participants taking psychotropic medications main-
tained a stable regimen for at least 6 weeks. Participants were
asked to keep their medication regimen unchanged through-
out the treatment period in consultation with their prescrib-
ers but could continue other therapy (eTable 1 in Supplement
1). Participants received approval from their unit command-
ers to participate. Minimal exclusion criteria consisted of cur-
rent suicidal or homicidal risk meriting crisis intervention, ac-
tive psychosis or mania, severe traumatic brain injury, and
concurrent PTSD treatment. Participants with comorbid con-
ditions (eg, substance abuse, current mild to moderate post-
concussive syndrome) were not excluded. Figure 1 shows the
CONSORT diagram for specifics of recruitment and participa-
tion; eMethods 1 in Supplement 1 provides a complete list of
reasons for noncompletion. This study was approved by in-
stitutional review boards at Brooke Army Medical Center, San
Antonio, Texas; the University of Texas Health Science Cen-
ter at San Antonio; Duke University, Durham, North Carolina;
and Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Boston, Mass-
chusetts. All participants provided written informed con-
sent. The full study protocol can be found in Supplement 2.
Measures
All interview and self-reported measures were administered
byindependentevaluatorswhoweremaskedtotreatmentcon-
dition. Assessments were scheduled at baseline and at 2 weeks
and6monthsaftertreatment.Adiagnosticassessmentwasper-
formed before randomization with the Posttraumatic Symp-
tom Scale–Interview Version (PSS-I)17 and repeated at fol-
low-up assessments. The PSS-I is a 17-item clinical interview
that evaluates DSM-IV PTSD symptoms on a frequency and se-
verity scale (score range, 0-51, with higher scores indicating
worse symptoms). The stressor-specific Posttraumatic Stress
Disorder Checklist (PCL-S)18 is a self-reported measure of PTSD
symptoms in the past month (range, 17-85; with higher scores
reflecting greater PTSD severity).19 Secondary measures in-
cluded the Beck Depression Inventory–II20 measuring depres-
sive symptoms (range, 0-63, with higher scores indicating
worse depression) and the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation
(BSSI)21 to assess suicidal ideation (using a dichotomous rat-
ing of 0 for absent and 1 for present). For demographics, the
10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Interview
Version (AUDIT)22 assessed baseline alcohol consumption23
(range, 0-40, with a score of 8 or higher indicating hazardous
drinking). Traumatic brain injury was measured by the 3-item
Brief Traumatic Brain Injury Screen, which was scored di-
chotomously as 0 for no and 1 for yes, ongoing postconcus-
sive symptoms.24 The reports of current symptoms are listed
in Table 1. Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview25
modules C (for mania) and K (for psychosis) were adminis-
tered before treatment for possible exclusion.
Key Points
Question Are individual and group cognitive processing therapy
conditions efficacious for treating combat-related posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) in active-duty military?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 268 active-duty
military servicemembers with PTSD, those treated in individual or
group cognitive processing therapy formats improved significantly
with large effect sizes, but individual cognitive processing therapy
produced significantly greater improvement.
Meaning The results provide evidence that cognitive processing
therapy is an effective treatment for combat-related PTSD for
many patients in this setting; however, room for improvement
remains.

Procedures
Participants were recruited from advertisements and direct re-
ferrals from military providers. From March 8, 2012, to Sep-
tember 23, 2014, the STRONG STAR Research Clinic at Fort
Hood, Texas, prescreened more than 1000 individuals for eli-
gibility in 4 concurrently enrolling research studies via tele-
phone. Approximately 280 individuals were ineligible or de-
clined participation in the studies; 424 consented to an
alternate study; and 427 participants consented to this study.
Participants completed an eligibility and baseline assess-
ment, including structured interviews and self-report mea-
sures. Training and fidelity of independent evaluators are de-
scribed in eMethods 2 in Supplement 1.
Computerized block randomization into group or indi-
vidual therapy formats occurred after eligibility was deter-
mined. Groups consisting of 8 to 10 participants (15 cohorts
total) and individual participants were treated concurrently.
Before starting treatment, participants met individually with
the therapist to review their trauma history and confirm the
index event to target initially in treatment. Groups met twice
weekly for 6 weeks for 90-minute sessions. Participants were
dropped from group treatment if they missed 4 treatment ses-

sions but were asked to continue with assessments for inten-
tion-to-treat (ITT) analyses. Individual sessions were 60 min-
utes,scheduledtwiceweekly.Ifindividualscouldnotcomplete
treatment in 3 months for reasons other than military assign-
ments, treatment was ended and follow-up assessments were
attempted. Participants were not paid for their participation.
Adverse events were monitored using a rigorous method simi-
lartothatofmedicationclinicaltrials,anapproachseldomused
in psychotherapy trials.26
Treatment
Cognitive processing therapy is a 12-session, trauma-focused
cognitive therapy in which patients are taught to recognize and
challengedysfunctionalcognitions(termed stuckpoints)about
their traumatic event(s) and current thoughts about them-
selves, others, and the world. Patients learn to label events,
thoughts, and emotions, while therapists help them to exam-
ine the facts and context of the trauma through Socratic
questioning.27 Using progressive worksheets, patients are
taught to examine their thoughts and emotions and develop
morebalancedthinkingabouttraumaticevents.Cognitivepro-
cessing therapy followed the specific manual developed for
military and veterans28,29 and incorporated special consider-
ations for working with active-duty military that are further
described elsewhere.30 In a dismantling study, a cognitive-
only version excluding written trauma accounts was as effec-
tive as CPT with written accounts31; therefore, the cognitive-
only version was used in this study. Training and fidelity of
therapists are described in eMethods 3 in Supplement 1.
Data Analysis
The sample size was originally determined to be 300 to ob-
tain power of 0.80 to detect a relatively small effect size dif-
ference of Cohen d = 0.30 between the 2 treatment groups in
change of PTSD symptom severity. An interim analysis of the
primary outcome was requested for government program-
matic review when 90% had enrolled. The analysis indicated
that the effect was twice as large as originally hypothesized.
The data safety monitoring board was consulted and con-
curred with the decision to terminate the trial at that point.
SAS SEQDESIGN software (SAS Institute Inc) indicated 2-sided
stoppingboundariesof0.039usingthemethodsofO’
Brienand
Fleming32 and 0.035 using the methods of Pocock33 to main-
tain P = .05 for the interim analysis performed when 90% of
the sample was collected. At the time of our interim analysis,
the P values for the primary hypothesis tests as reported in our
results were well below those criteria.
The primary analyses of PSS-I and PCL-S scores used the
ITT sample of all participants who were randomized regard-
less of how many sessions of therapy they received. Com-
pleter analyses were conducted for those participants who
completedatleast9ofthe12treatmentsessions(75%)tomatch
the number of missed sessions allowed in the group format.
Primary hypothesis tests were tests of change between base-
line and posttreatment assessment on the measures of PTSD
severity. Follow-up data bear on stability of treatment effects
but were underpowered owing to smaller sample size. The

were analyzed using general linear mixed regression models
using SAS PROC MIXED software (version 9.3; SAS Institute
Inc), with fixed effects of group and time and their interac-
tion. Proportions of participants in each treatment arm no lon-
ger meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria after treatment and fol-
low-up underwent analysis using a generalized linear
proportions model for binary data (SAS GENMOD with gener-
alized estimating equations; SAS Institute Inc), as was the BSSI
for suicidal ideation. The dependent variable for the BSSI was
a dichotomous classification based on 2 threshold items that
separate those with and without suicidality. Repeated mea-
sures were modeled using an unstructured covariance matrix
based on likelihood criteria (Akaike information criterion).
To supplement estimates of group means, we calculated
thereliablechangeindex(RCI)basedonPSS-IandPCL-Sineach
treatment arm.34,35 The RCI represents an amount of change
expected to happen no more than 5% of the time by chance
fluctuations due to unreliability. The RCI is based on the stan-
dard error of measurement, which is a function of the base-
line SDs (PSS-I, 6.0; PCL-S, 10.5) and α coefficients (PSS-I, .62;
PCL-S, .85). Effect sizes for dimensional scales (Cohen d) are
standardized mean differences using the baseline SDs. Effect
sizes for proportions are the number needed to treat to achieve
1 additional good outcome.
Adverse effects are presented descriptively and exam-
ined statistically as the probability of adverse effects per weeks
assessed using Poisson regression models, with summary
counts of adverse effects as the dependent variable and the log
of weeks assessed as an offset variable.36 In all analyses, clus-
tering effects of patient cohort (group) as a random effect were
exploredinpreliminaryanalyses.Ineverycase,Waldtestswere
nonsignificant and substantive results were unchanged; there-
fore, these random effects were dropped from the final mod-
els. Hypothesis tests were performed at unadjusted P = .05 in-
dicating significance.
Results
Posttreatment PTSD Severity and Diagnosis on the PSS-I
The study population included 268 active-duty servicemem-
bers (244 men [91.0%]; 24 women [9.0%]; mean [SD] age, 33.2
[7.4] years). Table 2 lists the results for the ITT analyses for all
outcomes, and eTable 2 in Supplement 1 includes complete
analyses. Figure 2 depicts findings for the PSS-I and the PCL-S.
On the PSS-I (condition × time interaction, F2,266 = 3.98;
P = .02), patients in both formats improved, with individual
patients improving about twice as much as group patients at
2-week posttreatment assessment. The estimated propor-
tions (SEs) no longer meeting PSS-I diagnostic criteria for PTSD
after treatment did not differ significantly between treat-
ment conditions (49% [5%] in individual CPT and 37% [5%]
in group CPT; number needed to treat, 8.3).
Posttreatment PTSD Severity on the PCL-S
Participants receiving individual CPT improved more and did
so more rapidly (condition × time interaction, F2,266 = 5.42;
P = .005), but both treatment arms improved significantly on
the PCL-S (group treatment, −6.3 [SE, 1.4]; Cohen d = 0.6; in-
dividual treatment, −12.6 [SE, 1.4]; Cohen d = 1.2). Table 2 pre-
sents the mixed model results. Change from before to after

Posttreatment RCI
Treatment condition differences were significant. In the ITT
analysis, reliable change on the PSS-I occurred in an esti-
mated 43% of patients receiving individual treatment and 17%
of patients receiving group treatment (χ2
1 = 15.0; P < .001). On
the PCL-S, an estimated 52% of patients receiving individual
treatment vs 30% of patients receiving group treatment had
reliable change (χ2
1 = 8.9; P = .003) (Table 2).

large effect sizes in individual treatment and moderate to large
improvements in group treatment. Outcomes at the 6-month
follow-up were very similar to the posttreatment results. The
differences between the outcomes at posttreatment (Table 2)

cant, with a mean P value of .43 (range, .15-.85), a mean Co-
hen d of 0.16 (range, 0.02-0.3), and a mean NNT of 27 (range,

sizes were both smaller at follow-up, and only the between-

on the PSS-I was statistically significant (17% [SE, 8%]; unad-
justed P = .02).
Depression and Suicidality
Depression measured by the Beck Depression Inventory–II
improved significantly in both treatment arms (overall
effect of time, F2,266 = 30.95; P < .001). Within-condition
effect sizes were Cohen d = 0.8 from pretreatment to the
2-week posttreatment assessments and Cohen d = 0.8 from
pretreatment to the 6-month follow-up assessment for indi-
vidual CPT compared with Cohen d = 0.5 and Cohen d = 0.7
for group CPT, respectively. Improvements were stable,
with neither condition changing significantly between the
2-week posttreatment and 6-month assessments in both
treatment arms (eTable 3 in Supplement 1). None of the tests
of differences between treatment arms produced statisti-
cally significant results. The proportions with suicidality
(BSSI) dropped in both treatment arms during treatment
(overall effect of time, χ 2
2 = 13.0; P = .002), but between-
condition differences were small and nonsignificant. Com-
plete results are included in eTable 3 in Supplement 1.
Treatment Completers
The completer analyses are presented in eTable 4 in
Supplement 1 for all 4 outcome measures. The results are simi-
lar to the ITT findings.
Adverse Events
Seventeen psychological events were judged by participants
to be at least possibly related to the study, and these occurred
because of increased symptoms evoked by baseline assess-
ment procedures (4 patients) or the trauma focus of therapy
(7 patients in group CPT and 6 patients in individual CPT). Dur-
ing the study, 2 unsuccessful suicide attempts occurred in pa-
tients randomized to group CPT (1 before the start of treat-
ment and 1 during treatment); neither was judged to be study
related as per participant report. More detail about adverse
events, which were primarily injuries and illnesses, are pro-
vided in eMethods 4 in Supplement 1.
Discussion
Individual CPT was more efficacious than group CPT at reduc-
ing PTSD severity. Patients in both treatment conditions ex-
perienced significant decreases in PTSD symptoms over time,
with large effect sizes for individual therapy and medium ef-
fect sizes for group therapy, but patients randomized to indi-
vidual CPT had approximately twice as much improvement
(PSS-I:Cohend = 0.6).TheconditionsalsodifferedonRCI,with
significantly more patients in individual treatment meeting
those criteria. The loss-of-diagnosis findings were compa-
rable to or better than most veteran studies of CPT, but group
and individual treatment did not differ significantly.4,5,8,37
Several possible explanations exist for why group CPT did
not perform as well as individual CPT. First, participants in
group CPT who missed sessions lost content that could not be
replaced, whereas participants in individual therapy were able
torescheduleifneeded.Second,becausepatientsreceivedless
individual attention in the group setting, those who had dif-
ficulties with content may not have received sufficient sup-
port. Conversely, in the individual treatment condition, full at-
tention is given throughout the sessions, which also facilitates
the ability to address multiple traumatic events and ensures
understanding and deeper Socratic questioning about mul-
tiple events. Third, patients in group sessions may feel less ac-
countable for completing practice assignments, perhaps re-
sulting in reduced engagement with treatment.
We found no significant differences between conditions
for depression in the ITT analysis, but patients in both therapy
formats improved, with large effect sizes for individually
treated participants and medium effects for group-treated pa-
tients for depression and significant reductions in suicidality.
Although mean depression scores improved from the severe
range, the mean depression scores at the posttreatment as-
sessment still reflect moderate depressive symptoms. The
sample demonstrated complicated co-occurring conditions,
with 173 (64.6%) reporting current postconcussive symp-
toms and 45 (16.8%) reporting hazardous levels of drinking at
thepretreatmentassessment,whichcouldcontributetosymp-
toms and outcomes. These factors often lead to exclusion from
other clinical trials.
Cognitive processing therapy did not increase suicidal ide-
ationontheBSSIorreportedadverseeffectsdespitethetrauma
focus. In fact, the BSSI showed a significant and steady de-
creaseinsuicidalideationinbothtreatmentformats.Thisfind-
ing should help to alleviate concerns that engagement in
trauma-focusedtreatmentmightincreasesuicidalideationand
even suggests that PTSD treatment may reduce suicidality in
active-duty military members.38
Limitations
Several limitations to the study should be noted. Although the
voluntary dropout rate before or during treatment was low (47
[17.5%]), 33 patients (12.3%) were lost to treatment owing to
military discontinuation and high attrition in data collection
in the subsequent 6 months that may not be found in less mo-
bile populations. The within-condition results did not change
significantly from the posttreatment to 6-month follow-up as-
sessments; thus, the smaller sample size and less power in part
accounts for the lack of statistical differences between condi-
tions at the 6-month follow-up. Also, the small number of
womenenrolledinthestudypreventedexaminationofsexdif-
ferences. Women may have responded differently than men,
although further research is needed.
Our finding that individual treatment is more efficacious
than the group-only format with regard to PTSD is consistent
with a recent meta-analysis10 that reported effect sizes of 1.2
for individual and 0.6 for group therapy, virtually identical to
those found herein. Those authors concluded that group-
only formats should not be used for PTSD. However, given that
an effect size of 0.7 is a medium to large effect, ruling out group
treatment for everyone may be premature.
Our results are also consistent with another recent re-
view of primarily veteran samples reporting statistically large
improvements with evidence-based treatments for the “aver-

age” patient but high treatment nonresponse rates for many
individuals.39 We found large mean changes in PTSD severity
in individually treated patients; however, even among those
who completed treatment, approximately half still had PTSD
and many still had clinically significant symptoms after treat-
ment. Our findings thus contribute to the growing literature
suggesting that combat-related PTSD is complex and difficult
to treat with existing therapies. Like treatments for most dis-
orders, CPT did not work for everyone. We therefore agree that
more effort is required to treat deployment-related PTSD ef-
fectively in active-duty military members.
Future research should focus on specific issues found in
military populations that may affect PTSD treatment. Areas in-
viting study include the roles of comorbidities, such as con-
current depression, substance abuse, traumatic brain injury,
and sleep disorders; the potential effect of moral injury (an
event that conflicts with deeply held morals and beliefs) re-
sulting from combat trauma; and high rates of witnessing or
dealing with the aftermath of deaths of others, including grue-
some deaths of friends. Other treatments, adjunctive therapy,
and treatment matching should also be examined, as well as
whether varying lengths of treatment may be more
beneficial.40,41
Conclusions
Cognitive processing therapy delivered in an individual format
was more efficacious in treating symptoms of PTSD compared
with CPT delivered in a group format. Significant reductions in
PTSD were maintained during a 6-month follow-up. To our
knowledge, these findings are the strongest to date with regard
to existing treatments for PTSD in active-duty military and vet-
erans, but more work is required to improve outcomes.
