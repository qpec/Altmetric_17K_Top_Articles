ABSTRACT
The independent relationship between physical inactivity and risk of death after an index
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hospitalisation is unknown.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study in a large integrated healthcare system. Patients were included
if they were hospitalised for COPD between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011. All-cause mortality in
the 12 months after discharge was the primary outcome. Physical activity, expressed as self-reported
minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), was routinely assessed at outpatient visits prior
to hospitalisation. 1727 (73%) patients were inactive (0 min of MVPA per week), 412 (17%) were
insufficiently active (1–149 min of MVPA per week) and 231 (10%) were active (⩾150 min of MVPA per
week). Adjusted Cox regression models assessed risk of death across the MVPA categories.
Among 2370 patients (55% females and mean age 73±11 years), there were 464 (20%) deaths. Patients
who were insufficiently active or active had a 28% (adjusted HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.54–0.97), p=0.03) and 47%
(adjusted HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.34–0.84), p<0.01) lower risk of death, respectively, in the 12 months
following an index COPD hospitalisation compared to inactive patients.
Any level of MVPA is associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality after a COPD hospitalisation.
Routine assessment of physical activity in clinical care would identify persons at high risk for dying after
COPD hospitalisation.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
COPD
 Introduction
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterised by acute exacerbations which result in
poorer health-related quality of life, a faster decline in lung function and increased mortality [1–4].
Hospitalisations due to severe acute exacerbations account for up to 70% of the direct healthcare costs in
COPD [5, 6]. Furthermore, COPD is the third most common cause of readmission among Medicare
beneficiaries [7]. Re-hospitalisation and death rates are as high as 25% and 21%, respectively, at 1 year in
patients who have been hospitalised for an acute exacerbations [8].
The ability to identify individuals at risk for re-hospitalisation and death after hospital admission for an
acute exacerbation would allow targeting of high-risk patients for treatment and intervention. Emphasis
has focused on identifying modifiable patient, provider and system factors [9]. Although studies have
different lengths of follow-up time and differ as to COPD-related versus all-cause outcomes, they have
consistently shown older age, male sex, more severe airflow obstruction, dyspnoea, oxygen use, prior
hospitalisations and comorbidities to be key patient factors predicting re-hospitalisations and death [8,
10–14]. While several of these variables are already targeted by pharmacological therapy, there is a need to
identify other modifiable patient factors.
Physical activity has emerged as a modifiable behaviour that is associated with COPD outcomes. The
Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guidelines recommend regular physical activity for
patients with stable COPD [15]. Higher levels of physical activity are associated with shorter hospital
length of stay [16] and decreased risk of acute exacerbations, hospitalisations and death, independent of
airflow obstruction [17–21]. In studies looking specifically at persons who had an index COPD
hospitalisation, self-reported low physical activity using a research questionnaire [18] and directly
measured physical activity using an accelerometer [22] were associated with an increased risk of
COPD-related re-hospitalisation [18]. We similarly found that self-reported physical inactivity, assessed
during routine clinical care, was associated with a 34% greater risk of 30-day all-cause readmission after an
index COPD hospitalisation [23].
Although physical activity level in stable COPD is associated with mortality [24], the relationship between
physical activity and risk of death in a high-risk group of patients after an index COPD hospitalisation is
unknown. Therefore, our primary aim was to examine the independent relationship between physical
activity and all-cause mortality in the 12 months after an index COPD hospitalisation. We hypothesise
that higher physical activity at baseline predicts lower risk of all-cause mortality after a COPD
hospitalisation. As a secondary aim, we also assessed the independent relationship between physical
activity and a composite outcome of all-cause mortality and re-hospitalisation.
Methods
Study design
This was a retrospective cohort study of patients from an integrated healthcare system with 14 medical centres
located in southern California. Subject approval was obtained from the Kaiser Permanente Southern
California Institutional Review Board (Pasadena, CA, USA). Patients were included if they were hospitalised
for COPD and discharged between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011. COPD hospitalisations were
defined according to the Centres for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and National Quality Forum
proposed criteria: International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision principal diagnosis of COPD
(491.21, 491.22, 491.8, 491.9, 492.8, 493.20, 493.21, 493.22, and 496) or principal diagnosis of respiratory
failure (518.81, 518.82, 518.84 and 799.1) and a secondary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD (491.21,
491.22, 493.21 and 493.22) [25, 26]. We applied the following additional inclusion criteria: age ⩾40 years,
prescribed a bronchodilator or corticosteroid inhaler in the 12 months prior to the index hospitalisation, alive
at discharge, continuously enrolled in the health plan in the 12 months prior to the index hospitalisation, and
having physical activity data. All participants were followed for 12 months post discharge or until death.
Outcomes
Primary: death
All-cause mortality in the 12 months after discharge from the index hospitalisation was the primary
outcome. Mortality data were obtained from the state and national death indices which provides near
complete capture of the date and cause of death. Patients who were re-hospitalised and died during or at
any time after the re-hospitalisation were included in the deceased cohort.
Secondary: composite of death and re-hospitalisation
All-cause re-hospitalisation in the 12 months after discharge from the index hospitalisation and death as
described above was a secondary outcome. Information on re-hospitalisations was obtained from utilisation
or claims data for admissions to Kaiser Permanente medical centres or contracted hospitals, respectively.

 Primary independent variable: physical activity
An exercise vital sign is assessed at all outpatient visits. The exercise vital sign has been previously shown to
have construct and predictive validity [23, 27, 28]. Patients are asked two questions regarding their regular
physical activity: 1) on average, how many days per week do you engage in moderate to strenuous (vigorous)
exercise (like a brisk walk)?; and 2) on average, how many minutes do you engage in exercise at this level?
These questions are typically asked by medical assistants. Patients’ responses are entered into the electronic
medical record. Response choices for number of days are categorical (0–7). Minutes are also recorded
categorically: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, 120 and ⩾150. The electronic medical record software multiplies
the two responses to display total minutes per week of moderate or vigorous physical activity (MVPA).
We categorised patients as inactive (0 min of MVPA per week), insufficiently active (1–149 min of MVPA
per week) or active (⩾150 min of MVPA per week) according to national physical activity recommendations
[29]. We used the exercise vital sign value closest to but prior to the index hospitalisation (median (range) 30
(1–350) days prior to the index hospitalisation). An indicator for time elapsed from exercise vital sign
assessment to the index hospitalisation was included in the models to account for the variable timing of the
exercise vital sign assessment. We also examined three different summary values of the exercise vital sign:
any level of MVPA closest to the index hospitalisation and the median/mode, and highest values of all
available exercise vital sign data in the 12 months preceding the index hospitalisation since the two latter
values are less influenced by the timing of the exercise vital sign assessment in our sensitivity analyses.
Covariates
We extracted administrative and clinical data in the 12 months (January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010)
prior to the index hospitalisation.
Socio-demographics
We assessed age, sex, marital status, race and insurance status. Education and household income were
described at the level of the census tract since this information was not routinely collected in the electronic
medical record as part of clinical care.
Comorbidities
Body mass index was obtained from the outpatient visit closest but prior to the index hospitalisation.
A Charlson comorbidity score was calculated for each patient [30]. We also examined the presence of
anaemia, anxiety, depression and pulmonary hypertension prior to the index hospitalisation, which have
been associated with hospitalisation risk in COPD but are not included in the Charlson index [31].
Health resource utilisation
We examined the number of hospitalisations in the 12 months preceding the index hospitalisation. Length
of stay, receipt of inpatient palliative care and discharge disposition were all obtained with the index
hospitalisation. Pharmacy and durable medical equipment data provided information on use of inhaled
bronchodilators, long-term systemic corticosteroids and supplemental oxygen in the 12 months prior to
the index hospitalisation. New oxygen use after the index discharge was also assessed.
Health behaviours
Cigarette smoking status was obtained from the outpatient visit closest to the index hospitalisation.
Immunisation history included influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations in the previous 1–2 years and
5 years, respectively. Any participation in pulmonary rehabilitation during the 3 years prior to the index
hospitalisation was recorded.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons across MVPA categories were performed using a non-parametric Kruskal–Wallis test for
continuous variables which were not normally distributed and Chi-squared tests for categorical variables.
Cox proportional hazards regression models compared mortality risk across three levels of MVPA
(inactive, insufficiently active and active) in the 12 months after a COPD-related hospitalisation. Covariates
were examined in unadjusted models and were included in the final adjusted model if they contributed
substantially to model fit or were considered clinically important. Kaplan–Meier curves were created to
display survival, according to the three levels of MVPA during the 12-month follow-up. An adjusted
competing risk model of cause-specific hazard was generated to determine the association between level of
physical activity and cause of death (COPD-related versus all other causes). Cox regression was also used
for the secondary composite outcome of death and re-hospitalisation.
Several sensitivity analyses were performed by: 1) including only patients who had spirometry data (n=1292)
to adjust for disease severity; 2) excluding a subgroup of patients who were never-smokers (n=291) to assess

 for misclassification of COPD diagnosis; and 3) using three different summary values of the exercise vital
sign (any level of MVPA closest to the index hospitalisation, mode/median exercise vital sign or highest
exercise vital sign in the 12 months prior to the index hospitalisation). All tests were two-sided with a
p-value <0.05 considered statistically significant. Analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Cohort selection and patient characteristics
We identified 3440 patients with COPD as their principal discharge diagnosis or who had acute
respiratory failure with a secondary diagnosis of acute exacerbation of COPD from January 1, 2011 to
December 31, 2011 (figure 1). The final analytical sample included 2370 patients.
A total of 1727 (73%) persons were inactive, 412 (17%) insufficiently active, and 231(10%) active. Patients
had 8.4±7.0 outpatient visits with exercise vital sign data in the 12 months prior to the index
hospitalisation. Baseline socio-demographic and clinical characteristics stratified by level of baseline
physical activity prior to the index hospitalisation are presented in table 1. Patients who were physically
inactive were older, single, had lower education, were obese, were less likely to participate in rehabilitation,

 used supplemental oxygen, had worse airflow obstruction and more comorbidities, and were more likely to
have a COPD hospitalisation in the previous year compared to active patients (p<0.05).
There were 464 (20%) deaths and 1028 (43%) re-hospitalisations that did not result in death over
12 months (table 2). A majority of the deaths (74%) were preceded by a re-hospitalisation and
approximately half of the deaths occurred within 60 days of the re-hospitalisation. COPD was the primary
cause of death (46%), followed by malignancies (21%) and cardiovascular disease (15%).
Primary outcome
Unadjusted analyses of the relationship between MVPA with all-cause mortality
Patients meeting the national recommendation of engaging in at least 150 min·week−1 of MVPA had a
65% lower risk of death in the 12 months following an index COPD hospitalisation compared to inactive
patients (HR 0.35 (95% CI 0.22–0.55), p<0.001) (table 3). Those who were insufficiently active
(1–149 min·week−1 of MVPA) had a 46% lower risk of dying compared to inactive patients (HR 0.54 (95%
CI 0.40–0.72), p<0.001).
Multivariate adjusted analyses of the relationship between MVPA and all-cause mortality

 hospitalisation, and previous exposure to pulmonary rehabilitation), patients who reported being
insufficiently active or active had a significantly lower risk of death compared to inactive patients (table 3
and figure 2). Specifically, active patients had a 47% lower risk of death in the 12 months following an
index COPD hospitalisation compared to inactive patients (HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.34–0.84), p<0.01). Those
who were insufficiently active had a 28% lower risk of dying compared to inactive patients (HR 0.72 (95%
CI 0.54–0.97), p=0.03). Other significant predictors of mortality in the adjusted model included older age,
being underweight, being a current smoking, taking chronic corticosteroids, Charlson index score of ⩾3,
pulmonary hypertension, longer length of stay, inpatient palliative care and discharge to hospice. Being
female, overweight or obese and previous participation in rehabilitation remained protective.
Multivariate adjusted competing risk-cause of death analysis
There was a significant relationship between level of MVPA and COPD-related cause of death (p=0.02)
after adjustment for a similar set of covariates as the main model above. Specifically, patients who were
inactive had almost a four-fold higher risk of dying of COPD-related causes compared to active patients
(HR 3.8 (95% CI 1.41–10.42)). Patients who were insufficiently active had a three times higher risk of
dying due to COPD compared to active patients (HR 3.0 (95% CI 1.02–8.64)).
Secondary outcome: composite of death and re-hospitalisation
MVPA was significantly associated with death and re-hospitalisation in the 12 months following an index
COPD hospitalisation in both unadjusted and adjusted models, though the effects were smaller compared
to the main model with death as the only primary outcome (table 4). Additional factors in the multivariate
model that were significantly associated with increased risk of death or re-hospitalisation included being
underweight, using systemic corticosteroids, previous hospitalisation, Charlson index score of ⩾2,
pulmonary hypertension, longer length of stay during the index hospitalisation and being discharged to
a hospice.
Sensitivity analyses
In the subset of patients with spirometry data, the model that adjusted for forced expiratory volume in 1 s
% pred showed that the magnitude of the risk of death was similar to the main model for the active patients
(HR 0.53 (95% CI 0.28–1.01), p=0.06) and attenuated for the insufficiently active patients (HR 0.88 (95%
CI 0.60–1.28), p=0.50), compared to inactive patients (table 5). In this sensitivity analysis we found that
forced expiratory volume in 1 s % pred was a marginally significant predictor of death (p=0.06). When we
excluded a subgroup of patients who were never-smokers we found that the risk of death was similar to the
main model (active: HR 0.57 (95% CI 0.35–0.90), p=0.02; insufficiently active: HR 0.71 (95% CI 0.52–0.97),
p=0.03). Using three different summary values of exercise vital sign, we found risks for death similar to the
main model: any MVPA versus no MVPA (HR 0.66 (95% CI 0.51–0.85), p<0.001); mode/median (active:
HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.37–1.03), p=0.07; insufficiently active: HR 0.61 (95% CI 0.43–0.88), p<0.01) and highest
(active: HR 0.59 (95% CI 0.47–0.76), p<0.001; insufficiently active: HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.55–0.85), p=0.001).
Discussion
Patients with COPD-related hospitalisation who engaged in any level of MVPA prior to the index
hospitalisation had a 28–47% lower risk of dying over the subsequent 12 months compared to patients
who performed no MVPA. Higher levels of MVPA were significantly associated with a lower risk of dying
from COPD but not with other causes of death, with any amount of MVPA being beneficial. We have
shown that patient self-reporting physical activity using two simple questions, which can be easily assessed
in routine care, has predictive value. Our findings demonstrate the importance of routinely assessing

 physical activity in clinical care to identify high-risk patients, as well as the need to conduct prospective
controlled studies to determine if interventions to increase MVPA improve survival in patients who have
been hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation.
Although physical activity has been shown to be a predictor of death in stable outpatient cohorts [17, 18,
20, 24], this is the first study to our knowledge demonstrating low physical activity to be an independent
predictor of death in a high-risk cohort hospitalised for an acute exacerbation. Our results also provide an
estimate of the magnitude of the risk for death in inactive persons with COPD after a hospitalisation.
These findings are pragmatic in informing specific clinical recommendations to patients and have high
clinical relevance.
It is important to note that nearly 75% of the deaths were preceded by a hospitalisation for COPD or
other causes. When we examined death and re-hospitalisation as a composite outcome, we found that
MVPA remained a strong independent predictor. While our findings suggest that physical activity level is
another useful predictor of mortality, engagement in any level of MVPA and thus maintenance of a
physically active lifestyle in this population could potentially buffer the physical and emotional stresses of
repeated hospitalisations due to COPD or other causes. The physiological processes underlying the
relationship between physical activity and COPD outcomes are complex and only partially understood.
However, it has been hypothesised that physical inactivity leads to cellular and molecular dysregulation
[32] via increased inflammatory processes [33–36], which directly contributes to the development and
progression of multiple comorbidities [37, 38]. A recent longitudinal study that monitored physical activity
for 3 years in stable patients with COPD found that, independent of disease severity, patients who were
persistently inactive had greater declines in functional capacity and fat-free mass compared to those who
engaged in some level of physical activity [39].
We also identified other lifestyle factors such as active cigarette smoking, no participation in pulmonary
rehabilitation and poor nutritional status (represented by low body mass index) as independent predictors
of death. Our study emphasises the need for continued multidisciplinary interventions to improve
outcomes by promoting long-term behaviour change. Other significant independent predictors of death,
such as older age, male sex, use of systemic corticosteroids, history of prior hospitalisations [8, 40], greater
numbers of comorbidities [8, 10], pulmonary hypertension [8] and longer length of stay [8] are consistent
with previous studies.
The strengths of our study include a relatively well-characterised, large, contemporary, racially diverse and
sex balanced sample, and the use of physical activity data that are routinely captured during clinical
practice, complete capture of utilisation and claims data, and estimates of the effects of physical activity on
death that remain robust to sensitivity analyses.
There are several limitations to this study. Since physical activity was self-reported during routine outpatient
encounters, it is possible that patients may have been experiencing an exacerbation when the exercise vital
sign data were collected or that, for patients who were later hospitalised, the closest exercise vital sign data
already reflected the diminished physical activity associated with their current illness. However, our risk
estimates remained robust despite adjustments for the time between the index hospitalisation and exercise
vital sign assessment and using different summary values of exercise vital sign that are less affected by
timing of the assessment. In addition, we recognise that the classification of MVPA according to the

argue against any significant misclassification. We adhered to the CMS definition of hospitalisation for
COPD exacerbations in order to be as generalisable as possible, to allow comparison with other studies and
to most accurately reflect real-world settings. Because of the retrospective, observational design that relied
on the availability of existing data, we may not have accurately captured all variables of interest, e.g.
symptom severity and exercise capacity, and we are not able to make strong inferences about causation.
Conclusions
Using a routine simple exercise vital sign, patients who report engagement in any level of MVPA are at
lower risk of dying in the 12 months following an index COPD hospitalisation, compared to those who are
physically inactive. Assessment of physical activity should be routinely performed in clinical care to
identify high-risk patients.
