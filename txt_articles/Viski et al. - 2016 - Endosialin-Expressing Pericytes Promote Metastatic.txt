Abstract
Metastasis is a multistep process that is critically dependent
on the interaction of metastasizing tumor cells with cells in the
local microenvironment. Within this tumor stroma, vessel-
associated pericytes and myofibroblasts share a number of
traits, including the upregulated expression of the transmem-
brane receptor endosialin (CD248). Comparative experiments
in wild-type and endosialin-deficient mice revealed that stro-
mal endosialin does not affect primary tumor growth but
strongly promotes spontaneous metastasis. Mechanistically,
endosialin-expressing pericytes in the primary tumor facilitate
distant site metastasis by promoting tumor cell intravasation in
a cell contact–dependent manner, resulting in elevated numbers
of circulating tumor cells. Corresponding to these preclinical
experiments, in independent cohorts of primary human breast
cancers, upregulated endosialin expression significantly correlates
with increased metastasis and poorer patient survival. Together,
the data demonstrate a critical role for endosialin-expressing
primary tumor pericytes in mediating metastatic dissemination
and identify endosialin as a promising therapeutic target in breast
cancer. Cancer Res; 76(18); 5313–25. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
The vast majority of cancer-related mortality is due to distant
site metastasis and not to primary tumor growth. Metastasis
thereby marks the transition from a local to a systemic disease.
The multistep nature of metastatic tumor cell dissemination and
colonization is widely appreciated (1). Yet, the molecular and
mechanistic understanding of individual steps of the metastatic
cascade and the identification of bottlenecks that could serve as
therapeutic targets is still in its infancy.
Metastatic progression is critically dependent on the inter-
action of metastasizing tumor cells with the cells of their micro-
environment, both at the primary tumor site as well as at the site
of metastasis (2, 3). Among the cells of the tumor microenviron-
ment, stromal myofibroblasts, macrophages, and other inflam-
matory cells, as well as cellular constituents of blood and lym-
phatic vessels, i.e., endothelial cells, pericytes and vascular smooth
muscle cells, comprise the tumor stroma (4, 5). Interestingly,
tumor-associated pericytes and stromal myofibroblasts share a
number of functional and molecular traits including the expres-
sion of the cell surface receptor endosialin (CD248).
Endosialin (CD248) is a transmembrane glycoprotein (6)
that was originally described as a cell surface marker of the
tumor endothelium (7, 8). However, high-resolution morpho-
logic analyses of a range of human cancers have unequivocally
demonstrated that endosialin is not expressed by endothelial
cells, but by pericytes and myofibroblasts (9–13). Importantly,
resting mesenchymal cells in the healthy adult have low or
undetectable levels of endosialin expression. Expression is
essentially restricted to activated cells of the mesenchymal
lineage during embryogenesis (10, 14) as well as during path-
ologic states including tumor progression and metastasis
(13, 15, 16), making endosialin an oncofetal protein with
potential as a biomarker and a therapeutic target (17–20). In
fact, clinical trials in solid tumors and lymphomas with an
endosialin-targeting antibody are ongoing (www.clinicaltrials.
gov/ct2/results?term¼endosialin&Search¼Search; ref. 21).
Functionally, endosialin regulates mesenchymal cell prolif-
eration through PDGFRb signaling (22, 23), which has been
associated with the promigratory mesenchymal cell phenotype
(24–26). Endosialin-deficient mice are, unless pathologically
challenged, phenotypically normal (27), although they display
some delay of developmental vascular remodeling caused by
perturbed pericyte function (28, 29). Earlier studies have
reported no overt difference in the growth of subcutaneous
tumors in wild-type and endosialin-deficient mice (27, 28, 30).
Yet, transplantable colorectal tumors grown orthotopically
in endosialin-deficient mice displayed a prominent reduction
in primary tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis compared

 with endosialin wild-type tumor-bearing mice (27). This strik-
ing difference between subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor
growth in endosialin-deficient mice prototypically highlights
the important contribution of the microenvironment to tumor
progression and metastasis and identifies endosialin as a func-
tionally relevant receptor in the tumor stroma. At the same
time, pericytes have been shown to limit metastasis in the
Rip1Tag2 model of pancreatic b-cell tumorigenesis (31). Con-
ceptually linking these two totally independent lines of
research, we hypothesized that the upregulated expression of
endosialin by tumor-associated pericytes may be an important
contributor to tumor progression and metastasis. We conse-
quently set out to systematically dissect the role of endosialin in
the control of individual steps of the metastatic cascade. These
experiments yielded unexpected mechanistic insights into the
role of endosialin in regulating metastasis and identified the
control of tumor cell intravasation by activated pericytes as a
critical and rate-limiting step.
Materials and Methods
In vivo studies
In vivo experiments were carried out under a UK Home Office
Project license 70/7413 or under ethical guidelines of the local
Animal Use and Care Committees approved by the Regier-
ungspr€
asidium in Karlsruhe, Germany [35-9185.81/G-195/10].
Animals were housed in barriers at the animal facility of the DKFZ
or in Optimice cages at the ICR. All animals were monitored on a
daily basis for signs of ill health and had free admission to food
and water. 129/Sv mice with a global knockout of endosialin were
kindly provided by Dr. David Huso (Johns Hopkins Medical
Institutions, Baltimore, MD; ref. 27). Mice were backcrossed for
six generations with either BALB/c (Charles River), Swiss nude
mice (Charles River), or C57BL/6 (DKFZ) mice. Genotypes were
confirmed by PCR.
For spontaneous metastasis assays, 4T1 tumor cells were
injected into the mammary fat pad or subcutaneously in 6–
10 weeks old female WT or ENKO BALB/c or Swiss nude mice.
LLC cells were implanted subcutaneously in the flank of 8–10
weeks old WT or ENKO C57BL/6 mice. Tumor size was mon-
itored by IVIS imaging. Tumor volume was calculated as 0.5 �
length � width2.
For 4T1 or LLC tumor resection, primary tumors were removed
under general anesthesia. Mice with tumors not effectively
removed or with subsequent tumor recurrence were removed
from analyses. Mice were sacrificed at the indicated time points
or when they showed signs of ill health.
Protocols for tissue processing, vascular leakage, and hypoxia
assessment are described in the Supplementary Data.
Ex vivo culture of circulating tumor cells
Arterial blood was isolated by cardiac puncture and 100 mL
plated in DMEM plus 10% FCS per 10-cm tissue culture plate.
Tumor cell colonies were stained 14 days later with crystal violet.
Plates were scanned at 300 dpi on EpsonV700 scanner and
analyzed by Adobe Photoshop CS6.

DMEM or RPMI (Invitrogen) plus 10% FCS (Invitrogen). Lewis
lung carcinoma cells (LLC; obtained from ATCC, 2006) were
cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. Human MDA-MB-231-LM2 expressing luciferase
and GFP (MDA-MB213-Luc-GFP; provided by Dr. C. Lowry,
DKFZ, 2014) cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% FCS, 1%

November 2015, tested by ScienCell via immunofluore-
scence and PCR) and 10T1/2 cells (ATCC, 1997) were
cultured in pericyte medium (ScienCell) plus 2% FCS, 1%
of the corresponding pericyte growth supplement (PGS), and
1% penicillin/streptomycin, according to the manufacturer's
protocol. BPs were infected with pGIPZ lentiviral vectors
(Dharmacon) containing control (shNT, GIPZ shRNA empty
vector; RHS4349) or endosialin-targeting (shEN: V2LHS_
34217) shRNAs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
10. 10T1/2 cells were infected with MISSION shRNA lenti-
virus particles (Sigma) encoding nontargeting (SHC002V)
endosialin targeting (shEN; TRC0000098115) shRNAs at a
MOI of 5. Cells were selected in puromycin. Primary mouse
brain pericytes were isolated as described previously (32). All
cell lines were routinely tested for mycoplasma by PCR and
tested negative.

Results
Stromal expression of endosialin does not affect primary tumor
growth but promotes spontaneous metastasis
To investigate the role of stromal endosialin on tumor metas-
tasis, we compared growth and metastatic progression of ortho-
topic syngeneic 4T1 mammary tumors in BALB/c wild-type (WT)
and endosialin-deficient (ENKO) mice. Confocal microscopy and
gene expression profiling of 4T1 tumors revealed that endosialin
expression on the tumor vasculature was restricted to pericytes
with no detectable expression on endothelial cells (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S1A and S1B; original data deposited in the Gene
Expression Omnibus database; accession no. GSE84008). No
significant differences in primary tumor growth were detected
(Fig. 1A), nor in primary tumor weight at necroscopy (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2A). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in
spontaneous metastasis in ENKO compared with WT mice, as
monitored by tumor burden in the lungs (Fig. 1B and C).
Metastatic progression was limited in these experiments by the
growth of the primary tumor. To circumvent this limitation and
better mimic the clinical setting, 4T1 primary tumors were sur-
gically resected at small size (day 9; �100 mm3) and metastatic
progression was traced until mice were culled for ethical reasons
or the experiment terminated. Consistent with the data in Fig. 1A,
there was no significant difference in the weight of the primary
tumors at resection (Supplementary Fig. S2B). However, only
30.7% of WT mice, compared with 70.0% of ENKO mice, survived
to termination of the experiment (day 93, Fig. 1D). Examination
of lung metastatic burden revealed a significantly reduced number
of pulmonary tumor nodules in ENKO compared with WT mice
(Fig. 1E). Of note, surviving mice at the end of the experiment had
no detectable metastatic disease in the lungs.
To exclude possible adaptive immunity–related effects in the
observed metastasis phenotype, we next performed 4T1 metas-
tasis experiments in Swiss nude WT and ENKO immunocom-
promised mice. Again, there was no significant difference in
primary tumor growth (Fig. 1F and G and Supplementary Fig.
S2C). However, metastatic burden as monitored by ex vivo IVIS
imaging was significantly reduced in ENKO mice (Fig. 1H).
Moreover, IVIS imaging of individual organs revealed a signif-
icant reduction in metastasis not just to the lungs, but also to
liver, lymph nodes, spleen, brain, and bone (Fig. 1H and I and
Supplementary Fig. S2D–S2I), indicating that the decrease in
metastasis in BALB/c ENKO mice was not dependent on an
intact immune system.
To validate the 4T1 metastasis phenotype in a second tumor
model, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were grown subcutane-
ously in C57BL/6 WT and ENKO mice and tumors were surgically
resected at day 16 (�300 mm3). As with the 4T1 tumors, endo-
sialin expression in the LLC tumor vasculature was restricted to
pericytes (Supplementary Fig. S1C). There was no significant
difference in primary tumor growth (Fig. 2A), but there was a
significant reduction in the number of ENKO mice with histolog-
ically detectable metastases in the lungs upon termination of the
experiment (day 35; Fig. 2B and C).
Endosialin does not affect metastatic seeding or colonization
On the basis of the prominent metastasis phenotype in the
absence of an overt primary tumor phenotype, we hypothesized
that stromal endosialin might affect metastatic seeding and/or
colonization. Consequently, we studied metastatic colonization
upon tail vein injection of 4T1 (Fig. 3A–D) or LLC (Fig. 3E and F)
cells in WT and ENKO mice. There was no difference in lung tumor
burden between experimental groups in either tumor model,
indicating that stromal endosialin plays no role in metastatic
seeding or colonization.
Primary tumors in ENKO mice show no defects in stromal
architecture
The exclusion of an effect of endosialin on metastatic seeding
and colonization prompted us to analyze in greater detail stromal
attributes of primary tumors grown in WT and ENKO mice. In
particular, given the well documented upregulation of endosialin
expression on pericytes in the tumor vasculature (9–13), we
examined the architecture and functionality of tumor vessels.
4T1 primary tumors grown in BALB/c (Fig. 4A and B and Sup-
plementary Fig. S3A and S3B) and immunocompromised mice
(Fig. 4D and E) or LLC primary tumors (Supplementary Fig. S3C
and S3D) revealed no significant differences in the number of
tumor microvessels, total vessel area, vesselcaliber distribution, or
deposition of collagen IV in the vascular basement membrane
between WT and ENKO mice. Likewise, vessel maturation, as
assessed by pericyte coverage through aSMA and desmin staining,
did not differ in tumors grown in WT or ENKO mice (Fig. 4C and F
and Supplementary Fig. S3E and S3F). Similarly, functional
experiments showed no difference in vessel perfusion (data not
shown) or permeability as monitored by leakage of Hoechst dye
(Fig. 4G and H) or Evans blue (Supplementary Fig. S4A and S4B).
Consistent with the indistinguishable structural and functional
vessel attributes, primary tumor hypoxia, necrosis, tumor cell

 proliferation, or apoptosis did not differ between WT and ENKO
mice in either tumor model (Fig. 4I–L and Supplementary Fig.
S4C–S4G). Finally, given that endosialin is also expressed by
myofibroblasts, we assessed stromal collagen deposition in the
primary tumors by Sirius red staining and the distribution and
abundance
of
aSMA-positive
myofibroblasts, which
again
showed no differences between the experimental groups (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4H–S4J). Taken together, these studies revealed
no discernible structural stromal differences between tumors in
WT and ENKO mice that could account for the prominent met-
astatic phenotype of endosialin-deficient mice.
Stromal endosialin promotes tumor cell intravasation
A key role of pericytes is in stabilizing the normal vasculature
(33). Given the striking upregulation of endosialin expression on
tumor-associated pericytes (9–13), we next addressed whether
tumor cells displayed an altered propensity to intravasate into the
vasculature in WT and ENKO mice. Consistent with the data in Fig.
1, 4T1 primary tumor growth was indistinguishable between the
experimental groups, but ENKO mice showed a significant reduc-
tion of spontaneous lung metastasis as monitored by digital
droplet PCR (Fig. 5A and B). Importantly, tumor cell colonies
derived from arterial blood were significantly reduced in ENKO
mice (Fig. 5C and D), indicating that stromal endosialin regulates
intravasation of tumor cells from the primary tumor into the
circulation.
To test this hypothesis directly, we performed in vitro tumor
cell transmigration assays (Supplementary Fig. S5A–S5F). First,
10T1/2 pericyte-like cells expressing nontargeting (shNT) or
endosialin-targeting (shEN) shRNAs (Fig. 6A and Supplementary
Fig. S6A) were cultured on Matrigel-coated Transwell filters for 24
hours prior to addition of 4T1-RFP tumor cells, and transmigrated
cells were quantified 24 hours later by FACS analysis (Supple-
mentary Fig. S5A). The presence of endosialin-expressing shNT
10T1/2 cells, but not shEN 10T1/2 cells with downregulated
endosialin expression, enhanced transmigration of 4T1-RFP cells
(Fig. 6B). To ensure that these effects were not restricted to 10T1/2
cells, the experiment was repeated using pericytes isolated from
the brains of non-tumor bearing WT and ENKO mice (Fig. 6C and
D and Supplementary Fig. S6B). Again, the presence of WT
pericytes, but not ENKO pericytes, enhanced the transmigration
of cocultured 4T1-RFP cells (Fig. 6D). To validate the tumor cell
transmigration enhancing effect of pericyte-expressed endosialin,
we examined the ability of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer

 cells to transmigrate across a layer of shNT or shEN human brain
pericytes (Supplementary Figs. S5B and S6C–S6E). As with the
mouse cell experiments, the presence of shNT-human pericytes,
but not shEN-pericytes, promoted transmigration of the cocul-
tured human tumor cells (Fig. 6E).
Next, to closer model tumor cell intravasation, we mimicked
the 3D assembly of the normal vessel wall by allowing tumor cells
to transmigrate across sandwich-cultured HUVECs or microvas-
cular endothelial cells and pericytes (Supplementary Fig. S5C and
S5D). As in tumors (see Supplementary Fig. S1) neither HUVEC
(9) nor microvascular endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. S7A)
expressed endosialin. The presence of endosialin-expressing peri-
cytes significantly promoted tumor cell transmigration across the
endothelial cell monolayer (Fig. 6F). Equivalent results were
obtained using mouse microvascular endothelial cells and shEN
or shNT 10T1/2 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Notably, there
was no difference between tumor cell transmigration across the
endothelial monolayer in the presence of pericytes with down-
regulated endosialin expression and across an endothelial cell
monolayer without pericytes, indicating that endosialin-expres-
sing pericytes actively promote tumor cell intravasation into the
vasculature.

 Stromal cell endosialin effects on tumor cell intravasation are
cell contact-dependent
To shed further insights into the mechanism by which stromal
endosialin promotes tumor cell intravasation, we performed
transmigration experiments in the presence of pericyte-condi-
tioned medium (Supplementary Fig. S5E). The promotion of
tumor cell transmigration by endosialin-expressing pericytes
could not be recapitulated by replacing pericytes with pericyte-
conditioned medium (Fig. 6G), indicating that enhanced tumor
cell migration was not solely dependent on promigratory factors
secreted by endosialin-positive pericytes. Consequently, we set
out to determine, whether endosialin-mediated direct cell–cell
interactions between pericytes and tumor cells. To this end, we
performed adhesion assays with both shNT and shEN 10T1/2
pericyte-like cells and brain pericytes isolated from WT and ENKO
mice. With both cells types, adhesion of 4T1-RFP cells was
significantly impaired by downregulation or genetic deletion of
endosialin (Fig. 6H and I).
Finally, we investigated whether a pericyte-remodeled matrix
could substitute for the promigratory cell–cell contact–dependent
phenotype observed with intact pericytes. 10T1/2 cells and iso-
lated brain pericytes were allowed to remodel the matrix of
Matrigel-coated Transwell filters, prior to decellularization by
ammonium hydroxide treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5F).
Notably, the enhanced transmigratory phenotype of 4T1-RFP
cells cocultured with live shNT pericytes was not recapitulated
by a pericyte-remodeled matrix (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Sim-
ilarly, the increased adhesion of 4T1 cells to WT pericytes was not
recapitulated in an adhesion assay where WT pericytes were
replaced by WT pericyte–derived extracellular matrix (Supple-
mentary Fig. S7D). These data indicate that the presence of live
endosialin-expressing pericytes is required to induce the promi-
gratory, cell–cell contact–dependent intravasation phenotype of
tumor cells.

 comparison of microdissected breast tumor stroma and normal
adjacent stroma displayed a significantly higher level of endosia-
lin (CD248) mRNA in the tumor stroma (Fig. 7A). Next, we
stained human primary invasive breast cancer samples with two
independent anti-endosialin mAbs (B1/35 and FB5; ref. 9). As
illustrated in Fig. 7B, variable expression of endosialin was
detected on tumor pericytes and stromal myofibroblasts. How-
ever, with the exception of a rare subset of metaplastic breast
cancers, no endosialin expression was detected on tumor cells.
When comparing endosialin protein and CD248 mRNA levels in
the primary tumor with the metastatic stage, a significant corre-
lation was observed between endosialin protein (Fig. 7C and
Supplementary Fig. S8A) and mRNA levels (Fig. 7D) with
increased incidence of metastasis. In particular, higher CD248
expression in the primary tumor was found in patients with
distant metastasis to the lung, liver, and bone as compared with
patients without detectable metastatic disease (Supplementary
Fig. S8B). Importantly, examination of CD248 expression in
microdissected breast tumor stroma (34) revealed a significant
association
between
high
stromal
CD248
expression
and
decreased recurrence-free survival (Fig. 7E), whereas high CD248
expression in a dataset of 334 lymph-node positive breast cancers
(35) was significantly associated with decreased distant metasta-
sis-free survival (Fig. 7F). Taken together, these data indicate that
endosialin expression in the primary tumor serves as poor prog-
nostic factor for the development of metastatic disease.
Discussion
Endosialin (CD248) is a mesenchymal cell surface receptor that
is widely expressed during embryonic development and down-
regulated in healthy adult tissues (10, 11, 14, 25). Endosialin may
be abundantly expressed in the adult upon pathologic challenge,
most notably by pericytes and myofibroblasts in the tumor-
associated stroma (7, 9, 11, 12, 14) as well as in fibrotic (26)
and atherosclerotic tissues (H.G. Augustin, unpublished data).
Although endosialin was originally named TEM1 (tumor endo-
thelial marker 1; refs. 6, 8), this was later shown to be a misleading
nomenclature when different laboratories reported endosialin
expression being restricted to stromal pericytes and myofibro-
blasts and absent from endothelial cells of various human and
mouse tumors (9, 11, 12, 25, 36). The downregulated expression
in the adult in combination with the striking upregulation in
tumors makes endosialin an oncofetal protein that is, in principle,
strictly based on its unique pathology-associated expression pat-
tern, an attractive therapeutic target. Indeed, we demonstrate here,
in three different preclinical models that stromal endosialin
expression facilitates spontaneous distant site metastasis. To
mechanistically unravel the role of stromal endosialin during
individual steps of tumor progression and metastasis, we set out
comparative tumor experiments in wild-type (WT) and endosia-
lin-deficient (ENKO) mouse models and in 3D in vitro reconsti-
tution assays. Complementing these studies with the analysis of
human breast cancer expression datasets, we show that (i)
enhanced spontaneous metastasis in WT mice requires upre-
gulated endosialin expression on tumor-associated pericytes to
promote tumor cell intravasation into the circulation, (ii)
endosialin mediates direct cell–cell interactions of tumor-asso-
ciated pericytes and tumor cells to promote tumor cells trans-
migration across an endothelial monolayer, and (iii) breast
cancer patients with high primary tumor endosialin expression
have significantly higher rates of metastasis and reduced recur-
rence-free survival.
Previous studies addressing the role of pericytes in tumorigen-
esis have focused on ablating pericytes (37, 38) or blockade of
PDGFRb signaling in pericytes by genetic targeting (31), pharma-
cologic inhibition (39), PDGFRb-blocking antibodies (37, 40) or
PDGF-B–binding oligonucleotide aptamers (41). All these strate-
gies resulted in loss of pericyte coverage on the tumor vasculature,
subsequent vascular destabilization and, in most cases, a reduction
in tumor volume. Intriguingly, where it was examined, this vas-
cular destabilization and inhibition of tumor growth, potentially
enhancing tumor hypoxia and inducing tumor cell EMT, was
accompanied by increased metastatic spread (31, 37, 38). Indeed,
low pericyte coverage in clinical samples is associated with poor
patient prognosis (42, 43). These findings are reminiscent of recent
studies demonstrating that two independent genetic strategies to
reduce myofibroblasts in the stroma of pancreatic cancers resulted
in enhanced tumor aggressiveness (44, 45). However, while genet-
ic deletion of Shh resulted in enhanced tumor growth (45),
pharmacologic targeting of the Hh pathway improved drug deliv-
ery and reduced tumor invasion and metastasis (46, 47). These
contrasting data reinforce the notion that stromal effects on tumor
progression and metastasis may be highly contextual and that
stromal cells can play both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppres-
sing roles dependent on the tumor type and location. This has led
to the concept that it may be more effective to deploy strategies to
"normalize" or de-differentiate tumor-associated stromal cells
rather than target them for destruction.
Consistent with this concept, unlike targeting PDGFRb or
ablating pericytes, treatment of syngeneic tumor bearing human
CD248 knock-in mice with the anti-human endosialin antibody
MORAb-004 did not result in a reduction in vessel number or
destabilization of the vasculature, as monitored by endothelial
cell viability, pericyte coverage, and integrity of the basement
membrane, but significantly impaired the growth of B16-F10
tumors following subcutaneous or intravenous inoculation
(36). Importantly, in the study reported here, the impairment in
metastatic dissemination in the ENKO mice was not associated
with gross alterations in the tumor vasculature. Primary tumors in
both syngeneic and immunocompromised WT and ENKO mice
were indistinguishable in terms of vessel architecture including, as
previously observed in the developing retinal vasculature of ENKO
mice (28), no detectable loss in pericyte coverage. Similarly, there
were no significant differences in vascular patency in WT and
ENKO tumors as monitored by vessel perfusion, vascular leakage,
and levels of primary tumor hypoxia and necrosis, indicating that
an inability to upregulate endosialin expression in the tumor
stroma has minimal impact on vascular integrity. Importantly, in
primary tumors from ENKO mice, the number or distribution of
aSMA-expressing myofibroblasts was not altered, suggesting that
the expression of endosialin by myofibroblasts is not the driving
force of tumor cell dissemination and intravasation. Consistent
with this lack of stromal disruption, no differences in primary
tumor growth in WT and ENKO mice were detected in the three
tumor models used in this study. Previous studies also reported
no differences in LLC or B16-F0 subcutaneous primary tumor
growth in WT and ENKO mice (27, 28) or following intracranial
inoculation of C57MG glioblastoma cells (30). In contrast, when
HCT116 colorectal tumor fragments were orthotopically grafted
onto the intestinal surface, tumors in the ENKO mice were reduced
in volume and showed reduced local invasion and metastasis

 (27). The mechanism underlying these effects was not investigat-
ed, but the data demonstrate that stromal endosialin modulation
of primary tumor growth may vary depending on the tumor site
and the conditions of the microenvironment.
To relate endosialin to distinct steps of the metastatic cascade,
we performed seeding and colonization experiments by intrave-
nous injection of tumor cells. These experiments revealed unam-
biguously that endosialin was not involved in secondary site
colonization. We therefore focused on the intravasation of cells
from the primary tumor as a possible rate-limiting step of metas-
tasis. Indeed, while microvessel permeability were indistinguish-
able in primary tumors grown in WT and ENKO mice, the expres-
sion of endosialin had a pronounced effect on the ability of tumor
cells to enter the systemic blood circulation. Of note, we observed
in comparative studies a reduction in spontaneous metastasis in
both ENKO immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice,
which ruled out an involvement of an intact immune system as an
effector
of
the
endosialin-mediated
metastasis
phenotype.

 (48, 49); however, analysis of tumors growing in WT or ENKO
mice did not yield any significant differences in macrophage
numbers, indicating that macrophages are not the driving force
for endosialin-mediated tumor cell intravasation (C. K€
onig and
H.G. Augustin, unpublished data). In conclusion, although the
mechanisms of tumor cell intravasation are not well elucidated,
these data indicate that the interaction of tumor cells with both
pericytes and endothelial cells may play a role (50).
To delineate more directly the roles of individual cell popula-
tions, we mimicked the multicellular vascular crosstalk in a
modified Transwell migration assay. Pericytes with or without
endosialin expression were cocultured with endothelial cells, and
tumor cells were analyzed for their ability to transmigrate across
the endothelial layer. These in vitro reconstruction experiments
validated the in vivo findings to show that endosialin expression
by pericytes alone stimulated tumor cell transmigration. Impor-
tantly, this stimulatory behavior of endosialin-positive pericytes
was independent of the effect of pericytes on endothelial cells as
enhanced tumor cell transmigration was still observed in the
absence of an endothelial monolayer. Moreover, this ability of
endosialin-positive pericytes to promote tumor cell transmigra-
tion could not be recapitulated by pericyte-conditioned medium
or pericyte-remodeled extracellular matrix, indicating a require-
ment for a direct interaction between tumor cells and tumor
pericytes during intravasation. While the detailed molecular
mechanisms mediating this interaction await elucidation, anal-
ysis of global gene expression data of primary tumor cells isolated
from WT and ENKO tumor-bearing mice indicate that endosialin-
positive stroma does not alter the intrinsic tumor cell transcrip-
tional profile (C. Viski and Clare M. Isacke, unpublished data),
rather that it functions to modulate the local microenvironment.
Indeed, it has been reported previously that recombinant endo-
sialin can bind in in vitro assays to extracellular matrix compo-
nents, including collagen and fibronectin (24), and in vivo to the
vascular basement membrane (28). Thus, based on the available
data, we hypothesize that endosialin does not function as an
active metastasis promoting signaling factor in educating tumor
cells to gain invasive behavior, but rather as a facilitator tethering
tumor cells to the matrix and actively mediating their transmi-
gration through the vascular basement membrane and underlying
endothelial monolayer.
In conclusion, the data presented here causally link the expres-
sion of a metastasis-facilitating stromal receptor to a very specific
step of the metastatic cascade and shed important mechanistic
insight into the role of tumor-associated pericytes in mediating
tumor metastasis. Importantly, the clinical relevance of these
preclinical tumor experiments, involving independent tumor
models with corresponding mechanistic cellular experiments
could be validated by comparative pathology of human tumors.
Indeed, analysis of human breast cancer samples revealed that the
abundance of primary tumor stromal endosialin expression
strongly correlated with metastatic progression and reduced recur-
rence-free survival. Consequently, the findings of this study and
the unique oncofetal expression of endosialin warrant further
consideration of endosialin as a therapeutic target to limit tumor
progression and metastasis.
