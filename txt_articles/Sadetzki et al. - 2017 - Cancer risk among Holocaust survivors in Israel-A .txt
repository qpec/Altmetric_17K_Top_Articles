BACKGROUND: Holocaust survivors during World War II were exposed to various factors that are associated with cancer risk. The
objective of this study was to determine whether Holocaust survivors had an increased risk for developing cancer. METHODS: The
study population included 152,622 survivors. The main analysis was based on a comparison between individuals who were entitled to
compensation for suffering persecution during the war and individuals who were denied such compensation. A complementary analy-
sis compared survivors who were born in countries governed by Nazi Germany with survivors born in nonoccupied countries. A Cox
proportional hazards model was used, with the time at risk of cancer development starting on either January 1, 1960, or the date of
immigration to the date of cancer diagnosis or death or the date of last follow-up (December 31, 2006). RESULTS: Cancer was diag-
nosed in 22.2% of those who were granted compensation versus 16% of those who were denied compensation (P < .0001). Adjusting
for birth cohort, sex, country of origin, and period of immigration, both analyses revealed significant increased risks of developing
cancer in those who were exposed. For those who were granted versus denied compensation, the hazard ratios were 1.06 (P < .001)
for all sites, 1.12 (P 5 .07) for colorectal cancer, and 1.37 (P 5 .008) for lung cancer. For those born in occupied countries versus non-
occupied countries, the hazard ratios were 1.08 (P < .001), 1.08 (P 5 .003), and 1.12 (P 5 .02), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current
results, based on a large cohort of Holocaust survivors who were exposed to a variety of severe deprivations, add to the conflicting
and sparse knowledge on this issue and support the notion that this group has a small but consistent increase in cancer development.

INTRODUCTION
According to estimates of the International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, of the 688,000 Jews who
survived World War II (WWII) and remained alive in 2003, about 40% were living in Israel1; the estimated numbers alive
in Israel in 2003 and 2015 were 265,000 and 189,000, respectively.2,3 The survivors who, during the war, were in coun-
tries occupied by Nazi Germany or its allies, were subjected to prolonged severe and intensive stressors, including meta-
bolic insults (ie, starvation to the extent of restriction to 220-800 Kcal/day with protein and micronutrient deficiencies),
physical and chemical factors (eg, cold, overcrowding, exposure to known carcinogens), biologic agents (eg, infectious dis-
eases), intense and strenuous physical activity, physical and emotional abuse, and psychological responses to stressors (eg,
anxiety and sleep deprivation).4-6
Although all individuals surviving the war experienced some of the above-mentioned stressors, it might be expected
that the degree and mixture of exposures varied between individuals depending on their specific situation (being in a
ghetto, a concentration camp, or a work camp; in hiding; a victim of the Nazi persecution; or a partisan or other fighter).
Some of the above-mentioned environmental exposures and lifestyle habits are known to be associated with increased or
decreased risk of cancer.7-9

 The association between metabolic factors and can-
cer is well documented.7,10 There is a positive association
between body mass index and the development of both
colorectal and prostate cancers and between postmeno-
pausal overweight and breast cancer.7,9,11
Through the hormonal axis, starvation influences
menarche and menopause as well as premenopausal and
postmenopausal hormone levels and modifies the expres-
sion of oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes.12-15
Observational studies have demonstrated that prolonged
starvation may cause amenorrhea and influence fertility.13
Late onset of menarche and early menopause are generally
associated with lower rates of hormone-related cancers,
such as breast and ovarian cancers.7,14
The Netherlands cohort study15 explored the short-
term and long-term effects of moderate caloric restriction
on colon cancer during the Hunger winter (1944-1945), in
WWII (1940-1944) and in the Economic Depression
(1932-1940) periods. The researchers observed that expo-
sure to moderate caloric restrictions during childhood and
adolescence during the Hunger winter was inversely associ-
ated with colon cancer development. The authors suggested
that hormonal decrease of estrogen and insulin-like growth
factor levels in early life periods might lead to persistent epi-
genetic changes that decreased the risk for later cancer devel-
opment in adulthood. However, most studies dealing with
caloric restriction have investigated moderate reductions
(range, 10%-30%) in calories with general adequate nutri-
tion,16 whereas data are sparse on the impact of severe calo-
ric restriction on cancer development in combination with
multifaceted stress conditions like those experienced by the
Holocaust survivors.6 Among epidemiological studies that
have assessed the effect of starvation on cancer development,
most have dealt with breast cancer, with conflicting
results.10,11 Similarly, studies on colorectal cancers have
mostly demonstrated a protective effect.8,17,18
The role of social environmental stressors that produce
psychological responses in cancer development has been
evaluated in many studies, and some have suggested an asso-
ciation through hormonal or immunologic pathways.19,20
Stress works through the sympathetic nervous system and
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation, together
with related hormones that have an impact on the tumor
microenvironment. The mechanism might involve several
pathways, eg, cytokines, growth factors, receptors, hor-
mones, corticotrophin-releasing factors, and adhesion mole-
cules. The variables involved are so numerous that it is
difficult to isolate the cause or sequence of this relation-
ship.21,22 Another postulated mechanism for the possible
impact of psychological stress on cancer development is
through epigenetic modifications. Some epigenetic associa-
tion studies have linked DNA hypermethylation to certain
chronic diseases, including cancer.23 Studies in humans
have indicated that changes in DNA methylation can be
long-lasting consequences of stressor exposure.24 However,
other researchers claim that psychological stress cannot be
considered a direct cancer risk factor25-27 and thus posit that
stress impacts the risk of cancer through secondary mecha-
nisms. These may include behaviors such as smoking,
insomnia, alcohol abuse, and poor hygienic conditions,
which might interact with psychological responses to stres-
sors.22 Tobacco smoke is the leading risk factor for lung can-
cer.28 Smoking and heavy alcohol consumption are known
risk factors for many other cancer types, including, laryn-
geal, oral cavity, colorectal, and breast cancers.28,29 The
adoption of the latter 2 harmful life style habits is strongly
and positively associated with the development of post-
traumatic stress disorder after extreme stress, such as living
in a war zone or engaging in combat.30,31
Crowded and poor sanitary conditions in the concen-
tration camps and ghettos increased exposure to infectious
diseases.32 Associations of exposures to hepatitis B and C,
human papillomavirus, and Helicobacter pylori with liver,
cervical, and stomach cancers, respectively, are well
known.33,34 Holocaust survivors were exposed to many of
these factors simultaneously, but their joint effect on cancer
risk is unknown. The number of studies that directly
assessed the impact of the Holocaust experience on cancer
risk is limited, and the results were inconclusive.35,36
The objective of the current study was to assess can-
cer rates in a large cohort of Holocaust survivors based on
the history of their war experience (which was used as a
marker of exposure). In this analysis, the assignment of
survivors to exposure groups and information on cancer
development were based on individual data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Despite the many discussions conducted during the years by
various Israeli official organizations, no single, common def-
inition for being a “Holocaust survivor” exists.37 For practi-
cal purposes, the determined definitions for compensation
were in accordance with international agreements and judi-
cial processes and mainly referred to criteria of disability (see
below descriptions of 1st and 3rd study groups). In 1952,
the “West German Federal Indemnification Law” (known
as
BEG)
was
enacted
and,
after
the
“Reparations
Agreement” between West Germany and Israel in 1957, the
first Israeli law, the “Victims of Nazi Persecution Act,” was
established. Over the years, the laws were developed gradu-
ally to allow compensation according to different criteria.

 The study population of this historical prospective
cohort included Holocaust survivors who applied for
compensation according to this set of Israeli laws. Two
analyses, main and complementary, were performed. For
the main analysis, 4 study groups were defined according
to inclusion criteria of the relevant laws.
Group A
Group A includes individuals who applied for and were
granted compensation under the “Victims of Nazi Perse-
cution Act” (1957). This group was limited to Israeli Jews
who were stateless refugees under the direct occupation of
the Nazi Germany, as opposed to the Axis countries
(unless individuals could prove they were in a camp or
were subjected to violence in the Nazi regime); immi-
grated to Israel up to 1953; applied for compensation up
to 1969; were recognized as persecuted based on selected
conditions (eg, being in a closed ghetto, a concentration
camp, or escaping under a false identity); and were classi-
fied as suffering from at least 25% disability (n 5 77,688
individuals). Since 2001, individuals who complied with
these criteria but had not applied for compensation up to
1969 were also granted compensation (n 5 4239
individuals).
Group B
Group B includes individuals who were in concentration
camps or work camps for at least 6 months or who were in
ghettoes or living under a false identity or hiding for at
least 18 months. This group has been added under the
framework of the Article 2 fund (established in 1992) and
the “Holocaust Survivors’ Benefits Act” (established in
2007). The entitlement for compensation was based on 4
criteria: 1) receiving income maintenance, 2) having been
a persecuted individual, 3) having lived in a hostile coun-
try, and 4) having lived under specific personal circum-
stances during the war (eg, in a ghetto). It should be noted
that assignment to this group entitled individuals to
expanded benefits and that eligible individuals were enti-
tled to move from group A to group B.
Disabled War Veterans
Disabled war veterans include individuals who, between
1939 and 1945, served as soldiers in the allied armies, par-
tisans, or the Red Army and were classified by the Israeli
authorities as having at least 10% health disability (physi-
cal or mental disabilities that resulted from an injury or
disease that occurred or worsened during the war).
Denied Compensation
The denied compensation group includes individuals who
applied as Holocaust victims under the above-mentioned
laws but were found ineligible for compensation. This
group, although they were in some ways caught up in the
war in Europe, did not meet the legal criteria required for
compensation. Leading causes for denial of compensation
included time of immigration or application for compen-
sation, residency sequence, geographic locations, minimal
disability, and minimal time of residence in a camp or of
persecution. Those who were denied compensation could
reapply according to updates of the laws or changes in
individual circumstances. Periodically, re-examination of
applications was initiated by the authorities for added pro-
tection of survivors’ rights.
For the main analysis, the first 3 groups, defined as
“granted compensation”, were compared with the fourth,
defined as “denied compensation”. For the complemen-
tary analysis, the first 3 groups were reclassified by country
of origin. This classification was based on a general his-
toric definition according to the Nazi occupation, which
was adopted by governmental committees and the Reha-
bilitation Office. Two subgroups were defined: Holocaust
survivors born in Nazi Germany or in direct Nazi-
occupied countries that were included in the “final sol-
ution”, as defined in the Wannsee Conference (known as
“first line”), and Holocaust survivors from nonoccupied
countries of Axis powers, allied powers, and neutral coun-
tries (known as “second line”).38 In this complementary
analysis, countries were classified as follows:
1. Survivors born in Germany, Poland, Austria, France,
Netherland, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czecho-
slovakia, Latvia, occupied territories of the former
Soviet Union, Belarus, Lithuania, Ukraine, Greece and
Tunis (classified as “occupied countries”); and
2. Survivors born in Romania, Bulgaria, Moldova,
unoccupied territories of the former Soviet Union,
Turkey, Italy, and Libya (classified as “nonoccupied
countries”).
The compensation files did not include details
regarding the exposure types, the nature of suffering of the
survivors, or the specific eligibility/ineligibility criteria.
Therefore, the compensation group (main analysis) and
the country of birth (complementary analysis) served as
markers for exposure (“granted compensation” vs “denied
compensation” or “occupied countries” vs “nonoccupied
countries”, respectively).
Data were abstracted from the Rehabilitation Office
at the Ministry of Finance (since 2009, this office was

 renamed the Holocaust Survivors’ Rights Authority and is
referred to herein as the “Rights Authority”) and the Con-
ference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany
(referred to herein as the “Claims Conference”). These
sources include registries of the Holocaust survivors who
applied for compensation.
The files were linked with the Israeli Central Popula-
tion Registry (operating since 1948) to retrieve vital status
and to the National Cancer Registry to update cancer
diagnoses. The cancer registry (with a coverage rate of
94.2% for malignant solid tumors and 84.6% for hemato-
poietic tumors39) was established in 1960 and is notified
of all malignant tumors, as mandated by law. For each
malignancy, topography and morphology (according to
the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology,
3rd edition), and the date of tumor diagnosis were
obtained. The study was approved by the Chaim Sheba
Medical Center review board committee.
Crude proportions of cancer were calculated as the
number of cases divided by the number of individuals in
the
cohort.
Data
analysis
was
based
on
a
Cox
proportional-hazards model. The outcome variable was
the time from January 1, 1960 (year of initiation of the
cancer registry) to the date of cancer diagnosis (with
follow-up to December 31, 2006). Death events before a
cancer diagnosis were handled in the Cox regression as
censoring events. Individuals who immigrated to Israel
later than 1960 (and up to 2006) were included in the risk
sets from their time of immigration. Because the average
number of follow-up years varied between the groups,
person-years (PYs) were presented by study groups.
The following covariates were included in the Cox
model: exposure group, sex, age (year of birth), continent
of birth (Europe, Asia-Africa, or other), and immigration
period (grouped into 10-year intervals of year of immigra-
tion) to control for selection bias that might be related to
year of immigration to Israel. Adjusted cause-specific haz-
ard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were
estimated. To test the proportional hazards assumption,
we split the follow-up period into 2 parts (1960-1980 and
1981-2006), ran the Cox regression for each period sepa-
rately, and compared the derived HRs. An interaction
term between sex and exposure group was included and
was identified as statistically significant. Therefore, we
present results stratified by sex as well as overall. Two-
sided statistical tests were performed at the 5% level.
RESULTS
For the main analysis, the study included 152,622 indi-
viduals who contributed 5,665,009 PYs. Of these,
142,591 individuals (5,219,342 PYs) were granted com-
pensation (81,927 from group A, 46,491 individuals
from group B, and 14,173 from the disabled war veterans
group) and 10,031 were denied compensation (445,667
PYs). The complementary analysis included 142,134
individuals (5,651,034 PYs), of which 57.1% contributed
to the occupied countries group (Table 1).
The disabled war veterans group included mostly
men (95%), but only 41% to 53% of the other groups
were men. The mean age at end of follow-up ranged from
73 to 81 years. Although nearly all individuals (>95%) in
group A and in the denied compensation group and most
individuals (80%) from nonoccupied countries immi-
grated to Israel before 1960, 26%, 68%, and 22% of indi-
viduals in group B, the disabled war veterans group, and
the occupied countries groups, respectively, immigrated
after 1990.
The mean period between the end of WWII and end
of follow-up ranged between 55 and 59 years, and the
mean calculated latency period from the start of follow-up
was 36.5 6 13.4 years. During 1960 through 2006,
33,342 cancer cases were diagnosed; breast, colon, and
prostate cancers were the most commonly diagnosed, con-
stituting almost 50% of all cases.
The crude cancer proportion was 22% and was
lower in the denied compensation group (16%) compared
with each of the granted compensation groups (22%,
21%, and 27% for group A, group B, and the war veterans
group, respectively) (Table 1). For most sites, the crude
incidence rate was lower in the denied compensation
group than in the granted compensation groups. Among
the group of individuals born in the occupied countries,
higher rates were observed for colorectal, stomach, lung
and renal cancers and leukemia than in the group of indi-
viduals born in the nonoccupied countries (Supporting
Table 1; see online supporting information).
The adjusted risk for cancer was lower among
women, younger individuals (expressed by later birth
cohort), and Asian-born/African-born individuals (Table
2). Compared with the reference group that was denied
compensation (main analysis), a significant increased risk
for developing cancer was observed among the total
granted compensation group (HR, 1.06), group A (HR,
1.10), and the disabled war veterans group (HR, 1.53).
The occupied countries group (complementary analysis)
had an 8% increased risk compared with the nonoccupied
countries group (95% CI, 1.05-1.10). A sensitivity analy-
sis for all-site cancers among the latter groups removing
the “disabled war veterans” produced similar results (HR,
1.06; 95% CI, 1.03-1.09; data not shown).

 An analysis stratified by sex indicated higher cause-
specific HRs among men. The HR for total granted com-
pensation versus denied compensation was 1.07 (95% CI,
1.06-1.09) for men and 1.02 (95% CI, 1.0-1.04) for
women. For those in occupied countries versus nonoccupied
countries, the HRs were 1.10 (95% CI, 1.06-1.14) and 1.05
(95% CI, 1.02-1.09) for men and women, respectively.
A separate analysis by 2 follow-up periods (1960-
1980 and 1981-2006) revealed no major deviation from
the proportional hazards assumption for the main compar-
ative groups over the total follow-up period. For the total
granted versus denied compensation groups, the HR was
1.09 (95% CI, 1.03-1.15) for the first period and 1.05
(95% CI, 1.04-1.07) for the second period, whereas the
value for the full period from 1960 to 2006 was 1.06 (95%
CI, 1.05-1.08). Similar small differences between the HRs
of the two periods compared to the full period were
observed in the subgroups of those granted compensation
and in the complementary analysis (data not shown).
An analysis by tumor site revealed increased risks for
colorectal cancer (HR, 1.12 [P 5 .07] for the total granted
vs denied compensation groups and HR, 1.08 [P 5 .003]
for the occupied countries vs nonoccupied countries
groups) and lung cancer (HR, 1.37 [P 5 .008] for the
total granted vs denied compensation groups and HR,
1.12 [P 5 .02] for the occupied countries vs nonoccupied
countries groups) (Table 3). Increased risks of these can-
cers were also demonstrated in each granted compensa-
tion group (colorectal cancer: group A [HR, 1.12; 95%
CI, 0.99-1.27], group B [HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.0-1.31],
and disabled war veterans [HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.21-
1.68]; lung cancer: group A [HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.13-
1.79], group B [HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.95-1.57], and dis-
abled war veterans [HR, 2.59, 95% CI, 1.94-3.45]).
These increased risks were statistically significant in men.
For women, all these HRs were above 1.00 but reached
statistical significance for lung cancer in group A and dis-
abled war veterans (data not shown). According to Table
3, no risk was demonstrated for female breast and genital
organs cancers neither for the total granted compensation
versus denied compensation groups nor for the occupied
countries versus nonoccupied countries groups.
In the complementary analysis, significant HRs were
also demonstrated for cancers of the prostate, pancreas

 (among men), thyroid, kidney, liver, cervix, and stomach
(among men) and chronic leukemia in the occupied coun-
tries group compared with the nonoccupied countries
group.
Although the mean age at cancer diagnosis was oldest
among the disabled war veterans group (77.1 years; proba-
bly reflecting their older mean age), the median age at diag-
nosis was similar between the other groups (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
In the current study, we observed an overall cancer crude
proportion of 22% and an HR of 1.06 for developing can-
cer when comparing the granted versus denied compensa-
tion groups and an HR of 1.08 among the occupied
countries group compared with the nonoccupied coun-
tries group. Our results suggest an excess risk of develop-
ing lung and colorectal cancers among those most exposed
to and surviving Holocaust conditions. These results were
significant and consistent in the 2 different comparisons.
The all-sites, cause-specific HRs were higher in men than
in women, the risk for colorectal cancer was higher in
men, and the risk for lung cancer was similar for both
sexes. Risks of breast cancer and gynecologic cancers were
similar in the different exposure groups.
Several studies have investigated health outcomes in
Holocaust survivors and have mainly demonstrated an
increased risk of developing psychological disturbance,
including stress, depression, and sleep disorders.40-42 Pas-
ternak and Brooks assessed long-term effects of the Holo-
caust on female reproductive function among Hungarian
Jewish women and demonstrated that amenorrhea
occurred in 94.8% of women during encampment.13 A

2.99), and metabolic syndrome (OR, 2.14; 95% CI,
1.48-3.47).43 However, data on cancer risk among Holo-
caust survivors are sparse and inconclusive.35,36
Keinan-Boker et al35 evaluated cancer risk among
Jewish Holocaust survivors based on 315,544 European-
born individuals by comparing those who immigrated to
Israel after 1945 (exposed) and before 1945 (nonex-
posed). Like us, those investigators reported a significantly
increased risk among the exposed group to develop cancer
(all sites), colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. However,
they also reported an increased risk of breast cancer in
women. Among the limitations of the latter study were its
ecologic nature and doubts over the comparability of
those who immigrated to Israel before and after the war.
The individually defined exposure and outcome used in
our study add to the robustness of the results.
Long-term health effects of severe hunger were
observed among survivors of the 872 days siege in Lenin-
grad. The effects included increased blood pressure,
increased risks of ischemic heart disease and stroke (partly
mediated by blood pressure) among men, and an
increased risk of breast cancer mortality among women
who experienced the siege around puberty.44,45 Other
studies assessing the possible association between hunger
and breast cancer in Norway (1200 Kcal per day) and
Guernsey produced conflicting results.46,47 A study that
assessed the risk of developing breast cancer among 7303
women who were hospitalized before age 40 years for
anorexia nervosa identified a significantly reduced risk for
this cancer (standardized incidence ratio, 0.47; 95% CI,
0.19-0.97), which was most pronounced in nulliparous
women (standardized incidence ratio, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.03-
0.87).48 In the current analysis, no excess risk for breast
cancer was identified.
Regarding these inconsistent results, it has been sug-
gested that the European Jewish WWII survivors experi-
enced different stresses than European non-Jewish WWII
survivors.35,49 For example, the Norwegian study50 dem-
onstrated a reduced risk for breast cancer with a shorter
term (<1 year) and less severe exposure to energy restric-
tion (approximately 50% reduction in calorie intake and

 stable diet quality) compared with the exposed Jewish
cohort during WWII. In addition, the survivors of the
Dutch famine17 of 1944 had higher breast cancer rates in
the face of energy restriction, which was more severe than
that in the Norwegian survivors but less severe than that
observed in the Jewish holocaust survivors.35
Holocaust survivors were exposed to various factors
that have been investigated in other situations, as mentioned
above, and many of them have been causally related to
severe morbidity and increased mortality. In 2010, Hursting
also mentioned that other factors, especially when com-
bined with other severe stressors, underlie the cancer risk
observed in those studies.51 In accordance with this, we
could not a priori hypothesize the direction of the associa-
tions; therefore, 2-sided tests were performed.
Our results on colon cancer agree with those
reported by Keinan-Boker and colleagues.35 However, the
results from other studies on the risk of colon cancer are
sparse and inconsistent. Among 3901 men and 1429
women who
experienced the
Leningrad siege,
no
increased mortality of colon cancer was observed (men:
HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.51-1.34; women: HR, 0.65; 95%
CI, 0.27-1.52, respectively).45
Lower colorectal cancer risks were reported among
individuals who were born during WWII in Norway and
Estonia, countries that suffered from varying nutritional
deprivation.52 The Netherlands Cohort Study also identi-
fied a weak inverse relation between energy restriction early
in life and subsequent colon carcinoma risk in men and
women.53 Most studies have demonstrated a positive associ-
ation between body mass index and colon cancer. However,
other nutritional risk factors also may affect colorectal
tumor development. For example, an association between
deficiencies of vitamin D, minerals, calcium, and folic acid
and colon cancer has been reported.54,55 These deficiencies
were prevalent in the ghettos and concentration camps.4,5
The question of whether psychological response to
stressors affects cancer development has been evaluated in
many studies. A review assessing the results from 70 longitu-
dinal, prospective studies concluded that there is no psycho-
logical stress for which an influence on cancer development
has been convincingly demonstrated.56 Studies have dem-
onstrated that factors like exposure to chronic stressors,
depression, and social support have been linked to tumor
biology, viral oncogenesis, and cell-mediated immunity.
These factors accelerate cell tumor growth and molecular
processes that facilitate the promotion of malignancy and
increase tumor cell survival; however, there is no conclusive
evidence regarding the role of these processes in the initia-
tion of cancer per se.22,57 In a prospective study conducted
in Denmark investigating whether the death of a child is
related to cancer risk in bereaved parents, a slightly increased
overall cancer risk among mothers was observed (relative
risk, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.01-1.37). This association was most
prominent for smoking-related malignancies (relative risk,
1.65; 95% CI, 1.05-2.59), and no significantly increased
risk was noted for alcohol-related malignancies, virus/
immune-related malignancies, or hormone-related malig-
nancies, including breast cancer.58 These results indicate
that the impact of emotional stress on cancer development
might be indirect and influenced by lifestyle habits, such as
smoking. This observation might explain the increased risk
for lung cancer observed in our study, which is in line with
the risk described by Koupil et al, who reported higher mor-
tality from respiratory cancer among men who were exposed
to the Leningrad siege (HR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.02-1.78).45
Our results demonstrated differences in the overall
risk for cancer development between men and women.
These differences might be driven by the null results seen
for breast and gynecologic cancers in women. Note that
breast cancer is the most common malignancy among
women in Israel and that, altogether, these cancers consti-
tuted greater than 40% of the cancers among women in this
cohort.
The advantages of this study include a large sample
size, a long follow-up period, and individual data on clas-
sification of both exposure (based on 2 separate defini-
tions of being exposed to Holocaust conditions) and
cancer diagnoses.
The main disadvantages are that the definition of
exposure was drawn from files created for legal purposes
or was based on country of origin, which could lead to
misclassification of exposure; that the results apply only to
survivors who immigrated to Israel and were alive at least
until 1953; and that cancers that occurred before 1960
were not counted. We note that, in 1953, the Israeli gov-
ernment began taking national responsibility for the pro-
vision of compensation to Holocaust survivors who were
citizens of Israel and who immigrated to Israel from that
year onward, and that the Israeli National Cancer Registry
was established in 1960. Because, as mentioned above,
only approximately 40% of the Jews who survived WWII
were living in Israel, a question regarding the generaliza-
tion of results might arise. Unfortunately, one cannot
account for a possible bias that could have occurred by
limiting the analysis to this group. A specific limitation is
that the timing of Holocaust compensation legislation
may have created a bias in the exposure classification. This
could explain the null results that were observed from the
comparison of cancer risk between group B and the

 denied compensation group (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-
1.07). Because this group was formed relatively late (in
2007-2008), these individuals had to be alive to apply for
this additional compensation, and it is possible that only
healthier survivors applied for it, creating a survival bias in
this group.
Because no data were available on the degree of the
various exposures, no dose-response effect could be
assessed. Nevertheless, in our approach, the entitlement of
survivors to compensation was based on criteria like stay-
ing in a ghetto, being persecuted in a hostile country, or
suffering from a certain level of disability, which served as
markers for actually experiencing the Holocaust condi-
tions. Although the main exposure definition is subject to
some misclassification, we believe this approach is supe-
rior to definitions based only on time and place of birth,
as is done in most published studies on this topic. More-
over, our complementary analysis of those who were
granted compensation, hypothesizing that individuals
born in countries directly governed by Nazi Germany
experienced more severe conditions for longer duration
than individuals born in other countries, supports and
strengthens our main results.
The high rates of late immigration in the disabled
war veterans group and in group B (68% and 26%,
respectively compared to 0.05% and 1.8% in group A and
in the denied compensation group, respectively) probably
represent immigration from the former USSR (who
arrived in Israel only since 1990 and mainly after the dis-
solution of the Soviet Union in 1991), introducing a pos-
sible survival bias in these groups. Nevertheless, such bias
could decrease the observed effect because of undercount-
ing cancer. In addition, this group of soldiers might be
different from the other groups of civilians who experi-
enced the war. Nevertheless, the inclusion of this group
was based on the Claims Conference distinction, which
recognizes soldiers and partisans as 1 of the Holocaust sur-
vivors groups, because most of them (especially Jewish
partisans) experienced persecution, hid under a false iden-
tity, and were incarcerated in camps. In view of these pos-
sible biases, in the complementary comparison, we added
a sensitivity analysis excluding the disabled war veterans
and observed a similar increased risk in the occupied
countries group compared with the nonoccupied coun-
tries group.
In contrast, the high rates of early immigration
(�95%) observed in group A and in the denied compen-
sation group suggest that these groups are complete and
do not include substantial survival bias. To take into con-
sideration concerns relating to survival bias, all analyses
were adjusted for the period of immigration. Additional
reassurances about the data’s validity are the observations
that cancer risk was 17% lower among women, increased
with age, and was 40% lower in African-born and Asian-
born individuals, all of which agree with the age-specific,
sex-specific, and origin-specific cancer rates in Israel.59
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest and
most comprehensive observational study assessing cancer
risk among Holocaust survivors based on individual data.
In line with some other previous findings, the consistency
of our results observed in both men and women and in
the 2 different approaches supports the association
between being a Holocaust survivor and an increased risk
of developing colorectal and lung cancers. These results
indicate that survivors of the Holocaust have a small but
consistent increase in cancer risk. The findings emphasize
the complexity of the etiology of cancer development and
the difficulties in determining the role of individual risk
factors in the face of simultaneous exposures.
