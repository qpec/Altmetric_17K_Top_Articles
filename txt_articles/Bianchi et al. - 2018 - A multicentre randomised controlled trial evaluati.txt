Abstract
A randomised, controlled, multicentre clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the effi-
cacy of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane (EpiFix) allograft as an adjunct to
multilayer compression therapy for the treatment of non-healing full-thickness venous
leg ulcers. We randomly assigned 109 subjects to receive EpiFix and multilayer com-
pression (n = 52) or dressings and multilayer compression therapy alone (n = 57).
Patients were recruited from 15 centres around the USA and were followed up for
16 weeks. The primary end point of the study was defined as time to complete ulcer
healing. Participants receiving weekly application of EpiFix and compression were sig-
nificantly more likely to experience complete wound healing than those receiving stan-
dard wound care and compression (60% versus 35% at 12 weeks, P = 0⋅0128, and 71%
versus 44% at 16 weeks, P = 0⋅0065). A Kaplan–Meier analysis was performed to com-
pare the time-to-healing performance with or without EpiFix, showing a significantly
improved time to healing using the allograft (log-rank P = 0⋅0110). Cox regression anal-
ysis showed that subjects treated with EpiFix had a significantly higher probability
of complete healing within 12 weeks (HR: 2⋅26, 95% confidence interval 1⋅25–4⋅10,
P = 0⋅01) versus without EpiFix. These results confirm the advantage of EpiFix allo-
graft as an adjunct to multilayer compression therapy for the treatment of non-healing,
full-thickness venous leg ulcers.
Introduction
Venous leg ulcers (VLUs), which affect over 2 million peo-
ple annually in the USA, have significant clinical and eco-
nomic consequences on society (1). VLUs are often marked
by a significant level of chronicity and may require many
months of treatment before a satisfactory level of healing is
achieved (2). Even once healed, the recurrence of VLUs is
common (2,3). Slow rates of healing and frequent recurrence
result in prolonged disability and the need for repetitive care,

Efficacy of EpiFix for treatment of venous leg ulcers
of healing and recurrence result in prolonged disability
and the need for repetitive care, which compounds the
psychosocial issues and economic burdens associated
with this condition
• the purpose of this study was to randomise and evaluate
the clinical effectiveness (efficacy) of the weekly appli-
cation of dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane
(EpiFix) allograft as an adjunct to multilayer compres-
sion therapy in 109 patients from 15 clinical centres in
the USA
• this study confirms that the weekly application of Epi-
Fix – a dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane
allograft created by the proprietary PURION® Pro-
cess – results in significantly increased rates of complete
healing of venous leg ulcers and decreases the time to
healing compared with standard moist dressings, debride-
ment and multilayer compression alone
which compounds the psychosocial issues and economic bur-
dens associated with the condition (2). In the USA, the esti-
mated payer burden associated with the treatment of VLUs was
close to $15 billion in 2014, and this number is only expected
to rise (4).
Venous ulceration occurs due to a complex chain of events
precipitated by chronic venous insufficiency and venous
hypertension (5). Over time, small vessel damage, oedema,
haemosiderin deposition and low-grade tissue inflammation
develops, which can cause ulceration (6). These same factors
often influence the wound’
s ability to progress through the
proper healing phases of haemostasis, inflammation, prolif-
eration and remodelling, resulting in a chronic wound stalled
in the inflammation or proliferation phase (1). Common VLU
symptoms include oedema, itching and exudate, leading to an
increased risk of infection. Severe pain associated with VLUs
can be disabling and has negative emotional, psychological and
economic effects on the patient (4,7). The long-term sequela
of chronic VLUs may result in decreased quality of life due to
mobility limitations and social isolation.
The primary objective of venous ulcer management includes
healing of the ulcer, improvement of venous hypertension and
prevention of recurrence. The therapeutic mainstay in the man-
agement of VLUs is graduated compression therapy and limb
elevation to improve blood flow to the affected limb and reduc-
tion of the oedema. Based on haemodynamic venous evalua-
tion, some patients will benefit from superficial venous ablation
(8). Comprehensive care of VLUs includes compression ther-
apy, local wound debridement, control of bioburden and wound
moisture balance with appropriate topical dressings (9). Even
with the highest levels of clinical expertise and patient compli-
ance with comprehensive care and adequate compression ther-
apy, only approximately 45% of VLUs will be healed within
12 weeks of treatment initiation (10).
Clinicians have observed that percentage reduction in the
ulcer area after treatment initiation is predictive of ultimate
ulcer closure (11,12). Failure to achieve wound reduction of
at least 40% within 4 weeks of standard comprehensive ther-
apy suggests the need for commencement of alternative and/or
advanced treatments (13). Current treatment guidelines indi-
cate that failure to demonstrate improvement after 4 weeks of
treatment, with a decrease in wound size of at least 30% to
40%, should lead the clinician to consider advanced treatment
options, yet there is little consensus as to which advanced treat-
ment should be chosen. Advanced wound therapies, includ-
ing biological dressings such as Apligraf® (Organogenesis,
Canton, MA, USA), Dermagraft® (Organogenesis, Canton,
MA, USA) and EpiFix® (MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta, GA);
split-thickness skin grafts; cellular therapy; negative pressure
therapy; electrical stimulation; and ultrasound therapy have all
been used as treatments for VLUs.
The health care community is currently focusing much atten-
tion on the use of amniotic tissue as an advanced biological
wound therapy, yet reports of clinical use of placental tissue in
Eastern and Western medicine have spanned centuries (14–18).
Amniotic membrane contains essential, active, healing growth
factors. In addition, it is a unique material, and its composition
contains collagen types IV, V and VII. Amniotic membrane is
composed of structural extracellular matrix (ECM), which also
contains specialised proteins, fibronectin, laminins, proteogly-
cans and glycosaminoglycans. The properties of the tissue all
support its use in wound management (19).
In the clinical literature of the 1970s to early 1980s, many
advantages of using amniotic membrane as a wound covering
were described, including the prevention of infection, allevia-
tion of pain, acceleration of wound healing and good handling
properties of the tissue (14–18). Even with these positive find-
ings surrounding the use of amniotic membrane as a wound
dressing, its use was largely abandoned because of the emer-
gence of the human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C,
fear of the potential for disease transmission and other opera-
tional and regulatory issues.
Driven by history and advancements in scientific knowledge
regarding the inherent biological and physiological character-
istics of placental tissues, there have been renewed efforts to
develop methods of obtaining and processing placental tissue,
so it can be used safely and conveniently in a variety of clini-
cal applications. One such method, the proprietary PURION®
Process, which has been in use since 2006, safely and gently
separates placental tissues obtained from screened and tested
donors under sterile conditions, cleans and reassembles lay-
ers and then dehydrates the tissue, resulting in a commer-
cially available dehydrated human amnion/chorion membrane
(dHACM) allograft (EpiFix®, MiMedx Group Inc., Marietta,
GA). The PURION Process removes blood components while
protecting the delicate scaffold of the amniotic membrane, leav-
ing an intact ECM. Processing and preserving the tissue in this
way retains the key proteins in quantities equivalent to unpro-
cessed amnion/chorion membrane, which assures the reten-
tion of signalling molecules and the desired natural biological
activities (20). An array of 36 cytokines known to regulate
processes involved in inflammation and wound healing has
been identified in EpiFix (20). The EpiFix allograft has been
found to contain quantifiable levels of the angiogenic cytokines
angiogenin, angiopoietin-2 (ANG-2), epidermal growth factor
(EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), heparin-binding
epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF), hepatocyte growth fac-
tor (HGF), platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB),

 Efficacy of EpiFix for treatment of venous leg ulcers
C. Bianchi et al.
placental growth factor (PlGF) and vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) (21). These factors support the fact that Epi-
Fix has the potential to promote revascularisation and tissue
healing within poorly vascularised, non-healing wounds (21).
Indeed, the ability of EpiFix to promote the healing of diabetic
foot ulcers has already been established in several randomised,
controlled studies (22–24).
The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of
using EpiFix as an adjunct to standard comprehensive wound
therapy for the treatment of non-healing, full-thickness VLUs.
The hypothesis to be tested is that the use of EpiFix offers a
statistically significant advantage over standard care alone for
the treatment of VLUs.
Patients and methods
We conducted a 16 -week, multicentre, randomised, controlled,
open-label study designed to evaluate the efficacy of EpiFix
allograft as an adjunct to standard comprehensive wound ther-
apy of moist dressings and multilayer compression in the treat-
ment of VLUs. The study population consisted of patients
with VLUs receiving care from physicians specialising in
wound care and/or podiatric specialists at 15 outpatient wound
care centres geographically distributed across the USA. Of
the 15 study sites, nine were private practice, and six were
hospital-based centres. Patient consent was obtained prior to
any study-related procedures, and an Investigational Review
Board (IRB)-approved informed consent form was signed. In
obtaining and documenting informed consent, each study site
complied with applicable regulatory requirements and adhered
to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) principles, and the study was
conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declara-
tion of Helsinki. Additionally, all study products used in this
study were manufactured, handled and stored in accordance
with applicable Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP). The
study was reviewed and approved by Chesapeake IRB or each
sites’ local IRB and was pre-registered in Clinical Trials.gov
(NCT02011503). The confidentiality of all patient records was
maintained.
Patient eligibility
The study population consisted of patients presenting for care
of a VLU. Patients over the age of 18 with a full-thickness
VLU of at least 30 days duration, with an ankle-brachial pres-
sure index of >0⋅75, were eligible for study inclusion. Eligible
patients were then screened for the presence of specific exclu-
sion criteria, including a VLU penetrating into muscle, tendon
or bone; signs of ulcer infection or cancer; a VLU located on
the dorsum of the foot; or more than 50% of the ulcer below
the malleolus. Patients were also excluded from eligibility if
they had received negative pressure wound therapy or hyper-
baric oxygen therapy in the last 7 days or treatment with other
advanced wound care products within the past 30 days. Eli-
gible patients willing to participate in the clinical study and
who agreed to comply with the weekly visits and follow-up
regimen consented and entered the screening phase of the
study.
Screening phase
The screening period was designed to determine whether eli-
gible subjects could proceed to the treatment period of the
study. During this 2 -week screening period, a series of assess-
ments were conducted to determine continued eligibility. These
assessments included a review of demographics, VLU his-
tory, medical history and concomitant medications. Physical
examinations included vital signs, pain level using the visual
analogue scale, assessment of signs and symptoms of clini-
cal infection of the study ulcer and ankle-brachial index (ABI)
measurement. Treatment received during the screening phase
consisted of moist wound dressings and multilayer compres-
sion bandages (3 M™ Coban™ 2 Layer Compression System
OR Coban™ 2 Layer Lite Compression System). Photographs
and measurements of the ulcer were obtained post-debridement.
The Silhouette® camera (Aranz Medical, Christchurch, New
Zealand) was used to perform wound imaging, measurement
and documentation in order to support accurate and consis-
tent wound assessment across all study sites. At the end of
the 2 -week screening phase, subjects with VLUs with an area
between 1 and 25 cm2 after debridement, which had not reduced
in size by at least 25% with moist dressings and multilayer com-
pression during the prior 2 weeks, and who continued to meet
all inclusion and exclusion criteria were then randomised and
entered the treatment phase of the study.
Randomisation was conducted by sealed envelope group
assignment. Prior to randomisation, it was the responsibility
of the study sites’staff and the primary investigator to ensure
continued eligibility for study participation. At the point of
entering a qualified subject into the study, site staff verified
that the informed consent form had been signed and then
conducted subject randomisation by pulling the next envelope
in the sequential order.
Treatment phase
After completion of the screening phase, patients with contin-
ued eligibility entered the 12 -week treatment phase of the study
and were randomised to one of two groups: the EpiFix group or
the standard care group. Those in the EpiFix group received up
to 12 weekly applications of the EpiFix allograft, in addition
to standard moist wound dressings and multilayer compres-
sion bandages. As the allograft is available in multiple sizes,
an appropriately sized graft was selected to minimise waste
of the EpiFix allograft material. After removal from the ster-
ile pouch, or vial, the allograft was placed on the wound after
sharp/mechanical debridement as deemed necessary to achieve
a well-vascularised, stable wound bed with minimal exudate.
Non-adherent moist wound dressings were placed over the allo-
graft, followed by dry gauze wrap and multilayer compression.
Subjects in the standard care group received moist wound
dressings (ADAPTIC TOUCH™ – primary wound contact
layer and TIELLE® Max Non-Adhesive Hydropolymer dress-
ing – absorbent secondary dressing) and continuation of mul-
tilayer compression bandages.
Subjects in both groups had a weekly study visit for ulcer
assessment, cleaning and debridement (as needed if unhealed),
measurement and photos (post-debridement). Adverse events

Efficacy of EpiFix for treatment of venous leg ulcers
were also assessed weekly. All subjects were instructed on
proper dressing care and the importance of keeping the sec-
ondary dressings and the wound area dry at all times.
Study patients were followed for 16 weeks after randomi-
sation, consisting of 12 weekly treatment visits and one
follow-up visit at 16 weeks. Subjects who achieved healing
before 12 weeks were required to continue to be seen at the
study site weekly for all 12 visits and return at week 16 to
ensure that their wound remained healed. Standard care group
subjects whose VLU wound area did not decrease in area by
at least 40% by week 8 were classified as study failures and
were allowed to receive advanced treatments. For patients with
missing observations, the last known value was carried forward
to study completion. At any point during the treatment period,
a subject could refuse to participate or withdraw from the study
without prejudice.
Study outcomes
The primary end point of the study was time to complete wound
closure, as assessed over a 12 -week period from treatment initi-
ation. Secondary end points included the proportion of subjects
with complete wound closure by 12 and 16 weeks. Complete
healing of the study ulcer was defined as 100% reepithelialisa-
tion without drainage. The incidence of all treatment-emergent
adverse events and serious adverse events, as well as major
complications (product-related), were tracked and compared
between the two treatment groups.
Validation of healing and adjudication of adverse events
The trajectory of wound closure and healing status for each
subject was adjudicated and confirmed by a group of three
wound care specialists blinded to the treatment group. These
blinded independent physicians reviewed all wound images to
ensure standardisation of wound measurements across study
sites. All adverse events and serious adverse events reported by
the study sites were reviewed by a Clinical Events Committee
to determine if the event could be treatment-related.
Statistical methods
Sample size calculations were based on a two-sided log-rank
test for comparing proportions of subjects within each study
group demonstrating improvement in the primary outcome
measure. Calculations were performed using PASS 13 Soft-
ware. A two-sided log rank test with an overall sample size of
120 subjects (of which 60 are in group 1 and 60 are in group 2)
achieves approximately 87% power at a 5% significance level to
detect a difference of 30% between the proportions of subjects
whose ulcers are unhealed by 12 weeks in the subject group
receiving EpiFix or standard care.
The study hypothesis tested was that the use of EpiFix offers
a statistically significant advantage over standard care alone for
the treatment of VLUs. Study variables were summarised as
means and standard deviations (SDs) for continuous variables,
unless the data were non-normal, in which case, medians were
also reported, and proportions/percentages were reported for
categorical variables. Parametric and non-parametric tests
were used as appropriate. Student’
s t-test, Analysis of Covari-
ance (ANCOVA) or the Kruskal–Wallis test was used to
test for differences in continuous variables. For categorical
variables, 𝜒2 or Fisher’
s exact tests were performed to test
for statistical differences. Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox
proportional-hazards regression modelling was performed,
with two-sided P-values <0⋅05 considered significant. The
model included fixed effects for treatment, with baseline size
and duration of ulcer, age, body mass index (BMI), gender,
smoking and alcohol use, medical history, race and ulcer
location as covariates. SAS® 9.4 (SAS institute, Inc., Cary,
NC, USA) was used to perform statistical testing.
Results
In total, 189 subjects were screened and entered the study for
the 2 -week run-in period between 19 March 2015 and 3 March
2017. At the conclusion of the run-in period, 61 patients were
no longer eligible for randomisation. There were 128 patients
randomised: 64 to the EpiFix group and 64 to the standard
care group. Of the subjects, 19 were excluded from analy-
sis, 12 from the EpiFix group and 7 from the control group.
Nine randomised subjects were excluded from final analysis
due to absolute protocol deviations. Absolute protocol devia-
tions were defined as: (i) not meeting the study inclusion criteria
(n = 2), (ii) presence of exclusion criteria at time of randomisa-
tion (n = 0) or (iii) failure of study site or study subject to ade-
quately follow procedures outlined in the study protocol (n = 7).
Additionally, seven subjects had to be withdrawn early due to
non-study-related serious adverse events precluding their abil-
ity to participate in the study or the collection of ongoing data.
Finally, three subjects withdrew their consent and discontinued
their participation. After these exclusions, a total of 109 sub-
jects were included for analysis: 52 received EpiFix, and 57
received standard care.
Study population
Descriptive demographics and wound characteristics of the
study population are presented in Table 1. In the final study
population (n = 109), the majority (79%) of subjects were Cau-
casian. Patient age ranged from 29 to 93 years, with a median
age of 60. Two-thirds (66%) were male, 31% were diagnosed
with diabetes, and 71% were obese (BMI ≥30). The study
groups were well matched for clinical factors, including pres-
ence of comorbidities as well as location, duration and size of
the study ulcer.
Study outcomes
Within 12 weeks of randomisation, 31 of 52 (60%) VLU
patients receiving EpiFix completely healed compared with a
healing rate of 20 of 57 (35%) in those treated with standard
care alone (P = 0⋅0128). At the 16 -week follow-up visit, com-
plete VLU healing was observed in 37 of 52 (71%) and 25 of
57 (44%) of those treated with EpiFix or standard care, respec-
tively (P = 0⋅00625). Mean percentage reduction in wound area
within 12 weeks was 66% for EpiFix-treated wounds and 40%
for wounds not treated with EpiFix. At week 16, mean VLU

area was reduced by 72% for EpiFix-treated wounds com-
pared to 39% with standard care. While adjusting for baseline
wound size, we see that the week 12 adjusted mean for Epi-
Fix (2⋅82 cm2) is significantly lower than the week 12 adjusted
mean for standard care (4⋅81 cm2), with a P-value of 0⋅0435.
Likewise, we see that the week 16 adjusted mean for EpiFix
(2⋅28 cm2) is significantly lower than the week 16 adjusted
mean for standard care (4⋅90 cm2), with a P-value of 0⋅0098.
Cox regression modelling
Cox regression modelling was performed to examine factors
influencing VLU healing within the 12 -week treatment period.
The following covariates were entered as a block into the Cox
regression model: patient age; BMI; ulcer duration; baseline
wound size (continuous variables); treatment group; Caucasian
race; Hispanic ethnicity; male gender; hypertension history;
diabetes history; smoking; alcohol use; history of recurrent
ulcers; and VLU side (left/right), wound location and position
(categorical variables). Log transformations were applied to
baseline wound size, BMI and ulcer duration. The initial model
(Model 1) had an Akaike information criterion (AIC) value of
414⋅76. Table 2 shows the corresponding hazard ratios (HRs)
for the covariates in the initial model. Model refinement was
then carried out by eliminating stepwise covariates with the
highest (non-significant) P values. Model 2 included only those
factors that had a significant impact on healing in Model 1
(treatment with EpiFix, hypertension history, ulcer duration
and baseline wound size). The final model proves to be more
parsimonious with fewer parameters and a lower AIC value,
with an AIC value of 398⋅85. Table 3 shows the corresponding
hazard ratios for the covariates in Model 2 and represents
the definitive Cox regression results. Treatment with EpiFix
was the factor most likely to influence complete healing in
the study population. Wounds treated with EpiFix were 2⋅26
times more likely to heal within 12 weeks than wounds treated
with standard care alone. The presence of hypertension also
had a positive effect on healing, while not surprisingly, wound
duration and wound size negatively influenced healing within
the 12 -week study period.
Kaplan–Meier curve
A Kaplan–Meier plot of time to heal within 12 weeks by study
group demonstrated a superior wound-healing trajectory for
EpiFix compared to VLUs treated with standard care alone.
The log-rank test of equality of the healing function over the
two study groups produced a chi-square test statistic of 6⋅4597,
with P = 0⋅011 (Figure 1).

care group who did not achieve 40% wound reduction by week
8 and were allowed to exit the study to receive advanced wound
care treatment. These subjects continued to be followed up
and classified as study completers. Their non-healed status
at 8 weeks with standard care was pulled forward for final
analysis. At weeks 12 and 16, only one patient in this group
had healed.
Adverse events
Any untoward medical occurrence that was not recorded as a
pre-existing condition was recorded as an adverse event. An
adverse event was recorded as serious if it was a life-threatening
event, resulted in death, required hospitalisation or resulted in
significant disability. All adverse events were reviewed by the
primary investigator at the site and a Clinical Events Committee
to determine if the event was product- or study-related. Overall,
there were 35 adverse events in subjects receiving EpiFix and 30
in subjects receiving standard care, P = 0⋅171. Of the 35 events
in the EpiFix group, nine were classified as severe, while in the
standard care group, 4 of 30 were severe, P = 0⋅140. Adverse
events classified by system are reported in Table 4. None of the
adverse events or serious adverse events was determined by the

Discussion
Rapid and complete healing is the primary goal when treating
a VLU. The longer it takes to heal an ulcer, the greater the
financial burdens to the health care system as well as finan-
cial and personal burdens for the patient (25). The standard
first-line treatment of a VLU includes debridement, wound
dressings and aggressive compression therapy. However, less
than 50% of VLUs will heal within 3 months even with this
comprehensive clinical approach (10). Clinicians must consider
advanced therapies such as biological dressings when first-line
treatments fail, yet there is little published evidence and a gen-
eral lack of high-level supportive evidence regarding efficacy
of advanced treatments for VLUs. The purpose of the present
multicentre study was to evaluate the efficacy of using a dehy-
drated human amnion/chorion membrane allograft (EpiFix) in
addition to standard comprehensive wound care (debridement,
moist dressings and compression) as a treatment for VLUs.
Our results show that EpiFix-treated VLUs experienced signif-
icantly greater rates of complete healing and a lessened time to
healing compared with VLUs receiving standard moist dress-
ings and compression alone.
This is the second multicentre, randomised, controlled trial
to examine the use of EpiFix as a treatment for VLUs. In 2014,
Serena et al. published results of an 84-patient study of Epi-
Fix and multilayer compression versus multilayer compression
alone as a treatment for VLUs (26). In that study, the percent-
age of wound closure at 4 weeks was used as a surrogate end
point, and complete wound closure after a longer interval was
not examined. After 4 weeks, and a maximum of only two Epi-
Fix applications, 62% of subjects in the treatment group and
32% of subjects in the control group demonstrated a greater
than 40% wound closure (P = 0⋅005), thus demonstrating a sig-
nificantly greater velocity of healing for subjects treated with
EpiFix in addition to multilayer compression (26). These ear-
lier results compare favourably to the current 16 -week study
that examined complete wound closure in addition to velocity

of healing, and provide additional evidence of the efficacy of
EpiFix as a treatment for VLUs.
Randomised controlled trials, considered the gold standard
of research methods, provide evidence of the efficacy of a
treatment or intervention under distinct inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria, while observational data are used to measure the
effectiveness of treatment in broader clinical settings. However,
observational studies often include patients who would have
been excluded from a randomised trial and may be confounded
by uncontrolled data collection methods. For the results of a
randomised trial to have external validity, it is important to
evaluate what types of patients were enrolled in the trial and
if these study subjects possess the cacophony of comorbidi-
ties frequently observed by health care providers when treating
patients in the community setting.
The results of the present study are even more impressive
given the broad inclusion criteria that allowed for the enrol-
ment of subjects with frequently observed severe comorbidities,
including diabetes (regardless of level of blood glucose con-
trol), cardiovascular conditions, musculoskeletal abnormalities,
smoking history, advanced age, extreme obesity, wound size up
to 25 cm2, history of recurrent ulceration and no limit as to how
long the study ulcer had remained unhealed. The number of
adverse events and serious adverse events observed in the cur-
rent study population provides further evidence as to the high
level of acuity and presence of comorbidities in study subjects,
especially with regards to the fact that no events were attributed
to EpiFix or study procedures. Clinicians and health policy
makers are provided an additional level of assurance regarding
the effectiveness of EpiFix and the likelihood that these results
can be generalised, given the large number of clinical study sites
and broad patient population included in the present study.
A comparative effectiveness review by Zenilman et al. in
2013 concluded that most interventions used in the man-
agement of chronic VLUs lack evidence in the form of
high-quality randomised controlled trials to support the fact
that their use provides additional benefits over compression
therapy alone (27). Zenilman’
s examination of biological dress-
ings included a review of published evidence for TheraSkin®
(Soluble Systems, Newport News, VA, USA), Integra™
(Integra LifeSciences, Plainsboro, NJ, USA), Apligraf® and
Dermagraft® (Organogenesis, Canton, MA, USA). They were
unable to conclude the effectiveness of TheraSkin, Integra and
Dermagraft due to insufficient evidence but concluded that
there was moderate evidence to support the use of Apligraf as
a treatment for chronic VLUs (27).
Both Dermagraft and Apligraf have been studied for their
efficacy in treating VLUs. A randomised pilot study by Krish-
namoorthy et al. examined healing rates over 12 weeks in 99
patients treated with 12, 4 or 1 application of Dermagraft and
in one group receiving compression only (28). No statistically
significant differences were observed in healing rates among the
groups. Of patients receiving either 12 or 4 Dermagraft appli-
cations, 38% were reported healed at 12 weeks (28). This rate
of healing is similar to that found by Harding et al. in a study of
366 patients, where 64 of 186 patients (34%) in the Dermagraft
group were healed by week 12, compared with 56 of 180 (31%)
of patients receiving compression alone, P = 0⋅235 (29). In the
current study, complete healing rates observed at 12 weeks in
the EpiFix-treated group were 60%.
A 275-patient, randomised study by Falanga, published
nearly 20 years ago in 1998, examined the use of Apligraf as a
treatment for VLUs (30). Rates of VLU healing after 6 months
(24 weeks) of treatment were 63% (92/146) with Apligraf and
49% (63/129) with compression alone, P = 0⋅02 (30). Falanga
did not report healing rates at week 12, yet interestingly, their
reported healing rate of 63% at 24 weeks with Apligraf cor-
responds to the week 12 healing rate of 60% with EpiFix.
The healing results observed with EpiFix within 12 weeks are
even more remarkable given that Falanga reported a mean
wound size of 1⋅33 ± 2⋅69 cm2 for Apligraf-treated subjects,
and excluded patients with uncontrolled diabetes and other clin-
ically significant medical conditions that could impair wound
healing, while in the current EpiFix study, patients with these
types of comorbidities were included, and mean wound size was
considerably larger at 7⋅6 ± 6⋅1 cm2.
Marston et al. performed a retrospective comparative effec-
tiveness study that included 1801 refractory VLUs treated
with Apligraf or Oasis (Smith & Nephew, London, UK)
(31). Although Kaplan–Meier estimates found that healing

Efficacy of EpiFix for treatment of venous leg ulcers
Figure 2 Comparison of 12 -week healing
rates reported in published randomised tri-
als using EpiFix (current study), Apligraf
(31,32) or Dermagraft (28,29) as a treat-
ment for VLUs.
rates with Apligraf were significantly greater than with Oasis
(P = 0⋅01), overall VLU healing rates at 12 weeks were only
31% and 26% for Apligraf and Oasis, respectively (31). The
12 -week healing results reported with these products by
Marston et al. are lower than the healing rate at 12 weeks
reported in the current study with standard care (debridement,
moist dressings and compression) alone (35%). When com-
paring the results of the current study where 60% of VLUs
treated with EpiFix were healed completely within 12 weeks,
healing rates with Apligraf only reached 61% after 36 weeks.
Additional information on healing rates achieved at 12 weeks
with Apligraf is presented in the products’instructions for use
(32). VLU healing rates at 12 weeks reported for Apligraf, Der-
magraft and EpiFix are presented in Figure 2. These results are
not surprising in that previously published randomised, con-
trolled, comparative studies examining EpiFix, Apligraf and
standard care for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers showed
superiority of healing metrics with EpiFix over Apligraf and
standard care (23,24).
A strength of the present study is its randomised, multicentre
design. Although patients and caregivers were unable to be
blinded to group assignment, the Silhouette camera was used
at all study sites to provide for the objective measurement
of wound area. To reduce potential bias, a group of three
physicians, blinded to study site and patient group assignment,
adjudicated each patient record and examined wound images to
determine final healing status.
As there are limitations to every study, we acknowledge that
our results may not be generalised to other amniotic mem-
brane products seeing that scientific papers have been published
describing differences among the products (33). It must also
be recognised that all patients received a high level of care in
a wound care centre. For ethical reasons, per study protocol,
patients receiving standard care were allowed to exit the study
and receive advanced wound care treatments if their wound did
not reduce by a minimum of 40% within 8 weeks of study enrol-
ment. Although these subjects were classified as non-healers in
the final analysis due to their status at 8 weeks, they continued
to be followed up, with only one patient having complete heal-
ing at weeks 12 and 16. It should be noted that the study results
remain unchanged and statistically significant even when these
censored data are included.
In conclusion, VLUs treated with EpiFix as an adjunct
to debridement, moist wound dressings and compression
had significantly higher rates of healing than those treated
comprehensive wound care alone. VLU healing rates of 60%
within 12 weeks and 71% within 16 weeks are superior to
healing rates reported in studies of other advanced wound
care products. The results of this 109-patient, multicentre, ran-
domised, controlled study provide additional Level I evidence
regarding the efficacy of EpiFix and are useful to clinicians
who are determining a treatment plan for VLUs and for health
care policy makers in both the USA and global marketplace
evaluating the benefits of advanced wound care products.
