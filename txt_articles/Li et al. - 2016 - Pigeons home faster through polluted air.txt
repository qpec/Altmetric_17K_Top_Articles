Pigeons home faster through 
polluted air
Zhongqiu Li1,2, Franck Courchamp2,3,4 & Daniel T. Blumstein2
Air pollution, especially haze pollution, is creating health issues for both humans and other animals. 
However, remarkably little is known about how animals behaviourally respond to air pollution. We 
used multiple linear regression to analyse 415 pigeon races in the North China Plain, an area with 
considerable air pollution, and found that while the proportion of pigeons successfully homed was not 
influenced by air pollution, pigeons homed faster when the air was especially polluted. Our results may 
be explained by an enhanced homing motivation and possibly an enriched olfactory environment that 
facilitates homing. Our study provides a unique example of animals’ response to haze pollution; future 
studies are needed to identify proposed mechanisms underlying this effect.
Air pollution, especially haze pollution, has become a global environmental problem and the situation is much 
more serious in rapidly developing countries, such as China1,2, India3, Mexico4, etc. A large literature has doc-
umented deleterious effects of pollution on humans, such as increased incidences of heart disease, lung cancer, 
and high blood pressure5,6. Based on these risks, public health officials have suggested that people reduce or avoid 
outdoor activities to protect their health when the air is heavily polluted. However, much less is known about how 
non-human animals react to air pollution.
Due to their higher metabolic rate and special respiratory system, birds should be particularly sensitive to air 
pollution7,8 and, like in humans, air pollution has been documented to cause serious health problems for birds7,9. 
For instance, the accumulation of heavy metals and fine particles results in liver and lung damage9–11 and may 
affect flying ability. Moreover, birds’ navigation, which relies in part on visual or olfactory cues12,13, might also 
be affected by air pollution, because of the reduced visibility or chemical interference under conditions of heavy 
haze pollution14,15.
Homing pigeons are an ideal model system to study the effects of air pollution on bird behaviour. Pigeon 
navigation mechanisms are well-studied: pigeons use solar and geomagnetic cues as a compass to determine the 
direction to home, and they use olfactory and visual cues as a map to determine their position in space16,17. Thus, 
we might expect that pollution would negatively interfere with pigeon navigation and pigeons would both fly more 
slowly and be less successful at returning to their home roosts when flying through more polluted air. To test this 
hypothesis, we used a large data set generated by 415 pigeon races on the North China Plain, an area with China’s 
worst air pollution, to evaluate the effects of air pollution on pigeons’ homing performance.
Results
Based on the availability of both environmental and racing data, we used each race as a unit of analysis and 
created a data set of 415 pigeon races on the North China Plain (Table 1). Four variables significantly affected 
pigeon homing time: average beeline distance (β 
 ± 
 SE = 
 0.016 ± 
 0.001, t = 
 34.104, P < 
 0.01), wind direc-
tion (β

 ± 
 SE = 
 −0.002 ± 
 0.001, t = 
 −3.262, P < 
 0.01). Temperature 
(β

 − 
0.003 ± 
 0.008, t = 
 − 
0.394, P = 
 0.69) had no significant effects on homing time (Fig. 1). The model 
including all the above factors explained 96.4% of the total variance in pigeon homing time. Using our mod-
el’s parameter estimates to estimate homing speed, pigeons are predicted to increase their homing speed from 
55.6 km/h when AQI = 
 0, to 68.2 km/h when AQI = 
 500; an increase of 22.7% when flying the median distance 
(300 km), under variable wind and through cloudy weather (Fig. 2).
The linear regression model of homing rate revealed significant effects of the intercept (β

 6.366, 
t =  8.635, P <  0.01) and wind direction (β  ±  SE =  5.734 ±  1.506, t =  3.809, P <  0.01). Temperature

Discussion
A number of studies have identified negative effects of anthropogenic features on the speed and success with 
which birds return home18,19. Indeed, we initially expected that pigeons would home more slowly due to the low 
visibility and potential negative health effects associated with air pollution. Contrary to our expectations, pigeons 
homed significantly faster when flying through more polluted conditions. We suggest two possible mechanisms to 
account for these unexpected findings: navigation ability and motivation13,20. It is generally accepted that pigeons 
use a two-step process to navigate, they use the sun and the geomagnetic field as a compass and they use visual and 
olfactory cues to create a map13,16. Could air pollution enhance pigeon visual and/or olfactory abilities, and by doing 
so explain the reduced homing time? Air pollution is usually associated with low visibility, particularly in North 
China where particulate matters are the main pollutants15,21. Decreased homing time under increased air pollution 
would suggest that the use of landmarks and visual cues for navigation might be important but not fundamental. 
This finding is consistent with previous studies that have shown that pigeons are able to home perfectly well from 
unknown sites where landmarks are unfamiliar13, even when flying with frosted lenses that impede vision22.
Olfactory cues have been shown to play an important role in avian navigation, and in pigeons it is probably 
a fundamental homing mechanism13,16. While air pollution cannot enhance vision, it might enhance olfactory 
navigation efficiency by providing supplemental olfactory cues to home. In Beijing, haze pollution is produced 
from several sources including coal burning, biomass burning, etc.2. As suggested by Wallraff and Andreae23, the 
majority of volatiles present in the air are of anthropogenic origin, and these organic and inorganic compounds 
could be potentially used for odour-based navigation. Further support for improved olfactory navigation under 
pollution requires identifying the precise chemical cues that pigeons use for navigation, and then demonstrating 
that these are associated with haze pollution. With respect to weather and wind direction, we found that pigeons 
homed faster on sunny days and when flying with a tailwind. This is likely due to both the availability of the sun 
compass and a boost in flight speed from a tailwind24,25. Wind direction also affected homing rate. Pigeons were 
more successful in returning to their home lofts when flying with a tailwind, likely because a tailwind provides 
mechanical support, thereby increasing homing speed and homing rate24,25.
Alternatively, decreased homing time under air pollution could be explained by an enhanced motivation to 
home; a possibility proposed several years ago that remains untested13. Prolonged exposure to polluted air could 
be detrimental to an individual’s health. For example, particulate matters2, the main pollutants in North China, 
have been shown to impede pigeon pulmonary function11. Thus, air pollution might be an indication of poor 
environmental quality, which might trigger rapid escape26,27. Motivation to home could also be enhanced if the 
reduced visibility under haze pollution15 increases predation risk because it interferes with the ability of pigeons 
to detect predators from afar28,29. Thus, by homing faster when flying through haze pollution, pigeons reduce the

relative amount of time they are exposed to harmful or dangerous situations while away from the safety of their 
home roosts.
In conclusion, our results suggest that pigeons homed faster when flying through highly polluted air. We 
explained this finding by suggesting that pollution may enhance pigeons’ motivation to reduce exposure to health 
or predation risks associated with polluted air or the accompanying reduced visibility. An alternative hypothesis 
is that pollution enhanced olfactory navigation abilities, which provides more concentrated chemical volatiles that 
can be used by pigeons to build up an effective olfactory map. To discriminate between these alternative hypotheses, 
future studies should determine whether the reduced homing times result from increased flight speeds or from 
straighter flights. This could then help determine whether pollution increases the motivation to home (if the flight 
speed is increased, or resting time is decreased), and/or navigation performance (if flights are straighter and less 
tortuous). In addition, the possibility that pigeons could perceive a health risk associated with air pollution and fly 
faster as a result is an intriguing, new idea for environmental and human health, and would benefit from further 
testing in other non-human species.
Materials and Methods
Racing data. 
We obtained racing data from the public website of the Chinese Racing Pigeon Association 
(CRPA, http://www.crpa.net.cn/). For each race, data include city of the home loft and the city of release site, 
release time, arrival time of each pigeon, average beeline distance from the release site to the home lofts, number 
of pigeons released, and number of pigeons successfully returned. The homeward direction from the release 
site to the centre of the home lofts was calculated and categorised as North, Northeast, East, Southeast, South, 
Southwest, West, and Northwest. The distance (in km) of each race was calculated as the average of all returned 
pigeons.
Data focused the North China Plain, an area with the worst air pollution and for which the new Air Quality 
Index (AQI)1 – which integrates the most important haze source – PM2.5 – has been available since 2013. We 
focused on racing data from the fall of 2013 and 2014 because this is the time of year with the worst air quality30, 
and over half of the racing events are held during the fall. More importantly, pigeons behave differently between 
seasons31, and thus to eliminate variation, we focused on fall racing events. Since racing pigeons fly at an average 
of 60 km/h, and they are released mostly in the early morning, we eliminated races over 470 km to ensure that most 
pigeons potentially could return to their home lofts in the same day. The shortest race was 160 km long. Distances 
between different lofts were thus usually small compared to the race length, i.e., within 30 km. With these criteria, 
we created a data set of 415 races (Supplemental file 1).
Air Quality Index. 
We obtained Air Quality Index (AQI) data from the Data Centre of the Ministry of 
Environmental Protection of the People’s Republic of China (MEP, http://datacenter.mep.gov.cn/), or from related 
provincial or city meteorological departments. Based on established criteria (GB3095-2012), AQI is calculated 
for six major air pollutants separately: particle matter < 
10 microns in diameter (PM10), particle matter < 
2.5 
microns in diameter (PM2.5), ground-level ozone level (O3), carbon monoxide (CO) level, sulphur dioxide level 
(SO2), and nitrogen dioxide level (NO2). An individual score is assigned to the level of each pollutant and the 
final AQI is the highest of those 6 scores. AQI values range from 0 to 500, and can be classified into six categories 
(Good: 0–50, Moderate: 51–100, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups: 101–150, Unhealthy: 151–200, Very Unhealthy: 
200–300, Hazardous: 301–500). In China, particulate pollution poses the greatest threat to human health in 
China, and AQI is well predicted by the concentrations of PM10 (r = 
 0.988, P < 
 0.01) and PM2.5 (r = 
 0.983, 
P < 
 0.01, Supplemental file 2).
Since all races were held in North China Plain, which is a broad plain without any geological obstructions, and 
the air quality is similar in adjacent cities32, we recorded the AQI at both the sites of release and the home lofts 
(if there were no AQI reports at either the release site or home lofts, we used AQI of the closest city; a distance 
<50 km). AQI levels at the release site and home lofts were positively correlated (r = 
 0.424, P < 
 0.01), so we used 
the average AQI to represent the pigeon’s air environment during a race.
Meteorological variables. 
We obtained meteorological data from a public weather website (http://www.
tianqihoubao.com/). We collated weather conditions, wind direction and ground air temperature (°C) at both the 
release and home lofts. Based on these data, we defined the weather conditions at the time of each race as: sunny, 
if both sites were sunny; cloudy, if either site was cloudy; and overcast or rainy (hereafter “rainy”), if either site was 
overcast or rainy. Precise information on wind speed was unavailable, so we focused on wind direction, which was 
classified into three categories: tailwind, when wind direction was the same as the direction of the birds’ flight at 
both release and home sites; headwind, a wind direction opposite to the birds’ flight directions at both sites; and 
variable, which included all other possible combinations of directions. We assumed that temperature increased 
smoothly from the lowest at sunrise (06:00 in September; 06:30 in October; 07:00 in November) to the highest 
at 14:00 and then decreased similarly. Then we calculated the average temperature of each race using the corre-
sponding average homing times.
Data analysis. 
We tested two hypotheses: under conditions of low visibility and olfactory interference asso-
ciated with air pollution, pigeons would 1) increase their homing time and 2) decrease their homing rate (the 
percentage of pigeons successfully homed). To avoid a ratio-correlation problem that inevitably occurs when 
searching for relationships between speed (distance/time) and distance where distance appears on both sides of 
the equation33, we fitted a linear model using average homing time of each race as the dependent variable. Average 
beeline distance, weather, wind, AQI, temperature were defined as independent variables, and the intercept was 
set at 0. In the second linear model, we used the homing rate (percentage) as the dependent variable, and dis-
tance, weather, wind, AQI and temperature as independent factors. For categorical variables, we defined weather

as sunny = 
 1, cloudy = 
 2, and rainy = 
 3, which indicated an increase of clouds cover, and wind as tailwind = 
 1, 
variable = 
 0, and headwind = 
 − 
1, which indicated an effect of wind direction on flight difficulty. We did not 
include home city, homing direction and year in the final regression model, because we found no effects of city 
(F6,397 = 
 1.692, P = 
 0.12) or homing direction (F3,397 = 
 1.302, P = 
 0.27) on homing time in a preliminary analysis. 
Year (2013, 2014) explained significant variation in homing time (F1,397 = 
 9.885, P < 
 0.01), but since it was not the 
aim of our study to predict homing time in specific years, we excluded it from the final model. Individual pigeons 
vary in homing experience, and some pigeons are probably trained for uni-direction, which might bias their 
directional decision. Since we knew nothing about prior homing or training experience, we focused on homing 
time and homing rate, which are characteristics of a race, not an individual. Finally, we plotted the relationship 
between average actual homing speed and AQI, and we estimated the homing speed (beeline distance/homing 
time) using our regression model for three distances (200 km, 300 km, 400 km), under three weather conditions 
(sunny, cloudy, rainy), and three wind conditions (tailwind, headwind, variable). We reported coefficient val-
ues ± 
 standard error. All analyses were conducted with SPSS 18.0.
