BACKGROUND
Adalimumab, a fully human anti–tumor necrosis factor α monoclonal antibody, is 
effective in the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). We tested the effi-
cacy of adalimumab in the treatment of JIA-associated uveitis.
METHODS
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we assessed 
the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in children and adolescents 2 years of age 
or older who had active JIA-associated uveitis. Patients who were taking a stable 
dose of methotrexate were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either adalimu-
mab (at a dose of 20 mg or 40 mg, according to body weight) or placebo, adminis-
tered subcutaneously every 2 weeks. Patients continued the trial regimen until treat-
ment failure or until 18 months had elapsed. They were followed for up to 2 years 
after randomization. The primary end point was the time to treatment failure, 
defined according to a multicomponent intraocular inflammation score that was 
based on the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature criteria.
RESULTS
The prespecified stopping criteria were met after the enrollment of 90 of 114 pa-
tients. We observed 16 treatment failures in 60 patients (27%) in the adalimumab 
group versus 18 treatment failures in 30 patients (60%) in the placebo group 
(hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12 to 0.49; P<0.0001 [the pre-
specified stopping boundary]). Adverse events were reported more frequently in 
patients receiving adalimumab than in those receiving placebo (10.07 events per 
patient-year [95% CI, 9.26 to 10.89] vs. 6.51 events per patient-year [95% CI, 5.26 to 
7.77]), as were serious adverse events (0.29 events per patient-year [95% CI, 0.15 
to 0.43] vs. 0.19 events per patient-year [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.40]).
CONCLUSIONS
Adalimumab therapy controlled inflammation and was associated with a lower 
rate of treatment failure than placebo among children and adolescents with active 
JIA-associated uveitis who were taking a stable dose of methotrexate. Patients who 
received adalimumab had a much higher incidence of adverse events and serious 
adverse events than those who received placebo. (Funded by the NIHR Health Tech-

J
uvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is the 
most common rheumatic disease in children. 
Children with JIA are at risk for inflamma-
tion of the uvea (uveitis). Uveitis develops in ap-
proximately 12 to 38% of patients with JIA within 
7 years after the onset of arthritis.1,2 Despite 
current screening and therapeutic options, visual 
impairment in both eyes may develop in up to 
15% of children with JIA-associated uveitis, and 
they may be certified as legally blind.3,4
Experimental models of autoimmune uveitis 
have shown that tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) 
plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis,5 findings 
that have been borne out in the treatment of 
uveitis in adults6-8 and in pediatric case series.9-17 
Adalimumab is a fully humanized anti–TNF-α 
monoclonal antibody. A multicenter, randomized, 
double-blind, parallel-group trial showed a sig-
nificant benefit of adalimumab in children with 
active rheumatoid arthritis.18 We carried out the 
SYCAMORE trial to assess the role of adalimu-
mab in the treatment of methotrexate-refractory 
JIA-associated uveitis.
Methods
Protocol and Trial Population
In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial, the primary end point 
was the efficacy of adalimumab in children with 
active JIA-associated uveitis, as measured by 
various scoring systems. All the patients had 
been receiving a stable weekly dose of metho-
trexate for at least 12 weeks.
An independent ethics committee and the 
Medicines for Healthcare Products Regulatory 
Agency approved the trial protocol (available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Each 
parent or guardian provided written informed 
consent, and each child gave assent when ap-
propriate. The authors vouch for the fidelity of 
this report and the trial to the protocol. AbbVie 
provided the active drug and placebo that were 
used in the trial. AbbVie had no part in the trial 
design, the collection or analysis of the data, or 
the preparation of the manuscript. AbbVie repre-
sentatives reviewed the final draft of the manu-
script. All the authors assume responsibility for 
the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses. University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foun-
dation Trust, as the sponsor of this trial, has a 
data-sharing agreement with AbbVie in support 
of regulatory purposes.
Children and adolescents 2 years of age or 
older who had active JIA-associated uveitis were 
eligible to undergo randomization. Stable metho-
trexate treatment meant that the dose (10 to 20 mg 
per square meter of body-surface area; maxi-
mum dose, 25 mg) and the method of adminis-
tration remained constant. Active uveitis was 
defined as a sustained grade (on at least two 
occasions) of cellular infiltrate in the anterior 
chamber of 1+ (indicating 6 to 15 cells in a 
1-mm2 area of the anterior chamber of the eye 
under a slit-lamp biomicroscope) or higher, ac-
cording to the Standardization of Uveitis Nomen-
clature (SUN) criteria,19 during the 12 weeks 
before screening despite receipt of methotrexate 
and glucocorticoid (systemic or topical) therapy. 
The SUN cell-activity score is proportional to the 
approximate number of cells per 1 mm2 in the 
anterior chamber of the eye under a slit-lamp 
biomicroscope, with a higher score indicating a 
greater number of cells.19 There are no interna-
tionally agreed-on minimally important differ-
ences for this scale.
Key exclusion criteria were previous exposure 
to adalimumab, previous exposure to another 
biologic agent such that the estimated level of 
the drug in the patient’s blood was less than that 
predicted by 5 half-lives of the drug, receipt of 
more than six topical glucocorticoid drops per 
eye per day, and receipt of prednisone (or the 
equivalent) at a dose exceeding 0.2 mg per kilo-
gram of body weight per day. The full inclusion 
and exclusion criteria and information regarding 
the concomitant medications that were and were 
not permitted are described in the trial protocol.20
Randomization and Trial Procedures
Randomization was performed with the use of a 
Web-based system with random permuted block 
sizes of 3 and 6, stratified according to trial 
center. At enrollment, eligible patients were as-
signed in a 2:1 ratio to receive adalimumab or 
placebo. Patients were followed for 2 years after 
randomization. Trial visits were scheduled at 4, 
8, and 12 weeks and then every 12 weeks until 
18 months or until patients stopped the trial 
regimen because of treatment failure, after which 
they were followed for another 6 months.
Ophthalmic assessment of disease activity and 
ocular complications were measured throughout 
the trial with the use of slit-lamp biomicroscopy 
for uveitis activity, according to the SUN criteria19

Adalimumab plus Methotrexate for JIA-Associated Uveitis
able at NEJM.org). The primary and secondary end 
points were assessed at each trial visit and at any 
unscheduled visits.
Trial Regimen
We recruited patients between October 1, 2011, 
and April 10, 2015. The first patient underwent 
randomization on October 27, 2011, and the 
final patient underwent randomization on March 
31, 2015.
All the patients received a stable dose of week-
ly oral or subcutaneous methotrexate (10 to 20 mg 
per square meter; maximum dose, 25 mg). No 
dose reduction or change in the method of ad-
ministration was allowed. An increase in the 
dose was acceptable in response to somatic 
growth (so that the dose per square meter at 
trial entry was maintained throughout the trial) 
but not on clinical grounds. Participants received 
either adalimumab (at a dose of 20 mg in pa-
tients weighing <30 kg or 40 mg in patients 
weighing ≥30 kg), or placebo, administered as a 
subcutaneous injection every 2 weeks. The volume 
(0.8 ml) was the same across all doses and 
groups. AbbVie provided the investigational me-
dicinal product (adalimumab) and matching pla-
cebo in identical, prefilled vials.
Primary End Point
The primary end point was the time to treatment 
failure (as assessed by means of a multicomponent 
intraocular inflammation score), which was de-
fined as at least one of the following criteria 
being met: a two-grade increase from baseline 
in the SUN cell-activity score (anterior chamber 
cell count) over a period of two consecutive 
visits; no change in the SUN cell-activity score in 
patients with an entry grade of 3 or higher for 
two consecutive readings (apart from baseline); 
only partial improvement (decrease of one grade) 
or no change from baseline, with the develop-
ment of another ocular coexisting condition that 
was sustained over a period of two consecutive 
visits; the worsening of an existing (on enroll-
ment) ocular coexisting condition after 3 months; 
an entry grade of 1 or 2 that was still present 
after 6 months of therapy and that had been 
sustained over a period of two consecutive visits; 
the use of ineligible concomitant medications 
(medications not listed in the prespecified ac-
ceptable criteria or those that were not allowed); 
or the intermittent or continuous suspension of 
the trial regimen for a cumulative period of more 
than 4 weeks. All the trial assessments were car-
ried out by persons who did not have knowledge 
of the trial-group assignments.
Secondary End Points
All the secondary end points were assessed at 
each trial visit.20 These end points included the 
use of topical and systemic glucocorticoids; a 
flare of uveitis defined according to SUN crite-
ria; control, remission, and duration of inactive 
disease (uveitis); health-related quality of life, as 
assessed by means of the Childhood Health As-
sessment Questionnaire (CHAQ; scores range 
from 0 to 3, with lower scores indicating better 
outcomes; minimal clinically important differ-
ences, −0.188 for improvement and 0.125 for 
worsening)21 and the Child Health Question-
naire (CHQ; scores range from 0 to 100, with 
higher scores indicating better or more positive 
health states; no specific minimal clinically im-
portant difference is recognized)22; flare of JIA; 
remission while taking medication and remis-
sion while not taking medication23; minimal JIA 
disease activity (defined in patients with oligoar-
ticular JIA as a physician’s global assessment of 
≤2.5 on a 10-cm visual-analogue scale, with 
higher scores indicating more disease activity, 
and no swollen joints; or defined in patients 
with polyarticular JIA as a physician’s global as-
sessment of ≤3.4 on the 10-cm visual-analogue 
scale, the patient’s or parent’s global assessment 
of ≤2.1 on the 10-cm visual-analogue scale, and 
≤1 swollen joint)24; the Juvenile Arthritis Disease 
Activity Score (JADAS),25 which was defined as 
the linear sum of four components: a physician’s 
global assessment on the 10-cm visual-analogue 
scale, the patient’s or parent’s global assessment 
on the 10-cm visual-analogue scale, an active joint 
count as assessed in one of three ways (with any 
involved joints up to a maximum of 10 [JADAS 
10], with 27 joints including the cervical spine, 
elbows, wrists, the first to third metacarpopha-
langeals, proximal interphalangeals, hips, knees, 
and ankles [JADAS 27], or with all 71 joints 
[JADAS 71]); and the erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate (ESR), which was normalized on a scale 
from 0 to 10 with the use of the following for-
mula to avoid excessive weight in the overall 
index: (ESR [mm/hr]

core outcome set variables.26 ACR responses of 
ACR 30, ACR 50, ACR 70, ACR 90, and ACR 100 
are defined as 30%, 50%, 70%, 90% and 100% 
improvement, respectively, in a minimum of three 
variables in the core set, with worsening of 
one variable by no more than 30%, as defined in 
the ACR criteria. The secondary end points and 
the post hoc analyses are provided in Table S8 
in the Supplementary Appendix.
Safety
All the participants who received at least one 
dose of adalimumab or placebo were included in 
the safety analyses. Adverse events were recorded 
at each visit and reported from the receipt of the 
first dose of the trial regimen. Adverse events 
are reported regardless of severity or perceived 
association with the trial intervention. Data on 
serious adverse events were collected from the 
time of informed consent. Adverse events were 
tabulated with the use of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities, version 18.0, system organ 
class and preferred terms.
Statistical Analysis
We originally designed the trial with 90% power 
to detect a 50% relative difference in the rate of 
treatment failure (estimated at 60% with placebo 
vs. 30% with adalimumab) at a two-sided 5% 
significance level. In view of substantial chal-
lenges in the early phases of recruitment, the in-
dependent data and safety monitoring committee 
and the trial steering committee, with approval 
from the trial funders, advised the adoption of a 
protocol amendment that reduced the power to 
80%, required the recruitment of 114 patients 
(76 patients in the adalimumab group and 38 in 
the placebo group), and included a 5% inflation 
for missing data for the primary end point.
In an intention-to-treat analysis of the pri-
mary end point, we used the log-rank test to 
compare the two trial groups and Kaplan–Meier 
plots to show the distribution of time to treat-
ment failure. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence 
intervals were estimated after fitting a Cox pro-
portional-hazards model with the assumption of 
proportional hazards checked by means of the 
addition of a time-dependent treatment-effect 
variable to the model. A two-sided P value of less 
than 0.0001 was used for the Haybittle–Peto 
stopping boundary for the interim analysis, and 
a two-sided P value of less than 0.05 was consid-
ered to indicate statistical significance for the 
final analysis.27 Prespecified sensitivity analyses 
tested the effects of missing data, participants 
who stopped their intervention early, and those 
who had been incorrectly identified as having 
treatment failure. The statistical analysis plan 
(see the protocol) includes the full details of the 
sensitivity analyses. Analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS 
Institute).
Trial Oversight and Trial Stopping
After the second interim analysis, the data and 
safety monitoring committee noted on March 
11, 2015, that the adalimumab group had evi-
dence of a significantly lower risk of treatment

failure than the placebo group. On the basis of 
formal stopping boundaries,27 the data and safety 
monitoring committee recommended that recruit-
ment to the trial should cease, that all partici-
pants should be subsequently made aware of their 
trial-group assignment, that participants in the 
placebo group should cease taking the trial regi-
men and enter trial follow-up, and that partici-
pants receiving adalimumab should continue per 
the trial protocol. After consultation with the 
data and safety monitoring committee, the trial 
steering committee, and the co-chief investiga-
tors (the first and last authors), a decision was 
made to implement this recommendation, with 
the support of the trial team (whose members 
had remained unaware of the trial-group assign-
ments throughout) and with the agreement of 
the trial sponsor and funders.
Patients were called in for a final assessment 
of response by investigators who were unaware 
of the trial-group assignments. Patients in the 
adalimumab group were asked to continue per 
the protocol for the duration of the trial in an 
open-label follow-up until the completion of their 
18-month treatment, the occurrence of an adverse 
event that was attributed to the drug and pre-
cluded continued treatment, or treatment failure. 
All the patients who had received placebo stopped 
taking the trial regimen and completed the 
6-month follow-up phase of the trial. Open-label 
extension of the trial continues.
Results
Patients
Of 332 patients who underwent screening at 14 
sites in the United Kingdom, 242 did not undergo 
randomization because they did not meet the 
inclusion criteria. A total of 60 participants were 
randomly assigned to receive adalimumab and 
30 to receive placebo (Table 1, and Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Data for the primary 
end point were available for all the participants 
who underwent randomization.
Nine patients (15%) in the adalimumab group 
and seven (23%) in the placebo group discontin-
ued the trial intervention for reasons other than 
treatment failure (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Seven of these patients in the adalim-
umab group and six of those in the placebo 
group agreed to subsequent follow-up.
Treatment Failure
The addition of adalimumab to methotrexate sig-
nificantly delayed the time to treatment failure, 
as compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.25; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12 to 0.49; 
P<0.0001 by the log-rank test [the prespecified 
stopping boundary]) (Fig. 1A). During the 
18-month trial period, the median time to treat-
ment failure was not reached in the adalimumab 
group and was 24.1 weeks (95% CI, 12.4 to 81.0) 
in the placebo group (Fig. 1A). Treatment failure 
occurred in a significantly lower percentage of 
patients in the adalimumab group than in the 
placebo group (16 patients [27%] vs. 18 [60%]; 
relative risk, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.73; P 
= 
0.002) 
(Tables S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Nine sensitivity analyses confirmed the con-
clusion found in the primary analysis (Table S5 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Safety and Adverse Events
Summary data of the adverse events are listed in 
Table 2, and serious adverse events are listed in 
Table 3. A total of 588 adverse events, including 
minor infections and respiratory disorders, were 
reported in 53 patients (88%) in the adalimumab 
group, and 103 adverse events were reported in 
25 patients (83%) in the placebo group. The rate 
of serious adverse events was 0.29 events per 
patient-year (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.43) in the adalimu-
mab group, as compared with 0.19 events per 
patient-year (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.40) in the placebo 
group; the corresponding rates of adverse events 
per patient-year were 10.07 (95% CI, 9.26 to 10.89) 
and 6.51 (95% CI, 5.26 to 7.77). Full listings of 
all the adverse events are provided in Tables S6 
and S7 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Secondary End Points
A full summary of the analyses of the secondary 
end points is provided in Table S8 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix. At randomization, six partici-
pants (five in the adalimumab group and one in 
the placebo group) were taking systemic gluco-
corticoids (permitted dose, <0.20 mg per kilo-
gram per day; median dose, 0.14 mg per kilogram 
per day). Three of the participants in the adalimu-
mab group stopped taking systemic glucocorti-
coids (median duration of treatment, 18.1 weeks). 
The patient in the placebo group stopped taking 
systemic glucocorticoids after 5.6 weeks.

Adalimumab plus Methotrexate for JIA-Associated Uveitis
Of 63 participants who were taking two or 
more drops of topical glucocorticoids per day at 
randomization, a significantly greater percent-
age of patients in the adalimumab group than 
in the placebo group had a reduction to less 
than two drops (23 of 45 patients [51%] vs. 3 of 
18 [17%]; hazard ratio for reduction, 3.72; 95% 
CI, 1.09 to 12.71; P 
= 
0.04) (Fig. 1B). Of 74 par-
ticipants who were taking one or more drops at 
randomization, a significantly greater percent-
age of patients had a reduction to zero drops in 
the adalimumab group than in the placebo 
group (23 of 49 patients [47%] vs. 4 of 25 [16%]; 
hazard ratio, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.24 to 10.32; 
P 
= 
0.02) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
Patients in the adalimumab group had a sig-
nificantly longer mean (±SE) duration of sus-
tained inactive disease (zero cells) than did 
those in the placebo group (179.3±16.9 days vs. 
14.5±23.9 days; estimated treatment effect, 164.8 
days; 95% CI, 104.4 to 225.2; P<0.0001 [the pre-
specified stopping boundary]). Patients in the 
adalimumab group took the trial regimen for 
twice as long as those in the placebo group 
(mean [±SD] duration, 315.9±173.8 days vs. 
151.6±150.3 days).
Arthritis flare occurred in no patients in the 
adalimumab group during the trial period, as 
compared with three patients (10%) in the pla-
cebo group (relative risk, 0.07; 95% CI, 0.00 to 
1.36; P 
= 
0.03). Because most of the children en-
tered the trial with minimal arthritis (Table 1), 
the ACR 30, ACR 50, ACR 70, ACR 90, and ACR 
100 values and the JADAS 10, 27, and 71 values 
were only minimally affected (Tables S11 and 
S12 in the Supplementary Appendix). There was 
no significant difference between the two trial 
groups with regard to health-related quality of 
life, as assessed by means of the CHQ and 
CHAQ, across time (Tables S13 and S14 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Post Hoc Analyses
An exploratory analysis of the time to treatment 
response showed a difference between the adali-
mumab group and the placebo group in favor of 
adalimumab (hazard ratio, 3.15; 95% CI, 1.42 to 
7.00; P 
= 
0.003 by the log-rank test) (Fig. S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Another explor-
atory analysis showed a difference in favor of 
adalimumab in the percentage of patients with a 
response at 3 months and at 6 months (P 
= 
0.004 
for the comparison at each time point). A total 
of 34 patients (57%) in the adalimumab group 
and 5 (17%) in the placebo group were classified 
as having had a response (Table S15 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).

Adalimumab plus Methotrexate for JIA-Associated Uveitis
Discussion
In this randomized, placebo-controlled trial in-
volving patients with JIA-associated uveitis, treat-
ment with adalimumab significantly delayed the 
time to treatment failure, as compared with 
methotrexate alone (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% CI, 
0.12 to 0.49; P<0.0001 [the prespecified stopping 
boundary]). A significantly greater proportion of 
patients in the adalimumab group than in the 
placebo group had a reduction in their topical 
glucocorticoid dose (hazard ratio for reduction, 
3.72; 95% CI, 1.09 to 12.71; P 
= 
0.04). A signifi-
cantly greater number of patients in the adalimu-
mab group than in the placebo group discontin-
ued topical glucocorticoids (hazard ratio, 3.58; 
95% CI, 1.24 to 10.32; P 
= 
0.02).
However, there were many more adverse 
events and more severe adverse events in the 
adalimumab group than in the placebo group. 
The most common adverse events in the adalimu-
mab group were minor infections, respiratory 
disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders. The 
rate of adverse events per patient-year was high-
er in the adalimumab group than in the placebo 
group (10.07 vs. 6.51 events per patient-year). 
The number of serious adverse events was also 
higher in the adalimumab group than in the 
placebo group. The follow-up period during the 
course of the trial was not long enough for us to 
detect events such as cancers and demyelinating 
diseases. The sample size precludes commentary 
regarding rarer events.
Limitations of the trial include the use of the 
anterior chamber cell count (SUN criteria) as a 
component of the primary end point. Although 
internationally recognized, the SUN criteria have 
not been validated for use in children. All the 
participating clinicians were instructed in the 
assessment of SUN criteria.
In conclusion, adalimumab in combination 
with methotrexate was an effective therapy in 
children and adolescents with JIA-associated 
uveitis. However, the drug was associated with 
a higher incidence of adverse and serious ad-
verse events than was placebo plus metho-
trexate.

One event in the adalimumab group and two events in the placebo group were a flare of uveitis that resulted in hospitalization and treat-
ment. One event in the placebo group was worsening of vision with a flare of uveitis and macular edema.
