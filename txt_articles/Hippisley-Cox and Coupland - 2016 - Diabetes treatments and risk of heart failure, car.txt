Diabetes treatments and risk of heart failure, cardiovascular 
disease, and all cause mortality: cohort study in primary care
Julia Hippisley-Cox, Carol Coupland
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess associations between risks of cardiovascular 
disease, heart failure, and all cause mortality and 
different diabetes drugs in people with type 2 
diabetes, particularly newer agents, including gliptins 
and thiazolidinediones (glitazones).
Design
Open cohort study.
setting
1243 general practices contributing data to the 
QResearch database in England.
PartiCiPants
469 688 people with type 2 diabetes aged 25-84 years 
between 1 April 2007 and 31 January 2015.
exPOsures
Diabetes drugs (glitazones, gliptins, metformin, 
sulphonylureas, insulin, other) alone and in 
combination.
Main OutCOMe Measure
First recorded diagnoses of cardiovascular disease, 
heart failure, and all cause mortality recorded on the 
patients’ primary care, mortality, or hospital record. 
Cox proportional hazards models were used to 
estimate hazard ratios for diabetes treatments, 
adjusting for potential confounders.
results
During follow-up, 21 308 patients (4.5%) received 
prescriptions for glitazones and 32 533 (6.9%) 
received prescriptions for gliptins. Compared with 
non-use, gliptins were significantly associated with an 
18% decreased risk of all cause mortality, a 14% 
decreased risk of heart failure, and no significant 
change in risk of cardiovascular disease; 
corresponding values for glitazones were significantly 
decreased risks of 23% for all cause mortality, 26% for 
heart failure, and 25% for cardiovascular disease. 
Compared with no current treatment, there were no 
significant associations between monotherapy with 
gliptins and risk of any complications. Dual treatment 
with gliptins and metformin was associated with a 
decreased risk of all three outcomes (reductions of 
38% for heart failure, 33% for cardiovascular disease, 
and 48% for all cause mortality). Triple treatment with 
metformin, sulphonylureas, and gliptins was 
associated with a decreased risk of all three outcomes 
(reductions of 40% for heart failure, 30% for 
cardiovascular disease, and 51% for all cause 
mortality). Compared with no current treatment, 
monotherapy with glitazone was associated with a 
50% decreased risk of heart failure, and dual 
treatment with glitazones and metformin was 
associated with a decreased risk of all three outcomes 
(reductions of 50% for heart failure, 54% for 
cardiovascular disease, and 45% for all cause 
mortality); dual treatment with glitazones and 
sulphonylureas was associated with risk reductions of 
35% for heart failure and 25% for cardiovascular 
disease; triple treatment with metformin, 
sulphonylureas, and glitazones was associated with 
decreased risks of all three outcomes (reductions of 
46% for heart failure, 41% for cardiovascular disease, 
and 56% for all cause mortality).
COnClusiOns
There are clinically important differences in risk of 
cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all cause 
mortality between different diabetes drugs alone and 
in combination. Overall, use of gliptins or glitazones 
was associated with decreased risks of heart failure, 
cardiovascular disease, and all cause mortality 
compared with non-use of these drugs. These results, 
which do not account for levels of adherence or 
dosage information and which are subject to 
confounding by indication, might have implications for 
prescribing of diabetes drugs.
Introduction
Cardiovascular disease and heart failure are major 
causes of morbidity and mortality in people with type 2 
diabetes.1 
2  Once heart failure is present in people with 
diabetes, mortality is increased 10-fold and five year 
survival is only 12.5%, a prognosis worse than for meta-
static breast cancer.2  Several diabetes drugs have been 
associated with an unexpected increase in risk of heart 
failure during both clinical trials3  and post-marketing

surveillance raising concerns about the overall risks 
and benefits for people with diabetes.4 
5
Following its launch in 2000,6  rosiglitazone, the first 
drug in the “insulin sensitising” thiazolidinedione 
class, was associated with an increased rate of heart 
failure.5  This resulted in its withdrawal from Europe, 
India, New Zealand, and South Africa in 2010-11. Rosigl-
itazone is, however, still prescribed in the United 
States—a controversial decision7  informed by the open 
label “non-inferiority” rosiglitazone evaluated for car-
diovascular outcomes in oral agent combination ther-
apy for type 2 diabetes (RECORD) trial funded by the 
manufacturers of rosiglitazone (Avandia; GlaxoSmith-
Kline).4  The RECORD study assessed cardiovascular 
outcomes in 2220 people prescribed rosiglitazone in 
combination with either metformin or sulphonylureas 
compared with 2227 prescribed both metformin and sul-
phonylureas between 2001 and 2008. Although the 
numbers of events were low, the trial reported an 
increased risk of heart failure with rosiglitazone and 
was unable to rule out an increased risk of myocardial 
infarction.4  The design, results, and interpretation of 
this trial have been heavily criticised.8
Pioglitazone is another thiazolidinedione that 
decreases blood glucose levels. The placebo controlled 
PROactive trial of pioglitazone9  was also controversial 
in its design and interpretation, largely because of the 
choice of composite endpoints.10  Although the trial 
failed to clearly show improved cardiovascular out-
comes for patients, it reported increased hospital 
admissions for heart failure as an adverse effect,9  as did 
a subsequent meta-analysis of 8554 patients prescribed 
pioglitazone.11  Meanwhile, a Canadian cohort study 
comparing pioglitazone with rosiglitazone between 
2002 and 2008 reported a lower risk of heart failure and 
death in pioglitazone users.12  Similarly, a US cohort 
study reported a lower risk of stroke, heart failure, and 
all cause mortality among patients prescribed pioglita-
zone compared with rosiglitazone.13  Pioglitazone con-
tinues to be prescribed in the United Kingdom and the 
US although it has been withdrawn elsewhere owing to 
concerns about an increased risk of bladder cancer.14
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, also 
known as gliptins, are a relatively new class of diabetes 
drug that are included in international guidelines15  as 
second line agents after metformin, although data on 
long term clinical benefits and safety are inconclusive.16 
 
In a placebo controlled clinical trial, saxagliptin was 
associated with an unexpected 27% increase in admis-
sions to hospital from heart failure.3  In the Examination 
of Cardiovascular Outcomes with Alogliptin versus 
Standard of Care (EXAMINE) trial,17  alogliptin did not 
significantly increase overall risk of hospital admis-
sions for heart failure compared with placebo. Simi-
larly, in the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes 
with Sitagliptin (TECOS) trial, sitagliptin was not asso-
ciated with an increased risk of heart failure compared 
with placebo.18  Observational studies have also found 
inconsistent associations. Sitagliptin was associated 
with an increased risk of heart failure in a cohort study 
of 8288 Taiwanese patients using sitagliptin over 1.5 
years.19  Conversely, a US cohort study of 8032 sita-
gliptin users showed no excess risk of hospital admis-
sion or death compared with users of other glucose 
lowering agents.20  Although heart failure was included 
within the composite endpoint, it was not evaluated 
separately. A meta-analysis of 25 trials of 7726 patients 
receiving sitagliptin or a comparator agent between 12 
weeks and two years was undertaken by the manufac-
turers of sitagliptin (Januvia; MSD).21 The composite 
study endpoints included major adverse cardiovascular 
events (defined as ischaemic events or cardiovascular 
deaths), but the study did not specifically evaluate risk 
of heart failure. In summary, the findings from clinical 
trials and observational studies are inconsistent, which 
may reflect differences in study design, study duration, 
individual drugs, or outcome measures.
Uncertainty remains over the longer term compara-
tive risks among patients prescribed different diabetes 
drugs, particularly gliptins and glitazones alone and in 
combination with other diabetes drugs.22 
23  Regulatory 
agencies have responded to this uncertainty by 
 
requiring evidence that new diabetes drugs are not 
associated with harmful increases in cardiovascular 
events rather than the more stringent requirement that 
the drugs result in evidence of clinical benefit.24 
25
Concerns have also been raised about the safety of 
sulphonylureas, an older class of oral diabetes drug, as 
these have been linked with increased adverse cardio-
vascular events in some5  but not all studies.26  The life-
long nature of diabetes, the noticeable increase in its 
incidence and prevalence, and prescribing recommen-
dations in guidelines,15  mean that the number of people 
prescribed diabetes drugs is likely to increase. Given the 
impracticability and ethical difficulties of head-to-head 
trials comparing different agents, the risks of clinical 
outcomes need to be quantified in large representative 
populations of people prescribed these drugs over lon-
ger periods. This information, which is available from 
large longitudinal observational databases, can comple-
ment information from meta-analyses of clinical trials 
that, while valuable, are prone to publication bias and 
lack sufficient detail, duration of follow-up, or the power 
to make relevant comparisons for unintended effects.21 
23
We therefore carried out a cohort study using a large 
UK primary care database with linked general practi-
tioner, mortality, and hospital admissions data to inves-
tigate the associations between different classes of 
diabetes drugs and the risks of heart failure, cardiovas-
cular disease, and all cause mortality for people with 
type 2 diabetes. We were particularly interested in the 
risks associated with the newer agents, including glita-
zones and gliptins. In a companion paper we reported 
on a similar analysis examining the risks of microvascu-
lar complications (severe kidney disease, blindness, 
lower limb amputation), hyperglycaemia, and hypogly-
caemia between different classes of diabetes drugs in 
people with type 2 diabetes.27

diabetes. We used a large population of primary care 
patients derived from version 40 of the QResearch data-
base (www.qresearch.org). QResearch is a continually 
updated patient level pseudonymised database with 
event level data extending back to 1989. QResearch cur-
rently includes clinical and demographic data from 
over 1243 general practices in England and two prac-
tices in Scotland, covering a population of over 24 mil-
lion patients, and collected in the course of routine 
healthcare by general practitioners and associated 
staff. The primary care data include demographic infor-
mation, diagnoses, prescriptions, referrals, laboratory 
test results, and clinical values. Diagnoses are recorded 
using the Read code classification.28  QResearch has 
been used for a wide range of clinical research, includ-
ing the assessment of unintended effects of commonly 
prescribed medicines.29-34 The primary care data are 
linked at individual patient level to hospital episode 
statistics and mortality records from the Office for 
National Statistics. Hospital episode statistics provides 
details of all National Health Service inpatient admis-
sions since 1997, including primary and secondary 
causes coded using the ICD-10 (international classifica-
tion of diseases, 10th revision) classifications and 
OPCS-4 (Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, 
fourth revision) codes for operations and interventions. 
ONS provides details of all deaths in England with pri-
mary and underlying causes, also coded using the ICD-
10 classification. Patient records are linked using a 
project specific pseudonymised NHS number, which is 
valid and complete for 99.8% of primary care patients, 
99.9% of ONS mortality records, and 98% of hospital 
admissions records.1
inclusion and exclusion criteria
The study included all QResearch practices in England 
that had been using the Egton Medical Information Sys-
tems (EMIS) computer system for at least a year. We ini-
tially identified an open cohort of people aged 25-84 
years registered with eligible practices between 1 April 
2007 and 31 January 2015. This time interval was chosen 
because both pioglitazone and gliptins were available 
in the UK during the full study period. We then selected 
people with diabetes if they had a Read code for diabe-
tes or more than one prescription for a diabetes drug.
We excluded people as having type 1 diabetes if they 
had received a diagnosis aged less than 35 and had been 
prescribed insulin.35  We also excluded patients without 
a postcode related deprivation score. For each patient 
we determined an entry date to the cohort, which was 
the latest of the following: date of diagnosis of diabetes, 
25th birthday, date of registration with the practice plus 
one year, date on which the practice computer system 
was installed plus one year, and the beginning of the 
study period. To reduce bias we used an incident user 
design for people prescribed glitazones, gliptins (our 
main drugs of interest), or insulin.36  As in other stud-
ies,20 we defined incident users as people without a pre-
scription for these drugs in the 12 months before the 
study entry date, and we excluded people who had 
received any of these drugs in the previous 12 months. 
We included prevalent users of metformin or sulphony-
lureas in the study cohort; if we had excluded them the 
numbers of new users of glitazones and gliptins—our 
main exposures of interest—would have been substan-
tially reduced because these drugs are usually pre-
scribed after monotherapy with metformin or 
sulphonylureas. People with an existing diagnosis of an 
outcome of interest at the study entry date were also 
excluded from the analysis of that outcome. Patients 
were censored at the earliest date of the first recorded 
diagnosis of the outcome of interest, death, deregistra-
tion with the practice, last upload of computerised 
data, or the end date of the study (31 January 2015).
Outcomes
Our primary outcomes were incident heart failure, car-
diovascular disease, and all cause mortality, recorded 
in either the patient’s primary care record, linked hos-
pital record, or mortality record.
Definition of outcomes
We used Read codes to identify recorded diagnoses of 
heart failure from the primary care records (G58%, 
G5yy9, G5yyA, 662f, 662g, 662h, and 662i). To identify 
incident cases of heart failure from hospital and mortal-
ity records, we used ICD-10 clinical codes (I110, I130, 
I42, and I50). We used the earliest recorded date of 
heart failure on any of the three data sources as the 
index date for the diagnosis of heart failure.
Our definition of cardiovascular disease included 
coronary heart disease (angina and myocardial infarc-
tion), stroke, or transient ischaemic attacks but not 
peripheral vascular disease. The supplementary file 
lists the Read codes used for case identification on the 
primary care record. The ICD-10 codes used for case 
identification on the ONS death certificate or hospital 
admission records were: angina pectoris (I20), acute 
myocardial infarction (I22), complications after acute 
myocardial infarction (I23), other acute ischaemic heart 
disease (I24), chronic ischaemic heart disease (I25), and 
ischaemic stroke (I63, I64) or transient ischaemic attack 
(G45). We used the earliest recorded date of cardiovas-
cular disease on any of the three data sources as the 
index date for the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease.
All cause mortality was defined by the status of death 
recorded in the general practice systems linked to the 
date and cause of death as recorded on the ONS mortal-
ity record.
exposure data
Our primary exposures of interest were new use of 
gliptins and new use of glitazones during the study 
period. For each participant we extracted details of all 
individual prescriptions for all types of diabetes drug, 
including the prescription date and the type of drug. We 
partitioned the follow-up time into treatment periods, 
where each period corresponded to treatment with a 
particular type or combination of diabetes drug, or 
could be a period of no treatment with any diabetes 
drugs. If the patient changed to a different type of treat-
ment or to a different combination of treatments, we

classified that as a separate treatment period. For exam-
ple, if a patient was prescribed metformin alone on 
entry to the cohort for 12 months and then was pre-
scribed both glitazones and metformin for a further 24 
months and then had a treatment free period for six 
months until they were censored, they would have 
three treatment periods (metformin only for 12 months, 
metformin and glitazones for 24 months, and no treat-
ment for six months).
We determined the duration of each treatment period 
by calculating the number of days between the earliest 
issue date and the latest issue date plus 90 days for the 
type of treatment prescribed. If another treatment was 
added before the initial treatment was stopped then we 
calculated the duration of the treatment period on the 
initial treatment alone to be the number of days 
between the earliest issue date for the initial treatment 
and the earliest issue date for the next treatment. We 
added 90 days to the last prescription date as an esti-
mate of the date on which the patient stopped  
treatment 
(the “stop date”), we made this assumption to allow for 
events that occur during a withdrawal period to be 
attributed to the drug rather than being counted as 
unexposed time. For the analysis, we used six binary 
exposure variables for each treatment period to indicate 
treatment with any of the diabetes drugs, grouped into 
six drug classes—glitazones (including rosiglitazone 
and pioglitazone), gliptins, metformin, sulphonylureas, 
insulin, and other oral diabetes drugs (including α-glu-
cosidase inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
inhibitors, glinides, guar). This accounted for patients 
receiving different combinations of these drugs during 
a treatment period. To further assess associations for 
different specific treatment combinations (such as dual 
treatment with metformin and glitazones) we also cate-
gorised treatments during each treatment period into 
one categorical variable with 21 mutually exclusive 
treatment categories, including a no current treatment 
group and 20 categories for monotherapy, dual treat-
ment, and triple combinations of drugs.
Confounding variables
We considered confounding variables that were likely 
to be associated with the risk of the complications from 
diabetes20-40 or with the likelihood of receiving treat-
ment with different diabetes drugs. These included age 
at study entry, sex, number of years since diabetes was 
diagnosed (<1 year and 1-3, 4-6, 7-10, and ≥ 11 years),40 
 
calendar year, smoking status (non-smoker; former 
smoker; light smoker, 1-9 cigarettes/day; moderate 
smoker, 10-19 cigarettes/day; heavy smoker, ≥20 ciga-
rettes/day; not recorded), ethnic group (white/not 
recorded, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, other Asian, 
black African, black Caribbean, Chinese, other, includ-
ing mixed),37  Townsend deprivation score, previous 
diabetes complications (severe kidney failure,40  ≥1 epi-
sodes of hyperglycaemia, ≥1 episodes of hypoglycae-
mia, lower limb amputation, blindness), comorbidities 
(cardiovascular disease40  (other than when cardiovas-
cular disease was the outcome of interest), heart failure 
(other than when heart failure was the outcome of 
 
interest), peripheral vascular disease, valvular heart 
disease, chronic kidney disease, atrial fibrillation,37 
 
hypertension,37  rheumatoid arthritis37 )), prescription 
drugs (statins, aspirin, anticoagulants, thiazides, 
angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin 
receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers), and clin-
ical values (body mass index kg/m,2 40  cholesterol to 
high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio,37  systolic 
blood pressure (mm Hg),37 serum creatinine level, gly-
cated haemoglobin A1c (mmol/mol).40 41 We evaluated 
confounders at the start of each treatment period for 
comorbidities, previous complications, other pre-
scribed drugs, smoking status, and clinical values. For 
comorbidities and previous complications, we identi-
fied whether patients had a diagnosis recorded before 
the relevant treatment period. For prescribed drugs, we 
defined patients as treated at the start of the relevant 
period of diabetes drug treatment if they had at least 
two prescriptions for the other type of drug, including 
one in the 28 days before the treatment period and one 
after the start date. For smoking status and continuous 
variables (systolic blood pressure, body mass index, 
creatinine level, cholesterol to high density lipoprotein 
cholesterol ratio, and haemoglobin A1c), we used the 
most recent recorded value immediately before the rel-
evant treatment period.
statistical analysis
Using Cox proportional hazards models we assessed 
the associations between the six different classes of 
diabetes drugs and risk of each of our three outcomes, 
adjusting for potential confounding variables. Rather 
than using a competing risks analysis we used the Cox 
model as it is considered more appropriate for analyses 
of causes such as in this study, whereas competing 
risks analyses tend to be more useful for prediction 
modelling or estimating absolute risks.42-44 To account 
for patients starting and stopping different diabetes 
treatments and changing between treatments, we 
included use of different diabetes drugs as time varying 
exposures. In the analysis, we calculated unadjusted 
and adjusted hazard ratios for the six different classes 
of diabetes drug (each as a binary variable indicating 
use or no use), with adjustment for the confounding 
variables and the other classes of diabetes drugs. We 
also calculated unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios 
for the mutually exclusive treatment combinations 
comparing each treatment category with no current 
treatment. To determine whether there were significant 
differences between classes or individual drugs, we 
carried out Wald’s tests. We tested for interactions 
between the six different drug classes and age, sex, 
haemoglobin A1c, and body mass index. We used mul-
tiple imputation with chained equations to replace 
missing values for continuous values and smoking sta-
tus and used these values in our main analyses.45-47 We 
did this for each of the study outcomes and in the 
imputation model included the censoring indicator for 
the outcome, the log of survival time, all the confound-
ing variables, and the diabetes drug treatment vari-
ables. Before  
imputation we log transformed body

mass index,  
haemoglobin A1c, creatinine level, and 
cholesterol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol 
ratio, as they had skewed distributions. We carried out 
five imputations, and combined the results using 
Rubin’s rules.
To evaluate the robustness of our results and assess 
the impact of confounding variables we added the con-
founding variables to our model in blocks and com-
pared the adjusted hazard ratios. Box 1 lists the models 
we assessed.
We also carried out a sensitivity analysis where we 
excluded prevalent users of sulphonylureas from the 
study cohort so that the hazard ratios for sulphony-
lureas are based on incident users, and we fitted the 
models F and G (see box 1).
We used all the available data in the database to 
 
maximise the power and generalisability of the results. 
P values less than 0.01 (two tailed) were considered as 
significant and hazard ratios of 1.10 or more or 0.90 or 
less as clinically important. STATA (version 13.1) was 
used for all analyses.
Patient involvement
Patients were not involved in setting the research ques-
tion, in the outcome measures, in the design, or in the 
implementation of the study. Patient representatives 
from the QResearch advisory board have written the 
information for patients on the QResearch website 
about the use of the database for research. They have 
also advised on dissemination, including the use of lay 
summaries describing the research and its results.
Results
Overall, 1243 practices contributing to QResearch in 
England met the inclusion criteria. A cohort of 601 405 
patients aged 25-84 years with diabetes was identified 
(fig 1 ). We sequentially excluded 31 224 people with type 
1 diabetes (5.1%), 748 (0.1%) without a Townsend depri-
vation score, and 99 745 prescribed glitazones, gliptins, 
or insulin in the 12 months before the study entry date, 
leaving 469 688 patients with type 2 diabetes in the 
study cohort. Figure 1 also shows the numbers of 
patients with each outcome at baseline who were 
excluded from the analysis of that outcome, as well as 
the numbers of incident outcomes observed during fol-
low-up.
baseline characteristics
In total 274 324 (58.4%) of the patients in the study 
cohort received prescriptions for one or more diabetes 
drugs during follow-up: 21 308 (4.5%) for glitazones, 
32 533 (6.9%) for gliptins, 256 024 (54.5%) for metformin, 
134 570 (28.7%) for sulphonylureas, 19 791 (4.2%) for 
insulin, and 12 062 (2.6%) for other oral diabetes drugs.
Table 1 shows the characteristics of patients who 
started each of the six classes of diabetes drugs during 
follow-up based on the last recorded value before the 
drug was first prescribed (or at study entry for patients 
already prescribed sulphonylureas, metformin, or other 
diabetes drugs at baseline). The groups were similar for 
most characteristics except for higher levels of comor-
bidities other than hypertension in patients prescribed 
insulin, and lower levels of prescriptions for statins and 
aspirin in patients prescribed metformin compared 
with the other drugs.
Table 2 shows levels of recording and mean values for 
haemoglobin A1c, body mass index, cholesterol to high 
density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, systolic blood 
pressure, and serum creatinine level before starting 
treatment. The highest levels of recording were for hae-
moglobin A1c, which were in excess of 97% for all six 
drug groups. Lowest levels of recording were for choles-
terol to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios, 
which were more than 84% for all drug groups. Overall, 
at least 82% of patients had complete data for each clin-
ical value across all drug groups. Apart from higher 
mean levels of haemoglobin A1c in patients before use 
of insulin or the group of other diabetes drugs, and 
higher levels of creatinine among those prescribed sul-

group
Table 3  shows the number of incident cases of each out-
come for patients’ periods of use of each of the six treat-
ment groups during follow-up. Importantly, the 
treatment groups in table 3  are not mutually exclu-
sive—for example, the rows for glitazones include any 
use of glitazones, whether as monotherapy, dual treat-
ment, or triple treatment. Similarly, the adjusted hazard 
ratios for model C shown in table 3 give an overall risk 
for the use of each drug group compared with non-use 
of that drug group, having adjusted for use of other dia-
betes drugs and the potential confounders listed in the 
footnote.
For our main exposures of interest we found that 
compared with non-use, glitazones were significantly 
associated with a 23% decreased risk of all cause

mortality, a 26% decreased risk of heart failure, and a 
25% decreased risk of cardiovascular disease; and com-
pared with non-use, gliptins were significantly associ-
ated with an 18% decreased risk of all cause mortality, a 
14% decreased risk of heart failure, and no significant 
association with risk of cardiovascular disease.
In addition, for the other diabetes drug groups we 
found that compared with non-use, metformin was 
associated with a significantly decreased risk of all 
three outcomes—41% decreased risk of all cause mortal-
ity, a 30% decreased risk of heart failure, and a 24% 
decreased risk of cardiovascular disease; compared 
with non-use, sulphonylureas were significantly associ-
ated with a 10% increased risk of all cause mortality; 
compared with non-use, insulin was associated with a 
47% increased risk of all cause mortality, a 32% 
increased risk of heart failure, and a 23% increased risk 
of cardiovascular disease; and compared with non-use, 
the other diabetes drugs group was significantly associ-
ated with an 18% decreased risk of all cause mortality.
For all cause mortality, we found significant interac-
tions between glitazones and both age and haemoglo-
bin A1c (see supplementary tables 2a and b; model D) 
where the reduced risk of all cause mortality associated 
with glitazone use became less marked with both 
increasing age and increasing levels of haemoglobin 
A1c. Similarly, for cardiovascular disease, there were 
significant interactions between glitazones and haemo-
globin A1c, where the reduced risk of cardiovascular 
disease associated with glitazone use became less 
marked with increasing levels of haemoglobin A1c.
We found similar interactions in both magnitude and 
direction for gliptins and both age and haemoglobin A1c 
for all cause mortality and between gliptins and haemo-
globin A1c for cardiovascular disease.
Supplementary table 2 also shows the results from 
analyses with confounders added in separate blocks 
(models A and B). Generally, including comorbidities 
and previous complications in the model (model B) 
tended to result in similar hazard ratios for gliptins and 
glitazones (compared with model A). Further inclusion 
of clinical values (table 3: model C) only resulted in 
small changes to the hazard ratios. The sensitivity anal-
ysis excluding prevalent users of sulphonylureas at 
study entry showed increases in adjusted hazard ratios 
for all cause mortality and cardiovascular disease for 
insulin (see supplementary table 2: model E compared 
with model C) but similar hazard ratios for the other 
diabetes drug groups for all three outcomes.

risks associated with different treatment 
combinations
Table 4 provides a more detailed breakdown of 21 mutu-
ally exclusive treatment categories, including a no cur-
rent treatment group, which included 0.7 million 
person years free of use of any diabetes drug. The table 
shows the number of events for each clinical outcome 
for each of the treatment categories.
Table 5 shows the corresponding adjusted hazard 
ratios for each treatment group category compared 
with no current treatment. The key significant findings 
are (all compared with periods of no diabetes drug 
treatment):
• There were no significant associations between 
monotherapy with gliptins and risk of any of the three 
outcomes. Dual treatment with gliptins and metformin 
was associated with a decreased risk of all three out-
comes (reductions of 38% for heart failure, 33% for car-
diovascular disease, and 48% for all cause mortality). 
Triple treatment with metformin, sulphonylureas, and 
gliptins was associated with a decreased risk of all 
three outcomes (reductions of 40% for heart failure, 
30% for cardiovascular disease, and 51% for all cause 
mortality).
• Monotherapy with glitazones was associated with a 
50% decreased risk of heart failure. Dual treatment with 
metformin and glitazones was associated with a 
decreased risk of all three outcomes (reductions of 50% 
for heart failure, 54% for cardiovascular disease, and 
45% for all cause mortality). Dual treatment with sul-
phonylureas and glitazones was associated with a 
decreased risk of two outcomes (reductions of 35% for 
heart failure and 25% for cardiovascular  
disease). Triple 
treatment with metformin, sulphonylureas, and glita-
zones was associated with a decreased risk of all three 
outcomes (reductions of 46% for heart failure, 41% for 
cardiovascular disease, and 56% for all cause mortal-
ity).
Table 6 shows the results for the different treatment 
combinations compared with metformin treatment 
alone (rather than compared with periods of no treat-
ment as previously). The key findings for our two expo-

and glitazones was associated with a decreased risk of 
all three outcomes (reductions of 21% for heart failure, 
22% for cardiovascular disease, and 32% for all cause 
mortality) compared with metformin alone.
Supplementary table 3 shows the results for the dif-
ferent treatment combinations compared with periods 
of no treatment, having dropped prevalent users of sul-
phonylureas at study entry (model G). Incident use of 
sulphonlyureas, whether alone or in combination with 
insulin as dual or triple treatment, was associated with 
a substantial increased risk of all cause mortality of 
50%, 171%, and 87%, respectively. Monotherapy with 
sulphonylureas was associated with a 12% increased 
risk of cardiovascular disease and a 16% increased risk 
of heart failure. Triple treatment with sulphonlyureas, 
metformin, and insulin was associated with a 42% 
increased risk of heart failure. Overall, the adjusted 
hazard ratios for glitazones and gliptins were similar to 
those in table 5, except confidence intervals were wider, 
and there was no longer a significant decrease in risk of 
heart failure and cardiovascular disease among people 
prescribed dual treatment with sulphonylureas and 
 
glitazones.
discussion
We have conducted a large cohort study of risks for 
 
cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all cause 
 
mortality associated with different diabetes drugs in 
people with type 2 diabetes attending for routine clini-
cal care in the UK. Our companion paper27  presented 
the corresponding analysis for other complications of 
diabetes, including blindness, amputation, severe kid-
ney failure, hyperglycaemia, and hypoglycaemia. The 
approach we have taken allows assessment of the rela-
tive benefits and hazards of diabetes drugs in a real 
world clinical setting for a range of clinically important 
outcomes. It enables analysis of treatment periods that 
are substantially longer than those reported in clinical 
trials,9  including more events than in previous similar 
observational studies.5 
12
We have found clinically relevant differences 
between different diabetes drugs (alone and in combi-
nation) in the risk of three key outcomes—heart failure, 
cardiovascular disease, and death—in people with type 
2 diabetes. Compared with non-use, use of glitazones 
was significantly associated with a decreased risk of all 
three outcomes (all cause mortality; heart failure, and 
cardiovascular disease), whereas use of gliptins was 
significantly associated with a decreased risk of two 
outcomes (all cause mortality and heart failure) but no 
significant change in risk of cardiovascular disease. 
Compared with periods of no treatment, dual treatment 
(ie, metformin and gliptins or metformin and glita-
zones) was associated with a decreased risk of all three 
outcomes, as was triple treatment with metformin, sul-
phonylureas, and either gliptins or glitazones.

However, since the use of gliptins and glitazones is 
usually recommended as a second line treatment in 
combination with other agents such as metformin, the 
clinical question is whether the addition of gliptins or 
glitazones to metformin monotherapy is associated 
with net benefit or net harm. Compared with metformin 
monotherapy, dual treatment (metformin and glita-
zones) and triple treatment (metformin, sulphony-
lureas, and glitazones) were associated with decreased 
risk of all three outcomes (see table 6 ). Dual treatment 
(metformin and gliptins) was associated with a 
decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and all cause 
mortality compared with metformin monotherapy. 
 
Triple treatment (metformin, sulphonylureas, and 
gliptins) was associated with a 24% reduced risk of all 
cause mortality (see table 6).
gliptins
Our study included over 70 000 person years of exposure 
to gliptins from over 32 500 patients, which represents 
one of the largest studies to date, with over four times 
more gliptin users than in the observational study by 
Eurich et al.20  Our results differ from those reported by 
Eurich et al, since we found that use of gliptins com-
pared with non-use was associated with a reduction in 
all cause mortality. We also found that dual treatment 
(metformin and gliptins) and triple treatment 
 
(metformin, sulphonylureas, and gliptins) seems to be 
associated with a lower risk of all cause mortality com-
pared with monotherapy with metformin. The median 
duration of use of gliptins in our study was 5.7 years, 
compared with 2.5 years in the study by Eurich et al,20 
 
and the mean age of our cohort was 63 years compared 
with 52 years.20  We also had more events and more sta-
tistical power—there were 996 deaths during 71 524 per-
son years of exposure to gliptins in our study compared 
with 32 deaths during 11 307 person years in the study by 
Eurich et al.20  Our findings of a reduction in risk of all 
cause mortality are relatively novel and deserve further 
investigation, especially as there was no overall reduc-
tion in cardiovascular events. Our results are consistent 
with another recent real world observational study, 
which found gliptins associated with reduced all cause 
mortality.48  Park et al hypothesised that their findings 
might reflect reduced hypoglycaemic events, although 
their study, like ours, was observational and susceptible 
to unmeasured confounding.48  In our companion paper, 
we reported reduced risks of hypoglycaemia among 
gliptin users compared with non-users, which is broadly 
consistent with this hypothesis.27
Our results are also broadly consistent with recent 
non-inferiority trials18  and meta-analyses of ran-
domised controlled trials, reporting that various 
gliptins (alogliptin, dutogliptin, linagliptin, saxagliptin,

sitagliptin, and vildagliptin) are associated with statis-
tically significant 30-60% reductions in major adverse 
cardiac events and non-significant 33% and 48% reduc-
tions in all cause and cardiovascular death compared 
with other active drugs or placebo treatment.49 
50  How-
ever, Monami et al urge caution in interpreting the 
results because the events were not the principle end-
points, the trial duration was short, and the character-
istics of patients could be different from those of 
patients in routine clinical practice.50  We found an 
inverse association for gliptins, with a 15% lower risk of 
heart failure, whereas trials did not find such a strong 
benefit. This may reflect residual confounding owing to 
the observational study design or differences in study 
duration. However, our findings are consistent with the 
recently published multicentre nested case-control 
study,51  which also reported a 14-18% lower risk of hos-
pital admission for heart failure with gliptins compared 
with other diabetes drugs. It is also consistent with a 
new user cohort study, which did not find a higher risk 
of heart failure among patients prescribed gliptins com-
pared with other diabetes drugs.52
Some of the differences in results between our obser-
vational study and earlier clinical trials may reflect the 
type of gliptin studied—80% of patients prescribed 
gliptins were prescribed sitagliptin in our study com-
pared with saxagliptin in some of the trials. Currently 
there are too few patients prescribed linagliptin, 
saxagliptin, and vildagliptin to support separate analy-
ses by individual drug, which is a limitation of the study 
as there may be differences between individual gliptins 
and their effect on haemoglobin A1c.53 However, the 
numbers of people taking different types of gliptin is 
likely to increase over time, and further analyses can be 
undertaken once more data have accrued.
glitazones
Our study included over 55 000 person years of expo-
sure to glitazones arising from 21 308 patients. The pre-
dominant glitazone was pioglitazone, which was 
prescribed to 90% of glitazone users, and hence our 
results most closely reflect associations for pioglitazone 
rather than rosiglitazone (withdrawn in the UK in 2010). 
Our study is substantially larger than a previous UK 
study of 92 000 people with diabetes, which finished in 
20054  and includes newer drugs available over the past 
decade. It supplements information from the Canadian 
study,12  of people aged 66 and over which compared 
three outcomes (heart failure, myocardial infarction, 
and death) among 16 951 users of pioglitazone com-
pared with 22 785 users of rosiglitazone between 2002 
and 2008. Our study is more recent and includes more 
patients prescribed pioglitazone over a longer duration 
(mean exposure of 4.5 years in our study compared with 
294 days). It also includes more events—the Canadian 
study12 included 461 cases of heart failure, 273 of myo-
cardial infarction, and 377 deaths.
We have found significant reductions in two out-
comes—cardiovascular disease and all cause mortal-
ity—among users of glitazones compared with non-users 
(table 3 ). This reduction is similar in magnitude to that 
reported in clinical trials and meta-analyses of pioglita-
zone.9 
11  In 2007
, Lincoff et al reported a meta-analysis 
of 19 trials of pioglitazone with a treatment duration 
ranging from four months to 3.5 years.11  The results 
showed an 18% decreased risk of their composite pri-
mary outcome (risk of death, myocardial infarction, or 
stroke). However, we have reported a decreased risk of 
heart failure among users of glitazones compared with 
non-users. This contrasts with the increase in heart fail-
ure that occurred in other studies, without an associ-
ated increase in mortality.9 11  The authors of the 
PROactive study partially attributed this finding to a 
diagnostic bias due to the increase of oedema in the 
pioglitazone group.9  Our observational study differs 
from the clinical trial not only in design, size, and set-
ting but also in the calendar time during which it was 
conducted and in the selection of patients. For exam-
ple, the PROactive study9  selectively recruited high risk 
patients with pre-existing macrovascular disease, 
whereas our study included a more representative pop-
ulation from primary care. Two thirds of patients in the 
PROactive study9 had evidence of myocardial infarction 
or stroke compared with 14% in our study. It is also pos-
sible that, given the growing concerns about rosiglita-
zone and its subsequent withdrawal, patients with 
symptoms or signs suggestive of early heart failure 
(such as breathlessness or oedema) in our study might 
not have been prescribed pioglitazone or might have 
switched to another diabetes drug.
Other diabetes drugs
Although our research question focuses on associations 
between gliptins and glitazones and adverse clinical 
outcomes, for comparison we have results for other 
 
diabetes drugs. Overall, metformin monotherapy was 
associated with reduced risks of all cause mortality, 
heart failure, and cardiovascular disease compared 
with non-use. This is important because metformin is 
generally recommended as the first line diabetes drug 
and is commonly used in combinations with other 
drugs. Sulphonylureas were associated with an 
increased risk of all cause mortality both in the main 
analysis and in the sensitivity analyses restricted to new 
users of sulphonylureas. Monotherapy with sulphony-
lureas was also associated with an increased risk of car-
diovascular disease and as triple treatment with 
metformin and insulin was associated with an 
increased risk of heart failure compared with metformin 
alone. These unfavourable results are consistent with 
some studies linking sulphonylureas with increased 
adverse cardiovascular events,5  but not all studies.26 
 
Further research into the safety of sulphonylureas com-
pared with other types of diabetes drugs is warranted. 
However, this research needs to distinguish between 
individual types of sulphonylureas, as different individ-
ual drugs have different mortality risks.54
As in our companion paper,27  we excluded prevalent 
users of insulin at baseline but included in the analysis 
those patients subsequently prescribed insulin because 
insulin is part of the treatment ladder and some of these 
people will also have had other drugs of interest during

follow-up. Although insulin was not the primary drug of 
interest, patients prescribed insulin had higher risks of 
all three outcomes, despite adjustment for higher levels 
of comorbidity. It is unlikely that this increased risk was 
a direct result of treatment with insulin. Instead, resid-
ual confounding and reverse causality could have 
occurred—that is, the insulin treated group was at 
much higher risk of complications than the groups 
treated with diet or oral drugs, and these result in their 
apparently worse outcomes and not their treatment 
with insulin. For example, in table 2, the insulin treated 
group had the highest haemoglobin A1c and creatinine 
values before treatment, although both factors were 
adjusted for in the analyses. An alternative explanation 
could be that patients with symptoms that indicated 
cardiovascular disease or heart failure were prescribed 
insulin rather than glitazones or gliptins before subse-
quently having a diagnosis of these conditions.
strengths and limitations of this study
Generalisability
This is a large study based on an ethnically diverse con-
temporaneous, representative population of people 
with type 2 diabetes during an eight year study period. 
We included all eligible patients to minimise selection 
bias. Hence we think the results are likely to be general-
isable to similar populations of people with type 2 dia-
betes. Although our observational study has limitations 
inherent in its design, it also has advantages over 
meta-analyses of clinical trials as these tend to be lim-
ited by ascertainment and reporting of events, short 
follow-up, lack of time to event data, and insufficient 
power to report on rare cardiovascular events.23
Clinical outcomes
Strengths of our analysis are the inclusion of hard clin-
ical endpoints of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, 
and death based on clinical diagnoses recorded on at 
least one of three linked electronic data sources. Use of 
all three linked data sources was designed to minimise 
under-ascertainment of outcomes, which would other-
wise lead to under-estimation of absolute risks. The car-
diovascular disease and heart failure outcomes are 
based on clinical diagnoses made by the treating clini-
cian rather than formally adjudicated events as would 
occur in a clinical trial. Although it is possible that some 
patients were recorded as having heart failure or cardio-
vascular disease who did not have this condition, such 
misclassification will not have affected the mortality 
outcome. UK general practices have good levels of accu-
racy and completeness in recording clinical diagnoses 
and prescribed drugs.55  Also, the diagnostic validity of 
such diagnoses in general practice has been shown to 
be high.56 Possible ascertainment bias of outcomes is 
unlikely to vary according to the type of diabetes drug 
prescribed so would not explain the associations we 
found.
Exposure to diabetes drugs
We had detailed information on use of diabetes drugs 
prescribed throughout the follow-up period, enabling 
us to develop a detailed categorisation of drug exposure 
time into 21 different treatment groups, including com-
binations of treatments. Recording of prescriptions 
issued in UK general practices has high levels of com-
pleteness.57  We ascertained patient characteristics, 
concurrent drugs, clinical values, and diagnoses at the 
beginning of each treatment period. This enabled us to 
account for switching between different treatments or 
treatment combinations, making adjustments for a 
large number of potential confounders. We undertook a 
time varying analysis, which analysed different types of 
monotherapy, dual treatment, and triple treatment over 
the study period. This reflects real world prescribing 
patterns over a long duration, allowing multiple com-
parisons not only between drugs but also between dif-
ferent combinations of drugs compared with untreated 
periods of time (diet only treatment). Our study anal-
ysed prescribed drugs rather than the drug actually 
taken by the patients, although renewal of prescrip-
tions is likely to indicate drug use, as patients need to 
initiate repeat prescriptions. This could result in mis-
classification of exposure if patients were prescribed 
drugs that they did not actually take and could underes-
timate associations between use of diabetes drugs and 
clinical outcomes. Unlike previous studies, we have 
included comparisons of risk against periods of no 
treatment,5 which is important as about 40% of people 
with type 2 diabetes are managed without diabetes 
drugs throughout follow-up. Limitations include lack of 
analyses for different subtypes of each type of drug and 
for different dose levels.
Assessment of other types of bias
Other types of bias that can affect observational studies 
include recall bias, indication bias, and channelling 
bias. Recall bias will not have occurred as data on pre-
scriptions for diabetes drugs and confounding variables 
were recorded before the clinical outcomes. We 
restricted the study population to people with type 2 
diabetes to limit indication bias (ie, bias that occurs 
when people are prescribed drugs for a condition that is 
itself associated with the risk of the adverse event under 
consideration). We used an incident user design to 
reduce, but not eliminate, confounding and biases that 
can otherwise arise from adjustment for intermediate 
characteristics in the causal path.36  There were some 
differences at baseline between patients prescribed dif-
ferent treatment groups (tables 1 and 2), although these 
were predominantly increased levels of comorbidities 
for insulin and lower levels of concurrent use of drugs 
(such as statins and aspirin) for metformin. To reduce 
channelling bias (where the choice of a particular drug 
is influenced by patient characteristics), we adjusted for 
a wide range of potential confounding variables. This 
included demographic characteristics (age, sex, ethnic-
ity, and deprivation), different comorbidities, clinical 
values (including haemoglobin A1c, body mass index, 
blood pressure, creatinine level, and cholesterol to high 
density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio), and concurrent 
drugs. However, we are unable to exclude the possibil-
ity of residual confounding because other unmeasured

patient characteristics might have affected the selection 
of diabetes drug treatment.
Although randomised controlled trials of diabetes 
drugs are not influenced by residual confounding, they 
tend to be small, of short duration, and might not report 
on relevant clinical outcomes. An alternative design 
would be an observational study of a cohort of patients 
specifically assembled for the purpose rather than 
using routinely collected data as in our study. Studies 
using routinely collected data are susceptible to miss-
ing data, although in our study over 99% of patients 
had smoking status recorded, 87% had ethnic group 
recorded, and over 82% had complete data for all five 
clinical values (table 2). We also used multiple imputa-
tion to deal with missing data. Other problems with rou-
tine data include coding errors and variable timing 
between measurements of risk factors because of differ-
ences in when patients present to their general practi-
tioner. Advantages of using routinely collected data 
rather than a purposeful cohort include size, efficiency, 
better generalisability, and less susceptibility to selec-
tion bias or attrition bias.
We fitted several different models and carried out 
sensitivity analyses that showed some heterogeneity of 
results with variations in point estimates. The results 
are therefore sensitive to the assumptions made in the 
study design and modelling and have uncertainty; how-
ever, our findings were generally consistent across the 
different analyses for glitazones and gliptins.
Conclusions
We have found clinically important differences in risk of 
cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and all cause 
mortality between different diabetes drugs alone and in 
combination compared with no drug treatment. Over-
all, use of gliptins or glitazones was associated with a 
decreased risk of heart failure, cardiovascular disease, 
and all cause mortality compared with non-use of these 
drugs. These results, which do not account for levels of 
adherence or dosage information and which are subject 
to confounding by indication, may have implications 
for prescribing of diabetes drugs.
