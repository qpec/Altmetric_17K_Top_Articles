abstract
Blood lead concentrations have decreased dramatically in US children 
over the past 4 decades, but too many children still live in housing with 
deteriorated lead-based paint and are at risk for lead exposure with 
resulting lead-associated cognitive impairment and behavioral problems. 
Evidence continues to accrue that commonly encountered blood lead 
concentrations, even those below 5 μg/dL (50 ppb), impair cognition; there 
is no identifi
 ed threshold or safe level of lead in blood. From 2007 to 2010, 
approximately 2.6% of preschool children in the United States had a blood 
lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb), which represents about 535 000 
US children 1 to 5 years of age. Evidence-based guidance is available for 
managing increased lead exposure in children, and reducing sources of 
lead in the environment, including lead in housing, soil, water, and consumer 
products, has been shown to be cost-benefi
 cial. Primary prevention should 
be the focus of policy on childhood lead toxicity.
OVERVIEW AND INTRODUCTION
Primary prevention, reducing or eliminating the myriad sources of lead in 
the environment of children before exposure occurs, is the most reliable 
and cost-effective measure to protect children from lead toxicity. Very 
high blood lead concentrations (eg, >100 μg/dL) can cause significant 
overt symptoms, such as protracted vomiting and encephalopathy, and 
even death. Low-level lead exposure, even at blood lead concentrations 
below 5 μg/dL (50 ppb), is a causal risk factor for diminished intellectual 
and academic abilities, higher rates of neurobehavioral disorders such as 
hyperactivity and attention deficits, and lower birth weight in children. 
No effective treatments ameliorate the permanent developmental effects 
of lead toxicity. Reducing lead exposure from residential lead hazards, 
industrial sources, contaminated foods or water, and other consumer 
products is an effective way to prevent or control childhood lead 
exposure. Lead poisoning prevention education directed at hand-washing 
or dust control fails to reduce children’s blood lead concentrations. 
However, pediatricians and parents should be aware of measures to 
reduce the toxic effects of lead on children, including the promulgation 
of regulations to screen or test older housing units for lead hazards

before occupancy and after major 
renovation and abatement; revision 
of federal standards to reduce 
allowable levels of lead in settled 
house dust, water, soil, cosmetics, 
and other consumer products; and 
enhanced protection for children 
who live in lead-contaminated 
communities or near lead-emitting 
industries.
SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
Over the past 4 decades, blood lead 
concentrations among US children 
have declined dramatically since the 
elimination of lead from gasoline, 
paints, and other consumer products1 
(Fig 1, Table 1). From 1976 to 1980, 
blood lead concentrations among 
US children declined more sharply 
than anticipated after the phase-
out of leaded gasoline.2 In 1978, 
the US Consumer Product Safety 
Commission (CPSC) restricted 
the allowable content of lead in 
residential paint to 0.06% (600 
ppm); in 2008, it was lowered to 
0.009% (90 ppm).3, 
4 There have also 
been significant reductions in tap 
water lead concentrations since the 
US Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) promulgated the Lead and 
Copper Rule.5, 
6 Finally, use of lead 
solder in canned foods and other 
consumer products was banned. It is 
difficult to accurately apportion the 
decline in blood lead concentrations 
to specific sources, but the combined 
effect of these regulations clearly 
led to the dramatic reductions in 
children’s blood lead concentrations.1 
The key to preventing lead toxicity 
in children is to reduce or eliminate 
persistent sources of lead exposure 
in their environment.
Prevention of low-level lead 
toxicity has historically focused on 
anticipatory guidance, screening 
children’s blood for lead after 
exposure, and iron or calcium 
supplementation to reduce lead 
absorption.7 Unfortunately, studies 
that evaluated the efficacy of parent 
education or provision of cleaning 
equipment to families failed to show 
significant reductions in children’s 
blood lead concentrations.8 Similarly, 
calcium and iron supplementation 
have not consistently been shown 
to be efficacious in reducing blood 
lead concentrations of children.9, 
10 
Collectively, these studies indicate 
that the focus of prevention should 
be on reducing the sources of 
childhood lead exposures rather 
than identifying children who have 
already been unduly exposed or 
attempting to ameliorate the toxic 
effects of lead exposure.
In 2005, the American Academy of 
Pediatrics (AAP) recognized that 
blood lead concentrations below 
10 μg/dL (100 ppb) may impair 
cognition; no threshold for the

toxic effects of lead was identified.7 
The AAP adopted a blood lead 
concentration >10 μg/dL (>100 
ppb) as the “level of concern” 
recommended by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), which indicated the need for 
closer medical and public health 
management.7 Extensive and 
compelling evidence now indicates 
that lead-associated cognitive deficits 
and behavioral problems can occur 
at blood lead concentrations below 
5 μg/dL (50 ppb). In 2012, the US 
National Toxicology Program of 
the National Institutes of Health 
reported that, after other risk 
factors are accounted for, blood 
lead concentrations <5 μg/dL (<50 
ppb) are strongly associated with 
intellectual deficits, diminished 
academic abilities, attention deficits, 
and problem behaviors (Table 2).11 
In that same year, the Advisory 
Committee on Childhood Lead 
Poisoning Prevention of the CDC 
concluded that there is no safe level 
of lead exposure and adopted the use 
of a reference value of ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 
ppb) (based on the 97.5th percentile 
of blood lead concentrations from 
the National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey [NHANES]) to be 
used as a trigger to guide clinical and 
public health interventions.12
Low-level elevations in children’s 
blood lead concentrations, even at 
concentrations below 5 μg/dL (50 
ppb), can result in decrements in 
cognitive functions, as measured 
by IQ scores and academic 
performance.13, 
14 For a given level 
of exposure, lead-associated IQ 
decrements are proportionately 
greater at the lowest blood lead 
concentrations. The IQ decrement 
associated with an increase in blood 
lead concentration from <1 μg/dL 
(<10 ppb) to 30 μg/dL (300 ppb) 
was 9.2 IQ points, but the decrement 
associated with an increase in blood 
lead concentration from <1 μg/dL 
(<10 ppb) to 10 μg/dL (100 ppb) 
was 6.2 IQ points.14 The population 
impact of lead on intellectual 
abilities is substantial. Despite the 
dramatic reductions in blood lead 
levels, lead toxicity accounts for an 
estimated total loss of 23 million 
IQ points among a 6-year cohort of 
contemporary US children.15
Focusing efforts on children who 
have blood lead concentrations 
≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb) is efficient but 
will fail to preserve the majority 
of lost IQ points in US children. 
The prevention paradox refers to 
the concept that most disease or 
disability occurs in low- to moderate-
risk groups. Children who have blood 
lead concentrations ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 
ppb) will, on average, experience

a lead-associated IQ deficit of 6.1 
points, an IQ deficit much larger 
than that of children who have lower 
blood lead concentrations (Fig 2). 
Still, if the focus is only on reducing 
exposures for children who have a 
blood lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL 
(≥50 ppb), we will fail to preserve 
more than 20 million (>80% of 
total) of the 23 million IQ points 
lost among US children with lower 
lead exposure because there are so 
many more children who have low to 
moderate blood lead concentrations 
(Fig 2). No therapeutic interventions 
currently exist for low blood lead 
concentrations; therefore, prevention 
of exposure is paramount. For these 
reasons, this statement focuses 
heavily on how pediatricians can help 
prevent lead exposure in children.
Elevated blood lead concentrations 
can result in the development of 
behavioral problems in children, 
including inattention, impulsivity, 
aggression, and hyperactivity.16–18 
In a nationally representative study 
of 8- to 15-year-old US children, 
Froehlich et al17 found that having 
a blood lead concentration >1.3 
μg/dL (>13 ppb) was associated 
with an elevated risk for attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD). Children with a blood lead 
concentration in the lowest tertile 
(<0.7 μg/dL, or <7 ppb) exhibited, 
on average, 1 symptom of ADHD, 
whereas children with a blood 
lead concentration in the highest 
tertile (>1.3 μg/dL, or >13 ppb) 
exhibited 3 symptoms. Some critics 
have argued that these “subtle” 
shifts in behavioral symptoms 
are inconsequential, but this shift 
in the population distribution of 
ADHD symptoms led to an increase 
in the percentage of children who 
met criteria for ADHD from 5% to 
13%. Approximately 1 in 5 cases of 
ADHD among US children have been 
attributed to lead exposure.17
Antisocial behaviors, including 
conduct disorder, delinquency, and 
criminal behaviors, can result from 
a variety of risk factors, but there is 
substantial evidence that lead toxicity 
is 1 of the major risk factors for their 
development.16, 
19–22 Needleman et al16 
found that adolescents who had 
higher bone lead concentrations had 
higher scores for delinquency and 
aggression. In a meta-analysis of 16 
studies, Marcus et al22 concluded that 
lead exposure, measured via blood 
lead or bone lead concentrations, was 
a risk factor for conduct disorder. In 
2 prospective longitudinal studies, 
higher childhood blood lead or 
tooth lead concentrations resulted 
in higher rates of self-reported 
delinquent behaviors and arrests or 
convictions.20, 
21 Reyes23 concluded 
that the reduction in population 
mean blood lead concentrations 
was the major risk factor associated 
with the decline in severe violent 
behaviors over the past 3 decades.
Limited evidence implicates lead 
exposure in diminished kidney 
function in adolescents at low levels 
of exposure.11 Using the NHANES, 
Fadrowski et al24 found that, among 
769 adolescents with a median blood 
lead concentration of 1.5 μg/dL (15 
ppb), a doubling of the concentration 
led to a significant reduction in the 
glomerular filtration rate. It is not 
clear whether chronic, low-level lead 
exposure in childhood or adolescence 
is sufficient to result in chronic renal 
failure or whether it is the cumulative 
effect of a variety of risk factors that 
ultimately results in the development 
of chronic renal failure. Still, this 
study is consistent with others 
linking lead exposure with chronic 
renal failure in adults.11
Lead can cause spontaneous 
abortion, low birth weight, and 
reduced growth in children. In a 
case–control study of pregnant 
women in Mexico City with blood 
lead concentrations that ranged 
from 1.3 μg/dL (13 ppb) to 29 
(290 ppb) μg/dL, the odds for 
spontaneous abortion increased 
by 1.8 for every 5-μg/dL (50-ppb) 
increase in maternal blood lead 
concentration.25 Early studies that 
examined the association of prenatal 
lead exposure and low birth weight 
or preterm birth, measured via 
either maternal or cord blood lead 
concentrations, found inconsistent 
results. However, in a large cohort 
involving more than 34 000 live 
births, investigators found that a 
5-μg/dL (50-ppb) increase in blood 
lead concentrations was associated 
with a 61-g decrement in birth 
weight.26 The National Toxicology 
Program concluded that maternal 
blood lead concentrations <5 μg/dL 
(<50 ppb) are associated with lower 
birth weight.
PREVENTING LEAD TOXICITY
Despite historical reductions in 
children’s blood lead concentrations, 
preventing childhood lead toxicity 
remains a major public health 
priority in the United States. Many 
children who live in older, poorly 
maintained housing or older 
housing that undergoes renovation 
are at high risk for lead exposure. 
In the NHANES conducted from 
2007 to 2010, approximately 
2.6% of preschool children in the 
United States had a blood lead 
concentration ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb), 
which represents about 535 000 
US children 1 to 5 years of age.12 
Children who lived in older housing 
units experienced an increased risk

the total). Adapted from Bellinger.15

for having a blood lead concentration 
in excess of 5 μg/dL (50 ppb); 15% 
of US children who lived in housing 
units built before 1950 had a blood 
lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 
ppb), whereas 4.2% of children 
who lived in housing built between 
1950 and 1978 had a blood lead 
concentration ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb), 
compared with 2.1% of children 
who lived in housing units built after 
1978.27 No treatments have been 
shown to be effective in ameliorating 
the permanent developmental 
effects of lead toxicity.28 Finally, the 
economic costs of childhood lead 
toxicity are substantial. Despite the 
historical reductions in blood lead 
concentrations, it has been estimated 
that the annual cost of childhood lead 
exposure in the United States is $50 
billion.29 For every $1 invested to 
reduce lead hazards in housing units, 
society would benefit by an estimated 
$17 to $221, a cost–benefit ratio that 
is comparable with the cost–benefit 
ratio for childhood vaccines.30
The key to preventing lead toxicity 
in children is identification and 
elimination of the major sources of 
lead exposure. Primary prevention 
of lead exposure is now widely 
recognized as the optimal strategy 
because of the irreversible effects 
of low-level lead toxicity.7, 
12 The 
primary prevention approach 
contrasts with practices and 
policies that too often have relied 
predominantly on detection of lead 
exposure only after children develop 
elevated blood lead concentrations.
SOURCES AND VARIABILITY OF LEAD 
EXPOSURE
Lead ingestion and absorption are 
dynamic during the first 2 years 
of life. Blood lead concentrations 
of children who live in lead-
contaminated environments typically 
increase rapidly between 6 and 12 
months of age, peak between 18 and 
36 months of age, and then gradually 
decrease.31 The peak in children’s 
blood lead concentrations stems from 
the confluence of normal mouthing 
behaviors and increasing mobility.31 
Younger children also absorb lead 
more efficiently than older children 
and adults.32 Iron deficiency can also 
increase the absorption of lead.33
A large number of housing units in 
the United States contain lead-based 
paint. In a national survey of housing 
conducted in 2011, it was estimated 
that 37 million (35%) of 106 million 
housing units contain lead-based 
paint.34 Lead-based paint is the 
most common, highly concentrated 
source of lead exposure for children 
who live in older housing.35 Paint 
that was used on both the interior 
and exterior of houses through 
the 1950s contained higher 
concentrations of lead than that of 
houses built in later years.34, 
35 The 
lead concentration in paint and other 
media can be measured by using 
a hand-held instrument called the 
x-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrum 
analyzer or by chemically analyzing 
paint chips.
The US Department of Housing 
and Urban Development (HUD) 
defines lead-based paint as an 
XRF reading ≥1 μg/cm2 or 5000 
ppm of lead in a paint chip.36 The 
presence of lead-based paint is 
not as predictive of childhood lead 
exposure as a lead paint hazard. A 
lead paint hazard is defined by the 
EPA as “any condition that causes 
exposure to lead from contaminated 
dust, lead-contaminated soil, or 
lead-contaminated paint that is 
deteriorated, or the presence of 
accessible (or chewable) surfaces, 
friction surfaces or impact surfaces 
that would result in adverse human 
health effects.”37
Age of the housing is a major 
determinant of lead paint hazards. 
For housing built from 1978 to 
1998, 2.7% contained one or more 
lead paint hazards, whereas the 
prevalence of residential hazards 
increased to 11.4% of housing built 
from 1960 to 1977, 39% of housing 
built from 1940 to 1959, and 67% 
of housing units built before 1940.34 
Federal regulations for defining a 
lead paint hazard in house dust are 
obsolete. Federal agencies have set 
environmental lead standards to 
protect children from having a blood 
lead concentration ≥10 μg/dL (≥100 
ppb), but it is now recognized that 
there is no safe level of lead exposure. 
Therefore, because the current 
standards for lead in house dust, 
water, and soil remain too high to 
protect children, 
31, 
38 the percentage 
of housing that contains one or more 
lead paint hazards described above is 
an underestimate.
Lead-based paint is the major 
source of lead, but ingestions of 
lead-contaminated house dust 
and residential soil are the major 
pathways for exposure (Fig 3).35–42 
House dust, which can be 
contaminated by small particles 
of lead-based paint or track-in of 
lead-contaminated soil, is a major 
pathway of lead exposure for 
children who live in older, poorly 
maintained housing.40 Ingestions of 
lead-contaminated house dust and 
soil are also the primary pathways 
of exposure for children who live in 
homes that were recently abated or 
renovated.43–45
Sampling house dust for lead hazards 
involves using a special wipe to 
sample a specified area, such as the 
floor, which is readily accessible to 
a child, or a window sill or window 
trough.36 Windows are often more 
heavily contaminated than floors 
because exterior paints often 
contained higher concentrations of 
lead, and window troughs can act as 
reservoirs. Sampling house dust for 
lead is used to screen older housing 
units that may contain lead hazards 
at the time of purchase or rental 
and before occupancy; to conduct 
a full risk assessment that involves 
extensive sampling of settled dust 
in housing units that failed a lead 
hazard screen or where there is a 
high probability of a lead hazard;

and to conduct clearance testing 
after repair or renovation of painted 
surfaces and after lead abatement, to 
verify that the housing unit is safe for 
occupancy (Table 3).38
Lead-contaminated soil is an 
important source of lead intake for 
children.40, 
41 Lead-contaminated soil 
can directly contribute to children’s 
blood lead concentrations via soil 
ingestion and indirectly from soil 
tracked indoors on shoes, which 
then contaminates house dust 
(Fig 3). Former mine and smelter 
communities present a particular 
risk to children for the ingestion 
of lead-contaminated soil, but lead 
in urban soil also is often heavily 
contaminated from the past use of 
leaded gasoline and paints. Other 
sources of lead in soil include 
weathering of lead-based exterior 
paint and nearby renovation or 
demolition activity. Soil testing is 
usually performed in areas where 
children play and the foundation 
perimeter. The EPA standards are 
400 μg of lead per gram of soil for 
play areas and 1200 μg/g for the 
foundation perimeter.37 Children’s 
blood lead concentrations increase 
by approximately 3.8 μg/dL (38 ppb) 
for every 1000-ppm increase in soil 
lead concentration.40
Water is an important but often 
overlooked source of exposure for 
children, especially for infants who 
are formula fed.5, 
46, 
47 Water typically 
contributes to approximately 20% of 
a child’s blood lead concentrations if 
the water lead concentration exceeds 
5 ppb (Fig 3).31 The contribution of 
lead from water can be much higher 
for some children, especially for 
infants who ingest large quantities of 
tap water.5, 
46, 
47 Children who reside 
in communities with lead service 
lines and inadequate anticorrosion 
control are also at increased risk for 
elevated blood lead concentrations.48
Phasing out leaded gasoline and 
creating stricter national air lead 
standards led to large reductions in 
the contribution of airborne lead to 
children’s blood lead concentrations. 
Still, in some communities, such as 
those surrounding regional airports, 
airborne lead is an important source 
of lead exposure. Airborne lead is 
ingested primarily after it settles in 
house dust and soil where children 
play. Current sources of airborne 
lead include lead battery recycling 
operations, piston engine aircraft, 
and incinerators.49 The contributions 
of airborne lead to children’s 
blood lead concentrations are 
proportionately greater at the lower 
levels of exposure than at higher 
levels.49
Other sources of lead intake for 
children have been identified, such 
as nutritional supplements and 
folk medicines, ceramic dishware, 
and cosmetics50–52 (Table 3).

Lead brought into the home from 
a worksite by a parent can also 
be a major source of exposure 
for some children.53 Consumer 
products such as children’s toys, 
lunch boxes, crayons, and lipstick 
that are contaminated with lead 
have received a great deal of 
attention. These products constitute 
a small source of lead intake for 
most children, but they can be the 
major source for an individual 
child. Moreover, because lead 
exposure is cumulative and there 
is no apparent threshold for the 
adverse effects of lead exposure, all 
sources of lead exposure should be 
eliminated. It is the responsibility 
of the relevant federal agencies, 
such as the CPSC and the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA), to 
promulgate and enforce standards 
that will protect children from lead-
contaminated consumer products.
RESIDENTIAL STANDARDS FOR LEAD IN 
PAINT, DUST, AND WATER
Lead in Paint and Dust
Under section 403 of Title X, the 
US Congress mandated the EPA to 
promulgate residential health-based 
lead standards that are designed to 
protect children from lead toxicity.37 
Standards are necessary to identify 
lead hazards before a child is unduly 
exposed and to identify the source of 
lead exposure for children who have 
blood lead concentrations ≥5 μg/dL 
(≥50 ppb).31 Unless performed 
carefully, attempts to reduce lead 
exposure, such as abatement, repair, 
or renovation, can result in increased 
contamination and elevation in a 
child’s blood lead concentration.43–45 
Dust clearance tests, which involve 
collecting dust from floors or 
windows of a home by using a 
lead-free material that resembles 
a baby wipe, should be conducted 
after extensive repair, renovation, 
or abatement of older housing units 
to determine whether the housing 
intervention was sufficient to protect 
children from lead hazards, especially 
in housing units built before 1960.27, 
34 
Property owners are required to 
disclose possible presence of lead-
based paint in properties built before 
1978 and are required to provide 
the blue pamphlet from the EPA, 
HUD, and Consumer Product Safety 
Commission titled “Protect Your 
Family From Lead in Your Home” at 
the time of rental or sale.
Most existing lead standards fail to 
protect children (Table 4). In 1978, 
the CPSC set the maximum paint lead 
concentration at 0.06% (600 ppm), 
because there was evidence that 
paint could be manufactured with 
this lower level of contamination.3 
Similarly, the EPA’s action level of 
15 ppb of lead in water, which is 
used to regulate water systems in 
the United States, is routinely (but 
erroneously) used as a health-based 
standard; it was not intended as a 
health-based standard, nor does 
it adequately protect children or 
pregnant women from adverse 
effects of lead exposure.5, 
31 In 1988, 
the HUD established a postabatement 
floor dust standard of 200 μg/ft2 
because there was evidence 
that it was feasible to attain, not 
because it was demonstrated to 
be safe or protective. In 2001, the 
EPA promulgated residential lead 
standards of 40 μg/ft2 for floors 
and 250 μg/ft2 for window sills.37 
Unfortunately, these standards, 
which failed to protect children from 
having a blood lead concentration 
≥10 μg/dL (≥100 ppb) when they 
were first promulgated, dictate 
the levels of lead contamination 
considered “normal” or “low, 
” and 
they provide an illusion of safety.38, 
40 
At a floor standard of 40 μg/ft2, the 
current EPA standard for floors, 50% 
of children were estimated to have a 
blood lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL 
(≥50 ppb); 5% of children have a 
blood lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL 
(≥50 ppb) at a median floor dust lead 
level of 1.5 μg/ft2 (Fig 4).42
Scraping, sanding, or construction 
during painting, repair, renovation, 
or abatement of older housing can 
result in lead contamination of a 
child’s environment.41,

<22 μg/dL (<220 ppb), Aschengrau 
et al41 reported a 6.5-μg/dL (65-ppb) 
increase in blood lead concentrations 
for children whose homes had 
undergone paint abatement. Clark 
et al44 reported that 6-month-old 
infants were 11 times more likely to 
have a ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb) increase 
in blood lead concentrations after 
abatement compared with older 
children. Spanier et al45 reported that 
routine renovation of older housing 
was associated with a 12% higher 
mean blood lead concentration. 
These studies indicate that the 
levels of lead-contaminated dust 
generated by lead hazard control 
work or housing renovations can 
result in excessive lead exposure 
and absorption for children unless 
there is sufficient cleanup and 
clearance testing after the work is 
completed. The HUD has published 
technical guidelines and regulations 
for workers involved in lead-based 
paint abatement or remediation of 
housing.36
In 1992, the US Congress mandated 
the EPA to promulgate regulations 
to protect children from lead 
exposure resulting from housing 
repairs and renovation.37 In 2011, 
the EPA finalized recommendations 
for the Lead Renovation, Repair 
and Painting Rule.54 Unfortunately, 
the EPA failed to recommend the 
validated wipe-sampling method for 
clearance testing. Instead, it used an 
unvalidated cloth test, which should 
not be confused with the validated 
wipe sampling test. The white cloth 
test assumes that if dust is visible 
on a white cloth (ie, the “white glove 
test”), it contains a lead hazard; 
conversely, if there is no visible dust, 
it does not contain a lead hazard.54 
Although it would be valuable to have 
a quick test to identify the presence 
of a lead hazard, the white cloth test 
is not a validated tool and is not a 
reliable way to quantify the presence 
of a lead hazard.
Lead hazard control work can 
result in sizable reductions in the 
magnitude of dust lead loading 
when proper procedures are 
followed and cleanup and postwork 
clearance testing are performed. In 
1 study, dust lead levels (measured 
as micrograms of lead per area) 
immediately after professional 
abatement were 8.5 μg/ft2, 8.0 μg/ft2, 
and 21 μg/ft2 for floors, interior 
window sills, and window troughs, 
respectively, representing reductions 
of more than 80% compared with 
preabatement levels.55 In another 
study of more than 2600 housing 
units, postabatement dust lead levels 
were 12 μg/ft2, 31 μg/ft2, and 32 
μg/ft2 for floors, window sills and 
window troughs, respectively.56 
These levels were achieved with dust 
clearance testing set at 100 μg/ft2 
or higher, but floor dust lead levels 
below 5 μg/ft2 can be achieved by 
following a specific protocol. In 1 
unpublished study of more than 160 
housing units built before 1978, 1 
group found that it is possible to 
routinely meet floor lead levels below 
5 μg/ft2 after housing renovations 
costing an average of $5600 
(B. Lanphear, MD, MPH, Simon Fraser 
University, unpublished data).
Lead in Water
The primary sources of lead in water, 
which can be dissolved or particulate, 
consist of lead service lines, lead 
solder, and brass fittings that 
contain high concentrations of lead.5 
Plumbing installed before 1986, 
the year a federal ban was issued 
on using lead pipe and lead solder 
and a maximum lead content of 8% 
by weight for brass plumbing was 
established, is more likely to contain 
higher concentrations of lead.5 Lead 
services lines that are being replaced, 
are undergoing maintenance, or are 
damaged can release particles of 
lead that can be ingested.57 Partial 
service line replacement, which is 
sometimes performed to minimize 
the cost of service line repair by 
water authorities, fails to reduce 
lead exposure.57 Proper maintenance 
and ultimately full replacement of 
water service lines will be necessary 
to eliminate lead intake from water, 
but it must be performed with 
proper precautions. In the interim,

water filters that are certified by the 
National Sanitation Foundation for 
lead removal can effectively reduce 
water lead concentrations. The 
EPA recommends running the cold 
water of residential units for up to 
2 minutes to flush the lead leached 
from pipes out of the plumbing 
system, but flushing is useful only in 
housing units without lead service 
lines.58–61 In housing units without 
lead service lines, and where the 
primary source is brass fittings or 
lead-soldered joints, a 1-minute 
flush may be sufficient, depending on 
the length of plumbing; for housing 
units with lead service lines, flushing 
may increase lead exposure, again 
depending on the length of the lead 
service lines.58–61
Drinking fountains in older schools 
can be an important source of lead 
exposure.5 Unfortunately, there are 
no regulations for evaluating lead 
contamination of school drinking 
fountains in most states.
Implementation of the Lead and 
Copper Rule has significantly reduced 
tap water lead levels. In 1991, the 
US EPA set an action level for lead 
in water of 15 μg/L or (15 ppb).6 
Communities in which >10% of 
water samples taken from various 
taps throughout the system exceed 
15 ppb are considered to be out of 
compliance and are required by 
the EPA to take action to reduce 
lead levels using corrosion control 
methods or replacement of lead 
service lines. The action level is used 
as an administrative tool to evaluate 
community-level exposure; it is not a 
health-based standard. The maximum 
contaminant level goal, the value the 
EPA deems acceptable for health, is 0.
Testing Asymptomatic Children for 
Elevated Blood Lead Concentrations
In the primary care office, 
primary prevention begins with 
education and counseling. Ideally, 
environmental assessments, such 
as screening older housing units, 
occurs before a child is born so that 
parents can identify and hire trained 
workers to abate environmental 
lead exposure hazards.12 It is 
especially important to conduct an 
environmental assessment for lead 
if a family resides in a housing unit 
built before 1960 that has undergone 
recent renovation, repair, or painting 
or if it is poorly maintained.
Screening questionnaires frequently 
used in the primary care setting fail to 
identify children who have elevated 
blood lead concentrations, 
62 but they 
may be useful as a tool to identify 
lead hazards in children who have a 
blood lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL 
(≥50 ppb). In addition, public health 
agencies often use other methods 
of targeting children who should be 
screened with a blood lead test on the 
basis of community and residential 
characteristics, such as older housing. 
Blood lead surveillance data can be 
used to identify cities, communities, 
or housing units at higher than typical 
risk for lead poisoning. Technologies 
using geographic information system–
based analyses and surveillance 
from electronic medical records are 
important tools to identify at-risk 
children who should have their blood 
lead concentration measured.
In 1991, the CDC recommended 
universal blood lead testing for 
all children.63 In 2005, the AAP 
recommended that states and cities 
formulate their own lead screening 
recommendations on the basis of local 
data because of the wide variation in 
lead exposure.7 The AAP, consistent 
with the CDC, recommended universal 
screening of children’s blood for 
lead if they lived in communities 
with more than 27% of housing built 
before 1950 or a prevalence of blood 
lead concentrations ≥10 μg/dL in 
children 12 to 36 months old of 12% 
or greater.7, 
12, 
63, 
64 Screening is not 
efficient after 36 months of age unless 
specific high-risk factors are identified; 
the likelihood of a child having a 
blood lead concentration >10 μg/dL 
after 36 months of age is low.65 These 
recommendations now need to be 
updated to conform to with our new 
understanding of lead toxicity.11, 
12
A detailed evaluation and follow-up 
of children who have blood lead 
concentrations <10 μg/dL (<100 ppb) 
is now indicated. Current federal 
regulations for clinical laboratory 
testing through the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments of 198866 
permit an allowable laboratory error 
in blood lead proficiency testing 
programs of ±4 μg/dL (±40 ppb) 
for blood lead concentrations ≤20 
μg/dL (≤200 ppb). This range of 
error can result in children being 
misclassified and cause additional 
anxiety or false comfort when blood 
lead concentrations within the margin 
of error erroneously are interpreted 
as going up or down. The majority 
of laboratories analyzing blood lead 
reference materials routinely achieved 
laboratory error of ±2 μg/dL (±20 
ppb) at blood lead concentrations ≤20 
μg/dL (≤200 ppb).67 Changing the 
allowable laboratory error to tighter 
performance requirements, such as 
±2 μg/dL (±20 ppb), could decrease 
misclassification of children and lead 
to better allocation of health care 
resources.
Case Management of Children With 
a Blood Lead Concentration at or 
Above Reference Value
The AAP is adopting the current 
reference value of ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 
ppb) for case management.12 
The CDC recommended that the 
97.5th percentile of blood lead 
concentrations derived from the 
combination of the 2 most recent 
cycles of NHANES data be used 
to identify children who have 
unacceptably high exposure and to 
set public health goals.12 The CDC will 
reconsider the reference value for 
children’s blood lead concentrations 
every 4 years.12
After confirmatory testing, it is 
important to monitor children who 
have blood lead concentrations 
9

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb). The pediatrician 
should inform the local or state health 
department and request an inspection 
of the child’s house to identify and 
remediate any lead hazards (Table 4). 
Screening children for iron deficiency 
and insufficient dietary calcium 
intake is also important.7 A detailed 
description of the diagnosis and 
treatment of significant lead toxicity 
(ie, ≥45 μg/dL [≥450 ppb]) is beyond 
the scope of this policy statement, 
but guidance is available in an earlier 
publication of the AAP7 and through 
the Pediatric Environmental Health 
Specialty Units Web site (www. 
pehsu. 
net) (Table 5). Children who have 
elevated blood lead concentrations 
need to be monitored until 
environmental investigations and 
remediation are complete and blood 
lead concentrations decline.12
The AAP recognizes that 
environmental investigations will 
typically be conducted by local 
or state health or environmental 
departments to identify sources of 
lead exposure for a child who has a 
blood lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL 
(≥50 ppb). In many cases, however, 
the pediatrician can provide clues 
about possible sources of lead intake 
by taking a careful history.
Case management involves a 
thorough investigation of potential 
sources of lead poisoning in a child’s 
environment, including paint, house 
dust, water, and soil. Case management 
also includes a questionnaire and 
visual inspection for other potential 
sources of lead exposure, including 
antique furniture, toys, ethnic folk 
remedies, and consumer products 
such as imported food, cosmetics, and 
ceramics.12, 
50–52 It can include testing 
deteriorated paint on furniture, such as

TABLE 5  
AAP Recommendations on Management of Childhood Lead Exposure and Poisoning
Lead Level
Recommendation
<5 μg/dL (<50 ppb)
1. Review laboratory results with family. For reference, the geometric mean blood lead concentration for US children 1–5 
y old is <2 μg/dL (<20 ppb); 2.5% have a blood lead concentration ≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb).
2. Repeat the blood lead concentration in 6–12 mo if the child is at high risk for lead exposure or if risk profi
 le increases. 
Follow all local and state lead screening recommendations.
3. For children initially screened before 12 mo of age, consider retesting in 3–6 mo for children at high risk; lead exposure 
may increase as mobility increases.
4. Perform routine assessment of nutrition and physical and mental development and assess risk factors for iron 
defi
 ciency.
5. Provide anticipatory guidance about common sources of environmental lead exposure: paint in homes or child care 
facilities built before 1960, soil near roadways, take-home exposures related to adult occupations, and imported spices, 
cosmetics, folk remedies, and cookware.
5–14 μg/dL (50–140 ppb)
1. Perform steps as described above for blood lead concentrations <5 μg/dL (<50 ppb).
2. Retest venous blood lead concentration within 1–3 mo to verify that the lead concentration is not rising. If it is stable 
or decreasing, retest the blood lead concentration in 3 mo. Refer patient to local health authorities if such resources 
are available. Most states require elevated blood lead concentrations be reported to the state health department.

lead or the National Lead Information Center at 
800-424-LEAD (5323) for resources regarding lead poisoning prevention and local childhood lead poisoning prevention 
programs.
3. Take a careful environmental history to identify potential sources of exposures (see #5 above) and provide preliminary 
advice about reducing or eliminating exposures. Take care to consider other children who may be exposed.
4. Provide nutritional counseling related to calcium and iron. Encourage the consumption of iron-enriched foods (eg, 
cereals, meats). Encourage families to sign up for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and 
Children, if eligible.
5. Screen for iron suffi
 ciency with adequate laboratory testing (complete blood cell count, ferritin, C-reactive protein) and 
provide treatment per AAP guidelines. Consider starting a multivitamin with iron.
6. Perform structured developmental screening evaluations at child health maintenance visits, because lead’s effect on 
development may manifest over years.
15–44 μg/dL (150–440 ppb)
1. Perform steps as described above for blood lead concentrations 5–14 μg/dL (50–140 ppb).
2. Confi
 rm the blood lead concentration with repeat venous sample within 1–4 wk.
3. Abdominal radiography should be considered for children who have a history of pica for paint chips or excessive 
mouthing behaviors. Gut decontamination may be considered if leaded foreign bodies are visualized on radiography. 
Any treatment of blood lead concentrations in this range should be provided in consultation with an expert. Contact 
local pediatric environmental health specialty unit (www. 
pehsu. 
net or 888-347-2632) or local or regional Poison Control 
Center (www. 
aapcc. 
org or 800-222-1222) for guidance.
>44 μg/dL (>440 ppb)
1. Follow guidance for blood lead level 15–44 μg/dL (150–440 ppb) as listed above.
2. Confi
 rm the blood lead concentration with repeat venous lead level within 48 h.
3. Consider hospitalization or chelation therapy (managed with the assistance of an experienced provider). Safety of 
the home or child care facility with respect to lead hazards, isolation of the lead source, family social situation, and 
chronicity of the exposure are factors that may infl
 uence management. Contact your regional pediatric environmental 
health specialty unit or Poison Control Center or the CDC for assistance.

SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Lead toxicity results in substantial, 
population-level effects on children’s 
intellectual abilities, academic 
abilities, problem behaviors, and 
birth weight. Pediatricians may be 
well equipped to advocate for more 
stringent regulations to reduce 
sources of lead exposure and prevent 
childhood lead exposure. The AAP 
recognizes the importance of a variety 
of educational, enforcement, and 
environmental actions to reduce the 
number of children who are exposed 
to lead hazards and concur with 
recent detailed recommendations for 
prioritization of primary prevention 
of lead toxicity.7, 
12, 
68–70 The AAP offers 
the following recommendations for 
government as well as pediatricians, 
other health care providers, and 
public health officials.
Recommendations for Government
1. The federal government should 
expand the resources currently 
offered by the HUD to local 
and state governments for lead 
hazard control work.
2. The federal government should 
provide both financial and 
nonfinancial resources and 
technical guidance through the 
CDC, the EPA, and the HUD to 
state and local public health 
agencies as well as environmental 
and housing agencies engaged 
in childhood lead poisoning 
prevention efforts.
3. The US EPA and HUD should 
review their protocols for 
identifying and mitigating 
residential lead hazards (eg, 
lead-based paint, dust, and soil) 
and lead-contaminated water 
from lead service lines or lead 
solder and revise downward the 
allowable levels of lead in house 
dust, soil, paint, and water to 
conform with the recognition 
that there are no safe levels of 
lead.
4. The federal government should 
resume and expand its vital 
role in providing federal public 
health leadership in childhood 
lead poisoning prevention work 
through the CDC. Allocation of 
additional resources would be 
necessary to accomplish this goal.
5. The Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services, which is 
responsible for regulating 
clinical laboratory testing 
through the Clinical Laboratory 
Improvement Amendments of 
1988, 
69 should expeditiously 
revise current regulations 
for allowable laboratory 
error permitted in blood lead 
proficiency testing programs 
from ±4 μg/dL (±40 ppb) to ±2 
μg/dL (±20 ppb) for blood lead 
concentrations ≤20 μg/dL (≤200 
ppb).12 In the future, when 
feasible, allowable laboratory 
error permitted in blood lead 
proficiency testing programs 
should be reduced even more, 
to ±1 μg/dL (±10 ppb) for blood 
lead concentrations ≤20 μg/dL 
(≤200 ppb).
6. The federal government 
should continue to conduct the 
NHANES and provide national 
data on trends in blood lead 
concentrations. These newer 
data should be used by the 
CDC to periodically formulate 
a new reference value and 
guide clinical and public health 
interventions.
7. The federal government should 
continue to regularly survey 
children and adolescents in the 
NHANES for ADHD and conduct 
disorder by using validated 
diagnostic surveys from the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition 
to examine the association of 
lower blood lead concentrations 
with these conditions.
8. Local or state governments, in 
consultation with pediatricians, 
should develop policies 
and regulations requiring 
the remediation of lead-
contaminated housing and 
child care facilities, including 
the elimination of lead hazards 
during transfer of rental units 
or renovation or demolition of 
older housing.
9. State and local governments 
should collect, analyze, and 
publish blood lead test results 
performed in their jurisdictions 
and should regularly publish 
reports of age of housing and 
other risk factors for children 
having blood lead concentrations 
≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb). These 
reports should be readily 
available to pediatricians, health 
care providers, and the public.
10. Federal, state, and local 
governments should provide 
resources for environmental 
evaluations and case 
management of children who 
have blood lead concentrations 
≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb), in 
conjunction with the child’s 
primary care provider.
11. State and local governments 
should take steps to ensure 
that water fountains in schools 
do not exceed water lead 
concentrations of 1 ppb.
Recommendations for Pediatricians, 
Health Care Providers, and Public 
Health Offi
 cials
1. Pediatricians are in a unique 
position to work with public 
health officials to conduct surveys 
of blood lead concentrations 
among a randomly selected, 
11
 by guest on June 4, 2019
www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
representative sample of children 
in their states or communities at 
regular intervals to identify trends 
in blood lead concentrations. 
These periodic surveys are 
especially important for children 
who live in highly contaminated 
communities, such as smelter 
communities or regions with a 
historically high prevalence of 
lead exposure.
2. Pediatricians, heath care 
providers, and public health 
officials should routinely 
recommend individual 
environmental assessments of 
older housing, 
12 particularly 
if a family resides in a housing 
unit built before 1960 that has 
undergone recent renovation, 
repair, or painting or that has 
been poorly maintained.
3. Pediatricians and public health 
officials should advocate for the 
promulgation and enforcement 
of strict legal standards based 
on empirical data that regulate 
allowable levels of lead in air, 
water, soil, house dust, and 
consumer products. These 
standards should address the 
major sources of lead exposure, 
including industrial emissions, 
lead paint in older housing, lead-
contaminated soil, water service 
lines, and consumer products.
4. Pediatricians should be familiar 
with collection and interpretation 
of reports of lead hazards found in 
house dust, soil, paint, and water, 
or they should be able to refer 
families to a pediatrician, health 
care provider, or specialist who is 
familiar with these tools.
5. Pediatricians, women’s health 
care providers, and public health 
officials should be familiar 
with federal, state, local, and 
professional recommendations 
or requirements for screening 
children and pregnant women for 
lead poisoning.12, 
68, 
69
6. Pediatricians and other 
primary care providers 
should test asymptomatic 
children for elevated blood 
lead concentrations according 
to federal, local, and state 
requirements. Immigrant, refugee, 
and internationally adopted 
children also should be tested 
for blood lead concentrations 
when they arrive in the United 
States because of their increased 
risk.71, 
72 Blood lead tests do not 
need to be duplicated, but the 
pediatrician or other primary care 
provider should attempt to verify 
that screening was performed 
elsewhere and determine the 
result before testing is deferred 
during the office visit.
7. Pediatricians and other primary 
care health providers should 
conduct targeted screening of 
children for elevated blood lead 
concentrations if they are 12 
to 24 months of age and live in 
communities or census block 
groups with ≥25% of housing built 
before 1960 or a prevalence of 
children’s blood lead concentrations 
≥5 μg/dL (≥50 ppb) of ≥5%.
8. Pediatricians and other primary 
care providers should test 
children for elevated blood lead 
concentrations if they live in or 
visit a home or child care facility 
with an identified lead hazard or a 
home built before 1960 that is in 
poor repair or was renovated in 
the past 6 months.7, 
12
9. Pediatricians and primary care 
providers should work with 
their federal, state, and local 
governments to ensure that a 
comprehensive environmental 
inspection is conducted in the 
housing units of children who have 
blood lead concentrations ≥5 μg/
dL (≥50 ppb) and that they receive 
appropriate case management.
