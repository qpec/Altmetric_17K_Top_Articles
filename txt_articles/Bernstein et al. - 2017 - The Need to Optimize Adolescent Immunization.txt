abstract
The adolescent period heralds the pediatric patient’s transition into 
adulthood. It is a time of dynamic development during which effective 
preventive care measures can promote safe behaviors and the development 
of lifelong health habits. One of the foundations of preventive adolescent 
health care is timely vaccination, and every visit can be viewed as an 
opportunity to update and complete an adolescent’s immunizations.
In the past decade, the adolescent immunization schedule has expanded to 
include 2 doses of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine, 1 dose of 
tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis, absorbed vaccine, 2 or 3 doses of 
human papillomavirus vaccine, depending on the child’s age, and an annual 
infl
 uenza vaccine. In addition, during adolescent visits, health care providers 
can determine whether catch-up vaccination is needed to meet early 
childhood recommendations for hepatitis B; hepatitis A; measles, mumps, 
rubella; poliovirus; and varicella vaccines. New serogroup B meningococcal 
vaccines are now available for those at increased risk for meningococcal 
disease; in addition, these serogroup B meningococcal vaccines received 
a Category B recommendation for healthy adolescents, where individual 
counseling and risk–benefi
 t evaluation based on health care provider 
judgements and patient preferences are indicated. This clinical report 
focuses on the epidemiology of adolescent vaccine-preventable diseases by 
reviewing the rationale for the annual universally recommended adolescent 
immunization schedule of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the 
American Academy of Family Physicians, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. 
In addition, the barriers that negatively infl
 uence adherence to this current 
adolescent immunization schedule will be highlighted.

formatted as a single schedule for 
children ages 0 through 18 years, 
with footnotes that highlight vaccine 
recommendations for individuals 
in specific circumstances, including 
those with high-risk conditions.
The recommended schedule for 
healthy adolescents 
3 includes:
 
• quadrivalent meningococcal 
conjugate vaccine (MenACWY): 1 
dose at 11 through 12 years of age, 
with a booster dose at 16 years of 
age;
 
• serogroup B meningococcal 
vaccines (MenB): 16 through 
18 years of age (category B 
recommendation; A Category 
B recommendation indicates 
individual counseling and risk 
benefit evaluation that depends on 
provider judgment);
 
• tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular 
pertussis, absorbed vaccine 
(Tdap): 1 dose at 11 through 12 
years of age; pregnant adolescents 
should receive 1 dose during each 
pregnancy at 27 through 36 weeks 
of gestation;
 
• human papillomavirus (HPV) 
vaccine: 2 doses at 9 through 14 
years of age for persons at 0 and 6 
to 12 months; 3 doses for persons 
15 through 26 years of age and 
9 through 26 years of age for 
immunocompromised at 0, 1 to 2, 
and 6 months;
 
• influenza: 1 dose every year.
 
Figure 1 compares immunization 
rates for Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV 
vaccine. The Healthy People 2020 
goals for immunization coverage 
specify target immunization rates 
of 80% for ≥1 Tdap dose, for ≥1 
MenACWY dose, and for 3 HPV 
vaccine doses (the recommended 
schedule before October 2016). 
4 As 
of 2015, in 43 states and the District 
of Columbia, ≥80% of adolescents 
13 through 17 years of age had 
received Tdap, 
 
5 but in only 23 states 
and the District of Columbia, ≥80% 
of adolescents 13 through 17 years 
of age had received MenACWY. 
6 
Uptake of HPV vaccine lags far 
behind both of these vaccines, 
however, for both boys and girls, as 
does uptake of influenza vaccine: 
for the 2015–2016 influenza season, 
the influenza vaccination rate for 
adolescents 13 through 17 years of 
age was 46.8%.7
Vaccination rates also vary 
considerably by vaccine and by 
state. 
5, 
 
6 The National Immunization 
Survey (NIS)–Teen showed the 
immunization rates of adolescents 
receiving at least 1 dose of 
Tdap ranged from 70% to 97%, 
whereas rates for at least 1 dose 
of MenACWY ranged from 55% to 
98%. Completion of the 3-dose HPV 
vaccine series ranged from 24% to 
68% in girls and from 16% to 58% in 
boys. 
8
Although HPV vaccination rates are 
improving slowly, they continue to 
be far behind Tdap and MenACWY 
vaccination rates for both boys and 
girls. Compared with 2014, national 
vaccination rates in 2015 have 
increased to 81% for MenACWY 
but decreased to 86% from 88% 
for Tdap. Meanwhile, only 63% of 
girls received at least 1 dose of 
HPV vaccine, and 42% completed 
the 3-dose series. Rates for boys 
were even lower, with 50% of boys 
having received at least 1 dose of 
the HPV vaccine series and only 
28% having completed the 3-dose 
series. 
8 In addition, there are 
distinct missed opportunities to 
administer adolescent vaccines, 
particularly HPV vaccine. If HPV 
vaccine had been administered 
during the same visit at which 
another recommended vaccine, 
such as Tdap, was given, the 
vaccination rate of 13-year-old girls

Current data demonstrate a need 
for improvement in adolescent 
immunization rates. 
10 Understanding 
the epidemiology and current vaccine 
recommendations in the adolescent 
schedule is important to optimize 
health care for adolescents. 
11, 
 
12 
Although barriers to optimizing 
immunization rates persist, 
familiarity with this information 
should enable health care providers 
to create better implementation 
strategies to enhance vaccine 
coverage. The increased flexibility 
created by the recent shift to a 2-dose 
schedule for HPV vaccine for persons 
initiating the series at 9 through 14 
years of age is anticipated to increase 
completion rates, but additional 
efforts will be needed to reach the 
Healthy People 2020 goal of 80%.
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ADOLESCENT 
VACCINE-PREVENTABLE DISEASES
Meningococcal Vaccines
Meningococcal disease affects all 
age groups, with increased 
infection rates seen among infants, 
adolescents, and the elderly ( 
Fig 2). 
Complications of meningococcal 
disease include neurologic sequelae, 
limb amputation, and death. 
13, 
 
14 The 
case/fatality ratio of meningococcal 
disease ranges from 10% to 
40%. 
15 Although the incidence of 
meningococcal disease has been 
declining, outbreaks do still occur.16 
Adolescents and their families should 
be informed about the threat of 
infection and its complications.
Two polysaccharide-protein 
conjugate vaccines are currently 
licensed and recommended as 
part of the routine immunization 
schedule for the prevention of 
meningococcal disease in US 
adolescents: MenACWY-D (Menactra 
[Sanofi Pasteur, Swiftwater, PA]) 
and MenACWY-CRM (Menveo 
[Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, 
Cambridge, MA]). Both vaccines 
provide protection against 
meningococcal serogroups A, C, 
W, and Y. These vaccines also are 
indicated for groups at increased risk 
(ie, those with asplenia, complement 
deficiencies, or travel to an area 
where meningococcal disease is 
prevalent). There is no preferential 
recommendation for one MenACWY 
over the other.
In 2005, the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommended immunization 
against meningococcal disease with 
a MenACWY conjugate vaccine for 
individuals 11 through 12 years of 
age, primarily because the increased 
incidence of disease begins in late 
adolescence. In August 2011, the 
CDC recommended a booster dose 
of meningococcal vaccine 5 years 
after primary immunization for all 
adolescents because of serologic 
evidence of waning immunity and 
several cases of breakthrough 
disease.
Concurrent administration of 
meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-
CRM) with Tdap and quadrivalent 
HPV vaccine (4vHPV) yielded similar 
immune responses when compared 
with the response of each individual 
vaccine given independently. There 
also was no increase in adverse 
effects when all 3 vaccines were 
administered together. 
17 Similar 
results have been found for the 
9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV). 
18 This 
finding has important implications 
in the clinical setting, encouraging 
simultaneous administration of these 
3 vaccines during the same office 
visit and thereby increasing timely 
protection of adolescents against 
these vaccine-preventable diseases.
With the use of MenACWY vaccines 
in adolescents and young adults, 
serogroup B now causes 40% of 
all meningococcal disease cases 
in this age group. Most children 
survive serogroup B meningococcal 
disease without major sequelae. 
However, approximately one-tenth 
have major disabling deficits, and 
more than one-third have 1 or more 
deficits in physical, cognitive, and 
psychological functioning, with 
the additional burden of memory 
deficits and executive function 
problems. 
19 In recent years, ∼50 
cases of serogroup B meningococcal 
disease have occurred annually 
among 11- through 23-year-olds. 
20 
Approximately one-third of cases of 
serogroup B meningococcal disease 
among 18- through 23-year-olds 
occur in college students, and there 
have been 10 university-based 
outbreaks attributable to this 
serogroup since 2008.

vaccines have been licensed in recent 
years, as described below.
During 2013 to 2014, outbreaks of 
serogroup B meningococcal disease 
occurred at 2 universities, with a 
combined 13 cases and 1 death 
reported. In response, vaccination 
campaigns were conducted at both 
universities using a MenB vaccine 
(Bexsero [Novartis Vaccines and 
Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA]), which 
at the time had been investigational 
in the United States 
22 but already had 
been licensed in Europe, Canada, and 
Australia. It is not known whether 
the available MenB vaccines reduce 
the number of secondary cases. 
23
Bexsero was licensed 
24 in the 
United States in January 2015 for 
use in individuals 10 through 25 
years of age. Trumenba (Wyeth 
Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary 
of Pfizer, Philadelphia, PA) was 
licensed 
25 in the United States 
for use in the same age group in 
October 2014. The ACIP currently 
recommends the use of either MenB 
vaccine for people 10 years and older 
at increased risk for meningococcal 
serogroup B disease, including 
people with persistent complement 
component deficiencies, people with 
anatomic or functional asplenia, 
people receiving eculizumab, 
microbiologists who work with 
Neisseria meningitidis, and people 
in outbreak settings. These MenB 
vaccines were approved under the 
surrogate marker of complement-
dependent killing of organisms 
by vaccine-induced antibodies. 
This surrogate marker has not 
been established with serum from 
persistent complement component-
deficient subjects, and it is unknown 
whether such people can expect 
protection. Bexsero is a 2-dose 
series administered 1 month apart; 
Trumenba is approved as a 3-dose 
series administered at 0, 2, and 6 
months and a 2-dose series given at 
0 and 6 months. 
26 Only the 3-dose 
series of Trumenba should be 
used for those at increased risk for 
meningococcal serogroup B disease 
or those for whom immediate 
protection is optimal, such as during 
an outbreak. Although there is no 
preference for one MenB vaccine over 
the other, the same product must be 
used to complete the series. In June 
2015, the ACIP made a Category B 
recommendation for use of MenB 
vaccines in 16- through 23-year-old 
individuals for short-term protection 
against meningococcal B serogroup 
strains. Bexsero or the 2-dose 
Trumenba series can be used. The 
preferred ages are 16 through 18 
years. A Category B recommendation 
indicates individual counseling and 
risk benefit evaluation that depends 
on health care provider judgment 
and patient preferences. It is covered 
by the Vaccines for Children (VFC) 
program and by insurance companies 
under the Patient Protection and 
Affordable Care Act (Pub L No. 
111-148 [2010]), with no patient 
out-of-pocket costs. International 
studies may be useful to consider 
when evaluating the Category B 
recommendation in the United States.
Acellular Pertussis Vaccines
There has been increased clinical 
recognition of pertussis and its 
associated morbidity and mortality 
over the past 30 years. Increased 
awareness, evolving diagnostics, 
 
27 
vaccine refusal, and, most 
importantly, a more rapidly waning 
immunity after vaccination with 
acellular products compared with 
whole-cell pertussis vaccines have 
contributed to the marked recent 
increase in pertussis cases in the 
United States. 
28 
– 
30 In 2015, 20 762 
cases of pertussis were reported 
among all ages, with 32% of these 
cases occurring in adolescents 11 to 
19 years of age and 9 reported infant 
deaths.31, 
 
32 The incidence of pertussis 
peaked in 2012, with ∼48 277 cases 
across all ages and 20 reported 
deaths attributable to pertussis. 
33
Adolescents serve as an important 
reservoir for pertussis and are 
known to transmit the infection to 
the most vulnerable population: 
young infants. 
28 In 2015, almost 7000 
cases of pertussis were reported in 
the population of adolescents 11 to 
19 years of age. 
32 Healthy People 
2020 has created a goal to have no 
more than 2000 cases of pertussis 
in adolescents by 2020. Although 
most of the deaths are among young 
infants, older people, including 
adolescents, experience considerable 
morbidity attributable to pertussis. 
Prolonged cough, paroxysms of 
cough, pneumonia, shortness 
of breath, a choking sensation, 
vomiting, rib fractures, and scleral 
hemorrhages can occur. Adolescents 
need to be vaccinated to reduce 
adolescent disease morbidity and to 
minimize transmission of the disease 
to infants.
Two Tdap products, Boostrix 
(GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle 
Park, NC) and Adacel (Sanofi 
Pasteur), were licensed in the United 
States in 2005 for use in adolescents 
to improve pertussis immunity. The 
ACIP recommended a single Tdap 
dose at ages 11 through 12 years, 
with catch-up vaccination at ages 13 
through 18 years. 
34 The Tdap booster 
is recommended regardless of the 
interval since the last immunization 
with a tetanus or diphtheria 
toxoid–containing vaccine. 
35 Tdap 
has also been recommended as a 
single dose for adults, replacing 1 
Td booster. 
36 Beginning in October 
2012, the ACIP recommended a 
dose of Tdap for every pregnant 
woman during each pregnancy, 
regardless of immunization history. 
37 
Tdap administration is preferred 
for pregnant women between 27 
and 36 weeks of gestation, with an 
emphasis on earlier weeks during 
this preferred period, to enable 
high titers of the antibody to cross 
the placenta to provide the longest 
duration of passive protection to the 
young infant. The available data do 
not suggest any increased risk or

HPV Vaccines
HPV can be transmitted with any 
genital-mucosal contact. The lifetime 
risk of acquiring an HPV infection 
is >80%. 
39 An estimated 79 million 
people in the United States are 
currently infected with HPV and 
approximately half of the 14 million 
new infections that occur each 
year are in 15- through 24-year-
old individuals. 
40, 
 
41 Just over 20% 
percent of a representative sample 
of the US population of 14- through 
19-year-old girls who self-obtained 
vaginal swabs were found to be 
colonized with high-risk (oncogenic) 
HPV types. 
42 High-risk HPV types 
are responsible for virtually all 
cases of cervical cancer and a 
large percentage of anogenital and 
oropharyngeal cancers in females 
and males.43, 
 
44 More than 26 000 
new cases of HPV-related cancers 
are diagnosed annually in the United 
States. With no vaccination among 
girls 12 years of age and younger, 
there would be an estimated 168 400 
lifetime cases of cervical cancer and 
54 100 cervical cancer deaths among 
this group. 
45 In fact, comparison of 
prevaccine (2003–2006) and vaccine 
era (2009–2012) HPV prevalence 
showed a 64% decrease in 4vHPV 
type prevalence among girls 14 
through 19 years of age and a 34% 
decrease among women 20 through 
24 years of age, highlighting the 
impact of the HPV vaccine. 
46
The HPV vaccine has been included 
in the annual schedule as a 3-dose 
series for girls since 2007 and for 
both boys and girls since 2011 at 
ages 11 through 12 years. As of 
October 2016, the ACIP has revised 
its recommended HPV schedule to be 
a 2-dose series for persons initiating 
the vaccine series from 9 through 
14 years of age. 
47 Until recently, 
2 HPV vaccines were available in 
the United States: bivalent human 
papillomavirus vaccine (2vHPV; 
Cervarix [GlaxoSmithKline]), which 
targets HPV types 16 and 18 and 
is licensed for use in females, and 
quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV; 
Gardasil [Merck & Co Inc, Whitehouse 
Station, NJ]), which protects against 
HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18 and 
is licensed for use in females and 
males. 
40 A 9-valent HPV vaccine 
(9vHPV; Gardasil-9 [Merck & Co 
Inc, Whitehouse Station, NJ]) was 
licensed in December 2014. All 
3 licensed HPV vaccines provide 
primary protection against cancers 
related to HPV types 16 and 18, 
which are responsible for ∼70% of 
HPV-related cancers in the United 
States. The 9vHPV vaccine includes 
coverage for the original 4 HPV types 
(6, 11, 16, and 18) in the quadrivalent 
vaccine and for the high-risk HPV 
types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58, which 
are responsible for an additional 14% 
of HPV-related cancers in women 
and 4% of HPV-related cancers in 
males in the United States. 
48 The 
4vHPV and 9vHPV vaccines also 
protect against types 6 and 11, which 
are responsible for 90% of genital 
warts. As of January 2017, the 9vHPV 
vaccine became the only available 
HPV vaccine in the United States.
The 9vHPV vaccine was initially 
licensed in December 2014 for use 
in females 9 through 26 years of age 
and males 9 through 15 years of age 
on the basis of trial results available 
at the time of Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) submission. 
To evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of 9vHPV, a randomized, controlled 
clinical study was conducted in the 
United States and internationally. 
49 
The 9vHPV was 97% effective in 
protecting against cervical, vulvar, 
and vaginal cancer precursor lesions 
related to the 5 additional types, 
and antibody response against 
the 4 types in the 4vHPV vaccine 
was noninferior. 
49 Additional data 
on males through age 26 years 
were submitted to the FDA, and in 
December 2015, 9vHPV was licensed 
for use for males through age 26 
years. 
50
A 2-dose HPV vaccine schedule 
has the potential to improve 
completion rates and reduce costs. 
Data on antibody responses and the 
effectiveness of 2 doses of 2vHPV 
and 4vHPV suggest that protection 
from a 2-dose regimen would be 
similar to that of a 3-dose series. In 
1 Canadian randomized clinical trial, 
520 girls aged 9 to 13 years were 
randomized to receive either 3 doses 
of 4vHPV at 0, 2, and 6 months or 2 
doses of 4vHPV at 0 and 6 months. 
Researchers found that antibody 
levels after the 2-dose schedule 
were noninferior to those after 
the 3 doses. They also found that 
antibody titers resulting from the 
2-dose and 3-dose schedules were 
still comparable 36 months after 
receiving the vaccine. 
51 Similarly, in 
a study with over 1500 participants, 
Iverson et al 
52 found that antibody 
concentrations achieved in a clinical 
trial after a 9vHPV 2-dose series 
administered at 0 and 6 or 12 months 
to 9- through 14-year-old girls and 
boys were noninferior compared 
with the currently licensed 3-dose 
series in 16- through 26-year-old 
females. The immune response with 
a 12-month interval between the 
2 doses was more robust than that 
measured when the interval was only 
6 months. Geometric mean antibody 
titers against all HPV types in the 
9vHPV vaccine were higher in the 
9- through 14-year-old age groups 
than in the 16- through 26-year-old 
women. 
52 Although these studies are 
being extended for 2 more years to 
evaluate antibody persistence, 
 
53 
current data suggesting stronger 
immune responses in younger 
individuals may result in routinely 
recommending HPV vaccination for 
individuals as young as 9 years of 
age. The FDA approved the 2-dose 
schedule for persons 9 through 14 
years of age on October 7, 2016, and 
the ACIP revised its recommendation 
on October 19, 2016 to vaccinate

with 2 doses of 9vHPV vaccine.47, 
 
50 
The second dose should be 
administered 6 to 12 months after 
the first. Recommendations for 
completion of the vaccination series 
depend on the individual’s age when 
the HPV vaccination was initiated. 
47 
For example, if the first dose is given 
at age 14 years, that individual only 
needs 1 more dose >6 months later 
to complete the series, regardless of 
when the second dose is given.
The rationale for administering 
the HPV vaccine routinely at the 
11- through 12-year-old visit is 
based on data from vaccine trials, 
epidemiologic studies of HPV 
infection, and sexual behavior as well 
as modeling studies of HPV infection 
in adolescents that indicate the 
greatest protection will be achieved 
by giving the vaccine before the 
adolescent becomes sexually active. 
There is remarkably high incidence of 
HPV infection after sexual initiation. 
The cumulative incidence of HPV 
infection was nearly 40% within the 
first 2 years after first having sexual 
intercourse among college women 
and almost 60% among college men, 
underscoring the importance of early 
immunization with all 3 HPV vaccine 
doses. 
54, 
 
55 Data reporting that ∼24% 
of adolescent boys and girls report 
having sexual intercourse by ninth 
grade and that 58.1% report having 
sex by 12th grade 
56 support targeting 
HPV vaccination at the 11- through 
12-year-old visit. Administration 
of either 2vHPV, 4vHPV, or 9vHPV 
leads to greater antibody responses 
in girls and boys 9 through 15 
years of age, compared with those 
in girls and boys 16- through 26 
years of age receiving the respective 
vaccine. 
57, 
58 Pre- and postlicensure 
studies also have demonstrated 
safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy 
for the 2vHPV, 4vHPV vaccines. 
Each vaccine is highly effective, 
providing type-specific protection 
against the included HPV types. 
59 
A recent long-term study of 4vHPV 
recipients conducted over a period 
of 8 years has demonstrated safety, 
immunogenicity, and effectiveness 
in both girls and boys 9 through 15 
years of age. 
60
Currently, the ACIP recommends 
routine vaccination with the HPV 
vaccine for individuals 11 through 12 
years of age. The vaccine is licensed 
for use in children beginning at age 
9 years, the age at which the World 
Health Organization recommends 
starting HPV immunization. In 
addition, the ACIP recommends 
HPV vaccination beginning at age 
9 years for children and youth 
with any history of sexual abuse or 
assault who have not initiated or 
completed the series. Girls and boys 
who are victims of sexual abuse 
or assault should receive the HPV 
vaccine through the recommended 
ages if they have not already been 
vaccinated. 
40 Vaccination is also 
recommended for 13- through 
26-year-old females and 13- through 
21-year-old males who have not 
been vaccinated previously or who 
have not completed the series. 
Persons who receive the first dose 
of the vaccine at 15 years of age 
or older, and persons who are 
immunocompromised, should 
complete a 3-dose schedule at 0, 
1 to 2, and 6 months. 
47 Males 22 
through 26 years of age also may 
receive the vaccine. Men who are 
immune suppressed, have HIV 
infection, or have sex with men 
should be vaccinated through age 26 
years. For transgender persons, HPV 
vaccination is recommended through 
26 years for those who were not 
adequately vaccinated previously. 
A series begun with 4vHPV can be 
completed with 9vHPV. A study on 
the cost-effectiveness of additional 
9vHPV vaccination (ie, receiving 
a full 9vHPV series after receiving 
a full 4vHPV series) suggests that 
additional 9vHPV vaccination is 
not as efficient as other vaccination 
strategies, such as primary 9vHPV 
vaccination. 
61 Regardless, if a 
decision is made to give 9vHPV to 
a person who previously received 
a 2vHPV or 4vHPV series, the 
2- or 3-dose regimen currently 
recommended for 9vHPV should be 
followed. 
40, 
48
Most female adolescents on 
commercial and Medicaid health 
plans are currently not receiving the 
recommended doses of HPV vaccine 
by 13 years of age. Medicaid plans 
have reported significantly higher 
rates of 3-dose HPV vaccine coverage 
compared with commercial plans, 
although the median of adolescent 
girls receiving 3 doses was only 
19%. 
62 According to the 2015 NIS–
Teen, just over half (63%) of girls 
ages 13 through 17 years received ≥1 
dose of HPV vaccine, and only 41.9% 
completed the series. The coverage is 
even more limited among boys of the 
same age range, with 49.8% having 
received ≥1 dose, and 28.1% having 
completed the series. Compared with 
non-Hispanic white adolescents or 
adolescents living at or above the 
federal poverty level, adolescents 
who are African American, Hispanic, 
American Indian/Alaska Native, or 
living below the federal poverty line 
have a higher rate of initiation of the 
HPV vaccine series. 
8
Health care provider 
recommendation and physician 
attitude play a major role in the 
decision to vaccinate against HPV. 
On the basis of 2011 NIS–Teen data, 
Rahman et al 
63 found that health 
care provider recommendation 
independently predicted HPV vaccine 
initiation and completion. A strong 
endorsement is more influential than 
a weak one. Parents prefer clear, 
unambiguous recommendations; 
offering the HPV vaccine without 
strongly recommending it appears 
to confuse and frustrate parents. 
One of the most powerful messages 
that health care providers can 
transmit is that vaccination against 
HPV is a critical strategy for cancer 
prevention. Hull et al 
64 demonstrated 
that mothers and adolescent 
daughters were more willing to

receive the HPV vaccine when it 
was recommended as a routine 
vaccine that prevents cancer. A 
study of the impact of maintenance-
of-certification participation on 
HPV vaccination rates revealed that 
captured opportunities increased 
after participating health care 
providers chose to focus on cancer 
prevention, to use consistent 
language, and to emphasize 
vaccination at acute visits. These 
physicians had a significant relative 
increase in captured opportunities 
compared with non–maintenance 
of certification participants for 
HPV dose 1 at preventive visits and 
for doses 1 and 2 at acute visits. 
65 
Mothers also stated that they were 
less skeptical of the HPV vaccine 
when it was recommended with 
other vaccines than when the 
vaccine was singled out. The “same 
way, same day” slogan of the CDC 
promotes the recommendation 
of HPV vaccine with Tdap and 
meningococcal vaccines, grouping the 
3 vaccines together to avoid singling 
the HPV vaccine out. 
66
Infl
 uenza Vaccines
Influenza causes annual outbreaks, 
the timing and severity of which are 
unpredictable. Both children with 
high-risk conditions and otherwise 
healthy children are hospitalized 
each year because of influenza. 
Many more require outpatient or 
emergency department evaluation 
and management of influenza. 
A study of influenza-associated deaths 
from 2004 to 2012 demonstrated 
that even healthy children are at 
risk for mortality attributable to 
influenza. 
67 During nonpandemic 
seasons since the 2003–2004 season, 
reported pediatric deaths have 
ranged from a low of 37 (2011–2012 
season) to a high of 171 (2012–2013 
season). Higher pediatric mortality 
was noted during the 2009–2010 
pandemic, with >344 pediatric deaths 
reported. 
68 From 2004 through 2012, 
influenza A virus has accounted for 
78% of pediatric influenza-associated 
deaths. 
67
In the 2015–2016 influenza season, 
there were 89 reported influenza-
associated pediatric deaths. 
69 
Twenty-two deaths occurred in 
adolescents 12 through 17 years of 
age (24.7% of all pediatric deaths). 
Approximately 60% of all pediatric 
deaths occurred in children and 
adolescents who did not have 
any underlying high-risk medical 
conditions (out of 68 with known 
medical history). 
69
Influenza immunization rates are 
much lower in older pediatric 
patients. On the basis of 2015–2016 
NIS influenza vaccine coverage 
data for children 6 months through 
17 years of age, only 46.8% of 
adolescents 13 through 17 years of 
age received the vaccine, the lowest 
uptake of all pediatric age groups. 
In comparison, 75.3% of infants 6 
through 23 months of age received the 
influenza vaccine in 2015 to 2016. 
69
Annual vaccination against influenza 
is recommended for individuals of all 
ages beginning at 6 months of age, 
with a specific emphasis on groups 
at higher risk for complications 
(eg, children <5 years, the elderly, 
pregnant women, and those who 
are immunocompromised). 
70 In 
addition, the Committee on Obstetric 
Practice of the American Congress 
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists 
recommends routine influenza 
vaccination of pregnant women. 
71
Although vaccine effectiveness 
varies and is unpredictable from 
year to year, protection against 
virologically confirmed influenza 
illness after immunization with the 
inactivated influenza vaccine in 
healthy children >2 years generally 
ranges between 50% and 60% or 
higher, depending on the closeness 
of vaccine strain match with the 
circulating strains. Given the 
unpredictable nature of influenza 
each season, the AAP currently 
recommends that any licensed 
and age-appropriate inactivated 
influenza vaccine available be used. 
In light of the evidence for poor 
effectiveness of quadrivalent live 
attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV4) 
documented during the past 3 
seasons, LAIV4 should not be used 
in any setting during the 2016–2017 
season. The interim recommendation 
that LAIV4 not be used in children 
will be reevaluated for future 
influenza seasons. Vaccination should 
not be delayed to obtain a specific 
product and can be simultaneously 
administered with another vaccine. 
72
Catch-up Immunization and 
Immunization in Special 
Circumstances
Adolescents also may require 
catch-up of certain immunizations, 
such as hepatitis B, hepatitis A, 
measles, mumps, rubella vaccine 
(MMR), and varicella. Health care 
providers may choose to test 
for antibody to hepatitis A and 
varicella before immunizing against 
these diseases. Those who are not 
immunized against hepatitis B should 
receive a 3-dose series. Alternatively, 
a 2-dose series (0, 4-6 months) of 
adult-formulation Recombivax HB 
is licensed for use in children aged 
11 through 15 years. Adolescents 
who have not been immunized 
against hepatitis A should receive 
the 2-dose series with a minimum 
interval of 6 months. In a 2009 study, 
the reported rate of adolescents 
receiving a 1-time dose of hepatitis 
A was only 42%. 
73 Adolescents born 
outside the United States in countries 
with a hepatitis B surface antigen 
(HBsAg) prevalence >2% (and those 
born to mothers born in countries 
with an HBsAg prevalence >8% who 
are not immunized at birth) should 
have documentation of negative 
HBsAg before immunization with 
hepatitis B vaccine. 
72, 
 
74 Adolescents 
who have not received the MMR 
vaccine as part of the routine 
schedule should receive a 2-dose 
series at 11 through 12 years of age. 
It is particularly important for all

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
adolescents to be up-to-date with the 
MMR vaccine series, given the recent 
measles outbreaks in 16 states. 
75 
Furthermore, measles remains a 
common disease in many parts of the 
world, and unvaccinated individuals 
are at risk for becoming infected 
when they travel internationally.76 
Adolescents who have not been 
routinely immunized against varicella 
should receive a 2-dose series. 
Among adolescents with no history of 
varicella, the national immunization 
rate in 2015 was 83% for receipt of at 
least 2 doses. 
8 Factors, such as having 
private insurance, frequent office 
visits, having received meningococcal 
or Tdap vaccines, higher maternal 
education, residence in a state with 
school entry requirements, and being 
of younger age, were associated 
with completion of varicella 
immunization. 
77
A full vaccine history should 
be reviewed in the context of 
risk factors and to be aware of 
whether additional vaccines 
may be needed. For example, an 
adolescent may require a vaccine 
not given universally (for example, 
pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
[PCV13] and pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine [PPSV23] 
in an adolescent with diabetes, 
nephrotic syndrome, or a cochlear 
implant) because of an increased risk 
for certain pathogens attributable 
to an altered immune response, 
anatomic abnormality, or travel.
UNDERSTANDING BARRIERS TO 
IMMUNIZATION
Overcoming barriers to immunization 
requires understanding the 
inherent challenges that exist in 
delivering vaccines to the adolescent 
population. One of the greatest 
challenges is health care provider 
recommendation, which often 
lacks consistency and urgency. 
Many health care providers do not 
universally recommend vaccines 
to eligible populations and do not 
offer concomitant vaccination with 
indicated vaccines during a single 
patient encounter. 
78 In a recent 
study of physicians’ perspectives 
on the HPV vaccine, only ∼60% of 
pediatricians and family physicians 
strongly recommend the HPV 
vaccine for 11- through 12-year-
old girls. 
79 Aligning the vaccine 
messages communicated by all 
office personnel is challenging but 
important (ie, staff should have 
training on the delivery of vaccine 
information). A recent randomized 
clinical trial with 29 pediatric and 
family practices in North Carolina 
found that practices trained in an 
"announcement" (or presumptive) 
delivery strategy had significant 
increase in HPV vaccination coverage 
for individuals 11 or 12 years of 
age when compared with control 
practices that did not receive any 
training. Similar significance was 
not found in practices trained in a 
"conversational" delivery strategy. 
80 
From the physician perspective, the 
barriers are infrequent adolescent 
well visits or follow-ups and a 
lack of awareness of the need for 
vaccines. 
81 The perception that the 
patient and parent lack interest is 
also a reported reason that affects 
delivery of immunizations and other 
clinical preventive health services.82 
Public and health care personnel 
have personal beliefs that also may 
influence vaccine delivery. In a 
qualitative meta-analysis of 14 years 
of influenza-related communications 
research by the CDC, public and some 
health care provider perceptions 
and beliefs were difficult and slow to 
change. 
83
A study by Freed et al 
84 reported 
that 11.5% of parents of adolescents 
refused immunization. The 
meningococcal vaccine was declined 
31.8% of the time and the HPV vaccine 
was declined 56.4% of the time. 
84 
The majority of parents who declined 
either of these vaccines believed that 
(1) their child was at low risk for 
acquiring the disease; (2) the risks for 
adverse effects were “too great”; (3) 
there was not enough research on the 
vaccine; and (4) the vaccine had not 
been on the market “long enough.” 
84 
The NIS–Teen 2008–2010 data 
support these findings, including the 
additional concern about the safety of 
the HPV vaccine. 
85 Table 1 provides 
an overview of parental perspectives 
on vaccines. Education about these 
vaccines will help parents to make 
informed decisions about vaccinating 
adolescents.
Other potential barriers to 
immunization are Internet and media 
sources that give misinformation 
about vaccines, especially vaccine 
safety. Education on the importance 
of immunizations, infection risk 
and consequences, and the need 
to overcome peer-pressure or 
fear of needles should be key 
focuses for adolescent patients.

Pediatricians provide some of the

recommendations for parents and 
are their most trusted source of 
information. 
87 
– 
89 Furthermore, 
parents and adolescents should make 
decisions together regarding vaccine 
acceptance. The health care provider 
should be able to answer parent and 
patient questions and concerns and 
should be able to discuss in detail the 
information in the pertinent vaccine 
information sheet (VIS).
Racial and ethnic disparities in 
health care, including immunization 
coverage, have been demonstrated 
in the literature. 
90 For example, 
a 2015 study found that HPV 
vaccination coverage was higher 
among non-Hispanic black and 
Hispanic males compared with non-
Hispanic white males. 
91 Differences 
in the reasons for not receiving 
an influenza vaccination also exist 
between racial and ethnic groups. 
Black parents were more likely 
to be concerned about their child 
getting influenza from the vaccine 
compared with white and other or 
multiple-race parents. 
92 Focusing on 
disparities and understanding the 
cultural needs of a given population 
will aid in boosting immunization 
coverage rates. 
93, 
94 Different forms 
of written communication may 
be more effective among certain 
subpopulations. For example, HPV 
vaccine–specific brochures were 
found to be effective in increasing 
HPV vaccination rates among 
Hispanic but not among black 
individuals. 
95 In a predominantly 
Hispanic population in Los Angeles, 
California, community support 
for immunization, especially HPV 
vaccine, strongly affects individual 
decisions whether to immunize. 
96 
In addition, outreach programs 
and immunization campaigns 
targeting patients have proven to 
be effective. For example, churches 
can be important sources of social 
support and health information 
in black communities. 
97 Using 
medical and nonmedical settings 
(eg, school-based settings) for 
vaccine administration also may help 
to increase vaccine awareness. 
98 
Frequent electronic communications, 
such as recall/reminders and 
electronic health record prompts, 
also are all strategies that can be 
used by health care providers to 
improve vaccination rates. Vaccine 
administrations of all vaccines and 
in any setting should be entered into 
the electronic systems.
Financial difficulties affect adolescent 
immunizations as well. HPV vaccines 
constitute the most expensive 
series currently included in the 
VFC program; private-sector prices 
are even higher. 
99 The CDC vaccine 
price list (www. 
cdc. 
gov/ 
vaccines/ 
programs/ 
vfc/ 
awardees/ 
vaccine- 
management/ 
price- 
list/ 
) reports 
the following prices of vaccines in 
the private sector: (1) $193.63 per 
dose for 9vHPV; (2) $113 to $120 
per dose of MenACWY; and (3) $38 
to $43 per dose of Tdap. 
100 The 
limited availability of in-network 
health care providers in some rural 
jurisdictions and the persistence of 
some grandfathered plans that are 
not required to follow the Affordable 
Care Act preventive care provisions 
represent the remaining barriers 
to access. 
99 It has been shown that 
federal- and state-funded vaccine 
programs assist in boosting rates of 
office visits for immunizations. 
101
Another potential barrier is having 
an adequate supply of all vaccines 
for each patient available in the 
office. Efforts to work with vaccine 
manufacturers and the VFC program 
to maintain an adequate inventory 
should be considered. Appropriate 
payment for health care providers 
also is crucial in having successful 
immunization programs. 
102 Practices 
need to be up-to-date on current 
coding, billing, and financing 
strategies. The AAP has resources 
on vaccine financing, ordering, and 
supply that help practices achieve 
healthy financial margins (www.

en- 
us/ 
advocacy- 
and- 
policy/

initiatives/

aspx). In addition, the 
AAP provides specific information on 
the proper coding to help optimize 
payments for vaccines (www.

advocacy- 
and- 
policy/

aspx).
Although barriers to adolescent 
immunizations exist for all vaccines, 
HPV vaccination presents a unique set 
of challenges. 
103 A 2009 study based 
in 2 clinics in a Hispanic community 
in Los Angeles, California with high 
cervical cancer rates was aimed 
at understanding barriers to and 
facilitators of HPV immunization. 
96 
Several parental concerns and 
misconceptions included (1) 
adolescents do not need vaccination; 
(2) vaccine programs like VFC were 
only for infants and young children; 
(3) the vaccine may increase sexual 
activity; (4) discomfort toward a new 
vaccine; and (5) the vaccine is not 
required for school.
Since the introduction of HPV vaccine, 
parental acceptance has evolved to 
become a notable challenge to the 
immunization of adolescents. The 
2010 National Health Survey explored 
reasons why parents opposed HPV 
immunization for their child. 
104 
Approximately 25% of parents stated 
that there was no need for the vaccine, 
19.3% stated concern over vaccine 
safety, and 16.6% stated they did not 
have sufficient knowledge about the 
vaccine. 
104 Other reasons include 
weak or lack of health care provider 
recommendation and concerns over 
the effect on adolescents’ sexual 
behavior.  
Table 2 summarizes the top 
reasons why parents did not vaccinate 
their child against HPV, on the basis 
of their gender.  
Table 3 lists barriers 
to HPV immunization from both 
health care provider and parental 
perspectives.
Several studies have focused on 
whether receipt of the HPV vaccine 
lowers inhibition for sexual activity. 
Data show that vaccine receipt 
does not alter sexual activity.

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
A retrospective cohort study that 
followed adolescent girls for 3 
years after immunization at ages 
11 through 12 years did not find 
any increase in seeking medical 
attention for outcomes related to 
sexual activity, including pregnancy, 
sexually transmitted infection testing 
or diagnosis, and contraceptive 
counseling. 
105 HPV immunization 
does not change the vaccine 
recipient’s sexual behavior, such as 
number of sexual partners or sexually 
transmitted infections. 
105 Although 
vaccination may not affect sexual 
behavior, Mather et al 
106 found that 
attitudes toward practicing safe 
sexual behaviors differed among 
vaccinated and unvaccinated women. 
Vaccinated women were found to 
have more positive attitudes about 
practicing safe sex. However, both 
vaccinated and unvaccinated women 
did not differ in their perceived 
vulnerability to cervical cancer and 
need for cervical cancer screening. 
106
Another prominent barrier specific 
to the completion of the HPV vaccine 
series used to be its 3-dose schedule. 
On the basis of 2014 NIS–Teen 
data, the CDC found 3-dose series 
completion rates among those who 
received ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine to 
be only 69.3% for girls and 57.8% 
for boys. 
107 Coverage with at least 1 
dose of HPV vaccine before 13 years 
of age could have reached 91.3% for 
girls born in 2000 if opportunities 
to administer the HPV vaccine when 
other vaccines were given had not 
been missed. 
10 Scheduling follow-up 
visits for the second and third doses 
at the time the initial dose is given, 
implementing standing orders for 
vaccination, using every clinical 
opportunity to evaluate and deliver 
remaining vaccination doses, using 
electronic communication, and using 
recall/reminders are all strategies 
that can be used by health care 
providers to improve completion 
rates. More data are needed to 
understand the impact of the recently 
recommended 2-dose schedule.
Reasons that encouraged parents to 
accept HPV immunization include 
(1) family history of cervical cancer 
or HPV infection; (2) family and 
community support; (3) education 
on HPV vaccine; and (4) health care 
provider access to an immunization 
registry. Parents who reported 
Internet use to acquire health 
information, including on HPV, had 
significantly better knowledge, 
had fewer concerns about vaccine 
safety, and were more likely to 
accept HPV immunization. 
108 Health 
care provider knowledge about the 
HPV vaccine and promotion of the 
vaccine as a “routine” vaccine is also 
an important factor in encouraging 
parents to get their children 
vaccinated. 
96 The impact of health 
care provider promotion is illustrated 
by data that noted the reason why 
parents chose not to immunize 
their sons against HPV was that no 
physician or health care provider 
recommendation for the vaccine was 
given. 
109 In another study, ∼55% of 
parents who received a physician’s 
recommendation for HPV vaccination 
had their sons vaccinated versus 
only 1% of parents who did not 
receive a recommendation. 
110 Not 
surprisingly, health care provider 
recommendation was found to be the 
strongest predictor of HPV vaccine 
initiation.111
CONCLUSIONS
This clinical report highlights each of 
the vaccines routinely recommended 
for the healthy adolescent and 
summarizes the barriers that should 
be confronted to improve overall 
rates of immunization, which fall 
short of the Healthy People 2020 
goals. It is essential to continue to 
focus and refine the appropriate 
techniques in approaching the 
adolescent patient and parent in the
