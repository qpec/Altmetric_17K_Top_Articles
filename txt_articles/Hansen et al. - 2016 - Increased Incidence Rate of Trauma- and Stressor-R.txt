The terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001 (hereafter referred to as 9/11) in the United States
had a profound impact on the physical and mental health of Americans, but the effects beyond the United
States are largely unknown. To understand the wider aftermath, we examined the consequences of the 9/11 at-
tacks on mental disorders in the Kingdom of Denmark. Utilizing population data from the Danish Psychiatric
Central Research Register from 1995 to 2012, we used a time-series intervention approach to estimate the
change in the incidence rate of mental disorders after the 9/11 attacks. Based on analyses of 1,448,250 con-
tacts with psychiatric services, we found that the attacks were followed by an immediate 16% increase in the
incidence rate of trauma- and stressor-related disorders. This surge dissipated approximately a year after 9/11.
In contrast, no similar increases were found for other disorders. This is consistent with the prominent role of
external stressors in the etiology of trauma- and stressor-related disorders. The results indicate that the effects
of 9/11 on mental disorders extended across the Atlantic Ocean to Denmark. Thus, the impact of terrorist at-
tacks on mental health is likely not limited to inhabitants of the country under attack; it also extends to people far
away and without immediate relation to it.

The September 11, 2001 (hereafter referred to as 9/11)
terrorist attacks in the United States had a profound impact
on the physical and mental health of Americans (1). The
most severely affected were those directly exposed to the
attacks, along with the people working to ameliorate their
immediate consequences, such as, firefighters and rescue
and recovery workers assisting at the World Trade Center
site (2–6). However, the negative health effects of the at-
tacks were not limited to persons in direct contact with
them or their immediate aftermath. Increased prevalences
of symptoms of posttraumatic stress and other forms of
psychological distress were observed in the general US
population in the months after 9/11 (7, 8). Furthermore,
Americans who were exposed to more television coverage
of the attacks displayed significantly more symptoms of
posttraumatic stress 2–3 years afterward (9).
These findings suggest that in addition to persons directly
affected, those who vicariously experience traumatic events
can also have stress reactions. Yet, apart from the effects of
the 9/11 attacks on Americans themselves and similar effects
observed in other countries targeted by terrorism (10–13),
little is known about whether the psychological conse-
quences of vicariously experiencing terrorism extend even
further in a geographic sense. More specifically, it is un-
derexplored whether the adverse consequences of the 9/11
attacks and similar major terrorist attacks on mental health
extend across borders to other countries not directly affected
by the attack. In previous studies of the extra-national conse-
quences of the 9/11 attacks, investigators reported a drop in
self-reported well-being in the United Kingdom (14) and an
increase in posttraumatic stress disorders among the elderly
in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (15); however, in a third
study, investigators did not find any consequences for men-
tal health in Zurich, Switzerland (16). The latter 2 studies
used small sample sizes and/or studied a short time series,
so it remains largely unknown whether spillover effects
across countries actually exist. The existence of such
effects would indicate that the adverse consequences of
terrorism are much greater than assumed based on analy-
ses focused only on the countries targeted in the attacks.

 Furthermore, if the effect of terrorism on mental disorders
extends beyond borders, it would have implications for how
and to what extent psychiatric services in countries not
directly affected by an attack should respond to such events
in the future.
To address this gap in previous research, we analyzed
the post-9/11 trends in the incidence rates of mental disor-
ders in the Kingdom of Denmark, a country far removed
from the location of the attacks. Given the importance of
external stressors in the etiology of stress-related disorders
such as posttraumatic stress disorder (17, 18), as well as
previous findings from countries targeted by terrorism (10–
13), we hypothesized that there would be an increased
prevalence of trauma- and stressor-related disorders but not
of other mental disorders.
METHODS
Study design and participants
In the present study, we used data for the entire Danish
population from the Danish Psychiatric Central Research
Register (19), which has been used extensively for research
purposes (20). The Danish Psychiatric Central Research
Register contains data on all patient contacts with psychiat-
ric inpatient, outpatient, and emergency room services from
1995 onward for all individuals residing in or visiting the
Kingdom of Denmark (Denmark, Greenland, and The Faroe
Islands) (19). For each contact, a primary diagnosis is as-
signed by the treating psychiatrist. We used the Danish
Psychiatric Central Research Register data from January 1,
1995, to December 31, 2012, and based our analyses on pri-
mary diagnoses assigned after acute contacts with psychiat-
ric services. We excluded all contacts that were labeled as
“non-acute” or of “unknown status” (no information on
whether the contact was acute or planned), as well as all out-
patient contacts. These were excluded because an increase
in preplanned contacts could not be due to an unexpected
event like the 9/11 attacks, and therefore including these
contacts could not contribute any information to the analy-
sis. The study was approved by the Danish Data Protection
Agency, the State Serum Institute, and Statistics Denmark.
Measures and procedures
The primary outcome of our analysis was the diagnostic
category for which an effect of the 9/11 attacks was ex-
pected, namely “reaction to severe stress, and adjustment
disorders” (International Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision, code F43 (17)), which we will refer to as “trauma-
and stressor-related disorders.” In addition, we also examined
each of the following aggregate diagnostic categories from
the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision:
mental and behavioral disorders due to psychoactive sub-
stance use (codes F10–F19), schizophrenia, schizotypal, and
delusional disorders (codes F20–F29), mood disorders (codes
F30–F39), and anxiety, neurotic, and somatoform disorders
(codes F40–F48, excluding code F43) (17). Finally, we ana-
lyzed all acute contacts with psychiatric hospitals irrespective
of diagnosis. We included these other categories in order to
provide a stronger falsification test of our main hypothesis.
Because external stressors feature in the diagnostic criteria
for (and etiology of) trauma- and stressor-related disorders,
we would expect a stressful event such as the 9/11 attacks
to primarily have an effect on these types of disorders.
Therefore, if we found similar increases in the incidence of
other mental disorders for which stressful events have been
less implicated in the etiology, it would call into question
the specific explanation advanced (i.e., the 9/11 attacks
being a stressful event) and instead indicate that other devel-
opments might have triggered a general deterioration of
mental health. Conversely, if we observed an increase for
only trauma- and stressor-related disorders, this would ce-
teris paribus be an indication that the acute psychological
stress associated with the 9/11 attacks, rather than other
influences, did in fact trigger the increase.
Statistical analysis
Using the full data set from the Danish Psychiatric
Central Research Register from 1995 to 2012, we gener-
ated a time series that counted the total number of daily
acute contacts and partitioned this into separate time series
for the number of daily contacts, resulting in a primary
diagnosis from each of the diagnostic categories outlined
above. We then aggregated these observations to the weekly
level to reduce noise and facilitate prediction. After aggrega-
tion, each observation consisted of the average daily number
of contacts or diagnoses in a given week (hereafter referred
to as the incidence rate). This resulted in 940 weekly obser-
vations of incidence rates that were constructed such that
each week began on a Wednesday, ensuring that the first
postintervention week would begin immediately after the
Tuesday of the attacks. To stabilize the variance of the time
series, we transformed the weekly numbers of average daily
contacts using the natural logarithm. We then conducted the
intervention analysis using Tuesday, September 11, 2001, as
the intervention date.
The analysis followed the transfer function approach
described by Cryer and Chan (21) and originally introduced
by Box and Tiao (22). The core idea in the intervention analy-
sis of Box and Tiao is to think of the time series in question
as consisting of 2 parts: One is the natural or unperturbed pro-
cess, which represents how the time series progresses in the
absence of an intervention, and the other is the perturbed pro-
cess, which represents the progress of the time series after the
intervention has acted upon it. The unperturbed process can
be thought of as our counterfactual, and the first step of the
analysis is to model it statistically through a standard Box-
Jenkins autoregressive integrated moving average approach
(23). If the timing of the intervention is exogenous to the time
series itself—that is, if the incident rates of mental disorders
in Denmark were not substantially affected by factors that
determined the timing of the 9/11 attacks and if the incidents
rates themselves did not affect that timing—then the part of
the time series observed before the intervention can be used
to obtain an unbiased estimate of this counterfactual, which
we can then compare to the observed postattack development
by means of a transfer function. Such quasi-experimental con-
ditions were likely present in this context because the 9/11

 attacks were sudden and unanticipated, and their causes were
completely unrelated to the level of mental disorders in
Denmark (14). Moreover, the attacks did not coincide with
other major events in Denmark (or the nearby countries) that
could plausibly lead to population-wide mental health
deterioration.
Following the procedure by Box and Tiao described

Figures 1–3 (available at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/), we
refer to W as a moving average term of order 0 and to B1m
as an autoregressive term of order 1. The coefficient of the
former gives the immediate change in the incidence rates
after the 9/11 attacks and the coefficient of the latter gives
the decay in this change over time. To account for a delay
in the onset of the increase, we lagged W 1 period in the
main specification. Because the different series have differ-
ent temporal dynamics, modeling the unperturbed series re-
quires different numbers of autoregressive and moving
average terms. These are given by the scalars p and q in
the second column of Table 1.
Having completed the Box and Tiao procedure, we
performed a series of “placebo” tests for trauma- and
stressor-related disorders. These tests involved estimating
the intervention model used in the main analysis but doing so
with the intervention time moved to a number of different
dates, each a multiple of 50 weeks from the actual 9/11 at-
tacks. The logic behind this was simply that if the estimated
change right after 9/11 was indeed a consequence of the at-
tacks, we should not be able to estimate a similar change at a
large number of other unrelated dates. These tests are
described in detail in Web Appendix 1 and Web Figures 1–3.
RESULTS
Between 1995 and 2012, a total of 2,719,311 contacts
were made to Danish psychiatric hospital services. Of
these, 1,271,061 were designated as non-acute, of unknown
status, or as outpatient, leaving the time series used in the
analysis with a total of 1,448,250 contacts. Of these acute
contacts, 159,618 resulted in a primary diagnosis of a
trauma- and stressor-related disorder. Table 1 shows the re-
sults of our analysis of the development in the incidence
rates of the different mental disorders after the 9/11 attacks
using the entire 940-week time series.
The results clearly support our hypothesis: The moving
average term showed a significant and immediate increase in
the number of daily trauma- and stressor-related disorders
after 9/11, and the autoregressive term showed that this
spike gradually decayed back toward its baseline. In con-
trast, no significant changes were found for acute contacts in
general or for any of the aggregate diagnostic categories.
This differential development in the various disorders is
clearly evident from Figures 1 and 2, in which we plotted

 the actual and the predicted incidence rates around the 9/11
terrorist attacks.
Figure 1 shows a marked “overincidence” of trauma- and
stressor-related disorders immediately after the 9/11 attacks
compared with the estimate of how the series would have
progressed if no intervention had occurred. Further, it shows
that this increase was well captured by the specified transfer
function. Conversely, the incidence rates of the remaining
diagnostic categories show no systematic divergence from
the estimated counterfactual. In substantive terms, our results
indicate that the 9/11 attacks were followed by a 16%
increase in the incidence rate of trauma- and stressor-related
disorders in the week immediately after the week of the
attack (the time series is transformed by the natural loga-
rithm, so a coefficient of 0.148 translates into a 16%
change). This spike decayed quite slowly. The coefficient on
the autoregressive term from Table 1 indicates that approxi-
mately 95% of the 16% increase persisted into the following
week and that in the week after that, 95% of these 95% re-
mained, and so on. This gradual decay continued until the
series was back to the value seen at the outset.
Figure 3 shows that half a year after the 9/11 attacks, the
incidence rate of trauma- and stressor-related disorders was
still elevated to approximately 5% above the predicted
level and that it only returned to normal more than a year
after the attacks. The results of the placebo tests are re-
ported in Web Figures 1–3. The tests all found that the
intervention model used above did not estimate significant
increases for a large number of other unrelated dates. In
fact, the models reported a significant and positive change
in the number of trauma- and stressor-related disorders at
only a single point other than 9/11 out of 15 unrelated
dates. This strongly supports the interpretation that the
estimated increase in stress-related disorders was indeed
caused by the 9/11 attacks and was not merely an artifact
of random noise in the time series.
DISCUSSION
Using a transfer function time series intervention analy-
sis, we examined whether the adverse consequences of the
9/11 attacks on mental health extended beyond those previ-
ously documented in the United States. Specifically, we
analyzed the development of mental disorders in Denmark
after the 9/11 attacks. Using population data on diagnoses

Using a time window of approximately 1 year before and after the

ated a plot showing the observed number of trauma- and stressor-
related disorders (dashed line) along with predictions from both the
transfer function model (solid line) and a pure autoregressive inte-
grated moving average model (large dotted line). Up until the first
week after 9/11 (week = 0), the predictions are 1-step, meaning that
the models used data from all relevant previous periods when pre-
dicting the value of the series in a given period. After 9/11, the pre-
dictions become dynamic and are thus based solely on data from
before 9/11 and the parameters of the transfer function.

 assigned by psychiatric hospital services from 1995 to
2012, we showed that the 9/11 attacks were followed by a
significant and substantial increase in the incidence rate of
trauma- and stressor-related disorders. The weeks immedi-
ately after the attack saw a growth in trauma- and stressor-
related disorders of approximately 16%. Additionally, the
elevated incidence rate was not confined to a brief period
after the attacks; it persisted for a prolonged period. After
half a year, it remained 5% above the expected level, and it
did not return to normal until more than a year after the
attack. We found no significant increases for any of the
other diagnostic categories studied or for acute contacts in
general.
This
differential
trajectory
corroborated
our
hypothesis that the acute severe stress associated with the
attacks would trigger trauma- and stressor-related disorders
but not other forms of disorders for which such stress does
not constitute a similarly essential part of the etiology
and diagnostic criteria (17). Because of the longitudinal
population-based diagnostic data, the quasi-experimental
nature of the 9/11 intervention, and the negative results of
the placebo tests, we believe the present study provides
strong evidence that the 9/11 attacks were causally linked
to the increase in the incidence rate of trauma- and stressor-
related disorders in Denmark.
These results are in line with those of van Zelst et al.
(15), who report increased rates of posttraumatic stress dis-
order symptoms among the elderly in Amsterdam, but they
are in stark contrast to the results of Haker et al. (16).
Using admissions data from psychiatric hospitals in the
Swiss canton of Zurich, Haker et al. found no increase in
the incidence rate of any of the diagnostic categories they
investigated after the 9/11 attacks. There are several plausi-
ble explanations for the differences in the results. For
instance, Haker et al. used a much shorter time series than
we did (2 as opposed to 18 years), which impeded the esti-
mation of both the unperturbed time series and any pro-
longed intervention effects, and they did not distinguish
between trauma- and stressor-related disorders and neurotic
or somatoform disorders. Furthermore, their analysis might
have been confounded by the fact that a local terrorist
attack occurred in the capital of a neighboring canton just 2
weeks after 9/11. It appears that both the 9/11 attacks and
the subsequent local attack were not included in the same
model, which is likely to have biased the estimate of the
former downward because the week after 9/11 was then
compared with weeks “contaminated” by the other attack.
Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Haker et al. did not
model the effects of either intervention beyond the actual
intervention week. The strongly significant, long-lasting
increase found in our study indicates that the transfer func-
tion of order (0, 0) used by Haker et al. (16) might not be
an ideal model for studying the consequences of the 9/11
attacks.
This long-lasting increase in trauma- and stressor-related
disorders may be due to a latency period after the trauma,
which is characteristic for posttraumatic stress disorder
(contained in the category of trauma- and stressor-related
disorders) (17). However, an alternative explanation for this
persistence of the original increase is a “kindling” effect, in
which an initial negative reaction to a trauma sensitizes the
individual to subsequent traumas (23–25). Disentangling
the relative merits of these 2 explanations for the extended
consequences of the 9/11 attacks—and other traumatizing
events—would clearly be a topic for future research.
The deterioration in extra-national mental health after
the 9/11 attacks detected in the present study implies that
acts of terrorism are likely to have much wider conse-
quences than previously indicated by analyses of mental
health within the targeted countries. Although we may
expect a stronger impact in the population of the country
directly targeted in the attack, the sheer size of the extra-
national public potentially affected by the attack would
drastically increase the psychological consequences if our
analysis from Denmark is generalizable. The extra-national
character of the post-9/11 deterioration of mental health
observed in this study also highlights the pronounced
importance of mass media in transmitting stress-inducing
information to populations in countries far removed from
the target of the attack (see Garfin et al. (25) for a study of
the role of media exposure in the United States). This sadly
confirms that one of the alleged purposes of (certain types
of) terrorism—to generate mass-scale attention and intimi-
dation—is in fact achieved. Although this remains to be
examined, it seems likely that such an effect would become
even stronger in the future, given the highly visual and
real-time nature of today’s mass media.
Although we believe that our study has provided strong
evidence that the 9/11 attacks were causally linked to an
increase in the incidence of trauma- and stressor-related
disorders in Denmark, it contains a number of limitations.
First, only psychiatric hospitals, not private practicing

 psychiatrists or general practitioners, report to the Danish
Psychiatric Central Research Register. This means that our
results are only representative of the more severe cases
of psychopathology and that we cannot know whether the
9/11 attacks were followed by a similar deterioration in
mental health for the less severely affected, although this
would seem probable.
Second, the diagnoses of trauma- and stressor-related
disorders are, to some extent, based on self-reporting of
distressing symptoms, which are evaluated by a psychia-
trist. This raises the fundamental problem of the apparent
effect on these disorders potentially being confounded by
its measurement. This could work in 2 ways. First, in the
wake of a terrorist attack, individuals might display an
increased awareness of and sensitivity to symptoms of
stress, which would lead them to report these symptoms to
psychiatric services more frequently. Second, psychiatrists
themselves could in principle also be sensitized to symp-
toms of stress-related disorders, especially because external
stressors (including experiences of traumatic events) fea-
ture in the diagnostic criteria for (and etiology of) trauma-
and stressor-related disorders. Primed by this knowledge,
psychiatrists may be more likely to assign diagnoses of
trauma- and stressor-related disorders. Both scenarios imply
that the observed increase in trauma- and stressor-related dis-
orders reflects processes related to their diagnosis rather than
an actual deterioration of mental health. This issue of mea-
surement error could call into question our interpretation of
the results, but at the same time it should also apply to the
field at large, and therefore devising a solution to this chal-
lenge remains a more general endeavor.
Third and finally, we only studied the consequences of
one, arguably quite unique, act of terrorism (9/11) in one
extra-national context (Denmark). This raises the question
of the external validity of the findings. Does the increase in
trauma- and stressor-related disorders observed in the wake
of the 9/11 attacks generalize to other contexts and other
attacks? As for the geographical extension of the observed
health sequelae, we have no a priori reason to believe that
Danes should be particularly sensitive to extra-national ter-
rorism and that our results would therefore not apply to
other countries. However, one hypothesis may be that
extra-national terrorism has particularly dire consequences
in countries geographically and culturally similar to the
country being targeted by terrorism. This would, for exam-
ple, imply more severe consequences of the 9/11 attacks
for mental health in Canada. Were the 9/11 attacks special?
The incident has been said to mark the beginning of mod-
ern large-scale Islamic terrorism in Western countries (26),
and perhaps the novel character of 9/11 or the extensive
media attention it received sparked a particularly pronounced
negative psychological reaction abroad. Conversely, it could
also be hypothesized that subsequent attacks—for example,
the 2004 attacks in Madrid, Spain (13) or the 2005 attacks
in London, United Kingdom (10, 11), which also received
massive attention in mass media—worked in conjunction
with 9/11 to exercise a multiplicative effect on mental disor-
ders (23, 27). Indeed, this seems likely based on research
indicating “that the accumulation of prior indirect exposure
may sensitize individuals to subsequent traumas regardless
of event proximity” (25, p. 681). Interestingly, consistent
with both the “proximity-conditioning” and the “sensitiza-
tion” hypotheses, we found in a separate study (B.T.H.,
P.T.D., K.M.S., and S.D.Ø., unpublished data, 2016) that
the 2011 Breivik attacks in Norway (28) (geographically
and culturally very proximate to Denmark) were followed
by a similar but substantially larger and more prolonged
increase in the incidence rate of trauma- and stressor-related
disorders in Denmark. Future studies in which multiple acts
of terrorism in a range of extra-national contexts are exam-
ined would be very valuable for parsing out the contingen-
cies of the extra-national consequences of terrorism.
Lastly, if the increased incidence of trauma- and stressor-
related disorders detected in this study represents a causal
effect of 9/11, it would seem important for psychiatric ser-
vices to plan routines to mitigate the mental health conse-
quences of future extra-national terrorist attacks, by, for
example, setting up telephone hotlines and calling in extra
staff to man the psychiatric emergency rooms. To our
knowledge, no countries have established such routines in
clinical practice.
