BACKGROUND
Glecaprevir and pibrentasvir are direct-acting antiviral agents with pangenotypic 
activity and a high barrier to resistance. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
8-week and 12-week courses of treatment with 300 mg of glecaprevir plus 120 mg 
of pibrentasvir in patients without cirrhosis who had hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
genotype 1 or 3 infection.
METHODS
We conducted two phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter trials. Patients 
with genotype 1 infection were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive once-
daily glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for either 8 or 12 weeks. Patients with genotype 3 
infection were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive 12 weeks of treatment 
with either glecaprevir–pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir–daclatasvir. Additional patients 
with genotype 3 infection were subsequently enrolled and nonrandomly assigned to 
receive 8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir. The primary end point 
was the rate of sustained virologic response 12 weeks after the end of treatment.
RESULTS
In total, 1208 patients were treated. The rate of sustained virologic response at 12 
weeks among genotype 1–infected patients was 99.1% (95% confidence interval 
[CI], 98 to 100) in the 8-week group and 99.7% (95% CI, 99 to 100) in the 12-week 
group. Genotype 3–infected patients who were treated for 12 weeks had a rate of 
sustained virologic response at 12 weeks of 95% (95% CI, 93 to 98; 222 of 233 
patients) with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir and 97% (95% CI, 93 to 99.9; 111 of 115) 
with sofosbuvir–daclatasvir; 8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
yielded a rate of 95% (95% CI, 91 to 98; 149 of 157 patients). Adverse events led 
to discontinuation of treatment in no more than 1% of patients in any treatment 
group.
CONCLUSIONS
Once-daily treatment with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for either 8 weeks or 12 
weeks achieved high rates of sustained virologic response among patients with 
HCV genotype 1 or 3 infection who did not have cirrhosis. (Funded by AbbVie;

Glecaprevir–Pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in HCV
H
epatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes 1 
and 3 are together responsible for ap-
proximately 70% of an estimated 71 
million to 80 million HCV infections world-
wide.1,2 Direct-acting antiviral agents have be-
come the standard-of-care treatment for chronic 
HCV infection and show high rates of sustained 
virologic response in most HCV genotypes.3 The 
efficacy of approved, direct-acting antiviral regi-
mens with 12-week treatment durations ranges 
from 94 to 99% among patients with HCV geno-
type 1 infection.4-7 An 8-week course of treat-
ment with sofosbuvir–ledipasvir may be consid-
ered for patients with genotype 1 infection who 
do not have cirrhosis and who have not previ-
ously received HCV treatment; however, treatment 
is restricted according to baseline viral load and 
fibrosis stage.8,9 For patients with HCV genotype 
3 infection who do not have cirrhosis and have 
not previously received treatment, the standard 
of care is a 12-week course of sofosbuvir plus 
either daclatasvir10 or velpatasvir5; both regimens 
have yielded an overall rate of sustained viro-
logic response of 98% at 12 weeks after treat-
ment.11,12 Most approved regimens recommend 
12 weeks of treatment for patients with HCV 
infection; however, patient adherence can de-
cline during the last 4 weeks of treatment, which 
suggests that shorter treatment durations may 
improve adherence.13 Furthermore, a reduced-
duration HCV regimen with pangenotypic activ-
ity that maintains high efficacy regardless of the 
characteristics of the patient or of the virus may 
increase the number of treated patients, espe-
cially in resource-limited settings.14
Glecaprevir is a nonstructural (NS) protein 
3/4A protease inhibitor that was identified by 
AbbVie and Enanta; it is coformulated with pi-
brentasvir, an NS5A inhibitor. The in vitro half-
maximal effective concentrations of glecaprevir 
and pibrentasvir range from 0.85 to 2.8 nmol 
per liter and 1 to 5 pmol per liter, respectively, 
across HCV genotypes 1 through 6. Together, 
these direct-acting antivirals have pangenotypic, 
synergistic anti-HCV activity with a high barrier 
to resistance, minimal metabolism, primarily bili-
ary excretion, and negligible renal excretion.15,16 
Phase 2 trials of glecaprevir (300 mg) plus pi-
brentasvir (120 mg) for 8 or 12 weeks in patients 
without cirrhosis who were infected with HCV 
genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 showed rates of sus-
tained virologic response of more than 93% at 
12 weeks after treatment, including a rate of 
97% among patients with genotype 1 or 3 infec-
tion who were treated for 8 weeks.17
In ENDURANCE-1 (A Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of ABT-493/ABT-530 in Sub-
jects with Genotype 1 Infection), which involved 
HCV genotype 1–infected patients, including 
those with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
[HIV-1] coinfection, and ENDURANCE-3 (A Study 
Comparing Efficacy and Safety of ABT-493/ABT-
530 to Sofosbuvir Dosed With Daclatasvir in 
Adults With HCV Genotype 3 Infection), which 
involved HCV genotype 3–infected patients who 
had not previously received treatment for HCV 
infection, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
an 8-week or 12-week course of treatment with 
ribavirin-free, once-daily coformulated glecapre-
vir–pibrentasvir in patients without cirrhosis. In 
HCV genotype 3–infected patients, a 12-week 
course of treatment with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
was also compared with a 12-week course of 
treatment with sofosbuvir–daclatasvir.
Methods
Trial Design
We conducted two phase 3, open-label, multi-
center trials (Fig. 1). Patients in ENDURANCE-1 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 weeks. The 
treatment assignments were not concealed. Ran-
domization was computer-generated and strati-
fied according to screening plasma HCV RNA 
level and HCV genotype 1 subtype, which were 
considered potential prognostic factors.
ENDURANCE-3 had an active-controlled, par-
tially randomized design: patients were randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either glecaprevir–
pibrentasvir or 400 mg of sofosbuvir plus 60 mg 
of daclatasvir for 12 weeks. After additional 
phase 2 data that supported the efficacy of an 
8-week treatment duration became available, a sub-
sequent protocol amendment enabled the non-
random assignment of patients into a third group 
for 8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir–pibrent-
asvir. In both trials, glecaprevir–pibrentasvir was 
administered orally once daily as three tablets 
(each containing 100 mg of glecaprevir and 40 mg 
of pibrentasvir), for a total daily dose of 300 mg of 
glecaprevir and 120 mg of pibrentasvir.

Glecaprevir–Pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in HCV
Trial Oversight
All the patients provided written informed con-
sent. The trials were designed in accordance with 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration 
of Helsinki, and applicable local regulations, with 
approval from an independent ethics committee 
or institutional review board for all trial sites. 
The sponsor (AbbVie) conducted the data analy-
ses, and the authors had full access to the data; 
the authors vouch for the accuracy and com-
pleteness of the data and for the fidelity of the 
trials to the protocols, which are available with 
the full text of this article at NEJM.org. The in-
vestigators, participating institutions, and spon-
sor agreed to maintain the confidentiality of the 
data. The first draft of the manuscript was gen-
erated by all the authors, with assistance from 
sponsor-employed medical writers.
Patients
Patients who were at least 18 years of age were 
eligible for participation in the trials if they had 
chronic HCV genotype 1 or 3 infection with an 
HCV RNA level higher than 1000 IU per milli-
liter at screening. Patients with HCV genotype 1 
infection could have HIV-1 coinfection and could 
either have never received HCV treatment or have 
received treatment with interferon or pegylated 
interferon with or without ribavirin or treatment 
with sofosbuvir plus ribavirin with or without 
pegylated interferon. Patients with genotype 3 
infection had to have never received HCV treat-
ment. The absence of cirrhosis in all patients was 
documented by means of liver biopsy, assessment 
of serum markers, or transient elastography. 
Patients who were positive for hepatitis B sur-
face antigen or coinfected with more than one 
HCV genotype were excluded. Detailed eligibility 
criteria are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix, available at NEJM.org.
Assessments
Plasma HCV RNA was quantified for each 
sample with the use of the COBAS Ampliprep/
TaqMan real-time reverse-transcriptase poly-
merase-chain-reaction assay, version 2.0 (Roche 
Molecular Diagnostics), which has a lower 
limit of quantification of 15 IU per milliliter. 
Next-generation sequencing was conducted on 
plasma samples collected from all patients at 
baseline, and the presence of polymorphisms 
in NS3 and NS5A at baseline was evaluated 
with the use of a 15% detection threshold. For 
patients who had virologic failure, substitu-
tions (relative to the patient’s baseline HCV 
sequence) that arose during treatment were 
analyzed (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Details on genotype and subtype determi-
nation, HCV resistance analysis, and monitor-
ing of HIV-1 suppression and of lymphocytes 
and lymphocyte subsets for HIV-1 coinfected 
patients are provided in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. Adverse events and clinical laboratory 
abnormalities were monitored throughout the 
trial, and safety analyses were performed in the 
intention-to-treat population.
Figure 1 (facing page). Trial Design and Patient 
 
Populations.
Panel A shows a diagrammatic summary of the trial 
design. ENDURANCE-1 included two treatment groups: 
patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to re-
ceive coformulated glecaprevir–pibrentasvir (300 mg 
of glecaprevir plus 120 mg of pibrentasvir) for either  
8 or 12 weeks. The numbers of treated patients in the 
intention-to-treat population, open-label treatment 
 
assignments, timing of the assessment of the rate  
of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (SVR12), 
and duration of post-treatment follow-up are shown. 
ENDURANCE-3 included two randomly assigned treat-
ment groups (12-week) and a third treatment group  
(8-week) that was nonrandomly sequentially enrolled 
after the 12-week groups had completed enrollment. 
Patients who were treated for 12 weeks received either 
coformulated glecaprevir–pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir 
(400 mg) plus daclatasvir (60 mg). Patients who were 
treated for 8 weeks received coformulated glecaprevir–
pibrentasvir. Panel B is an abbreviated flowchart show-
ing patient disposition for the patient populations in-
cluded in the statistical analyses for both trials. Of the 
352 patients with HCV genotype 1 who were randomly 
assigned to receive glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for 8 weeks, 
1 never received treatment, and of the 116 patients with 
HCV genotype 3 who were randomly assigned to receive 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for 12 weeks, 1 never received 
treatment; these 2 patients were not included in the 
 
intention-to-treat population. Figure S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix provides the full flowcharts for both 
trials.

End Points
The primary efficacy end point for both trials 
was sustained virologic response at week 12 
after treatment, defined as an HCV RNA level 
below 15 IU per milliliter 12 weeks after the last 
dose of trial drug without any confirmed quan-
tifiable post-treatment HCV RNA level through 
the post-treatment week 12 visit. A full list of the 
secondary efficacy end points is provided in 
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. Sec-
ondary end points included the percentage of 
patients with virologic failure during treatment 
(defined as a confirmed increase in HCV RNA 
level of >1 log10 IU per milliliter above the nadir 
during treatment, confirmed HCV RNA level 
≥100 IU per milliliter after the level had been 
<15 IU per milliliter during treatment, or an 
HCV RNA level ≥15 IU per milliliter at the end 
of treatment [with at least 6 weeks of treatment]) 
and post-treatment relapse (defined as a con-
firmed HCV RNA level ≥15 IU per milliliter be-
tween the end of treatment and 12 weeks after 
the last dose of trial drug among patients who 
both completed treatment and had an HCV RNA 
level of <15 IU per milliliter at the end of treat-
ment [excluding reinfection]).
Statistical Analyses
In ENDURANCE-1, a fixed-sequence testing pro-
cedure was used to conduct three sequentially 
ranked primary efficacy analyses in the primary 
subset of the intention-to-treat population, de-
fined as all patients who underwent randomiza-
tion and who received at least one dose of trial 
drug, excluding those who had HIV coinfection 
or who had previously received sofosbuvir treat-
ment. Only if success had been shown for the 
first primary analysis would the second primary 
analysis proceed, and only if success had been 
shown for the second primary analysis would 
the third primary analysis proceed. Under the as-
sumption of a rate of sustained virologic response 
of 97% at 12 weeks, we calculated that at least 
270 patients monoinfected with HCV genotype 1 
who had not received previous treatment with 
sofosbuvir would be required in each treatment 
group to provide more than 90% power for the 
analyses. The first-ranked primary efficacy analy-
sis was the analysis of the efficacy of the 12-week 
treatment duration, wherein the lower bound of 
the two-sided 95% confidence interval, calculated 
with the use of the normal approximation to the 
binomial distribution for the percentage of pa-
tients treated for 12 weeks who had a sustained 
virologic response at week 12, was compared 
with a threshold rate of 91%. The threshold was 
determined with the use of a 6-percentage-point 
margin, on the basis of the historical rate of 
sustained virologic response of 97% that has 
been observed among HCV genotype 1–infected, 
HCV monoinfected patients who had not previ-
ously received direct-acting antiviral treatment 
who were treated for 12 weeks.4,6
The second-ranked primary efficacy analysis 
was a noninferiority assessment of an 8-week 
treatment duration relative to a 12-week treatment 
duration with regard to the rate of sustained 
virologic response at 12 weeks. This analysis was 
conducted with the use of a noninferiority mar-
gin of 5 percentage points in the per-protocol 
population, which excluded patients in the pri-
mary subset who prematurely discontinued treat-
ment or had virologic failure before week 8 of 
treatment and patients without virologic failure 
for whom data on HCV RNA level during the 
window for assessment of sustained virologic re-
sponse at 12 weeks were missing. Since patients 
in both treatment groups received the same regi-
men during the first 8 weeks, treatment failure 
for any reason before week 8 could not be attrib-
uted to treatment duration and thus would not 
inform the noninferiority analysis. If the lower 
bound of the confidence interval (calculated with 
the use of the normal approximation to the bi-
nomial distribution) for the difference in rates of 
sustained virologic response at 12 weeks (i.e., 
the rate in the 8-week group minus the rate in 
the 12-week group) was above the noninferiority 
margin of −5 percentage points, then the 8-week 
regimen would be considered noninferior to the 
12-week regimen. To support the second-ranked 
primary efficacy analysis of noninferiority of 
the 8-week to the 12-week treatment duration, the 
third-ranked primary efficacy analysis was the 
same analysis, conducted in the more inclusive 
primary subset of patients, which included the pa-
tients who were excluded from the per-protocol 
population.
Sensitivity analyses were performed for the 
primary efficacy end point of the rate of sus-
tained virologic response at 12 weeks, in which 
differences in proportions of patients with sus-

Glecaprevir–Pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in HCV
tained virologic response at 12 weeks between 
the 12-week and 8-week groups across strata 
were calculated on the basis of stratum-adjusted 
Mantel–Haenszel proportions. The rate of sus-
tained virologic response at week 12 among all 
HCV genotype 1–infected patients was also as-
sessed in the intention-to-treat population and 
in patient subgroups with HIV-1 coinfection, HCV 
monoinfection, or previous sofosbuvir treatment.
ENDURANCE-3 was designed to have 90% 
power to evaluate the noninferiority of a 12-
week regimen of glecaprevir–pibrentasvir to a 
12-week regimen of sofosbuvir–daclatasvir, with 
the use of a noninferiority margin of 6 percent-
age points in the intention-to-treat analyses. 
During enrollment for the two randomly as-
signed treatment groups, phase 2 efficacy data 
became available that showed a 97% rate of 
sustained virologic response at 12 weeks among 
patients infected with HCV genotype 3 after 
8 weeks of treatment with glecaprevir–pibrent-
asvir17; in consultation with regulatory agencies, 
we added an 8-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir treat-
ment group to which patients were nonran-
domly assigned. We used the same eligibility 
criteria for this treatment group, and sample-
size considerations for direct statistical com-
parisons with the two 12-week treatment groups 
were taken into account. All statistical tests were 
performed in the intention-to-treat population, 
defined as all patients who received at least one 
dose of trial drug. Statistical comparisons be-
tween the 12-week treatment groups and the 
8-week group were added to the protocol and 
statistical analysis plan and approved by regula-
tory agencies. Noninferiority of the 8-week 
regimen to the 12-week regimen of glecaprevir–
pibrentasvir with regard to the rate of sustained 
virologic response at 12 weeks was shown with 
80% power if the lower bound of the confidence 
interval for the differences was above the non-
inferiority margin of −6 percentage points or if 
the lower bound of the confidence interval for 
the within-group rate was higher than 92%. This 
threshold corresponds to the historical 98% rate 
of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks as-
sociated with sofosbuvir–daclatasvir in the same 
population, minus the 6-percentage-point non-
inferiority margin.11 To control the type I error 
rate, the fixed-sequence testing procedure and 
Hochberg procedure18 were used during the pri-
mary efficacy analyses; details on the use of this 
procedure in the trial are provided in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
For both trials, noninferiority margins of 5 or 
6 percentage points were selected in consultation 
with regulatory agencies and in accordance with 
the principles outlined in guidance on conduct-
ing noninferiority trials; the choice of margins 
was justified on the basis of perceived medical 
benefit over historical controls and ensured min-
imal to no loss of efficacy.19-21 More details on 
the multiplicity adjustment, the study population 
size, the noninferiority margin, and the calcula-
tion of confidence intervals are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
SAS software, version 9.3, for the UNIX oper-
ating system (SAS Institute) was used for all 
descriptive statistics and analysis. Data were 
analyzed by the AbbVie Statistics and Statistical 
Programming and Clinical Pharmacology and 
Pharmacometrics Departments.
Results
Patients and Treatment
In total, 1410 patients were screened between 
October 21, 2015, and May 4, 2016; 200 patients 
were excluded from the trial at screening, pre-
dominantly because of unmet eligibility criteria 
(185 of 200 patients; 92%) (Fig. 1, and Fig. S1 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Overall, 1053 
patients underwent randomization, and 1051 of 
these patients were treated: 351 HCV genotype 1–
infected patients received glecaprevir–pibrentas-
vir for 8 weeks, 352 genotype 1–infected patients 
and 233 genotype 3–infected patients received 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for 12 weeks, and 115 
genotype 3–infected patients received sofosbuvir–
daclatasvir for 12 weeks. An additional 157 geno-
type 3–infected patients received glecaprevir–
pibrentasvir for 8 weeks without undergoing 
randomization.
The characteristics of the patients at baseline 
were generally similar among the treatment groups 
(Tables 1 and 2). The prevalence of stage F3 fibro-
sis was higher among the genotype 3–infected 
patients in the 8-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
group than among patients in the other treat-
ment groups (17%, as compared with 8 to 9%).

type 3 who had baseline HCV RNA levels of

Glecaprevir–Pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in HCV
6 million IU per milliliter or higher was higher 
in the 12-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir group 
than in the sofosbuvir–daclatasvir group (28% vs. 
12%). A total of 33 patients coinfected with HCV 
genotype 1 and HIV-1 were enrolled.
Among patients infected with HCV genotype 1, 
the prevalence of polymorphisms in NS3 or NS5A 
was similar in the 8-week and 12-week treat-
ment groups. Genotype 3–infected patients who 
were treated for 8 weeks had a higher rate of 
NS5A polymorphisms at baseline than did those 
who were treated for 12 weeks (Table 2, and 
Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
most common NS5A polymorphisms were at 
positions A30 and Y93. Among patients infected 
with genotype 3, the prevalence of the A30K 
variant was 10% in the 8-week glecaprevir–pibrent-
asvir group, as compared with 5% among the 
patients receiving 12 weeks of treatment with 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir and 4% among patients 
receiving 12 weeks of treatment with sofosbuvir–
daclatasvir, and the prevalence of the Y93H variant 
was 5% in the 12-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
group, 7% in the 12-week sofosbuvir–daclatasvir 
group, and 3% in the 8-week glecaprevir–pibrent-
asvir group.
Efficacy among Patients with HCV Genotype 1 
Infection
Of the 703 genotype 1–infected patients, 1 had 
breakthrough infection during treatment (the 
patient was enrolled in the 8-week treatment 
group; details are provided in Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix); there were no relapses. 
In the primary subset of patients, the rate of sus-
tained virologic response at 12 weeks was 99.1% 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 98 to 100) in the 
8-week group and 99.7% (95% CI, 99 to 100) in 
the 12-week group. The rate of sustained viro-
logic response at 12 weeks in the per-protocol 
population was 100% regardless of treatment 
duration (Fig. 2A). All patients with HIV-1 co-
infection (33 patients) or previous sofosbuvir 
treatment (3 patients) had a sustained virologic 
response at week 12 (Fig. S2 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
The results of the three ranked analyses of 
the primary efficacy end point in this trial all 
indicated that the 8-week treatment duration 
was noninferior to the 12-week treatment dura-
tion. Noninferiority of the 12-week treatment

primary analysis) was shown by the 95% lower 
confidence limit for the rate of sustained viro-
logic response at week 12 (99.7%; 95% CI, 99 to 
100) in the primary subset exceeding 91%. The 
noninferiority of the 8-week regimen to the 12-
week regimen was shown by the 95% lower 
confidence bound for the difference in rates of 
sustained virologic response at week 12 falling 
above −5 percentage points in both the per-
protocol population (difference, 0.0 percentage 
points; 95% CI, −1.1 to 1.1; second ranked pri-
mary analysis) and the primary subset (differ-
ence, −0.6 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.3 to 
0.9; third ranked primary analysis).
Rates of sustained virologic response at 12 
weeks according to baseline factors such as HCV 
subtype, NS3 or NS5A polymorphisms, plasma 
HCV RNA level, fibrosis stage, and treatment 
history are shown in Table S6 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. The rate of sustained virologic re-
sponse at 12 weeks among genotype 1–infected 
patients with a baseline plasma HCV RNA level 
higher than 6 million IU per milliliter was 100% 
(95% CI, 93 to 100; 49 of 49 patients) in the 
8-week group and 98% (95% CI, 88 to 99.6; 42 
of 43 patients) in the 12-week group. There were 
no relapses between post-treatment week 12 and 
post-treatment week 24 (final study visit) (Table 
S10 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Efficacy among Patients with HCV Genotype 3 
Infection
Among HCV genotype 3–infected patients, gleca-
previr–pibrentasvir treatment for 12 weeks re-
sulted in a rate of sustained virologic response 
of 95% (95% CI, 93 to 98; 222 of 233 patients), 
for which the lower bound of the 95% confi-
dence interval was higher than 92%; sofosbuvir–
daclatasvir for 12 weeks resulted in a rate of 97% 
(95% CI, 93 to 99.9; 111 of 115 patients) 
(Fig. 2B). The difference in the rate of sustained 
virologic response at 12 weeks between the 12-
week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir group and the 
12-week sofosbuvir–daclatasvir group was −1.2 
percentage points (95% CI, −5.6 to 3.1), for 
which the lower bound of the 95% confidence 
interval was higher than −6 percentage points. 
These results showed that the 12-week glecapre-
vir–pibrentasvir regimen was noninferior to the 
12-week regimen of sofosbuvir–daclatasvir. The 
8-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir group had a rate 
of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks of

Glecaprevir–Pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in HCV
95% (95% CI, 91 to 98; 149 of 157 patients). 
Although the lower bound of the 95% confi-
dence interval in the 8-week glecaprevir–pibrent-
asvir group was not higher than 92%, according 
to the prespecified hierarchical testing proce-
dure, noninferiority of the 8-week regimen to 
the 12-week regimen of glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
was shown because the difference in rates be-
tween the two groups was −0.4 percentage points 
(97.5% CI, −5.4 to 4.6), for which the lower 
bound of the 97.5% confidence interval was 
above −6 percentage points.
We did not test the superiority of 12 weeks of 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir to 12 weeks of sofosbu-
vir–daclatasvir because of the fixed-sequence 
statistical procedure, which required both non-
inferiority criteria to be met for the comparison 
between the 8-week and 12-week regimens of 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir in order to proceed to 
testing the next ordered comparison. The differ-
ence in rates of virologic relapse after 8 weeks 
and 12 weeks of treatment (3% and 1%, respec-
tively) was 2.0 percentage points, for which the 
95% confidence interval overlapped zero (95% CI, 
−1.2 to 6.3); details for all patients with viro-
logic failure are provided in Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. One patient with HCV 
genotype 3a infection who was treated for 12 
weeks with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir had reinfec-
tion, as determined by phylogenetic analysis. 
The reasons for a lack of a sustained virologic 
response at 12 weeks are shown in Table 3, the 
reasons for premature discontinuation of treat-
ment are shown in Table S7 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix, and the rates of sustained viro-
logic response at 12 weeks according to baseline 
factors are shown in Table S8 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix. There were no relapses between 
post-treatment week 12 and post-treatment week 
24 (final study visit) (Table S10 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Glecaprevir–pibrentasvir treatment for 12 weeks 
yielded a rate of sustained virologic response at 
12 weeks of 95% (95% CI, 85 to 99; 41 of 43 
patients) among patients with baseline NS5A 
polymorphisms and 99% (95% CI, 96 to 99.7; 
177 of 179 patients) among patients without 
such polymorphisms (Table S9 in the Supple-
Figure 2. Efficacy of Glecaprevir–Pibrentasvir Regimen.
Panel A shows the rates of SVR12 for the 8-week treatment duration and 12-week treatment duration in the primary 
subset and per-protocol populations of patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1 infection. The primary sub-
set excludes patients with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 coinfection or previous treatment with sofosbuvir. 
The per-protocol population excludes patients in the primary subset who prematurely discontinued treatment or 
had virologic failure during treatment before week 8 and patients without virologic failure who had no HCV RNA 
level in the SVR12 assessment window. For the primary subset, in the 8-week group, one patient with genotype 1a 
infection who had previously received HCV treatment had virologic failure at day 29 of treatment, one patient dis-
continued on day 2 because of nonadherence, and SVR12 data were missing for one patient. In the 12-week group, 
SVR12 data were missing for one patient. Panel B shows SVR12 rates in the intention-to-treat population of patients 
with HCV genotype 3 infection who did not have cirrhosis and had not received previous HCV treatment. Two-sided 
95% confidence intervals (I bars) were calculated with the normal approximation to the binomial distribution.

mentary Appendix). Among patients treated with 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for 8 weeks, the rates of 
sustained virologic response at 12 weeks were 
91% (95% CI, 78 to 96; 39 of 43 patients) for 
patients with NS5A polymorphisms at baseline 
and 98% (95% CI, 94 to 99.5; 108 of 110 pa-
tients) for patients without NS5A polymorphisms 
at baseline. The rates of sustained virologic re-
sponse at 12 weeks among patients with the 
Y93H variant at baseline were 100% (5 of 5 pa-
tients) in the 8-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
group, 91% (95% CI, 62 to 98; 10 of 11 patients) 
in the 12-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir group, 
and 88% (7 of 8 patients) in the 12-week sofos-
buvir–daclatasvir group; among patients with 
the A30K variant at baseline, the rates were 75% 
(95% CI, 51 to 90; 12 of 16 patients) in the 
8-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir group, 90.0% 
(95% CI, 60 to 98; 9 of 10 patients) in the 12-
week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir group, and 100% 
(5 of 5 patients) in the 12-week sofosbuvir– 
daclatasvir group.
Safety
The safety profile of glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
was similar among patients treated for 8 or 12 
weeks (Table 4, and Table S11 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). The most common adverse events 
(occurring in at least 10% of patients) were head-
ache and fatigue. Across both trials, two patients 
prematurely discontinued trial treatment be-
cause of adverse events that were assessed by the 
investigators as having a reasonable possibility 
of being related to direct-acting antivirals: one 
patient (genotype 3, 12-week glecaprevir–pibrent-
asvir group) discontinued treatment because of 
abdominal pain, headache, and malaise, and 
one patient (genotype 3, 12-week sofosbuvir–
daclatasvir group) discontinued because of head-
ache. Three additional patients discontinued trial 
treatment because of adverse events that were 
assessed by the investigators as unlikely to be 
related to direct-acting antivirals. Three patients 
died during the post-treatment period of the 
trials: two patients died from heroin overdoses, 
and one died from acute ethanol intoxication 
and combined methadone toxicity; all three 
events were deemed unrelated to the trial drugs. 
Across both trials, serious adverse events were 
reported in 1 to 2% of patients in each treatment 
group; none were deemed related to the trial 
drugs (Table S12 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 
occurred in less than 1% of patients (Table 4, 
and Table S13 in the Supplementary Appendix).

bilirubin levels; all elevations predominantly in-
volved indirect bilirubin and were not accompa-
nied by increases in alanine aminotransferase 
levels. None of the patients who were treated 
with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir had postnadir ele-
vations in alanine aminotransferase levels that 
were grade 3 or higher (i.e., to >5 times the upper 
limit of the normal value). All HIV-1–coinfected 
patients had continued suppression of HIV-1 RNA 
levels (to <200 copies per milliliter) during the 
treatment period, and none required a change in 
baseline antiretroviral therapy regimen. More 
information on the cohort of patients coinfected 
with HIV-1 and HCV is provided in Tables S14

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
infected with HCV genotype 1 or genotype 3 
result in high rates of sustained virologic re-
sponse,4-7,11,12 patients could benefit from shorter-
duration treatment options that maintain high 
efficacy irrespective of HCV genotype. Until re-
cently, there were no approved treatment regi-
mens with a duration of less than 12 weeks for 
patients with HCV genotype 3 infection, and 
8-week treatment options for patients with geno-
type 1 infection were limited according to virus 
subtype, treatment history, fibrosis stage, or base-
line viral load.8,9 In the present trials, 8 weeks of 
treatment with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir resulted 
in high rates of sustained virologic response at 
12 weeks among patients without cirrhosis who 
had HCV genotype 1 infection (>99%) or geno-
type 3 infection (95%). A treatment duration 
of 8 weeks was noninferior to a duration of 
12 weeks with regard to the rate of sustained 
virologic response at 12 weeks.
Glecaprevir–pibrentasvir treatment was asso-
ciated with low rates of serious adverse events 
or clinically significant laboratory abnormalities; 
there were no elevations of grade 3 or higher in 
alanine aminotransferase levels. Adverse events 
that have historically been attributed to HCV 
protease inhibitors, such as severe rash, de-
creased neutrophil count, anemia, and elevated 
alanine aminotransferase levels, were not ob-
served with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir treatment. 
Although protease inhibitors such as paritaprevir 
or simeprevir have been associated with hyper-
bilirubinemia,22 across both trials, 4 of 1093 pa-
tients (0.4%) who were treated with glecaprevir–
pibrentasvir had isolated grade 3 increases in 
total bilirubin level (all predominantly involving 
indirect bilirubin), a frequency lower than with 
other HCV protease inhibitors.22-24 Overall, the 
frequency and severity of adverse events ob-
served with the NS3/4A protease inhibitor–con-
taining glecaprevir–pibrentasvir regimen was 
similar to that observed with the NS5B nucleo-
tide polymerase inhibitor–containing regimen of 
sofosbuvir–daclatasvir. All patients who were 
coinfected with HIV-1 and HCV had continued 
HIV-1 suppression throughout the trial.
The ability to shorten treatment duration with-
out compromising efficacy remains an important 
goal in therapy for all HCV genotypes. In addi-
tion to the results with 8 weeks of treatment for 
patients with HCV genotype 1 or genotype 3 from 
these two trials, recent phase 3 trials have shown 
that an 8-week regimen of treatment with gleca-
previr–pibrentasvir in patients without cirrhosis 
who have HCV genotype 2 infection or genotype 
4, 5, or 6 infection yielded rates of sustained 
virologic response at 12 weeks of 98% and 93% 
(with no virologic failures), respectively.25-27
These trials were not designed or powered to 
formally compare responses across subgroups de-
fined according to baseline characteristics. None-
theless, in ENDURANCE-1, there were no re-
lapses among HCV genotype 1–infected patients 
who were treated for 8 weeks, regardless of their 
baseline HCV RNA level, and glecaprevir–pibrent-
asvir treatment yielded high rates of sustained 
virologic response among genotype 1–infected 
patients regardless of baseline characteristics 
that have historically been associated with lower 
efficacy.28
In ENDURANCE-3, efficacy was assessed with 
respect to the presence of NS5A polymorphisms 
at baseline. NS5A polymorphisms, such as A30K 
and Y93H, can have important clinical implica-
tions, particularly for patients infected with 
HCV genotype 3, because they confer a high 
degree of resistance to currently available NS5A 
inhibitors and have been associated with lower 
rates of response to treatment. For example, the 
HCV genotype 3 Y93H polymorphism decreases 
the susceptibility of the virus to velpatasvir and 
daclatasvir, resulting in half-maximal effective 
concentrations that are increased by factors 
greater than 100 and 3700, respectively5,29; the 
A30K polymorphism reduces the susceptibility 
of the virus to daclatasvir, resulting in a half-
maximal concentration that is increased by a 
factor of 117.29 In contrast, single HCV genotype 
3a A30K and Y93H polymorphisms or substitu-
tions confer minimal decreases in susceptibility 
to pibrentasvir in vitro (with respective half-
maximal concentrations increased by a factor 
of <2.5).15,30 In ENDURANCE-3, among patients 
with the Y93H variant at baseline, 15 of 16 patients 
(94%; 95% CI, 72 to 99) treated with glecaprevir–
pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 weeks had a sustained 
virologic response at 12 weeks, including 5 of 
5 patients (100%) who were treated for 8 weeks. 
Genotype 3–infected patients who were treated 
with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir and who had the 
A30K variant in NS5A at baseline had a lower 
rate of sustained virologic response at 12 weeks

Glecaprevir–Pibrentasvir for 8 or 12 Weeks in HCV
than patients without A30K (81% [21 of 26] vs. 
99% [344 of 349]). However, the majority of 
patients who were treated with glecaprevir– 
pibrentasvir had a sustained virologic response 
regardless of the presence of A30K. The low 
prevalence of the genotype 3 A30K variant re-
ported in this trial (<7% overall) and other trials 
(4.5 to 6%31,32) makes the true importance of this 
factor with regard to overall efficacy difficult to 
assess. Despite the higher prevalence of patients 
with the HCV genotype 3 A30K variant at base-
line in the 8-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir treat-
ment group, the 8-week glecaprevir–pibrentasvir 
regimen achieved noninferiority to the 12-week 
regimen in patients with genotype 3 infection.
Two patients with genotype 1 infection and 
10 patients with genotype 3 infection did not 
have a sustained virologic response at 12 weeks 
because of nonadherence to the trial regimen, 
withdrawal of informed consent, or loss to follow-
up. Specifically, the frequency of treatment failure 
for nonvirologic reasons among patients with 
genotype 3 infection appeared to be higher than 
the frequency reported in phase 3 trials involving 
similar populations.11,12 The patients infected with 
HCV genotype 1 and those infected with HCV 
genotype 3 in our trials differed with regard to 
several baseline characteristics: patients with 
genotype 3 infection were younger (median age, 
47 to 49 years vs. 52 to 53 years), more likely to 
be receiving opiate substitution therapy (15 to 
20% vs. 3 to 4%), and more likely to be current 
injection drug users (3 to 6% vs. 1%) than pa-
tients with HCV genotype 1 infection. It is nota-
ble that 65% of enrolled patients with genotype 3 
infection had a history of injection drug use, 
which is in line with the reported high prevalence 
of people who inject drugs among those who have 
HCV genotype 3 (approximately 50 to 65%).33-36
There are some limitations to these trials. 
Despite the fact that the same eligibility criteria, 
similar trial sites, and similar sample-size con-
siderations were used in the two trials, the lack 
of random assignment to the treatment groups 
for the comparison of the 8-week and 12-week 
durations of glecaprevir–pibrentasvir treatment in 
genotype 3–infected patients may explain the im-
balances in baseline conditions described above 
and could have affected the efficacy assessment. 
Another potential limitation was the open-label 
nature of ENDURANCE-3, which could have 
biased the safety comparison between the treat-
ment groups. A third limitation was the small 
number of patients enrolled in ENDURANCE-1 
who had previously received sofosbuvir. How-
ever, patients with treatment-associated substi-
tutions after sofosbuvir treatment failure are not 
expected to be harder to cure than other patients 
in this trial, given the nonoverlapping mecha-
nism of action of sofosbuvir with those of gleca-
previr and pibrentasvir. Finally, there were small 
numbers of patients in some of the genotype 1 
subgroups, particularly the subgroups of pa-
tients with F3 fibrosis, HIV-1 coinfection, and 
black race.
Treatment with glecaprevir–pibrentasvir for 
8 weeks yielded rates of sustained virologic re-
sponse at 12 weeks of 99% and 95% in patients 
without cirrhosis who had HCV genotype 1 in-
fection or genotype 3 infection, respectively, 
which indicated that 8 weeks of treatment with 
glecaprevir–pibrentasvir is an efficacious treat-
ment option for HCV genotype 1 or 3 infection.
