Released prisoners diagnosed with psychotic disorders 
have elevated rates of violent reoffending risk and their 
exposure to adverse neighborhood environments may con-
tribute to this risk. We identified all released sentenced 
prisoners in Sweden between 2003 and 2013 (n = 47 226) 
and followed them up for a median period of 4.4 years. We 
identified prisoners who had ever been diagnosed with a 
psychotic disorder (n = 3782) or prescribed antipsychotics 
(n = 7366). We examined 3 neighborhood characteristics: 
income, proportion of welfare recipients, and crime rate. 
By fitting generalized mixed-effects and negative bino-
mial regression models and adopting within-individual 
designs that controlled for all time-invariant unmeasured 
confounders within each individual, we estimated neigh-
borhood intraclass correlations (ICCs) and associations 
between specific neighborhood characteristics and vio-
lent reoffending. Neighborhood factors explained 13.5% 
(95% CI: 10.9%; 16.6%) of the violent reoffending risk 
among released prisoners diagnosed with psychotic disor-
ders. This contrasted with 4.3% (95% CI: 3.7%; 4.9%) 
in all released prisoners. However, after controlling for 
unmeasured confounding, these estimates were not sta-
tistically significant (ICCpsychotic disorders = 0.9%; 95% CI: 
−0.8%; 2.3%; ICCall prisoners = 0.3%; 95% CI: −0.02%; 
0.6%). Similarly, none of the within-individual correla-
tions between the specific neighborhood factors and vio-
lent reoffending were significantly different from zero. 
We found consistent results when we investigated prison-
ers with other psychiatric and substance use disorders. 
These findings suggest that placing released prisoners 
with psychotic disorders in less deprived neighborhoods 
might not reduce their violent reoffending risk, which 
may also apply to other psychiatric disorders. The assess-
ment, treatment, and community linkage of high-risk 
prisoners as a strategy to reduce reoffending needs fur-
ther research.

Introduction
The global prison population reached an estimated 10.4 
million individuals in 2015, which represents a 20% 
increase since 2000.1 Nearly 30 million individuals enter 
and leave prisons each year across the world.2 Around 
two-thirds of released prisoners in the United States are 
rearrested within 3 years,3,4 with similarly high reoffend-
ing rates reported in other high income countries.5 High 
reoffending rates have been attributed to concentrating 
released prisoners in socioeconomically deprived neigh-
borhoods, characterized by poor employment opportuni-
ties, weak public institutions (eg, schools and community 
organizations), and increased residential mobility and 
antisocial behaviors.6 Although some evidence suggests 
that neighborhood factors predict reoffending,7–9 it is 
uncertain whether neighborhood influences affect for-
mer prisoners with psychotic disorders who reoffend at 
higher rates than other prisoners.10,11 Expert opinion sug-
gests that violence prevention efforts in released prison-
ers should not only focus on treating mental illnesses and 
substance use disorders but also address a wider range 
of socioeconomic factors.12,13 But their effectiveness will 
depend on whether associations between socioeconomic 
status and violent reoffending are consistent with a causal 
inference. To date, this has been lacking.
To address methodological limitations of previous 
research, we used nationwide registry data on a sample 
of all Swedish prisoners who were released between 2003 
and 2013 (n = 47 226). We were able to obtain annual 
measures of their residential areas throughout the entire

follow-up period, which allowed us to examine the time-
varying associations between 3 objective measures of 
neighborhood characteristics from high-quality registers, 
namely the median income, proportion of individuals 
receiving means-tested welfare benefits, and crime rate, 
and subsequent violent reoffending. In complemen-
tary analyses, we also considered 2 alternative measures 
of socioeconomic status: disposable income and wel-
fare recipiency. To account for unmeasured confound-
ers, we adopted, for the first time to our knowledge, a 
within-individual research design, where each individual 
served as their own controls across time, which allowed 
us to indirectly control for an aggregate of all of their 
time-constant confounders (eg, genetic and early child-
hood risks). The large and representative sample further 
allowed us to examine subsamples of individuals who 
had ever been diagnosed with or prescribed medication 
for psychotic disorders. In addition, the sample allowed 
us to compare the latter findings with a large number of 
other psychiatric and substance use disorders.
Methods
Study Setting
We linked 8 nationwide high-quality registers. The Prison 
and Probation Services Register provided dates of impris-
onment in Swedish prisons between 2003 and 2013. We 
obtained dates of violent crime convictions from the 
National Crime Register, which includes all criminal con-
victions in lower general court in Sweden since 1973. Data 
on residential areas were gathered from the Small Area 
Marketing Statistics (SAMS) Register, which is main-
tained by Statistics Sweden and includes geo-coded data 
for all individuals. The geo-coded data are based on the 
registered addresses of all Swedish residents retrieved 
from the National Tax Agency at the end of each year. 
The coverage is nearly complete as it is legally manda-
tory for all residents to register their physical address with 
the agency. The Integrated Database for Labor Market 
Research provided annual data on sociodemographic fac-
tors between 1990 and 2013 for all individuals aged more 
than 16, who were alive and registered as residents at the 
end of each year. Emigration and mortality dates came 
from the Migration and the Causes of Death Registers, 
respectively. The Prescribed Drug Register included data 
on all dispensed prescription drugs with Anatomical 
Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) codes between July 1, 2005 
and December 31, 2013. The National Patient Register 
(NPR) provided data on all inpatient hospitalization 
episodes (ICD-8, -9, and -10; 1973–2013) and specialist 
outpatient care visits (ICD-10; 2001–2013). The NPR is 
comprehensive to the universal health coverage in Sweden.
All Swedish residents are assigned a unique 10-digit 
civic registration number, either at birth or upon immi-
gration, which is used in all nationwide registers, and 
accurate linkage. We selected a cohort of all released 
prisoners who had served any number of prison sen-
tences between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2013. 
All individuals were followed up from their date of prison 
release up until migration, re-incarceration, death or end 
of follow-up (December 31, 2013). If they had served 
multiple sentences, we included all of their person-time in 
the community and censored them according to the same 
criteria. Anonymized data was received from Statistics 
Sweden following Regional Research Ethics Committee 
approval at Karolinska Institutet (2013/5:8).
Measures
Neighborhood Definition
In keeping with previous population-based research,14 we 
used the SAMS definition of Swedish neighborhoods, 
which identifies approximately 9200 geographically small 
and socioeconomically homogenous residential areas 
based on the local housing profile. The average popula-
tion size of SAMS neighborhoods is about 1000 individu-
als, which corresponds to a quarter of that of the average 
census tract in the United States.15 Smaller neighborhood 
definitions tend to increase the explained variation in crim-
inal offending by maximizing the within-neighborhood 
similarities between the residents.16 Qualitative valida-
tion studies have demonstrated that the SAMS neighbor-
hood definition strongly overlaps with public perceptions 
of neighborhood boundaries.17 There are considerable 
socioeconomic status differences across Swedish neighbor-
hoods; the prevalence rate of welfare recipiency is 30 times 
more common in most deprived compared with most 
affluent neighborhoods.18
Exposure Variables
We examined 3 annual measures of neighborhood charac-
teristics that we generated by aggregating data on all resi-
dents aged 25–64 years. Neighborhood income was defined 
as the standardized, and reverse-coded, median dispos-
able income (eg, net sum of all earnings and benefits). 
Neighborhood welfare measured the standardized preva-
lence rate of residents who had received means-tested wel-
fare benefits at least once during the year. Neighborhood 
crime was defined as the number of criminal convictions in 
a given year divided by the number of neighborhood resi-
dents. All 3 measures were treated as continuous variables 
in the statistical analyses with the exception of the descrip-
tive tables, where we present them as tertiles.
We additionally examined 3 alternative exposure 
variables that were not measured on the neighborhood 
level—disposable income, welfare benefits, and resi-
dential relocations. Disposable income was defined as 
the standardized, and reverse-coded, annual disposable 
income. Welfare benefits referred to the individual being 
granted means-tested welfare benefits during a given year. 
Residential relocations measured the number of home

address changes reported to the National Tax Agency 
during a given year.
Violent Reoffending
Consistent with previous studies,19 we defined violent 
criminality as homicide, assault, robbery, threats and 
violence against an officer, gross violation of a person’s 
integrity, unlawful threats, unlawful coercion, kidnap-
ping, illegal confinement, arson, intimidation, or sexual 
offenses (rape, indecent assault, indecent exposure, or 
child molestation, but excluding prostitution, hiring of 
prostitutes, or possession of child pornography).
Psychotic, Other Psychiatric, and Substance Use 
Disorders
Individuals who had ever been diagnosed with a schizo-
phrenia-spectrum disorder (ICD-8: 295, 297–299; ICD-
9: 295, 297–298; ICD-10: F20–F29) or bipolar disorder 
(ICD-8: 296 [excl. 296.2]; ICD-9: 296 [excl. 296B]; ICD-
10: F30–F31) as an inpatient (1973–2013) or outpatient 
(2001–2013) were defined as having any psychotic disor-
der. We further included individuals that had ever been 
diagnosed with any personality disorder (ICD-8 and 
ICD-9: 301; ICD-10: F60–F69), unipolar depression 
(ICD-8: 296.2, 300.4; ICD-9: 296B, 300E, 311; ICD-10: 
F32–F39 [excl. F32.3]), anxiety (ICD-8: 300 [excl. 300.4]; 
ICD-9. 300 [excl. 300E]; ICD-10: F40–F48 [excl. F43]), 
alcohol use disorder (ICD-8: 291, 303; ICD-9: 291, 303, 
305A; ICD-10: F10) and drug use disorder (ICD-8: 292, 
304; ICD-9: 292, 304, 305X; ICD-10: F11–F12, F14–F16, 
F19). The Swedish registries have been extensively used to 
study a wide range of psychiatric disorders and external 
validation studies have confirmed that even single episode 
diagnoses of schizophrenia,20 bipolar disorder,21 person-
ality disorder,22 depression,23 anxiety,24 and substance use 
disorders25 are valid. In complementary analyses, we also 
included individuals who had ever been prescribed anti-
psychotics (ATC: N05A [excl. N05AN01]), mood stabi-
lizers (ATC: N03AF01-N03AF02, N03AG01, N03AX09, 
N05AN01), anxiolytics (ATC: N05B), antidepressants 
(ATC: N06A) and drugs used in alcohol dependence 
(ATC: N07BB), and opioid dependence (ATC: N07BC) 
between 2005 and 2013.
Analytic Approach
We estimated neighborhood intraclass correlations 
(ICCs) for violent reoffending as an ordered categorical 
measure by fitting a series of generalized linear mixed-
effects models (GLMMs).26 The neighborhood ICC sta-
tistic ranges between 0 and 1 and expresses the proportion 
of variance in violent reoffending risk that is attributed to 
neighborhood influences.27 Standard approaches to esti-
mating neighborhood ICCs are typically biased because 
they make the implicit assumption that the choice of 
neighborhood residence is randomly distributed in the 
population. Our complex data structure on individu-
als who moved between different neighborhoods across 
time, allowed us to address this limitation by controlling 
for nonrandom self-selection patterns. To estimate the 
magnitude of this bias, we fitted 2 separate models that 
estimated the crude and the within-individual neighbor-
hood ICCs. We fitted the crude models in Stata 14 MP 
(meologit) and the within-individual models in Mplus 7.4 
(TYPE=CROSSCLASSIFIED).
To quantify the associations between each neighbor-
hood exposure variable and violent reoffending, we esti-
mated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and corresponding 
95% CIs by fitting 2 separate negative binomial regres-
sion models.28 The negative binomial distribution is pre-
ferred over the Poisson distribution when count outcome 
variables are over-dispersed due to a preponderance of 
zeros, which violates an assumption of the latter by inflat-
ing the variance relative to the mean. We allowed for the 
exposure variables to vary annually across the follow-
up period and applied cluster-robust standard errors to 
account for the nested data structure of measurement 
occasions being nested within individuals. In Model I, we 
estimated the crude effect of each exposure variable on 
violent reoffending.
To examine the causal nature of the crude associa-
tions, we subsequently examined the within-individual 
associations between exposure variables and reoffend-
ing risk. The rationale for this natural experimental 
approach is to make the individuals serve as their own 
controls across time, thus controlling for an aggregate of 
all time-constant confounders in each individual (eg, all 
genetic and early environmental influences). This means 
that measured time-constant confounders, such as sex 
and immigrant background, are controlled for and do 
not need to be included in the models. Consistent with 
the between-within decomposition approach,29 we parti-
tioned the exposure variables into a time-constant mean 
effect, known as the “between-individual effect,” and 
the time-varying deviations from the mean, known as 
the “within-individual effect.” For the associations to be 
consistent with a causal inference, one would assume that 
an individual who is, relative to their own mean (eg, the 
between-effect), exposed to higher levels of deprivation at 
specific time points (eg, the within-effect) to be more likely 
to violently reoffend. The Model II estimates refer to the 
within-individual, and age-adjusted, estimates. We fitted 
Models I–II in Stata 14 MP using the nbreg command.
Sensitivity Analyses
To test for potential confounding by gender, ethnicity, 
and population size, we re-ran Models I–II on subsamples 
excluding females, individuals with an immigrant back-
ground, and those who lived in neighborhoods with less 
than 1500 inhabitants. We also tested whether individuals

who moved between different neighborhoods across time 
were generalizable to the entire population of prisoners 
by comparing the age-adjusted rates of violent reoffend-
ing between the groups. We subsequently examined the 
effects of the neighborhood exposures (eg, neighborhood 
income, welfare recipients, and crime rate) in residentially 
mobile individuals by re-running the models using the 
average values of the exposures for each neighborhood 
across the entire study period. By removing the annual 
fluctuations, only individuals who had moved between 
different neighborhoods were able to contribute to the 
latter models. We explored the extent to which the dura-
tion of exposure to the neighborhood characteristics 
predicted violent reoffending risks by modifying Model 
II to include an interaction term between each of the 
3 neighborhood exposure variables and the duration 
of time (in days) that the individual had resided in the 
neighborhood. We further assessed the sensitivity of 
our neighborhood definition by considering larger geo-
graphical representations (eg, parishes, municipalities, 
and counties). We tested the generalizability of our find-
ings by fitting GLMMs to estimate within-individual cor-
relations for each exposure variable across the follow-up 
period, thus examining the extent to which individuals 
were exposed to varying socioeconomic levels. We used 
Bonferroni correction to minimize the risks of obtaining 
false-positive results.
Results
We identified a total of 47 226 individuals released from 
Swedish prisons during the study period and followed 
them up for a median of 4.4 years. The lifetime preva-
lence rate of any psychotic disorders was 8% (n = 3782), 
while the equivalent estimate for antipsychotic prescrip-
tions exceeded 15% (n = 7366). About a third (34.4%) 
had a lifetime diagnosis of any psychiatric disorder as 
inpatients or outpatients (n = 16 262), nearly half (49.2%) 
were diagnosed with substance use disorders by psychi-
atric services (n = 23 212) and a majority (54.7%) had 
been prescribed psychiatric medications (n = 25 831). The 
absolute rates of violent reoffending were elevated in psy-
chiatric disorders, particularly in those diagnosed with 
psychotic and personality disorders, as well as in certain 
sociodemographic categories, including males, younger 
age groups, and during periods of disadvantage across all 
of the examined exposure variables (table 1). We observed 
a similar pattern of sociodemographic effects, albeit gen-
erally with higher absolute risks, in the subsamples of 
individuals diagnosed with psychotic, other psychiatric 
and substance use disorders (ST1–ST12).
We initially observed that neighborhood influences 
accounted for approximately 4% of the violent reoffend-
ing risk (ICC = 4.3%; 95% CI: 3.7%; 4.9%; table 2). After 
controlling for unmeasured confounding, this effect was 
not significantly different from zero (ICC = 0.3%; 95% CI: 
−0.02%; 0.6%; table 2). In psychotic disorders, the pro-
portion of variation in violent reoffending risk explained 
by neighborhoods changed from 13.5% (95% CI: 10.9%; 
16.6%) in the unadjusted model to a not statistically sig-
nificant estimate of 0.9% (95% CI: −0.8%; 2.3%) in the 
within-individual model, and in those taking antipsychot-
ics, the equivalent estimates were reduced from 6.9% (95% 
CI: 5.4%; 8.7%) to 0.4% (95% CI: −0.4%; 1.1%). In other 
words, by considering residential relocations in individu-
als who moved between different neighborhoods across 
time, we found no statistically significant contributions 
of neighborhood influences on violent reoffending risk.
The adjusted estimates in prisoners with other psy-
chiatric and substance use disorders were similar in 
magnitude (table 2). There was no evidence that these 
findings were attributed to the choice of our geographi-
cal representation as larger areas (eg, parishes, munici-
palities, and counties) explained substantially smaller 
proportions of the risk differences in violent reoffending 
(ST13). Furthermore, we found no statistically significant 
(P = .136) differences in age-adjusted violent reoffending 
rates between those who relocated to different neighbor-
hoods (n = 25 696) compared to those who stayed in the 
same neighborhood (n = 21 530) during follow-up.
All of the specific neighborhood exposure variables 
predicted subsequent violent reoffending on the popula-
tion level (figure 1). A standardized unit decrease in the 
median neighborhood income was, for instance, associ-
ated with a 7% increased reoffending rate (IRR = 1.07; 
95% CI: 1.03; 1.11). This association was, however, 
entirely attenuated in the age-adjusted, within-individual 
model (IRR = 0.97; 95% CI: 0.92; 1.02). We found similar 
results across the remaining neighborhood factors and in 
the subsamples of individuals that met criteria for psychi-
atric and substance use disorders (figure 1 and table 3). 
We note that the inverse within-individual association 
between neighborhood welfare and violent reoffending 
in personality disorders (Model II, figure 1) was not sta-
tistically significant from zero following Bonferroni cor-
rection for multiple testing. Complementary sensitivity 
analyses using alternative exposure variables (eg, dispos-
able income, welfare benefits, and residential relocations; 
table 4) and subsamples excluding females, individuals 
with immigrant backgrounds and neighborhoods with 
fewer than 1500 residents were consistent with the pre-
sented findings (ST14). Furthermore, we found no evi-
dence that the associations between the neighborhood 
exposure variables and violent reoffending were moder-
ated by the duration of stay in each neighborhood, as all 
of the interaction terms failed to reach statistical signifi-
cance (all P-values exceeded .4). The within-individual 
correlations of exposure variables ranged between 0.28 
and 0.68 (ST15), suggesting that the findings could not be 
attributed to insufficient variability in exposures across 
time. Lastly, we found that re-running the models using 
average values of the neighborhood exposures across

the study period did not materially change the findings 
(ST16).
Discussion
In this population-based longitudinal study of all 47 226 
released prisoners in Sweden between 2003 and 2013, we 
examined the extent to which neighborhood influences 
accounted for violent reoffending over a median follow-
up of 4.4 years in prisoners with psychotic and other 
psychiatric disorders, and all prisoners. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first study examining these associations 
by adopting a within-individual research design that 
accounts for time-constant unobserved confounders (eg, 
their genetic background and childhood environmental 
influences). The latter approaches allowed us to specifi-
cally examine the neighborhood effects on violent reof-
fending risk observed when individuals moved between 
different areas, and with high-quality neighborhood 
variables on 9200 different units, this provided stable 
estimates.
Our study has 3 principal findings. First, we initially 
observed that neighborhood influences explained a sub-
stantially larger proportion of the violent reoffending

recipients, and crime rate) independently predicted sub-
sequent violent reoffending rates on the population level. 
For these associations to be consistent with a causal 
inference, we would have expected released prisoners to 
have higher rates of violent reoffending during periods 
when they resided in socioeconomically disadvantaged 
neighborhoods. However, once we had controlled for 
time-constant unobserved confounders, by re-examining 
the associations within individuals across time, there 
was no evidence of any statistically significant neighbor-
hood effects. In other words, we found that the violent 
reoffending rates were constant regardless of where the 
released prisoners lived throughout the study period, 
so the neighborhood effects (if any) were likely mini-
mal at best. Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that these 
findings were robust when using alternative exposure

variables (disposable income and welfare recipiency) and 
could not be attributed to either confounding by gender, 
ethnicity, and neighborhood population size, duration 
effects, or the lack of variation in the exposure variables 
across time.
The latter findings, suggesting that the observed asso-
ciations between socioeconomic status and violent reof-
fending are confounded, are generally consistent with 
randomized studies on housing and employment inter-
ventions for former prisoners30,31 as well as with 3 stud-
ies of adolescent offending.18,32,33 However, the results are 
not in keeping with influential studies of neighborhood 
effects on reoffending that have used inadequate con-
trols for unmeasured confounders.7–9 This is important 
because studies examining employment effects on reoff-
ending in former prisoners have shown that a sizable pro-
portion of the variation in employment could potentially 
be attributed to selection factors.34,35 This is further sup-
ported by recent quantitative and molecular genetic stud-
ies that have demonstrated that adulthood residence in 
deprived neighborhoods is a considerably heritable trait 
that partly shares its genetic architecture with cognitive 
abilities, severe mental illnesses, and antisocial behav-
iors.36,37 Taken together, the current evidence underlines 
the importance of adequately addressing unmeasured 
confounding in studies of adverse outcomes in released 
prisoners and possibly other high-risk populations. Given 
the relative lack of such controls in the contemporary 
criminological literature examining the consequences of 
adverse neighborhood conditions,38,39 it could be the case, 
as some critics have argued,18,40,41 that such studies may 
have overemphasized the etiological role played by socio-
economic factors in explaining why violent criminality 
and other antisocial behaviors tend to aggregate within 
specific types of geographical areas.
If these findings are replicated in other contexts using 
similar designs and representative samples, it would sug-
gest that efforts to support recently mentally ill released 
prisoners in securing housing in less deprived residential 
areas may not result in reduced violent reoffending. It 
is possible, however, that such interventions may have 
beneficial effects on other adverse outcomes, including 
violent victimization42 and unintended head injuries.43 
Future work may benefit from combining large-scale reg-
istry data with within-individual research designs to test 
the causal nature of such associations. Nevertheless, the 
best current evidence suggests that violence prevention 
efforts in these groups should be continued by improv-
ing the assessment and treatment of higher risk prison-
ers who suffer from psychotic, other psychiatric, and 
substance use disorders.10,11,44 The timing such services is 
seemingly also of importance as a recent within-individ-
ual study on trigger factors for violent criminality in psy-
chotic disorders demonstrated that the risk of violence 
sharply increased immediately following an exposure to 
a stressful life event (eg, violent victimization, parental 
bereavement, or an accident) as compared to earlier peri-
ods when the individuals were unexposed to the exam-
ined stressful life event.45
There are 6 main limitations to this study. First, the 
design relied on criminal conviction data to assess violent 
reoffending. Although this approach offers a compre-
hensive measure of severe violent acts, it will underesti-
mate less severe cases. Therefore, it remains an empirical 
question whether our findings would be different if any 
criminal reoffending or violence that did not lead to con-
victions were used as outcomes. However, alternative 
methods commonly used to capture less severe offences, 
such as self-report, have other limitations including high 
rates of attrition and inflated measurement error, the lat-
ter of which contributes to artificial reductions of the true 
associations, especially in within-individual designs.46 
Conviction data, on the other hand, partly reflects crimi-
nal justice practices, which is liable to detection bias in 
the most socioeconomically disadvantaged neighbor-
hoods. This means, however, that our estimates are likely 
biased upwards. Second, recent estimates indicate that 
fewer than 0.5% of the Swedish population suffer from 
acute homelessness47 and are therefore not captured by 
our neighborhood definition. To examine the extent to 
which this biased our findings, we sensitivity tested and 
were able to fully replicate our main findings by using 2 
alternative measures of socioeconomic status that were 
not neighborhood-specific, namely disposable income 
and welfare recipiency. Our findings cannot therefore be 
attributed to our inability to follow-up acutely homeless 
individuals.
Third, we were unable to measure residential moves 
to specific neighborhoods that had occurred within each 
year because the neighborhood data were derived from 
the National Tax Agency’s records at the end of each 
year. We were, however, able to measure the number of 
registered address changes within each year but we did 
not find that it predicted violent reoffending risk once 
unmeasured confounders were controlled for (table 4). 
Our findings could therefore not be attributed to higher 
residential mobility rates in former prisoners residing in 
deprived neighborhoods.
Fourth, we lacked sufficient statistical power to exam-
ine any potential differences between patients diagnosed 
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Previous stud-
ies have demonstrated important etiological differences 
between these disorders with respect to their relationship 
with violent criminality.48 We note, however, that our find-
ings were consistent across all of the examined categories 
of psychiatric disorders and prescription drugs. Similarly, 
we were underpowered to study any potential differ-
ences between specific types of violent crimes. Future 
replication efforts should therefore benefit from using 
larger samples with longer follow-up periods to examine 
whether the presented findings hold for individuals who 
commit different types of violent acts.

Neighborhood Influences on Violent Reoffending Risk
Fifth, services provided to prisoners once they are 
released vary within and between countries and we did 
not have access to such data in our sample. However, 
because our examined neighborhood factors did not pre-
dict violent reoffending rates within individuals across 
time, during periods where they had received different 
types of services, it suggests that such influences will 
likely be minimal on the examined associations.
Sixth, while there is considerable evidence that prisoner 
populations are similar across high-income countries,11 
there are relatively smaller socioeconomic differences in 
Sweden, due to its comprehensive welfare state, than in 
some other high-income countries. It should be noted, 
however, that the socioeconomic differences in Sweden 
are still large with a 30-fold increased prevalence rate 
of welfare recipiency in the most deprived compared 
to the most affluent neighborhoods.18 Although com-
parative data are scarce, a previous criminological study 
concluded that the social mechanisms that increased the 
risk of violence across neighborhoods in Stockholm and 
Chicago were quite similar in nature, despite differences 
in the poverty rates (17.5% vs 6.3%).49 Similarly, we argue 
that larger socioeconomic status differences do not a 
priori imply causality; selection mechanisms should be 
explicitly modeled for before drawing such conclusions. 
We note that the crude neighborhood correlation of 4% 
reported here is similar in magnitude to similar studies, 
mostly conducted in the United States.50
In summary, we have demonstrated using a large rep-
resentative sample of released prisoners that associations 
between neighborhood influences and later risks of vio-
lent reoffending were confounded by individual risks by 
using 2 different and complementary methodological 
approaches. Pending replication in other contexts, these 
findings suggest that efforts to assist mentally ill prison-
ers find housing in less deprived neighborhoods may not 
reduce violent reoffending. The role of assessing and 
treating higher risk prisoners with psychotic disorders in 
reducing serious reoffending needs urgent review.
