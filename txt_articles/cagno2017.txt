Viral infections kill millions yearly. Available antiviral drugs are virus-specific and active against a limited panel of human
pathogens. There are broad-spectrum substances that prevent the first step of virus–cell interaction by mimicking heparan
sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), the highly conserved target of viral attachment ligands (VALs). The reversible binding
mechanism prevents their use as a drug, because, upon dilution, the inhibition is lost. Known VALs are made of closely packed
repeating units, but the aforementioned substances are able to bind only a few of them. We designed antiviral nanoparticles
with long and flexible linkers mimicking HSPG, allowing for efective viral association with a binding that we simulate to
be strong and multivalent to the VAL repeating units, generating forces (∼190 pN) that eventually lead to irreversible
viral deformation. Virucidal assays, electron microscopy images, and molecular dynamics simulations support the proposed
mechanism. These particles show no cytotoxicity, and in vitro nanomolar irreversible activity against herpes simplex virus
(HSV), human papilloma virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue and lenti virus. They are active ex vivo in human
cervicovaginal histocultures infected by HSV-2 and in vivo in mice infected with RSV.
I
nfectious diseases account for ∼20% of global mortality, and
viruses are responsible for about one third of these deaths1. Lower
respiratory infections and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
are among the ten most common causes of deaths worldwide, and
they contribute substantially to healthcare costs2. Emerging viruses
(for example, Ebola) add yearly to this death toll. The best approach
to prevent viral infections is vaccination; however, there exist only a
limited number of vaccines, and the ones that exist are not equally
available in all parts of the world3. After infection, antiviral drugs
are the only treatment option, but even in this case there are only a
limited number of approved antiviral drugs, and they are all virus-
specific. There is a dire need for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that
can act on a large number of existing and emerging viruses.
Current therapeutics can be subdivided into small molecules
(for example, nucleoside analogues and peptidomimetics), pro-
teins able to stimulate the immune response (for example, inter-
feron), and oligonucleotides (for example, fomivirsen)4. They are
mainly directed against HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C
virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) and influenza virus. They act intracellularly, mostly on
viral enzymes that are essential for viral replication but differ from
any other host enzyme to allow for selectivity. Since viruses largely
depend on the biosynthetic machinery of infected cells for their
replication, the specificity of antiviral drugs is far from ideal, result-
ing in a general intrinsic toxicity associated with such treatment5,6.
Additionally, most viruses mutate rapidly due to error-prone repli-
cation machinery; therefore, they often develop resistance7. Finally,
the use of virus-specific proteins as a target of antiviral drugs makes
it difficult to develop broad-spectrum antivirals capable of acting
on a large number of viruses that are phylogenetically unrelated and
structurally different.
Virustatic substances act outside the cell by interfering with the
first phases of the viral replication cycle. They can be broad spec-
trum and non-toxic. Their activity depends on a reversible binding
event; the reversibility of the mechanism makes them medically
irrelevant. For example, upon dilution the substance is detached

from an unaltered viral particle, allowing the virus to infect again.
To achieve broad-spectrum efficacy, current virustatic materials (for
example, heparin, polyanions) target virus–cell interactions that are
common to many viruses. One of these interactions is that between
the VAL and its associated cell receptor responsible for the first step
of the virus replication cycle. Many viruses, including HIV-1, HSV,
HCMV, HPV, RSV and flavivirus8, exploit HSPGs as the target of
their VALs. HSPGs are expressed on the surface of almost all eu-
karyotic cell types. The binding between viruses and HSPGs usually
occurs via the interaction of closely packed arrangements of multiple
basic amino acids on the proteins, that constitute the VAL, with the
negatively charged sulfated groups of heparan sulfate (HS) in the
glycocalix of the cell surface9. A long list of HSPG-mimicking ma-
terials such as heparin10,11, sulfated polysaccharides9,12, or sulfonic-
acid-decorated polymers, dendrimers, and nanoparticles13–17 have
been tested and shown to exert potent virustatic activity in vitro,
none have shown efficacy in humans. The only three polyanionic
anti-HIV-1 microbicides that reached phase III clinical trial—that
is, polysulfonated PRO2000, the polysulfated Carraguard, and cellu-
lose sulfate Ushercell—did not prevent vaginal HIV-1 transmission,
and in some cases even increased the rate of infection18–21. One of
the possible explanations is that their effect was simply virustatic,
and hence vaginal and seminal fluids lead to the dilution of both the
viruses and the active compounds, which resulted in the complete
loss of binding and release of active virus.
Arguably, the ideal drug against a viral infection would be
virucidal. Virucidal molecules cause irreversible viral deactivation;
indeed, their effect is retained even if dilution occurs after the
initial interaction with the virus22. There is a vast literature on
many virucidal materials, ranging from simple detergents, to strong
acids, or more refined polymers23, and nanoparticles (NPs)24–27 that,
in some cases, are capable of releasing ions28,29. In all cases, the
approaches utilized have intrinsic cellular toxicity26. Indeed, all of
these materials attempt to chemically damage the virus, but it is a
tall order to selectively damage a virus without affecting its host.
An ideal drug should have all the positive properties of virustatic
drugs such as broad-spectrum efficacy and low toxicity, and at the
same time show a virucidal mechanism. In this paper, we show
that it is possible to change the mechanism of inhibition of an
antiviral nanoparticle from virustatic to virucidal by engineering its
linkers in a way that we hypothesize leads to multivalent binding
with the consequent generation of irreversible local distortion,
as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1a. Most VALs have binding
domains composed of closely packed repeating units; hence they
are ideally suited for multivalent binding to their cell receptor.
All the known HSPG-mimicking NPs, polymers and dendrimers15
display short linkers to expose sulfonate groups to the viral ligands,
including gold NPs coated with 3-mercaptoethylsulfonate (MES)16
and heparin. The relative rigidity of the sulfonate linkers should
reasonably lead to the binding of only a few of the repeating units
that constitute a VAL. Consequently, the resulting binding is weak
and reversible30,31. On the other hand, it is known30,31 that particles,
when binding strongly to a membrane, can lead to significant local
distortions. Hence, we replace the short linkers in MES-NPs with
long ones, to achieve strong multivalent binding. We show here that
strong multivalent binding leads to local distortions and eventually
to a global virus deformation, with the consequent irreversible
loss of infectivity. We compare MES-coated gold NPs, as well as
heparin, with a series of NPs coated with undecanesulfonic acid
(MUS)-containing ligands. All NPs show in vitro inhibition of many
HSPG-dependent viruses, either enveloped (HSV, RSV, lentivirus
and dengue virus) or naked (HPV). But whereas the effect of the
MES-NPs and heparin is lost upon dilution, all MUS-coated NPs
show a clear irreversible effect. As expected the ‘upgrade’ from a
virustatic to a virucidal mechanism adds, to all of the positive traits
of the former, a strong effect ex vivo on human cervicovaginal
histocultures infected by HSV-2 that is absent in the parental
virustatic drugs and a strong effect in vivo in mice infected with RSV.
Virus and nanoparticles description
To evaluate the inhibitory activity of our NPs we used the
following viruses: HSV type 1 (HSV-1), HSV type 2 (HSV-2),
pseudoviruses of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16), RSV,
vescicular stomatitis virus pseudo-typed lentivirus (LV-VSV-G) and
dengue virus. All of the viruses above are HSPG-dependent viruses.
We used adenovirus-5 (AD5), a non-HSPG-dependent virus, as a
control. To mimic HSPG, we prepared NPs coated with MES and
NPs coated with MUS. MES-NPs are reported in the literature and
are supposed to be virustatic—that is, the sulfonic acid moieties at
the end of their short linkers are effective mimics of HSPG and as
a consequence they show good efficacy against a number of HSPG-
dependent viruses. The postulated mechanism of virus binding to
HSPGs is reversible in nature. To render it irreversible we chose
to replace MES with MUS, as this ligand has a long hydrophobic
backbone terminating with a sulfonic acid, allowing its terminal
group to move with some freedom. Consequently, NPs coated with
MUS are ideal for multivalent binding, in this case the binding of
multiple sulfonic acids to the HSPG-interacting motifs on the virus
surface. Gold NPs coated with MUS ligands were selected, as they
are the simplest non-toxic particles that can be synthesized with
these ligands. Additional NPs selected in the present study are the
particles coated with a 2:1 mixture of MUS and 1-octanethiol (OT),
as they are the most biocompatible, soluble, and resistant to protein
non-specific adsorption version of MUS-coated gold particles that
we have studied32–35. All NPs used are summarized in Table 1, and
all synthetic methods and characterizations are presented in the
Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Figs 1 to 7.
Viral inhibition
Each virus was pre-incubated with different doses of gold
NPs for 1 h at 37 ◦C and 5% CO2; then the mixture was
added to the cell culture (see Supplementary Methods for
virus-specific protocol details, initial viral load, and cell types),
and infectivity was tested 24–72 h post-infection. For the GFP-
expressing viruses (LV-VSV-G, AD-5 and HPV-16) the infectivity
was quantified by flow cytometry, whereas plaque assays were
used for wild-type viruses. Table 2 summarizes the results. It is
noteworthy that the MUS-functionalized NPs are indeed non-toxic
at these concentrations showing favourable selectivity indexes, are
able to inhibit infection selectively for HSPG-dependent viruses
since no inhibition is observed for AD5, and that all EC50 are in
the nanomolar range (see Supplementary Methods for calculations
of moles of NP). It is important to underline that the monomeric
sulfonated ligand (MUS molecule) was not effective in inhibiting
LV-VSV-G (Supplementary Fig. 8). One possible explanation for
the lack of inhibition for the MUS molecule could be interactions
between various chemical groups on the surface of viruses with the
thiols at the end of the ligands. We believe that this explanation is
not the correct one, as no inhibitory activity of sodium undec-10-
enesulfonate (pre-MUS), a molecule equivalent to MUS but lacking
the thiol end-group, was detected against any of the viruses tested.

similar size, ligand- and charge-density to the MUS-NPs but
replacing the sulfonate with phosphonate groups. In contrast
to the MUS-NPs, the MUP-NPs showed no inhibitory activity
when mixed with pseudo-lentivirus (LV-VSV-G), highlighting the
importance of the sulfonic acid group for the activity of the particles.
Finally, no inhibitory activity of 15-nm-diameter citrate-coated

experiments aimed at establishing that the particles actually do
target the HSPG-seeking VAL.
Virucidal testing
As explained above, other sulfonated materials16–19 have also shown
similar inhibitory effects as shown for MUS-NPs in Table 2, but
these effects have been proven10,11 or are assumed36 to be virustatic
and hence due to reversible attachment alone. To test whether a
different inhibition mechanism was in place for our particles, we
first verified the ability of our NPs to inhibit viral attachment, as
is known for heparin (Supplementary Fig. 9). Then, we verified
the ability of MUS:OT-NPs, MES-NPs, and heparin to inhibit viral
infection. The results are shown in the blue curves in Fig. 1b
and summarized in Table 1. In all cases we observed EC50 in
similar ranges. The inhibition assays were completed by standard
toxicity tests. The orange points plotted in Fig. 1b illustrate the
results of cell viability studies. In all three cases no toxic effect
was observed even at the highest concentrations. We then tested
them for irreversible inhibitory activity through virucidal assays.
These assays consist of an incubation of the virus and drugs at
a concentration corresponding to the EC90 for a given amount of
time and the subsequent evaluation of the residual infectivity of
the virus through serial dilutions of the inoculum. It is known19

that if the effect is solely virustatic, the viral infectivity is fully
recovered upon dilution, as we show here for heparin and MES
gold NPs against HSV-2 (Fig. 1b). As expected in both cases we
found these particles to have inhibitory activity in the nanomolar
range16, but virucidal tests showed recovery of the viral infectivity,
indicating a simple virustatic inhibitory mechanism. If irreversible
changes are induced in the virus particle, the infectivity is never
regained at any dilutions tested, even though the dilution leads to a

final concentration lower than the active dose22. MUS:OT-NPs also
showed nanomolar inhibition of HSV-2 infectivity but, in contrast
to heparin and MES-NPs, no infectivity was regained upon dilution
(Fig. 1b), confirming an irreversible effect (virucidal). In agreement
with our hypothesis, all HSPG-binding viruses showed irreversible
loss of infectivity when incubated with MUS:OT-NPs, although to
differing extents (Fig. 1c).
The HSV-2 virucidal tests were performed also at different
time points, as shown in Fig. 1d. Whereas the virustatic effect is
immediate, as shown by the dose response curve at time 0 h in
Supplementary Fig. 10, the virucidal activity develops over time,
with the effect being almost complete after 30 min. Indeed, when
viruses and MUS:OT-NPs were mixed and immediately added to
cells, the inhibitory potency is reduced as compared to the pre-
incubation experiment, confirming the time-dependent virucidal
effect (Supplementary Fig. 10).
NPs-induction of irreversible changes in the virus particles
To elucidate the fate of the viruses after NPs binding we performed
a series of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies on
HSV-2 exposed to MUS:OT-NPs and MES-NPs. Dry uranyl acetate
negatively stained TEM were complemented by cryo-TEM studies
(see Supplementary Discussion for the choice of imaging and its
validity). Figure 2a shows negative staining TEM and Fig. 2b,c
shows cryo-TEM images of viruses with and without NPs. It is
possible to see different types of NP–virus association, categorized as
follows: virus with no NPs associated (stage 1); virus with some NPs
associated—that is, with particles being mostly isolated (stage 2);
virus with NPs associated with at least one local cluster of NPs
(stage 3); and deformed viruses mostly covered with NPs (stage 4).
We believe that stage 2 indicates that NPs have associated with the
HSPG VALs; as time progresses the VAL attracts more particles
leading to stage 3, forming NPs clusters; stage 4 is when the particles
are associated with a broken virus or break the virus. Control
experiments with particles that had no sulfonic acids show mostly
stage 1, and in some rare cases stage 2, that we attribute to stochastic
interactions (Supplementary Fig. 11).
The quantification of cryo-TEM images illustrated in Fig. 2d
shows that, immediately after mixing HSV-2 with MES-NPs
(0.2 mg ml−1, approximate incubation time of 30 s), 75% of the
viruses do not show any association with the NPs (stage 1), whereas
25% are associated with the particles (stage 2 and 3). For stage 2
and 3 we observed association primarily at a single point. After
90 min of incubation at 37 ◦C, 5% CO2, we find that the fractions of
stage 1 versus NP-associated stages remain practically unchanged.
The only noticeable difference we found is that the fraction of
viruses that was previously in stage 2 now is in stage 3, with
5% showing stage 4 deformed viruses fully coated with NPs. Our
interpretation of this data is that in MES-NPs we observe an overall
sporadic sizeable interaction with the VAL, leading to a progression
from stage 2 to stage 3, while the fraction in stage 4 provides us
with a baseline to determine the fraction in our samples of deformed
viruses that have lost their capsid integrity and become coated with
NPs.
At the same concentration as MES-NPs, the effect of MUS:OT-
NPs is markedly different. In this case, all viruses immediately

HSPG-binding residues of L1 (K278, K356, K361, K54 and K59) are shown in blue. Inset highlights the strong selective coupling between sulfonate groups
and HSPG-binding residues (K356, K361, K54 and K59). b, Schematic diagram illustrates how strong multi-site binding of MUS-type NPs to HSPG-binding

associate with particles, showing 50% of stage 2 and 20% of stage 3,
and already 30% of the viruses are deformed and fully coated stage 4.
After 90 min, images show an evolution of the interaction, as only
13% of the viruses remain in stage 2 and the other 87% are deformed
and fully coated stage 4.
In our interpretation, stage 2 and 3 are the imaging of a virustatic
effect, as they show NPs attached to viruses, whereas stage 4 is
related to the virucidal effect, as it images viruses fully covered
with NPs that most probably have lost their structural integrity.
When comparing the images for MES-NPs and viruses with those
for MUS:OT-NPs and viruses it is noticeable that the immediate
association suggests stronger interaction with MUS:OT-NPs, as
images lack stage 1. While comparison of the images obtained at
90 min indicates that MUS:OT-NPs induce damage to a fraction
of the viruses that is significantly higher than what is observed for
MES-NPs (87% versus 5%, respectively). Moreover, image analysis
leads to the conclusion that the virucidal action of the MUS:OT-NPs
is progressive with time, as established also with virucidal assays
(Fig. 1d), because the fraction of viruses imaged in stage 2 and 3
progressively evolves into stage 4. A similar progression can be
observed with HPV-16 (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Mechanistic understanding via simulations
To understand how MUS-type NPs can induce irreversible changes
upon interaction with HSPG-VALs, we performed atomistic molec-
ular dynamics (MD) simulations of different NPs interacting with
the capsid of HPV-16 (Fig. 3). The simulations were performed in
physiological solutions, where NPs were placed close to the solvent-
exposed HSPG-binding sites (amino acid residues K278, K356,
K361, K54 and K59)37,38 at the surface of HPV-16 capsid L1 proteins.
The simulation results for MUS:OT-NP 2.4 nm cores, with two
types of ligands (MUS and OT) in their ligand shell, 50:50 in compo-
sition, are shown in Fig. 3a (Supplementary Movie 1). They demon-
strate that selective multivalent binding39 develops between the
negative sulfonate groups of MUS:OT-NP and the positive HSPG-
binding lysine residues of L1 capsid protein complexes from the
HPV-16 capsid. Within 50–80 ns, on average 5–6 local charge inter-
actions form between NP terminal sulfonate groups and L1 HSPG-
binding sites (Supplementary Figs 13 and 14), which are supported
by a similar number of non-local coupling contacts between non-
polar alkyl chains of NP ligands and L1 proteins. Each of the 5–6
sulfonate groups binds to positively charged amine groups of lysine
residues with a relatively large Gibbs free energy of −6 kcal mol−1
(ref. 40), totalling in �Gbind∼−34 kcal mol−1, while the non-polar
ligand chains acquire on average a non-local total binding energy of
−21 kcal mol−1 (see Supplementary Methods for details).
This multivalent binding can induce large stresses and defor-
mations of the L1 complexes. Given the local nature of binding
of the sulfonated groups, we can use this binding to estimate the
effective force with which the NPs act on the L1 complexes. By
considering the increase of binding energy, �Gbind, during the NP
motion, �x, on the capsid surface, we can get an effective force that
drives the NP binding and capsid deformation process forwards,
F ∼ −�Gbind//�x (Fig. 3b). By combining the above Coulombic
energy change of �Gbind ∼−28 kcal mol−1 and considering, at the
beginning of simulations, NP interacting with a lysine, with a dis-
tance of 10.4 Å over which the MUS:OT-NP moves (Supplementary
Fig. 15), while acquiring this binding energy, we obtain an effective
force of F ∼189 pN. This force can deform the L1 complexes and
even disturb the relative position of one L1 pentamer with respect
to a neighbouring L1 pentamer (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 16
and Supplementary Movie 2). This disruption of viral capsids by
NPs with a multivalent Coulombic binding is analogous to pore
formation in neutral membranes by Ca2+ ions41. See Supplementary
Discussion for the effect of length on the sulfonated ligand.
Ex vivo activity
To develop an effective antiviral strategy the active substances have
to act mainly after infection. We verified whether MUS:OT-NPs
were effective also after virus infection of cells. Cells were infected
with wild-type HSV-2 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01
plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell for 2 h at 37 ◦C. After removal
of the viral inoculum, different doses of MUS:OT-NPs were added
to the cell monolayers immediately, or after 2, 4 or 24 h. Cells and
supernatants were harvested when the untreated wells exhibited a
cytopathic effect of the whole monolayer. The cell-free supernatants

of 5 BALB/c mice were treated at day 0 with either 50 µl of PBS or MUS:OT-NPs in PBS (50 µl at 200 µg ml−1) and 10 min later where inoculated with
RSV-Luc, with the exception of the mock group. Bioluminescence was measured at day 3 post-infection by intranasal injection of D-luciferin. Capture of
photon emission was performed using the IVIS system. Luciferase activities were quantified for each mouse using Living Image software. Luciferase activity
is expressed as photons per second (p s−1). Results are the mean and s.e.m. of three independent experiments performed with 5 mice per group.

were then titrated. We determined that MUS:OT-NPs had an EC50
of 4.4 µg ml−1, with complete inhibition at 400 µg ml−1 and a 3 logs
reduction at 80 µg ml−1 (Supplementary Fig. 17), and a relevant
inhibition of infection in all the tested time points. Thus, the NPs
can either prevent infection or block an ongoing infectious process,
depending on whether they inactivate the virus inoculum or the
viral progeny.
To further verify the increased activity of our NPs in a model
similar to an in vivo infection, we performed antiviral assays in Epi-
Vaginal tissues. These are composed of human-derived ectocervical
epithelial cells grown on a collagen-coated membrane to form a
multilayered and highly differentiated tissue that is similar to the
vaginal mucosa. We used HSV-2 as a challenge due to its specific
tropism for the genital mucosa. HSV-2 (105PFU) was pre-incubated
with the NPs at 500 nM and then applied to tissues for 2 h at
37 ◦C. The tissues were washed apically every day and the viral titre
was evaluated by titration. The results show a significantly better
profile of inhibition of the MUS:OT-NPs compared to the MES-NPs
(Fig. 4a). Moreover, we performed experiments in EpiVaginal tissues
also pre-treating the tissues for 18 h and subsequently infecting with
HSV-2 or infecting the tissue with HSV-2 and treating 24 hours post
infection. In both experiments we could observe a significant inhi-
bition with MUS:OT-NPs (Fig. 4b,c) confirming the preventive and
therapeutic activity of MUS:OT-NPs observed in cell lines. More-
over, the nanoparticles proved to be non-toxic in MTT and LDH
assays conducted on EpiVaginal tissues (Supplementary Fig. 18),
demonstrating their biocompatibility with a human mucosa.
In vivo activity
To provide the proof of concept that MUS:OT-NPs could exert
inhibitory activity also in vivo, we tested them in Balb/c mice
infected with RSV42. Three groups of 5 BALB/c mice were treated at
day 0 with 50 µl of PBS, 50 µl of PBS, or MUS:OT-NPs in PBS (50 µl
at 200 µg ml−1) in the latter two cases this was followed, 10 min later,
by inoculation with RSV-Luc (104 PFU). Three days post-infection
the luciferase expression in the lungs was analysed as a measure of
the extent of infection. As shown in Fig. 4d,e, untreated mice show
a clear pulmonary dissemination of RSV infection. By contrast,
the luciferase signal from the lungs of the MUS:OT-NPs-treated
group was found to be statistically identical to the noise level set
by the signal of uninfected mice treated solely with a PBS solution,
indicating that MUS:OT-NPs treatment prevented the pulmonary
dissemination of the infection.
Moreover, to investigate the biodistribution of MUS:OT-NPs,
organ homogenates were subjected to inductively coupled mass
spectrometry (ICP-MS) where it was possible to detect presence of
gold only in lung homogenates, whereas there was no detectable
signal from spleen, liver and brain (Supplementary Fig. 19). Of note,
the localization of the MUS:OT-NPs is consistent with their antiviral
activity in the lungs, as shown in Fig. 4d,e.
Conclusions
We believe that the approach presented here has a chance to
produce medically relevant virucidal drugs to fight viral infections.
See Supplementary Discussion for the extension of this work
to biodegradable nanoparticles. The results found so far show
outstanding virucidal activity over HSV-2 and LS-VSV-G, whereas
the activity versus HPV and RSV, although remarkable, should
be improved. In any case, it should be stressed that the strategy
proposed is intrinsically broad spectrum, allowing the potential
prevention and treatment of multiple viral infections with a single
drug, a great advantage mostly in virology, where rapid and at

times unexpected infections occur. For example, West Nile, yellow
fever, and dengue are growing threats. All these viruses belong to
the Flaviviridae family, and are HSPG-binding viruses. Preliminary
results with gold NPs show nanomolar virucidal efficacy over
dengue 2 (see Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 20). Similarly,
the Filoviridae family contains several human pathogens causing
haemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola virus, for which drugs are
urgently needed. All bind HSPGs as attachment receptors, and
are potentially susceptible to the antiviral NPs presented in this
study. Overall, what is presented here is a first step towards the
development of treatments for many worldwide threatening viral
infections. Further in-depth in vivo experimentations will be needed
to determine whether prophylactic or therapeutic uses of this
discovery will be appropriate.

Methods
Detailed procedures are provided in the Methods section of the Supplementary
Information
Nanoparticles synthesis. MUS:OT and all MUS nanoparticles were synthesized
using a slightly modified procedure reported in ref. 43. All MES Au nanoparticles
were synthesized following the synthetic procedure reported in ref. 15.
Viral inhibition. Viruses were pre-incubated with nanoparticles for 1 h and then
added on cells. Viral infection was evaluated through plaque assay or flow
cytometry.
Virucidal assays. Viruses (104–106 PFU) and 100 to 1,000 µg ml−1 of MUS:OT-NPs
were incubated at different time points at 37 ◦C and the virucidal effect was
investigated with serial dilutions of the mixtures. Viral titres were calculated at
dilutions at which the NPs were not effective.
TEM and cryo-TEM. HSV-2 and HPV-PsV (105 PFU) were incubated with or
without 100 µg ml−1 Au-NPs and were adsorbed on carbon- and Formvar-coated
grids, negatively stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate, and observed with a CM 10
electron microscope. For cryo-TEM, viruses and NPs were flash-frozen in their
native hydrated state on carbon-coated grids and imaged at −175 ◦C in a FEI
Tecnai F20 Cryo 200 kV TEM.
Ex vivo analysis. Epivaginal tissues were purchased from Mattek and cultured as
indicated by the manufacturer. The tissues were infected with HSV-2 (104–105
PFU), treated with different NPs (500–1,500 nM), and titrations of supernatants
were conducted on Vero cells to evaluate viral replication.
In vivo analysis. Balb/c mice were treated with 200 µg ml−1 of MUS:OT-NPs and
then infected with RSV-Luc as previously described42. Luminescence was measured
using the IVIS 200 imaging system (Xenogen Corp.).
Statistics. All results are presented as the mean values and s.e.m. from three
independent experiments. The EC50 values for inhibition curves were calculated by
regression analysis with GraphPad Prism. The selectivity indexes (SI) were
calculated by dividing the CC50 for the EC50. A unpaired t-test analysis was
performed for virucidal assays and in vivo assays. t values and degrees of freedom
(df) are indicated in figure legends.
