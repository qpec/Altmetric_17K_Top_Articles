IMPORTANCE Positive associations between inflammatory biomarkers and risk of psychiatric
disorders, including schizophrenia, have been reported in observational studies. However,
conventional observational studies are prone to bias, such as reverse causation and residual
confounding, thus limiting our understanding of the effect (if any) of inflammatory
biomarkers on schizophrenia risk.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether inflammatory biomarkers have an effect on the risk of
developing schizophrenia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-sample mendelian randomization study using
genetic variants associated with inflammatory biomarkers as instrumental variables to
improve inference. Summary association results from large consortia of candidate gene or
genome-wide association studies, including several epidemiologic studies with different
designs, were used. Gene-inflammatory biomarker associations were estimated in pooled
samples ranging from 1645 to more than 80 000 individuals, while gene-schizophrenia
associations were estimated in more than 30 000 cases and more than 45 000
ancestry-matched controls. In most studies included in the consortia, participants were of
European ancestry, and the prevalence of men was approximately 50%. All studies were
conducted in adults, with a wide age range (18 to >80 years).
EXPOSURES Genetically elevated circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1
receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), and soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of developing schizophrenia. Individuals with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders were included as cases. Given that many studies
contributed to the analyses, different diagnostic procedures were used.
RESULTS The pooled odds ratio estimate using 18 CRP genetic instruments was 0.90 (random
effects 95% CI, 0.84-0.97; P = .005) per 2-fold increment in CRP levels; consistent results
were obtained using different mendelian randomization methods and a more conservative
set of instruments. The odds ratio for sIL-6R was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P = .02) per 2-fold
increment. Estimates for IL-1Ra were inconsistent among instruments, and pooled estimates
were imprecise and centered on the null.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Under mendelian randomization assumptions, our findings
suggest a protective effect of CRP and a risk-increasing effect of sIL-6R (potentially mediated
at least in part by CRP) on schizophrenia risk. It is possible that such effects are a result of
increased susceptibility to early life infection.

mune dysregulation plays a role in the pathogenesis of
schizophrenia.9 Inflammation has been hypothesized as a po-
tential mechanism linking the immune response to the patho-
genesis of schizophrenia and other neuropsychiatric disor-
ders because cytokines may influence multiple neurologic
processes, including neurotransmitter metabolism, neuroen-
docrinefunction,andneuralplasticity.4,10-12Observationalepi-
demiologic studies, mainly of cross-sectional design, indi-
cate that circulating levels of several cytokines,13 such as
interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP),14,15
are higher in individuals with schizophrenia. Meta-analysis of
randomized clinical trials suggested that anti-inflammatory
drugs improve the symptoms of the syndrome, but only a few
studies with small sample sizes are available.16

Mendelian randomization has been used to investigate the
effect of circulating CRP levels on schizophrenia risk. In a large,
Danish population-based study using 4 genetic instruments
in the CRP gene region, the point estimate suggested a risk-
increasing effect, but the lower limit of the 95% CIs did not al-
low excluding the possibility of important protective effects.21
Two subsequent studies, both using the same summary asso-
ciation data sets in a 2-sample MR design, reported direction-
ally inconsistent estimates,22,23 likely due to a data harmoni-
zation error in 1 of them.24 Moreover, neither of the 2-sample
MR studies performed substantial sensitivity analyses.
We conducted this study to investigate the effect of in-
flammatory markers on schizophrenia risk in a 2-sample MR
design. We used genetic variants associated with inflamma-
tory biomarkers as instrumental variables to improve infer-
ence for a possible influence of the inflammatory biomarkers
on risk of developing schizophrenia.25
Methods
Data sets
We obtained summary association results for 4 sets of genetic
instruments:liberalCRP(instrumentsselectedusingsolelysta-
tistical criteria26), conservative CRP (instruments restricted to
the CRP gene region27), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
(IL-1Ra),28 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R).29 Sum-
mary associations between each instrument and schizophre-
nia risk were obtained from the largest schizophrenia genome-
wideassociationstudytodate.9TheeMethodsintheSupplement
provides a description of each data set. Briefly, summary asso-
ciationresultsfromlargeconsortiaofcandidategeneorgenome-
wide association studies were included. Gene-biomarker asso-
ciationswereestimatedinpooledsamplesrangingfrom1645to
more than 80 000 individuals, while gene-schizophrenia asso-
ciations were estimated in more than 30 000 cases and more
than 45 000 ancestry-matched controls. In most studies in-
cluded in the consortia, participants were of European ances-
try,andtheprevalenceofmenwasapproximately50%.Allstud-
ies were conducted in adults, with a wide age range (18 to >80
years). The summary genetic associations data sets were har-
monized as described elsewhere24 and are reported in eTable 1
and eTable 2 in the Supplement. This project used only pub-
licly available summarized (ie, aggregated) results from pub-
lished meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. In-
dividual- and study-level aggregated results were not used.
Statistical Analysis
Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) biomarker associa-
tions were collected in ln-transformed units. Odds ratio (OR)
estimates of schizophrenia per 2-fold increments in circulat-
ing inflammatory biomarker levels were obtained as follows:

Key Points
Question What is the effect of increased inflammatory
biomarkers on the risk of developing schizophrenia?
Findings In this 2-sample mendelian randomization study using
summary gene-biomarker association results estimated in pooled
samples ranging from 1645 to more than 80 000 individuals,
2-fold increments in circulating levels of C-reactive protein and
soluble interleukin-1 receptor levels were associated with a 10%
reduction and a 6% increase in the lifetime odds of developing
schizophrenia.
Meaning We found that blockade of interleukin-6 effects and low
C-reactive protein levels might increase schizophrenia risk,
possibly due to increased susceptibility to early life infection.

 Mendelian randomization requires that the genetic instru-
ments are associated with the modifiable exposure of inter-
est (assumption 1), and any association between the instru-
ments and the outcome is mediated by the exposure
(assumption 2). Given that only assumption 1 is empirically
verifiable, careful consideration of potential violations of as-
sumption 2 (due to factors such as population stratification,
linkage disequilibrium, canalization, or horizontal pleiot-
ropy)isimportanttominimizebias.18AnSNPthatviolatesthese
assumptions is referred to as an invalid instrumental variable
and its inclusion in MR analyses may bias the results.
Five MR methods were used.
1. Ratio method. This method was used to obtain individual
SNP estimates by dividing the SNP schizophrenia by the cor-
responding SNP biomarker effect estimates. Standard er-
rors were estimated using the delta method30 assuming the
uncertainty in the SNP-exposure association estimates was
negligible (the no measurement error [NOME] assump-
tion);thismethodcorrespondstodividing,foreachSNP,the
SE of SNP schizophrenia association by the absolute value
of the SNP biomarker effect estimate. These SEs were then
used to perform weighted analyses using methods 2 to 4.
2. Inverse variance weighting (IVW). The IVW estimate is the
inverse variance weighted mean of ratio estimates from 2
or more instruments.25 This method assumes that all SNPs
are valid instruments or are invalid in such a way that the
overall bias is zero. We performed both fixed and multipli-
cative random effects IVW since the fixed effects method
maybeoverpreciseinthepresenceofheterogeneitythatcan
occur due to, among other factors, horizontal pleiotropy or,
more simply, off-target genetic effects.31
3. Weightedgeneralizedlinearregression.Thismethodissimi-
lar to the IVW method but allows accounting for the corre-
lationbetweenthegeneticinstruments.32Theweightedgen-
eralized linear regression method was used instead of the
IVW method when utilizing the conservative set of CRP ge-
netic instruments, which comprised variants in partial link-
age disequilibrium (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
4. Weighted median. The weighted median estimate is the me-
dian of the weighted empirical distribution function of in-
dividual SNP ratio estimates. It differs from a simple me-
dian estimate because the weight of each SNP in the overall
estimatedependsontheprecisionofitsratioestimate.More
specifically, 50% of the weights in the analysis come from
ratio estimates smaller than or equal to the weighted me-
dian. This method provides a consistent effect estimate if
more than 50% of the information comes from valid SNPs.33
5. Mendelian randomization Egger regression. MR Egger re-
gression consists of a weighted linear regression of SNP
schizophrenia against SNP biomarker effect estimates. As-
suming that horizontal pleiotropic effects and SNP expo-
sure associations are uncorrelated (ie, the instrument
strength independent of direct effects assumption), MR Eg-
gerregressionprovidesavalideffectestimateevenifallSNPs
are invalid instruments. Moreover, the MR Egger intercept
can be interpreted as a test of overall unbalanced horizon-
tal pleiotropy because one would expect a null y-intercept
(ie, the mean value of the SNP schizophrenia associations
when the SNP biomarker association is zero) if there are no
horizontal pleiotropic effects.34 Both fixed and multiplica-
tive random effects versions of the MR Egger regression
method were performed.
Measurement error in the SNP exposure associations (ie,
NOME violation) is always present to some degree. In the
2-sample setting (which is the case in our study), NOME vio-
lation attenuates the effect estimates and also affects MR Eg-
ger regression intercept. The degree of NOME violation in IVW
and MR Egger regression, respectively, can be quantified by
the following statistics35:

GX

Both range from 0% to 100% and can be interpreted as the
amount of attenuation in the effect estimates due to NOME
violations.35,36 Such violations can be accounted for using the
simulationextrapolationmethod,whichwasappliedtoMREg-
ger regression.36
The Cochran Q test for heterogeneity was applied to the
liberal CRP set to test for the presence of horizontal pleiot-
ropy. This test assumes that all valid genetic instruments es-
timate the same effect.37 Moreover, to identify potentially in-
fluential instruments in the liberal CRP set of instruments, we
applied a range of influence tests (described in detail in the
eMethods in the Supplement).38,39 Tests of influence were
complemented by a leave-1-out approach to evaluate the in-
fluence of each SNP.
We used available data on the association between the
sIL-6R genetic instrument and CRP levels29 in a mediation
analysis evaluating the potential mediating effect of CRP in
the association between sIL-6R levels and schizophrenia
risk. We used MR to obtain effect estimates of the exposure-
outcome (ie, sIL-6R levels and schizophrenia risk),
exposure-mediator (ie, sIL-6R levels and CRP levels), and
mediator-outcome (ie, CRP levels and schizophrenia risk)
associations. The exposure-mediator and mediator-outcome
associations can be used to estimate the expected effect of
sIL-6R levels on schizophrenia risk assuming that CRP levels
fully mediate this association. This effect estimate can then
be contrasted to the observed exposure-outcome association
to gain insights into the mediating effect of the putative
mediator (the calculation is described in detail in the
eMethods in the Supplement).40
Analyses were performed using R, version 3.2.4 (http:
//www.r-project.org).
Results
Table 1 displays the association between genetically elevated
inflammatory biomarkers and schizophrenia. Regarding CRP,
when the liberal set of 18 CRP-associated variants was used,
results were consistent among the 3 MR methods, with ORs
of schizophrenia of 0.90 (random effects 95% CI, 0.84-0.97),
0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.98), and 0.93 (random effects 95% CI,
0.82-1.05) per 2-fold increment in circulating CRP levels using

suggest that measurement errors in the SNP CRP associations
were not substantially attenuating the effect estimates. Regu-
lar and simulation extrapolation–corrected MR Egger regres-
sion results were virtually identical, so only the first result was
shown.
The MR Egger intercepts were (when rounding to 2 deci-
mal digits) equal to 1.00 with narrow 95% CIs, suggesting no
strong unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy. However, the Coch-
ran Q statistic was 31.9, with an associated P value of .02, sug-
gesting some heterogeneity in the effect estimates, possibly
due to horizontal pleiotropy.
The results obtained using the conservative CRP set were
consistent with the liberal set. Odds ratio estimates of schizo-
phrenia per 2-fold increment in circulating CRP levels based
on the ratio method ranged from 0.90 (95% CI, 0.79-1.02) to
0.97(95%CI,0.84-1.12).ThepooledORestimatewas0.93(95%
CI, 0.82-1.05). The 2 OR estimates for IL-1Ra were direction-
ally inconsistent (1.02 [95% CI, 0.98-1.07] and 0.98 [95% CI,
0.94-1.01]), with a pooled IVW estimate of 0.99 (random ef-
fects 95% CI, 0.76-1.30). Finally, the OR of schizophrenia per
2-fold increments in circulating sIL-6R levels was 1.06 (95%
CI, 1.01-1.12).
In the leave-1-out MR analyses using the liberal CRP set,
all OR estimates of schizophrenia per 2-fold increment in cir-
culating CRP levels were directionally consistent (Table 2). In-
verse variance weighting, weighted median, and MR Egger re-
gression estimates ranged from 0.88 to 0.91, 0.89 to 0.94, and
0.87 to 0.94, respectively. Conventional statistical signifi-
cance levels were achieved in all IVW estimates and in 16
weighted median estimates but in none of the MR Egger re-
gression estimates. The SNP rs9987289 was the only variant
classified as potentially influential, and its removal had vir-
tually no effect on the results. This single variant accounted
for most of the heterogeneity in the individual instrument ra-
tio estimates (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Therefore, any pos-
siblehorizontalpleiotropysuggestedbytheCochranQtestdoes
not explain our findings.
Using the ratio method, the effect of a 1-unit increase in
ln(sIL-6R) levels (used as a proxy for inhibition of IL-6 classic
signaling) on ln(CRP) levels was −0.26 (95% CI, −0.32 to −0.21),
and the effect of a 1-unit increase in ln(CRP) levels on the ln
(OR) of schizophrenia was −0.14 (95% CI, −0.23 to −0.05). Mul-
tiplying these estimates yielded an OR of schizophrenia of 1.03
(95% CI, 1.01 to 1.04) per 2-fold increment in sIL-6R levels. The
estimated proportion of the effect of inhibiting IL-6 classic sig-
naling on schizophrenia risk that is mediated by CRP (using the
IVW estimate from the liberal CRP set as the effect estimate
of CRP on schizophrenia risk) was 43.8% (95% CI, 3.3% to
84.2%).
Discussion
We used 2-sample MR to evaluate the association between in-
flammatory biomarkers and schizophrenia. Overall, we did not
find strong evidence that lifelong exposure to increased ac-
tion of these proinflammatory cytokines increases schizophre-
nia risk, as previously hypothesized, and, conversely, found

 that blockade of IL-6 effects and low CRP levels might in-
stead increase schizophrenia risk. Moreover, part of the asso-
ciationbetweenIL-6signalingandschizophreniamightbeme-
diated by CRP levels, which is consistent with previous
knowledge on the major role of IL-6 in inducing acute-phase
response and the fact that lower CRP levels are a downstream
effectofinhibitingIL-6classicsignaling.26,41,42ForIL-1Ra,point
estimateswereinconsistentbetweeninstruments,and95%CIs
were large. Our study extends previous MR findings by evalu-
ating different inflammatory markers and applying a range of
sensitivity analyses.
Interleukin-6 is known for its pivotal role in integrating im-
mune response, such as by inducing hepatic acute-phase pro-
teins,differentiationofTcells,andtissueregeneration.43Apart
from being a sensitive marker of systemic inflammation and
tissue damage, CRP is an acute-phase protein that contrib-
utes to host defense against infection.44 C-reactive protein
binds to phosphocholine expressed on the surface of cells and
some bacteria, which activates the complement system, pro-
moting phagocytosis and clearance of necrotic and apoptotic
cells and bacteria.44,45
MechanismsunderlyingtheassociationofblockadeofIL-6
classic signaling and lower CRP levels with increased risk of
schizophrenia are unknown. We speculate that they relate to
increased susceptibility to early life infection. Blockade of IL-6
classic signaling leads to increased susceptibility to infec-
tions in mice46 and humans.43 Observational studies indicate
that low levels of some acute-phase proteins in newborns were
related to higher schizophrenia risk47 and that neonates who
develop schizophrenia later in life have an impaired capacity
of increasing levels of acute-phase proteins, such as CRP, in
response to some maternal infections compared with
controls.48 In adults, prospective studies indicate that higher
CRP levels are related to increased susceptibility to
infections.49,50 However, these findings should be inter-
preted cautiously as higher CRP levels may reflect subclinical
infection,chronicactivationoftheinflammatoryresponse,pre-
existing disease, and socioeconomic or lifestyle characteris-
tics. As an example, several types of infection (ie, HIV as well
as hepatitis A, B, and C) appear to be more prevalent among
individuals with mental disorders, including schizophrenia,
in multiple settings.51 An MR study reported that genetic pre-
disposition to higher CRP levels was not associated with in-
creased infection risk in adults.50 To our knowledge, no ex-
isting MR study has investigated IL-6 and CRP effects on early
life infection risk.
Causal inference from MR relies on some assumptions, 1
of them being that the exposure completely mediates any as-
sociation between the instruments and the outcome. Most of
the genetic instruments that we used have biological justifi-
cations for their selection, except for the liberal CRP set of 18
variants. Half of the variants in the liberal CRP set have been
associated with 1 or more of 10 tested cardiometabolic phe-
notypes,whiletheothervariantswerenot.Amongthefirsthalf
of the variants, 6 (or other variants indexing the same locus)
were associated with CRP levels independently of their asso-
ciation with cardiometabolic phenotypes, which was not the
case for the remaining 3 variants.42 Although these findings
suggestthattheCRP-associatedSNPsintheliberalsetarepleio-
tropic, our results based on these variants were consistent
among the 3 MR methods (which have different assumptions
regarding horizontal pleiotropy) and were corroborated by the
results for the conservative CRP set and the leave-1-out analy-
sis. The latter is also important because the liberal CRP set in-
cluded the IL-6R variant rs4129267, which was not used as a
genetic instrument for IL-6 classic signaling but might never-
theless influence it. Moreover, previous studies using the con-
servative CRP set, the IL-R1a, and the IL-6R instruments ob-
served that, in general, those variants are not associated with
conventional confounders.27,29,52

 thesameorcomparablepopulations.Regardingpower,although
some SNP biomarker associations were estimated in small
samples,thestatisticalevidenceforassociationinsuchdatasets
was generally strong. Moreover, power in the 2-sample setting
depends more on the precision of the SNP outcome than on the
SNPexposureassociation,25andSNPschizophreniaassociations
were estimated in approximately 80 000 individuals.
Limitations
Interpreting the magnitude of estimates for the effect of CRP
and IL-6 on schizophrenia risk, as well as for the mediated ef-
fect of IL-6 by circulating CRP, requires caution. Our MR analy-
sis likely reflects lifelong exposure to elevated cytokine and
CRP levels. However, it is possible that only exposure to IL-6
and CRP in a specific window of time (eg, early life) affects
schizophrenia risk. We obtained estimates for the SNP-
cytokines and SNP-CRP associations from adults, but these as-
sociations might differ in early life. In addition, we used esti-
mates for the effect of the IL-6R genetic instrument on sIL-6R
as a proxy to investigate the total and the indirect (mediated
by CRP) effect of blocking IL-6 classic signaling. However, this
genetic instrument affects IL-6 classic signaling by increas-
ing cleavage of membrane-bound IL-6R, which results in lower
availability of membrane-bound IL-6R and higher availabil-
ity of sIL-6R. Both mechanisms are likely to contribute to in-
hibiting IL-6 classic signaling.43 Finally, it is possible that IL-6
and CRP effects on schizophrenia risk are related to a mater-
naleffect(eg,maternalsusceptibilitytoinfectionsduringpreg-
nancy), so that our findings are explained by the correlation
between maternal and offspring genotypes. Because mater-
nal and offspring genotypes are correlated, any effect of in-
trauterine exposures or maternal behavior influenced by the
mother’
s genetic background would also result in an associa-
tion between the offspring’s genotype and risk of
schizophrenia.53
Conclusions
Our findings support the notion that lower CRP levels and
blockade of IL-6 cell signaling—both associated with lower in-
flammation and acute phase response—increase schizophre-
nia risk. This finding suggests that the positive associations of
CRP and IL-6 with schizophrenia risk in conventional obser-
vational studies are due to limitations, such as reverse causa-
tion or residual confounding. Even though our findings could
be a result of horizontal pleiotropy that we failed to detect and
account for, they at least suggest that increased levels of in-
flammatory biomarkers do not lead to substantially higher
schizophrenia risk.
