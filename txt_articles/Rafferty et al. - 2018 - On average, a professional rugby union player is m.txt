Objectives To investigate concussion injury rates, 
the likelihood of sustaining concussion relative to 
the number of rugby union matches and the risk of 
subsequent injury following concussion.
Methods A four-season (2012/2013–2015/2016) 
prospective cohort study of injuries in professional 
level (club and international) rugby union. Incidence 
(injuries/1000 player-match-hours), severity (days lost per 
injury) and number of professional matches conferring 
a large risk of concussion were determined. The risk of 
injury following concussion was assessed using a survival 
model.
results Concussion incidence increased from 7.9 (95% 
CI 5.1 to 11.7) to 21.5 injuries/1000 player-match-
hours (95% CI 16.4 to 27.6) over the four seasons 
for combined club and international rugby union. 
Concussion severity was unchanged over time (median: 
9 days). Players were at a greater risk of sustaining a 
concussion than not after an exposure of 25 matches 
(95% CI 19 to 32). Injury risk (any injury) was 38% 
greater (HR 1.38; 95% CI 1.21 to 1.56) following 
concussion than after a non-concussive injury. Injuries 
to the head and neck (HR 1.34; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.70), 
upper limb (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.19 to 2.12), pelvic region 
(HR 2.07; 95% CI 1.18 to 3.65) and the lower limb (HR 
1.60; 95% CI 1.21 to 2.10) were more likely following 
concussion than after a non-concussive injury.
Conclusion Concussion incidence increased, while 
severity remained unchanged, during the 4 years of this 
study. Playing more than 25 matches in the 2015/2016 
season meant that sustaining concussion was more 
likely than not sustaining concussion. The 38% greater 
injury risk after concussive injury (compared with non-
concussive injury) suggests return to play protocols 
warrant investigation.
InTrOduCTIOn
A high proportion of professional rugby union 
players sustain multiple injuries over consecutive 
seasons.1 Of the common injuries, concussion has 
the highest match injury incidence, with the English 
Rugby Football Union (RFU) reporting a rate of 
15.8/1000 player-match-hours in 2015/2016.2 This 
contrasts with earlier injury surveillance in 2006 
reporting concussion incidence to be 1.4/1000 play-
er-match-hours within South African professional 
rugby union,3 and a mean incidence of 4.7/1000 
player-match-hours cited in a 2014 worldwide 
rugby union injury meta-analysis.4 However, the 
low injury incidence in earlier years may represent 
under-reporting, meaning recent injury data from 
2012 onwards could provide better estimates of 
true concussion incidence due to the roll-out of the 
Head Injury Assessment and concussion education 
programmes.5 
At the professional level, injury risk also appears 
to vary between club and international rugby union, 
with international match incidence being twice that 
of club rugby.6 Yet, no study has directly compared 
injury rates that include data from players who are 
involved with both the international and club levels, 
while also ensuring similar injury surveillance meth-
odology. Additionally, recent RFU injury data indi-
cate that concussion incidence has been increasing 
at club level over recent years, but injury severity 
appears to have remained relatively unchanged.2 
However, this longitudinal data source has not yet 
been assessed at the international level.
Concussion was associated with 60% risk of 
subsequent injury (of any type) in rugby union7 and 
50% in association football (soccer),8 in addition 
to a greater risk of sustaining lower limb injuries 
in college-level contact sports.9 10 Subsequent inju-
ries also occur more quickly following a concus-
sion than a non-concussive injury.7 However, it is 
not known what tissue types and body areas are at 
increased risk in rugby union.
The aims of this study were to: (1) determine 
whether the incidence and severity of concussion 
have changed over the surveillance period in club 
and international rugby union; (2) quantify the 
likelihood of a player sustaining concussion rela-
tive to the number of rugby union matches; (3) 
establish whether concussion is associated with an 
increased risk of subsequent injury in professional 
rugby union; and (4) examine if concussion confers 
greater risk of specific types of subsequent injury.
MeThOds
data collection
The Welsh Rugby Union injury surveillance 
programme has established an injury database 
collected from the Wales senior men’s international 
team and the four professional Welsh rugby clubs 
(Cardiff Blues, Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets) for 
the 4 
years spanning the 2012/2013–2015/2016 
seasons. Ethics approval was obtained from the 
Cardiff Metropolitan University School of Sport 
Ethics Committee and informed consent was 
obtained from players involved in the first team 
squads each season. The teams’ physiotherapist 
recorded all time loss injuries during each season

and submitted injury records at the end of each month, or end of 
each tournament in the case of the international team, to Cardiff 
Metropolitan University (ISM). Any discrepancies in injury 
records were immediately checked and reconfirmed following 
the submission of the data to the independent researcher. For 
the purpose of this study, only injuries sustained during matches 
were used for calculations of incidence, severity and subse-
quent injury risk, with all other time loss presented to provide a 
contextual understanding.
The injury definition and data collection procedures complied 
with the international consensus of injury surveillance in rugby 
union.11 Injuries were coded using the Orchard Sports Injury 
Classification System V
.10.12 Additionally, each injury included 
information about the activity at time of injury (eg, match/
training, contact/non-contact), mode of onset and number of 
days lost per injury. Exposure was calculated by assuming each 
match lasted 80 
min and each team consisted of 15 players. 
Occurrences where players were withdrawn due to injury or foul 
play (yellow/red cards) leaving fewer than 15 players per team in 
play were not accounted for.
Incidence and severity
Injury frequency for concussion sustained during matches was 
characterised by injury incidence, which is the mean number of 
concussions sustained in 1000 player-match-hours. Incidences 
were calculated for club and international teams separately, and 
collectively by combining the club and international injuries and 
exposure. To compare two injury incidences a rate ratio (RR) 
was calculated. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated 
using normal distribution, since the log of the ratio of two inci-
dence rates is normal. T
wo incidences were significantly different 
if the 95% 
CI for the RR did not intersect with unity.
Injury severity refers to the number of days lost of training and 
match play due to an injury. The distribution of injury days lost 
was found to be skewed and did not fit well to any probability 
distribution so the median was used to represent days lost. The 
positive (right) skewness originates from most injuries resolving 
in a relatively short time, with a small number of injuries 
requiring longer recoveries. Uncertainties for injury severity 
were calculated using bootstrapping.13 Comparison of severity 
distributions was done using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov two-sample 
test. A weighted linear least squares fit was used to determine 
whether incidence and severity changed over time. Weights for 
the fit were taken to be the reciprocal of the size of the 95% CI, 
meaning points with narrower CIs were weighted more highly.
Injury risk
The standard metric used to report injury incidence is the 
number of injuries per 1000 player-match-hours. This metric 
allows comparisons to be made across different sporting popu-
lations, but it is difficult to infer specific player risk. Therefore, 
the incidence was used to calculate the risk of injury to a single 
player. The metric used to quantify the risk was the number of 
matches required for an injury to be more likely than not. The 
formula used to compute this quantity was:
 
P(n) = e−nλ1 
where n is the number of player matches and λ1 is the inci-
dence of an injury per player match, that is, 80 player-minutes 
of exposure (see online supplementary 1 for the derivation of 
this formula). The smallest n such that P(n) < 0.5 is the number 
of matches where there is a higher probability than not of an 
injury being sustained by a single player. This metric represents 
the average risk over the whole team, and does not take into 
account differences between players. Club and international 
injuries were combined to avoid undercounting concussion inju-
ries. As such the metric will be referred to as the risk to the 
average player. The Python programming language (V
.2.7.12) 
with numpy (V
.1.11.2), scipy (V
.0.18.1), statsmodels (V
.0.6.1) 
and matplotlib (V
.1.5.3) libraries was used for incidence, severity 
and risk calculations.14
subsequent injury risk
The Andersen-Gill extension to the Cox proportional hazards 
model was used to quantify the risk of subsequent injury 
following return to play.15 16 HRs were calculated to compare 
players who had suffered concussions with those who had not 
suffered a concussion. Several preprocessing steps were taken to 
prepare the data. First, only active players on team rosters were 
selected to ensure each player had a complete set of injuries; if 
a player was not on a team roster for a Welsh club the injury 
was excluded. Club and international injuries were combined 
to avoid undercounting injuries to players who represented the 
national team.
Following this step, players were sorted into those who 
sustained at least one concussion and those who had not. The 
injury data for players who had suffered no concussions formed 
the non-concussive injury set used for reference comparisons. 
Players who had suffered a concussion had their injury data split 
into two sets: (1) injuries sustained prior to the first concus-
sion and (2) injuries sustained following the first concussion. 
For the non-concussive injury set a 'first' injury was randomly 
chosen from each player's injury data to allow a similar split to 
be determined. The longest possible interval between injuries 
was 4 
years because no time frame limit was imposed. Models 
were evaluated using the log-likelihood test. A p value greater 
than 0.05 indicated that the null hypothesis should be assumed 
and all HRs were consistent with unity. The R programming 
language (V
.3.3.1) and the survival library (V
.2.40–1) were used 
to perform the survival analysis.17 18
resulTs
Incidence, severity and risk
The data set contained 2441 injuries to 367 players, from a 
total player pool of 429 players. Therefore, 86% of players 
sustained an injury during the surveillance period. Match inju-
ries accounted for 1602 injuries, while there were 514 injuries 
during training. The remaining 325 injuries were sustained 
during other activities. The total match exposure was 11 
960 
player-match-hours, of which 1000 player-match-hours were 
from international matches.
The match injury incidence over the surveillance period 
was 94.5 injuries/1000 player-match-hours (95% 
CI 89.1 to 
100.2). There was a lower match injury incidence in club rugby 
(87.0 injuries/1000 player-match-hours; 95% 
CI 81.5 to 92.7) 
compared with international rugby (177.0 injuries/1000 play-
er-match-hours; 95% 
CI 151.9 to 205.1; RR 2.04; 95% 
CI 
1.73 to 2.39). The overall median severity for all injuries was 10 
days lost (95% 
CI 9 to 10). There was no difference between the 
median severity for club rugby (10 days lost; 95% 
CI 10 to 11) 
and international rugby (9 days lost; 95% 
CI 8 to 10).
Concussion was the most common injury (10% of club and 
international injuries combined) and the incidence was shown to 
increase over the four seasons of club, and club and international 
rugby combined (table 1; figure 1). The severity of concussion 
did not change over time in club, international, and club and

international rugby combined. The median severity of concus-
sion over the time period was the same for club, international, 
and club and international rugby combined (9 days; 95% 
CI 8 to 
9). The average player had a higher risk of sustaining a concus-
sion than not after 25 matches (95% 
CI 19 to 33) in club rugby, 
after 24 matches (95% CI 12 to 55) in international rugby and 
after 25 matches (95% 
CI 19 to 32) in club and international 
rugby combined, based on the incidence from the 2015–2016 
season. Considering the squad size and player-specific match 
exposure per season across the 4 
years, the proportion of the 
squad playing more than 25 matches per season was 10%.
subsequent injury risk
There was a greater subsequent injury risk following a concus-
sion compared to following a non-concussive injury (HR 1.38; 
95% 
CI 1.21 to 1.56), with players who sustained a concus-
sion having a 38% greater injury risk than players who did not 
sustain a concussion. Injury risk was assessed before and after 
players had sustained a concussion, with players having a 23% 
greater injury risk after concussion than before concussion (HR 
1.23; 95% 
CI 1.05 to 1.44). No difference in injury risk was 
found between players prior to sustaining a concussion and 
players prior to sustaining a non-concussive injury (HR 1.13; 
95% 
CI 0.97 to 1.31). The median time to next injury following 
a concussion was 36 days (95% 
CI 32 to 40), which was shorter 
than the time to next injury following an injury other than a 
concussion (49 days; 95% 
CI 44 to 53).
Risk of injuries to specific body regions was greater 
after concussion than prior to concussion (table 2). Injuries 
to the head and neck (HR 1.34; 95% 
CI 1.06 to 1.70), upper 
limb (shoulder and arm, HR 1.59; 95% 
CI 1.19 to 2.12), pelvic 
region (buttock and groin, HR 2.07; 95% 
CI 1.18 to 3.65) and 
the lower limb (leg, ankle and foot, HR 1.60; 95% 
CI 1.21 to 
2.10) were more likely in players following a concussion than 
to players who did not suffer a concussion. Injuries to joints and 
ligaments (HR 1.49; 95% 
CI 1.22 to 1.81) and to muscles and 
tendons (HR 1.38; 95% 
CI 1.12 to 1.70) were also more likely 
following a concussion (table 3).
dIsCussIOn
In Welsh Rugby Union, concussion injury incidence increased 
over the four seasons at a club level, but not international level; 
severity remained unchanged at both levels. Players were more 
likely than not to sustain a concussion after 25 matches and 
there was a 38% greater injury risk after concussion compared 
to following a non-concussive injury. Specifically, the subsequent 
injury risk was greater for the head and neck, upper limb, pelvic 
region and lower limb.
Change in incidence and severity of concussion
Our finding of an increasing secular trend in concussion inci-
dence in elite Welsh Rugby Union, when combined with findings 
from the RFU Injury Surveillance Project,2 suggests that concus-
sion incidence is rising throughout the professional game. At the 
international level, the concussion incidence was higher than in 
previous reports.6 19–21 However, the low level of exposure for 
the international team led to larger uncertainties. Combining 
longitudinal injury surveillance data from multiple international 
teams is recommended to see whether the recent increase in 
concussion persists at the international level.
World Rugby, rugby union’s international governing body, 
has implemented several concussion policies at the professional 
level. Others have speculated that the Head Injury Assessment 
protocol led to a rise in the reported incidence of concussion 
following its introduction as a pilot in 2012 and officially in 
2014.2 As a result, in the 2014/2015 season, concussions may 
have been reported that previously may not have been included. 
However, the continued rise in incidence in the 2015/2016 
season implies there are additional factors other than stakeholder 
awareness that contribute to the increased concussion incidence. 
Identifying concussion risk factors is an important next step. 
Researchers may need to take into account surface-specific 
match play demands (eg, tackles made and tackle technique) as 
grass has a greater concussion incidence than artificial surface.22

Furthermore, 50% of concussions occur in the tackle event7 
and recent reports show that an upright posture by the tackler 
increases the risk of the tackler needing a Head Injury Assess-
ment compared with a bent at the waist posture.23 Note that 
the latter technique is outlined as best practice in World Rugby’s 
coaching education.24 Therefore, assessing whether tackling 
behaviour has changed over recent years may provide further 
insight into changes in concussion incidence.
Concussion risk
The average rugby union player had a higher risk of sustaining a 
concussion than not after 25 matches; this rate was three times 
higher than the next most frequent injury in our data (thigh 
haematoma). Additionally, based on current season lengths 
(mean 34 matches) the data show that 1 in 10 players will 
surpass the 25-match threshold of concussion risk each season. 
However, with concussion incidence rising year on year and 17% 
of professional rugby union players reporting a concussion in the 
2015–2016 season,2 this appears to be a conservative estimate 
possibly due to being an ‘average’ player metric. Nevertheless, 
the data suggest that longer seasons would potentially expose 
more players to the risk of concussion due to a greater propor-
tion of the squad playing more than 25 matches each season, 
meaning decisions regarding season length should consider the 
injury risk implications.
subsequent injury risk
The subsequent injury risk to players following a concussion was 
38% higher than for players who did not sustain a concussion. 
Although the increased risk was significant, it was lower than 
the 60% reported for similar level players in the RFU Premier-
ship7 and lower than the 47% reported in professional associ-
ation football.8 When considering studies in rugby union, the 
reported risks are consistent with each other, within calculated 
errors, with the combined estimate of subsequent injury risk in 
rugby union from this study and Cross et al’s7 study being 1.49 
(95% CI 1.37 to 1.61). When the association football (soccer) 
data are included,8 the combined estimate of subsequent injury 
risk is 48% (HR 1.48; 95% 
CI 1.30 to 1.67). It appears that 
the increased injury risk (all injuries) following concussion is not 
specific to a single jurisdiction or sport.
The mechanisms underpinning this increased injury risk are 
not known. However, with the consistency between the two 
rugby union studies it could be speculated that the current 
length of the graded return to play protocol is insufficient 
because players can go from complete rest to full match play 
within 6 
days.25 Previous research has shown that increases in 
weekly workload that are greater than 10% were associated 
with an increased injury risk.26 Consequently, if a longer graded 
return to play protocol was implemented, workloads could be 
progressed gradually to safer levels, which may mitigate some of 
the subsequent injury risk by ensuring ‘spikes’27 in acute work-
loads are avoided.
There were several body regions, in addition to joint, liga-
ment, muscle and tendon injuries, that had a greater injury 
risk after concussion. A greater lower extremity injury risk was 
reported in collegiate athletes from multiple sports.9 10 Possible 
underlying mechanisms include altered balance strategies28 and 
impaired dynamic stability,29 30 in particular dynamic balance28 
and walking gait,29 30 which are negatively affected following 
concussion. This may also explain part of the increased injury 
risk to the joint, ligament, muscle and tendon structures, as 
loading across these structures may differ following concussion. 
We contend that small changes to balance and gait after concus-
sion may increase subsequent injury risk.7
This is the first study to identify the head and neck, and upper 
extremity body regions to also have an increased risk following 
concussion. It is conceivable that the nature of contact in rugby 
union exposes players to a heightened risk to these body areas, 
with the tackle event a common injury mechanism.2 6 Addition-
ally, if players are tackling higher up the body (eg, shoulder and 
above), a Head Injury Assessment is four times as likely than 
if tackling lower down the body.23 Therefore, the high initial 
risk of concussion and subsequent risk to upper body areas 
may be a by-product of tackle technique that does not follow 
recommended guidelines.24 However, contact is unavoidable in 
rugby union and it is unlikely that all concussions are due to 
improper tackle technique. As a result, further mechanistic work 
is required to understand whether the increased risk to these 
body areas is preventable within rugby union by considering 
whether factors such as oculomotor and vestibular dysfunc-
tion,31 and impaired dynamic stability and proprioception29 30 
affect tackle technique. The combination of epidemiological and 
experimental data supports the recent concussion consensus 
statement32 that graduated return to play protocols should look 
to include multifaceted strategies such as neuromuscular control, 
and oculomotor and vestibular protocols to both aid identifica-
tion and quantification of postconcussion symptoms, and miti-
gate subsequent injury risk.
limitations and strengths
The small number of teams involved in the study is a limitation. 
However, the injury data were checked every month of every 
season, minimising the number of incomplete injury records. 
Additionally, by tracking international players from clubs to the 
national team, we have provided the first subsequent injury anal-
ysis in professional sport that has included all time loss injuries 
sustained by a player, regardless of when it occurred. It should 
also be noted that the probability metric for injury incidence is 
the mean probability over the whole team. Variations among 
individual players are ignored, which limits the conclusions that 
can be drawn for individuals.
COnClusIOn
This is the first study to quantify the player risk of sustaining a 
concussion using a metric that estimates the number of matches a 
player can participate in before the risk of concussion passes the 
0.5 level. On average, rugby union players were more likely than 
not to sustain concussion after 25 matches. We have confirmed 
previous reports that there is an increased subsequent injury 
risk after concussion, and estimate the combined HR from this 
study and two others6 7 is 1.48 (95% CI 1.30 to 1.67). Following 
concussion, several body regions were at greater risk of injury,

Original article
specifically the head and neck, shoulder and arm, buttock and 
groin, and the lower limb (leg, ankle and foot). The types of 
injuries with greater risk were joint and ligament, and muscle 
and tendon. The mechanisms that underpin these concussion-as-
sociated risks warrant investigation.
What are the findings?
 
► Incidence of concussion has increased year on year during the 
study.
 
► Players are more likely than not to sustain a concussion after 
25 matches.
 
► On average, 10% of squad players were exposed to more 
than 25 matches per season.
 
► Across football codes (association football and rugby union) 
the subsequent injury risk after concussion is 48% higher 
than for players who have not sustained a concussion.
how might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
 
► Our study reinforces previous studies showing a greater risk 
of subsequent injury after concussion (compared with players 
who have not suffered concussion) and a secular increase 
in concussion incidence. This has now been demonstrated in 
several sports at different competitive levels.
 
► Monitoring and potentially limiting the number of matches 
players are involved in during a season to 25 matches is 
recommended.
 
► Multiple body areas and structures have greater injury 
risk following concussion. Multifaceted strategies during 
graduated return to play may aid identification of 
postconcussion symptoms or mitigate subsequent injury risk.
 
► Whether longer concussion rehabilitation periods would 
mitigate the increased rates of subsequent injuries remains to 
be tested.
