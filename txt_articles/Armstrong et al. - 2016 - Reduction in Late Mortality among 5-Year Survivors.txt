Abstract
Background—Previously, eighteen percent of childhood cancer patients who survived five years 
died within the subsequent 25 years. In recent decades, cancer treatment regimens have been 
modified with the goal of reducing risk for life-threatening late effects.
Methods—Late mortality was evaluated in 34,033 five-year survivors of childhood cancer 
(diagnosed <21 years of age from 1970-1999, median follow-up 21 years, range 5-38). 
Demographic and disease factors associated with mortality due to health-related causes, which 
exclude recurrence/progression of the original cancer but include deaths that reflect late effects of 
cancer therapy, were evaluated using cumulative incidence and piecewise exponential models 
estimating relative rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Results—1,618 (41%) of the 3,958 deaths were attributable to health-related causes, including 
746 subsequent neoplasm, 241 cardiac, and 137 pulmonary deaths. Reduction in 15-year mortality

 was observed for all-cause (12.4% to 6.0%, P for trend <0.001) and health-related mortality (3.5% 
to 2.1%, P for trend <0.001), attributable to reductions in subsequent neoplasm (P<0.001), cardiac 
(P<0.001) and pulmonary death (P<0.001). Changes in therapy by decade included reduced rates 
of: cranial radiotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (1970s 85%, 1980s 51%, 1990s 19%), 
abdominal radiotherapy for Wilms’ tumor (78%, 53%, 43%), chest radiotherapy for Hodgkin's 
lymphoma (87%, 79%, 61%), and anthracycline exposure. Reduction in treatment exposure was 
associated with reduced late mortality among lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms’ tumor 
survivors.
Conclusion—The strategy of lowering therapeutic exposure has successfully translated to an 
observed decline in late mortality among 5-year survivors of childhood cancer.

Pediatric; Cancer; Survivor; Mortality
In the 1960's less than half of children diagnosed with a malignancy achieved five-year 
survival.1 Now, over 83% of children diagnosed with cancer in the United States will 
become five-year survivors of their disease.2 As a result, in 2013 it was estimated that there 
were over 420,000 survivors of childhood cancer in the United States, and that by the year 
2020 this number would surpass 500,000.3 Increased success in treatment of childhood 
cancers has been achieved through the systematic conduct of clinical trials assessing the 
efficacy of multimodal approaches involving combination chemotherapy, radiotherapy, 
and/or surgery along with increased expertise in supportive care.4,5 Five-year overall 
survival has been the primary benchmark of therapeutic success. However, as five-year 
survival rates increased, it became clear that long-term survivors of childhood cancer were 
at increased risk for severe and life-threatening therapy-related late effects6-8 and excess late 
mortality (death ≥5 years from diagnosis).9-16 Previous work from the Childhood Cancer 
Survivor Study (CCSS) found that, by 30 years from diagnosis, 18% of five-year survivors 
had died.17
In more recent decades, risk-stratification of therapy has increasingly guided the design of 
treatment regimens for the majority of pediatric malignancies. Recent expansion of the 
CCSS cohort, which now includes survivors diagnosed across three decades (1970-1999), 
provides a unique opportunity to evaluate temporal changes in therapy and the impact of 
these changes on overall and cause-specific late mortality.
METHODS
Population
The CCSS is a multi-institutional, retrospective, hospital-based cohort study, with 
longitudinal follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed and treated at 31 
institutions in the US and Canada (https://ccss.stjude.org/). The 34,033 eligible subjects 
included those diagnosed with cancer before age 21, with initial treatment between January 
1, 1970 and December 31, 1999 and alive at five years after diagnosis of leukemia, CNS 
malignancy, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms’ tumor, 
neuroblastoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or a bone tumor representing approximately 20% of US

 children diagnosed with cancer during this time period. The cohort methodology and study 
design have been previously described in detail.18 The CCSS was approved by institutional 
review boards at the 31 participating centers. Participants provided informed consent.
Ascertainment of Cause of Death
Patients eligible for participation were included in a search for matching death records using 
the National Death Index through 2007. Underlying and multiple causes of death for 
deceased subjects using the International Classification of Disease – 9th and 10th Revision 
were provided by the National Death Index and identified the initiating cause of death using 
standardized rules useful for classification of deaths. For deaths that predated the National 
Death Index (i.e., those in 1975-1978, N=139), death certificates from states where deaths 
occurred were requested. Deaths were grouped into three mutually exclusive categories 
using ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding: 1) recurrence or progression of primary cancer; 2) external 
causes (accidents, suicides, poisonings, and other external causes; ICD 9: 800-999, ICD 10: 
V00-V99, Y00-Y89, X00-X99, W00-W99); and, 3) health-related causes including 
subsequent neoplasms (ICD 9: 140-239, ICD 10: C00- C97, D10-D36), cardiac (ICD 9: 
390-398, 402, 404, 410-429, ICD 10: I00- I02, I05-I09, I11, I13, I14, I20-I28, I30-I52), 
pulmonary (ICD 9: 460-519, ICD 10: J00-J99), and all other causes.
Cancer Treatment Information
Cancer diagnosis and treatment data including chemotherapy and radiotherapy exposures 
were abstracted from medical records at treating institutions utilizing standardized CCSS 
protocols, for 24,243 survivors who provided authorization.19,20 For the 9,790 survivors for 
whom treatment information was not available, multiple imputation was utilized (see 
Statistical Methods below).
Statistical Methods
Late mortality was evaluated beginning at five years from diagnosis to either death or 
December 31, 2007, the last date of the National Death Index search. Cumulative incidence 
of cause-specific death was estimated, stratified by treatment eras defined by 5-year (or 10-
year) intervals and by primary cancer diagnosis. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were 
calculated to quantify the rate of mortality in the CCSS cohort, relative to the age-, calendar 
year-, and sex-specific rates of the US population.21
Multivariable piecewise exponential models were used to assess relative rates (RR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) of death due to health-related causes in specific treatment eras, 
relative to a reference treatment era of 1970-1979, adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, 
attained age (single-year age segments of the piecewise exponential regression, modeled by 
natural cubic splines with knots at 10, 20, 30 and 40 years) and primary cancer diagnosis. If 
changes in treatment were responsible for changes in mortality, adjustment for treatment 
should attenuate the observed effects of treatment eras. Thus, within specific primary cancer 
groups, change in mortality was evaluated comparing the treatment era effects with and 
without adjusting for the treatment variables in the model, adjusting for sex, age at 
diagnosis, and attained age.

 To augment the regression-based analysis with a visual description of changes in treatment 
by era, “treatment scores” were calculated for individual survivors from the multivariable 
piecewise exponential model with treatment variables, adjusting for sex, age at diagnosis, 
and attained age but not including era: see Appendix 1 for the derivation and use of the 
“treatment score”.
For each survivor with missing treatment data, we applied multiple imputation22: see 
Appendix 2 for the details of the multiple imputation used and an associated sensitivity 
analysis. When the specific cause of death was unknown (n=440 Canadian cases), cause of 
death was imputed by the predictive mean matching method, using age at diagnosis, year of 
diagnosis, treatment institution, cancer diagnosis group, and treatment variables as 
predictors of causes of death (matching variables). For missing time of death (n=27), the 
multiple imputation method proposed by Taylor et al.23 was applied. Given that specific 
cause of death was not available for Canadian cases, a sensitivity analysis restricted to only 
US survivors was performed. Since no appreciable differences were found we present the 
original analysis results.
Because of the many comparisons made with these data, p-values for differences in 
mortality in specific cancer types or from specific causes should be regarded as exploratory.
RESULTS
The cohort of 34,033 eligible survivors, including over 9,000 survivors initially diagnosed in 
the 1970s, over 13,000 survivors from the 1980s and over 11,000 survivors from the 1990s 
(Table 1, Table S1), provided a total of 705,806 person-years of observation. Thirty percent 
of the population was between 30 and 39 years and 15% were older than 40 years of age at 
last follow-up (median 28.5 years, range 5.5-58.5 years). While overall 57% of the cohort 
received radiotherapy, 77% of survivors from the 1970s received radiotherapy compared to 
only 41% from the 1990s. In contrast, more survivors received chemotherapy including 
anthracyclines and alkylating agents in more recent eras, but the average cumulative dose of 
exposure was reduced in more recent eras (Table S2, Figures S1 and S2).
There were 3,958 deaths among the cohort, with 2,002 attributable to recurrence/progression 
of the primary cancer, 338 to external causes and 1,618 attributable to health-related causes 
including 746 to subsequent neoplasms, 241 cardiac deaths and 137 pulmonary deaths. At 
15 years from diagnosis, the cumulative incidence for all-cause mortality for survivors 
diagnosed in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s was 10.7%, 7.9% and 5.8%, respectively 
(P<0.001; Figure 1, Figure S1, Table S3). Across these decades the cumulative incidence of 
death due to recurrence or progression of primary cancer decreased from 7.1% to 4.9% and 
3.4% (P<0.001). Death from health-related causes, which includes deaths from late effects 
of cancer therapy, decreased from 3.1%, to 2.4 % and 1.9% (P<0.001) and reflected 
statistically significant reductions in mortality from subsequent malignant neoplasms, 
cardiac and pulmonary related diseases/events across three decades (Table 2, Table S4). In a 
multivariable model adjusting for cancer diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex and follow-up time, 
there was a reduced rate of death associated with more recent treatment eras. The adjusted 
relative rate per every 5 years was statistically significantly different than 1.0, not only for

 any health-related cause (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.82-0.89; Table S5), but also for cause-specific 
mortality related to subsequent malignant neoplasms (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.88), cardiac 
(RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.68-0.86) and pulmonary conditions (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.66-0.89). 
Similar patterns were seen in reductions in SMRs (Table S6).
Statistically significant reduction in mortality due to any health-related cause across 
treatment eras was observed in survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3.2% to 2.1%, 
P<0.001); Table 2), Hodgkin's lymphoma (5.3% to 2.6%, P=0.006), Wilms’ tumor (2.6% to 
0.4%, P=0.005) and astrocytoma (4.7% to 1.8%, P=0.02), but not in the other primary 
cancer groups. Cardiac mortality declined statistically significantly in acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia (0.36% to 0.05%, P=0.003), Hodgkin's lymphoma (0.88% to 0.46%, P=0.06), 
Wilms’ tumor (0.30% to 0.19%, P=0.04) and astrocytoma (0.89% to 0.15%, P=0.02), while 
mortality from subsequent neoplasms was statistically significantly reduced in survivors of 
Wilms’ tumor (1.9% to 0.49%, P<0.001).
Notably, temporal reductions in exposure of exposure for radiotherapy and anthracyclines 
were observed for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms’ tumor and 
astrocytoma (Table S2, Figures S2 and S3). For the diagnoses of acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, Wilms’ tumor and astrocytoma, temporal reductions in 15-
year health-related cause mortality followed temporal reductions in therapeutic exposure 
(Figure 2). The impact of treatment era on the rate of death from a health-related cause was 
assessed in multivariable models with and without adjustment for therapy (Table 3, Table 
S7). The effect of treatment era on the relative rate of health-related cause mortality was 
attenuated by the inclusion of therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (RR = 0.88 without 
treatment in the model compared to RR = 1.02 with treatment in the model) and Wilms’ 
tumor (RR 0.68 to 0.80), but not for Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR 0.79 in both models), or 
astrocytoma (RR 0.81 to 0.82).
DISCUSSION
Treatment approaches for pediatric cancers have evolved over the past five decades with the 
global objective of sustainable or increasing cure while minimizing risk for acute and long-
term toxicities.4,24 The current analysis confirms previously published data demonstrating 
that more recently treated patients have a significantly lower rate of late mortality 
attributable to deaths from recurrence or progression of their primary cancer.10,25-27 What 
has not been documented previously is the reduced rate of mortality due to death from 
treatment-related late effects such as subsequent malignancies and cardiopulmonary 
conditions. Additionally, the results generated from the CCSS cohort, provide evidence that 
the strategy of reduced treatment exposure to decrease the frequency of late effects is 
translating into a significant reduction in observed late mortality, extending the lifespan of 
children and adolescents successfully treated for cancer.
Appreciation of the risk for long-term adverse consequences of therapy6-8 resulted in the 
design and testing of newer treatment regimens to reduce the potential for late effects. This 
was generally achieved by reduction in therapeutic exposures for patients considered to be at 
low risk for recurrence of the primary malignancy, while providing therapy that would

 maintain or improve long-term disease-free survival.14,28-36 The availability of treatment 
exposure data in the CCSS cohort, including cumulative doses of most chemotherapeutic 
exposures and organ-specific radiotherapy dosimetry, provided a unique opportunity to 
evaluate whether the risk reduction observed in more recent treatment eras was directly 
associated with reduction in therapeutic exposure. We observed temporal reductions in 
health-related mortality concurrent with reduction in therapeutic exposure among acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia and Wilms’ tumor survivors. However, for Hodgkin's lymphoma 
and astrocytoma our findings suggest that factors other than reduced treatment exposures 
may have caused the observed reductions in late health-related mortality. Potential 
contributors to decreased late mortality include increased utilization and accuracy of 
screening modalities.37-39 While evidence suggests that guideline-based screening and care 
is not universal,40 it should be expected that these efforts would have a positive impact on 
health-related mortality. Finally, over the past several decades, there have been 
improvements in medical care that may delay or prevent death from late effects of therapy. 
However, our ability to directly measure these changes in the CCSS population is limited. It 
is also notable that for certain malignancies, primarily neuroblastoma, there is an increase in 
late mortality in more recent decades, presumably attributable to increased therapeutic 
intensity that resulted in improved five-year survival yet with an increased risk of late 
effects and delayed recurrence or progression of the primary cancer.
Importantly, the overall decrease in all-cause mortality is primarily attributable to reduction 
in death due to recurrence or progression of primary cancer, consistent with previous 
studies12,26 suggesting that survivors who achieve 5-year survival in more recent eras 
experience more durable remissions, or respond more favorably to therapy for relapse or 
recurrence of their primary cancers. Combined improvements in treatment of the primary 
cancer and reductions in health-related mortality result in an almost 50% decline in all-cause 
late mortality for survivors of childhood cancer (10.7% at 15 years post-diagnosis among 
survivors from the 1970s to 5.8% in the modern era).
While our previous report using registry-based data suggested that survivors in more recent 
eras may be at lower risk for death due to late effects of cancer therapy25, the large size of 
the CCSS cohort with detailed treatment information, provides compelling evidence for 
reduction in subsequent neoplasm, cardiac and pulmonary late mortality by decade. 
Interpretation of the current findings need to consider the following limitations: (1) the 
outcome of health-related causes of death does not allow direct attribution of death to 
sequelae from treatment of childhood cancer; (2) the inability to quantify and directly 
consider temporal changes in medical care; (3) a potential for bias resulting from shorter 
follow-up for survivors from the 1990s, though 10-year patterns appear consistent to 15-year 
mortality (Table S8); and, (4) the current analysis did not evaluate temporal trends in the 
incidence of specific treatment-related chronic health conditions that could increase the risk 
of death.
In conclusion, the impact of pediatric cancer treatment regimens designed to reduce the 
potential risk and severity of late effects is now being confirmed through the study of long-
term survivors. Along with increased promotion of approaches for early detection of late 
effects and improvements in medical care for late effects of therapy, quantitative evidence
