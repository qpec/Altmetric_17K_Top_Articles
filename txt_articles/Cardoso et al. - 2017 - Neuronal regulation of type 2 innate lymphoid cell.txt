Abstract
Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) regulate inflammation, tissue repair and metabolic 
homeostasis1. ILC2 activation is driven by host-derived cytokines and alarmins1. While discrete 
immune cell subsets integrate nervous system cues2–4, it remains unclear whether neuronal-
derived signals control ILC2s. Here we show that Neuromedin U (NMU) is a uniquely fast and 
potent regulator of type 2 innate immunity in the context of a novel neuron-ILC2 unit. We found 
that ILC2s selectively express Neuromedin U receptor 1 (Nmur1), while mucosal neurons express 
NMU. ILC2-autonomous activation with NMU resulted in immediate and strong production of 
innate inflammatory and tissue repair cytokines, in a NMUR1-dependent manner. NMU controlled 
ILC2s downstream of extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) and calcium (Ca2+)-influx-
dependent activation of Calcineurin and nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT). NMU 
treatment in vivo resulted in immediate protective type 2 responses. Accordingly, ILC2-
autonomous ablation of Nmur1 led to impaired type 2 responses and poor worm infection control. 
Strikingly, mucosal neurons were found adjacent to ILC2s, directly sensed worm products and 
alarmins to induce NMU and to control innate type 2 cytokines. Our work reveals that neuron-

 ILC2 cell units are poised to confer a first-line of immediate tissue protection via coordinated 
neuro-immune sensory responses.
ILC2s are abundant at mucosal barriers and act as key initiators of type 2 inflammation and 
tissue repair1. ILC2s are activated by cell-extrinsic cytokines, including interleukin 25 
(IL-25), IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)1. Previous reports indicated that 
discrete lymphocyte subsets and haematopoietic progenitors are controlled by dietary signals 
and neuroregulators2,4–11, suggesting that ILC2s may exert their function in the context of 
neuro-immune cell units (NICUs)4.
To interrogate whether ILC2s directly and selectively perceive neuronal-derived molecules, 
we employed genome-wide transcriptional profiling of ILC2s versus their adaptive (T helper 
cells) and innate (ILC1 and ILC3) counterparts12 (Fig.1a,b). This analysis identified the 
gene Nmur1 as being selectively enriched in ILC2s when compared to ILC1s, ILC3s and T 
helper cells (Fig.1a,b and Extended Data Fig.1a,b). This finding was confirmed by 
independent quantitative expression assays in multiple subsets of immune cells, including 
ILC1s, ILC3s, natural killer (NK) cells, eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, neutrophils, 
dendritic cells, T cell subsets and B cells (Fig.1c and Extended Data Fig.1c,d). Noteworthy, 
human ILC2 also expressed NMUR1 (Fig.1d). This gene encodes for a transmembrane 
receptor for NMU. The latter is a secreted neuropeptide found in the brain and highly 
expressed in the gastrointestinal tract13–16. As such, NMU acts as a neuronal-derived 
regulator in diverse physiologic processes16. NMU was shown to be produced by 
cholinergic enteric neurons, which also express the neurotrophic factor receptor RET13–
15,17. In agreement, neurons in the lamina propria were main expressers of the NMU gene 
(Nmu), while these transcripts were not detectable in enteric neuroglia and epithelial cells 
(Fig.1e). Similarly, all analysed immune cell subsets, including dendritic cells, macrophages 
and B cells, had no significant Nmu expression (Fig.1e and Extended Data Fig.1e). 
Strikingly, neuronal reporter mice (RetGFP and Chat-Cre.Rosa26RFP)18–20 revealed that 
CD3-KLRG1+ candidate ILC2s are adjacent to the intestinal neuronal network (4.716μm
±0.656), and lung ILC2 could also be found in the vicinity of local neurons (Fig.1f,g and 
Extended Data Fig.1f-h). Taken together these data suggest a paracrine neuron-ILC2 
crosstalk orchestrated by NMU-NMUR1 interactions.
To explore this hypothesis, intestine and lung-derived ILC2s were purified and activated 
with recombinant mouse peptide NMU (NmU23) (Fig.2a-e). Astonishingly, cell-
autonomous activation of ILC2s with NmU23 resulted in prompt and very potent expression 
of the pro-inflammatory and tissue-protective type 2 cytokines genes Il5, Il13, amphiregulin 
(Areg) and colony stimulating factor 2 (Csf2) (Fig.2a,b and Extended Data Fig.2a). NmU23-
dependent activation of ILC2s also increased ILC2 proliferation as measured by Ki67 
expression (Extended Data Fig.2b-d). NMU was shown to bind with similar affinity to two 
orphan class A G-protein-coupled receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR216. Formal definition that 
NMUR1 activation is the molecular link between NMU-dependent ILC2 activation and 
cytokine production was provided by genetic ablation of Nmur1. Activation of purified 
ILC2s with NmU23 led to potent expression of the type 2 cytokine proteins IL-5 and IL-13 
in a NMUR1-dependent manner (Fig.2c,d and Extended Data Fig.2e-h). Strikingly, and in

 contrast to the canonical ILC2-activating cytokines (IL-33 and IL-25), NmU23 led to an 
immediate strong expression of innate IL-5, IL-13 and AREG, indicating that NMU is a 
uniquely fast and potent regulator of ILC2-derived type 2 cytokines (Fig.2e and Extended 
Data Fig.3a,b). In agreement, in vivo administration of the neuropeptide NmU23 resulted in 
immediate and selective type 2 cytokine production from ILC2s, while their adaptive T 
helper cell-derived counterparts were unperturbed (Fig.2f,g and Extended Data Fig.3c). 
Noteworthy, while in the absence of IL-33 and IL-25 receptor signals NMU restored ILC2 
numbers in vivo, this neuropeptide failed to efficiently induce innate cytokines in the similar 
contexts (Extended Data Fig.4a-d). This suggests that NMU signals critically fine-tune 
immediate innate type 2 cytokines, while the canonical IL-25/IL-33 circuit regulates ILC2 
homeostasis and function with comparatively delayed kinetics (Extended Data Fig.4a-d). To 
formally establish the link between ILC2-autonomous NMUR1 activation and innate type 2 
cytokine production, we generated mixed bone-marrow (BM) chimeras with Nmur1 
sufficient and deficient BM progenitors. While NMUR1 signals were dispensable for ILC2 
homeostasis (Extended Data Fig 5a-f), an intact NMU-NMUR1 axis was critical for ILC2-
derived cytokines. Notably, NmU23 administration to BM chimeras revealed that Nmur1 
deficient ILC2 had reduced innate IL-5 and IL-13 expression when compared to their 
Nmur1 sufficient counterparts (Fig.2h,i). In contrast, T helper cell-derived cytokines were 
unperturbed in Nmur1 deficient cells (Extended Data Fig.5g,h). Together, these data indicate 
that NMU is a uniquely fast and potent cell-autonomous regulator of innate type 2 
inflammatory and tissue repair cytokines, via NMUR1 activation.
To further examine how NMU controls innate type 2 responses, we investigated the 
signalling cues provided by activated NMUR1 in ILC2s. In neurons, activation of NMU 
receptors leads to increased Ca2+ influx and ERK1/2 activation, while NFAT activity is 
required for type 2 cytokine production21–23. Stimulation of ILC2s with NMU led to 
immediate and efficient ERK1/2 activation, while inhibition of ERK activity upon NmU23-
induced ILC2 activation resulted in impaired type 2 cytokine gene expression (Fig.3a,b). 
Analysis of NMU-induced activation of ILC2s also led to immediate and robust Ca2+ influx, 
suggesting a role of the calcium-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase Calcineurin 
in NmU23-induced type 2 responses (Fig.3c). Accordingly, inhibition of Calcineurin upon 
NmU23 activation led to impaired innate Il5, Il13 and Csf2 expression, while NmU23 
activation led to rapid NFAT nuclear translocation in ILC2 (Fig.3d-f and Extended Data Fig.
6). Finally, inhibition of NFAT activity upon NmU23-induced NMUR1 activation led to a 
similar decreased in Il5, Il13 and Csf2 (Fig.3g). Thus, we conclude that the neuropeptide 
NMU can operate in an ILC2-intrinsic manner by activating NMUR1, which regulates 
innate type-2 cytokines downstream of a Ca2+/Calcineurin/NFAT cascade and ERK1/2 
phosphorylation.
To interrogate whether neuronal peptides can regulate mucosal defence we tested the impact 
of varying degrees of NMUR1 signals during infection with the helminth parasite 
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis24. Strikingly, infection of wild-type (WT) mice with N. 
brasiliensis resulted in strongly increased and sustained Nmu expression in infected tissues 
(Fig.4a), while expression of high levels of Nmur1 was still restricted to ILC2 (Extended 
Data Fig.7a,b). These observations suggest that NMU may regulate in vivo responses to 
worm infection. Accordingly, administration of the neuropeptide NmU23 in N. brasiliensis

 infected mice resulted in a robust and selective ILC2 response (Fig.4b and Extended Data 
Fig.7c,d), decreased tissue haemorrhage (Fig.4c and Extended Data Fig.7e,f), with 
subsequent increased eosinophil and mast cell infiltrates in the lung and reduced infection 
burden when compared to their vehicle (PBS) treated counterparts (Fig.4d,e). To further 
explore the role of NMUR1 in innate type 2 responses we infected Nmur1 deficient mice 
and their WT littermate controls with N. brasiliensis (Fig.4f-i). Strikingly, when compared to 
their WT littermate counterparts, Nmur1 deficient mice had decreased type 2 responses, 
notably reduced ILC2-derived cytokines (Fig.4f and Extended Data Fig.8a), increased tissue 
haemorrhage (Fig.4g and Extended Data Fig.8b-c) and impaired eosinophil and mastocyte 
infiltrates (Fig.4h). In line with these findings, Nmur1 deficient mice had increased N. 
brasiliensis infection burden at the peak of lung and gut infection phases, while late worm 
expulsion was intact (Fig.4i and Extended Data Fig.8d). To more specifically define the link 
between ILC2, the NMU-NMUR1 signalling axis and protection to infection, we performed 
chimeras of Nmur1 sufficient and deficient ILC2 into alymphoid host mice. Infection of 
such chimeras with N. brasiliensis revealed that Nmur1 knockout ILC2 had decreased type 2 
cytokine responses when compared to their WT counterparts (Fig.4j). In line with these 
findings, Nmur1 deficient ILC2-chimeras had increased N. brasiliensis infection burden 
(Fig.4k). Thus, we conclude that NMU regulates innate type 2 responses to provide 
immediate mucosal protection against early phases of worm infection. To interrogate 
whether enteric neurons support innate type 2 cytokine production, we have generated 
neurosphere-derived neuronal organoids (Fig.4l). Neuronal stimulation with the alarmin 
IL-33 or N. brasiliensis excretory/secretory products (NES) efficiently induced neuron-
derived Nmu (Fig.4m). In line with this findings, ILC2 stimulation with NES-activated 
neuronal supernatants increased innate type 2 cytokines and intranasal challenge with NES 
led to similar increase of ILC2-derived cytokines in the lung (Extended Data Fig.9a,b). 
Enteric neurons have been previously shown to express Toll-like receptors2,4. Strikingly, 
activation of neuronal organoids with NES or IL-33 induced Nmu expression in a myeloid 
differentiation primary response gene 88 (MYD88)-dependent manner (Fig.4m). To formally 
demonstrate the physiological importance of MYD88-dependent neuronal sensing on ILC2 
function, we deleted Myd88 in cholinergic neurons by breeding Chat-Cre to Myd88fl/fl mice. 
Strikingly, cholinergic-neuron-intrinsic deletion of Myd88 resulted in impaired cytokine-
producing ILC2 during N. brasiliensis infection (Fig.4n). Taken together, these data indicate 
that neurons can orchestrate innate type 2 cytokines through direct sensing of worm products 
and alarmins.
Deciphering the mechanisms by which ILC2s perceive, integrate and respond to 
environmental signals is critical to understand tissue and organ homeostasis. Our work 
establishes unexpected relationships between ILC2s and their environment. We deciphered a 
novel neuron-ILC2 cell unit orchestrated by NMU (Extended Data Fig.10). Mucosal neurons 
can directly sense alarmin and worm products to produce NMU. NMU activates ILC2s, via 
NMUR1, resulting in a uniquely potent and immediate production of innate type 2 cytokine 
downstream of ERK phosphorylation and activation of a Ca2+/Calcineurin/NFAT cascade 
(Extended Data Fig.10).
While it is well established that ILC2s integrate cytokine signals, including IL-25, IL-33 and 
TSLP1,11, here we demonstrate that ILC2s can integrate signals from different germ-layer-

 derived tissues to immediately trigger inflammatory and tissue repair type 2 responses. Thus, 
neuron-ILC2 cell units might be poised to confer a first-line of immediate tissue protection 
via coordinated neuro-immune sensory responses (Extended Data Fig.10). While afferent 
extrinsic nervous cues might also fine-tune local NICUs, future studies utilising emergent 
technology platforms2,4 are required to interrogate these putative interactions.
Previous studies demonstrated that ILC2s contribute to multiple homeostatic processes, 
including nutrient sensing, metabolism, tissue repair and infection control1,11,24–28. Here 
we reveal that NMU is the molecular link between neuronal sensing, innate type 2 responses 
and mucosal protection. Coupling neuronal activity and ILC2-dependent immune regulation 
may have ensured potent, efficient and integrated multi-tissue responses to environmental 
challenges throughout evolution. Notably, coordinated NMU-induced smooth muscle 
contraction16 and type 2 innate immunity may have coevolved to control worms that have 
been intimate evolution partners of mammals. In line with this hypothesis, NMU is highly 
conserved across mammalian, amphibian, avian and fish species16. Finally, our current data 
and other independent studies indicate that the mucosal nervous system partners with 
immune cells to ensure local tissue regulation2,3,29,30; thus, it is tempting to speculate the 
existence of neuro-immune sensory units that regulate physiology and homeostasis at an 
organismic level.
Methods
Mice
C57BL/6J (B6) mice were purchased from Charles River. Nod/Scid/Gamma (NSG) mice 
were bought from The Jackson Laboratory. Sperm from the strain C57BL/6-
Nmur1tm1.1(KOMP)Vlcg, which contains a Nmur1 deletion, was obtained from the KOMP 
Repository, University of California Davis and Children’s Hospital Oakland Research 
Institute, US. Nmur1-/- mice were generated by in vitro fertilisation at the Champalimaud 
Centre for the Unknown, Portugal. Chat-Cre20, Rosa26RFP 19, Rag2-/- Il2rg-/- 31,32, 
Myd88-/- 33 and RetGFP 18 and Myd88fl/fl 33 mice were on a C57BL/6J background. Mice 
were bred and maintained at the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown and iMM Lisboa 
animal facilities under specific pathogen free conditions. Il1rl1-/- Il17rb-/- mice 34,35 and 
their WT controls were on a BALB/c background and were bred and maintained at École 
Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland. Mice were systematically 
compared with co-housed littermate controls unless stated otherwise. 7-12 weeks old males 
and females were used in this study. All animal experiments were approved by national and 
institutional ethical committees, respectively Direção Geral de Veterinária and Service de la 
Consummation et des Affaires Vétérinaires Federal (Canton Vaud, Switzerland), 
Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown, iMM Lisboa and EPFL ethical committees. 
Randomisation and blinding were not used unless stated otherwise. Power analysis was 
performed to estimate the number of experimental mice.

 number GSE37448)12. Preprocessing of microarray data (including background correction 
and normalisation) was performed applying the robust multiarray (RMA) method36, 
included in the Bioconductor package affy37 for the statistical software environment R38. 
Linear models and the B (empirical Bayes) statistic were employed in differential gene 
expression analysis, using Bioconductor package limma39. Plots associated with the 
microarray data analyses were generated in R.
In vitro and in vivo ILC2 activation
For in vitro experiments, purified lung and small intestine lamina propria ILC2s were 
cultured in complete RPMI (supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% hepes, 
sodium pyruvate, glutamine, streptomycin and penicillin) at 37ºC. ILC2s were stimulated 
overnight for 2, 4, 6 and 20 hours with recombinant mouse Neuromedin U 23 peptide 
(NmU23) (100ng/mL unless stated otherwise; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals), recombinant 
mouse IL-25 and IL-33 (10ng/mL, unless stated otherwise) (R&D Systems). Control and 
activated ILC2s were cultured in the presence of IL-2 and IL-7 (10ng/mL; PeproTech), 
unless stated otherwise. ILC2s were lysed using RLT buffer (Qiagen). For cytokine protein 
analysis in vitro, ILC2s were incubated with brefeldin A (eBioscience) for 2, 4, 6 or 20 
hours prior to intracellular staining. For in vivo experiments, mice were injected 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) with NmU23 peptide (8μg/day) during Nippostrongylus brasiliensis 
infection or with a single dose of NmU23 (20μg) and analysed after 12 hours. Control mice 
were treated with PBS alone. For cytokine protein analysis ex vivo, ILC2s were incubated 
with PMA (50ng/mL), ionomycin (500ng/mL) (Sigma) and brefeldin A (eBioscience) for 4 
hours prior to intracellular staining.
Bone marrow transplantation
Bone marrow cells were flushed out from femurs and tibiae of Nmur1-/-, Il1rl1-/-.Il17rb-/- 
mice and their respective WT controls. Bone marrow cells were CD3-depleted using 
Dynabeads Biotin Binder (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. 106 cells of each genotype (CD45.2) were injected intravenously alone or in 
direct competition with a third-party WT competitor (CD45.1/CD45.2), in a 1:1 ratio, into 
non-lethally irradiated (150 Rad) NSG mice (CD45.1). Mice were analysed at 8 weeks after 
transplantation.
ILC2 adoptive transfer
For adoptive cell transfer, small intestine ILC2s from Nmur1-/- and Nmur1+/+ littermate 
control mice were purified and expanded in vitro in supplemented RPMI in the presence of 
recombinant mouse IL-2, IL-7 (10ng/mL; Peprotech) and IL-33 (10ng/mL; R&D Systems) 
for 1 week. 2×105 expanded ILC2s were injected intravenously into Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- 
recipients. Mice were infected with 400 Nippostrongylus brasiliensis larvae 1 week after 
ILC2 transplantation.
Parasite infection
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis was maintained by monthly passages in Lewis rats as 
previously described40. Infective (iL3) worms were kindly provided by Nicola Harris

 (EPFL, Switzerland). iL3 larvae were treated for 15 minutes with streptomycin and 
penicillin (300U/mL; Thermo Fisher Scientific), gentamicin (1.5mg/mL; Sigma) and 
tetracyclin (30μg/mL; Sigma), washed with PBS and counted under a stereomicroscope. 
Mice were injected subcutaneously with 400 iL3 in 200μL of sterile PBS using a 21G 
needle. Mice were sacrificed at day 1, 2 and 6 post-infection and lungs, bronchoalveolar 
lavage (BAL) and small intestine were collected and analysed.
Infection burden
Lung and small intestine parasite burden was quantified in minced lungs and small intestine 
as previously described40. Briefly, lungs and small intestine were placed on sterile 
cheesecloth and suspended in a 50mL tube containing PBS at 37°C for at least 4 hours. 
Viable worms that migrate out into the bottom of the tube were counted under a 
stereomicroscope (steREO Lumar V12; Zeiss).
Airway challenge
C57BL/6J mice were anesthetised by inhalation of isoflurane. Mice were challenged with a 
single intranasal (i.n.) dose of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis excretory/secretory products 
(NES) (5μg) (provided by Nicola Harris (EPFL)) or with PBS in a volume of 30μL for 4 
consecutive days. 24 hours after the last challenge lung and BAL were recovered for 
analysis.
Differentiation of naïve T helper cells
Enteric naïve T helper cells were purified and cultured in an anti-CD3 (2μg/mL; 17A2; 
Biolegend) pre-coated plate. For Th2 differentiation, cells were stimulated in the presence of 
soluble anti-CD28 (1μg/mL; 37.51), recombinant mouse IL-2 (10ng/mL) (Peprotech), IL-4 
(50ng/mL), anti-IFN-γ (1μg/mL; R4-6A2) and anti-IL-12 (1μg/mL; C17.8) (Biolegend). 
Polarised Th2 cells were analysed after 4 days of differentiation.
Cell isolation
Lungs were perfused with a solution of cold PBS with 2% heparin through the right 
ventricle of the heart and were subsequently finely minced and digested in complete RPMI 
supplemented with collagenase D (0.1mg/mL; Roche) and DNase I (20U/mL; Affymetrix) 
for 1h at 37°C under gentle agitation. For isolation of small intestine lamina propria cells, 
intestines were thoroughly rinsed with PBS, cut in 1cm pieces, and shaken for 30 minutes in 
PBS containing 2% FBS, 1% hepes and 5mM EDTA to remove intraepithelial and epithelial 
cells. Intestines were then digested with collagenase D (0.5mg/mL; Roche) and DNase I 
(20U/mL; Affymetrix) in complete RPMI for 30 minutes at 37°C, under gentle agitation. 
Enteric neurons and glial cells were isolated as previously described3,41. Briefly, isolated 
tissues were digested with Liberase TM (7.5μg/mL; Roche) and DNase I (20U/mL; 
Affymetrix) in complete RPMI for 30 minutes at 37°C, under gentle agitation. Digested 
organs were disrupted by passage through a 100μm cell strainer (BD Biosciences). A 
40-80% percoll gradient centrifugation was used for additional leukocyte purification from 
lung and small intestine cell suspensions. Erythrocytes from lung, small intestine and bone 
marrow preparations were lysed with RBC lysis buffer (eBioscience).

Enteric neurosphere-derived neurons
Enteric neurosphere-derived neurons were obtained as previously described29. Briefly, total 
intestines from Embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) to E18.5 Myd88−/− and control embryos were 
digested with collagenase D (0.5mg/mL; Roche) and DNase I (20U/mL; Affymetrix) in 
supplemented DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX (1% hepes, penicillin and streptomycin and 0.1% β-
mercaptoethanol) (Gibco) for 1 hour at 37 °C under gentle agitation. Cells were 
mechanically disrupted, washed and cultured in a non-adherent plate for 1 week in a CO2 
incubator at 37 °C in supplemented DMEM/F-12, GlutaMAX with B27 (Gibco), EGF and 
FGF2 (20ng/mL; R&D Systems). After neurosphere formation, cells were dissociated using

 NeuroCult™ (STEMCELL Technologies) chemical dissociation kit, according to the 
manufacturer's instructions. Dissociated neurospheres were plated on a 24-well plate 
previously coated with PDL (100μg/mL; Sigma) and cultured in supplemented 
NEUROBASAL media (1% hepes, glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin) (Gibco) with 
B27 for neuronal differentiation. After 7 days, neuronal organoids were used either for 
activation or immunostaining. Enteric neurosphere-derived neurons were activated with LPS 
(5μg/mL; Invivogen), recombinant mouse IL-33 (100ng/mL; R&D Systems) and NES 
(10μg/mL), for 24 hours followed by RNA extraction. For ILC2 activation experiments, 
conditioned media from NES activated enteric neurons was collected and applied overnight 
to purified ILC2s.
Purification of human ILC2s and T helper cells
For purification of human peripheral ILC2s and T helper cells, peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from human buffy coats by diluting the blood 1:2 
in PBS FBS 2%. The blood was layered on top of Lymphoprep™ (STEMCELL 
Technologies) and centrifuge at 800x g for 30 minutes at room temperature without brake. 
Human PBMCs were then washed and stained with antibodies against human lineage 
markers namely, CD3 (OKT3), αβTCR (IP26), γδTCR (B1.1), CD19 (HIB19), CD14 
(61D3), CD11c (3.9), CD16 (eBioCB16) (eBioscience); and CD45 (HI30), CD127 
(A019D5), CD161 (HP-3G10) (Biolegend), CRTH2 (BM16) (BD Biosciences) and CD4 
(OKT4; Biolegend). Human ILC2s were defined as CD45+Lin-CRTH2+CD127+CD161+ 
and human helper T cells as CD45+Lin+CD4+.
Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s 
protocol. When indicated, total brain, lung and proximal duodenum was collected for RNA 
extraction using Trizol (Invitrogen) and zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec) in a bead beater 
(MIDSCI), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentration was determined 
using Nanodrop Spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). Quantitative real-time RT–
PCR was performed as previously described5,8. Hprt, Gapdh and Eef1a1 were used as 
housekeeping genes. For neurospheres-derived neurons Hprt, Gapdh, Tubb3 and Rbfox3 
were used as housekeeping genes. For TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems) RNA was 
retro-transcribed using a High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystems), followed 
by a pre-amplification PCR using TaqMan PreAmp Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). 
TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used in real-time PCR. 
TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) were the following: Hprt 
Mm00446968_m1; Gapdh Mm99999915_g1; Eef1a1 Mm01973893_g1; Il5 
Mm00439646_m1; Il13 Mm00434204_m1; Areg Mm1354339_m1; Csf2

Mm00727586_s1 and Rbfox3 Mm01248771_m1. Real-time PCR analysis was performed 
using StepOne Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). For the analysis of human 
blood cells the TaqMan Gene Expression Assays were the following: HPRT1 
Hs02800695_m1; GAPDH Hs02786624_g1; and NMUR1 Hs00173804_m1. Samples were 
normalised using HPRT1 and GAPDH as housekeeping genes. The mRNA analysis was

 done using the comparative CT method (2−ΔCT). When comparison or fold change between 
samples was required, the comparative ΔCT method (2−ΔΔCT) was applied.
Cell signalling
Purified ILC2s from small intestine and lung were FBS starved for 2 hours before in vitro 
activation with NmU23 at 37°C. To test for ERK phosphorylation (Cell Signaling 
Technology), purified ILC2s were activated with NmU23 (100ng/mL; Phoenix 
Pharmaceuticals) in the presence of IL-2 and IL-7 (10ng/mL; PeproTech) for 10 minutes 
prior to intracellular staining. To test ERK, calcineurin and NFAT activation, ILC2s were 
cultured for 1 hour with their respective inhibitor and then stimulated with NmU23 
overnight before mRNA expression analysis. ERK inhibitor - PD98059 (40μM; Sigma); 
Calcineurin inhibitor - FK506 (100nM) and CsA (100nM) (Tocris Bioscience); NFAT 
inhibitor - 11R-VIVIT (10μM) (Tocris Bioscience).
Calcium signalling
Purified ILC2s from the small intestine were cultured with IL-2 and IL-7 (10ng/mL) and 
FBS deprived for 6 hours prior to calcium signaling experiments. ILC2s were stained with 
Fluo-4 Direct Calcium Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s 
protocol. Calcium (Ca2+) influx, represented by the Fluo-4 AM, was recorded over time on a 
BD Accuri C6 (BD Biosciences) flow cytometer as previously reported42. The recombinant 
mouse NmU23 was added 60 seconds after ILC2 baseline recording. Data was represented 
by the mean values of Ca2+ influx kinetics between the ILC2 baseline response and the peak 
of response after recombinant mouse NmU23 addition.
Histopathology analysis
Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The caudal lobe of the right lung was 
harvested, fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin and processed for paraffin embedding. 
Serial 4μm sections were stained for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Luna and 
immunohistochemistry for myeloperoxidase (MPO) was performed. Briefly, using standard 
protocols, antigen heat-retrieval was performed at low pH43 in Dako PT module, followed 
by incubation with the primary antibody (polyclonal rabbit anti-human Myeloperoxidase, 
Dako Corp). Incubation with ENVISION kit (Peroxidase/DAB detection system, Dako 
Corp) was followed by Harri’s hematoxylin counterstaining (Bio Otica). Negative control 
included the absence of primary antibodies. Slides were analysed by a pathologist blinded to 
experimental groups and images were acquired in a Leica DM2500 microscope, coupled 
with a Leica MC170 HD microscope camera. Quantification of inflammatory cell infiltration 
of the lung was performed in MPO-stained sections by manual counting of MPO-positive 
cells at 20x original magnification, corresponding to 0.2mm2 per field. Quantification of 
pulmonary eosinophils was performed in Luna-stained slides by manual counting the 
number of granulocytes with eosinophilic granular cytoplasm in low power fields (1mm2 per 
field).

Sections from lungs were obtained from NGS and irradiated (400 rad) Chat-Cre.Rosa26RFP 
mice after reconstitution with WT ILC2s. Sections of small intestine were obtained from 
Chat-Cre.Rosa26RFP and RetGFP mice. Sections of 100μm were obtained with a Leica 
VT1200/VT1200 S vibratome. Briefly, samples were fixed with 4% PFA at 4°C overnight 
and were then incorporated in 4% low-melting temperature agarose (Invitrogen). Samples 
were blocked and permeabilised with PBS containing 0.6% Triton X-100 and 2% BSA and 
incubated for 1–2 days at room temperature with the following antibodies: mouse 
monoclonal anti-KLRG1 (2F1/KLRG1; Biolegend); anti-CD3 (17A2; Biolegend) and anti-
Tubulin β 3 (TUBB3) (TUJ1; Covance) for small intestine imaging and anti-Thy1.2 (53-2.1; 
eBioscience), anti-CD45.1 (A20; Biolegend) and anti-TUBB3 (TUJ1; Covance) for lung 
imaging. Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-hamster, Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-rat and Alexa Fluor 
633 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen) were used as secondary antibodies overnight at room 
temperature. Distances between neurons and ILC2 were measured using Imaris software. 
For NFAT2 imaging ILC2s were sorted from small intestine of C57Bl/6J mice. ILC2s were 
FBS starved for 2 hours and treated for 90 minutes with NmU23 (100ng/mL). After 
stimulation, cells were plated in a pre-coated 0.01% of Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma) coverslip and 
let to adhere. Cells were fixed with 2% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Coverslips 
were blocked and permeabilised at room temperature for 30 minutes with a PBS solution 
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 1% BSA. Cells were stained at room temperature for 150 
minutes with mouse monoclonal anti-NFAT2 antibody (7A6; Abcam). ILC2s were incubated 
subsequently at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes with Alexa Fluor 488 goat 
anti–mouse antibody (Invitrogen) and then counterstained for 5 minutes with DAPI. For 
quantification of NFAT2 fluorescence intensity single-cell ILC2 nuclei were identified by 
DAPI staining. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined from each cell nucleus and NFAT 
signal was measured using ImageJ software. Enteric neurosphere-derived neurons were fixed 
in 2% PFA for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were blocked and permeabilised at 
room temperature for 30 minutes. Differentiated neurons were stained at room temperature 
for 150 minutes with anti-TUBB3 (TUJ1; Covance). Neuronal organoids were sequentially 
incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti–
mouse antibody (Invitrogen) and then counterstained for 5 minutes with DAPI. Samples 
were mounted in Mowiol and were acquired on a Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope using 
Plan Apochromat 20x/0.8 M27 objective and EC Plan-Neofluar 40x/1.30 and Plan-
Apochromat 63x/1.4 oil immersion objectives.

Extended Data Figure 10. A novel neuron-ILC2 unit orchestrated by Neuromedin U.
Mucosal neurons can directly sense worm products (NES) and the host alarmin (IL-33) to 
control Neuromedin U expression. Neuromedin U activates ILC2s in a cell-autonomous and 
NMUR1 dependent manner, resulting in a fast and potent production of inflammatory and 
tissue repair cytokines that confer immediate protection to worm infection. Neuromedin U 
activates NMUR1 inducing type 2 cytokine expression downstream of ERK phosphorylation 
and activation of a Ca2+/Calcineurin/NFAT cascade. This model indicates that neuron-ILC2 
cell units are poised to uniquely ensure potent and immediate type 2 responses in a 
Neuromedin U-dependent manner.
