Summary
Background Obesity has been linked to increased mortality in several cancer types; however, the relation between 
obesity and survival outcomes in metastatic melanoma is unknown. The aim of this study was to examine the 
association between body-mass index (BMI) and progression-free survival or overall survival in patients with 
metastatic melanoma who received targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy.
Methods This retrospective study analysed independent cohorts of patients with metastatic melanoma assigned to 
treatment with targeted therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy in randomised clinical trials and one retrospective 
study of patients treated with immunotherapy. Patients were classified according to BMI, following the WHO 
definitions, as underweight, normal, overweight, or obese. Patients without BMI and underweight patients were 
excluded. The primary outcomes were the associations between BMI and progression-free survival or overall survival, 
stratified by treatment type and sex. We did multivariable analyses in the independent cohorts, and combined adjusted 
hazard ratios in a mixed-effects meta-analysis to provide a precise estimate of the association between BMI and survival 
outcomes; heterogeneity was assessed with meta-regression analyses. Analyses were done on the predefined intention-
to-treat population in the randomised controlled trials and on all patients included in the retrospective study.
Findings The six cohorts consisted of a total of 2046 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with targeted therapy, 
immunotherapy, or chemotherapy between Aug 8, 2006, and Jan 15, 2016. 1918 patients were included in the analysis. 
Two cohorts containing patients from randomised controlled trials treated with targeted therapy (dabrafenib plus 
trametinib [n=599] and vemurafenib plus cobimetinib [n=240]), two cohorts containing patients treated with 
immunotherapy (one randomised controlled trial of ipilimumab plus dacarbazine [n=207] and a retrospective cohort 
treated with pembrolizumab, nivolumab, or atezolizumab [n=331]), and two cohorts containing patients treated with 
chemotherapy (two randomised controlled trials of dacarbazine [n=320 and n=221]) were classified according to BMI as 
normal (694 [36%] patients), overweight (711 [37%]), or obese (513 [27%]). In the pooled analysis, obesity, compared with 
normal BMI, was associated with improved survival in patients with metastatic melanoma (average adjusted hazard ratio 
[HR] 0·77 [95% CI 0·66–0·90] for progression-free survival and 0·74 [0·58–0·95] for overall survival). The survival benefit 
associated with obesity was restricted to patients treated with targeted therapy (HR 0·72 [0·57–0·91] for progression-free 
survival and 0·60 [0·45–0·79] for overall survival) and immunotherapy (HR 0·75 [0·56–1·00] and 0·64 [0·47–0·86]). 
No associations were observed with chemotherapy (HR 0·87 [0·65–1·17, pinteraction=0·61] for progression-free survival and 
1·03 [0·80–1·34, pinteraction=0·01] for overall survival). The association of BMI with overall survival for patients treated with 
targeted and immune therapies differed by sex, with inverse associations in men (HR 0·53 [0·40–0·70]), but no 
associations observed in women (HR 0·85 [0·61–1·18, pinteraction=0·03]).
Interpretation Our results suggest that in patients with metastatic melanoma, obesity is associated with improved 
progression-free survival and overall survival compared with those outcomes in patients with normal BMI, and that 
this association is mainly seen in male patients treated with targeted or immune therapy. These results have 
implications for the design of future clinical trials for patients with metastatic melanoma and the magnitude of the 
benefit found supports further investigation of the underlying mechanism of these associations.

Introduction
Metastatic melanoma is an aggressive disease with poor 
outcomes historically. However, the outcomes of 
patients with this disease have improved substantially 
after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
approval of targeted therapies directed at the MAPK 
pathway and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapies.1–4 
Despite these multiple new treatment options, overall 
survival in patients with metastatic melanoma remains 
heterogeneous. An improved understanding of factors 
associated 
with 
clinical 
benefit 
could 
improve 
personalised treatment and provide new insights into 
resistance mechanisms.
Obesity is an established risk factor for many 
malignancies, and is associated with worse outcomes in 
several cancers.5,6 However, higher body-mass index (BMI) 
has also been associated with improved outcomes in some 
cancers,7–9 a phenomenon dubbed the obesity paradox.10 
The role of obesity in melanoma has not been well studied 
to date.5 Existing data suggest that obesity is associated 
with an increased risk of melanoma in men11 and increased 
primary tumour Breslow staging scale thickness.12 
We recently reported that higher BMI was associated with 
worse survival in a large cohort of patients with surgically 
resected melanoma.13 However, the association of BMI 
with survival outcomes in patients with metastatic 
melanoma, particularly in those treated with contemporary 
targeted and immune therapies, is unknown. Notably, 
several associations have been described that could link 
obesity with worse survival outcomes in patients with 
melanoma, including germline genetic variants in obesity-
related 
genes 
associated 
with 
melanoma 
risk,14 
inflammation,14 obesity-related cytokines,15 and pro-
tumorigenic adipocyte cross-talk.16 Of particular interest, 
the IGF-1/PI3K/AKT pathway has been shown to have a 
key role in the pathogenesis of obesity in cancer,17 and has 
also been implicated in resistance to both targeted and 
immune therapies in melanoma.18,19
On the basis of these data, we postulated that obesity 
would be associated with worse outcomes in patients with 
metastatic melanoma. To test this hypothesis, we assessed 
the association of BMI with progression-free survival and 
overall survival in independent cohorts of patients with 
metastatic melanoma treated with targeted therapy, 
immunotherapy, or chemotherapy. Because of the well 
documented sex disparity in melanoma outcomes,20 as 
well as sex differences in body composition, we examined 
associations in male and female patients separately.
Methods
Study design and cohort populations
We collated data from six clinical cohorts of patients with 
metastatic melanoma treated with the three categories of 
FDA-approved therapies in this disease: targeted therapy, 
immunotherapy, or chemotherapy (two cohorts each). 
We included contemporaneous cohorts of patients with 
metastatic 
melanoma 
treated 
with 
dacarbazine 
chemotherapy, a control group in several trials with low 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed up to Aug 15, 2017, with the terms 
“melanoma” and “body mass index” and identified 149 articles. 
Of these, 14 analyses examined the association between 
body-mass index (BMI) and risk of melanoma, including 
12 primary studies and two meta-analyses. Overall, findings from 
the studies support that high BMI is associated with increased risk 
of melanoma in men, but not in women. Two studies found that 
increased BMI is associated with increased primary melanoma 
thickness, which is associated with an increased risk of recurrence. 
Only two studies have reported on the association between BMI 
and outcomes in melanoma. We recently reported that increased 
BMI was associated with worse survival in patients with surgically 
resected melanoma. A report of a clinical trial of dacarbazine with 
or without tamoxifen in patients with metastatic melanoma 
contained an exploratory analysis suggesting that increased BMI 
in men and postmenopausal women was associated with benefit 
from the addition of tamoxifen to dacarbazine. We did not 
identify any studies that examined the association of BMI with 
outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma or in patients 
with melanoma treated with targeted and immune therapies.
Added value of this study
Our study examined the association of BMI with outcomes in 
six independent cohorts, which together included more than 
1900 patients with metastatic melanoma. The cohorts 
included patients from several randomised clinical trials that 
led to US Food and Drug Administration approval of immune 
and targeted therapies, as well as their chemotherapy control 
groups, and one retrospective cohort of patients treated with 
immunotherapy. Our analysis showed that obesity was 
associated with improved survival in metastatic melanoma, 
an association that, to our knowledge, has not been identified 
previously. This association was independent of traditional 
prognostic factors. Furthermore, the survival benefit of 
obesity was restricted to patients treated with targeted and 
immune therapies and was not detected in chemotherapy 
cohorts. Finally, we identified that BMI was associated with 
marked improvements in survival in obese men compared 
with men with normal BMI, but found no such association in 
women.
Implications of all the available evidence
Our results have implications for the design of future clinical 
trials for patients with metastatic melanoma. The magnitude of 
the effects, as well as the novel interaction observed between 
BMI, sex, and treatment type suggest possible underlying 
mechanisms that should be examined further.

activity in this disease, to assess whether BMI was 
associated with outcome only in patients treated with 
highly active contemporary therapies or was generally 
prognostic in metastatic melanoma. All cohorts consisted 
of patients treated in randomised controlled trials, apart 
from a retrospective cohort including patients treated 
with immunotherapy.
The targeted therapy cohorts included a cohort of a 
cohort of previously untreated patients with BRAFV600-
mutant metastatic melanoma (with V600E as well as other 
activating V600 mutations) treated with the BRAF inhibitor 
dabrafenib plus the MEK inhibitor trametinib in the 
BRF113220 (part C), COMBI-d, and COMBI-v trials (n=617, 
599 patients analysed),4 and a cohort treated with the BRAF 
inhibitor vemurafenib plus the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib 
in the phase 3 coBRIM trial (n=247, 240 patients analysed).1 
The immunotherapy cohorts were a cohort of patients 
treated with ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) plus 
dacarbazine in the phase 3 CA184-024 trial (n=250, 
207 patients analysed)2 and a retrospective cohort of 
patients treated with the anti-programmed-cell-death 
protein 1 (anti-PD-1) or anti-PD ligand 1 (anti-PDL1) 
antibodies (n=342, 331 patients analysed) at four centres in 
the USA and Australia (pembrolizumab [n=250] or 
nivolumab [n=73; both anti-PD1] or atezolizumab [n=8; 
anti-PDL1]). The chemotherapy cohorts consisted of 
patients treated with dacarbazine in the control group of 
either the CA184-024 trial (n=252, 221 patients analysed)2 
or the phase 3 BRIM3 trial (n=338, 320 patients analysed).21 
The full list of eligibility criteria for the patients included in 
these cohorts is in the appendix (p 1). 
Procedures
BMI at treatment initiation was calculated as weight (kg) 
divided by the square of height (m) and categorised 
according to standard WHO definitions of underweight 
(BMI <18·5 kg/m²), normal weight (18·5–24·9 kg/m²), 
overweight (25–29·9 kg/m²), and obese (≥30 kg/m²). 
Underweight patients were excluded from analyses 
because of low prevalence (<2%) across the cohorts. 
Patients without height or weight data available for BMI 
calculation were excluded from all analyses.
Disease progression and response were assessed by 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
1.1 criteria. Outcome data were provided by the sponsors 
of each of the trials and based on intention-to-treat 
analyses, other than the retrospective cohort, for which 
outcomes were provided by medical oncologists of the 
collaborating institutions.
Outcomes
Primary outcomes were the association of BMI category 
with progression-free survival (defined as time from date 
of treatment initiation or baseline randomisation until 
disease progression or death) and overall survival 
(defined as time from date of treatment initiation or 
baseline randomisation until death) stratified by cohort 
and sex. Secondary outcomes were the association of 
BMI with overall response (complete or partial response), 
adverse events, and pharmacokinetics.
Statistical analysis
For each clinical cohort, we assessed the association of 
baseline BMI category with progression-free survival 
and overall survival outcomes. Survival curves for 
progression-free survival and overall survival across BMI 
category and by sex were generated with the Kaplan-Meier 
method. Confidence intervals for the Kaplan-Meier 
probability estimates were computed on the log scale by 
use of the Greenwood formula.
We assessed the association of BMI with prospective 
survival outcomes in Cox proportional hazards regression 
models adjusted for the following prognostic factors: age, 
AJCC 7 disease stage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) status, 
BRAFV600 mutation type, Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status, sum of target lesion 
diameters, number of disease sites, and previous adjuvant 
therapies received in the dabrafenib plus trametinib cohort; 
age, AJCC 7 disease stage, LDH status, BRAFV600 mutation, 
and ECOG performance status in the vemurafenib plus 
cobimetinib, and dacarbazine (BRIM3) cohorts; and age, 
AJCC 7 disease stage, LDH status, and ECOG performance 
status in the ipilimumab plus dacarbazine, pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, or atezolizumab, and dacarbazine (CA 184-024) 
cohorts. Additional prognostic factors considered included 
concomitant medications (dabrafenib and trametinib 
cohort) and serum albumin in the pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, or atezolizumab cohort. Because female sex 
was previously shown to be independently associated with 
improved survival,4 and because there were sex differences 
in BMI distribution in our cohorts, we assessed associations 
in men and women separately. Interaction for sex by BMI 
was tested using BMI as a categorical variable (obese vs 
normal BMI) using multivariable hazard ratios. We used 
logistic regression to assess associations of BMI with 
treatment response and pharmacokinetics. In all analyses, 
normal BMI was used as the reference category. Missing 
data were left out and not imputed.
In addition to the analysis of each individual cohort, we 
combined adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) using mixed-effects 
meta-analysis methods to assess the prognostic effect of 
BMI on patient survival in all patients, by treatment type, 
and by sex. We explored possible sources of heterogeneity 
by use of meta-regression analyses. We calculated separate 
average HRs for each treatment class, for each sex, and for 
each treatment class within each sex. Heterogeneity was 
evaluated using the Q and I² statistic: I² values of 25%, 
50%, and 75% correspond to low, moderate, and high 
degrees of heterogeneity. Statistical tests for interaction 
assessed the significance of categorical cross-product 
terms in multivariable-adjusted models.
Statistical analyses were done with SAS 9.4, JMP (SAS) 12, 
R 3.1.1, and S+ 8.0. All statistical tests were two-sided and 
considered significant at p<0·05.

Role of the funding source
The funder of the study had no role in study design, data 
collection, analysis, or interpretation, or writing of the 
report. The corresponding authors had full access to all 
the data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results 
The six cohorts consisted of a total of 2046 patients with 
metastatic melanoma treated with targeted therapy, 
immunotherapy, or chemotherapy between Aug 8, 2006, 
and Jan 15, 2016. 101 (5%) patients were excluded because 
of missing data on height or weight to calculate BMI. 
Of the 1945 patients with available BMI, 27 (1%) were 
underweight and were excluded because of low 
prevalence, leaving 1918 patients in this analysis. 
Of these, 694 (36%) were normal weight, 711 (37%) were 
overweight, and 513 (27%) were obese (table 1). More 
than half the patients (1155 [60%]) were male.
BMI distribution for the cohort treated with dabrafenib 
plus trametinib was similar to all the other cohorst 
analysed (table 1, appendix p 2). Clinical and tumour 
characteristics were similar across normal, overweight, 
and obese BMI groups (table 1; appendix p 2). A greater 
proportion of obese patients than those with normal or 
overweight BMI were prescribed metabolic syndrome-
associated 
medications 
(metformin, 
statins, 
beta-blockers, and aspirin; appendix p 2).
In the dabrafenib plus trametinib cohort, at a median 
follow-up 
of 
9·3 
months 
(IQR 
5·1–21·2) 
for 
progression-free survival, 386 events had occurred. An 
association was seen between obesity and improved 
progression-free survival in both univariable and 
multivariable-adjusted analyses (figure 1; table 2). 
Analysis of BMI as a continuous variable demonstrated a 
dose-dependent inverse relation between BMI and 
progression-free survival that extended through morbid 
obesity (appendix p 3).
With 
a 
median 
follow-up 
of 
20·9 
months 
(IQR 10·5–24·8) for overall survival, 282 patients in the 
dabrafenib plus trametinib cohort had died. In both 
univariable 
analysis 
and 
multivariable-adjusted 
analyses 
incorporating 
clinicopathological 
factors 
previously associated with outcomes with dabrafenib 
plus trametinib treatment,4 obese patients had 
improved overall survival compared with patients with 
normal BMI (figure 1; table 3). After adjustment for 
concomitant 
medication 
use, 
obesity 
remained 
associated with improved overall survival, whereas 
there was no longer an association with progression-free 
survival (appendix p 3). The proportion of patients with 
an overall response by BMI category is shown in the 
appendix (pp 4–5).
With 
a 
median 
follow-up 
of 
21·2 
months 
(IQR 10·5–32·7) in the cohort treated with vemurafenib 
and 
cobimetinib, 
there 
were 
132 
deaths 
and 
170 progression-free survival events. Progression-free 
survival and overall survival results were similar to those 
seen in the dabrafenib plus trametinib cohort (tables 2, 3; 
appendix p 6). However, after adjustment for clinical 
prognostic factors in this cohort, there was no longer an 
association of BMI with progression-free survival or 
overall survival (tables 2, 3). Cobimetinib pharmacokinetic 
data available for this cohort showed no significant 
differences in serum drug concentrations between BMI 
groups (appendix p 7).
In male patients in the dabrafenib plus trametinib 
cohort, 
obesity 
was 
associated

progression-free survival and overall survival compared 
with those for patients with normal BMI (figure 2; 
tables 2, 3; appendix p 8). Differences in progression-free 
survival and overall survival between BMI categories in 
men remained after adjustment for other prognostic 
features (tables 2, 3). 2-year progression-free survival and 
overall survival, and overall response, for men in this 
cohort are shown in the appendix (p 4). By contrast, 
progression-free survival, overall survival, and overall 
response did not differ significantly between BMI 
categories in female patients in the dabrafenib plus 
trametinib cohort (figure 2; tables 2, 3; appendix pp 4, 5, 
and 8). Differences in progression-free survival, overall 
survival, and overall response by sex were also seen in 
patients in the vemurafenib and cobimetinib cohort 
(tables 2, 3; appendix p 6).
BMI distributions of patients in both immunotherapy 
cohorts were similar to those in the targeted therapy 
cohorts (table 1; appendix p 9). With a median follow-up 
of 28·7 months (IQR 2·5–36·6) for progression-free 
survival in patients in the ipilimumab plus dacarbazine 
cohort, 176 events had occurred. With a median follow-up 
of 38·4 months (IQR 35·6–40·4) for overall survival, 
158 patients had died. Obesity was associated with 
improved progression-free survival and overall survival 
compared with those for patients with normal BMI 
(figure 1, tables 2, 3). These associations remained after 
adjustment for confounders in multivariable analysis 
(tables 2, 3). In men in the ipilimumab plus dacarbazine 
cohort, obesity was associated with improved overall 
survival and progression-free survival compared with 
that for patients with normal BMI (tables 2, 3; 
appendix p 4). By contrast, BMI was not associated with 
progression-free survival or overall survival in women in 
this cohort (tables 2, 3; figure 2).
In the 330 patients who were evaluable in the cohort 
treated 
with 
pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab, 
or 
atezolizumab, with a median follow-up of 25·4 months 
(IQR 18·4–34·2) for progression-free survival, 221 events 
had occurred. With a median follow-up of 24·1 
(IQR 17·4–33·9) months for overall survival, 162 patients 
had died. Obesity was not associated with progression-
free survival or overall survival in this cohort overall 
(figure 1; tables 2, 3; appendix p 8). Obesity was associated 
with improved outcomes in men in univariable analysis, 
but not multivariable analysis (figure 2; tables 2, 3; 
appendix p 8). By contrast, in women, no associations 
were seen between BMI and progression-free survival or 
overall survival (tables 2, 3; figure 2, appendix p 8). 
Overall, associations were consistent with those seen in 
patients in the ipilimumab plus dacarbazine cohort.
Serum albumin levels available for this cohort were 
similar across BMI categories (appendix p 9). In the 
331 patients in the BRIM3 dacarbazine cohort, with a 
median 
follow-up 
of 
(IQR 
3·0–21·0) 
months, 
257 progression-free survival events occurred and 
245 patients died. In the 221 patients in the CA 184-024 
dacarbazine cohort, with a median follow-up of 
28·5 months (IQR 0·4–36·2), 211 progression-free 
survival events occurred, and with a median follow-up of 
38·2 months (35·9–41·3), 196 patients died. BMI was not 
associated with progression-free survival or overall

survival in either cohort (tables 2, 3; figure 1). 
Furthermore, BMI was not associated with outcome in 
either men or women (tables 2, 3; figures 2, 3; 
appendix pp 8 and 10). 
We assessed frequencies of adverse events by BMI, sex, 
and grade in each cohort (appendix pp 11–12). There was 
no evidence that adverse events were more frequent in 
patients with normal BMI than in patients who were 
overweight and obese.
Pooling and analysing the results from all cohorts using 
meta-analysis, obesity, compared with normal BMI, was 
associated with improved outcomes (average adjusted 
HR 0·77 [95% CI 0·66–0·90] for progression-free survival 
and 0·74 [0·58–0·95] for overall survival; figure 3). We 
found heterogeneity in the prognostic effect of BMI by 
treatment type across the six cohorts for overall survival 
but not progression-free survival (figure 3). Associations 
between BMI and outcome were observed with targeted 
therapy and immunotherapy but not chemotherapy 
(figure 3). BMI associations with overall survival in 
combined targeted and immune therapy cohorts 
significantly differed from pooled associations observed 
for chemotherapy (pinteraction=0·002; figure 3). Although the 
association of obesity with progression-free survival for the 
combined targeted and immune therapy cohorts was 
consistent with that for overall survival, no significant 
interaction by treatment type was observed (pinteraction=0·34; 
figure 3). Consistent with findings from individual targeted 
therapy and immunotherapy cohorts, we observed 
differences in the association of BMI with outcome by sex 
in the combined cohort analysis (pinteraction=0·08 for 
progression-free survival and pinteraction=0·03 for overall 
survival; figure 3). Within the combined targeted and 
immune therapy cohorts, the survival benefit of obesity 
was restricted to men (figure 3). BMI was not associated 
with outcomes in the pooled chemotherapy cohorts overall 
or when stratified by sex (figure 3).
Discussion
Our analyses of multiple, large, independent cohorts of 
patients with metastatic melanoma treated with 
contemporary targeted and immune therapies showed 
that obesity was associated with improved outcomes 
compared with those in patients with a normal BMI. 
These associations seemed to be independent of 
traditional 
prognostic 
factors 
and 
concomitant 
medications, and were not explained by differences in 
treatment tolerance or pharmacokinetics. Our findings 
further suggest that the relation between BMI and 
outcomes in patients with metastatic melanoma might 
vary by sex and treatment, with a survival advantage seen 
in obese men treated with targeted and immune 
therapies, but not in women or in patients of either sex 
treated with chemotherapy, within either individual 
cohorts or in the pooled analysis.
Our findings in patients with metastatic melanoma 
contrast with previous data linking obesity with a slightly 
increased risk of developing melanoma,11,12 as well as a 
recent analysis of melanoma patients with clinically 
localised disease in which higher BMI was associated with 
worse survival.13 In aggregate, the findings support the 
presence of an obesity paradox across the spectrum of 
melanoma development, progression, and treatment 
response. This phenomenon, wherein higher BMI is 
associated with increased disease risk but confers a 
survival advantage in patients with established or 
advanced 
disease, 
has 
been 
described

malignancies.7–9 Whether this inverse relationship is

causal remains poorly understood.10 However, several 
features of our study suggest a potential biological role of 
adiposity in survival of patients with metastatic melanoma. 
In other malignancies in which the obesity paradox has 
been reported, the survival advantage is often limited to 
overweight or only mildly obese patients.8 Although BMI 
is widely used, it is an imperfect surrogate of adiposity 
and can misclassify body composition (fat vs muscle), 
particularly in the overweight range. By contrast, our data 
suggest a dose effect of BMI with modestly improved 
outcomes in overweight patients and a strong, consistent 
survival advantage seen in obese patients. We also 
observed a nearly linear association between increasing 
BMI and progression-free survival that extended to 
morbid obesity (where body composition is unlikely to be 
misclassified) in the dabrafenib plus trametinib cohort.
In several malignancies in which obesity has been 
associated with a survival advantage, either the cancer or 
its treatment (ie, chemotherapy) often cause weight loss, 
raising the possibility of reverse causality.10 Because BMI 
was analysed at a single timepoint (therapy initiation) for 
the cohorts assessed in our study, we cannot rule out 
potential antecedent weight loss, and future studies 
should include longitudinal BMI assessment. However, 
underweight BMI was rare (<2%) in these cohorts and 
such patients were excluded from our analyses. Moreover, 
the BMI distribution of each cohort mirrored that of the 
general population, with more than 60% of patients 
classified as overweight or obese.22 ECOG performance 
status and albumin concentrations (immunotherapy 
cohort) did not differ by BMI category, supporting the 
notion that patients in the normal BMI group were not 
cachectic at baseline. Perhaps most importantly, the 
obesity survival advantage was specifically observed in 
patients treated with targeted and immune therapy, 
regimens that are not usually associated with the 
substantial weight loss typical of chemotherapy-treated 
cohorts.
Our analyses also accounted for the potential 
contribution of traditional prognostic factors and the use 
of concomitant medications, which might have anticancer 
activity, including metformin, statins, beta-blockers, and 
aspirin. To interrogate other potential causes of the 
observed differences, we also examined frequencies of 
adverse events and available pharmacokinetic data 
(cobimetinib). These analyses again showed no differences 
by BMI category, supporting the notion that treatment 
tolerance and drug exposure are unlikely to explain the 
observed associations. Differences in drug absorption are 
also an unlikely cause given that associations were seen in 
cohorts of patients treated with agents given orally at a 
fixed dose (targeted therapies) and with agents with 
weight-based intravenous dosing (immunotherapies). 
The association of BMI with outcomes in patients treated 
with immunotherapy should be investigated again in 
future cohorts of patients treated with flat-dose regimens 
of these agents, which are now generally used.
The strength and consistency of these associations 
support the need for focused investigations into their 
biological basis. The interactions between BMI, sex, and 
therapy in the pooled analyses are provocative and

hypothesis-generating regarding potential mechanisms. 
Although targeted therapy and immunotherapy are 
fundamentally different treatment modalities, cross-talk 
between oncogenic signalling pathways and the 
antitumour immune response has been implicated 
in response and resistance to both treatments in 
melanoma.19,23,24 Although the impact of obesity-associated 
inflammation on carcinogenesis has been well studied, 
the effect of energy balance on the antitumour immune 
response has not been examined to date and should be 
investigated as a potential explanation underlying the 
observed interaction between BMI and both targeted and 
immune therapy. A study in renal cell carcinoma in 
which high BMI was associated with improved outcomes 
with targeted therapy found that alterations in fatty acid 
metabolism were associated with both obesity and 
outcomes.9 In view of emerging evidence implicating 
tumour and immune cell metabolism in melanoma 
therapeutic response,25 the relation between tumour 
metabolism and clinical metabolic phenotype should 
also be explored in this disease. Analyses examining the 
molecular, immunological, and metabolic correlates of 
obesity in melanoma are currently ongoing (or 
underway). However, the striking differences in BMI and 
outcome associations by sex reported here also suggest a 
potential hormonal mediator of the BMI effects.
In male patients, obesity was associated with a near 
doubling in survival whereas no associations were seen in 
female patients. Female sex has long been recognised as a 
predictor of improved outcomes in melanoma.20 
Intriguingly, our data suggest that obesity could confer a 
similar survival advantage in male patients with 
metastatic melanoma treated with targeted therapy and 
immunotherapy. Obesity in men results in higher 
concentrations of circulating oestradiol as adipose tissue 
aromatase activity converts androgens to oestrogen 
compounds.26 Interestingly, a previous randomised, 
controlled trial27 of dacarbazine with or without tamoxifen, 
a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, showed no 
benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma overall. 
However, high BMI in men and postmenopausal women 
were predictive of benefit from the addition of tamoxifen 
to chemotherapy, but not with chemotherapy alone, in 
this trial. Although menopausal status was not available 
for the cohorts in our analysis, this interaction should be 
investigated in future studies and would further 
strengthen the hypothesis of a hormonal mediator driving 
the observed associations. Melanoma lacks substantial 
oestrogen receptor α expression, the receptor responsible 
for the proliferative effects of oestrogen on breast cancer. 
However, previous reports have suggested high oestrogen 
receptor β expression in primary melanoma, which might 
have 
antiproliferative 
activity.28,29 
More 
recently, 
non-classical oestrogen receptor signalling through a 
G protein-coupled oestrogen receptor (GPER) has been 
found to regulate melanoma differentiation  status, which 
has been implicated in resistance to both targeted and

immune therapy in this disease. Importantly, a GPER 
agonist has further been shown to synergize with anti-
PD1 immunotherapy by increasing immunogenicity.30 
Moreover, the effect of oestrogen on immune function 
has been well studied in the context of sex disparities in 
the frequency of autoimmune disease, and immune 
response to vaccines and pathogens, and is another 
potential mechanism by which hormones could mediate 
the observed BMI effect.
The pooled analysis has several limitations and should 
be viewed as exploratory given that there were only 
six cohorts, because meta-analysis methods are 
problematic with small numbers of studies. As further 
data on the associations between BMI and outcomes in 
melanoma become available, full meta-analyses should 
be done. Within the pooled analysis, we observed 
significant interactions between BMI, therapy, and sex, 
which support the associations seen within the 
individual cohorts. However, even with the pooled 
analysis, a smaller number of women (particularly 
obese women) included in the cohorts could have 
limited the statistical power to detect associations in 
this 
group. 
Moreover, 
our 
analysis 
could 
be 
underpowered to detect the association between BMI 
and outcomes in a treatment that has a low frequency of 
response (ie, chemotherapy). However, the striking 
survival advantage seen in obese men in the ipilimumab 
plus dacarbazine cohort would argue against this 
possibility because the proportion of patients with 
response to ipilimumab (10–15%) is only marginally 
higher than that observed with chemotherapy.
In conclusion, obesity is associated with improved 
outcomes in male patients with metastatic melanoma 
treated with targeted and immune therapies. The use of 
pooled data from the dabrafenib plus trametinib 
treatment groups from multiple clinical trials, which 
had previously been analysed for clinical prognostic 
factors, allowed for robust covariate adjustment and 
examination of RECIST response in addition to 
survival.4 As survival data matures from the anti-PD-1 
immunotherapy trials, we will validate the findings of 
the multi-institutional retrospective anti-PD-1 cohort 
presented here with clinical trial level data. The 
association of BMI and outcomes in other malignancies 
in which targeted or immune therapies are approved 
should also be examined. The observed differences in 
overall survival in male patients were similar to or larger 
than differences seen in several previous registration 
trials in metastatic melanoma.1,31 These findings support 
the need to consider sex and BMI as stratification factors 
in trials, and to investigate the biological mechanisms 
underlying these unexpected results.
