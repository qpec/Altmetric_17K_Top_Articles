Catheter ablation is increasingly offered to patients who suffer from symptoms due to atrial fibrillation (AF), based on a growing body of evi-
dence illustrating its efficacy compared with antiarrhythmic drug therapy. Approximately one-third of AF ablation procedures are currently
performed in patients with persistent or long-standing persistent AF. Here, we review the available information to guide catheter ablation
in these more chronic forms of AF. We identify the following principles: Our clinical ability to discriminate paroxysmal and persistent AF is
limited. Pulmonary vein isolation is a reasonable and effective first approach for catheter ablation of persistent AF. Other ablation strategies
are being developed and need to be properly evaluated in controlled, multicentre trials. Treatment of concomitant conditions promoting re-
current AF by life style interventions and medical therapy should be a routine adjunct to catheter ablation of persistent AF. Early rhythm control
therapy has a biological rationale and trials evaluating its value are underway. There is a clear need to generate more evidence for the best
approach to ablation of persistent AF beyond pulmonary vein isolation in the form of adequately powered controlled multi-centre trials.

Introduction
Recent prevalence estimates suggest that at least 33.5 million per-
sons are affected by atrial fibrillation (AF).1 Catheter ablation is
increasingly offered to relieve AF-related symptoms,2– 4 based on
evidence illustrating its efficacy compared with antiarrhythmic
drug therapy.5 – 9 There is less evidence supporting AF ablation in
persistent AF, although small studies suggest better maintenance
of sinus rhythm. Two years ago, the first multicentre trial comparing
catheter ablation with cardioversion and antiarrhythmic drugs as
first-line therapy for persistent AF has been reported and demon-
strated more effective maintenance of sinus rhythm, as well as bet-
ter quality of life, in patients randomized to catheter ablation.10 In
recently published surveys, approximately one-third of AF ablation
procedures were performed in patients with persistent or long-
standing persistent AF.4 Here, we discuss recent data suggesting
that our clinical ability to discriminate paroxysmal and persistent
AF is limited, review the evidence supporting the use of catheter
ablation in persistent AF, illustrate approaches to improve
sinus rhythm maintenance by comprehensive cardiovascular risk re-
duction,11 discuss the value of different ablation strategies, and high-
light the need for adequate validation of novel approaches to
catheter ablation for persistent AF.
What is persistent atrial fibrillation
Persistent AF is defined as AF that persists without interruption for
7 days or longer.5,6 Whether patients who have been cardioverted
during the first 7 days of an AF episode should be classified as per-
sistent or paroxysmal has been defined differently in the USA and in
Europe,5,6 but this only pertains to a small number of patients who
receive early cardioversion. Patients who are in AF for .1 year are
classed as long-standing persistent AF.5,6 Most patients who initially
present with paroxysmal, self-terminating AF will progress to chron-
ic forms of the arrhythmia (including permanent AF) or switch back
and forth between paroxysmal and persistent or long-standing per-
sistent AF.12,13 This simple observation already suggests that

 paroxysmal and persistent AF are not biologically distinct entities,
but rather constitute different presentations of the same arrhyth-
mia, loosely associated with different stages of the disease. Consist-
ent with this general concept, patients diagnosed with persistent AF
are generally older than those in paroxysmal AF, and present with
more comorbidities.14,15 Over the last decade, the ECG-monitoring
technology available to health care professionals and to the general
public has tremendously advanced, thus profoundly improving our
ability to differentiate AF patterns, reflected in consensus state-
ments that informed regulatory bodies.7,16 Importantly, a recent
analysis of continued atrial rhythm monitoring using implanted de-
vices suggests that the AF pattern (or ‘AF burden’) does not differ
too much between patients who have been clinically diagnosed
with ‘paroxysmal’ or ‘persistent’ AF.17 Hence, the mere clinical clas-
sification of the AF pattern as ‘persistent’ may neither be sufficient
justification to decide on a specific ablation strategy nor too power-
ful to predict the effectiveness of catheter ablation. It rather seems
reasonable to assume that some patients with persistent AF
respond to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) as well as patients in par-
oxysmal AF, while others (with either AF pattern) are likely to de-
velop recurrent AF.
Prevention of recurrent atrial
fibrillation in patients scheduled
for ablation of persistent atrial
fibrillation
It is well established that many patients already present with sub-
stantial atrial damage at the first episode of AF, and concomitant
conditions such as hypertension, obesity, heart failure, chronic kid-
ney disease, and others will cause ‘remodelling’ of the atria prior to
occurrence of AF.11,18 On top of this ‘remodelling’, AF induces elec-
trical and structural changes in the atria that occur within days to
weeks (Figure 1). Nonetheless, some patients develop AF without
detectable concomitant conditions late in life.19
Figure 1 Major health modifiers promoting recurrent atrial fibrillation (orange boxes) and the likely intermediary mechanisms causing atrial
damage and leading to atrial fibrillation (open boxes, top part, health modifiers taken from Fabritz et al.89). The green boxes at the bottom illustrate
interventions that can mitigate or reverse these effects. These ancillary interventions should be an integral part of the management of patients
undergoing catheter ablation of persistent atrial fibrillation.
21
Catheter ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation
 A number of factors promote recurrent AF in patients, including
those that undergo ablation of AF. Interestingly, time since the first
diagnosis of AF is only a weak factor, while the time spent in continu-
ous AF prior to ablation is a better predictor of outcome, where
maintenance of sinus rhythm after ablation is less likely in patients
spending .3 years continuously in AF prior to ablation (‘long-
standing persistent’ AF).20
Other drivers of recurrent AF are related to clinical conditions
that promote structural remodelling. Left atrial remodelling, which
can be assessed invasively by quantifying areas of low-voltage left at-
rial signals, or with MR imaging,21–24 is largely determined by con-
comitant cardiovascular conditions and possibly by duration of AF,
while other factors were derived from clinical information.25,26 It is
worthwhile to consider that the effect of any AF ablation procedure
is to induce further areas of delayed gadolinium enhancement.23,27
While the natural ageing process is presently difficult to modu-
late, several factors associated with recurrent AF after catheter ab-
lation can be modified by medical therapy or life style interventions
(Table 1). Initial results of such life style interventions, e.g. regular ex-
ercise28 or systematic weight reduction in obese patients scheduled
for AF ablation,29,30 are promising. Initial results also suggest that
antihypertensive therapies that modulate central sympathetic tone
(moxonidine) reduce recurrent AF after catheter ablation.31 Angio-
tensin converting enzyme inhibitors or sartans, while not effective in
preventing recurrent AF in patients without structural heart disease
in the short term,32,33 may have long-term beneficial effects for the
primary prevention of AF.34 It has also been suggested that
evidence-based therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection frac-
tion can help to prevent AF.35 Likewise, adequate revascularization
and treatment of mitral valve disease are likely to help stabilize sinus
rhythm and restore atrial function (Figure 1). While it will be difficult
to evaluate each of these interventions separately in outcome trials,
it seems reasonable to integrate adequate treatment of modifiable
cardiovascular conditions into the management of patients under-
going ablation of AF based on their known general cardiovascular
benefits.36 In addition, it is common practice to use antiarrhythmic
drugs for 3 months after catheter ablation of AF, including for per-
sistent AF. Such treatment probably suppresses short-term recur-
rences of AF, but does not alter the mid-term recurrence rate.37
This practice seems reasonable.
Pulmonary vein isolation prevents
recurrent atrial fibrillation in
some, but not all patients with
persistent atrial fibrillation
The first description that triggers in the pulmonary veins initiate AF
and that their elimination by radio frequency ablation prevents AF
has been a key disruptive discovery shaping AF ablation.38 Pulmon-
ary vein isolation remains the cornerstone of AF ablation until to-
day.7 Two-thirds of surveyed European centres perform PVI
without additional ablation targets as a first-line therapy for persist-
ent AF.39 Pulmonary vein isolation conveys a 60–80% rate of main-
taining sinus rhythm after 1 year in patients who predominantly
present with paroxysmal forms of AF, not different between centres
mainly using cryoballoon and irrigated radio frequency ablation.40–42
The rhythm outcome in patients with persistent AF is more variable,
but not much worse in some series (Table 2). The maintenance of
sinus rhythm is not dramatically different between ‘persistent’ AF
patients undergoing PVI alone compared with patients undergoing
more extensive ablation approaches, including a risk to develop
left atrial tachycardia with either approach (Table 2).40
One of the most important recent studies in field of ablation of
persistent AF was the Star AF 2 trial.43 This landmark study rando-
mized 589 patients with persistent AF to PV isolation alone (N ¼ 67
patients), to PVI plus linear ablation (N ¼ 259 patients), or to PVI
and ablation of continuous fractionated electrograms ablation
(CFAE, N ¼ 263 patients). The results of this study revealed no
difference in outcomes of these three ablation strategies. After
18 months of follow-up, 59% of patients assigned to PVI alone
were AF free, when compared with 49% of patients assigned to
PVI plus CFAE ablation and 46% of patients assigned to PVI plus lin-
ear ablation. The lack of additional effects of CFAE ablation possibly
came as less of a surprise as the lack of effects of linear lesions.44,45
The longer procedure duration of extended ablation procedures,
associated with higher radiation exposure and possibly higher com-
plication rates, should be considered in this context. Star AF 2 clear-
ly supports the use of PVI without further ablation as the first-line
therapy in patients with persistent AF, opening the possibility of
catheter ablation of persistent AF using cryothermy balloons in
the future.46 We propose that a group of patients with persistent
AF respond as well to PVI as patients with paroxysmal AF.
Targets for catheter ablation

the ‘cornerstone’ of AF ablation.7 The document also stated that

 additional ablation strategies should be considered when ablating
persistent AF, and expressed a need for sufficiently powered multi-
centre trials comparing different AF ablation strategies. At that time
there was no consensus as to which of these ablation strategies was
optimal.
Prior to the seminal description of triggers in the pulmonary veins
initiating AF,38 several skilled groups developed different sets of lin-
ear left and right atrial lesions in an attempt to prevent AF.57 –61 Sev-
eral linear lesions, e.g. around the mitral isthmus or a ‘roof line’
connecting the ablation lesions encircling the pulmonary veins,
have been re-used as relevant adjuncts to PVI in persistent AF
(Figure 2).54,56,62,63 Additional lesions that have been proposed are
a ‘box’ encircling the posterior left atrium including all four pulmon-
ary veins, and a line isolating the left atrial appendage (Figure 2). Initial
reports, often comprising procedures done in a single centre and
relying on a few dozen of patients, were promising, while larger,
confirmatory studies often yielded higher recurrence rates. One
commonly proposed ablation strategy at the time was the ‘stepwise’
approach to ablation of persistent AF proposed and championed by
the Bordeaux group.64,65 Like other developments in the field that
were mainly developed and evaluated in a small number of centres,
this approach has never gained wide-spread use. A recent publica-
tion describing the long-term outcomes of 150 patients who under-
went the stepwise approach to ablation of persistent AF using the
stepwise approach was somewhat sobering. Arrhythmia-free sur-
vival rates after a single procedure were 35.3 + 3.9, 28.0 + 3.7,
and 16.8+3.2% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively.54
New ablation strategies for ablation of persistent AF have started
to emerge. One of these new strategies involves the use of a multi-
electrode basket catheter to map ‘rotors’, i.e. areas that are critical
for maintenance of AF.66,67 Some, but not all, of the published out-
comes using this basket-based rotor mapping-based approach have
reported encouraging results.67,68 Non-invasive body surface po-
tential mapping has been used by another group to identify such crit-
ical areas (described as ‘drivers’ or ‘focal sources’ by these
researchers).69,70 Another strategy that has been developed is to
homogenize areas of scar, using MRI or voltage mapping to identify
areas of scar (see Figure 3 for illustrative examples of abnormal areas
of low voltage in the left atrium). Once identified these areas of
scar are ablated in an attempt to eliminate any potential re-entrant
circuits.71 Experimental data suggest that the core of a rotor may
often co-localize with areas of conduction block, in line with the
behaviour of voltage vectors constructed from filtered electro-
grams. Hence, these two approaches may result in somewhat
overlapping ablation lesions. The concept of targeting fractio-
nated electrograms (CFAE) has been abandoned by many centres
after disappointing results of controlled trials. These lesions are
placed based on electrogram characteristics and do not follow a
defined anatomical pattern.
Whether any of the novel strategies listed above proves to be su-
perior to PVI alone for ablation of persistent AF remains to be de-
termined. Currently, a large variety of ablation strategies are being
employed with a goal of obtaining preliminary data concerning
whether these new ablation strategies are more effective than PV
isolation alone. When interpreting results from studies evaluating
novel ablation strategies, it seems important to recognise a major
limitation of current catheter ablation interventions: Even when
the PVI is performed in selected, highly experienced centres with

Catheter ablation in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation
 a clear aim to achieve complete isolation, this is only achieved in a
minority of patients.72 Hence, better technology is needed to
achieve transmural lesions. This has implications not only for the
evaluation of linear lesions but also for other ablation concepts.
At some point these new ablation strategies will need to be com-
pared head to head with PV isolation alone in sufficiently powered
multicentre trials similar to the design of the Star-AF 2 Trial de-
scribed above. Until that point, these new approaches must be con-
sidered experimental and their value unproven.
Early rhythm control therapy
More and more electrophysiologists are opting to perform AF abla-
tion early in the course of the AF journey in an attempt to reduce AF
burden and limit AF-induced atrial damage. Consistent with this
trend are the recommendations by both the ESC AF Guidelines
and also the AHA/ACC/HRS AF consensus document that catheter
ablation of paroxysmal AF may be considered as first-line ther-
apy11,73 based on patient preference and when performed in experi-
enced centres.74 While published trials, relying on antiarrhythmic
drug therapy and often accepting interruption of oral anticoagula-
tion after sinus rhythm restoration, have not shown a prognostic
benefit of rhythm control therapy over usual care,75 there is bio-
logical reason to believe that sinus rhythm maintenance could
help to prevent these cardiovascular events.76–79 Intermittent per-
iods of sinus rhythm may reverse some of the underlying adaptive
processes (‘electrical’ and ‘structural’ remodelling).78,80 Activation
patterns in the fibrillating atria are heterogeneous and highly variable
over time.81 The complexity of electrical activity in AF, described as
drivers,56 epicardial break through,82 – 84 rotor,85 or AF cycle
length,86 increases with longer duration of continuous AF. A novelty
of the rhythm control approach in In EAST—AFNET 4 is the man-
date for an early rhythm control therapy intervention,87,88 informed
by the observation that AF-induced atrial remodelling may facilitate
recurrent AF during later stages of the disease. It remains to be seen
if this early intervention approach bear can also help to prevent
strokes and other major cardiovascular outcomes in AF patients.
Summary
Catheter ablation is a reasonably effective intervention to achieve res-
toration and maintenance of sinus rhythm in patients with persistent
AF. The evidence underpinning the use of catheter ablation is less
strong for persistent and long-standing persistent AF than for parox-
ysmal AF. Acknowledging the need for further data, we suggest the fol-
lowing principles to guide catheter ablation of persistent AF (Figure 4):
(1) Many patients who are clinically classified as ‘persistent AF’ will
have a similar AF patterns to other patients who are classified as
‘paroxysmal AF’.

that have been proposed to enhance the success rate of atrial fibril-
lation ablation (roof line, mitral isthmus line, ‘box’ lesions consisting
of a roof/superior and inferior connection between the pulmonary
vein isolation circles, and left atrial appendage isolation). The effect-
iveness of these additional ablation interventions will require evalu-
ation in adequately sized and powered controlled trials.

 (2) Catheter ablation should be considered for symptom relief in
patients with persistent AF, especially after failed antiarrhythmic
drug therapy.
(3) Pulmonary vein isolation is a reasonable and often sufficiently
effective ablation strategy in patients undergoing a first catheter
ablation of persistent AF.
(4) Additional ablation targets should in our view not routinely be
pursued in the first procedure.
(5) Optimal management of concomitant cardiovascular conditions
should be an integral part of rhythm control therapy in patients
with persistent AF undergoing catheter ablation.
(6) Early rhythm control intervention has conceptual benefits, but
needs evaluation in controlled trials. At present, it seems rea-
sonable to not delay catheter ablation unduly after the decision
for rhythm control therapy has been taken.
What next?
There are development needs for this exciting and understudied
area in clinical electrophysiology. Among them, the following appear
of special relevance to us:
(1) There is a need to develop better technology to achieve safe
and reliable transmural lesions in the left atrium.
(2) We need to identify clinical markers for different types of AF
that allow to identify persistent AF patients who will benefit
from catheter ablation.89
(3) Research into reduction of ablation complications and develop-
ment of simple techniques to achieve PVI46 is needed.
(4) Several additional ablation strategies have been evaluated and
abandoned, while others (including promising novel ideas) are
in need of adequate evaluation in sufficiently powered con-
trolled clinical trials, e.g. in patients with recurrent AF after suc-
cessful PVI. This requires international cooperation of major
ablation centres to allow the conduct of properly powered con-
trolled trials.
