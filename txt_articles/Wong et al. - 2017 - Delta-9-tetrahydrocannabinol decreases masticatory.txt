Abstract
Background: This study investigated whether intramuscular injection
of
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC),
by
acting
on
peripheral
cannabinoid (CB) receptors, could decrease nerve growth factor (NGF)-
induced sensitization in female rat masseter muscle; a model which
mimics the symptoms of myofascial temporomandibular disorders.
Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to explore the peripheral
expression of cannabinoid receptors in the masseter muscle while
behavioural and electrophysiology experiments were employed to assess
the functional effects of intramuscular injection of THC.
Results: It was found that CB1 and CB2 receptors are expressed by
trigeminal ganglion neurons that innervate the masseter muscle and
also on their peripheral endings. Their expression was greater in
TRPV1-positive
ganglion
neurons.
Three
days
after
intramuscular
injection of NGF, ganglion neuron expression of CB1 and CB2, but
not TPRV1, was decreased. In behavioural experiments, intramuscular
injection
(10 lL)
of
THC
(1 mg/mL)
attenuated
NGF-induced
mechanical
sensitization.
No
change
in
mechanical
threshold
was
observed in the contralateral masseter muscles and no impairment of
motor function was found after intramuscular injections of THC. In
anaesthetized
rats,
the
same
concentration
of
THC
increased
the
mechanical
thresholds
of
masseter
muscle
mechanoreceptors.
Co-administration of the CB1 antagonist AM251 blocked the effect of
THC on masseter muscle mechanoreceptors while the CB2 antagonist
AM630 had no effect.
Conclusions: These results suggest that reduced inhibitory input from
the peripheral cannabinoid system may contribute to NGF-induced local
myofascial sensitization of mechanoreceptors. Peripheral application of
THC may counter this effect by activating the CB1 receptors on masseter
muscle mechanoreceptors to provide analgesic relief without central side
effects.
Significance: Our results suggest THC could reduce masticatory muscle
pain through activating peripheral CB1 receptors. Peripheral application
of cannabinoids could be a novel approach to provide analgesic relief
without central side effects.

 1. Introduction
Recent advances in cannabinoid pharmacology have
renewed
hope
in
cannabis-based
treatments
for
chronic
pain.
However,
whether
the
peripheral
endocannabinoid system can be recruited to treat
specific craniofacial pain conditions remains unclear.
There is a long history of the medicinal use of can-
nabis against pain but its use generates controversy
due to the psychoactive effects of some of its compo-
nents (Maione et al., 2013; Robson, 2014). The dis-
covery of the endocannabinoid system generated
new hope for cannabis-based analgesics (Maione
et al., 2013; Robson, 2014). For example, inhibitors
of fatty acid amide hydrolase, the primary deactivat-
ing enzyme for the endocannabinoid anandamide,
have
been
investigated
as
potential
therapeutic
agents for chronic pain, however, they have yet to
be translated to clinical application (Krustev et al.,
2014; Lodola et al., 2015). Recent studies suggest
that peripheral application of cannabinoids could be
an effective strategy for analgesia without central
side effects (Johanek et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2010;
Bagues et al., 2014; Romero-Sandoval et al., 2015).
The cause of many chronic myofascial pain disor-
ders such as myofascial temporomandibular disorders
(TMD) remains unknown (Cairns, 2010). Some evi-
dence supports the concept that it is centrally medi-
ated, while other evidence suggests that peripheral
mechanisms may also be involved; one of which is
the overproduction of nerve growth factor (NGF)
that leads to muscle sensitization in both humans
and rats (Wong et al., 2014b). Previously, we have
developed an animal model of NGF-induced muscle
pain that mimics the tender points observed in the
craniofacial regions of TMD patients (Wong et al.,
2014a,b). Many chronic myofascial pain disorders
show
a
marked
gender-related
difference
with
greater prevalence in women than men (Cairns,
2007). It has been reported that 2–3 times more
women than men suffer from TMD-related pain
(Bush
et al.,
1993;
Cairns, 2010;
Shaefer
et al.,
2013). Despite this gender-related difference, basic
and translational pain research aimed at understand-
ing muscle pain mechanisms using female animal
has been limited (Mogil and Bailey, 2010). Intramus-
cular injection of NGF induced a greater and longer
lasting sensitization in the female rats than the male
rats, suggesting that this could be an appropriate
model for chronic craniofacial muscle pain disorders
(Wong et al., 2014b). We used female rats in this
project with the aim to better represent the popula-
tion of muscle pain patients.
In this study, we investigated whether peripheral
application
of
tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC)
could
relieve NGF-induced masseter muscle sensitization
without central side effects and whether peripheral
cannabinoid receptors play a role in the effect of
THC. The results of this study indicate that periph-
eral cannabinoid receptors may be potential targets
for treatment of muscle pain and also offer new
insights into mechanism of NGF-induced muscle
sensitization.
2. Methods
2.1 Animals
Female (276–322 g, n = 35) Sprague–Dawley rats
were used for all experiments. Animals were housed
in groups of two with a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food
and water were given ad libitum. All animal proce-
dures were reviewed and approved by the University
of British Columbia Animal Care Committee.
2.2 Drugs
THC,
1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-
methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide
(AM251)
and
[6-iodo-2-methyl-1-[2-(4-morpholi-
nyl)ethyl]-1H-indol-3-yl](4-methoxyphenyl)-metha-
none
(AM630)
were
purchased
from
Cayman
Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). THC, AM251 and
AM630 were dissolved in acetonitrile, all to a con-
centration of 10 mg/mL in a stock solution. Appro-
priate volumes of each solution were evaporated
under nitrogen gas, and subsequently resolubilized
with 4% Tween 80 in isotonic saline to final concen-
trations used for injection.
2.3 Immunohistochemistry
To identify trigeminal ganglion neurons that inner-
vate the masseter muscle, the fluorescent tracer dye
Fast Blue (2%; Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA)
was injected bilaterally into the masseter muscles of
rats
(n = 5),7 days
prior
to
euthanization.
NGF
(25 lg/mL, 10 lL; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) or
vehicle (phosphate buffered saline, PBS, 10 lL) was
injected into the left and right masseter muscles,
respectively, 3 days before euthanization. Under
deep isoflurane anaesthesia, animals were perfused
with 120 mL cold saline followed by 120 mL of
paraformaldehyde
(4%).
Trigeminal
ganglia
and
masseter muscles were removed, incubated in 20%
and then 40% sucrose for 48 h each to cryoprotect
the tissue, and cut into 10 lm sections with a

 cryotome. Trigeminal ganglia sections were treated
with 5% normal goat serum in PBS for 1 h and
incubated overnight with commercially available pri-
mary antibodies against cannabinoid receptor type I
(CB1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA)
and cannabinoid receptor type II (CB2; ABCAM,
Cambridge, MA, USA), as well as transient receptor
potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV; ABCAM). Satellite glial
cells (SGCs) were identified through the use of a pri-
mary antibody against glutamine synthetase (GS;
ABCAM). Masseter muscle sections were treated
with primary antibodies against the pan-axonal mar-
ker PGP9.5 (ABCAM), CB1 and CB2 receptors as
described above. The next morning sections were
washed several times with PBS and then incubated
for 1 h at room temperature in the dark in the pres-
ence of appropriate secondary antibodies with fluo-
rescent tracers attached. After several washes in
buffer, all sections were mounted on slides with cov-
ers
slips
and
visualized
with
a
Leica,
Concord,
Ontario, Canada TCS SPE confocal microscope. Fast
Blue positive cells were counted and photographed
for estimation of cell diameter. Images from the con-
focal microscope were analysed using the image pro-
cessing program ImageJ (National Institute of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA). An area with nonspecific bind-
ing from the image was selected as the background.
The mean and standard deviation for this area were
calculated from the brightness values of the pixels by
the ImageJ program. Neurons were considered posi-
tively labelled when the average intensity of the fast
blue signal within the neuron was greater than 2
standard deviations above the mean background
intensity.
Nerve
fibres
were
considered
positive
when the intensity of the fluorescent tracer signal
for PGP 9.5 exceeded the 2 standard deviations of
the
mean
background
intensity.
The
minimum
accepted length for a PGP 9.5-labeled nerve fibre
was 1 lm in the masseter muscle. The specificity of
the antibodies was confirmed by omission of the pri-
mary antibodies. Pre-absorption of the primary anti-
body with the appropriate antigen was performed for
the CB1 antibody in a previous study (Sanford et al.,
2008), while the specificity for the CB2 antibody
was previously confirmed in knockout rats (Burston
et al., 2013).
2.4 Behavioral experiments
2.4.1 Administration of NGF and THC
Three days before the behavioural experiments, rats
received an injection of NGF (25 lg/mL, 10 lL;
Sigma) or vehicle (PBS, 10 lL) into the left and right
masseter
muscles,
respectively,
in
a
randomized
order under brief isoflurane anaesthesia. NGF has
been shown to induce local mechanical sensitization
at the site of injection which lasts from 3 h to 5 days
after injection in
the female rats (Wong et al.,
2014b). To determine the effects of peripheral appli-
cation of THC on NGF-induced sensitization, THC
(1 mg/mL) or vehicle was injected into the left
(NGF-injected) masseter muscle of rats under brief
isoflurane anaesthesia. This concentration of THC
was the lowest concentration required to reduce
hypertonic saline- induced muscle pain by local
injection in a previous study (Bagues et al., 2014).
The masseter muscle region was shaved prior to
injection and the injection sites were marked with a
permanent marker for subsequent identification. The
concentration of NGF was selected based on the con-
centration used in previous human experimental
pain studies and experiments in rats (Svensson et al.,
2003, 2008, 2010; Mann et al., 2006; Wong et al.,
2014b). The investigator was blinded to the identity
of the treatment groups until after all data were col-
lected.
2.4.2 Mechanical threshold (MT)
MT was assessed with a rigid electronic von Frey hair
(IITC Life Science, Woodland Hills, CA, USA). Before
NGF injection, rats were habituated to restraint in a
towel. The electronic von Frey hair was applied per-
pendicularly to the masseter muscle and the force
was gradually increased until the animal moved its
head away from the stimulus. The mechanical test
stimulus was applied at 1 min intervals for 5 min
and the average MT was calculated for further analy-
sis. MT was measured daily for 5 days prior to the
start of the experiment to determine that measure-
ments were stable. MT readings recorded prior to
NGF injection were used as na€
ıve baseline. After
induction of the NGF-induced sensitization, beha-
vioural
testing
was
performed
to
evaluate
the
antinociceptive effects of THC and the vehicle control
groups (n = 6/group) at 3 days after NGF injection.
On the test day, a post-NGF injection baseline (NGF
baseline) was recorded before injection of the treat-
ment groups. MT was again measured at 10, 30, 60
and 120 min after treatment injection.
2.4.3 Inverted screen test
A modified version of the inverted screen test was
performed to evaluate impaired motor function in
rats (Coughenour et al., 1977; Maxwell et al., 1993).

Peripheral CB receptors in masticatory muscle pain
H. Wong et al.
 Rats
(n = 4/group)
were
placed
on
a
screen
(185 mm 9 290 mm)
with
5-mm-diameter
holes
and the screen was slowly inverted 180 degrees until
the rats were suspended upside down on the bottom
of the screen. The animals were observed for their
ability to climb to the top of the screen in the next
60 s and were assigned to a score: (0) animals suc-
cessfully climbed to the top the screen; (1) held on
the screen upside down (2) or fell from the screen.
The rats were trained how to perform the test daily
for 3 days before they were tested. Baselines were
measured at the beginning prior to treatment and
the animals were retested at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min
after treatment (Vehicle or THC, 1 mg/mL) by intra-
muscular injection.
2.5 In vivo electrophysiology
In vivo electrophysiology recordings of single gan-
glion neurons that innervate the craniofacial muscles
were performed to investigate the mechanism of
action of peripherally injected cannabinoids. Rats
(n = 6/group)
from
the
behavioural
experiments
were used for these subsequent in vivo electrophysio-
logical experiments. Additional animals were, how-
ever, used for the THC/AM251 and THC/AM630
groups. Recordings were performed at least 7 days
after the behavioural experiments. Experiments were
conducted on the PBS-injected masseter muscles
(right side) of the rats to minimize potential residual
effects of the previous cannabinoid treatments.
Rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane (2–2.5%
in oxygen 97–98%; AErrane; Baxter) and surgically
prepared for electrophysiological recording. Heart
rate, blood pressure and body temperature were
monitored and a trachea tube was inserted for venti-
lation throughout the experiment. The hair of the
face was shaved and the animal’s head was posi-
tioned in a stereotaxic frame. A parylene-coated
tungsten microelectrode (0.10″, 2 MΩ; A-M Systems
Inc., Sequim, WA, USA) was lowered into the
trigeminal ganglion through the brain via a small
trephination in the skull. An incision was made over
the neck to expose the brain stem, and the dura was
removed to allow access for a stimulating electrode
to contact the caudal brain stem. Mechanoreceptors
innervating craniofacial muscles (masseter and tem-
poralis) were identified by mechanical probing using
a fine-tipped cotton swab. Antidromic collisions were
performed to confirm projection of the muscle fibre
to the caudal brain stem (Cairns et al., 2002; Wong
et al., 2014a). A stimulating electrode (parylene-
coated tungsten microelectrode, 0.10″, 2 MΩ; A-M
Systems Inc.) was lowered into the ipsilateral caudal
brain stem and a constant-current electrical stimulus
(100 ls
biphasic
pulse,
10–90 lA,
0.5 Hz)
was
applied to evoke antidromic action potentials. Ortho-
dromic action potentials were evoked by mechanical
stimulation of the muscle. Collision was demon-
strated by disappearance of the antidromic spike.
The straight line distance between the stimulating
and recording electrodes was divided by the latency
of the antidromic action potential to estimate con-
duction velocity. MT was assessed with an electronic
von
Frey
hair
(IITC
Life
Science)
by
applying
mechanical stimuli at 1 min intervals for 10 min to
obtain baseline threshold. After baseline measure-
ment, treatment was administered and MT was reas-
sessed at 10, 30, 60 and 120 min thereafter. At the
end of the experiments, animals were euthanized
with pentobarbital (Nembutal 100 mg/kg; Abbott
Laboratories, Chicago, IL, USA).
2.6 Data analysis
For the immunohistochemistry experiment, the fre-
quency of expression of CB1, CB2 and TRPV1,
respectively, in fast blue positive trigeminal ganglion
neurons between NGF and vehicle-injected sides was
analysed with a paired Student’s t-test. For the beha-
vioural and electrophysiological experiments, MT
from NGF and vehicle-injected sides was analysed
with a two-way repeated measures analysis of vari-
ance (ANOVA) with time and treatment as factors.
Relative mechanical activation threshold (Rel MT)
was calculated as 100 9 Post-treatment MT/Baseline
MT. Post hoc Holm Sidak’s multiple comparison tests
were
used
to
compare
postinjection
mechanical
thresholds between treatment groups at each time
point. One-way repeated measures ANOVA on ranks
was used to analyse test scores in the inverted screen
tests. A probability level of 0.05 was considered sig-
nificant for all tests. Error bars indicate standard
error of the mean on all graphs.

to

effect on TPRV1 expression was observed. Expression
of CB1 and CB2 was also found in the neuronal
fibres in the masseter muscles, confirming their pres-
ence in the nerve endings of trigeminal ganglion
neurons (Fig. 2). In the SGCs surrounding trigeminal
ganglion neurons, expression of CB1, but not CB2
was observed (Fig. 3).
3.2 Effect of intramuscular injections of THC on
NGF-induced sensitization
In the behavioural studies, intramuscular injection
of NGF decreased masseter muscle MT at 3 days after
injection by 31%, consistent with earlier studies
(Fig. 4A; Wong et al., 2014b). THC (1 mg/mL) sig-
nificantly reversed NGF-induced sensitization at 10
and 30 min after injection (Fig. 4A). No effect of any
injection was observed on the MT of masseter mus-
cles contralateral to the THC injection (Fig. 4B). No
impairment of motor functions was found in the
inverted screen test after intramuscular injections of
THC (median score for all treatments was 0).
3.3 Effect of intramuscular injections of THC on
masseter muscle nociceptors
Recordings from 24 masticatory muscle mechanore-
ceptors were undertaken (Fig. 5). The median con-
duction velocity was 7.6 m/s (25th percentile: 4.5;
75th percentile: 10.3) and the median mechanical
threshold was 34.3 g (25th percentile: 14.5; 75th
percentile: 57.8). The population was composed of
75% Ad fibres (2–12 m/s), 17% Ab fibres (>12 m/s)
and 8% C fibres (<2 m/s). Intramuscular injection of
THC (1 mg/mL) significantly increased the MT of
mechanoreceptors at 10, 30 and 60 min after injec-
tion (Fig. 6). These results from the electrophysiol-
ogy experiments parallel the results obtained from
the behavioural experiments. The effects of CB1 and
CB2 selective antagonists on this effect of THC were
examined. Co-administration of THC and the CB1
antagonist AM251 attenuated the increase in MT
mediated by THC alone and the combination was
not significantly different from vehicle administra-
tion (Fig. 6). Co-administration of THC and the CB2
antagonist AM630 was not different from THC alone.
These results suggest intramuscular injection of THC

4. Discussion
Many current drugs for the treatment of chronic
pain, in particular cannabinoids, have significant
central nervous system side (CNS) effects. One way
to circumvent these CNS side effects is to use a low
dose, local tissue administration of these drugs to
target peripheral receptors. In this regard, peripher-
ally administered cannabinoids have been proposed
as one potential solution to reduce the CNS side
effects associated with systemic administration of
these agents (Romero-Sandoval et al., 2015). In this
study, expression of both CB1 and CB2 receptors
was observed in trigeminal ganglion neurons inner-
vating the masseter muscle, providing evidence that
these receptors can be targeted for masticatory mus-
cle pain. The reduction in CB1 and CB2 receptor
expression after NGF injection suggests that this
mechanism may contribute to NGF-induced local
myofascial sensitization. In the behavioural experi-
ments,
intramuscular
injection
of
cannabinoids
reversed NGF-induced mechanical sensitization with-
out an effect on motor coordination. In the electro-
physiology
experiments,
THC
increased
the
mechanical
thresholds
of
mechanoreceptors
that
innervate the masseter muscle through peripheral
CB1 receptor activation. These results are consistent
with earlier studies which found that local adminis-
tration of THC reduced sensitization in muscle pain
conditions (Johanek et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2010;
Bagues et al., 2014; Romero-Sandoval et al., 2015).
Our results suggest that peripheral application of
cannabinoids may be effective in the treatment of
muscle pain disorders and may be a more desirable
strategy than systemic administration due to a lower
potential for CNS side effects.
There are two known endogenous cannabinoid
receptors, CB1 and CB2 (Robson, 2014). While the

speculative (Robson, 2014). CB1 receptors are pri-

expression in human myofascial tissues (Fede et al.,
2016). In this study, CB1 and CB2 receptors were
both observed in the trigeminal ganglion neurons
innervating the masseter muscles as well as on their
nerve endings in the masseter muscles. The expres-
sion of both receptors was also higher in the TRPV1-

Peripheral CB receptors in masticatory muscle pain
 expressing neurons. Since TRPV1 has been proposed
as a nociceptor-specific transducer channel, these
results suggest that CB1 and CB2 receptors may be
preferentially expressed in putative muscle nocicep-
tors, highlighting their potential as peripheral targets
of analgesia (Woolf and Ma, 2007).
NGF is a neurotrophin essential for the growth
and survival of sensory and sympathetic neurons
(Bennett, 2001; Pezet and McMahon, 2006). In
adults, it has also been found to play an important
role during injury and nociception (Price et al.,
2003; Watson et al., 2008). Previous studies showed
that NGF may induce pain through increasing the
expression of many excitatory receptors and sub-
stances associated with pain, including ion channels
and receptors such as TRPV1, and voltage-gated
sodium channels, such as ASIC3 and P2X3 (McMa-
hon and Bennett, 1999; Cheng and Ji, 2008; Watson
et al., 2008). NGF has also been found to increase
the expression of the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-
related peptide and substance P as part of the pheno-
typic switch that is proposed to occur in sensory
neurons following injury and inflammation (Woolf
and Ma, 2007; Latremoliere and Woolf, 2009). We
recently found that peripheral NMDA receptors may
also be a part of the mechanism whereby NGF
sensitizes
muscle
afferent
fibres
(Wong
et al.,
2014a). In this study, we found NGF decreased the
expression of CB1 and CB2, on masseter ganglion
neurons, suggesting that NGF may also induce sensi-
tization, in part, by reducing endogenous peripheral
inhibitory input. This result is in contrast to an ear-
lier study where the expression of CB1 receptors
increased after induction of CFA-induced inflamma-
tory pain (Amaya et al., 2006; Niu et al., 2012). This
may be understandable as NGF does not induce
inflammation (Apfel et al., 1994; Mann et al., 2006)
and could suggest that in chronic pain conditions
where there is no obvious inflammation, pain may
be mediated, in part, by a reduction in peripheral
inhibitory input, in part, through a decrease in
peripheral cannabinoid receptor expression.
Peripherally administered cannabinoids may com-
pensate for the NGF-induced decrease in CB1 and
CB2 expression to provide useful analgesia. How-
ever, one could argue that the reduction in cannabi-
noid
receptor
expression
may
reduce
the
effectiveness of these compounds. However, in this
study it was found that approximately 40% of mas-
seter ganglion neurons still expressed the CB1 recep-
tor after NGF treatment. Conditional knockout of
peripheral CB1 receptors in mice demonstrated that
cannabinoid-induced analgesia is mediated primarily
through peripheral CB1 receptors (Agarwal et al.,
2007). This is also supported by our electrophysio-
logical results. In these experiments, THC was able
to reverse the NGF-induced mechanical sensitization
of muscle mechanoreceptors through activation of
CB1 receptors but not CB2 receptors. Masseter mus-
cle injection of THC had no detectable effect on the
mechanical sensitivity of the contralateral masseter
muscle and did not impair motor function in the
inverted screen test, which indicates a local effect of
the injected THC. These results suggest that although
CB1 expression was reduced by NGF, activation of
peripheral cannabinoid receptors was sufficient to
provide effective local analgesia without systemic
effects.
We did not identify a role for CB2 receptor activa-
tion in the effect of THC on NGF-induced mechani-
cal sensitization, although it is an agonist for both
receptors. Other studies, however, have suggested
CB2 receptors are involved in the analgesic action of
THC (Quartilho et al., 2003; Pertwee, 2008; Bagues
et al., 2014). One potential explanation for the dif-
ference between this study and previous work may
be that since the CB2 receptor is primarily expressed
in immune cells, its effects are most readily demon-
strated in inflammatory pain models. Indeed, CB2
Figure 6 The line and scatter plots show the mean mechanical
threshold (MT) (�SE) of six mechanoreceptors per treatment group
following intramuscular injections of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), THC

vehicle group and #s indicates significant differences between THC

ANOVA, Holm Sidak multiple comparison test, p < 0.05). THC signifi-
cantly increased the MT of the mechanoreceptors. This effect was
attenuated by the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 but was not
affected by the CB2 antagonist AM630. These results indicate that
THC was exerting its inhibitory effect through activation of the CB1
receptor.

Peripheral CB receptors in masticatory muscle pain
H. Wong et al.
 receptors have been proposed as a target for neu-
roinflammation (Ashton and Glass, 2007; Adhikary
et al., 2011). As NGF-induced mechanical sensitiza-
tion is not associated with significant tissue inflam-
mation, it might be expected that CB2 receptor
activation would have a limited effect in this model
of myofascial pain sensitivity (Mann et al., 2006).
Interaction between the neurotrophin and the
endocannabinoid systems has been previously specu-
lated (Devesa and Ferrer-Montiel, 2014). These two
systems share many of the same intracellular sig-
nalling pathways that include phospholipase C, MAP
kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Activa-
tion of CB1 receptors has been shown to inhibit
NGF-induced sensitization of TRPV1 receptors in
mouse afferent neurons (Wang et al., 2014). Sys-
temic
administration
of
anandamide,
an
endo-
cannabinoid,
has
also
been
found
to
relieve
cutaneous
hyperalgesia
induced
by
intraplantar
injection of NGF in rats through CB1 receptor activa-
tion (Farquhar-Smith and Rice, 2003). In this study,
it was found that NGF decreased expression of
peripheral CB1 and CB2 receptors without affecting
the expression of TRPV1 receptors, suggesting a
potential
mechanism
where
the
peripheral
neu-
rotrophic and endocannabinoid systems may influ-
ence each other directly through expression of the
peripheral cannabinoid receptors. Although there are
very few reports of down-regulation of receptor
expression by NGF, it has been reported that NGF
can decrease the expression of epidermal growth fac-
tor receptors when used to induce neuronal differen-
tiation of rat pheochromocytoma cells (Cohen et al.,
2014). This particular effect of NGF is mediated by
activation of the TrkA receptor through the Ras–ex-
tracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. It
is not known whether a similar mechanism under-
lies the reduced expression of CB receptors in this
study. However, it is also important to recognize that
our finding is based on a decreased expression of CB
receptors by ganglion neurons, which may or may
not,
accurately
reflect
changes
in
CB
receptor
expression on the peripheral terminals of the affer-
ent fibres.
Cannabis has been used to treat pain for centuries.
Unfortunately,
many
pain
sufferers
who
might
derive benefit from its use find its psychoactive
effects too unpleasant. Here, we found that local
administration of THC could reverse NGF-induced
mechanical
sensitization
in
the
masseter
muscle
through activation of the CB1 receptor without
apparent CNS side effects. Intramuscular injection of
NGF produces localized muscle tenderness that is
reminiscent of the masticatory muscle pain reported
by sufferers of TMD (Cairns, 2010). Our results sug-
gest that peripheral cannabinoid administration may
be a promising approach for the treatment of chronic
masticatory muscle pain.
