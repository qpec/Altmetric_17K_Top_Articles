Abstract
Purpose of Review To explore the sequence and interaction of infancy and early childhood risk factors, particularly relating to
disturbances in the social environment, and how the consequences of such exposures can promote weight gain and obesity.
Recent Findings This review will argue that socioeconomic adversity is a key upstream catalyst that sets the stage for critical
midstream risk factors such as family strain and dysfunction, offspring insecurity, stress, emotional turmoil, low self-esteem, and
poor mental health. These midstream risk factors, particularly stress and emotional turmoil, create a more or less perfect foil for
calorie-dense junk food self-medication and subtle addiction, to alleviate uncomfortable psychological and emotional states.
Summary Disturbances in the social environment during infancy and early childhood appear to play a critical role in weight gain
and obesity, through such mechanisms as insecurity, stress, and emotional turmoil, eventually leading to junk food self-
medication and subtle addiction.

Introduction
Obesity is clearly one of the most pressing public health chal-
lenges of our time. A recent simulation study from the USA
found that by 2030, a staggering 55–60% of today’s children
will be obese [1]. Although incidence rates have generally
slowed down or even reversed in populations with higher so-
cioeconomic status (SES) [2, 3••, 4••], there are few clear signs
that this general upward trend will be reversed anytime soon,
especially for low SES groups [4••, 5]. The costs to society and
individuals are already monumental, and are set to increase
further as numbers affected and the duration of obesity expo-
sure increase [6, 7]. Indeed, the current and predicted future
situation is nothing short of a public health calamity, requiring
urgent action from individuals, organizations, corporations,
health care, and governments alike.
Obesity has proved resistant to conventional treatment,
through adaptations such as reduced metabolic rate and an
increase of appetite increasing hormones [8, 9]. Prevention
is therefore an absolutely critical strategy, theoretically by re-
ducing population exposure to common risk factors.
Identification of these risk factors, and increased understand-
ing about how those risk factors interact, is therefore vital.
Research shows that the ages between 0 and 5 years is a
critical period in the development of overweight and obe-
sity [10•, 11, 12], and that childhood overweight and obe-
sity is highly predictive of adult obesity [1, 10•]. Early
prevention efforts are therefore a clear priority [13], as is
increased understanding about infancy and early childhood
risk factors [8, 14].
The idea of childhood adversity as an independent obesity
risk factor is gaining attention, where two relatively recent
meta-analyses both found clear increases in adult obesity risk
in children exposed to abuse or maltreatment [15, 16]. In ad-
dition, childhood adversity can also, through such conse-
quences as low self-esteem, poor mental health, chronic stress,
chronic inflammation, emotional turmoil, and increased appe-
tite, influence the regulation of adipose tissue mass upwards
(body weight set-point theory) for increased security and sur-
vival [8], and lead to redistributions of peripheral body fat to
more visceral areas [17].

 Earlier pioneering work in this field found a strong as-
sociation between childhood neglect, a strong sign of a
harsh social milieu (using data from teacher proxy report),
and a subsequent obesity development [18]. Moreover, it is
already well established that childhood abuse likewise
drastically increases the risk of many of our leading causes
of death, such as mental health problems, addiction, heart
disease, stroke, several cancer forms, suicide, type 2 dia-
betes, and severe obesity [19]. In summary, the evidence is
mounting for a potent role of a harsh social environment
during infancy and early childhood in the etiology of obe-
sity and several obesity comorbidities.
While a previous review of this general topic explored the
underlying reasons behind the low SES and obesity associa-
tion [8], the current review will explore how upstream and
midstream risk factors (childhood adversity, insecurity, stress,
and emotional factors) interact with downstream risk factors,
mainly calorie-dense junk food, gradually causing the cup to
spill over (Fig. 1). Emphasis will also be placed on clarifying
the strongly habit-forming and probably addictive properties
of junk food, particularly for individuals with increased stress
and emotional turmoil, as a result of a harsh family environ-
ment during early childhood.
Socioeconomic Adversity
Having a low socioeconomic status is arguably one of the
strongest risk factors for developing obesity (in countries that
have made the transition to Western lifestyles) [2, 20, 21], and
many other adverse health conditions, including diabetes, can-
cer, and mental health problems [22].
There is a growing body of literature suggesting that the
association between socioeconomic status and development
of childhood obesity is growing in strength with an ever wid-
ening gap in obesity rates between low and high SES groups
[3••, 23–26]. In many developed countries, the rates of child-
hood obesity have stabilized or even been reduced in higher
SES groups, whereas lower SES groups have generally seen a
steady increase [3••, 23–26]. This clearly highlights the role of
low SES as a critical risk factor. As the income gap continues
to widen in our societies, we can expect the adverse influence
of low SES to increase even further, particularly for countries
where obesity is already well entrenched.
There are several main consequences of low SES that are of
particular relevance to obesity: mental health (depression, anx-
iety), low self-esteem and self-worth, feeling disempowered,
insecurity, stress, negative belief systems, and negative emo-
tions (anger, apathy, hopelessness, frustration, shame, guilt,
etc.) [27••, 28–31]. Another hallmark of low SES is financial
hardship, making healthy lifestyle choices less accessible, in-
directly promoting unhealthy lifestyle choices, such as con-
suming unhealthy and usually calorie-dense foods, a lack of
physical activity, and less opportunity for healthy growth and
development, such as education [25, 26]. Another stamp of
low SES is a lack of higher education and critical thinking,
which promotes susceptibility to junk food marketing [26, 32].
Family Dysfunction
Starting a family and becoming a parent is a major life-
changing event that drastically elevates demands and respon-
sibilities, not least financially but also in the role as the

 primary provider of social, mental, and emotional develop-
ment for children. Families where parents have low SES is
not only characterized by financial lack, but often a lack of
cohesion, low awareness or prioritization of healthy lifestyles,
neglect, relationship discord, mental health problems, low
self-esteem, and addiction, resulting in a harsh and insecure
social environment for infants and young children [27••, 33].
In short, the desired social, psychological, and emotional
nurturing of the child may be disturbed during some of its
most critical developmental periods [27••]. It is well
established that children growing up under these circum-
stances are at much increased risk of various adverse health
outcomes relevant to obesity development, such as mental
health problems, addiction, and chronic inflammation [34,
35]. Using a retrospective study design, Felitti et al.
(Adverse Childhood Experiences Study) were one of the first
to demonstrate the potent role of family dysfunction and ad-
verse childhood experiences on numerous health outcomes
[19]. The list of adverse childhood exposures included psy-
chological, physical or sexual abuse, parental violence, sub-
stance abuse, mental illness, and imprisonment. More than
half the respondents reported at least one adverse exposure,
with a quarter reporting at least two adverse exposures. There
were consistent and graded associations between adverse
childhood experiences and outcomes such as alcoholism
(OR: 7.4), (comparing four or more exposures vs none), drug
injection (10.3), mental illness (4.6), attempted suicide (12.2),
bronchitis (3.9), ischemic heart disease (2.2), stroke (2.4),
smoking (2.2), poor self-rated health (2.2), and severe obesity
(OR: 1.6), all statistically significant. The consistency and
strength of these associations clearly highlight a very toxic
role of childhood abuse in adult health development.
Offspring Insecurity, Stress, and Emotional
Turmoil
Infancy and early childhood is when humans are most vulner-
able and reliant on external nurturing (including breastfeeding),
security, attachment, and support, since young children have
not yet acquired adequate protective mechanisms (resilience,
coping skills, self-esteem, independence, etc.).
Since the path to obesity usually starts during early child-
hood [4••, 10•], combined with the inverse association be-
tween SES and obesity, we need to understand more about
the effects of family adversity on the offspring. Infants and
children are highly impressionable, and tend to internalize
much of their external environment, thereby increasing the
risk of uncomfortable psychological and emotional states as
a result of family stress and strain [36].
Consequences of a dysfunctional infancy and childhood in-
clude an exaggerated sensitivity to social, physical, and emo-
tional stressors (slamming doors, harsh language, violence,
social distance, lack of warmth and affection, neglect, etc.),
resulting in [37] insecurity and anxiety, mental health prob-
lems, negative emotions (fear, anger, apathy, abandonment,
hopelessness, disappointment, boredom, grief, shame, empti-
ness, guilt, bitterness, jealousy, tiredness, self-pity, resigned,
etc.), behavioral and learning problems, low self-esteem, low
self-worth, low self-efficacy, sleeping problems, etc. [8, 27••,
38, 39•]. The emotional toll of exposure to verbal or physical
aggression between parents has been shown in prospective
studies in infants and young children [37, 40]. Without support
from other important others or adequate resilience, such expo-
sure will result in more or less chronic stress (elevated cortisol
and ghrelin), chronic inflammation and insecurity and uncom-
fortable emotional states [8, 27, 33, 38, 39•, 41, 42].
Formation of Junk Food Self-Medication
Habits and Subtle Addiction
Once stress, insecurity, and emotional turmoil have been
established at an early age, the individual will naturally seek
relief from these uncomfortable states, with little interference
from cognitive processes, through the brain-reward system
[17, 43]. Junk food, given its hedonic properties through an
exaggerated energy density [44, 45], is a readily available
form of self-medication through hedonic binge eating, creat-
ing strong habits through changes in the amygdala and hippo-
campus [17, 46–49]. While the concept of food addiction is
debated [50], the term has nevertheless gained some recogni-
tion, with one study reporting 23% of children 5–12 years
(data collected through parent proxy), being classified as
addicted to food, and a positive association with obesity [51].
Children in disharmonious families are therefore at greater
risk, compared to children who grew up in harmonious fam-
ilies, to rapidly adopt effective but ultimately dysfunctional
eating habits where they regularly consume energy dense junk
food for emotional and stress-related relief and pleasure. [17]
Once such habits have been established, it is unlikely to
change as a result of cognitive interference [17, 47, 48].
Untangling a Fundamentally Flawed
Internal/External Environment Interaction
Highly palatable and emotionally rewarding junk food is per-
vasive in our external environment, constantly providing cues
for consumption much beyond our metabolic need. Obese
individuals have been shown to be more affected than normal
weight individuals by external cues, feel stronger cravings,
and consume greater portions after exposure [52]. Research
also suggests that the hedonic responses and adaptations in the
brain from eating palatable junk food are similar to more con-
ventional drug abuse [43, 53].
206
Curr Obes Rep (2018) 7:204–209
 Even though the triggered consumption of junk food
through internal factors like stress, elevated ghrelin levels,
and uncomfortable emotions, is not as potent as more chemi-
cally induced addiction, junk food can nevertheless be de-
scribed as a type of subtle and arguably more insidious type
of addiction or addictive-like behavior [52]. This is both good
and bad for the individual: cravings and withdrawal symptoms
are not as powerful, but this type of addictive behavior may also
be harder to detect and counter, for example through therapy.
Another vastly complicating factor is that junk food, com-
pared to regular drugs, is much more available, cheaper, and
marketed extensively. In addition, since food is necessary to
our survival, there exist infinitely more opportunities to trigger
a level of hedonic food consumption much beyond our meta-
bolic and nutritional need, for example through adding sugar,
fat, and salt to increase palatability and initiate binge-like eating
behavior.
In summary, many individuals of varying ages today find
themselves with unresolved internal stress and uncomfortable
emotions, particularly during demanding or adverse living
conditions, existing in an external environment that is more
or less constantly inviting a quick, cheap, and highly available
solution: energy dense ultra-processed junk food, inviting a
more or less addictive, emotionally triggered eating behavior.
Improving Treatment and Prevention Efforts
An important historical lesson that needs to be considered is
that risk factors like low SES and emotional turmoil have
existed long before the rise of obesity. However, drawing on
the filling-of-the-cup metaphor (Fig. 1), the obesity cup was
not spilling over until the introduction and growth of ultra-
processed junk food in all its many different forms from the
1960s and onwards [54]. It is therefore reasonable to propose
that low SES and emotional turmoil merely set the stage for
weight gain and obesity, whereas the introduction of energy-
dense junk food can be considered a direct cause of weight
gain and obesity through its influence on energy homeostasis.
Prevention of obesity has been tried, although given the
current toxicity of the external environment, combined with
unresolved stress and negative emotions in a large segment of
the population, these efforts (while laudable) have been limit-
ed in scope. Hitherto, the main prevention strategies have been
raising public awareness, improved diet and increased physi-
cal activity [55]. Given that there are many examples of obe-
sity rates that have generally slowed or even reversed in high
SES strata [2, 3], one could argue that such simple strategies
have had some success in affluent and well educated popula-
tions, quite possibly due to less exposure to socioeconomic
adversity, stress, and emotional turmoil.
What remains a much greater challenge is to prevent obe-
sity for low SES groups, particularly children in dysfunctional
families. This is arguably where the need for prevention is
greatest, and where considerable more effort urgently needs
to be mobilized, for example in schools and kindergartens and
families under financial and social strain [56, 57]. In theory,
we could improve outcomes by focusing more on upstream
and midstream risk factors, such as reducing poverty, increas-
ing education, and providing support for families, combined
with more traditional downstream drivers, i.e., more balanced
nutrition, reduced junk food marketing, and increased physi-
cal activity.
Given the general long-term failure of calorie-centered diet
and exercise schemes, and the classic pattern of weight loss
and regain [9], suggesting the presence of a body weight set-
point [8] it is urgent that obesity treatment programs delve
deeper into psychological and emotional aspects so that weight
loss maintenance can be improved. Treatment outcomes for
obesity could be improved by targeting the causes behind ex-
cessive eating, such as maladaptive junk food self-medication
habits formed during childhood or other stressful and emotion-
al events thereafter (losing a job, divorce, grief, etc.).
It is here speculated that these inner perturbations, mainly
emotional, and related junk food habits and associated
addiction/self-medication are much more common than many
clinicians and patients realize, indicating a need for more re-
search in this promising area to find more definitive solutions
to obesity. Obtaining data on infancy and early childhood so-
cial stressors is challenging, although not impossible, for ex-
ample, through retrospective investigations, [15, 16] teacher or
relative proxy, [18] or register-based investigations [58–60].
Conclusions
Infancy and early childhood is a critical period in the devel-
opment of overweight and obesity. There appears to be a
highly toxic trio of risk factors in socioeconomic adversity
(upstream), offspring stress and emotional turmoil (mid-
stream), and subtle junk food self-medication to alleviate un-
comfortable emotional states (downstream). Over time, this
results in energy homeostasis disruptions, weight gain, and
obesity. The effectiveness of childhood prevention efforts
may be improved by including more upstream and midstream
risk factors, as a complement the more established improved
diet and exercise programs.
