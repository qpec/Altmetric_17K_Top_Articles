SUMMARY
Stimulus processing in fear conditioning is con-
strained
by
parvalbumin
interneurons
(PV-INs)
through inhibition of principal excitatory neurons.
However, the contributions of PV-IN microcircuits to
inputgatingand long-term plasticityin thefear system
remain unknown. Here we interrogate synaptic con-
nections between afferent pathways, PV-INs, and
principal excitatory neurons in the basolateral amyg-
dala. We find that subnuclei of this region are popu-
lated two functionally distinct PV-IN networks. PV-
INs in the lateral (LA), but not the basal (BA), amygdala
possess complex dendritic arborizations, receive
potent excitatory drive, and mediate feedforward inhi-
bition onto principal neurons. After fear conditioning,
PV-INs exhibit nucleus- and target-selective plas-
ticity, resulting in persistent reduction of their excit-
atory input and inhibitory output in LA but not BA.
These data reveal previously overlooked specializa-
tions of amygdala PV-INs and indicate specific circuit
mechanisms for inhibitory plasticity during the encod-
ing of associative fear memories.
INTRODUCTION
Aversive memories acquired by classical conditioning provide
insight into emotional learning under normal conditions as well
as pathological states, such as posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) (Mahan and Ressler, 2012). Cellular models of fear
learning place a great deal of emphasis on amygdala excitatory
neuronal plasticity (Janak and Tye, 2015; Johansen et al., 2011).
However, many studies posit that co-regulation of excitation and
inhibition may be important for network stability and that excita-
tion:inhibition (E:I) imbalance may be a factor in some psychiatric
conditions (Dorrn et al., 2010; House et al., 2011; Katagiri et al.,
2007; Vogels et al., 2011). Notably, decreased GABA levels as
well as GABA receptor binding and polymorphisms have been
associated with PTSD (Bremner et al., 2000; Feusner et al.,
2001; Geuze et al., 2008; Meyerhoff et al., 2014; Pennington
et al., 2014; Rossi et al., 2009; Rosso et al., 2014), and reduced
GABA levels are predictive of disease progression (Vaiva et al.,
2006; Vaiva et al., 2004). Changes in inhibitory synaptic markers
suggest that plasticity of GABAergic transmission in the basolat-
eral amygdala may also be a feature of aversive memory forma-
tion under normal conditions (Chhatwal et al., 2005; Heldt and
Ressler, 2007; Lin et al., 2011). Although ex vivo stimulation of
amygdala brain slices has been shown to induce long-term plas-
ticity in undefined GABAergic populations (Bauer and LeDoux,
2004; Mahanty and Sah, 1998; Polepalli et al., 2010; Shin et al.,
2006; Szinyei et al., 2000), it remains unknown whether specific
GABAergic cell types exhibit plasticity associated with emotional
learning.
The majority of GABAergic synaptic inhibition throughout
the forebrain is thought to originate from a heterogeneous pop-
ulation of locally projecting interneurons. Within the basolateral
amygdala, more than half of inhibitory synapses formed onto
principal excitatory neurons are associated with PV-INs (Muller
et al., 2006), which are considered to exert powerful control
over the firing of these cells through dense somatic and axo-ax-
onic synaptic terminals (Hu et al., 2014). Recently, in vivo manip-
ulations within the basolateral amygdala (Wolff et al., 2014)
as well as neocortical regions (Courtin et al., 2014; Letzkus
et al., 2011) have implicated PV-INs in fear acquisition and
expression through cue-related inhibition and disinhibition of
principal excitatory neurons. Therefore, it is important to under-
stand the circuit mechanisms underlying PV-IN recruitment and
resulting excitatory neuronal inhibition as well as to determine
whether fear conditioning generates persistent alterations in
PV-IN function.
We utilized parvalbumin-specific Cre driver mice as well as op-
togenetic-assisted electrophysiology to investigate the proper-
ties and experience-dependent plasticity of PV-IN microcircuits.
We report that function and plasticity of PV-INs varies by nucleus
location within basolateral amygdala and that fear conditioning
leads to downregulation of PV-IN transmission predominantly
within microcircuits that mediate feedforward inhibition from
sensory afferent pathways.
RESULTS
Uniquely Robust Afferent Excitation of Lateral Amygdala
PV-INs
To selectively target PV-INs for in vitro electrophysiology, we
crossed R26-STOP-eYFP reporter mice to the PV-IRES-Cre
driver line to selectively express enhanced yellow fluorescent

 protein (eYFP) in PV-INs. Given a previous report that only �60%
of PV-positive cells in the basolateral amygdala co-express
GABA (McDonald and Mascagni, 2001), we sought to determine
the specificity of Cre-mediated recombination by quantifying
double immunofluorescence staining with antibodies against
parvalbumin and GABA (Figures 1A and S1). More than 90% of
eYFP-positive cells in the basolateral amygdala co-expressed
both PV and GABA (Figure S1), demonstrating that this Cre line
is highly selective for GABAergic PV-INs in this brain region.
During classical conditioning, a benign auditory conditioned
stimulus (CS) is paired with a naturally aversive unconditioned
stimulus (US), forming an associative memory that links the CS
and US. In vivo studies have found that amygdala PV-INs
respond differentially to sensory stimulation with increased firing
to auditory stimuli (Wolff et al., 2014) and decreased firing to foot-
shock (Wolff et al., 2014) and other noxious stimuli (Bienvenu
et al., 2012). However, it is unknown whether PV-INs are directly
modulated by afferent pathways conveying CS activity. To
address this question, we performed whole-cell recordings
from PV-INs and neighboring principal neurons during stimula-
tion of subcortical and cortical sensory afferent pathways, which
traverse the internal and external capsules, respectively. We first
investigated the input/output (I/O) relationship of compound
postsynaptic currents consisting of monosynaptic excitatory
postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and disynaptic feedforward
inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) at increasing stimulus
intensities (Figures 1B–1K). While there was no difference in
the I/O slope of IPSCs between populations, the I/O relation of
monosynaptic EPSCs from both subcortical and cortical affer-
ents was far steeper in LA PV-INs compared to their glutamater-
gic neighbors (Figure 1G; two-way ANOVA, main effect of neuron
type, F(1,22) = 30.89, p < 0.0001), indicating far greater excitatory
drive from these pathways in PV-INs. While converging excita-
tion from the subcortical and cortical pathways to the LA is hy-
pothesized to be a key mediator of learning-induced synaptic
plasticity (Sigurdsson et al., 2007), cortical neurons also send
axon collaterals to BA (Sah et al., 2003; Turner and Herkenham,
1991). To determine whether these inputs exhibit similar po-
tency, we investigated the I/O relationship of BA cortical synaptic
currents (Figures 1H–1K). Unlike in LA, PV-INs and principal neu-
rons in BA exhibited similar I/O slope of both monosynaptic
EPSCs and feedforward IPSCs (Figure 1K). We then calcu-
lated an index of I/O slopes (calculated as I/O slope EPSC/ I/O
slope IPSC) as a measure of E:I balance for LA and BA neurons.
PV-INs in LA exhibited greater E:I index compared to PV-INs in
BA as well as to principal neurons in both nuclei (Figure 1L;
two-way ANOVA, main effect of neuron type, F(1,33) = 27.13,
p < 0.0001; main effect of nucleus, F(2,33) = 3.76, p = 0.03; inter-
action, F(2,33) = 6.47, p = 0.004). Importantly, EPSC onset latency
was similar across cells and nuclei (Figure 1M), indicating that
these responses shared a monosynaptic mechanism.
To determine whether differences in PV-IN anatomy could ac-
count for nucleus-specific excitatory drive, we performed mor-
phological reconstructions of biocytin-filled PV-INs (Figure 1N).
While soma and primary dendrite characteristics were compara-
ble between nuclei, PV-INs in LA possessed twice as many den-
dritic branches (t(18) = 3.09, p = 0.006) as those in BA, resulting in
increased dendritic length (t(18) = 2.27, p = 0.04; Figure 1O).
Furthermore, truncated dendrites were very infrequent and
the total number of such artifacts was similar between nuclei
(LA = 4; BA = 3), indicating that the observed differences in
physiology and morphology were not attributable to slice
preparation.
PV-INs Meditate Feedforward Inhibition in Lateral but
Not Basal Amygdala
Given the potent excitatory drive onto LA PV-INs, we hypothe-
sized that PV-INs may generate greater feedforward inhi-
bition onto principal neurons in LA compared to BA. To test
this hypothesis, we harnessed the power of optogenetics to
silence PV-INs during afferent stimulation while recording feed-
forward IPSCs. Conditional expression of the GFP-tagged
enhanced light-driven inhibitory proton pump Archaerhodop-
sin-3.0 (eArch3.0; Chow et al., 2010) in PV-IRES-Cre mice
resulted in GFP expression in both the soma and axonal arbors
of PV-INs (Figures S2A and S2B). Whole-cell recordings in
eArch3.0-expressing cells confirmed yellow light-induced (l =
590 nm) neuronal silencing (Figures S2C–S2E). Notably, PV-INs
escaped voltage clamp and generated rebound action currents
following light offset at every stimulus intensity (Figure S2C).
To evoke monosynaptic EPSCs and feedforward IPSCs, prin-
cipal neurons were clamped at membrane potentials of �70 mV
and 0 mV, respectively, during stimulation of subcortical and
cortical afferents. Feedforward IPSCs were abolished by the
GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin as well as the AMPA/kai-
nate receptor antagonist CNQX (Figure 2B). In addition, the
onset latency of feedforward IPSCs was delayed relative to
EPSCs (independent samples t test, t(36) = 11.01, p < 0.0001),
consistent with a disynaptic circuit mechanism (Figure 2C).
Having validated our approach, we patched onto principal
neurons in mice with conditional eArch3.0 expression in PV-
INs and recorded feedforward IPSCs evoked by subcortical or
cortical afferent stimulation in the presence or absence of yellow
light (Figure 2A). Feedforward IPSCs from both pathways were
attenuated by silencing PV-INs in LA (Figures 2D–2G; paired
samples t test, subcortical: t(13) = 3.59, p = 0.003; cortical: t(7) =
2.57, p = 0.03). Consistent with low cortical excitatory drive
onto BA PV-INs (Figure 1L), PV-IN silencing did not affect the
amplitude of feedforward IPSCs in this nucleus (Figures 2I and
2J; paired samples t test, t(11) = 0.05, p = 0.96).
Consistent with our observation of rebound action currents in
eArch3.0-expressing cells (Figure S2C), we also observed corre-
sponding rebound IPSCs in principal neurons at LED offset (Fig-
ures 2E, 2G, and 2J). Interestingly, we found that peak rebound
amplitude positively correlated with reduction of feedforward
IPSC amplitude by LED illumination (Figure 2H; linear regression,
F(1,20) = 29.09, p < 0.0001). Since rebound amplitude partly re-
flects the number of viable eArch3.0-infected PV-INs in our
recording field, this further indicates that PV-INs are readily
engaged in feedforward inhibition in the LA.
Fear Conditioning Induces Nucleus-Specific Alterations
in PV-IN Synaptic Input
To determine whether fear learning alters PV-IN properties, we
conducted whole-cell recordings in PV-INs after auditory fear
conditioning, which entailed paired or unpaired presentations

 of an auditory tone (CS) and footshock (US). We confirmed that
auditory fear was specific to the paired condition, since CS-
evoked freezing was observed 24 hr later in mice that received
paired but not unpaired training (Figure S3). All electrophysiolog-
ical recordings were obtained 24 hr after training from a different
set of animals in which retrieval was omitted in order to exclude
the possibility of memory extinction or reconsolidation. An anal-
ysis of miniature (m) EPSCs and mIPSCs from paired, unpaired,
and naive mice at this time point revealed nucleus-specific alter-
ations in PV-INs that were correlated with auditory fear encoding
(Figure 3). The frequency of mEPSCs differed between condi-
tions in LA (one-way ANOVA, F(2,22) = 3.78, p = 0.04) but not in
BA (one-way ANOVA, F(2,33) = 2.34, p = 0.11; Figures 3B–3D
and 3I–3K). In LA PV-INs, mEPSC frequency was reduced in
paired (p = 0.008), but not in unpaired (p = 0.74), mice compared
to naive controls. In contrast, the frequency of mIPSCs differed
between conditions in BA (one-way ANOVA, F(2,32) = 4.42, p =
0.02) but not in LA (one-way ANOVA, F(2,22) = 0.31, p = 0.74;Fig-
ures 3E–3G and 3L–3N). In BA PV-INs, mIPSC frequency was
increased in paired (p = 0.03), but not unpaired (p = 0.48), mice
relative to naive controls. Fear conditioning did not affect the
amplitude or kinetics of mEPSCs or mIPSCs. However, indepen-
dent of fear conditioning, these properties were strongly affected
by nucleus location of PV-INs (Figure S4).
The above changes suggest that PV-INs are modulated by a
nucleus-specific adjustment of their presynaptic input. Given
robust excitation of PV-INs by amygdala afferents (Figure 1),
we questioned whether excitatory presynaptic plasticity could
be attributed to these pathways. As an assay of glutamate
release probability, we measured the paired pulse ratio (PPR)
of EPSCs evoked by subcortical and cortical stimulation.

after unpaired training (Figure 4E), but evidently this was not suf-
ficient to enhance overall excitation onto LA PV-INs (Figure 3B).

cific, we measured PPR of cortical EPSCs in BA PV-INs. This

 revealed no change in glutamate release in trained animals (Fig-
ures 4G–4I), consistent with a lack of modulation of mEPSC fre-
quency by learning in BA PV-INs (Figure 3I).
Presynaptic Origins of Subcortical and Cortical Afferent
Plasticity
Although electrical stimulation of the internal and external cap-
sules is presumed to recruit glutamatergic axons from sensory
thalamus and cortex, respectively, we sought to characterize
this circuitry using region- and cell-selective tools. To determine
the presynaptic origins of PV-IN innervation, we conducted unbi-
ased Cre-dependent monosynaptic circuit tracing (Watabe-
Uchida et al., 2012; Wickersham et al., 2007). AAVs encoding
conditional expression of the TVA receptor and rabies glycopro-
tein (G) were unilaterally injected into the basolateral amygdala of
PV-IRES-Cre mice, restricting subsequent infection of G-deleted
rabies virus (RVdG) pseudotyped with the envelop protein A
(EnvA) to PV-INs and their retrograde monosynaptic contacts
(Figure 5A). In addition to other subcortical and cortical regions
(Figure S5), amygdala PV-INs received robust innervation from
the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and the temporal associa-
tion cortex (TeA) (Figures 5B and 5C). These regions are known
to convey auditory input to amygdala, and their axon terminals
are presumed to be involved in plasticity of internal and external
capsule synaptic responses in amygdala excitatory neurons
(LeDoux, 2000).
To investigate functional synaptic connectivity between MGN/
TeA and amygdala PV-INs, we targeted these areas with injec-
tions of an AAV encoding eYFP-tagged channelrhodopsin 2
(ChR2-eYFP) driven by the CaMKII promoter in PV-IRES-Cre:Ai9
double transgenic mice, in which tdTomato expression is local-
ized to PV-INs. Following these injections, eYFP+ terminals
were observed in the basolateral amygdala complex. However,
MGN terminals were largely restricted to LA, whereas TeA termi-
nals could be observed in both LA and BA (Figures 5D and 5E).
Terminal stimulation evoked polysynaptic EPSCs in PV-INs
(Figure 5F), likely the result of strong local excitatory connections
to PV-INs. To isolate monosynaptic currents, we blocked
NMDA receptors with saturating CPP (10 mM) and AMPA re-
ceptors with subsaturating CNQX (1 mM). Resulting optic-
evoked EPSCs (oEPSCs) could be completely abolished with
saturating CNQX (10 mM; Figure 5F). Consistent with anatomical
labeling, blue-light stimulation of MGN terminals resulted in
monosynaptic oEPSCs in the vast majority of LA PV-INs (36/
41), but no responses were detected in BA PV-INs (0/10). In
contrast, oEPSCs were observed in both LA (28/35) and BA
(27/30) PV-INs during TeA terminal stimulation (Figure 5G). Onset
latencies of oEPSCs were consistent with monosynaptic trans-
mission (Figure 5H).
We next measured PPR of oEPSCs to determine whether
MGN and TeA afferent plasticity could account for learning-
dependent changes in glutamate release (Figure 4). Surprisingly,
this revealed no effect of fear conditioning on PPR at MGN syn-
apses onto LA PV-INs (Figures 5I and 5J). However, consistent
with the results of electrical stimulation (Figures 4D–4I), PPR of
TeA oEPSCs was increased in paired animals relative to both
naive and unpaired controls in LA (repeated-measures ANOVA,
main effect of group, F(2,72) = 12.03, p = 0.0002) but not BA
PV-INs (Figures 5K–5N). These data confirm the nucleus speci-
ficity of PV-IN afferent plasticity in the auditory cortical pathway
but suggest that plasticity of internal capsule responses is not
attributable to auditory thalamic inputs.
Nucleus- and Synapse-Specific Reduction of GABA
Release from PV-INs
Previous studies suggest that changes in inhibitory transmission
may occur after fear conditioning, but this work relied mainly on
analysis of GABA receptors from amygdala lysates (Chhatwal
et al., 2005; Heldt and Ressler, 2007; Lin et al., 2011). It therefore
remains unclear whether fear encoding alters GABA transmis-
sion within specific microcircuits. To enable stimulation of syn-
apses formed by PV-INs, we injected Cre-inducible AAV vectors
encoding ChR2-eYFP into PV-IRES-Cre mice, resulting in somal
and axonal eYFP expression in PV-INs (Figures 6A and 6B) and
blue-light-driven action potential generation (Figure 6C). Consis-
tent with selective recombination in PV-INs (Figures 1A and S1),
we verified that optic stimulation in these mice did not result in
non-GABAergic transmission (Figures 6D–6F). Nevertheless,
subsequent experiments were conducted in the presence of
glutamate receptor antagonists. We used paired-pulse optic
stimulation (l = 470 nm) to determine whether fear conditioning
leads to changes in GABA release from PV-INs onto neighboring
principal neurons. Repeated-measures ANOVA revealed that
PPR differed between conditions in the LA (repeated-measures
ANOVA, main effect of group, F(2,68) = 26.13, p < 0.001) but not
in the BA. In LA, PPR was increased in paired, but not unpaired,
animals relative to naive controls. This decrease in GABA release
was at least partly specific to PV-IN inputs because IPSCs
evoked by local field stimulation were not modulated by training
(Figures S6A–S6C).
To determine whether PV-IN-specific plasticity corresponds
to an overall reduction of inhibition onto LA principal neurons,
we collected spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) from these cells after
fear conditioning. Consistent with a previous report (Lin et al.,
2011), both sIPSC frequency (one-way ANOVA, F (2,51) =
11.17, p = 0.0001) and amplitude (one-way ANOVA, F(2,51) =
6.80, p = 0.003) was decreased in LA of animals that received
paired training (Figures S6D–S6G). However, no changes in
sIPSC properties were observed in BA principal neurons (Figures
S6H–S6K). While our data suggest that decreased GABA release
from PV-INs may contribute to reduced sIPSC frequency in LA, it
is important to consider that these events reflect the cumulative
action of GABA transmission not only from PV-INs but also from
other inhibitory cell types.
Given the dense innervation of PV-INs by other PV-INs in the BA
(Muller et al., 2005; Woodruff and Sah, 2007), we next questioned
whether the observed changes in GABA release are specific to
glutamatergic targets, in particular because fear conditioning
altered mIPSC frequency in BA PV-INs (Figure 3L). To facilitate
fluorescence-based targeting
of PV-INs without activating
ChR2, we injected Cre-dependent AAV-ChR2 into the amygdala
of PV-IRES-Cre:Ai9 double transgenic mice (Figure 6K). This
strategy allowed us to use non-overlapping LED spectra for PV-
IN visualization and ChR2 excitation (Figure 6L). PPR analysis of
PV-IN/PV-IN oIPSCs revealed no learning-induced differences
in GABA release in LA or BA (Figures 6M–6P), indicating that, in

 addition to being nucleus-specific, learning-dependent changes
in PV-IN inhibition exhibit target selectivity.
A previous report found that fear conditioning induces alter-
ations in GABA receptor expression in the lateral amygdala
that are reversible by extinction (Lin et al., 2011). Therefore, we
postulated that GABA release properties might exhibit similar
bidirectional regulation. However, increased PPR of PV-IN
IPSCs was not reversed by extinction training (Figure S7).
Intrinsic Excitability of Basolateral Amygdala PV-INs Is
Unaltered by Fear Memory Encoding
While synapse-selective changes can alter the relationship of
PV-INs to specific presynaptic and postsynaptic targets, firing
rate plasticity could render PV-INs more or less excitable and
thus impact their general integration. To evaluate this possibility,
we examined action potential discharge in PV-INs in response to
somatic current injections after fear conditioning. No experi-
ence-dependent differences in firing frequency were observed
in LA or BA (Figures 7A–7F). In naive animals, however, PV-INs
in BA were more excitable than those in LA (Figure 7G), exhibiting
reduced rheobase current (independent samples t test, t(23) =
2.19, p = 0.04) and increased firing frequency (repeated-mea-
sure ANOVA, main effect of nucleus, F(1, 207) = 17.81, p =
0.0003). This nucleus-specific difference is likely attributable to
increased cell size, as inferred from a difference in online capac-
itance measurements from PV-INs (LA 103.00 ± 32.48 pF;
BA 69.17 ± 24.13 pF; independent-samples t test, t(30) = 3.12,
p = 0.004). No other differences in passive membrane properties
were observed. Likewise, no differences were observed in indi-
vidual spike characteristics (including threshold, amplitude,
duration, or afterhyperpolization; Figures 7H–7K).
DISCUSSION
With the aid of cell-selective reporters and optogenetic tools, we
achieved several novel insights into amygdala PV-IN function.
First, the amygdala is populated by two distinct networks of
PV-INs defined by their nucleus location, dendritic complexity,
and potency of afferent excitation. Second, these striking differ-
ences correlate with the preferential engagement of LA, but not
BA, PV-INs in afferent-evoked feedforward inhibition. Third,
fear memory encoding results in selective functional downregu-
lation of LA PV-IN microcircuitry through plasticity of both
afferent input as well as GABA release. Importantly, input plas-
ticity could be localized in part to projections from TeA, an audi-
tory cortical region that displays increased CS-related activity af-
ter fear acquisition (Quirk et al., 1997). Together, our studies
point to multimodal plasticity of discrete PV-IN microcircuits as
potentially integral to aversive memory encoding. Decreased
PV-IN activity would be expected to enhance recruitment of
amygdala excitatory projection neurons and corresponding
fear-related behaviors by sensory stimulation.
Several recent studies indicate that feedforward engagement
of PV-INs in the cortex is pathway-specific (Delevich et al., 2015;
Lee et al., 2014; Li et al., 2014; Rock and Apicella, 2015; Yang
et al., 2013). Here we show that such differential recruitment
also occurs among amygdala PV-IN subpopulations within the
same afferent pathway and is correlated with PV-IN morpholog-
ical and physiological specialization. A likely explanation for
increased excitatory drive in LA PV-INs is that they possess
more dendritic compartments and a corresponding greater num-
ber of afferent synapses. On the other hand, the lack of feedfor-
ward inhibition from BA PV-INs is consistent with anatomical
data suggesting that amygdala PV-INs are minimally targeted
by cortical afferents (Smith et al., 2000), even though our results
establish that the majority of BA PV-INs can be driven by cortical
stimulation. However, this and other studies have largely
focused on BA PV-INs, neglecting a comparatively sparse pop-
ulation of LA PV-INs that apparently compensate for their smaller
numbers with greater excitatory drive. Indeed, while our viral in-
jections led to eArch3.0 expression in an average of only two to
four LA PV-INs per brain slice (Figure S2A), light-evoked sup-
pression of these cells was surprisingly effective at reducing
feedforward inhibition. Potent recruitment of PV-INs by subcor-
tical and cortical pathways may in part explain the relative
silence of LA, compared to other amygdala nuclei, when
sampled by in vivo electrodes (Gaudreau and Pare
´ , 1996).
Such properties also make PV-INs a potentially powerful sub-
strate for experience-dependent gain modulation of amygdala
input.
Past research has established an important role for excitatory
synaptic strengthening within amygdala afferent pathways dur-
ing the encoding of cued fear associations (Janak and Tye,
2015; Johansen et al., 2011; Nabavi et al., 2014). Although far
less advanced, research into amygdala inhibitory transmission
has suggested that memory encoding also alters GABAergic
neuronal substrates (Chhatwal et al., 2005; Heldt and Ressler,
2007; Lin et al., 2011). Interestingly, whereas excitation and

 inhibition are co-upregulated in ex vivo preparations during the
expression of long-term potentiation (Lamsa et al., 2005), our
work indicates that glutamatergic (Arruda-Carvalho and Clem,
2014; Clem and Huganir, 2010, 2013) and GABAergic function
(present study) are modified in opposite directions following
emotional learning. In contrast to excitatory neuronal plasticity,
which involves presynaptic and postsynaptic alterations as
well as changes in membrane excitability (Johansen et al.,
2011; Sigurdsson et al., 2007), PV-IN plasticity was localized to
presynaptic compartments. Similar to our findings, a recent
study reported that intercalated GABAergic projection neurons
that surround the basolateral amygdala display decreased gluta-
matergic responses following fear conditioning (Asede et al.,
2015). To our knowledge, however, ours is the first study to
describe plasticity of GABA release following associative
learning. Since target-selective structural plasticity has been
observed in PV-INs after extinction training (Trouche et al.,
2013), it seems that dynamic regulation of PV-IN terminals could
be a fundamental mechanism of emotional learning. However,
we did not observe reversal of decreased GABA release onto
principal neurons after extinction learning (Figure S7), indicating
different modes of experience-dependent plasticity may govern
the role of amygdala PV-INs in fear conditioning and extinction.
The mechanisms mediating decreased transmission from
PV-INs after fear learning are currently unknown. Upregulation
of both parvalbumin and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67
(GAD67, a GABA synthetic enzyme) in PV-INs has been pro-
posed to be a signature of memory encoding across multiple
paradigms and brain regions, including in the hippocampus after
contextual fear conditioning (Donato et al., 2013). These
changes would be predicted to decrease PPR of oIPSCs due
to increased GABA stores as well as enhanced calcium buffering
capacity of PV-INs (Caillard et al., 2000). However, our data
show that these findings may not extrapolate to the amygdala,
where fear conditioning leads to a decrease in PPR of PV-IN-
mediated oIPSCs.
On the other hand, recently described effects of neuromodu-
lators on PV-IN release properties suggest their potential
involvement in fear-related inhibitory plasticity. Dopaminergic
terminals form dense perisomatic synapses onto amygdala
PV-INs (Brinley-Reed and McDonald, 1999; Pinard et al.,
2008), and ex vivo dopamine application acts through D2 recep-
tors to reduce GABA release from PV-INs (Chu et al., 2012).
Similar to fear conditioning (Figure 6), dopamine effects are man-
ifested at PV-IN synapses onto principal cells but not interneu-
rons. In addition, D2 receptor activation reduces the frequency
of sIPSCs as well as the magnitude of principal neuron feedfor-
ward inhibition in LA (Bissie
` re et al., 2003). Thus, dopamine
release may be a key mechanism leading to PV-IN plasticity
and corresponding amygdala disinhibition.
An intriguing outcome of our optogenetic interrogations was
that MGN terminals did not exhibit changes in glutamate release
onto PV-INs following fear conditioning (Figure 5), as predicted
based on electrical stimulation of the internal capsule (Figures
4A–4C), in which MGN axons could be detected based on
eYFP fluorescence. It seems unlikely that thalamic expression
of ChR2 prevented or occluded plasticity, since changes in
PPR were readily observed at TeA synapses. Therefore, we sug-
gest that internal capsule stimulation recruits other subcortical
projections whose modification may be important for auditory
fear conditioning. Future experiments should examine whether
these projections also account for previously described plas-
ticity of internal capsule EPSCs in principal neurons (Clem and
Huganir, 2010, 2013; McKernan and Shinnick-Gallagher, 1997;
Namburi et al., 2015; Rumpel et al., 2005; Tye et al., 2008;
Zhou et al., 2009), a finding that would upend the conventional
wisdom that excitatory synaptic strengthening is attributable to
the auditory thalamic pathway. It is worth noting, however, that
even though MGN synapses were unaffected by training, feed-
forward inhibition from this pathway could nevertheless be
modulated by decreased output of PV-INs (Figure 6).
Another important unanswered question is which neuronal
population(s) are responsible for enhanced inhibition onto PV-
INs in BA after fear learning (Figure 3L). While PV-INs are densely
interconnected in this region (Muller et al., 2005; Woodruff and
Sah, 2007), GABA release at PV-IN/PV-IN synapses was not
modulated by fear encoding (Figure 6), indicating that another
GABAergic population is responsible for this effect. Although re-
cordings from sensory cortex point to somatostatin-containing in-
terneurons as major regulators of PV-INs (Pfeffer et al., 2013; Xu
et al., 2013), only a very small percentage of somatostatin-positive
terminals form synapses with PV-INs in amygdala (Muller et al.,
2007). However, the GABAergic cells that mediate inhibitory plas-
ticity are not necessarily intrinsic to the amygdala and may be
connected to PV-INs through long-range projections, such as
those arising from the basal forebrain that densely and selectively
terminate onto PV-INs in the BA but not LA (McDonald et al.,
2011). Future studies will be required examine the contributions
of intrinsic and extrinsic GABAergic populations to experience-
dependent plasticity in amygdala PV-IN microcircuits.

 Regarding the outcomes of real-life traumatic experiences, the
various forms of PV-IN-specific plasticity that we describe could
contribute to amygdala hyperexcitability as well as generaliza-
tion of conditioned fear to nonspecific stimuli, which in certain
cases may serve an evolutionarily adaptive purpose. However,
such plasticity may also be a precipitating factor for escalating
fear and anxiety in PTSD. Indeed, preclinical animal models sug-
gest that PV-IN dysfunction may be involved in pathological,
extinction-resistant fear (Bissonette et al., 2014; Brown et al.,
2015; Lucas et al., 2014). Therefore, experiments should
examine whether chronic stress or trauma is associated with
altered inhibitory plasticity and whether these effects may under-
lie progression to emotional dysfunction. Our results provide an
initial framework for elucidating these roles by clarifying the basic
function of PV-IN microcircuits and their modification by aversive
conditioning.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Further details can be found in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Animals
All experiments were approved in advance by the Institutional Care and
Use Committee of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Experi-
ments were conducted on male mice 28–40 days of age from the
following lines: C56Bl/6J (RRID: IMSR_JAX:000664), PV-IRES-Cre (RRID:
IMSR_JAX:008069), R26-STOP-eYFP (RRID: IMSR_JAX:006148), and Rosa-
CAG-LSL-tdTomato-WPRE (Ai9; RRID: IMSR_JAX:007909).
Viral Targeting for Electrophysiology
Viral constructs were purchased from the University of Pennsylvania Vector
Core and included AAV1-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE (Addgene
#20298), AAV1-CBA-Flex-Arch-GFP (Addgene #22222), and AAV1-CamKIIa-
hChR2(H134R)-eYFP-WPRE (Addgene #26969P). Viral constructs (0.3–1 ml)
were bilaterally injected into the basolateral amygdala (AP �1.4, ML ± 3.3,
DV �5.0), temporal association cortex (AP �4.0, ML ± 4.0, DV �3.5), and
medial geniculate nucleus (AP �3.2, ML ± 1.8, DV �3.5).
Viral Targeting for Monosynaptic Circuit Tracing
Viral constructs were purchased from the University of North Carolina Vector
Core (AAV8-EF1a-FLEX-TVA-mCherry, Addgene #38044; AAV8-CA-FLEX-
RG, Addgene #38043; Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012) and the Salk Institute
Gene Transfer, Targeting, and Therapeutics Core (EnvA G-deleted Rabies-
eGFP, Addgene #32635; Wickersham et al., 2007). Unilateral basolateral
amygdala injections of AAV8-EF1a-FLEX-TVA-mCherry and AAV8-CA-FLEX-
RG (1:1 ratio) were conducted 3 weeks prior to EnvA G-deleted Rabies-
eGFP, and animals were sacrificed by transcardial perfusion 1 week later.
Immunofluorescence Staining
Immunofluoresence was conducted as previously described (Lucas et al.,
2014).
Fear Conditioning
Cued auditory fear conditioning was conducted in sound attenuating cham-
bers with automated stimulus delivery software (MedAssociates) as previously
described (Clem and Huganir, 2010, 2013).
Slice Electrophysiology
Acute coronal slices of the basolateral amygdala were prepared as previously
described (Clem and Huganir, 2010, 2013). Cells were visualized on an upright
DIC microscope equipped with objective-coupled LEDs (460 nm and broad
spectrum [white]; Prizmatix, Givat-Shmuel, Israel) for the identification of fluo-
rescence-labeled cells as well as optogenetic cellular manipulations. Data
were low-pass filtered at 3 kHz (evoked) and 10 kHz (spontaneous, miniature)
and acquired at 10 kHz using Multiclamp 700B and pClamp 10 (Molecular De-
vices). Evoked data were analyzed in Clampfit 10 (Molecular Devices); sponta-
neous and miniature currents were analyzed with MiniAnalysis (Synaptosoft).
All data analyses were conducted blind to the experimental group.
Morphological Analysis
Live brain sections were prepared as for slice electrophysiology. PV-INs were
identified by tdTomato expression, patched, and filled with 0.5% biocytin. Tis-
sue preparation and morphological analyses were conducted as previously
described (Dougherty et al., 2014).
Statistics
Two-tail paired t tests (one group), two-tail independent samples t tests (two
groups), one-way ANOVA (R3 groups), two-way ANOVA (R2 groups with R
2 variables), or two-way repeated-measures ANOVA (R2 groups with
repeating variable) were implemented to determine statistical significance.
All post hoc tests were chosen to maintain family wise error rate at 0.05.
Data are presented as mean ± SEM with n as the number of cells followed
by the number of animals in parentheses.
