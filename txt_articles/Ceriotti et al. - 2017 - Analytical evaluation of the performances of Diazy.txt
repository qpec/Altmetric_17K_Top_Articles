Abstract
Background: Procalcitonin (PCT) is a recognized marker of 
sepsis, and its use is expanding to antibiotic stewardship. 
The aim of this study was the evaluation of two methods: 
Diazyme PCT on Roche Cobas c702 (PCT-D) and BRAHMS 
PCT on Roche Cobas e602 analyzers (PCT-BR) in compari-
son with BRAHMS PCT-sensitive Kryptor (PCT-BK).
Methods: Imprecision was assessed at six critical con-
centrations following the CLSI EP5-A3; limits of detection 
(LoDs) were checked according to CLSI EP17-A2; linearity 
was tested, and method comparison was performed on 
239 serum samples.
Results: Overall CVs ranged from 12.58% to 5.97% for 
PCT-D, from 3.94% to 1.70% for PCT-BR and from 6.57% 
to 1.90% for PCT-BK. LoDs were 0.143 μg/L, 0.014 μg/L, 
0.040 μg/L for PCT-D, PCT-BR and PCT-BK, respec-
tively. The functional assay sensitivity was 0.24 μg/L 
for PCT-D, 0.045 μg/L for PCT-BK and <0.035 μg/L for 
PCT-BR. PCT-BR was linear up to 68.7 μg/L, PCT-BK up to 
43 μg/L and PCT-D up to 27
.2 μg/L. Method comparison: 
PCT-D = 0.6543 PCT-BK + 0.014, r = 0.8463 (but 0.44 if calcu-
lated on 0–5 μg/L range); PCT-BR = 0.9125 PCT-BK + 0.021, 
r = 0.9917
. Cohen’s κ ranged from 45.2% at 0.25 μg/L to 
57
.0% at 2.00 μg/L between PCT-D and PCT-BK, whereas 
it ranged from 89% to 81.3% between PCT-BR and PCT-BK.
Conclusions: The PCT-D performances were significantly 
different from those of PCT-BR and PCT-BK regarding 
sensitivity, precision, linearity and agreement at clinical 
cutoffs. For some patients with serial testing, significantly 
deviating results were obtained compared to reference. In 
contrast to Roche PCT assay, it does not seem feasible to 
use BRAHMS PCT cutoffs for the Diazyme test.

Introduction
Procalcitonin (PCT) is a soluble protein released into cir-
culation in response to significant systemic inflammation, 
mainly caused by bacterial origin [1]. It is a recognized marker 
of bacterial infection, in well-defined clinical subsets, and 
sepsis [2]. Elevated PCT concentrations have a high positive 
predictive value for the diagnosis of sepsis, severe sepsis or 
septic shock (PCT >0.5 to >2 μg/L). On the contrary, normal 
or very low PCT plasma concentrations have a high negative 
predictive value to rule out severe systemic inflammation or 
sepsis (PCT <0.25 to <0.5 μg/L) [1] and provide guidance to 
the physician to re-assess the suspected diagnosis.
Reference individuals without any bacterial infec-
tion usually have PCT levels <0.05 μg/L (97
.5th percentile) 
when measured with an ultrasensitive test [3], and found 
clearly below 0.1 μg/L when measured with any of the cur-
rently available sensitive PCT tests used in clinical routine. 
Various clinical cutoffs for PCT are established for various 
clinical settings, with higher cutoffs being used in critical 
care and sepsis and lower cutoffs being used in immuno-
compromised patients, or to guide antibiotic decisions [4]. 
PCT-based clinical algorithms have been proposed to guide 
antibiotic therapy both for patients with lower respiratory 
tract infections (LRTI), including pneumonia, acute exac-
erbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 
acute bronchitis as well as for critically ill patients [5–8]. 
The use of PCT in community acquired pneumonia has 
also been proposed both for adults [9] and children [10]. 
Both the use as a marker of bacterial infection, in well-
defined clinical subsets and sepsis and as antibiotic guid-
ance, rely on the above-mentioned decision limits.

Moreover, the use of PCT in different contexts 
increases the importance of the measurements in the low 
range. Further, it is important that PCT levels are not only 
interpreted strictly in the context of the clinical setting, 
but also considering the technical performance of the 
particular PCT assay used [4]. The latter is of relevance as 
the clinical cutoffs have been set up using the BRAHMS 
PCT-sensitive Kryptor assay, so to use the same limits with 
different methods requires a very good analytical perfor-
mance and comparability with the predicate method.
The scope of the work was to analyze the assay per-
formance of Diazyme PCT (application on COBAS system 
c702) (PCT-D) and Elecsys BRAHMS PCT (on COBAS e602) 
(PCT-BR) in comparison with BRAHMS PCT-sensitive 
Kryptor (PCT-BK).
Materials and methods
The Diazyme PCT (Diazyme Laboratories, Poway, CA, USA) was 
installed on the module c702 of a Roche Cobas 8000 (Roche Diag-
nostics) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The Elecsys 
BRAHMS PCT (Roche Diagnostics) was installed on the module e602 
of the same Roche analyzer, BRAHMS PCT-sensitive Kryptor (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific, BRAHMS GmbH) was measured on the Kryptor 
Compact Plus instrument.
Evaluation of imprecision
The experiment was performed according to the CLSI document 
EP05-A3: duplicate measurements in two runs per day over 20 days 
(80 measurements per sample) with the three methods under evalu-
ation [11]. Four serum pools were prepared from routine leftover sam-
ples at concentrations close to the decision limits and two control 
materials (CTR_PCTL1 and 2, lot 105150 [Diazyme] for PCT-D; CTR_ 
PCT1 lot 131981 and CTR_ PCT2 lot 131983 [Thermo Fisher] for PCT-BR; 
CTR_PCT 1 and 2 lot 25030 [Thermo Fisher] for PCT-BK).
Limit of detection (LoD) was defined according to the CLSI docu-
ment EP17-A2 [12]. Ten pools with PCT concentrations close to the LoD 
declared by the manufacturers were prepared from routine leftover 
samples. The same pools were used for PCT-BR and PCT-BK, whereas 
a different set of pools was used for PCT-D. Each pool was measured in 
duplicate in five different days. The CV obtained on the 10 pools were 
used to define a precision profile to calculate the functional sensitivity. 
A specific limit of blank (LoB) study was not performed, and the LoB 
magnitude was extrapolated from the SD obtained in the LoD study.
Linearity
A high concentration sample was diluted in a scalar mode with a low 
concentration pool. The 11 dilutions were measured in triplicate with 
the three methods. The plotted data were visually inspected, and a 
least square linear regression was performed using only the points 
in the linear part of the plot. Deviation from linearity was assessed 
according to CLSI EP6-A [13].
Method comparison
Two hundred and thirty-nine serum samples were selected from 
clinical laboratory routine in order to cover adequately the whole 
concentration range, with a sample distribution that reflects the 
average distribution of PCT measurements in clinical routine in our 
laboratory. Each sample was measured with the three methods on 
the same day, or at maximum 24 h apart. Between measurements, 
samples were stored capped at 2–8 °C. PCT-D and PCT-BR were meas-
ured on the same aliquot on the two modules (c702 and e602) of the 
same Roche Cobas 8000 analytical system. The measurements were 
performed during a period of 3 months (September–November 2016) 
using two different lots of reagents for each of the three methods.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses regarding the method comparisons were done 
with R version 3.1.2 [14], deploying packages “mcr” 1.2.1. [15], using 
the Passing-Bablok approach [16].
Ethical approval
The evaluation was performed on pre-existing inpatient serum sam-
ples referred for routine PCT testing, and the material was obtained 
after routine analysis was completed. Therefore, no institutional 
review board approval was necessary. The research complied with 
the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki regarding 
ethical conduct of research.
Results
Imprecision
The results of the three methods are shown in Table 1. 
The analysis of variance allows to separate the different 
sources of variability. The overall CV ranged from 12.58% 
to 5.97% for PCT-D, from 3.94% to 1.70% for PCT-BR and 
from 6.57% to 1.90% for PCT-BK.
Limits of detection
The calculated LoDs were 0.143 μg/L, 0.014 μg/L and 
0.040 μg/L for PCT-D, PCT-BR and PCT-BK, respectively. 
The functional sensitivity (concentration where CV = 20%) 
was 0.24 μg/L for PCT-D and 0.045 μg/L for PCT-BK,

whereas for PCT-BR, the CV obtained at 0.05 μg/L was 
only 7
.6% (Figure 1).
Linearity
All the three methods showed deviation from linearity at 
the low range (difference between the second-order [quad-
ratic] model and the first-order [linear] >20% at the lowest 
concentration tested). Only the PCT-BR was linear up to 
the highest concentration tested (68.7 μg/L) (r = 0.9987) 
(differences between second and first-order model always 
<5%). The PCT-BK provided linear results up to 43 μg/L 
(r = 0.9988). The last concentration where PCT-D showed 
a linear response was 19.5 μg/L (r = 0.9955). In a second 
experiment with a lower concentration sample, PCT-D 
showed linearity up to 27
.2 μg/L (r = 0.9977) (see Supple-
mental Figure 1 for details).
Method comparison
The patient samples were selected from routine within the 
linearity limit of the PCT-D method with a sample distri-
bution that reflects the average distribution of PCT meas-
urements in clinical routine. The results are presented 
in Figures 2 and 3. The regression equations  
according 
to  
Passing-Bablok are the following: PCT-D = 0.6543 
PCT-BK + 0.014; 
PCT-BR = 0.9125 
PCT-BK + 0.021. 
The 
Pearson correlation coefficients (r) were 0.85 and 0.99, 
respectively, whereas in the clinically most relevant range, 
that is for PCT-BK values smaller than 5 μg/L, the correla-
tion coefficients were PCT-D vs. PCT-BK = 0.44; PCT-BR vs. 
PCT-BK = 0.99.
The level of concordance of the three methods at the 
different clinical cutoffs is described in Table 2. At the 
clinical relevant cutoff of 0.25 μg/L, the concordance 
between the Kryptor and the Diazyme PCT assay was only 
78.2% (Cohen’s κ 45.2%), and at the cutoff 0.5 μg/L, the

concordance between the two methods was only 74.5% 
(Cohen’s κ 44.9%) (Table 2).
For some patients, serial PCT values were available. 
PCT-BK and PCT-BR in all cases demonstrated high cor-
relation over the entire time course while PCT-D for some 
samples presented a response completely different from 
PCT-BK/PCT-BR with values up to 10 times higher or more. 
This difference was reproducible and consistent over dif-
ferent samples from the same patient, and generally (but 
not always) in line with the septic state of the patient, an 
example is presented in Figure 4, patient A. Moreover, we 
documented five cases with very high PCT-D (in four cases 
>25 μg/L), with completely normal PCT-BK and/or PCT-BR

Discussion
Performance assessment
For the three methods, the observed level of imprecision is 
in line with the specifications of the manufacturers [17–19]. 
The imprecision is significantly lower for the BRAHMS PCT 
on both analyzers (Roche Cobas and BRAHMS Kryptor); 
this is expected for the different technical principles on 
which the methods are based. PCT-D is a latex enhanced 
immunoturbidimetric assay, whereas PCT-BR is an elec-
trochemiluminescent immunoassay and PCT-BK is a sand-
wich immunoassay using time-resolved amplified cryptate 
emission technology. It can be observed that for PCT-BR 
and PCT-BK, the between-day component of imprecision 
was negligible, whereas for the PCT-D, especially at lower 
concentrations, the between-day component was rele-
vant. The observed LoD and the functional sensitivity for 
PCT-D were much higher than those declared by Diazyme 
(0.051 and 0.15 μg/L) [19], but in line with those published 
by Dipalo et al. [20], whereas for PCT-BR and PCT-BK, the 
values were slightly better than those declared [17
, 18]. The 
reproducibility performances of PCT-BR at very low PCT 
concentrations are clearly superior to those of the other 
two systems (Figure 1). The results of the linearity experi-
ment for PCT-D were not in line with the manufacturer’s 
specifications neither with what obtained by Dipalo et al. 
[20]. Linearity was checked in two different experiments 
(same reagent lot) (see Supplemental Figure 1); moreover, 
the automatic dilution system of Roche for clinical chem-
istry assays (use of a reduced sample volume) was not 
successful (data not shown), so only manual dilutions 
with a negative serum were effective for samples with PCT 
concentration >25 μg/L. For PCT-BK the declared linear-
ity limit was reached (43 μg/L was the last dilution under 
the limit of 50 μg/L for direct measuring range while for 
PCT-BR a good linearity was obtained up to the highest 
concentration tested (68.7 μg/L) that however is below the 
manufacturer’s specifications (100 μg/L).
Method comparison
This part revealed unexpected results regarding PCT-D. 
It demonstrated a poor correlation to the reference 
(r = 0.44 when calculated on low concentration samples, 
up to 5 μg/L). The presence of a certain number of aber-
rant high results is evident in Figure 2A and even more 
when the data are presented as bias plot (Supplemental

Level of concordance evaluated at different clinical cutoffs. The clinical cutoff 0.1 μg/L was not considered for analysis because of the low 
sensitivity of the PCT-D which would not allow differentiation at this cutoff (PCT-D: LoD = 0.14 and FAS = 0.24 μg/L).

Figure 2A). The lack of correlation at low PCT concentra-
tion is evident in Figure 2B that represents the results in 
the zone 0–1 μg/L. The assessment of deviating results 
and method bias is reported in Table 3. As summarized 
in Table 2, there was a high number of false-negative and 
false-positive results with the PCT-D, particularly for the 
lower cutoffs. The significant bias of PCT-D to the refer-
ence together with relatively high imprecision of the 
PCT-D, particularly at lower range, contributes to the low 
Cohen’s κ-values reported in Table 2. To identify the dif-
ferent components that contribute to the poor correlation 
between PCT-D and PCT-BK, we plotted the % difference 
between the two methods vs. the PCT-BK values, focusing 
at the lower PCT concentration range (Figure 5).
It appears that a significant part of the differences 
at PCT concentrations <0.5 μg/L is explained by the high 
imprecision of the PCT-D, combined with the relevant 
calibration bias (−33.7%). However, almost 40% of the

 168      Ceriotti et al.: Evaluation of Diazyme and BRAHMS PCT
samples at concentration <0.5 μg/L seem to show sam-
ple-related interferences (differences up to 26,000%, 
the y axis of Figure 5 is truncated at 300%). The same 
elaboration for PCT-BR (Supplemental Figure 3) shows 
that most of the samples are within the ±20% acceptable 
total error [21], and only values <0.25 μg/L present higher 
% differences.
The obtained results are only partially in contrast 
with those reported by Dipalo et al. [20]. In fact, looking 
carefully at the correlation plot in the low range, the 
dispersion was high; moreover, the reported κ-values 
at 0.25 and 0.50 μg/L were even lower (0.14 and 0.24, 
respectively) [20]. The authors focused more at higher 
cutoff for judging the level of agreement. In fact, they 
suggested the use of a confirmatory method for Diazyme 
results <0.26 μg/L. However, if following this concept 
and taking into account the very low performance also 
at cutoff 0.5 μg/L, as confirmed in our study, probably 
many more samples would need to be retested as in our 
practice nearly two third of all samples in clinical routine 
have PCT <0.5 μg/L.
The PCT-D has the advantage of being applicable to 
the common clinical chemistry analytical systems, pro-
viding results in a short time with potentially lower cost, 
but the obtained low concordance to the reference, as 
reflected by the κ-values for all four tested cutoffs, should 
cause caution in its use. The significant number of false 
negatives (Table 2) limits the use of PCT-D as a test for dif-
ferential diagnosis or initiation of antibiotic therapy espe-
cially in patients with LRTI.
It is difficult to hypothesize the reasons for this dif-
ferent performance. Although the lower assay sensitivity 
in general can be attributed to the turbidimetric assay 
format, there seem to be also other aspects influencing 
the specific assay performance like calibration, blocking 
of interfering substances, etc., but potentially also the 
type of antibodies used, where, in contrast to the BRAHMS 
assay [22], no information is available for Diazyme.
This could also provide some explanation for the obser-
vation that PCT-D for some samples presented a response 
completely different from PCT-BK/PCT-BR. Further investi-
gation would be required to understand the reason for the 
differing behavior of the PCT-D vs. the PCT-BR and PCT-BK.
Different to the PCT-D, the comparison between 
PCT-BR and PCT-BK shows, as expected by previously 
published data [23], a very good correlation as appears 
from the Figure 3A and B and from the level of agreement 
indicated in Table 2. The small underestimation of PCT-BR 
(slope 0.912), very similar to the one reported by the man-
ufacturer [18], explains the <100% agreement between 
the two methods (see Tables 2 and 3). However, a high 
agreement of PCT-BR with PCT-BK was demonstrated for 
all analyzed cutoffs. Therefore, it can be concluded that 
PCT-BR can share the same cutoffs and clinical algorithms 
as established with PCT-BK. This is supported by the use 
of PCT-BR together with PCT-BK in a recently published 
randomized controlled interventional trial on PCT-guided 
antibiotics stewardship in critically ill patients using a 
clinical algorithm for discontinuation of antibiotics based 
of >80% decline of PCT and/or PCT <0.5 μg/L together with 
clinical improvement [7]. The extremely good precision of 
PCT-BR at low PCT concentration makes the method well 
suited for differential diagnosis and PCT-based guidance 
of antibiotic therapy both for patients with LRTI or high 
risk patients with suspected or confirmed systemic bacte-
rial infection/sepsis [7–11].

PCT-BK values.
The gray area indicates the acceptable total error. The red dotted 
lines delimitate the expected dispersion due only to the combined 
imprecision of the two methods (zero bias, two times the combined 
SD). The blue lines delimitate the expected dispersion considering 
combined imprecision and calibration bias (−33.7%).
