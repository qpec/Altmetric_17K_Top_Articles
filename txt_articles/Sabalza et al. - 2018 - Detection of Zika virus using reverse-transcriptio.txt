Abstract
In recent years, there have been increasing numbers of infectious disease outbreaks that
spread rapidly to population centers resulting from global travel, population vulnerabilities,
environmental factors, and ecological disasters such as floods and earthquakes. Some
examples of the recent outbreaks are the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, Middle East respi-
ratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-Co) in the Middle East, and the Zika outbreak through
the Americas. We have created a generic protocol for detection of pathogen RNA and/or
DNA using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and reverse dot-blot for detec-
tion (RDB) and processed automatically in a microfluidic device. In particular, we describe
how a microfluidic assay to detect HIV viral RNA was converted to detect Zika virus (ZIKV)
RNA. We first optimized the RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV RNA using a benchtop isother-
mal amplification device. Then we implemented the assay in a microfluidic device that will
allow analyzing 24 samples simultaneously and automatically from sample introduction
to detection by RDB technique. Preliminary data using saliva samples spiked with ZIKV
showed that our diagnostic system detects ZIKV RNA in saliva. These results will be vali-
dated in further experiments with well-characterized ZIKV human specimens of saliva. The
described strategy and methodology to convert the HIV diagnostic assay and platform to a
ZIKV RNA detection assay provides a model that can be readily utilized for detection of the
next emerging or re-emerging infectious disease.
Introduction
Multiple outbreaks of infectious diseases, including yellow fever, severe acute respiratory syn-
drome (SARS), Ebola, dengue, chikungunya, are occurring with increasing frequency. At least
three major factors have influenced the increasing incidence of infectious disease epidemics:
population concentration at the epicenter of an infection, the underlying characteristics and
vulnerabilities of the population at the epicenter [1] and extensive air travel to spread the

 disease globally [2–5]. The most recent is Zika virus (ZIKV), which is an emerging arbovirus
in the genus Flavivirus and family of Flaviviridae, related to yellow fever, dengue, West Nile,
Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. Zika virus is transmitted among
humans primarily by mosquito vectors (Aedes spp., including Ae. aegypti and Ae. Albopictus)
[6–8] and humans serve as the primary amplification hosts in areas where there are no non-
human primates [9]. ZIKV was first identified in Uganda in 1947, and since then outbreaks
have been recorded in Africa, Southeast Asia, Pacific with the last one in Brazil in early 2015,
which spread to other countries in Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the South-
ern United States [10–12]. In all these areas autochthonous and travel associated infection has
been reported [6–8, 13].
Early pathogen identification is necessary to combat the spread of these newly emerging
and re-emerging epidemics [14, 15]. Diagnosis can be accomplished with a generic platform
and protocol designed to identify any pathogen by detection of the pathogen’s nucleic acid
once its sequence is determined and its antigenic footprint identified. The same platform can
be utilized to detect any emerging or reemerging pathogen by modifying the primers and
probes to detect specific target nucleic acid sequences and once identified, antigenic epitopes
that can be utilized to detect pathogen specific antibodies.
In this study we have adapted a portable microfluidic device that we developed for HIV
RNA detection to detect ZIKV RNA in saliva samples. We previously reported the ability to
utilize a single sample of blood and/or saliva to simultaneously detect both HIV antibodies and
HIV RNA using a microfluidic device for Point-of-Care (POC) testing [16]. We optimized a
commercially available serological assay to run within the microfluidic device while we incor-
porated the reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay
to detect the presence of HIV RNA.
LAMP was first reported by Notomi et al. 2000 [17] (Eiken Chemical Co.) and has rapidly
gained popularity for POC testing [18, 19]. This is in part due to the relative simplicity of
building an isothermal device, but also due to the strand displacement quality of the polymer-
ase so there is no need to denature double stranded DNA prior to amplification. LAMP uses
two separate sets of primer pairs that specifically recognize 6 distinct target regions. Addition
of a third pair of primers (forward and reverse loop primers) increases the sensitivity and
decreases the time required for results [20]. RNA can also be targeted with the addition of
reverse transcriptase.
Saliva is a good choice for diagnostics due to the noninvasive ease of collection, cost effec-
tiveness, and high acceptance by subjects/patients [21]. Saliva has been used for the diagnosis
of salivary gland tumors [22], tongue squamous cell carcinoma [23], measurement of cortisol
levels [24], viruses [25], RNA [26], and drugs of abuse [27].
In this study we first optimized the RT-LAMP assay to detect ZIKV RNA using a benchtop
isothermal amplification device and then adapted the assay to the microfluidic device, Rheonix
CARD1 cartridge. We have demonstrated that a fully integrated RT-LAMP assay coupled to
reverse dot-blot (RDB) technique and processed by the Encompass Optimum workstation [28]
can detect ZIKV RNA spiked in saliva samples. Having established a proof-of-concept of our
methodology future experiments will be focused on validating it with human clinical samples.

Zika viral production and titration
ZIKV strain PRVABC59, NR-50240 was obtained through Biodefense and Emerging Infec-
tions Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources), NIAID, NIH and propagated in Vero
cells. ZIKV stock was obtained from infected cells supernatant.
Vero E6 cells (ATCC1 CRL-1586TM) were maintained in tissue culture flasks at 37˚C in
an atmosphere containing 5% CO2 with Eagle’s minimum essential medium containing Earle’s
balanced salt solution, non-essential amino acids, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium pyru-
vate, 100 units Penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml Streptomycin, 1.25% Amphotericin, supplemented with
2% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, S11150H).
Vero cells were infected when at 70% to 80% confluence at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 0.01. After 1 h virus adsorption at 37˚C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, fresh
medium was added and cells incubated for up to 3 days. The supernatant was then collected,
centrifuged at 2000 x g for 5 min to remove cell debris, and the supernatant stored at -80˚C.
Viral titration was determined by plaque assay in Vero cells with a 0.4% ultrapure low melt
point agarose (Invitrogen, 16520–050) overlay. After 5 days of incubation at 37˚C in an atmo-
sphere containing 5% CO2, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde, washed, and stained with
0.025% (wt/vol) crystal violet in 2% (vol/vol) ethanol for visualization of plaques (2.9 x 106 pla-
que-forming units/ml). Genomic purified ZIKV RNA (PRVABC59, Puerto Rican strain, NR-
50244) obtained from BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH (Manassas, VA) with a known viral RNA
copy number was serially diluted ten-fold and used as a standard to generate a standard con-
centration curve graphing the RNA concentration (RNA copies/ml) vs amplification time in
the RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III device. This allowed estimating the copy number of the
ZIKV stock (2.2 x 107 RNA copies /ml).
Purified genomic RNA from ZIKV
Purified genomic RNA from ZIKV, strain PLCal_ZV (Thailand) (70 ng/μl, 1.6 x 1013 RNA
copies/ml), was donated by Dr. James Whitney, Center for Virology and Vaccine Research,
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School. Additional purified genomic
RNA from four different ZIKV strains (Asian lineage) were obtained through BEI Resources,
(Manassas, VA): PRVABC59, Puerto Rican strain, NR-50244 (2.0 x 107 RNA copies/ml);
PLCal_ZV, Thailand strain, NR-50242 (5.1 x 107 RNA copies/ml); FLR, Florida strain, NR-
5024 (4.4 x 107 RNA copies/ml) and R103451, Honduras strain, NR-50358 (5.4 x 107 RNA cop-
ies/ml). The BEI Resources (Manassas, VA) supplied the copy numbers of viral RNA per ml
(RNA copies/ml), determined using Droplet Digital RT-PCR.
Purified genomic RNA from Dengue Virus (DENGV) serotype 1 (Hawaii, NR-4287) and
serotype 2 (New Guinea C, NR-4288) were also obtained through BEI Resources (Manassas,
VA).
LAMP primers
Primers targeting a unique conserved sequence in the ZIKV capsid were designed using the
Primer Explorer V4 software (Eiken Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan) with conserved regions of
the capsid gene of the PLCal_ZV, Thailand strain (GeneBank accession no. KF993678.1). A set
of 3 primer pairs (Table 1), including two outer primers (forward primer F3 and backward
primer B3), two inner primers (forward inner primer FIP and backward inner primer BIP),
and two loop primers (forward loop primer LF and backward loop primer LB), were selected.

 All primers were assessed for specificity before use in LAMP assays by analysis using the Basic
Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) against sequences in GenBank indicating that they are ZIKV specific. The ZIKV prim-
ers were also tested in duplicate for cross-reactivity against Dengue virus (DENV) RNA, sero-
type 1 and 2. DENV RNA from both serotypes did not amplify with ZIKV primers, showing
specificity of the ZIKV primers (S1 and S2 Figs). Sequence of the Dengue primers for each
serotype used were described in Lau et al. 2015 [29].
RT-LAMP assay
RT-LAMP reaction was carried out in a final volume of 25 μl including the OptiGene Master
mix ISO-004 with 7.5 units of WarmStart reverse transcriptase (New England BioLabs,
M0380L) and 3 pairs of primers targeting a unique conserved sequence in the ZIKV capsid
(Table 1). 3–7 μl RNA were added as a template. The RT-LAMP reaction was performed at
65˚C for 30 min. The temperature and primer concentrations were optimized in the lab.
Real-time RT-LAMP assay using the Genie III device.
Experiments using the Genie III
(OptiGene, Horsham, UK) portable isothermal amplification device were performed to opti-
mize the RT-LAMP assay. SYBR Green I interchelating dye is included in the OptiGene Mas-
ter mix (OptiGene ISO-004) which allows following real-time fluorescence in a Genie III.
RT-LAMP assay using the microfluidic Rheonix CARD1 cartridge.
The microfluidic
Rheonix CARD1 cartridge developed by Rheonix Inc. (Ithaca, NY) is an integrated cassette
that can provide both an immunological and nucleic acid (RT-LAMP) result from a single
sample. It incorporates all the pumps, valves, micro channels, reactions, and reagent reservoirs
on a disposable cartridge described in Chen et al. 2016 [16]. The processing and analysis on
the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge is controlled by the Encompass Optimum workstation devel-
oped to provide automated control of all sample preparation functions as described in Spizz
et al. 2012 [28]. Since the current Encompass Optimum workstation does not possess the abil-
ity to monitor fluorescence, we employed a novel reverse dot-blot (RDB) hybridization tech-
nique to monitor the specific ZIKV amplicons produced in the RT-LAMP assay using
hybridization to nucleic acid probes immobilized on integrated DNA arrays [30]. Coupled
with the workstation’s image analysis software, qualitative viral loads can be determined. In
this approach 50 μl of sample containing pre-heated lysed ZIKV was added to the sample res-
ervoir on the Rheonix CARD1 [16]. All other steps were automatically performed under soft-
ware control. The RT-LAMP reaction mix was dispensed automatically into the master mix
reservoir onto the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge [16] and pumped with 7 μl of the spiked sample
to the amplification tube where the RT-LAMP reaction was carried out at 65˚C for 30 min.
ZIKV RNA was amplified using biotinylated primers. The RDB method employs the same
primers used for the RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III (Table 1) but the FIP primer is

 biotinylated. After amplification, the denatured amplicons are hybridized to membrane bound
ZIKV capture probes and detected by subsequent addition of streptavidin-conjugated HRP
and substrate. Initially four DNA oligo probes were designed to target the ZIKV amplicon
from the RT-LAMP reaction (Table 2). These four DNA probes were synthesized and immobi-
lized on an activated membrane as a DNA array [28, 30] at three different concentrations (20,
2 and 0.2 μM). The microarray key is provided as supporting information (S1 Table). Pre-
heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS (phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4) was used as a tem-
plate for RDB assay optimization on the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge.
In subsequent experiments, Probe 4 was immobilized on an activated membrane as a DNA
array [28, 30] at different concentrations from 20 μM to 0.039 μM by two-fold dilutions. The
microarray key is provided as supporting information (S2 Table). Pre-heated lysed ZIKV
diluted in 1XPBS was used as a template for optimization of the RDB assay to semi-quantita-
tive estimate the viral load. Pre-heated lysed ZIKV spiked in saliva was used as a template in
the fully integrated LAMP assay plus RDB detection on the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge.
Devices used for RT-LAMP assays
Depending on the device used for the RT-LAMP assay, different detection techniques were
applied (Table 3).
Spiking saliva samples
Uninfected human saliva samples were spiked with ZIKV to test the feasibility of using a
RT-LAMP assay with saliva samples. Ten-fold serial dilutions of the virus in 1XPBS were pre-
pared. Saliva was first diluted 1:5 and 10 μl of each ten-fold serial dilution of the virus was
spiked into saliva and then heated at 90˚C for 5 min to inactivate and lyse the virus. Inactiva-
tion of ZIKV under these conditions was confirmed with plaque assays using Vero cells as
described above (S1 Table and S3 Fig). For experiments performed on the Rheonix CARD1
cartridge the uninfected human saliva was spiked as above but with pre-heated inactivated
ZIKV. This safety measure was required because the facilities at Rheonix Inc. (Ithaca, NY) lab-
oratory are not at a BSL-2 level.

 Results
ZIKV RNA RT-LAMP assay limit of detection on the Genie III device
Using the Genie III device we first demonstrated that a RT-LAMP assay could be used for the
detection of ZIKV RNA by testing serial ten-fold dilutions in 1XPBS of purified ZIKV genomic
RNA (strain PLCal_ZV (Thailand) donated by Dr. Whitney) (Fig 1A). Results showed that the
amplification time values, also known as Tp (time to positivity), of the RT-LAMP for ten-fold
serial dilutions of ZIKV RNA detection were between 3 and 10 min (Fig 1A) and a linear rela-
tionship between ZIKV RNA concentration and signal intensity was observed. The linear rela-
tionship of the RT-LAMP assay can be seen by the relationship between the log viral RNA
copies per ml against the Tp values (Fig 1B).
We also demonstrated that the RT-LAMP assay using primers targeting the ZIKV capsid
gene could detect multiple ZIKV Asian-lineages strains. For these experiments all the strains
concentrations were adjusted to 2 x 106 RNA copies/ml. We determined the limit of detection
of the RT-LAMP assay using ten-fold serial dilutions of purified genomic RNA from 4 differ-
ent ZIKV strains of the Asian-lineage (obtained from BEI, NIAID, NIH). The results indicate
that the RT-LAMP assay using primers that target the capsid consistently detected down to 2 x
103 (6 RNA copies/reaction) (Table 4).
ZIKV RNA is detectable in saliva
Uninfected human saliva was spiked with ZIKV at different concentrations corresponding to
ten-fold serial dilutions. RT-LAMP assay was performed on the Genie III device. Consistently,
the RT-LAMP assay detected 2.2 x 103 RNA copies/ml (6.6 RNA copies/reaction) in 100% of
the samples and in 75% of the samples 2.2 x 102 RNA copies/ml (0.66 RNA copies//reaction)
(Table 5). Ten replicates per dilution were tested.
Microfluidic Rheonix CARD1 cartridge adapted to detect ZIKV RNA
Pre-heated lysed ZIKV diluted in 1XPBS as template at 2 different concentrations (1.32 x 108
and 2.52 x 108 RNA copies/ml) was used to optimize the experiments on the Rheonix CARD1
cartridge. The RT-LAMP assay with biotinylated labeled primers was automatically carried
out in the amplification tube in the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge. Representative results show
(Fig 2) that the RT-LAMP amplicons can be detected using the RDB technique in the Rheonix
CARD1 cartridge. These results also showed that Probes 1 and 2 hybridized with the primers
for the RT-LAMP reaction and thus were not specific. However, Probes 3 and 4 are specific for
ZIKV amplicon (Fig 2) with Probe 4 (highlighted in yellow) generating the strongest signal.
The microarray key is provided as supporting information (S2 Table).
Probe 4 was selected for further RDB experiments. A serial dilution of Probe 4, which binds
specifically to ZIKV amplicons, demonstrates that it is possible to semi-quantitatively deter-
mine the viral load based on the image density of the hybridized spot (Fig 3). Probe 2, which
binds to the primer pairs was also included on the array to confirm that the reaction mix con-
taining the ZIKV primer pairs and amplicon was successfully pumped from the Rheonix
CARD1 cartridge’s reservoirs to the DNA array.
To further demonstrate the ability to obtain a semi-quantitative estimation of the viral load,
we evaluated the relative signal intensity of a range of ZIKV RT-LAMP amplicons (~199 ng to
3200 ng) as a function of increasing concentration of the biotinylated Probe 4 (Fig 4) and an
excellent dose response curve was achieved. An increase of sensitivity was observed with high
concentrations of amplicon and Probe 4. Depending on the amplicon concentration generated
by LAMP, the response reaches maximum intensity as a function of immobilized Probe 4

 concentration. Future experiments will focus on evaluating Probe 4 concentration to obtain a lin-
ear dose response allowing a more accurate estimation of the viral load of the sample analyzed.
In order to determine the ability to perform a fully integrated LAMP assay including RDB
detection on the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge, we performed an assay using pre-heated lysed

Discussion
The recent ZIKV outbreak is an example of the course of emerging infectious diseases. ZIKV
infection had been considered to only be a modest public health concern with only local out-
breaks [31, 32]. However reports from the recent outbreak in Brazil and the Americas during
2015–2016, indicated that infections during pregnancy are associated with microcephaly and
other neurological disorders in newborns and Guillain-Barre
´ Syndrome (GBS) in adults point-
ing to potentially more serious health impacts [33, 34]. On 1 February 2016, the World Health
organization (WHO) declared ZIKV and its link to birth defects a public health emergency of

 because it shares vectors, geographic distribution and symptoms with Dengue virus and Chi-
kungunya infection [36] and the three illnesses are often misdiagnosed. Given the risk for
adverse pregnancy outcomes in women infected with ZIKV during pregnancy, it is particularly
important to distinguish between the 3 viruses. This recent ZIKV outbreak confirm that we

 need an effective surveillance and diagnostic program to reduce the impact of future emerging
infectious diseases. Towards the goal of increasing the speed of making effective diagnostics
available, we have developed a generic protocol that can be adapted for the next emerging or
remerging disease.
Although PCR is a sensitive assay used for diagnostics, PCR requires trained personnel,
dedicated equipment and extended time (hours) for results. Isothermal amplification methods
have increasingly attracted attention due to their simplicity and sensitivity including nucleic
acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification
(LAMP), helicase-dependent amplification (HDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), multi-
ple displacement amplification (MDA) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) [37–
40] Among commercially available isothermal systems, LAMP stands out for its rapidity, sensi-
tivity and ability to amplify both DNA and RNA [17]. This is why we chose the LAMP assay to
detect HIV viral RNA in the HIV diagnostic dual assay that we developed [16]. Then we suc-
cessfully adapted it to detect DNA from P. falciparum and P. vivax by simply changing the
primers and optimizing the LAMP assay [41].
Salivary testing for diagnosis has advantages over other bodily fluids [21, 42] but in particu-
lar in ZIKV diagnosis it is beneficial because ZIKV RNA can only be detected in the blood
from 1–7 days after the clinical onset during acute infection, but persists longer in saliva,
semen and urine [43–45] suggesting that saliva could be a preferred specimen to use for ZIKV
diagnostics. Drawbacks to saliva as a test matrix are that the concentration is frequently lower
than typically found in serum and circadian variations in analyte concentrations can make
the sensitivity lower [46]. However recent development of microfluidic concentrators suitable
for diagnostics makes the analysis of nucleic acid targets that are present in low levels [47]
possible.
We first optimized the RT-LAMP assay using ZIKV purified genomic RNA as a template
on the Genie III device. We focused on the Asian-lineage ZIKV strains because they were
responsible for the recent epidemics in Latin America. There is a significant variation in
sequence between the African and Asian-lineages [48, 49]. Therefore other primers will have
to be designed to specifically detect the African lineage. We also determined the limit of detec-
tion of the assay with a dilution series of purified genomic ZIKV RNA from multiple strains of
the Asian-lineage. ZIKV RNA levels of 2 x 103 RNA copies/ml (6 RNA copies/reaction) were
consistently detected in the four strains. The limit of detection of the RT-LAMP assay using
spiked saliva samples was also found to be ~2 x 103 RNA copies/ml (6.6 RNA copies/reaction).
There have been reports showing that ZIKV can be detected by RT-LAMP assay without
the need for RNA purification [50, 51]. Our experiments also demonstrated that heat-lysis of
ZIKV is sufficient and subsequent isolation and purification of viral RNA is not required. In
spiking experiments, saliva samples were diluted 1:5 before isothermal amplification in order
to avoid the influence of matrix during real-time fluorescence detection. The heat-lyse treat-
ment protocol is easier, faster and requires less sample volume for the LAMP assay than isola-
tion and purification, which increases the compatible with POC applications.
After showing that the RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III could detect purified genomic
RNA as well as ZIKV spiked in saliva samples, we adapted it to the microfluidic Rheonix
CARD1 cartridge and processed it by the Encompass Optimum workstation. This approach
successfully detects ZIKV RNA using the RDB technology on the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge
and coupling this with the workstation’s image analysis and software capability provides a
semi-quantitative titer of viral load based on the image density of the hybridized spot. Estimat-
ing the viral load can be useful to investigate correlations of viral load with disease severity
and immune responses. This would be of particular importance for monitoring fetal infections
in pregnant women [52, 53]. We demonstrated the ability to perform a fully integrated

 RT-LAMP assay including RDB detection on the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge using ZIKV
spiked in saliva down to 8.57 x 102 RNA copies/ml (6 RNA copies/reaction). The same limit of
detection was obtained for the RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III with saliva samples spiked
with ZIKV. Ongoing experiments are focused on optimizing the conditions for amplification
of ZIKV RNA directly by heat-lysing the virus in the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge and without
purification of ZIKV RNA. Eventually the entire assay will be validated on Rheonix CARD1
cartridges using well-characterized ZIKV human specimens as well as samples from people
infected with other flaviviruses to confirm the reactivity and specificity of the assay.
The limit of detection of our RT-LAMP assay on the Genie III and Rheonix CARD1 car-
tridges is similar to other results reported using RT-LAMP and other isothermal assays [54].
These are promising results for the RT-LAMP assay coupled with RDB detection assay devel-
oped for the Rheonix CARD1 cartridge. However these results need to be validated using
ZIKV samples from well-characterized human specimens.
In the HIV dual diagnostic assay that we previously developed, the Rheonix CARD1 car-
tridge was processed in the prototype Encompass MDx SOLO workstation providing viral
RNA isolation and detection via RT-LAMP as well as antibody detection [16]. The compact
and portable real-time Encompass MDx SOLO workstation can process a single Rheonix
CARD1 cartridge, allowing a total of 4 samples to be simultaneously processed with real-time
fluorescence monitoring. We moved to the larger Encompass Optimum Workstation because
it allows 1 to 6 Rheonix CARD1 cartridges (24 samples) to be processed simultaneously. Since
the Encompass Optimum workstation does not employ fluorescence excitation and detection
system, the RDB technique was employed to interpret the molecular results by use of hybrid-
ization to nucleic acid probes immobilized on integrated DNA arrays. A major advantage of
the Encompass Optimum workstation over the Encompass MDx SOLO workstation is that
the Optimum workstation automatically introduces all samples and reagents to the Rheonix
CARD1 cartridge, which reduces the complexity of the final assay for the end user. In addition
user friendly and intuitive software is included in the workstation guiding the user. A touchsc-
reen initiates the totally automated process and finally interprets and reports the assay results.
In ZIKV infections, the virus persists in plasma or serum for only a relatively short period
of time while ZIKV can be detected for extended periods in other bodily fluids such as saliva,
urine or semen [55, 56]. This supports the goal to combine serological assays and RNA assays
to provide clinically relevant information across a longer time frame, which is particularly use-
ful in treating pregnant women.
The ZIKV serological assay is challenging because ZIKV antigens cross-react with other
flavivirus amino acid sequences [57]. We are working on the identification of ZIKV specific
antigens using a high-density peptide microarray (PEPperCHIP Platform Technology, Heidel-
berg, Germany) whereby 15-mer amino acids, overlapping by 14 amino acids are probed with
antibodies of interest in order to identify immunogenic epitopes [58]. Once validated the iden-
tified diagnostic peptides will be adapted to a serological assay incorporated on the Rheonix
CARD1 cartridge using a modification of the approach we used for antibody detection against
HIV [16]. Then we will able to simultaneously detect anti-ZIKV antibodies and RNA using the
Rheonix CARD1 cartridges.
There are only a few studies that have reported ZIKV detection in saliva using RT- LAMP
[51, 59, 60]. The novelty of our developed platform is the use of saliva as the sample matrix and
the RDB detection system coupled to the RT-LAMP assay performed in the Rheonix CARD1
cartridges. In addition, once diagnostic peptides are validated and incorporated into the Rheo-
nix CARD1 cartridges, we will be able to simultaneously detect ZIKV antibodies and ZIKV
RNA. There is currently no combined antibody/nucleic acid test available commercially for
ZIKV detection [61, 62].

 Adaption of this protocol for the next emerging infection requires two steps: (1) identifica-
tion of the nucleic acid sequence of the infectious agent, which allows synthesis of LAMP
primers and associated RDB probes and (2) discovery of diagnostic peptides that detect host
immune response(s) for a protein microarray. Our results provide the proof-of-principle of a
protocol for adapting an existing LAMP assay on a microfluidic device to detect HIV RNA, to
an assay to detect ZIKV RNA. Further experiments with clinical samples and diagnostic pep-
tides will validate the assay.
