Arriving rapidly to the hospital after a heart attack or stroke is critical for patients to be within
time windows for treatment. Prior research in heart attacks has suggested a paradoxical role
of the social environment: those who arrive early are surrounded by nonrelatives, while those
who arrive late are surrounded by spouses or family members. Here, we used network
methods to more deeply examine the influence of social context in stroke. We examined the
relationship of personal social networks and arrival time in 175 stroke patients. Our results
confirmed the paradox by showing that small and close-knit personal networks of highly
familiar contacts, independent of demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors, were
related to delay. The closed network structure led to constricted information flow in which
patients and close confidants, absent outside perspectives, elected to watch-and-wait. Tar-
geting patients with small, close-knit networks may be one strategy to improve response
times.

elay in arrival at the hospital is the most important reason
for not deploying treatment for heart attacks or strokes in
the world. More than 50% of the annual 1.2 million
people who suffer a heart attack death in the United States die in
the emergency department or before reaching a hospital within
an hour of symptoms1. Approximately, 70% of the 795,000 stroke
patients every year in the United States arrive after 6 h of
symptom onset2. These delays result in greater death rates and
worse
functional
outcomes
after
cardiac
and
neurological
emergencies1,3. The most common reason for the delay is the
time to activate medical care by patients and witnesses who do
not recognize the symptoms as serious, do not call an ambulance,
or take a watch-and-wait approach4.
Paradoxically, close family members worsen delay in cardiac
emergencies. In a study of 1102 patients with chest pain, the time
of evaluation before calling medical care by nonrelatives/cow-
orkers was ~19.7 min, family members ~30.2 min, and spouses
~35.1 min5. In other words, the fastest response times were for
patients surrounded by coworkers or nonrelatives, whereas family
members, particularly spouses, often suggested watch-and-wait
approaches. Nonfamily members were “just not as easily nego-
tiated with or dissuaded from usurping control or calling for
medical care” (p. 1308)5. In sum, the social situation is a major
factor in emergency decision-making and rival the effects of more
traditional individual patient factors such as demographic and
clinical characteristics.
Examining the social environment in medical emergencies is
also appropriate because most heart attacks and strokes occur in
the presence of others. For example, 80% of strokes occur in the
presence of others and ≈70% occur at patients’ homes6. Care-
givers or witnesses activate ≈96% of stroke emergency calls7.
Bystanders recognize stroke symptoms more often than patients
do, and more frequently advocate for action8. Therefore, the
earliest moments of a stroke is a group phenomenon involving at
least one caregiver and, often, multiple family members, friends,
or strangers communicating to determine whether and when
action should be taken. Consequently, delay is often the result of
the communications, decisions, and actions of multiple witnesses
working and thinking together9,10.
The network perspective provides a set of theories and meth-
ods to study the spread of information or behaviors in groups.
Research has shown that exercise11, weight gain12, and medica-
tion use13 may be contagious behaviors that flow through ties to
shape and constrain personal choices. A formal way to study
these influences is through well-known sociological theories
known as the strength of weak ties14 and structural holes15. These
approaches illustrate two archetypal network formations of social
capital: dense personal networks ideal for social support (e.g.,
bonding capital) and radial personal networks optimal for access
to novel information (e.g., bridging capital)16. Through these
structural motifs, personal networks act as conduits of health-
related social capital to identify symptoms, recognize a need for
support, and help secure access to services17, all of which are
critical in medical emergencies.
The purpose of this study is to understand the arrival to the
hospital as a collective process using network methods. We use
personal network analysis, also known as egocentric network
analysis, to map and understand the influence of the persons who
surround a stroke patient18. Specifically, we analyze patients’
personal network characteristics such as size and connectivity,
which represent conduits for information entry, exchange, and
disruption. We also examine the characteristics of each network
member to understand the diversity or likeness of potential wit-
nesses. Finally, we analyze descriptions of the communication
patterns that led to early or delayed arrival with attention to
underlying social mechanisms. The findings expose the unex-
pected role of patients’ social networks to shape decisions during
medical emergencies.
Results
Generating personal network data in stroke patients. We used
a survey to characterize the personal social network data of 175
patients within 5 days of stroke onset. The survey used tradi-
tional name generators from General Social Survey19,20 to
create network maps. For each patient, we were particularly
interested in quantifying the opportunities for the patient to
receive and control new information. Drawing on Burt’s con-
cept of social capital, we quantified the holes in the social
structure that allow the patient to be exposed to different flows
of information. For example, in Fig. 1, Patient A has a small and
close-knit, or high constraint, network with no structural holes
because each network member is strongly connected to all the
others leading to restricted information flow. Patient B has a
large and radial, or low constraint, network with structural
holes as the subgroup of friends (left) is not known to the other
subgroup (right) leading to two separate flows of information.
These principles were operationalized by calculating network

 size (number of nodes in network), Burt’s constraint (a measure
of close-knit structure), effective size (an inverse of constraint
with higher values indicating radial structure), and mean degree
(average number of ties per node) (see Methods for mathe-
matical descriptions).
We recruited a diverse set of patients with mostly mild motor-
predominant stroke (88% mild, 12% moderate). We focused on
mild stroke because patients with milder symptoms are at higher
risk of delay, and they were able to engage in the survey during
hospitalization. Table 1 lists their baseline demographic and
clinical characteristics. Of the 175 study participants, 108 arrived
at the hospital ≤6 h, and 67 arrived >6h after symptom onset. We
found that demographic and clinical traits did not differ between
individuals who refused and those who agreed to participate in
the study. We did note that delayed arrivers were more likely to
be Black/African American (42 vs. 25%, Fisher’s exact test p =
0.0309), and were less likely to be given tissue plasminogen
activator, a medication that dissolves blood clots given only if
stroke patients arrive within 4.5 h (0% vs. 50%, two-tailed t test p
<0.0001). The difference in treatment frequencies highlights one
of the main consequences of arriving late.
Small close-knit personal networks and slow arrival. The net-
works of slow arrivers were smaller and more close-knit than the
networks of fast arrivers. This was first evident when we created a
montage of all patients’ networks that showed slow arrivers’
networks were smaller and less spiky than fast arrivers’ networks
(Fig. 2). In statistical analysis of Burt’s social capital measures
(Table 2), unadjusted analysis confirmed significant differences in
network structure. Slow arrivers had smaller networks (mean 5,
interquartile range (IQR): 4–8) than fast arrivers (mean 8, IQR:
6–10, Wilcoxin rank sum test p < 0.0001). They also had higher
constraint (mean 61.11, IQR: 39.55–66.94) than fast arrivers
(mean 40.31, IQR: 35.85–54.09, Wilcoxin rank sum test p <
0.0001), meaning a more close-knit redundant network structure
with constricted information flow. Slow arrivers also had smaller
effective size and mean degree of network members, which fur-
ther supported the finding.
Analysis of network composition showed less-pronounced
differences. Slow arrivers had networks with a smaller range of
member ages (measured by the standard deviation of ages) and a
higher percentage of nonexercisers. The two groups did not differ
in the percentage kin, diversity of sex, or diversity of race.

 The results were similar after adjusting for known confounders
(Fig. 3). Based on the literature and our own univariate analyses,
we adjusted for age, stroke severity, emergency medical services
usage, living alone, education, race, and median income. Network
size and constraint remained strongly associated with increased
odds of delayed arrival in a multivariable analysis. Network size
had an adjusted odds ratio of 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]:
0.75–0.92, p = 0.0005), inversely related to delay. Constraint had
an adjusted odds ratio of 1.04 (95% CI: 1.02–1.06, p = 0.0001),
positively related to delay. Again, this was supported with the
other structural metrics that followed the pattern of closed
network structures relating to delay and open network structures
relating to early arrival. Thus, effective size and mean degree were
strongly associated with lower odds of delayed arrival. The
network composition measures were less markedly related to
arrival time, though remained significant after adjustment. Range
of the ages of network members (measured by the standard
deviation of ages) was associated with lower odds of delayed
arrival. Percentage of nonexercisers was associated with higher
odds of delayed arrival.
Constricted information flow in small close-knit networks. We
completed semistructured interviews in a subgroup of patients
and used qualitative analysis to understand the communication
sequences leading to hospital arrival. In 12 slow and 15 fast
arrivers, we found differences in the communication partners and
content regarding symptoms and plans (Supplementary Table 1).

 In 75% (9 persons) of slow arrivers, the first person contacted or
present at time of stroke was an emotionally close, strongly tied
person, such as a family member. Slow arrivers’ discussions with
their strongly connected confidants followed a spiraling pattern
toward nonaction: (1) The patient disclosed symptoms in a
delayed or selective manner. For example, one person stated, “I
wanted to wait and see what happens first.” (2) Symptoms were
over-negotiated. For instance, in a lengthy argument, one patient
declared to her husband, “No, you just wait. I’ll just go see my
doctor in the morning.” (3) Patients and caregivers reinforced
each other’s opinions to watch and wait. For example, a patient’s
husband and sister agreed and convinced the patient that the left-
sided numbness was not “anything to be concerned about…
because…it would come and just last for a few minutes and then
go away.”
In contrast, only 47% (7 persons) of fast arrivers contacted or
were with a strongly tied person, and a weak tie such as a friend
or stranger was more often involved. The content of discussion
also differed across the groups. Fast arrivers disclosed symptoms
quickly, did not negotiate, and did not validate others’ plans. For
instance, coworkers, who were weak ties in one patient’s network,
called 911 without discussion with the patient and said,
“Something is wrong with you. You need to go to the doctor.”
These more efficient communication sequences involved more
distant contacts leading to faster responses. In Supplementary
Movie 1, one patient describes two separate episodes of
neurological dysfunction in different social contexts associated
with divergent arrival times. Overall, the communication patterns
supported the idea that weak ties, which are more available in the
large and radial networks, were more likely to result in timely
arrival at the hospital.
Sensitivity analyses to verify findings. We completed sensitivity
analyses to examine the results with a time cutoff of 3 h, removal
of very small networks, and stratification by race. The associa-
tions of network structure (e.g., constraint) and composition
variables (e.g., percent kin) with delayed arrival did not change
with a time cutoff of 3 h (Supplementary Fig. 1) or with removal
of very small networks (Supplementary Fig. 2). Among Black/
African American participants (n = 57), associations of network
structure and composition with delayed arrival were not sig-
nificant, although the small sample size limited interpretation
(Supplementary Fig. 3). In persons who were not Black/African
American (n = 124), network structure variables were significant,
but network composition variables were not (Supplementary
Fig. 4). There was no significant interaction between Black/Afri-
can American race and the strongest network variables: con-
straint (adjusted OR = 0.98, 95% CI: 0.95–1.02, p = 0.39) or
network size (adjusted OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.89–1.35, p = 0.33).
Therefore, we concluded that the findings were robust when
considering a shorter time window and not driven solely by the
presence of very small networks. We also concluded that the
strongest network effects were not moderated or modified by
race.
Discussion
Our results confirm the paradoxical role of the social environ-
ment in medical emergencies. We found that stroke patients with
small and close-knit social networks had delayed hospital arrival
because of restricted information flow that reinforced the norm to
watch-and-wait. Conversely, patients with large and radial net-
works arrived sooner because of access to more diverse infor-
mation that led to more rapid recognition and action. Networks
that included persons with a narrow range of ages or who did not
exercise were also risk factors for delayed arrival, although less
markedly. These associations were independent of typical risk
factors, such as age, stroke severity, emergency medical services
usage, living alone, socioeconomic status (education and median
income), and race.
The findings suggest a general solution to the social environ-
mental paradox in heart attacks and strokes. Family member
cause a patient to delay not because of their particular blindness
to the problem. Rather, the patient is likely embedded in a closed
social network structure in which family members are more
prevalent. Such a social structure provides reinforcement for
prevailing norms due to reduced access to information or
diversity of opinions. This results in a communication sequence
in which symptoms are not disclosed promptly, plans are over-
negotiated, and strategies to wait are unproblematically validated.
Such an interpretation is supported by the literature on the
importance of the broader social context on risk of delay in
multiple countries9,10,21,22. Our study moves beyond current lit-
erature by using network mapping to reveal social processes
rather than proxies of social life such as living alone, being
unmarried, or summative social network indices9. Our analysis
suggests that social capital, defined by network metrics, serves a
critical role in medical emergencies.
The importance of weak ties and the potential for mispercep-
tions in closed networks have strong theoretical and empirical
support in sociology14,15. Weak interpersonal ties have been
shown to provide diverse ideas and disruptive opinions informed
by unique experiences not shared by other members of the net-
work23. For instance, individuals in networks rich with weak ties
benefit by acquiring information and brokering diverse resources
that lead to success in getting a job, being promoted, or adjusting
to new circumstances24. Conversely, in strongly tied, close-knit
groups, information is recycled inside an “echo chamber,” and all
persons overestimate the collective support for existing norms.
This leads to selective disclosure (e.g., not revealing symptoms
immediately) and false consensus-building (e.g., agreeing to
watch and wait), both of which were evident in our data25. Some
researchers have called this phenomenon “pluralistic ignorance”25
or the “majority illusion,” in which an individuals’ local obser-
vations are distorted by the choices and behaviors of their closest
social contacts.
Increased focus on social context could benefit stroke pre-
paredness campaigns in multiple ways. First, our findings suggest
a shift from mass education of stroke symptom recognition,
which has not substantially improved arrival times2,26, to a more
socially targeted approach. We suggest that practitioners should
use a brief survey to map patients’ networks during a primary
care visit or hospitalization for transient ischemic attack, stroke,
or myocardial infarction and identify patients who have small and
close-knit networks. At-risk patients and available network
members could be offered a network intervention that uses social
network data to enhance behavior change. For example, the at-
risk patient and network may be taught about stroke symptoms,
communication pitfalls, and development of an action plan that
avoids pitfalls, such as calling a designated friend. Further study is
needed on the efficacy, implementation, and cost-effectiveness of
such interventions.
The strengths of our study include the use of social network
analysis and mixed methods to understand the social contexts of
patients with acute stroke. We also controlled for known demo-
graphic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors involved in timely
hospital arrival. Finally, we offered a mechanistic understanding
of the social influences supported by clinical and sociological
literature that suggests ideas for new interventions.
Limitations of our study include the effect of unmeasured
confounders. Although we addressed this issue in several ways
including measuring factors described in the literature and using

 a multivariable regression, it is still possible that unmeasured
confounders could explain the observed difference in arrival time.
In addition, our results have limited generalizability. Our cohort
included patients with mostly mild stroke. Given that mild stroke
is a risk factor for delayed arrival4, we were examining a high-risk
cohort. However, since severity predicts time to arrival, social
networks may not be important in moderate or severe stroke.
Moreover, selection bias may have been introduced by a small
sample size of slow arrivers and exclusion of patients who could
not participate in the interview survey, such non-English speak-
ers, patients with severe strokes or aphasia, and patients who left
before recruitment. Study of a more diverse population is war-
ranted. We also did not assess knowledge of stroke symptoms in
the participants, which could have been a covariate or mechanism
that deserves further study. Lastly, the survey relied on patients’
self-reports of their social networks. Although participants’ report
of their personal networks of intimate contacts has been shown to
be accurate27, there is still a possibility that patients had recall
bias of their social context influenced by their journey to the
hospital. A future direction of research could be to survey the
network members after stroke or heart attack to understand why
and how relatives choose a watch and wait approach more than
nonrelatives.
In summary, the decision to seek medical care after stroke is
often a social process. Our study shows that patients with small
and close-knit social networks are more likely to have delayed
hospital arrival after stroke. Our communication analyses suggest
this is because slow arrivers tend to contact strongly tied persons
with whom they selectively disclose symptoms, over-negotiate
plans, and reinforce a watch-and-wait strategy. This is in contrast
to fast arrivers who are more likely to contact or be surrounded
by weakly tied individuals who act without negotiation. Network
interventions that identify patients with small and close-knit
networks before stroke and offer strategies to avoid commu-
nication
pitfalls
deserve
further
study
to
improve
stroke
preparedness.
Methods
Study design and participants. The study was a cross-sectional design in which
we recruited patients with mostly mild stroke from two academic hospitals, Barnes
Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, MO and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston,
MA, between May 2014 and May 2017. The primary outcome was binary in the
form of arrival ≤6 h or >6 h of stroke symptom onset based on medical records,
review of acute treatments administered, and patient report. Stroke symptom onset
was defined as the time a patient became aware of symptoms. We also did a
sensitivity analysis for arrival before or after 3 h. All arrival timings were adjudi-
cated by at least two study team members, one of whom was a neurologist (A.D.).
We chose the 6 h threshold because it has been associated with favorable clinical
outcomes, irrespective of whether patients receive reperfusion therapy or not3.
Particularly in mild-stroke patients, who may not receive thrombolysis, this cutoff
is associated with favorable outcomes due to a combination of early therapy,
monitoring, and intervention if patients worsen3. We chose a categorical outcome,
rather than continuous, because we could not determine the times with enough
precision or accuracy for a meaningful continuous outcome.
We enrolled consecutive patients during their hospitalization if they were (1)
diagnosed with a first ischemic stroke, (2) 21 years and older, and (3) within 7 days
of clinical stroke. Patients were excluded if they had any of the following: (1) prior
ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, (2) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
(NIHSS) score > 21, (3) significant aphasia (score > 1 on the language section of the
NIHSS), (4) inability to speak English, (5) lack of capacity to consent or participate
in the survey interview, (6) diagnosis of dementia or short-blessed test score > 6.
All participants provided written informed consent. The institutional review
boards at Barnes Jewish Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital approved all
study protocols and consent forms. For the movie, the participant provided consent
to publish her image.
Measurements. A study coordinator administered the social network survey at the
patient’s bedside, usually between days 2 and 5 of stroke hospitalization. The
instrument was an adaptation of the General Social Survey20 and a national survey
of personal networks and health28. The main sections were a name generator, name
inter-relater, and name interpreter. In the name generator section, participants
named people with whom they had discussed important matters, socialized, or
sought support in the last 3 months. In the name inter-relater section, participants
determined the connections among all persons in the network and evaluated the
strength of the relationship ties. In the name interpreter section, participants
answered questions about characteristics and health habits of each individual in the
network. Specific question forms are provided in Supplementary Methods 118, and
instrument psychometric properties are described by Burt20.
Network structure is a quantitative description of the arrangement of social ties
in a patient’s social network. Network size is defined as the number of individuals
in the network, excluding the patient. Constraint is the degree to which each
network member is connected to the others. Constraint summarizes network size
(larger networks are less constraining), density (networks with more connectivity
are more constraining), tie strength (networks with more strong ties are more
constraining), and hierarchy of ties (networks in which all contacts are exclusively
tied to a single contact are more constraining)24,25. Effective size is the number of
nonredundant members in the network, conceptually an inverse metric of
constraint29. Notably, although we recorded the first responder only for the
subgroup who provided qualitative data (discussed below), constraint and effective
size account for the number of weak vs. strong ties available to the patient during
the emergency. Therefore, these are indirect measures of who could be present at
the time of stroke. Mean degree is the average number of ties of a network member,
excluding the patient, indicating the distribution of ties in the network. Equations
to calculate these measures are provided in the Supplementary Methods 2.
Network composition is the proportion of characteristics across members in the
network. Percentage kin is ratio of network members who are family. The standard
deviation of network members’ age reflects the range of ages of people in the
network around the patient. The diversity of sex index (or the index of qualitative
variation) represents the mix of men and women in the network with a value of 0
meaning all network members are one sex and a value of 1 indicating equal mix of
men and women30. The diversity of race is the mix of races in the network with a
value of 0 indicating that all persons were of the same race. The percentage of
network members who do not exercise or had a stroke are the proportion of
individuals who fit each of those categories.
Statistical analysis. We compared demographic and clinical characteristics
between fast and slow arrivers using an unpaired two-tailed t test or Wilcoxon rank
sum test (if nonparametric distribution) for continuous variables and χ2 test or
Fisher’s exact test (if less than five in a cell) for categorical variables. We then
completed a series of univariate logistic regressions of the demographic, clinical,
and network characteristics in relation to arrival time before or after 6 h.
Multivariable analysis was used to determine the association between the
strongest social network variables in univariate analysis and delayed arrival. We
adjusted for age, stroke severity, emergency medical services usage, living alone,
education, race, and median income. The first four variables are well described in
the literature as risk factors for delayed hospital arrival4,9. We used the last three to
determine whether any social network effects are independent of socioeconomic
status26.
We performed a series of logistic regression models using sequential block-wise
entry. We tested each network metric separately, as advised in the network
literature, due to collinearity31. All hypothesis tests were two-sided with the level of
significance set at P value < 0.05. The sequential models allowed assessment of
individual covariates and comparison of model fit using the log likelihood.
We performed a number of sensitivity analyses including testing our results
with a different time cutoff (less than or greater than 3 h), and whether removal of
the very small networks (fewer than four members) would alter the results. We also
examined the effects of race by stratified and interaction analyses of Black/African
American race. All analyses were completed in R version 3.3.232.
Qualitative analysis. Using semistructured interviews with a subgroup of patients,
we asked about the journey to the hospital, including recognition of symptoms,
decision-making, and context of the stroke onset. Open-ended questions, included
(1) What were the steps you went through from the start of stroke symptoms to
arriving at the hospital? (2) Who did you first speak to about your symptoms? (3)
Why did you choose to speak with that person? (4) Were you in a public place? (5)
Who was the first person to help you? (6) How did you decide how to get to the
hospital? (7) What was the most important factor in getting to the hospital?
Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed.
We used qualitative analysis to understand the arrival process and relate it to
quantitative patterns. Using the framework method33, we read and reflected on all
interviews, coded recurrent ideas, grouped ideas into themes, and formalized these
into a framework and coding index. Finally, we applied the agreed upon index to all
transcripts and examined the relationship of the qualitative themes with the
quantitative patterns. Two investigators (A.D. and M.T.) independently coded
transcripts, agreed on the coding index, and discussed and resolved all
disagreements in the final coding.
