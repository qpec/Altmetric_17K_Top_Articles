Abstract
Background—The UNAIDS “90-90-90” global treatment target aims to achieve 73% virologic 
suppression among HIV-infected persons worldwide by 2020.
Objective—Using a microsimulation model of HIV detection, disease and treatment, we estimate 
the clinical and economic value of reaching this ambitious goal in South Africa.
Design—We model: the Current Pace strategy, simulating existing scale-up efforts and gradual 
increases in overall virologic suppression from 24% to 36% in 5 years; and the UNAIDS Target 
strategy, simulating 73% suppression in 5 years.

 Data Sources—Published estimates and South African survey data inform HIV transmission 
rates (0.16–9.03/100PY), HIV-specific age-stratified fertility rates (1.0–9.1/100PY), and costs 
(ART: $11–31/month, routine care: $20–157/month).
Target population—South African HIV-infected population, including incident infections over 
the next ten years
Perspective—Modified societal perspective, excluding time and productivity costs
Time Horizon—Five and ten years
Interventions—Aggressive HIV case-detection, efficient linkage to care, rapid treatment scale-
up and adherence/retention interventions toward the UNAIDS Target strategy
Outcome Measures—HIV transmissions, deaths, years of life saved (YLS), maternal orphans, 
costs (2014USD), and cost-effectiveness
Base Case Analysis—Compared to Current Pace over (5- and) 10-years, the UNAIDS Target 
strategy would avert (873,000) 2,051,000 HIV transmissions, (1,174,000) 2,478,000 deaths, and 
(726,000) 1,689,000 maternal orphans, while saving (3,002,000) 13,340,000 life-years. The 
additional budget required for the UNAIDS Target strategy would be ($7.965) $15.979 billion, 
yielding an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ($2,720/YLS) $1,260/YLS, (<50%) 
<20% of South Africa per capita GDP.
Results of Sensitivity Analysis—Outcomes generally varied <20% from base case outcomes 
when we varied key input parameters within plausible ranges.
Limitations—Several pathways may lead to 73% overall suppression which were examined in 
sensitivity analysis.
Conclusions—Reaching the “90-90-90” HIV suppression target would be costly but both 
extraordinarily effective and cost-effective in South Africa. Global health policy makers should 
mobilize the political and economic support to make the 90-90-90 aspiration a reality.

INTRODUCTION
In September 2014, the Joint Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) launched 
“90-90-90: An ambitious treatment target to help end the AIDS epidemic” by 2020. The 
90-90-90 goal aims to: diagnose 90% of HIV-infected persons worldwide; link 90% of these 
to antiretroviral therapy (ART); and achieve 90% virologic suppression among ART 
recipients. Such coverage would produce virologic suppression in 73% (=0.90*0.90*0.90) of 
patients worldwide, a marked increase from current estimates of 29% (1). 90-90-90 
addresses the so-called “HIV treatment cascade,” documenting attrition in the continuum of 
care leading from HIV diagnosis, through linkage to care, to suppression on ART and 
retention. Current South African estimates suggest that 67% of HIV-infected patients are 
undiagnosed and/or unlinked, 33% receive ART, and only 24% are virologically suppressed 
(2).

 While much has been said and written about the moral and public health imperative to 
implement 90-90-90 (1, 3), comparatively little is known about how reaching its treatment 
targets will translate into broader, downstream health and social outcomes of interest: 
survival, new transmissions, numbers of children becoming orphans, and costs. Given the 
magnitude of the investment that this initiative will require, policy makers and international 
partners (e.g., the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the Global Fund, and the 
World Bank) deserve to know what return they can anticipate on their investment.
METHODS
Analytic Overview
We use the Cost-effectiveness of Preventing AIDS Complications–International (CEPAC-I) 
model and South African data to compare the Current Pace strategy to the UNAIDS Target 
strategy. We project the progress of cohorts through the continuum of care for ten years, 
taking into account new infections, diagnoses, ART initiations, and ART-associated 
virologic outcomes. Over both 5- and 10-year horizons, we project the following outcomes: 
cumulative HIV transmissions, deaths, years of life saved, numbers of children becoming 
orphans, lifetime costs (in 2014USD), and incremental cost-effectiveness. Outcomes are 
reported both undiscounted (for clinical and budget impact purposes) and discounted at 3% 
annually (for cost-effectiveness evaluation).
Cohort Definitions
The current population of HIV-infected adults (≥15 years) in South Africa (the “prevalent 
cohort”) is assigned at model outset to stages in the care continuum: 67% undiagnosed, 
unlinked to care, or otherwise not on ART; 9% unsuppressed on ART; and 23% and 1% of 
the total HIV-infected population suppressed on first- and second-line ART (2, 4). Each year, 
we introduce an incident cohort and thereafter combine outcomes of the 2016 prevalent 
cohort and all later incident cohorts.
The CEPAC-I Model—CEPAC-I is a microsimulation of HIV disease progression and 
treatment in resource-limited settings (5). CEPAC-I aggregates the experience of large 
numbers of individual patients to project the population-level impact of alternative treatment 
scale-up policies (6). Individual patient characteristics (e.g., age, gender, CD4 count, HIV 
RNA) are generated by random draws from distributions, some of which (e.g., CD4) are 
dependent on the simulated patient’s stage in the HIV continuum of care at model outset (i.e. 
not in care, on ART suppressed, on ART not suppressed, Table 1, top). CEPAC-I simulates 
the success and failure of disease detection, linkage to care, ART initiation, virologic 
suppression, and retention in care. It also simulates risks of opportunistic infections (OI), 
which increase with falling CD4 counts. Undetected or otherwise unlinked patients 
experience immunologic/CD4 decline. HIV is detected through testing or the development 
of an OI. Only patients achieving virologic suppression on ART experience CD4 increases; 
unsuppressed ART patients achieve no CD4 recovery and continue to face reduced CD4-
specific OI risk while accruing ART costs (5).

 For those initiating ART, the 48-week virologic suppression rate is 72% (2, 10). HIV RNA is 
monitored according to South African guidelines (11). Patients in whom ART failure is 
detected may be switched to a second-line regimen, if one is available. Patients in care are at 
an adherence-dependent risk of loss-to-follow-up at monthly rates ranging from 0.2–1.1%, 
resulting in an 80% probability of remaining in care at 5 years (12–14). Additional model 
detail – including model figures, flowcharts, state space definitions, user guides, data fields, 
protocols for data assembly, and stopping rules – can be found at: http://
www.massgeneral.org/mpec/cepac/.
Transmissions—To estimate HIV transmission, we use the model’s unique capacity to 
report monthly, patient-level information on HIV RNA. We make the assumption that HIV 
viral load drives the rate at which infected individuals transmit HIV to others. We link 
published estimates of viral-load-specific transmission (15, 16) to monthly CEPAC-I output 
on each patient’s viral load (Table 1). This method -- and the published data employed -- 
does not consider age, gender or risk-group but instead uses aggregated transmission events 
stratified by viral load. In the model, patient viral load depends on the baseline HIV RNA 
value (17) and whether the patient is acutely infected (18); virologically suppressed; either 
becoming suppressed or rebounding; or at an advanced disease stage (CD4 ≤0.200 × 109 
cells/L). During the 6-month period of acute infection, we amplify transmissions 7.25-fold 
(16). The cumulative viral load estimated by the model across all patients and all 12 months 
is employed to estimate the yearly number of incident infections over a 10-year horizon.
Clinical Outcomes—For each of the yearly cohorts, the CEPAC-I Model provides the 
monthly distribution of all living patients – including those newly-infected – across the 
various stages of the cascade. The output also provides, for each year: the numbers of 
deaths, the number of persons alive at each stage in the continuum of HIV care (i.e. not in 
care, on ART not suppressed, on ART suppressed), and the cumulative years of life accrued 
to both prevalent and incident cohorts.
Maternal Orphans—We consider the children of HIV-infected women in 2016 (current 
children) and children projected to be born to HIV-infected women over the next ten years 
(new children). We define maternal orphans as children <18 years old whose mother has 
died from HIV/AIDS (19). We also report results for particularly vulnerable orphans <5 
years of age. Numbers of orphans and their ages are estimated using country- and age-
specific fertility rates, derived from the United Nations and Statistics South Africa, corrected 
for women’s HIV prevalence by age (20–22). We adjust our estimate to take into account: 
reductions in fertility due to HIV infection (23); the risk of child mortality, both prior to and 
after becoming orphaned (24); and the possibility that an orphan will attain the age of 18 
years (and thus no longer meet the definition of orphanhood), at some point in the 10-year 
time horizon. We tally both cumulative orphans (i.e., all children orphaned between 2016–
2026) and current orphans (i.e., living orphans <18 years old at a given time).
Costs—First- and second-line ART costs are $137 and $375/year (25). HIV-related care 
costs include OI treatment, laboratory monitoring, and CD4-stratified routine care costs 
(Table 1) (26, 27). When necessary, year-specific Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators

 are used to first update all South African costs to 2014 Rand and subsequently converted to 
2014 USD (28, 29).
Strategies
The Current Pace strategy reflects current HIV detection, treatment, and retention activities 
in South Africa, resulting in gradual increases in overall virologic suppression from 24% to 
36% and 44% over the next 5 and 10 years (Table 1).
For the UNAIDS Target Strategy, we adjust parameters in the CEPAC-I model to achieve the 
objectives of the 90-90-90 initiative in South Africa. Model output demonstrates that both 
testing, on average, every two years and linking 50% of identified cases, are required to 
achieve 90% diagnosis and 90% on ART in 5 years. Average CD4 at ART initiation among 
those in the previously undetected prevalent and incident cohorts increases to 0.305 and 
0.364 × 109 cells/L (from 0.124 and 0.167 × 109 cells/L), respectively. To achieve overall 
virologic suppression of 73%, we assume the routine implementation of a highly effective, 
monthly adherence/retention intervention. Such a program might require intensive, door-to-
door services costing as much as $13/person on ART/month, a figure reported by a study of 
a comparably exhaustive, community-based intervention (31). Although there are no 
currently available reports of an intervention of this scope and efficacy, we assume here that 
this intervention could increase both 48-week ART suppressive efficacy from 72% (under 
Current Pace) to 87% and the 5-year probability of retention in care from 80% to 88%.
The UNAIDS Target strategy adds substantial costs for case detection. The costs of 
extensive outreach are assumed to be $20 per positive test and $7 per negative test (31). The 
number of persons tested each year is estimated by dividing the number of persons linked to 
treatment by the proportion of the population >15yo with undiagnosed HIV. As undiagnosed 
prevalence decreases from 8% to ~2% over ten years, an increased number of negative tests 
are required to find each unlinked HIV-infected person.
Sensitivity Analyses
To examine the robustness of our findings in the face of changes in the underlying data, we 
conduct numerous one-way and multi-way sensitivity analyses, varying input parameters 
across a broad range of plausible alternative values. Parameters of interest include: the 
duration of acute infection (base value = 6 months; plausible range = 3–12 months); the 
efficiency of testing and linkage (base linkage rate = 50%; plausible range = 25%–90%); 
annual ART costs (base values = $137 and $375 for 1st- and 2nd-line, respectively; plausible 
ranges = 50–100% of base values); the cost of adherence/retention interventions (base value 
= $155; plausible range = 50–200% of base value). We also consider alternative pathways 
leading to the UNAIDS virologic suppression target.
RESULTS
Cascade Results for the Two Strategies
Our model predictions of the fraction of the population in each cascade stage at the end of 
year 1 under the Current Pace strategy are calibrated to published estimates and are within

 an absolute 3% at each stage (Figure 1, gray bars versus hatched black bars) (2). The Current 
Pace strategy results in gradually improved cascade outcomes; by year 10, 44% of living 
HIV-infected persons are suppressed (dark blue bars). The UNAIDS Target strategy achieves 
81% diagnosis and 74% virologic suppression (light green bars) by year 5; by year 10, the 
suppression rate among living HIV-infected persons is 80% (dark green bars).
Taking into account incident cases and deaths over the next decade, we project under the 
Current Pace strategy, that 2.632 million South Africans will be suppressed on ART, and 
2.963 million will remain undiagnosed or unlinked to care (Figure 2, light green and light 
blue). Under the UNAIDS Target strategy, we project more than 2 million fewer persons 
undiagnosed or not in care (870,000) and almost 2.5 million more on suppressive ART 
(5.070 million, Figure 2, dark blue and dark green).
HIV Transmissions
Under the Current Pace strategy, we project 450,000 HIV transmissions in year 1 (32), 
yielding an annual incidence of 1.80%. We validated this model-driven incidence by 
comparing it to the annual incidence among 15–49 year-olds, which the 2012 South Africa 
HIV National survey reports as 1.72% (22). Over ten years, we project 4.413 million new 
infections (Table 2; Appendix Figure 1, blue line). Under the UNAIDS Target strategy, 2.362 
million new infections are projected over ten years (Table 2), suggesting 2.051 million 
transmissions averted (Appendix Figure 1, green line).
Deaths and Life-Years Saved
Over the next ten years and inclusive of each year’s newly transmitted cases, the Current 
Pace and the UNAIDS Target strategies will result in 4.985 million and 2.507 million 
cumulative deaths among HIV-infected persons. Over 5- and 10-year horizons, the UNAIDS 
Target strategy will result in 3.002 million and 13.340 million additional years of life saved 
(YLS), compared to the Current Pace strategy (Table 2).
Maternal Orphans
In 2013, there were an estimated 900,000 living maternal orphans due to HIV/AIDS in 
South Africa (19, 33). Under the Current Pace strategy, 2.979 million more children will be 
orphaned due to HIV infection within 10 years; in 2026, accounting for orphan mortality and 
“aging out,” we project 2.443 million living maternal orphans. In contrast, reaching the 
UNAIDS Target strategy, we project a cumulative 1.290 million children orphaned with 
1.185 million living orphans in 10 years, a cumulative difference of 1.689 million orphans 
(Table 2, Figure 3).
Costs and Cost-effectiveness
Model output demonstrates an average annual cost of $930 for patients in care and on ART, 
consistent with annual patient costs previously reported in South Africa (34). Total 5- and 
10-year costs for the Current Pace strategy are $18.674 billion and $38.353 billion, of which 
$1.986 billion (11%) and $4.415 billion (12%) are ART costs (Table 2). Total 5- and 10-year 
costs for the UNAIDS Target strategy are $26.639 billion and $54.332 billion, of which 
$3.409 billion (13%) and $8.032 billion (15%) are ART costs, $1.182 billion (4%) and 
Walensky et al.

 $2.045 billion (4%) are testing costs, and $3.604 billion (14%) and $7.858 billion (14%) are 
adherence/retention intervention costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 
the UNAIDS Target compared to the Current Pace strategy (Δcosts/ΔYLS) is $2,720/YLS 
and $1,260/YLS over 5- and 10-years. These ICERs represent 42% and 19% of the South 
African per capita GDP ($6,500) (28), suggesting that the UNAIDS Target strategy is very 
cost-effective by international standards in this South African setting (35).
Sensitivity Analyses
Changing the duration of acute HIV infection from 6 months to 12 (3) months resulted in 
larger (smaller) incremental benefits from the UNAIDS Target strategy in terms of 
cumulative deaths, years of life saved, and orphans averted. Most variations in these 
sensitivity analyses remained <20% from the base case (Appendix Table 1).
With lower testing and linkage rates but increased ART adherence in the UNAIDS Target 
strategy, we achieved 72% virologic suppression at year 5 via an alternative pathway 
(Appendix Figure 2, light purple bars). This alternative UNAIDS Target strategy nearly 
reached the 73% suppression endpoint but failed to meet the interim targets of 90% 
diagnosed and 90% on ART, resulting in less favorable UNAIDS Target outcomes due to the 
decreased proportion of persons receiving ART and HIV care (Appendix Table 1).
With a halving of testing/linkage efficiency (only 25% of HIV-infected patients link to care 
each time they test positive) and a doubling of per-person adherence/retention costs, the 
UNAIDS Target strategy remained both very expensive ($31.445 billion, $64.370 billion), 
and also very cost-effective ($4,330/YLS, $2,040/YLS) at 5 and 10 years. Conversely, if 
testing/linkage efficiency reached 90% and adherence/retention intervention and ART costs 
were both halved, the 5- and 10-year costs of the UNAIDS Target strategy would be $21.487 
billion and $42.726 billion, and the strategy would be substantially more cost-effective 
($1,490/YLS, $600/YLS, Appendix Table 2).
CONCLUSIONS
UNAIDS is right to label the 90-90-90 initiative “a momentous opportunity” to “end the 
AIDS epidemic.” (1) We considered a wide range of clinical, epidemiological, and social 
performance standards by which policymakers and donors might measure return on 
investment. By every one of these measures, achieving the UNAIDS Target strategy could 
have a transformative impact: averting millions of new HIV infections; saving millions of 
lives and tens of millions of years of life; preventing millions of children from becoming 
orphans; and thereby curtailing the global pandemic. And while it will not be easy and it 
certainly will not be inexpensive, we also find that it will be highly cost-effective and well 
worth trying.
It will not be easy. Our analysis suggests that the 90-90-90 performance targets can only be 
attained if every step in the continuum leading from HIV detection to durable viral 
suppression can be made to function sustainably at “best practice” levels. For example, we 
find that 90% rates of diagnosis and linkage will require aggressive HIV screening, likely as 
often as once every two years, across the South African population. Further, achieving 73%

 overall virologic suppression will require individual 48-week ART suppression rates of 
~87% accompanied by 5-year retention rates of nearly 90%. These performance levels are as 
good as those reported in the most rigorous of US-based and international clinical trials, 
which generally bias enrollment to the most adherent (36). While we emphasize that these 
are ambitious performance targets, they are plausible: emerging evidence suggests that best 
practices can be implemented and sustained, both in resource-rich and resource-constrained 
settings. For example, very high virologic suppression rates at the population level have 
already been reported from Australia (62%), United Kingdom (58%), and the higher-
burdened Botswana (70%) (37, 38).
It will not be inexpensive. We estimate a cost in South Africa of $54 billion over the next 10 
years, an increase of $16 billion over current HIV detection and treatment efforts. To place 
this in perspective, the 2014–2015 South Africa National Strategic Plan proposed $2.8 
billion needed in 2014–2015 for combined efforts in HIV, tuberculosis and sexually 
transmitted infection (STI) prevention and treatment (39). This would require a 14% annual 
budget increase over ten years ($54 billion total) for the required investment to be met. 
However, this analysis also highlights that such investments would yield extraordinary 
returns. Scale-up would be as cost-effective as ART itself (5, 26, 40, 41), and may be even 
more cost-effective in settings with higher HIV prevalence, especially among the young. 
This compelling cost-effectiveness case holds even though our analysis excludes both the 
social and economic value of keeping mothers alive and the productivity costs saved by 
curbing the HIV epidemic over time. In short, we find that while reaching the UNAIDS 
Target strategy exceeds current budgetary allocations, it would be a very cost-effective 
proposition.
Like any model-based exploration of a yet-to-be-implemented intervention, our analysis is 
limited by uncertainties in the input data and by some inevitable simplifications in our 
portrayal of the system. Key uncertainties and limitations include: omission of alternative 
plausible pathways that might lead to 73% virologic suppression; use of a single parameter 
to characterize phenomena that may vary by gender (e.g. differences in rates of testing or 
transmission); exclusion of orphans’ outcomes in the calculation of deaths and years of life 
saved; exclusion of any increased non-HIV medical clinical outcomes and costs (related to, 
for example, cardiovascular disease) resulting from reduced transmission and prolonged 
survival; and exclusion of other social and economic effects (e.g., labor force participation, 
economic productivity, financial protection and impoverishment) as outcomes of interest. 
Additionally, we highlight that this analysis is specific to both the South African setting and 
time in the epidemic. While we have made every effort to report these uncertainties 
transparently and to bias the analysis whenever possible against the cost-effectiveness 
conclusions, it is the striking robustness of our findings (+/−20%) in the face of the many 
uncertainties that is notable.
We find that if the 90-90-90 targets for HIV diagnosis, on ART, and virologic suppression 
can each be achieved in South Africa, enormous population and clinical benefits will follow. 
Broad variation in our key input parameters across their plausible ranges produced relatively 
small swings in overall outcomes and did little to undermine the overall conclusion that 
90-90-90 can work, that it offers decision makers and donors a superb return on investment,

 Appendix Figure 2. HIV treatment cascade by cascade strategy; sensitivity analysis of an 
alternative way of reaching virologic suppression goals for the UNAIDS Target strategy
This demonstrates results of the HIV treatment cascade over time, examining the proportion 
of patients alive (vertical axis) who are unlinked, on ART, or virologically suppressed 
(horizontal axis). Current Pace strategy: The hatched black bar on the left demonstrates 
literature-based data to inform the current South Africa cascade of care. The grey bar 
represents model-based results after 1 year of the current cascade and demonstrates a near 
match to the black bar, except for some anticipated modest improvement over time, with 
slight decreases among those unlinked with concomitant increases in those suppressed. Bars 
in blue provide current cascade results over 5-year (light blue) and 10-year (dark blue) and 
further demonstrate modest improvements in the cascade. At 10 years, the current cascade 
shows 44% of those alive are virologically suppressed. UNAIDS Target strategy and 
Alternative UNAIDS Target strategy. This figure utilizes alternative input parameters (lower 
testing and linkage rates and higher rates of virologic suppression), compared to the 
UNAIDS Target strategy base case to achieve viral suppression goals in the Alternative 
UNAIDS Target strategy, without 81% of persons on ART. The hatched white bar on the far 
right demonstrates the aspirational 90-90-90 cascade with 73% virologically suppressed. 
Model output demonstrates 90-90-90 basecase results that might be achieved in 5 and 10

 years (in light and dark green) and cascade states at 5 and 10 years in the Alternative 
UNAIDS Target strategy (light and dark purple). While the UNAIDS Target strategy and the 
Alternative UNAIDS Target strategy have similar viral suppression rates (~73%), they differ 
in the proportion of persons on ART (81% in the UNAIDS Target strategy and 75% in the 
Alternative UNAIDS Target strategy). The denominators (number alive) in these three 
strategies over time differ as a result of differences in the number of transmissions and 
deaths.

 Figure 1. HIV treatment cascade by cascade strategy
This figure demonstrates the results of the HIV treatment cascade over time, examining the 
percent of patients alive (vertical axis) who are unlinked (undiagnosed or previously linked 
and now lost-to-follow-up), on ART, or virologically suppressed (horizontal axis). Current 
Pace strategy: The hatched black bar on the left demonstrates literature-derived data on the 
current South Africa cascade of care. The grey bar represents model-based results after 1 
year of the current cascade and demonstrates a near match to the black bar, except for some 
anticipated modest improvement over time, with slight decreases among those unlinked and 
concomitant increases in those suppressed. Bars in blue provide Current Pace results over 5-
year (light blue) and 10-year horizons (dark blue) and further demonstrate modest 
improvements in the cascade. At 10-years, the Current Pace shows 44% of those alive are 
virologically suppressed. UNAIDS Target strategy: The hatched white bar on the far right 
demonstrates the aspirational UNAIDS Target strategy with 73% virologically suppressed. 
Model output demonstrates UNAIDS Target strategy results that might be achieved in 5 
years (light green). The screening, linkage, adherence and retention parameters of the model 
were adjusted to force the light green bars to reach 90-90-90 target values; we were able to 
achieve 80% of patients alive with virologic suppression in 10 years. Importantly, the 
denominators (number alive) in the two strategies over time differ due to an increased 
number of transmissions and deaths in the Current Pace strategy.

 Figure 2. Comparison of survival outcomes over time by cascade strategy
This figure provides a side-by-side comparison of the cumulative outcomes over time 
between the Current Pace strategy (light bars) and the UNAIDS Target strategy (dark bars). 
The cumulative number of HIV-infected persons, including those who have died, is on the 
vertical axis. Black/gray shading indicate the number who have died; blue shading indicates 
the number who are undiagnosed and/or unlinked; orange shading indicates the number who 
are unsuppressed on ART; and green shading indicates the number who are suppressed on 
ART. The difference in the height of the bars in each year indicates the cumulative number 
of additional transmissions in the Current Pace strategy compared to the UNAIDS Target 
strategy.

 Figure 3. Outcomes related to maternal orphans by cascade strategy
The vertical axis represents the number of maternal orphans (defined as children <18 years 
old whose mother has died of HIV/AIDS) over time (horizontal axis). Results from the 
Current Pace strategy are indicated by blue lines and results of the UNAIDS Target strategy 
are indicated by green lines. Cumulative orphans are denoted by the dashed lines, which 
demonstrate the cumulative number of children ever orphaned by HIV/AIDS during the time 
horizon of the analysis (see Methods). Solid lines indicate the projected number of current 
orphans in a given year, accounting for both death among orphans after orphanhood and for 
aging out of being considered an orphan. The kinks in the solid lines at year ~8 demonstrate 
the aging out of a large majority of prevalent orphans aged 9–14 years old at model 
initiation. The dotted lines indicate the number of living orphans <5 years old.

*When reported as medians and interquartile ranges, CD4 cell counts were converted to means and standard deviations for reporting purposes.
†During the period of acute infection, the transmission rate is 7.25 times the transmission rate of the highest viral load stratum (>100,000 copies/
mL).
‡Using age-specific HIV prevalence as well as age-specific fertility rate risk ratios between HIV-infected and uninfected, we derived HIV- and age-
specific fertility rates. These rates/100PY translate into a total fertility rate (TFR) for HIV-infected: 2.0, TFR for HIV-uninfected: 2.7 (20, 22, 23)
§Adherence/retention intervention affects ART efficacy (% suppressed) and attenuates loss to follow-up as described in the Methods.

†Subtraction is done prior to rounding, which accounts for any discrepancy.
‡We define maternal orphans as children <18 years (216 months) whose mother has died from HIV/AIDS. We also report results for particularly vulnerable orphans <5 years (60 months) of age.
§Clinical outcomes and total costs are reported undiscounted; ICERs are calculated as Δ$/ΔYLS of UNAIDS Target strategy compared to Current Pace strategy. Discounted values at 3% per year are used 
for incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.
