From October through mid-December 2015, influenza activity 
remained low in most regions of the United States. Activity began 
to increase in late December 2015 and continued to increase slowly 
through early February 2016. Influenza A viruses have been most 
frequently identified, with influenza A (H3N2) viruses predominat-
ing during October until early December, and influenza A (H1N1)
pdm09 viruses predominating from mid-December until early 
February. Most of the influenza viruses characterized during that 
time are antigenically similar to vaccine virus strains recommended 
for inclusion in the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. This 
report summarizes U.S. influenza activity* during October 4, 
2015–February 6, 2016, and updates the previous summary (1).
Viral Surveillance
World Health Organization (WHO) and National 
Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) 
laboratories include both public health and clinical laborato-
ries throughout the United States and contribute to virologic 
surveillance for influenza. Clinical laboratories test respiratory 
specimens for diagnostic purposes, whereas public health 
laboratories primarily test specimens for surveillance purposes. 
Because of differences in these testing practices, virologic data 
for clinical and public health laboratories is being presented 
separately beginning with the 2015–16 influenza season.
During October 4, 2015–February 6, 2016, clinical laborato-
ries in the United States tested 279,056 respiratory specimens for 
influenza viruses, of which 7,966 (2.9%) were positive (Figure 1). 
During the week ending February 6 (week 5), 17,175 specimens 
were tested, of which 1,563 (9.1%) were positive for influenza. 
Among these, 1,135 (73%) were positive for influenza A viruses 
and 428 (27%) were positive for influenza B viruses.
Public health laboratories tested 26,287 respiratory specimens 
for influenza during October 4, 2015–February 6, 2016. Of the 
3,529 specimens that were positive for influenza, 2,664 (75%) 
were positive for influenza A viruses and 865 (25%) were positive 
for influenza B viruses. Among the 2,536 (95%) influenza A 
viruses subtyped, 1,698 (67%) were influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 
and 838 (33%) were influenza A (H3N2) viruses. Among the 
influenza B viruses, 495 (57%) had lineage determined: 372 
(75%) belonged to the B/Yamagata lineage, and 123 (25%) 
belonged to the B/Victoria lineage. Since October 4, 2015, 
influenza-positive tests have been reported from all 50 states, 
the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, representing all U.S. 
Department of Health and Human Services regions.†
Since October 4, age has been reported for 3,059 patients 
with influenza-positive tests (87%), including 387 (13%) 
children aged 0–4 years, 958 (31%) persons aged 5–24 years, 
1,294 (42%) persons aged 25–64 years, and 420 (14%) persons 
aged ≥65 years. Cumulatively, influenza A (H3N2) viruses 
were predominant among persons aged ≥65 years, whereas 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses predominated among 
other age groups. During January 3, 2016–February 6, 2016, 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses have been the predominant 
viruses detected among all age groups. The greatest number of 
influenza B viruses were reported in persons aged 5–24 years.
Novel Influenza A Viruses
One human infection with a novel influenza A virus was 
reported to CDC during the week ending January 2, 2016, 
(week 52) from the state of New Jersey. The patient was infected 
with an influenza A (H3N2) variant§ (H3N2v) virus. The 
* The CDC influenza surveillance system collects five categories of information 
from nine data sources: 1) viral surveillance (U.S. World Health Organization 
collaborating laboratories, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance 
System, and novel influenza A virus case reporting); 2) outpatient illness 
surveillance (U.S. Outpatient Influenza-Like Illness Surveillance Network); 
3) mortality (the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance 
System, 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System, and influenza-associated pediatric 
mortality reports); 4) hospitalizations (FluSurv-NET, which includes the Emerging 
Infections Program and surveillance in three additional states); and 5) summary 
of the geographic spread of influenza (state and territorial epidemiologist reports).

§ Influenza viruses that circulate in swine are called swine influenza viruses when 
isolated from swine, but are called variant influenza viruses when isolated from 
humans. Seasonal influenza viruses that circulate worldwide in human 
populations have important antigenic and genetic differences from influenza 
viruses circulating in swine.

the week before symptom onset had visited a farm where swine 
were present. The patient was not hospitalized and fully recov-
ered. There was no evidence of human-to-human transmission.
Antigenic and Genetic 
Characterization of Influenza Viruses
The 93 public health laboratories participat-
ing as WHO collaborating laboratories in the 
United States are requested to submit a subset 
of their influenza virus-positive respiratory 
specimens to CDC for further characterization. 
CDC characterizes influenza viruses through 
one or more laboratory tests including genome 
sequencing, hemagglutination inhibition (HI), 
or neutralization assays. These data are used to 
monitor circulating influenza viruses for early 
identification of viruses that are antigenically 
different from the recommended influenza vac-
cine reference viruses. Most viruses analyzed are 
propagated in mammalian cell cultures because 
viruses propagated in tissue culture better rep-
resent viruses in circulation, and isolation rates 
of human influenza viruses are higher in mam-
malian cell cultures than in eggs, which is the 
matrix used for production of the majority of 
influenza vaccines (2,3). In addition, viruses are 
more likely to undergo adaptive changes when 
propagated in eggs. Antigenic and genetic char-
acterization of circulating viruses is performed 
using both mammalian cell- and egg-propagated 
reference viruses.
Data obtained from antigenic characteriza-
tion continue to play an important role in the 
assessment of the similarity between reference 
viruses and circulating viruses. Although vaccine 
effectiveness field studies must be conducted to 
determine how well the vaccine is working, these 
laboratory data are used to evaluate whether 
changes in the virus that could affect vaccine 
effectiveness might have occurred. Beginning 
with the 2014–15 season, a proportion of influ-
enza A (H3N2) viruses have not yielded sufficient 
hemagglutination titers for antigenic character-
ization by HI. For nearly all viruses characterized 
at CDC laboratories, next generation sequencing 
is performed to determine the genetic identity of 
circulating viruses. For the subset of viruses that 
do not yield sufficient hemagglutination titers, 
antigenic properties are inferred using results 
obtained from viruses within the same genetic 
group as those that have been characterized antigenically.
Since October 1, 2015, CDC has antigenically or genet-
ically characterized 483 viruses from the United States

(180 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, 216 influenza A (H3N2), 52 
influenza B/Yamagata lineage, and 35 influenza B/Victoria lin-
eage). All 180 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigeni-
cally characterized as A/California/7/2009-like, the influenza A 
(H1N1) component of 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccines. 
Although all recent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses belong to 
hemagglutinin (HA) genetic group 6B, two genetic subgroups 
have emerged. To date, however, both genetic subgroups remain 
antigenically similar to the A/California/7/2009 virus. All 216 
influenza A (H3N2) viruses were sequenced and belonged to 
genetic groups for which a majority of viruses antigenically char-
acterized were antigenically like¶ A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, 
the influenza A (H3N2) reference virus representing the A(H3N2) 
component of the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccine. A 
subset of 105 influenza A (H3N2) viruses also were antigenically 
characterized; 98 of 105 (93%) influenza A (H3N2) viruses 
were A/Switzerland/9715293/2013-like by HI or neutraliza-
tion testing. All 52 of the B/Yamagata-lineage were antigenically 
characterized as B/Phuket/3073/2013-like, the influenza B 
component of the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere trivalent and 
quadrivalent influenza vaccines. All 35 influenza B viruses belong-
ing to the B/Victoria-lineage were antigenically characterized 
as B/Brisbane/60/2008-like, an influenza B component of the 
2015–16 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent influenza vaccines.
Antiviral Resistance of Influenza Viruses
Since October 4, 2015, a total of 699 influenza viruses (301 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 246 influenza A (H3N2) 
viruses, and 152 influenza B viruses) have been examined for 
antiviral resistance by the WHO Collaborating Center for 
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and Control of Influenza at CDC. 
All 152 influenza B viruses and 246 influenza A (H3N2) viruses 
tested were sensitive to oseltamivir and peramivir. Among 301 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested for resistance, two 
(0.7%) were found to be resistant to both oseltamivir and pera-
mivir. All 301 influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 viruses tested were 
sensitive to zanamivir. High levels of resistance to the adaman-
tanes (amantadine and rimantadine) persist among influenza A 
(H1N1)pdm09 and (H3N2) viruses. Adamantane drugs are not 
recommended for use against influenza at this time.
Outpatient Illness Surveillance
Since October 4, 2015, the weekly percentage of outpatient 
visits for influenza-like illness (ILI)** reported by approximately 
2,000 U.S. Outpatient ILI Surveillance Network (ILINet) pro-
viders in 50 states, New York City, Chicago, the U.S. Virgin 
Islands, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia that con-
stitute ILINet has ranged from 1.3%–2.5%. The percentage 
exceeded the national baseline†† of 2.1% for 2 consecutive 
weeks, from the week ending December 26, 2015–January 2, 
2016 (weeks 51 and 52) (Figure 2). The increase in percent-
age of patient visits for ILI during those 2 weeks might be 
influenced in part by a reduction in routine health care visits 
during the winter holiday season, as has occurred during pre-
vious influenza seasons. The percentage was at or above the 
national baseline for 4 consecutive weeks, from the week ending 
January 16, 2016–February 6, 2016 (weeks 2–5). During the 
1997–1998 through 2014–15 influenza seasons, excluding the 
2009 pandemic, peak weekly percentages of outpatient visits 
for ILI ranged from 2.4%–7.7% and remained above baseline 
levels for an average of 13 weeks (range = 1–19 weeks). For 
the week ending February 6, 2016 (week 5), the percentage of 
outpatient visits for ILI was 2.4%, and seven U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services regions (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10) 
reported ILI activity at or above region-specific baseline levels.
Data collected in ILINet are used to produce a measure of ILI 
activity§§ by jurisdiction. During the week ending February 6, 
2016 (week 5), Puerto Rico and one state (Arizona) experienced 
high ILI activity. Two states (Arkansas and Connecticut) expe-
rienced moderate ILI activity. New York City and eight states 
(Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oklahoma, 
Oregon, Texas, and Utah) experienced low ILI activity. Minimal 
ILI activity was experienced in 38 states (Alabama, Alaska, 
California, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, 
Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, 
Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, 
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, North 
Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, 
South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West 
Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming). The District of Columbia 
and one state (Colorado) had insufficient data to report.
 ¶ A virus is considered “reference virus-like” if its hemagglutination inhibition (HI) 
or neutralization focus reduction (FRA) titer is within 4-fold of the homologous 
HI/FRA titer of the reference strain. A virus is considered as low to the reference 
virus if there is ≥8-fold or greater reduction in the HI or FRA titer when compared 
with the homologous HI or FRA titer of the reference strain.
 
** Defined as a fever ≥100°F (≥37.8°C), oral or equivalent, and cough and/or 
sore throat, without a known cause other than influenza.
 
†† The national and regional baselines are the mean percentage of visits for ILI 
during noninfluenza weeks for the previous three seasons plus two standard 
deviations. Noninfluenza weeks are defined as periods of ≥2 consecutive weeks 
in which each week accounted for <2% of the season’s total number of 
specimens that tested positive for influenza. National and regional percentages 
of patient visits for ILI are weighted on the basis of state population. Use of 
the national baseline for regional data is not appropriate.
 
§§ Activity levels are based on the percentage of outpatient visits in a jurisdiction 
attributed to ILI and are compared with the average percentage of ILI visits 
that occur during weeks with little or no influenza virus circulation. Activity 
levels range from minimal, corresponding to ILI activity from outpatient 
clinics at or below the average, to high, corresponding to ILI activity from 
outpatient clinics much higher than the average. Because the clinical definition 
of ILI is nonspecific, not all ILI is caused by influenza; however, when 
combined with laboratory data, the information on ILI activity provides a 
clearer picture of influenza activity in the United States.

widespread activity during each season has ranged from 20 in 
the 2011–12 season to 49 in the 2010–11 season.
Influenza-Associated Hospitalizations
CDC monitors hospitalizations associated with laboratory-
confirmed influenza infection in adults and children through 
the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Network (FluSurv-
NET),*** which covers approximately 27 million persons, 9% 
of the U.S. population. During October 4, 2015–February 6, 
2016, a total of 896 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated 
hospitalizations were reported, with a cumulative incidence 
for all age groups of 3.2 per 100,000. Persons aged ≥65 years 
had the highest rate of influenza-associated hospitalization and 
accounted for approximately 40% of reported influenza-associ-
ated hospitalizations. The cumulative hospitalizations rate (per 
100,000 population) during October 4, 2015–February 6, 2016, 
was 4.5 among children aged <5 years, 1.1 among children and 
adolescents aged 5–17 years, 1.5 among adults aged 18–49 years, 
4.1 among adults aged 50–64 years and 10.2 among adults aged 
≥65 years. During the past three influenza seasons (2012–13 
through 2014–15), end-of-season age-specific cumulative 
hospitalization rates have ranged from 47.3–67.0 per 100,000 
population for persons aged 0–4 years, 9.4–16.6 for persons aged 
5–17 years, 16.1–21.4 for persons aged 18–49 years, 40.9–53.7 
for persons aged 50–64 years, and 84.7–308.5 for persons aged 
≥65 years. Among all hospitalizations reported during October 4, 
2015–February 6, 2016, a total of 624 (70%) were associated 
with influenza A, 242 (27%) with influenza B, 20 (2.2%) with 
influenza A and B co-infection, and 10 (1.1%) had no virus 
type information. Among 189 patients with influenza A subtype 
information, 160 (85%) were A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and 29 
(15%) were A(H3N2) virus.
Complete medical chart abstraction data were available for 
349 (39%) hospitalized patients with laboratory-confirmed 
influenza as of February 6, 2016. Among these, 91% of hos-
pitalized adults had at least one underlying medical condition 
that placed them at high risk for influenza-associated compli-
cations.††† The most commonly reported medical conditions 
were cardiovascular disease (39%), metabolic disorders (38%), 
and obesity (36%). Forty seven percent of hospitalized children 
had at least one underlying medical condition, the most com-
monly reported being asthma (19%) and neurologic disorders 
(17%). Among 29 hospitalized women of childbearing age 
(15–44 years), 7 (24%) were pregnant.
Pneumonia and Influenza-Associated Mortality
Pneumonia and influenza (P&I)-associated deaths are 
tracked through two systems, the National Center for Health 
Statistics (NCHS) Mortality Surveillance System, which 
reports the week the death occurred, and the 122 Cities 
Mortality Reporting System, which reports the week that the 
death certificate was registered. Because of these differences in 
reporting, the two data sources produce different percentages. 
Beginning with the 2015–16 influenza season, the NCHS 
Mortality Surveillance System has been the principal compo-
nent of U.S. Mortality Surveillance System.
For the week ending January 23, 2016 (week 3), 6.9% 
(1,861 of 27,158) of all U.S. deaths were classified as resulting 
from P&I as reported by NCHS (Figure 3). This percentage 
is below the epidemic threshold of 7.6% for week 3.§§§ Since 
October 4, 2015 the percentage of deaths attributable to P&I 
ranged from 6.2% to 7.2% and has not exceeded the epidemic 
 *** FluSurv-NET conducts population-based surveillance for laboratory-
confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations in children and adolescents 
aged <18 years (since the 2003–04 influenza season) and adults aged ≥18 years 
(since the 2005–06 influenza season). The FluSurv-NET covers approximately 
70 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program states (California, 
Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, New 
York, Oregon, and Tennessee) and additional Influenza Hospitalization 
Surveillance Project (IHSP) states. IHSP began during the 2009–10 season 
to enhance surveillance during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. IHSP sites 
included Iowa, Idaho, Michigan, Oklahoma, and South Dakota during the 
2009–10 season; Idaho, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and 
Utah during the 2010–11 season; Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah 
during the 2011–12 season; and Iowa, Michigan, Ohio, Rhode Island, and 
Utah during the 2012–13 season; and Michigan, Ohio, and Utah during the 
2013–14, 2014–15, and 2015–16 seasons. Cumulative unadjusted incidence 
rates are calculated using CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics 
population estimates for the counties included in the surveillance catchment 
area. Laboratory confirmation is dependent on clinician-ordered influenza 
testing, and testing for influenza often is underutilized because of the poor 
reliability of rapid test results and greater reliance on clinical diagnosis for 
influenza. As a consequence, cases identified as part of influenza hospitalization 
surveillance likely are an underestimation of the actual number of persons 
hospitalized with influenza.
 ††† Persons at higher risk include children aged <5 years (especially those aged 
<2 years); adults aged ≥65 years; persons with chronic pulmonary (including 
asthma), cardiovascular (except hypertension alone), renal, hepatic, hematologic 
(including sickle cell disease), metabolic disorders (including diabetes mellitus), 
or neurologic and neurodevelopment conditions (including disorders of the 
brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle, such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy 
[seizure disorders], stroke, intellectual disability [mental retardation], moderate 
to severe developmental delay, muscular dystrophy, or spinal cord injury); 
persons with immunosuppression, including that caused by medications or 
by human immunodeficiency virus infection; women who are pregnant or 
postpartum (within 2 weeks after delivery); persons aged ≤18 years who are 
receiving long-term aspirin therapy; American Indians/Alaska Natives; persons 
who are morbidly obese (i.e., body mass index ≥40); and residents of nursing 
homes and other chronic care facilities.
 
§§§ The seasonal baseline proportion of P&I deaths is projected using a robust 
regression procedure, in which a periodic regression model is applied to the 
observed percentage of deaths from P&I that were reported by the National 
Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System and the 122 Cities 
Mortality Reporting System during the preceding 5 years. The epidemic 
threshold is set at 1.645 standard deviations above the seasonal baseline. 
Users of the data should not expect the NCHS mortality surveillance data 
and the 122 Cities Mortality Reporting System to produce the same 
percentages, and the percent P&I deaths from each system should be 
compared with the corresponding system specific baselines and thresholds.

peak weekly percentages of deaths attributable to P&I have 
ranged from 8.7% during the 2011–12 season to 11.1% dur-
ing the 2012–13 season.
Since October 4, 2015, the weekly percentage of deaths

Influenza-Associated Pediatric Mortality
As of February 6, 2016 (week 5), 11 influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths that occurred during the 2015–16 season have 
been reported to CDC. Of these, one death was associated with 
an influenza A (H3N2) virus, three were associated with an 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, three were associated with 
an influenza A virus for which no subtyping was performed, 
and four were associated with an influenza B virus. Since 
influenza-associated pediatric mortality became nationally 
notifiable in 2004, the total number of influenza-associated 
pediatric deaths has ranged from 37–171 per season, excluding 
the 2009 pandemic, during which 358 pediatric deaths were 
reported to CDC during April 15, 2009–October 2, 2010.

Discussion
Timing of influenza activity in the United States can be vari-
able but most often peaks during January–March (4). During 
the three most recent influenza seasons, 2012–13, 2013–14, 
and 2014–15, activity began relatively early, and peaked in late 
December and early January. The current season activity began 
to increase in mid-December, a more typical influenza activity 
pattern. Activity has continued to increase through February 6, 
2016. It is not possible to predict when influenza activity will 
peak but influenza activity will likely continue to increase 
and remain elevated for several weeks. Influenza A (H3N2), 
influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, and influenza B viruses have 
cocirculated this season. During the weeks ending October 10, 
2015–December 5, 2015 (weeks 40 through 48), influenza A 
(H3N2) was the most common virus identified. However, begin-
ning with week 49, influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 has been the 
most common. CDC has received reports of severe respiratory 
illness among young- to middle-aged adults with influenza A 
(H1N1)pdm09 (5). This has also been observed during previous 
seasons when influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 predominated (6).
Although vaccine effectiveness estimates are not yet available 
for the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccine, laboratory data 
to date have indicated similarity between circulating viruses 
and recommended vaccine components. Vaccination remains 
the best way to prevent influenza infection and associated 
complications (4). Health care providers should continue to 
offer and encourage vaccination for unvaccinated persons aged 
≥6 months throughout the influenza season.
Although influenza vaccination is the best way to prevent 
influenza, antiviral medications are an important adjunct 
for reducing the health impact of influenza. Treatment with 
influenza antiviral medications as early as possible is recom-
mended for patients with confirmed or suspected influenza 
who have severe, complicated, or progressive illness; who 
require hospitalization; or who are at high risk for influenza-
related complications (7,8). Antiviral treatment should not be 
withheld from high-risk or severely ill patients with suspected 
influenza infection pending confirmatory influenza text results 
or based on illness onset (7). Treatment is most effective when 
given early in the illness; providers should not delay treatment 
while waiting for test results and should not rely on insensitive 
assays such as rapid antigen detection influenza diagnostic tests 
to determine treatment (7,8).
Influenza surveillance reports for the United States are posted 
online weekly (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly). Additional 
information regarding influenza viruses, influenza surveillance, 
influenza vaccine, influenza antiviral medications, and novel influ-
enza A infections in humans is online (http://www.cdc.gov/flu).

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
CDC collects, compiles, and analyzes data on influenza activity 
year-round in the United States. Timing of influenza activity and 
predominant circulating influenza viruses vary by season.
What is added by this report?
Influenza activity remained low in the United States through early 
December and began to increase slowly in mid-December. Influenza A 
and B viruses have been reported. Influenza A (H3N2) viruses 
predominated from October to mid-December, and influenza A 
(H1N1)pdm09 viruses have predominated from mid-December to 
February. To date, the majority of influenza viruses that have been 
antigenically or genetically characterized are similar to components of 
the 2015–16 Northern Hemisphere vaccine.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Vaccination is the primary method to prevent influenza illness 
and its complications. Health care providers should continue to 
recommend influenza vaccination to all unvaccinated persons 
aged ≥6 months now and throughout the influenza season. As 
an adjunct to vaccine, treatment with influenza antiviral 
medications is recommended for patients with confirmed or 
suspected influenza who have severe, complicated, or progres-
sive illness; who require hospitalization; or who are at high risk 
for influenza-related complications. Antivirals can lessen 
severity and duration of illness and can reduce severe outcomes 
of influenza. Antiviral medications work best when adminis-
tered early in the course of influenza-like illness.
