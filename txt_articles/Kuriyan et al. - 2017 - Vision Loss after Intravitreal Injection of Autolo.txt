Summary
Adipose tissue–derived “stem cells” have been increasingly used by “stem-cell clinics” in the 
United States and elsewhere to treat a variety of disorders. We evaluated three patients in whom 
severe bilateral visual loss developed after they received intravitreal injections of autologous 
adipose tissue–derived “stem cells” at one such clinic in the United States. In these three patients, 
the last documented visual acuity on the Snellen eye chart before the injection ranged from 20/30 
to 20/200. The patients’ severe visual loss after the injection was associated with ocular 
hypertension, hemorrhagic retinopathy, vitreous hemorrhage, combined traction and 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, or lens dislocation. After 1 year, the patients’ visual acuity 
ranged from 20/200 to no light perception.
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of vision loss in persons older 
than 75 years of age in the United States.1 Progressive dysfunction and loss of retinal 
pigment epithelium cells and photoreceptors lead to poor visual acuity in patients with non-
neovascular AMD.2 The potential role of delivering subretinal human retinal pigment 
epithelium, photoreceptor cells, or both, differentiated from pluripotent stem cells, to replace 
the damaged cells in patients with non-neovascular AMD is being investigated in several 
clinical trials registered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and approved by 
institutional review boards.3 As of November 2, 2016, at least 13 trials of intravitreal 
injections of various stem-cell populations were registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Of these, 4 
were based in the United States and 3 were recruiting. One trial (ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT01736059)4 focused on intravitreal injection of CD34+ bone marrow–derived stem 
cells isolated with the use of Good Manufacturing Practices. A second trial (NCT02320812)

 involves retinal progenitor cells tested in patients with retinitis pigmentosa. A third trial 
(NCT01920867)5,6 involves bone marrow–derived stem cells delivered through up to six 
different routes of administration for a broad swath of ocular diseases, including non-
neovascular AMD. A fourth trial (NCT02024269), which was withdrawn on September 15, 
2015, before enrollment had begun, focused on the use of intravitreal autologous adipose 
tissue–derived stem cells in patients with non-neovascular AMD.
Adipose tissue–derived “stem cells” have been increasingly used by “stem-cell clinics” 
because of the ease of obtaining and preparing these cells. Many of the clinics that provide 
these stem-cell therapies have done so under the auspices of patient-funded, institutional 
review board–approved research, and the research is listed on ClinicalTrials.gov without an 
investigational new drug application with the FDA.7–10 We report three cases of vision loss 
after patients with AMD received bilateral intravitreal injections of autologous adipose 
tissue–derived stem cells at a stem-cell clinic, which was the study site for the fourth trial 
described above (NCT02024269). After treatment, in June 2015, the patients were referred 
to two university-based ophthalmology practices. The funding organizations had no role in 
the design or conduct of the current study.
Stem-Cell Procedure
According to the documentation that we obtained, the procedure was carried out in the 
patients as follows. An adipose-rich periumbilical area was injected subcutaneously with an 
anesthetic solution to prepare for tumescent liposuction. Fifteen to 20 minutes later, 
additional local anesthetic was injected, followed by a 60-ml liposuction aspiration, and the 
sample of adipose tissue was processed to isolate the putative stem cells.
In parallel, standard phlebotomy was performed to collect 35 ml of whole blood, which was 
centrifuged to separate a platelet-rich plasma fraction. The liposuction aspirate was washed 
in 60 ml of cell-wash solution with gentle agitation for 2 to 4 minutes, after which the 
aqueous fraction was removed and the cells underwent enzyme treatment for 12 minutes at 
37°C, with 30 seconds of vigorous shaking every 6 minutes. After dissociation, the cells 
were centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 5 minutes, creating a pellet of stromal vascular cells. These 
cells were resuspended, washed in cell-wash solution, and centrifuged again.
The pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 to 6 ml of platelet-rich plasma and used 
immediately for intravitreal injection into both eyes as described below. Patients were 
instructed to use one drop of topical moxifloxacin three times per day for 3 days in both 
eyes, to limit activity (swimming, heavy lifting, exercise, and application of eye makeup) for 
3 days, and to keep their eyes dry for 3 days.
Case Reports
Patient 1
A 72-year-old woman with a history of non-neovascular AMD and a best-corrected Snellen 
visual acuity of 20/60 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye underwent bilateral 
intravitreal injection of autologous adipose tissue–derived stem cells for the treatment of

 non-neovascular AMD. The patient underwent the procedure at a stem-cell clinic that had an 
institutional review board–approved research trial (NCT02024269) listed on 
ClinicalTrials.gov at the time; however, the written information provided to the patient did 
not mention participation in a clinical trial, review or approval by an institutional review 
board, or an association with a trial listed on ClinicalTrials.gov.
The patient reported that she had found the stem-cell clinic through its listing on Clinical-
Trials.gov. She also reported that she was under the impression that she was participating in 
a clinical trial and that she had met the criteria of the trial. She paid $5,000 for the bilateral 
procedure. The consent form indicated the risk of blindness.
The patient presented to the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute in Miami 3 days after the 
intravitreal injection. On presentation, her visual acuity was perception of hand motion in 
both eyes, and the intraocular pressure was 66 mm Hg in the right eye and 59 mm Hg in the 
left eye. Examination of the anterior segment showed conjunctival injection, corneal 
microcystic edema, fixed, middilated pupils, and peripheral iridocorneal touch in both eyes. 
The nuclear sclerotic cataract was anteriorly displaced in both eyes, as shown by high-
resolution ultrasonography (Fig. 1A). The patient had a dense vitreous hemorrhage in both 
eyes, which obscured the view of the posterior pole. Posterior segment ultrasonography 
showed mildly to moderately dense, mobile, vitreous opacities with macular thickening in 
both eyes and possible retinal detachment and vitreoretinal adhesions in the left eye (Fig. 
1B).
Because of the anterior displacement of the crystalline lens and elevated intraocular pressure 
in both eyes, bilateral pars plana vitrectomies and lensectomies were performed. Histologic 
examination showed histiocytes and no malignant cells. After removal of the dense vitreous 
hemorrhage, diffuse intraretinal hemorrhage was identified in both eyes (Fig. 1C). A 
localized rhegmatogenous retinal detachment that was identified in the right eye was 
managed with endolaser barricade of the tear and silicone oil tamponade. Silicone oil 
tamponade was chosen for tamponade in all patients during repair of retinal detachment 
because it facilitates visual rehabilitation and travel better than does air or gas tamponade, 
which greatly limits vision and precludes flight in commercial aircraft. Postoperative optical 
coherence tomography (OCT) revealed retinal thickening without cystoid macular edema in 
the right eye (Fig. 1D). Fluorescein angiography of the right eye showed blockage from the 
hemorrhages and a temporal macula window defect, but it did not show changes consistent 
with vasculitis (Fig. 1E). OCT and fluorescein angiography could not be performed in the 
left eye because of corneal edema.
Over time, both of the patient’s retinas became markedly atrophic. One year after the 
vitrectomies and lensectomies, her right retina was detached, with severe proliferative 
vitreoretinopathy, and she had no light perception in both eyes because of atrophy. Her 
intraocular pressure was controlled with topical medications for glaucoma.
Patient 2
Quiescent neovascular AMD was diagnosed in a 78-year-old woman with a best-corrected 
Snellen visual acuity of 20/50 in the right eye and 20/100 in the left eye after she received

 bilateral injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs in both eyes 
over the course of 2 years and before she received bilateral intravitreal injections of 
autologous adipose tissue– derived stem cells at the same stem-cell clinic mentioned 
previously. Like Patient 1, she was aware of the clinical trial posted on ClinicalTrials.gov by 
the stem-cell clinic. She also paid $5,000 for the same procedure that Patient 1 had 
undergone.
Approximately 2 days after Patient 2 received bilateral intravitreal injections, she presented 
to both the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute and to the Center for Sight in Sarasota, Florida. On 
presentation, her visual acuity was such that she could count fingers with both eyes, and the 
intraocular pressure was 13 mm Hg in both eyes. Examination of the anterior segment of 
each eye showed conjunctival injection and grade 1+ anterior chamber cells in both eyes. 
The patient had bilateral vitreous hemorrhages and diffuse intraretinal and preretinal 
hemorrhages (Fig. 2A). OCT showed an epiretinal membrane with fundus thickening 
without cystoid macular edema in the right eye and geographic atrophy and fundus 
thickening without cystoid macular edema in the left eye (Fig. 2B). Fluorescein angiography 
showed blockage from the hemorrhages, but it did not show vasculitis (Fig. 2C). She 
underwent serial observation, but 16 days after the injection, a combined tractional and 
rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy developed in the 
right eye and was treated with scleral buckle, pars plana vitrectomy, membrane peel, and 
silicone oil tamponade. Consistent with zonular weakness, there was anterior dislocation of 
the patient’s intraocular lens and lens capsule during the fluid–air exchange intraoperatively.
Thirty-eight days after the patient received the bilateral intravitreal injections, a combined 
tractional and rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy 
developed in the left eye, which was treated with pars plana vitrectomy and silicone oil. 
Postoperatively, the patient’s retinas were attached after 1 year (Fig. 2D), and her vision was 
perception of hand motion in the right eye and 20/200 in the left eye.
Patient 3
An 88-year-old woman with a visual acuity of 20/40 in the right eye and 20/200 in the left 
eye had a history of non-neovascular AMD with bilateral geographic atrophy and a retinal 
tear treated with cryopexy in the left eye 30 years before she received bilateral intravitreal 
stem-cell injections, as described in Patients 1 and 2. Patient 3 received injections at the 
same stem-cell clinic for $5,000.
Patient 3 presented 1 week after the procedure to the Dean McGee Eye Institute, Oklahoma 
City. On presentation, the patient’s visual acuity was light perception in the right eye and 
20/200 in the left eye, and her intraocular pressure was 12 mm Hg in the right eye and 16 
mm Hg in the left eye. She had an afferent pupillary defect in the right eye. Examination of 
the anterior segment of each eye was clinically significant for pseudophakia in both eyes. 
The patient had a total retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy in the right eye 
and geographic atrophy with a superotemporal cryopexy scar in the left eye (Fig. 2E). OCT 
imaging of the left eye showed geographic atrophy (Fig. 2F). OCT imaging of the right eye 
was not performed.

 The patient’s right eye was managed with a scleral buckle, pars plana vitrectomy, membrane 
peel, peripheral localized retinectomy, and silicone oil tamponade. Four weeks after the 
injection, a total retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy developed in the 
patient’s left eye. Of note, during the intraoperative fluid–air exchange, there was anterior 
dislocation of the patient’s intraocular lens and lens capsule in both eyes consistent with 
zonular weakness. One year after surgery, the patient’s retinas were attached, and her visual 
acuity was perception of hand motion in the right eye and light perception in the left.
Discussion
Here we describe a consecutive case series of serious adverse events associated with 
intravitreal stem-cell injections performed in the United States. Blinding visual outcomes 
occurred in three patients after they received bilateral intravitreal injection of autologous 
adipose tissue–derived stem cells at the same stem-cell clinic (Table 1). These 1-year 
outcomes are dramatically worse than the typical 1-year visual-loss outcomes that have been 
reported with the use of vitamin supplementation for non-neovascular AMD, which has been 
associated with a moderate visual loss in 3.3% of patients,11 and the 1-year outcomes that 
have been reported with the use of anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular AMD, which has 
been associated with a moderate visual loss in less than 5% of patients.12
Although numerous stem-cell therapies for medical disorders are being investigated at 
research institutions with appropriate regulatory oversight, many stem-cell clinics are 
treating patients with little oversight and with no proof of efficacy.10 A distinction has been 
made between clinical studies of stem-cell therapies that are founded on solid preclinical 
research with strong scientific design and programs that lack preclinical research 
justification. These programs are often funded by patients at nonacademic centers,8 and they 
may not receive FDA oversight if these procedures are performed without the filing of an 
investigational new drug application with the FDA, which requires extensive safety data. At 
least one of the patients thought the procedure was performed within the context of a clinical 
trial (NCT02024269). However, the consent forms signed by all three patients do not 
mention a clinical trial. The patients paid for a procedure that had never been studied in a 
clinical trial, lacked sufficient safety data, and was performed in both eyes on the same day. 
Experimental bilateral intravitreal injections are both atypical and unsafe.
In patients with non-neovascular AMD, stem cells have been investigated as a way to 
replace the diseased retinal pigment epithelium, photoreceptors in the macula, or both. 
Previous studies have shown that suspensions of autologous retinal pigment epithelium cells 
were limited in their ability to recreate a monolayer on the diseased Bruch’s membrane in 
patients with nonneovascular AMD.13 Moreover, although suspensions of human embryonic 
stem cell–derived retinal pigment epithelium that have been injected under the retina in 
patients with non-neovascular AMD have been shown to have a good safety profile, they 
have limited benefit with respect to visual acuity in patients with geographic atrophy.14 In 
addition, there is sparse evidence that cultures of mesenchymal or adipose-derived stem cells 
can differentiate into retinal pigment epithelium or photoreceptors.15,16

 Since ophthalmologists have administered millions of intravitreal injections of other 
medications for various retinal diseases without similar complications, the complications 
seen in the three patients described in this series are probably due to the stem-cell 
preparations rather than to the injection procedure. If the eyes had been injected with 
excessive volume, then we would expect elevation of the intraocular pressure, pain, and 
transient loss of vision due to ischemia of the retina or optic nerve. However, retinal 
detachments with severe proliferative vitreoretinopathy developed in all six eyes in this 
series while the patients were undergoing observation after the injection.
Since pluripotent stem cells injected into the vitreous may undergo transformation to 
myofibroblast-like cells, it is possible that the injected cells transformed into myofibroblasts. 
If this is the case, like retinal pigment epithelium cells that may be present on the surface of 
the retina after rhegmatogenous retinal detachments, they may have caused proliferative 
vitreoretinopathy and retinal detachment.17 Retinal detachment rates of 29% in a phase 1 
trial and 15% in a phase 1–2a trial of subretinal human umbilical tissue–derived cells have 
been reported.18,19 In contrast, the rate of retinal detachment after intravitreal injection of 
anti-VEGF is 0 to 0.67%.20
All three patients in this series also had profound zonular weakness, which can occur when 
enzymes such as trypsin are used in the preparation of the stem cells and contaminate the 
injections.21 In addition to the vision loss related to intraocular pressure and retinal 
detachment, vision loss may have developed because of a combination of factors, including 
toxic effects on the retina or optic nerve caused by the injected material, which may have 
included the enzymes used in the preparation. The loss of vision in Patient 1 is most likely 
due to optic-nerve atrophy caused by prolonged elevated intraocular pressure, since rapid 
progression to no light perception developed when her retina was attached in both eyes.
The outcome of poor visual acuity in these three patients arouses concern about the 
performance of procedures at stem-cell clinics that charge patients for their services and that 
lack clinical or preclinical data to support their practices. Many stem-cell clinics have 
claimed that autologous stem-cell injections do not fall under the auspices of FDA 
regulations.7–10 Our case reports establish the possibility of devastating outcomes from such 
procedures. Other case reports have shown a lack of efficacy in cases of medical tourism in 
which nothing was injected into the patient’s eye.8 The need for oversight of such clinics 
and for the education of patients by physicians and regulatory bodies is paramount to 
protecting patients while advancing proper research and innovation.22–24
