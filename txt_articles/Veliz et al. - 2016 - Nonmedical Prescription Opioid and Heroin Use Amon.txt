abstract
OBJECTIVES: Previous research has found that adolescent athletes may be at increased risk of 
nonmedical prescription opioid use (NPOU) due to injuries. Although adolescent athletes 
are at an increased risk of engaging in NPOU, it has yet to be determined if they are also at 
greater risk for heroin use. The major purpose of this study was to examine both the trends 
in prevalence rates and patterns of initiation in lifetime NPOU and lifetime heroin use 
among adolescents who engage in sports and exercise.
METHODS: Eighteen cross-sections of eighth and 10th graders were used from the Monitoring 
the Future study. The sample consisted of 191 682 respondents who answered questions 
on past-year participation in sports and exercise, lifetime NPOU, lifetime heroin use, age of 
NPOU onset, and age of heroin onset.
RESULTS: The trends in NPOU and lifetime heroin use among adolescents who engage in 
sports and exercise has declined between 1997 and 2014. Logistic regression analyses 
found that adolescents who engage in sports and exercise had lower odds of reporting 
lifetime NPOU and heroin use compared with adolescents who did not engage in these 
activities during the past year. Analyses among lifetime heroin users found that adolescents 
who engage in sports and exercise had lower odds of initiating NPOU before heroin when 
compared with their peers who did not engage in these activities in the past year.
CONCLUSIONS: Daily participation in sports and exercise may serve as a protective factor with 
respect to NPOU and heroin use.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Research has 
found that athletes are at risk for nonmedical 
prescription opioid use (NPOU) due to injuries. 
Although athletes are at risk for engaging in NPOU, 
it has not been determined whether they are at risk 
for heroin use.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Although athletes have 
been found to be at risk for NPOU, the majority of 
adolescents who engage in sports are less likely to 
report NPOU and heroin use during a period when 
opioid use has increased in the US.

The prescribing of opioid analgesics 
and nonmedical prescription 
opioid use (NPOU) has increased 
significantly among US children 
and adolescents over the past 2 
decades. 
1 
– 
3 Regional and national 
studies indicate that lifetime 
exposure to prescription opioids 
in medical or nonmedical contexts 
among US high school students 
ranges from 22% to 45%. 
4– 
6 Despite 
the efficacy of opioid analgesics when 
used properly to treat acute pain-
related conditions, there are growing 
public health concerns based on their 
high abuse potential and the elevated 
risk among adolescents to engage in 
heroin use due to increased exposure 
to prescription opioids in medical 
and nonmedical contexts. 
2, 
 
7 
 
– 
11
Although NPOU among adolescents 
has decreased in recent years, 
 
2, 
 
3 
there are concerns that adolescents 
and young adults are moving 
toward heroin because of its greater 
availability and affordability in 
relation to prescription opioids. 
Indeed, the association between 
NPOU and heroin use is robust 
among adolescents and young 
adults. 
9, 
 
12, 
13 For instance, the past-
year heroin incidence rate was 19 
times higher among those who 
reported previous NPOU than among 
those who did not report NPOU. 
9 
Moreover, more than half of past-
year heroin initiates reported NPOU 
before starting heroin, whereas ∼1% 
of past-year NPOU initiates had used 
heroin before starting NPOU. 
9 These 
results indicate that early onset of 
NPOU during adolescence warrants 
closer examination because it may be 
a key precursor to heroin use.
In particular, adolescents who 
participate in athletics may be 
at a greater risk to engage in 
NPOU because of their greater 
risk of injury 
14, 
 
15 or because of 
a greater opportunity to receive 
diverted opioid medications from 
teammates. 
16 Several studies have 
found that youth who are highly 
involved in competitive sports are 
at a greater risk of being prescribed 
opioid medications, misusing 
opioid medications (eg, use to “get 
high”), and being approached to 
divert (eg, give away) these opioid 
medications. 
15, 
16 A national study 
found that youth who participated 
in high-injury sports such as football 
and wrestling were at greater 
risk to misuse prescription pain 
medications. 
14 The greater risk to 
misuse opioid medications may 
be related to the fact that football 
players and wrestlers have the 
highest severe injury rates among 
high school athletes 
17 and may be 
more likely to have been prescribed 
opioid medications by a physician. 
In addition, youth who participate 
in high-injury sports may be 
surrounded by peers who are more 
likely to have leftover prescription 
opioids, making it easier to receive 
diverted prescription opioids to 
ease injuries without having to 
acknowledge to parents and coaches 
that they need medical attention 
(eg, hiding injuries from coaches to 
participate).
Although adolescent athletes may 
be at greater risk of engaging in 
NPOU, it has yet to be determined 
whether they are also at greater 
risk for heroin use. Anecdotal 
evidence from various media 
sources has suggested prescription 
opioids may be turning adolescent 
athletes into heroin addicts. 
18, 
 
19 
These narratives typically describe 
how a young athlete was injured 
through participation in sports, was 
prescribed opioids to manage pain, 
began misusing these medications, 
and eventually turned to heroin 
(because it was easily available or 
cheaper). Although these narratives 
are compelling, there have been 
no large-scale studies to assess 
whether NPOU is actually leading to 
an “epidemic” of heroin users among 
the population of adolescents who 
frequently engage in sports and 
exercise.
To date, the association between 
NPOU and heroin use among 
adolescents who engage in sports 
and exercise has not been examined. 
Moreover, the extent to which 
NPOU may act as a precursor to 
heroin use has not been studied 
in the population of adolescents 
who engage in sports and exercise. 
Given that >75% of the adolescent 
population in the United States 
participates in organized sports, 
 
20 
it is critical to assess whether this 
large population of adolescents 
are more likely to misuse opioid 
analgesics or use heroin. Accordingly, 
this exploratory study seeks to 
examine 3 specific questions by 
using nationally representative data 
among eighth and 10th graders 
from the Monitoring the Future 
(MTF) study between 1997 and 
2014: Have rates of lifetime NPOU 
and heroin use increased among 
adolescents who engage in sports 
and exercise during a period when 
prescribing opioids accelerated 
among the adolescent population? 
Do adolescents who participate in 
sports and exercise have a higher 
risk of lifetime NPOU and heroin use 
compared with other adolescents 
who do not engage in these activities 
when key sociodemographic and 
lifetime substance use behaviors 
are controlled for? Are adolescents 
who engage in sports and exercise 
more likely to have a history of 
NPOU before (or concurrently with) 
initiating heroin use when compared 
with their nonactive peers?
METHODS
The current study used 18 cross-
sections of the MTF study between 
1997 and 2014. 
2 Based on a 3-stage 
sampling procedure, MTF has 
surveyed nationally representative 
samples of ∼15 000 US high school 
seniors each year since 1975 and 
30 000 eighth and 10th graders 
since 1991 via questionnaires 
administered in classrooms. The

response rate among eighth, 10th, 
and 12th graders between 1991 and 
2014 has ranged from 79% to 91%. 
The project design and sampling 
methods are described in greater 
detail elsewhere. 
2
The current study used secondary 
data from eighth and 10th graders 
who were randomly assigned to 
complete Form 2 between 1997 and 
2014. The 1997 school year was 
chosen as the first year to include 
in this study because of changes in 
the eighth and 10th grade forms 
after 1996 (ie, only 2 forms were 
provided between 1991 and 1996, 
whereas 4 forms were provided in 
1997 and beyond). Additionally, 
Form 2 was chosen because it is the 
only form that has questions on both 
involvement in athletics and when 
respondents initiated heroin and 
NPOU. The sample of 12th graders 
provided by the MTF were excluded 
because none of the 5 forms for high 
school seniors has a combination of 
questions about sports or physical 
activity, NPOU, heroin use, and when 
NPOU or heroin use was initiated. 
Given the parameters for the 
sample outlined above, the sample 
includes 191 682 (weighted n = 
191 660) respondents (52% eighth 
graders, 48% 10th graders). The 
demographics for the sample are 
provided in  
Table 1.
Measures
Lifetime opioid or opiate use was 
based on 3 questions that asked 
respondents to report on lifetime 
heroin use with a needle, lifetime 
heroin use without using a needle, 
and lifetime NPOU (ie, used 
“narcotics other than heroin, such 
as methadone, opium, morphine, 
codeine, Demerol, Vicodin, 
OxyContin, and Percocet . . . without 
a doctor telling you to take them”). 
Respondents could select from 7 
response categories that ranged 
from “0 Occasions” to “40 or more 
occasions.” Two binary measures 
were constructed from these

questions that indicated whether 
respondents ever reported heroin 
use during their lifetime (ie, with 
a needle or without a needle) or 
whether respondents ever reported 
NPOU during their lifetime.
History of initiating NPOU in relation 
to initiating heroin was measured 
with 2 separate questions that asked 
the following: “When (if ever) did 
you FIRST do each of the following 
things? Don’t count anything you 
took because a doctor told you 
to. . . . [a] Try heroin. . . . [b] Try a 
narcotic other than heroin (codeine, 
Vicodin, OxyContin, Percocet, 
etc.).” Both questions had response 
categories that ranged from “Grade 
4” to the respondent’s current grade 
level (“Grade 8” or “Grade 10”). 
An additional category was also 
provided for respondents to indicate 
“never.” Both of these questions were 
combined into a mutually exclusive 
variable of the following categories: 
No Lifetime NPOU or Heroin Use, 
Lifetime NPOU Only, Lifetime Heroin 
Use Only, Initiated NPOU and Heroin 
Use in the Same Grade, Initiated 
NPOU in at Least One Grade Before 
Initiating Heroin Use, and Initiated 
Heroin Use in at Least One Grade 
Before Initiating NPOU.
Participation in sports and exercise 
was measured with 1 question 
that asked respondents how often 
they “Actively participate in sports, 
athletics or exercising.” Responses 
included “Never, 
” “A few times a year, 
” 
“Once or twice a month, 
” “At least 
once a week, 
” and “Almost every day.” 
This question was collapsed into 
a mutually exclusive variable that 
included categories for respondents 
who reported not participating in 
sports and exercise in the past year 
(ie, “Never”), respondents who 
reported participating in sports and 
exercise once a week at most (ie, 
“A few times a year, 
” “Once or twice 
a month, 
” “At least once a week”), 
and respondents who reported 
participating in sports and exercise 
almost every day 
(ie, “Almost every day”). It should be 
noted that ∼55% of eighth graders 
and 52% of 10th graders in the study 
sample indicated participating in 
sports and exercise almost every 
day (ie, highly involved athletes). 
Whereas the current measure used 
to assess the extent of participation 
in sports could include adolescents 
who engage only in exercise, with 
no history of participation in sports, 
other measures of the extent of 
past-year involvement in school and 
community sports among eighth and 
10th graders in the MTF have found 
that ∼58% of eighth graders and 
45% of 10th graders participated on 
≥2 teams in the past year (ie, highly 
involved athletes). 
21
In addition to these key variables, 
several control variables were 
included to account for any 
potentially confounding factors 
that are known to be associated 
with NPOU and heroin use in the 
MTF sample. 
13, 
 
22 These variables 
include sex, race, grade level of 
respondent, suspension from school, 
parental education, urbanicity, 
region in the United States, cohort 
year, lifetime cigarette use, lifetime 
alcohol use, lifetime illicit drug use 
other than opioids and heroin (ie, 
marijuana, LSD, psychedelics, crack, 
cocaine, nonmedical amphetamine 
use, nonmedical barbiturate use, 
nonmedical tranquilizer use, 
inhalants, or steroids), and grade of 
initiation of NPOU and heroin.
Analysis
Multiple logistic regression was used 
to examine the odds of reporting 
lifetime NPOU and heroin use among 
respondents who indicated being 
involved in sports and exercise 
during the past year versus those who 
indicated no past year involvement in 
these activities. Additional descriptive 
and multivariate analyses were 
conducted to examine lifetime NPOU 
and heroin use between 1997 and 
2014. Moreover, multiple logistic 
regression analyses of lifetime 
heroin users were conducted to 
examine whether respondents who 
indicated participating in sports 
and exercise had greater odds of 
reporting initiation of NPOU before 
initiating heroin use, or concurrently 
with heroin use, when compared 
with respondents who indicated no 
past-year involvement in sports and 
exercise.
For the analyses, Stata 14.0 (version 
14.0; StataCorp, College Station, TX) 
was used to estimate the models 
outlined above. All logistic regression 
models provided adjusted odds 
ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) while controlling for 
the potentially confounding factors 
outlined above. All analyses used the 
weights provided by the MTF (public 
use files) to account for the probability 
of selection into the sample. Finally, 
given missing data in the MTF sample, 
multiple imputation was used to 
impute missing observations. 
23 In 
particular, sequential regression 
imputation was used to impute 
missing values; several separate 
imputations with the full MTF sample 
used chained multinomial, logistic, 
and ordered logit models in Stata’s 
mi impute chained procedure (10 
imputations, 5 burn-in iterations each; 
the augment option was used in the 
presence of perfect prediction). The 
percentages of respondents missing 
data for all the measures used in the 
analyses are provided in  
Table 1.
RESULTS
The descriptive results presented 
in  
Table 1 show that 7.6% of 
respondents reported lifetime NPOU 
and 1.6% reported lifetime heroin 
use. The majority of respondents 
reported past-year athletic 
participation, with 53.3% indicating 
involvement in sports and exercise 
almost every day, 38.8% indicating 
involvement in sports and exercise 
once a week at most, and 7.9% 
indicating no past-year involvement 
in sports and exercise.

0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93) had lower 
odds of indicating both past-year 
NPOU and past-year heroin use when 
compared with respondents who 
reported no involvement in these 
activities (results for past-year NPOU 
and heroin use are not provided in 
 
Table 2).
With respect to the overall trends 
in lifetime prevalence of NPOU and 
heroin use,  
Fig 1 shows declines in 
both lifetime NPOU (1997–1999, 
10.1% vs 2012–2014, 5.0%) and 
lifetime heroin use (1997–1999, 
2.3% vs 2012–2014, 1.0%). The aORs 
presented in  
Table 1 indicate that 
these differences in prevalence rates 
between the earliest (1997–1999) 
and latest cohort (2012–2014) 
are significantly lower (P < .001). 
It should also be noted that the 
decreasing prevalence rates in 
lifetime heroin use among eighth and 
10th graders match what is reported 
by MTF; however, the MTF does not 
provide prevalence rates in lifetime 
NPOU among eighth and 10th 
graders in the yearly monographs, so 
comparisons cannot be made.

Figure 2 shows similar declines in 
lifetime NPOU and lifetime heroin 
use among both respondents who 
indicated participating in sports 
and exercise almost every day and 
those who indicated no past-year 
involvement in these activities. It 
should be noted that no significant 
interactions were found between 
cohort years and participation in 
sports and exercise, indicating 
similar declines in prevalence rates 
between 1997 and 2014.
 
Table 3 shows the results from the 
logistic regression models examining 
past-year participation in sports 
and exercise and history of initiating 
NPOU in relation to initiating heroin 
among respondents who reported 
lifetime heroin use. The results 
indicate that respondents who 
reported participating in sports and 
exercise almost every day had lower 
odds of initiating NPOU and heroin in 
the same grade and had lower odds 
of initiating NPOU in ≥1 grade before 
first heroin use when compared 
with respondents who reported 
no involvement in these activities. 
Moreover, respondents who reported 
participating in sports and exercise 
once a week at most had lower odds 
of initiating heroin use in at least 
≥1 grade before first NPOU when 
compared with respondents who 
reported no involvement in these 
activities.
Finally, it should be noted that 
additional analyses (ie, negative 
binomial regression) were estimated 
to assess the mean frequency of 
lifetime and past-year NPOU and 
heroin use among adolescents 
who indicated being involved in 
sports and exercise during the past 
year versus those who indicated 
no past-year involvement in these 
activities. Similar results were 
found with respect to the logistic 
regression analyses examining both 
lifetime and past-year prevalence 
of NPOU and heroin use. Moreover, 
additional sensitivity analyses 
examining the 5 original categories 
provided for past-year involvement 
in sports and exercise (ie, no past

year involvement, a few times a 
year, 1 or 2 times a month, at least 
once a week, and almost every day) 
were estimated and confirmed that 
greater levels of involvement in 
sports and exercise were associated 
with lower odds of NPOU, heroin 
use, and initiating NPOU before (or 
concurrently with) heroin use.
DISCUSSION
This was the first national study to 
examine trends in lifetime NPOU and 
heroin use among US adolescents 
involved in sports and exercise. 
Moreover, it was the first study 
to examine whether adolescents 
involved in these activities were 
more likely to have a history of 
NPOU before (or concurrently 
with) initiating heroin use. The 
analyses found that trends in both 
lifetime NPOU and heroin use among 
adolescents involved in sports and 
exercise, along with adolescents 
who were not involved in these 
activities, has declined at a similar 
pace between 1997 and 2014. For 
instance, among adolescents who 
reported participating in sports and 
exercise almost every day, lifetime 
prevalence rates of NPOU and heroin 
use declined from 8.8% and 1.8% 
in 1997 to 4.4% to 0.8% in 2014, 
respectively. The logistic regression 
analyses also found that adolescents 
who indicated participating in 
sports and exercise had lower odds 
of reporting lifetime (and past-
year) NPOU and heroin use when 
compared with adolescents who did 
not participate in these activities, 
when key sociodemographic and 
substance use behaviors were 
controlled for. Additional analyses 
among lifetime heroin users also 
found that adolescents who reported 
daily involvement in sports and 
exercise had lower odds of initiating 
NPOU before (or concurrently with) 
first heroin use when compared with 
their peers who did not participate in 
these activities.
The results of this study suggest that 
participation in sports and exercise 
may serve as a protective factor with 
respect to NPOU and heroin use. The 
physical activity and positive social 
connections embedded in sports 
may be positive developmental 
experiences that can deter youth 
from serious types of illicit 
substance use such as NPOU, heroin 
use, or cocaine use. 
24, 
 
25 Although 
participation in sports and physical 
activity generally have 
been found to be negatively 
associated with illicit substance 
use (excluding alcohol) among 
adolescents, 
 
26 
–28 other studies have 
suggested that certain types of sports 
that involve high levels of contact 
or risk of injury put adolescents at 
greater risk for NPOU. 
14 Although 
athletes in high-injury sports should 
be monitored for opioid analgesic 
prescriptions and misuse, the 
overwhelming majority of athletes 
do not participate in these types of 
sports 
29 and are not at a higher risk 
of using or misusing prescription 
opioids or heroin.
Although this study provides the 
first examination of the initiation 
patterns involving NPOU and heroin 
use among adolescents involved 
in sports and exercise, several 
limitations must be considered. 
First, this study relies on cross-
sectional data and cannot examine 
the temporal ordering of sport 
participation, NPOU, and heroin 
use. For instance, it is plausible 
that those who initiate NPOU and 
heroin use were more likely to 
drop out of sports and exercise at 
least a year before taking the MTF 
survey. Although this limitation 
may be problematic, the cross-
sectional design of the MTF allowed 
the researchers to examine a large 
sample of adolescent athletes 
involved in sports and exercise 
who were heroin users and made 
it possible to examine trends and 
patterns of NPOU and heroin 
use among this subpopulation of 
adolescents. Another limitation 
was how sport participation was 
measured in the current study. The 
measure used to examine athletes 
in this study may have included 
respondents who engaged only 
in exercise, with no history of 
participating in sports. Despite this 
limitation of the measure used to 
examine participation in sports, it 
provides a good indicator of physical 
activity that is consistent with 
measures assessing highly involved 
athletes. 
21
CONCLUSIONS
This study provides a valuable 
analysis of the transition of NPOU 
and heroin use among adolescents 
involved in sports and exercise 
during a period of increased 
prescription opioid use in the US 
population. Future study designs 
should examine sport type to 
determine whether athletes in high-
contact sports are at a greater risk of 
transitioning from NPOU to heroin 
use because of their higher risk of 
injury and exposure to prescription 
opioids. Moreover, greater effort 
among large-scale surveys of 
drug use should incorporate more 
questions on sports injury and pain 
management because of the large 
number of US adolescents who 
participate in sports. Given that large 
sample sizes are needed to examine 
low-occurring types of substance use 
in the adolescent population, such 
studies have a unique opportunity 
to help expand our knowledge of the 
risks and benefits of adolescent sport 
participation.
