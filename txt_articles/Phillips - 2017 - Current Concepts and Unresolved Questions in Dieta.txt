Current Concepts and Unresolved
Questions in Dietary Protein

Protein needs for otherwise healthy individuals older than 19 years are defined by the 
recommended dietary allowance (RDA) at 0.80 g protein/kg/day. There is no recom-
mendation in the current RDA for subpopulations of older adults or people in various 
pathological situations. Despite the lack of a separate recommendation, there exists a 
growing body of evidence that is strongly suggestive of an increased need and/or benefit 
for protein in older persons. That is, intakes beyond the RDA are, in older persons, 
associated with benefits. In addition, a number of catabolic states including critical illness 
also result in a sharp elevation in the needs for protein and amino acids. An underap-
preciated issue in protein nutrition is the impact of protein quality on clinically relevant 
outcomes. The introduction of a new protein scoring system—the digestible indispens-
able amino acid score (DIAAS)—for protein quality has raised a forgotten awareness of 
protein quality. The DIAAS, which replaces the protein digestibility-corrected amino acid 
score (PDCAAS), is based on ileal digestibility of protein and a different test protein than 
PDCAAS and has values greater than 1.0. The aim of this article is a brief review and 
summary recommendations for protein nutrition and protein requirements in populations 
who would benefit from more protein than the RDA. The emphasis of the review is 
on muscle protein turnover, and there is a discussion of the impact of protein quality, 
particularly as it applies to commercially available protein sources. The evidence for more 
optimal protein intakes is considered in light of the potential health risks of consumption 
of protein at levels greater than the RDA.

iNTRODUCTiON
Body proteins are constantly being turned over. This constant synthesis and degradation of proteins 
provides for a mechanism of protein maintenance in the event that proteins are damaged due to 
oxidative stress, protein misfolding, or other processes [for review see Ref. (1)]. The flux through 
protein synthesis and degradation is affected by a number of variables including age, activity level, 
sex, hormones, disease, and diet (2). However, gains or losses in body protein mass, mostly measured 
as a reduction in lean body mass (LBM), are due to acute and chronic imbalances in protein turnover 
(3). Thus, the relative rates of protein synthesis and breakdown and their effectors are important to 
understand in the context of any change in LBM. What is also important to realize is that the relative 
rates of protein turnover in various tissues differ markedly. For example, muscle protein turnover

proceeds at a rate of 0.06%/h (~1.5%/day) (3), blood protein 
turnover rates vary markedly from 1 to 30%/h (4), and intestinal 
protein turnover rates vary from 1 to 2%/h (5). Thus, contribution 
to total body protein turnover, which would be a function of the 
protein turnover rate and the size of the protein pool, would vary 
substantially. The ingestion of protein and subsequent hyperami-
noacidemia result in a stimulation of protein synthesis, and this 
appears to be true regardless of the anatomical and subcellular 
protein pool (6) being studied (7). Feeding-induced hyperami-
noacidemia and the transient stimulation of protein synthesis 
result in a transient 3- to 4-h period of net protein accretion (3). 
During fasted periods, the relative hypoaminoacidemia results in 
a reduced stimulation of protein synthesis and protein breakdown 
is, comparatively, elevated (3). Thus, acute feeding and fasting 
result in transient (hours) fluctuations in protein synthesis and 
breakdown of proteins (3). There are also chronic (weeks, years) 
periods of protein gain during growth, pregnancy, and muscular 
hypertrophy. In contrast, there are chronic periods of protein loss 
that occur during disease, with aging, and during inactivity (bed 
rest, immobilization) (3).
Protein requirements for healthy persons older than 19 years 
are set according to the recommended dietary allowance (RDA), 
which currently stands (and has remained unchanged for a 
number of years) at 0.80 g/kg/day (8). A number of reports have 
challenged the concept of the RDA as a minimal requirement 
rather than a “recommended” intake of protein that is “allowed” 
and questioned whether more optimal health outcomes could be 
achieved with protein intakes greater than the RDA. Implicitly, 
the acceptable macronutrient distribution range (AMDR), stat-
ing that anywhere from 10 to 35% of total energy intake can 
come from protein, is a tacit endorsement that protein intakes 
at levels higher (much higher) than the RDA are associated with 
good health. While nuanced in details the general assessment of 
why dietary protein intakes greater than the RDA are optimal 
 
(as opposed to minimal) are based around assessments of appetite 
regulation, weight loss and maintenance, and LBM preservation 
[for reviews, see Ref. (9–11)]. Balanced against a recommenda-
tion for protein intakes that are greater than the minimal level are 
health concerns around renal and bone health.
The aim of this short review is to examine the basis of protein 
requirements and to review evidence that points to benefits of 
protein intakes greater than the current RDA. The focus is on 
healthy adults, the elderly, and critical illness. In the context of 
understanding protein requirements, a brief discussion of protein 
quality under the older [protein digestibility-corrected amino 
acid score (PDCAAS)] and newer [digestible indispensable 
amino acid score (DIAAS)] scoring systems is also presented.
PROTeiN ReQUiReMeNTS
Current protein requirements set the RDA at 0.80 g/kg/day, 
and this is based on nitrogen balance (8). Nitrogen balance has 
been used for more than 60 years to establish protein require-
ments, and the balance methodology is used not only for protein 
but also for a number of other nutrients. There have long been 
recognition of the shortcomings of nitrogen balance (12) yet it is 
the methodology that underpins the RDA, a value that is used by 
many in nutritional practice as a target for protein intake. While 
the discussion may be semantic, the term RDA would inherently 
imply that the protein intake is “recommended,” and it is all that 
you are “allowed” to eat. Of course, neither is strictly speaking 
true, and the definition of the RDA is that it “…is an estimate 
of the minimum daily average dietary intake level that meets the 
nutrient requirements of nearly all (97 to 98 percent) healthy 
individuals in a particular life stage and gender group” (p. 24). 
A pertinent question is whether there is benefit to consuming 
protein at a level that is above the minimum? The RDA for protein 
has been challenged as a concept that should drive protein intakes 
(13). It was pointed out by Wolfe and Miller that the AMDR for 
protein at 10–35% of energy coming from protein is concept that 
is more in line with an optimal rather than a minimal dietary 
strategy. Nonetheless, a comparison of the protein requirement 
(RDA) of a 55-year-old man who is 1.80 m, weighing 80 kg, at 
64 g protein/day versus the range of protein intakes from the 
AMDR of 65–228 g protein/day (assuming an energy require-
ment of 2,600 kcal/day or 10.9 MJ/day) reveals quite a disparate 
recommendation. The Institute of Medicine states that the AMDR 
“…is provided to give guidance in dietary planning by taking into 
account the trends related to decreased risk of disease identified 
in epidemiological and clinical studies” (p. 29). Thus, there are, 
according to the AMDR, protein intakes that are well above the 
RDA (up to 2.8 g/kg/day) that are associated with good health. 
Interestingly, an alternative interpretation, applying a bi-phase 
linear regression as opposed to a linear regression model, of the 
same data used to establish the RDA for protein (14) has come to 
the conclusion that even minimal protein requirements for healthy 
young men (and presumably women) should be 1.0 g/kg/day (15) 
and as high as 1.2 g/kg/day (16). Thus, there is disagreement over 
whether 0.8 g/kg/day is a minimum value and should be the RDA 
(14) or whether protein intakes of 1–1.2 g/kg/day (15, 16), using 
nitrogen balance, are a minimum intake. As a variable, age was 
considered in the original formulation of the RDA for protein, 
and Rand et al. (14) concluded that, “…there was a difference of 
almost 27 mg N/kg/d in the median requirement; however, the 
difference was not statistically significant.” Relevant to a discus-
sion of protein requirements in the elderly is the fact that the data 
used to formulate this conclusion (14) came from only 14 older 
(older than 67 years) men and women (seven of each).
The indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) method for deter-
mining protein requirements has been developed as an alternative 
to nitrogen balance. While an extensive discussion of the IAAO 
method, and its assumptions, is not warranted here, the interested 
reader may wish to refer to several reviews on the topic (17, 18). 
The IAAO method has consistently yielded higher estimates for 
protein requirements than nitrogen balance (15, 19), particularly 
in the elderly (20–22). From these studies, a safe minimal protein 
intake would be 1.0–1.2 g/kg/day for normal healthy younger 
persons (16) and at least 1.2 g/kg/day and perhaps as high as 
 
1.4 g/kg/day for older persons (20–22). Of course, even these 
estimates are minimal not optimal, and these intakes need to be 
tested in longer term trials to establish the longer term ramifica-
tions of consuming a protein intake at this level. Of relevance to 
longer term health outcomes for older persons is the impact of 
consuming protein at levels of at least 1.2 g/kg/day on LBM. This

point is emphasized to even greater degree when one considers 
that 25% of older men, and up to 50% of older women, are not 
consuming the protein RDA let alone a protein intake of 1.2 g/
kg/day (23).
PROTeiN QUAliTY
The RDA for protein at 0.80 g/kg/day is recommended to come 
from mixed sources of proteins of generally high quality. Until 
recently, protein quality was estimated using the PDCAAS. An 
expert recommendation has, however, been that the PDCAAS 
be replaced in favor of a new scoring system called the DIAAS 
(24). There are some notable differences between PDCAAS and 
DIAAS, and the main reasons to advocate DIAAS as a replace-
ment for PDCAAS are around the shortcomings of the PDCAAS 
method, specifically:
 
1. protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score uses fecal 
protein digestibility, and there is significant bacterial (colonic) 
metabolism of amino acids that can falsely enhance values of 
true protein digestibility;
 
2. truncation of PDCAAS values at 1.0 does not account for the 
bioavailability of individual indispensable amino acids that 
may have specific roles, and thus, proteins of higher quality 
are not identified;
 
3. protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score values are 
overestimated because of limited bioavailability of specific 
forms of amino acids such as lysine (25); and
 
4. fecal protein digestibility values are determined using rats, 
which have a different requirement for amino acids for growth 
and maintenance versus humans.
Table 1 lists the PDCAAS and DIAAS of some commercially 
available isolated protein sources and some commonly consumed 
protein-containing foods. The limiting amino acids in the pro-
teins and foods listed in Table 1 differ, but an important point is 
the reference for PDCAAS is egg protein, whereas in DIAAS, it 
is a theoretical best protein. The implementation of DIAAS will, 
however, take time, and a number of proteins and protein sources 
will have to be examined for their ileal digestibility. Ileal digest-
ibility would be very difficult to measure in humans and even so 
in animal systems (24), and it may be more practical to rely on 
in vitro digestion methods to establish digestibility.
Hydrolyzed collagen has become a mainstay in a number of 
supplements, and it has a quality score of 0 unless supplemented 
with tryptophan. Even with tryptophan supplementation, 
collagen has a very low quality score (Table 1). An often cited 
benefit of collagen supplementation is that since it is derived from 
bone and cartilage, it contains all of the amino acids necessary to 
support the health of these tissues. However, it is important to 
realize that most amino acids contained in hydrolyzed collagen 
are non-essential [i.e., glycine (Gly), proline (Pro), alanine (Ala)] 
or posttranslationally modified [i.e., hydroxyproline (HyPro)], 
and thus, there is not a strong case to be made for supplementa-
tion with a protein source that contains amino acids that adults 
can readily synthesize (Gly, Pro, Ala) or that cannot be utilized 
due to the lack of a tRNA for the amino acids, which is the case 
for HyPro. Nonetheless, collagen appears in a number of sup-
plements targeted at older persons (28), which is in opposition 
to the recommendation that older persons consumed a higher 
protein and leucine (see below) intake. As Castellanos et al. 
stated, “…collagen-based supplements that provide insufficient 
amounts of many IAAs when compared with the 2005 DRI refer-
ence pattern are not considered to be ‘complete’ proteins” (28).
leUCiNe
An important consideration relevant to protein quality is the 
recognition that leucine, the indispensable amino acid, is not only 
a building block for protein synthesis but also, in muscle, a trigger 
for protein synthesis (29–32). The existence of an intracellular 
leucine “trigger” (3, 33–35) predicts that postprandial leucinemia 
and the ensuing increase in intracellular leucine concentration is 
stimulus that results in a rise in muscle protein synthesis (MPS). 
This stimulation appears to be via the leucine-binding protein 
Sestrin2 (36, 37), which results in activation of the mechanistic 
target of rapamycin-complex 1 (38). Therefore, stimulation of 
MPS would require ingestion of a protein that is higher in leucine 
or fortification of a lower leucine-containing protein (i.e., lower 
quality or lower dose) with leucine (34, 35). In fact, part of the FAO 
recommendations on protein quality were that individual amino 
acids be treated as nutrients (24), and in the case of preservation 
or restoration of lost muscle mass, leucine would be an important 
or perhaps the most important amino acid in stimulating MPS 
(3, 33–35). The amino acid content of proteins using the DIAAS-
based ideal protein yield individual amino acid reference ratios 
(AARRs), which are ratios of each indispensable amino acid in 
a protein relative to the ideal protein. Given the importance of 
leucine for stimulating MPS and driven muscle protein retention, 
the AARR for leucine is shown for seven commonly consumed

supplemental proteins (Table 2). Importantly, in none of the 
proteins highlighted in table is leucine considered the rate limit-
ing amino acid (Table 1) in normal healthy persons; however, it 
is worth appreciating that in states of muscle loss (aging, critical 
illness), leucine would become of paramount importance. Thus, 
considerations of protein quality by DIAAS aside, the leucine 
content of a protein would also be important to consider, and 
this appears to be particularly true in aging (39). Thus, as Table 2 
highlights milk-based proteins would be, gram-for-gram, better 
sources of protein to provide to support the delivery of leucine 
to support MPS. Such a recommendation would be particularly 
relevant in situations where protein intake is restricted (for exam-
ple, in kidney disease) and limited (such as in older persons with 
a limited appetite) and in situations of pronounced catabolism, 
which is commonly observed in patients in intensive care.
The elderly appear to have a greater requirement for leucine 
to stimulate protein synthesis than their younger counterparts 
meaning that older persons would need to be provided with greater 
intakes of protein or leucine to stimulate MPS and, presumably, 
retain muscle (39–42). Hence, proteins that contain a high per-
centage of leucine would be advantageous to stimulate MPS and 
promote lean mass retention (43). An important consideration is 
that higher protein/leucine to activate MPS and stimulate reten-
tion of muscle could be thus achieved with lower protein intakes 
if higher leucine-containing protein were consumed. This may be 
important for the elderly in whom energy intake is relevant, and 
lower protein intakes may avoid a potential appetite suppression 
(44). A remaining research question is whether diets higher in 
leucine could be used in a chronic setting to attenuate the loss 
of muscle mass and function. Results from recent sufficiently 
long and an appropriately powered trial indicate that this may 
be the case (43). A twice daily dietary supplement for 13 weeks 
containing whey protein, leucine, and vitamin D (20 g whey pro-
tein, 3 g total leucine, and 800 IU vitamin D) was given to older 
(~78 years) primarily independent-living sarcopenic adults and 
resulted in improved chair–stand test time and showed a greater 
gain in appendicular muscle mass than the control group (43). It 
is not possible to isolate the results of this trial to protein/leucine 
alone due to the added vitamin D (43); however, the impact of 
vitamin D on muscle mass and function appears to be minimal 
(45) or is restricted to older persons with deficient levels of vita-
min D (i.e., less than 30 nmol/L) (46). In addition, a separate trial 
using a similarly formulated protein/leucine vitamin D-enriched 
supplement showed similar benefits (47). A meta-analysis exam-
ining the impact of leucine-based supplements concluded that 
sarcopenic patients taking leucine-based supplements gained 
LBM, but did not show gains in either grip or leg strength (48).
AGiNG
Aging is associated with a slow loss of muscle mass and function, 
termed sarcopenia. Sarcopenic muscle loss proceeds at a rate of 
~0.8%/year, and strength is lost at a rate of ~1–3%/year (49, 50). It 
is difficult to say exactly when sarcopenia begins, but it likely that 
in the fifth decade of life that muscle mass and function begin to 
measurably decline dependent to large extent on a persons’ level 
of physical activity and general health (49, 50). Nonetheless, as 
potent drivers of muscle protein turnover, physical activity and 
dietary protein can be manipulated to attenuate losses in LBM. 
Clinical observations of changes in LBM give credence to a pro-
tein-/leucine-driven thesis of muscle retention and support the 
recommendation for greater protein/leucine in older persons to 
stimulate MPS and aid in retention of LBM (51, 52). For example, 
men and women (n = 2,066) aged 70–79 years in the highest 
quintile of protein intake (~1.1 g/kg/day, 18.7% energy from pro-
tein) lost approximately 40% less LBM and appendicular (arms 
and legs) LBM than did those in the lowest quintile of protein 
intake (~0.7 g/kg/day, 11.2% energy from protein) (53). While the 
associations were attenuated slightly after adjustment for change 
in fat mass, the results remained significant (53). McDonald et al. 
(54) reported that dietary leucine intake was associated with LBM 
change in older (>65 years) persons across 6 years of follow-up. 
Older participants in the highest quartile of leucine intake (7⋅1 g/
day) experienced LBM maintenance, whereas lower intakes were 
associated with LBM loss over 6 years. This relationship was not 
modified by sex or the presence of cardiovascular disease. The 
authors concluded (54) that a greater leucine intake in conjunc-
tion with adequate total protein intake was associated with long-
term LBM retention in a healthy older Danish population. These 
observations (53, 54) are similar to those reported in other studies 
(55, 56); primarily, higher protein intakes result in a greater net 
retention of LBM in older persons.
An important point, however, is that preservation of muscle 
mass while laudable is important only if it is associated with an 
improvement in strength and function. An effect of protein sup-
plementation on muscle mass and function has been seen in some 
protein/leucine intervention trials (43, 47) and observational data 
(57). In addition, cross-sectional analysis of dietary intake data 
has shown a relationship between total (57) and per-meal protein 
intake on not only muscle mass but also muscle function (58). 
In fact, the concept of not just daily protein intake but per-meal 
protein intake, to provide a more optimal per-meal stimulation 
of MPS, may be an important area of research especially in the 
elderly (59). A recent trial in middle-aged adults showed that sup-
plementation of the breakfast and lunchtime meals, meals lower in 
protein in many societies, was able to promote LBM accretion (60).
CRiTiCAl illNeSS
Critical illness is characterized by a pronounced rapid reduc-
tion in LBM (61, 62). This reduction is due to a combination of 
inactivity, hypercytokinemia, and hypercortisolemia that reduce

MPS and increase muscle protein breakdown (MPB) (62, 63). 
A number of clinical guidelines recommend protein intakes in 
critical illness (64, 65) of at least 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day. These recom-
mendations have been challenged, however, as being too low, 
and Hoffer and Bistrian have recommended protein provision 
of 2–2.5 g/kg/day for critically ill patients (66, 67). This level of 
protein intake is rationalized by these authors as being necessary 
to offset the sharp negative nitrogen balances seen in critically 
ill patients (66, 67). It has been argued by the same authors that 
it is not appropriate to simply feed the critically ill more energy 
(68) and that protein is the most important macronutrient 
 
(66, 67) to provide substrate for all protein-requiring processes, 
which would be under the influence of pro-catabolic and anti-
anabolic stimulation. Nonetheless, an analysis of nitrogen bal-
ance in older intensive care unit (ICU) patients showed that they 
were refractory to lower protein intakes and that it was not until 
protein intakes that were greater than 2 g/kg/day that nitrogen 
balance became positive (69, 70). The lack of response of whole-
body nitrogen balance in older ICU patients (69, 70) is similar to 
what has been seen in healthy older persons with respect to MPS 
(71). Namely, in healthy older persons, there is a lowered anabolic 
response to lower protein intakes, but at higher protein intakes, 
there is a stimulation of protein synthesis (71) and/or a suppres-
sion of proteolysis (69, 70), which results in improved protein 
balance. The case for higher protein intakes in the critically ill 
 
(66, 67) currently lacks clinical trial support, but appears to have 
some support in the elderly (69, 70).
The potential for ureagenesis and azotemia leading to impair-
ments in renal function is a concern on patients in the ICU, 
particularly the elderly. According to Dickerson (70), the survival 
advantage, at least based on the observational data, in those 
receiving higher protein intakes (72–74) would be a strong indi-
cation that renal function is less important. Instead, Dickerson 
says, “…the limitation of protein intake on a short-term basis is 
unwarranted in the patient without overt acute kidney failure… 
The whole theoretical point of compromising renal function 
with higher protein intakes is moot if the patient is not given a 
sufficient protein intake in an effort to survive the acute insult 
that led to ICU admission” (70). It would of course be beneficial 
to have better clinical data on higher versus lower protein intakes 
in critically ill patients and to show improved survival balanced 
against measures of renal function.
PReSSURe UlCeRS AND ACUTe AND 
CHRONiC illNeSS
Two areas in which protein provision has been examined and 
postulated to play a beneficial role are in pressure ulcer healing 
and acute illness. Pressure ulcers occur in up to 10% of hospital-
ized patients and are potentially fatal particularly in older more 
frail patients (75). Expert consensus recommendations for pres-
sure ulcer healing are for a protein provision of 1.25–1.5 g/kg/day, 
which received a positive recommendation based on clinical trial 
evidence (76). While recommendations for pressure ulcer heal-
ing are for nutrition to be delivered via normal dietary sources, 
this is not always feasible. Several trials using arginine-enriched 
protein-containing supplements have been shown to yield 
 
positive results on pressure ulcer healing (77–79). In addition, 
a trial of 1.2 versus 1.6 g/kg/day of protein resulted in improved 
pressure healing (80). The most recent meta-analysis of data 
for nutritional support of pressure ulcer healing included 23 
randomized control trials (RCTs) and examined a variety of 
supplements (81). While the supplements were mixed in terms 
of composition, there were 11 of the 23 RCTs in which a mixed 
nutrient supplement containing protein alone and mixed sup-
plements of protein, vitamins, carbohydrate, and lipids were 
studied. All 11 studies compared the nutritional intervention 
with a standard intervention, for example, standard hospital diet, 
or standard hospital diet plus placebo. The authors stated, “The 
clearest conclusion that can be drawn… is that it remains unclear 
whether nutritional supplementation reduces the risk of pressure 
ulcer development” (81). Similar conclusions were reached for 
pressure ulcer healing (81). Thus, while protein needs appear 
to be elevated in patients undergoing wound healing (13) and 
recommendations are for higher protein intakes in pressure ulcer 
healing (76) and acute illness in older persons in general (51), the 
use of high-energy protein-containing supplements is equivocal 
at this time (81). Clearly, larger trials with attempts to assess both 
ulcer incidence and ulcer healing and targeted protein intakes 
would be valuable.
The benefits of protein supplementation with acute ill-
ness are not readily apparent. Only a few small trials have 
attempted to improve protein intake in people with acute illness 
 
(51, 82, 83). In general, protein-containing supplements result 
in small improvements in outcomes that are more marked when 
combined with programs of rehabilitation/physical activity (82). 
In malnourished or undernourished patients, some outcomes 
are improved, and meta-analyses have shown (84, 85) improved 
nutritional status. The interventions used in the trials (84, 85) 
aimed to provide between 175 additional kcal/day and up to a 
maximum of 1,350 additional kcal/day. Additional protein was 
between 10 and 50 g protein/day (84, 85). Some outcomes were 
improved with protein/energy supplementation (85). Most 
notably, older undernourished or malnourished persons showed, 
with protein/energy supplementation, weight gain, reduced mor-
tality, and a reduced risk of morbidity [infectious complications, 
total pressure sores, patients too ill to continue, exacerbation of 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), anesthetic, sur-
gical infection, hospital readmission, incomplete wound healing, 
prescription of antibiotics, and total severe adverse events] (85). 
There was no detectable effect of protein/energy supplementa-
tion on functional outcomes (85), which likely requires either the 
addition of a structured activity program (51) or at least needs to 
be adequately powered to detect such outcomes (43).
Meta-analyses of nutritional supplementation in patients with 
stable COPD have reported a benefit (86). The main outcomes 
improved in stable COPD patients with protein/energy supple-
mentation were increases in LBM and weight gain especially if 
malnourished. There was also low-quality evidence that patients 
with COPD were able to improve their exercise capacity (6-min 
walk test) and also their health-related quality of life (86). Since 
low body weight and muscle mass are common in people with 
COPD as well as some degree of malnutrition, the improvements 
seen are encouraging (86). Interestingly, pulmonary and physical

rehabilitation has been shown to relieve dyspnea and fatigue and 
enhanced the sense of control that individuals have over their 
condition as well as improving their health-related quality of life 
and exercise capacity (87). Given the potential synergy between 
exercise and protein supplementation, it would be interesting to 
determine whether a synergism between protein and pulmonary 
rehabilitation exists.
Currently, consensus guidelines recommend a higher protein 
intake for patients with pressure ulcers (76). Existing evidence 
does not support a role of multiingredient supplements providing 
protein on pressure ulcer incidence or healing (81).
What appears clear is that protein–energy-containing sup-
plements are more likely to have measurable impacts in older 
undernourished or malnourished individuals and in those who 
are sarcopenic. The impact of these supplements on functional 
outcomes is small, if present at all, and would likely require the 
addition of an activity/exercise program, which may be synergis-
tic with protein supplementation in enhancing outcomes (88).
Patients with stable COPD derive small but clinically meaning-
ful benefits from protein/energy supplementation. It is unclear in 
most trials whether outcomes are due to energy provision per se 
or protein provision, although as protein is a functional substrate 
as well as potentially being active in signaling and metabolism, it 
is likely that it is protein per se and not total energy intake that is 
responsible for observed changes.
ADJUNCTive iNGReDieNTS
There are a number of adjunctive ingredients that have been 
added to protein formulations to aid in outcomes related to skel-
etal muscle retention and function. The discussion here is focused 
on two ingredients for which there is enough evidence to discuss 
relevant outcomes: beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (β-HMB) 
and creatine. Humans have a limited capacity to endogenously 
synthesize β-HMB, a metabolite of the amino acid leucine 
 
(89, 90), that has been extensively studied in clinical trials and 
shown to have small impacts on gains in LBM (89–91). Leucine 
and β-HMB have parallel modes of action in terms of stimulat-
ing MPS (92) and inhibiting MPB (93) although the signaling 
pathways may be distinct (92). Thus, it would be expected that 
by comparison to protein that provides leucine, the impact of 
β-HMB would be minimal; however, in clinical trials, β-HMB 
has most often been compared to a mixture of dispensable amino 
acids (DAAs) or a non-caloric placebo (89, 90). In an attempt to 
meta-analyze the impact of β-HMB on the elderly, Molfino et al. 
(90) concluded, “Meta-analysis was not feasible due to the con-
siderable variation in study design, the type and timing of HMB 
intervention…” and importantly in the same review, the authors 
stated, “Quite surprisingly, studies evaluating the effects of HMB 
alone in old adults were limited.” Thus, the effects of β-HMB 
in older adults are limited in terms of what can be concluded 
as to effect of the supplements on LBM and muscle function, a 
conclusion supported by Fitschen et al. (91). Despite the conclu-
sion reached by Molfino et al. (90), Wu et al. (89) did perform 
a meta-analysis of β-HMB and its effects in the elderly. These 
authors included 7 RCTs with 147 older adults receiving β-HMB 
and 140 receiving a non-caloric or DAA control placebo (89). The 
meta-analysis showed greater muscle mass gain in the β-HMB 
(standardized mean difference = 352 g; 95% confidence interval: 
110–594 g). What is hard to reconcile is how the studies included 
in this analysis (89) could truly constitute a valid meta-analysis 
given the heterogeneity of the included interventions (includ-
ing other potentially active amino acids including arginine and 
glutamine in older subjects undergoing bed rest, women only, 
subjects undertaking resistance exercise training, and in patients 
with solid tumors). Despite a trivial effect of β-HMB on muscle 
mass, there were no improvements in muscle function (89).
Deutz et al. (94) supplemented a variety of older malnourished 
patients who were hospitalized (congestive heart failure, acute 
myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or COPD) with a protein-
containing supplement that contained β-HMB. Compared to 
the placebo group, the protein supplemented group showed no 
difference in 90-day readmission rate, but 90-day mortality was 
significantly lower. Protein supplementation resulted in improved 
odds of better nutritional status at 90 days and an increase in 
body weight at 30 days. There was no effect of supplementation 
on length of hospital stay or on function as assessed by activities 
of daily living (94). Due to the lack of a control group that did 
not consume β-HMB, but did consume the protein and energy, it 
was not possible to isolate the effect of the treatment to β-HMB. 
It appears, based on data from protein/energy supplements 
(85), that the effect of the protein energy supplement was due to 
increased energy and/or protein provided to the supplemented 
versus minor constituents such as β-HMB and/or vitamin D (95).
Creatine has been shown in meta-analyses to enhance 
exercise-induced gains in LBM as well as strength and function 
(96). It has also been postulated that creatine may be a functional 
ingredient in enhancing muscle mass and function even without 
resistance training in the elderly (97). There is also evidence for an 
effect of creatine on cognitive function, which may be of benefit in 
the elderly (98). As an ingredient in formulations, creatine could 
be a useful adjunct to protein. There have been concerns raised 
regarding creatine and renal function, but there is no evidence 
indicating that this may be the case (99, 100). Interestingly, a 
beneficial effect of creatine has been shown in medium- to high-
quality trials in patients with certain myopathies (101). Longer 
term trials employing creatine supplementation in populations 
such as the elderly, with adequate monitoring of renal function, 
would be of interest. Such trials would not have to include higher 
dose or “loading” phases of creatine but merely a chronic lower 
dose (3–5 g/day) of creatine to have an impact.
ADveRSe eFFeCTS OF DieTARY 
PROTeiN
Increased dietary protein is thought to have impact on renal 
function (102). What needs to be recognized is that the thesis 
that dietary protein is causative for renal disease is not supported 
by evidence (44). Both the WHO (103) and the US Institute of 
Medicine (8) in setting the requirements for protein have stated, 
“…that the protein content of the diet is not responsible for the 
progressive decline in kidney function with age” (p. 842) (8) 
and, “…protein restriction lowers glomerular filtration rate, 
suggesting that the decline of glomerular filtration rate with age 
 7

is a natural consequence of the decline in protein intake as age 
progresses, and is unrelated to deterioration of renal function” 
(p. 224) (103). For persons with chronic kidney disease (CKD), 
lower protein diets have been recommended as being “nephro-
protective” (104, 105). Current guidelines for those with CKD are 
to prescribe a lower protein diet, varying from as low as 0.3–0.9 g/
kg/day, dependent on disease stage (106, 107). Of note is that 
dietary acid load, which is related to protein intake, may be one 
of the key factors to consider as opposed to protein load, at least 
in those with earlier stage (3 or less) (105, 108, 109). It would 
seem prudent, on a low-protein intake even in patients with CKD, 
to emphasize the highest quality proteins possible (Table 1), due 
to the need for IAA. Trials of high-quality proteins, or ketoacid 
supplements, and potential combination with alkali-promoting 
foods or supplements (108, 109) would be a good avenue for 
future research.
Lines of evidence from epidemiological studies have led to 
the thesis that protein causes reductions in bone health (110). 
More recent evidence, however, favors the concept that protein is 
a bone health-supporting nutrient (111–113). In addition, meta-
analysis of superior quality calcium balance studies has shown 
that increasing dietary protein actually increases the absorption 
of calcium (114). Thus, it appears that rather than a protein-
induced acid load causing bone calcium resorption, increased 
dietary protein results in increased intestinal calcium absorption 
and has no net effect on bone calcium content or fracture risk 
(115). Applying Hill’s criteria for epidemiologic causation and 
in a systematic review and meta-analysis, Fenton et al. (116) 
concluded, “
A causal association between dietary acid load and 
osteoporotic bone disease is not supported by evidence and there 
is no evidence that an alkaline diet is protective of bone health.” 
Kerstetter et al. (111) have emphasized that protein may be only 
supportive of bone health when other nutrients such as calcium 
and vitamin D are consumed at recommended intake levels.
CONClUSiON
Current protein requirements may not be sufficient for older per-
sons. Importantly, there may be benefits associated with higher 
than minimal protein intakes, such as preservation of LBM and 
function, which are worth further investigation. The amino acid 
leucine appears to be a key in terms of triggering a rise in MPS, 
and thus its content in proteins would be worth considering when 
evaluating proteins for their ability to support retention of muscle 
mass. Older persons appear to require higher intakes of leucine 
to stimulate MPS than younger persons. It may be that higher 
per-meal intake of protein (leucine) is also worthy of further study 
as per-meal protein intakes are associated with improved muscle 
mass and function at least in observational data. Critical illness 
is another area where we see clinically relevant outcome data 
with higher protein intakes, for which there is a good theoretical 
framework. Consensus recommendations for pressure ulcers 
are that patients consume 1.2–1.5 g/kg/day (76); however, there 
appears to be no clear benefit of protein–energy supplementation 
on mitigating pressure ulcer development or healing although the 
data are from low-quality trials and none have studied protein 
supplementation (i.e., over and above requirements or current 
intakes) per se. Currently, trials of acute illness are too few to make 
a recommendation on a potential benefit of protein. Protein- and 
energy-containing supplements do have measurable impact in 
certain chronic conditions such as COPD, but are more likely to 
have an effect in persons who are malnourished/undernourished 
and in persons who are sarcopenic. The impact of protein sup-
plementation on functional outcomes is inconclusive at present, 
and it is likely that functional improvements are far more likely to 
be seen with supplement trials when combined with exercise and/
or in persons with impaired function. Certain ingredients show 
promise as adjuncts to protein in aiding in augmenting and/or 
preserving lean mass and function. The impact of β-HMB appears 
limited in older persons, with the potential exception of recovery 
from bed rest. Supplemental creatine is a promising ingredient 
that appears able to augment not only LBM but also function and 
ADL. There is no bona fide evidence linking dietary protein to the 
actual development of renal disease. Those patients with preexist-
ing renal disease are advised to manage their protein intake and 
dietary acid load in accordance with current guidelines (107). As 
opposed to dietary protein promoting bone loss, it is actually a 
bone-supporting nutrient but likely only when calcium (1–1.2 g/
day) and vitamin D (600 IU) intakes are sufficient.
