Identifying molecular alterations in normal tissue adjacent to cancer is important for
understanding cancer aetiology and designing preventive measures. Here we analyse the
DNA methylome of 569 breast tissue samples, including 50 from cancer-free women and 84
from matched normal cancer pairs. We use statistical algorithms for dissecting intra- and
inter-sample cellular heterogeneity and demonstrate that normal tissue adjacent to breast
cancer is characterized by tens to thousands of epigenetic alterations. We show that their
genomic distribution is non-random, being strongly enriched for binding sites of transcription
factors specifying chromatin architecture. We validate the field defects in an independent
cohort and demonstrate that over 30% of the alterations exhibit increased enrichment within
matched cancer samples. Breast cancers highly enriched for epigenetic field defects, exhibit
adverse clinical outcome. Our data support a model where clonal epigenetic reprogramming
towards reduced differentiation in normal tissue is an important step in breast carcinogenesis.

 T
he realization that tumours are heterogeneous entities1–3,
undergoing rapid evolution in response to intrinsic and
extrinsic selection4–7, has given renewed importance to the
study of cancer aetiology. Detecting molecular alterations, which
happen early in carcinogenesis, is not only important for our
understanding of carcinogenesis but also for implementing
potential cancer prevention and early detection strategies.
As access to the normal cells at the exact locations where
cancers arise is naturally impossible, the only approach in
humans to identify early molecular alterations is by comparison
of normal tissue from healthy individuals to the normal tissue
that is found adjacent to tumours. Such alterations, commonly
known as field defects/effects8, have been predicted to exist
mathematically9 and are thought to constitute the earliest clones
in the carcinogenic process10. Previous experimental studies have
described field defects in several cancers, including colorectal,
prostate,
breast,
lung,
oesophagus,
stomach
and
skin11.
More recently, a sequencing study identified genetic field
defects in normal prostate tissue, with the specific mutations,
also seen in the adjacent prostate cancers12. Although epigenetic
field defects, notably DNA methylation alterations, have also been
described13,14, it is still unknown how widespread epigenetic field
effects are and how they contribute to carcinogenesis11.
Here we make significant progress towards answering these
outstanding questions. By measuring DNA methylation in
almost half a million CpG sites, and using a statistical paradigm
for feature selection, we demonstrate the existence of widespread
epigenetic field defects in normal tissues adjacent to breast
cancers, with these defects becoming enriched in the progression
to breast cancer. These data are consistent with a model in which
epigenetic alterations predate the emergence of cancer.
Results
DNA methylation outliers identify field defects in breast cancer.
We generated Illumina 450k DNAm data in a large discovery set of
breast tissue samples, including 50 normal/benign samples from
cancer-free women, 42 matched normal–breast tumour pairs and
an additional 263 breast cancers (Methods, Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2). The data were of high quality, as assessed
using a stringent quality control pipeline, with the top component
of variation correlating with normal–tumour status (Methods,
Supplementary Fig. 1). To identify epigenetic field defects, we
initially restricted analysis to the 50 normal samples from
cancer-free women and the 42 normal samples from age-matched
female breast cancer patients (Fig. 1a). As adipose cells make a
substantial component of normal breast tissue15, we first devised a
statistical deconvolution algorithm to obtain sample-specific
estimates of a sample’s fat content (Methods). The algorithm
was successfully validated on independent adipose tissue data
(Methods, Supplementary Table 3). Singular value decomposition
over the 92 normal samples confirmed that the top component of
variation
strongly
correlated
with
a
sample’s
fat
content
(Supplementary Fig. 2). However, fat content did not vary
significantly between the normal and normal-adjacent samples
(Supplementary Fig. 3A), and adjustment for fat content did not
have a major impact on differential methylation analysis, with
differentially
methylated
CpGs
between
normal
and
normal-adjacent tissue not attaining genome-wide significance
(minimum false discovery rate (FDR) ¼ 0.3) in either adjusted or
unadjusted analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3B).
Owing to the evidence that DNA methylation changes in
normal cells at risk of undergoing morphological transformation
exhibit largely stochastic and heterogeneous patterns16, we
posited that identification of DNAm field defects would benefit
from
a
feature
selection
algorithm
that
recognizes
such
heterogeneity, for instance one based on differential variability
(DV, Fig. 1b)16,17. We developed a novel DV algorithm,
called iEVORA, (Methods, Fig. 1c), which identified a total
of 7,318 differentially variable and differentially methylated
CpGs (DVMCs; that is, B1.5% of the interrogated sites,
FDRo 0.001, Supplementary Data 1 and Fig. 2a,b), with the
majority of these DVMCs being more variable (4,062/7,318,
B56%) and hypermethylated (6,138/7,318, 84%) in the normal
samples adjacent to breast cancers (Binomial test P-values:
Po1e-20, Fig. 2c). A typical DNAm profile of a hypervariable
and hypermethylated DVMC, illustrates how increased variance,
and not increased mean DNAm level, is the main distinguishing
characteristic (Fig. 2d). Indeed, increased variance in the
normal-adjacent state was observed to be driven by a relatively
small number of outlier samples exhibiting ‘jumps’ in DNAm
beta-values of the order of 20–30% (Fig. 2d). We were able to
confirm this for the great majority of hypervariable DVMCs, with
the
outlier
samples
exhibiting
hyper
or
hypomethylation,
depending on the average beta-value in the normal samples
from
cancer-free
women
(Supplementary
Fig.
4).
Further
attesting to the importance of considering DV, DVMCs were
also highly robust to correction for variable adipose cell content
(Supplementary Fig. 5), indicating that these DVMCs mark
DNAm changes in the epithelial or stromal cell compartment of
the normal-adjacent samples. Analysing the distribution of
DVMCs according to specific gene regions, we observed that
among the hypermethylated DVMCs, hypervariable ones were
much more likely to map to regions within 1.5 kb upstream of the
transcription
start
site
(TSS),
whereas
hypovariable
ones
were more likely to map to the gene body (Fisher-test P-value:
Po1e-15, Supplementary Table 4), consistent with DNAm levels
in healthy normal cells starting out low near the TSS and high in
gene bodies. Among the hypomethylated DVMCs, hypervariable
ones
were
overrepresented
in
the
gene
body,
whereas
hypovariable ones mapped preferentially to the 50untranslated
region (Fisher-test P-value: Po1e-15, Supplementary Table 4),
again consistent with the baseline/normal levels of DNAm in
these regions being high and low, respectively.
We observed that the 42 normal adjacent samples exhibited
marked differences in the overall number of epigenetic alterations
at hypervariable DVMC loci, with only 2 samples exhibiting
alterations at more than 50% (that is, 2,031) of the loci (Fig. 2e).
The great majority of samples exhibited alterations at less than
5% of these loci (that is,o200). From the perspective of
individual DVMC loci, the overall frequency of alteration across
the 42 samples was also low, with the most frequently altered
CpG attaining significant hypermethylation in only 14/42 (33%)
of samples (Fig. 2f). The overwhelming majority of DVMCs
showed DNAm changes in only four to five normal-adjacent
samples, supporting the view that DNAm changes in the
normal-adjacent tissue are largely stochastic when assessed across
unrelated individuals (Fig. 2f). We confirmed, by Monte-Carlo
analysis, that the observed number of CpGs exhibiting the largest
frequencies of alteration were not higher than that expected by
random chance (Fig. 2f).
Although from the perspective of any one of the hypervariable
DVMCs, the field defects appear largely stochastic across different
women, it could be that normal-adjacent samples carrying a
higher fraction of field defects are associated with specific
tumour characteristics. To study this, we correlated the fraction
of
epigenetic
alterations
at
hypervariable
DVMC
loci
in
each normal-adjacent sample to a range of clinical characteristics
of the matched tumours, including estrogen receptor (ER)
progesterone receptor (PR) human epidermal growth factor
receptor 2 (HER2)
status, as well as age, tumour size, KI67,
stage, grade, nodal and menopausal status. A strong association

 was only observed for stage, with stage-2 tumours exhibiting a
significantly higher load of epigenetic changes at the hypervari-
able DVMC loci compared with stage-1 cancers (Supplementary
Fig. 6).
Validation of epigenetic field defects in an independent cohort.
To validate the identified field defects, we collected an indepen-
dent cohort of normal breast samples (n ¼ 18, obtained from
reduction mammoplasty) and normal samples adjacent to
invasive breast cancers (n ¼ 70), for which Illumina Infinium
450k DNAm data were available (Fig. 1d)18. We observed
that the top component of variation in this data set exhibited
an almost perfect correlation with our in-silico adipose cell
content estimate (Supplementary Fig. 7). For each sample
and hypervariable DVMC, we estimated whether it exhibited a
significant deviation in DNAm relative to the 18 normal samples,
adjusting for potential variation in adipose cell fractions. Of the
4,062
hypervariable
DVMCs
(3,173
hypermethylated þ 889
hypomethylated) from the discovery set, 4,047 (that is, over
99%) were present in this independent study, with 2,586 (64%)
exhibiting higher frequencies of alteration in normal-adjacent
samples compared with normal samples, with 22% not showing
any difference and with 14% exhibiting fewer alterations in
normal-adjacent samples, thus demonstrating that a substantial
fraction of the identified field defects are reproducible (Fig. 2g).
The normal-adjacent samples exhibited fractions of alteration at
the hypervariable DVMC loci, similar to the fractions in the
discovery set, and significantly higher than those of the normal
samples (Fig. 2h), allowing normal-adjacent from normal samples
to be discriminated with an area under the curve (AUC) of
0.84 (Fig. 2i).
Field defects exhibit progressive changes in breast cancer. If the
DNAm defects identified in the normal adjacent tissue mark cells
that are important for the development of breast cancer, we
would expect to see that these loci exhibit larger differences in
DNAm when comparing breast cancers (presumably enriched for
these
cells)
to
the
normal
samples
of
healthy
subjects.
To test this, we computed t-statistics of differential methylation
between the 305 breast cancers and the 50 normal samples from
healthy subjects, for all previously identified DVMCs. We
observed that the great majority of DVMCs exhibited significant
differential DNAm changes in breast cancer and that they
exhibited much stronger associations than a randomly selected set

Figure 1 | Overall analytic strategy for identifying and validating field defects in breast cancer. (a) Aim is to identify DNA methylation changes between
normal tissue from cancer-free women (N) and age-matched normal samples adjacent to breast cancers (NADJ). This is done correcting for variable adipose/
fat content across breast tissue samples and then performing a supervised analysis. (b) Two feature selection paradigms are possible: (i) a standard paradigm
by which we select differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) and which assumes homogeneity within the phenotypes being compared, (ii) a novel paradigm,
based on the notion of differential variability (DV), which allows for heterogeneous/stochastic changes, and which identifies differentially variable CpGs
(DVCs). Profiles to the left depict theoretical examples of a DMC and DVC. P-values are from a t-test for the case of assessing differential methylation (DM),
and from a Bartlett’s test for the case of assessing DV. Horizontal dashed lines indicate the mean DNA methylation value, vertical lines indicate the variance
(±1.96 standard deviation). To the right, we depict real examples of a top ranked DMC and DVC derived from comparing N to NADJ samples. We give the P-
values (P) and adjusted P-values (adjP: adjusted for multiple testing) for the case of t-tests (DM) and Bartlett’s test (DV). Horizontal dashed lines indicate the
mean DNA methylation value, vertical lines indicate the variance (±1.96 s.d.). Note that for the DVC, the main distinguishing feature is the variance, not the
mean. (c) The iEVORA algorithm posits that relevant field defects are identified by first using a test for DV to select significant DVCs, and then ranking
significant DVCs by a DM t-statistic. This results in differentially variable and differentially methylated CpGs (DVMCs). Those exhibiting increased variance in
the NADJ samples represent candidate field defects. (d) Validation of field defects using matched and unmatched breast cancer samples, to assess if field
defects progress or become enriched in the invasive cancer state, as well as validation of field defects in independent cohorts.

 of CpGs (Fig. 3a), clearly supporting the view that the identified
DVMCs are marking cells that progress to breast cancer. Among
all DVMCs, those hypervariable in normal adjacent samples
exhibited
the
correspondingly
strongest
changes
in
DNA
methylation in breast cancer (Fig. 3b), attesting to their special
importance in cancer development. A plot of the DNAm profile
of a representative DVMC in this class confirmed a pattern of
progressive DNAm change, with a much higher proportion
of breast cancers exhibiting increased deviations in DNAm from
the normal state (Fig. 3c).
To explore the patterns of progression in more detail,
we
compared
DNA
methylation
levels
of
representative
DVMCs within each of the 42 matched normal–tumour pairs.
DVMCs hypermethylated in normal adjacent tissue also exhibited
statistically significant increases in DNA methylation in the
matched breast cancers (Wilcoxon rank sum Paired test: Po1e-8,
Fig. 3d). Confirming the generality of this, we observed that up to
32%
of
the
hypervariable
and
hypermethylated
DVMCs
underwent further significant increases in DNA methylation in
breast cancer, in contrast to only 2% exhibiting a reversal in

 DNAm change (that is, hypomethylation; Fisher’s exact test,
Po1e-100, Fig. 3e). Thus, a substantial proportion of the DVMCs
hypermethylated in normal-adjacent tissue relative to the normal
samples of cancer-free women, continue to exhibit further
DNAm increases in the matched breast cancers. In contrast, the
2% of DVMCs exhibiting hypomethylation likely represent either
subclones whose relative representation in the breast cancer is
reduced or sites undergoing active DNA demethylation in cancer.
We note that none of the other three categories of DVMCs
exhibited as consistent patterns of progression in the breast
cancers as those of hypervariable and hypermethylated DVMCs
(Supplementary Fig. 8).
Convergence of DNA methylation defects in breast cancer.
Interestingly,
although
the
identification
of
hypervariable
DVMCs
was
driven
by
a
relatively
small
number
of
normal-adjacent samples exhibiting widespread deviations at
these loci (Figs. 2e and 3f), most matched breast cancer samples
exhibited increased DNAm deviations at the same CpGs.
To explore this further, we identified the ten normal-adjacent
samples that exhibited least DNAm changes at the identified
hypervariable DVMCs (Fig. 3f). The overwhelming majority of
the DVMCs did not exhibit any significant deviations in DNAm
across these ten samples (comparing to the 50 normal healthy
ones), with a relatively few loci exhibiting 1, 2 and 3 changes
(Fig. 3f). Remarkably, however, the ten breast cancers matched to
these normal-adjacent samples did exhibit significant DNAm
deviations at a large proportion of these same loci (Fig. 3g),
indicating that although these particular DNAm alterations
were not strongly represented in the normal-adjacent tissue,
that they did become enriched in the actual cancers. This suggests
that although the DNAm landscape of normal-adjacent tissue
is highly heterogeneous across different patients, that the
corresponding landscape in the paired breast cancers is more
homogeneous in the sense that any two breast cancers will share a
larger fraction of loci exhibiting significant DNAm deviations
from the normal state. Thus, although any two randomly selected
normal-adjacent samples differ substantially in terms of the
specific loci exhibiting significant DNAm deviations, any two
randomly selected breast cancers will share a higher fraction of
such loci (Supplementary Fig. 9A), consistent with our previous
observations in cervical cancer19. To formally test this again here,
we computed the Manhattan distance of significant DNAm
deviations
over
the
hypervariable
DVMCs
for
each
pair
of normal-adjacent samples, and then again for each pair of
matched breast cancers, comparing the resulting distances against
their corresponding null distributions obtained by randomizing
the deviation matrices (keeping the frequencies of alteration per
sample fixed, Methods). This confirmed that pairs of breast
cancers showed smaller Manhattan distances than random,
indicating
a
higher
than
random
overlap
of
DVMCs
undergoing
significant
DNAm
deviations,
whereas
the
Manhattan distance for normal-adjacent samples was more
consistent with that of a random distribution (Supplementary
Fig. 9B).
Field defects are present in breast ductal carcinomas in situ. We
would expect the identified field defects to also be present in
lesions that often precede invasive breast cancer. To test this, we
first obtained Illumina Infinium 450k data for an independent
cohort of 15 normal-adjacent and 40 ductal carcinomas in situ
(DCIS)
of
the
breast20.
Mapping
our
hypervariable
and
hypermethylated DVMCs in this data, we observed that these
sites exhibited substantial DNA methylation increases in DCIS
compared with normal-adjacent samples (Wilcoxon rank sum
test: Po1e-10, Supplementary Fig. 10). To further test this, we
obtained another independent set of 5 normal breast samples
(from reduction mammoplasias) and 24 high-grade pure DCIS
samples, for which reduced-representation bisulfite-sequencing
(RRBS) data were available21. Of the 3,173 hypervariable and
hypermethylated DVMCs, 983 had RRBS data (20-fold coverage)
within a 100-bp window on either side of the DVMC. Computing
the average deviation in DNA methylation for the DCIS samples
relative to the 5 normal samples over these 983 sites, we could
confirm that these DVMCs exhibited increased DNAm levels in
the DCIS (Wilcoxon rank sum test: Po1e-4, Supplementary
Fig. 11).
Field defects are enriched for gene regulatory elements. Having
established the existence of widespread DNAm field defects in
breast cancer, we next explored their distribution in relation to
regulatory
elements,
including
transcription
factor-binding
sites22,23. Using ENCODE/NIH Roadmap ChIP-Seq data for
binding sites in human embryonic stem cells22,24,25, we assessed
enrichment of 58 transcription factors among the four categories
of DVMCs. We only found enrichment among the hypervariable
and hypermethylated DVMCs (Supplementary Data 2), with the
top five transcription factors including two Polycomb Repressive
Complex 2 (PRC2) members (EZH2 and SUZ12) as well as
RBBP5, CTCF and RAD21. This is similar to the enrichments we
found previously in relation to smoking26 and ageing23. Plotting
the statistics of differential methylation between normal-adjacent
and normal tissue for all 450k probes mapping to EZH2- and
CTCF-binding sites, confirmed a statistically significant trend for
these sites to become hypermethylated in normal-adjacent tissue
(Fig.
4a–c
and
Supplementary
Fig.
12A–C).
Importantly,
EZH2-binding sites also exhibited progressive increases in
DNAm in breast cancer compared with normal-adjacent tissue
(Fig. 4d), and although this was also true for CTCF-binding sites,
the changes were more subtle (Supplementary Fig. 12D).
Examples

a
PRC2
target,
SOX17,
and

a
DNase
Hypersensitive region containing a CTCF-binding site upstream
of histone HIST1H4D illustrate the progressive DNAm increases
from normal to normal adjacent tissue to breast cancer (Fig. 4e
and Supplementary Fig. 12E). Gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) of DVMCs mapping to either the TSS1500, TSS200
or the first exon regions (regions containing 450k probes
which are most informative of gene expression27), confirmed
that the strongest enrichment of any biological term was for
hypervariable and hypermethylated DVMCs, which were strongly
enriched for bivalently or PRC2 marked genes (Hypergeometric
test: Po1e-40, Supplementary Data 3 and Supplementary
Fig. 13).
Coordinated field defects target the wingless related iNTegra-
tion (WNT)/fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signalling. Next, we
asked if the identified epigenetic field defects also target
specific gene modules or signalling pathways. To address this we
used a functional supervised algorithm, called FEM (Functional
Epigenetic Modules)27–29, which seeks hotspots of differential
promoter
DNA methylation
in the context of
a human
interactome. This revealed a number of significant hotspots of
epigenetic deregulation, centred around important breast cancer
genes, including FOXA2, PAX6 and L1CAM (Supplementary
Data 4), with the two largest modules mapping to the WNT and
FGF signalling pathways, respectively (Fig. 5a and Supplementary
Data 4). The promoters of many pathway members were
hypermethylated in normal-adjacent tissue relative to normal
tissue from cancer-free women, with most of these gene
promoters undergoing further progressive increases in DNA
methylation in the matched 42 breast cancers (Fig. 5b and
Supplementary Fig. 14). Within a signalling pathway, alterations

 in one pathway member in one normal adjacent sample were
usually accompanied by changes in other pathway members
within the same sample, indicating coordinated changes (Fig. 5b
and Supplementary Fig. 13). We confirmed, statistically, that
epigenetic changes in the normal adjacent tissue and within the
signalling pathway, generally, exhibited a level of coordination
(Supplementary Fig. 15 and Methods).
Enrichment level of field defects correlates with phenotype. We
reasoned that breast tumours highly enriched for cells marked by
epigenetic field defects would correspond to tumours with a
higher clonogenic potential, exhibit increased proliferation rates
and adverse outcome. To test this, we first estimated for each
breast cancer sample an enrichment or ‘progression’ Z-score,
which measures the average deviation in DNA methylation at
DVMC loci from the 50 normal-healthy samples (Methods). This
analysis was performed separately for the four categories of
DVMC loci considered earlier. First, we verified that these
progression scores were higher in cancer compared with normal-
adjacent tissue (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 16A). We note
that the scores exhibited stronger trends for the hypervariable
DVMCs supporting the biological significance of the hyper-
variability seen in the normal-adjacent samples (Supplementary

 Fig. 16A). In correlating the progression Z-scores of the breast
cancers to clinical tumour features, including ER, PR and HER2
status, as well as KI67, tumour size, age and clinical outcome, we
observed a significant positive association with proliferation
(KI67; Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 16B and Supplementary
Table 5), which was strongest for the hypervariable and
hypermethylated DVMCs. Interestingly, the score computed at
these specific sites also correlated significantly with tumour size
(Fig. 6c and Supplementary Table 5) and clinical outcome (Fig. 6d
and Supplementary Table 5). The association with survival
remained marginally significant in a multivariate model, which
included age, stage, ER-status and tumour size (Supplementary
Table 6). Similar results were observed had we used a progression
‘hit’ score estimated from counting the fraction of hypervariable
DVMC
loci
exhibiting
significant
deviations
in
DNAm
(Supplementary Table 7). Interestingly, we observed that the
association with outcome was stronger when we restricted to the
untreated subset, although significance was not reached due to
small sample size (Supplementary Fig. 17). We therefore tried to
validate the association of this progression score in an indepen-
dent set of untreated breast cancer patients from TCGA (The
Cancer Genome Atlas)30. Importantly, the only progression score
to validate in the TCGA was the one based on the hypervariable
and hypermethylated DVMCs, consistent with the results in our
cohort (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Table 8). Finally, we also
computed a personalized progression score, specifically, for each
of the 42 breast cancers relative to their matched normal-adjacent
tissue. Interestingly, for the hypervariable þ hypermethylated
DVMC class, we observed a significant association with HER2
status, indicating that breast cancers which exhibit stronger
progressive DNAm deviations from their normal-adjacent tissue
are more likely to be HER2 þ breast cancers (Fig. 6e and
Supplementary Table 9).
Discussion
Previous to this work, the frequency of epigenetic field defects in
breast cancer was largely unknown. Had we adopted a statistical
feature selection framework based on the common paradigm of
differential methylation, our genome-wide analysis would have
concluded, erroneously so, that there are no genome-wide
significant DNA methylation field defects in breast cancer.
However, motivated by our previous work in cervical cancer,
which points to a fundamentally stochastic nature underlying the
earliest of epigenetic changes16,17, we here hypothesized that a
feature selection paradigm based on DV would improve the
sensitivity to detect heterogeneous, stochastic, DNAm changes.
We further posited that these DNAm changes would mark cells in
the normal-adjacent tissue, which drive carcinogenesis. Indeed,
we have here shown how our novel statistical algorithm identified

 thousands of genomic sites, which exhibited increased variability
in DNAm within the normal-adjacent samples, compared with
normal breast tissue from age-matched cancer-free women. In
addition to validating these field defects in an independent
cohort, we have also demonstrated that the hypervariable
DVMCs exhibit progressive DNAm changes in the breast
cancers of the same women who provided a normal sample
adjacent to their tumours, clearly supporting the view that the
identified epigenetic field defects are marking early cancer
precursor cells, which become enriched in the invasive cancers.
Importantly, we have also shown that the DNAm changes
marked by the hypervariable DVMCs are not the result of
variations in adipose cell content, a potential major confounder in
these analyses. Although we cannot exclude for sure that some of
the DV may be driven by changes in the stromal compartment,
including variations in immune cells, this is highly unlikely for
the following reasons. First, the DNAm changes driving the DV
between the normal samples from cancer-free women and the
normal-adjacent samples involve beta-value changes typically on
the order of at least 20–30% (if not higher). As we have excluded
variations in fat/adipose cell content as causing these changes in
DV (despite the fact that changes in adipose cell content do carry
most of the correlative variation in the data), it is therefore highly
unlikely that changes in the stromal cell compartment could
account for these rather big changes (420–30%) in DNAm
between the two normal phenotypes. Second, the GSEA on
genomic
pathways
and
TFBS
did
not
reveal
any
strong
enrichment of terms or TFs which are specific to immune cells
or other stromal cells, suggesting that the DVMCs are not
markers of these cell types. Thus, the DV we observe is most
likely driven by changes in the epithelial cell compartment of the
breast tissues.
The epigenetic field defects we have observed represent
heterogeneous,
that
is,
infrequent,
events
across
the
42
normal-adjacent samples. This suggests that early epigenetic
events in breast cancer are marked by a stochastic component,
as
otherwise,
the
observed
frequency
of
alteration
in
normal-adjacent samples would have been much higher. On the
other hand, we have also clearly demonstrated that epigenetic
field defects do not happen randomly in the genome: binding sites
of transcription factors important in specifying chromatin
architecture, notably members of the PRC2 complex (EZH2,
SUZ12), CTCF and RAD21, were all observed to acquire DNA
methylation in normal cells adjacent to breast cancers, and to
exhibit even further DNAm increases in the actual cancer. A
system-level gene promoter analysis also confirmed that epige-
netic field defects are not entirely random, targeting specific gene
modules and signalling pathways, notably WNT signalling, a
stem-cell differentiation pathway which has been observed to be
epigenetically deregulated in other cancer types, including pre-
neoplastic lesions31–33. The results of an ordinary GSEA also
supported the role of WNT signalling, as well as FGF signalling,
with one of the most highly ranked terms by odds ratio
containing several genes previously implicated in mammary
tumorigenesis
and
mapping
to
both
of
these
pathways34
(Supplementary Table 4).
In summary, epigenetic field defects in breast cancer are
widespread. Although specific defects are infrequent and appear
largely stochastic across individuals, their genomic distribution is
highly non-random affecting binding sites of transcription factors
specifying chromatin architecture and stem-cell differentiation
pathways. As with genetic mutations, alterations in DNA
methylation also appear to mark pre-neoplastic normal cells that
later transform and become enriched in cancer.
Methods
Primary DNA methylation dataset. A total of 397 breast tissue samples were
collected within the Bavarian Breast Cancer Cases and Controls Study 2 (here
denoted as the Erlangen data set). This study was approved by the Ethics Com-
mittee of the Medical Faculty, Friedrich-Alexander University (Ref.No.4514) and
all patients gave written informed consent. The 397 samples included 50 normal/
benign tissue specimens from 50 healthy women, 42 matched normal-breast cancer
samples (normal samples being adjacent to the tumours, so a total of 84 samples)

 and 263 unmatched breast cancers. For sampling of adjacent normal and cancer
tissue, a minimal distance from the cancer margin to the area of the breast from
which the normal adjacent tissue was taken was 3 cm. Care was taken that the
normal areas represented macroscopically healthy breast tissue. The samples
(cancer and normal) were snap frozen and stored at � 80 �C. For DNA extraction,
sections (3 � 10 mm) of the fresh frozen tissues were done. Tumour tissues
contained 470% cancer tissue and no cancer tissue was present in adjacent
normal samples. DNA was extracted and processed following standard procedures
for the Illumina 450k DNA methylation beadarrays35. Demographic and clinical
details of the women and breast cancers are provided elsewhere (Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2).
Normalization of DNA methylation data. Raw Illumina data files were processed
with the minfi Bioconductor package36. Using the P-values of detection from this
package, we next estimated coverage of each sample and probe. All samples and
probes had reasonable coverage. P-values larger than 0.05 were assigned not
available (NAs) and later imputed using the impute.knn (k ¼ 5) function from the
impute Bioconductor package37. To adjust for the well-known bias of type-2
probes, we ran each sample through BMIQ38. This completed the intra-sample
normalization, resulting in a DNAm beta-valued data matrix of 485,512 probes and
397 samples. Inter-sample effects were assessed using a Singular Value
Decomposition approach, as implemented by us previously, to evaluate the relative
amounts of variation correlating with biological and technical factors39. Biological
factors (that is, normal/tumour status, grade) were prominent among the top
singular vectors with no major batch or chip effects causing potential confounding.
Data are available on GEO (accession number GSE69914, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo). We further note that although we did not remove the 93,382 cross-reactive/
polymorphic 450k probes of Chen et al.40, that we did test the robustness of all
results presented in this study against removal of such probes from our list of
DVMCs (see below).
Supervised analysis using the iEVORA algorithm. Owing to the more likely
stochastic nature of epigenetic changes in early pre-neoplastic lesions16,17, we
performed feature selection using a novel statistical algorithm based on the concept
of DV. Specifically, we developed a regularized version of the feature selection
procedure implemented in our previous EVORA (Epigenetic Variable Outliers for
Risk prediction Algorithm) algorithm16, called iEVORA. Briefly, we subjected each
CpG to a Bartlett’s test to identify those whose DNA methylation patterns are
differentially variable between the 50 normal samples and the 42 normal samples
adjacent to tumours. Those CpGs that passed a stringent FDRo0.001 threshold, as
estimated with the q-value Bioconductor package41, were designated differentially
variable CpGs (DVCs). Because Bartlett’s test is overly sensitive to single outliers,
we regularized the procedure by re-ranking DVCs according to their differential
DNA methylation t-statistic, and selecting those with a t-test unadjusted P-value of
less than 0.05. We call this subset of DVCs, differentially variable and DVMCs. The
top ranked DVMCs are differentially variable, but those with the larger t-statistics
are ranked highest, a procedure that penalizes DVCs driven by only a few outliers.

DVMCs and cross-reactive/polymorphic probes. Chen et al. identified a total of
93,382 cross-reactive/polymorphic 450k probes, which could result in unreliable
measurements. This constitutes about 19% of the total number of probes on the
Illumina 450k beadarray. We verified that among our list of 7,318 DVMCs, there
were only 923 overlapping with Chen’s list. This is far less than the number
expected to overlap by random chance (0.19 � 7,318 ¼ 1,407), indicating that our
DVMCs are underenriched for potentially problematic probes. This under-
enrichment was particularly strong for the hypervariable þ hypermethylated
DVMCs, as of the 3,173 of such DVMCs, only 208 were problematic, whereas by
random chance we would have expected up to 610 to be cross-reactive or
polymorphic. Thus, this confirms that DV is selecting biological features, in fact,
avoiding the selection of potentially problematic probes. We further note that all
analyses in this study were reproducible after removal of the 923 overlapping
crossreactive/polymorphic probes from our DVMC list.
Correction for intra-sample adipose cell content. As adipose/fat cells are known
to be a major component of breast tissue, we devised a statistical algorithm to
deconvolve the effects of contaminating fat cells. The algorithm uses Illumina 450k
DNAm reference profiles for human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) and
adipose tissue, which we obtained from ENCODE (GEO accession number
GSE40699)42 and an independent study profiling a number of different tissue types
(Slieker et al), including fat cells43. In all cases, 450k DNAm profiles were corrected
for type-2 probe bias using BMIQ38. In the case of the Slieker et al data, we verified
that clustering samples over the top principal components, segregated samples
according to tissue type. As there were multiple adipose tissue samples, we
averaged these to define an initial reference adipose cell DNAm profile. To
construct reference profiles for the deconvolution algorithm, we selected CpGs
according to two criteria: (i) an absolute difference in beta-value between the
HMEC profile and the averaged adipose one, 40.7, and (ii) that it mapped to a
DNAse hypersensitive site, as these sites are more likely to represent tissue-specific
markers22. This resulted in reference centroid DNAm profiles for HMEC and
adipose tissue, defined over 1,320 CpGs. Given an independent sample with a 450k
DNAm profile, we then estimated its proportional fat content using constrained
projection (CP)44. Although stromal cells are also present in breast tissue, we here
assume that this fraction is part of the estimated HMEC fraction. Thus, for any
given sample, w(HMEC) þ w(FAT) ¼ 1.
To validate our deconvolution algorithm, we collected Illumina 450k DNAm
data for independent adipose tissue samples from the Stem Cell Matrix
Compendium45. We also downloaded the ENCODE 450k DNAm data for a
normal breast cell lines (MCF10A) and a breast cancer cell-line (MCF7). As before,
all these data were corrected for type-2 probe bias using BMIQ. Weight estimates
for each samples were then obtained using CP. R-code implementing CP is
available under the filename ‘InferPropCP.R’ as Supplementary Software 2.
Demonstration of the stochasticity of DNAm field defects. For each
hypervariable DVMC and normal-adjacent sample, we estimated a z-statistic, by
comparing its DNAm beta-value to the average and standard deviation of the same
CpG across the 50 normal samples from cancer-free women. From the z-statistics,
one can then estimate a corresponding P-value. A binarized matrix was then
constructed using a P-value threshold of 0.001, so that entries with P-valueso0.001
were assigned a ‘1’ (representing a methylation hit), entries with P-values40.001
were assigned a ‘0’. This threshold corresponded roughly to a FDR of B0.05. For
each DVMC, we then estimated its frequency of alteration across the 42 normal-
adjacent samples. DVMCs that are more frequently altered than expected by
random chance would indicate that these sites are altered in a non-stochastic
manner. Thus, to assess this, we used a Monte-Carlo approach, whereby we
scrambled up the binarized data matrix (4,062 hypervariable DMVCs x 42 samples
with a total of 488,529 hits, that, 1’s, representing 30% of entries in the matrix) and
recomputed the expected null frequencies of alteration. Randomization was done
multiple times and finally compared the maximal null frequencies with the
maximal observed ones to assess whether any DVMCs exhibited more alterations
than expected by chance.
Comparison of the heterogeneity of DNAm patterns. We used a similar
approach to the one described in the previous paragraph to assess the degree of
heterogeneity of DNAm patterns in normal-adjacent tissue compared with breast
cancer. Specifically, we used the same binarized deviation DNAm data matrix
described above to estimate the fractional overlap of significant DNAm deviations
(across all 4,062 hypervariable DVMCs) between every pair of normal-adjacent
samples, as well as between every pair of matched breast cancers. So, this analysis
was restricted to the 42 women who provided both a normal-adjacent and breast
tumour specimen. In addition to the fractional overlap, we also estimated the
Manhattan distance between every pair of normal-adjacent samples, as well as
between every pair of matched breast cancers. To assess the statistical significance of
the overlaps and distances, we used a Monte-Carlo approach in which we randomly
permuted the DVMCs for each sample separately, recomputing the overlaps and
distances. A total of 1,000 Monte-Carlo runs were performed. The average overlaps
and distances were recorded for each run. The resulting null distributions were
observed to be very tight, resulting in the comparison of the mean of these null
distributions to the observed means for the observed (unpermuted) binary deviation
matrices. We note that this Monte-Carlo approach is important in order to adjust for
the inherently higher frequency of DNAm deviations exhibited by the breast cancer
samples compared with normal-adjacent tissue.
Functional epigenetic modules (FEM) algorithm and GSEA. To infer inter-
actome modules that represent hotspots of differential DNA methylation, we used
the interactome and procedure described by us previously27–29. Briefly, because we
did not have matched mRNA expression data, we applied the version of FEM that
only uses differential DNA methylation statistics (the EpiMod algorithm).
Specifically, the weights in the interactome network were constructed from
differential DNA methylation statistics between the 42 normal-adjacent samples
and the 50 normal samples from healthy subjects. All other parameters of the FEM
algorithm were run as done previously27–29. GSEA was performed using one-tailed
Fisher exact tests using the Molecular Signatures Database46. Fisher-test P-values
were corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamini Hochberg correction
procedure.
Construction of progression Z and personalized deviation scores. For each
category of DVMCs (hypervariable þ hypermethylated, hypervariable þ
hypomethylated, hypovariable þ hypermethylated, hypovariable þ
hypomethylated) and for each sample, we constructed a progression Z-score, as the
average Z-statistic over all CpGs in that category. Specifically, for a given CpG site
in a category of DVMCs, we first computed the Z-statistic of its DNA methylation
beta-value in sample s relative to the mean and standard deviation across all the 50
normal healthy samples. For the same sample s, we then averaged these Z-statistics
over all CpGs within a given DVMC category. Thus, for the hypermethylated
DVMC categories, larger positive Z-scores indicate average larger deviations from
the normal state, whereas for the hypomethylated DVMC classes, larger negative
Z-scores indicate stronger levels of hypomethylation relative to the normal state.

 In addition, for the 42 matched breast cancers, we also computed an
individualized deviation score as follows. Again, focusing on a specific category of
DVMCs, we computed the average deviation in DNA methylation beta-value
between the breast cancer sample and its corresponding matched normal-adjacent
sample, the average being computed over all CpGs within the DVMC class. Once
again, for the DVMC categories that are hypermethylated in normal-adjacent tissue
compared with normal samples, we would expect positive deviation scores for
those breast cancers that show further increases in DNA methylation compared
with their matched normal adjacent sample; conversely, for the hypomethylated
DVMCs, we would expect negative deviation scores for those breast cancers that
show further decreases in DNA methylation compared with their matched
normal-adjacent tissue.
Coordination versus mutual exclusivity analysis. To assess if the DNA
methylation changes between normal-adjacent and normal tissue, and within the
inferred functional epigenetic modules (from the FEM/EpiMod analysis), are
occurring in a coordinated or mutually exclusive fashion within a sample, we first
constructed a binary deviation matrix over all genes in the module and all 42
normal-adjacent samples. This matrix was constructed from the Z-scores estimated
previously, with P-values then estimated using a standard normal N(0,1) dis-
tribution. For P-valueso0.05, a given entry in the binary matrix was assigned a
value 1, otherwise a 0. The Manhattan distance was then estimated between all
pairs of genes in the module with at least 10% significant deviations (that is,
using only those rows/genes for which there were at least 4 (B0.1 � 42) 1’s). To
assess statistical significance of the average Manhattan distance, we performed an
independent permutation of samples for each row/gene, recomputing the average
null Manhattan distance. A total of 1,000 Monte-Carlo randomization were per-
formed to generate a null distribution for the average Manhattan distance.
Validation of epigenetic field defects. We obtained Illumina 450k DNA
methylation data for a cohort of 70 normal breast tissue samples collected adjacent
to invasive breast cancers, as well as of 18 normal samples from reduction mam-
moplasty18. The series matrix file was downloaded from GEO (GSE67919) and
processed with the same pipeline as the Erlangen set.
Ductal carcinoma in-situ data sets. We obtained two separate DNA methylation
data sets, described previously20,21. One data set profiled 15 normal-adjacent breast
tissues and 40 DCIS (breast carcinomas) with Illumina Infinium 450k data,
available from GEO (GSE66313)20. We downloaded the series matrix file and
processed the 450k data using the same pipeline as for the primary Erlangen set.
Another data set profiled 5 normal breast samples (from reduction mammoplasty
surgeries) and 24 DCIS (breast carcinomas) using RRBS. We downloaded the
normalized methylation fraction data matrix for 414,930 loci with at least 20-fold
coverage, available from GEO (GSE69994)21. Illumina 450k probes were mapped to
the RRBS data using a 200-bp window around the 450k probes: that is, methylation
fractions for RRBS loci within 100 bp on either side of an Illumina 450k probe were
averaged.
