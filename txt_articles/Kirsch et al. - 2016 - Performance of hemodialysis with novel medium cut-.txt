ABSTRACT
Background. Compared to high-flux dialysis membranes, novel
medium cut-off (MCO) membranes show greater permeability
for larger middle molecules.
Methods. In two prospective, open-label, controlled, random-
ized, crossover pilot studies, 39 prevalent hemodialysis (HD)
patients were studied in four dialysis treatments as follows:
study 1, three MCO prototype dialyzers (AA, BB and CC with
increasing permeability) and one high-flux dialyzer in HD; and
study 2, two MCO prototype dialyzers (AA and BB) in HD and
high-flux dialyzers in HD and hemodiafiltration (HDF).
Primary outcome was lambda free light chain (kFLC) overall
clearance. Secondary outcomes included overall clearances and
pre-to-post-reduction ratios of middle and small molecules, and
safety of MCO HD treatments.
Results. MCO HD provided greater kFLC overall clearance
[least square mean (standard error)] as follows: study 1: MCO
AA 8.5 (0.54), MCO BB 11.3 (0.51), MCO CC 15.0 (0.53) versus
high-flux HD 3.6 (0.51) mL/min; study 2: MCO AA 10.0 (0.58),
MCO BB 12.5 (0.57) versus high-flux HD 4.4 (0.57) and HDF
6.2 (0.58) mL/min. Differences between MCO and high-flux
dialyzers were consistently significant in mixed model analysis
(each P < 0.001). Reduction ratios of kFLC were greater for
MCO. Clearances of a1-microglobulin, complement factor D,
kappa FLC (jFLC) and myoglobin were generally greater with
MCO than with high-flux HD and similar to or greater than
clearances with HDF. Albumin loss was moderate with MCO,
but greater than with high-flux HD and HDF.
Conclusions. MCO HD removes a wide range of middle mole-
cules more effectively than high-flux HD and even exceeds the
performance of high-volume HDF for large solutes, particularly
kFLC.

INTRODUCTION
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) results in the retention of ure-
mic toxins, which is associated with high mortality [1]. Uremic
toxins are classified into small (<500 Da) and middle-
molecular (500 Da–60 kDa) water-soluble solutes and protein-
bound substances [1, 2]. While conventional hemodialysis
(HD) modalities remove small solutes and smaller-sized middle
molecules, clearance of larger middle molecules and protein-
bound substances is poor [3].
Studies have associated middle molecules to pathological fea-
tures of uremia, such as immune dysfunction and inflamma-
tion, as well as adverse outcomes in dialysis patients [4–8]. Free
immunoglobulin light chains (FLCs) have a molecular weight of
�22.5 and 45 kDa for kappa FLC (jFLC) and lambda FLC

(kFLC), respectively. Importantly, FLC levels have been associ-
ated with mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) cohorts
[9–11]. They can be considered larger middle molecules, insig-
nificantly removed by HD [4].
Thus, efforts have focused on improving the clearance of
larger middle molecules in dialysis. The introduction of more
water-permeable high-flux membranes allowed the clearance of
middle molecules such as b2-microglobulin [12, 13], and
increasing convection with hemodiafiltration (HDF) consider-
ably enhanced middle molecule clearance [14]. However, high-
flux dialyzers have cut-off values of �20 kDa [15] and are thus
limited in their ability to remove larger middle molecules,
including jFLC and kFLC which have molecular sizes exceed-
ing this threshold. Maintenance HD patients who are at high
mortality risk seem to benefit from high-flux HD [16–18].
However, large outcome trials comparing HDF to HD have
yielded equivocal results [19], with some secondary and retro-
spective analyses suggesting large convection volumes, which
correlate with enhanced removal of middle molecules, result in
more favorable outcomes [20–22]. This is, however, subject to a
possibly large degree of bias, since healthier patients with better
vascular access are likely to achieve better outcomes.
Medium cut-off (MCO) dialyzers utilize a novel class of
membranes designed to increase the removal of larger middle
molecules in HD [15] and, in contrast to more permeable high
cut-off (HCO) membranes, are intended for routine use in
maintenance HD patients. In the present two pilot studies, the
performance of three prototypes of MCO dialyzers differing in
membrane pore size were compared to HD and high-volume
HDF using contemporary high-flux dialyzers. The particular
focus was on the clearance of larger middle molecules, including
jFLC and kFLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
In two prospective, open-label, 4-arm, randomized, active-
control, crossover pilot studies, Theranova 400 dialyzer (MCO
AA; Gambro Dialysatoren GmbH, Hechingen, Germany, a sub-
sidiary of Baxter International Inc.) and two MCO dialyzer pro-
totypes (MCO BB and CC) used in HD were compared in
single, consecutive mid-week treatments to high-flux dialyzers
used in HD (FX CorDiax 80; Fresenius Medical Care
Deutschland, Bad Homburg, Germany; studies 1 and 2) and
high-volume HDF (FX CorDiax 800; Fresenius Medical Care
Deutschland, Bad Homburg, Germany; study 2) in a randomly
assigned order, respectively. The MCO dialyzer membranes had
increasing membrane permeability, i.e. AA < BB < CC [15].
Dialyzer membrane characteristics are described in Table 1.
Our choice to compare to FX CorDiax dialyzers was based on
their wide use in Europe and reports indicating they achieve sig-
nificantly greater middle molecule removal than other high-flux
dialyzers [23].
Study 1 was performed in the dialysis units of the Medical
University of Graz and the Hospital Hochsteiermark/Bruck/
Mur, both in Austria. Study 2 was performed in the Dialysis
Center Elsenfeld in Germany. The studies were conducted
according to the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by
local ethics committees and competent authorities. Both studies
are registered at clinicaltrials.gov (study 1: NCT02377570; study
2: NCT02377622).
In study 1, the dialysis sessions were 4 h long, with a dialysate
flow (QD) of 500 mL/min and a blood flow (QB) of 300 6 20
mL/min. In study 2, the dialysis sessions were 4–5 h long, with a
QB of 400 6 50 mL/min. The HDF sessions were performed in
post-dilution volume-controlled mode, with a target total con-
vective ultrafiltration volume of �23 L and the QD set at 700
mL/min. Since in online HDF, the effective QD is reduced by
the reinfusion rate, a QD of 600 mL/min was used for the three
HD sessions in study 2. In both studies, the ultrafiltration flow
rate was adjusted to reach dry weight.
At all study centers, the dialysis treatments were otherwise
based on current prescription and study protocol requirements.
Throughout the duration of the patients’ participation in the
study, any individual anticoagulant treatment was continued as
previously prescribed.
Patients
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided at clinicaltrials.

HDF treatment for �3 months before enrollment, and had a
jFLC/kFLC ratio of >0.37 and <3.1 and no history of mono-
clonal gammopathy. All patients provided written informed
consent.

lected and sent to a central laboratory under standardized

conditions. See Supplementary methods for detailed description
of sampling and analysis.
The overall clearance (Kovr) was calculated as [24]:
Kovr ¼ MD
AUC
where MD ¼ total mass removed and AUC ¼ area under the
plasma water concentration–time curve (calculated from sam-
ples taken before study treatments, at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min
into study treatments and at the end of study treatments, using
the linear trapezoidal rule) [25].
Total mass removed (MD) was calculated as:
MD ¼ CDS � ðQD � TD þ VUFÞ
where CDS ¼ dialysate solute concentration, QD ¼ programmed
dialysate flow rate, TD ¼ study treatment duration and VUF ¼
actual ultrafiltration volume.
Plasma water concentrations (CPW) were calculated as:
CPW ¼
CP
1 � 0:0107 � TP
where CP ¼ measured plasma concentration (corrected for
hemoconcentration [26]) and TP (in g/dL) ¼ the most recently
measured pre-study total plasma protein level.
Reduction ratio (RR) was calculated as:
RRð%Þ ¼
1 � CPost
CPre
�
�
� 100
where CPre and CPost ¼ measured plasma concentrations of the
solute before and at the end of study treatments, respectively.
For the middle molecules, CPost was corrected (CPost-corr) for
ultrafiltration, as follows:
CPost�corr ¼
CPost
1 þ
BWPre � BWPost
0:2
� BWPost
�
�
where BWPre and BWPost ¼ patient’s body weight before and at
the end of study treatments, respectively [27].
Randomization
Every patient received each study dialyzer treatment in
randomized order, which was assigned by a central computer-
based randomization in the form of Williams design sequences.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the kFLC Kovr of the MCO dia-
lyzer prototypes used in HD mode, compared to high-flux dia-
lyzers used in HD and HDF. Secondary outcomes were the
clearance of other middle molecules and small molecules, as
well as safety (albumin removal and treatment tolerance) of
MCO HD.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were performed using SAS statistical analysis soft-
ware [SAS, SAS/GRAPH, SAS/STAT; version 9.2 of SAS for
Windows (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA)]. Treatment
effects were evaluated using a two-sided significance level of
0.050.
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included all patients
who received at least one study treatment. The ITT full analysis
set included all patients who received at least one MCO HD
treatment and one treatment with either high-flux dialyzer.
Analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy end points used
the ITT full analysis set.
When a laboratory value for any of the efficacy end points or
for the safety analysis of the MD of albumin was below the lower
limit of detection (LLOD), an imputed value of LLOD/�2 was
used.
For the primary analysis of the kFLC Kovr, the mean within-
patient difference in Kovr of kFLC between HD with each MCO
dialyzer prototype and either HD or HDF was analyzed using a
mixed model that included fixed effects of period, study dialyzer
type and the random effect of subject.
The null hypothesis was that there was no difference in the
kFLC Kovr between HD with any MCO dialyzer and treatment
with either high-flux dialyzer. The corresponding alternative
hypothesis was that there was a difference in the Kovr.
The secondary efficacy end points were analyzed using the
same mixed model.

Free light chain removal during HD using medium
cut-off dialyzers compared to a high-flux dialyzer
Compared to high-flux HD [least square mean (standard
error) 3.6 (0.51) mL/min], the kFLC Kovr during HD was signif-
icantly higher (P < 0.001) with MCO AA [8.5 (0.54) mL/min],
BB [11.3 (0.51) mL/min] and CC [15.0 (0.53) mL/min], respec-
tively. Similarly, the jFLC Kovr was significantly higher [MCO
AA 26.2 (1.24) mL/min, BB 31.8 (1.17) mL/min and CC 37.3
(1.24) mL/min], compared to high-flux HD [3.3 (1.17) mL/min;
P < 0.001] (Figure 1A).
Accordingly, HD treatments with MCO AA, BB and CC
achieved significantly higher (P < 0.001) RR for kFLC [42.5
(2.06)%, 47.6 (2.06)% and 51.5 (2.10)%, respectively], compared
to high-flux HD [12.9 (2.10)%]. Likewise, a significantly higher
(P < 0.001) RR for jFLC was obtained with MCO AA, BB and
CC [66.3 (1.85)%, 68.4 (1.85)% and 70.4 (1.88)%, respectively],
compared to high-flux HD [36.4 (1.88)%] (Figure 1B).
Free light chain removal during HD using medium
cut-off dialyzers compared to high-flux HD and HDF
Similarly to study 1, in study 2, the mean kFLC and jFLC
Kovr during HD were again significantly greater (P < 0.001)
when using MCO AA or BB, as compared to high-flux HD
(Figure 2A). Importantly, also when compared to HDF, HD
with MCO AA and BB showed significantly higher Kovr of both
kFLC [10.0 (0.58) mL/min and 12.5 (0.57) mL/min versus 6.2
(0.58) mL/min, respectively; each P < 0.001] and jFLC [35.0
(1.43) mL/min and 39.4 (1.39) mL/min versus 25.4 (1.43) mL/
min, respectively; each P < 0.001] (Figure 2A). Accordingly,
kFLC RR during HD with MCO AA and BB were superior to
kFLC RR achieved during HDF [48.1 (1.72)% and 52.7 (1.72)%
versus 37.9 (1.76)%, respectively; P < 0.001) (Figure 2B). There
was no difference between jFLC RR achieved during HD with
MCO AA and that during HDF [72.9 (1.35)% versus 71.6

tically significantly higher jFLC RR [74.8 (1.35)%; P ¼ 0.01]
(Figure 2B).
Removal of other middle molecules during HD
and HDF
In study 1, the MCO dialyzers achieved significantly higher
mean Kovr of other middle molecules, such as a1-microglobulin,
complement factor D (CFD), myoglobin and b2-microglobulin,
compared to high-flux HD (Table 4). There was also a small, yet
significant, increase in the mean phosphate (P < 0.001) and
urea (P ¼ 0.02) Kovr, whereas there was no difference in creati-
nine Kovr with any of the MCO dialyzers.
Study 2 confirmed the findings on MCO HD versus high-flux
HD. Compared to HDF, the removal of the larger-sized solutes
was significantly greater with MCO HD. This was also true for
Kovr of b2-microglobulin, whereas RR for b2-microglobulin was
slightly lower with MCO AA, compared with HDF (Table 5).
Albumin removal during medium cut-off HD
In study 1, there was a moderate, but larger, total mass of
albumin removed with MCO AA [median 2.9 g (range 1.5–
3.9)], BB [4.8 g (2.2–6.7)] and CC HD [7.3 g (1.9–9.7)], com-
pared to high-flux HD [0.2 g (0.2–0.2)].
In study 2, albumin removal with MCO AA [median 3.2 g
(range 1.9–3.9)] and BB HD [4.9 g (1.1–7.2)] was higher, com-
pared to high-flux HD [0.2 g (0.2–0.3)] and HDF [0.4 g (0.3–
0.8)], respectively.

Adverse events (AEs) were recorded during a 7-day period

In study 1, 11 patients (58%) experienced at least one AE; a
total of 23 AEs were comparably distributed between the study
dialyzers. One patient withdrew from the study due to fistula
thrombosis before receiving any study treatment. The only AE
occurring in more than one patient was muscle cramps, which
were observed in two patients (11%) during treatment with the
MCO AA and CC dialyzers and the FX CorDiax 80 dialyzer,
and in one patient (5%) during treatment with the MCO BB
dialyzer. None of the AEs was considered possibly, or likely to
be related to an investigational product and there were no seri-
ous AEs.
In study 2, 11 patients (55%) experienced at least one AE;
there were a total of 31 AEs, the rate of which was again similar
with the dialyzers used. One patient experiencing mild vomit-
ing, dyspnea and nausea during his first study HD session with
the MCO BB dialyzer withdrew from the study. Two serious
AEs occurred in study 2, both requiring intradialytic hospital-
izations (pulmonary edema and collapse not related to the study
treatments). The only AEs occurring in more than one patient
were headache in two (11%) patients treated with the MCO AA
dialyzer and dyspnea in two (10%) patients treated with the
MCO BB dialyzer. Six AEs were considered possibly, or likely to
be related to an investigational product, which occurred in one
patient treated with HD with the MCO BB dialyzer and one
patient treated with HD with the FX CorDiax 80 dialyzer (each
had three events).
There were no significant differences in pre- and post-
treatment hematology parameters among the studied dialyzers
in either study (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Current HD techniques provide limited removal of large middle
molecules. Even high-volume HDF, considered to be the most
efficient in terms of middle molecule clearance [28], allows lim-
ited removal of solutes larger than b2-microglobulin, is not uni-
versally available and cannot be performed in all patients [29].
The results of the present two studies provide a detailed
characterization of the performance of a novel class of dialysis
membranes, which allows middle molecule removal that, at the
very least, rivals high-volume HDF. The main objective was to
compare the kFLC Kovr during MCO HD to that with high-flux
dialyzers in HD and HDF. jFLC (22.5 kDa) and kFLC (45 kDa)
are relatively large middle molecules that are considered uremic
toxins. Higher FLC levels interfere with neutrophil function and
may thus predispose to infections [4]. Also, higher kFLC levels
have been associated with high mortality in patients with and
without CKD [10, 30–32]. While greater clearance by HDF has
been found for jFLC and, to a lesser extent, for kFLC, in com-
parison with high-flux HD, the pre-dialysis levels were not
reduced [33, 34]. It has also been shown that certain adsorptive
membranes may allow the removal of FLCs [35, 36]. Clearly,
more research is needed to understand the role of FLCs in dialy-
sis patients.
Study 1 compared HD treatments using three MCO proto-
types to HD using a contemporary high-flux dialyzer. All three
prototypes of the MCO dialyzer tested removed significantly
more middle molecules, compared to the control treatment,
across a wide molecular size range examined, as shown by higher
Kovr and/or RR for b2-microglobulin (11.8 kDa), myoglobin (17
kDa), jFLC (22.5 kDa), CFD (24 kDa), a1-microglobulin (33
kDa), YKL-40 (40 kDa) and kFLC (45 kDa). Importantly, HD
using the most restrictive of the MCO dialyzer prototypes tested
resulted in increased kFLC removal, which was the primary out-
come of this study. This was shown by a >2-fold increase in
mean kFLC Kovr and a >3-fold increase in kFLC RR. Thus, at a
QB of 300 mL/min, the MCO membrane allowed significantly
greater middle molecule removal, compared to high-flux HD,
without the prerequisites for high-efficiency HDF such as the
online production of substitution fluid and high QB.
Increased filtration in modern high-flux membranes consid-
erably increases the removal of smaller middle molecules, com-
pared to conventional membranes [16]. HDF further improves
middle molecule removal, compared to HD, using current
high-flux membranes [20]. Recently, HDF using large convec-
tive volumes has been speculated to lead to improved outcomes
in maintenance dialysis patients [21]. Some retrospective data
and secondary analyses suggest a dose-dependent effect of mid-
dle molecule removal, since favorable outcomes were reported
from studies using large convective volumes [20, 21]. A recent
retrospective study in incident dialysis patients found an inverse
relationship between convective volume (i.e. enhanced middle
molecule removal) and mortality; however, these observations
may be biased [37].
In study 2, HD treatments with the MCO AA and BB proto-
types were compared to high-flux HD and high-volume HDF
with a set total convective volume of 24 L at a QB of 400 mL/
min. Again, both MCO dialyzers removed jFLC and kFLC
more efficiently than high-flux HD and HDF. MCO AA and BB
HD also achieved significantly greater Kovr and RR for other
larger middle molecules such as a1-microglobulin, CFD and
myoglobin. A slightly higher RR for b2-microglobulin was
achieved with HDF, underlining that MCO HD more efficiently
removes larger middle molecules in particular.
Increasing pore sizes, while permitting clearance of larger
uremic toxins, bears the trade-off of the leaking of larger mole-
cules such as albumin [38]. Excessive albumin loss can lower
serum albumin levels in maintenance dialysis patients and is a
theoretical limitation to the long-term use of highly permeable
dialyzers [39].
During HD with the MCO dialyzer prototypes AA, BB and
CC in study 1, there was a median loss of albumin of 2.9, 4.8
and 7.3 g per treatment session, respectively. In spite of these
differences in albumin loss among the individual MCO dia-
lyzers, the tightest membrane in the MCO AA dialyzer already
achieved significantly improved FLC clearance, compared to
both high-flux HD and high-volume HDF. Also, the albumin
loss obtained with the MCO AA dialyzer was within the range
observed in HDF treatment with high-flux dialyzers [40, 41],
below transperitoneal albumin losses seen in peritoneal dialysis
[42, 43] and less than a third of what has been reported for HD
with HCO membranes [44]. Continuous 2-week treatment with
HCO HD has been shown to lead to a modest decrease in serum
albumin, without clinical symptoms of hypoalbuminemia, and
a concomitant rise in serum cholinesterase activity, indicating

increased hepatic albumin synthesis [44]. Whether long-term
treatment with MCO HD has any clinically significant effect on
serum albumin levels will have to be examined in future studies.
However, the MCO AA dialyzer may be considered to have the
most attractive benefit–risk profile of the MCO dialyzers
studied, although its long-term effects on serum albumin clearly
require further study. Based on these data, it is reasonable to
speculate that MCO HD, which may remove larger solutes not
only convectively by internal filtration, but also considerably by
diffusion [45], may expand the benefits of high-efficiency HDF
to a larger number of patients. It even allows the removal of
larger uremic toxins not previously targeted by current mainte-
nance HD technology.
Besides the novel membranes studied here, the presented
data provide for the first time a unique characterization of HD
membrane clearance for an extensive size range of middle mole-
cules of between 11.6 and 45 kDa. The albumin loss during
high-flux HD and HDF in this study was lower than in some
previous reports [41, 46]. However, it should be pointed out
that these studies were conducted using different less tight
membranes, compared to the ones present in the control dia-
lyzers used in this study.
Dialysis fluid quality is a potential safety concern when using
more permeable membranes. However, experimental data indi-
cate that adsorption is the main mechanism for retention of
bacterial products to synthetic membrane materials [47] and
in vitro data indicate that, for polyarylethersulfone (PAES)/pol-
yvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) membranes, permeability is not a
decisive factor for endotoxin retention [48].
A limitation of our study is that the Kovr only includes trans-
membrane removal and does not take into account any poten-
tial adsorption to the membrane. However, as conclusions
drawn from the RR of middle molecules are very similar to
those from Kovr measurements, adsorption of middle molecules
to the studied membranes does not appear to be a major con-
tributor to their overall removal. Other limitations are that this
study design was confined to only one single treatment with
each dialyzer for each patient and the study did not examine the
long-term effects of such membranes on serum levels of middle
molecules and albumin.
CONCLUSION
MCO HD removes a wide range of middle molecules more
effectively than high-flux HD, with the trade-off of increased
albumin removal, compared to high-flux HD and HDF. MCO
HD also exceeds the performance of high-volume HDF for
larger middle molecules, particularly kFLC. Importantly, MCO
HD can be applied to maintenance HD patients, in whom high-
volume HDF may not be used or is not available. Future studies
should assess whether the performance of MCO HD improves
outcomes.
