Abstract: Although short (up to 3 days) exposure to major shifts in macronutrient intake appears
to alter acid–base status, the effects of sustained (>1 week) interventions in elite athletes has not
been determined. Using a non-randomized, parallel design, we examined the effect of adaptations
to 21 days of a ketogenic low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) or periodized carbohydrate (PCHO)
diet on pre- and post-exercise blood pH, and concentrations of bicarbonate [HCO3−] and lactate
[La−] in comparison to a high carbohydrate (HCHO) control. Twenty-four (17 male and 7 female)
elite-level race walkers completed 21 days of either LCHF (n = 9), PCHO (n = 7), or HCHO (n = 8)
under controlled diet and training conditions. At baseline and post-intervention, blood pH, blood
[HCO3−], and blood [La−] were measured before and after a graded exercise test. Net endogenous
acid production (NEAP) over the previous 48–72 h was also calculated from monitored dietary intake.
LCHF was not associated with significant differences in blood pH, [HCO3−], or [La−], compared
with the HCHO diet pre- or post-exercise, despite a significantly higher NEAP (mEq·day−1) (95%
CI = (10.44; 36.04)). Our results indicate that chronic dietary interventions are unlikely to influence
acid–base status in elite athletes, which may be due to pre-existing training adaptations, such as an
enhanced buffering capacity, or the actions of respiratory and renal pathways, which have a greater
influence on regulation of acid–base status than nutritional intake.

1. Introduction
Low carbohydrate high fat (LCHF) diets have previously been implemented in the context of
epilepsy treatment [1,2] and as a weight loss strategy [3,4]. More recently, however, there has been
a re-emergence of interest in their potential role in sports nutrition, with claims that adaptation
to restricted carbohydrate (CHO) intake and high levels of circulating ketone bodies by trained
individuals achieves significant changes in substrate utilization during sub-maximal exercise, to
shift reliance from glycogen utilization to the relatively unlimited stores of body fat [5]. Indeed,

both early [6] and more recent [7–9] studies have shown that sustained (3 weeks to several years)
exposure to such a diet causes these robust shifts in exercise fuel use. However, beneficial effects on
performance remain unsubstantiated, with reports of maintained capacity for submaximal cycling
under fasted conditions in well-trained cyclists [6], but a reduction in exercise economy and failure to
improve 10,000 m race performance following a block of intensified training in elite race walkers [9],
in comparison to a more traditional diet providing high CHO availability [10]. A third approach
to nutrition support for endurance sport is the periodized CHO diet, which integrates strategies to
achieve high CHO availability to support key training sessions with protocols for low CHO availability
to enhance adaptive responses to selected lower intensity sessions [11]. This redistribution of CHO
intake to target the individualized goals of each training session has been shown to alter substrate
utilization during submaximal exercise [12], and to produce performance benefits in sub-elite [11,13],
but not elite [9,14] athletes. Thus, it appears that sports performance is determined by factors other
than a simple change in substrate utilization.
One of the less well-studied effects of sustained manipulations of the macronutrient composition
of the diet is the alteration in acid–base status. Diets high in fat can increase blood acidity, attributed to
the stimulation of lipolysis, and the release of acidic ketone bodies [4]. A small number of studies have
investigated the effects of short-term dietary modifications on acid–base status and exercise capacity
in healthy but essentially untrained individuals [15–18]. For example, measurement of pre-exercise
blood pH and bicarbonate concentrations after an overnight fast showed that three days of a low
(<10% energy intake) CHO diet was associated with a reduction in blood alkalinity, compared with a
high (>65% energy) CHO diet [15]. Other studies by the same group confirmed the effect of various
macronutrient concentrations. After a three-day high-protein (24% total energy intake), high fat diet
(73% total energy intake) [17], and a three-day low-carbohydrate diet (4% total energy intake) [16], pre-
and post-exercise blood pH and blood bicarbonate concentrations decreased, compared with a high
carbohydrate diet. While these results indicate modifications of acid–base status after acute alterations
in dietary macronutrient intake, and potentially a separate and additional contribution to changes in
exercise capacity, the effects have yet to be determined for sustained dietary interventions, particularly
in athletic populations.
Acid–base status has primarily been investigated in terms of the deleterious health implications
of metabolic acidosis [19–22]. Damage to bone and muscle can occur when additional calcium is
excreted in response to the excess of protons, and adverse effects, such as kidney stones, can be
caused by a reduced urine pH, a further compensatory mechanism against acidosis [23,24]. Small
changes to acid–base status place substantial stress on the body’s buffering mechanisms [23,25], and
one contributing factor is the composition of the diet [26]. It is acknowledged that normal metabolism
incorporates many reactions that produce and consume acids and bases, and that acid–base status is
routinely corrected by a tightly controlled acid–base regulatory system. The discrepancy between the
acid and base forming reactions due to dietary intake is, however, the primary contributing factor
toward net endogenous acid production (NEAP) [25].
NEAP can be calculated via validated equations [26,27]. One widely used method focuses on the
consumption of protein and potassium, quantified over a 24 h period [26]; since protein is a sulfuric
acid precursor, and potassium ingestion results in bicarbonate formation, the two dietary components
have a substantial influence on acid production [26]. Another more comprehensive estimation of
acid–base status involves more variables, including the intake of protein and specified micronutrients
(potassium, phosphate, magnesium, and calcium) over 24 h, body surface area (which affects acid
excretion rates), and established intestinal absorption rates of different dietary components [27].
Several previous studies have estimated acid production due to short-term (7 days or less) dietary
interventions [15–18,28,29] using a similar principle to the two approaches described, but NEAP has
not been calculated for sustained dietary interventions. NEAP calculations could potentially provide
an indication of the effect of different dietary regimes on acid–base status, particularly when combined
with direct measures of acid–base status, such as blood pH. There are potential implications for athletes’

performance, given that an increased alkalosis or buffering capacity can improve performance, and a
reduction in blood or muscle pH can be detrimental to high-intensity exercise performance [30,31].
Furthermore, differences in acid–base status between athletes and untrained individuals have been
reported, associated with differences in buffering capacity [32,33].
The goal of the current study was to fill gaps in our current knowledge on the longer-term changes
in acid–base status associated with diets that have been shown to alter blood pH and bicarbonate
concentrations when followed for short periods. In particular, we wanted to investigate the effects of
adaptation to a sustained ketogenic diet or periodized carbohydrate availability on such markers before
and after exercise in elite athletes, and whether NEAP calculations of endogenous acid production
were able to predict or explain any changes. Therefore, our aims were to determine the effect of
adaptations to two sustained dietary interventions of current interest to endurance athletes (a LCHF
diet and a periodized carbohydrate availability diet [9]) on blood bicarbonate concentration, blood pH,
and blood lactate concentration (pre and post exercise), and net endogenous acid production (NEAP).
2. Materials and Methods
A non-randomized parallel groups study design was used to determine the effect of three
sustained (3 week) dietary interventions (a control high CHO diet—HCHO; low carbohydrate high
fat diet—LCHF, and periodized carbohydrate availability diet—PCHO) on acid base balance, at
rest, and following a graded exercise test in national and international level race walkers (Figure 1).
Acid–base status was measured via capillary blood samples, which were analyzed for blood pH, blood
bicarbonate [HCO3−] concentration, and blood lactate [La−] concentration. Furthermore, calculations
were undertaken to determine net endogenous acid production (NEAP) of the diets from dietary
records kept over the 48 h prior to each exercise test. These measurements were conducted at two
timepoints: baseline (prior to any intervention and with participants following a self-chosen diet), and
post-testing (after a three-week dietary and training intervention, during which all food was provided
to participants and consumed under supervision). The study was part of a larger research project,
conducted during a residential training camp held throughout January and February 2017 at the
Australian Institute of Sport (AIS; Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia). All participants
gave their written informed consent for inclusion, prior to their participation in the study. The study
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was approved by the
AIS Ethics Committee (Project Approval Code: 20161201).

2.1. Participants
Twenty-eight participants volunteered for this study, with twenty-four participants completing
all testing (Table 1). Two males and one female were unable to complete the requirements due
to injury, and one male was unable to provide a full data set for the baseline testing due to their
delayed arrival at the training camp. The cohort consisted of elite race walkers, competitive at
international or national level (mean ± SD International Association of Athletics Federations points
= 1130 ± 52) [34] who participated in a large dietary intervention study conducted at the Australian
Institute of Sport with the support of Athletics Australia (further details are provided by Burke et al.,
submitted for publication).The study included participants from Australia, New Zealand, Poland,
United Kingdom, South Africa, Lithuania, Canada, United States of America, Chile, Hungary, Japan,
and Spain. A sample size estimation performed for the larger study, based upon outcome measures
associated with performance and substrate utilization from recent research from our group with a
similar cohort, indicated that eight participants per group would be required to detect physiological
differences [9]. Participants were assigned to one of the two dietary intervention groups (LCHF or
PCHO), or the HCHO control group, according to their preferred dietary intervention.

2.2. Training Intervention
Athletes followed a supervised and monitored training program across a three-week period
of intensified training (Table 2). Of the ~12 weekly training sessions, six involved mandatory and
supervised group sessions of race walking. There were two long sessions of ≥20 km, a track session
involving sustained high-intensity 1-km repetitions on a 6-min cycle, a 14-km hill training session
(change in elevation ~285 m), and two low–moderate intensity “recovery” sessions, while two
resistance training and three hydrotherapy sessions were completed. The athletes could modify
their remaining sessions, undertaking them as additional race walking sessions, or substituting with
cross training, such as swimming or cycling. All athletes recorded their daily training in standardized
training logs.

2.3. Dietary Intervention
All meals were prepared by chefs, according to standardized recipes, and were consumed by
participants in a group environment, under the supervision of registered sports dietitians, according
to a previously established practice [32]. For baseline testing, participants were able to choose freely
from items provided as a buffet-style menu at the AIS Dining Hall, and were assisted to weigh
and record all of their food intake during this period, using calibrated food scales (SJ-5001HS, A&D
Weighing, Australia). Once the dietary intervention commenced, participants were provided with
all meals and snacks according to their intervention group (PCHO or LCHF, or HCHO) with menus
being individualized to BM and training load (to provide an energy availability of ~40 kcal·kg−1
lean BM; LBM), and specific dietary requirements including food allergies, intolerances, and dietary
preferences. Each athlete could request an increase or decrease in the quantities of foods or drinks
provided according to hunger, changes in training load, or fluctuations in BM. Such variations were
accommodated by adhering to the macronutrient composition of that individual’s treatment group.
During this period, all food intake was weighed prior to consumption, with allowances made for
unfinished portions or additional snacks chosen from a menu-specific list, as per food diary logs.
Energy and nutrient intake provided by the diets was calculated from a food analysis database specific
to Australian foods (Foodworks Version 9, Highgate Hill, Australia) by the same registered dietitian.
Full details of the methodology for creating, providing, and recording food intake can be found
elsewhere [35].
The three dietary interventions were chosen to represent different approaches to the support of
high volume training programs [9].
-
HCHO: traditional sports nutrition guidelines promoting high carbohydrate availability for all
training sessions: CHO: ~8 g·kg−1 BM, 60–65% energy intake; protein: ~1.8 g·kg−1·day−1 15–20%
energy; fat: ~20% energy intake [10].
-
PCHO: contemporary approach to sports nutrition, with same energy and macronutrient
composition as HCHO, but manipulated across and between days to provide high CHO
availability for key training sessions and low CHO availability for other sessions [11,36].
-
LCHF: popular ketogenic low CHO high fat diet: CHO: <50 g·day−1, protein: ~1.8 g·kg−1·day−1
15–20% protein, and 75–80% fat [6,34].
2.4. Exercise Testing
All participants completed a graded maximal exercise test at the baseline and post-testing
timepoints, under controlled laboratory conditions. All participants conducted each test in a fasted
state. The test was performed on a custom-built, motorized treadmill (Australian Institute of Sport,
Canberra, Australia). The test was comprised of four submaximal stages (for determination of
submaximal VO2 and walking economy). Each stage, three minutes in length, was immediately
followed by an incremental ramp to exhaustion for determination of VO2peak. As such, the total
test duration was approximately 13 to 20 min, depending on a participant’s time to exhaustion (TTE).
The treadmill velocity for the first stage was dependent on each participants’ most recent 10 km
race time (9–12 km·h−1), at 0% gradient, with the velocity being increased by 1 km·h−1 with each
subsequent stage. After each stage, a small (5 microlitres; µL) capillary blood sample was taken from
the fingertip, to measure blood [La−] (Lactate Pro, Arkray, Kyoto, Japan). Immediately following the
completion of the fourth submaximal stage (approximately equivalent to 20 km race-walk speed),
the gradient of the treadmill was increased by 0.5 degrees every 30 s, until the participant reached
volitional exhaustion. Heart rate (Polar heart rate monitor, Polar Electro, Kempele, Finland) was
measured throughout the test. Expired ventilation samples were collected continuously throughout
the test, using a custom-built open-circuit indirect calorimetry system (Australian Institute of Sport,
Canberra, Australia). The system was calibrated prior to each test [37].
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 236

Prior to starting the maximal exercise test, 100 µL of capillary blood was collected from the
fingertip. The hand was first immersed in warm water for ~1 min to increase blood flow to the area,
and then the fingertip was pierced using a sterile retractable lancet (Accu-Check, Roche, Sydney,
Australia). Blood samples were immediately analyzed for blood pH, blood [HCO3−], and blood [La−]
using a portable blood-gas analyzer (i-STAT, Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA), which was calibrated prior to
testing, in accordance with manufacturers guidelines. The blood sampling and analysis procedure was
repeated 2, 4, and 6 min after the completion of the maximal exercise test.
2.5. NEAP Calculations
The NEAP of dietary intake preceding the baseline and post-testing timepoints was calculated
from the participant’s dietary records. Mean values were used to account for any fluctuation in
dietary intake across days, and incorporated as much dietary information as was possible. Therefore,
for baseline testing, values were determined from the mean intake recorded for the previous 48 h
(the time between participants arriving at the training camp and the commencement of their dietary
intervention), and post-testing calculations were taken from mean intake over the previous 72 h
(the final three days of their supervised dietary intervention). Several published algorithms were
used to estimate NEAP. These included two equations established by Frassetto et al. [26] which use
daily protein and potassium intake, and one further equation developed by Remer and Manz [27],
which incorporates daily protein, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, and calcium intake, as well as
anthropometric measurements. The three equations used are listed below.
1.
Estimated NEAP (mEq·day−1) = (0.91 × protein (g·day−1)) − (0.57 × potassium (mEq·day−1)) +
21 [26] (NEAPF1).
2.
Estimated NEAP (mEq·day−1) = (54.5 × protein (g·day−1)/potassium (mEq·day−1)) − 10.2 [26]
(NEAPF2).
3.
Estimated NEAP (mEq·day−1) = Potential Renal Acid Load (PRAL) (mEq·day−1) + Estimated
Urinary Organic Anions (OAest) [38]. Within Equation (3), PRAL is calculated as: (mEq·day−1) =
0.488 × protein (g·day−1) + 0.037 × phosphorous (mg·day−1) − 0.021 × potassium (mg·day−1) –
0.026 × magnesium (mg·day−1) –0.013 × calcium (mg·day−1), whereby: OAest (mEq·day−1) =
(0.007184 × height0.725 × mass0.425) × (41/1.73) (NEAPR) [27].
2.6. Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed with a general linear mixed model using the R package lme4 (R Core
Team, Vienna, Austria) [39]. A random intercept for participants included interindividual homogeneity.
All models were estimated using restricted maximum likelihood. Visual inspection of residual plots
did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality. p-Values were obtained
using Type II Wald F tests with Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom as implemented in the R package
car [40]. Results for all variables (blood pH, blood [HCO3−], blood [La−], NEAP) are reported as
mean estimates and 95% confidence intervals. Initial models included all possible interactions, but
non-significant interaction terms were dropped from the models for ease of interpretation.
3. Results

Participants’ pre-intervention VO2max was 57.6 ± 4.6 mL·kg·min−1 BM for HCHO, 58.1 ± 3.3 mL
for PCHO and 61.1 ± 5.3 for LCHF. Post-intervention, VO2max was 58.3 ± 4.1, 60.2 ± 3.8, and
63.4 ± 4.1 mL·kg·min−1 BM, respectively. Within each of the three groups, there was a significant

3.2. Blood pH
At baseline, there were no differences in blood pH between HCHO, PCHO, and LCHF, at any
timepoint (F(2,20.97) = 0.86; p = 0.44), and as expected, there was a significant decrease in blood
pH from pre-exercise to all post-exercise timepoints for all groups (F(1,144.10) = 8.64; p = 0.003).
Post-intervention, there were no significant differences between groups at the pre-exercise collection
(95% CI = (−0.03; 0.05) and (−0.01; 0.07) for HCHO and PCHO, compared to LCHF, respectively),
but at the 2 min post-exercise timepoint, pH was significantly lower for PCHO compared with LCHF
(95% CI = (−0.16; −0.04)), with no significant difference between HCHO and LCHF (95% CI = (−0.11;
0.01)). Similarly, at 4 min and 6 min post-exercise, pH was significantly lower for PCHO compared
to LCHF (95% CI = (−0.15; −0.04) and (−0.15; −0.03), respectively), with no significant difference
between HCHO and LCHF (95% CI = (−0.10; 0.02) and (−0.08; 0.04), respectively) (Figure 2).

4. Discussion
This is the first study to investigate the effects of sustained manipulation of macronutrient intake
on acid–base status in elite athletes. The main finding of this investigation was that substantial
restriction of dietary carbohydrate intake with a ketogenic low carbohydrate high fat diet over a
three-week period had no influence on resting or exercise-associated blood indices of acid–base status,
despite changes in the calculated net endogenous acid production of the diet. While it is plausible that
this may be an anomaly that is specific to the training status and its effect on muscle buffering capacity
of elite athletes in this study, it may also reflect the neutralization or expulsion of dietary acids through
the respiratory or renal pathways.
The findings of this study contrast with earlier investigations, where low carbohydrate high fat
diets were associated with decreased resting blood pH and blood [HCO3−] [15–17]. However, there are
several important differences between our study and those conducted previously. Our study involved
elite athletes, most of whom had represented their countries at World Championships, Olympic
Games, and International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) World Cup events, whereas
the participants in previous studies were healthy but untrained [15–17]. Furthermore, the dietary
intervention was applied for 21 days in the present investigation, in comparison to acute (three or
four-day) interventions [15–17], potentially affording sufficient time for acids to be neutralized by
blood and tissue buffer systems, or eliminated through the respiratory or renal systems [25]. Finally,
unlike previous studies, a high level of control was imposed in the current investigation, with dietary
intake being individually prescribed and consumed under supervision of qualified dietitians [32].
Race walking competitions require sustained efforts at high velocities [41], and athletes maintain
a high percentage of maximal heart rate throughout races [42]. High-intensity training sessions are an
important component of race walkers’ training programs [42,43], and include 1 km (~4 min) and 2 km
(~8.5 min) repetitions performed close to race pace, plus hill sessions [43]. Indeed, evidence of the
intensity of several of the weekly training sessions in the current study was provided by observations
of post-exercise blood lactate concentrations as high as 19.2 mmol·L−1 after the prescribed session
of 1 km repetitions. Such training sessions are likely to contribute to highly adapted buffering
capacities, particularly within skeletal muscle, among the race walkers in this study [44,45]. Indeed,
the buffering capacity in athletes is typically more adapted than in untrained individuals [32,33],
which may explain why we did not observe any post-intervention differences in resting acid–base
status between participants in the LCHF and PCHO or HCHO groups, despite elevations in ketone
body concentration (typically sustained at ~1 mmol·L−1) in the LCHF group (Burke et al.; submitted
for publication). Furthermore, it is likely that the well-developed buffering capacity of the athletes
was evident prior to the start of the study, rather than specifically improving over the course of the
study as a result of the intensified training that was performed, given that no differences between
baseline and post-intervention sub-maximal exercise blood lactate concentrations were observed.
 Nutrients 2018, 10, 236

There is some evidence from other approaches to modifying acid–base status in elite athletes that
buffering capacity is already robust, and perhaps already able to cope with their regular exposure
to perturbations associated with high-intensity exercise. Indeed, among the few studies specifically
examining responses to supplementation with extra-cellular buffering agents, such as bicarbonate
or citrate, in elite athletes across different exercise modalities [46,47], the improvements in exercise
capacity or performance normally observed in modestly trained or lower caliber athletes [48] are
not detected.
While some differences in post-exercise blood pH were evident as a consequence of sustained
macronutrient manipulation, this may merely reflect differences in work capacity.
Specifically,
post-exercise blood pH was lower, while blood [La−] was higher following PCHO, compared with
LCHF. However, the PCHO group in this study performed more work during the post-intervention
graded exercise test, with a mean test duration of 17.6 min for PCHO, compared with 15.8 min for
LCHF, and race performance was impaired in the LCHF group (Burke et al., submitted for publication).
Similar suppression of blood [La−] associated with impaired work capacity has been reported in elite
athletes of a similar caliber and training status to the current study [9].
In this study, we observed a higher post-intervention NEAP with LCHF, compared with both
PCHO and HCHO. The fact that a similar trend was not observed in either post-intervention blood
bicarbonate concentration or blood pH, despite evidence of increased ketone body concentration
(Burke et al.; submitted for publication), which can contribute to acidosis [4] in the LCHF group,
may provide indirect evidence of well-developed blood buffering capacity of the elite athletes in the
present study. This observation suggests that NEAP calculations may have little applicability to highly
trained athletes.
One limitation of this study is that the results are specific to our participant population, where
the sample size was limited both by the resources needed to undertake the investigation and, by the
definition of elite, to a small sub-group with special characteristics. Future research is warranted,
whereby NEAP and direct measures of acid–base status are monitored after dietary interventions in
different participant populations, with a similar level of rigor applied to the dietary control to that
implemented in the current investigation. A controlled environment, such as that involved in the
current investigation may lead to an alteration in dietary intake from usual choices [49], and an increase
in the day-to-day variability of NEAP. Indeed, the self-chosen diets at baseline in the present study
showed a greater range than the prescribed diets, even when consumed from the same menu options.
Nevertheless in terms of adequately testing hypotheses around this topic, dietary standardization
is important [49]. A further limitation of the current investigation was that 24 h urinary net acid
excretion (NAE) was not included in the measures taken. It is acknowledged that the collection of
NAE allows more accurate estimations of NEAP than equations based on dietary constituents [50],
however, it was not feasible to collect 24 h urine samples in the current study. Future investigations
may incorporate the direct quantification of NEAP via the measurement of NAE, or if resources
are constrained, 24 h pH may be investigated since it reasonably correlates with, and explains the
variability in, 24 h NAE [27,51].
5. Conclusions
Our results indicate that sustained manipulation of macronutrient intake is unlikely to influence
acid–base status in elite athletes. Thus, any performance implications of a ketogenic low carbohydrate
high fat diet are unlikely to result from perturbations in acid–base status, a system which is tightly
regulated via the interaction of the blood and tissues, plus respiratory and renal systems. Finally, the
implications of sustained manipulation of dietary carbohydrate on NEAP may be best assessed via the
criterion 24 h urinary net acid excretion (NAE) method, over indirect NEAP calculations, in highly
trained athletes.
