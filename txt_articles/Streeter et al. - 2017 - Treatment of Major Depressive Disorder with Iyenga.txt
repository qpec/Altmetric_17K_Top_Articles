Abstract
Objectives: The aims of this study were to assess the effects of an intervention of Iyengar yoga and coherent
breathing at five breaths per minute on depressive symptoms and to determine optimal intervention yoga dosing
for future studies in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD).
Methods: Subjects were randomized to the high-dose group (HDG) or low-dose group (LDG) for a 12-week
intervention of three or two intervention classes per week, respectively. Eligible subjects were 18–64 years old
with MDD, had baseline Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores ‡14, and were either on no antide-
pressant medications or on a stable dose of antidepressants for ‡3 months. The intervention included 90-min
classes plus homework. Outcome measures were BDI-II scores and intervention compliance.
Results: Fifteen HDG (Mage = 38.4 – 15.1 years) and 15 LDG (Mage = 34.7 – 10.4 years) subjects com-
pleted the intervention. BDI-II scores at screening and compliance did not differ between groups ( p = 0.26).
BDI-II scores declined significantly from screening (24.6 – 1.7) to week 12 (6.0 – 3.8) for the HDG
(–18.6 – 6.6; p < 0.001), and from screening (27.7 – 2.1) to week 12 (10.1 – 7.9) in the LDG (–17.7 – 9.3;
p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between groups, based on response (i.e., >50% decrease in
BDI-II scores; p = 0.65) for the HDG (13/15 subjects) and LDG (11/15 subjects) or remission (i.e., number of
subjects with BDI-II scores <14; p = 1.00) for the HDG (14/15 subjects) and LDG (13/15 subjects) after the
12-week intervention, although a greater number of subjects in the HDG had 12-week BDI-II scores £10
( p = 0.04).

 Conclusion: During this 12-week intervention of yoga plus coherent breathing, depressive symptoms declined
significantly in patients with MDD in both the HDG and LDG. Both groups showed comparable compliance and
clinical improvements, with more subjects in the HDG exhibiting BDI-II scores £10 at week 12.

Introduction
M
ajor depressive disorder (MDD) is common, recur-
rent, chronic, and disabling. Due in part to its preva-
lence, depression is globally responsible for more years lost to
disability than any other disease.1 Up to 50% of individuals
treated with antidepressant medications for MDD do not
achieve full remission.2 Thus, the currently available treat-
ments for depression do not effectively or sufficiently reduce
the associated morbidity or mortality.3 To reduce the burden of
MDD, more effective and adjunctive therapies are needed.
Yoga-based therapies offer promise as both monotherapies
and adjunctive treatments. A meta-analysis and a review of
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using yoga as a treat-
ment for depression found that yoga was significantly better
than usual care, relaxation exercises, and aerobic exercise.4,5
One RTC that demonstrated positive results employed Iyen-
gar yoga, and assessed symptom reduction using the Beck
Depression Inventory, similar to the intervention and as-
sessment used in this study.6
In disorders with low parasympathetic tone (as measured
by low heart-rate variability [HRV]), such as MDD, yoga-
based interventions are associated with symptomatic im-
provement.7 Slow breathing exercises have also been linked
to increased HRV and improved mood.8 In subjects with
MDD treated with resonant breathing (coherent breathing
with pursed lips resistive exhalation) at 4.5–6.5 breaths per
minute (bpm), HRV increased and mood improved.9
Therefore, the objectives of this study were to assess the
effects of an intervention combining Iyengar yoga and co-
herent breathing on depressive symptoms in subjects with
MDD, and to determine the optimal dose of the yoga in-
tervention for future RTCs.
Materials and Methods
Instruments and data management
This study was approved by the Boston University Medical
Center (BUMC) Institutional Review Board. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants during the screening
interview. The screening and intervention occurred at BUMC
from October 2013 to September 2015. Subjects were recruited
from the Internet and local advertisements. The randomization
code was generated using a permuted block design (n = 4). The
randomization numbers and group assignments were kept in
sealed envelopes, numbered sequentially, and opened in se-
quence when a subject was randomized. Mood scales were
self-completed by subjects, such that unblinded research staff
did not administer mood scales. The Structured Clinical In-
terview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) was used to
diagnose presence of Axis I Disorders.10 The Beck Depression
Inventory-II (BDI-II), a 21-item, self-completed questionnaire,
was used to track depressive symptoms with the following
scoring: severe depression 29–63, moderate depression 20–28,
mild depression 14–19, and minimal depression 0–13.11 Other
mood scales completed will be reported elsewhere. The
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) was used
to assess suicide risk.12 Timeline Follow Back was used to
determine alcohol consumption for the 3 months prior to
screening.13 Study data were collected using Research Elec-
tronic Data Capture (REDCap).14
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
The study began with the following inclusion criteria: 18–
55 years old; current diagnosis of MDD; BDI-II score ‡14 and
<28 at screening; comorbid anxiety disorder(s) were allowable
if they would not interfere with participation. The following
were exclusionary: treatment with antidepressants, benzodi-
azepines, or mood stabilizers prior to screening; psychother-
apy for depression in the 3 months prior to screening; more
than six 1 h mind–body practices in the last 6 months; a current
prayer practice >2 h a week; bipolar illness; history of psy-
chosis; suicide attempt throughout lifetime or suicidal ideation
within the last year; current alcohol or substance abuse or
dependence; and inability to complete the study protocol.
After enrolling 16/32 subjects, it was determined that the
criteria were unnecessarily restrictive. Therefore, inclusion
criteria were expanded: upper age limit to 65 years; BDI-II
upper limit of 28 removed; subjects taking a stable dose (no
change in the amount) of antidepressants for at least 3 months
prior to screen if no anticipated dose changes during the
study. Exclusion criteria were also expanded: suicide at-
tempts within the prior year instead of lifetime; and to allow
suicidal ideation without intent, but to exclude suicidal ide-
ation with intent in the prior year using C-SSRS criteria.
Yoga plus coherent breathing intervention
The manualized Iyengar protocol developed by the authors’
group was modified such that the Iyengar posture protocol was
followed by a period of relaxation transition to a coherent
breathing exercise to enhance the potential benefit to individu-
als with MDD.6 The yoga component emphasized backbends
and inversions because the Iyengar method identifies these
postures as useful for treating depression.15 During relaxation
transition, subjects performed ujjayi breathing, which creates a
small resistance to airflow by slight contraction of the laryngeal
muscles with partial closure of the glottis, activating vagal af-
ferents (originating in the larynx and pharynx), while also acti-
vating vagal afferents by breathing against a resistive load.16
Coherent breathing entails gentle breathing through the nose
with equal duration of inhalation and exhalation at a respiratory
rate that optimizes HRV and sympatho-vagal balance by
breathing at an average rate of 5 bpm for most adults.8 Data on
the changes in HRV will be reported elsewhere.
The 90-min yoga classes consisted of approximately 60min
of yoga postures and approximately 10min of transition that
included deep relaxation (savasana) and ujjayi breathing
202
STREETER ET AL.
 (which helps control and slow the breath rate),16 followed by
20min of coherent breathing. Subjects were given the option to
continueujjayi duringcoherentbreathing.Acompactdisc(CD)
of two chime tones was played to pace the coherent breathing
with instructions to breathe in on the high tone and out on the
low tone. The 12-week yoga intervention was comprised of 11
unique sequences. The first 10 sequences were done for 1 week
each, and the 11th sequence extended over a 2-week period.
Each homework assignment consisted of 15min of postures
and 15min of CD-paced coherent breathing. The posture
homework was guided byweeks 2,4,and11ofthe manual. The
BDI-II was completed at screening and weeks 4, 8, and 12.
All yoga classes followed an established progression: se-
ated or reclining postures for centering while the sutra
translation and interpretation for that class were read; Sun
Salutations; standing poses; twists, transition poses; inver-
sions; deep relaxation (shavasana and ujjayi); and coherent
breathing. Ujjayi breathing was reviewed at the beginning of
each class and during the transition period. The names of the
postures in English and Sanskrit and sequences for each week
are provided in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 (Supplemen-
tary Data are available online at www.liebertpub.com/acm).
This intervention used the following props per participant:
a yoga mat, two yoga blocks, a yoga belt, a bolster (6 in-
ches · 12 inches · 24 inches), and three yoga blankets. For at
home practice, each subject was given the intervention
manual, a yoga mat, a 15-min CD for pacing home-breathing
practice, and two yoga blocks.
To determine the optimal dose of yoga, subjects were
randomized to a high-dose group (HDG) or a low-dose
group (LDG) for 12 weeks. The HDG consisted of three 90-
min yoga classes and four 30-min homework sessions per
week. The LDG consisted of two 90-min yoga classes and
three 30-min homework sessions per week. Subject com-
pliance was monitored by sign-in sheets at each yoga class,
and through weekly forms assessing compliance with
homework. A rolling admissions design was employed to
accommodate the scheduling requirements of imaging ses-
sions. Subjects entered the 12-week protocol as they were
randomized.
Yoga teacher training and considerations
All yoga instructors had passed the Iyengar Introductory
Level II certification exam, requiring ‡2 years of study, ac-
quiredatleast5yearsteachingexperience,andreceivedtraining
to modify yoga postures to accommodate each participant’s
balance, strength, and flexibility using posture modification,
prop utilization, and sequence modification within the estab-
lished progression of poses. Classes were divided among five
yoga instructors. They participated in manual development,
attended staff meetings throughout the study to maintain pro-
tocol fidelity, and taught the classes by the manual. The PI
completed written fidelity assessments of each instructor’s ad-
herence to the protocol throughout the study.
Statistics
Study data were analyzed using Stata/SE v13.1 (Stata
Corp., College Station, TX).14 Unadjusted bivariate analyses
used Fisher’s exact test for categorical data and two-sample
t-tests for continuous data. Generalized estimating equations
(GEE) were used to analyze correlated longitudinal data
from repeated measures on subjects across time.17 p-Values
derived for all statistical comparisons and power analyses
were two-tailed, using an alpha of 0.05 for statistical sig-
nificance. Cohen’s d was used to estimate effect sizes, and
confidence intervals were calculated.
Results
Recruitment and demographics
Telephone screening yielded 265 subjects of whom 86
participated in a screening visit, 32 were randomized, with
30 completers (Fig. 1). Completers participated in the
screening and evaluations at weeks 4, 8, and 12, except one
HDG subject who did not complete the 8-week evaluation.
In addition to MDD, subjects met criteria for the following
Axis I anxiety disorders: eight post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) current, one PTSD in full remission, four PTSD
subthreshold, three panic disorder in partial remission, one
panic disorder in full remission, and one current social
phobia. No subjects were excluded for anxiety disorders.
There were no significant differences between the HDG
(n = 15; Mage = 38.4 – 15.1 years) and LDG (n = 15; Mage =
34.7 – 10.4 years) on demographic variables (Table 1).
Fisher’s exact test between HDG and LDG was statistically
non-significant for marital status ( p = 0.84), employment
( p = 0.66), and race ( p = 0.30).
Yoga dose, compliance, and depressive symptoms
The assigned classes and homework (prescribed dose), the
performed postures or breathing (time in minutes), and the
compliance (performed/assigned) for yoga classes, postures
homework, breathing homework, total homework, and total
yoga time for HDG and LDG are listed in Table 2. The HDG
had a significantly higher dose of yoga, measured by number
of classes ( p = 0.001), total homework ( p = 0.05), and total
minutes ( p = 0.001). Two-sample t-tests comparing compli-
ance in classes, homework, and total yoga minutes across
groups were not statistically significant, consistent with both
groups being comparably compliant with the protocol. Fide-
lity assessments documented that yoga instructors were
compliant with the protocol.
As shown in Table 3 and Figure 2, BDI-II scores declined
significantly from screening to week 12 in the HDG (–18.6 –
6.6; t = –10.9; df= 14; p < 0.001; Cohen’s d = –2.81; 95%
confidence interval [CI] -22.3 to -14.9) and from screening to
week 12 in the LDG (–17.7– 9.3; t = –7.3; df= 14; p < 0.001;
Cohen’s d = –1.89; 95% CI –22.8 to –12.5). A two-sample t-
test comparing BDI-II scores from HDG and LDG at screening
was not statistically significant (t = –1.16; df= 28; p = 0.26),
indicating no difference in the severity of depression between
groups prior torandomization.BDI-II scores bygroup and time
are provided in Table 3.
Changes in BDI-II scores and cumulative yoga minutes
by group during the intervention are illustrated in Figure 2.
A GEE regression model with BDI-II scores as the depen-
dent variable and cumulative yoga minutes as the indepen-
dent variable demonstrates negative regression coefficients,
consistent with increasing total yoga minutes being in-
versely correlated with decreasing BDI-II scores in the LDG
(b = –0.006; z = –3.68; p < 0.001) and the HDG (b = –0.001;
z = –1.01; p = 0.31). A t-test comparing the BDI-II change

203
 scores between groups was not statistically significant (t =
–0.32; df = 28; p = 0.75). The combination of significantly
greater total yoga minutes in the HDG with no increased
difference in the change in BDI-II score makes the estimate
regression coefficient smaller, consistent with a lack of
statistical significance for the GEE in the HDG.
A two-sided Fisher’s exact test comparison showed the
following statistically non-significant differences between
groups from screening to week 12 in the proportion of re-
sponders (>50% decrease in BDI-II; 87% of HDG [13/15]
and 73% of LDG [11/15]; p = 0.65), and remitters (BDI-II
scores <14 at week 12; 93% of HDG [14/15] and 87% of
LDG [13/15]; p = 1.00). Statistically significant differences
in BDI-II scores £10 were found at week 12: 93% of HDG
(14/15) and 53% of LDG (8/15; p = 0.04). Two subjects who
were on a stable dose of antidepressants (venlafaxine and
bupropion) had BDI-II scores that decreased from screening
(38 and 16) to week 12 (14 and 9), respectively.
Adverse events
Adverse events were assessed weekly using subject-
completed adverse event forms and by a physician or clinical
psychologist using an adverse event form at weeks 4, 8, and
12. No serious adverse events were associated with the yoga
protocol. The most common adverse event clearly related to

 the intervention, reported in 13 subjects, was transient muscle
soreness. Weekly adverse event sheets, subject reports of
difficulties to staff, or staff observation triggered clinical
evaluations. No subjects developed suicidal ideation during
the study, and no subjects were withdrawn from the study.
Two randomized subjects, one from each group, stopped at-
tending classes and were lost to follow up prior to the 4-week
evaluation. By the end of the study, two subjects had chosen
to start psychotherapy, and none started antidepressants. Two
subjects continued to meet the criteria for severe and mod-
erately severe depression at end of the study, based on BDI-II
scores at screening of 40 and 22 and at week 12 of 33 and 23,
respectively. Although they still met the criteria for depres-
sion, both subjects stated that the intervention had been
helpful and that they intended to continue classes. Because
one subject in the HDG reported distressing thoughts while
practicing coherent breathing alone at home, homework was
changed for this individual to 30 min of postures with no
coherent breathing, which reportedly alleviated the distress.
Discussion
Although the HDG received a statistically significantly
greater dose of yoga minutes (measured in yoga classes,
homework, and total yoga minutes) compared with the
LDG, there was no significant difference in response (>50%
reduction in BDI-II scores) or remission (BDI-II scores <14)
rates between the groups from screening to week 12.
However, more HDG subjects had BDI-II scores <10 at
week 12, demonstrating less depressive symptomatology.
Results indicate that both groups completed sufficient in-
tervention minutes to improve rates of remission and re-
sponse significantly, but that the higher dose may be more
effective in reducing BDI-II scores to <10.
These findings are consistent with a previous yoga study by
the authors’ group,18 in which subjects with no history of
psychiatric illness completed an average of two classes and
one homework session per week, which was associated with
significant improvements in mood and decreased anxiety in
yoga subjects in both within group analyses and in compari-
son to a walking control group. The dose in the previously
published study is similar to the dose of the current LDG.
Drug dosing is based on drug half-life, the time required for
a substance to decrease by half. Similarly, it is possible that
the yoga intervention in the present study has a half-life of
48 h, such that an intervention dosed at three times a week
(e.g., two classes plus one homework session) would be suf-
ficient to improve mood symptoms. Although the subjects in
both groups were compliant, those in the HDG reported that
three weekly classes entailed a demanding time commitment,
as did subjects who declined to participate in the study due to
the time commitment. Considering the similar response and
remission rates, the lighter schedule of the LDG may better
balance effective intervention frequency with time demands.
The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali described eight limbs of
yoga.19 Treatment trials often include limb 3 (postures/
asanas), limb 4 (breathing exercises/pranayama), limb 6
(concentration/dharana), and limb 7 (meditation/dhyana).
According to Patanjali, postures, breathing, and concentra-
tion precede meditation as a way to prepare the body and
mind to sit without distraction. Given that symptoms of
depression include impaired concentration, this study pro-
vided subjects with concrete activities on which to focus in
the form of postures and breathing exercises, thereby in-
cluding components of concentration.

TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION WITH YOGA: A DOSING RCT
205
 The quality of the intervention was strengthened by (1)
use of a treatment manual, (2) rigorous training and certi-
fication for yoga instructors, including ongoing study with
the same teacher during this trial, (3) participation of in-
structors in developing the yoga treatment manual, (4)
training in coherent breathing and use of a CD for pacing,
and (5) fidelity assessments of yoga instructors’ adherence
to the protocol.
The results of this study must be interpreted with caution in
the context several limitations, for example the small sample
size and lack of an active non-yoga control (both groups
received Iyengar yoga plus coherent breathing). Also, the
supportive group environment and multiple subject interac-
tions with research staff each week could have contributed to
the reduction in depressive symptoms. Accordingly, a larger
RCT with a walking comparison group is underway. This
study enrolled subjects with MDD who had a low risk of self-
injury under the supervision of trained clinicians. Thus, the
results cannot be generalized to MDD with more acute sui-
cidality or more severe symptoms. This intervention was not
designed to be a substitute for the evaluation and treatment of
depression by trained professionals.
No subjects who were on antidepressant medication changed
their medication during this study. The two subjects on anti-
depressant medication were depressed at screening and im-
proved over the course of the intervention. This provides
preliminary support for the use of yoga-based interventions as
an adjunct to pharmacologic treatment for depression. Com-
pared with psychotropic augmentation of antidepressant medi-
cation, this intervention has the advantages of avoiding
additional drug side effects and drug–drug interactions. A larger
group of patients on antidepressant drugs would be needed to
validate this observed augmentation effect.
Conclusions
This dosing study provides evidence that participation in an
intervention composed of Iyengar yoga and coherent breathing
is associated with a significant reduction in depressive symp-
toms for individuals with MDD, both on and off antidepressant
medications. The HDG and LDG showed no significant dif-
ferences in compliance or in rates of response or remission.
Although the HDG had significantly more subjects with BDI-II
scores £10 at week 12, twice weekly classes (plus home
practice) may rates of response or remission. Although the
HDG, thrice weekly classes (plus home practice) had sig-
nificantly more subjects with BDI-II scores £10 at week 12, the
LDG, twice weekly classes (plus home practice) may con-
stitute a less burdensome but still effective way to gain the
mood benefits from the intervention. This study supports the
