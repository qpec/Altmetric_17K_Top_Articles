We investigated whether in utero exposure to maternal pregravid obesity and/or gestational diabetes mellitus
(GDM) was associated with early puberty in girls. We used data from a longitudinal study of 421 mother-daughter
pairs enrolled in an integrated health services organization, Kaiser Permanente Northern California (2005–2012).
Girls aged 6–8 years were followed annually through ages 12–14 years. Onset of puberty was assessed using study
clinic-based Tanner staging. We examined associations of self-reported pregravid obesity and maternal GDM with
timing of the daughter’s transition to pubertal maturation stage 2 or above for development of breasts and pubic hair,
using accelerated failure time regression models with interval censoring to estimate time ratios and hazard ratios
and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Maternal obesity (pregravid body mass index (BMI; weight (kg)/
height (m)2) ≥30) was associated with a daughter’s earlier transition to breast and pubic hair stage 2+ in comparison
with girls whose mothers had pregravid BMI <25. These associations were attenuated and not statistically sig-
nificant after adjustment for covariates. Girls whose mothers had both pregravid BMI ≥25 and GDM were at higher
risk of an earlier transition to pubic hair stage 2+ than those whose mothers had neither condition (adjusted
time ratio = 0.89, 95% confidence interval: 0.83, 0.96; hazard ratio = 2.97, 95% confidence interval: 1.52, 5.83).
These findings suggest that exposure to maternal obesity and hyperglycemia places girls at higher risk of earlier
pubarche.

A trend towards earlier onset of puberty has been observed
among girls in the United States over the past few decades (1–
3). In a 2013 study, Biro et al. (3) found that white girls ex-
perienced breast development (thelarche) 4 months earlier
than those in a study published only 15 years before (2). In
addition, the proportion of 6-year-old African-American
girls who had already begun to develop breasts or pubic hair
increased 2- to 3-fold (4). Early puberty is associated with
adverse health outcomes for girls and women over the life
course, including obesity, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance,
metabolic syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and cancer
(5–10).
Early-life determinants of the timing of pubertal matura-
tion are not well known. Sexual developmental events in fe-
males involve maturation of the ovaries (gonadarche) and the
adrenal gland (adrenarche) through 2 hormonally distinct
processes (11). Thelarche (first budding of breasts) is often
one of the indications of gonadarche, and pubarche (first ap-
pearanceofpubichair)oftenfollowsadrenarche.Theseevents
are part of a continuum that begins during intrauterine life
and extends through the completion of sexual maturation. It
is therefore likely that early-life factors play important roles
in the programming of sexual maturation, as well as later met-
abolic patterns. Intrauterine growth retardation and small size

 for gestational age have been identified as early-life risk fac-
tors for premature adrenarche (12, 13). In addition, in a large
cohort of adolescent girls, Maisonet et al. (14) recently found
that daughters of obese and overweight mothers reported ear-
lier stages of breast development and menarche than daughters
of women who had a normal pregravid weight. Other early-life
factors such as primiparity, smoking during pregnancy, and
rapid weight gain during infancy were also associated with ear-
lier timing of pubertal onset and menarche in that study (14),
corroborating results from other studies that have found an as-
sociation between rapid infant weight gain and earlier onset of
menarche (12, 15). These studies indicate the importance of
early-life factors influencing the timing of pubertal develop-
ment in girls.
The incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and
the prevalence of obesity among women of reproductive age
have increased during the last several decades (13, 16, 17).
The adrenal cortex has receptors for insulin and growth fac-
tors, and previous studies have suggested that increased lev-
els of insulin in girls may boost androgen production from the
adrenal glands, triggering adrenarche (18–21). Daughters of
women whose pregnancies were complicated by GDM or
obesity are at higher risk of insulin resistance and develop-
ment of diabetes in the future (22, 23). Since rapid infant
weight gain, which appears to be related to earlier pubertal
development (12, 14, 15), is a known risk factor for insulin
resistance (24, 25), pregnancy obesity and GDM may also in-
fluence the timing of puberty onset in the offspring through a
similar mechanism. Therefore, we conducted analyses exam-
ining the associations between pregravid obesity and GDM in
mothers and the timing of thelarche and pubarche in their
daughters, using data from a longitudinal study of a multieth-
nic cohort of girls drawn from the membership of a large in-
tegrated health-care delivery system in Northern California.
METHODS
This study was conducted as part of the National Institute
of Environmental Health Sciences/National Cancer Institute
Breast Cancer and the Environment Research Program, which
included 3 collaborative epidemiologic studies examining
environmental and other factors that influence pubertal mat-
uration(26).Thepresentanalysiswascarriedoutwithinoneof
these prospective cohort studies, the Cohort Study of Young
Girls’ Nutrition, Environment, and Transitions (CYGNET).
CYGNET investigates pubertal maturation in the diverse
membership of a health maintenance organization, Kaiser
Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Written informed
consent and assent were obtained from parent and child par-
ticipants, respectively, and the study protocol was approved
by the Kaiser Permanente Institutional Review Board.
Participants and procedure
The CYGNET investigators recruited 444 girls and their
caregivers (96% mothers) from KPNC members in the San
Francisco Bay Area, Northern California. The study protocol
hasbeendescribedindetailpreviously(27).Briefly,girlswere
enrolled in the study at age 6–7 years at recruitment (a hand-
ful were 8 years of age at the time of baseline examination)
and were ethnically diverse (see Table 1). Girls were members
of the KPNC health-care system at birth (1997–1999) and at
recruitment (2005–2006). At each annual study visit (mean du-
ration of follow-up in this analysis was 5.4 years; range, 1–7
years), anthropometric measurements were taken, and pubertal
staging for breast and pubic hair development was assessed
based on the methods of Biro et al. (1) and Marshall and Tanner
(28), using palpation for assessment of breast stage and visual
inspection for assessment of pubic hair. Other data, such as in-
formation on demographic and lifestyle factors, were collected
through annual interviews conducted with caregivers and with
the girls themselves when they were old enough to provide their
own information (ages 10–14 years).
Measurements
Exposure variables.
Maternal pregravid body mass index.
Maternal pregravid body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
weight (in kilograms) divided by squared height (in meters)
from self-reported prepregnancy weight and height data,
obtained from the CYGNET questionnaire completed at en-
rollment. We categorized women’s pregravid BMI as normal-
weight (BMI <25.0), overweight (BMI 25.0–<30.0), or obese
(BMI ≥30.0).
Maternal GDM.
Each girl’s medical record was linked to
her mother’s medical record. In the KPNC system, 96% of
pregnancies are screened for GDM using a 50-g, 1-hour oral
glucose challenge test (screening test), in accordance with
American Diabetes Association recommendations (29). If
the screening test result is abnormal, a diagnostic 100-g,
3-hour oral glucose tolerance test is performed. Pregnancy
glucose values were obtained from the KPNC GDM registry
(13). The validity of plasma glucose results obtained from
our laboratory is supported by previously published data
(30–33). GDM was defined according to the Carpenter and
Coustan thresholds (29) for the diagnostic test, as 2 or more
values meeting or exceeding the following plasma glucose
cutpoints: fasting glucose 95 mg/dL; 1-hour glucose 180
mg/dL; 2-hour glucose 155 mg/dL; and 3-hour glucose 140
mg/dL.
Outcomes (onset of thelarche and pubarche).
Pubertal
maturation staging was assessed by means of the gold-standard
method for epidemiologic studies: 5-stage Tanner staging
(28) conducted by trained personnel. Research staff were
trained and certified for these assessments by a pediatric en-
docrinologist (L.G.). For this study, onset of breast develop-
ment and pubic hair development were coded separately for
each study visit as “no onset” (stage 1) or “onset” (stage 2 or
above).
Covariates.
Girl’s BMI.
The study clinic visit included
several anthropometric measurements. Height was measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm using a mounted wall stadiometer, with
the participant in stocking feet and head in the neutral position.
Weight was measured without shoes and in light clothing and
was rounded to the nearest 0.5 kg. These measurements were
used to calculate BMI, and associated percentiles and z scores
were determined for the appropriate age- (and sex-) specific
Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention year 2000
standard population distribution. As covariates, we included
baseline BMI and BMI immediately prior to puberty onset

 separately; because the results were similar, we used baseline
BMI, since data on this variable were available for a larger
number of girls than BMI more proximal to puberty onset.
Other covariates.
Girls’ and mothers’ demographic infor-
mation and maternal age at menarche were obtained from the
CYGNET questionnaires. Girl’s race/ethnicity was assessed
using the primary caregiver’s report at baseline, and was coded
into mutually exclusive categories as African-American or
black, Hispanic or Latina, Asian, or non-Hispanic white. Girl’s
birth weight was obtained from the KPNC electronic data-
bases. Caregivers reported annual household income at base-
line. Income was dichotomized into “lower” (<$50,000/year)
and “higher” (≥$50,000/year) income. Maternal age at menar-
che was defined categorically as age in years (<12, 12–<13,
13–<14, or ≥14).
Statistical analyses
Analyses of maternal GDM and pregravid obesity in rela-
tion to pubarche and thelarche used Weibull regression,
which is both an accelerated failure time model and a propor-
tional hazards regression model, with accommodation of left,
right, and interval censoring (34). Interval censoring resulted
from assessing pubertal stage at study examinations only; the
exact time of transition for a girl who was at stage 1 at one
examination and at stage 2 at the following examination was
unknown.
The time interval in which pubarche or thelarche occurred
was defined as falling between the last examination with pu-
bertal assessment of stage 1 (with no previous assessment of
stage 2+) and the first examination at pubertal stage 2 or
greater. A study participant was considered left-censored if
she had already transitioned to stage 2 or higher at the time
of baseline examination and right-censored if she had not
transitioned by the time of the last examination. Regression
analyses provided 2 estimates of association (and 95% con-
fidence intervals) between a covariate and the outcome of
time to pubertal onset. The time ratio is interpreted as the
ratio of the median (or any other quantile) time-to-event for
a given level of a covariate to the referent level. The hazard
ratio is interpreted as the risk of transitioning to Tanner breast
development stage 2+ or pubic hair stage 2+ (PH2+) for a
given level of a covariate compared with the referent level.
The associations between maternal GDM and prepregnancy
obesity and pubertal onset were examined for breast and
pubic hair development in separate analyses, without adjust-
ment as well as with adjustment for known confounders, such
as girl’s race/ethnicity, mother’s age at menarche, and house-
hold income.
Effect modification between maternal GDM and obesity
was evaluated by including a cross-product term. The medi-
ating roles of girl’s BMI and birth weight were tested by com-
paring the coefficients between models with and without
these variables, also adjusting for other confounders men-
tioned above. If the observed association was attenuated sub-
stantially (>10% of the effect estimate) after the inclusion of a
potential mediator, this was taken to indicate that the variable
may mediate the association (35). All analyses used SAS stat-
istical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina).
RESULTS
Participant characteristics
Of the 444 participants enrolled at baseline, we excluded
27 mother-daughter pairs who were missing information on
GDM status and 58 pairs who were missing data on pregravid
BMI. The analyses comparing those pairs that were included
with those that were excluded did not demonstrate substantial
differences in the distributions of the exposure or outcome
variables (data not shown). Table 1 shows the baseline char-
acteristics of these study pairs, stratified by GDM status and
pregravid BMI category. Daughters of women whose preg-
nancies were complicated by GDM were more likely to
have a greater waist:height ratio, and their mothers were
likely to have lower educational attainment than those with-
out GDM. Daughters of women who had pregravid BMI ≥30
were more likely to be Hispanic or African-American, to have
greater BMI and waist:height ratio, and to have transitioned
to PH2+ by the time of the baseline examination. Mothers
with pregravid obesity were younger, less educated, and of
lower income than women without it.
Primary analyses
Associations between pregravid obesity and GDM and
onset of thelarche.
In crude analyses, daughters of women
who were obese prior to pregnancy were more likely to have
transitioned to breast development stage 2+ than those with
pregravid BMI <25 (Table 2). The corresponding time ratio
of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93, 0.99) translates
to an approximately 4-month difference in the estimated me-
dian age at onset of thelarche between these groups. However,
the associations were attenuated and not statistically significant
after adjustment for race/ethnicity, household income, and
maternal age at menarche. There was no association between
maternal GDM and timing of thelarche.
Associations between pregravid obesity and GDM and
onset of pubarche.
Without adjustment for covariates, girls
whose mothers were obese prior to pregnancy had a higher
risk of an earlier transition to PH2+ than those whose mothers
had pregravid BMI <25 (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.08, 95% CI:
1.53, 2.82). The corresponding time ratio of 0.92 (95% CI:
0.88, 0.95) translates to an approximately 11-month differ-
ence in the estimated median age at onset of pubarche be-
tween these groups. Daughters of overweight mothers also
had a younger age of transition to PH2+ (HR = 1.47, 95%
CI: 1.12, 1.93; time ratio = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99 (approx-
imately 7 months earlier)) than those whose mothers had pre-
gravid BMI <25, and there was a dose-effect relationship
between pregravid BMI and onset of pubarche (P < 0.0001).
However, associations were attenuated and no longer statisti-
cally significant after adjustment for race/ethnicity, house-
hold income, and maternal age at menarche. There was no
association between maternal GDM and onset of pubarche
(Table 3).
Interaction between pregravid BMI and maternal GDM.
Lastly, we evaluated possible interactions between maternal
pregravid obesity and GDM (Table 4). The test for interaction
suggested a possible interaction for pubarche (P = 0.08) but
not thelarche (P = 0.77). After adjustment for race/ethnicity,

 household income, and maternal age at menarche, there was a
significant increase in risk of an earlier transition to PH2+ for
girls whose mothers had both GDM and pregravid BMI ≥25
in comparison with the referent group (those with no GDM
and with pregravid BMI <25). Those girls on average transi-
tioned to PH2+ substantially earlier than the referent girls
(time ratio = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.83, 0.96). The hazard of having
transitioned to PH2+ was approximately 3-fold (HR = 2.97,
95% CI: 1.52, 5.83) in this group, compared with the referent
group. There was no effect of the association between mater-
nal pregravid obesity and GDM on thelarche in our data.
Supplemental analysis
To evaluate whether the effect of the interaction between
maternal obesity and GDM on the timing of girl’s pubarche
was mediated by girl’s obesity or birth weight, we conducted
analysesincludinggirl’sbaselineBMIorbirthweightasamedi-
ator. Inclusion of girl’s BMI (baseline or proximal to pubarche)
or birth weight had only a modest impact on the effect esti-
mates. Compared with the group whose mothers were without
GDM and had pregravid BMI <25, the hazard ratio for transi-
tion to PH2+ among daughters of those with pregravid obesity
and GDM was 2.53 (95% CI: 1.27, 5.05) when girl’s baseline
BMI was included in the model; this finding was somewhat at-
tenuated from that obtained in the model without either girl’s
BMI or birth weight (HR = 2.97, 95% CI: 1.52, 5.83). When
girl’s later BMI was included, the results were more similar
to those from the model without inclusion of BMI (HR = 2.79,
95% CI: 1.29, 6.01). Similarly, the hazard ratio for the same as-
sociation including birth weight (HR = 3.16, 95% CI: 1.59,
6.30) was not substantially different from that excluding girl’s
BMI and birth weight, suggesting that these variables did not
fully explain the observed association.

 DISCUSSION
In this multiethnic cohort of mother-daughter pairs, we ob-
served that daughters of mothers who had both pregravid
obesity and GDM were more likely to experience an earlier
transition to PH2+ than girls whose mothers had no GDM and
a BMI <25 prior to pregnancy. This association was indepen-
dent of race/ethnicity, household income, and maternal age at
menarche, and it was not explained by girl’s BMI or birth
weight. Mothers’ pregravid obesity or GDM did not appear
to influence their daughters’ age at onset of thelarche.
Animal and human studies have demonstrated that mater-
nal GDM and obesity lead to persistent changes in offspring
metabolism, such as in utero hyperinsulinemia, pancreatic
β-cell secretory capacity, abnormal insulin signaling in insulin-
sensitive tissues, and abnormal development of the hypothal-
amus and adrenal gland—all displaying associations with
aberrant control of energy regulation and obesity (14, 36–
43). Therefore, it is plausible that in utero exposure to GDM
and obesity through fetal hyperinsulinemia may alter time to
adrenarche. Although our study did not measure premature
adrenarche (often determined by a high level of dehydroepian-
drosterone sulfate and other adrenal androgens) as an outcome,
pubarche, or the appearance of pubic hair, is one of the phys-
ical signs of adrenarche. Our results extend previous findings
that early-life factors such as intrauterine exposure to maternal
obesity probably alter metabolic programming in female off-
spring, putting them at higher risk of future chronic conditions
related to metabolic dysregulation.
Although we hypothesized that in utero exposure to mater-
nal GDM and obesity would also be associated with the tim-
ing of thelarche via adiposity in the girls, we did not observe
the association after adjustment for other factors known to in-
fluence thelarche. It is possible that the underlying metabolic
pathways that influence age at onset of pubarche versus the-
larche are differentially affected by maternal obesity or GDM.
From a methodological perspective, classification of breast
development is more difficult to assess than pubic hair, in
part because of the influence of adiposity. This may have
led to nondifferential misclassification and therefore no asso-
ciation with breast development (35). The observed null find-
ing may also have been due to effect modification by race/
ethnicity. We adjusted the results for income and maternal
age at menarche to control for hereditary and socioeconomic
factors. The strongest attenuation was seen with inclusion of
race/ethnicity, suggesting the importance of race/ethnicity’s
role in both prevalences of pregravid obesity and GDM and
girl’s pubertal onset. Unfortunately, we did not have enough
statistical power to conduct analyses stratified by race/ethnicity,
an important variable that has been shown to interact with re-
lationships between prenatal factors and birth outcomes in
previous studies (44–46). We did conduct stratified analyses
comparing whites withnonwhites and comparing lower house-
hold income (<$50,000/year) with higher income (≥$50,000/
year). Although neither of these analyses showed differences
in the effect estimates between the groups (data not shown),
we cannot preclude the possibility of effect modification by
race/ethnicity in full-powered studies. Future studies that in-
clude diverse and large study populations should examine the
role of race/ethnicity to shed more light on the interplay among
these important variables.
While our findings represent important additions to the ex-
isting evidence regarding the risk factors for early pubarche,
they should be interpreted with caution. First, maternal pre-
gravid weight and height were self-reported. However, be-
cause of the unique availability of linkage of child medical
records with maternal records at KPNC, we were able to com-
pare, in a subgroup, self-reported height and weight data with
height and weight recorded during pregnancy (measured at
the time of α-fetoprotein testing) in the electronic medical
record. The results were similar (for PH2+ analysis compar-
ing pregravid BMI ≥30 with pregravid BMI <25, HR = 1.13
(95% CI: 0.70, 1.83) using self-reported BMI vs. HR = 1.32
(95% CI: 0.83, 2.11) using BMI from medical records), mak-
ing it unlikely that self-reporting per se biased the results.
Second, we did not have information on intrauterine growth
retardation, which is known to be associated with timing of
pubarche. We did examine the potential mediating roles of
birth weight and gestational age, as well as small size for ges-
tational age; however, inclusion of these variables did not
change the effect estimates substantially. Lastly, due to the
small sample size, we may not have been able to detect signif-
icant associations, especially in stratified analyses such as the
one shown in Table 4. It is unlikely that we observed a strong
Table 4.

 association between maternal pregravid obesity and GDM and
timing of pubic hair development only by chance. However,
these results should be interpreted with caution and be repli-
cated to confirm the associations. These limitations—possible
measurement error in pregravid BMI, lack of information on
intrauterine growth retardation, and a relatively small sample
size—do not influence the major strengths of this study. These
strengths include its prospective design, the use of objective
glucose measurements to define GDM, and the use of gold-
standard assessments of pubertal staging in an ethnically di-
verse sample. Few studies provide the opportunity to examine
these questions in such a data-rich setting.
In summary, in this ethnically diverse study of mother-
daughter pairs, maternal pregravid obesity, particularly in the
presence of GDM, was found to be a strong risk factor for early
onset of pubarche in girls, and the association was not fully
mediated by girl’s prepubertal obesity or birth weight. A sim-
ilar association was not seen for thelarche. The concept of
windows of susceptibility over the life course provides an im-
portant conceptual framework for understanding how prenatal
exposures may influence the health of offspring, which may
continue over generations. We found an association between
in utero exposure to maternal obesity and GDM and the female
offspring’s metabolic programming, manifested as early onset
of pubarche. Our finding suggests that there may be strategies
for slowing down the trend toward earlier sexual maturation in
girls by designing upstream interventions to manage obesity
and hyperglycemia among women who are pregnant or plan-
ning to become pregnant.
