Depression More Effective Than Placebo? 
A Systematic Review of Studies 
Since 2009

Background: A 2010 review of studies, previous reviews and meta-analyses found min-
imal evidence that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for depression was more effective 
than placebo during the treatment period and no evidence at all of efficacy beyond the 
end of treatment. The current review explored whether any contradictory evidence 
has since been generated. Method: MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched to iden-
tify all post-2009 studies that had compared ECT and simulated ECT for depression, 
or had in any other way generated valid depression data for ECT recipients at two or 
more points in time. Results: Ninety-one studies met inclusion criteria. There were 
no new placebo-controlled trials. There have now been no such studies since 1985. 
Only 4 placebo-controlled studies have ever produced data beyond the end of treat-
ment, none of which have found any advantage for ECT over placebo. Of the 91 stud-
ies, only 2 aimed to evaluate the efficacy of ECT. Both were severely flawed. None of 
the other 89 produced robust evidence that ECT is effective for depression, primarily 
because at least 60% maintained ECT participants on medication and 89% produced 
no meaningful follow-up data beyond the end of treatment. No studies investigated 
whether ECT prevents suicide. Conclusions: There is still no evidence that ECT is 
more effective than placebo for depression reduction or suicide prevention. Given the 
well-documented high risk of persistent memory dysfunction, the cost-benefit analysis 
for ECT remains so poor that its use cannot be scientifically, or ethically, justified.

T
he administration of electricity to the human brain to cause a seizure, in the hope of 
ameliorating depression and other problems, remains the most controversial of psy-
chiatric treatments. Although much of this controversy focuses on whether or not 
it causes brain dysfunction and increases risk of mortality (Breggin, 2008; Read & Bentall, 
 6 
Read and Arnold
2010; Read, Bentall, Johnstone, Fosse, & Bracken, 2013; Ross, 2006; Sackeim et al., 2007), 
there is also debate about what benefits there are which might outweigh the risks.
In 2010, the first author of this article, and the renowned British clinical psycholo-
gist Professor Richard Bentall, published a peer-reviewed systematic review of 70 years of 
research on the effectiveness of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on depression (its pri-
mary target today) and “schizophrenia.” The review found only 10 depression studies com-
paring ECT to the appropriate placebo (simulated electroconvulsive therapy [SECT]—in 
which the general anesthetic is applied but the electricity is withheld). Six of the 10 studies 
reported some short-term benefit during the course of treatment for a minority of the ECT 
recipients, sometimes perceived only by psychiatrists but not by other raters. The other 
4 studies reported no differences at all. None of the 10 studies reported any difference 
between ECT and SECT beyond the end of treatment. In fact, only 4 studies had followed 
participants beyond the end of treatment. None of these 4 found any difference between 
ECT and SECT (Read & Bentall, 2010).
As revealing as the findings themselves are, it is equally concerning that in 70 years 
since the introduction of ECT, there had only ever been four placebo-controlled studies 
examining whether ECT has any benefits for depressed people after the treatment has 
finished. The last of these was in 1985 (Gregory, Shawcross, & Gill, 1985; finding no dif-
ference between the ECT and SECT groups at either 1 month or 3 months after the last 
electroshock). So, despite the absence of any evidence up until 1985 that ECT has any 
lasting effect on depression, there had, in 2010, been no further attempts to produce any 
evidence for 25 years.
Similarly, the 2010 review identified no evidence that ECT has any benefit beyond 
the end of treatment for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. The two most recent stud-
ies comparing ECT and SECT for people diagnosed with schizophrenia had found no 
differences at all, either during or after treatment (Sarita, Janakiramiaiah, Gangadhar, 
Subbakrishna, & Rao, 1998; Ukpong, Makanjuola, & Morakinyo, 2002).
The 2010 review noted, moreover, that there had been eight meta-analyses on ECT 
for depression (Gábor & László, 2005; Greenhalgh, Knight, Hind, Beverley, & Walters, 
2005; Janicak et al., 1985; Kho, van Vreeswijk, Simpson, & Zwinderman, 2003; Pagnin, 
de Queiroz, Pini, & Cassano, 2004; Tharyan & Adams, 2005; UK ECT Review Group, 
2003; Van der Wurff, Stek, Hoogendijk, & Beekman, 2003), and three on ECT for schizo-
phrenia (Greenhalgh, et al., 2005; Painuly & Chakrabarti, 2006; Tharyan & Adams, 
2005). None of these meta-analyses had identified any studies showing that ECT had any 
benefit beyond the day of the final treatment. There has been one subsequent depression 
meta-analysis (Dierckx, Heijnen, van den Broek, & Birkenhäger, 2012). It cited no studies 
providing any data beyond the end of treatment (or even any studies comparing ECT to 
placebo during treatment).
The 2010 review also reported that there was no evidence, of any kind, in support of the 
hypothesis that ECT prevents suicide (Read & Bentall, 2010, pp. 339–340).
In the 4 years preceding 2010, two peer-reviewed reviews (Rasmussen, 2009; Ross, 
2006), and two books—based on scientific studies (Breggin, 2008) and personal evi-
dence (Andre, 2009)—had reached similar conclusions to the 2010 review; for example, 
“Rigorously defined endogenously depressed patients did exceptionally well with sham 
ECT, as well as with real ECT” (Rasmussen, 2009, p. 59).
The current review sought, first, to update the 2010 review, by determining if there 
was any new evidence that ECT recipients experience more reduction of their depression 
 Is Electroconvulsive Therapy More Effective Than Placebo? 
7
than recipients of SECT at any point in time after the final shock has been administered. 
Second, a systematic review was conducted to identify any new evidence (since 2010), of 
any kind, that ECT is an effective treatment for depression.
METHOD
An electronic search was conducted to identify all studies published since December 2009 
comparing ECT and SECT, or in any other way generating meaningful depression data 
for ECT recipients. MEDLINE and PsycINFO were searched using the following terms: 
(ECT OR electroconvulsive therapy OR electroshock therapy OR electroconvulsive treatment 
OR electroshock treatment) in combination with (depression OR depressive OR mood disor-
der) OR (placebo OR sham OR simulated). Inclusion criteria were original research studies 
that reported depression scores at two or more points in time, of adult (older than 18 
years old) ECT recipients, regardless of the research question; and use of any empirically 
validated measure of depression. Case reports, review articles, letters to the editor (with 
no empirical research), animal studies, and papers written in languages other than English 
were excluded. Data from study samples identified as overlapping were excluded.
The abstracts of all retrieved articles were assessed for relevance using the inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. The full text was accessed if relevance could not be determined from 
the abstract. The reference lists of relevant reviews were also manually screened to iden-
tify any additional studies. Because our search yielded only two studies explicitly aiming to 
investigate the efficacy of ECT, data were extracted from studies with other aims. Studies 
were included for data extraction if depression scores were available for all participants 
receiving ECT (without adjunct treatments).
Studies meeting the inclusion criteria are summarized in Table 1, listed according to 
study design, inclusion of a follow-up period, reporting of suicide rates or suicidality, 
whether concomitant use of drug therapy was allowed, and the diagnoses of the samples. 
Most of the data were extracted from studies not directly investigating the efficacy of ECT, 
so not all studies reported on the statistical significance of change in depression over time. 
As such, we also ranked the format of reported results in the following hierarchical man-
ner (from strongest to lowest level of evidentiary support): reporting statistical significance 
of change in depression; reporting pre–post ECT scores without indicating statistical sig-
nificance; graphical representation of change only; and reporting only the proportion of 
responders or remitters.
RESULTS
Focus and Design of the 91 Studies
Details of the search process are presented in Figure 1. Of the 2,513 studies yielded by the 
search process, 91 met the inclusion criteria. Table 1 outlines the methodological compo-
nents of the studies that produced data that directly (2) or indirectly (89) addressed the 
efficacy of ECT for depression. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were defined as stud-
ies with active control arms (including other treatments) and were not limited to studies

with a placebo/nonactive control component. All prospective cohort or noncomparative 
studies were defined as “Observational Studies” (prospective cohort studies follow a group 
of individuals over time to see whether factors on which people in the group differ affect 
certain outcomes).
Between 2010 and the end of 2016, there were zero placebo-controlled studies compar-
ing ECT and SECT for depression.
Since 2010, only two studies have explicitly attempted to investigate the efficacy of 
ECT. One attempted to examine the efficacy of ECT through comparison with another 
treatment. Schoeyen et al. (2015) conducted an RCT comparing the effectiveness of ECT 
to pharmacological treatment for individuals with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Magid, 
Truong, Trevino, and Husain (2013) conducted a retrospective review as a “preliminary

evaluation of the efficacy and efficiency” (p. 258) of ultrabrief right unilateral ECT, a 
newer form of ECT.
All other data in this review were extracted from 89 studies that did not aim to examine 
the efficacy of ECT but nevertheless included either pre–post ECT depression measures, or 
the proportion of responders/remitters after a course of ECT.
Of these 89 studies, 24 were RCTs (Abdallah, Fasula, Kelmendi, Sanacora, & 
Ostroff, 2012; Abdollahi et al., 2012; Bailine et al., 2010; Bjølseth et al., 2015; Brakemeier

5 were nonrandomized trials (Allen et al., 2015; Aten, Oudega, van Exel, Stek, & van 
Waarde, 2015; Gedge et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015; Okamoto et al., 2010).
Forty-seven of the 89 were observational studies (Azuma et al., 2011; Bär et al., 2010; 
Bayless et al., 2010; Beall et al., 2012; Bersani et al., 2014; Bilgen et al., 2014; Burgese &

& Thomson, 2011; Weeks et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2014).
Thirteen of the 89 were other retrospective reviews (Birkenhäger, Pluijms, Ju, Mulder, 
& van den Broek, 2010; Fernandez, Philpot, Marsh, Hartney, & Kozel, 2014; Gálvez et al., 
2013; Graveland, Wierdsma, van den Broek, & Birkenhäger, 2013; Järventausta et al.,

Pulia, Vaidya, Jayaram, Hayat, & Reti, 2013; Ueda, Koyama, & Okubo, 2010; Vaidya 
et al., 2012; Watts & Groft, 2010).
The aims of these 89 studies varied. About half (n � 45) investigated potential mecha-
nisms of action in ECT and/or predictors of response to ECT. Five compared ECT with 
other treatments; 12 examined the effects of differing parameters of ECT delivery; 12 com-
pared the effects of different anesthetic agents; 7 examined the effects of various adjuncts 
to ECT; 3 examined cognitive deficits after ECT and 3 naturalistic studies described the 
use of ECT over a period. In addition, there was one study examining the effects of ECT 
on Parkinson disease–induced psychosis, and one examining response to treatment after 
one session of ECT.
Most studies involved individuals with unipolar depression (52%) or included sam-
ples with mixed diagnoses (42%). Of the 91 studies meeting inclusion criteria, 50 (55%) 
 Is Electroconvulsive Therapy More Effective Than Placebo? 
11
reported on the statistical significance of the differences in depression scores over time. 
The remainder of the studies indicated some changes but did not report the statistical 
significance. Seventeen studies (19%) had some form of follow-up period (�1 week) after 
the end of the treatment period, 7 of which were RCTs.
Concomitant psychopharmacological medication was continued in 55 of the 91 studies 
(60%), with a further 14 (15%) not stating whether this was the case. So in only 22 (24%) 
were the ECT recipients definitely not receiving medication. Only one study reported on 
suicidality, but none reported on whether ECT prevented suicide.
Changes in Depression During the Treatment Period
There have been no placebo-controlled ECT studies on depression in the last 6 years, dur-
ing (or beyond) the treatment period.
There has been only one study that aimed to directly investigate the efficacy of ECT 
in depression through comparison with another treatment modality. It had no placebo 
control group and no data beyond the end of the treatment period. Schoeyen et al. (2015) 
performed a prospective randomized study with 73 individuals with treatment resistant 
bipolar disorder. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a 6-week course of ECT, 
or algorithm-based pharmacological treatment. The primary outcome measure was the 
longitudinal profile on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). 
Secondary outcome measures included longitudinal profiles on the Inventory of Depres-
sive Symptomatology-Clinician Rated, times to response and remission, and proportion 
of responders/remitters at the end of the 6-week treatment period. Response was defined 
as a decrease in MADRS score of at least 50% from baseline. Remission was defined as 
a MADRS score of 12 or lower. Linear mixed-effects modeling analysis indicated that 
the mean MADRS and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Clinician Rated scores 
were significantly lower in the ECT group than the pharmacology group at the end of 
the 6-week treatment period. However, because of differences in the handling of missing 
values, t test comparison indicated that the mean MADRS score (the primary outcome 
measure) did not differ between the pharmacological treatment group and the ECT group 
at the end of the 6-week treatment period. Among treatment completers (n � 43), the 
response rate was higher in the ECT group than in the pharmacological treatment group, 
but there was no difference in the remission rates.
Schoeyen et al. (2015) conclude that their “results show that ECT is more effective 
than pharmacological treatment in the acute phase of treatment-resistant bipolar depres-
sion, which supports ECT as a treatment option” (p. 49). However, several major limita-
tions need to be considered. First, to be included in this study, participants were required to 
be “treatment resistant”—defined as having no response to two or more trials with antide-
pressants and/or mood stabilizers with documented efficacy in bipolar disorder. A history of 
nonresponse to ECT was conversely an exclusion criterion. Thus, the study sample com-
prised only individuals for whom pharmacological treatment had already demonstrated 
inefficacy, and excluded all individuals for whom ECT had demonstrated inefficacy. Given 
that pharmacological treatment was already ineffective for these individuals, the superior-
ity of ECT over pharmacological treatment is neither unexpected nor generalizable. Sec-
ond, although blind raters co-rated some assessments, neither the patients nor the treating 
psychiatrists (who rated the outcome assessments) were blinded to treatment modality. 
Lack of blinding can bias both treatment outcomes and assessment thereof. Third, if 
 12 
Read and Arnold
individuals in the ECT group reached remission before the end of the 6-week treatment 
period, they were switched to an algorithm-based pharmacological maintenance treat-
ment (in accordance with the same treatment protocol as the pharmacological treatment 
group). However, the authors did not report on the number of participants in the ECT 
group that switched treatment groups and what maintenance treatment these individuals 
received. Thus, it is unclear how many individuals in the “ECT” group received ECT only, 
and how many received the same pharmacological treatment as the comparison group, or 
for how long. In other words, an early responder to ECT may have not relapsed because 
they were now on medication rather than because they had received ECT.
Beside Schoeyen et al. (2015), there was only one other study that directly aimed to 
investigate the efficacy of ECT. It has no data beyond the end of the treatment period 
and no control group, placebo or otherwise. Magid et al. (2013) retrospectively reviewed 
the preliminary efficacy and efficiency of ultrabrief right unilateral ECT after the adop-
tion of a new ECT protocol at the University of Texas Southwestern Department of ECT. 
Response to ECT was defined as greater than 5-point decrease on the Patient Health Ques-
tionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer, Kroenke, & Williams, 1999) and a final PHQ-9 score of less 
than 10. Remission was defined as a final PHQ-9 score of 5 or less. The review demonstrated 
that 68% of the 62 participants (including diagnoses of unipolar and bipolar depression) 
responded to ECT and 44% reached remission criteria. Although this study directly aimed 
to investigate efficacy, PHQ-9 scores before and after ECT were not reported. Furthermore, 
the study is limited by its retrospective design and, most important, again, by the lack of 
any sort of control group.
Of the other 89 studies included in this review, 46 reported on whether or not their find-
ings were statistically significant during the treatment period (3 additional studies reported 
on statistical significance but only at follow-up). Only 1 of these 46 did not find a statisti-
cally significant reduction in depression during the ECT treatment course. Ueda et al. 
(2010) examined whether ECT could alleviate psychosis related to Parkinson’s disease and 
antiparkinsonian medication. The mean of the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
(HDRS-17) decreased but did not reach statistical significance in this sample of five indi-
viduals. All other studies that reported level of significance found a statistically significant 
reduction on a depression measure during the course of ECT treatment. This included 31 
observational studies, 10 RCTs including an ECT-only group, 2 nonrandomized trials, and 
2 retrospective reviews. In none of these studies was ECT compared to a control group 
that did not receive ECT and, therefore, reductions in depression cannot be attributed to 
ECT. Reductions could, for instance, have been spontaneous remission and/or the result of 
placebo effects such as the hope and expectation created by any treatment and particularly 
by a major procedure such as ECT (Rasmussen, 2009; Read & Bentall, 2010).
Changes in Depression Beyond the Treatment Period
Even if there was strong evidence that ECT reduces depression in the period during which 
it is being administered, without evidence that reduction lasts beyond the end of the treat-
ment period it cannot be claimed that the treatment is effective for the condition in ques-
tion. It is well established that ECT recipients have very high relapse rates after the end of 
the treatment period (Kellner et al., 2006; Read & Bentall, 2010; Sackeim et al., 2001).
Only 17 of the 91 studies (19%) included a follow-up period (defined as �1 week after 
the final treatment). Four of these were uninformative about the long-term effects on ECT 
 Is Electroconvulsive Therapy More Effective Than Placebo? 
13
recipients in general, because data beyond the treatment period were selectively reported 
only for those individuals who responded, or remitted, during treatment (Brakemeier 
et al., 2014; Lucca et al., 2010; McCall et al., 2013; Yildiz et al., 2010). Two other studies 
did not report whether the level of difference at follow-up was statistically significant, and 
one study did not analyze the follow-up data because of small numbers (Loo et al., 2012; 
Loo et al., 2014; Rapinesi et al., 2013).
The remaining ten studies that included a follow-up period all reported reduced depres-
sion. Five of these studies reported a significant decrease in depression at the 1-month 
follow-up time point, in comparison to baseline severity (Hansen et al., 2011; Kayser 
et al., 2011; Minelli et al., 2014; Weeks et al., 2013; Yoosefi et al., 2014). Two observa-
tional studies (Johansson et al., 2010; Kalogerakou et al., 2015) both reported a significant 
decrease in depression compared to baseline, at 8–9 weeks follow-up and 6 months since 
the beginning of treatment, respectively. Three studies compared levels of depression at 
follow-up with depression at the end of the treatment period (Dukart et al., 2014; Meeter 
et al., 2011; Nordanskog et al., 2014). All three of these studies reported a significant 
improvement in depression during the treatment period. There were no further improve-
ments in any of these studies during the follow-up period, but the level of depression 
appeared to remain stable during the follow-up periods of 3 and 6 months.
Overall, although only 10 studies (11%) provided useable follow-up data, reduction 
in depression scores appeared to be maintained during the follow-up period. However, as 
with the studies demonstrating change during the treatment period, none of these studies 
included a placebo control group. Many were observational studies and/or had no group 
comparisons at all.
Suicide
Of the 91 included studies, none aimed to investigate whether ECT prevented suicide. Only 
one study examined suicidality in relation to ECT. Yildiz et al. (2010) conducted a pilot 
controlled study investigating early continuation pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to ECT. In 
addition to receiving ECT, participants were randomized to additionally receive early con-
tinuation pharmacotherapy, late continuation pharmacotherapy or placebo after the fourth 
session of ECT. The study considered the change in expressed suicidal thoughts, as recorded 
on Item 10 on the MADRS at baseline and after completion of ECT treatment course. 
However, data were only reported for all participants combined. As a result of this report-
ing, the change in suicidal thoughts in the placebo group, who only received ECT, was not 
determined.
DISCUSSION
In the decades since the introduction of ECT, most medical practitioners have come to 
subscribe to the principles of evidence-based medicine, which have been defined as “the 
conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about 
the care of individual patients” (Sackett, Rosenberg, Gray, Haynes, & Richardson, 1996). 
Subscribers to these principles tend to accept that although clinical decision-making 
can be informed by a range of types of knowledge, the most robust of these is data from 
placebo-controlled randomized trials (Cipriani, Girlanda, & Barbui, 2009). By 2010, there 
 14

had only been 10 such studies for ECT and depression, and none since 1985. Those 10 had 
produced minimal evidence of some temporary benefits, for a minority, during the treat-
ment period, and no evidence at all of benefits beyond the end of the treatment period.
In other medical disciplines, this state of affairs might have led either to a phasing out 
of the procedure or at least to a plethora of studies seeking to determine whether the treat-
ment in question does actually work. This is not the case for psychiatry and ECT. There 
has now not been a single placebo-controlled trial (randomized or otherwise) of whether 
ECT reduces depression for more than 30 years.
It is not the case, however, that there is no ECT research being conducted. Our review 
reported a multitude of studies, many seeking to establish whether one type of ECT is 
more effective, or produces less cognitive dysfunction, than another, but all simply assum-
ing that it does work. Only two studies in the last 6 years have made an explicit attempt 
to determine whether ECT works (Magid et al., 2013; Schoeyen et al., 2015). Both were 
so methodologically flawed as to be unable to answer the question in a scientifically mean-
ingful way. Of all the studies that inadvertently generated data that might have provided 
some support for the hypothesis that ECT is an effective treatment for depression 45% 
did not report statistical significance, 60% continued the ECT recipients on psychiatric 
drugs (with this being undetermined for a further 15%), 89% had no meaningful follow-up 
data beyond the end of treatment (and 81% no follow-up data at all), and 100% had no 
placebo control group. Despite the best, most inclusive, efforts of the reviewers, no new 
robust evidence has emerged in the past 6 years to support the hypothesis that ECT is any 
more effective in reducing depression than placebo. There has also been no new evidence 
to support the hypothesis that ECT prevents suicide.
Such continued failure to produce any evidence would be of less concern if there were 
not robust evidence that ECT causes long-lasting memory loss for a significant propor-
tion of recipients (Breggin, 2008; Read et al., 2013; Rose, Fleischmann, Wykes, Leese, & 
Bindmann, 2003; Ross, 2006; Sackeim et al., 2007).
Memory Loss
A 2003 review of studies of memory loss at least 6 months post-ECT found a range of 
51%–79% and a range for “persistent or permanent memory loss” of 29%–55% (Rose 
et al., 2003). In 2007, ECT proponent Professor Harold Sackeim and his colleagues con-
ducted the largest prospective study and found that autobiographical memory was sig-
nificantly worse than pre-ECT levels (p � .0001) both shortly after ECT and 6 months 
later (Sackeim et al., 2007). Furthermore, the degree of impairment was related to the 
number of administrations of ECT. Even using the very conservative cut off of 2 standard 
deviations worse than pre-ECT scores, 12% met the criterion for “marked and persis-
tent retrograde amnesia,” with higher rates for the two demographic groups who receive 
ECT disproportionately—women and older people. The impairment was also greater 
among those who received bilateral ECT rather than unilateral ECT. (Bilateral remains 
the most common form of ECT.) Significant memory loss is also consistently reported by 
many participants in qualitative studies of the subjective experience of ECT recipients 
(Fisher, 2012; Johnstone, 1999; Rose, Fleischmann, & Wykes, 2004; Rose et al., 2003). 
Although ECT proponents often seek to dismiss these findings as “subjective memory loss” 
(Read & Bentall, 2010, p. 343), that is, either imagined or caused by depression rather 
than ECT, a 2006 review concluded that “there is no evidence of a correlation between 
 Is Electroconvulsive Therapy More Effective Than Placebo?

impaired memory/cognition after ECT and impaired mood, much less a causal relation-
ship” (Robertson & Pryor, 2006, p. 230).
The most recent statement by the UK’s Royal College of Psychiatry (RCP) is
Memory problems can be a longer-term side effect. Surveys conducted by doctors and clinical 
staff usually find a low level of severe side-effects, maybe around 1 in 10. Patient-led surveys have 
found much more, maybe in half of those having ECT. . . . Some people do complain that their 
memory has been permanently affected, that their memories never come back. (Royal College of 
Psychiatrists, 2016)
A New Zealand Government report concurs, stating that “ECT may permanently affect 
memory and sometimes this can be of major personal significance” and bemoaning the 
“slowness in acceptance by some professional groups that such outcomes are real and sig-
nificant in people’s lives” (Ministry of Health, 2004, p. 16). A review of studies of the 
effects of ECT suggests that “ECT affects the brain in a similar manner as severe stress or 
brain trauma which activates the HPA axis and the dopamine system and may compro-
mise frontotemporal functions” (Fosse & Read, 2013, p. 1).
Conclusion
We conclude that the continued use of ECT is not consistent with an evidence-based 
approach to the practice of medicine. There is no new evidence in the last 6 years to chal-
lenge the conclusion, in the 2010 review, that “the cost-benefit analysis for ECT is so poor 
that its use cannot be scientifically justified” (Read & Bentall, 2010, p. 333).
The use of ECT has been steadily declining in many countries. In England for example, 
individual administrations have fallen from 159,600 in 1980 to 27,128 in 2006 (Singhal, 
2011), and to less than 15,000 in 2013 (Cresswell & Hodge, 2013). Nevertheless, it was 
estimated that at the turn of the century, about 1 million people worldwide were still 
receiving this procedure annually (Prudic, Olfson, & Sackeim, 2001). A more recent 
review of 70 studies, found “large variation between continent, countries and regions in 
utilization, rates and clinical practice” (Leiknes, Jarosh-von Schweder, & Høie, 2012, 
p. 296). High users include Australia, Belgium, Norway, Sweden, and the United States. 
In Australia (Oakley-Brown, 2015) and Texas (Swanson, 2014), the use of ECT has actu-
ally been increasing in recent years. An evidence-based approach to clinical care would, 
however, see a rapid decline in the use of this procedure. It seems reasonable to suggest, 
again, that
The continued use of ECT therefore represents a failure to introduce the ideals of evidence-
based medicine into psychiatry. This failure has occurred not only in the design and execution 
of research, but also in the translation of research findings into clinical practice. It seems there 
is resistance to the research data in the ECT community, and perhaps in psychiatry in general. 
(Read & Bentall, 2010, p. 344)
We should, meanwhile, remain cognizant of the fact that the archetypal ECT recipient 
remains, as it has for decades, a distressed woman more than 50 years old (Leiknes et al., 
2012; Read et al., 2013).
At the beginning of 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was taking 
submissions on their proposal to reclassify ECT devices from Class III (high risk) to Class II 
 16 
Read and Arnold
(low risk). On January 29, 2016, the president of the American Psychiatric Association, 
Dr. Renée Binder, urged members to support the proposal and drafted a letter for members 
to submit to the FDA, which included: “The APA considers ECT a safe and effective 
evidence-based medical treatment” (Binder, 2016). She did not recommend any research, 
old or recent, that they might submit in support of this claim. It seems there is none.
In July 2017, an updated search for new placebo-controlled studies comparing ECT and 
SECT for depression was conducted. There still were none.
Limitations
The primary limitation of this review is that there were insufficient properly designed 
studies (none) to permit any conclusions about whether ECT is effective for depression. 
The review could have been improved by searching more than two databases, having a 
second person check the selection of relevant articles, and attempting to retrieve unpub-
lished and ongoing studies. It should also be acknowledged that a review protocol was not 
preregistered.
