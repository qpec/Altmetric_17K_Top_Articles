Abstract
Background: Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is common in infants. When the condition causes pathological symptoms
and/or complications it is considered gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). It appears to be increasingly diagnosed
and causes great distress in the first year of infancy. In New South Wales (NSW), residential parenting services support
families with early parenting difficulties. These services report a large number of babies admitted with a label of GOR/
GORD. The aim of this study was to explore the maternal and infant characteristics, obstetric interventions, and reasons
for clinical reporting of GOR/GORD in NSW in the first 12 months following birth (2000–2011).
Methods: A three phase, mixed method sequential design was used. Phase 1 included a linked data population based
study (n = 869,188 admitted babies). Phase 2 included a random audit of 326 medical records from admissions to
residential parenting centres in NSW (2013). Phase 3 included eight focus groups undertaken with 45 nurses and doctors
working in residential parenting centres in NSW.
Results: There were a total of 1,156,020 admissions recorded of babies in the first year following birth, with 11,513
containing a diagnostic code for GOR/GORD (1% of infants admitted to hospitals in the first 12 months following birth).
Babies with GOR/GORD were also more likely to be admitted with other disorders such as feeding difficulties, sleep
problems, and excessive crying. The mothers of babies admitted with a diagnostic code of GOR/GORD were more likely to
be primiparous, Australian born, give birth in a private hospital and have: a psychiatric condition; a preterm or early term
infant (37-or-38 weeks); a caesarean section; an admission of the baby to SCN/NICU; and a male infant. Thirty six percent of
infants admitted to residential parenting centres in NSW had been given a diagnosis of GOR/GORD. Focus group data
revealed two themes: “It is over diagnosed” and “A medical label is a quick fix, but what else could be going on?”
Conclusions: Mothers with a mental health disorder are nearly five times as likely to have a baby admitted with GOR/GORD
in the first year after birth. We propose a new way of approaching the GOR/GORD issue that considers the impact of early
birth (immaturity), disturbance of the microbiome (caesarean section) and mental health (maternal anxiety in particular).

 Background
Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is common in preterm
and term infants [1] and is usually a self-limiting condition
[2]. GOR is generally described as the effortless reflux of
gastric contents into the oesophagus and is considered
physiologic when the infant thrives and experiences no se-
vere complications [3]. Symptoms may include sleep inter-
ruptions [4] frequent spitting up, posseting or vomiting,
fussiness during or following feeds and constant or sudden
crying, irritability and back arching, and is distressing for
infants and stressful for parents especially when regurgita-
tion is frequent [5, 6]. Parents will therefore seek support
and education on interventions to help alleviate these
symptoms [7].
When the condition causes pathological symptoms and/
or complications it is considered to be gastro-oesophageal
reflux disease (GORD) [6]. GORD is one of the most com-
monly misunderstood, and difficult to treat problems that
infants experience, and is characterised by chronic symp-
toms of mucosal damage caused by stomach acid rising
from the stomach into the oesophagus [6]. GORD is asso-
ciated with a range of adverse respiratory, gastrointestinal,
and neurobehavioral effects. Adverse effects may include
pain (oesophageal and/or ear), wheezing, apnoea, stridor,
recurrent bronchiolitis, episodes of oxygen desaturation,
aspiration pneumonia, swallowing dysfunction, frequent
vomiting, choking and gagging, lower energy intake and
excessive weight loss, disorganised and dysfunctional
sucking or swallowing, delayed readiness for solid foods or
food refusal and delayed development [8, 9]. GORD can
cause recurrent sleep interruptions [4, 8, 10, 11] and par-
ental descriptions of the symptoms experienced by their
infants, such as an inability to feed and settle can cause
considerable parental distress [12, 13]. There may also be
differential diagnosis such as hiatus hernia, urinary tract
infections, malrotation, pyloric stenosis and cow’s milk
intolerance [14].
Transient
lower
oesophageal
sphincter
relaxation
(TLOSR) resulting in an abrupt drop in oesophageal pres-
sure below gastric pressure, unrelated to swallowing, is
regarded as the dominant mechanism and main contribu-
tor to the pathophysiology of GORD in both term and
preterm infants [1]. The traditional view is that infants
with GORD also have delayed gastric emptying, though
the role of delayed gastric emptying in promoting GORD
is unclear. Gastric emptying time is inversely correlated
with gestational age at birth. Preterm babies for example
have slower gastric emptying. Gastric emptying has been
reported as occuring faster with breastmilk than with for-
mula [15]. It has also been proposed that increased intra-
abdominal pressure, and the fact that infants ingest a
much higher volume per kilogram of body weight than
older children and adults may increase the incidence of
reflux during a TLOSR. A baby consuming 180 mL/kg per
day corresponds to a daily intake of around 14 L/day in an
adult [16]. In addition, term and preterm infants with
feeding tubes may experience reflux episodes due to
mechanical interference of the lower oesophageal sphinc-
ter. It has also been suggested that stiff feeding tubes and
wide bore tubes hold open the gastro-oesophageal junc-
tion [17].
Determination of the exact prevalence of GOR versus
GORD is challenging because there is unclear demarca-
tion between physiologic and pathologic reflux and inci-
dence and prevalence data [18]. In infants 4 to 6 months
of age, the prevalence of GOR has been estimated as af-
fecting 23% to 29% of infants in Italy [19] USA [20] and
Japan [21] and 41% in Australia [22]. Preterm and low
birth weight infants are said to be at particularly high
risk of developing GORD [23]) with the overall inci-
dence estimated between 30 and 50% linked to the im-
maturity of the oesophagus and stomach [16]. This
variation in rates shows the difficulty in defining and
diagnosing GOR/GORD.
A range of diagnostic investigations may be under-
taken in the infant with problematic GORD. The most
sensitive objective measure of GORD is the pH probe
which provides a quantitative measure of frequency and
duration of oesophageal acid exposure [24]. Other
methods for detecting GORD include the use of multiple
intraluminal impedance and upper gastrointestinal en-
doscopy and oesophageal biopsy to directly look for in-
flammation or erosion [25]. Contrast studies can also be
used. Most of these investigations for detecting GORD
are invasive and should only be directed at infants pre-
senting with recurrent aspiration pneumonia, unex-
plained apnoeas, non-epileptic seizure-like events and
upper airway inflammation [26]. Good quality evidence
on pharmacological and non-pharmacological manage-
ment strategies for GOR and GORD in the infant popu-
lation is lacking and this creates challenges for clinicians
caring for this population [27].
The aim of this study was to explore the maternal and
infant characteristics, obstetric interventions, and rea-
sons for clinical reporting of GOR/GORD in NSW in
the first 12 months following birth (2000–2011).
Methods
This study is part of a larger study funded by the Austra-
lian Research Council to examine the physical, psycho-
logical and demographic characteristics, trends, service
needs and co-admissions to other health services of
women admitted to residential parenting services (RPS)
of Tresillian and Karitane in NSW from 2000 to 2011.
There is a tiered system of health services in Australia
providing maternal and child health support, including,
non-psychiatric day stay and residential parenting ser-
vices (RPS) such as Tresillian and Karitane (in NSW).

 RPS provide a range of services and interventions en-
hance infant caretaking skills and assist adjustment to
the work of motherhood [28, 29].
Research design
A three phase, mixed method sequential design (QUAN-
TITATIVE → Quantitative → Qualitative) design was
considered appropriate for this study as it uses a variety
of methods to explore complex phenomenon [30]. The
philosophical approach chosen for this mixed methods
study was pragmatism, which is an approach commonly
used in mixed methods research as it challenges the no-
tion of a single, absolute truth being attainable [31].
Pragmatism draws on what works using diverse ap-
proaches and valuing both objective and subjective
knowledge [32, 33] and is therefore problem centred ra-
ther than theory centred with the research question be-
ing more important than the method used.
The study was conducted across three sequential
phases, each phase informing the next. The sequential
design for this study takes a macro (linked data – popu-
lation wide - quantitative), meso (client notes - RPS -
quantitative) and micro (client notes and focus groups
with staff - RPS – qualitative) approach. Ethical approval
was obtained from the NSW Population and Health Ser-
vices Research Ethics Committee, Protocol No.2010/12/
291. This paper reports the component of the study fo-
cused specifically on GOR/GORD. Site specific approval
was gained from the two relevant Health Services.
Phase one
The New South Wales Centre for Health Record Link-
age conducted linkage of several datasets via the Health
Record Linkage (CHeReL). Hospital admission data –
Admitted Patient Data Collection (APDC) was examined
for the time period July 1st 2000 till December 31st
2011. The APDC provides demographic and treatment
information for all hospital and day stay units within
New South Wales (NSW). This dataset was linked to the
pregnancy and birth data (mother and baby) NSW, as
recorded in the NSW Perinatal Data Collection (PDC).
This population based surveillance system contains ma-
ternal and infant data on all births of greater than 400 g
birth weight and/or 20 completed weeks gestation. The
NSW PDC contains data on all births in NSW, around
one third of births which occur in Australia annually.
Probabilistic data linkage techniques were used for data
linkage and de-identified datasets were provided for ana-
lysis. Probabilistic record linkage software assigns a ‘link-
age weight’ to pairs of records. Records that match
perfectly or nearly perfectly on first name, surname, date
of birth and address have a high linkage weight, and re-
cords matching only on date of birth have a low linkage
weight. If the linkage weight is high then it is considered
it is likely that the records truly match. If the linkage
weight is low it is considered likely that the records are
not truly a match. This technique has been shown to
have a false positive rate of 0.3% of records [34].
Subjects
Infants admitted up to one year of age, recorded in the
APDC, who were coded with the International Classifica-
tion of Diseases (ICD-10-AM) codes K21.0 and K21.9,
comprised the cohort of infants with GOR/GORD. Any
baby with a congenital abnormality was removed from the
cohort in order to eliminate other potential structural de-
fects as a cause of GOR/GORD. The comparison cohort
consisted of infants with no ICD-10-AM codes K21.0 and
K21.9 documented. Admission events, length of stay and
co-morbidities were obtained from the APDC for both the
baby and the mother. Co-morbidities for the mother were
obtained from diagnostic codes applied to admissions
prior to, during and after the birth of the infant who re-
ceived a GOR/GORD diagnostic code. Data were provided
from the PDC and analysed to establish maternal parity,
pregnancy events, birth details and neonatal details.
Data analysis
Demographic data is reported between the comparison
groups according to GOR/GORD diagnosis utilising Chi
square for dichotomous variables and mean or median
comparison for continuous data. Logistic regression with
and without adjustment for maternal and neonatal fac-
tors was undertaken. Taking into account the size of the
cohort and the number of analyses undertaken, results
were considered significant at the level p < 0.01. Analysis
was undertaken with IBM SPSS v.22®.
Phase two
The residential parenting services of Tresillian and Kari-
tane in NSW admit around 3400 women a year (3.5% of
the population giving birth). Tresillian admits around
2633 women per year in three sites for residential care
and Karitane provides residential services for approxi-
mately 800 women per year. In order to obtain a more
contemporary and detailed understanding of the com-
plex pregnancy and birth factors, particularly psycho-
logical,
that
impact
on
GORD,
in
phase
two
we
randomly selected 326 medical records of women admit-
ted to RPS of Tresillian and Karitane in NSW in 2013
across the 12-month period (January 2013 to December
2013); 220 from Tresillian and 106 records from Kari-
tane. Only clinical records from women and infants
(women and infants while a dyad in terms of admission
have separate files) admitted in the year following birth
were examined.
Dahlen et al. BMC Pediatrics  (2018) 18:30 
Page 3 of 15
 Medical record data collection
Coded data collected from client records was entered
directly into SPSS with all available variables collected in-
cluding: demographics of the woman and her infant, type
of birth, pregnancy and birth complications, admission to
SCN/NICU, postpartum physical health problems and
mental health problems and social circumstances and rea-
son for admission. We also collected information about
services used /care pathways prior to admission. In this
paper we are just reporting the incidence of GOR/GORD
reported.
Data analysis
The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive
statistics and a comparison made between the findings
in the linked data and clinical notes for data items that
are common to both. The findings from stage one and
two were used to inform the focus group questions in
stage three. As the high incidence of GOR/GORD
emerged from the clinical records review we incorpo-
rated this into questions asked during the focus groups.
Phase three
In phase three, focus groups were used to explore from the
perspective of Karitane and Tresillian staff the characteris-
tics of women admitted to RPS, reasons for admission,
common prior events and health care pathways, barriers to
effective primary and secondary services and any perceived
changes in these over the past decade. All staff at Karitane
and Tresillian who worked in the RPS were informed about
the focus groups at staff meetings and via newsletters and
flyers placed in prominent locations.
Data collection
In total 45 staff (25 child and family health nurses
(CFHN), 10 enrolled nurses/mothercraft nurses, two psy-
chiatrists, six paediatricians and two general practitioners)
participated in eight focus groups. The focus groups took
approximately one hour and were guided by interview
questions/prompts which emerged following analysis of
data from previous phases. The issue of GOR/GORD was
explored with staff due to the finding in phases one and
two of high numbers of babies admitted to RPS who had a
GOR/GORD label. All participants agreed to the digital
recording of their interviews. Interviews were transcribed
verbatim using the transcribing service Pacific Solutions.
On receiving the transcripts all identifying information
was removed. The full methods around the focus groups
are described in another paper [35].
Data analysis
Thematic analysis was used to analyse the data. This was
undertaken by a research assistant and the first author.
Thematic analysis is an iterative process where concepts,
categories or themes and relationships with other categor-
ies or themes are refined through a series of steps: 1)
Multiple readings of the data and listening to the digital
recordings to become immersed in the data; 2) Identifica-
tion and labelling of concepts and development of prelim-
inary themes or categories from these concepts. These
themes are captured in phrases, and where appropriate,
use the language of the participants; 3) Further coding of
the data, identification of linkages and relationships
between themes.
Integration of the data
Integration of the data describes how the quantitative and
qualitative data is mixed during the research process [36].
The data were integrated and analysed at several points
throughout this sequential mixed methods study: Data
from phase one was used to develop the template for data
extraction from the clinical notes in phase two and the data
extracted from the clinical notes and linked data (quantita-
tive and qualitative) were used to inform the questions
asked during the focus groups with staff in phase three.
Once the study was completed further integration occur of
the data gathered in all three phases were used to identify
common findings and themes and these were used to
inform the explanatory conceptual model (Fig. 4).
Results
Phase one: Linked data
During the time period there were a total of 1,156,020
admissions recorded in the APDC of infants up to one
year of age. Some of these admissions involved multiple
admissions for the same infant. Of these admissions,
11,513 (1%) of all admissions contained a diagnostic
code for GOR/GORD. This equates to 869,188 individ-
ual infants being admitted and of these individual in-
fants, 9152 (1.1%) were admitted with GOR/GORD. The
percentage of admissions which included a diagnostic
code for GOR/GORD was 1.0%. This figure peaked at
1.1% with a nadir of 0.9%. The number of admissions
per infant ranged from 1 to 128. The maternal demo-
graphic and birth details are obtained in Table 1.
Women who had a baby with GOR/GORD were more
likely to be primiparous, born in Australia, give birth in
a private hospital, have hypertension, have a maternal
psychiatric condition noted on admission and have
undergone a caesarean section. Their babies were more
likely to be preterm or early term (37 & 38 weeks), have
a birth weight < 3rd centile, be resuscitated at birth or
admitted to a SCN/NICU and be male (Table 1.).
The highest incidence of GOR/GORD was seen in in-
fants born preterm. GOR/GORD continued to decline for
infants born at early gestational ages, levelling out from
40 weeks onwards (Fig. 1.). The first three to four months
following the birth was the peak time for admission with

 GOR/GORD (Fig. 2.), with a notable peak at around six
weeks postpartum when the postpartum check is done. In
residential units however the numbers of babies with
GOR/GORD remained significantly higher and were fairly
sustained over the 12 months following birth (Fig. 3.)
Other co-morbidities noted on admission associated
with an admission with GOR/GORD were excessive cry-
ing, feeding difficulties and sleep disorders which all cor-
relate with reasons for admission to RPS (Table 2).
Table 3 shows logistic regression results. The following
were significantly associated with a diagnostic code of GOR/
GORD: 1) Mother being primiparous, born in Australia, giv-
ing birth in a private hospital and having a maternal psychi-
atric condition. 2) Baby being a multiple, born preterm or
early term (37 or 38 weeks), born by caesarean section, hav-
ing a low Apgar, being resuscitated, being intubated, having a
NICU or SCN admission and being a male infant.
The most significant finding was that women with a
maternal psychiatric diagnosis were nearly five times as
likely to have a baby with GOR/GORD. When the main
categories of psychiatric diagnosis were further exam-
ined maternal anxiety appeared to have the strongest as-
sociation with having a baby admitted in the first year
following birth with GOR/GORD (Table 4).
Phase two: Medical records
In the review of 326 medical records we found 36% of
infants were reported to have GOR/GORD on admission
to the RPS. The rate was 32% in the Tresillian RPS (n =
220) and 43% in the Karitane RPS (n = 106).
Phase three: Focus groups
Eight focus groups were undertaken. In total 45 staff
took part. There were 25 CFHN, 10 enrolled nurses/
mothercraft nurses and 10 doctors (2 psychiatrists, 6
paediatricians and 2 GPs). The average number of years
in practice was 17.4 with a mean of 10.7 years working
in the RPS. Questions asked in the focus groups in-
cluded but were not limited to: ‘From your perspective,
what are the main reasons for admission to RPS for a
mother with an infant under 12 months of age? Have
you seen these reasons for admission change in the past
decade? Can you describe some of the characteristics of
the mothers, their partners and infants that you admit to
RPS? ‘In the focus groups GOR/GORD was raised by the
participants in six of the groups and mentioned in total
22 times. The paediatricians in particular had the most
to say on the subject. The following themes were found:
“It is over diagnosed” and “A medical label is a quick fix,
but what else could be going on?”
The following quote from a paediatrician summed up
the complexity of the situation when it came to GOR/
GORD diagnosis and treatment:
“I probably would say that a lot of babies do have re-
flux. I would say probably every baby has a form of re-
flux
until
they're
a
bit
older.
But
it's
then
the
interpretation from the parent that they see their baby in
pain. My baby's in pain and we've got to do something
about it. They go to their GP and they say my baby's very
unsettled, my baby's crying a lot. There could be another
reason, that she's always in the baby's face, or not allow-
ing the baby down, or not giving it time to settle, or it's
overtired as opposed - and the GP just goes, okay, here's
the script. He writes you up.” (Paediatrician).
It is over-diagnosed
There was a strong feeling from the participants that
GOR/GORD was over-diagnosed and that this came from
both the medical profession and from parents themselves:
“I think it gets misdiagnosed a lot too. I don't think every
baby that walks through has got GORD” (paediatrician).
Staff who had been working in the RPS for a while
noted that the label of GOR/GORD was being increas-
ingly used.

 “It was very unusual, I guess, 11 years ago, with the re-
flux medication. Now it just seems every Monday when
we do admissions, there's at least two or three, or more,
on reflux meds.” (Paediatrician).
The staff described how women did not want their ba-
bies to cry and felt there must be a medical reason if they
did. There was also a strong consensus amongst the paedi-
atricians that “they [doctors] are very quick to medicate”.
“They don't want babies to cry ever, so the baby cries,
there must be a reason; it must be reflux.”
“You have mums that say they go the doctor and say, I
want Losec (proton pump inhibitor) and the doctor will
write a script.”
The participants felt that this desire to have a diagnosis,
and specialists who tended to over diagnose, was creating
a trend where unsettled infants seemed to always be put
on anti-reflux medication:
“I think it's the most over-diagnosed - really the most
over-diagnosed disease that we see in infants because
everything seems to be down to - it used to be teeth, it used
to be child's awake at night because they're teething, now
it's everything's that. People like it because they can give
medication, the fact that medication does absolutely noth-
ing. They want something to be given, they want to med-
icalise it. It's sad - it goes right across the industry. It goes -
and it's been backed by certain specialists as well, a group
of gastroenterologists over there that love it, and it's a real
problem. So in fact we see certainly a large majority of the
kids that are coming here with unsettled behaviour will
come in on anti-reflux [medication]”(Paediatrician).
“I've been keeping a tally of how many babies come in
on medication for reflux. There's an average of about four
out of eight every single week that are either on Zantac,
Nexium or Losec, that present. So it's actually really high
- a high amount of mums - or a high amount of babies,
but I'm just wondering whether that goes back to what
you're saying, is that they go to the doctor or paediatri-
cian wanting an answer”(Paediatrician).

 Participants in the focus groups also felt that parents
wanted a diagnosis, “to have a label for their child so
that they can feel it's not all my fault.” The proliferation
of organisations and easy access to information through
social media was also leading parents to diagnose their
own babies.
“There are reflux associations and groups and band-
wagons so people think that sounds exactly like mine,
because of course these symptoms are so generic and
broad that it really could be anything. But yes my
baby cries, yes my baby arches, yes my baby doesn't
sleep, yes my baby vomits. If it doesn't vomit it's
sounds like reflux anyway. So you can't really - which-
ever way you look - so I think it's coming from so
many areas.”(Paediatrician).
“A lot of the time that's what the parents see. So they
don't see the other problem. They see the baby crying and
the baby vomiting. They look on the internet or talk to
parents, other parents, or their friends. Oh, your baby's
got reflux. [These are of course] problems but it may not
be.”(Nurse).
A medical label is a quick fix but what else could be
going on?
Participants in the focus groups felt that the medical label
of GOR/GORD was often a quick fix that stopped other
questions being asked about what else might be going on.
“Much easier for a parent to feel my baby has a med-
ical cause than maybe I'm not coping. Much easier for a
doctor to say it's reflux, I can do something about that
but I don't have time to spend an hour asking why your
relationship with your mother is so poor that you're not
coping and you've got a past history of attachment dis-
order. So I think it comes both from doctor, I think it
comes from expectation of parent, there's media, there's
hype, there's a lot of stuff out there about crying babies.
You type in crying baby, you see reflux.”(Paediatrician).
Paediatricians who participated in the focus groups ex-
plained the way they tried to reorientate thinking about
GOR/GORD in parents who were admitted to the RPS.
“These are the features I think typically are reflux and
these are not - in your baby I'm not seeing this and this
and this. I'm not saying there isn't some - you've got to be

 very diplomatic about who they've seen - but in my ex-
perience it's never just reflux. There's always a lot of sec-
ondary behaviour.”(Paediatrician).
There was a feeling that often the real cause of the
crying, unsettled baby was not being picked up because
of the assumption made that the diagnosis was GORD.
“Even if the diagnosis is correct, there may be other
things operating, making the matters worse. Or some-
times if the diagnosis is wrong - we've had babies here
that came in as a feeding problem. That's the other com-
mon thing, like breastfeeding problems for example. He's
not putting on weight, so the mum's not established
breastfeeding well.” (Nurse).
The nursing staff recognised this was an issue but did
not have the authority the paediatricians had to re-
orientate thinking around GOR/GORD.
“We've got a paediatrician that tries to normalise it, and
so does cease a lot of the medication if she can” (Nurse).
Integrated explanatory conceptual model
Based on the research undertaken in this mixed methods
study we propose a new way of approaching the GOR/
GORD issue that considers the impact of early birth (the
immature infant), disturbance of the microbiome (caesar-
ean section) and maternal mental health (anxiety) (Fig. 4).
Discussion
This mixed methods study aimed to explore the maternal
and infant characteristics, obstetric interventions, and
reasons for clinical reporting of GOR/GORD in NSW in
the first 12 months following birth (2000–2011). The diag-
nostic code was used for 1% of all infants admitted to hos-
pital in the year following birth. In the RPS however 36% of
infants admitted were reported to have GOR/GORD. Ba-
bies with GOR/GORD were more likely to be admitted
with other disorders such as feeding difficulties, sleep prob-
lems and excessive crying, as has been reported in the lit-
erature [8–11, 13].
The mothers of babies admitted with a diagnostic code
of GOR/GORD were more likely to have a psychiatric
condition (especially anxiety), have a preterm or early
term infant (37 or 38 weeks), have a caesarean section
and have an admission of the baby to SCN/NICU.
The fact that mothers with a mental health disorder
are nearly five times as likely to have a baby admitted
with GOR/GORD in the first year after birth calls for a
re-think about this issue. We propose a new way of ap-
proaching the GOR/GORD issue that considers the im-
pact of early birth (the immature infant), disturbance of
the microbiome (caesarean section) and maternal mental
health (anxiety) (Fig. 4).
The immature infant
In this study we found a strong association between pre-
term and early term birth and GOR/GORD. It was not
until after 40 weeks that the incidence of GOR/GORD
levelled out.

 The lower oesophageal sphincter (LES) is made up of in-
trinsic oesophageal smooth muscle and diaphragmatic skel-
etal muscle and acts defensively to prevent reflux [37].
Where once preterm infants were thought to have poor
LES tone, several studies using manometry documented
good LES tone in the preterm and low birthweight popula-
tions, which disputes the correlation of prematurity with
lower LES tone [37, 38]. Gupta and Jadcherla [39], while
evaluating the relationship between segmental oesophageal
lengths, growth parameters, gestational age and postmentr-
ual age in preterm and full-term infants, found an increase
in the length of the LES increased the length of distal high
pressure zone. The authors propose this as a possible
mechanism by which GOR/GORD improves with matur-
ation. More recently, however, maturation of LES has been
found to be less important in episodes of transient LES re-
laxations (TLESR) in relation to occurrence of GOR/
GORD. TLESRs are abrupt drops in oesophageal pressure
below that of gastric pressure, unrelated to swallowing that
allow GOR/GORD to occur [40, 41].
Iatrogenic immaturity
Intervention during childbirth has escalated dramatically
in much of the developed world in the past 20 years
[42]. In Australia, late preterm [43](Australian Institute
of Health & Welfare, 2015; [44] and early term births
[43] have steadily increased over the past decade. Com-
plications of late preterm (34–36 weeks) and early term
birth (37–38 weeks) are increasingly being recognised as
significant and include increased risk of jaundice [45]
and feeding difficulties [46]. In another study using na-
tional Australian population data [47] the authors found
that among low-risk women who had an unassisted vagi-
nal birth with spontaneous onset of labour and no
labour augmentation, the odds of admission to neonatal
intensive care or special care nursery were significantly
increased when the baby was 37 weeks’ gestation at the
time of birth [48] and this remained significant for low
risk primiparas who had a baby at 38 weeks gestation.
Some claim that during the final weeks of gestation
the fetal brain goes through a marked increase in mass
and nerve growth (corticoneurogenesis) which may be
best left undisturbed [49]. We have shown that low risk
women giving birth in private hospitals in NSW are
much more likely to give birth at earlier gestations than
their public hospital counterparts for every week up to
and including 40 weeks [42]. The finding in this study
that early term birth and birth in a private hospital is as-
sociated with an increase in GOR/GORD may be due to
several interacting factors. Very few women who book
care with a private obstetrician in a private hospital have
psychosocial screening done that might detect and en-
able mental health issues to be addressed. Secondly, the
numbers of early term deliveries due to increased
intervention is much higher than in the public sector.
The fact that this group of women are generally more
educated and access health services more readily may
also lead to an increased chance of diagnosis or over-
diagnosis. As was identified in the focus groups paedia-
tricians and general practitioners may more readily label
a crying baby as having GOR then delving into other
possible underlying factors that would require longer ap-
pointment time frames.
Disturbance of the microbiome
The fact that GOR/GORD was associated with caesarean
birth and resuscitation/admission to SCN/NICU pro-
vides another interesting possible answer to this com-
plex issue. Research on impact of mode of birth and
antibiotic use on the infant microbiome is gaining im-
portance. While we could not identify antibiotic usage in
this study, Australian research has shown that nearly
half of all babies that go to neonatal units will have anti-
biotics administered [50].
Evidence on the potential risks associated with the use of
antibiotics (both given to the mother during pregnancy/
labour and birth and to the baby after birth), includes in-
creased rates of asthma in early childhood [51, 52], infant
allergies to cow’s milk [53]; and higher rates of obesity [54].
There is mounting evidence that babies born by caesar-
ean delivery have different gut microbiota in the first
months of life to those born vaginally. This suggests the
route of birth may be fundamental to the founding physi-
ology of the gut flora. The CHILD study from Canada
used DNA sequencing to detect microbes in faecal sam-
ples from infants at age four months and found those born
by caesarean delivery had low bacterial richness and diver-
sity compared to those born vaginally [55].
Following caesarean delivery there are higher numbers of
cells secreting immunoglobulins (ImmunoglobulinA and
ImmunoglobulinG) at one year of age, and some studies
have found increased rates of asthma, gastroenteritis, rhin-
itis, food allergies, and type 1 diabetes in babies born via
caesarean section [56–58]. Antibiotic use has also been
shown to alter microbiota especially when used with caesar-
ean section and changes have been seen in children up to
12 months of age, especially where babies are not breastfed
[59]. We did not have reliable enough data to look at
method of infant feeding which is a limitation of our study.
Recent studies indicate a crucial role of the intestinal
microbiota in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal disor-
ders [60]. Probiotics have been found to significantly in-
crease intestinal blood flow [61], gastric emptying rate and
improve feeding tolerance [62] and growth [63]. Probiotics
may play a crucial role in the modulation of intestinal in-
flammation and they have been found to be effective in
several randomised controlled trials in reducing regurgita-
tion episodes in preterm and term infants [62, 64–66].

 Maternal mental health
The fact that having a maternal admission with a mental
health disorder increases the risk of a diagnosis in the
infant by more than four times is a significant finding
that has not previously been identified. Maternal anxiety
appears to be the most influential factor.
The ambiguous presenting symptoms, the serious se-
quela of GOR/GORD combined with an inability to
diagnosis the disease inadvertently leads to over diagno-
sis of GOR/GORD as was identified in this study and
this in turn increases the anxiety of parents. It may be
that inconsistent parenting by anxious, inexperienced
mothers increases infant crying. The fact that primipar-
ous women were more likely to have an infant with
GOR/GORD supports this.
The literature demonstrates that the maternal infant
dyad is particularly at risk in the context of excessive
crying. Several studies have investigated the relation be-
tween excessive crying and maternal depression [67–69],
with more recent literature highlighting the effect of ma-
ternal trait anxiety/psychological distress and anxiety
disorders during pregnancy on excessive infant crying
and emotional problems in childhood [70]. Petzoldt, et
al., [71] found maternal anxiety prior to pregnancy was
associated with an increased risk for excessive crying;
even when adjusting for maternal depression. Maternal
anxiety may lead to intrusiveness that possibly intensifies
infant crying. The association of maternal anxiety disor-
ders and excessive crying was found to be increased
when associated with anxiety provoking incidents occur-
ring during the peri-partum [71].
Excessive crying, feeding and sleeping problems have
been associated with caregiver-infant interactional prob-
lems, a disturbed caregiver–infant relationship, and se-
vere
parental
impairment
and
frustration
[72,
73].
Mothers of infants with feeding difficulties may become
anxious, leading to feelings of failure and fear of rejec-
tion by the infant. Maternal feeding anxiety are reported
to be common in GOR/GORD [74]. The developmental
origins of health and disease hypothesis which suggests
early environmental factors influence mental and phys-
ical health into adulthood has been described [75, 76].
Persistent early regulatory problems (excessive crying >
3 months of age, feeding and/or sleeping difficulties)
have been reported as early markers for subsequent un-
favourable childhood outcomes such as Attention Deficit
Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD) [76].
Towards a new understanding of GOR/GORD
In this study paediatricians and nurses working in the
RPS identified an over diagnosis of GOR/GORD which
might lead to other underlying causes and factors not
being addressed. When feeding back the results of the
study to the paediatricians involved in the focus groups
they identified that the peak in GOR/GORD diagnosis
was around the routine six week postnatal check and in-
dicated this was an another example of possible service
provider influence when it came to diagnosis of GOR/
GORD (Fig. 2).
A major issue in the over diagnosis of GOR as GORD is
the inability or unwillingness of health professionals to dif-
ferentiate between GOR and GORD. GOR in infants is a
normal physiological process. The symptoms of feeding
difficulty, sleeping problems and excessive crying while
usually transient during infancy, may persist into early
childhood [76]. All infants cry in the first few weeks of life,
however more than 25% infants cry > 2 h day. Unfortu-
nately some parents may find it difficult to differentiate
between what is normal and abnormal infant behaviour.
Healthy infants have regurgitation that is physiologic re-
solving without intervention in 95% of the individuals by
12–14 months of age [77, 78]. Feeding difficulties, sleeping
problems and excessive infant crying are the most fre-
quent reasons for parents to consult a doctor [79].
In a study aimed at evaluating the implementation of
the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenter-
ology, Heapatology, and Nutrition (NASPGHAN) guide-
lines [2] for treatment of GOR, Quitadamo et al., [80]
found GORD was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms
irrespective of the age of the child and that 39% of general
paediatricians prescribe proton pump inhibitors’ (PPIs) in
infants with unexplained crying and/or distressed behav-
iour and in infants with uncomplicated recurrent regurgi-
tation and vomiting. Notably PPIs have been found to be
no better than using a placebo in crying babies in the first
few months of life [81, 82]. In addition, there is no simple,
reliable and accurate method for the diagnosis of GORD
[26]. Intra-oesophageal pH monitoring and multichannel
intraluminal impedance and manometry, separately or in
combination, although the most commonly used investi-
gations for GORD correlate poorly with symptoms and
are not reliable diagnostic tools in the infant population
[83]. As a consequence normal regurgitation and normal
crying, or abnormal crying due to a cause other than
GORD, may be mistaken for GORD.
Anxious or inexperienced parents may link infant fussiness
and crying to their own feelings of inadequate parenting
[84]. They fear the existence of some sinister cause for their
infant’s discomfort so seek out a medical rationale for the
infant’s continued unsettled behaviour [85]. Parents faced
with prolonged infant crying, may find their physical and
psychological resources stretched to the extreme. We know
the parent–child relationship can have lasting effects on the
healthy development of the child [84]. In addition, parental
partner relationship quality may suffer as it is closely related
to the well-being of the baby. In light of the adverse impact
of infant crying on the family and infant, and the associated
treatment costs, prevention of such problems is a priority.

 Future research could focus on active normalising of
GOR for parents through a discussion which emphasises
that reflux rarely requires further investigation or treat-
ment. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence
(NICE) guidelines [26] offer recommendations for the
management of the infant with GOR which feature the
stepwise trialling of management strategies to reduce
symptoms of GOR and the avoidance of routine investi-
gation or treatment for GORD until overt signs of
GORD exist [26]. Notably there are no references to psy-
chological and emotional support for parents included
in the guidelines despite the negative effects of adverse
infant behaviour being well documented [86–89]. This
needs to be an urgent focus of future research. Health
care providers such as midwives, neonatal nurses and
child and family health nurses may be better placed to
normalise infant behaviour and reduce over diagnosis.
They also spend more time with parents where conver-
sations can occur that elicit other possible factors.
Limitations
There are several limitations in this study. The advantages
of using population-based datasets and linkage to other
databases include the size of the sample and the high ac-
curacy of a validated dataset. Limitations include the re-
stricted number of variables included and the limited
specific information on potential influencing variables.
The ICD-10-AM codes are also only from hospital admis-
sions and so will underestimate the babies treated for
GOR/GORD at a community level. In addition clinical
coders will look for a diagnoses of GOR/GORD in the
medical records. If a clinician gave the diagnosis then the
record would be coded for that, or if it was in the history
of the patient. The inclusion of the diagnosis by a clinician
in the notes does not mean it is not necessarily confirmed
by test results. A small number of cases with a low linkage
rate (0.3%) were not included meaning that there is the
possibility of missing variables. Previous validation studies
have shown high levels of data accuracy for most of the
diagnoses and procedures conducted during labour and
delivery in the state-wide data base [45, 46]. However, the
recording of medical conditions and smoking tend to be
underreported [45, 47]. There are several other socio-
demographic factors we could not control for, including
education and income that may provide valuable insight
into associated socio-demographics. This study can only
provide an overview of possible associations with GOR/
GORD and does not imply causality. We also do not know
on what basis infants were given a GORD diagnosis as op-
posed to GOR and so we have combined these. This
makes it also really hard to determine the real prevalence
and burden of the problem. The medical records reviewed
in this study were from one year only but the random
sampling increased the reliability. The focus groups were
only undertaken with staff in the NSW RPS and so may
not be representative of views of health professionals in
other services or outside of NSW.
Conclusions
We propose a new way of approaching the GOR/GORD
issue that considers the impact of early birth (immaturity),
disturbance of the microbiome (caesarean section) and
mental health (maternal anxiety in particular). The
current approach of treating a crying baby with anti-reflux
medication may not get to the root cause and therefore
will not address underlying issues leading to the problem.
