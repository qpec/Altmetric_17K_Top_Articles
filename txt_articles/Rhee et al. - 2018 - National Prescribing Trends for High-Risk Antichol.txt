OBJECTIVES: To estimate prescribing tends of and corre-
lates independently associated with high-risk anticholiner-
gic prescriptions in adults aged 65 and older in office-
based outpatient visits.
DESIGN: Repeated cross-sectional analysis.
SETTING: National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey
(NAMCS).
PARTICIPANTS: A national sample of office-based physi-
cian visits by adults aged 65 and older from 2006 to 2015
(n596,996 unweighted).
MEASUREMENTS: Prescriptions of high-risk anticholi-
nergics, regardless of indication, were identified, and over-
all prescribing trends were estimated from 2006 to 2015.
Stratified analyses of prescribing trends according to phy-
sician specialty and anticholinergic drug class were also
performed. We used a multivariable logistic regression
analysis to estimate the odds of high-risk anticholinergic
prescription.
RESULTS: Between 2006 and 2015, a high-risk anticholi-
nergic prescription was listed for 5,876 (6.2%) 96,996 vis-
its of older adults, representative of 14.6 million total
visits nationally. The most common drug classes were
antidepressants,
antimuscarinics,
and
antihistamines,
which accounted for more than 70% of prescribed anti-
cholinergics.
Correlates
independently
associated
with
greater odds of receiving a high-risk anticholinergic pre-
scription were female sex, the Southern geographic region,
specific physician specialties (e.g., psychiatry, urology),
receipt
of
6
or
more
concomitantly
prescribed
medications, and related clinical diagnoses (e.g., urinary
continence) (p<.01 for all).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of high-risk anticholiner-
gic prescriptions was stable over time but varied according
to physician specialty and drug class. Quality prescribing
should be promoted because safer alternatives are avail-
able. J Am Geriatr Soc 66:1382–1387, 2018.

espite a range of clinical indications, medications
with anticholinergic properties pose a number of
risks to older adults. These agents are commonly pre-
scribed for allergies, obstructive pulmonary disease, and
urge urinary incontinence,1,2 but they are associated with
risks of serious adverse events, including cognitive impair-
ment, falls, dementia, and death in older adults.3–12 This
vulnerability to adverse events is due in large part to a
variety of aging-related physiological changes such as poor
hepatic and renal function and blood-brain barrier perme-
ability.13 Although some of these medications rely directly
on anticholinergic action for their therapeutic effect (e.g.,
antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome and antimus-
carinics for urge urinary incontinence),14 others have anti-
cholinergic side effects separate from their therapeutic
action (e.g., antidepressants and antihistamines).
To promote safer prescribing, the recent Beers criteria
identified
52
specific
strong,
high-risk
anticholinergic
agents in 9 major drug classes as potentially inappropriate
medications in older adults and recommended avoidance
of 35 of these 52 drugs regardless of indication.4 On the
basis of a strong recommendation grounded in systematic
reviews of clinical studies, these 35 anticholinergic drugs
are to be avoided regardless of indication.4 Previous stud-
ies investigated anticholinergic use at the national level
but relied on self-reported survey questionnaires from
civilians and used old data and older versions of the Beers

 criteria.11,15 Furthermore, these studies were conducted
cross-sectionally such that they did not investigate secular
trends of prescribing over time. With updated Beers crite-
ria and up-to-date nationally representative survey data
collected from physicians from 2006 to 2015, we investi-
gated whether prescribing patterns have changed over time
and whether these patterns vary according to physician
specialty and anticholinergic class. We also estimated
demographic and clinical correlates independently associ-
ated
with
these
high-risk
anticholinergic
medication
prescriptions.
METHODS
Data Source and Study Sample
We used data from the 2006 to 2015 National Ambula-
tory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCS), an annual cross-
sectional
survey
of
office-based
physician
visits.
The
NAMCS nationally represents ambulatory medical care
services, including prescription trends.16 We limited our
sample
to
all
visits
by
adults
aged
65
and
older
(N5102,806 unweighted). We excluded observations with
any missing covariates (5.7%), which were missing at ran-
dom according to the Little test,17 leaving a final sample
size of 96,996. Because it used publicly available de-
identified data, this study was exempted from institutional
review board review (#2000021850) at Yale University
School of Medicine because no direct human subjects were
involved. Further details of the survey, including descrip-
tions, questionnaires, sampling methodology, and datasets,
are publicly available on the NAMCS website.16
Measures
High-risk anticholinergic medications. We examined
the first 8 medications listed as prescribed for each visit,
ensuring consistency across years. Based on Beers criteria
and the Rudolph anticholinergic risk scale,4,18 we character-
ized use of 35 high-risk anticholinergic medications with
recommendations for complete avoidance: antidepressants
(amitriptyline,
amoxapine,
clomipramine,
desipramine,
imipramine, nortriptyline, paroxetine, protriptyline, tri-
mipramine), antimuscarinics (darifenacin, fesoterodine, fla-
voxate, oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine, trospium),
antihistamines (brompheniramine, carbinoxamine, chlor-
pheniramine, clemastine, cyproheptadine, dexbromphenir-
amine, dexchlorpheniramine, dimenhydrinate, doxylamine,
hydroxyzine, meclizine, triprolidine), skeletal muscle relax-
ants (cyclobenzaprine, orphenadrine), and antispasmodics
(belladonna alkaloids, clidinium-chlordiazepoxide, dicyclo-
mine, hyoscyamine, propantheline).
Clinical Diagnoses
Participating physicians were asked to report the patient’s
reason for visit, the physician’s diagnosis, cause of injury,
and procedures. SRA International Inc. (Durham, NC)19
then independently coded these indications specifically for
NAMCS data collection and not for medical billing. The
NAMCS provides up to 3 clinical diagnoses at each visit
using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth
Revision, Clinical Modification, diagnostic codes. We con-
structed several indicator variables for indications poten-
tially relevant to anticholinergic use: allergic conditions
(287.0, 472.0, 473.0, 473.1, 473.2, 473.3, 473.8, 473.9,

respiratory diseases (491–496); irritable bowel syndromes
(556, except 556.7); overactive bladder (596.51, 788.41,
788.42, 788.63) or urinary incontinence (388.30–388.36,
788.91); neuropathic pain (053.1, 250.6, 338.4, 346, 350,
357.2, 729.1, 729.2, 784.0); parkinsonism, dyskinesia, or
dystonia
(333.71,
333.72,
333.79,
333.81–333.85,
333.89, 333.90, 333.99); vertigo (386, 780.4) or motion
sickness (994.6); cognitive impairment (331.83) or demen-
tia (290, 294.10, 294.11, 294.20, 294.21, 331.19, 331.82,
331.0); other psychiatric disorders (290–319, except cog-
nitive
impairment
and
dementia);
insomnia
(327.00,
327.01, 327.02, 327.09, 780.51, 780.52); dry mouth
(527.7);
blurry
vision
(368.8);
fatigue
(780.71
and
780.79); hypersomnia (780.54) or tachycardia (785.0);
and constipation (564.00–564.02, 564.09).
Covariates
Similar to prior work on potentially inappropriate pre-
scriptions, we selected covariates based on the potential
for clinically relevant confounding.20,21 We included the
following
demographic
variables:
age
(65–74,
74–85,
�85), sex, race and ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic
black,
Hispanic,
other),
geographic
region
(Northeast, Midwest, South, West), primary source of
payment (private, Medicare, Medicaid, other), reason for
visit (acute problem, routine chronic problem, preventive
care, pre- or postsurgery care), and number of repeat visits
within the past 12 months (0, 1–2, 3–5, �6). For clinical
characteristics, variables included20,21 physician specialty
(primary care, psychiatry, neurology, urology, other), time
spent with a doctor (in minutes), number of chronic condi-
tions (<2, �2), and number of concomitant medications
prescribed (<6, �6).
Data Analysis
We determined whether demographic and clinical charac-
teristics differed according to anticholinergic prescription
status using Bonferroni-adjusted bivariate analyses. Then,
we assessed overall trends over the 10-year period in per-
centage of visits with anticholinergic prescriptions using
logistic regression models. Survey year was the main pre-
dictor variable, and we combined years into 2-year inter-
vals, assigning values ranging from 1 to 5 (152005–06,
252007–08, etc.). We transformed this variable by sub-
tracting 1 and dividing by 4, resulting in values between 0
and 1, which allowed us to interpret the odds ratio (OR)
as the change in the odds of anticholinergic prescriptions
over the 10-year period. We repeated these analyses strati-
fied according to physician specialty and anticholinergic
class. Lastly, we used a multivariable-adjusted logistic
regression analysis to identify demographic and clinical
correlates

 anticholinergic medication prescriptions. We performed all
analyses using Stata MP/6-Core version 15.1 (Stata Corp.,
College Station, TX), accounting for the survey sampling
design (e.g., unequal probability of selection, clustering,
stratification).
RESULTS
Selected Characteristics of the Sample
Between 2006 and 2015, records from 5,876 of 96,996
visits (6.2%) by adults aged 65 and older, representative
of 14.6 million visits nationally, listed a high-risk anticho-
linergic prescription. Women, individuals with 2 or more
chronic conditions, those prescribed 6 or more concomi-
tant medications, and those with related clinical diagnoses,
such as overactive bladder or urinary incontinence, neuro-
pathic pain, or vertigo or motion sickness were more
likely to be have a visit in which an anticholinergic was
prescribed (Table 1). Of visits at which anticholinergics
were prescribed, 53.1% were with a primary care pro-
vider, and 11.6% were with a psychiatrist, neurologist, or
urologist.
National Trends of High-Risk Anticholinergic
Prescriptions
Table 2 shows national trends of anticholinergic prescrip-
tions from 2006 to 2015. Overall, the anticholinergic pre-
scription rate increased from 6.1% in 2006–07 to 6.8% in
2008–09 and then decreased to 4.7% in 2014–15. In pri-
mary care visits, the rate decreased over time, from 8.7%
in 2006–07 to 6.4% in 2014–15 (OR across 10-year
period trends50.94, 95% confidence interval (CI)50.89–
0.98). The most common drug classes were antidepres-
sants,
antimuscarinics,
and
antihistamines,
which
accounted for more than 70% of prescribed anticholiner-
gics in any given time interval.
Multivariable Logistic Regression Analysis
Table 3 shows the results of multivariable-adjusted logistic
regression analysis, which was used to estimate the odds
of receiving an anticholinergic medication independent of
other factors. The odds of an older women receiving a
high-risk anticholinergic prescription were 1.88 times as
great as those of an older men (95% CI51.71–2.06,
p<.001). The odds of receiving high-risk anticholinergic
prescriptions were 1.21 times as great in the South as in
the Northeast (95% CI51.05–1.39, p5.007). The odds of
receiving
a high-risk
anticholinergic prescription
were
higher for psychiatry and urology visits than for primary
care visits (p<.001).
The odds of receiving a high-risk anticholinergic pre-
scription was 5.14 times as great for older adults pre-
scribed 6 or more concomitant medications as for those
with fewer than 6 (95% CI54.66–5.68, p<.001). Overac-
tive bladder or urinary incontinence, neuropathic pain,
vertigo or motion sickness, and insomnia were independ-
ently associated with greater odds of receiving a high-risk
anticholinergic prescription (p<.01).
DISCUSSION
This pharmacoepidemiological study investigated predic-
tors of and national prescribing trends in high-risk anti-
cholinergic medications in older adults in a nationally
representative sample of office-based outpatient visits from

 2006 to 2015. The prevalence of visits with any anticholi-
nergics prescribed was stable over time, increasing mini-
mally from 6.1% in 2006–07 to 6.8% in 2008–09 and
then decreasing to 4.7% in 2014–15. These rates are
slightly lower than that of a previous study using 2009–10
Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which reported a prev-
alence rate of 9.6%.15 These marginal differences may be
due to differences in data collection (e.g., individual vs
visit
level)
or
which
medications
were
specifically
included.
Of the selected medication classes, antidepressants
were the most prevalent. A recent study that demonstrated
a near doubling in antidepressant prescriptions from 2002
to 2012 corroborates this.21 Because safer pharmacologi-
cal alternatives with less anticholinergic activity are avail-
able for treatments of depression, anxiety, and insomnia,
for example, safer prescribing practices should be encour-
aged. The multivariable logistic regression analysis shows
demographic and clinical factors independently associated
with the odds of receiving a strong, high-risk anticholiner-
gic prescription. Consistent with previous studies,15,22
women and people in the South were more likely to
receive
a
high-risk
anticholinergic
prescription.
The
regional variation may be because of differences in physi-
cian practices, patient preferences, or formulary structure.
Individuals with 6 or more concomitant medications
prescribed at the sampled visit also had a greater likeli-
hood of having a high-risk anticholinergic prescription.
This may result in serious polypharmacy-related adverse
drug events in older adults. Future research is needed to
determine whether high-risk anticholinergic medications
moderate the relationship between polypharmacy and out-
comes. Such a finding would underscore the need for
reduction in high-risk anticholinergic prescribing in older
adults. In general, there was a greater likelihood of a high-
risk anticholinergic medication being prescribed at a visit
that involved a diagnosis often treated using an anticholi-
nergic (e.g., urinary incontinence). The severity of these
indications may justify prescribing anticholinergics in indi-
viduals, but the risk of these medications merits informed
shared decision-making.
There are several limitations to this study. First,
NAMCS does not capture visits at hospital-affiliated clin-
ics and emergency departments (�8.5% of all outpatient
visits) and excludes prescriptions placed over the tele-
phone. Second, NAMCS selected information based on a
randomly selected visit, which may have resulted in
incomplete
prescription
documentation.
For
instance,
NAMCS does not capture anticholinergic that clinicians
other than the physician at the sampled visit have pre-
scribed. Third, because only generic names of prescribed
medications are provided in the data, we excluded some
drugs from the analysis (e.g., doxepin) because dosing
information is needed to estimate their indications pre-
cisely. For these reasons, our findings may underestimate
the magnitude of anticholinergic prescribing at all time
points.
Despite the limitations, the strengths of our study
include generalizability because of the use of nationally
representative data. In particular, the NAMCS is one of
few
datasets
that
represent

practice

 prescribing patterns in office-based care at the national
level. Despite previous studies that have examined the use
of strong, high-risk anticholinergic use and negative out-
comes (e.g., developing cognitive impairment and demen-
tia, mortality) in older adults, the overall prescribing
trends of these medications remained stable between 2006
and 2015. Our findings highlight that all types of physi-
cians need to decrease prescribing of all classes of high-
risk anticholinergic medications because safer alternatives
are available. The findings from our study lay the founda-
tion for future research to develop and implement better
quality of care practices to reduce high-risk anticholinergic
prescriptions in older adults.
