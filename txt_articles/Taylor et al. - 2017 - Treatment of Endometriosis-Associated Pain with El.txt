BACKGROUND
Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent condition that causes dysmenorrhea 
and pelvic pain. Elagolix, an oral, nonpeptide, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) 
antagonist, produced partial to nearly full estrogen suppression in previous studies.
METHODS
We performed two similar, double-blind, randomized, 6-month phase 3 trials (Elaris Endo-
metriosis I and II [EM-I and EM-II]) to evaluate the effects of two doses of elagolix 
— 150 mg once daily (lower-dose group) and 200 mg twice daily (higher-dose group) — as 
compared with placebo in women with surgically diagnosed endometriosis and moderate 
or severe endometriosis-associated pain. The two primary efficacy end points were the pro-
portion of women who had a clinical response with respect to dysmenorrhea and the propor-
tion who had a clinical response with respect to nonmenstrual pelvic pain at 3 months. Each 
of these end points was measured as a clinically meaningful reduction in the pain score and 
a decreased or stable use of rescue analgesic agents, as recorded in a daily electronic diary.
RESULTS
A total of 872 women underwent randomization in Elaris EM-I and 817 in Elaris EM-II; 
of these women, 653 (74.9%) and 632 (77.4%), respectively, completed the intervention. At 
3 months, a significantly greater proportion of women who received each elagolix dose 
met the clinical response criteria for the two primary end points than did those who re-
ceived placebo. In Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who had a clinical response with 
respect to dysmenorrhea was 46.4% in the lower-dose elagolix group and 75.8% in the 
higher-dose elagolix group, as compared with 19.6% in the placebo group; in Elaris EM-II, 
the corresponding percentages were 43.4% and 72.4%, as compared with 22.7% (P<0.001 
for all comparisons). In Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who had a clinical response 
with respect to nonmenstrual pelvic pain was 50.4% in the lower-dose elagolix group and 
54.5% in the higher-dose elagolix group, as compared with 36.5% in the placebo group 
(P<0.001 for all comparisons); in Elaris EM-II, the corresponding percentages were 49.8% 
and 57.8%, as compared with 36.5% (P 
= 
0.003 and P<0.001, respectively). The responses 
with respect to dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain were sustained at 6 months. 
Women who received elagolix had higher rates of hot flushes (mostly mild or moderate), 
higher levels of serum lipids, and greater decreases from baseline in bone mineral den-
sity than did those who received placebo; there were no adverse endometrial findings.
CONCLUSIONS
Both higher and lower doses of elagolix were effective in improving dysmenorrhea and 
nonmenstrual pelvic pain during a 6-month period in women with endometriosis-asso-
ciated pain. The two doses of elagolix were associated with hypoestrogenic adverse effects.

Treatment of Endometriosis-Associated Pain
E
ndometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-
dependent, inflammatory condition that is 
characterized by the implantation of endo-
metrial-like tissue outside the uterus and affects 
6 to 10% of women of reproductive age.1,2 Endo-
metriosis symptoms include dysmenorrhea, non-
menstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, as well 
as the less common symptoms of pain at ovula-
tion, constipation, and painful urination.1,3 Endo-
metriosis-associated pain can decrease the patient’s 
quality of life and result in substantial economic 
burden.4-7 Dyspareunia can have profound inter-
personal and psychological consequences.8
Endometriosis has multifactorial causes, in-
cluding retrograde menstruation, genetic and 
environmental factors, alteration of the immune 
system, and ectopic differentiation of mesenchy-
mal stem cells.9,10 Estrogen plays a necessary role 
in the pathophysiology of endometriosis,11 since 
it promotes the implantation of endometrial tis-
sue in the peritoneum, has proliferative and anti-
apoptotic effects in endometrial cells, and stim-
ulates local and systemic inflammation.12,13 On 
the basis of the “estrogen threshold hypothesis,” 
complete estrogen suppression may not be need-
ed to control endometriosis-associated pain, and 
estrogen may be adjusted to a level that is ade-
quate to control pain but minimizes hypoestro-
genic effects.14
First-line therapies for endometriosis-related 
pain include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) and progestin-containing oral contra-
ceptives.3 Second-line therapies involve injectable 
depot formulations of gonadotropin-releasing 
hormone (GnRH) agonists, such as leuprolide 
acetate. Although the injectable agents are effec-
tive and reduce estrogen levels to postmenopausal 
levels, they are associated with side effects (e.g., 
progressive bone loss and severe vasomotor symp-
toms), which limit their use to 6 months without 
hormone-replacement therapy.3,15,16 Medical op-
tions remain limited. Progestins are associated 
with bleeding, weight gain, and mood changes,17 
and endometriosis is often associated with pro-
gesterone resistance.18 Androgenic agents such 
as danazol are associated with acne, hirsutism, 
and changes in lipid profiles.19 Surgical ablation 
or excision of lesions can be effective; however, 
symptoms often recur within 12 months, and 
more radical surgery (hysterectomy or oophorec-
tomy) is a last resort.1,20 Pain management usual-
ly requires repeated courses of medical therapies 
or multiple surgical treatments until menopause.3,21
Elagolix is an oral, nonpeptide GnRH antago-
nist. Proof-of-concept phase 2 studies of elagolix 
showed efficacy in controlling both dysmenorrhea 
and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, with an accept-
able safety profile at a dose (once-daily 150 mg) 
that produces partial estrogen suppression.22-24 A 
phase 1 study showed that elagolix (at a dose of 
200 mg twice daily) led to nearly full estrogen 
suppression.25
We performed two similar multicenter, double-
blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 
trials (Elaris Endometriosis I and II [EM-I and 
EM-II]) of 6-month treatment with elagolix at 
two doses in women with moderate or severe 
endometriosis-associated pain.
Methods
Patients
Women underwent randomization for Elaris EM-I 
at 151 sites in the United States and Canada 
from July 2012 through May 2014 and for Elaris 
EM-II at 187 sites on five continents from No-
vember 2013 through July 2015. Premenopausal 
women between the ages of 18 and 49 years who 
had received a surgical diagnosis of endometrio-
sis in the previous 10 years and who had moder-
ate or severe endometriosis-associated pain were 
eligible to participate. (A full list of inclusion 
and exclusion criteria is provided in the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org.) 
Women were excluded if they had a z score of 
less than −1.5 for bone mineral density at the 
lumbar spine, femoral neck, or total hip at 
screening or clinically significant gynecologic 
conditions or chronic pain conditions unrelated 
to endometriosis.
Trial Design and Oversight
Each trial was divided into four intervals: a wash-
out of hormonal therapies (if applicable); a screen-
ing period of up to 100 days, including two 
menstrual cycles, during which women switched 
from the use of usual analgesic agents to receive 
allowed rescue medication of an NSAID (500 mg 
of naproxen), an opioid according to country (e.g., 
5 mg of hydrocodone plus 325 mg of acetamino-
phen), or both (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix); a 6-month treatment period; and a 
follow-up period of up to 12 months, unless the 
woman was enrolled in the corresponding 
6-month extension study (Fig. S1 in the Supple-

mentary Appendix). Here, we report the results 
of the initial 6-month treatment period only.
Eligible women were randomly assigned by 
means of an interactive voice-response system in 
a 2:2:3 ratio to receive 150 mg of elagolix once 
daily (lower-dose group), 200 mg of elagolix twice 
daily (higher-dose group), or placebo. Women 
were instructed to use two forms of nonhor-
monal contraception; monthly pregnancy tests 
were performed. Trial visits were performed on 
day 1 and monthly through 6 months.
The trials were conducted in accordance with 
International Conference on Harmonisation guide-
lines and applicable regulations and ethical prin-
ciples of the Declaration of Helsinki. All the 
women provided written informed consent. The 
sponsor, AbbVie, designed the trials and ana-
lyzed the data; the investigators and the sponsor 
jointly conducted the trials and gathered the data. 
All the authors had full access to the data and 
signed confidentiality agreements with the spon-
sor regarding the data. The first draft of the 
manuscript was written by a medical writer em-
ployed by the sponsor, with input from all the 
authors. All the authors reviewed and provided 
feedback on all subsequent versions of the manu-
script and, along with the sponsor, made the 
decision to submit the manuscript for publica-
tion. All the authors vouch for the completeness 
and accuracy of the data and analyses and for 
the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, available 
at NEJM.org.
Efficacy End Points
The two primary efficacy end points were the 
proportion of women who had a clinical response 
with respect to dysmenorrhea and the proportion 
who had a clinical response with respect to non-
menstrual pelvic pain at 3 months. Each of these 
end points was measured as a clinically mean-
ingful reduction in the pain score (on a scale 
ranging from 0 [no pain] to 3 [severe pain]) and 
a decreased or stable use of rescue analgesic 
agents (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix), as recorded in a daily electronic diary. The 
clinically meaningful threshold for the mean 
change from baseline, as compared with placebo, 
was −0.81 for dysmenorrhea and −0.36 for non-
menstrual pelvic pain in Elaris EM-I and −0.85 
for dysmenorrhea and −0.43 for nonmenstrual 
pelvic pain in Elaris EM-II.
Key secondary efficacy end points were the 
mean changes from baseline to 3 months or 
6 months, which were tested in a hierarchical 
order as follows: the score on the Numeric Rat-
ing Scale (0 [no pain] to 10 [worst pain ever]) at 
3 months, dysmenorrhea at 6 months, nonmen-
strual pelvic pain at 6 months, use of rescue 
analgesic agents (both NSAID and opioid pill 
counts) at 3 months and 6 months, dyspareunia 
(0 [none] to 3 [severe] or not applicable) at 
3 months, and the use of a rescue opioid at 
3 months. All the efficacy assessments and ad-
ditional secondary end points (including the Pa-
tient Global Impression of Change and 30-item 
Endometriosis Health Profile questionnaires) are 
described in Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. Safety evaluations included endometrial 
assessments, measurement of bone mineral den-
sity, and laboratory measures (see the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Statistical Analysis
We calculated that the enrollment of 875 women 
in Elaris EM-I and 788 in Elaris EM-II (with the 
latter adjusted according to the withdrawal rate 
in Elaris EM-I) would provide a power of more 
than 90% to determine the two primary end 
points in each trial, assuming response rates of 
55% in each elagolix group and 29% in the pla-
cebo group, at a two-sided alpha level of 0.025. 
Efficacy and safety analyses were performed in 
the modified intention-to-treat population, which 
included all the women who underwent random-
ization and received at least one dose of elagolix 
or placebo. Mean pain scores were calculated on 
the basis of levels at 35 days before day 1 (base-
line) and levels during each month of treatment. 
We calculated the response thresholds for scores 
with respect to dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual 
pelvic pain before unblinding, with a separate 
analysis of receiver operating characteristics that 
used answers of “much improved” and “very much 
improved” on the Patient Global Impression of 
Change questionnaire at 3 months to determine 
a clinically meaningful response. We calculated 
statistical significance, odds ratios (Table S4 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), and risk ratios 
(in post hoc analyses) on the basis of logistic-
regression models comparing elagolix with pla-
cebo and using the categorization of “response” 
and “no response” as the dependent variable, 
trial group as the main effect, and the baseline 
score for dysmenorrhea or nonmenstrual pelvic 
pain as the covariates. We used the last-observa-
tion-carried-forward method for women who

prematurely discontinued the trial at or before 
3 months. We performed a sensitivity analysis 
with imputation of no response for women who 
discontinued the trial before 3 months. We de-
termined the statistical significance for differ-
ences between each elagolix dose and placebo 
for each key secondary end point from a separate 
mixed-effects model with repeated measures, us-
ing observed data with trial group as the main 
effect, the number of visits as the repeated mea-
sure, the baseline value as a covariate, and an 
interaction between trial group and visit. All re-
ported P values are two-sided, and confidence 
intervals related to the two primary end points 
and sensitivity analyses are reported at the 97.5% 
level.
Adverse events were coded with the use of the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, versions 
18.0 (Elaris EM-I) and 19.0 (Elaris EM-II). We 
used Fisher’s exact test to compare the incidence 
of any adverse event (and of such events accord-
ing to their preferred terms) in each elagolix 
group with the incidence in the placebo group. 
All reported P values are two-sided, and confi-
dence intervals for safety end points are reported 
at the 95% level.
Results
Patients
A total of 872 women underwent randomization 
in Elaris EM-I and 817 in Elaris EM-II; of these 
women, 653 (74.9%) and 632 (77.4%), respectively, 
completed treatment. Details regarding enroll-
ment, follow-up rates, and reasons for trial dis-
continuation are summarized in Figure S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. The trial groups had 
similar demographic and clinical characteristics 
at baseline (Table 1).
Primary Efficacy End Points
At 3 months, the proportion of women who met 
the clinical response criteria for each of the two 
primary end points was significantly greater 
among women who received each elagolix dose 
than among those who received placebo (Fig. 1). 
In Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who 
had a clinically meaningful reduction in dysmen-
orrhea and decreased or stable use of rescue 
analgesic agents was 46.4% in the lower-dose 
group and 75.8% in the higher-dose group, as 
compared with 19.6% in the placebo group; in 
Elaris EM-II, the corresponding percentages 
were 43.4% and 72.4%, as compared with 22.7% 
(P<0.001 for all comparisons). In Elaris EM-I, the 
percentage of women who had a clinically mean-
ingful reduction in nonmenstrual pelvic pain and 
decreased or stable use of rescue analgesic agents 
was 50.4% in the lower-dose group and 54.5% in 
the higher-dose group, as compared with 36.5% 
in the placebo group (P<0.001 for all compari-
sons); in Elaris EM-II, the corresponding per-
centages were 49.8% and 57.8%, as compared 
with 36.5% (P 
= 
0.003 and P<0.001, respectively). 
The results of a sensitivity analysis with imputa-
tion of no response for women who discontinued 
the trial before 3 months were similar to those 
of the primary analysis (Table S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). The responses at 3 months 
with respect to dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual 
pelvic pain were sustained at 6 months.
Secondary Efficacy End Points
As compared with placebo, each elagolix dose 
resulted in a significant reduction from baseline 
to 3 months in endometriosis-associated pain, 
as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale, and 
significant reductions from baseline to 6 months 
in scores with respect to dysmenorrhea and non-
menstrual pelvic pain (Table 2). The reductions 
in dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain 
were apparent at 1 month and were sustained at 
6 months (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). At 3 months and 6 months, women who 
received the higher dose of elagolix were taking 
a significantly lower amount of any rescue analge-
sic agent (as determined by the mean pill counts 
of NSAIDs, opioids, or both) than were those 
who received placebo; women in the lower-dose 
group did not have a significant reduction in the 
use of such agents. After the analysis of the 
rescue-analgesic end point, differences between 
the lower-dose elagolix group and the placebo 
group on the remaining hierarchically tested key 
secondary end points were not considered to be 
significant according to the protocol (Table 2). 
From baseline to 3 months, the mean reductions 
in the dyspareunia score and in the opioid pill 
count were significantly greater in the higher-dose 
elagolix group than in the placebo group (Table 2).
Significantly more women taking either dose of 
elagolix reported “much” or “very much” improve-
ment on the Patient Global Impression of Change 
scale at 6 months than did those taking placebo 
(Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). Elagolix 
treatment resulted in a better quality of life than

did placebo on the basis of the mean change 
from baseline to 3 months and 6 months on the 
30-item Endometriosis Health Profile dimen-
sions. These results differed significantly from 
those with placebo at 3 months and 6 months in 
three of the six dimensions in Elaris EM-I and in 
four of the six dimensions in Elaris EM-II in the 
lower-dose group and in all six dimensions in 
the higher-dose group in both studies (Fig. S4

Figure 1. Reduction in Dysmenorrhea and Nonmenstrual Pelvic Pain.
Shown are the percentages of women in whom the two primary end points (clinically meaningful reduction in dysmenorrhea or in non-
menstrual pelvic pain and decreased or stable use of rescue analgesic agents) were reported at 3 months and 6 months in Elaris EM-I 
(Panel A) and Elaris EM-II (Panel B). In Elaris EM-I, 3-month data are provided for 373 women who received placebo, 248 who received

Treatment of Endometriosis-Associated Pain
Safety
More than 70% of women in each trial group 
reported at least one adverse event, with a sig-
nificant difference in frequency between those 
receiving the higher dose of elagolix and those 
receiving placebo; 10% or less of the women 
discontinued their participation in the trial be-
cause of any adverse event (Table 3). The three 
most frequently reported adverse events in each 
trial were hot flushes, headache, and nausea; the 
incidence of hot flushes was significantly higher 
with each dose of elagolix than with placebo 
(Table 3, and Table S6 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). For the majority of women receiving 
elagolix who reported hot flushes, the maximum 
severity was mild or moderate; discontinuation 
due to hot flushes occurred in less than 1% of the 
women in the lower-dose group and in less than 
3% of those in the higher-dose group (Table S7 
in the Supplementary Appendix). The most fre-
quently reported severe and serious adverse events 
are reported in Table S8 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. There was one death in Elaris EM-II, 
which was due to suicide by overdose with mul-
tiple nontrial medications in a woman who had 
been receiving the lower dose of elagolix for up 
to 31 days (Table 3).
At 6 months in the two trials, mean decreases 
from baseline in bone mineral density at the 
lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip were 
significantly greater in the elagolix groups than 
in the placebo group. The only exception was the 
between-group difference in bone mineral den-
sity at the femoral neck in Elaris EM-I, which was 
not significant in the lower-dose group (Fig. 2). 
In Elaris EM-I, at 6 months, the percentage of 
women with decreases of more than 5% in bone 
mineral density at the lumbar spine was 3.8% in 
the lower-dose elagolix group and 20.9% in the 
higher-dose elagolix group, as compared with 
1.8% in the placebo group; in Elaris EM-II, the 
corresponding percentages were 2.3% and 16.4%, 
as compared with 1.1% (Fig. S5 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix). In Elaris EM-I, the percent-
age of women with z scores for bone mineral 
density at the lumbar spine that were −1.5 or less 
after 6 months of treatment was 1.1% in the 
lower-dose elagolix group and 3.3% in the higher-
dose group, as compared with 0.4% in the pla-
cebo group; in Elaris EM-II, the corresponding 
percentages were 0.6% and 4.9%, as compared 
with no women in the placebo group.
Elagolix treatment was associated with increas-
es from baseline to 6 months in lipid measure-
ments, including total cholesterol, low-density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipo-
protein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides. These 
increases were significantly higher in both elago-
lix groups than in the placebo group, except for 
HDL cholesterol in Elaris EM-I and triglycerides 
in both trials in the lower-dose elagolix groups 
(Table 3). There was a small but significant dif-
ference from placebo in the mean increases from 
baseline to 6 months in the ratio of LDL choles-
terol to HDL cholesterol in the higher-dose group 
in each trial and in Elaris EM-I in the lower-dose 
group (Table 3). Less than 20% of the women 
in each elagolix group had levels of LDL choles-
terol that were more than 160 mg per deciliter 
(4.14 mmol per liter)26 or had levels of triglycer-
ides of more than 200 mg per deciliter (2.26 mmol 
per liter)26 at any time during treatment (Table 3). 
There were no significant differences between 
elagolix and placebo in the mean change from 
baseline to 6 months in the blood glucose level 
(Table S9 in the Supplementary Appendix).
There were numerical decreases from base-
line to 6 months in endometrial thickness with 
elagolix treatment, although there were no statis-
tical comparisons performed for endometrial 
measures; a higher proportion of women in each 
elagolix group had amenorrhea during months 
1 through 6 than in the placebo group (Table S10 
in the Supplementary Appendix). On the basis of 
endometrial-biopsy samples obtained in Elaris 
EM-I, at 6 months a greater proportion of women 
had normal quiescent or minimally stimulated 
endometrial patterns in the elagolix groups than 
in the placebo group; there were no pathological 
findings, including hyperplasia, in either elagolix 
group (Table S11 in the Supplementary Appendix).
There were 23 pregnancies during the interven-
tion period in the two trials. Of the 8 pregnancies 
in the elagolix groups, there were 3 live births 
(with no congenital anomalies), 1 spontaneous 
abortion, 2 terminations of pregnancy, and 
2 losses to follow-up (Table S12 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Discussion
In two large, randomized, placebo-controlled 
trials, we found that women with moderate or 
severe endometriosis-associated pain who received 
two different doses of elagolix had significantly 
lower scores for dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual

Treatment of Endometriosis-Associated Pain
pelvic pain than did those who received placebo 
after 3 months and 6 months of treatment. These 
results were supported by significantly better 
scores for endometriosis-associated pain on the 
Numeric Rating Scale at 3 months among those 
who received elagolix than among those who re-
ceived placebo. In addition, women who received 
the higher dose of elagolix (200 mg twice daily) 
had significantly better results with respect to 
the use of rescue analgesic agents at 3 months 
and 6 months, dyspareunia at 3 months, and 
rescue opioid use at 3 months than did those 
receiving placebo. The observed improvements in 
quality of life were consistent with the primary 
and key secondary end points.
We determined the threshold for a pain-score 
reduction at 3 months with a receiver-operating-
characteristics analysis using the responses on 
the Patient Global Impression of Change ques-
tionnaire, a procedure that is common in pain 
studies27 but novel in this patient population. 
The magnitude of reduction in dysmenorrhea 
with elagolix appeared to be greater than the mag-
nitude of reduction in nonmenstrual pelvic pain; 
dysmenorrhea is mostly dependent on cyclic chang-
es in ovarian hormones, whereas the mechanism 
of nonmenstrual pelvic pain is more complex.28
Oral elagolix had hypoestrogenic effects — 
including reduced bone mineral density, increased 
lipid levels, and an increased incidence of hot 
flushes — that were similar to those of inject-
able GnRH agonists, but the magnitude of the 
effects may differ. Both of the elagolix doses 
had an effect on bone mineral density, and the 
differences were significant as compared with 
placebo, although the difference between the 
lower dose of elagolix and placebo (range, −0.41% 
to −1.28% across measured regions) was smaller 
than that for the higher dose. Differences in the 
mean percent change in bone mineral density 
between the higher dose of elagolix and placebo 
ranged from −1.73% to −3.08% in measured re-
gions, which is equivalent to absolute differ-
ences in the z score of approximately 0.15 to 
0.30.29 In ongoing analyses, we are assessing 
whether these decrements are reversible after the 
discontinuation of elagolix, as has been reported 
with leuprolide acetate.30 After 6 months of 
treatment, fewer than 5% of the women in the 
elagolix groups had a z score of −1.5 or less for 
bone mineral density at the lumbar spine.
There was also a shift in the lipid profile with

elagolix treatment and included both favorable 
changes (increased HDL cholesterol level) and 
unfavorable changes (increased LDL cholesterol 
level). Some data suggest a potential increased 
risk of coronary heart disease in women with 
endometriosis,31 which may be partially associat-
ed with hysterectomy or oophorectomy. Although 
this young population was overall at low risk, it is 
unknown whether these changes in lipid levels 
would affect long-term cardiovascular risk. In 
a small study, a GnRH agonist resulted in a 
similar shift in lipid levels, with a mean increase 
in the LDL cholesterol level of 14.6 mg per deci-
liter (0.38 mmol per liter) after 12 months of 
treatment.32
We found no adverse effects on the endome-
trium after 6 months of elagolix treatment. In 
Elaris EM-I, the percentage of women who had 
normally quiescent or minimally stimulated tis-
sue on endometrial-biopsy samples was greater 
in the elagolix groups than in the placebo group. 
This finding suggests that elagolix was associ-
ated with an antiproliferative effect at each dose 
and with endometrial atrophy at the higher dose, 
which was consistent with decreases in endome-
trial thickness at this dose.
Elagolix did not completely suppress ovulation 
at either of the two doses.25 Although women 
were instructed to use dual nonhormonal contra-
ception, pregnancies were reported during the 
trials. There were no anomalous outcomes in the 
elagolix groups in these trials, but no conclusion 
on the effect of elagolix on pregnancy could be 
made, owing to the small number of pregnancies.
Although we did not perform prespecified 
statistical testing to compare the two elagolix 
doses, women in the higher-dose group had a 
greater reduction in pain and more severe hypoes-
trogenic adverse effects than those in the lower-
dose group, which suggests the possibility of in-
dividual tailoring of these two doses to balance 
efficacy with hypoestrogenic effects. Observed 
reductions in pain and reports of hypoestro-
genic adverse events were consistent with the 
mechanism of action of elagolix, which competi-
tively inhibits GnRH receptors in the pituitary 
gland and leads to a rapid reduction in circulat-
ing gonadotropins and estradiol.25 This mecha-
nism is different from that of GnRH agonists, 
which after an initial stimulatory phase desensi-
tize GnRH receptors in the pituitary and subse-
quently cause depletion of pituitary gonadotro-
pins and full suppression of estradiol to levels 
that are equivalent to those associated with bi-
lateral oophorectomy.33 Agonists are effective in 
reducing both dysmenorrhea and nonmenstrual 
pelvic pain in women with endometriosis.34 How-
ever, the profound estrogen suppression that is 
associated with their use leads to considerable 
hypoestrogenic effects. Such effects limit the

Treatment of Endometriosis-Associated Pain
duration of treatment that can be administered 
without hormone-replacement therapy, and treat-
ment cannot be dose-adjusted to alleviate these 
effects.1,3,32,35,36 For example, treatment with leu-
prolide acetate alone was associated with a mean 
percent decrease from baseline in bone mineral 
density at the lumbar spine of 3.2% at 6 months 
and 6.3% at 12 months; in addition, rates of treat-
ment discontinuation were 6% because of hot 
flushes and 8% because of emotional changes.32
The characteristics of our trial population of 
premenopausal women with endometriosis were 
similar to those of patients in epidemiologic stud-
ies of endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain.37-39 
The safety and efficacy results of Elaris EM-II 
confirmed the results of Elaris EM-I, which 
showed the internal validity. The two trials were 
limited by the entry criteria and length of the 
intervention period. For example, the effect of 
elagolix was not examined in women with a z score 
of less than −1.5 for bone mineral density or in 
women with large endometriomas. Since surgi-
cal diagnoses had occurred within the previous 
10 years, staging of endometriosis was incomplete 
and not used in the analysis. These trials were 
limited to 6 months of treatment; however, long-
term or repeated courses of elagolix are likely to 
be needed for medical management. Data from 
the follow-up periods and 6-month extension 
studies may provide additional information about 
changes in bone mineral density and lipid levels 
over longer durations. We may also learn whether 
the changes associated with elagolix are persis-
tent or whether they can be reversed with the 
discontinuation of treatment, findings that would 
further inform the risk–benefit profiles of each 
dose. Additional evaluation of the overall safety 
profile of multiple courses of treatment with 
elagolix is warranted.
In conclusion, the use of elagolix at two 
doses — 150 mg once daily and 200 mg twice 
daily — resulted in reductions in two of the 
hallmark pain symptoms of endometriosis, dys-
menorrhea and nonmenstrual pelvic pain, after 
both 3 months and 6 months of treatment. Con-
sistent with the mechanism of action, elagolix 
treatment resulted in hypoestrogenic effects, in-
cluding hot flushes and changes in bone mineral 
density and lipid levels.
