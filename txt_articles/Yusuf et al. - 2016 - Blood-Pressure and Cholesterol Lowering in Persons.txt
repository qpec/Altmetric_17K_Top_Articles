BACKGROUND
Elevated blood pressure and elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol increase the 
risk of cardiovascular disease. Lowering both should reduce the risk of cardiovascular 
events substantially.
METHODS
In a trial with 2-by-2 factorial design, we randomly assigned 12,705 participants at inter-
mediate risk who did not have cardiovascular disease to rosuvastatin (10 mg per day) or 
placebo and to candesartan (16 mg per day) plus hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) 
or placebo. In the analyses reported here, we compared the 3180 participants assigned to 
combined therapy (with rosuvastatin and the two antihypertensive agents) with the 3168 
participants assigned to dual placebo. The first coprimary outcome was the composite of 
death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, and 
the second coprimary outcome additionally included heart failure, cardiac arrest, or revas-
cularization. The median follow-up was 5.6 years.
RESULTS
The decrease in the LDL cholesterol level was 33.7 mg per deciliter (0.87 mmol per liter) 
greater in the combined-therapy group than in the dual-placebo group, and the decrease 
in systolic blood pressure was 6.2 mm Hg greater with combined therapy than with dual 
placebo. The first coprimary outcome occurred in 113 participants (3.6%) in the com-
bined-therapy group and in 157 (5.0%) in the dual-placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% 
confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.90; P 
= 
0.005). The second coprimary outcome occurred 
in 136 participants (4.3%) and 187 participants (5.9%), respectively (hazard ratio, 0.72; 
95% CI, 0.57 to 0.89; P 
= 
0.003). Muscle weakness and dizziness were more common in 
the combined-therapy group than in the dual-placebo group, but the overall rate of dis-
continuation of the trial regimen was similar in the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
The combination of rosuvastatin (10 mg per day), candesartan (16 mg per day), and hy-
drochlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) was associated with a significantly lower rate of 
cardiovascular events than dual placebo among persons at intermediate risk who did not 
have cardiovascular disease. (Funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and

Blood-Pressure and Cholesterol Lowering
C
ardiovascular diseases are major 
causes of death and illness worldwide.1 
Both systolic blood pressure and low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol show graded 
associations with cardiovascular disease and to-
gether account for two thirds of the population-
attributable risk of cardiovascular disease.2-4 
Therefore, combined lowering of LDL cholesterol 
and blood pressure can potentially have a bigger 
effect in reducing cardiovascular events than 
either intervention alone. Because the majority 
of cardiovascular events occur in persons at aver-
age risk with no previous cardiovascular disease, 
a strategy of broad population-based treatment 
of LDL cholesterol and blood pressure could be 
more effective than targeting only high-risk per-
sons.5 These considerations form the basis for the 
polypill concept, which theorizes large reduc-
tions in cardiovascular events with systematic 
use of combination-drug therapy in middle-aged 
and older persons in the general population.6,7
We therefore evaluated the effects of a moder-
ate dose of a potent statin (without lipid moni-
toring) versus placebo, a fixed combination of 
moderate doses of an angiotensin-receptor block-
er plus a diuretic (without blood-pressure targets) 
versus placebo, and the combination of both 
treatments versus dual placebo on the preven-
tion of major cardiovascular events. This report 
focuses on the efficacy and safety of the combi-
nation of LDL cholesterol lowering and blood-
pressure lowering versus placebo.
Methods
Trial Design and Oversight
The Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation 
(HOPE)–3 trial is a multicenter, long-term, inter-
national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled trial with a 2-by-2 factorial design. We 
evaluated cholesterol lowering with rosuvastatin 
versus placebo, blood-pressure lowering with a 
combination of candesartan and hydrochloro-
thiazide versus placebo, and the combination of 
lipid and blood-pressure lowering versus dual 
placebo in preventing cardiovascular events 
among persons who did not have cardiovascular 
disease and who were at intermediate risk (de-
fined as an annual risk of major cardiovascular 
events of approximately 1%)8 (Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org). The results of 
the blood-pressure–lowering analysis and the 
lipid-lowering analysis are reported in accom-
panying articles in the Journal.9,10 A detailed de-
scription of the trial methods is provided in the 
article that focuses on the effects of blood-
pressure lowering.
The trial was designed by the steering com-
mittee who, along with staff at the Population 
Health Research Institute, oversaw the conduct 
of the trial, the collection and analysis of the 
data, and the interpretation of the results. The 
first author along with three other authors from 
the Population Health Research Institute had 
full access to the data and vouch for the accu-
racy and completeness of the data and analysis 
and for the fidelity of this report to the protocol. 
The first author drafted the manuscript, and all 
the authors made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. Funding was pro-
vided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Re-
search and AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca provided 
the trial drug, served as a single voting member 
on the 24-member steering committee, and had 
no other role in the trial. The trial was con-
ducted at 228 centers in 21 countries and re-
ceived regulatory and ethics approval for each 
participating site or from a central board that 
provided approval for multiple sites. All partici-
pants provided written informed consent.
Eligibility
The trial included men 55 years of age or older 
and women 65 years of age or older without 
cardiovascular disease and with at least one ad-
ditional risk factor besides age (Table S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). We also included 
women 60 years of age or older who had at least 
two such risk factors. Persons with cardiovascu-
lar disease and those with an indication for or 
contraindication to statins, angiotensin-receptor 
blockers, angiotensin-converting–enzyme inhib-
itors, or thiazide diuretics were excluded. The 
trial did not mandate specific lipid or blood-
pressure levels for entry. Fasting lipid and glu-
cose levels were measured locally to inform 
physicians about participants’ risks, but trial eli-
gibility was based on the uncertainty principle: 
only those with clear indications for or contra-
indications to trial drugs, according to the judg-
ment of the local physician and taking into ac-
count local guidelines and standards of practice, 
were excluded from participation.11

Trial Procedures
Eligible persons entered a single-blind run-in 
phase, during which they received both active 
treatments (for blood-pressure lowering and for 
cholesterol lowering) for 4 weeks. Participants 
who adhered to the regimen and who did not 
have an unacceptable level of adverse events 
were randomly assigned to a fixed combination 
of candesartan (16 mg per day) and hydrochloro-
thiazide (12.5 mg per day) or placebo and to 
rosuvastatin (10 mg per day) or placebo.
Follow-up visits occurred at 6 weeks and 
6 months after randomization and every 6 months 
thereafter. Individualized structured lifestyle 
advice was provided, on the basis of identified 
needs, and blood pressure was recorded at each 
visit in the first year and then annually. Lipid 
levels were measured at baseline in all partici-
pants and at 1 year, at 3 years, and at the end of 
the trial in 10 to 20% of the participants (with 
representation across geographic areas and ra-
cial and ethnic groups) (see the Supplementary 
Appendix for further information). Open-label 
statins could be prescribed at the physicians’ dis-
cretion, in which case trial rosuvastatin or pla-
cebo was discontinued.
Outcomes
All cardiovascular events and cases of new-onset 
diabetes were documented and adjudicated (see 
the Supplementary Appendix). There were two 
coprimary outcomes: the composite of death 
from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocar-
dial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (first copri-
mary outcome) and the composite of these 
events plus resuscitated cardiac arrest, heart 
failure, or revascularization (second coprimary 
outcome). The secondary outcome was the com-
posite of events comprising the second coprimary 
outcome plus angina with evidence of ischemia. 
This outcome was adopted by the steering com-
mittee on July 15, 2015, with no protocol amend-
ment before unblinding of the data on Novem-
ber 3, 2015. At that time, a prespecified renal 
outcome was removed owing to limitations of 
statistical power. Additional prespecified out-
comes included death from any cause, the com-
ponents of the coprimary outcomes, new-onset 
diabetes, cognitive function (in participants ≥70 
years of age), and erectile dysfunction in men. 
The latter two outcomes are not reported here. 
Safety reporting is described in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
With an expected annual event rate of 1% for the 
first coprimary outcome in the dual-placebo 
group, an average duration of follow-up of 
5.5 years, cumulative nonadherence rates of 23%, 
drop-in rates of 11%, and rates of loss to follow-
up of less than 1%, we estimated that a sample 
of 12,700 participants (of whom 6348 would be 
randomly assigned to dual active treatment or 
dual placebo) would give the trial 80% power to 
detect a risk of the coprimary outcomes with 
combination therapy that was at least 35% lower 
than the risk with dual placebo.8 No formal 
power calculations for this analysis were made 
for the comparisons of cholesterol lowering alone 
versus placebo, blood-pressure lowering alone ver-
sus placebo, or cholesterol lowering alone versus 
blood-pressure lowering alone.
The main analyses were performed according 
to the intention-to-treat principle. Survival curves 
were computed with the use of the Kaplan–Meier 
procedure. A Cox proportional-hazards model 
was used to estimate treatment effects and to 
evaluate effects in subgroups. No significant 
interaction between the two treatments was ob-
served. The strategy used to preserve an overall 
type I error rate of 5% for the entire trial is de-
scribed in the Supplementary Appendix; on the 
basis of this strategy, a nominal P value of less 
than 0.05 was used to test both coprimary out-
comes in a comparison of the combined-therapy 
group with the dual-placebo group in the 6348 
trial participants included in these two groups. 
Prespecified hypothesis-based subgroup analy-
ses were conducted according to thirds of base-
line risk (determined by the INTERHEART Risk 
Score),12 of systolic blood pressure, and of LDL 
cholesterol concentration (with P values for trend). 
A post hoc recurrent-events analysis13 was per-
formed to describe the effect on the risk of total 
cardiovascular events.
Results
Trial Participants and Follow-up
A total of 12,705 participants who adhered to 
the regimen and did not have an unacceptable 
level of adverse events during the run-in period 
underwent randomization. Of these, 3180 were 
assigned to candesartan–hydrochlorothiazide plus 
rosuvastatin (combined therapy), 3181 to rosuva-
statin plus placebo, 3176 to candesartan–hydro-
chlorothiazide plus placebo, and 3168 to placebo

plus placebo (Fig. S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix). Baseline characteristics are described in 
Table 1. The mean age of the participants was 
65.7 years, and 46.2% of the participants were 
women. The mean systolic blood pressure was 
138.1 mm Hg, and the mean LDL cholesterol 
level was 127.8 mg per deciliter (3.3 mmol per 
liter). The median follow-up was 5.6 years. At 
the end of the trial, vital status was available for 
12,587 participants (99.1%).
Adherence to Trial Drugs
Among participants who were assigned to re-
ceive candesartan–hydrochlorothiazide and ro-
suvastatin, 83.6% were taking both trial medica-
tions at 2 years, and 74.6% were taking both at 
the end of the trial; the corresponding rates in 
the dual-placebo group were 83.3% and 71.8% 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix). In 
the combined-therapy group, an additional 1.6% 
were taking rosuvastatin only at 2 years, and 
2.9% were taking rosuvastatin only at the end of 
the trial; an additional 1.4% and 1.5% were tak-
ing candesartan–hydrochlorothiazide only at the 
respective visits. In the dual-placebo group, 1.2% 
of the participants were taking the rosuvastatin 
placebo only at 2 years and 1.6% were taking the 
rosuvastatin placebo only at the end of the trial; 
1.9% and 3.5% of the participants, respectively, 
were taking the candesartan–hydrochlorothia-
zide placebo only at the two time points. The use 
of open-label and nontrial drugs is presented in 
Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Blood Pressure and Lipid Levels
On average over the course of the trial, the mean 
systolic blood pressure was lower by 6.2 mm Hg 
in the combined-therapy group than in the dual-
placebo group, the mean diastolic blood pres-
sure was lower by 3.2 mm Hg, and the mean 
LDL cholesterol level was lower by 33.7 mg per 
deciliter (0.87 mmol per liter) (Fig. 1) (P<0.001 
for all comparisons). The difference in blood 
pressure was similar for participants assigned to 
candesartan–hydrochlorothiazide alone versus 
placebo; the difference in LDL cholesterol level 
was similar for participants assigned to rosuva-
statin alone versus placebo.
Clinical Outcomes
The first coprimary outcome occurred in 113 
participants (3.6%) in the combined-therapy 
group and in 157 participants (5.0%) in the dual-
placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.90; P 
= 
0.005; rela-
tive difference, 29%; absolute difference, 1.4 
percentage points; number needed to treat to 
prevent one outcome event, 72) (Table 2, and Fig. 
S9 in the Supplementary Appendix). The second 
coprimary outcome occurred in 136 participants 
(4.3%) in the combined-therapy group and in 
187 (5.9%) in the dual-placebo group (hazard 
ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.89; P 
= 
0.003; rela-
tive difference, 28%; absolute difference, 1.6 
percentage points; number needed to treat, 63) 
(Table 2 and Fig. 2A).
There were also significant between-group dif-
ferences in the incidence of the secondary out-
come (147 participants [4.6%] in the combined-
therapy group vs. 205 [6.5%] in the dual-placebo 
group; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.87; 
P 
= 
0.001) (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix) and in the incidence of any kind of stroke 
(31 participants [1.0%] vs. 55 [1.7%]; hazard 
ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.87; P 
= 
0.009). There 
were 163 deaths in the combined-therapy group 
and 178 in the dual-placebo group; there were 
fewer deaths from cardiovascular causes in the 
combined-group group than in the dual-placebo 
group (75 vs. 91), but no difference was seen in 
the number of deaths from other causes (88 and 
87, respectively) (Table S18 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In a post hoc analysis, there were 
fewer first and recurrent events of the first co-
primary outcome with combined therapy than 
with dual placebo (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.53 
to 0.87; P 
= 
0.002) and fewer first and recurrent 
events of the second coprimary outcome (hazard 
ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.84; P 
= 
0.001).
Subgroup Analyses
There were no significant treatment-by-subgroup 
interactions with respect to the first and second 
coprimary outcomes in the three prespecified 
subgroups defined according to stroke risk, LDL 
cholesterol level, and systolic blood pressure at 
baseline (Fig. S16 and S17 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In a post hoc analysis of the first 
coprimary outcome comparing the upper third 
of systolic blood pressure (>143.5 mm Hg) with 
the lower two thirds, the point estimate for the 
hazard ratio was lower in the upper third (haz-
ard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.85) than in the 
lower two thirds (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 
0.59 to 1.12), although the P value for interaction 
of 0.19 was not nominally significant. There was

pants [3.8%] and 147 [4.6%], respectively; hazard

ence in the risk of the second coprimary out-
come (141 participants [4.4%] with rosuvastatin

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics among the four groups. Data on 
blood pressure were missing for 2 participants in the dual‑placebo group, and data on central core laboratory measurements of low‑density 
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration for 321 in the combined‑therapy group, 335 in the rosuvastatin‑plus‑placebo group, 328 in the 
group assigned to candesartan–hydrochlorothiazide plus placebo, and 323 in the dual‑placebo group. Data on age and sex were complete. 
Data on other characteristics were available for 99.7% or more of the trial participants, except that some laboratory variables measured at 
the central core laboratory had rates of missing data similar to that for LDL cholesterol concentration. To convert the values for cholesterol 
to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259. To convert the values for triglycerides to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.01129. To convert the 
values for glucose to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.05551. To convert the values for creatinine to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4. 
HDL denotes high‑density lipoprotein.

Discussion
In the HOPE-3 trial, which involved a primary 
prevention population at intermediate risk and 
with average lipid and blood pressure levels, 
combination therapy with rosuvastatin (10 mg per 
day), candesartan (16 mg per day), and hydro-
chlorothiazide (12.5 mg per day) for a median of 
5.6 years was associated with a significantly 
lower risk of cardiovascular events than dual pla-
cebo (29% lower relative risk and 1.4-percentage-
point lower absolute risk of the first primary out-
come). The number needed to treat for 5.6 years 
to prevent one event of the first coprimary out-
come was 72, and the number needed to treat to 
prevent one event of the second coprimary out-
come was 63. In a post hoc recurrent-events 
analysis, the benefit was slightly larger.
The reduction in LDL cholesterol concentra-
tion was approximately 33.7 mg per deciliter over 
the course of the trial (which is similar to the 
38.6 mg per deciliter [1.00 mmol per liter] that 
was expected),8 and the reduction in systolic 
blood pressure was 6.2 mm Hg (which is lower 
than the expected 8 mm Hg reduction). Rates of 
adherence to rosuvastatin and to candesartan–
hydrochlorothiazide were high, and so the degree 
of cholesterol and blood-pressure lowering that 
we observed, in a large population treated over 
a median of 5.6 years, is probably more repre-
sentative than that observed in small, short-term 
trials involving persons with elevated blood pres-
sure or high lipid levels. Greater reductions in 
LDL cholesterol and in systolic blood pressure 
could be achieved with a more intensive regimen, 
and the reductions in cardiovascular outcomes 
could be larger,14,15 but the safety of such an ap-
proach would need to be established.
We performed a post hoc subgroup analysis 
comparing participants in the upper third of base-
line systolic blood pressure with those in the low-
er two thirds. Among participants in the upper 
third, the risk of the two coprimary outcomes 
was approximately 40% lower with combined 
therapy than with dual placebo, whereas the 
relative risk was only about 20% lower among 
participants with lower systolic blood pressure. 
Although the test for interaction between these 
two effects was not significant, these results 
(comparing combined therapy with dual placebo) 
are based on only half the entire trial cohort. 
In the overall trial, a significant treatment-by-
subgroup interaction was seen according to thirds 
of baseline systolic blood pressure for the com-
parison of candesartan–hydrochlorothiazide with 
placebo; only those in the highest third of sys-
tolic blood pressure benefited from treatment to 
lower blood pressure.10 These results are consis-
tent with those of two meta-analyses of trials of 
blood-pressure lowering, which showed that 
there was a clear benefit of antihypertensive 
therapy in persons with a systolic blood pressure 
of 140 mm Hg or more but no benefit on cardio-
vascular events (as a composite) in those with 
an initial systolic blood pressure of less than 
140 mm Hg.16,17 By contrast, the effects of rosu-
vastatin in the HOPE-3 trial were independent of 
blood-pressure or lipid levels. These different 
lines of evidence suggest that combination ther-
apy (with a statin and blood-pressure-lowering 
treatment) would perform best in persons with 
elevated blood pressure, whereas statins alone 
would perform best in those without elevated 
blood pressure.
We also found that the rate of myocardial 
infarction was lower in the combined-therapy 
group than in the placebo group (relative differ-
ence, 45%; absolute difference, 0.5 percentage 
points), as was the rate of stroke (relative differ-
ence, 44%; absolute difference, 0.8 percentage 
points). These estimates are similar to those 
from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes 
Trial18 with combined lipid and blood-pressure 
lowering (albeit with a different regimen for 
blood-pressure lowering) but were substantially 
lower than the 80% relative risk reduction pro-
jected by Wald and Law for the effect of a polypill 
(consisting of three blood-pressure-lowering 
agents, a statin, folate, and aspirin).6 We did not 
use three blood-pressure-lowering drugs together 
because of limited data on long-term safety in 
persons without hypertension. Aspirin was not 
used because its role in primary prevention is un-
clear,19 and trials of folate in Western countries 
have been disappointing20 (although in a recent 
trial in China, where dietary folate intake is low, 
stroke rates were reduced21).
There were no significant differences between 
the combined-therapy group and the dual-placebo 
group in the rate of new-onset diabetes, renal 
dysfunction, syncope, liver-function abnormali-
ties, eye problems, or cancers. Although the rates 
of muscle weakness or pain and of dizziness 
were higher in the combined-therapy group than

Blood-Pressure and Cholesterol Lowering
in the dual-placebo group (by 0.9 percentage 
points and 2.2 percentage points, respectively), 
these effects were reversible by temporary dis-
continuation of the trial drug. There was only 
one case of rhabdomyolysis (in the rosuvastatin-
plus-placebo group), which was detected clini-
cally, indicating that there is little need for rou-
tine blood testing with a combined-treatment 
strategy. Furthermore, our approach of selecting 
persons on the basis of age and easily measured 
risk factors means that neither complex screen-
ing nor blood tests are required to initiate treat-
ment with low doses of combination therapy.

ethnic groups from 21 countries with broadly 
consistent benefits and safety.
In conclusion, in the HOPE-3 trial, treatment 
with fixed doses of rosuvastatin and two anti-
hypertensive agents was associated with a signifi-
cantly lower risk of cardiovascular events than 
the risk with placebo among intermediate-risk 
persons without previous cardiovascular disease.
Supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research 
(IR2-91038) and AstraZeneca.
