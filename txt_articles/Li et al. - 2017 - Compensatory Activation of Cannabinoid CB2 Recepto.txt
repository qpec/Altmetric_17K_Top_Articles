The rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) is a relay in the descending pain modulatory system and an important site of endocannabinoid
modulation of pain. Endocannabinoids inhibit GABA release in the RVM, but it is not known whether this effect persists in chronic pain
states. In the present studies, persistent inflammation induced by complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) increased GABAergic miniature
IPSCs (mIPSCs). Endocannabinoid activation of cannabinoid (CB1) receptors known to inhibit presynaptic GABA release was signifi-
cantlyreducedintheRVMofCFA-treatedratscomparedwithnaiverats.ThereductioninCFA-treatedratscorrelatedwithdecreasedCB1
receptor protein expression and function in the RVM. Paradoxically, the nonselective CB1/CB2 receptor agonist WIN55212 inhibited
GABAergic mIPSCs in both naive and CFA-treated rats. However, WIN55212 inhibition was reversed by the CB1 receptor antagonist
rimonabant in naive rats but not in CFA-treated rats. WIN55212-mediated inhibition in CFA-treated rats was blocked by the CB2
receptor-selective antagonist SR144528, indicating that CB2 receptor function in the RVM is increased during persistent inflammation.
Consistent with these results, CB2 receptor agonists AM1241 and GW405833 inhibited GABAergic mIPSC frequency only in CFA-treated
rats,andtheinhibitionwasreversedwithSR144528.Whenadministeredalone,SR144528andanotherCB2receptor-selectiveantagonist
AM630 increased mIPSC frequency in the RVM of CFA-treated rats, indicating that CB2 receptors are tonically activated by endocan-
nabinoids. Our data provide evidence that CB2 receptor function emerges in the RVM in persistent inflammation and that selective CB2
receptor agonists may be useful for treatment of persistent inflammatory pain.

Introduction
Chronic pain affects �30% of the U.S. population (Johannes et
al., 2010) and is a significant public health problem. The treat-
ment of chronic pain has been challenging to date for myriad
reasons, including ineffective drugs and/or serious side effects
with prolonged use of prescribed analgesics (Trang et al., 2015).
However, emerging data indicate that drugs that target the endo-
cannabinoid system might produce analgesia with fewer side ef-
fects compared with opioids, drugs that are considered to be the
gold standard in analgesic treatment (Woodhams et al., 2015).
The endocannabinoid system is comprised of the cannabinoid
receptors (CB1 and CB2), endogenous cannabinoid ligands (en-
docannabinoids) and the enzymes that synthesize and metabolize
endogenous ligands to control the bioavailability of endocan-
nabinoids. Endocannabinoids are synthesized in neurons in re-
sponse to activation of postsynaptic neurons, released and act as
retrograde messengers to inhibit presynaptic neurotransmitter
release (Kreitzer and Regehr, 2002; Wilson and Nicoll, 2002).
CB1 and CB2 receptor inhibitors block endocannabinoid signal-
ing in both central and peripheral sites, promoting and/or pro-
longing hyperalgesia (Richardson et al., 1997; Calignano et al.,

Significance Statement
These studies demonstrate that endocannabinoid signaling to CB1 and CB2 receptors in adult rostral ventromedial medulla is
altered in persistent inflammation. The emergence of CB2 receptor function in the rostral ventromedial medulla provides addi-
tional rationale for the development of CB2 receptor-selective agonists as useful therapeutics for chronic inflammatory pain.

 1998; Meng et al., 1998), indicating that these receptors are po-
tential targets for novel analgesic drugs.
Endocannabinoids are localized throughout the brain and are
known to modulate synapses within the descending pain modu-
latory system that includes the periaqueductal gray (PAG) area
and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM) projections to the spi-
nal cord. This circuit modulates nociceptive transmission path-
ways during acute injury, as well as induction and maintenance of
chronic pain (Ren and Dubner, 2002; Heinricher and Ingram,
2008). Inactivation of the RVM in animal models of neuropathic
and inflammatory pain reveals a potent modulation of nocicep-
tive transmission (Burgess et al., 2002; De Felice et al., 2011;
Cleary and Heinricher, 2013; Havelin et al., 2016), and persistent
inflammation affects the function and activity of RVM neurons
(Hurley and Hammond, 2000, 2001; Guan et al., 2002, 2003;
Cleary and Heinricher, 2013). Cannabinoid receptor agonists
modulate activity of RVM neurons (Meng et al., 1998; Meng and
Johansen, 2004), and these effects are reversed with CB1-selective
antagonists. CB1 receptor activation decreases GABA release
from presynaptic terminals (Vaughan et al., 1999; Atwood et al.,
2012). These actions are similar to the cellular actions of opioids
in the RVM, except that, in contrast to opioids, cannabinoids do
not have postsynaptic effects (Vaughan et al., 1999; Vaughan and
Christie, 2005). This difference in cannabinoid and opioid signal-
ing is interesting in that it suggests a differential mechanism of
cannabinoid-mediated analgesia compared with opioid-induced
modulation of the descending pain pathway. To date, there are
few data regarding how the endocannabinoid system in the RVM
is regulated in chronic pain states. In addition, the effects of CB2
receptor activation on the descending pain modulatory system
are not known, largely due to the fact that CB2 receptors were
thought to be expressed in peripheral tissues. More recent studies
provide evidence that CB2 receptors are expressed in the CNS
(for review, see Atwood and Mackie, 2010; Dhopeshwarkar and
Mackie, 2014). In addition, analgesic effects of drugs that inhibit
degradation of endocannabinoids, thus promoting endocan-
nabinoid actions, are partially reversed with CB2 receptor antag-
onists (Jayamanne et al., 2006; Anderson et al., 2014). The goal of
the present studies was to determine the effects of persistent in-
flammation on endocannabinoid levels and CB1 and CB2 recep-
tor function in the RVM. Our data show that CB1 receptor
function and protein levels are reduced during persistent inflam-
mation without a significant change in endocannabinoid levels.
Furthermore, CB2 receptors modulate GABA release in the RVM
only in rats pretreated with complete Freud’s adjuvant (CFA).
Materials and Methods
Animals. Male Sprague Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories and bred in-
house; postnatal day 30–90) were used. All procedures were performed
in strict accordance with the Guide for the care and use of laboratory
animals as adopted and promulgated by the National Institutes of Health
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of
Oregon Health & Science University.
Persistent inflammation. CFA (heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis
in mineral oil, 1 mg/ml, 0.1 ml volume injected, Sigma-Aldrich) was
injected subcutaneously into the plantar surface of the left hindpaw. The
CFA injection produced an intense tissue inflammation of the hindpaw
characterized by erythema, edema, and hyperalgesia (Iadarola et al.,
1988). Electrophysiological recordings from RVM neurons were made
5–7 d following injections of CFA.
RVM ON-cell labeling. RVM neurons have been previously categorized
into �-opioid-sensitive (presumed ON cells) or �-opioid insensitive
(presumed OFF or NEUTRAL cells) subtypes (Heinricher et al., 2009). A
fluorescent opioid compound dermorphin-AlexaFluor-594 (DERM-
A594) was used to label �-opioid-expressing RVM neurons (Arttamang-
kul et al., 2006; Phillips et al., 2012; Li et al., 2015). Microinjection of
DERM-A594 into RVM was performed as described previously (Li et al.,
2015). Briefly, rats were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (37.5 mg/kg)/
xylazine (7.5 mg/kg) /acepramozine (1.5 mg/kg) mixture (i.p.) and a
23-gauge stainless steel guide cannula was lowered into the RVM (an-
teroposterior: �2.1; mediolateral: 0.0 mm; dorsoventral: �7.9 mm from
lambda). A 31-gauge injection cannula that extended 2 mm beyond the
tip of the guide cannula was inserted and DERM-A594 (150–300 ng/0.5
�l in 32% DMSO and saline) was administered over 100 s. The injection
cannula was left in place for an additional 60 s after injection to minimize
backflow up the cannula tract. The injection and guide cannula were
removed, and the brain was immediately extracted for electrophysiolog-
ical recording.
RVM slice preparation. RVM slice preparation was performed as de-
scribed previously (Li et al., 2015). Rats were deeply anesthetized with
isoflurane and the brains were rapidly removed and placed in N-methyl-
D-glucamine-sucrose-based “cutting buffer” containing the following (in
mM): 52 N-methyl-D-glucamine, 2.5 KCl, 0.5 CaCl2, 10 MgSO4, 1.2
NaH2PO4, 30 NaHCO3, 25 D-dextrose, 75 sucrose, 5 sodium ascorbate, 2
thiourea, 3 sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4, adjusted with HCl and 300–310
mOsm (Zhao et al., 2011; Ting et al., 2014). Coronal slices (180–200 �m)
were cut in 95% O2- and 5% CO2-oxygenated cutting buffer. Slices were
incubated at 35°C in a submerged chamber containing aCSF equilibrated
with 95% O2- and 5% CO2-oxygenated for at least 30 min and main-
tained at room temperature afterward until transfer to a recording cham-
ber maintained at 30°C–31°C. The aCSF contained the following (in
mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2.4 CaCl2, 1.2 MgCl2, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 21.4
NaHCO3, 11.1 D-dextrose, pH 7.4, and the osmolarity was adjusted to
300–310 mOsm.
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. RVM neurons were visualized and
labeled with DERM-A594. Voltage-clamp recordings (holding potential
�70 mV) were made from visually identified RVM ON cells (DERM-
A594-labeled) or unlabeled cells in the whole-cell configuration using an
Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Patch-clamp electrodes
were pulled from borosilicate glass (1.5 mm diameter; WPI) on a two-
stage puller (PP83, Narishige). Pipettes had a resistance of 2–4 M�. IPSCs
were recorded in an intracellular pipette solution containing the follow-
ing (in mM): 140 CsCl, 10 HEPES, 4 MgATP, 3 NaGTP, 1 EGTA, 1 MgCl2,
0.3 CaCl2, pH adjusted to 7.3, with CsOH, 290 mOsm. Series resistance
(�20 M�) was compensated by 70%–80% and continuously monitored
during experiments. A junction potential of �5 mV was corrected during
recording. GABAergic events were isolated in the presence of glutamate
receptor antagonists, NBQX (10 �M) and APV (50 �M). Spontaneous
miniature IPSCs (mIPSCs) were recorded in the presence of 500 nM TTX.
Events were low-pass filtered at 2 kHz and sampled at 10–20 kHz for
on-line and later off-line analysis (Axograph 1.4.3), and individual events
were visually confirmed. Recordings in which access resistance or capac-
itance changed by �15% during the experiment were excluded from data
analysis. One neuron was recorded per slice, and four or five slices were
recorded per rat. Each set of experiments was repeated using at least 3 or
4 distinct rats with no more than 2 cells from a single rat included in a
specific dataset.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis
of endocannabinoids
Reagents and chemicals. Silanized glass 13 � 100 mm tubes, and siliconized
1.7 ml Eppendorf tubes were from Fisher Scientific, formic acid was from JT
Baker, acetonitrile (ACN), methanol, and water were purchased from
BurdickandJackson,trifluoroaceticacidandammoniumacetatewerefrom

amide-d4 were from Cayman Chemical.
The analysis of tissue endocannabinoids was developed adapting
methods previously described (Richardson et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2010). Briefly, RVM slices were weighed and placed into
13 � 100 mm screw-top silanized glass tubes, and 100 �l of 0.02% trif-
luoroacetic acid was added. The slices were sonicated for 30 s in an ice
bath. ACN (4 ml) with 10 ng of 2-arachidonoylglycerol-d5, and 1 ng of

 anandamide-d4 was added. Samples were then vortex mixed for 5 min at
2500 rpm in a multitube vortexer and then placed on ice for 15 min.
Samples were then centrifuged for 15 min at 4°C at 2000 � g to pellet
insoluble material. The supernatant was removed to new silanized 13 �
100 mm culture tube and evaporated to dryness in a speed vacuum
evaporator at 35°C. Dried samples were dissolved in 100 �l of ACN,
transferred to silanized inserts, and 5 �l was injected for analysis. Stan-
dards were prepared identically, except there was no tissue present.
Endocannabinoid content was analyzed using a 5500 Q-TRAP hybrid/
triple quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Applied Biosys-
tems) with electrospray ionization in positive mode. The mass
spectrometer was interfaced to a Shimadzu SIL-20AC XR auto-sampler
followed by 2 LC-20AD XR LC pumps. The instrument was operated
with the following settings: source voltage 5500 kV, GS1 30, GS2 60,
CUR 30, TEM 650, and CAD gas medium. Compounds were quanti-
fied with multiple reaction monitoring and instrument parameters

The 2-AG was monitored using the [M�H]� (m/z 379¡287) and
[M�NH4]� parent ions (m/z 396¡287). 1-AG was monitored as a
coeluting peak with the same multiple reaction monitoring transi-
tions as the 2-AG. Other multiple reaction monitoring transitions
were as follows: 2-arachidonoylglycerol-d5, m/z 401¡287; AEA, m/z
348¡62; anandamide-d4, m/z 352¡66. The gradient mobile phase
was delivered at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min and consisted of two sol-
vents, A: 1 g/L of ammonium acetate, 0.1% formic acid in water; and
B: 1 g/L of ammonium acetate, 0.1% formic acid in 75% methanol:
25% ACN. The initial concentration of solvent B was 45%, which was
held for 1 min, followed by a linear increase to 98% by 11 min, held for
4 min, decreased back to starting 45% B over 0.1 min, and then held
for 7 min, for a total of 22 min. Separation was achieved using a
Kinetex 2.6 � C8 100 Å 150 � 2.1 mm column (Phenomenex) kept at
45°C using a Shimadzu CTO-20AC column oven. Data were acquired
using Analyst 1.6.2 and analyzed with Multi-
quant 3.0.1. Standard curves for the 2-AG
were from 1 to 250 ng per slice; AEA was
10–2500 pg per slice. The relative SD was
�15% for all concentrations.
Western blot. Rats were injected with CFA in
a hindpaw or were left naive to treatment.
Brains were collected 5–7 d later, and RVM
tissue was microdissected and homogenized in
Transmembrane Protein Extraction Reagent
(FIVEphoton Biochemicals) with protease in-
hibitors. After incubating 30 min on ice, lysates
were centrifuged at 13,000 RPM for 10 min and
supernatant was collected. Protein concentra-
tion was determined by BCA protein assay
(Thermo Scientific). Total protein was incu-
bated at 60°C for 10 min and separated by elec-
trophoresis on precast NuPAGE 4%–12%
Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), then transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked
with 5% milk (CB1) or 3% BSA (CB2) in
PBS-T buffer (10.6 mM NaH2PO4, 56.5 mM
Na2HPO4, 70 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH
7.4) at room temperature for 1 h. Blots were
then incubated with rabbit CB1-L15 antibody
(1:500; generous gift from Dr. Ken Mackie, In-
diana University) or rabbit CB2 antibody
(ACR-002, 1:200, Alomone Labs) overnight at
4°C. Membranes were washed with PBS-T and
incubated in goat anti-rabbit secondary anti-
body for 1 h at room temperature (Invitrogen;
1:2000). Immunoreactivity was detected using
SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent
Substrate (Thermo Scientific) and captured
using a FluroChem FC2 (AlphaInnotech).
Analysis was performed using ImageJ software
(National Institutes of Health). CB1 and CB2
receptor bands were analyzed relative to
�-actin bands as a loading control.
Authentication of antibodies. G-protein-
coupled receptor antibodies are notoriously
nonspecific. The CB1-L15 antibody has been
extensively tested using Western blot experi-
ments and detects CB1 receptor bands in the
expected range of 49–62 kDa in rat tissue
(Grimsey et al., 2008). We analyzed the band at
62 kDa. The CB2 antibody recognizes a peptide
sequence in the intracellular third loop, and
these amino acids (228–242) are identical be-
tween rat CB2 and mouse CB2 receptors. Im-
munostaining was reduced in CB2 KO mice
and with preabsorption with the specific im-
mune peptide (Zhang et al., 2014). We con-
firmed that the band (40 kDa) that we analyzed
was reduced with the specific immune peptide in our Western blot ex-
periments. We are still concerned by the fact that we observed multiple
bands with both antibodies in the size range expected for CB1 and CB2
receptors (shown in Fig. 4). We also recognize that testing in neither
mouse KO models nor preabsorption controls is actually an appropriate
control for specificity of antibodies in rat tissue. This is especially a con-
cern for CB2 antibodies (Marchalant et al., 2014). Thus, the lack of
change in CB2 receptor protein levels may indicate that total CB2 recep-
tor protein is not changed, but there are more functional CB2 receptors
on the plasma membrane of terminals in the RVM in CFA-treated rats or
that the CB2 antibody recognizes additional protein(s) in a similar size
range that are not altered by CFA treatment.
qPCR. Rats were injected with CFA in a hindpaw or were left naive to
treatment. Brains were collected 5–7 d later, and RVM tissue was micro-
dissected and flash frozen. RNA was isolated by the Oregon Health &

(mapk6-Rn00581152_m1). Data were collected using QuantStudio 12K
Flex Software version 1.0 (Applied Biosystems). All analysis settings were
set to default. All samples generated Ct values within an acceptable linear
range (between 15 and 30 cycles). Both actb and mapk6 were highly
stable between all 10 samples with variance within 1 Ct. The SD between
replicates was very low with the highest being 0.1.
Chemicals. NBQX, DL-AP5, TTX, and CFA were purchased from
Sigma. DERM-A594 was a generous gift from Dr. Seksiri Arttamangkul
and Dr. John Williams (Vollum Institute, Oregon Health & Science
University). WIN55212, rimonabant (SR141716), N-cyclohexylcarba-
mic acid 3�-(aminocarbonyl)[1,1�-biphenyl]-3-yl ester (URB597),
AM1241, GW405833, AM630, and SR144528 were purchased from Ab-
cam. All chemicals were dissolved according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions and made in stock solution kept in �20°C, then diluted to final
concentration into aCSF on the day of the experiment. Stock solutions of
cannabinoids were prepared in DMSO and diluted using aCSF to a final
concentration of 0.03%–0.1% DMSO and 0.05% BSA to decrease ad-
sorption to the perfusion system. We tested several concentrations of
each cannabinoid agonist and antagonist to determine the concentration
range for in vitro slice experiments. The lipophilicity of the drugs neces-
sitates using higher concentrations than determined in cell culture ex-
periments (Vaughan et al., 1999).
Data analyses. All data are reported as mean � SEM. Unpaired or
paired Student’s t test or Mann–Whitney U test was used in two-group
comparisons where appropriate. One- or two-way ANOVA followed by
Dunnett’s or Sidak multiple-comparisons test was used for comparisons
with more than two groups where appropriate to determine statistical
significance. The criterion for significance was set at *p � 0.05 or **p �
0.001 (GraphPad Prism 6).
Results
GABA release is enhanced in RVM neurons following
persistent inflammation
Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed in DERM-
A594-labeled and unlabeled RVM neurons from naive and CFA-
treated rats 5–7 d after CFA injections. Spontaneous mIPSC
frequency was increased when recording from RVM neurons
from CFA-treated compared with naive rats (Fig. 1). The mIPSC
frequency was increased in both DERM-A594-labeled and unla-
beled RVM neurons to similar extents (two-way ANOVA, cell
type, F(1,34) � 2.28, p � 0.14), and there were no changes in mean
mIPSC amplitude distributions. In addition, no significant dif-
ferences were noted in mean rise time and decay time of the

 mIPSCs (data not shown). The change in
frequency without a significant change in
the mIPSC amplitude or kinetics is consis-
tent with a presynaptic change in GABA
release in RVM caused by persistent
inflammation.
Endocannabinoid activation of CB1
receptors in RVM neurons is reduced
following persistent inflammation
There is evidence that endocannabinoids
tonically inhibit GABA release in adult
RVM neurons (Li et al., 2015). We tested
the hypothesis that the enhanced GABA
release in CFA-treated RVM slices is due
to a reduction in endocannabinoid mod-
ulation of GABA release by CB1 receptors
during persistent inflammation. The se-
lective CB1 receptor antagonist rimon-
abant (also called SR141716, 5 �M) was
used to detect the degree of tonic inhibi-
tion in the RVM. We previously observed
that rimonabant inhibited GABA release
similarly onto DERM-A594-labeled and
unlabeled RVM neurons under control
conditions (Li et al., 2015), and there were
no differences in mIPSC frequency be-
tween the two cell types in CFA-treated
animals (Fig. 1), so the data were com-
bined for the remainder of the experi-
ments. Rimonabant increased mIPSC
frequency in RVM slices from naive ani-
mals (Fig. 2A,C). However, this effect was
absent
in
CFA-treated
animals
(Fig.
2B,C). We did not observe differences in
the effects of rimonabant on mIPSC am-
plitudes (Fig. 2D). These data indicate
that tonic activation of CB1 receptors
does not inhibit GABA release in the RVM
during persistent inflammation.
To determine whether bioavailability
of endocannabinoids is altered by persis-
tent inflammation, a mass spectropho-
tometry lipidomics analysis was used to
examine the levels of 2-AG and AEA using
quantitative LC-MS/MS. There were no
significant differences in 2-AG levels in
RVM tissue between naive (2.9 � 0.4
ng/mg wet weight, tissue from 11 rats) and
CFA-treated animals (2.6 � 0.3 ng/mg
wet weight, tissue from 8 rats; t(17) � 0.46,
p � 0.65). Similarly, AEA levels did not
differ in the RVM between naive (1.2 �
0.2 pg/mg wet weight, n � 11 rats) and
CFA-treated animals (1.1 � 0.1 pg/mg
wet weight, n � 8 rats; t(17) � 0.41,
p � 0.69).
The
fatty-acid
amide
hydrolase
(FAAH) inhibitor URB597 (McKinney
and Cravatt, 2005) was used to examine
whether the hydrolysis of endocannabi-
noids is enhanced in persistent inflamma-
tion. In RVM slices from naive animals,

 URB597 (1 �M) promoted inhibition of
GABAergic mIPSCs (Fig. 3A) but did not
alter mIPSC amplitude (Fig. 3B). The de-
gree of URB597 inhibition of mIPSC fre-
quency was reduced in CFA-treated
animals (Fig. 3C), again without affecting
mIPSC amplitude (Fig. 3D). The inhibi-
tion in mIPSC frequency by URB597 was
significantly different in naive slices com-
pared with CFA-treated slices (Fig. 3E)
without affecting mIPSC amplitude dis-
tributions (Fig. 3F). There were also no
differences in mean rise time and decay
time constant from naive and CFA rat
RVM (data not shown). Thus, endocan-
nabinoids hydrolyzed by FAAH are active
in the RVM of naive rats but have substan-
tially reduced effects in the RVM of CFA-
treated rats. These data further indicate
that increased FAAH activity does not un-
derlie the changes in endocannabinoid
modulation of GABA release in persistent
inflammatory pain.
CB1 receptor function is reduced, but
CB2-mediated inhibition of GABA
release is increased in the RVM in
persistent inflammation
We next determined whether levels of
CB1 or CB2 receptor mRNA or protein in
the RVM were altered as a consequence of
inflammation. Both CB1 and CB2 recep-
tor mRNA was detected by qPCR, but
there was no difference in mRNA expres-
sion of these receptors in the RVM of
CFA-treated compared with naive rats
(Fig. 4A,C). Western blot analysis showed
a significant decrease in the level of CB1
receptor protein in the RVM of CFA-
treated compared with naive rats (Fig.
4B). These data, together with the lack of significant changes in
endocannabinoid levels, imply that inflammatory pain decreases
CB1 receptor expression. We did not observe changes in CB2
protein levels in the predicted size range (Fig. 4D).
To test whether reduced CB1 receptor levels in the RVM of
CFA-treated rats are associated with changes in CB1 receptor
function, the effects of a mixed CB1/CB2 receptor agonist
WIN55212–2 (WIN55212) were examined in RVM slices from
naive and CFA-treated rats. Superfusion of WIN55212 (5 �M)
reduced mIPSC frequency in both naive and CFA-treated slices
(Fig. 5A,B). However, the WIN55212-mediated reduction in
mIPSC frequency was reversed by the selective CB1 receptor an-
tagonist rimonabant (5 �M) only in naive animals. This is consis-
tent with effects of rimonabant alone (Fig. 2). The inhibition of
mIPSC frequency was greater in naive compared with CFA-
treated rats regardless of whether WIN55212 inhibition was mea-
sured from control or after superfusion of rimonabant (Fig.
5C,D). WIN55212 and rimonabant had no effects on mIPSC am-
plitude (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that the
function of CB1 receptors is reduced in RVM neurons during
persistent inflammatory pain.
Because WIN55212 is a mixed CB1/CB2 receptor agonist, the
lack of reversal of WIN55212 inhibition by rimonabant in CFA-
treated rats suggested that WIN55212 activates CB2 receptors in
the CFA-treated rats. To test this hypothesis, the CB2 antagonist
SR144528 (3 �M) was applied before WIN55212 superfusion.
WIN55212 significantly inhibited mIPSC frequency in the pres-
ence of SR144528 in recordings from RVM slices of naive rats
(Fig. 6A), indicating that the effects of WIN55212 were not me-
diated by CB2 receptors. However, WIN55212 had no effect in
the presence of SR144528 in RVM slices from CFA-treated ani-
mals (Fig. 6B). WIN55212-mediated inhibition of mIPSC fre-
quency was also significantly greater in the presence of SR144528
in RVM neurons from naive compared with CFA-treated rats
(Fig. 6C).
We tested the ability of a selective CB2 agonist AM1241
(Malan et al., 2001) to inhibit mIPSC frequency in the RVM.
AM1241 (3 �M) had no effect on RVM neurons from naive ani-
mals (Fig. 7A). However, AM1241 significantly reduced mIPSC
frequency in RVM neurons from CFA-treated animals. The se-
lective CB2 antagonist SR144528 reversed this effect. Inhibition
by AM1241 was significantly increased in CFA-treated compared
with naive animals (Fig. 7B). AM1241 did not change mIPSC
amplitude in RVM neurons from naive (paired t test, t(8) � 1.25,
p � 0.25) or CFA-treated rats (paired t test, t(7) � 0.066, p �
0.95). The kinetics of mIPSCs (rise time and decay constant) were

 not altered by AM1241 in either group (data not shown). We
observed similar results using another CB2 receptor-selective ag-
onist GW405833 (1 �M; Fig. 7C,D).
To further identify whether tonic activity of CB2 receptors
modulate GABA release in CFA-treated RVM slices, we tested
whether the CB2-selective antagonists SR144528 and AM630 had
effects on presynaptic GABA release alone. In RVM slices from
naive rats, SR144528 (3 �M) did not alter mIPSC frequency. In
contrast, SR144528 significantly increased mIPSC frequency re-
corded from RVM neurons in CFA-treated rats (Fig. 8A). Similar
results were obtained with another selective CB2 antagonist
AM630 where mIPSC frequencies were increased only in RVM
neurons from CFA-treated rats (Fig. 8B). These data indicate
there is tonic activation of CB2 receptors by endocannabinoids in
CFA-treated rats.
Discussion
The RVM is an integral brainstem relay for the descending mod-
ulation of pain (Heinricher and Ingram, 2008). In vivo single-unit
recordings have shown that RVM neurons are dynamically mod-
ulated in adult rats in the transition from acute to chronic inflam-
mation (Cleary and Heinricher, 2013). The present studies
addressed whether GABAA-mediated synaptic currents and en-
docannabinoid inhibition of GABAergic synaptic transmission
are modulated in the RVM of adult rats during persistent inflam-
mation. We observed increased GABA release and reduced tonic
inhibition by endocannabinoid activation of CB1 receptors in
the RVM of CFA-treated rats. We also show evidence for an
emergence of CB2 receptor actions in the RVM after persistent
inflammation.
Modulation of GABA release in the RVM during
persistent inflammation
GABA signaling is integral to the coordination and activation of
the descending pain circuit. Opioid-induced inhibition of GABA
release disinhibits PAG and RVM output neurons (Heinricher
and Ingram, 2008; Lau and Vaughan, 2014) and microinjection
of GABAA receptor antagonists in either area results in antinoci-
ception (Moreau and Fields, 1986; Heinricher and Tortorici,
1994; Bobeck et al., 2009). Altered GABA release in the PAG
and RVM is associated with chronic inflammatory or neurop-
athic pain models, although both increases and decreases in
GABAergic mIPSCs have been reported (Hahm et al., 2011;
Zhang et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2013) indicating the complexity
of the changes in the descending pain circuit. One key variable in
these studies may be age of animals that are used for recording as
we have previously reported a marked decrease in GABA release
probability between neonatal and adult RVM neurons that is the
result of increased endocannabinoid tone in the adult rat RVM
(Li et al., 2015). Other laboratories have also observed important
differences in the function of the RVM between neonatal and
adult rats (Hathway et al., 2009, 2012). We focused our studies on
adult rats to understand modulation of endocannabinoid signal-
ing in the RVM during persistent inflammation.
Cannabinoid modulation of the descending pain pathway
Cannabinoid-mediated antinociception involves brainstem cir-
cuitry similar to that mediating opioid analgesia (Meng et al.,
1998; Meng and Johansen, 2004). Indeed, cannabinoids inhibit
GABA release in the PAG and RVM, as do opioids (Vaughan et
al., 1999, 2000). Antinociception mediated by systemic adminis-
tration of the nonselective CB1 and CB2 agonist WIN55212 is
blocked by inactivation of the RVM with the GABAA receptor
agonist muscimol, indicating that the RVM contributes to the
analgesic effects of cannabinoids (Meng et al., 1998). Further,
WIN55212 modulates RVM ON and OFF cells similarly to opi-
oids (Meng and Johansen, 2004), supporting the idea that canna-
binoid activation of the descending pain pathway occurs via a
mechanism similar to opioids. The present studies show that
the CB1-selective antagonist rimonabant increased GABAergic
mIPSCs onto both putative ON (DERM-A594-labeled) and
OFF (unlabeled) RVM neurons providing evidence for a tonic
cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of GABA terminals in adult
RVM. This is consistent with a previous report that both RVM
ON- and OFF-cell firing activity were modulated following sys-
temic administration of a CB1 receptor antagonist during in vivo
microelectrode recordings (Meng et al., 1998). However, inhibi-
tion of GABA release would be expected to increase firing of both
cell types, but ON cells exhibit reduced activity in the presence of
cannabinoid agonists (Meng et al., 1998; Meng and Johansen,
2004). Cannabinoid agonists produce their effects via presynap-
tic actions (Vaughan et al., 1999; Atwood et al., 2012), so a direct
postsynaptic effect of cannabinoid agonists on RVM ON cells is
not likely. A more plausible explanation is that there are CB1
receptors on glutamatergic afferents to RVM ON cells or changes
in other neurons within the descending pain circuit. Glutamate
receptor activation is required for the RVM ON-cell burst in
response to a nociceptive stimulus (Heinricher and Roychowd-
hury, 1997; Heinricher and McGaraughty, 1998), and cannabi-

 noid agonists also inhibit glutamate release in the PAG (Vaughan
and Christie, 2000). Future experiments will test the role of can-
nabinoid modulation of glutamatergic inputs in the adult RVM.
Loss of CB1 receptor function during
persistent inflammation
The present studies provide evidence that CB1 receptors are
downregulated during persistent inflammation. In naive rats,
superfusion of the selective CB1 antagonist rimonabant signifi-
cantly increased GABAergic mIPSC frequency. However, in
CFA-treated rats, rimonabant had a reduced effect on mIPSC
frequency. In addition, lower CB1 receptor levels were detected
by Western blot analysis, suggesting that CB1 receptors are
downregulated in the adult rat RVM during persistent inflamma-
tion. Our data are consistent with the loss of CB1 receptor func-
tion and protein levels in the PAG following chronic constriction
injury (CCI), a neuropathic pain model (Palazzo et al., 2012).
Other groups have reported desensitized and/or reduced CB1
levels following sustained or repeated cannabinoid administra-
tion (Sim et al., 1996; Breivogel et al., 1999; Dudok et al., 2015).
Given that it has been reported that both AEA and 2-AG levels are
significantly increased in the RVM 3–7 d after CCI (Petrosino et
al., 2007), we hypothesized that reduced CB1 receptor function
was the result of increased bioavailability of endocannabinoids
and desensitization or downregulation of CB1 receptors. How-
ever, we did not observe changes in AEA or 2-AG levels in the
RVM of CFA-treated animals compared with naive rats. There-
fore, the mechanism underlying the loss of CB1 receptor levels
and function following persistent inflammation remains to be
elucidated. The difference in results from this study using a
model of persistent inflammation and the previous study using
CCI (Petrosino et al., 2007) indicates that endocannabinoid reg-
ulation in the RVM may be different depending on the chronic
pain model. Nonetheless, CB1 receptor function is compromised
in both CCI and persistent inflammation.
Emergence of CB2 receptor actions in RVM during
persistent inflammation
Early reports characterizing the CB receptor system indicated
that CB1 receptors are localized to the CNS and that CB2 recep-
tors are localized to peripheral tissues, including the immune
system and bone. More recently, numerous functional and ana-
tomical evidence suggests that CB2 receptors are expressed in the
nervous system (for review, see Atwood and Mackie, 2010). Both
receptors are implicated in analgesic actions of cannabinoids
(Malan et al., 2001; Jayamanne et al., 2006; Anderson et al., 2014),
and CB2 receptors are dramatically upregulated in the spinal cord
and periphery in inflammatory (Beltramo et al., 2006; Burston et
al., 2013) and neuropathic (Ibrahim et al., 2003; Zhang et al.,
2003; Sagar et al., 2005; Guindon and Hohmann, 2008) pain
models. CB2 receptors also play an important role in inhibiting
chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain (Rahn et al., 2008;
Deng et al., 2015a). We observed functional effects of selective
CB2 agonists and antagonists in the RVM of CFA-treated rats
that were not present in RVM recordings from naive rats. These
data suggest that CB2 receptors are upregulated or may be traf-
ficked to the plasma membrane of RVM neurons in persistent
inflammation. We did not find an increase in CB2 mRNA in the
RVM in CFA-treated rats (although CB2 receptor mRNA was
detected in the RVM) or an increase in CB2 protein levels using
Western blot analysis. However, both mRNA and protein levels
were low in RVM due to the low expression levels of CB2 recep-
tors and poor specificity of detection methods (Marchalant et al.,
2014; Li and Kim, 2015). The lack of changes in mRNA expres-
sion of both CB1 and CB2 receptors is consistent with the func-
tional data showing effects of both receptors on presynaptic
GABA release. Presynaptic receptors are probably expressed in
neurons outside of the RVM and trafficked to terminals project-
ing into the RVM.
An alternative hypothesis is that the emergence of CB2 recep-
tor function may be a result of CB2 receptors expressed on mi-
croglia and other cells in the immune system (Stella, 2010).
CB2 modulation of microglial activity has been observed in the
periphery (Romero-Sandoval and Eisenach, 2007; Romero-
Sandoval et al., 2008), as well as in the CNS (Racz et al., 2008;
Luongo et al., 2010). Future studies will test the role of microglial
activation in the CB2-mediated actions in adult RVM to deter-
mine whether inhibition is mediated by direct effects of CB2
receptors on presynaptic release or indirect modulation of release
via neural-immune interactions.
Implications for pain modulation
The psychoactive ingredients of Cannabis and synthetic can-
nabinoid receptor agonists have analgesic activity in animal
models of acute and chronic pain (Mackie, 2006), as well as in
humans (Rukwied et al., 2003; Holdcroft et al., 2006; Ashton
and Milligan, 2008). Altered descending control from the
RVM has been implicated in chronic pain states (De Felice et
al., 2011; Cleary and Heinricher, 2013). Importantly, our re-
sults showing increased function of CB2 receptor modulation
of GABA signaling in CFA-treated RVM neurons suggest that
selective activation of CB2 receptors may have therapeutic
potential for treating persistent inflammatory pain. An addi-
tional benefit is that CB2 receptor agonists have a lower pro-
pensity than CB1 receptor agonists to induce tolerance and
withdrawal effects (Deng et al., 2015b) and psychotropic side
effects (Mackie, 2006; Atwood and Mackie, 2010; Parsons and
Hurd, 2015).
