Introduction
A very exciting time exists in the field of thoracic
malignancies. In the past year, we have witnessed
tremendous advances in thoracic cancer research and
treatment. In this annual report, now in its second year,
we are pleased and excited to bring together leaders in the
field to summarize recent major breakthroughs and sig-
nificant advances in prevention and early detection, mo-
lecular diagnostics, pathology, staging, surgery, adjuvant
therapy, radiotherapy (RT), molecular targeted therapy,
and immunotherapy. Important progress has been made
in SCLC and malignant mesothelioma and has also been
included.
With
more
novel
treatment
options,
we
reviewed the quality and value of such therapy, and lastly,
a perspective on emerging trends and future directions in
lung cancer research and treatment is provided.
Prevention and Early Detection
Cigarettes, E-cigarettes, and Cannabis
Section Authors: Emily C. A. Stone, M.B.B.S., MMed,
K. Michael Cummings, PhD, MPH, James R. Jett, MD
Cigarettes. Tobacco cigarettes account for the vast ma-
jority of tobacco consumed worldwide and are by far the
most lethal type of tobacco product consumed, costing
global economies $1 trillion annually through loss of
productivity and health care expenditure.1 Tobacco con-
trol interventions such as higher taxes, graphic health
warnings, mass media campaigns, and bans have led to a
fall in smoking rates in developed countries, but less so in
low-income countries where the tobacco industry is
building market share. However, when such declines in
smoking rates do occur, they result more from reduced
youth uptake than from smoking cessation. Smokers are
clearly looking for viable options to move away from
cigarettes, but until recently few alternatives were avail-
able. The rapid uptake of e-cigarettes by smokers over the
past decade has posed some interesting challenges for the
medical profession. Will these new nicotine delivery
products offer smokers an escape from cigarettes? Will
nonsmokers (especially the young) be led into smoking?
Another issue confronting the lung health field is the
movement to legalize cannabis, which appears to be
changing how cannabis is perceived and used, which in
turn could have important health consequences in the
future.
E-cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are a
form of electronic nicotine delivery that has emerged as a
potential alternative to conventional tobacco cigarettes
and as a possible aid to tobacco cessation. A newly pub-
lished systematic review identifies the need for frequent
reevaluation of evidence in a field characterized by rapid
change.2 The regulatory status of the e-cigarette industry,
an industry appropriated by global tobacco companies,
varies around the world, with restrictions ranging from
minimum age of purchase to a ban on sales altogether.3
Although it does appear that e-cigarettes can help some
smokers quit or reduce their smoking, the evidence is
mixed. The recent U.S. surgeon general’s report on
e-cigarettes discourages the sale and use of any nicotine-
containing product by nonsmokers, especially the young.4
Conversely, Public Health England cited e-cigarettes as
“95% safer” than tobacco cigarettes, identifying their
adoption by smokers as a key strategy for tobacco
cessation.5 A 2016 Cochrane review of e-cigarettes for
smoking cessation identified two studies that showed
an increased chance of smoking cessation with the use
of nicotine e-cigarettes compared with nicotine-free
e-cigarettes, but acknowledged a lack of evidence for
long-term safety.6 The likelihood of cigarette cessation
was shown to be lower in those using e-cigarettes
compared with other methods in a recent small study of
patients with cancer.7 A 2014 review of e-cigarettes in
patients with lung cancer noted the urgency of smoking
cessation after a diagnosis of lung cancer, but advised
against recommending e-cigarette uptake after diagnosis,
given the lack of safety and efficacy data.8
Cannabis. Cannabis, also known as marijuana, has been
legalized in 28 states in the United States for medical
purposes. Recreational cannabis use is now permitted in
eight states and Washington, DC. A number of states
have also decriminalized possession of small amounts
for
personal
use.
Similar
legalization
efforts
have
occurred in Canada, Uruguay, Germany, Israel, and other
countries. Between 2002 and 2014, the prevalence of
cannabis use in the past 30 days in the United States
increased by 35%. In 2014, 8.4% of those 12 years of age
and older reported use of cannabis in the past 30 days
and 3.5% reported daily use.9

 Cannabis is most commonly smoked but can be vaped,
ingested, or used topically. Cannabinoids enter the
bloodstream and reach the brain within seconds to a few
minutes when smoked. Oral ingestion of cannabis takes
30 minutes or longer to have its effects in the brain.
The most recent and most comprehensive review of
the health effects of cannabis use was recently published
by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,
and Medicine.10 There is at least moderate evidence that
cannabis is beneficial for chronic pain, neuropathic pain,
and muscle spasms, especially related to multiple scle-
rosis.11–14 There is also moderate evidence that cannabis
improves nausea and vomiting related to chemotherapy.
There is less certain evidence that cannabis can increase
appetite and prevent weight loss.12,15
Cannabis use has been found to impair driving ability,
increase drowsiness, cause addiction in approximately
10% of users, and increase psychotic episodes and
hyperemesis in heavy long-term users.10,15,16
Cannabis smoke contains many of the same toxins as
tobacco smoke, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
Studies have shown that frequent cannabis use can cause
chronic bronchitis (cough, sputum, and wheeze), but there
is no established causality with chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease.17,18 There is also no conclusive evidence
that cannabis use increases the risk for lung cancer,
although cannabis users often smoke cigarettes, making it
difficult to isolate the impact of regular cannabis use on
the risks for chronic lung disease.19–21 The best evaluation
of the association between smoking cannabis and lung
cancer risk, after adjustment for tobacco use, is a pooled
analysis of six case-control studies with 2159 patients
with lung cancer and 2985 controls that failed to find
evidence of an increased risk for lung cancer among long-
term cannabis smokers.20 Given the changing potency and
patterns of use of cannabis, including use by non–cigarette
smokers, there is an urgent need to conduct research to
assess its effects on lung health.11
Lung Cancer Screening
Section Authors: John K. Field, PhD, FRCPath.,
Harry J. M. Groen, MD, PhD, James L. Mulshine, MD
This is a very dynamic time for both computed
tomography (CT)-based lung cancer screening research
and the process of clinical implementation of routine CT
lung cancer screening. Notable improvements in efficient
screening detection rates have been reported, thus
addressing concerns about
high false
positivity
in
screening work-ups. These reports, including the British
pilot study UKLS,22 the NELSON trial group study,23,24 the
I-ELCAP
study,25
and
the
preliminary
experiences
with the American College of Radiology LungRADS
approach,26,27 cite false-positive diagnostic detection
rates of less than 10%. In addition, the field recognized
that nonstandardized terms for characterizing efficiency
of the screening process were also confusing. Some
investigators consider the finding of lung nodules on a CT
scan as being equivalent to a cancer diagnosis, and
because lung nodules are common in smokers, this
misconception has resulted in the perception of a high
false diagnosis rate. From a screening subject perspective,
this situation leads to unnecessary distress; however, this
situation in lung cancer screening could benefit from ed-
ucation for subjects and those involved in screening about
the fact that pulmonary nodules are not equivalent to lung
cancer, most pulmonary nodules are benign in origin, and
lung cancer is a pathologic diagnosis rather than an im-
aging diagnosis. A consensus is emerging that working
toward more systematic definitions for key parameters
for a lung cancer screening is a near-term priority that
could reset screening subjects’s expectations and reduce
anxiety regarding the process.24,28–35
Additional areas of progress include a number of
research efforts to effectively integrate tobacco cessa-
tion, both as a service and as a research focus, within the
process of lung cancer screening.36,37 Dr. Jamie Ostroff of
Memorial Sloan Kettering Institute is leading an exciting
new research effort to address this vital aspect of lung
cancer screening research.
A major Canadian effort buttressed the growing
evidence on the cost-efficiency of providing high-quality
lung cancer screening services while still providing a
public health benefit.38,39 When conservative assump-
tions were used, an analysis of screening benefit was
favorable relative to its impact on person-years of
life saved. However, each nation has to make its own
decision relative to the complex array of health priorities
in each distinctive national setting.
Pathology and Staging
Pathology and Diagnostics
Section Authors: Yasushi Yatabe, MD, PhD, Lukas
Bubendorf, MD, Sanja Dacic, MD, PhD
The acquisition of appropriate tumor material is
crucial for accurate diagnosis and molecular testing of
lung cancer. To meet the clinical demand, new methods
have been developed. Electromagnetic navigation bron-
choscopy using assisted CT allows precise targeting
of peripheral nodules,40 whereas transbronchial cryo-
biopsy
is
a
promising
tool
to
obtain
large
and
high-quality specimens.41 Several studies have reported
that cytologic specimens obtained by endobronchial
ultrasound–guided transbronchial needle aspiration or
fine-needle aspiration are equally suitable for molecular
testing.42 The upcoming molecular testing guideline has
been updated to include newer targetable genes (ROS1,
rearranged during transfection proto-oncogene [RET],

and
advances
in
technology,
including liquid biopsy and next-generation sequencing;
as well as to reaffirm or update the previous recom-
mendations. The draft was published on the College of
American Pathologists, International Association for the
Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), and Association for
Molecular Pathology websites for open comment,43 and
publication of the final recommendations is planned
in 2017.
In addition to the traditional specimens, liquid
biopsies (especially circulating tumor cell DNA [ctDNA])
have been increasingly used in clinical practice. Although
the liquid biopsy has been investigated for use in rela-
tion to various targetable genes in NSCLC, it is mainly
used in the detection of EGFR mutations when there is
inadequate tumor sample or when the risk associated
with biopsy is high. Although plasma EGFR testing has
high specificity, the main concerns remain concordance
with tissue biopsy results and its relatively low sensi-
tivity, especially for T790M. This situation has improved
with the use of advanced next-generation sequencing
platforms.44–49 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has recently approved the cobas EGFR Mutation
Test v2 plasma-based assay as a companion diagnostic
for erlotinib.50 If the plasma EGFR results are negative,
tissue-based testing should be performed.51 Saliva and
urine have also been used to detect EGFR mutations.
Clinically, immune checkpoint inhibitors provide an
additional treatment option in advanced NSCLC, and
programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohisto-
chemistry (IHC) is used as a biomarker to select patients
who are more likely to respond to such treatment in
either the first- or second-line setting.52,53 However, the
development of different PD-L1 IHC assays with indi-
vidual cutoff values, antibodies, and platforms for the
immune
checkpoint
inhibitors
has
raised
concerns
among pathologists and oncologists (Table 1).54–56 To
obtain some clarity, the five individual assays have been,
and are currently being, compared with one another.57–62
Among
these
studies,
first
insights
for
possible
harmonization of different PD-L1 IHC assays were
provided with the BluePrint project, which was con-
ducted in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies,
diagnostic partners, the American Association for Cancer
Research, and the IASLC. Three clones (22C3, 28-8, and
SP263) showed similar results in tumor cell staining,
whereas the SP142 assay displayed significantly less
tumor cell staining. All assays stained immune cells with
greater variability than tumor cells.57 Recently, tumor
mutation burden was focused on as an alternative
predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint inhibitor
treatment, as a high nonsynonymous mutational load is
expected to lead to more tumor-specific T-cell responses
though expression of neoantigens.63 Indeed, the mutation
burden enriched the patients who benefit from first-line
therapy
with
nivolumab,
and
the
combination
of
mutation burden plus high PD-L1 expression appeared to
be more predictive.64

 intrathotracic metastasis remain unchanged.70 Single
extrathoracic metastasis is now classified as M1b sepa-
rately from multiple extrathoracic metastases as M1c.71
Amendments
were
made
to
stage
grouping,72
as
well as to classification of lung cancers with multiple
lesions.73–76 Overall survival (OS) by clinical stage
according to the seventh and eigth editions is shown in
Figure 1.
The revised TNM classification for mesothelioma
includes combination of T1a and T1b into the new T1
category,77,78 collapse of N1 and N2 into the category N1,
and reclassification of N3 as N2.79 The M categories
remain unchanged and stage grouping has been modified
for improved stratification.80
The TNM classification of thymic epithelial malig-
nancies was a joint effort of the IASLC and the Interna-
tional Thymic Malignancies Interest Group.81 The T
component is classified
according
to
the involved
organs.82 Nodal involvement is divided into N1 (anterior
[perithymic] nodes) and N2 (deep intrathoracic or
supraclavicular nodes).83,84 Stages I, II, IIIA, and IIIB are
based on increasing local organ invasion, with stage IVA,
including N1 and M1a (separate pleural or pericardial
nodules) and stage IVB including N2 and M1b (intra-
pulmonary or distant organ metastasis).85
For esophageal and esophagogastric junction cancers
(cancers with their epicenter within the proximal 2 cm of
the cardia),86 tumors were staged clinically,87 patholog-
ically,88 or pathologically after induction treatment.89
This edition included subdivision of T4 into T4a and
T4b depending on invaded organ; differentiation of
clinical and pathologic stages for squamous and adeno-
carcinoma;
introduction
of
pathologic
stages
after
induction for both cancers; and introduction of prog-
nostic subgroups based on anatomic extent, location, and

Minimally Invasive Lobectomy. Over the past 2 de-
cades,
video-assisted
thoracic
surgery
(VATS)
has
become a common surgical technique. Along with it came
improvements in operative and visual instruments.
Although definition of VATS has been conflicting, VATS
generally means operating by using thoracoscopy with a
minimal number of small incisions and without rib
spreading. Treatment of lung cancer by VATS has been
performed under the assumption that it has an oncologic
outcome equivalent to that of open thoracotomy but is a
less invasive method. However, scientifically supported
comparisons between VATS and open thoracotomy
with randomized controlled trials have been scarcely
reported. Some studies using large national or regional
databases have reported that VATS had a lower incidence
of postoperative complications or shorter length of hos-
pital stay by 1 to 2 days, but there is uncertainty as to

 whether this is clinically meaningful.93–96 On the other
hand, some reports concluded that a higher incidence of
nodal upstaging has been observed in thoracotomy than
in VATS, indicating the possibility of insufficient nodal
evaluation in VATS.97,98 Of note, these conclusions were
derived
from
retrospective
studies;
therefore,
they
always harbor hidden biases that may affect the outcome.
A
randomized
controlled
trial
from
Denmark
concluded that VATS was associated with less post-
operative pain and better quality of life (QOL) compared
with thoracotomy for the first year after surgery.99 This
study focused on the self-reported scoring systems of
pain and QOL as outcomes. Further randomized studies
that compare VATS to thoracotomy would be required to
definitively demonstrate the prognostic equivalence and
any differences in QOL or postoperative complications
for these two surgical modalities.
Robot-assisted thoracic surgery (RATS) is defined as
a surgical procedure that utilizes a robotic system for all
or mostly all of the crucial aspects of the operation. In a
recent retrospective study, RATS was reported to be
equivalent to VATS in all measures of quality for treat-
ment of lung cancer.100 To date, no randomized trials
have reported the comparative data between RATS and
VATS/thoracotomy for lung cancer.101
The extent of parenchymal resection remains an area
of evolution. There are several situations where sublobar
resection should be considered as primary treatment for
early-stage NSCLC. In patients with limited pulmonary
reserve or with poor physical conditions, sublobar
resection, either as segmentectomy or wedge resection,
can be reasonably selected as a surrogate for lobectomy.
In cases of multiple primary NSCLCs, sublobar resections
should be considered as well. Of course, there are
anatomic limitations for such resection; however, there is
no doubt that such surrogate resections could be selected.
Surgical Quality. The importance of surgical quality
measures (QMs) in NSCLC was highlighted in 2016. Two
independent studies from the National Cancer Database
found that compliance with basic QMs was associated
with improved OS after NSCLC resections. A study
examining stage I NSCLC looked at (1) anatomic resec-
tion, (2) operation within 8 weeks of diagnosis, (3) R0
resection, and (4) more than 10 lymph nodes sampled.
Whereas 99% of resections met at least one QM, only
22% satisfied all four. Median OS varied from 31 to 89
months for those who met no QMs as opposed to four
QMs.102 Similarly, in clinical stage IIIA, adherence to four
QMs (neoadjuvant therapy, lobectomy or more extensive
procedure, R0 resection, and >10 lymph nodes sampled)
was examined and only 12.8% of stage IIIA resections
satisfied all QMs. Median OS varied from 12 to 43.5
months for those who met no QMs compared with for
those who met four.103 Compliance with QMs was
associated with age, insurance type, hospital volume, and
comorbidity score but remained a strong independent
predictor of survival in both studies. The benefit of
thorough
thoracic
lymphadenectomy
in
early-stage
NSCLC was further emphasized with multiple meta-
analysis and population-based studies demonstrating
improved OS when greater numbers of lymph nodes
were resected and examined.104–108

Cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy is the stan-
dard of care for patients with resected stage II and IIIA
NSCLC and is commonly used for patients with larger (at
least 4 cm) stage IB tumors. In 2016 we learned from a
subset analysis of the E1505 trial that the four platinum-
based doublets utilized (cisplatin with either vinorelbine,
gemcitabine, docetaxel, or pemetrexed) had comparable
efficacy but differing toxicity profiles.109 Further data
to support the 4-cm cutoff to recommend adjuvant
chemotherapy came from a propensity score–matched
analysis performed in the Republic of Korea that divided
stage IB patients into those with tumors 3 cm or smaller
with visceral pleural invasion, tumors 3 to 4 cm in size,
and tumors 4 to 5 cm in size. The study reported that the
only group with a clear differential benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy was that with tumors 4 to 5 cm in size.110
A Chinese study that utilized carboplatin/docetaxel and
randomized nearly 200 patients to preoperative or
postoperative therapy was presented at the IASLC World
Conference on Lung Cancer 2016.111 Both disease-free
survival and OS trended in favor of the adjuvant
approach, but the trial was too small to draw any
definitive conclusions and leaves us with continued
questions about the ideal strategy. Recent studies with
strategies including the addition of bevacizumab in
E1505 and the use of the MAGE-A3 vaccine in MAGRIT
failed to demonstrate any improvement in survival with
these approaches.109,112

EGFR-mutated subset (n ¼ 161) disease-free survival
favored erlotinib (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.61 [not signifi-
cant]); OS did not trend favorably but was immature.

Locally Advanced Stage III Disease. The standard of
care for locally advanced NSCLC remains concurrent
platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation to 60 to 66
Gy.114 The PROCLAIM study evaluated two concurrent
chemotherapy
schemes,
pemetrexed-cisplatin
versus
cisplatin-etoposide,
with
thoracic
radiation
therapy
(TRT) in stage IIIA/IIIB nonsquamous NSCLC. Survival
with
pemetrexed-cisplatin-TRT
was
not
superior,
although grade 3 or lower neutropenia occurred less
frequently in the pemetrexed arm.115 A randomized
study comparing intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) with
passively scattered proton therapy reported no differ-
ences in the primary study end point of treatment failure
(defined as either local progression or grade 3 or higher
radiation pneumonitis).116 Secondary analyses of the
RTOG 0617 study found less high-grade pneumonitis,
lower cardiac doses with use of IMRT versus three-
dimensional conformal radiation therapy,117 and also
less clinically meaningful decline in QOL with IMRT.118
SBRT for Early-Stage and Oligometastatic Disease. The
impact of stereotactic body RT (SBRT) for peripheral early-
stage NSCLC is reflected in a Surveillance, Epidemiology,
and End Results analysis showing that RT utilization rates
for stage IA NSCLC increased from 13% to 29% between
2004 and 2012, with significant improvements in OS in the
RT cohort.119 A systematic review reported only limited
changes in health-related QOL after SBRT.120 For patients
with centrally located lung tumors, both a prospective
trial121 and a literature overview122 suggested that the
toxicity rates of SBRT were acceptable, but the HILUS trial
reported significant rates of fatal hemoptysis.123 Mature
data from prospective trials of SBRT for central tumors are
awaited. In stage IV oligometastatic NSCLC (one to three
metastatic lesions), a randomized phase II trial in patients
not progressing after first-line systemic therapy demon-
strated a significant improvement in progression-free
survival (PFS) with local consolidative therapy (chemo-
radiotherapy or resection of all lesions) compared
with standard therapy (11.9 months versus 3.9 months,
log-rank p ¼ 0.0054).124
Use of WBRT in NSCLC. Brain metastases will develop in
up to 50% of patients with NSCLC.125,126 In selected pa-
tients, surgery or radiosurgery offers the best results.
However, patients with large-volume metastatic brain
disease have traditionally been treated with whole
brain RT (WBRT). In the QUARTZ trial, 538 patients with
brain metastases from NSCLC who were ineligible for
surgery or radiosurgery were randomized to WBRT (20
Gy in five fractions) or best supportive care.127 The pri-
mary outcome measure was quality-adjusted life-years,
and no differences in OS, QOL, or dexamethasone use were
observed between the two groups. This study provides
evidence
that
poor
prognosis
patients
with
brain
metastases
from
NSCLC
do
not
benefit
from
WBRT. However, the QUARTZ data are not applicable
to younger patients, those with limited extracranial dis-
ease, and those for whom radiosurgery remains an option.
ALK

New-Generation TKIs. Currently, ceritinib and alectinib
are approved by the U.S. FDA as subsequent treatment
options after crizotinib failure in ALK-positive patients.
Several recent trials have provided clinical data on these
drugs in the crizotinib-naive setting. In the ASCEND-4
study, which was a phase 3 study comparing ceritinib
with chemotherapy, the median PFS was 16.6 months for
ceritinib compared with 8.1 months for chemotherapy
(HR ¼ 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42–0.73,
p < 0.00001).128 The randomized phase 3 J-ALEX study
compared alectinib, 300 mg twice daily, and crizotinib in
Japanese patients without prior ALK inhibitor treatment.
Alectinib
was
significantly
superior
to
crizotinib,
with PFS not reached versus 10.8 months, respectively
(HR ¼ 0.34).129 Results from a global phase 3 study
(ALEX study) comparing alectinib, 600 mg twice daily,
and crizotinib will likely be reported soon. Lorlatinib and
brigatinib
showed
efficacy
in
patients
with
brain
metastasis
and/or
resistant
mutations,
including
G1202R.130,131 Phase 3 trials comparing these agents
with crizotinib are ongoing.
ALK Resistance and Sequencing of Therapies. Re-
sistance to first- and second-generation ALK TKIs may
occur through ALK-dependent mechanisms (primarily
ALK kinase secondary mutations or amplification) or
ALK-independent mechanisms, including activation of
oncogenic bypass tracts or cell lineage change (small cell
or
epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transformations).132,133
Recently, Gainor et al. extensively characterized muta-
tions in post-TKI biopsy specimens and identified dif-
ferences in the frequency and
type of secondary
mutations
occurring
in
patients
progressing
while
receiving crizotinib compared with second-generation
ALK TKIs.134 Secondary ALK mutations were present in

 20% to 30% of patients progressing while taking crizo-
tinib compared with in more than 50% of patients pro-
gressing during treatment with a second-generation ALK
TKI. Mutations such as L1196M and G1269A were
frequent in post–crizotinib treatment biopsy specimens;
they were less common after treatment with second-
generation
ALK
TKIs.
In
contrast,
G1202R,
which
was found in only 2% of post–crizotinib treatment
specimens, was the most frequent mutation after treat-
ment with second-generation TKIs. Interestingly, the
mutation profile of tumors changes with time and with
the influence of sequential ALK TKIs.134,135 Although the
empirical use of sequential ALK TKIs such as crizotinib
followed by ceritinib or alectinib has resulted in long-
term disease control and excellent survival, character-
ization of resistance mechanisms by using serial tumor
biopsy specimens has potential to guide selection of
multiple, sequential lines of ALK inhibitor therapy.136,137
For example, the I1171 mutation that is associated with
resistance to crizotinib and alectinib may be sensitive to
ceritinib; alternatively, the G1202R mutation that is
associated with resistance to crizotinib, alectinib, and
ceritinib may be sensitive to the third-generation ALK
TKI lorlatinib.130
EGFR

Yang, MD, PhD, Lecia V. Sequist, MD
The optimal treatment for patients with EGFR muta-
tions continued to be refined in 2016. Key research
findings centered around comparing first-line EGFR
TKIs, solidifying the role of the newly approved osi-
mertinib for acquired resistance, developing novel EGFR
TKIs, and using plasma to genotype EGFR.
The LUX-Lung 7 trial compared first-line afatinib to
geftinib among patients with EGFR mutation. A slight
PFS benefit for afatinib (HR ¼ 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57–0.95,
p ¼ 0.017) was seen, but the median PFS was 11 months
in both arms.138 Furthermore the OS was similar in both
treatment arms, including analyses within exon 19
deletion and L858R.139 At this time, whether there are
clear differences between the first-line EGFR TKIs is
unclear; therefore, afatinib, erlotinib, and gefitinib are all
reasonable options.
In November 2015, osimertinib became the first U.S.
FDA–approved
T790M
mutant–specific,
wild-type–
sparing (third-generation) EGFR TKI. This year we saw
mature results from two large single-arm phase II
studies of osimertinib, 80 mg daily, in patients with
T790M-mediated acquired resistance. The AURA exten-
sion and AURA2 trials showed overall response rates
(ORRs) of 62% and 58%, disease control rates (DCRs)
of 90% and 92%, and PFS times of 12.3 and 9.9
months, respectively.140,141 The phase III AURA3 trial
randomized 419 EGFR-mutant patients with T790M
after failure of first-line EGFR TKIs to osimertinib or
platinum/pemetrexed; the PFS times were 10.1 and 4.4
months, respectively (HR ¼ 0.30, 95% CI: 0.23–0.41,
p < 0.001).142
Osimertinib may also have unique central nervous
system activity.143 EGFR-mutant patients (EGFR T790M
not required) with leptomeningeal disease were treated
with osimertinib, 160 mg (BLOOM study).144 Nine of 20
patients had radiographic responses; improvements in
neurologic examination findings and declining levels of
ctDNA in the cerebrospinal fluid were also reported.
Promising PFS was seen with first-line osimertinib in
patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC,145 and the results of
a phase III study comparing osimertinib to erlotinib/
gefitinib (FLAURA) are greatly anticipated.
The need for tissue rebiopsy to determine T790M
status can be a barrier to appropriate treatment selec-
tion. Plasma detection and semiquantitation of the acti-
vating EGFR and T790M mutation is a useful tool to
predict the efficacy of osimertinib,146 and an assay for
T790M in ctDNA was U.S. FDA–approved in 2016 as a
companion diagnostic to osimertinib. Novel techniques
for T790M detection in both plasma and urine have been
studied,147 and minimally invasive assays are expected
to gain prominence in the future.
Updates regarding several other novel EGFR TKIs
were published in 2016.148 Olmutinib was approved in
the Republic of Korea, but global development has been
halted. EGF816149 and ASP8273150 are active in T790M-
positive patients. Rociletinib development has ceased
owing to low activity in T790M-positive patients.151,152
A novel EGFR TKI, AZD3759, has increased central
nervous
system
penetration
but
does
not
inhibit
T790M.153,154
Finally, although immune therapy checkpoint in-
hibitors have had a huge impact in advanced NSCLC in
2016, the studies to date show little if any benefit for
EGFR mutation-positive patients.155–157
ROS1
Section Authors: Alice Shaw, MD, PhD, Myung-Ju
Ahn, MD, PhD
Resistance to crizotinib develops in almost all
patients with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. Although the
mechanisms of acquired resistance are incompletely
understood, several case series of repeat biopsies with
supporting preclinical studies have identified missense
mutations within the ROS1 kinase domain, such as
G2032R,158 D2033N,159 S1986Y/F,160 and L2155S,161
which can mediate crizotinib resistance. The ROS1
G2032R mutation, which is located at the solvent
front of the kinase hinge, confers high-level resistance
to crizotinib and appears to be the most common

 resistance mechanism in crizotinib-treated patients.162
Preclinical studies suggest that cabozantinib,163 fore-
tinib,164 and lorlatinib165 may be able to overcome this
resistance mutation. The ROS1 D2033N resistance
mutation was identified in a patient with CD74 molecule
gene (CD74)-ROS1 fusion who relapsed while taking
crizotinib. Like G2032R, D2033N is located at the sol-
vent front of the kinase hinge. Notably, this patient was

 highly responsive to the multitargeted inhibitor cabo-
zantinib, experiencing a rapid and durable clinical
response.159 Recently, a dual ROS1 kinase domain mu-
tation, S1986Y and S1986F, was discovered in a ROS1-
positive patient who had relapsed while receiving cri-
zotinib. This patient subsequently responded to lorla-
tinib.160 Finally, the novel resistance mutation, L2155S,
was identified in crizotinib-resistant HCC78 cell lines
harboring the solute carrier family 34 member 2 gene
(SLC34A2)-ROS1 fusion.161 Whether this ROS1 mutation
will emerge in patients exposed to crizotinib remains to
be determined. To date, the lorlatinib phase 1/2 trial
represents the largest study to examine patients with
crizotinib-resistant, ROS1-positive NSCLC. Preliminary
data suggest that lorlatinib can induce responses in
some patients, but ROS1 mutation status in these re-
sponders has not been reported.130 A newer next-
generation ROS1 inhibitor, TPX-0005, will soon enter
phase 1 clinical testing. TPX-0005 has been specifically
designed to overcome the solvent front mutations in
ALK and ROS1, including ROS1 G2032R.166 In addition to
secondary mutations within ROS1, several different off-
target mechanisms of resistance have also been re-
ported in crizotinib-resistant tumors, including a KIT
proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase gene (KIT)
D816G activating mutation167 and EGFR pathway acti-
vation.168 Further studies of crizotinib-resistant tumor
specimens are needed to fully define the spectrum of
on-target and off-target resistance mechanisms in ROS1-
positive NSCLC. Elucidating these mechanisms may
inform the rational development of new treatment
strategies for crizotinib-resistant, ROS1-positive NSCLC.
Other Targets
Section Authors: Daniel B. Costa, MD, PhD, Jyoti D.
Patel, MD
Although in 2016 approval of TKIs matched to a
driver was restricted to tumors with genomic aberra-
tions in EGFR, ALK and ROS1,169–175 other putative driver
events could predict for response to targeted therapies
in advanced NSCLC, particularly in lung adenocarcinoma
(Table 3176–189).
The genotype/inhibitor duo closest to receiving
approval by the U.S. FDA and other worldwide regula-
tory agencies is the BRAF V600E mutation (found in
w1% to 2% of adenocarcinomas) with dabrafenib plus
trametinib, as the ORR of this BRAF plus MEK inhibitor
combination is higher than 60% and is associated with
prolonged
disease
control.176–178,190
The
European
Union approved the aforementioned combination in
April 2017 and the FDA in June 2017.
Another promising treatable target is MET proto-
oncogene
receptor
tyrosine
kinase,
which
is
also
known as hepatocyte growth factor receptor. MET can be
activated as a primary oncogenic driver in NSCLC by two
independent mechanisms: high-level MET gene amplifi-
cation (in w1% of adenocarcinomas) and MET exon 14
alterations (in w3%–4% of adenocarcinomas and >10%
of sarcomatoid carcinomas).191–197 Crizotinib, the U.S.
FDA–approved ALK/ROS1/MET TKI, induces responses
in close to half of patients with advanced cancers with
MET alterations,179,180,198 and there are ongoing clinical
trials of multiple other multitargeted MET TKIs (see
Table 3).
The activity of TKI monotherapy in other subgroups
of lung cancer is less clear.199,200 The oncogene rear-
ranged during transfection (RET) is seen in approxi-
mately 1% to 2% of patients with NSCLC; however,
the ORR is less than 30% with the currently available
multitargeted RET TKIs.181–184,201,202 ErbB2 receptor
tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2 or HER2) exon 20 mutations
occur in approximately 2% of lung adenocarcinomas.
Currently available ERBB TKIs and monoclonal anti-
bodies are minimally active and seldom reach an ORR
higher than 20%.186–188,203,204 More specific TKIs and
rational
combination
approaches185
may
hold
the
promise of eventually leading to regulatory approval of
precision therapies in these tumors (see Table 3).

 The drug development platform for driver oncogenes
with a prevalence less than 1% in lung cancer, such
as neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) or
fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) rearrange-
ments,189,205–207 is more challenging (see Table 3) and
may require large umbrella or basket trials that capture
different molecular subgroups of lung cancer, such as
Lung-MAP (NCT02154490) and the U.K. National Lung
Matrix (NCT02664935), or that involve multiple cancer
primaries binned by molecular alterations, such as
NCI-MATCH (NCT02465060).208
Immunotherapy
Section Authors: Leora Horn, MD, MSc, Scott
Gettinger, MD, Solange Peters, MD, PhD
In 2016 the first anti–PD-L1 antibody, atezolizumab,
received approval as a second-line treatment option for
patients with metastatic NSCLC that provides a signifi-
cant improvement in OS compared with docetaxel (13.8
versus 9.6 months, HR ¼ 0.73, p ¼ 0.0003).209 Contrary
to the data on nivolumab in patients with nonsquamous
NSCLC,156 the data on atezolizumab demonstrated a
significant benefit in patients with tumors that were
negative for PD-L1 expression. However, this may be due
to the differential sensitivity between the complimentary
diagnostic antibody approved for atezolizumab (SP142)
and both the companion diagnostic approved for pem-
brolizumab (22C3) and the complimentary diagnostic
approved
for
nivolumab
(28-8).57
Pembrolizumab
became the first checkpoint inhibitor to be approved as a
first-line treatment option for patients with newly
diagnosed stage IV NSCLC, with a superior PFS (10.3
versus 6.0, HR ¼ 0.50, p < 0.001), OS (HR ¼ 0.60,
p ¼ 0.005), health-related QOL, and time to deterioration
for dyspnea, cough, and chest pain compared with
platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with tumors
that were EGFR and ALK negative and strongly PD-L1–
positive (�50%).210,211 A similarly designed study did
not show efficacy when nivolumab was compared with
chemotherapy; however, in this first-line study, patients
with tumors expressing PD-L1 at a lower level of
expression (>1% of tumor cells) were enrolled.212 First-
line avelumab demonstrated efficacy similar to that of
currently approved agents, with a 21.2% RR and PFS
of 4.2 months (95% CI: 2.8–5.6) in an unselected cohort
of patients with NSCLC.213
Benefit with EGFR/ALK Positivity. The role of immu-
notherapy, and in particular, immune checkpoint in-
hibitors, in EGFR mutant and ALK-rearranged NSCLC, has
yet to be determined. Retrospective subset analyses from
several trials suggest lower rates of response to PD-1 axis
inhibitors, without better outcome than standard second-
line chemotherapy.214–216 That said, some patients benefit
from such therapy, as demonstrated in the CheckMate 012
trial. One arm of this trial, 20 patients with EGFR-mutant
NSCLC and acquired resistance to EGFR TKI therapy as
last therapy were treated with erlotinib and nivolumab;
four experienced prolonged tumor regression.217 Combi-
nation therapy was tolerated well; however, increased
toxicity, particularly pneumonitis, has been suggested
with other TKI and PD-L1 axis inhibitor combinations.218
Additional arms on the CheckMate 012 trial evaluated
combination therapy with nivolumab and ipilimumab;
among eight patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC, four
achieved response.219 Less clinical information exists
concerning ALK rearranged NSCLC, although preclinical
studies suggest intrinsic PD-L1 upregulation in such tu-
mors, and responsiveness to PD-1 axis inhibition.220
Currently, whether high tumor PD-L1 expression trumps
EGFR or ALK status is uncertain. One retrospective anal-
ysis suggested this may not to be the case, with poor
outcome with pembrolizumab among 19 patients with
high PD-L1–expressing EGFR-mutant NSCLC.221
Immunotherapy: Novel Combinations and Future
Directions. Immune escape is a critical gateway to
malignancy. Although the recent clinical developments in
immunotherapy for lung cancer have improved the
outcome of patients with metastatic disease, further
improvements are still required. So what approaches
can
be
taken
to
improve
outcomes?
Combination
therapy with nivolumab, every 2 weeks, and ipilimumab,
every 12 or 6 weeks, has demonstrated promising
results with increasing response rates (RRs) compared
with nivolumab alone, 47%, 38%, and 23%, respectively,
and durable responses, albeit with a higher number of
grade 3 and grade 4 adverse events.219 Combination stra-
tegies with both anti–PD-1 or anti–PD-L1 inhibitors and
anti–cytotoxic T-lymphocyte associated protein 4 are being
explored further in phase II and III clinical trials
(NCT02477826,
NCT02659059,
NCT02542293,
and
NCT02453282). To further build on successes of the PD-1/
PD-L1blockadeandtakeadvantageofthemultiplenegative
feedback mechanisms that regulate the adaptive immune
response, numerous clinical trials of immunotherapy
combinations are in progress. New modulatory monoclonal
antibodies are currently being tested in phase I or II
in NSCLC or solid tumors, including lymphocyte activation
gene 3 (NCT01968109/NCT02460224), hepatitis A virus
cellular receptor 2 (NCT02817633/NCT02608268), tumor
necrosis factor superfamily member 4 (NCT02318394/
NCT02410512), tumor necrosis factor receptor superfam-
ily member 18 (NCT02583165/NCT02697591), and indo-
leamine
2,3-dioxygenase
inhibitors
(NCT02460367).
Finally, a small phase II trial demonstrated superior RRs

29%)
and

 p ¼ 0.0205]) for patients treated with pembrolizumab plus
pemetrexed and carboplatin compared with chemotherapy
alone, with a similar incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse
events.222 This led to the U.S. FDA giving accelerated
approval for pembrolizumab in combination with peme-
trexed and carboplatin for the first-line treatment of met-
astatic
nonsquamous
NSCLC
irrespective
of
PD-L1
expression. Multiple trials comparing this approach are
ongoing.
The second approach is designing studies that target
specific
defects
in
the
cancer-immune
interaction.
Currently mutational burden,63 tumor-infiltrating lym-
phocytes,223 and high PD-L1224 expression in the tumor
microenvironment are associated with sensitivity to
immune checkpoint inhibition. Therefore, research efforts
should be directed at mapping the state of the cancer
immune interaction in a comprehensive manner.225
A third approach is to create publicly available, open
source inventories of large numbers of tissue and blood
samples from patients before initiation of immunotherapy
and subject such samples to genomics (whole exome
sequencing and RNA sequencing), multiplex IHC, flow
cytometry, and proteomics analyses, with the results
coupled to clinical outcomes. These studies will aid in the
characterization of predictors of response and progres-
sion. On the basis of these signatures, clinical trials should
be performed to test combinations that have been shown
to overcome the specific defect in the cancer-immune
interaction present in that particular patient population.
Another approach is to treat in earlier disease stages
with the aim of increasing cure rates. Early results from
melanoma studies suggest that the general immune state
of stage III disease patients is better than that of stage IV
patients, resulting in a higher RR and more toxicities.226
Interestingly,
pathologic
responses
have
also
been
observed after neoadjuvant anti–PD-1 in early NSCLC.227
Earlier-stage patients may require a shorter treatment
duration than stage IV patients. Immunotherapy is being
actively studied in the neoadjuvant (NCT02259621/
NCT02998528)
and
the
adjuvant
(NCT02504372/
NCT02273375) settings in NSCLC.
Finally, as pricing of new immuno-oncology drugs is
unlikely to change soon, the aforementioned future
directions will certainly lead to a much more cost-
effective utilization of our resources, as chances for
best outcome will be optimal.
SCLC
Section Authors: Corinne Faivre-Finn, MD, PhD,

RT for SCLC. The optimal timing and schedule of thoracic
radiation in the management of limited-stage (LS) SCLC
continues to provoke debate. Since the publication of
Intergroup 0096 in 1999, there has been controversy
about the standard chemoradiotherapy regimen in LS
disease.228,229 At the American Society of Clinical Oncology
2016 annual meeting, the CONVERT trial was pre-
sented.230 This multicenter, international, randomized,
phase III trial aimed to establish a standard chemo-
radiotherapy regimen in LS SCLC. Patients were random-
ized 1:1 to receive either 45 Gy in 30 twice-daily fractions
over 3 weeks or 66 Gy in 33 once-daily fractions over 6.5
weeks starting on day 22 of cycle 1 of chemotherapy,
followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation. The study
enrolled 547 patients, who were recruited from 73 centers
in seven European countries and Canada between 2008
and 2013. Once-daily RT did not result in superior survival
or worse toxicity than twice-daily RT (2-year survival of
56% compared with 51% [HR for death in the once-daily
group ¼ 1.18, p ¼ 0.14]). The survival for both regimens
was higher than previously reported and radiation toxic-
ities were lower than expected, likely because of the use of
modern RT techniques. The implications of CONVERT are
important. As CONVERT was not an equivalence trial and
because the only study to date that has shown superiority
for one RT regimen over another in LS SCLC is the Inter-
group 0096 trial (which showed no major differences in
toxicity), twice-daily RT should continue to be regarded as
the standard of care. However, once-daily RT at a dose of
66 Gy in 33 fractions can certainly be considered an
alternative regimen if 45 Gy in 30 fractions twice daily
cannot be delivered because of patient choice, depart-
mental logistics, or other factors. Given the importance of
keeping the overall treatment time short, future studies
could investigate dose-escalated twice-daily or hypo-
fractionated RT concurrently with chemotherapy.
For patients with extensive-stage SCLC with residual
intrathoracic disease who have responded after induc-
tion chemotherapy, addition of thoracic RT reduces the
risk for intrathoracic recurrence and improves 2-year
survival231; however, the primary end point of 1-year
survival was not met. A survey of routine practice pre-
sented at the European Society for Radiotherapy and
Oncology 2016 conference showed that since publication
of the CREST trial there has been a dramatic increase in
the use of TRT (from 25% to 81%).232 Subsequently, a
subanalysis
of
CREST
investigating
the
prognostic
importance of the number and sites of metastases was
presented at the ASTRO 2016 annual meeting.233 It
suggested that future studies evaluating more intensive
thoracic and extrathoracic RT in extensive-stage SCLC
focus on patients with fewer than three metastases that
are not in the liver or bone.
AdvancesinNovel SystemicTherapies for SCLC. Several
new approaches to systemic treatment of SCLC have
recently emerged and have been the subject of recent

 reviews.234,235 These will be touched on here only briefly,
but
they
include
combination
immunotherapy
ap-
proaches that have shown substantial efficacy in other
diseases, as well as a novel antibody drug conjugate
against a cell surface determinant, DLL3, which is rela-
tively unique to SCLC.
In the immunotherapy domain, several of the same
PD-1–directed T-cell checkpoint inhibitors already dis-
cussed in relation to NSCLC, including both pem-
brolizumab and nivolumab, have demonstrated initial
activity in SCLC.236,237 Early data with the combination
of
nivolumab
plus
ipilimumab
appear
particularly
promising. In a 216-patient randomized phase II study of
nivolumab versus various schedules of nivolumab and
ipilimumab, the combination arms demonstrated RRs of
19% to 23% and DCRs of 36% to 42%.236 The toxicities
observed were similar to those reported in other dis-
eases. On the basis of these data, the combination of
nivolumab and ipilimumab has been included as a
treatment option for recurrent SCLC in the most recent
National Comprehensive Cancer Network treatment
guidelines for SCLC, and confirmatory trials are ongoing.
DLL3 is an inhibitory Notch ligand that is normally
confined to intracellular compartments but is markedly
up-regulated and becomes aberrantly cell surface–
expressed in most SCLC.238 Rovalpituzumab teserine, or
Rova-T, is an antibody drug conjugate directed against
DLL3 that demonstrated remarkable preclinical efficacy
against SCLC in vivo238 and promising activity in a first-
in-human phase I clinical trial in patients with recurrent
metastatic SCLC.239 Early data suggest that high-level
expression of the target, DLL3, may serve as a predic-
tive biomarker for the activity of this agent, as a 38% RR
(10 of 26) and DCR of 88% (23 of 26) were observed in
two-thirds of patients with DLL3 expressed in more than
50% of the cells. Larger confirmatory trials of Rova-T in
SCLC are ongoing.
Mesothelioma
Section Authors: Anne Tsao, MD, Paul Baas, MD, PhD
In the past year, the field of mesothelioma treatment
has seen a dramatic increase in therapeutic clinical trials.
Several basket trials in immunotherapy with mesotheli-
oma cohorts have reported on the preliminary results of
monotherapy PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (Table 4).240–243 In
general, the reported RRs vary between 9% and 28%,
with DCRs of 50% to 77% in unselected patients with
mesothelioma. As in NSCLC, checkpoint inhibitors seem
to be more active in PD-L1 IHC–positive patients, but the
association is not strong. Unfortunately, the cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte
associated
protein
inhibitor
trem-
elimumab did not show any benefit over placebo in the
DETERMINE trial (NCT01843374).244 Although there is
a preliminary modest signal with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors,
there is still a critical need to understand the biology
and develop novel combination therapies. Combination
regimens such as ipilimumab-nivolumab and platinum-
pemetrexed combinations with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors
are being investigated in the frontline and salvage
settings (Table 5). Other approaches encompass neo-
adjuvant trials with atezolizumab or adjuvant trials with
a Wilms’ tumor 1 vaccine, galinpepimut-S.245
In the field of angiogenesis, the French MAPS trial246
demonstrated a PFS and OS benefit with the addition of
bevacizumab to cisplatin-pemetrexed for six cycles of
therapy
followed
by
bevacizumab
maintenance.
On the basis of survival benefit, cisplatin-pemetrexed-
bevacizumab is now listed in the National Comprehen-
sive Cancer Network guidelines as an approved frontline
therapy. On the basis of a significant improvement of
PFS, nintedanib combined with cisplatin-pemetrexed has
proceeded to a phase III international randomized trial
(NCT01907100). In Europe the EORTC is currently
studying nintedanib in a phase 2 switch maintenance
setting (NCT02863055). The phase II study of cisplatin-
pemetrexed with or without cediranib (S0905 trial) has
completed
enrollment
and
results
are
anticipated
in 2017.
Agents that inhibit metabolism or other novel targets
under active investigation include ADI-PEG20 in argini-
nosuccinate synthase 1–deficient mesothelioma (the
ATOMIC trial and NCT02709512), mesothelin-targeted
agents (SS1P, anetumab ravtasine, and LMB-100), taze-

Quality and Value in Lung Cancer
Section

Natasha
Leighl,
MD,
MMSc,
Ronan J. Kelly, MD, MBA
Quality and value are emerging as key priorities in
cancer care. Value in cancer, the relationship between
treatment benefit and cost, remains a challenging subject
worldwide. Regulatory agencies such as the U.S. FDA and
European Medicines Agency focus on efficacy and safety
of novel interventions, approving new treatments that
yield statistically better outcomes. Other bodies such as
the National Institute for Health Care Excellence (United
Kingdom) and pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review
focus on value, including cost and clinical relevance of
these improved outcomes. By contrast, the U.S. Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services does not consider
cost
when
making
treatment-funding
decisions.
Furthermore, the Affordable Care Act forbids the use of
cost-effectiveness thresholds at the Patient Centered
Outcomes Research Institute when making funding
recommendations.
However, there is growing recognition that value in
cancer care is important to patients and clinicians.
Several international bodies, including the American
Society of Clinical Oncology and European Society for
Medical Oncology, have developed standardized value
frameworks to help determine the value of treatments,
incorporating the magnitude of clinical benefit, toxicity,
and QOL gain without aggregating these measures as a
formal cost-effectiveness analysis.247–249 For example,
the European Society for Medical Oncology Magnitude of
Clinical Benefit Scale uses a structured approach to rank
treatments by using a four-point scale based on relative
and absolute survival gain, toxicity rates, QOL, and use of
intermediate end points such as PFS.247
With a record number of drug approvals, meaningful
progress is being made in the areas of targeted and
immune
therapy
in
lung
cancer.
Cost-effectiveness
studies suggest that the costs of many new treatments,
including multiplex genomic testing,250 novel targeted
kinase inhibitors251 and checkpoint inhibitors, are above
traditional willingness-to-pay thresholds.252–254 Each
jurisdiction must determine its own willingness to pay
for new treatments, which varies across countries and
health care systems. Given that severe financial toxicity
is recognized as a potential predictor of early mortality
in lung and other cancers,255 implementing strategies to
ensure affordable access to treatment has never been
more important for patients with lung cancer and their
families.
Specific Future Perspectives
Section Authors: Fred R. Hirsch, MD, PhD, Giorgio
V. Scagliotti, MD, PhD, David R. Gandara, MD
The past year led to significant progress for new lung
cancer therapies based on genomic characterization of
patients’ tumors and further clinical developments of
immunotherapies.
The growing concept of precision medicine addresses
this challenge by recognizing the vast, yet fractured state
of biomedical data and calls for a patient-centered view
in which molecular, clinical, and environmental mea-
surements are stored in large shareable databases. Such
efforts have already enabled large-scale knowledge
advancement, but they also risk enabling large-scale
misuse.
There is still a huge unmet need for identifying new
“druggable” molecular targets, particularly in squa-
mous lung cancer and SCLC. Furthermore, much focus
has so far been on single-drug development, which
has been very encouraging for certain subgroups of
patients; in the vast majority of patients, however,
combination therapy may be required to convert
treatment intent to the “curable” category. Despite the
early
successes
of
targeted
therapies,
it
is
also
becoming evident that primary and acquired resistance
are major limitations to long-term survival. Most lung
cancers will not be cured by single-agent targeted
therapies owing to the inherent genomic complexity,
which is now complicated by recognition of heteroge-
neity in immune biology as well.
Clearly, there is much yet to understand about in vivo
tumor biology, and exploring resistance mechanisms is
essential to determining which combination of drugs will
best treat resistant tumors or prevent the emergence of
resistance.
Although pharmaceutical companies are still pursu-
ing many phase II or III combination studies that assess
molecular targeted therapies or immunotherapy in
combination with chemotherapy, or in combination with
each other, study designs remain largely empirical and
often without sufficient biological scientific background
or rationale for dosing/scheduling for the combinations.
Selection of the right therapy for the right patient is
crucial, as the new treatments are costly; but most of all,
patients with advanced lung cancer have a limited life
span and optimizing therapy on an individual basis
should be the goal. This is, after all, the definition of
precision medicine.

 Improved understanding of the cancer immune
landscape, including immune evasion strategies, has led
to breakthrough therapeutic advances for patients with
NSCLC and provides a platform for future therapeutic
developments. Better preclinical models need to be
developed to study tumor-environment interactions and
potential intervention opportunities. Although PD-L1
IHC assessment is used today for PD-L1 and/or PD-1
antibody therapies with some merit (biomarker assays
already regulatory approved and used in clinical prac-
tice), other biomarkers and synergistic combinatorial
biomarker assays need to be explored as predictive
“immune signatures.”
Several scientific societies and regulatory bodies
are concerned about the cost of newer therapies and
quantitation
of
the
“value”
of
each
new
therapy.
Although cost-benefit analysis is increasingly justified,
such algorithms are preferably developed by the scien-
tific community rather than dictated by governmental or
insurance-based policies.
Lung
cancer
screening
with
low-dose
CT
has
demonstrated very encouraging results. However, much
research is still needed, particularly as guidelines and
new technology develop. Screening opportunities for
never-smokers and younger people also need to be
explored. It remains crucial to foster future research in
lung cancer prevention, early detection, and screening.
Although most of the excitement regarding new thera-
pies today focuses on patients with advanced disease,
the odds for making lung cancer a curable disease are
favored by moving these advances toward early-stage
disease. New biomarkers, most likely blood-based as-
says, to complement the lung cancer screening process
are strongly needed to improve the sensitivity and
specificity of low-dose CT screening.
Regarding
other
thoracic
malignancies
such
as
mesothelioma and thymoma, lessons learned in lung
cancer are now increasingly being applied toward
advancing our knowledge about biology, epidemiology,
diagnosis, and therapy. Although the future for patients
with lung cancer and research appears to be bright,
much work remains to be done.
