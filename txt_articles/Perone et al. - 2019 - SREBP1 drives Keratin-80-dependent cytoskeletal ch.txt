Approximately 30% of ERα breast cancer patients relapse with metastatic disease following
adjuvant endocrine therapies. The connection between acquisition of drug resistance and
invasive potential is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that the type II keratin
topological associating domain undergoes epigenetic reprogramming in aromatase inhibitors
(AI)-resistant cells, leading to Keratin-80 (KRT80) upregulation. KRT80 expression is driven
by de novo enhancer activation by sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1).
KRT80 upregulation directly promotes cytoskeletal rearrangements at the leading edge,
increased focal adhesion and cellular stiffening, collectively promoting cancer cell invasion.
Shearwave elasticity imaging performed on prospectively recruited patients confirms KRT80
levels correlate with stiffer tumors. Immunohistochemistry showed increased KRT80-positive
cells at relapse and, using several clinical endpoints, KRT80 expression associates with poor
survival. Collectively, our data uncover an unpredicted and potentially targetable direct link
between epigenetic and cytoskeletal reprogramming promoting cell invasion in response
to chronic AI treatment.

 A
romatase inhibitors (AI) treatment is standard of care for
breast cancer (BC), yet BC cells frequently display drug-
resistance and stronger metastatic potential at relapse,
suggesting that chronic exposure to endocrine treatment might
contribute in shaping the invasive potential, as suggested by
previous in vitro studies1,2. The mechanism/s, order of events
and molecular players mediating these phenomena are not well
understood but it is likely that they involve cytoskeletal re-
arrangements as they are essential for cancer invasion and
metastasis3. One possibility is that endocrine therapies (ET)
might indirectly promote invasive behaviors by selecting for
interrelated phenotypes during tumor evolution4–6. Alternatively,
AI treatment may directly contribute to the activation of
invasive transcriptional programs. Chronic exposure to ET leads
to coordinated activation and decommissioning of regulatory
regions such as enhancer and promoters as shown by global
changes in the localization of epigenetic marks H3K27ac and
H3K4me1-26,7,8. These epigenetic changes occasionally involve
entire
topological
associating
domains
(TADs),
three-
dimensional compartments within the genome thought to
restrict enhancer-promoter interactions9,10. In this manuscript,
we show how drug-induced epigenetic reprogramming leads to
significant cytoskeletal changes and mechano-properties at the
cellular level to promote invasive behavior.
Results
Epigenetic reprogramming leads to KRT80 expression in drug-
resistant BC. We have previously shown that the type II keratin
TAD7
ranked
among
the
most
significantly
epigenetically
reprogrammed TADs when comparing untreated (MCF7, ERα-
positive breast cancer cell lines) non-invasive ET-treated (MCF7
cells resistant to Tamoxifen: MCF7T or Fulvestrant: MCF7F) vs.
invasive AI-resistant BC cell lines7 (MCF7 that were long term
estrogen deprived: LTED cells, and double resistant LTEDT and
LTEDF Fig. 1a, b). ChIP-seq efficiencies were rather different
across each cell line but, genome-wide normalization confirmed
that overall, the type II keratin TAD accrues significantly more
H3K27ac reads in invasive LTED cells compared with MCF7 and
MCF7T cells (Top 5% for differential9, Fig. 1a inset). Targeted
validation within one of the potential enhancers (E1) using
H3K27ac, H3K4me2, and H3K4me1 confirmed the significant
increase of H3K27ac between MCF7 and LTED (Fig. 1c). Type I
and Type II Keratins are the main constituents of cytoplasmic
intermediate filaments and are involved in crucial cellular pro-
cesses including cell attachment, stress adaptation, and cell
structure maintenance; yet very little is known about their role in
cell
movement
and
metastatic
progression.
Despite
TAD
dynamics, only few keratins within the type II-keratin TAD were
transcriptionally reprogrammed in AI-resistant cell lines, with
KRT80 being the only member which was consistently upregu-
lated in all LTED models, including LTED-derivatives from a
different breast cancer cell line (T47D, Fig. 1a, b and Supple-
mentary Fig. 1a, b). Live-tracking cells during the initial 48 h of
estrogen deprivation shows the absence of substantial prolifera-
tion and/or cell death, suggesting that the majority of cells simply
stall within this time frame (Fig. 1d, flat orange line from 6 to 48
h). Measuring KRT80 transcripts before or after short-term (48 h)
acute estrogen starvation using single cell RNA-seq data shows a
significant increase in the proportion of KRT80 positive cells,
strongly suggesting that this increase is driven by de novo tran-
scriptional activation and not selection of KRT80-positive clones
(Fig. 1e). These data were validated in MCF7 and LTED cells
using single cell RNA-FISH (Fig. 1f). As expected, increased
transcription corresponded to increased KRT80 protein level in
both MCF7 and T47D models (Fig. 1g). Interestingly, LTED
cells also show significant changes in H3K27ac levels and mRNA
expression for cholesterol biosynthesis genes7, but unexpectedly
the master regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis SREBP111 shows
no transcriptional changes between the two cell types, suggesting
that reprogramming is not driven by transcriptional factor
abundance but rather by its activity7 (Fig. 1f).
KRT80 dynamically changes during breast cancer progression
in vivo. KRT80 is a largely unknown keratin structurally related
to hair keratins12, in contrast with epithelial keratins commonly
found in normal epithelial cells. This led us to further explore the
role of KRT80 in promoting the invasive phenotype developed by
LTED as a consequence of AI-resistance7. KRT80 transcripts
were also elevated in several ERα-negative cell lines, suggesting
that upregulation in drug-resistant cells was not mediated by
changes in ERα activity (Supplementary Data 1). More impor-
tantly, IHC analysis of two independent clinical datasets con-
firmed that KRT80 positive cells significantly increase after AI
treatment while showing a trend in Tamoxifen-treated patients
in vivo13,14 (Fig. 2a). KRT80 localization in vivo was radically
different to what has been shown in conventional keratins (e.g.,
KRT8, KRT14, KRT18, or KRT1915), presenting a peri-nuclear
polarized pattern towards the lumen within healthy ducts and
lobules (Fig. 2b). Similar staining patterns were conserved in
benign lesions (Fig. 2b), whereas KRT80 staining became strongly
cytoplasmic in higher grade BC and metastatic lesions suggesting
a potential role in BC progression (Fig. 2b). Correspondingly,
high KRT80 mRNA levels correlated with poor survival in the
METABRIC ERα-positive BC dataset (Fig. 2c), even more sig-
nificantly when selecting patients that did relapse early and were
treated with endocrine therapies (Fig. 2c). The prognostic role of
KRT80 was then confirmed by multivariate meta-analysis of two
independent datasets with several additional clinical endpoints
(Supplementary Fig. 1c–e and Supplementary Fig. 2). Interest-
ingly, KRT80 was the only reprogrammed Type-II keratin sig-
nificantly associated with clinical endpoints in BC patients
(Fig. 2d).
De novo SREBP1 drives KRT80 activation. Activation of cell
type specific enhancers has been linked with cancer transcrip-
tional aberration6,16–18, leading us to hypothesize that de novo
enhancer activation within the TAD structure might control
KRT80 expression in AI resistant cells. We used H3K27ac, an
epigenetic mark associated with gene activation6,19, to narrow
down the potential KRT80 enhancers (E1 and E2, Fig. 1b). As
expected, E1-E2 activity was only captured in KRT80-positive
cells (Fig. 1b) while E1 enhancer activity analysis predicted a
significant increase in KRT80 positive cells in AI resistant models
(Fig. 1c), in agreement with mRNA and protein analysis (Fig. 1a,
f, g and Supplementary Fig. 3a). 3D meta-analysis from parental
MCF7 ChIA-Pet data strongly suggested that the E1 loci could
contact the KRT80 promoter via enhancer-promoter interactions,
while it excluded the weaker E2 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) sug-
gesting that the 3D interaction is already pre-established in sen-
sitive cells. To test whether E1 drove KRT80 transcriptional
activity in other context, we adapted our recently developed
computational pipeline to measure the relative size of KRT80-
positive clones in several tissues6. This pipeline can estimate the
percentage of cells containing an active enhancer, as at individual
loci the epigenetic signal is a function of the number of mod-
ified nucleosomes6. We thus tested if the estimated size of KRT80
positive cells based on E1 activity in each model is reflected at
the transcriptional level. Analysis of Epigenetic Roadmap data
with associated transcriptional profiles20 strongly suggested that
increasing E1 positivity, predicting for increasing content of

(Fig. 3a). E1 activity was also potentially associated with KRT80
transcription in several cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). For
example, Keratinocytes ranked as the most clonal KRT80 cell type
and exhibited the highest KRT80 mRNA levels (Supplementary
Fig. 3c, d). Colon cancer HCT116 cells also were predicted to
contain a clonal KRT80 cell population based on E1 activity
(Supplementary Fig. 3c, d). On the other hand, E1 predicts only
for a small subpopulation within normal cells from the large
intestine (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, KRT80 is dramatically upregu-
lated during intestine oncogenesis21 (ranked 4th overall as the
most significantly upregulated gene in TCGA normal vs. cecum

 cancer) strongly suggesting a progressive activation of E1 during
colon cancer transformation. E1 also predicts for clonal KRT80
expression in HUVEC cells and HUVEC cells are characterized
by strong KRT80 transcription (Supplementary Fig. 3c, d).
Finally, KRT80 E1 activity also correctly predicted strong
expression in mammary epithelium cells (Supplementary Fig. 3c,
d). Conversely, samples with no E1 activity were found to have no
KRT80 transcription (i.e., immune cells and iPS cells). Overall
these data strongly link E1 to KRT80 transcription. As E1
enhancers span nearly 12.5 Kb, we performed fine-mapping
analysis to narrow down on potential readers. Using our com-
putational pipeline, we sought for E1 sub-regions more strongly
associated with KRT80 expression in our BC cell lines leading to
the identification of a core-region within the E1 enhancer (1.5
Kb) (Supplementary Fig. 3a). This core enhancer showed a clear
pattern of activity in actual BC patients6 predicting the existence
of KRT80 clonal and sub-clonal populations in primary and
metastatic BC (Fig. 3b). We next investigated which transcription
factor/s (TFs) might regulate KRT80 expression via core-E1
binding. DHS-seq analysis7 indicated that KRT80 is already
accessible in MCF7 (Fig. 3c), yet digital foot-printing suggested
different occupancy sites (Fig. 3d). Intriguingly, among other
footprints, we noted the appearance of a SREBP1 footprint within
the core-E1 unique to LTED cells. We have previously reported
that AI resistant cells upregulate lipid biosynthesis via global
epigenetic reprogramming7 suggesting widespread SREBP1 acti-
vation in AI resistant cells. However, SREBP1 is not differentially
expressed in LTED cells when compared with parental MCF7
cells (Fig. 1f), suggesting that SREBP1 might upregulate its targets
by increased nuclear shuttling and chromatin binding. This led to
the hypothesis that increased SREBP1 occupancy might drive
KRT80 transcriptional activation in LTED cells. ENCODE TFs
mapping showed that SREBP1 can bind the core-E1 enhancers in
lung cancer cells, the only ENCODE profiled cells characterized
by strong KRT80 transcription (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). To
directly test if SREBP1 drives KRT80 expression in BC we per-
formed ChIP-seq in MCF7 and T47D cells and their respective
AI-resistant models. Our data demonstrate that SREBP1 was
bound at core-E1 only in AI-resistant BC cells (Fig. 3e and
Supplementary Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the expression of KRT80
and SREBP1 target genes was also strongly correlated in BC
patients
(Supplementary
Fig.
4d).
Finally,
we
show
that
SREBP1 silencing abrogated KRT80 expression in LTED cells
(Fig. 3f, g). Overall these data demonstrate an unpredicted link
between SREBP1 and KRT80 activation. Phastcons, PhyloP and
Siphy rates, which measure the rate of DNA conservation
between different species, show a significant drop in conservation
at the SREBP1 footprint within the otherwise conserved E1
enhancer (Supplementary Fig. 5), suggesting that the link between
SREBP1 and KRT80 might have evolved relatively recently.
Overall, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the core-
E1 is the critical enhancer driving KRT80 expression in BC cells.
KRT80 directly promotes increased tumor stiffness in vitro
and in vivo. Several studies have investigated how mechanical
stimuli influence the epigenetic landscape22,23. However, our data
implied a novel causal link whereby epigenetic reprogramming
promoted changes in specific cytoskeletal components (e.g.,
KRT80) which may ultimately affect the biophysical properties of
cells and tumors24,25 (Figs. 1–3). In agreement, we observed a
significant increase in cellular stiffness (inversely correlated to cell
compliance/deformability) at the single cell level after KRT80
over-expression in MCF7 and LTED cells (Fig. 4a). Conversely,
KRT80 depletion in LTED cells resulted in a significant loss of
cellular stiffness (Fig. 4a). To test if KRT80 can contribute to
tumor stiffness in vivo we prospectively recruited 20 patients with
suspected BC and performed shear-wave elastography to measure
intra-tumoral stiffness. Elastography was performed prior to
biopsies were taken but all cases were subsequently confirmed
positive breast cancer (Fig. 4b). Our data showed that cancer
lesions had significantly higher stiffness than surrounding normal
tissues, with the highest peak of stiffness consistently measured at
the invasive border (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, meta-analysis of
tumor and matched nearby tissue from TCGA show increased
KRT80 mRNA in the tumor biopsies (Supplementary Fig. 6). We
then performed IHC for KRT80 with validated antibodies (Fig. 4c
and Supplementary Fig. 7) using biopsies collected from our
prospective patients. Linear regression analysis showed that
KRT80 positivity significantly correlated with intra-tumor stiff-
ness (Fig. 4d). Collectively, these data demonstrate that BCs
characterized with high KRT80 content are mechanically stiffer.
KRT80 upregulation leads to augmented collective invasion.
The effect of increasing stiffness in metastatic invasion is highly
debated. Previous studies have suggested that decreased stiffness,
through loss of keratins, improves single-cell invasion24 typical of
EMT cells. However, solid tumors can also use a myriad of
multicellular invasion programs26 collectively termed “collective
invasion”. Recent studies have shown that keratins such as
KRT14 can play critical roles in collective invasion27 and multi-
clonal metastatic seeding27,28, two processes driving BC pro-
gression27. In addition, a significant body of clinical literature has
linked increased breast tumor stiffness to poorer prognosis27,29–31

 and lymph node positivity27,29,30, independently of changes in
extracellular matrix stiffness. We reasoned that a model in which
KRT80 upregulation in BC cells leads to increased stiffness and
augmented collective invasion might reconcile all these observa-
tions. To test this, we developed 3D spheroids from MCF7 or
LTED cells and assessed collective invasion (Fig. 5a) after KRT80
manipulation
(Supplementary

from
KRT80-positive LTED cells could effectively invade intro matrigel

abrogated the invasive phenotype (Fig. 5c, d and Supplementary

matrix invading capacities in otherwise non-invasive MCF7 cells,
even in the absence of chronic estrogen deprivation (Fig. 5b, d).

Fig. 3 De novo SREBP1 binding at KRT80 enhancer drives KRT80. a Predicted KRT80 enhancer clonality (x-axis) and KRT80 RNA levels (y-axis) are plotted
for three independent transcriptional datasets (fantom5; HPA, Human Protein Atlas, GTEx, Genotype-Tissue Expression). Epigenetic data were obtained
from the ENCODE consortia. Increasing KRT80 enhancer clonality is associated with an increasing number of KRT80 positive cells (symbols at the top, see
methods for more details). b Enhancer clonality from H3K27ac data obtained in primary and metastatic breast cancer biopsies. Green dotted line indicates
the presence of clonal KRT80-positive lesions. Orange dotted lines predict for KRT80-low lesions. Each circle represents an individual patient. KRT80
clonality was calculated using the core 1.5Kb H3K27ac peak. c Open chromatin profiling via DHS-seq in MCF7 and LTED cells near the KRT80 locus.

 clustered at the invasive front in LTED spheroids (Fig. 5e and
Supplementary Fig. 9a, b), a pattern reminiscent of the leading
cells
characterized
in
epithelial
tumors
during
collective
invasion27,28. To confirm that invasion was driven by active
motion rather than proliferation at the border of the organoids,
we repeated invasion assays using proliferation sensitive live-
labeling (Fig. 5f). Labeled cells maintained their invasive prop-
erties while KRT80 suppression still blocked invasion (Fig. 5g). As
expected, invading cells retained the dye suggesting that they
actively moved into the matrigel interface in absence of cell
division (Fig. 5h). These data are supported by live-imaging of
organoid invasion performed previously in the same cell lines7.
KRT80 reorganizes cells cytoskeleton to promote lamellipodia
formation. Confocal microscopy analyses informed that LTED
and MCF7-KRT80 cells presented an intricate network of KRT80
filaments that significantly overlap actin fibers (Fig. 6a, b). This
KRT80 network was prominent at the leading edge of cells,
usually localized at or annexed to actin-rich lamellipodium-like
structures (Fig. 6b, asterisk). Conversely, in KRT80low cells (i.e.,
MCF7 and LTED-shA), KRT80 staining was more punctuated
and mainly observed towards the cell cortex, with border cells
presenting strong cortical actin (Fig. 6b, hashtag) and no pro-
minent lamellipodia32. Quantitative analysis of confocal data
showed that KRT80 expression was associated with a significant
increase of F-actin at lamellipodial structures, with smaller
compensating changes at the cell cortex and cytosol depending on
the system (i.e., MCF or LTED) (Fig. 6c, d). Importantly, no
significant changes were observed in the total F-actin between
MCF7/MCF-KRT80 or LTED/LTED-shKRT80 (Fig. 6d). Toge-
ther, these results suggest that the generation of a network of
KRT80 positive filaments do not affect actin polymerization but
rather reorganize the actin cytoskeleton to promote lamellipodia
formation. In agreement, cells expressing KRT80 presented a
higher proportion of cells with lamellipodia when compared with
their KRT80low counterparts (Fig. 6e). Focal adhesion growth and
maturation are tightly coupled with the forward movement of the
lamellipodium33,
are
associated
to
cell
stiffness/cellular
tension29,30, and are particularly relevant in the generation of
forces required for migration and invasion in complex settings. In
line with KRT80 playing a role in these processes, we observed
that KRT80 directly promoted the generation of larger more
mature paxillin focal adhesions, with no significant change in the

Fig. 4 KRT80 levels are associated with changes in cell stiffness. a Magnetic tweezers (yellow) were used to measure the biomechanical properties of
individual cells with or without KRT80 manipulation. Changes in cell compliance (deformation) were measured in KRT80 over-expressing cells for both
parental MCF7 and AI-resistant LTED cells (left and middle graphs). Changes in cell compliance (deformation) were measured after stable KRT80
depletion in LTED cells (right graph). Significance was calculated with a student t- test and reported. b Shearwave Ultrasound measurements in
prospectively recruited patients. Measures were collected at three independent location for each patient (see diagram). Plots show matched tissue
stiffness for cancer vs. normal (large panel) and peri-tumoral interface vs. cancer (small inset). c KRT80 cells in diagnostic material from prospective
patients assessed with ultrasound were counted using IHC. d Plots show matched tissue stiffness against the percentage of KRT80-positive cells for each
individual patient. Simple linear regression was applied to calculate the correlation coefficient between these two values

positivity strongly characterized invading cells from prospectively

tary Fig. 9c)33,34.
KRT80 drives cytoskeletal changes involved in migration and
invasion. To test if KRT80 manipulation drives ancillary
phenotypes synergistic to cytoskeletal changes, we performed
RNA-seq in cells transfected with KRT80 but where SREBP1 is
not yet activated (non-invasive MCF7 cells, Fig. 7a). Ectopic
KRT80 expression led to clear transcriptional differences domi-
nated by the reprogramming of a small set of genes (Fig. 7a, b and

 Supplementary Data 2). Amongst them, we found particularly
striking the strong KRT80-dependent induction of cortactin
(CTTN), a factor directly linked to actin rearrangements, lamel-
lipodia formation and cancer cell invasion34,35, that we confirmed
by immunofluorescence (Fig. 7d). In addition, we also detected a
significant upregulation of SEPT9, a member of the septin family
directly linked to actin fiber formation, focal adhesion matura-
tion, and motility36,37 (Fig. 7b). Genes activated in response to
KRT80 upregulation have prognostic value, even when other
classical clinical features are considered (Fig. 7e). These data
parallel KRT80 prognostic features and hint that these genes
might underlie early metastatic invasion (Fig. 7e). We also
observed that several genes negatively regulated by KRT80
induction play central roles in cancer biology including negative
regulators of migration (PCDH10, CADM1), tumor suppressors
such as CDKN1A and PDCD2, genes involved in DNA repair
(RAD50), chromatin remodelers as SMARCE1 and CHD4 and
tumor specific antigens (CD276) suggesting a direct link between
cytoskeletal reprogramming and several other oncogenic pheno-
types (Fig. 7b). Together, these results further support that
KRT80 manipulation is sufficient to activate genes driving dra-
matic cytoskeletal rearrangements that ultimately induce invasive
behaviors in BC and poorer prognosis. We cannot speculate at
the moment if this is driven by a cytoskeleton-transcriptional
feedback or it is mediated by some specific transcriptional factors.
Discussion
The relationship between drug-resistance and phenotypic repro-
gramming in breast cancer has not been studied in detail, as
generally the focus has been on characterizing the mechanisms of
resistance rather than the associated changes in traits that might
possibly play a role in shifting cancer cell behaviors. Furthermore,
it is known that aberrant cytoskeletal architecture characterizes
tumor cells and it is associated with cell migration and invasion;
yet the endogenous and exogenous triggers underlying cytoske-
letal reorganization in tumor cells are not well understood. Here,
we have uncovered a novel and causal link between endocrine
therapy resistance, intra-tumoral stiffness and augmented inva-
sive potential in luminal BC (Fig. 7f). Our data strongly suggest
that therapy plays a direct role in shaping the biophysical prop-
erties and invasive potential of cancer cells, by inducing epige-
netic
rearrangements
leading
to
KRT80
upregulation
and
concomitant cytoskeletal reorganization. Our data strongly sug-
gest that SREBP1 is the link between drug-resistance and cytos-
keletal reprogramming. Upon long-term AI treatment, SREBP1
mediates the activation of pro-survival pathways7 by promoting
the cell-autonomous production of endogenous ERα ligands. In
addition, SREBP1 is also recruited at the KRT80 enhancer, a non-
canonical SREBP1 target, leading to KRT80 transcription in drug-
treated cells. This mechanism does not appear to be promoted by
absolute changes in SREBP1 abundance, but rather by enhanced
chromatin binding. Furthermore, it is important to note that our
data demonstrate that SREBP1 is essential but might not be
sufficient for KRT80 activation. How SREBP1 is capable to sense
AI-mediated stress needs to be worked out mechanistically, but
overall these data support SREBP1 as a potential target to
antagonize BC progression. We also describe an unexpected role
for intermediate filaments in promoting cancer cell invasion by
showing for the first time that KRT80 promotes actin cytoske-
leton rearrangements. These are characterized primarily by the
formation of lamellipodia and mature focal adhesions, which are
critical structures required for migration in complex environ-
ments33. Our data might also reconcile some previous observa-
tions that were in an apparent contrast. Few clinical studies have
highlighted that stiffer BC lesions do carry worse prognosis27,29–31,
while others suggested that EMT-like processes, necessarily
decrease intracellular stiffness, are needed for tumor progression.
The link between treatment, KRT80 activation and increased
stiffness would fit with several of these observations, especially in
the light of collective-invasion phenotypes observed for ERα-
positive BC cells27,28. Larger longitudinal clinical studies mea-
suring stiffness and KRT80 activation in endocrine neoadjuvant-
treated patients are needed and should be linked to long-term
monitoring for distal relapse.
A directional link between epigenetic and cytoskeleton repro-
gramming was not described before and it offers an intriguing
axis for drug development and biomarker discovery, especially
within the goal of preventing metastatic invasion in BC patients
treated with aromatase inhibitors.
Methods
Cell lines and cell culture. All cell lines used in the study were karyotyped and
validated and no cell lines from the ICLAC database were used. In this study we
used MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cell line and derived resistant clones (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1). MCF7 Tamoxifen Resistant cell line (MCF7T) was derived from
MCF7 upon one-year treatment with Tamoxifen. MCF7 Fulvestrant Resistant cell
line (MCF7F) was derived from MCF7 upon one-year treatment with Fulvestrant.
LTED (Long Term Estrogen Deprivation) cell lines were derived from MCF7 cell
line upon one-year estrogen deprivation, mimicking aromatase inhibitor resistance.
LTED Tamoxifen Resistant cells (LTEDT) were derived from LTEDs upon one-
year Tamoxifen treatment. LTED Fulvestrant Resistant cells (LTEDF) were derived
from LTEDs upon one-year Fulvestrant treatment38,39. In addition, we employed
an alternative aromatase inhibitor resistant model: T47D breast adenocarcinoma
cell line and T47D-LTED. The latter was derived from T47D parental upon six
months of estrogen deprivation. MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines were
cultured in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FCS (Fetal Calf
Serum, First Link UK), 2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/
mL streptomycin (Sigma). MCF7 were further supplemented with 10-8 M Estradiol
(Sigma). Estrogen-deprived cell lines (LTED, LTEDT, and T47D-LTED) were
cultured in phenol-red free DMEM (Gibco, Life Technologies) supplemented with
10% DC-FCS (Double Charcoal stripped Fetal Calf Serum, First Link UK) and 2
mM L-Glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma-
Aldrich). LTEDT were further supplemented with 10–7 M Tamoxifen (SIGMA).
All cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination using MycoAlert mycoplasma
detection kit Assay Control Set by Lonza (LT07-518) following manufacturer’s
instructions.

 Generation of stable cell lines. For KRT80 overexpression, a full length KRT80
cDNA clone Myc-DKK-tagged was obtained from OriGene and transformed into
DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was isolated using Maxi-Prep
Kit (QIAGEN) and transfected in MCF7 and LTED cells using X-tremeGENE 9
DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Transfected cells, carrying Neomycin resistance, were selected with G418 (SIGMA),
used at a final concentration of 1 mg/mL for MCF7 and 0.5 mg/mL for LTED.
Knock-down of KRT80 was achieved by transfection of two different shRNA
expression vectors and a scrambled negative control obtained from OriGene. Cells
carrying the corresponding construct were selected with Puromycin (Sigma-
Aldrich) at a final concentration of 1 ug/mL for MCF7 and 0.5 ug/mL for LTED cell
line. NucLight Red Lentivirus (IncuCyte, 4627) was used to infect MCF7 and
generate MCF7 mKate2. Stable and polyclonal cell populations were established
after Zeocin selection (300 μg/ml).

 Live cell imaging and data analysis. Live cell imaging was performed on Incu-
Cyte ZOOM (Essen BioScience) equipped with temperature, humidity and CO2
control. Images were acquired every 6 h with 10× plan fluorescence objectives for
the proliferation assay. Data were analyzed and plotted using Prism6. Individual
cells were counted longitudinally to verify absence/presence of proliferation/
cell death.
TAD analysis. TADs were identified using Hi-C data from IMR90 and H1 stem
cells as described in ref. 7 (http://chromosome.sdsc.edu/mouse/hi-c/download.
html). Acetylation profiles were averaged on each TAD locus and difference in
normalized read numbers between TAD loci from MCF7 cells or ET-treated cells
were calculated. Difference were expressed in terms of positive or negative ratios
and ranked according to increase or decrease acetylation7. The Type II Keratin
Locus was identified within the top 5% of TAD which increase acetylation during
the acquisition of ET-resistance (comparing MCF7 with LTED cells7). In the
current manuscript we have used a similar strategy while comparing MCF7 with
all ET derivatives. Actual averaged read number/TAD are now plotted in Fig. 1a
according to each cell line.
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR. Cells were washed with PBS and harvested using
a cell lifter (Corning) in RLT buffer supplemented with 1% β-mercaptoethanol.
Cell lysate was homogenized using QIAshredder columns (QIAGEN) and RNA
extraction was performed with RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) following manu-
facturer´s instructions. RNA concentration was measured using a NanoDrop 1000
Spectrophotometer and 0.5–2 μg of RNA were retrotranscribed using High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR
(qPCR) was performed using 2× SYBR GREEN Mix (Invitrogen) and expression
levels of each gene were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method, normalizing
expression levels to 28S transcript.
Protein extraction, quantification, and western blotting. Cells were harvested in
50 μL ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris- HCl at pH 8.0, with 150 mM sodium
chloride, 1.0% Igepal CA-630 (NP-40), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate) (Sigma; #R02780), supplemented with 1× protease (Roche;
#11697498001) and 1× phosphatase (Sigma; #93482) inhibitor cocktail. The cell
pellet and RIPA were mixed by pipetting up and down, incubated at 4 oC for 30
min and vortexed every 5 min. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
30 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were transferred to a new 1.5 mL eppendorf tube
and the pellets were discarded. Protein concentration was measured using BCA
Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher) following manufacturer’s instructions. With regard to
western blotting, 20 μg of protein per sample, were mixed with 4× Bolt sample
buffer (Life Technologies; #B0007), 10× Bolt sample reducing agent (Life Tech-
nologies; #B0009), ddH2O and heated at 95 oC prior to loading. Protein lysate were
loaded into BOLT 4-12% Bis-Tris Plus Gel (Life Technologies; NW04120BOX).
The pre-made gel was placed into a mini gel tank (Life Technologies; #A25977)
containing 1× Bolt running buffer (Life Technologies). Electrophoresis was carried
out at 90 V for 35 min to allow proteins to adequately run through and also until
the bromophenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gels. The gels were transferred
into a Biotrace nitrocellulose membrane (VWR; #PN66485) using a TE-22 transfer
unit (Hoefer GE Healthcare) at 100 V for 90 min. The membrane was incubated in
blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature to reduce non-specific binding of
primary antibody. The membrane was then incubated with the diluted primary

antibody incubation, the membrane was washed three times in PBST (5 min per
wash on a rocking platform) and then incubated for 1 h with the HRP-GAPDH
(Abcam; #ab9482 (1:5000 dilution)) conjugated antibody (for the loading control
membrane) which was diluted in 5% BSA/PBST and goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L)
Cross Absorbed secondary antibody, HRP 1:20000 dilution (ThermoFisher Sci-
entific; #31462). The membranes (including the loading control membrane) were
washed three times in PBST. Amersham ECL start Western Blotting Detection
reagent (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; #RPN3243) was used for chemiluminescent
imaging using the Fusion solo (Vilber; Germany) imager.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). For ChIP, cells were fixed with 1%
formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C and reaction was quenched with 0.1 M glycine.
The cells were subsequently washed twice with PBS after which they were lysed
in lysis buffer (LB) 1 (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 40 mM NaCL, 1 mM EDTA,
10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.15% Triton X-100), for 10 min, then for 5 min in LB 2
(10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA and 0.5 mM EGTA) and
subsequently eluted in LB 3 for sonication (10 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, and 0.5%N-laur-
oylsarcosine). DNA was sheared using the Bioruptor® Pico sonication device
(High, 10 cycles of 30” on and 30” off) (Diagenode). Sheared chromatin was cleared
by centrifugation. Magnetic beads were precoated by adding 10 μg of antibody
Rabbit-anti-SREBP1 (H-160): sc-8984 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); Rabbit-
anti-Histone H3 acetyl K27 antibody (abcam, ab4729); Rabbit- anti-Histone H3
(monomethyl K4) antibody (abcam, ab8895); Rabbit- anti-Histone H3 (dimethyl
K4) antibody (abcam, ab7766) to 50 μl magnetic beads per ChIP (Dynabeads
protein A, Life technologies) and incubated for 6 h on a rotating platform at 4 °C.
Diluted sheared chromatin was added to the coated magnetic beads and incubated
on a rotating platform at 4 °C O/N. Ten microliter of sheared chromatin taken as
input and treated the same. The next day magnetic bead complexes were washed
three times with RIPA buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.6, 1 mM EDTA, 0.7% Na
deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5 M LiCL) and two times with TE buffer (10 mM Tris
pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). DNA is O/N eluted from the beads in 100 μl de-crosslinking
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS) at 65 °C. After overnight
de-crosslinking, DNA was treated with 2.7 μl of 1 mg/ml RibonucleaseA (RNaseA)
for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently incubated with 1.3 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase
K (Invitrogen) for 1 h at 55 °C. Then DNA extraction was performed using SPRI
magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter, B23318). After elution in TE buffer, DNA was
quantified using Qubit (ThermoFisher Scientific; Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer; #Q33216)
high sensitivity assay (ThermoFisher Scientific; #33216). Quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (qPCR) was then carried out (Applied Biosystems; #7900HT Real
time PCR, #StePOnePlus). If sufficient enrichment is seen in the antibody treat-
ment samples over the ‘input’ samples and compared with internal negative con-
trols, these undergo DNA size selection and library preparation.
Library preparation and ChIP-seq data analysis. Prior to sequencing, ChIP
samples were library prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II DNA Library Prep Kit
for Illumina (New England Biolabs, NEBNext Ultra II DNA library prep kit for
Illumina, #E7770, NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina, #E7335L). Adaptor
ligated DNA was size selected with SPRI magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter,
B23318) which aims to retain DNA fragments between 200–300 base pairs (bp),
recognizable for the Illumina sequencer (#NextSeq500). After library preparation,
we performed qPCR, high sensitivity DNA quantification and size selection mea-
surement (Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system + High sensitivity DNA measurement
assay; 5067–4626) before sending samples for sequencing. Raw sequencing files
processed by the Illumina NextSeq500 sequencer were obtained in “FASTQ” for-
mat. The raw sequencing files were then aligned to the genome using Bowtie
1.11 short reads sequence aligner using the human reference genome 19 (Hg19) as
the reference genome. The output of Bowtie 1.1.1 is the “SAM” file extension
format, for both input (control) and ChIP samples, which were then used by

 Illumina Next Seq machine (#NextSeq500). Reads were processed using Kallisto
and DEGS were called using Sleuth41.
For single cell RNA-seq analyses, only cells showing at least 5000 detected
transcripts were considered. Single-cell experiments were performed as described38.
Briefly, cells were processed using 10× genomics platform (v2.3 kits). Barcodes
were demultiplexed using 10× internal pipeline. Expression profiles from MCF7
cells either from red media (n = 1227) or two days of estrogen-deprivation (n =
1193) were then normalized using the R package Scran (v1.6.9)42. Differential
expression between the two conditions was estimated using the Two-sample
Likelihood Ratio Test implemented in the LRT function of the MAST R package
(v1.4.1)43.
Single cell RNA-FISH. Cell were cultured, fixed and pretreated according to the
protocol for the RNAscope® Multiplex Fluorescent Reagent Kit v2 Assay provided
by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (ACD, #323100, Nunc Lab Tek II 2 Well Glass
Slides, #154461K). The probes were as follows: RNAscope® 3-plex Positive Control
Probe (320861), RNAscope® Negative Control Probe – Bacillus subtilis dihy-
drodipicolinate reductase (dapB) gene (310043), RNAscope® Target Probe C1
(20ZZ probe named Hs-KRT80 targeting 294-1445 of NM_182507.2, 300031),
RNAscope® Target Probe C2 (RNAscope® Probe - Hs-SQLE 465071, 300031),
RNAscope® Target Probe C2 (20ZZ probe named Hs-SREBF1 targeting 958-2002
of NM_001005291.2, 300031) and RNAscope® Probe - Hs-HMGCR (RNAscope®
Target Probes, 470561). The assay was run following the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions, hybridization was performed overnight. PerkinElmer TSA Plus Fluorophores
(fluorescein, NEL741001KT and Cyanin 3, NEL744001KT) were diluted at 1:1300
and assigned to the channels HRP-C1 and HRP-C2, respectively. Fluorophores:
PerkinElmer TSA Plus Fluorescein System (NEL741001KT) and PerkinElmer
TSA Plus Cyanine 3 System (NEL744001KT). Samples were imaged using a ×60
objective with a Ti Nikon microscope equipped with a spinning disk (CAIRN)
and analysed in Image J.
3D Organoid assay. A total of 250,000 cells were resuspended in 1 mL of the
corresponding media and 20 μL drops were placed in the lid of a 10 cm dish
(Corning). The lid was flipped over the dish containing 5 mL of media in order
to prevent evaporation. Hanging drops were incubated for 5 days at 37% C in a
humidified atmosphere, during which formation of organoids was achieved. Before
being included in 3D matrix for the invasion assay, the organoids were collected
and labeled with 10 μM CellTracker™ Green CMFDA (Thermo Fisher, Waltham,
USA) dye by incubating them in serum free media for 45 min at 5% CO2. Labeling
solution was removed, and spheroids were washed in cell medium. To follow,
spheroids were centrifuged at 300 rpm, immersed in 10 μL of phenol-red free
Matrigel® (BD Biosciences) and placed in a 24 well-plate (Corning) The appro-
priate media containing G418 or puromycin was subsequently added to the well.
Brightfield images were acquired at days zero and day two using an EVOS
microscope (Advanced Microscopy Group, Life Technologies). Images were ana-
lyzed using Fiji ImageJ software and fold-change area was calculated using the
following formula: Area (fold-change) = Area Day 2/Area Day 0.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Organoids were washed with
PBS and fixed for 15 min with 4% PFA/PBS. Fixation was stopped by rinsing with
100 mM Glycine/PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton/PBS X-100
and unspecific binding was blocked with blocking solution (5% BSA, 0.2% Triton
X-100, 0.05% Tween in PBS) for 90 min. Organoids were then incubated with
primary antibody (Rabbit Anti-KRT80 1:200, Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h, washed three
times with washing buffer (0.2% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% Tween in PBS),
and incubated with secondary antibody (Goat Anti-Rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 1:200,
Invitrogen) for 45 min. Organoids were washed with immunofluorescence buffer
for 20 min and PBS for 10 min. Finally, organoids were mounted in Moviol
(AppliChem) containing 5 μg/mL of DAPI (Lonza) and visualized using a Zeiss
LSM-780 inverted confocal microscope.
Immunofluorescence. Cells were seeded on glass bottom 24 well plates (MatTek)
coated with 10 µg/ml fibronectin (Sigma), fixed in 4% PFA and permeabilized in
PBS with 0.2% Triton X. The samples were blocked in 3% BSA with 0.1% PBS
Tween (PBST) for 3 h. The primary antibodies (Cortactin, 05-180, Millipore, 1:100;
Keratin-80, HPA077836, Sigma Atlas, 1:100; Phospho-Paxillin-pY118, 44-722 g,
Invitrogen, 1:100) were diluted in 3% BSA in 0.1% PBS Tween and incubated
overnight at 4 °C. The wells were then washed 3 times in 3% BSA 0.1% PBST for
10 min, followed by the addition of the appropriate secondary antibody (Alexa
Fluor, Invitrogen), DAPI (Sigma) and FITC-phalloidin (Sigma). Imaging was
performed using Leica SP8 Confocal microscope.
Image analyses. Cells stained for KRT80 and F-actin (Phalloidin) were imaged
with a ×63 oil immersion objective. Cells were assessed for lamellipodia formation
based on morphology and formation of lamellipodial structures. Only cells at the
border of clusters were evaluated. Cells were positive if a clear membrane ruffle and
lamellipodia towards the leading edge (i.e., free space) was observed. Values
represent the percentage of positive cells per field of view. Analysis of F-actin and
KRT80 fluorescence intensity was performed in confocal images acquired at the
same time at identical laser settings. Analyses of F-actin at different cell regions
were performed using Image J, analyzing 2–3 representative cells at the border of
clusters per image. Areas at the cell cortex, lamellipodia and cytosol were delineated
using the free-hand drawing function and area and mean F-actin fluorescence
intensity measured. To calculate the overall (i.e., whole cell) fluorescence intensity,
the total intensity of cortical, lamellipodial and cytosolic F-actin was calculated and
divided by the total area analyzed. Line scan analyses were generated using the line
intensity function in Leica’s Application Suite X software. The fluorescence
intensity of F-actin and KRT80 as a function of the distance from the cell edge
was obtained from confocal images acquired at the same time at identical laser
settings. Lines (12.5 µm) used for the analysis are indicated in the respective figures.
Values correspond to the relative fluorescence intensity for each staining.
For analysis of pY118-paxillin adhesion size, cells were imaged using a ×63 oil
immersion objective and analyzed using Volocity (Perkin Elmer). Only cells at
the border of clusters (leading edge) were analyzed. Individual pY118-Paxillin
adhesions towards the leading edge were identified, selected using the magnetic
lasso tool and the size measured using Volocity. Values represent the mean FA size
in μm2 per cell. For quantification of focal adhesion number, individual cells were
identified and the number of pY118-paxillin adhesions at the leading edge per
cell was manually quantified.
To determine the mean cortactin (CTTN) fluorescence intensity, cells were
imaged using a ×63 oil immersion objective at the basal plane. Individual cells were
identified, selected and the mean fluorescence intensity per cell was determined
using Volocity. Values correspond to the mean CTTN fluorescence intensity per
cell for each staining.
Tissue specimens. Seventy-five human breast specimens and ten metastatic
lymph nodes were selected from Histopathology Department at Charing Cross
Hospital, with the previous approval of Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust
Tissue Bank.
A Tissue Microarray (TMA) containing 26 primary breast tumors and paired
ETR relapses was constructed as previously described18.
Immunohistochemistry staining was scored using a quick score system by two
independent investigators, one of them a consultant pathologist (SS). Score was
calculated as follows: S = 3 (strongly stained cells), S = 2 (moderate staining), S = 1
(poorly stained cells), and S = 0 (absence of staining). Staining intensity was
assessed as mean intensity from the tumor region contained within the TMA.
A second set of tissues (pre and post-adjuvant therapy) was constructed at the
Istituto Nazionale Tumori (Milan) with material from the INT Tissue Bank. All
specimens were obtained from consented-patients (Imperial College NHS and INT
tissue banks).
Immunohistochemistry. Formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue
specimens were sliced in 4 μm sections using a Leica RM2235 manual microtome.
Dried sections were de-waxed by immersion in xylene and rehydrated with sub-
sequent immersion in 100% ethanol, 70 % ethanol and distilled water. Antigen
retrieval was performed by immersion in PBS 0.01 M citric acid pH 6 and heated at
800 W for 15 min. Slides were rinsed in PBS and endogenous peroxidase activity
was blocked for 30 min using Dako RealTM Peroxidase Blocking Solution. Fol-
lowing that, slides were rinsed twice with PBS and incubated with 10% pig serum
(Bio-Rad) for 30 min and overnight with KRT80 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, 1:200).
Following day, slides were rinsed in PBS and incubated 30 min with secondary
antibody (biotinylated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG 1:200, Vector Laboratories) and 30
min with an avidin/biotin peroxidase-based system (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC
Kit, Vector Laboratories). Color reaction was developed for 1 min using DAB
(Diaminobenzidine, Vector ImmPACT DAB Peroxidase Substrate). Color devel-
opment was stopped by immersion during 5 min in running tap water and fol-
lowing that, nuclei was stained with haematoxylin. Slides were dehydrated in 100%
ethanol, cleared in xylene and mounted in DPX (SIGMA).
Statistical analysis. Data is presented as mean ± SD (standard deviation) in most
figures. Whenever this is not the case, the figure legends states the exact details.
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 6 software. Statistics are
described in details in each figure legend. Generally, Student t test and one-way
ANOVA were applied. The sue of additional statistical methods, such as non-
parametric Mann–Whitney test, are described in individual figure legends.
Survival analysis. Publicly available breast cancer datasets were identified in GEO
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), EGA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega/home), and
TCGA (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/). Only cohorts including at least 30 patients
and with available follow-up data were included. Samples derived using different
technological platforms (Affymetrix gene chips, Illumina gene chips, RNA-seq)
were processed independently. For KRT80, the probe set 231849_at was used in the
Affymetrix dataset, the probe ILMN_1705814 was used in the Illumina dataset
and the gene 144501 was used in the RNA-seq dataset. Cox proportional hazards
survival analysis was performed as described previously44. Kaplan–Meier plots
were derived to visualize survival differences. In the multivariate analysis, the RNA
expression of ERα, HER2, and MKI67 were used as surrogate markers for ER and
HER2 status, and for proliferation. In this, the probe sets 205225_at, 216836_s_at,

 and 212021_s_at were used for ERα, HER2, and MKI67, respectively. The survival
analysis was performed for relapse-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS), and
post-progression survival (PPS). PPS was computed by extracting the RFS time
from the OS time for patients having both RFS and OS data and having an event
for RFS. Censoring data for PPS was derived from the OS event. The survival
analysis was performed in the R statistical environment.
Cellular microrheology. To characterize the mechanical properties of the four
different BC cell lines, we used magnetic tweezer microrheology to measure cell
deformation in response to magnetically generated forces. Tensional magnetic
forces were induced by a high gradient magnetic field generated by an electro-
magnetic tweezer device. The positioning of the tip of the magnetic tweezer device
was controlled by an electronic micromanipulator. Superparamagnetic 4.5 µm
epoxylated beads (Dynabeads, Life Technologies) were coated with fibronectin
(40 μg per 8 × 107 beads, Sigma Aldrich F0895) and incubated with adherent cells
for 30 min, prior to measurements, to allow integrin binding and provide a
mechanical link between the bead and the cytoskeleton. The unbound beads were
removed by multiple washing with PBS. The experiments were performed at 37 °C,
5% CO2 and 95% humidity in DMEM containing 2% FΒS in a microscope stage
incubation chamber. A viscoelastic creep experiment was conducted by applying
mechanical tension onto single beads bound on the apical surface of the cells with a
constant pulling force (F0 = 1 nN) for 3 s generated by the magnetic tweezers. The
viscoelastic creep response of the cells was recorded by tracking the resulting bead
displacement in brightfield (×40 objective at 20 frames per second, Nikon Eclipse
Ti-B) that is indicative of the local cytoskeletal deformation. A custom-built
MATLAB algorithm was then used to analyze the image sequences and track bead
displacement by following the intensity-weighted centroid of the bead across all
captured frames. The viscoelastic creep response J(t) of cells during force appli-
cation followed a power-law in time J(t) = J0(t/t0)β with the prefactor J0 repre-
senting cell compliance (J0 = inverse of cell stiffness in units of kPa−1) and the
dimensionless exponent β representing cell fluidity with values ranging between 0
< β < 1 pure elastic (β = 0) or viscous behavior (β = 1) and with the reference time
t0 was set to 1 s. The creep compliance J(t) represents the ratio (γ(t)/σ0) of the
localized cellular strain γ(t) induced by the applied stress from the magnetic
tweezers σ0, with γ(t) taken as the radial bead displacement normalized over the
bead radius γ(t) = d(t)/r and the applied stress as σ0 = F0/4πr2 taken as the applied
force normalized over the bead cross sectional area. Compliance measurements for
each BC cell line were collected from three independent experiments (MCF7 CTRL
n = 60, MCF7 KRT80 n = 34, LTED CTRL n = 41, LTED KRT80 n = 34).
Shearwave elastography. All individuals involved were consented prior to
measurements collection. All SWE was performed by a breast radiologist with more
than 10-years’ experience of performing Breast ultrasound and elastography on
breast lesions. A state-of-the-art ultrasound scanner, Aplio i900 (Canon Medical
Systems, Nasu, Japan) with the latest 2D SWE technology was used for this study.
All SWE maps and calculations were obtained pre-biopsy. A good stand-off was
used for superficial lesions and initially, continuous SWE mode (“multi-shot”) was
used to select the optimum plane and once this was stabilized, a higher energy SWE
push-pulse (“one-shot” mode) was then utilized to obtain the final elastogram for
calculations. Regions of interest (ROI) were placed within the center of the lesion,
in the periphery and also within the adjacent normal breast tissue. This has
been stored as raw data within the ultrasound systems which would enable any
re-calculations as necessary.
