Abstract
Background: Although commonly utilized interventions, no studies have directly compared the effectiveness of
cervical and thoracic manipulation to mobilization and exercise in individuals with cervicogenic headache (CH).
The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of manipulation to mobilization and exercise in individuals
with CH.
Methods: One hundred and ten participants (n = 110) with CH were randomized to receive both cervical and
thoracic manipulation (n = 58) or mobilization and exercise (n = 52). The primary outcome was headache intensity
as measured by the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS). Secondary outcomes included headache frequency,
headache duration, disability as measured by the Neck Disability Index (NDI), medication intake, and the Global
Rating of Change (GRC). The treatment period was 4 weeks with follow-up assessment at 1 week, 4 weeks, and
3 months after initial treatment session. The primary aim was examined with a 2-way mixed-model analysis of
variance (ANOVA), with treatment group (manipulation versus mobilization and exercise) as the between subjects
variable and time (baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks and 3 months) as the within subjects variable.
Results: The 2X4 ANOVA demonstrated that individuals with CH who received both cervical and thoracic
manipulation experienced significantly greater reductions in headache intensity (p < 0.001) and disability (p < 0.001)
than those who received mobilization and exercise at a 3-month follow-up. Individuals in the upper cervical and
upper thoracic manipulation group also experienced less frequent headaches and shorter duration of headaches
at each follow-up period (p < 0.001 for all). Additionally, patient perceived improvement was significantly greater at
1 and 4-week follow-up periods in favor of the manipulation group (p < 0.001).
Conclusions: Six to eight sessions of upper cervical and upper thoracic manipulation were shown to be more
effective than mobilization and exercise in patients with CH, and the effects were maintained at 3 months.

 Background
The International Classification of Headache Disorders
defines
cervicogenic
headache
(CH)
as,
“headache
caused by a disorder of the cervical spine and its compo-
nent bony, disc, and/or soft tissue elements, usually but
not invariably accompanied by neck pain.” [1] (p.760) The
prevalence of CH has been reported to be between 0.4
and 20 % of the headache population [2, 3], and as high
as 53 % in patients with headache after whiplash injury
[4]. The dominant features of CH usually include:
unilaterality of head pain without side-shift, elicitation of
pain with external pressure over the ipsilateral upper
neck, limited cervical range of motion, and the trigger-
ing of attacks by various awkward or sustained neck
movements [4, 5].
Individuals with CH are frequently treated with spinal
manipulative therapy including both mobilization and
manipulation [6]. Spinal mobilization consists of slow,
rhythmical, oscillating techniques whereas manipulation
consists of high-velocity low-amplitude thrust tech-
niques. [7] In a recent systematic review, Bronfort and
colleagues reported that spinal manipulative therapy
(both mobilization and manipulation) were effective in
the management of adults with CH [8]. However, they
did not report if manipulation resulted in superior
outcomes compared to mobilization for the management
of this population.
Several studies have investigated the effect of spinal
manipulation in the management of CH [9–13]. Haas et
al. [10] investigated the effectiveness of cervical manipu-
lation in subjects with CH. Jull et al. [11] demonstrated
treatment
efficacy
for
manipulative
therapy
and/or
exercise in the management of CH. However the ma-
nipulative therapy group included manipulation and
mobilization therefore it cannot be determined if the
beneficial effect was a result of the manipulation,
mobilization or the combination.
A few studies have examined the benefits of manipula-
tion versus mobilization for the management of mechan-
ical neck pain with or without exercise [14–16]. However,
no studies have directly compared the effects of manipula-
tion versus mobilization and exercise in patients with CH.
Considering the purported risks of manipulation [17], it is
essential to determine if manipulation results in improved
outcomes compared to mobilization for the management
of patients with CH. Therefore, the purpose of this ran-
domized clinical trial was to compare the effects of
manipulation versus mobilization and exercise in patients
with CH. We hypothesized that patients receiving ma-
nipulation over a 4-week treatment period would experi-
ence greater reductions in headache intensity, headache
frequency, headache duration, disability, and medication
intake at a 3-month follow-up than patients receiving
cervical and thoracic mobilization combined with exercise.
Methods
Participants
In this multi-center randomized clinical trial, consecutive
patients with CH presenting to 1 of 8 outpatient physical
therapy clinics from a variety of geographical locations
(Arizona, Georgia, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South
Carolina) were recruited over a 29-month period (from
April 2012 to August 2014). For patients to be eligible,
they had to present with a diagnosis of CH according
to the revised diagnostic criteria [5] developed by the
Cervicogenic
Headache
International
Study
Group
(CHISG) [5, 18, 19]. CH was classified according to the
“major criteria” (not including confirmatory evidence
by diagnostic anesthetic blockades) and “head pain
characteristics” of the CHISG. Therefore, in order to be
included in the study, patients had to exhibit all of the
following criteria: (1) unilaterality of the head pain
without sideshift, starting in the upper posterior neck
or occipital region, eventually spreading to the oculo-
frontotemporal area on the symptomatic side, (2) pain
triggered by neck movement and/or sustained awkward
positions, (3) reduced range of motion in the cervical
spine [20] (i.e., less than or equal to 32 ° of right or left
passive rotation on the Flexion-Rotation Test [21–23],
(4) pain elicited by external pressure over at least one
of the upper cervical joints (C0-3), and (5) moderate to
severe, non-throbbing and non-lancinating pain. In
addition, participants had to have a headache frequency
of at least 1 per week for a minimum of 3 months, a
minimum headache intensity pain score of two points
(0–10 on the NPRS scale), a minimum disability score
of 20 % or greater (i.e., 10 points or greater on the
0–50 NDI scale), and be between 18 and 65 years of age.
Patients were excluded if they exhibited other primary
headaches (i.e., migraine, TTH), suffered from bilateral
headaches, or exhibited any red flags (i.e., tumor, frac-
ture, metabolic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, osteopor-
osis, resting blood pressure greater than 140/90 mmHg,
prolonged history of steroid use, etc.), presented with
two or more positive neurologic signs consistent with
nerve root compression (muscle weakness involving a
major muscle group of the upper extremity, diminished
upper extremity deep tendon reflex, or diminished or
absent sensation to pinprick in any upper extremity
dermatome), presented with a diagnosis of cervical
spinal stenosis, exhibited bilateral upper extremity symp-
toms, had evidence of central nervous system involve-
ment (hyperreflexia, sensory disturbances in the hand,
intrinsic muscle wasting of the hands, unsteadiness
during walking, nystagmus, loss of visual acuity, im-
paired sensation of the face, altered taste, the presence
of pathological reflexes), had a history of whiplash injury
within the previous 6 weeks, had prior surgery to the
head or neck, had received treatment for head or neck

 pain from any practitioner within the previous month,
had received physical therapy or chiropractic treat-
ment for head or neck pain within the previous
3 months, or had pending legal action regarding their
head or neck pain.
The
most
recent
literature
suggests
that
pre-
manipulative cervical artery testing is unable to identify
those individuals at risk of vascular complications from
cervical manipulation [24, 25], and any symptoms de-
tected during pre-manipulative testing may be unrelated
to changes in blood flow in the vertebral artery [26, 27].
Hence, pre-manipulative cervical artery testing was not
performed in this study; however, screening questions
for cervical artery disease had to be negative [24, 28, 29].
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Long Island University, Brooklyn, NY. The
study was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov with trial
identifier NCT01580280. All patients were informed that
they would receive either manipulation or mobilization
and exercise and then provided informed consent before
their enrollment in the study.
Treating therapists
Twelve physical therapists (mean age 36.6 years, SD
5.62) participated in the delivery of treatment for pa-
tients in this study. They had an average of 10.3 (SD
5.66, range 3–20 years) years of clinical experience, and
all had completed a 60 h post-graduate certification pro-
gram that included practical training in manual tech-
niques
including
the
use
of
cervical
and
thoracic
manipulation. To ensure all examination, outcome as-
sessments, and treatment procedures were standardized,
all participating physical therapists were required to
study a manual of standard operating procedures and
participate in a 4 h training session with the principal
investigator.
Examination procedures
All patients provided demographic information, com-
pleted the Neck Pain Medical Screening Questionnaire,
and
completed
a
number
of
self-report
measures,
followed by a standardized history and physical examin-
ation at baseline. Self-report measures included head-
ache intensity as measured by the NPRS (0–10), the
NDI (0–50), headache frequency (number of days with
headache in the last week), headache duration (total
hours of headache in the last week), and medication
intake (number of times the patient had taken narcotic
or over-the-counter pain medication in the past week).
The standardized physical examination was not limited
to, but included measurements of C1-2 (atlanto-axial
joint) passive right and left rotation ROM using the
Flexion-Rotation Test (FRT). The inter-rater reliability
for the FRT has been found to be excellent (ICC: 0.93;
95 % CI: 0.87, 0.96) [30].
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure used in this study was
the patient’s headache intensity as measured by the
NPRS. Patients were asked to indicate the average inten-
sity of headache pain over the past week using an 11-
point scale ranging from 0 (“no pain”) to 10 (“worst pain
imaginable”)
at
baseline,
1-week,
1-month,
and
3-
months following the initial treatment session [31]. The
NPRS is a reliable and valid instrument to assess pain in-
tensity [32–34]. Although no data exists in patients with
CH, the MCID for the NPRS has been shown to be 1.3
in patients with mechanical neck pain [32] and 1.74 in
patients with a variety of chronic pain conditions [34].
Therefore, we chose to only include patients with an
NPRS score of 2 points (20 %) or greater.
Secondary outcome measures included the NDI, the
Global Rating of Change (GRC), headache frequency,
headache duration, and medication intake. The NDI is
the most widely used instrument for assessing self-rated
disability in patients with neck pain [35–37]. The NDI is
a self-report questionnaire with 10-items rated from 0
(no disability) to five (complete disability) [38]. The nu-
meric responses for each item are summed for a total
score ranging between 0 and 50; however, some evalua-
tors have chosen to multiply the raw score by two, and
then report the NDI on a 0–100 % scale [36, 39]. Higher
scores represent increased levels of disability. The NDI
has been found to possess excellent test-retest reliability,
strong construct validity, strong internal consistency and
good responsiveness in assessing disability in patients
with mechanical neck pain [36], cervical radiculopathy
[33, 40], whiplash associated disorder [38, 41, 42], and
mixed non-specific neck pain [43, 44]. Although no
studies have examined the psychometric properties of
the NDI in patients with CH, we chose to only include
patients with an NDI score of ten points (20 %) or
greater, because this cut-off score captures the MCID for
the NDI, which has been reported to approximate four,
eight, and nine points (0–50) in patients with mixed
non-specific neck pain [44], mechanical neck pain [45],
and cervical radiculopathy [33], respectively. Headache
frequency was measured as the number of days with
headache in the last week, ranging from 0 to 7 days.
Headache duration was measured as the total hours of
headache in the last week, with six possible ranges: (1)
0–5 h, (2) 6–10 h, (3) 11–15 h, (4) 16–20 h, (5) 21–25 h,
or (6) 26 or more hours. Medication intake was mea-
sured as the number of times the patient had taken
prescription
or
over-the-counter
analgesic
or
anti-
inflammatory medication in the past week for their
headaches, with five options: (1) not at all, (2) once a

Page 3 of 12
 week, (3) once every couple of days, (4) once or twice a
day, or (5) three or more times a day.
Patients returned for 1-week, 4-weeks, and 3-months
follow-ups where the aforementioned outcome measures
were again collected. In addition, at the 1-week, 4-weeks
and 3-months follow-ups, patients completed a 15-point
GRC question based on a scale described by Jaeschke et
al. [46] to rate their own perception of improved func-
tion. The scale ranges from -7 (a very great deal worse)
to zero (about the same) to +7 (a very great deal better).
Intermittent descriptors of worsening or improving are
assigned values from -1 to -6 and +1 to +6, respectively.
The MCID for the GRC has not been specifically re-
ported but scores of +4 and +5 have typically been indi-
cative of moderate changes in patient status [46].
However, it should be noted that recently Schmitt and
Abbott reported that the GRC might not correlate with
changes in function in a population with hip and ankle
injuries [47]. All outcome measures were collected by an
assessor blind to group assignment.
On the initial visit patients completed all outcome
measures then received the first treatment session.
Patients completed 6–8 treatment sessions of either
manipulation or mobilization combined with exercise
over 4 weeks. Additionally, subjects were asked if they
had experienced any “major” adverse events [48, 49]
(stroke or permanent neurological deficits) at each
follow-up period.
Randomization
Following
the
baseline
examination,
patients
were
randomly assigned to receive either manipulation or
mobilization and exercise. Concealed allocation was per-
formed by using a computer-generated randomized table
of numbers created by an individual not involved with
recruiting patients prior to the beginning of the study.
Individual, sequentially numbered index cards with the
random assignment were prepared for each of 8 data
collection sites. The index cards were folded and placed
in sealed opaque envelopes. Blinded to the baseline
examination, the treating therapist opened the envelope
and proceeded with treatment according to the group
assignment. Patients were instructed not to discuss the
particular treatment procedure received with the exam-
ining therapist. The examining therapist remained blind
to the patient’s treatment group assignment at all times;
however, based on the nature of the interventions it was
not possible to blind patients or treating therapists.
Manipulation group
Manipulations targeting the right and left C1-2 articula-
tions and bilateral T1-2 articulations were performed on
at least one of the 6–8 treatment sessions (Figs. 1 and
2).
On
other
treatment
sessions,
therapists
either
repeated the C1-2 and/or T1-2 manipulations or tar-
geted other spinal articulations (i.e., C0-1, C2-3, C3-7,
T2-9, ribs 1–9) using manipulation. The selection of the
spinal segments to target was left to the discretion of the
treating therapist and it was based on the combination
of patient reports and manual examination. For both the
upper cervical and upper thoracic manipulations, if no
popping or cracking sound was heard on the first
attempt, the therapist repositioned the patient and
performed a second manipulation. A maximum of 2 at-
tempts were performed on each patient similar to other

 studies [14, 50–53]. The clinicians were instructed that
the manipulations are likely to be accompanied by mul-
tiple audible popping sounds [54–58]. Patients were en-
couraged to maintain usual activity within the limits of
pain; however, mobilization and the prescription of exer-
cises, or any use of other modalities, were not provided
to this group.
The manipulation targeting C1-2 was performed with
the patient in supine. For this technique, the patient’s
left posterior arch of the atlas was contacted with the
lateral aspect of the proximal phalanx of the therapist’s
left second finger using a “cradle hold”. To localize the
forces to the left C1-2 articulation, the patient was posi-
tioned using extension, a posterior-anterior (PA) shift,
ipsilateral side-bend and contralateral side-shift. While
maintaining this position, the therapist performed a sin-
gle high-velocity, low-amplitude thrust manipulation to
the left atlanto-axial joint using right rotation in an arc
toward the underside eye and translation toward the
table (Fig. 1). This was repeated using the same proced-
ure but directed to the right C1-2 articulation.
The manipulation targeting T1-2 was performed with
the patient in supine. For this technique, the patient held
her/his arms and forearms across the chest with the el-
bows aligned in a superoinferior direction. The therapist
contacted the transverse processes of the lower vertebrae
of the target motion segment with the thenar eminence
and middle phalanx of the third digit. The upper lever
was localized to the target motion segment by adding ro-
tation away and side-bend towards the therapist while
the underside hand used pronation and radial deviation
to achieve rotation toward and side-bend away mo-
ments, respectively. The space inferior to the xiphoid
process and costochondral margin of the therapist was
used as the contact point against the patient’s elbows to
deliver a manipulation in an anterior to posterior direc-
tion targeting T1-2 bilaterally (Fig. 2).
Mobilization and exercise group
Mobilizations targeting the right and left C1-2 articula-
tions and bilateral T1-2 articulations were performed on
at least one of the 6–8 treatment sessions. On other
treatment sessions, therapists either repeated the C1-2
and/or T1-2 mobilizations or targeted other spinal artic-
ulations (i.e., C0-1, C2/3, C3-7, T2-9, ribs 1–9) using
mobilization. The selection of the spinal segments to tar-
get was left to the discretion of the treating therapist
and it was based on the combination of patient reports
and manual examination. However, in order to avoid a
“contact” or “attention effect” when compared with the
manipulation
group,
therapists
were
instructed
to
mobilize one cervical segment (i.e., right and left) and
one thoracic segment or rib articulation on each treat-
ment session.
The mobilization targeting the C1-2 articulation was
performed in prone. For this technique, the therapist
performed one 30 s bout of left-sided unilateral grade IV
PA mobilizations to the C1-2 motion segment as
described by Maitland [7]. This same procedure was
repeated for one 30 s bout to the right atlanto-axial joint.
In addition, and on at least one session, mobilization
directed to the upper thoracic (T1-2) spine with the
patient prone was performed. For this technique, the
therapist performed one 30 s bout of central grade IV PA
mobilizations to the T1-2 motion segment as described
by Maitland [7]. Therefore, we used 180 (i.e., three 30 s
bouts at approximately 2 Hz) end-range oscillations in
total on each subject for the mobilization treatment.
Notably, there is no high quality evidence to date to
suggest that longer durations of mobilization result in
greater pain reduction than shorter durations or dosages
of mobilization [59, 60].
Cranio-cervical flexion exercises [11, 61–63] were per-
formed with the patient in supine, with the knees bent
and the position of the head standardized by placing the
craniocervical and cervical spines in a mid-position, such
that a line between the subject’s forehead and chin was
horizontal, and a horizontal line from the tragus of the
ear bisected the neck longitudinally. An air-filled pres-
sure biofeedback unit (Chattanooga Group, Inc., Hixson,
TN) was placed suboccipitally behind the patient’s neck
and preinflated to a baseline of 20 mmHg [63]. For the
staged exercises, patients were required to perform the
craniocervical flexion action (“a nod of the head, similar
to indicating yes”) [63] and attempt to visually target
pressures of 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 mmHg from a resting
baseline of 20 mmHg and to hold the position steady for
10 s [61, 62]. The action of nodding was performed in a
gentle and slow manner. A 10 s rest was allowed
between trials. If the pressure deviated below the target
pressure, the pressure was not held steady, substitution
with
the
superficial
flexors
(sternocleidomastoid
or
anterior scalene) occurred, or neck retraction was no-
ticed before the completion of the 10 s isometric hold, it
was regarded as a failure [63]. The last successful target
pressure was used to determine each patient’s exercise
level wherein 3 sets of 10 repetitions with a 10 s isomet-
ric hold were performed. In addition to mobilizations
and cranio-cervical flexion exercises, patients were re-
quired to perform 10 min of progressive resistance
exercises (i.e., using Therabands® or free weights) to the
muscles of the shoulder girdle during each treatment
session, within their own tolerance, and specifically fo-
cusing on the lower trapezius and serratus anterior [11].
Sample size

 Center (Boston, MA). The calculations were based on
detecting a 2-point (or 20 %) difference in the NPRS
(headache intensity) at the 3 months follow-up, assum-
ing a standard deviation of three points, a 2-tailed test,
and an alpha level equal to 0.05. This generated a sample
size of 49 patients per group. Allowing for a conservative
dropout rate of 10 %, we planned to recruit at least 108
patients into the study. This sample size yielded greater
than 90 % power to detect a statistically significant
change in the NPRS scores.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics, including frequency counts for cat-
egorical variables and measures of central tendency and
dispersion for continuous variables were calculated to
summarize the data. The effects of treatment on head-
ache intensity and disability were each examined with a
2-by-4 mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA), with
treatment group (manipulation versus mobilization and
exercise) as the between-subjects variable and time
(baseline, 1 week, 4 weeks, and 3 months follow-up) as
the within-subjects variable. Separate ANOVAs were
performed with the NPRS (headache intensity) and NDI
(disability) as the dependent variable. For each ANOVA,
the hypothesis of interest was the 2-way interaction
(group by time).
An independent t-test was used to determine the be-
tween group differences for the percentage change from
baseline to 3-month follow-up in both headache inten-
sity and disability. Separate Mann–Whitney U tests were
performed with the headache frequency, GRC, headache
duration and medication intake as the dependent vari-
able. We performed Little’s Missing Completely at
Random (MCAR) test [64] to determine if missing data
points associated with dropouts were missing at random
or missing for systematic reasons. Intention-to-treat ana-
lysis was performed by using Expectation-Maximization
whereby missing data are computed using regression
equations. Planned pairwise comparisons were per-
formed examining the difference between baseline and
follow-up periods between-groups using the Bonferroni
correction at an alpha level of .05.
We dichotomized patients as responders at the 3-
month follow-up using a cut score of 2 points improve-
ment for headache intensity as measured by the NPRS.
Numbers needed to treat (NNT) and 95 % confidence
intervals (CI) were also calculated at the 3 months
follow-up period using each of these definitions for a
successful outcome. Data analysis was performed using
SPSS 21.0.
Results
Two hundred and fifty-one patients with a primary com-
plaint of headaches were screened for possible eligibility.
The reasons for ineligibility can be found in Fig. 3, the
flow diagram of patient recruitment and retention. Of
the 251 patients screened, 110 patients, with a mean
age of 35.16 years (SD 11.48) and a mean duration of
symptoms of 4.56 years (SD 6.27), satisfied the eligi-
bility criteria, agreed to participate, and were random-
ized into manipulation (n = 58) and mobilization and
exercise (n = 52) groups. Baseline variables for each
group can be found in Table 1. Twelve therapists
from 8 outpatient physical therapy clinics each treated
25, 23, 20, 14, 13, 7, 6 or 2 patients, respectively; fur-
thermore, each of the 12 therapists treated approxi-
mately an equal proportion of patients in each group.
There was no significant difference (p = 0.227) be-
tween the mean number of completed treatment ses-
sions for the manipulation group (7.17, SD 0.96) and
the mobilization and exercise group (6.90, SD 1.35).
In addition, the mean number of treatment sessions
that targeted the C1-2 articulation was 6.41 (SD 1.63)
for the manipulation group and 6.52 (SD 2.01) for the
mobilization and exercise group, and this was not sig-
nificantly different (p = 0.762). One hundred seven of
the 110 patients completed all outcome measures
through 3 months (97 % follow-up). Little’s Missing
Completely at Random (MCAR) test was not statisti-
cally significant (p = 0.281); therefore, we used the
Expectation-Maximization imputation technique to re-
place missing values with predicted values for the
missing 3-month outcomes.
The overall group by time interaction for the primary
outcome of headache intensity was statistically signifi-
cant for the NPRS (F(3,106) = 11.196; p < 0.001; partial eta
squared = 0.24). Between-group differences revealed that
the manipulation group experienced statistically signifi-
cant greater improvement in the NPRS at both the 1-
week (2.1, 95 % CI: 1.2, 2.9), 4-week (2.3, 95 % CI: 1.5,
3.1) and 3-month (2.1, 95 % CI: 1.2, 3.0) follow-up
periods (Table 2). In addition, an independent samples t-
test revealed the between-group difference in percentage
change in headache intensity (36.58 %, 95 % CI: 22.52,
50.64) from baseline to 3-month follow-up was statisti-
cally significant (t(108) = 5.156; p < 0.001) in favor of
manipulation. See Table 3 for the percentage of subjects
gaining 50, 75, and 100 % reduction in headache inten-
sity at 3 months.
For secondary outcomes a significant group by time
interaction existed for the NDI (F(3,106) = 8.57; p < 0.001;
partial eta squared = 0.20). At each follow-up period the
manipulation group had superior outcomes in disability
reduction as compared to the mobilization and exercise
group. An independent samples t- test revealed the
between-group mean percentage change in disability
(35.56 %, 95 % CI: 24.95, 46.17) from baseline to 3 months
follow-up was statistically significant (t(108) = 6.646, p <

 0.001); indicating the manipulation group experienced a
significantly greater percentage in disability reduction

Mann–Whitney U tests revealed that patients in the
upper cervical and upper thoracic manipulation group
experienced less frequent headaches at 1 week (p <
0.001; median 2.0 versus 3.0), 4 weeks (p < 0.001; me-
dian 1.0 versus 3.0) and 3 months (p < 0.001; median

(p < 0.001; median 1.0 versus 2.0) and 3 months (p <
0.001; median 1.0 versus 2.0) in the manipulation
group. Additionally, patient perceived improvement as
measured by the GRC was significantly greater at

compared to the mobilization and exercise group.
Based on the cutoff score of 2 points on the NPRS, the
NNT was 4.0 (95 % CI: 2.3, 7.7) in favor of the manipu-
lation group at 3-month follow-up.
We did not collect any data on the occurrence of
“minor” adverse events [48, 49] (transient neurological
symptoms, increased stiffness, radiating pain, fatigue or
other); however, no “major” adverse events [48, 49]
(stroke or permanent neurological deficits) were re-
ported for either group.

 cervical and thoracic manipulation to mobilization and
exercise in patients with CH. The results suggest 6–8
sessions of manipulation over 4 weeks, directed mainly
to both the upper cervical (C1-2) and upper thoracic
(T1-2) spines, resulted in greater improvements in head-
ache intensity, disability, headache frequency, headache
duration,
and
medication
intake
than
mobilization
combined
with
exercises.
The
point
estimates
for
between-group
changes
in
headache
intensity
(2.1
points) and disability (6.0 points or 12.0 %) exceeded the
reported MCIDs for both measures. Although the MCID
for the NDI in patients with CH has not yet been inves-
tigated, it should however be noted that the lower bound
estimate of the 95 % CI for disability (3.5 points) was
slightly below (or approximated in two cases) the MCID
that has been found to be 3.5 [65], 5 [66], and 7.5 [45]
points in patients with mechanical neck pain, 8.5 [33]
points in patients with cervical radiculopathy, and 3.5
[44] points in patients with mixed, non-specific neck
pain. However, it should be recognized that both
groups made clinical improvement. In addition, the
NNT suggests for every four patients treated with
manipulation, rather than mobilization, one additional
patient achieves clinically important pain reduction at
3 months follow-up.
Strengths and weaknesses of the study
The inclusion of 12 treating physical therapists from 8
private clinics in 6 different geographical states enhances
the overall generalizability of our findings. Although
significant differences were recognized up to 3 months, it
is not known if these benefits would have been sustained
at long-term. In addition, we used high-velocity, low-
amplitude
manipulation
techniques
that
employed
bidirectional thrusts into rotation and translation simul-
taneously and Maitland based grade IV PA mobilization
techniques; thus, we cannot be certain that these results
are generalizable to other kinds of manual therapy tech-
niques. Some might argue that the comparison group
might have not received adequate intervention. We sought
to balance internal and external validity so standardized
treatment for both groups and provided a very explicit
description of the techniques used which will also allow
for replication. Furthermore, we did not measure minor
adverse events and only asked about two potential major
adverse events. Another limitation is that we included
multiple secondary outcomes. Therapist preferences as to
which technique they thought would be superior was not
collected and potentially could impact the results.
Strengths and weaknesses in relation to other studies:
important differences in results
Jull et al. [11] demonstrated treatment efficacy for ma-
nipulative therapy and exercise in the management of
CH; however, this treatment package included both
mobilization and manipulation. The current study may
provide evidence that the management of patients with
CH should include some form of manipulation despite
the fact it is often suggested that cervical manipulation
should be avoided because of the risk of serious adverse
events [67, 68]. Furthermore, it has been shown that in-
dividuals receiving spinal manipulation for neck pain
and headaches are no more likely to experience a verteb-
robasilar stroke than if they received treatment by their
medical physician [69]. Additionally, after reviewing 134
case reports, Puentedura et al. concluded that with ap-
propriate selection of patients by careful screening of
red flags and contraindications, the majority of adverse
events associated with cervical manipulation could have
been prevented [70].
Meaning of the study: possible explanations and
implications for clinicians and policymakers
Based on the results of the current study clinicians
should consider incorporating spinal manipulation for
individuals with CH. A recent systematic review found
both mobilization and manipulation to be effective for
the management of patients with CH but was unable to
determine which technique was superior [8]. Addition-
ally,
clinical
guidelines
reported
that
manipulation,
mobilization and exercise were all effective for the man-
agement of patients with CH; however, the guideline
made no suggestions regarding the superiority of either
technique. [71] The current results may assist authors of
future systematic reviews and clinical guidelines in pro-
viding more specific recommendations about the use of
spinal manipulation in this population.
Unanswered questions and future research
The underlying mechanisms as to why manipulation
may have resulted in greater improvements remains to
be elucidated. It has been suggested that high-velocity
displacement of vertebrae with impulse durations of less
than 200 ms may alter afferent discharge rates [72] by
stimulating
mechanoreceptors
and
proprioceptors,
thereby changing alpha motorneuron excitability levels
and subsequent muscle activity [72–74]. Manipulation
might also stimulate receptors in the deep paraspinal
musculature, and mobilization might be more likely to
facilitate receptors in the superficial muscles [75]. Bio-
mechanical [76, 77], spinal or segmental [78, 79] and
central descending inhibitory pain pathway [80–83]
models are plausible explanations for the hypoalgesic ef-
fects observed following manipulation. Recently, the bio-
mechanical effects of manipulation have been under
scientific scrutiny [84], and it is plausible that the clin-
ical benefits found in our study are associated with a
neurophysiological response involving temporal sensory

 summation at the dorsal horn of the spinal cord [78];
however, this proposed model is currently supported
only on findings from transient, experimentally induced
pain in healthy subjects [85, 86], not patients with CH.
Future studies should examine different manual therapy
techniques with varying dosages and include a 1-year
follow-up. Furthermore, future studies examining the
neurophysiological effects of both manipulation and
mobilization will be important for determining why
there may or may not be a difference in clinical effects
between these two treatments.
Conclusion
The results of the current study demonstrated that pa-
tients with CH who received cervical and thoracic ma-
nipulation experienced significantly greater reductions in
headache intensity, disability, headache frequency, head-
ache duration, and medication intake as compared to
the group that received mobilization and exercise; fur-
thermore, the effects were maintained at 3 months
follow-up. Future studies should examine the effective-
ness of different types and dosages of manipulation and
include a long-term follow-up.
