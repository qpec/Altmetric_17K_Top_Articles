Global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment 
of 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and 
metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990–2016: a systematic 
analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016
GBD 2016 Risk Factors Collaborators*
Summary
Background The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) provides a 
comprehensive assessment of risk factor exposure and attributable burden of disease. By providing estimates over a 
long time series, this study can monitor risk exposure trends critical to health surveillance and inform policy debates 
on the importance of addressing risks in context.
Methods We used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of GBD to estimate 
levels and trends in exposure, attributable deaths, and attributable disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), by age group, 
sex, year, and location for 84 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks 
from 1990 to 2016. This study included 481 risk-outcome pairs that met the GBD study criteria for convincing or 
probable evidence of causation. We extracted relative risk (RR) and exposure estimates from 22 717 randomised 
controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources, according 
to the GBD 2016 source counting methods. Using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk exposure 
level (TMREL), we estimated the portion of deaths and DALYs that could be attributed to a given risk. Finally, we 
explored four drivers of trends in attributable burden: population growth, population ageing, trends in risk exposure, 
and all other factors combined.
Findings Since 1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not change significantly for four risks, and 
decreased significantly for 31 risks. Among risks that are leading causes of burden of disease, child growth failure and 
household air pollution showed the most significant declines, while metabolic risks, such as body-mass index and high 
fasting plasma glucose, showed significant increases. In 2016, at Level 3 of the hierarchy, the three leading risk factors 
in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for men were smoking (124·1 million DALYs [95% UI 111·2 million to 
137·0 million]), high systolic blood pressure (122·2 million DALYs [110·3 million to 133·3 million], and low birthweight 
and short gestation (83·0 million DALYs [78·3 million to 87·7 million]), and for women, were high systolic blood 
pressure (89·9 million DALYs [80·9 million to 98·2 million]), high body-mass index (64·8 million DALYs [44·4 million 
to 87·6 million]), and high fasting plasma glucose (63·8 million DALYs [53·2 million to 76·3 million]). In 2016 in 
113 countries, the leading risk factor in terms of attributable DALYs was a metabolic risk factor. Smoking remained 
among the leading five risk factors for DALYs for 109 countries, while low birthweight and short gestation was the 
leading risk factor for DALYs in 38 countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In terms of important 
drivers of change in trends of burden attributable to risk factors, between 2006 and 2016 exposure to risks explains an 
9·3% (6·9–11·6) decline in deaths and a 10·8% (8·3–13·1) decrease in DALYs at the global level, while population 
ageing accounts for 14·9% (12·7–17·5) of deaths and 6·2% (3·9–8·7) of DALYs, and population growth for 12·4% 
(10·1–14·9) of deaths and 12·4% (10·1–14·9) of DALYs. The largest contribution of trends in risk exposure to disease 
burden is seen between ages 1 year and 4 years, where a decline of 27·3% (24·9–29·7) of the change in DALYs between 
2006 and 2016 can be attributed to declines in exposure to risks.
Interpretation Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome 
pair provide insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to risks and how modification of risk exposure 
has contributed to health trends. Metabolic risks warrant particular policy attention, due to their large contribution to 
global disease burden, increasing trends, and variable patterns across countries at the same level of development. 
GBD 2016 findings show that, while it has huge potential to improve health, risk modification has played a relatively 
small part in the past decade.

Introduction
A core premise of public health is that prevention can 
be a powerful instrument for improving human health, 
one that is often cost-effective and minimises harm 
to individuals from ill health. The core objectives 
of prevention include the reduction or modification of 
exposure to risks including metabolic, behavioural, 
environmental, and occupational factors. Quantifying 
risks to health and thus the targets of many public health 
actions is an essential prerequisite for effective public 
health. The evidence on the relation between risk 
exposure and health is constantly evolving: new 
information about the relative risks (RRs) associated with 
different risks for different outcomes continues to 
emerge from cohort studies, randomised trials, and case-
control studies. These studies can establish evidence for 
new risks or risk-outcome pairs or reduce the strength of 
evidence for existing risks. New data are also regularly 
collected on the levels of exposure in different populations 
and in different settings. Regularly updated monitoring 
of the evidence base on risk factors is crucial for public 
health and for individual risk modification through 
primary care and self-management.
Several studies explore risk-attributable burden for 
individual risks1–3 at the global, regional, or national level. 
Other studies provide assessments of exposure for selected 
risks. However, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, 
and Risk Factors Study (GBD) comparative risk assessment 
(CRA) is the only comprehensive and comparable 
approach to risk factor quantification. The most recent of 
these assessments was GBD 2015.4–6 With each cycle of 
GBD, scientific discussions have emerged on various 
dimensions of risk quantification that have led to 
improvements and modifications of GBD. Many of these 
are focused on the strength of evidence supporting a causal 
connection for specific risk-outcome pairs, while others 
relate to measurement challenges.7–9 Further, new risk 
factors have been added for important health conditions 
included in GBD, such as neonatal outcomes and 
Alzheimer’s dementia,10 which have previously not had 
associated risk factors. The recent trials on blood pressure 
control at lower levels of systolic blood pressure, including 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 
2016 (GBD 2016) remains the most comprehensive effort to 
conduct a population-level comparative risk assessment across 
countries and risks. Other sources of population-level estimates 
of risk include WHO and UNICEF reports as well as independent 
scientific publications. Notable differences in methods and 
definitions produce variation in results, although in several 
cases there is general agreement in regional or global patterns.
The GBD study remains the only peer-reviewed, comprehensive, 
and annual assessment of risk factor burden by age, sex, cause, 
and location for a long time series that complies with the 
Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates 
Reporting (GATHER).
Added value of this study
This study builds upon GBD 2015 and provides several important 
improvements as well as the quantification of five new risks. 
The innovations and improvements from last year can be 
summarised as follows. Across all risk factors, there were 
7155 additional data sources, according to the GBD 2016 source 
counting methods. For diet, we included data for dietary recall, 
household budget, and food frequency questionnaires. We also 
incorporated sales data from 170 countries as well as national 
accounting of food available to populations in a given year. In 
GBD 2016, we are producing estimates for the following 
five new risks: smokeless tobacco, low birthweight and short 
gestation, low birthweight for gestation, short gestation for 
birthweight, and diet low in legumes. We also extended the high 
body-mass index (BMI) analysis to include childhood obesity. We 
have also added 93 new risk-outcome pairs. Major revisions to 
the estimation of the following risk factors were undertaken for 
GBD 2016. For second-hand  smoke, we changed the estimation 
method to ensure consistency with the estimates for smoking 
prevalence. For alcohol, we estimated new relative risks (RRs) for 
all outcomes, we incorporated more data for exposure and new 
adjustments for tourism and unrecorded consumption, and we 
redefined the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (TMREL). 
For diet, we estimated the disease burden of dietary risks based 
on the absolute level of intake rather than the intake 
standardised to 2000 kcal per day. We developed an ensemble 
model of different parametric distributions to generate better 
fits to the distributions of continuous risk factors. Mediation 
evidence was reviewed and updated based on an analysis of 
ten pooled cohorts. We have expanded the analysis of 
geographic and temporal trends in risk exposure and burden by 
development, using the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), and 
have also explored where countries are in the risk transition. We 
also improved and modified our decomposition methods so that 
the results shown are additive and can be aggregated to explain 
trends in all-cause and cause-specific mortality, as well as trends 
across age groups. The decomposition analysis has been 
extended to examine how risk factors have contributed to trends 
in all-cause mortality by age and sex as well as by cause.
Implications of all the available evidence
Increasingly detailed understanding of the trends in risk 
exposure and the RRs for each risk-outcome pair provides 
insights into both the magnitude of health loss attributable to 
risks and how modification of risk exposure has contributed to 
health trends. This analysis shows a mismatch between the 
potential for risk modification to improve health and the 
relatively modest role that risk modification has played in the 
past generation in improving global health.

the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT)11 
and Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 (HOPE-3) 
trial,12 have also brought attention to the difference between 
a population health perspective on the quantification of 
risks and the clinical question of risk reversibility. The 
CRA framework provides an important insight into the 
role of different risks in contributing to levels of population 
health but does not necessarily provide all the information 
necessary to guide individual clinical decision making.
The GBD 2016 CRA includes 84 risk factors and an 
associated 481 risk-outcome pairs. In addition to new 
data and updated methods, we have included five new 
risks in the GBD 2016 CRA. The study was undertaken 
for 195 countries and territories and provides estimates 
of exposure and attributable deaths and disability-
adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 1990 through to 2016. We 
explored how risks change with development, measured 
by the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), and also 
decomposed changes in deaths and DALYs into the 
contributions of population ageing, population growth, 
trends in risk exposure, and all other factors combined. 
As with previous iterations of GBD, the GBD 2016 CRA 
results presented here supersede all previously published 
GBD CRA estimates.
Methods
Overview
The CRA conceptual framework was developed by Murray 
and Lopez,13 who established a causal web of hierarchically 
organised risks or causes that contribute to health 
outcomes (method appendix; appendix 1 p 432), which 
allows quantification of risks or causes at any level in the 
framework. In GBD 2016, as in previous iterations of 
GBD, we evaluated a set of behavioural, environmental, 
and occupational, and metabolic risks, where risk-
outcome pairs were included based on evidence rules 
(appendix 1 p 344). These risks were organised into five 
hierarchical levels as described in appendix 1 (p 374). At 
Level 0, the GBD 2016 provides estimates for all risk 
factors 
combined, 
at 
Level 
1 
the 
GBD 
2016 
provides estimates for three groups: environmental and 
occupational, metabolic, and behavioral risk factors. At 
Level 2, there are 17 risks, at Level 3 there are 50 risks, and 
at Level 4 there are 67 risks, for a total of 84 risks or 
clusters of risks. To date, we have not quantified the 
contribution 
of 
other 
classes 
of 
risk 
factors 
(appendix 1 p 376); however, using an analysis of the 
relation between risk exposures and socio-demographic 
development, measured with the use of SDI, we provide 
some insights into the potential magnitude of distal 
social, cultural, and economic factors.
Two types of risk assessment are possible within the 
CRA framework: attributable burden and avoidable 
burden.13 Attributable burden is the reduction in current 
disease burden that would have been possible if past 
population exposure had shifted to an alternative or 
counterfactual distribution of risk exposure. Avoidable 
burden is the potential reduction in future disease burden 
that could be achieved by changing the current distribution 
of exposure to a counterfactual distribution of exposure. 
Murray and Lopez13 identified four types of counterfactual 
exposure distributions: theoretical, plausible, feasible, and 
cost-effective minimum risk. In GBD studies, to date and 
in this study, we focus on attributable burden using the 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level, which is the 
distribution of risk comprising the levels of exposure that 
minimise risk for each individual in the population.
Overall, this analysis follows the CRA methods used in 
GBD 2015.4 The methods described in this study provide 
a high-level overview of the analytical logic, focusing on 
areas of notable change from the methods used in GBD 
2015, with details provided in appendix 1 (p 10). This 
study complies with the Guidelines for Accurate and 
Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER) 
statement14 (appendix 1 p 377).
Geographical units of analysis and years for estimation
In GBD 2016, locations are arranged as a set of hierarchical 
categories: seven super-regions, 21 regions nested within 
the seven super-regions, and 195 countries and territories 
nested in the 21 regions. Additionally, we present estimates 
at the subnational level for five countries with a population 
greater than 200 million in 2016: Brazil, China, India, 
Indonesia, and the USA. We produced a complete set of 
age-specific, sex-specific, cause-specific, and location-
specific estimates of risk factor exposure and attributable 
burden for 1990–2016 for all included risk factors.
Attributable burden estimation
Four key components are included in estimation of the 
burden attributable to a given risk factor: the metric of 
burden being assessed (number of deaths, years of life lost 
[YLLs], years lived with disability [YLDs], or DALYs [the 
sum of YLLs and YLDs]), the exposure levels for a risk 
factor, the relative risk of a given outcome due to exposure, 
and the counterfactual level of risk factor exposure. 
Estimates of attributable DALYs for a risk-outcome pair are 
equal to DALYs for the outcome multiplied by the 
population attributable fraction (PAF) for the risk-outcome 
pair for a given age, sex, location, and year. A similar logic 
applies for estimation of attributable deaths, YLLs, or 
YLDs. Risks are categorised on the basis of how exposure 
was measured: dichotomous, polytomous, or continuous. 
The PAF represents the proportion of outcome that would 
be reduced in a given year if the exposure to a risk factor in 
the past were reduced to the counterfactual level of the 
theoretical minimum risk exposure level (supplementary 
results, appendix 2 p 1).
Causal evidence for risk-outcome pairs
In this study, as in GBD 2015, we have included risk-
outcome pairs that we have assessed as meeting the 
World Cancer Research Fund grades of convincing or 
probable evidence (see appendix 1 p 10 for definitions of 
See Online for appendix 1
See Online for appendix 2

these grades).15 Table 1 provides a summary of the 
evidence supporting a causal relation between a risk and 
an outcome for each pair included in GBD 2016. For 
each risk-outcome pair, we used recent systematic 
reviews to identify independent prospective studies 
(randomised 
controlled 
trials, 
non-randomised 
interventions, and cohorts) that evaluated the putative 
relationship. For risk-outcome pairs with fewer than five 
prospective studies, we evaluated evidence from case-
control studies as well (appendix 1 p 344). Table 1 
summarises the evidence using multiple dimensions, 
which supports our assessment that each included risk-
outcome pair meets the criteria of convincing or 
probable evidence (appendix 1 p 10 contains a 
justification of the criteria presented to support 
causality). In this summary of evidence, we have focused 
on randomised controlled trials and prospective 
observational studies, along with supporting evidence, 
like dose–response relationships and biologically 
plausible mechanisms.
Estimation process
Information about the data sources, estimation methods, 
computational tools, and statistical analysis used in the 
derivation of our estimates are provided in appendix 1 
(p 10). The analytical steps for estimation of burden 
attributable to single or clusters of risk-outcome pairs are 
summarised in appendix 1 (p 10). Table 2 provides 
definitions of exposure for each risk factor, the theoretical 
minimum risk exposure level (TMREL) used, and metrics 
of data availability. For each risk, we estimated effect size 
as a function of age and sex and exposure level, mean 
exposure, the distribution of exposure across individuals, 
and the TMREL. The approach taken is largely similar to 
GBD 2015 for each quantity for each risk. Some 
methodological improv 
ements have been implemented 
and new data sources incorporated. Appendix 1 (p 34) 
provides details of each step by risk. Citation information 
for the data sources used for relative risks are provided in 
searchable form through an online source tool.
All point estimates are reported with 95% uncertainty 
intervals (UIs). UIs include uncertainty from each 
relevant component, consisting of exposure, relative 
risks, TMREL, and burden rates. Where percentage 
change is reported (with 95% UIs), we computed it on 
the basis of the point estimates being compared.
In GBD 2015, we produced a summary measure of 
exposure for each risk, called the summary exposure 
value (SEV), which is a metric that captures risk-weighted 
exposure for a population, or risk-weighted prevalence of 
an exposure. The scale for SEV spans from 0% to 100%, 
such that an SEV of 0% reflects no risk exposure in a 
population and 100% indicates that an entire population 
is exposure to the maximum possible level for that risk. 
In GBD 2016, we show estimates of SEVs for each risk 
factor and provide details on how SEVs are computed for 
categorical and continuous risks in appendix 1 (p 10).
Fitting a distribution to exposure data
The most informative data describing the distribution of 
risk factors within a population come from individual-level 
data; additional sources of data include reported means 
and variances. In cases when a risk factor also defines a 
disease, such as haemoglobin level and anaemia, the 
prevalence of disease is also frequently reported. To model 
the distribution of any particular risk factor, we seek a 
family of probability density functions (PDFs), a fitting 
method, and a model selection criterion. To make use of 
the most data describing most populations, we used the 
method of moments (MoM); the first two empirical 
moments from a population, the mean and variance, were 
used to determine the PDF describing the distribution of 
risk within any population, where exceptions to this rule 
are justified by context. We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
test to measure the goodness of fit (GoF), but in some 
cases, the GoF was based on the prediction error for the 
prevalence of disease.
We used an ensemble technique in which a model 
selection algorithm is used to choose the best model for 
each risk factor.16 We drew the initial set of candidate 
models from commonly used PDF families. We fitted each 
PDF candidate family to each dataset using the MoM, and 
used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test17 as the measure of GoF. 
Preliminary analysis showed that the GoF ranking of PDF 
families varied across datasets for any particular risk factor 
and that combining the predictions of differently fitted 
PDF families could dramatically improve the GoF for each 
dataset. Therefore, we developed a new model for prediction 
using the ensemble of candidate models, which is a 
weighted linear combination of all candidate models, {f}, 
where a set of weights {w} is chosen such that it is the sum 
of the weights equals to one and the values of the weights 
were determined by a second GoF criterion with its own 
validation process. Because of basic differences among risk 
factors, their distributions, and the risk attribution process, 
the model selection process was often slightly different for 
each risk factor. The details can be summarised by (1) the 
summary statistics for each dataset; (2) a table showing the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic for each candidate model 
and URD; (3) the criterion used for determining the overall 
GoF; (4) summary results of the validation process; and (5) 
the weights defining the final ensemble model for each 
dataset.
New risks and risks with significant changes in the 
estimation methods compared with GBD 2015
We took several steps to improve the estimation of alcohol 
use as a risk factor. First, on the exposure side, we added 
26 survey series, which contributed 12 195 datapoints in 
our models. Second, we developed and implemented a 
method that adjusts total consumption for tourism and 
unrecorded consumption for each location-year. Third, 
we calculated the TMREL. We chose TMREL as being the 
exposure that minimises an individual’s risk of suffering 
burden from any given cause related to alcohol

reporting a RR, hazard ratio, or odds ratio for any risk-
outcome pairs studied in GBD 2016 and then modelled a 
dose-response relationship using DisMod ordinary 
differential equations (ODE).18 Fifth, we estimated injury 
PAFs from cohort studies and adjusted them to account 
for victims.

If multiple reports existed from the same study, we counted them as one study. We only assessed the dose–response relationship for continuous risks. To evaluate the magnitude of the effect size for continuous 
risks, we evaluated the relative risk comparing the 75th percentile with the 25th percentile of the exposure distribution at the global level. RCT=randomised controlled trial. RR=relative risk. *Prospective cohort 
studies or non-randomised interventions. †Case-control studies were included for those risk-outcome pairs where the sum of RCT and prospective observational studies included was less than five (where 
applicable). ‡Whether or not any biological or mechanistic pathway exists that could potentially explain the relationship of the risk-outcome pair. §Whether or not the risk is associated with another outcome 
from the same category and whether or not any evidence exists that it can cause the current outcome through the same pathway.

We made several improvements in the process of 
estimating the burden of disease attributable to dietary 
risks. To improve the quality and coverage of our dietary 
estimates, we systematically searched literature for 
nationally or subnationally representative studies pro-
viding information on consumption of each dietary factor. 
We also made a systematic effort to obtain individual-level 
data for consumption of dietary factors; re-extracted data 
from all available sources; and standardised the definition 
of dietary factors across different sources. To capture 
recent trends in consumption, we used data on sales of 
different fresh and packaged foods to inform our estimates. 
To address the concerns over within-person variation in 
intake, we estimated usual intake of each dietary factor and 
used that to estimate the attributable disease burden. To 
make the current and optimal levels of intake more 
comparable, we used absolute intake of each dietary factor 
(rather than intake standardised to 2000 kcal per day). For 
more detail, see appendix 1 (p 117).
There were two substantial changes in the estimation of 
second-hand  smoke compared with GBD 2015. First, we 
estimated the proportion of a population exposed to second-
hand  smoke using information about household 
composition and smoking status from household surveys 
and censuses, rather than using questions that ask directly 
about exposure to second-hand  smoke in surveys. Second, 
we modelled exposure using spatiotemporal Gaussian 
process regression (ST-GPR), borrowing strength across 
sexes and all ages, whereas in GBD 2015 we ran a DisMod 
model separately by sex and age. Further, we found 
significant evidence of associations between second-hand 
 
smoke exposure and two additional outcomes: breast cancer 
and diabetes, which were added to the list of risk-outcome 
pairs for second-hand  smoke. More details on the esti-
mation approach are presented in appendix 1 (p 98).
For the first time in the GBD study, we estimated 
exposure to and burden attributable to smokeless 
tobacco, defined as current use of any smokeless tobacco 
product. RR estimates were derived from prospective 
cohort studies and case-control studies and vary 
depending on the type of product used. Based on 
available evidence, for chewing tobacco RRs were 
significantly higher than one for oral cancer and 
oesophageal cancer, while for snus or snuff we did not 
find sufficient evidence of a RR greater than one for any 
health outcome. Additional details on the estimation 
methods and RRs are presented in appendix 1 (p 11, p 181).
Low birthweight for gestation and short gestation for 
birthweight are included as new risk factors for GBD 2016. 
The estimation has been parameterised to be polytomous 
by 500 g and 2 week categories. Low birthweight and 
gestational age are highly correlated risks and they are 
estimated in a completely interdependent manner. For 
each univariate analysis, identification of TMREL and 
calculation of PAFs is contingent on the other dimension. 
In other words, we found the lowest risk birthweight 
category for each 2 week gestational age band and, 
correspondingly, the lowest risk gestational age for each 
500 g birthweight band. RRs were then estimated for each 
500 g per 2 week bin. Exposure for each bin was estimated 
in three steps. First, we estimated by generating ensemble 
distribution estimates using modelled mean and 
categorical prevalence estimates for each of birthweight 
(mean, % <2500 g) and gestational age (mean, % <37 weeks, 
% <28 weeks) for each location, year, and sex. Second, we 
evaluated all microdata where both gestational age and 
birthweight were available and found a high degree of 
consistency in the correlation between them. Third, we 
took the pooled correlation coefficient from step 2 
combined with univariate ensemble distributions from 
step 1 and used a copula linking function to simulate the 
joint distribution which was then summarised into each 
500 g per 2 week category. Joint PAF calculation used a 
TMREL defined as the lowest overall risk of the entire 
matrix of birthweight and gestational age (see appendix 1 
p 77 for more details).

Mediation
In GBD 2016, we updated our approach for estimation of 
the joint effects of combinations of risk factors 
(appendix 1 p 23). Using individual-level data from 
prospective cohort studies, we estimated the proportion 
of the effect of behavioural risks on cardiometabolic 
outcomes mediated through metabolic risk factors. We 
also estimated the proportion of the effect of each 
metabolic risk factor on cardiometabolic outcomes 
mediated through other metabolic risks. For each 
mediation pathway, we only included the mediators for 
which sufficient evidence existed for their causal 
relationship with the disease endpoint.
Explaining the drivers of trends in deaths and DALYs
As in GBD 2015, we undertook a decomposition analysis 
of changes in DALYs over the time period into four main 
components, namely, changes in DALYs due to changes 
in: (1) population growth; (2) population age structure; 
(3) exposure to all risks for a disease; and (4) all other 
factors combined, approximated as the risk-deleted death 
and DALY rates. Risk-deleted rates refers to death and 
DALY rates that would be observed if we removed all risk 
factors included in GBD 2016, estimated as DALY rates 
multiplied by one minus the PAF for the set of risks. We 
used methods developed by Das Gupta,19 but as 
the methods presented there do not result in the 
decomposition results being linear aggregates over time 
or risk, we adapted these methods further in GBD 2016. 
Our decomposition analysis was undertaken for each 
5 year time period, at the all-risk level, taking into account 
risk mediation at the most detailed cause level. The 
contribution of changes in exposure for the individual 
risks was scaled to the all-risk effect at the most detailed 
outcome level. The contribution of risk exposures over 
longer time periods—eg, 2000–16—or at higher cause 
aggregates—eg, all cause—were calculated as the linear 
aggregate of the effect of individual risks at the most 
detailed cause level and time period.
Risk transition with development
We explored how exposure to risks varies across levels of 
development using the SDI, a composite indicator of 
development status constructed for GBD 2015 whose 
components are strongly correlated with health outcomes. 
It is the geometric mean of 0 to 1 for indices of total 
fertility rate, mean education for those aged 15 years and 
older, and lag-distributed income per capita. More details 
on the estimation of SDI can be found in appendix 1 
(p 32).
Role of the funding source

data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or 
writing of the report. The authors had full access to all 
data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
Global exposure to risks
From 1990 to 2016, trends in SEVs varied across the set of 
risk factors included in GBD 2016. Of note, SEVs decreased 
by more than 40% for three risks: diet high in transfatty 
acids (51·3% [95% UI 34·1–70·1]), household air pollution 
from solid fuels (43·1% [40·7–45·6]), and unsafe sanitation 
(40·3% [35·5–44·7]; table 3, appendix 2 p 1399). During 
the same period, SEVs increased by more than 40% for 
high body-mass index (BMI; 60·2% [45·1–79·1]), diet high 
in sugar-sweetened beverages (44·7% [36·1–52·7]), occu-
pational exposure to diesel engine exhaust (41·8% 
[41·3–42·2]), and occupational exposure to trichloro-
ethylene (40·6% [40·2–41·1]).
Across countries there is substantial variation in risk 
exposure by level of SDI. Some risk factors, such as high 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and high systolic blood 
pressure, show similar SEVs across levels of SDI, while 
others, including household air pollution and unsafe 
water source, show marked trends with sociodemographic 
development. Figure 1 shows the relationship between 
SEVs and SDI for the leading three metabolic, behavioural, 
and environmental and occupational risk factors and how 
that changed between 1990 and 2016. Within leading 
metabolic risks (high BMI, high FPG, and high systolic 
blood pressure [SBP]), risk-weighted exposure shows an 
increasing trend with increasing SDI for only high BMI. 
Overall, the SEV for high BMI has increased during the 
time period. Looking at the leading three environmental 
risk factors (ambient air pollution, household air pollution, 
and unsafe water), figure 2 shows an inverse relationship 
with SDI for household air pollution and unsafe water, 
with SEVs approaching zero at high levels of SDI, while 
the relationship is less consistent with ambient air 
pollution. Finally, the relationship between SDI and the 
leading behavioural risk factors is more heterogeneous, 
with smoking and alcohol use having a positive correlation 
with SDI, and short gestation for birthweight having a 
negative correlation with SDI.
Global attributable burden for all risk factors combined 
and their overlap
Globally, 59·9% (58·4–61·3) of deaths and 45·2% 
(43·2–47·3) of DALYs could be attributed to the risk factors 
assessed in GBD 2016. For deaths, non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) show the largest proportion attributable 
to measured risk factors, at 64·4% (62·6–66·2), with 
communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional 
(CMNN) causes at 57·9% (55·4–61·0), and injuries at 
25·8% (23·7–27·8). The picture was different for DALYs, 
however, where we observed that 58·2% (56·4–60·3) of 
DALYs in CMNN causes are attributable to risk factors, 
compared with 43·5% (40·7–46·7) in NCDs and 21·0% 
(19·3–22·7) for injuries. Leading causes of DALYs in 
CMNN causes, such as diarrhoea and lower respiratory 
infections (LRI), also showed more than 80% of DALYs can 
be attributed to risk factors (appendix 2 p 1).

Within NCDs, three of the leading causes of deaths 
and DALYs, ischaemic heart disease (IHD; 93·3% 
[90·3–95·7] of deaths and 94·4% [92·6–95·8] of DALYs), 
haemorrhagic stroke (88·2% [84·3–91·8] of deaths and 
89·5% [87·1–91·6] of DALYS), and chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disorder (COPD; 76·6% [69·9–82·9] of deaths 
and 73·8% [67·4–80·2] DALYs) all have high proportions 
attributable to measured risk factors. Lung cancer, a leading 
cause of death but not DALYs, also has a large proportion of 
total deaths and DALYs attributed to measured risk factors 
(84·1% [78·9–88·3] and 83·2% [78·0–87·6] respectively), 
while for Alzheimer’s disease only 21·4% (11·2–34·0) of 
total deaths and 22·3% (11·8–35·1) of DALYs can be 
attributed to measured risk factors. For leading causes of 
DALYs that do not cause death, such as low back pain and 
sense organ diseases, less than a third of their total burden 
can be attributable to measured risk factors (23·0% 
[20·1–25·9] for low back and neck pain and 13·8% [12·4–
15·4] for sense organ diseases). Across all cancers, 42·1% 
(38·9–45·3) of deaths and 39·8% (36·8–42·8) of DALYs are 
attributable to measured risk factors; however, there is a 
very large range within cancers, from cervical cancer at 
100% of deaths attributable to risk factors and lung cancer 
at 84·08% (78·9–88·3) of deaths attributable to risk factors 
to several cancers at nearly zero, such as brain cancer.
Across types of risk factors, behavioural risk factors 
accounted for 32·7% (30·7–34·8) of attributable DALYs, 
followed by metabolic risk factors at 16·8% (15·7–18·0), 
and environmental and occupational at 13·1% (12·1–14·2). 
This pattern was seen in middle SDI, middle-high SDI, 
and high SDI locations, while in low SDI and low-middle 
SDI locations environmental risk factors accounted for a 
larger proportion of attributable DALYs than metabolic 
risk factors. This is a pattern that has persisted since 1990; 
notably, however, the importance of metabolic risk factors 
is growing steadily in low SDI and low-middle SDI 
locations, while that of environmental and occupational 
risks has decreased during this time period. More detail 
can be found in appendix 2 (p 1399).
Levels and trends in the burden attributable to risk factors
Table 4 reports all-cause deaths and DALYs attributable to 
all risk factors considered here from 2006 to 2016, 
including detail on attributable deaths and DALYs by 
risk-outcome pair (appendix 2 p 1865) contains results 
for every location. Globally, 32·8 million (31·9 million to 
33·7 million) deaths were attributable to all risk factors 
in 2016, a significant increase since 2006 of 2·9% 
(1·1–4·8); however, age-standardised attributable death 
rate declined from 2006 to 2016 by 18·7% (17·3–20·0). By 
contrast, total DALYs attributable to all risks decreased by 
8·6% (6·6–10·7) since 2006, and age-standardised DALY 
rate attributable to all risks decreased by 21·7% 
(20·0–23·3). Among Level 1 risks, the largest decreases 
in age-standardised death rates were observed for 
environmental 
and 
occupational 
risks 
(24·3% 
[22·5–26·0]), followed by behavioural risks (21·5% 
[19·8–23·3]), and metabolic risks (11·9% [9·9–13·5]). 
Similarly, there were significant decreases in age-
standardised DALY rates for all three Level 1 risk factors, 
although the magnitude of decrease was larger for DALY 
rates than death rates. In the year 2016, behavioural risk 
factors accounted for the largest number of deaths 
(21·8 million [20·5 million to 23·3 million]) and DALYs 
(781·1 million [737·1 million to 830·1 million]). While 
there were decreases in both deaths and DALYs 
attributable to behavioural risk factors since 2006, these 
decreases were significant for deaths (2·5% [0·1–4·9])

and DALYs (14·3% [11·8–16·6]). There was a significant, 
17·9% (15·7–20·6), increase in number of deaths 
attributable to metabolic risk factors, from 14·8 million 
deaths (14·0 million to 15·7 million) in 2006 to 
17·5 million deaths (16·4 million to 18·5 million) in 
2016, with similar increases observed for DALYs. 
Environmental and occupational risk factors accounted 
for the fewest number of deaths and DALYs, and there 
was a significant decline in both measures since 2006.
Global patterns of burden attributable to risk factors 
across quintiles of SDI
Figure 2 shows that in 2016, the leading Level 2 risk factors 
in terms of attributable DALYs at the global level for both 
sexes combined were malnutrition (11·5% [10·8–12·3] of 
DALYs), diet (9·6% [8·2–11·1] of DALYs), high blood 
pressure (8·9% [7·9–9·9] of DALYs), tobacco (7·4% 
[6·7–8·3] of DALYs), and air pollution (6·8% [6·1–7·6] of 
DALYs). The list at this level of aggregation is similar for

both sexes combined, with a notable difference being that 
alcohol and drug use is the fifth-leading risk factor for men, 
with 7·9% (7·2–8·6) of DALYs, but is at eleventh place for 
women (2·6% [2·3–2·9] of DALYs). More detail can be 
found in appendix 2 (p 1399). The patterns of risks vary by 
development, as seen across the panels of figure 3. At the 
lowest level of SDI, the leading risk is malnutrition with 
25·0% (23·2–26·6) of DALYs, followed by air pollution 
(8·0% [7·1–9·0] of DALYs), unsafe water, sanitation, and 
handwashing (7·8% [6·6–9·4] of DALYs), and unsafe sex 
(4·7% [4·3–5·2] of DALYs). While malnutrition remains 
the leading risk factor at the low-middle level of SDI, diet 
(7·8% [6·8–9·0] of DALYs), high systolic blood pressure 
(7·2% [6·8–8·1] of DALYs), and tobacco use (5·9% [5·3–6·6] 
of DALYs) get included among the leading five causes as 
well. At the middle SDI level, diet is among the leading five 
risks with 12·5% (10·6–14·6) of DALYs while high systolic 
blood pressure and tobacco follow in importance. At the top 
three levels of SDI, high BMI increases in importance and 
makes it to the leading five risks, with 7·2% (4·7–10·0) of 
DALYs in middle SDI locations, with 9·8% (6·5–13·2) of 
DALYs in high-middle SDI locations, and 8·7% (5·9–11·7) 
of DALYs in high SDI locations. The panels in figure 3 
clearly show the risk transition across levels of development.
Changes in leading risk factors in 1990, 2006, and 2016
Figure 3 shows the leading 30 risk factors at Level 3 of the 
hierarchy and the median change in DALYs between 1990, 
2006, and 2016. In terms of rates, among the top ten leading 
risks in 1990, child growth failure, unsafe sanitation, and 
unsafe water have experienced the largest declines over the 
period of 1990–2016. While these three risks have remained 
in the top 30 in 2016 for men, their ranks have fallen by 
several places to 9th (child growth failure), 21st (unsafe 
sanitation), and 16th (unsafe water). For women, their 
ranks have fallen to 5th (child growth failure), 16th (unsafe 
sanitation), and 13th (unsafe water). Between 1990 and 
2006, median age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 
46·7% (42·1–51·1) for men and 49·0% (45·0–53·0) for 
women, and in the most recent period child growth failure 
demonstrated further declines by 43·8% (36·9–49·8) for 
men and 48·7% (42·3–54·6) for women.
The risk factor of low birthweight for gestation and 
short gestation for birthweight remains among the 
leading risks (second position in 1990 for both sexes; 
third position in 2016 for men and fourth position for 
women), despite declines in both the number of DALYs 
and the age-standardised DALY rates since 1990. Smoking 
is another risk where there has been a consistent decline 
since 1990 in both SEVs and age-standardised DALY 
rates, yet it has consistently been ranked among the 
leading three risk factors for men in DALYs since 1990.
The trend in unsafe sex coincides with the HIV
/AIDS 
epidemic. Figure 3 shows that unsafe sex experienced 
large increases between 1990 and 2006, by 198·8% 
(170·45–228·2) for men and 204·0% (170·0–236·4) for 
women, resulting in a higher rank in 2006, followed by 
declines of 43·8% (41·7–45·7) for men and 46·7% 
(44·1–49·0) for women since 2006 resulting in a lower rank 
in 2016. On the other hand, drug use follows a different 
trend, and increased for men by 17·6% (13·0–25·5) 
between 1990 and 2006 and resulted in a higher rank in 
2006, and decreased 5·7% (2·2–9·0) since 2006. Despite 
declines, drug use rose from the 25th leading risk to the 
18th leading risk for men between 1990 and 2016.
Air pollution, both household air pollution and ambient 
particulate matter, were among the leading ten risk factors 
for men and women in 1990 and have remained important 
in 2016. The median percent change in age-standardised 
DALY rates showed important declines in both time 
periods for men and women. Specifically, in the most 
recent time period household air pollution declined by 
38·3% (35·3–41·4) for men and 41·1% (37·8–44·2) for 
women, and ambient air pollution decreased by 14·2% 
(11·5–17·1) for men and 21·3% (17·8–24·5) for women, in 
terms of median age-standardised DALY rates.
The metabolic risk factors have increased in both rank 
and in the absolute number of DALYs between 1990 and 
2016 for both men and women. High blood pressure was 
the fourth-leading risk factor for both men and women in 
1990 and had risen to be the second leading risk factor for 
men and the leading risk factor for women by 2016. In 
terms of the number of DALYs, men showed an increase 
of 16·2% (13·1–19·4) since 2006, while for women the 
increase was less steep at 7·7% (4·5–11·7). In terms of the 
median change in age-standardised DALY rates since 
2006, both sexes showed a decline, 10·5% (8·2–12·7) for 
men and 16·8% (13·7–19·3) for women. Other leading 
metabolic risk factors, including high BMI, high FPG, 
and high total cholesterol, exhibited similar trends to high 
blood pressure over this time period. All four of these 
metabolic risk factors are within the leading ten risk 
factors globally for men and women in 2016.
Among the leading risk factors in terms of DALYs, high 
BMI and high FPG have the fastest increases in SEVs with 
annualised rates of change of 1·7% (1·5–1·9) and 0·9% 
(0·6–1·3), respectively, since 1990 (figure 4). On the other 
hand, other leading risk factors in 2016 such as smoking 
and household air pollution exhibited significant and fast 
declines in SEVs, with a –1·3% (–1·6 to –1·1) annualised 
rate of change for smoking and –2·3% (–2·5 to –2·2) for 
household air pollution between 1990 and 2016 (figure 4).
Drivers of changes in risk-attributable deaths and DALYs
Figure 5 shows the relative contributions to changes in 
deaths and DALYs of important drivers grouped into four 
Figure 2: DALYs attributable to all Level 2 risk factors apportioned by Level 2 
cause for each risk, both sexes combined, 2016, at the global level (A); for low 
SDI countries (B); for low-middle SDI countries (C); for middle SDI countries 
(D); for middle-high SDI countries (E); and for high SDI countries (F)
DALYs from causes attributable to each risk factor are shown in different colours. 
Cutoffs on the SDI scale for the quintiles were selected based on examining the 
entire distribution of locations between 1980 and 2016. 
DALYs=disability-adjusted life-years. SDI=Socio-demographic Index.

mutually 
exclusive 
categories: 
population 
growth, 
population ageing, trends in exposure to all risk factors 
measured in GBD 2016, and all other factors combined. 
Globally, trends in exposure to all risk factors combined 
would have led to a decrease of deaths by 9·3% (6·9–11·6) 
and DALYs by 10·8% (8·3–13·1). Risk factors play a larger 
part in CMNN causes, where trends in exposure to risks 
would have resulted in a decrease of deaths by 14·9% 
(12·4–17·1) and DALYs by 15·0% (12·7–17·6). Overall, 
population ageing and population growth are both driving 
deaths and DALYs to increase significantly. At the global 
level, across all causes, population growth alone would 
have resulted in 12·4% (10·1–14·9) more deaths and 
12·4% (10·1–14·9) more DALYs, while population ageing 
would have contributed 14·9% (12·7–17·5) more deaths 
and 12·4% (10·1–14·9) more DALYs. The contribution of 
population ageing in NCDs is noteworthy as it is the 
largest driver of trends in NCDs, and accounts for 19·5% 
(17·3–22·0) more deaths and 14·0% (11·6–16·3) more 
DALYs between 2006 and 2016. The residual category, 
which includes improvements in treatment along with 
other factors, accounts for a decrease of 15·3% (12·9–17·7) 
for deaths and 16·5% (14·1–18·8) for DALYs across all 
causes and is particularly large for CMNN causes 
accounting for a 30·0% (27·5–32·4) decline in deaths and 
a 26·8% (24·4–29·2) decline in DALYs since 2006.
Figure 6 shows the contribution of these drivers across 
age groups for DALYs. Across age groups, the contributions 
of the four drivers differ greatly. Changes in risk exposure 
have played a major part in the declines in DALYs younger 
than 5 years, accounting for 26·7% (24·3–29·7) of the 
trend in DALYs in the post-neonatal period and 27·3% 
(24·9–29·7) among ages 1–4 years. Trends in risks account 
for a decline of 8·7% (6·3–11·1) of DALYs in older children 
(ages 5–9 years) and 9·0% (6·5–11·4) of DALYs in young 
adolescents (ages 10–14 years). As expected, population 
ageing is a more significant driver among older age 
groups, accounting for up to 51·4% (49·1–53·9) of the 
change in DALYs since 2006 among the age group 
90–94 years. Finally, the proportion of the change in 
DALYs that is due to all other factors—ie, not explained by 
these three major drivers—also shows large variation 
across age groups, ranging from a decrease of 3·5% 
(1·1–6·0) in the age group 15–19 years to a decrease of 
28·2% (25·8–30·5) in the age group 1–4 years.
Key results for new risks, leading risks, and risks with 
significant changes in GBD 2016
In 2016, for Level 3 risks factors, more DALYs were 
attributable to increased SBP than any other risk factor. 
Increased SBP was the second leading risk factor for men 
and leading risk factor for women globally, accounting for 
89·9 million (80·9 million to 98·2 million) DALYs among 
women and 124·1 million (111·2 million to 138·0 million) 
DALYs among men. IHD was the largest source of DALYs 
attributable to increased SBP, followed by haemorrhagic 
stroke and ischaemic stroke. Since 1990, the SEV for 
increased SBP rose for men (22·9 [21·5–24·6] in 1990 to 
24·6 [23·0–26·6] in 2016, a 7·5% increase [7·0–8·0]), and 
increased for women (24·2 [22·7–25·8] in 1990 to 24·2 
[22·7–25·8] in 2016, a 0·7% increase [0·2–1·2]).
In 2016, 7·1 million (6·5 million to 7·8 million) deaths

Risks are connected by lines between time periods. Behavioural risk factors are 
shown in red, environmental risks in blue, and metabolic risks in green. For the 
time period of 1990 to 2006 and for 2006–16, three measures of change are 
shown: percent change in the number of DALYs, percent change in the all-age 
DALY rate, and percent change in the age-standardised DALY rate. Statistically 
significant increases or decreases are shown in bold (p<0·05). DALYs=disability-

were attributable to tobacco, most of which is attributable to 
smoking tobacco. Smoking-attributable deaths have 
increased by 20·1% (15·3–25·2) since 1990, with most 
deaths occurring in China, India, the USA, and Russia. 
Smoking is the second-leading risk factor for men for 
deaths and leading for DALYs, accounting for 16·3% 
(14·6–17·9) of deaths and 9·5% (8·5–10·7) of DALYs, and 
the sixth for women for deaths and ninth for DALYs, with 
5·8% (5·0–6·7) of deaths and 2·9% (2·5–2·94) of DALYs. 
In 2016, there were 177·3 million (162·3 million to 
194·3 million) smoking-attributable DALYs globally. Overall, 
in 2016 chronic respiratory diseases (30·3% [25·2–36·0]), 
neoplasms (19·2% [16·0–22·8]), and cardiovascular 
diseases (18·0% [16·0–20·0] were the three leading causes 
of smoking-attributable age-standardised DALYs across 
both sexes. For women, the leading cause of DALYs was 
COPD, whereas the leading cause for men was IHD.

to second-hand smoke exposure is bimodal, with peaks in 
the post-neonatal period and again in older age groups. 
Globally 0·9 million (0·7 million to 1·1 million) deaths 
were attributable to second-hand  smoke exposure, of 
which 56 340 (28 951–89 043) occurred among children 
younger than age 10 years.
In estimating the burden attributable to smokeless 
tobacco, we found that the risk varies by the toxicity of the 
type used; there is sufficient evidence that chewing tobacco 
and other products of similar toxicity cause excess risk of 
oral and oesophageal cancer while, at this time, existing 
evidence does not support attributing burden to snus or 
similar smokeless tobacco products. Globally, smoking 
tobacco causes far more burden than smokeless tobacco; 
nonetheless, smokeless tobacco is an important risk factor 
for oral and oesophageal cancer in India, where more than 
half of the 32 141 (24 930–39 243) global deaths attributable 
to smokeless tobacco occur.
Low birthweight and short gestation, new risk factors in 
GBD 2016, were the third-ranked Level 3 risk factor globally 
for all-ages DALYs in 2016, which reflects a 61·6% 
(59·3–64·0) decrease in all-ages DALY rates from 5112·8 
(4934·2–5389·6) DALYs per 100 000 in 1990 to 1960·8 
(1862·0–2060·3) DALYs in 2016. In 1990, this risk factor 
was the second-ranked Level 3 risk factor globally for all-age 
DALYs; most of the decrease from 1990 to 2016 is due to a 
lower mortality burden in the causes attributable to low 
birthweight and short gestation rather than changes in 
exposure itself. Increasing SDI was associated with 
decreasing exposure, but the exposure gradient between 
SDI quintiles was not as large as the differential between 
high and low SDI in attributable burden. Exposure was 
highest in South Asia, eastern sub-Saharan Africa, and 
parts of the western Sahel zone, while attributable burden 
was highest in South Asia and parts of the western Sahel 
zone. The trend in exposure to low birthweight for gestation 
decreased at the global level from 1990 to 2016, reflective of 
the overall decrease in DALYs burden during the same time 
period. The biggest improvements were seen in Colombia, 
Brunei, and Zimbabwe, with broad improvements also 
seen across much of eastern sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2016, high FPG was the third-leading risk factor for 
deaths and the fourth-leading risk factor for DALYs globally 
among Level 3 risk factors, accounting for more than 
5·6 million deaths (4·5 million to 7·0 million) and 
144·1 million DALYs (119·9 million to 171·6 million). Since 
1990, the age-standardised percent of deaths and DALYs 
attributable to high FPG has increased globally from 7·8% 
(6·0–10·1) to 10·5% (8·3–13·1) and 4·4% (3·7–5·3) to 
6·2% (5·3–7·3), respectively. Diabetes was the largest 
source of DALYs attributable to increased FPG, followed by 
ischaemic heart disease and chronic kidney disease. We re-
evaluated epidemiological evidence supporting the causal 
relationship between high FPG and disease endpoints and 
found sufficient evidence to include ten new outcomes for 
high FPG. These new outcomes included glaucoma, 
cataracts, dementia, liver cancer, lung cancer, ovarian 
cancer, breast cancer, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, and 
pancreatic cancer. The new outcomes together contributed 
to 174 352 (37 297–388 039) additional deaths and 2·6 million 
(0·6 million to 5·7 million) additional DALYs beyond the 
causes that were included in GBD 2015.
In 2016, BMI was the fifth-ranked Level 3 risk factor for 
death globally, accounting for more than 4·5 million 
(2·9 million to 6·4 million) deaths and 135·4 million 
(88·6 million to 187·4 million) DALYs. Among Level 3 risk 
factors with more than 10 million attributable DALYs, high 
BMI had the fastest annualised rate of increase in SEV 
since 1990 (appendix 2 p 1399). Despite this significant 
increase in risk exposure, increases in attributable burden 
were attenuated by significant decreases in risk-deleted 
DALY rates, mainly due to reductions in cardiovascular 
disease mortality rates. We find that the burden attributable 
to high BMI increases with increasing development, with 
the lowest rates of disease attributable to high BMI found 
in sub-Saharan Africa, yet development is not the only 
predictor. We conducted a systematic search of health 
outcomes caused by excess bodyweight and added eight 
new causes for GBD 2016, which together contributed to 
442 750 (191 407–796 350) additional deaths beyond the 
causes that were included in GBD 2015. Additionally, we 
included childhood overweight and childhood obesity as 
new risk factors, allowing us to better capture the health 
effects of excess bodyweight across the life course. Within

the CRA framework, the only childhood overweight and 
obesity outcome eligible for inclusion was asthma. We 
found that 10·4% (3·1–21·2) of asthma can be attributed to 
childhood excess bodyweight globally, a total of 1128 
(311–2354) deaths and 642 532·1 (180 916·3 to 1 456 342·7) 
DALYs. While childhood burden is much smaller com-
pared with adult burden, estimating exposure for children 
is crucially important in view of the well described effects of 
childhood overweight and obesity on adult health outcomes.
Air pollution was ranked sixth in terms of attributable 
DALYs in 2016. We found that 7·5% (6·6–8·4) of deaths 
globally were attributable to ambient air pollution in 2016 
(4·1 million [3·6 million to 4·6 million] deaths, 1·3 million 
[1·1 million to 1·5 million] in South Asia). Countries with 
notably high levels of attributable deaths include China 
(11·1% [9·7–12·7] of all deaths attributable to ambient 
particulate matter) and India (10·6% [9·2–11·9] of all 
deaths). The diseases with the largest proportion of burden 
attributable to air pollution are LRI and COPD; ambient 
particulate matter is responsible for 27·5% (21·4–34·4) of 
all LRI and 26·8% (16·1–38·6) of COPD deaths and 33·3% 
(26·3–40·5) of LRI deaths in children younger than 5 years. 
In terms of overall ranking, ambient particulate matter has 
increased from seventh in 1990 with 115·2 million 
(99·1 million to 132·9 million) DALYs to sixth in 2016 with 
105·7 million (94·2 million to 117·8 million) DALYs. For 
deaths, it is among the top ten ranked risk factors in 
195 countries and territories, including India and China, 
where it was in third and fourth place, respectively. Also of 
note is that updated satellite data indicate increased 
ambient air pollution in 2015–16 in West Africa that is 
driven by wind-blown dust from the Sahara. This effect has 
profound effect on disease burden in this region, as intense 
particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller 
than 2·5 µm (PM2·5) events affect Africa’s densest region.
Globally, alcohol is estimated to be the seventh-leading 
risk factor in 2016 in terms of DALYs. In the same year, 
alcohol use was estimated to have caused 99·2 million 
DALYs (88·3 million to 111·2 million), accounting for 4·2% 
(3·7–4·6) of total DALYs. This is a larger share of total 
burden than previously reported, driven primarily by 
changes made to both the exposure and RR models. This 
burden is distributed unequally among the sexes and 
regions. When decomposed by sex, alcohol use accounts 
for 6·2% (5·6–6·9) of total DALYs among men and 1·7% 
(1·4–2·0) of total DALYs among women. When decomposed 
by region in 2016, alcohol use accounts for 13·9% 
(11·5–16·8) of age-standardised DALYs in eastern Europe, 
4·0% (3·4–4·6) of age-standardised DALYs in Southeast 
Asia, but only 0·8% (0·6–1·0) of age-standardised DALYs 
in the Middle East. Alcohol use attributable DALYs have 
also increased by more than 25% over the years 1990–2016, 
driven primarily by increased consumption in South Asia, 
Southeast Asia, and Central Asia, among both men and 
women. Globally, alcohol use exposure has increased by 
15·2% (8·7–22·6) over that time frame among men and 
decreased by 3·2% (–9·1 to 3·1) among women. However, 
the largest increases in exposure have been in countries in 
the low-middle quintile of SDI. Globally, alcohol use is the 
leading risk factor in DALYS between the ages of 15 years 
and 49 years in 2016. However, unlike tobacco or drugs, 
governments have been discouraged from efforts to limit

alcohol’s availability by trade agreements and disputes. 
Given alcohol’s health burden within these age groups, an 
increased focus on alcohol control policies is needed to 
effectively address this risk factor.
It is worth noting some key results for dietary risks as 
well. In 2016, suboptimal diet was the second-leading risk 
factor for deaths and DALYs globally, accounting for 18·8% 
(16·0–21·7) of all deaths and 9·6% (8·2–11·1) of all DALYs. 
Comparing men and women, suboptimal diet accounts for 
the greatest percentage of total deaths in men (19·0% 
[16·3–21·8]) and the second largest in women (18·6% 
[15·7–21·7]). Meanwhile, suboptimal diet accounts for the 
second-largest percent of total DALYs in both men (10·6% 
[9·1–12·2]) and women (8·4% [7·0–9·9]). More than 50% 
of deaths (51·5% [44·2–59·2]) and DALYs (54·1% 
[47·1–61·5]) attributable to suboptimal diet were due to 
cardiovascular diseases. Among the individual dietary 
risks, a diet low in whole grains accounted for the largest 
number of deaths (4·6% [3·0–6·4]), followed by a diet low 
in fruits (4·3% [2·7–6·3]) and a diet high in sodium 
(4·2% [1·2–8·3]). Leading dietary risks for DALYs were low 
intakes of whole grains (2·6% [1·8–3·6]), fruits (2·6% 
[1·6–3·7]), and nuts and seeds (2·1% [1·4–2·8]). The 
greatest increase in attributable deaths and DALYs between 
1990 and 2016 occurred for a diet high in red meat, followed 
by a diet high in sugar-sweetened beverages and a diet low 
in milk, respectively.
Discussion
General findings
Based on the analysis of 22717 sources, we estimated 
disease burden attributable to 84 metabolic, environmental, 
occupational, and behavioural risk factors or clusters of 
risks from 1990 to 2016 in 195 countries and territories. In 
2016, all risks combined contributed to 59·9% (58·4–61·3) 
of deaths and 45·2% (43·2–47·3) of DALYs worldwide, 
compared with 60·3% (59·0–61·6) of deaths and 49·6% 
(47·6–51·7) of DALYs in 1990. The role of changes in risk 
factors in explaining changes in deaths and DALYs varies 
considerably across causes and ages, with the largest 
effects noted in children due to infectious diseases. Since 
1990, exposure increased significantly for 30 risks, did not 
change significantly for four risks, and decreased 
significantly for 31 risks. The risks with the highest 
increases in SEVs include high body-mass index, 
occupational exposure to diesel engine exhaust, and 
occupational exposure to trichloroethylene, while the risks 
with the largest decreases in exposure are diet high in 
transfatty acids, household air pollution from solid fuels, 
and unsafe sanitation.
We found substantial heterogeneity across countries in 
the leading risk factors. Some notable patterns are the role 
of unsafe sexual practices as a driver of the HIV epidemic 
in Eastern and Southern Africa and the role of alcohol 
consumption in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. There 
are also marked spatial patterns for other risks such as high 
BMI in Central America, North Africa and the Middle East, 
and Oceania. Interpreting spatial patterns needs to take 
into account the fact that some risks have a strong 
relationship with socioeconomic development. Several 
environmental and behavioural risks, including water, 
sanitation, handwashing, household air pollution, and 
childhood growth failure decline profoundly with 
development. Another cluster of risks tends to increase 
with socioeconomic development, including high BMI, 
high SBP, red meat consumption, sugar-sweetened 
beverages, alcohol, and high FPG.
Cross-cutting themes
Many factors should determine government priorities for 
action including the size of the problem, inequalities 
related to the problem, likely future trends, the availability 
of effective policy options, and the opportunity cost of 
tackling a particular problem. In this analysis, we provided 
information about the size of the problem, trends in 
exposure in the last 27 years, and the range of exposure at 
given levels of socioeconomic development. Problems that

are large, increasing, and variable across countries at the 
same level of development likely warrant particular policy 
attention. Our analysis showed that components of diet, 
obesity, FPG, and SBP are the most prominent global risks 
fulfilling these criteria. Because of the strong inter-
relationships between these risks, the true driver of this 
cluster is likely diet, the risk in BMI, or both, with knock-
on consequences for FPG and SBP. The rise of obesity and 
the associated increases in FPG and SBP warrant con-
siderable global policy attention. Other major risks that 
should continue to receive attention—even intensified 
attention in some locations—such as smoking, are never-
theless declining at the global level. The unique 
combination of large current effect and increasing 
exposure puts obesity in a special category of risks. Obesity 
is likely to not only influence future population health in 
many locations, but will have considerable financial 
implications for health systems, given what we know about 
treatment costs for the associated diseases. Since important 
drivers of obesity such as physical activity and diet patterns 
are adopted in childhood and adolescence, more work is 
needed to proactively address the adoption of these risks in 
these younger age groups.
For the first time, we assess the contribution of changes 
of risk exposures to the overall global trend for deaths and 
DALYs; for example, in the past 10 years, changes in all risk 
exposures contributed to an 10·8% (8·3–13·1) decline in 
DALYs, while other factors contributed to a 16·5% 
(14·1–18·8) decrease in DALYs. More detailed assessments 
show large declines in CMNN causes and increases in 
injuries and non-communicable DALYs. In each case, the 
contribution of other factors was substantially larger than 
the contribution of risk reduction. Our findings of the 
relatively small contribution of risk reduction to the 
declines in NCDs are not at odds with published studies 
for the UK and the USA,20–22 because we are reporting at 
the global level; our results at the national level suggest a 
larger role for risk reduction in some high-SDI locations. 
These observations lead to two directions for further 
analysis. First, what is the explanation for the declines 
driven by other factors? Some of this effect might be social 
policy working through various causal channels, and some 
is likely due to improvements in access to high-quality 
health care. This is particularly true for conditions such as 
selected cancers, ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, chronic kidney diseases, HIV
/AIDS, tuberculosis, 
and maternal mortality, for which health care is known to 
have large effects. Second, in view of the enormous 
potential of risk reduction to change health outcomes as 
documented in this and many other studies, why has 
progress on many risks been comparatively slow? For 
example, even though global tobacco consumption is 
declining in terms of rates, the pace of decline has been 
remarkably slow on average, despite more than 50 years of 
good evidence on the harms of tobacco. The relatively poor 
track record for global risk reduction might in part reflect 
the low rate of investment in risk reduction compared with 
curative health care. It might also reflect the continuing 
challenge of changing many risky behaviours. Relatively 
little funding for research on changing behaviours 
compared with new diagnostics and therapeutics might 
also be part of the explanation of the prevention paradox.23,24 
Changing behavioural risks could also require more than 
government action; harnessing the private sector to 
facilitate behavioural change might also be crucial.
Important changes in GBD 2016 compared with in GBD 
2015 (risks ordered by global rank)
Systolic blood pressure
Increased SBP remains the leading global risk at Level 3 in 
the GBD risk hierarchy. Highly effective interventions exist 
to manage blood pressure at the primary care level, as do a 
range of public health interventions, so it is quite remarkable 
that global exposure to increased SBP is increasing. Part of 
this increase might be tied to the global rise in high BMI, 
but the increase in SBP represents significant missed 
opportunity for the world’s health systems. In 54 countries 
high SBP is actually declining, while its increase in China is 
now well documented in a series of population-based 
surveys.25–27 Tackling rising SBP is a global concern, but this 
is particularly important in those locations where rates are 
increasing. In view of the effect of the risk and the large 
array of available, effective interventions, health systems 
and the global health community need to mobilise increased 
resources and policy attention to tackle this problem. It 
might be necessary to design a variety of public policies 
including food reformulation to reduce sodium content and 
efforts to incentivise primary care providers to give priority 
to the management of SBP.28–30
Tobacco
In moving toward developing a comprehensive picture of 
tobacco use globally, in GBD 2016, we have for the first 
time included smokeless tobacco use as a risk factor. While 
the burden of smokeless tobacco is minimal in the 
majority of countries, it is of huge importance in south 
Asia, where the highest risk-weighted exposure is observed 
in Bangladesh (risk-weighted exposure of 0·75 [0·61–0·87]), 
Bhutan (0·53 [0·44–0·62]), Myanmar (0·50 [0·42–0·59]), 
Nepal (0·50 [0·42–0·58]), and India (0·45 [0·43–0·47]). In 
these countries more women use smokeless tobacco 
products than smoked tobacco products, and we find that 
use of any tobacco products, smoked or smokeless, 
continuously increases with age, a regional age pattern 
that differs from the global and male regional age pattern. 
The combination of high exposure and large population 
results in a majority of global deaths attributable to 
smokeless tobacco in 2016 occurring in India, where it is 
also the leading risk factor for oral cancer.
In GBD 2016, we also improved the estimation of burden 
attributable to second-hand  smoke. At the global level, 
while the burden of second-hand  smoke remains sub-
stantial, exposure to second-hand  smoke has been 
declining significantly at an annualised rate of change of 
 Global Health Metrics
www.thelancet.com   Vol 390   September 16, 2017 
1409
1·9% (1·5–2·4). These reductions are likely attributable to 
a wide range of public health measures to control tobacco, 
which have accelerated in a large number of countries 
since the implementation of the Framework Convention 
on Tobacco Control (FCTC).31
Progress combatting the tobacco epidemic has resulted 
in global declines in prevalence of tobacco use and second-
hand  smoke exposure, yet the number of deaths and 
DALYs attributable to tobacco has increased since 1990. 
Increases in burden were driven by a combination of 
population growth and population ageing, along with 
persistently high smoking prevalence in some of the most 
populous countries of the world. Taken together, we can 
expect the burden of tobacco to remain high in years to 
come, unless the rate of progress is significantly 
accelerated. Many countries with persistently high levels of 
daily smoking recorded marginal progress in the past 
decade, and smoking remains a leading risk factor in most 
countries. The fact that tobacco use patterns diverge by 
location, level of development, and sex highlights the need 
for more tailored approaches to change smoking 
behaviours in the future. Particularly worrisome are the 
trends among young men and women. For example, in 
Indonesia, a country that has not yet ratified the FCTC,31 
more than half of men aged 20–24 years are daily smokers. 
Understanding what works—and what does not—for 
tobacco control across contexts and within subpopulations 
(ie, men and women, younger and older individuals, 
various socioeconomic groups) is of growing priority. To 
significantly and permanently change the toll of tobacco, a 
renewed and sustained focus is needed on comprehensive 
tobacco control policies around the world.
Fasting plasma glucose
The global increase in FPG is likely tied to the increase in 
BMI. While exposure is increasing, age-standardised 
attributable mortaliy rate is not; a related pattern is that the 
prevalence of diabetes is increasing, but deaths from 
diabetes have been declining, likely because clinical 
management of the macrovascular complications of 
diabetes has improved in many (but not all) locations. 
Prevention trials show that with intensive resources 
devoted to weight loss and physical activity, reductions in 
FPG can be achieved; however, these interventions have 
not been implemented at a national scale and adherence in 
the long run is challenging. Systematic efforts to screen for 
high FPG implemented in some countries may increase 
awareness and action in more patients but can be resource-
intensive. Clinical interventions to reduce FPG can be 
effective, although there are more recent debates on the 
appropriate targets for treatment in some cases. With FPG 
increasing in many settings, it is difficult to determine the 
population effect of treatment of blood sugar on population 
FPG. FPG remains one of the risk factors that is most 
likely influenced at the primary health-care level, 
emphasising the role of universal coverage for primary care 
in a multipronged response to this increasing problem.
Body-mass index
One of the most alarming risks in the analysis is increased 
BMI, because its burden is large and increasing, and it is 
prevalent across all levels of SDI.32,33 The potential drivers 
of this global epidemic include changes in food industries 
and systems, which increase availability, accessibility, and 
affordability of energy-dense foods, along with intense 
marketing of such foods, as well as reduced opportunities 
for physical activity.34 A range of interventions have been 
proposed to reduce obesity, including restricting the 
advertisement of unhealthy foods to children, improving 
school meals, taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, and 
taxation to reduce consumption of other unhealthy foods 
and subsidies to increase intake of healthy foods, and 
using supply-chain incentives to increase production of 
healthy foods.35 However, the evidence base that many of 
these interventions can affect trends in obesity at scale is 
currently weak.36 What we know without a doubt is that 
obesity rates continue to increase in almost all locations. 
Low-SDI and middle-SDI countries generally have little 
financial resources for nutrition programs and mostly rely 
on external donors whose programmes often preferentially 
target undernutrition.37 The increase in exposure to high 
BMI is greater than the increase in attributable burden 
largely because cardiovascular disease death rates continue 
to decline because of other changes, particularly improve-
ments in treatment and declines in smoking and high 
cholesterol. Proposed policies, even if fully imple 
mented, 
are unlikely to rapidly reduce the prevalence of obesity. 
While not a solution to the rise of overweight and obesity, 
clinical interventions that control high SBP, cholesterol, 
and FPG (the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease) 
can be used to mitigate some of the cardiovascular ill-
effects.20 Expanded use of such interventions among obese 
people could effectively reduce the disease burden of high 
BMI. Sustained progress, however, will require policies 
that effectively control weight in childhood and in young 
and middle-aged adults.
Diet
In GBD 2016, poor dietary habits were the second leading 
risk factor at Level 2 of the hierarchy for mortality globally, 
accounting for nearly one in every five deaths. The overall 
burden of dietary risks at the global level was 14·8% 
(11·7–18·5) lower than in GBD 2015. Additionally, 
important differences were observed in the attributable 
burden and the ranking of individual dietary risks. Multiple 
factors have contributed to these differences, including 
using more data sources, as well as improving the method 
of estimation of the mean and distribution of intake for 
each dietary factor. In GBD 2016, for the first time, we used 
sales data to inform our estimates of consumption for most 
dietary factors. Using sales data, in addition to improving 
our overall data coverage, allowed us to capture recent 
trends in consumption. This was particularly important for 
specific dietary factors, such as sugar-sweetened beverages, 
which have been the target of dietary policies in several 
 Global Health Metrics
1410

countries.38–43 Additionally, to improve the consistency of 
definitions of dietary risk factors across surveys, we made a 
systematic effort to obtain and re-extract individual-level 
data from nutrition surveys. To make the current level of 
intake and optimal level of intake more comparable, we 
used the absolute level of intake (rather than the intake 
standardised to 2000 kcal per day) as the primary exposure 
in GBD 2016. We also corrected our estimated daily intake 
of each individual dietary factor for within-person variation 
and characterised the usual intake at the population level. 
Finally, given the differences in the health effects and 
patterns of intake for legumes and vegetables, we estimated 
the burden of disease attributable to low intake of legumes 
and low intake of vegetables separately.
The decade of 2016–25 has been declared as the Decade 
of Action on Nutrition by the United Nations General 
Assembly.44 GBD 2016 provides a comprehensive picture 
of various forms of malnutrition (ie, undernutrition, 
overweight or obesity, and poor dietary habits) across all 
countries at the start of the Decade of Action on Nutrition 
and can inform priorities for evidence-based interventions 
in each country. GBD also provides an independent avenue 
to annually monitor the progress of countries toward 
achieving their nutrition-related goals in a comparable and 
consistent manner. Our results show that among all forms 
of malnutrition, poor dietary habits, particularly low intake 
of healthy foods, is the leading risk factor for mortality. This 
finding has important implications for national govern-
ments and international organisations aiming at ending 
malnutrition over the next decade, highlighting the need 
for comprehensive food system interventions to promote 
the production, distribution, and consumption of healthy 
foods across nations.
Low birthweight and short gestation
Low birthweight and short gestation have been added for 
GBD 2016; they are the third-leading global risk at Level 3 
in the GBD risk hierarchy. Improvements in burden 
attributable to low birthweight and short gestation have 
been largely driven by other factors influencing neonatal 
death rates, given that exposure to low birthweight and 
short gestation have not improved much over the past 
27 years. Little progress in exposure suggests suboptimal 
coverage of interventions and programmes that can prevent 
low birthweight and short gestation. These include women-
centred services for optimising nutrition (including 
minimising obesity), infection control, smoking cessation, 
and preventive care for pregnant women or those 
contemplating pregnancy.45–47 Efforts should also focus on 
maximising the quality of antenatal care services to identify 
and 
appropriately 
manage 
at-risk 
and 
high-risk 
pregnancies,48 including avoidance of provider-initiated 
preterm delivery. If evidence-based interventions are 
employed, it should be possible even in resource-limited 
settings to shift the risk curve for those babies who will be 
born early, small, or both, despite best efforts. Before birth, 
this includes potentially antenatal steroid administration to 
promote lung development;49 at birth, this requires 
presence of adequately trained and equipped neonatal 
resuscitation services;50,51 post-delivery, it should include 
physicians with neonatal specialisation and availability of 
supportive equipment such as continuous positive airway 
pressure.52 Facility-based infection control measures are 
crucial to prevent nosocomial transmission, as such events 
are highly lethal in low birthweight or short gestation 
neonates.53 The inclusion of this risk for a major cause of 
DALYs—namely, neonatal mortality—also expands the 
share of overall burden that can be attributed to risks in 
general. More work remains, however, to understand the 
relationship between low birthweight and short gestation 
and childhood growth failure after 1 month. Our analysis to 
date may actually underestimate the importance of this risk 
if the share of childhood growth failure that can be traced to 
low birthweight and gestational age is fully established.
Alcohol
Globally, alcohol is estimated to be the seventh-leading risk 
factor in 2016 in both DALYs (4·2% [3·7–4·6]) and deaths 
(5·2% [4·4–6·0]). Previous studies have noted the 
possibility that the preventive effects of alcohol might have 
been overstated due to selection bias and choice of the 
reference population.2,54–56 Our findings lend further 
credence to these hypotheses; with the exception of IHD, 
our results show either a minor or non-significant 
preventive effect for causes previously estimated to have 
large preventive effects. Further, our analysis noted a much 
larger risk of neoplasms due to alcohol use than previously 
reported. Combined with our new data for alcohol use 
exposure, alcohol use is ranked as one of the leading risk 
factors, surpassing cholesterol as a share of total DALYs, 
comparied with previous iterations of GBD.4–6
Ensemble distributions
In GBD 2016 we have introduced a more accurate method 
for developing the distributions of exposure for many risk 
factors. Our work on distributions and the shift to ensemble 
distributions shows that the assessment of attributable 
burden is sensitive to distributional assumptions. Given 
that a number of risks, such as BMI, SBP, cholesterol, and 
FPG, rise exponentially as a function of exposure, the 
estimation of the tail of the distribution has an important 
effect on the results. The ensemble modelling approach 
can provide more accurate estimation of the full 
distribution, including the tails of the distribution. In 
general, we believe that the assessment of the dis-
trib 
ution of the risks deserves more careful attention in 
future research.
Comparison of GBD 2016 to other estimates
The GBD study is the most comprehensive effort to 
conduct a population-level CRA across countries and risks. 
Differences between GBD 2016 estimates and other global 
estimates are generally related to approaches to data 
processing, access to data sources, and analysis decisions. 
 Global Health Metrics

1411
For several risks, including smoking,57 ambient ozone 
pollution, household air pollution from solid fuels, lead 
exposure,58 intimate partner violence,59 unsafe water 
source,60 and breastfeeding, GBD estimates were lower 
than published WHO estimates.57–60 These discrepancies 
can be attributed to different definitions, methodological 
decisions, granularity, and input data. For some findings, 
annual estimates might disagree, but regional patterns 
were consistent between WHO and GBD. UNICEF61 
produces estimates for child stunting that are lower than 
GBD estimates with some disagreement where progress 
has been made globally. There is more consistency in 
estimates between UNICEF and GBD for child wasting 
and child underweight.61 GBD estimates for the prevalence 
of low birthweight and short gestation are slightly lower 
when compared with WHO estimates, but show similar 
geographical patterns.62 Scientific literature reveals similar 
results to GBD for impaired kidney function63 and low 
birthweight and short gestation;64,65 research analysing 
ambient air pollution66 differed from GBD estimates due to 
older methods and less granularity. Research published on 
iron-deficiency anaemia67 differs from GBD in methods 
and definitions, resulting in generally higher GBD 
estimates. GBD estimates were much lower than published 
research on occupational estimates,3,68,69 largely due to 
different cause-outcome pairs and GBD’s application of the 
CRA approach (see appendix 1 p 10).
Future directions
Interpretation of our results and prioritisation at the 
national level might also need to take into account the 
variable strength of evidence supporting the causal 
connection for each risk-outcome pair. In GBD 2016, we 
have continued to use the World Cancer Research Fund 
criteria of convincing or probable evidence to select risk-
outcome pairs for inclusion. Some aspects of these 
definitions are subjective. Not all researchers would agree 
on the interpretation of the available evidence as fulfilling 
these criteria. For example, there are six studies on non-
exclusive breastfeeding and LRI; there are two studies on 
discontinued breastfeeding and diarrhoeal diseases. We 
have sought to quantify the number of studies of different 
kinds that are available to support these judgements in 
table 1, but not all studies support causality to the same 
extent. Randomised trials, if well conducted, provide the 
strongest evidence of causality, because they are likely not 
affected by confounding. But even randomised trials can 
have biases when there are missing observations, as is 
often the case. Randomised trials are also not feasible in 
many cases, or if feasible, not representative for many 
risks, including environmental risks. Cohort studies can 
provide compelling evidence, but many cohorts do not 
adequately control for socioeconomic confounders and can 
suffer from many other issues related to the quality of 
exposure measurement or outcome ascertainment. To go 
beyond, the quantification of the number of studies of each 
type we have provided here will necessitate a deeper 
analysis of the potential limitations of all 2579 studies used 
across the risk-outcome pairs. In future work, we plan to 
evaluate the quality of each of these studies with a 
standardised approach and work toward an overall evidence 
summary. There is also a more fundamental philosophical 
question about the presentation of risk information. 
Should decision makers only pay attention to risk factor 
quantification for those risks supported by the strongest 
causal evidence such as randomised trials? Or do notions 
such as the precautionary principle suggest that we should 
pay attention to risk quantification even for risk-outcome 
pairs where the evidence is less definitive.70–72 Because the 
social response to risks, particularly risks that might be 
emerging, can take considerable time, ignoring risks for 
which the evidence is less definitive might actually lead to 
worse outcomes for society. Conversely, in a world of scarce 
political and financial resources, devoting attention to risks 
that might turn out not to be causal might lead to less 
action on more well documented risks.
As part of future iterations of GBD, we plan to quantify 
the burden attributable to some distal social risks. We have 
embarked on this work, but it proves to have challenges 
that are qualitatively different than many of the risks 
included here. For nearly all risk-outcome pairs, we 
assume in the absence of other evidence that the RRs by 
age and sex are generalisable across populations (the 
exception is for BMI in Asian and non-Asian populations 
for breast cancer). In principle, if there is evidence of 
statistically significant RRs for different population groups, 
we would incorporate these into the CRA. For distal social 
risks, the pathways to outcomes can be modified in many 
ways by other risks or by health-system interventions. We 
expect that the RR due to low education for 40-year-old 
men would be different in Norway than in Kenya. Given 
the greater potential for variation in RRs for distal risks, 
inclusion in GBD will require more local quantification of 
RRs and then a further modelling step to estimate RRs for 
these determinants for all locations. Our first planned 
target for this quantification is educational attainment.
Given the global policy focus on the potential health 
effects of climate change driven by rising levels of 
greenhouse gases, and consequently temperature, we will 
add temperature and precipitation as risk factors that are 
quantified on an annual basis in future iterations of GBD. 
Even though most of the potential harm that might come 
from rising temperatures or extreme weather events will 
occur in the future, in some locations, we might already 
find significant attributable burden.73 This analysis will 
need to examine the relationship between disease and 
mortality risk and temperature for each relevant outcome. 
For some outcomes, these relationships are likely to be 
U shaped, with an optimal temperature for minimum risk. 
These U-shaped relationships could mean that for some 
outcomes in some locations, rising temperature might 
reduce harm, even if in most locations it will increase 
burden. Likewise, a major issue in understanding the 
temperature and health outcome relationships is that we

1412

would expect these to be attenuated in high-SDI settings, 
where many individuals can protect themselves from some 
of the consequences. In other words, generalising from 
studies in high-SDI locations to other locations might 
underestimate the risk relationships.
In the GBD CRA approach, the TMREL is the level of 
risk exposure that leads to minimum risk for individuals. 
In principle, the TMREL could vary by location, age, and 
sex. To date, the TMREL in the GBD work has been 
selected to be universal. For more detail on TMREL, see 
appendix 1 (p 22). The analysis of alcohol, where for IHD 
there is a protective effect at mild to moderate consumption 
but a harmful effect for neoplasms and injuries, is a good 
example of where it would be desirable to vary TMREL by 
age. In younger ages, injuries will be more important than 
cardiovascular diseases, pushing the TMREL toward zero 
consumption of alcohol, whereas at older ages, the TMREL 
might be higher. Letting the TMREL vary by age and sex 
and even location will add an extra analytical step to GBD; 
like all other estimation steps, this can have estimation 
error. To date, we have thought the estimation error 
associated with a TMREL that varies may not make the 
effort worthwhile. As evidence accumulates on some risks 
like alcohol, we will carefully evaluate this position.
Limitations
A study of this scope has many limitations. Here we discuss 
the limitations that apply to the overall risk factor analytical 
framework and limitations in the estimation approach for 
new risks and risks that have undertaken significant 
revisions from GBD 2015. More details and limitations of 
the analytical approach for each risk factor are presented in 
appendix 1 (p 43). First, we continue to include risk-outcome 
pairs that meet the World Cancer Research Fund criteria of 
convincing or probable evidence for causality. While these 
criteria have proven a useful bar for inclusion, there is an 
important subjective element to their inter 
pretation. Some 
risk-outcome pairs included in this study might not meet 
these criteria or alternative criteria that are developed as 
new randomised trials, cohort studies, or case-control 
studies are published. Second, we used published cohort 
studies to evaluate the degree to which different risks are 
mediated through other risks. Estimates of pathways of 
mediation are used to compute the burden attributable to 
aggregates of risk factors such as all behavioural risks or all 
risks combined. While we have conducted pooled cohort 
analyses to strengthen the assessment of mediation, this 
work was not yet ready for inclusion in this assessment. 
Pooled cohort studies have the advantage of providing a 
more standardised framework for assessing mediation 
across multiple risks. A related issue is the validation of the 
aggregation of risks in GBD. Pooled cohort studies will 
allow (in some circumstances) the opportunity to estimate 
if the aggregation of GBD RRs is as predictive of outcomes 
as suggested by the risk-by-risk analysis with mediation. 
Third, we have used the Das Gupta formula applied for 
each 5-year interval and for GBD Level 3 causes. 
Aggregations at higher levels of causes and for longer 
periods of time are based on these more granular analyses 
to guarantee consistency. Given the non-linear nature of the 
Das Gupta decomposition formula, however, alternative 
results are possible using different time periods and causes 
in the formula. Fourth, we have introduced the use of 
ensemble distributions to improve the empirical fitting of 
distributions of risk exposure in settings where only mean 
and standard deviation are known or where we use models 
to predict the mean and standard deviation of exposure. 
Ensemble models provide more accurate fits as assessed 
out of sample for settings with microdata. The underlying 
assumption is that the same ensemble weights are 
applicable across all settings. It is possible that the shape of 
distributions of risk exposure might vary across locations, 
for example because of the effects of access to treatment.
Limitations that apply to new risks in GBD 2016 or risks 
with significant estimation updates are presented here. For 
low birthweight and short gestation, we have included the 
effect of low birthweight and short gestation only on 
neonatal outcomes; we have not found the evidence to meet 
our inclusion criteria for the link between low birthweight 
and short gestation and NCDs in adult age groups. Our 
analysis of RRs has used a very large US-linked birth cohort 
dataset and much more limited data from middle-SDI and 
low-SDI populations. Given the large number of observations 
from the USA, our results are heavily influenced by the 
pattern of RRs across birthweight and gestational age in that 
population. The microdata used to develop the ensemble 
dis 
tributions for birthweight and gestational age are largely 
from middle-SDI and high-SDI locations. The esti 
mation of 
alcohol use relies heavily on sales data, which are limited 
and whose quality we cannot easily assess. Also, the 
estimation of unrecorded con 
sumption of alcohol is based 
on limited data and has significant uncertainty; nevertheless, 
we feel it is important to include it and plan to continue to 
look for additional sources of information to improve the 
estimation of unrecorded consumption in future iterations 
of GBD. Lastly, methods for calculating TMREL rely on 
observed DALYs for a given time rather than on the expected 
share of DALYs estimated from alcohol use alone. Future 
iterations of GBD will likely need to test this assumption 
further and determine if separate TMREL by age and sex 
should be calculated.
Conclusion
Understanding the levels and trends of major risks for 
human health is essential to prioritise public health action 
and evaluate the success of different programmes and 
policies. This study provides a comprehensive and 
comparable assessment of 84 metabolic, environmental, 
occupational, and behavioural risks across locations and 
time. Our findings show that risk modification has been an 
important contributor to reductions in communicable, 
maternal, neonatal, and nutritional causes, but has played a 
relatively small part in trends in NCDs. Conflicting trends 
in risks for NCDs at the global level, such as the decline in

smoking prevalence coupled with the rise in obesity, FPG, 
and SBP, account for this finding. By contrast with trends 
in diseases and injuries at the global level and even at the 
national level, there is much greater heterogeneity of global 
trends across risks and considerable geographical variation 
in leading risks as well. Public health action in each country 
and region needs to focus on the major risks in that 
community. Our findings reinforce the crucial need for 
robust monitoring of the exposure to risks to health and 
assessment of the evidence supporting causal effects for 
each risk-outcome pair; GBD provides the main global 
mechanism for this monitoring function.
