ontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), an extremely diverse group with a wide spectrum of virulence, appear to be rising in 
prevalence. This may be due to both increased awareness and improved diagnosis, among other factors. Most NTM-pulmonary 
disease (NTM-PD) infections are caused by the slow growing Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) however, other species can 
also cause pulmonary disease including M. abscessus, M. xenopi, M. malmoense and M. kansasii. Symptoms of NTM-PD vary considerably 
and may include chronic cough, with or without sputum production or haemoptysis. Treatment options are limited at present and associated 
with significant intolerance, treatment failures and drug–drug interactions. Further prospective studies are needed to define suitable drug 
regimens for different NTM species and to improve knowledge of the natural history and epidemiology of NTM-PD.

Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are a diverse group of bacteria with a wide spectrum of 
virulence.1 They are a microaerobic, non-motile organisms that have a lipid-rich, hydrophobic 
 
cell wall that is substantially thicker compared with most other bacteria.2 NTM are associated 
with biofilm formation, which contributes to disinfectant- and antibiotic-resistance.3–5 Many 
of these organisms are also resistant to high temperature and low pH.6–8 Ubiquitous in the 
environment, NTM are found with the greatest concentrations in water sources, both natural 
and treated, and in soil sources.9 There are currently over 170 species of mycobacteria and more 
are likely to be discovered in the future owing to improved culturing techniques and molecular 
technology advances.10
The majority of NTM-pulmonary disease (NTM-PD) infections are caused by the slow growing 
Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) that includes Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium 
intracellulare, although other species including M. abscessus, M. xenopi, M. malmoense and M. 
kansasii can also cause lung disease. Not all NTM are considered pathogenic, with species such 
as Mycobacterium gordonae commonly isolated but not usually associated with the development 
of NTM-PD and a wide variability reported in the clinical relevance of species.12 Co-infection with 
different NTM strains or other bacteria has also been reported.9,13 NTM lung disease is characterised 
by clinical, microbiological and radiological criteria.1 High resolution computed tomography (CT) 
scanning may consist of a variety of disease patterns including nodular/bronchiectatic disease, 
fibrocavitary disease, solitary pulmonary nodule, disseminated disease, and hypersensitivity-like 
disease.1 Acquisition of NTM is believed to be from the environment; however, emerging literature, 
using sequencing of NTM isolates, suggest that indirect cross infection of M. abscessus is possible 
in patients with cystic fibrosis.14 This has led to changes in infection control standards in these 
patient groups.15,16 
NTM are treated with antimicrobial chemotherapy, however treatment response is often poor, 
and side effects significant. Deciding which mycobacteria and patients to treat, and when, 
 
and the assessment of response to treatment is very difficult. The purpose of this review is to 
provide a succinct summary of issues surrounding the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment 
of NTM-PD.
Epidemiology
In contrast to tuberculosis, NTM isolation in pulmonary specimens does not necessarily equate 
with active pulmonary disease, thus the incidence and prevalence of NTM pulmonary infections 
is difficult to characterise accurately.9 In addition, unlike tuberculosis, isolating NTM does not 
constitute a reportable condition in many countries. Population-based data for prevalence 
are available mainly from the US, Europe, New Zealand and Australia (where NTM isolation is 
reportable).17 These estimates are based on a mixture of microbiology laboratory reports, medical

insurance returns and surveys. Annual prevalence estimates in North 
America and Australia range from 3.2 to 9.8 per 100,000.17 In Europe 
the estimates are generally lower, up to 3.3/100,000.17,18 The prevalence 
is significantly higher in certain regions and patient groups and period 
prevalence has been put at over 100/100,000 in the over 65-year-olds 
in the US over an 11-year period.19 The incidence of NTM disease is 
increasing throughout the world,11,17 with some estimates of an increase 
of 8.2% per year19 NTM-PD is currently more common in the US than 
tuberculosis.20 Improvements in awareness and diagnosis may in part 
underlie this rise. 
In addition to the difference in prevalence, the predominant NTM species 
has also been reported to differ substantially by geographical region.21 
To obtain information of NTM species distribution, in an NTM-Network 
European Trials Group (NET) collaborative study, species identification 
data for 20,182 patients, from 62 laboratories in 30 countries 
 
across six continents was collected.22 In total, 91 different species were 
isolated; M. avium complex predominated in most areas, although 
M. Kansaii predominated in Poland and Slovakia and M. Xenopi 
predominated in Hungary. MAC was most frequently isolated in Japan, 
Australia and South Africa.19,23–25  
Pre-existing chronic lung disease (bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis, chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) 
predisposes patients to acquiring NTM respiratory infection.26,27 Other 
disease risk factors include thoracic skeletal abnormalities, taking 
immunomodulatory drugs and rheumatoid arthritis.17 Clustering of 
disease within families may suggest a heritable genetic predisposition to 
susceptibility of NTM-PD. Defects in interleukin-12 and interferon-gamma 
defence pathways may increase susceptibility to NTM infections28 and 
these defects have been described both in individuals and in familial 
clustering of disease.29 A recent study utilising exome sequencing 
of patients, family members and controls has suggested a multi-
hit, multi-genetic predisposition to NTM disease.30 In addition to host 
predisposition, environmental exposure is likely to play a significant role 
in predisposition to NTM-PD, as suggested by variance in prevalence and 
mortality between and within countries. In studies in the US,19 Japan31 and 
Australia,32 temperature, humidity and alteration in soil components have 
impacted on NTM prevalence.
 
Mortality in NTM-PD is significant, with 5-year mortality after definite 
NTM disease at 40.1%, according to Danish population data.33 In this 
study, patients with M. xenopi had the worst prognosis. A randomised 
controlled study of NTM treatment regimens by the British Thoracic 
Society demonstrated similarly high 5-year all-cause mortality 
rates of 38.8% for MAC, 48.5% for M. malmoense and 38.2% for M. 
xenopi.34 Other retrospective studies have specifically looked at 
MAC lung disease and assessed specific characteristics associated 
with a worse prognosis. The 5-year all-cause mortality of patients 
with definite pulmonary MAC was 25.6% in a retrospective study 
(n=164) of patients with pulmonary MAC disease.35,36 High Charlson 
comorbidity index scores and the presence of cavitary lesions 
were associated with higher mortality. Prognostic factors of all-
cause mortality were identified in a retrospective analysis of 634 
HIV-negative patients with MAC lung disease.37 The all-cause 5-year 
mortality was 23.9% and negative prognostic factors of all-cause 
mortality included: male sex, older age, presence of comorbidity, 
body mass index (BMI) <18.5 kg/m2, anaemia, hypoalbuminemia and 
erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥50 mm/h. In a retrospective review 
of 72 patients with nodular bronchiectatic MAC lung disease, lower 
BMI, cavities and macrolide-resistance at initial visit seemed to be 
associated with progression to deteriorating disease over 5 years.38 
In another retrospective analysis, which involved data from 52 adults 
with non cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and coexisting MAC infection 
over a 5-year period, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and nodules 
with cavitation and emphysema on high-resolution CT scans at 
presentation were identified as a strong independent predictors of 
mortality.39 In a retrospective cohort study of 124 patients with NTM, 
predominately M. avium, the most important predictor for increased 
mortality was the radiological appearance of a consolidation.40 Direct 
comparisons between studies are difficult due to the differences in 
treatment regimens, patient cohorts and methodologies. 
Diagnosis
NTM are ubiquitous in the environment and isolation from sputum 
does not always signify disease. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) 
and the Infectious Disease Society of American (IDSA) jointly published 
guidelines on diagnosis of NTM infections in 2007 (Table 1).1 An early 
differential diagnosis of NTM lung disease from pulmonary tuberculousis 
is important because the therapeutic regimen differs from that of 
pulmonary tuberculousis and it is not necessary to track the contacts 
 
of patients with NTM-PD.41
Symptoms are variable although chronic cough with or without 
sputum production or haemoptysis, is common. Other symptoms 
include fatigue, malaise, dyspnoea, fever, chest pain and weight 
loss. The evaluation of NTMs is often complicated by coexisting lung 
diseases including cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis and pneumoconiosis. 
 
For patients in whom diagnosis is not clear, expert consultation should 
be sought. High resolution CT scans showing NTM-PD are presented 
in Figure 1.
Table 1: Summary of the American Thoracic Society 
diagnostic criteria for pulmonary nontuberculous 
mycobacterial infection1
Clinical
1. Pulmonary symptoms, nodular or cavitary opacities on chest radiograph, 
or a high-resolution computed tomographic scan that shows multifocal 
bronchiectasis with multiple small nodules; And
2. Appropriate exclusion of other diagnoses.
Microbiologic
1. Positive culture results from at least two separate expectorated sputum 
samples (If the results from the initial sputum samples are nondiagnostic, 
consider repeat sputum AFB smears and cultures); Or
2. Positive culture results from at least one bronchial wash or lavage; Or
3. Transbronchial or other lung biopsy with mycobacterial histopathological 
features (granulomatous inflammation or AFB) and positive culture for NTM 
or biopsy showing mycobacterial histopathological features (granulomatous 
inflammation or AFB) and one or more sputum or bronchial washings that 
are culture positive for NTM
4. Expert consultation should be obtained when NTM are recovered that are 
either infrequently encountered or that usually represent environmental 
contamination
5. Patients who are suspected of having NTM lung disease but who do not 
meet the diagnostic criteria should be followed until the diagnosis is firmly 
established or excluded
6. Making the diagnosis of NTM lung disease does not, per se, necessitate 
the institution of therapy, which is a decision based on potential risks and 
benefits of therapy for individual patients

EUROPEAN RESPIRATORY & PULMONARY DISEASES
Current Perspectives in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Pulmonary Disease 
Treatment
The 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines are the most commonly followed 
worldwide. They recommend that treatment for most patients with 
nodular/bronchiectatic MAC disease involves a three-times-weekly 
regimen of clarithromycin (1,000 mg) or azithromycin (500 mg), 
rifampin (600 mg) and ethambutol (25 mg/kg), although in many cases 
daily treatment may be appropriate.42 For patients with fibrocavitary 
MAC lung disease or severe nodular/bronchiectatic disease, a daily 
regimen of clarithromycin (1,000 mg) or azithromycin (250 mg), rifampin 
(600 mg) or rifabutin (150–300 mg) and ethambutol (15 mg/kg) with 
consideration of three-times-weekly amikacin or streptomycin early 
in therapy is recommended. Patients should be treated until culture 
negative for 1 year while receiving antibacterial therapy.1 Similar 
combinations of drugs have also been suggested for other NTM that 
commonly cause NTM-PD such as M. kansasii, M. malmoense and 
M. xenopi.1 No established regimens of proven efficacy exist for M. 
abscessus; although standard treatment based on case series consists 
of an induction phase of intravenous therapy including medications 
such as amikacin, carbapenem, tigecycline or cefoxitim, followed by 
a continuation phase of oral antibiotics.43 A macrolide-based regimen 
is often used and surgical debridement may also be important. 
However, macrolide resistance is common in M. abscessus because 
the organism possesses an inducible macrolide-resistance gene.44,45 In 
some instances more than one NTM species is present and there are 
no data available to guide the clinician in these cases so they need to 
be evaluated and treated on an individual basis.13 
In some patients, clinical improvement and culture conversion will 
be the aim, however, for others, stability will be a more realistic 
target.1 The potential toxicity of anti-mycobacterial therapy must be 
balanced against a sometimes indolent clinical course. A patient’s 
comorbidities and quality-of-life issues are also important to take into 
account. There are currently insufficient data on the natural history of 
untreated infections to guide clinical decision-making in this respect. 
In clinical practice it is often difficult to discern whether or not disease 
progression is due to NTM. Even if NTM is diagnosed, lung disease 
treatment may not always be needed. For patients with indolent NTM 
lung disease there is usually enough time for careful consideration of 
the optimal management. Once a risk-benefit decision has been made 
to begin NTM therapy, the choice of agents and duration of treatment 
is based on the specific organism and extent of disease. Before a 
decision is made to treat with the aim of improving symptoms such as 
cough, it should be considered whether the symptoms are attributable 
to a concomitant diagnoses of bronchiectasis, sinus disease and/or 
gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Review  Lung Disease
Limitations of current treatment
The drugs used for treatment of NTM have not been developed 
specifically for these infections but rather, the rationale for their use 
has often been extrapolated from the treatment of tuberculosis and are 
often based on personal experiences of the treating clinician. The long 
duration of treatment often leads to adverse drug reactions, increased 
potential for drug–drug interactions and nonadherence to treatment or 
treatment discontinuation.46 Typical adverse events of drugs used to treat 
NTM infections and drug–drug interactions are summarised in Tables 2 
and 3. NTM infections are common in elderly people and age-related 
changes in drug absorption, metabolism and excretion may lead to a 
decline in efficacy and increased toxicity.47
Treatment practices
Adherence to the 2007 ATS/IDSA guidelines for the treatment of NTM-
PD in the US has been revealed to be poor, with suboptimal antibiotic 
regimens commonly prescribed across physician specialities.48 Overall, 
95% of the 1,286 physicians selected were in the following specialties: 
pulmonology, infectious diseases (IDs), internal medicine or family/
general practice. Out of 349 physicians who completed questionnaires, 
only 13% of antibiotic regimens prescribed for patients with MAC, were 
in accordance to ATS/IDSA guidelines. Around half (56%) did not include 
a macrolide and 16% were for macrolide monotherapy.48
Conclusions and future perspectives
NTM-PD is increasing in prevalence, leading to an emerging public 
health problem.17,49 More work is needed to investigate species-specific 
environmental niches as causes of differences in global isolation 
patterns.22 Better management of the disease remains an unmet need 
with improvements required in diagnosis, treatment, patient adherence 
to treatment and patient outcome. Present treatment options are 
limited, with drug regimens associated with significant failure and 
intolerance. Individualised treatment should be administered after careful 
consideration of both the efficacy and risk of adverse events. 
New treatments for NTM infections are imperative and more prospective 
studies are warranted to define suitable drug regimens for different 
NTM species and to better define the natural history and epidemiology 
of this condition. Due to the complexity of the problem, involvement of 
specialist centres is important. q
