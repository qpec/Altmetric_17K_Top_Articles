abstract
The link between poverty and children’s health is well recognized. Even 
temporary poverty may have an adverse effect on children’s health, and 
data consistently support the observation that poverty in childhood 
continues to have a negative effect on health into adulthood. In addition to 
childhood morbidity being related to child poverty, epidemiologic studies 
have documented a mortality gradient for children aged 1 to 15 years 
(and adults), with poor children experiencing a higher mortality rate than 
children from higher-income families. The global great recession is only now 
very slowly abating for millions of America’s children and their families. At 
this diffi
 cult time in the history of our nation’s families and immediately after 
the 50th anniversary year of President Lyndon Johnson’s War on Poverty, it 
is particularly germane for the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is 
“dedicated to the health of all children, 
” to publish a research-supported 
technical report that examines the mediators associated with the long-
recognized adverse effects of child poverty on children and their families. 
This technical report draws on research from a number of disciplines, 
including physiology, sociology, psychology, economics, and epidemiology, 
to describe the present state of knowledge regarding poverty’s negative 
impact on children’s health and development. Children inherit not only 
their parents’ genes but also the family ecology and its social milieu. Thus, 
parenting skills, housing, neighborhood, schools, and other factors (eg, 
medical care) all have complex relations to each other and infl
 uence how 
each child’s genetic canvas is expressed. Accompanying this technical report 
is a policy statement that describes specifi
 c actions that pediatricians 
and other child advocates can take to attenuate the negative effects of the 
mediators identifi
 ed in this technical report and improve the well-being of 
our nation’s children and their families.
There is no keener revelation of a society’s soul than the way in which it treats its 
children.

The advent of the Great Recession in 
December 2007 heralded an increase 
in child poverty from a prerecession 
13.3 million children to 16.3 million 
children by 2010.1, 
2 The Great 
Recession is only now very slowly 
abating for millions of this nation’s 
families, and “full employment” is 
forecasted finally to return sometime 
in 2017.3 In 2014, an estimated 
21.1% of children, or 15.5 million, 
lived in poverty.2
Although medical care and access to 
medical care are important factors 
in the health of children as well as 
adults, a broader perspective of 
the social determinants of health 
throughout the life cycle is critically 
important if significant gains are to 
be realized in our efforts to improve 
the health of this nation’s children. 
Research that examines mediators 
of health as well as the effects of 
poverty and other circumstances in 
which people grow, live, work, and 
age in childhood and throughout the 
life course is accumulating rapidly, 
and findings are providing critical 
insights that can inform these 
efforts.4
The environment in which a child 
develops is influenced by parents’ 
health, the immediate and extended 
family, housing, and community. All 
these factors are related to a family’s 
social, economic, and health status.5 
These multiple factors in both the 
social and the physical domains have 
dynamic influences that link them to 
the long-term physical and mental 
health of children, youth, and adults.6, 
7 The interaction of these factors that 
ultimately influence children’s health 
has been published as a figure within 
an earlier technical report from the 
American Academy of Pediatrics 
(AAP) on toxic stress.8 The ongoing 
investigation of these factors creates 
the basic science of pediatrics (Fig 1).
A 1958 birth cohort longitudinal 
study from the United Kingdom 
recently reported that 45-year-old 
adults who experienced psychological 
distress during childhood were at 
increased risk of adult cardiovascular 
and metabolic disease even if the 
distress resolved during adulthood.9 
Another recent study from Europe 
reviewed 201 studies from 32 
countries from all European regions. 
The investigators found that multiple 
social factors from different levels 
(eg, neighborhood, household) 
are sources of child health or 
development disadvantage. These 
findings support the necessity for 
effective interventions to target 
multiple social factors operating at 
different levels.10
The notion that development 
is affected by both biology and 
experience coactively is sometimes 
referred to as “canalization.” 
This idea is a major tenet of the 
psychobiological model of growth 
and development and provides 
a framework to understand why 
individuals do, or do not, develop 
specific sets of skills that reflect 
their genes as well as their life 
experiences.11 This concept is very 
similar to the ecobiodevelopmental 
framework proposed in the AAP 
policy statement and technical 
report on toxic stress.8, 
12 Although 
occasional stories appear of 
extraordinary disadvantaged youth 
who have overcome the myriad 
negative experiences of their 
childhood, for most children early 
adversity casts a long shadow into 
their adulthood and even into the 
next generation.13 This technical 
report provides an analysis of the 
current research on child poverty 
and mechanisms by which poverty 
and other factors associated with 
disadvantage influence the health and 
well-being of children. This report is 
especially appropriate immediately 
after the 50th anniversary year 
of President Johnson’s War on 
Poverty.14,

OVERVIEW OF POVERTY, RELATIONAL 
HEALTH, AND TOXIC STRESS
Poor families experience a plethora 
of stressful challenges that influence 
health.16 Housing and food insecurity 
are 2 examples of social determinants 
of health that contribute to health 
disparities in childhood.17, 
18 Poverty 
is an independent determinant of 
health through its adverse effect 
on family relationships, also called 
relational health.19 Relational health 
in early childhood is the ability 
to form secure attachments with 
engaged, responsive caregivers 
in a safe, stable, and nurturing 
emotional environment20; it is an 
essential protective factor for the 
development of emotional regulation 
and resilience and the ability to cope 
with adversity during an individual’s 
lifetime.21
Family relational processes can 
be affected by both biological and 
psychosocial pathways. For example, 
parents’ poverty-related stress can

The basic science of pediatrics. An emerging, 
multidisciplinary science of development 
supports an ecobiodevelopmental framework 
for understanding the evolution of human 
health and disease across the life span. In 
recent decades, epidemiology, developmental 
psychology, and longitudinal studies of 
early childhood interventions have shown 
signifi
 cant 
associations 
(dashed 
arrow) 
between the ecology of childhood and a wide 
range of developmental outcomes and life-
course trajectories. Concurrently, advances 
in the biological sciences, particularly in 
developmental neuroscience and epigenetics, 
have made parallel progress in beginning 
to elucidate the biological mechanisms 
(solid arrows) underlying these important 
associations. The convergence of these diverse 
disciplines defi
 nes a promising new basic 
science of pediatrics.

activate children’s stress mechanisms 
or children’s immune systems, 
and economic hardship has been 
associated with depressed parental 
mood and marital conflict.22
Poverty has direct negative effects 
on early brain development through 
the mechanism of toxic stress. The 
pathophysiology of toxic stress 
consists of frequent, unremitting 
activation of the hypothalamic-
pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis 
stress system and chronic elevation 
of cortisol as well as inflammatory 
mediators. The most common 
physiologic adaptive response to 
stress involves activation of the 
HPA axis and the sympathetic-
adrenomedullary system. This 
activation results in increased 
levels of stress hormones, such as 
corticotropin-releasing hormone, 
cortisol, norepinephrine, and 
adrenaline. These changes occur at 
the same time that other mediators 
are released, such as inflammatory 
cytokines.23, 
24 Although transient 
increases in these hormones are 
protective and may be necessary 
for survival, very high levels or 
prolonged exposures can be harmful 
and even toxic for the human 
body.25 The dysregulation of this 
combination of physiologic mediators 
(eg, too much or too little cortisol or 
inflammatory response) can create 
a “wear and tear” effect on a number 
of organs, including the brain.26 The 
overall stress-induced burden on 
body functioning and the aggregated 
physiologic and psychological costs 
required for coping and returning 
to homeostatic balance have been 
termed “allostatic load.”
The chronic stress of poverty during 
early childhood development 
is associated with an impaired 
ability of the prefrontal cortex to 
suppress the amygdala, the “on 
switch” for the stress response.27 
Prefrontal lobe dysfunction impairs 
executive control28 of affect 
regulation and impulsive behavior, 
and the epigenetic, anatomic, and 
neuroendocrine disruption related 
to chronic toxic stress may impair 
learning, behavior, and interpersonal 
relationships.29 This dysregulation 
adversely affects physical and mental 
illness throughout the life course. 
The combination of impaired self-
regulation and chronic stress may 
lead to maladaptive behaviors, 
such as smoking, excessive alcohol 
intake, overeating, promiscuity, and 
substance abuse, that transiently turn 
off the stress response but over the 
life course may cause morbidity and 
early mortality.30, 
31
In summary, poverty and other social 
determinants of health adversely 
affect relational health. Poor 
relational health, particularly the 
absence of emotional support by a 
nurturing adult, increases the risk of 
childhood toxic stress and difficulties 
in emotional regulation, early child 
development, and eventually, lifelong 
health. Prolonged activation of the 
body’s stress response becomes 
intolerable in the absence of the 
buffering effect of a supportive 
adult relationship.32 On the other 
hand, with good relational health 
and family stability, a child who 
experiences stress is more likely 
to turn off the physiologic stress 
response in a timely manner and 
avoid the adverse consequences.8, 
33 Programs focused on building 
self-regulation in impoverished 
children have been shown to improve 
executive function and decrease 
chronic stress.34 Thus, poverty-
related stress may be tolerable if 
good relational health is present as a 
protective factor. Recommendations 
made in the accompanying policy 
statement, 
35 “Poverty and Child 
Health in the United States, 
” are 
based on emerging research and 
evaluation findings that support the 
notion that the brain development 
of a child experiencing poverty and 
his or her health during the life 
course may be protected from harm 
by programs that foster improved 
parent engagement and relational 
health within the family and help to 
buffer the chronic stress of poverty.34, 
36
DEFINING AND DESCRIBING POVERTY 
IN THE UNITED STATES
Poverty is defined as a state in 
which one lacks a usual or socially 
acceptable amount of money or 
material possessions to provide for 
his or her basic needs, which typically 
include food, water, sanitation, 
clothing, shelter, health care, and 
education.37
Federal Poverty Level
In the United States, the current 
method of operationalizing and 
measuring poverty is called the 
federal poverty level (FPL). Each 
year, the US Department of Health 
and Human Services develops a set 
of poverty guidelines and thresholds 
on the basis of family size and family 
composition. These guidelines and 
thresholds are based on census data 
and are loosely referred to as the FPL. 
The income and demographic data 
for FPL estimates are collected within 
the Current Population Survey, an 
annual and nationally representative 
household survey jointly conducted 
by the US Census Bureau and the US 
Bureau of Labor Statistics within the 
US Department of Labor.
The FPL was developed in the early 
1960s on the basis of data from 
the US Department of Agriculture’s 
1955 Food Consumption Survey. 
That research in the 1950s found 
that the average US family spent 
one-third of its pretax income on 
food. By using the US Department of 
Agriculture’s Economy Food Plan, a 
bare-bones plan designed to provide 
a healthy diet for a temporary period 
when funds are low, the federal 
poverty measure was determined by 
multiplying the budget for the basic 
food plan by 3.
The federal poverty measure has not 
changed fundamentally since 1969, 
except that it is adjusted annually 
e3

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
for overall food price inflation, as 
measured by the Consumer Price 
Index. Thus, the FPL reflects 1950s 
living standards and has not been 
adjusted to reflect changes in needs 
associated with the dramatic increase 
in 2-parent working families and 
the improvement in the standards 
of living that have occurred over 
the past 45 years, which have 
significantly changed the composition 
of the family budget. Food now 
accounts for approximately 15% 
of the budget, and the proportion 
allocated to work-related costs, child 
care, housing, and transportation 
has increased substantially. If the 
same methodology of the basic food 
basket were applied today, the FPL 
would be more than 2 times higher 
than the current level.38 However, 
it is also important to note that the 
FPL does not take into consideration 
government cash or near-cash 
subsidies, such as the Supplemental 
Nutrition Assistance Program 
(SNAP), the Special Supplemental 
Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants, and Children (WIC), housing 
subsidies, low-income home energy 
assistance, or earned income and 
child tax credits. The FPL also does 
not account for variations in medical 
costs across population groups or 
geographic differences in the cost 
of living. To account for geographic 
variations in the cost of living and to 
include income-transfer programs 
listed above, in 2010 the National 
Academy of Sciences39 conducted a 
study of current family budgets and 
developed the Supplemental Poverty 
Measure (SPM).40
Individuals and families living below 
the FPL are referred to as “poor” (in 
2014, this was $15 379 for a 2-person 
family and $24 230 for a family of 4).2 
Research suggests that, on average, 
families need an income equal to at 
least 2 times the FPL to meet their 
basic needs.41 Families with incomes 
up to 200% of the FPL are referred 
to as “low income” ($48 460 for a 
family of 4). Families at 50% of the 
FPL are considered to be living in 
“deep poverty”; in 2014, 9.3% of 
children younger than 18 years in the 
United States lived in deep poverty, 
representing 32.7% of people living 
in deep poverty (Table 1).2
Family income is not the only, or 
perhaps best, indicator of poverty. 
Family wealth, defined as the total 
value of family assets such as housing, 
monetary savings, investments, etc, 
may be a more important measure 
of both family financial stability and 
the capacity to sufficiently provide 
for children. The wealth gap has 
widened significantly since the recent 
economic downturn. In 1995, the 
disparity of median household wealth 
(net assets) between white families 
and for both black and Hispanic 
families was 7:1. By 2009, at the end 
of the Great Recession, the median 
household wealth for white families 
was 18 times that for Hispanic 
families and 20 times that for black 
families.42 Other measures of financial 
status or stability include measures 
of educational achievement, quality of 
housing, and stability of employment, 
all of which contribute to quality of life 
more directly than does a moderate 
increase in income or net wealth.43
Challenges With the Poverty 
Measures
Current poverty measures all have 
inherent difficulties, and attempts 
have been made to compensate for 
them. For example, these measures 
are point-in-time or prevalence 
measures of poverty. However, 
individual and family poverty 
and deprivation are not static; 
family income changes over time. 
Moreover, poverty and deprivation 
most strongly affect children and 
families over time. To measure 
the longitudinal dimension of 
poverty, researchers use recurring 
surveys, such as the Panel Study of 
Income Dynamics, 
44 a nationally 
representative survey that 
interviewed respondents (including 
families with children) annually 
from 1968 to 1997 and biennially 
thereafter.45
Another problem with a federal 
measure of poverty is that the cost 
of living varies significantly by 
region. In 2012, the estimated cost 
of meeting a family’s basic needs 
for a family of 4 was approximately 
$64 000 per year in Los Angeles, 
California; $57 000 in Newark, New 
Jersey; $46 000 in Indianapolis, 
Indiana; and $42 000 in Jackson, 
Mississippi.46 This variation is not 
taken into account by the FPL but is 
taken into account by the SPM. As a 
result, in high-cost areas (eg, New 
Jersey, California), the SPM indicates 
higher poverty rates than does the 
FPL, and in lower-cost areas (eg, 
Mississippi) the SPM indicates lower 
poverty rates than does the FPL.38
PREVALENCE AND CHARACTERISTICS

STATES
By using the FPL, the percentage of 
children younger than 18 years living 
in poverty declined significantly

during the 1950s and 1960s, 
47 but 
from the mid-1970s until 2010 the 
proportion of children living in 
poverty increased, rising strongly 
during economic recessions and 
declining modestly during periods 
of economic growth.38 From 2007 to 
2010, the percentage of children in 
poverty increased from 18% to 22%, 
an increase of 3 million children 
living in poverty. From 2010 to 2014, 
the child poverty rate was stable 
and did not appreciably increase or 
decline.2, 
48 In 2014, 9.3% of children 
lived in extreme poverty, with their 
families earning less than 50% of the 
FPL.2, 
49, 
50
Demographics
Age.
Younger children are more likely to 
be poor or low income than are older 
children. In 2013, 25% of children 
from birth to 5 years of age were 
poor and 48% were low income, 
compared with adolescents, 19% of 
whom were poor and 41% of whom 
were low income.51, 
52 In other words, 
poverty and low income have the 
highest prevalence among the most 
vulnerable members of our society 
during the most critical time in their 
development.
Race, Ethnicity, and Immigrant Status.
Race and ethnicity are particularly 
strong determinants of both 
individual- and community-level 
poverty. In 2014, 12.3% of white 
children and 13.4% of Asian children 
lived below poverty level, compared 
with 37.1% of black children and 
31.9% of Hispanic children.2 In 2013, 
25.8% of children in the United States 
had at least 1 immigrant parent. 
The poverty rate among children 
of immigrant parents in 2013 was 
28.4%.53
Parental Education.
Higher levels of parental education 
decrease the likelihood that a child 
will live in a low-income or poor 
family. Among children with at 
least 1 parent with some college or 
additional education, 13% are poor 
and 31% are low income. By contrast, 
among children whose parents have 
less than a high school degree, 57% 
are poor and 86% are low income.46
Parental Employment Status.
Children with a parent who is 
employed full-time, year-round are 
less likely to live in poor families than 
are children with parents who work 
part-time or part of the year or who 
are not employed. Of children with 
1 parent who works full-time, year-
round, 9% are poor and 31% are low 
income. In contrast, of children in 
families with no parent who works 
full-time, 48% are poor and 74% are 
low income. It is important to note 
that almost half (49%) of low-income 
children and 28% of poor children 
have at least 1 parent employed full-
time, year-round.44, 
46
Family Structure.
Single-parent families are more 
than 4 times more likely to be poor 
than are 2-parent families.48 Among 
all single female-headed families, 
42% are poor and 69% are low 
income compared with 12% and 
32%, respectively, for 2-parent 
families.46 A major contributor 
to poverty in the United States is 
the increase in the proportion of 
children who live in single-parent 
families. In 1960, 87.8% of children 
were living in 2-parent families, 
compared with 64.4% in 2014.54 
The absence of fathers in the home 
is associated with a fourfold risk of 
poverty. Children of single mothers 
are also at greater risk of infant 
mortality, child maltreatment, failure 
to graduate from high school, and 
incarceration.55, 
56
Children being raised by same-
sex parents are twice as likely to 
live in poverty, compared with 
children living in households with 
heterosexual parents.47, 
57 The 
average household income for 
families headed by same-sex parents 
is 20% lower than that of families 
headed by heterosexual parent 
couples.57, 
58 Moreover, only 51% 
of same-sex parent couples with 
children own their homes, compared 
with 71% of married heterosexual 
parent couples with children. A 
higher proportion of same-sex parent 
couples raising children live in states 
with high poverty rates: Mississippi, 
Wyoming, Alaska, Arkansas, Texas, 
Louisiana, Oklahoma, Kansas, 
Alabama, Montana, South Dakota, 
and South Carolina. In the past, 
because of limited federal and state 
recognition of spousal relationships 
between same-sex couples, families 
headed by same-sex couples were 
denied access to many family-income 
support programs.58 However, 
recent Supreme Court decisions 
invalidating section 3 of the Defense 
of Marriage Act (which provided 
federal definitions of marriage that 
precluded federal recognition of 
same-sex marriages)59, 
60 and the June 
26, 2015, Supreme Court decision 
(Obergefell et al v Hodges) upholding 
the legality of marriage between 
same-sex couples should improve 
access to federal income-support 
programs for same-sex married 
couples.61
Geography
The overall national child poverty 
estimates mask important geographic 
variation in poverty across states, 
cities, and neighborhoods. In 2014, 
the percentage of children living 
in poverty ranged from 13% in 
Maryland, New Hampshire, Utah, and 
Wyoming to 30% in New Mexico. As 
shown in Fig 2, the southern states 
have higher levels of child poverty 
than do the northern states.62 More 
substantial variation in community 
poverty exists among large and 
small cities and neighborhoods. 
Among large metropolitan regions, 
the prevalence of poverty rates 
varies from a high of 36% (eg, 
McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas, 
and Fresno, California) to a low of

8% (eg, Washington, DC-Arlington/
Alexandria, Virginia, and Bridgeport-
Stamford-Norwalk, Connecticut). 
At the neighborhood level, poverty 
can be even more concentrated in 
particular areas. More than 4% of 
children live in neighborhoods of 
very concentrated poverty, defined 
as neighborhoods in which ≥40% 
of households are poor. Twenty 
percent of children live in “poverty 
areas, 
” defined as neighborhoods in 
which 20% to 39% of households are 
poor.63
Black, Hispanic, and American 
Indian/Alaska Native children are 
more likely to live in neighborhoods 
of concentrated poverty than are 
either Asian or white non-Hispanic 
children. Almost two-thirds of black, 
Hispanic, and American Indian/
Alaska Native children live in areas 
of concentrated poverty, compared 
with one-third of white children.38 
As the severity of poverty in areas 
increases, the disproportionate 
representation of black, Hispanic, 
and American Indian/Alaska Native 
families and children increases to 
between 33% and 43%, compared 
with only 14% for white families.38 
Consistent with these data, recent 
studies show that residential 
segregation by income has increased 
over the past 30 years. The analysis 
found that 28% of lower-income 
households in 2010 were located 
in a majority lower-income census 
tract, up from 23% in 1980, and that 
18% of upper-income households 
were located in a majority upper-
income census tract, up from 
9% in 1980.46, 
64 That is, poverty 
and wealth are becoming more 
concentrated in very different 
neighborhoods.
An additional aspect of the 
geography of child poverty is that 
rural poverty rates have been 
historically higher than urban 
poverty rates, and rural poverty 
has increased more substantially in 
recent years, to 26.7% compared 
with 20.9% for metropolitan areas.65 
Since 2008, city suburbs have 
experienced the fastest growth in 
poverty of any population area. 
Children living in neighborhoods 
and communities characterized 
by concentrated poverty are more 
frequently exposed to environmental 
toxins, poorly performing schools 
and child care settings, community 
violence, and fewer community and 
social supports. The accumulation 
of multiple environmental risks 
found in areas of concentrated 
poverty undermines the healthy 
development of children.66 
Therefore, poor and minority 
children are in double jeopardy 
because of the lack of resources 
within their own families and the 
exposure to detrimental influences 
or lack of social supports in areas 
of concentrated poverty in urban, 
suburban, and rural areas.
Timing and Duration
Investigators from the Urban 
Institute studied the duration and 
severity of poverty among a sample 
of children over an interval of 18 
years using data from the Panel 
Study of Income Dynamics. They 
found that 10% of children were 
persistently poor (more than 9 years) 
and another 10% were poor for 4 to 
8 years. Persistent poverty differed 
significantly by race. Approximately 
37% of black children were poor for 
more than 9 years of their childhood, 
whereas 5% of white children were 
persistently poor.67 Children who 
experience poverty also tend to cycle 
into and out of poverty, and even 
the most persistently poor children 
spend intermittent years living above 
the FPL. The investigators also found 
that being poor at birth is a strong 
predictor of future poverty status: 
31% of white children and 69% of 
black children who are poor at birth

go on to spend at least half their 
childhood living in poverty.
Another important observation 
is that the effects of poverty are 
cumulative, and poverty in 1 
period of a child’s life hinders 
development in another stage or 
even into adulthood.68 Shonkoff and 
colleagues5 asserted that a “scientific 
consensus” has evolved on the origins 
of adult disease as a direct result of 
childhood adverse experiences and 
that childhood adverse experiences 
affect adult health either through 
“cumulative damage” or “biological 
embedding of adversities” that are 
related to adult disease.
THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF POVERTY
Toxic Stress
An important concept in 
understanding the well-documented 
childhood gradient of morbidity 
and mortality is “toxic stress, 
” a concept related to the change 
in stress hormones in response 
to experience over time.69 For 
challenges of limited duration, 
the body’s response is twofold: 
turning on a response that initiates 
a complex hormonal pathway and 
then shutting it off as the challenge 
resolves. The most common 
response involves the sympathetic 
nervous system and the HPA axis. 
Catecholamines are released from 
nerves and the adrenal medulla that 
stimulate a cascade within the HPA 
axis that results in the secretion 
of adrenocorticotropin from the 
pituitary gland. Adrenocorticotropin 
hormone stimulates cortisol 
secretion by the adrenal cortex. 
Although the immune-enhancing 
effects of acute stress have been 
observed to last 3 to 5 days, during 
the state of toxic stress the delayed 
hypersensitivity response is 
substantially blunted. When stress 
is chronic and continuous, such as 
the stress associated with chronic 
poverty, response systems, including 
the HPA axis and the sympathetic 
adrenal system, are on “high alert.” 
As a result, stress hormones, such as 
cortisol, are relatively high.
Appropriately labeled “a biology 
of misfortune” by Boyce, 
70 the 
observation about toxic stress 
described above is supported by 
2 recent studies. The Family Life 
Project was designed to follow 
young children and their families 
with high levels of poverty in 
eastern North Carolina and central 
Pennsylvania from the index child’s 
birth through 4 years of age.71 A 
representative sample of 1292 
children were selected and home 
visited at approximately 7, 15, 24, 
36, and 48 months of age. Salivary 
cortisol samples were collected at 
each home visit. During the first 4 
years of the study, the statistically 
significant predictors of higher 
cortisol levels were black race, 
poor-quality housing, and 2 or more 
adults leaving the home before the 
index child’s fourth birthday. Older 
children were studied by Evans and 
Kim, 
72 who monitored overnight 
urinary cortisol concentrations to 
assess “chronic physiologic stress.” 
Children were assessed in wave 1 
at approximately 8 years of age and 
in wave 2 at 13 years of age with 
12-hour overnight urinary free 
cortisol samples. After controlling 
for urinary cortisol concentrations 
in wave 1, urinary cortisol 
concentrations in wave 2 were 
significantly related to duration of 
family poverty. In addition, more 
time living in poverty for children 
aged 13 years old was related to 
a more attenuated cardiovascular 
response to an acute stressor. This 
pattern of chronic elevated HPA 
axis activity, muted cardiovascular 
response, and a gradient of 
cumulative risk for children living 
in poverty corroborates the findings 
of a large longitudinal British study 
that found the self-reported health 
of study participants aged 23 years 
old was related to a number of risk 
factors that began in childhood.73
Chronic Infl
 ammation
Another biological process that may 
have a direct effect on the negative 
health outcomes observed in adults 
who experienced child poverty is 
chronic inflammation. Ziol-Guest 
et al74 reported on a nationally 
representative sample of adults from 
the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. 
Adult study subjects (30–41 years of 
age) who experienced child poverty 
were more likely to report arthritis 
or hypertension and limitations in 
daily activities compared with adults 
who did not experience child poverty. 
Although the investigators noted the 
lack of direct measures of immune 
function in their study, earlier work 
has described a link between low 
social class early in life and chronic 
inflammation.75 Facilitated by other 
exposures and genetic liabilities, 
chronic inflammation drives the 
pathogenic mechanisms that 
ultimately result in chronic disease.76 
In addition, animal research in 
mice has identified upregulation of 
inflammatory gene expression in the 
presence of social stress.77
THE ENVIRONMENT OF POVERTY
Children growing up in low-
income families and low-income 
neighborhoods face a daunting array 
of psychosocial and environmental 
inequities that undermine their 
healthy development. The exposure 
to multiple stressors may be a 
unique, critically important feature 
of the environment of children 
growing up in poverty. Compared 
with their economically advantaged 
counterparts, children living in poor 
families and poor neighborhoods 
are exposed to more family turmoil, 
violence, and separation from 
their families.65 Children from 
low-income families hear fewer 
words between age 1 and 3 years 
and the context of the language to 
which they are exposed is more 
negative and punitive compared 
with higher-income families.78 More 
e7

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
than one-quarter of poor children 
(28%) live in families with divorced 
or separated parents compared 
with less than 5% of children in 
the highest income group.79 Almost 
half (45%) of children with single 
mothers live in poverty, compared 
with 13% of children from 2-parent 
families.80 Low-income children also 
are much more likely to experience 
housing instability and multiple 
moves.81, 
82 The physical environment 
of low-income children is more 
hazardous than that of higher-
income children, because they are 
exposed more frequently to pollution, 
lower-quality homes, and dangerous 
neighborhoods.83
Unintentional Injuries and Child 
Maltreatment
Although mortality among US 
children has decreased over the 
past 15 years, injury and violence 
still account for nearly 50% of all 
childhood deaths after the first 
birthday.84 Children from the lowest 
socioeconomic stratum have a death 
rate from unintentional injuries 
that is 5 times that of children from 
higher socioeconomic strata. Poor 
families are more likely to reside in 
homes without functional smoke 
detectors and with open fires, 
unprotected windows, and unsafe 
roofs or stairs. They may live close 
to dense, fast-moving traffic and 
lack safe areas in which to play.85 
Children in poor neighborhoods are 
at increased risk of cycling accidents, 
pedestrian injuries, falls, burns, 
poisonings, and chemical burns.86 
If children in the least healthy 
communities experienced mortality 
rates from unintentional injuries and 
homicide similar to those of the most 
resource-rich communities, overall 
US child mortality would decrease by 
one-third.87
Injuries from child maltreatment 
and developmental consequences 
of neglect also are risks for poor 
children. Recent survey data confirm 
that both poverty and income 
inequality are positively associated 
with the rates of protective service 
referrals for child maltreatment.88 
Within families, poverty is associated 
with intimate partner violence, 
maternal depression, single-parent 
families, and parental substance 
abuse, all of which are risk factors 
for child maltreatment.89 In 1998, 
Felitti et al90 published the Adverse 
Childhood Experiences (ACE) 
Study, a landmark study that linked 
adverse childhood experiences, 
including childhood maltreatment, 
and mortality in adults. A recent 
study88 corroborated the association 
between child poverty and child 
maltreatment at the county level 
for each of the 3142 counties in the 
United States. Child maltreatment is 
a global problem91 that has a well-
documented association with later 
negative physical and mental health 
outcomes in adults.92 Although toxic 
stress has a role in the association 
between child maltreatment and 
later mental and physical health 
problems, 
93 posttraumatic cognition 
(eg, an individual’s appraisal or 
interpretation of the traumatic 
event or events) is another 
putative mediator.94 Posttraumatic 
cognitions may act to either 
attenuate the adverse effects of child 
maltreatment or prevent healthy 
coping. Dysfunctional posttraumatic 
cognitions may lead to poorer health 
outcomes for the victims of child 
maltreatment.95
ADVERSE PSYCHOSOCIAL AND 
ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS OF POVERTY 
AND LOW INCOME ON CHILDREN
Inadequate Housing and 
Neighborhoods
Place matters. Where a child lives 
contributes to health disparities 
and predicts health inequities.96 
In addition to experiencing food 
insecurity, poor families may have 
difficulty maintaining adequate 
housing, heat, and utilities. In 2011, 
more than 45% of all households 
with children reported housing 
problems, including multiple moves, 
overcrowding, and physically 
inadequate housing as well as 
inability to pay the rent.97 An 
estimated 1.6 million American 
children experienced homelessness 
in 2010.98 Household energy security 
(ie, the costs of home heating, 
cooling, and utilities) can present 
a constant struggle for low-income 
families. Researchers at the pediatric 
research center Children’s Health 
Watch have identified energy 
insecurity as a risk to child health 
that is often found among families 
who are also food insecure.99, 
100
Poverty affects where and how 
families live. Housing options 
are often limited to urban areas 
with crowding, violence, and lack 
of safety; to rural areas that are 
isolated and lack social support66, 
101; or to suburban neighborhoods 
that are either ethnic enclaves 
or affected by foreclosures and 
deteriorating housing stock. A large 
body of research has documented the 
relationship between neighborhood 
conditions and health.102 For 
example, poverty is a risk factor for 
lead exposure in the home, and poor 
black children are twice as likely as 
poor Hispanic and white children to 
have concentrations of lead in their 
blood of at least 2.5 μg/dL (33% vs 
17% and 13%, respectively).103, 
104 
There is an interaction between race 
and poverty, and not all poor children 
have the same experience. It appears 
that poor black children are more 
likely to be exposed to lead than poor 
children from other races.
Poor neighborhoods expose families 
to a variety of barriers and harms. 
Poor families often face elevated 
levels of crime, violence, and toxic 
exposure inherited from the days of 
racial segregation, now referred to as 
spatial racism, when communities of 
color were targeted for diminished 
resources and toxic industry. Areas 
of concentrated poverty also may 
lack quality schools, sustainable jobs,

health care facilities, safe recreation 
spaces, and other resources that 
support healthy community 
activities.105, 
106
Limited Access to Developmentally 
Appropriate Experiences and High-
Quality Educational Opportunities
Poor families may have difficulty 
obtaining resources that support 
child development and provide a 
nurturing and stimulating home 
environment. Data from the National 
Longitudinal Survey of Youth indicate 
that children in poor households 
have less access to learning materials 
and experiences, including books, 
stimulating toys, skill-building 
lessons, and other enriching 
experiences.107
In addition to individual family 
characteristics, funding and 
resources for schools make a 
difference in achievement. Forty-
three percent of public school 
principals reported that the condition 
of their school facility interfered 
with classroom instruction.108 
Smaller class size, which requires 
more money, has been shown to 
produce lasting gains, particularly 
for economically disadvantaged 
students.109 School funding formulas 
vary by state but are often dependent 
on property taxes, which can 
exacerbate economic disparities 
between communities. Unless the 
state has a formula that equalizes 
resources, poor communities tend to 
have less to spend per pupil than do 
wealthier communities. In 1 study, 
communities with 22% of students 
in poverty spent one-third as much 
per pupil as communities with 6% 
of students in poverty ($4000 vs 
$13 000 annually).110
Suboptimal Nutrition
Food insecurity is defined as 
limited or uncertain availability 
of nutritionally adequate and safe 
foods.111 An estimated 20% of 
households with children in the 
United States experienced food 
insecurity during 2013.112 The rate 
of food insecurity for children living 
in poverty is nearly 40%.113 Although 
children are often shielded from very 
low food security, in approximately 
10% of households with children 
(more than 3.9 million households), 
children did not have access to 
adequate, nutritious food at some 
time during the year. Food insecurity 
has a significant effect on both 
physical and cognitive development, 
because the lack of adequate, 
nutritious food increases the 
likelihood of iron-deficiency anemia, 
lower academic achievement, and 
behavioral problems.114
Paradoxically, US children from 
the poorest communities have the 
highest rates of obesity.115, 
116 In fact, 
children from poor families are 7 
times as likely to be obese as they 
are to be underweight.117 The origins 
of this obesity paradox are likely 
multifactorial but may stem from 
the fact that foods high in calories, 
fats, and added sugars tend to cost 
less than do nutrient-dense foods, 
and many low-income families face 
challenges in obtaining high-quality, 
nutritious foods.
EFFECTS OF POVERTY
Infant Mortality, Adolescent 
Pregnancy, and Low Birth Weight
Higher infant mortality rates 
among the impoverished have been 
recognized as a societal problem in 
the United States for 140 years.118 
Children in the poorest 20% of urban 
populations in the United States are 
twice as likely to die before their first 
birthday compared with children in 
the richest 20% of the population.119 
The risk of teen pregnancy increases 
10-fold for the lowest income level 
compared with the highest, 
120 and 
teen pregnancy increases the risk of 
remaining in poverty in the future.121
Low birth weight is often used as a 
marker for infant and child outcomes 
and has been found to be a leading 
predictor of first-year mortality 
risk.122 The increased risk of low 
birth weight in poor neighborhoods 
is associated with a high prevalence 
of teen pregnancy and inadequate 
prenatal care.123 Low birth 
weight also may be related to the 
development of adult illness through 
epigenetic adaptation to intrauterine 
nutritional deficiencies (Barker 
hypothesis).124
Delayed Growth and Development
The effects of poverty on both growth 
and development manifest in early 
infancy. For example, low-income 
children have measurable gaps in 
language development beginning at 
the time of their first words, resulting 
in substantial differences in school 
readiness.78 These differences may 
be mediated by aspects of the early 
home environments, including less 
reading aloud by parents and more 
exposure to electronic media.125 
The influence of poverty on physical 
growth also can be measured in early 
childhood. According to the 2009 
Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 
Survey, 6% of children qualifying for 
federal nutritional assistance from 
birth to age 4 years were of short 
stature, compared with 3.7% of all US 
children of the same age.116
Chronic Conditions
In addition to the high rate of obesity, 
poor children 6 to 18 years of age 
are more likely to be sedentary and 
exposed to tobacco when compared 
with their wealthiest counterparts, 
which may increase the risk of 
cardiovascular and pulmonary 
disease as adults.126 Low family 
income during the first 2 years of life 
is associated with a twofold increase 
in the rate of hypertension in early 
adulthood.74
Chronic poverty also is associated 
with increased frequency of asthma 
attacks as well as worse overall 
health status reported by parents.127, 
128 The neighborhood in which 
e9

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
the family lives has a particularly 
strong effect on the prevalence of 
asthma, with asthma occurring much 
more frequently in neighborhoods 
with predominantly poor and 
nonwhite populations than in those 
with higher-income and white 
populations.129 Characteristics of 
poor neighborhoods associated with 
the increase in asthma morbidity 
include crowding, air pollution, 
dampness, and the presence of 
pests.130
Untreated early childhood caries are 
2.5 times more common in children 
in poor families than in families 
with incomes above the FPL. The 
application of dental sealants and 
the rate of visits to a dentist are also 
lower for poor children.131
Compromised Mental Health, 
Behavioral Health, and Relational 
Development
Children raised in poverty have 
been shown to have higher levels of 
depression and antisocial behavioral 
problems than those raised in 
families with adequate incomes. 
Depression in poor children younger 
than 18 years has been linked to 
substance abuse, poor academic 
performance, teen childbearing, and 
unemployment.132 Poor children also 
are more likely to be diagnosed with 
conduct disorders133 and attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder.134 
Substance abuse, including alcohol 
and tobacco, is higher for poor 
adolescents, increasing the risk of 
emphysema and cirrhosis as well 
as cancer.135 Parental depression 
and anxiety are common in low-
income families and associated with 
well-documented adverse effects on 
children’s relational and emotional 
development.136–138
Poor Academic Progress
Many observational studies confirm 
the link between low socioeconomic 
status and poor achievement 
in school, both in primary and 
secondary education.139 This 
association is mediated by factors 
such as school violence, 
140 family 
structure, 
141 parental involvement at 
school, 
142 and parental involvement 
in education at home.143 Early 
intervention is critically important in 
this domain, because the disparities 
between poor and nonpoor children 
are already apparent at school 
entry.144
Data from 2013 revealed that 89% 
of fourth-grade students from low-
income families read below the 
proficiency level, compared with 
49% of students from higher-income 
families.145 The national high school 
drop-out rate is 7.4% for low-
income students and 1.4% for high-
income students.146 For students 
taking the SAT in 2012, students 
from families at or below the FPL 
averaged in the 30th percentile 
on reading and students from 
families with incomes greater than 
$200 000/year scored in the 70th 
percentile.147
Studies that used functional MRI 
have shown that socioeconomic 
factors are associated with brain-
behavior relationships in the 
acquisition of reading skills.148 A 
longitudinal study that included 
multiple MRIs on 389 typically 
developing children found that 
childhood poverty was associated 
with structural differences in several 
areas of the brain important in the 
development of school readiness 
skills. The most significant changes 
were observed in children from 
the poorest families.149 Adequate 
nutrition; a quiet, safe, toxin-free 
environment; and the effective, 
timely detection and treatment of 
chronic childhood health conditions 
are all factors that enable children to 
arrive at school each morning ready 
and able to learn.129 Several putative 
mediators are well established in the 
relationship between poverty and 
school underachievement. Almost 17 
million children are from families “at 
risk” of going hungry, 
150 and even 
intermittent food insufficiency in 
low-income children is associated 
with a number of adverse academic 
outcomes, including poor scores on 
achievement tests, grade repetition, 
and absenteeism, compared with 
children who are never hungry. 
In addition, chronic high-noise 
environments and exposure to 
indoor air pollution, especially 
passive smoking, have been 
associated with decreased academic 
performance. It is estimated that 
asthma accounts for approximately 
10 million days of school missed 
each year, 3 times the amount of 
missed school for children without 
a chronic health condition.151 In 
a recent analysis of data from the 
National Center for Health Statistics 
(2009–2011), asthma prevalence 
was associated with both urban and 
nonurban poverty.152
TRACKING IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS
Compared with the International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision, Clinical Modification, 
the International Classification of 
Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical 
Modification (ICD-10-CM)153 provides 
a more robust classification system 
that enables clinicians to track 
socioeconomic factors in patient 
care that may be related to families’ 
annual income level. By using the 
ICD-10-CM, child health clinicians 
can submit supplemental codes 
for their patient care that include 
not only diagnosis, such as acute 
asthma exacerbation, but additional 
socioeconomic factors related to the 
asthma exacerbation and treatment, 
such as childhood poverty or the 
family’s inability to afford the 
recommended medical regimen. 
It will be important to capture 
this additional socioeconomic 
information with the use of ICD-
10-CM codes to enable investigators 
to examine the putative impact of 
expanded codes on children’s 
health care.

CONCLUSIONS
Knowledge about the effects of 
poverty on children and their 
development has increased 
dramatically since Brooks-Gunn 
and Duncan’s often cited (over 
65 000 citations) landmark study 
in 1997.154 In the 21st century, Sir 
Michael Marmot has emerged as a 
global leader in studying the social 
determinants of health. Since 2005, 
Marmot has led the World Health 
Organization’s Commission on Social 
Determinants of Health.155 His 2009 
article published in the Journal of 
the American Medical Association156 
noted that a global mortality gradient 
exists among poor and rich countries. 
Evidence supports the hypothesis 
that the slope of a health gradient is 
not fixed but responds to political, 
social, and economic changes.157
Research is rapidly accumulating 
that refines our understanding of 
the mediators of poverty’s adverse 
effects on children and adults and 
informs the implementation of 
effective interventions to ameliorate 
poverty’s adverse effects.158 For 
example, recent research has strongly 
suggested that stress related to child 
poverty may be buffered by parent 
engagement and good relational 
health. The AAP policy statement that 
accompanies this technical report 
describes specific recommendations 
and population health strategies that 
could attenuate the adverse effects 
of child poverty and address many 
of the mediators of poverty that 
affect child health and development. 
Addressing the immediate needs of 
our youngest and poorest citizens 
is both the right thing to do for our 
children and an economically sound 
strategy for the future.159
