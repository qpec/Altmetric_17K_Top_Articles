IMPORTANCE Depression has been identified as a risk factor for dementia. However, most
studies have measured depressive symptoms at only one time point, and older adults may
show different patterns of depressive symptoms over time.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between trajectories of depressive symptoms and
risk of dementia in older adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a prospective cohort investigation of black and
white community-dwelling older adults in the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study.
Participants were enrolled between May 1997 and June 1998 and followed up through
2001-2002. The dates of this analysis were September 2014 to December 2015. The setting
was community research centers in Memphis, Tennessee, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Trajectories of depressive symptoms were assessed from baseline to year 5. Symptoms were
measured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale Short Form, and
trajectories were calculated using latent class growth curve analysis.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident dementia through year 11, determined by
dementia medication use, hospital records, or significant cognitive decline (�1.5 SD
race-specific decline on the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination). We examined the
association between depressive symptom trajectories and dementia incidence using Cox
proportional hazards regression models adjusted for demographics, health factors that
differed between groups, and cognition during the depressive symptom assessment period
(baseline to year 5).
RESULTS The analytic cohort included 2488 black and white older adults with repeated
depressive symptom assessments from baseline to year 5 who were free of dementia
throughout that period. Their mean (SD) age at baseline was 74.0 (2.8) years, and 53.1%
(n = 1322) were female. The following 3 depressive symptom trajectories were identified:
consistently minimal symptoms (62.0% [n = 1542] of participants), moderate and increasing
symptoms (32.2% [n = 801] of participants), and high and increasing symptoms (5.8%
[n = 145] of participants). Compared with the consistently minimal trajectory, having a high
and increasing depressive symptom trajectory was associated with significantly increased risk
of dementia (fully adjusted hazard ratio, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.30-2.90), while the moderate and
increasing trajectory was not associated with risk of dementia after full adjustment.
Sensitivity analyses indicated that the high and increasing trajectory was associated with
dementia incidence, while depressive symptoms at individual time points were not.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Older adults with a longitudinal pattern of high and increasing
depressive symptoms are at high risk for dementia. Individuals’trajectory of depressive
symptoms may inform dementia risk more accurately than one-time assessment of
depressive symptoms.

T
he relationship between depression and cognition in ag-
ing is complex, with evidence supporting different tem-
poralassociationsbetweendepressivesymptomsandthe
onset of cognitive decline and dementia.1 Some studies2,3 sug-
gest older adults may develop depressive symptoms in reac-
tion to experiencing cognitive decline, other researchers iden-
tifydepressionasariskfactorfordementia,4andotherstheorize
that depressive symptoms and cognitive decline may both be
symptoms of an underlying neurodegenerative process.5
Most studies investigating the association between de-
pressive symptoms and development of dementia have been
limited by measuring depressive symptoms at only one time
point. This approach does not capture intraindividual vari-
ability in symptoms or the longitudinal course of depressive
symptoms,whichmaybeparticularlyimportantbecauseolder
individuals appear to experience different patterns of depres-
sive symptoms over time.6-8 For example, a study7 of older
women followed up for approximately 20 years showed that
individuals tended to exhibit the following 4 longitudinal pat-
terns of depressive symptoms: trajectories of “minimal,
” “per-
sistently low,” “increasing,” and “persistently high” symp-
toms. It remains unclear whether different trajectories of
depressive symptoms confer differential risk for dementia.
Weinvestigatedtheassociationbetweentrajectoriesofde-
pressive symptoms and risk of dementia among black and
white older adults followed up prospectively in the Health, Ag-
ing, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study. We hypoth-
esized that individuals with particularly deleterious depres-
sive symptom trajectories (eg, increasing or persistently high
symptoms) would be most likely to develop dementia. We also
investigated whether the effect of depressive symptom tra-
jectoriesondementiariskdifferedbysex,race,orAPOE(OMIM

mentia beyond that captured by one-time assessment of de-
pressive symptoms.

For the present study, we investigated whether depres-
sivesymptomtrajectoriesfrombaseline(year1)toyear5(1997-
1998through2001-2002)wereassociatedwithsubsequentde-
velopment of dementia through year 11 (2007-2008). This
analysis time line (Figure 1) was specified to assess depres-
sive symptom trajectories over approximately the first half of
the study and investigate whether these trajectories were as-
sociated with development of dementia during later years. Be-
cause we aimed to characterize longitudinal patterns of de-
pressive symptoms from baseline to year 5, we excluded
participants with fewer than 2 depression assessments dur-
ing that interval (193 individuals met this criteria). To inves-
tigate whether depressive symptom trajectories were associ-
ated with later development of dementia, we excluded
participants who met criteria for dementia during the depres-
sive symptom assessment period (142 individuals met this cri-
teria), and we also excluded participants who did not com-
plete the year 5 visit or have follow-up for dementia after year
5 (432 individuals met these criteria). After these exclusions,
the analytic cohort consisted of 2488 participants (mean [SD]
age at baseline, 74.0 [2.8] years; 38.4% [n = 956] black; and
53.1% [n = 1322] female), who had a mean (SD) of 3.9 (0.3) de-
pression assessments between baseline and year 5 and a mean
(SD) of 4.9 (1.9) years of follow-up for dementia after year 5.

Key Points
Question: Are different trajectories of depressive symptoms in
older adults associated with risk of dementia?
Findings: In this prospective cohort study of 2488 older adults,
a trajectory of high and increasing depressive symptoms was
associated with significantly increased risk of dementia even when
accounting for other factors and severity of depressive symptoms
measured at single time points.
Meaning: Older adults who exhibit a pattern of chronically high
and increasing depressive symptoms over time may be at higher
risk of subsequently developing dementia.

were repeatedly administered the Modified Mini-Mental State
Examination (3MS),20 a cognitive screening measure that as-
sesses orientation, concentration, language, praxis, and imme-
diate and delayed memory. The 3MS, with a score range of 0 to
100points,hasbeenshowntobemoresensitiveindetectingde-
mentia than other cognitive screening instruments.21
Dementia incidence was determined based on a combi-
nation of criteria, with the date of dementia onset defined as
the date a participant first met any of the following criteria:
(1) record of hospitalization indicating dementia as a primary
or secondary diagnosis, (2) record of a prescription for demen-
tia medication (eg, galantamine hydrobromide, rivastigmine,
memantine hydrochloride, donepezil hydrochloride, or ta-
crine hydrochlroide), or (3) evidence of clinically significant
declineinglobalcognitivefunctioningbasedonthe3MSscores
(≥1.5SDrace-specificdeclinefromanindividual’
sbaseline3MS
score to the 3MS score at his/her last available visit). The date
of dementia diagnosis by the latter criterion was considered
to be when an individual’
s 3MS score first fell below the cut-
off for a 1.5 SD race-specific decline in comparison with his or
her baseline 3MS score. Time to event was defined as the time
between a participant’
s year 5 visit and when the participant
was either classified as having incident dementia or censored
from observation at the last available contact.
Other Variables
Age, sex, race, and education were self-reported at baseline.
Literacy, in terms of reading grade level, was assessed shortly
after baseline using the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in
Medicine (REALM).22 Cardiovascular comorbidities, includ-
ing diabetes mellitus, hypertension, history of stroke or tran-
sient ischemic attack, and history of myocardial infarction,
were determined at baseline and follow-up visits based on a
combination of self-report data, physician diagnosis, medica-
tions, and laboratory values. Body mass index (calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) was
recordedatbaselineandfollow-upvisitsfromdirectheightand
weight measurements. Participants self-reported cigarette
smoking. APOE genotype testing was conducted via standard
single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses, and participants
were coded as ε4 carriers vs noncarriers. Treatment for de-
pression with antidepressant medication was determined
based on medication information collected at clinic visits, tak-
ing into account that antidepressant use was related to de-
pression rather than other indications.
Statistical Analysis
Weevaluatedtrajectoriesofdepressivesymptomsoverthefirst
5 years using latent class growth curve analysis, a semipara-
metric analysis that differentiates groups of individuals based
on their probability of following a similar trajectory on an out-
comeovertime.23Weconductedlatentclassgrowthcurveanaly-
sisusingastatisticalprocedure(SASProcTraj;SASInstituteInc)
to estimate the mean trajectories of CES-D-10 scores (mea-
sured at years 1, 3, 4, and 5) across visits. The repeated CES-
D-10 scores were modeled as censored normal.24 We evalu-
atedtheappropriatenumberoftrajectoriesandtrajectoryshape
following recommended procedures.24 We required that each
trajectory group had to include at least 5% of participants.24
Model selection proceeded in the following manner. For each
model specifying a given number of trajectories, we tested lin-
ear, quadratic, and cubic terms to determine what shapes best
fit the data (terms were considered significant if P < .05). Using
the resulting models, we evaluated the appropriate number of
trajectoriesbycalculatingtheestimatedlogBayesfactor,which
compares Bayesian information criterion values between
models.23 Log Bayes factor values exceeding 10 are considered
a “very strong” indicator that the more complex model better
fits the data.23 These procedures indicated that a model with 3
trajectories(2cubicand1quadratic)wassuperiortomodelswith

The time line was used to investigate the association between depressive
symptom trajectories over years 1 through 5 and subsequent risk of dementia
after year 5. Comorbidities and other health factor variables were assessed at
year 5 to adjust models for health factors that had developed by the end of the
depressive symptom assessment period. To adjust for differences in overall
level of cognitive functioning and cognitive change during the depressive
symptom assessment period, models were adjusted for the mean Modified
Mini-Mental State Examination score over years 1 through 5 and the Modified
Mini-Mental State Examination difference score (year 5 minus year 1).

fewer trajectories (log Bayes factor for 2-trajectory model vs
1-trajectory model was 2368.06, and log Bayes factor for 3-tra-
jectory model vs 2-trajectory model was 607.34). Although a
model with 4 trajectories was associated with further improve-
ment in model fit (log Bayes factor, 228.52), this model yielded
a trajectory with less than 5% of participants. Therefore, we se-
lected the 3-trajectory model for use in subsequent analyses.
We used χ2 tests and analyses of variance to explore
whether participant characteristics differed between depres-
sive trajectory groups. To examine the association between
depressivesymptomtrajectoriesandriskofdementia,weplot-
ted Kaplan-Meier survival curves and conducted Cox propor-

(age, sex, and race), education, and literacy. Model 3 addition-

fered between trajectory groups (P < .10). These variables were
assessed at year 5 to enable investigation of the effect of de-

status in predicting risk of dementia.
We conducted sensitivity analyses to investigate whether

tia risk above and beyond the effect of depressive symptoms

Results of unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards
regression models are summarized in Table 2. Compared with
individuals with consistently minimal depressive symptoms,
those with high and increasing symptoms were significantly
more likely to develop dementia even in the fully adjusted
model 4 (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.94; 95% CI, 1.30-2.90).
Whilethemoderateandincreasingsymptomtrajectorywasas-
sociated with increased risk of dementia in models 1 through
3, this association was reduced and became nonsignificant in
model4afteradjustingformeancognitivefunctioningandcog-
nitive change during the depressive symptom assessment pe-
riod (adjusted HR, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.91-1.49). There were no in-
teractions between depressive symptom trajectory and sex,
race, or APOE ε4 carrier status (P > .05 for all).
Sensitivity analyses examining whether depressive symp-
tom trajectories were associated with risk of dementia above
and beyond depressive symptoms at one time point yielded re-
sults similar to our primary findings. After adding adjustment
for year 1 CES-D-10 score to model 4, the high and increasing
depressive symptom trajectory was significantly associated
with dementia incidence (adjusted HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.04-
2.93), while the moderate and increasing symptoms trajec-
tory was not (adjusted HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.85-1.48). There was
no association between year 1 CES-D-10 score and dementia in-
cidence in this model (adjusted HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.97-1.06).
This same pattern was apparent when adding adjustment for
year 5 CES-D-10 score to model 4, with adjusted HRs of 2.08
(95%CI,1.17-3.70)forhighandincreasingsymptoms,1.20(95%
CI,0.88-1.63)formoderateandincreasingsymptoms,and0.99
(95% CI, 0.96-1.03) for year 5 CES-D-10 score.
To explore whether treatment with antidepressant medi-
cation influenced findings, we added adjustment for antide-
pressantmedicationuseduringthedepressivesymptomassess-
mentperiodtomodel4,andresultsremainedsimilar.However,
only 6.2% (n = 154) of the cohort took antidepressant medica-
tion, limiting our ability to further explore medication effects.
Discussion
We found that older adults with patterns of moderate and
increasing and high and increasing depressive symptoms
were more likely to develop dementia than those with consis-
tently minimal symptoms. After adjusting for individuals’

cognitive functioning at the time of their depressive symp-
tom trajectories, only the high and increasing trajectory re-
mained associated with increased risk of dementia. Whether
depression is a risk factor for dementia vs a symptom of an un-
derlying neurodegenerative process is a complex question. Al-
though our study cannot fully disentangle these possibilities,
our results suggest the nature of the depression-dementia re-
lationship may differ depending on the pattern of depressive
symptoms. Given that predementia cognitive functioning at
least partially explained the association we observed be-
tween the moderate and increasing depressive symptom tra-
jectory and dementia risk, it is possible that older adults with
that trajectory were experiencing depressive symptoms as an
emotional reaction to already being in the early stages of cog-
nitive decline. Alternatively, the same underlying disease pro-
cess may give rise to both cognitive decline and moderate and
increasing depressive symptoms. In contrast, our results sug-
gest that a trajectory of high and increasing depressive symp-
toms is an independent risk factor for dementia. Older adults
following that trajectory were almost twice as likely to de-
velop dementia even after adjusting for cognitive function-
ing at the time of their depressive trajectories. Moreover, de-
mentia risk associated with that trajectory was not simply due
to high baseline depressive symptoms or high symptoms at the
most recent time point. Instead, a pattern of depressive symp-
toms that are both chronically high and increasing over time
appears particularly impactful in increasing dementia risk.
There are many potential mechanisms by which depres-
sive symptoms may either lead to dementia or be a prodro-
mal phase of dementia. Both major depression and depres-
sive symptoms in older adults are associated with reductions
in hippocampal volume,25,26 and the neurotoxicity hypoth-
esis posits that glucocorticoids released in response to stress
may be responsible for this atrophy.27 Associations between
depression and β-amyloid levels28 raise the possibility that de-
pressive symptoms may be an early indication of preclinical
Alzheimer disease or that depression may more directly lead
to development of Alzheimer neuropathology.29 Cerebrovas-
culardisease30,31andinflammation32mayalsounderliethede-
pression-dementia relationship because these processes are
associated with both depressive symptoms and cognitive de-
cline. Future research is needed to clarify whether mecha-
nisms driving associations between depressive symptoms and
dementia may differ depending on the pattern of depressive
symptoms that individuals experience over time.
Our results suggest that tracking older persons’depressive
symptoms over time in clinical settings may help identify indi-

Strengths of our study include a novel analysis to identify
different depressive symptom trajectories and explore associa-
tions with dementia risk. Our study benefits from the ability to
divide follow-up time into 2 segments, which helps establish
temporal precedence of the observed relationships. Limita-
tions include that our analysis time line was somewhat arbi-
trary, and we cannot confirm causality, nor can we be certain of
whentheearlieststagesofneurodegenerationfirstbeganamong
individuals who developed dementia, particularly because de-
mentia can have a long prodromal period.35 Relatedly, because
our dementia outcome was based on an algorithm rather than a
clinical evaluation, misclassification is possible, and we cannot

the threshold of dementia. In addition, we studied a cohort of
relativelyhealthy,mostlynondepressedolderadultsratherthan
a clinical sample; therefore, results may differ for older adults
who are seen in clinical settings for depression care.
Conclusions
In summary, we identified a pattern of high and increasing de-
pressive symptoms as an independent risk factor for demen-
tia, while moderate and increasing depressive symptoms may
be associated with incident dementia in relation to an under-
lying neurodegenerative disease process already in progress.
Our results suggest that individuals’trajectory of depressive
symptoms may inform dementia risk above and beyond as-
sessment of depressive symptoms at one time point alone. Be-
cause few participants in our study were taking antidepres-
sant medication and no information about nonpharmacologic
interventions was known, we were unable to thoroughly in-
vestigate the potential effect of treatment for depression on
our findings. Future studies are needed to determine whether
depressioninterventions,particularlyforindividualswithhigh
and increasing symptoms, may help improve older adults’de-
pressivesymptomtrajectoriesandinturnreducedementiarisk.
