ABSTRACT
Serious bacterial infections in immunocompromised patients require highly effective antibacterial therapy for cure,
and thus, this setting may reveal novel mechanisms by which bacteria circumvent antibiotics in the absence of immune pressure.
Here, an infant with leukemia developed vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) bacteremia that persisted for
26 days despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Sequencing of 22 consecutive VRE isolates identified the emergence of a single
missense mutation (L152F) in relA, which constitutively activated the stringent response, resulting in elevated baseline levels of
the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). Although the mutant remained susceptible to both linezolid and daptomycin
in clinical MIC testing and during planktonic growth, it demonstrated tolerance to high doses of both antibiotics when growing
in a biofilm. This biofilm-specific gain in resistance was reflected in the broad shift in transcript levels caused by the mutation.
Only an experimental biofilm-targeting ClpP-activating antibiotic was able to kill the mutant strain in an established biofilm.
The relA mutation was associated with a fitness trade-off, forming smaller and less-well-populated biofilms on biological sur-
faces. We conclude that clinically relevant relA mutations can emerge during prolonged VRE infection, causing baseline activa-
tion of the stringent response, subsequent antibiotic tolerance, and delayed eradication in an immunocompromised state.
IMPORTANCE The increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens is a major challenge currently facing the med-
ical community. Such pathogens are of particular importance in immunocompromised patients as these individuals may favor
emergence of novel resistance determinants due to lack of innate immune defenses and intensive antibiotic exposure. During the
course of chemotherapy, a patient developed prolonged bacteremia with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium that failed
to clear despite multiple front-line antibiotics. The consecutive bloodstream isolates were sequenced, and a single missense mu-
tation identified in the relA gene, the mediator of the stringent response. Strains harboring the mutation had elevated baseline
levels of the alarmone and displayed heightened resistance to the bactericidal activity of multiple antibiotics, particularly in a
biofilm. Using a new class of compounds that modulate ClpP activity, the biofilms were successfully eradicated. These data rep-
resent the first clinical emergence of mutations in the stringent response in vancomycin-resistant entereococci.

urrent challenges in treatment of infections are focused on the
marked reduction of new candidates in the antibacterial dis-
covery pipeline at a time of increasing rates of antimicrobial resis-
tance, including emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), �-lactam- and macrolide-resistant Streptococcus
pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (1–4).
VRE species are especially problematic clinically, as these bacteria
are resistant to all first-line antibiotics and infection is associated
with a marked increase in risk of mortality (5–8). However, other
challenges to therapeutic success are also emerging, particularly in
the immuncompromised host, where refractory bacteremia and
prolonged antibiotic therapy increase the opportunity to select for
alternative bacterial survival traits by mutation or genetic ex-
change (9–12). Once mutations arise, the permissive nature of the
compromised immune system may allow for the development of
secondary mutations that compensate for any associated fitness
trade-offs (13). As such, hosts more permissive for infection have
been postulated to represent an important reservoir for the emer-
gence of novel problematic pathogens (14).
In the absence of host defenses, bacterial killing by antibiotics is
required for cure. Commonly this is ensured by administering
drugs with the aim of ensuring that concentrations at the site of
infection are above the MIC as reported by the clinical laboratory.
This assumes the bactericidal concentration is close to the MIC.
However, bacteria can persist when the MIC and minimal bacte-
ricidal concentration (MBC) dissociate such that antibiotics in-

 hibit growth but fail to kill, a property called “tolerance” (15–17).
As genome sequencing technologies improve, it has become evi-
dent that mutations—particularly those involved in stress re-
sponses—can impact efficacy of antibiotics (18). The bacterial
stringent response, which slows metabolism under low-nutrient
or stress conditions, can decrease the response to antibiotic ther-
apy, allowing quiescent bacteria to survive and tolerate antibiotics,
without a change in MIC (19). In S. aureus, induction of the strin-
gent response increases tolerance to �-lactam antibiotics (20–22),
and in Gram-negative bacteria, activation contributes to the pro-
duction of biofilm persister cells (23, 24). Also, a report on Entero-
coccus faecalis demonstrated that treatment of cells with mupiro-
cin induced expression of transport and stress-related genes, and
strong repression of genes involved DNA, RNA, and protein syn-
thesis, similar to a stringent response (25). Despite the importance
of the stringent response, there are few reports of clinical emer-
gence of mutations in this pathway, none demonstrating reduced
antibiotic efficacy (22), and no studies focusing on antibiotic tol-
erance and stringent response in E. faecium. For Enterococcus spe-
cies, although the stringent response pathway is well characterized
and antibiotic resistance is widespread, we report the first example
of mutation in the stringent response pathway causing increased
baseline alarmone levels, which was responsible for antibiotic tol-
erance within a biofilm.
RESULTS
Clinical setting. The patient was a 6-week-old African-American
girl born by normal vaginal delivery at term. Acute myeloid leu-
kemia was diagnosed at 4 weeks of age, after she presented with
fever and marked leukocytosis. A double-lumen central venous
catheter (CVC) was placed (7.0 French-scale Hickman catheter;
Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT), and chemotherapy was
initiated, resulting in prolonged profound neutropenia. Induc-
tion chemotherapy comprised systemic cytarabine, daunorubicin,
etoposide, and methylprednisolone plus intrathecal methotrex-
ate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine. The patient received intrave-
nous cefepime as antibacterial prophylaxis. After 2 weeks of che-
motherapy, during profound neutropenia, routine microscopic
examination of a peripheral blood smear revealed bacterial organ-
isms, although the patient had no signs or symptoms of infection.
Blood cultures were obtained from both lumens of the CVC, and
empirical combination therapy with vancomycin and mero-
penem was initiated. After blood cultures grew vancomycin-
resistant Enterococcus faecium, the antibiotic regimen was changed
to linezolid, which was eventually supplemented with daptomy-
cin, gentamicin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin (Table 1).
Initial paired blood cultures drawn from the two CVC lumens
showed a differential time to positivity of 4.0 h, and culture of the
explanted device at the time of CVC removal (day 9) was positive
for E. faecium, suggesting that the infection was initially related to
biofilm on the surface of the CVC (26). However, over the 28 days,
the bacteremia failed to clear despite targeted antibiotic therapy,
as well as CVC removal and replacement on two occasions, both
allowing for CVC-free periods. Antibiotic therapy was chosen in
accordance with expert opinion and in vitro susceptibility testing
that indicated the strain remained sensitive to all antibiotics ad-
ministered except the initial vancomycin and meropenem (27).
During the persistent bacteremia, there was no significant
change in the reported antimicrobial susceptibility pattern ac-
cording to testing performed in our clinical microbiology lab-
oratory. Every strain was susceptible to linezolid (MIC, 1 to
2 �g/ml), quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC, 0.5 �g/ml), and dap-
tomycin (MIC, 3 to 4 �g/ml). High-level resistance to gentamicin
was not detected (MIC, �500 �g/ml).
A comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, including Doppler ul-
trasonography of the upper and lower extremities to detect intra-
vascular thrombosis, ultrasound of head and abdomen, and mag-
netic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire body failed, to
identify any additional source of persistent infection. Analysis of
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained through lumbar puncture on
day 2 of infection was within normal limits, and bacterial culture
was sterile. Transthoracic echocardiography performed on days
11 and 22 showed mild preexisting aortic regurgitation without
clear evidence of vegetations. The initial source for the blood-
stream infection is thought to have been luminal colonization and
biofilm formation within the CVC, and after device removal, the
bloodstream infection persisted. Based on this history, we believe
that the most likely focus of persistent infection was occult endo-
carditis or septic thrombophlebitis.
The patient’s absolute neutrophil count (ANC) remained at
0 cells/mm3 until day 20, when donor granulocyte transfusion was
initiated. Granulocyte transfusion was repeated again on days 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, and 27 until neutropenia resolved. Daily ANC val-
ues are shown in Table 1. On day 27, the bacteremia cleared, and
the patient received an additional 6 weeks of linezolid treatment
for possible endocarditis with full clinical recovery.
Genetic characterization. The initial VRE isolate was se-
quenced and completely assembled to obtain a closed genome
comprising one 2.93-Mbp chromosome and three plasmids of
171, 78.6, and 59.2 kbp, containing a total of approximately 3,208
open reading frames (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
Analysis of the functional roles of predicted coding regions re-
vealed multiple antibiotic resistance systems, including the vanB
gene cluster for vancomycin, fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides,
�-lactams, and multiple putative drug efflux pumps (Table 2) (28,
29). All 22 isolates were completely sequenced at high depth
(mean coverage of 256.6�) and aligned to the closed reference
genome of the initial VRE isolate. In total, all genomes differed by
only five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and no inser-
tions or deletions were detected, indicating that a single strain was
responsible for the prolonged bacteremia. Four of the five muta-
tions were identified only once in single isolates: therefore, we
concluded these mutations were not clinically relevant. These mu-
tations included Y175C missense mutation in rnz (RNase Z), the
A221D missense mutation in ptsI (phosphoenolpyruvate phos-
photransferase enzyme I), the P640H missense mutation in recF
(recombination protein F), and a silent mutation in a hypothetical
plasmid protein (Table 1). However, one missense mutation in
the relA gene, predicted to encode an RelA(L152F) variant, was
found in eight isolates. The relA mutation was first detected 3 days
after starting antibiotic therapy and persisted through the clinical
course until the infection eventually resolved (Table 1). The ob-
servation that the mutation was intermittently identified indi-
cated that both the initial strain and the relA mutant strain coex-
isted until the later stages of the infection. As will be discussed,
there may have been initial sampling bias during collection of a
representative isolate from each day listed in Table 1; however, we
believe this may have underestimated the true presence and per-
sistence of the relA variant subpopulation.

 via production of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate
(ppGpp) and has been implicated in resistance or tolerance to
antibiotic stress in several bacterial pathogens (30). In our RelA
mutants, the altered residue (L152F) is immediately adjacent to
residues essential for the hydrolase activity of the RelA enzyme
(31). Modeling of the structural consequences of this mutation
indicated that the native leucine is buried in the structure; how-
ever, replacement of this residue with a phenylalanine would not
allow for such tight packing, potentially causing a local change in
the active site. This mutation was initially detected on the fourth
day of the bloodstream infection and appeared to become more
prevalent later in the course of therapy, particularly once dapto-
mycin was included in the antibiotic regimen (Table 1). Previous
studies have also identified mutations in relA in response to dap-
tomycin exposure in vitro, although no impact on antibiotic effi-
cacy has been demonstrated (32). These data indicate that the VRE
population remained mostly homogeneous, except for a single-
point mutation in the stringent response pathway. This relA mu-
tation arose during the course of the infection and persisted
throughout the course of therapy despite treatment with antibiot-

 ics to which the bacterium retained apparent susceptibility based
on MIC testing. It is worth noting that the VRE strains analyzed in
this paper were genetically identical (isogenic), except for the relA
missense mutation, and they all possessed multiple antibiotic re-
sistance genes as shown in Table 2. Furthermore, no growth de-
fects were identified between the wild type (WT) and the isogenic
relA mutants in the absence of stressors (see Fig. S1A in the sup-
plemental material).
Effects of RelA mutation. The missense mutation in a highly
conserved domain essential for RelA hydrolase activity led us to
ascertain whether the identified mutation in relA conferred any
discernible differences in levels of (p)ppGpp, the alarmone that
mediates the downstream stringent response pathways. Strains
that were genetically identical with the exception of the single-
base-pair relA mutation were allowed to incorporate 32P, and the
baseline levels of (p)ppGpp were measured. Strains carrying the
mutation in relA demonstrated approximately 3� greater basal
levels of ppGpp than the WT controls (Fig. 1A, thin-layer chro-
matography [TLC] blot, and B, quantification [P � 0.001, Mann-
Whitney test]). This observation suggested inappropriate activa-
tion of the alarmone at baseline in the absence of an external
stimulus, potentially priming the cells to more rapidly adapt to
adverse conditions such as antibiotic exposure. While we at-
tempted to monitor differences in (p)ppGpp and GTP levels in
linezolid-stressed relA WT and mutant strains, we could not de-
tect any induction of the stringent response (Fig. 1C). It should be
noted that both WT and relA mutant bacteria stressed with mupi-
rocin did not show a difference in activated stringent response
alarmone levels (WT shown in Fig. 1C [mutant identical to WT]).
However, as will be discussed, we suggest the fitness benefit of the
relA mutation is to provide a higher resting level of alarmone,
which allowed these strains to better adapt and respond to antibi-
otic stress during therapy (tolerance).

 is associated with the development of surface-associated bacterial
biofilm (33–35). This was possibly followed by biofilm formation
on the heart valves; however, this could not be conclusively diag-
nosed. As mutations in relA have been implicated in alterations in
biofilm formation, we next determined the effect of this mutation
on the capacity of these strains to form biofilm. Since traditional
growth curves (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material) and
time-kill assays (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material) did not
detect differences in the survival of the relA mutant compared to
an isogenic relA WT strain (planktonic growth) in the presence of
daptomycin or linezolid, we hypothesized that the mutation may
demonstrate a more pronounced phenotype in a biofilm popula-
tion. To explore a possible fitness trade-off in biofilm formation,
we grew biofilms on fibronectin-coated 24-well plates for 24 h.
After removal of any planktonic cells and staining with crystal
violet, absorbance at 595 nm was determined as a quantification of
biofilm size and thickness. Parallel to this analysis, we resuspended
non-crystal violet-treated biofilms in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) and serially diluted and plated for CFU-per-milliliter
counts. As shown in Fig. 2A, the relA mutant consistently had
significantly smaller biofilms than the isogenic WT strain when
grown on these fibronectin-coated surfaces. Concurrently, iden-
tically grown biofilms identified at least a log decrease of relA
mutant biofilm growth compared to the WT isogenic strain (109
versus 108 CFU after 24 h of growth in fibronectin-coated plates).
Each strain was grown under identical conditions, as well as inoc-
ulated from titrated stocks, indicating that the missense mutation
in relA conferred a defect in biofilm formation and bacterial sur-
vival within a biofilm.
To further investigate defects in biofilm formation of our relA
mutant, we performed confocal fluorescence microscopy. Here,
biofilms of relA WT and mutant isogenic strains were allowed to

 form on an abiotic surface (microscope slide chamber) for 48 h.
Live/dead staining was then performed, and confocal microscopy
was used to measure fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and te-
tramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC) fluorescence of
z-stack 16-�m sections of each biofilm. To remove bias from bio-
film sampling, each chamber for each strain was randomly ana-
lyzed in four separate sections, and each strain was analyzed in two
separate chambers on multiple days, allowing an n value of 8 for
each strain. Figure 2B shows that the WT strain had consistently
brighter fluorescence in each section, compared to the relA mu-
tant on the right. Furthermore, when the green and red signals
were quantified and a ratio determined (Fig. 2C), there was a
consistently higher fluorescent intensity for live cells for the WT
strains. This suggests that the biofilm of the mutant harbors less
total live cells, which correlates back to the CFU/ml data of estab-
lished cells. Together, our biofilm analysis suggests that the ability
to form thicker, more robust biofilms is compromised in the relA
mutant.
A mutation such as relA(L152F) that primes cells to enter the
stringent response by increasing ppGpp levels is expected to affect
expression of many genes. Likewise, the phenotypic differences
between planktonic and biofilm growth of these strains should be
related to transcriptome changes. We tested these predictions by
performing RNA sequencing on these strains grown either in the
liquid planktonic phase or as biofilms on a biotic surface. This
experiment revealed broad changes in expression in as much as
15% of the ~2,940 genes in the genome in the relA mutant com-
pared to the WT and during the shift from planktonic to biofilm
growth. The interactions between genotype and growth environ-
ment were most telling. Not only did this single relA mutation
affect expression (mostly by downregulation) of a broad array of
genes in both conditions, it also changed how certain genes re-
sponded during the shift from planktonic to biofilm growth. In
fact, 35 genes responded in opposite directions in the shift to bio-
film growth for the WT and the mutant (i.e., expression was up for
the WT, down for the mutant, or vice versa), and 25 genes were
divergently expressed for the relA mutant under biofilm and
planktonic growth conditions. Some of these genes with divergent
expression provide potential mechanistic explanations for the
biofilm-dependent resistance observed, including liaS, a major
target of mutations causing resistance to daptomycin (36), which
was upregulated in the WT biofilm relative to WT planktonic
culture, but downregulated in the relA biofilm relative to plank-
tonic relA cells. A small group of genes were uniquely upregulated
in the relA biofilm, including genes with chaperone functions,
such as greA (EFAU004_01358) and cspA (EFAU004_01491),
which would presumably enhance stress tolerance. However, the
overwhelming signature of the relA mutant was that it downregu-
lated far more genes during biofilm growth than the WT strain
(480 genes in comparison with 214 genes), and the direct compar-
ison of the WT biofilm and the relA biofilm also revealed 433 genes
downregulated by the mutant. In summary, this single mutation
not only suppressed expression of many genes, it did so in a
biofilm-dependent manner that actually reversed the tendency of
some genes to be upregulated under this condition by the WT.
Given these biofilm-dependent changes in expression, it was
somewhat surprising to observe a fitness trade-off for the relA
mutant in forming biofilms in standard media. However, in the
patient, the bacteria would have been constantly exposed to vari-
ous antibiotic stresses during therapy. We therefore investigated
whether the relA mutation conferred enhanced tolerance to
antibiotic-mediated killing in a biofilm model. Since no resistance
was detected against linezolid and daptomycin (MIC clinical data
and Table 2), we hypothesized that the relA mutation was not
responsible for a detectable rise in antibiotic resistance, but rather
allowed the mutants to respond faster to antibiotic stress in a
biofilm, thus becoming tolerant to multiple antibiotics. Biofilms
of the two isogenic strains (WT or relA mutant) were allowed to
form on Nunc peg plates in the rich medium Todd-Hewitt broth
supplemented with yeast extract, following previously published
protocols (37, 38). As a control, the relA mutation conferred no
discernible difference in the outgrowth of planktonic cells re-
moved from biofilms in the absence of antibiotics (Fig. 3A), indi-
cating the relA mutation did not affect outgrowth from a biofilm.
However, when the biofilms were subjected to prolonged antibi-
otic exposure, high concentrations of vancomycin, linezolid, and
daptomycin were successful in eradicating the WT strain but
failed to eradicate strains harboring the relA mutation (Fig. 3B, C,
and D). It should be noted that the subsequent outgrowth of each
strain was in the absence of antibiotic, so no antibiotic carryover
could be responsible for the difference in response to antibiotic
stress. These data indicated that this mutation conferred a selec-
tive advantage to the in vitro survival of antibiotic-tolerant per-
sister cells within a biofilm, in the absence of linezolid or dapto-
mycin resistance using standard CLSI susceptibility testing.
Despite the defect of biofilm formation on fibronectin-coated
plates, the relA mutant still displayed enhanced tolerance to anti-
biotics in the biofilm state. Taken together, these data suggest that
while the relA mutation led to increased alarmone resting levels
and subsequent tolerance to multiple-antibiotic stressors, the mu-
tant strain was deficient in the ability to form biofilms compared
to its WT counterparts.
Eradication of bacterial biofilms is a major challenge during
therapy due to their inherently greater tolerance to many antibi-
otics and their capacity to both resist antibiotic penetration and
resist immune clearance (39). This phenomenon is especially con-
founded in immunocompromised patients. A new experimental
approach to target such refractory bacterial communities has been
the development of a class of compounds that cause unregulated
activation of the housekeeping protease ClpP (40). We assayed
the bactericidal activity of one such investigational compound,
ADEP-4, against isogenic strains possessing either WT or relA mu-
tant strains in the context of a biofilm. While the absence of anti-
biotic once again had no effect on the planktonic outgrowth of
bacteria, treatment with ADEP-4 successfully eradicated biofilms
of both strains (Fig. 4A and B). These data indicate that strains
harboring the relA mutation that conferred enhanced tolerance to
clinically approved antibiotics during biofilm growth remained
susceptible to this investigational class of compounds.
DISCUSSION
The stringent response is a highly conserved mechanism by which
bacteria can control broad metabolic changes required for sur-
vival under adverse conditions and has been implicated in the
virulence of several prominent pathogens (41). It has also been
implicated in the ability to promote antibiotic “tolerance”: bacte-
rial cells that are able to survive antibiotic concentrations much
higher than the MIC and can replicate once antibiotic pressure is
removed (15, 17, 19, 22, 24). It is hypothesized that this is due to
the absence or inactivity of antibiotic targets: for example, tolerant

 persister cells may not be actively dividing, so the presence of
linezolid would not affect protein synthesis and therefore would
not cause bacterial cell death. As such, these tolerant cells can
persist during prolonged antibiotic exposure, further complicat-
ing antibiotic treatment.
In Enterococcus, two enzymes are responsible for the produc-
tion of the stringent response alarmone (p)ppGpp: the bifunc-
tional RSH (i.e., Rel SpoT homolog [RelA for this study]) and the
monofunctional RelQ alarmone synthase (42, 43). Recent studies
have highlighted the importance of subtle alterations in the levels
of basal ppGpp as opposed to the higher levels induced during the
stringent response in mediating broad-range antibiotic tolerance
(42). These data suggest that mutations in relA that alter basal
ppGpp levels may confer antibiotic tolerance of significance in an
immunocompromised setting.
Emergence of a mutation in the relA gene has been observed
during persistent infection with S. aureus, but not in Enterococcus
(22). Furthermore, the identification of a clinical VRE isolate with
tolerance to multiple antibiotics due to a relA mutation has not
been previously reported. It is important to note that our
antibiotic-tolerant relA VRE mutants could not be distinguished
from their isogenic WT counterparts by standard in vitro clinical
MIC testing or by traditional growth curves (Fig. S1A) and time-
kill assays (Fig. S2) of exponentially replicating cells in liquid cul-
ture. While the fitness advantage of the relA mutation was not
present in planktonic culture, we determined that it was signifi-
cant in the biofilm elimination model, whereby the mutant sur-
vived exposure to several antibiotics used to treat infection, sug-
gesting an increase in antibiotic tolerance (Fig. 5). This has
previously been reported for multiple bacterial pathogens, but not
for VRE (22, 44). Biofilms harboring the RelA missense mutation
in the hydrolase domain had increased resting alarmone levels and
were recalcitrant to elimination by conventional antibiotic treat-
ment. This included both linezolid and daptomycin, of which no
genetically encoded antibiotic resistance mechanisms existed (Ta-
ble 2). However, both the WT and relA mutant were effectively
eradicated by ADEP-4, which has been shown to constitutively
activate the housekeeping protease ClpP. These data indicate that
such unconventional antibiotic strategies may be extremely effec-
tive for eliminating tolerant, persistent infections in an immuno-
compromised host. The ClpP-sensitive, conventional antibiotic-
tolerant biofilm population is reminiscent of the presumed
clinical course, as the focus of infection is thought to have initially
been the CVC followed by possible endocarditis, both infections
typically thought to be caused by multicellular biofilm communi-
ties. Despite antibiotic therapy, bacterial clearance required host
immune reconstitution; the infection only cleared upon neutro-
phil recovery. This is an important reminder that clinical response
may not correlate with in vitro susceptibility testing, especially in
immunocompromised hosts or biofilm-associated infections
(34).
There exist a multitude of pathways by which bacteria can
evolve greater antibiotic tolerance, as evidenced by in vitro selec-
tion; however, only a subset of the mutations observed in the
FIG 3 The relA mutation contributes to tolerance to antibiotics in biofilms. Strains were grown and allowed to form biofilms by using a peg suspension system.
Biofilms were then treated with the respective antibiotics (256 �g/ml vancomycin, 50 �g/ml linezolid, and 50 �g/ml daptomycin) for 24 h. After antibiotic
treatment, biofilms were washed, collected by centrifugation, and allowed to outgrow in antibiotic-free medium to ascertain an approximation of bacterial
killing. Data represent the mean of three replicates; error bars represent standard deviation. For clarity, 6 h to 14 h is shown, as there was no growth prior to 6 h
for drug-treated VRE.

 laboratory are identified in clinical isolates (45). Mutations con-
ferring tolerance provide an obvious advantage to bacteria in the
presence of the antibiotic but may involve trade-offs in fitness
(46). In order for new tolerance mechanisms to disseminate
throughout a population, any fitness trade-off must be alleviated
through compensatory mutations to allow the strain to compete
with and outgrow nonresistant organisms in the absence of anti-
biotic selection. In immunocompromised hosts, bacterial patho-
gens may replicate and evolve novel antibiotic tolerance mecha-
nisms free from the usual immune surveillance (47–49). This
phenomenon is reflected in our study, whereby a mutation in the
stringent response arose and was maintained under antibiotic
pressure in the context of an ongoing, profoundly immunocom-
promised state (Fig. 6).
While in vitro data suggested that the presence of the relA mu-
tation rendered these strains more tolerant to antibiotic stress
within a biofilm, we detected a fitness defect in the ability to form
biofilms of the same size compared to the isogenic WT strain. In
accordance with patient treatment (Table 1), while the immune
system was suppressed, the relA mutants were more adapted to
tolerate antibiotic stress during the multiantibiotic treatment
phase, which we hypothesized was due to higher resting alarmone
levels. Although they were able to persist within the bloodstream
of the immunocompromised patient, these relA mutants were de-
ficient in producing a larger biofilm, as shown in confocal micros-
copy results. It is well known that RelA activation and alarmone
production are responsible for the downregulation of nonessen-
tial genes and proteins, including proteins and saccharides that
form biofilm matrices (50).
As discussed, bacteremia finally resolved only upon neutrophil
recovery. These findings indicate a “perfect storm” for antibiotic
tolerance development: the compromised host immune system
ameliorates the impact of any bacterial fitness loss and provides a
permissive environment for replication coupled with continuous
antibiotic selection pressure due to the empirical therapy required
for treatment or prophylaxis. This specific set of requirements
could be relevant in several other immunocompromised patient
populations in which rates of bacterial colonization and infection
are high, especially if they are biofilm mediated.
This study has some limitations. Although persistence of bac-
teremia clinically suggested an intravascular focus such as endo-
carditis, this was never proven. Similarly, the coexistence of both
the mutant and parent strains throughout the course of infection
might represent a mixed biofilm at one site or infection with dif-
ferent isolates at discrete anatomic locations. Population profiling
might have improved the interpretation of these results, but only a
single sample was saved by the clinical microbiology laboratory at
each time point, making such profiling impossible to perform.
Generation of a relA missense mutation in the WT VRE back-
ground could provide further weight to the conclusions of the
study, but genetic manipulation of a multidrug-resistant entero-
coccal strain has the potential to introduce additional mutations
arising during prolonged passaging. Hence we opted to compare
strains that were isogenic, with the exception of the relA SNP,
based on genome sequencing for all phenotypic comparisons.
FIG 4 The ClpP activator successfully eradicates biofilm irrespective of the
relA mutation. The wild type (A) and an isogenic mutant (B) harboring the
relA missense mutation were allowed to form biofilms for 24 h. Following
biofilm formation, cells were treated with either DMSO (black lines) or the
ClpP activator ADEP-4 at 0.2 �M for 24 h (blue lines). After antibiotic treat-
ment, biofilms were washed, collected by centrifugation, and allowed to out-
grow in antibiotic-free medium to ascertain an approximation of bacterial
killing. Data represent the mean from four replicates; error bars represent
standard deviation.
FIG 5 Summary of significant differences in expression between the WT and
the relA mutant, in both planktonic and biofilm growth, as revealed by RNA-
seq. The numbers shown are the number of genes in which expression differs at
a very stringent cutoff of q � 0.001; arrow direction should be read as “is less
than.” Arrow thickness is proportionate to the number of differences. Boxes
containing both arrows denote genes with divergent expression, as follows: 35
genes have reduced expression in the relA mutant biofilm that were increased
in the WT biofilm, and 25 genes have reduced expression in the relA biofilm
that were increased in the relA planktonic culture.

 Based on our results, we conclude that during prolonged
infection, bacterial populations may acquire evolutionarily ad-
vantageous mutations conferring antibiotic tolerance. This
may be especially likely within the permissive environment of
an immunocompromised host. This is the first clinical case
showing in vivo development of a mutation in the enterococcal
relA gene during prolonged infection that functionally con-
ferred tolerance to clinically relevant antibiotics without a
change in clinically tested MIC. The case expands our under-
standing of the role of the stringent response in susceptibility
and tolerance to a wide range of antibiotics, especially in bio-
films, and demonstrates that these mutations can occur during
human infection. This mutation is especially clinically signifi-
cant, as linezolid and daptomycin are the last line of defense
against infection with VRE, an important and already highly
resistant pathogen. Furthermore, ClpP activators retained bac-
tericidal activity against the relA mutant within a biofilm, in-
dicating a potential future therapeutic strategy for targeting
such persistent infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Initial growth and storage of VRE isolates. Twenty-two VRE blood-
stream isolates, one from each day of collection, were received from the
clinical microbiology laboratory at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
A loop of each strain was grown in Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with
3% yeast extract (ThyB [Bacto BD]) at 37°C in 5% CO2. Glycerol stocks
were generated for each strain and stored at �80°C until further analysis.
Each glycerol stock was also grown on tryptic soy agar (21) containing 3%
sheep blood (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) to verify purity: colony mor-
phology results indicated that all samples were pure.
Genomic DNA extraction and sequencing. Bacteria were grown in
unshaken overnight cultures in ThyB medium and collected by centrifu-
gation before genomic DNA was extracted by using the Purelink Genomic
Extraction kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). Sequencing libraries were pre-
pared and bar-coded by using the Nextera kit (Illumina) and pooled in
one lane of an Illumina HiSeq2500, yielding a mean (standard deviation
[SD]) of 6.6 � 106 (4.2 � 106) reads and 1.0 Gbp � 637 Mbp. To obtain
a more robust genome assembly, the initial bloodstream isolate was also
subjected to PacBio sequencing with 5- to 10-kb fragment libraries loaded
on one SMRTcell (Johns Hopkins Sequencing Center), producing
385.2 Mbp of sequence. Contiguous consensus sequences (contigs) were
assembled by using the PacBio SMRTanalysis toolkit, resulting in a ge-
nome containing 3,242,672 Mbp in four circular contigs and 118.8�
mean per-bp coverage. This polished genome served as a reference for the
mapping of all subsequent Illumina short reads, at a mean per-base-pair
coverage of 256.6� (SD, 138�). Reference mapping and the detection of
SNPs, indels, and structural variants were conducted by using breseq soft-
ware as described previously (51). Mutation calls were pooled by using a
custom shell script, 23 of which were used to correct the PacBio genome
assembly at sites that were mostly restricted to one plasmid. A preliminary
set of nine putative unique calls were verified by manually inspecting the
sequence pileups, which revealed 4 false mutations produced by poor
alignments and 5 consensus mutations among the 22 bloodstream iso-
lates, including one in the relA gene responsible for the stringent response.
relA sequencing. A single VRE isolate from each of infection days 1, 3,
and 5 (wild type) and 4, 16, and 17 (mutant) was grown in 5 ml ThyB
overnight at 37°C. Cultures were bead beaten with silica beads for 10 min
to break open cells. An internal fragment of the relA gene of each isolate
was PCR amplified by using forward primer 5=-GTGGACGGCGTAACC
AAATTAGGG-3= and reverse primer 5=-CCACTTACGTATTTTTCACG
TTCTTCTC-3=. DreamTaq Green DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific)
FIG 6 Pathway of stringent response with relA hydrolase mutation. During stress response, RelA (RSH/SpoT homolog in VRE) and RelQ are responsible for the
production of the alarmone (red circles). In the relA mutants, a missense mutation adjacent to an active site in the hydrolysis domain led to increased resting levels
of ppGpp. Cells were “primed” to respond faster to stress in a biofilm, which included antibiotic stress in the patient’s case. We propose that the presence of
ppGpp downregulated multiple nonessential pathways, as shown by the RNA-seq data, including biofilm components. Therefore, while the relA mutant was fit
to survive in an immunocompromised patient, once the immune system was reconstituted, the fitness trade-off of a smaller, less robust biofilm would enhance
susceptibility to neutrophil killing.

 was used with a 51°C annealing temperature and a 1-min extension period
at 72°C for 30 cycles. PCRs were cleaned up by using Qiagen MinElute kits
and sequenced by using the forward primer with Sanger sequencing to
confirm the relA SNP.
Planktonic growth measurements. Ninety-six-well plates (Costar)
were inoculated with approximately 2 � 106 CFU/ml of either the relA
WT or isogenic relA mutant per well. Two hundred microliters ThyB was
used to measure the growth of each strain in the presence of linezolid
(6.25 �g/ml) over 8 h. After 8 h, triplicates of each strain in either no drug
or linezolid were serially diluted on ThyB agar and plates were incubated
at 37°C overnight. The number of CFU per milliliter was calculated, and
growth of each strain was compared to growth at 8 h in no drug. Two-
tailed t test was used to calculate significant differences in the growth of
each strain, of which there were no significant differences observed.
Time-kill kinetics. VRE isolates corresponding to the WT (day 5) and
relA mutant (day 17) were grown overnight in ThyB (pH 6.5) at 37°C.
Cultures were back-diluted 1:100 or 1:1,000 to produce an approximate
starting culture of 105 CFU/ml. To obtain the daptomycin kill kinetics,
sterile-filtered (0.22-�m-pore filter) 1 mM CaCl2 was added to ThyB
prior to the experiment. Aliquots (1 ml) of each culture were separately
analyzed over time (in triplicate), and either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/
PBS (no-compound control [Sigma/Lonza]), 50 �g/ml daptomycin
(Cubist Pharmaceuticals), or 200 �g/ml linezolid (Sigma) was added.
Each sample was analyzed by performing serial dilution to determine the
number of CFU per milliliter over time. The limit of detection was 1 �
103 CFU/ml. Each time-kill assay was repeated three times, and a repre-
sentative replicate is presented (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material).
Biofilm antibiotic tolerance assays. Nunc plates with peg lids were
used to grow VRE biofilms and analyze the biofilm eradication capabilities
of linezolid, vancomycin, and daptomycin. A 200-�l aliquot of ThyB
(�1 mM CaCl2 for daptomycin) was inoculated into single wells of the
96-well plates. Each condition was tested at least in triplicate for WT and
the isogenic relA mutant. Frozen stocks of VRE from days 5 (22) and 17
(relA mutant) were inoculated into each well. Peg lids were seeded into the
liquid culture, and the cells were allowed to grow overnight at 37°C. Peg
lids were then washed in sterile water to remove planktonic cells, placed in
new Nunc plates containing ThyB and under the appropriate drug/stress
condition, and incubated at 37°C overnight. A second wash in sterile
water was then performed, and the peg lid was placed into a new Nunc
plate with 100 �l ThyB. Centrifugation at 800 � g for 20 min was per-
formed to remove biofilms from the peg. After centrifugation, peg lids
were discarded, and the plate was incubated at 37°C overnight in a Cyta-
tion 3 (BioTek) plate reader recording absorbance at 600 nm over 24 h.
This method allowed quantification of the growth of any viable cells from
the biofilms. The average of at least three independent readings is reported
for each strain and condition.
Stringent response measurement. Strains were grown at 37°C in
C�Y medium (53) without potassium phosphate until an optical density
at 600 nm (OD600) measurement of 0.2 was obtained. To a 1-ml aliquot of
culture, 500 �Ci of [32P]orthophosphate (American Radiolabeled Chem-
icals) was added. After a 2.5-h incubation, a 100-�l aliquot of culture was
added to 50 �l of 13 M formic acid and then exposed to two freeze/thaw
cycles using dry ice. Samples were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine
(PEI)-cellulose TLC plate (Analtech) and developed in a tank of 1.5 M
KH2PO4 (pH 3.4). After the plate was dried, it was exposed to a phospho-
imaging screen for 48 h; the signal intensity was read by using a Typhoon
FLA 9500 (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) and quantified by using Im-
ageQuant TL. Five replicates harboring a WT relA locus and five replicates
harboring the point mutation of interest were included in these experi-
ments. As a control, each VRE strain was incubated with 100 �g/ml mupi-
rocin (Sigma) as a positive control for stringent response induction. In
addition, strains were also incubated with 10 �g/ml linezolid to determine
whether linezolid exposure induced the stringent response.
Biofilm quantification assays. Twenty-four-well plates (Costar) were
coated with bovine plasma fibronectin (Sigma) by an overnight incuba-
tion at 37°C. Each well was gently washed with 1 ml of 1� PBS, followed
by addition of 1 ml fresh ThyB and inoculated from frozen titered stocks
of the VRE WT or relA mutant. Biofilms were allowed to form by over-
night growth without shaking at 37°C. Supernatant was removed, and
each biofilm was gently washed twice with 1� PBS to remove planktonic
bacteria. PBS was discarded, and wells were allowed to dry. Four hundred
microliters of 1% (wt/vol) crystal violet was added to each well or 1 �l PBS
to disrupt biofilms for determination of CFU per milliliter. After 20 min
for staining, crystal violet was removed, and each well was washed multi-
ple times with 1 � PBS until supernatant was clear. After drying, 1 ml 95%
ethanol was added to each well, and the well was gently shaken for 10 min
to allow complete solubilization of the crystal violet into solution. Absor-
bance at 595 nm was measured using a Cytation3 plate reader (BioTek) to
quantify biofilm. At least three independent determinations for each ex-
perimental condition were performed. The number of CFU per milliliter
for each biofilm was determined via serial dilution and plating on ThyB
agar.
Fluorescence microscopy of VRE biofilms. �-slide 8-chamber mi-
croscopy slides (IBIDI) were inoculated (each chamber) with 300 �l ThyB
per well plus 3-�l frozen stocks of the VRE relA WT or mutant. Slides were
incubated overnight at 37°C to allow biofilms to form. Two hundred
microliters of medium was carefully removed from each chamber in order
to not disrupt formed biofilms, 200 �l fresh ThyB was added, and slides
were again incubated overnight at 37°C. One hour prior to confocal mi-
croscopy, components A and B of the Thermo Scientific Live/Dead
BacLight bacterial viability kit were thawed and equally mixed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. One microliter of this mixture was
then carefully added to wells at a staggered interval of 30 min, to allow
comparable microscopy pictures of live/dead staining to occur. After a
30-min incubation at room temperature in the dark, the first chamber was
analyzed in a confocal microscope (Nikon C2). For each chamber, four
random segments were subject to z-stacking at a total height of 16 �m
from the first fluorescent image corresponding to the bottom of the bio-
film. Total green (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC]) and red (tetram-
ethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate [TRITC]) filter sets from this volume
(16 �m3) were analyzed for each segment, and each strain was analyzed in
at least 2 separate chambers. This allowed an n value of 8, corresponding
to four individual segments per chamber. The ratio of green to red signal
was calculated from the average of each section, and results were com-
bined for the final average value reported. Prism6 was used to analyze all
data, and significance was calculated via two-tailed t test.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qRT-PCR, rRNA depletion,
and RNA sequencing. Seventy-five-square-centimeter flasks (Corning)
were coated overnight at 37°C with fibronectin (Sigma). After 24 h, each
flask was inoculated with 30 ml ThyB and either the relA WT or mutant.
After 24 h, supernatant was removed, and biofilm cells were scraped off
the flask, eluted in 10 ml RNAprotect, and pelleted by a 10-min spin at
10,000 � g. Planktonic cells were grown in 30 ml ThyB until mid-log
phase (OD600 of 0.5), suspended in RNAprotect, and pelleted by a 10-min
spin at 10,000 � g. Each biofilm sample was comprised of 3 flasks that
were subsequently extracted and pooled to generate sufficient RNA for
sequencing. All samples were run in triplicate for planktonic or biofilm
pellets for each strain, and RNA extraction was performed immediately
after collection of the cell pellets.
RNA extraction was performed using the Qiagen RNeasy kit with
slight modifications for initial cell lysis. Briefly, 250 �l silicon beads was
added to each pellet containing RLT lysis buffer and 2-mercaptoethanol
and bead beat (FastPrep MP Biomedicals) for one cycle of 45 s with a
setting of 5.5. After cell lysis, the Qiagen RNeasy process was continued
with a QiaShredder cleanup step and the RNeasy protocol was completed.
Each RNA sample was eluted in a final volume of 30 �l of RNase-free
water and stored at �20°C. rRNA was depleted using the RiboMinus kit
(Thermo-Fisher) following the manufacturer’s guidelines. For each sam-
ple, 30 �g of RNA was utilized for the depletions. Following depletion,

RNA-seq analysis. Four replicates each of the relA WT and mutant
strains were grown under planktonic and biofilm conditions, and RNA
was extracted from bulk cultures. RNA libraries were prepared for se-
quencing and pooled on one lane of an Illumina HiSeq2000 at St. Jude
Children’s Research Hospital. These produced an average of 82 million
reads for the WT planktonic cultures, 91 million reads for the WT biofilm
cultures, 82 million reads for the relA planktonic cultures, and 130 million
reads for the relA biofilm cultures. Differences in expression were evalu-
ated using Rockhopper version 2.03 (52), which compares strand-aware,
normalized sequence counts found throughout the reference genome.
We used the well-annotated E. faecalis Aus04 reference genome
(PRJNA86649) for this purpose, which had high identity to the strains
reported here. Resulting P values of differentially expressed genes were
used to compute false discovery rate (q) values derived from a Benjamini-
Hochberg correction with a false discovery rate of �1%. Only q values of
�0.001 are reported here in Table S2 in the supplemental material, almost
certainly underestimating the number of significant differences.
