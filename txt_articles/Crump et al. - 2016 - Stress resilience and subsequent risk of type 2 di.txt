Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Psychosocial stress in adulthood is associat-
ed with a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, possibly mediated by
behavioural and physiological factors. However, it is un-
known whether low stress resilience earlier in life is related
to subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. We examined
whether low stress resilience in late adolescence is associated
with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood.
Methods We conducted a national cohort study of all
1,534,425 military conscripts in Sweden during 1969–1997
(97–98% of all 18-year-old men nationwide each year)
without prior diagnosis of diabetes, who underwent
standardised psychological assessment for stress resilience
(on a scale of 1–9) and were followed up for type 2 diabetes
identified from outpatient and inpatient diagnoses during
1987–2012 (maximum attained age 62 years).
Results There were 34,008 men diagnosed with type 2
diabetes in 39.4 million person-years of follow-up. Low stress
resilience was associated with an increased risk of developing
type 2 diabetes after adjusting for BMI, family history of
diabetes, and individual and neighbourhood socioeconomic
factors (HR for lowest vs highest quintile: 1.51; 95% CI
1.46, 1.57; p<0.0001), including a strong linear trend across
the full range of stress resilience (ptrend < 0.0001). This
association did not vary by BMI level, family history of
diabetes or socioeconomic factors.
Conclusions/interpretation These findings suggest that low
stress resilience may play an important long-term role in
aetiological pathways for type 2 diabetes. Further elucidation
of the underlying causal factors may help inform more
effective preventive interventions across the lifespan.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes prevalence has more than doubled among US
adults over the past three decades and now exceeds 8% [1],
and may reach one-third by 2050 [2]. Obesity and physical
inactivity are well-established risk factors, but less is known
about psychosocial effects on disease risk. Some evidence has
suggested that traumatic life events [3], job strain [4], general
emotional stress [5–7] and anxiety or depression [8, 9] are
associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
The underlying mechanisms may involve both behavioural
and stress-related physiological factors. Psychosocial stress
may contribute to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours that are
known risk factors for diabetes, such as poor dietary habits,
physical inactivity, smoking or alcohol abuse [5, 10]. Chronic
stress also activates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA) axis resulting in increased cortisol levels that may

 contribute to abdominal obesity [11, 12] and cytokine-
mediated immunologic responses that may be involved in
mediating insulin resistance [13]. As a result, resilience to
stress may be expected to be protective against type 2 diabe-
tes. However, to our knowledge, no studies have examined
whether stress resilience early in life is related to the long-term
risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Such knowledge may
provide new insights into psychosocial pathways for diabetes
and help inform more effective preventive strategies.
We conducted the first study to examine stress resilience in
late adolescence in relation to type 2 diabetes risk in adult-
hood. Stress resilience was measured using standardised psy-
chological assessments in ~1.5 million 18-year-old male mil-
itary conscripts in Sweden during 1969–1997, who were sub-
sequently followed up to a maximum age of 62 years. Our aim
was to determine whether low stress resilience in late adoles-
cence is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2
diabetes in a large national cohort.
Methods
Study population We identified 1,547,478 men (aged
18 years) who underwent a military conscription examination
during 1969–1997. This examination was compulsory for all
18-year-old men nationwide each year except for 2–3% who
were either incarcerated or had severe chronic medical condi-
tions or disabilities documented by a physician. We excluded
all 13,053 (0.8%) individuals who had a prior diagnosis of
diabetes identified from hospital discharge diagnoses. A total
of 1,534,425 (99.2% of the original cohort) remained for
inclusion in the study. This study was approved by the
Regional Ethics Committee of Lund University in Sweden.
Stress resilience ascertainment The Swedish Military
Conscription Registry contains information from a 2 day
standardised physical and psychological examination admin-
istered annually to all Swedish military conscripts starting in
1969. Stress resilience was assessed using a 20–30 min semi-
structured interview administered by a trained psychologist
[14]. The overall objective of the interview was to assess the
ability to cope with psychological requirements of military
service, including stress resilience during armed combat. In
the interview, the psychologist asked about adjustment prob-
lems and conflicts, as well as successes, responsibilities taken
on, and initiatives shown or experienced in school, work,
home or in leisure activities [14]. Emotional stability, social
maturity and active/passive interests were rated by the
psychologist, who then assigned a summary score on a
‘standardised nine’ (1 to 9) scale, which is constructed to have
a normal distribution with a mean of 5 and SD of 2. A valida-
tion study in which 30 recorded interviews from 1972 to 1973
were scored by 30 psychologists reported high interrater
reliability (correlation 0.86) [15]. Low stress resilience using
these data has previously been examined in relation to other
outcomes, including coronary heart disease [16], stroke [17]
and peptic ulcer disease [18].
Type 2 diabetes ascertainment The study cohort was
followed up through 31 December 2012 for type 2 diabetes,
which was identified using ICD diagnosis codes in the
Swedish Hospital Registry and Swedish Outpatient Regis-
try. The Swedish Hospital Registry contains all primary and
secondary hospital discharge diagnoses from six populous
counties in southern Sweden starting in 1964, and with
nationwide coverage starting in 1987; and the Swedish
Outpatient Registry contains outpatient diagnoses nation-
wide starting in 2001. Earlier ICD versions did not distin-
guish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes; therefore, we
ascertained type 2 diabetes using ICD-9 code 250
(excluding codes 250.X1 and 250.X3) during 1987–1996
(www.icd9data.com/2007/Volume1) and ICD-10 code E11
during 1997–2012 (www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/).
A sensitivity analysis was performed that further included all
diabetes diagnoses during 1969–1986 using ICD-8 code 250 in
hospital discharge records (before outpatient data were
available), of which the majority are expected to be type 2
based on inpatient data after this period.
Adjustment variables Other variables that may be associ-
ated with the risk of type 2 diabetes were obtained from the
Swedish Military Conscription Registry and national
census data, which were linked using an anonymous
personal identification number. The following were used
as adjustment variables: year of the military conscription
examination (modelled simultaneously as a continuous
and categorical [1969–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–1997]
variable); BMI (weight in kg/height in m2; modelled
alternatively as a continuous or categorical variable using
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]
definitions for children and adolescents aged 2 to 19 years
to facilitate comparability with US studies: overweight is
defined as ≥85th and <95th percentile and obesity as ≥95th
percentile on the CDC’s 2000 sex-specific BMI-for-age
growth charts, which correspond to BMI ≥25.6 and <29.0
and BMI ≥29.0, respectively, for 18-year-old men [19]);
family history of diabetes in a parent or sibling (yes or
no, identified from medical diagnoses in the Swedish
Hospital Registry from 1964 to 2012 and the Swedish
Outpatient Registry from 2001 to 2012, not self-reported,
thus enabling unbiased ascertainment); highest attained
education level during the study period (<12, 12–14,
≥15 years); and neighbourhood socioeconomic status at
baseline (SES, included because neighbourhood charac-
teristics have been associated with type 2 diabetes [20]
and with psychosocial stress [21]; comprised of an index
Diabetologia (2016) 59:728–733

 that includes low education level, low income, unemploy-
ment and social welfare receipt, as previously described
[22], and categorised as low [>1 SD below the mean],
medium [within 1 SD from the mean] or high [>1 SD
above the mean]).
A secondary analysis was performed that further adjusted
for depression and anxiety, which were ascertained using ICD
diagnosis codes in the Swedish Hospital Registry and
Swedish Outpatient Registry (depression: ICD-7 301.1,
ICD-8/9 296.2–296.3, ICD-10 F32–33; anxiety: ICD-7 310,
ICD-8/9 300.0, ICD-10 F40–41), and modelled as time-
dependent variables (older ICD codes are available at
www.wolfbane.com/icd/).
Missing data for each variable were imputed using a
standard multiple imputation procedure based on the
variable’s relationship with all other covariates [23]. Missing
data were relatively infrequent for stress resilience (7.2%),
BMI (7.2%), education level (0.4%) and neighbourhood
SES (9.1%). Data were complete for all other variables. As
an alternative to multiple imputation, sensitivity analyses were
performed after restriction to individuals with complete data
for all variables (n=1,327,760; 86.5%).
Statistical analysis Cox proportional hazards regression was
used to compute HRs and 95% CIs for the association be-
tween stress resilience level and subsequent risk of type 2
diabetes. The Cox model time scale was elapsed time since
the military conscription examination (which also corresponds
to attained age because baseline age was the same [18 years]
for all conscripts). Individuals were censored at emigration
(n=86,400; 5.6%) or death (n=58,835; 3.8%). Stress resil-
ience was modelled alternatively as a categorical variable
(1 to 9) or an ordinal variable to test for trend. Two different
adjusted models were performed: the first was adjusted for
year of the military conscription examination, and the second
was further adjusted for BMI, family history of diabetes,
education level and neighbourhood SES (as defined above).
The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by exam-
ination of loge–loge plots and was met in all models. Likeli-
hood ratio tests were used to assess for first-order interactions
between stress resilience and the model covariates in relation
to type 2 diabetes risk. All statistical tests were two-sided and
used an α-level of 0.05. All analyses were conducted using
Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Among the 1,534,425 men in this cohort, 34,008 (2.2%) were
subsequently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 39.4
million person-years of follow-up (average follow-up of
25.7 years). The median age at the end of follow-up was
46.1 years (mean 45.9 years, SD 8.9, range 19.0 to 62.0 years).
The median age at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes was 46.8 years
(mean 44.7 years, SD 9.9, range 18.0 to 62.0 years).
Stress resilience Figure 1 shows the distribution of stress
resilience scores (on a scale of 1–9) in men who did or did
not develop type 2 diabetes. Low stress resilience was associ-
ated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes
(Table 1). In the fully adjusted model, men in the lowest quin-
tile of stress resilience had a 1.5-fold risk of type 2 diabetes
relative to those in the highest quintile (adjusted HR, 1.51;
95% CI 1.46, 1.57). There was a highly significant linear trend
in the risk of type 2 diabetes across the full range of stress
resilience (ptrend<0.0001). Figure 2 shows the adjusted HRs
and 95% CIs for type 2 diabetes across the full range of stress
resilience, relative to men with average resilience as the
reference group. A steep slope of increasing risk is seen for
men with below-average stress resilience, whereas above-
average resilience is slightly protective relative to the mean.
Other risk factors High BMI was the strongest risk factor
for development of type 2 diabetes. Obese men (≥95th
percentile on the CDC’s 2000 sex-specific BMI-for-age
growth chart) had more than a sixfold risk, and overweight
men (≥85th and <95th percentile) had more than a threefold
risk, relative to those with normal BMI (Table 1, adjusted
model 2). A first-degree family history of diabetes was
associated with more than a twofold risk of developing type
2 diabetes (Table 1). High education was associated with
lower risk (ptrend < 0.0001). In the fully adjusted model,
neighbourhood SES had a backward J-shaped relationship
with type 2 diabetes risk, with highest risk corresponding to
low neighbourhood SES and a modestly increased risk with
high neighbourhood SES, relative to the intermediate group
(Table 1).

 There was no evidence of statistical or biologically
meaningful interaction between stress resilience and
BMI, family history, education level or neighbourhood
SES in relation to type 2 diabetes risk. For example,
among men with normal BMI, overweight or obesity,
respectively, the adjusted HRs for lowest vs highest
quintile of stress resilience were 1.51 (95% CI 1.45,
1.57; p < 0.001), 1.50 (95% CI 1.36, 1.66; p < 0.001) and
1.52 (95% CI 1.33, 1.73; p < 0.001) (pinteraction = 0.17).
Further adjustment for depression (n = 54,553; 3.6%) and
anxiety (n = 58,926; 3.8%) also had minimal effect on the
results (e.g. adjusted HR for lowest vs highest quintile of
stress resilience: 1.49; 95% CI 1.44, 1.54; p < 0.001). In
sensitivity analyses that included diabetes diagnoses from
1969–1986 (for which type 1 and type 2 could not be
distinguished), or that were restricted to individuals
without any missing data, all risk estimates were very
similar to the main results (data not shown).
Discussion
In this large national cohort study, we found that low stress
resilience in 18-year-old men was associated with an in-
creased risk of developing type 2 diabetes during an average
follow-up of ~25 years, independently of BMI at baseline,

 family history or socioeconomic factors. These findings
suggest that psychosocial function and ability to cope with
stress may play an important long-term role in aetiological
pathways for type 2 diabetes. Additional studies will be
needed to elucidate the specific underlying causal factors,
which may help inform more effective preventive interven-
tions across the lifespan.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine stress
resilience in late adolescence in relation to diabetes risk in
adulthood. Most previous studies have focused on stressful
experiences later in adulthood in relation to diabetes. For
example, a cross-sectional study of 2,262 Dutch middle-
aged adults reported that major stressful life events (e.g., death
of a family member) in the past 5 years was associated with a
higher risk of type 2 diabetes and with an increased waist-to-
hip ratio [3]. A pooled cohort study of 124,808 European
adults reported that job strain was associated with a modestly
higher risk of type 2 diabetes among both men and women [4].
Other studies have reported that general emotional stress [5],
feelings of anger [6], hostility [7], and anxiety or depression
[8, 9] are risk factors for type 2 diabetes. A Swedish study of
237,980 military conscripts (a subset of the present study
cohort) found that low stress resilience was associated with a
modestly increased risk of coronary heart disease, but did not
examine diabetes or other risk factors for heart disease [16].
High BMI, which was measured at age 18 years, was the
strongest risk factor for diabetes in this cohort. The risk
estimates that we observed (more than sixfold and threefold
risk for obese and overweight men, respectively) are consis-
tent with previously reported estimates for BMI measured in
adulthood [24]. The more than twofold risk we observed
among men with a family history of diabetes, and the inverse
relationship between education level and diabetes risk, are
also in agreement with previous findings [25, 26]. In addition,
we found that low neighbourhood SES was associated with a
higher risk of type 2 diabetes, consistent with previously
reported associations between neighbourhood characteristics
and diabetes risk, including studies of neighbourhood
deprivation and built environment in Sweden [20].
The mechanisms by which stress resilience may influence
the development of type 2 diabetes are probably complex and
involve unhealthy lifestyle behaviours as well as other
physiological factors. A Danish cohort study of 7,066 adults
with 10 years of follow-up found that self-reported perceived
stress was associated with subsequent physical inactivity and
unsuccessful smoking cessation or alcohol reduction among
men and women, and development of diabetes among men
[5]. Anxiety and depression are also associated with physical
inactivity, unhealthy diet and smoking [10]. In addition,
hormonal and immunological factors that are involved in
stress reactions may play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2
diabetes. Many forms of stress can activate the HPA axis,
resulting in increased synthesis and release of cortisol, which
contributes to lipolysis, body fat redistribution favouring
visceral adiposity and insulin resistance [11]. Chronic stress
also activates the innate immune system, resulting in increased
levels of interleukin 6 and other cytokine mediators of the
acute-phase response, which are involved in mediating insulin
resistance and are strong predictors of type 2 diabetes [13].
Additional studies with longitudinal behavioural and physio-
logical measurements are needed to delineate the most critical
factors and windows of susceptibility across the lifespan.
The strengths of this study include its large national cohort
design with prospective ascertainment of stress resilience and
type 2 diabetes. This study was the first with sufficient
follow-up to examine stress resilience in late adolescence in
relation to diabetes in adulthood. Stress resilience was
assessed using systematic interviews by trained psychologists
with high interrater reliability. The national cohort design
prevented selection bias, and the use of prospectively obtained
registry data prevented bias that may result from self-
reporting. We were able to adjust for other established risk
factors for type 2 diabetes, including BMI, family history
and socioeconomic factors, which were also prospectively
ascertained and not self-reported.
Limitations include a lack of information on certain other
diabetes risk factors, such as smoking and diet. The associa-
tion we observed between low stress resilience and type 2
diabetes is not necessarily causal and potentially may be
explained by unmeasured confounders. The study was based
on Swedish military conscripts; therefore, the cohort consisted
entirely of men, and it is uncertain how the findings would
compare in women. A much smaller Danish cohort study
reported that perceived stress was associated with unhealthy
behaviours among both men and women, but with diabetes
only among men, although the sex-specific CIs were wide and
overlapped [5]. The present cohort was also relatively young

 (median attained age 46 years). Additional follow-up to older
ages will be needed whenever feasible in this or other cohorts.
In addition, outpatient diagnoses in the present study were
available starting in 2001, and hence type 2 diabetes prior to
this period was under-reported. This under-reporting is
expected to be nondifferential with respect to stress resilience
level, and therefore to influence results toward the null
hypothesis.
In summary, this large national cohort study is the first to
examine stress resilience in late adolescence in relation to
diabetes risk in adulthood. We found that low stress resilience
is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes.
Further elucidation of the underlying pathways may help
improve preventive strategies by addressing important
psychosocial factors across the lifespan.
