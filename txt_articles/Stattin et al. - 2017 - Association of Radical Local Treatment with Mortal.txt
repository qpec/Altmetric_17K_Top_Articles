Abstract
Background: Current guidelines recommend androgen deprivation therapy only for men
with very high-risk prostate cancer (PCa), but there is little evidence to support this stance.
Objective: To investigate the association between radical local treatment and mortality in
men with very high-risk PCa.
Design, setting, and participants: Semiecologic study of men aged <80 yr within the Prostate
Cancer data Base Sweden, diagnosed in 1998–2012 with very high-risk PCa (local clinical
stage T4 and/or prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level 50–200 ng/ml, any N, and M0). Men with
locally advanced PCa (local clinical stage T3 and PSA level <50 ng/ml, any N, and M0) were
used as positive controls.
Intervention: Proportion of men who received prostatectomy or full-dose radiotherapy in
640 experimental units defined by county, diagnostic period, and age at diagnosis.
Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: PCa and all-cause mortality rate ratios
(MRRs).
Results and limitations: Both PCa and all-cause mortality were half as high in units in the
highest tertile of exposure to radical local treatment compared with units in the lowest tertile
(PCa MRR: 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.28–0.95; and all-cause MRR: 0.56; 95% CI,
0.33–0.92). The results observed for locally advanced PCa for highest versus lowest tertile of
exposure were in agreement with results from randomized trials (PCa MRR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.60–
0.94; and all-cause MRR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72–1.00). Although the semiecologic design mini-
mized selection bias on an individual level, the effect of high therapeutic activity could not be
separated from that of high diagnostic activity.
Conclusions: The substantially lower mortality in units with the highest exposure to radical
local treatment suggests that radical treatment decreases mortality even in men with very
high-risk PCa for whom such treatment has been considered ineffective.
Patient summary: Men with very high-risk prostate cancer diagnosed and treated in units with
the highest exposure to surgery or radiotherapy had a substantially lower mortality.

Introduction
There is no randomized controlled trial (RCT), to our
knowledge, on the effect of radical local treatment in men
with prostate cancer (PCa) in the ‘‘gray zone’’ between
locally advanced and metastatic PCa. This risk category is
often referred to as very high-risk PCa and is defined by local
invasion into adjacent organs or very high levels of serum
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) together with negative
imaging findings for metastasis [1–4]. The prognosis is
poor, and radical local treatment has generally not been
considered beneficial, as the local tumor often is too
advanced to eradicate and there is a high likelihood of
undetected micrometastases. Consequently, clinical guide-
lines recommend androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) only
for men with very high-risk PCa [1,2]. The only studies on
radical local treatment for men with very high-risk PCa are
small and retrospective [4–10]. These studies reported
longer survival in men who underwent radical prostatec-
tomy or full-dose radiotherapy than in men who received
ADT
only.
The
comparisons
of
treatment
effects
in
observational studies are hampered by selection bias
because most patients selected for radical local treatment
have less adverse cancer characteristics than patients not
receiving that treatment. Even if prognostic factors such as
stage, grade, and PSA level are included in the analysis, there
will be residual confounding in observational studies based
on an analysis of treatment exposure on an individual level
[11].
The use of radical local treatment for very high-risk PCa
has varied during the past 15 years between Swedish
counties, which are geographically well-defined adminis-
trative units providing health care to the entire population
in their catchment area. This [16_TD$DIF]provided a natural experiment,
allowing us to investigate the association of radical local
treatment with mortality from very high-risk PCa in a
semiecologic study in which the effects of selection bias for
exposure to treatment on an individual level [17_TD$DIF]were mini-
mized and comprehensive individual-level data on cancer
characteristics, treatment, and outcome could still be used.
There is consistent evidence from RCTs that radiotherapy
combined with ADT improves survival of men with locally
advanced PCa [12–17]. To assess the validity of our results[18_TD$DIF]
for very high-risk PCa, we also investigated the association
between radical local treatment for locally advanced PCa
and mortality with the same method as a positive control.
The plausibility of our observations for the treatment effect
on very high-risk PCa would be strengthened if we observed
an association between radical local treatment of locally
advanced PCa and mortality similar to the effect reported
from the RCTs.
The aim of this study was to assess the association
between radical local treatment and mortality in men with
very high-risk PCa by relating exposure to radical local
treatment on a population level in experimental units,
defined by county, period, and age at diagnosis, to mortality
from PCa and all causes using comprehensive individual-
level
data
on
cancer
characteristics,
treatment,
and
outcome.
2.
Methods
Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden (PCBaSe) 3.0 contains
information obtained from the National Prostate Cancer
Register (NPCR) of Sweden on cancer characteristics at
diagnosis and on primary treatment [18–20]. PCBaSe also
includes information on comorbidity, assessed by the
Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) based on discharge
diagnosis
from
the
[19_TD$DIF]Patient
[20_TD$DIF]Registry;
education
level,
income, and marital status from the LISA database; and
cause and date of death obtained from the[3_TD$DIF] Cause of Death
Registry [21–25]. The study population within PCBaSe for
this study included men aged <80 yr of age diagnosed in
1998–2012 with very high-risk PCa (T4 and/or PSA level 50–
200 ng/ml, any N, and M0). To assess the validity of our
method, we separately studied the association of local
treatment and mortality in men with locally advanced PCa
(local clinical stage T3 and PSA level <50 ng/ml, any N, and
M0). Registration in NPCR does not distinguish clinical local
stage T3a from T3b.
The following variables in PCBaSe were used: age, year of
PCa diagnosis, mode of detection, clinical local tumor stage,
N stage, PSA level, Gleason score, CCI, educational level,
marital status, primary registered treatment in NPCR, and
county of residence.[4_TD$DIF] Gleason [21_TD$DIF]grade [2_TD$DIF]was grouped according
to the five-tier Gleason grading groups [26,27]. NPCR
includes comprehensive information on radiotherapy since
2008; for men diagnosed before 2008, data were retrieved
directly from[6_TD$DIF] oncological radiotherapy information systems
and local databases in oncology departments on type of
radiotherapy, treatment time, total dose, and fractions in
RetroRad ([23_TD$DIF]Retrospective [24_TD$DIF]Registration of [25_TD$DIF]Radiotherapy, a
nation wide audit) [28]. There are currently 20 counties in
Sweden, and a large majority of health care including
diagnostic and therapeutic activity for PCa is provided in the
county of residence of the patient within a tax-financed
equal access system. The study was approved by the
Research Ethics Board at Umea
˚ University.
2.1.
Statistical methods
Exposure was measured as the proportion of men who
received primary radical local treatment, that is, radical
prostatectomy or full-dose radiotherapy with or without
ADT within 1 yr of diagnosis, for very high-risk and locally
advanced
PCa
in
640
experimental
units
based
on
diagnostic county, 2-yr diagnostic periods (plus 2012),
and age at diagnosis (<65, 65–69, 70–74, and 75–79 yr). For
each experimental unit, the person-years at risk from date
of diagnosis until death, emigration, or end of study period
(December 31, 2013), whichever event came first, were
calculated. In a Poisson model, the logarithm of person-
years at risk was used as offset; the numbers of PCa-related
deaths and deaths from any cause were used as outcome.
Results are presented as mortality rate ratio (MRR) with 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) for exposure in tertiles and
continuous as a restricted cubic spline. The models included
county as a categorical variable, year of diagnosis as a
continuous variable, median Gleason grade groups as a
E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y 7 2 ( 2 0 1 7 ) 1 2 5 – 1 3 4

 restricted cubic spline, mean PSA level, and CCI dichoto-
mized into 0 vs �1. Separate models were fitted for each age
group, and a model for all ages combined was also fitted by
including age group as a covariate. Multiple imputation was
used to handle missing Gleason grade groups with the
multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE)
algorithm [29]. The Gleason grade groups were imputed
20 times using all variables in Table 1 as predictors in the
MICE algorithm. A separate model was fitted to the data set
in each iteration and the results were then pooled using
Rubin’s rules [30]. The p value for trend was calculated by
including exposure in the model as a continuous variable.
Mortality rates per 1000 person-years were calculated by
specifying different levels of exposure in the Poisson model
and by using the underlying distribution for the other
covariates
values. All
tests were two-sided, and
the
significance level was set to p < 0.05. Statistical analysis
was performed with R v.3.1.2 software (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Results
There were 106 204 men aged <80 yr diagnosed with PCa in
Sweden during the study period. Of these, 7500 men (7%)
had very high-risk PCa and 10316 men (10%) had locally
advanced PCa; for these men, there was a gradual increase
in exposure to radical local treatment in most counties
during the study period (Fig. 1) and an increase in the
proportion receiving radical treatment in all age groups
(Fig. 2). For instance, the proportion of men aged <65 yr
with very high-risk PCa who received radical treatment
increased from 21% in 1998–1999 to 41% in 2012, whereas
the corresponding increase for locally advanced PCa was
from 46% to 79%. There was a more than nine-fold difference
between the counties with the highest and lowest propor-
tions of radical treatment for very high-risk PCa (28% vs 3%,
respectively) and more than two-fold difference of radical
treatment for locally advanced PCa (53% vs 20%, respective-
ly) during the full study period in all age groups combined.
The use of radical treatment for very high-risk PCa and
locally advanced PCa in each county according to calendar
year is depicted in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2.
Clinical characteristics and cancer treatment for men
with very high-risk and locally advanced PCa are presented
in Table 1. Men in the units in the highest tertile of exposure
to radical local treatment compared with men in units with
the lowest exposure were younger and had lower PSA
levels, fewer comorbidities, and fewer missing data for
complete Gleason classification (3% vs 26%, respectively). In
an analysis ignoring the restriction to M0 in the very high-
risk group, 92% vs 65% of men had undergone bone imaging
in the units with highest and lowest exposure, respectively
(Supplementary Table 1).
Full-dose radiotherapy combined with ADT was the most
common radical treatment; 8% of men with very high-risk
PCa and 19% of men with locally advanced PCa received this
treatment in the full study population. Details on the
delivered radiotherapy are presented in Supplementary
Table 2. Age was a strong determinant of receipt of radical
local treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3). Among men with
very high-risk PCa, radical treatment was used in 32% of
men aged <65 yr but only 2% of men aged 75–79 yr, and the
corresponding proportions for men with locally advanced
PCa were 66% and 6%, respectively.
3.1.
Mortality according to exposure to local treatment
Men with very high-risk PCa in the units in the highest
tertile of exposure to radical local treatment had half the
mortality of men in the lowest tertile (PCa MRR: 0.51; 95%
CI, 0.28–0.95; and all-cause MRR: 0.56; 95% CI, 0.33–0.92)
(Table 2 and Fig. 3). The association between radical
treatment and PCa mortality for highest versus lowest
tertile of exposure was observed in all age groups up to 75 yr
(age <65 yr, MRR: 0.64; 95% CI, 0.30–1.38; age 65–69 yr,
MRR: 0.32; 95% CI, 0.10–1.02; and age 70–74 yr, MRR: 0.88;
95% CI, 0.12–6.41). The absolute PCa-specific mortality for
men with very high-risk PCa was 30 per 1000 person-years
in the highest tertile of treatment and 58 per 1000 person-
years in the lowest tertile; the absolute all-cause mortality
for men with very high-risk PCa was 44 per 1000 person-
years in the highest tertile and 79 per 1000 person-years in
the lowest tertile.
Mortality in men with locally advanced PCa was also
related to exposure to radical local treatment for the
highest versus lowest tertile of exposure (PCa MRR: 0.75;
95% CI, 0.60–0.94; and all-cause MRR: 0.85; 95% CI, 0.72–
1.00). The association between radical treatment and PCa
mortality was observed in all age groups up to 75 yr (age
<65 yr, MRR: 0.75; 95% CI, 0.55–1.03; age 65–69 yr, MRR:
0.73; 95% CI, 0.51–1.04; and age 70–74 yr, MRR: 0.36; 95%
CI,
0.11–1.13).
All
comparisons
between
tertiles
of
exposure to radical treatment showed a statistically
significant
association
with
PCa
and
all-cause
MRR
(p < 0.05). Too few men aged >75 yr received radical
treatment to allow a separate analysis in this age group
(Supplementary Fig. 3).

Discussion
In men with very high-risk PCa, mortality from PCa and that
from all causes were half as high in[7_TD$DIF] units with the highest
exposure to radical local treatment as in the units with the
lowest exposure in this semiecologic, nationwide, popula-
tion-based study. This strong association suggests that
radical local treatment decreases mortality even in men
with very high-risk PCa for whom radical treatment has
previously been considered ineffective.
The semiecologic study design has several strengths
[31,32]. Exposure to treatment could be assessed on a
population level, which minimized selection bias on an
individual level, while at the same time comprehensive,
high-quality individual-level data for cancer characteristics,
comorbidity, cancer treatment, and cause of death could be
used [18–20,28].
Residual
confounding

 treatment, and there may have been factors unrelated to
treatment causing the lower mortality in these counties.
Although the analysis was adjusted for county and year of
diagnosis, there may have been interactions between these
two factors that were left unaccounted for. High exposure
to radical local treatment was linked to high exposure to
staging investigations, including bone and lymph node
imaging and complete Gleason classification. The design of
the study allowed for an investigation of the association of a
high diagnostic activity and a high therapeutic activity,
assessed on a population level, with oncological outcome,
assessed on an individual level, but the effects of diagnostic
and therapeutic activity could not be separated.
Most men aged <75 yr with very high-risk PCa die of
their cancer [33,34]. Despite this, radical local treatment of
the primary tumor in addition to ADT has only been

 evaluated in some reports from small, single-institution
case series [4–10]. These studies reported longer survival
for men with very high-risk PCa who received full-dose
radiotherapy or prostatectomy in addition to ADT, but
selection bias cannot be ruled out as the only cause of these
findings.
In
contrast,
multimodal
treatment
of
very
advanced breast cancer is a well-researched area. There is
strong evidence from RCTs that combinations of local and
systemic treatment prolong survival, and combined treat-
ment has long been the standard of care for women with
very advanced breast cancer [35].
RCTs of ADT and radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy
in men with very high-risk PCa (with or without confirmed
limited metastatic spread) are ongoing [36–40], but their
results will not be available for many years. Results
from large, well-designed studies based on registers with
high-quality data can fill the current lack of evidence. This
study included virtually all PCa cases in an entire nation,
with comprehensive data from high-quality health care
registries and demographic databases on cancer character-
istics, cancer treatment, comorbidity, socioeconomic fac-
tors,
and
health
care
providers
[18–20].
We
also
investigated the association between radical local treat-
ment and mortality from locally advanced PCa (local clinical
stage T3). The magnitude of the association between high
exposure to radical local treatment and the decrease in
mortality in men with locally advanced PCa was in
accordance with the effect of local treatment reported
from RCTs [12–17], implying that the methods we used
yielded accurate risk estimates.
In this study, lymph node metastasis detected at surgery
(pN1) was not used as an inclusion criterion because men

 with pN1 detected at prostatectomy for clinically localized
PCa have a better prognosis than men with stage T4 cancer
or a PSA level of 50–200 ng/ml [8,33]. Had pN1 disease been
included in the very high-risk PCa group, more men in this
subgroup with favorable prognosis would have been
included in units with high exposure to radical local
treatment, and this would have introduced selection bias.

Conclusions
In this semiecologic, nationwide, population-based study,
mortality among men with very high-risk PCa (defined as
local stage T4, PSA level 50–200 ng/ml, and M0) in
experimental units with the highest exposure to radical
local treatment was half that from PCa and all causes in
units with the lowest exposure. This suggests that radical
local treatment decreases mortality in men with very high-
risk PCa for whom radical treatment has previously been
considered ineffective. RCTs are needed to conclusively
evaluate the effect of radical local treatment in men with
very high-risk PCa[1_TD$DIF].

Note to Reader
The authors would like to state that Sooriakumaran et al
were the first to use Prostate Cancer data Base Sweden
(PCBaSe) data to investigate the association between
radical treatment and prostate cancer mortality in men
with very advanced prostate cancer [41]. Sooriakumaran
et al analysed a previous version of PCBaSe and in 2014
reported a lower mortality in men who received radical
local treatment than in those who received androgen
deprivation
therapy
only.
The
analysis
included
a
comparison of the cumulative mortality, multivariable
regression, competing risk analysis, and propensity score
analysis.
