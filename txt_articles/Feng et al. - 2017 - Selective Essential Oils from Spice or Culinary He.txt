Although the majority of patients with acute Lyme disease can be cured with the standard 
2–4 week antibiotic treatment, about 10–20% of patients continue suffering from chronic 
symptoms described as posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome. While the cause for 
this is debated, one possibility is that persister bacteria are not killed by the current 
Lyme antibiotics and remain active in the system. It has been reported that essential 
oils have antimicrobial activities and some have been used by patients with persisting 
Lyme disease symptoms. However, the activity of essential oils against the causative 
agent Borrelia burgdorferi (B. burgdorferi) has not been well studied. Here, we evalu-
ated the activity of 34 essential oils against B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture as a 
model for persister bacteria. We found that not all essential oils had activity against the 
 
B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture, with top five essential oils (oregano, cinnamon 
bark, clove bud, citronella, and wintergreen) at a low concentration of 0.25% showing 
high anti-persister activity that is more active than the known persister drug daptomycin. 
Interestingly, some highly active essential oils were found to have excellent anti-biofilm 
ability as shown by their ability to dissolve the aggregated biofilm-like structures. The 
top three hits, oregano, cinnamon bark, and clove bud completely eradicated all viable 
cells without any regrowth in subculture in fresh medium, whereas but not citronella 
and wintergreen did not have this effect. Carvacrol was found to be the most active 
ingredient of oregano oil showing excellent activity against B. burgdorferi stationary 
phase cells, while other ingredients of oregano oil p-cymene and α-terpinene had no 
apparent activity. Future studies are needed to characterize and optimize the active 
essential oils in drug combination studies in vitro and in vivo and to address their safety 
and pharmacokinetic properties before they can be considered as a novel treatment of 
persistent Lyme disease.

Anti-Borrelia Activity of Essential Oils

Lyme disease or Borreliosis is the most common vector borne 
illness in the United States with an estimated 300,000 cases per 
year (1). The illness is transmitted by a tick bite and in some 
endemic areas, where more than 40% of the ticks are infected 
with the causative agent of Borreliosis, Borrelia burgdorferi 
sensu lato complex species, which increases the risk of trans-
mission to human host (2).
The difficulty in the clinical management of Borreliosis is 
that the current treatment regimen recommended for acute 
stage of illness of 21 days of Doxycycline (Dox) (3) leaves 
over 20% of patients with chronic symptoms that can last over 
6 months (4). These chronic symptoms can be debilitating 
fatigue, muscular and joint pain, and cognitive and neurologic 
impairment. While we do not yet understand the full spectrum 
of etiologies, research evidence in animal studies illuminates 
that persistence of infection is one of them. The persistence of 
the organism after antibiotic treatment is seen in dogs (5), mice 
(6, 7), monkeys (8), as well as humans (9), but viable organisms 
are very difficult to be cultured from the host after antibiotic 
treatment.
Once the disease has been acquired, it can spread from the 
skin to various secondary organs throughout the body, includ-
ing heart, joints, peripheral and central nervous system (10). 
The early stage of the illness tends to be easier to cure, but it can 
become more difficult to treat when the disease has progressed 
to late stage (11). This further challenges conventional antibiotic 
monotherpy such as intravenous ceftriaxone, which has not 
been proven successful with a subset of patients presenting with 
complex chronic symptoms (12).
One of the reasons for this failure, clinically relatable, would 
be that the host is infected with organisms that are enriched in 
variant persister forms or the disease when not treated in early 
stage can progress allowing persisters to further develop (round 
bodies and biofilm-like microcolonies and larger aggregated bio-
film structures). Analogous variant atypical persister forms can 
be found in stationary phase cultures and under stress conditions 
such as starvation and antibiotic exposures (13–15). It is worth 
noting that the current antibiotics used to treat Lyme disease 
such as Dox, amoxicillin, and cefuroxime (CefU) are highly 
active against the growing spirochetal form of B. burgdorferi but 
have poor activity against the atypical persister forms (round 
bodies, microcolonies, and biofilm) enriched in stationary phase 
cultures (14–17). These persister forms that are not killed by the 
current Lyme antibiotics may underlie the persistent symptoms 
in patients despite the standard antibiotic treatment.
To identify drugs that target the persister forms, we screened 
FDA-approved drug library and NCI compound libraries (14, 18) 
against stationary phase cultures enriched in round bodies and 
microcolonies as well as antibiotic-induced round body persisters 
(19). Using these models, we identified a range of drugs such as 
daptomycin (Dap), clofazimine, anthracycline antibiotics, and 
sulfa drugs, etc., which have good activity against the Borrelia 
persister forms. However, some of these persister-active agents 
are either very expensive, difficult to administer, and have to be 
given intravenously, or have significant side effects.
Essential oils are concentrated volatile liquids that are extracted 
from plants, most of which are used as spices and culinary herbs. 
It has been reported in the literature that essential oils have anti-
microbial activities (20), and anecdotal patient reports from the 
internet suggest that some essential oils may improve symptoms of 
patients with persistent Lyme disease (http://essentialoiladvocate.
info/2015/11/6-essential-oils-to-help-fight-lyme-disease.html/; 
http://paulaquinlan.com/products/therapeutic-essential-oils/; 
http://drericz.com/beating-lyme-disease-with-essential-oils/). 
However, only one study has been done, which assessed the 
activity of essential oils on B. burgdorferi, where it showed that 
volatile oil from Cistus creticus has growth inhibiting activity on 
growing B. burgdorferi (21). Because the current Lyme antibiotics 
(e.g., Dox, amoxicillin, CefU) are already very good at killing the 
log phase B. burgdorferi but have poor activity against stationary 
phase B. burgdorferi (14, 16, 17). In addition, it is the dormant 
persister forms enriched in stationary phase cultures (often in 
variant morphological forms such as round bodies and micro-
colonies and biofilm) that may be involved in persistent infection 
that is not cured by the current Lyme antibiotics. Moreover, no 
study has been performed to evaluate the activity of essential 
oils on non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi persisters. 
Thus, the purpose of this study is to comprehensively evaluate 
the activity of essential oils for activity against the more difficult 
to kill persister forms of B. burgdorferi that are enriched in the 
stationary phase culture (22). To achieve this goal, we screened 
a panel of essential oils from common commercial sources for 
activities against B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells and found 
that not all essential oils have activity against B. burgdorferi, with 
oregano, cinnamon bark, and clove bud having among the high-
est anti-persister activity in vitro.

strain, Media, and culture Techniques
Low passaged (less than eight passages) B. burgdorferi strain 
B31 5A19 was kindly provided by Dr. Monica Embers (16). 
The B. burgdorferi B31 strain was grown in BSK-H medium 
(HiMedia Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.) and supplemented with 6% 
rabbit serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). All culture 
medium was filter-sterilized by 0.2 µm filter. Cultures were 
incubated in sterile 50 ml conical tubes (BD Biosciences, CA, 
USA) in microaerophilic incubator (33°C, 5% CO2) without 
antibiotics. After incubation for 7 days, 1 ml stationary-phase 
B. burgdorferi culture (~107 spirochetes per milliliter) was 
transferred into a 96-well plate for evaluation of potential anti-
persister activity of essential oils (see below).
essential Oils and Drugs
A panel of commercially available essential oils was purchased 
from Plant Therapy (ID, USA), Natural Acres (MO, USA), or 
Plant Guru (NJ, USA). Carvacrol, p-cymene, and α-terpinene 
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Essential oils were 
added to BSK-H medium or B. burgdorferi cultures to form 
aqueous emulsion suspensions by vigorous vortexing, followed 
immediately by serially diluting the essential oil suspensions to

desired concentrations into B. burgdorferi cultures. Essential 
oils were also dissolved in organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO) at 20%, followed by dilution at 1:20 into 7-day-old sta-
tionary phase culture to 1% final concentration. To make further 
dilutions for evaluating anti-Borrelia activity, the 1% essential oils 
were further diluted with the stationary phase culture to achieve 
desired dilutions. Dox, CefU (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and (Dap) 
(AK Scientific, Inc., USA) were dissolved in suitable solvents 
(23, 24) to form 5 mg/ml stock solutions. The antibiotic stocks 
were filter-sterilized by 0.2 µm filter and stored at −20°C.
Microscopy
The B. burgdorferi cultures were examined using BZ-X710 All-
in-One fluorescence microscope (KEYENCE, Inc.). The SYBR 
Green I/PI viability assay was performed to assess the bacterial 
viability using the ratio of green/red fluorescence to determine 
the live:dead cell ratio, respectively, as described previously 
 
(14, 22). This residual cell viability reading was confirmed by ana-
lyzing three representative images of the bacterial culture using 
epifluorescence microscopy. BZ-X Analyzer and Image Pro-Plus 
software were used to quantitatively determine the fluorescence 
intensity.
evaluation of essential Oils for Their 
activities against B. burgdorferi  
stationary Phase cultures
To evaluate the activity of essential oils, aliquots of the essential 
oils or drugs were added to 96-well plate containing 100 µL of 
the 7-day-old stationary phase B. burgdorferi culture to obtain 
the desired concentrations. In the primary essential oil screen, 
each essential oil was assayed in four concentrations, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 
and 0.125% (v/v) in 96-well plate. Dap, Dox, and CefU were 
used as control drugs at 40, 20, 10, and 5 µM, respectively, since 
this drug combination has been shown to completely eradicate 
B. burgdorferi persisters in our previous studies (15, 25). The 
active hits were further confirmed with lower 0.1 and 0.05% 
concentration; all tests were run in triplicate. All the plates were 
incubated at 33°C and 5% CO2 without shaking for 7 days when 
the residual viable cells remaining were measured using the 
SYBR Green I/PI viability assay and epifluorescence microscopy 
as described (14, 22).
antibiotic susceptibility Testing
To qualitatively determine the effect of essential oils in a high-
throughput manner, 10 µl of each essential oil from the prediluted 
stock was added to 7-day-old stationary phase B. burgdorferi 
culture in the 96-well plate. Plates were sealed and placed in 33°C 
incubator for 7 days when the SYBR Green I/PI viability assay was 
used to assess the live and dead cells as described (14). Briefly, 
10 µl of SYBR Green I (10,000× stock, Invitrogen) was mixed with 
30 µl propidium iodide (PI, 20 mM, Sigma) into 1.0 ml of sterile 
dH2O. Then 10 µl staining mixture was added to each well and 
mixed thoroughly. The plates were incubated at room tempera-
ture in the dark for 15 min followed by plate reading at excitation 
wavelength at 485 nm and the fluorescence intensity at 535 nm 
(green emission) and 635 nm (red emission) in microplate reader 
(HTS 7000 plus Bio Assay Reader, PerkinElmer Inc., USA). 
 
With least-square fitting analysis, the regression equation and 
regression curve of the relationship between percentage of live 
and dead bacteria as shown in green/red fluorescence ratios 
was obtained. The regression equation was used to calculate the 
percentage of live cells in each well of the 96-well plate.
The standard microdilution method was used to determine 
the MIC of carvacrol, based on inhibition of visible growth of 
 
B. burgdorferi by microscopy. Carvacrol was added to B. burg­
dorferi cultures (1 × 104 spirochetes per milliliters) to form 
aqueous suspension by vortex. The carvacrol suspension was 
twofold diluted from 0.5% (equivalent to 4.88 µg/ml) to 0.008% 
(equivalent to 0.08 µg/ml). All experiments were run in tripli-
cate. B. burgdorferi culture was incubated in 96-well microplate 
at 33°C for 7 days. Cell proliferation was assessed using the 
SYBR Green I/PI assay and BZ-X710 All-in-One fluorescence 
microscope (KEYENCE, Inc.).
subculture studies to assess Viability  
of the essential Oil-Treated B. burgdorferi 
Organisms
A 7-day-old B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture (500 µl) was 
treated with essential oils or control drugs for 7 days in 1.5 ml 
Eppendorf tubes as described previously (15). After incubation 
at 33°C for 7 days without shaking, the cells were collected by 
centrifugation and rinsed with 1 ml fresh BSK-H medium fol-
lowed by resuspension in 500 µl fresh BSK-H medium without 
antibiotics. Then 50 µl of cell suspension was transferred to 
1 ml fresh BSK-H medium for subculture at 33°C for 20 days. 
Cell proliferation was assessed using SYBR Green I/PI assay and 
epifluorescence microscopy as described above.
resUlTs
evaluation of essential Oils for activity 
against stationary Phase B. burgdorferi
We evaluated a panel of 34 essential oils at four different concen-
trations (1, 0.5, 0.25, and 0.125%) for activity against a 7-day-old 
B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture in the 96-well plates with 
control drugs for 7 days. Consistent with our previous studies 
(14, 25), Dap included as a persister drug control was shown to 
have higher activity against the B. burgdorferi stationary phase 
culture than the currently used antibiotics such as Dox and 
CefU for treating Lyme disease (Table 1), with a dose-dependent 
increase in killing activity. We used 40 µM Dap (64.8 µg/ml) as a 
positive persister drug control because this is a clinically achiev-
able concentration that could cause near complete clearance of 
B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells while the current Lyme anti-
biotics could not (14, 15) (Figure 1). Five essential oils (bandit, 
oregano, clove bud, geranium bourbon, and cinnamon bark) at 
1% concentration showed more activity against the stationary 
phase B. burgdorferi culture than 40 µM Dap with the plate reader 
SYBR green I/PI assay (Table 1). We found some essential oils 
have autofluorescence, which interfered with the SYBR Green I/
PI plate reader assay; however, we were able to resolve this issue 
present in some samples by fluorescence microscopy. As we

previously described (18), we directly calculated the green (live) 
cell ratio of microscope images using Image Pro-Plus software, 
which could eliminate the background autofluorescence. Using 
the SYBR Green I/PI assay and fluorescence microscopy, we 
additionally found 18 essential oils that showed more or similar 
activity against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi at 1% con-
centration compared to the 40 µM Dap, included as a positive 
persister drug control (14), which could eradicate all live cells 
as shown by red (dead) aggregated cells (Table 1; Figure 1A). 
At 0.5% concentration, seven essential oils (oregano, cinnamon 
bark, clove bud, citronella, wintergreen, geranium bourbon, and 
patchouli dark) were found to have higher or similar activity 
against the stationary phase B. burgdorferi than 40 µM Dap by 
fluorescence microscope counting after SYBR Green I/PI assay 
(Table 1; Figure 1B). However, bandit thieves oil, while having 
good activity at 1%, had significantly less activity at 0.5% and 
lower concentrations (Table 1). Among the effective hits, five 
essential oils (oregano, cinnamon bark, clove bud, citronella, 
and wintergreen) still showed better activity than 40 µM Dap at 
0.25% concentration (Table 1; Figure 1C). Eventually, oregano, 
cinnamon bark, and clove bud were identified as the most active 
essential oils because of their remarkable activity even at the 
lowest concentration of 0.125%, which showed similar or better 
activity than 40 µM Dap (Table 1; Figure 1D).
To further compare the activity of these active essential 
oils and find whether they could eradicate stationary phase

B. burgdorferi at lower concentrations, we evaluated six essential 
oils (oregano, cinnamon bark, clove bud, citronella, geranium 
bourbon, and wintergreen) at even lower concentrations at 0.1 
and 0.05%. We noticed that oregano could not wipe out station-
ary phase B. burgdorferi at 0.05% concentration as shown by 
some residual green aggregated cells (Table 2; Figure 2), despite 
oregano showing strong activity sterilizing all the stationary 
phase B. burgdorferi cells at and above 0.1% concentration 
(Tables 1 and 2).
To address potential concern that the essential oils may 
not dissolve in culture medium well and may affect the above 
results, we diluted all the 34 essential oils in DMSO and found 
19 could be dissolved and 15 could not be dissolved in DMSO 
 
(see Table 1, Superscript c). For essential oils that can be dis-
solved in DMSO, we simultaneously dissolved them in DMSO 
and also in aqueous culture medium at the same dilutions of 
0.5, 0.1, 0.05% and evaluated their activity against the 7-day-old 
stationary phase B. burgdorferi. However, we found that there 
was no significant difference in their anti-borrelial activity when 
dissolved in DMSO or in aqueous culture medium (p = 0.138–
0.975) (see Table S1 in Supplementary Material).
carvacrol as a highly Potent active 
ingredient of Oregano Oil against 
stationary Phase B. burgdorferi
To identify active ingredients of the oregano essential oil, we 
tested three major constituents (26), carvacrol, p-cymene, and 
α-terpinene on the stationary phase B. burgdorferi. Interestingly, 
carvacrol showed similar high activity against B. burgdorferi as 
oregano essential oil either at 0.1% (6.5 µM) or 0.05% (3.2 µM) 
concentration (Table 2; Figure 2, h). Meanwhile, we also found 
that carvacrol was very active against replicating B. burgdorferi, 
as shown with a very low MIC of 0.16–0.31 µg/ml. By contrast, 
p-cymene and α-terpinene did not have activity against the 
stationary phase B. burgdorferi (Table 2; Figure 2, i,j). Thus, 
carvacrol could be one of the most active ingredients in oregano 
oil that kill stationary phase B. burgdorferi.
subculture studies to evaluate the activity 
of essential Oils against stationary Phase 
B. burgdorferi
To confirm the activity of the essential oils in killing stationary 
phase B. burgdorferi, we performed subculture studies in BSK-H 
medium as described previously (15). To validate the activity of 
these essential oils, samples of essential oil-treated cultures were 
subjected to subculture after removal of the drugs by washing fol-
lowed by incubation in fresh BSK medium for 21 days. According 
to the essential oil drug exposure experiments (Table 2), we used 
subculture to further confirm whether the top six active essential 
oils (oregano, cinnamon bark, clove bud, citronella, geranium 
bourbon, and wintergreen) could eradicate the stationary phase 
B. burgdorferi cells at 0.1 or 0.05% concentration. At 0.1% 
concentration, the subculture results were consistent with the 
above drug exposure results, and no regrowth in samples of three

treated with 0.1% (a) or 0.05% (B) essential oils (labeled on the image) or the ingredients (carvacrol, α-terpinene, or p-cymene) of oregano for 7 days followed by 
staining with SYBR Green I/PI viability assay and fluorescence microscopy.

top hits, oregano, cinnamon bark, and clove bud was observed 
(Figure 3A, b–d). However, citronella, geranium bourbon, 
and wintergreen could not completely kill the stationary phase 
 
B. burgdorferi with many spirochetes being visible after 21-day 
subculture (Figure 3A, e–g). Subculture also confirmed the 
activity of carvacrol by showing no spirochetal regrowth in the 
0.1% carvacrol-treated samples. However, in the p-cymene and 
α-terpinene subculture samples, growth in 0.1% concentration 
samples was observed. At 0.05% concentration, we observed 
no spirochetal regrowth after 21-day subculture in the oregano 
and cinnamon bark-treated samples (Figure 3B, b,c), even 
though some very tiny aggregated microcolonies were found 
after treatment (Figure 2B, b,c). Although the clove bud showed 
better activity than the cinnamon bark at 0.05% concentration 
(Table 2), it could not sterilize the B. burgdorferi stationary phase 
culture, as they all had visible spirochetes growing after 21-day 
subculture (Figure 3B, c,d). Additionally, 0.05% citronella, 
geranium bourbon, and wintergreen could not kill all stationary 
phase B. burgdorferi since many viable spirochetes were observed 
in the 21-day subculture (Figure 3B, e–g). Remarkably, 0.05% 
carvacrol sterilized the B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture as 
shown by no regrowth after 21-day subculture (Figure 3B, h).
DiscUssiOn
Previous in vitro studies showed that certain essential oils have 
antibacterial activity against multidrug resistant Gram-negative 
clinical isolates (27). In this study, we tested 34 essential oils from 
different plants on non-growing stationary phase B. burgdorferi 
as a model of persister drug screens. We were able to identify 23 
essential oils at 1% concentration that are more active than the 
control persister drug Dap (40 µM or 64.8 µg/ml) 3 of which, 
oregano, clove bud, and cinnamon bark, highlighted themselves 
as having a remarkable activity even at a very low concentration 
of 0.125% (Table 1). Among them, oregano and cinnamon bark 
essential oils demonstrated the best activity as shown by complete 
eradication of stationary phase B. burgdorferi even at 0.05% 
concentration. In a previous study, oregano oil was found to have 
antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative 
bacteria (26). Here, for the first time, we identified oregano 
oil as having a highly potent activity against stationary phase 
 
B. burgdorferi. We tested three major ingredients of oregano oil 
(carvacrol, p-cymene, and α-terpinene) on B. burgdorferi, and 
found carvacrol is the major active component, which showed 
similar activity as the complete oregano oil (Figures 2 and 3). 
 FigUre 3 | Subculture of Borrelia burgdorferi after treatment with essential oils. A B. burgdorferi stationary phase culture (7 days old) was treated with the indicated 
essential oils at 0.1% (a) or 0.05% (B) for 7 days followed by washing and resuspension in fresh BSK-H medium and subculture for 21 days. The viability of the 
subculture was examined by SYBR Green I/PI stain and fluorescence microscopy.

We could not rule out the possibility that other components may 
also have activity against B. burgdorferi. We plan to use GC/MS 
to identify components of the active essential oils and test them 
on B. burgdorferi in the future.
In addition to the above findings, we noted that oregano oil 
can dramatically reduce the size of aggregated biofilm-like micro-
colonies compared to the antibiotic controls (Figure 1). After 
treatment with 0.25% oregano essential oil, only some dispersed 
tiny red aggregated cells were left in the culture (Figure 1C). 
Interestingly, we observed that amount and size of aggregated 
biofilm-like microcolonies of B. burgdorferi dramatically reduced 
with increasing concentrations of oregano oil, as aggregated 
biofilm-like structures vanished after treatment with 0.5 or 1% 
oregano essential oil. When we reduced the concentration of 
oregano essential oil to 0.05%, it could not eradicate stationary 
phase B. burgdorferi (residual viability 56%, Figure 2B, b) but 
the size of aggregated microcolonies decreased significantly. 
 
By contrast, Dap could kill the aggregated biofilm-like microcolo-
nies of B. burgdorferi as shown by red aggregated microcolonies 
but could not break up the aggregated microcolonies even at the 
highest concentration of 40 µM (Figure 1A). It has been shown 
that carvacrol and other active compositions of oregano oil could 
disrupt microbial cell membranes (20). Future studies are needed 
to determine whether oregano oil and other active essential oils 
have similar membrane disruption activity and could destroy the 
aggregated biofilm-like structures of B. burgdorferi.
We also noted that some essential oils such as oregano and 
cinnamon bark had relatively high residual viability percent-
age (Table 2) at a low concentration of 0.05%, but the treated 
B. burgdorferi cells did not grow in the subculture experiment 
(Table 2; Figure 3B, b,c). We speculate that these essential oils 
could dissolve the dead B. burgdorferi cells presumably due to 
their high lipophilicity. The reduction of the number of dead red 
cells by the essential oil made the residual viability percentage 
increase, although the number of live cells obviously decreased 
as well (Figure 2A, b–d and Figure 2B, b,c). In addition, these 
essential oils may also permanently damage B. burgdorferi during 
the treatment, such that even in the fresh medium, the residual 
B. burgdorferi cells still could not regrow.
Meanwhile, we found that, at a high concentration (above 
1%), lemongrass or oregano essential oil showed apparent 
high residual viability percentage by the SYBR Green I/PI plate 
assay, compared with the microscopy counting data (Table 1; 
Figure 1A). This may be caused by strong autofluorescence of 
 9

these essential oils that severely interfere with the SYBR Green I/PI 
assay. We studied the emission spectra of lemongrass essential 
oil using Synergy H1 multi-mode reader and found lemongrass 
essential oil emits the strongest autofluorescence. The peak 
fluorescence of lemongrass essential oil is at 520 nm that over-
laps with the green fluorescence of SYBR Green I dye (peak is 
at 535 nm). The strong autofluorescence caused the abnormal 
residual viability percentage (above 100% in Table 1) using SYBR 
Green I/PI plate assay. We also found that the oregano essential 
oil emits autofluorescence at 535 nm, which pushed the green/
red fluorescence ratio higher than their true values (Table 1). 
We were able to solve this problem by using fluorescence micros-
copy as a more reliable measure to confirm the results of SYBR 
Green I/PI plate reader assay (14, 18).
Additionally, we found cinnamon bark and clove bud 
essential oils showed excellent activity against stationary phase 
B. burgdorferi. Cinnamon bark essential oil eradicated the sta-
tionary phase B. burgdorferi cells even at 0.05% concentration 
(Table 2) while clove bud essential oil showed sterilization at 
0.1% or above concentration. Extractions of cinnamon bark and 
clove bud have been used as flavors for food processing. Based on 
this discovery, effective oral regimens with low side effect may be 
developed to fight against Lyme disease in future studies.
In a previous study, it has been found that volatile oil from 
C. creticus showed growth inhibiting activity against growing 
B. burgdorferi in vitro (21), but its activity against station-
ary phase bacteria enriched in persisters was not evaluated. 
 
In this study, we tested six Citrus plants (Citrus bergamia, Citrus 
sinensis, Citrus limonum, Citrus aurantifolia, Citrus racemosa, 
Citrus reticulata) on the stationary phase B. burgdorferi culture 
and found bergamot (C. bergamia) had high activity (residual 
viability 12%) at 1% concentration. The other Citrus essential 
oils did not show good activity against B. burgdorferi compared 
with clinically used Dox, CefU, or Dap (Table 1).
Although we found several essential oils (oregano, cinnamon 
bark, clove bud) that have excellent activity against B. burgdorferi 
stationary phase cells in vitro (Table 1), the effective dose that 
will show equivalent activity in vivo is unknown at this time 
largely because the active ingredients in the active essential oils 
and the pharmacokinetic profile of the active ingredients are 
not all known. Future studies are needed to identify the active 
ingredients of the active essential oils and determine their effec-
tive dosage in vivo. Identification of active components or active 
component combinations from essential oils may help to elimi-
nate the quality difference of natural products such that MICs 
and MBCs of the active compounds could be tested on growing 
bacteria in future studies. We were able to identify carvacrol as 
the most active ingredient in oregano essential oil, and its phar-
macokinetics has been studied as a feed addition in pigs (28) and 
topical oil in cattle (29). In the rat model, the calculated LD50 
of carvacrol is 471.2 mg/kg (30). We noticed that the 0.05% of 
carvacrol used here, which is equivalent to 0.48 µg/ml or 3.2 µM 
and completely eradicated B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells in 
subculture (Figure 3), is lower than the peak plasma concentra-
tion (3.65 µg/ml) in the swine study (28). Clinically, an antimi-
crobial agent that penetrates the blood–brain barrier as well as 
the persistent Borrelia organisms do, would be an ideal candidate 
for further study (31). Oil of Oregano is a good candidate for this 
consideration given that its main active ingredient—carvacrol is 
a phenolic monoterpenoid that is fat-soluble and found in ani-
mal studies to have blood–brain barrier penetration (32). These 
findings favor the application of carvacrol in future treatment 
studies. Importantly, carvacrol seems to be more active than Dap, 
the most active persister drug against B. burgdorferi (14, 15). 
 
In this study, 0.1% carvacrol (6.4 µM) showed much higher activ-
ity (2% residual viability) than 5 µM Dap (45% residual viability) 
(Tables 1 and 2). In addition, 0.05% carvacrol (3.2 µM) could 
eradicate B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells with no regrowth 
in subculture, by contrast, 10 µg/ml Dap (6.2 µM), could not 
completely kill B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells as shown 
by regrowth in subculture (15). Furthermore, we know that the 
drug’s activity against non-replicating bacteria is not always 
consistent with its activity against growing bacteria. With that 
in mind, we also tested carvacrol on the growing B. burgdorferi 
cells and found its MIC to be 0.16–0.31 µg/ml. This result showed 
that carvacrol is a good drug candidate active against not only 
stationary phase B. burgdorferi but also log phase replicating 
cells. For consideration in clinical applications, there is limited 
safety information on carvacrol and essential oils in humans. In 
mice, carvacrol has been given at 40 mg/kg daily for 20 days with 
no apparent toxicity (33). However, carvacrol and other active 
components of essential oils showed certain cytotoxicity (IC50 
of carvacrol was 200–425 µM) (34, 35) on mammalian cells and 
genotoxic activity in vivo (10 mg/kg) (36). We found that few 
essential oils have been used in human studies. This is probably 
because these essential oils are natural products, which are mix-
tures of multiple active components, and little is known about 
their active ingredients or their mechanisms of antibacterial 
action. Thus, more work is needed to identify their active com-
pounds of the effective essential oils. In addition, it is well known 
that some effective drugs identified in vitro may fail when tested 
in vivo. Thus, adequate animal studies are needed to confirm the 
safety and efficacy of the active essential oils in in vivo setting 
before human studies.
In summary, we found that essential oils had varying degrees 
of activity against stationary phase B. burgdorferi. The most 
active essential oils are oregano, cinnamon bark, and clove bud, 
which seem to have even higher activity than the persister drug 
Dap. A particularly interesting observation is that these highly 
active essential oils had remarkable biofilm-dissolving capabil-
ity and completely eradicated all stationary phase cells with no 
regrowth in vitro. In addition, carvacrol was found to be the 
most active ingredient of oregano with high activity against 
 
B. burgdorferi stationary phase cells. Future studies are needed 
to test whether carvacrol could replace the persister drug Dap in 
drug combinations against more resistant biofilm-like structures 
and for treating persistent Borrelia infections in animal models 
and in patients.
