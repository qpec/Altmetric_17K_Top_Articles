IMPORTANCE Whether the use of sterile vs nonsterile gloves in outpatient cutaneous
procedures affects the rate of postoperative wound infection is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To explore rates of surgical site infection (SSI) with the use of sterile vs nonsterile
gloves in outpatient cutaneous surgical procedures.
DATA SOURCES This systematic review and meta-analysis identified studies from Ovid
MEDLINE (1946 to present), Ovid Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1991 to
present), Ovid EMBASE (1988 to present), EBSCO Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
Health Literature (1980 to present), Scopus (1996 to present), and Web of Science (1975 to
present).
STUDY SELECTION Studies with information on sterile vs nonsterile gloves in outpatient
surgical procedures were retrieved. Only randomized clinical trials and comparative studies
were included for final analysis.
DATA EXTRACTION Data of trial design, surgery characteristics, and outcomes from published
manuscripts and unpublished data were independently extracted.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Randomized clinical trials were considered high quality if
randomization, allocation concealment, blinding, and follow-up completeness were
appropriate. Relative risk and 95% CIs were derived for postoperative wound infections.
RESULTS Fourteen articles met eligibility and inclusion criteria for systematic review; they
included 12 275 unique patients who had undergone 12 275 unique outpatient procedures
with sterile or nonsterile gloves and had follow-up regarding SSI. With the exclusion of 1
single-arm observational study of 1204 patients, 11 071 patients from 13 studies remained in
the meta-analysis. Of these, 228 patients were documented as having postoperative SSI
(2.1%), including 107 of 5031 patients in the nonsterile glove group (2.1%) and 121 of 6040
patients in the sterile glove group (2.0%). Overall relative risk for SSI with nonsterile glove use
was 1.06 (95% CI, 0.81-1.39).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE No difference was found in the rate of postoperative SSI
between outpatient surgical procedures performed with sterile vs nonsterile gloves.

M
any health care specialties provide outpatient cuta-
neous surgical procedures. Gloves were first intro-
duced to surgical practice more than a century ago,
mostlyforhygienepurposes.Afterthat,glovesweremainlyused
forotherreasons,includingthepreventionofhanddermatitis.1
During the past few decades, the use of surgical gloves has be-
come standard practice to prevent postoperative wound infec-
tions or surgical site infection (SSI). However, whether the use
of sterile vs nonsterile gloves makes a difference in the devel-
opmentofpostoperativeSSIsinthesettingofcutaneousandmi-
nor outpatient surgical procedures remains unclear.2,3
Several studies2,4-18 have investigated nonsterile vs sterile
gloves in the setting of Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS), out-
patientdentalprocedures,andlacerationrepair.Studiesofden-
tal procedures4,12,13,15,19-22 have not found a difference be-
tweensterilevsnonsterileglovesinadverseoutcomes,including
SSI. Other studies7,10,11,18 have found that sterile vs nonsterile
glovesdonotmakeadifferenceinSSIinthesettingofMMS,but
1 study6 demonstrated that heightened infection control prac-
tices could decrease the occurrence of SSI from 2.5% to 0.9%.
In another study of 3491 outpatient surgical procedures, those
that were more complex and not considered simple excisions
had an SSI rate of 14.7% with nonsterile gloves compared with
3.4%withsterilegloves(P = .001);nodifferenceinSSIwasnoted
in procedures categorized as simple excisions (1.7% and 1.6%
with nonsterile and sterile gloves, respectively).17
Given the many outpatient minor and cutaneous surgical
proceduresthatoccurworldwide,andgiventhecurrentheight-
ened consciousness about appropriate management of health
careresources,knowingtheeffectofnonsterilevssterilegloves
on postoperative SSI rates would be important.3,7,9,18,23-25 We
performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to exam-
ine this topic.
Methods
This study was performed in accordance with a protocol that
prespecified important criteria such as study selection, exclu-
sion criteria, data extraction, and statistical analysis, as well
as heterogeneity and measurements of inconsistencies. The
methods used in this manuscript were in accordance with the
Cochrane collaboration guidelines (http://www.cochrane
.org), the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for quality assessment (http:
//www.ohri.ca/programs/clinical_epidemiology/oxford.asp),
and the QUOROM statement.26
Search Strategy
ThesearchstrategywasinitiallydesignedintheexpandedOvid
MEDLINE file, which includes in-process and nonindexed ci-
tations from 1946 to the present. Medical subject heading
(MeSH) terms and text words were used to ensure that all rel-
evant citations were included. MeSH terms are a controlled vo-
cabulary used to minimize the number of synonyms necessary
to describe each concept.
MeSHsearchtermsusedforthisstudyincludedgloves,sur-
gical; dermatologic surgical procedures; and surgical infec-
tions. Text words used for this study included: gloves, sterile,
clean,andnonsterile.Weusedpublicationtypesandtextwords
to filter for randomized clinical trials, cohort studies, fol-
low-up studies, or comparative studies. The strategy was then
translated into database-specific terms for the Ovid Coch-
raneCentralRegisterofControlledTrials(1991topresent),Ovid
EMBASE (1988 to present), and EBSCO Cumulative Index to
Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1980 to present). The da-
tabases Scopus (1996 to present) and Web of Science (1975 to
present) were primarily searched with text words.
Study Selection
Studies included in this systematic review and meta-analysis
were randomized clinical trials or prospective or retrospective
observational comparative studies. The patients in the studies
underwent an outpatient cutaneous or mucosal surgical pro-
cedure, including MMS, laceration repair, standard excisions,
and tooth extractions. The procedures used sterile or non-
sterile gloves, and documentation of postoperative SSI was
present. Study eligibility criteria were assessed by 2 indepen-
dent investigators (J.D.B. and A.B.G.J.).
Study Quality Assessment and Risk for Bias
All of the included trials and observational studies were re-
viewed in detail for methodologic features most pertinent to
potentialbias.The2independentreviewers(J.D.B.andA.B.G.J.)
assessedfeaturesaccordingtotheCochranecollaborationguide-
linesfortherandomizedclinicaltrials,whichincludedrandom-
ization, intention-to-treat analysis, completeness of follow-
up, and outcome assessment and attrition rates. Allocation of
concealment, blinding, and masking of allocation were not
evaluated as part of the assessment of quality given that, by the
nature of these studies, all parties could tell whether the gloves
usedfortheprocedureweresterileornonsterile.TheNewcastle-
Ottawa Scale was used to assess the quality of observational
studies. All discrepancies in quality assessment were resolved
by consensus-forming discussions between the 2 investiga-
tors (eTables 1 and 2 in the Supplement).
Data Abstraction and Management
The primary outcome variable in this study was postopera-
tive wound SSI. Data from studies that included other post-
operative complications such as dry socket or inflamed socket
in the setting of dental procedures were not included. Assess-
ment of the primary outcome was performed independently
Key Points
Question What is the difference in rates of surgical site infection
with the use of sterile vs nonsterile gloves during outpatient
cutaneous surgical procedures?
Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis that
included 11 071 patients, no difference was found in the rate of
postoperative surgical site infection between outpatient surgical
procedures performed with sterile vs nonsterile gloves.
Meaning Considering the difference in cost and the increasing
number of minor surgical procedures performed worldwide, use of
nonsterile gloves is an acceptable option.

by the 2 investigators (J.D.B. and A.B.G.J.), and no discrepan-
cies or disagreements existed.
After ensuring that each study included the correct pri-
mary outcome, we abstracted data regarding the use of
sterile vs nonsterile gloves, in addition to the number of pro-
cedures in each arm of the study. Because this comparative
study used dichotomous data measures for the primary out-
come variable, the relative risk (RR) was the unit of analysis.
No missing data were identified in any of the included stud-
ies. All data were abstracted and analyzed using Review
Manager software (version 5.3; Cochrane). In the case of the
studythatincludedonlydatafor1studyarm—nonsterilegloves
only and SSI—data regarding the primary outcome and num-
ber of procedures were abstracted.
Subgroup Analysis and Assessment of Heterogeneity
As a secondary meta-analysis, all studies pertaining to only cu-
taneous surgery (removing all dental procedure studies) and
all studies pertaining to only dental procedures were ana-
lyzed separately. Finally, a subgroup meta-analysis was per-
formed on studies pertaining to only MMS.
Results
Studies Included
A total of 512 publications were initially considered for inclu-
sion after a comprehensive systematic review. From these, 463
weredeemedirrelevantbasedontheabstractandcontent.The
remaining 49 publications were reviewed in full. Of these, 14
met the inclusion criteria (Table, Figure 1, and eTable 3 in the
Supplement).4-7,9-17 Among the 35 articles excluded after full-
text review, 4 articles were in discordance between the 2 in-
dependentreviewers.Consensuswasreachedtoultimatelyex-
clude the 4 articles because of differences in study design and
outcome.3,28-30 One of these studies28 also had no clear evi-
dence of the necessary data needed for inclusion. The au-
thors of the study were contacted, and after multiple failed
attempts, the study was excluded.
Patients
The 14 articles that met the inclusion criteria for systematic
review included a total of 12 275 unique patients who had
undergone 12 275 unique outpatient procedures with sterile
or nonsterile gloves and had follow-up regarding SSI. Inci-
dence of the primary outcome variable for these studies is
shown in eFigure 1 in the Supplement. One study16 included
1204 patients who had undergone MMS with nonsterile
gloves only. Thus, because the study was noncomparative,
these patients could not be included in the meta-analysis. A
total of 11 071 patients were included in the final meta-
analysis, of whom 2741 were randomly assigned to sterile
gloves (n = 1360) or nonsterile gloves (n = 1381) as the inter-
vention in a clinical trial. The remaining 8330 patients were
part of prospective and retrospective observational studies;
these patients had undergone an outpatient cutaneous surgi-
cal procedure with sterile (n = 4680) or nonsterile (n = 3650)
gloves.

Subgroup Analysis and Assessment of Heterogeneity
Low heterogeneity was identified among the studies in-
cluded in the main meta-analysis as an I2 of 0% (P = .43) for
the randomized clinical trials and an I2 of 0% (P = .94) for the
observational studies. Between the 2 different study designs,
the I2 was 0% (P = .43) with an overall I2 of 0% (P = .73). These
statistics suggest that the 2 different study designs were not
heterogeneous and that heterogeneity is not a problem across
theincludedstudiesoverall.Allsubgroupandsensitivityanaly-
ses also had an I2 of 0% except for the subgroup analysis for
cutaneous reconstruction (I2 = 21.9%; P = .26) and the sensi-
tivityanalysisforMartinetal6(excludingLillyandSchmults18),
which had an I2 of 7.9% (P = .30) for heterogeneity among the
different study groups.
Postoperative SSI
Of the 11 071 patients included in the final meta-analysis,
228 were documented as having postoperative SSI (2.1%),
including 107 of 5031 patients in the nonsterile glove
group (2.1%) and 121 of 6040 patients in the sterile glove
group (2.0%). In addition, the single-arm prospective study
with only nonsterile gloves documented 11 of 1204 patients
with a postoperative SSI after MMS (0.9%).16 When we
included these patients in the nonsterile glove cohort, a
total of 118 postoperative SSIs occurred in 6235 total
patients (1.9%).
Data Synthesis
The combined analysis of all studies gave an overall RR of 1.06
(95% CI, 0.81-1.39). The 8 clinical trials had an RR of 0.95 (95%
CI, 0.65-1.40), and the 5 observational studies had an RR of 1.19
(95%CI,0.81-1.73).NoneoftheseRRsweresignificant(Figure2).
Sensitivity Analysis
On contacting the authors of 1 study,6 we were made aware of a
follow-up publication from the same institution.18 To maintain
theassumptionofindependence,insteadofincludingbothstud-
iesseparately,thedatafromthe2studieswerecombined(Mar-
tin et al6 and Lilly and Schmults18) for the final analysis: a total
of1035surgicalproceduresperformedwithnonsterileglovesand
585 with sterile gloves. A sensitivity analysis to determine
whether the outcome was different if either one of the studies
wasexcludedshowednodifference:theRRincludingonlyMar-
tin et al6 was 1.10 (95% CI, 0.84-1.44) and the RR including only
Lilly and Schmults18 was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.78-1.34).
Risk for Bias
Quality assessment was concordant between the 2 reviewers,
withnodiscrepancies.Allstudiesweredeemedtobehighqual-
ity with minimal risk for bias (Table).27 The risk for publica-
tion bias is more of a factor with retrospective observational
studies. Because all studies were believed to be of high qual-

the observational studies, the risk for publication bias was be-
lieved to be minimal.
Additional Analyses
For the subgroup analyses, low heterogeneity was identified
among the included studies in the MMS and dental procedures
cohorts,withanI2of0%forbothandP = .82andP = .70,respec-
tively. For the dental procedures, the overall RR for these stud-
ieswas3.36(95%CI,0.81-13.99)(eFigure2AintheSupplement).
The subgroup analysis for cutaneous reconstruction in the set-
ting of MMS yielded an overall RR of 1.15 (95% CI, 0.68-1.97) for
these studies (eFigure 2B in the Supplement). Finally, studies
in the cutaneous surgery group included 4 randomized clinical
trials and 5 observational studies. The subgroup analysis for
these cutaneous reconstruction studies yielded an overall RR
of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.78-1.34) (eFigure 2C in the Supplement).
Discussion
Our meta-analysis found no difference in the rates of postop-
erative SSIs when comparing sterile vs nonsterile gloves in the
setting of outpatient minor surgery. This finding that simple
cutaneous surgical procedures can be safely performed with
clean,nonsterilegloveswassimilarinseparatesubgroupanaly-
ses of dental procedures, cutaneous surgery, and MMS (grade
of recommendation, 1; strength of evidence, A to B).
This systematic review and meta-analysis provide impor-
tantinsightintoanareaofmedicalpracticethatislargeinscope
and far reaching. Many health care specialties are involved in
outpatient cutaneous minor surgery on a regular basis. Given
the current interest in a more mindful approach to the use of
medical resources and cost containment, understanding
whether the use of sterile vs nonsterile gloves affects SSIs in
outpatient minor surgery is important because of the large cost
difference between these different glove types.7,28
The strengths of this systematic review and meta-analysis
includethepoolingofalargenumberofpatients(n = 11 071)and
the quality of the studies and trials that were pooled, all being
deemed as high-quality research with minimal heterogeneity
andriskforbias.Thus,theevidencefromtheanalysesperformed
as part of this systematic review and meta-analysis would also
be considered of high quality. Subtle differences may have ex-
istedamongthestudiesanalyzedthatwerenotreported,includ-
ing details of surgical site antisepsis measures, draping, use of
topical or systemic antibiotics, or details of hand scrubbing or

Meta-analysis includes findings of studies of surgical site infections with sterile
vs nonsterile gloves after outpatient procedures. RR indicates relative risk. The
size of the diamond represents the 95% CI of the overall assessment. If the
diamond is wide, there is less confidence that it is accurate; however, if the
diamond is narrow and small, then there is a higher confidence that the final
analysis is accurately representing the truth.

washing. However, given the large number of patients summa-
rized and the low heterogeneity found in the included studies,
we do not believe that these possible differences affect the
outcomesofthisrevieworthepoweroftheoverallassessment.
Because several of the studies used for this meta-analysis
wereobservationalstudies,thepossibilityofpublicationbiasre-
mains. This bias seems unlikely, however, given the number of
randomized clinical trials that demonstrate similar results and
the relatively similar outcomes noted across all observational
studies.
Given the thoroughness of the original search strategy and
systematic review, the data in this study would be considered
complete. Some studies that compared sterile vs nonsterile
gloves were excluded because they had a different study de-
signandoutcomemeasure.Oneoftheseexcludedstudiesevalu-
ated the effects on open wounds after surgery3 and another de-
termined the chances of urinary tract infection in the setting of
cystoscopy.29 Although cystoscopy is an outpatient proce-
dure, for the purposes of inclusion, it was not considered simi-
lar enough to an outpatient surgery to meet inclusion criteria.
Specifically, no cutaneous or mucous membrane was cut or
breached as part of the cystoscopy procedure.3,29
We should consider some previous findings that are in dis-
agreement with the findings of our study. In 1 study6 that in-
cluded heightened infection control—multiple sterile precau-
tions, including gloves—the postoperative SSI rates were 2.5%
vs 0.9% in the nonsterile and sterile glove categories, respec-
tively. A follow-up study from this same institution18 demon-
strated that decreasing the costs of infection control protocols,
suchaseliminatingsterileglovesduringthetumorremovalstage
of MMS and removing sterile gowns and half-sheet drapes dur-
ing reconstruction, did not affect infection risk in an office-
based MMS practice. In contrast, in a study separating outpa-
tient surgical procedures by complexity, procedures that were
morecomplexthansimpleexcisionhadapostoperativeSSIrate
of14.7%usingnonsterilegloves,comparedwith3.4%whenster-
ile gloves were used.17 Thus, more extensive surgery or com-
plicated repairs may have a higher risk for SSI, which should be
taken into consideration. This information should be consid-
ered carefully when deciding surgical practice guidelines, be-
cause this systematic review may not be generalizable to more
complex surgical procedures. Of interest, however, some evi-
dence shows that having an open wound for a long duration in
thesettingofacomplexsurgeryorrepairmaynotaffecttherisk
for postoperative SSI as much as once was thought.31 In con-
trast to these disagreements, ample evidence suggests that, in
general, nonsterile gloves do not influence the chances of post-
operative SSI in outpatient surgical procedures.
When considering surgical practices and guidelines, mul-
tiple factors should be considered, including the potential con-

use of nonsterile clean gloves may be justified, caution is ad-

patient surgical procedures that may not pertain to the infor-
mation summarized in this review and meta-analysis. Future
study could include whether duration of surgery and com-
plexity of the repair influence postoperative SSI develop-
ment in the setting of sterile vs nonsterile gloves.
Conclusions
This systematic review and meta-analysis found no differ-
ence in the rates of postoperative SSI in outpatient surgical
procedures performed with nonsterile vs sterile gloves. Given
the cost difference between these gloves and the multitude of
outpatient surgical procedures performed worldwide, these
findings could have a significant effect on and implications for
current practice standards.

NOTABLE NOTES
Kraissl Lines—A Map

An unavoidable and often unsightly complication of elective surgery is
the inevitable scarring that follows.1 Placing elective surgical lines of in-
cisioninfavorablelocationsminimizestheaestheticandfunctionalloss
due to scar contracture. In 1861, anatomist Karl Langer applied the re-
search of Dupuytren to develop a full-body map of elliptical lines ar-
rangedfromsimilaritiesobservedintissuedistortionofcadavers.Langer
concludedthatscarsresultingfrominducedwoundswereshapedbytheir
regionalcollagenorientation.2SwissphysicianEmilKocher,MD,laterrec-
ommended the topographical “Langer lines” as a guideline for surgical
incisions.2Itwassoonrealized,however,thatLangerlinesdeviatedfrom
wound deformation in live patients.
In 1938, American surgeon Herbert Conway, MD, noted widening
in the lower portion of abdominal scars that followed Langer lines and
proposed that skin elasticity in living patient varied from that of
cadavers.2 Columbia University professor of surgery Jerome P. Web-
ster, MD, observed that such discrepancies posed a more favorable
resolution when the incisional direction was along natural skin fold
lines of the living patient.2

andConwayproposedthatskincreasesinlivepatientsrepresentedthe
effect of adaptation to muscle contraction. Because skin itself cannot
shorten, folds are consequently formed perpendicular to the direction
of muscle pull.3 Since scar tissue will follow the skin’
s orientation, fibro-
sisintheplaneofmovementwillroutinelyinterferewithadherentstruc-
tures, setting the stage for subsequent deformity.2

Langer lines serve their greatest instructive value at points coinci-
dent with Kraissl lines.2 Modern teaching now generally recommends
that wrinkle-line incisions be followed. Langer’
s original contributions
may be why the terms “Langer” and “skin” lines are used synonymously
in the lexicon of many medical publications, inadvertently subverting
Kraissl’
s later contributions.
