IMPORTANCE The choice of analgesic to treat acute pain in the emergency department (ED)
lacks a clear evidence base. The combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen (paracetamol)
may represent a viable nonopioid alternative.
OBJECTIVES To compare the efficacy of 4 oral analgesics.
DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial conducted at 2 urban EDs in
the Bronx, New York, that included 416 patients aged 21 to 64 years with moderate to severe
acute extremity pain enrolled from July 2015 to August 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Participants (104 per each combination analgesic group) received 400 mg
of ibuprofen and 1000 mg of acetaminophen; 5 mg of oxycodone and 325 mg of
acetaminophen; 5 mg of hydrocodone and 300 mg of acetaminophen; or 30 mg of codeine
and 300 mg of acetaminophen.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the between-group difference in
decline in pain 2 hours after ingestion. Pain intensity was assessed using an 11-point numerical
rating scale (NRS), in which 0 indicates no pain and 10 indicates the worst possible pain.
The predefined minimum clinically important difference was 1.3 on the NRS. Analysis of
variance was used to test the overall between-group difference at P = .05 and 99.2% CIs
adjusted for multiple pairwise comparisons.
RESULTS Of 416 patients randomized, 411 were analyzed (mean [SD] age, 37 [12] years; 199
[48%] women; 247 [60%] Latino). The baseline mean NRS pain score was 8.7 (SD, 1.3).
At 2 hours, the mean NRS pain score decreased by 4.3 (95% CI, 3.6 to 4.9) in the ibuprofen
and acetaminophen group; by 4.4 (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.0) in the oxycodone and acetaminophen
group; by 3.5 (95% CI, 2.9 to 4.2) in the hydrocodone and acetaminophen group; and by 3.9
(95% CI, 3.2 to 4.5) in the codeine and acetaminophen group (P = .053). The largest
difference in decline in the NRS pain score from baseline to 2 hours was between the
oxycodone and acetaminophen group and the hydrocodone and acetaminophen group (0.9;
99.2% CI, −0.1 to 1.8), which was less than the minimum clinically important difference in NRS
pain score of 1.3. Adverse events were not assessed.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For patients presenting to the ED with acute extremity pain,
there were no statistically significant or clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2
hours among single-dose treatment with ibuprofen and acetaminophen or with 3 different
opioid and acetaminophen combination analgesics. Further research to assess adverse
events and other dosing may be warranted.

 T
he United States is facing an opioid epidemic with al-
most 500 000 individuals dying from drug overdoses
since 2000.1 Despite the epidemic, opioid analgesics re-
main the first-line treatment for moderate to severe acute pain
in the emergency department (ED). Based on data from 2006-
2010, opioids were prescribed for 18.7% of ED discharges.2
Acute extremity injuries are a common painful present-
ing condition seen in emergency practice. Depending on the
degree of discomfort, patients are often treated with a single
dose of an oral analgesic while awaiting further care. There are
many analgesic options, but evidence to inform clinical choice
in this context is sparse.
Relatively few ED studies3-7 have compared the efficacy
of the 3 most commonly used opioid analgesics in the ED
and none has compared them in a single study. Although opi-
oids are considered to provide stronger analgesia than non-
opioid analgesics, 1 ED-based study found that adding combi-
nation oxycodone and acetaminophen to naproxen did not
improve pain relief at 1 week in patients with acute low back
pain.8 Several postsurgical studies have found combination
nonopioids to be as effective as a combination of codeine
and acetaminophen.9-12
Changing prescribing practices is an important step in ad-
dressingtheopioidepidemicanditsadverseeffectsonUScom-
munities, and research suggests that even short-term opioid
use may confer a predisposition to opioid dependence.13,14
The objective of this study was to compare the degree of
pain reduction at 2 hours after ingestion of 4 oral combina-
tion analgesics. One of the analgesics was opioid-free, whereas
the other 3 contained an opioid, and all 4 were combined with
acetaminophen (paracetamol).
Methods
Overview
In this randomized double-blind clinical trial, adult patients
were enrolled during an ED visit for acute extremity pain.
Patients received a single dose of an oral combination analge-
sic (ibuprofen and acetaminophen, oxycodone and acet-
aminophen, hydrocodone and acetaminophen, or codeine
and acetaminophen) and were asked to rate their pain inten-
sity using a verbal numerical rating scale (NRS) from 0 to 10
at 1 and 2 hours following ingestion. The Albert Einstein Col-
lege of Medicine institutional review board provided ethical
oversight and study approval. All participants provided writ-
ten informed consent in either English or Spanish. Data were
collected between July 2015 and August 2016. The protocol
and statistical analysis plan as well as additional post hoc
analyses appear in Supplement 1.
Study Setting
This study was conducted in 2 EDs of the Montefiore Medical
Center. The Moses division is an urban teaching hospital with
more than 100 000 adult visits annually, and is located in the
west Bronx, New York. The Weiler division is a community
hospital with more than 70 000 adult visits annually, and is
located in the east Bronx, New York. Salaried, trained, full-
time, bilingual (English and Spanish) research associates
staffed the ED 24 hours per day, 7 days per week during the
accrual period.
Participant Selection
Patients were considered for inclusion if they were adults aged
21 years through 64 years who presented to the ED for man-
agement of acute extremity pain, which was defined as pain
originating distal to and including the shoulder joint in the up-
per extremities and distal to and including the hip joint in the
lower extremities. Eligible patients were required to have a
clinical indication for radiological imaging (based on judg-
ment of the ED attending physician) that would provide a
built-in delay during which most patients would be able to pro-
vide 1- and 2-hour pain scores. The need for imaging also was
considered to be a proxy for more severe injury, thus increas-
ing the likelihood that an oral opioid analgesic might be an ap-
propriate choice for pain relief in the judgment of the ED at-
tending physician.
Patients were excluded for the following reasons: past use
of methadone; presence of a chronic condition requiring fre-
quent pain management such as sickle cell disease, fibromy-
algia, or any neuropathy; history of an adverse reaction to any
of the study medications; had taken opioids within the past
24 hours; had taken ibuprofen or acetaminophen within the
past 8 hours; pregnant according to either a urine or serum hu-
man chorionic gonadotropin test; breastfeeding (per patient
report); history of peptic ulcer disease; report of any prior use
of recreational narcotics; medical condition that might affect
metabolism of opioid analgesics, acetaminophen, or ibupro-
fen such as hepatitis, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism or
hyperthyroidism, Addison disease, or Cushing disease; pres-
ence of any medicine that might interact with 1 of the study
medications (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or tri-
cyclic antidepressants).
Interventions
After randomization, all patients rated their pain immedi-
ately before taking the study analgesic and again both 1 and 2
hours after taking the medication while remaining in the ED.
Key Points
Question Do any of 4 oral combination analgesics (3 with
different opioids and 1 opioid-free) provide more effective
reduction of moderate to severe acute extremity pain in the
emergency department (ED)?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 411 ED patients with
acute extremity pain (mean score, 8.7 on the 11-point numerical
rating scale), there was no significant difference in pain reduction
at 2 hours. Mean pain scores decreased by 4.3 with ibuprofen and
acetaminophen (paracetamol); 4.4 with oxycodone and
acetaminophen; 3.5 with hydrocodone and acetaminophen; and
3.9 with codeine and acetaminophen.
Meaning For adult ED patients with acute extremity pain, there
were no clinically important differences in pain reduction at 2
hours with ibuprofen and acetaminophen or 3 different opioid and
acetaminophen combination analgesics.

 Patients discharged prior to 2 hours were reached at the 2-hour
time point via a previously confirmed cell phone number. Pa-
tients who required rescue analgesics (based on the discre-
tionoftheEDattendingphysician)receivedanunblinded5-mg
dose of oral oxycodone, which could be administered at any
point during the 2-hour study period. Additional analgesia
could also be administered based on the discretion of the ED
attending physician.
All patients received 3 identical, opaque capsules contain-
ing a total amount of 400 mg of ibuprofen and 1000 mg of ac-
etaminophen; 5 mg of oxycodone and 325 mg of acetamino-
phen; 5 mg of hydrocodone and 300 mg of acetaminophen;
or 30 mg of codeine and 300 mg of acetaminophen. Three cap-
sules were used because the amount of analgesic adminis-
tered was more than would fit into either 1 or 2 blinded cap-
sules small enough for patients to comfortably swallow. All
study analgesics were taken under direct observation to con-
firm ingestion.
Randomization and Blinding
A research pharmacist performed the stratified randomiza-
tion in blocks of 8 using an online randomization plan gen-
erator. The pharmacist masked the analgesics by placing them
into identical unmarked opaque capsules, which were packed
with small amounts of lactose to equalize weight and then
sealed. The pharmacist created research packets, each with 3
tablets containing the masked investigational medication. Re-
search packets were removed by nurses from the Pyxis auto-
mated medical dispensing system located in the ED, and ad-
ministered to the study patients. The randomized allocation
schedule could only be accessed by the research pharmacist,
who had no role in dispensing the medication.
Outcome Measures
Pain intensity was assessed using an 11-point NRS in which a
scoreof0indicatesnopainandascoreof10indicatestheworst
possible pain. The NRS is commonly used in EDs for assess-
inginitialpainattriageandchangesinpainlevelsduringevalu-
ation and treatment. The primary outcome was the between-
group difference in mean change in NRS pain score among
patients receiving 1 of the 4 combination analgesics, mea-
sured from the time before ingestion of the study medication
to 2 hours later. Secondary outcomes included between-
group differences in mean NRS scores at 1 hour and responses
to a 4-point Likert scale rating pain as none, mild, moderate,
or severe. The data collection instrument went through sev-
eral iterations and the Likert scale was not included in the fi-
nal data collection instrument. The minimum clinically im-
portant difference was defined as a mean NRS pain score of 1.3
based on the standard previously derived and independently
validated definition.15-17
Additional outcomes not described in the original proto-
col included the proportion of patients receiving rescue anal-
gesics, the total amount of analgesics in morphine equivalent
units, and an analysis of patients with either documented frac-
tures or a pain score of 10. Demographic characteristics were
collected to describe the population from which the sample
was drawn.
Sample Size Calculation
The following parameters were used to calculate the sample
size: an overall 2-sided significance level of .05 (.008 for all
pairwise comparisons using the Bonferroni correction),18 80%
power, between-group difference for change in mean NRS pain
score of 1.3, and a within-group SD of 2.6 based on estimates
of variability from our prior work.3-5 Using these parameters,
we estimated that 100 patients would be needed per group for
a total of 400 patients.
Analysis
An intention-to-treat analysis was performed. All patients who
were enrolled and met inclusion criteria were analyzed in the
groups to which they were randomized. Those with missing
NRS data (1 per group) had their missing values calculated by
imputation. Details of the imputation analysis appear in
Supplement 2. The primary analysis was a 1-way analysis of
variance testing the null hypothesis that there is no differ-
ence in the effect of the medications on mean change in pain
from baseline to 2 hours with a significance level of .05. The
Bonferroni method was used to adjust the overall signifi-
cance level of .05 to account for multiple comparisons when
all pairwise mean differences in pain were compared, result-
ing in 99.2% CIs.
Four patients were missing 1, 2, or 3 NRS scores (Figure).
Multiple imputation using chained equations was used to keep
these patients in the intention-to-treat analysis. In a post hoc
analysis, NRS scores at 2 hours were imputed for patients
who received rescue medication. This was done to address
bias that could be introduced if receipt of rescue medication
differed by treatment group. If the distributions differ, the
2-hour NRS scores would reflect the combined effect of the ini-
tial and rescue analgesics, thus attenuating differences
between treatment groups. The imputation model included
baseline and 1-hour NRS scores, receipt of rescue analgesia,
language of interview, age, sex, site, ethnicity, treatment
group, diagnosis, and nonpharmacological interventions.
For all analyses, we used SPSS Statistics version 22 (IBM) and
Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp).
Results
During a 13-month period beginning in July 2015, 416 pa-
tients were randomized (Figure). Of these, 5 patients re-
ceived nonopioid analgesia within the past 8 hours (an exclu-
sion criterion) and were inadvertently randomized and later
excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 411, 48% were
female, 60% were Latino, and 31% were black. Baseline char-
acteristics were similar in all groups (Table 1). Baseline pain in-
tensity was initially high (mean NRS pain score, 8.7 [SD, 1.3])
and did not differ between groups (Table 2).
Pain intensity declined over time in all treatment groups
(Table 2). At 2 hours, the mean NRS pain score decreased by
4.3 (95% CI, 3.6 to 4.9) in the ibuprofen and acetaminophen
group; by 4.4 (95% CI, 3.7 to 5.0) in the oxycodone and acet-
aminophen group; by 3.5 (95% CI, 2.9 to 4.2) in the hydroco-
done and acetaminophen group; and by 3.9 (95% CI, 3.2 to 4.5)

 in the codeine and acetaminophen group. The overall test of
the null hypothesis that there is no difference in change in pain
by treatment group from baseline to 2 hours (the primary out-
comemeasure)wasnotstatisticallysignificant(P = .053).There
was also no significant difference at 1 hour (P = .13) (Table 2).
Table 3 shows the comparisons in mean change in pain be-
tween each pair of analgesics. None of the differences be-
tween analgesics was statistically significant or met the a priori
definition of a minimally clinically important difference in
mean NRS pain score of 1.3.
Seventy-three patients (17.8%) received rescue analge-
sics within the 2-hour period (Table 4). The distribution of re-
ceipt of rescue analgesia was not statistically significant, but
the estimates varied by as much as 9% (oxycodone and acet-
aminophen vs codeine and acetaminophen). Results of the
analysis with multiple imputations of the NRS pain scores for

 patients who received rescue analgesics were nearly identi-
cal to the analysis without imputation (eTable 1 and eTable 2
in Supplement 2). There were no clinically important or sta-
tisticallysignificantdifferencesinefficacywhentheseposthoc
analyses were performed.
The amount of rescue analgesia received in morphine
equivalent units was not significantly different across groups
(Table 4). The total amount of opioid was significantly asso-
ciated with treatment group. One patient in the ibuprofen and
acetaminophen group received 6 mg of intravenous mor-
phine and 1 patient in the codeine and acetaminophen group
received 4 mg of intravenous morphine.
We conducted a post hoc subset analysis to assess whether
any analgesic was more effective for severe pain among pa-
tients who either (1) rated their initial pain as a score of 10 on
the NRS or (2) had a documented fracture on radiological
imaging. The results were similar to those from the entire
sample. There were no statistically significant or clinically im-
portant between-group differences (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
AmongpatientspresentingtotheEDwithacuteextremitypain,
none of 4 different combination analgesics, 1 of which was opi-
oid-free, resulted in greater pain relief after 2 hours. The larg-
est difference in decline in mean NRS pain score between any
2 treatments was 0.9 at the 2-hour time point, a difference that

 was not statistically significant and was less than 1.3, which
is a commonly used criterion to define minimal clinically im-
portant difference in pain. The findings support the infer-
ence that there are no clinically meaningful differences be-
tween the analgesic effects of these 4 analgesics and suggest
that a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen repre-
sents an alternative to oral opioid analgesics for the treat-
ment of acute extremity pain in the ED.
Relatively few studies have made direct comparison of
commonly used oral opioid analgesics for the treatment
of acute pain.3-7,19-22 These studies are difficult to compare be-
cause they used varying doses, had different outcomes,
and had methodological limitations, including small sample
sizes and substantial loss to follow-up. However, the results
generally support the inference that opioid analgesics have
similar efficacy.
The combination of nonopioids makes clinical sense be-
cause of the potential to increase analgesic efficacy through
different modes of action.23 However, there are relatively
few studies of the relative efficacy of combination nonopioid
oralanalgesicsvsoralopioids9-12;allwerepostoperativeorden-
tal studies that compared a combination of ibuprofen and ac-
etaminophen vs codeine and acetaminophen. None found any
dose of codeine (30 mg or 60 mg) to be superior to the com-
bination of 400 mg of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in doses
ranging from 325 mg to 1000 mg. One ED-based study com-
pared a combination nonopioid vs oxycodone. All patients re-
ceived ibuprofen and acetaminophen. There were 3 groups
in the study (group 1 received 1000 mg of acetaminophen,
400 mg of ibuprofen, and 200 mg of thiamine; group 2 re-
ceived 1000 mg of acetaminophen, 400 mg of ibuprofen, and
60 mg of codeine; and group 3 received 1000 mg of acetamino-
phen, 400 mg of ibuprofen, and 10 mg of oxycodone). At 30
minutes, there was no difference in analgesic efficacy among
the groups.24 The evidence from these studies suggests
that the lack of greater pain reduction with opioid analgesics
over the combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen found
in the current study may generalize beyond the treatment of
acute extremity pain. In contrast to earlier research, the cur-
rent study offered a direct comparison of the most com-
monly prescribed oral opioids used in the ED and a non-
opioid combination.
The idea that nonopioid analgesics have less analgesic ef-
ficacy and that there are differences between the opioids can
be found in the World Health Organization pain ladder that has
guidedcliniciansinthetreatmentofcancerandnoncancerpain
since 1986.25 Depending on the intensity of pain, nonopioids
(eg, ibuprofen, acetaminophen) are prescribed first, and then,
asnecessary,mildopioids(eg,codeine),followedbystrongopi-
oids (eg, hydrocodone, oxycodone). The findings of the cur-
rent study coupled with the existing literature do not support
these distinctions among the oral analgesics for the treat-
ment of acute extremity pain.
In light of the substantial increase in prescription opioid-
related overdoses and deaths, the widespread use of oral opi-
oids has been questioned.26 Overuse and misuse of opioid an-
algesics in the community is an important contributor to the
opioid epidemic; however, the current study only focused on
treatment in the ED. If a nonopioid combination analgesic pro-
vides comparable pain relief to that obtained by oral opioids
commonly used in the ED, it is possible that physicians may
be more likely to discharge patients and prescribe the same
nonopioid combination analgesics. In addition, patients might
be more accepting of that analgesic so long as it provides ample
painreliefwhenusedintheED.Thischangeinprescribinghabit
could potentially help mitigate the ongoing opioid epidemic
by reducing the number of people initially exposed to opi-
oids and the subsequent risk of addiction, as shown in a re-
cent study13 that found long-term opioid use was signifi-
cantly higher among patients treated by high-intensity ED
opioid prescribers than among patients treated by low-
intensity ED opioid prescribers.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the follow-up time
was limited to 2 hours. Although a more prolonged follow-up
would have provided additional information, the goal was to
determine if a single dose of an analgesic would provide
superior pain relief for patients while in the ED. In addition,
the enrolled patient population included those generally
seen in a fast-track setting, in which patients are discharged
quickly with minimal or no testing. Whether the duration of
analgesia differs among the analgesics is unknown, although
the half-lives are similar and range from approximately 3
hours to 4 hours.
Second, the oral opioids used in this study may be dis-
pensed as 1 or 2 tablets at a time. We chose to administer the
equivalent of 1 tablet. There are no nationally representative
data sets that allow estimation of usual analgesic dose in the
EDsetting.Forexample,theNationalHospitalAmbulatoryCare
Survey2 has medication and route information but not dose
information. The dosage used in this study represents com-
mon practice among physicians from a variety of training pro-
grams and institutions. The dose of opioid chosen also re-
flects prior studies,3-5 which have shown effective pain relief
at the identical dosages used in the current study. In addi-
tion, there was concern that many physicians would not refer
patients for enrollment if it meant administering higher doses
of opioids because most patients were expected to be dis-
charged quickly and the rescue analgesic was predefined to be
5 mg of oxycodone.
Third, approximately 18% of patients received rescue an-
algesia, and this may have driven results toward the null. How-
ever, additional analyses imputing NRS pain score for pa-
tients who received rescue analgesics also showed no clinically
important or statistically significant difference.
Fourth, adverse effect information was not collected. Such
information could influence the choice of analgesic pre-
scribed, especially if one group had significantly more ad-
verse effects than another group. Significant adverse effects
were not expected to occur during the 2-hour follow-up of this
study. However, a similar ED-based study lasting 90 minutes
had an incidence of adverse events of 1.6% in the codeine
group, 3.3% in the nonopioid group, and 16.9% in the oxyco-
done group, with lightheadedness accounting for 70% of ad-
verseeventsintheoxycodonegroup.Inthatstudy,theamount
