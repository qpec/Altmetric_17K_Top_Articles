Abstract
Background: Labrador retrievers are reportedly predisposed to many disorders but accurate prevalence information
relating to the general population are lacking. This study aimed to describe demography, mortality and commonly
recorded diseases in Labrador retrievers under UK veterinary care.
Methods: The VetCompass™ programme collects electronic patient record data on dogs attending UK primary-care
veterinary practices. Demographic analysis covered all33,320 Labrador retrievers in the VetCompass™ database
under veterinary care during 2013 while disorder and mortality data were extracted from a random sample of 2074
(6.2%) of these dogs.
Results: Of the Labrador retrievers with information available, 15,427 (46.4%) were female and 15,252 (53.6%) were
male. Females were more likely to be neutered than males (59.7% versus 54.8%, P < 0.001). The overall mean adult
bodyweight was 33.0 kg (SD 6.1). Adult males were heavier (35.2 kg, SD 5.9 kg) than adult females (30.4 kg, SD 5.
2 kg) (P < 0.001). The median longevity of Labrador retrievers overall was 12.0 years (IQR 9.9–13.8, range 0.0–16.0).
The most common recorded colours were black (44.6%), yellow (27.8%) and liver/chocolate (reported from hereon
as chocolate) (23.8%). The median longevity of non-chocolate coloured dogs (n = 139, 12.1 years, IQR 10.2–13.9,
range 0.0–16.0) was longer than for chocolate coloured animals (n = 34, 10.7 years, IQR 9.0–12.4, range 3.8–15.5)
(P = 0.028).
Of a random sample of 2074 (6.2%) Labrador retrievers under care in 2013 that had full disorder data extracted,
1277 (61.6%) had at least one disorder recorded. The total number of dogs who died at any date during the
study was 176. The most prevalent disorders recorded were otitis externa (n = 215, prevalence 10.4%, 95%
CI: 9.1–11.8), overweight/obesity (183, 8.8%, 95% CI: 7.6–10.1) and degenerative joint disease (115, 5.5%, 95%
CI: 4.6–6.6). Overweight/obesity was not statistically significantly associated with neutering in females (8.3%
of entire versus 12.5% of neutered, P = 0.065) but was associated with neutering in males (4.1% of entire
versus 11.4% of neutered, P < 0.001). The prevalence of otitis externa in black dogs was 12.8%, in yellow
dogs it was 17.0% but, in chocolate dogs, it rose to 23.4% (P < 0.001). Similarly, the prevalence of pyo-traumatic
dermatitis in black dogs was 1.1%, in yellow dogs it was 1.6% but in chocolate dogs it rose to 4.0% (P = 0.011).
Conclusions: The current study assists prioritisation of health issues within Labrador retrievers. The most common
disorders were overweight/obesity, otitis externa and degenerative joint disease. Males were significantly heavier
females. These results can alert prospective owners to potential health issues and inform breed-specific wellness
checks.

 Plain English summary
With origins in the game hunting fields of Canada and
developed in the UK from the 1830s, the Labrador re-
triever is now firmly established as one of the most glo-
bally popular dog breeds and a leading family dog. Indeed,
they were the most commonly registered UK pedigree dog
breed in 2016–2017. The Kennel Club currently registers
three colourings: black, chocolate, or yellow [ranging from
pale yellow (nearly white) to fox red]. Labrador retrievers
are reportedly predisposed to many disorders but accurate
prevalence information relating to the general population
is lacking. This study aimed to describe demography,
mortality and commonly recorded diseases in Labrador
retrievers under UK veterinary care during 2013.
Clinical health records were explored for 33,320 Lab-
rador retrievers in the VetCompass™ database under vet-
erinary care during 2013. Of 33,320 Labrador retrievers
under care in 2013, the females were more likely to be
neutered than males. The most common recorded colours
were black (44.6%), yellow (27.8%) and liver/chocolate
(23.8%). The average adult bodyweight was 33 kg. Males
were significantly heavier than females.
The median life-span of Labrador retrievers overall
was 12 years but was much shorter in chocolate dogs.
The most common causes of death were musculoskeletal
disorders and cancer. More generally, the most common
disorders affecting Labrador retrievers were overweight/
obesity, ear and joint conditions. Skin and ear disease
were significantly more common in chocolate dogs than
in black or yellow dogs.
This report can help breeders and veterinarians priori-
tise strategic approaches to tackle health issues in Labra-
dor retrievers. The results can alert prospective owners to
potential health issues and inform breed-specific wellness
checks.
Background
With origins in the game hunting fields of Canada and
developed in the UK from the 1830s [1], the Labrador
retriever is now firmly established as one of the most
globally popular dog breeds and a leading family dog.
Labrador retrievers are currently very popular in the UK
and were the most commonly registered UK pedigree
dog breed in 2015–2016 [2]. The Kennel Club currently
registers three
colourings: black, liver/chocolate, or
yellow (ranging from pale yellow (nearly white) to fox
red [3]). We were interested in whether these pigmenta-
tions were associated with clinical disorders especially skin
disease since colour is an attribute of the integument.
The median longevity of Labrador retrievers in the UK
has previously been estimated at 12.5 years [4] but there
s a need for additional breed-specific information on the
common causes of death and any sex or coat-colour dif-
ferences in longevity.
Labrador retrievers have reported predispositions to
67 diseases [5]. They are often of stocky build with a
tendency to eat beyond their physiological needs, perhaps
because of a pro-opiomelanocortin gene deletion [6], and
can therefore be prone to obesity [7], a trait that contrib-
utes to clinical manifestations of orthopaedic problems,
notably elbow and hip dysplasia [8]. Descended from dogs
that were selectively bred to help fishermen retrieve
nets and lost lines [9] and then bred to retrieve fallen
water-fowl and other game, the breed is known for
engaging in swimming. This is important because regular
swimming may increase the risk of otitis externa [10] and,
unless the dogs are well-dried, may lead to increased hu-
midity in the hair-coat that may increase the prevalence of
skin disorders.
A study that compared the common disorders recorded
in Labrador retrievers (n = 339) with crossbreds (n = 797)
attending primary veterinary practices in England sug-
gested that Labrador retrievers are relatively predisposed
to various disorders: gastrointestinal disorders (22.7%
versus 18.3% in crossbreds); dermatological disorders
(16.8% versus 11.9%); musculoskeletal disorders (16.2% ver-
sus 14.1%); neoplastic disorders (14.8% versus 9.2%) and
obesity (12.98% versus 3.9% %) [11]. Labrador retrievers
are reported in referral caseloads of veterinary dermatolo-
gists as having a predisposition to otitis externa [12].
Degenerative joint disease (DJD, often also labelled
osteoarthritis), is the most common joint disease recorded
in veterinary practice, and Labrador retrievers are among
the breeds thought to be predisposed [13]. Specifically, by
reducing mobility and therefore inducing decreased exer-
cise and obesity, DJD has considerable potential to com-
promise quality of life [14]. As a degenerative condition,
DJD is linked to accumulated lifetime wear-and-tear and
therefore is often diagnosed in older members of breeds
predisposed to obesity, especially those that have been
neutered [15]. Therefore, exploration of DJD was consid-
ered of particular importance for the current study.
The VetCompass™ programme collects electronic patient
record [EPR] data on dogs attending UK primary-care vet-
erinary practices [16]. Using clinical data from the Vet-
Compass™ programme, this study aimed to characterise
the demography, longevity and common disorders of Lab-
rador retrievers under primary veterinary care in the UK
during 2013. The study was designed to build on the earlier
pilot study of 418 dogs [4]. The results from the current
study could provide a reliable framework to assist re-
forms in breeding practices and ultimately contribute
to improved health and welfare of Labrador retrievers.
The study was also designed to explore sex and colour as-
sociations with longevity and the prevalence of common
disorders. We hypothesised that degenerative joint disease
(DJD) is more prevalent in males than in females. This
was predicted because males are bigger simply by having a

 larger skeleton and may be more predisposed to obesity
[17]. We can use the results of the current study to begin
to unpick these and other contributing influences on DJD.
Methods
Demography
Dogs recorded as Labrador retriever breed were categorised
as Labrador retriever and all remaining dogs were cate-
gorised as non-Labrador retriever. The study population in-
cluded all dogs under primary veterinary care at clinics
participating in the VetCompass™ Programme during 2013.
The VetCompass™ programme collates de-identified EPR
data from collaborating practices [16]. Data fields available
for analysis included a unique animal identifier from each
practice management system provider along with species,
breed, date of birth, sex, neuter status and bodyweight, and
clinical information from free-form text clinical notes,
summary diagnosis terms (VeNom codes [18]) and treat-
ment with relevant dates.
Body weight curves
All available bodyweight data with their associated dates
were extracted from VetCompass™ database for all study
Labrador retrievers (n = 33,320) at any date. The age at
weighing (years) was calculated from the date of birth
and the date of weighing. Individual bodyweight growth
curves were generated for males and females by plotting
age-specific bodyweights and were overlaid with a cross
medians line plot using the Stata mband command.
All-age Bodyweight (Kg) described all available body-
weight and date combinations from the full cohort of
33,320 Labrador retrievers. Adult Bodyweight (Kg) de-
scribed the mean bodyweight recorded from all body
weight measurements of dogs aged over 18 months and
was categorised into 5 groups (< 25 kg, 25.0–29.9 kg,
30.0–34.9 kg, 35.0–39.9 kg, ≥ 40.0 kg). Neuter described
the status of the dog (entire or neutered) at the final
EPR. Age described the age at the final date under veter-
inary care during 2013 (December 31st, 2013) and was
categorised into 5 groups (< 3 years, 3.0 to < 6 years, 6.0
to < 9.0 years, 9.0 to < 12 years, ≥ 12 years).
Longevity and cause-specific mortality
Mortality data (recorded cause, date and method of
death) were extracted on deaths from the available EPR
data of a random sample of 2074 (6.2%) dogs. The date
of death was used to calculate the longevity of the indi-
vidual and the specific cause of death, where discernible,
was categorised using VeNom codes [18].
A prevalence study design derived from the cohort
clinical data of dogs under veterinary care at participat-
ing practices was used to estimate the one-year period
prevalence of the most commonly diagnosed disorders
[19]. Sample size calculations estimated that 1730 dogs
would be needed to represent a disorder with 5.0% ex-
pected prevalence to a precision of 1.0% at a 95% confi-
dence level from a population of 33,320 dogs [20]. In this
study, dogs under veterinary care were defined as those
with at least one EPR; (summary diagnosis term, free-text
clinical note, treatment or bodyweight) recorded either i)
during 2013 and/or ii) both before and after 2013.
Disorder prevalence
Disorder data were extracted on deaths from the avail-
able EPR data of a random sample of 2074 (6.2%) dogs.
One-year (2013) period prevalence values were reported
that described the probability of diagnosis at least once
during 2013. Prevalence estimates were reported overall
and separately by sex and by colour.
The list of unique Labrador retriever animal identifica-
tion numbers was randomly ordered and a subset was
reviewed manually in detail to extract the most definitive
diagnoses recorded for all disorders that existed during
2013 and to manually link this to the most appropriate
VeNom term as previously described [7]. Elective (e.g.
neutering) or prophylactic (e.g. vaccination) clinical events
were not included. No distinction was made between
pre-existing and novel disorder presentations. Disorders
described within the clinical notes using presenting sign
terms (e.g. ‘vomiting’ or ‘vomiting and diarrhoea’), but
without a formal clinical diagnostic term being recorded,
were included using the first sign listed (e.g. vomiting).
The extracted diagnosis terms were mapped to a dual
hierarchy of precision for analysis: fine-level precision
and grouped-level precision as previously described [7].
Briefly, fine-level precision terms described the original
extracted terms at the maximal diagnostic precision re-
corded within the clinical notes (e.g. inflammatory bowel
disease would remain as inflammatory bowel disease).
Grouped-level precision terms mapped the original diagno-
sis terms to a general level of diagnostic precision (e.g. in-
flammatory bowel disease would map to gastro-intestinal).
Statistical analysis
The data were checked for internal validity and cleaned
in Excel (Microsoft Office Excel 2013, Microsoft Corp.).
Internal validity checks assessed for incompatibilities in
extracted data: e.g. a dog that was recorded as having
died but where no date of death had originally been ex-
tracted. For all inconsistencies, the original database was
revisited and corrected data extracted until there were
no internal inconsistencies remained in the analytic
dataset. Cleaning involved standardising the terms used in
the extracted dataset: e.g. the original raw data described
male sex variously as ‘male’ or ‘m’. These synonymous
terms were cleaned to show a single term in the analytic
dataset. Analyses were conducted using Stata Version 13
(Stata Corporation). The sex, neuter status, age and adult

 bodyweight for Labrador retrievers under veterinary care
during 2013 were described. Annual proportional birth
rates described the relative proportion of Labrador re-
trievers compared with all dogs that were born in each
year from 2004 to 2013 from the cohort that were under
veterinary care in 2013.
The 95% confidence intervals (CI) estimates were de-
rived from standard errors based on approximation to the
normal distribution for disorders with ten or more events
[21] or the Wilson approximation method for disorders
with fewer than ten events [22]. The chi-square test was
used to compare categorical variables and the Students
t-test or Mann-Whitney U test to compare continuous
variables as appropriate [21]. Statistical significance was
set at the 5% level.
Results
Demography
The study population of 455,557 dogs from 304 clinics
in the VetCompass™ database under primary veterinary
care during 2013 included 33,320 (7.31%) Labrador re-
trievers. Annual proportional birth rates showed that
Labrador retrievers dropped from 9.6% of the annual
VetCompass™ birth cohort in 2004 to 5.8% in 2013
(Fig. 1). The most common recorded colours were black
(44.6%), yellow (27.8%) and liver/chocolate (23.8%).
Colour was not recorded in some dogs (n = 139). How-
ever, among those for which colour was recorded, the
most common colours were black (44.6%), yellow (27.8%)
and liver/chocolate (23.8%).
Of the Labrador retrievers with information available,
15,427 (46.4%) were female and 15,252 (53.6%) were male.
Females were more likely to be neutered than males
(59.7% versus 54.8%, P < 0.001). Data completeness varied
across the variables assessed: age 99.1%, sex 99.7%, neuter
80.4% and all-age bodyweight 67.0%. The median age of
the Labrador retrievers overall was 4.9 years (IQR 2.3–8.3,
range 0.0–19.8) (Table 1).
Body weight curves
The mean adult bodyweight overall was 33.0 kg (stand-
ard deviation [SD] 6.1). The mean adult bodyweight of
males (35.2 kg, SD 5.9 kg) was higher than for females
(30.4 kg, SD 5.2 kg) (P < 0.001). The median bodyweight
across all ages for males (33.1 kg, IQR: 27.6–38.0, range:
0.9–69.3) was higher than for females was (28.7 kg, IQR:
23.9–33.0, range: 0.7–66.3) (P < 0.001). Bodyweight growth
curves based on 84,750 bodyweight values from 10,228 fe-
males and 103,819 bodyweight values from 12,069 males
showed that Labrador retriever puppies grow rapidly dur-
ing their first year but that males plateau at a higher adult
bodyweight than females (Fig. 2).
Longevity and cause-specific mortality
There were 176 deaths recorded at any time during the
available clinical records. The median longevity of Lab-
rador retrievers overall was 12.0 years (IQR 9.9–13.8,
range 0.0–16.0). Of 176 dogs with sex information available,
the median longevity of females (12.1 years, IQR 9.5–13.8,
range 00.4–16.0, n = 81) did not differ to males (12.0 years,
IQR 10.0–13.8,
range 3.8–15.4, n = 91)
(P = 0.856).
The median longevity of neutered animals (12.5 years,
IQR 10.5–13.9, range 5.5–16.0) was longer than for
entire animals (11.6 years, IQR 8.9–12.4, range 0.0–15.2)
(P = 0.010). There were 29 (16.5%) deaths that did not
have a cause of death stated. Of the remaining 147
deaths, the most common causes of death described
at a grouped-precision level were musculoskeletal disorder
(n = 36, prevalence 24.5%) and neoplasia (31, 21.1%). The
probability of death did not differ between males and

 females for any of the 10 most common causes of mortal-
ity (Table 2). The median age at death from these 10
causes varied from 9.1 years (IQR: 8.2–12.1 years) for heart
disease to 13.4 years (interquartile range: 11.5–14.0 years)
for musculoskeletal disorders (Table 2). The median lon-
gevity of non-chocolate coloured dogs (n = 139, 12.1 years,
IQR 10.2–13.9, range 0.0–16.0) was longer than for choc-
olate coloured animals (n = 34, 10.7 years, IQR 9.0–12.4,
range 3.8–15.5) (P = 0.028).
Disorder prevalence
The EPRs of a random sample of 2074 (6.2%) of Labra-
dor retrievers were manually examined to extract all
recorded disorder data for 2013. There were 1277
(61.6%) Labrador retrievers with at least one disorder re-
corded during 2013 while the remaining 38.4% had no
disorder recorded and either presented for prophylactic
management only or did not present at all during 2013.
The median count of disorders per Labrador retriever
during 2013 was 1 disorder (IQR 0–2, range 0–11) and
did not differ between females (median 1, IQR 0–2,
range 0–11) and males (median 1, IQR 0–2, range 0–7)
(P = 0.796).
The study included 2291 unique disorder events re-
corded during 2013 that encompassed 254 distinct
fine-level disorder terms. The most prevalent fine-level
precision disorders recorded were otitis externa (n = 215,
prevalence 10.4%, 95% CI: 9.1–11.8), overweight/obesity
(183, 8.8%, 95% CI: 7.6–10.1), degenerative joint disease
(115, 5.5%, 95% CI: 4.6–6.6), lameness (91, 4.4%, 05% CI:
3.5–5.4) and periodontal disease (87, 4.2%, 95% CI:
3.4–5.1). Among the 20 most common fine-level pre-
cision disorders, males were more likely than females
to be diagnosed with vomiting (4.6% versus 2.5% re-
spectively,
P = 0.009)
(Table
3).
Overweight/obesity
was not statistically significantly associated with neutering
in females (8.3% of entire versus 12.5% of neutered,
P = 0.065) but was associated with neutering in males
(4.1% of entire versus 11.4% of neutered, P < 0.001).
There some significant associations between on coat colour
associations with ear and skin disease (see Table 5). The
prevalence of otitis externa in black dogs was 12.8%, in
yellow dogs it was 17.0% but, in chocolate dogs, it rose to
23.4% (P < 0.001). Similarly, the prevalence of pyo-traumatic
dermatitis in black dogs was 1.1%, in yellow dogs it was
1.6% but in chocolate dogs it rose to 4.0% (P = 0.011).

 There were 51 distinct grouped-level precision disorder
terms recorded. The most prevalent grouped-level precision
disorders were musculoskeletal (n = 261, prevalence: 12.6%,
95% CI: 11.1–14.1), aural (219, 10.6%, 95% CI: 9.3–12.0),
gastrointestinal (210, 10.1%, 95% CI: 8.9–11.5), dermatological
(202, 9.7%, 95% CI: 8.5–11.1) and overweight/obesity (183,
8.8%, 95% CI: 7.6–10.1). Among the 15 most common
grouped-level precision disorders, females were more likely
than males to be diagnosed with a urinary system disorder
(2.3% versus 0.9% respectively, P = 0.014) (Table 4).
Discussion
The main findings from the current study are that the
most common disorders among Labrador retrievers were
overweight/obesity, otitis externa and degenerative joint
disease. Overweight/obesity was not statistically signifi-
cantly associated with neutering in females but was associ-
ated with neutering in males. This is important not least
because males were significantly heavier.
Demography and mortality
The median longevity of Labrador retrievers in the current
study overall was 12.0 years; this was similar to a previous
estimate, based on a sample of 418 dogs, of 12.5 years [7].
The overall median longevity for dogs of 12.0 years re-
ported here aligns with the historic median estimate of
12.0 years among Labrador retrievers insured in the UK
or attending dog shows [23]. From the current sample, the
median longevity of females did not differ to males, but
the median longevity of neutered animals was longer than
for entire animals. This is in keeping with studies of other
breeds [7].
The current study has shown that annual proportional
birth rates for Labrador retrievers in the UK dropped
from 9.6% of the annual VetCompass™ birth cohort in
2004 to 5.8% in 2013. By definition, this drop represents
an underestimate of early cohorts because 20–25% of
early cohorts are likely to have died before 2013 and
thus are not in the dataset.
The apparent drop in the relative popularity of Labrador
retrievers may reflect an indirect effect of the nascent rise
in popularity of the brachycephalic breeds, such as French
bulldogs, whose registrations rose from third in 2016 to
second in 2017 [2]. The decline of the annual proportional
birth rates for Labrador retrievers in the UK may also
reflect the rise of designer hybrid cross-bred dogs, notably
poodle crosses. Unfortunately, the true scale of the rise in
the popularity of such crosses is difficult to monitor since
litters are not registered. Equally, monitoring the health of
these dogs is hampered by the persistent absence of veri-
fied data on parentage to establish which are first crosses,
second crosses or other [24].
The relationship between coat colour and longevity is
intriguing and has not, to the authors’ knowledge, been
reported in other breeds. The significantly shorter life-
span of chocolate dogs compared with non-chocolate
dogs may reflect differences in lifetime burden of
disease, notably disorders of the integument (see below),
that may create differences in accumulated immune
response.

 In the current study, the most common causes of
death
described
at
a
grouped-precision
level
were
musculoskeletal disorder and neoplasia. Of these two
disorders, neoplasia had more effect on longevity than
musculoskeletal disease, being associated with a median
age at death of 10.6 years versus 13.4 years. Although,
one of the important causes of death was neoplasia,
cancer did not figure as being a disease of major preva-
lence. This serves to highlight that most common
diseases are not terminal and that disease predisposition
in life is not the same as disease predisposition as a
cause of death.
In males, the possible benefits of neutering may in-
clude reducing the risk of later testicular disease, and re-
ducing the risks from androgen-dependent disorders
such as perineal hernias, perineal adenomas, prostatitis
and benign prostatic hyperplasia [25]. In females, neuter-
ing was also reported to reduce the risk of mammary
neoplasia [26], but a recent review stated that the evi-
dence for such an association as only weak [27]. The as-
sociation of neutering to longevity could be more closely
associated to the level of health care provided by con-
scientious owners, but this has yet to be validated in any
external study.
Colour
There some significant associations between on coat colour
associations with ear and skin disease (see Table 5). The
prevalence of otitis externa was significantly higher in choc-
olate dogs than in non- chocolate dogs. Similarly, the preva-
lence of pyo-traumatic dermatitis was more than twice as
high in chocolate dogs than in non- chocolate dogs. We
were interested in the association with coat colour because
chocolate pigmentation is recessive in dogs [28]. So, if choc-
olate coat colour is desired in litters, breeders may be mo-
tivate to breed from certain lines that may inadvertently
increase the ensuing puppies’ predisposition to certain dis-
eases. It is possible that a more restricted population gene
pool has a higher carriage rate of the disease risk genes in-
volved in ear and skin conditions. This finding merits fur-
ther investigation, for example, in the extant VetCompass™
databases for other differentially pigmented breeds such as
pugs and Cavalier King Charles spaniels.
Obesity
The current results for obesity indicate that Labrador
retrievers are at increased risk of being overweight or
obese. If we compare the current results to the results for

 methodology, we can see that the prevalence in Labrador
retrievers of overweight/obese of 8.8% (95% CI: 7.6–10.1)
is less than that reported for pugs (prevalence: 13.18%,
95% CI: 11.12–15.43 [29]) but more than that for Border
terriers (7.01%, 95% CI: 5.69–8.52 [30]) Rottweilers
(7.06%, 95% CI: 6.02–8.21 [31]), German shepherd dogs
(5.18%, 95% CI: 4.16–6.36 [32]) and French bulldogs, for
which overweight/obese did not appear in the top 25 most
common disorders [33]. As with all studies of canine obes-
ity that rely on attending veterinarians’ subjective assess-
ments of bodyweight, the current data rely entirely on
veterinarians recording this information in the text of the
clinical record. Furthermore, we note that the terms obes-
ity and overweight are often used synonymously and that,
especially for breed-specific studies such as the current
one, actual bodyweight is more informative than these
overarching and often overlapping labels.
Excessive bodyweight (overweight and obesity) is very
common in domestic dogs, and linked to various associated
conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and
also to reduced longevity [12]. Weight loss is known to
improve quality of life in dogs [11, 34] reflecting other
benefits such as improved insulin resistance [35] and
reduced lameness [36]. Weight loss can be achieved
through dietary energy restriction [37] along with increased
protein:fat dietary rations, but compliance to the diet must
be maintained [38]. Physical activity should be part of a
weight reduction programme.
Complementary interactions of dog mobility and physical
activity have been shown for both dogs and their owners
[39, 40], and it has been proposed that obese owners may
be more likely to have obese dogs [41–43]. Males plateau at
a higher adult bodyweight than females, and neutered dogs
are more prone to obesity than entire dogs [44, 45]. These
associations may be due to a reduced metabolic rate [46,
47]. The current analysis did not explore the temporality of
whether dogs were neutered before or after being classified
as overweight; a possible avenue for future research on data
from EPR. In the current Labrador retriever sample, only
males were significantly predisposed to obesity when neu-
tered. The question of when, during the maturation of Lab-
rador retrievers, this dimorphism arises warrants deeper
scrutiny. The generalised decline in bodyweight from
10 years onward may reflect an effect of wasting disorders
and flux in the ratio of muscle to bone mass.
Apart from obesity/overweight (discussed above), the
main disorders that merit discussion in the current report
are musculoskeletal, periodontal, enteropathy, aural and
urinary disease. The results relating to these conditions are
explored sequentially below.
Musculoskeletal
The hypothesis that DJD is more prevalent in males than
in females was not supported by the current data. This
finding is consistent with a recent report that focused on
appendicular arthritis [13]. Musculoskeletal disorders,
primarily identified as DJD, lameness and “stiffness” at
the fine diagnostic level, proved to be the most prevalent
group level disorder, with 261 counted among the 2074
in our random cohort of Labrador retrievers (See Table
3). It was also the most common recorded cause of
death, accounting for nearly a quarter of all mortalities.
This finding is consistent with a study of 212 insured
Swedish Labradors in that 29% of mortalities were at-
tributed to non-traumatic and non-neoplastic musculo-
skeletal disorders [48].
DJD accounted for at least 115 of the 261 counted
cases of musculoskeletal disorders (44%) in the current
study and potentially an unknown number of cases charac-
terised as lameness or stiffness at the fine level of diagnostic
precision. In dogs, DJD is usually secondary to a primary
joint problem such as a traumatic injury, a developmental
abnormality or, more rarely, infectious or autoimmune in-
flammation [49–51]. Labrador retrievers are known to be
at risk for common developmental joint disorders including
canine elbow dysplasia [52–54], canine hip dysplasia
[52–55], and humeral head osteochondrosis [53, 56] and
are also prone to cranial cruciate ligament rupture [57].
In these diseases, developmental joint incongruity lead-
ing to abnormal transmission of weight bearing forces
and/or failure of endochondral ossification are believed to
lead to progressive cartilage damage, and subsequent DJD
[58]. Similarly, degenerative joint disease develops pro-
gressively in canine hip dysplasia due to the transmission
of weight-bearing forces though abnormally loose and in-
creasingly dysplastic hip joints [59], and humeral head
osteochondrosis results from failure of endochondral
ossification. While several of these conditions have
sex predispositions reported in the literature in some stud-
ies [53, 54, 57, 60], cases of DJD were not significantly
different by sex in this study.
The current study identified a further 91 cases of lame-
ness and 33 cases of stiffness, in addition to the 115 cases
of DJD. Diagnostic terms such as lameness and stiffness
while non-specific could represent milder or less thor-
oughly investigated cases of DJD or acute/sub-acute pri-
mary injuries which could predispose the dog to secondary
DJD such as an initial presentation of a cranial cruciate
ligament rupture, traumatic injuries and fractures, neuro-
logical conditions and other miscellaneous disorders. We
acknowledge the risk that including some presenting signs
that are not diagnostic may compromise phenotypic
rigour. For example, by regarding “stiffness” as a musculo-
skeletal term, we may risk including some dogs that have
weakness from a systemic disorder, such as pyrexia, rather
than a strictly musculoskeletal disease. Further investiga-
tion could help elucidate the extent to which “lameness”
and “stiffness” are used as a euphemism for DJD.
McGreevy et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2018) 5:8 
Page 9 of 13
 The current results do not suggest more frequent DJD
or obesity in males. We acknowledge that it is difficult
to disambiguate the development of the musculoskeletal
disorders and obesity. It appears that male dogs are less
likely to be diagnosed as obese even when heavier per-
haps, as has been proposed in various breeds of cats be-
cause of having a larger frame [61]. Also some of the
causal factors of DJD have (often inconsistent) sex predis-
positions reported in the literature [52–54], so if males are
more inclined to obesity this might be offset by a lower
tendency to certain diseases which lead to secondary DJD.
Future iterations of this analysis should consider a closer
investigation of the determinants of the patterns of disor-
ders identified in this study.
Periodontal disease
Periodontal disease was a common finding in the current
population of Labrador retrievers. If we compare the
current results for Labrador retrievers to the results for
other VetCompass™ breed studies using the same method-
ology, we can see that the prevalence of periodontal dis-
ease of 4.2% (95% CI: 3.4–5.1) is less than that reported
for pugs (prevalence: 6.14%, 95% CI: 4.74–7.81 [29]) but
much more than that for German shepherd dogs (1.14%,
95% CI: 0.69–1.78 [32]). Given that Labrador retrievers
are mesocephalic, whereas pugs are brachycephalic and
German shepherd dogs tend towards dolichocephalism,
this suggests that cephalic index may have a bearing on
periodontal health [62] and seems to merit further in-
vestigation. That said, periodontal disease had a preva-
lence of 17.63% in (mesocephalic) Border terriers (95%
CI: 15.62–19.79 [30]) does not appear in the list of the 26
most common disorders recorded in French Bulldogs [33].
Gastrointestinal disease
Gastrointestinal disease had an overall prevalence of
10.1% in the current sample (95% CI: 8.9–11.5). It en-
compasses a variety of disorders including pancreatitis,
idiopathic gastroenteritis, dietary indiscretion, intestinal
foreign bodies, infectious gastroenteritis and chronic
conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. There
have been no studies of overall gastrointestinal disease
diagnosed at veterinary practices in dogs, but a telephone
survey of owners did report gastrointestinal disease as one
of the major disease presentation [63]. Conversely, in an-
other study of pedigree dogs visiting first opinion veterin-
ary practices in the UK, gastrointestinal disease was not
one of the most prevalent disorders [7]; additionally, Lab-
rador retrievers have been reported to have a decreased
risk of acute pancreatitis [64]. Potential reasons for Labra-
dor retrievers to have a higher incidence of gastrointes-
tinal disorders includes their anecdotal propensity to
scavenge food [35] and hence potentially a higher
incidence of disease such as gastroenteritis or foreign body
obstruction. Although the level of detail is not adequate
from our analysis to determine the true primary diagnosis
for each case, the large number of clinical records evalu-
ated is likely more reflective of the true incidence in the
general population. The current finding that males are sig-
nificantly more likely than females to present with vomit-
ing merits further scrutiny but there is a need for caution
here since vomiting may be reported as part of a suite of
gastrointestinal disease. It is also interesting that vomiting
was more prevalent than diarrhoea in the current popula-
tion of Labrador retrievers [3.6% (CI: 28–4.5) versus 3.2%
(CI: 2.5–4.5)] whereas the reverse trend was apparent
in German shepherd dogs [29] [2.53% (CI1.83–3.40) ver-
sus 5.24% (CI: 4.22–6.42] using the same methodology
and in Labrador retrievers using a longitudinal cohort
design [65].
Aural and dermatological
Given that both conditions affect the integument, we shall
consider aural and dermatological diseases together. Aural
disease was common among the current population of
Labrador retrievers with a prevalence of 10.6% (95% CI:
9.3–12.0) but was less than that reported for pugs (preva-
lence: 15.06%, 95% CI: 12.91–17.42 [29]), French Bulldogs
(14.0%, 95% CI: 12.6–15.5 [33]) and German shepherd
dogs (11.14%, 95% CI: 9.67–12.76 [329]). Similarly, the
prevalence of dermatological (or cutaneous) diseases in
Labrador retrievers was considerable at 9.7% (95% CI:
8.5–11.1) and more than that reported for Rottweilers
(2.91%, 95% CI: 2.25–3.70 [31]) but again less than that re-
ported for pugs (prevalence: 15.60%, 95% CI: 13.38–17.95
[29]) and for German shepherd dogs (13.98%, 95% CI:
12.34–15.74 [33]). Hair coat length and aural conform-
ation may influence predisposition to these disorders but
most of the disorders are related to atopy. The predispos-
ition of chocolate Labrador retrievers in the current sample
suggests further avenues of immunological research within
the breed.
Labrador retrievers are reported in dermatology referral
caseloads as having a predisposition to otitis [9]. Dermato-
logical problems in our cohort included atopic dermatitis
(that may account for the accompanying prevalence of oti-
tis externa) and pyo-traumatic dermatitis that may reflect
to some extent the breed’s fondness for swimming and
retrieving from water. Otitis externa is one of the most
common problems reported in canine practice [66], as
acute cases manifest with head-shaking that is distressing
for dogs and owners alike, dogs are often presented swiftly
and can be managed with topical polyvalent ear prepara-
tions. A range of organisms can be implicated in cases of
otitis, including Gram-positive cocci, Gram-negative rods
such as Pseudomonas, and the yeast Malassezia pachyder-
matis [67]. However, Nuttall [66] states that in most cases
McGreevy et al. Canine Genetics and Epidemiology  (2018) 5:8 
Page 10 of 13
 bacterial culture and sensitivity testing is not usually per-
formed, and cytology can be helpful in identifying the
most likely causative organisms. However, allergic disease,
notably atopic dermatitis, is the most common primary
trigger for otitis externa [9]. Indeed, a review of referred
cases of otitis in dogs concluded that 75% had atopic
dermatitis as a primary trigger [9]. Acute otitis externa
cases frequently progress into chronic or recurrent disease
that is much harder to resolve, and along with accumu-
lated immunological events, are thought to increases the
risk of aural haematomata [68]. Refractory cases are par-
ticularly problematic in fearful dogs that learn to avoid
having their ears examined and treated by owners.
Urinary disease
Females in the current study were more likely than
males to be diagnosed with a urinary system disorder.
This sex-related difference is unlikely to be peculiar to
Labrador retrievers because it is reported that, apart
from obstructions, urinary disorders are generally more
common in females than males with, for example, urin-
ary tract infections being more than twice as common
[69]. Additionally, urinary incontinence due to urethral
sphincter mechanism incontinence occurs predominantly
in neutered female dogs [70] and has been reported to
occur more frequently in larger-breed animals [71]. Urin-
ary system disorders were recorded as a cause of death in
only 2.7% of Labrador retrievers in the current study and
specific details on the frequency of individual urinary
conditions were not collated as part of the current study.
Study limitations
The findings of this study should be interpreted in light
of some limitations. First, we have considered a random
sample of dogs from the VetCompass™ UK database with
the objective of estimation of prevalence of common disor-
ders, which may underpowered for less common disorders
or causes of mortality. In this study, as a secondary aim,
measures of disease frequency for cause-specific mortality
were quantified from clinical records, which may arguably
not provide an accurate representation of all mortality
events in the population. In a similar vein, we acknowledge
that, although VetCompass™ offers the best resource cur-
rently available for studying the national dog population in
the UK, demography of an entire population, rather than
the veterinary population, may be difficult to infer from
clinical data. The current report includes the results of
multiple testing and therefore strict adherence to a 0.05
p-value cut-off risks Type 1 error of accepting false positive
findings. We suggest that the readers explore the differ-
ences in the reported prevalence or other results to under-
stand the meaning of these values rather than relying on
p-values [72]. Some of the results reported in this study
were based on relatively small sample sizes and therefore
the risks of Type II error (false negative) need to be consid-
ered for these analyses. The focus of the current article was
on disorder prevalence rather than mortality. Future stud-
ies looking more closely at the latter outcomes could be
designed could focus on all dead animals reported in the
database as a starting point (with a record of death) and in-
vestigate the mortality status of those assumed alive by
following up with their owners.
Conclusion
This study of over two thousand Labrador retrievers
provides important disorder information on the general
population of Labrador retrievers. The most common
disorders in Labrador retrievers were otitis externa,
overweight/obesity and degenerative joint disease. Otitis
externa and pyo-traumatic dermatitis were less prevalent
in black dogs yellow dogs than in chocolate dogs. Choc-
olate dogs had a significantly shorter lifespan than
non-chocolate dogs. These results provide a framework to
identify health priorities in Labrador retrievers and can
contribute positively to reforms to improve health and
welfare within the breed.
