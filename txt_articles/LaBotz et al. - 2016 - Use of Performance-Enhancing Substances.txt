abstract
Performance-enhancing substances (PESs) are used commonly by children 
and adolescents in attempts to improve athletic performance. More recent 
data reveal that these same substances often are used for appearance-
related reasons as well. PESs include both legal over-the-counter dietary 
supplements and illicit pharmacologic agents. This report reviews the 
current epidemiology of PES use in the pediatric population, as well as 
information on those PESs in most common use. Concerns regarding use 
of legal PESs include high rates of product contamination, correlation with 
future use of anabolic androgenic steroids, and adverse effects on the focus 
and experience of youth sports participation. The physical maturation and 
endogenous hormone production that occur in adolescence are associated 
with large improvements in strength and athletic performance. For most 
young athletes, PES use does not produce signifi
 cant gains over those seen 
with the onset of puberty and adherence to an appropriate nutrition and 
training program.
CLINICAL REPORT
Guidance for the Clinician in Rendering Pediatric Care
INTRODUCTION
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published position 
papers, a subject review, guidelines, and textbook chapters regarding 
the use of performance-enhancing substances (PESs) by children and 
adolescents.1–3 This clinical report updates and consolidates information 
on this topic. For the purposes of this report, the term “performance-
enhancing substances” will be used to describe the spectrum of dietary 
supplements, as well as legal and illegal drugs that often are used by 
athletes for the purpose of improving athletic performance.
Over the last 2 decades, the availability of PESs has increased with 
access to Internet suppliers, proliferation, and marketing of stimulant-
containing beverages, and increasing use of topically applied anabolic 
androgenic steroids. Although the overall use of many PESs may have 
declined over the past 15 years, reviews of multiple studies have 
prompted concern that the onset of use may be occurring increasingly in 
the pediatric population.4

EPIDEMIOLOGY OF PES USE IN THE 
PEDIATRIC POPULATION
Several national studies have been 
tracking adolescent use of PESs. 
Monitoring the Future (MTF) is an 
annual survey of 50 000 students 
in eighth, 10th, and 12th grade.5 
Figs 1, 2, 3, and 4 outline results 
and trends of PES use as noted 
in MTF. The Youth Risk Behavior 
Surveillance System (YRBSS) is 
a biennial survey that includes a 
representative cross-section of high 
school students in the United States. 
The 2013 YRBSS included surveys 
from more than 13 500 students 
and revealed prevalence rates for 
nonprescribed steroid use that 
were a bit higher than those in MTF, 
with 3.2% reporting lifetime use 
of anabolic androgenic steroids.6 
The reported number was higher 
in boys (4.0%) than in girls (2.2%) 
and indicated a significant decrease 
over the previous 12 years, from a 
high of 5.0% overall use in 2001.
The Partnership Attitude Tracking 
Study (PATS) is an annual survey 
of parents and high school students 
regarding behaviors and attitudes 
about drugs and substance abuse.7 
The 2013 PATS survey included 
responses from more than 3700 
students. Steroid use increased 
slightly from 5% to 7% as compared 
with 2012. However, use of synthetic 
human growth hormone (hGH) 
almost doubled, from 5% to 11%, 
after being fairly stable from 2009–
2012. The report stated that most 
of this increase included teenagers 
who reported a single episode of 
hGH use and that the number of 
teenagers who report having used 
hGH more often has remained 
consistent.
Several studies have demonstrated 
polypharmacy among users 
of PESs, with elevated rates of 
use of both recreational drugs 
and multiple PESs.5, 
8, 
9 MTF has 
demonstrated a strong association 
between use of androstenedione, 
creatine, and anabolic androgenic 
steroids. Approximately 80% of 
androstenedione users and more 
than one-third of steroid users 
also use creatine. Between 2010 
and 2012, approximately half of 
androstenedione users also were 
using anabolic androgenic steroids; 
however, this decreased to 15% in 
2013. Younger creatine users are 
much more likely to be using multiple 
PESs than their older counterparts 
(Table 1).

For many adolescents, use of PESs is 
an attempt to enhance appearance 
rather than performance, and many 
users are not actively involved in 
organized athletic activity. Terms such 
as “performance- and image-enhancing 
substances” and “appearance- and 
performance-enhancing drugs” 
emphasize their broader appeal.10–13 
A Minnesota study evaluating 
various muscle-enhancing behaviors 
revealed that in an urban high school 
population, 38.8% of boys and 18.2% 
of girls reported a history of protein 
supplement use.11 The same study 
revealed rates of use in middle school 
for boys and girls as 29.7% and 24.7%, 
respectively. Although students 
participating in team sports were 
more likely to use protein supplements 
(24.2%), it is worth noting that use of 
protein supplements still was fairly 
high in students who were not involved 
in sports (18.2%).11
Corroborating this higher use of 
PESs in an athletic population, a 
2012 meta-analysis revealed higher 
rates of steroid use in athletes than 
in nonathletes (odds ratio, 1.5).14 In 
addition to sports participation, other 
correlates of PES use include body 
dissatisfaction, 
12 higher BMI, 
11 
training in a commercial gym, 
15 and 
exposure to appearance-focused 
media.13 The latter was particularly 
true for the genre of “fitness” media, 
which tends to have a large focus 
on muscle development, as opposed 
to the genre of more traditional 
sports-reporting media. Multiple 
studies have revealed correlations 
between PES use and alcohol and 
drug use, as well as other risk-taking 
behaviors.15–17
Different patterns of use have been 
identified between boy and girl 
PES users. Girls report much lower 
rates of using substances that are 
generally associated with gains in 
strength and muscle mass, such 
as creatine, androstenedione, and 
anabolic androgenic steroids, and 
these differences grow larger with 
age.5 Conversely, girls report much 
higher rates of using nonprescription 
diet pills. Although this is consistent 
with traditional perceptions of male 
pursuit of muscularity and female 
pursuit of thinness, it is important 
to note that in 2013, 4% of boys 
reported use of diet pills in 2013, 
and 1% to 2% of 12th-grade girls

It is unclear how race and ethnicity 
may correlate with PES use. YRBSS 
data revealed higher rates of steroid 
use in 2013 among Hispanic students 
(4.2%) as compared with students 
who identified themselves as white 
(2.8%) or African American (2.3%).6 
These differences were not noted for 
12th graders in the 2013 MTF data, in 
which steroid use rates within these 
groups were all just under 2.0%.5 
One study revealed increased rates 
of steroid use among Asian students 
(primarily Hmong) as compared 
with white students, with odds ratios 
of 3.51 and 3.37 for boys and girls, 
respectively.11 The PATS revealed 
that hGH use was significantly higher 
in African American and Hispanic 
teenagers as compared with white 
teenagers, with use rates of 15%, 
13%, and 9% respectively.7
REGULATION OF PESs
The most commonly used PESs in 
the adolescent population generally 
are sold over the counter as 
dietary supplements. The Dietary 
Supplement Health and Education 
Act of 1994 (Pub L No. 103-417) 
created supplements as a category 
not subject to US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approval for 
safety or efficacy before coming 
to market. Supplements often are 
intermingled with foods, beverages, 
and over-the-counter medications on 
retail shelves, and it is difficult for the 
consumer to differentiate products 
with ingredients subject to strong 
FDA oversight from products that 
are subject to the looser controls, as 
allowed by the Dietary Supplement 
Health and Education Act.
Given the lack of manufacturing 
oversight, consumers of these 
goods risk using products that are 
contaminated or missing ingredients. 
Several studies that tested protein 
supplements revealed that 8% 
to 20% of these products were 
contaminated with significant 
amounts of heavy metals.18 An 
analysis of supplements obtained 
from US retailers in 2007 revealed 
that 25% of these were contaminated 
with anabolic androgenic steroids, 
and 11% were contaminated with 
stimulants.18 In 2015, the New York 
attorney general sent cease-and-
desist letters to 4 national retailers 
after an investigation revealed that 
only 5 of 20 herbal supplement 
products tested consistently 
contained active ingredients as 
listed.19
Caffeine is unique in that it is 
ingested as a dietary supplement but 
also is contained in many foods that 
are common in the American diet. 
Although the FDA does regulate the 
amount of caffeine in foods (eg, soft 
drinks are allowed a maximum of 71 
mg of caffeine/12 oz), the amount of 
caffeine in energy drinks and other 
dietary supplements is not regulated. 
Additional information on caffeine 
can be found in Fig 3, as well as the 
AAP clinical report “Sports Drinks 
and Energy Drinks for Children and 
Adolescents: Are They Appropriate?” 
which specifically states that energy 
drinks containing stimulants should 
never be consumed by children and 
adolescents.20
The Anabolic Steroid Control Acts 
of 1990 (Pub L No. 101-647) and 
2004 (Pub L No. 108-358) classified 
anabolic androgenic steroids, as 
well as certain precursors that were 
previously marketed as supplements 
(such as androstenedione), as 
Schedule III drugs. The Designer 
Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 
2014 (Pub L No. 113-260) further 
expanded the definition of “anabolic 
steroid” in part to address the 
expansion of synthetic prohormones 
that were developed after passage 
of the 2004 act. These prohormones 
are all now classified as Schedule 
III anabolic steroid drugs, and 
possession or use of any of these 
substances without a physician’s 
prescription is prohibited by state 
and federal laws.
SUMMARY OF PES MECHANISMS AND 
EFFECTS
A vast number of substances are 
purported to have ergogenic (ie, 
performance-enhancing) effects. 
Claims of performance enhancement 
with different drugs and supplements 
are constantly evolving. Initial 
claims of significant performance 
enhancement are often made on the 
Internet as well as in body-building 
and fitness magazines. These claims 
most often are unsubstantiated or 
based on findings from single or 
poorly designed studies. As these 
substances undergo further scrutiny, 
it is common for these initial claims 
to be debunked, and the evidence 
often does not support earlier 
assertions of performance benefit. 
Although it is not possible to provide 
a fully comprehensive list of PESs, 
Table 2 provides an overview of 
substances that are most widely 
known and studied in the pediatric 
population.
Any potential ergogenic effects of 
PESs can be contrasted to the great 
improvements in strength and 
athletic performance often observed 
in child and adolescent athletes 
attributable to the combined effects 
of training and development. Typical 
strength gains of approximately 30% 
are reported in youth resistance 
training programs of 8 to 20 
weeks’ duration.43 Supplements or 
nutritional interventions that are 
currently available and legal cannot 
rival this rate of gain. The best advice 
for performance-related concerns 
in young athletes is to focus on the 
basics of appropriate training and 
nutritional practices as outlined in 
Table 3. PESs are not “shortcuts” to 
higher levels of athletic performance, 
and they cannot compensate for 
athletes who do not adhere to the 
basic principles of good training and 
nutrition.

Creatine
See Fig 1
Creatine is found 
in meat and fi

can degrade some 
creatine in food. 
Generally ~1 g/day 
found in omnivore 
diet. Orally ingested

supplement.
Delays onset of 
muscle fatigue 
during high-
intensity training

most studies is small 
and primarily seen 
in short-duration, 
maximum-intensity 
resistance training.21 
No benefi

Short-term use at usual doses 
appears safe in normal adults, 
but has not been evaluated 
specifi
 cally in the pediatric 
population. Potential concern 
with impact on kidneys because 
of nephrotic metabolites 
(methylamine and formaldehyde), 
and specifi

73% of children consume 
caffeine on any given 
day.25
Caffeine is ubiquitous in 
a variety of food and 
beverages, as well as 
over-the-counter diet 
pills and “stay awake” 
medication.
Currently 
believed that 
performance 
benefi
 t primarily 
due to central 
nervous system 
stimulation 
and enhanced 
muscle 
activation.
Most studies with caffeine 
have examined 3–6 mg/
kg, but 1–3 mg/kg has 
been shown to have 
performance-enhancing 
effects, particularly in 
endurance activity.26
Tolerance. Cardiac arrhythmias 
(premature ventricular 
contractions) increased blood 
pressure. Headaches, irritability, 
sleep disruption, tremor. 
Gastric irritation. Increased 
core temperature with exertion, 
particularly in hot environments. 
Signifi
 cant toxicity has been 
associated with ingestion of 
multiple energy drinks, leading 
to almost 1500 emergency 
department visits in 2011 in the 
12- to 17-y age group.27 Increased 
availability of pure powdered 
caffeine is of particular concern 
and is responsible for at least 
2 deaths in young people (1 
teaspoon of powdered caffeine 
is equivalent to 28 cups of coffee; 
FDA warning).
Median intake of those 
12–19 y who ingest 
caffeine: 40.6 mg.28
Amphetamines often 
are diverted from 
prescription use.
This includes 4% 
improvements in 
strength of knee 
extensors (note: other 
muscle groups did 
not show strength 
improvements with 
caffeine); 14% in 
muscular endurance; 
and 10% to 20% 
improvements in time 
to exhaustion studies.
Nonmedical use of 
amphetamines in 12th 
grade: lifetime: 12.4%; 
monthly: 4.4%.5 Overall, 
athletes not at greater 
risk for use, but boys 
in certain sports with 
higher rates: lacrosse, 
wrestling.29

CONCERNS REGARDING PES USE
The goals of the antidoping 
movement in sports are to protect 
the health of athletes and to prevent 
unfair competition, and use of PESs 
is identified in a survey of adults as 
the most serious issue facing sports 
today.46 Potential health risks are 
outlined for individual substances 
in Table 2. In addition, the “gateway 
hypothesis” of adolescent substance 
abuse may apply with PES use. 
Although causation is difficult to 
prove, initial use of legal ergogenic 
supplements appears to reduce 
barriers to future nontherapeutic use 
of anabolic androgenic steroids by 
increasing social contacts with other 
users of PESs, as well as changing 
perceived social norms and attitudes 
regarding the safety and efficacy of 
illicit PES use.10, 
47, 
48
The moral implications of PES 
use contribute to concerns about 
cheating and unfair competition 
and may have adverse effects on 
the youth sports experience.46 
The top 5 issues of importance 
reported by children and adolescents 
regarding participation in sports 
are, in order: having fun, doing one’s 
best, being with friends, improving 
skills, and being healthy. PES use 
shifts the focus of athletes from the 
pleasure and camaraderie of sports 
participation to that of gaining 
competitive advantage.
DRUG TESTING AND SCREENING
Home
Home drug tests are aggressively 
marketed on the Internet to parents 
with concerns about drug use. In a 
2014 clinical report, the AAP stated it 
does not endorse home drug testing 
because of concerns about lack of 
efficacy, potential misinterpretation 
of test results, and the potential 
negative effect on the parent–child 
relationship.49 The AAP recommends 
that parents’ concerns about drug 
testing be addressed in cooperation 
with health care providers.
Offi
 ce Based
Use of PESs often is clinically 
occult in the pediatric population, 
without reliable changes that can be 
detected on physical examination. 
Bright Futures contains information 
regarding office assessment, as well 
as patient and parent education and 
guidance when substance abuse is 
a concern.50 Suggestions include 
screening for substance use as part of 
an age-appropriate comprehensive 
history and asking open-ended 
questions about substance use at 
home, at school, and by peers before 
progressing to questions about 
personal use.
The Preparticipation Physical 
Evaluation form developed by 
the AAP (https://

regarding use of PESs. Although 
sensitivity of these questions has not 
been studied, the questions provide 
an opportunity for further discussion 
and guidance and are as follows:
Do you drink alcohol or use other 
drugs?
Have you ever taken anabolic 
androgenic steroids or used any 
other performance supplement?
Have you ever taken any 
supplements to help you gain 
or lose weight or improve your 
performance?
The AAP does not endorse 
general drug use screening by 
pediatric health care providers 
but has published guidelines for 
drug testing in the pediatric office 
when there is clinical suspicion of 
use.49
High Schools
Testing in schools often is proposed 
not only to provide a mechanism 
for detecting drug use but also to 
serve as a deterrent. In 1995, the US 
Supreme Court ruled that random 
drug testing of student athletes does 
not violate the Fourth Amendment, 
and in 2002, the Court rendered a 
parallel opinion regarding students 
participating in other extracurricular 
activities.51 Since then, schools in 
a number of states have initiated 
mandatory-random student drug 
testing; however, the efficacy of these 
programs in detecting and preventing 
drug use is unclear. The University 
Interscholastic League in Texas 
runs 1 of the largest high school 
drug testing programs in the United 
States. In 2013–2014, the University 
Interscholastic League conducted 
2633 tests for anabolic androgenic 
steroids with 2 positive results, 7 
protocol violations (ie, student did 
not show up for the test), and 10 
inconclusive results.52 Given the 
prevalence of information available 
on how to avoid positive anabolic-
androgenic steroid (AAS) test results, 
it is impossible to know whether this 
low rate of positive results was a true 
reflection of reduced AAS use in this

population or the result of successful 
efforts at evading detection.
Given the association of AAS use 
with other risk-taking behaviors, 
information concerning the effects 
of these programs on overall rates of 
drug use may be pertinent. The limited 
number of studies evaluating school-
based drug testing reveal mixed results 
regarding deterrent effect on use of 
AAS and other illicit drugs, with 1 study 
documenting increased rates of risk 
factors for future drug use.53, 
54 
Because of concerns regarding poor 
sensitivity, use of limited school 
resources, and potential adverse effects 
on student attitudes and behaviors, 
the AAP does not endorse widespread 
implementation of school-based 
testing.53
College/Elite
Athletes who are participating at 
collegiate, elite, or national levels 
are subject to specific restrictions 
and possible testing for a variety of 
ergogenic aids. Therapeutic use of 
certain medications by the athlete (eg, 
many attention-deficit/hyperactivity 
disorder medications, β2-agonists, 
diuretics) may require physician

TABLE 3  
Training Principles to Enhance Athletic Performance
1. Understand that strength increases actually occur during the recovery periods after working out. Adequate recovery may require up to 48–72 h after a hard 
workout.
 a. Inadequate recovery will impede optimal performance gains.
 b. Low-intensity or cross-training sessions may enhance recovery in between higher-intensity workouts.
2. Training should vary in intensity, duration, and mode to enhance performance adaptations and minimize injury risk.
3. Resistance training can be an effective way to improve strength and power.
 a. The AAP policy statement on strength training in children and adolescents provides a comprehensive overview regarding safety and basic resistance 
training principles in the pediatric population.44
  i. Emphasis on appropriate supervision, technique, and equipment selection reviewed.
 b. Policy statement by the National Strength and Conditioning Association outlines more specifi
 c information on training for specifi
 c performance goals.43
  i. Training for strength: choose a weight that will allow completion of the following with good form and technique:
   1. Novice (<2–3 mo’ experience): 10–15 repetitions for 1 set
   2. Intermediate (3–12 mo’ experience): 8–12 repetitions for 1–2 sets
   3. Advanced (>12 mo’ experience): 6–10 repetitions for 2–3 sets
 c. Greatest gains from a resistance training program will likely be noted after onset of peak height velocity
4. Nutrition.
 a. Adequate carbohydrates
  i. Before exercise to fuel workout and to avoid breakdown of muscle tissue
  ii. Strong evidence that carbohydrate ingestion during exercise sessions lasting longer than 1 h help athletes maintain intensity of effort; however, there is 
emerging evidence that small amounts of carbohydrates may be benefi
 cial during shorter sessions as well.45
  iii. After exercise to build up intramuscular fuel for the next days’ workouts
 b. Adequate hydration to maintain performance level throughout the workout
  i. Ensure adequate hydration before training sessions
  ii. Replenish fl
 uid throughout period of exercise
   1. Unrestricted access to fl
 uid during physical exertion
   2. Young athletes should be encouraged to drink to thirst
   3. Low-carbohydrate solutions (6%–8% carbohydrate) may be benefi
 cial for training sessions longer than 30 min
    a. Sports drinks or nonacidic fruit juice diluted 1:1
   4. Assess fl
 uid losses during exercise with pre- and postworkout weights
    a. Replenish 16–20 oz of fl
 uid for every pound of weight lost
    b. Alter fl
 uid replacement strategy to minimize losses in future workouts
    c. Protein after exercise and interspersed throughout the day to provide a ready pool of amino acids for muscle building throughout the recovery 
period
  i. Athletes consuming a balanced omnivorous diet usually with adequate protein intake
   1. Vegetarian and vegan diets often require additional planning
  ii. Protein requirements of adolescent athletes often range from 1.0 to 1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day
  iii. General rules of thumb for food protein content
   1. 8 g of protein contained in:
    a. 1 oz meat/poultry or 1/2 cup legumes or 1 cup milk/yogurt or 1 cup cooked pasta or 2 tablespoons of almond or peanut butter
    b. Examples of portion sizes:
     i. Cooked meat or poultry: 3 oz is size of computer mouse: ~25 g protein
     ii. 1 cup milk is about the size of a baseball: ~8 g protein
   2. Examples of food-based ways to add protein to diet:
    a. Nonfat dry milk contains 12 g protein per 1/2 cup and can be used to enrich soups/sauces/beverages
    b. Switch from traditional yogurt (7 g protein/6-oz serving) to Greek yogurt (17 g protein/6-oz serving) or cottage cheese (21 g protein/6-oz serving)
    c. Peanuts contain more protein than tree nuts with 26 g protein/100-g serving
     i. Almonds and pistachios with 21 g protein/100-g serving
     ii. Cashews with 18 g protein/100-g serving
     iii. Macadamias with 8 g protein/100-g serving

EDUCATION AND PREVENTION
General
Opinions of and information received 
from family members, school 
professionals, teammates, coaches, and 
health care providers all contribute 
to decision-making about PES use 
in the pediatric population. When 
adolescents are considering using PESs, 
the potential for benefit with PES use 
appears to outweigh dissuasive factors 
significantly.55 Therefore, prevention 
efforts that are directed solely at 
avoidance of adverse consequences of 
PES use (ie, getting caught, cost) are 
likely to be less effective than efforts 
that focus on the lack of realized 
benefit for users of PES.
Educating athletes and families on 
basic training principles for pursuit 
of peak athletic performance may be 
helpful and should be emphasized as 
an alternative to PES use (Table 3). 
USADA provides a comprehensive 
handbook on this topic for parents, 
which can be accessed at http://

School/Sports Team
Information contained in the AAP 
clinical report “The Role of Schools 
in Combating Illicit Substance Abuse” 
also is pertinent regarding PES use; 
however, it does not explicitly address 
the issue of substances that are used 
in pursuit of ergogenic benefit.56 The 
National Institute for Drug Abuse 
provides teaching materials that cover 
use of anabolic androgenic steroids 
and stimulants on its Web site (http://

Alternatives are programs designed 
to address PES use in adolescent 
boys and girls, respectively.57 These 
structured, sport-centered programs 
are led by peers with coach facilitation 
and are considered by the World Anti-
Doping Agency as the most rigorously 
studied and effective way to educate 
adolescents about doping.58 Both of 
these programs were developed at 
Oregon Health and Science University,

ADDITIONAL RESOURCES
For Health Care Professionals
Trends in PES use are subject to 
rapid change, with many substances 
having short-lived reputations as 
ergogenic aids. A combination of 
aggressive Internet marketing efforts 
and the lack of regulatory oversight 
can make it difficult to assess 
reliability of information sources on 
this topic. General information on a 
broad variety of specific substances 
is available in the British Journal 
of Sports Medicine series “A-Z of 
Nutritional Supplements: Dietary 
Supplements, Sports Nutrition Foods 
and Ergogenic Aids for Health and 
Performance (www. 
bjsm. 
bmj. 
com).”
For Parents and Athletes
The USADA Web site (http:// 
www. 
usada. 
org/ 
substances/ 
) contains 
information on specific supplements 
and performance-enhancing 
drugs and information on how to 
assess ergogenic claims and make 
informed decisions regarding dietary 
supplement use.
SUMMARY
1. PES use is common in adolescence, 
and these substances are used in 
attempts to enhance both physical 
performance and appearance.
2. Throughout adolescence, use of 
all PESs tends to increase with age 
e9
 by guest on June 2, 2019
www.aappublications.org/news
Downloaded from 
 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
and is higher in athletes than in 
nonathletes.
3. Boys are at higher risk than girls 
for most PES use. Other risk 
factors for PES use include body 
dissatisfaction, higher BMI, training 
in a commercial gym, exposure to 
appearance-oriented fitness media, 
use of alcohol or drugs, and other 
risk-taking behaviors.
4. PESs most commonly used 
by adolescents are protein 
supplements, creatine, and 
caffeine.
5. Many PESs are sold over the 
counter as dietary supplements. 
Athletes and parents often are 
unaware of the lack of FDA 
oversight of supplements and 
the risk of contamination with 
prohibited substances or absent 
active ingredients in these products.
6. Onset of endogenous hormone 
secretion during puberty, in 
combination with appropriate 
training techniques, is associated 
with large gains in strength and 
overall athletic performance. 
This is particularly true after the 
onset of peak height velocity. For 
most adolescent athletes, PES 
use will not produce significant 
improvements above those 
attained with adherence to 
appropriate nutrition and training 
fundamentals during this time.
7. It can be difficult to keep pace 
with the frequent reports of 
newly recognized PESs. Although 
the majority of initial reports 
of PES benefit are subsequently 
discredited after further study, 
it can be helpful for pediatric 
health care providers to steer 
patients and families to reputable 
Web-based resources for further 
evaluation of PES claims.
8. There is concern that initial use 
of over-the-counter PESs may be 
associated with increased risk 
of future anabolic steroid use 
and other risk-taking behaviors. 
Younger PES users appear to be at 
greater risk of polypharmacy.
