of Health Care

Abstract: Citizens’ social policy opinions are strongly influenced by a simple heuristic: Are the recipients of social benefits
deserving or not? Adding to this growing literature, we provide evidence that the deservingness heuristic does not treat all
social benefits alike. Already at the level of preconscious processing, the heuristic displays a bias toward tagging the recipients
of health care—that is, sick individuals—as deserving. This powerful, implicit effect overrides other opinion factors and
produces broad-based support among the public for health care—across levels of self-interest, media frames, ideological
divides, and national cultures. In contrast, when the deservingness heuristic is utilized for reasoning about unemployment
benefits, implicit psychological constraints are fewer and political conflict erupts depending on differences in interest and
worldviews. Using a variety of methodologies, we track this fundamental difference between the politics of health care and
unemployment benefits from the level of implicit processing to the level of political attitudes.

n the social policy landscape of advanced societies,
health care stands out. Across the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),
an average of 6.2% of the gross domestic product (GDP)
is spent on public health care every year, up from 4.3%
in 1980. Per capita public health expenditure has soared
from an average of US$689 to $1,984 in constant prices,
a 288% increase (OECD 2013). This state of affairs is en-
dorsed by a majority of citizens. People around the world
consistently say that it is the government’s responsibility
to ensure adequate health care for the sick and that more
public spending is necessary to achieve this goal (e.g.,
Coughlin 1980; Jensen 2014; van Oorschot 2006). Even
in the United States, health care enjoys a special position.

Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children’s Health Insurance
Program provide a safety net for the old, the poor, and

(2012) asked if health care is different from other policy
areas. This article provides evidence that health care is
indeed fundamentally special.
Compared to the risks stemming from an individ-
ual’s position in the labor market, above all else job-
lessness, health care protects against the risks that flow
from human biology. These are risks that have always
been with the human species, constituting a threat to
our ancestors across all social strata (Sugiyama 2004;
Sugiyama and Chacon 2000). This stands in contrast to
the risk of unemployment that first emerged as a signifi-
cant risk—and, particularly so, only for the lowest social

strata—during the Industrial Revolution in the 19th cen-
tury (Wilensky and Lebeaux 1958). This article integrates
this observation into research on the psychology of social
policy attitudes. Previous research in this area has demon-
strated the role of the so-called deservingness heuristic:
Citizens support benefits for those they perceive as vic-
tims of uncontrollable events and, hence, deserving of
help, whereas they oppose benefits for those who are to
blame for their own plight (Petersen 2012; Skitka and
Tetlock 1993; van Oorschot 2000).
Drawing on an emerging biological approach to po-
litical psychology (Fowler and Schreiber, 2008; Hibbing,
Smith, and Alford 2013; Hatemi and McDermott, 2011;
Petersen, 2015), we argue that the deep prehistory of
the risk of sickness and injury invites the possibility that
the deservingness heuristic contains content that evolved
specifically to respond to and manage this risk. Due to
the particular nature of health problems over human evo-
lutionary history involving primarily random infections
and injuries rather than modern lifestyle diseases (e.g.,
Sugiyama 2004; Sugiyama and Chacon 2000), we sug-
gest that the deservingness heuristic implicitly tags the
sick and disabled as deserving of help. From this, we pre-
dict that individuals—across levels of self-interest, me-
dia frames, ideological divides, and national cultures—
are psychologically biased toward perceiving the sick as
more deserving than the unemployed. This produces
broad-based, popular support for government spend-
ing on health care. In contrast, when the deservingness
heuristic is utilized for reasoning about the novel risk of
unemployment—where intuitions and biases are fewer—
all of the available cues are utilized to form an impression
onwhetherwelfarerecipientsaredeservingornot.Conse-
quently, on this issue, political conflict erupts depending
on differences in interests and worldviews.
Utilizing insights into the deep history of political
issues adds to the rich literature on issue types. Perhaps
most famously, Carmines and Stimson (1980) distinguish
between “easy” and “hard” issues. Some issues are “easy,”
and, independently of education and knowledge, citizens
can form opinions on such issues. Other issues are “hard”
and require sufficient knowledge of politics to navigate.
Another typology is about how polarized issue opinions
are in the public. Some issues are “valence issues,” and
the public shares opinions on such issues (Stokes 1963).
Other issues are “position issues,” which politically polar-
izethepublic.Inpredictingwhetheraspecificissueishard
or easy, valence or position, most previous research has
taken a clearly top-down perspective and pointed out the
role of political elites (e.g., Carmines and Stimson 1980;
Pollock, Lilie, and Vittes 1993). For example, it is argued
that citizens find issues easy if they have been a central
focus of elite debate and that issue opinions become po-
larized if elite opinions are polarized. Nevertheless, as
already acknowledged by Converse (1964), the sources of
constraint in issue opinions are psychological as well as
social. Following this insight, we offer a bottom-up per-
spective on the nature of political issues. We argue that
politics differ across issues because different issues ac-
tivate different levels of psychological constraint. While
health care and unemployment protection are both easy
issues in the sense that they activate “gut reactions,” they
differ sharply from each other because opinions on the
issue of health care is much more psychologically con-
strained than opinions on unemployment. Consequently,
health care emerges as a valence issue and unemployment
as a position issue.
The Health Care Puzzle
Thehealth careand unemploymentissues shareanumber
of key characteristics. They are both core social policy is-
sues, constitute central areas for all modern welfare states,
address ordinary risks that influence the lives of many cit-
izens, and have been at the top of the political agenda for
decades (Jensen 2014). Moreover, it is well established
empirically that health care and unemployment are quite
similar in terms of their sociodemographic risk profiles
(see Online Appendix I). One World Health Organization
(WHO) study, referring to the experience of the United
Kingdom, concludes that
People further down the social ladder usually run
at least twice the risk of serious illness and pre-
mature death as those near the top. Nor are the
effects confined to the poor: the social gradient
in health runs right across society, so that even
among middle-class office workers, lower rank-
ing staff suffers much more disease and earlier
death than higher ranking staff. (Wilkinson and
Marmot 2003, 10)
This social gradient has been found in all of the modern
societies surveyed, from the economically divided United
States to egalitarian Scandinavia. The materially well-to-
do everywhere tend to be better off in terms of physical
health (e.g., Elo 2009; Mackenbach et al. 2008; Marmot
2005; WHO 2008). The same applies to unemployment.
Here, too, those already marginalized in terms of income
and education suffer much greater risk of finding them-
selves unemployed (e.g., Cusack, Iversen, and Rehm 2006;
OECD 2014, 102–31).
Despite these strong issue similarities, government
spending on health care is uniformly more popular than

government spending on unemployment—even in the
United States, where health care legislation has recently
been the subject of divisive political debates. Figure 1
reports the percentage of respondents thinking that the
government is responsible for ensuring health care and
income maintenance for the jobless. It combines data
from the 2008 European Social Survey (ESS, Panel A)
with data from the 2006 International Social Survey Pro-
gramme (ISSP, Panel B) and covers 105,393 subjects from
41 countries. In each of these surveys, respondents were
asked comparable questions about the responsibility of
the government in relation to health care and the un-
employed (see the supporting information for the exact
wording and coding). The mean support for government
spending on health care is 81.45% in the ESS data and
96.3% in the ISSP data. Across the surveys, the majority
in favor is stunning and dwarfs that of unemployment
protection. The cross-country variation is just as impor-
tant and clearly visible from the graphs. For health care,
the coefficients of variations are 0.09 and 0.03 in Panels
A and B, respectively, whereas they are 0.33 and 0.17 for
unemployment. In other words, around the world, health
care is uniformly more popular than unemployment pro-
tection, which shows much greater variation.
In sum, while there are strong sociodemographic gra-
dients in the need for health care, public support does not
seem to exhibit such gradients. Everywhere around the
world, citizens demand extensive health care. This stands

port at the mass level is much more muted and variable.
Our goal is to understand why health care and unemploy-
ment protection exhibit these diverse patterns.
The Deservingness Heuristic

is randomly distributed across social strata, not noting or
caring that this is not, in fact, the case. In the welfare state
literature, psychological theory has been used to highlight
 DESERVINGNESS AND HEALTH CARE

the importance of such perceptions about the causes of
a welfare recipient’s need for benefits when forming wel-
fareopinions(Petersen2012;Petersenetal.2011;Skitka&
Tetlock 1993; van Oorschot 2000). Multiple studies have
converged on the notion that a psychological heuristic—
the deservingness heuristic—prompts individuals to op-
pose welfare benefits when the need reflects a lack of mo-
tivation (i.e., “laziness”) but support benefits when the
need is caused by random events beyond the individual’s
control (i.e., “bad luck”).
Healthcareandunemploymentbenefitsarebothcore
welfare issues, and, in line with previous research, we
argue that the deservingness heuristic shapes opinions
on both issues (van Oorschot 2000, 2006). At the same
time,however,wearguethatthedeservingnessheuristicis
built to automatically tag sickness-based needs as random
events, whereas this is not the case for unemployment-
based needs. This implies that opinions on health care
and unemployment are constrained differently and give
rise to the observed differences between the valence issue
of health care and the position issue of unemployment.
The Deservingness Heuristic: Past Findings
and Outstanding Questions
Studies show that people across welfare states form wel-
fare opinions using the deservingness heuristic (Fong,
Bowles, and Gintis 2006; Petersen et al. 2012). This uni-
versality has been used to argue that the heuristic likely
reflects an evolved constituent of human nature: specif-
ically, an adaptation for reciprocal social exchange and
an orientation toward investing help in those most likely
to reciprocate (Petersen 2012, 2015). Consistent with this
view, recent empirical work has demonstrated that the
deservingness heuristic engages deep-seated psychologi-
cal processes. It operates (1) automatically (Petersen et al.
2011); (2) through mechanisms of affect, with anger be-
ing activated toward the unmotivated and compassion to-
ward the unfortunate (Brandt 2013; Petersen et al. 2012);
(3) on the basis of the exact same psychological ma-
chinery used to make help-giving decisions in everyday
life (Petersen 2012); and (4) in psychologically powerful
ways such that other relevant considerations (e.g., cul-
tural stereotypes and political values) are down-weighted
once the heuristic is activated (Aarøe and Petersen 2014;
Petersen et al. 2011, 2012).
Past research on the deservingness heuristic has pro-
vided substantial insight into the psychological processes
that are activated after a welfare recipient is categorized as
in or without control, respectively. In contrast, we know
less about the psychological processes that enable citizens
to make the categorization of whether a need is control-
lable or uncontrollable in the first place. More generally,
past research has only to a very limited extent utilized
insights about the deservingness heuristic—or other psy-
chological heuristics—to account for the problem we seek
to address: Why do citizens seemingly agree on levels of
recipient deservingness on one issue (health care) but
not another, structurally similar issue (unemployment)?
Most of the existing research on the deservingness heuris-
tic has focused exclusively on a single type of need (mostly
financial needs) and not provided systematic compar-
isons across need types (though see van Oorschot 2006).
Our argument is not simply that people view sick in-
dividuals as more deserving than the unemployed; rather,
we argue that a feature of the deservingness heuristic is
a built-in bias to tag sickness implicitly as a need that is
randomly caused and, hence, deserving of help. Conse-
quently,acrossstrataandnationalcultures,peoplecannot
be easily swayed in their perceptions of the sick, whereas
this is the case for perceptions of the unemployed. This
generates the substantially different dynamics on the is-
sues of health and unemployment.
An Implicit Bias for Perceiving the Sick
as Deserving
Unemployment—being without a job while otherwise
being fit for and actively seeking one—is a historically
novel risk that is closely tied to the Industrial Revolution
(Wilensky and Lebeaux 1958). Sickness and disability,
in contrast, are age-old risks, and health problems have
most likely been a major cause of lack of access to calo-
ries over human evolutionary history (Sugiyama 2004;
Sugiyama and Chacon 2000; see also Online Appendix II).
Our ancestors evolved as hunters and gatherers, and,
hence, it was necessary to hunt or gather calories (Boyd
and Silk 2000). Sugiyama (2004) interviewed present-day
foragers in the Amazon jungle about their health-related
history. Of the sample, a massive 88% had experienced
injuries that disabled them from foraging for 2 weeks or
more. Similarly, Sugiyama and Chacon (2000) found that,
on average, pathologies prevented Amazonian tribesmen
from participating in 10% of all hunting expeditions and
estimated that just a single hunter being injured results
in a substantial 18% reduction in the average calorie in-
take of the group members (Sugiyama and Chacon 2000,
376–77). Such observations emphasize the evolutionar-
ily recurrent need for health care—both for individuals
who need others to provide calories during periods of
injury and for the collective because the injured hunters
cannot contribute to the common, shared pool of calo-
ries. Indeed, one standard explanation in the evolutionary
sciences for the relatively low mortality of humans is the
 72
CARSTEN JENSEN AND MICHAEL BANG PETERSEN
recurrent availability of care in times of injury and sick-
ness (Gurven et al. 2012; Kaplan et al. 2000).
If humans naturally engage in health care, it requires
a psychology designed to detect health-related problems
and respond with pro-social motivations (Petersen et al.,
2012). In order for evolution to select for such a psy-
chology of care, the standard requirements according
to evolutionary biology are that the need is randomly
dispersed at any given time and that all of the group
members experience the need with sufficient frequency
(Trivers 1971). The evidence suggests that these precondi-
tions were indeed present ancestrally (Kaplan et al. 2000;
Sugiyama 2004; Sugiyama and Chacon 2000). For ex-
ample, among the Amazonian tribes, Sugiyama (2004;
Sugiyama and Chacon 2000) observed that everyone re-
quired care frequently and that accident-related (and,
hence, randomly dispersed) pathologies, such as lacer-
ations, infections, and stings, constituted 78% of the total
number of pathologies.
In modern societies, the causes of health pathologies
are very different from the patterns observed among for-
agers. Heart disease and cancer are now the two leading
causesofdeath,responsibleforamassive47%ofalldeaths
in the United States (Hoyert and Xu 2012). Risk factors for
both diseases are highly nonrandom and, instead, highly
correlated with socioeconomic status, which is largely
due to social patterns in diet and lifestyle (Donaldson
2004). Importantly, dietary patterns (with the exception
of starvation) and lifestyle diseases are novel pathological
threats. The existence of many modern health pathologies
crucially hinges on features that have not existed in the
nomadic hunter/gatherer groups that literally formed the
basis of the existence of our species for millions of years,
including sedentary lifestyles, high population density,
and unrivaled access to fat and glucose (Diamond 2012;
Voeks and Sercombe 2000). As most species-typical fea-
tures of humans evolved under foraging conditions (Boyd
and Silk 2000), this invites the prediction that the human
psychology of health care is designed to reason about the
need for health care in terms of randomly dispersed in-
fections and accidents rather than in terms of modern
lifestyle diseases.
Psychological Constraints and Issue
Dynamics: Health Care versus
Unemployment
When people today hear that an economic need is caused
by sickness, we suggest that it triggers a particular set of
associations constrained by the evolutionary history of
sickness as a risk and the significant role of help giving in
buffering against this risk (Sugiyama 2004; Sugiyama and
Chacon 2000). Given the random nature of evolution-
arily recurrent health problems and the corresponding
need for reciprocal help, we hypothesize the existence of a
species-typical implicit bias toward viewing sick people as
the victims of random events beyond their control and,
hence, deserving of help. In utilizing the term implicit,
we are not arguing that people are unaware that they per-
ceive sick individuals as deserving. Rather, we suggest that
the psychological causes of this perception operate spon-
taneously and outside of awareness, making it feel more
like an objective feature of the world than a self-generated
perception.
This predicted role of implicit psychological con-
straints operating behind the support for government
spending on health care has important political con-
sequences, as suggested by decades of psychological re-
search on explicit versus implicit processes (Greenwald,
Nosek, and Banaji 2003; Haidt 2001). Implicit, intuitive
factors often come to dominate judgments and behaviors
at the expense of explicit, more effortful considerations
related to, for example, ideological consistency and self-
interest (see Haidt 2001; for political applications, see
Lodge and Taber 2013; Petersen et al. 2011). In the con-
text of health care politics, an underlying implicit bias
could make health care support impervious to the kinds
of considerations that form the basis of opinion forma-
tion on other political issues.
From this, we suggest that it is the existence of an im-
plicit, psychological bias that renders the issue of health
care different from the otherwise similar issue of unem-
ployment. We seek to demonstrate this by directly com-
paring the processes behind opinions concerning health
care and unemployment. When people reason about the
novel issue of unemployment, we argue that there are
fewer implicit psychological constraints and that the as-
sociations that come to mind will be less uniform. As a
result of the differences in self-interest and political po-
sition, some people will associate unemployment with
being lazy, but others will associate it with misfortune
(e.g., van Oorschot 2000). Consequently, benefits to the
unemployed will be much more politically contested than
health care for the sick. From these bottom-up psycho-
logical processes, the issue of unemployment emerges as
a contested position issue, whereas the issue of health care
emerges as a valence issue.
Study 1: Evidence for Bias
at the Implicit Level
In testing this theory, we begin at the level of sponta-
neous, implicit intuitions. Specifically, on the basis of
experimental methods from the laboratory, the first study
 DESERVINGNESS AND HEALTH CARE
73
is designed to show that a bias toward perceiving the sick
over the unemployed as victims of uncontrollable events
is traceable directly at the level of implicit processing.
Hence, while previous studies have shown that people
are more supportive of health care than unemployment
benefits (Jensen 2014; van Oorschot 2006), we seek to
test the key novel claim of our theory: that people also
perceive sickness as more uncontrollable than unemploy-
mentand,furthermore,thatthis differenceemerges in the
earliest stages of processing, even before the activation of
conscious control.
Method
Social psychologists have developed laboratory methods
for assessing implicit components of individuals’ beliefs.
The most common method is the implicit association
task (IAT). As described by Greenwald, Nosek, and Ba-
naji (2003, 197), the IAT “provides a measure of strengths
of automatic associations . . . computed from perfor-
mance speeds at . . . tasks in which association strengths
influence performance.” As IATs rely exclusively on com-
parisons of response latencies, it is argued to provide un-
obtrusive measures that to a large extent evade conscious
control.
Study 1 was carried out as a laboratory study and
compared responses on an IAT designed to measure im-
plicit perceptions of unemployed individuals with an IAT
designed to measure implicit perceptions of sick individ-
uals. Thirty-four Danish political science undergraduates
were recruited. Each participant completed, in random-
ized order, two IATs: one about the unemployed and one
about the sick. IATs are “pairing” tasks. In this study, sub-
jects were asked to pair the categories “unemployed” and
“employed” and the categories “sick” and “healthy,” re-
spectively, with words related to being unlucky and lucky,
respectively (for further details on administration and
scoring, see Online Appendix III). If, for example, sub-
jects have a strong implicit association between “sick” and
being unlucky, they should be able to perform this pairing
faster than when asked to pair “healthy” and being un-
lucky. For the IATs used in Study 1, the calculated scores
from the tasks reflect the degree to which the individ-
ual subject implicitly associates being sick and being un-
employed, respectively, with being unlucky (i.e., uncon-
trollable causes). Higher positive scores reflect stronger
associations. Thus, the prediction that people implicitly
equate sickness relative to unemployment with uncon-
trollable causes implies that IAT scores for “sick” versus
“healthy” should be (1) positive and (2) higher than those
for “unemployed” versus “employed.”

and Type of Risk

in each implicit association test as calculated in the Free

Results
Figure 2 shows the mean results for each of the two IATs.
When examining the results from each IAT separately, it
is clear that the mean scores in both tasks are positive
and significantly different from 0 (sick: t(33) = 13.14,
p < .001; unemployed: t(33) = 8.36, p < .001). Sub-
jects tend to associate both being sick and being unem-
ployed (relative to being healthy and being employed)
with uncontrollable causes. In terms of effect size, the
associations with employment status (d = 1.43) are com-
parable to other culturally learned associations assessed
in IATs, such as those relating to political party (d = 1.55),
race (d = 1.00), gender (d = 1.05), and age (d = 1.39;
Greenwald et al., 2003, 210). The associations with health
status, however, are substantially stronger than such cul-
turally learned associations (d = 2.25). Consistent with
this, people are significantly more inclined to equate sick-
ness intuitively and implicitly with being unlucky com-
pared to unemployment (t(33) = 2.17, p = .038). In line
with our theoretical expectations, people are implicitly
inclined to think of the ancestrally recurrent risk of sick-
ness as caused by uncontrollable causes compared to the
modern risk of unemployment.

Study 2: The Implicit Bias Dominates
Explicit Information and Explicit
Self-Interest
The first study provided evidence of a difference in per-
ceptions of “sick” and “unemployed,” that this difference
emerges at early stages of processing, and that it biases
individuals toward perceiving the sick as victims of un-
controllable events, a feature associated with deserving
help. This suggests that the deservingness heuristic im-
plicitly tags sick individuals as victims of uncontrollable
events and, hence, deserving of help.
On this basis, Study 2 investigates how this implicit
bias (1) structures opinions about government aid on
the issue of health care relative to the issue of unem-
ployment and (2) operates in competition against two
types of explicit considerations: considerations related to
self-interest and considerations prompted by the frames
available in political communications. These two factors
constitute major alternative explanations for why citizens
agree or disagree on political issues. If citizens support
health care, it might be because everybody shares a self-
interest in doing so or because everybody has received
communications from political elites that sick individu-
als are deserving (see Pollock, Lilie, and Vittes 1993).
In modern societies, the mass media frequently bring
stories explicitly linking lifestyle (e.g., diet, exercise) and
health problems. Given research on the deservingness
heuristic, information linking individual choice and the
need for government assistance may be expected to re-
duce public support; that jobless individuals are easy to
frame as undeserving has, in fact, already been docu-
mented (Petersen et al. 2011; Slothuus 2007). In contrast
to these findings, we predict that the effects of more ef-
fortful, explicit considerations related to both self-interest
and explicit information about controllability are much
smaller for health care due to the implicit constraints
identified in Study 1.
Psychological studies find that people rely on im-
plicit, intuitive reasoning if it produces a sufficiently clear
basis for decision making (for an overview, see Alter et al.
2007). Only to the extent that sufficiently clear intuitions
are not generated in response to a decision task will peo-
ple begin to engage in more effortful processing (Alter
et al. 2007; Gill, Swann, and Silvera 1998). In the context
of deservingness and welfare opinions, for example, when
clear cues of deservingness are not available, people rely
more on political values (Petersen et al. 2011) and cul-
tural (Aarøe and Petersen 2014) and ideological (Petersen
etal.2012)stereotypes.Whencleardeservingnesscuesare
available, however, the effect of these more cognitively
demanding factors is effectively crowded out. In relation
to the issue of health care, we predict that the informa-
tion that an individual is sick will trigger the intuition
that the individual is deserving because people implic-
itly associate illness with uncontrollable events. In con-
trast, the information that an individual is unemployed
will trigger fewer such intuitions. Consequently, people
should be more confident (Gill, Swann, and Silvera 1998)
and therefore less likely to attend to alternative sources
of considerations—whether related to self-interest or ex-
ternal information—when forming opinions about sick
relative to unemployed individuals. This is the key pre-
diction tested in Study 2.
Method
To investigate the clash between implicit attitude con-
straints and other types of considerations, we recruited
228 Danish university students to participate in an online
experimental study. Subjects were randomly assigned to
one of four experimental conditions organized in a 2 ×
2 factorial design. Following previous experimental stud-
ies on social welfare opinions (Aarøe and Petersen 2014;
Petersen et al. 2012), in each condition, subjects were
asked to “imagine a man,” received information on the
lifestyle of this man, and then were asked to judge whether
“peoplelikehim”deservetobehelpedbythegovernment.
We experimentally varied, first, whether the man was de-
scribed as “long-term unemployed” or “seriously ill” and,
second, whether his lifestyle was described as indolent or
active—that is, key attributes associated with having ver-
sus lacking control over one’s need for public assistance
(van Oorschot 2000). The supporting information pro-
vides the full texts of these vignettes. The descriptions of
the lifestyles were kept constant across the two types of
need (health care versus unemployment benefits), and,
hence, the wordings were carefully chosen to be appli-
cable for both. After reading the vignette, subjects indi-
cated the extent to which they supported that people like
the individual in question received government aid on a
7-point scale ranging from 0 (to a very limited extent) to 6
(to a very large extent). Answers were recoded to vary from
0 to 1, with 1 indicating high support for government aid.
The experimental conditions allow us to investigate
the role of the implicit bias to view sickness as uncontrol-
lable in the face of explicit information to the contrary.
In Study 2, we also wanted to address the role of this
bias in the face of considerations of self-interest. We ob-
tained two additional measures in order to do so, where
we asked about the subjects’ concerns about becoming
seriously ill and long-term unemployment, respectively.
 DESERVINGNESS AND HEALTH CARE
75
Answers were recorded on 4-point scales ranging from
very much to not at all. From these two measures, we cre-
ated a measure of relative concern by subtracting the de-
gree of concern about sickness from the degree of concern
about unemployment and, hence, obtained a measure
ranging from –3 (very much concerned about sickness
and not at all concerned about unemployment) to +3
(not at all concerned about sickness and very much con-
cerned about unemployment). If people are more likely
to help the sick simply because most people think sickness
is the most threatening risk for themselves, we ought to
find the opposite effect for anyone who is more concerned
about unemployment.
Results
Panels A and B in Figure 3 show the mean level of support
across the experimental conditions. As can be seen, sub-
jects support government aid significantly more for both
sick and unemployed recipients when they are framed
as being low in control (i.e., unlucky; p < .001 in both
cases). Importantly, however, at the same time we find
a significant, two-way interaction (F1, 224 = 11.83, p <
.001), such that explicit information about the recipients’
level of control is a massive 200% less influential when
the recipient is framed as sick rather than unemployed.
In essence, even in the face of explicit information that
sick individuals are in control over their fate, subjects
remain overwhelmingly supportive. Furthermore, if the
explicit self-interest argument is correct, there should be
a reversal of the effects documented in Figure 3 among
those who are explicitly more concerned about becom-
ing unemployed than about becoming sick. Yet there is
no evidence that the experimental, two-way interaction is
moderated by explicit concerns (F1, 218 < 0.01, p = .989).
In Online Appendix V, we provide further details on this
analysis.
Study 3: A Second Test of Implicit
Bias versus Explicit Considerations
In line with the argument that the deservingness heuris-
tic implicitly tags sick individuals as deserving, Study 2
showed that people are reluctant to integrate information
to the contrary into opinion formation, even if doing so
might be in their own self-interest. Importantly, com-
paring the effects of explicit information on support for
government aid for the sick and unemployed recipients,
respectively, requires that the information is equally ap-
plicable to the two issues. In Study 2, we used the same
type of explicit information to manipulate perceptions of
deservingness for both sick and unemployed recipients.
Study 3 seeks to replicate the effects in Study 2 but by
using information that is specifically tailored to each of
the two issues, thereby maximizing applicability. In this
way, Study 3 increases the internal validity of our claims.
In addition, we seek to increase their external validity by
utilizing a nationally representative sample.
Method
YouGov, a survey agency, recruited a sample of 1,005
Danes to participate in an online experiment. On the ba-
sis of quota sampling, the samples were selected to be rep-
resentative for the Danish populations on the dimensions
of sex, age, geographical region, and education. The basic
2 × 2 factorial design of the study was exactly the same
as in Study 2, but the vignettes were changed. In all of
the conditions, the subjects were asked to imagine a man
named Simon. In the Unemployed Recipient conditions,
Simon was an unskilled worker who was now unem-
ployed. In the Sick Recipient conditions, Simon was a
long-term smoker who had recently been diagnosed with
lung cancer. In all conditions, Simon had received nu-
merous offers of help by an expert source (his union or
doctor) to take concrete actions that would have reduced
the risk of the aversive event (either more training or
quitting smoking). In the Low Control conditions, Si-
mon accepted the help but still suffered the event. In the
High Control conditions, Simon refused the help and
suffered the event. After reading the vignette, the sub-
jects indicated the extent to which they agreed that the
man deserved government aid on a 7-point scale rang-
ing from 0 (not at all) to 6 (to a very large extent). An-
swers were recoded to vary from 0 to 1, with 1 indi-
cating high support for government aid. As in Study 2,
we also obtained measures of subjects’ concerns about
becoming seriously ill and long-term unemployment,
respectively.
Results
Panels C and D in Figure 3 show the mean level of
support across the experimental conditions. Replicat-
ing the findings from Study 2, subjects support govern-
ment aid significantly more for both the sick and un-
employed recipients when they are framed as being low
in control (i.e., unlucky; p < .001 in both cases). Once
again, however, we also observe a significant, two-way
interaction (F1, 1001 = 5.64, p < .018), such that explicit

information about the recipients’ level of control is sig-
nificantly and substantially (about one-third) less influ-
ential when the recipient is sick rather than unemployed.
Even using extremely well-tailored stimuli, we find that
subjects are reluctant to accept explicit information that
suggests that sick people are undeserving. Furthermore,
we once again find that this effect is unmoderated by ex-
plicit self-interest relating to illness and unemployment

(F1, 894 = 1.34, p = .247). This replication lends strong
confidence to the existence of a bias toward tagging sick
individuals as deserving.
Study 4: Implicit Bias across Cultures
Our theoretical argument implies that the dynamics we
observed in Studies 1, 2, and 3 reflect a species-typical
built-in feature of the deservingness heuristic. Perceiving
sick individuals as victims of uncontrollable events is not
something unique to Danes (the nationality of the sub-
jects in Studies 1, 2, and 3). The first goal of Study 4 was
therefore to provide an externally and cross-culturally
valid replication of the finding that people are biased
toward associating sickness rather than unemployment
with uncontrollable causes.
Method
Study 4 is based on a survey experiment embedded in
three approximately nationally representative surveys.
The surveys were collected in the United States, Denmark,
and Japan. On the basis of quota sampling, the samples
were selected to be representative for the general popula-
tions on the dimensions of sex, age, geographical region,
and education. In each country, we collected data from
more than 500 participants (nUS = 519; nDenmark = 510;
nJapan =528).Theselectionofcountriesisbasedonamost
different systems design: The three countries have widely
diverse welfare state models (Esping-Andersen 1990) and
cultural outlooks (Hofstede 2001; Inglehart and Welzel
2005). In short, Study 4 allows us to test the presumed
universality of the bias identified in Studies 1, 2, and 3.
To test our predictions, we need a measure of the par-
ticipants’ perceptions of whether sickness and unemploy-
ment are controllable. To this end, we designed a unique
survey experiment. Participants were randomly assigned
to one of two conditions. In the first, they were asked to
state their beliefs about “people who are long-term unem-
ployed.” In the second condition, they were asked to state
their beliefs about “people with serious illnesses.” For
both conditions, the participants were asked to express
whether they agreed or disagreed with five statements
that, together, form a scale—the Controllability of Need
scale—which is designed to measure the extent to which
outcomes are perceived to be controllable or uncontrol-
lable. In the two conditions, the questions were exactly
the same and only varied in terms of whether they were
asked with reference to the sick or unemployed. For ex-
ample, respondents were asked about the extent to which
they agreed with the statement, “people are not in con-
trol over whether they become [seriously ill/long-term
unemployed] or not” (see the supporting information
for the full wording of all items). The level of agreement
was stated on a 7-point scale ranging from fully disagree
to fully agree. In each condition, the items were summa-
rized to form reliable scales (sickness: United States: � =
.61; Denmark: � = .75; Japan: � = .65; unemployment:
United States: � = .76; Denmark: � = .82; Japan � = .69).
Results
In a first set of analyses, we seek to provide a cross-cultural
replication of the observation from Study 1 using explicit
observations: that people more readily associate sickness
relative to unemployment with uncontrollable causes.
This can be tested by comparing the mean responses to
the Controllability of Need scales in the two experimental
conditions across the three countries. Figure 4 displays
the results.
The results support the prediction. While there is
cross-cultural variation in the exact mean levels of the
Controllability of Need scales, there is a highly robust
pattern across the countries when the responses to the
two scales are compared. In Denmark, the United States,
and Japan, participants are significantly more inclined
to think of sickness as being brought about by uncon-
trollable causes as compared to unemployment (United
States: t(509) = 4.25, p < .001; Japan: t(521) = 7.98, p <
.001; Denmark: t(500) = 7.01, p < .001). The difference
in mean responses ranges between 7 and 12 percentage
points on the full scale and is highly significant in all of
the countries.1
Study 5: Implicit Bias and the Role
of Political Ideology
Implicit biases, we suggest, are politically important not
just because they push opinions in specific directions but
also because they immunize these opinions from other
influences. In particular, the automatic and subconscious
operations of implicit biases leave less room for other,
more explicit factors to enter opinion formation. The
implicit bias toward viewing sick individuals as deserving
provides citizens with an instantaneous intuition about
what is morally right and wrong on health care. In such
1In Study 4, we also obtained measures relating to the subjects’
explicit concerns about becoming seriously ill and long-term un-
employment, respectively. These are reported in the supporting
information.

cases, it is plausible that citizens would not feel a need
to consider more cognitively demanding factors, such as
their political values or, as documented in Studies 2 and
3, their self-interested concerns. Essentially, we predict
that, on the issue of health care, the implicit bias crowds
out the factors that otherwise fuel political conflict. From
this psychological dynamic, the issue of health care is
predicted to emerge as a valence issue characterized by
shared opinions. Opinion formation on unemployment,
in contrast, is much less cognitively constrained, and,
hence, it is predicted to emerge as a position issue.
In Study 5, focus on a key source of political con-
flict: political ideology. A person’s left–right ideological
position can be seen as the primary summary indicator of

politically relevant individual differences from childhood
socialization over current socioeconomic circumstances
to basic biological differences in physiological sensitivity
and genetics (Hibbing, Smith, and Alford 2013). It has
been argued to be a strong predictor of opinions about
the welfare state specifically (Feldman and Zaller 1992;
Jacoby 1994) and serves as a key input to the deserving-
ness heuristic (Skitka and Tetlock 1993). According to
this line of thinking, the ideology of individuals should
correlate strongly with perceptions and beliefs that ei-
ther justify or de-legitimize government involvement in
all forms of social protection. Conversely, our argument

opens up the possibility that the influence of ideology
is confined to unemployment. The universal nature of
the cognitive constraints on perceptions of the uncon-
trollable nature of health risks could leave little room for
ideological conflict.
Method
Study 5 is conducted on the three-country sample de-
scribed in Study 4. Focus is again on the Controllability of
Need scales described above. To explore how the answers
in each condition were moderated by the political ide-
ology of the participants, after obtaining our dependent
variable, we asked the participants to place themselves on
an 11-point scale designed to measure ideological self-
placement from “left” to “right.”2
Results
In Figure 5, the participants’ scores on the Controllability
of Need scales in each experimental condition are corre-
lated with their ideological positions. The pattern of cor-
relationsacrosscountriesisstriking.Inallthreecountries,

we see that ideology significantly conditions responses in
the unemployment condition but not responses in the
sickness condition. Consistent with this, regression mod-
els with two-way interaction terms between the partici-
pants’ assigned conditions and their ideologies show that
the effects of ideology are significantly different in the
two conditions (United States: F1, 412 = 18.75, p < .001;
Japan: F1, 358 = 4.84, p = .028; Denmark: F1, 451 = 3.98,
p = .047).3
Consistentwithpreviousstudies(e.g.,SkitkaandTet-
lock 1993), we find that perceptions of unemployed wel-
fare recipients depend highly on ideology. Left-wingers
typically view the unemployed as being unlucky victims,
whereas right-wingers view them as lazy. For sickness,
conversely, no effect of ideology is discernible. In line with
our argument, perceptions of the causes of sickness ap-
pear to emerge under the influence of implicit constraints
that outweigh ideological differences and prompt people
to view the sick as unlucky victims deserving of help in-
dependently of their general ideological outlook. Across
three very different cultures and countries, the causes of
sickness are, in other words, outside the confines of ideo-
logical conflict.
3While Study 5 focuses on ideology, another correlate of opinions
about social protection is partisanship. In Online Appendix XIV,
we replicate the findings in Study 5 using measures of partisanship.
 DESERVINGNESS AND HEALTH CARE
81
Conclusion
Health care stands out from many other political issues.
Across countries, ideological divides, differences in issue
framing, and differences in subjective self-interest, peo-
ple support the provision of health care. In the language
of issue typologies, health care is a clear-cut valence is-
sue where support cuts across standard political cleavages
and people from the left and right stand united in their
demand for more and better health care. Unemployment,
in contrast, is a clear-cut position issue. People disagree
on whether unemployment benefits should be increased
or decreased, disagree on whether eligibility should be
tightened or relaxed, and take their position on the ba-
sis of key political differences such as ideological values,
partisanship, or self-interest. In this way, the issue of un-
employment benefits is like many other political issues
such as affirmative action, redistribution, gay marriage,
and abortion. It is health care that stands out.
We have argued that the politics of health care are
unique because of deep-seated psychological constraints
that motivate citizens to view the sick and injured as de-
serving, which, in turn, leads to a belief that it is the gov-
ernment’s responsibility to ensure adequate health care
for everyone. Even if people think that it is much more
likely that they will become unemployed than sick, they
remain more supportive of health care. We have proposed
that a plausible cause of these psychological constraints—
and an explanation for why it is deeply embedded in
human psychology—is (1) the random nature of the in-
fections and accidents that the human species has been
exposed to for millions of years and (2) the pronounced
need for the exchange of help under conditions of infec-
tion or injury in a world in which high-calorie nutrients
must be foraged.
This implicit psychological disposition to support
health care independently of political factors such
as ideology and self-interest should create a forceful
incentive for political elites to increase rather than limit
health care spending. This could explain why public
health care spending in affluent nations has been rising
constantly for decades, as outlined in the introduction—
an expansion occurring in an era in which many other
social
programs
experienced
retrenchment
(Jensen
2014). Traditionally, researchers have explained this
development by noting that health service production
is technologically intensive and that the development of
new, expensive treatments fuels spending increases (e.g.,
Fuchs 1996). However, such a supply-side account cannot
explain why politicians permit spending to drift upward
by adopting all of the new technologies and treatments.
For that, we need a demand-side account, that is, one
that allows us to understand why health care is so popular
that politicians risk serious electoral consequences if they
block expansion. The argument presented in this article
constitutes such a demand-side account.
The psychological constraints operating on health
care attitudes create a forceful obstacle for political elites
seeking to limit health care expenditures. At the same
time, we should emphasize that evolved motivations to
support health care need not always lead to a demand
for government-provided health care. The United States,
for example, has recently experienced intensive debate
about universal health care in the context of the reform
referred to as Obamacare. Studies suggest that part of the
oppositionwasdrivenbyracialresentmentgiventheasso-
ciation between President Obama and the reform (Tesler
2012), but we would suggest that this opposition was
further facilitated by a distinction between health care
coverage and government-funded health care. We expect
people to be primarily concerned about efficient coverage
(i.e., that they and others are covered in times of health
problems) and less about whether this coverage necessar-
ily stems from government funding or private insurance.
While citizens are motivated to support government-
funded health care in general, the U.S. debates suggest
that if elites raise questions about efficiency and pro-
vide alternative policy solutions to the issue of coverage,
then citizens can come to support these alternatives along
partisan lines (see also Feldman and Steenbergen 2001;
Jensen 2014).
Furthermore, it is important to note that not all prob-
lems tackled the by health care system will conform to
people’s evolved intuitions about disease and injury. As a
consequence, some parts of the health care system might
be viewed as less worthy of government funding. During
the data collection for Study 3, we also presented respon-
dents with a list of 20 problems that are often handled by
the health care system. We asked the respondents about
their perceptions of whether each problem was caused
by disease and whether it was the government’s responsi-
bility to help people with this problem. The relationship
between the average answers for these questions for each
of the 20 problems is displayed in Figure 6. Consistent
with our argument, the figure shows an exceptionally
strong relationship between the answers to these ques-
tions: problems that reflect disease are much more likely
to be viewed as problems that the government should
handle (r = .71, p < .001).
Notably, the figure also shows that not all of the prob-
lems that the health care system is handling fit how peo-
ple intuitively understand “disease.” In particular, obesity
and smoking-related health problems (in the survey, we
used a common Danish term for chronic bronchitis that
 82
CARSTEN JENSEN AND MICHAEL BANG PETERSEN
directly links to smoking: smoker’s lungs) are viewed less
as diseases and also less as deserving of help—presumably
because people feel that these problems are under a per-
son’s control to some extent, which clashes with their
intuitive understanding of “disease.” This observation is
important. People do not reason backwards from the fact
that the health care system takes care of a problem to the
notion that this problem is therefore worthy of govern-
ment funding. Rather, people seemingly assume that the
health care system first and foremost deals with needs that
conform to their intuitive notion of disease and, hence,
deserve to be alleviated. In fact, when we asked which
of these problems were most characteristic for the health
care system, 68% said cancer and 12% said cardiac prob-
lems (located in the upper-right corner in Figure 6). No
other problem was viewed as “most characteristic” by
more than a few percent.
These observations suggest that there is room for
politicians to counterbalance upward spending drift if
they engage in careful political communications. Polit-
ical entrepreneurs who want to cut government-funded
health care need to frame health care in a way that empha-
sizes institutional efficiencies and health problems that
conform less to people’s intuitions about disease. In this
way, the psychological constraints operating behind the
political issue of health care are not deterministic for
health care policies. If their origin and structure are well
understood, they can be successfully circumvented.
