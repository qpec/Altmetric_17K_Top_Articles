 There is evidence that patients who are admitted to hospital at the
weekend are at increased risk of dying compared with patients
admitted at other times,1–5 but the reasons for this are unclear.6
In England it has been suggested that the ‘weekend effect’ could
account for 6000 excess deaths per year.7 One explanation relates
to reduced hospital staffing on Saturday and Sunday, and it has
been argued that some deaths could be prevented if patients had
continual access to high-quality care. A ‘7-day National Health
Service’ (NHS) is currently a policy priority in the UK.8 However,
it is likely that the potential for prevention varies from speciality
to speciality and between settings.6 Previous studies have examined
mortality following any admission,3 emergency and elective surgical
admission5 and after stroke,1 but the weekend effect is a relatively
unexplored phenomenon in mental health. A study carried out
in a single London hospital suggested no increase in all-cause
mortality for patients admitted to a psychiatric bed at the weekend.2
Suicide is a key outcome for mental health services,9 and has
previously been used as a marker of the quality and safety of care.10
Some groups of patients, such as current or recent in-patients,11,12
or those receiving intensive treatment at home as an alternative
to admission,13 are at particularly high risk of dying by suicide.
In this study we investigated the timing of suicide in a national
patient sample. Temporal variations in suicide by season of the
year or day of the week have been investigated in a number of
studies previously.14–16 However, our aim in this study was not
to describe the timing of suicide in the general population, but
to examine the specific weekend v. weekday incidence of suicide
in very high-risk patient groups who might be most vulnerable
to changes in service provision. We hypothesised that a weekend
effect would manifest itself as an increased incidence of suicide
on Saturday and Sunday compared with other days of the week.
Another point in the calendar where there may be significant
staffing disruption is the changeover point for junior doctors,17
particularly in August in the UK when many start work for the
first time. We hypothesised that an August effect might result in
a higher incidence of patient suicide in that month compared with
others.
Method
Data acquisition
Suicide data were collected as part of the National Confidential
Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness
(NCISH).18 Data collection has been described in detail elsewhere.19
Briefly, it occurred in three stages. First, national data on people
who had died by suicide in the general population in England
were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Second,
NHS mental health services identified which of these individuals
had been in contact with services in the 12 months before death.
These trusts also identified the clinician who had been caring for
the patient prior to their suicide. Third, detailed questionnaires
were sent to the clinicians to obtain demographic and clinical data
(including care at the time of death). Case ascertainment is relatively
complete with a response rate for questionnaires of over 95%.19
Deaths that received either a suicide or open verdict at
coroner’s inquest were considered to be suicide deaths in the
current study, as is the convention in suicide research in the
UK. Not including open verdict deaths has been shown to
underestimate the number of suicides by up to 50%.20,21 Both
the cases that received a suicide verdict and those that received
an open verdict are collectively referred to as ‘suicides’ in the rest
of this paper.

Background
Patients admitted to hospital at the weekend appear to be at
increased risk of death compared with those admitted at
other times. However, a ‘weekend effect’ has rarely been
explored in mental health and there may also be other
times of year when patients are vulnerable.
Aims
To investigate the timing of suicide in high-risk mental health
patients.
Method
We compared the incidence of suicide at the weekend v.
during the week, and also in August (the month of junior
doctor changeover) v. other months in in-patients, patients
within 3 months of discharge and patients under the care of
crisis resolution home treatment (CRHT) teams (2001–2013).
Results
The incidence of suicide was lower at the weekends for each
group (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.88 (95% CI 0.79–0.99) for
in-patients, IRR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.78–0.92) for post-discharge
patients, IRR = 0.87 (95% CI 0.78–0.97) for CRHT patients).
Patients who died by suicide were also less likely to have
been admitted at weekends than during the week (IRR = 0.52
(95% CI 0.45–0.60)). The incidence of suicide in August was
not significantly different from other months.
Conclusions
We found evidence of a weekend effect for suicide risk
among high-risk mental health patients, but with a 12–15%
lower incidence at weekends. Our study does not support
the claim that safety is compromised at weekends, at least
in mental health services.

 Study sample
The present study included individuals aged 10 years and over
who died by suicide between 2001 and 2013 in England. The
National Confidential Inquiry does not collect data on young
children, where intentions and motivations may be difficult to
establish.19 Previous studies of acute hospital mortality have used
data collected over a single financial year,3 but because of the
comparative rarity of suicide as an outcome we used data collected
over a longer period. Some groups of patients with mental health
disorders are at particularly high risk of suicide. They include
psychiatric
in-patients
and
those
recently
discharged
from
in-patient care,11,12 and those under the care of crisis resolution
home treatment (CRHT) teams (a service intended as an
alternative to admission).13 These groups are in close proximity
to care and may be more affected by weekend changes to staffing
or service availability than other patients. We therefore chose to
focus on them in the current study.
Main outcome
Our main outcome was risk of suicide in relation to day of death.
Previous investigations of the weekend effect in hospital settings
have examined the risk of death by day of admission.3 Suicide
commonly occurs in the context of complex difficulties, but the
final act may be relatively impulsive and in response to an acute
stressor.22 Care at the time of death may therefore be a more
important determinant of outcome than care at the time of
admission. In addition, lengths of stay for in-patient mental health
services are much longer than for acute medical or surgical
specialities,23 and so care immediately following admission may
be less critical in terms of mortality risk.
Statistical analysis
We initially examined the timing of suicide by day of the week. We
expressed the incidence of suicide as the number of suicide deaths
per 100 days at risk (for example, the number of suicide deaths on
a Monday per 100 Mondays at risk throughout the study period or
the number of suicide deaths in January per 100 January days at
risk). Suicide deaths are statistically rare events that can generally
be expected to follow a Poisson distribution. Consequently,
Poisson regression models were fitted with the number of suicides
on each day as the dependent variable. Models were tested for
overdispersion (where variation is high and violates the use of
a Poisson model), and if this was evident, negative binomial
regression models were fitted to account for high variation. The
use of these models allowed the calculation of incidence rate ratios
(IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals, comparing the suicide
incidence at the weekend with the suicide incidence during the
working week. P-values less than 5% were considered significant.
Levels of missing data were low – only two patients in the whole
sample did not have details of the care they had been receiving at
the time of death.
Although our main focus was on risk of suicide in relation to
day of the week, we did also examine the risk of suicide by day of
admission for the in-patient sample only. In order to investigate a
possible August effect we examined the timing of suicide by
month of the year. The ‘August effect’ (or its USA counterpart,
the ‘July effect’) refers to the possible reduction in the quality
and safety of care when final-year medical students become
doctors and junior doctors become a grade more senior.17,24 There
are other potential transition points, but the summer one is the
best described and some of the other changeovers in the UK (for
example every 4 months) are comparatively recent developments
(post 2005).
Results
Over the study period there were 1621 in-patient suicide deaths,
2819 suicide deaths within 3 months of in-patient discharge and
1765 deaths under CRHT teams. Although in-patients were a
distinct group, 592 (21%) of the post-discharge deaths were also
under CRHT. Table 1 shows demographic and clinical characteristics
of the patients.
Figure 1 shows the timing of suicide in relation to day of the
week. There was a significant difference in the incidence of suicide
between weekdays and weekends for all patient groups, with a
lower suicide risk at weekends (in-patients: IRR = 0.88 (95% CI
0.79–0.99); post-discharge patients: IRR = 0.85 (95% CI 0.78–0.92);
patients under CRHT: IRR = 0.87 (95% CI 0.78–0.97)).
Figure 2 shows the timing of suicide in relation to month of
the year. There was no evidence of an August peak in suicide.
The peak month for incidence of suicide was May for in-patients,
September for post-discharge patients and November for CRHT
team patients.

Figure 3 shows the timing of suicide in psychiatric in-patients
in relation to day of admission. Patients who died by suicide were
less likely to have been admitted to hospital on a Saturday or
Sunday than during the week (IRR = 0.52 (95% CI 0.45–0.60),
P50.001). We obtained similar findings when we restricted the
analysis to people who had died within 30 days of admission:
IRR weekend v. weekdays = 0.65 (95% CI 0.54–0.78), P50.001;
or people who had died within 7 days of admission: IRR weekend
v. weekdays = 0.70 (95% CI 0.53–0.94), P= 0.02.
Discussion
Main findings
We found clear evidence of a weekend effect for suicide deaths
among mental health patient groups, but contrary to our
hypothesis, the incidence of suicide was actually 12–15% lower at
the weekend. Similarly, when we re-ran our analysis for in-patients
only based on the day of admission, the incidence of suicide for

 Mental health services, suicide and 7-day working
patients admitted on a Saturday or Sunday was much lower than
for those admitted during the week. We found no evidence for an
August peak in suicide related to the changeover of junior doctors.
Strengths and limitations
Our study involved national data collection with excellent
coverage, but our findings need to be interpreted in the context
of a number of methodological limitations, the most important
of which is the purely descriptive design. We were, of course,
unable to investigate causal mechanisms using this approach.
We did not adjust for potential case mix differences as our
analyses were based on people who had died by suicide rather
than an at-risk cohort. It is therefore possible, although we think
unlikely, that our findings are the result of patients under mental
healthcare at the weekend being at lower risk than patients during
the working week. The reduced IRRs could reflect fewer people
under mental healthcare at the weekend, but in-patients on
weekend leave would be captured in our figures (and in fact the
proportion of in-patients who died while on agreed leave at
weekends and during the week was similar (56% v. 52%,
w2 = 1.69, P= 0.19)). Of course if many more patients were
formally discharged from in-patient wards on a Friday this might
partly account for the findings, but this would not apply to

post-discharge or community patients or our analysis based on
day of admission.
Another potential weakness is that we considered the day of
death as our main outcome rather than the day of the actual
episode of suicidal behaviour. Self-poisoning is one method of
suicide for which there may be a lag between the suicide episode
and death. However, when we ran additional analyses, we found
no significant difference in the temporal pattern of suicide by
different methods (interaction terms for self-poisoning v. other
methods were non-significant). It is also possible that some deaths
were not discovered until after the weekend and so an inaccurate
date of death was recorded on the death certificate. However, this
is unlikely to apply to the in-patients and patients under the care
of home treatment teams (who should have been seen by staff on a
frequent basis) or to post-discharge patients who lived with others
(around half the post-discharge sample).
Interpretation of findings
How might we explain our findings? If reduced medical staffing
does indeed account for the weekend effect in acute medical
and surgical specialities,5,6 it may be that mental health is
relatively protected from this because it is more community
focused, more multidisciplinary in nature and perhaps less reliant
on on-call medical staff out of hours. It could also be that
increased social contact with families and others at weekends helps
prevent some suicide deaths at this time.25 It is also worth noting
that some previous studies that reported an elevated mortality
related to weekend hospital admission actually found a slightly
reduced weekend mortality among people who remained in-patients
that is consistent with our study.26
The much lower incidence of suicide in people admitted at the
weekend in our study is interesting. It could relate to a possible
reduced threshold for admission in the absence of high-quality
weekend cover in community services, which results in ‘lower-risk’
patients being admitted. A recent paper that suggests shorter
admissions for patients admitted to a psychiatric bed at the
weekend is consistent with this.2
Suicide is a complex phenomenon with a variety of causes, and
another explanation for our findings could be that wider societal
and environmental factors are more important determinants of
suicide than mental health service provision. However, aspects
of psychiatric services can be related to suicide,10 and we have
previously shown an association between staffing turnover and
suicide rates in UK mental health services.27 The patients included
in this study had high levels of morbidity and need – the majority
had significant psychiatric illness and a history of previous suicidal
behaviour, and almost half had a history of alcohol or drug misuse.
They died in close proximity to care, and we focused on them in
the current study because they might be expected to be the groups
most vulnerable to changes in care and supervision. We think it is
unlikely that the drivers of temporal variation in suicide in these
complex clinical groups are identical to the drivers in the general
population. Nonetheless, it is possible that any service-related
changes in this study were masked by the more general temporal
variations in suicide. Previous general population and clinical
studies have also found peaks in suicide at the beginning of the
working week and in spring.28–32 However, when we ran a post
hoc analysis based on all suicide deaths in the general population
in England (2001–2013) we found that the weekend v. weekday
difference was actually slightly smaller than the one we found
in the clinical groups – incidence of suicide around 8% lower at
the weekend in the general population v. 12–15% lower at
the weekend in the patient groups (although these differences
were not statistically significant when examined using tests of
interaction, P-values ranging from 0.18 to 0.56).
Seven-day working for medical staff is currently a policy
priority in the NHS and has a number of potential advantages,
such as improving access to care, enhancing continuity of support
and reducing morbidity. A key aim of such models is to improve
quality and save lives. However, our study does not support the
claim that safety is compromised at weekends, at least in mental
health services.
