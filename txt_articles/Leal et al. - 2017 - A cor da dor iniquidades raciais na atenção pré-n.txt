Abstract
Few studies on the influence of race/color on pregnancy and birthcare ex-
periences have been carried out in Brazil. Additionally, none of the existing 
studies are of national scope. This study sought to evaluate inequities in 
prenatal and childbirth care according to race/color using propensity score 
matching. The data comes from the study Birth in Brazil: National Survey 
into Labor and Birth, a national population study comprised of interviews 
and revisions of medical records that included 23,894 women in 2011/2012. 
We used logistic regressions to estimate odds ratios (OR) and respective 95% 
confidence intervals (95%CI) of race/color associated with the outcomes were 
analyzed. When compared with white-skinned women, black-skinned women 
were more likely to have inadequate prenatal care (OR = 1.6; 95%CI: 1.4-
1.9), to not be linked to a maternity hospital for childbirth (OR = 1.2 95%CI: 
1.1-1.4), to be without a companion (OR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.4-2.0), to seek more 
than one hospital for childbirth (OR =1.3; 95%CI: 1.2-1.5), and less likely to 
receive local anesthesia for an episiotomy (OR = 1.5; 95%CI: 1.1-2.1). Brown
-skinned women were also more likely to have inadequate prenatal care (OR 
= 1.2; 95%CI: 1.1-1.4) and to lack a companion (OR = 1.4; 95%CI: 1.3-1.6) 
when compared with white-skinned women. We identified racial disparities in 
care during pregnancy and childbirth, which displayed a gradient going from 
worst to best care provided to black, brown and white-skinned women.

Introduction
Over the past few decades, a substantial body of evidence has shown important racial disparities in 
Brazil in several dimensions of social life, including education, employment and living conditions 1,2. 
Racial inequalities have also been documented in health studies, which show that underprivileged 
groups, including black-skinned, mixed-race and indigenous people, suffer from higher levels of 
disease and are more exposed to death from preventable causes, ranging from infectious and parasitic 
disease to violence 3,4,5,6. Health studies point to the influence of race/color on the access to and the 
use of services 7,8,9,10. Consequently, the government implemented initiatives to address this inequal-
ity, including the Program for Confronting Institutional Racism, launched in 2005 11,12.
Among the program’s components is the mandatory recording of race/color in the country’s vital 
statistics, which has enabled comparative analyses among different racial groups and the monitoring 
of demographic, social, and health outcomes.
Though Brazil received a positive rating for most indicators in the recent Millennium Develop-
ment Goals analyses, there were clear shortcomings regarding promotion of gender equality, wom-
en’s autonomy and maternal mortality 13. Elevated levels of maternal mortality indicates failures in 
obstetric care from the prenatal stage up to birth. Brazil has achieved universal coverage of prenatal 
care and hospital birth, but studies have shown deficiencies in healthcare quality contributing to these 
negative outcomes regarding maternal and newborn health 13,14,15. Consistent with findings from 
other countries worldwide, pointing to markedly higher maternal mortality rates among ethnic and 
racial minority women 16,17, maternal mortality is two and a half times higher among black women 
than among white women in Brazil (Sistema de Informações sobre Mortalidade. http://tabnet.data 
sus.gov.br/cgi/tabcgi.exe?sim/cnv/mat10uf.def, accessed on 22/Apr/2016; Sistema de Informações 
sobre Nascidos Vivos. http://tabnet.datasus.gov.br/cgi/tabcgi.exe?sinasc/cnv/nvuf.def, accessed on 
22/Apr/2016).
Despite the importance of women and children’s health in Brazilian health policy, until now there 
have been few studies that analyze the influence of race/color on pregnancy care and birthcare. Gen-
erally speaking, existing investigations had been carried out in specific local contexts, with no nation-
wide analysis 18,19. Given this situation, the present paper sought to evaluate prenatal and childbirth 
care inequities in Brazil focusing on race/color using data from a nationwide investigation recently 
carried in the country.
Methods
Baseline study
This analysis is based on data from Birth in Brazil: National Survey into Labor and Birth, a population-
based study of national scope on pregnancy and childbirth care in Brazil between February 2011 
and October 2012 20. The sample was selected in three stages. The first stage included hospitals with 
500 or more childbirths/year, stratified by the country’s five macro regions, location (capital or non-
capital) and type of hospital (private, public or mixed). The second stage included the number of days 
needed to interview 90 post-natal women (minimum of seven days in each hospital) and the third 
included the post-natal women themselves. We sampled 266 hospitals (23,894 women). A detailed 
description of the sample design can be found in Vasconcellos et al. 21.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
In the study we included post-natal women admitted to maternity hospitals for childbirth and their 
live or dead offspring weighing ≥ 500g at birth and/or that had a gestational age ≥ 22 weeks. The 
exclusion criteria were: post-natal women with severe mental disorders that made it impossible for 
them to communicate with the interviewer; or who did not understand Portuguese; or who were deaf. 
Women were asked: “What is your color or race?” and were presented with the five categories used 
by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (white, black, brown, yellow and indigenous). 
 RACIAL INIQUITIES IN PRENATAL CARE AND CHILDBIRTH
3
Cad. Saúde Pública 2017; 33 Sup 1:e00078816
Those who identified themselves as yellow or indigenous were not included in the present analysis 
due to the extremely small number of women in these categories.
Matching variables
The women were categorized by the following variables: geographic region (North, Northeast, South-
east, South and Central); economic class (A+B, C, D+E) 22; mother’s age (< 20, 20-34, ≥ 35 years); 
years of schooling (< 8, 8-10, 11-14, 15 or more); source of funding for delivery (public or private), 
and parity (nulliparous, one previous childbirth, two previous childbirths, three or more previous 
childbirths). We used these variables to produce the propensity scores described below. Women who 
delivered in public hospitals and those who delivered in mixed hospitals, but whose births were not 
payed for by private health insurance, were classified as having a “public source of funding”. Women 
whose deliveries were payed for by private health insurance, whether they gave birth in private or 
mixed hospitals, and those who gave birth in private hospitals, regardless of whether or not the deliv-
ery was payed for by private health insurance, were classified as having a “private source of funding”.
Outcome variables
We considered the following outcomes: adequacy of prenatal care according to the Brazilian Ministry 
of Health guidelines; advice during prenatal care regarding possible complications during pregnancy 
(yes/no); advice given during prenatal care about early signs of labor (yes/no); linking to a maternity 
hospital for childbirth – pregnant women received advice regarding the unit where they would be 
admitted for delivery (yes/no); to seek more than one hospital for childbirth – pregnant women had 
to seek more than one hospital because she was refused in the first one (yes/no); presence of a com-
panion during labor and birth (at no time/at some time/at all times); type of birth (vaginal/cesarean); 
use of oxytocin (yes/no); episiotomy (yes/no); local anesthesia for an episiotomy (yes/no); epidural 
anesthesia (yes/no); gestational age at birth in weeks (early preterm – up to 33; late preterm – 34 to 
36; early term –  37 and 38; full term – 39 to 41, post-term – 42, and more); and reported women’s 
satisfaction with the care they received (excellent, good and regular/bad/terrible).
The right to access a maternity hospital was established in the Law 11,634, article 1, which states 
that “every pregnant woman assisted by the Unified Health System – SUS is entitled to previous knowledge of, 
and access to, the maternity hospital in which her delivery will take  place” 23.
In order to estimate the adequacy of prenatal care, we used an indicator of minimum prenatal care 
adequacy which considered sufficient prenatal care as: initiation of prenatal care up to the 12th gesta-
tional week; adequate number of appointments according to gestational age at birth, as recommended 
by the Brazilian Ministry of Health (at least one appointment in the first gestational trimester, two in 
the second, and three in the last trimester); records of at least one result for each of the recommended 
exams: glycaemia, urine, serology for syphilis, serology for HIV and ultrasound; and receiving advice 
from the maternity hospital regarding birthcare 15.
The explanatory hypotheses regarding the association between race/skin color and prenatal and 
childbirth care can be found in the supplementary diagram in Figure 1.
Propensity scores
The independent variable was the women’s post-natal race/color as identified by themselves, either 
white, black or brown-skinned. We separated the analysis into three distinct, binary comparisons: 
black versus white, black versus brown and brown versus white.
The multiple regression analysis, which is commonly used for adjusting potentially confounding 
factors, may be inadequate for the type of data analysis used in this study. This technique was initially 
developed to regulate small imbalances in randomized studies when, due to the study’s own design, 
those who are exposed and those who are unexposed to a treatment have an equivalent distribution 
of covariables. In our study, the distribution of outcomes and covariables related to prenatal and 
obstetric care vary greatly among regions in Brazil.

Propensity score matching is an alternative that deals with differences between groups in studies 
with non-experimental designs, such as the Birth in Brazil study. Since it is not possible to measure 
the effect of race/color for the same woman and compare situations in which she does and does not 
exhibit a certain outcome, we performed a comparison between similar post-natal women 24. Accord-
ing to Rosenbaum & Rubin 25, in order to identify an association it is necessary to have a valid com-
parison group similar in all characteristics to the group of treated individuals, except for race/color. 
The propensity score is the predicted probability, obtained through a multiple regression probit, of 
one case receiving a certain treatment versus a control case, subjected to the observed covariables. 
In this study, propensity scores were estimated based on the following variables: geographic region, 
economic class, mother’s age, years of schooling, source of payment for the childbirth and parity.
Statistical analysis
We selected individuals based on the “nearest neighbor matching within caliper” method, with a 
fixed maximum absolute difference of 0.2 between propensity scores, which generated distinct sub-
samples for each analysis. For the comparison of black-skinned post-natal women (treatment group) 
versus white-skinned post-natal women (control group) we adopted a 1:4 matching. We selected 
four white-skinned women for each black-skinned woman. The same was done for the comparison 
between black (treatment group) and brown-skinned post-natal women (control group). Finally, for 
the comparative analysis of brown (treatment group) versus white-skinned post-natal women (con-
trol group), we adopted a 1:1 strategy.
 RACIAL INIQUITIES IN PRENATAL CARE AND CHILDBIRTH
5
Cad. Saúde Pública 2017; 33 Sup 1:e00078816
We used simple, non-conditional logistical regression to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and respec-
tive 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) of the outcomes in the three comparisons: black versus white, 
black versus brown and brown versus white. We calculated these after matching with the propensity 
scores. We used the SPSS statistical package, version 22.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, USA).
Ethical considerations
This study followed the guidelines of the Brazilian National Health Council’s Resolution n. 196/1996, 
which establishes recommendations and standard procedures for research on humans. It was approved 
by the Ethics Research Committee of the Sergio Arouca National School of Public Health/Oswaldo 
Cruz Fountation under the process n. 92/10. All institution directors and interviewed post-natal 
women signed informed consent forms.
Results
All sociodemographic characteristics used for the propensity score matching were associated with 
race/color. In comparison with white-skinned women, black and brown-skinned women were more 
concentrated in the North and Northeast regions, where public funding for delivery was more com-
mon, more mothers tended to be adolescents, levels of schooling were lower, and they tended to 
belong to the economic classes D and E and had had three or more previous childbirths (Table 1).
The comparative analysis of black versus white-skinned post-natal women generated a sub-sam-
ple of 6,689 women, 1,840 of which were black and 4,849 were white, after propensity score match-
ing. Black-skinned post-natal women were more likely to have inadequate prenatal care (OR = 1.62; 
95%CI: 1.38-1.91), to not have been informed or linked to a maternity hospital for childbirth (OR = 
1.23; 95%CI: 1.10-1.37), to be without a companion (OR = 1.67; 95%CI: 1.42-1.97) and to search more 
than one hospital for childbirth (OR = 1.33; 95%CI: 1.15-1.54). Black-skinned women also received 
less advice during prenatal care about early signs of labor and possible complications during preg-
nancy. Despite having lower odds of cesarean birth and of painful interventions during vaginal birth, 
such as episiotomy and use of oxytocin, when compared with white-skinned women. Black-skinned 
women were also less likely to receive local anesthesia when episiotomies were performed (OR = 
1.49; 95%CI: 1.06-2.08). The odds of post-term birth, in relation to full term birth (39-41 weeks), were 
greater among black-skinned women than among white-skinned women (see Table 2).
The comparison between brown and white-skinned post-natal women produced a sub-sample of 
13,318 women, of which 6,659 were brown and 6,659 white. Brown-skinned women were more likely 
to have inadequate prenatal care (OR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.12-1.36) and to be without a companion (OR = 
1.41; 95%CI: 1.27-1.57). Brown-skinned women had lower odds of giving birth via caesarean section 
or having an episiotomy and lower odds of oxytocin use during vaginal birth. They also had higher 
odds of post-term births when compared with white-skinned women (Table 3).
In the comparison between black and brown-skinned women, the sub-sample comprised 9,006 
women, of which 1,804 were black-skinned and 7,202 were brown-skinned. Inadequate prenatal 
care, no information or linking to a maternity hospital and lack of advice regarding early signs of 
labor during prenatal care were more frequently observed among black-skinned women. There were 
significant differences for the remaining outcomes (Table 4).
Discussion
The analysis of the variables selected for matching in the construction of the propensity score showed 
large social and economic disparities among women according to race/color. Nonetheless, after being 
matched based on all those characteristics, we found that black and brown-skinned women received 
poorer prenatal care and birthcare when compared with white-skinned women. Despite the fact that 
black and brown-skinned women shared some similarities, adequacy of prenatal care and access to a 
maternity hospital was worse among black-skinned women.

We identified a gradient of worse to better care among black, brown and white-skinned women 
for most of the outcomes analyzed, showing aspects of everyday health services that resulted in dif-
ferent opportunities and benefits according to race/color, to the detriment of brown-skinned and 
black-skinned women. Even after controlling for sociodemographic variables using propensity score 
matching, black and brown-skinned women, when compared with white-skinned women, presented 
worse prenatal and birth care outcomes. Although black and brown-skinned women shared several 
similarities in terms of the analyzed outcomes, black-skinned women showed worse results regard-
ing the quality of prenatal care. Thus, the analyses presented in this study signal clear and worrying 
evidence of race/color inequalities in prenatal and birth conditions for Brazilian women, previously 
investigated based on case studies in specific locations in the country 18,26. Even if the population 
composition and inequality levels are different, there is evidence of inequities in the prenatal and birth 
care conditions for several other countries whose vital statistics and service use records include data 
on ethnic-racial identity 27,28.
At first glance, it would appear that lower exposure to interventions such as oxytocin use, episiot-
omy and births via caesarean section among black and brown-skinned women when compared with 
white-skinned women improves care, as the recommendations of the Brazilian Ministry of Health 
would suggest 29. However, in clinical practice, the obstetric assistance model adopted in Brazil favors

intervention and healthcare professionals largely perceive these practices not only as adequate, but as 
indicative of “good care” 30.
In Brazil, there is an excess number of births at gestational ages of 37 and 38 weeks, which is 
mainly due to scheduled cesarean births 31. However, black and brown-skinned women differ from 
white-skinned women in that they present higher post-term birth prevalence, probably a reflection 
of “less care” due to fewer interventions than necessary, which may have been required for children 
born post-term. Though this study was not specifically designed to address this issue, we believe this 
pattern of different levels of care may be related to discrimination due to race/color.
What is especially abnormal, as well as revealing of the impacts of race/color inequality, is the 
finding that women belonging to the most highly discriminated ethnic-racial groups are less likely to 
receive analgesia. Several investigations, many in the United States, have shown abnormalities in the 
use of analgesia in emergency services for adults and children, especially victimizing African Ameri-
cans 32,33,34,35. Results for Brazilian women, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables, 
indicate a lower use of analgesia in black-skinned women. A decade ago, in a study carried out in a 
sample of  a maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro municipality, Leal et al. 18 also found that anesthetic 
procedures for vaginal births were less commonly offered to black and brown-skinned women, with 
even lower proportions for women with poorer education.
According to Hoffman et al. 36, it is possible that the disparity in the use of analgesia according to 
racial groups is associated with social perceptions based on the existence of intrinsic biological dif-
ferences concerning pain sensibility. These authors interviewed medical students and residents and 
found that perspectives they identified as “internalized racism” were common. According to these 
perspectives, when comparing black and white-skinned individuals, the former were perceived to 
be more resistant to pain. The topic of healthcare professionals’ perceptions regarding relationships 
between race and resistance to pain has yet to be studied in Brazil. Even though this was not system-
atically analyzed in the Birth in Brazil study, there were occasions, such as in obstetrics services in Rio 
de Janeiro, in which healthcare professionals made reference to the fact that black women’s pelvises 
were better adapted to giving birth, which would justify not using analgesia.
This study’s findings indicate that, beyond the events immediately surrounding birth, race/color 
inequalities extended to the broader process of pregnancy. Black and brown-skinned women, in addi-
tion to having fewer prenatal care appointments and exams, had poorer access to maternity hospitals 
for delivery and received less advice, which resulted in seeking more than one hospital and travelling 
long distances to give birth. The right of women to have a companion during labor was also affected, 
which was more often violated among black and brown-skinned women than among white-skinned 
women, following the color gradient. Despite the fact that the right to a freely-chosen companion 
is guaranteed for all pregnant women by the Law 11,108, the Birth in Brazil study found that 25% of 
women were left with no companions during their entire hospital stay 37,38. As a result of several 
issues, especially the inability of maternity hospitals to guarantee this right to all women, some form 
of selection was shown to occur during admission for birth. Well-informed women who are aware 
of their rights, who are linked to a maternity hospital during their prenatal care, who have friends or 
relatives among the maternity staff, may be at an advantage. Faced with the study’s data, it would not 
be unreasonable to imagine that black and brown-skinned women would be less likely to be granted 
the right to have companionship. Solitude during the hospital stay was associated with reports of 
greater mistreatment by the health services, a worse relationship with healthcare professionals and 
lower levels of satisfaction with the care provided 39.
Inequalities in access to and in the process of care, according to Donabedian 39, have distinct ori-
gins. The first is related to the structure of the health services, such as, for instance, human resources 
and equipment availability, geographic accessibility, service supply and acceptance of, or adhesion to, 
treatment; the second mainly encompasses activities carried out by healthcare professionals and is 
directly related to the quality and equity of the care it provides. These definitions may help to better 
identify critical areas for reducing the racial differences we have observed. The effects and conse-
quences of exposure to racial discrimination for individuals and groups may be lasting, if not perma-
nent, as is widely acknowledged in other literature on the subject. In the health field, continued racial 
discrimination may generate high levels of physical and psycho-social stress and contribute to poor 
medical practices such as not adhering to proper treatment, which could even lead to disease 40,41. 
 RACIAL INIQUITIES IN PRENATAL CARE AND CHILDBIRTH

Brazilian data point to a greater prevalence of postpartum depression among black-skinned women, 
even after controlling for confounding factors such as socioeconomic characteristics, in addition to 
negative outcomes for the newborn 7.
Internationally, especially in North-American literature on racial discrimination in health ser-
vices between white-skinned and African-American people, there is a growing number of studies 
concerning racial discrimination in health services, including at the institutional and interpersonal 
levels and at the level of internalizing discriminatory experiences 33. One of the difficulties faced 
when conducting this type of inquiry is the availability of instruments for measuring the frequency of 
discrimination 42,43. In Brazil, despite the increasingly available literature on the topic, studies are still 
predominantly descriptive, rarely focusing on measuring racial discrimination in healthcare services 
and/or analyzing user perceptions 44.
As multiple authors have highlighted, we must acknowledge the considerable intersectionality 
that is present in cases of discrimination, with which race/color are associated and reinforce dimen-
sions related to the socioeconomic and gender conditions, among others 45,46. In two nationwide 
Brazilian studies, carried out in 2003 and 2013, the main reasons identified for the perception of dis-
crimination in health services were poverty and social class 47,48. The explicit mention of race/color 
was much lower, occupying fifth place in both studies, which is in line with other analyses of social 
perceptions of relationships between race/color and health in Brazil 49. It is worth highlighting that 
Boccolini et al. showed that, though women did not report race/color as the main reason for discrimi-
nation, in the multivariate analysis black-skinned women were the ones who reported discrimination 
most, albeit for reasons other than just race/color 48.
Differences in this study regarding satisfaction with care received during admission to child-
birth among white, brown and black-skinned women were not statistically significant. One possible 
explanation is that this satisfaction is influenced by other factors not including those we have already 
discussed, such as wanting to be pregnant and negative outcomes in the newborn (prematurity, fetal 
death, congenital malformation, neonatal death and admission to a neonatal intensive care unit) 
which were not studied in this article. In a supplementary analysis, white and brown-skinned women 
who did not want to be pregnant, or wanted to be pregnant but not at that time, reported lower lev-
els of satisfaction with the care they received during their hospital stay than women who wanted to 
be pregnant at that time, even after using the propensity score (Table 5). However, this fact was not 
observed among black-skinned women, which suggests that other factors may be responsible for dis-
satisfaction with care in this cohort.
In regard to studies on race/color inequalities in Brazil, this research is of methodological value 
at the level of data analysis, and has implications that go beyond the health component. Over the 
course of the past decade, social movements have emphasized the centrality of the “black population” 
(“população negra”) construct, which generally involves the grouping together of black and brown-
skinned categories 4. With the development of policies related to race/color, there are authors who 
suggest that the fusion of the brown and black-skinned women categories could result in interpreta-
tions that underestimate patterns of inequality 50,51. As such, this study’s findings are illustrative of 
the importance of separating analyses as much as possible. For example, the association of race/color 
and analgesia was present in the comparison between black and white-skinned women, but would 
not be explicit if white-skinned women had been compared to a group consisting of both black and 
brown-skinned women. Therefore, when generating analytical race/color categories, both in data 
collection and analysis, it is important to explore associations in the different strata, without using a 
priori groupings, as important as they may be from a social-political perspective.
This investigation has several strengths. Firstly, this was the first national study that included 
primary data on labor and birth, originating from a representative sample of pregnant women in the 
year 2011, encompassing all Brazilian states. Secondly, the data relating to medical procedures were 
collected from hospital records, which increases their internal validity. Lastly, we used the propensity 
score matching technique, an analytical tool which enables meticulous matching of the groups being 
compared, making them very similar except for the variable of interest (in this study, race/color). It 
is a type of analysis which enables a precise adjustment of confounding factors and has been used in 
studies on race/color inequalities, not only cases relating to social determinants and healthcare, but 
also in other facets of social life (education, justice, among others) 24,52.

Nonetheless, this study has its limitations. One is that the Birth in Brazil study was not designed to 
specifically investigate actors and mechanisms involved with discrimination based on race in prenatal 
and birth healthcare services in the country. For this reason, aspects such as using a scale to measure 
discrimination, as well was carrying out a qualitative study on race/color, were not considered. Fur-
thermore, in addition to the women’s self-classification, it would be useful to know how healthcare 
professionals classify these women (hetero-classification), since this classification formed the basis 
for the observed inequalities. There are recent studies in Brazil which point to important differences 
when comparing self- and hetero-classifications on an individual level, especially within the brown-
skinned category 53,54. Lastly, despite the study’s scope, we did not address all segments of the popula-
tion, such as indigenous Brazilians, who are known to be vulnerable in terms of their health condition 
and general socioeconomic situation 55.
The improvement in the quality of healthcare requires the elimination of racial inequity. As we 
have shown in this study, these components should not be separated. Racial inequality in prenatal 
and birthcare contributes to disparities in health indicators. The Brazilian health system has as its 
principles of universality, comprehensiveness and social participation 56. We recognize that these 
inequalities have their origins in society and that an isolated effort by the health sector may not be able 
to correct such inequality. Nevertheless, we suggest that the current situation is modified by elimi-
nating racial discrimination, along with other factors, in the healthcare system, since this item is an 
indicator of service quality for accrediting hospitals, as recommended by Fiscella et al. 32. At the same 
time, it is crucial that we broaden the debate and awareness surrounding the matter so as to identify 
and confront practices that potentially result in the inequities we have observed. This will be achieved 
primarily by educating healthcare professionals about the issue.

Resumo
Poucas pesquisas com foco nas influências da ra-
ça/cor no tocante à experiência de gestação e par-
to foram conduzidas no Brasil, sendo inédita a 
análise de abrangência nacional. Este estudo teve 
como objetivo avaliar as iniquidades na atenção 
pré-natal e parto de acordo com a raça/cor utili-
zando o método de pareamento baseado nos escores 
de propensão. Os dados são oriundos da pesquisa 
 
Nascer no Brasil: Pesquisa Nacional sobre 
Parto e Nascimento, um estudo de base popu-
lacional de abrangência nacional com entrevista 
e avaliação de prontuários de 23.894 mulheres 
em 2011/2012. Regressões logísticas simples fo-
ram utilizadas para estimar as razões de chance 
(OR) e respectivos intervalos de 95% de confiança 
(IC95%) da raça/cor associada aos desfechos ana-
lisados. Em comparação às brancas, puérperas de 
cor preta possuíram maior risco de terem um pré-
natal inadequado (OR = 1,6; IC95%: 1,4-1,9), fal-
ta de vinculação à maternidade (OR = 1,2; IC95%: 
1,1-1,4), ausência de acompanhante (OR = 1,7; 
IC95%: 1,4-2,0), peregrinação para o parto (OR = 
1,3; IC95%: 1,2-1,5) e menos anestesia local para 
episiotomia (OR = 1,5 (IC95%: 1,1-2,1). Puérperas 
de cor parda também tiveram maior risco de te-
rem um pré-natal inadequado (OR = 1,2; IC95%: 
1,1-1,4) e ausência de acompanhante (OR = 1,4; 
IC95%: 1,3-1,6) quando comparadas às brancas. 
Foram identificadas disparidades raciais no pro-
cesso de atenção à gestação e ao parto evidencian-
do um gradiente de pior para melhor cuidado entre 
mulheres pretas, pardas e brancas.

Resumen
Existen pocas investigaciones realizadas en Bra-
sil centradas en las influencias de la raza/color, 
en lo que se refiere a la experiencia de la gesta-
ción y parto, siendo inédito un análisis de alcance 
nacional. Este estudio tuvo como objetivo evaluar 
las inequidades en la atención pre-natal y parto, 
de acuerdo a la raza/color, utilizando el método de 
apareamiento, basado en los marcadores de pro-
pensión. Los datos provienen de la investigación 
Nacer en Brasil: Investigación Nacional sobre 
Parto y Nacimiento, un estudio de base pobla-
cional de alcance nacional con entrevista y eva-
luación de historiales médicos de 23.894 mujeres 
en 2011/2012. Se utilizaron regresiones logísticas 
simples para estimar las razones de oportunidad 
(OR) y sus respectivos intervalos de un 95% de 
confianza (IC95%) de la raza/color asociados a los 
desenlaces analizados. En comparación a las blan-
cas, las puérperas de color negro tuvieron un ma-
yor riesgo de tener un período pre-natal inadecua-
do (OR = 1,6; IC95%: 1,4-1,9), falta de vincula-
ción a la maternidad (OR = 1,2; IC95%: 1,1-1,4), 
ausencia de acompañante (OR = 1,7; IC95%: 1,4-
2,0), grandes desplazamientos para el parto (OR = 
1,3; IC95%: 1,2-1,5) y menos anestesia local para 
episiotomía (OR = 1,5; IC95%: 1,1-2,1). Las puér-
peras mulatas también tuvieron un mayor riesgo 
de tener un período pre-natal inadecuado (OR = 
1,2; IC95%: 1,1-1,4) y ausencia de acompañante 
(OR = 1,4; IC95%: 1,3-1,6), cuando se comparan 
con las blancas. Fueron identificadas disparidades 
raciales en el proceso de atención a la gestación y 
al parto, evidenciando un gradiente de peor pa-
ra mejor cuidado entre mujeres negras, mulatas 
 
y blancas.
