Abstract
Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients have central nervous system (CNS) lesions that may
impede cognitive and sensorimotor function. Few rehabilitative therapies are available.
Objectives: The objective of this paper is to study effects of noninvasive tongue stimulation using the
Portable Neuromodulation Stimulator (PoNSTM) combined with intensive cognitive and physical
rehabilitation on working memory, gait, balance and concomitant changes in the brain.
Methods: Fourteen MS patients, seven each in an active and a sham stimulation group, participated.
Participants received intensive physical therapy and working memory training for 14 weeks. Functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using motor imagery and working-memory tasks were completed
prior to and following therapy, as were sensory organization tests (SOT), motor performance measures,
and neuropsychological assessment.
Results: On the SOT, the active group showed significant improvement from baseline. fMRI revealed
significant blood oxygen level-dependent signal changes in the left primary motor cortex for the Active
Group, while the sham group had increased activity in bilateral premotor cortices. All individuals
improved on working-memory tasks, but only the active group showed increased dorsolateral prefrontal
cortex activity.
Conclusions: In this cohort of MS patients, the results suggest that PoNS stimulation can enhance motor
performance and working memory while also driving neuroplasticity. Further studies are warranted to
explore these findings.

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects more than 500,000
patients in North America and is associated with
diminished quality of life and productivity. MS
patients have central nervous system (CNS) lesions
that may impede cognitive and sensorimotor func-
tion.1�3 Proficient ambulation is often used as a
metric of disease progression4,5 and, in this regard,
as many as 40% of MS patients require walking
assistance within 15 years of disease onset.6 The
need for low-cost therapeutic intervention to address
these effects of MS is pressing.
Functional electrical stimulation using surface elec-
trodes has been shown to effectively improve gait,
but only when the stimulator is active.7�9 Studies
have shown that the tongue can be used as an effect-
ive interface for conveying electrical signals to the
CNS,10�13 including sensory substitution in balance-
impaired or blind people.14�17 Individuals with pri-
mary vestibular disorders using electrical stimulation
of the tongue together with head-position informa-
tion demonstrated sustained balance improvements
beyond their final stimulation session.13,14 In the pre-
sent

 neuromodulation (CN-NINM), a form of electrotac-
tile stimulation delivered by a portable neuromodu-
lation stimulator device (PoNSTM14) that sends a
series of small electrical pulses via a tongue elec-
trode array to try to improve balance and gait prob-
lems in patients with MS. We also investigated
whether this kind of stimulation could improve
working memory in these patients.
Tyler et al.14 reported on chronic MS patients with
gait disturbance and demonstrated improved gait
with
CN-NINM
training.
They
intimated
that
tongue-based neuro-stimulation may amplify the
benefits of physical therapy for improving gait in
such patients. Recent fMRI studies suggest that
motor improvements following electrical stimulation
of the tongue are likely related to modulation of
neural activity within structures of the brain that con-
trol balance and movement.13,14,18,19
The present study used a multimodal neuroimaging
approach to examine neuromodulation associated
with CN-NINM training and to explore the benefi-
cial effects of PoNSTM stimulation as reported by
Tyler et al.14 We adapted a gait imagery functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task previously
used to study gait and balance in Parkinson’s disease
(PD) patients.20 In that study, PD patients showed
more brain activity in the supplementary motor
area (SMA) than control participants during the
gait imagery task, and this increase was interpreted
as compensatory in nature. Furthermore, it was sug-
gested that higher activity in locomotor regions
could be used to predict improved gait function.20
Based on these findings, but cognizant of the differ-
ent lesion patterns, we hypothesized that compared
to post-training scans, our baseline fMRI results in
MS subjects would be characterized by greater acti-
vation in the SMA and by reduced activation in the
primary motor cortex and cerebellum. We expected
this pattern to be reversed in post-training follow-up
scans. In addition to motor function, we speculated
that working-memory rehabilitation training could
also
facilitate
improvement
in
cognitive
func-
tion.21�23 To address this possibility, we used a
probe working-memory task to document putative
functional change associated with working-memory
rehabilitation training. This task has been used pre-
viously in healthy normal controls and in mild trau-
matic brain injury (mTBI) patients.24,25 The control
group showed strong activation within the dorsolat-
eral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), whereas mTBI
patients with post-concussive symptoms displayed
reduced activation in the DLPFC.24,25 We hypothe-
sized that MS patients would display greater DLPFC
activation following rehabilitation training with the
PoNS device.
Methods
Patient population
Participants were randomly assigned to two groups
regardless of age, gender, individual Expanded
Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, disease state,
functional status, or MS chronicity: seven in a PoNS
Stimulation Group (active group) and seven in a
Sham PoNSTM Stimulation Group (Sham Group).
Demographic information is presented in Table 1.
At the end of the study, individuals assigned to the
sham group were offered the opportunity to use the
active device, and five individuals returned and com-
pleted the active training (rollover group).
Active group members used a device providing per-
ceivable electrical stimulation, whereas the sham
group used a device providing a non-perceivable
stimulus. Therapists and other research personnel
were not informed as to which group an individual
belonged,
and
participants
and
therapists
were
instructed not to discuss any details of the stimulus
sensation with each other. Additionally, individuals
were instructed not to adjust the stimulus intensity in
the presence of therapists. Questions about device

Procedure
Prior to the start of CN-NINM training, each partici-
pant underwent baseline evaluations including struc-
tural and fMRI, balance tests (SOT), Dynamic Gait

(DGI),

In
addition,
the
MS
Impairment Scale, Fatigue Impact Scale, Cognitive
Function Inventory for MS, and Beck Depression
and Anxiety questionnaires were completed.
Each participant was issued his or her own PoNS
device version 2.2. The PI instructed individuals in
use and maintenance of the device accompanied by
written instructions (in English or French as appro-
priate). The PoNS device (see Figures 1 and 2) is
held lightly in place by the lips and teeth around the
neck of the tab that goes into the mouth and rests on
the anterior, superior part of the tongue.14 Active
group members adjusted the PoNS stimulus until
felt as a moderately intense tingling sensation. The
sham device required no stimulus adjustment.
Training procedure
Trainers (physiotherapists and exercise physiolo-
gists) all underwent the same intensive educational
program to ensure consistent therapy was offered to
participants. The CN-NINM protocol consisted of
two stages: first an in-lab training program during
which therapists developed subject-specific regimens
appropriate to ability levels. In this stage, individuals
completed twice-daily training sessions at the study
center under the supervision of a CN-NINM certified
trainer for two weeks (excluding weekends). The
morning and afternoon sessions consisted of 90-
minute physical therapy sessions and were separated
by a three- to four-hour break. Therapy included:
warm-up, balance, gait, motor control exercises,
and breathing and awareness techniques (BAT). In
addition, participants were asked to perform a BAT
session using the PoNS at least one hour before bed-
time. Subject exercise programs were reviewed daily
during the in-lab training phase.

 Stage 2 was 12 weeks of at-home training where
individuals performed the same exercises as those
learned during the in-lab phase. During both stages,
participants completed three sessions per day: morn-
ing,
afternoon
and
evening.
Working-Memory
retraining
employed
the
COGMED
package26
administered on a computer screen. Visuospatial
and verbal working-memory training automatically
identified the participant’s maximum threshold, and
administered tasks aimed to increase that threshold
(completed four times per week for approximately
10 weeks).
Participants returned every two weeks for re-evalua-
tion and ‘‘fine tuning’’ of their programs during
which the trainer evaluated their abilities and
adjusted
the
intervention
activities
accordingly.
These bi-weekly sessions also included SOT and
DGI reassessments.
Following the 14 weeks of training, the tests per-
formed
at
pre-training
baseline
were
repeated,
including
the
SOT,
DGI,
Neuropsychological
Assessment (NA), and structural and fMRI. For the
NA the same order of tests was employed as in the
pre-training assessment.
Baseline and post CN-NINM training sessions
SOT. The SOT measured baseline stability under six
progressively difficult conditions. For the easiest
condition, participants stood on a fixed platform
with their eyes open and therefore vision and som-
atosensory inputs were permitted. For the most dif-
ficult condition the individuals’ visual surround and
the platform surface were swayed and therefore the
visual surround and somatosensory inputs were con-
flicted � thus isolating the vestibular system.27
DGI. Tasks included: steady state walking; walking
with changing speeds, with head turns horizontally
and vertically, stepping over and around obstacles;
pivoting, and stair climbing.28
NA. The NA was carried out by a clinical neuro-
psychologist and took approximately 150 minutes.
fMRI. MRI used a 3-Tesla Siemens Magnetom Trio
A Tim System with a 32-channel head coil (for
image acquisition see supplementary information).
Gait imagery fMRI. The task consisted of three gait
conditions, namely STAND (S), WALK (W), and
REST (R). W consisted of a video clip that showed
an actor first standing and then walking in an ego-
centric perspective. S showed an actor standing
upright with no movement. R was a fixation cross
at the center of the screen. The participant is
prompted to identify himself or herself as the actor
and to mentally imitate the movements as viewed in
the clips. Each condition (S, W, R) lasted 18 sec-
onds, with a six-second interval between each for
preparation. For the latter, a blank display was
shown for 4.5 seconds followed by a 1.5-second
instruction sentence. Each functional run consisted
of four blocks of each condition presented pseudo-
randomly, to avoid the same condition being pre-
sented consecutively, for a total of four minutes
and 48 seconds (see Figure 3).
Working-memory fMRI. In the probe task, partici-
pants were familiarized with five abstract drawings.
During each trial, four of five items were presented
successively in random order at the center of a com-
puter screen. After presentation of the fourth item, a
delay of one second was introduced. A test item was
then presented and the participant had to indicate
within 1.5 seconds by button press whether this test

 item was one of the four items presented prior to the
delay or whether it was an item that had not been
presented. In the baseline control condition, the
format and type of stimulus presentation, mode of
response, and the timing of events were identical to
the experimental working-memory task. During
stimulus presentation in each control trial, one item
was presented four times in succession at the center
of the screen, followed by a delay of one second.
After
the
delay,
one
of
two
different
items
associated with either a left or a right mouse
button press was presented at the center of the
screen and the participant had 1.5 seconds to respond
(see Figure 4).
Statistical analyses of behavioral measures were
completed with Systat version 23.0 (SPSS Inc).
The observed differences between pre- and post-
training in both groups were compared using two-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with group
(active or sham) as the between-subject factor and
time (pre-training and post-training) as the repeated
measure. The dependent variables were the scores on
the neuropsychological tests and the self-report ques-
tionnaires (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II,
Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Modified Fatigue
Scale, MS Impact Scale, and Cognitive Function).
DGI and SOT were assessed at baseline and after
each two-week interval and these scores were
analyzed.
Results
Behavioral measures
On the MFIS, MSIS-29, and Cognitive Function
questionnaires there were no significant changes in
either group over time nor were there on the BDI-11
or BAI. The findings on the latter two tests are inter-
esting in that this cohort of MS patients were neither
clinically depressed nor anxious.
Neuropsychology tests
Participants completed detailed neuropsychological
testing pre- and post-training and there was a trend
for the active group to benefit more. Both groups
demonstrated improvement on most cognitive meas-
ures, but because of multiple comparisons, we set the
p value to 0.01. The following areas showed signifi-
cant improvement: Symbol Search, Colour-Word
Naming
and
Inhibition,
and
Trail
Making
Switching; except for Colour-Word naming, all
have a working-memory component. Both groups
demonstrated very significant improvement on their
COGMED scores from baseline to post-training
(p > 0.0001). The Group � Time interaction was
not significant; however, there was a trend for the
active group to show more improvement (p ¼ 0.15).
SOT
We analyzed the total composite score, and we note
that both groups show a trend for improvement over

 time (see Figure 4), but it is more consistent for the
active group. T tests comparing the week 14 score to
the pre-score reveals that the improvement for the
active group is significant (p < 0.001), whereas the
sham group difference did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (p < 0.06). For the rollover group, the
results show a steady increase in mean SOT scores
from initial baseline to final testing (baseline: 49.80;
sham: 61.60; sham-rollover: 68.0; see Figure 5).
Repeated ANOVA showed a significant effect of
stimulation on SOT (F(1,4) ¼ 16.529, p ¼ 0.015);
pairwise comparison indicated that SOT scores
improved significantly from baseline to post-CN-
NINM training (p ¼ 0.046).
DGI
Analysis of the difference scores revealed a non-sig-
nificant trend in the direction of the active group
showing greater improvement over time and parallel
the results of Tyler et al.14 For the rollover group no
difference was found in DGI scores (T1 ¼ 13.0;
T2 ¼ 13.60 and T3 ¼ 14.2). We note that these
scores are in the impaired range.
Neuroimaging
Gait imagery fMRI. For the active group, pre- and
post-CN-NINM training fMRI showed task-related
activations in bilateral premotor and motor regions.
Paired t-test comparing post- vs. pre-training scans
revealed a significant increase in blood oxygen level-
dependent (BOLD) signal in the left motor cortex
(t ¼ 3.015, p ¼ 0.024), as we had predicted. We had
hypothesized a reduction in the magnitude of activa-
tion in the premotor regions, but that is not evident.
Interestingly, the left premotor cortex showed a sig-
nificant increase in BOLD signal after CN-NINM
training (Figure 6). For the sham group, pre- and
post-training fMRI also showed task-related activa-
tions in bilateral premotor and motor regions. Paired-
t test comparing post- vs. pre-PoNS scans revealed a
significant increase in BOLD signal in bilateral pre-
motor regions only (left: t ¼ 3.067, p ¼ 0.02; right:
t ¼ 4.167, p ¼ 0.006; Figure 6). In the rollover group,
the fMRI at the end of the active stimulation indi-
cated further increase in activation in bilateral pri-
mary motor cortices and a reduction in activation in
bilateral premotor cortices compared to sham stimu-
lation, findings very similar to the active group;
however, these were not statistically significant.
Working-memory fMRI. The active group baseline
fMRI shows activation peaks in bilateral DLPFC
and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC),
but the activation in the left DLPFC is too weak
for statistical significance (Figure 6). Consistent
with our hypothesis, post-CN-NINM training fMRI
shows significant increases in BOLD signal in the
left DLPFC (t ¼ 3.55, p ¼ 0.01), dACC (t ¼ 3.057,
p ¼ 0.02) and a trend toward significance in the
right DLPFC (t ¼ 2.3, p ¼ 0.06). For the sham
group, baseline as well as post-training fMRI
shows sub-threshold peaks in bilateral DLPFC and
rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Paired t-
tests comparing pre- and post-training scans did not
reveal any significant changes (Figure 6). Of note,
the rollover group showed greater activation in bilat-
eral DLPFC following active stimulation compared
to baseline and sham stimulation; this trend in
increased activation was not statistically significant.

 Discussion
A noteworthy finding from this pilot study is that
there
were
significant
effects
of
interventions
across the wide range of cognitive domains both in
the active and in the sham groups, albeit with a trend
of greater improvement in the active group. This
general improvement could be, at least in part, attrib-
utable to practice effects but are more likely the
effects of the working-memory retraining in combin-
ation with intensive physical therapy.
We employed COGMED retraining to try to drive
neuroplasticity
in
working-memory-related
brain
regions. Consistent with our hypothesis, post-PoNS
training fMRI showed a significant increase in
BOLD signal in the left DLPFC and rACC and a
trend for significance in the right, whereas the
sham group showed sub-threshold peaks in these
regions. Notwithstanding these imaging findings,
corresponding improvements in formal testing of
working
memory
were
not
evidenced
between
groups.
For the active group, functional imaging analyses for
the Gait Imagery task revealed that baseline and post
14-weeks’ training showed task-related activations in
bilateral premotor and motor regions, and the BOLD
signal in the left motor cortex was significantly
higher, as we had hypothesized. We had predicted
a reduction in the magnitude of activation in the pre-
motor regions, but this was not apparent, though a
non-significant reduction in BOLD signal in the right
premotor cortex was observed. In the sham group,
significant BOLD changes were documented only in
the premotor regions, bilaterally. The functional sig-
nificance of these findings could be related to
improved motor output for the active group, espe-
cially in light of the fact that the left hemisphere is
considered to be more important for skilled motor
performance.29
As
was
the
case
for
working
memory, formal tests of motor ability including
DGI, pegboards, and movement sequencing did not
show differences between groups.
For exploratory purposes, we compared fMRI BOLD
data from the four motor regions of interest (ROIs) to
the imaging data of healthy control participants. At
baseline, the active group showed task-related acti-
vations comparable to that of healthy controls in all
ROIs except the left motor cortex. The magnitude of
the activation in the latter became comparable to that
of the healthy controls after PoNS training, and this
is an interesting finding that may indicate causality.
The
sham
group’s
baseline
fMRI
showed

 significantly weaker task-related activations com-
pared to the controls in all ROIs except the left pre-
motor cortex. After PoNS training, activation in the
left and right premotor cortex was comparable to that
of controls, while activation in the left and right
motor cortex remained significantly weaker. We
speculate that this could be related to the presence
of poor motor skills in the sham group. We went on
to compare the fMRI BOLD data from the three pre-
frontal ROIs to our imaging data from 16 healthy
controls in another study on TBI.24 We observed
that at baseline, the active group had significantly
weaker task-related activations compared to that of
these healthy controls in all three prefrontal ROIs.
The magnitude of the BOLD signal in all three ROIs
became comparable to that of the healthy controls
following PoNS training. In contrast, the Sham
Group showed significantly weaker task-related acti-
vation in all three ROIs at baseline and it remained
unchanged following PoNS training.
On the SOT, we demonstrated an improvement over
time following PoNS training for both the active and
for the rollover group suggesting that this training
can have a positive effect on balance in patients
with MS. The improvement that we document in
balance associated with PoNS stimulation probably
has ramifications for improved and safer locomotion.
A major shortcoming of this study is the low number
of participants (however, this fact is mitigated by the
repeated design) in each group, and the findings sug-
gest the need for a larger study that balances disease
duration across groups.
