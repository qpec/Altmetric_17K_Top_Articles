Abstract Impact of stress on diseases including gastrointestinal failure is well-known, but
molecular mechanism is not understood. Here we show underlying molecular mechanism using EAE
mice. Under stress conditions, EAE caused severe gastrointestinal failure with high-mortality.
Mechanistically, autoreactive-pathogenic CD4+ T cells accumulated at specific vessels of boundary
area of third-ventricle, thalamus, and dentate-gyrus to establish brain micro-inflammation via stress-
gateway reflex. Importantly, induction of brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels by cytokine
injection was sufficient to establish fatal gastrointestinal failure. Resulting micro-inflammation
activated new neural pathway including neurons in paraventricular-nucleus, dorsomedial-nucleus-of-
hypothalamus, and also vagal neurons to cause fatal gastrointestinal failure. Suppression of the
brain micro-inflammation or blockage of these neural pathways inhibited the gastrointestinal
failure. These results demonstrate direct link between brain micro-inflammation and fatal
gastrointestinal disease via establishment of a new neural pathway under stress. They further

Introduction
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoreactive helper T cell (CD4+ T cell)-mediated autoimmune disease
in the central nervous system (CNS) (Sawcer et al., 2011). It can be divided into at least four sub-
groups: (1) relapse-remitting MS (over 80% patients), (2) secondary progressive MS (the late phase
of relapse-remitting type), (3) primary progressive MS (about 10% patients), and (4) relapse-pro-
gressing MS (about 5% patients), all of which are characterized by chronic inflammation in the CNS
(Steinman, 2009). MS inflammatory lesions consist of various immune cells, including CD4+ T cells
and MHC class II+CD11b+ monocytes/macrophages, and subsequent loss of neurological function
in the CNS due to the disruption of neural circuits that regulate various organ functions (Stein-
man, 2014). Indeed, several complications including mental illnesses and gastrointestinal failures are
associated with MS (Goldman Consensus Group, 2005; Gupta et al., 2005; Kimura et al., 2000;
Marrie et al., 2015; Pokorny et al., 2007; Rang et al., 1982; Sadovnick et al., 1989). To under-
stand the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of MS, experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) mice and rats have been designed (Miller et al., 1995; Steinman, 2009).
EAE development is dependent on autoreactive helper T cells (pathogenic CD4+ T cells), particularly
Th1 and Th17 cells and many immune cells are accumulated at the affected sites such as CD8+ T
cells, macrophages, B cells, and neutrophils. (Arima et al., 2012, 2015; Ja
¨ger et al., 2009). To
develop EAE, CNS autoantigens including myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), myelin basic
protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein (PLP) are immunized (Rangachari and Kuchroo, 2013). We
sorted CD4+ T cells from mice EAE induced with a MOG peptide plus complete Freund’s adjuvant
(CFA) (active EAE model) and stimulated the cells with a MOG peptide in the presence of MHC class
II+ antigen presenting cells and cytokines in vitro followed by intravenously injecting them into wild
type C57BL/6 mice (the transfer EAE model) (Arima et al., 2012, 2015; Rangachari and Kuchroo,
2013). Therefore, the transfer EAE model is completely dependent on MOG-specific CD4+ T cells
(pathogenic CD4+ T cells) including Th17 and Th1 populations, while it is not dependent on CD8+ T
cells because of no CD8+ T cells in the transferred pathogenic T cell population. Importantly, there
are many papers that describe the involvement of not only IL-17A but also IFN-g particularly from
pathogenic CD4+ T cells including activated Th1 and Th17 cells for the development of EAE models
including the transfer EAE ones (Duhen et al., 2013; El-behi et al., 2010; Goverman, 2009;
Ja
¨ger et al., 2009; Ottum et al., 2015). Using this transfer EAE model, we previously identified sev-
eral specific sensory-sympathetic connections generate immune cell-gateways at specific vessels in
the blood-brain barrier through which immune cells, including pathogenic CD4+ T cells, migrate to
the CNS as the gateway reflex in the research field of the neural signal system (Arima et al., 2012,
2015; Chavan et al., 2017; Mori et al., 2014; Pavlov and Tracey, 2017; Sabharwal et al., 2014;
Tracey, 2012, 2016).
Stress conditions can cause gastrointestinal diseases via the brain-gut axis. Animal models have
shown that this axis involves interactions between neural components, including the autonomic ner-
vous system, the central nervous system, the stress system such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adre-
nal axis, and the corticotropin-releasing factor system, and intestinal factors such as the intestinal
barrier, the luminal microbiota, and the intestinal immune response (Allen et al., 2014; Bonaz and
Bernstein, 2013; Caso et al., 2008; Stengel and Tache
´, 2009). However, details about the underly-
ing molecular mechanisms, including the relationship between each of these components, are
lacking.
In the present paper, we report a relationship between brain micro-inflammation and fatal gastro-
intestinal failure. We demonstrate that brain micro-inflammation at blood vessels specific in the
boundary area of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus is established by patho-
genic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress conditions and induces fatal gastrointestinal failure via a par-
aventricular
nucleus
(PVN)/dorsomedial
nucleus
of
the
hypothalamus
(DMH)-vagal
pathway.
Mechanistic analysis suggested that the gateway reflex triggered by stress-mediated PVN activation
induced the accumulation of immune cells, including pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class

 IIhiCD11b+ cells, at these specific vessels in a manner dependent on CCL5. The resulting brain
micro-inflammation enhanced a new neural pathway including neurons in the PVN and DMH, and
vagal nerve-mediated gastrointestinal failure via micro-inflammation-dependent ATP. Accordingly,
blockade of the regional brain micro-inflammation and establishment of the new neural pathway
inhibited the gastrointestinal pathology. These results suggest that brain micro-inflammation at spe-
cific vessels is a risk for severe gastrointestinal failure via the PVN/DMH-vagal neural pathway, indi-
cating a direct molecular link between brain micro-inflammation and organ dysfunction.
Results
Stress conditions cause a severe phenotype of EAE
To examine the impact of stress conditions in a transfer EAE model, we first employed a sleep disor-
der model, in which continuous stress is imposed on mice on a free rotation wheel for 2 days by the
perpetual avoidance of water (Miyazaki et al., 2013; Oishi et al., 2014). In the typical course of the
transfer EAE model, a loss of tonicity in the tail tip and ascending paralysis follows immune cell accu-
mulation at the lumbar (L)5 dorsal vessels after the intravenous transfer of pathogenic CD4+ T cells
(Arima et al., 2012). Pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under the stress condition of the current study
caused a severe phenotype including sudden death (Figure 1A). On the other hand, either stress or
pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer alone, or stress with the transfer of activated CD4+ T cells specific
for irrelevant antigens such as ovalbumin or a retinal autoantigen, interphotoreceptor retinoid-bind-
ing protein (IRBP), did not cause the severe phenotype, although the retina-specific activated CD4+
T cells accumulated in the eyes (Figure 1A and B and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B and C).
Blood aldosterone and cortisol levels were significantly higher in mice with stress even without path-
ogenic CD4+ T cell transfer (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B), suggesting stress-mediated
activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Another chronic stress model, in which mice
were reared in a cage with wet bedding after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer, showed similar results
(Figure 1C and D). However, transient stresses, such as immobilization stress and forced swimming
(20 min/day, 10 days), did not (Arima et al., 2015). These results demonstrate that chronic stress
conditions cause a severe and atypical phenotype of EAE, which might represent progressive MS.
Gastrointestinal failure is induced by pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer
under stress
We next investigated how pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress causes the severe pheno-
type. We noticed that mice induced with pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress, but not
either treatment only, excreted bloody stools (Figure 2A). Consistently, blood hematocrit levels
decreased (Figure 2B). We found the blood content came from the stomach and upper level of the
intestine (Figure 2C). Focal bleeding lesions in the stomach were detected by histopathological anal-
ysis (Figure 2D, black spots), and tissue distraction including epithelial necrosis was evident particu-
larly in the stomach and upper level of the intestine (Figure 2E). It has been reported that under
very strong stress, the activation of p38 and MAPKAPK2 contributes to stomach epithelial destruc-
tion under muscarinic M3 receptor signaling via acetyocholine derived from vagus nerve (Debas and
Carvajal, 1994; Jia et al., 2007; Uwada et al., 2017). These reports further showed that p38 inhibi-
tors could suppress the stomach epithelial destruction under very strong stress. We investigated the
activation status of p38 and MAPKAPK2 in stomach isolated from mice with pathogenic CD4+ T cell
transfer under our stress condition and detected phosphorylated p38 and phosphorylated MAP-
KAPK2 in the gastric mucosa (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). These results suggested tissue dam-
age in the stomach and the upper level of the intestine due to p38 and MAPKAPK2 activation in
mucosal tissues. Consistent with dysregulation of gastrointestinal region, the treatment with a pro-
ton pump inhibitor, lansoprazol, suppressed the severe phenotype in mice with pathogenic CD4+ T
cell transfer under stress condition (Figure 2F). Furthermore, increase of plasma potassium levels,
most likely following the gastrointestinal bleeding, was observed in mice with pathogenic CD4+ T
cell transfer under stress condition (Figure 2G).
Heart failure was detected in mice with pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress condition by
a cardiac electrocardiogram system (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), suggesting a heart failure at
least partially mediated by high potassium ions. These results suggested that fatal gastrointestinal

Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is developed in a manner
dependent on chemokines and inflammatory cytokines after pathogenic
CD4+ T cell transfer under stress condition
Because the clinical symptoms were quite different between mice having pathogenic CD4+ T cell
transfer with or without stress, we hypothesized that the positions of the vessels in the CNS where
pathogenic CD4+ T cells initially accumulated were different. Donor pathogenic CD4+ T cells and
MHC class II+ cells first accumulate at the L5 cord within 5 days after pathogenic CD4+ T cell trans-
fer via the gravity-gateway reflex as described previously (Arima et al., 2012; Sabharwal et al.,
2014) (Figure 3A). In the present work, chronic stress caused pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC
class II+ cells to accumulate at specific vessels of the boundary region of the third ventricle region,
thalamus, and dentate gyrus, but not in the L5 cord (Figure 3B). These data suggested that the L5
cord vessels are no longer used as a gateway for immune cells toward the CNS under chronic stress
conditions. Furthermore, EAE mice under stress had no paralyzed tail, uneven gait, or paralyzed rear
leg, which are all normally observed in EAE mice without stress. These data are consistent with the
L5 cord vessels not acting as a gateway for immune cells under chronic stress conditions. We also
found that pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class II+ cells accumulated comparably at the brain
specific vessels redardless of lansoprazol treatment, which suppressed gastrointestine dysregulation
(see Fiugre 2F), in mice with pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress condition (Figure 3—fig-
ure supplement 1A, B and C). These data suggested that chronic stress changes the position of the
gateway for immune cells from L5 cord vessels to brain specific vessels, while pathogenic CD4+ T
cells are activated and acculumated at the specific vessels even after lansoprazol treatment. In addi-
tion, we showed that lansoprazol treatment did not affect the accumulation of immune cells in L5
and EAE symptoms in mice without stress (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), confirming that lanso-
prazol has no or minimun affect on pathogenic T cells. All these data suggested that lansoprazol
treatment does not affect the EAE induction and that the stress-gateway reflex alters the gateway of
pathogenic CD4+ T cells. Flow cytometry analysis confirmed an abundance of immune cell accumula-
tion including pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells in the hippocampus and
interbrain area, where the specific vessels were localized (Figure 3C). Td-tomato labeling of micro-
glia cells, which we used previously (Arima et al., 2015), revealed that MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells
originated from the peripheral organs rather than resident microglia cells (Figure 3D), suggesting
that the MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells that accumulated at the specific vessels were activated
monocytes from the peripheral organs. Moreover, we found that various immune cells, including
CD8+ T cells, B cells, NK cells, and neutrophils, had also accumulated at the specific vessels (Fig-
ure 3—figure supplement 2). Thus, the stress condition induced brain micro-inflammation at spe-
cific vessels of the boundary area of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus in the
transfer EAE model.
We next sought to identify the chemokine(s) responsible for the immune cell accumulation at the
brain micro-inflammation and tested several neutralizing antibodies against chemokines particularly
known to recruit CD4+ T cells and MHC class II+ antigen presenting cells, because the activation of
pathogenic CD4+ T cells in the affected sites are critical for inflammation in transfer EAE. Blockade
of CCL5, but not chemokines including CCL2, CX3CL1, significantly suppressed the accumulation of
pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells at the specific vessels (Figure 4A and B
and Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and reduced clinical scores and mortality (Figure 4C). Interest-
ingly, the stress condition even without pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer induced CCL5 expression at

 the specific blood vessels, but acute stress models did not. (Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supple-
ment 2). These data suggest that chronic stress but not acute stress is capable to induce the nerve
activation in PVN that elicits CCL5 expression at the specific vessels.
Moreover, neutralization of the Th1 cytokine, interferon-gamma (IFN-g), or that of the Th17 cyto-
kine, IL-17A, also inhibited the brain micro-inflammation at the specific vessels (Figure 4E). Impor-
tantly, the accumulation of IL-17A- or IFN-g-deficient pathogenic CD4+ T cells was significantly
reduced at the specific blood vessels under stress conditions and resulted in less mortality (Fig-
ure 4—figure supplement 3). These data suggested that both IFN-g and IL-17A from pathogenic
CD4+ T cells are necessary for the accumulation at specific vessels and the severe phenotypes. Con-
sistent with these results, prominent inhibitory effects on the disease development were observed
with combined neutralization of IL-17A and IFN-g(Figure 4F). These results suggested that stress-
mediated CCL5 expression at the specific vessels induces the accumulation of pathogenic CD4+ T
cells, particularly Th17 and Th1 cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells to establish brain micro-inflam-
mation, which is critical for the development of fatal gastrointestinal failure. We call this phenome-
non the stress-gateway reflex.
Brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels is sufficient to induce fatal
gastrointestinal failure under stress condition
We next investigated whether brain micro-inflammation at the specific vessels is sufficient to develop
intestinal failure in mice under stress. To answer this question, we directly microinjected pathogenic
CD4+ T cells plus MOG-pulsed DC or inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-g plus IL-17A or IL-6 plus
IL-17A, either of which is known to be expressed by pathogenic CD4+ T cells and enhance chemo-
kine expression at specific vessels in gateway reflexes previously identified (Arima et al., 2012;
Sabharwal et al., 2014), at specific vessels of the boundary region of the third ventricle region, thal-
amus, and dentate gyrus under stress condition. We found that brain micro-inflammation induced by
these treatments developed severe gastrointestinal failure and affected mortality (Figure 4G). Fur-
thermore, we investigated the mortality of mice with microinjections of cytokines at the specific ves-
sels under stress condition in the presence or absence of anti-CCL5 antibody treatment and found
anti-CCL5 antibody treatment had no significant effect (Figure 4—figure supplement 4). This result
suggested that CCL5 mainly contributes to the accumulation of immune cells including pathogenic
CD4+ T cells at the specific vessels, while the effect of cytokine injection is CCL5-independent.
These results suggest that brain micro-inflammation at the specific vessels, which is triggered by

 CCL5-mediated pathogenic CD4+ T cell accumulation, induces regional cytokine increment followed
by severe gastrointestinal failure under stress condition.
The PVN-meditated sympathetic pathway is involved in the
development of brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels under
stress condition
We next investigated how pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress condition establishes the ini-
tial gateway for immune cells at specific vessels of the boundary area of the third ventricle region,
thalamus, and dentate gyrus. We previously found that the gateway reflexes are dependent on sym-
pathetic/noradrenergic pathways distributed at the target vessels (Arima et al., 2012, 2015) and
presently found that stress conditions increased sympathetic tone and serum aldosterone and corti-
sol levels (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B). Therefore, we performed chemical sympathec-
tomy at the specific vessels. Microinjection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) at the specific vessels
successfully depleted tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)+ sympathetic neurons and phospho-CREB signals
that were induced by noradrenergic receptor signaling after sympathetic activation (Figure 5—fig-
ure supplement 1). 6-OHDA-mediated chemical sympathectomy suppressed immune cell accumula-
tion at the specific vessels and the development of fatal gastrointestinal failure in mice that received
pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress condition (Figure 5A–5B).
We then investigated how sympathetic activation at the specific vessels under stress condition is
regulated. It is reported that PVN neurons include TH+ neurons are activated by several stresses,
especially chronic ones (Herman and Cullinan, 1997; Ramot et al., 2017; Shi et al., 2013; Ulrich-
Lai and Herman, 2009). Consistent with these results, we found that PVN TH+ neurons were specifi-
cally activated by stress condition even without EAE induction (Figure 5C). Moreover, the activation
of PVN neurons, particularly THneg neurons, was enhanced in mice with pathogenic CD4+ T cell
transfer under stress condition (Figure 5C), suggesting the crosstalk between microinflammation at
the specifc vessels and PVN. We further examined whether there is a direct neural connection
between the specific vessels and the PVN. We found that injection of a retrograde neural tracer,
cholera toxin B (CTB), at specific vessels of the boundary area of third ventricle region, thalamus,
and dentate gyrus reached the PVN (Figure 5D). In addition, TH+ neurons at the PVN co-expressed
noradrenaline transporter, but not dopamine transporter (Figure 5—figure supplement 2), suggest-
ing that they secrete noradrenaline at the specific vessels, which we have shown to be important for
chemokine induction (Arima et al., 2012, 2015; Sabharwal et al., 2014). These results demon-
strated that the PVN-sympathetic pathway is involved in the regional brain micro-inflammation and
severe intestinal failure.

 Brain micro-inflammation at the vessels under stress condition enhances
activation of DMH neurons and develops severe gastrointestinal failure
We next searched for neural projections from the vessels of the boundary area of the third ventricle
region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus. We found that an anterograde tracer, PHA-L, injected at these
vessels mainly reached the DMH and to a lesser degree the PVN (Figure 5E). Consistent with this
result, CTB injection at the DMH region reached the specific vessels (Figure 5F). Importantly, DMH
neurons, particularly THneg ones, were highly activated after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under
stress condition (Figure 5C). These results suggested that regional brain micro-inflammation acti-
vates neurons mainly distributed in the DMH. Based on this finding, we propose that the brain
micro-inflammation acts as a switch to establish new neural pathways including DMH that regulate
gastrointestinal homeostasis under stress conditions.
Consistent with this notion, the injection of pathogenic CD4+ T cells plus MOG-pulsed DC or IL-
17A plus IFN-g cytokines at the specific vessels under stress condition enhanced neural activation of
the PVN and DMH (Figure 5G). Furthermore, the ablation of PVN and DMH sites significantly inhib-
ited brain micro-inflammation, gastrointestinal disease and mortality (Figure 5H). It is reported that
the activation of DMH neurons is suppressed by GABA-A receptor activation (Rusyniak et al.,
2008). Muscimol, GABA-A receptor agonist, injection at DMH suppressed gastrointestinal disease
and mortality (Figure 5I). All these results suggested that DMH activation following the microinflam-
mation at the specific vessels is critical for the development of fatal gastrointestinal disease.

 ATP induced at the sites of brain micro-inflammation activates the DMH
and severe gastrointestinal failure
ATP is a neurotransmitter and is expressed in several cells after cytokine stimulation (Burn-
stock, 2006). We found that the expression of ATP was enhanced after IL-17A plus IL-6 stimulation
in endothelial cells in vitro (Figure 6A). Neurons in the DMH were highly activated by the microinjec-
tion of ATP at the specific vessels under stress condition (Figure 5G). Moreover, blockade of the
ATP receptor, P2RX7, at the specific vessels by A438079, a selective antagonist, suppressed the neu-
ral activation and fatal gastrointestinal failure (Figure 6B and C). Thus, these results suggested that
ATP is downstream of cytokine stimulation and acts as a neural stimulator. Moreover, we performed
immunohistochemical staining results. Neurons (Neurofilament L-positive cells) around the specific
vessels expressed P2RX7 and after cytokine or ATP stimulation, neurons in the DMH region also
showed NFATc1 activation (Figure 6—figure supplement 1), which is a downstream signaling com-
ponent of P2RX7 (Grol et al., 2013). Thus, we suggested that ATP can be sensed by neurons that
connect specific vessels to the DMH region in a manner dependent on P2RX7 expression. In combi-
nation with other data in this paper, we propose the following pathogenic pathway: CCL5 (from
endothelial cells at the specific vessels)fi IFN-g/IL-17A/IL-6 (from pathogenic CD4+ T cells) fi ATP
(from endothelial cells at the specific vessels)fi neural activation in the DMH region. These results
suggest that ATP at the sites of brain micro-inflammation activates the DMH to cause severe gastro-
intestinal failure.
Enhanced activation of the vagal nerve is critical for the development
of fatal gastrointestinal failure under stress condition
We next investigated whether vagal nerve activation is involved in the development of the severe
gastrointestinal failure triggered by brain micro-inflammation, because (i) the status of PVN neurons
affects the homeostasis of gastrointestinal organs via branches of the vagal nerves (Ferguson et al.,
1988) and (ii) the DMH is connected to the vagal neurons at the dorsal motor vagal nucleus (DMX),
where the nucleus of the vagal nerves are present (Thompson et al., 1996). We hypothesized that

 activation of the DMH and PVN enhances the activation of vagal neurons distributed in the stomach
and upper level of the intestines. PHA-L after injection at the DMH reached the DMX as described
(Figure 7—figure supplement 1). Moreover, we found that the DMX is highly activated after the
injection of pathogenic CD4+ T cells with MOG-pulsed DC at the vessels of the boundary area of
the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus under stress condition (Figure 7A). In addi-
tion, we found that Nucleus of the Tractus Solitaries (NTS), which is the main nucleus of afferent
vagus nerves, was activated (Figure 7A), suggesting that afferent neuronal activation is induced by
severe gastrointestinal failure, most likely in a manner dependent on micro-inflammation-related
ATP in gastrointestinal regions. Finally, we found that vagotomy suppressed gastrointestinal failure
and mortality in EAE mice under stress (Figure 7B). These results suggest that severe gastrointesti-
nal failure is induced by enhanced neural activation via the DMH-vagal axis, which is activated by
brain micro-inflammation at the specific vessels under stress.

 Discussion
We here showed that brain micro-inflammation at the boundary area of the third ventricle region,
thalamus, and dentate gyrus develops severe gastrointestinal failure via the DMH-vagal pathway in a
transfer EAE model under stress. We have reported that pathogenic CD4+ T cells transverse toward
the central nervous system (CNS) through a gateway at the dorsal vessels of the fifth lumbar (L5) spi-
nal cord in steady state in response to gravity-mediated chemokine expression via regional sympa-
thetic activation, a phenomenon we call the gravity-gateway reflex (Arima et al., 2012). During the
gravity-gateway reflex, we found that artificial electric stimulations in different muscles, which mimic
specific sensory-sympathetic crosstalk, establsihes the immune cell gateways at different regions of
the dorsal vessels of spinal cord, a phenomenon we call the electric-gateway reflex (Arima et al.,
2012). We also found that pain induces sympathetic-mediated alterations in ventral vessels of the
spinal cord to establish gateways to cause EAE relapse, a phenomenon we call the pain-gateway
reflex (Arima et al., 2015). In the present study, we show that, under stress condition, a gateway
forms at the vessels of boundary area of third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus, which
we describe as the stress-gateway reflex.
We found immune cell accumulation at the specific vessels of brain but not in L5 cord in mice
after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer under stress (Figure 3A and B), although we previously
showed that the L5-gateway is established by specific neural activation via gravity-mediated soleus
stimulation (Arima et al., 2012). It is important to know how was the gateway of immune cells at the
L5 cord disappeared? Because we found that mice with stress show reduced movement and often
lie down, we hypothesize they would have reduced stimulation of the soleus muscles, which are the
main anti-gravity muscles. The sensory neurons from soleus muscles connect to L5 dorsal root gan-
glions (DRG), which are activated by anti-gravity responses of the soleus muscles in wild type mice.
Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that mice with stress reduce L5 DRG activation and che-
mokine expression from L5 dorsal vessels (Figure 3—figure supplement 3). Thus, it is possible that
stress condition reduces anti-gravity-mediated soleus stimulation followed by closing the L5 gateway
of immune cells.
In our previous work, we identified CX3CL1 as a key chemokine for the accumulation of activated
monocytes at L5 ventral vessels and EAE relapse after pain induction in EAE-recovered mice
(Arima et al., 2015). In detail, the transfer EAE shows transient clinical symptoms. We called EAE
mice that stopped showing clinical symptoms EAE-recovered mice. There is no relapse in EAE-recov-
ered mice under normal condition. On the other hand, over 90% of MS patients experience relapse,
and there are reports showing that the occurrence of pain is associated with neurologic symptoms
and disease severity in patients with MS (Ehde et al., 2003, 2006; O’Connor et al., 2008). We
therefore hypothesized that pain sensation might induce MS relapse via a reflex pathway. Indeed,
pain sensation induced EAE relapse in EAE-recovered mice. Mechanistic analysis showed that the
CNS conditions between wild type and EAE-recovered mice are completely different even though
both groups show no clinical symptoms. In the EAE-recovered mice, many MHC class IIhiCX3CR1
+CD11b+ cells are found in the CNS particulalry in L5 level. These cells are not activated microglial
cells but activated monocytes coming from the periphery. The identification of the periphery as the
source of MHC class IIhiCX3CR1+CD11b+ cells was done by two methods: parabiosis and labeling
microglial cells with CX3CR1-Tdtomato. Importantly, these activated monocytes in the CNS of EAE-

 recovered mice stayed for a long time (over 150 days in some cases) after pathogenic CD4+ T cell
transfer and are critical for the development of pain-mediated EAE relapse (Arima et al., 2015),
eLife). On the other hand, many papers have recently reported resident T cells stay in non-immune
tissues for a very long time (over 150 days in some cases) after the initial immune response in the tis-
sues and affect subsequent immune responses (Iijima and Iwasaki, 2014; Mueller and Mackay,
2016). The characteristics of these resident T cells and our activated monocytes in the CNS of the
EAE-recovered mice are quite similar: (1) infiltrate the initially affected non-immune tissues, (2) infil-
trate a long time, and (3) influence subsequent immune responses. Therefore, we describe the acti-
vated monocytes in the CNS of EAE-recovered mice as resident monocytes.
Resident monocytes with CX3CR1 in EAE-recovered mice accumulate from the periphery to stay
in the CNS for a long time and contribute to the development of pain-mediated EAE-relapse. There-
fore, it is possible that the origin of the resident monocytes could be patrolling monocytes with
CX3CR1 in blood stream. We previously showed that resident monocytes with CX3CR1 express
CX3CL1 after stimulation with norepinephrine, which is produced around the ventral vessels of the
spinal cord following activation of the pain-specific neural pathway (Arima et al., 2015). These
results suggested a CX3CR1-CX3CL1 autocrine loop in the resident monocytes that is regulated by
norepinephrine. A major distinction between the previous and the current study is that in the previ-
ous study the activated monocytes were already presented in the CNS as CNS-resident activated
monocytes with autoantigen presentation abilityand high CX3CR1 expression in EAE-recovered
mice. The CNS-resident activated monocytes were infiltrated the CNS during the initial phase of
EAE. The pain-specific neural pathway then induced the accumulation of these CNS-resident acti-
vated monocytes at the L5 ventral vessels, which is where norepinephrine was produced via the
pain-specific sympathetic pathway, followed by EAE relapse and the accumulation of other immune
cells including pathogenic CD4+ T cells from the blood stream. However, in the current study, there
are no CNS-resident activated monocytes in wild type mice under stress. Therefore, CX3CL1, which
is a critical chemokine for CNS-resident monocytes, is not critical for the stress-gateway reflex in this
study. On the other hand, during the stress-gateway reflex, we recognized CCL5 is required for the
recruitment of pathogenic CD4+ T cells, including Th1 and Th17 cells, to the specific vessels from
the periphery to trigger micro-inflammation and stimulate the subsequent recruitment of MHC class
IIhiCD11b+ cells. (These MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells are possibly similar or the same cell types as
the activated monocytes in the pain-gateway reflex, although majority of activated monocytes from
the periphery initially express low CX3CR1 in the CNS). We assume that the recruitment of MHC
class IIhiCD11b+ cells may be at least partially dependent on CX3CL1 from endotheial cells, which is
induced by cytokines from pathogenic CD4+ T cells that accumulated at the specific vessels in
response to CCL5. The cytokines IFN-g, IL-17A, and IL-6, which are likely secreted by the pathogenic
CD4+ T cells, are also important for the development of this micro-inflammation and the resulting
severe gastrointestinal failure. Indeed, both the accumulation of CD4+ T cells and MHC class
IIhiCD11b+ cells at the specific vessels as well as the severe gastrointestinal failure were suppressed
by blockade of CCL5 or IL-17A and IFN-g. Additionally, IL-17A- or IFN-g-deficient pathogenic CD4+
T cells did not accumulate at the specific vessels even under stress. We hypothesized the BBB
breaching at the specific vessels depends on antigen-presenting events on pathogenic CD4+ T cells.
In agreement, we found that MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells had the ability to activate pathogenic CD4
+ T cells without exogenous MOG peptide (Figure 4—figure supplement 5), suggesting that MHC
class IIhiCD11b+ cells have autoantigen-presentation ability. We theorize that the chemokine/cyto-
kine expression and the accumulation of MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells as well as pathogenic CD4+ T
cells at specific vessels could be used to diagnose and/or therapeutically target several types of
severe gastrointestinal failure in patients.
We found that the development of fatal gastrointestinal failure depended on activation of a previ-
ously unidentified DMH-vagal nerve pathway, which was triggered by ATP from the brain micro-
inflammation sites. We here found that this nerve pathway was hardly activated under steady state
or stress conditions without brain micro-inflammation. Thus, ATP at the specific vessels can be
viewed as a switch that activates this new neural pathway. At the same time, the brain micro-inflam-
mation is triggered by PVN-mediated TH+ sympathetic activation in the presence of pathogenic
CD4+ T cells in the blood. Emotional responses can activate specific nuclei in emotional centers that
contain TH+ noradrenergic neurons. We found TH+ noradrenergic neurons connected the PVN with
the specific vessels localized at the boundary area of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and

 dentate gyrus. There exist TH+ noradrenergic neuronal pathways that connect other nuclei to some
specific vessels in the brain. For example, it is reported that cerebral microvessels have noradrener-
gic innervation from the locus coeruleus (Harik, 1986; Kalaria et al., 1989). Our results therefore
may indicate that brain micro-inflammation at some specific vessels could activate unidentified neu-
ral pathways to regulate the homeostasis of various organs including brain itself.
The brain-gut axis involves several neural components, including (1) the autonomic nervous sys-
tem, (2) the CNS, (3) the stress system such as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and (4) the
corticotropin-releasing factor system, along with the intestinal response (Caso et al., 2008). Regard-
ing connection between (1) the autonomic nervous system and (2) the CNS, we showed that the
stress condition activates PVN noradrenagic/sympathetic neurons connected to vessels localized at
the boundary area of the third ventricle region, thalamus, and dentate gyrus. This activation is impor-
tant for the accumulation of pathogenic CD4+ T cells and MHC class IIhiCD11b+ cells. Regarding
connection between (2) the CNS and (3) the stress system, the enhanced activation of the neurons in
the PVN/DMH regions by the brain micro-inflammation and stress activated DMX/vagal nerves
(Figure 7C). During this process, (4) the corticotropin-releasing factor system was also activated, as
indicated by the high corticosteroid levels in the serum of mice even without pathogenic CD4+ T
cell transfer. Importantly, we found that gastrointestinal diseases after microinjection of cytokines in
mice with stress were not suppressed by two antagonists of the corticosteroid receptor such as
mifepristone and guggulsterone (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Thus, regarding the gastrointesti-
nal response, the resulting vagal nerve activation induced severe gastrointestinal failure, although
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis has a minimum role in the development of micro inflamma-
tion-mediated gastrointestinal diseases under stress.
How is the linkage between pathogenic CD4+ T cells and activation of p38 in stomach? It is
known that pathogenic CD4+ T cells for the transfer EAE express cytokines including IFN-g, IL-17A,
and IL-6 (Langrish et al., 2005), and very strong stress alone induces gastric disease via p38 activa-
tion at the affected tissues by the activation of the vagal pathway (Debas and Carvajal, 1994;
Jia et al., 2007; Uwada et al., 2017). We showed that the injection of IFN-g, IL-17A, and IL-6 or
ATP at specific vessels in the brain of mice with relatively low stress establishes a neural pathway via
DMH and DMX (nucleus of vagal nerves) followed by the development of fatal gastrointestinal dis-
eases (Figures 4G and 5G) and the activation of p38 in stomach (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).
Moreover, cytokine stimulation in endothelial cells causes the expression of ATP (Figure 6A). These
results strongly suggested that cytokines from pathogenic CD4+ T cells act on endothelial cells at
the specific vessels and induce ATP around the specific vessels. The resulting ATP activates the
DMH-vagal axis, which is important for the development of gastrointestinal diseases as well as the
activation of p38. Therefore, cytokines from the pathogenic CD4+ T cells are a triggering factor to
activate p38 in the affected GI tract tissues via DMH-vagal axis activation in mice with relatively low-
stress.

Sadovnick et al., 1989). Interestingly, primary progressive MS is dominant in patients who suffered
from bowel dysfunction (Preziosi et al., 2013), suggesting that transfer EAE under stress condition
could model progressive MS. Complications of celiac disease, epilepsy and cerebral calcifications
are also known to be associated with MS (Gobbi, 2005; Gobbi et al., 1992). Therefore, our model
may provide a possible explanation for several brain-intestine comorbidities during brain diseases
including MS.

vessels, which is most likely triggerred by autoreactive CD4+ T cells, could activate new neural path-
ways to cause dysfunction in the brain neural network and/or in certain organs in the periphery. It is
reported that the prevalence of dementia is considerably higher in elder people with gastritis and

 psychological disorders is associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) (Momtaz et al., 2014),
which supports our hypothesis.
Sensitivity to chronic stress in humans is diverse owing to genetic factors and/or environmental
factors such as stressful events in early life when the brain is particularly sensitive to stress
(Lupien et al., 2009; Mayer, 2000). Indeed, it is reported that early life stress such as abuse or poor
care plays a role in the susceptibility to develop behavior problems and gastrointestinal diseases
(Lupien et al., 2009; Mayer, 2000). The early life period is also important for the establishment of T
cell repertoire and central tolerance, and it is known that thymocytes are very sensitive to glucocorti-
coid that can be induced by stress (Ashwell et al., 2000; Hogquist et al., 2005). Therefore, it is
tempting to speculate that individual variations to respond to stress might also be defined by the
presence of autoreactive CD4+ T cells to the CNS autoantigens, and that measurement of the autor-
eactive CD4+ T cell population in the peripheral blood might predict the susceptibility to develop
peripheral organ failure by chronic stress. Genetic associations of certain MHC class II alleles with
diseases including dementia and neurodegenerative diseases etc that involve brain micro-inflamma-
tion described above support our hypothesis (Ferrari et al., 2014; Nalls et al., 2014).
In summary, we demonstrated a molecular mechanism of the brain-gut axis by using a brain auto-
immune-inflammation model under stress condition. Our findings provide molecular insight on how
brain micro-inflammation at specific vessels develops fatal gastrointestinal failure. Because there are
afferent and efferent neural systems in whole body, it could be possible that dysregulations in the
peripheral organs including not only gastrointestine and heart but also other organs might also
affect the status or region of micro-inflammation in the brain. We propose that local brain micro-
inflammation is induced by stress-mediated PVN activation to enhance the activation of a new neural
pathway, the DMH-vagal nerve pathway, to aggravate gastrointestinal failure.
Materials and methods
Mouse strains
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Tokyo, Japan). C57BL/6-PL mice were purchased
from Taconic (Germantown, NY). In addition, C57BL/6-Tg (Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2)1Kuch/J (Bettelli et al.,
2003), IL-17A-deficient mice (Nakae et al., 2002) and B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J (Dalton et al., 1993)
were used in this study. There are no sample exclusion criteria. Sample size of more than three mice
was chosen to ensure power for statistical tests unless the availability of mice was limited. All mice
were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions according to the protocols of Hokkaido
University. The animal experiments used in this study were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committees of Hokkaido University (Approval number: 14–0083).
Passive transfer of pathogenic CD4+ T cells from mice to induce EAE
EAE induction was performed as described previously (Arima et al., 2012, 2015; Ogura et al.,
2008). Briefly, C57BL/6 mice were injected with a MOG(35-55) peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo) in
complete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich) at the base of the tail on day 0 followed by intravenous
injection of pertussis toxin (Sigma-Aldrich) on days 0, 2, and 7. On day 9, CD4+ T cells from the
resulting mice were sorted using anti-CD4 microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Tokyo). The resulting CD4+
T cell-enriched population (4 � 106 cells) was cocultured with rIL-23 (10 ng/ml; R&D Systems, Minne-
apolis, MN) in the presence of MOG peptide-pulsed irradiated splenocytes (1 � 107 cells) for 2 days.
Anti-CD4 microbeads were used to enrich CD4+ T cells. These pathogenic CD4+ T cells (1.5 � 107
cells) were then injected intravenously into wild type mice. Clinical scores were measured as
described previously (Arima et al., 2012, 2015; Ogura et al., 2008). As examples of non-CNS anti-
gens, OVA(323-339) peptide (Sigma-Aldrich, Tokyo) and human IRBP (1-20) peptide (Sigma-Aldrich,
Tokyo) were used. Except for the peptides, OVA- and IRBP-specific CD4+ T cells were generated
and transferred in the same way as MOG-pathogenic CD4+ T cells.
Fecal occult blood test
Stool samples were collected from each mouse and dissolved in saline. After centrifugation (8000
rpm, 5 min), the supernatant was collected and diluted tenfold with saline. The fecal occult blood
test was performed with hemastix (SIEMENS, Germany).

 Psychophysiological stress-induced sleep disorder model
6–8 week-old C57BL/6 mice were individually maintained in plastic cages with running wheels for
habituation. After that, the mice were exposed to psychophysiological stress to induce sleep disor-
der (SD) (Miyazaki et al., 2013; Oishi et al., 2014). Briefly, paper-chip bedding was replaced with
water to a depth of 1.5 cm, which caused the mice to run on the wheel all day. After 2 days of SD,
the mice received pathogenic CD4+ T cells intravenously.
Wet bedding stress model
6–8 week-old C57BL/6 mice were put in damp bedding (350 ml water in a cage), which was changed
daily. After 2 days of stress treatment, the mice were injected i.v. with pathogenic CD4+ T cells.
Measurement of potassium levels
Potassium levels in plasma were determined using Fuji Dri-Chem 7000 (FUJIFILM, Japan).
ATP assay
A type 1 collagen+ endothelial BC1 cell line was obtained from Dr. M. Miyasaka (Osaka University).
For stimulation, BC1 cells were plated in 96-well plates (1 � 104 cells/well) and stimulated with
human IL-6 (50 ng/ml; Toray Industries) plus human soluble IL-6 receptor a (50 ng/ml; R&D Systems),
mouse IL-17A (50 ng/ml; R&D Systems). ATP was determined with a luciferin-luciferase assay using
an ATP assay kit (TOYO Ink, Tokyo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Multiplex assay
Cortisol levels in serum were determined using a milliplex kit from Merck Millipore (Tokyo)
Measurement of aldosterone levels
Aldosterone levels in serum were determined using a ELISA kit from ENDOCRINE (USA).
Western Blotting
Gastric mucosa samples were homogenized in protein lysis/sample buffer (RIPA buffer: 50 mM
Tris, pH8.0, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, 1
mM PMSF) containing a protease inhibitor and proteasome inhibitor and centrifuged (15,000 rpm,
20 min), and the resultant supernatants used as protein lysates. The concentration of protein was
measured with protein assay kit (Bio-rad, USA) followed by SDS-PAGE (Wako, Tokyo, Japan). After
transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, immunoblotting was performed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Cell Signaling Technology).
Cardiac electrocardiogram system
A telemetry transmitter (TA11ETA-F10; Data Science International, USA/Primetech Corporation,
Tokyo) was implanted subcutaneously into the flank of the body. Electrocardiograph (ECG) electro-
des were fixed on both side of the chest. The monitoring was performed according to the manufac-
turer’s protocol by using Dataquest A,R,T Acquisition (Primetech Corporation, Tokyo). Analysis was
performed with Dataquest A,R,T Analysis (Primetech Corporation, Tokyo).
Measurement of hematocrit levels
Blood was collected in heparinized microhematocrit capillary tubes and centrifuged for 5 min at
12,000 rpm. After that, the percentage of hematocrit was determined with a hematocrit reader from
KUBOTA (Tokyo).
Histological analysis
Brain was harvested, embedded in SCEM compound (SECTION-LAB Co. Ltd., Hiroshima, Japan),
and prepared as sections using the microtome device CM3050 (Leica Microsystems, Tokyo) with Cry-
ofilm type IIIC (16UF) from SECTION-LAB Co. Ltd (Tokyo). The resulting sections were stained with
hematoxylin/eosin or immunohistochemical staining and analyzed with a BZ-9000 microscope (KEY-
ENCE, Osaka, Japan). Analysis was performed by HS ALL software in BZ-II analyzer (KEYENCE). Fro-
zen sections (10 mm) were prepared according to a published method (Arima et al., 2012;
Kawamoto, 2003).

Tamoxifen, Muscimol, ATP, Mifepristone and guggulsterone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
PHA-L was purchased from VECTOR. A438079 was purchased from TOCRIS Bioscience (Minneapo-
lis, MN).
Flow cytometry
To generate single cell suspensions, brains or retina were dissected after cardiac perfusion and enzy-
matically digested using the Neural Tissue Dissection Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) or collagenase D (Basel,
Switzerland), and 106 cells were incubated with fluorescence-conjugated antibodies for 30 min on
ice for cell surface labeling. The cells were then analyzed with cyan flow cytometers (Beckman Coul-
ter, Tokyo). The collected data were analyzed using Summit software (Beckman Coulter) and/or
Flowjo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously with slight modifications (Lee et al.,
2012).
Laser micro-dissection
Approximately 100 frozen sections (15 mm/section) were fixed with PAXgene (QIAGEN, Tokyo) for
15 min followed by 100% EtOH for 10 min. Tissues around the third ventricle vessels in the sections
were collected by a laser micro-dissection device, DM6000B (Leica Microsystems), and total RNA

 was extracted by the RNeasy micro Kit (QIAGEN). After DNase treatment and reverse transcription,
cDNA was subjected to real-time qPCR analysis.
Real-time PCRs
The GeneAmp 5700 sequence detection system (ABI, Tokyo) and KAPA PROBE FAST ABI Prism
qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems, Boston, MA) were used to quantify the levels of HPRT mRNA and CCL5
mRNA. The PCR primer pairs used for real-time PCRs with the KAPA PROBE FAST ABI Prism qPCR
Kit were as follows: mouse Hprt primers, 5’-AGCCCCAAAATGGTTAAGGTTG �3’ and 5’-
CAAGGGCATATCCAACAACAAAC-3’, probe, 5’-ATCCAACAAAGTCTGGCCTGTATCCAACAC-3’;

5’-CCTTCTCCAGCATGGGCTC-3’
and
5’-CG
TGGGGATAAAGTTGGCACTA-3’, probe, 5’-TGTCAACACACAGGACTTTTGCGCAGAT-3’. The con-
ditions for real-time PCR were 40 cycles at 95˚C for 3 s followed by 40 cycles at 60˚C for 30 s. The
relative mRNA expression levels were normalized to the levels of HPRT mRNA.
Treatments of antibodies and reagents
In some experiments, anti-IFN-g antibody (100 mg/mouse), anti-IL-17A antibody (100 mg/mouse),
anti-CCL2 antibody (100 mg/mouse), anti-CX3CL1 antibody (100 mg/mouse) or anti-CCL5 antibody
(100 mg/mouse) were intraperitoneally injected everyday after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer. Lan-
soprazol (30 mg/kg) was treated orally everyday after pathogenic CD4+ T cell transfer.
Brain microinjection
The head of an anesthetized mouse was placed in a stereotaxic device. Fur above the skull was
shaved, and the skin was cleaned with 70% ethanol. A 30-gauge needle was lowered toward the
third ventricle vessels (AP �1.06 mm; ML 1 mm; DV 2.25 mm), PVN (AP �1.06 mm; ML 0.25 mm; DV
4.8 mm), and DMH (AP �1.46 mm; ML 0.37 mm; DV 5 mm), and 6-OHDA, FITC-CTB, PHA-L, Musci-
mol (2 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml, 25 mg/ml, 0.25 mg/ml, respectively, 0.2 ml each delivered over 90 s) were
injected as described previously (Kim et al., 2011). Pathogenic CD4+ T cells (1 � 106 cells) plus
MOG-pulsed BMDC (5 � 105 cells) were injected around the third ventricle vessels by the same pro-
tocol. IL-6 (50 ng; Toray) + IL-17A (50 ng; R&D Systems), IFN-g (50 ng; PeproTech, Tokyo) + IL-17A
(50 ng), gATP (2 mg), and A438079 (1 mg) were injected around the third ventricle vessels by the
same protocol. Mifepristone (30 mg/kg; Sigma), guggulsterone (30 mg/kg; Sigma) were intraperito-
neally injected everyday after cytokine injection.
Surgical procedures
Anesthetized mice were placed in a stereotactic frame, and a hole was drilled through the skull. An
electrode (Brain Science Idea, Tokyo) was inserted through the skull at the level of the PVN (AP
�1.06 mm; ML 0.25 mm; DV 4.8 mm), and a direct current of 400 uA was applied for 5 s.
Subdiaphragmatic vagotomy
The stomach and lower esophagus were visualized from an upper midline laparotomy. The stomach
was gently retracted down beneath the diaphragm to clearly expose both vagal trunks. At least 1
mm of visible vagal nerve was dissected. In addition, all neural and connective tissue surrounding
the esophagus immediately below the diaphragm was removed to transect all small vagal branches.
Immobilization stress
EAE-recovered mice were subjected to immobilization stress in a plastic tube for 30 min/day over 2
days (Yoshihara and Yawaka, 2013).
Antigen presentation assay
Naı
¨ve CD4+ T cells from 2D2 mice and CD11b+ cells from SD+T cells+ mice were sorted using a cell
sorter (MoFlo, Beckman) and anti-CD11b microbeads, respectively (Miltenyi Biotec). The resulting
CD4+ T cell-enriched population (1 � 105 cells) was cocultured with the isolated CD11b+ cells

 (5 � 104 cells or 1 � 105 cells) without MOG-peptide addition in a 96 well plate for 2 days. IL-2 levels
in cell culture supernatants were determined using ELISA kits (eBioscience).
Statistical analysis
Student’s t tests (two-tailed) and ANOVA tests were used for the statistical analysis of differences
between two groups and that of differences between more than two groups, respectively. P values
less than 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
