INTRODUCTION 
 
Skeletal muscle is critical to physical function, health, 
and quality of life throughout the lifespan, but muscle 
mass and strength are clearly compromised in older 
adults [1], especially after the 6th decade of life [2].  
Sarcopenia is a major factor contributing to decreased 
physical function in older adults and predictive of future 
disability [3]. Sarcopenia has multifactorial origins, and 
its negative influence on healthspan is compounded by 
other related hallmarks of aging, which include reduced 
whole-body peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) [4], 
neurodegenerative changes, increased adiposity [5, 6], 
decreased regenerative potential of the muscle stem cell 
niche [7, 8], and changes in mitochondrial physiology 
[9-12].   
Exercise is a proven therapeutic strategy to prevent and 
reverse sarcopenia and related complications [10, 13], 
with pleiotropic adaptations that include improvements 
in muscle mass and strength [14], increased muscle 
protein 
synthesis 
rates 
[15, 
16], 
mitochondrial 
proliferation [17, 18], increased oxidative capacity [10], 
and increased satellite cell content [19] in older adults. 
However, in many cases these adaptations are blunted, 
slower to occur, and more rapidly lost after exercise in 
older adults [15, 18, 20, 21].  For example, older adults 
exhibit blunted hypertrophic responses to resistance 
exercise training [22, 23] and attenuated increases in 
muscle protein synthesis in response to acute bouts of 
resistance exercise [24-26].  These observations are 
consistent with the concept of anabolic resistance with 
aging [27], which appears to be driven, in part, by 
Influence of omega-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle protein 
metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics in older adults

ABSTRACT 
 
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) are recognized for their anti-inflammatory effects and may be 
beneficial in the context of sarcopenia.  We determined the influence of n3-PUFA on muscle mitochondrial 
physiology and protein metabolism in older adults. Twelve young (18-35 years) and older (65-85 years) men 
and women were studied at baseline.  Older adults were studied again following n3-PUFA supplementation 
(3.9g/day, 16 weeks).  Muscle biopsies were used to evaluate respiratory capacity (high resolution 
respirometry) and oxidant emissions (spectrofluorometry) in isolated mitochondria.  Maximal respiration was 
significantly lower in older compared to young.  n3-PUFA did not change respiration, but significantly reduced 
oxidant emissions.  Participants performed a single bout of resistance exercise, followed by biopsies at 15 and 
18 hours post exercise.  Several genes involved in muscle protein turnover were significantly altered in older 
adults at baseline and following exercise, yet muscle protein synthesis was similar between age groups under 
both conditions. Following n3-PUFA supplementation, mixed muscle, mitochondrial, and sarcoplasmic protein 
synthesis rates were increased in older adults before exercise. n3-PUFA increased post-exercise mitochondrial 
and myofibrillar protein synthesis in older adults.  These results demonstrate that n3-PUFA reduce 
mitochondrial oxidant emissions, increase postabsorptive muscle protein synthesis, and enhance anabolic 
responses to exercise in older adults.

chronic, low grade, sterile inflammation that is often 
observed with aging [28, 29] and linked with frailty 
[30]. It is known that inflammatory cytokines such as 
tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) inhibit muscle protein 
synthesis by decreasing mRNA translation efficiency 
[31].  Furthermore TNFα expression was inversely 
related to muscle protein synthesis in frail elderly [32].  
Similarly, Toth et al. showed that postabsorptive muscle 
protein synthesis rates were 20% lower in older 
compared to young adults, and inversely related to 
circulating C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and TNFα 
receptor II [33].  Together, these studies suggest that 
inflammation may attenuate anabolic responsiveness in 
older adults.  Further support for this hypothesis comes 
from studies where inflammation was reduced using 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or omega-3 
polyunsaturated fatty acids.  These interventions 
restored protein synthesis rates with aging [34, 35] and 
enhanced muscle mass and strength gains in response to 
resistance exercise in older humans [36-38].   
 
There 
is 
also 
solid 
evidence 
linking 
chronic 
inflammation 
with 
mitochondrial 
abnormalities 
observed in aging skeletal muscle such as increased 
oxidative stress [39], and mitochondrial dysfunction due 
to reduced mitochondrial oxidative capacity [12], 
abundance [12] and mitochondrial protein expression 
[10].  Inflammatory mediators such as TNFα and IL-1β 
have been shown to induce reactive oxygen species 
(ROS) production and alter the activity of mitochondrial 
respiratory chain complexes [40].  In light of recent 
reports that dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids 
(n3-PUFA) reduce adipose tissue inflammation in 
humans [41] and repress TNFα signaling pathways in 
mice [42], we recently determined if dietary n3-PUFA 
could restore muscle mitochondrial function in aging 
mice [43].  We reported that the anti-inflammatory 
effects of eicosapentaenoic acid were associated with 
upregulated transcriptional regulators of mitochondrial 
biogenesis 
[44] 
and 
marked 
improvements 
in 
mitochondrial function in old mice [43].  It remains 
unclear whether similar nutritional strategies to suppress 
chronic inflammation in older humans will improve 
anabolic responsiveness to exercise or recapitulate the 
improvements 
in 
muscle 
mitochondrial 
function 
observed in rodents. 
 
In the current study, we sought to translate early 
observations from mice to human aging by determining 
the 
influence 
of 
dietary 
n3-PUFA 
on 
muscle 
mitochondrial physiology, skeletal muscle protein 
synthesis, and anabolic response to acute exercise in 
healthy older adults.  Twelve healthy young (18-35 
years) and older (65-85 years) men and women were 
studied at baseline.  Older adults were studied again 
following a 16-week open-label intervention of n3-
PUFA supplementation at 3.9g/day.  Skeletal muscle 
biopsies were acquired to evaluate the primary 
outcomes, which included mitochondrial respiration and 
ROS 
production, 
postabsorptive 
muscle 
protein 
synthesis rates, and the anabolic response to an acute 
bout of exercise (Figure 1). 
 
 
Figure 1.  Study design.  Study design (A) involved an initial phone screening, screening visit, outpatient testing for body 
composition and physical function, and inpatient testing of mitochondrial physiology and muscle protein metabolism.  Older adults 
repeated study visits following 16 weeks of n3-PUFA supplementation.  Inpatient study procedures (B) involved basal postabsorptive 
muscle protein synthesis measurements on Day 1 by infusing 13C6-Phenylalanine and serial muscle biopsies on the right leg.  Following 
a standardized meal, a single bout of unaccustomed resistance exercise was performed at 1600 hr using the left leg. A second tracer 
infusion began on day 2, followed by serial biopsies to assess muscle protein synthesis 15-18 hours following exercise.

RESULTS 
 
The descriptive characteristics of the young and older 
adults (pre and post n3-PUFA supplementation) are 
shown in Table 1; the biochemical and metabolic 
parameters in Table 2, and the plasma free fatty acids 
profile in Table 3. 
 
Evidence of impaired mitochondrial function in 
older adults 
 
Mitochondria were isolated from vastus lateralis muscle 
biopsies under postabsorptive conditions, and oxygen 
consumption was measured during a stepwise titration 
protocol using substrates supporting carbohydrate-based 
respiration (Figure 2A, C) or lipid-based respiration 
(Figure 2B, D).  These experiments revealed that 
oxygen consumption rates were significantly lower in 
muscle from older compared to young adults when 
expressed relative to tissue weight (Figure 2A, B) or 
relative to mitochondrial protein abundance (Figure 2C, 
D).  This 30-40% reduction in state 3 respiration was 
primarily evident when respiration was supported 
through complex I electron flow whereas there was no 
significant difference in state 3 respiration under 
conditions where respiration was supported exclusively 
through complex II.  Importantly, the age-related 
reductions in state 3 respiration persisted when oxygen 
flux was normalized to mitochondrial protein content 
(Figure 2C, D), indicating that an age-related reduction 
in mitochondrial abundance cannot completely explain 
the loss of mitochondrial oxidative capacity in older 
adults.  The data point to an intrinsic loss in 
mitochondrial capacity at the organelle level.  Despite 
significant reductions in mitochondrial respiratory 
capacity, young and older adults exhibited similar rates 
of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) emissions from isolated 
mitochondria, 
measured 
by 
fluorescence-based 
monitoring of amplex red oxidation under different 
energetic states (Figure 2E, F).  Regardless of whether 
H2O2 was expressed relative to tissue weight (Figure 
2E) or mitochondrial protein content (Figure 2F), there 
was no evidence of an increase in ROS production in 
mitochondria from older adults.

n3-PUFA do not increase mitochondrial respiration, 
but reduce mitochondrial ROS production in older 
adults 
 
Sixteen weeks of high dose (3.9g/day) n3-PUFA in 
older adults did not significantly change muscle 
mitochondrial respiration rates under any of the 
observed experimental conditions with carbohydrate-
based substrates (Figure 2A, C).  Although state 2 and 
state 
4 
respiration 
with 
lipid 
substrates 
were 
significantly lower following n3-PUFA (Figure 2B), 
these differences did not persist when normalized to 
mitochondrial protein content (Figure 2D), nor were 
there any changes in state 3 or fully uncoupled 
respiration following the intervention.  After 4 months 
of n3-PUFA consumption, there was a 20-25% 
reduction in mitochondrial H2O2 production under 
conditions where the ROS-emitting potential of 
mitochondria was highest (state 2, state 4).  This 
reduction in ROS production was evident when rates 
were expressed relative to tissue weight (Figure 2E) or 
relative to mitochondrial protein content (Figure 2F). 
The observation that normalizing to mitochondrial 
protein did not abolish the reduction in ROS production 
suggests that n3-PUFA reduce intrinsic mitochondrial 
ROS generation.  
Transcriptional 
evidence 
of 
blunted 
exercise 
responsiveness in older adults 
 
Young and older adults performed a single bout of 
unaccustomed resistance exercise (8 sets, 10 repetitions 
at 70% of 1-repetition maximum weight). Muscle 
biopsies were collected before exercise and 15 hours 
after exercise to measure the expression of selected 
canonical genes involved in muscle protein turnover by 
RT-PCR (Figure 3).  Myostatin (MSTN), a negative 
regulator of muscle growth and development, decreased 
following exercise in young, but not old adults (Figure 
3A).  Similarly, MyoD, which is a positive regulator of 
muscle differentiation in response to exercise, increased 
significantly in young following exercise, but not in old 
(Figure 3B).  TRIM63, which encodes an E3 ubiquitin 
ligase known as muscle RING Finger 1, decreased 
significantly after exercise in young but not older adults 
(Figure 3D).  Another ubiquitin ligase, FBXO32, was 
robustly increased after exercise in young but not old 
(Figure 3F).  Calpain 1 and 2, calcium-activated neutral 
proteases, were either decreased (CAPN1, Figure 3H) 
or increased (CAPN2, Figure 3I) following exercise in 
young but not old.  FOXO3, a transcription factor that 
triggers apoptosis was similarly decreased with exercise 
in young and old (Figure 3G).  Taken together, the

mRNA expression of several genes involved in 
regulating muscle protein turnover exhibit attenuated

CAPN2) consistent with a state of active turnover in 
muscle of older adults before exercise.

Although the increase in mixed muscle FSR with 
exercise did not reach statistical significance in older 
adults, we did not observe any significant differences 
when we compared the change in FSR from rest to post-
exercise in young and old (Figure 4E).  Mitochondrial 
and sarcoplasmic FSR increased significantly in older, 
but not young adults following exercise (Figure 4B, C) 
but did not differ in the change in FSR from rest to post-
exercise (Figure 4F, G).  Similar to mixed muscle FSR, 
myofibrillar FSR increased significantly after exercise 
in young but not older adults (Figure 4D), but we did 
not observe any significant differences when we 
compared the change in FSR from rest to post-exercise 
in young and old (Figure 4H).  Altogether, the baseline 
and post-exercise measurements of mixed muscle FSR 
and subcellular fractions did not reveal any age-related 
impairments in postabsorptive muscle protein synthesis 
or anabolic responsiveness. 
 
n3-PUFA increase postabsorptive protein synthesis 
and anabolic response to exercise in older adults 
 
The measurements of postabsorptive and post-exercise 
muscle protein synthesis were repeated in older adults 
following 16 weeks of daily supplementation (3.9g/day) 
of n3-PUFA.  There was a significant increase in 
postabsorptive 
mitochondrial 
(Figure 
4B) 
and 
sarcoplasmic (Figure 4C) protein synthesis in older 
adults following n3-PUFA supplementation.  Small but 
non-significant increases were also observed for mixed 
muscle (Figure 4A) and myofibrillar (Figure 4D) 
fractions in the basal condition.  After exercise, FSR of 
mitochondrial 
and 
myofibrillar 
fractions 
were 
significantly higher than postabsorptive FSR (Figure 
4B, D) with increases in MMP and sarcoplasmic 
fractions that did not reach statistical significance.  The 
exercise-induced increment in FSR in each fraction was 
compared in a pairwise manner in older adults before 
and after the n3-PUFA intervention (Figure 4 E, F, G, 
H).  There was notable heterogeneity in the response as 
indicated by the individual data points showing that 
some individuals exhibited robust increases in exercise-
stimulated

others 
demonstrated little improvement.  The exercise

4A, C).   
 
Skeletal muscle whole-transcriptome sequencing 
 
To gain mechanistic insights into the effects of aging, 
exercise and n3-PUFA on skeletal muscle function, 
next-generation sequencing was performed using RNA 
extracted from muscle biopsy specimens collected 
before exercise and 15 hours following exercise.  A 
total of 834 genes were significantly different between 
young and old at baseline in the postabsorptive state 
(Figure 5A).  Of these genes, 39 were classified as 
mitochondria-related genes (14 upregulated with age, 
25 downregulated with age).  A comparison of 
postabsorptive biopsies from old individuals before and 
after n3-PUFA intervention (Figure 5B) revealed that a 
total of 63 genes were significantly changed following 
n3-PUFA (53 upregulated following n3-PUFA, 10 
downregulated).  Of these genes, 3 were classified as 
mitochondria-related 
genes, 
all 
of 
which 
were 
downregulated by n3-PUFA.  The heatmaps contained 
in Supplemental Figures 1-6 show fold changes in 
reference to the young group in older adults before and 
after n3-PUFA supplementation for selected gene 
groups.  Genes related to oxidative phosphorylation 
(Supplemental Figure 1) and the tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle (Supplemental Figure 2) display a general 
pattern where older adults exhibit decreased abundance 
of the majority of these genes compared to young and 
further decreases following n3-PUFA.    
 
Next, we examined the genes that were significantly up- 
or downregulated in response to the single bout of 
exercise in young and older adults.  A total of 2,560 
genes were significantly changed in response to 
exercise in young participants (Figure 5C).  Of these 
genes, 97 were classified as mitochondria-related genes 
(51 upregulated and 46 downregulated with exercise).  
We manually curated a list of genes known to be 
involved in regulating muscle protein turnover of which 
we found 17 to be significantly influenced by exercise 
in young (12 upregulated, 5 downregulated). Gene 
expression fold changes with exercise in selected gene 
categories are given in Supplemental Figures 7-13 
(Oxidative 
phosphorylation, 
TCA 
cycle, 
Lipid 
oxidation, ROS production, Glycolysis, Anabolic 
response, and Inflammation).  In older adults, there 
were far fewer genes (483) significantly changed with 
exercise (Figure 5D). A total of 17 mitochondrial-
related genes were altered by exercise in older adults 
with 14 upregulated and 3 downregulated.  Only 15 
genes involved in protein turnover were changed in 
response to exercise in the older group (9 upregulated, 6 
downregulated).  Following 16 weeks of n3-PUFA 
supplementation, a similar number of genes (473) were 
significantly changed in response to exercise in older 
adults compared to the pre-intervention measurement 
(Figure 5E). Mitochondrial genes numbered 17, with 14 
upregulated and 3 downregulated with exercise.  There 
were 2 genes involved in protein turnover that were 
significantly altered (both downregulated with exercise) 
following n3-PUFA supplementation. 
 
The Venn diagram in Figure 5F shows the genes that 
were significantly up or downregulated in response to 
exercise in young, old before n3-PUFA and old 
following n3-PUFA.  The single bout of exercise altered 
2,560 genes in young but only 483 genes in the older 
adults before the intervention.  There were 439 genes in 
common between young and old.  Following 16 weeks 
of n3-PUFA supplementation in older adults, there were 
473 genes significantly altered in response to exercise.  
Of these genes, 326 were in common with pre-
intervention gene responses, 398 were in common with 
young gene responses to exercise, and 50 were unique.  
We interrogated these 50 unique genes in an attempt to 
identify potential mechanisms that could explain the 
significant reduction of mitochondrial ROS production, 
increase in postabsorptive muscle protein synthesis, and 
potentiation of anabolic response to a single bout of 
exercise. Notably, there was downregulation of several 
genes known to be negative regulators of muscle growth 
and proliferation (dusp1, frzb, hbp1), downregulation of 
atrophy-related genes (bmp6), and upregulation of 
genes that promote protein synthesis (mrps12, spon2, 
prox1, nos1) and protein folding/assembly (fkbp2, 
sptbn4).  Furthermore, there was downregulation of 
inflammation-related 
genes 
(mmd, 
cxcl9) 
and 
upregulation of the adiponectic paralig c1qtnf6, which 
modulates inflammation by countering the actions of 
TGF beta.  Of the 9 candidate genes that were 
interrogated by RT-PCR, myostatin, a negative 
regulator of muscle anabolism, exhibited significant 
downregulation with exercise following n3-PUFA 
supplementation, which was not apparent before the 
intervention (Figure 3A).  In sum, RNA sequencing 
revealed a transcriptional signature that is consistent 
with the observed mitochondrial phenotype in skeletal 
muscle 
from 
older 
adults. 
 
Furthermore, 
the 
transcriptional changes induced by a single bout of 
exercise were attenuated in older adults compared to 
young with subtle effects of n3-PUFA on baseline 
muscle gene expression or gene expression changes 
following a single bout of exercise.  However, the 
expression of small number of genes that regulate 
muscle protein turnover and inflammation were 
uniquely altered by exercise in older adults only after 16 
weeks of n3-PUFA supplementation.

DISCUSSION 
 
The major salient observations in these studies are 
related 
to 
the 
effects 
of 
age 
and 
n3-PUFA 
supplementation on mitochondrial physiology, protein 
metabolism, and gene expression in human skeletal 
muscle.  First, unlike our previous rodent experiments 
[43, 44], we find that n3-PUFA did not increase 
mitochondrial oxidative capacity in older adults.  
However, 
n3-PUFA 
supplementation 
reduced 
mitochondrial oxidant emission rates.  Second, we find 
no age-related impairments in muscle protein synthesis 
rates at baseline or following exercise in spite of clear 
attenuation of transcriptional response to exercise 
compared to young.  Finally, 16 weeks of n3-PUFA 
supplementation 
increased

protein synthesis (particularly mitochondrial and 
sarcoplasmic fractions) and increased the synthesis rates 
of mitochondrial and myofibrillar proteins following 
exercise.    
 
The precedent literature is mixed concerning the effects 
of 
aging 
on 
muscle 
protein 
synthesis 
under 
postabsorptive conditions with some investigators 
reporting reductions in FSR with age [45, 46], while 
others do not [47, 48].  In the current cohort of healthy 
older adults, we do not observe any difference in 
postabsorptive muscle protein synthesis.  There is 
convincing evidence that anabolic responses to nutrition 
or exercise stimuli are blunted with aging [24-26].  
Although we find transcriptional evidence to support 
the concept of age-related anabolic resistance, the older 
individuals exhibited remarkably preserved muscle 
protein synthesis in response to exercise when 
compared to the young group.  One interpretation is that 
these older adults are somehow able to mount an 
anabolic response of translational machinery in the face 
of attenuated transcriptional messages.  Another 
possibility is that the timing of the post-exercise protein 
synthesis measurements may have missed the point in 
time where young and old differ in synthesis rate.  We 
chose to measure FSR between 15 and 18 hours 
following the single bout of exercise based on a 
previous report that mixed muscle FSR in young and 
older adults reached peak values 6hr post-exercise  and 
maintained until at least 24 hours post-exercise  when 
using the same exercise paradigm that we employed 
here [24].  Therefore, the 15-18 hour post-exercise 
window should capture peak muscle protein synthesis in 
both age groups.  Indeed, we observe a similar 
increment in muscle protein synthesis rates at 15-18 
hours post-exercise as Fry and colleagues observed at 6 
hours and 24 hours post-exercise [24].   
 
A major goal of this study was to determine the 
influence of n3-PUFA on mitochondrial physiology in 
human skeletal muscle. We recently reported that the 
anti-inflammatory effects of n3-PUFA were associated 
with 
upregulated 
transcriptional 
regulators 
of 
mitochondrial 
biogenesis 
[44] 
and 
marked 
improvements in mitochondrial function in old mice 
[43].  These early observations in mice fueled the 
current study to determine if such mitochondrial 
adaptations were evident in older humans.  In contrast 
to our previous observations in mice, 16 weeks of high 
dose n3-PUFA did not improve mitochondrial capacity 
in older humans (Figure 2), nor did we observe any 
increase in mRNA levels of genes encoding proteins 
involved in oxidative phosphorylation (Supplemental 
Figure 1), TCA cycle (Supplemental Figure 2), or lipid 
metabolism (Supplemental Figure 3).  This finding is 
consistent with our previous study in overweight 
insulin-resistant 
individuals 
where 
n3-PUFA 
supplementation did not alter muscle mitochondrial 
energetics [49].  Similarly, a recent study by Herbst et 
al. found that 12 weeks of n3-PUFA supplementation 
increased mitochondrial sensitivity to ADP without 
increasing maximal state 3 respiration [50].  We did not 
observe any changes in the respiratory control ratio 
(State 3/state 4) or ADP:O ratio that would indicate any 
change in bioenergetic efficiency of mitochondria. 
 
Mitochondrial oxidant emission is another parameter 
that helps define mitochondrial health.  Although no 
age-related increase in mitochondrial ROS production 
was apparent in this study, we found that ROS 
emissions were significantly lower in older adults 
following 
n3-PUFA 
administration. 
 
Although 
polyunsaturated fatty acids have been proposed to have 
antioxidant properties [51], we are unaware of any 
precedent literature showing that these bioactive lipids 
have direct influence on oxidant emitting potential of 
mitochondria. We do not know the mechanism by 
which n3-PUFA reduce mitochondrial ROS production, 
but the finding that n3-PUFA reduce ROS production in 
older adults is important from the standpoint of muscle 
health with aging.  Aging is often accompanied by 
increased oxidative stress and accumulation of damaged 
protein in skeletal muscle [52-54].  Discovering safe 
and effective ways to preserve the quality and function 
of the muscle proteome will help forestall many age-
related derangements in skeletal muscle.  In support of 
this, we previously found that n3-PUFA decreased post-
translational modification of proteins in muscle of old 
mice [43]; a finding that is likely linked with the effects 
of n3-PUFA on ROS production and ROS scavenging 
by endogenous antioxidants.   
 
The potential anabolic effects of n3-PUFA are 
suggested 
from 
observations 
that 
n3-PUFA 
supplementation augments the gains in muscle strength 
in response to training in elderly women [37].  Further 
support comes from a series of papers by Smith and 
colleagues demonstrating that 8 weeks of n3-PUFA 
supplementation increases protein synthesis rates during 
a 
hyperaminoacidemic-hyperinsulinemic 
clamp 
in 
young, middle-aged, and older adults [35, 55].  
Motivated by these early studies, we determined if n3-
PUFA could potentiate the anabolic responses to a 
single bout of exercise in older adults.  In agreement 
with Smith et al. [35], we found no significant change in 
mixed muscle protein synthesis rates in the basal 
postabsorptive state in older adults following n3-PUFA.  
However, when we examined protein synthesis rates in 
subcellular pools, we found that n3-PUFA significantly 
increased FSR in the mitochondrial and sarcoplasmic 
pools.  Omega-3 fatty acids also potentiated muscle 
protein synthesis after a single bout of exercise, 
 www.aging-us.com 
1107 
AGING  
primarily in the mitochondrial and myofibrillar 
fractions.  These results, combined with previous 
evidence that n3-PUFA enhance anabolic response to 
insulin and amino acids, suggest that n3-PUFA increase 
muscle anabolic responses to nutrition and physical 
activity in older adults.  A recent paper [56] used a very 
similar experimental design in young healthy men who 
were given 5g/day fish oil for 8 weeks.  Muscle protein 
synthesis was measured at rest, after a bolus of dietary 
protein, and after a single bout of exercise chased with a 
bolus of protein.  There were no effects of n3-PUFA on 
muscle protein synthesis in these young men, which is 
in contrast to our findings here in older men and 
women.  Key differences between the study of mcGlory 
et al. and the present study are the timing of post-
exercise biopsies, the addition of dietary protein prior to 
exercise, and subject characteristics, all of which make 
it difficult to extrapolate data or conclusions between 
the two studies.  It is important to highlight that we 
observed clusters of responders and non-responders 
whereby some individuals exhibited robust increases in 
exercise-stimulated protein synthesis while others do 
not.  Attempts to link responders and non responders 
with any measured characteristic, biochemical marker, 
or phenotype did not reveal any clear discriminating 
factors, but the current study is limited by a small 
sample size for this type of exploratory analysis. 
Notably, the high responders observed in figure 4 were 
largely women.  This observation is consistent with a 
recent study where n3-PUFA improved skeletal muscle 
function and quality in older women but not older men 
[38].  Further studies in larger cohorts with placebo 
control are required to further investigate the possibility 
that the anabolic effects of n3-PUFA differ between 
men and women. 
 
In an attempt to identify the mechanisms by which n3-
PUFA increased postabsorptive and exercise-stimulated 
protein synthesis, we first used RT-PCR to evaluate the 
expression of several genes known to regulate muscle 
protein turnover in response to exercise (Figure 3).  Of 
the 9 a priori identified genes, only myostatin emerged 
as a gene whose expression in response to exercise was 
altered by n3-PUFA.  As a negative regulator of muscle 
growth and differentiation, the significantly lower post-
exercise myostatin levels following n3-PUFA may 
partly explain the enhanced anabolic response to 
exercise.  We then mined the RNA sequencing dataset 
for genes known to regulate muscle protein turnover 
(Supplemental Figure 12).  As a whole, there are no 
obvious shifts in the gene set, but several individual 
genes exhibited greater changes following n3-PUFA.  
These genes included myostatin (mstn), the forkhead 
transcription factor foxo1 which mediates muscle 
wasting through control of the expression of several E3 
ligases, and calcineurin A (ppp3ca) which is a crucial 
signaling intermediate in muscle fiber hypertrophy.  
Next, we identified the genes that were uniquely altered 
with exercise following n3-PUFA supplementation, but 
not before the intervention (Figure 5F). Several negative 
regulators of muscle growth and proliferation (dusp1, 
frzb, hbp1) were downregulated, one atrophy-related 
gene (bmp6) was downregulated, and several genes that 
promote protein synthesis (mrps12, spon2, prox1, nos1) 
and protein folding/assembly (fkbp2, sptbn4) were 
upregulated.  These findings are in agreement with 
recent findings by Yoshino et al. [57] who demonstrate 
that n3-PUFA increased expression of genes related to 
extracellular matrix organization and decreased genes 
related to protein breakdown in skeletal muscle of older 
adults.  Altogether, these data suggest that n3-PUFA 
alter transcriptional patterns in skeletal muscle that 
enhance muscle protein turnover.  Others show that n3-
PUFA may enhance anabolic response to exercise by 
altering the phosphorylation of signaling transduction 
proteins in muscle such as mTOR and p70s6k [35].  
Taken together, the anabolic effects of n3-PUFA are 
likely mediated by transcriptional changes as well as 
changes to the activation of anabolic signaling proteins 
in skeletal muscle.   
 
There is growing evidence that chronic inflammation 
may influence muscle anabolic responses to nutrition 
and exercise. The translation efficiency of mRNA is 
compromised by high levels of inflammatory cytokines 
[31], and muscle protein synthesis in older adults is 
inversely related to levels of inflammatory cytokines 
[32, 33]. The hypothesis that inflammation may 
contribute to sarcopenia by inhibiting muscle protein 
anabolism is further supported from studies where 
reducing 
inflammation 
using 
non-steroidal 
anti-
inflammatory drugs improved postprandial protein 
synthesis [34] and enhanced muscle mass and strength 
gains in response to resistance exercise in older humans 
[36, 37]. Given the well-documented anti-inflammatory 
effects of n3-PUFA [41, 42], it reasonable to expect that 
the increases in muscle protein synthesis observed in 
this study could be consequent to reduced chronic 
inflammation.  However, we found that 16 weeks of 
high dose n3-PUFA supplementation did not reduce 
systemic inflammatory markers TNF-α, CRP, or IL-6 
(Table 2).  This finding is in agreement with others [35, 
38] and might be a reflection of the healthy status of our 
cohort, since patients with a high inflammatory status 
are more likely to present with improvements in 
inflammatory markers, metabolic profile and muscle 
wasting with n-3 PUFA [58-60].  Nevertheless, at the 
muscle 
level, 
there 
was 
downregulation 
of 
inflammation-related 
genes 
(mmd, 
cxcl9) 
and 
upregulation of the adiponectic paralog c1qtnf6, which 
modulates inflammation by countering the actions of 
TGF beta in older adults (Figure 5F).  The possibility 
 www.aging-us.com 
1108 
AGING  
that n3-PUFA modulate local tissue inflammation 
without influencing circulating inflammatory markers 
requires further exploration.  
 
The main limitation of the study is the open-label 
design without placebo control. Furthermore, the small 
sample size prevents adequately-powered post hoc 
explorations of sex differences or to determine what 
factors may predict responders and non-responders. 
Participants in this study were included only after 
satisfying an extensive list of inclusion and exclusion 
criteria, which limits the external validity of the results, 
particularly when generalizing to the aging population 
at large.  Among the strengths of the study was the high 
compliance 
rate, 
minimal 
attrition 
rate, 
and 
pharmacological dose of n-3 PUFA for an adequate 
time frame.  Gold standard methods were used to 
evaluate primary outcomes, and studies were conducted 
within the highly controlled environment of the Clinical 
Research and Trials Unit where participants were 
admitted for 2 nights following 3 days of standardized 
meals at the hospital.  
 
In conclusion, we demonstrate that dietary n3-PUFA 
induce potentially favorable adaptations within skeletal 
muscle 
in 
older 
adults, 
including 
decreased 
mitochondrial ROS production, increased muscle 
protein synthesis rates, and enhanced anabolic response 
to a single bout of exercise.  Future studies are needed 
to determine if these adaptations translate into 
meaningful improvements in metabolic and physical 
function in older adults when n3- PUFAs are given over 
longer periods of time or in combination with an 
exercise training program.

debilitating musculoskeletal or pulmonary disease 
which would impede participation in the exercise 
portion of the study. Pregnancy, breastfeeding, smoking 
and other substance abuse were also excluded, as well 
as medications which affect muscle metabolism (beta 
blockers, 
corticosteroids, 
tricyclic 
antidepressants, 
benzodiazepines, 
opiates, 
barbiturates) 
and 
anticoagulants. We did not exclude for statins or oral 
estrogens.  All participants completed a screening visit 
followed by a two-day inpatient study to evaluate 
muscle protein synthesis, acute exercise responsiveness, 
and mitochondrial physiology.  Older participants were 
studied 
again 
following 
a 
4-month 
open-label 
intervention of dietary n3-PUFA (3.9g/day).  The young 
participants were studied as a comparison group to 
determine the extent of skeletal muscle dysfunction 
with aging and did not undergo any intervention. The 
study design is illustrated in Figure 1.  
 
Screening 
 
Eligible participants were identified using a screening 
questionnaire via telephone or email. Those who met 
eligibility criteria reported to the Clinical Research and 
Trials Unit (CRTU) at Mayo Clinic Hospital, St. Marys 
Campus after fasting from 22:00 hrs the night before to 
assess eligibility by physical examination, resting 
electrocardiogram and comprehensive blood tests 
including complete blood count and biochemical tests 
of glucose, insulin, Hba1c, liver (ALT, AST, bilirubin), 
kidney (creatinine, GFR) and thyroid (TSH) function, as 
well as coagulation (INR), and lipid panel (Total, LDL, 
HDL-cholesterol, Triglycerides).  Participants had a 
consultation with a dietician to discuss food preferences 
and underwent measurements of body composition by 
dual-energy 
X-ray 
absorptiometry 
(DEXA) 
to 
determine whole body fat mass, body fat, and fat free 
mass (FFM) (Lunar DPX-; Lunar Radiation, Maddison, 
WI).  
 
VO2 peak 
 
Whole-body peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak) was 
measured by indirect calorimetry on a stationary cycle 
ergometer with an incremental workload as previously 
described [49]. The VO2 peak protocol began at a 
workload of 50 Watts for young adults and old males or 
25 Watts for old females, with an increase of 30 Watts 
every 2 min for young males or 20 Watts for young 
females and older adults. Participants were monitored 
throughout rest, exercise, and recovery by 12 lead ECG, 
blood pressure, and expired gasses.  Subjective level of 
exhaustion was assessed using the Borg scale.  
 
1 Repetition Maximum (1RM) 
 
Maximal knee extensor strength of the left leg was 
evaluated on two separate occasions under the guidance 
of the investigators. The protocol included a warm-up 
 www.aging-us.com 
1109 
AGING  
set of 10 repetitions using a light weight, followed by 2 
sets of up to 10 repetitions with 3 min-interval between 
sets. 1 RM was calculated from the average of the two 
sets using the formula: 1RM = ω·(1+r/30), where ω is 
the weight in arbitrary units and r the number of 
repetitions per set.  
 
Inpatient study design 
 
At least 7 days after the VO2 peak test, participants 
were admitted to the CRTU. For three days prior to 
admission they were provided a weight-maintaining diet 
by the CRTU metabolic kitchen. Macronutrient 
distribution of the diet was 20% protein, 50% 
carbohydrate and 30% fat. On the evening of the 3rd day 
of the diet, participants were admitted to the CRTU at 
1700 hrs and consumed nothing but water after 2200 
hrs. At 0500 hrs, a primed (1.5 mg·kg FFM-1), 
continuous infusion (1.5 mg·kg FFM-1·hr-1) of 13C6-
Phenylalanine was initiated as shown in Figure 1B.  
Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured for 20 
min starting at 0630 hrs using a ventilated hood and 
indirect calorimetry [49].  Muscle biopsies were 
obtained from the right vastus lateralis at 0800 hrs and 
1100 hrs for measuring post-absorptive protein 
synthesis rates from incorporation of intravenous 
labeled amino acid into muscle protein pools.  Biopsies 
were collected under local anesthesia (2% lidocaine) 
using a modified Bergstrom needle. Following the 
biopsy at 1200 hrs, participants were given a 
standardized meal containing 10 kcal/kg of 20% 
protein, 50% carbohydrate, and 30% fat. At 1600 hrs, 
participants performed seated unilateral leg extension 
using only the left leg.  Following a warm-up set, 
subjects completed 8 sets of 10 repetitions at 70% of 
their 1 RM, determined during the outpatient visit.  
Three minutes of rest were given between sets. This 
exercise paradigm has been previously used to assess 
the effects of acute resistance exercise on muscle 
anabolic response with aging [24].  The exercise was 
supervised by a member of the study team at the Dan 
Abraham Healthy Living Center, Saint Mary’s Hospital, 
where participants were escorted with the use of a 
wheelchair. A second meal was given at 1800 hrs with 
caloric content to achieve weight maintenance, after 
which participants remained fasted until the second set 
of protein synthesis measurements on day 2. The tracer 
infusion was initiated at 0400 hrs, followed by two 
serial muscle biopsies on the exercised leg at 0700 and 
1000 hrs. Participants were offered a meal and were 
discharged by noon of the second day.   
 
n-3 PUFA intervention 
 
The n3-PUFA softgels were supplied by Sancilio and 
Company, Inc. (Riviera Beach, FL) and stored in the 
Mayo Clinic Research Pharmacy at room temperature. 
During the intervention phase of the study, participants 
were instructed to swallow 2 softgels twice per day with 
meals.  The n3-PUFA softgels contained 675 mg of 
EPA and 300 mg of DHA for a total daily dosage of 3.9 
g/day and ratio of 2.25 EPA:DHA. The total omega-3 
fatty acids content of each capsule was 1050 mg, which 
also included 75 mg of “non n3-PUFA” omega-3 fatty 
acids.  The total fat content of the capsule was 1200 mg.  
This dose of n3-PUFA was chosen because it has been 
shown to augment the anabolic response of skeletal 
muscle under hyperinsulinemia and high amino acids 
[55]. Every 4 weeks, participants returned to the CRTU 
to pick up a new prescription, returned any remaining 
capsules, and give a fasting blood sample. The Mayo 
Clinic Research Pharmacy maintained records of 
receipt, dispensation, and return pill counts for 
compliance.  Compliance was also assessed at the end 
of the study by monthly measurements of EPA and 
DHA content of red blood cells (RBC), as well as 
plasma levels of EPA and DHA measured by mass 
spectrometry. The duration of the intervention was 4 
months.     
 
Muscle mitochondria function 
 
Mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Approximately 60 
mg of fresh muscle tissue was homogenized on ice 
immediately after the first muscle biopsy on day 1. 
Mitochondria 
were 
isolated 
by 
differential 
centrifugation and suspended in a respiration buffer 
(MiR05; Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria) as previously 
described [61]. Respiration of isolated mitochondria 
was 
measured 
by 
high 
resolution 
respirometry 
(Oxygraph 2K, Oroboros Instruments, Innsbruck, 
Austria) using a stepwise protocol to evaluate various 
components of the electron transport system [49, 53]. 
Oxygen flux rates (JO2) were assed in the presence of 
carbohydrate (glutamate + malate) and lipid (palmitoyl-
L-carnitine) substrates [61]. Mitochondrial protein 
content was measured using a colorimetric assay (Pierce 
660-nm Protein Assay). Oxygen consumption was 
expressed to tissue wet weight and also normalized to 
mitochondrial protein content. Mitochondrial coupling 
efficiency was measured from the respiratory control 
ratio (RCR) calculated by the quotient of state 3 and 
state 4 respiration. ADP:O ratio was determined by 
dividing the amount of ADP added to the chamber to 
the amount of atomic oxygen used during state III 
respiration, and by using PRISM v6.0e software 
(GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). 
 
Mitochondrial 
reactive 
oxygen 
species 
(ROS) 
production. Hydrogen peroxide production in isolated 
mitochondria (mtH2O2) was measured with a Fluorolog 
3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon) by 
 www.aging-us.com 
1110 
AGING  
continuously monitoring of oxidation of Amplex Red 
under the same respiratory conditions as described for 
oxygen consumption measurements as we have 
previously described [44, 53].  The fluorescent signal 
was adjusted for background auto-oxidation and 
calibrated to a standard curve. Rates of H2O2 production 
were normalized to tissue wet weight and to protein 
content of the mitochondrial isolate. 
 
Muscle protein synthesis rates 
 
Isotopic enrichment in muscle tissue fluid and muscle 
protein pools were measured by HPLC and tandem 
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) as previously described 
[44, 53, 62, 63]. Briefly, total mixed muscle, 
myofibrillar, 
mitochondrial, 
and 
sarcoplasmic 
(cytosolic), as well as tissue fluid free amino acid 
fractions were isolated from 10 mg of quadriceps.  The 
protein was hydrolyzed overnight in 6N HCL at 110oC.  
Phenylalanine from both tissue fluid and hydrolyzed 
proteins were isolated further via cation exchange 
column-AG50 and dried down prior to derivatizating to 
isobutyl esters. Data acquisition was performed in 
positive electrospray ionization mode with selecting ion 
monitoring at 222.4 > 121.6 and 226.4 > 125.6 for the 
m+2 and m+6 fragments of phenylalanine and L-[ring 
13C6]-phenylalanine 
respectively. 
Moles 
percent 
enrichment (MPE) was calculated against a 6-point-
enrichment standard curve. Fractional synthesis rate of 
mixed 
muscle, 
myofibrillar, 
mitochondrial 
and 
sarcoplasmic 
proteins 
was 
calculated 
from 
the 
increment in 13C6-Phenylalanine enrichment in the two 
serial muscle biopsies (E2-E1) using the average 
enrichment of tissue fluid 13C6-Phenylalanine as the 
precursor pool enrichment (Ep), based on the formula: 
FSR = (E2-E1) ·100/ Ep · time [%·h-1]. 
 
Quantitative PCR 
 
Approximately 20 mg of muscle was powdered in liquid 
nitrogen and total RNA extracted using a kit (RNeasy 
Fibrous Tissue, Qiagen) with DNAse treatment. RNA 
concentration and purity (A260/A280>2.0 for all 
samples) were determined by spectrophotometry 
(Nanodrop). Two micrograms of RNA were reverse-
transcribed to cDNA according to manufacturer’s 
instructions (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-
time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed 
in 384 well clear plates with 20μl reaction volume using 
20ng cDNA. Amplification conditions were 10 minutes 
at 60°C followed by 40 cycles of denaturing (95°C for 
15 s) and annealing (60°C for 60 s) using a ViiA7 
thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Samples were 
amplified with multiplex conditions in triplicate on a 
single plate with a ‘no template’ control, internal 
repeated control, and 7 point relative standard curve 
spanning 4 log dilutions.  Primers and probes were 
commercially produced (Applied Biosystems, TaqMan 
Gene Expression Assays) for 9 gene targets as shown in 
Supplemental Table 1. Efficiencies of the target and 
reference genes were similar (~95-100%) from the 
standard curve. Relative fold change was determined 
using the 2-ΔΔCt approach [64] with resting biopsy 
sample as the control condition. 
 
mRNA sequencing 
 
Total RNA was isolated as described above and RNA 
libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions for the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit v2 
(Illumina). Libraries were loaded onto paired end flow 
cells following the standard protocol for the Illumina 
cBot and cBot Paired end cluster kit version 3. Flow 
cells were sequenced as 51 x 2 paired end reads on an 
Illumina HiSeq 2000 using TruSeq SBS sequencing kit 
version 3 and HCS v2.0.12 data collection software. 
Base-calling was performed using Illumina’s RTA 
version 1.17.21.3.  The RNA-Seq data was analyzed 
using MAP-RSeq v.1.2.1 [65], the Mayo Bioinformatics 
Core pipeline. MAP-RSeq consists of alignment with 
TopHat 2.0.6 [66] against the hg19 genome build and 
gene counts with the HTSeq software 0.5.3p9 
(http://www.huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/ov
erview.html) using gene annotation files obtained from 
Illumina (http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/igenomes.html). 
Normalization and differential expression analysis were 
performed using edgeR 2.6.2 [67]. 
 
Analytical methods 
 
Glucose was measured in plasma samples by 
photometric hexokinase method. Insulin was measured 
by a two-site immunometric assay using electro 
chemiluminescence immunoassay “ECLIA” detection 
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). HOMA-IR index 
was calculated by the formula: fasting glucose 
(mmol/L) x fasting insulin (μIU/mL)/ 22.5 [68]. 
Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β and Tumor necrosis factor 
alpha (TNF-α) were measured from serum samples 
using a solid-phase ELISA by the Quantikine High 
Sensitivity Immunoassay. Leptin and adiponectin were 
measured by radioimmunoassay, and C-reactive protein 
by particle enhanced immune-turbidimetric assay. 
Blood measurements were done in the Mayo Clinic 
Immunochemical Core Laboratory. Plasma free fatty 
acids were measured against a standard curve on an 
Agilent 
6460 
triple 
quadrupole 
liquid 
chromatography/mass 
spectrometer 
(LC/MS) 
as 
previously described [69].

Statistical methodology 
 
Unpaired ttests were used to compare mitochondrial 
parameters (respiration rates, ROS production) between 
young and old groups prior to the intervention.  Paired 
ttests were used to examine the effects of n3-PUFA 
supplementation on these variables in older adults.  For 
variables that were measured at multiple time points 
such as gene expression and FSR before and after 
exercise, we identified a priori comparisons that would 
be made using paired ttests (pre- vs. post-exercise  in 
young, pre- vs. post-exercise  in old, pre-exercise before 
vs. after intervention) as well as unpaired comparisons 
by ttests (baseline young vs. baseline old, post-exercise  
young vs. post-exercise old).  When variables were not 
normally distributed, the Wilcoxon signed rank test was 
used for pre-post intervention for the older group, as 
well as for comparisons pre-post-exercise for both age 
groups. Continuous variables were summarized using 
mean ± SD or median (interquartile range, IQR) as 
appropriate. Statistical analysis was performed using 
JMP Software (SAS Institute, Cart, NC) and PRISM 
v6.0e (GraphPad Software Inc, La Jolla, CA). The Venn 
diagram in Figure 5 was generated using EulerAPE v3 
(eulerdiagrams.org).
