ABSTRACT
Purpose. To determine the prevalence and types of refractive errors in persons aged 35 years and older in the Inanda,
Ntuzuma, and KwaMashu (INK) area of Durban, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa.
Methods. Refractive error data were obtained by autorefraction (Retinomax K-Plus; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), retinoscopy, and
subjective refraction. Refractive error was defined using spherical equivalents as myopia (Gj0.5D) and hyperopia (9+0.5D).
Astigmatism was defined as cylinder equal to or greater than j0.5D in either eye.
Results. Participants’ ages ranged from 35 to 90 years, with a mean of 53.05 T 11.4 years. Women comprised 75% of the
subjects. The prevalence of refractive error was 57.3%, with myopia 11.4%, hyperopia 37.7%, and astigmatism 25.7%.
Myopia and astigmatism were significantly more prevalent in men (p G 0.01), whereas hyperopia was more prevalent in
women (p G 0.01). Hyperopia was significantly associated with education (p G 0.01), whereas myopia and astigmatism were
not (p = 0.09 and p = 0.15, respectively).
Conclusions. Approximately 57.3% of the population 35 years and older in the INK area of Durban were affected by
refractive errors, with myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism being significantly associated with sex. This study suggests that
there is a need for interventions to alleviate refractive error in the INK area as well as in other communities affected by the
lack of access to affordable services.

efractive error refers to the measure of a person’s short-
sightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and/or
astigmatism (corneal curvature), which are caused by an
incongruity between the axial length and the refractive power of
the optical elements (mainly cornea and lens) of the eye.1 Glob-
ally, refractive errors are one of the most common causes of visual
impairment, the fourth leading cause of blindness, and the second
cause of curable blindness.2 How refractive error affects vision de-
pends on the type (myopia, hyperopia, or astigmatism), the category
(axial or refractive), and the form of correction used (spectacles,
contact lenses, intraocular lenses, or refractive surgery).2
In 2003, it was estimated that more than 2.3 billion people in
the world suffered from poor vision because of corrected and
uncorrected refractive error.3 More recent estimates suggest that
more than 640 million people are visually impaired because they
do not have access to corrective treatment such as glasses, contact
lenses, or refractive surgery.4,5 Estimates in 2013 indicated that
uncorrected refractive error accounted for 52.9% of visual im-
pairment worldwide,4 suggesting that it is a global visual health
challenge. Epidemiological studies have reported differences in the
prevalence of refractive error. Reasons for differing estimates in-
clude differences in age, race, and ethnicity of the populations
studied. Other reasons for differences might include measurement
technique, the use of cycloplegics, and the criterion levels for the
refractive error categories.
Many people in developing countries, including South Africa,
have limited access to eye care services, which can be caused by the
unavailability of human resources (particularly optometrists) and
services not always being provided, accessible, or used, leading to a
high prevalence of visual impairment.6 The resulting uncorrected
refractive errors can lead to lost economic gain and missed

erally reduced quality of life.7
Despite the fact that refractive error is one of the most common
causes of visual impairment and the second leading cause of
blindness,8 few scientifically valid population-based studies of
refractive error in adults have been conducted in South Africa.
Naidoo et al.9 conducted a population-based study to assess the
prevalence of refractive error and visual impairment in school-
aged African children (aged 5 to 15 years) in South Africa in
2003 and found that the prevalence of uncorrected, presenting,
and best-corrected visual acuity (VA) of 20/40 or worse in the
better eye was 1.4%, 1.2%, and 0.32%, respectively. Refractive
error was the cause in 63.6% of the 191 eyes with reduced vision.9
A population-based refractive error study of young adults aged 15
to 35 years has also recently been concluded. The current study
looks at the refractive error component of a larger presbyopia
study10 that was conducted in the Inanda, Ntuzuma, and
KwaMashu (INK) areas and therefore completed the picture of
refractive error in the missing age group (35 years and older). This
information is necessary to determine the regions, population
groups, and age cohorts most in need of intervention and services
required and to provide the basis for effective service delivery,
monitoring, and evaluation.
The study area was composed of INK, historically disadvan-
taged communities of the eThekwini municipality of the province
of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, during apartheid. The total
population in this area is approximately 500,000 people and
consists of a mixture of urban, periurban, and semirural areas.
The area varies in the provision of and access to services and
resources compared with more advantaged areas but is repre-
sentative of the reality of most health districts in KwaZulu-Natal
and South Africa. As in the rest of South Africa, the delivery of
eye care follows the district health model and, currently, eye
care services are provided by four community health centers,
one district hospital, one private hospital, and several private
optometry practices.
METHODS
The research followed the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki,
and all participants gave consent to participate in the study after
the nature of the study had been explained to them. The research
was approved by the Biomedical Research and Ethics Committee
of the University of KwaZulu-Natal. Refractive error data were
collected during a multicountry population-based presbyopia
study that has been described elsewhere.10 The key methods are
summarized below for purposes of this article.
Sampling
The INK areas are on the outskirts of the coastal city of Durban.
A cluster sampling method was used to select the study population
using the enumerator areas (EAs) created during the 2001 census
in a geographic information system. A total of 265 EAs were listed,
and 20 EAs were randomly selected. All occupants of eligible
households 35 years or older who had lived in the INK area for
6 months or more and signed the consent form to partake in the
study were enrolled.
Field Operations
An enumeration team was responsible for visiting households
within the selected clusters in a door-to-door manner. All persons
35 years or older were enumerated by age, sex, education, and
spectacle use.
Clinical Examinations
Enumerated subjects meeting the selection criteria were re-
quested to attend designated community sites for VA measure-
ment, refraction, and near-vision assessment. For those disabled or
nonambulatory participants, transport was provided to take them
to and from the testing sites (schools and community halls). The
clinical examination process was as follows:
Noncycloplegic Refraction
Autorefraction was used to define refractive error. All partici-
pants underwent autorefraction using a handheld auto-refractor
(Retinomax K-Plus; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). This auto-refractor
was calibrated once a day before commencement of the clinical
examination process. Three or more readings were taken for the
right and left eyes of each participant. Auto-refractor confidence
readings less than 7 were discarded and repeated until acceptable
confidence levels were obtained.
Distance-Vision Assessment
Presenting distance VAs in ambient lighting conditions were
measured using the LogMAR ‘‘E’’ chart at 4 m (Precision Vision,
Villa Park, IL). Visual acuity was measured monocularly then
binocularly and recorded as the smallest line at which at least four
of the five optotypes were identified correctly. Participants with
spectacles were asked to remove them before testing and then to
wear them for repeat testing. Pinhole VAs were obtained for those
participants who failed to reach 20/20 aided (with own spectacles)
or unaided acuity. Retinoscopy was performed on all participants,
followed by subjective refraction to confirm findings. All these
other measures were only for clinical care.
Near-Vision Assessment
Near VA was measured in ambient lighting conditions with and
without near spectacles if used using a LogMAR near-vision ‘‘E’’
chart (Precision Vision). A string was attached to the near-vision
chart to ensure a measurement distance of 40 cm from the eyes.
Visual acuity was measured monocularly and binocularly and
recorded as the smallest line at which at least four of the five
optotypes were identified correctly.
Near-Vision Correction
After presenting near VA measurement, those with VA of less
than 20/40 were progressively tested with plus sphere spectacles to
obtain best corrected binocular vision. The spherical diopter
correction was recorded, along with the corresponding best
corrected near VA.

 Ocular Health Assessment
Ophthalmoscopy was conducted using direct ophthalmoscopes
by an optometrist, and patients with poor views of the ocular
fundus, suspicious retinal signs, and/or potentially glaucomatous
cupping were referred for further dilated-pupil fundus investigation
at their local hospital. Anterior segment examinations consisted of
direct observation of the conjunctiva, sclera, and cornea by a di-
agnostically certified optometrist for any ocular abnormalities.
Pilot Study
A pilot study was conducted in a cluster that was not part of the
20 EAs selected for the study. This study provided the opportunity
to monitor and observe personnel in carrying out all aspects of the
study in a representative field setting, from enumeration through
data entry. Findings from the pilot study were fed back and
discussed with clinical and nonclinical staff to address areas of
inconsistencies and methods with which to correct these in-
consistencies. The pilot also indicated areas of improvement in the
logistical and operational aspects of the study.
Definitions
In this study, myopia was defined as a spherical power of less
than j0.5D in both eyes or in one eye (if the other eye was
emmetropic). Hyperopia was defined as a spherical power of
greater than +0.5D in both eyes or in one eye (if the other eye was
emmetropic). A cylindrical power of less or equal to j0.5D in
both eyes or in one eye (if the other eye was emmetropic) was
considered as astigmatism. Astigmatism was classified as with-the-
rule (WTR) if the axis meridian lay 15 degrees on either side of
the horizontal and against-the-rule (ATR) if the axis meridian lay
15 degrees on either side of the vertical, and oblique if the axis
meridian lay between 15 and 75 degrees or 105 and 165 degrees.11
The same definitions were used in other similar population-based
studies.11,12 These definitions have emerged from both the World
Health Organization and the National Eye Institute recommen-
dations and have allowed comparisons across countries and
regions.13 Where the refractive error in each eye was different
(one eye myopic and the other hyperopic), it was recorded as
antimetropia. Emmetropia was defined as spherical power be-
tween j0.25 and +0.5D. For this study, presenting and aided
VAs worse than and including 20/40 that showed improvement
with pinhole were considered for distance refraction. If a par-
ticipant’s near VA was worse than N8 (20/40) at 40 cm, near add
testing was conducted until best near vision was achieved. Spectacles
for near were dispensed at the testing site, whereas participants
needing spectacles for distance were referred to an optometrist at a
state hospital where they could receive spectacles free of charge.
Participantswithocularpathologieswereprovidedwithreferralletters
to their local hospitals for an ophthalmological examination.
Data Management and Analysis
The data forms were checked for accuracy and completeness in
the field before data entry at the Brien Holden Vision Institute
Durban offices. The participants’ refractive error data were ana-
lyzed using STATA (version 11.0). The analysis included the
generation of descriptive statistics to report the means, standard
deviation, ranges, proportions, and their 95% confidence intervals
(CIs). The comparisons of mean participant ages and the ages of
thosewithmyopia,hyperopia,andastigmatismwereperformedusing
t-tests. A 5% level of significance was used for all statistical analyses.
Quality Assurance
Because of the large number of participants needing to be seen
at the testing sites, quality assurance was done on days when the
numbers permitted because this was done by one of the designated
clinicians who was authorized to perform this function throughout
the study to ensure continuity. Findings by the original clinicians
were not made known to the designated clinician. The final results
from the designated clinician were compared with the results from
the original clinicians.
RESULTS
Of the 2764 persons aged 35 years and older who were enu-
merated, 1939 (70%) were examined and considered to be the
study participants. Their ages ranged from 35 to 90 years, with a
mean of 53.05 T 11.4 years, and consisted of 483 (25%) men and
1456(75%)women.Themeanageforwomenwas53.6T10.7years
(95% CI, 52.6 to 54.5), whereas the mean age of the men was 52.9T
11.6 years (95% CI, 52.3 to 53.5). The majority (80%) of partic-
ipants were aged between 38 and 69 years. A total of 111 (5.7%) had
no education, 645 (33.3%) had less than primary school education,
513 (26.5%) had completed primary school, 251 (12.9%) had
secondary school education, 144 (7.4 %) had at least high school
education, and 275 (14%) did not report their education level.
Visual Acuity
Presenting VA of 20/40 or better in at least one eye was found in
1421 (73.3%) of the participants, whereas VA worse than 20/40
in the better eye was present in 518 (26.7%) of the participants.
Presenting VA was with the habitual correction and therefore
represented presumably correctable refractive error.
Refractive Errors
Of the 1939 participants, 1111 (57.3%) were found to have
refractive errors. With respect to the study population, 221
(11.4%) had myopia, 731 (37.7%) had hyperopia, 18 (0.9%) had
antimetropia, whereas 498 (25.7%) has astigmatism. Table 1 shows
the distribution of the refractive errors by sex, age, and education.
For the right eye, myopia ranged between j0.625 and j18.5D,
hyperopia ranged between +0.625 and +13D, and astigmatism
ranged between j0.75 and j7.75D. The mean spherical equiva-
lent (SE) was 0.32 T 1.5 SD (95% CI, j0.25 to +0.38D). For the
left eye, myopia ranged between j0.625 and j17.5D, hyperopia
ranged between +0.625 and +13.375D, and astigmatism ranged
between j0.75 and j5.25D. The mean SE was +0.31 T 1.5 SD
(95% CI, +0.24 to +0.38D).
Myopia
Of those examined, 221 (11.4%; 95% CI, 9.1 to 13.7%) had
myopia. The mean age among the myopes was 57.2 T 14.9 years,

 higher than the mean age of the study population. One hundred
forty-one (16.6%) men and 80 (9.7%) women presented with
myopia; this higher prevalence in men being reversed among the
80+-year age group. There was a statistically significant rela-
tionship between myopia and sex (p G 0.01). Myopia showed no
significant relationship with education (p = 0.09). Eighteen
(16.2%) participants examined who had no education had my-
opia, and 17 (11.8%) of those with at least high school education
had myopia.
Hyperopia
Of the 1939 participants, 731 (37.7%) (95% CI, 35.5 to 39.9%)
had hyperopia, their mean age being 56.8 T 9.8 years, higher than
the mean age of the study population (53.0 T 11.4 years). One
hundred forty-two (29.4%) men and 589 (40.5%) women had
hyperopia, the prevalence being significantly higher in women than
in men (p G 0.01). Forty-four (39.6%) of the participants examined
who reported having no education presented with hyperopia,
whereas 40 (27.8%) with at least high school education had hy-
peropia, this condition showing a significant relationship with ed-
ucational levels (p G 0.01).
Astigmatism
A total of 498 (25.7 %) participants had astigmatism, which
included those with only astigmatism and those with myopia
or hyperopia concurrent with astigmatism. Mean age was 58.3 T
12.0 years. This was significantly different from that of the study
population (p G 0.01). A total of 146 (30.2%) men and 352
(24.2%) women had astigmatism, presenting as a significant
difference in the presence of astigmatism between the sexes (p G
0.01). Thirty-four (30.6%) participants examined who reported
no education had astigmatism, whereas 85 (25%) of those with at
least high school education presented with astigmatism. However,
astigmatism was not associated with levels of education (p = 0.15).
There was a significant association between age and the type of
astigmatism for both eyes (p G 0.01). With-the-rule astigmatism
was more prevalent in the younger age group (aged 35 to 49 years)
than the older age group (aged 50+ years), whereas ATR astig-
matism showed the opposite trend. The distribution of the types
of astigmatism by age for the right and left eyes is illustrated
in Table 2. Oblique astigmatism increased sharply from SE = j5
to SE = 0. With-the-rule astigmatism increased from SE = j18 to
SE = j1, where it sharply increased to SE = +1. Against-the-rule
astigmatism was lower than oblique and WTR astigmatism and
showed an increase from SE = j9 to SE = +2. The average cu-
mulative frequency graph for SE by type of astigmatism for the
right and left eyes is shown in Fig. 1.
An analysis of the impact of refractive error on VA was
performed to provide context to the burden of refractive errors. In
the right eyes, 45.21% of participants with myopia had moderate
visual impairment (G20/63 to 9=20/200), whereas in the left eye,
46.45% had this level of visual impairment (Table 3). Hyperopia
constituted most of the refractive errors where participants had no
visual impairment (9=20/40), 57.26% and 57.95% in the right
and left eyes, respectively (Table 3). The impact of astigmatism on
VA showed a similar trend as that of hyperopia (Table 3).
DISCUSSION
Approximately 98 million of the 259 million people in the
world who suffer from visual impairment do so because of un-
corrected refractive errors.6 There are insufficient data on the

 prevalence and types of refractive errors in different populations
and age groups to allow for effective planning and intervention
programs in South Africa. There is therefore a need to conduct
prevalence studies in different parts of the country to deter-
mine the regional magnitude of refractive error, which will assist
health authorities to formulate appropriate strategies to address
refractive error.
Table 4 provides an overview of prevalence of refractive errors
in selected surveys among adult populations of different ages.
Our estimated prevalence of refractive error is higher than the
30.8% reported in a previous South African study conducted in
Cape Town14 but different from those reported in Nigeria15 and
Kenya.16 It is however not possible to make general overall
comparisons among these results because of differences in ethnic
backgrounds and age groups used in these studies. For example,
in the Cape Town study, participants’ ages ranged from 16 to
74 years and the race distribution included black, white, and
colored (mixed race). In addition, the study defined myopia as the
SE in the better eye of j1D or worse, hyperopia as the SE value in
the better eye of greater than or equal to +1D, and astigmatism as
j0.5 cylinder or worse in the better eye (Table 4).
The prevalence of myopia in this study is lower than that reported
in Ghana17 and comparable to those reported in South Africa,14
Australia,18 India,19 and Taiwan20 but differ substantially from
those reported in Nigeria,15 Western Europe,18 United States,18
Singapore,21 and China.22 This may suggest that different regions
may have different predisposition to myopia because of various
factors. However, the variability in the definition of myopia, in age
cohorts, and in the selection of participants prevents a direct
comparison. For example, the Eye Disease Prevalence Research
Group (EDPRG)18 included people 40 years and older and defined
myopia as an SE value of less than or equal to j1D, whereas the
present study included adults aged 35 years and older and defined
myopia as an SE value of less than j0.5D (Table 4). The current
study found an increase in myopia with an increase in age (except in
the 80+-year age range), possibly reflecting increasing prevalence of
age-related cataracts (nuclear sclerosis).15 The prevalence of myopia
was lower in women than in men, except for the 80+-year age group,
which differs from previous studies23Y25 that showed that myopia
was higher in women than in men. There was no statistically sig-
nificant difference between myopia and educational status (p =
0.09). In this sample, myopia contributed a significant degree of
visual impairment (Table 3). This burden of visual impairment
causedbymyopiacan bereversed asthecondition isfully correctable
by spectacles or contact lenses. These suggest the need for inter-
vention programs for individuals with these refractive errors.

 The prevalence of hyperopia in the current study was similar to
that reported in Ghana,17 higher than that reported in South
Africa,15 Nigeria,16 Australia,18 Western Europe,18 United States,18
Singapore,21 and China22 but lower than that reported in Taiwan.20
However, the prevalence of emmetropia in the present study was
much higher (42.7%). The upper limit of hyperopia was high be-
cause there may have been some aphakia. This wide variation could
in part be caused by the variations in definitions of hyperopia and/or
age groups and ethnicities used in the various studies. For example,
the EDPRG18 defined hyperopia as an SE value of greater than or
equal to +3D, whereas Dandona et al.,19 Cheng et al.,20 Wong
et al.,21 Liang et al.,22 and the current study defined hyperopia as
an SE value of greater than or equal to +0.5D (Table 4). Hyperopia
was found to be significantly associated with age, this being similar
to reports of earlier studies.16,26 The increase in hyperopia with age
may be caused by a loss of residual accommodation or a decrease in
the power of the aging lens. The prevalence of hyperopia was higher
in women than in men, this being similar to other studies.21,26 This
may be because, on average, women’s eyes have a shorter axial length
and shallower anterior chamber depth than those of men, resulting
in a higher probability of being hyperopic.27 The condition was
significantly associated with educational status, a finding similar to
that of Otutu et al.14 in three communities of Cape Town, South
Africa. More than one-half of hyperopes had VAs of 20/40 or better.
However, 42.74 and 42.05% of hyperopia in the right and left
eyes, respectively, contributed to some form of visual impairment
(G20/40 to G20/200). Correction by spectacles or contact lenses
could significantly impact visual impairment because of hyperopia
in this group.
Astigmatism included those with only astigmatism as well as
those with myopia or hyperopia concurrent with astigmatism. The
prevalence of astigmatism in this study is comparable to that
reported in rural China22 but very different to those reported in
other countries (Table 4). There is therefore a wide variation in the
prevalence of astigmatism among the studies. It is again difficult
to compare them because definitions and methods varied. The
EDPRG18 defined astigmatism as a cylinder of 1D or more in the
eye with higher astigmatism, whereas Dandona et al.19 and Liang
et al.22 excluded participants who were wearing corrective spectacles
and analyzed results of the right eyes only. Otutu et al.14 defined
astigmatism as j0.5D cylinder or worse in the better eye (Table 4).
The prevalence of astigmatism increased with age. This is
consistent with the results of other studies,26,28 which found that
mean total astigmatism increased with age. Nuclear sclerosis
cataract and the change in refractive index of the crystalline lens at
older ages may contribute to the increase in astigmatism.29 This
sample had ATR as the most common form. The proportion of
different types of astigmatism was related to the presence and
magnitude of ametropia, WTR being more commonly detected in
myopes and ATR inmoderate ametropia (Fig. 1). Other studies30,31

 have reported similar findings. There was a significantly higher
prevalence of astigmatism in men than in women (p G 0.01), this
being in contrast to the South African (Cape Town) study,14 which
reported no significant difference in the presence of astigmatism in
both sexes (p = 0.09). However, astigmatism showed no significant
association with levels of education (p = 0.15). About one-half of
astigmats had VAs of 20/40 or better, with an almost similar pro-
portion contributing to some form of visual impairment (G20/40 to
G20/200). It is therefore important to inform people with astig-
matism of the benefits of proper correction.
Several limitations of our study must be acknowledged. First,
the relatively low response rate (70%) may have affected the
prevalence of refractive errors. Second, the number of men and
women were disproportionately distributed and could have
influenced the results of the study. This may be caused by a number
of reasons including high levels of unemployment among women
and the mobility and migration of men to other areas in search of
employment. Third, there was no way to compare participants and
nonparticipants and, therefore, the degree of bias is unknown. An
additional limitation is that measures were noncycloplegic.
CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that refractive error affects approximately
two-thirds (57.3%) of the population (aged 35 years or older) in
the INK area of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The frequency for
myopia was 11.4%, hyperopia 37.7%, astigmatism 25.7%,
antimetropia 0.9%, and emmetropia 42.7%. Myopia and astig-
matism were found to increase with increased age, and hyperopia
increased with increased age except for the 80+-year age group.
Myopia and astigmatism were more common in men than in
women, whereas hyperopia was more common in women. In
addition, hyperopia was associated with the level of education,
whereas myopia and astigmatism were not associated with edu-
cational levels. These data on the prevalence of refractive errors can
be useful for planning refractive services. The study also highlights
the need to develop standardized protocols to facilitate compar-
isons between studies.
