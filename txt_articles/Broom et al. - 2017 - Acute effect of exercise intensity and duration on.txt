Abstract
Acute exercise transiently suppresses the orexigenic gut hormone acylated ghrelin, but 
the extent to which exercise intensity and duration determine this response is not fully 
understood. The effects of manipulating exercise intensity and duration on acylated 
ghrelin concentrations and hunger were examined in two experiments. In experiment 
one, nine healthy males completed three, 4-h conditions (control, moderate-intensity 
running (MOD) and vigorous-intensity running (VIG)), with an energy expenditure of 
~2.5 MJ induced in both MOD (55-min running at 52% peak oxygen uptake (V
.
O2peak)) 
and VIG (36-min running at 75% V
.
O2peak). In experiment two, nine healthy males 
completed three, 9-h conditions (control, 45-min running (EX45) and 90-min running 
(EX90)). Exercise was performed at 70% V
.
O2peak. In both experiments, participants 
consumed standardised meals, and acylated ghrelin concentrations and hunger were 
quantified at predetermined intervals. In experiment one, delta acylated ghrelin 
concentrations were lower than control in MOD (ES = 0.44, P = 0.01) and VIG (ES = 0.98, 
P < 0.001); VIG was lower than MOD (ES = 0.54, P = 0.003). Hunger ratings were similar 
across the conditions (P = 0.35). In experiment two, delta acylated ghrelin concentrations 
were lower than control in EX45 (ES = 0.77, P < 0.001) and EX90 (ES = 0.68, P < 0.001); 
EX45 and EX90 were similar (ES = 0.09, P = 0.55). Hunger ratings were lower than 
control in EX45 (ES = 0.20, P = 0.01) and EX90 (ES = 0.27, P = 0.001); EX45 and EX90 were 
similar (ES = 0.07, P = 0.34). Hunger and delta acylated ghrelin concentrations remained 
suppressed at 1.5 h in EX90 but not EX45. In conclusion, exercise intensity, and to a lesser 
extent duration, are determinants of the acylated ghrelin response to acute exercise.
Introduction
Obesity is characterised by a chronic energy imbalance 
reflecting a surplus of energy intake above expenditure 
and remains a major global public health and economic 
burden (Wang et al. 2011, Ng et al. 2014). Recent years 
have witnessed significant research into the relationship 
between exercise, appetite regulation and energy balance 
(Schubert et al. 2014). Exercise is recommended as a 
therapeutic weight management strategy because it

increases energy expenditure, which contributes to a 
negative energy balance if unaccompanied by an increase 
in energy intake (Donnelly et al. 2009). Evidence suggests 
acute exercise transiently suppresses feelings of hunger 
during and shortly after exercise (Broom et al. 2007, 
2009, King et al. 2010a), which has been termed ‘exercise-
induced anorexia’ (King et al. 1994). Furthermore, 
these responses often coincide with exercise-induced 
fluctuations in hormones that regulate energy balance 
and appetite (Schubert et al. 2014).
Appetite and energy intake are regulated by the 
neuroendocrine system, of which gut peptides play an 
integral role as episodic signals for hunger and satiety 
(Karra & Batterham 2010, Hussain & Bloom 2013). 
Ghrelin is the only known orexigenic gut peptide and 
is predominantly secreted from the stomach (Karra & 
Batterham 2010). Ghrelin exists in two forms (acylated 
and unacylated) and although only 10–20% of circulating 
ghrelin is acylated, it is believed that this form is solely 
responsible for appetite stimulation (Ghigo et al. 2005). 
Considering the central role of acylated ghrelin in 
appetite regulation, it is not surprising that the interaction 
between exercise and acylated ghrelin continues to attract 
scientific enquiry.
Acute moderate- to high-intensity exercise suppresses 
acylated ghrelin concentrations (King et al. 2013, 
Schubert et al. 2014). This hormonal alteration appears 
transient and typically coincides with a reduction in 
hunger during and immediately after exercise (Broom et al. 
2007, 2009, King et al. 2010a). Exercise intensity has 
been identified as a potential determinant modulating 
the acylated ghrelin response to exercise (Broom et al. 
2007, King et al. 2010a), with suppression occurring after 
exercise at higher (≥60% peak oxygen uptake (V
.O2peak)) 
(Broom et al. 2007, 2009, King et al. 2010a) but not 
lower (≤50% V
.O2peak) (Ueda et al. 2009, King et al. 2010b) 
intensities. Studies comparing acute moderate- vs high-
intensity exercise suggest exercising at a higher intensity 
may be more potent for suppressing acylated ghrelin 
concentrations (Deighton et al. 2013, Metcalfe et al. 
2015). However, the effect of isoenergetic exercise bouts 
at different intensities has revealed contrasting findings 
(Sim et al. 2014, Martins et al. 2015, Howe et al. 2016); 
therefore, further research is required to elucidate the 
importance of exercise intensity on appetite regulation.
Alterations in ghrelin concentrations and hunger 
perceptions may also be influenced by manipulations 
in exercise duration. Erdmann et al. (2007) reported 
that 30, 60 and 120 
min of cycling at 50 
W resulted in 
 
a similar increase in total ghrelin concentrations 
 
(50–70 
pg/mL) during exercise without any changes 
in hunger. However, the assessment of total ghrelin 
may obscure important changes in acylated ghrelin 
(Hosoda et al. 2004), and exercise studies measuring 
total ghrelin have yielded equivocal findings (King et al. 
2013). The effect of exercise duration on acylated ghrelin 
concentrations has not yet been examined and may have 
important implications regarding the use of exercise as a 
weight control strategy.
This 
investigation 
comprises 
two 
experiments 
that aimed to advance the understanding of appetite 
and hormonal responses to different acute exercise 
manipulations. Experiment one compared the effect 
of acute isoenergetic moderate- and vigorous-intensity 
running on acylated ghrelin concentrations and hunger 
perceptions. In experiment two, the acylated ghrelin 
and hunger responses to single bouts of 45- and 90-min 
running were examined.
Methods
Participants
This investigation contains two experimental studies 
that were approved by the University Ethical Advisory 
Committee. Two different groups of healthy, recreatio-
nally active men provided their written informed consent 
to participate in one of the experiments. Information from 
a health screen questionnaire revealed that all participants 
were metabolically healthy, non-smokers, not taking 
medication, body mass stable for at least 6 months (±2 
kg) 
and not currently dieting. Physical and physiological 
characteristics of participants are presented in Table 1.
Preliminary measures
Participants attended the laboratory for two preliminary 
visits before the main conditions in each experiment. 
During the first visit, anthropometric data (stature, 
body mass, waist circumference and skinfold thickness) 
were collected, and participants were familiarised with 
exercising on the treadmill (RUNRACE, Techno gym, 
Gambettola, Italy).
During the second visit, participants completed 
two exercise tests. The first test consisted of a 16-min 
submaximal incremental running test to determine 
the relationship between running speed and oxygen 
consumption. Participants completed 4 
× 
4-min stages 
with the initial running speed set between 7 and 8 
km/h

depending on the participant’s fitness level, which was 
increased by 1–1.5 
km/h at the start of each subsequent 
stage. 
Oxygen 
consumption 
and 
carbon 
dioxide 
production were determined from expired air samples 
collected in the final minute of each stage along with 
the participant’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) using 
Borg’s 6–20 scale (Borg 1973). Heart rate was monitored 
continuously using short-range telemetry (Polar A3, 
Kempele, Finland).
After 30-min standardised rest, V
. O2peak was measured 
using an incremental uphill treadmill protocol at a 
constant speed (Taylor et al. 1955). The initial treadmill 
gradient was set at 3.5%, which was increased by 2.5% 
every 3 
min until volitional exhaustion (Taylor et al. 
1955). Peak oxygen consumption was determined from 
an expired air sample collected during the final minute 
of the test when participants indicated that they could 
only continue for an additional 1 
min. Heart rate and 
RPE were monitored throughout the test as described 
previously. Data from the two preliminary exercise tests 
were used to determine the running speeds required 
during the main conditions.
Experimental design
In each experiment, participants completed three, 1-day 
conditions in a random order separated by at least one 
week. Participants weighed, recorded and replicated 
their food intake in the 24 
h before each main condition. 
Participants abstained from caffeine, alcohol and 
strenuous physical activity during the same period. All 
conditions commenced between 08:00 and 09:00 after an 
overnight fast of at least 10 
h. The study design in both 
experiments is presented in Fig. 1.

running (MOD) and vigorous-intensity running (VIG). 
Participants rested in the laboratory throughout the 
control condition. The exercise conditions commenced 
with participants running on the treadmill at a speed 
predicted to elicit either 50% V
. O2peak (MOD) or 75% 
V
.O2peak (VIG), which was designed to induce a gross 
energy expenditure of 2510 
kJ. Expired air samples were 
collected at regular intervals to calculate the relative 
exercise intensity, and the treadmill speed was adjusted 
occasionally to ensure that the target intensity was met. 
The exercise energy expenditure and substrate oxidation 
were estimated via indirect calorimetry (Frayn 1983). 
Heart rate was monitored throughout, and RPE was 
recorded during the last 10 s of each expired air sampling 
period. After the exercise bout, participants rested in the 
laboratory for the remainder of the condition.
A standardised meal prescribed relative to body mass 
was provided at 3 
h and consumed within 15 
min, which 
consisted of white bread, tuna, mayonnaise, chocolate bar, 
potato crisps, apple and orange juice. The standardised 
meal provided 60 
kJ energy, 2.13 
g (56% of meal total 
energy) carbohydrate, 0.53 
g (15%) protein and 0.47 
g 
(29%) fat per kilogram body mass. Water was provided 
ad libitum throughout each condition.
Experiment two: exercise duration
Nine 
men 
(21–28 
years) 
completed 
three, 
9-h 
experimental conditions: control, 45-min running 
(EX45) and 90-min running (EX90). Participants rested 
in the laboratory throughout the control condition. 
During the exercise conditions, participants ran on the 
treadmill at a speed predicted to elicit 70% V
. O2peak for 
45 min (EX45) or 90 min (EX90). Expired air samples 
were collected at regular intervals to calculate the 
relative exercise intensity, and the treadmill speed was 
adjusted occasionally to ensure that the target intensity 
was achieved. The exercise energy expenditure and 
substrate 
oxidation 
were 
estimated 
via 
indirect 
calorimetry (Frayn 1983). Heart rate was monitored 
throughout, and RPE was recorded during the last 10 s 
of each expired air sampling period. After the exercise 
bout, participants rested in the laboratory for the 
remainder of the condition.
Participants 
consumed 
identical 
standardised 
 
meals prescribed relative to body mass within 15 min 
at 2 and 6 h. The meals consisted of white bread, 
Cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, butter, potato crisps, 
milkshake powder and whole milk. The standardised 
meals provided 46 kJ energy, 0.95 g (33%) carbohydrate, 
0.31 g (11%) protein and 0.69 g (56%) fat per kilogram 
 
body mass. Water was provided ad libitum throughout 
each condition.
Hunger perceptions
Ratings of perceived hunger were assessed at baseline 
(fasted) and every 30 
min during both experiments 
using a 100 
mm Visual Analogue Scale (Flint et al. 2000). 
An additional measurement was taken at 45 
min in 
experiment two.
Blood sampling
Venous blood samples were collected via a cannula 
(Venflon, 
Becton 
Dickinson) 
inserted 
into 
an 
antecubital vein. All samples were collected in the semi-
supine position, except the samples scheduled during 
exercise, which were taken while participants straddled 
the treadmill. Plasma acylated ghrelin concentrations 
were 
determined 
from 
blood 
samples 
collected 
into pre-chilled 4.9 mL EDTA monovettes (Sarsedt, 
Leicester, UK) at 0 (baseline), 0.08, 0.5, 1, 3, 3.5 and 
4 h in experiment one and at 0 (baseline), 0.75, 1.5, 2, 
3, 6, 7 and 9 h in experiment two. These monovettes 
contained p-hydroxymercuribenzoic acid (PHMB) to 
prevent the degradation of acylated ghrelin by protease. 
Monovettes were spun at 1287 g for 10 min at 4°C 
(Burkard, Hertfordshire, UK). The plasma supernatant 
was aliquoted into a storage tube, and 100 µL of 1 M 
hydrochloric acid was added per millilitre of plasma 
(Hosoda et al. 2004). Samples were re-centrifuged at 
1287 g for 5 min at 4°C prior to storage at −80°C for 
later analysis.
Plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were 
determined from blood samples collected into pre-chilled 
9 
mL EDTA monovettes (Sarsedt, Leicester, UK). Glucose 
concentrations were measured at 0 (baseline), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 
2, 2.5, 3, 3.5 and 4 
h in experiment one and at 0 (baseline), 
0.75, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7, 8 and 9 
h in experiment 2. 
Insulin concentrations were measured at 0 (baseline), 0.5, 
1, 2, 3, 3.5 and 4 
h in experiment one and at 0 (baseline), 
0.75, 1.5, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 9 
h in experiment two. Monovettes 
were centrifuged immediately at 1681 
g for 10 
min at 4°C 
(Burkard, Hertfordshire, UK). The plasma supernatant was 
aliquoted into Eppendorf tubes prior to storage at −80°C 
for subsequent analysis.

determined to estimate acute changes in plasma volume 
(Dill & Costill 1974).
Biochemical analysis
In 
both 
experiments, 
plasma 
acylated 
ghrelin 
concentrations were determined using a commercially 
available enzyme immunoassay (SPI BIO, Montigny le 
Bretonneaux, France). Plasma glucose concentrations 
were determined using an automated centrifugal 
analyser (Cobas Mira Plus, Roche). For experiment 
one, plasma insulin concentrations were determined 
by a solid phase 125I radioimmunoassay available in a 
commercial kit (MP Biomedicals, Orangeburg, NY, USA) 
using an automated gamma counter system (Cobra 
II, Packard Instrument, Downers Grove, IL, USA). For 
experiment two, plasma insulin concentrations were 
quantified using a commercially available enzyme-
linked immunoassay (Mercodia, Uppsala, Sweden). 
The within-batch coefficient of variation for acylated 
ghrelin, glucose and insulin were 7.0, 1.4 and 8.9%, 
respectively, in experiment one and 2.2, 0.6 and 4.7%, 
respectively, in experiment two.
Statistical analyses
Data were analysed using IBM Statistics Software 
for 
Windows, 
version 
21 
(IBM 
Corporation). 
Time-averaged 
area 
under 
the 
curve 
(AUC) 
 
values were calculated using the trapezoidal rule. 
Normality of the data was checked using Shapiro–
Wilk tests. Normally distributed data are presented 
as mean (s.d.). Data for hunger, glucose and insulin 
 
were natural log transformed prior to analysis. These 
data are presented as geometric mean (95% confidence 
interval), and analysis is based on ratios of the 
geometric means. Acylated ghrelin concentrations 
are presented relative to baseline concentrations 
 
(i.e., delta) to minimise the potential influence of day-
to-day biological variation in this appetite hormone 
(Deighton et al. 2014).
In both experiments, linear mixed models repeated 
for condition were used to examine differences in 
exercise responses, fasting (baseline) concentrations and 
AUC values. Differences in metabolite concentrations 
between conditions over time were examined using 
linear mixed models repeated for condition and time. 
In experiment two, temporal changes in AUC responses 
for hunger and acylated ghrelin between experimental 
conditions were examined over sub-sections of the 
9-h measurement period (0–2, 2–6 and 6–9 h) using 
separate linear mixed models with condition as the 
sole factor. All linear mixed models included a random 
effect for each participant. Where significant condition 
and interaction effects were found, post hoc analysis 
was performed using the Holm–Bonferroni correction 
for multiple comparisons (Atkinson 2002). Correction 
of acylated ghrelin, glucose and insulin concentrations 
for changes in plasma volume did not alter the 
interpretation of the results; therefore, the unadjusted 
values are presented for simplicity. Pearson’s product 
moment correlations were used to examine relationships 
between variables. Statistical significance was accepted 
as P < 0.05. Absolute standardised effect sizes (ES) are 
included to supplement important findings. An ES of 
0.2 was considered the minimum important difference 
in all outcome measures, 0.5 moderate and 0.8 large 
(Cohen 1988). Graphical representations of results

Results
Experiment one: exercise intensity
Exercise responses Exercise responses for MOD and 
VIG are shown in Table 2. Exercise duration was 
significantly shorter, and treadmill speed, heart rate, 
RPE and oxygen uptake were all greater in VIG compared 
with MOD (P ≤ 0.05). Respiratory exchange ratio was 
higher in VIG than MOD (P < 0.001). The relative 
contribution of carbohydrate and fat oxidation to 
energy provision was higher and lower, respectively, in 
VIG compared with MOD (both P < 0.001). Gross energy 
expenditure was not significantly different between the 
exercise conditions (P = 0.38).
Hunger 
perceptions Fasting 
hunger 
ratings 
were 
similar 
across 
the 
conditions 
at 
baseline 
(P = 0.50) (Table 3). Linear mixed models revealed no 
 
differences in hunger ratings across the conditions 
(main effect condition P = 0.35; main effect time 
P < 0.001; condition by time interaction P = 0.78) (Fig. 2).

Hunger total AUC was similar across the conditions 
(P = 0.65) (Table 3).
Acylated 
ghrelin, 
glucose 
and 
insulin 
concentrations Boxplot analysis of acylated ghrelin 
total AUC values identified one participant as an outlier 
(Field 2009). This participant exhibited a mean acylated 
ghrelin concentration 21 times greater than the mean SD 
of the remaining participants (range: 74–1489 
pg/mL). 
 
Therefore, this participant was removed, and results are 
presented for eight participants. Fasting acylated ghrelin 
concentrations were similar across the conditions at 
baseline (P 
= 
0.57) (Table 3). Linear mixed models for 
delta acylated ghrelin revealed a significant main effect 
of condition (P 
< 
0.001), time (P 
< 
0.001) and condition 
by time interaction (P 
= 
0.03) (Fig. 2). Post hoc analysis of 
between-condition differences revealed that delta acylated 
ghrelin concentrations were lower than control in MOD 
(ES 
= 
0.44, P 
= 
0.01) and VIG (ES 
= 
0.98, P 
< 
0.001); VIG was 
lower than MOD (ES 
= 
0.54, P 
= 
0.003). Post hoc analysis of 
the condition by time interaction revealed that the delta 
acylated ghrelin concentration was lower than control 
in VIG at 0.5 
h (ES 
= 
5.49, P 
= 
0.005) and 1 
h (ES 
= 
2.46, 
P 
= 
0.02); VIG was lower than MOD at 0.5 
h (ES 
= 
4.68, 
P 
= 
0.02). Delta total AUC for acylated ghrelin was lower in 
VIG compared with control (ES 
= 
2.45, P 
= 
0.01) (Table 3).
Fasting glucose concentrations were similar across the 
conditions at baseline (P 
= 
0.63) (Table 3). Linear mixed 
models for glucose identified a main effect of condition 
(P 
= 
0.02) and time (P 
< 
0.001), but not a condition by 
time interaction (P 
= 
0.46) (Fig. 2). Post hoc analysis of 
between-condition differences revealed that mean VIG 
glucose concentration was 6% and 5% higher than 
control (ES 
= 
0.31, P 
= 
0.02) and MOD (ES 
= 
0.27, P 
= 
0.04), 
respectively; control and MOD were similar (1%; ES 
= 
0.04, 
P 
= 
0.73). The VIG glucose AUC was meaningfully, albeit 
not significantly, higher than control (6%; ES 
= 
0.62, 
P 
= 
0.09) and MOD (6%; ES 
= 
0.58, P 
= 
0.09); control and 
MOD were not different (0%; ES 
= 
0.05, P 
= 
0.86) (Table 3).
Fasting insulin concentrations were similar across 
the conditions at baseline (P 
= 
0.19) (Table 3). No 
differences in insulin concentrations were seen across 
the conditions (main effect condition P 
= 
0.28; main 
effect time P 
< 
0.001; condition by time interaction 
P 
= 
0.26) (Fig. 2). Insulin total AUC was similar across the 
conditions (P 
= 
0.95) (Table 3).
Correlations There were no significant correlations 
between delta acylated ghrelin concentrations and 
changes in hunger, glucose or insulin values.
Experiment two: exercise duration
Exercise responses Exercise responses for EX45 and 
EX90 are displayed in Table 2. The only significant 
difference was the anticipated increase in gross energy 
expenditure for EX90 compared with EX45 (P 
< 
0.001).
Hunger perceptions Fasting hunger ratings were 
similar across the conditions at baseline (P 
= 
0.73) (Table 4). 
Linear mixed models for hunger revealed a significant 
main effect of condition (P 
= 
0.001), time (P 
<

and condition by time interaction (P 
<

Discussion
The purpose of the present experiments was to elucidate 
the effect of exercise intensity and duration on acylated 
ghrelin concentrations and hunger perceptions. The 
primary findings are that isoenergetic vigorous-intensity 
running 
transiently 
suppressed 
acylated 
ghrelin 
concentrations to a greater extent than moderate-
intensity running, but was not accompanied by a change 
in hunger. Furthermore, acylated ghrelin concentrations 
and hunger were suppressed to a similar extent during 
45- and 90-min treadmill running, but the effect appears 
prolonged when the exercise duration is extended.
Research has demonstrated that acute exercise 
suppresses 
acylated 
ghrelin 
concentrations, 
with 
perturbations returning to control values within 30 
min 
after exercise (King et al. 2013, Schubert et al. 2014). 
Experiment one extends these findings by demonstrating 
that acylated ghrelin concentrations were reduced to 
a greater extent during vigorous-intensity running 
than moderate-intensity running, despite a similar 
exercise-induced energy expenditure. This is consistent 
with previous research identifying exercise intensity 
as an important determinant of the acylated ghrelin 
response to acute exercise, with suppression occurring 
at intensities ≥60% V
.O2peak typically (Broom et al. 
2007, 2009, Ueda et al. 2009, King et al. 2010a,b). The 
importance of exercise intensity is highlighted further by 
studies reporting that sprint interval exercise suppresses 
acylated ghrelin to a greater extent than moderate-
intensity exercise (Deighton et al. 2013, Metcalfe et al. 
2015). However, studies directly comparing isoenergetic 
bouts of moderate- and vigorous- to high-intensity 
exercise have reported contrasting findings, with one 
study reporting greater suppression of acylated ghrelin 
at the higher exercise intensity (akin to experiment one) 
(Sim et al. 2014), whereas others demonstrate a similar 
level of suppression independent of exercise intensity 
(Martins et al. 2015, Howe et al. 2016). The discrepancy in 
findings is likely related to key variations in the protocols 
adopted including differences in the participant groups, 
exercise energy expenditure, completion of exercise in the 
fasted or postprandial state and the timing of meal intake. 
Differences in meal size and macronutrient composition 
and methods utilised to quantify acylated ghrelin are 
likely to further confound the interpretation of these 
findings. Additional work is clearly required to elucidate 
the impact of exercise intensity on acylated ghrelin.
Surprisingly, despite the decrease in acylated ghrelin 
during vigorous-intensity exercise, hunger did not differ 
significantly between conditions. Although this contrasts 
previous studies reporting simultaneous reductions in 
acylated ghrelin and hunger in response to exercise 
(Broom et al. 2007, 2009, King et al. 2010a), exercise-
induced changes in acylated ghrelin and hunger do not 
always occur in parallel (Deighton et al. 2013, Sim et al. 
2014, Martins et al. 2015). This apparent disassociation 
highlights the complex nature of appetite regulation, 
which involves the interaction of many physiological and 
psychological factors (Hussain & Bloom 2013).
In accordance with previous studies, experiment two 
demonstrated 
a 
reduction 
in 
acylated 
ghrelin 
concentrations 
and hunger in both exercise conditions (Broom et al. 2007, 
2009, King et al. 2010a). Although the hunger and acylated 
ghrelin responses were not statistically different between 
the two exercise interventions, the values remained 
suppressed at 1.5 
h in the 90-min, but not 45-min, exercise 
bout (Fig. 3). This suggests that increasing the exercise 
duration may extend the exercise-induced suppression in 
hunger and acylated ghrelin concentrations. Although this 
is the first study to investigate the effect of exercise duration 
on acylated ghrelin concentrations, Erdmann et al. (2007) 
reported no differences in total ghrelin concentrations 
in response to 30-, 60- and 120-min cycling. However, 
acylated ghrelin is the form of ghrelin thought to be solely 
responsible for appetite stimulation (Ghigo et al. 2005) 
and may be obscured when total ghrelin is measured 
(Hosoda et al. 2004). Furthermore, research examining the 
effect of acute exercise on total ghrelin concentrations has 
yielded equivocal findings with evidence of acute increases, 
decreases and no change (King et al. 2013).
Similar to experiment one, there was a divergence 
in the acylated ghrelin and hunger responses to acute 
exercise, further highlighting the complexity of appetite 
regulation. Although simultaneous reductions in acylated 
ghrelin and hunger were seen during exercise, hunger 
ratings returned to similar values between conditions at 
2.5 
h, but acylated ghrelin remained suppressed in the 
exercise conditions after meal consumption. The reason 
for this disparity is unclear, but the findings of the present

experiments contribute to the debate concerning the 
importance of reductions in acylated ghrelin as a potential 
determinant of hunger.
The 
physiological 
significance 
of 
transient 
reductions in acylated ghrelin during and after 
exercise is not fully understood. The divergence 
between acylated ghrelin and hunger demonstrated 
in the present experiments and previous studies 
(Deighton et al. 2013, Sim et al. 2014, Martins et al. 
2015) challenges the role that acylated ghrelin plays in 
mediating appetite responses to exercise. Furthermore, 
although the implementation of standardised meals in 
the present experiments precluded the assessment of 
energy intake, the consensus of evidence suggests that 
acute aerobic exercise does not stimulate compensatory 
increases in appetite and energy intake on the same 
day (Deighton & Stensel 2014). This may point to the 
existence of alternative compensatory mechanisms; 
for example, reductions in unstructured physical 
activity (i.e., non-exercise activity thermogenesis) 
and/or increased sedentary behaviours on the day of 
exercise, but further work is required to support this. 
Nevertheless, acylated ghrelin is the only gut peptide 
known to stimulate appetite and energy intake, with 
circulating concentrations increasing preprandially 
and decreasing postprandially on a meal-to-meal basis 
(Cummings et al. 2004). Consequently, this temporal 
pattern of fluctuation in acylated ghrelin is indicative 
of an important role in coordinating meal initiation 
and/or termination (Cummings et al. 2004, Karra & 
Batterham 2010).
The 
mechanisms 
underpinning 
the 
transient 
exercise-induced suppression of acylated ghrelin are 
unclear but are likely to reflect processes interfering 
with the synthesis and/or secretion of acylated ghrelin 
into the circulation. A recent review suggests that the 
redistribution of blood flow from splanchnic areas to 
active skeletal muscle may be particularly pertinent 
for suppressing ghrelin and appears to be dependent 
on the exercise intensity (Hazell et al. 2016). Exercise-
induced changes in glucose and insulin concentrations 
have also been implicated mechanistically (Hazell et al. 
2016), with elevations associated with decreased ghrelin 
concentrations (Flanagan et al. 2003, Cummings & 
Overduin 2007, Iwakura et al. 2015). The elevation in 
glucose concentration during vigorous-intensity exercise 
in experiment one and both exercise conditions in 
experiment two coincided with the reduction in acylated 
ghrelin concentrations. However, insulin concentrations 
were reduced in the 90-min exercise condition, and 
previous exercise studies provide conflicting findings by 
reporting no effect of glucose and insulin on acylated 
ghrelin concentrations (Broom et al. 2007, 2009). 
Further research is required to develop a mechanistic 
understanding of the exercise-induced suppression of 
acylated ghrelin.
One 
limitation 
of 
the 
present 
experiments 
represents the measurement of a single appetite-
regulating hormone. Despite the unique role of 
acylated ghrelin as the only appetite-stimulating gut 
hormone, it is only one component of the appetite-
regulating neuroendocrine system. Therefore, it may be 
prudent for future studies to investigate anorexigenic 
hormones (e.g., peptide-YY, glucagon-like peptide-1, 
pancreatic polypeptide and cholecystokinin) to provide 
a broader scientific understanding of the role exercise 
intensity and duration play in modulating appetite 
regulation. Secondly, appetite perceptions were limited 
to the assessment of hunger; however, utilising multiple 
scales (e.g., satisfaction, fullness and prospective food 
consumption) may provide a more holistic insight into 
appetite perceptions (Blundell et al. 2010). Finally, we 
recruited a small group of healthy and recreationally 
active men to both experiments, which may limit 
applications to other population groups and the ability 
to detect meaningful associations between variables. 
Additional research is needed in overweight and obese 
populations who are most likely to benefit from weight 
management strategies. Despite these limitations, our 
findings provide important insight into the role that 
exercise intensity and duration play in modulating 
hormonal and hunger responses to exercise.
In conclusion, the present experiments demonstrate 
that exercise intensity, and to a lesser extent, duration, 
are determinants of the acylated ghrelin response to 
exercise. Acylated ghrelin is transiently suppressed after 
a bout of exercise, an effect that appears greater when 
exercise is performed at a higher intensity. Increasing the 
exercise duration may prolong the transient suppression 
in hunger and acylated ghrelin, but the disassociation 
between hunger and acylated ghrelin responses requires 
further investigation. Future research is warranted to 
examine these responses chronically and in overweight/
obese populations for whom exercise may be a therapeutic 
strategy for weight management.
