Abstract
Aims/hypothesis We aimed to examine the effects of breaking
sitting with standing and light-intensity walking vs an
energy-matched bout of structured exercise on 24 h glucose
levels and insulin resistance in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods In a randomised crossover study, 19 patients with
type 2 diabetes (13 men/6 women, 63±9 years old) who were
not using insulin each followed three regimens under
free-living conditions, each lasting 4 days: (1) Sitting: 4415
steps/day with 14 h sitting/day; (2) Exercise: 4823 steps/day
with 1.1 h/day of sitting replaced by moderate- to
vigorous-intensity cycling (at an intensity of 5.9 metabolic
equivalents [METs]); and (3) Sit Less: 17,502 steps/day with
4.7 h/day of sitting replaced by standing and light-intensity
walking (an additional 2.5 h and 2.2 h, respectively, compared
with the hours spent doing these activities in the Sitting
regimen). Blocked randomisation was performed using a block
size of six regimen orders using sealed, non-translucent
envelopes. Individuals who assessed the outcomes were
blinded to group assignment. Meals were standardised during
each intervention. Physical activity and glucose levels were
assessed for 24 h/day by accelerometry (activPAL) and a
glucose monitor (iPro2), respectively. The incremental AUC
(iAUC) for 24 h glucose (primary outcome) and insulin
resistance (HOMA2-IR) were assessed on days 4 and 5,
respectively.
Results The iAUC for 24 h glucose (mean ± SEM) was
significantly lower during the Sit Less intervention than in
Sitting (1263±189 min×mmol/l vs 1974±324 min×mmol/l;
p=0.002), and was similar between Sit Less and Exercise
(Exercise: 1383±194 min×mmol/l; p=0.499). Exercise failed
to improve HOMA2-IR compared with Sitting (2.06±0.28 vs
2.16 ± 0.26; p = 0.177). In contrast, Sit Less (1.89 ± 0.26)
significantly reduced HOMA2-IR compared with Exercise
(p=0.015) as well as Sitting (p=0.001).
Conclusions/interpretation Breaking sitting with standing
and light-intensity walking effectively improved 24 h glucose
levels and improved insulin sensitivity in individuals with
type 2 diabetes to a greater extent than structured exercise.
Thus, our results suggest that breaking sitting with standing
and light-intensity walking may be an alternative to structured
exercise to promote glycaemic control in patients type 2
diabetes.

Introduction
Moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise is one of the
cornerstones of prevention and treatment of type 2 diabetes
[1, 2], with current physical activity guidelines recommending
performance of at least 150 min/week exercise at these
intensities [3]. Although this approach has proved effective
in the prevention [4] and treatment [5] of type 2 diabetes, more
than 90% of healthy adults do not adhere to these guidelines
[6]. In view of type 2 diabetes-related comorbidities such as
muscle weakness and peripheral neuropathy, which can be a
barrier to physical activity [7], non-compliance may be even
higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Alternatives to
exercise are therefore needed for the treatment of type 2
diabetes.
The results of population-based studies suggest that the
average adult spends more than half of the waking day
sedentary, partaking in activities such as watching television
and using the computer [8–10]. Recent evidence from
observational studies shows an association between sedentary
time and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, independent of
the time spent exercising [8, 10]. Experimental studies under
laboratory conditions suggest that regular interruption of
sitting using small bouts of walking may be effective in
lowering glucose and insulin levels in healthy and
overweight/obese adults and in individuals with type 2
diabetes [11–15]. We recently showed that replacing sitting
time with standing and light-intensity walking in free-living
conditions was more efficient at improving insulin action than
replacement with one bout of moderate- to vigorous-intensity
exercise (cycling) in healthy sedentary participants [16]. Since
energy expenditure was comparable by design during these
two conditions, these data suggest that sitting has negative
effects on insulin sensitivity independent of energy
expenditure.
To investigate whether these findings could be replicated in
individuals with type 2 diabetes, we investigated whether,
under conditions of comparable energy expenditure, breaking
up sitting time with standing and light-intensity walking
would improve 24 h glucose levels and insulin sensitivity in
type 2 diabetes patients as compared with structured exercise.
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the
glycaemic effects of breaking up sitting time in people with
type 2 diabetes in free-living conditions.
Methods
Participants Adults with type 2 diabetes (minimum duration
of 1 year), aged 40–75 years and with a BMI of 25–35 kg/m2,
were recruited through online and paper advertisements.
Exclusion criteria were more than 2.5 h/week of
moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise based on self-report,
diseases that interfered with physical activity participation,
alcohol abuse, experimental drug use and use of insulin,
corticosteroids, coumarins or immunosuppressants.
Participants were instructed to discontinue lipid-lowering
drugs and cholesterol-lowering margarines 14 days prior to
starting the first regimen. Use of other drugs was continued
and maintained at the same dose during the study. Other
exclusion criteria were fasting triacylglycerol >10 mmol/l,
fasting plasma glucose ≥11 mmol/l or HbA1c >10%
(86 mmol/mol). All participants provided written informed
consent. The study was conducted at Maastricht University
between February and May 2015 in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and was approved
by the Local Ethics Committee of the Maastricht University
Medical Centre+ (www.clinicaltrials.gov registration no.
NCT02371239).
Study design The study used a randomised crossover design,
and the analysis of the primary and secondary outcomes was
performed without knowledge of which activity regimen the
participant had been allocated to. Blocked randomisation was
performed using a block size of six regimen orders using
sealed, non-translucent envelopes.
The number of participants required to detect a clinically
relevant difference in 24 h glucose profiles between the
activity regimens was calculated based on a similar study
[17] with three study arms (sedentary, low-intensity exercise
and high-intensity exercise), in which the mean±SD 24 h
glucose was 8.7 ± 2.1 mmol/l during the high-intensity
exercise regimen. Using these data, and assuming equal SDs
in each of our regimens, a correlation between repeated
measurements of 0.5 and a Bonferroni corrected two-sided
alpha of 0.017 (=0.05/3), it was calculated that 19 participants
were needed to detect a mean difference of 1.7 mmol/l in 24 h
glucose between the activity regimens, with a power of 80%,
using a paired-samples t test.
Activity regimens All participants were instructed to follow
three activity regimens (‘Sitting’, ‘Exercise’ and ‘Sit Less’;
see Fig. 1). The order of intervention was randomised and
Diabetologia (2017) 60:490–498
491
 each regimen lasted 4 days and was carried out in free-living
conditions. During the Sitting regimen, participants were
instructed to restrict walking to 1 h/day and standing to 1 h/
day while spending the remainder of the waking day (∼14 h)
sitting. During the Exercise regimen, about 1 h/day of sitting
time was replaced with supervised cycling on an ergometer
(Lode Excalibur, Groningen, the Netherlands) at our research
centre. To increase the feasibility of the exercise, cycling was
performed in the morning at least 2 h after breakfast to prevent
(abdominal) discomfort during cycling. Cycling was carried
out in 20 min bouts with a 5 min rest (sitting) after each bout.
In the Sit Less regimen, participants were instructed to replace
approximately 5 h/day sitting with 2 h walking and 3 h
standing. Participants were instructed to break up their sitting
time, preferably every 30 min, by dividing the walking/
standing activities into smaller bouts over the day. They were
instructed to walk at a self-perceived light-intensity.
Importantly, adherence to these instructions was carefully
monitored by advanced accelerometry (see below).
Awash-out period of at least 10 days between the screening
session and the first activity regimen, and between successive
activity regimens, was applied. During the wash-out phase,
participants were instructed to maintain their habitual pattern
of daily life activities, not to perform more than 1 h/week of
moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise and to consume a
maximum of 1 unit/day of alcohol.
Meal standardisation During the first 60 h of each regimen,
participants were instructed to adhere to their normal diet.
During the last 36 h of each regimen, standardised
pre-packaged meals were provided based on the individual’s
basal metabolic rate, and matched to each individual’s daily
energy requirements (this was calculated by multiplying the
basal metabolic rate [determined during screening using a
ventilated hood] by 1.4 [reflective of the physical activity level
of a sedentary lifestyle]) [18]. During the first regimen,
participants carefully recorded everything they ate and drank,
as well as the timing of consumptions. Subsequently, these
records were returned to the participants, who were instructed
to consume the same diet at the same time points during the
following two regimens. Alcohol was not permitted during
regimen participation.
Assessment of 24 h glucose, insulin resistance and lipids
During the activity regimens, glucose levels were
continuously measured (24 h/day) with a glucose monitor
(iPro2 Professional CGM MiniMed; Medtronic, Northridge,
CA, USA) connected to a glucose sensor (Enlite Glucose
Sensor MiniMed; Medtronic). The sensor was inserted
subcutaneously on the first morning of each regimen, at
5 cm from the umbilicus, on the right side of the abdomen.
To investigate the cumulative effects of the 4 day activity
regimens, 24 h glucose levels were only analysed on day 4;
therefore, standardised meals were provided by the research
team for dinner on day 3 and for all meals and snacks during
day 4.
Glucose concentration was measured in the interstitial fluid
of the subcutaneous tissue every 5 min via the iPro2.
Additionally, participants collected blood glucose
measurements four times per day (before main meals and
before sleep) using a capillary glucose meter (Accu-Chek;
Roche Diagnostics India, Mumbai, India), which were used
for calibration at the time of iPro2 data upload. On the day
after the 4 day regimen, following an overnight fast, blood
was collected for glucose, insulin and lipid measurements.
For each participant, blood was procured at the exact same
time during each regimen (between 08:30 and 09:30 hours).
Assessment of physical activity and estimated energy
expenditure Physical activity was measured 24 h/day using
an activPAL3 monitor (PAL Technologies, Glasgow,
Scotland). The activPAL was waterproofed with a small
sleeve to cover the monitor, wrapped in one piece of
medical-grade adhesive dressing (Tegaderm; 3M, Saint Paul,
MN, USA) and then attached to the anterior thigh using
Tegaderm (3M) on the first morning of each activity regimen.
As the activPAL data from day 1 did not cover the entire day,
only activPAL data from the last 72 h of each regimen were

(3) Sit Less: 4.7 h/day of sitting

light-intensity walking (2.2 h),

 analysed. This accelerometer accurately discriminates
between time spent inactive (sitting or lying), standing and
walking [19], giving step number and cadence [20]. Diary
data for self-reported physical activity were compared with
the activPAL data after the first and third days of each activity
regimen to formulate tailor-made instructions on how to alter
daily activities in order to guarantee optimal compliance with
each activity regimen. Time spent sleeping was determined
based on the diary data.
Daily energy expenditure was estimated using the 24 h
activPAL data, which yielded this information as metabolic
equivalents (METs). The measurement error of the activPAL
in estimating this energy expenditure has been reported to be
low for sedentary and light-intensity activities but high for
moderate- and vigorous-intensity activities [21]. Thus, the
Compendium of Physical Activities [22] was used to
determine the energy expenditure of cycling by generating a
linear regression line from studies in the compendium that
provided MET values over a range of workloads
representative of the population in our study. Consequently,
the energy expenditure of cycling was determined using the
following equation: MET = 0.0545 × watt + 1.4561;
R2 = 0.946, using each participant’s workload in watts to
determine individual energy expenditure. The Exercise and
Sit Less regimens were designed to have comparable energy
expenditure. To achieve this, during screening, every
individual performed a 1 day try-out of the Sit Less regimen
in free-living conditions, a maximal workload capacity
(Wmax) test (a progressive cycle test until exhaustion while
cardiac function was monitored) and an additional 1 h
supervised cycle test, each on separate days. Estimated energy
expenditure, as derived from the activPAL data during the Sit
Less try-out day, was used as the input for computing the
duration (∼1 h) and workload (50–60% Wmax) for cycling
during the Exercise regimen. Normal daily activities were
measured 13 days prior to the start of the study (‘day −13’)
and participants were asked not to cycle on this day.
Data processing and statistical analysis All data were
double-entered. The continuous glucose monitoring data were
analysed using an iPro2 (Medtronic). The last 24 h of each
regimen, starting with the first fingerprick before breakfast,
were chosen for analysis of the 24 h glucose levels since meals
were identical between interventions during this period. Mean
24 h glucose concentration was defined as the average glucose
of 288 measurements equally spaced in time. The incremental
AUC (iAUC) for glucose was calculated using the trapezoid
rule [23]. The iAUC provides a summary measure of the
increase above fasting glucose level during the subsequent
24 h observation period. A secondary outcome was total
AUC (all values above zero). Hyperglycaemia was defined
as a glucose level of ≥10.0 mmol/l, whilst hypoglycaemia
was defined as a glucose concentration ≤3.9 mmol/l plus
clinical symptoms.
To examine whether bouts of cycling or walking resulted in
a rapid decrease in glucose levels, the average glucose
decrease during each 30 min time frame was calculated using
continuous glucose monitoring, resulting in 288 values over
24 h.
The HOMA2 computational method (www.dtu.ox.ac.uk,
accessed 1 December 2015) [24] was used to estimate
insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) using fasting plasma glucose
and insulin values measured on the day after completion of the
4 day regimen.
All statistical calculations were performed using IBM
SPSS Statistics for Windows (Version 21; Armonk NY,
USA). The differences in outcome between regimens were
analysed using linear mixed model analyses with activity
regimen and period (order of activity regimen) as fixed
factors, and an unstructured covariance structure for the three
repeated measurements for each person. Natural log
transformation was performed if the outcome was not
normally distributed. Likelihood-based methods were used
without imputing missing outcome values. Numerical
variables are presented as mean ± SD, or as median (first
quartile, third quartile) for baseline characteristics (measured
during screening) and estimated mean (SEM) for the other
values. A p value of ≤0.05 was considered statistically
significant. When regimens were compared pairwise, p values
≤0.017 (=0.05/3, Bonferroni correction) were considered
statistically significant to account for multiple testing (three
pairwise comparisons).
Results
After screening, 20 participants (14 men, six women) were
included in the study (see electronic supplementary material
[ESM] Fig. 1 for recruitment flow chart). Before completing
the protocol, one participant withdrew because of
osteoarthritis-related pain during walking. The remaining 19
individuals had a mean age of 63 years and a mean BMI of
30.5 kg/m2 (Table 1). The median duration of type 2 diabetes
was 6 years and participants had a mean HbA1c of 6.7%
(49.5 mmol/mol) and mean fasting plasma glucose of
7.88 mmol/l during screening (Table 1). Fourteen participants
were using oral glucose-lowering drugs (metformin, n=14;
sulfonylurea, n = 7; sitagliptin, n = 2), and 13 were using
lipid-lowering drugs (statins, n=12; ezetimibe, n=2).
Continuous glucose monitoring In the Sit Less regimen,
substitution of time spent sitting by ambulatory time
significantly reduced 24 h glucose levels compared with
Sitting (mean [SEM] Sit Less vs Sitting: 7.35 [0.19] vs 7.69
[0.23] mmol/l; p=0.014; Figs 2 and 3a). In contrast, 24 h
Diabetologia (2017) 60:490–498
493
 glucose levels were not significantly different between Sit
Less and the more classical Exercise regimen, involving
structured exercise (Exercise: 7.29 [0.24] mmol/l; p=0.741).
Similar results were obtained for total AUC (Table 2). Sit Less
profoundly reduced glucose levels (by approximately 36%)
compared with the Sitting regimen; i.e. the iAUC for 24 h
glucose levels reduced significantly from 1974 (324)
min × mmol/l in the Sitting regimen, to 1263 (189)
min×mmol/l in the Sit Less regimen (p=0.002; Figs 2 and
3a). Glucose excursion (iAUC) for 24 h glucose was similar
between Sit Less and Exercise (p = 0.499). Although
structured exercise also reduced the 24 h glucose excursion
(iAUC 1383 [194] min×mmol/l; p=0.069) compared with
Sitting, this effect was not significant and, hence, less
pronounced than in the Sit Less regimen.
While chronic elevated glucose levels are associated with
adverse health effects, the frequency and duration of
hyperglycaemia (min/day that blood glucose is ≥10 mmol/l)
may be of even more relevance in a clinical setting [25]. The
duration of hyperglycaemia over a 24 h time span was almost
halved (Fig. 3c), from 211 (44) min/day in the Sitting regimen
to 118 (32) min/day in the Sit Less regimen (p=0.002). Again,
intermediate results were observed for the Exercise regimen,
with the duration of hyperglycaemia averaging 152 (30) min/
day. Although no hypoglycaemic periods were observed
during any of the regimens, the maximal fall in glucose within
30 min differed between experimental regimens (Fig. 3d). As
anticipated, the maximal drop in glucose over 30 min during
structured exercise (−5.28 [0.39] mmol l−1 h−1) was larger
than during the Sitting regimen (−4.15 [0.31] mmol l−1 h−1;
p=0.016). Importantly, the maximal blood glucose reduction
observed in the Sit Less regimen (−4.69 [0.39] mmol l−1 h−1)
was not significantly different from that observed after Sitting
(p=0.119), indicating that the Sit Less regimen is unlikely to
increase the risk of experienced hypoglycaemia.
Insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) and plasma lipids Fasting
insulin levels in the Exercise regimen were similar to those in
the Sitting regimen (102 [14] vs 108 [13] pmol/l, respectively;
p = 0.117). In contrast, compared with Sitting, Sit Less
significantly (p=0.001) reduced fasting insulin levels to 95
[14] pmol/l). Since no significant differences were observed in
mean glucose values after Sit Less as compared with Exercise
(Table 2), this finding suggests that Sit Less, but not Exercise,
improved insulin sensitivity. Likewise, Sit Less resulted in
significantly lower HOMA2-IR values vs Sitting (1.89
[0.26] vs 2.16 [0.26]; p = 0.001) and vs Exercise (2.06
[0.28]; p=0.015), whereas Exercise failed to improve this
measure of insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3b) compared with the
Sitting regime (p=0.177).
Both Sit Less (1.46 [0.12] mmol/l and Exercise (1.55 [0.14]
mmol/l) resulted in significantly lower fasting triacylglycerol
levels than were observed after Sitting (1.93 [0.17] mmol/l;
both p<0.01). We also observed that after both Sit Less and
Exercise, fasting plasma NEFA levels were significantly
higher (Sit Less 0.59 [0.04] mmol/l, p=0.012; Exercise 0.65
[0.06] mmol/l, p = 0.017) than after Sitting (0.48 [0.05]
mmol/l). Cholesterol-related variables and free glycerol were
not significantly different between any of the regimens (Table 2).
Physical activity and diet Before the start of the study, the
average time spent walking, standing and sitting/sleeping in
free-living conditions (n=16 individuals; activPAL data were
not available for three participants) was 1.4 (0.2), 3.6 (0.5) and
18.9 (0.6) h/day, respectively (data not shown). During each
regimen, we successfully manipulated the time spent sitting,

 walking, standing and cycling so that they were close to the
times stipulated for each activity/regimen in the protocol
(Table 3). During Sit Less, the times spent walking
(∼3 h/day) and standing (∼4 h/day) were significantly longer
than in the other regimens, whereas Sitting and Exercise were
not significantly different with respect to the time spent
walking (∼1 h/day) and standing (∼1.6 h/day). During the
Exercise regimen, on average 65 (3) min of sitting per day
were substituted by cycling at an intensity of 81 (4) W,
corresponding to a mean of 5.9 (0.2) MET. Walking cadence
was 93 (2) steps/min during Sit Less and 83 (2) and 84 (2)
during Sitting and Exercise, respectively (Table 3). By design,
estimated energy expenditure was lower in the Sitting regimen
(32.0 [0.1] MET×h/day) than in any of the other regimens
(36.9 [0.2] and 37.4 [0.2] MET×h/day for Exercise and Sit
Less, respectively; Table 3). There was, however, an estimated
0.5 MET×h/day difference between Exercise and Sit Less
(p=0.008; Table 3). Energy intake did not differ significantly
between the regimens (p=0.599 during activity regimens and
p=0.953 during the last day of each activity regimen) and
neither did the percentage macronutrients consumed (Table 3
and ESM Table 1).

 Discussion
Structured exercise is a recognised cornerstone of type 2
diabetes treatment and prevention. However, sustained
compliance with exercise programmes, especially by
individuals with type 2 diabetes, is at best mediocre [26, 27].
Observational studies have revealed associations between the
time spent sitting and markers of metabolic disturbance
[8–10]. Therefore, reducing the sitting time may improve
glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity in type 2 diabetes.
Strategies to reduce sitting time are generally considered to be
less demanding than structured exercise programmes and
hence are more likely to have long-term compliance [28]. In
this study, we observed that the Sit Less regimen improved
insulin sensitivity, mean 24 h glucose levels, 24 h glucose
excursions, duration of hyperglycaemia (blood glucose
≥10 mmol/l) and fasting triacylglycerol levels.
We used a proof-of-concept study to determine the relative
efficacy of reducing sitting time or increasing structured
exercise. As a result, the number of steps during Sit Less
(around 17,500 steps/day) was well above what is generally
observed in patients with type 2 diabetes (around 6500–8000
steps/day) [7, 29] and, therefore, the duration/intensity of
exercise was also high (65 min/day cycling at 5.9 MET) and
probably not sustainable on a long-term basis. The beneficial
effects of Sit Less were observed in participants with type 2
diabetes, the majority of whom were men using oral
glucose-lowering medication (the use of which was continued
throughout the study duration). Subanalyses showed similar
improvements in 24 h glucose iAUC during Sit Less in
participants who were not taking glucose-lowering
medication (n=5), as well as for women only (n=6).
The outcome of the present study fits the emerging picture
that breaking up sedentary behaviour by light-intensity
activities may help to improve glucose homeostasis in
groups, ranging from young lean normoglycaemic individuals
[16] to overweight/obese normoglycaemic [13] and
dysglycaemic [14] participants. Very recently, Dempsey et al
showed that breaking up sitting time with brief bouts of
light-intensity walking or resistance exercise attenuates
postprandial glucose and insulin responses in type 2 diabetes
[12]. In the current study, the general effect of the Sit Less
regimen on glucose homeostasis tended to be a little more
potent than the effect of structured exercise. One of the effects
of acute exercise on elevated blood glucose in diabetes is a
post-exercise reduction in glucose levels; this can sometimes
result in hypoglycaemia and can render some diabetic patients
reluctant to perform structured exercise. In our study, the Sit
Less regimen did not result in glucose level reductions at
30 min compared with the Sitting regimen, whereas 30 min
glucose levels fell by more than 5 mmol l−1 h−1 during the
Exercise regimen. These data suggest that more stable glucose
levels can be achieved with light-intensity activity rather than
with exercise.
For most variables, other than 24 h glucose, the structured
exercise regimen (Exercise) had beneficial effects. The effect
size of Exercise, however, was typically intermediate
compared with the effects of Sit Less and was only greater
for the increases observed in fasting plasma NEFA levels vs
Sitting. These results are in line with a recent study by Henson

 et al showing that breaking up sitting time with walking or
standing increased NEFA levels in overweight/obese
postmenopausal women [14]. Although the mechanism
underlying the increase in NEFA concentration after Sit Less
and Exercise is incompletely understood, it probably reflects a
spill-over of fatty acids from increased adipose tissue lipolysis
used to fuel contractile activity. Upon cessation of contractile
activity, the amount of fatty acids taken up by the muscle for
oxidation decreases more promptly than the catecholamine-
induced elevation of adipose tissue lipolysis, resulting in
elevated plasma NEFA levels [30]. In contrast to our previous
study in healthy volunteers [16], we failed to observe
significant effects on cholesterol levels in individuals with
type 2 diabetes. The most likely explanation for this apparent
discrepancy is the fact that participants stopped lipid-lowering
medication 2 weeks prior to the study, a period that may have
been too short.
Both Sit Less and Exercise resulted in lower fasting
plasma triacylglycerol levels, which may be the result of
increased triacylglycerol clearance due to enhanced
lipoprotein lipase activity [31]. These observed lower
triacylglycerol levels after physical activity are in line with
previous [16, 31] but not all [15] studies. In the latter study,
however, triacylglycerol levels were probably measured
too soon after exercise, as lipoprotein lipase activity
typically peaks ≥8 h post exercise.
In line with our previous study in healthy individuals [16],
we observed that insulin sensitivity was more greatly
improved after the Sit Less regimen than after the Exercise
regimen. This finding may seem surprising given the high
dose of exercise (65 min/day cycling at an intensity of 5.9
MET). It is possible that HOMA-IR was not accurate enough
to detect relatively small changes in insulin sensitivity after
Exercise. However, it should be noted that, during the
Exercise regimen, participants spent most of the day sitting.
We observed similar findings in healthy individuals [16] and
we therefore suggest that one bout of exercise probably cannot
fully compensate for the negative effects of sitting for the rest
of the day. Thus, the duration of non-sitting activities may be
more important than the intensity of these activities. Since the
participants were instructed to break up sitting time every
30 min, this may have contributed to the beneficial effects
observed during Sit Less in comparison with Exercise.
However, the activPAL programme did not provide
information on the duration of sitting bouts; therefore, this
behavioural outcome could not be well assessed. Energy
expenditure was expressed in METs by the activPAL; for the
sake of comparison, we also converted the external workload
on the stationary bike to MET values. Although we appreciate
that the conversion of measured power output to predicted
MET values is a proxy for the actual energy expenditure, we
believe that this method is valid when it comes to comparing
the energy expenditure in Sit Less with Exercise.
In conclusion, this study suggests that breaking up sitting
time by promoting time spent standing and light-intensity
walking is a potent way to beneficially affect insulin resistance
and other clinically relevant markers of glucose metabolism,
and plasma triacylglycerols in individuals with type 2 diabetes
who are taking oral glucose-lowering medication. Although
an approximate energy-matched intervention with structured
exercise also displayed most of the beneficial effects of
breaking up sitting time, the present study provides
indications favouring the implementation of interventions
targeting the breaking-up of sitting time over interventions
involving structured exercise. The effect of breaking up sitting
time on insulin resistance was more pronounced than that of
structured exercise. Additionally, the more abrupt and
prominent reduction in blood glucose in the structured
exercise intervention is proposed to increase the risk of
hypoglycaemia [32]. Since the volume of activities in this
proof-of-concept study was high, future long-term studies
are needed to determine the volume of light-intensity activities
that is feasible in daily life.
