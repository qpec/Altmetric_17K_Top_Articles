Abstract
Pregnancy and parturition are intricately regulated to ensure successful reproductive out-
comes. However, the factors that control gestational length in humans and other anthropoid
primates remain poorly defined. Here, we show the endogenous retroviral long terminal
repeat transposon-like human element 1B (THE1B) selectively controls placental expres-
sion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) that, in turn, influences gestational length
and birth timing. Placental expression of CRH and subsequently prolonged gestational
length were found in two independent strains of transgenic mice carrying a 180-kb human
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) DNA that contained the full length of CRH and
extended flanking regions, including THE1B. Restricted deletion of THE1B silenced placen-
tal CRH expression and normalized birth timing in these transgenic lines. Furthermore, we
revealed an interaction at the 50 insertion site of THE1B with distal-less homeobox 3 (DLX3),
a transcription factor expressed in placenta. Together, these findings suggest that retroviral
insertion of THE1B into the anthropoid primate genome may have initiated expression of
CRH in placental syncytiotrophoblasts via DLX3 and that this placental CRH is sufficient to
alter the timing of birth.
Author summary
The proper timing of delivery is critical during pregnancy; if too early or too late, the baby
will be at risk of serious health problems and even death. Corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone (CRH) is a protein that can be detected in maternal blood, and its concentration
correlates with the timing of birth. In humans and other anthropoid primates, CRH is

 made by the placenta, whereas in other mammals, it is produced in a specialized region of
the brain. To understand the regulation and evolution of this key protein, we inserted the
human CRH gene and nearby regions into the mouse genome, which resulted in human
CRH expression in the mouse placenta. Mouse litters that make CRH in their placentas
are born later than control mice, showing that CRH can directly affect birth timing. Using
our mouse model, we then selectively deleted a remnant of an ancient retrovirus that is
normally found in the DNA of anthropoid primates and demonstrated that this specific
region controls expression of CRH in the placenta. Deletion of this region also restored
normal birth timing in the mice by eliminating CRH production from the placenta. We
propose that retroviral regulation of CRH in the placenta may be a mechanism of control-
ling birth timing in humans and other anthropoid primates.
Introduction
The complex process of completing gestation and initiating parturition must be tightly con-
trolled to prevent the dangerous consequences of preterm or postterm birth to the mother and
offspring. In humans, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) production by the placenta
increases exponentially with gestational age, predicting the onset of parturition [1]. This expo-
nential increase in placental CRH production has been observed earlier in the pregnancy when
that pregnancy was destined to end in preterm birth and later in the pregnancy for postterm
birth, indicating that placental CRH may play a role in the timing and onset of labor [1–4].
The peptide hormone CRH has a well-characterized role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis that is highly conserved in vertebrates [5]. However, its expression in the placenta
is observed only in anthropoid primate species, consistent with evolutionary changes in pla-
cental gene regulation [6–14]. One major driver of evolutionary diversity in gene regulation is
the class of mobile DNA sequences known as transposable elements [15, 16]. Recent advances
in genome sequencing, high-throughput screening for active chromatin, and computational
resources facilitating comparative genomic analysis have made it possible to identify lineage-
specific DNA sequences with signs of regulatory activity, many of which are derived from
transposable elements [17–21].
In a recent study, species-specific enhancers active in early placental development were
found to be highly enriched for long terminal repeats (LTRs), a subset of transposable elements
derived from retroviruses [22]. LTR regions of retroviruses utilize available host factors to
recruit transcription machinery and produce virus, and isolated LTRs have been reported to
function as promoters or enhancers of the host’s genes [23–28]. To understand whether simi-
lar co-option of LTRs into the host’s function has occurred in placental regulation of CRH
expression, we examined the vicinity of the CRH gene for elements that are conserved in
anthropoid primates but not present in species without placental CRH expression. We identi-
fied a retroviral LTR element of the transposon-like human element 1B (THE1B) family,
which invaded the anthropoid primate genome approximately 50 million years ago [29]. We
hypothesized that the introduction of this retroviral LTR element into the genome of anthro-
poid primate common ancestors initiated expression of CRH in placental tissue. Here, we
tested this hypothesis by introducing the human CRH locus into transgenic mouse lines and
selectively editing regions of a nearby THE1B LTR element to control the expression of
human CRH in mouse placental tissue. We show that this LTR element interacts with distal-
less homeobox 3 (DLX3), a transcription factor (TF) required for placental development [30].
Transgenic mice expressing human CRH in their placentas exhibited significant changes in

Results
CRH expression and retroviral element THE1B presence are concordant in
anthropoid primate placenta
Because CRH is expressed in placenta of anthropoid primate species only, we hypothesized
that any potential regulatory DNA sequence would be conserved only in the anthropoid pri-
mate lineage. We compared the genomes of 12 anthropoid primates, 3 prosimians, and 3 non-
primate mammals in the region of CRH and identified an endogenous retroviral LTR of the
THE1B type that correlated with placental CRH expression (Fig 1A). THE1B LTR elements
have been shown to activate transcription under certain conditions [31, 32]. To determine
activity of this THE1B element in anthropoid primate placenta, we utilized a PCR screening
system to amplify transcripts containing both THE1B and the coding exon of CRH from pla-
cental tissue. Both human and rhesus macaque placentas expressed a detectable fusion tran-
script with an identical splice junction connecting sequence downstream of THE1B to
noncoding exon 1 of CRH (Fig 1B). This novel splice junction is conserved in the primate spe-
cies included in Fig 1A, suggesting a possible role for THE1B as a regulatory element of CRH
in the placenta (S1 Table). The THE1B-CRH fusion transcript was detectable by PCR screen-
ing but not detectable by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from term human placenta, indicating
low abundance relative to total CRH expression (Fig 1B). To better detect potential
THE1B-CRH fusion transcripts, we utilized a capture sequencing approach in which we first
enriched for cDNAs containing THE1B elements using a library of biotinylated complemen-
tary RNA probes that could be pulled down with streptavidin beads prior to deep sequencing.
Despite obtaining greater than 1,000-fold enrichment of THE1B-containing transcripts, we
remained unable to detect any chimeric reads linking THE1B and CRH. In contrast, we found
abundant reads transcribed in the antisense direction through the THE1B element (Fig 1B).
Because these reads are unidirectional and within 2 kb of the CRH promoter region, it is likely
that these reads were initiated from a bidirectional CRH promoter. In sum, the comparative
genomics and RNA-seq data led us to hypothesize that the anthropoid-specific THE1B ele-
ment serves as an enhancer, not an alternative promoter, of the CRH gene.
THE1B LTRs may form a coordinated regulatory network in anthropoid
primate placenta
Previous studies have implicated endogenous retroviral LTR elements as promoters and
enhancers that drive placenta-specific gene expression [22, 33–38]. To examine the effect of
THE1B LTRs on placental expression of genes, including CRH, we first defined a set of genes
that had a THE1B element within 10 kb of the transcription start site. This set of THE1B-asso-
ciated genes contained 2,311 gene–THE1B pairings, encompassing about 10% of THE1B ele-
ments in the human genome. We then compared the expression pattern of THE1B-associated
genes across different tissues using a relative coexpression analysis as described by Pavlicev
and colleagues [33]. Briefly, the analysis was run on all expressed genes and tested whether the
THE1B-associated genes were equally correlated in their expression between a focal tissue and
each of 17 other tissues than expected for a random size-matched subset of THE1B-unassoci-
ated genes. Consistently lower correlations in all tests involving a tissue of interest imply that
some feature of THE1B-associated genes confers the particular expression status in that partic-
ular tissue, and in fact, the relative coexpression of THE1B-associated genes in tests involving

 placenta was significantly lower than for a random gene set (Fig 1C). An association between a
THE1D element and placental expression of a single gene has been reported [39]; however,
Pavlicev and colleagues found no change in relative coexpression of genes associated with
other THE1 family members in placenta [33].
In a second analysis, we quantified gene expression from RNA-seq of human and mouse
tissues to identify genes with human-specific, placenta-enriched gene expression. We then
examined whether these differentially expressed genes were enriched for THE1B elements
within 20 kb of their promoters relative to a control set of genes. Indeed, we found a significant
association of THE1B elements with human placenta–enriched genes (Fig 1D). Taken
together, these data show that genomic presence of THE1B is associated with differential
expression of nearby genes in anthropoid primate placenta.
Enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) or histone H3 lysine 4 mono-
methylation (H3K4me1), histone modifications associated with classical enhancers, was not
detected at the THE1B upstream of CRH in chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-seq) analyses performed on human placental tissue; however, other genomic THE1B
elements were associated with these modifications (S1 Fig).
THE1B-CRH transgenic mice express human CRH in placenta
In order to study the regulation of CRH in placenta, we created a novel mouse model by incor-
porating a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) with the human CRH gene and approxi-
mately 180 kb of flanking sequence, including the THE1B LTR, into the genome of FVB/N
mice (Fig 2A). Random integration of this BAC resulted in two founder animals, denoted Tg
(BAC1) and Tg(BAC2), which were bred independently to C57BL/6 mice and maintained as
separate lines. We then tested for the presence of human CRH in adult tissues and determined
that expression of CRH in Tg(BAC1)/+ and Tg(BAC2)/+ animals is remarkably specific to the
hypothalamus and placenta at embryonic day 18.5 (E18.5) (Fig 2B). No human CRH was
detected in any tissues of nontransgenic littermates.
Placental expression of human CRH delays parturition in transgenic mice
As expression of CRH in human placenta is known to correlate with timing of parturition [1],
we examined the timing of birth in Tg(BAC1) and Tg(BAC2) mouse lines. When compared
with strain-matched control litters, Tg(BAC1)/Tg(BAC1) litters were born an average of 14.9
hours later (one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc, P < 0.0001; Fig 2C), and Tg(BAC2)/Tg
(BAC2) litters were born an average of 9.3 hours later (one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc,
P = 0.0006; Fig 2C), suggesting that placental expression of human CRH is sufficient to alter
gestation length in mice. This effect of CRH appears to be independent of progesterone with-
drawal, as no differences were detected in maternal serum progesterone or in uterine expres-
sion of the contractile-associated proteins oxytocin receptor (Oxtr), connexin-43 (Gja1),
exon 1. This transcript is not found in pre- or postcapture RNA-seq; however, THE1B is transcribed. Raw data can be found at GEO

 caveolin-1 (Cav1), cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1; Ptgs1), or cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2; Ptgs2) at
E18.5 (S2 Fig). A significant decrease in prostaglandin F2α was noted in uterine tissue of Tg
(BAC1)/Tg(BAC1) litters at E18.5 (S2 Fig).
To eliminate the possibility that this alteration of gestation length was a result of hypotha-
lamic human CRH expression, we repeated these experiments with C57BL/6 (nontransgenic)
mothers. Wild-type mice delivering Tg(BAC1)/+ litters completed gestation an average of 11.0
hours later than strain-matched control litters (unpaired two-tailed t-test, P = 0.0003; Fig 2D),
associating the delayed parturition phenotype with the genotype of the fetal-derived placenta.
Deletion of THE1B by CRISPR/Cas9 eliminates placental CRH expression
To determine if retroviral LTR THE1B is necessary for placental CRH expression, we used the
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)
system to specifically delete THE1B from the genome of Tg(BAC1) mice. We utilized two
guide RNAs targeting the 50 end of THE1B and the 30 end immediately flanking the 366-bp
THE1B sequence such that the THE1B element would be deleted by nonhomologous end join-
ing of the surrounding sequence (Fig 2E). Microinjection of guide RNAs and Cas9 mRNA into
the cytoplasm of the zygotes generated by Tg(BAC1)/+ crosses resulted in two founder animals
with deletions greater than 300 bp. Sanger sequencing of the deletions revealed that the larger
deletion, termed Tg(CR1), completely lacked the THE1B element (Fig 2F). The other deletion,
termed Tg(CR2), contained 12 bp at the 50 end of THE1B that were deleted in Tg(CR1). This
12-bp sequence is comprised of 2 bp of THE1B sequence and 10 bp immediately upstream of
the THE1B element (Fig 2F).
Next, we measured the mRNA expression of human CRH in placenta of Tg(CR1)/+ and Tg
(CR2)/+ animals at E18.5. Complete deletion of THE1B in the Tg(CR1) line abolished placen-
tal expression of human CRH (one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc, P = 0.0006 compared
to Tg[BAC1]; Fig 2G). The Tg(CR2) line retains 2 bp of the 50 end of THE1B and subsequently
expressed about 20% human CRH relative to the Tg(BAC1) parent line (one-way ANOVA
with Tukey post hoc, P = 0.0035; Fig 2G).
We next examined the effect of THE1B deletion on the other primary site of CRH expres-
sion, the hypothalamus. As expected, deletion of THE1B did not abolish hypothalamic expres-
sion of human CRH in either transgenic line. Complete deletion of THE1B in the Tg(CR1) line
appeared to increase expression of human CRH in the hypothalamus (one-way ANOVA with
Tukey post hoc, P = 0.0033 compared to Tg[BAC1], P = 0.0013 compared to Tg[CR2]; Fig
2H). We detected compensatory down-regulation of mouse Crh in hypothalamus, resulting in
no difference in serum corticosterone relative to nontransgenic mice (S3 Fig). We also exam-
ined the effect of THE1B deletion on the other protein-coding gene contained on the BAC,
TRIM55, which is a ubiquitin E3-ligase expressed in striated muscle [40, 41]. TRIM55 expres-
sion was detectable by RNA-seq in Tg(BAC1) placenta but not in Tg(CR1) placenta at E18.5,
demonstrating that THE1B elements may control expression of multiple genes in a region (S4
Fig).
Deletion of THE1B by CRISPR/Cas9 restores wild-type gestation length
To further interrogate the role of placental CRH in delayed onset of parturition, we examined
the gestation length of Tg(CR1) and Tg(CR2) animals. The gestation length of litters homozy-
gous for either Tg(CR1) or Tg(CR2) was not significantly different from strain-matched con-
trol litters (one-way ANOVA, P = 0.0568; Fig 2I), demonstrating that complete deletion of
THE1B and subsequent lack of placental CRH rescued the extended-gestation phenotype of
the Tg(BAC1) parent line. Tg(CR2)/Tg(CR2) litters had unusual variability in their gestation

 length, which could be due to the low level of expression of CRH from the residual 50 insertion
site of THE1B (Fig 2G). Despite this variability, Tg(CR2)/+ litters showed no differences in
birth timing relative to control litters (S5 Fig).
TF DLX3 interacts with THE1B 50 insertion site
Transposable elements, especially those arising from retroviral LTRs, can activate gene expres-
sion by recruiting binding of available TFs [18, 22]. To determine the pool of TFs present in
anthropoid primate placenta when CRH is known to be highly expressed, we analyzed placen-
tal transcriptomes generated by RNA-seq from two human and two rhesus macaque placentas
near term. We identified a set of 90 TFs expressed at 10 transcripts per million (TPM) or
greater in all samples, which we defined as moderately expressed TFs, and proceeded to exam-
ine potential binding of these TFs to the THE1B sequence with the prediction tool CisBP [42].
Two families of TFs known to contribute to placental trophoblast differentiation, GATA [43]
and DLX [44], were predicted by CisBP to interact with the 50 end of the THE1B sequence that
was retained in Tg(CR2) but deleted in Tg(CR1). When tested by gel shift assay, DLX3, but
not GATA2, was able to bind the 50 end of THE1B (Fig 3A). This DLX3 binding site is located
at the junction of the THE1B element and the surrounding DNA (Fig 3B).
We then performed ChIP with anti-DLX3 antibody in human term placental tissue and
quantified by real-time PCR to determine the occupancy of this DLX3 binding site in vivo.
DLX3 was significantly associated with the 50 end of THE1B and with a previously described
placental regulatory element [45], when compared to a negative control region (one-way
ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc, P < 0.0001 for THE1B and P = 0.0184 for human glycopro-
tein hormone α-subunit junctional regulatory element [JRE] relative to JRE distal; Fig 3C).
DLX3 binding to THE1B may drive CRH expression in
syncytiotrophoblasts
In human placental tissue, the syncytium is the site of CRH expression and secretion into
maternal and fetal circulations [48, 49]. We demonstrated localization of human CRH to the
labyrinth of the Tg(BAC1)/+ mouse placenta, which contains mouse syncytiotrophoblasts (Fig
3D). We also confirmed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) that expression of human CRH was
absent in the junctional zone (Fig 3E). Despite differences in placental morphology between
human and mouse, DLX3 is produced in both human [50] and mouse [47] syncytiotropho-
blasts. In Tg(BAC1)/+ placenta, 80%–99% of total Dlx3 expression was localized to the laby-
rinth tissue (n = 5 Tg[BAC1]/+, P = 0.0003 by paired two-tailed t-test; Fig 3E).
Discussion
Here, we present a case of anthropoid primate–specific placental gene expression induced by
retroviral LTR insertion into the genome. Our study provides evidence that an LTR element
found in a separate evolutionary lineage is capable of operating as a novel placental enhancer
in another species. Placental tissue is globally hypomethylated and remarkably hospitable to
endogenous retroviral elements [51, 52]. Endogenous retroviral LTRs have been co-opted for
placenta-specific expression of hormones [35], endothelial factors [37, 53], and immune recep-
tors [39]. Several of the THE1B-associated genes in our study that are expressed at significantly
higher levels in human relative to mouse placenta have been previously implicated in human
placental function, including the regulation of birth timing (CGA [54], CRH [1]) and adverse
pregnancy outcomes like preeclampsia (ADAM12, PGF [55], ZFAT [56], TUSC3 [57]) and
recurrent miscarriage (ADM [58]). These findings suggest that THE1B elements likely

 influence the expression of a network of genes in human placenta and that this network of
THE1B-associated genes may contribute to proper placental function.
Despite several lines of evidence implicating THE1B as an enhancer for CRH, we did not
detect classical enhancer chromatin marks (H3K27Ac, H3K4me1) on this element in human
term placental samples. It is possible that the THE1B near CRH enhances transcription using a
different mechanism than the majority of vertebrate enhancers or, alternatively, that the posi-
tive enhancer signal is being diluted by the cells within the placenta that do not express CRH.
Previous studies of the species specificity of placental CRH expression have predominantly
focused on the proximal promoter sequence of CRH [59, 60]. Scatena and Adler reported no
expression of a luciferase reporter construct containing the 5-kb upstream region including
THE1B in rat choriocarcinoma cells; this and other experiments led them to conclude that the
species specificity of placental CRH expression was caused by trans-acting factors [59]. Our
BAC transgenic mouse model incorporates both the human CRH and the mouse Crh promoter
sequences and flanking regions; thus, differences in expression in this model are due to
sequence differences rather than trans-acting factor availability. We observed differences in
CRH expression when the THE1B sequence was intact (Tg[BAC1] and Tg[BAC2]), partially
intact at the 50 end (Tg[CR2]), and absent (Tg[CR1]), suggesting that the 50 end of the THE1B
LTR and its upstream insertion site are disproportionally active in the regulation of CRH in
placenta.
The partially intact region of THE1B in Tg(CR2) mice contains an active binding site for
the TF DLX3. DLX3 is present in mouse placenta and required for trophoblast differentiation;
mice lacking Dlx3 are unable to develop past embryonic day 10 due to placental failure [30].
The coexpression of Dlx3 and CRH in Tg(BAC1) mouse placenta further associates DLX3
availability and THE1B-dependent expression of CRH. Notably, the DLX3 site occurs where
the THE1B element joins the surrounding sequence, suggesting a possible mechanism for acti-
vation of this particular LTR upon retroviral insertion into the anthropoid primate common
ancestral genome.
Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to provide evidence that placental expression of
CRH in a nonprimate model alters gestation length. Surprisingly, human CRH expression in
the placentas of our transgenic mice resulted in postterm rather than preterm birth. Although
uterine prostaglandin F2α was significantly lower in Tg(BAC1) animals, progesterone with-
drawal and expression of contractile-associated proteins were unaffected, indicating that CRH
may alter birth timing without impeding luteolysis. Previous studies have shown that CRH
plays a role in myometrial quiescence, inhibiting myometrial contractility at low CRH concen-
tration [61–63]. This inhibition of uterine contractility is consistent with the postterm birth
effect seen in our mouse model. These data suggest that CRH may be a factor contributing to

 the extended gestational period of anthropoid primates and that increased production of CRH
in pregnancies ending prematurely may be an attempt to block the progression toward pre-
term labor and delivery.
The extraordinary diversity found in eutherian placental gene expression is thought to
result from conflict between mother and fetus in determining optimal conditions for fetal
development and maternal investment [64–66]. Placental tolerance to LTRs may play a role in
this ongoing evolutionary conflict by providing a mechanism for rapid changes in gene expres-
sion. Our study demonstrates that retroviral insertion of an LTR such as THE1B can alter gene
expression at the level of an individual gene and potentially across the entire placental tissue.
Conservation of both THE1B and placental CRH expression in anthropoid primate species
and the correlation of maternal serum CRH concentrations with gestation length support our
assertion that the THE1B-CRH regulatory system is critical for birth timing.
Materials and methods
Human and rhesus tissue collection, RNA-seq, and transcriptome analysis
Human (GEO accession: GSE87726) and rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta; GEO accession:
GSE118284) placental transcriptomes were generated as previously described [67, 68]. Briefly,
two human placentas were collected by cesarean section at 39 weeks 1 day and 39 weeks 2 days
gestational age (IRB protocol: CCHMC IRB 2013–2243). Two macaque placentas were col-
lected by cesarean section at 128 days and 131 days gestational age (80% completed gestation).
RNA was extracted from placental biopsies with the TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After passing initial quality control metrics,
RNA-seq of the four samples was performed on an Illumina HiSeq machine using a paired-
end approach with 50-bp reads, generating approximately 30 million paired reads per sample
(human) and 15 million paired reads per sample (macaque). The reads were aligned and pseu-
docounted using kallisto [69]. To make the two transcriptomes comparable, we used the set of
genes that are orthologous between the two species and recalculated the levels of expression of
single genes in each species based only on this set. The levels are expressed on a TPM scale
[70].
PCR screening for THE1B-CRH fusion transcript in human and rhesus
Human and rhesus placental RNA was converted to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse
Transcriptase Kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. PCR screening was per-
formed with primers specific to THE1B and CRH exon 2 (forward: 50-CCTCCCCTACCAT
GTGAAAA-30, reverse: 50-GGAAGAAATCCAAGGGCT-30) as well as with internal primers
downstream of THE1B and in CRH exon 1 (forward: 50- TGCTGTGCATAGCTTCTCCTC-30,
reverse: 50-TGCCTCTGCTCCTGCATAAA-30). PCR products were examined by agarose gel
electrophoresis and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.
Relative coexpression analysis of THE1B-associated genes
The statistical test for the effect of the presence of THE1B in the vicinity of the gene on the tis-
sue-specific expression is described in detail by Pavlicev and colleagues [33]. Briefly, we com-
pared the correlation between tissues based on the expression (expressed as the square root of
the TPM value) of THE1B-associated genes to the correlation between tissues based on
THE1B-absent genes. We repeated this procedure for all pair-wise tissue combinations. If the
THE1B elements confer no particular status to the genes, this ratio corrTHE1B+/corrTHE1B−
should be close to 1 for every pair-wise tissue comparison. The significance of the effect was

 assessed based on the null distribution of the statistics for each pair of tissues compared, gener-
ated by randomly resampling 5,000 times the set of genes size matched to the number of
THE1B-associated genes and calculating the statistics.
THE1B capture array and analysis
Total RNA was purified from term placentas using a combination of TRIzol and Qiagen col-
umns. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the SureSelect Strand-Specific RNA Library
Prep for Illumina Multiplexed Sequencing kit (Agilent). For capture sequencing, preamplified
RNA-seq libraries were enriched for THE1B containing transcripts using a custom panel of
120 nt THE1B RNA oligos and the SureSelectXT RNA Target Enrichment kit (Agilent). Librar-
ies were sequenced as 75-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina HiSeq machine. Reads were
aligned to the human genome (hg19) using Tophat2 (-I 100000—max-segment-intron 100000
-r 300) [71]. Data are available at GEO accession GSE118289.
Annotation of human placenta–enriched genes
We compiled a collection of RNA-seq data for different human and mouse tissues from differ-
ent resources, including (1) newly generated (GEO accession: GSE118289) and public (GEO
accession: GSE43520) data for human placenta, (2) data for mouse placenta (GEO accession:
GSE43520), and (3) data for different human tissues (brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, ovary,
skeletal muscle, and testis) from BodyMap 2.0 (GEO accession: GSE30611). Reference genome
and gene annotation files for human (GRCh38) and mouse (GRCm38) were downloaded from
the ENSEMBL database. Human placenta–enriched genes were identified by a procedure com-
paring human placenta against other human tissues and against mouse placenta. In brief, we
first quantified gene expression levels for different samples as TPM using RSEM [72]. Then,
we focused the analysis on the 13,068 1-to-1 orthologous genes between human and mouse
according to ENSEMBL orthologue annotation. After the TPM values were normalized
among different samples using the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method [73], differen-
tial expression analyses between human placenta and other analyzed human tissues and
mouse placenta were performed using Rank Product method [74], with an FDR cutoff of 0.15.
Finally, human placenta–enriched genes were annotated as genes that show significantly
higher expression in human placenta against other human tissues and mouse placenta.
Association analysis between human placenta–enriched genes and THE1B
subfamily
We obtained repeat annotations for human THE1B subfamily from the RepeatMasker website
(http://www.repeatmasker.org/) on May 27, 2016. To determine if the THE1B subfamily is
associated with human placenta–enriched genes, we first determined the overlapping between
THE1B repeat elements and promoter (defined as 20 kb upstream the longest transcript for
each gene) for each protein-coding gene using the windowBed function of bedtools [75].
Then, the occurrences of THE1B in all these genes and in human placenta–enriched genes
were counted. Finally, Binomial Test was performed to test if the THE1B subfamily is signifi-
cantly associated with human placenta–enriched genes.

 0051. Animal procedures were designed and executed according to the guidelines of the
National Institutes of Health.
Establishment of transgenic mouse lines
Human BAC RP11-366K18 was obtained from the CHORI BACPAC repository. DNA was
amplified and purified from bacteria using NucleoBond BAC kit (Clontech) and dissolved in
polyamine buffer for microinjection. To generate lines Tg(BAC1) and Tg(BAC2), FVB/N
zygotes were used for pronuclear injection of purified BAC DNA at 0.5 ng/ul and transferred
into pseudopregnant CD-1 mice. The resulting pups were genotyped for presence of the
human BAC with primers specific to human CRH (forward: 50-TTTCTAATGTGAAAACTG
CGTGAT-30, reverse: 50-ACACGTGGGAATTATGGGGG-30). Transgenic lines were main-
tained as hemizygotes by crossing to C57BL/6 mice for 3–4 generations.
To delete the THE1B in the BAC transgenic mice, we selected 6 guide RNAs targeting the
THE1B flanking region (3 per end), based on the web design tool (http://www.genome-
engineering.org). Selected guide RNAs were cloned into pX458 vector (addgene #48138) and
validated in HEK293 cells by T7E1 assay as described by Ran and colleagues [76]. Two vali-
dated guide RNAs (target sites: 50-ATACATTTTGGATAATGATA-30 and 50-AGACAAAT
ACAGATAAATTG-30), along with Cas9 mRNA, were introduced by cytoplasmic injection
into zygotes obtained from Tg(BAC1) mice [77]. Injected embryos were transferred into pseu-
dopregnant CD-1 mice. The resulting pups were screened for deletions to the THE1B region
with primers flanking THE1B (forward: 50-CAGTTTGTGTGCCTCTGCTG-30, reverse: 50-
CTCCCATTGGGCTATCTGGG-30) by PCR and Sanger sequencing.
Mouse tissue collection and RNA isolation
Male mice were housed with females overnight to determine time of conception. Pregnant
female mice were killed on the designated day of gestation, and placentas were harvested, dis-
sected into labyrinth and junctional zone where indicated, and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Tissue from the tail of corresponding embryos was used to determine placental genotype with
primers specific to human CRH, as described earlier. Hypothalamus, kidney, heart, liver, lung,
and leg quadriceps muscle tissue were harvested from adult transgenic animals and littermate
controls of both sexes, and tissues were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Tissues were
homogenized using stainless steel beads in a TissueLyser II apparatus (Qiagen), and RNA was
purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Heart and skeletal muscle RNA was purified
using the RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen). Labyrinth and junctional zone RNA was
purified using the TRIzol reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific) according to manufacturer’s
instructions.
qPCR for human CRH expression in transgenic mice
Mouse tissue RNA was converted to cDNA using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcriptase Kit
(Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Human CRH was quantified using the
TaqMan system with TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific) and
specific probes for human CRH (Hs01921237_s1, ThermoFisher Scientific) and for mouse
Gapdh as endogenous control (Mm99999915_g1, ThermoFisher Scientific). Labyrinth
and junctional zone expression was quantified with specific probes for human CRH
(Hs00174941_m1, ThermoFisher Scientific), mouse Dlx3 (Mm00438428_m1, ThermoFisher
Scientific), and eukaryotic 18S as endogenous control (catalog 4310893E, ThermoFisher Scien-
tific). A 50-ng cDNA template was used per well, and samples were run in triplicate. qPCR
reactions were run on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR instrument.

 Localization of human CRH by immunohistochemistry/
immunofluorescence
Placentas of E18.5 pups were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4 ˚C, washed
in PBS, and dehydrated in 70% ethanol before embedding in paraffin. Paraffin sections were
cut using a microtome. Sections were deparaffinized, incubated in citrate buffer pH 6.0 for
antigen retrieval, and incubated in methanol with hydrogen peroxide for peroxidase activity
removal. Following washes, slides were incubated with 5% goat serum and 4% fish skin gelatin
for 60 minutes. Slides were incubated with CRH primary antibody (rabbit, Peninsula Lab T-
4036, 1:1,000) overnight at 4 ˚C. Following washes, slides were incubated with secondary anti-
body (biotinylated goat anti-rabbit, Vector Lab BA-1000, 1:250) for 60 minutes. Tyramide
amplification was performed with TSA cyanine 5 reagent kit (Perkin Elmer) according to
manufacturer protocol.
Quantification of gestation length in transgenic mice
Experimental animals and their respective control animals were generated by crossing hemizy-
gous transgenic mice and subsequently crossing their homozygous offspring such that all
study animals were the offspring of littermates. Male mice were housed with nulliparous
female mice from approximately 1900 to 2200 hours once per week to precisely control time of
conception. Pregnant females were monitored by observation from E17.5 until delivery. Pups
were counted and weighed individually on the day of birth. Females were excluded from the
study if there were fewer than four pups in the litter, if the female was older than 240 days of
age on the date of conception, if the female was in labor for longer than 12 hours, or if the
entire litter could not be delivered because of dystocia.
Binding site prediction of placental TFs
Human and rhesus macaque placental transcriptome data were analyzed as previously stated.
TFs expressed at 10 or greater TPM were populated into the predictive program CisBP [42].
Binding sites were predicted using the position-weight matrix (PWM)–LogOdds setting
(threshold 8).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay for binding at THE1B
Immortalized extravillous trophoblast cell line HTR8/SVneo (obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection, item number CRL-3271) was transfected with Lipofectamine3000
(ThermoFisher Scientific) and overexpression vector (DLX3 or GATA2 Myc-DDK vectors,
Origene) for 72 hours according to manufacturer protocol. Cytoplasmic protein fraction was
isolated by suspending cell pellet in cytoplasmic lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.1
mM EDTA in dH2O) and adding 10% Nonidet-P40. Nuclear protein fraction was subse-
quently isolated by suspending nuclear pellet in nuclear lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES, 0.4 M
KCl, 1 mM EDTA in dH2O). DNA probes were generated with IRDye700 at the 50 end
(GATA2 TCR probe: 50-CACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATAACTCT-30 [78], DLX3 JRE
probe: 50-GGGGGGTAATTACAGGCCC-30 [79], THE1B 50 probe: 50-GGATAATGA-
TATGGTTAGA-30). Binding reactions were performed using the Odyssey EMSA Buffer Kit
(LICOR Biosciences) according to manufacturer protocol with primary antibody (monoclonal
anti-FLAG M2, Sigma-Aldrich F3165) or isotype control (mouse IgG, Abcam ab37355) and
run on 6% TBE gels with 0.5× TBE buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Gels were imaged on the
Odyssey CLx Imaging System (LICOR Biosciences).

 ChIP and qPCR
Human placental tissue was homogenized in aliquots of 100 mg tissue per mL PBS with prote-
ase inhibitor (Abcam ab65621). Homogenate was transferred to a new tube with 18-gauge nee-
dle and syringe to ensure single cell suspension. Crosslinking was performed by adding 1.5%
formaldehyde to suspension and incubating at room temperature for 10 minutes. Glycine was
added to a final concentration of 125 mM to stop crosslinking reaction. Cells were washed
twice with PBS and resuspended in SDS Lysis Buffer (Millipore). Cell lysate was sonicated to
an average of 500-bp fragments with a Covaris S220 instrument at 175 peak power for 7 min-
utes. Immunoprecipitation was performed with the EZ-ChIP kit (Millipore) according to
manufacturer protocol. Mouse anti-RNA pol II (Millipore 05-623B) and Control Mouse IgG
antibodies (Millipore 12-371B) were used as a positive and negative control according to
EZ-ChIP protocol. For DLX3 ChIP, rabbit anti-DLX3 (Abcam ab66390) and rabbit IgG iso-
type control (Abcam ab171870) were used at 5 μg per immunoprecipitation. qPCR reactions
were run on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR instrument with primers
specific to GAPDH (forward: 50-TACTAGCGGTTTTACGGGCG-30, reverse: 50- TCGAA
CAGGAGGAGCAGAGAGCGA-30), JRE (forward: 50- TGACCTAAGGGTTGAAACAAG
