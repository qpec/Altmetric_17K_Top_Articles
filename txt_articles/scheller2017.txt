BACKGROUND
The quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is recommended for all 
girls and women 9 to 26 years of age. Some women will have inadvertent exposure 
to vaccination during early pregnancy, but few data exist regarding the safety of 
the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in this context.
METHODS
We assessed a cohort that included all the women in Denmark who had a preg-
nancy ending between October 1, 2006, and November 30, 2013. Using nationwide 
registers, we linked information on vaccination, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and 
potential confounders among women in the cohort. Women who had vaccine ex-
posure during the prespecified time windows were matched for propensity score 
in a 1:4 ratio with women who did not have vaccine exposure during the same time 
windows. Outcomes included spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, major birth defect, 
small size for gestational age, low birth weight, and preterm birth.
RESULTS
In matched analyses, exposure to the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was not associated 
with significantly higher risks than no exposure for major birth defect (65 cases 
among 1665 exposed pregnancies and 220 cases among 6660 unexposed pregnan-
cies; prevalence odds ratio, 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.58), spon-
taneous abortion (20 cases among 463 exposed pregnancies and 131 cases among 
1852 unexposed pregnancies; hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.14), preterm 
birth (116 cases among 1774 exposed pregnancies and 407 cases among 7096 
unexposed pregnancies; prevalence odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.42), low 
birth weight (76 cases among 1768 exposed pregnancies and 277 cases among 
7072 unexposed pregnancies; prevalence odds ratio, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.43), 
small size for gestational age (171 cases among 1768 exposed pregnancies and 783 
cases among 7072 unexposed pregnancies; prevalence odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 
0.72 to 1.02), or stillbirth (2 cases among 501 exposed pregnancies and 4 cases 
among 2004 unexposed pregnancies; hazard ratio, 2.43; 95% CI, 0.45 to 13.21).
CONCLUSIONS
Quadrivalent HPV vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with a signifi-
cantly higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes than no such exposure. (Funded

H
uman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines 
are recommended for all girls and women 
9 to 26 years of age,1,2 and more than 
72 million girls and women have been vaccinat-
ed worldwide.3 Although HPV vaccination is not 
recommended in pregnancy, a number of women 
will be inadvertently vaccinated early in the first 
trimester of unplanned or unrecognized preg-
nancies.4,5 However, data on the safety of vacci-
nation during pregnancy are limited.6
The clinical trials of HPV vaccines did not 
include women who were known to be pregnant. 
Consequently, analyses of safety during preg-
nancy that were based on data from clinical 
trials focused mainly on the risk of adverse 
pregnancy outcomes associated with HPV vac-
cines that were administered before pregnancy 
onset.7-9 These studies did not identify a signifi-
cant difference in the risk of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes, although one pooled analysis of two 
trials of the bivalent HPV vaccine showed a non-
significantly higher risk of spontaneous abortion 
among women whose pregnancies were con-
ceived less than 90 days from bivalent HPV vac-
cination than among those in the control group 
(13.7% vs. 9.2%, one-sided P 
= 
0.03).7 However, 
this finding could not be substantiated in an up-
dated, larger study that included a meta-analysis 
of the risk of spontaneous abortion among 
women whose pregnancies were conceived less 
than 90 days from bivalent HPV vaccination, as 
compared with women in the control group 
(relative risk, 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], 
0.82 to 1.51).9
Observational studies have been few and limit-
ed by size and design and are therefore inade-
quate to evaluate the risks associated with HPV 
vaccination during pregnancy. A cohort study of 
the bivalent HPV vaccine, which included only 
207 vaccinated women, showed that the risk of 
adverse pregnancy outcomes was not higher 
among women whose first day of gestation oc-
curred between 30 days before vaccination and 
45 days after vaccination than among women 
whose first day of gestation was between 120 days 
and 18 months after the last dose of bivalent 
HPV vaccine.10 Two studies that were based on 
data from the same manufacturer-managed preg-
nancy register of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine 
also showed that the risk among vaccinated 
women was not greater than the expected risk in 
the general population, but these studies were 
based on voluntary reporting and lacked control 
groups.11,12
To investigate the safety of HPV vaccine further, 
we conducted a nationwide register-based cohort 
study involving all pregnant women in Den-
mark. We investigated the association between 
quadrivalent HPV vaccination during pregnancy 
and the risks of a major birth defect, spontane-
ous abortion, stillbirth, preterm birth, low birth 
weight, and small size for gestational age.
Methods
Cohort
Using the Medical Birth Register13 and the Na-
tional Patient Register,14 we identified all preg-
nancies in Denmark that ended in a singleton 
birth or an abortive outcome between October 1, 
2006, and November 30, 2013 (Fig. 1). We then 
estimated the date of pregnancy onset by sub-
tracting the gestational age from the date of 
birth or abortion. Records of gestational age for 
live-born infants and stillbirths are based main-
ly on ultrasonography, whereas records of gesta-
tional age in abortive outcomes are based on 
ultrasonography or the first day of the last men-
strual period.15 The records of gestational age 
for live births were validated to be accurate 
within 1 week for 87% of the records.16
We subsequently excluded pregnancies with 
missing or implausible data on gestational age, 
pregnancies with multiple overlapping records, 
and pregnancies in women who had not lived 
continuously in Denmark for the 2-year period 
before pregnancy onset. In addition, for analyses 
of spontaneous abortion, we excluded all cases of

Exposure, Yielding Five Outcome-Specific Cohorts.
Values regarding exclusions do not sum to the total 
number because some pregnancies were excluded for 
more than one reason. Between the unmatched and 
matched analyses, all the excluded records were from 
unmatched pregnancies that did not have vaccine ex-
posure. All the outcome-specific analyses were matched 
for maternal age, calendar year of pregnancy onset, 
and propensity score, and the analyses of spontaneous 
abortion and stillbirth were also matched for gesta-
tional age.

spontaneous abortion that occurred within the 
first 6 weeks of gestation, because many cases 
of spontaneous abortion during the first weeks of 
gestation are likely to be clinically unrecognized. 
Consequently, for analyses of spontaneous abor-
tion we also excluded women who had been ex-
posed to vaccination within the first 6 weeks of 
gestation to ensure that immortal time (a follow-
up period during which the study outcome, by 
design, could not occur) was not introduced.
We then defined two cohorts: one cohort in-
cluded all the pregnancies that ended in live birth 
and was used for the analyses of major birth de-
fect, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small 
size for gestational age; and the second cohort 
included all the pregnancies and was used for 
the analyses of spontaneous abortion and still-
birth (Fig. 1). The unique personal identification 
numbers that are given to every resident in Den-
mark enabled the individual-level linkage of our 
cohort with nationwide health and demographic 
registers containing information on vaccination, 
adverse outcomes, and potential confounders (see 
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org).17
The study was approved by the Danish Data 
Protection Agency. Informed consent is not re-
quired for registry-based research in Denmark. 
The funders and vaccine manufacturers had no 
role in the design and conduct of the study; the 
collection, management, analysis, and interpreta-
tion of the data; the preparation, review, or ap-
proval of the manuscript; or the decision to submit 
the manuscript for publication. The first and last 
authors take responsibility for the accuracy and 
completeness of the reported data and analyses.
Vaccination
During the study period, the quadrivalent HPV 
vaccine (Gardasil, Sanofi Pasteur MSD [manufac-
tured in the United States by Merck]) was the sole 
HPV vaccine used in the Danish national vaccina-
tion program (see the Supplementary Appendix). 
The few women who were vaccinated with the 
bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix, GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals) before or during pregnancy were 
excluded from our study (Fig. 1).
Information on quadrivalent HPV vaccinations 
that were given through the national vaccination 
program was obtained from the Danish Child-
hood Vaccination Database.18 The quadrivalent 
HPV vaccine was also available by prescription, 
so additional data on vaccination status were ob-
tained from the Danish National Prescription 
Registry.19 We defined the date of exposure to 
the quadrivalent HPV vaccine as the date of the 
first vaccination or filled prescription. Exposure 
windows were categorized according to study out-
come: the first trimester (pregnancy onset through 
week 12 of gestation) for the analysis of major 
birth defect, the start of week 7 through week 22 
of gestation for the analysis of spontaneous abor-
tion, the start of week 7 of gestation until birth 
for the analysis of stillbirth, before 37 completed 
weeks of gestation for the analysis of preterm 
birth, and at any time during pregnancy for the 
analyses of low birth weight and small size for 
gestational age. In each analysis, unexposed preg-
nancies were defined as pregnancies in women 
who were not vaccinated during the specified 
exposure window.
Outcomes
The outcome of major birth defects overall was 
defined as the first registered diagnosis of any 
major birth defect within the first year of life 
(see the Supplementary Appendix), as identified 
in the National Patient Register.14 A validation 
study of the National Patient Register estimated 
a predictive value of 88% for diagnoses of birth 
defects overall.20 Cases of spontaneous abortion 
(defined as fetal death occurring through 22 weeks 
of gestation) were identified in the National Pa-
tient Register. Validation has shown that the 
records were correct for 99% of the diagnoses of 
spontaneous abortion (details on abortive out-
comes are provided in the Supplementary Appen-
dix).21 Information on stillbirth (defined as fetal 
loss after 22 completed weeks of gestation), pre-
term birth (delivery before 37 completed weeks 
of gestation), low birth weight (<2500 g), and 
small size for gestational age (birth weight in 
the lowest 10th percentile of gestational age–
specific birth weight in the cohort) was obtained 
from the Medical Birth Register. For the analyses 
of low birth weight and small size for gesta-
tional age, we excluded records of all the preg-
nancies resulting in live birth for which informa-
tion on birth weight was missing.
Statistical Analysis
Because different exposure windows and exclusion 
criteria were applied to the analysis set of each 
distinct outcome, we created five unmatched

Quadrivalent HPV Vaccination and Pregnancy Outcomes
outcome-specific cohorts (Fig. 1). Selected base-
line characteristics were then identified for each 
woman at pregnancy onset, and missing values 
were imputed with the use of mode imputation 
(Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). To 
account for potential confounders, we calculated 
propensity scores using logistic regression, which 
estimated the probability of quadrivalent HPV 
vaccination in outcome-specific exposure time 
windows, given all baseline characteristics (and 
all two-way interactions between demographic 
variables).
For each of the five outcome-specific cohorts, 
we then matched vaccinated women and unvac-
cinated women in a 1:4 ratio according to age 
(5-year categories), calendar year of pregnancy 
onset, and propensity score, thus creating a dis-
tinct matched analysis set for each of the five 
outcome-specific cohorts (Fig. 1). We added ges-
tational age as a matching criterion for the co-
horts regarding spontaneous abortion and still-
birth, the risks of which are highly dependent on 
gestational age.
Matching was performed with the use of the 
nearest-neighbor matching algorithm (caliper 
width, 0.2 of the standard deviation of the logit 
score). We assessed the balance of covariates 
that was achieved from matching by evaluating 
standardized differences between vaccinated 
groups and unvaccinated groups. We considered 
covariates with a standardized difference of less 
than 10% to be well balanced.
We performed the analyses of spontaneous 
abortion and stillbirth using gestational age as 
the underlying time scale. Hazard ratios with 
95% confidence intervals were estimated with 
the use of Cox proportional-hazards regression. 
The Wald test was used to assess the fulfillment 
of the proportional-hazards assumption, which 
was fulfilled for the analyses of stillbirth (P 
= 
0.83) 
and spontaneous abortion (P 
= 
0.46). In the analy-
ses of major birth defect, preterm birth, low 
birth weight, and small size for gestational age, 
we used logistic regression to estimate prevalence 
odds ratios. The generalized estimating equation 
method was used for all analyses to account for 
the possible correlation between pregnancies 
within the same mother.
We performed a number of prespecified sen-
sitivity analyses. In the analysis of major birth 
defect, we restricted the exposure window to 
weeks 4 to 10 of gestation, which corresponds to 
the period of maximal susceptibility to terato-
genic agents.22 Basing the analysis of major birth 
defect only on live births could potentially intro-
duce misclassification by the exclusion of still-
births and induced abortions that were caused 
by major birth defects, thus potentially biasing 
results toward no association. We therefore con-
ducted an analysis of major birth defect that 
included stillbirths and induced abortions (see 
the Supplementary Appendix). Furthermore, we 
performed a complete-case analysis for each sub-
cohort, which excluded all the participants who 
had missing data. To investigate the potential 
for residual confounding we performed two ad-
ditional analyses: one analysis incorporated 1:1 
matching, because 1:1 matching increases the 
comparability between exposure groups,23 and a 
second analysis incorporated an increase in the 
granularity of the age variable that was used for 
matching, because vaccination and pregnancy 
outcomes are both heavily dependent on age.
Post hoc, we added two sensitivity analyses. 
First, we excluded pregnancies among women 
who were not exposed to vaccination during preg-
nancy but who had been vaccinated within 30 days 
before pregnancy onset. Second, since the date 
of filling a prescription may differ from the ac-
tual date of vaccination, we excluded women who 
were defined as having vaccine exposure when 
they filled a vaccine prescription during preg-
nancy as well as excluding their corresponding 
matches. SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute), 
was used for all the analyses.
Results
Cohorts
During the study period, we identified 649,389 
records of pregnancies, of which 581,550 were 
eligible for inclusion in the study cohort (Fig. 1). 
Taking into account the use of the outcome-
specific exposure windows and exclusion criteria, 
we created five unmatched subcohorts: for the 
analysis of spontaneous abortion, the subcohort 
included 538,169 pregnancies (463 women vacci-
nated during weeks 7 to 22 of gestation); for the 
analysis of major birth defect, the subcohort in-
cluded 396,039 pregnancies (1665 women vacci-
nated in week 0 to week 12 of gestation); for the 
analysis of stillbirth, the subcohort included 
538,169 pregnancies (501 women vaccinated in 
week 7 to birth); for the analysis of preterm

birth, the subcohort included 397,213 pregnan-
cies (1774 women vaccinated in week 0 to week 
37 of gestation); and for the analyses of low 
birth weight and small size for gestational age, 
the subcohorts included 395,139 pregnancies 
(1768 women vaccinated at any time during 
pregnancy).
Before matching was performed, we found 
that vaccinated women were younger, were more 
often nulliparous, had lower levels of education, 
were more likely to be in the two lowest quin-
tiles of household income, were more likely to 
be unmarried, and were more likely to be smok-
ers than were unvaccinated women (Table S3A 
and S3B in the Supplementary Appendix). The 
C-statistic for the propensity-score models ranged 
from 0.79 to 0.82, which indicated that substan-
tial differences existed between the vaccinated 
group and the unvaccinated group. This finding 
highlighted the need to adjust for confounders.
After matching in a 1:4 ratio, we found that 
the included covariates were well balanced be-
tween the vaccinated group and the unvaccinated 
group in almost all outcome-specific subcohorts 
(Tables 1 and 2, and Table S5 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). Parity and number of hospital 
admissions during the previous year were not 
well balanced in the matched analysis of spon-
taneous abortion and stillbirth. Consequently, we 
conducted a sensitivity analysis with additional 
adjustment for these variables.
Outcomes
In unadjusted analyses before propensity-score 
matching, quadrivalent HPV vaccination during 
pregnancy was associated with significantly high-
er risks than no such exposure in the analyses of 
low birth weight (prevalence odds ratio, 1.26; 
95% CI, 1.00 to 1.59), preterm birth (prevalence 
odds ratio, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.67), and major 
birth defect (prevalence odds ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 
1.06 to 1.75). However, quadrivalent HPV vac-
cination was not associated with a significantly 
higher risk of spontaneous abortion (hazard ra-
tio vs. no vaccine exposure, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.60 to 
1.44), small size for gestational age (prevalence 
odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.14), or still-
birth (hazard ratio, 1.90; 95% CI, 0.48 to 7.61).
Table 3 shows analyses in the matched sub-
cohorts. Quadrivalent HPV vaccination during 
pregnancy was not associated with a significantly 
higher risk than no such exposure in the analy-
ses of major birth defect (prevalence odds ratio, 
1.19; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.58), spontaneous abor-
tion (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.14), 
preterm birth (prevalence odds ratio, 1.15; 95% 
CI, 0.93 to 1.42), small size for gestational age 
(prevalence odds ratio, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.72 to 
1.02), or low birth weight (prevalence odds ratio, 
1.10; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.43). The matched analysis 
of stillbirth also showed that the risk with vac-
cine exposure was not significantly higher than 
the risk without vaccine exposure (hazard ratio, 
2.43; 95% CI, 0.45 to 13.21). However, the analy-
sis included only two cases among pregnancies 
with vaccine exposure and four among pregnan-
cies without vaccine exposure.
Sensitivity Analyses
The results of the sensitivity analyses are pre-
sented in Table 4. In an analysis in which the ex-
posure window was limited to weeks 4 to 10 of 
gestation, quadrivalent HPV vaccination was not 
associated with a significantly higher risk than 
no vaccine exposure in the analysis of major 
birth defect. Moreover, the inclusion of informa-
tion on birth defects in pregnancies that ended in 
induced abortion or stillbirth did not materially 
change the results of analyses regarding major 
birth defect. Results for all the outcomes did not 
differ materially from the main analyses when 
the analyses were limited to women who had no 
missing values for any covariates, when 1:1 match-
ing was used, or when we increased the granular-
ity of the age categorization. Post hoc sensitivity 
analyses that excluded unexposed pregnancies 
in women who were vaccinated within 30 days 
before pregnancy onset, that excluded pregnan-
cies that were defined as exposed owing to fill-
ing of a vaccine prescription, or that included 
variables that were not well balanced between 
groups also yielded results similar to those in 
the main analysis (Table S6 in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix).
Discussion
In a nationwide cohort study conducted in Den-
mark, we found that quadrivalent HPV vaccina-
tion during pregnancy was not associated with 
significantly greater risks of adverse pregnancy 
outcomes. Given the upper limits of the confi-
dence intervals in our study, relatively higher 
risks of more than 58% for major birth defect,

Quadrivalent HPV Vaccination and Pregnancy Outcomes
14% for spontaneous abortion, 42% for preterm 
birth, 43% for low birth weight, and 2% for small 
size for gestational age are unlikely to be associ-
ated with quadrivalent HPV vaccination. Our 
analysis of stillbirth included only two cases 
among pregnancies with vaccine exposure, which 
makes it impossible to draw clinically meaning-
ful conclusions regarding this outcome on the 
basis of our data.
Our results are consistent with other evidence 
that does not indicate that the vaccination of 
pregnant women with inactivated virus, bacterial,

Quadrivalent HPV Vaccination and Pregnancy Outcomes
or toxoid vaccines generally confers a higher risk 
of adverse pregnancy outcomes than no such 
vaccination.24 Our results also confirm and con-
siderably expand on results from previous stud-
ies of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. A pooled 
analysis of five phase 3 clinical trials of quadri-
valent HPV vaccine, including 1796 women who 
had been randomly assigned to receive quadriva-
lent HPV vaccine and 1824 women who had been 
randomly assigned to receive placebo, none of 
whom were known to be pregnant at the time of 
vaccination, did not show significant between-
group differences in the rates of spontaneous 
abortion, stillbirth, or birth defects. Because the 
majority of women who subsequently became 
pregnant had been vaccinated at least 6 months 
before the date of conception,8 the study was 
unable to evaluate the risks of quadrivalent HPV 
vaccination during pregnancy directly.8 After 
the licensure of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, a 
manufacturer-managed pregnancy register was 
created, but it relied on voluntary reporting. The 
final study of this pregnancy register included 
1752 reports, with follow-up rates of spontane-
ous abortion and birth defects that were not 
greater than the expected rates in the general 
population.12 However, analysis of data that were 
based on voluntary reporting can identify only 
potential risk signals and can neither estimate the 
risks relative to those in an unexposed popula-
tion nor rule out risks with certainty.
Our study specifically investigated risks that 
are associated with vaccination during preg-
nancy in a large population-based cohort. The 
use of data from nationwide registers allowed 
comparison with a control group of women who 
did not receive vaccination in pregnancy, and the 
data provided detailed individual-level informa-
tion on the characteristics of the participants. 
Furthermore, information on exposure and out-
comes were collected in a prospective and inde-
pendent manner that limited susceptibility to 
recall and selection bias.
The limitations of our study include the need 
to rely on the physician-assigned diagnoses re-
corded in the registry. Misclassification of these 
outcomes could bias results toward no associa-
tion with quadrivalent HPV vaccination. How-
ever, previous validation studies have indicated a 
high degree of accuracy of reported diagnoses of 
spontaneous abortion and birth defects.20,21 The

For the analyses of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth, the reported measures of association are hazard ratios. For the analyses of major 
birth defect, preterm birth, low birth weight, and small size for gestational age, the reported measures of association are prevalence odds 
ratios. Differences in baseline characteristics between women who were vaccinated during pregnancy and those who were not were taken 
into account by means of matching in a 1:4 ratio, according to propensity-matched scores of selected variables, maternal age, and calendar 
year of pregnancy onset. Gestational age was included as a matching criterion in the analyses of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth.

Quadrivalent HPV Vaccination and Pregnancy Outcomes
size for gestational age, stillbirth, and preterm 
birth has not been validated, although the previ-
ous validation of gestational-age reports in this 
cohort suggests that preterm birth is also likely 
to have been reported accurately.16,25 Our analy-
ses of birth defects included only live births. 
However, sensitivity analyses that included data 
on birth defects in aborted fetuses and stillborn 
infants showed similar results. We adjusted the 
analyses for a large number of relevant con-
founders, but we cannot rule out the possibility 
of residual confounding. To examine the poten-
tial for residual confounding, we performed post 
hoc sensitivity analyses to evaluate the effect of 
increased precision in matching and age adjust-
ment; the results were materially unchanged. 
Finally, because many pregnancy outcomes are 
rare, our study did not have the statistical power 
to assess the risks of stillbirth and specific major 
birth defects associated with quadrivalent HPV 
vaccination. Larger studies would be needed to 
address these outcomes.
In conclusion, in this large nationwide study 
we found that the risks of spontaneous abortion, 
major birth defect, stillbirth, preterm birth, small 
size for gestational age, and low birth weight 
were not significantly higher with quadrivalent 
HPV vaccination during pregnancy than without 
vaccination.
