IMPORTANCE Alternate-day fasting has become increasingly popular, yet, to date, no
long-term randomized clinical trials have evaluated its efficacy.
OBJECTIVE To compare the effects of alternate-day fasting vs daily calorie restriction on
weight loss, weight maintenance, and risk indicators for cardiovascular disease.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A single-center randomized clinical trial of obese adults
(18 to 64 years of age; mean body mass index, 34) was conducted between October 1, 2011,
and January 15, 2015, at an academic institution in Chicago, Illinois.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to 1 of 3 groups for 1 year: alternate-day
fasting (25% of energy needs on fast days; 125% of energy needs on alternating “feast days”),
calorie restriction (75% of energy needs every day), or a no-intervention control. The trial
involved a 6-month weight-loss phase followed by a 6-month weight-maintenance phase.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was change in body weight.
Secondary outcomes were adherence to the dietary intervention and risk indicators for
cardiovascular disease.
RESULTS Among the 100 participants (86 women and 14 men; mean [SD] age, 44 [11] years),
the dropout rate was highest in the alternate-day fasting group (13 of 34 [38%]), vs the daily
calorie restriction group (10 of 35 [29%]) and control group (8 of 31 [26%]). Mean weight loss
was similar for participants in the alternate-day fasting group and those in the daily calorie
restriction group at month 6 (–6.8% [95% CI, –9.1% to –4.5%] vs –6.8% [95% CI, –9.1% to
–4.6%]) and month 12 (–6.0% [95% CI, –8.5% to –3.6%] vs –5.3% [95% CI, –7.6% to –3.0%])
relative to those in the control group. Participants in the alternate-day fasting group ate more
than prescribed on fast days, and less than prescribed on feast days, while those in the daily
calorie restriction group generally met their prescribed energy goals. There were no
significant differences between the intervention groups in blood pressure, heart rate,
triglycerides, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, C-reactive protein, or
homocysteine concentrations at month 6 or 12. Mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
levels at month 6 significantly increased among the participants in the alternate-day fasting
group (6.2 mg/dL [95% CI, 0.1-12.4 mg/dL]), but not at month 12 (1.0 mg/dL [95% CI, –5.9 to
7.8 mg/dL]), relative to those in the daily calorie restriction group. Mean low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated by month 12 among the participants
in the alternate-day fasting group (11.5 mg/dL [95% CI, 1.9-21.1 mg/dL]) compared with those
in the daily calorie restriction group.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Alternate-day fasting did not produce superior adherence,
weight loss, weight maintenance, or cardioprotection vs daily calorie restriction.

 T
he first-line therapy prescribed to obese patients for
weight loss is daily calorie restriction.1 However, many
patients find it difficult to adhere to a conventional
weight-loss diet because food intake must be limited every
day.2 As such, adherence to daily calorie restriction de-
creases after 1 month and continues to decline thereafter.3-5
In light of this limitation, another approach that requires
individuals to restrict calories only every other day was
developed.6 This strategy is called alternate-day fasting and
involves a fast day where individuals consume 25% of their
usual intake (approximately 500 kcal), alternated with a “feast
day” where individuals are permitted to consume food ad li-
bitum. Findings from short-term studies indicate that partici-
pants lose 3% to 7% of body weight after 2 to 3 months of al-
ternate-day fasting and experience improvements in lipid
profiles, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity.7-13
Alternate-day fasting regimens have increased in popu-
larity during the past decade, and several best-selling diet
books14,15 have promoted this approach. More than 1 million
copies of these books have been sold in the United States and
United Kingdom to date. Despite the growing popularity of al-
ternate-day fasting, to our knowledge, no long-term random-
ized clinical trials have evaluated its efficacy or compared this
regimen with a conventional weight-loss diet.
We conducted a 1-year, randomized clinical trial to com-
pare the effects of alternate-day fasting vs daily calorie restric-
tion on body weight and risk indicators for cardiovascular
disease.Wehypothesizedthattheparticipantsinthealternate-
dayfastinggroupwouldbemoreadherenttotheirdiet,achieve
greaterweightloss,andexperiencemorepronouncedimprove-
ments in risk indicators for cardiovascular disease during the
6-month weight-loss phase compared with those in the daily
calorie restriction group. We also hypothesized that the alter-
nate-day fasting group would better maintain their weight loss
and sustain their improvements in risk indicators for cardio-
vasculardiseaseduringthe6-monthweight-maintenancephase
compared with the daily calorie restriction group.
Methods
Participants
We conducted the trial between October 1, 2011, and January
15, 2015, at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Participants
were recruited from the Chicago area by means of flyers placed
around the university and were screened via a questionnaire,
an assessment of body mass index, and a pregnancy test. In-
dividuals included were men and women between 18 and 65
years of age, with a body mass index between 25.0 and 39.9
(calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared) who had previously been sedentary (<60 min-
utes per week of light activity for the 3 months prior to the
study). Exclusion criteria were a history of cardiovascular dis-
easeortype1or2diabetes,useofmedicationsthatcouldaffect
study outcomes, unstable weight for 3 months prior to the be-
ginning of the study (>4-kg weight loss or gain), perimeno-
pause or otherwise irregular menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and
currently smoking. The protocol was approved by the Office
for the Protection of Research Subjects at the University of
Illinois at Chicago, and written informed consent was ob-
tained from all participants. The full protocol is available in
Supplement 1.
Randomization and Intervention Groups
Participants were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to an alternate-
day fasting group, daily calorie restriction group, or no-
intervention control group. Randomization was performed by
astratifiedrandomsamplingprocedurebysex,age(18-42years
and 43-65 years), and body mass index (25.0-32.5 and 32.6-
39.9). Block size ranged from 1 to 11 participants. The active
trial duration was 1 year and consisted of a baseline phase (1
month), a weight-loss phase (6 months), and a weight-
maintenance phase (6 months) (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2).
We chose this design because weight loss typically peaks at 6
months during a lifestyle intervention.16 During the baseline
phase, all participants ate their usual diet and maintained a
stable weight. Baseline total energy expenditure was mea-
sured using doubly labeled water.17 All participants were in-
structed not to change their physical activity habits through-
out the trial (eg, not to join a gym) to avoid potential
confounding.
Weight-Loss Phase
Participants in the alternate-day fasting group and those in the
dailycalorierestrictiongroupwereprovidedwithallmealsdur-
ing the first 3 months of the trial and received dietary coun-
seling thereafter (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). During the
6-month weight-loss phase, the intervention groups were in-
structed to reduce their energy intake by a mean of 25% per
day. To achieve this reduction, the alternate-day fasting group
was instructed to consume 25% of baseline energy intake as a
lunch (between 12 PM and 2 PM) on fast days and 125% of base-
line energy intake split between 3 meals on alternating feast
days. The daily calorie restriction group was instructed to con-
sume 75% of baseline energy intake split between 3 meals ev-
ery day. The provided meals were in accordance with the
American Heart Association guidelines18 for macronutrient in-
take, with 30% of energy as fat, 55% as carbohydrate, and 15%
as protein. From months 4 to 6, when food was no longer pro-
vided, intervention participants met individually with a di-
etician or nutritionist weekly to learn how to continue with
their diets on their own.
Key Points
Question Is alternate-day fasting more effective for weight loss
and weight maintenance compared with daily calorie restriction?
Findings This randomized clinical trial included 100 metabolically
healthy obese adults. Weight loss after 1 year in the alternate-day
fasting group (6.0%) was not significantly different from that of
the daily calorie restriction group (5.3%), relative to the
no-intervention control group.
Meaning Alternate-day fasting does not produce superior weight
loss or weight maintenance compared with daily calorie
restriction.

 Weight-Maintenance Phase
Atthebeginningofthe6-monthweight-maintenancephase,total
daily energy expenditure was reassessed using doubly labeled
water.17 Participants were instructed to maintain their body
weight during this phase. Participants in the alternate-day fast-
ing group were instructed to consume 50% of energy needs as
a lunch on fast days and 150% of energy needs split between 3
meals on alternating feast days. Participants in the daily calorie
restriction group were instructed to consume 100% of energy
needssplitbetween3mealseveryday.Interventionparticipants
met with the dietician individually each month to learn cogni-
tivebehavioralstrategiestopreventweightregain19andreceived
personalizedenergytargetsforweightmaintenancebasedonre-
sults from doubly labeled water.
Control Group Protocol
Participants in the control group were instructed to maintain
their weight throughout the trial and not to change their eat-
ing or physical activity habits. Controls received no food or di-
etary counseling but visited the research center at the same
frequency as the intervention participants (to provide out-
come measurements). Controls who completed the 12-
month trial received 3 months of free weight-loss counseling
and a 12-month gym membership at the end of the study.
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome of the study was change in body weight,
which was measured monthly via a digital scale while the par-
ticipant was in a hospital gown. Fat mass and lean mass were
measured every 6 months in the fasted state by dual-energy
x-ray absorptiometry (QDR 4500W; Hologic). Visceral fat mass
was measured every 6 months by magnetic resonance imaging
performed with a 1.5-T magnet (Siemens Vision), and images
were analyzed using validated software.20
Mean percentage energy restriction during the weight-
loss phase was retrospectively calculated by the intake bal-
ance method using doubly labeled water and changes in body
composition.21 Physical activity was measured for 7 consecu-
tive days every 6 months using an activity monitor (SenseWear
Armband Mini; BodyMedia Inc).22 Dietary intake and adher-
ence to diets was assessed every 3 months with a 7-day food
recordandanalyzedusingNutritionistProsoftware(AxxyaSys-
tems LLC). Intervention participants were considered to be ad-
herent when their actual energy intake, determined via food
records, was within 200 kcal of their prescribed daily energy
goal.
Blood samples were obtained following a 12-hour fast ev-
ery 6 months (collected on the morning after a feast day for
the alternate-day fasting group). Secondary outcomes in-
cluded blood pressure, heart rate, and total cholesterol, low-
density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol,triglycerides,fastingglucose,fastinginsulin,C-reactive
protein, and homocysteine concentrations (analytical meth-
ods are detailed in the full protocol in Supplement 1). The ho-
meostasis model assessment of insulin resistance was calcu-
lated as insulin × glucose/405, where the unit of measure for
insulin is in micro-international units per milliliter and the unit
of measure for glucose is milligrams per deciliter.23
Statistical Analysis
For the sample size calculation, we estimated that alternate-
day fasting would reduce body weight by 15% by month 69,11
and that daily calorie restriction would reduce body weight by
10%bymonth6.24Wecalculatedthat26participantspergroup
would provide 80% power to detect a significant difference of
5%inbodyweightbetweenthealternate-dayfastinggroupand
the daily calorie restriction group at month 6, using a 2-tailed
independent-samplesttestwithα = .05.Weanticipatedadrop-
out rate of 12%. Thus, we initially aimed to recruit 90 partici-
pants (30 per group), assuming that 78 participants (26 per
group) would complete the trial. We later decided to recruit
100 participants to increase our statistical power because our
dropout rate was higher than expected.
Data are shown as mean values (with 95% CIs) unless oth-
erwisenoted.A2-tailedP < .05wasconsideredstatisticallysig-
nificant. Tests for normality were included in the model, and
all data were found to be normally distributed. We conducted
anintention-to-treatanalysis,whichincludeddatafromall100
participants who underwent randomization. Results are re-
ported by intention-to-treat analysis unless indicated other-
wise. A linear mixed model was used to assess time, diet, and
time × diet effects for each outcome. This model provides un-
biasedestimatesoftimeandtreatmenteffectsunderamissing-
at-random assumption. Time was not assumed to be linear in
themodel.Thisstrategyallowedforestimationoftimeanddiet

On the fast day (Figure 2A), participants in the alternate-day
fasting group exceeded their prescribed energy goal at months
3 and 6. On the feast day (Figure 2B), participants in the alter-

 rie restriction group were adherent to their energy goals at
months3,6,9,and12relativetothoseinthealternate-dayfast-
ing group.
Percentage Energy Restriction Determined
via Doubly Labeled Water
From baseline to month 6, the alternate-day fasting group
achieved a mean (SD) percentage energy restriction of 21%
(16%), and the daily calorie restriction group achieved a mean
(SD) percentage energy restriction of 24% (16%), with no sig-
nificant difference between the intervention groups or com-
pared with the control group (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Physical Activity and Dietary Intake
Data on dietary intake are displayed in eTable 1 in Supplement
2.Percentageofenergyintakefromfat,carbohydrates,andpro-
tein did not differ significantly over time in any of the groups.
Physical activity, measured as steps per day, did not change
during the course of the trial in any group (eTable 2 in
Supplement 2). This level of activity is approximately 1000 to
2000 steps per day higher than that of the average over-
weight or obese adult.25
Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance
Changes in body weight are displayed in Figure 3 and Table 2.
Weight loss was not significantly different between the alter-
nate-day fasting group and the daily calorie restriction group
at month 6. At the end of the study, total weight loss was –6.0%
(95% CI, –8.5% to –3.6%) for the alternate-day fasting group
and –5.3% (95% CI, –7.6% to –3.0%) for the daily calorie re-
striction group, relative to controls, with no significant differ-
ence between the intervention groups. Weight regain from
months 6 to 12 (–0.8%; 95% CI, –3.2% to 1.7%) was not signifi-
cantly different between the alternate-day fasting group and
the daily calorie restriction group. Moreover, weight regain
from months 6 to 12 was not significantly different between
the alternate-day fasting group and controls (0.8%; 95% CI,
–1.8% to 3.3%), or the daily calorie restriction group and con-
trols (1.5%; 95% CI, –0.8% to 3.9%). Changes in body compo-
sition are reported in Table 2. There were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between the alternate-day fasting group
and the daily calorie restriction group for fat mass, lean mass,
or visceral fat mass at month 6 or month 12.
Blood Pressure and Heart Rate
Blood pressure was not significantly different between the in-
tervention groups, or relative to controls, at month 6 or month
12 (Table 2). There were also no statistically significant differ-
encesinheartratebetweenthealternate-dayfastinggroupand
the daily calorie restriction group at month 6 or month 12
(Table 2).
Plasma Lipids
Changes in plasma lipids during the course of the trial are
shown in Table 2. Total cholesterol levels were not signifi-
cantly different between the intervention groups, or relative
to controls, at month 6 or month 12. At month 6, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated in the
alternate-day fasting group by 6.2 mg/dL (95% CI, 0.1-12.4 mg/
dL) (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) vs
the daily calorie restriction group, but this effect was no lon-
ger observed by month 12. Low-density lipoprotein choles-

controls, at month 6 or month 12. There were also no signifi-
cant differences in fasting insulin or the homeostasis model
assessment of insulin resistance between the inter-
vention groups at month 6 or month 12. High-sensitivity
C-reactive protein and homocysteine levels did not differ
significantly between the intervention groups, or relative to
controls, at month 6 or month 12. We also performed a
sensitivity analysis, in which sex and race/ethnicity were
included as adjustment covariates in the intention-to-treat
mixed model. The inclusion of sex and race/ethnicity did
not affect any of the estimated treatment effects reported in
Table 2.
Discussion
The results of this randomized clinical trial demonstrated that
alternate-day fasting did not produce superior adherence,
weight loss, weight maintenance, or improvement in risk in-
dicators for cardiovascular disease compared with daily calo-
rie restriction.
Alternate-day fasting has been promoted as a potentially
superior alternative to daily calorie restriction under the as-
sumption that it is easier to restrict calories every other day.
However, our data from food records, doubly labeled water,
and regular weigh-ins indicate that this assumption is not the

 case. Rather, it appears as though many participants in the al-
ternate-day fasting group converted their diet into de facto
calorie restriction as the trial progressed. Moreover, the drop-
out rate in the alternate-day fasting group (38%) was higher
than that in the daily calorie restriction group (29%) and the
control group (26%). It was also shown that more partici-
pantsinthealternate-dayfastinggroupwithdrewowingtodis-
satisfaction with diet compared with those in the daily calo-
rie restriction group (Figure 1). Taken together, these findings
suggest that alternate-day fasting may be less sustainable in
the long term, compared with daily calorie restriction, for most
obese individuals. Nevertheless, it is still possible that a cer-
tain smaller segment of obese individuals may prefer this pat-
tern of energy restriction instead of daily restriction. It will be
of interest to examine what behavioral traits (eg, ability to go
for long periods without eating) make alternate-day fasting
more tolerable for some individuals than others.
Toourknowledge,thepresentstudyisthelongestandlarg-
est trial of alternate-day fasting to date. Previous trials of al-
ternate-day fasting reported weight loss of 3% to 7% after 2 to
3 months of diet.7-13 Adherence was measured in several pre-
vioustrialsandwasshowntobehigh(eg,participantsmettheir
calorie goals on approximately 80%-90% of fast days).7,8,10,11
Most of these past studies provided food on the fast day,7,8,10,11
so the provision of food is not a confounder when comparing
past findings with present findings. Food was provided to the
intervention participants during the first 3 months of the
weight-loss phase to promote adherence26 and show partici-
pants the types and quantities of foods that they should be eat-
ing. Data from the food records indicated that participants fre-
quently ate extra “nonstudy” foods that were purchased from
stores or restaurants. This finding suggests that limiting ca-
loric intake to approximately 500 kcal every other day may
have been difficult for many participants early in the inter-
vention. Future work in this area should examine whether this
lack of adherence to alternate-day fasting is due to cognitive,
environmental,and/orphysiologicalfactors.Forinstance,mea-
suring changes in subjective appetite (hunger and fullness) in

 conjunction with modulations in appetite hormones (ghre-
lin, peptide YY, and glucagon-like peptide-1) could offer some
insight into why daily calorie restriction may allow for easier
adherence compared with alternate-day fasting.
Contrary to our original hypotheses, the participants in the
alternate-day fasting group did not experience more pro-
nounced improvements in risk indicators for cardiovascular
disease compared with the participants in the daily calorie re-
striction group. However, the trial included primarily meta-
bolically healthy obese adults. Since many of the participants
had normal cholesterol levels and normal blood pressure at
baseline, it is not surprising that most risk indicators for car-
diovascular disease did not change in response to diet.
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, the duration of the
maintenance phase was short (6 months). Second, the control
group was imperfect, in that they received no food, no coun-
seling, and less attention from study personnel, relative to the
intervention groups, which may have confounded our find-
ings. We also failed to include the control group in our initial
power calculation. Third, since the dropout rate was higher
than anticipated, our power to detect the hypothesized differ-
ence of 5% weight loss between the intervention groups at
month 6 decreased from 80% to 60%. The higher dropout
rate in the alternate-day fasting group may have also intro-
duced a possible selection bias between groups.27 Finally, we
enrolled predominantly metabolically healthy obese indi-
viduals, which may have hindered the abilities of the inter-
ventions to produce greater improvements in our measured
cardiovascular disease risk indicators.28,29 The generalizabil-
ity of our findings is also limited by the enrollment.
