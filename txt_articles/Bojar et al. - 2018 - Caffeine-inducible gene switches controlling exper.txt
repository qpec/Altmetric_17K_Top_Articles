Programming cellular behavior using trigger-inducible gene switches is integral to synthetic
biology. Although significant progress has been achieved in trigger-induced transgene
expression, side-effect-free remote control of transgenes continues to challenge cell-based
therapies. Here, utilizing a caffeine-binding single-domain antibody we establish a caffeine-
inducible protein dimerization system, enabling synthetic transcription factors and cell-
surface receptors that enable transgene expression in response to physiologically relevant
concentrations of caffeine generated by routine intake of beverages such as tea and coffee.

C-STAR-equipped cells for caffeine-sensitive expression of glucagon-like peptide 1 showed
substantially improved glucose homeostasis after coffee consumption compared to untreated
mice. Biopharmaceutical production control by caffeine, which is non-toxic, inexpensive and
only present in specific beverages, is expected to improve patient compliance by integrating
therapy with lifestyle.

n recent years, synthetic biology, the fusion between engi-
neering and biology1, has brought the rational and predictable
construction of sophisticated gene circuits into the forefront of
biomedical research. Plug-and-play combinations of carefully
designed biological modules have enabled major advances in
therapies for personalized medicine2,3, as well as in the challen-
ging endeavor of lineage control4,5, bringing achievements in the
laboratory ever closer to rewarding real-world applications6,7. In
this context, cell-based therapies capitalizing on the complexity of
mammalian cells are taking the lead in the advent of personalized
medicine8, as exemplified by applications of chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)—T cells9 or designer cell implants to treat var-
ious common diseases2,10.
Controlling the dynamics of gene expression is essential for the
functionality of synthetic gene circuits. This is especially relevant
in synthetic biology-inspired therapies, where gene expression
regulation determines the dosage of the produced therapeutic and
allows for considerable control over the designer cell implant.
Therefore, gene expression in most circuits is controlled either at
the transcriptional or translational level. At the transcriptional
level, promoters responsive to specific triggers are controlled by
transcription factors11, whereas at the translational level, ribo-
zymes or riboswitches responsive to specific triggers control
protein translation12. In recent years, the quest for better inducers
has progressed rapidly. Initially, antibiotics such as tetracycline or
doxycycline13 were used for the control of gene expression,
raising issues such as antibiotic resistance14 and side effects15.
The next generation of inducers were designed to be safe and
orthogonal, such as the apple tree leaf metabolite phloretin16 or
the food additives benzoate and vanillic acid17. However, these
inducers still suffer from potential side effects, especially in long-
term applications, and have to be exogenously added. Traceless
inducers, such as light18 or temperature19, have recently been
developed, but ambient light and ambient temperature make
them less orthogonal than would be desirable. The ideal inducer
would be inexpensive, would have no side effects, and would be
present in only a specific set of known sources.
Here, we report a bioengineering approach for the induction of
gene expression in mammalian designer cells by caffeine. The
small molecule caffeine is non-toxic20, cheap to produce21, and
only present in specific beverages, such as coffee and tea. Every
day, more than two billion cups of coffee are being consumed
worldwide, making coffee one of the most popular beverages after
water, and one of the most important cash crops in the world22.
Currently available caffeine-responsive gene switches require
enzymatic conversion of caffeine to theophylline to provide
translation control in yeast23. However, due to its low sensitivity
the yeast system is unsuitable for sensing physiologically relevant
caffeine concentrations in mammalian cells. To engineer fully
synthetic caffeine-inducible gene switches with user-defined
sensitivity and functionality, we established a caffeine-mediated
protein dimerization system in mammalian cells based on a
single-domain VHH camelid antibody (referred to as aCaffVHH)
that has high affinity (Kd = 500 nM) and homodimerizes in the
presence of caffeine24–26. By fusing aCaffVHH to the intracellular
signaling domains of different mammalian receptor classes, we
created fully synthetic receptors that sense caffeine at physiolo-
gically relevant levels (e.g., the amount provided in a cup of
coffee). The robustness of these caffeine receptors, which we call
C-STAR (caffeine-stimulated advanced regulators), is demon-
strated in vitro with pure caffeine and with a diverse array of
everyday sources of caffeine, such as black tea, coffee, and energy
drinks, as well as in vivo in two mouse models of experimental
Type-2 diabetes.
Type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) affects more than 400 million
people worldwide27 and associated health costs amount to about
825 billion US dollars per year28. As T2D is characterized by a
sustained increase in blood glucose levels after each meal, we
wanted to capture the natural dynamics of caffeine uptake after
each major meal to achieve a novel therapeutic approach to the
acute phase of T2D by using designer cells equipped with C-
STAR to deliver synthetic human glucagon-like peptide 1
(shGLP-1) in response to dietary intake of coffee or other
caffeine-containing beverages. Capitalizing on routine cultural
habits, therapies based on such systems should seamlessly inte-
grate into people’s lifestyle, and therefore could be a key pillar
upon which the new generation of personalized medicine can
build.
Results
Design of a caffeine-inducible gene switch. After drinking an
average cup of coffee, blood levels of caffeine peak in the low
micromolar range29,30, so for the present purpose, we required a
novel caffeine sensor system for non-toxic (Supplementary
Fig. 1), physiologically relevant concentrations. To capture these
concentrations,
we
established
a
caffeine-inducible
protein
dimerization system in mammalian cells to create different types
of gene switches. (i) Fusion of the caffeine-binding single-domain
antibody
aCaffVHH
to
DNA-binding
and
transactivation
domains reconstitutes synthetic transcription factors driving
chimeric target promoters in a caffeine-responsive manner. (ii)
Fusion
of
the
caffeine-binding
single-domain
antibody
aCaffVHH to intracellular signaling domains of different mam-
malian receptor classes reconstitutes synthetic signaling cascades
and
allows
caffeine
to
dose-dependently
activate
different
pathway-specific promoters (Fig. 1a).
To design an aCaffVHH-dependent transcription factor-based
gene switch, we C-terminally fused aCaffVHH to the DNA-
binding TetR-domain (PSV40-TetR-aCaffVHH-pASV40, pDB307),
as well as N-terminally to four repeats of a transactivating
12-amino-acid peptide (VPmin, PCAG-aCaffVHH-VPminx4-pAβG,
pDB335). In this design, the presence of caffeine should dimerize
the DNA-binding domain with the transactivating VPmin domain
and lead to gene expression (Fig. 1b). Utilizing the reporter gene
human placental-secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) controlled
by a TetR-dependent promoter (PtetO7-SEAP-pASV40, pMF111),
we observed clear caffeine-dependent gene expression in the
presence of 100 µM caffeine (Fig. 1b).
We reasoned that this low sensitivity to caffeine might be due
to the absence of signal amplification in this split transcription
factor
setup.
Therefore,
we
applied
the
caffeine-inducible
dimerization system to different signaling pathway-specific signal
transduction domains. First, we fused aCaffVHH N-terminally to
the transmembrane domain of interleukin 13 receptor subunit
alpha 1 (IL13Rα1, PhCMV-aCaffVHH-IL13Rα1-pAbGH, pDB323),
as well as interleukin 4 receptor subunit alpha (IL4Rα, PhCMV-
aCaffVHH-IL4Rα-pAbGH, pDB324). Addition of caffeine should
induce heterodimerization of these receptors and activate signal
transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) signaling.
Indeed, when we co-transfected STAT6 (PhCMV-STAT6-pAbGH,
pLS16) and a STAT6-responsive reporter construct (PSTAT6-
SEAP-pASV40, pLS12), we could see caffeine-dependent gene
expression starting from 1 µM caffeine (Fig. 1c), a considerable
improvement in sensitivity compared to the split transcription
factor setup using pDB307 and pDB335. However, the absolute
output strength of this setup in SEAP units was limited,
necessitating a more powerful system.
To overcome the output strength issue, we fused aCaffVHH C-
terminally to the intracellular part of the murine fibroblast
growth factor receptor 1 (mFGFR1, PhCMV-mFGFR1405-822-
aCaffVHH-pAbGH, pDB395)31. The presence of caffeine should

 homodimerize mFGFR1405-822-aCaffVHH and lead to MAPK
signaling, which we re-routed to TetR-dependent pMF111 by
co-transfecting TetR-Elk1 (PhCMV-TetR-Elk1-pAbGH, MKp37).
The signal amplification of the MAPK signaling cascade32 yielded
a strong and sensitive gene expression response in the presence of
as little as 0.01 µM caffeine (Fig. 1d). However, this extraordinary
sensitivity to caffeine may be detrimental in a therapeutic setting,
since even trace amounts of caffeine would induce the gene
circuit.
Additionally,
the
requirement
of
the
re-routing protein TetR-Elk1 meant that transfection of three
plasmids was necessary for this system.
Improving on the mFGFR1-dependent system, we fused
aCaffVHH N-terminally to an erythropoietin receptor derivative
(EpoR, PhCMV-aCaffVHH-EpoRm-IL-6RBm-pAbGH, pDB306)33,34,
leading to homodimerization of the receptor in the presence of
caffeine and subsequent JAK/STAT signaling through STAT3. As
HEK-293T cells endogenously express STAT3, we only needed to
transfect pDB306 and a STAT3-dependent reporter plasmid
(PSTAT3-SEAP-pASV40, pLS13). This setup yielded a strong and
sensitive gene expression system with a maximal response at 1
µM caffeine (Fig. 1e).

 Overall, caffeine-dependent STAT3-signaling proved to be the
best fit in terms of potency, sensitivity to physiological caffeine
levels, and number of components, and so it was used for all
further experiments. Due to receptor homodimerization and
endogenous STAT3 expression, we only needed to transfect two
components to obtain a full C-STAR system. Since the presented
gene expression systems had different sensitivities and relied on
orthogonal promoters, they could be used for endowing designer
cells with a nonlinear response to caffeine by expressing multiple
receptors (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).
Characterization of the caffeine-inducible C-STAR system.
Functionality of the C-STAR system was also demonstrated in
human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized human
mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC-hTERT) (Fig. 2a). However,
HEK-293T cells showing higher caffeine sensitivity and protein
secretion capacity were used in all follow-up experiments. For
long-term
experiments,
the
C-STAR
receptor
(PhEF-1α-
aCaffVHH-EpoRm-IL-6RBm-pASV40, pDB326) was stably inte-
grated into the genome of HEK-293T cells, creating the designer
cell line C-STARDB1. The caffeine dose-response relationship of
this polyclonal cell line was similar to that of the transiently
transfected cells (Fig. 2b). However, selection of monoclonal
C-STAR cell lines yielded clones with different sensitivities for
caffeine (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d). All further in vitro experi-
ments were conducted with the C-STARDB1 cell line.
To capture the time window of high caffeine concentration in
the blood, an in vivo C-STAR system would need to induce gene
expression after brief exposure to the inducer. Exposure to
physiologically relevant concentrations of caffeine induced a half-
maximal response of the C-STAR system within just one hour,
and a maximal response was obtained after six hours of exposure
(Fig. 2c). Since the half-life of caffeine in human blood is
approximately five hours30, in vivo activation of the C-STAR
system by caffeine should be feasible. Among the caffeine analogs
tested in vitro, only theophylline showed modest cross-activation
of C-STAR at 1 µM concentration (Supplementary Fig. 4), which
is unlikely to be reached in the physiological situation35,36. The
response time of the C-STAR system after caffeine addition was
assessed and the C-STAR system responded in a timely manner
to the presence of caffeine, yielding detectable amounts of
reporter protein at 12 h, whereas no induction of SEAP
expression was seen in the negative control lacking caffeine
(Fig. 2d). Testing the reversibility of the gene circuit, C-STARDB1
cells were incubated with physiologically relevant concentrations
of caffeine or the equivalent amount of H2O (mock), with an
exchange of caffeine to mock, or vice versa, every day (Fig. 2e). As
expected, the system was shut off by the removal of caffeine and
could be activated again by the renewed addition of caffeine to the
cells, indicating reversibility after removal or degradation of
caffeine.

C-STAR. Caffeine is a component of various beverages. There-
fore, to broaden the range of available beverages for the induction
of the C-STAR system, and to establish the specificity of the
synthetic
biology-inspired
caffeine-sensing
system,
C-STARDB1 cells were challenged with 26 products, including
Nespresso Grand Cru®, Starbucks® coffee, Red Bull®, Cuida
Te® tea capsule, and Coca-Cola® (Fig. 3a). Several Nespresso
Grand Cru® capsules were also tested in their decaffeinated ver-
sion as negative controls (Vivalto lungo decaffeinato®, Volluto
decaffeinato®, Decaffeinato intenso®, and Arpeggio decaffeinato®).
As three of these beverage samples also have caffeinated versions
(Vivalto lungo®, Volluto®, and Arpeggio®), which are claimed by
the manufacturer to be identical to the respective decaffeinated
versions except for the caffeine content, they allowed us to con-
firm that caffeine itself upregulates gene expression and not any
other of the hundreds of chemical compounds present in coffee22.
Overall, our beverage samples covered a wide range of caffeine
concentrations
from
0
to
4.8 g L−1.
A
standard
dose-response curve was obtained with pure caffeine. This
enabled us to convert the SEAP values from C-STARDB1 cells
incubated with beverage samples into caffeine concentrations.
For all samples tested, caffeine concentrations indicated by the
vendor corresponded well to those measured with C-STARDB1
cells (Fig. 3b, c). As expected, decaffeinated beverage samples
showed very low activation of the C-STAR system (Fig. 3b, c).
These results indicate that C-STAR reproducibly generates a
dose-dependent, caffeine-specific response.
C-STAR treatment for obesity-induced Type-2 diabetes. The
functionality of the designed C-STAR system in vascularized
microcontainers was first confirmed in vitro with pure caffeine
(Supplementary Fig. 5). After validating the immunoprotective
function of microcapsule implants for drug delivery in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. 6), mice implanted with the designer cell
capsules were given room temperature Volluto® coffee (Nespresso
Grand Cru®), or H2O to drink. As expected, only mice grafted
with the C-STAR system showed reversible, coffee-induced SEAP
expression (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b). The same mice were re-
stimulated a few days later and showed the same response as in
the initial experiment (Supplementary Fig. 7c, d).
Next, in order to examine whether this system could be utilized
for caffeine-induced treatment of obesity-induced T2D, we
replaced the reporter gene SEAP with the gene coding for

the reporter gene SEAP (PSTAT6-SEAP-pASV40, pLS12). d Caffeine-sensing circuit based on the MAPK pathway. Caffeine-induced homodimerization of
mFGFR1405-822-aCaffVHH (pDB395) led to phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and downstream signaling of the MAPK cascade. Rewiring the signaling cascade
through the hybrid transcription factor TetR-Elk1 (MKp37) led to expression of the reporter gene SEAP (PtetO7-SEAP-pASV40, pMF111), enabling
quantification of the caffeine dose-response relationship. e Caffeine-sensing circuit based on the Epo receptor and the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Caffeine-

ments in vitro with the C-STARDB6 cell line incorporating the
resulting construct validated the caffeine-dependent expression of

(Fig. 4f).
Discussion
The C-STAR system developed here extends previous efforts23 to
induce gene expression with caffeine by enabling engineered
mammalian cells to directly sense caffeine at physiologically
relevant concentrations, thereby making it possible to fine-tune
therapeutic transgene expression in response to routine intake of
beverages, such as tea and coffee without supplementation of any
additional chemicals. Receptor setups with differing sensitivity
(Fig. 1), as well as different monoclonal cell lines generated from
the C-STARDB1 system (Supplementary Fig. 3), could be useful to
accommodate different lifestyles of patients, who may consume
different amounts of caffeine per day. As the C-STAR system
responds dose-dependently to caffeine, a variety of caffeine-
containing beverages, ranging from coffee or tea to energy drinks,
can be used to trigger the system. Importantly, decaffeinated
coffee did not activate the C-STAR system, so C-STAR-treated
patients could still enjoy decaffeinated drinks without activating
their implants. Additionally, coffee capsules such as Nespresso
Grand Cru® are highly standardized and could allow for pre-
dictable dosing. The persistence, efficacy, and immunoprotective
functions of alginate-based microcontainers used in this study
have already been demonstrated in diabetes clinical trials, paving
the way for the application of C-STAR cells in humans43.
Potential side effects of caffeine are minimal and well known,
even in the case of lifelong consumption44,45. Indeed, normal
doses of caffeine in the form of coffee are reported to have health
benefits46–49. Even caffeine doses of up to 400 mg per day have no
adverse effect in adults20, so that a broad range of caffeine con-
sumption is available for the control of C-STAR cells. As a natural

 ingredient of beverages, caffeine (unlike most other chemical
inducers) is a popular stimulant consumed by a large proportion
of the population50. Caffeine is cheap and easily synthesized21,
making it far more cost-effective than, for instance, non-
immunosuppressive analogs of the popular inducer rapamy-
cin51. Major causes of patient noncompliance (i.e., failure of
patients to follow medication instructions)52 are complicated
instructions, forgetfulness, and disruption of lifestyle53. As even
prevalent diseases, such as Type-2 diabetes, are associated with
high levels of noncompliance54, an inducer that is present in
routinely consumed beverages could be highly beneficial. On all
these grounds, we think caffeine is a promising candidate in the
quest for the most suitable inducer of gene expression. Addi-
tionally, we think that the caffeine-dimerizable single-domain
antibody aCaffVHH will be a valuable addition to the range of
small-molecule-mediated-dimerization kits due to its small size,
high affinity for caffeine, and the feasibility of using it intra-
cellularly, as well as extracellularly in any fusion orientation.
Personalized medicine, the custom-tailored interplay between
diagnostics and therapy, has long been predicted55, but still
remains on the horizon. To achieve truly personalized treatment,
designed systems need to be highly tunable, so that they can easily
be adapted to each individual patient and his or her lifestyle. Any
lifestyle disruption would not only impair the quality of life of the
patient, but also increase the chances of noncompliance. We
believe the tunability and sensitivity of the synthetic biology-
inspired C-STAR systems developed here meet these require-
ments, and these systems are promising candidates for the control
of T2D. It is also worth noting that the C-STAR system could
even be used as an in vitro caffeine-quantifying device for patients
suffering from caffeine hypersensitivity56.
Methods
Plasmid construction. See table in Supplementary Data 1.
Cell culture. Human embryonic kidney cells (ATCC: CRL3216, HEK-293T) and
adipose tissue-derived human telomerase reverse transcriptase-immortalized
human mesenchymal stem cells (ATCC: SCRC4000, hMSC-hTERT) were cultured
in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS; BioConcept, Allschwil,
Switzerland; lot no. 022M3395) and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin solution
(Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany). All cells were cultured in a humidified
atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cell viability and number was assessed
with an electric field multi-channel cell-counting device (CASY Cell Counter and
Analyzer Model TT; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Basel, Switzerland). For transfection
in a 24-well plate format, 500 ng of plasmid DNA were diluted in 50 µL FCS-free
DMEM, mixed with 2.5 µL polyethyleneimine (PEI; Polysciences Inc.; 1 mg mL−1),
and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Then, the transfection mixture was
added dropwise to 1.25 × 105 cells seeded 12 h before transfection. Twelve hours
after transfection, the transfection medium was replaced by standard culture
medium or medium supplemented with caffeine (cat. No. C0750, Sigma-Aldrich)
or caffeine-containing compounds. Transgene expression was profiled 24 h later.
Generation of genetically stable designer cell lines. To develop stable designer
cell lines according to the Sleeping Beauty transposon protocol57, one well of a 6-
well plate with HEK-293T cells was co-transfected with pDB326 (1900 ng)/
pSB100x (100 ng). After 12 h, the transfection medium was exchanged for standard
culture medium. After an additional 24 h, the medium was exchanged for standard
culture medium supplemented with 1 µg mL−1 puromycin (cat. no. A1113803;
ThermoFisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland) and a polyclonal cell population
(C-STARDB1) was selected for 2 weeks. Subsequently, single cells were sorted by
FACS according to fluorescence intensity, and single clones were grown in

 conditioned HEK-293T culture medium. Monoclonal cell populations were
screened for caffeine-responsive SEAP expression and CSTARDB3 was chosen as
the best performer. The polyclonal stable cell line C-STARDB6 was similarly gen-
erated with the plasmid pDB387, using 100 µg mL−1 zeocin (cat. no. R25005;
ThermoFisher Scientific, Reinach, Switzerland) as the selecting reagent.
CCK-8 assay. Cell viability was quantified with the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8;
Dojindo Laboratories; cat. no. CK04) according to the manufacturer’s instructions
in Corning® 96 black well plates with a clear bottom (cat. no. CLS3603,
Sigma-Aldrich). Briefly, 12 h after transfection, standard culture medium supple-
mented with or without caffeine was added to the cells. After 24 h, the medium was
exchanged for standard culture medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) Cell
Counting Kit-8. After an incubation period of one hour at 37 °C, absorbance was
measured at 450 nm with an EnVision 2104 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer),
yielding a surrogate for cell viability.
SEAP assay. For the quantification of human placental-secreted alkaline phos-
phatase (SEAP), cell culture supernatant was heat-inactivated for 30 min at 65 °C.
Then, 80 µL supernatant was mixed with 100 µL 2 × SEAP buffer (20 mM homo-
arginine, 1 mM MgCl2, 21% (v/v) diethanolamine, pH 9.8) and 20 μL of substrate
solution containing 20 mM pNPP (Acros Organics BVBA). Measurement was then
performed at 405 nm using an EnVision 2104 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer).
SEAP production in vivo was quantified with the chemiluminescence SEAP
reporter gene assay (cat. no. 11779842001, Sigma-Aldrich) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Mouse IgG ELISA. Mouse IgG levels in samples containing shGLP1-mIgG were
quantified using the Mouse IgG ELISA Kit (cat. no. E-90G, ICL Lab), according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was quantified at 450 nm with an
EnVision 2104 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer) and the mouse IgG levels were
interpolated with a standard curve.
Glucose tolerance test. Mice were challenged by intraperitoneal injection of
glucose (2 g kg−1 body weight in H2O) and the glycemic profiles were generated by
measurement of blood glucose levels with a glucometer (Contour® Next; Bayer
HealthCare, Leverkusen, Germany) every 15 or 30 min for 120 min.
Insulin ELISA. Insulin blood levels in tested mice were assessed with the Ultra-
sensitive Mouse Insulin ELISA (cat. no. 10-1132-01, Mercodia) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was quantified at 450 nm with an
EnVision 2104 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer).
shGLP-1 ELISA. Blood levels of GLP-1 in tested mice were measured with the High
Sensitivity GLP-1 Active ELISA Kit, Chemiluminescent (cat. no. EZGLPHS-35K,
Merck) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The absorbance was quan-
tified at 450 nm with an EnVision 2104 multilabel reader (PerkinElmer).
Caffeine samples. Coffee (Nespresso Grand Cru®) and tea samples (Cuida Te®)
were prepared on a Nespresso Capri Automatic Sand machine (Koenig®). Star-
bucks coffee samples were obtained from a local Starbucks®. Coca-Cola® and Red
Bull® samples were purchased from a local supermarket. Nesquik® (Nescafé Dolce
Gusto®) was prepared on a Circolo Automatic EDG605B EX:1 (Nescafé Dolce
Gusto®, DeLonghi). Military energy gum® (MarketRight Inc.) was mechanically
crushed, covered with 40 mL water, and shaken for several hours at 37 °C to
simulate chewing. Unless indicated otherwise, volumes of prepared beverages were
those recommended by the respective manufacturer. All samples were diluted
1:50,000 in standard culture medium and added to the designer cells for quanti-
fication of caffeine.
Animal experiments. Encapsulated HEK-293T and C-STAR-derivative cells for
the intraperitoneal implants were generated with an Inotech Encapsulator Research
Unit IE-50R (EncapBioSystems Inc., Greifensee, Switzerland). Coherent alginate-
poly-(L-lysine)-beads (400 µm diameter, 500 cells per capsule) were generated with
the following parameters: 200-µm nozzle with a vibration frequency of 1025 Hz;
25-mL syringe operated at a flow rate of 410 units; 1.12 kV bead dispersion
voltage58. Female C57BL/6 (14 weeks old) or T2D mice were injected with 1–2 mL
of serum-free DMEM containing 1 × 104 capsules. As genetically disposed T2D
mice, db/db mice (female, 8 weeks old) were purchased from Janvier Labs. For the
diet-induced obesity (DIO) model of T2D, C57BL/6 J mice (Janvier Labs, female,
4 weeks old) were fed for 10 weeks with a 10-kcal% or a 60-kcal% fat diet (TestDiet,
cat. no. T-58Y1-58126) before C-STAR-controlled treatment. Blood glucose con-
centration was measured with a glucometer (Contour® Next; Bayer HealthCare,
Leverkusen, Germany). Serum was collected using microtainer serum separating
tubes (cat. no. 365967; Becton Dickinson, Plymouth, UK) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. Experiments involving animals were carried out in
accordance with the directive of the European Union by Ghislaine Charpin-El
Hamri (No. 69266309; project No. DR2013–01 (v2)) at the Institut Universitaire de
Technologie, UCB Lyon 1, F-69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France.
