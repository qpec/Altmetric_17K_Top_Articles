BACKGROUND & AIMS: Incidence of and mortality from
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the most common
form of pancreatic cancer, are almost equivalent, so better
treatments are needed. We studied gene expression profiles of
PDACs and the functions of genes with altered expression to
identify new therapeutic targets. METHODS: We performed
microarray analysis to analyze gene expression profiles of 195
PDAC and 41 non-tumor pancreatic tissue samples. We
undertook an extensive analysis of the PDAC transcriptome by
superimposing interaction networks of proteins encoded by
aberrantly expressed genes over signaling pathways associ-
ated with PDAC development to identify factors that might
alter regulation of these pathways during tumor progression.
We performed tissue microarray analysis to verify changes in
expression of candidate protein using an independent set of
152 samples (40 nontumor pancreatic tissues, 63 PDAC sec-
tions, and 49 chronic pancreatitis samples). We validated the
functional relevance of the candidate molecule using RNA
interference or pharmacologic inhibitors in pancreatic cancer
cell lines and analyses of xenograft tumors in mice. RESULTS:
In an analysis of 38,276 human genes and loci, we identi-
fied 1676 genes that were significantly up-regulated and
1166 genes that were significantly down-regulated in PDAC
compared with nontumor pancreatic tissues. One gene that
was up-regulated and associated with multiple signaling
pathways that are dysregulated in PDAC was G protein sub-
unit ai2, which has not been previously associated with PDAC.
G protein subunit ai2 mediates the effects of dopamine re-
ceptor

signaling; PDAC tissues had a slight but significant increase in
DRD2 messenger RNA. Levels of DRD2 protein were sub-
stantially increased in PDACs, compared with non-tumor
tissues, in tissue microarray analyses. RNA interference
knockdown of DRD2 or inhibition with pharmacologic antag-
onists (pimozide and haloperidol) reduced proliferation of
pancreatic cancer cells, induced endoplasmic reticulum stress
and apoptosis, and reduced cell migration. RNA interference
knockdown of DRD2 in pancreatic tumor cells reduced growth
of xenograft tumors in mice, and administration of the DRD2
inhibitor haloperidol to mice with orthotopic xenograft tu-
mors reduced final tumor size and metastasis. CONCLUSIONS:
In gene expression profile analysis of PDAC samples, we
found the DRD2 signaling pathway to be activated. Inhibition
of DRD2 in pancreatic cancer cells reduced proliferation and
migration, and slowed growth of xenograft tumors in mice.

BASIC AND
TRANSLATIONAL PANCREAS
 pancreatic cancer, approximately 85% exhibit pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC); most of them die within 6
months after diagnosis. The poor prognosis is caused by a
lack of apparent symptoms early during the disease and
consequently its detection at only late stages. This goes
along with an aggressive tumor biology, in particular, very
early metastasis. Finally, effective options for chemotherapy
are lacking.2 The widely used chemotherapeutic agent
gemcitabine confers a median survival advantage of only 6
months,3
also
because
the
vast
majority
of
patients
develop resistance to therapy.4 Given this poor prospect,
there is an urgent need for effective treatment modalities.
To this end, we set out to investigate potential therapeutic
targets by dissecting gene expression profiles of tumors
and control samples. Candidate targets were validated with
respect to their suitability and analyzed functionally. Using
this approach, dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) was found as
a novel, promising protein for the development of a
targeted therapy. We show that DRD2 has a central role in
proliferation and survival of pancreatic cancer cells. Phar-
macologic
blockade
of
DRD2
activity
with
inhibitors,
including
the
Food
and
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
approved DRD2 antagonists pimozide and haloperidol,
suppressed the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells,
while having a markedly attenuated effect on normal
fibroblasts. Further functional assays demonstrated sub-
stantial effects on migration, cell cycle progression and
apoptosis as well, providing a broad therapeutic spectrum,
and revealed the pathways and mechanisms involved in
these processes.

negative control. Lentivirus production is described in the
Supplementary Material.
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase
Chain Reaction
For mice xenograft tissue samples and cultured cells, the
miRNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used to extract total
RNA. Reverse transcription was done using the Maxima First
Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit for RT-qPCR (Thermo Scientific
Rockford, Logan, UT). Real-time polymerase chain reaction was
run using the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Bio-
systems, Darmstadt, Germany) and the FastStart Universal
SYBR

according
to
the
manufacturers’
specifications.
Relative messenger RNA levels of DRD2 were normalized to
the expression of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Quantification values were calcu-
lated according to a standard curve method created from a
dilution series. Polymerase chain reactions were performed in
triplicate.

In Vivo Experiments
Severe combined immunodeficient beige mice were bred
in-house. One million Panc-1 cell transduced with shDRD2#1,
shDRD2#2, or pLKO were suspended in 150 mL phosphate-
buffered saline and mixed with 150 mL Matrigel (BD Bio-
sciences, San Jose, CA) before the respective suspension was
injected subcutaneously into the left and right flank of a mouse.
For each test cell line, 3 mice were injected with cells in both
flanks. Tumor size was determined twice a week using a caliper
to measure the volume of the tumor according to the formula:
volume (V) ¼ length (L) � depth (D) � width (W). After
reaching the appropriate volume, primary tumors were resec-
ted. In case of pLKO, this happened on day 51 after injection;
for shDRD2#1 and shDRD2#2 the tumor was removed after 65
days. Tumors were embedded in paraffin after zinc fixation for
immunohistochemistry and H&E staining, or stored at �80�C
for RNA extraction.
Two million MIAPaCa-2 cells resuspended in 10 mL Matrigel
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) were orthotopically implanted
into the tail of the pancreas of 6-week-old Nod scid gamma
animals (Jackson Labs, Bar Harbor, ME) (day 1). When tumors
were palpable (day 27), mice were randomized into 2 groups
(n ¼ 7 in control group and n ¼ 9 in haloperidol group) and
injected intraperitoneally with either haloperidol (10 mg/kg)
or solvent (dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] control group) for 12
days. The experiment was terminated when control mice
appeared moribund. Weight of the animal and final tumor
weight and volume were measured. The studies were approved
by the Animal Care Committee of McGill University Faculty of
Medicine.
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Software 6 for Windows (GraphPad, San Diego,
CA), SigmaPlot 12.5 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA) and
Microsoft Excel 2010 (Redmond, WA) were used for statistical
analysis and graph creation. Data are presented as mean

Gene Expression Profiling Identifies Pancreatic
Ductal Adenocarcinoma�Associated Pathways
We examined the expression profiles of 38,276 human
genes and loci across pancreatic tissue samples from 195
PDAC patients and 41 healthy control subjects (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table 1; the complete data set is accessible
at the public ArrayExpress database [E-MTAB-1791]). This
analysis revealed widespread deregulation of gene expres-
sion in PDAC, including 1676 and 1166 genes that were
substantially up- or down-regulated in PDAC, respectively
(false discovery rate <0.01, Supplementary Table 2).
Interestingly, we found that many up-regulated genes were
associated with several cancer-related pathways according
to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes6 data sets,
with the most significant association corresponding to
“pathways in cancer” (P < 5 � 10�9; Figure 1A and

 Supplementary Table 3). Many of the genes associated with
“pathways in cancer” were also linked to other PDAC-
enriched processes (Figure 1B), suggesting a central role
for these “multipathway” genes as potential functional hubs
contributing to PDAC. This was further supported by several
previous studies that reported a connection between these
genes and pancreatic cancer (Figure 1B and references
provided in Supplementary Table 4), highlighting the notion
that many of these multipathway genes are reproducibly
linked to PDAC.
One of the PDAC-related multipathway genes was
guanine nucleotide binding protein a inhibiting activity
polypeptide 2 (GNAI2). Surprisingly, we did not find any
previous report about a connection of GNAI2 and pancreatic
cancer, despite its clear up-regulation in PDAC (P < 3 � 10�12,
fold-change >2) and its association with 9 PDAC-related
pathways. GNAI2 is an a subunit of the guanine nucleotide-
binding proteins (G proteins) and primarily functions in
G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling by regulation of
adenylate cyclase.7 In addition, we observed that GNAI2

the “pathways in cancer” annotation. For each gene, the total number of up-regulated PDAC pathways is indicated. Genes that
were previously reported to have association with pancreatic cancer, or to have a pancreatic cancer-associated homolog,
are marked (see Supplementary Table 4 for a list of publications related to each gene). (C) GNAI2, as the top multipathway
candidate for pancreatic cancer that has not been previously implicated, directly interacts with several other PDAC
de-regulated proteins, the majority of which are also up-regulated. Most interactions are with other components of the
GPCR signaling pathway. Among the up-regulated interacting partners in this signaling pathway, DRD2 is an aberration
hub, with a significant proportion of its first and second-degree neighbors being up-regulated in PDAC samples. Other
aberration hubs are also identified by their names. (D) Immunohistochemical analysis of DRD2 protein levels in PDAC
samples on tissue microarrays. Representative examples of DRD2 expression in duct cells of normal pancreas, CP and
PDAC are shown. Normal ductal cells were almost DRD2-negative or showed a mild positivity in pancreatic ducts. CP
lesions and PDACs represented moderate/strong and strong DRD2 expression, respectively. Sizing bar indicates 100 mm.
(E) The staining intensity was categorized into 4 groups: <1 ¼ no or poor staining (negative); 1 ¼ weak staining; 2 ¼ moderate
staining; and 3 ¼ strong staining. The distribution of DRD2 expression in the clinical tissue samples revealed its
high expression in PDAC (P < 10�13) and CP (P < 10�6) as compared with normal tissues. P values were calculated by Student

GNAI2 Interacting Partner Dopamine Receptor
D2 Is Up-Regulated in Pancreatic Ductal
Adenocarcinoma
GNAI2 couples cell surface receptors to intracellular
pathways, primarily to cAMP signaling.8 In order to identify
cell surface receptors that may take advantage of GNAI2
up-regulation to exert their oncogenic activities in PDAC, we
systematically looked for “aberration hubs” among the
interacting partners of GNAI2 that were up-regulated in
PDAC. An aberration hub is defined as a protein that exhibits
an unexpectedly large number of physical or functional
interactions with “aberrant” proteins; in this case proteins
that are significantly up-regulated in PDAC (see Materials
and Methods). Aberration hubs often highlight proteins that
are central in disease modules.9 We identified 6 significant
aberration hubs among the interacting partners of GNAI2
that are involved in GPCR signaling (false discovery rate
<0.01, Figure 1C). One of them is DRD2, which uses GNAI2
to regulate the cAMP-signaling pathway, the deregulation of
which is intrinsic to pancreatic cancer.10 However, in PDAC
samples, the microarray analysis only identified a slight,
although very significant, increase in DRD2 messenger RNA
levels (1.08-fold; P < .0002). This initially suggested that
low levels of DRD2 could act as a bottleneck in this pathway,
therefore, limiting the effect of GNAI2 up-regulation. How-
ever,

and suggested that DRD2 up-regulation, most likely due to a
post-transcriptional
aberration,
may
contribute
to
malignancy.
Silencing of Dopamine Receptor D2 Inhibits
Cancer Cell Growth in Vitro and in Vivo
To determine whether DRD2 contributes to tumor cell
growth and survival, we suppressed DRD2 expression in
the pancreatic cancer cell lines Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2

lentiviral
delivery
of
expression
vectors
of
shRNAs targeting DRD2. Knockdown of DRD2 expression
by 2 independent shRNA constructs impaired prolifera-
tion of both cell lines as measured by a long-term colony-
formation
assay
(Figure
2A
and
Supplementary
Figure 1A).
For confirmation in vivo, we subcutaneously injected
1 � 106 Panc-1 cells expressing either of the 2 shRNAs
targeting DRD2 or the pLKO control into severe combined
immunodeficient
beige
mice,
with
2
replicates,
and
monitored tumor size over time. Mice implanted with
pLKO-expressing cells developed tumors much earlier
(21.7 ± 1.6 days) than those engrafted with DRD2-
deficient cells (33.3 ± 1.2 days with shDRD2#1 or 27.2
± 1.5 days with shDRD2#2). Mice engrafted with DRD2-
deficient cells exhibited significantly reduced tumor vol-
ume
compared
with
the
control
group
(P
<.002,
Figure 2B), while there was no significant difference in
body
weight
between
control
and
test
groups
(Supplementary Figure 1B). Immunohistochemical anal-
ysis of the tumors confirmed the reduced levels of DRD2
in tissues isolated from animals treated with DRD2-
deficient cells compared with the controls (Figure 2C
and D), in line with lower DRD2 messenger RNA levels in
tumors developed from DRD2-deficient cells as assayed
by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (Supplementary Figure 1C). Concomitant to the
reduction in DRD2, protein Ki-67—a marker of cell pro-
liferation12—was markedly reduced (Figure 2C and D).
These results demonstrated that DRD2 has a key role in
proliferation and survival of tumor cells.
Pharmacologic Blockade of Dopamine Receptor
D2 Impairs Cancer Cell Growth
We examined the effect of pharmacologic inhibition of
DRD2 on cancer cell proliferation. Different concentrations
of the DRD2 antagonist pimozide, an FDA-approved DRD2
inhibitor used for treatment of schizophrenia,13 were tested
on 5 established pancreatic cancer cell lines—Panc-1,
CFPAC-1, Capan-1, MiaPaCa-2, and BxPC-3. Treatment with
pimozide resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on
cell growth in all examined cell lines. Notably, the pimozide
effect was stronger in MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3 cells, which
showed higher expression levels of DRD2 among the cell
lines, and weaker on a primary normal fibroblast cell line
used as a control (Figure 3A). We repeated the assay with
another DRD2 inhibitor, L-741,626 (L-741).14 L-741 treat-
ment
had
virtually
the
same
effect
(Supplementary
Figure 2A). Taken together, our results demonstrated
that pharmacologic blockade of DRD2 activity inhibits
proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.
Induction of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in
Response to Dopamine Receptor D2 Blockade
Deficiency of DRD2 leads to endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
stress,15 the severe form of which has anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic effects in cancer cells.16 We examined the
possible effect of DRD2 blockade on induction of ER stress
by evaluating the level of phosphorylated PERK (Thr 981).
Pimozide increased phosphorylation of PERK in a dose-
dependent manner in both Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2 cells, as
determined by immunoblotting (Figure 3B). Similar results
were obtained by treating cells with L-741 (Supplementary
Figure 2B). As ER stress is coupled to the release of Ca2þ
from the ER into the cytosol,17 we examined whether DRD2
inhibition would affect the cytosolic abundance of Ca2þ.

 Indeed, treatment with both pimozide and L-741 increased
the concentration of cytosolic Ca2þ within seconds in Panc-1
and MiaPaCa-2 (Figure 3C), showing that DRD2 blockade
induces ER stress in PDAC cells.
Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate and Protein
Kinase A Mediates the Effects of Dopamine
Receptor D2 Inhibition on Endoplasmic
Reticulum Stress
It has been shown that cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA)
regulate Ca2þ levels in the cytosol and are involved in ER
stress.18,19 It has also been reported that DRD2 modulates
intracellular cAMP formation.20 Accordingly, we examined
whether induction of ER stress by DRD2 blockade would be
mediated by cAMP and PKA. To this end, the activity of PKA,
which is dependent on the presence of cAMP, was measu-
red through Western blot analysis using a phospho-PKA
substrate

following treatment with pimozide. Activation of PKA was
detected upon incubation with 1 mM pimozide. The effect
grew stronger with the administration of higher drug con-
centrations (Figure 3D), indicating that cAMP/PKA is acti-
vated in a dose-dependent manner upon inhibition of DRD2.
In order to examine whether the ER stress induced by
DRD2 inhibition is influenced by modulation of cAMP or
PKA, Panc-1 cells were pretreated with SQ22536, a specific
cAMP inhibitor, to down-regulate cAMP and PKA activation;

ER to cytoplasm was completely blocked or substan-
tially reduced by a pretreatment with SQ22536 or H-89,
respectively (Figure 3E). The stronger reduction of Ca2þ
levels by SQ22536 may be explained by the finding that
cAMP affects all calcium transport system receptors in the
ER, whether they are PKA-dependent or not.18 Together, our
findings showed that DRD2 antagonists increase cytosolic
levels of Ca2þ in a rapid and effective manner; the
level of cAMP, which acts downstream of DRD2,22,23 is
increased after the blockade of DRD2; and Ca2þ levels are
positively regulated by cAMP mainly and to a lesser extent
by PKA.

 D1.24,25 We therefore investigated the effect of DRD2 in-
hibition on cell cycle progression. Panc-1 and MiaPaCa-2

zide for 48 hours and their distribution in the cell cycle

We further validated the induction of cell cycle arrest at
a molecular level by measuring the abundance of cell cycle
checkpoint proteins. Consistent with the fluorescence-
activated cell sorting data, Western blot analysis showed
a decrease in the cyclin D1, p-Rb, and cyclin E1 levels, and
an increase in the levels of p21 and p27 in a dose-

Dopamine Receptor D2 Inhibition Activates
Unfolded Protein Response in Pancreatic
Cancer Cells
As reported here, the blockade of DRD2 led to phos-
phorylation and thus activation of PERK, which is a
marker
of
unfolded
protein
response
(UPR).
Recent
studies have shown that a strong induction of UPR as
indicated by PERK activation can lead to UPR-induced
apoptosis through phosphorylation of downstream mole-
cule eIF2a and selective induction of ATF4, which in turn
increases
the
expression
of
CHOP.26
Therefore,
we
examined the activity and expression levels of proteins
involved in the PERK arm of UPR after treatment of cells
with pimozide (Figure 4C). Phosphorylation of eIF2a as
well as the expression levels of ATF4 and CHOP increased
upon pimozide treatment in a dose-dependent manner, in
line with the increase in activated PERK (Figure 3B). We
further investigated the induction of UPR in DRD2-
deficient cells in vivo. In severe combined immunodefi-
cient beige mice, the abundance of phosphorylated eIF2a
(p-eIF2a) and CHOP was assessed in tumors that devel-
oped after implantation of Panc-1 cells infected with
shDRD2 constructs or the pLKO control. Immunohisto-
chemical analysis on tumor samples demonstrated the
elevated levels of p-eIF2a and CHOP in tumors developed
from DRD2-deficient cells as compared with the control
tumors (Figure 4D). These findings provide evidence that
inhibition of DRD2 triggers UPR. To investigate the extent
to which activation of ER-UPR signaling mediates growth
inhibitory function of DRD2 blockade, we generated
ATF4-deficient sublines of Panc-1 and MiaPaca-2 cells
through stable knock-down using 2 specific ATF4-shRNAs
(Supplementary Figure 3A and B), and examined effects of
DRD2 inhibition in these models. Likewise, we tested ef-
fects of the ER stress inducer, thapsigargin,27 on cell
viability and apoptosis in these cells. Reduction of cell
viability and induction of apoptosis after treatment with
pimozide or thapsigargin were significantly declined in
ATF4-deficient
cells
compared
with
control
(pLKO)
(Figure 4E and F). Similar results were obtained after
treatment of
these cells with L-741 (Supplementary
Figure 3C�F). These results show that the UPR pathway
is an important mediator of growth inhibitory effects of
DRD2 blockade.
Blockade of Dopamine Receptor D2 Inhibits
Cancer Cell Migration
Our previous results showed that DRD2 regulates the
cAMP level, which is known to modulate cell adhesion and
motility in pancreatic cancer cells.10 Consequently, we
studied whether DRD2 inhibition has an effect on cancer
cell migration by assessing the motility of the highly
invasive Panc-1 cells in a wound healing assay in the
presence of the DRD2 antagonists pimozide and L-741.

we validated the inhibitory effect of pimozide and L-741
on pancreatic cancer cell migration by testing another cell
line (MiaPaCa-2) (Figure 5C). In order to verify the
involvement of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the observed
inhibitory effect of DRD2 blockade, we analyzed cell
migration while perturbing this pathway. The reduction in
cell migration upon treatment with pimozide or L-741
was rescued by the addition of H89 or SQ22536, which
both reduce PKA activation and cAMP levels (Figure 5D,
and Supplementary Figure 4D). Taken together, these
results demonstrated that the DRD2 blockade suppresses
pancreatic cancer cell migration by induction of cAMP and
activation of PKA.

(10 mg/kg selected based on results reported for glioblas-

no significant effect on animal weight (Figure 6F).

 network-based approaches to PDAC transcriptome profiles.
Specifically, we leveraged on identifying aberration hubs
by overlaying PDAC-associated gene expression patterns
on the human protein interaction network in order to
highlight factors with potential driver activities among the
plethora of deregulated genes. This led to the identification
of DRD2, which we validated as a novel promising thera-
peutic target. Our findings revealed a high expression of
DRD2 in PDAC, and confirmed the efficacy of its blockade
to suppress cancer cell proliferation, survival, and metas-
tasis potential.
We found that DRD2 blockade has an anti-proliferative
effect in pancreatic cancers, while activating ER stress, in
line with previous studies reporting that the deficiency of
DRD2 induces ER stress.15 The accelerated proliferation of
cancer cells in solid tumors often leads to nutrient depri-
vation in their microenvironment and results in protein
misfolding, which eventually triggers activation of ER
stress.16 Whereas moderate ER stress supports cell survival
in nutrient-deprived conditions, excessive ER stress leads to
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,30,31 and has emerged as an
attractive anti-cancer therapeutic avenue.32,33 As such,
inhibiting DRD2 provides a targeted approach to activate ER
stress in cancer cells.
Importantly, when compared with normal samples,
DRD2 expression was elevated significantly in CP, which is
a known major risk factor for PDAC,11 suggesting that DRD2
overexpression may be involved in the early steps of PDAC
development. In line with this observation, Sachlos and
colleagues34 have shown that dopamine receptors are
overexpressed in human cancer stem cells and that inhibi-
tion of dopamine receptor signaling can serve as an effec-
tive approach to impair tumorigenicity of cancer stem cells.
Notably, both studies utilized DRD2 antagonists that are
approved by the FDA as antipsychotic agents (pimozide and
haloperidol
in
our
study
and
thriodazine
in
Sachlos
et al). Interestingly, schizophrenic patients receiving DRD2
antagonists have a reduced incidence rate of different solid
tumors, including those of rectum, colon, and prostate,
compared with the general population.35 Likewise, lower
cancer incidence rates have been reported in patients
suffering from Parkinson’s disease in which the dopami-
nergic pathway is deficient.36 These findings suggest that
dopaminergic signaling may be involved in the development
of multiple cancers, and may potentially serve as a pan-
cancer therapeutic target. Supporting this, DRD2 antago-
nists have also shown anti-cancer effects in leukemia34 and
glioblastoma.29 However, other effectors including signal
transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular
signal�regulated kinase signaling have been proposed as
mediators of DRD2 function in these tumors. Notably, we
did not observe a decrease in phosphorylation of signal
transducer and activator of transcription 5 or extracellular
signal�regulated kinase in PDAC cells upon treatment with
DRD2 antagonists (Supplementary Figure 5), but validated
that the anti-growth effect of pimozide and haloperidol on
pancreatic cancer cells is primarily through targeting
DRD2
(Supplementary
Figure
6).
Given
the
inherent
heterogeneous nature of cancer and the involvement of
GPCRs in multiple signaling cascades,8 it is possible that
the
functional
consequences
of
DRD2
blockade
are
mediated through various signaling pathways in different
tumors. Additional experiments are warranted to elucidate
the exact mechanism of DRD2 inhibition in pancreatic
cancer.
Our study highlights the potential of DRD2 antagonism
as a possible therapeutic approach in pancreatic cancer,
which could be facilitated through a drug-repositioning
strategy, as previously practiced for pimozide in treatment
of metastatic melanoma.37 This also motivates future
studies
to
investigate
possible
relationships
between
DRD2 levels and different PDAC subtypes, emerged by
transciptome38
and
metabolite
profiling,39
which
may
lead to a better understanding of DRD2 function in
PDAC, and help with tailoring therapy for individual
patients.
