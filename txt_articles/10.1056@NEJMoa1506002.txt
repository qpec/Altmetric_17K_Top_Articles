BACKGROUND
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the leading cause of later illness and death 
after allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. We hypothesized that the inclu-
sion of antihuman T-lymphocyte immune globulin (ATG) in a myeloablative conditioning 
regimen for patients with acute leukemia would result in a significant reduction in 
chronic GVHD 2 years after allogeneic peripheral-blood stem-cell transplantation from an 
HLA-identical sibling.
METHODS
We conducted a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized phase 3 study of ATG as 
part of a conditioning regimen. A total of 168 patients were enrolled at 27 centers. Patients 
were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ATG or not receive ATG, with stratification 
according to center and risk of disease.
RESULTS
After a median follow-up of 24 months, the cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 
32.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to 46.7) in the ATG group and 68.7% (95% CI, 
58.4 to 80.7) in the non-ATG group (P<0.001). The rate of 2-year relapse-free survival was 
similar in the ATG group and the non-ATG group (59.4% [95% CI, 47.8 to 69.2] and 64.6% 
[95% CI, 50.9 to 75.3], respectively; P 
= 
0.21), as was the rate of overall survival (74.1% [95% 
CI, 62.7 to 82.5] and 77.9% [95% CI, 66.1 to 86.1], respectively; P 
= 
0.46). There were no 
significant between-group differences in the rates of relapse, infectious complications, 
acute GVHD, or adverse events. The rate of a composite end point of chronic GVHD–free 
and relapse-free survival at 2 years was significantly higher in the ATG group than in the 
non-ATG group (36.6% vs. 16.8%, P 
= 
0.005).
CONCLUSIONS
The inclusion of ATG resulted in a significantly lower rate of chronic GVHD after alloge-
neic transplantation than the rate without ATG. The survival rate was similar in the two 
groups, but the rate of a composite end point of chronic GVHD–free survival and relapse-
free survival was higher with ATG. (Funded by the Neovii Biotech and the European Soci-

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
C
hronic graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD) is a major complication of allo-
geneic stem-cell transplantation that re-
sults in later illness and death and a reduction in 
quality of life.1,2 Risk factors for chronic GVHD 
are the use of peripheral blood as a source of 
stem cells, a history of acute GVHD, and the 
use of donated stem cells with high numbers of 
T cells.3-7 In a meta-analysis, the Stem Cell Trial-
ists’ Collaborative Group reported an incidence 
of extensive chronic GVHD of 47% after periph-
eral-blood stem-cell transplantation from an 
HLA-identical sibling.4 In 2012, more than 70% 
of the stem-cell transplantations performed in 
Europe used peripheral blood as a source of 
stem cells.6 Although the prevention of acute 
GVHD has improved in the past two decades, no 
major improvement has been made in the pre-
vention of chronic GVHD, and randomized stud-
ies of therapies aimed at reducing the incidence 
of chronic GVHD have not been able to achieve 
their goal.8,9 Only antihuman T-lymphocyte im-
mune globulin (ATG) has been shown to lower 
the incidence of chronic GVHD after stem-cell 
transplantation from an unrelated donor10,11 
and, in smaller, retrospective studies, after HLA-
identical transplantation.12,13 Here we report the 
results of a trial that was designed to study 
whether including ATG in the myeloablative con-
ditioning regimen would reduce the risk of chron-
ic GVHD among patients in complete remission 
from acute leukemia who received peripheral-
blood stem cells from an HLA-identical sibling.
Methods
Study Design
In this prospective, multicenter, open-label, phase 3 
study, patients were randomly assigned to re-
ceive ATG or not receive ATG as part of a myelo-
ablative conditioning regimen. The regimen con-
sisted of cyclophosphamide (120 mg per kilogram 
of body weight) and total body irradiation (12 Gy) 
or busulfan (16 mg per kilogram orally or 12.8 mg 
per kilogram intravenously), with or without 
etoposide (30 to 60 mg per kilogram), as well as 
ATG at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram for those 
randomly assigned to the ATG group, on 3, 2, and 
1 days before a transplantation of allogeneic 
peripheral-blood stem cells from an HLA-identi-
cal donor. (For more information on patient dis-
position see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.) All siblings were matched serologi-
cally for HLA-A and HLA-B and by high-resolution 
DNA matching for HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQB1 
alleles. Patients were eligible for study participa-
tion if they were 18 to 65 years of age, had acute 
myeloid or lymphoblastic leukemia that was in 
its first or subsequent complete remission, and 
had an indication for an allogeneic hematopoi-
etic stem-cell transplantation. Other major crite-
ria for inclusion were adequate function of the 
major organ systems (hepatic, renal [creatinine 
clearance of more than 30 ml per minute], pul-
monary [diffusing capacity of the lung for car-
bon monoxide of more than 35%], and cardiac 
[left ejection fraction of at least 30%]) and the 
use of stem cells from peripheral blood as the 
graft source. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of 
the administration of cyclosporine and a short 
course of methotrexate (15 mg per square meter 
of body-surface area on day 1 after transplanta-
tion and 10 mg per square meter on days 3, 6, 
and 11 after transplantation).
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio, 
with stratification according to center and dis-
ease risk. The randomization code was generated 
by nQuery Advisor, version 6.0, with the use of a 
permuted, block-randomization plan and a block 
size of 4. Investigators were unaware of the 
group assignments until the end of the clinical 
part of the trial. Each participating center re-
ceived only complete random blocks.
Study End Points
The primary end point of the study was the cu-
mulative incidence of chronic GVHD at 2 years 
as determined according to the revised Seattle 
criteria and the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH) criteria.14,15 Secondary end points included 
the incidences of engraftment, acute GVHD, 
nonrelapse-related death, relapse-free and over-
all survival at 2 years, and a composite end point 
of chronic GVHD–free and relapse-free survival 
at 2 years. Acute GVHD was diagnosed accord-
ing to Glucksberg’s criteria,16 and chronic GVHD 
according to the modified Seattle criteria (for 
categorization of chronic GVHD as clinical lim-
ited or clinical extensive)14 (see Tables S2 and S3, 
respectively, in the Supplementary Appendix) 
and according to the NIH criteria for global 
chronic GVHD scoring (mild, moderate, or severe) 
and organ involvement (scored as 0, 1, 2 or 3,

with higher scores indicating greater involve-
ment).15 Toxicity in both groups was graded 
according to the Bearman score.17 The study 
started recruitment in October 2006. At the 
time, there was confusion among European in-
vestigators regarding the need to register the 
trial before initiation of enrollment; the trial 
was registered in May 2008.
Study Oversight
The study was conducted in accordance with 
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the provi-
sions of the Declaration of Helsinki. An inde-
pendent ethics committee at each study site ap-
proved the protocol (available at NEJM.org). All 
patients provided written informed consent. The 
study was sponsored by the University Medical 
Center Hamburg–Eppendorf and was conducted 
in collaboration with the Chronic Malignancies 
Working Party of the European Group for Blood 
and Marrow Transplantation. The first, second, 
and last authors designed the study, and Phar-
malog (Munich) gathered the data with the use 
of an electronic case-report form. The third 
from last author analyzed the data, and that 
author and the first author vouch for the data 
and analysis and adherence to the study proto-
col. The first author wrote the first draft, and all 
the coauthors made the decision to submit the 
manuscript for publication. No one who is not 
an author contributed to the writing of the 
manuscript. ATG (ATG-Fresenius) was supplied 
by Neovii Biotech, which also provided addi-
tional financial support but did not contribute to 
the analysis or approve the manuscript for pub-
lication.
Statistical Analysis
We used cumulative incidence analysis to assess 
chronic GVHD–free survival and relapse-free sur-
vival and labeled death before the event of inter-
est as a competing risk.18,19 Death from relapse 
was used as a competing risk for the cumulative 
incidence analysis of death without relapse. Over-
all survival was assessed with the use of Kaplan–
Meier analysis. Further treatment-group compari-
sons were performed with the use of chi-square 
tests for nominal data, Mann–Whitney U-tests 
for ordinal data, and analyses of variance for 
interval or ratio-scale data. Exploratory, post 
hoc, Cox multiple regression analysis was used 
for subgroup analyses and for the purpose of 
determining the effect on the incidence of 
chronic GVHD and on overall survival of recipi-
ent age, first versus second remission, acute 
lymphoblastic versus acute myeloid leukemia, 
cytogenetic risk, risk of underlying disease, dif-
ference between the sex of the donor and the sex 
of the recipient, cytomegalovirus positivity in 
the recipient, type of conditioning, CD34+ cells 
transplanted, grade of acute GVHD and chronic 
GVHD (time dependent [i.e., the corresponding 
event can occur at different points in time after 
transplantation]) in addition to treatment as-
signment (ATG vs. non-ATG). Confidence inter-
vals for the differences in risk according to 
treatment group were determined with the use 
of Wilson’s method.20
The sample size was calculated on the basis 
of expected 2-year rates of chronic GVHD of 
25% in the ATG group and 55% in the non-ATG 
group. We estimated that a sample size of 160 
patients (80 patients in each group) would give 
the study at least 90% power to reject the null 
hypothesis in a log-rank test model. All patients 
who received at least one dose of the condition-
ing regimen were evaluated for efficacy and 
safety. Confirmatory testing of the prespecified 
primary outcome measure, 2-year cumulative 
incidence of chronic GVHD, was performed in 
the full analysis set at a type I error level of 0.5 
(two-sided). All other P values are considered 
descriptively (including those that are not sig-
nificant).
Cumulative incidence analyses were performed 
with the use of NCSS statistical software, ver-
sion 9, and R statistical software, version 2.10.1 
(cmprsk package).21,22 IBM SPSS Statistics soft-
ware, version 22.0, was used for all other analyses.
Results
Patient Characteristics
From December 2006 through February 2012, a 
total of 168 patients were enrolled at 27 centers; 
7 patients were excluded before randomization 
because they did not meet the inclusion criteria. 
Of the 161 patients who underwent randomiza-
tion, 6 were excluded from the analysis because 
the donor withdrew (2 patients) or progressive 
disease developed (4 patients). The baseline char-
acteristics of the remaining 155 patients are 
shown in Table 1. The two groups were well bal-
anced with respect to the Disease Risk Index for

disease status and cytogenetic risk; the number 
of infused CD34+ cells; and other variables. The 
only baseline characteristic that differed be-

was higher in the non-ATG group than the ATG 
group (43.5 years vs. 39.0 years, P 
=

median dose of cyclosporine at the time of 
transplantation and at day 100 was 3 mg per 
kilogram and did not differ significantly be-
tween groups (P

Antilymphocyte Globulin and Chronic GVHD
Graft Failure and Engraftment
No graft failure occurred in the ATG group, and 
one failure occurred in the non-ATG group 
(1.4% of the patients). The median times to leu-
kocyte engraftment (absolute neutrophil count, 
≥0.5×109 per liter) and platelet engraftment 
(platelet count, ≥20×109 per liter) were signifi-
cantly longer in the ATG group than in the non-
ATG group: 18 days (range, 10 to 31) versus 15 
days (range, 11 to 34) (P<0.001) and 20 days 
(range, 10 to 110) versus 13 days (range, 6 to 29), 
respectively (P<0.001) (Table 2).
Acute and Chronic GVHD
The rate of acute GVHD of grade 2, 3, or 4 was 
10.8% in the ATG group and 18.1% in the non-
ATG group (P 
= 
0.13), and the rate of acute 
GVHD of grade 3 or 4 was 2.4% in the ATG 
group and 8.3% in the non-ATG group (P 
= 
0.10) 
Table 2). The median time to the onset of chron-
ic GVHD was 164 days after transplantation in 
both groups. The cumulative incidence of chron-
ic GVHD at 2 years was 32.2% in the ATG group 
(95% confidence interval [CI], 22.1 to 46.7) and 
68.7% in the non-ATG group (95% CI, 58.4 to 
80.7) (P<0.001) (Fig. 1). The cumulative inci-
dence of minimal or modest chronic GVHD at 
2 years, classified as clinical limited chronic 
GVHD according to the revised Seattle criteria 
(see Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix), 
was 28.1% (95% CI, 18.3 to 43.2) in the ATG 
group and 53.3% (95% CI, 40.6 to 70.1) in the 
non-ATG group (P 
= 
0.005; see Fig. S2 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The corresponding 
cumulative incidence of clinical extensive chron-
ic GVHD was 7.6% (95% CI, 3.0 to 19.6) and 
52.4% (95% CI, 39.3 to 69.9) (P<0.001) (Fig. 2A).
The NIH scores for global and organ-specific 
chronic GVHD were significantly lower in the 
ATG group than in the non-ATG group (P<0.001); 
chronic GVHD was classified as mild in 15.6% 
of the patients in the ATG group versus 16.7% in 
the non-ATG group, moderate in 8.4% versus 
25.0%, and severe in 2.4% versus 22.2% (Table 2). 
According to NIH scores, in all organs except 
genital organs, there was less chronic GVHD 
involvement of grade 2 or higher in the ATG 
group than in the non-ATG group, with signifi-
cantly less involvement of the skin, the mouth, 
and the eyes (Table 3). A subgroup analysis of 
chronic GVHD shows the effect of ATG in sub-
groups of the full analysis cohort (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
In multivariate analyses, the use of ATG did 
not result in a significantly greater rate of re-
lapse than the rate without ATG (hazard ratio, 
1.03; 95% CI, 0.57 to 1.88; P 
= 
0.91), but the non-
significant difference in relapse does not justify 
the conclusion of equivalence. The factors that 
were associated with the development of chronic 
GVHD included the presence of previous acute 
GVHD (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.29 to 2.05; 
P<0.001), the combination of female donor and 
male recipient (hazard ratio, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.11 
to 3.65; P 
= 
0.02), and the use of ATG (hazard 
ratio, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.65; P 
= 
0.001) (Table 
S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
At 1 year, 91% of the patients in the ATG 
group who could be evaluated had discontinued 
cyclosporine, but only 39% in the non-ATG group 
had done so. Complete resolution of GVHD or 
the absence of chronic GVHD was reported for 
83% of patients in the ATG group versus 63% of 
patients in the non-ATG group at 6 months, 77% 
versus 44% at 12 months, and 75% versus 40% 
at 24 months. Ongoing chronic GVHD was noted 
in 17% of the patients in the ATG group and in 
36% of those in the non-ATG group at 6 months, 
in 23% and 36%, respectively, at 12 months, and 
in 25% and 60%, respectively, at 24 months.
Toxicity, Nonrelapse-Related Mortality,  
and Relapse
Infectious complications were observed in 57.8% 
of patients in the ATG group and in 54.2% of 
patients in the non-ATG group (P 
= 
0.65). No 
post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder 
was observed during follow-up. The rate of cyto-
megalovirus reactivation was not significantly 
higher in the ATG group than in the non-ATG 
group (21.7% and 25.0%, respectively), nor was 
the rate of Epstein–Barr virus reactivation (3.6% 
and 1.4%, respectively) or fungal infection (3.6% 
and 4.2%, respectively) (Table 2). The rate of 
nonrelapse-related death at 2 years was 14.0% 
(95% CI, 8.0 to 24.1) in the ATG group and 
12.0% (95% CI, 6.1 to 22.4) in the non-ATG 
group (P 
= 
0.60) (Fig. 2B). Toxic effects to organs 
as measured by means of Bearman’s score did 
not differ significantly between groups with the 
exception of gastrointestinal toxic effects, for 
which the rate was significantly lower in the 
ATG group than in the non-ATG group (28.9%

Antilymphocyte Globulin and Chronic GVHD
group differences in severe or other adverse 
events related to study drug were found (Table 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). The cumu-
lative incidence of relapse at 2 years was 32.2% 
(95% CI, 23.4 to 44.2) in the ATG group and 
25.5% (95% CI, 16.3 to 44.2) in the non-ATG 
group (P 
= 
0.17) (Fig. 2C).
Survival
The 2-year rate of relapse-free survival was 
59.4% (95% CI, 47.8 to 69.2) in the ATG group 
and 64.6% (95% CI, 50.9 to 75.3) in the non-ATG 
group (P 
= 
0.21), and the 2-year rate of overall 
survival was 74.1% (95% CI, 62.7 to 82.5) and 
77.9% (95% CI, 66.1 to 86.1), respectively 
(P 
= 
0.46) (Fig. 2D and 2E). In a multivariate 
analysis, only the diagnosis of acute lymphoblas-
tic leukemia versus acute myeloid leukemia in-
fluenced survival (hazard ratio, 2.64; 95% CI, 
1.18 to 5.89; P 
= 
0.02), whereas the hazard ratio 
for survival with ATG versus non-ATG was 0.74 
(95% CI, 0.34 to 1.65; P 
= 
0.47) (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The rate of the com-
posite end point of 2-year survival free from 
chronic GVHD and free from relapse was 36.6% 
(95% CI, 25.2 to 48.0) in the ATG group and 
16.8% (95% CI, 9.2 to 26.4) in the non-ATG 
group (P 
= 
0.005) (Fig. 2F).
Discussion
Chronic GVHD is the leading cause of late ill-
ness and death after allogeneic hematopoietic 
stem-cell transplantation.1,2 One of the risk fac-
tors for the development of chronic GVHD after 
allogeneic stem-cell transplantation is the use of 
peripheral-blood stem cells as a graft source,4 a 
factor that may have contributed to the increased 
incidence of chronic GVHD recently observed by 
Arai et al.,3 since T-cell levels in grafts are 
higher than those in the marrow. In our study, 
the incidence of chronic GVHD at 2 years was 
36.5 percentage points lower when ATG was 
added to the conditioning regimen than when it 
was not added; the rate of relapse was not sig-
nificantly higher with ATG, but the nonsignifi-
cant difference in relapse rates does not justify 
the conclusion of equivalence.
More important, the between-group differ-
ence in the rate of chronic GVHD was seen 
mainly in patients with the clinical extensive 
form of chronic GVHD, with a rate that was 44.8 
percentage points lower in the ATG group than 
in the non-ATG group (7.6% vs. 52.4%), and a 
lower rate of chronic GVHD involvement was 
observed in nearly all patients. Within 1 year 
after transplantation, 91% of patients in the 
ATG group but only 39% of those in the non-
ATG group had discontinued immunosuppres-
sive medication with cyclosporine. The major 
source of concern associated with any T-cell de-
pletion is the higher risk of relapse that results 
from the loss of graft-versus-leukemia effects, a 
result that has been observed in several studies 
in which in vivo and ex vivo T-cell–depleted 
grafts were used.24 After a follow-up of 2 years, 
we did not observe a significantly higher rate of 
relapse in the ATG group than in the non-ATG 
group, with the result that the rates of relapse-
free and overall survival were similar in the two 
groups. Even if a modest increase in the rate of 
relapse in the ATG group cannot be ruled out, 
the significantly lower incidence of chronic 
GVHD with ATG resulted in a significantly 
higher rate of 2-year survival free from chronic 
GVHD among patients who received ATG than

Antilymphocyte Globulin and Chronic GVHD
among those who did not receive ATG (50% vs. 
23%). Because the patients in the ATG group 
were aware of group assignment, the possibility 
of a certain bias in the grading of chronic GVHD 
cannot be excluded. The most frequent cause of 
treatment failure after transplantation is relapse, 
which in patients with acute leukemia occurs 
predominantly in the first or second year after 
transplantation.25 In the current study, the rate 
of the composite end point of 2-year survival free 
from chronic GVHD and free from relapse was 
significantly higher among those who received 
ATG than among those who did not (37% vs. 17%).
Chronic GVHD is the second leading cause of 
death among patients who survive for 2 years 
after transplantation; extending the follow-up 
period for these patients would confirm its ef-
fect on long-term survival.1 Unfortunately, our 
study was terminated at 2 years, and longer-term 
follow-up data for the patients who participated 
in this study are not available. We did not ob-
serve a higher rate of infectious complications 
after ATG, as has been reported after the im-
plementation of other T-cell depletion tech-
niques.10,11,26
Although some progress has been made in 
preventing acute GVHD, most attempts to re-
duce the risk of chronic GVHD have been unsuc-
cessful.27-29 A reduction in the rate of severe acute 
GVHD and in the rate of chronic GVHD has 
been observed with ATG only in the case of 
matched or mismatched, unrelated allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.10,11 How-
ever, neither of these studies used chronic 
GVHD as the primary end point.
More recently, post-transplantation cyclophos-
phamide has been shown in a prospective study 
to reduce the risk of both acute and chronic 
GVHD, even after haploidentical stem-cell trans-
plantation, but data from prospective random-
ized studies are lacking.30 Other T-cell–depleting 
strategies (e.g., treatment with alemtuzumab, an 
anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody, or ex vivo CD34 
selection) have been pursued, and low rates of 
GVHD have been reported. Although such T-cell–
depleting strategies resulted in a higher risk of 
relapse among patients with chronic myeloid 
leukemia, this increased risk does not seem to 
apply to patients with acute leukemia31,32; how-
ever, concern about an increased risk of relapse 
associated with the use of T-cell depletion re-
mains.
The ATG preparation used in our study is a 
polyclonal antihuman T-lymphocyte immune 
globulin derived from rabbits after immunization 
with the Jurkat human T-cell line. This highly 
purified immune globulin consists of antibodies 
exhibiting a direct effect on T cells through op-
sonization and lysis after complement activation. 
Because antigens such as CD19 or CD138 are 
also targeted by ATG, antitumor effects have 
been observed in B-cell cancers and to a lesser

sive Chronic GVHD, Relapse, Relapse-free and Overall

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) criteria for organ involvement, which rates the extent and severity 
of chronic GVHD for each organ or site and takes organ function into account, the maximum involvement of the organs 
listed was ≥2 on a scale of 0 to 3, with 0 indicating no disease, 1 mild disease, 2 moderate disease, and 3 severe disease.

extent in myeloid cancers.33 Taking into account 
the effect of donor T cells and B cells on the 
development of chronic GVHD,34-36 the effect of 
ATG on antigen-presenting cells such as B cells 
and dendritic cells37 and the induction of regula-
tory T cells38 may have contributed to the sig-
nificant reduction in chronic GVHD. Other ATGs 
derived from rabbits or horses have also been 
used, but because of their different immuno-
logic properties and the lack of reliable com-
parative studies, the different brands and doses 
are not interchangeable and the results may not 
be generalizable to other ATGs.
In summary, our study shows that incorpora-
tion of ATG in the myeloablative conditioning 
regimen before transplantation of peripheral-
blood stem cells from HLA-identical siblings 
resulted in a significantly lower rate of chronic 
GVHD than the rate without ATG. The rates of 
relapse-free and overall survival were similar in 
the two groups, but the rate of a composite end 
point of survival free from chronic GVHD and 
survival free from relapse was significantly higher 
with ATG.
