Abstract
Academic misconduct/dishonesty has become widespread behavior among many univer-
sity students across the globe, and medical education is not an exception. Until recently, few
efforts have been made to study the dishonest behavior in Middle-Eastern universities. This
study examined the prevalence and predisposing factors of cheating among medical stu-
dents in Saudi Arabia and suggests suitable preventive measures. A cross-sectional sur-
vey-based study was conducted at a government medical college during the 2014–2015
academic year. The response rate was 58.5% (421/720). The overall cheating behavior
practiced by the participants was 29%, predominantly by male students. High GPA scoring
students were the least likely to cheat. The participants living with their families were more
likely to cheat compared to those who were living apart from their families. The reasons par-
ticipants gave to justify their cheating behavior included getting better grades, passing the
course, and lacking preparation while still recognizing that cheating is a ‘mistake.’ Overall,
significant academic misconduct concerning cheating was found among the Saudi medical
students; this misconduct is alarming in a reputable government institution. The implemen-
tation of strict punishments, requiring ethical courses and creating ethical awareness by
exploiting the potential of Islamic religious belief might help to control this problem.
Introduction
Academic fraud, academic misconduct, or academic dishonesty. All these terms hold similar
meanings and have become widespread behavior, especially in the form of plagiarism, lying,
and cheating, among university students in almost all subject areas, and medical science edu-
cation is not an exception, regardless of the implementation of various preventative strategies
[1,2,3]. Such improper behavior severely affects the knowledge of future doctors and therefore
the quality of healthcare [4].

 Earlier studies reported a high prevalence of dishonest behavior in medical schools globally
[5,6,7]. Fraudulent or dishonest academic conduct was found to be prevalent among half
(approximately 56%) of the medical students according to a Canadian study [8]. A study from
the United Kingdom reported that dishonest conduct is prevalent among pharmacy students,
and male students are more likely to confess to academic dishonesty as opposed to their female
counterparts [9]. Cheating, which is a major form of academic misconduct, was also prevalent
among students at Harvard University [3]. A North American study by McCabe (2005)
reported that the prevalence of cheating and dishonesty was approximately 33% [1]. Students
who passed an exam confessed that they received some pertinent information about the exam
in advance. The study by McCabe (2005) also reported that most of the cheating was on writ-
ten assignments [1]. In an Iranian study, Mortaz Hejri et al. (2013) reported that cheating and
helping others to cheat are higher during internships in the final training year compared to
clerkships in the 4th and 5th years [10]. A study from Croatia reported that cheating is prevalent
among medical students, and signing attendance on behalf of other students is the most fre-
quent kind of academic misconduct. Additionally, it is the only type of cheating, and most of
the students agreed and considered it a normal behavior [5]. The persistence of cheating
behavior among students has been found to be the same both before (in previous classes, e.g.,
pre-university and high school) and after enrollment at the university (i.e., in medical college)
[11]. Earlier studies have also found that male students are significantly more involved in aca-
demic misconduct than female students [12,13,14]. In contrast, Rennie and Rudland (2003)
reported no difference between the attitude and behavior of male and female students toward
academic misconduct [15]. Unfortunately, what is alarming about this cheating behavior is
that it is acceptable among medical students [7,11].
A decade ago, Hrabak et al. (2004) identified various social and cultural factors that contrib-
ute to academic misconduct among different communities of students [5]. In two different
studies, a heavy academic load was found to be the most common factor contributing to cheat-
ing [3,16]. Other factors identified for cheating and related to individual students are laziness,
poor grades, pressure to get the work done, and irresponsibility [3]. These factors usually lead
to unwanted consequences that affect the appropriate learning methods [3]. A study con-
ducted at a dental school revealed that a high percentage of students confessed to cheating
because of the academic pressure [4]. A study that reviewed the data pertaining to cheating in
academic institutions over the course of a decade reported that peer pressure has a significant
connection to cheating [17]. Additionally, advanced technologies used in medical education
have been found to contribute to cheating behavior among medical students [18].
Previously, published studies from different areas of the world identified various forms of
cheating and misconduct prevalent among university students [1,4,12,13,19,20]. However, for
some students, the act of cheating is copying answers from their colleagues’ answer sheet dur-
ing an examination. Forging a faculty member’s signature was found to be the most common
cheating behavior in Jordan and India [5,19,20] while copying during an examination the
most common way of cheating in medical school in the USA [3].
Students have different motivations to cheat. A study showed that students cheat to get bet-
ter grades, to appear academically proficient or intelligent in front of their family members
and friends, or to pass the course [20]. Some students justified their cheating with attitudinal
and situational factors [4]. However, the overwhelming majority of the students never justified
cheating [19].
It is clear that requiring a ‘course on ethics’ during medical school is not an effective means
to prevent cheating [4]. The majority of students who observed cheating behavior did not
report it to their faculty members, possibly because of the friendship that they had with the
cheater(s) or because of the fear that their identities would be revealed [4,21].

 To control the prevalence of cheating, various strategies have been suggested and imple-
mented across the globe. Additionally, numerous studies have investigated the possible pun-
ishment options that can minimize cheating. Warnings and student counseling of the most
preferred and accessible methods of controlling the prevalence of cheating for the teachers
[20], but until now no acceptable progress has been reported. Therefore, the faculty members
prefer more severe penalties for students involved in cheating [17,22]. The faculty members
are aware of the prevalence of different types of cheating strategies, but they fail to confront it
due to lack of evidence [1]. Remarkably, students’ awareness of academic integrity policies and
signing an ‘Honor Codes’ document is believed to lower the occurrence of cheating among
medical students [4,23].
There is a lack of research on academic misconduct (especially related to cheating behavior)
in medical schools, and only scant reports are available from the universities of Middle Eastern
countries. Additionally, there are currently no local or regional studies available that discuss
the sensitive issue of cheating among medical students. Thus, no strict rules or punishment
options have been suggested or implemented as a preventive measure for cheating. The socio-
cultural background, religious belief, ethical values and attitude of the people living in the Mid-
dle East (especially Saudi Arabia) are different than that of people living elsewhere. Therefore,
there is no guarantee that similar rules or punishments will work in this region. Considering
the facts mentioned above about the various types of academic misconduct, the present study
was conducted at a government medical college in Saudi Arabia to determine the prevalence
and predisposing factors responsible for cheating among students and suggests ways to pre-
vent this academic misconduct.
Methods
Context, participants, study design, and data collection
A cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire-based study was conducted at a govern-
mental medical college in Saudi Arabia during the 2014–2015 academic session (Supporting
Information: S1 Appendix). The study population included medical students (age group 22–
26) of the fourth, fifth, and final academic and internship years. To collect the data, a validated
scenario-based questionnaire was adapted from a previously published study [6]. The ques-
tionnaire had three sections: student’s demographic information, student’s behavior, and stu-
dent’s attitude. The first section consisted of questions related to personal data and social
background, including the participants’ academic achievement levels in the form of their
grade point average (GPA). The second section was comprised of multiple scenarios in the
English language, and for each scenario, there were two questions to answer (1. Is the student
wrong? Yes/No; 2. Have you done or considered doing the same? Yes/No). All the scenarios
were related to academic misconduct in the form of plagiarism, lying, and cheating. The sce-
narios tested whether the student agrees or disagrees with the behavior, or if he/she would con-
sider doing the same in the future. Likewise, in the third section, multiple choice questions
were posed for the students to justify their behavior(s) if they confessed to cheating during
their academic years. Some blank spaces were provided to add other justifications or sugges-
tions for the prevention of such problematic behavior(s). The survey questionnaire was distrib-
uted to the medical students and interns by sending messages to their emails and mobile
phones via WhatsApp (social media). The email and WhatsApp messages were specific to each
student and intern and were sent separately. Two reminders after one week and two weeks
were sent to the non-responsive participants following the non-compliance.

 Statistical analysis
The survey questionnaire was collected and reviewed, and the data were extrapolated and tab-
ulated for the analysis. All the statistical analyses involved in the present study were performed
using the SPSS Version 21 software program [24]. Descriptive statistics were employed to mea-
sure the percentages/frequencies, and a regression analysis test was used to evaluate the associ-
ation between different variables under consideration. During the analysis, the statistical
significance level was p-value <0.05.
Ethical approval
This study was approved by the Ethical Review Committee of the participating university med-
ical college in Saudi Arabia. Written consent was provided to all the participants, and the par-
ticipation in the study was voluntary. The purpose of the study was explained to each
participant, and the confidentiality and anonymity of each participant were maintained by
assigning a code number.
Results
The total number of respondents in our study was 421 out of 720, with a response rate of
58.5%. Of 421 respondents, 129 (30.6%) participants were from the fourth year, 152 (36%)
were from the fifth year, and 140 (33.2%) were from the internship year.
The summary of the personal data and the social background of the participants is given in
Table 1. The majority of the participants were from an urban background (386/421; 91.7%),
while only 8.3% (35/421) were from rural areas. The GPA score of 88.5% of the respondents
was 3.75 or higher; 43.5% (183) had scores of 4.5–5, and 45.1% (190) had scores of 3.75–4.49.
The number of participants that attended governmental high schools was almost equal to the
number of participants who attended private high schools. Most of the participants’ fathers
were either post-graduates (47.7%) or graduates (32.8%), while the participants’ mothers were
either graduates (38.7%) or completed primary or secondary education (30.6%). Most of the
participants (91.4%) were living with their family members. Most of the participants (96.9%)
stated that they joined the medical field by choice, and after beginning study, most of them
showed continued interest in medicine (91.2%).
Of 421 participants, approximately 29% of them confessed to cheating. Among the cheaters,
male participants (34.2%; OR = 1.92) were more common compared to female participants
(21.3%), and the difference was statistically significant (p = 0.005).
The participants with high GPA scores (4.50–5) were less involved in cheating (22.4%). The
participants with lower GPA scores were more involved in cheating activities, and the results
were statistically significant (p< 0.05). The participants living with their family members were
more likely to cheat (30.9%; OR = 2.77) compared to those living in the university hostel or liv-
ing with their friends (13.9%), and the results were statistically significant (p = 0.032).
Table 2 shows the responses of the participants to different misconduct scenarios. In the
first scenario, a student copies verbatim from the Internet and other published sources (text-
books or papers) and acknowledges the sources in the reference list; 246 (58.4%) participants
expressed that the student mentioned in the scenario was wrong, and 203 (48.2%) participants
had or would consider doing the same in the future. The second scenario related to copying
from the Internet and other published sources (textbooks or research articles) without
acknowledging the sources; 391 (92.2%) participants stated that the student in the scenario
was wrong, whereas 79 (18.8%) had or would consider doing the same in the future. The sum-
marized data for all the scenarios have been provided in Table 2.

 Table 3 shows the responses of the participants by gender to various scenarios of miscon-
duct. In the scenario where a student copies from the Internet and other published sources
(textbooks, research articles) without acknowledging the sources, 391 (92.2%) participants
stated that the student in the scenario was wrong, of whom the majority were females 148
(95.4%) compared with the males 243 (91.3%), but the results were not statistically significant
(OR = 2.01; p = 0.118). Additionally, 79 (18.8%) participants [61 (22.9%) men and 18 (11.6%)
women] had done or would consider doing the same, and the results were statistically signifi-
cant (OR = 2.26; p = 0.005). In the second scenario, where the student copies from assignments
submitted earlier by the senior students, 380 (90.3%) participants [238 (89.5%) men and 142
(91.6%) women] responded that the student in the scenario was wrong. The majority of these
respondents were women [142 (91.6%)] compared to men [238 (89.5%)], and the results were
not statistically significant (OR = 1.28; p = 0.476). However, 104 (27.4%) participants [80

 (30.1%) men and 24 (15.5%) women] have done or would consider doing the same, and the
ratio of men was significantly higher than women (OR = 2.35; p = 0.001). The results of all the
scenarios discussed with the participants are shown in Table 3.
The responses of the participants to different misconduct scenarios related to their aca-
demic grades are given in Table 4. In the scenario where a student copies from the Internet
and other published sources (textbooks or research articles) without acknowledging the
sources, 391 (92.2%) participants stated that the student in the scenario was wrong [of them,
majority with 3.75–4.49 GPA (91.6%, OR = 2.51) and with 4.50–5 GPA (97.3%; OR = 8.21)],
and the results were statistically significant (p<0.05). However, 79 (18.8%) participants had
done or would consider doing the same [of them majority with < 3.75 GPA (31.2%;
OR = 3.33), and with 3.75–4.49 GPA (22.1%; OR = 2.08), compared to the 4.50–5 GPA 22
(12.0%)], and the results were statistically significant (p<0.05). The scenarios and the partici-
pants’ responses are shown in Table 4. Fig 1 summarizes the reasons for cheating given by the
participating students. The participants who admitted that they have cheated justified their
cheating behavior by giving various reasons. Most of the students attributed this act to earning
better grades (24.6%) or to passing the course (21.6%) or because they were not fully prepared
for the exams (17.9%).
Discussion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study conducted at a medical school in Saudi Ara-
bia to investigate this important and sensitive issue of cheating. In the current study, we found
that cheating behavior is prevalent among Saudi medical students, similar to the medical stu-
dents/colleges of other countries, but it is lower in comparison with the previously published
reports [12,13,25]. Approximately 29% of the participants in this study confessed that they had

 cheated during their academic studies, which is less compared with earlier reports showing
25–35% self-reported cheating and up to 90% self-reported plagiarism [13,23].
Cheating can have negative impacts on honesty in the workplace and the quality of the
healthcare system [26,27]. This study investigated the sensitive topic of cheating. The study is
unique as it was conducted in the conservative and religious country of Saudi Arabia, which

 encourages and calls for honesty and ethically perfect behaviors following Islamic Shari’ah law.
Considering the context mentioned above, the prevalence of cheating should be less common.
However, based on the available medical services and clinical expertise present in the country,
it seems that there is an under-reporting of misconduct. Therefore, the present study was con-
ducted to determine the prevalence of cheating and to assess the attitude and the justification
for such misconduct.
In this study, male students were found to be more involved in cheating than female stu-
dents. This finding is supported by three other studies conducted elsewhere [12,13,14]. In con-
trast, Dundee Medical School reported no significant gender difference between the responses
of male and female students [17]. Female students may be apprehensive of being caught as
cheaters and afraid of its consequences on social stigma, while male students seem to be more
nonchalant, careless or bold about cheating regardless of the consequences that they might
face if caught.
We found an inverse relationship between the students’ GPA score and the prevalence of
cheating behavior. The higher GPA students were less involved in such misconduct than those
with lower GPA scores. This finding could be explained by the assumption that a student
achieving a low GPA score wants to pass the exam by any means. In contrast, the students
scoring a high GPA depend on their study for the right answer because of their hard work,
self-confidence, and knowledge that the attempted cheating of lazy students is useless or
unethical. This finding was supported by the previous study performed with pharmacy stu-
dents [14]. However, another study did not find any significant difference in committing aca-
demic misconduct between high and low GPA scoring students [5].
In the present study, the students that lived in the university hostel or with their friends
were less likely to be involved in cheating (1 out of 7 students) compared to those who lived
with their families (1 out of 3 students). An explanation may be that the students living outside,
that is, in a university hostel or with friends, have more free time to study than those living
with their families because of family-related events, social obligations and cultural
responsibilities.
The cheating behavior was considered wrong by almost all the students during the exami-
nation (97.7%). However, around 90% of the participants ignored cheating by others during
exams, despite the fact that approximately 51% of them considered ‘reporting’ to be a good
practice. This behavior is supported by similar findings in a previously published study from
the USA [4].
Surprisingly, in this study, �27% of the participants stated that they had or would consider
forging a professor’s signature on a piece of work. A study conducted in Pakistan demon-
strated a lower percentage of such misconduct [6]. This finding may be explained because of
fewer strict regulations or punishment in the higher education system in Saudi Arabia. There-
fore, implementing stringent rules and punishments is warranted. Additionally, sets of values
and attitudes of the students require more exploration and attention to correct the erroneous
attitudes. The majority of the students in our study justified the act of cheating for reasons of
helping their friends, getting better grades, passing the course or lacking proper preparation
for the examinations.
Academic misconduct must be taken seriously, and following several years of punitive mea-
sures, perhaps it is now time to improve the sense of personal reward and moral identity
related to academic integrity [28]. As a preventive measure, some studies suggested that stu-
dents need awareness and training to avoid plagiarism behavior [29,30]. Likewise, another
study suggested that educators around the world must address cheating in their institutions by
conducting in-depth research on effective ways to reduce its prevalence [31]. Based on the
findings, we think that students must be aware of the effects of cheating on their future careers

 and ultimately the quality of the healthcare they will provide to their community, nation or
humanity. As a remedial measure, some recently introduced courses in the medical degree,
such as ‘professionalism’ and ‘medical ethics,’ need to be reviewed and updated to yield better
outcomes regarding behavioral change. Additionally, religious inclination and practice might
help to prevent academic misconduct, as religious belief is one of the most influential forces to
control any act, thought, mental status or emotional event. Being one of the most religious
states (as Islamic Shari’ah law is strictly practiced in Saudi Arabia) in the world, the religious
strength of Islamic beliefs can be exploited for creating awareness among students to prevent
cheating.
Our study highlights the prevalence and other predisposing factors that can lead to cheating
among medical students and suggests preventive measures. A study conducted in India con-
sidered punishment options that can be applied for academic defaulters and suggested various
categories of punishments to control this behavior [20]. Unfortunately, no strict rules or pun-
ishment options have been suggested or implemented or are available as a preventive measure
in Saudi Arabia. However, an earlier study published in Greece suggested that teaching the
academic honor code may reduce cheating if appropriately applied [18].
Despite the significant findings generated from this study, it is important to mention the
limitations of the present study. For example, (i) various types of biases existed during the
study, that is, response bias and observer effects, (ii) we failed to explore the difference between
the genders showing an increased willingness to report cheating or other academic

 misconduct, and (iii) the applied analysis lacks explanation of confounding variables, for
example, students living away from home are generally males rather than females, and this
might affect the impact of location of residence as a factor. Currently, our group and collabora-
tors are planning future studies to assess the behavioral change outcomes of the students who
take well-designed courses on medical ethics, professionalism, and honor codes and to study
the behaviors of non-compliant students and their reasoning.
Conclusion
In conclusion, we observed a high prevalence of cheating behavior among the Saudi medical
students, predominantly in males, and they deliberately justify their misconduct with strange
reasons; this finding is alarming in a reputable governmental institution and warrants imple-
mentation of some stringent preventive measures. Although some participants tried to justify
their behavior, they still considered it a mistake or misconduct. However, as a preventive strat-
egy, the implementation of strict punishments, introduction of ethical courses, implementa-
tion of a code of conduct, educating students on cheating and plagiarism through workshops
or other means, and the creation of awareness about ethical practices among medical students
by harnessing the potential of Islamic religious belief might be helpful to prevent cheating.
