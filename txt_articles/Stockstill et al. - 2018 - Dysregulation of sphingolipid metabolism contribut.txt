The development of chemotherapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy is a major dose-limiting side effect of many 
chemotherapeutics, including bortezomib, but the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We now report that bortezomib 
causes the dysregulation of de novo sphingolipid metabolism in the spinal cord dorsal horn to increase the levels of 
sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 (S1PR1) ligands, S1P and dihydro-S1P. Accordingly, genetic and pharmacological 
disruption of S1PR1 with multiple S1PR1 antagonists, including FTY720, blocked and reversed neuropathic pain. Mice 
with astrocyte-specific alterations of S1pr1 did not develop neuropathic pain and lost their ability to respond to S1PR1 
inhibition, strongly implicating astrocytes as a primary cellular substrate for S1PR1 activity. At the molecular level, 
S1PR1 engaged astrocyte-driven neuroinflammation and altered glutamatergic homeostasis, processes blocked by 
S1PR1 antagonism. Our findings establish S1PR1 as a target for therapeutic intervention and provide insight into cellular 
and molecular pathways. As FTY720 also shows promising anticancer potential and is FDA approved, rapid clinical 
translation of our findings is anticipated.

Introduction
Bortezomib (Velcade) is a dipeptide boronic acid inhibitor of 
the 26S proteasome widely used in the treatment of multiple 
myeloma and mantle cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (Chen et al., 
2011). More than 40% of patients receiving bortezomib develop 
chronic, distal, and symmetrical sensory peripheral neuropathy 
often accompanied by a neuropathic pain syndrome (chemo-
therapy-induced painful peripheral neuropathy [CIPN]) that 
may last for weeks, months, or even years after drug termination 
(Farquhar-Smith, 2011). CIPN greatly compromises the quality 
of life of cancer survivors and patients under treatment and can 
interfere with effective anticancer treatment (Farquhar-Smith, 
2011). Dose reduction or treatment discontinuation is often the 
sole recourse for patients who develop neuropathic pain, because 
traditional analgesics are ineffective or have their own serious 
unwanted side effects (Farquhar-Smith, 2011). Advances in 
strategies to address this growing problem are urgently needed 
with increased efficacy of cancer therapy that has resulted in 
nearly 14 million cancer survivors in the United States (de Moor 
et al., 2013), many suffering from these long-term side effects 
(Farquhar-Smith, 2011). The mechanisms underlying CIPN 
remain poorly understood and differ among the chemotherapeu-
tic agents (Han and Smith, 2013). However, neuropathological 
changes in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (DHSC) have been 
documented (Han and Smith, 2013).
As a desirable anticancer mechanism, bortezomib activates 
the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway to produce the potent 
proapoptotic sphingolipid ceramide (Gong et al., 2014). Ceramide 
is hydrolyzed by ceramidases to sphingosine that is phosphor-
ylated by sphingosine kinases (SphK1 and 2) to produce sphin-
gosine-1-phosphate (S1P; Spiegel and Milstien, 2011). S1P initi-
ates signaling through a family of five cognate G protein–coupled 
receptors (S1PR1–5; Spiegel and Milstien, 2011) and, in contrast 
to ceramide, is a potent antiapoptotic sphingolipid (Ogretmen 
and Hannun, 2004). It is hypothesized that the ceramide/S1P 
rheostat plays a critical role in regulating cancer cell fate with 
elevated levels of ceramide inducing cell death and elevated

levels of S1P leading to survival and proliferation (Ogretmen and 
Hannun, 2004). Thus, therapeutic strategies aimed at reducing 
S1P bioavailability or signaling are attracting attention as novel 
anticancer agents (Ogretmen and Hannun, 2004). Numerous 
studies have demonstrated that the S1PR1 functional antagonist 
and orally available multiple sclerosis drug FTY720 (fingolimod; 
Gilenya; Brinkmann et al., 2010) has potent antitumor activity 
(Hait et al., 2015; White et al., 2016) and can synergize with bor-
tezomib to target multiple myeloma cells in vitro and multiple 
myeloma in vivo xenografts (Beider et al., 2017).
Despite having opposing effects on cancer cells, compel-
ling evidence is emerging that ceramide and S1P share potent 
inflammatory and nociceptive actions (Salvemini et al., 2013). 
It is noteworthy that altered sphingolipid metabolism caused 
by mutations in serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) contrib-
utes to neuropathic pain in humans (Dawkins et al., 2001). 
Whether sphingolipid dysregulation drives bortezomib-in-
duced neuropathic pain is not known. Here, we demonstrate 
that S1PR1-dependent neuroinflammatory signaling pathways 
contribute to the development of bortezomib-induced neuro-
pathic pain identifying S1PR1 as a molecular target for thera-
peutic intervention.
Results and discussion
Dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism by bortezomib
Bioactive sphingolipid metabolites are powerful signaling 
molecules, and minor changes are known to have significant 
impact in signal transduction (Hannun and Obeid, 2008). Liq-
uid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) analysis of multiple sphin-
golipid species (Fig. 1 A) revealed that bortezomib treatment 
(Zheng et al., 2012; Janes et al., 2013) caused dysregulation 
of sphingolipid metabolism in the DHSC. Indeed, bortezomib 
induced significant increases in the levels of ceramide (Figs. 1 
B and S1 A) and its de novo biosynthetic pathway precursors, 
dihydrosphingosine and dihydroceramide (Figs. 1 B and S1 B). 
Bortezomib also increased the levels of sphingosine, S1P, and 
dihydro-S1P (DH-S1P), which are metabolites of ceramide and 
dihydroceramide (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, there were no observ-
able changes in sphingomyelin (Fig. 1 B). These results suggest 
that dysregulation of sphingolipid metabolism from the de novo 
pathway within the DHSC is among the early events of bortezo-
mib-induced neuropathic pain. Dysregulation of sphingolipid 
metabolism was associated with time-dependent development 
of neuropathic pain (mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyper-
algesia; Figs. 2 and S2). Our sphingolipidomic data supporting 
the contribution of the de novo pathway in bortezomib-induced 
neuropathic pain were substantiated with studies performed 
with myriocin, a well-characterized inhibitor of SPT (Delgado 
et al., 2006), the first and rate-limiting enzyme of de novo 
pathway. Myriocin, when used at doses reported to block SPT 
(Delgado et al., 2006) and S1P levels in DHSC (Muscoli et al., 
2010) significantly attenuated the development of neuropathic 
pain (Fig. 1, C and D). Collectively, the data strongly suggest that 
bortezomib alters S1P signaling by triggering SPT and de novo 
sphingolipid metabolism.
Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the S1PR1 axis 
mitigates bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain
Because S1P and DH-S1P are potent bioactive mediators and 
ligands with similar affinities for S1PR1 (Strub et al., 2010), we 
explored the functional contribution of S1PR1 using NIBR14, a 
methyl ester prodrug that is rapidly hydrolyzed in vivo to the 
carboxylic acid, NIBR15, a potent and selective S1PR1 antagonist 
(Angst et al., 2012). i.th. administration of NIBR14 attenuated the 
development of mechano-allodynia and mechano-hyperalgesia 
in rats (Figs. 2 A and S2 A). In support of these pharmacological 
effects, i.th. administration of S1pr1-targeting dicer-substrate 
short interfering RNA (DsiRNA) during bortezomib treatment 
recapitulated the pharmacological blockade (Figs. 2 B and S2 
B) by significantly reducing S1PR1 protein levels in the DHSC 
(Fig. 2 C). These data provide convergent evidence that blocking 
S1PR1 signaling mitigates bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain.
The pharmacological efficacy and potency of oral adminis-
tration of S1PR1-targeted agents, which is the preferred clini-
cal approach, was examined using S1PR1 competitive (NIBR14) 
and functional (FTY720, ponesimod) antagonists (Bigaud et al., 
2014). FTY720 (once phosphorylated by SphK2 to the biologically 
active FTY720-P) and ponesimod are S1PR1 agonists that act as 
“functional antagonists” by potently and irreversibly down-reg-
ulating S1PR1 (Bigaud et al., 2014). Oral administration of NIBR14 
or FTY720 during bortezomib treatment dose-dependently pre-
vented neuropathic pain from developing for the 20-d observa-
tion period after the completion of bortezomib treatment (Figs. 
2, D and E; and S2, C and D; ED50 values in Table 1). Oral admin-
istration of ponesimod exhibited similar beneficial effects (Fig. 
S2, E and F). The beneficial effects observed with FTY720 were 
independently verified by another laboratory in our group using 
another method of behavioral assessment (Fig. 2, F and G).
Numerous studies have convincingly demonstrated the anti-
tumor effects of FTY720 on many types of cancer cells in vitro 
and in tumor-bearing animals (Yasui et al., 2005; Alinari et al., 
2011; Neviani et al., 2013; Hait et al., 2015). Therefore, S1PR1 
agents are not expected to reduce the chemotherapeutic effec-
tiveness of bortezomib. We confirmed this with in vitro tumor 
cell–killing studies using FTY720. Based on pharmacokinetic 
studies in rats (Brinkmann et al., 2010), the anticipated plasma 
levels of FTY720 at doses providing maximal blockade of bortezo-
mib-induced neuropathic pain are ∼0.5–0.7 nM. When tested at a 
much higher dose, FTY720 (5 µM) did not significantly diminish 
the in vitro tumor cell toxicity of bortezomib in human multiple 
myeloma (RPMI 8226) cells (LC50, 34 nM; 95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 27–42 nM; n = 5) compared with bortezomib and vehicle 
(LC50, 31 nM; 95% CI, 23–42 nM; n = 5).
Astrocytes are a primary cellular substrate for S1PR1 activity 
after bortezomib treatment
In the central nervous system (CNS), astrocytes express much 
higher levels of S1PR1 than microglia and neurons (Zhang et al., 
2014), marking these cells as a prime target for S1PR1 signaling 
in the development of bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain. To 
test this possibility, we used mice with floxed S1pr1 recombined 
with a cre gene under the control of a glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein (Gfap) promoter that results in the deletion of S1pr1 in GFAP+

astrocytes in the CNS (Choi et al., 2011). We confirmed the dele-
tion of S1pr1 in the spinal cord (Fig. 3, A and B) and intact S1pr1 
in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) tissues (Fig. 3 A). When compared 
with control littermates, male mice with astrocyte-specific dele-
tions of S1pr1 did not develop neuropathic pain (Fig. 3 C). In ani-
mal models of multiple sclerosis, Choi et al. (2011) demonstrated 
that these mice develop a lesser form of the disease while losing 
the ability to respond to FTY720. Because in our pain model the 
complete deletion of S1pr1 from astrocytes resulted in no devel-
opment of pain, we used mice with astrocyte-specific reductions 
of S1pr1 to examine the role of S1pr1 in astrocytes on the pharma-
cological effects of S1PR1 antagonists. Mice with astrocyte-spe-
cific reductions of S1pr1 had delayed development of neuropathic 
pain compared with controls and, because of reduced levels of 
S1PR1, they also lost their responsiveness to the beneficial effects 
of FTY720 (Fig. 3 D). These data, which mimic those obtained 
with S1PR1 antagonists and siRNA, strongly suggest that acti-
vation S1PR1 signaling in astrocytes is necessary for both bor-
tezomib-induced neuropathic pain and the analgesic effects of 
FTY720, thus identifying astrocytes as a primary cellular sub-
strate of S1PR1 activity.
S1PR1-driven neuroinflammation contributes to bortezomib-
induced neuropathic pain
Bortezomib-induced dysregulation of sphingolipid metabo-
lism in the spinal cord was associated with increased levels of 
the astrocyte marker GFAP (Fig. 4, A–D and G) in the super-
ficial dorsal horn (laminae I and II), confirming a previous 
study (Robinson et al., 2014). The increase in GFAP suggests an 
increase in the number of astrocytes, their activation, or both in 
the DHSC in response to bortezomib. S1P triggers astrocytes to 
become reactive (Sorensen et al., 2003), and activation of S1PR1 
can induce astrocyte migration in culture (Mullershausen et al., 
2007). In other neurodegenerative diseases with a prominent 
astrocyte-driven inflammatory component (e.g., multiple scle-
rosis, Alzheimer’s disease, or Huntington’s disease), blocking the 
S1PR1 axis with S1PR1 antagonists attenuates astrocyte activation 
and inhibits increased production of inflammatory cytokines in 
the spinal cord; in contrast, levels of IL-10 increase (Brinkmann 
et al., 2010; O’Sullivan and Dev, 2017). These antiinflammatory 
effects of S1PR1 antagonism are further supported by a recent 
study showing that FTY720 can prevent endotoxin activation, 
migration, and ensuing release of inflammatory mediators in 
primary astrocyte cultures, but not microglia (Rothhammer et 
al., 2017). In our study, bortezomib-induced dysregulation of 
sphingolipid metabolism was also associated with concomitant 
increases in TNF and IL-1β (Fig. 4, H and I). In contrast, antiin-
flammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-4) decreased compared with 
those in vehicle-treated rats (Fig. 4, J and K). Concurrent admin-
istration of FTY720 attenuated increased GFAP immunolabeling 
(Fig. 4, E–G) and production of TNF and IL-1β (Fig. 4, H and I) 
associated with bortezomib treatment while preventing reduc-
tions in IL10 and IL4 (Fig. 4, J and K). Similar effects on cytokine 
expression were obtained with ponesimod (Fig. 4, H–K). This 
S1PR1-driven neuroinflammation in the spinal cord may, in turn, 
establish “feed-forward” mechanisms that can sustain dysregu-
lation of sphingolipid metabolism. For example, TNF and IL-1β 
can activate the major enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of 
ceramide and S1P pathways: SphK1, sphingomyelinases, SPT, and 
ceramidases (Snider et al., 2010). Interruption of this cross talk 
early in the bortezomib regimen may explain how neuropathic 
pain is prevented with S1PR1-targeted agents from developing 
for many days after bortezomib discontinuation (Figs. 2 and S2).
S1PR1-driven alterations in glutamatergic signaling
Spinal synaptic mechanisms underlying the development of 
bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain have not been identified. 
We investigated whether glutamatergic synaptic activities in the 
DHSC of rats with bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain were 
altered using whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques. 
Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were 
recorded from neurons in the spinal outer lamina II receiving 
monosynaptic input from the primary afferents (Yoshimura 
and Jessell, 1989; Weng et al., 2006). Alterations in mEPSC fre-
quency indicate changes in the presynaptic transmitter release 
probability, whereas alteration in mEPSC amplitude indicates 
changes in the postsynaptic glutamate receptor function (Lissin 
et al., 1999; Yan et al., 2013; Yan and Weng, 2013). We found that

on PWT in vehicle-treated rats (not depicted). (C) Representative blots showing S1PR1 protein in DHSC from rats receiving siS1PR1 (n = 3) or siNT (n = 3). (D

and concurrent oral NIBR14 (0.3, 1, or 3 mg/kg/d; n = 6 per group in D), oral FTY720 (0.003, 0.03, or 0.1 mg/kg/d; n = 6 per group; or 0.3 mg/kg/d; n = 3 in E), 
or their vehicles (10 or 2% DMSO in saline; n = 7 in D; or n = 11 in E). (F and G) Mechano-hypersensitivity was measured in rats treated with bortezomib and

both the frequency (6.10 ± 0.44 Hz) and amplitude (26.37 ± 0.52 
pA) of mEPSCs in neurons from rats with bortezomib-induced 
neuropathic pain were significantly higher (P < 0.0001, Welch’s 
uncorrected t test) than in vehicle-treated rats (frequency, 3.14 ± 
0.33 Hz; amplitude, 22.87 ± 0.77 pA), suggesting that glutamate 
release from presynaptic terminals and ligand-gated glutamate 
receptor function in postsynaptic neurons are enhanced in bor-
tezomib-treated rats (Fig. 4, L–O).
Previous studies by others and us have shown that spinal 
glutamatergic synaptic activities are enhanced by inflammatory 
mediators (e.g., TNF, IL-1β, and MCP1) under pathological pain 
conditions (Kawasaki et al., 2008; Yan and Weng, 2013). How-
ever, their regulation by the S1PR1 axis is not known. NIBR15 
treatment significantly reduced the mEPSC frequency, but not 
amplitude, from 6.10 ± 0.44 Hz to 4.09 ± 0.23 Hz (Fig. 4, L and 
N) in DHSC neurons from rats with bortezomib-induced neu-
ropathic pain. Furthermore, perfusion of the selective S1PR1 
agonist SEW2871 in normal rats significantly increased mEPSC 
frequency with no significant change in amplitude (Fig. 4, M and 
O). Collectively, these data suggest that S1P in the DHSC of borte-
zomib-treated rats enhances glutamate release from presynaptic 
terminals, which is blocked by S1PR1-targeted agents.
These findings demonstrate the dysregulation of excitatory 
glutamatergic signaling as a second factor contributing to neu-
ropathic pain induced by chemotherapeutics (Boyette-Davis et 
al., 2015). More importantly, our study demonstrates for the first

time that S1PR1 signaling is responsible for increased presynaptic 
glutamate release and the genesis of bortezomib-induced neu-
ropathic pain. Because we found that the development of neuro-
pathic pain is lost when S1PR1 is deleted in astrocytes (Fig. 3 C) 
and FTY720 lost its effectiveness when S1PR1 is reduced in astro-
cytes (Fig. 3 D), it is likely that S1PR1-targeted agents suppress 
astrocyte activity and ensuing neuroinflammation (Rothhammer 
et al., 2017), attenuating the ability of proinflammatory cytokines 
to enhance glutamatergic synaptic activity (Clark et al., 2013).
S1PR1-targeted agents reverse bortezomib-induced 
neuropathic pain
The increased efficacy of cancer therapy has led to nearly 14 mil-
lion cancer survivors in the United States (de Moor et al., 2013). 
Many of these survivors continue to suffer from long-term neu-
ropathic pain states that are poorly managed. To address this 
major unmet medical need, we examined the effectiveness of tar-
geting S1PR1 in models of established bortezomib-induced neu-
ropathic pain. At the time of peak pain (day 25), subcutaneous

Sphingolipids and S1PR1 in bortezomib-induced pain

minipump infusions of FYT720, ponesimod, or NIBR14 over 6 d 
(Janes et al., 2014) completely reversed neuropathic pain (Fig. S3) 
throughout the entire period of drug infusion.
The mechanisms of bortezomib dysregulation of sphin-
golipid metabolism are not known, but several possibilities 
are envisioned (Fig. 4 P). The limited ability of bortezomib 
to cross the blood–brain barrier (Adams et al., 1999) suggests 
that sphingolipid metabolism in the CNS may be triggered 
by peripheral inflammatory changes (Seruga et al., 2008). 
Accordingly, bortezomib increases levels of various proinflam-
matory cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1β (Liang et al., 2014), 
in plasma that gain access to the CNS (Yarlagadda et al., 2009) 
and activate de novo biosynthesis to increase DH-S1P and S1P 
(Snider et al., 2010; Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014). Alternatively, 
bortezomib-induced events in the DRG (Carozzi et al., 2013) 
may provoke production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen 
species (Duggett and Flatters, 2017) and release of glutamate 
(Ghelardini et al., 2014) from presynaptic nerve endings that 
could activate glial sphingolipid metabolism (Kim et al., 2012). 
The resulting increased S1PR1 signaling in astrocytes promotes 
their activation, migration, and ensuing release of inflamma-
tory mediators (Rothhammer et al., 2017) to reinforce neuroin-
flammation and drive the establishment and maintenance of 
the neuronal sensitization in the CNS. In turn, enhanced reac-
tive oxygen and nitrogen species or glutamatergic signaling 
may perpetuate the cycle and transition the DHSC toward a 
chronic hypersensitized state.
In conclusion, by using a multidisciplinary approach, our 
studies provide new insight into the underlying S1PR1-driven 
mechanisms engaged during bortezomib-induced neuropathic 
pain and establish the foundation for proof-of-concept stud-
ies with S1PR1-targeted agents that are already in clinical use 
(FTY720; Brinkmann et al., 2010) or advanced clinical trials for 
other indications (ponesimod; Bigaud et al., 2014). Our studies 
provide a compelling case for the consideration of repurposing 
FTY720 as an adjuvant to bortezomib for the prevention and 
treatment of chemotherapy-related neurotoxicity to address an 
immense unmet medical need.
Materials and methods
Experimental animals
Male Sprague Dawley rats (200–220 g starting weight) were from 
Harlan Laboratories. For S1pr1 knockout and knockdown mice, 
transgenic mouse colonies were descendants of original homozy-
gous S1pr1fl/fl;GFAP-Cre breeder mice gifted to us by J. Chun (The 
Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA; Choi et al., 2011) and inter-
bred to maintain their homozygosity for the floxed S1pr1 gene 
with regular backcrosses with C57BL/6J wild-type mice (Harlan 
Laboratories) to reduce inbred genetic defects. Prior characteri-
zations of these conditional mutants showed the removal of S1pr1 
from GFAP+ astrocytes in the CNS (Choi et al., 2011). Mice with 
astrocyte-specific deletion of S1pr1 (S1pr1fl/fl;GFAP-Cre) and their 
control littermates (S1pr1fl/fl) were generated from mating male 
S1pr1fl/fl mice with female S1pr1fl/fl;GFAP-Cre mice. Mice with 
astrocyte-specific reductions in S1pr1 (S1pr1fl/+;GFAP-Cre) and 
their control littermates (S1pr1fl/+) were generated from mating 
male C57BL/6J wild-type mice with female S1pr1fl/fl;GFAP-Cre 
mice. All mice were genotyped before breeding or use in exper-
iments by endpoint PCR of ear-punch DNA. The primers used 
to detect floxed and deleted S1pr1 were spb1 (Invitrogen; 5′-TTC 
TAG 
CCA 
AGG 
CAT 
TGC 
TCCA-3′), Edg1M/S1pr1 (IDT; 5′-CCT

were gfap-cre forward (5′-ATG

TGG 
CTC 
CAG 
GTA 
CC-3′) and 
cre reverse (5′-CAG 
CAT 
TGC 
TGT 
CAC 
TTG 
GTC-3′). All mice were 
ear-tagged for identification, and sex- and age-matched litter-
mate controls were used in all experiments.
Animals were housed two to four per cage (for rats), five per 
cage (for mice), or single housed after surgery in a controlled 
environment (12-h light/dark cycle) with food and water avail-
able ad libitum. All experiments were conducted with the exper-
imenters blinded to treatment conditions. All experiments were 
performed in accordance with the guidelines of the International 
Association for the Study of Pain and the National Institutes of 
Health and approvals from the Saint Louis University, University 
of Georgia, and the University of California, San Diego, Institu-
tional Animal Care and Use Committees.
i.th. catheters
i.th. compounds (10 µl) were administered via cannulas made 
from PE10 tubing (427401; Becton Dickinson) that were chron-
ically implanted in rats by using the L5/L6 lumbar approach as 
previously described (Little et al., 2012).
Osmotic minipump
Rodents were lightly anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and main-
tained on 2% isoflurane in 100% O2. An incision was made in the 
interscapular region for subcutaneous implantation of primed 
7-d osmotic minipumps (Alzet 2001; Alza) that infused 1 µl/h as 
previously described (Janes et al., 2014). Minipumps were filled 
according to the manufacturer's specifications with test com-
pounds or their vehicle. Immediately after surgery, i.p. loading 
doses of test compounds or their vehicle were administered, 
and minipumps were allowed to deliver test agents for 6 d. After 
implantation, the animals were singly housed for the remainder 
of the experiment.
Bortezomib-induced neuropathic pain model
In rats, bortezomib (S1013; Selleck Chemicals) or its vehicle (5% 
Tween 80, P1754 [Sigma-Aldrich]; 5% ethanol, 493546 [Sigma-Al-
drich]; and saline) was administered by i.p. injection in rats on 5 
consecutive days (day 0 to day 4; 0.2 mg/kg) at an injection vol-
ume of 0.2 ml for a final cumulative dose of 1 mg/kg (Janes et 
al., 2013). In mice, bortezomib (0.4 mg/kg i.p.) was administered 
every other day three times per week for 4 wk (day 0 to day 25).
Test compounds
All compounds in the prevention models were administered 
concurrent with bortezomib at the doses and by the routes 
described in the text after behavior measurements. For the 
reversal studies, compounds were administered via osmotic 
minipumps implanted on D24 or D25. FTY720 (fingolimod) was 
purchased from Cayman Chemical (162359-56-8). Ponesimod

oxy)-benzylidene]-2-propylimino-3-O-tolylthiazolidin-4-one) 
was prepared by Shanghai ChemPartner Co. according to the 
method of Bolli et al. (2010).
For synthesis of NIBR14, the methyl ester pro-drug, the Novar-
tis competitive antagonist NIBR14 (mol wt = 600.17) was pre-
pared as described in the literature (Angst et al., 2012). Molecular 
identity was confirmed by LCMS (50–95% acetonitrile in 0.05% 
TFA over 6 min) performed by using a Waters Alliance SQ 3100 
system (positive ion electrospray mode) with an Agilent Eclipse 
(XDB-C18; 4.6 × 150 mm, 5 μm) column (retention time = 7.15 min; 
C31H38ClN3O5S; m/z = 600 [M + H+]).
For synthesis of NIBR15, the methyl ester prodrug NIBR14 
(90 mg, 0.15 µmol) was dissolved in 6 ml acetic acid and treated 
with 1.5 ml of concentrated HCl. This mixture was stirred at 50°C 
for 12 h and concentrated. Recrystallization from acetonitrile 
afforded 45 mg (48% yield) NIBR15 HCl salt (mol wt = 622.60), 
confirmed by LCMS (15–95% acetonitrile in 0.05% TFA over 6 
min; retention time = 6.97 min; C30H37Cl2N3O5S; m/z = 586 ([M +

CrGrArUrUrArArCrGrArC-5′; Walk et al., 2012) were diluted in 
RNase-free water to 0.2 µg/µl. S1pr1-targeting (siS1PR1) or siNT 
sequence (10 µl) was administered after bortezomib injections 
via i.th. catheters on days 0, 2, and 4.
Behavioral testing
Baseline behavioral measurements to assess mechano-hypersen-
sitivity were always taken before the daily administration of test 
substances or their vehicles. Pilot tests to examine the effects of 
S1PR1 antagonists alone in vehicle-treated rats excluded a poten-
tial impact of S1PR1 antagonism on baseline paw withdrawal 
thresholds (PWTs). Thus, systemic or i.th. injections of FTY720 
and NIBR14 did not alter baseline PWTs when given alone at the 
highest dose used in our manuscript in rats that received the 
vehicle of bortezomib only. Accordingly, we did not include a 
vehicle plus S1PR1 antagonist group in our experimental design.
Mechano-allodynia was measured as previously described 
(Janes et al., 2014). Mechanical PWT in grams [PWT, (g)] was 
measured using an electronic von Frey test (dynamic plantar aes-
thesiometer, model 37450; Ugo Basile) with a cutoff set at 50 g in 
rats or calibrated von Frey filaments (Stoelting; range in mice: 
0.07–2.00 g; in rats: 2–26 g) using the “up-and-down” method 
(Dixon, 1980). Mechano-allodynia was defined as a significant (P 
< 0.05) reduction in mechanical mean absolute PWT (g) at forces 
that failed to elicit withdrawal responses before chemotherapy 
treatment (day 0). Mechano-hyperalgesia was measured in the 
rat hind paw using the Randall and Sellitto paw pressure test as 
previously described (Janes et al., 2014) by using an analgesiom-
eter (model 37215; Ugo Basile). The nociceptive PWT (g) was mea-
sured as the force that caused the rat to withdraw its paw (cutoff 
set at 250 g). Mechano-hyperalgesia was defined as a significant 
(P < 0.05) reduction in nociceptive PWT (g) compared with 
withdrawal responses before chemotherapy treatment (day 0). 
The values from both paws were averaged because chemothera-
py-induced neuropathy results in bilateral allodynia and hyper-
algesia with no differences between left and right hind PWT (g). 
The ED50 and the corresponding 95% CI were determined from 
dose responses by curve fitting the percentage of prevention of 
mechano-allodynia or mechano-hyperalgesia on day 25 using the 
least sum of square method by a normalized three-parameter, 
nonlinear analysis (Hill slope = 1) with the use of GraphPad Prism 
(Release 5.03; GraphPad Software, Inc.). The percentage of pre-
vention = (PWT (g)treatment − mean PWT (g)bortezomib)/(mean PWT 
(g)vehicle − mean PWT (g)bortezomib) × 100.
In studies performed by an independent laboratory from our 
group, behavior was measured by using a previously reported 
von Frey method (Siau et al., 2006). In brief, 4 and 15 g of von 
Frey hairs were applied bilaterally to the plantar hind paw five 
times per side with 1–2 min between successive stimuli, and 
the percentage of stimuli that elicited a withdrawal reflex was 
recorded. A significant increase in the number of responses to 
the 4 g of hair is indicative of mechano-allodynia, and an increase 
to the 15 g of hair indicates mechano-hyperalgesia.
Sphingolipid analysis by MS
After lipid extraction, sphingolipids were quantified by 
LC-ESI-MS/MS (4000 QTR 
AP; AB Sciex) as described previously 
(Hait et al., 2009).
Western blot
Total protein lysates (rat, 20 µg; mouse, 5 µg) from L4–6 were 
denatured in Laemmli’s buffer, resolved on 4–20% SDS-PAGE, 
and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The mem-
branes were blocked for 1 h in 5% milk in 1× PBS, pH 7.4, with 
0.05% Tween 20, probed overnight with rabbit anti–S1PR1 anti-
body (rat, 1:5,000; mouse, 1:30,000; ab11424; Abcam; and MA/
PA1-1040; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized with goat 
anti–rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (1 h, room tempera-
ture [RT], 1:10,000–15,000, 7074; Cell Signaling Technology) 
and Clarity chemiluminescent reagents (1705061; BioRad). The 
signal was documented using a ChemiDoc imager (BioRad) and 
analyzed using ImageLab Software v.5.0 (BioRad). Horseradish 
peroxidase bound to the membrane was inactivated by two incu-
bations in 30% H2O2 at RT for 15 min (Sennepin et al., 2009) and 
reprobed for β-actin by using mouse anti–β-actin antibody, clone 
AC-15 (1 h, RT; rat, 1:2,000; mouse, 1:10,000; A5441; Sigma-Al-
drich) and goat anti–mouse IgG–horseradish peroxidase (1 h, 
RT; 1:3,000; 04-18-15; KPL). The density of the S1PR1 band was 
normalized to the corresponding β-actin band and expressed as 
percent S1PR1/β-actin.

S1PR1 knockdown PCR
Ear snip, spinal cord, or DRG DNA was isolated by using a QIAmp 
DNA mini isolation kit (Qiagen) and quantitated by NanoDrop 
(NanoDrop Products) for PCR as previously described (Choi et 
al., 2011). In brief, DNA (20–25 ng) was subjected to PCR (25 µl) in 
duplicate by using two separate PCR reactions: (1) Edg1M (S1pr1)

by using the following amplification cycle conditions: 94°C, 5

cation cycle conditions: 94°C, 3 min; 35 cycles (94°C, 25 s; 59°C, 
35 s; 72°C, 45 s); and 72°C, 7 min. Blue/orange 6× loading dye (2 µl; 
Promega) was added, and 10 ng PCR product was loaded for 1.8% 
agarose gel electrophoresis in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. When 
measured against a 100-bp DNA ladder (Promega), PCR yielded 
the following bands: 177 bp (wild-type S1pr1), 335 bp (floxed 
S1pr1), 450 bp (deletion product), and 625 bp (Gfap-cre). Animals 
with a 450-bp band in ear snip DNA samples indicated germline 
deletions of S1PR1 and were excluded from breeding and experi-
ments. For each experiment, the heterozygous S1pr1fl/+;Gfap-Cre 
mice were paired with their heterozygous S1pr1fl/+ littermates, 
and their genotypes were blinded to the experimenters.
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence and image analysis was performed by using 
modifications to previously reported methods (Little et al., 2012; 
Janes et al., 2014). The spinal cord (L4–6) was harvested, trans-
ferred to optimum cutting temperature compound, and rapidly 
frozen in an isopropanol/dry ice bath. Transverse sections (20 
µm) were cut by using a cryostat, collected on gelatin-coated 
glass microscope slides, and stored at −20°C. Spinal cord sections 
were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for 10 min (SF100; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific), blocked (10% normal goat serum 
10000C; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 2% BSA, BP9706; Thermo 
Fisher Scientific; and 0.2% Triton X-100, T8787; Sigma-Aldrich) 
in PBS (BP39920; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 1 h and then 
immunolabeled by using an 18-h incubation (4°C) with mouse 
monoclonal anti-GFAP antibody, clone G-A-5 (1:200, G3893; Sig-
ma-Aldrich). After a series of PBS rinses, sections were incubated 
for 2 h with a goat anti–mouse Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (1:250, 
A-11001; Invitrogen). The coverslips were mounted with Fluoro-
gel II containing DAPI (17985-51; Electron Microscopy Sciences) 
and photographed with an Olympus FV1000 MPE confocal micro-
scope (multiline argon lasers with excitation at 405 nm and 488 
nm) using a 10× objective (UPL 
SAPO; 0.4 numerical aperture) 
for regional fluorescence intensity image analysis and with a 60× 
oil-immersion objective (PLA 
PONl, 1.42 numerical aperture) and 
2.4× optical zoom (0.1-µm pixel dimensions in the X–Y plane and 
the pinhole set at 1 Airy unit) for higher magnification images. 
Images were acquired within the dynamic range of the micro-
scope (i.e., no pixel intensity values of 0 or 255 in an 8-bit image). 
Sections treated with isotype control (X0931; Agilent-Dako) at 
concentrations equivalent to the primary antibody yielded only 
nonspecific background fluorescence. Image analysis of GFAP 
immunolabeling was performed by using the National Institutes 
of Health freeware program ImageJ (version 1.43; Schneider et 
al., 2012). The bilateral superficial DHSC (laminae I and II) at the 
L4, L5, and L6 levels was outlined on images using the ImageJ 
region of interest tool. The superficial DHSC was determined and 
confirmed by using adjacent cresyl violet–stained sections and 
an atlas (Paxinos and Watson, 1998). Images received automated 
background threshold corrections (histogram-based threshold) 
before analysis. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of the 
superficial DHSC was determined as previously reported (Little 
et al., 2012; Janes et al., 2014). MFI was calculated using the fol-
lowing equation: MFI = i(pp2 ÷ p2), where i is the mean gray value, 
pp2 is the positive pixel area, and p2 is total pixel area. There were 
no significant differences bilaterally within each group, so MFI 
was calculated as a combined value for each animal and reported 
as fold change compared with the vehicle group.
Cytokine assays
Cytokine levels were assessed in DHSC (L4–6) homogenates 
using a commercially available multiplex cytokine kit (Bio-Rad 
Laboratories) as previously described (Janes et al., 2014).
In vitro whole-cell recordings and data analysis
Male Sprague Dawley rats (170–180 g) were administered bor-
tezomib (0.2 mg/kg) or its vehicle (5% Tween 80, 5% ethanol 
in saline) on days 0–4. This resulted in significantly reduced 
(40.47 ± 8.13%; P < 0.001) mechanical PWTs by day 7 with bor-
tezomib treatment. On day 7, traverse L4–5 spinal cord slices 
were prepared as previously described (Weng et al., 2007; Nie 
and Weng, 2009). Surgery was performed in deeply isoflu-
rane-anesthetized rats to expose and remove the spinal lum-
bar enlargement segments. The section was placed in ice-cold 
sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (234 mM sucrose, 3.6 mM 
KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 12.0 mM 
glucose, and 25.0 mM NaHCO3) presaturated with 95% O2 and 
5% CO2. The pia-arachnoid membrane was removed from the 
section before it was attached with cyanoacrylate glue to a 
cutting support and then glued onto the stage of a vibratome 
(Series 1000; Technical Products International). Transverse 
spinal cord slices (400 µm) were cut in the ice-cold sucrose 
artificial cerebrospinal fluid and preincubated in Krebs solu-
tion (117.0 mM NaCl, 3.6 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl2, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 
1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 11.0 mM glucose, and 25.0 mM NaHCO3 at 
35°C) oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 at 35°C. Each sin-
gle slice was placed in the recording chamber (volume, 1.5 ml), 
perfused with Krebs solution at 35°C, and saturated with 95% 
O2 and 5% CO2. Borosilicate glass recording electrodes (resis-
tance, 3–5 MΩ) were pulled and filled with an internal solution 
containing 135 mM potassium-gluconate, 5.0 mM KCl, 2.0 mM 
MgCl2, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 5.0 mM Hepes, 5.0 mM EGTA, 5.0 mM 
ATP-Mg, 0.5 mM Na-GTP, and 10 mM QX-314.
Live dorsal horn neurons in the spinal outer lamina II were 
visualized by microscopy and approached by using a three-di-
mensional motorized manipulator (Sutter Instrument), 
and whole-cell configurations were established by applying

moderate negative pressure after electrode contact (Nakatsuka 
et al., 2003). Recordings of mEPSCs were made from neurons 
receiving monosynaptic input from the primary afferents by 
using the criteria established previously (Yoshimura and Jessell, 
1989; Weng et al., 2006). mEPSCs were recorded at a membrane 
potential at −70 mV in the presence of 1 µM tetrodotoxin (T8024; 
Sigma-Aldrich), 10 µM bicuculline (14340; Sigma-Aldrich), and 
5 µM strychnine (S0532; Sigma-Aldrich) in the external solu-
tion to block voltage-gated sodium channels, GABAA, and glycine 
receptors. Data were recorded using Axopatch 700B amplifiers, 
digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed off-line. The frequency and 
amplitude of mEPSCs in 3 min before and during perfusion of 
tested drugs were analyzed and averaged using a peak detection 
program (MiniAnalysis; Synaptosoft Inc.).
Tumor cell–killing assays
The effects of FTY720 on the tumor cell toxicity of bortezomib 
on human multiple myeloma cells (RPMI 8226) was assessed by 
using an MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-
zolium bromide, M5655; Sigma-Aldrich) assay as previously 
described (Janes et al., 2013).
Statistical analysis
The data are expressed as mean ± SD or mean ± SEM for n animals 
and analyzed by paired or unpaired t test or one-way or two-way 
repeated-measures ANO 
VA with Holm-Sidak corrected compar-
isons. Significant differences were defined as P < 0.05, and the 
false discovery rate for sphingolipid analysis was controlled by 
Benjamini-Hochberg procedure at q < 0.05 using SPSS software 
(v21; IBM). All other statistical analyses were performed using 
GraphPad Prism.
