Abstract
Circulating antibodies can access most tissues to mediate surveillance and elimination of invading 
pathogens. Immunopriviledged tissues such as the brain and the peripheral nervous system, are 
shielded from plasma proteins, by the blood-brain barrier1 and blood nerve barrier2, respectively. 
Yet, circulating antibodies must somehow gain access to these tissues in order to mediate their 
antimicrobial functions. Here, we examine the mechanism by which antibodies gain access to 
neuronal tissues to control infection. Using mouse model of genital herpes infection, we 
demonstrate that both antibodies and CD4 T cells are required to protect the host following 
immunization at a distal site. We show that memory CD4 T cells migrate to the dorsal root ganglia 
(DRG) and spinal cord in response to HSV-2 infection. Once inside these neuronal tissues, CD4 T 
cells secrete interferon (IFN)-γ and mediate local increase in vascular permeability, enabling 
antibody access for viral control. A similar requirement for CD4 T cells for antibody access to the 
brain was observed following intranasal challenge with vesicular stomatitis virus. Our results 
reveal a previously unappreciated role of CD4 help in mobilizing antibodies to the peripheral sites 
of infection where they help to limit viral spread.
To investigate the mechanism of antibody-mediated protection within the barrier-protected 
tissues, we employed a mouse model of genital herpes infection. Herpes simplex virus type 
2 (HSV-2) enters the host through the mucosal epithelia, and infects the innervating neurons 
in the DRG to establish latency3,4. Vaginal immunization by an attenuated HSV-2 with 
deletion of the thymidine kinase gene (TK− HSV-2) provides complete protection from 
lethal disease following genital challenge with wild type HSV-2 (Ref.5) by establishing 
tissue-resident memory T cells (TRM)6. In vaginally immunized mice, IFN-γ-secretion by 
CD4 T cells, but not antibodies, are required for protection7,8. In contrast, distal 
immunization with the same virus fails to establish TRM and provides only partial

 protection6. Nevertheless, of the distal immunization routes tested, intranasal immunization 
with TK− HSV-2 provided the most robust protection against intravaginal challenge with 
WT HSV-2, whereas intraperitoneal immunization provided the least protection (Fig. 1a–
d)9,10. As shown previously6, intransal immunization did not establish TRM in the genital 
mucosa (Extended Data Fig. 1a&b), despite generating comparable circulating memory T 
cell pool (Extended Data Fig. 1c&d). Following vaginal HSV-2 challenge, mice that were 
immunized intranasally with TK− HSV-2 were unable to control viral replication within the 
vaginal mucosa (Fig. 1c), but had significantly reduced viral replication in the innervating 
neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) (Fig. 1d). Notably, we found that protection 
conferred by intranasal immunization required B cells, as JHD mice (deficient in B cells) 
were not protected by intranasal immunization (Fig. 1e–g). In the absence of B cells, 
intranasal immunization was unable to control viral replication in the DRG and spinal cord 
(Fig. 1g).
In mice immunized intranasally with TK− HSV-2, no evidence of infection in the DRG or 
the spinal cord was found (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Moreover, the intranasal route of 
immunization was not unique in conferring protective response, as parabiotic mice sharing 
circulation with intravaginally immunized partners were also partially protected from 
vaginal challenge with WT HSV-2 in the absence of TRM6 (Extended Data Fig. 1f–h). We 
found that the B cells in the immunized partners were required to confer protection in the 
naïve conjoined mice, as partners of immunized µMT mice were unprotected (Extended 
Data Fig. 1f–h). Moreover, antigen-specific B cells were required to confer protection, as 
ivag immunized partner whose B cells bearing an irrelevant B cell receptor (against hen egg 
lysozyme (HEL)) were unable to confer protection in the conjoined naïve partner (Extended 
Data Fig. 1f–h). As observed for the intranasal immunization, viral control conferred by the 
immunized parabiotic partner was not observed in the vaginal mucosa (Extended Data Fig. 
1h), suggesting that protection occurs in the innervating neurons.
Next, we investigated the basis for superior protection by antibodies following different 
routes of immunization. Intravaginal, intranasal and intraperitoneal routes of immunization 
with TK− HSV-2 results in comparable circulating CD4 T cell memory responses6. While no 
differences were seen for other isotypes, the intranasal and intravaginal routes of 
immunization were superior to intraperitoneal route in generating higher levels of systemic 
HSV-2-specific IgG2b and IgG2c responses (Extended Data Fig. 2). These results indicated 
that higher levels of circulating virus-specific IgG2b and IgG2c correlate with protection 
against vaginal HSV-2 challenge.
We next examined how antibody access to the DRG and spinal cord is mediated. Even 
though the peripheral nervous tissues are protected from antibody diffusion through blood 
nerve barrier, it was formally possible that secretion of antibody into the tissue occurs 
through transport of serum antibody by FcRn11 expressed on the endothelial cells within the 
infected tissues. However, we found that mice deficient in FcRn immunized intranasally 
with TK− HSV-2 were equally protected as the WT counterpart from vaginal HSV-2 
infection (Fig. 2a,b). Thus, circulating HSV-2-specific antibodies are somehow mobilized to 
the neuronal tissues following local viral infection in FcRn-independent manner, and are 
required for protection of the host.

 If circulating antibodies are sufficient, passive transfer of HSV-2-specific antibodies alone 
should be able to protect the host. However, we and others12,13 have found that intravenous 
injection of HSV-2-specific antibodies alone fails to protect naïve mice against HSV-2 
challenge (Fig. 2c,d). In contrast, consistent with a previous study13, we found that B cell 
deficient µMT mice immunized intranasally with TK− HSV-2 given systemic administration 
of HSV-2 specific antiserum were protected (Fig. 2c,d). Thus, these results demonstrated 
that it is the secreted antibodies, and not B cells themselves, in concert with non-B cell 
immune cells, likely T cells induced by immunization, appear to be required for protection. 
To test this possibility, we depleted CD4 T cells from mice previously immunized 
intranasally just prior to ivag HSV-2 challenge. In this setting, differentiation of B cells and 
antibody responses were allowed to occur fully in the presence of CD4 T cell help for six 
weeks. Mice acutely depleted of CD4 T cells succumbed to infection with HSV-2 (Fig. 2e,f), 
whereas depletion of CD8 T cells and NK cells had no effect9. Moreover, neutralization of 
IFN-γ prior to challenge, or genetic deficiency in IFN-γR also rendered intranasally 
immunized mice more susceptible to ivag HSV-2 challenge (Fig. 2e,f). Of note, depletion of 
CD4 T cells from i.n. immunized mice just before the viral challenge rendered mice 
incapable of viral control in the DRG, to the extent similar to the immunized B-cell deficient 
µMT mice (Fig. 2g). We observed that i.n. immunization conferred near complete protection 
from HSV-2 in the DRG but variable protection in the spinal cord (Fig. 1d, 2g). Because 
HSV-2 can differentially seed the DRG and spinal cord through sensory neurons and 
autonomic neurons14, these data suggest that the efficacy of antibody-mediated protection 
may depend on the route of viral entry. Further, these results indicate that circulating 
antibodies, CD4 T cells, and IFN-γ collectively mediate neuroprotection against HSV-2.
Given that antibody-mediated protection occurs at the level of the innervating neurons and 
not within the vagina (Figs. 1c and Extended Data Fig. 1h), we hypothesized that CD4 T 
cells might control delivery of antibodies to the tissue parenchyma through secretion of IFN-
γ. We detected only low levels of virus-specific and total antibodies in the DRG or spinal 
cord at steady state in immunized mice (Fig. 3; WT/i.n.→ D0), and undetectable levels of 
antibodies in these tissues in previously unimmunized mice six days after an acute infection 
with HSV-2 (Fig. 3; WT/Naïve → D6). However, in mice immunized intranasally with TK− 
HSV-2 six weeks earlier, increase in the levels of antibodies was detected six days post ivag 
HSV-2 challenge within the DRG and in the spinal cord (Fig. 3; WT/i.n. → D6). Moreover, 
CD4 T cells were required for access of virus-specific antibodies to the restricted tissue such 
as the DRG, as depletion of CD4 T cells completely diminished antibody levels in this tissue 
and spinal cord (Fig. 3d; WT/i.n. + anti-CD4 → D6). Further, similar requirement for CD4 T 
cells (Fig. 3b,d) and IFN-γ (Extended Data Fig. 3) was found for diffusion of total IgG2b 
and IgG2c isotypes into the DRG, indicating that the delivery mechanism does not 
discriminate virus-specificity of the antibodies. In contrast to the neuronal tissues, acute 
depletion of CD4 or IFN-γ blockade once antibody responses are established had no 
significant impact on the serum levels of anti-HSV-2 or total antibodies (Extended Data Fig. 
4a,b). To examine whether antigen-specific memory CD4 T cells was required to mediate 
antibody access to the neuronal tissues, mice were primed intranasally with a heterologous 
virus, influenza A virus, and four weeks later, were challenged with HSV-2 intravaginally. In 
contrast to mice harboring cognate memory CD4 T cells, antibody access to neuronal tissues

 following ivag HSV-2 challenge was not observed in mice that have irrelevant memory CD4 
T cells (against influenza A virus) (Extended Data Fig. 5). These data indicate that antigen-
specific memory CD4 T cells are required for antibody access to the neuronal tissues.
We hypothesized that memory CD4 T cell might enter the barrier-protected tissues and 
mobilize antibody access through local secretion of IFN-γ. In support of this idea, we found 
that IFN-γ-secreting HSV-2-specific CD4 T cells entered the DRG and spinal cord around 6 
days post genital HSV-2 challenge in mice that received intranasal immunization six weeks 
prior (Fig. 4a,b; WT/i.n. → D6). Some increase in innate leukocytes bearing CD11b, Ly6G 
or MHCII was observed in DRG and spinal cord 6 days post challenge (Extended Data Fig. 
6a). IFN-γ secretion was confined to the memory CD4 T cell population within the DRG 
(Fig. 4a). Moreover, entry of effector CD4 T cells to the DRG and spinal cord at 6 days post 
primary vaginal HSV-2 infection was much less efficient than their memory counterpart 
(Fig. 4a,b; WT/Naïve → D6), suggesting T cell intrinsic ability to migrate into these 
neuronal tissues enhance with memory development.
Interaction of α4β1 (or VLA4) and VCAM-1 contributes to T cell recruitment across the 
blood brain barrier15. Memory CD4 T cells generated against HSV-2 expresses CD49d 
which is the integrin α4 subunit6. We found that the entry of memory CD4 T cells into the 
nervous tissue was strictly dependent on α4 integrin, as antibody blockade of α4 prevented 
their entry into the DRG and spinal cord (Fig. 4a,b). We observed expression of ligand for 
α4β1, VCAM-1, in the endothelium of DRG and spinal cord in immune challenged mice 
(Fig. 4c & Extended Data Fig. 6b). Further, analysis of tissue sections revealed that the CD4 
T cells were found in the parenchyma of the DRG and spinal cord, as well as within their 
epineurium and meninges, but not within the vasculature (Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 6a,b). 
Notably, many CD4 T cells were found adjacent to the cell body of neurons within the DRG. 
Some VCAM-1 staining was found in the cytosol of neuronal cell bodies (arrowhead Fig. 
4c). Additionally, intravascular staining16 with antibody to CD90.2 revealed that vast 
majority of the CD4 T cells in the DRG and spinal cord are sequestered from circulation 
(Extended Data Fig. 7a,b). Thus, CD4 T cells recruited to the neuronal tissues access the 
parenchyma of the DRG and spinal cord. Notably, α4 integrin blockade of CD4 T cell 
recruitment resulted in diminished access of virus-specific antibody to the DRG and spinal 
cord (Fig. 4d&e), with no effect on blood levels of virus-specific antibody (Extended Data 
Fig. 4c) or the total antibody levels of various isotypes in circulation (Extended Data Fig. 
4d). Collectively, these data indicate that memory CD4 T cells enter into the neuronal tissue 
and secrete IFN-γ to promote antibody access to the DRG and spinal cord.
How might IFN-γ secreted by CD4 T cells enable circulating antibody access to the 
neuronal tissues? It is well known that IFN-γ acts on the endothelial cells to remodel tight 
junctions and increase permeability17. We observed that recombinant IFN-γ injected 
intravaginally was sufficient to enable antibody access to the vaginal lumen, suggesting that 
IFN-γ is sufficient to induce both vascular permeability and epithelial permeability in 
peripheral tissues (Extended Data Fig. 8a) and to enhance VCAM-1 expression on 
endothelial cells (Extended Data Fig. 8b). To assess whether antibody access to the neuronal 
tissues mediated by CD4 T cells and IFN-γ is through increase in vascular permeability, we 
measured release of blood albumin into the neuronal tissue following genital HSV-2

 challenge in intranasally immunized mice. Notably, we observed that vascular permeability 
occurred in the DRG and the spinal cord in CD4 T cell- and IFN-γ-dependent manner, as 
measured by leakage of blood albumin to the neuronal tissues by ELISA and 
immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 4f & Extended Fig. 9a). We confirmed CD4-dependent 
vascular permeability to the DRG and the spinal cord using intravenous injection of 70 kDa 
FITC-dextran, which has a similar size to IgG (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Collectively, our 
results support the notion that CD4 T cells enable antibody delivery to the sites of infection 
by secreting IFN-γ and enhancing microvascular permeability. This mechanism of antibody 
delivery is crucial for host immune protection, as depletion of CD4 T cells, inhibition of 
CD4 T cell migration into the neuronal tissues, or neutralization of IFN-γ renders immune 
mice susceptible to infection.
To determine whether our findings extend beyond HSV-2, we examined antibody access to 
the neuronal tissue following a different neurotropic virus, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), 
a negative sense RNA virus of the Rhabdoviridae family. Upon i.n. inoculation, VSV infects 
olfactory sensory neurons in the nasal mucosa and enters the CNS through the olfactory 
bulb18. In contrast, i.v. infection with VSV is well tolerated, and generates robust T and B 
cell responses (Extended Fig. 10)19. To determine whether antibody access to the brain 
requires memory CD4 T cells, we immunized mice with VSV intravenously. Five weeks 
later, immunized mice were challenged with VSV intranasally. Entry of VSV-specific 
antibodies was monitored in the brain six days after intranasal challenge. Consistent with the 
data obtained from HSV-2 infection, we observed a striking dependence on CD4 T cells of 
antibody access to the brain (Extended Fig. 10b). Further, anti-α4 Ab treatment of mice 
immediately prior to intranasal VSV challenge also diminished antibody access to the brain, 
without impacting VSV-specific antibodies in circulation (Extended Fig. 10c). Furthermore, 
we observed that vascular permeability to the brain was dependent on α4 integrin, as 
antibody blockade of α4 integrin resulted in diminished albumin leakage to the brain 
(Extended Fig. 10d). Taken together, these results indicate that the requirement for α4-
integrin and memory CD4 T cells for antibody access applies to two distinct neurotropic 
viruses, HSV-2 and VSV, and suggest a general mechanism of antibody access to the 
immunopriviledged tissues protected by the blood nerve barriers.
We have demonstrated a role of CD4 T cells in controlling antibody access to neuronal 
tissues through local migration and secretion of IFN-γ. Circulating CD4 memory T cells 
effectively target antibody delivery to the sites of infection through their secretion of IFN-γ, 
presumably upon recognition of cognate antigenic peptides presented by local antigen 
presenting cells23,20. These results indicate the requirement for CD4 T cell help at the 
effector phase of the antibody response, and add to the growing appreciation of CD4 T cells 
in paving the way to other effector cell types such as CD8 T cells21–23. We believe that the 
requirement for CD4 T cells for antibody access in neuronal tissue reflects an additional 
layer of control imposed by the immunopriviledged sites. In accessible tissues, inflammatory 
leukocytes can migrate to and in response to PAMPs secrete cytokines such as TNF-α that is 
sufficient to trigger vascular permeability independently of CD4 T cells. However, after 
neurotropic viral infections, the infected neurons are expected to be poor at producing 
inflammatory cytokines that remodel vascular tight junctions. At the same time, recruitment 
of innate leukocytes is blocked by shut down of specific chemokines in the ganglia of

 HSV-1-infected mice24. Curiously, expression of T cell-trophic chemokines, CXCL9 and 
CXCL10, were preserved in the DRG of infected mice24, suggesting that access by 
lymphocytes is permitted. Thus, in neuronal tissues, the entry of viral specific CD4 T cells is 
crucial to provide cytokines that permit antibodies through the induction of vascular 
permeability.
On the other hand, aberrant entry and activation of CD4 T cells predispose 
immunopriviledged tissues for access to autoantibodies and tissue damage25,26. Thus, this 
mode of targeted release of circulating antibodies not only provides a rapid and efficient 
mechanism of pathogen control, but may also restrict antibody release to irrelevant sites to 
limit immunopathology. Our results implicate that antibody-based vaccines or treatment 
against neurotropic viruses would benefit from generating robust circulating CD4 T memory 
responses. Conversely, treatment of autoantibody mediated neuropathies including chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and Guillain–Barré syndrome might benefit 
from preventing the accessibility of autoantibodies to target neurons enabled by CD4 T cells.
 Methods
 Mice
Six to eight-week old female C57BL/6 (CD45.2+) and congenic C57BL6 B6.SJL-
PtprcaPep3b/BoyJ (B6.Ly5.1) (CD45.1+) mice, B6.129S2-IghtmICgn/J (µMT) mice, anti-
HEL B-cell receptor (BCR)-transgenic C57BL/6-TgN (IghelMD4) (HELTg) mice, 
CBy.PL(B6)-Thy1a/ScrJ (Thy1.1+ Balb/c) mice and B6.129X1-Fcgrttm1Dcr/DcrJ (FcRn−/−) 
mice were purchased from the National Cancer Institute and Jackson Laboratory. JHD mice 
(B-cell deficient on Balb/c background) were obtained from Taconic Animal Models. All 
procedures used in this study complied with federal guidelines and institutional policies by 
the Yale animal care and use committee.
 Viruses
HSV-2 strains 186syn− TK− and 186syn+ were generous gifts of Dr. David Knipe (Harvard 
Medical School, Boston, MA). These viruses were propagated and titered on Vero cells 
(ATCC CCL-81) as previously described20. Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/3/334 (A/PR8: 
H1N1) and WT/VSV was propagated as previously described20,27.
 Virus infection
Six- to eight-week-old female mice injected s.c. with Depo Provera (Pharmacia Upjohn, 2 
mg per mouse) were immunized intravaginally, intraperitoneally or intranasally with 105 
PFU of HSV-2 (186syn− TK−) as previously described6. For secondary challenge, 
immunized mice were challenged vaginally with 104 pfu of WT HSV-2 (186syn+) (100% 
lethal dose for naïve mice). In the case of Balb/c and JHD mice, these mice were immunized 
with 5 × 104 to 105 PFU of HSV-2. For secondary challenge, immunized mice were 
challenged with 105 pfu of WT HSV-2 (100% lethal dose for naïve mice). The severity of 
disease was scored as ; 0, no sign; 1, slight genital erythema and edema; 2, moderate genital 
inflammation; 3, purulent genital lesions; 4, hind-limb paralysis; 5, pre-moribund20. Due to 
humane concerns, the animals were euthanized prior to reaching moribund state. To measure

 virus titer in peripheral tissues, vaginal tissues, dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord were 
harvested in ABC buffer (0.5 mM MgCl26H2O, 0.9 mM CaCl22H2O, 1% glucose, 5% HI 
FBS and penicillin-streptomycin) including 1% amphotericin-B (Sigma). Thereafter, these 
tissues were homogenized by lysing matrix D (MP Biomedicals), followed by clarifying by 
centrifugation. Viral titers were obtained by titration of tissue samples on Vero cell 
monolayer. Protein concentration in tissue homogenates was measured by DC™ protein 
assay kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.). C57/BL6 mice were immunized i.v. with WT/VSV (2 
× 106 pfu/mouse) or i.n. with influenza A/PR8 (10 pfu/mouse). For secondary challenge, 
VSV-immunized mice were re-infected i.n. with WT/VSV (1 × 107 pfu/mouse).
 Antibodies
Anti-CD90.2 (30-H12), anti-CD90.1 (OX-7), anti-CD45.2 (104), anti-CD45.1 (A20), anti-
CD4 (GK1.5, RM4-5 and RM4-4), anti-CD19 (6D5), anti-CD45R/B220 (RA3-6B2), anti-
MHC class II (I-A/I-E, M5/114.15.2), anti-CD69 (H1.2F3), anti-CD44 (IM7), anti-CD49d 
(R1-2), anti-NKp46 (29A1.4), anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2 and R4-6A2) were purchased from e-
Bioscience or Biolegend.
 Isolation of leukocytes from peripheral tissues
The genital tracts of vaginal tissues treated with Depo-Provera were dissected from the 
urethra and cervix. Prior to collection of neuronal tissues, mice were perfused extensively 
using transcardiac perfusion and perfusion through inferior vena cava and great saphenous 
vein with more than 30 mL of PBS. The dorsal root ganglia and the adjacent region of the 
spinal cord were harvested in PBS for flow cytometry or ABC buffer for tissue 
homogenization. The tissues in PBS were then incubated with 0.5 mg/mL Dispase II 
(Roche) for 15 min at 37 °C. Thereafter, vaginal tissues were digested with 1 mg/mL 
collagenase D (Roche) and 30 µg/mL DNase I (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 25 min. The 
resulting cells were filtered through a 70-µm filter28,29.
 Flow cytometry
Preparation of single cell suspensions from spleen, draining LNs (inguinal LN and iliac 
LNs), vagina and neuronal tissues were described previously. Multiparameter analyses were 
carried out on the LSR II flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and were analyzed using the 
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR). To detect HSV-2-speific CD4+ T cells or VSV-
specific CD4+ T cells (CD45.1+ or CD45.2+), single cell suspensions from vaginal tissues of 
TK− HSV-2 immunized mice or VSV immunized mice were stimulated in the presence of 5 
µg/ml Brefeldin A with naïve splenocytes (CD45.1+ CD45.2+) loaded with heat-inactivated 
HSV-2 antigen, heat-inactivated WT VSV and heat-inactivated influenza virus A/PR8 for 
around 12 hr6. To detect HSV-2-specific CD4+ T cells in Balb/c and JHD mice, single cell 
suspensions (CD90.2+) from vaginal tissues of TK− HSV-2 immunized mice were 
stimulated with naïve splenocytes (CD90.1+) loaded with heat-inactivated HSV-2 antigen.
 In vivo treatment with neutralizing/depleting antibodies
C57/BL6 mice or Balb/c mice were immunized with TK− HSV-2 virus. Five to eight weeks 
later, these mice were injected i.v. (tail vain) with 300 µg of anti-CD4 (GK1.5; BioXCell) or

 anti-IFN-γ (XMG1.2; BioXCell) Ab at days −4, −1, 2 and 4 after HSV-2 challenge. In vivo 
depletion for CD4 was confirmed by FACS analysis of the cell suspension from spleen. For 
the neutralization of α4-integrin, purified anti-mouse α4 integrin/CD49d (PS/2; 
SouthernBiotech) was given a tail vain injection of 300 µg Ab at days 2 and 4 after 
challenge.
 Parabiosis
Parabiosis was performed as previously described with slight modifications6. Naïve or 
immunized C57/BL6 mice, HELTg and µMT mice were anesthetized with a mixture of 
Ketamine/Xylazine (100 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg respectively). After shaving the corresponding 
lateral aspects of each mouse, matching skin incisions were made from behind the ear to hip 
and sutured together with Chromic Gut (4-0, HENRY SCHEIN, UK) absorbable suture, then 
these areas were clipped with 7-mm stainless-steel wound clips (ROBOZ).
 Measurement of virus-specific Igs and total Igs in serum and tissue homogenates
Ninety six-well EIA/RIA plate wells were filled with 100 µl of heat-inactivated purified 
HSV-2 (104 to 105 pfu equivalent per 100 µl) or heat-inactivated purified VSV (5 × 105 pfu 
equivalent per 100 µl) for virus-specific Ig measurement or goat anti-mouse Ig (1:1000; 
SouthernBiotech, 1010-01) for total Ig measurement in carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) and then 
incubated overnight at 4°C. On the following day, these plates were washed with PBS-
Tween 20 and blocked 2hr with 5% FBS in PBS. Tissue samples and serum samples in ABC 
buffer were then plated in the wells and incubate for at least four hours at ambient 
temperature. After washing in PBS-Tween 20, HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG1, IgG3, 
IgM, IgA, IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG2c (SouthernBiotech) was added in the wells for 1 h, 
followed by washing and adding TMB solution (eBioscience). Reactions were stopped with 
1N H2SO4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm. The sample Ab titers were defined by 
using Ig standard (C57BL/6 Mouse Immunoglobulin Panel; SouthernBiotech) or mouse 
IgG2a (HOPC-1; SouthernBiotech).
 Albumin ELISA
Using tissue homogenates (DRG and spinal cord) prepared after extensive perfusion, 
albumin ELISA (Genway) was performed according to instruction.
 Immunofluorescence staining
Frozen sections 8 µm in thickness were cut, fixed, left to dry at ambient temperature. These 
tissues were stained with the Abs (anti-CD4 [H129.19], anti–MHC class II [M5/114.15.2] 
anti-VCAM-1 [429/MVCAM.A], anti-CD31 [390 and MEC13.3], anti-Ly6G [1A8], anti-
CD11b [M1/70] and anti-mouse albumin [Goat pAb/BETHYL Laboratories Inc. TX]) as 
previously described6. These slides were washed and incubated with DAPI and mounted 
with Fluoromount-G (SouthernBiotech). These slides were analyzed by fluorescence 
microscopy (BX51; Olympus).

  Vascular permeability assays
Spinal column was harvested from intranasal TK− HSV-2 immunized mice 45 min after tail 
vein injection with 200 µl of 5 mg/ml Oregon Green 488-conjugated dextran (70kDa, 
D7173, Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA) in PBS. Spine was then fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight, and cut frozen sections (8 µm in thickness) for 
immunohistochemical analysis30.
 DNA isolation from tissues
C57/BL6 mice were immunized intranasally with TK− HSV-2. Six weeks later, vaginal 
tissues, DRG and spinal cord of these mice were lysed in 10 mg/ml Proteinase K (Roche) to 
isolate DNA at 55 °C overnight. After removing these tubes, phenol equilibrated with Tris 
pH 8.0 was added. Thereafter, upper aqueous phase was added to phenol/chloroform (1:1). 
The upper aqueous phase was re-suspended with sodium acetate, pH 6.0 and 100% ethanol 
at RT. After shaking and centrifuging the concentration of isolated DNA pellet was 
measured. Level of HSV-2 genoimc DNA in peripheral tissues based on HSV-2 gD (Forward 
primer: agcgaggataacctgggatt, Reverse primer: gggataaagcggggtaacat) was analyzed by 
qPCR using purified viral DNA genome as standard.
 Statistical Analysis
Survival curve was analyzed using the log-rank test. For other data, normally distributed 
continuous variable comparisons were performed using two-tailed unpaired t-test or paired t-
test using Prism software. For comparison of two nonparametric datasets, the Mann-Whitney 
U-test was used.
