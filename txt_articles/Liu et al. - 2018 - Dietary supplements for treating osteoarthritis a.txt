ABSTRACT
Objective To investigate the efficacy and safety of 
dietary supplements for patients with osteoarthritis.
Design An intervention systematic review with random 
effects meta-analysis and meta-regression.
Data sources MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Register 
of Controlled Trials, Allied and Complementary Medicine 
and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health 
Literature were searched from inception to April 2017.
Study eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials 
comparing oral supplements with placebo for hand, hip 
or knee osteoarthritis.
Results Of 20 supplements investigated in 69 eligible 
studies, 7 (collagen hydrolysate, passion fruit peel 
extract, Curcuma longa extract, Boswellia serrata extract, 
curcumin, pycnogenol and L-carnitine) demonstrated 
large (effect size >0.80) and clinically important 
effects for pain reduction at short term. Another 
six (undenatured type II collagen, avocado soybean 
unsaponifiables, methylsulfonylmethane, diacerein, 
glucosamine and chondroitin) revealed statistically 
significant improvements on pain, but were of unclear 
clinical importance. Only green-lipped mussel extract and 
undenatured type II collagen had clinically important 
effects on pain at medium term. No supplements were 
identified with clinically important effects on pain 
reduction at long term. Similar results were found for 
physical function. Chondroitin demonstrated statistically 
significant, but not clinically important structural 
improvement (effect size −0.30, –0.42 to −0.17). There 
were no differences between supplements and placebo 
for safety outcomes, except for diacerein. The Grading 
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation suggested a wide range of quality evidence 
from very low to high.
Conclusions The overall analysis including all trials 
showed that supplements provided moderate and 
clinically meaningful treatment effects on pain and 
function in patients with hand, hip or knee osteoarthritis 
at short term, although the quality of evidence was very 
low. Some supplements with a limited number of studies 
and participants suggested large treatment effects, 
while widely used supplements such as glucosamine 
and chondroitin were either ineffective or showed small 
and arguably clinically unimportant treatment effects. 
Supplements had no clinically important effects on pain 
and function at medium-term and long-term follow-ups.
InTRODuCTIOn
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of 
arthritis, affecting about 12% of the population.1 
The prevalence of OA is rising due to the ageing 
population and growing rates of obesity.2 Hip and 
knee OA was recently ranked as the 11th highest 
contributor to global disability,3 with enormous 
economic burden. Costs are estimated between 
0.25% and 0.50% of a country’s gross domestic 
product, and the mean annual incremental direct 
and indirect costs are nearly US$7000 per person 
with OA.4 
Paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) are currently endorsed by clinical 
guidelines to treat OA,5–7 but emerging evidence 
has challenged this recommendation and revealed 
the potential for adverse events.8 9 This new 
evidence could potentially increase public interest 
in the benefits of alternative treatments. Currently 
69% of patients with OA take some form of dietary 
supplements for their condition.10 They are regu-
larly used by a wide range of consumers with 
musculoskeletal ailments and often used along-
side or as an alternative to first-line interventions 
such as exercise. This has driven expenditures for 
alternative therapies to nearly equal those spent 
on traditional pharmacological therapy.11 Supple-
ments account for US$25 
billion sales annually12; 
glucosamine and chondroitin together account for 
a third of this cost,13 with annual sales amounting to 
US$872 
million.14 Although widely used by patients 
with OA, the safety and efficacy of supplements 
remain unclear and are often clouded by misinfor-
mation in mainstream media.15 16 Thus, physicians’ 
scepticism towards their efficacy can be challenged 
on this basis. Given the efforts of many to demon-
strate the effect size (ES) of other first-line treat-
ments such as exercise, it is critical that we have a 
clear understanding of the relative merits of supple-
ment use. The aim of this review was to evaluate 
efficacy and safety of supplements compared with 
placebo in people with hand, hip or knee OA.
MeThODS
The review, in accordance with the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement,17 followed 
the Cochrane Handbook18 and the updated guide-
line of the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review 
Group.19 The study protocol was registered 
on 
PROSPERO 
(https://www. 
crd. 
york. 
ac. 
uk/ 
prospero/) (CRD42015025732).
Study selection
We included peer-reviewed, published, randomised 
placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) with full-text 
articles investigating the efficacy or safety of any 
dietary supplements for participants with hand, 
hip or knee OA. We defined dietary supplements

Review
as a product taken orally intended to supplement the diet, 
which may include vitamins, minerals, herbs or other botani-
cals, amino acids, and substances.20 To be eligible for inclusion, 
trials were required to explicitly report including participants 
diagnosed with hand, hip or knee OA according to one of the 
following criteria: (1) American College of Rheumatology, (2) 
European League Against Rheumatism or (3) clinically and/or 
radiologically confirmed. Trials were required to report at least 
one of the following primary outcomes: pain or physical func-
tion. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects (AEs), radio-
graphical joint space width/narrowing, stiffness, use of analgesics 
and quality of life. We were interested in evaluating individual 
supplement, so combination therapy and herbs were excluded. 
The language was limited to English.
Data sources and searches
We carried out a systematic electronic search on MEDLINE, 
EMBASE, Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials,  Allied and 
Complementary Medicine and Cumulative Index to Nursing 
and Allied Health Literature from inception to 18 April 2017. 
Relevant keywords were used to construct the search strategy 
(with guidance from a librarian), including dietary supplements, 
nutraceuticals, OA and specific supplements (eg, glucosamine, 
chondroitin), according to previous reviews in which the supple-
ments were reported for treatment of OA21–24 (online supple-
mentary file 1, Search strategy). The reference lists of included 
studies were screened for potentially eligible trials. One reviewer 
(XL) conducted the first screening for potentially relevant 
records based on titles and abstracts. Full-text articles were 
independently assessed by two reviewers (XL and VR); disagree-
ments were resolved through consensus or by consulting a third 
reviewer (DJH).
Data extraction and quality assessment
Baseline characteristics and outcomes data were extracted on a 
standardised form by two independent assessors. Factorial trials 
were assumed as parallel-group design.25 26 Data of multiple 
groups from one study were extracted using recommendations 
of the Cochrane Handbook.18 For continuous outcomes the 
following were extracted: means, SD and sample sizes at base-
line and follow-up. If these were unavailable, change scores or 
mean differences were extracted. For dichotomous outcomes, 
the number of cases and total sample size were extracted. Safety 
outcomes included the number of participants reporting any or 
serious AEs, or withdrawn from the study because of AEs. We 
contacted authors for missing data. When authors were unavail-
able, data were estimated using the recommendations of the 
Cochrane Handbook (eg, estimation of SD from SEs).18
We predefined a follow-up period ≤3 months as short term, 
a follow-up between 4 and 6 months as medium term, and a 
follow-up period >6 months as long-term. Data at the latest time 
point were used for those studies reporting multiple follow-up 
times within an individual time point category. When studies 
reported more than one scale to measure pain or physical func-
tion, we used the list of outcomes with hierarchy levels proposed 
by the Cochrane Musculoskeletal Review Group to choose the 
most relevant outcome.27
Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using the Cochrane 
Collaboration’s tool.18 If at least one of the bias domains was 
judged at high risk, the trial was considered at high risk; if all 
bias domains were judged at low risk, the trial was considered 
at low risk; otherwise, the trial was classified unclear risk. The 
role of the pharmaceutical companies in conducting the trial was 
assessed in the ‘other’ bias domain. We used RevMan V
.5.3 to 
generate figures for the risk of bias assessment. Data extraction 
and assessment of risk of bias were performed independently 
by two reviewers (XL and VR). Disagreements were resolved 
through consensus or by a third reviewer (DJH).
Data synthesis and analysis
Data were pooled using random-effects model. As the included 
trials used different scales to assess the same outcome, stan-
dardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated for continuous 
data, and risk ratios (RR) were used for dichotomous data with 
their 95% CIs. To facilitate interpretation of estimated treatment 
effects, we considered ES up to 0.3 as small, between 0.3 and 0.8 
as moderate, and greater than 0.8 as large effects.28 A threshold 
of 0.37 standardised units was defined as the minimum clinically 
important difference (MCID), which was based on the median 
MCID found in recent studies in patients with OA.9 29 We 
considered the effects as clinically important if ES and 95% 
CI 
exceeded our prespecified MCID threshold of 0.37. The effects 
were considered unclear if clinically important when the 95% 
CI 
crossed this threshold, and statistically significant but clearly not 
clinically important when the 95% 
CI was below the MCID but 
above the null effect line. If the 95% 
CI crossed the null effect 
line, supplements were considered ineffective.
Between-trial heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic; 
values higher than 50% were considered to indicate substantial 
heterogeneity.30 In order to explore potential sources of hetero-
geneity and the influence of different factors on the estimate of 
treatment effect, a series of sensitivity analyses were conducted 
for glucosamine and chondroitin. Meta-regression was used 
to compare the difference in ES (with 95% 
CI) and generate a 
p value between subgroups for pain at short term. Subgroups 
were defined in terms of judgements for each risk of bias domain 
(low, unclear or high); sample size of trials (large n>50; small 
n≤50 per group); and different OA sites (eg, knee, hip). Statis-
tical analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Anal-
ysis V
.3 (Englewood, New Jersey, USA).
The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the quality 
of evidence for each pooled analysis according to five criteria: 
limitation of study design, publication bias, imprecision, incon-
sistency and indirectness.18 31 The quality of evidence was down-
graded by one level for limitation of study design when more 
than a quarter of the studies included in an analysis were consid-
ered at high risk of bias. Where possible, publication bias was 
assessed by visual inspection of funnel plots (scatterplot of the ES 
from individual studies against its SE) and the Egger’s test for the 
meta-analysis with 10 or more trials.32 The rating was down-
graded by one level if two-tailed p<0.1. Results were considered 
inconsistent if the heterogeneity between trials was substantial 
(I2>50%),33 and imprecise if the pooled sample size was <300 
for dichotomous or <400 for continuous outcomes.34 The indi-
rectness criterion was not considered as this review concerned a 
specific population, relevant outcomes and direct comparisons. 
GRADE ratings were defined as very low, low, moderate or high 
quality evidence reflecting the extent to which we are confident 
that an effect estimate is correct.

Review
(figure 1).35–37 Glucosamine (n=18 trials) and chondroitin 
(n=14 trials) were the most frequently investigated supple-
ments, whereas eight supplements were investigated by only 
one trial. Fifty-eight of the 69 included trials (84%) investi-
gated knee, five (7%) studied hip and knee, four (6%) assessed 
hip and two (3%) included hand OA. Sixty-seven of the 69 
included trials (96%) were parallel-group along with two 
factorial trials (online supplementary file 1, Baseline charac-
teristics). Sixty-six trials were included in the meta-analyses. 
Among three trials excluded from the analysis, one reported 
mean outcome values without dispersion measures; imputation 
of missing values was impossible,38 one was a discontinuation 
study,39 and another reported data using percentages and 
lacked baseline scores for the placebo group.40
Across trials, the mean age of participants ranged from 48 to 69 
years, and the mean proportion of women was 65%. The treat-
ment and follow-up duration ranged from 2 
weeks to 3 
years. 
Forty-four of the 69 included trials reported short-term outcomes 
(64%), 17 trials (25%) reported medium-term outcomes, and 17 
trials (25%) reported long-term outcomes. A variety of propri-
etary products of supplements and different dosages were evalu-
ated. Where supplements were judged similar (eg, curcumin and 
curcuminoid) or the same supplement was investigated using 
different preparations (eg, glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine

hydrochloride) or different dosages, we combined data according 
to recommendations from the Cochrane Handbook.
Overall, only 7 of the 69 included trials (10%) were judged 
at low risk of bias, 32 (46%) at high and 30 (44%) at unclear 
risk. The major potential source of bias was in the ‘other’ bias 
domain. Forty-four of the 69 included trials (64%) were funded 
by pharmaceutical companies. T
wenty-six of the 44 pharmaceu-
tically funded trials (59%) were judged at high risk of bias due to 
conflicts of interest (eg, employee/s was/were authors, or compa-
nies played an important role in conducting the trial). Incom-
plete outcome data and selective outcome reporting were other 
potential sources of bias in 17% and 6% of the 69 included trials, 
respectively. Online supplementary file 1  provides a graphical 
summary of the results of risk of bias for the 69 studies.
Primary analyses
Our pooled analysis suggested a moderate effect of supple-
ments in reducing pain at short term (SMD −0.53, 95% 
CI 
−0.61 to −0.46, I2 78%) with very low-quality evidence. Seven 
supplements (L-carnitine, pycnogenol, curcumin, Boswellia 
serrata extract, Curcuma longa extract, passion fruit peel 
extract and collagen hydrolysate) showed large and clinically 
important effects for pain reductions at short term (figure 2). 
However, most of the studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical

companies and the research evidence was limited in the number 
of studies and participants included. Only one study was 
included for L-carnitine, Curcuma longa extract, passion fruit 
peel extract and collagen hydrolysate. Another six (avocado 
soybean unsaponifiables, undenatured type II collagen, meth-
ylsulfonylmethane (MSM), diacerein, glucosamine and chon-
droitin) revealed statistically significant improvements on pain 
at short term, but were of unclear clinical importance. The 
remaining five (vitamin E, bromelain, willow bark extract, Arte-
misia annua extract, green-lipped mussel extract) were inef-
fective in reducing pain compared with placebo at short term. 
However, green-lipped mussel extract and undenatured type II 
collagen demonstrated clinically important effects for pain reduc-
tion among eight supplements investigated at medium term. At 
long-term follow-up, none of the included supplements showed 
clinically important effects compared with placebo. The GRADE 
ratings ranged from very low-quality to high-quality evidence 
(online supplementary file 1).
Overall, there was very low-quality evidence of moderate 
physical function improvements provided by supplements at 
short term (SMD −0.53, 95% 
CI −0.62 to −0.45, I2 80%). We 
found that seven supplements (pycnogenol, passion fruit peel 
extract, Curcuma longa extract, L-carnitine, Boswellia serrata 
extract, curcumin and MSM) had large and clinically important 
effects on physical function at short term (figure 3). However, 
only one study was included for passion fruit peel extract, 
Curcuma longa extract, L-carnitine and curcumin. The research 
evidence is limited. Five supplements (undenatured type II 
collagen, avocado/soybean unsaponifiables (ASU), glucosamine, 
chondroitin and diacerein) demonstrated effects that were of 
unclear clinical importance, although these were statistically 
significant. Another four (vitamin E, bromelain, willow bark

extract, Artemisia annua extract) were ineffective in improving 
physical function for OA at short term. At medium and long term, 
none of the included supplements revealed clinically important 
effects, with most being ineffective compared with placebo. The 
GRADE evaluation ranged from very low-quality to high-quality 
evidence (online supplementary file 1).
Pooled results suggested that five supplements (Boswellia 
serrata extract, L-carnitine, MSM, undenatured type II collagen 
and pycnogenol) revealed statistically significant improvements 
on stiffness at short term; however, only Boswellia serrata 
extract reached clinical importance (SMD −0.94, 95% 
CI −1.26 
to −0.62, I2 0). No evidence existed to support any supplements 
improved stiffness at medium and long term. The GRADE 
ratings ranged from very low-quality to high-quality evidence 
(online supplementary file 1).
For the supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin, ASU, diace-
rein and vitamin D) included in studies of long-term struc-
tural improvement, only chondroitin demonstrated statistically 
significant difference (SMD −0.30, 95% 
CI −0.42 to −0.17, 
I2 5) when compared with placebo, but it did not reach clini-
cally important effects. GRADE ratings were moderate to high 
(online supplementary file 1).
Limited evidence suggested that glucosamine, ASU and 
pycnogenol probably reduced the use of NSAIDs. Only Curcuma 
longa extract demonstrated statistically significant differences in 
analgesic use (RR 0.5, 95% 
CI 0.3 to 0.8). No significant differ-
ences in quality of life were demonstrated in five investigated 
supplements (glucosamine, chondroitin, MSM, vitamin E and 
willow bark extract) (online supplementary file 1).
For the safety analyses, we included 34 trials with 5271 
participants including 12 supplements with regard to any 
adverse event (figure 4). No statistically significant difference 
between supplements and placebo was found (RR 1.0, 95% CI 
1.0 to 1.1), except for diacerein (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6) 
deriving from five trials with 1300 participants. Similarly, 34 
trials with 8111 participants including 8 supplements revealed 
no difference in the number of dropouts due to adverse events 
(RR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.4) and again except for diacerein 
(RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.3) deriving from 5 trials with 1360 
participants. Only 9 trials with 2494 participants including 
6 supplements reported serious adverse events data and there 
was no difference between groups (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.6). 
The GRADE ratings ranged from low-quality to high-quality 
evidence (online supplementary file 1).
Inspection of the funnel plots (online supplementary file 
2) suggested small study effects/publication bias for overall 
results in terms of pain and physical function at short and 
medium term. Similar results were found for glucosamine in 
terms of pain and physical function at short term. Egger’s test 
reached statistical significance (p<0.10).
Sensitivity analyses
For glucosamine (n=10 trials, table 1), trials judged at unclear 
risk of incomplete outcome (ES difference −1.0, 95% CI −1.5 
to −0.4; p=0.001) or high risk of selective reporting bias (ES 
difference −0.9, 95% CI −1.5 to −0.4; p=0.001) revealed 
significantly larger treatment effects compared with those at 
low or unclear risk. Moreover, trials judged at unclear risk 
of allocation concealment suggested larger treatment effects 
compared with those at low risk; however, the difference was 
not statistically significant (ES difference −0.4, 95% CI −0.9 
to 0.0; p=0.06). Industry-sponsored trials with conflicts of 
interest (high risk of ‘other’ bias) demonstrated larger effects 
than unfunded trials or trials without conflicts of interest (ES 
difference −1.4, 95% CI −2.4 to −0.4; p=0.005). Smaller 
trials reported larger beneficial effects compared with large 
trials (ES difference −0.5, 95% CI −0.9 to −0.2; p=0.003).
For chondroitin (n=9, table 2), trials with low risk of 
selection bias revealed smaller treatment effects than those 
judged at unclear risk (ES difference −0.4, 95% CI −0.6 
to −0.1; p=0.005). Trials judged at unclear risk of alloca-
tion concealment or incomplete outcome suggested larger 
treatment effects compared with those at low risk, but

the difference was not statistically significant (p=0.11 and

Review
DISCuSSIOn
We conducted a comprehensive systematic review on efficacy and 
safety of various dietary supplements for hand, hip or knee OA 
including 69 RCTs (11 
586 participants) and 20 supplements, 
the majority of which evaluated glucosamine and chondroitin. 
Our review demonstrates that the most widely used supplements 
(eg, glucosamine and chondroitin) are not clinically effective 
in reducing pain and improving physical function at short term 
in patients with OA. There were a number of supplements (eg, 
Boswellia serrata extract, pycnogenol, curcumin) with limited 
studies and participants that were sponsored by pharmaceutical 
companies that did report moderate to large effects of clinical 
importance on pain reduction and disability improvement at short 
term. No data of these supplements on efficacy outcome at medi-
um-term and long-term follow-up were provided by the included 
trials. No supplements demonstrated clinically important effects 
for pain at medium term and long term except for green-lipped 
mussel extract and undenatured type II collagen, which suggested 
clinically meaningful effects on pain reduction at medium term. 
Regarding long-term effects on structural improvement among 
included studies, our review reveals that chondroitin demon-
strated small but statistically significant effects when compared 
with placebo, although with doubtful clinical importance. Overall, 
our review suggested that with the exception of diacerein, dietary 
supplements were safe to use.
The strengths of our review include the following: PRISMA 
recommendations were adhered to, the review was prospectively 
registered and the GRADE approach was used to appraise the 
quality of the evidence. We identified a larger number of supple-
ments reported for treating patients with OA than previous 
reviews,21–24 which were limited as narrative reviews and did 
not perform a meta-analysis. Other reviews29 41–47 only focused 
on a particular supplement. We included fewer trials of some 
supplements (eg, chondroitin, glucosamine, diacerein) because 
we only included RCTs and excluded combination therapy. We 
included trials of single supplements because they provided the 
best evidence on the efficacy of specific pharmacological treat-
ments.48 Different proprietary products of supplements were 
evaluated in the included studies. We only combined those 
supplements that had very similar chemical components or 
different preparations or dosages of same chemicals.
Including more supplements with pooled treatment effects 
enabled us to provide thorough and valuable information for 
physicians and/or sports and exercise medicine practitioners to 
choose suitable supplements within their practice. Further, we 
pooled analysis for each supplement in categories of different 
time points as there was a wide range of follow-up durations from 
2 
weeks to 3 
years. To facilitate the interpretation of our results, 
we have provided clinically interpretable estimates on SMD,9 29 
and compared our ES with a predetermined smallest worthwhile 
effect, which reflects the smallest effect of the intervention on 
outcomes compared with placebo that patients would consider 
meaningful or important. Moreover, we performed sensitivity 
analyses for glucosamine and chondroitin to examine the impact 
of moderator variables that could have influenced our effect esti-
mates, such as risk of bias judgements, sample size and different 
OA sites by using meta-regression method, and found that small 
sample size and commercial funding are the main factors that 
influenced the results, which further contributes to the robustness 
of our results. However, we are limited by the methodological 
approach of a standard meta-analysis in which we only compare 
each of the supplements with placebo; a network meta-analysis 
might be needed in future to provide a single, coherent ranking of 
supplements by performing direct and indirect comparisons that 
allow an individual ranking of each supplement against each other, 
to determine which is the optimal supplement.
A potential limitation is that we limited the language to 
English, which could introduce bias. Another limitation is that 
most of the data pertain to knee OA, which may limit the gener-
alisability to other types of OA. The dosage of supplements was 
not considered to enable the inclusion of more available trials 
for each supplement, and we did not consider patient adher-
ence mostly because few studies reported relevant data. The 
number of studies in each meta-analysis was relatively small for 
most supplements (only one trial available for eight of them) 
and long-term data were often unavailable. Nearly 50% of the 
included trials were at high risk according to the Cochrane risk 
of bias tool, which highlighted a number of limitations including 
incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, inade-
quate description or inappropriate method of randomisation, 
allocation concealment and blinding. Further, many included 
studies were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that often 
played important roles in some stages of the trial. Importantly, 
we should be very cautious to explain the GRADE ratings 
for the treatment effect estimates of single trial (eg, passion 
fruit peel extract for pain at short term, ES −1.65, GRADE 
ratings: moderate) because further research is very likely to have 
an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect 
and is likely to change the estimate.
We provided funnel plots for those outcomes with more than 
10 studies. The plots clearly show that small study effects/publi-
cation bias is likely for the overall analysis, and glucosamine trials 
in particular, which probably inflates the estimate of efficacy 
reported. From this point, those supplements with large ES might 
represent publication bias as well. Furthermore, over two-thirds 
of the supplements were studied at short term (≤3 months); only 
one-third of them were studied at medium and long term. We are 
unsure whether those supplements with large effects at short term 
would have equivalent efficacy and safety in the long term.
unanswered questions and future research
Further large and robust RCTs with longer treatment duration 
are needed to confirm efficacy of supplements with large treat-
ment effects at short term in the presence of limited study quality 
evidence (passion fruit peel extract, Curcuma longa extract, 
Boswellia serrata extract, curcumin, pycnogenol and L-carnitine). 
It is especially important to further evaluate safety of these supple-
ments in the long run. Further placebo-controlled trials are required 
to evaluate efficacy of widely used fish oil; we were unable to iden-
tify RCTs satisfying the inclusion criteria. Future studies should use 
appropriate methods to avoid bias in terms of randomisation, allo-
cation concealment, handling dropout rate and avoiding selective 
outcome reporting. More studies are needed to investigate efficacy 
and safety of supplements for hand OA. Conflicts of interest had 
an important influence on the results; future sponsors should avoid 
playing roles in any stage of any trial.
In summary, supplements are generally safe to use for treating 
OA. Compared with placebo, the overall analysis including all trials 
showed that supplements provided moderate and clinical mean-
ingful treatment effects on pain and function in patients with hip, 
knee and hip OA at short term, although the quality of evidence 
was very low. The most widely used supplements (eg, glucos-
amine, chondroitin) do not provide a clinically important effect 
on knee, hip or hand OA. Some little-known supplements (eg, 
Boswellia serrata extract, pycnogenol, curcumin) appear to have 
larger effects in the short term, although current data are of low

Review
quality. However, please note that larger effects were seen mostly 
for supplements that had only one or a few studies and a small 
number of participants; further research is likely to change the 
results. Supplements with more numerous triand larger numbers 
of participants were more likely to have small or non-significant 
effects. Supplements have no demonstrable clinical effect on pain 
and function at medium-term and long-term follow-ups.
At this stage, we are unable to recommend the use of diace-
rein, vitamin D, glucosamine and chondroitin for patients with 
OA based on the evidence that they do not appear to provide a 
clinically meaningful benefit. However it is important to note 
whatever placebo effects may come from use of these supple-
ments. It is worth considering trying Boswellia serrata extract, 
curcumin or pycnogenol with caution over a short period of time 
(eg, 4–6 
weeks) especially for those patients who are very enthu-
siastic about taking complementary and alternative therapies.
