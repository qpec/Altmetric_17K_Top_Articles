Purpose
Depression symptoms are common among patients with lung cancer; however, longitudinal
changes and their impact on survival are understudied.
Methods
This was a prospective, observational study from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Sur-
veillance Consortium from five US geographically defined regions from September 2003 through
December 2005. Patients enrolled within 3 months of their lung cancer diagnosis were eligible. The
eight-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale was administered at diagnosis and
12 months’ follow-up. The main outcome was survival, which was evaluated using Kaplan-Meyer
curves and adjusted Cox proportional hazards modeling.
Results
Among 1,790 participants, 681 (38%) had depression symptoms at baseline and an additional 105 (14%)
developed new-onset depression symptoms during treatment. At baseline, depression symptoms were
associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.32; P = .01). Participants
were classified into the following four groups based on longitudinal changes in depression symptoms
from baseline to follow-up: never depression symptoms (n = 640), new-onset depression symptoms
(n = 105), depression symptom remission (n = 156), and persistent depression symptoms (n = 254) and
HRs were calculated. Using the never-depression symptoms group as a reference group, HRs were as
follows: new-onset depression symptoms, 1.50 (95% CI, 1.12 to 2.01; P = .006); depression symptom
remission, 1.02 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.31; P = .89), and persistent depression symptoms, 1.42 (95% CI, 1.15
to 1.75; P = .001). At baseline, depression symptoms were associated with increased mortality among
participants with early-stage disease (stages I and II; HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.26 to 2.04), but not late-stage
disease (stages III and IV; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.22). At follow-up, depression symptoms were
associated with increased mortality among participants with early-stage disease (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.27
to 2.31) and those with late-stage disease (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.69).
Conclusion
Among patients with lung cancer, longitudinal changes in depression symptoms are associated with
differences in mortality, particularly among patients with early-stage disease. Symptom remission is
associated with a similar mortality rate as never having had depression.

INTRODUCTION
A life-threatening diagnosis such as cancer
evokes distress in many patients and may
result in depression symptoms or clinical
depression.1,2 Additional stressors contrib-
ute, including the effects of chemotherapeutic
agents, surgical procedures, radiotherapy, and
the consequences of physical symptoms and
paraneoplastic syndromes. Rates of depression
vary by diagnostic criteria, but among patients
with lung cancer, the prevalence of major de-
pressive disorder ranges from 5% to 13%,
whereas up to 44% of patients with lung cancer
may experience depression symptoms. Both
estimates are consistently higher than those
associated with other cancers types.3-6

 Among patients with cancer, more severe and persistent
depression symptoms are associated with prolonged hospital stays,
worse treatment adherence, lower quality of life (QOL), physical
distress and pain, and increased desire for hastened death.7-9
Depression may amplify physical symptoms and interfere with
effective coping during treatment.10,11 Most important, depression
present at cancer diagnosis is associated with increased mortality
among patients with lung cancer.12-15
Recognizing the negative consequences of psychological
distress, professional oncologic societies have begun developing
guidelines regarding the assessments and care of patients with
cancer who are experiencing distress.9,16,17 Guidelines include
periodic assessments across the trajectory of cancer care, and
institutional and community resources for treatment. Integrated
multicomponent, collaborative depression care is effective and
improves QOL and role functioning in patients with cancer.18
Treating depression symptoms is recommended to improve
QOL among patients with cancer.16 If decreased depression
symptoms are associated with improved mortality as well, de-
pression care may need to be considered as important as other
adjuvant oncologic therapies. In addition, the high prevalence of
persistent depression symptoms in patients with lung cancer
during treatment affirms the need to better understand its impact
on outcomes.19,20 In other cancer populations without lung cancer,
outcomes have been inconsistent. Among patients with breast
cancer, health-related QOL and psychological distress at follow-up
had no impact on survival.21 In a mixed group of patients with
cancer
who were assessed
during
survivorship, depression
symptoms were associated with increased mortality.22 Overall,
describing the impact of depression symptoms on outcomes of
patients with lung cancer may support the development and
implementation of high-quality depression care.
METHODS
Data were used from the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Care
Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium, a pro-
spective, observational, national study of practices and outcomes for
patients with newly diagnosed lung and colorectal cancer. The total lung
cancer cohort was composed of 5,150 participants. The consortium en-
rolled patients from five geographically defined regions, five integrated
health-care delivery systems in the National Cancer Institute -funded
Cancer Research Network, or 15 Veterans Affairs (VA) health-care systems
from September 2003 through December 2005. CanCORS study methods
have been described.23,24 This study was approved by the institutional
review boards at the VA-Portland Health Care System and the VA-Puget
Sound Health Care System.
Cohort Selection
Patients were 21 years of age or older with newly diagnosed invasive
non–small cell or small-cell lung cancer were eligible if they were
identified within 3 months of cancer diagnosis. Several sites over-
sampled black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander patients to in-
crease inclusivity. Participants completed a baseline and follow-up
survey via telephone approximately 5 and 12 months after cancer di-
agnosis, respectively. CanCORS enrolled a demographically and clini-
cally representative cohort, reflective of newly diagnosed patients with
lung cancer in all SEER regions.25 The response rate was 49% and the
cooperation rate was 59%.26 Differences between responders and
nonresponders have been described, as have methods to mitigate
nonresponse bias.23,27 For this analysis, CanCORS participants who
completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D)
scale and had medical records available for review were included. Be-
tween the time of case ascertainment and baseline survey, some par-
ticipants were deceased or too ill to complete full patient surveys that
included the CES-D scale; therefore, these participants were excluded
(Fig 1; Appendix Table A1, online only).
Variables and Measures
Baseline and follow-up patient surveys, physician surveys, and data
from medical records and cancer registries were abstracted. Research staff
were able to contact hospitals and physicians for missing information.
Validated scales were used from published surveys.23,24 A brief, eight-item
version of the CES-D scale28,29 was administered to measure depression
symptoms at baseline and follow-up. The CES-D shows very high internal
consistency and adequate test-retest repeatability.30 The CES-D has good
factor structure and internal consistency in patients with cancer,31
community-dwelling older adults,28 and ethnically diverse adults.32
Scores $4 on the CES-D indicate elevated depression symptoms.33-35
The CES-D includes somatic complaint factors that are not typical lung
cancer symptoms.28,36 Participants were classified based on longitudinal
changes in depression symptoms from baseline to follow-up. Those
without depression symptoms (labeled “never”), those with new de-
pression symptoms at follow-up (labeled “new onset”), those with de-
pression symptom remission at follow-up (labeled “remission”), and those
with persistent depression symptoms from baseline to follow-up (labeled
“persistent”).
Patient-reported psychiatric history was collected at the time of the
baseline patient survey. Patients responded yes or no to the following:
“Have you ever suffered from depression or any other emotional, nervous,
or psychiatric problems?” Patients who answered yes were asked a follow-
up question: “Was it before or after you were diagnosed with lung cancer?”
Possible responses included before, after, or both. Vital status was collected
from established sources and the end date of vital status query was April
2012. Further vital status ascertainment information is available in the
Appendix.
Covariates
Covariates determined at the baseline survey included age, sex,
race/ethnicity, lung cancer stage and histology at diagnosis, income,
education, marital status, smoking and alcohol use, lung cancer
therapies received, and comorbidities. Stage at diagnosis was de-
termined using collaborative staging when possible, or from registry
or medical record review. Comorbidities were determined by using the
Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) index. The ACE-27 is
a 27-item, validated comorbidity index for use in patients with
cancer.37,38
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics at the time of the baseline survey sum-
marized
participants’
demographics
categorized
by
depression
symptoms status. At baseline, participants were categorized as having
depression symptoms or not having symptoms, based on CES-D
scores. At follow-up, participants were categorized by the longitu-
dinal changes in their depression symptoms from baseline and follow-
up CES-D scores, and were classified as never, new-onset, remission,
or persistent depression symptoms. Item nonresponse rate was
negligible across all variables. Incidence of death by baseline and
follow-up depression symptoms status, per 100-person years, was
calculated as the number of deaths divided by the total number of
person-years at risk for death.
The primary outcome was survival measured from the date of the
initial baseline survey until the date of death or censoring. To eliminate

 immortal time, survival for follow-up analyses was measured from the
date of the follow-up survey until the date of death or censoring. Hazard
ratios, 95% CIs, and P values are reported. To compare participants’
mean CES-D scores, t tests with equal variance were used. The overall
drop-out rate at follow-up, not including deaths, was , 10% and not
significantly different between groups. Participants without depression
symptoms at baseline and never participants were used as reference
groups
for
baseline
and
follow-up
analyses,
respectively.
Cox’s
proportional-hazards regression models were fitted to obtain hazard
ratios and corresponding CIs. Regression models were adjusted for age,
sex, race/ethnicity, cancer stage and histology at diagnosis, income,
education, marital status, smoking and alcohol use, and ACE-27 index.
Stage-specific regression models were also adjusted for receipt of Na-
tional Comprehensive Cancer Network–recommended stage-specific
lung cancer treatments.39 The interaction effect between stage and de-
pression symptoms was similarly explored. Psychiatric history was used
to dichotomize participants (yes/no) with depression symptoms at
baseline; regression models are presented using participants with de-
pression symptoms and without a psychiatric history as a reference
group.
Several sensitivity analyses for survival models were conducted.
These adjusted for time from cancer diagnosis to baseline or follow-
up survey completion; excluded somatic items (everything was
effort, sleep was restless, could not get going) from CES-D scoring;
and considered CES-D scores as a continuous variable, which did
not affect results. Survival functions for baseline or follow-up
analyses were estimated from the date of the baseline survey or
the date of the follow-up survey, respectively, until the date of death,
using the Kaplan-Meier method. All analyses were performed using
Stata version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) and two-sided
statistical significance was defined as a resultant P value of .05 or
less.
RESULTS
Among 1,790 participants who completed the baseline survey and
CES-D, 57% were older than 65 years, 45% were female, 72% were
white, 29% were current tobacco users, and 15% received care at
VA health-care systems (Table 1). Considering tumor character-
istics, 66% of participants were diagnosed with non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and 47% of these participants had early-stage
disease (stages I and II). Overall, 681 (38%) participants had
depression symptoms at baseline and 254 of these participants
(62%) still alive remained persistently depressed at follow-up. At
follow-up, 105 participants (14%) had new-onset depression
symptoms. Among all participants, 44% had depression symptoms
at some point during the study. Among participants with de-
pression symptoms at baseline, 288 (42%) reported a prior psy-
chiatric history and, among these, 179 (62%), 75 (26%), and 34
(12%) participants reported problems before, both, or after cancer
diagnosis, respectively.
Baseline
The incidence of death was 27.0 per 100 person-years (95%
CI, 25.1 to 29.1) for participants without depression symptoms
and 34.2 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 31.3 to 37.4) for par-
ticipants with depression symptoms (Table 2). Depression
symptoms were associated with increased mortality (adjusted HR
[AdjHR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.32; P = .01; Table 3). Median

 2.04; P , .001) but not among those with late-stage disease (stages
III and IV) (AdjHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.22; P = .47). Results
were comparable when analyses were restricted to participants with
NSCLC and early-stage disease (AdjHR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.97;
P = .005) or late-stage disease (AdjHR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.29;
P = .63). Among participants with depression symptoms, prior
psychiatric history was not associated with increased mortality
(AdjHR, 1.1.2; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.35; P = .25).
Follow-Up
The incidence of death was 20.2 per 100 person-years (95%
CI, 18.1 to 22.5) for never participants, 26.6 per 100 person-years
(95% CI, 20.5 to 34.5) for new-onset participants, 21.7 per 100
person-years (95% CI, 17.5 to 27.0) for remission participants, and
28.3 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 24.1 to 33.1) for persistent
participants at follow-up (Table 2). At baseline, persistent par-
ticipants had a mean CES-D score (5.9; standard deviation [SD],
1.4) which was significantly different than that of remission
participants (5.2; SD, 1.2; P , .001). At follow-up, persistent
participants (5.8; SD, 1.4) had a mean CES-D score that was
significantly different than that of new-onset participants (5.1; SD,
1.3; P , .001).
Using never participants as a reference group, among new-
onset participants and persistent participants, there was an in-
creased risk of mortality (AdjHR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.01;
P = .006; and AdjHR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.75; P = .001, re-
spectively). Among remission participants, there was no associated
increased risk of mortality (AdjHR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.79 to 1.31;
P = .89). The adjusted HRs between the new-onset and persistent
groups were not significantly different (P = .72; Table 3). The
difference at follow-up in median survival between the depression
symptoms (includes the new-onset and persistent groups) and no-
depression symptoms (includes the never and remission groups)
groups was 130 days (Fig 2). Depression symptoms at follow-up
(includes the new-onset and persistent groups) was associated with
increased mortality among both participants with early-stage
disease (AdjHR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.27 to 2.31; P , .001) and
those with late-stage disease (AdjHR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.69;
P = .025). Results were comparable when analyses were restricted
to participants with NSCLC histology and early-stage disease
(AdjHR,1.50; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.12; P = .02) or late-stage disease
(AdjHR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.99; P = .03).
DISCUSSION
Among patients with lung cancer who received treatment in
multiple care settings, depression symptoms were common around
the time of cancer diagnosis and were often persistent during
treatment. Depression symptoms present at the time of cancer
diagnosis were associated with increased mortality, with the pre-
dominant effect seen among patients with early-stage disease.
Presence of a prior psychiatric history was not associated with
increased mortality among those with depression symptoms at
baseline. At follow-up, new-onset or persistent depression
symptoms were associated with increased mortality. Importantly,

 remission of depression symptoms at follow-up was associated
with comparable mortality as never having had depression
symptoms. These results provide further evidence that depression
symptoms are associated with increased mortality and that lon-
gitudinal changes are significant.
Depression is the most common psychologic symptom in
patients with cancer,40 and patients with lung cancer are at par-
ticularly high risk.5,41 Some patients experience transient symptoms
as an initial reaction to their diagnosis,42 whereas others experience
persistent symptoms for years during survivorship.19,20,43,44 Ap-
proximately half of the study cohort experienced depression symptoms
at some point during the study and symptoms persisted in most
patients. In other cancer populations, persistent symptoms are asso-
ciated with poor adherence to anticancer treatments,7,45 and significant
cognitive46 and functional impairment,47,48 which may contribute to
increased mortality. Receipt of guideline-recommended lung
cancer treatment did not significantly alter study results. Cog-
nitive and functional impairments are aspects of QOL that likely
interact with the depression-mortality causal pathway in ways not
fully elucidated or adjusted for in study analyses. Survival dif-
ferences may also be related to additional comorbidities and
outcomes associated with depression symptoms but not cancer,
such as suicide.
Participants who experienced remission of depression
symptoms at follow-up had a similar mortality rate as those who
were never depressed. The potential reversibility of the negative
effects of depression symptoms deserves further study; if con-
firmed, this would support the importance of effective mental
health treatment. Remission may be achieved with mental health
treatment, although studies of individual pharmacologic and
psychotherapeutic treatments in patients with cancer have yielded
mixed outcomes.2,49,50 More recent studies of integrated, collab-
orative, multicomponent depression interventions for cancer care
have impressive outcomes. In a study of patients with lung cancer
who had major depressive disorder, a multicomponent in-
tervention including evidence-based psychologic therapies such as
behavioral activation was associated with significantly improved
depression scores and remission rates. This intervention led to
significantly better QOL, role functioning, and perceived quality of
care compared with usual depression care.18 In a larger study of this
intervention in patients with various cancer types, there was an
absolute difference in depression remission of 45% at 24 weeks
compared with usual care.51 There was no survival benefit con-
ferred with this intervention in either study. Overall, there is
a paucity of evidence that psychologic or depression treatment
prolongs survival in patients with cancer52,53; however, the limited

Fig 2. Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival based on depression status. Survival was calculated from baseline survey to the time of death, if it occurred during the study
period, or to the time of data censoring. The difference in median estimates of survival between the no depression symptoms group and the depression symptoms group
was 193 days. Depression symptoms were a significant predictor of mortality (hazard ratio for death in the depression symptoms group, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.32) after
adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, lung cancer stage and histology at diagnosis, income, education, marital status, smoking and alcohol use, and Adult Comorbidity
Evaluation-27 (ACE-27) index. (Insert): Survival was calculated from follow-up survey to the time of death, if it occurred during the study period, or to the time of data
censoring. Median estimates of survival from cancer diagnosis were 896 days in the never depression symptoms group, 889 days in the remission of depression
symptoms group, 746 days in the new-onset depression symptoms group, and 778 days in the persistent depression symptoms group. At follow-up, the difference in
median survival between depression symptoms (the new-onset and persistent groups) and no depression symptoms groups (includes the never and remission groups)
was 130 days. Persistent depression symptoms (hazard ratio for death 1.42; 95% CI, 1.15 to 1.75) and new-onset depression symptoms at follow-up (hazard ratio for death,
1.50; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.01) were significant predictors of mortality after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, income, education, marital status, smoking and alcohol use,
cancer stage and histology, and ACE-27 index.

Longitudinal Changes in Depression Symptoms in Lung Cancer
 number of high-quality intervention studies has been noted.50,54
There is growing recognition that psychosocial support is an
essential component of comprehensive cancer care, yet it re-
mains uncertain if effective depression treatment can prolong
survival.16,39,50
Recognizing the substantial impact of depression on adults
with cancer, ASCO has developed a set of practice guidelines for all
professional health-care providers.16 These guidelines recommend
systematic depression screening across the trajectory of cancer care.
If screening instruments indicate the presence of moderate or
severe symptoms, the American Society of Clinical Oncology
recommends patients undergo further diagnostic assessments to
identify the nature and extent of disease. Regular depression as-
sessments throughout the continuum of cancer care, including
survivorship, may help providers identify patients who may most
benefit from treatment. The increased mortality rate among pa-
tients with lung cancer who had depression symptoms was ob-
served predominantly in patients with early-stage disease. Because
these patients are the ones most likely to be cured, attention should
focus on providing support posttreatment into survivorship. Pa-
tients report unmet emotional needs and a desire for psychologic
support during and after completion of cancer treatment.55,56,57
Early detection and prompt treatment can promote remission,
prevent relapse, and reduce the emotional and financial burden of
depression. This approach may diminish the prevalence and
persistence of depression symptoms, and decrease the associated
negative effects of this debilitating disease.
This study has several strengths, including the large sample
size, prospective national ascertainment of patients, oversampling
of nonwhite races/ethnicities, and inclusion of patients from di-
verse health-care settings. The unique inclusion of surveys con-
ducted at two time points, soon after and at 1-year follow-up from
cancer diagnosis, allowed an assessment of how depression
symptoms changed over time. There are limitations. Patients were
surveyed soon after diagnosis; however, some died or were too ill to
complete surveys, which may limit generalizability. Exclusion of
these patients likely underestimates the prevalence of depression
symptoms because low performance status19 and advanced-stage
disease49 are both associated with depression in patients with
cancer. Although validated and used extensively in research, the use
of a brief depression screen may have led to misclassification of
psychologic status for some patients. Gold standard interview-
based assessments for major depressive disorder, in general, report
a lower prevalence of illness than found on screening instruments.
We did not have complete information about patients’ history or
their family history of psychiatric disorders before study entry.
The increased mortality rate among depressed patients during
treatment could have been accounted for by differences in cancer
progression, although cancer characteristics (eg, stage and his-
tology) and cancer treatments received, most likely to predict
cancer activity, were adjusted for in analyses. In addition, a meta-
analysis found no evidence that depression predicts progression in
patients with cancer.58 Among included studies, there was no
evidence of an effect of illness severity, overlapping symptoms,
advanced stage, or differences in effect sizes depending on whether
studies controlled for cancer-related confounders.58 Other possible
mechanisms for increased mortality rates that are associated with
depression, such as suicide, were not available. Our results cannot
prove causation and it is possible patients’ anticipated mortality is
associated with depression symptoms.
In conclusion, depression symptoms are common among
patients with lung cancer at cancer diagnosis and often persist
during cancer treatment. Longitudinal changes in depression
symptoms are associated with significant differences in patient
mortality rates. Depression remission was associated with similar
mortality as never having had depression. These results underscore
the importance of integrated systems of depression treatment of
patients with cancer as part of comprehensive cancer care. Research
is needed to explore depression treatment delivery and determine
whether treatment can actually improve survival.

Vital status was collected from these sources: baseline and follow-up survey, medical record abstraction, database updates,
Social Security Death Index, or the National Death Index. Death was determined based on documentation of known date of death
or date assumed alive based on either no death reported in national records or date of last vital status in plan records for managed
care sites (ie, a patient encounter). Local adjudication of vital status occurred at each site, using a source-specific algorithm. Vital
status data were matched among data sources using the participants’ social security number, sex, and date of birth.
