background Increasingly, women of reproductive 
age participate in recreational running, but its impact on 
pregnancy outcome is unknown. We investigated whether 
running affects gestational age at delivery and birth weight 
as indicators of cervical integrity and placental function, 
respectively.
Methods 1293 female participants were recruited 
from parkrun, which organises weekly runs involving 
1.25 million runners across 450 parks worldwide. Those 
under 16 or unable to provide outcome data were 
excluded. Women were categorised according to whether 
they continued to run during pregnancy or not. Those 
who continued were further stratified dependent on 
average weekly kilometres, and which trimester they ran 
until. Retrospectively collected primary outcomes were 
gestational age at delivery and birthweight centile. Other 
outcomes included assisted vaginal delivery rate and 
prematurity at clinically important gestations.
results There was no significant difference in gestational 
age at delivery: 279.0 vs 279.6 days (mean difference 0.6 
days, CI −1.3 to 2.4 days; P=0.55) or birthweight centile: 
46.9%vs 44.9% (mean difference 2.0%, CI −1.3% to 
−5.3%; P=0.22) in women who stopped running and those 
who continued, respectively. Assisted vaginal delivery 
rate was increased in women who ran: 195/714 (27%) vs 
128/579 (22%) (OR 1.32; CI 1.02 to 1.71; P=0.03).
Conclusion Continuing to run during pregnancy does not 
appear to affect gestational age or birthweight centile, 
regardless of mean weekly distance or stage of pregnancy. 
Assisted vaginal delivery rates were higher in women who 
ran, possibly due to increased pelvic floor muscle tone. 
Randomised prospective analysis is necessary to further 
explore these findings.
InTroduCTIon
Recreational running is increasing; more 
than 2 million people per week run on a 
regular basis in the UK.1 The demographic 
of runners has also changed; 60% of half 
marathon participants are women.2 Many of 
these women are of reproductive age and will 
consult their obstetrician about the advisability 
of running during pregnancy. Guidelines 
recommend 30 minutes of moderate daily 
exercise for most pregnant women based on 
the evidence in the current literature that 
exercise can reduce gestational weight gain 
(GWG).3–5 Limiting GWG can potentially 
minimise the risk of gestational diabetes,6 
hypertension, pre-eclampsia7 and postpartum 
weight retention.8 It also may benefit the 
fetus because GWG is strongly associated with 
large for gestational age (LGA) infants.9 In 
the longer term, according to a recent family 
follow-up study, GWG is positively associated 
What are the new findings?
 
► Recreational running in pregnancy does not appear 
to affect gestational age at delivery or birthweight 
centile.
 
► Further work is needed to establish the potential 
link between running and increased likelihood of 
assisted vaginal delivery.
How it might impact on clinical practice in the 
near future?
 
► Previously, 
evidence 
specifically 
related 
to 
recreational running during pregnancy has been 
scarce.
 
► Pregnant women can now be reassured that 
continuing to run, while pregnant, will not affect their 
baby’s birth weight or increase the likelihood of a 
preterm delivery.

with adult offspring adiposity and cardiometabolic risk 
factors10 11 and therefore effective GWG management 
through exercise may have a significant benefit on child 
growth and chronic disease risk.
There are theoretical concerns that excessive exercise 
during pregnancy can lead to low birth weight, which 
may increase the risk of future central obesity and cardio-
vascular morbidity.12 Other potentially harmful effects 
of exercise in pregnancy are diminished blood flow to 
the uterus,13 exercise generated heat stress leading to 
fetal congenital abnormalities,14 15 preterm delivery, and 
abnormal maternal and fetal heart rates.16 However, it 
is generally accepted that exercise of moderate inten-
sity is likely to be safe during uncomplicated pregnancy 
and should be encouraged.17 There is a lack of sound 
evidence specifically focused on running, a high impact 
activity which involves both feet being off the ground 
simultaneously. Considerable forces, generated as the 
foot strikes the ground, are transmitted through the 
limbs and pelvic girdle, with potential contre coup effects 
within the uterus affecting the integrity of the cervix.
Given the rapidly increasing number of women 
running competitively, or just to keep fit, and keen to 
continue during pregnancy, this is a highly relevant area 
of research. One study concluded that running at inten-
sity above 90% of maximal heart rate could potentially 
compromise fetal well-being.16 But these findings were 
based on a small cohort of 6 elite athletes and therefore 
not necessarily relevant to the current population of 
pregnant female runners who participate in a wide range 
of running activities at different standards and intensi-
ties. It is therefore important to establish whether or not, 
and at what intensity, running puts the fetus at risk. This 
study, the largest of its kind to date, will focus on a group 
of women who signed up to the running group ‘parkrun’ 
who had become pregnant while running regularly, 
and aims to investigate the effects of running on gesta-
tional age at delivery, birthweight centile, assisted vaginal 
delivery rate, prematurity at various clinically important 
gestations and proportion of babies below the 3rd, 5th, 
10th or above the 90th centile.
MeTHods
Participants were recruited from parkrun ( 
parkrun. 
org), 
an organisation with over 1.25 million registrants, which 
organises free weekly timed runs in 450 parks around 
the world. Information about running habits and birth 
outcomes of first pregnancy (>24 weeks’ gestation) was 
collected via an internet-based questionnaire, between 
4 November 2014 and 9 January 2015, from women who 
had previously been pregnant. Previous running history 
was not collected as the effect on future pregnancies 
independent of exercise in pregnancy was felt to be less 
important. SurveyMonkey was used to generate a survey 
that was piloted on a group of 20 runners, to ensure read-
ability and acceptability and compliance. Minor changes 
were made prior to uploading on SurveyMonkey. We have 
attached this survey as online supplementary appendix 1.
Those who had not provided birth weight, gestational 
age data or who had iatrogenic preterm delivery were 
excluded.
The Health Research Authority decision-making tool 
advised that National Health Service (NHS) Research 
Ethics committee approval was not needed. Guy’s and 
 
St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust Research and Devel-
opment Department confirmed that trust approval was 
not required for this work. Consent was implicit in partic-
ipants’ reading of explanatory notes, completing and 
submitting their online survey responses. No participant 
information is identifiable in the publication.
Women were initially categorised according to whether 
they continued to run when they realised they were preg-
nant or if they stopped (primary analysis). They were 
then further divided according to which trimester of 
pregnancy they stopped running (first trimester, second 
trimester, third trimester or never ran in pregnancy, which 
acted as a control group) and mean weekly kilometre 
 
run during pregnancy (never, 1–5 km, 6–12 km and >12 
km) (secondary analysis).
Powered for outcomes were birth weight and gesta-
tional age at delivery. Customised birthweight centiles 
were calculated adjusting for maternal height, weight, 
ethnicity and parity, and for neonatal gender and gesta-
tional age at delivery.18 Babies below the 3rd centile were 
regarded as small for gestational age and those above 
the 90th centile as LGA. Additional outcomes included 
assisted vaginal delivery rates, prematurity at different 
clinically important gestations (<30, <34, <37) and 
proportion of babies below the 3rd, 5th, 10th or above 
the 90th centile.
Power calculation assumptions are based on data from 
5628 singleton pregnancies from the SCOPE cohort (a 
study of normal pregnant women with no risk factors, 
from UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia). Full data 
on 177 women per activity group were needed to detect 
a difference of 10 centile points in mean birthweight 
centiles, and 135 women per activity group, determined 
by whether women ran to first, second, third trimesters or 
stopped running to detect a difference of 1 week gesta-
tion (SD 2.53 weeks’ gestation).19
Statistical analysis was performed using Stata V11.2 
software. The effect on neonatal outcomes of mean 
weekly distance and running into each trimester was 
investigated using linear and logistic regression for mean 
age at delivery and birthweight centile. SEs were adjusted 
for possible non-normal distributions using robust SEs, 
and results are presented as mean differences. Logistic 
regression was used to compare binary outcomes such as 
mode of delivery, and comparisons are presented as ORs. 
Simple unadjusted comparisons are presented. CIs for 
binary outcomes were calculated by the exact method.

to the survey and 1293 full responses were completed for

exclusions for iatrogenic preterm deliveries. Recruit-
ment stopped when we had a predefined power in each 
subgroup: 579/1293 (45%) did not run in pregnancy, 
188/1293 (15%) stopped during their first trimester 
(including women who stopped running when they 
found they were pregnant), 318/1293 (25%) in their 
second trimester and 208/1293 (16%) ran into their 
third trimester. Participant demographics are shown in 
table 1. Women who never ran in pregnancy were 2.3 kg 
heavier than those who continued to run. More women 
who never ran in pregnancy were either overweight (BMI 
24–29.9 kg/m2), or obese (BMJ >30), compared to those 
who continued to run in pregnancy (OR 0.34, 95% CI 
0.18 to 0.67 and OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.61, respec-
tively; P<0.001).
effect of running during pregnancy on gestational age at 
delivery and birthweight centile (powered for outcomes)
There was no significant difference in gestational age at 
delivery (where 280 days is 40 weeks of gestation): 279.0 
vs 279.6 days   (mean difference 0.6 days, CI −1.3 to 2.4 
days; P=0.55) or birthweight centile: 46.9%vs 44.9% 
(mean difference 2.0%, CI −1.3% to −5.3%; P=0.22) in 
women who stopped running and those who continued, 
respectively. Mean weekly running distance and trimester 
women stopped running did not appear to effect either 
outcome as demonstrated by tables 2 and 3, which show 
no particular trend towards earlier delivery or lower 
birthweight centile, respectively, even in those women 
who continued to run the greatest mean weekly distance 
into the third trimester.
effect of running during pregnancy on assisted vaginal 
delivery rate, prematurity at clinically important gestations 
and proportion of babies below the 3rd, 5th, 10th or above the 
90th centile (additional outcomes)
Assisted vaginal delivery rate significantly increased in 
women who ran in pregnancy compared with those who 
stopped; 195/714 (27%) vs 128/579 (22%) (OR 1.32; CI 
1.02 to 1.71; P=0.03) (figure 1), but there was no signif-
icant difference dependent on mean weekly running 
distance or trimester that women stopped running.
Preterm birth rate across all gestations of interest was 
similar regardless of whether women ran in pregnancy 
or not: 5.9% (42/714) vs 7.6% (44/579); P=0.22, and in

those who ran, there was no effect dependent on mean 
weekly running distance or trimester women ran into. 
Furthermore, there was no difference in proportion of 
babies below the 3rd, 5th, 10th or above the 90th centile.
dIsCussIon
There was no significant difference in gestational age 
at delivery or birthweight centile between women who 
stopped running and those who continued during preg-
nancy, regardless of distance, or stage of pregnancy, 
suggesting that recreational running per se has little 
influence on placental function or on mechanisms of 
labour onset. Pressure or impact effects of the fetal head 
on cervical integrity while running appear not to influ-
ence gestation of labour onset. Continuing running when 
pregnant appears to increase the risk of assisted vaginal 
delivery, compared with women who stopped. Overall, 
the rates of assisted vaginal delivery were high (25%) 
although women were reporting their first pregnancy, 
and assisted vaginal delivery rates are generally thought 
to be higher in primiparous women. There is a plau-
sible mechanism for an increase in assistance in runners, 
where exercised pelvic floor muscles may provide a soft 
tissue resistance to crowning of the fetal head that results 
in delay in second stage and an increased requirement 
for assisted vaginal delivery.
Women who stopped running during pregnancy 
reported significantly higher BMIs. Although an inter-
esting observation, this is not sufficient to suggest a 
clear association between running during pregnancy 
and lower maternal weight or reduced weight gain, first 
because women who continued to run during pregnancy 
are likely to be more committed runners with a lower 
BMI to start with, rather than due to the running they did 
while pregnant. Second, women recorded their current 
BMI, rather than BMI during their pregnancy, although, 
for the purposes of this study, current BMI is probably 
a reasonable proxy for BMI at the beginning of partic-
ipants’ pregnancies in this group of motivated, health 
conscious parkrun runners, where BMI is likely to have 
remained relatively stable.
strengths and limitations
We used customised birthweight centiles18 adjusted for 
maternal height, weight, parity and ethnic group, in 
order to avoid the effects of these confounding factors. 
Previous studies have not used this method making it

difficult to attribute their findings solely to the effects 
of exercise. Running habits were established by asking 
women to report which trimester of pregnancy they 
stopped running and how many kilometres they ran on 
average per week. This method was susceptible to recall 
bias, but there is no general consensus in the literature 
about the most reliable way to collect this type of data.20 
To avoid further recall bias, current BMI—as opposed to 
BMI at the time of the reported pregnancy—was recorded 
and this is likely to be similar to their prepregnant BMI 
in a running population. The survey deliberately gath-
ered memorable categorical data to avoid the problems 
associated with inaccurate recall. It is well established 
that recall of gestational age and prior birth weight is 
highly accurate, and the other categorical data that we 
analysed, such as need for assisted delivery, are likely to 
be equally unforgettable.21 22 We excluded any women 
who could not recall this data, further increasing its accu-
racy. By comparing across gestational age time frames, we 
controlled for methodological bias. In this study, we have 
focused solely on running, which is one of its strengths. We 
did not enquire about other exercise undertaken while 
pregnant, nor taken up if they did not run. However, our 
hypothesis concerns the effects of recreational running 
which clearly showed no effect on birth weight and time 
of delivery including with intensity regardless of other 
exercise. Other exercise undertaken by the women in 
addition to running could have contributed to the effects 
on assisted vaginal deliveries independent of running, for 
example, influencing pelvic floor tone making running 
an associative rather than causative factor.
To date, few papers have discussed the impact of a 
specific type of exercise on pregnancy, such as running. 
The need for focused research is well recognised given 
theoretical mechanisms of potential harm being related 
to impact and intensity.13–16 It is appropriate to identify 
running as more intensive than other types of exercise, 
with considerable forces, generated as the foot hits the 
ground, potentially affecting the fetus and the cervix.
Recent American College of Obstetricians and Gyne-
cologists guidelines suggest ‘30 min or more of moderate 
exercise a day on most, if not all, days of the week’.17 The 
few existing studies focusing on running in pregnancy 
have investigated small groups of experienced athletes 
limiting their power to detect important effects in the 
increasingly diverse group of women running during 
pregnancy.16 23 Participants in our study were more repre-
sentative of the range of abilities of women in the general 
running population—their 5 km times ranged from 15 to 
50 min ( 
parkrun. 
org. 
uk)—and as a result, the findings 
are generalisable.
ConClusIon And AreAs for furTHer Work
As more women are running, and many of them are of 
reproductive age, advice specifically about running and 
the effects it may have on their pregnancy is welcomed. On 
balance, on the basis of these findings and previous work, 
women who want to continue running during pregnancy 
can be reassured by their obstetricians that it will not affect 
the birth weight of their baby significantly or increase the 
likelihood of a preterm delivery. To further explore the 
effects of recreational running on birthweight centile and 
gestational age at delivery, as well as assisted vaginal delivery 
rate, a prospective analysis should ideally be carried out, 
where women are randomly allocated to not run during 
pregnancy or to different running regimes. Consideration 
would need to be given to the well-recognised challenge of 
recruiting pregnant women to clinical research, particularly 
that which involves randomisation to an intervention.24
