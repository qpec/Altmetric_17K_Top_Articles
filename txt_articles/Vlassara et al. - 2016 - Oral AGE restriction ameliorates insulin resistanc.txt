Abstract
Aims/hypothesis We previously reported that obese individ-
uals with the metabolic syndrome (at risk), compared with
obese individuals without the metabolic syndrome (healthy
obese), have elevated serum AGEs that strongly correlate with
insulin resistance, oxidative stress and inflammation. We
hypothesised that a diet low in AGEs (L-AGE) would im-
prove components of the metabolic syndrome in obese indi-
viduals, confirming high AGEs as a new risk factor for the
metabolic syndrome.
Methods A randomised 1 year trial was conducted in obese
individuals with the metabolic syndrome in two parallel groups:
L-AGE diet vs a regular diet, habitually high in AGEs (Reg-
AGE). Participants were allocated to each group by
randomisation using random permuted blocks. At baseline
and at the end of the trial, we obtained anthropometric variables,
blood and urine samples, and performed OGTTs and MRI mea-
surements of visceral and subcutaneous abdominal tissue and
carotid artery. Only investigators involved in laboratory
determinations were blinded to dietary assignment. Effects on
insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were the primary outcome.
Results Sixty-one individuals were randomised to a Reg-AGE
diet and 77 to an L-AGE diet; the data of 49 and 51, respec-
tively, were analysed at the study end in 2014. The L-AGE diet
markedly improved insulin resistance; modestly decreased
body weight; lowered AGEs, oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion; and enhanced the protective factors sirtuin 1, AGE recep-
tor 1 and glyoxalase I. The Reg-AGE diet raised AGEs and
markers of insulin resistance, oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion. There were no effects on MRI-assessed measurements.
No side effects from the intervention were identified.
HOMA-IR came down from 3.1±1.8 to 1.9±1.3 (p<0.001)
in the L-AGE group, while it increased from 2.9±1.2 to 3.6
±1.7 (p<0.002) in the Reg-AGE group.
Conclusions/interpretation L-AGE ameliorates insulin resis-
tance in obese people with the metabolic syndrome, and may
reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes, without necessitating a
major reduction in adiposity. Elevated serum AGEs may be
used to diagnose and treat ‘at-risk’ obesity.

Introduction
Current efforts to arrest the epidemics of type 2 diabetes
and cardiovascular disease, as well as dementia or
Alzheimer’s disease, have had limited success [1–3].
Obesity is a prevalent component of type 2 diabetes, of-
ten coupled with insulin resistance, hypertension and
dyslipidaemia in a cluster known as the metabolic syn-
drome, associated with chronic oxidative stress and in-
flammation [4–6]. Overnutrition is thought to be a major
cause of obesity [5]. However, many obese people do not
develop the metabolic syndrome and have been labelled
‘healthy obese’ [7–9]. Although excessive consumption
of fatty foods is considered an important cause of the
metabolic syndrome [4, 5], this view has recently come
under new scrutiny [10, 11]. Thus, there is a need to
identify alternative causes and treatments for ‘at-risk’
obese people.
Thermally prepared foods are rich in pro-inflammatory
AGEs, which are also flavourful, a fact that enhances pal-
atability and consumption and therefore may promote
weight gain [12, 13]. Excessive intake of dietary AGEs
has directly and causally been linked in both humans and
mice to high serum AGEs, oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion, reduced innate defences, and insulin resistance
[12–19]. In a cross-sectional study of obese individuals
with and without the metabolic syndrome, we recently
found a direct correlation between AGEs and insulin resis-
tance. Obese individuals with the metabolic syndrome had
significantly higher dietary AGE intake and serum AGEs,
as well as insulin resistance, oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion, compared with healthy or obese individuals without
the metabolic syndrome [20]. Two distinct serum AGE
markers, carboxymethyllysine (CML) and methylglyoxal
(MG) derivatives, were markedly elevated in this popula-
tion and strongly correlated with elevated HOMA-IR, oxi-
dative stress and inflammation, and decreased protective or
host defence factors, such as sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and AGE
receptor 1 (AGER1) [20].
Based on these observations, we hypothesised that
high serum AGE levels in at-risk obese adults contrib-
ute to the risk of type 2 diabetes. We proposed that a
1 year randomised interventional trial with dietary AGE
restriction (L-AGE) would improve metabolic syndrome
risk factors.
Methods
Clinical protocol
Selection criteria to participate in the study have already been
published [20]. Briefly, volunteers aged 50 years or above
with at least two of the following five criteria of the metabolic
syndrome, based on the Third Report of the National
Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection,
Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in
Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) (NCEPATP III) [21], were
recruited from the New York City urban community surround-
ing the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai: (1) waist
circumference ≥102 cm in men and ≥88 cm in women; (2) BP
≥130/85 mmHg (or use of BP-lowering medication); (3)
HDL-cholesterol <1.04 mmol/l in men or <1.29 mmol/l in
women; (4) triacylglycerol ≥1.69 mmol/l (or use of medica-
tion for high triacylglycerol, such as fibrates or nicotinic acid);
and (5) fasting blood glucose ≥5.55 mmol/l, but an HbA1c
≤6.5%/47.5 mmol/mol, or use of metformin. Volunteers were
screened with a 3 day AGE food record and those whose daily
intake was ≥12 AGE equivalents per day were invited to
participate in the study. These participants were then
randomised either to a L-AGE diet or to their usual diet
(Reg-AGE) and used as controls for the next 12 months
(Fig. 1). Routine blood tests were performed in the hospital
clinical laboratory. Only investigators involved in laboratory
determinations were blinded to the dietary assignment.
Participant recruitment started in 2011 and the trial finished
in 2014.
All volunteers signed a consent form approved by the Icahn
School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Review
Board. The study was registered in www.clinicaltrials.gov
(NCT01363141).
L-AGE participants prepared their own food at home
after being individually instructed on how to reduce dietary
AGE intake by modifying the cooking time and tempera-
ture without changing the quantity, quality or composition
of food. They were specifically instructed to avoid frying,
baking or grilling, and they were encouraged to prepare
their food by boiling, poaching, stewing or steaming
(Table 1). It has been previously demonstrated that
switching to these suggested methods of cooking limits
new AGE formation in foods, especially animal food prod-
ucts [15]. Participants received a personal interview with
the study dietitian every 3 months at the clinic to empha-
sise instructions and review records. In addition, a dietitian
contacted them regularly via telephone (twice/week) to
evaluate and promote dietary compliance. Together these
measures helped avoid undue changes in calorie consump-
tion while adhering to L-AGE.
All participants underwent a physical examination
and provided a medical history at baseline. A fasting
2182
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2181–2192
 blood sample, a 24 h urine sample and previously val-
idated 3 day food records were obtained at baseline and
at 12 months (end of study). During these visits, partic-
ipants also underwent an OGTT (75 g oral glucose load,
followed by serum samples at 0, 60 and 120 min) and
abdominal and neck MRI to define subcutaneous and
visceral adipose fat distribution and carotid wall artery
variables. Routine blood tests were performed in the
hospital clinical laboratory. HOMA-IR was calculated
from fasting blood glucose and insulin as previously
published [22].
Dietary intake
Assessment of daily dietary AGE content was based on 3 day
food records and estimated from a database of ∼560 foods
which lists AGE values [15] expressed as AGE equivalents
per day (1 AGE equivalent=1000 kilounits). The 3 day food
record is based on established guidelines developed to assist in
estimating portions [15]. Nutrient intakes, important in mon-
itoring and preventing undue changes in calorie consumption,
were then estimated from food records using a nutrient
software program (Food Processor, version 10.1; ESHA
Research, Salem, OR, USA).
Imaging studies (MRI)
Subcutaneous and visceral abdominal fat deposits were
assessed as previously described [23, 24] (electronic supple-
mentary material [ESM] Methods).
Materials
See ESM Methods.
AGE determination
AGEs (CML and MG) in serum, urine and peripheral
blood mononuclear cell (PMNC) lysates were determined
by well-validated, competitive ELISAs based on monoclo-
nal antibodies for protein-bound CML (4G9) [25, 26] and
protein-bound MG derivatives, i.e. arginine-MG-H1,
characterised by HPLC [12], shown to detect pathological-
ly relevant AGEs in multiple studies [12–15, 27] (ESM
Methods).

 RNA isolation and qRT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from PMNCs using TRIzol reagent
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA). First-strand cDNA synthesis was per-
formed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN, USA). AGER1 (also known as DDOST),
receptor for AGEs (RAGE, also known as AGER) and SIRT1
mRNA expression were analysed by quantitative SYBR
Green real-time PCR. The transcript copy number of target
genes was determined based on their Ct values [17, 20, 27]
(ESM Methods).
Ex vivo studies
Cell culture
PMNCs from individuals with the metabolic syndrome were
separated from fasting, EDTA anticoagulated blood by Ficoll-
Hypaque Plus gradient (GE Healthcare Bioscience,
Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and incubated in serum-free culture me-
dia AIM-V (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37°C with 5%
CO2 for 1 h, followed by the addition of MG-BSA (60 μg/ml)
[12, 14, 16]. MG-BSA contained 22 MG-modified arginine
residues per mole based on HPLC. MG-BSA was passed
through an endotoxin-binding affinity column (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA) to remove endotoxins [12, 14] (ESM
Methods). Cells were incubated with or without the SIRT1
inhibitor Sirtinol (10 μmol/l; Calbiochem, La Jolla,
CA, USA) or a SIRT1 activator, SRT1720 (1 μmol/l;
Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA). After 72 h, the cells were
harvested for western blotting, the culture medium was cen-
trifuged at 1000g for 10 min and the supernatant fraction was
collected for testing human TNFα levels with an ELISA kit
(Invitrogen) [28]. In a separate study, PMNCs from normal
volunteers without the metabolic syndrome, described previ-
ously [20], were used as controls for PMNCs from individuals
with the metabolic syndrome. All baseline cellular data were
collected from PMNCs obtained at study commencement.
Conditioned medium
PMNCs freshly isolated at baseline and at study end were
plated in serum-free culture media at 37°C with 5% CO2 for
24 h. The media were collected and centrifuged to remove
cells and other particles and concentrated by Amicon Ultra

ments [14].
Adipocyte culture and treatment
3T3-L1 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), cultured and dif-
ferentiated, as described [12], were incubated with DMEM or
PMNC conditioned medium diluted at 1:500 with DMEM for
18–24 h. After washing and replacing media with Hanks’
Balanced Salt Solution for 1 h, cells were stimulated with
insulin (100 nmol/l) for 30 min before they were harvested.
Western blotting
After incubating PMNCs with MG-BSA and with or without
Sirtinol or SRT1720 for 72 h, cells were disrupted in lysis
buffer. The cellular proteins were separated on 8% SDS-
PAGE gels, transferred on to polyvinylidene fluoride mem-
branes and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. To
test for NFkB acetylation, 250 μg protein lysate was
immunoprecipitated by an anti-NFkB p65 antibody at 4°C
overnight. Protein A/G agarose beads 60 μl were added. The
immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted with a specific anti-
acetyl-NFkB p65 (lysine 310) antibody, 3T3-L1 adipocyte
lysates (50 μg) were immunoblotted by anti-phospho-Akt
(Ser473) antibody or immunoprecipitated (400 μg) by anti-
insulin receptor-β antibody, followed by immunoblotting with
anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Of the 383 individuals originally screened for eligibility, 138
were randomised (Fig. 1). Participants were considered eligi-
ble for analysis if they attended at least the 6 month clinic
appointment. The pre-specified statistical analysis plan de-
fined the study outcomes to be the mean differences between
the final recorded values minus the baseline values for the
Reg-AGE and L-AGE groups. The primary outcome variable
was taken to be HOMA-IR. Sample size was established on
the basis of prior studies showing an effect of L-AGE on
healthy individuals who had a difference in HOMA-IR be-
tween those on L-AGE and those on normal diets of 4.57
[17]. To find a difference of 4 with 80% power would require
a sample size of 98. Allowing for ∼20% dropout, a sample
size of 120 was proposed (60 in each group, to maximise
power). Due to a higher per cent dropout in the L-AGE group,
the total recruitment was increased to 138 (Fig. 1).
The study statistician performed the randomisation and all
statistical analyses (Stata software, version 12; StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX, USA). Descriptive analyses summarised
continuous variables at baseline through their mean (SD) and
median (first quartile, third quartile). Categorical variables
were summarised using percentages. On the whole, the out-
come variables (the differences between the mean within-
intervention group differences over the length of the trial)
were not greatly skewed. Thus, although the primary analyses
were from t tests, sensitivity analyses were conducted using
both general linear models, to adjust for sex, race, BMI and
baseline age, and non-parametric Wilcoxon tests in case of
skewed variables.

Human data
General description
Baseline characteristics of cohorts randomised to L-AGE and
Reg-AGE who finished the study (Fig. 1) are shown in
Table 2. Both groups included participants who had two or
more features of the metabolic syndrome and displayed no
baseline differences in any variables, except for BMI, serum
vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and glyoxalase I.
We have previously compared this population with a cohort of
age- and sex-matched volunteers without the metabolic syn-
drome [20].
Interventional data
AGE restriction markedly improves insulin resistance and
modestly reduces body weight The effects of the interven-
tion on the different variables are depicted in Table 3 and ESM
Table 1. The L-AGE compared with the Reg-AGE diet led to a
marked decrease in HOMA, fasting plasma insulin and insulin
levels at 120 min of an OGTT (Fig. 2a, b). There were no end-
of-study effects on fasting blood glucose, HbA1c levels or
blood glucose at 60 and 120 min of the OGTT. However,
HOMA decreased in 80% of participants on the L-AGE diet
compared with 31% on the Reg-AGE diet.
Both diets were associated with a modest weight loss,
which reached significance only in the L-AGE group
(Table 3; ESM Table 1). Of note, markers of insulin resistance
(HOMA and fasting plasma insulin), as well as serum AGEs
and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation, including
8-isoprostanes, RAGE and TNFα, were reduced even in those
participants on the L-AGE diet who did not lose body weight
(n = 12). By comparison, there were no such end-of-study
changes in participants on the Reg-AGE diet who lost weight
(n=25) (ESM Table 2).
We observed no end-of-study effects on abdominal visceral
and subcutaneous fat deposits or on carotid wall variables by
MRI, and there was no effect on BP, plasma triacylglycerols or
HDL (Table 3; ESM Table 1).
Diabetologia (2016) 59:2181–2192
2185
 The effect of the L-AGE diet on HOMA-IR remained
highly significant, after adjusting for baseline BMI and
intake of calories, protein, carbohydrate and fat, as well
as age, sex and race.
Dietary AGE restriction improves inflammatory and host
defence markers There were marked decreases in circulating
AGE markers (serum CML and MG) (Fig. 2c), as well as in
intracellular AGEs (iCML and iMG) of PMNCs and in urinary

 adiponectin and glyoxalase I were increased in this group at
the end of the study. By comparison, and similar to earlier
studies [17, 19], in the Reg-AGE group, 8-isoprostanes,
RAGE, HOMA-IR and leptin levels continued to increase
(Table 3; Fig. 2a). There were no differences in lipid levels
or renal function before and after the study in either group
(Table 3).
Sex, race, ethnicity and AGEs None of the above effects of
the L-AGE diet were modified after adjusting for sex, age,
race or ethnicity. There were no significant side effects report-
ed by either group during the intervention, although more
participants in the L-AGE group were lost to follow-up
(Fig. 1).
Ex vivo data: L-AGE intervention reverses host deficiency
of PMNCs, improving dysmetabolic effects on adipocytes
PMNCs from metabolic syndrome volunteers were compared
with PMNCs from healthy individuals, as previously de-
scribed [20]. Cells from those with the metabolic syndrome
had lower SIRT1 and AGER1 and increased TNFα protein
levels, consistent with a pro-inflammatory metabolic syn-
drome PMNC phenotype [20], compared with PMNCs from
participants without the metabolic syndrome (Fig. 3a, b).
Ex vivo stimulation of baseline PMNCs with MG-BSA
suppressed SIRT1 and AGER1 protein levels (Fig. 3c) and
increased inflammatory markers (via JNK phosphorylation),
marked by increased TNFα secretion (Fig. 3d, e). These re-
sponses were modulated by a SIRT1 agonist and a SIRT1
inhibitor (Fig. 3a–c), directly implicating SIRT1 in these
events [29].
At study end, PMNCs from L-AGE, but not Reg-AGE,
participants, displayed lower TNFα secretion (Fig. 4a; ESM
Table 1). Moreover, when insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipo-
cytes were exposed to the L-AGE conditioned medium from
PMNCs obtained at study end, they revealed an improved Akt
and insulin receptor phosphorylation pattern compared with
adipocytes exposed to Reg-AGE conditioned medium
(Fig. 4b, c).
Discussion
This 1 year intervention shows that L-AGE diet can improve
insulin resistance, a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes, in
obese people with the metabolic syndrome. It also provides
clinical evidence that elevated levels of AGEs, related to
AGE-rich diets, are a causal factor of insulin resistance.
Since maintaining weight reduction is a difficult objective,
finding that L-AGE mitigates insulin resistance in at-risk
obese people introduces a novel additional approach (e.g. to
calorie restriction or drugs) in the treatment of insulin resis-
tance, and, thus, prevention or delay of type 2 diabetes. Since
this was possible without a modification in energy intake, or
substantial weight reduction, L-AGE may offer a feasible
treatment goal of risk reduction in obese people.
We recently reported that obese individuals with the meta-
bolic syndrome consume significantly greater amounts of di-
etary AGEs compared with healthy obese individuals even
when consuming similar amounts of calories [20]. Herein,

 after 1 year of L-AGE, insulin resistance markers including
HOMA and plasma insulin (fasting and 2 h OGTT) as well as
leptin markedly decreased to near-normal levels [20]. There
was also a modest weight loss in the L-AGE group, the impact
of which on insulin resistance is uncertain. However, insulin
resistance changes were independent of BMI, as well as of
total calorie and nutrient consumption. Furthermore, insulin
resistance markers (HOMA, fasting plasma insulin and leptin)
improved even in those on the L-AGE diet who did not have
any change in body weight. Moreover, those on the Reg-AGE
diet who lost body weight were found at study end to have
increased levels of markers of insulin resistance or of oxida-
tive stress and inflammation (ESM Table 2). Together these
findings are consistent with the view that insulin resistance is
partly independent of adiposity.
In the absence of overt diabetes or renal failure, dietary
AGE consumption is shown to promote high serum AGE
levels, which can influence insulin sensitivity [17–19]; thus,
dietary AGEs are a risk factor for insulin resistance and the
metabolic syndrome, distinct from overnutrition. Diets rich in
flavourful AGEs [13] may promote food consumption and can
lead to obesity [20].
The marked reductions in serum and PMNC (intracellular)
AGEs, due to the L-AGE diet, together with reduced TNFα as
well as RAGE levels, in this non-diabetic cohort with the
metabolic syndrome (normal HbA1c and fasting blood glu-
cose) confirm the view that dietary AGEs can foment
dysmetabolism via oxidative stress and inflammation [20,
29]. Indeed in the L-AGE group oxidative stress and inflam-
mation decreased in tandem with insulin resistance, thus
delaying progression to type 2 diabetes. By comparison, wors-
ening insulin resistance and markers of oxidative stress and
inflammation in the Reg-AGE group, also noted in shorter
trials [17], were possibly due to an expanding net AGE pool
from both exogenous and endogenous sources. Thus, this
1 year trial temporally documents increased risk of progres-
sion to type 2 diabetes linked to an AGE-rich diet.
The L-AGE diet benefited several defensive factors which
were found to be suppressed at baseline [20], including
SIRT1, a master regulator of inflammation, insulin action,

 fat mobilisation [7, 30, 31] and cognitive function [32];
AGER1, an AGE receptor that antagonises AGEs, oxidative
stress and inflammation [33]; and the anti-inflammatory
adiponectin [34]. Restored SIRT1 and AGER1 have been im-
plicated in the benefits of L-AGE on the metabolic syndrome
as well as on dementia or Alzheimer’s disease in mice [14, 24,
35]. L-AGE increased mRNA levels of GLO1, encoding
glyoxalase I, an MG-degrading enzyme (thus a protective fac-
tor) [36], which is an altogether new and novel finding. Taken
together, levels of seven genes important in the balance of
oxidative stress and inflammation were largely restored to
normal by the L-AGE diet at the end of the study. Greater
bioavailability of native antioxidants under the L-AGE diet
might also have contributed to those effects.
The effects of L-AGE on PMNCs were likely reflected in
peripheral tissues, although we did not directly assess adipose
tissue [14, 27]. At study end, PMNCs from L-AGE individ-
uals secreted less TNFα, such that PMNCs no longer impaired
adipocyte responses to insulin. Indeed, PMNCs, like macro-
phages, participate in adipocyte dysfunction [28, 36], and
chronic dietary AGE excess by inciting PMNC activation
can impair adipocyte insulin sensitivity [12]. The pro-
inflammatory phenotype of PMNCs was reversed at study
end by the L-AGE diet, strongly concurring at the cellular
level with the systemic findings. The net effect of L-AGE on
the balance of oxidative stress and inflammation involved a
robust improvement in insulin resistance.
The absence of changes at study end on central fat or ca-
rotid wall area by MRI in either group may be partly because
there were no detectable abnormalities at baseline. Similarly,
there were no effects on BP, plasma HDL or triacylglycerols,
possibly due to the concurrent use of BP- and lipid-lowering
drugs. We did not find that age, race, ethnicity and sex had an
effect on the efficacy of the intervention.
AGEs may be estimated by immunochemical (ELISA) [25,
26, 37], chromatographic and mass-spectroscopy methods
[18, 38]. Herein, AGEs were assessed by ELISA, a standard
method used extensively to demonstrate their role in chronic
disease as well as the benefits of AGE modulation in restoring
health [12–15, 17–20, 25–27, 29, 33].
Weaknesses of this trial include the relatively small cohort
size and the use of HOMA-IR instead of direct assessment

 methods of insulin resistance and sensitivity [39]. This 1 year
L-AGE trial did not directly demonstrate an effect on the rate of
progression to overt type 2 diabetes; however, insulin resis-
tance, and thus risk of type 2 diabetes, decreased in the majority
(80%) of L-AGE participants, compared with only 31% in the
Reg-AGE group. More withdrawals in the L-AGE group might
have resulted from dietary behavioural changes requiring sig-
nificant effort and time commitment only in this subgroup.
In conclusion, L-AGE is effective against insulin resistance
in obese individuals with the metabolic syndrome. Longer
trials employing L-AGE alone or combined with other inter-
ventions should determine efficacy on risk of cardiovascular
disease and other features of the metabolic syndrome.
