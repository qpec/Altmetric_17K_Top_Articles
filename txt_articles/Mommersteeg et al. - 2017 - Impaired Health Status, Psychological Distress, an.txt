P
atients with nonobstructive coronary artery disease 
(NOCAD), or mild stenosis, have detected visible wall 
irregularities, but no obstructive coronary luminal narrowing 
(<60% stenosis) in ≥1 epicardial arteries.1–3 NOCAD has been 
associated with an elevated risk of major adverse cardiovascu-
lar events and all-cause mortality when compared with a ref-
erence population without coronary artery disease (CAD).4,5 
Traditional treatment for CAD mainly focuses on functional 
outcomes, such as survival and mortality. However, these rates 
do not reflect all aspects of health. Patient-perceived health 
status, psychological distress, and personality are factors that 
are known to affect clinical outcomes in patients with estab-
lished CAD.4,6–8 As such, these psychosocial factors serve as 
proxy risk factors for future cardiovascular events.9
Health status is a subjective measure of overall well-being 
and reflects how a disease and its symptoms are interpreted by 
the patient.10 Oldridge et al11 argued that the goal of today’s 
medicine should be to increase patients’ quantity of life, as 
well as their quality of life, or health status. Psychological 
distress (symptoms of anxiety and depression, and relative 
Background—Patients with nonobstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD; wall irregularities, stenosis <60%), and 
women with NOCAD in particular, remain underinvestigated. We examined sex and gender (S&G) differences in health 
status, psychological distress, and personality between patients with NOCAD and the general population, as well as S&G 
differences within the NOCAD population.
Methods and Results—In total, 523 patients with NOCAD (61±9 years, 52% women) were included via coronary angiography 
and computed tomography as part of the TWIST (Tweesteden Mild Stenosis) study. Generic health status (12-item Short 
Form physical and mental scales and fatigue), psychological distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety and 
depressive symptoms and Global Mood Scale negative and positive affect), and personality (Type D personality) were 
compared between patients with NOCAD and an age- and sex-matched group of 1347 people from the general population. 
Frequency matching was performed to obtain a similar sex distribution in each age–decile group. Both men and women 
with NOCAD reported impaired health status, more psychological distress, and Type D personality compared with men 
and women in the reference group. Women reported more psychosocial distress compared with men, but no significant sex-
by-group interaction effects were observed. Women with NOCAD reported impaired health status, more anxiety, and less 
positive affect, but no differences in depressive symptoms, angina, or Type D personality when compared with men with 
NOCAD. Age, education, employment, partner, and alcohol use explained these S&G differences within the NOCAD group.
Conclusions—In both men and women, NOCAD was associated with impaired health status, more psychological distress, 
and Type D personality when compared with a reference population. Factors reflecting S&G differences explained these 
S&G findings in patient-reported outcomes.

absence of positive affect [PA]) has been related to cardiac 
outcomes.8,12,13 Type D personality represents people who 
experience negative emotions (negative affectivity [NA]) and 
at the same time inhibit these emotions in social situations 
(social inhibition [SI]). Type D personality has been associ-
ated with poor physical and mental health status14,15 and more 
chest pain in patients with NOCAD.16
Patients with established CAD,17 as well as population-based 
self-reported CAD which included myocardial infarction (MI) 
or angina, are known to have significantly impaired health status 
and more depressive symptoms compared with those without 
CAD.18,19 Wheeler et al20 reported more depressive symptoms 
and poorer mental health status in patients with NOCAD com-
pared with obstructive CAD and a reference group. However, 
NOCAD was based on either normal coronary angiographic 
results in addition to minor lesions (<50%), and some patients 
with NOCAD had a history of MI. Little is known about 
impaired health status and psychological distress in patients 
with NOCAD based on visible coronary irregularities when 
compared with the general population. Moreover, women tend 
to report impaired health status and more depressive symptoms 
when compared with men.19,21 Measuring health status, psycho-
logical distress, and personality among patients with NOCAD 
provides information about the societal burden of this condition.
There is a lack of knowledge on sex and gender (S&G) 
differences in patients with NOCAD, which in turn can lead to 
undertreatment and suboptimal care.2,22 The increased recogni-
tion of S&G differences in patients with NOCAD and health 
status outcomes, and the implications for clinical practice, has 
led to calls for more S&G sensitivity and specificity in future 
research and within clinical practice.23 Whereas the term sex 
implies biological differences, gender is a broad term reflect-
ing social and cultural effects.24 The terms sex and gender are 
interchangeably used in cardiovascular research because it is 
difficult to distinguish between both.22 Moreover, a multitude 
of other aspects differentiate people, including age, socio-
economic status, and ethnicity. Some of these factors further 
differentiating S&G differences can be acknowledged in car-
diac populations. For example, women are on average 7 to 10 
years older when cardiovascular disease emerges, but younger 
women with CAD are at increased risk for adverse outcomes.22 
Potential factors related to individual differences which may 
add to explain S&G differences will be examined in this study.
The main objective of this study was to examine S&G 
differences in health status, psychological distress, and per-
sonality subtypes between patients with NOCAD, as part of 
the TWIST (Tweesteden Mild Stenosis) observational cohort 
study, and a sex- and age-matched reference group from the 
general population. We hypothesized that both women and 
men with NOCAD would have impaired health status scores, 
more negative psychological distress, reduced PA, and more 
Type D personality characteristics when compared with the 
reference group. We further hypothesized that within the 
NOCAD group, women would report impaired health status, 
more psychological distress, and more Type D personality 
when compared with men. We also examine covariates that 
could provide more insight in the role of S&G differences.
Methods
Patients and Procedure
This study is part of the TWIST observational cohort study. All pa-
tients in the TweeSteden Hospital Tilburg, being referred by their 
cardiologist and receiving coronary angiography (CAG) or 64-slice 
computed tomography (CT), were screened for eligibility between 
January 2009 and January 2013. The TWIST study was initiated to 
study classic and novel risk markers for NOCAD.15 Patients were eli-
gible if they had a CT calcium score >0 without additional referral to 
CAG, or CAG diagnosed mild coronary stenosis with visible nonob-
structive wall irregularities. Exclusion criteria were severe coronary 
stenosis (>60%); a previous history of cardiac events, such as MI, 
percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary artery bypass 
graft (CABG) surgery, or heart failure; and insufficient knowledge 
of the Dutch language. In total, 883 patients were eligible for par-
ticipation and received information on the study, as has previously 
been described in more detail.16 In total, 547 (62%) patients signed 
informed consent, of which 523 completed a set of questionnaires 
which were send and returned by postal mail. The research proto-
col was approved by the medical ethics committee of the Elisabeth 
Hospital Tilburg, and written informed consent was obtained from 
all participants (METC Brabant protocol number: NL22258.008.08).
Data were collected ≤3 months after CAG or CT scan and in-
cluded self-reported demographic variables (sex, age, marital status, 
and educational level) and lifestyle factors. Disease status and history, 
medication use, and comorbidity were retrieved from patient hospital 
records. Biochemical correlates were collected but are not reported 
in this study.
Reference Group
The reference group of sex- and age-matched controls was selected 
from a convenience sample of 3389 participants from the Dutch general 
population residing in the Southern provinces of the Netherlands (pop-
ulation of ≈4 million), collected between 2007 and 2010. Participants 
were approached personally or by phone by research assistants. 
Participants received an informed consent form and a questionnaire, 
which were returned in closed, coded envelopes. Questionnaires used 
for this study were the 12-item Short Form, Fatigue Assessment Scale, 
Global Mood Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the 
Type D personality scale, as well as descriptive sociodemographic 
WHAT IS KNOWN
• Women with cardiovascular disease more often 
report impaired health status and worse psychologi-
cal distress.
• Women present more often with nonobstructive cor-
onary artery disease (NOCAD), but sex and gender 
(S&G) differences in health status and psychologi-
cal distress are not well investigated in patients with 
NOCAD.
WHAT THE STUDY ADDS
• In both men and women, NOCAD was associated 
with impaired health status, more psychological dis-
tress, and Type D personality when compared with 
a reference population, and women reported higher 
patient-reported outcomes compared with men.
• S&G differences were of similar magnitude in 
patients with NOCAD and the reference group.
• Age, education, partner, employment, and alcohol 
use, reflecting S&G differences, explained these 
S&G differences in patient-reported outcomes.

information. Comorbid conditions were based on self-reported ‘physi-
cian or specialist diagnosed presence’ of among others cardiovascular 
disease, lung conditions, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and hyper-
tension, with an open-ended question to further specify. Cardiac medi-
cation use was reported as statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme 
inhibitors, or β-blockers with examples of brand names provided.
Approval for this study was obtained from a local ethics com-
mittee at Tilburg University (protocol number: 2006/1101). The ref-
erence group was sex and age matched with the 523 patients with 
NOCAD as part of the TWIST cohort, ensuring similar sex distri-
bution within each age–decile, providing 1347 matched reference 
participants.
Measures
Health Status
Health status was measured by the 12-item Short Form in both 
the reference and the NOCAD group25 and by the Seattle Angina 
Questionnaire (SAQ) in the NOCAD group only.26 The generic 12-
item Short Form is a short alternative to the psychometrically sound 
Short Form-36.25 It consists of a physical component summary and 
a mental component summary, which evaluate physical and mental 
health, respectively. High scores indicate better health status. For the 
calculation of total scores, normative data presented in a Dutch study 
were used.27
The SAQ was used to measure disease-specific perceived health 
status.26 The SAQ is a 19-item, self-administered questionnaire, 
which has been shown to be a valid, responsive, and reliable instru-
ment.26 The SAQ measures 5 clinically relevant dimensions: physical 
limitation, angina stability, angina frequency, treatment satisfaction, 
and disease and perception. Higher scores indicate fewer complaints 
and better health status.
Fatigue was assessed with the Fatigue Assessment Scale, which 
consists of 10 items that are answered on a 5-point rating scale from 
1 (never) to 5 (always).28 Higher fatigue scores indicate more fatigue. 
The internal consistency of the Fatigue Assessment Scale was 0.88.
Psychological Distress and Personality
Psychological distress was represented by anxiety, depressive symp-
toms, NA and PA, and personality by Type D personality. Anxiety 
and depressive symptoms were measured by the Hospital Anxiety 
and Depression Scale (HADS).29,30 The HADS contains two 7-item 
scales: one measuring anxiety (HADS-A), and one measuring de-
pressive symptoms (HADS-D), both with a range of 0 to 21. The 
internal consistency was 0.85 for HADS-A and 0.84 for HADS-D. 
Moderate–high anxiety and moderate–high depressive symptoms 
were calculated using a cutoff of ≥8.30
The Global Mood Scale measures NA and PA, using 10 negative 
(fatigued and listless) and 10 positive (lively and hard working) terms 
that especially tap vitality concepts that are commonly reported by 
cardiac patients.31 The extent to which a respondent has experienced 
each state is asked on a 5-point Likert scale (ranging from 0, not at 
all to 4, extremely), and scores on both the NA and PA scales range 
from 0 to 40.
Type D personality was assessed with the 14-item Type D scale 
14, comprising two 7-item subscales measuring NA and SI on a 0 to 4 
range.32 A cutoff of 10 on both NA and SI is used to classify subjects 
into 4 personality subgroups, Type D personality (high NA and high 
SI), high NA (with low SI), high SI (with low NA), and a low distress 
subgroup (low NA and low SI). Cronbach α was 0.88 and 0.86 for NA 
and SI, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22 was used for all 
statistical analysis. χ2 tests were used for categorical variables and 
1-way ANOVA for continuous variables. Because matching does not 
control for confounding by the matching variable,33 S&G stratified 
group differences were additionally examined adjusted for age using 
logistic and linear regression. Findings showing a different outcome 
when adjusted for age were reported.
Univariate analyses were done to examine S&G×group interac-
tions for the continuous psychosocial outcomes; logistic regression 
analyses were performed to examine S&G×group interactions for 
the dichotomized outcomes (moderate–high anxiety and depressive 
symptoms); and a multinomial logistic regression was performed to 
examine S&G×group interactions of the 4 personality subgroups.
Sensitivity analyses were run with the NOCAD patients further 
stratified by CAG and CT inclusion. Difference between the refer-
ence group and either the CAG or the CT NOCAD group was exam-
ined for men and women; S&G differences within the CAG or CT 
group were examined, as well as S&G×group interactions.
In the NOCAD group, patients with a history of MI, PCI, CABG, 
or heart failure were excluded. Additional analyses were run to com-
pare the NOCAD patients to the reference group omitting people 
who reported a history of MI, PCI, CABG, or heart failure, those 
without additional information on the presence of cardiovascular dis-
ease, and those who did not further specify cardiovascular disease.
Multivariate analyses split by group were run to examine covari-
ate adjustment for the S&G differences within the NOCAD group 
with the psychosocial outcomes. The threshold for statistical signifi-
cance was set at 0.05.
Results
Baseline characteristics of the study populations stratified for 
men and women are shown in Table 1. Both men and women 
with NOCAD were less likely to have received college edu-
cation; were more often overweight or obese; more often 
reported comorbid hypertension, dyslipidemia, or a history 
peripheral artery disease, transient ischemic attack, or stroke; 
and were more likely to use cardiac medications compared 
with the reference group (Table 1). Men with NOCAD had a 
higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (12%) compared with 
the reference group (7%), but this difference was marginally 
different between women in both groups (12% versus 8%, 
χ2=3.07; P=0.080). Women with NOCAD were less often cur-
rently employed compared with the reference group, which 
was no longer significant after additional adjustment for age 
(findings not shown). No S&G stratified differences between 
the NOCAD group and the reference group were present for 
having a partner and lifestyle factors, including smoking, 
alcohol use, and physical activity (Table 1).
When examining S&G differences within the NOCAD 
group (Table 1, last column), women were on average 3 years 
older, less likely to have a partner, and more likely to be either 
divorced or widowed. Women less often received college 
education and were less often employed compared with men. 
Women reported less alcohol use, but no other differences in 
lifestyle factors, comorbid conditions, or cardiac medication 
use were present between men and women.
S&G Stratified Differences Between the NOCAD 
and Reference Group
Table 2 describes the S&G stratified differences between the 
NOCAD versus the reference group. Both women and men 
in the NOCAD group showed a lower general health status, 
elevated fatigue, more anxiety, more depressive symptoms, 
more NA and less PA, and a higher propensity for Type D 
personality compared with the reference group. There was 1 
exception; in women, SI scores were not significantly differ-
ent between the groups. However, in women, the personal-
ity subtype SI only had a lower prevalence in the NOCAD 
group (11%) versus the reference group (22%), whereas Type

D personality was more prevalent in women in the NOCAD 
group (31%) when compared with the reference group (17%). 
Additional adjustment for age did not alter these main find-
ings (data not shown).
S&G Differences Within the NOCAD Group
Within the NOCAD group, men and women differed on some, 
but not all, psychosocial variables (Table 2). Women with 
NOCAD reported significantly lower physical and mental 
health status, more fatigue, more physical limitation accord-
ing to the SAQ, more anxiety, more NA, and less PA compared 
with men with NOCAD. However, there were no differences 
in reported angina frequency, angina stability, disease percep-
tion, or treatment satisfaction on the SAQ between men and 
women with NOCAD. Neither were significant S&G differ-
ences observed in depressive symptoms, NA of the Global 
Mood Scale, or personality groups within the NOCAD group.
S&G Differences: Interaction by Group
The NOCAD group reported lower health status and more 
psychosocial distress compared with the reference group on 
all variables (data not shown). When examining S&G differ-
ences by group (Table 2: S&G×group interaction, last col-
umn), S&G differences within the NOCAD group were not 
significantly different from S&G differences within the refer-
ence group for any of the patient-reported outcomes. Thus, 
S&G differences were not more pronounced in patients with 
NOCAD when compared with the reference group.
Sensitivity Analyses of CAG and CT Patients With 
NOCAD
Sensitivity analyses were run to further explore the find-
ings stratified for NOCAD based on either invasive CAG 
or noninvasive CT scan. In Table I in the Data Supplement, 
the descriptive characteristics are reported, showing that the

CAG group is more often different from the reference group 
than the CT group. Moreover, S&G differences were more 
pronounced in the CAG group (Table I in the Data Supple-
ment). No S&G×CAG or CT group interaction effects were 
observed (data not shown). Table II in the Data Supplement 
shows health status, psychological distress, and personality 
differences between the reference group with the CAG and CT 
group, respectively. Both men and women in the CAG group 
showed poorer health status, more psychological distress, and 
more Type D personality compared with the reference group. 
These differences were either absent or less pronounced in the 
male CT group and less likely to be present in the female CT 
group when compared with the reference group. Within the 
NOCAD group, S&G differences were more likely to be pres-
ent in the CT group rather than the CAG group. No significant 
interaction effects of S&G×CAG or CT group were observed 
(data not shown).
Additional Analyses Excluding Cardiovascular 
Disease From the Reference Group
In the reference group, 1309 people filled out the question 
on cardiovascular disease absence or presence, of whom 128 
people further specified their condition as an open-ended 
question. In total, 46 (3.4%) people reported a previous his-
tory of MI, PCI, CABG, or heart failure. Additional analyses 
were run comparing the NOCAD group to a selection of the 
reference group (n=1201, 53% women) after excluding people 
with a history of MI, PCI, CABG, or heart failure (n= 46), 
as well as those who did not report the presence or absence 
of CVD (n=38), or who did not further specify their cardiac

conditions (n=62). Exclusion of the group did not alter the 
main findings (data not shown).
The Impact of S&G: Post Hoc Covariate 
Adjustment Within the NOCAD Group
Within the NOCAD group, significant S&G differences 
were present for the covariates age, partner, college edu-
cation, employment, and alcohol use (Table 1). Neither 
of these variables represents random error but rather rep-
resents S&G as well as other individual differences. 
Women are older on average when cardiovascular disease 
emerges, are more often either widowed or divorced, less 
often have received college education, and are less likely 
to be employed compared with men (Table 1). Moreover, 
less alcohol use is reported in women. Multivariate adjust-
ment for these covariates rendered all S&G differences in 
the NOCAD group nonsignificant (Table 3, first column). 
Age, college education, employment, and alcohol use were 
significantly associated with impaired physical health status, 
fatigue, physical limitation, anxiety, PA, and NA (Table 3). 
Having a partner was significantly associated with better 
mental health status, but not with the other psychosocial 
factors. The findings show that these covariates are relevant 
determinants of S&G differences in psychosocial factors in 
patients with NOCAD.
Discussion
Patients with NOCAD reported significantly impaired 
physical and mental health status, more fatigue, anxiety, 
depressive symptoms, NA, a higher propensity for Type D 
personality, and less PA, when compared with an age- and 
sex-matched reference group of the general population. 
Women in the NOCAD group reported poorer physical and 
mental health status, more physical limitation, fatigue, anx-
iety, NA, and less PA compared with men in the NOCAD 
group. No significant S&G differences in the NOCAD 
group were present for angina frequency, angina stabil-
ity, disease perception, treatment satisfaction, depressive 
symptoms, or Type D personality. There were no signifi-
cant S&G by group interactions, showing that the observed 
S&G differences in psychosocial factors were not different 
between the NOCAD and the reference groups. Within the 
NOCAD group, S&G differences became nonsignificant 
when adjusting for age, partner, college education, employ-
ment, and alcohol use, showing the importance of covari-
ates in S&G differences in psychosocial factors in patients 
with NOCAD.
Both men and women with NOCAD report impaired 
health status, more psychological distress, and more Type D 
personality compared with an age- and sex-matched refer-
ence group of the general population, with women reporting 
overall higher levels of impaired health status, psychologi-
cal distress, and Type D personality. These findings are in 
line with the results of 2 previous studies in patients with 
CAD.18,19 Ford et al19 reported impaired health status in 
women compared with men and in patients with CAD com-
pared with people without CAD, but there was no signifi-
cant interaction between sex and CAD for health status. Xie 
et al18 reported impaired health status in patients with CAD 
compared with the NOCAD group and in women compared 
with men. Moreover, women had an impaired physical, but 
not mental, health status in the CAD group.18 Attention for 
women and men with a poor health status is needed because 
impaired health status has been associated with adverse

 7  Mommersteeg et al  Patient-Reported Outcomes in NOCAD: Sex and Gender 
prognosis in patients with CAD.4,6,7 There is currently no 
guideline-recommended therapy for patients with NOCAD, 
other than symptom relief and cardiovascular disease risk 
factor management.2,34
In this study, no S&G differences in patients with NOCAD 
were observed for most health status measures of the disease-
specific SAQ, depressive symptoms, and Type D personality. 
Moreover, whereas patients with NOCAD who were included 
via CAG showed more cardiac risk factors and adverse 
patient-reported outcomes than patients included via CT, sex 
differences were more often present within the CT group. A 
higher cardiac risk factor burden in the CAG group than the 
CT group is in line with the findings by Huang et al.5 The 
absence of S&G differences contrasts findings in patients with 
CAD, showing a higher prevalence of depressive symptoms in 
women compared with men35 and poor disease-specific health 
status according to the SAQ in women compared with men.36 
This discrepancy could be attributed to various factors; CAD 
affects women later in life than men,37,38 and women are more 
likely to have comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and peripheral vascular 
disease.39
Comorbidity can increase disease-specific physical limita-
tions,40 but in our study, the prevalence of comorbid conditions 
was not different between men and women with NOCAD. 
Neither were S&G differences observed in cardiac medica-
tion use, which points toward a similar treatment profile for 
men and women with NOCAD. Moreover, no S&G by group 
interactions were observed, indicating that S&G differences 
may be attributed to the overall S&G differences rather than 
being related to CAD.
Sex refers to biological differences between women and 
men, whereas gender implies the role of social, societal, and 
environmental factors.22,24 On a broad level, there is a multi-
tude of aspects representing diversity of an individual. S&G 
differences in psychosocial factors within the NOCAD group 
were explained by age, partner, employment status, college 
education, and alcohol use. The finding that these covariates 
are associated with psychosocial variables suggests a role for 
gender and other covariates as explanatory factors for differ-
ences in psychosocial variables.
It is noteworthy that in this study, over 1 in 5 women 
(22%) was either widowed or divorced compared with 1 in 
17 (6%) widowed/divorced men. A recent study showed that 
marital disruption was associated with a higher allostatic load 
burden, neuroendocrine pathways which have found to be ele-
vated in cardiovascular disease.41 It remains to be examined 
whether the sex differences observed in this study are pre-
dictive of future cardiovascular events. Psychosocial factors 
have previously been found to be related to adverse outcomes 
in cardiovascular disease,9 but whether these differences are 
consistently different for men and women with NOCAD is 
currently unknown.
The rate of eligible patients willing to participate was 
64%. No information is present for nonresponders, which 
may limit the generalizability of the results toward the 
NOCAD population. It is possible that a volunteer bias has 
been introduced in the reference group, although exclusion 
of people with a possible history of obstructive CAD did 
not alter the main findings. The absence of the SAQ in the 
general population limits the comparability of these find-
ings. Another limitation of this study is that various aspects 
of patient-perceived health are subjectively assessed by self-
report questionnaires.
About half the patients with NOCAD were women 
(52%), which was similar in other studies of patients without 
obstructive CAD (40%–55%).3–5,42 The prevalence of women 
is higher in patients with NOCAD (≈50%) compared with 
studies in patients with obstructive CAD, where women com-
prise ≈25% of the study population. This discrepancy may be 
because of the presence of coronary microvascular disease in 
patients with NOCAD, leading to ischemia in the microvascu-
lature, without the presence of significant obstructions in the 
major coronary arteries.23,43 Routine CAG or CT scans cannot 
detect coronary microvascular disease, although endothelial 
dysfunction and coronary microvascular disease are likely to 
be present in patients with NOCAD.44 Novel techniques will 
need to become incorporated in routine clinical practice to 
distinguish NOCAD with subsequent endothelial dysfunction 
and coronary microvascular disease. It is currently unknown 
whether these patients’ groups report differences in psychoso-
cial functioning.
Clinicians involved in cardiovascular care need to be 
aware that differences in health status between male and 
female patients exist. In spite of evidence that women ben-
efit from the same therapies as men, they continue to receive 
less aggressive therapy, which is reflected in higher healthcare 
resource utilization and adverse health status outcomes.2,22
This study shows that patients with NOCAD have adverse 
health status and more psychosocial distress compared with 
the general population. Women showed impaired health sta-
tus and more psychosocial distress compared with men, 
but these differences were not exclusive for patients with 
NOCAD. Additional adjustment for age, education, partner, 
employment, and alcohol use showed that these other factors 
explained the S&G differences in psychosocial factors in the 
NOCAD group.
