Human-induced rapid environmental change has created a global pandemic of neurobehavioral disor-
ders in which industrial compounds like lead are the root cause. We assessed the feral pigeon (Columba
livia) as a lead bioindicator in New York City. We collected blood lead level records from 825 visibly ill or
abnormally behaving pigeons from various NYC neighborhoods between 2010 and 2015. We found that
blood lead levels were significantly higher during the summer, an effect reported in children. Pigeon
blood lead levels were not significantly different between years or among neighborhoods. However,
blood lead levels per neighborhood in Manhattan were positively correlated with mean rates of lead in
children identified by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene as having elevated blood lead
levels (>10 mg/dl). We provide support for the use of the feral pigeon as a bioindicator of environmental
lead contamination for the first time in the U.S. and for the first time anywhere in association with rates
of elevated blood lead levels in children. This information has the potential to enable measures to assess,
strategize, and potentially circumvent the negative impacts of lead and other environmental contami-
nants on human and wildlife communities.

1. Introduction
Heavy-metal toxicity is a relatively newly identified problem to
human health, with leaded paints and gasoline in widespread use
up until a few decades ago. Despite the banning of most lead-
containing products and abundant information about the hazards
of heavy metals, the negative effects of heavy metals on human
health persist. Lead paint can be found in older buildings, and de-
molitions can increase particulate lead levels in the air by several
hundred times (Farfel et al., 2003). Before the 1990s, leaded
gasoline was used worldwide. It was only prohibited in the United
States in 1995, and even later in many countries. Residues from
gasoline, however, have left lead contaminants on many roads
(García et al., 1988; Hutton and Goodman, 1980; Nam and Lee,
2006; Ohi et al., 1981). This effect is particularly strong on major
roadways or in high-traffic, industrial areas. For example, a study by
Nam and Lee (2006) found that industrial areas in South Korea had
much higher lead concentrations than rural areas due to greater car
traffic and emissions. Despite the introduction of unleaded gasoline
in 1993, lead still contaminates gravel and soil. In addition to
lingering roadside toxicants, lead is still being used in some
airplane fuels, which have been reported to be responsible for the
release of 100 tons of lead into the atmosphere per year (Kessler,

Ever since the discovery of the negative effects of lead on human
health, there have been large-scale attempts to reduce human
contact with lead. The New York City Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene conducts screenings of NYC resident blood lead
levels (2014, 2010). Although blood lead levels have declined in NYC
and the US in the last few decades, that does not mean lead
poisoning is no longer a public health concern. Little is known
about the effects of low amounts of lead on human health, but
recent studies have shown that lead is harmful at all levels eno
matter how lowe affecting intelligence, neurodevelopment, social
skills, and memory (Lanphear et al., 2000; Schnur and John, 2014).
In fact, Canfield et al. (2003) found that at blood lead levels below
10 mg/dl, the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s
national acceptable threshold at the time, the inverse relationship
between IQ in children and blood lead level is even stronger than at
levels above 10 mg/dl. In light of this new information about the
negative effects of low-dose lead exposure, the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention lowered their national threshold to 5 mg/dl
in January 2012.
Lead poisoning is a considerable problem for not only humans,
but wildlife in general. Heavy metals such as cadmium, zinc, and,
most notably, lead are toxic in small amounts to both humans and
feral pigeons (Columba livia) (Cui et al., 2013; Schilderman et al.,
1997; Schnur and John, 2014). Pigeons have been presumed to be
poisoned from a combination of atmospheric and particulate lead;
the former is inhaled from the atmosphere, the latter is consumed.
Because pigeons use small rocks and gravel to aid in mechanical
digestion, they can ingest contaminated road particles, or particu-
late lead (Hutton and Goodman, 1980; Nam and Lee, 2006).
Caravanos et al. (2006) demonstrated that almost 90% of dust
samples taken throughout NYC’s five boroughs exceeded the US
government’s environmental and housing standards for acceptable
lead concentration. Dust containing lead from the outdoors can be
brought into households by regular foot traffic or air drifting, which
can increase human exposure (Caravanos et al., 2006).
In the last few decades, feral pigeons have received considerable
attention as possible bioindicators for heavy-metal exposure. Pi-
geons have a longstanding association with humans that dates back
to establishment of the first permanent agricultural settlements.
Feral populations have since spread across the world and exist in
almost all the different kinds of communities where people live,
nesting on top of buildings and along building facades, under
bridge overhangs, and on top of garage roofs (Gompertz, 1956;
Humphries, 2008). Consequently, feral pigeons have thrived in
NYC, where they have even been labeled as pests, with such
monikers as “rats with wings” (Jerolmack, 2008; Humphries, 2008).
The combination of densely-packed buildings, an abundance of
food, and ample greenery, such as that found in Central Park, make
NYC an ideal feral pigeon habitat. Compared to many other urban
organisms, the pigeon’s relatively long lifespan and hardiness,
combined with its close relationship to humans, make it a suitable
bioindicator, offering up the potential to gauge adverse environ-
mental conditions that may affect humans and other wildlife
(Drasch et al., 1987; Liu et al., 2010; Schilderman et al., 1997). The
urban pigeon does not only walk the same pavement and live on
the same blocks as humans, it also breathes the same air and often
eats the same food. In this situation, the pigeon can serve as the
proverbial canary in a coal mine.
Studies of pigeons as heavy-metal bioindicators from South
Korea, China, Tokyo, Spain, France, the Netherlands, and the UK
have indicated clear physiological differences between pigeons
living in environments with varying amounts of heavy metals (Cui
et al., 2013; Frantz et al., 2012; García et al., 1988; Hutton and
Goodman,
1980;
Nam
and
Lee,
2006;
Ohi
et
al.,
1981;
Schilderman et al., 1997). Pigeons exhibit a high level of site fidel-
ity to birth sites, generally remaining in a small area (<2 km) for
their entire lives (Rose et al., 2006). This behavioral characteristic
thus permits comparisons of pigeon lead toxicity among micro-
urban environments (Frantz et al., 2012). For example, Frantz
et al. (2012) measured heavy-metal concentrations in feral pigeon
feathers in the urbanized region of Paris, France, and found that the
levels contrast sharply between neighborhoods. Despite interna-
tional attention on the pigeon as a bioindicator, as well as reports
and studies investigating high lead level concerns in NYC residents
and their environments (Caravanos et al., 2006; New York City
Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2014, 2010; Schnur
and John, 2014), the feral pigeon to our knowledge has never
been the subject of a lead bioindication study in the United States.
We investigated blood concentration levels of lead in 825 feral pi-
geons suspected of lead poisoning and collected across different
neighborhoods and seasons in NYC over a period of five years
(2011e2015). We also examined the relationship between pigeon
blood lead levels per neighborhood in Manhattan as compared to
mean rates of lead in children identified by the NYC Department of
Health and Mental Hygiene as having elevated blood lead levels
(>10 mg/dL; 2014). We provide support for the use of the feral pi-
geon as a bioindicator of environmental lead contamination and in
association with rates of elevated blood lead levels in children
living in NYC.
2. Materials and methods
Since 2011, citizen scientists have been collecting visibly ill or
abnormally behaving feral pigeons throughout New York City and
admitting them to the Wild Bird Fund, the only wildlife rehabili-
tation center in the city. Wildlife rehabilitators routinely sample
blood from patients upon their admission via femoral vein punc-
ture. Trained rehabilitators then measure and record lead levels in
the blood using a LeadCare® II portable anodic stripping voltam-
metry (ASV) device.
With permission of the Wild Bird Fund, we analyzed these data,
which included: assigned ID number, the location of the pigeon’s
collection, the date that blood level was tested, and their blood lead
level in mg/dl if it fell within range detection (3.3e65.0 mg/dl). The
location of the pigeon’s collection was classified into neighbor-
hoods according to the New York State Department of Health (New
York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2014). The
majority of pigeons admitted to the Wild Bird Fund were from
Manhattan. Thus, we concentrated our analyses on neighborhoods
within this borough, though we incorporate areas from other
neighborhoods within NYC boroughs that offered sufficient data,

 including Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Smaller neighborhoods
and/or areas with fewer than 10 data points were combined with
directly adjacent neighborhoods. We assigned seasons from dates
by using respective annual season equinox dates as cutoffs. In total,
we compared the blood lead levels of 825 pigeons collected during
the Fall, Winter, Spring, or Summer from 13 New York City neigh-
borhoods from January, 2011, to March, 2015.
We performed statistical analyses using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago,
USA). We used Levene’s test to assess equality of variances in our
blood lead level data. If data lacked homoscedasticity, we used an
appropriate transformation to meet the assumptions of a linear
model. We conducted a univariate general linear model to examine
if year (2011e2015), season (spring, summer, fall, winter), and/or
neighborhood (N ¼ 13) explained pigeon blood lead levels
(N ¼ 825). When we parsed data into neighborhood per season per
year, sample sizes were too small to examine interaction effects
with confidence. Also, we could not examine potential sex effects,
as pigeons are not sexually dimorphic and rehabilitators did not
determine sex through other methods (such as sex genotyping or
laparotomy). Thus, we solely investigated year, season, and neigh-
borhood as potential explanatory variables of pigeon blood lead
levels. Pending a statistically significant model result (P < 0.05), we
conducted Tukey’s post-hoc analyses to examine pairwise re-
lationships, which were deemed significant at P < 0.05. We report
sample sizes in Table 1. In addition, we conduced a Pearson’s cor-
relation analysis to assess the relationship between the mean blood
lead levels in pigeons per Manhattan neighborhood and the rates of
children identified with elevated blood lead levels as reported by
the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygeine (2014). We
determined a significant result at P < 0.05.
3. Results
Levene’s test revealed that blood lead level data did not meet
the assumptions of variance equality (F51,773 ¼ 1.666, P ¼ 0.003).
Log-transformed data showed no statistical difference in variance
(F51,773 ¼ 0.787, P ¼ 0.858) and were used for further analyses.
A general linear model examining the effect of year, season, and
neighborhood on blood lead levels was statistically significant
(F165,659 ¼ 1.338, P ¼ 0.007). Post-hoc tests revealed that blood lead
levels were higher in the summer (x� ¼ 22.311 mg/dl) as compared
to the fall (x� ¼ 16.224 mg/dl, P ¼ 0.003) and winter (x� ¼ 17.795 mg/
dl, P ¼ 0.001; Fig. 1). Year (Fig. 2) and neighborhood did not
significantly predict blood lead levels (all statistical results are re-
ported in Supplementary Materials). However, in general, pigeons
from the Soho/Greenwich Village neighborhood had on average the
highest levels of lead in their blood (x� ¼ 23.121 mg/dL), followed by
pigeons from Lower Manhattan/Lower East Side (x� ¼ 22.708 mg/

correlational analysis revealed that pigeon blood lead levels in
Manhattan neighborhoods positively correlate with rates of chil-
dren in those neighborhoods identified with elevated blood lead
levels (r ¼ 0.647, N ¼ 8, P ¼ 0.042; Fig. 5).
4. Discussion
We report that significant differences in New York City feral
pigeon blood lead levels are apparent across seasons. Blood lead
levels are highest in summer months as compared to fall and
winter months, a phenomenon previously reported in children
(Johnson and Bretsch, 2002, Haley and Talbot, 2004). Although
levels did not statistically differ significantly by neighborhood, on
average, lead circulating in the blood was in highest concentrations
in the neighborhoods of Soho/Greenwich Village, Lower Manhat-
tan/Lower East Side, and Upper West Side as compared to other
neighborhoods examined. These relative levels of toxicity are
positively correlated with reported relative rates of toxicity in
children by the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygeine
(2014).
4.1. Lead and seasons
Seasonal variation in children’s blood lead levels has been
documented, with levels peaking during the summer months
(Johnson and Bretsch, 2002, Haley and Talbot, 2004). Mean blood
lead concentrations in the summer in NYC pigeons were also
significantly higher than those during the fall and winter. This
suggests that either 1) lead levels in the city are higher in the
summer, 2) feral pigeons are more active in the summer and are
exposed to greater amounts of atmospheric and/or particulate lead,
3) pigeons are able to incorporate lead more quickly into soft tissue
or bone in the summer, or 4) a combination of these factors.
Lead levels in children may be higher in the summer due to
increased activity outside accompanied by higher temperatures,
which can lower the humidity of soil e soil that can contain par-
ticulate lead (Laidlaw et al., 2005). Solid matter that is less damp is
easily re-suspended in the air, where it can be more easily accessed
via inhalation or touch. During the winter months, particularly in
the northeast U.S., frozen ground and snow cover may lessen such
exposure (Johnson and Bretsch, 2002; Yiin et al., 2000).
Another explanation may be that in many avian species,
including the pigeon, basal metabolic rate changes between
seasons (McKechnie, 2008; Saarela and Vakkuri, 1982). Feral pi-
geons increase metabolism during the winter to account for lower
temperatures (McKechnie, 2008). This increase in BMR could result
in faster incorporation of lead into the body resulting in lower
levels of lead circulating in the blood. However, further research
must be conducted before drawing any conclusions about the effect
of BMR on heavy metal processing in the avian system. In summary,
whatever the cause may be for seasonal changes in blood lead
levels in pigeons and children, sampling blood during the fall and
winter months may not be representative of the peak level expe-
rienced or total amount of annual lead exposure.
4.2. Lead and neighborhoods
The lead concentrations of sick birds collected throughout NYC
neighborhoods ranged from an average of 12 mg/dl (Central/South
Bronx) to almost double that in some neighborhoods (Soho/
Greenwich Village and Lower Manhattan/Lower East Side). Rates of
children reported as newly identified with elevated blood lead
levels of 10 mg/dl or greater in NYC were also higher in those living
in Soho/Greenwich Village and Upper West Side as compared to
other areas of Manhattan, North Queens and Central/South Bronx
(New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2014).
Circulating lead in the blood has negative effects on human health
and development at amounts as low as or below 10 mg/dl (Canfield
et al., 2003; Schnur and John, 2014; Lanphear et al., 2000), and thus
these levels in both pigeons and humans are cause for concern.
Heavy trafficked areas in midtown and downtown Manhattan
may be the cause of high lead blood levels in NYC pigeons living in
these areas. An NYC 2008e2009 Community Air Survey and the
New York City Department of Transportation indicate heavy traffic
density exists in midtown and downtown Manhattan (2011).
Heavily trafficked areas have been suggested as the culprit for lead
or, post the ban of its use in gasoline, residual lead particulate
(Drasch et al., 1987; García et al., 1988; Hutton and Goodman, 1980;
Johnson et al., 1982; Nam and Lee, 2006; Ohi et al., 1981).
Other potential sources of lead toxicants include deteriorating
paint and lead dust accumulation, which can increase lead loading
on streets, sidewalks, and alleys during demolition and particulate
lead in polluted water and on the ground, including on the soil
(Caravanos et al., 2006; Farfel et al., 2003). Deteriorating paint on
steel structures and railways in NYC can also increase lead loading
in soil and dust (Weiss et al., 2006). House dust and soil lead con-
centrations are strongly associated with child blood lead levels, and
soil lead concentrations may have an even greater impact on lead
toxicity than lead paint (Duggan, 1980; Mielke and Reagan, 1998).
Atmospheric lead is also a common source, though it may account
for only a very small portion of lead ingested by humans and pi-
geons (Duggan, 1980; Mielke and Reagan, 1998).
Whatever the source(s) may be causing lead toxicity in our
subjects, there exists a parallel between high blood lead levels in
the pigeons sampled and high rates of children with blood lead
levels of 10 mg/dl or more in some NYC neighborhoods. Because of
this, and the fact that pigeons and humans exhibit the same sea-
sonal variations in blood lead levels (Johnson and Bretsch, 2002,
Haley and Talbot, 2004), we present evidence for the use of the
feral pigeon as a bioindicator of environmental lead contamination
and human health in New York City.
5. Conclusion
Pigeons co-inhabit the built environment with humans all over
the globe. They are exposed to many of the same environmental
contaminants as humans, and often, they suffer similar health
consequences. Outside of the U.S., pigeons have been successfully

levels in neighborhoods in Manhattan with rates of children (per 1000 tested) younger

 used as heavy-metal bioindicators. However, a study using the pi-
geon model as a bioindicator for lead has never, to our knowledge,
been conducted in the U.S. Furthermore, to our knowledge, no
study has investigated or corroborated the link between pigeon
blood lead levels and those of children seasonally or living in the
same neighborhoods. Here, we offer all three and provide a
powerful example of how monitoring pigeon biology may help us
to better understand the location and prevalence of lead, with the
aim of providing greater awareness and devising prevention mea-
sures. This is an increasingly timely and important topic as new
findings reveal that even miniscule amounts of lead are extremely
detrimental to child health, and that lead is still a health concern to
many communities in the United States and beyond (Lanphear
et al., 2000; Canfield et al., 2003; Schnur and John, 2014).
