Hydraulic fracturing and infant health: New evidence
from Pennsylvania
Janet Currie,1,2* Michael Greenstone,2,3 Katherine Meckel4
The development of hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) is considered the biggest change to the global energy produc-
tion system in the last half-century. However, several communities have banned fracking because of unresolved
concerns about the impact of this process on human health. To evaluate the potential health impacts of fracking,
we analyzed records of more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013, comparing infants born to
mothers living at different distances from active fracking sites and those born both before and after fracking was
initiated at each site. We adjusted for fixed maternal determinants of infant health by comparing siblings who were
and were not exposed to fracking sites in utero. We found evidence for negative health effects of in utero exposure
to fracking sites within 3 km of a mother’s residence, with the largest health impacts seen for in utero exposure
within 1 km of fracking sites. Negative health impacts include a greater incidence of low–birth weight babies as well
as significant declines in average birth weight and in several other measures of infant health. There is little evidence
for health effects at distances beyond 3 km, suggesting that health impacts of fracking are highly local. Informal
estimates suggest that about 29,000 of the nearly 4 million annual U.S. births occur within 1 km of an active fracking
site and that these births therefore may be at higher risk of poor birth outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
The growth in unconventional gas production involving hydraulic
fracturing (“fracking”) has transformed the energy landscape, redu-
cing energy prices, decreasing conventional air pollution by displacing
coal in electricity generation, disrupting international energy trading
arrangements, and increasing the prospects for energy self-sufficiency
for the United States. At the same time, continuing concerns about the
possible local health effects of hydraulic fracturing have led some
states and communities to ban the practice altogether. The absence
of a systematic evaluation of fracking’s health effects has complicated
the decision process for those governments around the world who are
debating whether to allow hydraulic fracturing.
Hydraulic fracturing could affect human health through several
channels, including water and air pollution. In the fracking process,
water and other chemicals are forced into shale rock to fracture it
and allow the gas or petroleum trapped in the shale to be tapped.
Whereas much of the previous research has focused on water pollution
(1–3), several recent studies address the possible effects of chemicals
that have been found in both “fracturing fluid” (the fluid that is forced
into the shale in order to fracture it) and in air emissions near fractured
gas wells (4–6). One study measured various air pollutants weekly for a
year surrounding the development of a newly fractured gas well and de-
tected nonmethane hydrocarbons, methylene chloride (a toxic solvent),
and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, which have been shown to affect
fetal outcomes (7).
There are at least two reasons to focus particularly on infant health
in probing the health effects of exposure to hydraulic fracturing. First,
there is increasing evidence that the fetus is vulnerable to a range of
maternal pollution exposures (8–13). Second, because the fetus is in
utero for at most 9 months, it is possible to pinpoint the timing of
potentialexposure. Thisisnot the casewithotherpossible healtheffects,
such as cancer, that develop over long periods of time. Moreover, birth
data are available with precise information on mothers’ residential lo-
cations, permitting researchers to examine the effects of proximity to
fracturing sites on the health of newborns.
This paper provides evidence for impacts of hydraulic fracturing
on human health, based on a large-scale analysis of vital statistics re-
cords from more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania during the
period 2004–2013. Our empirical approach compares infants born to
mothers living at different distances from hydraulically fractured well
sites, both before and after hydraulic fracturing was initiated at the
well site. In addition, we probe the robustness of the results by adjust-
ing the estimates for maternal fixed effects to include comparisons of
siblings who were exposed to fracking with those who were not. Further,
we explore the relationship between infant health outcomes and resi-
dential distance from fracturing sites, comparing birth data from
mothers residing at increasing 1-km intervals from the fracturing sites
to investigate whether there is a gradient in the effects of exposure.
The results of our analysis suggest that the introduction of fracking
reduces health among infants born to mothers living within 3 km of a
well site during pregnancy. For mothers living within 1 km, we find a
25% increase in the probability of low birth weight (birth weight <
2500 g) and significant declines in average birth weight and in an
index of infant health. There are also reductions in infant health for
mothers living within 1 to 3 km of a fracking site, but the estimates are
about one-third to one-half of the size of those within the 0- to 1-km
band. There is little evidence of health effects at further distances, sug-
gesting that health impacts are highly local.
This paper addresses four problems that have plagued the previous
literature (14–16). First, the sample size of this analysis is much larger
than that used in previously published work. Second, in addition to
examining low–birth weight status, which is the most commonly used
measure of infant health in the literature, we use an index of infant
health outcomes informed by the literature on multiple hypothesis
testing (17, 18) to incorporate the many other measures of infant
health that are available in the vital statistics data. Third, we test for
effects at various distances of maternal residence from fracking sites,
rather than imposing one arbitrary assumption about the distance
where health impacts may become apparent, or about the functional
form of the distance gradient.

 An additional innovation is that our models control for mother
fixed effects. Estimates of fracking-independent aspects of maternal
health in these models are controlled by comparing the health of
fracking-exposed and unexposed siblings born to the same mother.
In principle, this comparative technique controls for all the unobserved
time invariant characteristics of the mother such as racethat couldcon-
found conventional difference-in-differences estimates (that is, before
and after comparisons of places with and without fracking). However,
in practice, the mother fixed effects estimates are imprecise because
there are relatively few sibling pairs with an exposed and an unexposed
sibling even when we are examining all Pennsylvania births.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Figure1showsboththegeographicaldistributionofbirthsinPennsylvania
from 2004 to 2013 and the locations of fractured wells across the state.
The greatest number of births occurs in the southeast of the state near
Philadelphia, whereas fractured wells follow the state’s shale deposits
along a diagonal path from the northeast to the southwest of the state.
Although many areas with fracturing are lightly populated, the areas
surrounding Pittsburgh have a high population density in addition to
many fractured wells. Figure 2 illustrates the temporal distribution of
fractured wells, showing that most new wells came online after 2009.
Although the number of new wells peaked at the beginning of 2012,
the amount and economic value of gas production continued to grow
over our sample period.
Table 1 explores differences in maternal characteristics, infant
characteristics, and health outcomes between mothers who were po-
tentially exposed to fracturing and those who were not. The first two
columns show variable means for mothers whose residences were less
than 1 km from a location (or multiple locations) that fractured.
Columns (3) and (4) report the means for births to mothers who live
within 3 to 15 km of a well location. These samples are further divided
into those whose infants were born before the spud date (that is, the
commencement of drilling)—thus, never exposed to fracking—and
those whose babies were born after the spud date. When the mother
is within 1 km of multiple locations, we use the earliest spud date to
align with the approach used in the regression analysis.
The remaining columns, (5) to (7), report P values from tests that
the means are equal across the pairs of columns indicated in the row
headings. These tests help shed light on the credibility of different
approaches to measuring the infant health effects of fracking exposure.
Column (5) reports P values for t tests of the hypothesis that the means
are equal within 0 to 1 km of a well location before and after the spud
date. These comparisons indicate that mothers whose babies were po-
tentially exposed to nearby fracturing in utero are younger, less likely
to have been married at the time of the birth, and less educated—
characteristics that might lead to worse infant health outcomes even in
Fig. 1. Locations of births and fractured wells in Pennsylvania. Each square displayed above is 0.25° latitude by 0.25° longitude. We use all birth certificates in
Pennsylvania for 2004–2013. They include maternal address which is used to calculate average yearly births per square. Black triangles represent the exact locations
of fractured wells, which we observe from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) Internal Operator Well Inventory. These data include all oil
and gas wells with a Pennsylvania DEP drilling permit and which are not currently filled in (plugged). We queried this database in November 2014. Fractured wells are those
marked “unconventional” in the database. We have dropped any wells with missing American Petroleum Institute numbers, spud or permit date, or location information.

 the absence of fracturing. Column (6) reveals that there are also signif-
icant changes in the characteristics of infants and mothers who live 3 to
15 km from a fractured well site after the spud date, relative to before.
One of the most marked differences is that the fraction of births to black
mothers is much lower in this distance category after fracturing begins
(and the fraction of births to white mothers is correspondingly higher).
This difference arises because over time, more wells were drilled near
urban areassuchasPittsburgh, where highernumbersof African Amer-
icans live.
A potentially valid approach to estimating the effects of fracturing
is to use a difference-in-differences estimator that compares “before
versus after” in the area near fracturing to “before versus after” in areas
far from a fracturing site. This approach requires that all determinants
of infant health except fracturing evolve identically in the areas near
and far from fracturing. Column (7) provides an opportunity to gauge
the credibility of this approach. It reports the P value from a test of the
hypothesis that the difference between the column (1) and (2) means
is equal to the difference between the column (3) and (4) means. The
results show that using difference-in-differences reduces the potential
for confounding fracking exposure with other determinants of infant
health, but important differences in the evolution of marriage rates,
race, education, and age remain. Although we control for all the observ-
able factors in our models, these differences suggest that there may also
be unobserved differences across areas in other factors that could influ-
ence infant health. This observation motivates the inclusion of mother
fixed effects in the equation of outcomes as a function of potential expo-
sure to a fractured well as shown in Eq. 2 (see Materials and Methods).
Figures 3 and 4 provide an opportunity to investigate the rela-
tionship between distances from a fracked well and measures of
infant health. These figures are based on estimation of Eq. 1 (see
Materials and Methods), except that “Near” is treated as a vector of
indicators for each 1-km distance increment from a well site, as

production per well is recorded by the Pennsylvania DEP in its Oil and Gas Historical
Production Report. We merge these data to our Internal Operator Well Inventory data
by well identification number and then sum gas production to the year level. To con-
vert production to dollars, we use gas prices from the U.S. Energy Information Ad-
ministration (EIA), which reports the Henry Hub Natural Gas Spot Price (www.eia.gov/

values for Pennsylvania are taken from the EIA.

certificates in Pennsylvania (2004–2013) matched to the Pennsylvania DEP
Internal Operator Well Inventory. Maternal and infant demographic indi-
cators and health outcomes are recorded at the time of birth. “Near, 0–
1 km” indicates that the mother lives within 0 to 1 km of at least one well
site. “Far, 3–15 km” indicates that the mother lives 3 to 15 km from the
nearest well site. Columns (5) to (7) report P values from t tests of equality
of means across the different samples indicated. Column (7) tests whether

 described above. The unaffected group is composed of births to
mothers living more than 15 km away from a well site. The figure
also shows the number of births in each distance category.
On the basis of these figures, we conclude that any significant
effects of fracking exposure occur within 3 km of a well site. It is also
evident that the largest effects are concentrated within 1 km of the
fracking site. For example, Fig. 3 shows that the coefficient on the
indicator for maternal residence within 1 km of a site is approximately
0.01, indicating a 0.01 percentage point increase in the probability of
low birth weight relative to people who live 15 km or more away from
a site. The effect of living 1 to 2 km from a site is near zero, but the
effect of living 2 to 3 km from a site again appears to be positive. Figure 4
suggests that the infant health index is worse at 0 to 1 km from a fracking
site than at higher distances. There is some unavoidable arbitrariness
in defining the cutoff at 3 versus 4 km; however, it is nevertheless ev-
ident from our data that there is little justification for including births
at further distances in the potentially affected group.
Table 2 reports the results that emerge from the estimation of
Eqs. 1 and 2. The first three columns use 0 to 1 km as the definition of
“Near,” the next three columns use 1 to 2 km, and the last three columns
use 2 to 3 km. In each case, the unaffected group is mothers who live 3 to
15 km from a site. Hence, we compare mothers at 0 to 1 km to mothers
at 3 to 15 km, mothers at 1 to 2 km to mothers at 3 to 15 km, etc. In each
group of three columns, the first column reports results from fitting
Eq. 1 on the entire sample. In columns (2) and (3), the sample is
restricted to births from mothers who live within 15 km of a well site,
and these columns report on results from Eqs. 1 and 2, respectively.
Each row corresponds to a different birth outcome, so that each entry
in the table is a separate estimate of coefficient a2. Note that because the
omitted group is held constant in the regressions (it is always the
mothers who are greater than 3 km and less than 15 km from a site),
the regressions are not directly comparable to Figs. 3 and 4. In Table 2, the
standard errors are clustered by mother. We have also estimated alter-
native models clustering by county, which yields very similar patterns.
Column (1) suggests that maternal residence within 1 km of an
active well site that was hydraulically fractured before conception is as-
sociated with significantly worse infant health outcomes than are more
distant locations. The estimated effect on the probability of low birth
weight is large (0.016), relative to the baseline mean incidence of low
birth weight of 0.065. We also estimate a small but statistically signif-
icantnegative effect onmean birth weight of about 39 g. Itis quitecom-
mon in the pollution and health literature to find a larger effect of
pollution on low–birth weight incidence than on average birth weight
(10–13); this finding is consistent with the possibility that any effects
are concentrated among lighter, likely more vulnerable,infants. Finally,
the infant health index also suggests a relatively small but statistically
Fig. 3. Effect of fracturing on low–birth weight, county fixed effects. The left
y axis of the graph indicates coefficients and confidence intervals (CIs) from a version
of Eq. 1 in which “Near” is replaced with 15 distance indicators representing the prox-
imity of maternal residence to well sites; the coefficients represent the in utero effect
on infant health of hydraulic fracturing (that is, when conception occurs after well
spud date) at 1-km intervals from the well site. The data sources for the regression
are all birth certificates issued in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the Pennsylvania
DEP Internal Operator Well Inventory. We exclude births with missing values for ges-
tation length or latitude/longitude of maternal residence. We calculate the distance
between maternal residence and well sites using Vincenty’s formula. The specification
includes year fixed effects (FE), month of birth FE, and county of maternal residence FE.
The following demographic controls are also included: mother is married, marital sta-
tus missing, maternal race and ethnicity (black, Hispanic, missing), maternal educa-
tion [no high school (HS), HS diploma, some college, college, advanced degree,
missing], maternal age (<20, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35+, missing), child is male,
child sex missing, and child parity (first, second, third, fourth born and higher, parity
missing). Standard errors are clustered on maternal ID. The right y axis plots average
yearly births at each distance from a well site.

 significant decline in health; the coefficient of −0.054 means that births
near a well site where hydraulic fracturing began before conception
have a −0.054 standard deviation decline in the health index. Limiting
the sample to births to mothers living within 15 km, as shown in col-
umn (2), has little effect on the estimates, despite the sharp reduction in
sample size.
Column (3) reports the estimates from fitting the mother fixed
effect specification (that is, Eq. 2) on the 15-km sample. The inclusion
of mother fixed effects is very demanding of the data, a circumstance
reflected in SEs, which are about twice as large as those in columns (1)
and (2); this increased SE arises because, within the 0- to 1-km range,
only 594 of the 1798 potentially exposed infants [see column (2) of
Table 1] have an unexposed sibling in the data. At 2 to 3 km,
10,568 infants are potentially exposed and 3538 have a sibling in the
data—a better statistical situation than the 0- to 1-km cohort, but still a
tiny fraction of the overall number of births. The pattern of the coeffi-
cients remains qualitatively similar, particularly for the incidence of
low birth weight.
The remaining columns report on the same three specifications,
except that to test the robustness of our results to different definitions
of “Near,” the “Near”groupisdefined asthose living within a 1-to 2-km
radius of a well site in columns (4) to (6) and a 2- to 3-km radius from a
site in columns (7) to (9). These estimates indicate negative health
effects from fracking, although they are smaller than in the 0- to 1-
km range. For example, the estimated effects on the incidence of
low birth weight and on the infant health index are about one-third
to one-half of the effect size in the 0- to 1-km category. The effects on
birth weight are smaller and statistically insignificant. When maternal
fixed effects are added to the models, the estimates are qualitatively
similar, although generally somewhat smaller, but the increase in the
SEs means that these estimates are not statistically significant by
conventional criteria.
We additionally conducted a series of robustness checks. A potential
concern is that the analysis is based entirely on a list of wells that were
active in 2014 and that therefore does not include hydraulically
fractured wells that were no longer active as of that date. These wells
were not included because the well data set includes the spud date for
these wells but does not report when the well became inactive. Hence,
our baseline analysis could underestimate exposure if the wells were
active during a woman’s pregnancy but shut down sometime after an
infant’s birth. As a check, we reestimated the models using the full
sample of wells, active and inactive; the results are essentially unchanged
as shown in table S2.
A further issue is that we have assigned “Exposure” on the basis of
whether conception occurred after the spud date. Hence, there are
some women for whom drilling occurred during a pregnancy that
began before the spud date, and these women are treated as not having
been exposed. If these women were negatively affected, then the esti-
mates may understate the health effects of fracturing. Conversely, if it
is exposure in the earliest days of the pregnancy that matters, then the
impacts will be smaller for infants who were only exposed later in the
pregnancy, and adding these infants to the “exposed” sample will re-
duce the estimated effects. Therefore, we reestimated the models de-
fining “Exposure” on the basis of whether the birth (rather than the
conception) occurred after the spud date. Table S3 reveals that these
estimates are generally slightly smaller than those in Table 2, suggest-
ing that infants exposed early in the pregnancy may suffer the most
harm; however, the sampling variability makes definitive judgments
difficult.
We have also tried adding additional controls for area interacted
with year to allow for secular changes in infant mortality that vary at a
very local level. Specifically, because counties are of varying size, we
overlaid a grid based on 0.5° of longitude and 0.5° of latitude over
the state of Pennsylvania and estimated a model that included an
Table 2. Effect of fracturing on infant health. Each coefficient and SE (shown in parentheses) is from a different regression and represents the effect on
the given infant health outcome of in utero exposure to fracturing (when conception occurs after well spud date) within the indicated distance. The data sources for
the regression are all birth certificates issued in Pennsylvania from 2004 to 2013 and the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well Inventory. We calculate the
distance between maternal residence and well sites using Vincenty’s formula. The infant health index ranges from 0 to 1; an increase indicates better health.
Each regression specification includes region of maternal residence*year FE, year*month of birth FE, and county of maternal residence FE. The following demographic

 indicator for the square in which the mother resides interacted with
year of conception. These results are shown in table S4 and are qual-
itatively unchanged, compared to those discussed above.
In table S5, we attempt to investigate the effects of intensity of ex-
posure in the area within 1 km of a residence. For mothers living within
1 km of a well site, the median number of well sites is 2. Hence, we alter
our main specification to distinguish between the effect of having at
least one active well and the effects of having more than two active
wells. This is a demanding test of the data, and we are unable to reject
the null hypothesis that the effects are equal for births exposed to above
the median and below the median number of wells.
Finally, the probability of a low–birth weight birth is only 6.5% in
this sample. Of relevance to this point, all the estimates have come
from linear probability models; given the relatively low mean, it
may be more appropriate to rely on nonlinear estimation approaches.
Table S6 reports the marginal effects from logit estimation of Eq. 1 on
the 15-km sample and finds that the results are qualitatively similar to
those from the linear probability model in Table 2.
CONCLUDING REMARKS
This paper provides evidence of effects of exposure to hydraulic
fracturing on infant health, using a large-scale analysis of vital statistics
records from more than 1.1 million births in Pennsylvania during the
2004–2013 period. Overall, the results suggest that the introduction of
fracking reduces health among infants born to mothers living within 3 km
of a well site during pregnancy. We find the largest effects for mothers
living within 1 km of a site—a 25% increase in the probability of a low–
birth weight birth (<2500 g) and significant declines in average birth
weight, as well as in an index of infant health. There are also reductions
in infant health for mothers living within 1 to 3 km of a fracking site, but
the estimates are about one-third to one-half of the size of those for
mothers within the 0- to 1-km band. There is little evidence of health
effects at further distances, suggesting that health impacts are highly local.
What do these estimated impacts imply for the affected infants?
Studies based on large administrative databases have consistently shown
that low birth weight is a risk factor for numerous negative outcomes,
includinginfantmortality,attention deficithyperactivitydisorder,asthma,
lower test scores, lower schooling attainment, lower earnings, and higher
rates of social welfare program participation (19, 20). For example, one
large-scale study of twinpairs in Norway found that a 10% difference in
birth weight in their predominantly low–birth weight pairs was asso-
ciated with a 1% difference in the probability of graduating from high
school and a 1% difference in earnings, with outcomes all being better
for the higher-weight twin (20).
Are these effects large or small relative to those found in other stud-
ies? Many other studies examine the effects of exposure to criterion air
pollutants, such as carbon monoxide or nitrous oxides, rather than the
specific types of hazardous air pollutants that have been noted near some
fracking sites (4–7). For example, a study of the installation of EZ Pass
toll plazas in New Jersey and Pennsylvania showed that EZ Pass was
associated with reductions of 40% in CO and 11% in NO, which in turn
reduced the incidence of low birth weight by 12% among mothers liv-
ing within 2 km of a toll plaza (13). A recent study of openings and
closings of industrial plants that emit hazardous air pollutants, such as
benzene (one of the chemicals that has been found near fracking sites),
suggested that plant operation is associated with a roughly 3% increase
intheincidenceoflowbirthweightamongmotherswithin1.6km(1mile)
oftheplants(12).Thus,thispaper’sestimatedfindingsofa25%increasein
the probability of a low–birth weight birth within 1 km and smaller effects
at larger distances are not inconsistent with the findings that have been
reported in previous studies of the effects of air pollution on fetal health.
Available data sources allow for some rough estimates of the num-
ber of births in the United States annually that are at risk from fracking.
Specifically, we combined data from the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) on the number of births by county from July 2012
through June 2013, with data on the number of fractured wells in 2012
from HPDI, an information services company in the energy industry.
The NCHS data are only available by county (whereas our Pennsylvania
birth data have women’s exact addresses), but by assuming a uniform
distribution of population across counties, we can estimate the number
of births to women within 1 km of an active well that was hydraulically
fractured in that year. Although the HPDA data do not have a fracking
indicator, we infer it by using information on which wells are in tight oil
or shale gas plays; hydraulic fracturing is generally required for the ef-
ficient recovery of oil and gas in these areas. These calculations suggest
that as many as 65,000 infants were potentially exposed nationally in
this 1-year period because their mothers live within 1 km of a well site
that is likely to have been fractured.
The superior data available in Pennsylvania allow us to compare
the estimated number of births exposed to the actual number of in-
fants exposed to fracking during gestation. This comparison suggests
that the assumption of a uniform distribution of births across counties
leads to substantial overestimates of the number of infants born within
1 km of an active well site that was fractured; presumably, this is be-
cause fracking occurs in less populated parts of counties where there
are fewer births per square kilometer. When we scale our national
estimate downwards using the ratio of estimated to actual exposed
births for Pennsylvania, we estimate that approximately 29,000 U.S.
infants were exposed (that is, born to mothers living within 1 km of
an active well that was fracked) between July 2012 and June 2013. This
is about 0.7% of the infants born in the United States over that period.
A limitation of our study is that given the nature of the available
data, we are constrained to focus on potential exposure to pollution
(which is determined by the mother’s residential location) rather than
actual exposure that could be measured with personal monitoring de-
vices. In principle, future research could measure the types and
amounts of chemicals emitted by hydraulic fracturing, the distance
that those chemicals are transported under normal weather
conditions, and the likely effects of those specific chemicals on fetal
health and on the health of children and adults.
A second limitation of our study is that even starting with the
whole population of Pennsylvania births, we end up with a relatively
small sample of children who were potentially exposed to fracking;
this small effective sample size limits our ability to probe the shape
of the distance-exposure relationship and also limits our ability to ob-
tain precise estimates from models with mother fixed effects.
A third caveat is that the pathway of exposure was not a subject of
our study and is not known with certainty. The results of our study are
consistent with the possibility that very local air pollution, perhaps
from the multiple diesel generators used at well sites, from chemicals
used in fracking, or even from truck traffic to and from sites, could be a
potential key source of exposure. Previous research regarding human
health effects of exposure to hydraulic fracturing has also identified
contaminated water as a possible pathway. Although industrial activity
from hydraulic fracturing and improper disposal of fracturing fluids
can affect water quality, recent analyses suggest that it is not common
for fracturing fluids to leak into surface water from the fractured well

 sites (1, 2). Tighter regulation of fluid disposal and fracturing activities
may have mitigated threats to water quality; nevertheless, this potential
avenue for deleterious effects on human health effects also deserves
careful monitoring.
A fourth caveat is that, to the extent that there are economic
benefits of fracking that accrue to women who live less than 1 km from
a fracking site, our estimates could understate the specific effects of
fracking exposure on human health. If, for example, women living
near wells receive income from mineral rights, then the higher income
per se could be expected to confer a health benefit, which might par-
tially offset the negative effects of fracking-related pollution.
Finally, future research should focus on a richer set of outcomes, in-
cluding child health at older ages and adult health. These outcomes can
be difficult to track, but creative uses of administrative data may provide
compelling opportunities to more thoroughly investigate the local
health consequences of exposure to hydraulically fractured well sites.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this project came from two sources. First, data on all births
in Pennsylvania were obtained from the Certificate of Live Births (birth
certificates) from 2004 to 2013. These data include a record for every
birth, and each record has information about the infant’s health at birth
as well as latitude and longitude of the maternal residence and maternal
characteristics such as race, education, and marital status. Because we
used confidential data, our study protocol was vetted by PrincetonUni-
versity’s Institutional Review Board. Siblings were matched using the
mother’s full maiden name, race and birth date, as well as father’s
information, and social security numbers where available.
There are many possible health outcomes listed on birth certificates,
several of which represent rare outcomes. In what follows, we focus on
birth weight and low birth weight (birth weight less than 2500 g), which
are the most commonly examined measure of fetal health outcomes in
the environmental economics literature. Birth weight is commonly
examined because it has been the most widely available measure, it is
relatively accurately measured, and low birth weight is quite common
unlike conditions such as specific congenital anomalies, for example.
We also show estimated effects on a composite infant health index
that is constructed to have a mean of 0 and an SD of 1, with positive
(negative) values indicating above (below) average infant health
(measured in SDs). Our index is suggested by the literature on multiple
hypothesis testing (17, 18). If there are k outcomes and Yk is the kth,
then let mk be the mean and sk be the SD. We normalize our outcomes
by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SE: Yk* = (Yk − mk)/sk. The
summary index is then Y* = SkYk*/K. We construct two versions of this
summary index, one using the full sample of births and one using the
subsample of births within 15 km of a well. The index is the mean over
the standardized outcomes, weighted by the inverse covariance matrix
of the transformed outcomes to ensure that outcomes that are highly
correlated with each other receive less weight than those that represent
new information.
The index is a combination of birth weight in grams and indicators
for low birth weight, prematurity (gestation less than 37 weeks), the
presence of any congenital anomalies, and the presence of any other
abnormal condition of the newborn. The index provides a solution to
the challenges to inference from separately examining the multiple
measures of infant health (that is, “multiple hypothesis” testing).
The problem is that the probability that at least one estimated effect
is deemed “significant” increases with the number of tests. Focusing
on an index avoids this difficulty. The index is defined so that a larger
value indicates more positive health.
We focus on a sample of singleton births because twins and other
multiples are generally in poorer health at birth for reasons unrelated
to hydraulic fracturing. After excluding births with missing
information, we are left with an initial birth sample of 1,125,748 births,
of which 270,410 are within 15 km of a site where a fractured well was
active in 2014. From the initial sample of 1,449,427 births, we lose the
following: 55,337 births that were part of a multiple birth; 25,029 births
that were missing values for gestational age, birth weight, congenital
anomalies, or abnormal conditions of the newborn; 226,548 births that
were missing latitude and longitude; 41,789 births missing a maternal
identifier; and 146 duplicate records. The sum of the missing categories
above exceeds the number of cases lost because some cases are missing
more than one set of variables.
The second source of data is a list of all of the fractured wells that
were active in 2014 in the Pennsylvania DEP Internal Operator Well
Inventory (21). Fractured wells are those marked “unconventional” in
the database. For each well, we know the location and the date (month
and year) that it was fractured. There are 7757 active fractured wells in
our data, the vast majority of which were fractured after 2009. Below,
we show that the focus on active wells, rather than all fracked wells,
does not alter the results.
To match births to fractured gas wells, we computed the distance
from the mother’s residence to all locations where fracturing ever took
place between 2004 and 2013, regardless of whether the fracturing had
yet occurred at the time of the conception. Distances were computed
using Vincenty’s formula for calculating the distance between two
points on a sphere. In our sample, there are 24,148 births to mothers
residing less than 2 km from a site where fracturing ever occurred and
6669 living within 1 km of a site where fracturing ever occurred; of this
last group, 1798 births were potentially exposed to active fracturing at
some point while in utero, because the conception date occurred after
the date that drilling was initiated (that is, the spud date).
We estimate several different statistical models with and without
sibling comparisons. Some models are estimated using the entire sam-
ple of Pennsylvania births, whereas others focus only on births within
15 km of a well site. The latter sample excludes births in Philadelphia,
for example, where there is no fracturing and birth outcomes may be
changing differentially from those in the rest of the state for reasons
unrelated to the proliferation of fracturing.
The first specification that we estimate is
Yit ¼ a0 þ a1Neari þ a2Exposureit þ a3Xit þ a4Countyit
þ a5Timeit þ a6Regional trendit þ eit
ð1Þ
where Yit is a birth outcome for mother i in year t. Countyit is a vector
of zero-one indicators for the mother’s county of residence at the time
of the birth, Timeit is a vector of zero-one indicators for the birth
month and year (for example, October 2006), and Regional_trendit
is a region-specific linear time trend based on a division of Pennsylvania
into six regions (22). The vector Xit of observable maternal and child
characteristics includes indicators for child gender, maternal race and
ethnicity (African-American, Hispanic, missing), mother’s age (<20,
20 to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35+, missing), mother’s education (<high
school, high school, some college, college, advanced degree, missing),
marital status (including an indicator for missing marital status), and
child parity (first, second, third, fourth born or higher, parity missing).

 One reason for controlling for parity is that in our data, the exposed
sibling tends to be younger than the unexposed siblingin a sibling pair,
so that it is important to control for birth order effects.
To develop our measure of exposure, we first define two vectors for
each birth, each of which contains a separate element/variable for each
well site observed in the data. The “proximity” vector consists of
indicator variables for each well site regardless of whether it had been
fractured at the time of the birth. These indicators are equal to 1 if the
distance between maternal residence and the given well site is within a
short distance (that is, 0 to 1, 1 to 2, or 2 to 3 km in alternative speci-
fications) and 0 otherwise. We then define an indicator, Neari, that is
the result of applying the maximum operator to the full vector for
birth i. That is, if there are any wells within the specified radius, then
this indicator Neari will take the value 1 and 0 otherwise. This variable
is a practical solution to summarizing the information on distance as-
sociated with each of the nearly 8000 wells; specifically, it is a measure
of whether there is at least one well in the relevant distance category
and it is a key covariate in Eq. 1.
The “timing” vector also has a separate indicator for each well that
is equal to1 ifconception occurred after the spud date and 0 otherwise.
The idea is that it is implausible that a well could affect infant health
before it is spudded. The differences in spud dates across wells, even
with relatively small geographic areas, mean that it is possible to in-
clude month-year indicators and region-specific time trends to adjust
for any underlying time effects.
Having defined these two vectors, we multiply to create a new
vector and apply the maximum operator to the product vector. The
result is the indicator variable Exposureit, which is equal to 1 for births
near any well sites for which the spud date precedes conception and is
equal to 0 otherwise. Thus, after adjustment for the full set of covariates
described in the preceding paragraphs, the key parameter of interest is
a2, which measures whether there are changes in infant health near well
sites where hydraulic fracturing started before the conception date.
One reason why birth outcomes might differ in an area before and
after fracking is that the population of mothers may change with active
fracturing. Previous work has shown, for example, that housing prices
can be affected by industrial activity (12, 23, 24), which could be
expected to change the population living nearby over time. One way
to deal with this problem is to compare each mother to herself. Hence,
we next estimate
Yit ¼ ai þ a1Nearit þ a2Exposureit þ a3X′
it þ a4Countyit
þ a5Timeit þ a6Regional trendit þ eit
ð2Þ
which differs from the study of Bamberger and Oswald (4) in that it
includes a constant term for each mother, ai. Because the ai absorbs
the effect of any constant or time invariant characteristics (that is, race,
education, etc.) of the mother, the vector X′it now includes only time-
varying elements of Xit. Table S1 reveals that mothers with multiple
births are more likely to be married and also more likely to have either
highorlowlevelsof education. Hence, althoughEq. 2removesconcerns
about confounding fracking exposure with other determinants of infant
health, it is possible that the effects of exposure to fracking differ in the
subpopulation of mothers with more than one child in the data.
Three additional details are worth noting. First, there was no a
priori correct way to define “Near” because there is no physical law
that determines the distance at which fracking-related activities poten-
tially affect infant health. Consequently, we estimated models that ex-
plore the effect of each additional kilometer of distance from a well.
These models took the same form as Eq. 1, except that “Near” was
replaced with a vector of indicators for whether the mother lived 0
to 1, 1 to 2 km, 2 to 3, …, 10 to 15 km from a well. The omitted distance
category was greater than 15 km. A mother’s residence can be both 0
to 1 km from one well and 2 to 3 km from another; hence, these
categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive. We also calculated
15 “Exposure” variables analogously to the way these indicators were
described above; the coefficients associated with these variables test for
any changes in infant health in these 15 distance bands around well
sites where hydraulic fracturing started before the conception date,
relative to the rest of Pennsylvania. We found little evidence of an
effect of fracking exposure on infant health at distances greater than
3 km, and this motivated our focus on 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 km as
the definitions of “Near,” as well as the use of infants born to mothers
living more than 3 km away as the comparison group.
A second issue is that secular trends in infant health outcomes may
differ across small geographic areas (that is, because of hospital closings
or openings or local economic shocks). For this reason, the subsequent
analysis reports result from the estimation of versions of Eqs. 1 and 2
that limit the sample to a 15-km radius around a well site. The advan-
tage of this smaller sample is that mothers living 3 to 15 km away from
a well site may be affected by the same economic shocks as those who
live within 3 km. In contrast, this assumption seems less likely to be
valid for mothers living further away, for example in Philadelphia. In
addition, rather than only allowing time trends to vary by region, we
also defined a 0.5° latitude × 0.5° longitude grid and controlled for a
time trend for eachcellinthis grid. Thisalternate specification provides
a flexible method to adjust for secular changes in infant health that are
unrelated to fracking exposure.
All models were estimated using the REG and XTREG commands
in STATA 14.0. The SEs in these and all our models were clustered by
mother to allow for correlations between siblings in other determinants
of birth outcomes.
