 Understanding lay perspectives on socioeconomic health
inequalities in Britain: a meta-ethnography

Abstract
The links between socioeconomic circumstances and health have been extensively
studied in Britain but surprisingly few studies consider lay perspectives. This is
problematic given popular efforts to reduce health inequalities appear to be based
on assumption that public understanding is limited (this is evident in efforts to
raise awareness of both ‘upstream’ causes of health inequalities and health-
damaging behaviours). The results of this meta-ethnography, involving 17
qualitative studies, fundamentally challenge this assumption. We show, first, that
people who are living with socioeconomic disadvantage already have a good
understanding of the links between socioeconomic hardship and ill-health. Indeed,
participants’ accounts closely mirror the research consensus that material-structural
factors represent ‘upstream’ determinants of health, while ‘psychosocial’ factors
provide important explanatory pathways connecting material circumstances to
health outcomes. Despite this, people living in disadvantaged circumstances are
often reluctant to explicitly acknowledge health inequalities, a finding that we
suggest can be understood as an attempt to resist the stigma and shame of poverty
and poor health and to (re)assert individual agency and control. This suggests that
work to increase public awareness of health inequalities may unintentionally
exacerbate experiences of stigma and shame, meaning alternative approaches to
engaging communities in health inequalities discussions are required.

Introduction
A large, cross-disciplinary body of research demonstrates the significant association between
socioeconomic disadvantage and poor health experiences in Britain (Marmot 2010, Smith
et al. 2016). This continually growing literature has informed an explicit recognition that
socioeconomic health inequalities are socially produced; meaning they are considered by many
researchers and policymakers to be avoidable, unfair and unjust (Whitehead 2007); all of
which inspires a desire to intervene (Garthwaite et al. 2016). Yet, while post-1997 policy ini-
tiatives have seen Britain labelled as a global leader in policy efforts to reduce health inequali-
ties (Mackenbach 2011), most indicators suggest either that health inequalities have continued
to widen (see Mackenbach 2011) or that progress has been extremely limited (Bambra 2012).
There is some agreement (Garthwaite et al. 2016) that this failure reflects a policy preoccu-
pation with trying to change people’s behaviours (improving diets, reducing alcohol intake,

 etc.), while available evidence highlights the importance of ‘upstream’ (material, structural)
determinants and suggests that efforts to change people’s behaviours often exacerbate health
inequalities (Whitehead 2007). Mackenbach (2011) argues that the dissonance between
research and policy at least partially reflects the fact that policymakers did not believe they
had a public mandate for the kinds of ‘upstream’ policies that research evidence suggests is
required. In her interviews policy actors, the lead author of this article previously reached simi-
lar conclusions but noted that it was unclear how policy actors were assessing public opinion
about health inequalities since they themselves often commented on the lack of evidence on
this topic (Smith, 2013). In this context, the lead author (Smith, 2013) criticised health
inequalities researchers for not sufficiently incorporating community voices in their research
and for seeking to effect change (on the public’s behalf) via an elitist approach that involves
directing messages towards what Weiss (1990: 9) calls the ‘ubiquitous benevolent despot, the
decision maker’, rather than via more democratic approaches. More seriously, Heath (2007:
1301) has charged researchers with participating in the creation of a health inequalities ‘indus-
try’ in which affluent researchers ‘piggyback’ on the distress of the poor as ‘a substitute for
difficult political effort – opium for the intellectual masses’.
Where researchers do attempt to engage the public in debates about health inequalities in
Britain, such efforts appear to be disseminative in nature, broad in scale and informed, at least
to some degree, by an assumption that public understanding is limited. Innovative and creative
examples include Bambra’s (2015) football ‘league-tables’ of inequalities between urban cen-
tres in England and McCartney’s (2011) metro map of health inequalities in Glasgow. The
limited survey based-research (which is only included in our meta-ethnography where it was
accompanied by more in-depth, qualitative data) provides support for such efforts, finding that
the British public tend to under-estimate the extent of health inequalities (Macintyre et al.
2005) and downplay material, structural and environmental causes of poor health (Blaxter
1997, Popay et al. 2003a, 2003b). However, as this meta-ethnography demonstrates, sociologi-
cal studies provide a rather different perspective on public understandings of health inequali-
ties.
Drawing on 17 in-depth, qualitative studies this review asks three, linked questions (which
were developed on the back of earlier scoping reviews that simply asked what studies tell us
about lay understandings of health inequalities (Smith 2013)). The first two questions were our
guiding analytical questions, which we asked of each study included in the meta-ethnography:
(i) how do people living in Britain understand the links between socioeconomic circumstances
and health?; and (ii) to what extent do people acknowledge the existence of health inequalities
in Britain? The third question, which we explore towards the end of the paper, emerges out of
the analysis we present and this is to ask what the implications of these findings are for health
inequalities research and public engagement. In sum, the findings demonstrate the value of
sociological enquiry in this area, challenging: (i) the need for further descriptive research, ana-
lysing the ‘problem’ of health inequalities (since there appears to be a strong consensus
between epidemiological and lay perspectives about the causes of health inequalities); and (ii)
the merit, ethics and impact of efforts to raise public awareness of health inequalities (given
the risks of exacerbating shame and stigma). Instead, we outline some alternative approaches
to research and engagement.

 acknowledge/speak about health inequalities. We conducted a systematic search of seven aca-
demic databases (ASSIA, EBSco, which included EconLit and CINAHL Plus, Embase, which
included PsychINFO and Medline, IBSS, PubMed, Sociological Abstracts and Web of
Science). The main search string, which was developed iteratively and refined following feed-
back from colleagues, combined the names of methodological approaches deemed likely to
capture lay perspectives with terms relating to socioeconomic disadvantage and health, as fol-
lows: (‘focus group*’ OR interview* OR deliberative OR survey OR ethnograph*) AND (dis-
advantage* OR poverty OR depriv* OR poor OR inequ*) AND (health OR suicid* OR
depress* OR anxi* OR cancer OR cardiovascular OR ‘heart disease’ OR stroke OR diabetes).
We also tried to limit searches to studies written in English, published in peer-reviewed
sources and focusing on the UK or sub-regions in the period from 1997 onwards (i.e. the point
at which tackling health inequalities became a clear policy priority). We did not include stud-
ies that had a specific focus on a particular behavioural risk factor (e.g. diet or smoking) or ill-
ness (e.g. cancer), although we had included these studies in an earlier, rather broader scoping
review, since we wanted to capture people’s broad accounts of the links between socioeco-
nomic circumstances and health. The specific approaches to searching varied by database,
depending on available options (e.g. where databases had geographical options as filter, we
used those but, in other cases, we added relevant terms to the search string). Between them,
these searches resulted in 24,876 hits, each of which was assessed for relevance (using title
and, where necessary, abstract) by KS, a process which was cross-checked by RA.
This preliminary analysis identified 36 articles which were downloaded and read in full by
KS, who identified 10 as meriting inclusion in the review. RA again cross-checked this pro-
cess and identified a further two papers for inclusion. KS checked the reference lists of these
12 articles for further relevant publications and used citation tracking tools to help identify
newer articles. This process garnered an additional seven relevant publications. We then
checked our results against a recent international review of qualitative research on health
inequalities (Elliott et al. 2016) which identified one additional publication (Bolam et al.
2006) linked to a study that was already included. This resulted in the inclusion of 20 publica-
tions in total, which covered 17 distinct studies (three studies had been written up twice and in
all three cases we opted to analyse the publications collectively, since there were significant
overlaps across the papers). Where authors had written non-peer reviewed and peer-reviewed
publications from the same study, we only included the peer-reviewed publication since these
were the ones we were most easily able to access and share.
Informed by, Noblit and Hare’s (1988) ‘meta-ethnography’ approach to reviewing qualita-
tive studies, we only included in-depth, sociological studies. We also decided to restrict our
geographical focus to the UK, in light of Noblit and Hare’s (1988) caution regarding the
appropriateness of considering studies across contrasting cultural settings. A rapid review of
the international evidence base on this topic, conducted by Elliott et al. (2016), suggests that
the literature in this area is, in any case, dominated by UK studies and that those undertaken
elsewhere vary greatly in contextual setting (Australia, Bangladesh, Ireland, Japan, New Zeal-
and, Sweden and the USA). Table 1, which summarises the geographical location and method-
ological approach of the 17 studies, shows that most included studies were based on
interviews or focus groups, with a smaller number using other qualitative methods and only
two studies (one of which was written up as two publications) employing a mixed methods
approach (Popay et al. 2003a, 2003b, Vassilev et al. 2014). Table 1 summarises the geograph-
ical focus of included studies (since no studies focused on Northern Ireland, our review focus
became Britain).
The earliest included study was published in 2001 (Cattel 2001) and the most recent in
2016 (Mackenzie et al. 2017 - first published online in 2016). This means that, over our

 20-year search period (1997–2016), we identified an average of less than one study per year,
affirming the low level of research on this topic (Elliott et al. 2016). An overview of all 17
studies is provided in Table 2. Given the difficulty of searching for a relatively broad set of
criteria (and the multiple potential search terms), it is possible that we missed some relevant
studies (our choice of databases means we are particularly likely to have missed book chapters,
PhD theses and grey literature). Nonetheless, the reference mining and citation tracking we
undertook helped address some of these limitations and demonstrated that many included stud-
ies cited each other, suggesting that we had managed to identify the most relevant peer-
reviewed studies.
We chose not to assess the quality of included studies and instead relied on peer-review as
a marker of sufficient quality for inclusion. This decision reflects existing critiques of applying
quality appraisal check-lists to qualitative studies (e.g. Barbour 2001) and because of a con-
cern, when experimenting with applying Critical appraisal skills programme (CASP)
(Public
Health Resource Unit 2015), that studies we deemed to be high-quality were receiving low
scores due to a lack of methodological information (rather than because of definitive flaws).
Having identified the 17 studies (20 publications) summarised in Table 2, we worked to
synthesise the findings, using an approach informed by Noblit and Hare’s (1988) guidance on
undertaking meta-ethnography. This involved KS chronologically reading each of the publica-
tions several times to gain an in-depth understanding of the key findings regarding our two,
linked questions. This initial analysis led us to conclude that, of the three types of synthesis
associated with meta-ethnography, a ‘line of argument’ approach was most appropriate. As
Noblit and Hare (1988: 62) put it, ‘A line of argument synthesis is essentially about inference:
What can we say of the whole [. . .] based on selective studies of the parts?’ In other words,
our original aim was to ascertain how people living in Britain, particularly those in disadvan-
taged circumstances, understand health inequalities, based on our interpretation of 17 in-depth
studies exploring how specific communities and groups within Britain understand health
inequalities.
Our intention had been that we would then identify all relevant examples of what meta-eth-
nographers refer to as ‘first order constructs’ (participants’ accounts and interpretations of their
experiences) and ‘second order constructs’ (authors’ views and interpretations of participants’
accounts). However, like Atkins and colleagues (2008), we immediately found ourselves strug-
gling to distinguish between the two since the amount of original data included in most of the
studies was so limited that the author(s)’ decision to include these particular small sections
(over others) meant we felt these extracts were more akin to ‘second order’ constructs. Reflect-
ing this, we decided to focus only on identifying second order constructs (treating the small

 extracts of original data that most publications included as ‘second-order’ by virtue of the
authors’ decision to include them).
Having made this decision, we first identified all potentially relevant second order constructs
relating to our two, linked questions. We then considered how the second order constructs
identified in each study could be translated to those in others, a process which involved group-
ing similar constructs into broad interpretative categories and, where necessary, iteratively edit-
ing the wording of these categories to enable very similar constructs to be merged. In practical
terms, this translation process was initially undertaken on hardcopies of the publications (in
note form), before employing tables created in Word. In addition, for constructs categorised as
relevant to lay explanations of the links between socioeconomic circumstances and health, KS
produced a hand-drawn diagram illustrating the links between constructs within each study.
KS also worked to combine these diagrams and, while the end result was deemed too complex
to be of use to readers, it played an important role in our analysis, providing a source against
which to check emerging findings. RA then read each study once to cross-check KS’s analysis,
at which point a small number of studies were identified as making brief mentions of second
order constructs KS had not identified.
Findings
This analysis allowed us to produce Table 3, which: (i) takes a temporal approach to order our
overarching interpretative categories of second order constructs, from initial socioeconomic cir-
cumstances, through health experiences, to potential for change; (ii) provides readers with
some quantifiable evidence regarding the number of studies in which we identified specific
second order constructs (within each interpretative category, constructs identified in the great-
est number of studies are listed first and those that appeared in the fewest, last); and (iii) uses
colour-shading to thematically cluster the constructs according to broad sets of popular,
research-informed theories for explaining health inequalities (informed by Bartley 2004 and
Smith et al. 2016). In producing this table, we focused first on (i), then (ii), with the thematic
colour-shading representing the final stage. Since Table 3 is complex, we developed Figure 1
as a simplified, visual summary of the tabulated information.
Taken together, the included studies demonstrate that people in Britain, or more specifically
people in Britain experiencing socioeconomic deprivation (who were the main focus of all of
the included studies), have a complex and dynamic understanding of the ways in which
socioeconomic circumstances impact on health (see Figure 1 and also Parry et al. 2007). In
this section, we begin, by discussing what the studies reveal about lay understandings of the
relationship between socioeconomic circumstances and health, before moving on to consider
factors and experiences that emerged as potential agents of change (either ‘amplifying’ health
impacts or providing some form of ‘resilience’ or resistance). These two sections build directly
on Table 3 and Figure 1. In the final sub-section, we go beyond Table 3 to consider how and
why participants resisted ideas about the existence of health inequalities (despite their evident
understanding of the impact of socioeconomic circumstances on health).
Lay understandings of the ways in which socioeconomic circumstances impact on health
Our decision to distinguish between ‘initial conditions’ and ‘secondary factors’ in Table 3
reflects a consistent pattern across the studies in which authors and their participants described
initial conditions to which they attributed both direct health impacts and indirect health
impacts (as we describe below, with reference to housing).

 Of the various initial conditions identified as important in studies, employment opportunities
and experiences seemed to play the most fundamental role in people’s lives, with multiple
implications for health. Reflecting this importance, accounts of the closure of major commu-
nity employers were often emotive, as the following extract, taken from an interview with a
woman living in the Welsh valleys, illustrates:
Well the first link to go was the mines. But that was ok after a while, it was devastating for
the miners. That was ok really because then some of ‘em could get work here. In the steel-
works. Some people moved away but a lot of ‘em came back as well. A lot of the miners
came back and the second chain, the second link in the chain was British Steel. When it
was announced it was closing. And to me that was a death knell in the town. (‘Martha’
quoted in Walkerdine 2010: p.111)
Where communities experience multiple large employer closures, these changes not only threa-
ten people’s livelihoods and incomes but also particular ways of life, and the impacts tend to
be multiplicative (Garnham 2015, Mackenzie et al. 2017, Rind and Jones 2015, Roberts 2009,
Walkerdine 2010). Many older participants, for example, spoke with nostalgia about the days
in which large employers were at their height, emphasising the strong social ties that this way
of life facilitated – the ‘buzz of people’ (Terry, oral history participant, quoted in Garnham
2015) – as well as employers’ investment in local facilities, such as sporting amenities and
parks (e.g. Rind and Jones 2015).
When large-scale employers closed, participants reflected that this triggered a breakdown of
social connections and the emergence of a collective sense of hopelessness. The resulting
worklessness reduced community wealth, increased stress and lowered living standards (e.g.
Garnham, 2015). At a more individual level, participants who had lost jobs reported feeling
that they had experienced a consequential decline in their perceived social status, ‘daily mean-
ing’ and structure, as well as material income (Vassilev et al. 2014).

 When combined with an increasingly minimal and heavily regulated welfare support system
(evident in the more recent studies), several participants described feeling pushed into jobs that
they considered to be damaging for their mental health, with ‘call centre’ work singled out as
a particularly pernicious example by a GP working in Easington (Roberts 2009). As Macdon-
ald and Shildrick note, when reflecting on the employment opportunities experienced by many
of their young participants:
This was not employment that was based on terms and conditions, formal or informal, or
which was notable for the fair or compassionate treatment of workers (for example, paid
sick leave was rarely available). [. . .] They are more likely to encounter work that generates
ill health and face a stronger likelihood of speedy expulsion back to unemployment when
they suffer ill health. (MacDonald and Shildrick 2013:151)
Many of the participants and study authors attributed this situation to the political and eco-
nomic decisions of local and national policy actors and this then contributed to a sense that
these communities were being treated unfairly, to the benefit of others (Cattel 2001, Garnham
2015, Mackenzie et al. 2017, Rind and Jones 2015, Roberts 2009, Walkerdine 2010). This
informed a common perception that those in positions of power had deliberatively neglected
certain areas (or, at the very least, given preferential treatment to affluent areas):
In all of the focus groups, there was a perception of neglect and that ‘authorities’ did not
listen to or understand residents’ needs [. . .]. We did not prompt discussion on inequalities
or seek comparisons with other areas. However, among young people in all three areas there
was explicit recognition that ‘other’ areas were better than where they lived. Participants
questioned the fairness of this. (Parry et al. 2007:130)
Complaints of poor quality, limited, local shops and facilities (e.g. play parks), combined with
limited transport options, were linked by participants to low exercise (Backett-Milburn et al.
2003) and poor diets (Popay et al. 2003b). While poor quality housing (high rise flats, in par-
ticular) was linked to feelings of hopelessness, depression, social isolation and/or a sense of
being uncared for (Bolam et al. 2004, Cattel 2001, Davidson et al. 2008, Garnham 2015,
Parry et al. 2007, Popay et al. 2003b, Watson and Douglas 2012). Participants explained that
both the direct, negative emotional and physical consequences of poor quality living environ-
ments, and the difficulties facing those attempting to improve conditions, contributed directly
to experiences of depression:
If you open your door and it’s full of rubbish and what have you, it makes you feel
depressed, you know. (‘Margaret’, low SES participant living in Greater Glasgow, quoted in
Davidson et al. 2008: 174)
The amount of times I’ve been so depressed because of the way the house is has been unbe-
lievable, that’s their fault. I begged for help, they never gave me it. (‘Jane’, low SES partici-
pant living in Greater Glasgow, quoted in Davidson et al. 2008: 176)
Poor housing was also identified as a source of shame and stigma, leading to feelings of being
unsafe and contributing to arguments within the household (Parry et al. 2007) and an unwill-
ingness to have friends and family over (Davidson et al. 2008), while additionally contributing
to some forms of chronic ill-health (Bolam et al. 2004, Davidson et al. 2008).

 All of the initial conditions mentioned so far have a connection to income but, interestingly,
few participants explicitly linked income to health. Rather, people tended to focus on a wide
range of material and financial resources that combined to contribute to poor living and work-
ing environments, stress and anxiety and which were exacerbated when debt was involved
(Watson and Douglas 2012). These experiences informed people’s sense of not having many
choices/options available (Bolam et al. 2004) and feelings of stigma and guilt (e.g. not being
able to afford to provide treats for children or, in some cases, to provide adequate food and
clothing) (Parry et al. 2007). In one study, a participant called ‘John’ reflected that, prior to
the introduction of the minimum wage, he had been told by one of his bosses that he was
earning less than the security dogs he worked alongside (Mackenzie et al. 2017). His account
illustrates how low wages can contribute directly to low self-esteem and fuel people’s sense of
injustice. Reflecting this, Vassilev and colleagues’ (2014) study of 300 GP patients with long-
term conditions found that access to material resources (particularly income and wealth) played
a central role in the way that people assessed their social status.
Across the studies, as Figure 1 highlights, participants commonly referred to key psy-
chosocial pathways as important explanations for the ways in which they felt the initial (lar-
gely material-structural) conditions they lived and worked in impacted on their health. The
most common psychosocial pathway linking socioeconomic deprivation to poor mental
health outcomes was stress (Backett-Milburn et al. 2003, Bolam et al. 2004, Cattel 2001,
Davidson et al. 2006, 2008, Garnham 2015, MacDonald and Shildrick 2013, Parry et al.
2007, Popay et al. 2003a, 2003b, Roberts 2009, Walkerdine 2010, Watson and Douglas
2012). Stress was described in ways that suggested it contributed directly to depression, anx-
iety, panic attacks and anger and indirectly to social isolation (e.g. via family arguments)
and poor decision-making (e.g. around managing limited finances or consumption of harmful
products).
While stress was the most frequent psychosocial experience to be mentioned, ‘fear’
appeared to be one of the most damaging and often related to previous negative social interac-
tions, including, for example, being the subject of violence (including racial, gender-based,
sexual and drug and alcohol fuelled violence), other criminal acts (Cattel 2001, MacDonald
and Shildrick 2013, Parry et al. 2007, Roberts 2009, Watson and Douglas 2012) or, more
broadly, disrespect or discrimination. This, in turn, could lead to people feeling uncared for
(Burningham and Thrush. 2003, Watson and Douglas 2012) and, in some cases, keen to avoid
interactions with the public services intended to provide a basic (‘safety net’) level of support
(Garnham 2015).
Other important psychosocial factors identified in the studies include shame and stigma
(Cattel 2001, Davidson et al. 2006, 2008, Garnham 2015, Mackenzie et al. 2017, Parry et al.
2007, Popay et al. 2003a, 2003b, Watson and Douglas 2012) and, in fewer studies, ‘anger’
(Cattel 2001, MacDonald and Shildrick 2013). These feelings were, in turn, commonly con-
nected to concerns about feeling ‘judged’, ‘disrespected’ and labelled as ‘poor’ (Watson and
Douglas 2012, Vassilev et al. 2014). In most cases, these experiences were described in ways
that suggest they interacted with one another, with negative consequences for health. Shame,
stigma and fear, for example, were described as directly impacting on mental health but also
combining to fuel unhealthy behavioural responses, including a perceived need to spend
money on items that could not really be afforded (e.g. to ensure children looked ‘smart
enough’ so that neighbours would not report them to social services for neglect – Cattel
2001). It is worth noting, however, that anger and a sense of injustice were occasionally
referred to in ways that suggested these experiences could be positive for health (e.g. in
instances where it had caused participants to work collectively to try to challenge the source
of the perceived problem (Cattel 2001, Davidson et al. 2008)).

 The other frequently mentioned pathway linking people’s living and working conditions to
their health was ‘lifestyle behaviours’, with health-damaging behaviours often being described
by participants and authors in ways which suggested they were a rational (even inevitable)
response to difficult circumstances, coping mechanisms or forms of escapism:
[I]t is possible to theorise the attraction of heroin, at least in part, as a form of self-medica-
tion to numb psychic pain and ameliorate ‘ill-being’. (MacDonald and Shildrick 2013: 150)
[P]eople are always going to buy cakes, it’s just the pills of life. They eat cakes and biscuits
and sweets and so on, that taste nice so they make you think of different things’ (female
resident of an inner city estate in Greater Glasgow, quoted in Davidson et al. 2008: 176)
Such an account was used by one of Dolan’s (2007) interviewees to explain why local initia-
tives to reduce drug-related crime were unlikely to work without efforts to change the wider
circumstances, particularly in terms of employment:
Like when they come in an say, ‘Right we’re going to clear you of drugs’. OK. That’s
great. But we say what are you going to replace it with? If you take something away, you
have to replace it with something else. Work isn’t here, so you can’t replace it with work.’
(Bob, 39, resident of a non-affluent area in Coventry, quoted in Dolan, 2007: 487).
In the context of both these kinds of within-study accounts of policy failures and the research
consensus that post-1997 policy efforts to reduce health inequalities in Britain have failed, the
following sub-section focuses on considering what studies suggested about the potential to
alter the impacts of material and structural circumstances on health.
Factors with the potential to ‘amplify’ or provide ‘resilience’ to negative health impacts
The wide arrows to left and right of Figure 1 capture factors that were described as either ‘ampli-
fying’ the negative health impacts of difficult socioeconomic circumstances (left-hand arrow,
Figure 1) or providing a sense of resilience or resistance (right-hand arrow, Figure 1). Categoris-
ing second-order constructs as one or the other was not necessarily clear-cut with, for example,
critical life events and anger being described in ways which suggested that they could sometimes
serve to increase people’s sense of hopelessness and, potentially, their use of alcohol and drugs,
but, at other times, provide triggers for people to change damaging patterns (e.g. Macdonald and
Shildrick 2013). Likewise, as Figure 1 illustrates, while most studies suggested that strong social
networks (where available) provide some resilience to factors that might otherwise impact
negatively on health, a small number of cases highlighted how tightly-knit networks of people
sharing experiences/circumstances could exacerbate negative experiences or may make it harder
to ask each another for help (e.g. shared bereavement or limited resources – see Cattel 2001).
It is clear that many of the factors identified as having the potential to change the way in
which people’s living and working conditions impact on their health (for better or worse) are
difficult (in some cases impossible) to change at an individual level or even, perhaps, a single
policy level. Participants’ accounts also support the idea that negative experiences can be
cumulative, making it increasingly difficult over the lifecourse for people living in deprived
circumstances to respond positively to the complex web of negative influences captured in Fig-
ure 1. ‘Health selection’, in which poor health limits a person’s income (e.g. via the jobs that
it is possible to do) played a role in this, with some participants attributing their exit from the
labour market to ill-health (MacDonald and Shildrick 2013).

Understanding lay perspectives on socioeconomic health inequalities in Britain
163
 To what extent do people explicitly acknowledge socioeconomic health inequalities?
The above accounts suggest that lay understandings of the multiple and intersected ways in
which socioeconomic circumstances impact on health is closely aligned to research-informed
theories of health inequalities researchers (Bartley 2004, Marmot 2010, Smith et al. 2016),
highlighting the importance of both material and structural conditions and psychosocial path-
ways. Yet, across the seven studies that explicitly considered what people thought about
‘health inequalities’, participants repeatedly resisted their existence. With the odd exception in
three studies (Davidson et al. 2008, Mackenzie et al. 2017, Parry et al. 2007), participants
seemed more comfortable discussing socioeconomic inequalities than health inequalities (Back-
ett-Milburn et al. 2003, Cattel 2001, Parry et al. 2007). More commonly, participants denied
the existence of health inequalities or acknowledged them only with reluctance (Airey 2003,
Backett-Milburn et al. 2003a, Bolam et al. 2004, Davidson et al. 2006, 2008, Popay et al.
2003).
This appears to represent something of a paradox (though one that occurred within several
studies, rather than between different studies, so a paradox we explored but not one for which
we employed meta-ethnography’s ‘refutational’ analysis, since that focuses on exploring con-
tradictions between studies): participants appeared to understand the multiple, complex path-
ways between socioeconomic circumstance and health and yet deny (or resist) the logical
consequence of these unequal experiences. The studies provide a variety of explanations for
this apparent paradox, all of which relate to experiences of stigma and shame. First, partici-
pants were concerned and on occasion angered by negative images of the place they regarded
as home (Airey 2003, Burningham and Thrush. 2003, Parry et al. 2007), sometimes interpret-
ing potentially derogatory labels associated with their place of residence, as attacks on them-
selves as residents (as ‘scum’ as one of Parry et al. (2007) participants put it). Some
participants believed that the stigma associated with living in particular areas directly limited
their employment opportunities (e.g. Parry et al. 2007), while others discussed health impacts
relating to the ‘shame’ of living in a particular area:
‘I live in Whitecrook and Whitecrook’s got a very bad name. It embarrasses my wife tae
have tae live there, y’know. She feels embarrassed if she tells people or people have tae
come tae the house. It’s a shame. It affects her mentally. It affects me tae a slight extent but
not as bad, I think the wife’s more affected by it.’ (Owen, photovoice participant in Garn-
ham, 2015: 328)
These accounts reflect Bush et al. (2001) observation that the stigma attached to particular
places is perceived to easily transfer to particular communities, stimulating efforts to resist
such ‘labelling’. Participants’ reluctance to openly acknowledge the existence of socioeco-
nomic health inequalities might therefore be understood as part of a set of strategies
intended to limit the sense of stigma, shame and injustice associated with living in particu-
lar places or communities. While not exploring this point in detail, almost all of the study
authors that explored this issue concluded that, in denying the existence of health inequali-
ties, participants were resisting the suggestion that premature ill-health and death was in
some way inevitable for people like them (Airey 2003, Backett-Milburn et al. 2003, Bolam
et al. 2004, Popay et al. 2003a, Watson and Douglas 2012). Indeed, some studies found
that the specific idea of socioeconomic health inequalities could itself become a source of
stress for people living in poorer areas (Davidson et al. 2008, Mackenzie et al. 2017).
Hence, media coverage of health inequalities seemed to contribute to people’s sense of
injustice and stigmatisation:

 Nearly every day I’m picking this paper up, I’m reading aboot the life expectancy wae me
and [compared to] maybe staying doon in London. . . they’re absolutely kicking you every
way they can, like. And if you’re in a poor area, you’ll always be in a poor area. . . Nae-
body’s gonna try and help you oot it, but if you’re in an affluent area, to hell wae the rest.
(‘John’ quoted in Mackenzie et al. 2017: 8)
In contrast, as Figure 2 summarises, assuming individual responsibility for one’s health status
appeared to increase people’s sense of control (something, it is important to remember, that was
already being challenged in multiple ways). This means that efforts to increase public awareness
of health inequalities (e.g. via mass media coverage of the issue) may have the unintentional
impact of further stigmatising and shaming the communities in which poor health is most preva-
lent (i.e. exacerbating some key psychosocial contributors to ill-health) and, potentially, reinforc-
ing a reluctance to acknowledge these inequalities. Reflecting on the quote above, from ‘John’ in
Mackenzie et al. (2017), this seems especially likely where messages about health inequalities
focus on the extent of health differences between particular areas or groups without being con-
nected to any sense that these differences are being (or could be) substantially reduced.
As Figure 2 illustrates, the worrying (though logical) consequence of this was that partici-
pants often seemed to end up blaming themselves for their own poor health:
Author (interviewer): ‘Do you think that living here has affected your health either
positively or negatively?’
Mary (interviewee): ‘No, I don’t think that’s, I think my health problems are just my health
problems [diabetes and angina] and that’s it, I think, I think that the
diabetes was because of my weight, and the heart condition was a
combination of the diet and possibly the passive smoking. I wouldn’t
say that, that it was the environment that’s caused my problems.’

Understanding lay perspectives on socioeconomic health inequalities in Britain
165
 Concluding discussion
Overall, the papers reviewed suggest that people living in a variety of different communities
in the UK have sophisticated understandings of the underlying causes of socioeconomic health
inequalities which closely mirror popular, research-informed theories about health inequalities
(Bartley 2004, Marmot 2010). This aspect of the findings could be read in at least two ways.
On the one hand, the overlap between academic and lay accounts of the health impacts of
social determinants could be used to reinforce claims about the validity of the broad social
determinants of health approach (Marmot et al. 2010). On the other, it could be used to ques-
tion the intellectual utility of continuing to expand the mass of academic research exploring
the causal pathways linking social and economic disadvantage to poor health outcomes (Heath
2007).
As Bolam et al. (2006) conclude, participants’ accounts highlight the importance of both
material-structural factors and social constructions of individual and collective experiences
(i.e. of the deeply intertwined nature of materialist and psychosocial explanations of health
inequalities). In particular, the emphasis that participants placed on experiences of employ-
ment, poor quality jobs and worklessness as health determinants reflects extensive epidemio-
logical evidence (Bambra 2011). Indeed, while the complex and dynamic relationships linking
people’s experiences of socioeconomic deprivation to poor health make singular policy solu-
tions unlikely, the findings add weight to calls for ‘upstream’ policy responses to health
inequalities and suggest supportive employment policies are one of the most promising areas
to focus on.
Likewise, the importance participants attached to experiencing feeling fearful, stressed and
socially isolated, and their concern (and sometimes anger) at feeling judged or disrespected,
all reflect research evidence concerning psychosocial pathways and relative social status and
equality (Marmot 2015). A recently published ethnographic and interview-based study of lay
perspectives on health inequalities in north east England (not included in this meta-ethnogra-
phy as it was only published after our analysis had been completed) also emphasised the
importance of psychosocial pathways, identifying ‘fatalism’ (linked to low sense of control)
as a key psychosocial pathway linking disadvantage to poor health (Garthwaite and Bambra,
2017). This dimension of the findings underlines the importance of the ways in which public
servants (from teachers to Job Centre staff and social workers) interact with the communities
they serve. Indeed, in several cases, single experiences of disrespect, coercion or discrimina-
tion appeared to have had long-term consequences for participants. This suggests that the
increased conditionality of welfare support (combined with cuts in public spending), in
which those seeking benefits are required to provide an array of information to demonstrate
their commitment to finding work (or to support their claim to be unable to work) is
impacting negatively on health in Britain’s poorer communities, further exacerbating health
inequalities.
Finally, participants consistently described proximal, behavioural contributors to poor health,
such as high alcohol consumption, drug use, unhealthy diets and smoking, as ‘coping’ mecha-
nisms or forms of escapism (i.e. as understandable responses to the multiple other factors
impacting on wellbeing). This reinforces research claims that policy interventions aimed only
at this level are unlikely to be effective in reducing health inequalities (Scott et al. 2013,
Whitehead 2007).
In sum, the lay explanations for the drivers of health inequalities in the papers we have
reviewed are presented as sophisticated, multidimensional and correspond well with current
academic models of the impact of inequality on health (Marmot 2010, Popay et al. 2003a,
Smith and Stewart 2016). Indeed, the overlap between academic and lay accounts of the ways

 in which socioeconomic circumstances shape health raise questions about the value of further
analysis of these pathways. Yet, seemingly paradoxically, the findings also suggest that people
experiencing socioeconomic deprivation are unwilling to acknowledge the logical consequence
of all this in naming the existence of health inequalities. We argue (as several authors of
included studies have also done) that this reflects not a lack of understanding but an attempt to
resist some of the stigma and shame associated with poverty (Walker et al. 2013) and poor
health (Scambler 2008) and to exert a sense of individual agency. As Elliott and colleagues
(2016: 229) note, this presents a dilemma for qualitative researchers since, ‘acknowledging the
impact of deprivation, disadvantage and exclusion is potentially to reinforce an identity that
people may be trying to resist’.
In this context, media coverage of health inequalities was described by one participant as a
means of ‘kicking’ communities that were already struggling (see Figure 2). This raises serious
questions about Roberts’s (2009) and Bolam and colleagues’ (2004: 1364) conclusion that we
ought to be working to increase people’s awareness of health inequalities in the hope that
wider public discourse might, in itself, support attempts ‘to tackle these injustices’. Such opti-
mism, while well intended (perhaps even attractive in an era of ‘research impact’ - Smith and
Stewart 2017), seems misplaced in the context of Wacquant’s (2007) observation that territo-
rial stigma is a ‘stamp of dishonour’ which ‘media and certain scholarly discourse’ reinforce
and which residents of affected places work hard to resist by adopting such strategies as hiding
their address (or making excuses for their neighbourhood) and avoiding having family and
friends visit them at home. Even where efforts to raise public awareness are intended to target
more advantaged communities (who may have less direct understanding of the multiple ways
in which socioeconomic circumstances shape health and also be less likely to experience pub-
lic discussions of health inequalities as stigmatising), we suggest researchers have an ethical
obligation to work to limit the negative (unintended) effects of such media coverage on disad-
vantaged communities.
We are not, of course, arguing that researchers should avoid engaging in public discussions
about health inequalities since there are also strong ethical reasons to do so, including as part
of efforts to effect change (Elliott et al. 2016). Nor do we agree with Wacquant’s pessimistic
conclusion that ‘the precariat is a sort of still-born group [that] can only make itself to imme-
diately unmake itself’ (Wacquant, 2007: 73). Rather, we make three tentative suggestions as to
how researchers working in this area might engage in public discussions that both avoid con-
tributing to the stigmatisation of particular places and communities (labels that, Pearce 2012
notes, can be both enduring and highly mobile) and begin enabling people to ‘imagine trans-
formation’ (Elliott et al. 2016). First, most obviously, researchers need to be careful with the
language and labels they employ in discussing health inequalities, particular places and com-
munities. Second, linked to this, we could do more to challenge narratives of binary opposi-
tions in popular culture (e.g. ‘poor’ versus ‘rich’, ‘healthy’ versus ‘unhealthy’) and instead
explore the consequences of inequality for all of us. The unintentional implications of multiple
studies that focus only (or even largely) on more disadvantaged communities (of the kind this
review identified) are that these are the only people for whom inequality really matters and that
it is in these communities that research like this is most needed. An alternative perspective
might take inspiration from Susan George’s (2015) observations that people experiencing
socioeconomic disadvantage already understand their situations very well. Hence, rather than
further research focusing on disadvantaged communities, it might be more useful to analyse
how people across a wider range of social positions understand and engage with health (and
other) inequalities. Third, the focus of future health inequalities research should shift away
from merely analysing the problem (where the risk of reinforcing people’s sense of stigma,
shame and powerlessness seems greatest), to better understanding potential proposals for their

 amelioration. One way of achieving this might be to experiment with deliberative democratic
forms of engagement (Blacksher 2013) and/or with participatory practices specifically intended
to overcome alienation (Blencowe et al. 2015). Others might include analysing the political
processes and decisions that create the initial conditions identified in this review (see George
2015 again). In other words, researchers could both avoid contributing to stigmatising ‘la-
belling’ processes and do more to critically engage with ‘those doing the labelling’ (Bush
