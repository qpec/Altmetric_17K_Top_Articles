What is already known about this topic? 
Childhood obesity is strongly associated with adverse physical health outcomes, less is 
known about its association with mental health outcomes.  
The prevalence and future risk of depression in overweight and obese boys and girls in the 
community is unclear. 
What this study adds? 
Obese females have a significantly increased odds of concurrent and future depression 
compared with non-obese females. 
Clinicians should consider screening obese females for signs and symptoms of depression. 
 
Abstract 
Objectives 
To compare the odds of depression in obese and overweight children with that in normal 
weight children in the community.  
Design  
Systematic review and random-effect meta-analysis of observational studies  
Data sources  
Embase, PubMed and PsychINFO electronic databases, published between January 2000 to 
January 2017. 
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies 
Cross-sectional or longitudinal observational studies that recruited children (aged <18 years) 
drawn from the community who had their weight status classified by body mass index 
  
4 
(BMI), using age and sex adjusted reference charts or the International Obesity Task Force 
(IOTF) age-sex specific cut offs and concurrent or prospective odds of depression was 
measured.  
Results  
Twenty-two studies representing 143,603 children were included in the meta-analysis. 
Prevalence of depression among obese children was 10.4%. Compared with normal weight 
children, odds of depression were 1.32 higher (95% CI 1.17-1.50) in obese children. Among 
obese females, odds of depression were 1.44 (95% CI 1.20-1.72) higher compared to that of 
normal weight females. No association was found between overweight children and 
depression (OR 1.04 95% CI 0.95-1.14) or among obese or overweight male subgroups and 
depression (OR 1.14 95% CI 0.93-1.41 and 1.08 95% CI 0.85-1.37 respectively). Subgroup 
analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies separately revealed childhood obesity 
was associated with both concurrent (OR 1.26 95% CI 1.09-1.45) and prospective odds (OR 
1.51 95% CI 1.21-1.88) of depression.  
Conclusion 
We found strong evidence that obese female children have a significantly higher odds of 
depression compared to normal weight female children and this risk persists into adulthood. 
Clinicians should consider screening obese female children for symptoms of depression.

Background 
 
Childhood mental illness is poorly recognised by healthcare providers and parents, despite 
half of all lifetime cases of diagnosable mental illness beginning by the age of 14 years. (1) 
Globally, depression is the leading cause of disease burden, as measured by disability 
adjusted life years, in children aged 10-19 years.(2) Untreated, it is associated with poor 
school performance and social functioning, substance misuse, recurring depression in 
adulthood and increased suicide risk; which is the second leading cause of preventable 
death among young people. (3-6) The resulting cost to the NHS of treating depression is 
estimated at over £2 billion and the wider social and economic impact of depression is likely 
to be considerable.(7)  
Overweight status and depression are closely related in children, both may develop 
simultaneously sharing a common aetiology and manifesting at different times or one may 
lead to the other.(8, 9)(10) Cognitive and social factors are likely to be important 
mechanisms. (11)(12, 13)   
Childhood obesity itself is a global public health crisis, threatening the health of future 
populations from physical health consequences,(14) such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 
diabetes and cancer (15-17).  So far research efforts have focused on establishing and 
tackling the physical consequences of childhood obesity. However, little is known about the 
impact of excess weight on an already rising mental health.(18)   
Previous studies examining the excess risk of depression from being overweight as a child 
are equivocal. Estimates vary widely from 4% to 64%,(19, 20) due to differences in 
populations, study designs and measurement of weight and depression. Among overweight 
children drawn from specialist clinics, 23.4% are estimated to be depressed.(21) However, 
overweight children drawn from specialist clinics are not representative of children in the 
community and may over estimate risk.(22) Hence, the overall risk of depression in 
overweight children in the community remains unclear. 
Understanding the risk and prevalence of depression in obese children may help guide 
clinicians in identifying high risk children as well as guide policy planners to the mental 
health needs of obese children. We systematically identifying cross-sectional and 
  
6 
prospective studies reporting concurrent or future risk of depression and performing meta-
analysis to report the overall risk of depression in overweight and obese children drawn 
from community settings, compared with normal weight children.

Methods 
 
Study selection 
Types of studies 
We included observational studies with a prospective or retrospective cohort, or cross-
sectional designs, where participants had been recruited from the general population, 
school or community setting. We excluded studies where participants were obtained from 
hospital or specialist settings, as they were unlikely to be representative of obese children in 
the population (22).  
Types of participants 
We included studies if participants were aged 18 years or younger at the time weight was 
reported. In studies where only average age of participants was reported, we included if 
average age across all participants was 18 years or younger.  
Types of measures 
Weight status was defined by calculating body mass index (BMI) and using age and sex 
adjusted reference charts. Obesity was defined as ≥95th centile and overweight ≥ 85th 
centile; or using the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) age-sex specific centiles curves 
correlating to 25 and 30 kg/m2 for adult overweight and obesity.(23) We excluded studies 
that defined obesity using other methods such as waist circumference or body composition 
as these are rarely used in clinical practice.  
Outcome measures 
Our primary outcome of interest was odds (future or concurrent) of depression in obese and 
overweight children compared to normal weight children.  
We included any study where depression had been measured either by standardised 
psychiatric interview, physician reported diagnosis, single or multiple item questions in 
questionnaire or by use of rating scales based on the presence of depressive symptoms 
above a threshold value determine by the study. We excluded studies that reported 
depression scores only, due to lack of patient level data to allow calculation of depression 
prevalence. 
  
8 
We also examined subgroups and odds of depression, including boys and girls and odds of 
concurrent and future risk of depression separately.  
 
Search method for identification of studies 
 
We searched the following databases: EMBASE, MEDLINE via Pubmed, and PsychINFO. We 
combined search terms relating to children under 18 years and obesity with those for 
depression and related MESH headings, truncated with wildcard characters if necessary 
(Appendix 2). Results were limited to human subjects. Search terms not covered under the 
MeSH tree were searched as keywords. Finally, we hand searched reference lists of the 
identified articles for further studies and authoritative reviews. To obtain estimates relevant 
for current practice searches were limited to being published from 2000 (Appendix 2).  Prior 
to publication SS updated searches to identify any new studies.  
Using Endnote (version 7), duplicates were removed, SS reviewed titles for eligibility and 
studies that clearly did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. Two reviewers (SS and 
SSY) independently reviewed the abstracts of the remaining studies and removed any that 
did not meet the inclusion criteria. Potentially eligible or unclear abstracts were obtained as 
full articles. SS and DD screened all full articles for inclusion; two reviewers (SS and DD) read 
the full texts of the papers and extracted the data from the studies that met the inclusion 
criteria (Figure 1). This process was then repeated with the same reviewers to update 
searches. We resolved any disagreements regarding the inclusion or exclusion of papers 
through discussion with a third reviewer (SSax).  
Data collection and analysis 
We analysed data from included studies descriptively and combined by meta-analysis. A 
data extraction form was prepared a priori to extract information on study design, year of 
study publication, year participants were enrolled, follow-up duration and country of study. 
We extracted information on the study population including: number of participants in 
analysis, average age, sex and the numbers of obese, overweight and normal weight 
individuals. For outcomes, we extracted number of individuals reported as depressed per 
weight category, adjusted and unadjusted odds of depression, variables used in adjustment.

Quality assessment 
We assessed study quality by modifying the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for assessing the 
quality of non-randomised studies in meta-analysis examining three potential areas of bias 
in: participant selection, comparability and ascertainment of exposure and outcome 
(appendix 3).(24) A priori we considered studies to be high quality if they scored greater 
than 4 stars in cohort studies or greater than 3 stars in cross-section studies. 
Statistical analysis 
For meta-analysis we used extracted odds ratios and calculated standard errors from 
confidence intervals reported. Where relative risks or hazard ratios were reported, odds 
ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated from absolute numbers of depressed 
children in different weight categories. Where multiple odds or risk ratios were reported, 
we selected the most highly adjusted odds or risk ratio. When in the same study or using the 
same study population, we selected prospective data with the longest follow up period. 
Standard error was calculated from reported confidence intervals or p-value if confidence 
intervals were not reported using previously described methods.(25)  
Where sufficient data were reported, meta-analysis was performed using a random effects 
model. Heterogeneity was examined using the I2 statistic, with an I2 of over 75% indicating 
considerable heterogeneity.(7) Small study effect was assessed visually using funnel plots 
(figure 6) and statistically by performing Egger’s test. We conducted subgroup analysis by 
sex, weight status and study type (cross sectional and longitudinal) enabling us to report the 
sex-specific and comorbid and prospective odds of depression. 
Sensitivity analysis  
Through the review process we identified several factors that may have influenced our 
results. To examine the robustness of our findings we performed sensitivity analyses to 
examine the impact of excluding: studies that use child or parent reported weight, studies 
that include underweight children in their normal weight comparator group, low quality 
studies, studies where participants had their weight status measured before 2000 and 
studies that diagnosed depression based on standardised psychiatric interview.  
All analysis was performed using Stata (version 14).  
  
10 
We reported our findings following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews 
and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analysis. 
(Appendix 1)(26) 
 
Results 
Twenty-two studies, including 143,603 children, met our inclusion criteria (Figure 1). One 
study met our inclusion criteria but was excluded after review due to the age of the study 
and not included.(27) Among included studies, average age was 14.2 years, 48% were male 
and overall prevalence of obesity was 15.5%. Overall, prevalence of depression among 
obese children was 10.4%.  
Study characteristics (table 1) 
Of the 22 studies included, 10 were prospective cohorts and 12 were cross-sectional. The 
length of follow-up ranged from 1 to 20 years in the cohort studies, with half of studies 
having a follow-up period of 2 years or fewer. The number of participants in studies ranged 
from 200 to 43 211. Ten studies were from populations based in the United States. Twelve 
studies reported gender specific odds ratio and two studies reported gender and ethnicity 
specific odds ratio.  
Quality assessment (table 2) 
Studies varied in quality with no study obtaining maximum star rating across the three 
domains of participant selection, comparability of groups and outcome.  
The majority of studies (20/22) selected participants from a community setting, 
representative of the wider population, two studies purposely selected a high proportion of 
ethnic minorities.(28, 29) Over half of studies (14/22) calculated body mass index using 
independently measured height and weight, the remaining eight studies used self-reported 
(parent or child) measures of weight and/or height to determine weight status. Some 
measure of socioeconomic status was adjusted for in 14/22 studies. 
A variety of methods were used to identify depression. The most frequent method was the 
use of depression symptom rating scales (10/22) of which the most frequently used (3 
  
11 
studies) was the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CESD). Other methods 
included structured psychiatric interview (7/22) and previous reported health professional 
diagnosis (2/22). The remaining 3 studies inferred a diagnosis of depression based on single 
item answer in non-depression specific questionnaires.  
 
Meta-analysis 
Meta-analysis of 22 studies, comparing odds of depression in obese children versus normal 
weight children, yielded an odds ratio of 1.32 (95% CI 1.17-1.50). There was substantial 
statistical heterogeneity (chi squared p<0.001), with an I2 of 72.1% (Figure 2). Subgroup 
analysis by gender yielded an odds ratio of 1.44 (95% CI 1.20-1.72) of depression in obese 
females versus normal weight females. In males, the odds ratio was 1.14 (95% CI 0.93-1.41) 
(Figure 2). Both females (I2=50.2%) and males (I2=49%) sub-groups showed lower moderate 
heterogeneity.  
Meta-analysis of 13 studies, comparing odds of depression in overweight children versus 
normal weight children yielded an odds ratio of 1.04 (95 CI 0.95-1.14) with an I2 of 34.2% 
(Figure 3). Further subgroup analysis by gender yielded an odds ratio of 1.07 (95% CI 0.92 -
1.24) of depression in overweight females versus normal weight females. In males, the odds 
ratio was 1.08 (95% CI 0.85-1.37) (Figure 3).  
Subgroup meta-analysis of 10 longitudinal studies comparing odds of depression in obese 
children versus normal weight children yielded an odds ratio of 1.51 (95% CI 1.21-1.88; I2 
30.6%) (Figure 4). Subgroup meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies comparing odds of 
depression in obese children versus normal weight children yielded an odds ratio 1.26 (95% 
CI 1.09-1.45; I2 79.2%) (figure 5).  
 
  
12 
Sensitivity analysis  
Multiple sensitivity analyses were performed (table 3). All except one demonstrated a 
similar trend of results to the main analysis. Meta-analysis of studies restricted to those 
studies that diagnose depression using a standardised psychiatric interview yielded an odds 
ratio of 1.27 (95% CI 0.94-1.70; I2 =18.1%) of depression in obese children versus non-obese 
children. Further analysis by gender revealed no significant association between obesity and 
psychiatric interviewed diagnosed depression among males (OR 0.98 (95% CI 0.42-2.33)) or 
females (OR 1.53 (95% CI 0.88-2.65)).  
 
Small study effects  
Visual assessment of funnel plot (figure 6) suggested no evidence of small study effects. 
Eggers test for asymmetry p=0.286, suggesting no statistical evidence of asymmetry.  
 
 
Discussion 
To date, this is the largest study examining weight status and depression in childhood with 
over 140 000 children drawn from the community and the first to include both concurrent 
and prospective odds of depression. We found, compared to normal weight children, obese 
children have a 32% (95% CI 1.17-1.50) increased odds of current or future depression, with 
greatest odds among obese females (OR 1.44 95% CI 1.20-1.72). We found clear evidence 
that this risk persists over time, whereby in a subgroup meta-analysis of longitudinal studies 
obese children had a 51% (95% CI 1.21-1.88) increased odds of developing depression in the 
future compared to normal weight children. 
No association was found between being overweight and depressed in males or females.  
The size of the study and wide inclusion criteria of all international literature make it 
unlikely that the effect sizes arose by chance. 
  
Findings in relation to previous studies 
Our findings are consistent with the association between obesity and depression reported in 
adults (OR 1.18 95% CI 1.01-1.57),(30) with a greater effect seen in adult females; however 
the magnitude of the association appears stronger in children than adults.  
  
13 
Interestingly, in sub group analysis we only found a significant association with depression 
among obese females. We found no such association exists among obese males or among 
overweight males or females. Plausibly, psychosocial factors such as weight perception and 
body dissatisfaction that mediate between weight and depression do not correlate well with 
BMI.(12, 31)  Only those children who recognise themselves as being overweight, which 
tends to be those with the highest BMI, may then develop the negative body image leading 
to depression. Among males, the relationship is more complicated, as there is no linear 
relationship between body dissatisfaction and increasing BMI, unlike in females.(32) Higher 
BMI in males may be associated with strength and athleticism, and males are more likely to 
underestimate their weight compared to females,(33) hence many overweight males may 
not perceive their weight negatively.  
Policy implications and future research 
We found overall prevalence of depression among obese children at 10%. This is of concern 
as the UK National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) estimates for obesity 
prevalence in year 6 (aged 10/11 years) is 20%; hence, of the estimated 6.5 million children 
aged 10-18 years in the UK, as many as 1.3 million are obese. Our findings suggest 130,000 
of these obese children may be living with depression in the UK. Depression in childhood 
has serious consequences; it is a major risk factor for suicide, which is one of the leading 
causes of death in this age group as well as having an impact on educational and social 
attainment.(34) It is therefore important to recognise and treat depression in children. Yet 
current clinical guidelines on the management of childhood obesity focus entirely on 
screening and preventing the physical harms associated with obesity (35-38). This lack of 
attention to mental health and depression is concerning given our findings. Clinicians should 
consider screening for symptoms of depression in obese children as part of a more holistic 
approach in the management of obese children.  
Sub group analysis of longitudinal studies found a stronger association of obesity and 
depression than among cross sectional studies. The longitudinal relationship between 
obesity and depression adds evidence to the potential causal effect of obesity on 
depression.(8-10) It is also plausible that those children identified with higher weights, 
continue to gain weight over their lives, and hence the psychological and social impact of 
  
14 
the excess weight continues to increase. However, studies varied in their inclusion and 
measurement of known confounders, hence further research is needed to know to what 
degree obesity is an independent risk factor for depression. 
 
Limitations of study 
We acknowledge several important limitations to our study. Firstly, in common with all 
systematic reviews, potentially eligible studies may have been missed. However, searches of 
citations in included studies and reviews made it unlikely that larger studies were missed.  
 Secondly, we found considerable heterogeneity between studies despite our defined 
inclusion criteria. Heterogeneity may have occurred due to differences in study designs or as 
a result of genuine differences in the odds of depression in obese children across different 
populations.  
Thirdly, most of our studies were from high-income countries, of which nearly half (10/22) 
were from the USA. Hence our findings may not be generalisable to low and middle-income 
countries, where the perception of obesity may be different.  
We considered whether other factors might have affected our results and performed 
multiple sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of our findings. We considered 
whether misclassification of underweight individuals into normal weight categories as 
comparator group,(39) and underestimating of weight due to the use of self reported 
weight might have reduced the effect size seen.(40)  Meta-analysis of 7 studies where the 
comparison group did not include underweight children (OR 1.22 95%CI 1.03-1.45) and 
meta-analysis of 14 studies were BMI was objectively measured (OR 1.25 95%CI 1.09-1.44) 
did not substantially alter the results.  
Of the sensitivity analysis performed (table 3), only one would have substantially altered our 
findings. We found restricting meta-analysis to only those 7/22 studies that diagnosed 
depression using structured psychiatric interviews revealed no association between obesity 
and depression (OR 1.27 95%CI 0.94-1.70). It is plausible that obese children exhibit 
symptoms of depressions detected on depression rating scales, however they do not cause 
  
15 
significant functional impairment to meet stricter diagnostic criteria of major depression. 
The lack of functional impairment does not mean that obese children with significant 
depressed symptoms should be ignored; as children with depressive symptoms have 
elevated risk of later depression and suicidal behaviour and share similar future mental 
health risk as those experienced by children with a diagnosis of depression.(41)  
 
Conclusions 
Compared to normal weight female children, we found obese female children have a 44% 
(95% CI 1.20-1.72) increase odds of depression. Further research is needed to understand 
why they are vulnerable to the negative mental health effects of obesity and clinicians 
should consider screening obese female children for symptoms of depression.
