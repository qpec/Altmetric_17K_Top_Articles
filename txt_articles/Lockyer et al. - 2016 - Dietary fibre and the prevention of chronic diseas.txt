 Dietary fibre and the prevention of chronic
disease – should health professionals be doing
more to raise awareness?

Abstract
The recent report on Carbohydrates and Health by the Scientific Advisory
Committee on Nutrition concluded that a high fibre intake is associated with
reduced risk of a number of significant chronic diseases in the UK, although
further studies are needed to fully elucidate the precise mechanisms involved.
New recommendations have been set for adults and younger people but dietary
surveys suggest that intakes are currently well below these targets, reflecting low
consumption of fibre-containing foods such as fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds
and high-fibre/wholegrain starchy foods. A wide number of interrelated barriers
to increasing intakes have been purported. These include a lack of awareness of
the health benefits of fibre; relatively little interest amongst the media compared
with other nutrients (e.g. sugars); perceived high cost of fruit and vegetables;
perceptions of starchy carbohydrates as unhealthy; taste preferences for refined
grains;
lack
of
a
specific
dietary
recommendation
or
national
awareness
campaign for fibre or wholegrain intake; no general permitted (European Food
Safety Authority approved) health claims for fibre and wholegrain; and a lack of
mandatory labelling of fibre values on packaging. Health professionals have an
important role in giving dietary advice, including the promotion of dietary fibre.
However, as well as limited time during appointments to discuss diet and
lifestyle issues, the level of confidence and competency in delivering such advice
may be lacking amongst some health professionals. Current knowledge and
awareness of the key messages around dietary fibre amongst health professionals
have been poorly studied. A small online survey of UK practice nurses (n = 50)
recently commissioned by the British Nutrition Foundation suggested that,
although the benefits of dietary fibre intake in relation to cardiovascular disease,
type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer are largely acknowledged, the perceived
importance of fibre for patient health is lower than other nutrients such as fat
and sugars. One in five nurses reported not having adequate skills or knowledge
to offer dietary advice and one in four said they sometimes lacked the confidence
to give dietary advice to their patients. In view of the evidence for the health
benefits for dietary fibre, there is a need to increase the importance that health
professionals place on communicating ways to boost intakes amongst their

The health benefits of dietary fibre with regard to gas-
trointestinal or digestive health have long been recog-
nised. A protective effect for colorectal cancer was
hypothesised in the 1970s when low rates of the dis-
ease were observed in Africa (Burkitt 1971). Evidence
of increased faecal weight with fibre intake, and the
observation that there tended to be a lower incidence
of bowel disease in populations with higher faecal
weights, was used as the basis of the UK Dietary Ref-
erence Value (DRV) for fibre set by the Committee on
Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) in 1991.
More recently, the UK’s Scientific Advisory Committee
on Nutrition (SACN) reviewed the wealth of evidence
published in the subsequent 25 years, describing its
findings
in
the
report
Carbohydrates
and
Health
(SACN 2015). The body of evidence from prospective
cohort studies suggests that increased intakes of total
dietary fibre, and particularly cereal fibre and whole-
grains, are associated with a lower risk of cardio-
metabolic disease and colorectal cancer (Table 1).
Following this report, the UK DRV for fibre intake
was raised from 18 g of non-starch polysaccharide
(NSP) fibre (or around 24 g of AOAC fibre1) per day
to 30 g of AOAC fibre per day for those aged
16 years and over. This is higher than that set by the
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and in Ire-
land, but is comparable with recommended intakes in
other nations (Table 2).
Chronic
diseases
such
as
cardiovascular
disease
(CVD), type 2 diabetes and colorectal cancer are
major causes of mortality and morbidity in the UK.
CVD is responsible for 27% of deaths (155 000 per
year, 26% of which are under the age of 75 years),
whilst an estimated 7 million people in the UK are liv-
ing with the condition (BHF 2016). In 2013, 6% of
the adult population had diagnosed diabetes, with an
estimated 90% being type 2 diabetes (Diabetes UK
2014). Bowel cancer is the third most common cancer
in both men and women and the second most com-
mon cause of cancer death in the UK after lung cancer
(Cancer Research UK 2012).
Based
on
prospective
studies
(n = 10),
SACN
reported a 9% reduced risk of CVD with every 7 g of
additional fibre intake (Table 1). Such studies suggest
a greater protective effect in comparison with other
dietary components often promoted for cardiovascular
health. For example, the prospective US Women’s
Health Study (n = 39 876) reported a 17% reduction
in CVD risk with each 10 g increment of daily intake
of dietary fibre (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.69, 1.01) (Liu
et al. 2002) compared with a reduction in risk of 6%
(RR 0.94; 95% CI 0.85, 1.02) with each additional
daily serving of fruit and vegetables (Liu et al. 2000).

Dietary fibre – raising awareness
215
 In its review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs),
SACN found total dietary fibre, wheat fibre, other cer-
eal fibres and fibre from specific fruit and vegetables
to increase faecal mass and decrease intestinal transit
times. Consumption of cereal fibre was found to
reduce constipation (Table 3). On average, each gram
of mixed dietary fibre increased faecal weight by 4 g
and each gram of wheat fibre increased faecal weight
by 4.8 g but there were insufficient studies to perform
meta-analyses for the remaining fibre types. Recent
reviews have supported this finding, concluding that
there is good evidence that cereal fibres, particularly
wheat fibre, increase faecal weight and speed up tran-
sit time. Studies also suggest fruit and vegetable fibre
to have the same effects (de Vries et al. 2015, 2016).
The general view is that dietary fibre, whether from
cereals, fruit or vegetables, confers benefit on digestive
health and should be included as part of a healthy
diet.
Although SACN concluded that there was insuffi-
cient evidence from RCTs demonstrating beneficial
effects of dietary fibre on cardiovascular risk markers
such as blood pressure and fasting lipids, RCTs have
shown higher intakes of oat bran and isolated b-glu-
cans to lower total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol, triacylglycerol concentrations and
blood pressure (Table 3).
Prior to the new fibre DRVs, specific recommenda-
tions for fibre had not been set for children. However,
concerns raised in the past that high-fibre diets in
young children would lead to growth faltering and
mineral imbalance in the developed world have not
been well supported by research studies. Rather it has
been suggested that, with the high rate of childhood
obesity, increases in dietary fibre amongst those aged
over
2 years
may
help
to
reduce
energy
intake.
Although SACN reported a paucity of evidence in
relation to the effects of dietary fibre intake in infants
and children, the lack of an adverse effect in the high-
est infant and child fibre consumers supported the set-
ting of a DRV for younger groups as a proportion of
the adult DRV. The new DRVs are 25 g/day for ado-
lescents aged 11–16 years, 20 g/day for children aged
5–11 years and 15 g/day for children aged 2–5 years.
It is important to note that these recommendations
are made providing children are able to achieve an
adequate energy intake and are thriving.
The Eatwell Guide
In the light of the new fibre and free sugars recom-
mendations, Public Health England (PHE) recently
reviewed and launched a revised healthy eating model
for the UK population. The Eatwell Guide (Fig. 1)
depicts increased segment sizes for the starchy carbo-
hydrates and fruit and vegetables groups compared
with the previous version, the eatwell plate. Selection
of beans, pulses and other sustainable plant proteins is
also encouraged. Messages of relevance to dietary fibre
within the accompanying booklet supporting the Eat-
well Guide (PHE 2016b) are summarised in Table 4.
Fibre intake in the UK
Information about fibre intakes in the UK can be
obtained from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey
(NDNS)
(2008/2009–2011/2012),
which
provides
details of dietary intake from 6828 individuals aged
1.5 years and above, and the Family Food Survey
2014, a survey in which around 6000 households in
the
UK
record
their
food
and
drink
purchases.
Although there are limitations in the data, these sur-
veys currently provide the best national insight into
the population’s dietary intake.
From NDNS data, it is clear that average fibre
intakes in all age groups are currently well below the
recommendations, with adults, on average, needing to
consume around 12 g more per day (see Table 5). The
main foods contributing to fibre intake are cereals and

 cereal products (39% in adults), followed by fruit and
vegetables (29%) and potatoes (13%) (see Fig. 2 and
Tables 6 and 7 for a more detailed breakdown).
As the Eatwell Guide depicts, fruit and vegetables
and starchy carbohydrates should form the most sub-
stantial parts of the UK diet. However, data from the
Family Food Survey indicates that starchy carbohy-
drates make up only 19% and fruit and vegetables
only 25% of food purchases (Defra 2015).
Consumption of fibre-containing foods
NDNS data indicates a current mean intake in adults
of 13.7 g of NSP fibre (around 18 g of AOAC fibre)
per day (12.8 g in women, 14.7 g in men), whilst previ-
ous NDNS data from 2000/2001 reported the mean
intake in adults to be 13.9 g of NSP fibre (around
18.5 g of AOAC fibre) per day (12.6 g in women and
15.5 g in men). However, more recent data from the
Family Food Survey suggests a larger decrease, with
average intake in 2014 estimated as 14.2 g of NSP
fibre/day, 7% lower than in 2001 (Defra 2015). This
reflects decreased sales of the major fibre-contributing
foods (Fig. 3). Despite wholemeal bread now represent-
ing a larger proportion of total bread purchases, sales
of all bread types have decreased and were 20% lower
in 2014 compared with 2004. Potato purchases have
also seen a substantial decline during this time period
(18%). Similarly, falling trends in green vegetables have
been observed over a long time period.
It is important to note that fibre-rich foods, such as
cereal products, vegetables and potatoes, also make
substantial contributions to micronutrient intakes in
the UK (Bates et al. 2014). Wholegrain products, for
example, are often more micronutrient dense than
refined grain products (see Table 8).
Current intakes of wholegrain
Part of the emphasis on consumption of wholegrains
in healthy eating guidelines relates to their higher
fibre
content.

 recommendations on the amount of wholegrains that
should be consumed each day in the UK. This is in
contrast to some other areas of the world. In Den-
mark, for example, adults are recommended to con-
sume at least 75 g of wholegrain per day (Mejborn
et al. 2008), whilst US guidelines specify 48 g/day
(USDHHS/USDA 2010). A recent analysis of NDNS
data suggested median wholegrain intake in the UK to
be 20 g/day for adults and 13 g/day for children/teen-
agers (Mann et al. 2015), with 18% of adults defined
as non-consumers. In the UK (Mann et al. 2015) and
elsewhere (Bellisle et al. 2014), there are socio-eco-
nomic differences in wholegrain consumption, with
higher intakes reported in those with higher education
and income.
Breakfast consumption
Observational studies have demonstrated a number of
benefits of eating breakfast including better overall
dietary composition, higher intake of micronutrients
and a higher intake of fibre (Deshmukh-Taskar et al.
2010; Barr et al. 2014; O’Neil et al. 2015). However,
some 14% of children aged 5–15 years in the UK are
reported to skip breakfast (Hoyland et al. 2012).
Although the current NDNS has not reported patterns
in breakfast consumption, a study looking at older
data from the 2001 NDNS found that around 1 in 5
adults either skip breakfast completely or only have a
drink
(Gibson
&
Gunn
2011).
This
study
also
reported that average daily AOAC fibre intake was
14.6 g in breakfast skippers, 22.6 g in breakfast cereal
consumers and 16.0 g in consumers of other breakfast
items (Gibson & Gunn 2011).
Further studies have also demonstrated consumers
of ready-to-eat breakfast cereals to have higher daily
intakes of fibre and micronutrients than those who
consume other foods for breakfast (Grieger & Cobiac
2012).
Those on a low income are more likely to skip
breakfast (Keski-Rahkonen et al. 2003) and to con-
sume breakfasts that do not comprise cereal, fruit or
bread (Moore et al. 2007). Analysis of the 2003–2005
Low Income Diet and Nutrition Survey reported that
average intakes of fibre were higher in adult breakfast
cereal consumers vs. non-consumers but there were no
differences in children.
Current intakes of fruit and vegetables
Fruit and vegetables are important contributors to
fibre intake in the UK. However, as a nation we are
not meeting the 5 A DAY recommendation. Adults
aged 19–64 years consume 4.1 portions of fruit and
vegetables per day on average, with only 30% of both
men and women achieving 5 A DAY (Bates et al.
2014). Mean consumption of fruit and vegetables for

Fibre intake and dietary quality
Higher intakes of fibre tend to be associated with bet-
ter diet quality overall. Fibre intake has been reported
to be significantly higher amongst individuals achiev-
ing UK dietary targets for fat (<35% food energy), sat-
urates (<11% food energy) and fruit and vegetables
(Harland et al. 2012).
A study of 851 Irish adults looking at dietary pat-
terns reported that those who consumed a ‘prudent
diet’ (i.e. a diet that was lower in fat, with higher
intakes of unrefined cereals, fish, poultry, low-fat dairy
products and fruit and vegetables) had significantly
higher intakes of fibre, as well as polyunsaturated
fatty acids and vitamins C and E, and significantly
lower intakes of total fat, saturates, monounsaturated

 fatty acids and cholesterol, when compared with the
two other patterns identified, the ‘traditional Irish diet’
and the ‘alcohol and convenience foods diet’ (Villegas
et al. 2004).
Achieving the new SACN
recommendations for fibre
The average daily fibre intake that could be achieved
by consuming 5 9 80 g portions of fruits and vegeta-
bles and 3 portions of starchy foods (including whole-
grains) has been estimated as 21.7 g of AOAC fibre/
day (Hooper et al. 2015). In order to meet the new
30 g target for adults, additional fibre is required, pos-
sibly from high-fibre snacks (e.g. rye crispbreads, nuts
and seeds), regular inclusion of pulses in meals, addi-
tional portions of fruit and vegetables (particularly
those with higher fibre contents) and/or incorporation
of new varieties of wholegrains into the diet (such as
quinoa). Table 9 shows the fibre content of a variety
of foods including starchy foods, breakfast items,
fruit, vegetables and snacks, illustrating the variation
between different options within each food category.
Considering current intakes, adjusting food choices
in order to achieve the new fibre recommendation will
be a challenge for the majority of individuals. For
example, only 17% of adults in the UK consume nuts
and/or seeds (Bates et al. 2014). However, the 30 g
target is possible in the context of a healthy, balanced
diet. As an example, the British Nutrition Foundation
(BNF) developed a 7-day meal plan (BNF 2015) which

 recommendations might be achieved, whilst also meet-
ing other UK dietary and food-based recommenda-
tions, including no more than 5% of total energy
from free sugars (SACN 2015). This plan included the
consumption of over 8 portions (80 g or equivalent)
of fruit and vegetables daily, high-fibre snacks (such as
nuts and seeds) and all meals based on starchy foods,
predominantly wholegrain. The cost of the plan was
calculated using prices from two leading UK super-
markets, based on own brand products. This was
estimated to be £37.24 per adult per week, which can
be compared with the Family Food Survey average
household spend on food of £41.97 per person per
week (Defra 2015), although it is worth noting that
the Family Food Survey spend reflects foods consumed
both in and out of the home, whereas foods and
drinks in the BNF plan were mostly home prepared.
Barriers to increasing fibre intakes
Labelling and EU health claims
Nutrition information on food labels must comply
with a format set out within the EU Food Information
for Consumers Regulations (European Commission
2011). However, mandatory values are only indicated
for energy, fat, saturates, carbohydrates, sugars, pro-
tein and salt and not for fibre. The provision of front-
of-pack information is voluntary but if provided must
also meet the Regulations. This includes energy alone
or
energy
plus
fat,
saturates,
sugars
and
salt
(Table 10). Percentage Reference Intakes (% RIs) can
be given on a per 100 g/ml and/or per portion basis.
Additional forms of expression are allowed if they
meet the requirements set and the UK government
have developed ‘traffic light’ colour-coded nutritional
information.
Manufacturers can voluntarily claim foods as a ‘source
of fibre’ if it contains at least 3 g of fibre per 100 g or

 1.5 g of fibre/100 kcal, or ‘high in fibre’ if it contains at
least 6 g per 100 g or 3 g/100 kcal and where these
claims are used, the fibre content must be provided in
nutrition information on the back-of-pack (European
Commission 2006). However, it is of note that fibre is
not one of the four nutrients, in addition to energy, per-
mitted on front-of-pack and it does not have a Reference
Intake. Therefore, consumers have no direct information
with regard to the proportion as a percentage of their
daily fibre requirement that a portion of the food pro-
vides, although the actual grams of fibre per 100 g and
per portion can be included on the back-of-pack.
According to market analysis by Mintel, the share
of products making high-fibre claims grew in 2014
(Mintel 2015). However, research undertaken as part
of the EU-funded CLYMBOL project looking at 400
randomly selected products in the UK, The Nether-
lands, Germany, Slovenia and Spain reported that only
9% of nutrition claims referred to fibre, whereas 35%
referred to vitamins and minerals, 24% to the fat
content and 12% to the sugar content (Hieke et al.
2016). The authors reported that of the UK products
using an ingredient claim communicating the presence
of an ingredient which is not a nutrient as defined in
EU Regulation, most referred to fruit and vegetable
content (e.g. ‘one of your 5 A DAY’) or wholegrain
(e.g. ‘with wholegrain’).
The lack of mandatory labelling of dietary fibre
makes it difficult for consumers to compare products
and, furthermore, will not act to increase consumer
awareness of fibre. Additionally, no general health
claims for dietary fibre or wholegrains have been
authorised except for specific types (mainly in relation
to intestinal transit time and faecal bulk) (Table 11),
making communication of health benefits to con-
sumers difficult.
Consumer understanding of the health benefits of fibre
Since the release of the SACN report, media focus has
very much been on sugars, rather than on fibre. It is
unclear as to whether the association between high-
fibre diets and health benefits is recognised or under-
stood by consumers. The importance consumers place
on fibre-containing foods as part of a healthy, bal-
anced diet is also unknown.
In the Food Standards Agency’s (FSA) consumer
attitudes survey, Food and You, of Scottish consumers
(FSA 2014), only 26% thought starchy foods were
very important to eat for a healthy lifestyle and 68%
did not place starchy foods in the correct section of
the eatwell plate (the food-based model used at that
time) (PHE 2013). In comparison, 82% of respondents
said that it was very important to eat fruit and vegeta-
bles and 71% knew that the recommended number of
portions of fruit and vegetables to eat per day was
five. A large proportion (75–93%) knew that frozen,
canned, dried and juiced fruit and vegetables counted
towards 5 A DAY; however, fewer consumers (around
60%) knew that baked beans and pulses count. Wor-
ryingly, 20% of respondents thought that rice would
count towards 5 A DAY and 17% thought that jam
would count as a portion.
In a study carried out in Ireland for the FSA (Ipsos
Mori 2012a), subjects reported that consumption of
starchy carbohydrates should contribute about a quar-
ter of their food intake rather than the third suggested
by the eatwell plate (PHE 2013). Whilst bread, break-
fast cereals, potatoes and baked products were popu-
lar amongst the respondents, foods such as pasta, rice
and couscous seemed unfamiliar to older individuals,
and knowledge of whether some foods are classed as
starchy carbohydrates or not was poor. There was a
perception that starchy carbohydrates were fattening,
with many people stating that they were trying to cut
down, for example by eliminating bread from their
diet in order to lose weight and with participants cit-
ing information read in newspapers and celebrity
magazines as the reason for doing this. Terms associ-
ated with starchy foods included ‘stodgy’, ‘heavy’,
‘bloating’ and also ‘providing energy’ and respondents
described feeling tired after carbohydrate-rich meals.
Bread, rice and pasta were perceived to be convenient
as they have long shelf lives and can be prepared
quickly and cheaply, although some noted that whole-
grain breads can be more expensive than white ver-
sions which may be a barrier to consumption. Some
older participants referred to bread and potatoes as
being good sources of fibre or ‘roughage’ but in

 general respondents were unaware of the nutrients
that starchy carbohydrates provide, particularly micro-
nutrients. The majority acknowledged that whole-
grains were healthy and referred to advertisements
they had seen for breakfast cereals which depict a link
with better heart health. The same report gathered the
views of a small number of health professionals and
reported that, whilst dietitians were advising patients
in line with government guidelines with regard to star-
chy carbohydrate consumption (i.e. that these should
make up a third of every meal, as per the eatwell
plate), other types of health professionals were unsure
as to the quantity of starchy carbohydrates that should
be consumed. Practice nurses had varied opinions but
tended to advise patients to avoid bread and pasta,
particularly those running obesity clinics.
In a similar focus group study carried out in
Scotland (Ipsos Mori 2012b), the small group of health
professionals interviewed felt that the message ‘choose
wholegrain varieties when you can’ was confusing for
consumers because it may encourage poor perception
of refined carbohydrates amongst those not liking the
taste of wholegrain foods. Concern was also expressed
that potatoes are viewed by consumers as ‘white’ car-
bohydrates, as there is no wholegrain version (although
potatoes in
skins
can
contribute
to
dietary
fibre
intakes). Consumers held the view that if they ate
larger amounts of starchy foods, it may encourage
them to eat more of accompanying foods (e.g. fat
spread) which would lead to higher intakes of fat and
sugars. Overall, health professionals noted that addi-
tional messaging for consumers is required to reduce
confusion and improve the perception of starchy foods.
Practical and behavioural barriers to fibre
consumption
Barriers to increasing fibre intakes commonly cited by
consumers are listed in Table 12.
Consumers often cite price as the most important fac-
tor determining product choice (Hawkes 2012). A recent
UK study looking at resemblance of dietary patterns to
the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)
diet, which emphasises plant-based foods and whole-
grains, found that diets which were the most aligned with
this approach were 18% more expensive than those that
were the least aligned (Monsivais et al. 2015). In addi-
tion, a UK analysis reported that healthier foods, such as
fruit and vegetables, have been shown to be 3 times more
expensive per calorie than those high in fat and/or sugar
(Jones et al. 2014). Those on a low income report pur-
chasing foods on special offer in supermarkets as a strat-
egy for saving money (Hayter et al. 2015), but research
has highlighted that these are more likely to be unhealthy
products rather than fruit and vegetables (Khanom et al.
2015; PHE 2015). Ofcom data from 2003 reported 60%
of food advertising spend in the UK was for confec-
tionery and pre-prepared foods, whilst only 3% was on
fresh fruit and vegetables (Ofcom 2003).
In terms of choice, the availability of wholegrain
options when eating out is slowly increasing, with the
appearance of wholemeal pizza bases and brown rice
on some restaurant menus, but more could be done by
the catering sector to offer a wider variety of high
fibre
choices.
Pre-packed
sandwiches
made
from
wholemeal bread rather than white are more com-
monly available and some supermarkets have opted to
remove confectionery from checkouts, replacing these
with higher-fibre snacks such as nuts and dried fruit.
Diets which restrict intake of fibre
The BNF 7-day meal planner for adults suggests it is
extremely difficult to consume 30 g of fibre/day without
basing meals on starchy carbohydrates (BNF 2015).
Around one in 100 people in the UK has coeliac dis-
ease (NHS Choices 2014) and needs to avoid gluten
(present in products made from wheat, rye and barley)
for medical reasons. Others avoid gluten due to a self-
diagnosed intolerance or a perceived health benefit of
a gluten-free diet. Furthermore, the popularity of low-
carbohydrate diets has resulted in some individuals
choosing to avoid or reduce their consumption of
potatoes, as well as grain products (Nicklas et al.
2013). Low consumption of carbohydrates has been
associated with lower fibre and wholegrain intakes
(Oh et al. 2005; Fung et al. 2010).
Impact of initiatives to promote high-fibre/
wholegrain foods internationally
In order to increase fibre intakes, interventions can
focus on fibre per se or the promotion of high-fibre

Dietary fibre – raising awareness

 foods such as fruit and vegetables and wholegrains.
Campaigns to increase fruit and vegetable intake have
been prominent both in the UK and internationally.
The UK 5 A DAY scheme, launched in 2003, aimed
to increase awareness and consumption of fruit and
vegetables to 5 x 80 g portions/day for everyone by
2015. The initiative included the National School
Fruit Scheme, an advertising campaign, community-
level activities such as ‘Cook and Eat’ and ‘Sow and
Grow’ schemes, partnership with industry to allow
logos to be used on food labels displaying how many
portions of fruit and vegetables products contain, and
the incorporation of the 5 A DAY message into larger
public health schemes such as Change4Life. The 5 A
DAY messages on the Change4Life website promote
fruit and vegetables as a source of fibre and encourage
healthier high-fibre snacks such as nuts, seeds, fruit
and vegetables (DH 2016).
It may be assumed that if initiatives to reach 5 A
DAY are successful, we may see a concurrent increase
in fibre intake in the UK. However, an analysis of the
impact of the 5 A DAY campaign, taking into account
changes in price over time, estimated that it has prob-
ably been responsible for an increase of just 0.3 por-
tions per person per day, with differences observed
according to income groups and no impact seen in the
first 2 years (Capacci & Mazzocchi 2011). Similarly, a
review of initiatives promoting fruit and vegetable
consumption
to
general
populations
reported
an
increase in average consumption of a mere 0.2–0.6
portions per person per day (Pomerleau et al. 2005).
In contrast, Denmark’s 6 A DAY initiative, which pro-
moted consumption of 6 portions or 600 g of fruit
and vegetables per day, by increasing the accessibility
of fruit and vegetables in schools, restaurants and
workplaces, has been reported as more successful.
Between 1995 and 2002, fruit intake rose by 64%
and vegetable intake increased by 33% (National
Food Institute 2005). Mean intakes of fruit and veg-
etables
between 2003
and 2008 amongst Danish
adults (18–75 years) were reported to be 442 g per
person/day, higher than the WHO recommendation of
400 g (National Food Institute 2010). By contrast,
mean intake of fruit and vegetables in the latest UK
NDNS was reported as 348 g (Bates et al. 2014).
As
well
as
fruit
and
vegetables,
campaigns
to
increase wholegrain intake in the population may
improve fibre intake. Again in Denmark, a public
health campaign was initiated in 2009 to increase
wholegrain
consumption
(Brinch-Nielsen
&
Neese
2013). Mean wholegrain intake increased from 32 g
to 55 g/day between 2004 and 2012 (Mejborn et al.
2013). UK adult intakes of wholegrain, as discussed
above, have been reported as 20 g/day (Mann et al.
2015), though in Denmark, high-fibre bread (contain-
ing >6 g of fibre per 100 g) is a traditional part of
the diet which may partly explain the difference in
wholegrain intakes between the two nations (Nordic
Council of Ministers 2012).
In 2005, the Whole Grain Stamp was launched in
the US by The Whole Grains Council to encourage
consumption (The Wholegrains Council 2003). Two
similar logos are available to place on eligible prod-
ucts, one for those which contain either at least 8 g of
wholegrains per serving (but may also contain refined
grains) and the 100% Whole Grain Stamp for prod-
ucts which contain at least 16 g of wholegrains per
serving and all of its grain ingredients are wholegrain.
The Whole Grain Stamp was briefly tested in the UK
on bread by Morrison’s supermarkets in 2008 but
came under the scrutiny of FSA guidance because the
Stamp, reflecting US dietary guidelines, recommends
48 g of wholegrains/day, which is not a UK recom-
mendation.
Other
campaigns
undertaken
by
The
Wholegrains Council have been ‘Just Ask for Whole
Grains’, a grassroots campaign that involved nurses,
dietitians and teachers, and the ‘Whole Grains Chal-
lenge’, a campaign for restaurants to provide at least
one wholegrain choice. For example, McDonald’s
introduced a bun for premium chicken sandwiches
which contained 8 g of wholegrains and some Chinese
restaurants added brown rice as an option. Three
years after the introduction of the Stamp, market
research reported that consumption of wholegrains
rose by 20% overall, with 18–34 year-olds increasing
their consumption the most, at 38% (The Wholegrains
Council 2009). Although, according to national survey
data, fibre intake amongst adults aged 20 years and
over only increased from 15.5 g in 2003–2004 (USDA
2004) to 15.9 g/day in 2007–2008 (USDA 2008).
In 1989, Sweden developed the Keyhole symbol for
food packaging to help consumers identify products
and meals in restaurants and canteens which contain
less fat, sugars and salt and more fibre than products
of
the
same
type
not
carrying
the
symbol.
The
Keyhole has also been widely used in Norway and
Denmark
since
2009
and
more
recently,
Iceland
(The Norwegian Food Safety Authority 2012). Food
authorities in the Nordic countries have set criteria
which foods must adhere to in order to bear the sym-
bol (EFTA Surveillance Authority 2014). For example,
flour
and
grain
products
must
contain
minimum
amounts of wholegrain and fibre, depending on the
type
(e.g.
bread
must
contain
at
least
30%

 wholegrains and 5 g of fibre per 100 g and pasta must
contain at least 50% wholegrain and 6 g of fibre per
100 g); breakfast cereals must contain at least 55%
wholegrain and 6 g of fibre per 100 g and porridge
must contain at least 55% wholegrain and 1 g of fibre
per 100 g after preparation. Ready meals, pizzas,
soups
and
sandwiches
must
contain
minimum
amounts of vegetables, legumes or fruit (e.g. 25 g per
100 g of sandwich and 50 g per 100 g of soup) and
cereal elements within these foods must contain mini-
mum
amounts
of
wholegrain.
Early
research
in
Sweden indicated that women who had more knowl-
edge of the symbol reported having a higher intake of
Keyhole-labelled high-fibre foods, but this was not the
case in men (Larsson et al. 1999). By the end of 2011,
98% of consumers in Norway and Sweden and 88%
of those in Denmark recognised the symbol (Swedish
National Food Agency 2013) and consumer research
carried out in 2015 indicated that 85% knew that the
symbol means a healthier food choice, 40% saw it as
a tool that makes it easier to choose healthier options
and 30% take the symbol into account when food
shopping (Determinants of Diet and Physical Activity
2015). Recent modelling work has indicated that
switching to Keyhole-labelled products would increase
dietary fibre intake by 4.7 g/day (Norwegian Direc-
torate of Health 2015).
Health professionals and fibre messaging
Modifiable lifestyle-associated risk factors, such as diet
and bodyweight, are significant contributors to the
development of chronic disease (WHO 2007) and, as
such, consumer education on healthy lifestyle beha-
viours is key for both disease prevention and manage-
ment. Health professionals may seem ideally placed
for such a task, as they have both the opportunity to
discuss lifestyle issues with patients and are a trusted
source of health information. However, a number of
significant barriers have been identified in relation to
the delivery of dietary advice during routine health
appointments. For example, research has suggested
that health professionals receive little nutrition train-
ing, are ill-equipped to assess their patients’ diets and
nutritional status, as well as provide dietary advice
(Kris-Etherton et al. 2015) and that time available
with patients is limited (Ball et al. 2010). Further-
more, health professionals may lack the confidence to
deliver dietary advice (Barlow et al. 2010) or feel
uncomfortable discussing issues of overweight and
obesity
with
their
patients
(Falconer
et al.
2014;
Doorley et al. 2015). This is compounded by the
problem that two-thirds of health professionals are
overweight themselves, increasing their sensitivity to
discuss diet-related issues (DH 2011).
A qualitative study by Cass et al. of 20 Australian
female practice nurses used a thematic trend analysis
to investigate the perception of nurses around their
role and competency to provide nutritional care to
patients with chronic disease. Practice nurses recog-
nised that their ability to build a good rapport with
patients, and the fact that they are seen by patients to
be more approachable than GPs, placed them in an
ideal position to deliver nutrition information. How-
ever, they also raised a lack of confidence in providing
nutrition care, a lack of specific nutrition training and
inadequate time. The practice nurses were also reluc-
tant to cross professional boundaries, and a lack of
clarity was noted in what constitutes basic nutrition
care (to be delivered by nurses) and more specialised
care (needing referral to a dietitian). Negative patient
attitudes towards diet were considered disincentives to
offering dietary advice (Cass et al. 2014).
Views and practices of practice nurses
towards dietary fibre: Results of an online
survey
In order to further explore knowledge of dietary fibre
amongst practice nurses, BNF developed an online
survey, which was disseminated by Sensory Dimen-
sions Ltd, Reading. To our knowledge, there are no
validated questionnaires that have been designed for
this purpose. Survey questions were therefore adapted
from
published
questionnaires
investigating
other
aspects of nutrition knowledge of health professionals
(Green et al. 2000; Warber et al. 2000; Hankey et al.
2004; de Pinho et al. 2013; Nowson et al. 2015). The
survey included 30 questions, which were a mixture of
multiple choice, open-ended questions and case studies
on patients with the following conditions: high blood
cholesterol, impaired glucose tolerance and obesity,
constipation and increased risk of colorectal cancer.
Although the survey was designed to examine knowl-
edge of dietary fibre, as well as perceptions of the
importance of fibre in relation to the prevention and
treatment
of
different
conditions,
questions
were
included on a range of dietary topics to prevent
awareness of the focus of investigation. A total of 50
practice nurses around the UK responded to the online
survey.
The vast majority of nurses (90%) saw patients with
conditions where dietary advice including fibre would
be relevant (such as CVD, type 2 diabetes, obesity and
© 2016 The Authors. Nutrition Bulletin published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Nutrition Foundation Nutrition Bulletin, 41, 214–231

225
 constipation). However, 1 in 6 nurses surveyed did
not feel that recommending dietary changes should be
part of their job and 1 in 5 reported not having ade-
quate skills or knowledge to support their patients in
dietary matters. Moreover, a quarter did not feel con-
fident giving dietary advice to their patients.
Sixty-eight per cent of nurses reported that they fre-
quently raise the topic of fibre in discussions around
diet with their patients. Increasing intake of fibre or
wholegrains was given as an unprompted healthy eat-
ing tip, although this was not reported as frequently
as increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Fibre, how-
ever, was not one of the nutrition topics the nurses
indicated that they are commonly asked about by their
patients. These more typically related to sugars, fats,
weight loss, food allergies and intolerances. This was
reflected in the nurses’ low rating of dietary fibre
amongst the main diet-related problems for their
patients
(4%);
those
rated
highest
being
obesity
(32%), sugars (26%) and fats (20%).
The association of fibre with risk reduction in CVD
(including decreasing blood cholesterol), type 2 dia-
betes and colorectal cancer, as well as its benefits for
management of constipation, were fairly well, but not
universally, understood (Fig. 4).
The survey indicated that there may be some com-
mon misunderstandings. For example, half of the
nurses surveyed reported that a high-fibre diet can
reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes, and around 30%
were unsure as to whether it could reduce risk of
allergy. Furthermore, responses suggested that nurses
held a somewhat negative view of ‘starchy foods’ as a
food group, as has previously been shown elsewhere
(Ipsos Mori 2012a), with many suggesting that lower-
ing intake of such foods is appropriate for reducing
cholesterol (86%) and reducing the risk of developing
type 2 diabetes (80%).
Interestingly, nurses who had qualified earlier (1991
or before) were more likely to recommend increasing
fibre as a healthy eating tip for the prevention of
chronic diseases than those who had trained more
recently (after 1991) (P = 0.04). Although this could
be a chance finding, it may reflect the greater emphasis
placed on the health benefits of dietary fibre, including
the popularity of the ‘F-Plan diet’, in the 1980s (Eyton
1982; Eastwood & Passmore 1983). This was influ-
enced by the work of Dennis Burkitt in the 1970s and
1980s comparing health outcomes associated with low
fibre consumption in the Western diet with the high-
fibre diets observed in Africa. His book, Don’t Forget
Fibre in your Diet: To Help Avoid Many of Our
Commonest Diseases (Burkitt 1979), and his theories
had a large impact on the general public, as well as
the scientific community. In comparison, many popu-
lar diets in more recent times have focused on low
carbohydrate and low sugars intakes, with a poor per-
ception of starchy carbohydrates as noted in the FSA
surveys.
Awareness of benefits between fibre and chronic
disease risk
Three quarters of the participants regularly provided
advice for patients with CVD and increasing fibre
intake was considered to be highly appropriate advice
for an overweight patient with high blood cholesterol
by most (60%) respondents (a similar proportion to
reducing sugars intake). With regard to foods for
cholesterol lowering, only a quarter of the nurses
would recommend oats, although this was reported
more frequently than plant sterols and stanols (22%),
nuts
(12%),
probiotic
yogurts
(12%)
and
soya-
containing foods (8%).
Almost all nurses regularly provided dietary advice
for patients with diabetes and obesity. When presented
with a case study of an obese patient with fasting
blood glucose levels indicative of impaired glucose tol-
erance and asked about highly appropriate dietary
changes, the most commonly cited were reducing sug-
ars and eating more vegetables (with fruit less strongly
recommended). Eating more fibre was also considered

 a highly or somewhat appropriate dietary change by
around 90% of the participants, but 8% reported
being unsure as to whether such advice was suitable.
Two-thirds of nurses considered increasing dietary
fibre as highly appropriate advice for reducing risk of
colorectal cancer, but they reported increasing fruit
and vegetable intake, and reducing saturated fatty acid
and alcohol intake more frequently.
Practical fibre knowledge – nurses’ awareness of
fibre-containing foods
From a list of mixed foods, most nurses were able to
identify those that were high in fibre, but when
unprompted,
participants
were
likely
to
recognise
fruit, vegetables and wholegrains for increasing fibre
intakes, but less likely to suggest other fibre-containing
foods such as nuts, seeds and pulses (although interest-
ingly many nurses indicated from a list of given tips
that adding pulses to stews was a dietary change they
would advise to increase fibre). Just over half of nurses
said they would encourage their patients to choose
foods labelled ‘high in fibre’.
Some of the barriers suggested by the answers from
the survey to providing dietary advice included lack of
time during appointments and the feeling that patients
would be dissatisfied with a concentration on lifestyle
modification rather than a medical prescription.
Conclusion
The review of Carbohydrates and Health, published
last year by SACN (SACN 2015), emphasised the
importance of dietary fibre in relation to health, con-
cluding that there is an association between high fibre
intake and lower risk of CVD, type 2 diabetes and
colorectal cancer. Whilst links between fibre and
markers of gastrointestinal health have been demon-
strated, further experimental evidence is required to
determine the exact mechanisms that may be responsi-
ble for type 2 diabetes and CVD risk reduction. Such
evidence could be instrumental in informing future
EFSA health claims.
Most people in the UK will need to make substan-
tial changes to their diet in order to achieve the new
recommendation for adults of 30 g of fibre/day. This
will require basing meals on starchy foods (predomi-
nantly wholegrain), consuming plenty of fruit and
vegetables and a variety of other high-fibre foods and
snacks. Unfortunately, whilst the importance of con-
suming 5 A DAY is well recognised by the public, per-
ceptions of starchy carbohydrates are often poor as a
result of negative media coverage and weight loss diets
(i.e. low-carbohydrate diets) that suggest starchy foods
to be ‘fattening’ and lead to weight gain if consumed
frequently.
Evaluation of schemes, such as the Whole Grain
Stamp in the US and Nordic Keyhole labelling, suggest
that clearly recognisable signposting of the nutritional
quality of foods (e.g. contains wholegrain, high fibre)
can be effective in increasing awareness of health ben-
efits amongst consumers. Promotion of good dietary
patterns, as depicted by the recently launched Eatwell
Guide, which includes plenty of fruit and vegetables,
wholegrain and high-fibre starchy foods, beans, peas,
lentils, nuts and seeds will increase fibre in the diet, as
well as dietary quality via the displacement of calorie-
dense, nutrient-poor foods. Educating the consumer is
therefore important. However, knowledge is rarely
enough to elicit behaviour change. Awareness of the 5
A DAY message is high but, as a nation, we are still
not achieving this target. As outlined in this paper,
there are a significant number of barriers for many
consumers to overcome to achieve a diet containing
the variety of fibre-rich foods to promote good health.
Improving the availability of fibre-rich foods that are
accessible, affordable and desirable will be important.
For example, offering wholegrain and high-fibre starchy
foods in restaurants and cafes could help to increase
consumer familiarity and enjoyment of these options.
Although innovation to incorporate high-fibre ingredi-
ents into widely consumed products may also support
increased intakes, it is important to determine whether
addition of fibre isolates can bring the same health
benefits as foods in which fibre is present as a naturally
integrated component. Whilst there is evidence that
particular extracted and isolated fibres have positive
effects on blood lipids and colorectal function (e.g.
beta-glucan), due to the smaller evidence base, it is not
known whether these components confer the full range
of health benefits associated with the consumption of a
mix of dietary fibre-rich foods; therefore, it is not
advisable that stand-alone fibre isolate products are
used as a substitute for a healthy, balanced diet.
Barriers relating to food labelling have also been
recognised by SACN, with one of its research recom-
mendations in Carbohydrates and Health stating that
a standardised definition of ‘wholegrain’ and whole-
grain foods should be developed, both to facilitate rec-
ommended portion sizes for wholegrain foods and to
complement public health messages about the impor-
tance of dietary fibre.

 importance of high-fibre diets, as well as trained in the
delivery of practical healthy eating messages as part of
their initial and Continued Professional Development
is of utmost importance. Resources, such as the new
Eatwell Guide, with its emphasis on high-fibre starchy
foods, fruit and vegetables and plant-based sources of
protein as the basis for healthy eating patterns, are
valuable tools but it is likely that more will need to be
done to support the key messages of this food model,
particularly
to
address
common
misconceptions
around starchy carbohydrates. Training and resources
are needed to help redress the balance in an environ-
ment where there is a strong focus on the need for
sugars reduction, perpetuated by the media, which is
overshadowing the importance of other aspects of the
diet including dietary fibre. Messages around dietary
patterns, rather than single nutrients, are likely to
encourage dietary changes that support greater reduc-
tion of chronic disease in the UK.
