Abstract
Background: The German cockroach, Blattella germanica, is one of the most challenging pests to eradicate from
indoor environments. Professional pest control is often prohibitively expensive, prompting low-income residents to
turn to over-the-counter consumer products, including total release foggers (TRFs, “bug bombs”). Despite their
widespread use, little is known regarding either the associated pesticide exposure risks or the efficacy of TRFs.
Methods: Cockroach-infested homes were recruited into the study. Wipe samples were collected from various surfaces
before TRFs were discharged, immediately after, and one month later to determine pesticide exposure risks in 20
homes (divided equally among four different TRF products). Simultaneously, cockroach populations were monitored in
all homes to assess the efficacy of TRFs. In parallel, 10 homes were treated with gel baits (divided equally between two
bait products), to compare TRFs to a more targeted, low-risk, do-it-yourself intervention strategy.
Results: TRFs failed to reduce cockroach populations, whereas similarly priced gel baits caused significant declines in
the cockroach populations. Use of TRFs resulted in significant pesticide deposits throughout the kitchen. Across all
products, pesticides, and horizontal kitchen surfaces, pesticide residues following TRF discharge were 603-times
(SEM ±184) higher than baseline, with a median increase of 85 times.
Conclusions: The high risks of pesticide exposure associated with TRFs combined with their ineffectiveness in
controlling German cockroach infestations call into question their utility in the marketplace, especially because
similarly priced and much safer bait products are highly effective in the indoor environment.

Background
In the United States alone, 82 million households used in-
secticides in 2012 and $2.65 billion were spent in the
“home and garden sector”, representing 50% of all expen-
ditures on insecticides [1]. One of the most prominent
pests targeted with insecticides is the German cockroach
(Blattella germanica). There are many reasons for elimin-
ating indoor cockroach infestations, but primary among
them is the central role that cockroaches play as etio-
logical agents in allergic disease and asthma [2]. Allergens
produced by German cockroaches can trigger allergies
and asthma in sensitized individuals, and the National Co-
operative Inner-City Asthma Study found that asthma
morbidity was highest in children that experienced both a
positive skin-test response and high exposure to cock-
roach allergens [3]. The National Survey of Lead and Al-
lergens in Housing, a nationwide survey conducted by the
U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences
(NIEHS) and the U.S. Department for Housing and Urban
Development (HUD), found detectable levels of the cock-
roach allergen Bla g 1 in 63% of homes [4], with higher
concentrations in high-rise apartments, urban settings,
older homes, and low-income households [4, 5]. More-
over, because cockroaches move freely between waste and
food, they can acquire, carry, and disseminate pathogenic
bacteria, helminths, fungi, protozoa, and viruses in their

 digestive system [6]. Thus, the persistence of cockroaches
in homes poses significant health risks to humans.
Indoor cockroach infestations are often targeted with re-
sidual liquid or aerosol sprays that contain broad-spectrum
insecticides, most commonly pyrethroids [7]. However,
high levels of resistance to pyrethroids and their repellency
to cockroaches severely compromise the efficacy of most
residual sprays [7]. Moreover, these products can deposit
considerable insecticide residues throughout the home [8].
Environmental data collected by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) and HUD on a stratified, nation-
ally representative sample of 1131 residences found exten-
sive pesticide residues in homes [9]. Despite the continual
use of residual sprays, insecticides formulated as baits offer
more effective and safer alternatives in cockroach interven-
tions [10, 11].
Because professional pest control interventions can be
prohibitively expensive, consumer-based pesticide prod-
ucts are commonly used in do-it-yourself (DIY) pest
control, especially in low-income homes. Total-release
foggers (TRFs) are often deployed as spatial insecticides,
designed to fill a room with fine particles of aerosolized
insecticide. They are considered by consumers to be
highly effective against all pests (as the common name
“bug bomb” implies). TRFs generally contain toxicity
category III (based on acute toxicity) active ingredients
(pyrethrins and pyrethroids), various synergists meant to
inhibit microsomal detoxification by insects, and aerosol
propellants that are often flammable. These products are
responsible for substantial acute and chronic health ef-
fects, explosions and fires, and persistent environmental
contamination indoors. These effects were first charac-
terized by a 2008 US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) report that summarized 466 fogger
exposures in eight States over a five-year period, docu-
menting respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, ocu-
lar, dermatologic, and cardiovascular adverse symptoms
[12]. A similar summary from Texas, USA documented
2855 fogger exposures over an 8-year period [13]. Des-
pite these reports, the magnitude of health, economic,
and environmental damage is poorly documented, and
likely underestimated. Indeed, a follow-up report from
the New York City Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene, USA [14] stated that the 2008 CDC report un-
derstated reported exposures. This follow-up report also
showed that health effects are much more likely to occur
from exposures to TRFs than from other pesticide for-
mulations, and moderate or major health effects were
more than twice as likely to occur from TRF exposures
as from all pesticides, and seven times as likely as from
rodenticides. While many of the fogger-associated ill-
nesses and injuries result from inadvertent exposures
during their deployment (leaving the premises too late,
re-entering too soon, discharging too many foggers,
failing to notify others), studies suggest that TRFs de-
posit large amounts of insecticides in areas easily access-
ible to humans, especially small children [8, 15]. The
residual pyrethroids on household surfaces can exacer-
bate a number of chronic health conditions [16], al-
though the health effects from chronic exposure are still
under debate.
TRF products appear to contribute significantly to the
disproportional pesticide exposure already documented
for those living in affordable housing [17, 18]. The report
from New York City’s Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene [14] contends that “the health risks associated
with the use of foggers are not justified given their likely
poor efficacy”. Recently, Jones and Bryant [19] showed
that over-the-counter TRFs were indeed ineffective at
controlling bed bug infestations. Surprisingly however,
there are no reports on the relative efficacy of modern
TRF products against their primary target, the German
cockroach. Therefore, we designed a study to assess the
efficacy and exposure risks of TRFs in cockroach-infested
homes.
Methods
Ethics statement
The North Carolina State University Institutional Review
Board (IRB) approved this study (#1459). Before participa-
tion, adult participants (> 21 yrs. old) provided written in-
formed consent. Demographic data on participants were
not gathered in this study, as we were interested in a cock-
roach intervention and the environmental outcomes in
cockroach-infested residences, independent of the demog-
raphy of the residents.
Recruitment of participants
Apartments in five low-income communities within the city
of Raleigh NC, U.S.A., were visited and residents were
queried regarding cockroach infestations. Apartments were
in multi-unit low-rise buildings, duplexes, and row homes.
Residents were first informed of the purpose of the study,
provided informed consent, then asked if (a) they had seen
any live cockroaches, and (b) if they were interested in par-
ticipating in the study. If the resident reported seeing cock-
roaches and agreed to participate, the home was visually
inspected for the presence of cockroaches. If the home was
expected to qualify based on sufficient numbers of live Ger-
man cockroaches or evidence of cockroaches, the home
was recruited into the study. Official enrollment followed
standard cockroach population quantification, implemented
through trapping (see “Intervention effectiveness – Assess-
ment of relative cockroach population size” below).
Interventions
Four different TRF products were used, representing
several insecticide active ingredients and manufacturers:

 Hot Shot No-Mess Fogger2 with Odor Neutralizer (Hot
Shot 2; 85 g, 0.333% tetramethrin, 0.834% permethrin,
1.667% piperonyl butoxide; Spectrum Group-United In-
dustries, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.), Hot Shot No-Mess Fog-
ger3 with Odor Neutralizer (Hot Shot 3; 170 g, 0.200%
tetramethrin, 0.860% cypermethrin, 0.500% piperonyl
butoxide; Spectrum Group-United Industries), Raid Max
Concentrated Deep Reach Fogger (Raid Deep; 60 g,
1.716% cypermethrin; SC Johnson, Racine, WI, U.S.A.),
and Raid Fumigator (10 g, 12.600% permethrin; SC
Johnson). Five replicate homes were treated with each
TRF product, one home in each of five apartment com-
plexes (20 TRF-treated homes).
Each TRF was discharged in the kitchen following the
product label instructions and EPA precautions (https://
www.epa.gov/safepestcontrol/safety-precautions-total-re-
lease-foggers; last accessed April 15, 2017). Briefly, all
residents vacated the apartments for 4–6 h, windows
and doors were closed, air conditioning and gas stove
pilot lights were turned off, cabinet doors were opened
and contents as well as immovable kitchen appliances
were covered with newspapers, and aquaria were moved
out of the kitchen. Four to six hours later, the apartment
was ventilated, newspapers discarded, dishes rinsed, and
residents allowed to re-enter.
Running in parallel, 10 additional apartments were
treated with only gel baits. Five homes, one in each apart-
ment complex, were treated with a consumer bait, Com-
bat Gel Bait (0.010% fipronil; Combat Insect Control
Systems-The Dial Corporation, Scottsdale, AZ, U.S.A.),
and another set of five homes, one in each apartment
complex, received a professional bait, Maxforce Gel Bait
(0.010% fipronil; Bayer Environmental Science, Robinson
Township, PA, U.S.A.). Bait was dispensed as needed at
each of three visits (baseline, two weeks, one month). At
the conclusion of the study, all TRF-treated apartments
were provided thorough gel bait interventions.
Intervention effectiveness – Assessment of relative
cockroach population size
At baseline, and subsequently two and four weeks after
treatment, six glue-board sticky-traps (Victor Roach
Pheromone Trap, Woodstream Corporation, Lititz, PA,
U.S.A.) were placed in kitchen locations where cock-
roaches commonly aggregate. The traps were collected
the following day and enumerated in the lab. Changes in
each cockroach population (apartment) were assessed
relative to the baseline trap catch. Homes were enrolled
in the study if at least 50 cockroaches were trapped at
baseline.
TRF efficacy – Caged sentinel cockroaches
After enrollment, cockroaches were collected from the
kitchen using a modified Eureka Mighty-Mite 7.0-A
vacuum
cleaner
(Eureka
Company,
Charlotte,
NC,
U.S.A.).
Live
cockroaches
were
collected
into
a
mesh-lined plastic tube attached to the distal end of the
vacuum’s
extension
tube.
Apartment-collected
male
cockroaches were used as caged sentinels for determin-
ing product efficacy in the same apartment where they
were collected. Prior to discharging the TRF, 40 labora-
tory raised, insecticide-susceptible adult male cock-
roaches and 40 home-specific apartment-collected males
were placed into the home as sentinels. Twenty cock-
roaches from both the laboratory population and the
apartment-specific population were placed in two uncov-
ered cages on the floor 1.0 m away from the TRF (re-
ferred to as “floor”), and the other 20 cockroaches from
each population were placed in two uncovered cages in
an upper cabinet (lowest shelf, referred to as “upper cab-
inet”). The inside walls of the cages were coated with
petroleum jelly to prevent cockroaches from escaping.
Four to six hours after the TRF was discharged, and it
was safe to re-enter the apartment, the sentinel cock-
roaches were collected, returned to the laboratory, trans-
ferred to a clean cage, and assessed for mortality 24 h
later.
Pesticide residue analysis
Kitchens were sampled for insecticide residues at three
time points during the study: before TRF use (baseline),
immediately (4–6 h) after TRF discharge, and one month
later. Areas sampled included the floor at both 0.5 m
and 1.0 m from the site of the TRF, the nearest counter-
top to the TRF (~ 0.9 m high), the inside (base) of an
upper level cabinet (~ 1.4 m), and the nearest wall to the
TRF at a height of 0.9 m (representing the height of a
child). The same areas of the kitchen, but not the same
spots, were sampled at each subsequent visit. Samples
were collected by wiping an area of 100 cm2 with a cot-
ton swab wetted with isopropyl alcohol for 1 min. Each
swab sample was placed into a 20 ml glass vial, immedi-
ately returned to the laboratory and stored at − 30 °C
until extraction.
Swab samples were analyzed for the specific active in-
gredients used in the TRF products, which included per-
methrin (sum of cis- and trans- isomers), cypermethrin
(sum of all isomers), tetramethrin (sum of all isomers),
and PBO (pyrethroid synergist). Additionally, swab sam-
ples were analyzed for fipronil residues (active ingredient
from baits used). Each sample was fortified with 500 ng
of the surrogate recovery standard (SRS) 13C6-trans-per-
methrin (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc., Tewks-
bury,
MA,
U.S.A.).
Samples
were
extracted
and
sonicated twice with ethyl acetate. Solvent volume was
then reduced, and samples were cleaned using a 3 ml
prefabricated solid phase extraction (SPE) column con-
taining 500 mg of silica gel (Supelclean LC-Si SPE Tube,
DeVries et al. BMC Public Health           (2019) 19:96 
Page 3 of 11
 Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). The SPE column
was conditioned with 5 ml of hexane, the sample was
loaded onto the column and eluted with 5 ml of 50%
ether in hexane. Each eluted sample was spiked with
500 ng of the internal standard (IS) 4,4′-dibromobiphe-
nyl (DBBP, AccuStandard Inc., New Haven, CT, U.S.A.),
evaporated to near dryness under nitrogen, resuspended
in 1 ml of hexane, and stored at − 30 °C until analysis.
Samples were analyzed using an Agilent Technologies
6890 GC coupled to an Agilent 5975 mass spectrometer
(GC-MS). The GC was equipped with a 30 m × 0.25
mm × 0.25 μm (5%-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane Agilent
J&W HP-5 ms column preceded by a 3 m deactivated
guard column. The temperature program was: 100 °C for
1 min, then 5 °C/min to 225 °C, then 2 °C/min to 256 °C,
then 10 °C/min to 320 °C where it was held for 10 min.
Mass spectrometry conditions were: transfer line at 280 °
C, ionization source at 230 °C, and quadrupole at 150 °C.
One quantification ion was used for each pesticide
(Table 1). Ten calibration curve solutions ranging from
0.1 μg/ml to 100 μg/ml for all TRF insecticides (Sig-
ma-Aldrich) were used to generate calibration curves via
log-transformed linear regression. Extracted samples
were corrected for both the SRS and IS and quantified
using the calibration curve. Each calibration curve solu-
tion was run a minimum of three times, interspersed
evenly among field-collected samples. If any compound
exceeded the upper point in the calibration curve by
more than 15%, the sample was diluted and re-analyzed.
Method detection limits (MDLs) were determined using
the guidelines from 40 CFR Part 136, Appendix B.
Data analyses
Two-way repeated measures ANOVA was used to com-
pare changes in cockroach population levels over time
(baseline, two weeks, four weeks) among different treat-
ments (TRFs and baits). Due to interactive effects, re-
peated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate changes
in cockroach population within each treatment, with
means
at
different
times
compared
using
the
Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test.
Three-way ANOVA was used to compare sentinel cock-
roach percent mortality (arcsine square root transformed)
among TRF products, population (laboratory-raised or
apartment-collected),
and
location
(floor
or
upper
cabinet).
The effects of each TRF treatment on insecticide resi-
dues were evaluated using repeated measures ANOVA
(within
each
treatment)
on
log-transformed
values.
Treatments were defined by the insecticide(s) in each
TRF product and swab locations quantified over time,
with means at 4–6 h and one month after the TRF inter-
vention compared to the baseline mean using Dunnett’s
test. Prior to log-transformation, all values had the re-
spective insecticide MDL added to them. Comparisons
were also made among swab locations for each TRF
treatment 4–6 h after discharge using ANOVA. Insecti-
cide residues were evaluated only for the Combat gel
bait group, and not the Maxforce bait group, at baseline
and one month. Additionally, three apartments were re-
moved from the study for either failing to complete the
study or not following the approved protocol. Also,
some samples have missing values due to problems with
sample collection or sample analysis (reflected by sample
size).
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, U.S.A.).
Results
Effects of interventions on cockroach populations
There were no significant differences in the baseline
cockroach trap catch, a gauge of population level, among
the treatments (F5,22 = 0.97, p = 0.4553) (Fig. 1a). Cock-
roach trap catch was significantly affected by both treat-
ment and time after intervention (interactive effect);
therefore, the effect of each intervention was analyzed
separately using repeated measures ANOVA. Only the
two bait treatments resulted in significant declines in
trap counts relative to baseline (Combat: F2,8 = 12.40, p
= 0.0035; Maxforce: F2,8 = 21.37, p = 0.0006) at both two-
and four-weeks after the intervention (comparisons of
least square means with Bonferroni correction, Fig. 1b).
Trap counts in all TRF treatments did not change sig-
nificantly from baseline counts (p > 0.25).
Responses of sentinel cockroaches to TRFs
Both the origin of the cockroaches (laboratory or apart-
ments) and the TRF product significantly affected mor-
tality of sentinel cockroaches, while their placement

 (floor or upper cabinet) had no effect (F15,68 = 48.95, p <
0.0001; Table 2). Mean percent mortality was signifi-
cantly higher in the insecticide-susceptible laboratory
cockroaches than in apartment-collected cockroaches.
Despite TRF products having a significant effect on the
model, no TRF product provided > 38% mortality in the
sentinel cockroaches collected in apartments, with some
resulting in < 11% mortality (Fig. 2).
Pesticide residues in kitchens
At baseline, three of the four TRF active ingredients
(PBO, permethrin, cypermethrin) were detected in > 86%
of the surface swabs (Table 3). Permethrin was detected
at the highest frequency (> 91% of all surface swabs),
while cypermethrin was detected at the highest average
concentration at baseline (> 10 ng/cm2 for all swab loca-
tions, Table 3). Tetramethrin was detected, but at much
lower rates than the other TRF active ingredients (< 38%
for all swab locations, Table 3). Fipronil was not detected
in any of the baseline samples we swabbed from five dif-
ferent surfaces in the kitchen (0.5 m, 1.0 m, counter, cab-
inet, wall).
Total release foggers deposited significant amounts of
insecticide residues on all horizontal kitchen surfaces
(Fig. 3). Of the 32 combinations of insecticide by swab
location on horizontal surfaces (e.g. PBO at 0.5 m, per-
methrin on the kitchen counter, etc.), 27 (84%) had sig-
nificant increases (p < 0.05) in residues 4–6 h after the
TRF was discharged (94% had moderate increases in
insecticide residues, p < 0.1). The average increase in in-
secticide residues on horizontal surfaces 4–6 h after TRF
discharge was 603 ± 184 (SEM) times, with a median in-
crease of 85 times relative to baseline. After one month,
34% had significantly higher residues relative to baseline
levels (50% had moderate increases).
None of the insecticide by wall sample combinations
(vertical surfaces) had significant elevation in pesticide
residues 4–6 h after TRF discharge (3 [38%] had moder-
ate increases, Fig. 3). After one month, one (13%) in-
secticide by wall sample combination had significantly
elevated pesticide residues relative to baseline (2 [25%]
had moderate increases).
Pesticide residues 4–6 h after TRF discharge varied
significantly across sampling locations within the kitchen
(p < 0.0076 for all 8 TRF-specific pesticides), with all
horizontal surfaces accumulating significantly more in-
secticide than the wall (p < 0.0236 for all, Tukey’s test).
By contrast, there were no significant changes in pyr-
ethroid and PBO residues in the bait-only intervention
(p > 0.3668 for all pesticides studied). Fipronil, the active
ingredient in baits, was not detected on these surfaces in
any of the bait-treated kitchens either at baseline or one
month after bait was applied.
Economic analysis
The applied material cost of TRFs (in US dollars) ranged
from $2.6 to $4.2 per apartment, while gel baits were
higher ($11.9 to $16.0, Table 4). However, consumers
typically cannot purchase TRFs individually, thus a more
realistic comparison would be the realized cost (see
Table 4 for equation), which ranged from $7.8 to $12.5,
while gel baits ranged from $14.0 to $23.4. Time esti-
mates to complete the interventions were 6 h for TRFs
and 2 h for gel baits. TRFs required extensive prepar-
ation time (estimated at 1 h), a minimum of 4 h during
discharge when residents must vacate the home, and ex-
tensive cleanup following deployment (estimated at 1 h).
Bait placement was much less time consuming, with
maximum time required for application estimated at 1 h,
followed by 0.5 h commitments at two-and four-weeks
after the initial application.
Discussion
TRFs are ineffective at reducing German cockroach
infestations
This study provides the first concurrent documenta-
tion
of
the
risks
associated
with TRFs
and
the
ineffectiveness of TRFs at controlling German cock-
roaches. All TRF products evaluated failed to reduce
cockroach populations, providing to our knowledge
the first conclusive in-home evidence that these prod-
ucts are inappropriate tools for abatement of German
cockroach infestations. Results from population moni-
toring with traps provided insight into the ineffective-
ness
of
the TRF
intervention
under
“real
world”
conditions. To test the efficacy of TRFs under ideal condi-
tions, we used laboratory-reared and apartment-collected

 cockroaches as sentinels in open-top cages during the dis-
charge of TRFs. Whereas all the TRF products killed the
insecticide-susceptible laboratory-reared cockroaches, <
38% of the apartment-collected cockroaches died, clearly
demonstrating the lack of efficacy of this approach even
under ideal conditions.
The overall ineffectiveness of TRFs may be caused by
any one or combination of the following factors. First,
pyrethroid insecticides are known to be repellent to
cockroaches [20–22]. While the sentinel cockroaches
could not escape the insecticide deposits from TRFs, the
wild cockroaches could behaviorally avoid the insecticide
residues. Second, aerosolized particles from TRFs likely
failed to reach places where cockroaches normally shel-
ter. We found relatively little insecticide residues on
walls near the TRF discharge sites, compared to horizon-
tal surfaces. Since cockroaches are often found under
horizontal surfaces (e.g., under the kitchen sink, under
countertops, under shelves), they likely avoid the large
insecticide deposits on the tops of horizontal surfaces.
Finally, and most significantly, extensive and pervasive
pyrethroid resistance has evolved in German cockroach
populations over the last 3 decades [23–26], rendering
even residual spray formulations, which deliver pyre-
throids directly to aggregation and foraging sites, inef-
fective in cockroach abatement [10]. The differential
mortality of the insecticide-susceptible laboratory cock-
roaches
and
the
adjacent
wild
cockroaches
in
open-topped cages suggests that the latter might be re-
sistant to pyrethroid insecticides.

Fogger2 with Odor Neutralizer, b Hot Shot No-Mess Fogger3 with Odor Neutralizer, c Raid Max Concentrated Deep Reach Fogger, and d Raid Fumigator.
Insecticide residues were measured at baseline, 4 h post-discharge, and 1 month post-TRF intervention. Sites swabbed for insecticide residues included the
floor at 0.5 m and 1 m from the TRF discharge site (middle of the kitchen), the nearest countertop to the TRF discharge site, the inside of an upper level
cabinet, and the nearest wall to the TRF discharge site at a height of 90 cm from the floor. Error bars represent SEM. Significant differences in insecticide
concentrations compared to baseline levels (as determined by Dunnett’s test) are indicated with * (p < 0.1) or ** (p < 0.05)

 TRFs deposit substantial insecticide residues
All TRF products significantly elevated insecticide resi-
dues in homes. With an average increase in insecticide
residues of over 600-fold (median 85-fold) for all TRF
products, insecticide active ingredients, and horizontal
surfaces, it is clear that TRFs can cause significant insecti-
cide contamination in homes. Although the insecticide
residues declined after one month, significantly higher
levels, relative to baseline, persisted on > 34% of kitchen
surfaces. Our results for cypermethrin residues on hori-
zontal surfaces (0.13–0.75 μg/cm2, depending on the TRF
product and substrate) were comparable to those of
Keenan et al. [15] who found 0.07–0.38 μg/cm2 after a
similar TRF discharge. TRF deposits were also found to
settle relatively evenly on all horizontal surfaces (floor: 0.5
m and 1 m from the TRF; countertop; upper cabinet) 4–6
h after discharge, and much less on walls, also shown by
Keenan et al. [8]. The high concentrations of pesticide
residues in the middle of the kitchen floor, where
cockroaches do not aggregate and seldom forage, and
low deposits on vertical surfaces where cockroaches
often aggregate [7], likely contributed to the ineffect-
iveness of TRFs.
Considering the extensive deposits of insecticides from
the discharge of a single TRF, it is not surprising that
many studies, including ours, have found quantifiable
“baseline” amounts of a variety of pesticides in homes
(including pyrethroids and PBO), without implementing
any pest control intervention [9, 17, 27, 28]. A compari-
son of the floor baseline results from the current study
with those reported by Stout et al. [9] reveals some not-
able trends. First, detection frequencies for all TRF ac-
tive ingredients were either the same or higher in our
study compared with Stout et al. [9]. Our study found
higher detection rates for PBO and cypermethrin, while
detection rates for permethrin and tetramethrin were
within 5%. However, Stout et al. [9] detected fipronil
more often. Our MDLs were generally higher than re-
ported by Stout et al. [9], who also sampled surfaces al-
most 10-fold larger than we did, which could account
for our lower incidence of detecting fipronil residues at
baseline. For three other insecticides, however, the geo-
metric means were 6- (permethrin), 199- (PBO), and
237-times (cypermethrin) higher in the current study
than in Stout et al. [9] (fipronil and tetramethrin were
not compared because both were detected at low fre-
quencies in our study). The prevalence of pyrethroid in-
secticides on kitchen surfaces is particularly remarkable
because all our recruited homes were in low-income
housing complexes and of lower socio-economic status
(SES). In contrast, the homes sampled by Stout et al. [9]
represented a random sample of public and private
housing units across the U.S. The disparity of these re-
spective studies appears to support previous findings of
disproportionate pesticide exposure risks associated with
lower SES [29–31]. Future work should focus on better
understanding the relationship between pesticide expos-
ure risk and SES.
Baits: High efficacy and low pesticide residues
In contrast to the TRF formulations, both consumer--
based gel bait (Combat) and professional gel bait (Max-
force) were highly effective at reducing the cockroach
infestations, as expected based on previous uses of this
strategy to mitigate German cockroaches and cock-
roach-produced allergens [7, 10, 11]. In the current
study, baits were used alone, independently of all other
integrated pest management (IPM) tactics. Although
cockroach reduction was significant among all bait
treated homes, populations were not completely eradi-
cated within one month. It is important to note that for
complete eradication, inspection and treatment (baiting)
would need to continue for longer than the one-month
period of this study [32, 33]. Moreover, fipronil (the ac-
tive ingredient in both bait products) was not detected
in swabs in any of the bait-treated apartments, consist-
ent with the findings of Williams et al. [11] that indoor
environments under IPM programs involving baits had
much lower pesticide residues compared with traditional
spray treatments. Furthermore, both TRFs and baits
were similarly priced (see Table 4), indicating that cost
should not factor into the decision regarding which
product to use.
Our effective use of gel baits as a single monitoring--
guided intervention, independent of other IPM tactics
(e.g., caulking, sanitation, cleaning, trapping), is consist-
ent with an emergent body of literature showing that
proper use of baits constitutes the most cost-effective
intervention to mitigate the harmful effects of cock-
roaches and their allergens [reviews: 2, 7]. While more
comprehensive IPM approaches e.g. [34, 35, 36] may se-
cure faster and more effective cockroach reductions, the
additional costs associated with materials, labor, and ad-
ministrative matters can make them less practical in
many real-world situations.
Conclusions
It has been over 25 years since Fenske [37] suggested
several strategies to mitigate risks associated with indoor
pesticide applications, including that “product registra-
tions could be modified or withdrawn for specific appli-
cations
if
an
acceptable
level
of
risk
cannot
be
demonstrated.” Although his work focused on active in-
gredients that in fact have been withdrawn from indoor
use, the narrative remains the same – TRF products are
depositing
large
amounts
of
insecticide
residues
throughout the home. We now show that TRFs provide
no

 infestations. Their associated societal costs, lack of observ-
able benefits, and the availability of highly efficacious, af-
fordable, and environmentally sound alternatives, such as
baits, challenge the continued registration and persistence
of TRF products in the consumer market.
Study limitations
This study had several limitations, none of which under-
mine our conclusions. First, this study was limited to a
relatively small sample size of homes treated with TRFs,
because of IRB concerns with the invasiveness and ex-
pected low efficacy of this intervention. Nevertheless,
the sample size provided strong statistical power and
showed highly significant differences in pesticide resi-
dues on hard surfaces in homes and in the efficacy of pest
control options. Second, the homes sampled were located
within a single city (Raleigh, NC, U.S.A.), potentially rais-
ing reservations whether our findings may be generalized
globally. It is important to note that the apartments within
this city represented a broad range of independent and
unrelated low-income apartment complexes, and pervious
research showed a general lack of gene flow among
cockroaches in different apartment complexes and no pat-
tern of isolation-by-distance [38], suggesting that these
five apartment complexes represented independent cock-
roach populations. Furthermore, our conclusions are
generalizable to a global scale because they are supported
by (a) residue sampling from 2009 to 2010 in California,
with essentially identical active ingredients [15], and (b)
surveys documenting pyrethroid resistance in cockroaches
on a global scale [23–26].
