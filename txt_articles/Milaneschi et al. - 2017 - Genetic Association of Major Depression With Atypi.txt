IMPORTANCE The association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and obesity may
stem from shared immunometabolic mechanisms particularly evident in MDD with atypical
features, characterized by increased appetite and/or weight (A/W) during an active episode.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether subgroups of patients with MDD stratified according to the
A/W criterion had a different degree of genetic overlap with obesity-related traits (body mass
index [BMI] and levels of C-reactive protein [CRP] and leptin).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS This multicenter study assembled genome-wide genotypic
and phenotypic measures from 14 data sets of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. Data
sets were drawn from case-control, cohort, and population-based studies, including 26 628
participants with established psychiatric diagnoses and genome-wide genotype data. Data on
BMI were available for 15 237 participants. Data were retrieved and analyzed from September
28, 2015, through May 20, 2017.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Lifetime DSM-IV MDD was diagnosed using structured
diagnostic instruments. Patients with MDD were stratified into subgroups according to
change in the DSM-IV A/W symptoms as decreased or increased.
RESULTS Data included 11 837 participants with MDD and 14 791 control individuals, for a
total of 26 628 participants (59.1% female and 40.9% male). Among participants with MDD,
5347 (45.2%) were classified in the decreased A/W and 1871 (15.8%) in the increased A/W
subgroups. Common genetic variants explained approximately 10% of the heritability in the
2 subgroups. The increased A/W subgroup showed a strong and positive genetic correlation
(SE) with BMI (0.53 [0.15]; P = 6.3 × 10−4), whereas the decreased A/W subgroup showed an
inverse correlation (−0.28 [0.14]; P = .06). Furthermore, the decreased A/W subgroup had a
higher polygenic risk for increased BMI (odds ratio [OR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.25; P = 1.6 × 10−10)
and levels of CRP (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.13; P = 7.3 × 10−3) and leptin (OR, 1.09; 95% CI,
1.06-1.12; P = 1.7 × 10−3).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The phenotypic associations between atypical depressive
symptoms and obesity-related traits may arise from shared pathophysiologic mechanisms
in patients with MDD. Development of treatments effectively targeting immunometabolic
dysregulations may benefit patients with depression and obesity, both syndromes with
important disability.

pidemiologic evidence has identified robust associa-
tions between depression and obesity.1,2 This link may
be attributable to shared pathophysiologic mecha-
nisms, such as immunometabolic pathways characterized by
increased proinflammatory response and dysregulation of ho-
meostatic hormones responsible for energy metabolism.3 Obe-
sityischaracterizedbylow-gradeproinflammatoryactivation.4
Peripheral immune activation could trigger brain inflamma-
tory responses participating in depressive neurochemical
and/or endocrine processes (ie, depletion and degradation of
tryptophan toward neurotoxic end products5 or hyperactiva-
tion of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis6). Disrupted
centralsignalingoftheadipocyte-derivedhormoneleptin(sup-
pressing food intake and promoting energy expenditure7) may
influence mood. Development of central functional resis-
tance blunts leptin anorexigenic (disinhibiting feeding7), pro-
cognitive, and antidepressant effects.8-10 Leptin mood regu-
lation may be exerted directly via receptors expressed in the
hippocampus and amygdala by influencing neurogenesis and
neuroplasticity in the hippocampus and cortex or by modu-
lating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.11-13
Establishingtheroleindepressionofsuchmechanismshas
beendifficult.Althoughmeta-analyticevidenceprovidesmean
effect sizes, strength and direction of the associations of de-
pressionwithobesity-relatedindexesandbiomarkersmayvary
considerably across different subgroups of patients owing to
clinical heterogeneity. In the past decade, evidence has
emerged suggesting that the link between depression and im-
munometabolicdysregulationsisstronger,orspecific,forMDD
withatypicalfeatures,suchasincreasedappetiteand/orweight
(A/W)andhypersomnia.14-23Otherclinicalcharacteristicslinked
to atypical depression are preponderance of female sex, ear-
lierageatonset,andhigherseverity.24,25Specificatypicalsymp-
toms may constitute major axes of variation for the associa-
tions of MDD with obesity-related features. Recently, the
NetherlandsStudyofDepressionandAnxiety(NESDA)showed
thatincreasedappetiteduringanactivedepressiveepisodewas
more strongly associated with body mass index (BMI) and lev-
els of C-reactive protein (CRP)26 and leptin.27 Other atypical
symptoms that commonly cluster with increased appetite
showed a weaker association (increased weight)27 or no asso-
ciation(hypersomnia)26,27withthesemarkers.Whetherthisco-
variance between depressive symptoms and obesity-related
traits reflects shared genetic liabilities needs to be established.
In prior work28,29 including approximately 3000 Dutch indi-
viduals, the contribution of BMI risk variants could be specifi-
cally detected only in patients with MDD who endorsed in-
creased A/W symptoms.
In the present study, we scaled up genetic analyses to more
than 25 000 samples from different countries from the Psy-
chiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) with established psychi-
atric diagnoses and genome-wide association study (GWAS)
data. Compared with the latest study,29 we were able to esti-
mate the genetic correlations between BMI and MDD sub-
groups.Furthermore,wederivedpolygenicriskscoreswithen-
hanced predictive accuracy owing to larger discovery samples
andnewlydevelopedmethods.Finally,weincludedleptinpoly-
genic risk scores previously not investigated. First, after strati-
fying patients according to A/W symptoms during the MDD in-
dex episodes, we validated the resulting subgroups against
establishedclinicalcharacteristics.Next,weestimatedthecon-
tribution of common genetic variants to the underlying liabili-
ties of the subgroups and their reciprocal correlations. Fi-
nally,wetestedwhetherthesubgroupshadadifferentialgenetic
overlap with BMI and levels of CRP and leptin. Based on pre-
viousfindings,28,29wehypothesizedaspecificunderlyingcon-

Methods
Study Sample
Data were derived from the PGC MDD Working Group (PGC-
MDD2) (http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/24
/167577), which assembled genome-wide genotypic and
phenotypic measures from 29 data sets (24 contributing
cohorts), including 42 455 samples of European ancestry.
Eleven data sets did not provide DSM items coding for A/W;
in addition, 4 data sets were excluded owing to very low
endorsement (<14 samples) of A/W symptoms. Thus, the main
analytic sample (Table 1) was based on the remaining 14 data
sets totaling 26 628 participants, of whom 11 837 had MDD
(cases diagnosed according to DSM-IV lifetime MDD using
structured diagnostic instruments, clinician-administered
DSM-IV checklists, or medical record) and 14 791 were control
individuals (screened in 11 of 14 data sets). Data collection was
approved by each center’
s local institutional review board or
medical ethics committee (all participating centers are listed
at the end of the article), which waived the need for informed
consent for use of the deidentified data sets.
Stratification of MDD Cases
Data were retrieved and analyzed from September 28, 2015,
through May 20, 2017. The selected data sets included infor-
mation on DSM-IV MDD symptoms endorsed during the in-
dex depressive episode. Items on neurovegetative symptoms
were disaggregated to code separately for increase and de-
crease. As in previous work,29 stratification of MDD cases in
Key Points
Question Is the genetic overlap with obesity-related traits (body
mass index and levels of C-reactive protein and leptin) stronger in
patients with major depression and the atypical symptoms of
increased appetite and/or weight during an active episode?
Findings Data from a large international consortium showed that
patients with depression and increased appetite and/or weight
(approximately 15% of cases) carried a higher number of genetic
risk variants for body mass index and levels of C-reactive protein
and leptin.
Meaning The established phenotypic associations between
atypical depressive symptoms and obesity-related traits may arise
from shared pathophysiologic mechanisms, and development of
treatments effectively targeting immunometabolic dysregulations
may benefit this subgroup of patients.

 all data sets was based on 2 items coding separately for de-
crease in A/W and increase in A/W. Among the patients with
MDD, the following 3 subgroups were identified (Table 1 and
eMethods1intheSupplement):decreasedA/W(5347[45.2%]),
no change (3421 [28.9%]), and increased A/W (1871 [15.8%]).
Additional Phenotypes
Information on age at onset was available for 10 452 patients
with MDD (eTable 1 in the Supplement). The number of en-
dorsed symptoms calculated as the sum of DSM-IV–positive
criteria (range, 5-12; 3 symptoms disaggregated in 6 items cod-
ing separately for increase or decrease) to index overall sever-
itywasavailablein10 991cases.AnalysesusingBMIwerebased
on 2 panels of data sets, including 9 data sets providing BMI
for 15 237 samples (42%-100% of the samples across data sets;
the GlaxoSmithKline/Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry and
Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression
studies were excluded owing to lack of BMI data; the Bonn/
Mannheim Study, RADIANT–United Kingdom, and RADIANT-
Germany were excluded owing to availability of BMI in <18%
of samples) and 7 data sets providing BMI for 13 448 samples
(83%-100% of the samples across data sets; additional re-
moval of Genetics of Recurrent Early-Onset Depression stud-
ies 1 and 2 providing BMI only in cases).
Genotype Data Selection
Genotype data underwent centralized quality control and im-
putationasextensivelydescribedinthePGC-MDD2GWAS(http:
//www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/24/167577). Two
panelsofsingle-nucleotidepolymorphisms(SNPs)wereselected
for the present analyses (eMethods 1 in the Supplement). The
first panel of 1 169 543 SNPs passing postimputation quality
control in at least 2 of 14 data sets and present in the HapMap3
reference was selected to build a genomic relationship matrix
(eTable 2 in the Supplement). The second panel of 2 548 638
SNPs passing quality control in all 14 data sets constituted the
base to build genomic profile risk scores (GPRSs).
Genomic Profile Risk Scores
We used GWAS meta-analyses from large international con-
sortia to generate the following obesity-related trait GPRSs
(eMethods 1 in the Supplement): BMI (approximately 160 000
samples)30 and circulating blood concentrations of CRP (ap-
proximately70 000samples),31leptin,andBMI-adjustedleptin
(approximately32 000samples).32PsychiatrictraitGPRSswere

patientsand110 000controls)(http://www.biorxiv.org/content
/early/2017/07/24/167577). Overlapping SNPs (approximately
400 000 to 700 000) between the approximately 2.5 million
selectedandthosefilteredfromthediscoveryGWASwereused

Differences in sex, age at onset, number of DSM-IV symptoms, and sex-adjusted
body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
meters squared) are shown across subgroups of patients with major depressive
disorder (MDD). The patients were compared by subgroups with increased
appetite and/or weight symptoms (A/W), decreased A/W, or no change using
generalized linear mixed models. A, Raw data for female patients include 3758
(70.3%) for the decreased A/W subgroup, 2141 (62.6%) for the no-change
subgroup, and 1430 (76.4%) for the increased A/W subgroup. B, Estimated
mean (SE) age at onset was 30.1 (2.3) years in the decreased A/W subgroup,
29.7 (2.3) years in the no-change subgroup, and 29.2 (2.3) years in the increased
A/W subgroup. C, Estimated mean (SE) number of symptoms was 7.9 (0.1) in the
decreased A/W subgroup, 6.7 (0.1) in the no-change subgroup, and 7.9 (0.1) in
the increased A/W subgroup. D, Sex-adjusted BMI analyses included 9 of 14 data
sets providing BMI data for more than 80% of patients. Estimated mean (SE)
sex-adjusted BMIs were 27.3 (0.5) in the decreased A/W subgroup, 27.4 (0.5) in
the no-change subgroup, and 30.2 (0.5) in the increased A/W. Error bars

 MDD Subgroup SNP Heritability and Correlations
Thegenomicrelationshipmatrix–restrictedmaximumlikelihood
analyses(Table2)showedthatthejointeffectofcommonSNPs
(h2-SNP) significantly captured approximately 10% of variance
in liability for MDD and the subgroups (eTable 3 in the
Supplement for h2-SNP at varying lifetime risk). The h2-SNP es-
timates were consistent with those obtained from concurrent
techniques (eMethods 1 in the Supplement). Bivariate genomic
relationship matrix–restricted maximum likelihood analyses
across subgroups showed an rg of 1.00 between the no-change
subgroup and the increased and decreased A/W subgroups. A
smallercorrelation(rg = 0.82),althoughwithlargeSEsowingto
restricted sample sizes, was found between the decreased and
increased A/W and MDD subgroups, suggesting the possibility
ofaspecificsmalldivergencebetweenthese2subgroupsthatoth-
erwise shared most of their genetic background.
Differential Associations With Obesity-Related Liability
To investigate whether the smaller resemblance between the
decreased and increased A/W subgroups could be attributed
to a different underlying liability to obesity, we estimated their
genetic correlation with BMI (estimated h2-SNP = 0.18;
SE = 0.02; P = 2.9 × 10−15). As depicted in Figure 2 (MDD re-
ported as the benchmark), BMI was significantly correlated
with increased A/W (rg = 0.53; SE = 0.16) and inversely corre-
lated with decreased A/W (rg = –0.28; SE = 0.15).
Furthermore, associations with GPRS-LDpred for obesity-
related traits confirmed partially distinct polygenic signatures
(Figure 3 and eTable 4 in the Supplement) for both A/W sub-
groups. The GPRS-LDpred for BMI was significantly associ-
ated with a higher likelihood of increased A/W (OR, 1.18; 95%
CI, 1.12-1.25; h2 for liability = 0.56%) and with a slightly re-
duced likelihood of decreased A/W (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-
0.99; h2 for liability = 0.03%; false discovery rate, q <0.05, ac-
counting for multiple testing) (eMethods 1 in the Supplement).
Moreover, the association between GPRS-LDpred for CRP lev-
els and MDD (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.06; h2 for liabil-
ity = 0.03%) seemed to be completely driven by increased A/W
(OR,1.08;95%CI,1.02-1.13;h2forliability = 0.09%).Finally,in-
creased A/W was associated with GPRS-LDpred for leptin lev-
els (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.06-1.12; h2 for liability = 0.14%) and, al-
thoughwithareducedeffectsize,GPRS-LDpredforleptinlevels
adjusted for BMI (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; h2 for liabil-
ity = 0.07%). Of note, GPRS-LDpred for leptin levels adjusted
for BMI was not associated with BMI (β = 0.07; SE = 0.04;
P = .08).TheassociationsbetweenincreasedA/WandtheGPRS-
LDpred for obesity-related traits were similar across sex (GPRS-
LDpred × sexinteractionterms,P > .3)Insupplementaryanaly-
ses, GPRS-LDpred for MDD and schizophrenia were similarly
associated across subgroups (eTable 4 in the Supplement). For
completeness of information, eTable 5 in the Supplement re-
ports the association between the no-change A/W MDD sub-
group and GPRS-LDpred.
Additional Analyses With GWAS

Discussion
Using data from more than 25 000 samples from the PGC-
MDD2, we examined whether subgroups of patients with MDD
stratified according to the DSM A/W symptoms had a differ-
ent degree of genetic overlap with obesity-related traits. The
findingsshowedthatthederivedsubgroupslargelysharedtheir
genetic background but were specifically divergent in their li-
ability to immunometabolic traits, with approximately 15% of
patients reporting increased A/W symptoms during an active
episode carrying a higher number of common risk variants for
BMI and CRP and leptin levels.
Despite the simple clinical subphenotyping strategy, the
subgroups recapitulated some clinical features that were re-
ported in previous research on classic MDD subtypes; pa-
tients with increased A/W (approximating an atypical sub-
type) were more likely to be female and had an earlier age at
onset, higher severity, and higher BMI.24,25 Common vari-
ants explained approximately 10% of MDD heritability, in line
with the estimation from the latest PGC-MDD2 GWAS (http:
//www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/24/167577). The SNP
heritability was similar for MDD subgroups, indicating an
overall common genetic background. Reciprocal genetic
correlations confirmed the close association of the subgroups.
Nevertheless, the correlation of 0.82 (affected by large
uncertainty owing to limited sample size) for the decreased vs
increased A/W subgroups was suggestive of a possible small
divergencebetweenthese2subgroupsotherwisesharingmost
oftheirgeneticbackground.Wetestedwhetherthisdivergence
was attributable to obesity-related genetic variants of traits.
Results confirmed that BMI had a genetic correlation with
increased A/W. Similarly, the increased A/W subgroup had a
higher genetic risk load for CRP and leptin levels.

bic reward circuitry in response to food stimuli.38
The present findings indicate genetic overlap between in-
creased A/W and immunometabolic traits. Therefore, the phe-
notypicassociationbetweenincreasedA/Wandobesity-related
features may have resulted from shared genetic and biological
pathways(ie,pleiotropy),suchasincreasedinflammationorleptin
systemdysregulation,ratherthanfromanoverrepresentationof
participantswithhigherBMIamongthisMDDsubgroupindepen-
dentfromthesepathways(ie,confounding).The2processescan-
not be disentagled statistically in observational data; if a pleio-
tropicactionbetween2traitsissubsumed,reciprocaladjustment
fortheothertrait(eg,BMI)mayrepresentapotentialbias-inducing
overadjustment.39 The example of leptin is emblematic of con-
sistentpleiotropic(andBMI-independent)actionsatdifferentlev-
els. In animal models, leptin resistance induced through selec-
tivedeletionofleptinreceptorinhypothalamusorhippocampus
andcortexproduceshyperleptinemiawithobesity40ordepres-
sionlike phenotypes, respectively.41,42 Previous results from
NESDA27showedthathyperleptinemiawaslinkedwithincreased
appetite in patients with MDD independently from BMI. In the
presentstudy,increasedA/Wwasalsoassociatedwithapolygenic
score for BMI-adjusted leptin levels.
Although leptin may be an example of pleiotropic action of
common genetic variants influencing increased A/W and obe-
sitythroughspecificpathways(eg,leptineffectindifferentbrain
areas40-42), pleiotropy also may occur when one trait is caus-
allyassociatedwithanothertrait43,44;inthiscase,ageneticover-
lap with inflammation may occur if, for instance, the geneti-
cally determined increase in appetite and feeding would be the
main driver of proinflammatory activation. Reliable discrimi-
nation of different pleiotropy scenarios with recently devel-
oped techniques43 will become possible with the availability in
the future of adequately powered GWAS for MDD subgroups.
By assuming the example of leptin dysregulation as a shared
mechanism,thehypotheticalmodelisthatofasubgroupofpa-
tients expected to show phenotypically average higher appe-
tite and weight compared with others.15 When depression en-
sues, the shared mechanism may become more dysregulated,
and therefore, the behavioral phenotype will be more pro-
nounced during an active episode. We confirmed using NESDA
data (eResults in the Supplement) that the increased A/W sub-
group had significantly higher BMI compared with other pa-
tientswhenthedisorderwasnonactive,butthisdifferencewas
enhanced at the beginning of an active episode mainly owing
to BMI increases in the increased A/W subgroup and decreases
in the decreased A/W subgroup. This theoretical model is also
consistent with the reported moderation effect of depression
ontheassociationofBMIandtheFTOgene(NG_012969.1).45,46
Furthermore,thismodelisconsistentwithaconceptualframe-
work similar to Research Domain Criteria,47 in which biology-
basedmultileveldimensionscutthroughsymptom-basedclini-
cal categories. Obesity and atypical depression may partially
overlap on the dimension of energy homeostasis, which could
be measured at genetic, biomarker (immunometabolic media-
tors), and behavior (appetite and/or feeding) levels.
Limitations
In interpreting results from the present study, some limitations
shouldbeconsidered.First,A/Wsymptomsusedforcasestrati-
ficationwerebasedonasingleMDDepisode(indexlifetimeepi-
sode, generally with the highest severity). Nevertheless, these
symptoms are consistently 75% to 85% stable across MDD epi-
sodes,especiallyatypical-likeincrease,48-50indicatingthatthey
maybeconsideredstablefeaturesofdepressioninanindividual.
Second,thedatastructuredidnotallowustodissociatethespe-
cific effects of appetite from weight. Nevertheless, the correla-
tionbetweenthese2symptomsduringanactiveepisodeishigh,
and previous studies26,29,51 showed that higher genetic burden
for BMI or immunometabolic biomarkers were detected in pa-
tientsidentifiedonlybyappetite.Finally,resultscannotbegen-
eralized to a population of non-European ancestry.
Conclusions
The present findings showed that the increased A/W subgroup
hadaspecificgeneticoverlapwithobesity-relatedtraits.Anim-
portant follow-up study would be the identification of the spe-
cific genetic loci involved using unbiased genome-wide scans.
The present results indicate that at the current stage, stratifi-
cation of the existing MDD GWAS data set is not yet a viable op-
tion, because the reduction in power owing to reduced sample
size would not be compensated by a higher heritability of the
trait (similar to MDD), as shown by the substantially null re-
sults obtained using the present data. The significant locus de-
tected in a case-only GWAS contrasting the decreased and in-
creased A/W subgroups should be considered mainly as a
stimulus to further pursue this analytic strategy in larger data
sets. Furthermore, the present results identified only associa-
tions. Once the specific loci are identified, follow-up func-
tional studies will be needed to elucidate the potential causal
role of the related pathways. Finally, although we specifically
focusedonA/Wsymptoms,futurestudiesshouldconsiderother
axes of variation in the association between MDD and genetic
and biological factors, including other symptoms such as sleep
disturbances or interaction with environmental factors.
The present findings may have important translational im-
plications,providingmoleculargroundtotheobservedhetero-
geneity of response observed in intervention studies. For in-
stance, anti-inflammatory agents have been proposed for
depression treatment, and a recent meta-analysis52 of ran-
domizedplacebo-controlledtrialsindicatedsubstantialhetero-
geneity in their antidepressant effects. Of interest, post hoc
analyses of a previous trial showed that anti-inflammatory

 tify subgroups of patients who may benefit most from a spe-
cific treatment according to a personalized medicine ap-
proach. In the present study, increased A/W symptoms
identified a subgroup of approximately 15% of patients with
MDD with a higher genetic risk for immunometabolic dysregu-
lations. Future clinical trials should plan to test treatment ef-
ficacy across patients with depression stratified according to
this criterion, especially for treatments targeting immuno-
metabolic pathways (eg, anti-inflammatory agents5 or weight
reduction pharmacologic or behavioral interventions with or
without recombinant leptin7). Development of tailored treat-
ments effectively targeting immunometabolic dysregula-
tions may benefit this specific subgroup of patients with MDD
and obesity, both of which are associated with disability.
