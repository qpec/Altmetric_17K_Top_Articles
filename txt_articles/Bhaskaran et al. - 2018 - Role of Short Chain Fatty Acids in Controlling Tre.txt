Interactions between mucosal tissues and commensal microbes control appropriate
host immune responses and inflammation, but very little is known about these
interactions. Here we show that the depletion of resident bacteria using antibiotics
(Abx) causes oral and gut immunopathology during oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC)
infection. Antibiotic treatment causes reduction in the frequency of Foxp3+ regulatory
cells (Tregs) and IL-17A producers, with a concomitant increase in oral tissue pathology.
While C. albicans (CA) is usually controlled in the oral cavity, antibiotic treatment led
to CA dependent oral and gut inflammation. A combination of short chain fatty acids
(SCFA) controlled the pathology in Abx treated mice, correlating to an increase in the
frequency of Foxp3+, IL-17A+, and Foxp3+IL-17A+ double positive (Treg17) cells in
tongue and oral draining lymph nodes. However, SCFA treatment did not fully reverse
the gut inflammation suggesting that resident microbiota have SCFA independent
homeostatic mechanisms in gut mucosa. We also found that SCFA potently induce
Foxp3 and IL-17A expression in CD4+ T cells, depending on the cytokine milieu in vitro.
Depletion of Tregs alone in FDTR mice recapitulated oral inflammation in CA infected
mice, showing that Abx mediated reduction of Tregs was involved in infection induced
pathology. SCFA did not control inflammation in Treg depleted mice in CA infected
FDTR mice, showing that Foxp3+ T cell induction was required for the protective effect
mediated by SCFA. Taken together, our data reveal that SCFA derived from resident
bacteria play a critical role in controlling immunopathology by regulating T cell cytokines
during mucosal infections. This study has broader implications on protective effects of
resident microbiota in regulating pathological infections.

INTRODUCTION
Dysbiosis of resident microbes is unequivocally associated with immune-related disorders and
opportunistic and pathogenic infections (Gallo and Nakatsuji, 2011; Abt et al., 2012; Flint et al.,
2012; Hill et al., 2012; Abt and Artis, 2013; Hill and Artis, 2013; Kamada et al., 2013a,b; Spasova
and Surh, 2014). Resident microbes remain in direct contact with mucosal surfaces, where both

Resident Microbiome Promotes Mucosal Host-Resistance
entities are in continuous and complex interactions to achieve
immune homeostasis and pathogen clearance (Macpherson and
Harris, 2004; Karin et al., 2006; Belkaid and Naik, 2013; Brito
et al., 2013; Huffnagle and Noverr, 2013; Blander et al., 2017).
Qualitative and quantitative regulation of such interactions
is critical for effective immunity without causing excessive
inflammatory responses (Bilate et al., 2016; Calderon-Gomez
et al., 2016; Hegazy et al., 2017; Navabi et al., 2017). Thus resident
microbiota sustain continuous feedback loop mechanisms with
mucosal surfaces, shaping mucosal immunity, and mechanisms
of inflammation and tolerance in the gut. For example, epithelial
glycosylation regulated by resident microbes and group three
innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) control commensal host symbiosis
and anti microbial host responses (Goto et al., 2014, 2016).
Apart from innate immune responses and Immunoglobulin A
(IgA) responses, T cells also play critical roles in these processes.
While resident bacteria specific T cells induce colitis, regulatory
T cells (Tregs) control gut immunopathology (Pandiyan et al.,
2007, 2011b; Izcue et al., 2009). Commensal microbiota have been
shown to direct the development and maintenance of intestinal
Th17 and Treg cells (Ivanov et al., 2009; Littman and Pamer,
2011; Atarashi et al., 2013; Furusawa et al., 2013; Smith et al.,
2013; Singh et al., 2014; Bilate et al., 2016). With regards to Tregs,
there are a few different populations with variable stability of
Foxp3 expression: thymically derived tTregs, peripherally derived
pTregs, and those secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as
IL-10 (Tr1) and TGF-β (Th3). Foxp3+ pTregs are not found
in the thymic environment but, rather, seem to be induced in
peripheral tissues such as gut, in a process that is dependent on
resident microbiota. For example, commensal Bacteroides fragilis
polysaccharide promotes TLR2 dependent development of IL-10
producing Tregs and tolerance in experimental colitis model
(Round et al., 2011). Clostridium sp. promotes the development
of Foxp3 Tregs in colon by inducing TGF-β production in
intestinal epithelial cells (Atarashi et al., 2013). Lastly, resident
microbiota derived short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are shown to
induce Foxp3 expression in CD4+ T cells, and promote function
of Foxp3+Tregs and IL-10 producing Tregs in intestinal lamina
propria (Round et al., 2011; Arpaia et al., 2013; Atarashi et al.,
2013; Smith et al., 2013). Anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs are
known to be partly by inhibition of histone deacetylase (HDAC)
activity (Vinolo et al., 2011). Supporting this mechanism, even
chemical HDAC inhibitors promote Treg functions, and have
beneficial effects on allograft survival and autoimmune diseases
(Beier et al., 2011; Edwards and Pender, 2011; Arpaia et al., 2013).
In the context of pathogenic infections, resident microbiota
have been shown to enhance anti-microbial resistance in some
settings, and trigger autoimmune disease development in others,
likely depending on qualitative and quantitative responses of T
cells (Ivanov et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2011). These studies indicate
that resident microbiota is involved in optimal responses, and
sometimes exaggerated autoimmune responses, by directly or
indirectly modulating T cells through distinct mechanisms.
However, a vast majority of these studies has focused on
intestinal mucosae and their interactions with gut microbiota,
and little is known about host commensal interactions in
oral mucosal microenvironment colonized with millions of
commensal microbes (Aas et al., 2005; Ghannoum et al., 2010;
Ahn et al., 2011), that may be functionally distinct from the
gut (Avila et al., 2009; Zaura et al., 2009; Ghannoum et al.,
2010; Belda-Ferre et al., 2012; Dang et al., 2012; Yamazaki et al.,
2012). Although emerging studies highlight how poly–
microbial
interactions impact the pathogenesis of oral diseases (Shirtliff
et al., 2009; Peters et al., 2012; Wright et al., 2013; Guo et al.,
2014; Murray et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014), the direct effect of such
interactions on host immune cells is less clear. Oral infections and
inflammation have a dramatic impact on overall human health
and have been related adversely to cancer and cardiovascular
disease (Karin et al., 2006). Therefore studies focusing on how
resident microbes govern oral immune homeostasis are urgently
needed. Perturbations in host-commensal homeostasis and Th17
cell/Treg imbalance are associated with oropharyngeal candidiasis
(OPC) infections and periodontitis (Milner et al., 2008; Blaschitz
and Raffatellu, 2010; Darveau, 2010; Garlet et al., 2010; Kanwar
et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011; Pion et al., 2013; Huppler et al., 2012;
Cheng et al., 2014). However, the inter-relationship between
commensal bacteria and host immune cells in oral disease
pathogenesis is unclear. OPC is an opportunistic infection caused
mainly by C. albicans, a commensal fungus that asymptomatically
colonizes ∼60% of healthy individuals. Cancer treatments,
genetic causes, and immunodeficiency (as in HIV infection)
pre-dispose individuals to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis
(CMC) infections (Marodi and Johnston, 2007; Cheng et al.,
2012), causing secondary complications including squamous
cell carcinoma and aneurysms (Huppler et al., 2012). While
antibiotics are long known to increase the infectivity by Candida
in humans and mice (Kennedy and Volz, 1985a,b; Nord and
Heimdahl, 1986; Nord et al., 1986; Kennedy et al., 1987; Pultz
et al., 2005; Peleg et al., 2010), mechanisms are not fully explored.
We and others have previously shown a mechanism by which
oral Tregs play protective roles in anti-candidal host defense and
immunomodulation, by promoting IL-17A and controlling TNF-
α respectively (Pandiyan et al., 2011a; Carvalho et al., 2012;
Whibley and Gaffen, 2014; Whibley et al., 2014; Bhaskaran
et al., 2015a,b). We have also shown a mechanism of Treg
homeostasis during OPC infection (Bhaskaran et al., 2016).
Here we determined whether bacterial SCFA control fungal
infection and immunopathology, by increasing the abundance
and function of Tregs in vivo. Our results demonstrate that
SCFA produced by commensal microbiota play an important
role in combating oral mucosal Candida infection. While
SCFA mediated an incomplete protective effect in antibiotic
treated mice, the partial protective effect required an optimal
induction and/or maintenance of Tregs and Th7 responses in oral
mucosa.

Resident Microbiome Promotes Mucosal Host-Resistance
Reagents and Antibodies
Purified α-CD3 (145-2C11), purified α-CD28 (37.51), α-IL-4
(11B11), and α-IFN-γ (XMG1.2) antibodies, ELISA and flow
cytometric Foxp3, IL-17A, IFN-γ, and IL-17A antibodies
were purchased from Affymetrix/Thermo Fisher Scientific.
Recombinant IL-6, IL-1β, IL-12, IL-4, and IL-7 were purchased
from (BioBasic Inc., Amherst, NY, United States). Recombinant
mouse IL-23 and human TGF-β1 were purchased from R&D
systems or Affymetrix/Thermo Fisher Scientific. Mouse cells were
cultured in complete RPMI-1640 (Hyclone) supplemented with
10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM
glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 50 µM
β-mercaptoethanol.
Antibiotics (Abx) and SCFA Treatment
in vivo
We used age (4 weeks), and gender matched specific pathogen
free mice for the experiments. We used both male and female
mice for all the experiments. For the depletion of SCFA producing
anaerobic resident bacteria we used the antibiotic regimen and
time-line that were reported previously (Arpaia et al., 2013;
Furusawa et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013). We administered a
cocktail of ampicillin; 500 mg/L, vancomycin; 500 mg/L and
metronidazole; 1 g/L in the drinking water and monitored the
fluid intake regularly. We continued the pretreatment with Abx
for about 4 weeks before the mice were orally infected with CA.
To examine the effect of SCFA, some mice received a mixture
of sodium propionate and sodium butyrate (Millipore-Sigma;
50 mM each) in drinking water. This concentration has been
previously shown to deplete anaerobic bacteria in the gut
(Arpaia et al., 2013; Furusawa et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013).
According to these studies, the amounts of SCFA provided in
the drinking water were in the range of 35–
150 mM, where they
observed significant effects on Tregs. Moreover, SCFAs are found
at concentrations ranging from 50 to 100 mM in the colonic
lumen (Cummings et al., 1987). In the oral cavity, human salivary
concentrations of concentrations of SCFA are 0.5–
5 mM (Das
et al., 2015). Thus we rationalized to use these concentrations in
drinking water in our studies. As SCFAs were given as sodium
salts, pH matched sodium water was given to control mice.
As additional controls, some mice were administered with Abx
but were not infected. Some were given immunosuppressive
cortisone in some experiments (data not shown).
OPC Infection in Mice
Age and gender matched C57BL/6 and FDTR transgenic mice
were infected as previously described (Kamai et al., 2001; Conti
et al., 2009; Pandiyan et al., 2011a). Briefly, they were infected
under anesthesia with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine, by placing
a cotton ball saturated with 2 × 107 C. albicans (CA) (SC-5314)
blastospores sublingually for 90 min. In some experiments, they
were immunosuppressed with 225 mg/kg cortisone acetate. To
model recurrent infection, we infected with CA, and on day 7
after initial infection we performed re-infection. PBS inoculated
mice were used as uninfected sham control as described
previously (Conti et al., 2009). For experiments involving FDTR
transgenic mice that express diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor
in Tregs, we intraperitoneally injected DT (20 µg/10 gm body
weight) on days −6, −3, −1, 0, 3, and 6 of infection. We
monitored the weight regularly after infection until euthanasia.
Cell Purification
Splenocytes and lymphnodes were harvested from 5 to 8 weeks
old mice. CD4+ naïve cells were purified using Easysep
naïve CD4 isolation kits purchased from Stemcell technologies
(Vancouver, BC, Canada).
Th Differentiation in vitro
For Th17 polarizing condition, we stimulated CD4+ CD44low
CD62Lhigh CD25− naïve cells using 1 µg/ml soluble α-CD3
and 2 µg/ml soluble α-CD28, 25 ng/ml IL-6, 2 ng/ml TGF-β,
6 µg/ml α-IFN-γ, and 6 µg/ml α-IL-4 antibodies in the presence
of T cell depleted antigen presenting splenocyte cells (APC).
For iTreg polarizing condition we stimulated the naïve cells
using 1 µg/ml soluble α-CD3 and 2 µg/ml soluble α-CD28 with
20 ng/ml IL-2, 4 ng/ml TGF-β in the presence of APC. Naïve cells
were magnetically sorted from spleen (SPLN) and lymphnodes
(LN) using Stemcell Technologies naïve cell sorting kits. When
indicated, cells from whole SPLN and LN, or indicated mucosal
tissues were used for stimulation under Th17 or iTreg polarizing
conditions as above. When indicated, we added fresh stocks of
SCFA (Sigma-Aldrich) namely, sodium acetate (10 mM), sodium
propionate (P) (1 mM) and sodium butyrate (B) (0.1 mM)
at the same time as stimulation. As acetate did not show
consistent effects in our preliminary experiments, we focused
only on propionate and butyrate in subsequent experiments.
We determined the above concentrations based on titrations in
T cell cultures and concentrations used in previous literature.
We kept the concentration ranges close to physiological SCFA
concentrations in human saliva (Yu et al., 2014). We found that
propionate and butyrate, when used at concentrations higher
than above, completely blocked the proliferation and activation of
T cells. pH matched sodium salt were used as untreated control.
Histology and Intracellular Staining of
Cytokines
For immunocytochemical Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) staining,
tissues were washed with PBS, fixed with 10% formalin overnight
and suspended in 70% ethanol to prevent hyperfixation. Paraffin
sectioning and staining of paraffin sections were performed by
Histoserv, Inc., Germantown, MD, United States. For single-cell
staining, cells were isolated from mice, washed in PBS, fixed with
Fix-Perm kit (eBiosciences/Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, United States). Before fixation, the cells were stimulated
with PMA (50 ng/ml) and ionomycin (500 ng/ml) for 4 h, with
brefeldin-A (10 µg/ml) added in last 2 h.
Flow Cytometry
All data were acquired using BD FACS Fortessa cytometer and
were analyzed using FlowJo 9.6 software.

RESULTS
Abx Mediated Depletion of Resident
Bacteria Reduces Resistance to Oral
Candida albicans Infection, and SCFA
Administration Partially Restores
Protective Host Defense
Abx have been shown to reduce SCFA producing commensal
anaerobic bacteria previously (Arpaia et al., 2013; Furusawa et al.,
2013; Smith et al., 2013). Therefore, we hypothesized that Abx
mediated reduction of SCFA levels will increase fungal infectivity
and immunopathology during OPC. To that end, we depleted
SCFA producing anaerobic resident bacteria using the similar
method and time-line reported previously (Arpaia et al., 2013;
Furusawa et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2013). We administered
a cocktail of antibiotics (Abx), namely ampicillin; 500 mg/L,
vancomycin; 500 mg/L and metronidazole; 1 g/L) in drinking
water from weaning (∼4 weeks of age) and monitored the fluid
intake regularly. We continued the pretreatment with Abx for
about 4 weeks before the mice were orally infected (Figure 1A).
We found that the combination of Abx we used significantly
diminished salivary SCFA levels in oral mucosa (Supplementary
Figure S1A). To examine the effect of SCFA, some mice received
a mixture of sodium propionate and sodium butyrate (50 mM
each) in drinking water (Arpaia et al., 2013; Furusawa et al.,
2013; Smith et al., 2013). As SCFAs were given as sodium salts,
pH matched sodium water was given to control mice. To model
recurrent infection, we infected with CA, and on day 7 after
initial infection we performed re-infection. PBS inoculated mice
were used as uninfected sham control as described previously
(Conti et al., 2009). As additional controls, some mice were
administered with Abx but were not infected. To determine
SCFA effects on Candida (CA) growth, we plated CA in vitro
with different SCFA, and administered SCFA as above in OPC
mice, and found that SCFA did not control CA growth directly
in vitro and in vivo (Supplementary Figure S1B). As positive
controls for infection, some mice were given immunosuppressive
cortisone, which succumbed to severe fungal infection and
weight loss and had to be euthanized after primary infection
(Supplementary Figures S1B, S2). We monitored the weight
regularly until day 28 or 29 after infection, at which point
the mice were euthanized. We observed that administration
of Abx rendered mice significantly more susceptible to weight
loss during primary infection and reinfection (Figure 1B). Mice
treated with Abx + SCFA completely regained their weight
during primary infection. Also during reinfection, this group
of mice partially but significantly recovered from weight loss
compared to mice that were treated with Abx alone. As expected,
uninfected mice with and without Abx did not lose weight, but
rather gained weight (data not shown, Figure 1B). On day 28
or 29 after secondary infection, we re-infected the mice and
isolated the tongue, and determined the fungal burden using
tongue lysates, as well as PAS staining and histo-pathological
examination of intact tongue tissues 3 days later. We found
that the mice receiving Abx showed higher fungal burden
in lysates, and revealed fungal hyphae (Figures 1C,D). Mice
that received Abx and SCFA showed significantly lower levels
of fungal hyphae, comparable to infected mice that received
only water. Control uninfected mice, as well as infected mice
that received no Abx, showed no fungus in their tongues
(Figures 1C,D). These data show that Abx caused excessive
tissue pathology, and SCFA promotes fungal clearance and
inflammation resolution during recurrent OPC infection in Abx
treated mice.
Abx Mediated Depletion of Resident
Bacteria Reduces IL-17A Production and
Treg Frequencies During OPC Infection,
and Administration of SCFA Partially
Restores Th17 and Treg Cells
Because of the known host-protective functions of Treg and
Th17 cells (Pandiyan et al., 2011a; Carvalho et al., 2012;
Whibley and Gaffen, 2014; Whibley et al., 2014; Bhaskaran
et al., 2015a,b), we then determined the expression of IL-17A
and Foxp3 in CD4 T cells recovered from these mice. On
day 28 or 29 after infection, we re-infected the mice, and a
day later isolated the mouse oral intra-epithelial and lamina
propria leukocytes (MOIL) of tongue and draining cervical
lymph nodes (CLN), evaluated the frequency of Th17 cells and
Tregs using flow cytometry and ELISA, after a short in vitro
restimulation. Quantification of IL-17 cytokine levels in CD4
cells from infected mice revealed that Abx significantly decreased
frequency of IL-17A producers among CD4 cells compared
to mice that did not receive Abx (Figure 2A, 2nd and 3rd
panels). Also, Abx caused a significant reduction in IFN-γ
producers (Figure 2A). SCFA increased the frequency of IL-17A
producers, but not the IFN-γ producers, implying that SCFA
specifically promotes IL-17A production in T cells in the context
of OPC (Figure 2A, 4th panel, Supplementary Figure S3).
ELISA quantification corroborated these intracellular cytokine
staining data and also confirmed that CA mediated IL-17A
responses and Abx mediated effects on IL-17A were restricted
to oral mucosa and draining lymph nodes and not observed in
spleen (Figure 2B). Evaluation of CD4+Foxp3+ cell frequencies
revealed that CA infection induces an increase in Foxp3+ cell
frequencies and cell numbers in MOIL and CLN, and that Abx
prevented the Treg induction (Supplementary Figure S4, 2nd
and 3rd panels, Figure 2C). Furthermore, we observed that Abx
also reduced the frequency of preexisting Foxp3+ cells in MOIL.
Importantly, SCFA administration significantly and completely
restored the Foxp3+ cell frequencies to levels of mice without
Abx treatment (Supplementary Figure S4, 4th panel, Figure 2C).
These data show that while Abx depletes Th17 and Treg cells in
oral mucosa, SCFA increases IL-17A production as well as Treg
frequencies in CD4+ T cells during OPC infection in Abx treated
mice.

Abx Treatment Also Results in Gut
Inflammation During OPC Infection in
Mice
SCFA facilitated restoration of Th17 cells and Treg cells and
infection clearance, but did not reverse weight loss. These results
prompted us to examine the gut, as gut inflammation is known
to cause weight loss. On day 28 or 29 after secondary infection,
we re-infected the mice and assessed gut inflammation as well
as the presence of fungal hyphae using histopathological PAS
staining 3 days later. We observed that the colon of the infected
mice treated with Abx had considerable thickening of colon wall,
epithelial cell hyperplasia, elongated crypts compared to infected
mice that received no Abx (Figure 3A). While we did not observe
the presence of fungal hyphae, PAS staining of colon sections
revealed increased glycoproteins including mucin in mice that
received Abx. One day after second re-infection, we isolated colon
to obtain single cell suspensions mouse gut intraepithelial and
lamina propria leukocytes (MGIL). Flow cytometry analyses of
MGIL revealed that Abx recipients contained a clearly increased
population of inflammatory IL-17A- and IFN-γ producing T
cells (Th1∗) compared to the other groups (Figure 3B, 3rd
panel, Figure 3D). However the mean fluorescent intensity
(MFI) of IL-17A expression in IL-17A+ cells was somewhat
much lower than the other groups (Figure 3B, 3rd panel,

MFI of IL-17A cytokine expression and the frequency of
Th17 cells (that produced IL-17A only). While SCFA did not
affect IFN-γ+ producers (Th1 cells) in Abx treated mice, it
significantly decreased the frequency of IL-17A+IFN-γ+ double
producers (Th1∗ cells) in the gut. In contrast to the oral mucosa,
and correlating to gut inflammation, the overall frequency of
IFN-γ producers significantly increased with Abx, while SCFA
administration reduced IFN-γ production in CD4+ T cells in

with the results in oral mucosa, we found that Abx dramatically
reduced the size of Treg population in gut, and was partially but

significantly restored by SCFA (Figures 3C,D). These data show
that Abx mediated depletion of gut resident microflora leads to
reduction of Foxp3+ Treg and Th17 cells, but a concomitant
increase in IFN-γ production in colonic CD4+ T cells in
colon as well gut immunopathology. These effects were only
partially reversed by SCFA. Altogether, SCFA confers only partial
protection to gut inflammation caused by oral CA infection in the
context of resident microbiota depletion.

Next we determined whether SCFA promotes Th17 and Treg
differentiation in vitro in a manner similar to what we observed
in vivo. We first sought to examine the effects on naïve
CD4+ T cells stimulated under Th17 (Figure 4A, upper panel)
and iTreg skewing conditions (Figure 4A, lower panel; Korn
et al., 2009). We assessed the IL-17A production on day 4

after stimulation of naïve CD4 T cells under Th17 polarizing
conditions. We were surprised to find that both propionate
and butyrate did not promote but rather inhibited Th17
differentiation of naïve cells (Figure 4A, upper panel). To test
whether it was time-kinetics differences, we measured IL-17A
at different time-points. Supernatants collected and day 3 and
5, only confirmed the repressive effects of SCFA in Th17
differentiation (Figure 4B, upper panel). However, similar to
in vivo data, both SCFA increased the frequency of Foxp3+
cells (in vitro induced Tregs) when naïve cells stimulated under
iTreg conditions, without inducing IL-17A (Figures 4A,B, lower
panels). For the differentiation of naïve cells in to Th17 cells,
we used T cell depleted spleen as APC. Because SCFA did
not enhance, but rather inhibited Th17 cell differentiation in
CD4+ naïve cells, we hypothesized that SCFA may increase Th17
cells in vivo, only in the presence of certain other APC, or
other activated T cells. Therefore we tested the effects of SCFA
on CD4 T cells in single cell suspension derived from whole
spleen and lymphnodes in vitro. We activated the cells from
whole lymphoid organs under Th17 and iTreg cytokine milieu
as above and determined Foxp3 and IL-17A expression. We
found that SCFA significantly boosted the frequency of Th17
cells and IL-17A levels in supernatants, as determined by flow
cytometry and ELISA, respectively (Figures 4C,D, upper panels).
There were a very few Foxp3+ cells in these Th17-polarized
cultures, but were unchanged with SCFA treatment. However,
the frequency of IL-17Ahigh expressing Foxp3+ (Treg17) cells
increased with SCFA treatment (Figure 4C, upper panel, X-axis).
When cells stimulated under iTreg conditions were examined, we
found that SCFA, especially butyrate induces Foxp3 expression,
although only moderately (Figure 4C, lower panel, X-axis). As
expected, SCFA did not up-regulate IL-17A in iTreg SPLN and
LN cultures (Figure 4D, lower panel). To validate the effects
of SCFA on T cells in oral mucosal tissues that was observed
during OPC infection in vivo, we next stimulated oral mucosal
T cells in the presence of SCFA in vitro. We stimulated MOIL
under polarizing conditions for 4 days and examined Foxp3 and
IL-17A expression as above. As in whole lymphoid organ cell
suspension cultures, we found that SCFA significantly heightened
both the frequency and geometric MFI of IL-17A expression in
CD4+ cells under Th17 polarization conditions (Figures 4E,F,
upper panels, Supplementary Figure S5). Importantly, MOIL
harbored IL-17Ahigh expressing Foxp3+ cell population (Treg17),
whose frequency were further increased in SCFA treated
cultures (Figure 4E, upper panels, Supplementary Figure S5).
Surprisingly, under iTreg polarization conditions, propionate and
butyrate enhanced the frequencies of both FoxP3 and IL-17A
expressing CD4+ T cells, without giving rise to Treg17 cells. The
effects of propionate were only moderate in increasing Foxp3+
cells in iTreg cultures (Figure 4E, lower panels, Supplementary
Figure S5). Supernatants derived from SCFA treated MOIL
showed heightened levels of IL-17A both in Th17 and iTreg
cultures. Acetate did not affect naïve cell differentiation, but
had modest effects in increasing Foxp3+ cells and IL-17A+
cells in whole SPLN/LN and MOIL cultures. Although the
effects were reproducible, they were moderate, when compared
to propionate and butyrate (data not shown). Taken together,
these data demonstrate that while SCFA inhibited Th17 cell
differentiation of naïve cells in the presence of T cell depleted
splenocytes, they promote the induction and or expansion of
IL-17A and Foxp3 expressing CD4 T cells in lymphoid organs
and mucosal tissues. These data show that while SCFA can have
differential effects on IL-17A expression depending on cellular
and cytokine milieu, they increase the frequency of Foxp3+ cells
in all culture conditions tested. While their ability to promote the
induction of Foxp3+ expression in naïve cells cannot be ruled out
in our experiments, it is more likely they expand the pre-existing
Tregs in CD4+ T cell population.
SCFA Did Not Protect Treg Depleted
FDTR Mice From Tongue
Immunopathology During OPC
Because our previous studies showed the requirement of Tregs
for optimal Th17 responses and immunomodulation during
OPC infection (Pandiyan et al., 2011a), we hypothesized that
Abx mediated depletion of Tregs could be a critical factor
causing the adverse effect during OPC infection. Also, the above
results showing SCFA mediated induction/expansion of Tregs
both in vivo infection and in vitro potentially implies that
SCFA mediated protective effects is Treg dependent in vivo. We
decided to explore this possibility more carefully. We devised
a more direct experiment to examine whether SCFA affords
protection from immunopathology during OPC infection in
settings where Tregs are absent during acute primary infection.
To this end, we employed FDTR transgenic mice in which the
DT receptor is expressed in Tregs, where these cells can be
depleted by injecting DT during the course of infection. Because
the long-term depletion of Tregs by DT is lethal and causes
autoimmunity in mice, we did not deplete Tregs in the same
regimen as above, but only the week before primary infection.
One of the DT groups received prior SCFA treatment under the
above-mentioned regimen (starting from day -30 of infection,
Figure 1A), while the other group did not. As controls, we had
FDTR sham group, FDTR infected group without DT, and WT
group receiving DT. As expected, FDTR infected group that
received DT continued to lose weight while infected mice that
received no DT, recovered from weight loss starting from day 3
after infection. Interestingly, SCFA did not protect Treg depleted
FDTR infected group from weight loss (Figure 5A). On day 7
after infection we re-infected the mice with CA and measured
immunopathology and infection susceptibility as assessed by
tongue PAS staining 3 days after re-infection. Both Treg depleted
groups, without and with SCFA treatments showed persistence
of fungus in tongue (Figures 5B,C). However, unexpectedly,
SCFA treated mice had considerably less infiltration of cells,
moderately less tongue immunopathology than mice that did not
receive SCFA (Figure 5C, compare 2nd, 3rd, and 4th panels). DT
treated WT mice did not show fungal burden, demonstrating that
susceptibility to infection was not caused by DT injection, but
rather by possible depletion of Tregs in FDTR infected group. To
confirm Treg depletion in these mice, we measured the frequency
of Foxp3+cells among CD4+ T cells in MOIL and CLN, on day 1
after re-infection. As expected, infected mice showed moderately

increased Foxp3+ Tregs compared to sham controls, showing
that CA infection induces Tregs in the periphery (Bhaskaran
et al., 2015a; Figure 6A, 1st two panels, Figure 6C). DT treated
groups showed significant depletion of Tregs, but their frequencies
were only slightly increased (but not significantly) in mice under
SCFA treatment (Figure 6A, 3rd panel, Figure 6C). WT mice
that received DT injection showed normal levels of Tregs. When
we examined the gut we did not find gross inflammation in
any of the groups (Supplementary Figure S6). This is likely
due to these mice having an intact microbiome combined with
short time span of Treg depletion, compared to those with
long term infection and Abx treatment in previous experiments
(Figures 1, 2). Evaluation of IL-17A and IFN-γ producing CD4+
T cells in MOIL and CLN revealed that Treg depletion caused a
considerable decrease in IL-17A production from 25.4 to 9.3%
consistent to our previous data (Pandiyan et al., 2011a), showing
that Tregs are required for optimal IL-17A production during
mucosal infection (Figure 6B, 2nd and 3rd panels, Figure 6C).
Treg depletion affected neither the frequency of IFN-γ producers
nor the IFN-γ+IL-17A+ double producers (Th1∗) in DT injected
groups. Importantly, SCFA treatment failed to restore the
induction of IL-17A expressing cells during OPC (Figure 6B,
4th panel, Figure 6C). Consistent with these data, we also found
that SCFA administration did not protect Abx treated mice from
weight loss in the absence of Tregs during short-term acute
CA infection (Supplementary Figure S7). Taken together, these
results reveal that SCFA mediate their protective effects by one
or more ways(s) of maintenance, or induction of Tregs and Th17
cells during OPC.
DISCUSSION
Here we studied how SCFA produced by commensal bacteria
control Tregs in the context of OPC pathogenesis. We found
that Abx not only reduced Treg cells, but also the frequency
of IL-17A producers among CD4 T cells both in oral mucosal
tissues and draining CLN. Reduction of Tregs with concomitant
reduction of Th17 cells and an increase in tissue pathology
and fungal burden is consistent with our previous studies that
demonstrated oral Tregs play protective roles in anti-candidal
host defense and immunomodulation (Pandiyan et al., 2011a;

New data presented here demonstrate a surprising protective
effect of SCFA on the resolution of OPC infection. It appears
that resident microbiota derived SCFA provide molecular signals
to induce and, or maintain Treg and Th17 cells that have
known protective roles during OPC infection. Interestingly,
while Abx treatment reduced both IL-17A and IFN-γ in the
oral mucosa, SCFA restored only the expression of IL-17A
and Foxp3, and not IFN-γ, showing specific effects of SCFA
in Th17 cells and Treg cells in the context of OPC infection
and Abx treatment (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3).
In fact in infected mice that did not receive Abx, we found
that SCFA rather inhibited IFN-γ production without having an
adverse outcome (Figure 2A, 5th panel, Supplementary Figure
S3), showing that normal microbiome might have additional
protective effects that are dependent on IFN-γ expression and
independent of SCFA and Tregs in oral mucosa. Mechanistic
details underlying the differential effects of SCFA on IFN-γ in
oral mucosa and gut mucosa remain to be studied. Although
SCFA reversed the pathology caused by Abx, one caveat to our

experiments is the lack of direct evidence that Abx resulted
in SCFA depletion in mice. We also did not clarify whether
there were changes in microbiota in the gut or oral mucosa.
However, we have cautiously made our inference that Abx
must have caused reduction of resident bacteria and SCFA,
based on previous reports that showed SCFA reduction with
Abx regimen (Atarashi et al., 2011; Arpaia et al., 2013; Smith
et al., 2013). Also, whether SCFA are generated by mouse oral
microbiome and if those bacteria were also reduced locally
remains to be seen. However, previous studies in humans that
showed presence of SCFA in saliva and dys-regulated levels of
SCFA in saliva samples of periodontitis patients support the
contribution of SCFA by oral resident microbiota (Yu et al.,
2014).
As we previously reported, we also found that CA infection by
itself increases Treg frequencies (Figure 2C and Supplementary
Figure S4), likely in a TLR-2 dependent manner (Bhaskaran
et al., 2015a). We believe that these are peripheral Tregs that
are induced in local mucosa during infection and likely play
immunomodulatory roles to prevent exacerbated inflammation.
However, the inter-relationship between tTregs and pTregs in
mucosal tissues during an ongoing infection is not clear and
remain to be studied. Data presented here do not allow
us to distinguish between the possible proliferation (and/or
consequent expansion) of IL-17A+, Foxp3+, and Treg17 cells and
the induction of cell differentiation and consequent expression
of these molecules in T cells. Based on absence of naïve
cell differentiation in to IL-17A+ and Treg17 cells in spleen
(Figure 4A), we can make a cautious inference that SCFA
expand pre-existing IL-17A+ cells in mucosa. The role of
microbiome, and SCFA in particular, on epithelial cells and APC
in maintaining or inducing these Tregs, as well as in IL-17A
induction in cells other than Th17 cells during infection will
be investigated in the future. One of the surprising findings of
our study is that Abx in the context of OPC caused excessive
inflammation in the gut that showed features of ulcerative
colitis. Although PAS staining did not show any presence of
visible fungal hyphae in the gut, it revealed excessive mucus
production (Figure 3A; McManus, 1946; Erben et al., 2014).
It is possible that a combination of Abx and OPC infection
resulted in overall gut microbial dysbiosis and excessive mucus
production. These data are consistent with a previous study
that showed an association between inflammatory bowel disease
and resident fungal microbiota dysbiosis in humans (Sokol
et al., 2017). In our current study, the inflammation in the
gut was associated with a significant loss of colon Tregs and
considerable increase in cells that co-produced IL-17A and IFN-γ
(Figure 3B, 3rd panel). These cells, known as Th1∗ cells, are
shown to be associated with inflammatory bowel diseases and
autoimmunity in humans (Zielinski et al., 2012; Sallusto, 2016).
Th1∗ cells that we found in MGIL were IL-17Alow producers
(with low MFI of IL-17 expression), in contrast to IL-17Ahigh
cells that only produced IL-17A (Th17 cells) (Figure 3B).
Increased gut pathology that we observed in Abx treated mice
is not necessarily contributed by increased fungal burden or
persistence of fungal infection in the gut. This was evidenced
by PAS staining that did not show much fungal presence in
the intestine (Figure 3A). We believe that while the initial
oral/fungal infection might have triggered the inflammation
pathology, loss of Foxp3+ cells and concomitant increase in
IFN-γ producers (Th1) and Th1∗ cells mainly contributed to
gut pathology (Figures 3C,D). While SCFA reduced Th1∗ cells,
they only partially suppressed gut inflammation. This was also
associated with a small increase in IL-17Ahigh Th17 cells and
Treg cells. However, SCFA significantly decreased overall IFN-γ
production, especially in gut Th1∗ cells (Figure 3B). Thus it
appears that generation and control of Th1 and Th1∗ cells
in the gut likely depends on gut cytokine milieu, distinct
from that of oral mucosa. While these results portend that
gut and oral mucosa have different mechanisms, our results
did not completely rule out the possibility that gut microbiota
dybiosis caused some of the changes observed in oral mucosa.
Also, it appears that SCFA mediated modulation of IFN-γ
might depend on local cytokine milieu and be independent
of presence of Tregs. Future studies, also examining the IFN-γ
production by ELISA will clarify these findings. During a
short-term acute infection and re-infection in FDTR mice,
loss of Tregs did cause oral immune pathology, but did not
lead to overt colon inflammation (Figure 5), showing that
long-term Abx treatment, combined with depletion of Tregs
and repeated long term CA infections are required for gut
inflammation (Figure 3). Because long-term treatment of Abx
alone in un-infected mice did not by itself result in spontaneous
inflammation in gut (data not shown), it is clear that a pathogenic
infection such as CA infection must be a triggering factor
for colon inflammation in the context of microbial dysbiosis
and SCFA deprivation. Results from our in vitro experiments
(Figure 4), where SCFA demonstrated diametrically opposite
effects on naïve T cells, T cells in whole organ cultures,
and mucosal tissue cells, further validate that SCFA has one
or more mechanisms of regulating T cells depending on the
microenvironment with different cell types and cytokines in
the milieu. These inferences are fully consistent with previous
studies in colon (Arpaia et al., 2013). With regards to Tregs,
it was clear that SCFA consistently induced an increase in
Foxp3+ T cells in all settings, both in vitro and in vivo, and
thus might be the central mechanism by which SCFA mediate
their immunomodulatory effects. Our in vivo experiments using
FDTR mice confirm this tenet (Figure 5). In these mice,
reduced frequency of Foxp3+ Tregs correlated well with the
decreased frequency of IL-17A producers and reduced fungal
clearance. Although SCFA did not protect Treg depleted mice
from weight loss, we found considerably less infiltrating cells
in tongue. Reduced inflammation could have been due to small
increase in Tregs that we observed in these mice (Figure 6A).
We believe that this effect might also have been mediated by
SCFA acting on other cells such as macrophages and dendritic
cells (Singh et al., 2014). Although we did not investigate the
mechanism by which SCFA mediated Treg induction directly,
it was likely dependent on HDAC activity of SCFA that is
known to increase Foxp3 protein acetylation and stability
(Vinolo et al., 2011; Arpaia et al., 2013). The precise details
remain to be seen. Taken together, these results show that
during OPC, one or more interdependent Treg populations have

multiple layers of protective effects, one for IL-17A induction
in CD4 T cells, and another for immunomodulation to prevent
excessive inflammation. By enhancing the Treg numbers and
possibly functions, SCFA derived from resident bacteria play
unequivocal role in promoting protective Th17 cells. Thus our
results have identified previously unknown functions of SCFA
in Th17 mediated anti-microbial resistance in oral mucosa.
Excessive or reduced SCFA may be a sign of commensal dysbiosis
and pre-disposition to pathogenic infections and inflammation in
humans.
