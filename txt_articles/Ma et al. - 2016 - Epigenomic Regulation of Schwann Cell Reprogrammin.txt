The rapid and dynamic transcriptional changes of Schwann cells in response to injury are critical to peripheral nerve repair, yet the
epigenomic reprograming that leads to the induction of injury-activated genes has not been characterized. Polycomb Repressive Com-
plex 2 (PRC2) catalyzes the trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27me3), which produces a transcriptionally repressive chro-
matin environment. We find that many promoters and/or gene bodies of injury-activated genes of mature rat nerves are occupied with
H3K27me3.Incontrast,themajorityofdistalenhancersthatgainH3K27acetylationafterinjuryarenotrepressedbyH3K27methylation
before injury, which is normally observed in developmentally poised enhancers. Injury induces demethylation of H3K27 in many genes,
such as Sonic hedgehog (Shh), which is silenced throughout Schwann cell development before injury. In addition, experiments using a
Schwann cell-specific mouse knock-out of the Eed subunit of PRC2 indicate that demethylation is a rate-limiting step in the activation of
such genes. We also show that some transcription start sites of H3K27me3-repressed injury genes of uninjured nerves are bound with a
mark of active promoters H3K4me3, for example, Shh and Gdnf, and the reduction of H3K27me3 results in increased trimethylation of
H3K4. Our findings identify reversal of polycomb repression as a key step in gene activation after injury.

Introduction
The remarkable plasticity of Schwann cells underlies the exten-
sive regenerative capacity of peripheral nerves (Kim et al., 2013;
Jessen and Mirsky, 2016). After injury, Schwann cells proliferate
and launch the transcriptional signature of immature stages with
concomitant repression of myelin genes (Nagarajan et al., 2002;
Patodia and Raivich, 2012a, 2012b; Kim et al., 2013; Brosius Lutz
and Barres, 2014; Jessen and Mirsky, 2016), so the transition was
historically viewed as dedifferentiation. However, Schwann cells
in injured nerves also activate genes that are never expressed
during embryonic Schwann cell development and are unique to
the injury condition, such as Shh and Olig1 (Arthur-Farraj et al.,
2012; Lin et al., 2015). Such changes allow Schwann cells to pro-
mote axon regeneration and therefore have been termed “repair”
Schwann cells. For example, although dispensable in differentia-
tion, the injury-induced transcriptional factor c-Jun was high-
lighted as a critical regulator of the repair process (Arthur-Farraj
et al., 2012). Nerves with c-Jun-deficient Schwann cells displayed
delayed demyelination, greater neuronal death, reduced macro-
phage migration and myelin clearance, and failure of reinne-
rvation and functional recovery. These observations reflect the

Significance Statement
Peripheral nerve regeneration after injury is dependent upon implementation of a novel genetic program in Schwann cells that
supportsaxonalsurvivalandregeneration.IdentifyingmeanstoenhanceSchwanncellreprogrammingafternerveinjurycouldbe
used to foster effective remyelination in the treatment of demyelinating disorders and in identifying pathways involved in regen-
erative process of myelination. Although recent progress has identified transcriptional determinants of successful reprogram-
ming of the Schwann cell transcriptome after nerve injury, our results have highlighted a novel epigenomic pathway in which
reversal of the Polycomb pathway of repressive histone methylation is required for activation of a significant number of injury-
induced genes.

Ma et al. • Reversing Polycomb Repression After Nerve Injury
 importance of the functional repair Schwann cells in nerve regen-
eration and other studies have shown that aging-associated im-
pairment of peripheral nerve regeneration is due to deficient
Schwann cell responses (Verdu
´ et al., 2000; Kang and Lichtman,
2013; Painter et al., 2014).
Epigenomic regulation is an important aspect of genetic re-
programming in differentiation of diverse cell lineages. The roles
of several epigenomic modulators have been characterized in
Schwann cell differentiation and myelination (Chen et al., 2011;
Jacob et al., 2011; Hung et al., 2012; Weider et al., 2012; Ma et al.,
2015), but the injury-induced epigenomic reprograming that
leads to the activation of genes involved in the nerve repair pro-
gram has not been characterized.
Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) represses target
genes through dimethylation and trimethylation of histone H3
Lys27 (H3K27me2 and H3K27me3; Pasini et al., 2004; Mont-
gomery et al., 2005; Boyer et al., 2006; Ezhkova et al., 2009; Ezh-
kova et al., 2011; Aldiri and Vetter, 2012). The complex consists
of EZH2, with methyltransferase activity, and the nonredundant
core subunits, suppressor of zeste 12 (SUZ12) and embryonic
ectoderm development (EED). H3K27 methylation represses
transcription by recruiting other factors such as PRC1, which in
turn catalyzes ubiquitination of H2A, blocking transcriptional
elongation, and RBP2 demethylase, which reverses the trimethy-
lation of H3 Lys4 (H3K4me3), a modification associated with
active promoters (Vire
´ et al., 2006; Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Stock et
al., 2007; Ku et al., 2008; Pasini et al., 2008; Blackledge et al.,
2015).
As a first step in understanding the role of the polycomb path-
way and H3K27 trimethylation in peripheral nerves, we analyzed
a Schwann-cell-specific deletion of the Eed (Eed cKO) subunit of
the PRC2 complex. Early development of myelin was largely un-
affected, but older mice developed progressive hypermyelination
and morphological changes affecting both myelinated and un-
myelinated nerve fibers of adult nerves (Ma et al., 2015). Inter-
estingly, loss of H3K27me3 caused an induction of a number of
repressed genes and, in particular, 30% of derepressed genes were
a subset of genes that are normally upregulated after peripheral
nerve injury. This included the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene, which
is not normally expressed in Schwann cells, but is activated upon
nerve injury (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015). Because
depletion of H3K27me3 was sufficient for the activation of a
number of injury-induced genes in Schwann cells, removal of
H3K27me3 may be required in conjunction with injury-induced
transcription factors to activate a larger subset of injury response
genes. The results described below indicate how injury genes are
normally repressed before injury and describe the epigenetic
changes that are involved in reprogramming Schwann cells after
nerve injury.
Materials and Methods
Primer sequences and antibodies. The antibodies targeting H3K27me3
(Active Motif, 39155), H3K27ac (Active Motif, 39133), and H3K4me3
(Millipore, 04–745) were used in the study. Primers are listed in Table 1.
Experimental animals and nerve injury surgery. All animal experiments
were performed according to protocols approved by the University
of Wisconsin Graduate School. Eed-floxed mice were generated by
backcrossing the flox allele for seven generations against the C57BL/6
genetic background and mated to mP0TOTA-Cre [B6N.FVB-Tg(Mpz-
cre)26Mes/J; Jackson Laboratory]. Mice were genotyped as described
previously (Feltri et al., 1999; Xie et al., 2014). Samples collected from
mice homozygous for floxed Eed served as control in this study. Sciatic
nerves of adult Sprague Dawley rats or mice were cut by following the
surgery protocol described previously (Hung et al., 2015). As a control,
the contralateral limb also received a sham operation consisting of only a
skin incision. The nerve tissue distal to the transection and contralateral
(sham) nerves were isolated for use in gene expression analysis and ChIP
experiments. Both male and female mice were used individually per sam-
ple at a similar ratio between the floxed Eed and Eed cKO genotypes of
gene expression analysis and ChIP experiments. Male rats were used in
ChIP experiments after nerve injury surgery.
Nerve explant cultures. Adult male Sprague Dawley rat sciatic nerves
were cut into 3 mm segments and cultured in serum-free RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin in the presence of
GSK-J4 (Tocris Bioscience, 4594) or DMSO at 37°C for 1 or 3 d.
qRT-PCR. RNA was isolated from sciatic nerves using RNeasy Lipid
Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s directions. To
prepare cDNA, 250 ng or 1 �g of total RNA of mouse or rat nerves,
respectively, was used from each sample. qRT-PCR and data analysis
were performed as described previously (Hung et al., 2012). Statistical
analyses were evaluated by one-way ANOVA.
In vivo ChIP. Sciatic nerves were subjected to ChIP with anti-
H3K27me3 and anti-H3K27 acetylation antibodies as described previ-
ously (Hung et al., 2015).
Micrococcal nuclease (MNase)-aided in vivo ChIP. Sciatic nerves were
subjected to MNase-ChIP with anti-H3K4me3 antibody as described
previously with minor modifications (Ma et al., 2015). After incubation

 Bioinformatic analysis. K27me3-occupied genes were defined by the
presence of H3K27me3 around the transcriptional start site (�7 Kb)
with a HOMER peak score �10. A previous microarray analysis of em-
bryonic Schwann cell development [neural crest to postnatal day 0 (P0)]
was used to identify expressed genes, which were called present on the
majority of replicate expression arrays for at least one developmental
stage by Buchstaller et al. (2004). We also used neural crest cell (NCC)
RNA-seq analysis by Rada-Iglesias et al. (2012) to identify nonexpressed
gene (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads
[RPKM] �1.5). Nonexpressed genes in both experiments were desig-
nated as the silenced genes in Schwann cell lineage. Genes with RPKM
�1.5 of the NCC RNA-seq analysis were referred to as NCC genes. Genes
with fold reduction �2 of any embryonic time points from embryonic
day 9.5 (E9.5) relative to P0 (Buchstaller et al., 2004) and between P0 and
P56, the time point of myelination at maturity identified by Verdier et al.
(2012), were identified as downregulated genes of embryonic and post-
natal Schwann cells, respectively. Gene ontology analysis was performed
using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID; da Huang et al., 2009a, 2009b).
Results
In our previous study, we found that depletion of H3K27me3 by
a Schwann-cell-specific deletion of a PRC2 component, Eed,
leads to derepression of a group of genes that are normally ex-
pressed after injury (Ma et al., 2015). This suggested that the
removal of this repressive histone modification is a critical step
for the activation of a subset of injury response genes in Schwann
cell repair program. To understand the role of H3K27 trimethy-
lation in gene repression before injury, we first generated a
genome-wide map of H3K27me3 in mature rat sciatic nerve. The
ChIP-seq analysis revealed 2622 H3K27me3-occupied genes of
peripheral nerves that have H3K27me3 peaks within gene bodies
(Shh, Hmga2, Fgf5, and Gdnf) and/or at promoters (Runx2 and
Vgf) (Fig. 1A). Approximately 10% of H3K27me3-associated
genes become induced �2-fold after nerve injury.
Two genes that promote axonal survival and regeneration af-
ter injury are Gdnf and Shh (Oppenheim et al., 1995; Yan et al.,
1995; Boyd and Gordon, 2003; Hashimoto et al., 2008; Fontana et
al., 2012; Martinez et al., 2015). A recent study found that Sonic
hedgehog is not expressed at any stage of Schwann development
before its de novo induction after injury (Lin et al., 2015). There-
fore, we also analyzed the genes associated with H3K27me3 com-
pared with the H3K27me3-map of human NCCs (Rada-Iglesias
et al., 2012) and performed a comparison analysis. Approxi-
mately 30% of peripheral nerve H3K27me3-associated genes are
silenced and occupied with H3K27me3 in NCCs (Rada-Iglesias et
al., 2012). Many of these genes are not detectably expressed in
microarray analysis of embryonic Schwann cell development
(Buchstaller et al., 2004) and some were induced in Eed-deficient
Schwann cells, including Nkx2–2, Olig1, Wif1, and Fgf5 (see Fig.
6B; Ma et al., 2015). The comparison analysis of H3K27me3-map
of peripheral nerves and NCC suggests that the mark was estab-
lished at an early stage of Schwann cell development and repre-
sentative genes of this type are shown in Figure 1B. Gene ontology
analysis was used to characterize H3K27me3-occupied genes
(Fig. 1C). Consistent with previous studies, many homeobox
genes are subject to polycomb silencing (Schwarz et al., 2014).
Another large group of these silenced genes are specifically asso-
ciated with neuron differentiation and another subset (including
Ascl1, Nkx2–2, Olig1, Olig2, and Shh) are also critical regulators of
oligodendrocyte differentiation and gliogenesis (Orentas et al.,
1999; Fogarty et al., 2005; Vallstedt et al., 2005; Fig. 1B,C).
Discovering injury-induced genes such as Sonic hedgehog is
important because these appear to be unique markers of the re-
pair Schwann cell phenotype (Jessen and Mirsky, 2016). If one
assumes that repression by H3K27me3 in neural crest is a feature
of such genes, our results identify a number of other candidate
markers that may uniquely mark the repair Schwann cell pheno-
type in mature nerves. For example, both Gdnf and Fgf5 are
highly induced in Schwann cells after nerve injury. Altogether, we
identify �24 H3K27me3-occupied genes that are silenced in
NCC and then become strongly activated (induction �5-fold) in
Schwann cells after nerve injury, including Olig1, Shh, Gdnf,
Aldh1a2, Rasgrf1, Fgf5, Wif1, Foxq1, and Cplx1 (examples listed in
Fig. 1B). However, it should be noted that, in contrast to micr-
oarray data, Gdnf expression has been detected in embryonic
Schwann cells (Piirsoo et al., 2010).
Using previous microarray analysis of embryonic and postna-
tal Schwann cell development (Buchstaller et al., 2004; Verdier et
al., 2012), we found that �8% of H3K27me3-occupied genes are
expressed in embryonic and/or promyelinating stages, but then
are downregulated before mature myelination (reduction �2-
fold), including genes that were induced in Eed-deficient periph-
eral nerve, such as Igfbp2, Pax3, Hmga2, Tbx2, and Pou3f1/Scip
(see Fig. 6B; Ma et al., 2015). Many of these genes lacked
H3K27me3 in NCCs and therefore likely gain the mark at later
stages of Schwann cell development. This analysis suggests that
the polycomb pathway plays a role in Schwann cell fate determi-
nation by silencing genes of other lineages, particularly neuronal
and oligodendrocyte transcriptional regulators, and in Schwann
cell differentiation by downregulating genes that are expressed in
embryonic and promyelinating stages of development.

 Polycomb-repressed genes can be acti-
vated by H3K27 demethylases (Agger et al.,
2007; Blackledge et al., 2015). We supposed
that injury-activated genes regulated by an
epigenetic on-off switch may have silenced
or a low basal level expression and therefore
likely show a high induction after injury
(�5-fold). H3K27me3-occupied genes
constituted �20% of the more highly in-
duced nerve injury genes (Fig. 2A) and the
gene ontology analysis indicated that
known functions of injury-induced genes
associated with H3K27me3 were particu-
larly associated with the important roles of
Schwann cells in injury responses, such as
secreted/membrane proteins (signal pep-
tides, e.g., Fgf5, Gdnf, and Shh), immune
responses (Tlr2), guiding axons/axonogen-
esis and promoting neuronal development
(e.g., Ngfr and Nrcam) (Fig. 2B). The latter
categories include Shh and Gdnf, which
provide axon guidance cues and promote
axonal regeneration and neuronal survival
after injury (Hashimoto et al., 2008; Schus-
teretal.,2010;Fontanaetal.,2012;Martinez
et al., 2015), representing such repair Schwann cell genes with
H3K27me3 that play critical roles in nerve regeneration.
Defining the repression state of injury-activated genes
We have previously identified injury-induced enhancers by per-
forming ChIP-seq for H3K27acetylation before and after nerve
injury and found that these enhancers were generally enriched
with motifs of injury-induced transcription factors such as c-Jun
and Runx2 (Hung et al., 2015). We supposed that the injury-
induced enhancers may be marked or poised for activation after
injury. Previous studies have characterized developmentally
poised enhancers as those that have open chromatin, histone
H3K4 monomethylation, and binding of histone acetylases CBP/
p300, yet are occupied by the repressive H3K27me3 rather than
H3K27 acetylation (Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011; Rada-Iglesias et al.,
2012; Calo and Wysocka, 2013). In contrast, actively engaged
enhancers are marked by H3K27 acetylation. We therefore tested
the hypothesis that enhancers of injury-induced genes are in the
poised state, which would prepare them for rapid activation upon
injury by switching from trimethylation to acetylation of H3K27.
However, our analysis found that distal enhancers that gain
H3K27 acetylation after injury are almost universally not pre-
marked by H3K27me3 (e.g., Shh; Fig. 3A). Most of the injury-
induced enhancers that gain H3K27 acetylation are distal to the
promoter and the only sites in which injury induced an apparent
local change from H3K27 trimethylation to acetylation were the
promoter regions of a few genes, such as Hmga2, Fgf5, Gdnf, and
Runx2, in which injury-induced sites of H3K27 acetylation
overlap with repressive H3K27me3 before injury. Therefore, the
distal enhancers of injury-activated genes are largely not prepro-
grammed as poised enhancers before injury.
Because H3K27me3 apparently does not repress enhancers
before injury, we examined the distribution of H3K27me3 in
injury-induced genes and the resulting heat map shows that
the repressive histone modification is generally found in the
promoter regions and/or gene bodies (Fig. 3B). Therefore,
H3K27 trimethylation does not appear to be associated with en-
hancers that are induced after injury, but rather proximal pro-
moters and/or gene bodies.
Loss of H3K27 trimethylation after nerve injury
Weperformednerveinjuryexperimentstodeterminewhetherthere
was loss of this repressive histone mark at an early time point (1 d)
after nerve injury. We chose 1 d after nerve injury to minimize con-
tamination from immune cells, which normally infiltrate injured
nerves beginning at 3 d after injury (Perkins and Tracey, 2000; Mu-
elleretal.,2003).ChIP-qPCRanalysisshowedareducedH3K27me3
level in injured nerves compared with sham nerves, suggesting
denervation-induced demethylation of H3K27 (Fig. 4). For several
of these genes, such as Shh, Gdnf, and Fgf5, Schwann-cell-specific
deletion of Eed leading to depletion of H3K27me3 was sufficient to
activate their expression even in the absence of injury (see Fig. 6B).
To determine whether the demethylation is required for gene
activation after injury, we used GSK-J4, which binds the catalytic
pocket and inhibits both H3K27 demethylases, JMJD3 and UTX
(Kruidenier et al., 2012). Unfortunately, this inhibitor has not
been shown to pass the blood–brain or blood–nerve barrier.
Therefore, to deliver the inhibitor effectively and control the en-
vironment of injured nerves, we used a nerve explant protocol in
which some injury responses are activated upon transfer of
nerves to culture (Banner and Patterson, 1994; Mårtensson et al.,
2007; Shin et al., 2013; Blom et al., 2014). In this system, we
observed induction of a number of injury-activated genes, in-
cluding Shh, Igfbp2, Fgf5, and Gdnf, even after 24 h in culture. To
test the importance of H3K27 demethylation, explanted sciatic
nerves were cultured in the presence of either GSK-J4 or DMSO
vehicle. The induction of injury-activated genes by explant
could be inhibited by GSK-J4, as shown by Shh, Fgf5, Gdnf,
Runx2, Hmga2, and others in a 1 or 3 d incubation (Fig. 5). As a
control, another injury-induced gene that is not associated with
H3K27me3, Timp1, was induced �15-fold in explant culture, but
this level was unaffected by GSK-J4 inhibition.
We used ChIP and gene expression analysis of nerves from the
Schwann-cell-specific knock-out of Eed to determine whether
genes are regulated by H3K27me3. Ultrastructural analysis

 showed no apparent developmental ab-
normalities or pathologies that might in-
duce injury response in Eed-deficient
nerves at 2 months (Ma et al., 2015), the
time point of this study. There was a sig-
nificant loss of H3K27me3 at genes in
Eed-deficient nerves compared with con-
trol nerves (Fig. 6A) and many of GSK-J4
affected genes were correlatively dere-
pressed, including Igfbp2, Runx2, Fgf5,
Shh, and Hmga2 (Fig. 6B). This analysis
also expands our previous list of Eed-
regulated genes, which was obtained
through microarray analysis (Ma et al.,
2015), to include other injury-induced
genes such as Runx2, Gdnf, Fgf5, Olig1,
Pou3f1/Scip, and Bdnf. Interestingly, the
promoter of Bdnf, in particular, was re-
cently reported as a PRC2 target in mature
neurons and becomes activated upon
JMJD3-mediated
demethylation
(Pal-
omer et al., 2016).

 Eed cKO peripheral nerves (Ma et al., 2015). This suggested that
the loss of H3K27me3 is sufficient for activation of some genes,
but we wished to determine whether H3K27me3 loss may be
required for a greater proportion of injury-activated genes. This
model would suggest that some injury-activated genes may be
expressed prematurely (or more highly) if H3K27me3 was de-
pleted. Therefore, we investigated how Eed-deficient nerves
primed with the reduced level of H3K27 methylation responded
to the injury in gene activation. Although Esm1 and Vgf were not
derepressed in intact Eed cKO nerves, their levels were dramati-
cally higher in Eed-deficient nerves 1 d after injury, along with
other genes such as Bdnf, Hmga2, Wif1, and Fgf5 (Fig. 6B). No-
tably, Bdnf and Hmga2 become fully induced at 7 and 3 d after
injury, respectively (Barrette et al., 2010; Arthur-Farraj et al.,
2012), but Eed-deficient nerves showed premature induction of
these genes at 1 d after injury. In contrast, Olig1 was modestly
induced in the Eed cKO, but its expression did not increase above
baseline after injury in either control or Eed-deficient nerves.
Based on previous microarray data (Barrette et al., 2010; Arthur-
Farraj et al., 2012), the peak time point of Olig1 induction after
nerve injury is 7 d and our own control data indicate only a
marginal increase at day 1. The inability of Eed loss to increase
Olig1 expression after injury may reflect the requirement of ad-
ditional factors in addition to c-Jun that are absent at this early
time point. However, the premature/higher induction of several
genes in nerves primed with the reduced methylation suggests
that demethylation of H3K27 is required and is a rate-limiting
step in the activation of a larger subset of injury-activated genes
beyond those that we have described previously (Ma et al., 2015),
in which H3K27me3 loss appeared to be necessary and sufficient.
Injury regulation of the H3K4me3 promoter mark
To gain insight into how H3K27 demethylation could activate
genes after nerve injury, we also examined the injury-induced
changes of H3K4me3, which is most often associated with active
promoters (Mikkelsen et al., 2007; van Ingen et al., 2008;
Lauberth et al., 2013). The trimethylation of H3K4 is often in-
versely correlated with trimethylation of H3K27 (Agger et al.,
2007; Issaeva et al., 2007; Pasini et al., 2008). Surprisingly, the
ChIP-seq mapping revealed the presence of H3K4me3 at 54% of
injury-activated genes (�5-fold induction after injury) of unin-
jured nerves (sham condition). The somewhat high percentage of
H3K4me3-bound transcription start sites may be due to basal
expression levels of some genes before injury, such as p75 NTR/
Ngfr (Cosgaya et al., 2002). However, it has been shown that
H3K4me3 is found on poised promoters that are also associated
with H3K27me3 (Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Paige et al., 2012).
Consistent with this possibility, the mapping also displayed
both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 at promoters of 7% of injury-
activated genes that are silenced in NCC and throughout
Schwann cell development, including Shh, Fgf5, Gdnf, Olig1, and
Wif1 (Fig. 7A). In particular, Shh, Olig1, and Gdnf were reported
to be silenced in mature myelinated nerves and immature
Schwann cells (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012; Lin et al., 2015), so the
H3K4me3 signal was less likely from any active promoters. In
contrast to these, the transcription start sites of silenced genes
insensitive to injury, such as Tekt3 and Barhl2, lack H3K4me3.
The map from 1 d after injury showed that the H3K4me3 was
increased and/or broadened to a certain degree at some injury-
activated genes such as Shh, Hmga2, Fgf5, and Gdnf. Overall, our
data indicate that distal enhancers of injury-induced genes are
not poised or “premarked” by characteristics of enhancers
nor are they marked with H3K27me3. However, many injury-
induced genes have promoters that appear to be primed with
H3K4me3 before injury.
Because H3K27me3 recruits RBP2 demethylase, which re-
moves H3K4me3 (Pasini et al., 2008), we investigated whether
demethylation of H3K27 is sufficient to induce trimethylation of

 H3K4 in Schwann cells. ChIP-qPCR analysis identified an in-
crease of H3K4me3 at nearby transcriptional start sites of Eed-
deficient nerves, in which H3K27me3 level is reduced compared
with control nerves (Fig. 7B), and the induction was correlated to
derepression of genes (Fig. 6B). Consistent with the above ChIP-
seq analysis, the analysis showed a significant level of H3K4me3 at
injury-activated genes compared with a silenced gene, Tekt3, in
control nerves. This result would explain our observations that
demethylation of H3K27 after injury leads to the induction of the
H3K4me3 active promoter mark at some injury-activated genes.
Discussion
Studies of Schwann cell responses after nerve injury have dem-
onstrated the extensive reprogramming of the Schwann cell tran-
scriptome (Nagarajan et al., 2002; Bosse et al., 2006; Barrette et
al., 2010; Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012). The observed changes in-
clude repression of the myelin program, but also activation of
several genes that are not normally expressed in Schwann cell
development. Studies of the c-Jun transcription factor and the
Wlds mutant have shown that the rapid reprogramming is vital to
the regenerative response to nerve injury (Arthur-Farraj et al.,
2012). Although it was expected that transcriptional reprogram-
ming would also require epigenomic changes, the specific mech-
anisms have not been characterized. In previous work, an
important clue to one of the mechanisms became apparent when
we found that depletion of H3K27 methylation by a Schwann-
cell-specific knock-out of the Eed subunit of the PRC2 complex
was sufficient to activate several injury genes (Ma et al., 2015).
Profiling of H3K27me3 in mature nerve in vivo revealed that
�20% of injury-activated genes are associated with the repressive
H3K27me3 mark and this includes several well known injury-
induced genes that play a role in nerve regeneration, such as Gdnf,
Bdnf, and Shh (Zhang et al., 2000; Pepinsky et al., 2002; Calcutt et
al., 2003; Song et al., 2006; Hashimoto et al., 2008; Fontana et al.,
2012; Wilhelm et al., 2012; Martinez et al., 2015). The functions
of other genes, such as the Runx transcription factors and Fgf5,
have not been characterized, although they are strongly induced
after nerve injury (Scarlato et al., 2001; Barrette et al., 2010; Hung
et al., 2015).
Although c-Jun is required for full activation of several genes
after nerve injury, many of these genes are partially induced by
injury even in the absence of c-Jun (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012). In
addition, c-Jun is required for full induction of �100 genes after
nerve injury, indicating that other mechanisms are involved in
the reprogramming of Schwann cells. To understand the mech-
anism of Schwann cell reprogramming after injury, it is impor-
tant to identify the mechanisms by which many injury-inducible
genes are repressed or silenced before injury. In this effort, we
have been aided by our recent identification of injury-inducible
enhancers that were identified through analysis of an active en-
hancer mark, H3K27ac, in injured nerve (Hung et al., 2015).
Previous studies had indicated that many enhancers in stem cell
development are at least temporarily in a “poised” state in which
there is open chromatin and association with an active enhancer
mark (H3K4me1), along with repressive H3K27me3 (Rada-
Iglesias et al., 2011; Rada-Iglesias et al., 2012; Calo and Wysocka,
2013). Therefore, we had anticipated that enhancers of injury-
induced genes would follow a similar pattern in which the
H3K27me3 mark in poised enhancers would be replaced with
H3K27ac as the enhancers were activated. Contrary to our ex-
pectations, the ChIP-seq analysis shows that the previously de-
scribed injury-induced enhancers are largely not premarked by
H3K27me3 before injury. Instead, H3K27me3 is generally found
in the promoters and around transcription start sites of the
gene body. Therefore, the reversal of polycomb repression
after nerve injury is not generally associated with the forma-
tion or activation of distal enhancers of injury genes, but in-
stead is focused on reversal of H3K27me3 at promoters and/or
gene bodies of injury genes.

 Therefore, our overall model is that full activation of many
injury genes requires reversal of polycomb repression at promot-
ers/gene bodies in concert with binding of injury-induced tran-
scription factors such as c-Jun and Runx2 at distal enhancers. For
example, there are some common downstream genes of c-Jun
and polycomb pathways, such as Shh, Fgf5, Gdnf, and Runx2.
Because injury-induced enhancers are not premarked, this would
suggest that some injury-induced transcription factors act as pi-
oneer factors to open up the chromatin structure at enhancers of
injury-induced genes. Accordingly, a recent study showed that
the AP-1 (Jun/Fos) transcription factor can make chromatin ac-
cessible for other transcription factors (Biddie et al., 2011).
H3K27 methylation was thought to be relatively stable and
therefore a mechanism of long-term transcriptional memory.
However, the identification of the H3K27-specific demethylases
JMJD3 and UTX demonstrated that polycomb repression can be
reversed (Agger et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007). Therefore, poly-
comb repression of many injury genes predicts that demethyl-
ation of H3K27 contributes directly to activation of a significant
number of injury genes. Peripheral nerve injury induces an in-
crease in the protein level of the Jmjd3/Kdm6b H3K27 demeth-
ylase (Gomez-Sanchez et al., 2013). We therefore tested the
requirement of H3K27 demethylation using GSK-J4 treated
nerve explants. The results showed substantial reduction of in-
jury genes that are normally activated in this model. In addition,
we also tested whether H3K27me3 depletion resulted in prema-
ture and/or augmented induction of nerve injury genes. Al-
though loss of H3K27me3 is sufficient for activation of certain
injury genes, our results indicate that it is a rate-limiting step for
other genes because activation of other injury genes was prema-
ture and/or augmented in the Eed cKO. Several genes listed in our
analyses, Igfbp2, Fgf5, Shh, Runx2, and Hmga2, were found to be
deregulated in other cell types with altered expression of PRC2
components or Jmjd3 (Boyer et al., 2006; Ezhkova et al., 2011; He
et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2013; Perrigue et al., 2015), suggesting that
H3K27me3 is a commonly used epigenetic block that needs to be
removed for their activation.
In this study, we have also shown that the reduction of
H3K27me3 leads to the induction of trimethylation of H3K4 at the
promoter that promotes the binding of general transcription initia-
tion factor TFIID (van Ingen et al., 2008; Lauberth et al., 2013) in
peripheralnerves.Thiswastosomeextentanticipatedbecausepoly-
comb repression is associated with the RBP2 demethylase, which
demethylates H3K4me3 (Pasini et al., 2008). There have been a
number of studies describing the bivalent H3K27me3/H3K4me3
state in stem cell analysis (Mikkelsen et al., 2007; Stock et al., 2007;
Ku et al., 2008). This bivalent chromatin signature was thought to
repress promoters while keeping them poised, which then resolves
upon ES cell differentiation into a H3K4me3-dominant state
through H3K27 demethylation (Bernstein et al., 2006; Mikkelsen et
al., 2007; Voigt et al., 2012). We do observe overlap of H3K27me3
andH3K4me3atsomegenes,includingsomewiththesamebivalent
mark in neural crest analysis. Although our in vivo analysis does not
allow us to conclude that a given promoter is associated with both
histone modifications in the same cell, the induction of H3K4me3
and derepression of repair Schwann cell genes such as Shh is caused
by the Schwann-cell-specific deletion of Eed. In addition, the pres-
enceofthebivalentmarkatsomesilencedgenessuchasOlig1,Gdnf,
and Fgf5 in NCCs is consistent with an early establishment of the
mark in Schwann cell development (Rada-Iglesias et al., 2012).
Although we have performed in vivo chromatin analysis to
retain the important axonal signals affecting Schwann cell devel-
opment, a limiting factor of our analysis is that sciatic nerve con-
tains some endothelial and fibroblast nuclei, although the
majority of sciatic nerve nuclei (�75%) are Schwann cells
(Salonen et al., 1988; Joseph et al., 2004). In addition, �50–80%
of Schwann cells are myelinating and the rest are nonmyelinating
Schwann cells (Zorick et al., 1996; Topilko et al., 1997). For those
genes expressed at very low levels in mature nerve, this would
suggest, although not prove, that their expression is repressed in
both Schwann cell types. Nonetheless, the Schwann-cell-specific
deletion of Eed leads us to conclude that removal of polycomb
repression leads to changes in Schwann cell gene expression.
Aging slows myelin clearance and the onset of functional
recovery after injury (Vaughan, 1992) and such delay appears
primarily due to a deteriorating response of transcriptional
mechanisms of Schwann cells rather than those of neurons (Ce-
ballos et al., 1999; Verdu
´ et al., 2000; Kang and Lichtman, 2013;
Painter et al., 2014). Age-dependent epigenetic change can play a
role because it was shown that a decline in the brain remyelina-
tion with aging is an outcome of the progressive loss of HDAC-
mediated repression (Shen et al., 2008). Our analyses showed that
several of injury-activated genes affected by aging, including Fgf5,
Bdnf, Gdnf, and Igfbp2 (Painter et al., 2014), are regulated by
H3K27me3, which implies that there may be age-related impair-
ment in the demethylation dynamics. Interestingly, aging also
causes derepression of some H3K27me3-regulated genes (Shh,
Thy1, Wif1, etc.) in intact nerves and Shh appears to be the
second-highest overexpressed genes in old nerves compared with
young nerves (Verdier et al., 2012). It is therefore worth investi-
gating the alterations brought by aging in H3K27me3 landscape
of uninjured nerves and demethylation after injury.
The dramatic plasticity of Schwann cell lineage can be ob-
served also in the enteric and parasympathetic nervous systems
where Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) adopt a neuronal fate and
lose the Schwann cell marker SOX10 (Dyachuk et al., 2014;
Espinosa-Medina et al., 2014; Uesaka et al., 2015). Enteric SCPs,
in particular, contribute to 20% of myenteric and submucosal
neurons in the large intestine such that SCP-derived neurogen-
esis is required for the postnatal maintenance of the neuron pop-
ulation of the enteric nervous system (ENS; Uesaka et al., 2015).
In addition, enteric glia retain neurogenic potential and are able
to become enteric neurons in response to ENS injury (Laranjeira
et al., 2011). The observation that neuron differentiation genes
are highly enriched among silenced genes throughout Schwann
cell development, with H3K27me3 found in both NCCs and pe-
ripheral nerves or H3K27me3-occupied injury-activated genes,
raises an intriguing possibility: that demethylation of H3K27
takes a place during the parasympathetic nervous system and
ENS neurogenesis derived from SCPs or enteric glia after injury.
Importantly, Nkx2–2, Olig1, Olig2, Shh, Isl1, Pax3, and Pax6 are
among the critical regulators of neuron differentiation and are
silenced by H3K27me3, as we have demonstrated using Eed-
deficient peripheral nerves.
Our study illustrates H3K27me3 dynamics and regulation of
injury-activated genes. Because patients with peripheral nerve
injury often face a long rehabilitation period, the findings are of
clinical importance and may lead to the identification of tools for
sustainable expression of the repair genes that effectively facilitate
the process.
