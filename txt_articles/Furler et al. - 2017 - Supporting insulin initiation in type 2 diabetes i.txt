ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To compare the effectiveness of a novel model of care 
(“Stepping Up”) with usual primary care in normalising 
insulin initiation for type 2 diabetes, leading to 
improved glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.
Design
Cluster randomised controlled trial.
setting
Primary care practices in Victoria, Australia, with a 
practice nurse and at least one consenting eligible 
patient (HbA1c ≥7.5% with maximal oral treatment).
PartiCiPants
266 patients with type 2 diabetes and 74 practices 
(mean cluster size 4 (range 1-8) patients), followed up 
for 12 months.
interventiOn
The Stepping Up model of care intervention involved 
theory based change in practice systems and 
reorientation of the roles of health professionals in the 
primary care diabetes team. The core components 
were an enhanced role for the practice nurse in leading 
insulin initiation and mentoring by a registered nurse 
with diabetes educator credentials.
Main OutCOMe Measures
The primary endpoint was change in HbA1c. Secondary 
endpoints included the proportion of participants who 
transitioned to insulin, proportion who achieved target 
HbA1c, and a change in depressive symptoms (patient 
health questionnaire, PHQ-9), diabetes specific 
distress (problem areas in diabetes scale, PAID), and 
generic health status (assessment of quality of life 
instrument, AQoL-8D).
results
HbA1c improved in both arms, with a clinically 
significant between arm difference (mean difference 
−0.6%, 95% confidence interval −0.9% to −0.3%), 
favouring the intervention. At 12 months, in 
intervention practices, 105/151 (70%) of participants 
had started insulin, compared with 25/115 (22%) in 
control practices (odds ratio 8.3, 95% confidence 
interval 4.5 to 15.4, P<0.001). Target HbA1c (≤7% 
(53 mmol/mol)) was achieved by 54 (36%) 
intervention participants and 22 (19%) control 
participants (odds ratio 2.2, 1.2 to 4.3, P=0.02). 
Depressive symptoms did not worsen at 12 months 
(PHQ-9: −1.1 (3.5) v −0.1 (2.9), P=0.05). A statistically 
significant difference was found between arms in 
the mean change in mental health (AQoL mental 
component summary: 0.04 (SD 0.16) v −0.002 (0.13), 
mean difference 0.04 (95% confidence interval 
0.002 to 0.08), P=0.04), favouring the intervention, 
but no significant difference in physical health 
(AQoL physical component summary: 0.03 (0.15) v 
0.02 (0.13)) nor diabetes specific distress (5.6 (15.5) 
v −2.4 (15.4)). No severe hypoglycaemia events were 
reported.
COnClusiOns
The Stepping Up model of care was associated with 
increased insulin initiation rates in primary care, and 
improvements in glycated haemoglobin without 
worsening emotional wellbeing.

Introduction
Nearly 600 million people worldwide will have type 2 
diabetes by 2030.1  Innovation in delivering effective 
clinical care to these people is therefore an urgent 
global priority. To reduce the risk of long term macro-
vascular and microvascular complications,2  UK, Euro-
pean, and US guidelines recommend early adoption of 
insulin as part of stepwise treatment intensification to 
bring glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) below a general 
target of 7% (53 mmol/mol).3-6  Insulin initiation is often 
delayed, however, particularly in primary care,7  where

Achieving and maintaining glycaemic targets early in type 2 diabetes improves long

There are barriers to early stepwise progressive treatment intensification to achieve 
glycaemic targets in primary care, particularly when starting insulin
Interventions have had limited success in overcoming the delay in starting insulin 
treatment and changing clinical practice, in part because system level barriers are 
not addressed

Our model of care intervention changed clinical practice, with more patients in 
intervention arm practices starting insulin, with an overall benefit in terms of HbA1c 
reduction, achieved without serious adverse events or any worsening in depressive 
symptoms
The theoretical base and flexible implementation are important characteristics of 
our intervention
Our model of care used existing resources and thus has important implications for 
policymakers, funders, and practitioners seeking innovative ways to provide the 
best care for people with type 2 diabetes in primary care

implementation is not widespread despite being recom-
mended as part of routine clinical management of type 
2 diabetes.6  The mean HbA1c of people with type 2 dia-
betes before starting insulin is typically 1.5-2.0% above 
target: 9.3% (78 mmol/mol) in the UK,8  8.6% (70 mmol/
mol) in a study in the US,9  8.9% (74 mmol/mol) in a 
large, multicountry primary care study,10  and 9.4% (79 
mmol/mol) in a community study in Australia (after a 
median diabetes duration of 8.1 years).11
Delay in treatment intensification by healthcare pro-
fessionals, despite evidence that intensification is war-
ranted and effective,12  is a major barrier to initiating 
insulin in people with type 2 diabetes.13  The delay can 
be due to health professional factors14  (for example, 
concerns about hypoglycaemia risk, lack of confidence 
or skills in insulin initiation or titration), health system 
factors15  (competing priorities in busy, reactive primary 
care settings), and patient related factors (psychologi-
cal resistance to insulin inititation16). Supporting and 
embedding insulin initiation in routine primary care 
practice is an important first step in potentially reduc-
ing referrals to costly secondary care, and in supporting 
timely, early optimisation of treatment, to better 
achieve glycaemic targets.
Our trial investigated the effectiveness of a new 
model of care: the Stepping Up model, which was 
designed to support insulin initiation in primary care 
among people with type 2 diabetes for whom it is clini-
cally indicated. The Stepping Up model of care is built 
around an enhanced, reconfigured role for primary care 
practice nurses,17  who represent a rapidly growing sec-
tion of the workforce and have a substantial role in the 
management of chronic conditions. Our approach was 
to train and mentor nurses to enhance their knowledge, 
skills, and confidence in discussing and implementing 
insulin initiation within the practice as a part of routine 
care. Furthermore, we aimed to set simple clinical pro-
tocols on insulin initiation. To implement these 
behaviour changes in professionals, we drew on nor-
malisation process theory18  and the results of pilot 
studies.17 
19  Our aim was to address clinician and system 
level barriers to timely insulin initiation, and to nor-
malise insulin initiation as part of standard primary 
care practice. We hypothesised that HbA1c would 
improve among participants in intervention arm prac-
tices, facilitated through timely insulin initiation, com-
pared with the control arm. Furthermore, based on 
previous research,20 21 we expected no major negative 
effect on participants’ general emotional wellbeing 
(depressive symptoms).
Methods
study design and participants
The study design and protocol have been described pre-
viously.22  In summary, we conducted a 12 month, two 
arm, non-blinded cluster randomised controlled trial, 
consistent with CONSORT guidelines,23 to investigate 
the effectiveness of the Stepping Up model of care com-
pared with usual care.
General practices in Victoria, Australia, were eligible 
if they had at least one consenting general practitioner 
and practice nurse and could identify at least one eligi-
ble patient participant: adults with type 2 diabetes with 
above target HbA1c (≥7
.5% (58 mmol/mol)) in the past 
six months who were already prescribed maximum oral 
treatment (at least two oral hypoglycaemia agents at 
maximum doses) or if their GP judged that insulin 
would be clinically appropriate. Patients were ineligible 
if they were aged more than 80 years, were already 
using insulin, had an estimated glomerular filtration 
rate <30 mL/min/1.73m2, were unable to give informed 
consent, or had a complex debilitating medical condi-
tion, such as severe mental illness, end stage cancer, or 
unstable cardiovascular disease.
Our original protocol was based on 58 practices and 
an average cluster size of 5. From our early recruitment 
experience and what was an achievable sample size, we 
subsequently revised this to 74 practices and an average 
cluster size of 3 (appendix files).
randomisation
The unit of randomisation was the primary care prac-
tice. The study statistician computer generated strati-
fied block randomisation sequences with varying block 
sizes (4, 6, and 8) before recruitment. Practices were 
stratified by size (≤2 versus >2 full time equivalent GPs), 
setting (private practice versus community health cen-
tre), and participation (or not) in type 2 diabetes quality 
improvement programmes (the Australian Primary Care 
Collaborative). After providing consent and recruiting 
at least one eligible patient, practices were randomised 
to intervention or usual care. We used this index case 
method24  in all practices because our previous experi-
ence suggested that delaying randomisation of a cluster 
until all patients had been recruited risked loss of 
engagement of GPs.25 The research team then assisted 
practices to continue to identify and recruit patient par-
ticipants (through searching the practice medical 
record database). This meant that allocation conceal-
ment after the index case was recruited was not possi-
ble for the GP and practice nurse. To minimise potential 
bias, participating patients were not informed of their 
study allocation until after they had provided consent. 
Blinding of GP, practice nurse, and patient was also not 
possible given the pragmatic nature of the intervention.
intervention
The Stepping Up model of care, described elsewhere,17 
22 
involved a reorientation of existing resources. Firstly, it 
included an enhanced role for the practice nurse in 
leading the discussion with patients about intensifying 
treatment through insulin initiation and titration. Sec-
ondly, the model of care set simple clinical protocols for 
insulin initiation and up-titration. Thirdly, the model of 
care reoriented the role of the specialist registered 
nurse with diabetes educator credentials in mentoring 
the practice nurse, rather than providing direct patient 
care. Intervention practices had an in-practice briefing 
and training session of 60-90 minutes for GPs and prac-
tice nurses, after which patients with confirmed eligibil-
ity and completed baseline data were invited to consult 
their GP for an assessment to discuss treatment

intensification and referral to the practice nurse. Prac-
tice nurses did not prescribe insulin or manage insulin 
dosing without liaison with the GP, based on the legal 
scope of practice for generalist practice nurses in Aus-
tralia.
Our model of care involved the acknowledgment and 
discussion with patients of the advantages and disad-
vantages of starting insulin treatment, including weight 
gain. We modelled shared decision making as a part of 
the intervention training, drawing on the principles of 
motivational interviewing. This set the scene for 
encouraging practitioners in intervention practices to 
approach participating patients with equipoise in rela-
tion to starting insulin. The intervention was necessar-
ily brief in this pragmatic trial; however, we included in 
it guidance and checklists for GPs and practice nurses 
to discuss the pros and cons of insulin treatment and to 
elicit patient concerns and expectations, while also 
openly acknowledging and accepting that some 
patients may choose not to start insulin.
The role of the registered nurse with diabetes educa-
tor credentials in supporting and mentoring the prac-
tice nurse, and of the practice nurse in leading the 
discussion and implementation of insulin treatment 
with the patient in liaison with the GP, is outlined else-
where.15 20  Titration protocols were based on fasting 
blood glucose levels and use of a three day, 7 point 
blood glucose profile26 to identify the meal with the 
greatest postprandial excursion (see appendix files). 
We gave no additional instructions, so the GP had clini-
cal autonomy regarding the management of oral hypo-
glycaemia agents. Practice nurses and GPs were 
encouraged to see patients as often as thought to be 
clinically appropriate over a period of up to 12 months, 
drawing as needed on the study registered nurse with 
diabetes educator credentials for mentoring and sup-
port, even if the patient remained undecided about, or 
had decided against, starting insulin. Further details 
about the intervention can be found in the referenced 
papers and appendices (see appendix files).
We gave control arm practices a copy of the Austra-
lian type 2 diabetes management guidelines27 and 
offered them training in the Stepping Up model of care 
after the 12 month follow-up of patient participants was 
complete.
Patient involvement
We sought feedback from participants after conducting 
an intervention pilot study15 and used this feedback to 
refine the model of care. We sought further participant 
feedback in a pilot of the data collection forms. 
Throughout the main trial we communicated with 
patient participants through a regular newsletter that 
included aggregate data about study progress and 
opportunities to provide feedback to the study team. We 
assessed the burden of the intervention on patients 
through interviews conducted at the end of the trial, as 
part of process evaluation (to be reported elsewhere). 
This evaluation was led by the Chronic Illness Alliance, 
a consumer advocacy organisation that has been a long 
term collaborator of our research group. We have 
thanked all participants for their involvement in the 
trial, and will provide, at a later date, a final summary 
report of the trial outcomes. Participants have access to 
the study website where all published results will be 
publicly available.
endpoints and data collection
Our intervention targeted a process of care (insulin ini-
tiation); however, we chose a clinically meaningful dis-
ease outcome at an individual patient level as a primary 
endpoint: change (from baseline to 12 months) in 
HbA1c, measured as a continuous variable. We regis-
tered our primary outcome as an absolute HbA1c reduc-
tion of 0.5% in the intervention group compared with 
the control group. Measurement of HbA1c was per-
formed at pathology laboratories aligned with the Dia-
betes Control and Complications Trial and the result 
was communicated to clinicians and patients as part of 
usual clinical care. Researchers retrieved these data 
from medical records or directly from pathology labora-
tories. Secondary endpoints included the proportion of 
participants who transitioned to insulin (this was 
amended from the original protocol where rate of insu-
lin initiation was used, which proved impractical given 
the small cluster size in the study), the proportion who 
achieved a target HbA1c of ≤7
.0% (53 mmol/mol) at 12 
months, and change (from baseline to 12 months) in 
depressive symptoms (nine item patient health ques-
tionnaire, PHQ-9),28  diabetes specific distress (problem 
areas in diabetes scale, PAID),29  and generic health sta-
tus (assessment of quality of life instrument, 
AQoL-8D).30 The Appendix files show differences 
between the registered outcomes reported here and 
those registered in the trial registry, and justification 
and explanation for any changes made. We also col-
lected data on healthcare utilisation and costs, to be 
reported elsewhere.
All participants were provided with a blood glucose 
meter (Performa Nano; Roche Diagnostics) and 
instructed on its use. Subsidised low cost blood glucose 
testing strips were available through the National Dia-
betes Service Scheme.31 Data were uploaded from the 
meter at six and 12 months to a secure server.
statistical analysis
Our statistical analysis plan has been published else-
where.22 In brief, our sample size of 224 patients from 74 
general practices (averaging three patients per practice) 
allowed us to detect an absolute 0.5% mean HbA1c dif-
ference at 12 months between control and intervention 
arms with 80% power and standard deviation of 1 using 
a two sided α of 0.05. Data were analysed using Stata 13 
(StataCorp, TX, USA). Descriptive statistics were used to 
summarise GP, practice nurse, and patient characteris-
tics for the two study arms. Parametric data are reported 
as means (standard deviations) and non-parametric 
data as medians (interquartile ranges). Categorical data 
are reported as numbers (percentages). The individual 
patient was the unit of analysis and the analytical 
methods allow for clustering of patients within the 
practices. We compared binary outcomes between the

two study arms with marginal logistic modelling using 
generalised estimating equations with robust standard 
errors and adjustment for baseline measures and clus-
tering. Mixed effects linear regression was used to 
determine predictors for continuous outcomes, adjust-
ing for baseline measures and clustering at the practice 
level. A t test for proportions was used to compare the 
use of non-insulin agents between arms at 12 months, 
and a Wilcoxon ranked sum test was used to compare 
the number of days since insulin was started between 
control and intervention groups. Analyses were con-
ducted on an intention to treat basis. All participants 
gave informed consent before enrolment.
Results
Participating practices and patients
Between October 2012 and January 2014, 93 primary 
care practices expressed interest and identified 521 
potentially eligible patients (fig 1). Subsequently, 19 
practices did not consent any eligible patients, leaving 
74 participating practices for randomisation. Two hun-
dred and 50 five of the potentially eligible patients were 
subsequently found to be ineligible at screening (n=156) 
or did not respond to the invitation letter (n=99). By 
April 2014, the 74 practices had identified and con-
sented 266 eligible participants (73% of potentially eli-
gible patients identified).
Table 1 shows the baseline characteristics of prac-
tices, GPs, practice nurses, and participants with type 2 
diabetes. Of the total sample, 248 (93%) completed the 
12 month follow-up for the primary endpoint. No differ-
ences in baseline characteristics were observed 
between study completers and non-completers, except 
for a higher proportion of women not completing than 
men (11 v 7).
Primary and secondary endpoints
Table 2  shows the primary and secondary endpoints. At 
12 months there was a statistically and clinically signif-
icant difference between study arms in terms of change 
in HbA1c (mean difference: −0.6%, 95% confidence 
interval −0.9% to −0.3%, P<0.001), favouring the inter-
vention. This is consistent with achieving our registered 
primary outcome of an absolute HbA1c reduction of 
0.5% in the intervention group compared with the con-
trol group. The majority of this change in HbA1c seen in 
both arms was achieved by six months (fig 2).
In the intervention arm, 105/151 (70%) patients 
started insulin (102 were using insulin at 12 months), 
whereas in the control arm, 25/115 (22%) started insulin 
(24 were using insulin at 12 months). The median num-
ber of days from baseline assessment to insulin initia-
tion in intervention and control group patients who 
started insulin was 32 (interquartile range 11.5-134.5) 
days and 85 (63-191) days, respectively (statistically sig-
nificant difference: two sample Wilcoxon rank sum test; 
P=0.005). In the intervention arm, 17 (11%) patients had 
started rapid acting insulin at 12 months, compared 
with one patient in the control arm (P<0.001). Further 
data on insulin use in participants are available in the 
appendix files.
Target HbA1c (≤7% (53 mmol/mol)) was achieved by 
54 (36%) intervention participants (32 of whom were 
using insulin at 12 months) and 22 (19%) control partic-
ipants (two of whom had started insulin): odds ratio 2.2 
(95% confidence interval 1.2 to 4.3), P=0.02. Twenty two 
(15%) intervention participants and 20 (17%) control 
participants achieved target HbA1c without starting 
insulin.
At 12 months, depressive symptoms had not worsened 
and there was no statistically significant difference 
between arms in the mean change (patient health ques-
tionnaire-9: −1.1 (SD 3.5) v −0.1 (2.9)). There was a statis-
tically significant difference in mental health (AQoL 
mental component summary: 0.04 (0.16) v −0.002 
(0.13)), favouring the intervention, but no significant dif-
ference in physical health (AQoL physical component 
summary: 0.03 (0.15) v 0.02 (0.13)) or diabetes specific 
distress (PAID: −5.6 (15.5) v −2.4 (15.4)). There was no sta-
tistically significant difference between arms in the pro-
portion of participants experiencing moderate to severe 
depressive symptoms or severe diabetes specific distress 
(table 2), nor was there any difference by insulin initia-
tion (Wilcoxon rank sum test; P=0.98). No significant 
difference was found in PHQ-9, AQoL, or PAID scores 
when comparing participants who started insulin with 
those who did not (data not shown).
At 12 months there was an average weight gain in the 
intervention arm and an average weight loss in the con-
trol group (1.7 (SD 5.2) kg v −1.1 (5.1), mean difference 2.8 
(95% confidence interval 1.5 to 4.0) kg). There were no 
statistically significant differences in blood pressure or 
other biochemical measures between arms at fol-
low-up, with the exception of triglycerides, which 
remained higher in the control group.
At baseline, participants were using a mean of 2.0 (SD 
0.6) classes of non-insulin hypoglycaemic agents, with

no significant difference between arms (t test, P=0.89). 
The majority of patients were prescribed metformin 
(93% across both arms) and sulfonylureas (63% across 
both arms). There was no significant difference in the 
prescription of individual drug classes by study arm. 
The mean number of classes of non-insulin hypoglycae-
mic agents being used at 12 months was higher in the 
control arm compared with the intervention arm (2.3 (SD 
0.1) v 1.9 (0.1); P=0.01). A higher proportion of people in 
the control group used dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors 
than in the intervention group at 12 months (table 3).
Practices in the intervention arm received 183 mento-
ring support visits from the study registered nurse with 
diabetes educator credentials (mean visits per practice 
5.2 (range 1-8)). Thirty two per cent (48/151) of 
 
participants in intervention practices completed at 
least one three day, 7 point structured blood glucose 
monitoring profile over the 12 month study. Practice 
nurses estimated the time they spent on the study (clin-
ical interactions with participating patients and 
research tasks). On a per practice basis, 23 control prac-
tices and 27 intervention practices reported a median of 
1.5 (interquartile range 0-3.6) hours and 18 (9-20.9) 
hours, respectively.
Overall, 58% of people in the control group were 
recruited before practice randomisation compared with 
45% in the intervention group (significant difference 
P=0.033). Sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore 
whether there was any difference at baseline between 
patients who were recruited before and after randomis-
ation of the practices. No statistically significant 
 
differences were found. Mixed effects linear regression

adjusting for clustering at the practice level for each of 
these groups. Treatment effect in terms of the primary 
outcome remained significant in both groups (treatment

assessed before and after randomisation, respectively).
adverse events
No severe hypoglycaemic events (those that would 
require third party assistance for recovery) or other 
adverse events were reported in either study arm.
discussion
Our model of care changed clinical practice, with most 
participants in the intervention arm starting insulin, 
producing a clinically and statistically significant 
improvement in glycaemia among adults with type 2 
diabetes managed in primary care. This was despite a 
higher patient to GP ratio in intervention practices, and 
was achieved safely, with no severe hypoglycaemic 
events, and without deterioration in emotional wellbe-
ing or health status. Our results indicate that, with 
appropriate support and redesign of the practice sys-
tem, insulin initiation can become part of routine dia-
betes management in primary care, obviating the need 
to refer to specialist services with geographical, cost, 
and accessibility barriers.
strengths and limitations of this study
A strength of our study is the robust theoretical and 
empirical base to our intervention. Our pragmatic trial 
of a complex intervention addressed several known 
barriers to overcoming delay in starting insulin treat-
ment. For example, an intentional component of our 
system redesign was reorienting the practice nurse and 
registered nurse with diabetes educator credentials 
roles, allowing additional time to be spent with 
patients, within existing resources. Other strengths 
include the cluster randomised design, minimising the 
risk of contamination, and our excellent rate of partici-
pant retention (93%).
Our study had limitations. Firstly, practices were ran-
domised after the first consenting patient was identi-
fied, raising the possibility of selection bias. However, 
the balance in key patient characteristics between the 
study arms means that any such bias was minimal. Sec-
ondly, while a smaller cluster size is generally prefera-
ble in a cluster randomised trial, the relatively large 
variation in the cluster sizes in our study may make sta-
tistical adjustments for clustering less effective, in par-
ticular when the number of clusters is small. Thirdly, 
our sample may not have been fully representative of 
the broader population of adults with type 2 diabetes 
managed in primary care for whom insulin is clinically 
indicated. Overall, less than 15% of our sample had 
severe diabetes specific distress or moderate to severe 
depressive symptoms, a lower rate than in a recent 
national Australian sample.32  We will explore imple-
mentation fidelity and variation in more detail through 
a qualitative process evaluation in a subsequent paper. 
Finally, our drugs and hypoglycaemia data were derived 
from GP records and subject to the same accuracy 
 
limitations of any routinely collected clinical dataset. 
Hypoglycaemia is typically underestimated33  and is 
likely to be under-reported in routine medical records.34 
In particular, severe hypoglycaemia is serious but rela-
tively rare and may not have been detected in our study, 
given our sample size.
Comparison with other studies
Only two other trials have tested interventions to 
change clinical practice in this way. The AIM@GP trial 
showed no improvement in insulin prescribing rates or 
glycated haemoglobin.35  It provided scheduled and 
ongoing telephone support from a specialist diabetes 
educator and the option to refer patients to an offsite 
community pharmacist for a one hour insulin initiation 
session. Our intervention differed in that it was based 
completely in the familiar environs of patients’ own pri-
mary care practices, built on existing relationships and 
resources (with the practice based practice nurses), and 
provided an immediate pathway for the GP to delegate 
this clinical task. A UK study, using a before and after 
evaluation design, showed improved HbA1c (−1.4%) at 
six months in patients who started insulin,36  similar in 
magnitude to the improvement in our study. That inter-
vention combined education with face to face and tele-
phone support from a registered nurse with diabetes 
educator credentials for GPs and practice nurses and 
involved full day, offsite training for both GPs and prac-
tice nurses. In contrast, our intervention used a brief 
(60-90 minute) onsite training session incorporated

into the daily running of the practice with flexible sup-
port from the registered nurse with diabetes educator 
credentials, as required. Consistent with previous 
research,37 our study participants did not report worse 
psychological outcomes at follow-up, suggesting that 
insulin treatment can be initiated in primary care for 
people with type 2 diabetes without impairing their 
emotional wellbeing. In fact, at 12 months, the reduc-
tion in depressive symptoms in intervention arm partic-
ipants was significantly greater than that in the control 
arm. Insulin initiation (across both arms) did not affect 
depressive symptoms, diabetes specific distress, or 
generic health status at 12 months.
Conclusions and policy and practice implications
Our pragmatic trial findings have important implica-
tions for the organisation of healthcare and for health 
policy. Our model of care is based on an enhanced role 
for a practice nurse and would not be feasible where 
primary care doctors work in solo practice without 
access to a practice nurse. Nevertheless, even in high 
resource settings, where the move to multidisciplinary 
primary healthcare teams is growing—for example, 
through the growth of the Medical Home movement,38 
our study suggests that simply having access to a prac-
tice nurse will not increase the rate of appropriate insu-
lin initiation. To make the best use of resources, primary 
care workforce models need to be developed and imple-
mented to reorient the way specialists (registered nurse 
with diabetes educator credentials and endocrinolo-
gists) offer support to primary care teams that include 
well supported and resourced primary care nurses. 
Changes in the role of registered nurse with diabetes 
educator credentials is occurring in some health sys-
tems,38 and our study provides evidence of the effec-
tiveness and safety of such models of care. Rather than 
waiting for referrals, specialist services need to offer 
proactive, tailored secondary consultation, liaison, and 
mentoring services that are flexible and supportive of 
the needs of primary care practitioners and patients. 
Scaling up the model of care in metropolitan centres 
would require engaging with hospitals and other health 
services in reorienting the role of registered nurse with 
diabetes educator credentials currently employed in 
direct patient care. Investigation of e-health modalities 
(for example, online training, support, and video con-
sultations) could support implementation of this model 
of care in more distant rural or remote settings.
Our trial findings also have implications for clinical 
practice. The issue around personalising glycaemic tar-
gets and treatments is an important and emerging con-
sideration in the care of people with type 2 diabetes. 
When our trial started, there was vigorous debate about 
the need for caution in setting lower targets. In addi-
tion, our exclusion criteria ruled out participants for 
whom a higher target would definitely be considered. 
Collecting reliable data on duration of cardiovascular 
disease, severe hypoglycaemia, and hypoglycaemic 
unawareness did not prove feasible in this setting. We 
therefore decided to use the general target of 7%. 
Debate continues about the advantages and 
 
disadvantages of intensifying treatment for people with 
type 2 diabetes who have the HbA1c levels mandated in 
our study. Our findings suggest that the Stepping Up 
model of care builds clinical capacity within GP and 
practice nurse teams to undertake the work of insulin 
initiation. However, the model of care did not mandate 
a dogmatic approach to such changes in treatment. It is 
worth noting the major change in HbA1c was achieved 
at six months, and that even in intervention practices, 
only 35% of participants with type 2 diabetes achieved 
the general HbA1c target of <7% (53 mmol/mol), sug-
gesting that practitioners and patients were judicious in 
the way they approached progressive treatment intensi-
fication, within the new model of care.
Our clinical protocols and algorithms were focused 
solely on insulin. It is worth noting that NPH (neutral 
protamine hagedorn) insulin remains widely used and 
that the added costs of analogueue insulins where NPH 
can be used without problem is still subject to debate. 
While we did not prespecify weight gain as a secondary 
outcome, this is an adverse effect of insulin treatment 
and we have chosen to report it. While insulin is still 
regarded as an essential treatment option, as the range 
of glycaemic treatments grows, clinical algorithms 
become more complex.5  Future research needs to 
explore the capacity to generate recommendations for 
real time personalised treatment intensification that 
incorporate this increasing complexity,39 to be used as 
part of the practice nurse led model of care. Future 
research could also address the extent to which 
improvements in glycaemic levels are maintained, and 
the extent to which the model of care is sustained in 
routine clinical practice. In particular, research could 
explore use of the model of care to specifically support 
early adoption of insulin treatment to achieve glycae-
mic targets early in people with recently diagnosed type 
2 diabetes.
The global epidemic of type 2 diabetes demands 
innovation in care delivery. Delaying insulin initiation 
when clinically indicated is neither ethical nor effec-
tive. Furthermore, health systems will not cope with 
demand if insulin initiation remains anchored in spe-
cialist centres, nor will they be able to respond to the 
imperative to achieve glycaemic targets early in people 
with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Thus our prag-
matic, translational study has important implications 
across health systems globally for the organisation of 
care for people with type 2 diabetes. Our effective model 
of care has the potential to improve outcomes while 
making better use of scarce healthcare resources.
