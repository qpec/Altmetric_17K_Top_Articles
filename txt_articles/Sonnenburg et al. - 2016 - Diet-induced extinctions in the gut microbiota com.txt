Abstract
The gut is home to trillions of microbes that play a fundamental role in many aspects of human 
biology including immune function and metabolism 1,2. The reduced diversity of the Western 
microbiota compared to populations living traditional lifestyles presents the question of which 
factors have driven microbiota change during modernization. Microbiota accessible carbohydrates 
(MACs) found in dietary fiber, play a key role in shaping this microbial ecosystem, and are 
strikingly reduced in the Western diet relative to more traditional diets 3. Here we show that 
changes in the microbiota of mice consuming a low-MAC diet and harboring a human microbiota 
are largely reversible within a single generation, however over multiple generations a low-MAC 
diet results in a progressive loss of diversity, which is not recoverable upon the reintroduction of 
dietary MACs. To restore the microbiota to its original state requires the administration of missing 
taxa in combination with dietary MAC consumption. Our data illustrate that taxa driven to low 
abundance when dietary MACs are scarce are inefficiently transferred to the next generation and 
are at increased risk of becoming extinct within an isolated population. As more diseases are 
linked to the Western microbiota and the microbiota is targeted therapeutically, microbiota 
reprogramming may need to involve strategies that incorporate dietary MACs as well as taxa not 
currently present in the Western gut.

 The gut microbiota of hunter-gatherers and populations consuming a rural agrarian diet is 
distinct and harbors greater diversity than the microbiota of Westerners 4–9 (Extended Data 
Fig. 1). One possible explanation for the greater microbiota diversity seen in hunter-
gatherers and agrarians is the large quantity of dietary fiber they consume relative to 
Westerners. Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs), which are abundant in dietary 
fiber, serve as the primary source of carbon and energy for the distal gut 
microbiota 3,4,6,10–12. Therefore, we wished to determine whether a diet low in MACs could 
drive loss of taxa within the gut microbiota.
Humanized mice (4 weeks old, n=10) were fed a diet rich in fiber derived from a variety of 
plants (high-MAC) for six weeks and randomly divided into two groups (Extended Data Fig. 
2). One group was switched to a low-MAC diet for seven weeks, after which they were 
returned to the high-MAC diet for four weeks (Figure 1A; Extended Data Table 1). The 
control group was maintained on the high-MAC diet throughout the experiment. At the start 
of the experiment the microbiota composition from both groups of mice was 
indistinguishable (Student’s t-test p=0.2; UniFrac distance; no significant difference in OTU 
frequency observed between groups, Mann-Whitney U test). The diet-switching mice, while 
consuming the low-MAC diet, had an altered composition relative to controls (Student’s t-
test p=10−25; UniFrac distance). Weeks after return to the high-MAC diet, the microbiota of 
the diet-switching mice remained distinct from controls (Student’s t-test p=3×10−8; UniFrac 
distance at 15 weeks) (Figure 1B). To determine whether taxa had been lost over the course 
of the diet perturbation, we focused on a subset of OTUs that met stringent measures of 
prevalence and abundance and could be confidently monitored over the course of the 
experiment (“high-confidence” OTUs, see Methods). We identified 208 high-confidence 
OTUs in the diet-switching group and 213 high-confidence OTUs in the control group 
(Extended Data Table 2). When mice were switched from the high-MAC diet to the low-
MAC diet, we observed that 60% of taxa (124 out of 208) decreased in abundance at least 
two-fold compared with only 11% of the control group (25 out of 213). When these mice 
were returned to a high-MAC diet, 33% (71 out of 208) were two-fold less abundant. The 
control group did not change significantly (10% were two-fold less abundant; 22 out of 213) 
(Figure 1C; Table S1 and S2). These data reveal two divergent qualities of the microbiota. 
First, 58 of the 208 high-confidence OTUs that exhibit diet-induced decline in abundance 
recovered (were no longer at least two-fold less abundant) with the reintroduction of MACs 
illustrating microbiota resilience over short time scales (Table S3). However, secondly, the 
low-MAC diet perturbation induced “scars” on the microbiota.
We hypothesized that diet-induced microbiota diversity loss would be magnified over 
generations. Mice from the previous experiment consuming the low-MAC diet or the high-
MAC diet were used to generate a litter of pups. Pups were weaned onto the respective diets 
of their parents. This breeding strategy was repeated for four generations. For each 
generation, low-MAC diet parents were switched to the high-MAC diet after their pups were 
weaned, to see if taxa that became undetectable while MACs were scarce would bloom in 
the presence of MACs (Figure 2A, Extended Data Fig. 3). At five weeks old, mice 
propagated in the low-MAC diet condition (born to low-MAC diet parents and consuming a 
low-MAC diet) had a lower diversity microbiota than high-MAC fed controls (Student’s t-
test, Shannon Index p=3×10−6, p=8×10−5, p=8×10−6; generations two, three, and four,

 respectively) (Figure 2B, top). Even after mice were switched to the high-MAC diet for 
several weeks, their microbiota diversity did not recover to control levels (Student’s t-test 
p=2×10−6, p=1×10−8, p=1×10−4, generations two, three, and four, respectively at week 15) 
(Figure 2B, bottom). With each generation, the microbiota composition of the diet-switching 
group showed increasing departure from that of controls (Figure 2C). Weaning the diet-
switching lineage directly onto the high-MAC diet did not correct the diversity loss relative 
to controls (Student’s t-test, Shannon Index p=3×10−6) and there was no difference in 
composition between this group and the generation four diet-switching group (Student’s t-
test p=0.9; UniFrac distance; week 13, generation four and week 5, generation five) 
(Extended Data Fig. 4).
Plotting the relative abundance of the high confidence OTUs over time revealed a pattern of 
taxa loss over generations in the diet-switching group (Figure 2D). Specifically, in the diet-
switching group generations one, two, and three exhibited a progressive loss in high-
confidence OTUs while consuming the low-MAC diet (72%; 150 of 208 lost by generation 
four, week 15) (Table S3). In each generation, switching to the high-MAC diet allowed for 
the recovery of a small number of taxa (grey vs. yellow highlighted rows within each 
generation in Figure 2D), but most did not return (141 of 208 were undetectable by 
generation four, week 15) (Table S3). Most of the lost taxa (112 of the 141) were from the 
Bacteroidales order with an additional loss of 26 taxa from the Clostridiales, making the 
Clostridiales the most numerous high confidence taxon present in the fourth generation 
(Extended Data Fig. 5a,b).
To determine whether the carbohydrate degrading capacity of the microbiota had been 
altered over the four generations, we compared imputed glycoside hydrolases (GH) between 
the first and fourth generations of both the diet-switching and control groups after validating 
this method (Table S4)13,14. Although representation of glycoside hydrolase families is not a 
perfect correlate of specificity for polysaccharide degradation (e.g., due to combinatorial 
activity or polyspecificity within a family) loss of representation within GH families 
provides one measure of changes in glycan degrading capacity. Twenty-two GH families 
showed a loss in abundance in the diet-switching group between the initial time point in 
generation one and four weeks after the switch to the high-MAC diet in generation four 
(Bonferroni-corrected Student’s t-test, p<0.05 plus at least a twofold change) (Extended 
Data Fig. 5c) (Table S5). No differences in GH families were observed in the control group. 
An overall loss in GH diversity occurred between generation four diet-switching mice on the 
high-MAC diet relative to generation one mice (Shannon Index of GH subfamilies, 
p=0.0002; Table S6, Extended Data Table 3). No difference in GH subfamilies was observed 
in the control group. These data demonstrate that, in addition to the loss of high-confidence 
OTUs, the diet-switching group sustained a widespread and marked loss in glycoside 
hydrolase repertoire over the four generations. Future experiments will be needed to reveal 
the functional consequences of these observations in terms of fibre degrading capacity.
We next wanted to determine whether low abundance OTUs that bloom when MACs are 
reintroduced are more likely to be lost due to inefficient inter-generational transmission. 
Low abundance taxa (average abundance < 25 reads) in a given generation were less 
efficiently transferred to the next generation (average abundance > 10 reads to be considered

 present, four weeks after high-MAC diet) compared to high abundance taxa (average 
abundance > 25 reads) (hypergeometric distribution p=0.002, p=4×10−15, p=0.01, 
inheritance between generations one and two, two and three, and three and four; 
respectively) (Table S7). The overall diversity and composition did not change between the 
third and fourth generation (Figure 2B, 2C), however, we wondered whether additional loss 
could be obscured due to lack of resolution of OTUs. Therefore, we identified 280 high-
confidence sub-OTUs in the control group and 261 high-confidence sub-OTUs in the diet-
switching group using a cluster-free filtering approach (Table S8)15. A similar decline in the 
number of sub-OTUs with each generation was observed (114 of 261 sub-OTUs were 
undetectable by generation four, week 15) (Extended Data Fig. 6 and Table S8). Most of the 
lost taxa (77 of the 114) were from the Bacteroidales order with an additional loss of 32 taxa 
from the Clostridiales. Between generation three and four, we detected loss of 22 sub-OTUs, 
compared to four using the lower resolution high-confidence OTUs (Table S8).
Since high dietary MACs were insufficient to restore microbiota composition or diversity to 
control levels, we tested whether reintroduction of lost bacteria was required. Fourth 
generation, diet-switching mice were gavaged with fecal contents (fecal microbiota 
transplant group; FMT) from fourth generation high-MAC diet controls. Since the low-MAC 
diet does not support full microbiota diversity (Figure 2D), the fourth generation FMT 
recipients were fed a high-MAC diet for two weeks (Figure 3A). Within ten days, microbiota 
composition and diversity of the FMT group was indistinguishable from fourth generation 
high-MAC diet controls (Student’s t-test p=0.4 UniFrac distance; Student’s t-test p=0.4 
Shannon Index) (Figure 3B, 3C) and 110 taxa were restored (average abundance ≥ 1 
sequencing read; no taxa restored in no FMT controls) (Figure 3D, Table S9). Restored taxa 
were predominantly from the Bacteroidales (99 taxa), which experienced the greatest loss in 
high-confidence OTUs (Extended Data Fig. 7a). Similar results were observed using the 
high-confidence sub-OTUs (Extended Data Fig. 7b, Table S10).
These data demonstrate a diet-induced ratcheting effect in which certain taxa decrease in 
abundance upon reduced MACs and are not effectively transferred to the next generation. 
Notably, the majority of the lost taxa are Bacteroidales, an order that is proficient in 
consumption of dietary fiber 16. Introduction of dietary MACs are insufficient to regain 
“lost” taxa in the absence of their deliberate re-introduction.
Over our history, humans have experienced major dietary changes from gathered to farmed 
foods during the Agricultural Revolution, and more recently to the mass consumption of 
processed foods in the industrialized world. Each dietary shift was likely accompanied by a 
concomitant adjustment in the microbiota. Here we have used a model in which mice have 
been colonized with a human microbiota from a Westerner to determine the effect of fiber 
deprivation over four generations on the gut microbiota. This model does not allow us to 
address microbiota changes that may have occurred as humans shifted from a hunter-
gatherer lifestyle to one from a modern industrialized country. Our data support a model in 
which consuming a modern diet low in fiber contributes to the loss of taxa over generations 
and may be responsible for the lower diversity microbiota observed in the industrialized 
world compared to present-day hunter-gatherers and rural agrarians. The data we present 
also hint that further deterioration of the Western microbiota is possible.

 The gut microbiota regulates numerous facets of human biology suggesting that our human 
genome has been shaped by interactions with these microbes over our co-evolutionary 
history. However, the microbiota can change on a timescale that is much faster than the host 
allowing for the possibility that the microbiota, if pressed by severe selective forces, could 
undergo change so rapidly that it cannot be accommodated by our human biology. While the 
roles of different types of microbiota diversity in host health remain to be defined, it is 
possible that rewilding the modern microbiota with extinct species may be necessary to 
restore evolutionarily important functionality to our gut.
Methods
Meta-analysis of human populations
16S rRNA datasets from Hadza (n=27), Malawian and Venezuelan (n=213) and American 
(n=315) 4,5 were trimmed to match FLX chemistry as previously described (MG-RAST 
Projects 111, 528, 7058) 12. OTUs were picked on the Greengenes 13.8 database with a 97% 
similarity threshold using UCLUST 17. Alpha-diversity and beta-diversity measures were 
calculated using unweighted UniFrac 18 on rarified OTU tables. PCoA coordinates were 
computed using QIIME 1.8 19. Fecal 16S rRNA data was not included from other studies of 
traditional populations because they 1.) did not use the V4 region of the 16S rRNA for 
amplification and were thus not comparable (Papua New Guinea9), 2.) have not made the 
data publicly available (Yanomami7), or 3.) the control Western data was not comparable to 
other studies (Matses8).
Mice
All mouse experiments were performed in accordance with A-PLAC, the Stanford IACUC 
on mixed gender germ-free Swiss Webster mice that were humanized by oral gavage of 
human fecal sample obtained from a healthy anonymous donor (American male living in the 
San Francisco Bay Area, CA, age 42, omnivorous diet) as previously described 20. 
Humanized mice faithfully reconstituted the diversity and phylogenetic make-up of the 
donor (Pearson’s r=0.96; Extended Data Fig. 2). Mice were randomly assigned to two 
groups and were fed either a high MAC diet (LabDiet 5010) or a low MAC diet (Harlan TD.
86489). The high-MAC diet is a plant polysaccharide-rich diet in which the microbiota 
accessible carbohydrates come from a diverse source of plants including: corn, soybean, 
wheat, oats, alfalfa, and beet. The reported neutral detergent fiber content of the high-MAC 
diet is 15% by weight. The low-MAC diet is defined diet in which carbohydrates are from 
sucrose (31% by weight), corn starch (31% by weight), and cellulose (5% by weight). The 
accessibility of cellulose to gut microbiota is known to be extremely low and we have been 
unable to isolate bacteria from the microbiota that utilize this substrate20. Mice from the 
fecal transplant experiment were from the fourth generation of mice from the diet-switching 
group. Fecal transplants were carried out by gavage using freshly collected fecal samples 
from fourth generation control mice consuming a high MAC diet using a procedure identical 
to the original humanization 21. Fecal samples were collected throughout all mouse 
experiments and stored at −80°C.

 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and analysis
16S rRNA amplicons were generated for the v4 region from fecal pellets collected and the 
16,878,145 Illumina generated sequencing reads were analyzed using Qiime 1.8 as 
described previously 19. Sequencing data underwent quality filtering as described previously 
and data was rarefied to the lowest number of reads observed in a single sample (28,596 
reads) 22. OTUs were identified by open-reference picking using the UCLUST algorithm 
and taxonomy was assigned using the Greengenes 13.8 database. Plots of UniFrac distances 
are from unweighted analyses and UniFrac distance values are reported as within group 
versus between groups. Microbiota diversity was measured by Shannon Index, which takes 
into account both overall richness and evenness. High confidence OTUs were identified 
using the following criteria: present in at least three mice at the start of the experiment (four 
weeks after humanization) and had a collective abundance of greater than 25 reads. High-
confidence sub-OTUs were selected by first filtering out duplicate sequences whose 
distribution across samples is highly correlated. These duplicates correspond to the same 
bacterial populations, either as uncommonly frequent errors or as multiple 16S copies within 
the same bacterium. Second, for each experimental group all sequences whose initial raw 
abundance was at least 5 reads in at least 3 out of 5 mice in that isolator were selected as 
high-confidence sub-OTUs. Sub-OTU level analysis was performed as described 
previously 15.
Glycoside Hydrolase Profiles
This method was validated using samples for which 16S rRNA profiles and metagenomic 
data were available (imputed GH profiles explained 84% of the annotated metagenomic data 
using a simple linear fit without any model corrections; p=10−28)5. Glycoside hydrolase 
(GH) imputations were performed by annotating 2,746 reference genomes with GH families 
using validated hidden Markov models many of which were derived from Conserved 
Domain Database models that are capable of identifying multiple domains within a putative 
enzyme with increased sensitivity23,24. The GHs from taxonomically-assigned communities 
were then calculated by applying a weighted average of the lowest taxonomic level with 
representative genomes. To account for the fact that many GH families have wide ranging 
functions while each GH subfamily may possess distinct function, we further clustered the 
annotated GHs into subfamilies as previously described23,25,26. Fold-changes of ymes 
database (CAZy) in 2013. Nucleic Acids Res. 42, 490ration four mice to the the mean

Generation 1. Humanized mice were fed a high-MAC diet for four weeks then switched to a 
low-MAC diet. One week after diet switch, the mice were bred to generate a litter of pups. 
After three additional weeks on the low-MAC diet, generation two pups were born and 
remained in the cage with their mother for three weeks (generation 1 still consuming the 
low-MAC diet). After pups were weaned, generation 1 mice were returned to the high-MAC 
diet for six weeks. Generation 2. Pups were weaned from their mother at three weeks old 
onto a low-MAC diet, which they consumed for 10 weeks. Breeding pairs for generation 2 
mice were set-up at 7 weeks old. After three additional weeks on the low-MAC diet, 
generation 3 pups were born and remained in the cage with their mother for three weeks 
(generation 2 still consuming the low-MAC diet). After pups were weaned, generation 2 
mice were returned to the high-MAC diet for six weeks. Generations 3 and 4 followed the

 Figure 1. Taxa reduction observed in low-MAC diet is largely reversible in a single generation
a, Schematic of mouse experiment. Humanized mice (n=10) were maintained on a high-
MAC diet for four weeks after which half of the mice were switched to a low-MAC diet for 
7 weeks. These mice were then switched back to the high-MAC diet for >4 weeks. b, 
Principle coordinate analysis of the UniFrac distance for 16S rRNA amplicon profiles from 
fecal samples collected from the diet switching mice (yellow, n=5) and control high-MAC 
diet mice (green, n=5). c, Distribution of OTUs fold changes for diet switching (blue, n=5) 
or control (red, n=5) groups comparing baseline (4 weeks post-humanization) versus week 9 
(5 weeks post-low MAC diet for “diet switch” group; top panel) and baseline versus week 
15 (4 weeks after return to high-MAC diet for “diet switch” group, bottom panel).

 Figure 2. Inefficient inter-generational transfer of taxa driven to low abundance by low dietary 
MACs
a, Schematic of multigeneration mouse experiment. Second (n=6), third (n=6), and fourth 
generation mice (n=6) were weaned onto a low-MAC diet. After mice generated a litter of 
pups that were weaned, low-MAC diet mice were switched to the high-MAC diet for 4 
weeks. A parallel group of control mice were maintained on the high-MAC diet throughout 
(generation 2, n=6; generation 3, n=6; generation 4, n=5). b, Microbiota diversity as 
measured by Shannon index observed in the microbiota of mice at five weeks old (top panel, 
n=6 for each group) or four weeks after shift to high-MAC diet (bottom panel, n=6 for each 
group) from three generations of diet switching mice (grey) or control high-MAC diet mice 
(black). Error bars are shown as s.e.m and P values are from two-tailed Student’s t-test. c, 
Principal coordinate analysis of UniFrac distance for 16S rRNA amplicon profiles from 
fecal samples collected from first generation mice from the control group consuming a high-
MAC diet (green, n=5) or the diet switching group from generation 1 (yellow, n=5), 2 (blue, 
n=6), 3 (red, n=6), and 4 (purple, n=6). d, Heat map of abundance of high-confidence OTUs 
(number of sequencing reads, columns) from the diet switching group (top panel) and 
controls (bottom panel); taxonomic assignment is indicated at the top of each column 
(Bacteroidetes, green; Firmicutes, orange; other, grey). Each row represents an individual 
mouse microbiota from four weeks post-humanization (initial), while consuming the low-
MAC diet (week 9, lo, shaded yellow), and four weeks after switching to the high-MAC diet 
(week 15, hi, shaded grey). Corresponding time points from controls are similarly shaded.

 Figure 3. Reintroduction of lost taxa and a high-MAC diet restores microbiota diversity and 
composition
a, Schematic of fecal transplant mouse experiment. b, Principal coordinate analysis of 
UniFrac distance for 16S rRNA amplicon profiles from fecal samples collected from fourth 
generation control mice on a high-MAC diet (green, n=6), fourth generation, diet-switching 
mice that received a fecal transplant (red, n=3), or did not (blue, n=3). c, Microbiota 
diversity as measured by Shannon index observed in the microbiota of mice that received a 
fecal transplant (red, n=3) or did not (blue, n=3). A green circle denotes the number of 
OTUs observed in fourth generation control mice consuming a high-MAC diet (n=6). Error 
bars are shown as s.e.m. d, Heat map of abundance of high-confidence OTUs (number of 
sequencing reads) from fourth generation diet-switching mice (n=3) three to 14 days after 
FMT (fecal microbiota transplant) and no FMT controls (n=3); taxonomic assignment is 
indicated at the top of each column (Bacteroidetes, green; Firmicutes, orange; other, grey). 
FMT donor (fourth generation control mice, n=5) and fourth generation diet-switching mice 
(n=5) four weeks after consuming high-MAC diet are also shown.
