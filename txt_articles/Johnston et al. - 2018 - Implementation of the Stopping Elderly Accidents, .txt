Abstract
Background and Objectives: Older adult falls pose a growing burden on the U.S. health care system. The Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention’s Stopping Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) initiative was developed as 
a multifactorial approach to fall prevention that includes screening for fall risk, assessing for modifiable risk factors, and 
prescribing evidence-based interventions to reduce fall risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of a 
STEADI initiative on medically treated falls within a large health care system in Upstate New York. 
Research Design and Methods: This cohort study classified older adults who were screened for fall risk into 3 groups: (a) 
At-risk and no Fall Plan of Care (FPOC), (b) At-risk with a FPOC, and (c) Not-at-risk. Poisson regression examined the 
group’s effect on medically treated falls when controlling for other variables. The sample consisted of 12,346 adults age 65 
or older who had a primary care visit at one of 14 outpatient clinics between September 11, 2012, and October 30, 2015. 
A medically treated fall was defined as a fall-related treat-and-release emergency department visit or hospitalization. 
Results: Older adults at risk for fall with a FPOC were 0.6 times less likely to have a fall-related hospitalization than those 
without a FPOC (p = .041), and their postintervention odds were similar to those who were not at risk. 
Discussion and Implications: This study demonstrated that implementation of STEADI fall risk screening and prevention 
strategies among older adults in the primary care setting can reduce fall-related hospitalizations and may lower associated 
health care expenditures.

Falls among community-dwelling older adults pose a sig-
nificant and growing public health concern globally (Peel, 
2011; Williams et al., 2015) as well as in the United States 
(Verma et al., 2016). Older adults reported 29 million 
falls in 2014 with 7 million of these resulting in injury 
(Bergen, Stevens, & Burns, 2016). In 2016, older adult falls

 resulted in over 29,000 deaths, and 3.2 million emergency 
department (ED) visits, of which 963,000 were hospital-
ized (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 
National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, 2017). 
Between 2007 and 2016, there was a 31% increase in the 
age-adjusted death rate due to falls among older adults 
(Burns & Kakara, 2018). These falls impose an economic 
burden on the U.S. health care system, resulting in approxi-
mately $50 billion in medical costs for 2015 (Florence 
et al., 2018). With the older adult population in the United 
States projected to increase 55% by 2030, an estimated 
49 million falls and 12 million fall injuries are expected to 
occur in that year alone unless the rate of older adult falls is 
reduced (Bergen et al., 2016; Burns, Stevens, & Lee, 2016).
In an analysis of the 2005 U.S. Medicare Current 
Beneficiary Survey, less than half of older adults who 
fell talked to their health care provider about it (Stevens 
et al., 2012). The American Geriatric Society and British 
Geriatrics Society’s (AGS/BGS) Clinical Practice Guideline 
recommends a multifactorial approach to fall prevention 
including having the health care provider ask older adult 
patients about falls; assess for modifiable risk factors such 
as gait, balance, and medications; and prescribe interven-
tions such as strength and balance exercises or medication 
adjustments (Kenny et al., 2011). Despite the availability 
of these clinical guidelines, primary care providers (PCPs) 
often fail to use them; thus, the development of educational 
materials and referral resources has been recommended to 
improve provider fall prevention practices (Jones, Ghosh, 
Horn, Smith, & Vogt, 2011). The CDC National Center 
for Injury Prevention and Control developed the Stopping 
Elderly Accidents, Deaths, and Injuries (STEADI) initia-
tive (www.cdc.gov/STEADI) based on AGS/BGS guidelines, 
health behavior theory, and input from health care provid-
ers; and offers health care providers a conceptual frame-
work for older adult falls prevention (Stevens & Phelan, 
2013).
The STEADI Initiative
The STEADI initiative includes a suite of materials (e.g., 
clinical algorithm, fact sheets, training videos) to help 
health care providers discuss fall risks with older adults and 
incorporate effective fall prevention into their practices. 
STEADI includes these core elements:
1. Screening to identify older adults with an increased falls 
risk.
2. Assessing to identify modifiable risk factors (e.g., medi-
cation review, functional ability test, measuring visual 
acuity, orthostatic blood pressure, podiatry review, and 
home hazard evaluation).
3. Intervening to reduce fall risk using evidence-based 
strategies (e.g., strength and balance program, medica-
tion management, occupational therapy, and corrective 
eyewear).
In 2011, the CDC funded the New York State Department 
of Health (NYSDOH) to implement the STEADI initiative 
in New York State (Stevens, Smith, Parker, Jiang, & Floyd, 
2017). NYSDOH partnered with the Broome County 
Health Department and United Health Services (UHS)—the 
largest health care provider in the county—to implement 
the STEADI initiative into UHS’s outpatient practices by:
1. Integrating the core elements of STEADI into the UHS 
workflow.
2. Modifying the outpatient electronic health record (EHR) 
to prompt health care providers to apply STEADI and 
record associated data.
3. Training health care providers in the use of STEADI.
STEADI was implemented in the first UHS primary care 
practice in September 2012 with rollout to 18 other pri-
mary care practices in 2013 and 2014 (Stevens et al., 2017).
Multifactorial fall prevention interventions, which first 
identify an individual’s fall risk factors and subsequently 
intervene to address those factors, have been associated 
with a 24% reduction in falls (Gillespie et al., 2012). The 
CDC’s STEADI initiative was developed as a multifactorial 
intervention, though to date its effects have not been sys-
tematically examined.
The UHS implementation offered a unique opportu-
nity for outcome evaluation of the STEADI initiative. UHS 
had organizational capacity to retrieve data related to fall 
screening, assessment, and intervention from the outpatient 
EHR as well as medically treated falls from ED and hos-
pital EHRs both pre- and postimplementation. The pur-
pose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the UHS 
Broome County implementation of STEADI on medically 
treated falls with the hypothesis that the implementation of 
STEADI would result in fewer medically treated falls. 
Design and Methods
The RE-AIM Framework
The RE-AIM Framework is a comprehensive model for 
planning and evaluation of health interventions that can 
inform both research and practice (Glasgow, Klesges, 
Dzewaltowski, Bull, & Estabrooks, 2004; Kessler et al., 
2013; Klesges, Estabrooks, Dzewaltowski, Bull, & Glasgow, 
2005). This framework conceptualizes the impact of these 
health interventions as a function of five key dimensions: 
Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and 
Maintenance (Glasgow, Vogt, & Boles, 1999). The RE-AIM 
Framework was used for both process and outcome evalu-
ation of the UHS STEADI initiative. This article reports on 
the outcome evaluation with a focus on effectiveness.
Effectiveness of the UHS STEADI Initiative
For this study, effectiveness was evaluated based on patient 
utilization of hospital services (Schwenk et al., 2012), for 
fall-related events both before and after implementation 
of the STEADI intervention. The two measures of patient

 utilization, available from the inpatient EHR, were fall-
related treated-and-released ED visits and fall-related 
hospitalizations (hereafter referred to as medically treated 
falls). To provide context for our findings, an analysis of 
population trends for the county was conducted.
The UHS STEADI Initiative
The EHR was modified to prompt nurses to annually screen 
patients aged 65 and older (“older adult patients”) by asking 
whether the patient had: (1) two or more falls in the past 
12 months, (2) one fall in the past 12 months with an injury, 
(3) one fall in the past 12 months and gait and balance prob-
lems, (4) any gait or balance problems, and/or (5) presented 
with an acute fall (Stevens et al., 2017). Answers to these five 
questions were recorded in the outpatient EHR and a patient 
with an affirmative response to any question was considered 
to have an increased falls risk. For these patients, the nurse 
was to: (a) conduct a medication review, (b) provide educa-
tional materials, (c) administer the Timed Up and Go (TUG) 
test to identify gait and balance issues, (d) record TUG results 
in the EHR, and (e) place the Fall Prevention Referral Form 
(a triplicate form available in online Supplemental Materials), 
on the computer keyboard for the PCP to complete during 
the patient examination. The Fall Prevention Referral Form 
listed evidence-based fall prevention interventions available 
in Broome County that the PCP might prescribe including 
outpatient physical therapy and fall prevention programs 
available in the community (e.g., Tai Chi).
On the basis of the patient’s screening results, the PCP 
would then perform a medical assessment and develop a 
Fall Plan of Care (FPOC) to address any identified issues. 
The PCP checked the recommended interventions on the 
Fall Prevention Referral Form and checked the box labeled 
“Fall prevention referral completed” in the EHR along 
with documenting the plan of care in the EHR. After the 
visit, the wellness coordinator or an office staff member 
scanned the Fall Prevention Referral Form and added it to 
the patient’s EHR.
In practice, health care providers did not follow every 
step for all patients. For many patients, the TUG test was not 
administered, in part due to challenges with fitting the TUG 
into the clinic workflow and/or provider resistance (Stevens 
et al., 2017). Not all at-risk patients received a FPOC. In this 
article, we take advantage of this variation in implementa-
tion to compare at-risk patients who received a FPOC—that 
is, fall prevention interventions—with those who did not.
UHS STEADI Outcome Evaluation
The outcome evaluation has two analyses. First, we con-
duct bivariate and regression analyses on the UHS EHR 
data to examine the relationship between receiving a FPOC 
and subsequent health outcomes (i.e., ED visits or hospi-
talizations). Second, we examine the overall trends in fall-
related ED visits and hospitalizations for older adults in 
Broome County between 2007 and 2015, including time 
periods both before and after implementation of STEADI.
UHS Medically Treated Falls Outcome Analysis
The sample consisted of 12,346 adults aged 65 or older in 
2015 who had a primary care visit at one of 14 Broome 
County outpatient UHS clinics between September 11, 
2012 (first implementation of STEADI) and October 30, 
2015 (end of the study). The criterion of age 65 or older 
in 2015 was used to capture the universe of older adults 
who would be eligible for screening during the study period. 
Primary care visit data for the sample were obtained from 
the UHS outpatient EHR, which included demographic 
information and STEADI fall risk assessment variables. For 
those patients identified as being at risk for falls, medical 
charts were reviewed for any documentation related to pre-
scribed fall risk intervention and these data were abstracted 
manually. Fall-related ED visits and hospitalizations for the 
sample at either of the two Broome County UHS hospitals 
were obtained from the inpatient EHR for visits between 
January 1, 2009, and October 30, 2015—both pre- and 
post-STEADI implementation. This project received expe-
dited review and approval by the UHS Institutional Review 
Board and the Human Subjects Research Review Committee 
at Binghamton University deferred to this decision.
Variables
Older adults who were asked any of the screening ques-
tions were considered screened (Figure 1). If a patient was 
screened more than once during the study period, the first 
screening was used to determine screening status and the 
date of this visit was used as the screening date for analysis. 
Those who did not have any fall risk screening information 
recorded were considered unscreened and were excluded 
from the outcomes analysis as it was not possible to deter-
mine fall risk for these patients.
Among those who were screened, subjects were consid-
ered at risk if they answered yes to any of the five screening 
questions. Older adults who answered no to all five screen-
ing questions were considered to be not at risk. Older adults 
who did not have any “yes” responses and who answered 
“no” to some but not all screening questions were consid-
ered to have an incomplete screen (undetermined risk) and 
were excluded from the outcome analyses.
The FPOC variable was used to measure the implemen-
tation of strategies to prevent falls. Among those who were 
identified as at risk, they were considered to have a FPOC 
if any of the following items were documented in their 
EHR: (a) physical therapy/fall prevention program referral, 
(b) assistive device prescription, (c) fall risk brochure or a 
home safety checklist provided, or (d) fall risk addressed 
in a narrative note by a nurse or a PCP. Older adults who 
were identified as being at risk for a fall were categorized 
as not having a fall plan of care (no FPOC) if there was no 
documentation of any of the earlier mentioned fall risk pre-
vention strategies in the medical record.

 All outcome analyses were conducted on these three 
groups—Group 1: At-risk and no FPOC, Group 2: At-risk 
with FPOC, and Group 3: Not-at-risk.
The outcome variables were medically treated falls 
defined as a treat-and-release ED visit or hospitalization for a 
fall. Both ED visits and hospitalizations were identified from 
the inpatient EHRs of the two UHS hospitals in Broome 
County based on the criteria that (a) the principal diagno-
sis field in the record was for injury, and (b) the first valid 
external cause of injury was coded E880-E888 (excluding 
E887) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017). 
Fall-related events were categorized as occurring either 
before (pre-) or after (post-) the initial screening. Person-
months were calculated as the number of months between 
the patient’s first screening date and the end of the study, 
and used in multivariate analyses to control for the varying 
postscreening exposures among patients.
The number of ED visits and the number of hospitali-
zations were determined for each patient pre- and post-
STEADI screening.
Analytic Methods
Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using 
SPSS for Windows, version 24 (2016, IBM Corporation). 
Descriptive statistics for demographic variables as well as 
prescreening ED visits and hospitalizations were generated 
including percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by 
group. Bivariate analyses examined relationships between 
demographic and grouping variables. Baseline rates of fall-
related events among groups were compared using one-way 
analysis of variance and post hoc analysis was conducted 
using Dunnett’s T3 as the Levene’s test revealed unequal 
variances. Poisson regression was conducted to examine the 
group’s effect on the number of postscreening fall-related ED 
visits and hospitalizations. Regression analyses controlled 
for sex, age, and exposure in person-months. An alpha level 
of .05 was used for tests of statistical significance.
Broome County Trend Analysis
ED visit and hospitalization data for Broome County older 
adult falls were extracted from the NYSDOH’s Statewide

prevention initiative, 2012–2015. Note: *Older adult defined as patients aged 65 years and older. 1Screening determined by whether or not older adult 
was asked 5 questions about falls history in the past year. 2Older adults who answered yes to one of the 5 questions. 3Older adults who answered no 
to all 5 questions. 4Older adults who did not answer yes to any question but did not answer no to all 5 questions. 5Older adults were considered to 
have a Fall Plan of Care if there was documentation in the electronic health record for: (a) referral to physical therapy or a fall prevention program, (b) 
prescription for an assistive device, (c) fall risk addressed in a narrative note by nurse or primary care provider, or (d) fall risk brochure or home safety 
checklist provided.

 Planning and Research Cooperative System (New York 
State Department of Health, 2016) and analyzed for 35 
full quarters from January 1, 2007, through September 30, 
2015. Falls were determined based on the CDC State Injury 
Indicators Report: Instructions for Preparing 2015 Data 
(Thomas & Johnson, 2017).
Rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for falls were cal-
culated for the total older adult population and by gender 
using quarterly treatment data. As quarterly census data 
were not available for the denominator, the yearly popu-
lation of Broome County for the relevant year was used. 
The rate was multiplied by 100,000 to obtain a rate of ED 
visits and hospitalizations for falls per 100,000 popula-
tion. These rates were regressed by quarter to determine 
the trend. Data were extracted and analyzed using SAS 9.4 
software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
Results
UHS Medically 
Treated Falls Outcomes.
Among the 12,346 older adults with a primary care visit 
during the study period, 89.7% (n = 11,080) were screened 
(Figure 1). Of those screened, 601 older adults had incom-
plete screening data and were excluded from the analyses. 
The excluded adults compared with the screened were 
more often men (47% vs 42%, p < .001), in the young-
est age group (71% vs 57%, p < .001), and of a minority 
race (11% vs 6%, p < .001). The final sample consisted of 
10,479 adults aged 65 or older at the time of screening. 
Within this cohort, 18.3% (n = 2,032) were identified as 
being at risk for a fall and 76.2% (n = 8,447) were not at 
risk. Among older adults with a fall risk, 60.9% (n = 1,237) 
had documentation in the EHR for at least one element of 
a FPOC and 39.1% (n = 1,237) did not have any docu-
mented evidence of a FPOC. The percent of at-risk patients 
who received a FPOC varied by clinic location from 32% 
to 85% (data not shown).
The sample was composed of 4,406 men (42.0%) and 
6,073 women (58.0%) (Table 1). A higher proportion of 
older adults at risk for fall were women (66.7%) compared 
with those not at risk (55.8%). The mean age in 2012 was 
72.7 years (SD = 7.8 years), with 39.1% of the sample 
aged 62–69 years, 38.5% aged 70–79 years, and 22.4% 
aged 80 or older. When compared to those not at risk for 
a fall, a lower proportion were aged 62–69 years (25.1% 
vs 42.5%, p < .001) and a higher percentage were aged 
80 or older (38.2% vs 18.6%, p < .001). The sample was 
predominantly white (94.3%) and there was no significant 
association between race and risk group (Table 1).
Those at risk who received a FPOC and those who did 
not had similar rates of prescreening fall-related ED vis-
its (34.3 [95% CI: 29.0, 39.6] and 34.7 [95% CI: 27.5, 
41.9], respectively) and hospitalizations (51.7 [95% CI: 
38.6, 64.9] and 46.5 [95% CI: 31.1, 62.0], respectively) 
(Table 1). Those not at risk had significantly lower rates of 
prescreening fall-related ED visits (9.5, 95% CI: 8.4, 10.5) 
and hospitalizations (11.4, 95% CI: 9.1, 13.9).
Women were 1.4 times more likely to have a fall-related 
ED visit postscreening compared with men when control-
ling for age in 2012, postscreening months of exposure, 
and risk-treatment group (Table 2). The likelihood of an 
ED visit increased 1.1 times with age for each additional 
year. Older adults who were not at risk for a fall were 0.6 
times as likely to have a fall-related ED visit when com-
pared to those who were at risk for a fall but did not receive 
a FPOC (odds ratio [OR]= 0.6, 95% CI 0.4, 0.7). Those at 
risk for a fall who received a FPOC were not significantly 
more or less likely to have a fall-related ED visit when com-
pared to those at risk for a fall who did not receive a FPOC 
(OR = 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 1.7).
Women were 1.5 times more likely to have a fall-related 
hospitalization postscreening compared with men when 
controlling for other variables (Table 2). Age was signifi-
cantly associated with the likelihood of hospitalization, 
increasing 1.1 times for each additional year. Older adults 
not at risk for a fall were half as likely to have a fall-related 
hospitalization when compared to those who were at risk 
and did not receive a FPOC (OR = 0.5, 95% CI: 0.4, 0.8). 
Those at risk for a fall who received a FPOC were 0.6 times 
(95% CI: 0.3, 1.0) as likely to have a fall-related hospital-
ization when compared to those at risk for a fall who did 
not receive a FPOC (p = .041).
Broome County Trends
Hospitalizations for falls among older adults trended 
downward at a statistically significant rate reduction of 2.5 
admissions per 100,000 residents per quarter (Figure 2). 
When stratified by gender, much of this reduction was due 
to declines in the female fall hospitalization rate, which 
was statistically significant. Although the rate among men 
also trended downward, it was not significant. For ED 
visits, there was a nonsignificant upward trend over time 
of 1.1 cases per 100,000 residents per quarter (Figure 2). 
However, when stratified by gender, men appeared to have 
a statistically significant increase, whereas women did not.
Discussion and Implications
Effectiveness of the UHS STEADI Initiative
Implementation of the STEADI initiative into the out-
patient clinic workflow at UHS was associated with a 
reduced number of fall-related hospitalizations for older 
adults prescribed a FPOC. For this group, the odds of a 
fall-related hospitalization postintervention were similar to 
older adults who were not at risk for a fall and were 40% 
lower than those at risk without a FPOC. Relatively few 
other studies have examined the effects of multifactorial 
falls interventions on fall injuries.
A meta-analysis of multifactorial fall risk interventions 
found that such interventions significantly reduced the rate

 of falls (rate ratio = 0.76 [95% CI: 0.67, 0.86]) but not 
the risk of falling (risk ratio = 0.93 [95% CI: 0.86, 1.02]) 
(Gillespie et al., 2012). A collaborative effort promoting fall 
prevention interventions in Connecticut saw an increase in 
the use of fall prevention visits and a reduction in serious 
fall-related injuries and fall-related use of medical services 
in intervention regions compared to regions with usual 
care (Tinetti et al., 2008). More recently, older adults who 
participated in a multifactorial falls intervention in Finland 
were 26% less likely to experience a fall-induced injury 
compared with the control group (Palvanen et al., 2014).
However, other studies of multifactorial fall prevention 
programs found some beneficial effects in the first year but 
did not find a decrease in the incidence of falls requiring 
medical treatment in the long term (Salminen, Vahlberg, & 
Kivela, 2009). In a study with a 9-month follow-up, there 
was no decrease in the incidence or overall costs of falls 
requiring visits to the ED or admissions to the hospital 
(Landis & Galvin, 2014). These authors, however, noted a 
nonsignificant trend toward fewer hospitalizations for falls 
if the patient was fully assessed, had a plan of care, and 
adhered to it.
In a systematic review and analysis, Sherrington, 
Tiedemann, Fairhall, Close, and Lord (2011) found that 
exercise programs as a single intervention reduced the rate 
of falls among community-dwelling older adults by 21%. 
The recent U.S. Preventive Services Task Force evidence 
review found that multifactorial interventions reduced 
the incidence of falls whereas exercise interventions were 
associated with broader range of fall outcomes including 
fewer older adults experiencing a fall and fewer injurious 
falls(Guirguis-Blake, Michael, Perdue, Coppola, & Bell, 
2018). None of these studies examined the effects of a 
multifactorial intervention based on STEADI.
The UHS implementation of the STEADI initiative was 
the first and largest to date, demonstrating the feasibility of 
implementing a multifactorial intervention across a large 
health care system. The 14 UHS clinics in this study screened 
nearly 90% of older adults or over 11,000 patients at least 
once over a 3-year period, of which about 18% were deter-
mined to be at risk. About 61% of those at risk received docu-
mentation of a FPOC in their medical record. In comparison, 
a pilot of the STEADI initiative in Oregon screened 360 older 
adults or 19% of eligible patients over a 3-month period 
(Casey et al., 2016). Stevens and coworkers (2017) suggest 
factors that contributed to the success of the UHS program 
included a strong clinical champion who led the integration 
of STEADI into the clinical workflow and trained clinical and 
administrative staff to ensure everyone understood how to 
appropriately assess and record STEADI activities.
The 90% screening rate found in this study is high, 
but gaps remain in implementation. About 40% of those 
identified as at risk did not have a FPOC documented in 
their medical record. These results suggest that increasing 
the proportion of at-risk older adults with a FPOC has the 
potential to further reduce falls. However, time constraints 
and competing demands are a recurring challenge in imple-
menting clinical fall prevention efforts (Baker et al., 2005).
The trend regression results suggest that fall prevention 
activities, such as STEADI, Tai Chi, and Stepping On, may 
be associated with a decline in hospitalizations at UHS hos-
pitals in Broome County and that gender may moderate the 
effects of fall programs over time. Significant rate decreases 
are seen in female hospitalizations but not in female ED 
visits whereas no changes are seen in male hospitalization 
rates, and male ED visit rates increased. Men are less likely 
than women to report falling, seek medical care for a fall, 
and discuss falls and fall prevention with a health care pro-
vider (Bergen et al., 2016; Stevens & Sogolow, 2005) so 
health care providers may be less likely to consider fall risk 
in older men. This study found that the unscreened/par-
tially screened group had a higher proportion of men com-
pared with the screened group. In disseminating STEADI 
and other fall prevention activities, special efforts may be 
needed to educate health care providers on the threat of 
falls to older men and to tailor initiatives to include and 
address both genders.
This study has other implications for future dissem-
ination. The STEADI initiative (https://www.cdc.gov/
STEADI/) recommends a screening protocol of 12 ques-
tions to identify older adults at risk of a fall. In this imple-
mentation, five screening questions were integrated into the 
UHS workflow to accommodate the time available in a visit 
for screening (Stevens et al., 2017). This approach effect-
ively identified those most at risk for a fall as evidenced by 
the prescreening rates of medically treated falls for those 
screened at risk compared with those not at risk. In add-
ition, screening alone was not sufficient to prevent a fall. 
Our findings suggest that establishing a FPOC—that is, 
actually implementing strategies to address fall risk fac-
tors—is required to reduce adverse fall outcomes. Notably, 
the STEADI core elements of screening, assessment, and 
intervention were tailored to the UHS outpatient and 
Broome County community settings. Adhering to the three 
core elements while customizing them to the clinical envir-
onment made implementation feasible, while still resulting 
in reduced fall hospitalizations.
Limitations of the Study
This study is subject to several limitations. First, receipt of a 
FPOC was not randomized. If prescribing a FPOC is related 
to other unmeasured fall risk factors, this would result in 
selection bias. However, the demographic characteristics and 
the rate of medically treated injuries that occurred prior to 
screening were similar for those who received a FPOC and 
those who did not—suggesting that the two groups had simi-
lar risks. Furthermore, the percent of at-risk patients who 
received a FPOC varied by clinic (data not shown), suggest-
ing clinic factors may play a bigger part than patient fac-
tors. Second, the FPOC elements were identified based on 
manual review of the medical record and it is possible that

 fall prevention activities were missed, or that FPOC elements 
were recommended but not documented. Third, it was not 
possible to determine whether those who received a FPOC 
followed the recommendations or which elements they fol-
lowed. Fourth, FPOC elements ranged from handing the 
patient a brochure to a physical therapy recommendation 
and ranged widely in their potential impact on falls. Fifth, 
outcome data only included fall-related events within the 
UHS system. If a UHS patient sought medical care for a fall 
outside the UHS system, those medically treated falls would 
not be captured. To mitigate this issue, data were restricted 
to the 14 primary care practices where patients were likely 
to use one of the Broome County UHS hospitals. These 14 
practices represent 76.9% of the UHS older adult patient 
population. Sixth, the Broome County data included older 
adults outside of the UHS study intervention sites and the 
population size is calculated yearly rather than quarterly. 
Finally, the current multifactorial intervention at UHS was 
based on STEADI and included the core elements of screen-
ing, assessing, and prescribing (www.cdc.gov/STEADI); 
however, these elements were tailored to the UHS and 
Broome County setting. There may be setting-specific char-
acteristics that affected the success of this initiative. Health 
care organizations wishing to adopt STEADI will need to 
consider the unique context of this implementation as well 
as the barriers, facilitators, and feasibility of implementing 
the core elements in their settings. This study has demon-
strated, however, that health systems can adapt the core ele-
ments and still achieve measurable improvements in health 
outcomes by screening for fall risk among older adults and 
intervening with older adults who are at risk by prescribing a 
plan of care that addresses underlying risk factors.
Conclusions
Older adult falls pose a large and growing burden on the 
U.S. health care system. This study shows that the STEADI 
conceptual framework for fall prevention can be used to 
identify and address modifiable risk factors in primary care 
settings to reduce the number of older adult fall-related 
hospitalizations. This study included a limited number of 
interventions such as providing fall prevention educational 
materials, prescribing an assistive device, and/or referring 
at-risk older adults to physical therapy or a community falls 
prevention program. Implementing additional evidence-
based falls prevention interventions such as vision checks, 
podiatrist referrals, and medication review and manage-
ment would address additional modifiable risk factors 
and have the potential to reduce fall injuries even further 
(Stevens & Burns, 2015). The UHS STEADI initiative dem-
onstrated that fall risk screening and prevention strategies 
among older adults in the primary care setting can result in 
reduced fall injuries among their patients. Given the aging 
U.S. population, these findings are particularly noteworthy. 
With an average cost of over $30,000 for a fall-related hos-
pitalization (Burns et al., 2016) and the increased burden on 
informal caregivers (Wilkinson et al., 2018), wider imple-
mentation of STEADI in primary care across the United 
States may be able to reduce expensive health care expendi-
tures for fall injuries among older adults.
