SUMMARY
Malignant brain tumors are the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths in children. Primitive neuroec-
todermal tumors of the CNS (CNS-PNETs) are partic-
ularly aggressive embryonal tumors of unknown
cellular origin. Recent genomic studies have classi-
fied CNS-PNETs into molecularly distinct subgroups
that promise to improve diagnosis and treatment;
however, the lack of cell- or animal-based models
for these subgroups prevents testing of rationally de-
signed therapies. Here, we show that a subset of
CNS-PNETs co-express oligoneural precursor cell
(OPC) markers OLIG2 and SOX10 with coincident
activation of the RAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated
protein kinase) pathway. Modeling NRAS activation
in embryonic OPCs generated malignant brain tu-
mors in zebrafish that closely mimic the human oligo-
neural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNET subgroup by histology
and comparative oncogenomics. The zebrafish CNS-
PNET model was used to show that MEK inhibitors
selectively eliminate Olig2+/Sox10+ CNS-PNET tu-
mors in vivo without impacting normal brain develop-
ment. Thus, MEK inhibitors represent a promising
rationally designed therapy for children afflicted
with oligoneural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNETs.
INTRODUCTION
Pediatric tumors of the CNS are the leading cause of cancer-
related deaths in children under 14 years of age. The most com-
mon pediatric brain tumors can be broadly defined as glial-like
(such as astrocytoma) or embryonal-like (such as medulloblas-
toma [MB]) and are thought to arise from glial or multi-potent pro-
genitors, respectively. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors of the
CNS (CNS-PNETs) are embryonal tumors that comprise a com-
plex group of highly malignant pediatric brain tumors with similar
histology but diverse clinical behaviors (Adamski et al., 2014;
Chan et al., 2015). Histologically, CNS-PNETs closely resemble
cerebellar MB, but only comprise �10% of MB cases, and are
often localized in the cerebral hemispheres (Chan et al., 2015).
The lack of robust diagnostic markers combined with the rare
occurrence of CNS-PNETs often leads to misdiagnosis and
treatment with heterogeneous regimens, which likely contributes
to the dismal overall survival of CNS-PNET patients despite
aggressive treatments that include surgery, radiation, and
chemotherapy. Indeed, CNS-PNET patients have a 5-year over-
all survival rate of 20%–40%, in contrast to 60%–65% observed
in high-risk metastatic MB (Chan et al., 2015). Clearly, new treat-
ments are needed to improve survival and morbidity in children
with CNS-PNETs.
Recent comparative genomic analysis has classified CNS-
PNETs into distinct subgroups with unique molecular signatures
and/or genetic aberrations (Picard et al., 2012; Sturm et al.,
2016). These studies promise to improve diagnosis and guide
the use of more selective, subgroup-specific therapies that
both increase patient survival and alleviate long-term cognitive
and physical side effects. However, a current barrier to identi-
fying such treatments is the lack of cell- or animal-based models
of CNS-PNET subgroups to test potential therapies, which is
likely due to both the rarity of these tumors and the lack of
defined cellular origins and oncogenic drivers for each subgroup.
Here, we present a genetically engineered animal model of the
CNS-PNET subgroup that is defined by the expression of oligo-
neural precursor cell (OPC) genes, such as OLIG2 and SOX10,
previously referred to as oligoneural PNET (Picard et al., 2012)
or CNS_NB-FOXR2 (Sturm et al., 2016). We show that SOX10-
expressing OPCs represent an origin of the oligoneural CNS-
PNET subgroup by activating NRAS/MAPK (mitogen-activated
protein kinase) signaling in these cells. The zebrafish CNS-
PNET-like tumors show conservation of histopathology (small
round neuroblastic cells of primitive neuroectodermal origin)
and hallmarks of the oligoneural CNS-PNET subtype, including

 Sox10 and Olig2 co-expression. Comparative genomic analysis
also revealed remarkable conservation between the molecular
signaling pathways and differentiation states of zebrafish
and human oligoneural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNETs. Finally, we
describe a drug-screening platform using orthotopic embryonic
brain tumor transplantation in immune-competent animals to
rapidly screen drugs that eliminate these highly aggressive tu-
mors without affecting the development of the rest of the animal
and identify MEK inhibitors as a promising therapeutic option for
selectively eliminating OLIG2/SOX10-expressing CNS-PNETs in
children. Thus, the zebrafish brain tumor modeling and drug
treatment approaches outlined here, combined with its well-
established embryology and imaging properties, provide a
powerful and rapid in vivo method of identifying conserved
developmental, cellular, and molecular mechanisms in child-
hood brain cancers, as well as accelerating subgroup-specific
drug discovery through whole-animal-based, small-molecule
screening.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A Subset of Human CNS-PNETs Express OPC Markers
Coincident with Activation of MAPK Signaling
Recent studies identified a subset of CNS-PNETs with elevated
expression of OLIG2 and SOX10 mRNA (Picard et al., 2012;
Sturm et al., 2016), a combination typically restricted to embry-
onic OPCs and oligodendrocytes during brain and CNS develop-
ment (Weider and Wegner, 2016). Consistent with these findings,
analysis of CNS-PNET gene expression datasets (Li et al., 2009)
showed that 8/26 CNS-PNETs co-expressed elevated levels of
SOX10 and OLIG2 mRNA (Figure S1A), a significant correlation
(p < 0.0001) for this class of pediatric brain tumors (Figure S1B).
Analysis of an MB gene expression dataset (Kool et al., 2008)
also showed that a small fraction of MBs co-expressed OLIG2
and SOX10 mRNA (Figure S1C); however, this correlation was
not significant (Figure S1B). To determine whether OLIG2 and
SOX10 proteins are co-expressed in CNS-PNETs and MB, we
performed immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis on four CNS-
PNETs and 52 MB patient samples, which showed co-expres-
sion in one of four CNS-PNETs and 1 of 52 MB samples
(Figure S1D). Together, these findings show that approximately
25%–30% of embryonal CNS-PNET tumors, and some rare
MBs, co-express SOX10 and OLIG2 in cells that maintain the
histological morphology of undifferentiated glial progenitors
such as OPCs.
CNS-PNETs that co-express OLIG2 and SOX10 have signifi-
cantly elevated ERBB3 mRNA levels (Figures S1A and S1E). As
ERBB3 is an upstream activator of RAS GTPases (Hynes and
MacDonald, 2009), we next determined whether the RAS/
MAPK signaling pathway was activated in OLIG2+/SOX10+ dou-
ble-positive tumors. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of
OLIG2/SOX10-expressing CNS-PNET tumors compared to
all other CNS-PNETs revealed a significantly enriched RAS
pathway signature (Figure S1F). Consistent with these findings,
phosphorylated MAPK (pMAPK) levels were elevated in human
CNS-PNET and MB tumor samples co-expressing OLIG2 and
SOX10 (Figure S1D). Elevated pMAPK staining was also
observed in two additional CNS-PNETs and nine MBs (as repre-
sented in Figure S1D). These studies suggest that a subset of
human CNS-PNETs and MBs may be driven by activation of
the MAPK pathway, a finding consistent with previous studies
showing RAS/MAPK pathway activation in MB (Gilbertson
et al., 2006; MacDonald et al., 2001).
Oncogenic and Wild-Type NRAS Expression in OPCs
Induces CNS Tumors in Zebrafish
To functionally test whether CNS-PNETs could originate from
OPCs with RAS/MAPK activation, we generated DNA constructs
that drive human NRAS expression in embryonic OPCs using
an established sox10 promoter (Kirby et al., 2006). NRAS was
either oncogenic with a GTPase-activating mutation [Tg(sox10:
mCherry-NRASQ61R)],
wild-type
(WT)
[Tg(sox10:mCherry-
NRASWT)], or disabled with a GTPase-inactivating mutation
[Tg(sox10:mCherry-NRASS17N] (Figures 1A and 1B). Up to 88%
of CNS-PNETs have p53 pathway dysfunction in sporadic tu-
mors (Eberhart et al., 2005), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients
are predisposed to CNS-PNET formation (Orellana et al., 1998).
As such, the NRAS DNA constructs were injected into embryos
homozygous for the p53M214K loss-of-function mutation (Bergh-
mans et al., 2005) to generate potentially tumor-bearing animals
containing a randomly integrated (chimeric) NRAS transgene
(Figures 1A and 1B). To aid tumor visualization, all animals

 were also homozygous for the mitfaw2 mutation that eliminates
pigment (melanophore) formation (Lister et al., 1999). By 6 weeks
post-fertilization (wpf), mitfaw2; p53M214K; Tg(sox10:mCherry-
NRASQ61R) embryos displayed CNS tumors at a frequency of
�50% (Figure 1C). Surprisingly, we observed CNS tumors at a
similar penetrance in mitfaw2; p53M214K; Tg(sox10:mCherry-
NRASWT) zebrafish (Figure 1C), although tumors induced by acti-
vated NRASQ61R were more aggressive and showed poorer
overall survival (Figure 1D). Importantly, the expression of
GTPase-disabled NRAS [mitfaw2; p53M214K; Tg(sox10:mCherry-
NRASS17N)] did not give rise to tumors (Figure 1C), indicating
that activation of downstream NRAS effectors is still required
for
mitfaw2;
p53M214K;
Tg(sox10:mCherry-NRASWT)-induced
oncogenesis. Loss of p53 function was also a critical component
(Figure 1E). These data suggest that uncontrolled expression of
WT NRAS in embryonic neural stem cell populations may be suf-
ficient to drive tumorigenesis in a subset of human pediatric brain
tumors. Consistent with this notion, examination of NRAS mRNA
levels in published human tumor databases (https://www.
oncomine.org) showed that NRAS mRNA is highly expressed
in a number of embryonal brain tumors when compared to
normal brain: MB (36- to 50-fold), CNS PNET (51-fold), and atyp-
ical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RTs, 250-fold) (Pomeroy et al.,
2002). Thus, our finding that elevated WT NRAS, together with
p53 deficiency, is sufficient for CNS-PNET tumorigenesis may
provide at least one possible explanation for why mutations in
RAS/MAPK pathway components are rarely observed in pediat-
ric brain tumors, despite reports that these tumors exhibit robust
RAS/MAPK pathway activation (Gilbertson et al., 2006; Sturm
et al., 2016). Future sequencing analysis in CNS-PNET patient
samples may identify additional mechanisms for RAS/MAPK
activation in CNS-PNETs (e.g., NF1 loss, SOS gain) and deter-
mine whether mutations in additional p53 pathway components
are associated with RAS/MAPK activation, as predicted by this
model.
Zebrafish Brain Tumor Histology and Location Are
Consistent with Human CNS-PNETs
Pediatric CNS-PNET tumors are primarily diagnosed based on
location, H&E-based cell morphology, and specific IHC markers
(Chan et al., 2015; Louis et al., 2007). Tumors that are composed
of small blue cells and localized in the cerebrum, brain stem, or
spinal cord are likely to be diagnosed as CNS-PNETs, or as
AT/RTs if they lack INI1/SNF5 staining, whereas those localized
in the cerebellum would be primarily diagnosed as MBs (Chan
et al., 2015). Therefore, to determine the extent to which the
NRAS-driven zebrafish brain tumors resemble human pediatric
tumors, we first analyzed zebrafish tumor location and histology.
We focused our analysis on the mitfaw2; p53M214K; Tg(sox10:
mCherry-NRASWT) tumors generated by transient DNA injec-
tions (outlined in Figure 1A and hereinafter referred to as
NRASWT-driven tumors) due to the previously reported finding
that NRAS expression is elevated in embryonal brain tumors
(Pomeroy et al., 2002), whereas NRAS mutational activation is
less common (Gilbertson et al., 2006). We found that NRASWT-
driven tumors arise both in the anterior lobes (primarily the optic
tectum) and in the hindbrain, including the cerebellum and brain
stem (Figure 1F). Thus, the zebrafish tumors arise in locations
consistent with embryonic brain tumors such as CNS-PNETs
(cerebrum and brain stem) and MBs (cerebellum).
As the majority of human CNS-PNETs are located in the cere-
brum, we next performed histological analysis on three zebrafish
tumors arising in the anterior compartments (Figure 2A). H&E
staining showed tightly packed and undifferentiated small, round
blue cells with a high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio, reminiscent
of human CNS-PNETs (Figure 2A). IHC analysis confirmed the
expression of markers commonly used to diagnose human
CNS-PNETs, including nestin, synaptophysin, and focal Gfap
(glial fibrillary acidic protein) staining (Figure 2A). Tumors also
stained positive for Ini1 (Snf5/Smarcb1), which excluded the
possibility that they are AT/RTs (Figure 2A) (Chan et al., 2015).
Thus, based on histology, the NRASWT-driven tumors arising
from the anterior compartments most closely resemble human
CNS-PNETs.
To determine whether the NRASWT-driven CNS-PNET-like tu-
mors display OPC characteristics, we analyzed Olig2 and Sox10
expression and detected strong positive staining (Figure 2A). The
tumors also expressed NRAS (derived from the transgene) and
pMAPK (Figure 2A). To complement our IHC analyses, we also
performed live confocal imaging in zebrafish fluorescent reporter
lines to visualize olig2-positive (GFP+) cells and sox10-driven
mCherry-NRAS within developing tumors (Figure 2B). This anal-
ysis showed that mCherry-NRASWT and GFP were co-ex-
pressed in tumor cells with a rounded cellular morphology
consistent with the primitive neuroblastic appearance detected
by histology, while in adjacent normal brain tissue, GFP was ex-
pressed in oligodendrocytes with typical elongated and dendritic
morphology (Figure 2B).
Genomic Analysis Shows Zebrafish Brain Tumors
Genetically Resemble Human CNS-PNETs
To determine whether the zebrafish CNS-PNET-like tumors
resemble human CNS-PNET tumors at the genetic level, we
compared
gene
expression
signatures
between
zebrafish
NRASWT-driven tumors and human CNS-PNETs. We first per-
formed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on NRASWT-ex-
pressing zebrafish brain tumors derived from the anterior
compartments, as well as normal brain tissue, and identified
differentially expressed gene signatures indicative of signaling
pathway activation by GSEA (Figure 3A). The analysis was pre-
dictive of an embryonic progenitor origin, with significant enrich-
ment for genes expressed in pediatric tumors, embryonic stem
(ES) cells, and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT),
while gene sets for differentiated neurons and synaptic transmis-
sion were negatively enriched (Figure 3A, see the neuronal gene
set). Oncogenic signatures revealed enrichment for genes regu-
lated by the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) pathway (Figure 3A),
which is consistent with the prevalence of pMAPK in the human
CNS-PNETs (Figure S1D). In addition, the zebrafish tumors likely
have a dysfunctional retinoblastoma (Rb) 1 (Rb1) pathway, since
gene sets predictive of Rb1 loss and E2F transcription factor
activation were significantly enriched (Figure 3A), consistent
with the occurrence of CNS-PNETs in some Rb patients (Li
et al., 2005) and loss of Rb causing embryonal-like brain tumors
in mouse and zebrafish (Jacques et al., 2010; Saab et al., 2009;
Solin et al., 2015).

Cell Reports 17, 1255–1264, October 25, 2016
 Human CNS-PNETs have recently been stratified based on
gene expression analysis, with high levels of both OLIG2 and
SOX10 associated with the oligoneural (Picard et al., 2012) or
CNS_NB-FOXR2 (Sturm et al., 2016) subgroups (Figure S2A).
To determine whether the zebrafish CNS-PNET-like tumors
resemble these specific subtypes, we performed comparative
genomic analysis between human and zebrafish tumors (Fig-
ure 3B; Table S1). We first identified the top 60 up- or downregu-
lated genes in OLIG2/SOX10 co-expressing human tumors
compared to normal human brain (Li et al., 2009) and compared
this list to the differentially expressed genes in zebrafish CNS-
PNET-like tumors compared to normal zebrafish brain (see
Experimental Procedures). This analysis showed that zebrafish
CNS-PNET-like tumors share a highly conserved gene expres-
sion signature with the human oligoneural CNS-PNET subtype
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, when we compared the zebrafish
CNS-PNET-like tumors to all human CNS-PNET brain tumor
subgroups using principal-component analysis (PCA) with pub-
lished gene lists (Picard et al., 2012; Sturm et al., 2016), we found
that the zebrafish tumors are most similar to the oligoneural and
NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNET subgroups (Figure 3C). We also found
that the zebrafish CNS-PNET-like tumors are more similar to hu-
man oligoneural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNETs than zebrafish normal
brain (Figure 3C). Consistent with the PCA findings, analysis of
the
recently
described
CNS_NB-FOXR2
subgroup
(Sturm
et al., 2016) showed that these tumors also have significant cor-
relation with elevated expression of SOX10/OLIG2 (p < 0.0001)
and ERBB3 (p < 0.0001) and positively enriched for RAS/
MAPK pathway activation by GSEA (Figures S2B–S2D). These
data suggest that the oligoneural CNS-PNET (Picard et al.,
2012) and CNS_NB-FOXR2 (Sturm et al., 2016) subgroups
represent a single tumor entity in humans that can be distin-
guished from other CNS-PNET subgroups by high SOX10/
OLIG2 co-expression. Importantly, these analyses indicate that
zebrafish CNS-PNET-like brain tumors represent an animal
model for the oligoneural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNET subgroup.
Orthotopic Tumor Transplantation Assay Identifies MEK
Inhibitors as Potential Therapies for OLIG2/SOX10-
Expressing CNS-PNETs
There are no established cell lines or animal models of the oligo-
neural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNET subtype, which limits our ability to
discover new therapies that specifically target these tumors.
Therefore, we used the zebrafish oligoneural CNS-PNET model

drocytes in the adjacent tumor-free area. Scale bars, 500 mm (brain with tumor)

 to identify potential therapies for OLIG2/SOX10-expressing
CNS-PNET tumors. We first developed an orthotopic tumor
cell transplantation method using embryonic zebrafish at
2 days post-fertilization (dpf) that allows the rapid propagation
and direct visualization of primary brain tumor cells into hun-
dreds of embryos per day with 80%–90% engraftment effi-
ciency, as the adaptive immune system has yet to mature at
this stage (Figure 4A). Single-cell suspensions derived from
NRASWT-driven CNS-PNETs were delivered to the lumen of
the fourth ventricle (Figure 4A). At 1 day post-transplantation,
the tumor cells could be visualized by fluorescence microscopy
within the developing brain tissue and cerebral spinal fluid (Fig-
ure 4A, 3 dpf, arrows). Transplanted tumors spread throughout
the brain by 17 dpf and encompassed the entire brain by 7 wpf
(Figure 4A).
Next, we developed a drug treatment regimen (Figure 4B) to
test whether inhibition of the Mapk pathway could prevent tumor
growth in vivo. The AZD6244 compound (ARRY-142886) is an
established MEK inhibitor that is under clinical investigation for
the treatment of multiple cancers, including childhood brain tu-
mors (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01386450). A representative group
of embryos were imaged prior to treatment (Figure 4C, 3 dpf).
Embryos were then randomly divided into groups, treatments
were initiated, and embryos were monitored daily for a 5-day
period. Upon completion of treatments (8 dpf), embryos were
imaged by fluorescence microscopy, and tumor area was quan-
tified (Figure 4C). AZD6244-treated embryos exhibited a signifi-
cantly smaller tumor burden post-treatment compared to
DMSO-treated embryos (Figure 4C). Similar results were ob-
tained with the MEK inhibitor U0126 (Figures S3A and S3B).
DMSO- and inhibitor-treated embryos had similarly high survival
rates during the course of the 5-day treatment (Figure 4D; Fig-
ure S3C). In addition, immunoblot staining from tumor lysates
showed that MAPK phosphorylation was significantly dimin-
ished in the MEK-inhibitor-treated tumors (Figure 4E). To
determine whether the AZD6244 treatment translated into a
durable response, we next monitored the juvenile and adult
fish from both AZD6244 and DMSO treatment groups weekly
for 8 weeks. Remarkably, only 21% of the AZD6244-treated
fish displayed visible tumors at 8 weeks post-treatment
compared to 88% of the DMSO-treated fish (Figure 4F; Movies
S1 and S2), and AZD6244-treated fish exhibited a significantly
higher post-treatment survival (Figure 4D). In addition, many of
the DMSO-treated tumors had metastasized throughout the
spinal cord by 8 weeks post-treatment, while none of the
AZD6244-treated tumor fish showed evidence of metastasis
(Movies S1 and S2). These results show that MEK inhibitors
are extremely effective at eliminating sox10/olig2-expressing
CNS-PNET in vivo and, at the doses and times used, confer min-
imal toxicity to WT tissues.
In summary, we show that activation of NRAS signaling in
sox10-expressing zebrafish OPCs drives the formation of CNS
PNET-like tumors that share remarkable conservation with hu-
man oligoneural/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNETs. We take advantage
of the scalability and imaging properties of the zebrafish system
to design a rapid drug-screening platform and show that MEK in-
hibitors potently and durably reverse CNS-PNET-like growth
in vivo without obvious effects on other tissues, including the
developing brain. Thus, our findings suggest that MEK inhibitors
could be an effective therapeutic approach for children with
embryonal tumors expressing SOX10 and OLIG2. Furthermore,
these studies provide the foundation to rapidly evaluate potential
genetic drivers of different CNS tumors in zebrafish, including
candidate fusion oncogenes and epigenetic modifiers identified
in large-scale genomic screens for MB and pediatric glioma (Pa-
shos et al., 2013). Our phenotypic drug-screening platform also
provides a complementary approach to allow rapid and inexpen-
sive identification of compounds that reverse tumor growth,
invasion and/or metastasis of brain cancers. Finally, the embry-
onic brain transplantation method could be readily modified to
accommodate human cancer cells to generate patient-derived
xenograph (PDX) models of childhood brain cancers for future
small-molecule drug screening, similar to methods described
for adult glioblastoma cell lines (Welker et al., 2016).

Zebrafish were maintained and bred as described previously (Westerfield,
1993), and all procedures were approved by the University of Utah Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Tumor Generation, Tumor Onset, and Survival
At 24 hr post-injection of DNA constructs, embryos were screened and sorted
for the expression of mCherry. Starting at 4–6 weeks, fish were screened
weekly using a wide-fluorescence microscope for the onset of red tumor
masses in the CNS. To generate survival curves, mitfaw2; p53M214K tumor-
bearing fish injected with sox10:mCherry-NRASWT (two sets, n = 69) or
sox10:mCherry-NRASQ61R (three sets, n = 57) were monitored visually in tanks
weekly and by fluorescence microscopy bi-weekly. Fish were sacrificed when
tumor burden increased to approximately 20% of the total body size or
impaired the animal’s ability to swim, feed, or behave normally. Thus, values
plotted in the survival curve (Figure 1D) are determined by the date of sacrifice.
For details about the injection procedure, preservation of culled fish, and
experiments using mitfaw2; p53M214K fish, see Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Figure 3. Zebrafish NRASWT-Driven Tumors Show Gene Expression Signatures that Are Predictive of Oligoneural Progenitors and Pediatric
Tumors
(A) Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on genes that were differentially expressed between NRASWT-driven tumors and normal zebrafish brain
(left) or genes that were differentially expressed between published human CNS-PNETs (GEO: GSE14295) and normal fetal brain (right). Gene sets identified in
these analyses and their general biological categories are indicated to the left. NES, normalized enrichment score; FDR, false discovery rate; ES, embryonic stem;
EMT, epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
(B) Heatmap showing gene expression in zebrafish NRASWT-derived tumors and normal brain tissue arranged to highlight comparison to the top 60 genes up- and
downregulated in human OLIG2+/SOX10+ CNS-PNETs compared to fetal brain. SOX10, OLIG2, and ERBB3 genes are highlighted.
(C) Principal-component analysis (PCA) showing zebrafish NRASWT-derived tumors cluster with the OLIG2/SOX10-expressing human CNS-PNETs based on the
oligoneural gene list generated by Picard et al. (2012) or the CNS_NB-FOXR2 gene list generated by Sturm et al. (2016). z, zebrafish; h, human.

 Figure 4. Drug Screens Using an Embryonic
Brain Tumor Transplantation Assay Identify
MEK as a Therapeutic Target for Oligoneu-
ral/NB-FOXR2 CNS-PNET-like Tumors
(A) Tumors derived from the anterior brain of
mitfaw2;
p53M214K; Tg(sox10:mCherry-NRASWT)
transgenic fish were harvested and injected into
the fourth ventricle (outlined in red) of a 2-dpf
mitfw2 embryo (top panels). The following day
(3 dpf), successful injections were visualized by
immunofluorescence, and some tumor cells could
be found in the surrounding brain (arrows). By
17 dpf, tumor cells had proliferated and invaded
the surrounding tissue. At 7 wpf, the tumor cells
had spread throughout the brain.
(B) Schematic describing the timeline for the or-
thotopic embryonic transplantation method and
drug treatment.
(C) Representative images of mCherry expression
in embryos at 24 hr post-transplantation before
treatment (3 dpf) and embryos treated daily for
5 days (8 dpf) with DMSO or MEK inhibitor
AZD6244. Quantification of immunofluorescence
on the final day of treatment (8 dpf) shows a
significant decrease in the transplanted tumor
mass in AZD6244-treated embryos compared to
control.
(D) Survival analysis of embryos during drug
treatment
(3–8
dpf)
shows
that
DMSO
and
AZD6244 do not cause significant toxicity at
doses used, while survival analysis from 8 dpf to
9 wpf shows that AZD6244-treated embryos
have significantly higher post-treatment survival
(p = 0.045). Averages in (C) and (D) represent three
independent experiments (±SEM) for each panel.
(E) Western blot showing that MEK inhibitors
U0126 and AZD6244 inhibit Mapk signaling in
zebrafish NRASWT-driven brain tumor cells treated
ex vivo. (For U0126 treatment results, see Fig-

 Orthotopic Embryonic Transplants
Tumor cells were injected into the fourth ventricle of each embryo and then
transferred into fresh egg water. Twenty-four hours later, embryos were
screened using a fluorescent microscope to ensure consistent engraftment
sizes. Successfully transplanted embryos were placed in tanks to grow or
treated with drugs, as described later. For further details about the transplan-
tation procedure, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
In Vivo Drug Treatment
Transplants were randomly distributed into two treatment groups: DMSO or
drug (AZD6244 or U0126). Embryos were placed in 12-well plates, 10–12
per well in 0.5 mL of egg water with either DMSO or 50 mM drug, and plates
were moved to 28�C. Treatments were refreshed daily for 5 days. Embryos
were imaged and rinsed with egg water, and each treatment group was com-
bined and placed in separate tanks to grow for 8 weeks. At 9 wpf, fish were
screened by fluorescence microscopy for presence of a tumor mass and
euthanized with Tricaine-S. For further details about both in vivo and ex vivo
drug treatment, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Transplant Quantification
Fluorescent images of tumor transplants were acquired on the fifth day of
treatment (8 dpf). Tumor area for each embryo was quantified using ImageJ.
For each treatment, the average tumor area was calculated after removing
the smallest and largest numbers (to control for outliers). Average tumor
area for DMSO-treated embryos was set to 100% for each experiment.
Detailed quantification procedures are described in Supplemental Experi-
mental Procedures.
GSEA, Heatmaps, and PCA
Rank lists for GSEA were generated using zebrafish normal brain (n = 8) versus
tumor (n = 7) and human normal brain versus CNS-PNETs (GEO: GSE14295;
26 CNS_PNETs and 7 normal fetal brains). Analysis was performed using
GSEA v2.2.2 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea).
The human CNS-PNET rank-ordered gene list was generated from the GEO:
GSE14295 dataset (eight OLIG2/SOX10 high CNS PNETs and seven normal
fetal brains). To generate heatmaps, human genes were ranked based on
fold change. Human genes that were not present in the zebrafish dataset
(i.e., human ortholog not present in zebrafish) were removed. The top 60 up-
and downregulated genes were then selected for comparison to zebrafish
tumors (RNA-seq datasets from zebrafish tumors and control brains can be
accessed via GEO: GSE80768). Zebrafish tumor and normal brain gene
expression with p < 0.05 was represented using mean centered log2 FPKM
(fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped) values. For
further details about RNA-seq analysis and the generation of heatmaps, see
Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
PCA of human and zebrafish samples was performed based on published
gene lists defining CNS-PNET subtypes (Picard et al., 2012; Sturm et al.,
2016). Human microarray expression (GEO: GSE14295 and GSE73038) and
zebrafish RNA-seq FKPM values were log2 transformed and then mean
centered and scaled by sample. PCA data were generated using the R function
prcomp (R 3.2.2) with centering and scaling turned off. Plots show the scores
for the first two principal components.
Western Analysis, Immunohistochemistry, Cloning, and Image
Acquisition and Processing
Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2)(Thr202/Tyr204) antibody (cat. no. 9101) from
Cell Signaling Technology was used in immunohistochemistry on human and
zebrafish tumor samples. For detailed procedures, see the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism software.
The Mantel-Cox test was used to calculate the statistical significance of animal
survival data. The Student’s t test was used to evaluate statistical significance
for embryonic transplant quantification and drug treatment survival. Error bars
represent ± SEM.
