BACKGROUND: Few studies have prospectively examined the relationship between vitamin D status and prostate cancer risk in black
men, a group at high risk for both low vitamin D status and prostate cancer. METHODS: Among black men in the Prostate, Lung, Co-
lorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we identified 226 prostate cancer cases and 452 controls matched on age at randomiza-
tion (65 years), date of blood draw (630 days), calendar year of cohort entry, and time since baseline prostate cancer screening
(61 year). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the asso-
ciations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio, and prostate
cancer risk. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D was not associated with overall prostate cancer (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.40-1.33; P for
trend 5 .25), although there were apparent inverse associations for nonaggressive disease (global P 5 .03, clinical stage I/II, and Glea-
son score <7) and among men �62 years old (P for interaction 5 .04) that were restricted to Q3. Interestingly, serum DBP was significantly
inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-1.00; P for trend 5 .03), whereas the 25(OH)D:DBP molar
ratio was not. Results were similar when we mutually adjusted for 25(OH)D and DBP, and we found no evidence of interaction between the
two. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests higher (versus lower) circulating DBP may be independently associated with a decreased
prostate cancer risk in black men independent of 25(OH)D status. Cancer 2017;123:2698-704. V

INTRODUCTION
Along with family history of prostate cancer and older age, black race (ie, African ancestry) is an established risk factor for
prostate cancer.1 Black men in the United States have 70% higher incidence and more than double the prostate cancer
mortality compared with white men and experience some of the highest rates of prostate cancer globally.2 This excess dis-
ease burden is compounded by diagnoses at earlier ages and of greater aggressiveness.3 At the same time, the higher preva-
lence of low vitamin D status in black individuals compared with other racial/ethnic groups4 is attributable to both higher
melanin content in darker skin, which reduces the synthesis of vitamin D3 from 7-dehydrocholesterol in response to solar
ultraviolet B radiation,5 and lower dietary and supplemental vitamin D intake.6 The fact that black men compared with
white men experience higher prostate cancer rates and lower vitamin D status is of interest given the possible etiological
role of the latter in this malignancy.7
Regardless of the source, vitamin D undergoes two hydroxylation steps, first in the liver to synthesize 25-
hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, then in the kidney where the biologically ac-
tive form, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)2D] is produced.8 Approximately 99% of 25(OH)D is bound to serum
proteins, primarily vitamin D binding protein (DBP), leaving a small fraction of unbound or “free” 25(OH)D.9 The anti-
carcinogenic potential of vitamin D demonstrated in laboratory studies of prostate cells7,8 contrasts with data from a
meta-analysis of epidemiological studies conducted in predominantly non-Hispanic white men. These data suggest that

 higher circulating vitamin D increases prostate cancer
risk,10 a finding that would seem to conflict empirically
with the low vitamin D status and high prostate cancer
rates experienced by black men.7 There remains, however,
a paucity of research examining the relationship between
black race, vitamin D status, and prostate cancer risk.11-17
In this prospective nested case-control study, we ex-
amine the association between prostate cancer risk and se-
rum vitamin D status among black men in the Prostate,
Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening
Trial.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study Population
The PLCO Trial is a large-scale randomized cancer
screening trial that enrolled approximately 155,000 men
and women aged 55-74 years between 1993 and 2001
from 10 screening centers across the United States.18 Men
assigned to the screening arm had prostate-specific anti-
gen (PSA) measured at baseline and annually for 5 years
thereafter, as well as a digital rectal examination at baseline
and annually for 3 years.18 Men with elevated serum PSA
levels (ie, PSA >4.0 ng/mL) or suspicious digital rectal ex-
amination findings were referred for diagnostic evalua-
tion. Incident prostate cancers were ascertained from
annually mailed questionnaires completed by participants
and subsequently confirmed through medical record
reviews.18 Approval for the study was obtained from the
institutional review boards of the National Cancer Insti-
tute and each of the screening centers, and participants
provided written informed consent.
Case and Control Selection
The screening arm of the trial included 1713 self-
identified non-Hispanic black men who had no history of
prostate cancer, completed the baseline questionnaire,
and had serum available. Among these men, we identified
226 cases of incident prostate cancer diagnosed through
the end of follow-up on December 31, 2009. Controls (n
5 452) were selected from among black men with avail-
able serum who were cancer-free at the time of the case di-
agnosis, and matched 2:1 to cases on age at randomization
(65 years), date of blood draw (630 days), calendar year
of study entry, and time since baseline prostate cancer
screening (61 year).
Serum 25(OH)D and DBP
Nonfasting baseline blood was collected at each screening
visit, processed, and stored at 2708C.19 All samples were
blinded, and case-control matched sets were assayed
within the same batch at Heartland Assay, LLC (Ames,
IA). Each batch contained serum quality control material.
Serum 25(OH)D was measured by way of liquid chroma-
tography/mass spectrometry. DBP concentrations were
measured by commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) (GenWay, San Diego, CA) using a poly-
clonal antibody in a sandwich format. The interassay coef-
ficient of variation was 9.4% for 25(OH)D and 19.5%
for DBP. The intraassay coefficient of variation was
10.9% for 25(OH)D and 16.7% for DBP.
Covariates
Participants in the screening arm of the study completed a
questionnaire at study entry capturing information on
race/ethnicity, education, smoking habits, physical activi-
ty, medical history, family history of cancer, and prostate
health (eg, history of benign prostatic hypertrophy), and a
separate dietary/supplement use questionnaire.
Statistical Analysis
Case and control distributions of select baseline character-
istics were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum and chi-
square tests for continuous and categorical variables, re-
spectively. The primary analyses used conditional logistic
regression to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) for the association between
25(OH)D, DBP, and the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio
and overall prostate cancer, with unconditional logistic re-
gression used for stratified analyses to retain case-control
sets with different subgroup classification. To address sea-
sonal variation in 25(OH)D, we created season-specific
exposure categories based on the distribution among con-
trols, with separate quartiles created for lighter months
(May-October) and darker months (November-April),
then combined them for analysis. We also season-
standardized 25(OH)D by regressing log-transformed
25(OH)D concentrations on week of blood draw using a
locally weighted polynomial regression method20 and an-
alyzed the association using predefined clinical cut-points
(<25, 25-<37.5, 37.5-<50, 50-<75 [referent], �75
nmol/L). Quartiles of 25(OH)D:DBP, a proxy for un-
bound circulating 25(OH)D,21 and DBP (nmol/L),
which does not vary by season,22 were calculated based on
the distribution in the controls.
Potential confounders included: study center, PSA,
body mass index (18.5-<25.0, 25-30, and >30 kg/m2),
smoking status (nonsmoker, current smoker, or former
smoker), physical activity (hours per week [none, <1, 1,
2, 3, or 41]), history of diabetes, family history of pros-
tate cancer, marital status (married/living as married,

 widowed, separated/divorced, and never married), educa-
tion (less than high school, high school graduate, some
college/vocational, college graduate, postgraduate), and
calcium and vitamin D intake (dietary and supplements).
Only baseline PSA resulted in a >10% change in the pa-
rameter estimate for vitamin D. Additionally, although
uncorrelated with 25(OH)D (Pearson correlation coeffi-
cient r 5 20.02, P 5 .68), PSA was higher among men
in the first quartile of 25(OH)D relative to those in Q2-
Q4. Exclusion of outlying PSA values (>2 SD) did not al-
ter findings; therefore, these values were retained. Our
analyses therefore included examination of three models:
1) conditioned on matching factors only; 2) model 1 mu-
tually adjusted for 25(OH)D or DBP; and 3) model 2 ad-
justed for baseline PSA. All subsequently reported ORs
and 95% CIs are based on model 3.
In secondary analyses, we stratified by aggressive dis-
ease (Gleason sum �7 or tumor-node-metastasis clinical
stage III or IV) and nonaggressive disease (clinical stage I
and II with Gleason sum <7), median DBP for the associa-
tions with 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D:DBP, median
25(OH)D for the DBP association, median age at entry
(62 years), body mass index (27.6 kg/m2), and season of
blood draw. Cross-product terms between the main vita-
min D effect (quartiles) and subgroup factors (binary based
on medians for continuous variables) were added to models
to test effect modification. To examine whether the associa-
tion between vitamin D and prostate cancer differed by dis-
ease aggressiveness while also maintaining the case-control
match set and adjusting for covariates, we tested whether
the beta coefficients obtained from disease-specific (aggres-
sive vs nonaggressive disease) conditional logistic regression
models differed. Sensitivity analyses were conducted
restricting to men (and their matched controls) with �1
and �2 years between their baseline blood collection and
diagnosis. Linear trends were evaluated by modeling ordi-
nal categorical variables or category-specific medians as
continuous variables and testing the statistical significance
using the Wald test. All analyses used a 2-sided alpha (type
I error) level of 0.05, and were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Of the 226 prostate cancer cases, 101 were aggressive and
125 were nonaggressive. The average age at baseline was 63
years, and the median time from blood collection to pros-
tate cancer diagnosis was 4.1 years, with 66 cases (�29%)
diagnosed within the first 2 years. The median serum con-
centrations for 25(OH)D and DBP were 46.1 nmol/L
(range, 7.5-164.3) and 7316 nmol/L (range, 2584-14149),
respectively, and the median dietary and total vitamin D
intakes were 170 and 265 IU/d, respectively.
Selected baseline characteristics are presented in
Table 1. Only serum PSA differed significantly between
cases and controls (median, 3.2 ng/mL and 1.0 ng/mL,
respectively), with family history of prostate cancer, and
most other factors, including 25(OH)D and DBP, being
similar. Among controls, DBP was uncorrelated with
25(OH)D (r 5 0.08, P 5 .10), but inversely correlated
with 25(OH)D:DBP (r 5 20.44, P < .0001). Baseline

 age was modestly correlated with 25(OH)D (r 5 0.17, P
5 .0004), DBP (r 5 20.10, P 5 .03), and their molar ra-
tio (r 5 0.20, P < .0001).
Season-specific serum 25(OH)D was not associated
with overall prostate cancer risk in multivariate models
(Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.40-1.33; P for trend 5
.25) (Table 2). We obtained similar results using season-
standardized quartiles, clinically defined cut-points, and
season-specific quintiles of 25(OH)D as defined in a pre-
vious analysis of white men in the PLCO Trial23 (Sup-
porting Table 1). Serum DBP was inversely associated
with prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.45; 95% CI,
0.20-1.00; P for trend 5 .03), including after adjustment
for 25(OH)D. We observed no risk association for the
25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio (Table 2).
With regard to our secondary analyses, we found no
association between serum 25(OH)D and aggressive pros-
tate cancer risk, whereas a U-shaped association was evident
for risk of nonaggressive disease, with a statistically inverse
OR in Q3 (global P 5 .03, P for difference in the beta coef-
ficients by aggressiveness 5 .09) (Table 3). The inverse as-
sociation for DBP did not differ by cancer aggressiveness (P
for difference in the beta coefficients by disease aggressive-
ness 5 .89) (Table 3). The associations between prostate
cancer and 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D:DBP were not modi-
fied by DBP (P for interaction 5 .22 and .37, respectively).
The DBP risk association also was not modified by
25(OH)D [Q4 vs Q1: below median 25(OH)D: OR,
0.90; 95% CI, 0.42-1.91; above median 25(OH)D: OR,
0.75; 95% CI:0.34-1.67; P for interaction 5 .81), and the
associations for 25(OH)D, DBP, and their molar ratio did
not differ by season of blood draw (P for interaction > .05
for each). Age modified the association between 25(OH)D
and prostate cancer (P for interaction 5 .04) such that
25(OH)D appeared to be inversely associated with prostate
cancer risk in older men, but again restricted to Q3 (Sup-
porting Table 2). Family history of prostate cancer, history
of diabetes, physical activity, and smoking status did not
modify the vitamin D associations (data not shown). Sensi-
tivity analyses restricted to cases (and their matched con-
trols) diagnosed �1 year after blood collection revealed
somewhat stronger inverse associations for 25(OH)D (OR,
0.61, 0.44, and 0.62 for Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively, vs
Q1; P for trend 5 .14) and similarly for �2 years (OR,
0.54, 0.39, and 0.58; P for trend 5 .12). Similar inverse
patterns of association were also observed for DBP
(�1 year OR, 1.05, 0.70, and 0.47; P for trend 5 .05;
�2 year OR, 1.19, 0.78, and 0.52; P for trend 5 .08) (data
not shown).
DISCUSSION
The present study is one of the few prospective examina-
tions of the association between vitamin D and prostate
cancer in black men, and to our knowledge, it is the first

 to evaluate the influence of the vitamin D binding protein
(DBP) and estimated “free” or unbound 25(OH)D in
this population. Serum 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D:DBP
were not associated with overall prostate cancer risk, al-
though 25(OH)D appeared inversely associated with
nonaggressive disease, with a similar pattern of association
in older men. There was a significantly lower prostate can-
cer risk among men with higher circulating DBP concen-
trations, which represents a novel finding.
Most research regarding the association between vita-
min D and prostate cancer has been conducted in predomi-
nately white populations or has been adjusted for race/
ethnicity without providing race-specific risk estimates.24
Overall, these studies do not support an inverse risk rela-
tion, with a meta-analysis of 21 studies (including 20 pro-
spective studies) of nearly 12,000 mostly non-Hispanic
white cases finding that higher circulating 25(OH)D was
related to higher prostate cancer risk (pooled OR, 1.17;
95% CI, 1.05-1.30).10 This meta-analysis included the
analysis of white men in the PLCO Trial, which showed a
positive association between 25(OH)D status and risk of
aggressive disease.23 The present analysis of black men in
the PLCO Trial suggests a weak inverse association with
nonaggressive disease and a nonsignificant positive associa-
tion with aggressive disease, consistent with the previous
study of white men in the PLCO Trial.23
Previous investigations of black men have been
largely retrospective12,14,17 or cross-sectional analyses,13

 both of which are limited with respect to establishing a
temporal relationship between vitamin D and prostate
cancer risk. Only two race-specific studies examined the
association between prediagnostic circulating 25(OH)D
and prostate cancer risk in black men.15,16 A nested case-
control analysis within the Multiethnic Cohort Study
found no association based on 136 black cases, the racial
group with the lowest plasma 25(OH)D (<50 nmol/L vs
�75 nmol/L; OR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.64-1.66).15 Similarly,
the case-cohort analysis of 250 black cases in the Selenium
and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT)
showed no association between vitamin D status and over-
all prostate cancer risk (�75 nmol/L vs <37.5 nmol/L;
hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% CI, 0.50-1.40). However,
higher vitamin D status did appear related to lower risk of
Gleason 7-10 prostate cancer (�75 nmol/L vs <37.5
nmol/L; HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.19-1.18; P for trend 5
.048).16 In the current study, we observed a suggestive in-
verse association between 25(OH)D and non-aggressive
prostate cancer risk, that was strongest and statistically sig-
nificant in Q3 (40-68 nmol/L) versus Q1 (<39 nmol/L).
This is not unlike the U-shaped pattern of association ob-
served among all men in SELECT, which was also stron-
ger and statistically significant in Q3 (58.2-72.9 nmol/L)
versus Q1 (<44.1 nmol/L) for total, Gleason 2-6, Glea-
son 7-10, and Gleason 8-10 prostate cancer.16
Beyond its role as the primary transport protein for
25(OH)D, one of the biological functions of DBP (or
group-specific component, Gc protein) involves macro-
phage activation25 through the inflammation-primed
macrophage-activating factor (MAF), with Gc-MAF26
having been shown to inhibit angiogenesis and growth/
proliferation in pancreatic27 and prostate malignant
cells.28 Racial differences in common variants in GC, the
gene encoding DBP, have been established,25 and one of
the three common GC phenotypes, Gc 1F-1F, which is
most common in populations of African descent (and
least common in European populations),25 has the highest
Gc-MAF activity.26 The potential antiangiogenic and
antiproliferative activity of Gc-MAF, with notably higher
activity in Gc1F-1F carriers, could partially explain the in-
verse association between DBP and prostate cancer risk in
the present analysis. It might also account for the finding
in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Preven-
tion (ATBC) Study of white men where DBP was only as-
sociated (inversely) with prostate cancer risk in men with
lower 25(OH)D.29 This finding appears consistent with
the inverse association between DBP and prostate cancer
observed in the present study of black men with relatively
low 25(OH)D.
Our study has several strengths, including the pro-
spective design, which allowed us to overcome issues of
temporality common in previous evaluations of the asso-
ciation between vitamin D and prostate cancer in black
men. In addition to measuring 25(OH)D, which captures
all sources of vitamin D exposure, we examined the influ-
ence of its primary transport carrier, vitamin D binding
protein. The limitations of our study include the relatively
small sample size and low power for the secondary analy-
ses. As such, results from this study should be interpreted
cautiously, and larger prospective studies or consortia of
black populations will be better equipped to address the
relationship between vitamin D and prostate cancer in
this racial group. Our primary results may have also been
influenced by some men having preclinical disease at base-
line; however, the consistent inverse pattern of associa-
tions for serum 25(OH)D and DBP observed when
excluding cases with fewer than 1 or 2 years between base-
line and diagnosis suggests the findings were not biased in
this manner. Findings from our secondary analyses are of
interest, including those regarding age and disease aggres-
siveness, but were particularly underpowered and should
be considered hypothesis-generating. With regard to the
measurement of DBP, the polyclonal assay performed
suboptimally, likely attenuating the observable associa-
tions. Use of this newly developed assay was necessary,
however, to avoid spuriously low DBP concentrations
obtained with the more commonly used monoclonal as-
say, which, unlike the polyclonal assay, does not recognize
a range of genetically determined DBP protein isoforms
common in black populations.30
In this prospective study of black men, a group at
high risk of both vitamin D deficiency and prostate cancer,
we found that serum DBP was inversely associated with
prostate cancer risk independent of 25(OH)D status. This
finding, as well as the suggestive inverse association ob-
served between 25(OH)D and nonaggressive disease, re-
quire replication in other studies and investigation of
potential biological mechanisms. Further prospective re-
search is needed to clarify whether (and how) race modifies
the association between vitamin D and prostate cancer.
