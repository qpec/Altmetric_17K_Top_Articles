ABSTRACT  
OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether low-dose aspirin (<300 mg/d) can influence the onset of 
cognitive impair- ment or dementia in observational studies and improve cognitive test scores in 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in participants without dementia. DESIGN: Systematic review 
and meta-analysis. SETTING: Observational and interventional studies. PARTICIPANTS: 
Individuals with no dementia or cogni- tive impairment initially.  MEASUREMENTS: Odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confi- dence intervals (CIs), adjusted for the maximum number of covariates from each 
study, were used to summarize data on the incidence of dementia and cognitive impair- ment in 
observational studies. Standardized mean differ- ences (SMDs) were used for cognitive test scores in 
RCTs. RESULTS: Of 2,341 potentially eligible articles, eight studies were included and provided data 
for 36,196 partic- ipants without dementia or cognitive impairment at base- line (mean age 66, 63% 
female). After adjusting for a median of three potential confounders over a median fol- low-up period 
of 6 years, chronic use of low-dose aspirin was not associated with onset of dementia or cognitive 
impairment (5 studies, N = 26,159; OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.55–1.22, P = .33, I2 = 67%). In three RCTs 
(N = 10,037; median follow-up 5 years), the use of low- dose aspirin was not associated with 
significantly better global cognition (SMD=0.005, 95% CI=–0.04–0.05, P = .84, I2 = 0%) in 
individuals without dementia. Adher- ence was lower in participants taking aspirin than in con- trols, 
and the incidence of adverse events was higher. CONCLUSION: This review found no evidence that 
low- dose aspirin buffers against cognitive decline or dementia or improves cognitive test scores in 
RCTs. J Am Geriatr Soc 2017.

INTRODUCTION 
Low-dose aspirin is often used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) due to its anti-
thrombotic properties.1,2 Aspirin has anti-inflammatory properties and inflammation plays a pivotal role 
in several diseases.4 Preclinical models suggest that aspirin may decrease neuroinflammation and 
oxidative stress in the central nervous system (CNS).5,6 These pleiotropic mechanisms of action of 
aspirin could aid in the prevention of cognitive decline or dementia.  
 
Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular conditions are established risk factors for poor cognitive status and 
dementia.7–9 The relationship between vascular disease and cognitive decline and dementia can 
explained by the atherosclerotic process leading to plaque development and reduced oxygen 
availability to the brain.10 Dementia and cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases share several risk factors, 
particularly with diabetes-mellitus.11,12 
 
There has been growing interest in the use of drugs of a similar nature to aspirin, such as nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for the prevention of dementia14. An increasing body of research is 
suggesting a potential role for aspirin in the prevention of poor cognitive status. Since dementia is 
irreversible, understanding if low-dose aspirin is useful for the prevention of cognitive decline and 
improvement of cognitive function of those without dementia is important. A Cochrane systematic 
review including one RCT (n=70) published 15 years ago demonstrated no benefit in aspirin preventing 
vascular-dementia.13 Since that time, further evidence has become available and an updated 
comprehensive meta-analysis is required.  
 
Given the aforementioned limitations in the literature, this paper had the following aims.  1) Investigate 
whether low-dose aspirin use is associated with the onset of dementia and poor cognitive status in 
 5 
 
observational studies. 2) whether low-dose aspirin usage results in improved cognitive test scores in 
RCTs among people without cognitive impairment/dementia. We hypothesized that low-dose aspirin 
could have a favorable role on cognition.

METHODS 
This systematic review adhered to the PRISMA 16 and MOOSE 17 statements,  and followed an a priori 
defined, but unpublished protocol. 
 
Data sources and literature search strategy 
Two investigators (NV and MS) independently searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane 
Central Register of Controlled Trials and Clinicaltrials.gov without language restrictions, from 
database inception until September 1st, 2016.  Observational studies and RCTs investigating the effect 
of oral low-dose aspirin on the incidence of dementia and/or test scores assessing cognitive function in 
people without dementia/cognitive impairment at baseline were included. In PubMed, the following 
search strategy was used: (Aspirin OR acetylsalicylic acid) AND (cognit*). Conference abstracts and 
reference lists of included articles were hand-searched to identify any potential additional relevant 
articles. Any inconsistencies were resolved by consensus. 
 
Study selection  
Inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were: i) use of an RCT or longitudinal study design; ii) use of 
low-dose aspirin (i.e. a daily dosage<300 mg18); iii) reporting data on dementia diagnosed through 
validated criteria; iv) reporting data of cognitive tests of global (e.g. mini-mental state examination, 
MMSE19) or specific cognitive functions in adults without dementia or cognitive impairment.  
 
Studies were excluded if: i) not conducted in humans; ii) used a non-placebo control group (active 
controls, in RCTs); iii) used dosages of aspirin with anti-inflammatory aims (i.e. with a dosage >300 
mg/daily or for brief periods, i.e. less than one year); iv) a standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds 
ratio (OR) could not be computed from the available data. If we encountered studies that did not 
 7 
 
provide sufficient data for the meta-analysis, we contacted the authors twice over a month period to 
request additional data. 
 
Data extraction  
Two investigators (NV and BS) extracted data from the articles in a standardized file and a third 
independent investigator (MS) validated data extraction. We extracted data about authors, year of 
publication, country, setting, demographics (i.e. sample size, mean age and percentage of women), 
follow-up duration, diagnostic criteria or tests used for the diagnosis of dementia and cognitive 
impairment, daily dosage of aspirin. In longitudinal studies, we extracted the number and type of 
covariates used in the multivariate analyses. Moreover, we extracted data by treated with low-dose 
aspirin and controls. If information was missing, first and/or corresponding authors of the original 
article were contacted at least two times in a month.  
 
Outcomes 
For longitudinal studies, the primary outcome was the incidence of dementia or cognitive impairment 
during follow-up in the longitudinal studies. Dementia was ascertained through validated criteria, 
whilst cognitive impairment was ascertained according to predefined cut-offs of standardized tests for 
assessing cognitive status (i.e. a MMSE score < 24/30) 19.  
For RCTs, changes between follow-up and baseline of tests assessing cognition (such as global 
cognition, verbal memory or fluency) were extracted for participants without dementia or cognitive 
impairment at baseline in the group taking aspirin and in the control group (placebo/no intervention).

Assessment of study quality 
Two authors (NV, BS) assessed the quality of the studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to 
evaluate longitudinal studies 20 and the Jadad’s scale21 for assessing the quality of the RCTs.  
 
Data synthesis and statistical analysis  
All analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) 3 (http://www.meta-
analysis.com).  
 
In the primary analysis, we compared the data regarding the incidence of dementia and cognitive 
impairment in people using low-dose aspirin vs. no treatment using the ORs with their 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs), adjusted for the maximum number of covariates available for each study. In the co-
primary analysis, we compared cognitive tests values between participants treated with low dose 
aspirin vs. controls (placebo or no intervention). We calculated the difference between the means of the 
treatment and control groups, using the changes between follow-up and baseline data for each group, 
through SMD with 95% CIs. In all the analyses, a random-effect model was applied. 22 
 
Heterogeneity across studies was assessed by the I2 metric and Cochran’s Q chi-square statistics with a 
value>50% for the first and p <0.05 indicating the presence of a significant heterogeneity. 23  
 
Publication bias was assessed by visually inspecting funnel plots and the Begg-Mazumdar Kendall 
tau24 and the Egger bias test.25 To account for publication bias, we used the trim-and-fill method, to 
adjust for any potential unpublished (imputed) studies.26 
For all analyses, p<.05 was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS 
Search results 
Altogether, the search yielded 2,341 non-duplicated articles. After excluding 2,325 articles based on 
title/abstract review, 16 articles were retrieved for full text review and eight studies (5 longitudinal27–31  
and 3 RCTs 32–34) were included (Supplementary Figure S1). Overall eight studies were excluded 
since they included active controls (i.e. people taking another drug, n=3), investigated acute effects of 
aspirin on cognition (i.e. a daily dose over 300 mg used for analgesic aims, n=2), were reviews (n=1),a 
protocol (n=1) or reported data as linear regression estimates, thus not meta-analyzable (n=1). 
 
Study and participants’ characteristics 
 
Full descriptive details of the included studies are reported in Supplementary Tables S 1-2.  
 
This meta-analysis included 36,196 participants, of which 8,484 (23.4%) received low-dose aspirin. 
The mean age was 66 years and the participants were mainly women (63%). All the studies were 
conducted among community-dwellers and in Europe (6 studies) or USA (2 studies).  
 
Longitudinal studies 
The five longitudinal studies27–31 included 26,159 community-dwelling participants with a mean age of 
65.1 years, mainly women for a median follow-up period of 6 years. Three studies27,29,30 investigated 
dementia as outcome, whilst the other two28,31 considered cognitive impairment (Supplementary 
Table S1). The quality of the studies was sufficient (NOS mean 6, 6-7)..20 
Among the 26,159 participants, 3035 (11.6%) used low-dose aspirin. The participants using low-dose 
aspirin at baseline were significantly older (78.1±5.3 vs. 75.9±6.4 years, p<0.0001), whilst no 
differences emerged regarding the percentage of women (64% vs. 69%, p=0.15).  
 10 
 
RCTs 
The three RCTs32–34 (two versus placebo32,34 and one33 as add-on therapy) included 10,037 participants 
aged on average 66.8 years, mainly women (74%). The median follow-up period was 5 years (range: 3-
9.6). One RCT33 used the MMSE score as tool for cognitive status, whilst the other two32,34 used 
several tests, as shown in Supplementary Table S2.  The quality of the studies was good.21  
 
Meta-analysis of longitudinal studies 
After adjusting for a median of 3 potential confounders (range: 0-7), the use of low-dose aspirin was 
not associated with any significant reduction in the onset of dementia or cognitive impairment (5 
studies; OR=0.82; 95%CI: 0.55-1.22; p=0.33; I2=67%; Figure 1). Considering each study separately, 
only one study 29 with the largest cohort available (n=23,915 participants at baseline) reported a 
significant decreased risk of dementia at follow-up, taking in account also 4 potential confounders (see 
Supplementary Table S2). Even though the three studies using dementia as outcome27,29,30 reported a 
lower OR, (0.59 (95%CI: 0.33-1.05; p=0.84; I2=33%) than the other two which examined cognitive 
impairment28,31 [OR=0.96 (95%CI: 0.62-1.51; p=0.66; I2=59%)], the interaction of aspirin use by 
outcome was not significant (p=0.18). After removing one study30 (a conference abstract) the results 
did not significantly change (OR=0.72; 95%CI: 0.47-1.10; p=0.14; I2=70%), with the studies assessing 
dementia reporting an OR=0.59 (95%CI: 0.33-1.05; p=0.07; I2=33%).  
 
Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials 
As reported in Figure 2, the use of low-dose aspirin was not associated with any improvement in 
global cognitive tests in the three RCTs including 10,037 participants32–34 (SMD=0.00; 95%CI: -0.04 to 
0.05; p=0.84; I2=0%). Publication bias was unlikely.   
 
 11 
 
Two studies 32,34 reported information regarding verbal memory and executive function/fluency tests. 
Whilst no significant differences emerged in terms of verbal memory tests (SMD=-0.02; 95%CI: -0.06 
to 0.03; p=0.42; I2=0%), the use of low-dose aspirin was associated with a significant small 
improvement in executive function/fluency tests (SMD=0.06; 95%CI: 0.02 to 0.11; p=0.006; I2=0%). 
This improvement was estimated to correspond to 2.6 years younger age, and a substantial 20% lower 
risk of cognitive decline compared to the use of placebo34 in a single study. 
 
Compliance and adverse effects 
In the three RCTs included, a lower percentage of participants using low-dose aspirin completed the 
RCTs compared to controls (69.9 vs. 75.9%, chi-square test p-value=0.005).  
 
Only two studies (one longitudinal 27 and one RCT 33) reported information regarding side effects. The 
prevalence of gastrointestinal adverse events was ten times higher in people taking aspirin compared to 
controls (15.2% vs. 1.4%, p<0.0001). Whilst the RCT33 did not report the type of gastrointestinal side 
effects, the longitudinal study27 reported a similar incidence of gastric ulcers between those taking and 
not taking aspirin (p=0.17).     
 
 12 
 
DISCUSSION 
In this meta-analysis, we found that the use of low-dose aspirin did not appear to be associated with a 
lower incidence of dementia and cognitive impairment in observational studies. Across RCTs, we 
found no evidence of improvement in cognitive test scores among people who were free from dementia 
or cognitive impairment. However, people using low-dose aspirin experienced a higher frequency of 
side effects (particularly gastrointestinal), although this information is limited to data from two studies.  
 
Several hypotheses might explain these findings. First, the average age of the participants was 65 years. 
Previous research has suggested that the pathological changes typical of dementia happen 20 years 
before the clinical symptoms present 35, therefore the use of low-dose aspirin at this age may be ‘too 
little and/or too late’.  Second, participants may have been taking low dose aspirin for the secondary 
prevention of CVD or related conditions. Thus, pre-existing comorbidities at baseline may have 
interfered with low dose aspirins potential cognitive beneficial effects and explain the null result. 
Finally, genetic factors could play a role in this lack of effect of low-dose aspirin. One study 
investigated if the role of the APOE gene altered the association between nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and dementia risk, and found reduced risk of AD only in NSAID 
users with an APOE epsilon 4 allele.37 Specific research is needed to clarify this potential hypothesis. 
Other factors may have accounted for our result across RCTs which also need to be considered. First, 
the number of people lost during follow-up could have influenced our results. Moreover, some of the 
cognitive tests, such as the MMSE, suffer from important limitations, such as the over estimation of 
cognitive impairments in persons over age 60 and in those with lower educational status.38 In our meta-
analysis, we tried to overcome this issue by using all of the tests available that assessed cognition and 
subcomponents such as executive function/fluency tests which may be improved by aspirin use. 
 13 
 
However, the very small effect size detected in the latter suggests that the clinical significance of these 
findings is probably limited.  
 
Our findings are in partial agreement with two recent meta-analyses considering the use of other 
NSAIDs on cognitive outcomes. While the use of NSAIDs was associated with a 28% decrease in 
dementia onset in the longitudinal studies14, the findings from the RCTs did not support these 
observational findings.39 Taken together, it appears there is no consistent evidence that the use of 
NSAIDs may delay or prevent the onset of either dementia or cognitive impairment over time.  
However future, adequately powered real world investigations are required to better understand if 
aspirin and other NSAIDs can delay or prevent dementia. Based on our findings, we suggest that future 
RCTs including more men and younger people are probably needed. In this context, the ASPREE 
(ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly) study, an ongoing trial including 19,000 healthy 
participants aged 65 years and above could be of importance for better understanding the possible role 
of aspirin in the prevention of dementia and mild cognitive impairment.40 However, particular attention 
should also be given to adherence and any adverse events from such studies and low cost and lower 
risk alternatives such as physical activity41,42 and nutrition interventions43 should also be considered in 
this regard.  
Although few studies provided evidence on adherence and adverse events, the limited available 
evidence suggests that lower adherence could in part be explained by a higher incidence of adverse 
events. Gastrointestinal side effects appear to be particularly troublesome. Some experts have 
suggested that aspirin may lead to an increase in gut permeability (i.e. ‘leaky gut’), which may lead to 
the translocation of bacterial products (e.g. lipopolysaccharide-LPS), which may increase microglial 
activation and therefore neuroinflammation.6,44,45 Bearing in mind the possible limitations of our work, 
 14 
 
these results suggest not only a lack of evidence that aspirin could protect against cognitive 
decline/dementia, but that it may increase adverse gastrointestinal events.  
 
The findings of our meta-analysis should be interpreted within its limitations. First, we only identified a 
limited number of the RCTs. Although these studies were of high quality, with a large sample size and 
long follow-up period, other studies are needed to have a definitive conclusion. Second, the 
observational studies did not use the propensity score in their analyses which is the best method for 
comparing a population taking a drug with another one without.46 Moreover, the possibility of a 
selection bias in longitudinal studies and the fact that a consistent percentage of people not taking 
aspirin took other NSAIDs might create another important bias in our results. Moreover, one study 
included the overwhelming majority of participants and thus could have had a large influence on the 
overall result.28 Another limitation is the high heterogeneity observed in the longitudinal studies and 
that no meta-regression analysis was possible due to the limited number of studies for each outcome.47 
Fourth, no study assessed the effect of low-dose aspirin in reducing dementia risk by APOE epsilon 4 
status, which this could be a relevant factor in establishing a link between aspirin use and cognitive 
decline. It may be possible that only people with this mutation had a reduced risk of dementia when 
taking aspirin as shown by a large study analyzing the interaction between APOE epsilon 4 status and 
NSAIDs.37 Fifth, conclusions on side effects of aspirin are based on only two studies. Finally, although 
we accounted for potential confounding factors when data were available by using adjusted effect 
estimates in our pooled analyses, it was not possible to consider other potentially important, 
unidentified confounders.  For instance, people on low-dose aspirin are more likely to be at risk of, or 
with a history of CVDs than those not on aspirin, and the indications for aspirin may vary across 
countries, and these may be influential factors. Thus, future research should attempt to consider, where 
possible, the impact of such factors on the relationship between aspirin and cognitive outcomes. 
 15 
 
The strengths of our work includes a comprehensive search of several databases, and the inclusion of 
the largest possible number of participants, the long follow-up of each study and that, to the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to consider this issue.  
 
In conclusion, our preliminary meta-analysis suggests that low-dose aspirin does not decrease the risk 
of poor cognitive status (in terms of dementia or cognitive impairment) nor improve cognitive tests in 
randomized controlled trials. Moreover, adherence to aspirin may be lower compared to control 
conditions and adverse events may be more common. Future trials, considering dementia onset as 
outcome, are needed to disentangle if low-dose aspirin could be used to improve cognitive status, and 
to test the possibility that low-dose aspirin has beneficial effects when taken over a longer period and at 
an earlier age than the observed population did.
