Abstract
Background: Postprandial hyperlipidemia is associated with impaired endothelial function. Peanut consumption favorably
affects the lipid and lipoprotein profile; however, the effects on endothelial function remain unclear.
Objective: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effects of acute peanut consumption as part of a high-fat meal on
postprandial endothelial function.
Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled, crossover postprandial study to evaluate the effect of acute peanut
consumption on postprandial lipids and endothelial function as assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial
artery in 15 healthy overweight or obese men [mean age: 26.7 y; mean body mass index (in kg/m2): 31.4]. Participants
consumed, in a randomized order, a peanut meal containing 3 ounces (85 g) ground peanuts (1198 kcal; 40.0% carbohydrate,
47.7% fat, 19.4% saturated fat, 13.2% protein) and a control meal matched for energy and macronutrient content. Meals
were in the form of a shake, scheduled $1 wk apart. Lipids, lipoproteins, glucose, and insulin were measured at baseline
(0 min) and at 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after shake consumption. FMD was measured at baseline and at 240 min.
Results: Acute peanut consumption blunted the serum triglyceride (TG) response 120 and 240 min after consumption
compared with the control meal (means 6 SEMs—120 min: 188.9 6 19.4 compared with 197.5 6 20.7 mg/dL; 240 min:
189.9 6 24.3 compared with 197.3 6 18.4 mg/dL; P < 0.05 for both). Total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol and glucose and
insulin responses were similar between the test meals. Compared with baseline, only the control meal significantly
decreased FMD at 240 min (control: 21.2% 6 0.5%; P = 0.029; peanut: 20.6% 6 0.5%; P = 0.3). Participants with higher
baseline total (>150 mg/dL) and LDL (>100 mg/dL)-cholesterol concentrations showed a significant decrease in FMD after
the control meal (21.8%, P = 0.017; 22.0%, P = 0.038), whereas the peanut meal maintained endothelial function in all
participants irrespective of total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations.
Conclusion: The inclusion of 85 g peanuts (3 ounces) as part of a high-fat meal improved the postprandial TG response and
preserved endothelial function in healthy overweight or obese men. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT01405300.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD)7 remains the leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in the United States and globally.
Several prospective studies have shown that the postprandial in-
crease in nonfasting serum TGs increases the risk of atherosclerosis
and ischemic stroke and is an independent risk factor for coronary
artery disease (1–4). Evidence from the Women�s Health Study,
a prospective study in 26,509 participants followed for a

 median of 11.4 y, reported that TGs measured 2–4 h after the
last meal was a stronger predictor of events than were fasting TG
concentrations (5). In addition, postprandial hypertriglyceride-
mia is involved in proinflammatory cytokine production and
oxidative stress, thereby impairing vascular endothelial func-
tion, which also contributes to increased CVD risk (6–8).
Nuts contain many bioactive compounds with cardiometa-
bolic benefits. Epidemiologic evidence from 3 large cohort
studies (total n = 206,029) showed that nut and peanut
consumption was inversely associated with total mortality (9).
In the Nurses� Health Study, the consumption of peanuts
$2 times/wk led to a 34% reduction in relative risk of coronary
artery disease (10). Peanuts are a popular snack in the United
States and a source of unsaturated FAs, plant protein, and bioactive
compounds (resveratrol, arginine, vitamin E, magnesium, fiber,
and other antioxidants) (11, 12). Moderate [1–1.5 ounces/d
(28–42 g/d)] consumption of peanuts has been shown to improve
glucose metabolism (13, 14) and the blood lipid and lipoprotein
profile (15), with no increase in body weight (16). A recent clinical
study in obese men showed that acute consumption of conven-
tional peanuts and high-oleic peanuts (56 g, providing 25% of
total energy) attenuated postprandial inflammatory and insulin
responses compared with a control meal with no peanuts (17).
The cardioprotective effects of nuts are also thought to be
achieved by maintaining endothelial function. Endothelial dys-
function is a precursor for atherosclerosis and an independent
predictor of cardiac events (18). Endothelial dysfunction can limit
the production and/or availability of NO, leading to impaired
vasodilation (18). A previous study reported that the consumption
of an ad libitum diet that included 56 g (366 kcal) walnuts/d for
8 wk improved endothelial function measured by flow-mediated
dilatation (FMD) compared with a control diet without walnuts
in individuals with type 2 diabetes (change in FMD: 2.2% 6
1.7% compared with 1.2% 6 1.6%; P = 0.04) (19). In a
randomized crossover trial, FMD improved in hypercholesterol-
emic subjects after 4 wk of consumption of walnuts (contributing
32% of total energy) compared with a Mediterranean-type
control diet without walnuts (change in FMD: 5.9% 6 3.3%
compared with 3.6% 6 3.3%; P = 0.04) (20).
Postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperlipemia can initiate a
cascade of biochemical events that lead to endothelial dysfunction
(21). With the evidence we have to date that peanuts improve
postprandial glucose (22, 23), lipid (17), and inflammatory (17)
responses, it is possible that acute peanut consumption may
improve vascular responses. However, there is limited evidence
about whether peanut consumption affects postprandial vascular
function. Therefore, in the present study we evaluated the effect
of acute peanut consumption as part of a high-fat meal on
postprandial vascular function, plasma glucose, insulin, and
lipid and lipoprotein profiles. We hypothesized that acute peanut
consumption would result in an improved lipid and lipoprotein
profile and vascular function as assessed by FMD, a commonly
used noninvasive assessment of vascular endothelial function.
Methods
Participants. We recruited generally healthy, overweight or obese [BMI
(in kg/m2) 28–39] men (to avoid hormone cycle effects on vascular
function in women) between 20 and 65 y of age, with fasting TGs
<350 mg/dL, LDL cholesterol <160 mg/dL, glucose <99 mg/dL, and
blood pressure #140/90 mm Hg. Participants were free of diabetes,
CVD, kidney disease, and other metabolic diseases. The study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of The Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity and carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration
(clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01405300).
Study design. A randomized crossover trial was conducted. Partici-
pants were evaluated on 2 occasions separated by a washout period of a
minimum of 7 d between interventions. Participants were randomly
assigned to consume the control or peanut shake during visit 1 and the
alternate shake was consumed during visit 2. On each occasion, fasting
(10–12 h) blood samples were collected at baseline (t = 0 min) and then
at 30, 60, 120, and 240 min after the ingestion of either a control shake
or a peanut shake (consumed within 15 min). Participants were asked
not to consume alcohol 48 h before the blood draw and to avoid
vigorous exercise 2 h before the blood draw. FMD and blood pressure
were measured at baseline (t = 0 min) and at 240 min.
Nutrient profile and composition of the peanut and control
shakes. The nutrient profile of the test shakes is presented in Table 1.
The control and peanut shakes were matched for macronutrient content.
The control shake provided 24.8% carbohydrate, 64.7% fat (27.6% SFAs,

 26.0% MUFAs, 11.1% PUFAs), 8.4% protein, 8.2 g fiber, and 1229 kcal.
The peanut shake provided 25.9% carbohydrate, 66.2% fat (28.2%
SFAs, 26.7 MUFAs, 11.3% PUFAs), 8.5% protein, 8.2 g fiber, and 1198 kcal.
The ingredient composition of the test shakes is presented in Table 1.
Sunflower oil, safflower oil, powdered egg white, and fiber were used in
the control shake to match the nutrient profile of 3 ounces (85 g) of
peanuts. The amount of whipping cream and glucose in the peanut and
control shakes was adjusted to ensure that all shakes were matched for
carbohydrate and SFA contents. The control shake provided 34.8 g
glucose, 150 g heavy whipping cream, 39 g chocolate syrup, 20 g
sunflower oil, 17 g safflower oil, 27 g powered egg white, and 9.6 g fiber
supplement (Benefiber; Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.). The peanut
shake provided 34.8 g glucose, 137 g heavy whipping cream, 39 g
chocolate syrup, and 85 g (3.0 ounces) ground peanuts with skins.
Ingredients were blended with 150 g water and 60 g crushed ice in a
Vitamix blender (Vita-Mix Corporation).
Blood sampling. A flexible catheter was inserted in the antecubital vein
of the left arm, and blood samples were collected into evacuated tubes.
Blood samples were collected in the fasted state (0 min) and at 30,
60,120, and 240 min after consumption of the test meals. Serum samples
were sent to Quest Diagnostics (Chem 24 panel; Quest Diagnostics) for
analysis. Lipids and lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, and C-reactive protein
were assayed at all time points.
FMD. Participants were asked to lie down for 15 min before the FMD
assessment. Endothelial function was assessed by FMD with high-frequency
ultrasound in a quiet, temperature-controlled room (21–24�C). Longitudi-
nal images of the brachial artery 5–10 cm above the elbow of the right arm
were acquired with external B mode ultrasound imaging (Acuson Aspen
128XP equipped with a 10-mHz linear array transducer; Acuson) and
recorded during the following procedure: baseline (1 min), arterial
occlusion (5 min) via inflation of a cuff on the forearm (distal to the
segment being imaged) set at 250 mm Hg (Hokanson), and reactive
hyperemia (2 min). Images were graded by using R-wave detection so that
scans were assessed at the end of diastole. Two independent, blinded
technicians used automated edge detection software (Brachial Analyzer;
MIA) to quantify artery diameter continuously throughout the test. Resting
diameters were the average of all images collected over the 1-min baseline
period. Peak artery diameter was determined as the largest diameter
recorded in the 2-min reactive hyperemia segment. The reported FMD
score was calculated as the percentage change from resting arterial diameter
to peak reactive hyperemia diameter. Scores presented are the average of the
2 technicians� scores.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis was performed by using SAS
(version 9.2; SAS Institute). The mixed-models procedure (PROC
MIXED) was used to test the effects of treatment, time, and treatment
by time interactions on each outcome. Subject was included as a random
effect, and the remaining factors were fixed effects. Tukey-Kramer–
adjusted P values were used for post hoc comparisons. The 4-h
incremental AUC (iAUC) of postprandial concentrations of TGs,
glucose, and insulin were analyzed by using a mixed model with
treatment as a fixed effect. Changes were calculated by using values from
the 240-min time point minus the baseline value (0 min).
As part of a secondary analysis, we categorized participants into 2 groups
on the basis of their baseline total cholesterol (TC) concentration at
150 mg/dL (mean of baseline TC) and baseline LDL-cholesterol concentra-
tion at 100 mg/dL (optimal LDL-cholesterol concentration: #100 mg/dL).
For this stratification, we determined baseline concentrations to be the
value taken at 0 min on the first day of testing. Baseline lipid
concentrations were added as a categorical variable to the mixed
model as a fixed effect to determine whether participants initially
presenting with elevated cholesterol responded differently to peanut and
control meals than did participants with lower baseline cholesterol
concentrations. Means are reported as least-squares means 6 SEMs. A
histogram and residual plots were used to verify normality of data. The
study sample size was estimated with power set to 0.90 and a set to 0.05,
which predicted a sample size of 15 participants to detect a 1% change in
FMD (24).

 Results
Participants and baseline characteristics. Fifteen nonsmok-
ing male participants met all of the inclusion criteria and
completed the study. None of the enrolled participants withdrew
from the study. Participant baseline characteristics are presented
in Table 2. In the present study, 40% of participants were
overweight and 60% were obese.
Postprandial insulin, glucose, and lipids. Postprandial
glucose, insulin, lipid, and lipoprotein concentrations in re-
sponse to the test meals are presented in Table 3. A mixed
linear model showed a treatment by time interaction for
TGs (P < 0.0001). Both control and peanut meals increased
postprandial TGs after 60 min of ingestion compared with
baseline (P < 0.05 for both treatments). Peak TG responses to the
2 treatments were observed at 120 and 240 min (P < 0.05 for
both treatments compared with baseline). At these time points,
postprandial changes in plasma TG concentrations were greater
(P = 0.033) after the control meal than after the peanut meal
(Figure 1). The postprandial changes in plasma TG concentra-
tions were also calculated as iAUCs. There was a 31.9%
reduction in the TG iAUC after consumption of the peanut meal
compared with the control meal (P = 0.047).
The TG-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio was used as a surrogate
marker for insulin resistance (25). At 120 and 240 min, there
was a trend for an increased TG-to-HDL-cholesterol ratio in
response to the control meal compared with the peanut
meal (P = 0.09). There were no treatment, time, or treatment-
by-time interactions for TC, LDL cholesterol, or HDL choles-
terol. As expected, glucose and insulin increased immediately
after shake consumption (effect of time, P < 0.001), but no
difference between treatments was observed.
Endothelial function. The control shake significantly reduced
FMD by 1.2% at 240 min postconsumption compared with
baseline (P = 0.029). There were no significant differences in
FMD between baseline and 240 min postconsumption of the
peanut shake (Figure 2). Baseline (0 min) cholesterol concen-
tration predicted change in FMD. Participants with higher
baseline TC concentrations (>150.0 mg/dL; n = 9) showed a
significant decrease in FMD (21.8%; P = 0.017) 240 min after
consumption of the control meal compared with baseline (Figure
3A). In contrast, FMD in response to the peanut meal remained
unchanged in participants with both lower and higher baseline
TC concentrations. Similar results were observed in participants
with a higher baseline LDL-cholesterol concentration. Partici-
pants (n = 6) with a higher baseline LDL-cholesterol concentra-
tion (>100 mg/dL) showed a significant decrease in FMD
(22.0%; P = 0.038) 240 min after the control meal (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, the peanut meal did not decrease FMD compared
with baseline in participants, irrespective of baseline LDL
cholesterol concentration.
Discussion
In the present study, we assessed the effects of peanut
consumption on metabolic responses and endothelial function in
generally healthy overweight or obese men. Acute peanut
consumption attenuated postprandial TG responses (31.9%
reduction in TG iAUC) compared with a calorie and
macronutrient-matched control meal. We showed that acute
consumption of 3.0 ounces of peanuts as part of a high-fat meal
preserved postprandial endothelial function, particularly in
participants with unfavorable baseline lipid profiles. In addition,
these findings suggest that the inclusion of peanuts in the context
of a high-fat meal may have favorable postprandial cardiome-
tabolic effects.
Most individuals spend the majority of their nonsleeping
hours in a postprandial state. Postprandial lipemia, a well-
recognized risk factor for atherosclerosis, is associated with
impaired endothelial function. During the postprandial period,
an increase in TG-rich lipoproteins after a high-fat load
increases oxidative stress. This resulting reduced NO bioavail-
ability leads to endothelial dysfunction, which is indicated by a
suppressed FMD response (26). Previous studies have shown
that increases in postprandial TG-rich lipoproteins after a high-
fat meal temporarily impair endothelial function in young (23 6
2 y) participants (27, 28). In the present study, the consumption
of a high-fat control meal significantly decreased endothelial
function, whereas it was maintained after the consumption of a
macronutrient-matched meal with peanuts, and was accompa-
nied by a blunted postprandial TG response. These findings
suggest that peanut consumption preserves endothelial function
in the presence of postprandial TG-rich lipoprotein increases,
which may be related to a reduction in oxidative stress. We hasten

 to add that other mechanisms may be involved in mediating this
effect, and additional research is needed to clarify this.
This cardioprotective effect may be due to the bioactive
compounds in peanuts and peanut skins. For example, NO is an
important vasodilator that is synthesized from L-arginine in
endothelial cells (29). Peanuts are a rich source of L-arginine,
which reflects their high protein content (25% of total energy)
(30). Dietary L-arginine could enhance NO synthesis and protect
the endothelium against postprandial oxidative damage. Marchesi
et al. (24) reported that 10-d administration of a low-dose of
L-arginine (6 g/d) attenuated postprandial endothelial dysfunc-
tion in young healthy men. Oral L-arginine supplementation
(7 g, 3 times/d for 4 wk) improved endothelial dysfunction
in hypercholesterolemic young adults (31). In our study, 85 g
peanuts were provided to the participants, which provided
2.74 g L-arginine.
In addition to
L-arginine, other bioactive compounds in
peanuts may offer other cardioprotective effects. Wien et al. (32)
reported that the daily consumption of peanuts (46 g/d) over
24 wk improved the nutrient profile of the diet (increased unsat-
urated fat, a-tocopherol, niacin, and magnesium) and reduced
body weight in participants with type 2 diabetes. Each kilogram
of weight loss was associated with a 0.11-mmol/L reduction in
fasting blood glucose and a 0.07% reduction in glycated
hemoglobin (32). Moreover, peanuts (including peanut skins)
are a source of phenolic compounds that have high antioxidant
capacity, which may prevent endothelial damage by blunting
postprandial oxidative reactions associated with a high-fat meal.
The phenolic compounds in peanuts and nuts may also contribute
to an anti-inflammatory postprandial response (33). There is
evidence that postprandial inflammation and oxidative stress can
exaggerate postprandial lipemia, which leads to vascular dysfunc-
tion and damage (34). Moreira Alves et al. (17) reported that acute
consumption of 56 g peanuts (with skins) significantly reduced the
postprandial inflammatory biomarkers TNF-a and IL-10 3 h after
consumption in overweight men. Thus, the bioactive compounds
in peanuts may attenuate inflammation and the resulting oxidative
stress (caused by meals high in SFAs), thereby benefiting endothe-
lial health, especially in the postprandial state.
The role of antioxidants and L-arginine in improving FMD and
the lipid and lipoprotein profile has been investigated in other
nuts. Ros et al. (20) reported that the consumption of a walnut
diet (18% of total energy) for 4 wk attenuated endothelial
dysfunction in individuals with hypercholesterolemia. Acute
consumption of a walnut meal (90 g walnuts) increased
postprandial g-tocopherol and resulted in a lower concentration
of malondialdehyde postprandially, suggesting less lipid perox-
idation (35). Hudthagosol et al. (36) reported that, after
consumption of a pecan test meal (90 g pecans), concentrations
of g-tocopherol doubled and oxidized LDL decreased by 26% at
8 h. Collectively, the findings of these studies indicate that
bioactive constituents in nuts contribute to postprandial anti-
oxidant defenses. Although walnuts are the most-studied nuts
relative to the evaluation of vascular reactivity, other nuts and
peanuts would be expected to have similar benefits.
In the present study, we performed a stratification analysis
on the basis of participants� baseline lipid and lipoprotein profile.
Participants with higher baseline cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations are more prone to endothelial dysfunction after a high-
fat meal. We have shown that peanut consumption maintained vascular
function in participants who were at greater cardiometabolic
risk on the basis of their lipid and lipoprotein profile.
This robust study design directly compared peanut consump-
tion with the consumption of a macronutrient-matched control
meal without peanuts. Thus, we were able to evaluate the
contribution of the bioactive components in peanuts. In addi-
tion, the postprandial design allowed us to characterize the
metabolic time course of the endpoints we assessed after peanut
consumption. A limitation of this study is the small sample size
(n = 15). The results from the present study need to be verified
in a larger sample that includes both women and men. In
addition, the fat content of the test meal may have been greater
than the typical fat content of a Western diet, which may limit
the generalizability of the study results. However, it is not
uncommon that milkshakes that are high in calories are
consumed in the context of a high-fat meal. The use of shakes
as a delivery vehicle may somewhat represent the unhealthy diet
pattern that may contribute to the postprandial hyperlipidemia
responses that have deleterious effects on endothelial function.
Postprandial effects also may be more apparent in individuals
with diabetes who have impaired glycemic control.
In conclusion, the acute consumption of 3.0 ounces (85 g) of
peanuts as a part of a high-fat meal reduced the postprandial TG
response and maintained endothelial function in overweight and
obese men, particularly in those who were at greater cardiome-
tabolic risk due to elevated baseline TC and LDL-cholesterol
concentrations. Therefore, frequent consumption of peanuts

dial cardiometabolic responses, including those that affect
vascular function.
