SUMMARY
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is heteroge-
neous in the genetic and environmental parameters
that influence cell metabolism in culture. Here, we as-
sessed the impact of these factors on human NSCLC
metabolism in vivo using intraoperative 13C-glucose
infusions in nine NSCLC patients to compare meta-
bolism between tumors and benign lung. While
enhanced glycolysis and glucose oxidation were
common among these tumors, we observed evi-
dence for oxidation of multiple nutrients in each of
them, including lactate as a potential carbon source.
Moreover,
metabolically
heterogeneous
regions
were identified within and between tumors, and sur-
prisingly, our data suggested potential contributions
of non-glucose nutrients in well-perfused tumor
areas. Our findings not only demonstrate the hetero-
geneity in tumor metabolism in vivo but also highlight
the strong influence of the microenvironment on this
feature.
INTRODUCTION
Tumors display altered metabolism relative to benign tissues (Ha-
nahan and Weinberg, 2011). These changes support abnormal
survival and growth of malignant cells by providing energy,
macromolecular precursors, and reducing equivalents (DeBerar-
dinis et al., 2008). Beyond the importance of metabolic reprog-
ramming to cancer biology, it also has implications for clinical
oncology. Targeting key metabolic activities is an effective ther-
apeutic approach (Vander Heiden, 2011), and the ability to image
informative aspects of metabolism has made it possible to iden-
tify and characterize malignant tissue non-invasively. The most
widely used form of metabolic imaging is 18fluoro-2-deoxyglu-
cose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), which capital-
izes on enhanced glucose uptake in tumors (Fletcher et al., 2008).
Metabolic gene expression and metabolomics have been
used to identify subclasses among individual human tumors
from the same organ (Caro et al., 2012; Terunuma et al., 2014),
but it is unknown whether these differences reflect true changes
in metabolic activity in vivo. Tumor metabolism is regulated by a
poorly defined combination of cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic
factors. Oncogene expression is sufficient to reprogram some
aspects of nutrient utilization, suggesting that cell-autonomous
metabolism is driven in part by the oncogenotype (Gao et al.,
2009; Ji et al., 2007; Son et al., 2013). Altered perfusion from
abnormal tumor vasculature is believed to be a major extrinsic
driver of metabolism through effects on oxygen and substrate
delivery (Guillaumond et al., 2013). Other extrinsic effects include
metabolic competition or cooperativity among stromal, immune,
and tumor cells (Pavlides et al., 2009; Sonveaux et al., 2008).
A full accounting of tumor metabolism will need to consider
extrinsic influences in addition to the complexity imposed by
the oncogenotype.
The tumor microenvironment is difficult to model ex vivo, and
this limits the use of culture-based systems to infer the meta-
bolism of intact tumors. Stable isotopes (e.g., 13C) are widely
used to investigate cellular metabolism, because patterns of
13C enrichment downstream of a labeled nutrient encode infor-
mation about pathway activity (Buescher et al., 2015). The safety
of 13C makes this approach feasible in humans. A few studies
have provided 13C-labeled nutrients to cancer patients during
tumor resection, then analyzed 13C enrichment in metabolites
extracted from the tumor. In gliomas and brain metastases, infu-
sions of [U-13C]glucose revealed metabolism of glucose through
both glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (T) cycle (Maher et al.,
2012). In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), introducing [U-13C]

 glucose as a bolus revealed that both glycolysis and TCA cycle
metabolism were active in the tumor (Fan et al., 2009). Pyruvate
carboxylase (PC), the enzyme converting pyruvate to oxaloace-
tate (OAA), was highly expressed in NSCLC and contributed to
labeling differences between tumor and lung (Sellers et al.,
2015).
None of these reports assessed heterogeneity within or
between tumors or the influence of cell-extrinsic factors on
metabolism. Here, we incorporated clinical imaging to provide
quantitative information about glucose metabolism and the
tumor environment in NSCLC from nine untreated patients. We
demonstrate that these tumors are heterogeneous with respect
to glucose utilization and that areas of metabolic heterogeneity
between and within tumors can be predicted by assessing tissue
perfusion preoperatively.
RESULTS
Workflow for Preoperative Imaging, Intraoperative
13C-Glucose Infusion, and Sample Selection
Prior to surgery, tumors were assessed by FDG-PET and multi-
parametric MRI (mpMRI) (Figure 1A). mpMRI consisted of T2-
weighted imaging for anatomy; diffusion-weighted imaging
(DWI) to determine the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), a
surrogate for cellularity; and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
(DCE-MRI), which measures time-dependent entry of a contrast
agent and is used to assess perfusion (Koh and Collins, 2007;
Yankeelov and Gore, 2009). Multidisciplinary conferences
involving the research team, surgeon, and radiologist were
held to discuss the images and plan tissue sampling. On the
day of surgery, the patient had an intravenous catheter placed
into each arm. One was used to deliver 8-g [U-13C]glucose
over 10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 8 g/hr for an
average of 3 hr until the lobectomy was performed. The other
was used to withdraw blood samples for analysis of 13C enrich-
ment in plasma glucose. This approach achieves a persistent
state of high enrichment of plasma glucose (Maher et al.,
2012). After removal of the lobe, the tissue was oriented to iden-
tify anatomic landmarks and dissected to procure specific frag-
ments prioritized by presurgical imaging. The fragments were
rinsed, frozen, and subjected to histological, molecular, and
metabolic analysis.
Imaging and 13C data from a 59-year-old female smoker with a
grade 3 adenocarcinoma (patient 1) are in Figures 1B–1E. This
tumor exceeded 22 cm3 and was FDG-PET avid, demonstrating
heterogeneous FDG signal and SUVmax > 10 (Figure 1B; Table 1).
Plasma glucose enrichment exceeded 30% for 2 hr (Figure 1C).
Histology revealed the tumor to have abundant staining for
Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation, and CD31, a marker of tumor
vasculature (Figure 1D). Metabolites were extracted from lung
and from an FDG-avid, ADC-low (i.e., highly cellular) tumor
fragment. For an intuitive display of how 13C labeling compared
between the tumor and lung, average relative fractional enrich-
ments (i.e., fractional enrichment in tumor/fractional enrichment
in lung) are shown for several metabolites. Glucose and the
glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) had some-
what lower fractional enrichments in the tumor, but all other
glucose-derived metabolites, including lactate and TCA-cycle-
derived intermediates (citrate, glutamate, and malate), were
more enriched in the tumor (Figure 1E; full 13C distributions are
shown in Figure S1). Thus, in this tumor, high FDG uptake corre-
lated with enhanced contribution of glucose to lactate and TCA
cycle intermediates.
Comparison of Bolus and Continuous Infusions of
[U-13C]Glucose Administration
Administering 13C glucose as one or more boluses rather than a
continuous infusion has been used to assess tumor metabolism
in humans and mice (Fan et al., 2009; Sellers et al., 2015; Yuneva
et al., 2012). Boluses have the advantage of reduced cost and
ease of administration. On the other hand, infusions may lead
to improved 13C signal, better evaluation of complex pathways
requiring persistent
13C exposure, and the possibility of
achieving isotopic steady state to simplify analysis (Marin-Valen-
cia et al., 2012). Analysis of the TCA cycle is complicated by the
fact that labeling depends not only on the route of entry but also
on the number of times the cycle has turned. To compare these
methods, we assessed labeling data obtained from brief versus
prolonged periods of 13C exposure. Patient 2 received an 8-g
bolus of [U-13C]glucose, followed shortly thereafter by resection.
This produced a rapid rise in glucose enrichment, but no plateau
in the circulation (Figure S2A). Patient 3 received an 8-g bolus
prior to anesthesia followed by another 8-g bolus 1 hr before sur-
gery (Figure S2B). As in patient 1, enrichments in lactate (M+3)
and TCA cycle intermediates (M+2 citrate, glutamate, and ma-
late) were higher in the tumor than the lung of patients 2 and 3
(Figure S2C). The relative enrichment of these species was not
improved by patient 1’s longer infusion, but the absolute enrich-
ments were lower in patients 2 and 3, resulting in poor signal for
higher-order labeling (e.g., M+3-4 in citrate and malate; Figures
S2D and S2E). M+1 isotopologues were also better represented
after persistent 13C glucose exposure; this form of labeling likely

 arises after multiple turns of the TCA cycle (Figures S2F and 2G).
Thus, boluses are sufficient to detect abundant isotopologues
but compromise assessment of other isotopologues. For these
reasons, we used infusions in patients 4–9.
Enhanced Anaerobic and Aerobic Glucose Metabolism
in NSCLC
Table 1 and Figure S3 contain clinical and histological informa-
tion from the nine patients. The tumors were heterogeneous in
their tumor-lymph-nodes metastasis (TNM) stage, grade, and
SUVmax. Molecular analysis of EGFR and KRAS revealed EGFR
mutations in four patients and KRAS mutations in two; three
tumors did not contain mutations in either gene. The tumors
also displayed a wide range of stromal content, microvessel den-
sity, and MIB-1 fraction (Table 1). Plasma glucose enrichments
showed the expected rapid rise in 13C fractional enrichment
due to the bolus, followed by a plateau during the infusion (Fig-
ure S4). Complete 13C isotopologues from all tissue fragments
are in Table S1. Relative fractional enrichments are shown for
several informative metabolites (averages in Figure 2A and
data from individual fragments in Figure 2B). All lung samples
demonstrated enrichment of intermediates from glycolysis and
the TCA cycle, indicating that benign lung uses both pathways
(Table S1). These intermediates were also labeled in all tumors.
Importantly, although there was substantial variability in 13C la-
beling, the variability among patients far exceeded the variability
among independent samples obtained from the same tumor,
indicating that this technique detects biological variation in hu-
man tumor metabolism (Figure 2C).
Despite the fact that all tumors displayed FDG uptake by PET,
glucose fractional enrichment was lower on average in tumor
than lung, as previously reported (Fan et al., 2009). Lactate, by
contrast, was more enriched in tumor fragments, indicating a
greater propensity to convert [U-13C]glucose to [U-13C]lactate
than non-cancerous lung. Several metabolites related to the
TCA cycle (e.g., M+2 isotopologues of acetyl-CoA, citrate, gluta-
mate, and malate) were also more enriched in the tumors (Fig-
ures 2A and 2B).
Although these M+2 enrichments likely reflect entry of label
into the TCA cycle via the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) reac-
tion, mass spectrometry (MS) does not provide positional 13C
information. This potentially confounds the interpretation of qual-
itative assessment of MS isotopologues, particularly when the
overall enrichment is low. M+2 isotopologues in citrate, etc.,
may therefore reflect PDH-dependent labeling during the first
turn of the cycle, multiple turns of the cycle, or the combined
effects of PC-dependent entry and multiple turns. To limit the as-
sumptions needed to interpret the data, we analyzed several
fragments by 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectros-
copy, which definitively assigns 13C positions. These spectra
revealed prominent 4–5 doublets in carbon 4 of glutamate, a
pattern requiring PDH activity. This doublet was much more
prominent in tumor than lung (Figures 3A and S5A), and labeling
of the 4–5 doublets relative to the C4 singlet was highly corre-
lated with fractional enrichments of M+2 in citrate and glutamate
(Figure 3B). These observations indicate that enhanced TCA
cycle labeling in tumors reflects entry of uniformly labeled
acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) into the cycle via PDH. Strong
correlations between mass isotopologues lactate M+3 and cit-
rate M+2, and between citrate M+2 and malate M+2, indicate
that glycolysis, PDH, and TCA cycle activity are linked in the tu-
mors (Figure 3C). To rule out artificial inflation of 13C labeling by
metabolite pool depletion (Buescher et al., 2015), we also
analyzed metabolite abundance. Glucose was less abundant in
the tumors, lactate was more abundant, and TCA cycle interme-
diates displayed no consistent trend (Figures S5B and S5C).
Thus, human NSCLC tumors display enhanced carbon flow
through PDH and the TCA cycle compared to adjacent lung.
Lung tumors contain increased expression of PC and have
evidence of enhanced flux through this anaplerotic enzyme as as-
sessed by qualitative assessment of 13C enrichment (Sellers et al.,
2015). PC converts [U-13C]pyruvate into OAA M+3, which can

 condense with unlabeled acetyl-CoA to produce citrate M+3 and
equilibrate with malate to produce malate M+3. Fractional enrich-
ments of malate, citrate and glutamate M+3 were higher in tumor
than lung (Figure 3D), although the absolute abundance of these
species was much lower than PDH-derived isotopologues (Table
S1). Citrate M+5, the condensation product of OAA M+3 and
acetyl-CoA M+2, was barely detectable, likely because of the
low absolute enrichment in OAA and acetyl-CoA. TCA cycle turn-
over was assessed by analyzing the fractional enrichment of cit-
rate M+1 and malate M+1, both of which were over-represented
in the tumors (Figure 3E). Therefore, the prominence of M+2 isoto-
pologues is not an artifact of reduced cycle turnover.
To extend the analysis beyond qualitative assessment, we
used tcaSIM, a computational tool that simulates metabolic
networks involving glycolysis, the TCA cycle, fatty acid oxida-
tion, anaplerosis, and other activities. The utility of this tool is
enhancedby the higherand more complex labelingdataprovided
by steady state rather than bolusinfusions. tcaSIM can be used to
identify relative fluxes that best account for experimental labeling
data derived from multiple metabolites simultaneously. This
approach avoids pitfalls associated with simple qualitative anal-
ysis, such as the possibility that enhanced 13C labeling in TCA
cycle intermediates arises from high enrichment in upstream me-
tabolites rather than bona fide flux changes. Modeling indicated
that both PC and PDH fluxes, relative to citrate synthase flux
used as a reference, were elevated in the tumors. PDH rather
than PC dominated pyruvate entry into the TCA cycle in both
tumor and normal lung (Figure 3F). The magnitude of PDH flux
was positively correlated with the MIB-1 fraction (Figure S5D).
Evidence for Lactate Utilization by NSCLC Tumors in
Humans and Mice
Although acetyl-CoA enrichment was higher in tumors than lung
(Figure 2A), the absolute enrichment was low (Figure 4A). This
prompted us to examine whether other blood-borne metabolites
contribute to tumor metabolism. Lactate circulates at levels of
1–2 mM and is a fuel for cancer cells under some conditions
(Guillaumond et al., 2013; Kennedy et al., 2013; Sonveaux
et al., 2008). To examine the impact of circulating lactate on
tumor metabolism, we first compared fractional enrichments
between lactate and the glycolytic intermediates 3-PG and
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in tumor and lung from all patients.
In lung fragments, 3-PG and PEP enrichments were similar to
lactate enrichment, and the average ratio of lactate M+3 to
3-PG or PEP M+3 was almost exactly 1.0 (Figure 4B). This is ex-
pected if lactate arises from glycolysis in the lung. In contrast,
lactate enrichment in many tumor fragments exceeded 3PG or
PEP enrichment (Table S1), and the average lactate M+3 ex-
ceeded 3-PG or PEP M+3 by �40% (Figure 4B). Excess labeling
was also propagated into the TCA cycle, as the ratio of enrich-
ment of citrate M+2 to 3-PG or PEP M+3 was higher in tumors
(Figure 4B). These findings implied that additional labeled sub-
strates contributed to tumor lactate. The most obvious candi-
date was lactate itself, because lactate imported from the
plasma would feed the tumor lactate pool and could provide
carbon to the TCA cycle (Figure 4C). Indeed, [U-13C]glucose
infusion led to measurable amounts of circulating [U-13C]lactate
(Figure 4D; Table S1). Because plasma lactate enrichments were

 lower than glucose enrichments in both the plasma and tumor,
metabolism of 13C-lactate in the tumor would dilute enrichment
in acetyl-CoA and other metabolites relative to tumor glucose
enrichment. Given our confirmation by NMR that M+2 isotopo-
logues primarily reflect entry and passage of [U-13C]acetyl-
CoA through the TCA cycle, if the fractional M+2 enrichment of
TCA cycle intermediates exceeded M+3 in 3-PG and PEP, this
would be consistent with contribution of lactate to TCA cycle
metabolism. This relationship was observed in several patients,
including patient 1 (Figure 4E; Table S1). Others, like patient 5,
demonstrated a pattern of progressive decline in labeling from
glucose to all downstream intermediates, similar to the lung (Fig-
ure 4E). These data suggest that some human lung tumors may
use lactate as a carbon source.
To examine lactate metabolism directly, mice bearing subcu-
taneous xenografts derived from cell lines bearing mutations in
KRAS (A549 cells, G12S mutation) or EGFR (HCC827 cells,
E746-A750 deletion) were infused with [2-13C]lactate. This led
to rapid and persistent enrichment of the circulating lactate
pool (Figure 4G), and some enrichment in glucose as lactate
was used as a gluconeogenic precursor (Figure 4F). Lactate
within these tumors was significantly labeled (Figure 4G). Enrich-
ment in citrate, malate, and glutamate exceeded enrichment of
3-PG, indicating that these metabolites contained 13C from im-
ported lactate rather than from labeled glucose.
Individual NSCLC Tumors Display Heterogeneous
Degrees of Glucose Metabolism Predicted by an MRI
Marker of Perfusion
The extensive metabolic heterogeneity among tumors prompted
an examination of factors regulating glucose metabolism. The
availability of DCE-MRI data in all patients provided an opportu-
nity to examine the influence of perfusion on tumor metabolism.
We first assessed mean signal intensity of DCE images by manu-
ally drawing a region of interest (ROI) of a slice chosen for
maximal tumor diameter. Tumors were easily dichotomized by
qualitative DCE assessment, with several displaying higher
time-dependent contrast enhancement and the rest displaying
lower enhancement (Figure 5A). DCE data were also analyzed
as the initial area under the curve 60 s after contrast administra-
tion (iAUC60; Figure 5B). This parameter was previously demon-
strated to be stable in human NSCLC over at least 1 week (Ng
et al., 2010), similar to the period of time between imaging and
resection in our patients (1–8 days). Analysis of fractional enrich-
ment revealed that metabolites from well-perfused tumors were
nearly indistinguishable from adjacent lung, whereas tumors with
low iAUC60 values had, on average, higher enrichments
compared to either benign lung or tumors with high iAUC60
values (Figure 5C). Modeling 13C enrichment data showed that
PDH flux was approximately three times higher in tumors with
low-contrast enhancement, whereas PC flux was no different
between the groups (Figure 5D).
To test whether regions of metabolic heterogeneity existed
within individual tumors, we used DCE-MRI to identify anatomic
regions of differential contrast enhancement, then selected
regions of high and low contrast uptake from the same tumor
for metabolite extraction and 13C enrichment analysis. Patient
8 was a non-smoker with an EGFR-mutated adenocarcinoma
measuring 16.1 cm3 and a high SUVmax (Figure 5E; Table 1).
Although analysis of DCE-MRI of the tumor as a whole identified
this as a well-perfused mass (Figure 5A), DCE characteristics
were dramatically different between the superior and inferior
regions (Figure 5E). Fragments obtained from the superior and
inferior aspects were sectioned into three smaller fragments,
extracted, and analyzed for 13C enrichment. Enrichments in the
less well-perfused inferior aspect of the tumor were significantly
higher than those in the superior aspect (Figure 5F). Both
NMR spectroscopy and modeling of mass spectrometry data
confirmed differential metabolism in these two areas of the tumor
(Figure S6). Patient 9 had a 3.8-cm3 adenocarcinoma with a low
SUVmax (Table 1) and relatively poor DCE signal throughout (Fig-
ure 5A). However, subtle differences were detected, indicating
modestly enhanced signal in the posterior compared to the
medial region (Figures S7A and S7B). As in patient 8’s larger
and more FDG-avid tumor, fragments isolated from these two
regions displayed differences in 13C enrichment, with the region
of higher DCE signal demonstrating small reductions in 13C
enrichment of lactate, citrate, and other metabolites (Figure S7C).
Thus, DCE-based assessment of perfusion predicts the extent of
glucose’s contribution to central metabolism across a clinically
relevant range of perfusion and SUVmax.
To generate more insight into the relationship between DCE
phenotypes and metabolism, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was
performed on fragments from several tumors. The fragments
were then clustered according to their gene expression signa-
tures, using all detected transcripts or a subset of 2,756 genes
related to metabolism (Figure 6A) (Possemato et al., 2011). In
neither of these unsupervised analyses did the fragments segre-
gate according to the perfusion phenotype. However, gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed enhanced expression of
genes related to glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and the
TCA cycle in fragments with low DCE signal, whereas fragments
with high DCE signal were enriched for genes related to other nu-
trients, with many of the 20 most-enriched gene sets related to
the lysosome and amino acid metabolism (Figures 6B and 6C).
Thus, areas of differential DCE signal display altered patterns
of gene expression and altered utilization of glucose-derived
carbon to supply central metabolism.
DISCUSSION
Here, we coupled [U-13C]glucose infusions with FDG-PET and
mpMRI to assess glucose fates in NSCLC, compare metabolism
to adjacent lung, and identify aspects of tumor biology that

to analyze human tumor metabolism with isotope tracers. In
particular, two previous studies used a bolus of 13C-glucose
prior to resection to assess NSCLC metabolism (Fan et al.,

 concluded that enhanced pyruvate carboxylation differentiates
NSCLC from lung. Our work adds to these studies in several
ways. First, we report the molecular and histological character-
istics of tumors in the study. This allowed us to demonstrate
that enhanced glucose oxidation is observed across diverse
histological subtypes and oncogenotypes. Second, we applied
a computational assessment of glucose metabolism after persis-
tent exposure to a continuous source of isotope in the circula-
tion. Ultimately, this provided information about both carbon
entry into and processing by the TCA cycle, as well as an assess-
ment of the extent to which glucose and other fuels supply oxida-
tive metabolism. Third, integrating multimodality imaging with
13C-derived data allowed us to compare metabolic markers
with other biological features, particularly tissue perfusion.
Because these features are suspected to influence metabolism,
our approach provides information about the drivers of meta-
bolic complexity in human NSCLC.
Several practicalities of these human studies bear mention.
The surgical procedure requires ligation of the pulmonary artery
for 15–30 min prior to resection of the diseased lobe. During this
time, the lobe and tumor depend on bronchial and collateral
circulation for nutrient delivery. Evidence indicates that this did
not significantly alter oxygenation of the tumor. The bronchial cir-
culation carries highly oxygenated blood and accounts for a
greater contribution to total NSCLC blood flow than the pulmo-
nary circulation (Nguyen-Kim et al., 2015). Inspection of 13C la-
beling indicated hallmarks of enhanced rather than suppressed
TCA cycle metabolism, arguing against severe oxygen limitation.
These markers persisted even in the occasional patient (not
shown) in which the ligation lasted for several hours. Thus,
although total blood flow was likely reduced by pulmonary artery
ligation, this did not prevent the tissue from engaging in oxidative
metabolism.
A technical limitation is that the method requires fragments
large enough for 13C studies (�50 mg), inevitably leading to a
mixture of malignant and stromal cells. We used presurgical im-
aging and gross inspection of the tumor to choose fragments
composed primarily of viable, malignant cells and histology to
confirm this. Although individual tumors contained variable con-
tributions of non-malignant cells, the consistency of key features
across the cohort (e.g., enhanced labeling of TCA cycle interme-
diates) strongly implies that these features are consequences of
the malignant cells. Also, some aspects of the modeling assume
homogeneity within each fragment with respect to glucose
metabolism. Although it is unknown to what extent stromal cells
impact metabolic homogeneity within the fragment, we note that
the qualitative assessment of labeling and the modeled acetyl-
CoA enrichment agreed very well with each other.
Despite these complexities, it was possible to draw several
conclusions. First, the data strongly suggest that glycolysis
and glucose oxidation via PDH and the TCA cycle are enhanced
in NSCLC relative to adjacent benign lung. We observed this
phenotype in tumors with mutations in either EGFR or KRAS
and presumably in other oncogenic drivers not detected by our
molecular analysis. The effect of specific oncogenic mutations
is unclear from the current cohort. Although the two KRAS
mutant tumors had high levels of 13C labeling, both also had
low DCE signal, which independently predicted high 13C labeling
across the entire group. The overall impression is that multiple
oncogenic drivers can specify a phenotype of robust glucose
oxidation in vivo. This is consistent with the observation that
enhanced glucose metabolism is a shared consequence of
many tumorigenic mutations in cultured cancer cells. However,
the relationship between glycolysis and glucose oxidation in
live tumors has been difficult to ascertain. A common perception
is that avid 18FDG uptake implies enhanced glycolysis and sup-
pressed glucose oxidation, analogous to the conventional un-
derstanding of the Warburg effect (Warburg, 1956). Our data
provide strong evidence against the concept of a ‘‘switch’’
from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism in NSCLC. Several
tumors in the study had SUVmax values exceeding 10, yet there
was no evidence of suppressed glucose oxidation. We conclude
that enhanced glucose uptake in
18FDG-PET-positive lung
tumors supplies enhanced glucose oxidation. Increasing the
cohort size will make it possible to test whether particular muta-
tions elicit specific effects on glucose metabolism.
Second, entry of 13C into the TCA cycle was dominated by
PDH. PDH-dependent labeling of TCA cycle metabolites was
observed in all tumors and was enhanced on average relative
to benign lung. Most cancer cell lines also use PDH to supply
carbon from glucose to the TCA cycle, although this enzyme is
dispensable for survival and proliferation when other nutrients
are available in culture (Rajagopalan et al., 2015). In our cohort,
PDH activity correlated with Ki67 staining, suggesting that
PDH functions in proliferating malignant cells. PDH was also
recently shown to be required for tumor cell survival and/or
growth in a KRAS-driven mouse model of lung cancer, arguing
that this enzyme is crucial for cancer cells in the lung microenvi-
ronment (Davidson et al., 2016).
Third, the tumors displayed low enrichment in acetyl-CoA rela-
tive to glucose. This likely indicates that additional substrates
enter the metabolic network between glucose and the TCA
cycle. Although glucose is a prominent energy source, emerging
evidence indicates that tumor cells oxidize other nutrients as
well, and in some circumstances may prefer alternative fuels to
glucose (Boroughs and DeBerardinis, 2015; Mashimo et al.,
2014). Other potential carbon sources include fatty acids, amino
acids, ketones, and macromolecules scavenged from the extra-
cellular space. Our data suggest that lactate, typically viewed as
a waste product of cancer cells, can be used as a respiratory
substrate by NSCLC tissue. Lactate is abundant and is taken
up by monocarboxylate transporters, several of which are

 expressed in NSCLC (Eilertsen et al., 2014). Lactate dehydro-
genases (LDHs) catalyze NAD+/NADH-dependent exchanges
between lactate and pyruvate. Although all LDH isoforms cata-
lyze this reaction in both directions, isoforms containing B sub-
units encoded by LDHB may favor conversion of lactate to
pyruvate and are highly expressed in tissues that use lactate
as a fuel. LDHB is highly expressed in a subset of NSCLC tumors
and cell lines and correlates with poor survival in adenocarci-
noma (McCleland et al., 2013). It has been proposed that lactate
is used as a respiratory substrate in well-perfused areas of solid
tumors, with less perfused areas of the same tumors converting
glucose to lactate and secreting it (Sonveaux et al., 2008). Our
data do not document net lactate consumption and do not
discriminate regional localization of lactate oxidation. However,
we do observe that, on average, the contribution of substrates
other than [U-13C]glucose to the TCA cycle was accentuated in
regions of high DCE signal. The data suggest a role for PET
probes based on lactate and other fuels to help define nutrient
preferences in human NSCLC and determine their regulation
by the oncogenotype, the microenvironment, and other factors.
Fourth, a key finding was that the metabolic variability among
tumors could be predicted by DCE. Tumors with high DCE signal
were similar to normal lung in terms of 13C enrichment, while
tumors with lower signal had enhancements of essentially all iso-
topologues related to the TCA cycle via either PDH or PC. This
implies that the predominant metabolic phenotype observed in
human NSCLC (enhanced 13C labeling of TCA cycle intermedi-
ates) is related to perfusion. It is unclear whether altered perfu-
sion dictates metabolic activity or whether reduced perfusion
and altered metabolism occur in parallel downstream of other
factors. In support of the former hypothesis, when considered
in light of the low tumor acetyl-CoA enrichment and RNA-seq
data, the relationship between 13C enrichment and DCE sug-
gests that perfusion alters the contributions of various fuels to
the TCA cycle (Figure 6D). Specifically, high-DCE tumors may
oxidize multiple substrates simultaneously, but if perfusion
becomes compromised in low-DCE tumors, the contribution of
glucose to the TCA cycle rises relative to competing substrates.
This may simply reflect the fact that glucose exceeds fat and pro-
tein in terms of energy produced per unit of oxygen consumed
and may be preferable in states of modestly reduced perfusion.
An alternative, but not mutually exclusive, possibility is that less
abundant nutrients become depleted in areas of reduced perfu-
sion, whereas glucose remains available by virtue of its high con-
centration and diffusivity. A similar hypothesis was proposed to
explain how interactions between tumor cells and the microenvi-
ronment favor a glucose-avid phenotype (Gatenby and Gillies,
2004). In this setting, enhanced glucose metabolism may be
required to provide energy and synthetic precursors to offset
reduced availability of other fuels and macromolecules from
the circulation.
We capitalized on the excellent spatial resolution of DCE-MRI
to perform regional analysis within individual tumors. This pro-
duced evidence of regional heterogeneity of metabolic flux in
solid tumors. Notably, the data suggest that the influence of
perfusion may override the intrinsic metabolic preferences set
by the genetics of the tumor. For example, patient 8’s tumor
contained an L858R mutation in EGFR, yet metabolic activity
varied considerably across the tumor in correlation with the
DCE phenotype. A key emerging question is whether metabolic
vulnerabilities also display such striking regional heterogeneity
within individual tumors. This would have major implications for
the prospects of metabolic therapy in cancer.
In summary, we report the power and practicality of combining
clinical imaging and 13C enrichment in human cancer. Our data
suggest that tumor metabolism is significantly and predictably
regulated by the microenvironment and that local alterations of
metabolism can be identified prior to surgery. This technique
enables a rational approach to sample procurement. Given the
ever-expanding repertoire of context-specific metabolic path-
ways in cancer cells (Boroughs and DeBerardinis, 2015), this
method should greatly increase the information yield of experi-
ments involving isotope tracers. It should now be possible to
identify and preselect regions using alternative substrates to
supply the TCA cycle and to test specific hypotheses related
to interactions between the microenvironment and metabolic
preferences. Because DCE and other acquisition methods of
mpMRI are suitable for mouse models of cancer, it will also be
possible to use this approach in experimental systems where
the cost of infusions is low and control of experimental parame-
ters is high.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Additional detail is in Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Clinical Protocol
Nine patients with untreated NSCLC were enrolled in an IRB protocol after
obtaining informed consent. On the day of surgery, [U-13C]glucose was
introduced as described previously (Maher et al., 2012). Standard surgical pro-
cedures were followed, with the majority of cases being robotic lobectomies.
Tissue fragments were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Histological ana-
lyses were conducted by pathologists blinded to the metabolic results. Exons
18-21 of EGFR were bi-directionally Sanger sequenced using lab-developed
primers. Mutation analysis for KRAS codons 12, 13, 61, and 146 was per-
formed on a Sequenom Mass ARRAY system (MALDI-TOF) with manual
calling.
Multi-parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging
MRIs occurred 8 or fewer days before surgery. Coronal and axial T2-weighted
images were used to localize the lesion and acquire measurements. DCE and
DWI were performed within the same examination.
Mass Spectrometry and NMR Spectroscopy
Blood obtained during infusions was used to measure plasma glucose enrich-
ment as described previously (Maher et al., 2012). Tissue samples (50–100 mg)
were added to 50:50 methanol:water for extraction. Gas chromatography
(GC)-MS and NMR were performed as described previously (Cheng et al.,
2011; Maher et al., 2012).
Mouse Studies
All procedures were approved by UT Southwestern’s Animal Care and Use
Committee in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals. One million A549 or HCC827 cells were injected into the flanks of
Ncr nude mice. Before infusions, mice were fasted for 16 hr, then 27G cathe-
ters were placed in the lateral tail vein under anesthesia. A 10% wt:wt aqueous
solution of [2-13C]lactate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) was infused via sy-
ringe pump for 120 min at a rate of 150 ml over 10 min and 2 ml/min until the end
of the infusion. Blood samples of �50 ml were obtained periodically. Animals
were euthanized at the end of the infusion, then tumors were harvested, rinsed
briefly in cold saline, and frozen in liquid nitrogen.

 RNA Sequencing
Tumor samples were homogenized, and RNA was extracted. 3 mg RNA was
processed for library preparation and sequencing. Raw reads were aligned
to human genome assembly hg19. A set of 2,756 human metabolic genes
(Possemato et al., 2011) was used for GSEA to define differentially expressed
pathways between samples with high or low DCE signal.
Statistics
Patient-matched samples were analyzed by paired Student’s t test. Inter-tu-
mor analysis of contrast enhancement and relative fractional enrichments
was analyzed by unpaired Student’s t tests. Correlation plots were analyzed
with Pearson’s product-moment correlation coefficients of the trendlines. All
data were considered significant if p < 0.05.
