ith the introduction of modern cross-sectional 
imaging techniques such as multi–detector row 
computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance 
(MR) imaging to postmortem investigations, forensic 
pathology has taken an important step forward (1,2). 
Relatively low maintenance costs, short examination 
times, and ease of operation make CT a widely used 
cross-sectional imaging technique in modern postmor-
tem imaging (3). Compared with conventional autop-
sy, postmortem CT has several advantages, which can 
lead to important improvements in both research and 
postmortem investigation (4–8). The main reported 
weakness of postmortem CT, however, is relatively 
low soft-tissue contrast, especially in organ parenchy-
ma, and poor ability to view the vascular system (8). 
 
Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of unexpected nat-
ural death in most developed countries (9), and this limi-
tation decreases the potential of postmortem CT to help 
 
diagnose cardiovascular disease. Consequently, the ref-
erence standard for investigation of natural death, and 
particularly cardiovascular death, is considered to be 
conventional autopsy (2–5,7).
In clinical radiology, these limitations are addressed 
with the use of intravenous contrast agents. Consequently, 
various postmortem angiographic techniques have been 
developed (10–19). Probably the most widespread single 
approach for postmortem angiography today is multiphase 
postmortem CT angiography (20–27), first described in 
2011 (14). This technique uses a standardized procedure 
on the basis of a defined injection and a scanning proto-
col that uses a specific perfusion device and an oil-based 
contrast agent of specific viscosity. A previous study (8) 
revealed that the addition of postmortem CT angiography 
to postmortem CT increased the sensitivity for detecting 
pathologic findings from 64% to approximately 81%, 
which is comparable to the sensitivity of conventional au-
topsy (~83%). Because this study was conducted in only 
one center of forensic medicine and thus it involved a small 
number of human corpses, the technical working group 
for postmortem angiography methods decided in 2012

Purpose: To determine if postmortem computed tomography (CT) and postmortem CT angiography help to detect more lesions 
than autopsy in postmortem examinations, to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and to define their indications.
Materials and Methods: Postmortem CT angiography was performed on 500 human corpses and followed by conventional autopsy. 
Nine centers were involved. All CT images were read by an experienced team including one forensic pathologist and one radiolo-
gist, blinded to the autopsy results. All findings were recorded for each method and categorized by anatomic structure (bone, organ 
parenchyma, soft tissue, and vascular) and relative importance in the forensic case (essential, useful, and unimportant).
Results: Among 18 654 findings, autopsies helped to identify 61.3% (11 433 of 18 654), postmortem CT helped to identify 76.0% 
(14 179 of 18 654), and postmortem CT angiography helped to identify 89.9% (16 780 of 18 654; P , .001). Postmortem CT angi-
ography was superior to autopsy, especially at helping to identify essential skeletal lesions (96.1% [625 of 650] vs 65.4% [425 of 650], 
respectively; P , .001) and vascular lesions (93.5% [938 of 1003] vs 65.3% [655 of 1003], respectively; P , .001). Among the foren-
sically essential findings, 23.4% (1029 of 4393) were not detected at autopsy, while only 9.7% (428 of 4393) were missed at postmor-
tem CT angiography (P , .001). The best results were obtained when postmortem CT angiography was combined with autopsy.
Conclusion: Postmortem CT and postmortem CT angiography and autopsy each detect important lesions not detected by the other 
method. More lesions were identified by combining postmortem CT angiography and autopsy, which may increase the quality of 
postmortem diagnosis.

to initiate a multicenter study with the goal of validating the 
technique of multiphase postmortem CT angiography on a large 
number of cases.
The purpose of this study was to determine if postmortem CT 
and postmortem CT angiography help to detect more lesions than 
autopsy in postmortem examinations, to evaluate the strengths 
and weaknesses of each method, and to define their indications.
Materials and Methods
Study Design
The study was a prospective multicenter study. Nine European 
centers participated and acquired data from unenhanced post-
mortem CT, postmortem CT angiography, and conventional au-
topsy on 500 human corpses in which an autopsy was ordered. 
The study was conducted from February 2012 to August 2015. 
Inclusion criteria were as follows: subject age older than 16 years, 
the performance of all three examinations in accordance with the 
standardized protocol for every case, and a fully recorded data set.
This study was partially funded by a private company 
 
(Fumedica AG, Muri, Switzerland). The funding included travel 
expenses, cost of tubing sets and contrast agent, rental for a 
 
Virtangio device for the duration of the study (for centers in 
Foggia, Italy; Krakow, Poland; Leipzig and Munich, Germany; 
Toulouse, France; Leicester, England; and Basel, Switzerland).
Study Preparation
Where required, the approval of local ethics committees was 
obtained (depending on the country or previously existing 
agreements) in accordance with local legislation. The examina-
tions from England additionally received consent from the next 
of kin. Training in postmortem CT angiography was provided 
in a preparation phase by the principal investigator’s center to 
each attending center, including at least 1 week of training in 
the performance of postmortem CT angiography.
Data Acquisition
CT images were acquired according to standardized scanning 
protocols adapted to the equipment at each center. An overview 
of the CT parameters is as follows: section thickness, 0.75–3 
mm; spacing interval, 0.6–2 mm; field of view, 414–500 mm; 
tub voltage, 110–130 mm; tube current, 100–380 mA; and 
standard algorithm of reconstruction. Details are provided in Ta-
ble E1 (online). Postmortem CT angiography was performed by 
using the standardized protocol described by Grabherr et al (14). 
This included the application of specific single-use sets for fem-
oral vascular cannulation and the injection of a contrast agent 
Summary
If autopsy had been performed without postmortem CT, 39% of all 
findings and 23% of essential findings would not have been reported.
Implications for Patient Care
 
n Postmortem CT angiography is superior to autopsy and CT with-
out angiography to help detect forensically essential findings.
 
n The combination of autopsy and multiphase CT angiography 
helps to reveals most findings.

mixture of an oil-based solution of defined viscosity (mixture of 
paraffin oil [paraffinum liquidum] with 6% oil-based contrast 
agent [Angiofil; Fumedica, Muri, Switzerland]) by using a spe-
cial perfusion device (Virtangio; Fumedica, Muri, Switzerland) 
and the standardized injection protocol, including an arterial, 
venous, and dynamic phase of injection.
Conventional forensic autopsy was performed on each body 
by the forensic pathologists in charge of the case in accordance 
with local and European requirements and standards (examina-
tion of the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities) (28). These 
experts were informed of the most important radiologic findings 
before the autopsy was performed, which enabled them to ad-
equately adapt their autopsy technique except in England, where 
autopsy was performed according to Royal College of Pathologists 
guidelines (29) independent of the radiologic results. A complete 
autopsy report was provided by the lead forensic pathologists.
Data Registration and Analysis
A team from the coordinating study center evaluated the data 
from the included cases (S.G., a board-certified forensic patholo-
gist with 10 years of experience interpreting radiologic data, par-
ticularly postmortem CT angiography data; J.M.G., a board-certi-
fied radiologist with 5 years of experience reading postmortem CT 
and postmortem CT angiography data; and P
.M., K.M., and C.P
., 
all board-certified forensic pathologists with 15–30 years of expe-
rience in the field and fluent in the local language of the visited 
center). The first two team members read the radiologic images of 
the included bodies (postmortem CT and postmortem CT angi-
ography) and entered every pathologic finding into a spreadsheet. 
The second forensic pathologist extracted all pathologic findings 
reported by the local forensic pathologists from the autopsy re-
port. All findings described at postmortem CT, postmortem CT 
angiography, and autopsy were then entered in a spreadsheet (Ex-
cel; Microsoft, Redmond, Wash) together with background case 
information (ie, age, sex, and circumstances of death).
Regarding the circumstances of death, we grouped cases into 
four groups on the basis of the cause of death and the indication of 
the postmortem examination: natural death (eg, cardiovascular in-
cident and sepsis); polytrauma (severe multisystem injury such as

fall from great height or traffic accident); other 
violent death (localized injuries such as ballistic 
trauma, sharp force trauma, and blunt force 
trauma); and suspected medical error (death 
during or shortly after a medical intervention 
in which a postmortem examination was per-
formed to prove or rule out a medical error).
The different findings were jointly classified 
by two board-certified forensic pathologists 
from the coordinating study center (S.G. and 
either K.M., P
.M., or C.P
.) into three groups 
(essential, useful, or unimportant) on the basis 
of their importance to the forensic investiga-
tion of the case, such as their contribution to-
ward identifying the cause of death, the events 
that led up to the death, and reconstruction 
of the forensic background. For example, in a 
cardiac death, coronary plaques, stenoses, and 
the associated myocardial infarction would be 
considered essential; other vascular pathologic 
analyses would be considered useful; and an 
old appendectomy or hip prosthesis would be 
considered unimportant. Findings were also 
categorized anatomically as bone, soft tissue 
(including muscles, tendons, connective and 
fatty tissue, and the skin), parenchyma (paren-
chymatous organs, intestines, and the heart), 
and vascular (calcification, stenosis, occlusion, 
aneurysm, and rupture of vessels including the 
coronary arteries).
Findings of additional examinations and 
analyses before or after imaging and/or au-
topsy (most importantly external examina-
tion, histologic analysis, and toxicology analy-
sis) were not considered in this study because 
they can be performed independently or com-
bined with both conventional autopsy and 
modern imaging methods.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by 
using statistical software (MedCalc ver-
sion 15.6.1, MedCalc Software, Ostend, 
Belgium; and SPSS version 25, IBM, Ar-
monk, NY). Postmortem CT, postmortem 
CT angiography, and autopsy results were 
compared by using Cochran Q test. The re-
quired difference between groups for pair-
wise comparisons was determined accord-
ing to Sheskin if Cochran Q test showed 
a statistically significant result (30). Val-
ues presented in the text were additionally 
evaluated with McNemar test by using the 
simple sampling bias corrected accelerated 
bootstrap method with 1000 samples. A P 
value of less than .05 was considered to in-
dicate statistical significance.

imaging with autopsy. Autopsy findings as a percentage of all findings are in red. Additional find-
ings not observed at autopsy but identified at postmortem CT are in blue. Green indicates findings 
undiscovered at both autopsy and postmortem CT but detected at postmortem CT angiography. 
There is a relatively high effect of postmortem CT in polytrauma evaluation and of postmortem 
CT angiography in medical errors and natural death. (b) Additional findings obtained by using 
angiography with postmortem CT, and then by performing an autopsy. Postmortem CT findings 
as a percentage of all findings are in blue. Additional findings detected by using postmortem CT 
angiography are in green. Finally, findings only detected at autopsy are in red. Notice the rela-
tively high effect of autopsy in medical errors and natural death, and the low effect in evaluation of 
polytrauma.
postmortem CT angiography helped to detect 84.6% (11 of 13; 
P . .05) and 90.0% (45 of 50; P , .05), respectively. This supe-
riority was less pronounced for essential vascular lesions (autopsy 
Results
Autopsy was performed on the day of 
the postmortem CT and postmortem 
CT angiography examination, or the fol-
lowing day, in all cases. The maximum 
interval between death and autopsy was 
5 days. After examination of 500 bodies, 
a total of 18 654 findings were recorded. 
Demographic data are in Table 1. Results 
of the comparisons between postmortem 
CT, postmortem CT angiography, and 
autopsy are in Table 2. Further details re-
garding the stratification of results across 
sites and for different manners of death 
can be found in Tables E2 and E3 (on-
line). Diagrams that display the cumula-
tive advantage of autopsy, postmortem 
CT, and post 
mortem CT angiography 
are in Figure 1.
When viewed in conjunction, the 
diagrams show that about a quarter to a 
fifth of the essential and useful findings 
is missed at autopsy. When postmortem 
CT is performed in addition to autopsy, 
the proportion of missed findings is re-
duced to about 10%. Roughly the same 
amount and quality of information is 
delivered by combining postmortem CT 
and postmortem CT angiography. The 
best results are achieved when autopsy 
is combined with postmortem CT and 
postmortem CT angiography, especially 
in cases of natural death and malpractice.
The greatest advantage of postmortem 
CT or postmortem CT angiography over 
autopsy was observed for the detection of 
bone and vascular lesions for any manner 
of death (Table 2). For both essential find-
ings and all findings, only 9.7% (428 of 
4393) and 10.0% (1874 of 18 654), re-
spectively (P , .001), would have been 
overlooked if postmortem CT angiogra-
phy had been performed without autopsy. 
If autopsy had been performed without 
postmortem CT or postmortem CT an-
giography, 38.7% of all findings (7221 of 
18 654) and 23.4% of essential findings 
(1029 of 4393) would not have been re-
ported (P , .001). If only postmortem 
CT had been performed, 24.0% of all 
findings (4475 of 18 654) and 37.5% of 
essential findings (1647 of 4393) would 
have remained unreported (P , .001).
In cases of natural death (Table 
E3a [online]), only about half of the essential bone lesions 
(53.8%; seven of 13) and two-thirds of essential soft tissue le-
sions (64.0%; 32 of 50) were detected at autopsy, whereas

CT is therefore most notable when vascular pathologic changes 
are prevalent.
As expected, postmortem CT angiography resulted in ad-
ditional findings compared with postmortem CT. The greatest 
number of additional essential findings were registered in cases of 
natural death and medical errors (Fig 3) and the majority of find-
ings were categorized as vascular and parenchyma, for which post-
mortem CT angiography is especially sensitive. The cases in which 
postmortem CT angiography showed bone lesions that were not 
detected at postmortem CT (eight examinations) can be explained 
by bone contusions or compression fractures with visible contrast 
agent extravasation but no morphologic fracture signs.
Our results also confirm the superior detection of bone lesions 
with postmortem CT compared with autopsy, whereas its detec-
tion rate for essential parenchyma, soft-tissue, and vascular lesions 
was significantly lower. The greatest number of findings in cases 
of natural death and suspected medical errors were missed at post-
mortem CT, in which half or more of the essential findings were 
missed. In both of these groups, the majority of pathologic find-
ings were categorized as vascular or parenchymal, in which unen-
hanced CT is less sensitive. Interestingly, the overall detection rate 
vs postmortem CT angiography, 79.3% 
[472 of 595] vs 90.8% [540 of 595], re-
spectively; P , .001) whereas more essen-
tial parenchyma lesions were detected at 
autopsy (autopsy vs postmortem CT an-
giography, 85.9% [593 of 690] vs 81.0% 
[559 of 690], respectively; P , .05).
In cases of violent death (Table E3b 
[online]), more than half of the essential 
vascular findings were missed at autopsy 
(60.9%; 95 of 156). At postmortem 
CT, 87.8% (137 of 156) of essential 
vascular findings were missed, whereas 
less than 1% (one of 156) were missed 
at postmortem CT angiography (all P 
, .001). However, autopsy showed a 
slightly higher detection rate for essen-
tial soft-tissue lesions versus postmortem 
CT angiography (90.2% [642 of 712] vs 
88.6% [631 of 712], respectively), which 
was not statistically significant.
In cases of polytrauma (Table E3c 
[online]), more than two-thirds of essen-
tial vascular lesions were not detected at 
autopsy (68.6%; 81 of 118). Only 5.9% 
of these (seven of 118) were detected at 
postmortem CT, whereas all were de-
tected at postmortem CT angiography 
(all P , .001). Both postmortem CT 
and postmortem CT angiography per-
formed better for the detection of essen-
tial bone and parenchyma findings (P , 
.005); however, for essential soft-tissue 
lesions, postmortem CT angiography 
performed better than autopsy (P , 
.01). The difference with postmortem 
CT was not statistically significant.
In cases of suspected medical error (Table E3d [online]), 
93.3% (125 of 134) of essential vascular lesions were detected 
at postmortem CT angiography. However, slightly less than a 
third (30.6%; 41 of 134) and two-thirds (63.4%; 85 of 134) of 
essential vascular lesions were detected at postmortem CT and 
autopsy, respectively (all P , .001).
Discussion
Our results show that postmortem CT angiography is superior to 
autopsy for all findings except essential soft-tissue findings. The 
superiority of imaging over autopsy for the total and essential find-
ings is strongly influenced by the significantly higher detection 
rates for bone and vascular lesions that together make up more 
than half of the findings. An example of a bone lesion, clearly vis-
ible at CT but not identifiable in autopsy, is shown in Figure 2. 
 
Whereas the bone lesions are already visible on the CT image, the 
vascular findings are rendered visible at CT angiography. Many 
of those vascular findings were not even visible in conventional 
autopsy, especially if small vessels were concerned. The advantage 
of postmortem CT angiography over autopsy and postmortem

tilage (box in a) of a 27-year-old woman who died of strangulation. Three-dimensional volume-

Postmortem CT scan learly displays a displaced bilateral fracture of the cricoid cartilage (arrows). 
This finding is important because it proves the application of relevant force to the neck. It was dif-
ficult to demonstrate this finding at autopsy because anatomic preparation required extensive ma-
nipulation of the laryngotracheal region, which without postmortem CT would have been unclear 
regarding whether the fracture was caused by the preparation or was there before autopsy.

of soft-tissue lesions was slightly higher at 
postmortem CT than it was at autopsy. 
However, this superiority is on the basis of 
useful and unimportant findings, whereas 
for essential soft-tissue findings autopsy 
was superior to postmortem CT. This 
result may be explained by the sensitivity 
of postmortem CT to pathologic changes 
in the subcutaneous fat. These lesions are 
less frequently detected or described at au-
topsy and only rarely considered essential.
Although these results should be in-
terpreted with caution, they show that 
a number of essential findings are not 
detected at autopsy, especially bone and 
vascular lesions. This confirms the results 
of previous studies (14), and is also in 
line with our professional experience. 
In some cases, the interpretation of the 
autopsy results regarding the cause of 
death and events leading to death would 
have been incomplete or simply wrong 
if postmortem CT and postmortem CT 
angiography had not been performed.
We do not know if any potential find-
ings were missed despite the use of both 
postmortem CT angiography and au-
topsy, and if they were missed, we do not 
know how many. However, even though 
we were unable to test postmortem CT 
angiography and autopsy against an in-
dependent reference standard (because 
none exists), our results show that the 
combination of postmortem CT angiog-
raphy and autopsy is clearly superior to 
autopsy alone.
There has been concern in many coun-
tries about declining autopsy rates over re-
cent decades. A high-quality postmortem 
examination is important not only in fo-
rensic cases, but also for the evaluation of 
the quality of clinical diagnosis and therapy 
in clinical pathologic analysis. It is thus an important instrument 
for both justice and medical quality control. The importance of 
both aspects cannot be overestimated. Postmortem CT and post-
mortem CT angiography might be feasible ways to increase the 
number of high quality postmortem examinations.
An efficient postmortem examination should be performed in 
a stepwise manner, beginning with a thorough external examina-
tion of the body and the circumstances of death. The next step 
would be to perform postmortem CT, which may be sufficient 
to confirm a suspected cause and manner of death. Even if the re-
sults are inconclusive, it acts as a triage tool because findings from 
postmortem CT help to determine whether autopsy, postmortem 
CT angiography, targeted histologic analysis, or any combination 
would be best to help ascertain the cause and manner of death. If 
used in this way, postmortem CT would in many cases shorten the 
length of postmortem examinations and reduce the effort required 
to perform them. The more time-consuming and more expensive 
techniques of postmortem CT angiography, autopsy, and histo-
logic analysis would be reserved for ambiguous postmortem CT 
results. The number of high-quality postmortem examinations 
could be increased relatively easily to counter declining autopsy 
rates and the overall quality of postmortem examinations would 
increase.
Our study has limitations. In some institutes that participated 
in this study, postmortem CT and postmortem CT angiogra-
phy were routine practice as a means of informing the autopsy. 
Therefore, in these examinations it was not possible to blind the 
forensic pathologists who performed the autopsy to the imaging 
results for both legal and ethical reasons. As a result, we expect that 
some findings were reported at autopsy that might otherwise have 
Figure 3: (a) Postmortem CT and (b–d) and 
arterial phase postmortem CT angiography 
images in a 59-year-old woman who died of 
internal exsanguination shortly after Whipple 
surgery. (a) A large left-sided hemothorax with 
mediastinal shift to the right. During the surgery, 
supraceliac clamping of the abdominal aorta 
was performed to stop intraperitoneal bleeding. The clamp was later loosened but left in place (ar-
row in b). The fatal hemothorax was caused by hemorrhage from the left 11th intercostal artery, 
which was torn near its origin from the aorta just above the diaphragm during placement of the 
clamp. The contrast media extravasation from the artery’s origin, reaching cranially into the thorax 
(arrows in b, c, and d), is displayed on arterial phase postmortem CT angiographic images (c and 
d). This finding may have been difficult to detect at autopsy because of the small size and location 
of the vessel. In this case it could not be displayed at autopsy because of large amounts of intraper-
itoneal and intrathoracic clotted blood, and multiple previous abdominal operations with extensive 
scar tissue formation and adhesions.

remained undetected, improving the apparent diagnostic ability 
of autopsy. Because we were unable to use a double-blind study 
design, we could not assess the accuracy of the final diagnosis of 
the cause of death. For the same reason, the sensitivity and speci-
ficity of the applied methods were not calculated because the value 
would not be sufficiently objective. Therefore, only the lesion de-
tection rate was used for comparisons. This can be interpreted as 
sensitivity if the combination of autopsy with postmortem CT 
or postmortem CT angiography is considered the ground truth.
The study design enabled us to evaluate organ-specific findings, 
which can be identified by using different techniques. It did not 
focus on the advantages and limitations for specific case groups. 
Further studies focused on particular demands (eg, cardiovascular 
deaths, deaths in childhood, and deaths related to gunshots) and 
anatomic regions (eg, cardiac and cerebral) are required.
Our study leads to several important conclusions. A number 
of important findings remain unreported when postmortem CT, 
postmortem CT angiography, or autopsy are not considered in 
conjunction with each other. Indeed, postmortem CT angiogra-
phy detects a greater number of important findings than autopsy, 
especially vascular and bone findings; it is therefore the method of 
choice for vascular findings. For parenchyma and soft-tissue find-
ings, small differences are shown at autopsy and postmortem CT 
angiography, but postmortem CT alone is inferior. By combining 
autopsy and CT angiography, the reported number of findings 
can be increased, leading to a better postmortem examination. If 
only imaging or autopsy can be applied, the choice depends on the 
investigated case and the suspected findings.
