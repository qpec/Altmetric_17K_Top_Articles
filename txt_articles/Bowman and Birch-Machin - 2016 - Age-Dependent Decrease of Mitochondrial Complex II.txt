 Age-Dependent Decrease of
Mitochondrial Complex II Activity
in Human Skin Fibroblasts
Amy Bowman1 and Mark A. Birch-Machin1
The mitochondrial theory of aging remains one of the most widely accepted aging theories and implicates
mitochondrial electron transport chain dysfunction with subsequent increasing free radical generation.
Recently, complex II of the electron transport chain appears to be more important than previously thought in
this process, suggested predominantly by nonhuman studies. We investigated the relationship between
complex II and aging using human skin as a model tissue. The rate of complex II activity per unit of mito-
chondria was determined in fibroblasts and keratinocytes cultured from skin covering a wide age range.
Complex II activity significantly decreased with age in fibroblasts (P ¼ 0.015) but not in keratinocytes. This
was associated with a significant decline in transcript expression (P ¼ 0.008 and P ¼ 0.001) and protein levels
(P ¼ 0.0006 and P ¼ 0.005) of the succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit A and subunit B catalytic subunits
of complex II, respectively. In addition, there was a significant decrease in complex II activity with age
(P ¼ 0.029) that was specific to senescent skin cells. There was no decrease in complex IV activity with
increasing age, suggesting possible locality to complex II.

INTRODUCTION
It was first speculated more than 40 years ago that mito-
chondria play a key role in the aging process (Harman, 1972),
mainly because the majority of endogenous reactive oxygen
species (ROS) are produced by these dynamic organelles as a
byproduct of respiration. In addition, higher levels of mito-
chondrial dysfunction, mitochondrial DNA damage, and
ROS generation are observed with increasing age (Birket and
Birch-Machin, 2007; Boffoli et al., 1994; Capel et al., 2005;
Hayakawa et al., 1992; Koziel et al., 2011; Short et al., 2005).
However, the exact role of mitochondria in the aging process
remains unknown.
Mitochondrial complex II is the least studied of the five
mitochondrial complexes of the electron transport chain. It
is the smallest complex, composed of only four succinate
dehydrogenase complex subunits A through D (SDHA,
SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD), and is entirely nuclear encoded.
Recent observations have implicated a possible role for this
complex in the aging process. It has been demonstrated that
complex II can generate ROS to a similar extent as complexes
I and III in mitochondria isolated from rat skeletal muscle
(Quinlan et al., 2012) and may play a role in ROS production
in human skin cells (Anderson et al., 2014). It was also
recently observed that complex II activity is lower in the skin
of naturally aged mice compared to younger mice (Velarde
et al., 2012). Other work implicating a role for complex
II in the aging process include studies showing that mutations
in the subunits of complex II can result in accelerated aging
in animals. For example, SDHC and SDHB mutations
accelerate aging and decrease lifespan in Caenorhabditis
elegans (Adachi et al., 1998; Hosokawa et al., 1994; Huang
and Lemire, 2009; Ishii et al., 1998; Pfeiffer et al., 2011) and
Drosophila melanogaster (Tsuda et al., 2007; Walker et al.,
2006). In addition, complex II activity has been shown to
decrease with increasing age in human muscle (Boffoli et al.,
1994; Short et al., 2005). However, the activity of complex II
with age in human skin has not been investigated previously
and was therefore chosen to be examined in this study. Skin is
the largest organ of the body, acting as a barrier to external
insults such as ultraviolet radiation, infection, toxicity, and
mechanical stress (Haake et al., 2001). It is therefore highly
important to understand the aging process in this organ, not
only to allow maintenance of dermatological health but as an
organ that can be accessed and studied easily, with the
findings from skin research having profound relevance and
application to aging in other body tissues.
As well as investigating complex II in terms of biological
aging, we looked at this complex in terms of cellular senes-
cence. Whereas biological aging describes the functional
decline of a whole organism over time leading to an increase
in susceptibility to disease and eventually death, cellular
senescence describes the transformation of cells from a
proliferating to a nonproliferating state as a tumor suppressive
mechanism to prevent cells with potentially cancerous DNA

 mutations from undergoing replication (Campisi and d’Adda
di Fagagna, 2007). Senescent cells release ROS (Nelson et al.,
2012; Passos et al., 2010), with the number of senescent cells
increasing with age (Campisi, 2005). Complex II has recently
been linked to the process of senescence, whereby mice with
mitochondrial superoxide dismutase knocked out were
shown to have increased ROS production, higher levels of
nuclear DNA damage, decreased complex II activity, accel-
erated aging, and increased senescence levels in the skin,
with no change in the other mitochondrial complex studied
(complex IV) (Velarde et al., 2012). In addition to investi-
gating the relationship between complex II and aging in
human skin (activity and transcript expression/protein levels),
we chose to determine whether differences in complex II are
evident in senescent cells from older individuals compared
to senescent cells from younger individuals. The findings
implicate the potential involvement of complex II in both
cellular senescence and in the overall aging process. Human
in vivo data from future studies are required to determine
whether this decline in complex II activity with increasing
age has a functional relevance in skin and other tissues.
RESULTS
Complex II activity decreases with age in human
skin fibroblasts
Complex II activity was measured in fibroblasts cultured from
the skin of 27 donors, ranging in age from 6 to 72 years, from
a sun-protected region of skin in order to determine whether
this specific mitochondrial complex shows a difference in
activity
with
increasing
age.
Complex
II
activity
was
measured using spectrophotometry, with the results normal-
ized to citrate synthase activity, which is a common mito-
chondrial marker used to determine mitochondrial amount
(Birch-Machin and Turnbull, 2001) to allow complex II ac-
tivity per unit of mitochondria to be determined complex II
activity per unit of citrate synthase activity (CII/CS). It was
found
that
CII/CS
activity decreased significantly
with
increasing age in skin fibroblasts (P ¼ 0.015, rho ¼ e0.461;
Figure 1a). To determine whether this decrease in complex II
activity with age was specific to skin fibroblasts or was also
present in another skin cell type, CII/CS activity was deter-
mined in skin keratinocytes from 19 donors of differing ages.
The skin keratinocytes did not show a significant change in
complex II activity with age (P ¼ 0.726, rho ¼ e0.086;
Figure 1b), suggesting that the decrease in complex II activity
with age was specific to fibroblasts in the skin.
Complex II activity is approximately twofold higher
in fibroblasts than in keratinocytes
Interestingly, it was noted that CII/CS activity was approxi-
mately twofold higher in the fibroblasts compared to the
keratinocytes in this study (P < 0.0001; Figure 1c, i). This was
also confirmed to be the case in dermal and epidermal tissue
when compared directly after tissue grinding (P ¼ 0.0006;
Figure 1c, ii), which excludes any possible interference
caused by the different media and culture conditions of the
fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Because of the observed
decrease in complex II activity in skin fibroblasts with age
and their high overall activity, these cells were chosen to be
studied further in order to determine the cause of this
decrease in complex II activity with age.
Complex IV activity does not change with age in human
skin fibroblasts

mitochondrial

 mitochondrial complex, an additional complex was exam-
ined. Complex IV was chosen to be used as a control because
this complex is not directly linked to complex II at the
electron transport chain via the ubiquinone pool, unlike
complexes I and III. Complex IV was measured in 18 fibro-
blast cell samples cultured from human skin from the same
individuals for whom complex II was analyzed. Complex IV
activities were normalized to citrate synthase activity (CIV/
CS). The results showed that CIV/CS activity did not change
with age in fibroblasts (P ¼ 0.148, rho ¼ 0.355; Figure 1d).
Transcript expression levels of complex II catalytic subunits
decrease with age
To further elucidate the cause of the observed decrease in
complex II activity in skin fibroblasts with increasing age, the
transcript expression levels of the two catalytic subunits of
complex II, SDHA and SDHB (i.e., those directly responsible
for the measured enzyme activity), were analyzed in the fi-
broblasts from individuals of different ages. In addition, one
of the two anchoring subunits, SDHC (which is not directly
associated with enzyme activity), was also measured. SDHA,
SDHB, and SDHC expression were studied in fibroblasts
from 25 of the donors used previously and normalized to the
internal control b-actin (Li et al., 2011). It was found that
SDHA transcript expression decreased significantly with age
(P ¼ 0.008, rho ¼ e0.516; Figure 2a), as did SDHB (P ¼
0.001, rho ¼ e0.613; Figure 2b). There was no significant
correlation observed with age for SDHC transcript expression
(P ¼ 0.120, rho ¼ e0.320; Figure 2c).
Protein levels of complex II catalytic subunits also decrease
with age
Because the transcript expression levels of the complex II
subunits SDHA and SDHB decreased with age in fibroblasts,
the translated protein levels of these subunits were chosen
to be investigated to determine whether these also show
a decrease with age. SDHA and SDHB protein levels were
measured in 14 of the donors used previously, via western
blotting, and normalized to the internal control b-actin.
Significant decreases in both SDHA protein levels (P ¼
0.0006, rho ¼ e0.801; Figure 3a) and SDHB protein levels
(P ¼ 0.005, rho ¼ e0.704; Figure 3b) were observed with
increasing donor age. The western blot immunoblot gives an
example of this observation in representative young and old
donors (Figure 3c).
Complex II activity decreases with age in senescent skin
fibroblast populations but not in nonsenescent populations
To further investigate the reason behind the observed decrease
in complex II activity with age in human skin fibroblasts,
fibroblast samples cultured from 15 of the same donors as
used previously (age 6e71 years) were sorted into senescent
and
nonsenescent
populations
for
each
individual
by
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), using a previously
established technique reported in our group (Birket et al.,
2009). This was achieved by selecting cells within the upper
and lower 20% of lipofuscin autofluorescence during the cell
sorting process to represent the senescent and nonsenescent
cell populations, respectively, as lipofuscin is present only in
senescent cells and is a well-established biomarker of senes-
cence (Birket et al., 2009). After cell sorting, senescence was
confirmed using b-galactosidase (b-gal) (Dimri et al., 1995),
which showed that the cells in the lower 20% lipofuscin
autofluorescence contained mostly b-galenegative (non-
senescent) cells (P < 0.0001; Figure 4a), and that the cells in
the upper 20% lipofuscin autofluorescence contained mostly
b-galepositive (senescent) cells (P < 0.0001; Figure 4b). The
lower and upper 20% lipofuscin autofluorescence pop-
ulations are referred to as nonsenescent and senescent pop-
ulations, respectively, in this text.

 CII/CS activity was determined for the senescent and
nonsenescent fibroblast populations for the 15 donors. In the
senescent cell populations there was a significant decrease in
CII/CS activity with age (P ¼ 0.029, rho ¼ e0.563; Figure 5a).
However, in the nonsenescent cell populations there was
no correlation between CII/CS activity and age (P ¼ 0.537,
rho ¼ e0.173; Figure 5b). This decrease in mitochondrial
complex activity in senescent skin fibroblast populations
seemed to be specific to complex II, as no significant change
in CIV/CS activity was observed with increasing age for either
the senescent (P ¼ 0.498, rho ¼ 0.321; data not shown) or
the nonsenescent cell populations (P ¼ 0.556, rho ¼ e0.286;
data not shown).
DISCUSSION
Using a previously established method for determining
mitochondrial complex II activity, it was found that complex
II activity declined with age in human skin fibroblasts, per
unit of mitochondria, which has not been previously reported
for human skin. The observed decrease in complex II with
age is, however, in accordance with some previous studies in
various tissues of nonhuman species. For example, complex
II activity is decreased with age in rat heart, muscle, liver,
kidney, lung, brain, and lymphocytes (Braidy et al., 2011;
Cocco et al., 2005; Kumaran et al., 2004; Sandhu and
Kaur, 2003; Tatarkova et al., 2011). There are few studies of
complex II activity in skin; however, a recent study found that
complex II activity is lower in the skin of naturally aged older

 mice compared to younger mice (Velarde et al., 2012). There
are a limited number of studies in human tissue; however,
previous work using human muscle has demonstrated that
complex II activity does appear to decline with age (Boffoli
et al., 1994; Short et al., 2005). This correlates with our
results; however, studies in other human tissues are required
to determine whether this is a phenomenon observed
throughout the entire human body. In addition, in a model
for older and younger cells, achieved by using human lung
fibroblasts and human lung fibroblasts transfected with
telomerase respectively (Anderson et al., 2014), complex II
activity was found to be much higher in the younger cells
than in the older cells.
It can be speculated that the activity of complex II declined
in an age-related manner as a consequence of factors such as
an increase in ROS abundance caused by lower cellular
defenses. An increase in ROS levels may cause damage to the
nuclear DNA-encoded subunits of complex II as well as the
complex II protein directly, resulting in expression of
dysfunctional mitochondrial subunits and potentially further
ROS production as proposed in the vicious cycle theory of
aging (Bandy and Davison, 1990). A decrease in complex II
activity could also play a direct causal role in the aging
process, as a decrease in activity may result in an increase in
ROS leakage (Quinlan et al., 2012), leading to damage of
cellular components and a decrease in tissue function.
However, further in vivo work in future studies are required to
elucidate whether complex II plays a causal role in aging. It
has been suggested previously that the reason for complex II
being entirely nuclear encoded (and therefore within the
protection of the nuclear repair mechanisms and exposed to
lower ROS levels) is because complex II dysfunction is so
detrimental that protective measures to prevent its dysfunc-
tion have been implemented by cells (Wojtovich et al.,
2013).
We found that the age-related decline in complex II
activity in the skin is specific to fibroblasts, as a decline was
not observed in keratinocytes. It was speculated that this was
because the epidermal skin cells were being replaced on a
regular basis as a result of normal skin turnover (Iizuka,
1994). In agreement with this, the level of the age-related
mitochondrial 3895-bp deletion does not accumulate as
readily in the epidermis as in the dermis (Harbottle and Birch-
Machin, 2006), human dermal fibroblasts are more sensitive
to mitochondrial DNA damage than human dermal kerati-
nocytes (Latimer et al., 2015), and mitochondrial DNA
damage generally accumulates more readily in cells that
undergo slower turnover (Cortopassi et al., 1992). Interest-
ingly, the fibroblasts analyzed in this study showed an
approximately twofold higher level of complex II activity
than the keratinocytes, which was confirmed in dermal and
epidermal tissue directly. Hornig-Do et al. (2007) suggested
that under normal conditions in vivo, fibroblasts have the
potential for faster respiration, as keratinocytes are required
to use their electron transport chain for both energy and
superoxide production for differentiation and are therefore
likely to lack the reserve functional capacity in the electron
transport
chain
for
increased
activity
when
adenosine
triphosphate production is needed, unlike fibroblasts.
Our study suggests that the decline in mitochondrial
complex activity with age in human skin is specific to
complex II, as complex IV showed no detectable change in
activity with age in the skin fibroblasts, which argues against
a general reduction in overall respiratory chain activity and
protein
subunit
levels.
However,
the
activities
of
the
remaining multisubunit complexes would have to be deter-
mined in a wide-ranging program of study to confirm this
speculation.
A possible reason for the decrease in complex II activity
with age could be that the actual activity of complex II is
lower in older individuals per unit of mitochondria, or that
the amount of complex II present per unit of mitochondria is
decreased. It was found that the gene expression levels
of SDHA and SDHB both decreased in an age-dependent
manner in the fibroblasts, which was not found to be the
case for SDHC. The translated protein levels of SDHA and
SDHB were also found to decrease significantly with

 increasing age. Unfortunately, because of the limited sample
amounts, it was not possible to test this for SDHC. These
observations suggest that the amount of complex II per unit of
mitochondria decreased with age. Although SDHC expres-
sion did not show a reduction with age, the level of complex
II activity is likely to be affected by a decrease in the catalytic
subunits SDHA and SDHB, which are vital for activity.
It has been shown previously that increased ROS levels
(generated by superoxide dismutase knockout) can result in
a decrease in SDHB protein expression and in complex II
activity in mouse heart (Morten et al., 2006) and skin
(Velarde et al., 2012), which could also be occurring with
natural age as demonstrated in our work. It has been
demonstrated previously that overexpression of SDHA/SDHB
can restore complex II activity in neuronal cells from the
brains of Huntington disease patients (Benchoua et al., 2006),
which could suggest a possible future therapeutic potential
for the treatment of aging.
In order to further elucidate the reasons behind the
observed decrease in complex II activity with age, the activity
of complex II was examined in senescent and nonsenescent
skin fibroblast cell populations, as senescent cells are thought
to play a prominent role in the aging process, potentially via
mitochondrial dysfunction (Passos et al., 2010; Velarde et al.,
2012). This study demonstrated that complex II activity
decreases in an age-dependent manner in FACS-sorted se-
nescent cells but not in FACS-sorted nonsenescent cells. This
could suggest that the overall decrease in complex II activity
observed in skin fibroblasts with age demonstrated in this
study was due to the senescent cells only. Work investigating
the differences in mitochondrial complex activity between
senescent cells from older and senescent cells from younger
individuals has not been previously reported. This study
provides evidence that senescent cells from older individuals
are less efficient in terms of mitochondrial complex II activity
than senescent cells from younger individuals, which could
have implications in terms of deciphering the causes of the
overall decrease in cellular efficiency observed with age.
Higher levels of ROS generation are present in senescent
compared to nonsenescent cells (Passos et al., 2007),
potentially resulting in increased mitochondrial DNA and
nuclear DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction (Passos
et al., 2007) and a possible decrease in complex II activity if
damage becomes sufficiently high. Damage to senescent
cells may be higher in the skin of older individuals because of
the lower levels of antioxidants observed with age (Micallef
et al., 2007), as well as the age-related decline of senescent
cell removal systems such as the immune system (Rodier and
Campisi, 2011) and the autophagy/lysosomal pathway (Dutta
et al., 2012). These factors could result in lower complex II
activity in senescent cells of older individuals. In conclusion,
the rate of complex II activity within human skin fibroblasts
was shown to be lower in older individuals in this study,
specifically in their senescent cells. It is likely that a decrease
in complex II activity, whether causal or consequential in
terms of the aging process, is likely to be exacerbating
mitochondrial dysfunction with age. Human in vivo data
from future studies will be required to confirm the suggested
role of decreased complex II activity in skin aging. Indeed,
some in vivo data show a decrease in complex II activity with
increasing age in mouse skin (Velarde et al., 2012). By
staining skin sections from young, middle-aged, and old mice
for succinate dehydrogenase (which is a measure of mito-
chondrial complex II activity), they found that the proportion
of sections with high succinate dehydrogenase activity
decreased with increasing age of the mice. Even though we
do not have similar information from our present study (in
fact, succinate dehydrogenase staining is problematic in hu-
man skin (Durham et al., 2002)), we do show that CII/CS
activity in the fibroblasts compared to the keratinocytes
(Figure 1c, i) was mirrored in the original dermal and
epidermal biopsy tissue from the same individual (Figure 1c,
ii) thereby confirming in a small number of cases the in vivo
relevance of our in vitro findings. This provides background
evidence that a future in vivo human study would help to
clarify not only whether complex II plays a causative role or
has a purely consequential role in aging, it also would help to
highlight the potential importance of complex II in other
roles, such as the recently speculated role in the hyperpig-
mentation protective response (Boulton and Birch-Machin,
2015).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary cell culture
Primary skin fibroblasts and keratinocytes were cultured from fore-
skin samples obtained from donors from the Royal Victoria Infirmary
(Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). Ethical approval for this
work was granted by the Newcastle and North Tyneside Research
Ethics Committee (Ref 08/H0906/95), and the research use of the
samples was in accordance with the terms of the written, informed
patient consent. The study was performed in accordance with the
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Fibroblasts were grown in
DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum and penicillin/streptomycin,
and keratinocytes were grown in Epilife medium (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Paisley, UK) containing 10% fetal calf serum and peni-
cillin/streptomycin supplemented with human keratinocyte growth
supplement, both in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2
at 37 �C.
Spectrophotometric analysis of mitochondrial complex
activity
The levels of citrate synthase activity, complex II activity, and
complex
IV activity
were
determined via
spectrophotometric
methods as described previously (Birch-Machin et al., 1994).
Gene expression analysis of complex II subunits
RNA was extracted from cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Manchester, United Kingdom) and used to generate complementary
DNA (cDNA) via reverse transcription. Reverse transcription was
performed using a high-capacity complementary DNA reverse
transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, United Kingdom) per
the manufacturer’s guidelines. Using the generated complementary
DNA, real-time quantitative PCR was performed to determine the
relative expression levels of the complex II subunits SDHA, SDHB,
and SDHC. Primers to amplify a 70-bp region of the SDHA gene
(on chromosome 5), a 77-bp region of the SDHB gene (on
chromosome 1), and an 86-bp region of the SDHC gene (on chro-
mosome 1) (Applied Biosystems) were chosen for analysis. For the
quantitative PCR reaction, the following components were assem-
bled to a final volume of 25 ml per well: deionized H2O, 1� TaqMan

 Gene Expression Assay primer/probe set (Applied Biosystems), and
20-ng template complementary DNA. Reactions were performed on
a StepOnePlus real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) and the
results viewed using StepOne Software version 2.1 (Applied
Biosystems). The following conditions were used for the reaction:
50 �C for 2 minutes; 95 �C for 10 minutes; and 40 cycles of 95 �C for
15 seconds and 60 �C for 1 minute.
SDHA, SDHB, and SDHC transcript levels were normalized to
b-actin, a housekeeping gene transcript at equal levels in all cell
types. Relative expression levels were normalized as determined by
the 2eDDCt method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
Protein concentrations of complex II subunits
To determine the amount of complex II subunit protein present per
sample, western blotting was performed as described previously
(Boulton and Birch-Machin, 2015). The mouse monoclonal primary
antibodies used were SDHA (clone number 2E3GC12FB2AE2,
Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom),
SDHB (clone number
21A11AE7, Abcam), and the positive control b-actin (clone number
mAbcam 8226, Abcam), at a concentration of 1:5,000 in BSA. The
secondary antibody, peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Vector
Laboratories, Peterborough, United Kingdom), was added at a
concentration of 1:5,000 in BSA for SDHA and SDHB, and 1:10,000
in 5% skimmed milk (with 0.1% sodium azide, in TBS-tween) for
b-actin. Films were analyzed using a FluorChem FC2 Imaging
System with reflective white light and results viewed using
AlphaEase FluorChem Software (Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA).
AlphaEase FluorChem Software was also used to quantify proteins
via
densitometry,
during
which
the
band
was
selected
and
the background subtracted to determine overall intensity for each
band.
FACS sorting into senescent and nonsenescent populations
FACS was used to separate human skin fibroblasts into senescent and
nonsenescent populations based on lipofuscin autofluorescence
according to previously described procedures (Birket et al., 2009).
After FACS, senescence-associated b-gal staining was performed
using a senescence cells histochemical staining kit (Sigma-Aldrich,
Poole, United Kingdom). This is based on the observation that b-gal
is only present in senescent cells (Dimri et al., 1995). After staining,
the number of blue cells (senescent cells) and the number of
non-blue cells (nonsenescent cells) were counted under a light
microscope for 500e1000 cells (Birket et al., 2009).
Statistical analysis
When comparing correlations between data sets, nonparametric
Spearman correlation was used to determine statistical significance.
When comparing differences between groups, the unpaired t test
was used. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism
5 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).
