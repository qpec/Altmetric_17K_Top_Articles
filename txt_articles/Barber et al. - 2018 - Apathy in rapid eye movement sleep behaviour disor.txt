Apathy is a common and under-recognized disorder that often emerges in the prodromal phase of Parkinsonian diseases. The
mechanism by which this occurs is not known, but recent evidence from patients with established Parkinson’s disease suggests that
serotonergic dysfunction may play a role. The integrity of the raphe serotonergic system can be assessed alongside dopaminergic
basal ganglia imaging using the radioligand 123I-ioflupane, which binds both serotonin and dopamine transporters. To investigate
the relative roles of these neurotransmitters in prodromal parkinsonism, we imaged patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement
sleep behaviour disorder, the majority of whom will develop a parkinsonian disorder in future. Forty-three patients underwent
brain imaging with 123I-ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography and structural MRI. Apathy was quantified using
the Lille Apathy Rating Scale. Other clinical parkinsonian features were assessed using standard measures. A negative correlation
was observed between apathy severity and serotonergic 123I-ioflupane signal in the dorsal raphe nucleus (r = �0.55, P 5 0.001).
There was no significant correlation between apathy severity and basal ganglia dopaminergic signal, nor between dorsal raphe
signal and other neuropsychiatric scores. This specific association between apathy and raphe 123I-ioflupane signal suggests that the
serotonergic system might represent a target for the treatment of apathy.

 Introduction
Apathy is a common and debilitating condition character-
ized by motivational deficits that impair emotional, social
and behavioural function (Ang et al., 2017). Despite
mounting evidence that apathy is distinct from other neuro-
psychiatric disorders such as depression, little evidence
exists to guide treatment approaches specific to apathy
(Kirsch-Darrow et al., 2011).
Apathy is a prominent feature of parkinsonian disorders,
where it causes a significant burden on patients and care-
givers alike (Muhammed and Husain, 2016). The role of
dopaminergic projections in motivation and reward has led
to much focus on the relationship between dopamine loss
and apathy in Parkinson’s disease (Chong, 2018). Whilst it
is clear that dopamine does indeed modulate apathy in
Parkinson’s disease, its contribution to the underlying aeti-
ology is less certain and may depend upon disease stage
(MacDonald et al., 2013). Recent evidence from functional
neuroimaging suggests that depletion of serotonin may be
an equally important feature in the development of apathy
in early disease (Maillet et al., 2016).
The serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus
(DRN) project extensively to forebrain limbic regions impli-
cated in the pathogenesis of apathy (Hornung, 2003). The
characteristic caudal to rostral spread of brainstem path-
ology in Parkinson’s disease means that when the DRN is
affected, this tends to occur before disease affects the nigro-
striatal dopaminergic system (Braak et al., 2003). It is con-
ceivable, therefore, that pathological changes here may lead
to neuropsychiatric impairment, with corresponding seroto-
nergic imaging deficits, during the prodromal phase of
Parkinson’s disease. Patients with idiopathic rapid eye
movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) present an op-
portunity to study this period, since the majority of RBD
patients will go on to develop a parkinsonian disorder
(Schenck et al., 2013). We recently described a high preva-
lence of apathy in RBD (Barber et al., 2018), but the rela-
tionship to serotonergic depletion has never been studied.
The compound 123I-ioflupane is commonly used in single
photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging
in the investigation of parkinsonian disorders (Brooks,
2016). Because it binds to both dopamine and serotonin
presynaptic transporters, its imaging signal reflects the pre-
dominant transporter type in any given region (Scheffel
et al., 1997; de Win et al., 2005). This property has
made it possible to assess serotonergic signal in the raphe
nuclei, where few dopamine transporters exist, alongside
dopamine
transporter
binding
in
the
basal
ganglia
(Qamhawi et al., 2015). Here, we used this approach to
investigate the neurochemical basis of apathy in RBD. We
quantified apathy using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale
(LARS), which provides a comprehensive assessment of
apathy and can distinguish apathy from depression and
cognitive impairment in patients with RBD (Sockeel et al.,
2006;
Barber
et
al.,
2018).
By
examining
both
dopaminergic and serotonergic regions and exploring a
range of neuropsychiatric features, we sought to describe
the specific contribution of serotonergic loss to the devel-
opment of apathy in this key prodromal population.
Materials and methods
Participants
The study was approved by the local ethical committee and
written, informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Forty-three patients with idiopathic RBD volunteered for
participation
from
an
established
cohort
(Barber
et
al.,
2017). RBD was diagnosed by polysomnography according
to
International
Classification
of
Sleep
Disorders
criteria
(American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2014). In all cases,
RBD was idiopathic, not secondary to another neurological
disorder or antidepressant medication. All patients were exam-
ined on the day of imaging to exclude the presence of clinical
parkinsonism. In the eight participants taking antidepressant
medication, this was withheld for at least 24 h prior to
imaging.
Clinical assessments
Apathy was assessed using the LARS, with a cut-off of 4�22
defining apathetic patients in dichotomized analyses (Sockeel
et
al.,
2006).
Depression
was
assessed
using
the
Beck
Depression Inventory II (BDI); anxiety using the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); and cognition using
the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Early motor im-
pairment was quantified using part III of the Movement
Disorders Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(MDS-UPDRS);
daytime
sleepiness
with
the
Epworth
Sleepiness
Scale;
and
olfaction
using
the
Sniffin’
Sticks
16-item odour identification test. Orthostatic hypotension
was measured as the difference between systolic blood pressure
measured after lying flat for 3 min, and after standing for
2 min (see Barber et al., 2017 for references to the above
scales).
SPECT/CT and MRI acquisition
See the online Supplementary material for details of image
acquisition parameters.
SPECT/CT analysis
123I-ioflupane SPECT scans were rigid-registered to each indi-
vidual’s structural MRI using mutual information as similarity
measure. Structural magnetic resonance images were trans-
formed into 1 mm3 MNI152 space with FMRIB’s non-linear
image registration tool (FNIRT) (Jenkinson et al., 2012). Using
the parameters determined from MRI, individual SPECT scans
were then transformed into MNI152 space.
All regions of interest were defined in MNI152 space
(Supplementary Figs 1–7). Regions of interest for the dorsal
raphe nucleus, median raphe nucleus and ventral tegmental
area were obtained from the Harvard Ascending Arousal
Network Atlas (Fig. 1) (Edlow et al., 2012). Regions for the

 caudate, putamen and accumbens nuclei were derived from the
Harvard-Oxford subcortical structural atlas. A substantia
nigra region was drawn using an in-house template derived
from neuromelanin-sensitive MRI. A background reference
region in the superior lateral occipital cortex was defined
using the Harvard-Oxford cortical structural atlas.
Normalized specific uptake ratios for each region of interest
were calculated as the mean SPECT/CT value of voxels within
that region divided by the mean SPECT/CT value of voxels
within the reference region.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons of variables between apathetic and non-apathetic
patients were made using an independent samples t-test for
continuous variables, and chi-square test for categorical vari-
ables. Pearson coefficients were used to correlate imaging and
clinical variables. Linear regression was used to compare the
relative effects of apathy, depression and cognitive impairment
on dorsal raphe
123I-ioflupane signal. Statistical significance
was considered as P 5 0.05, with Bonferroni thresholds for
multiple comparisons indicated where applicable. All analyses
were carried out in SPSS version 24 (IBM).

Results
Clinical characteristics
The mean age of patients was 65.1 years [standard devi-
ation (SD) 7.60] and 42 patients were male. This high male
to female ratio is representative of prevalent polysomnogra-
phically-diagnosed RBD (Barber et al., 2017). The mean
duration of RBD symptoms was 8.7 years (SD 7.34) and
the mean time from polysomnographic diagnosis was
2.5 years (SD 2.27).
The mean LARS score was �21.0 (SD 6.69) and 18 pa-
tients (42%) scored in the apathetic range of the LARS.
Since
apathy
itself
might
be
a
marker
of
emerging
Parkinsonism, we compared a number of other clinical
variables according to apathy status to investigate whether
apathetic patients had more extensive signs of prodromal
disease (Table 1). Postural hypotension was more severe in
non-apathetic patients, but the significance of this did not
reach
the
Bonferroni-adjusted
threshold
of
P 5 0.006.
There was no difference in the degree of depression, anx-
iety, cognitive impairment, hyposmia, daytime sleepiness,
or the rate of antidepressant use between apathetic and
non-apathetic patients. These data suggest that apathetic
patients on average were not at a more advanced pro-
dromal stage than non-apathetic patients.
Imaging data
Apathetic patients had significantly lower
123I-ioflupane
signal in the DRN than non-apathetic patients (mean
1.45 versus 1.70, P = 0.005), whereas the
123I-ioflupane
signal did not differ in any other region of interest
(Table 1). Across all patients there was a significant nega-
tive correlation between apathy severity and 123I-ioflupane
signal in the DRN (r = �0.55, P 5 0.001), indicating that
greater apathy was associated with reduced serotonin signal
(Fig. 1D). To exclude a possible confounding effect of anti-
depressant medication, we conducted a sensitivity analysis
excluding the eight participants treated with antidepressant
medication. The same association between apathy and

 DRN
signal
was
observed
(r = �0.51,
P = 0.002,
Supplementary Fig. 8).
To ensure the association was not merely an artefact of
signal spillover from neighbouring regions, we performed a
multiple regression analysis including 123I-ioflupane signal
from the nearby midbrain peak as a covariate. This
strengthened further the association between apathy and
DRN signal (Supplementary material).
To investigate whether the association between apathy and
DRN signal was explained by a general reduction in brain
monoamine transporters in apathetic patients, we looked at
the relationship between apathy and 123I-ioflupane signal in
the median raphe nucleus and a number of dopaminergic
regions (Table 2). LARS scores did not correlate significantly
with 123I-ioflupane signal in any of these regions. This spe-
cific association between apathy and signal in the DRN sug-
gests that apathy is not simply a marker of generalized
prodromal neurodegeneration.
We next assessed the degree to which the relationship
between DRN serotonin signal and apathy was dissociable
from other parkinsonian symptoms. Of particular interest
were comparisons with depression and cognitive impair-
ment, respectively, as these syndromes exhibit considerable
phenotypic overlap with apathy. Table 3 shows correl-
ations between signal in the DRN and secondary clinical
measures of interest. None of these correlations reached
significance
(Bonferroni-adjusted
significance
threshold,
P 5 0.006). Signal in the dorsal raphe did not correlate
with age (r = 0.02, P = 0.92).
To further dissociate the closely related neuropsychiatric
features of apathy, depression and cognitive impairment,
we used multiple linear regression, with dorsal raphe 123I-
ioflupane signal as the dependent variable and LARS, BDI
and MOCA scores as predictors. Only LARS scores had a
significant effect on dorsal raphe signal (beta = �0.50,
P = 0.001), whereas BDI scores (beta = �0.17, P = 0.20)
and MOCA scores (beta = �0.09, P = 0.51) did not. Thus
apathy, but not depression or cognitive function, appeared
to
be
significantly
and
specifically
associated
with
123I-ioflupane signal in the DRN.
Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate for the first time a relation-
ship between serotonin loss in the DRN and clinical apathy
in patients with RBD, a key population representing the
prodromal
phase
of
Parkinson’s
disease
and
related
alpha-synucleinopathies. Serotonergic dysfunction is asso-
ciated with apathy early in Parkinson’s disease (Maillet
et al., 2016); our data extend this important finding by
revealing that this association emerges prior to the onset
of clinical parkinsonism. Importantly, neither depression,
anxiety, nor cognition correlated with the DRN serotonin

 signal, further emphasizing apathy as a distinct neuro-
psychiatric entity.
A key dissociation was also seen between DRN seroto-
nergic signal and dopaminergic binding in the basal gang-
lia. The lack of correlation between dopaminergic signal
and apathy not only implies that serotonergic degeneration
might be a key factor in the pathogenesis of apathy, but
also suggests that the association is not explained simply by
more advanced prodromal neurodegeneration in apathetic
patients. This assertion is further supported by the finding
that apathetic patients did not have more severe clinical
markers
of
evolving
parkinsonism
than
non-apathetic
patients.
While patients with idiopathic RBD can offer an unpre-
cedented insight into the early stages of parkinsonian
disorders, they are a heterogeneous population. Around
two-thirds are likely to develop Parkinson’s disease or de-
mentia with Lewy bodies, while a smaller number will
convert to multiple system atrophy (Schenck et al., 2013).
In some cases, however, this may occur more than a decade
from RBD onset, and a minority of individuals may never
develop a neurodegenerative disorder (Iranzo et al., 2017).
The fact that an association between DRN serotonergic
signal and apathy was observed despite this heterogeneity
suggests that the role of serotonin in apathy might be a
particular feature of patients with RBD. One possible
explanation for this is the close anatomical proximity of
the raphe nuclei to the locus coeruleus/subcoeruleus com-
plex, an important player in the regulation of REM sleep.
The arrival of ascending neurodegeneration in tandem in
these neighbouring structures during prodromal disease
would
be
consistent
with
Braak’s
hypothesis
of
Parkinson’s pathology (Braak et al., 2003), and it may be
that the extent to which this occurs underlies the correl-
ation between raphe signal and apathy observed in RBD.
Our findings imply that this serotonin-dependent apathy
is not a harbinger of emerging parkinsonism, but rather an
example of the way in which the differential involvement of
neurotransmitter systems among patients, due to subtle
variations in the anatomical pattern of disease, might ex-
plain some of the phenotypic variation observed in synu-
cleinopathies.
In
patients
with
established
Parkinson’s
disease, for example, it is known that motor signs relate
to nigro-striatal dopamine loss (Benamer et al., 2000),
whilst noradrenergic pathways are implicated in the devel-
opment of postural hypotension (Sommerauer et al., 2018).

 Our data suggest that patients with a greater burden of
disease in serotonergic pathways may represent a subtype
prone to developing apathy.
Although no other studies have examined the relationship
between serotonergic signalling and apathy in RBD, the
possibility that disruption in these pathways affects a sub-
type of apathetic patients rather than being a general
marker of neurodegeneration is supported by a recent
study of patients with early Parkinson’s disease, which
used PET with multiple tracers to further dissociate the
roles of serotonin and dopamine (Maillet et al., 2016).
No differences were observed in serotonin signal between
non-apathetic patients with Parkinson’s disease and control
subjects, despite significantly reduced dopaminergic uptake
in the Parkinson’s disease group. Within Parkinson’s dis-
ease patients, however, reduced serotonin signal was asso-
ciated with the presence of apathy.
Apathy may not be the only consequence of raphe sero-
tonergic degeneration. Using similar methodology to ours
in a large Parkinson’s disease cohort, Qamhawi et al.
(2015) also demonstrated that serotonin depletion affected
a subgroup of patients and was dissociable from dopamin-
ergic degeneration. Apathy was not assessed, but an asso-
ciation
was
found
between
raphe
signal
and
tremor
severity. Given that the whole raphe complex was included
in their region of interest, this result may reflect the role of
other subpopulations of serotonergic neurons, including
more caudal projections to the cerebellum and deep brain
nuclei implicated in the pathogenesis of tremor.
It is unlikely that serotonin signalling alone underlies the
complex clinical syndrome of apathy in parkinsonian dis-
orders. Exogenous dopamine (or dopamine receptor agon-
ists) can not only improve the symptoms of apathy, but
also modulate objective measures of reward sensitivity, a
key component of motivation for action (Thobois et al.,
2013; Muhammed et al., 2016). It is possible that the
differential contributions of serotonin and dopamine loss
to the expression of apathy in Parkinson’s disease may
vary according to disease stage, with mesolimbic dopa-
minergic pathways affected later than the raphe serotoner-
gic system. This might have important implications for the
treatment of apathy in patients with prodromal and early
Parkinson’s disease, where serotonergic agents could con-
ceivably have greater efficacy. Interventional studies test-
ing such hypotheses must be a near-term priority since
little evidence exists to guide the specific treatment of
apathy.
Our
study
has
a
number
of
notable
strengths.
Investigating patients with polysomnographically-proven
RBD provides unparalleled enrichment for cases of pro-
dromal parkinsonism. At this early stage, when neurode-
generation
is
largely
confined
to
the
brainstem,
the
confounding effects of more widespread degeneration invol-
ving other neurotransmitter systems is limited compared to
established Parkinson’s disease patients.
The CT-based attenuation correction that we used for
SPECT/CT processing greatly enhanced the precision with
which we could analyse brainstem structures. The accuracy
of
our
brainstem
nuclei
measurements
was
further
enhanced by the use of histologically derived regions of
interest, giving us the best possible representations of
their true anatomy.
These methodological strengths help to address one of
the main limitations of our study: that the nuclei studied
are small and therefore close to the resolution of our
SPECT imaging. A second limitation is the use of a rela-
tively non-specific SPECT ligand, meaning that our assess-
ment of the serotonergic system is limited to regions that do
not contain significant numbers of dopamine transporters.
Although the lack of a separate control group could be
considered a limitation, the primary aim of our study was
to explore the neural basis for the phenotypic heterogeneity
that occurs amongst RBD patients, rather than to show
how they differ from control subjects. It is interesting to
note, however, that control subjects rarely exhibit apathy
(Barber et al., 2018), despite having similar levels of raphe
serotonin transporters to patients with Parkinson’s disease
(Qamhawi et al., 2015). One possible explanation for this
apparent discrepancy would be that individuals may have
different levels of intrinsic reserve in the raphe serotonergic
system, which might lead to different levels of clinical
apathy only when the system is exposed to a neurodegen-
erative insult.
In summary, we have shown that apathy is associated
with serotonergic depletion in the dorsal raphe nucleus in
patients with idiopathic RBD, suggesting that early degen-
eration in this area might underlie the development of
apathy during the prodromal phase of Parkinson’s disease.
The specific role of serotonin is evidenced by the fact that
this relationship is dissociable from dopaminergic degener-
ation and other neuropsychiatric features, and should
prompt investigation of serotonergic agents in the treatment
of apathy, even in the absence of depression.
