ardiac chamber enlargement and the capacity to increase 
cardiac output are hallmarks of athletic training.1 Typical 
adaptations of the heart to sustained exercise are biventricu-
lar enlargement, enhanced early diastolic filling, and bi-atrial 
dilatation.2 The majority of athletes develop relatively mild 
adaptations, and the current view of athlete’s heart is one of 
adaptive physiology and not preclinical disease.1 The benefits 
of moderate exercise are well recognized,3 and public health 
organizations recommend that adults should engage in 150 
minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.4 In recent 
years, athletic participation has more than doubled in all major 
demographic groups.5 Although myocardial remodeling has 
been documented across a spectrum of physical condition-
ing from recreational marathon runners to elite competitive 
endurance athletes,6,7 the prevalence of cardiac dilatation at 
mild to moderate levels of physical activity is not known. 
Misclassification of cardiac disease in healthy adults may 
lead to erroneous risk stratification, inappropriate manage-
ment, and unnecessary further investigations. In this study, we 
examined a healthy adult population without cardiovascular 
risk factors or genetic variants associated with cardiac disease 
to determine if typical levels of physical activity were associ-
ated with cardiac remodeling.

Methods
Subjects
One thousand one hundred fifty-eight healthy adult volunteers (54% 
female; median age 39.2 years; range 18–97 years) were prospec-
tively recruited by newspaper advertisement as part of the UK Digital 
Background—Cardiac mass and volumes are often elevated in athletes, but it is not known whether moderate physical 
activity is also associated with cardiac dilatation and hypertrophy in a healthy adult population.
Methods and Results—In total, 1096 adults (54% female, median age 39 years) without cardiovascular disease or 
cardiomyopathy-associated genetic variants underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to determine biventricular 
volumes and function. Physical activity was assessed using a validated activity questionnaire. The relationship between 
cardiac parameters and activity was assessed using multiple linear regression adjusting for age, sex, race, and systolic 
blood pressure. Logistic regression was performed to determine the effect of activity on the likelihood of subjects having 
cardiac dilatation or hypertrophy according to standard cardiac magnetic resonance normal ranges. Increasing physical 
activity was associated with greater left ventricular (LV) mass (β=0.23; P<0.0001) and elevated LV and right ventricular 
volumes (LV: β=0.26, P<0.0001; right ventricular: β=0.26, P<0.0001). Physical activity had a larger effect on cardiac 
parameters than systolic blood pressure (0.06≤β≤0.21) and a similar effect to age (−0.20≤β≤−0.31). Increasing physical 
activity was a risk factor for meeting imaging criteria for LV hypertrophy (adjusted odds ratio 2.1; P<0.0001), LV 
dilatation (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; P<0.0001), and right ventricular dilatation (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; P<0.0001).
Conclusions—Exercise-related cardiac remodeling is not confined to athletes, and there is a risk of overdiagnosing cardiac 
dilatation or hypertrophy in a proportion of active, healthy adults.  (Circ Cardiovasc Imaging. 2016;9:e004712.

Heart Project (www.digital-heart.org) between March 2011 and 
January 2015. We excluded participants at screening who had known 
cardiovascular disease or were being treated for hypertension, dia-
betes mellitus, or hypercholesterolemia, or had a first degree relative 
with cardiomyopathy. All subjects were sequenced for disease-caus-
ing cardiomyopathy and channelopathy genes using a comprehen-
sive sequencing assay,8 and 62 individuals with putative pathogenic 
genetic variants were excluded.9 Female subjects were excluded if 
they were pregnant or breastfeeding but were eligible if they took oral 
contraceptives. Standard published safety contraindications to mag-
netic resonance imaging were applied.10 All subjects provided written 
informed consent for participation in the study, which was approved 
by a research ethics committee.
Physical Activity Survey
Physical activity grading was based on the Copenhagen City Heart 
Study Leisure Time Physical Activity Questionnaire, performed 
on the same day as the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. This 
questionnaire has been shown to discriminate subjects with respect 
to maximal oxygen uptake and to predict mortality.3,11 Categories of 
activity were based on participants’ typical level of activity over the 
preceding 12 months and were defined as follows: level I, almost en-
tirely sedentary with no regular exercise; level II, light physical activ-
ity or exercise for 1 to 3 hours per week; level III, moderate physical 
activity or exercise between 3 and 5 hours per week; and level IV, >5 
hours exercise per week or regular competitive sports (Table I in the 
Data Supplement).
Body Composition and Blood Pressure
All measurements were performed by trained research nurses at the 
study center. Height and weight were measured without shoes while 
wearing scrubs. Total body fat mass and lean mass were measured 
using bioelectrical impedance (InBody 230, BioSpace, Los Angeles, 
CA).12 Blood pressure (BP) was measured after 5 minutes rest in ac-
cordance with European Society of Hypertension guidelines13 using 
a calibrated oscillometric device (Omron M7, Omron Corporation, 
Kyoto, Japan).
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Protocol
Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging was performed at a 
single site on a 1.5T Philips Achieva (Best, Netherlands). A standard 
clinical protocol for assessing biventricular function and volumes was 
followed according to published international guidelines.14 Images 
were stored on an open-source database (MRIdb, Imperial College 
London, UK).15 Volumetric analysis of the cine images was performed 
using CMRtools (Cardiovascular Imaging Solutions, London, UK) 
following a standard protocol (Figure 1).16 All measurements were 
obtained from the short-axis stack and used valve tracking on a cor-
responding long-axis cine. Papillary muscle and trabeculations were 
included in the mass measurement. Volumes and mass were indexed 
to body surface area calculated using the Mosteller formula and 
were classified as dilated or nondilated on the basis of indexed nor-
mal ranges stratified by age and sex, as recommended in Society of 
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (SCMR) guidelines.16 These reference 
ranges are the 95% confidence intervals in an independent healthy 
adult population obtained using identical cardiac software and analy-
sis methods.17,18 Indexed volumetric data were left ventricular (LV) 
mass (LVMi), LV and right ventricular (RV) end-diastolic volumes 
(LVEDVi and RVEDVi), LV and RV end-systolic volumes, LV and 
RV stroke volumes (LVSVi and RVSVi), and LV and RV ejection 
fractions. Cardiac index (CI) was derived as (LVSV×heart rate [HR]) 
divided by body surface area. Interstudy and interobserver reproduc-
ibility were assessed in 20 subjects.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed in R (www.r-project.org) using RStudio Server 
(Boston, MA). Categorical variables were expressed as percentages. 
Because of skewed distributions, continuous variables were expressed 
as median±interquartile range. Inter-rater reliability was assessed us-
ing Krippendorff’s alpha coefficient and interstudy agreement using 
Kendall’s Tau coefficient. Confidence intervals were calculated using 
10 000 bootstrap samples.
The Jonckheere–Terpstra test for ordered alternatives was used 
to assess if there was a statistically significant trend of higher me-
dian LVMi, LVEDVi and RVEDVi, indexed LV end-systolic vol-
ume and indexed RV end-systolic volume, LV concentricity, LV SVi 
and RV SVi, CI, and lower median HR and EF, with higher levels 
of physical activity. The differences between other physical and de-
mographic parameters with respect to activity was assessed with the 
Kruskal–Wallis H Test. Differences between each individual activ-
ity level were then assessed using post hoc pairwise Wilcoxon tests, 
Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons (a corrected P value 
of <0.05 was taken to be significant).
Multiple linear regression was used to assess the association 
between activity and continuous cardiac variables. Separate models 
were developed using each cardiac parameter as the outcome variable 
(LVMi, HR, CI, LVEDVi and RVEDVi, SVi, and EF). The indepen-
dent variable was physical activity with covariates of age, sex, eth-
nicity, and systolic BP. Ethnicity was dummy-coded with the largest 
group, white, as the reference.
The associations between activity level and categorical variables 
(presence/absence of dilatation or hypertrophy) were assessed with 
Chi-squared tests and logistic regression models, again adjusted for 
age, sex, race, and systolic BP.
Regression models satisfied the assumptions of linear regression. 
In all tests, a P value <0.05 was taken as significant. Standardized 
β-coefficients are reported in the text, and both standardized and un-
standardized β-coefficients are provided in the tables.
Results
All data sets were analyzed and included in the final analysis. 
Subject characteristics are described in Table 1. Cardiac vol-
umes and function are summarized in Table 2. Reliability of 
cardiac volumetry is given in Table II in the Data Supplement.
Physical Activity
In an average week, 8% of the cohort reported engaging in no 
regular exercise at all (level I), 41% light activity (level II), 
35% moderate physical activity (level III), and 16% >5 hours

of exercise per week (level IV). Men reported higher activity 
levels than women (P<0.0001), and there was a reduction in 
exercise level with increasing age (P=0.01).
Unadjusted Associations Between Activity Level and 
Ventricular Structure and Function
Table 2 and Figure 2 summarize the associations between 
activity level and ventricular mass and volumes.
There was a statistically significant pattern of higher LVMi, 
biventricular volumes, and stroke volumes (LVEDVi, indexed 
LV end-systolic volume, LVSVi, RVEDVi, indexed RV end-
systolic volume, and RVSVi) with higher levels of physical 
activity (all P<0.0001). There was also a significant pattern of 
increasing LV concentricity (LV mass to LV EDV ratio) with 
increasing activity (P=0.003). Resting HR decreased with 
increasing activity (P<0.0001). Consistent with the increased 
SV but decreased resting HR, there was no significant associa-
tion between resting CI and activity level (P=0.94). There was 
a significant pattern of decreasing LV and RV EF as activity 
level increased (LV EF, P<0.0001; RV EF, P<0.0001).
Adjusted Associations Between Activity Level and 
Ventricular Structure and Function
A summary of the associations between activity level and 
measures of ventricular structure and function, adjusted for 
age, sex, ethnicity, and systolic BP, are shown in Table 3. The 
complete regression models are provided in Table III in the 
Data Supplement. There was no interaction between sex and 
activity level for any variable.
After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, and systolic BP, 
LVMi and biventricular volumes remained positively associ-
ated with activity (LVMi, β=0.23; LVEDVi, β=0.26; RVEDVi,

β=0.26; all P<0.0001). For each increase in activity level (I–
IV), LVMi increased by 3.7 g/m2, LVEDVi by 4.1 mL/m2, and 
indexed RVEDVi by 5.0 mL/m2.
By way of comparison, systolic BP had a weaker asso-
ciation with LVEDVi (β=0.08; P=0.005), RVEDVi (β=0.06; 
P=0.03), and LVMi (β=0.21; P<0.0001) compared with activ-
ity level. Age and activity showed a showed a similar strength 
of association with cardiac parameters (LVEDVi, β=−0.32, 
P<0.0001; RVEDVi, β=−0.28, P<0.0001; LVMi, β=−0.21, 
P<0.0001).
LVSVi and RVSVi were positively associated with activity 
after adjustment for potential confounders (LVSVi, β=0.23, 
P<0.0001; RVSVi, β=0.23, P<0.0001). Each increase in 
activity level was associated with an increase in LVSVi of 2.2 
mL/m2 and RVSVi of 2.3 mL/m2. HR had a negative asso-
ciation with activity (β=−0.30, P<0.0001), and each activ-
ity level was associated with a 3.6 bpm decrease in resting 
HR. Overall, there was a weak negative association of activ-
ity and CI (β=−0.07, P=0.01). LV and RV ejection fractions 
showed weak negative associations with increasing activity 
(LV ejection fraction, β=−0.10, P=0.0004; RV ejection frac-
tion, β=−0.09, P=0.003). There was no association between 
concentricity (LV mass to LV EDV ratio) and physical activity 
after adjustment for potential confounders (β=0.03, P=0.34).

(level IV) group, we repeated the multiple regression analy-
ses with the exclusion of the highest activity level group and 
found a similar pattern of remodeling in the level III sub-
jects compared with the other participants. We also compared 
ratiometric scaling with allometric adjustment for height2.7, 
as well as adjustment by body composition and height, and 
confirmed that this did not influence the pattern of findings.19 
Finally, we repeated the analyses with HR, history of cur-
rent smoking, and history of previous smoking as additional 
covariates and found the pattern of the results unchanged 
(data for all sensitivity analyses are given in Tables IV–VII in 
the Data Supplement).
Classification by Normal Ranges
The proportions of participants classified as having LV hyper-
trophy, LV dilatation, or RV dilatation by CMR criteria20 
increased with activity level (Figure 3; all P<0.0001).
In logistic regression models (adjusting for age, sex, eth-
nicity, and systolic BP), activity level remained a significant 
predictor of LV hypertrophy (adjusted odds ratio per activ-
ity level =2.1, P<0.0001), LV dilatation (adjusted odds ratio 
2.2; P<0.0001), and RV dilatation (adjusted odds ratio 2.2; 
P<0.0001). There was no significant interaction between sex 
and activity level (all P≥0.28). Table 4 summarizes the logistic 
regression models.
As mentioned earlier, to ensure these results were not been 
driven by a small number of true athletes in the level IV group, 
we repeated the logistic regression analyses with the exclusion 
of these subjects. The association of activity with LV and RV 
dilatation remained significant (adjusted odds ratio 2.4 for LV 
dilatation [P=0.01] and 1.7 for RV dilatation [P=0.01]), but 
the association with LV hypertrophy was no longer significant 
(adjusted odds ratio 1.9; P=0.13).
To further understand the association between activity and 
ventricular geometry, we compared level I subjects with level 
IV subjects. The resulting adjusted odds ratio was 4.4 for LV 
hypertrophy (P=0.03), 8.5 for LV dilatation (P=0.001), and 
9.1 for RV dilatation (P<0.0001). Similarly, we compared 
level II subjects with level IV subjects; the resulting adjusted 
odds ratio was 5.4 for LV hypertrophy (P<0.0001), 5.3 for LV 
dilatation (P<0.0001), and 6.2 for RV dilatation (P<0.0001).
Finally, we repeated the logistic regression analyses with 
HR, history of current smoking, and history of previous smok-
ing as additional covariates and found the pattern of the results 
unchanged (LV hypertrophy odds ratio 1.6, P=0.01; LV dilata-
tion 1.9, P<0.0001; RV dilatation 1.8, P<0.0001).
Discussion
In adults with no known comorbidities of cardiovascular dis-
ease and no genetic variants associated with cardiomyopa-
thy, increasing physical activity is an independent predictor 
of elevated biventricular volumes and LV mass. The effect of

the heart, there is a risk of overdiagnosing cardiac dilatation or 
hypertrophy in a proportion of active healthy adults.
Regular physical exercise is strongly associated with a 
reduction in all-cause mortality even when comparing mod-
erate activity to a sedentary lifestyle.21 Several mechanisms 
have been proposed for this, including a decrease in myo-
cardial oxygen demand, improved myocardial perfusion, 
and fewer cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, and obesity.22 Physiological adaptations of 
the heart to exercise are mediated by structural, autonomic, 
and metabolic mechanisms, which increase cardiac output,23 
and physical activity is associated with higher end-diastolic 
volumes and lower resting HR.24 In our population, we also 
found that LV mass and biventricular indexed volumes were 
positively associated with activity level, although the differ-
ence between sedentary and light physical activity groups was 
not significant. We observed that the RV may be particularly 
sensitive to training, and previous studies have shown incom-
plete recovery of the RV after exercise and chronic remodel-
ing resistant to detraining.25,26 At least moderate exercise was 
associated with an increase in SV and a decrease in HR—
resulting in no net change to resting CI. A modest decrease 
in biventricular EF was observed at the highest activity level, 
a finding shared with competitive athletes.27 The relationship 
between cardiac adaptation and exercise persisted after cor-
rection for age, sex, ethnicity, and systolic BP. Lean mass is a 
strong predictor of LV mass and volume,19 and exercise may 
facilitate body fat loss, as well as increasing fat-free mass.28 
However, we observed that the relationship between activity 
and cardiac structure was independent of body composition.
We determined if subjects would be classified with car-
diac dilatation or hypertrophy using international guidelines 
for normal ranges in CMR and ensured equivalence by using 
comparable sequences and identical image analysis methods. 
A conservative approach, excluding the most active subjects, 
demonstrated an odds ratio of 2.4 for LV dilatation and 1.7 for 
RV dilatation in those engaging in 3 to 5 hours of exercise per 
week compared with those engaging in <3 hours per week. 
A more liberal analysis, comparing at least 5 hours exercise 
per week to sedentary counterparts, gave odds ratios between 
4.4 and 9.1 for abnormal cardiac indices. Our findings sug-
gest that the interpretation of volumetric parameters when 
investigating low-risk adults should consider each patient’s 
activity level as well as the conventional covariates of age, 
sex, and body surface area to avoid misdiagnosis of structural 
heart disease. Biventricular dilatation with an increase in SV 
are features of the athletic heart, but our findings suggest that 
this pattern may occur with as little as 3 to 5 hours exercise per 
week, and >5 hours exercise is associated with a high propor-
tion of adults outside published normal ranges. A normal LV 
concentricity index is also a feature, which may help to distin-
guish physiological adaptation to exercise from hypertension 
or cardiomyopathy.29
Our cohort of 1096 adults is ≈10× larger than the refer-
ence populations used to derive the recommended normal 
ranges for the CMR community.17,18 The inclusion criteria of 
asymptomatic adults with no known history of cardiac dis-
ease were identical except that we did not confirm a normal 
serum B-type natriuretic peptide. We recruited healthy vol-
unteers by advertisement, but the published reference groups 
were drawn exclusively from hospital employees and their 
relatives in 2006.20 This demographic has low to intermediate 
physical activity and may have under-represented more physi-
cally active adults.30 Compared with the Multi-Ethnic Study 
of Atherosclerosis (MESA) surveyed in 2002, our cohort had 
fewer sedentary adults (8% versus 22%),24 and although par-
ticipation in athletic sports has substantially increased over the 
previous decade,5 the rise in overall population activity has 
been more modest and shows wide geographical variation.31 
In contrast to previous studies, participants with genetic vari-
ants associated with cardiomyopathy were excluded from this 
study, ruling out potential genetic confounder effects.9
Our study has some limitations. The Copenhagen score is 
a validated and pragmatic approach that clinicians can readily 
use for assessing activity level. However, more comprehensive 
surveys, such as those based on the Cross-Cultural Activity 
Participation Study, provide a detailed breakdown of physi-
cal activities, allowing estimation of the metabolic equivalent 
level.32 Because this was an observational study, we could only 
assess the association between variables, but interventional 
studies have confirmed a causal relationship between both 
exercise and detraining on cardiac structure and function.33 
We performed the most comprehensive sequencing currently 
available8 and would expect that, if present at all, rare vari-
ants outside the genes we sequenced would affect <1 in 25 000 
healthy controls.34 We also did not use contrast medium or T1 
mapping in this study and so do not know if unsuspected fibro-
sis was present in those with dilated hearts, although with-
out genetic substrate this would not be expected.35 We did not 
include RV mass in our analysis because freewall thickness is 
challenging to measure accurately in healthy volunteers, and

it is not a diagnostic criterion for cardiomyopathy36; however, 
endurance athletes demonstrate a balanced increase in both 
LV and RV mass, and a similar relationship may be expected 
in moderate exercise.2 Although we do not have outcome 
data, the beneficial effects of exercise are clear,37 and regular 
physical activity may attenuate adverse age-related changes in 
cardiac structure and function.38 There are reports of extreme 
exercise being associated with arrhythmias, but it is unlikely 
that moderate exercise contributes to an arrhythmic substrate 
in healthy volunteers screened for genetic variants.39
In conclusion, activity-related cardiac remodeling is not 
confined to athletes and develops at moderate levels of physi-
cal exercise typical of a healthy adult population. This physio-
logical adaptation should be considered when assessing adults 
for heart disease by CMR because the effects of exercise on 
the heart are of equal or greater importance than those of age 
or BP.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Cardiac chamber enlargement is recognized as a benign, physiological adaptation to sustained athletic training. A common 
dilemma for clinicians is how to interpret the presence of relatively mild, biventricular dilation or hypertrophy in patients 
who are not competitive or endurance athletes but do engage in regular moderate physical activity. We studied the relation-
ship between activity and cardiac remodeling in a cohort of over 1000 adults who had undergone screening for known 
cardiovascular disease and comprehensive sequencing for disease-causing cardiomyopathy genes. We found that increasing 
activity predicted cardiac volumes and left ventricular mass independently of age, sex, systolic blood pressure, and body sur-
face area. Using published normal ranges, adults engaging in 5 or more hours exercise a week had an odds ratio of between 
4.4 and 9.1 for abnormal cardiac indices—with right ventricular dilatation seen in 44%, left ventricular dilatation in 22%, 
and left ventricular hypertrophy in 14%. Even 3 to 5 hours exercise a week was associated with mild cardiac enlargement—
a relationship that was unaffected by heart rate or smoking status. Standard normal ranges have been largely derived from 
sedentary populations and do not account for the effect of activity, which is at least as influential on cardiac volumes as age. 
We found that a validated 4-point scale can objectively quantify a patient’s physical activity to guide clinical interpretation 
of volumetric data. Our study suggests that cardiac chamber enlargement, without a change in left ventricular concentricity 
index, occurs in a proportion of healthy adults engaging in moderate exercise.
