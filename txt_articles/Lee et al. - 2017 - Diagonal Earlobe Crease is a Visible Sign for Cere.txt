We investigated the frequency and clinical significance of diagonal earlobe crease (DELC) in cognitively 
impaired patients using imaging biomarkers, such as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI 
and amyloid-β
 (Aβ
) PET. A total of 471 cognitively impaired patients and 243 cognitively normal (CN) 
individuals were included in this study. Compared with CN individuals, cognitively impaired patients had 
a greater frequency of DELC (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.2, P = 0.007). This relationship was more prominent 
in patients with dementia (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.7, P = 0.002) and subcortical vascular cognitive 
impairment (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.6–3.6, P < 0.001). Compared with Aβ
-negative cognitively impaired 
patients with minimal WMH, Aβ
-positive patients with moderate to severe WMH were significantly 
more likely to exhibit DELC (OR 7.3, 95% CI 3.4–16.0, P < 0.001). We suggest that DELC can serve as a 
useful supportive sign, not only for the presence of cognitive impairment, but also for cerebral small 
vessel disease (CSVD) and Aβ
-positivity. The relationship between DELC and Aβ
-positivity might be 
explained by the causative role of CSVD in Aβ
 accumulation.
Diagonal ear lobe crease (DELC) is a wrinkle-like line extending diagonally from the tragus and across the lobule 
to the rear edge of the auricle of the ear1,2. Previous studies have shown that the presence of DELC predicts cor-
onary artery disease (CAD)1. Although some studies argue that DELC is a phenomenon of skin aging3–5, recent 
studies have shown that DELC is associated with the development of cardiometabolic syndrome6–9, independent 
of age, sex, or race10.
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) are the two most prevalent causes of cog-
nitive impairment in the elderly11. Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques have made it possible to diagnose 
AD and CSVD more accurately during a patient’s lifetime. However, as these imaging assessments are expensive 
and time-intensive, it is important to first screen for people likely to have these diseases. In particular, it would be 
helpful if visible signs of underlying disease processes could be observed on the surface of the body. Further, AD 
and CSVD share common risk factors such as age and cardiometabolic syndrome. We therefore hypothesized that 
DELC would be a visible sign for AD and CSVD.
In this study, we evaluated the frequency of DELC in 471 cognitively impaired patients and 243 cognitively 
normal (CN) individuals. We further investigated the associations between DELC and imaging biomarkers, such 
as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and amyloid-β
 (Aβ
) on 
positron emission tomography (PET).

Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics. 
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the study partici-
pants according to the presence of DELC are presented in Table 1. The frequency of DELC in cognitively impaired 
patients was 59.2%, while it was 44.0% in CN individuals. The DELC group was older than the No DELC group 
for both CN individuals and cognitively impaired patients. In CN individuals, the DELC group had more fre-
quent diabetes mellitus than the No DELC group (P = 0.017). In cognitively impaired patients, the DELC group 
had more frequent hypertension (P = 0.013) and history of stroke (P = 0.014) than the No DELC group.
Detailed demographic and clinical characteristics of 714 study participants according to diagnosis are shown 
in Supplementary Table 1.
The presence of DELC according to cognition and diagnosis. 
The proportion of subjects with DELC 
showed positive linear trends associated with cognitive and diagnostic status (Fig. 1). Specifically, DELC was 
more common in cognitively impaired than in CN participants. DELC was also more common in demented than 
in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants, and more common in MCI than in CN. DELC was more com-
mon in subcortical vascular cognitive impairment (SVCI) than in Alzheimer’s disease-related cognitive impair-
ment (ADCI) participants, and more common in ADCI than in CN. Regression analyses of the presence of DELC 
according to cognitive and diagnostic groups are presented in Table 2. Cognitively impaired patients had more 
frequent DELC than CN individuals on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Compared with CN individ-
uals, patients with MCI and dementia had significantly more frequent DELC in univariate analyses. However, 
this relationship remained significant in patients with dementia (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.24–2.65, P = 0.002), but not 
patients with MCI, on multivariate analysis. Furthermore, patients with SVCI had more frequent DELC than CN 
individuals in multivariate analysis (OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.56–3.63, P = 0.002). There was no significant difference in 
the frequency of DELC between CN individuals and patients with ADCI.
WMH, Aβ
-positivity, and DELC in cognitively impaired patients. 
In cognitively impaired 
patients, the frequencies of Aβ
-positivity and of moderate to severe WMH were 56.1% and 58.8%, respectively 
(Supplementary Table 1). To evaluate the impacts that degree of WMH and Aβ
-positivity had on the presence of 
DELC, we classified the 471 cognitively impaired patients into four groups, based on Aβ
-positivity (Aβ
+/−
) and 
the presence of moderate to severe WMH (WMH+/−
).
Compared with the WMH−
/Aβ
−
 group, the WMH−
/Aβ

, and WMH+/Aβ
+ groups each 
had significantly more frequent DELC on both univariate and multivariate analyses (Table 3). In particular, the 
WMH+/Aβ
+ group exhibited significantly more frequent DELC on multivariate analyses (OR 7.32, 95% CI 
3.35–16.01, P < 0.001).

Discussion
In this study we observed several interesting findings that have not been previously reported, such as the fre-
quency of DELC in cognitively impaired patients, and the associations between DELC, CSVD, and Aβ
-positivity. 
The major findings of the present study were as follows. First, compared with CN individuals, cognitively 
impaired patients more frequently exhibited DELC, and this difference was strongest in patients with dementia or 
SVCI. Second, among cognitively impaired patients, degree of WMH and Aβ
-positivity independently predicted

the presence of DELC. Taken together, our findings suggest that DELC can serve as a useful supportive sign, not 
only for the diagnosis of cognitive impairment, but also for potential CSVD and Aβ
-positivity.
Our first major finding was that DELC was more common in cognitively impaired patients than in individ-
uals with normal cognition. DELC has been reported to be associated with CAD1,2,5,12, and with cardiovascular 
risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and metabolic syndrome6–8. Furthermore, previous 
studies with a large number of healthy subjects have reported that DELC becomes more common with age3,7. 
Although the cognitively impaired patients in this study were older than the CN individuals, the increased fre-
quency of DELC for cognitively impaired patients relative to CN individuals remained after adjustment for age, 
sex, and conventional cardiovascular risk factors known to be associated with DELC. In addition, we found that 
DELC was more common in patients with dementia or SVCI compared with CN individuals. Therefore, our 
findings suggest that DELC seems to be a marker of cognitive impairment, especially in patients with dementia 
or SVCI.
Another noteworthy finding in this study was that WMH burden and Aβ
-positivity independently predicted 
the presence of DELC in cognitively impaired patients. Interestingly, the combination of both moderate to severe 
WMH and Aβ
-positivity was most strongly associated with DELC, compared with the presence of only one or 
neither of these imaging markers. Several previous studies have reported that the presence of DELC may pre-
dict asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease, arterial stiffness, and subclinical atherosclerosis13–16. Moreover, a 
recent prospective study demonstrated a significant association between DELC and the development of ischemic 
stroke17. To date, however, no visible signs have been shown to predict CSVD burden or Aβ
-positivity in cogni-
tively impaired patients. Importantly, our data suggest that DELC may serve as a visible sign for CSVD and Aβ
 
accumulation in clinical practice.
The mechanisms underlying the relationships among DELC, CSVD, and Aβ
 accumulation have not been fully 
investigated. Previous studies showing that DELC is a risk marker for CAD have suggested a common mechanism 
of microvascular changes related to subclinical atherosclerosis, as both the earlobe and myocardium are supplied 
by end-arteries with few collaterals2,5,9,10. There may also be a shared pathophysiology for DELC and CSVD in 
terms of the location of arteriosclerosis, as CSVD is thought to occur between the perforating cerebral arterioles 
or capillaries in the brain18,19, and DELC is known to occur where the branches of the superficial temporal and 
posterior auricular arteries meet20,21. Elastin degeneration could also potentially explain the relationship between 
DELC and CSVD. Specifically, elastin degeneration in the skin may reflect changes in vessel walls with similar 
elastic properties5,22. This is supported by previous studies showing an association between DELC and arterial 
stiffness14,15. Furthermore, Aβ
 is also known to alter the neurovascular unit in the brain23,24, and several previous 
studies have shown that Aβ
 and CSVD interact with each other25,26. Therefore, like CSVD, Aβ
 might affect arteri-
osclerosis, which in turn may lead to DELC and CSVD.
The strengths of this study include a large sample size and relatively sophisticated measurements of DELC 
compared with previous studies. However, some limitations should be considered when interpreting these results. 
First, our study was cross-sectional, precluding claims of causality. Second, while WMH burden was assessed 
using structured semi-quantitative methods, this visual rating scale may not fully reflect the degree of CSVD. 
Finally, since we only collected Aβ
 PET scans on cognitively impaired patients, our interpretations regarding 
amyloid accumulation in normal subjects are limited. Together our results suggest that DELC could be a useful 
supportive sign for the presence of cognitive impairment, CSVD, and Aβ
-positivity, but further investigations are 
required to identify underlying mechanisms of their relationships.
Methods
Study participants. 
A total of 506 patients with cognitive impairment were included from two prospective 
studies using Aβ
 PET and brain MRI scans at the Samsung Medical Center (Seoul, Korea): (1) 114 patients with 
ADCI and 137 with SVCI who underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET scans from September 2008 to 
September 2011; and (2) 177 patients with ADCI and 78 with SVCI who underwent 18F-florbetaben PET scans 
from August 2015 to September 2016. Patients who were clinically diagnosed with either amnestic MCI or prob-
able AD dementia were grouped as ADCI. Patients who were clinically diagnosed with either subcortical vascular 
MCI or subcortical vascular dementia were grouped as SVCI. Clinical diagnosis was established at a multi-disci-
plinary conference applying standard research criteria for MCI and dementia syndromes27,28. Specifically, patients 
with SVCI met the following criteria29: (1) a subjective cognitive complaint from either the patient or caregiver, 
(2) an objective cognitive impairment below the 16th percentile in any domain including attention, language, 
visuospatial, memory, or frontal function on neuropsychological tests30, (3) significant ischemia on brain MRI, 
defined as periventricular WMH ≥
 10 mm and deep WMH ≥
 25 mm, as modified from Fazekas’ ischemia criteria 
and as described in previous studies31,32, and (4) focal neurologic symptoms or signs.
We consecutively recruited 357 CN individuals from the Memory Clinic at the Samsung Medical Center from 
January 2013 to December 2014. All CN individuals had no objective cognitive dysfunction on detailed neu-
ropsychological testing, and underwent brain MRI. Exclusion criteria included history of traumatic brain injury, 
cortical stroke, seizure, brain surgery, and current systemic medical disease that could affect cognition. Since it 
has been shown that the prevalence of DELC increases with age3, we included 261 CN individuals in this study 
who were 60 years of age or older.
We excluded 53 participants for whom we could not discriminate the presence of DELC on 3-dimensional 
(3D) reconstructed brain MRI scans because of head motion, MRI blurring, or folded earlobes. The final sam-
ple of 714 participants included 271 ADCI patients, 200 SVCI patients, and 243 CN individuals. Brain MRI 
confirmed the absence of structural lesions including territorial cerebral infarction, brain tumors, hippocampal 
sclerosis, and vascular malformation. Blood tests included a complete blood count, blood chemistry, vitamin B12/
folate, syphilis serology, and thyroid function tests. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotyping was performed in 664 
(93.0%) of the 714 participants.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient consents. 
We obtained written informed 
consent from each participant. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Samsung 
Medical Center. In addition, all methods were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.
Brain MRI scans. 
All study participants underwent a 3D volumetric brain MRI scan. An Achieva 3.0-Tesla 
MRI scanner (Philips, Best, the Netherlands) was used to acquire 3D T1 Turbo Field Echo MRI data from 714 
participants using the following imaging parameters: sagittal slice thickness of 1.0 mm with 50% overlap; no gap; 
repetition time of 9.9 ms; echo time of 4.6 ms; flip angle of 8°; and matrix size of 240 ×
 240 pixels reconstructed to 
480 ×
 480 over a field of view of 240 mm.
Evaluation of the presence of DELC on 3D-reconstructed MRI scans. 
The ear lobes of study par-
ticipants were assessed using 3D-reconstructed volumetric brain MRI scans. We used the MRIcroGL software 
(version 12 June 2015, freeware, Chris Rorden) to create a 3D model of the head33. We confirmed the accuracy 
and excellent quality of reconstructed images by comparing them with actual participants’ photographs in our 
clinic (Supplementary Figure 1). The typical DELC was defined as a wrinkle-like line extending diagonally from 
the tragus across the lobule to the rear edge of the auricle of the ear. We visually checked for the presence of 
a distinct crease on each earlobe (of complete length and moderate to severe depth), according to a previous 
study34. If no distinct crease was visible on either earlobe, the participant was assigned to the ‘No DELC’ group; 
if a distinct crease was observed on one or both earlobes, then the participant was assigned to the ‘DELC’ group. 
The 3D-reconstructed images of all study participants were examined by 2 trained observers who were blinded to 
participants’ diagnoses and clinical information. The observers had an overall inter-observer agreement of 91.7% 
for the presence of DELC. A representative DELC image and MRI of a cognitively impaired patient are shown in 
Fig. 2.
WMH visual rating scale. 
We used a modified Fazekas scale for visual rating of WMH31,32. On this 
scale, periventricular WMH were classified as P1 (cap or band < 5 mm), P2 (5 mm ≤
 cap or band < 10 mm), 
and P3 (cap or band ≥
 10 mm); deep WMH were classified into D1 (maximum diameter of deep white matter 
lesion < 10 mm), D2 (10 mm ≤
 lesion < 25 mm), and D3 (≥
25 mm). The intra-class correlation coefficients for 
inter-rater reliability of the WMH visual rating scale were excellent (Cohen’s kappa = 0.73–0.91)35. The WMH 
visual rating scale also correlated well with automated measurements of WMH volume36. WMH ratings were 
combined to give a final classification of minimal (combinations of D1 with P1 [D1P1] and D1 with P2 [D1P2]), 
moderate (D2P1, D3P1, D2P2, D3P2, D1P3, and D2P3) or severe (D3P3). We considered moderate to severe 
degree of WMH as the presence of WMH in the present study.

 PET acquisition and analysis. 
11C-PiB PET. 
11C-PiB PET scanning was performed at the Samsung 
Medical Center using a Discovery STe PET/Computed tomography (CT) scanner (GE Medical Systems, 
Milwaukee, WI, USA) operated in 3D scanning mode (35 slices of 4.25 mm thickness spanning the entire brain). 
11C-PiB was injected into an antecubital vein as a bolus at a mean dose of 420 MBq (range 259–550 MBq). A CT 
scan was performed for attenuation correction at 60 minutes after the injection. A 30-minute emission static 
PET scan was then initiated. Data processing was performed with SPM version 2 using Matlab 6.5 (MathWorks, 
Figure 2. DELC (arrows) on photograph (A) and 3D-reconstructed MRI (B) in a cognitively impaired 
patient. The patient’s brain MRI shows severe WMH on FLAIR imaging (C). DELC = diagonal earlobe crease;

Natick, MA). 11C-PiB PET images were co-registered to each individual’s MRI, which were normalized to a 
T1-weighted MRI template.
We used the cerebral cortical region to cerebellum uptake ratio, which is identical to the standardized uptake 
value ratio (SUVR) to measure PiB retention. The cerebellar cortex was used as a reference region, since there is 
little specific binding of PiB in postmortem samples of cerebellar cortex even among those with AD at autopsy37. 
We chose 28 cerebral cortical VOIs for this study, from regions in bilateral frontal, posterior cingulate, parietal, 
lateral temporal, and occipital cortices (Supplementary Table 2). The global PiB uptake ratio was calculated from 
the volume-weighted average SUVR of 28 bilateral cerebral cortical VOIs.
Patients were considered Aβ
-positive if their global PiB SUVR was 1.5 or higher38. The detailed methods for 
11C-PiB PET scanning and the calculation of global PiB retention ratio are described in previous studies38,39.
18F-florbetaben PET. Patients underwent 18F-florbetaben PET scanning at the Samsung Medical Center using 
the same type of scanner used for the 11C-PiB PET scanning in 3D scanning mode (47 slices of 3.3 mm thickness 
spanning the entire brain). CT images were acquired using a 16-slice helical CT (140 KeV, 80 mA; 3.75 mm section 
width) for attenuation correction. For 18F-florbetaben PET, a 20-minute emission PET scan with dynamic mode 
(consisting of 4 ×
 5 min frames) was performed 90 minutes after injection of 300 MBq ± 20% 18F-florbetaben. 
3D PET images were reconstructed in a 128 ×
 128 ×
 48 matrix with a 2 ×
 2 ×
 3.27 mm voxel size using the 
ordered-subsets expectation maximization algorithm (iteration = 4 and subset = 20).
All images were assessed visually by trained experts (nuclear medicine physicians) according to brain amyloid 
plaque load (BAPL) scoring40. Specifically, experts used a regional cortical tracer uptake (RCTU) scoring system 
(RCTU 1: no tracer uptake; RCTU 2: moderate tracer uptake; and RCTU 3: pronounced tracer uptake) in 4 brain 
areas: lateral temporal cortex, frontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, and parietal cortex. An RCTU 
score of 1 in each brain region led to a BAPL score of 1, while an RCTU score of 2 but no RCTU score 3 in any 
brain region led to a BAPL score of 2. An RCTU score of 3 in any of the 4 brain regions led to a BAPL score of 3. 
The resulting scores were condensed into a binary interpretation (BAPL score 1: Aβ
-negative; BAPL score 2 or 3: 
Aβ
-positive).
Statistical analysis. 
Continuous variables were presented as means ± standard deviation (SD) and were 
compared using Student’s t-test. Categorical variables were compared using the Chi-square test or Fisher’s exact 
test. The linear by linear association was applied for trend analyses. Univariate logistic regression analyses were 
performed to determine whether moderate to severe degree of WMH was associated with the presence of DELC. 
In addition, multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed after adjusting for age, sex, hypertension, 
diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and history of stroke and ischemic heart disease. To determine whether mod-
erate to severe degree of WMH and Aβ
-positivity were associated with the presence of DELC, we further adjusted 
for APOE ε
4 status. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS 20 
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
