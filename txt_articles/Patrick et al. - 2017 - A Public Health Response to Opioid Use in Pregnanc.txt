abstract
The use of opioids during pregnancy has grown rapidly in the past decade. 
As opioid use during pregnancy increased, so did complications from their 
use, including neonatal abstinence syndrome. Several state governments 
responded to this increase by prosecuting and incarcerating pregnant 
women with substance use disorders; however, this approach has no proven 
benefi
 ts for maternal or infant health and may lead to avoidance of prenatal 
care and a decreased willingness to engage in substance use disorder 
treatment programs. A public health response, rather than a punitive 
approach to the opioid epidemic and substance use during pregnancy, 
is critical, including the following: a focus on preventing unintended 
pregnancies and improving access to contraception; universal screening 
for alcohol and other drug use in women of childbearing age; knowledge 
and informed consent of maternal drug testing and reporting practices; 
improved access to comprehensive obstetric care, including opioid-
replacement therapy; gender-specifi
 c substance use treatment programs; 
and improved funding for social services and child welfare systems. The 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists supports the value of 
this clinical document as an educational tool (December 2016).
INTRODUCTION
Substance use during pregnancy occurs commonly in the United 
States. In 2009, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration 
estimated that 400 000 infants each year are exposed to alcohol or illicit 
drugs in utero. 
1 Although concern regarding substance use in pregnancy 
is not new, it has recently increased among health care providers, the 
public, and policy makers as the opioid epidemic’s impact reached an 
increasing portion of the US population, including pregnant women 
and their infants. 
2, 
 
3 Several recent studies highlighted an increase in 
prescription opioid use among women of childbearing age 
4 and among 
pregnant women.5,

rate of infants in the United States experiencing opioid withdrawal after

birth, known as neonatal abstinence 
syndrome (NAS), grew nearly fivefold 
over the past decade. 
2, 
 
7 By 2012 
in the United States, on average, 1 
infant was born every 25 minutes 
experiencing signs of withdrawal, 
accounting for an estimated $1.5 
billion in hospital charges. 
2 The 
issues surrounding substance use in 
pregnancy are complex and merit a 
thoughtful public health response 
focused on prevention, expansion of 
treatment to women with substance 
use disorder, and improved funding 
for child welfare systems to improve 
the health of the substance-exposed 
mother-infant dyad.
Primary Prevention
A public health approach to 
substance use in pregnancy should 
begin with primary prevention: 
preventing substance and opioid 
misuse before pregnancy. In 2011, 
the White House Office of National 
Drug Control Policy released a plan 
to respond to the prescription opioid 
epidemic that has 4 main pillars: 
(1) improve public and provider 
education about the abuse potential 
of opioids, (2) reduce the abuse of 
prescription opioids by bolstering 
prescription drug monitoring 
programs, (3) ensure that unused 
opioids are properly disposed, and 
(4) provide law enforcement with 
the tools needed to stop illegal 
prescribing or dispensing of opioids. 
8 
Public health and policy approaches 
to the prescription opioid epidemic 
will help eliminate the burden of 
opioid use disorder before pregnancy 
begins.
Preconception and interconception 
(between pregnancies) care plays 
an important role in improving 
outcomes for pregnant women. 
Counseling during these crucial 
periods may play a role in identifying 
and mitigating risk to mothers 
and their infants. 
9 Although 31% 
to 47% of US pregnancies are 
unintended, research suggests that, 
for women with opioid use disorder, 
the proportion of unintended 
pregnancies was higher than 85%. 
10 
Education and expansion of access to 
effective contraception, particularly 
long-acting reversible contraception 
(LARC) methods, 
 
11 are important 
components of primary prevention. 
Access to LARC methods is supported 
by both the American Academy of 
Family Physicians (AAFP) and the 
American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists (ACOG) 
12, 
13 during 
both the pre- and interconception 
periods. However, there remain 
barriers to highly effective 
contraception in many states. 
For example, the ACOG supports 
placement of LARC devices during 
the immediate postpartum period 
to improve the use of LARC among 
postpartum women 
13; however, 
bundled payments for delivery create 
a relative financial disincentive to 
place LARC devices at the time of 
delivery. State Medicaid programs 
play a critical role in ensuring access 
to highly effective contraception at 
the time when it is desired, including 
the time of delivery. However, 
recent research suggests that states 
are variable in aligning financial 
incentives to ensure access to LARC 
methods if elected at the time of 
delivery. 
14
Improved Identifi
 cation and Access 
to Treatment
The early identification of women 
who use illicit substances during 
pregnancy is vital to improving 
outcomes for both mothers and 
infants. Routine universal screening 
through brief questionnaires for 
drug, alcohol, and tobacco use 
before and throughout pregnancy 
is recommended by the ACOG and 
AAFP. 
9, 
 
15, 
 
16 The ACOG recommends 
that screening consist of a mutual 
dialogue between clinician and 
patient and be performed in 
partnership with the woman with the 
use of validated screening tools, 
 
17, 
18 
with her consent, and screening 
should be applied equally to all 
women, regardless of their age, race, 
ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. 
19
The benefits of drug testing in 
addition to screening during 
pregnancy remain uncertain. 
Targeted urine drug-testing 
programs have been shown to 
disproportionately affect low-income 
women of racial or ethnic 
minorities, 
 
20 
 
– 
23 prompting some to 
develop universal urine toxicology 
testing protocols at the time of 
delivery.24 Although urine toxicology 
tests can provide objective evidence 
of drug use at 1 point in time, 
they do not enable providers to 
determine the frequency of use or to 
characterize the frequency or degree 
of use. 
25, 
 
26 Studies comparing the 
difference between verbal screening 
and urine drug testing are mixed; 1 
study found superior identification 
with verbal screening and another 
identified individuals with positive 
urine drug test results who were 
not previously known to have used 
opioids. 
17, 
 
24 Consistent with ACOG 
policy, informed consent should 
occur at the time of drug testing 
and a woman should be informed 
how a positive test result will be 
used for both medical treatment and 
reporting to child welfare agencies.19
Drug screening and testing in 
pregnancy should be used to identify 
women with substance use disorder 
and enable access to comprehensive 
treatment. Access to comprehensive 
prenatal care and treatment of 
women with substance use disorders 
is associated with fewer preterm 
deliveries, small-for-gestational-age 
infants, and infants with low birth 
weight. 
27 
 
– 
30 The literature suggests 
that pregnancy can motivate women 
with substance use disorders to 
seek treatment.31 However, there 
remains a dearth of comprehensive 
treatment programs geared toward 
pregnant and parenting women. Only 
19 states have treatment programs 
specifically designed for pregnant 
women. 
32 Furthermore, only 15% 
of current treatment centers across

the country offer specific services 
for pregnant women with substance 
use disorders, and the majority of 
these are located in urban areas. 
33 
Women with substance use disorder 
report high rates of past trauma, 
including physical and sexual abuse, 
and need access to gender-specific, 
family-friendly addiction treatment 
programs, psychosocial services, 
and mental health treatment. 
34 
–36 
Trauma-informed services should 
be framed by an understanding of 
the effects of interpersonal violence 
and victimization of women with 
substance use disorders, with a 
focus on creating a strengths-based 
environment to foster resiliency 
and to minimize the possibility of 
retraumatization. 
37 In addition, 
pregnant and parenting women 
are likely to remain in treatment 
if on-site child care and child 
services are provided and staff 
work to develop collaborative and 
nonjudgmental therapeutic alliances 
through the use of trauma-informed 
care approaches. 
38, 
 
39 Positive 
outcomes of treatment in pregnant 
and parenting women who complete 
treatment programs include 
employment, less engagement in 
criminal activity, and lower risk of 
relapse. 
40, 
41
For women with opioid use disorder, 
the abrupt discontinuation of opioids 
in pregnancy can result in preterm 
labor, fetal distress, or fetal demise. 
Furthermore, medically supervised 
withdrawal from opioids in opioid-
dependent women is currently not 
recommended during pregnancy, 
because the literature suggests 
that withdrawal is associated with 
high relapse rates. 
16 Opioid agonist 
therapy, also known as medication-
assisted treatment, with methadone 
or buprenorphine has emerged as the 
standard for pregnant women with 
opioid use disorder. 
42 Opioid agonist 
therapy has been shown to be safe 
and effective in pregnancy 
16, 
 
43, 
44 and 
is associated with improved maternal 
and infant outcomes. 
45, 
 
46
Knowledge of substance use 
during pregnancy is vital to the 
pediatrician’s ability to effectively 
provide care for substance-exposed 
infants. For example, exposure to 
opioids in utero may lead to an infant 
developing NAS. The presentation 
of NAS may be delayed for several 
days depending on several factors 
(eg, timing of maternal drug use, 
drug type, infant metabolism), 
 
47 and 
clinical signs of NAS can be vague 
(eg, irritability, poor feeding). Each of 
these factors creates the possibility 
that a diagnosis of NAS may be 
missed without the knowledge of 
opioid exposure, potentially leading 
to poor outcomes for infants. 
47 
Teamwork between all health care 
providers, including but not limited 
to obstetric, pediatric, family, and 
addiction medicine, is vital to optimal 
care of substance-exposed infants. 
When inadequate information 
about drug exposure exists, testing 
an infant’s urine, meconium, 
or umbilical cord tissue can be 
important in ensuring the optimal 
care of the infant.
Criminal Justice Approaches to 
Substance Use in Pregnancy
In recent years, a number of state 
legislatures have passed new 
laws or applied existing child 
endangerment laws to prosecute 
pregnant women for illicit drug use 
during pregnancy. 
32, 
 
48 The American 
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) first 
published recommendations on 
substance-exposed infants in 1990 
and reaffirmed its position in 1995 
that “punitive measures taken toward 
pregnant women, such as criminal 
prosecution and incarceration, have 
no proven benefits for infant health” 
and argued that “the public must 
be assured of nonpunitive access 
to comprehensive care that meets 
the needs of the substance-abusing 
pregnant woman and her infant.” 
49, 
 
50
More than 20 national organizations 
have since published statements 
against the prosecution and 
punishment of pregnant women who 
use illicit substances: these include 
the American Medical Association, 
the AAFP, the ACOG, the American 
Public Health Association, the 
American Nurses Association, the 
American Psychiatric Association, 
the National Perinatal Association, 
the American Society of Addiction 
Medicine, the March of Dimes, and 
the Association of Women’s Health, 
Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
–60 
Despite the strong consensus from 
the medical and public health 
communities affirming that a 
punitive approach during pregnancy 
is ineffective and potentially harmful, 
there has been a recent increase in 
the number of states passing and 
considering criminal prosecution 
laws that selectively target pregnant 
women with substance use 
disorders. 
61 
– 
63
The existing literature supports the 
position that punitive approaches 
to substance use in pregnancy are 
ineffective and may have detrimental 
effects on both maternal and 
child health. Qualitative research 
performed in pregnant women with 
substance use disorders shows that 
women may avoid prenatal care for 
fear of being reported to the police 
and child protective services. 
23, 
 
64 
– 
66 
In addition, surveys of pregnant 
women found that punitive laws 
targeted at pregnant women who 
use drugs are a significant deterrent 
to obtaining regular prenatal care 
and agreeing to drug testing, 
67 
and women who deliver without 
receiving any prenatal care are more 
likely have a history of substance 
use. 
68 For these reasons, the AAP 
supports an approach toward 
substance use in pregnancy that 
focuses on a public health approach 
of primary prevention, improving 
access to treatment, and promoting 
the provider-patient relationship 
rather than punitive measures 
through the criminal justice system.

Role of Child Welfare Systems
The Child Abuse Protection and 
Treatment Act mandates that 
states have in place “policies and 
procedures to address the needs of 
infants born with and identified as 
being affected by illegal substance 
abuse or withdrawal symptoms from 
prenatal drug exposure.” 
69 Reporting 
requirements for in utero illicit 
substance exposure to child welfare 
systems have been interpreted 
differently by each state. More than 
25% of states currently have statutes 
that consider illicit substance use 
during pregnancy to be reportable 
as child abuse or neglect. 
32 Health 
care providers caring for pregnant 
women with substance use 
disorders and their infants should 
be knowledgeable about their state 
requirements and be able to educate 
women during pregnancy. Notably, 
although the incidence of NAS has 
increased in recent years, 
 
2, 
 
7 federal 
funding for child welfare systems has 
not changed, 
70 even as some state 
child welfare systems are reporting 
an increased workload attributable 
to NAS. 
71 In recent years, Congress 
has addressed the issue of substance-
exposed infants in child welfare 
systems; however, there has not been 
a substantial increase in funding to 
state child welfare systems to bolster 
the response to the growing number 
of opioid-exposed infants. There is an 
urgent need for improved funding to 
child welfare systems to ensure the 
safety of infants and to promote the 
well-being of families.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Opioid use in pregnancy is 
increasingly common, with an 
associated increase in opioid-
exposed infants. This critical public 
health issue demands a public health 
approach grounded in science. For 
these reasons, the AAP recommends 
the following:
1. The treatment of pregnant women 
with substance use disorder 
requires a coordinated, evidence-
based, public health approach. 
The AAP reaffirms its position that 
punitive measures taken toward 
pregnant women are not in the 
best interest of the health of the 
mother-infant dyad.
2. Primary prevention strategies 
should be bolstered to educate 
the public about the addictive 
potential of prescription 
opioids and enhance access to 
reproductive health services, 
including effective forms of 
contraception such as LARC.
3. The ACOG policy that universal 
substance use screening of all 
pregnant women via validated 
screening tools such as 
questionnaires should occur at 
routine health care visits and at 
several points throughout prenatal 
care and be applied equally to all 
women, regardless of age, race, 
ethnicity, or socioeconomic status, 
should be supported. If urine drug 
testing is performed, a reasonable 
effort to obtain a woman’s informed 
consent should be made before 
collecting the sample, and the 
woman should be aware of the 
results and who will have access to 
the results.
4. Access should be improved 
to comprehensive prenatal 
care for pregnant women with 
substance use disorders, including 
medication-assisted treatment 
and gender-specific substance use 
treatment programs that provide 
nonjudgmental, trauma-informed 
services.
5. Health care providers caring 
for women who use substances 
during pregnancy should be 
knowledgeable about their state’s 
reporting mandates around illicit 
drug use and educate pregnant 
women prenatally about these 
requirements. In addition, states 
should clarify which substances 
constitute mandated reporting 
and explicitly define the health 
care provider’s role in reporting.
6. To adequately ensure the safety of 
substance-exposed infants and to 
provide optimal care to families, 
social support services and child 
welfare systems are in need of 
additional funding.
