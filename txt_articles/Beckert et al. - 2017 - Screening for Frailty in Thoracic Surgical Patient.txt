Abstract
Background—The presence of frailty or prefrailty in older adults is a risk factor for postsurgical 
complications. The frailty phenotype can be improved through long-term resistance and aerobic 
training. It is unknown whether short-term preoperative interventions targeting frailty will help to 
mitigate surgical risk. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of frail and 
prefrail patients presenting to a thoracic surgical clinic who could benefit from a frailty reduction 
intervention.
Methods—A prospective cohort study was performed at a single-site thoracic surgical clinic. 
Starting October 1, 2014, surgical candidates 60 years of age or older who consented to be 
screened were included. Patients were screened using an adapted version of Fried’s phenotypic 
frailty criteria: weakness (grip strength), slow gait (15-foot walk), unintentional weight loss, self-
reported exhaustion, and low self-reported physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the 
Elderly). Prefrailty was identified when participants demonstrated one to two frailty 
characteristics; frailty was identified when participants demonstrated three to five frailty 
characteristics.
Results—Of 180 eligible patients, 126 consented, and 125 completed screening. Thirty-nine 
participants (31%) were not frail, 71 (57%) were prefrail, and 15 (12%) were frail. Exhaustion was 
the most common frailty symptom (34%). Frailty prevalence did not significantly differ among 
men and women (men: 10%, women: 14%; p = 0.75).
Conclusions—We found a high proportion of prefrail and frail patients among patients deemed 
candidates for thoracic surgical procedures. This finding indicates that frailty may be 
underrecognized. Substantial numbers of patients may be considered for a presurgical frailty 
reduction intervention.
Frailty is defined as a state of increased vulnerability to physiologic stressors [1, 2]. 
Although no single operational definition exists [3], phenotypic frailty has been shown to 
predict falls, disability, hospitalization, and death [4]. As more patients of advanced age 
present for surgical treatment, there has been growing interest in assessing frailty as a 
surgical risk factor [5–11]. Phenotypic frailty has been shown to predict surgical

 complications, increased hospital length of stay, and postdischarge institutionalization [5, 6]. 
Research has begun to focus on interventions to mitigate the risks of frailty [12]. Some 
frailty activity interventions were able to improve frailty measures in as little time as 6 
weeks [13, 14], thus indicating that a presurgical frailty intervention may also be feasible.
The prevalence of frailty in thoracic surgical candidates is not known. In the study originally 
defining the phenotypic frailty criteria, the prevalence of frailty and prefrailty in a 
community dwelling sample was 7% and 47%, respectively [4]. A systematic review showed 
frailty prevalence ranging from 4.0% to 59.1%, with the overall weighted prevalence of 
frailty at 10.7%, or 9.9% when focusing on physical frailty [15]. Frailty is more prevalent in 
the presence of acute and chronic disease, a finding suggesting that frailty prevalence may 
be higher in surgical groups [4]. In a study of 594 patients presenting for elective surgical 
procedures, 10.4% were frail and 31.3% were prefrail using Fried’s frailty index [5]. 
Thoracic surgical candidates may represent a group with increased comorbidity and frailty, 
and they may be an ideal group to target for an intervention.
The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of frail and prefrail patients 
presenting to a thoracic surgical clinic as potential surgical candidates who could benefit 
from a preoperative frailty intervention. Results from this study will inform an intervention 
designed to reduce frailty and frailty-related surgical complications in this population.
Patients and Methods
Participants
Patients seen in the University of Chicago Thoracic Surgery Clinic in Chicago were actively 
recruited to participate in frailty screening from October 1, 2014 through January 6, 2016. 
These patients were recruited and consented to participate in screening during their first or 
second clinic visit if they were deemed to be candidates for major thoracic surgical 
procedures. Inclusion criteria were age 60 years or older, ability to consent, willingness to 
participate in frailty screening, no obvious contraindication to surgical intervention, and 
thoracic disease that could require major operation (major lung resection, esophagectomy, 
repair of giant paraesophageal hernia, chest wall resection, extended pleurectomy or 
decortication, or sternotomy for thymectomy or other mediastinal process). 
Contraindications to surgical treatment were assessed by participating surgeons based on an 
overview of the patients’ condition, which included their physical status, comorbidities, and 
cancer stage, as appropriate.
Frailty Assessment
Once consent was obtained, subjects were screened using an adapted version of Fried’s 
phenotypic frailty criteria: (1) unintentional weight loss, (2) weakness, (3) exhaustion, (4) 
low physical activity, and (5) slowness [4]. Unintentional weight loss was assessed using 
measured weight loss (if available) or self-reported unintentional weight loss over the 
previous year. A frailty point was assigned if the participant reported a decline of 10 pounds 
or more or 5% body weight in the past year. Weakness was assessed by measuring the grip 
strength of the dominant hand by using a dynamometer (JAMAR Plus+ Hand Dynamometer,

 Instrument M3–200, Patterson Medical, Warrenville, IL). The average of three 
measurements was recorded. A frailty point was assigned if strength was in the lowest 
quintile for sex and body mass index category by using previously established cutpoints [4].
Exhaustion was assessed using two self-reported questions: In the last week, “I felt that 
everything I did was an effort;” and “I could not get going.” Answer options included: rarely 
or none of the time (<1 day), some or a little of the time (1 to 2 days), a moderate amount of 
the time (3 to 4 days), or most of the time (5 to 7 days). Exhaustion was identified if either 
answer was a moderate amount of time (3 to 4 days per week) or most of the time (5 to 7 
days per week). Low physical activity level was assessed using the Physical Activity Scale 
for the Elderly score. A point was assigned if the participant scored in lowest quartile by sex 
by using previously established cutpoints [16].
Slowness was assessed by measuring gait speed over a distance of 15 feet at a normal pace, 
averaged over three trials. A frailty point was assigned if the participant scored in lowest 
quintile by sex and height by using previously established cut-points [4]. The presence of 
one to two criteria indicated prefrailty; three or more criteria indicated frailty.
Covariates
Data were also collected on subjects’ age, body mass index (kg/m2), sex, race, and referral 
diagnosis.
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome studied was the proportion of prefrail and frail patients in the study 
sample. Means (continuous) and frequencies (categorical) were generated for baseline 
characteristics and frailty status. Frailty status and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
(ECOG) performance status were compared [17]. ECOG status was dichotomized as 0 to 1 
(normal) and 2 to 3 (low performance status). Frequencies were also assessed across sex 
subgroups. χ2 tests were used to identify correlation between frailty status and ECOG status 
and to identify significant differences among sex subgroups.
Results
Of the 180 eligible patients, 126 consented, 21 deferred, 13 declined, 10 did not follow up in 
clinic, and 10 were not approached. The average age of the participants was 70.4 years. In 
this sample there was a slightly higher proportion of female patients (51.2%), and most 
patients were white (72.8%). The most common referral diagnosis was for a lung lesion 
(including lung mass and lung nodule; 68.8%). Complete demographic data are presented in 
Table 1. Age breakdown by sex is shown in Figure 1.
In this sample, 68.8% of patients were prefrail or frail (Fig 2). Of the five phenotypic frailty 
characteristics, the most commonly identified characteristic was exhaustion. The least 
commonly identified characteristic was slowness (Fig 3). Frailty status and ECOG status 
were not significantly correlated (p = 0.080; Table 2). Frailty prevalence was not 
significantly different across sex subgroups (men: 9.8%, women: 14.1%; p = 0.75). Women 
were more likely to demonstrate weak grip strength than men (women: 37.5% vs men:

 21.31%; p = 0.046. Men and women were equally likely to demonstrate the remaining four 
frailty criteria (p value range, 0.07 to 0.46).
Comment
In this pilot sample of preoperative thoracic surgical patients, we found that most (68.8%) 
surgical candidates were prefrail or frail. The higher prevalence noted in our sample is not 
surprising given that most patients were referred to a surgical clinic for a diagnosis of lung 
lesions suggestive of malignancy. The high level of frailty in our sample (12.0%) suggests 
that frailty may be underrecognized by clinicians as a surgical risk factor and that mitigating 
options are needed for this population.
The most common frailty criterion in our sample was exhaustion. This was a unique finding 
and possibly specific to patients with cancer who were assessed for frailty. The high 
prevalence of this symptom among thoracic surgical candidates suggests two key 
considerations: (1) cancer and frailty may share common pathways, and (2) thoracic surgical 
candidates may benefit from better depression screening and presurgical treatment. 
Exhaustion is a common complaint in patients with cancer [18], and it may result from a 
hypermetabolic state, which has also been demonstrated in a subset of frail patients [19, 20]. 
Fatigue and depression are difficult to distinguish in patients with cancer [21], and 
exhaustion may indicate higher levels of depression. In either case, the high prevalence of 
exhaustion may be clinically significant. A previous study of patients undergoing 
pancreaticoduodenectomy found exhaustion to be an independent predictor of major surgical 
complications, longer hospital stays, and surgical intensive care admissions [22]. In addition, 
depression has been shown to be a risk factor for death after coronary artery bypass 
procedures [23], and it affects outcomes in other types of operations as well [24, 25].
Frailty status and ECOG performance status were not strongly correlated in this population. 
Many more patients were categorized as prefrail or frail (68.8%) compared with having low 
performance status (11.2%). Frailty measurement likely provides additional information 
missed by ECOG performance status. Although ECOG performance status has also been 
correlated with worse surgical outcomes [26], frailty assessment may be a better marker for 
surgical risk than ECOG performance status alone. Earlier studies of older oncology patients 
indicated that performance status may miss a considerable amount of geriatric health 
syndromes [27, 28].
Frailty prevalence has been previously demonstrated to be higher in women [4]. We found a 
slightly higher prevalence of frailty among women than among men, but this difference was 
not statistically significant. Women with lung cancer appear to have better survival than men 
in all stages and treatment groups [29]. This finding suggests that lung cancer in women may 
have a different natural history. Nonsignificant differences in frailty between the sexes, as 
previously described, may be explained by our small sample size, or alternatively, they may 
reflect this difference in the natural history of lung cancer between the sexes.
The high prevalence of frailty in our sample is an especially important finding given the 
impact of frailty as a surgical risk factor predicting postoperative morbidity and death [5–
Beckert et al.

 11]. In a study of surgical outcomes by Makary and colleagues [5], patients who were 
prefrail or frail had higher rates of postoperative complications, increased length of stay, and 
increased discharge institutionalization. In addition, frailty was shown to improve predictive 
power of traditional risk assessment models. Other investigators have identified similar 
findings in older patients with cancer who were undergoing surgical treatment [30–32]. In a 
study by Tsiouris and associates [8], mortality rates were higher in patients who underwent 
open lobectomy who had an increased modified frailty index. The high prevalence of 
prefrailty and frailty in our population suggests that thoracic surgeons are caring for a 
particularly high-risk group of older adults. Frailty screening becomes particularly important 
in such a group to aid in preoperative discussions of risk and to provide objective targets for 
risk reduction.
Our study shows not only that frailty, a significant surgical risk factor, is prevalent in a 
thoracic surgical clinic, but also that screening for frailty is feasible. Patients were able to 
complete the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly activity questionnaire while waiting for 
their appointment, and screening for the other four frailty criteria typically took less than 10 
minutes of clinic time. In addition, a nonphysician staff member was trained to complete the 
screening, so provider time was not constrained. The greatest limitation to widespread 
screening is the requirement of a dynamometer to measure grip strength. We chose to use a 
frailty screening tool requiring such a device because of the published reports showing that a 
strong association between the phenotypic frailty criteria and surgical outcomes is well-
established. However, other validated screening tools that do not use this equipment do exist, 
and alternatives for measuring grip strength are being developed [33, 34].
Although screening for frailty is feasible and important, it is still unclear whether 
preoperative frailty interventions will reduce frailty-related poor surgical outcomes [35–37]. 
Early work evaluated frailty reduction programs in nonsurgical samples. The most 
consistently positive results have come from physical activity interventions, with the largest 
improvements noted among prefrail patients [12]. Although some interventions have 
occurred over a 6- to 12-month period [38, 39], other studies have shown positive change in 
physical performance tests over as little as 6 weeks [13]. In a study targeting all candidates 
for surgical resection of colorectal cancer, rather than just candidates with frailty, a 
prehabilitation program consisting of exercise, nutrition, and anxiety reduction components 
(average duration, 33 days) significantly improved postoperative function recovery as 
measured by the 6-minute walk test [40]. The ability to improve physical performance over a 
short time is especially important in designing presurgical interventions that would be time 
sensitive.
A limitation of our study was the deferral rate. Subjects were allowed to defer decision to 
their next clinic visit, and some subjects elected this option. It is unclear whether the 
majority of those who deferred would later choose to consent to participation in the study. 
Further investigation is needed to understand reasons for deferral because this may have 
skewed the results. Other limitations include a small sample size, a single site, and a single 
surgical specialty.

 The impressive levels of frailty and prefrailty in our study indicate a need to study the 
impact of a presurgical frailty intervention trial and that thoracic surgical candidates 
comprise an ideal group for study of such an intervention. No frailty intervention studies 
have evaluated whether a preoperative frailty reduction program also reduces surgical 
morbidity and mortality rates. Future work may examine how a brief strength and resistance 
training intervention for prefrail and frail patients affects frailty status, surgical risk 
estimation, and surgical outcomes.
