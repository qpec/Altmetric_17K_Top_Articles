Summary
Background Childhood poverty is associated with elevated later risks for self-directed and externalised violence, but 
how risks are modified by parental socioeconomic mobility remains unclear. We investigated parental income 
trajectories during childhood and subsequent risks of self-harm and violent criminality in young adulthood.
Methods Using Danish national registers, we delineated a nested case-control study of Danish citizens born from 
Jan 1, 1982, to Dec 31, 2000, with first hospital-treated self-harm episodes and first violent crime convictions at ages 
15–33 years. Each case was matched on age and gender to 25 randomly selected controls. Parental income was 
assessed in birth-year and at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years. We considered parental age, the child’s number of 
siblings, parental mental health, and parental education to be covariates. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by 
conditional logistic regression inherently adjusted for age, gender, and calendar year; we then made additional 
adjustments for the covariates considered.
Findings We identified 21 267 first episodes of hospital-treated self-harm, to which we matched 531 675 controls, and 
23 724 first violent crime convictions, to which we matched 593 100 controls. We observed inverse relationships 
between parental income and risks for the two outcomes for each of the ages parental income was measured. The 
longer a child lived in poorer circumstances, the higher their subsequent risks for self-harm and violent criminality, 
and vice versa for time spent living in affluent conditions. Associations were stronger for violent criminality than 
for self-harm. Compared with individuals who were born and remained in the most affluent families, all other 
income trajectories were associated with elevated risks for both outcomes. Those who remained in the least affluent 
quintile showed the highest risks for self-harm (IRR 7·2, 95% CI 6·6–7·9; 1174 [6%] cases) and for violent 
criminality (IRR 13·0; 95% CI 11·9–14·1; 1640 [7%] cases). The risk patterns were attenuated, but essentially 
persisted, after covariate adjustment. For any parental income level at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated 
with lower risk compared with downward mobility.
Interpretation Parental income represents a multitude of unmeasured familial sociodemographic indices. Tackling 
the causes of inequality and associated psychosocial and sociocultural challenges to enable upwards socioeconomic 
mobility could potentially reduce risks for self-directed and externalised violence.

deterioration4,5 to premature death.6 Socioeconomic 
disparities have also been reported in relation to self-
directed and externalised violence risks.7–9 These two 
forms of violence pose serious public health challenges. 
After accidents, intentional self-harm and assault are the 
next two most common causes of death among people 
aged 20–24 years globally,10 with many more affected 
individuals consequently experiencing non-fatal injuries 
and emotional trauma. Although internally and externally 
directed aggression might seem incongruent behaviours, 
they share common individual and familial risk factors, 
including emotional dysregulation, lack of impulse 
control, mental illness, and parental psychopathology,11–13 
prompting calls for more integrated approaches to 
research and prevention.14
Of the three key socioeconomic indices—income, 
education, and occupation—income represents the most 
direct measure of affluence versus deprivation, and is the 
variable that can be tracked most sensitively over time. 
However, in addition to material resources, income also 
strongly indicates a person’s psychosocial and socio-
cultural environment.15 Elevated risks for delinquency and 
internally and externally directed violence have been linked 
with experiencing persistent poverty during childhood.2,9,16 
However, it remains unclear how the associations vary

with changing socioeconomic position across the 
developmental period because parental income trajectories 
are rarely considered. Previous studies have tended to be 
cross-sectional or with short-term follow-up,2,9,16 with 
income averaged throughout childhood or welfare benefit 
receipt applied as measures of familial economic 
circumstances.7,8 How risks for self-directed and external-
ised violence compare across the entire socioeconomic 
spectrum, and whether and how risks for later adverse 
outcome could be modified by socioeconomic mobility 
during childhood, thus remain unknown.
Using national registry data, we investigated the 
associations between parental income inequalities and 
trajectories during childhood and subsequent risks for 
self-harm and violent criminality. Parental income was 
conceptualised as a marker for a multitude of material, 
psychosocial, and sociocultural familial environmental 
circumstances. We examined the associations by parental 
income during childhood, measured at ages 0 years 
(birth-year), 5 years (early childhood), 10 years (middle 
childhood), and 15 years (adolescence); time spent 
growing up in financially disadvantaged versus affluent 
conditions; and parental income trajectories between 
birth and age 15 years.
Methods
Study design and population
We did a nested case-control study of Danish citizens 
who had first hospital-treated self-harm episodes and 
first violent crime convictions at age 15–33 years. In 
Denmark, all residents are registered with the Civil 
Registration System, which captures information on date 
and place of birth, gender, parents’ identities, and 
continuously updated records of residential address and 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We reviewed the published literature on this topic by searching 
for article titles in MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase, published 
from Jan 1, 1990, to April 3, 2018, that included the following 
terms: (income* OR socio-economic* OR socioeconomic* 
OR poverty OR poor* OR inequalit* OR social class OR employ* OR 
unemploy* OR labour OR labor OR work OR occupation* OR 
educat*) AND (maternal OR paternal OR famil* OR parent* OR 
mother* OR father* OR childhood* OR generation* OR 
household*) AND (self-harm* OR self harm* OR suicid* OR 
self-poison* OR self poison* OR self-inj* OR self inj* OR poison* 
OR parasuicid* OR intent* inj* OR overdos* OR violen* OR 
offend* OR crime* OR crimin* OR forensic* OR offense* OR 
offence* OR prison* OR imprison* OR incarcer* OR homicid* OR 
kill* OR murder*). Although it has been widely reported that 
experiencing poverty and socioeconomic disadvantages during 
childhood is associated with elevated risks for delinquency and 
criminality, many of the published studies have been 
cross-sectional, with a focus on low-income or disadvantaged 
families or only considering average family income over time. 
How risks vary by fluctuating familial socioeconomic 
circumstances remains unclear. Similarly, although studies have 
reported differences in risk for suicides and self-harm according to 
varying socioeconomic circumstances, the evidence base for the 
associations between parental income—especially changes in 
income—and subsequent risk of self-harm in offspring is small. 
Therefore, important research questions, including whether and 
how risks for self-harm and violent criminality are modified by 
socioeconomic mobility during childhood, remain to be 
answered. Additionally, although it is increasingly recognised that 
internalised and interpersonal violence are correlated behaviours 
sharing many common determinants, it is unknown how risks for 
these outcomes vary by familial socioeconomic circumstances.
Added value of this study
We did a large population-based study on risks for self-harm 
and violent criminality in young adulthood (ages 15–33 years) 
in relation to parental income trajectories experienced during 
childhood. Parental income was categorised in quintiles, 
measured in the year of the child’s birth, and at ages 5 years, 
10 years, and 15 years. Unlike many previous studies that have 
focused on low-income families, we tracked income across time 
encompassing the whole parental income spectrum, examining 
whether and how risks for the two adverse outcomes could be 
influenced by upwards and downwards socioeconomic mobility 
during childhood. We found a strong graded risk pattern 
showing that the longer a child lived in poorer circumstances, 
the higher the subsequent risks for self-harm and violent 
offending, and vice versa for time spent growing up in affluent 
conditions. The strengths of association were sensitive to 
changing parental income levels across the entire income 
spectrum from birth to age 15 years. Associations were also 
stronger for violent offending than for self-harm. Compared 
with individuals who were born and remained in families with 
the highest parental income at age 15 years, all other parental 
income trajectories were associated with elevated risks for the 
two adverse outcomes. Most importantly, however, for any 
parental income level at birth, being upwardly mobile 
economically was associated with lower risk compared with 
being downwardly mobile.
Implications of all the available evidence
Income inequality during childhood, and not only low income, 
is associated with subsequent risks for self-directed and 
interpersonal violence. Tackling the causes of inequality and 
associated psychosocial challenges to enable upwards 
socioeconomic mobility, at any stage during a child’s 
development, could potentially reduce risks for these correlated 
harmful behaviours in the longer term. Because risk elevations 
were observed across the entire income distribution, effective 
interventions should be implemented population-wide, with 
additional specific initiatives focused on the most 
disadvantaged families.

vital status.17 The study cohort was delineated using this 
resource, with its unique personal identification number 
enabling accurate inter-register linkage. Parental links 
were based on legal relationships. The study cohort 
consisted of all people born in Denmark from Jan 1, 1982, 
to Dec 31, 2000, with two Danish-born parents and both 
parents still residing in Denmark on cohort members’ 
15th birthdays. Restricting the study cohort in this way 
eliminated potential for confounding linked with 
immigration.18 The Danish Data Protection Agency 
approved the study, with data access agreed by the Danish 
Health Data Authority and Statistics Denmark. Because 
it was based exclusively on registry data, according to the 
Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data, Section 10, 
informed consent from cohort members was not 
required.
Cases and controls
We defined cases by identifying individuals with first 
episodes of hospital-treated self-harm or first violent crime 
convictions during 1997–2015 at ages 15–33 years, with 
both outcomes ascertained from the individual’s 
15th birthday. Individuals with hospital-treated self-harm 
episodes before this age were excluded. First hospital-
treated self-harm episodes were identified from the 
National Patient Register19 and the Psychiatric Central 
Research Register20 and classified using a previously 
developed algorithm21 (see appendix p 4 for details). All 
convictions for interpersonal violence, comprising 
homicide, assault, robbery, aggravated burglary or arson, 
possessing a weapon in a public place, threats, extortion, 
human trafficking, abduction, kidnapping, rioting or 
other public order offences, terrorism, and sexual 
offences, were extracted from the National Crime Register. 
We considered the first violent crime conviction after each 
individual’s 15th birthday—the age for adult criminal 
responsibility in Denmark. We used the same lower 
bound of 15 years for self-harm to ensure comparability 
between the outcomes; the upper bound of 33 years is a 
result of the study design. Each person who had self-
harmed or had been convicted for violent criminality was 
matched to 25 randomly selected controls of the same 
gender and age (ie, date of birth) and who had not 
experienced the outcome of interest at the index date for 
each matched case.
Exposures
Parental income was the exposure of interest. Maternal 
and paternal income information was obtained from the 
Income Statistics Register, including information such as 
salaries, entrepreneurial income, capital income, public 
transfer payments, and pensions.22 These data were 
measured in the child’s birth-year (ie, at age 0 years), and 
at ages 5 years, 10 years, and 15 years, irrespective of 
whether the parents were still living together or were 
separated. Maternal and paternal income measured at 
each of these four ages was summed and categorised into 
quintiles derived from the national income distribution of 
all parents in that calendar year, with quintile 1 representing 
the lowest income (ie, least affluent) and quintile 5 the 
highest (most affluent). Further details are available in the 
appendix (p 5).
We constructed a cumulative parental income scale by 
summing the parental income quintiles measured at 
each of the four ages. The scale ranges from 4 to 20, with 
a value of 4 indicating parental income in the lowest 
quintile across all four measurement points (ie, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) 
and 20 representing the highest income quintile at each 
of these ages (ie, 5 + 5 + 5 + 5). If parental income was in 
quintile 3 at three measurement points and quintile 1 at 
the other, the scale would be 10, (ie, 3 + 3 + 3 + 1). Thus, the 
scale quantifies both relative parental income levels and 
their duration between birth and 15th birthday.
Covariates
We considered the following to be covariates: parental 
age, the child’s number of siblings, parental mental 
illness, and parental education. Maternal and paternal 
ages at cohort members’ births and number of full and 
half siblings born before their 15th birthdays were 
obtained from the Civil Registration System.17 Information 
on any secondary care-treated maternal and paternal 
mental illness was obtained from the Psychiatric Central 
Research Register.20 Information on the highest maternal 
and paternal educational levels attained was extracted 
from the Integrated Database for Labour Market Research 
for the year of cohort members’ 15th birthdays.
Statistical analysis
Our use of incidence density sampling enabled estimation 
of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) from conditional logistic 
regression models inherently adjusted for age, gender, 
and calendar year (hereafter referred to as inherent 
adjustment). We made additional adjustments for history 
of maternal and paternal mental illnesses, parental 
education, parental age, and number of full and half 
siblings. All covariates were fitted as categorical variables. 
Analyses were done using Stata version 15.1.
Role of the funding source
The funder had no role in the study design; collection, 
analysis, and interpretation of data; writing of the report; 
or the decision to submit the report for publication. The 
corresponding author (RTW) had full access to all the 
data in the study and had final responsibility for the 
decision to submit for publication.
Results
We identified 21 267 first episodes of hospital-treated self-
harm (of which 8399 [39·5%] occurred in men), to whom 
we matched 531 675 controls, and 23 724 first violent crime 
convictions (of which 20 709 [87·3%] occurred in men), 
to whom we matched 593 100 controls, that occurred 
during 1997–2015 at ages 15–33 years (appendix).

Basic demographic information on people who self-
harmed and committed violent crimes (ie, cases) is 
presented in the appendix (p 6), alongside information on 
covariates for both cases and controls and the associated 
numbers of cases and controls by parental income quintile 
and scale (appendix pp 7–10). We observed inverse 
relationships between parental income at age 15 years and 
risks for the two outcomes (figure 1). These associations 
were non-linear, with cohort members in the lowest 
parental income quintile showing disproportionately 
higher risks (IRR 3·51 [95% CI 3·35–3·68] for self-harm 
and 4·43 [4·23–4·63] for violent offending). Similar risk 
patterns were observed for parental income measured at 
birth-year and at ages 5 years and 10 years (appendix p 11). 
The associations were stronger for violent offending than 
for self-harm, especially so for the lowest income quintile 
(figure 1). Relative risks of self-harm were similar for male 
and female individuals, whereas those for violent offending 
were notably greater for female individuals than for male 
individuals (appendix pp 12–13). However, the relative risk 
patterns in relation to parental income were essentially the 
same for both genders—ie, we observed non-linear, 
inverse relationships between parental income and risks 
for the two outcomes, with cohort members in the lowest 
parental income quintile showing disproportionately 
higher risks (appendix pp 12–13).
When considering risk by duration of parental income 
circumstances through childhood, as shown by the 
cumulative parental income scale, we observed a steep, 
non-linear gradient showing increased risk for lower 
values (ie, lower parental income through childhood; 
figure 2). The associations were also stronger for violent 
offending than for self-harm. Compared with individuals 
from families in the highest income quintile across the 
four ages (ie, with a parent income scale score of 20), 
being brought up in a less affluent family was associated 
with higher risks for both adverse outcomes (figure 2). 
Those who remained in the lowest quintile throughout 
their childhood (ie, score of 4)—1174 (6%) of cohort 
members who had a self-harm episode and 1640 (7%) of 
those who were convicted of a violent offence—showed 
the highest risks (IRR 7·2 [95% CI 6·6–7·9] for self-harm 
and 13·0 [11·9–14·1] for violent criminality). Overall, the 
strengths of association were sensitive to changing 
parental income levels from birth to age 15 across the 
entire income spectrum (figure 2).
We considered the risks for self-harm and violent 
offending in relation to changes in parental income 
quintiles from birth to age 15 years. The number of people 
with adverse outcomes by income trajectories between 
these two ages are reported in table 1 and table 2. The 
reference category for both outcomes was parental income 
quintile 5—ie, the highest income level—at birth-year and 
at age 15 years. Compared with this generic reference, all 
other trajectories had higher risks for both adverse 
outcomes, irrespective of whether their parental income 
moved from a higher to a lower quintile (downwardly 
mobile), from a lower to a higher quintile (upwardly 
mobile), or remained unchanged between the two ages 
(figure 3). For any parental income quintile at birth, the 
higher the income at age 15 years, the lower the risk for 
both outcomes, and for any parental income at age 
15 years, the lower the parental income at birth, the higher 
the risk. In particular, those whose parental income 
belonged to the lowest quintile at birth and remained so at 
age 15 years showed the highest risks: IRR 6·0 (95% CI 
5·6–6·5) for self-harm and 9·9 (9·2–10·6) for violent 
offending. Although risks were still elevated compared 
with the reference group, for those individuals whose

parental income progressed from quintile 1 (lowest 
income) to quintile 5 (highest income) between the 
two ages—ie, the most upwardly mobile group—the 
magnitude of the risk elevations were much reduced 
(IRR 1·6 [95% CI 1·4–2·0] for self-harm and 1·6 [1·3–2·0] 
for violent offending). Moreover, the risk elevations for 
both outcomes linked with this most upwardly mobile 
group were notably smaller than those associated with the 
most downwardly mobile group—ie, those whose parental 
income dropped from the highest to the lowest income 
quintile (2·3 [2·1–2·6] for self-harm and 2·9 [2·6–3·2] for 
violent offending). In general, for any parental income 
stratum at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated 
with lower risk for the two adverse outcomes compared 
with being downwardly mobile (figure 3).
When adjusting for parental education, parental age, 
history of parental mental illnesses, and number of full 
and half siblings, in addition to inherent adjustment for 
age, gender, and calendar year, we found that all IRRs 
were attenuated but the risk gradients across income 
quintiles essentially persisted (figure 4). Estimates 
adjusted for each domain separately, as well as for all

covariates, are presented in the appendix (pp 14–39). 
When considering IRRs across all ages of income 
measurement, parental education explained 31–54% of 
the elevated risks for self-harm and 52–65% for violent 
offending—a considerably greater influence than that 
observed for the other sociodemographic covariates 
assessed separately. Comparing these fully adjusted 
estimates with the inherently adjusted IRRs showed that 
around 42–80% of the elevated risks for self-harm and 
66–83% for violent offending were accounted for by these 
covariates. Inherently and fully adjusted risk estimates by 
cumulative parental income scale and by parental income 
trajectories between birth-year and age 15 years are shown 
in the appendix (pp 40–47). Again, although all IRRs were 
attenuated after adjustment for the covariates, the patterns 
of risk remained.
Discussion
An inverse, non-linear relationship was observed 
between childhood family income and subsequent risks 
for self-harm and violent offending, with those from 
families in the lowest income quintile showing 
disproportionately higher risks. These risk patterns were 
attenuated, but essentially persisted, after covariate 
adjustment. The associations were stronger for violent 
offending than for self-harm, especially so for the lowest 
income quintile. The longer a child lived in poorer 
circumstances, the higher the risks, and conversely, the 
longer the time spent growing up in more affluent 
conditions, the lower the risks. Compared with parental 
income being in the highest income quintile at birth-year 
and also at age 15, all other parental income trajectories 
were associated with higher risks for both adverse 
outcomes. In general, however, for any parental income 
level at birth, being upwardly mobile was associated with 
lower risk versus downward mobility.
To 
our 
knowledge, 
this 
study 
provides 
the 
first examination of the links between childhood family 
income trajectories and subsequent risks for self-directed 
and externalised violence in the same study cohort. 
Although research using Norwegian8 and Swedish23 
registry data has reported an inverse relationship between

family income distribution and later violent criminality 
risk, and findings from a birth-cohort study9 in England 
showed that low household income at 33 months and at 
134 months was associated with increased self-harm risk 
at age 16–18 years, income trajectories were not 
investigated in these studies. Furthermore, although 
repeated experience of poverty during childhood has been 
shown to be more detrimental than transient poverty on 
risks of self-harm and delinquency,2,9,16 the strong risk 
gradients we observed have not been reported before. Our 
findings, however, concur with the risk patterns reported 
for other health outcomes. For example, research in 
Sweden24 has shown that downward income trajectories 
during childhood were linked with elevated risks for 
psychiatric disorders in late adolescence and early 
adulthood versus individuals from the highest familial 
income trajectory. Even children from families with 
slightly lower but increasing levels of income showed 
higher risk compared with this most affluent group. The 
highest risk, however, was observed amongst those whose 
familial income remained consistently low.24 In the UK, 
transition into income poverty during early childhood has 
been linked with raised risk for socioemotional 
behavioural problems in middle childhood.3 Research 
from the USA25 has also found that a large fall in familial 
income during infancy was associated with behavioural 
problems in later childhood.
Although income indicates a family’s material resource 
levels, it also captures a multitude of other influences on 
child development, such as access to services, housing, 
neighbourhood, 
social 
status, 
participation, 
and 
exclusion.1,6,26 Exposure to poverty during birth-year might 
also have adverse implications for in-utero, prenatal, and 
postnatal environments, negatively affecting early child 
neurocognitive development with possible consequences 
for subsequent behavioural outcomes.1 Economic pressure 
raises risks for parental psychopathology, parental conflict 
and separation, negative parenting behaviours, and child 
neglect, leading to harmful impact on children’s 
psychosocial development and wellbeing.3,26,27 Familial 
adversities are also interrelated; children from poorer 
households are more likely than those from more affluent 
backgrounds to be exposed to multiple hardships, with 
deprived families having less material resources to buffer 
the consequences of these experiences.26,27 Parental income 
is thus a marker for a range of familial physical and 
psychosocial environments. In fact, it is unlikely that the 
graded relationships observed in this study could solely be 
explained by the differential access to financial and 
material resources. Exposure to multiple childhood 
adversities has also been shown to have the greatest effect 
on subsequent internalised and externalised violence risks 
compared with other health outcomes.28 Therefore, rather 
than striving to discern the independent effect of parental 
income per se, we interpreted income as a marker for an 
array of measured and unmeasured correlated familial 
circumstances. Adjusting for additional covariates would 
attenuate the IRRs further but residual confounding

10 years, and 15 years
In additional to inherent adjustment for age, gender, and calendar year, we also adjusted for number of full and half-siblings, parental age at cohort member’s birth, 
history of any parental mental illness, and highest levels of maternal and paternal educational attainment. Ref=reference group (incidence rate ratio  = 1).

would remain. It would never be possible to control for or 
even identify all confounders and therefore truly isolate 
the independent effect of income per se. In addition, 
parental education—another indicator for parental 
socioeconomic status—is likely to be one of the key 
determinants of parental income level, and parental age 
and number of half and full siblings might have some 
influence too. Similarly, onset of parental mental illness 
could affect parental income, and could also lie on the 
causal pathway between parental income and offspring 
adverse outcomes. Therefore, in our approach, parental 
education, parental age, parental mental illness, and 
number of siblings should not be considered as being 
confounders of the link between parental income and later 
risks of adverse outcomes in their children. Because of 
these interpretational issues, including potential for 
marked under-adjustment and over-adjustment, we have 
presented the estimates that were inherently adjusted for 
age, gender, and calendar year as our primary results.
Our findings could also partly be explained by 
intergenerational transmission of parental characteristics 
such as emotional dysregulation and antisocial traits, 
which are linked to both parental socioeconomic 
outcomes and offspring propensity for violence, and 
evidence for both social causation and social selection 
has been reported.9,23,26,29 Suicidal and violent behaviours 
also cluster within families.29,30 Although we could not 
elucidate these complex mechanisms, most importantly 
our study has shown that upwards mobility could, to 
some extent, mitigate the risks for both adverse outcomes 
associated with low socioeconomic position at birth.
Stronger associations were observed for violent 
offending than for self-harm, especially in the lowest 
income quintile. This result suggests that any environ-
mental, psychosocial, or sociocultural influences linked 
with low family income were likely to have a bigger impact 
on offspring’s externalised than internalised aggressive 
behaviours. Studies examining other exposures such as 
parental psychopathology11 and frequent residential 
mobility during adolescence31 have also reported stronger 
links for violent offending than for self-harm.
Risk and protective factors for health and wellbeing 
accumulate over the life-course, and they transmit across 
generations.5,32 Our findings suggest that, irrespective of 
familial circumstances at birth, tackling socioeconomic 
inequalities during a child’s upbringing could potentially 
mitigate some of the disadvantages—both monetary and 
non-monetary—linked with low family income. We 
believe that this implication is likely to apply to other 
high-income countries. Ill health and a multitude of 
social problems have been reported to be more prevalent 
in unequal societies.33 Income inequality in Denmark is 
amongst the lowest globally,34 and the country has a 
comprehensive welfare system, including free mental 
and physical health care, for the entire population. It is 
thus most likely that the graded risk patterns that we 
observed would be more pronounced in countries with 
higher income inequalities, greater and more widespread 
levels of poverty, and lower redistribution of resources, 
such as the UK. A US study35 reported that implementation 
of the Earned Income Tax Credit to alleviate poverty was 
associated with enhanced child development. Secondary 
analysis of the Great Smoky Mountains Study has also 
revealed that children of families receiving income 
supplement from a gambling casino subsequently 
showed lower risks for psychopathology and minor 
offences than those who did not participate in the 
intervention.36,37 Improved parental wellbeing, parenting 
quality, and familial interactions were some of the factors 
linked with improved offspring outcomes in these 
studies, suggesting that the benefits of additional income 
went beyond improved material resources alone.
In addition to poverty alleviation, national initiatives are 
needed to support upwards social mobility, such as wider 
access to better educational, training, and employment 
opportunities; reduction of neighbourhood violence; 
tackling of gang culture; promotion of community 
cohesion; stable housing; and positive parenting skills. 
Integrated actions from educational, social, and mental 
health services are also needed to help families to tackle 
the multiple adversities linked with poverty, and to 
prevent social exclusion of those who are economically 
disadvantaged. Our results indicate that much of the risks 
of self-harm and interpersonal violence in young people 
could be attributed to parental educational attainment 
level, suggesting that enhancing education might be key 
to reducing intergenerational transmission of these risks. 
Elevated risks for self-harm and violent criminality were 
not only found among individuals in the lowest income 
stratum—they were observed across the entire income 
distribution. One-size-fits-all public health interventions 
might benefit the most affluent recipients more than 
those from more disadvantaged backgrounds, resulting 
in an inadvertent widening of inequalities;38 therefore, to 
maximise public health impact, effective interventions 
must be implemented population-wide, with additional 
specific initiatives focused on the most disadvantaged 
families.
A key strength of our study was use of Danish national 
registry data, which provided routine longitudinal 
recording of parental income for the entire population, 
and statistical power and precision. Risks were assessed 
in association with the whole income distribution, not 
only low versus high income, and in relation to income 
mobility during childhood. By implementing a nested 
case-control study, complex time-dependent influences 
and cohort effects linked with parental income levels 
(eg, inflation) were accounted for intrinsically by design. 
Investigation of both self-directed and externalised 
violence in the same cohort also enabled associations 
with parental income to be compared without differential 
intercohort biases.
Our study has some limitations. We included only 
secondary care-treated self-harm cases and violent crime

convictions. Thus, less serious, unregistered self-harm 
and interpersonal violence episodes were not examined. 
We were unable to adjust for parental violent criminality29 
because national crime records were only available from 
1981. However, a history of parental violent offending is 
likely to be a marker for a multitude of household 
dysfunctionalities, and controlling for it would thus 
grossly overadjust the relative risk estimates. Finally, 
although the cumulative parental income scale is an 
indicator of relative parental income levels and their 
duration during childhood, it does not distinguish the 
timing of exposure.
In conclusion, childhood family income is associated 
with later suicidality and violent criminality, with 
individuals growing up in the lowest income families 
having disproportionately elevated risks. The longer a 
child lives in poorer circumstances, the higher their risks 
for internalised and externalised violence and vice versa 
for time spent growing up in affluent conditions. 
Tackling the underlying causes of inequality to enable 
upwards socioeconomic mobility, at any stage during a 
child’s development, could potentially ameliorate risks 
for these destructive behaviours in the longer term. 
Future research could investigate crucial and sensitive 
periods of exposure to inform on the most effective 
timing for intervention. The promotion and enablement 
of upwards socioeconomic mobility for large sections 
of the population could also ultimately reduce the 
likelihood of intergenerational transmission of inequality, 
producing substantive societal gains.
