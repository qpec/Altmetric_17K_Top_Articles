Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that is responsible for the current 
epidemic in Brazil and the Americas1,2. ZIKV has been causally 
associated with fetal microcephaly, intrauterine growth restriction, 
and other birth defects in both humans3–8 and mice9–11. The rapid 
development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine is a global 
health priority1,2, but very little is currently known about ZIKV 
immunology and mechanisms of immune protection. Here we 
show that a single immunization with a plasmid DNA vaccine or a 
purified inactivated virus vaccine provides complete protection in 
susceptible mice against challenge with a strain of ZIKV involved 
in the outbreak in northeast Brazil. This ZIKV strain has recently 
been shown to cross the placenta and to induce fetal microcephaly 
and other congenital malformations in mice11. We produced DNA 
vaccines expressing ZIKV pre-membrane and envelope (prM-Env), 
as well as a series of deletion mutants. The prM-Env DNA vaccine, 
but not the deletion mutants, afforded complete protection against 
ZIKV, as measured by absence of detectable viraemia following 
challenge, and protective efficacy correlated with Env-specific 
antibody titers. Adoptive transfer of purified IgG from vaccinated 
mice conferred passive protection, and depletion of CD4 and CD8 
T lymphocytes in vaccinated mice did not abrogate this protection. 
These data demonstrate that protection against ZIKV challenge 
can be achieved by single-shot subunit and inactivated virus 
vaccines in mice and that Env-specific antibody titers represent key 
immunologic correlates of protection. Our findings suggest that the 
development of a ZIKV vaccine for humans is likely to be achievable.
The World Health Organization declared the clusters of microcephaly 
 
and neurological disorders and their association with ZIKV infection 
to be a global public health emergency on February 1, 2016. ZIKV is 
believed to cause neuropathology in developing fetuses by crossing 
the placenta and targeting cortical neural progenitor cells9–14, leading 
 
to impaired neurogenesis and resulting in microcephaly and other 
 
congenital malformations. ZIKV has also been associated with neuro-
logic conditions in adults, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome15.
Vaccines have been developed for other flaviviruses, including yellow 
 
fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, 
and dengue viruses, but no vaccine currently exists for ZIKV. To 
develop preclinical challenge models for candidate ZIKV vaccines, 
we obtained low-passage ZIKV isolates from northeast Brazil (Brazil/
ZKV2015; University of São Paulo)11 and Puerto Rico (PRVABC59; US 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) (Extended Data Fig. 1). We 
expanded these viruses in Vero cells to generate preclinical challenge 
stocks, which we termed ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-PR, respectively. These 
ZIKV strains are part of the Asian ZIKV lineage16 and differ from each 
other by five amino acids in the polyprotein (Extended Data Fig. 2). 
 
The Brazil/ZKV2015 strain has also recently been reported to reca-
pitulate key clinical manifestations, including fetal microcephaly and 
intrauterine growth restriction, in wild-type SJL mice11. Similarly, the 
related French Polynesian H/PF/2013 strain has been shown to induce 
placental damage and fetal demise in Ifnar−/− C57BL/6 mice as well 
as in wild-type C57BL/6 mice following IFN-α receptor blockade10.
We designed ZIKV prM-Env immunogens based on the Brazil 
BeH815744 strain (Extended Data Fig. 2) and optimized them for 
increased antigen expression. We also designed deletion mutants 
lacking prM and/or lacking the transmembrane region (Δ 
TM) or the 
full stem (Δ 
stem) of Env (Fig. 1a). Plasmid DNA vaccines encoding 
these antigens were produced, and transgene expression was veri-
fied by western blot (Fig. 1b). To assess the immunogenicity of these 
 
vaccines, groups of Balb/c mice (n = 
 5–10 per group) received a single 
immunization of 50 μ 
g of each DNA vaccine by the intramuscular (i.m.) 
route at week 0. Env-specific antibody responses were evaluated at week 
3 by ELISA. The prM-Env DNA vaccine elicited higher Env-specific 
antibody titers than did the Env DNA vaccine and all of the Δ 
TM 
and Δ 
stem deletion mutants (Fig. 1c), indicating the importance of 
including prM as well as the full-length Env sequence. No prM-specific 
antibody responses were detected (Extended Data Fig. 3). The prM-
Env DNA vaccine also induced ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies 
after a single immunization (Table 1), as measured by a virus-specific 
microneutralization assay17. In addition, the prM-Env DNA vaccine 
induced Env-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T-lymphocyte responses, as 
assessed by IFNγ 
 ELISPOT and multiparameter intracellular cytokine 
staining assays (Fig. 1d, e).
To assess the protective efficacy of these DNA vaccines against ZIKV 
challenge, we infected vaccinated or sham control Balb/c mice at week 4 
by the intravenous (i.v.) route with 105 viral particles (102 plaque-forming 
 
units (PFU)) of ZIKV-BR or ZIKV-PR. Viral loads following ZIKV 
challenge were quantitated by RT–PCR18. Sham-vaccinated mice inoc-
ulated with ZIKV-BR developed approximately 6 days of detectable 
viraemia with a mean peak viral load of 5.42 log copies per ml (range 
4.55–6.57 log copies per ml; n = 
 10) on day 3 after challenge (Fig. 2a). 
In contrast, a single immunization with the prM-Env DNA vaccine 
provided complete protection against ZIKV-BR challenge with no 
detectable viraemia (< 
100 copies per ml) at any time point (n = 
 10). 
Complete protection was also observed when vaccinated mice were 
challenged at week 8 (data not shown). The prM-Env DNA vaccine 
also afforded complete protection against ZIKV-PR challenge (n = 5). 
ZIKV-PR replicated to slightly lower levels (mean peak viral load 
4.96 log copies per ml; range 4.80–5.33 log copies per ml; n = 
 5) than 
did ZIKV-BR in sham controls. In contrast with the prM-Env DNA 
vaccine, the DNA vaccines lacking prM as well as the Δ 
TM and Δ 
stem 
deletion mutants did not provide complete protection against ZIKV-BR 
challenge, although viral loads were still reduced in these animals as 
compared with sham controls (Fig. 2b).
The varying degrees of protection obtained with this set of DNA 
vaccines allowed for an analysis of immune correlates of protection. 
Protective efficacy correlated with Env-specific binding antibody titers

(P = 
 0.0005 comparing protected versus infected animals; Fig. 2c) 
 
as well as ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibody titers > 
10 (Table 1). 
In addition, peak viral loads on day 3 were inversely correlated with 
antibody titers (P < 
 0.0001, R2 = 
 0.72; Fig. 2d). These data suggest that 
Env-specific antibodies were critical for the protective efficacy of DNA 
vaccines against ZIKV-BR challenge. Mice that received two immuniza-
tions with the prM-Env DNA vaccine at week 0 and week 4 developed 
high neutralizing antibody titers of 1,022 at week 8 (Table 1) and were 
also protected against ZIKV-BR challenge (data not shown).
The prM-Env DNA vaccine also provided complete protection 
against ZIKV-BR challenge in SJL mice (Extended Data Fig. 4) and 
against both ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-PR challenge in C57BL/6 mice 
(Extended Data Figs 5 and 6). ZIKV-BR replicated efficiently in SJL 
mice, consistent with a previous study11, although at slightly lower 
 
levels (mean peak viral load 4.70 log copies per ml; range 3.50–5.92 log 
copies per ml; n = 
 5) than in Balb/c mice (Fig. 2a). In contrast, both 
ZIKV-BR and ZIKV-PR replicated poorly in C57BL/6 mice (Extended 
Data Fig. 5), also consistent with previous reports, potentially as a result 
of robust IFN-α 
-mediated innate immune restriction in this strain of 
mice10,11,19,20.
To investigate the immunological mechanism of protection against 
ZIKV-BR challenge, we purified IgG from serum from Balb/c mice 
 
vaccinated with prM-Env DNA. Passive infusion of varying quantities of 
purified IgG by the i.v. route resulted in median Env-specific log serum 
antibody titers of 2.82 (high), 2.35 (mid) and 1.87 (low) in recipient 
mice following adoptive transfer (Fig. 3a). All recipient mice with log 
serum antibody titers of 2.35 or higher were protected against ZIKV-BR 
challenge (Fig. 3b, c), demonstrating that protection can be mediated by 
vaccine-elicited IgG alone and confirming that the magnitude of Env-
specific antibody titers correlates with protective efficacy (P < 0.0001, 
Fig. 3b). In contrast, only 1 out of 5 recipient mice that received low 
levels of Env-specific IgG were protected, although they still exhibited 
 
reduced viral loads compared with sham controls (Extended Data 
 
Fig. 7). These data define the minimum threshold of Env-specific anti-
body titers required for protection in this model.
We next depleted CD4+ and/or CD8+ T lymphocytes in prM-Env- 
vaccinated mice on day − 
2 and day − 
1 before challenge (> 
99.9% 
 
efficiency; Extended Data Fig. 8). Depletion of these T-lymphocyte subsets 
 
did not detectably abrogate the protective efficacy of the prM-Env 
 
DNA vaccine against ZIKV-BR challenge (Fig. 3d). These data indi-
cate that Env-specific T-lymphocyte responses were not required 
for protection in this model, although these findings do not exclude 
the possibility that ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses may be 
 
beneficial in other settings.
To extend these observations to a vaccine platform that has histori-
cally provided clinical efficacy against other flaviviruses, we explored 
the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a ZIKV purified inac-
tivated virus (PIV) vaccine derived from the Puerto Rico PRVABC59

strain. Groups of Balb/c mice (n = 
 5 per group) received a single 
immunization of 1 μ 
g of the PIV vaccine with alum or alum alone by 
the i.m. or subcutaneous (s.c.) routes. Antibody titers were higher in 
the group that received the PIV vaccine by the i.m. route rather than 
by the s.c. route, as compared by ELISA (Fig. 4a). The PIV vaccine 
by both routes also induced ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies 
after a single immunization (Table 1). At week 4, all mice were i.v. 
challenged with ZIKV-BR as described above. Complete protection 
was observed in the group that received the PIV vaccine by the i.m. 
route (Fig. 4b, c). Two mice that received the PIV vaccine by the 
s.c. route showed brief low levels of viraemia (Fig. 4c), potentially 
consistent with the lower Env-specific binding antibody titers in this 
group (Fig. 4b).
Our data demonstrate that a single immunization with a DNA 
 
vaccine or a PIV vaccine provided complete protection against paren-
teral ZIKV challenge in mice. The prM-Env DNA vaccine afforded 
protection in three strains of mice and against both ZIKV-BR and 
ZIKV-PR challenges, suggesting the generalizability of these observa-
tions. Protective efficacy was mediated by vaccine-elicited Env-specific 
antibodies, as evidenced by (1) statistical analyses of immune correlates

of protection (Figs 2c, d, 4b), (2) adoptive transfer studies with purified 
IgG from vaccinated mice (Fig. 3a–c), and (3) T-lymphocyte depletion 
studies in vaccinated mice (Fig. 3d). The adoptive transfer studies also 
defined the threshold of Env-specific antibody titers required for pro-
tection in this model.
It is difficult to extrapolate directly the results from these vaccine 
studies in mice to potential clinical efficacy in humans. Nevertheless, 
the robust protection observed in the present studies and the clear 
immune correlates of protection suggest a path forward for ZIKV 
vaccine development in humans. Of note, similar antibody-based 
correlates of protection, including neutralizing antibody titers > 
10, 
have been reported for other flavivirus vaccines, including yellow 
fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Japanese encephalitis 
virus21–23. Moreover, the ZIKV-BR challenge isolate used in the pres-
ent study has been shown in wild-type SJL mice to recapitulate certain 
key clinical findings of ZIKV infection in humans, including fetal 
microcephaly and intrauterine growth retardation11. ZIKV-BR did 
not lead to a fatal outcome in wild-type Balb/c and SJL mice, as has 
been observed in Ifnar−/− C57BL/6 mice10,19,20, but the magnitude 
and duration of viraemia in Balb/c and SJL mice appear compara-
ble with that in humans2, suggesting the potential relevance of this 
model. It is notable that ZIKV-BR replicated efficiently in wild-type 
Balb/c and SJL mice (Fig. 2a, Extended Data Fig. 4), but replicated 
poorly in wild-type C57BL/6 mice (Extended Data Fig. 5), which is 
consistent with previous observations10,11 and indicates important 
strain-specific differences for ZIKV infectivity. Further investiga-
tion into the immunologic mechanisms underlying these differences 
may lead to insights into innate immune control of ZIKV. Moreover, 
further characterization of the susceptible Balb/c and SJL murine 
models may facilitate future studies of ZIKV pathogenesis and the 
development of antiviral interventions. Future studies will also need 
to address the potential relevance of cross-reactive antibodies against 
dengue virus and other flaviviruses on ZIKV vaccine immunogenicity 
and protective efficacy.
The epidemiology of the current ZIKV outbreak1,2 and the clinical 
consequences for fetuses in pregnant women who become infected3–8 
necessitate the urgent development of a ZIKV vaccine. Our data 
demonstrate that complete protection against ZIKV challenge was 
 
reliably and robustly achieved with both DNA vaccines and purified 
inactivated virus vaccines in susceptible mice. These vaccine platforms 
have previously been used at comparable doses to develop vaccines for 
other flaviviruses, including West Nile virus24,25, dengue viruses26,27, 
tick-borne encephalitis virus28,29, and Japanese encephalitis virus30, 
and may offer safety advantages over live attenuated and replicating 
flavivirus vaccines, particularly for pregnant women. Moreover, the 
 
magnitude of Env-specific antibody titers that provide complete 
 
protection against ZIKV challenge in mice should be readily achievable 
by DNA vaccines and purified inactivated virus vaccines in humans. 
Taken together, our findings provide substantial optimism that the 
development of a safe and effective ZIKV vaccine for humans will 
probably be feasible.

METHODS
Animals. Balb/c, SJL, and C57BL/6 female mice at 6–8 weeks of age were pur-
chased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbour). Mice were vaccinated with 50 μ 
g 
 
DNA vaccine in saline without adjuvant by the i.m. route or with 1 μ 
g PIV 
 
vaccines with 100 μ 
g alum (Alhydrogel; Brenntag Biosector, Denmark) adjuvant 
by the i.m. or s.c. routes in a 100 μ 
l volume and were then challenged at week 4 by 
the i.v. route with 105 viral particles (102 plaque-forming units (PFU)) ZIKV-BR 
or ZIKV-PR. Animals were randomly allocated to groups. Immunologic and viro-
logic assays were performed blinded. Sample size was determined to achieve 80% 
power to detect significant differences in protective efficacy. All animal studies 
were approved by the BIDMC Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
 
(IACUC).
DNA vaccines. ZIKV strain BeH815744 (accession number KU365780) was 
used to design transgenes, which were produced synthetically. Sequences were 
optimized for enhanced transgene expression. Pre-membrane and envelope 
(prM-Env; defined as amino acids 216–794 of the polyprotein) or Env alone 
were cloned into the mammalian expression plasmid pcDNA3.1+ (Invitrogen). 
Deletion mutants lacked the transmembrane (ΔTM) or stem (Δ 
stem) 
regions of Env. A Kozak sequence and the Japanese encephalitis virus leader 
sequence were included24. Plasmids were produced with Machery-Nagel 
endotoxin-free gigaprep kits. Sequences were confirmed by double-stranded 
 
sequencing.
PIV vaccine. The ZIKV purified inactivated virus (PIV, also termed ZPIV) 
 
vaccine was produced at the Pilot Bioproduction Facility, Walter Reed Army 
Institute of Research, Silver Spring, MD, USA. The PIV vaccine was based on the 
Puerto Rican PRVABC59 isolate, which was obtained from the US Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention, Fort Collins, CO, USA. The Vero cells used for 
passage and vaccine production were a derivative of a certified cell line manufac-
tured at The Salk Institute, Swiftwater, PA. After inoculation, virus was collected on 
days 5 and 7, clarified by centrifugation and depth filter (0.45–0.2 μ 
m), and treated 
with benzonase. The viral harvest was concentrated with an ultrafilter followed 
by purification using Captocore chromatography resin. The purified ZIKV was 
then inactivated with formalin (0.05%) at 22 °C for 7 days. Following inactivation, 
formalin was removed by dialysis, and the antigen concentration was adjusted. The 
final PIV vaccine was assessed for infectivity by passage in Vero cells followed by 
plaque assays to demonstrate inactivation.
ZIKV challenge stocks. ZIKV stocks were provided by University of São Paulo, 
Brazil (Brazil ZKV2015; ZIKV-BR11) and the US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, USA (Puerto Rico PRVABC59; ZIKV-PR). Both strains were passage 
number 3. Low-passage-number Vero cells were then infected at a multiplicity 
of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU per cell. Supernatant was screened daily for viral 
titers and collected at peak growth. Culture supernatants were clarified by centrif-
ugation, and fetal bovine serum was added to 20% final concentration (v/v) and 
stored at − 
80 °C. The concentration and infectivity of the stocks were determined 
by RT–PCR and PFU assays. The viral particle to PFU ratio of both stocks was 
approximately 1,000.
RT–PCR. Cap genes of available ZIKV genomes were aligned using Megalign 
(DNAstar), and primers and probes to a highly conserved region were designed 
using primer express v3.0 (Applied Biosystems). Primers were synthesized by 
Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville) and probes by Biosearch Technologies 
(Petaluma). To assess viral loads, RNA was extracted from serum with a QIAcube 
HT (Qiagen). Reverse transcription and RT–PCR were performed as previously 
described18. The wild-type ZIKV BeH815744 Cap gene was used as a standard 
and was cloned into pcDNA3.1+ 
 vector, and the AmpliCap-Max T7 High Yield 
Message Maker Kit was used to transcribe RNA (Cellscript). RNA was purified 
using the RNA clean and concentrator kit (Zymo Research), and RNA quality and 
concentration was assessed by the BIDMC Molecular Core Facility. Log dilutions 
of the RNA standard were reverse-transcribed and included with each RT–PCR 
assay. Viral loads were calculated as virus particles per ml. Assay sensitivity was 
100 copies per ml. The infectivity of virus in peripheral blood from ZIKV chal-
lenged mice was confirmed by PFU assays.
PFU assay. Vero WHO cells were seeded in a MW6 plate to reach confluency at 
day 3. Cells were infected with log dilutions of ZIKV for 1 h and overlayed with 
agar. Cells were stained after 6 days of infection by neutral red staining. Plaques 
were counted, and titers were calculated by multiplying the number of plaques by 
the dilution and divided by the infection volume.
Western blot. To assess transgene expression from DNA vaccines, cell lysates 
obtained 48 h following lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) transient transfection 
of 293T cells were mixed with reducing sample buffer, heated for 5 min at 100 °C, 
cooled on ice, and run on a precast 4–15% SDS–PAGE gel (Biorad). Protein was 
transferred to PVDF membranes using the iBlot dry blotting system (Invitrogen), 
and the membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in PBS-T (Dulbeco’s phosphate 
buffered saline + 
 0.2% V/V Tween 20 + 
 5% W/V non-fat milk powder). Following 
overnight blocking, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with PBS-T contain-
ing a 1:5,000 dilution of mouse anti-ZIKV Env monoclonal antibody (BioFront 
Technologies). Membranes were then washed 3 times with PBS-T and incubated 
for 1 h with PBS-T containing a 1:1,000 dilution of rabbit anti-mouse horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Membranes were then washed 
3 times with PBS-T and developed using the Amersham ECL plus western blotting 
detection system (GE Healthcare).
ELISA. Mouse ZIKV Env ELISA kits (Alpha Diagnostic International) were used 
to determine endpoint antibody titers using a modified protocol. 96-well plates 
coated with ZIKV Env protein were first equilibrated at room temperature with 
300 μ 
l of kit working wash buffer for 5 min. 6 μ 
l of mouse serum was added to the 
top row, and threefold serial dilutions were tested in the remaining rows. Samples 
were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and plates washed 4 times. 100 μ 
l of 
anti-mouse IgG HRP-conjugate working solution was then added to each well 
and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Plates were washed 5 times, devel-
oped for 15 min at room temperature with 100 μ 
l of 3,3′ 
,5,5′ 
–tetramehylbenzidine 
(TMB) substrate, and stopped by the addition of 100 μ 
l of stop solution. Plates were 
 
analysed at 450 nm / 550 nm on a VersaMax microplate reader using Softmax Pro 
6.0 software (Molecular Devices). ELISA endpoint titers were defined as the highest 
reciprocal serum dilution that yielded an absorbance > 
2-fold over background 
values.
Neutralization assay. A high-throughput ZIKV microneutralization (MN) assay 
was developed for measuring ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies as a modi-
fied version of a qualified dengue virus microneutralization assay used in clinical 
dengue vaccine trials17. Briefly, serum samples were serially diluted threefold in 
96-well micro-plates, and 100 μ 
l of ZIKV-PR containing 100 PFU were added to 
100 μ 
l of each serum dilution and incubated at 35 °C for 2 h. Supernatants were then 
transferred to microtiter plates containing confluent Vero cell monolayers (World 
Health Organization, NICSC-011038011038). After incubation for 4 d, cells were 
fixed with absolute ethanol: methanol for 1 h at − 
20 °C and washed three times 
with PBS. The pan-flavivirus monoclonal antibody 6B6-C1 conjugated to HRP 
(6B6-C1 was a gift from J. T. Roehrig, CDC) was then added to each well, incubated 
at 35 °C for 2 h, and washed with PBS. Plates were washed, developed with 3,3′ 
,5,5′ 
–tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate for 50 min at room temperature, stopped 
with 1:25 phosphoric acid, and absorbance was read at 450 nm. For a valid assay, the 
average absorbance at 450 nm of three non-infected control wells had to be ≤ 0.5, 
and virus-only control wells had to be ≥ 0.9. Normalized absorbance values were 
calculated, and the MN50 titer was determined by a log mid-point linear regression 
model. The MN50 titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the serum dilution that 
neutralized ≥ 50% of ZIKV. Seropositivity was defined as a titer ≥ 1:10.
ELISPOT. ZIKV-specific cellular immune responses were assessed by IFNγ 
ELISPOT assays using pool of overlapping 15-amino-acid peptides covering the 
prM or Env proteins (JPT). 96-well multiscreen plates (Millipore) were coated 
overnight with 100 μ 
l per well of 10 μ 
g ml−1 anti-mouse IFNγ 
 (BD Biosciences) 
in endotoxin-free Dulbecco’s PBS (D-PBS). The plates were then washed three 
times with D-PBS containing 0.25% Tween 20 (D-PBS-Tween), blocked for 2 h 
with D-PBS containing 5% FBS at 37 °C, washed three times with D-PBS-Tween, 
rinsed with RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS to remove the Tween 20, and incu-
bated with 2 μ 
g ml−1 of each peptide and 5 × 
 105 mouse splenocytes in triplicate in 
100 μ 
l reaction mixture volumes. Following 18 h incubation at 37 °C, the plates were 
washed nine times with PBS-Tween and once with distilled water. The plates were 
then incubated with 2 μ 
g ml−1 biotinylated anti-mouse IFNγ 
 (BD Biosciences) for 
2 h at room temperature, washed six times with PBS-Tween, and incubated for 2 h 
with a 1:500 dilution of streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Southern Biotechnology 
Associates). Following five washes with PBS-Tween and one with PBS, the plates 
were developed with nitroblue tetrazolium-5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate 
chromogen (Pierce), stopped by washing with tap water, air dried, and read using 
an ELISPOT reader (Cellular Technology Ltd). The numbers of spot-forming cells 
(SFC) per 106 cells were calculated. The medium background levels were typically 
< 
15 SFC per 106 cells.
Intracellular cytokine staining. ZIKV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte 
responses were assessed using splenocytes and analysed by flow cytometry. Cells 
were stimulated for 1 h at 37 °C with 2 μ 
g ml−1 of overlapping 15-amino-acid 
 
peptides covering the prM or Env proteins (JPT). Following incubation, brefeldin-A 
 
and monensin (BioLegend) were added, and samples were incubated for 6 h at 
37 °C. Cells were then washed, stained, permeabilized with Cytofix/Cytoperm (BD 
Biosciences). Data was acquired using an LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) 
and analysed using FlowJo v.9.8.3 (Treestar). Monoclonal antibodies included: 
CD4 (RM4-5), CD8α 
 (53-6.7), CD44 (IM7), and IFNγ 
 (XMG1.2). Antibodies were 
purchased from BD Biosciences, eBioscience, or BioLegend. Vital dye exclusion 
(LIVE/DEAD) was purchased from Life Technologies.

IgG purification and adoptive transfer. Serum was collected from prM-Env 
DNA-vaccinated mice or naive mice, and polyclonal IgG was purified using 
protein G purification kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Varying amounts of puri-
fied IgG was infused by the i.v. route into naive recipient mice before ZIKV 
challenge.
CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocyte depletion. Anti-CD4 (GK1.5) and/or anti-CD8 
(2.43) (Bio X Cell) monoclonal antibodies were administered at doses of 500 μ 
g per 
mouse to prM-Env DNA vaccinated mice by the i.p. route on day − 
2 and day − 
1 
before ZIKV challenge. Antibody depletions were > 
99.9% efficient as determined 
by flow cytometry.
Statistical analyses. Analysis of virologic and immunologic data was performed 
using GraphPad Prism version 6.03 (GraphPad Software). Comparisons of groups 
was performed using t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Correlations were 
assessed by Spearman rank-correlation tests.
