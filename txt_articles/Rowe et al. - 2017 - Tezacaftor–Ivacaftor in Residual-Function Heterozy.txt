BACKGROUND
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR 
gene that lead to progressive respiratory decline. Some mutant CFTR proteins show 
residual function and respond to the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor in vitro, whereas 
ivacaftor alone does not restore activity to Phe508del mutant CFTR.
METHODS
We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3, crossover 
trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ivacaftor alone or in combination with 
tezacaftor, a CFTR corrector, in 248 patients 12 years of age or older who had 
cystic fibrosis and were heterozygous for the Phe508del mutation and a CFTR mu-
tation associated with residual CFTR function. Patients were randomly assigned to 
one of six sequences, each involving two 8-week intervention periods separated by 
an 8-week washout period. They received tezacaftor–ivacaftor, ivacaftor mono-
therapy, or placebo. The primary end point was the absolute change in the percent-
age of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) from the baseline 
value to the average of the week 4 and week 8 measurements in each intervention 
period.
RESULTS
The number of analyzed intervention periods was 162 for tezacaftor–ivacaftor, 157 
for ivacaftor alone, and 162 for placebo. The least-squares mean difference versus 
placebo with respect to the absolute change in the percentage of predicted FEV1 
was 6.8 percentage points for tezacaftor–ivacaftor and 4.7 percentage points for 
ivacaftor alone (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Scores on the respiratory domain 
of the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–Revised, a quality-of-life measure, also sig-
nificantly favored the active-treatment groups. The incidence of adverse events was 
similar across intervention groups; most events were mild or moderate in severity, 
with no discontinuations of the trial regimen due to adverse events for tezacaftor–
ivacaftor and few for ivacaftor alone (1% of patients) and placebo (<1%).
CONCLUSIONS
CFTR modulator therapy with tezacaftor–ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone was effica-
cious in patients with cystic fibrosis who were heterozygous for the Phe508del 
deletion and a CFTR residual-function mutation. (Funded by Vertex Pharmaceuti-
cals and others; EXPAND ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02392234.)

Tezacaftor–Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis
C
ystic fibrosis is a progressive, sys-
temic, life-limiting, autosomal recessive 
disease that is caused by reduced quantity 
or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane 
conductance regulator (CFTR) protein due to mu-
tations in the CFTR gene.1,2 Loss of chloride trans-
port activity due to defects in CFTR results in the 
accumulation of inspissated mucus in the air-
ways, loss of exocrine pancreatic function, im-
paired intestinal absorption, reproductive dysfunc-
tion, and elevated sweat chloride concentration.1,2
More than 270 CFTR mutations are known to 
cause cystic fibrosis.3 Disease severity and the rate 
of disease progression vary with mutation and are 
determined in part by the extent of chloride trans-
port loss associated with each. A substantial mi-
nority of CFTR mutations, affecting approximately 
5% of the overall population with cystic fibrosis, 
exhibit residual CFTR ion transport due to par-
tially retained CFTR expression and variably pre-
served channel gating or function.4-6 These “re-
sidual function” mutations cause cystic fibrosis 
with lung disease and a markedly reduced life 
expectancy, but the disease generally progresses 
more slowly than more common forms of cystic 
fibrosis.7 Without the use of newborn screening, 
patients with cystic fibrosis that is caused by 
these mutations often receive a diagnosis after 
early infancy and are more likely to have pancre-
atic sufficiency and sweat chloride concentra-
tions below 90 mmol per liter, indicating par-
tially preserved CFTR activity.4,8,9 In contrast, the 
common Phe508del CFTR mutation, which results 
in cellular degradation of the protein and causes 
severe dysfunction when homozygous, leads to 
early onset of cystic fibrosis and more rapid disease 
progression.7
Two complementary types of drugs have been 
developed with different mechanisms of action 
to increase CFTR-mediated anion secretion.10 CFTR 
potentiators, such as ivacaftor, increase the prob-
ability of CFTR channel opening at the cell sur-
face to enhance ion transport and are efficacious 
in treating gating mutations.11-13 CFTR correctors 
improve the cellular processing and trafficking of 
normal and mutated CFTR protein to increase 
the amount of functional CFTR at the cell surface. 
Ivacaftor-responsive CFTR mutations were identi-
fied on the basis of a clinical phenotype of residu-
al CFTR function (which indicates the presence 
of functional CFTR protein on the cell surface), 
in vitro data, and clinical case reports.14,15 The ad-
dition of the CFTR corrector tezacaftor was hy-
pothesized to enhance clinical benefit in patients 
with these mutations by increasing overall CFTR 
function; this combination treatment is particu-
larly important for restoring activity to those car-
rying two copies of the Phe508del CFTR mutation, 
as shown for the approved corrector–potentiator 
combination lumacaftor–ivacaftor, and may pro-
vide benefit to patients with other CFTR muta-
tions.6,16-19
Tezacaftor is an investigational CFTR corrector 
that, in combination with ivacaftor, has been 
shown to improve lung function and decrease 
sweat chloride concentrations in a phase 2 clini-
cal trial involving patients who were homozygous 
for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and patients 
who were heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR 
mutation and the G551D CFTR mutation.20 We 
hypothesized that this combination would also 
be beneficial in patients with cystic fibrosis caused 
by the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a residual-
function mutation.
This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled crossover trial evaluated the ef-
ficacy and safety of tezacaftor–ivacaftor combina-
tion therapy and ivacaftor monotherapy in patients 
12 years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis 
and were heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR 
mutation and a residual-function CFTR mutation.
Methods
Trial Design
This trial was a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, 
three-intervention crossover trial (VX14-661-108, 
also called EXPAND) involving patients 12 years 
of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were 
heterozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation 
and a second allele with a CFTR mutation with 
residual function. It was conducted at 86 sites in 
Australia, Europe, Israel, and North America from 
March 27, 2015, to February 16, 2017. (The trial 
protocol is available with the full text of this ar-
ticle at NEJM.org.) The residual-function muta-
tions, listed in Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix (available at NEJM.org), were identified 
by in vitro response to ivacaftor and population-
level clinical phenotype from epidemiologic data 
or published literature.3 This trial was designed 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tezacaftor 
(VX-661, Vertex Pharmaceuticals) in combination

with ivacaftor (VX-770, Vertex Pharmaceuticals) 
and of ivacaftor monotherapy in this patient popu-
lation with the use of an incomplete block design.
Each patient received two of the following 
three regimens: tezacaftor–ivacaftor combination 
therapy (100 mg of tezacaftor once daily and 150 
mg of ivacaftor every 12 hours), ivacaftor mono-
therapy (150 mg of ivacaftor every 12 hours), or 
placebo. This trial included a screening period of 
up to 6 weeks, two intervention periods of 8 weeks 
separated by a washout period of 8 weeks, and a 
safety follow-up visit. Patients were enrolled and 
stratified according to age at screening (<18 years 
vs. ≥18 years), the percentage of predicted forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at the screen-
ing visit (<70% vs. ≥70%), and type of residual-
function mutation (class V noncanonical splice 
mutation or class II to IV residual-function [mis-
sense] mutation) (Table S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). They were then randomly assigned 
(in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio) to one of six intervention 
sequences, as shown in Figure S1 in the Supple-
mentary Appendix.
Eligible patients who completed the week 24 
visit at the end of the second intervention period 
were offered the opportunity to enroll in an exten-
sion study (VX14-661-110; ClinicalTrials.gov num-
ber, NCT02565914). The trial protocol was ap-
proved by an independent ethics committee at 
each of the trial sites before trial initiation. All 
enrolled patients, or the parent or legal guardian 
(if applicable), provided written informed consent.
The trial sponsor (Vertex Pharmaceuticals) 
designed the protocol in collaboration with the 
authors. Local site investigators (listed in the Sup-
plementary Appendix) collected the data, which 
were analyzed by the sponsor. All the authors 
had full access to the trial data after the data 
were unblinded and made the decision to submit 
the manuscript for publication. The manuscript 
was written with medical writing support, which 
was funded by the sponsor, with critical review 
and input from all the authors. The authors vouch 
for the accuracy and completeness of the data and 
analyses and for the adherence of the trial to the 
protocol. Confidentiality agreements were in place 
between the sponsor and all the investigators par-
ticipating in this trial.
Trial Participants
Patients 12 years of age or older who were con-
firmed at the screening visit to be heterozygous 
for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a second 
allele with a residual-function CFTR mutation 
were eligible for inclusion if they had a percentage 
of predicted FEV1 at the time of screening that 
was 40 to 90% of the predicted normal values, 
stable lung disease, and a sweat chloride concen-
tration of at least 60 mmol per liter. If the sweat 
chloride concentration was less than 60 mmol 
per liter, documented evidence of chronic sino-
pulmonary disease was required (see the Meth-
ods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Patients were excluded if they had clinically 
significant laboratory abnormalities at screen-
ing (hemoglobin level <10 g per deciliter or ab-
normal liver or renal function); acute upper or 
lower respiratory infection, pulmonary exacer-
bation, or changes in therapy for pulmonary 
disease within 28 days before day 1 (first dose 
of trial regimen) of the trial; a history of solid-
organ or hematologic transplantation; recent par-
ticipation in an investigational drug study or 
use of a commercially available CFTR modula-
tor therapy, including ivacaftor or lumacaftor–
ivacaftor; or a history of any coexisting condi-
tion that might confound the results of the trial 
or pose an additional risk.
Trial Assessments
The primary end point was the absolute change 
in the percentage of predicted FEV1 from the 
baseline value to the average of the week 4 and 
week 8 measurements in each intervention pe-
riod. The key secondary end point was the abso-
lute change in the Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire–
Revised (CFQ-R) respiratory domain score from 
the baseline score to the average of the week 4 
and week 8 scores in each intervention period. 
Scores range from 0 to 100, with higher scores 
indicating a higher patient-reported quality of 
life with respect to respiratory status. Safety and 
side-effect profiles were assessed as a secondary 
objective on the basis of adverse events, clinical 
laboratory values, electrocardiography, vital signs, 
pulse oximetry, and spirometry. Additional sec-
ondary end points included the relative change 
in the percentage of predicted FEV1 and the ab-
solute change in the sweat chloride concentra-
tion (a measure of CFTR function), both from 
the baseline value to the average of the week 4 and 
week 8 measurements in each intervention period. 
Exploratory and additional supportive end points 
included the rate of pulmonary exacerbations, the

Tezacaftor–Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis
absolute change in the fecal elastase-1 level from 
the baseline value to the average of the week 4 
and week 8 measurements, the absolute change 
in the immunoreactive trypsinogen level from 
baseline to week 8, and the absolute change in the 
body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms 
divided by the square of the height in meters) 
from baseline to week 8.
Statistical Analysis
The percentage of predicted FEV1 was calculated 
according to the standards of Wang et al.21 (for 
female patients 12 to 15 years of age and male 
patients 12 to 17 years of age) or Hankinson et al.22 
(for female patients 16 years of age or older and 
male patients 18 years of age or older). The pri-
mary efficacy analysis, evaluation of the absolute 
change in the percentage of predicted FEV1 from 
the baseline value to the average of the week 4 
and week 8 measurements in the tezacaftor–iva-
caftor and placebo groups and in the ivacaftor 
monotherapy and placebo groups, was based on 
a mixed-effects model. The fixed effects in the 
model were intervention, intervention period, and 
percentage of predicted FEV1 at baseline, with 
patient as a random effect. Statistical analyses of 
all secondary end points were similar to that of 
the analysis of the primary efficacy end point 
(defined further in the Methods section in the 
Supplementary Appendix). The type I error rate 
for comparisons of the active treatments with 
placebo for the primary end point and key sec-
ondary end point was controlled by prespecify-
ing a gatekeeping approach. All safety analyses 
included patients who received at least one dose 
of the trial regimen, and all were based on data 
associated with each safety period, which extended 
from the first dose of the trial regimen in the in-
tervention period to the safety evaluation visit or 
safety follow-up visit, or to 28 days after the last 
dose in the intervention period for patients who 
did not have a safety evaluation visit or safety 
follow-up visit. The proposed sample size pro-
vided the trial with approximately 90% power 
for a significant difference to be observed be-
tween tezacaftor–ivacaftor and placebo for the 
primary end point. A carryover effect was not 
expected; therefore, the choice of a crossover 
design, the evaluation of efficacy by assessment 
of the change from trial baseline, and the pro-
posed analysis methods were considered to be 
appropriate.
Results
Participants
A total of 248 patients were enrolled and under-
went randomization. One patient assigned to pla-
cebo and 1 patient assigned to ivacaftor alone in 
period 1 were later deemed to be ineligible and 
did not receive the intervention. Of the remaining 
246 patients, 234 (95%) completed both inter-
vention periods, resulting in 481 periods that could 
be evaluated (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appen-
dix). Baseline demographic and clinical charac-
teristics of the patients in period 1 were similar 
among all groups (Table 1), with an overall mean 
(±SD) percentage of predicted FEV1 of 62.3±14.5%. 
The demographic and clinical characteristics of 
the patients in period 2 were similar to the char-
acteristics of the patients in period 1 (data not 
shown).
Clinical Efficacy
No carryover effects were seen between interven-
tion periods 1 and 2. Treatment with tezacaftor–
ivacaftor and ivacaftor alone resulted in significant 
benefits with respect to the primary end point, the 
absolute change in the percentage of predicted 
FEV1, as compared with placebo. The least-squares 
mean difference versus placebo from the baseline 
value to the average of the week 4 and week 8 
measurements was 6.8 percentage points (95% 
confidence interval [CI], 5.7 to 7.8) for tezacaftor–
ivacaftor and 4.7 percentage points (95% CI, 
3.7 to 5.8) for ivacaftor alone (P<0.001 for both 
comparisons) (Table 2). The difference between 
tezacaftor–ivacaftor and ivacaftor alone was sig-
nificant in favor of tezacaftor–ivacaftor (P<0.001) 
(Table 2).
Benefits with respect to the primary end point 
were observed for tezacaftor–ivacaftor and iva-
caftor alone as compared with placebo as early as 
day 15 and were maintained through week 8 of 
the trial period (Fig. 1). The results of the primary 
end point in prespecified subgroups consistently 
favored tezacaftor–ivacaftor and ivacaftor alone 
over placebo, regardless of age, sex, baseline lung 
function, geographic region, use of common cys-
tic fibrosis medications, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
colonization status, and type of residual-function 
mutation (Fig. 2).
Both tezacaftor–ivacaftor and ivacaftor alone 
had significant benefits with respect to the key 
secondary end point, the absolute change in the

CFQ-R respiratory domain score. The least-squares 
mean difference versus placebo from the baseline 
score to the average of the week 4 and week 8 
scores was 11.1 points (95% CI, 8.7 to 13.6) for 
tezacaftor–ivacaftor and 9.7 points (95% CI, 7.2 
to 12.2) for ivacaftor alone (P <0.001 for both com-
parisons) (Table 2). The percentage of patients who 
had a clinically important difference of 4 points 
or greater was 65% in the tezacaftor–ivacaftor 
group, 58% in the ivacaftor-alone group, and 33% 
in the placebo group.23 The difference in the CFQ-R 
respiratory domain score between tezacaftor–iva-
caftor and ivacaftor alone for either analysis was 
not significant.
Benefits were observed in both active-treat-
ment groups versus placebo for other secondary 
end points (Table 2). The gatekeeping approach 
was not applied to these analyses, and statistical 
significance cannot be claimed. Results for the 
relative change in the percentage of predicted FEV1 
were consistent with the findings from the pri-
mary analysis. Sweat chloride concentrations were 
lower (denoting better CFTR function) in patients 
receiving tezacaftor–ivacaftor or ivacaftor alone 
than in those receiving placebo (least-squares 
mean difference vs. placebo, −9.5 mmol per liter 
[95% CI, −11.7 to −7.3] for tezacaftor–ivacaftor 
and −4.5 mmol per liter [95% CI, −6.7 to −2.3] 
for ivacaftor alone) (Table 2), with a mean con-
centration of 59.4±29.2 mmol per liter in the

Tezacaftor–Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis
model for repeated measures) are shown in Ta-
ble S2 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Benefits with both tezacaftor–ivacaftor com-
bination therapy and ivacaftor monotherapy were 
seen in some exploratory and additional, prespeci-
fied end points. These included lower levels of 
immunoreactive trypsinogen (a marker of pan-
creatic function) than with placebo and a lower 
rate of pulmonary exacerbations that did not 
reach the level of statistical significance (Table 3; 
also see the Results section in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix). BMI was increased in both ac-
tive-treatment groups and the placebo group at 
week 8 (mean absolute change, 0.34 for tezacaftor–
ivacaftor, 0.47 for ivacaftor alone, and 0.18 for 
placebo); the differences versus placebo were not 
analyzed for statistical significance.
Safety
There were no deaths in the trial. The incidence 
of adverse events was similar in all three inter-
vention groups. The majority of patients had ad-
verse events that were considered either mild or 
moderate in severity. Four patients (2%) in the 
tezacaftor–ivacaftor group, eight (5%) in the iva-
caftor-alone group, and nine (6%) in the placebo 
group had grade 3 (severe) or grade 4 (life-threat-
ening) adverse events (Table 4). Adverse events led 
to discontinuation of the trial regimen for zero 
patients in the tezacaftor–ivacaftor group, two 
patients (1%) in the ivacaftor-alone group, and one 
(<1%) in the placebo group (Table 4; also see the 
Results section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Overall, the most common adverse events were 
typical of the clinical manifestations of cystic fi-
brosis. The most common events (≥10% incidence 
with any trial regimen), according to preferred 
term, were cough, infective pulmonary exacerba-
tion of cystic fibrosis, headache, and hemopty-
sis. In the tezacaftor–ivacaftor group, adverse 
events with both an incidence of at least 5% and 
an incidence that was at least 1 percentage point 
higher than in the placebo group were an increase 
in sputum production, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, 
and headache; in the ivacaftor-alone group, events 
that met these criteria were an increase in the 
blood level of creatine kinase and hemoptysis 
(Table 4). Two patients had serious adverse events 
of an increase in the blood level of creatine kinase 
with ivacaftor treatment that were considered by 
the treating investigator to be related to the trial 
regimen; no other patients had serious adverse 
events that were considered by the treating inves-
tigator to be related to active treatment. There 
were no clinically meaningful adverse trends in 
the levels of alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, total bilirubin (Table S6 in 
the Supplementary Appendix), or alkaline phos-
phatase.
Adverse events that were associated with respira-
tory events or respiratory symptoms were less com-
mon in the tezacaftor–ivacaftor group than in the

Tezacaftor–Ivacaftor in Cystic Fibrosis
Discussion
Using a crossover design, this phase 3 trial of 
combined CFTR corrector–potentiator treatment 
in patients with cystic fibrosis who were hetero-
zygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation and a 
second mutation associated with residual CFTR 
activity was able to evaluate two distinct con-
cepts: the effect of the potentiator ivacaftor on 
residual-function CFTR protein defects and the 
benefit of adding the investigational CFTR cor-
rector tezacaftor. Tezacaftor is a broad-acting 
CFTR corrector that facilitates the cellular pro-
cessing and trafficking of normal CFTR and mul-
tiple mutant CFTR forms, including the common 
Phe508del form, thereby increasing the amount 
of CFTR protein at the cell surface and resulting 
in increased chloride transport. Results showed 
important clinical benefit with both combina-
tion tezacaftor–ivacaftor treatment and treatment 
with ivacaftor alone. These findings confirm the 
benefits of potentiator therapy in patients with 
residual CFTR function mutations and the added 
benefit conferred by corrector–potentiator com-
bination therapy in this population.
The benefit with respect to spirometric mea-
surements that was observed with tezacaftor–iva-
caftor — and, to a lesser extent, with ivacaftor 
alone — was notable. Differences versus placebo 
were rapid in onset and were sustained at all trial 
visits, similar to those in other trials of effective 
CFTR modulators.12,15,17,24-26 Furthermore, differ-
ences versus placebo were consistent across all 
prespecified subgroup analyses.
Significant differences between the active-treat-
ment groups and the placebo group with respect to 
the CFQ-R respiratory domain score were ob-
served, indicating benefits with regard to respira-
tory health in patients with cystic fibrosis.23 The 
mean change with active treatment exceeded the 
known minimally clinically important difference, 
which is tightly linked to the expected benefits of 
treatment.27
Significant benefits with respect to pulmonary 
exacerbations and BMI were not expected in this 
population treated over a period of only 8 weeks 
and warrant further investigation in a longer, 
powered study. The findings related to levels of 
immunoreactive trypsinogen and fecal elastase-1, 
although exploratory, raise the possibility that 
CFTR modulation with tezacaftor–ivacaftor may 
have the potential to improve or preserve pan-
creatic function in some patients with residual 
function.
Overall, tezacaftor–ivacaftor treatment was 
safe, with no treatment discontinuations and no 
new risks identified. Tezacaftor–ivacaftor com-
bination therapy was specifically not associated 
with respiratory adverse events or acute, transient 
reductions in FEV1, as has been reported previ-
ously regarding CFTR modulator therapy with 
lumacaftor.13,17 This represents a potential advan-
tage of tezacaftor–ivacaftor combination therapy 
in patients with low baseline lung function or a 
component of reactive airway disease.
One of the major challenges in investigating 
new therapies for residual-function mutations is 
the relative rarity of these genotypes; hence, they 
were treated as a single group owing to their 
common epidemiologic characteristics, physio-
logical properties, and the propensity of mutant 
CFTR to respond to ivacaftor alone.3,28 The data 
with ivacaftor monotherapy validate previous clini-
cal case reports in a more controlled setting.14,15
Sweat chloride concentrations, a biomarker 
of CFTR modulation, decreased from baseline 
in both active-treatment groups, a finding that 
is consistent with the mechanism of action of 
CFTR modulation. The magnitude of change in 
sweat chloride concentration that was observed 
with ivacaftor in this trial was less than that in 
patients with gating mutations such as the 
G551D CFTR mutation, even though robust lung 
function and CFQ-R changes were observed in 
the present trial.12,14,29 One possible cause for 
this difference could be that the baseline sweat 
chloride concentration is lower in patients with 
residual-function mutations than in those with 
gating mutations. This equates to a smaller 
dynamic range over which improvement can 
occur.30,31 A second cause may be the inherent 
differential responsiveness of gating mutations 
and residual-function mutations to CFTR po-
tentiation. The varied cellular defects (processing 
and trafficking, gating, and conductance) that 
are associated with residual function would be 
expected to show smaller relative improvements 
in CFTR function with ivacaftor than would gat-
ing defects, because the principal effect of a po-
tentiator is to restore or augment channel gating.
Our findings show the safety and efficacy of 
tezacaftor–ivacaftor treatment in patients who 
had cystic fibrosis and were heterozygous for the 
Phe508del CFTR mutation and a second mutation

resulting in CFTR residual function; furthermore, 
although our findings also show the safety and 
efficacy of ivacaftor alone, the combination of 
tezacaftor and ivacaftor had greater efficacy. 
These results indicate that effective CFTR modu-
lator therapy can be beneficial in this group of 
patients. A companion trial (VX14-661-106) that 
is now reported in the Journal32 shows that patients 
who were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR 
mutation also benefited from tezacaftor–ivacaftor 
therapy. Collectively, these data underscore the 
benefit of tezacaftor–ivacaftor treatment in a broad 
population of patients with cystic fibrosis.
