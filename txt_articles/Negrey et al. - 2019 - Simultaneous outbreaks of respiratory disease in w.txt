ABSTRACT
Respiratory viruses of human origin infect wild apes across Africa, sometimes lethally. Here we report simultaneous
outbreaks of two distinct human respiratory viruses, human metapneumovirus (MPV; Pneumoviridae: Metapneumovirus)
and human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Paramyxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parainfluenza virus 3), in two
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) communities in the same forest in Uganda in December 2016 and January
2017. The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community
during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored
symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV
and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R0 of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in
infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher
virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both
viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009
variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse
zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts. These findings expand our knowledge of
human origin viruses threatening wild chimpanzees and suggest that such viruses might be differentiated by their
comparative epidemiological dynamics and pathogenicity in wild apes. Our results also caution against assuming
common causation in coincident outbreaks.

Introduction
Respiratory viruses of human origin have caused dis-
ease in wild apes across Sub-Saharan Africa and pose
a significant and growing threat to wild ape health
and conservation [1,2]. For example, respiratory dis-
ease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality
among chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) in Gombe
Stream National Park, Tanzania [3,4] and in Kibale
National Park, Uganda [5], two populations that have
been studied continuously for decades. Mortality
from anthroponotic respiratory pneumoviruses (family
Pneumoviridae) and paramyxoviruses (family Para-
myxoviridae) has been documented in western chim-
panzees (P. t. verus) in Cote d’Ivoire [1,6], eastern
chimpanzees (P. t. schweinfurthii) in Tanzania [7],
mountain
gorillas
(Gorilla
beringei
beringei)
in
Rwanda, lowland gorillas (G. g. gorilla) in Central Afri-
can Republic [8] and bonobos (P. paniscus) in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo [9]. Rhinovirus C
[10] and coronavirus OC43 [11] of human origin
have also caused chimpanzee mortality in Uganda
and
mild
respiratory
disease
in
Cote
d’Ivoire,
respectively.
Biological similarities between humans and apes
predispose them to cross-species pathogen trans-
mission [12], and habitat alterations may exacerbate
inter-species contact and anthroponotic transmission
risk [2]. Although simultaneous infections of apes
and people with the same respiratory virus have rarely
been confirmed directly [8,11], viruses that are rela-
tively benign in humans can cause lethal outbreaks in
ape populations, indicating lack of resistance in apes.
Suitable prevention strategies have included improved
hygiene and sanitation [13], reduced human visitation
[14] and large-scale vaccination of apes (if effective vac-
cines someday become available) [15]. Such policies

 could also benefit human public health by reducing
zoonotic transmission risk [16,17].
Here, we report simultaneous outbreaks of respirat-
ory disease in two nearby chimpanzee communities in
Uganda, caused by two distinct negative-sense RNA
viruses of human origin. The outbreaks occurred
from December 2016 to February 2017 in the Ngogo
and Kanyawara chimpanzee communities in Kibale
National Park [18] (Figure S1). Only 10 km apart, the
communities are interconnected by contiguous moist
evergreen forest, separated by only one intervening
chimpanzee community that is not currently studied,
and both communities generally experience low mor-
tality rates [19,20].
Although outbreaks of respiratory disease in wild
chimpanzees are common, their causes often remain
undiagnosed [10]. Fresh carcasses are often not recov-
ered, and the remoteness of field sites complicates
sample storage and analysis. Non-invasive diagnostics
(usually from feces) have proven highly informative
[6], but negative results in such cases are inconclusive
[10]. In the present case, rapid recovery of carcasses,
the presence of trained veterinarians and the avail-
ability of basic field laboratory capabilities on site pro-
vided
an
opportunity
for
etiologic
diagnoses.
Furthermore, coordinated, prospective collection of
observational data between the two sites offered an
unusual chance to compare the clinical and epidemio-
logic features of the outbreaks directly.
Results
From 31 December 2016 to 8 February 2017, the
Ngogo chimpanzee community of Kibale National
Park, Uganda (Figure S1), experienced an outbreak of
severe respiratory disease. During the same period,
the nearby Kanyawara community (Figure S1) also
experienced a respiratory disease outbreak. At the
onset of the epidemics, Ngogo community consisted
of 205 chimpanzees from <1 year to 67 years old,
and Kanyawara community consisted of 55 chimpan-
zees from <1 year to 51 years old. Epidemic curves
(Figure 1) show that the Ngogo and Kanyawara out-
breaks each occurred in a single phase, with most
cases occurring in January 2017. At Ngogo, 43.8% of
chimpanzees observed between 3 December 2016 and
28 February 2017 exhibited respiratory signs. At
Kanyawara, 69.1% of chimpanzees observed during
the same period exhibited respiratory signs. At
Ngogo, 25 chimpanzees (12.2%) died during the out-
break period (Figure 1). In contrast, no chimpanzees
at Kanyawara died during the outbreak period, with
the exception of a female recovering from disease
who
died
following
conspecific
aggression
(see
below). Respiratory signs consisted of coughing, sneez-
ing, dyspnea, and nasal exudate; other signs included
lethargy, immobility, and dramatic loss of body con-
dition (Figure S2).
Epidemiologic modelling of the Ngogo and Kanya-
wara outbreaks (Table 1 and Figure S3) yielded daily
transmission rate estimates of 1.13 and 0.338, and dur-
ations of infectivity of 1.12 and 4.55 days, respectively.
These parameters yielded basic reproductive numbers
(R0) of 1.27 and 1.48 for Ngogo and Kanyawara,
respectively. These are similar to values estimated
from an outbreak of rhinovirus C in Kanyawara in
2013 (Table 1) during which 8.9% of chimpanzees
died, and to published values for the human “common
cold” [10]. However, 95% confidence limits around
these estimates were non-overlapping for daily trans-
mission rates of all three outbreaks and duration of
infectivity and R0 in Ngogo (both lower than in Kanya-
wara in 2013 or 2016/2017).
Risk factor analysis (Table S2) showed that age
significantly predicted morbidity at both Ngogo
(χ2 = 10.097,
DF = 3,
p = 0.018)
and
Kanyawara
(χ2 = 12.154, DF = 3, p = 0.007). In both communities,
respiratory signs were least frequently observed
among infants and increased through successive age
categories. Sex did not affect morbidity or mortality
at Ngogo, but females were significantly more likely
to exhibit respiratory signs at Kanyawara than were
males (χ2 = 6.310, DF = 1, p = 0.012). At Ngogo, age
predicted mortality (χ2 = 19.153, DF = 3, p < 0.001),
with mortality highest among infants (OR 5.01,
95% CI: 1.53–19.56) and individuals ≥30 years old
(OR 3.86, 95% CI: 1.16–15.15), compared to inter-
mediate ages.
At Ngogo, the carcass of a 20-year-old female chim-
panzee was recovered immediately after the onset of
respiratory signs and subsequent death. Post-mortem
analysis of this individual revealed consolidation of
the dependent lobes of both lungs and a serosangui-
nous pericardial effusion but no other gross pathologic
abnormalities (Figure S4). At Kanyawara, the carcass of
a 22-year-old female chimpanzee was
recovered
approximately 10 days after having recovered from

 different viral etiologies for each community (Table 2).
Metapneumovirus (MPV, Pneumoviridae: Metapneu-
movirus) was detected in 7 of 11 individuals (63.6%)
from Ngogo chimpanzees exhibiting clinical signs
during, but not before, the outbreak period (Fisher’s
exact P = 0.0030). Human respirovirus 3 (HRV3; Para-
myxoviridae; Respirovirus, formerly known as parai-
nfluenza virus 3) was detected in 5 of 14 individuals
(35.7%) from Kanyawara chimpanzees exhibiting clini-
cal signs during, but not before, the outbreak period
(Fisher’s exact P = 0.0005). Adenoviruses (Adenoviri-
dae) were present in samples from both Ngogo
(36.4%) and Kanyawara (78.6%) but showed no associ-
ation with the outbreak period (Fisher’s exact P =
0.4545 and 0.5291, respectively) and have been pre-
viously characterized in this population at comparable
frequencies [10]. Enteroviruses (Picornaviridae) were
also present at low frequency in samples from both
communities, similarly showed no association with
the outbreak period (Fisher’s exact P = 1.000 in both
cases), and have also been previously characterized in
this population at comparable frequencies [10].
Metagenomic analysis of respiratory tract swab
samples from the chimpanzee examined postmortem
at Ngogo yielded 16,107,924 reads after trimming, of
which 27,393 assembled to yield a coding-complete
MPV genome of 13,230 bases with average coverage
of 196, consistent with the Luminex results described
above. This genome (GenBank accession number
MH428626) was most similar (98.69%) to a 2010
human-derived variant from Brazil (GenBank acces-
sion number MG431250). Intriguingly, the virus was
nearly as similar (98.67%) to a variant from a mountain
gorilla from Rwanda in 2008 (GenBank accession
number HM197719) detected during a lethal outbreak
[21]. MPV RNA was present in all sections of the res-
piratory tract, including the lung parenchyma, with the
proportion of viral sequence reads declining monoto-
nically from the upper to the lower respiratory tract
(Figure S5). Sequencing of a 480 nucleotide portion
of the viral F gene from fecal samples was successful
for three other Luminex-positive chimpanzees at
Ngogo (AB, MI and WI; Table 2), yielding identical
sequences within this variable genomic region (Gen-
Bank accession numbers MH428628- MH428630).
By contrast, neither HRV3 nor any other virus was
detected in the respiratory tract of the chimpanzee that
died at Kanyawara, likely reflecting prior infection and
viral clearance. A coding-complete HRV3 genome
(15,407 bases) was therefore reconstructed from a
fecal sample from this same individual collected
when she was coughing approximately 2 weeks earlier,
using PCR with virus-specific primers and Sanger
sequencing (Table S1). This genome (GenBank acces-
sion number MH428627) was most similar (99.38%)
to a 2009 human-derived variant from the USA (Gen-
Bank accession number KY674929). Sequencing of a
variable
and
epidemiologically
informative
348-
nucleotide portion of the viral F gene from fecal
samples was successful for three other Luminex-posi-
tive chimpanzees at Kanyawara (AL, AN and AZ;
Table 2), yielding identical sequences within this geno-
mic region (GenBank accession numbers MH428631–
MH428633). Re-analysis of respiratory tract metage-
nomic data from this individual and the individual
from Ngogo revealed that a small proportion of reads
in the upper respiratory tracts of both animals (0.05%
and 0.16%, respectively) mapped to the reference gen-
ome of Staphylococcus pneumoniae (GenBank acces-
sion
number
NC_003098),
which
can
infect
chimpanzees secondarily during viral respiratory dis-
ease outbreaks [9,22], indicating the presence of this
or a related bacterium; however no reads mapped to
this organism in the lungs of either animal.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed MPV from the
Ngogo outbreak to sort within a sub-clade of subtype
B2 [23] viruses from Brazil, Peru, Rwanda and the
USA (Figure 2). This sub-clade contains recently col-
lected viruses (2009–2015), including the mountain
gorilla variant from Rwanda. The MPV variant from
Ngogo belongs to a different subtype than a previously
reported B1 virus from a chimpanzee outbreak in Tan-
zania [7], and it is less closely related to a previously
reported B2 subtype from a chimpanzee outbreak in
Cote d’Ivoire [1] than to other variants within its sub-
clade, including the gorilla-derived variant, based on
the available 867 nucleotide region of the viral P gene
(GenBank accession numbers EU240454-EU240456;
not shown).
Phylogenetic analysis revealed HRV3 from the
Kanyawara outbreak to sort within a sub-clade of
highly similar human-derived viruses from Peru and
the USA collected between 2006 and 2015 (no more
recently than other sub-clades; Figure 2). Notably,
HRV3 from Kanyawara was divergent from viruses
from other non-human primates, including viruses
from wild Zambian baboons (Papio cynocephalus)
[24] and simian agent 10, originally isolated from a
blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis) in South Africa
[25].
Discussion
Outbreaks of severe and sometimes lethal respiratory
disease are common in chimpanzees across Sub-
Saharan Africa, but their causes often remain undeter-
mined [2,10]. Consequently, and because of differences
in field protocols among research sites, it has proven
difficult to compare these outbreaks directly. The
simultaneity of the two 2016/2017 outbreaks at
Ngogo and Kanyawara, coupled with coordinated
data and sample collection efforts between the two
sites, allowed a rare direct comparison to be made.
Analyses demonstrate that the two viruses displayed
142
J. D. Negrey et al.
 different pathogenicities and different epidemiological
dynamics in the two chimpanzee communities.
MPV at Ngogo caused substantially higher mortality
than HRV3 at Kanyawara, despite causing apparently
lower morbidity. However, the estimated daily trans-
mission rate and duration of infectivity of MPV at
Ngogo differed from corresponding values for HRV3
at Kanyawara (Table 1), suggesting that, despite com-
parable R0 values, the viruses displayed different epide-
miologic dynamics. Higher mortality due to MPV in
infants and older adults compared to intermediate
age categories is congruent with data from humans,
where infants, young children and older adults are
most susceptible to severe clinical manifestations of
MPV infection [26,27], as well as with demographic
data from prior MPV outbreaks in chimpanzees [1,6].
Neither virus was detected in chimpanzees immedi-
ately prior to the outbreaks (Table 2). MPV was
detected in 63.6% of affected Ngogo chimpanzees
sampled during the outbreak, and HRV3 was detected
in 35.7% of affected Kanyawara chimpanzees sampled
during the outbreak. Viral sequences from affected
individuals were identical within the variable region
sequenced. MPV and HRV3 were therefore likely
single-origin causes of their respective epidemics.
Adenoviruses and enteroviruses were present both
before and during the outbreaks at statistically indistin-
guishable (AdV) and low (EV) frequencies. Adeno-
viruses occur in both healthy and ill wild apes [28–
31] and in chimpanzees during respiratory outbreaks
[32], including at Kanyawara [10], leading to debate
about their etiologic role; however, our results support
previous conclusions that these viruses are most likely
benign. Our results support a similar conclusion for
enteroviruses, with the notable exceptions of polio
virus [3,33] and rhinoviruses [10], which can cause
deadly disease in chimpanzees.
We note that, at the time of the outbreaks, the
Ngogo and Kanyawara epidemics were assumed to
have the same cause, with concomitant fears that an
infectious agent was spreading rapidly across Kibale
National Park. Moreover, avian influenza had recently
been reported in waterfowl in Lake Victoria, on the
other side of Uganda [34]. Our results highlight how
heightened vigilance for emerging infectious diseases
can sometimes lead to erroneous inferences. Common
environmental drivers (e.g. weather, human visitation
patterns) may precipitate simultaneous outbreaks of
distinct anthroponotic viruses in wild apes, creating
the appearance of a single disease with a seasonal

of respiratory viruses between chimpanzee commu-
nities is probably uncommon, despite high rates of
transmission within chimpanzee communities. Chim-
panzees
from
neighbouring
communities
rarely
interact [33], which may limit opportunities for inter-
community transmission even of highly contagious
microbes.
MPV and HRV3 both represent significant burdens
to global public health [35]. MPV infection in humans

 causes coughing, nasal discharge and weight loss [36];
in non-human models signs are often more severe than
for other related viruses [37]. MPV also causes clinical
disease in experimentally infected chimpanzees [38]
and severe and sometimes lethal outbreaks of respirat-
ory disease in wild chimpanzees and gorillas, often with
similar demographic patterns of infection as we
describe herein [1,6,7,21], as does a related virus, res-
piratory syncytial virus (Pneumoviridae, Orthopneu-
movirus)
[1].
Our
results
show
that
this
comparatively high virulence of MPV is recapitulated
in naturally infected chimpanzees.
HRV3 causes respiratory disease and asthma exacer-
bation in people worldwide, especially in children and
the elderly, but it is less virulent than MPV [39]. HRV3
has a wide host range, including primates, ruminants
and rodents [40]. Simian agent 10, first isolated in
1963 from an apparently healthy blue monkey [41],
was later identified as HRV3 and attributed to anthro-
ponotic transmission [25]. HRV3 has been detected in
the respiratory tracts of apparently healthy wild yellow
baboons in Zambia [24]. Experimental infection of
marmosets (Saguinus mystax) with HRV3 causes
acute and transmissible disease [42], but experimental
infection of other primates, including rhesus macaques
(Macaca mulatta) and chimpanzees [43], is milder.
Our results mirror these findings and, more generally,
show that some negative-sense RNA respiratory
viruses of human origin cause only mild and self-limit-
ing infections in wild chimpanzees.
We cannot exclude the role of other co-infecting
pathogens in modulating the pathogenicity of MPV
and HRV3 in our study populations. For example,
HRV3 can cause upper respiratory disease and predis-
pose chimpanzees to invasive pneumococcal infection
[44], and the bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae
co-occurs with human metapneumoviruses and respir-
atory syncytial viruses in both wild and in captive apes
[9,22]. Our finding of a low percentage of metagenomic
sequence reads matching S. pneumoniae (or a related
bacterium) in the upper respiratory tracts of both
necropsied individuals, but not in their lungs, supports
the notion that wild chimpanzees host microbes that
could easily invade the lower respiratory tract following
primary viral infection. Population surveys of endemic
microbes and serologic assessments of prior exposure
to agents that might predispose chimpanzees to infec-
tion or enhance pathogenesis could prove informative.
Clinical signs in Ngogo chimpanzees were congru-
ent with those in severely infected humans [36]. One
adult female at Ngogo (“Kidman”) has exhibited per-
sistent wheezing since the outbreak; in human children
suffering severe MPV infections, subsequent wheezing
episodes are not uncommon [45]. Post-mortem analy-
sis of one individual at Ngogo revealed surprisingly lit-
tle gross pathology of the respiratory tract, consistent
with acute infection and rapid death, and MPV was
recovered from all sections of that individual’s respirat-
ory tract, including the lung parenchyma (Figures S4
and S5). In contrast, post-mortem analysis of an indi-
vidual at Kanyawara revealed advanced respiratory
tract pathology, consistent with longer term infection
(Figure S5), but we did not recover HRV3 from this
individual’s respiratory tract despite recovering a com-
plete HRV3 genome from this same individual’s feces
collected approximately 2 weeks earlier. This individual
had likely recovered from the initial viral challenge,
cleared the virus, and perhaps acquired a secondary
bacterial infection [9,22]. Notably, both individuals
had pericardial effusions, which in humans are rare
but serious sequellae of certain viral infections [46].
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that MPV from
Ngogo and HRV3 from Kanyawara are each closely
related to globally circulating human viruses, indicat-
ing independent anthroponotic sources for both
viruses. Apparent geographic associations in these phy-
logenies likely represent bias in available sequence data
(e.g. high representation of viruses from Peru and the
USA; Table S3). The Ngogo MPV variant clusters
within a sub-clade of viruses that is more recent
(2008–2017) than other sub-clades, perhaps reflecting
antigenic replacement of MPV strains over time. Nota-
bly, the Ngogo variant is very similar to a virus from a
fatal infection of a mountain gorilla in Rwanda in 2009
[21]. This particular viral lineage may thus have a pro-
pensity for infecting apes, or it may simply circulate
widely in East Africa. The virus is divergent, however,
from previously described, lethal viruses from wild
chimpanzees in Tanzania [7] and Cote d’Ivoire [1],
indicating that multiple MPV variants can infect and
kill wild chimpanzees.
The pathways by which these viruses entered chim-
panzees from humans remain vexingly obscure. People
frequent the habitats of both chimpanzee communities
for research and associated activities (not solely
focused on chimpanzees) and to travel or collect forest
products [47]. Tourism is sometimes cited as a risk for
anthroponotic transmission of viruses to great apes and
helps inform current International Union for the Con-
servation of Nature (IUCN) recommendations for pre-
venting such transmission, such as visitor vaccination
requirements, minimum observation distances, alco-
hol-based sanitizing gel and facemasks [13]. However,
neither Ngogo nor Kanyawara is a tourism site. Ngogo
is bordered by a tourism site (Kanyanchu) receiving
thousands of visitors each year, but there were no
reports of a concurrent respiratory disease outbreak
in the Kanyanchu chimpanzees, although similar
events have occurred there at other times. At Gombe
National Park in Tanzania, provisioning chimpanzees
with bananas (a discontinued practice) was, along
with season, the strongest predictor of chimpanzee res-
piratory signs [48], which affected between 0% and 9%
of chimpanzees per month between 2005 and 2012 [4].

 However, neither the Ngogo nor the Kanyawara chim-
panzees are provisioned, and biosecurity measures
based on IUCN recommendations [13] for visitors to
both sites are in place. At Kanyawara, data over 22
years show a seasonal pattern of respiratory illness in
chimpanzees, typically peaking in March, but no corre-
lation between clinical signs in chimpanzees and seaso-
nal patterns of respiratory illness in humans living
nearby [5]. The role of other species in transmitting
these viruses from humans to chimpanzees is also
unclear. Kibale National Park contains a diversity of
primate species and social groups, none of which
were observed with respiratory signs at the time of
the outbreaks, but complex patterns of cross-species
transmission from humans to chimpanzees cannot be
discounted. Such possibilities could be investigated
through broad sampling of people (especially research
staff) and wildlife during future outbreaks, including
serologic assessments of prior exposure.
Overall, these findings broaden our understanding
of human viruses that can cause disease in wild chim-
panzees and show that their clinical manifestations can
vary markedly. Our study also shows that epidemiolo-
gical analyses, enabled by prospective, coordinated
observational data collection, may be able to dis-
tinguish among viruses based on early-stage infection
patterns. If so, “real-time” epidemiologic analyses
would be a valuable complement to molecular diagnos-
tic testing, in that they could help guide response strat-
egies as epidemics progress. Epidemiologic analyses
could also inform future monitoring efforts to detect
and minimize the impact of anthroponotic trans-
mission events on wild ape populations.
Materials and methods
Ethics statement
The study was observational and non-invasive. Proto-
cols were approved by Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees (IACUC) of Harvard University (pro-
tocol 96-03) and University of New Mexico (protocol
14-101186-MCC) and were exempt by Boston Univer-
sity’s and the University of Michigan’s IACUC. Proto-
cols followed the Weatherall Report, NIH Guide for the
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, USDA Animal
Welfare Act, Institute for Laboratory Animal Research
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, US
Public Health Service and National Academies of
Sciences National Research Council, and US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
Observational data
During the outbreaks, trained field assistants collected
individual-level observational data on the chimpanzees
daily. Chimpanzees in both the Ngogo and Kanyawara
communities are individually identifiable, making such
data possible to collect. We compiled these data into
measures of clinical signs (coughing or sneezing,
further classified as mild or severe), and observation
time per chimpanzee. We estimated dates of mortality
events as the midpoint of the last date a chimpanzee
was seen alive and the first date it was absent from a
group containing frequent associates, including depen-
dent offspring.
Epidemiological analyses
To infer epidemiological transmission parameters, we
constructed two SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed)
mathematical models – one for each community – fol-
lowing Althaus [49], fitting curves to cumulative inci-
dence data using the Nelder and Mead optimization
algorithm in the optim package in R, version 3.3.2
[50]. For both communities, we assumed free admix-
ture and did not incorporate heterogeneity of social
interaction to minimize model complexity, as we did
previously for a rhinovirus C outbreak in Kanyawara
[10].
We analysed risk factors for morbidity and mor-
tality using a generalized linear model (GLM) with
binomial distribution and log-link function g in R
[51]. Age, sex and their interaction were included as
predictor
variables,
and
observation
hours
were
included as a control variable. Age was modelled as a
categorical variable with four levels: infants (<5
years), juveniles (5–14.9 years), adults (15–29.9 years)
and older (≥30 years). At Ngogo, where mortality
occurred, 13 individuals not observed with clinical
signs during the outbreak period that disappeared
were coded as having died and as positive for respirat-
ory signs. Because none of these individuals were ado-
lescent
females
(the
only
age-sex
category
of
chimpanzee that can migrate between communities),
their sudden disappearance (and the fact that they
have never been seen since) confirms that they had,
in fact, died.
Molecular diagnostics
We collected fecal samples from individual chimpan-
zees in both communities during the outbreak period.
Two millilitres of feces were placed immediately into
RNAlater buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA, USA) at a 1:1 ratio, homogenized and stored at
−20°C until exported to the United States. Paired
fecal samples were available from 25 clinically ill chim-
panzees (11 from Ngogo and 14 from Kanyawara)
during and before (fourth quarter of 2016) the out-
break period, and we tested these for a suite of respir-
atory
pathogens
using
the
NxTAG
Respiratory
Pathogen Panel (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX,
USA) as previously described [10], which tests for
146

 influenza virus A (multiple subtypes), human respirat-
ory syncytial viruses A and B, coronaviruses (multiple
subtypes), human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enter-
ovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1–4, boca-
virus, and the bacterial pathogens Chlamydophila
pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
Necropsies were performed on two chimpanzees
recovered immediately after death (the only two car-
casses recovered, despite extensive effort) by trained
veterinarians wearing appropriate personal protective
equipment. One chimpanzee from Ngogo died on 16
January 2017 (“Stella,” a 20-year-old female) and the
other chimpanzee from Kanyawara died on January
13, 2017 (“Rwanda,” a 22-year-old female). In the latter
case, the individual had been coughing 10 days earlier
and was attacked repeatedly by conspecifics while still
weak; the resulting trauma appeared to be the immedi-
ate cause of death. Samples (sterile swabs with plastic
shafts and Dacron tips) were collected from the nose,
larynx, trachea, bronchi and lung parenchyma of
both individuals and stored in 0.25 ml RNAlater
buffer at −20°C. Swabs were homogenized and total
RNA was extracted and converted to cDNA libraries
in the field, then prepared for sequencing on an Illu-
mina MiSeq instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA,
USA) using 300 bp paired-end read chemistry as pre-
viously described [10].
Virus genome sequencing and phylogenetic
analyses
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Sanger sequen-
cing were used to complete viral genomes and to
characterize viruses detected by Luminex assay in
fecal samples (Table S1). To infer phylogenetic
relationships among the two chimpanzee viruses and
published viral sequences, we analysed full genome
alignments of all available viruses in GenBank (align-
ment lengths 13,234 and 15,330 positions, respectively)
using PhyML 3.0 [52] with 1000 bootstrap replicates of
the data to assess statistical confidence in clades, and
we displayed the resulting trees using FigTree 1.4.3
[53,54].
