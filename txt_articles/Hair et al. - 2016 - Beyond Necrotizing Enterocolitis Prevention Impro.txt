Abstract
Objective: The aim of this study was to compare outcomes of infants pre and post initiation of a feeding
protocol providing an exclusive human milk–based diet (HUM).
Materials and Methods: In a multicenter retrospective cohort study, infants with a birth weight <1,250 g who
received a bovine-based diet (BOV) of mother’s own milk fortified with bovine fortifier and/or preterm formula
were compared to infants who received a newly introduced HUM feeding protocol. Infants were excluded if
they had major congenital anomalies or died in the first 12 hours of life. Data were collected 2–3 years prior to
and after introduction of an exclusive HUM diet. Primary outcomes were necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and
mortality. Secondary outcomes included late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), and broncho-
pulmonary dysplasia (BPD).
Results: A total of 1,587 infants were included from four centers in Texas, Illinois, Florida, and California.
There were no differences in baseline demographics or growth of infants. The HUM group had significantly
lower incidence of proven NEC (16.7% versus 6.9%, p < 0.00001), mortality (17.2% versus 13.6%, p = 0.04),
late-onset sepsis (30.3% versus 19.0%, p < 0.00001), ROP (9% versus 5.2%, p = 0.003), and BPD (56.3% versus
47.7%, p = 0.0015) compared with the BOV group.
Conclusions: Extremely premature infants who received an exclusive HUM diet had a significantly lower
incidence of NEC and mortality. The HUM group also had a reduction in late-onset sepsis, BPD, and ROP. This
multicenter study further emphasizes the many benefits of an exclusive HUM diet, and demonstrates multiple
improved outcomes after implementation of such a feeding protocol.
Introduction
P
rematurity remains the leading cause of neonatal
mortality in the United States. One of the most difficult
aspects of the management of the premature infant is related
to nutrition and gastrointestinal complications such as nec-
rotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and intestinal perforation. The
development and progression of NEC is known to cause
significant morbidity and mortality. However, the exact
pathophysiology of NEC has yet to be defined, thus making
preventive strategies more difficult.1–3 Epidemiology shows
that the highest-risk infants are those weighing <1,250 g, born
at a gestational age of <28 weeks, and with congenital
heart defects.1 It has been long established that breast milk
is the best source of nutrition for all infants when it is safe and
available. The continued gain in knowledge over the years
has led the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and
Surgeon General to recommend in published statements the
use of human milk (HM), including donor milk when needed,
for premature infants.4,5
Over the last 10 years, the implementation of donor HM for
very low birth weight (VLBW) infants has become more

 widespread. Hair et al. demonstrated that the use of an ex-
clusive human milk–based diet (HUM) using mother’s own
milk, donor HM, and a donor HM-derived fortifier was safe
and did not hinder growth of infants.6
There may be multiple benefits in using HM for premature
infants such as lower rates of NEC, late-onset sepsis, feeding
tolerance, and mortality, along with improved neurodeve-
lopmental outcomes.7–11 Sullivan et al. demonstrated, in a
prospective, randomized trial, that the use of breast milk and
donor HM with a donor HM-derived fortifier was associated
with a reduction in NEC.12 Given the increasing research
showing reduction in NEC rates with an exclusive HUM diet,
this study sought to evaluate this trend in multiple centers.
The objectives were to determine whether these trends hold
true across four Level 3 Neonatal Intensive Care Units at
different hospitals in the United States and to evaluate other
important outcomes for extremely premature infants.
Materials and Methods
In a multicenter retrospective cohort study, infants who
received a bovine-based diet (BOV) of mother’s milk forti-
fied with bovine fortifier and/or preterm formula were com-
pared to infants who received an exclusive HUM diet feeding
protocol. Infants with a birth weight (BW) <1,250 g were
included. Infants were excluded if they had major congenital
anomalies, died within the first 12 hours of admission, or if
they were transferred in from an outside hospital after 1 week
of age. Data were collected before and after the introduction
of a HUM diet. For each institution below, the specific
feeding protocol and time frame for data collection are de-
tailed. In the BOV group, infants preferentially received
mother’s milk fortified with bovine fortifier over formula.
Primary outcomes were NEC and mortality. Secondary out-
comes included late-onset sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity
(ROP), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), patent ductus
arteriosus (PDA), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), venti-
lator days, and postmenstrual age (PMA) at discharge.
Baylor College of Medicine
The Institutional Review Board of Baylor College of
Medicine and Affiliated Hospitals in Houston, TX, approved
this retrospective study. Infants were grouped based on the
year of birth: 2006–2008 (BOV) and 2009–2012 (HUM).
Information for coding of variables was obtained from the
Vermont Oxford Network (VON).
The HUM feeding protocol was established at Texas Chil-
dren’s Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) in 2009
and was provided to infants <1,250 g BW. Infants received
mother’s own milk, donor HM, and a donor HM-derived for-
tifier (HUM). If mother’s milk was not available then donor
HM was provided after obtaining assent from the family.
Enteral feeds were started with trophic feeds of 20mL/kg/day
for 3 days. Feeds were then advanced by 20mL/kg/day as
tolerated to reach a total volume goal of 140–160 mL/kg/
day. Pasteurized donor HM-derived fortifier, Prolact+H2MF�
(Prolacta Bioscience, Industry, CA) was added once feeds
reached 60mL/kg/day for an additional 4 Cal/oz. At 100 mL/
kg/day, fortification was increased to provide an additional 6
Cal/oz. If weight gain was <15g/kg/day, fortification was in-
creased to 8 Cal/ozand then 10Cal/oz. Infants received a HUM
diet until 34 weeks PMA. Prior to 2009, a feeding protocol was
followed with similar advancement of the volume of feeds, but
infants received mother’s milk fortified with bovine fortifier
and/orpreterm formula (BOV).Fortificationdid not occur until
the volume of feeds was 100 mL/kg/day in the BOV group.
Good Samaritan San Jose
The retrospective analysis was approved by the Good
Samaritan Hospital (GSH) Institutional Review Board. In-
itiation of the HUM diet began in August 2010, and data were
collected until March 2012. The pre-protocol period of BOV
diet was December 2008–July 2010 (20 months of data col-
lection for each period).
The HUM diet was used for all VLBW infants (BW
<1,000 g). Infants were fed mother’s own milk or donor HM
using the GSH NICU Standardized Feeding Protocol. When
the protocol indicated fortification, feeds were fortified with
Prolact+H2MF to an additional 4 Cal/oz at 100 mL/kg/day
volume of feeds. Advancement to an additional 6 Cal/oz
occurred when infants reached a volume of 150 mL/kg/day. If
infants needed more concentrated feeds, fortification with the
donor HM-derived fortifier was increased to provide an ad-
ditional 8 Cal/oz. This regimen was continued until 60 days
of age, and then infants were transitioned to either mother’s
own milk with a bovine fortifier or preterm formula if
mother’s own milk was not available.
Northwestern
This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Northwestern University in Chicago, IL.
Infants were grouped based on year of birth: January 2009–
June 2012 (BOV) and July 2012–April 2014 (HUM). In-
formation for coding of variables was obtained from the VON.
The HUM feeding protocol was established at the Prentice
Women’s Hospital NICU in July 2012. Infants received
mother’s own milk and a donor HM-derived fortifier (Pro-
lact+H2MF). If mother’s own milk was not available, then
donor HM was provided for infants weighing £1,500 g, after
obtaining assent from the family. Enteral feeds were started
with trophic feeds of 10–20 mL/kg/day for 3 days. Feeds
were advanced by 20 mL/kg/day to reach a total volume goal
of 150–160 mL/kg/day. For infants £1,000 g Prolact+H2MF
was added once feeds reached 100–120 mL/kg/day for an
additional 4 Cal/oz. Fortification was advanced to 6 Cal/oz
if weight gain was <15 g/kg/day, and further advanced to
8 Cal/oz if there was continued low weight gain. Infants were
transitioned off this diet at 1,500 g or 34 weeks PMA. Prior to
July 2012, a similar feeding advancement protocol was fol-
lowed, but a bovine fortifier was used in place of the donor
HM-derived fortifier.
Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies
This retrospective study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of Orlando Health in Orlando, FL. Infants
were grouped based on year of birth: 2008–2010 (BOV) and
2011–2013 (HUM). Information for coding of variables was
obtained from the VON.
The HUM feeding protocol was initially established at the
Winnie Palmer Hospital NICU in November 2009 with total
adherence to the protocol in 2011. Infants received mother’s
own milk and/or donor milk if £750 g BW and £26 weeks

 gestational age. Donor HM products were provided after
obtaining family consent. Enteral feeds were started with
trophic feeds of 10–20 mL/kg/day for 3–5 days. Feeds were
advanced by 10–30 mL/kg/day to reach a total volume goal of
150–160 mL/kg/day. HM fortifier, Prolact+H2MF was added
once feeds reached 100–120 mL/kg/day for an additional 4
Cal/oz. If weight gain was determined to be suboptimal based
on growth curve velocity by the attending physician, an ad-
ditional 2–4 Cal/oz of fortification was added to the feeds for
a total of 6–8 kcal/oz. Infants were transitioned off the diet at
approximately 32 weeks PMA. Prior to 2009, babies received
mother’s own milk with bovine fortifier and/or preterm for-
mula. Bovine fortifier was introduced at approximately 120–
150 mL/kg/day.
Definitions
Small for gestational age (SGA) was defined as a weight of
<10th percentile on the Fenton Growth Curve.13 All NEC and
spontaneous intestinal perforation cases in the VON were re-
viewed individually at the time of data collection for this ret-
rospective study. A medical NEC diagnosis was designated as
Bell’s stage IIA or greater14 with the presence of pneumatosis
on abdominal radiograph as determined by a pediatric radiol-
ogist. The determination of NEC was made at each of the study
sites by agreement within those sites between the neonatologist
and the radiologist. Both radiographic and clinical correlates of
Bell’s stage IIA or greater were used at all sites to define NEC
cases. Surgical NEC was defined as requiring surgical inter-
vention within the acute phase of illness. Late-onset sepsis was
defined by the VON as any blood culture and/or cerebrospinal
fluid positive microbial infection after 3 days of life. Severe
ROP (threshold ROP) was defined as stage 3–5. Grade 3–4
IVH was classified by a pediatric radiologist per classifications
by Papile et al.15 As per the VON definition, BPD was defined
as need for oxygen at 36 weeks PMA.
Analysis
All analyses were based on the intent-to-treat principle. De-
scriptive statistics were used to summarize quantitative vari-
ables and reported as mean – standard deviation or with median
for skewed data. Initially, analyses were performed on a uni-
variate basis. Categorical data were compared between the study
groups using the chi-square test for univariate analysis. Quan-
titative data were compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum test
because of the right skew of some of the data. Comparisons were
considered statistically significant at p <0.05. An additional
multivariate adjustment model was considered for many of the
binary endpoints (including NEC, surgical NEC, late-onset
sepsis, IVH, ROP, PDA, and BPD) with the use of antenatal
steroids and/or study site as adjustment covariates. Study site
was adjusted for in a multiple logistic regression model with
group (BOV versus HUM) as the main effect. Indicator vari-
ables were included in the multivariate adjustment model for
study sites. A similar adjustment model based on a log or square
root-transformed linear regression model was employed for
ventilation days, length of stay, and PMA at discharge.
Results
The four centers had 1,587 infants eligible for inclusion in
the study. There were 768 infants in the BOV group and 819
infants in the HUM group. The number of infants from each
study site were as follows: Baylor College of Medicine 978,
Good Samaritan San Jose 91, Northwestern 317, and Winnie
Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies 201. The charac-
teristics of the two groups were similar (Table 1). However,
there was statistically significant difference in BW and birth
head circumference. The BOV group had a 5% lower per-
centage of mothers receiving antenatal steroids. There were
no differences in APGAR scores between the two groups
(Table 1).
The primary outcomes, NEC and mortality, were statisti-
cally significant (Table 2). The BOV group mortality rate was
17.2% (132/768), and the HUM group rate was 13.6% (111/
819; p = 0.04). There was a reduction in NEC and/or death
( p = 0.0002) that persisted when adjusted by study site. There
was a significant reduction in NEC cases in the HUM group
(Fig. 1). The number needed to treat to prevent one case of
NEC is 10. With the degree of reduction in NEC cases, a
subgroup analysis of NEC patients was completed (Table 3).
There was a significant reduction in medical and surgical
NEC ( p < 0.00005 and p < 0.00002). The distribution of the
number of NEC cases by gestational age is shown in Figure 2.
The secondary outcomes considered include growth pa-
rameters as well as variables associated with neonatal mor-
bidity (Table 4). There was no statistical increase in weight
gain, head circumference growth, or being SGA at the time of
discharge (Table 2). There was no significant decrease in
severe IVH, length of stay, or PMA at discharge. However,
there was a significant reduction in the incidence of late-onset
infection, ROP, presence of PDA, and BPD (Table 4). Using
the Wilcoxon rank sum test, there was a reduction in

17 days to a mean of 29 days with a median of 9 days
( p = 0.003).
Both logistic (categorical outcomes) and multiple linear
regression (quantitative outcomes) models were used to ad-
just for the use of antenatal steroids. The model consisted of
the particular primary or secondary outcome as the depen-
dent variable, and study group (HUM or BOV) along with
antenatal steroid use as the independent variables. Sig-
nificance was lost only for mortality ( p = 0.27). All other
outcomes remained statistically significant. These models
were also used to adjust for study site, and all variables re-
mained significant.
Discussion
It was found that the use of an exclusive HUM diet in
extremely premature infants (<1,250 g BW) decreased the
incidence of both medical and surgical NEC, further sup-
porting the results of Sullivan et al. in regards to reduction of
NEC.12 This study also shows an association with a reduction
in mortality and late-onset infections. An association was
demonstrated with decreased ROP, BPD, PDA, and ventilator
days that has not been previously reported. In addition to the
reduction in NEC, the additional reduction in morbidity may
decrease the cost of a NICU hospitalization. Recent analysis
found a significant cost reduction when using a HUM feeding
protocol compared with using a bovine fortifier.16
To the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to com-
pare rates of NEC after a feeding protocol implementation at
multiple institutions with multiple years of follow-up while
using an exclusive HUM diet. Additional strengths of this
study include a large study population to evaluate differences
in outcomes between the two groups. The multiple centers
involved increases the generalizability of the study.
In addition, while many clinical studies have extensive
exclusion criteria, including inability to obtain parental
consent, this study only excluded infants with major con-
genital anomalies, infants who died within 48 hours of ad-
mission, or infants transferred to another hospital after 1
week of age. Therefore, all infants <1,250 g BW were in-
cluded in this naturalistic study, including infants <23 weeks
of age, <500 g BW, and growth-restricted infants. Due to the
inclusion of high-risk infants, who are not often included in
feeding or NEC studies, it is speculated that this may have
contributed to the higher rates of NEC, sepsis, and mortality.
However, a significant reduction was shown in all outcomes
after the introduction of an exclusive HUM diet. Although
three of the four centers fed infants <1,000 g BW a HUM
feeding protocol, 62% of the infants in this study were from
Baylor College of Medicine (Texas Children’s Hospital),
which fed infants <1,250 g BW a HUM feeding protocol. The
effect of a HUM diet provides benefits across all weight

 categories consistent with the previous randomized clinical
trials evaluating a HUM diet.9,12
Some limitations to this study are acknowledged. A small
difference was identified in BW and birth head circumference
between study groups that is not believed to be clinically
significant. The nature of a retrospective study lends to sev-
eral biases such as misclassification biases, particularly in
relation to the diagnosis of NEC, although the classification
was determined by two researchers separately. It is possible
that over the period this study occurred, there were changes in
practice aside from type of milk and fortifier used that could
confound these notable changes. It is acknowledged that
mother’s milk and pasteurized donor HM likely increased
during the study period and potentially contributed to the
improved outcomes. However, the study showed a 60% de-
crease in the incidence of NEC compared with only a 20%
decrease in NEC in participating centers in the VON over the
same time period. It is also acknowledged that at the time of
the feeding protocol changes, there was increased awareness
of central line infection initiatives to decrease central line
associated bloodstream infections, which may have contrib-
uted to a reduction in late-onset infection. However, an all-
HUM diet has been shown to be associated with decreased
parenteral nutrition days, which serves as a surrogate for
central line days.6,9 In addition, with a decrease in the inci-
dence of NEC, it was possible to reduce the central line days.
Conclusion
The use of an exclusive HUM diet is associated with sig-
nificant benefits for extremely premature infants <1,250 g BW.
The benefits include decreased NEC rates, mortality, late-onset
sepsis, PDA, BPD, ventilator days, and ROP. Importantly,
while evaluatingthe benefits of using an exclusive HUM-based
protocol, it appears that there were no feeding-related adverse
outcomes. This study demonstrates that an exclusive HUM diet
provides important benefits beyond NEC.
