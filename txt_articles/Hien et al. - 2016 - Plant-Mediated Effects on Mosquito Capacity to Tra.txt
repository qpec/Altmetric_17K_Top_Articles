Abstract
The ecological context in which mosquitoes and malaria parasites interact has received little
attention, compared to the genetic and molecular aspects of malaria transmission. Plant
nectar and fruits are important for the nutritional ecology of malaria vectors, but how the nat-
ural diversity of plant-derived sugar sources affects mosquito competence for malaria para-
sites is unclear. To test this, we infected Anopheles coluzzi, an important African malaria
vector, with sympatric field isolates of Plasmodium falciparum, using direct membrane feed-
ing assays. Through a series of experiments, we then examined the effects of sugar meals
from Thevetia neriifolia and Barleria lupilina cuttings that included flowers, and fruit from Lan-
nea microcarpa and Mangifera indica on parasite and mosquito traits that are key for deter-
mining the intensity of malaria transmission. We found that the source of plant sugar meal
differentially affected infection prevalence and intensity, the development duration of the
parasites, as well as the survival and fecundity of the vector. These effects are likely the
result of complex interactions between toxic secondary metabolites and the nutritional qual-
ity of the plant sugar source, as well as of host resource availability and parasite growth.
Using an epidemiological model, we show that plant sugar source can be a significant driver
of malaria transmission dynamics, with some plant species exhibiting either transmission-
reducing or -enhancing activities.

 unknown. Here we show that mosquito feeding on peridomestic plant- and fruit-derived
sugar sources can affect its interaction with P. falciparum, and hence malaria transmission.
The planting of anti-Plasmodium plant sugar sources may represent a promising alterna-
tive strategy to contribute to the control of malaria.
Introduction
The ability of anopheline mosquitoes to transmit Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a complex
phenotypic trait, determined by mosquito and parasite genetic factors, environmental factors,
as well as the interaction between these factors [1–6]. A key environmental variable for host-
parasite relationships is the availability and quality of food resources, which have been shown
to influence host susceptibility, parasite infectivity and virulence, and ultimately disease
dynamics [7]. The influence of diet on infectious diseases is particularly apparent in tritrophic
interactions involving herbivorous insects, their parasites and larval food plants [8]. Such
plant-mediated effects have often been attributed to either the direct toxic effect of plant sec-
ondary metabolites on parasite development [9], or differences in nutritional value that, in
turn, affect host immunocompetence [10].
Mosquitoes, like herbivorous insects, are part of a multitrophic system that includes plants
and parasites. Although female mosquitoes are well known blood-feeders, sugar sources such
as nectar from floral and extra-floral nectaries, fruits and phloem sap compose an important
part of their diet and have significant biological implications [11,12]. Recent studies indicate
that females of An. gambiae s.l., the main vector of P. falciparum in large areas of Africa, can
locate and display preference for natural sources of plant sugar [13–16], and that environmen-
tal sugars may play a crucial role in malaria vectorial capacity (a standard measure of malaria
transmission potential), through effects on mosquito survival [17–24] or blood-feeding rate
[17,21–23]. However, feeding on plant tissues could also influence vectorial capacity by
enhancing or mitigating infection in malaria mosquitoes.
Compared to the important efforts devoted to documenting plant-mediated interactions
among herbivorous insects and their parasites [8], studies on the nutritional effects in mos-
quito-Plasmodium interactions have lagged behind despite obvious epidemiological impor-
tance. The few existing studies indicate that adult diet can indeed influence mosquito
immunocompetence and susceptibility to malaria parasites [25–30]. However, these studies
have focused on quantitative, as opposed to qualitative, changes in diet, and have used non-
natural food sources (e.g. different concentrations of glucose solutions). Whether natural plant
diversity affects mosquito susceptibility to malaria parasites therefore remains to be discovered.
The current study addresses questions of the impact of natural plant diversity on mosquito
susceptibility to malaria parasites, using the natural tritrophic interaction between the parasite
P. falciparum, responsible for causing the most severe form of human malaria, the mosquito
An. coluzzii (formerly the M molecular form of An. gambiae s.s.), a major vector of P. falcipa-
rum in Africa, and a range of peridomestic plant- and fruit-derived sugar sources. We chal-
lenged An. coluzzi females with sympatric field isolates of P. falciparum using direct membrane
feeding assays and, through a series of experiments, examined the effects of plant sugar sources
on parasite and mosquito traits that are instrumental in determining the intensity of malaria
transmission: (i) the early parasite development within mosquito guts, (ii) the proportion of
mosquitoes harboring sporozoite transmissible stages (i.e. the sporozoite index), (iii) the
extrinsic incubation period of the parasite (EIP), (iv) the survival and fecundity of infected
mosquitoes, and (v) the costs and benefits to feed on these plant sugar sources for both infected

 and uninfected mosquitoes. Finally, these results were combined into an epidemiological
model to predict the relative contribution of different plant species to overall malaria transmis-
sion. We provide evidence for malaria transmission-reducing and -enhancing activities of
some natural plant sugar sources.
Methods
Mosquitoes
Laboratory-reared An. coluzzii were obtained from an outbred colony established in 2008 and
repeatedly replenished with F1 from wild-caught mosquito females collected in Kou Valley
(11°23'14"N, 4°24'42"W), 30 km from Bobo Dioulasso, south-western Burkina Faso (West
Africa), and identified by routine PCR-RFLP. Mosquitoes were held in 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm
mesh-covered cages at the IRSS insectary under standard conditions (27 ± 2°C, 70 ± 5% relative
humidity, 12:12 LD). Females were maintained on rabbit blood by direct feeding, and adult
males and females fed with 5% glucose. Larvae were reared at a density of about 300 first instar
larvae in 700 ml of water in plastic trays and were fed with Tetramin Baby Fish Food (Tetra-
werke, Melle, Germany).
Plant materials and mosquito feeding on plant sugar source
We selected two perennial flowering ornamental plants: Thevetia neriifolia and Barleria lupi-
lina collected in the gardens and parkland of Bobo Dioulasso (S1A and S1B Fig); and two fruits:
mango (Mangifera indica, variety “demoiselle”) and Lannea microcarpa, both locally produced
and purchased from the market in Bobo Dioulasso (S1C and S1D Fig). The plants and fruits
were selected based on (i) their wide distribution around human dwellings in villages and cities
of western Burkina Faso, (ii) An. coluzzii females readily rest, probe and feed on them (inferred
from both field and lab observations, S1 appendix and [31]), and (iii) they provide relatively
high mosquito survival to allow for the development of Plasmodium falciparum.
Plant sugar sources were offered to mosquitoes in 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm mesh-covered
cages. For T. neriifolia and B. lupilina, between five and ten fresh bundles of flowering cuttings
were added within each cage. The base of the bunch was wrapped in moistened paper towels
and an aluminum sheet (S2A and S2B Fig). For the mango treatment, ripe fruits were cut in
half, held on two 20 cm long wooden stakes and individually placed in the mosquito cages
(S2C Fig). One bunch of about 40 ripe L. microcarpa fruits was placed in a petri dish within the
mosquito cages (S2D Fig). Finally, 5% glucose was provided on cotton pads wrapped around
two 20 cm long wooden stick (S2E Fig). Cuttings, fruits, and glucose were replaced every day.
To confirm sugar ingestion, the gut content of a subset of mosquitoes was determined by the
cold anthrone test for fructose [32] (S1 Appendix). Mosquitoes can sugar feed from a wide
range of plant parts (floral nectaries, extra-floral nectaries at the base of the flowers or on stems
or leaves, tissues juices, phloem sap, and honeydew) [11]. Here, the exact sources of the sugar
taken up by mosquito females on plant cuttings (T. neriifolia and B. lupilina) were not
determined.
Parasite isolate and experimental infections
Plasmodium falciparum gametocyte carriers were recruited among 5–12-year-old school chil-
dren in the villages of Soumousso and Dande, located respectively 30 km north east and 60 km
North West of Bobo Dioulasso in southwestern Burkina Faso. Parasitological surveys were car-
ried out in collaboration with the medical team in charge of malaria treatment at the local
health center in these two villages. Thick blood smears were taken from each volunteer, air-

 dried, Giemsa-stained, and examined by microscopy for the presence of P. falciparum at the IRSS
lab in Bobo Dioulasso. Asexual trophozoite parasite stages were counted against 200 leucocytes,
while infectious gametocytes stages were counted against 1000 leukocytes. Children with asexual
parasitemia of > 1,000 parasites per microliter (estimated based on an average of 8000 leuco-
cytes/ml) were treated in accordance with national guidelines. Asymptomatic P. falciparum
gametocyte-positive children were recruited for the study. Mosquito infections were performed
by direct feeding membrane assays using whole donor blood (i.e. no serum replacement) [33,34].
Briefly, gametocyte carrier blood was collected by venipuncture into heparinized tubes. Three to
four day old female mosquitoes, distributed in 500 ml paper cups at a density of 80 mosquitoes
per cup, were allowed to feed on this blood for one hour. Mosquitoes were starved of glucose
solution for 24 h prior to the infection, with only water available, in wet cotton wool. Non-fed or
partially fed females were removed and discarded, while the remaining fully-engorged mosqui-
toes were maintained in a biosafety room under the same standard conditions of 27 ± 2°C,
70 ± 5% relative humidity and, 12:12 LD) on their assigned plant sugar source.
Experiment 1: To determine the effect of plant sugars on the early
development of P. falciparum and on mosquito survival and fecundity
Upon emergence, batches of female mosquitoes from the colony were randomly assigned to
one of four sugar sources: a 5% glucose solution, T. neriifolia, B. lupilina or M. indica, for three
to four days. Thus, mosquitoes were given ample time to feed on their sugar source, and by 2–3
days, all mosquitoes would have acquired sugar meal at least once. Male and female mosquitoes
were kept together to ensure insemination. Three to four day old females were then transferred
to paper cups for infection (see above). After infection, fully-engorged females were placed in
30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm mesh-covered cages with their assigned sugar source (S2 Fig). Females
thus received the sugar treatment both before and after the infection. Seven days post blood-
meal, mosquitoes were dissected to assess microscopically (×400) the presence of oocysts in the
midgut stained with 2% mercurochrome. We also examined whether ovaries contained
matured eggs (egg incidence). Mosquito survival was monitored from 1 to 7 days post-treat-
ment (dpi). Twice a day, dead mosquitoes were removed and counted from each cage at 08:00
and 17:00. We performed four replicates using a total of seven gametocyte carriers. To avoid
potential cage effect on survival, fecundity and susceptibility to infection, mosquitoes belonging
to the same sugar treatment and fed on blood from the same gametocyte carrier were distrib-
uted in at least two different cages. On average, 30 (range 10–50) mosquitoes per sugar treat-
ment and gametocyte carrier were dissected (except for the mango treatment, gametocyte
carriers A and B for which only 1 and 4 mosquitoes were dissected, respectively, due to a low
survival rate, see details in S1 Table).
Experiment 2: To determine the effect of plant sugars on sporozoite
index and EIP
The same general procedure as that described in Experiment 1 was used in Experiment 2.
Because P. falciparum takes an average of 14 days to disseminate sporozoite, and mosquito sur-
vival rate on M. indica was relatively low, we chose to replace this fruit with L. microcarpa. As
in the previous experiment, mosquitoes were offered their assigned sugar sources both before
and after the infection. Mosquitoes were sampled from day 9 to 13 dpi by dissecting the head
and thorax of 20 mosquitoes from each treatment and time point to estimate the parasite’s
extrinsic incubation period. On day 14 the remaining mosquitoes in each cage were similarly
dissected. The head and thorax were individually stored at -20°C. Sporozoite dissemination in
head and thorax was assessed using PCR [35]. Mosquito survival was monitored from 1 to 14

 dpi. Twice a day, dead mosquitoes were removed and counted from each cage at 08:00 and
17:00. We performed 2 replicates using a total of 4 gametocyte carriers between April and June
2013. On average, 26 (range 8–50) mosquitoes per sugar treatment and gametocyte carrier
were dissected (see details in S2 Table).
Experiment 3: To determine how parasite infection and host plant
species interact to influence mosquito longevity
The general procedure was identical to that of the two previous experiments except that a
group of uninfected control mosquitoes was added, and that survival was monitored until all
the mosquitoes had died. We assigned female mosquitoes to a 5% glucose solution, M. indica,
T. neriifolia or B. lupilina. Uninfected control mosquitoes received heat-treated gametocytic
blood. Briefly, half of the venous blood drawn from the gametocyte carrier was heated at 45°C
for 20 minutes to kill the parasite gametocytes. Such heat treatment does not affect the survival
and fecundity of mosquito females [36]. Because the nutritive quality of blood substantially
vary among people and especially between infected and uninfected individuals, this procedure
allows experiments to avoid the potential confounding effects of different blood origins on the
performance of infected and control mosquitoes [33,37].
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in R (version 2.15.3). Logistic regression by Generalized
Linear Mixed Models (GLMM, binomial errors, logit link; lme4 package) was used to investi-
gate the effect of sugar treatment on oocyst infection rate (Experiment 1) and sporozoite index
(Experiment 2). GLMM with negative binomial errors (glmmADMB package) was used to test
the effect of sugar treatment on oocyst intensity (Experiment 1). For these GLMMs, full models
included sugar treatment and gametocytemia and their interaction as fixed effects. Binomial
GLMM was also used to test the effect of sugar treatment, infection and gametocytemia on
mosquito egg incidence (presence/absence of mature eggs in ovaries, Experiment 1). In all
GLMMs, gametocyte carrier identity was included as a random effect. The effect of sugar treat-
ment on mosquito survivorship was analyzed using Cox’s proportional hazard regression mod-
els ("coxph" function in the "survival" package) with (experiments 1 and 2) or without
(experiment 3) censoring. Sugar treatment, gametocytemia, infection (for experiment 3 only)
and their interaction were considered as explanatory variables. Model simplification used step-
wise removal of terms, followed by likelihood ratio tests (LRT). Term removals that signifi-
cantly reduced explanatory power (p < 0.05) were retained in the minimal adequate model.
Mathematical modeling
To quantify the consequences of plant sugar source on malaria transmission, we designed a
mathematical model, grounded within the SIR framework [38,39], that accounts for the essen-
tial transmission processes: vector competence (i.e. infection level) and infectious potential
(the period during which the mosquito can transmit the pathogen). We assumed that the mos-
quito population studied could be categorized into Susceptible individuals (Sm, i.e. that could
be infected), which then moved to the Exposed category upon infection (Em, i.e. infected, but
not yet infectious) and became Infectious (Im, i.e. mosquitoes that can transmit the pathogen).
Infectious potential was characterized by two phases: a first phase of low infection level (when
the oocysts crack up and sporozoites begin to invade mosquito salivary glands i.e. day 9 to days
10–11) followed by a second phase of higher infection levels (from day 10–11 until mosquito
death). The duration and vector competence for each phase and each plant are detailed in the
S2 Appendix. We also assumed similar categories for the human population (S2 Appendix).

 We simulated the expected outbreak size in a human population (number of individuals that
has been infected at the end of the season when one infectious human was introduced into a
population of 100 individuals) for each plant sugar. We explored the parameter space through
a Latin hypercube sampling with 10,000 replicates for which all parameters were randomly
chosen within their confidence interval based on the data measurements obtained experimen-
tally here. Data are deposited in the Dryad repository: (DOI: doi:10.5061/dryad.9s690) [40]

Results
Plant sugar source influences the early development of P. falciparum
and the vector’s survival and fecundity
A total of 324 out of 764 (42.4%) An. coluzzii became successfully infected upon parasite expo-
sure. The infection rate significantly varied among mosquitoes maintained on different sugar
treatments (LRT X2
3 = 13.2, P = 0.004; Fig 1A). Infection dose (i.e. gametocytemia) signifi-
cantly affected parasite prevalence, with higher gametocyte density in blood leading to an
increased likelihood of infection (X2
1 inline = 5.2, P = 0.04). Finally, there was a significant
gametocytemia by sugar treatment interaction (X2
3 inline = 10.2, P = 0.017).
The mean number of developing oocysts in infected females (i.e. intensity) significantly var-
ied among sugar treatments (LRT X2
3 = 19.8, P = 0.0002, Fig 1B). Gametocytemia had a posi-
tive effect on intensity (LRT X2
1 = 4.6, P = 0.03), and there was a significant gametocytemia by
sugar treatment interaction (LRT X2
3 = 12.5, P = 0.006).
Sugar source was also linked to the probability of a mosquito surviving until 7 dpi (LRT X2
3 =
80, P < 0.001; Fig 1C and S3 Table), with survivorship ranging from 92%, 90% and 89.5% on 5%
glucose, T. neriifolia and B. lupilina, respectively, to 50% on M. indica. Egg incidence was reduced
in mosquitoes fed on M. indica (LRT X2
3 = 27, P < 0.001; Fig 1D and S3 Table). Infected females
were more likely to carry eggs in their ovaries compared to females exposed to an infectious blood-
meal but which remained uninfected (hereafter referred to as “exposed-uninfected”) (LRT X2
1 = 8,
P = 0.005; Fig 1D), irrespective of sugar treatment (i.e. no infection by sugar treatment interaction:
LRT X2
3 = 3.5, P = 0.32, Fig 1D). Among infected females, egg incidence was also positively associ-
ated with infection intensity (X2
1 = 5.8, P = 0.016, S3 Fig). Finally, there was no effect of gametocy-
temia on mosquito survival (LRT X2
1 = 0.12, P = 0.72) and egg incidence (LRT X2
1 = 1.3, P = 0.26).

Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP)
The aim of this experiment was to determine the extent to which natural plant sugar sources
can affect the time of sporozoite release as well as the proportion of mosquitoes harboring

 sporozoites. A high mortality rate was observed in mosquitoes fed on M. indica (Fig 1C and
preliminary data indicating a very low number of mosquitoes surviving until 14 dpi, the aver-
age incubation period of P. falciparum), hence, we replaced M. indica with Lannea microcarpa
(S1 Fig), a less common fruit-derived sugar but one which provides relatively high mosquito
survival rate.
Overall, a total of 235 out of 420 (56%) An. coluzzii harbored sporozoites 14 dpi. Sugar treat-
ment had a significant effect on sporozoite index (LRT X2
3 = 15; P = 0.002; Fig 2A), with mos-
quitoes fed on T. neriifolia being less likely to harbor disseminated sporozoites (Fig 2A).
Gametocytemia positively influenced sporozoite index (LRT X2
1 = 4, P = 0.046). We also found
an effect of sugar treatment on mosquito survival (LRT X2
3 = 26; P < 0.001, Fig 2B and S3

 Table) with mosquitoes living longer when maintained on B. lupilina followed by L. micro-
carpa, 5% glucose and T. neriifolia.
Sporozoites were observed as soon as 9 dpi (Fig 2C). Significant differences in sporozoite
index between sugar treatments were observed from 10 to 14 dpi, indicating that the temporal
dynamics of sporozoite dissemination varied (Fig 2C) depending on sugar treatment. As
expected, there was a significant time effect with sporozoite index increasing over time (LRT
X2
1 = 94, P < 0.0001).
Plant sugar source similarly influences the longevity of infected and
uninfected control mosquitoes
The previous experiment showed a reduced sporozoite index in T. neriifolia-fed mosquitoes
(Fig 2A) compared to those fed on other sugar sources. Although, this can be an effect of the
plant on parasite development and sporozoite dissemination, this observation is also consistent
with an increased mortality of infected individuals compared to exposed-uninfected counter-
parts. In other words, there might be an interaction between infection and plant treatment,
such that infected mosquitoes suffer increased mortality when reared on this species, and
hence display reduced sporozoite index at 14 dpi. Therefore, we measured mosquito longevity
using a factorial design, crossing infection status (infected with P. falciparum versus exposed-
uninfected versus uninfected control) with sugar treatment. Uninfected control mosquitoes
received a heat-treated gametocytic blood meal. Because M. indica showed an effect on both
oocyst infection rate and intensity (Fig 1A and 1C), while L. microcarpa showed no effect on
sporozoite dissemination (Fig 2A) compared to a 5% glucose solution, we used M. indica
instead of L. microcarpa for this experiment.
Infection status had no effect on mosquito lifespan (LRT X2
2 = 1; P = 0.6, Fig 3). Impor-
tantly, although mosquito longevity significantly varied among sugar treatment (LRT X2
3 =
160; P < 0.001, Fig 3), there was no sugar treatment by infection status interactions (LRT
X2
6 = 4.8; P = 0.56, Fig 3), demonstrating that the source of the sugar meals affected mos-
quito longevity irrespective of their infection status. We further analyzed the effect of infec-
tion status on the longevity of T. neriifolia-fed mosquitoes only and found no significant
difference (LRT X2
2 = 1.6; P = 0.4). This suggests that the observed reduction in the sporozo-
ite index of mosquitoes fed on T. neriifolia does not result from the influence of increased
parasite virulence on mosquito lifespan.
Plant sugar source affects the transmission intensity of malaria
The epidemiological outcome predicted by the model for each plant species considered in isola-
tion is consistent with intuitive expectations (Fig 4A). Compared to the baseline scenario with
a 5% glucose solution, both L. microcarpa and B. lupilina caused an increased transmission
potential, mainly because of increased infection rates among mosquitoes exposed to an infec-
tious blood-meal (i.e. higher vector competence) (S4 Fig). In contrast, T. neriifolia induced a
lower transmission potential, mainly because of a lower mosquito competence. as well as a lon-
ger infectious period (longevity).
When considering these individual effects within a community perspective, including the
various proportions of each plant species, contrasting results appeared (Fig 4B). We assumed
that mosquitoes do not display preference for plant species, hence that feeding choice is solely
dependent on plant relative abundance. First, when considering plant communities generally
occurring in urban areas, malaria transmission potential was largely impacted by plant relative
abundance (Fig 4B). In this setting, increasing plant diversity leads to a decrease in T. neriifolia
relative abundance and hence results in higher levels of transmission. In contrast, the different

 configurations of plant relative abundance showed similar patterns of transmission in rural
areas where T. neriifolia is less abundant.
Discussion
Feeding on different sources of natural plant-derived sugars can influence key traits that affect
the capacity of mosquitoes to transmit malaria, including mosquito longevity and mosquito
susceptibility to P. falciparum. When combined into an epidemiological model these effects
have important consequences for malaria transmission. Compared to control mosquitoes fed
on a 5% glucose solution, individuals fed on T. neriifolia showed a 30% decrease in malaria
transmission. In contrast, mosquitoes fed on L. microcarpa and B. lupilina showed a 30% and
40% increase in transmission potential, respectively. Previous research has revealed the role of
sugar in providing energy for flight, increasing mosquito survival and fecundity and decreasing
biting rate on vertebrate hosts [12,23]. Our findings add a more direct effect of epidemiological

 importance by showing that plant-derived sugars can modulate mosquito-Plasmodium
interactions.
The plant-mediated effect on infection could not be attributed to variation in blood meal
size (S3 Appendix). Uptake of larger infectious blood meals may result in more gametocytes
entering the mosquito midgut [41] and hence possibly increased infection. We tested whether
plant sugar source could influence mosquito blood meal size. Mosquitoes fed with L. micro-
carpa prior to a blood meal took on average smaller blood meals than mosquitoes fed on glu-
cose 5% or B. lupilina (S1 Appendix). However, infection in L. microcarpa-fed mosquitoes was
not higher than that of glucose- or B. lupilina-fed individuals (Fig 2A). Furthermore, the results
could not be attributed to mosquito inability to survive on particular plant sources such as M.
indica owing to less feeding and eventual starvation (S4 Appendix).
At least three non-mutually exclusive mechanisms could explain the effects of plant sugar
sources on mosquito competence for P. falciparum. First, there can be direct negative effects of
plant secondary metabolites (e.g. alkaloids, terpenes, glycosides) on pathogen development.
Secondary compounds generally play a role in plant defense against herbivores and thereby
tend to be toxic and reduce host survivorship and reproduction [42,43]. These chemicals are
found in all plant tissues, including floral nectars and fleshy fruits [44–47]. In bumblebees for
example, the ingestion of alkaloids, terpenoids and iridoid glycosides contained in floral nectars
can reduce infection by the protozoan parasite, Crithidia bombi [48,49]. Second, plants can

Epidemiological outcomes predicted by the model for each plant species considered in isolation, and (b) in a
community perspective. In urban areas (upper panel), Thevetia neriifolia is relatively more abundant than
Barleria lupilina and Lannea microcarpa. Four configurations with various relative abundances were
considered: (i) a scenario of no diversity whereby T. neriifolia—the dominant plant—represents 100% of the
feeding opportunities, (ii) a scenario of 60% T. neriifolia, 30% B. lupilina and 10% L. microcarpa, (iii) a
scenario of 60–20–20%, and (iv) a scenario of equal feeding opportunities on each plant species. In rural
areas (lower panel), L. microcarpa is relatively more abundant than T. neriifolia and B. lupilina. The same
configurations as for urban areas were considered using this ranking. Outbreak size is the proportion of
humans that has been infected at the end of the transmission season after one infectious human was
introduced into the population. The box plots indicate the median (large horizontal bars), the 25th and 75th
percentiles (squares), the minimum and maximum values (whiskers) and outliers (circles).

 enhance or reduce infection by modulating the host body condition and energetic status [50].
Feeding on poor quality resources may yield less energy to parasite growth and hence limit par-
asite infection [51]. Third, plants may indirectly influence infection through effects on host
immune response or gut microbiota. Because immunological defenses are energetically expen-
sive, hosts in poor condition may display reduced resistance to parasites [52]. In our experi-
ments, mosquitoes fed with M. indica fruits or T. neriifolia flowers displayed reduced infection
levels and reduced fitness (survivorship or fecundity), thus corroborating the first two mecha-
nisms. T. neriifolia contain toxic cardiac glycosides, and mango fruits contain phenolic com-
pounds, including mangiferin, two secondary metabolite groups suspected to have strong anti-
protozoan properties [9,53–55]. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that malaria
parasites require sugars from the vector for an optimal development [56,57]. The relationships
between nutrition, host general condition, toxic chemicals and infection are complex [58,59],
and further studies are required to determine whether T. neriifolia and mango fruits have direct
anti-plasmodium activities or have low nutritional value that limit both parasite growth and
host fitness. The plant sugar source treatment was continuously provided in our study, thus it
will be important to determine whether these effects result from the ingestion of plant-derived
sugars prior (prophylactic effects) or post (therapeutic effects) infection. Mosquitoes from a
colony continually replenished with F1 from wild-caught females were used here and it will
also be important to study plant-mediated effects using field mosquitoes since rearing insects
in the laboratory for many generations is unlikely to represent the genetic diversity observed in
nature.
Under natural conditions, the frequency of contacts between a mosquito and a source of
natural sugar will depend on the innate plant preference of the insect and environmental fac-
tors such as plant availability and accessibility. Our design did not allow the mosquitoes to
choose between the different plants. We expect different epidemiological consequences when
mosquitoes consume different proportions of each plant. Using our model, we simulated dif-
ferent scenarios of plant relative abundance in either urban (where T. neriifolia is relatively
dominant compared to B. lupilina and L. microcarpa) or rural (where L. microcarpa domi-
nates) areas. Our findings indicate that sharp epidemiological differences are indeed expected
in urban areas where relatively small decreases in T. neriifolia abundance could lead to impor-
tant increases in malaria transmission. This can be interpreted as an example of a dilution
effect whereby poor-competent host species decreases the average efficiency of pathogen trans-
mission [60,61]. In contrast, in rural areas, a decrease in L. microcarpa abundance in favor of T.
neriifolia would only have a small negative impact on disease transmission (i.e. a weak dilution
effect [60]).
Infected mosquitoes were more likely to carry eggs in their ovary compared to exposed-
uninfected counterparts. This finding may illustrate a cost of resistance whereby the expression
of an efficient immune response against Plasmodium establishment comes at a cost to egg pro-
duction. Alternatively, this finding may illustrate the terminal investment hypothesis (also
known as fecundity compensation), which postulates that when the future reproductive oppor-
tunities of an individual decline because of high mortality risk such as high infection levels,
organisms increase their current reproductive investment [48]. We examined the first gono-
trophic cycle only and further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms responsible for
the increased probability of egg development in infected individuals.
Although we did not find any significant reductions in mosquito longevity or fecundity fol-
lowing Plasmodium infection, previous studies have demonstrated that this parasite can be
costly to the mosquito host, especially in specific conditions reflecting what occurs in nature,
such as nutritional, predation, insecticide or hydric stress [37,39,62–65]. Since Plasmodium
infection decreases mosquito fitness, natural selection should favor the evolution of defenses

 against it. Besides immunological defenses, insect hosts can develop behavioral defenses
including self-medication to better resist or tolerate their parasites [66,67]. Alternatively,
malaria parasites might manipulate mosquito plant preference in ways that favor their own
development and transmission [3,68]. A recent study found that P. falciparum infection
increases both An. gambiae attraction to nectar sources and their total sugar uptake [69]. It will
be of fundamental importance to better investigate the fitness costs and benefits of feeding on
different natural sugar sources and to study plant preference by infected and uninfected mos-
quitoes. This will allow us to determine whether mosquito vectors or P. falciparum can exploit
plant sugar sources to respectively self-medicate or manipulate the insect plant choice.
The interaction between malaria parasites and mosquito vector has drawn much attention
for possible interventions to prevent transmission of this pathogen. Our findings have several
implications for disease control. A number of different genetic manipulation strategies are now
available to reduce mosquito competence for Plasmodium in the laboratory (refractory trans-
genic mosquitoes) [70–72]. In addition, the use of transmission-blocking vaccines against P.
falciparum mosquito-stages has proven to be a promising strategy [73]. However, before trans-
lating these findings into the natural settings, it will be crucial to determine how the transgenes
expression or vaccine efficacy can be affected by mosquito plant-feeding behavior. Finally,
some novel perspective for malaria control including the cultivation of anti-Plasmodium plants
may be truly sustainable. Concretely, fostering the planting of species such as T. neriifolia,
which is commonly used by mosquitoes and which negatively affects vectorial capacity may
locally reduce malaria transmission.
