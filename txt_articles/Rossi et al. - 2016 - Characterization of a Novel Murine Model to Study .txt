Abstract.
The mosquito-borne Zika virus (ZIKV) is responsible for an explosive ongoing outbreak of febrile illness
across the Americas. ZIKV was previously thought to cause only a mild, flu-like illness, but during the current outbreak,
an association with Guillain–Barré syndrome and microcephaly in neonates has been detected. A previous study showed
that ZIKV requires murine adaptation to generate reproducible murine disease. In our study, a low-passage Cambodian
isolate caused disease and mortality in mice lacking the interferon (IFN) alpha receptor (A129 mice) in an age-dependent
manner, but not in similarly aged immunocompetent mice. In A129 mice, viremia peaked at ∼107 plaque-forming units/mL
by day 2 postinfection (PI) and reached high titers in the spleen by day 1. ZIKV was detected in the brain on day 3 PI and
caused signs of neurologic disease, including tremors, by day 6. Robust replication was also noted in the testis. In this
model, all mice infected at the youngest age (3 weeks) succumbed to illness by day 7 PI. Older mice (11 weeks) showed
signs of illness, viremia, and weight loss but recovered starting on day 8. In addition, AG129 mice, which lack both type I
and II IFN responses, supported similar infection kinetics to A129 mice, but with exaggerated disease signs. This char-
acterization of an Asian lineage ZIKV strain in a murine model, and one of the few studies reporting a model of Zika
disease and demonstrating age-dependent morbidity and mortality, could provide a platform for testing the efficacy of anti-
virals and vaccines.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging mosquito-borne patho-
gen that is part of the Spondweni serocomplex of the genus
Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. The Flavivirus genus includes
many viruses that produce disease in humans, including dengue,
yellow fever, St. Louis encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, West
Nile encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis.1,2 Relatively little
research has been conducted on ZIKV since its first isola-
tion almost 70 years ago from the blood of a sentinel rhesus
monkey in the Zika forest of Uganda.1,3,4 Before 2007, reported
cases of ZIKV infection (Zika fever) have been sporadic and
benign. Furthermore, it has been estimated that up to 80% of
ZIKV infections are asymptomatic.5 Patients with symptom-
atic ZIKV infection usually present with a mild febrile illness
characterized by fever, rash, arthralgia, myalgia, headache,
and conjunctivitis, similar to infections with other arboviruses
circulating in ranges that overlap ZIKV, including dengue
virus (DENV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV).5 However,
recent outbreaks, including those in French Polynesia, Brazil,
have suggested an association of ZIKV infection with serious
complications, such as the neurological autoimmune disorder
Guillain–Barré syndrome and microcephaly in the infants of
mothers infected during pregnancy.6–8
The growing concern over the explosive ZIKV epidemic
now occurring throughout the Americas prompted the World
Health Organization to declare a Public Health Emergency
of International Concern on February 1, 2016.9 The American
epidemic was first noted in Brazil in early 2015,10 which spread
quickly, with more than 25 countries reporting autochthonous
cases by early 2016.11 Unlike the previous small outbreaks
in the South Pacific, millions of people are estimated to have
been infected,12 and more cases of severe complications have
been reported. The reasons for the rapid spread of ZIKV are
unknown and are likely multifactorial, including a large naive
human population and a high abundance of the mosquito vector
Aedes aegypti.13 It is also possible that previously unrecognized
or underappreciated routes of transmission such as blood
transfusion14 or sexual transmission15,16 have played a role in
the outbreak.
The ZIKV genome comprises a single-stranded, positive-
sense 11-kb RNA that contains structural (capsid [C], premem-
brane [prM], and envelope [E]) and seven nonstructural (NS1,
NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) genes. Genomic
sequencing has revealed two lineages of ZIKV: the ancestral
African lineage from which the original 1947 isolate (MR766)
was made and an Asian lineage.1 Viruses belonging to the Asian
lineage are responsible for the 2007 Yap outbreak and the cur-
rent New World epidemic.5,10,17 It is unknown whether genetic
differences between the African and Asian lineages play a role
in the scope and severity of current outbreaks.
Previous work to develop an animal model for Zika infec-
tion or disease was conducted in the 1950s. In these studies,
rhesus macaques were used to amplify the virus and produce
the first ZIKV isolate, MR 766.3 Not all primates that were
infected showed signs of disease, prompting the examination of
small rodents such as mice, guinea pigs, and rabbits. Although
death was sometimes observed, consistent disease in adult
white mice was not manifested without at least 17 serial pas-
sages in murine brains.18
Apart from that, from these early rodent studies,18 rela-
tively little is known about disease pathogenesis with ZIKV.
The use of animal models will be essential to understand ZIKV
pathogenesis and to screen antivirals and vaccines. To fill this
gap, we developed and characterized a mouse model of lethal
and nonlethal ZIKV infection in 3-, 5-, and 11-week-old immu-
nocompromised mice lacking the receptor for type I interferon

 (IFN α/β) (A129 mice) or types I and II IFN (IFN α/β/γ)
(AG129 mice). These models represent a first step toward
developing the tools to test potential therapeutic measures and
potentially for understanding severe neurological outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells. Vero cells (obtained from ATCC, Bethesda, MD)
were propagated as previously described in a study.19 Cul-
tures were maintained at 37°C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s
minimum essential medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5%
fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin (P/S;
100 Units/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively). C6/36 cells were
cultured in DMEM with 5% FBS, 1% tryptose phosphate
broth, and P/S and maintained at 28°C with 5% CO2.
Viruses. The Asian lineage FSS13025 was obtained from
the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arbo-
viruses (WRCEVA, Galveston, TX). It was amplified once in
C6/36 mosquito cells from the lyophilized stock and once in
Vero cells. All viruses were detected by titration on Vero cells,
immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of viral replication foci,
or crystal violet staining of plaques.
Animals. Mice. CD1 mice (Charles River Laboratories,
Wilmington, MA) at 3 weeks of age were injected subcutane-
ously in the back with 1 × 104 plaque-forming units (PFU).
Six-week-old C57Bl/6J (Jackson laboratories, Bar Harbor,
ME) were injected either subcutaneously or in the footpad
with 1 × 104 PFU. A129 and AG129 mice were obtained from
colonies maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at
University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB; Galveston, TX).
The 3-week-old AG129 (each dose, N = 3) and 3-week-old
(N = 11), 5-week-old (N = 6), or 11-week-old (N = 3) A129
were infected with 1 × 105 PFU/mouse by the intraperitoneal
(IP) or intradermal (ID) routes. Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
was used to dilute the stocks to the desired concentrations,
and inocula were back-titrated to verify the dose given. Mock-
infected controls were given PBS by the same routes as follows:
AG129 (ID N = 1, IP N = 2) and A129 (3-week, N = 2; 5-week,
N = 1; and 11-week, N = 1). Mice that were killed to determine
organ loads were perfused with PBS as previously described.20
All mice were monitored at least once daily for signs of ill-
ness (lethargy, ruffled fur, hunched posture, and neurological
signs and symptoms such as paralysis and tremors); weights
and temperatures were recorded daily. Blood (∼70 μL) was
collected from the retro-orbital sinus of anesthetized mice
(daily for the group but no more than every other day for each
individual mouse) and clarified by centrifugation for 5 minutes
at 3,380 × g. Serum was transferred to a sterile tube and frozen
at −80°C before titration. Mice were considered moribund
if they did not respond to stimuli, had neurological disease
(partial paralysis, tremors, unsteady gait, and/or falling) or
lost more than 20% of their initial weight (consistent with
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee [IACUC] pro-
tocol). Mice found dead were recorded as dead that same day,
while moribund mice were recorded as dead the next day.
In addition, some mice were euthanized at various intervals
after infection to determine the viral load in their tissues as
described in the protocol. All animal testing was performed in
accordance UTMB policy as approved by the UTMB IACUC.
Organ titration. Organ titrations were performed as previ-
ously described in a study.20 In brief, 500 μL of DMEM with
2% FBS and P/S along with a steel ball bearing were placed
in a 2-mL Eppendorf tube. The organ (whole or part) was
placed in the tube. Tubes were weighed, and organ weight
was determined by subtracting the tube weight. Tissues were
homogenized in a Qiagen TissueLyser II shaking at 26 p/second
for 5 minutes (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The homoge-
nate was clarified by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 3,380 × g
and titrated on Vero monolayer as described in below section
Titration. The titer was then adjusted for volume and organ
weight to report the organ loads as PFU/g.
Titration. Titrations were performed on Vero monolayers
in either 12- or 24-well plates, as previously described.19 The
virus was 10-fold diluted in DMEM with 2% FBS and P/S in
96-well plates. Monolayers were infected with 100 μL of diluent
for 1 hour at 37°C and overlaid with 4% methylcellulose in
DMEM. Three or 4 days later, the overlay was removed,
monolayers were rinsed once with PBS, and fixed for at least
1 hour with a 50:50 v/v mixture of methanol and acetone.
Viruses were detected either by direct visualization of plaques
on monolayers following crystal violet staining or IHC staining
for antigenic foci (see below section).
IHC method to detect ZIKV infection. Fixed monolayers
were washed three times for 15 minutes with PBS on a rocking
shaker, followed by blocking with Dulbecco’s phosphate-
buffered saline containing 3% FBS for 15 minutes. Mono-
layers were treated overnight with a ZIKV hyperimmune mouse
ascitic fluid (obtained through the WRCEV
A) diluted 1:2,000 in
blocking solution, then washed three more times, 15 minutes
each, with PBS. Peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary
antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc. (Gaithersburg,
MD)) diluted 1:2,000 in blocking buffer was added to mono-
layers for 1 hour. Following the incubation, the plates were
washed a final three times with PBS and developed using an
AEC peroxidase substrate kit (Enzo, Farmingdale, NY) pre-
pared to the manufacturer’s standards. Plates were developed on
a rocking shaker in the dark and dried before counting pink foci.
Statistics. All statistical analyses were conducted using JMP
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC). To analyze changes in weight, values
were transformed to percent (%) weight relative to initial weight
on day 0, and then treatments were compared with a repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Viremia was com-
pared among treatments on different days using a two-factor
ANOVA, as most mice were not sampled repeatedly for vire-
mia. Tukey–Kramer post hoc tests were used to discern differ-
ences among individual treatments.
RESULTS
Characterizing ZIKV in adult immunocompetent mice. To
characterize ZIKV in immunocompetent mice, a low-passage
virus (FSS13025) that phylogenetically groups with the Asian
Lineage1 was used. FSS13025 was isolated from a sick child in
Cambodia in 2010.21 Three-week-old CD1 mice injected sub-
cutaneously with 1 × 104 PFU of FSS13025 were observed
daily for signs of illness, weighed, and bled to determine
viremia. None developed any signs of illness (hunched pos-
ture, ruffled fur, or lethargy), and all mice either gained or
maintained their weight (Figure 1). There was no significant
interaction between treatment (MOCK or ZIKV infected)
and day postinoculation (df = 9, F = 1.26, P = 0.28) nor any
significant difference between treatments (df = 1, F = 0.01,
P = 0.92). There was a significant effect of day postinocu-
lation (df = 9, F = 329.71, P < 0.0001), and weight increased
1363
DEVELOPMENT OF MURINE ZIKA MODEL
 significantly each day postinoculation in both MOCK- and
ZIKV-infected mice. No virus was detected in the blood of any
infected mice. It is unlikely that a higher titer inoculum would
have resulted in viremia or disease. A similar experiment was
conducted in 6-week-old C57Bl/6J mice with another Asian
lineage virus from Malaysia with similar results (data not shown).
Susceptibility of A129 mice to ZIKV. The absence of disease
and virus replication in immunocompetent mice prompted the
use of the A129 mouse model. These mice lack the IFNα/β
receptor, rendering them incapable of responding to type I
IFN, and have been used successfully to characterize the
infection of other viruses that produce mild or no disease in
immunocompetent mice.20,22–24 To characterize this model,
A129 mice of different ages were injected IP with 1 × 105
PFU of the FSS13025 isolate. Mice were monitored daily for
signs of illness, changes in weight (Figure 2A), bled daily
for 5 days to measure viremia (Figure 2B), and mortality
was recorded (Figure 2C).
Infected mice of all ages showed signs of illness character-
ized by hunched posture and ruffled fur. However, severe
disease (e.g., tremors, lethargy, and anorexia) and mortality
were only observed in mice infected at 3 weeks of age. These

do not show signs of disease. Groups of 3-week-old CD1 mice were
infected with 1 × 104 plaque-forming units subcutaneously and weighed
daily. Mice MOCK infected with phosphate-buffered saline (N = 2) are

 signs were coincident with changes in weight; infected mice
failed to gain weight for the first 4 days of infection and began
to lose weight on day 5, which continued until they succumbed
to illness (Figure 2A). All MOCK-infected 3-week-old mice
gained weight steadily over the monitoring period. Mice aged
5 and 11 weeks also showed signs of disease but were never
lethargic. Weight loss was greater in the 5-week-old than the
11-week-old mice, but both age groups started to recover
weight from day 8 postinfection (PI). We conducted statistical
comparison of weight change among four treatment groups:
MOCK-infected at 3 weeks of age, ZIKV-infected at 3 weeks
of age, ZIKV-infected at 5 weeks of age, and ZIKV-infected at
11 weeks of age. The MOCK-infected mice of 5 and 11 weeks
of age were excluded from this analysis because of small mouse
numbers. Because animals were removed from the experiment
for analysis of viremia, it was possible to analyze weight change
only between days 1 and 5 PI. In addition, weights were not
measured for the 11-week-old mice on day 5 PI; we assumed
for purposes of analysis that day 5 weight in this group was
equal to day 4 weight. There was a significant interaction
between treatment and day PI (df = 4, F = 2.55, P = 0.007):
the weight gain in MOCK-infected mice on day 5 was signifi-
cantly greater than the weight gain of 3- or 5-week-old mice
infected with ZIKV at any days PI but the weight gain of
MOCK-infected mice did not differ from 11-week-old mice
infected with ZIKV at any day PI.
Figure 2B shows the change in viremia over time in each
age group of mice. Peak viremia was seen on day 2 PI and
declined thereafter. No samples were taken from 5-week-old
mice after day 5 so it was unclear how long viremia lasted
in this age group. All 3-week-old mice were moribund on
day 6. The 11-week-old group included only one mouse at
this time point and thus was not included in statistical analysis.
There was no significant interaction between the effects of
age group (3- or 5-week-old) and day PI (days 1–5) on vire-
mia (df = 4, F = 1.26, P = 0.31). Three- and 5-week-old mice
did not differ in levels of viremia (df = 1, F = 0.09, P = 0.77),
but viremia did change significantly with day PI (df = 4,
F = 196.85, P < 0.0001).
All 3-week-old mice died of ZIKV infection, with a mean
time to death of approximately 6 days (Figure 2C). The 50%
mortality reported for the 5-week-old mice may be mislead-
ing since these were not natural deaths, but rather the fulfill-
ment of IACUC morbidity criteria. In these cases, mice had
lost more than 20% of their initial weight and euthanasia was
required. It is uncertain if these mice would have recovered if
euthanasia was not performed. None of the 11-week-old mice
succumb to illness or met criteria for euthanasia.
Partial paralysis in AG129 mice after ZIKV infection through
various routes. Mice lacking type I and II IFN responsiveness
have been used successfully to model arbovirus infection
such as DENV25 and yellow fever virus,26 where utilization
of immunocompetent models has not been possible. To evalu-
ate whether this model would be useful for ZIKV, 3-week-old
AG129 animals were infected either via the IP or ID route
with 1 × 105 PFU and monitored as previously described. All
mice looked healthy until day 4 when the IP-injected mice
began to show signs of ruffled fur. By day 5, all mice were
visibly ill and lost weight (Figure 3A) but were responsive
to stimuli and interested in food. There was a significant
interaction between treatment (MOCK-infected, either IP or
ID; ZIKV IP or ID) and day postinoculation (df = 8, F = 24.90,
P < 0.0001). Overlap between treatments over time was com-
plex, but the treatments showed statistically significant separa-
tion by a post hoc test on day 5 PI. We therefore compared
the percent weight change among the treatments on day 5
with a one-factor ANOVA (df = 2, F = 33.47, P = 0.0006); a
Tukey–Kramer post hoc test showed that each treatment
differed significantly from every other, with MOCK-infected
mice gaining the most weight relative to weight at day 0,
mice infected IP gaining significantly less weight, and mice
infected ID losing weight.
Disease severity increased daily, and by day 6, all mice
showed signs of neurologic disease characterized by “toe-
walking,” tremors, and loss of balance. Regardless of route,
all infected mice died by day 6 (Figure 3C).
Viremia was observed in all infected AG129 mice, and
the peak day differed based upon infection route (Figure 3B).
IP-injected mice had a peak on day 2, similar to that pro-
duced in A129 mice. ID infection delayed peak viremia to
day 3. Regardless, peak serum titers for IP and ID mice were
similar: 4.1 × 107 PFU/mL and 4.7 × 107 PFU/mL, respectively.
These data were not subjected to statistical analysis due to low
numbers (N = 1 for each time point).
A129 organ loads. Three-week-old mice were serially eutha-
nized, and virus loads were determined for the heart, lung,
liver, spleen, kidney, muscle (right quadricep), brain, and, in
males, testis. Cardiac perfusion was performed on days 1–3 to
reduce contamination from viremia. Figure 4 shows the levels
of virus in various tissues and the gender and health of the
mice at time of necropsy. Although all sampled organs con-
tained virus, the main sites of ZIKV replication were the spleen,
testes, and brain. High replication in the spleen was seen
as early as day 1 with peak titers on day 3. Virus was first
observed in the brain on day 3, and titers continued to rise
until morbidity on day 6. The testis of male mice also ampli-
fied virus to high titers, beginning on day 2 and continuing
until death and approaching 1 × 108 PFU/g. No reproductive
tissues were harvested from female mice. Gross examination
upon necropsy showed only one mouse with a slightly enlarged
spleen. All other tissues appeared normal.
AG129 organ loads. Moribund ID-infected AG129 on day
6 PI were necropsied and organs were titrated as done for
A129 mice (Figure 5). Virus replication was observed in all
tissues with the highest viral loads found in the brain and the
testis with average titers of approximately 1 × 107 PFU/g tissue.
The pattern of dissemination was similar to that in A129 ani-
mals but organ titers were on the average lower. Viremia in all
three mice was approximately 1 × 104 PFU/mL serum.
Comparison of A129 and AG129 mice. Overall, there was
very little difference between the disease and virulence of
ZIKV in A129 and AG129 mice. The only notable differ-
ence was the severity of the neurologic symptoms seen in
the AG129 mice, but this observation cannot be quantified at
this time. The A129 mice became lethargic and unresponsive
to stimuli before death or euthanasia. The AG129, however,
were active and interested in food before death, but remained
uncoordinated. Additional experiments will be needed to
further evaluate these observations. There was no difference
between A129 and AG129 mice, infected IP at 3 weeks of
age, in weight change PI (repeated measures ANOVA, df = 1,
F = 0.02, P = 0.90) or time to death (Fisher’s exact test, N = 8,
P = 1.0). Time to death was treated as a categorical variable
because all three of the AG129 mice and four of the five
1365
DEVELOPMENT OF MURINE ZIKA MODEL
 A129 mice died on day 6 PI. It was not possible to conduct
statistical analysis on viremia in the two groups because vire-
mia was quantified in only one AG129 mouse. Furthermore,
there was no statistical difference in the mean organ titers
obtained from moribund A129 or AG129 on day 6 (Student’s
t test; Supplemental Figure 1).
DISCUSSION
Herein, we describe the first ZIKV animal model reported
since the 1950s and expand upon those initial findings of rep-
lication ZIKV replication in white mice. The mice used then,
as well as CD1 mice used here, show no overt signs of illness
in adults infected via a peripheral route.18 Mice lacking types I
and/or II IFN were shown to have signs of disease and neu-
rological involvement. They also produced high titer viremia
and significant viral loads in key organs. This disease was age
dependent as older mice did not succumb to infection and
showed little disease.
The use of immunocompromised mice is not ideal for
describing the pathogenesis of ZIKV. For this, other species
including nonhuman primates are likely needed. However,
there are anecdotal cases where individuals with underlying
health complications succumb to fatal ZIKV infection, includ-
ing one documented case of a 15-year-old girl with sickle cell
anemia.27 However, the A129 and AG129 models appear to
be well suited to screen antiviral compounds and test vaccine
efficacy. The younger mice can be used to demonstrate that
antiviral compounds are effective in preventing weight loss,
neurological disease, viremia, and/or death. AG129 mice have
previously been used for this purpose to evaluate the role of a
nucleoside analog in preventing death from DENV.28 Mice can
be vaccinated when they are approximately 3–4 weeks of age
and challenged to measure protection at 7–8 weeks or later.
This approach using immunocompromised mice was used to
evaluate chikungunya vaccines.29 In this A129 model, metrics
for vaccine efficacy could include protection from weight loss
and signs of disease as well as reduced or no viremia.

 Not surprisingly, high viral loads were noted in several
organs, including the spleen, brain, and testes. The presence
of virus in the brain slightly preceded the appearance of neu-
rological signs by 2 days. Similar kinetics were also noted with
another neurotropic flavivirus (Murray Valley encephalitis
virus) in A129 mice.30 Brains from 5-week-old Swiss Webster
mice inoculated intracranially with the MP 1751 strain of ZIKV
were examined histologically and found infected astroglial cells
throughout the cortex.31 Samples for histology were also taken
as part of our study to elucidate the portions of the brain
affected by ZIKV in this lethal model.
In our study, ZIKV also preferentially replicated in the
testes of male mice to surprisingly high titers. This finding
might support recent reports of sexual human transmission
from male to female.15,16,32 The samples taken here were early
in the disease course and from the 3-week-old mice, which
succumbed to illness. It is worth noting that another arbovirus,
Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), replicates in the
testes of infected hamsters but was not suspected to be sexu-
ally transmitted,33 so the presence of virus here does not imply
transmission via semen. Indeed, males that receive the TC-83
vaccine against VEEV are asked to abstain from sex for
30 days due to the potential for virus shedding. The unknown
potential for ZIKV transmission during intercourse, espe-
cially to a serologically naive pregnant female, prompted the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend
new guidelines for males with Zika disease.34 The 5- and/or
11-week-old AG129 model might help answer some of these
questions and provide a timeline for active virus shedding.
ZIKV has also been found in the urine35 and saliva36 of
patients. Infectious virions or genetic material from arbo-
viruses such as
West Nile virus and CHIKV are found in
these excretions from humans37–39 and animal models.39–41
It is unclear if these secretions play a role in virus transmis-
sion, but they can serve as a noninvasive sample to test for
infection. Urine and saliva were not evaluated as part of our
study but are planned for the future.
The role of IFN on Zika disease is beginning to be under-
stood. Pretreating primary skin fibroblasts with exogenous
IFNα, β, or γ reduces ZIKV replication in a dose-dependent
manner,42 showing that ZIKV is susceptible to IFN in vitro.
In addition, ZIKV induces the production of IFNα and β in
these cells.42 Given the protective role of type I and/or II

 IFNs, it is not surprising that mice lacking the ability to
respond to these molecules have increased susceptibility.
Mean time to death (6 days) upon infection with ZIKV is
similar between A129 and AG129 mice. However, the dis-
ease in AG129 mice is dominated by strong neurological
symptoms. Although differences in the mouse genetic back-
ground (129 versus C57Bl/6) cannot be ruled out as the pri-
mary influence behind the severity of neurologic disease, the
possible neuroprotective role of IFNγ against ZIKV infection
of neural tissue can likewise not be ignored. It has previously
been established in models of DENV infection that the pres-
ence of IFNγ receptors is critical to the clearance of DENV
from the central nervous system (CNS) despite being dispens-
able for systemic clearance, indicating a possible similar role
in ZIKV CNS infection.43 It is also an important signaling
pathway to protection against VEEV-caused encephalitis in
the mouse model.44 A survey of the cytokines produced in
ZIKV-infected patients showed the presence of IFNγ from
early time points through recovery phase, suggesting that
the sustained presence of IFNγ might be important.45 Addi-
tional studies are needed to elucidate the role of the innate
immune response in ZIKV infection.
To our knowledge, this is the first description of using
immunocompromised mice to model ZIKV infection, and one
of the few manuscripts available detailing rodent infections.
These models should be refined, but they provide an initial
platform for the immediate in vivo screening of antivirals and
vaccines for ZIKV.
