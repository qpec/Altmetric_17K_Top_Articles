Abstract
Introduction: We aimed to determine the prospective association of smoking status, smoking 
intensity, and smoking cessation with the risk of hearing loss in a large Japanese cohort.
Methods:  
The cohort study included 50 
195 employees, who were aged 20–64 years and free of hear-
ing loss at baseline. Participants were followed up for a maximum of 8 years. Pure-tone audiometric 
testing was performed annually to identify hearing loss at 1 and 4 kHz. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models were used to investigate the association between smoking and hearing loss.
Results: During follow-up, 3532 individuals developed high-frequency hearing loss, and 1575 
developed low-frequency hearing loss. 
The hazard ratio (HR) associated with current smokers was 
1.6 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5 to 1.7) and 1.2 (95% CI = 1.1 to 1.4) for high- and low-frequency 
hearing loss, respectively, as compared with never smokers. The risk of high- and low-frequency 
hearing loss increased with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (both p for trend <.001). 
The HR associated with former smokers was 1.2 (95% CI = 1.1 to 1.3) and 0.9 (95% CI = 0.8 to 1.1)

for high- and low-frequency hearing loss, respectively. The analysis by quitting years showed a 
decline in risk of hearing loss after quitting smoking, even among those who quitted less than 
5 years before baseline.
Conclusions: Smoking is associated with increased risk of hearing loss, especially at the high 
frequency, in a dose–response manner. The excess risk of hearing loss associated with smoking 
disappears in a relatively short period after quitting.
Implications: The prospective association between smoking and hearing loss has not been well 
studied. 
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the largest to date investigating the association 
between smoking and incident hearing loss. Our results indicate that smoking is associated with 
increased risk of hearing loss in a dose–response manner. Quitting smoking virtually eliminates 
the excess risk of hearing loss, even among quitters with short duration of cessation. 
These results 
suggest that smoking may be a causal factor for hearing loss, although further research would be 
required to confirm this. If so, this would emphasize the need for tobacco control to prevent or 
delay the development of hearing loss.
Introduction
Hearing loss is an important public health and societal concern. It 
adversely affects interpersonal communication, social interaction, 
psychosocial well-being, and quality of life1 and is ranked as the 
fourth leading cause of years lived with disability globally.2 Many 
people with hearing loss receive inadequate treatment or rehabilita-
tion, even in high-income countries,3,4 and the current production 
of hearing aids meets less than 10% of the global need.5 The World 
Health Organization estimated that more than 5% of the world’s 
population has disabling hearing loss.6 In Japan, one study showed 
that about 10% of workers aged 40–79 years had hearing loss at 
1 or 4 kHz.7 Thus, identifying modifiable risk factors related to 
hearing loss is important for reducing the burden of hearing loss. 
Experimental studies suggested that smoking may affect the audi-
tory system by direct ototoxicity of nicotine,8,9 cochlear ischemia due 
to increased levels of carboxyhemoglobin,10 and smoking-mediated 
increased blood viscosity.11
A meta-analysis of five cross-sectional studies showed that cur-
rent smokers were more likely to have hearing loss.12 However, 
evidence from prospective studies conflicts. Of eight cohort studies 
on the associations between smoking and hearing loss,13–20 only 
three reported a significant positive association.18–20 Of five cohort 
studies that assessed the dose–response association between 
smoking intensity and hearing loss,14,17–20 only two found a dose–
response relationship.19,20 Cohort studies based on self-reported 
hearing loss found that past smoking was also associated with 
hearing loss,17,20 whereas cohort studies with audiometric assess-
ments did not detect risk elevation among past smokers.18,19 All 
these cohort studies had some limitations, including relatively 
small sample sizes (500–2000 participants),13–16,18,19 short follow-
up period (≤5 years),15,16,19,20 or self-reported hearing loss.17,20 To 
understand better the association between smoking and hearing 
loss, large-scale studies using audiometry over long periods of 
follow-up are needed.
In Japan, employees are required by law to receive an annual 
health examination, including a hearing test. This provides a valu-
able opportunity to identify potentially modifiable risk factors asso-
ciated with hearing loss. The purpose of the present study was to 
determine the prospective association of smoking status, smoking 
intensity, and smoking cessation with the risk of hearing loss in a 
large working population-based cohort study with up to 8 years of 
follow-up.
Methods
Study Design
The Japan Epidemiology Collaboration on Occupational Health 
(J-ECOH) Study is an ongoing, multicenter epidemiologic study 
among workers from 12 companies covering various industries (elec-
tric machinery and apparatus manufacturing; steel, chemical, gas, 
and nonferrous metal manufacturing; automobile and instrument 
manufacturing; plastic product manufacturing; and health care). In 
Japan, workers are obliged to undergo a health checkup at least once 
a year under the Industrial Safety and Health Act; nearly all workers 
attend their health checkup each year. Participants in the J-ECOH 
Study received anthropometric measurements, physical examination 
including hearing test, and laboratory examination (blood glucose, 
blood lipids, etc) during the health checkup. Checkup participants 
also completed a questionnaire about medical history, health-related 
lifestyle, and work environment. The details of the J-ECOH Study 
have been described previously.21,22 As of May 2016, 11 participating 
companies (12 worksites) provided health checkup data obtained 
between January 2008 and December 2015 or between April 2008 
and March 2016.
Prior to the collection of data, the conduct of the J-ECOH Study 
was announced in each company by using posters that explained 
the purpose and procedure of the study. Participants did not provide 
their verbal or written informed consent to join the study but were 
allowed to refuse their participation. This procedure conforms to the 
Japanese Ethical Guidelines for Epidemiological Research, where the 
procedure of obtaining consent may be simplified for observational 
studies using existing data. The study protocol including consent 
procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National 
Center for Global Health and Medicine, Japan.
In this study, the data from the earliest health checkup (mostly 
carried out in 2008) were regarded as the baseline data; however, if 
the 2008 dataset contained a large amount of missing data, the data 
from the 2009 or 2010 (one company each) health checkup were 
used as the baseline. The outcome of the present prospective analysis 
was ascertained using data from the health checkups after the base-
line and through March 2016.
Study Participants
As shown in Supplementary Figure S1, of 92 
823 participants aged 
20–64 years, we excluded participants from one company for 
which data on hearing tests were not available, and participants

from another two companies for which there was no information 
on past smoking. Of participants in the remaining eight companies 
(n = 80 
323), we excluded those who had hearing loss (defined as 
hearing thresholds at 1 kHz >30 dB or at 4 kHz >40 dB in at least 
one ear) or lacked data on the hearing test at baseline. Of the remain-
ing 59 
333 participants, we excluded participants with missing data 
on smoking, with self-reported cancer, and with missing data nec-
essary for the diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia 
that were used in the main analysis. We further excluded partici-
pants who did not attend any subsequent health checkups or who 
attended but did not receive a hearing test. Finally, 50 
195 partici-
pants remained for our first set of analyses to assess the association 
between the risk of hearing loss among former and current smokers 
and that for never smokers. In the second set of analyses, to assess 
the association between smoking intensity among current smokers 
(number of cigarettes smoked per day) and the risk of hearing loss, 
data were available for seven companies (n = 39 
112). In the third 
set of analyses, which focused on duration of smoking cessation and 
the risk of hearing loss, data were available for two major companies 
(n = 34 
912).
Assessment of Smoking Status
Smoking status (never, former, or current) was identified by a self-
administered questionnaire at baseline. Of seven companies where 
the number of cigarettes smoked per day was further asked, four 
companies collected data on daily cigarette consumption in a con-
tinuous scale, and the other three companies used a categorical 
question (≤10, 11–20, or >20 cigarettes/day). Of two companies 
where duration of smoking cessation was available, participants in 
one company self-reported years since quitting; in the other com-
pany, participants self-reported age at quitting. Years since quitting 
were thus calculated as age at baseline visit minus the recalled age 
at quitting.
Assessment and Definition of Hearing Loss
As part of an annual health checkup, pure-tone audiometric test-
ing was performed by trained audiometric technicians using a pure 
tone audiometer. The types of audiometers used in each worksite are 
provided in Supplementary Table S1. Participants received a hearing 
test for each ear at frequencies of 1 and 4 kHz to check whether 
their hearing thresholds exceed the thresholds recommended by the 
Japanese government guideline (>30 dB at 1 kHz and >40 dB at 
4 kHz). http://labor.tank.jp/anei/sisinetc/souon-guideline.html (in 
Japanese, accessed May 2017).
Given that smoking appears to be more strongly related vato 
high-frequency hearing loss than low-frequency hearing loss,19,23–25 
we treated high- and low-frequency hearing loss separately. We 
defined low-frequency hearing loss as a hearing threshold of more 
than 30 dB at 1 kHz and high-frequency hearing loss as a hearing 
threshold of more than 40 dB at 4 kHz in at least one ear (unilateral 
hearing loss). In addition, we alternatively defined hearing loss in 
both ears (bilateral hearing loss).
Assessment of Covariates
Covariates included age, sex, worksite, body mass index (BMI), his-
tory of cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and 
dyslipidemia. The body height and weight were measured using a 
scale while the participant wore light clothes and no shoes. BMI was 
calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the squared height 
in meters. History of CVD was identified on the basis of self-report 
of stroke and ischemic heart disease (angina and myocardial infarc-
tion). Blood pressure (BP) was measured with the participants in a 
sitting position using an automatic BP monitor. Plasma glucose was 
measured with either the enzymatic or glucose oxidase peroxida-
tive electrode method. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured 
using a latex agglutination immunoassay, high-performance liquid 
chromatography, or the enzymatic method. Triglyceride, low-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 
levels were measured with the enzymatic method. All the labora-
tories involved in the health checkups of the participating compa-
nies had received satisfactory scores (rank A or a score of >95 out 
of 100) from external quality-control agencies. Hypertension was 
defined as systolic BP ≥140 mmHg, diastolic BP ≥90 mmHg, or 
receiving medical treatment for hypertension.26 Diabetes was defined 
as HbA1c ≥6.5%, fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl, random 
plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dl, or currently under medical treatment for 
diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association criteria for 
the diagnosis of diabetes.27 Dyslipidemia was defined as triglyceride 
level ≥150 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level ≥140 mg/
dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level <40 mg/dl, or receiv-
ing medical treatment for dyslipidemia, based on the criteria for the 
Japan Atherosclerosis Society.28
Because questions on lifestyle (except for smoking) and work 
environment were markedly different across the participating com-
panies, these factors were adjusted for a sensitivity analysis using 
data in one company (n = 31 
440). Averaged daily alcohol consump-
tion was calculated as drinking frequency multiplied by ethanol con-
sumption per drinking day. Weekly minutes of leisure time physical 
activity were calculated as frequency of physical activity multiplied 
by duration of the activity engaged per day and summed across up 
to 20 activities, as described elsewhere.29 Participants were asked to 
select up to five characteristics of worksite environments among a 
list of 14 items (hot, cold, noisy, etc). Occupational noise exposure 
was identified if “noisy” was selected by the participant.
Statistical Analyses
Characteristics of the study participants were described as means 
for continuous variables and percentages for categorical variables. 
Pearson chi-square test for categorical variables or analysis of vari-
ance for continuous variables was used to examine differences in 
baseline characteristics among never smokers, former smokers, and 
current smokers.
Person-time was calculated from the date of the baseline exami-
nation to the date of the first diagnosis of hearing loss in a subse-
quent examination or to the date of the last examination, whichever 
occurred first. We used the Cox proportional hazards model to esti-
mate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for inci-
dent hearing loss by categories of smoking status, considering never 
smoker as the reference category. The first model was adjusted for 
baseline age (years, continuous), sex, and worksite. The second model 
(main analysis) was additionally adjusted for BMI (kg/m2, continu-
ous), CVD (yes or no), hypertension (yes or no), diabetes (yes or no), 
and dyslipidemia (yes or no). We further adjusted for occupational 
noise exposure (yes or no), alcohol intake (<23 or ≥23 g ethanol/
day), and leisure time physical activity (<150 or ≥150 min/week) in a 
sensitivity analysis using data from one major company. Interaction 
of smoking and occupational noise exposure on hearing loss was 
examined in the sensitivity analysis. Population attributable fraction 
(PAF) was calculated using the formula: PAF = pd [(HR − 1)/HR],

in which pd is the proportion of cases exposed to the risk factor and 
HR is the adjusted HR in the second model.30
Multivariable-adjusted HRs for incident hearing loss by cat-
egories of smoking intensity who smoked 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and 
>20 cigarettes/day, compared with persons who never smoked, 
were estimated. Tests for trends were performed by treating the cat-
egories of smoking intensity as ordinal numbers and modeling this 
variable as a continuous variable. To assess the association between 
smoking cessation and the risk of hearing loss, we classified past 
smokers into three groups according to years since quitting: <5, 5 
to 9, and ≥10 years. We decided not to further divide those who 
quitted ≥10 years before baseline into subgroups after consider-
ing the distribution of quitting years (14% with 10–14 years, 8% 
with 15–19 years, and 18% with ≥20 years) and confirming similar 
associations with hearing loss among these subgroups. All statistical 
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, 
NC). A two-sided p < .05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Table 1 shows baseline characteristics of the study population by 
smoking status. Former smokers were older and had higher BMI, 
BP, and blood glucose. Correspondingly, former smokers had higher 
prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and CVD than never smokers 
and current smokers. Current smokers were more likely to report 
occupational noise than their counterparts.
Smoking Status and Risk of Hearing Loss
Table 2 shows adjusted HRs for incident unilateral hearing loss 
according to baseline smoking status. During a maximum of 8 years 
of follow-up, 3532 (7.0%) individuals developed unilateral high-
frequency hearing loss, and 1575 (3.1%) developed unilateral low-
frequency hearing loss, corresponding to an incident rate of 12.2 
and 5.3 per 1000 person-years, respectively. After adjusting for age, 
sex, worksite, BMI, CVD, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, 
the HRs for high-frequency hearing loss were 1.2 (95% CI = 1.1 
to 1.3) in former smokers and 1.6 (95% CI = 1.5 to 1.7) in current 
smokers compared with never smokers. For low-frequency hearing 
loss, the adjusted HRs were 0.9 (95% CI = 0.8 to 1.1) in former 
smokers and 1.2 (95% CI = 1.1 to 1.4) in current smokers. Similar 
associations were observed after further adjustment for occupational 
noise exposure, alcohol intake, and leisure time physical activity in 
the sensitivity analysis. The interaction between smoking and occu-
pational noise exposure was not statistically significant. The PAF of 
high- and low-frequency hearing loss onset due to current smoking 
were 17.5% and 6.6%, respectively.
Smoking Intensity and Risk of Hearing Loss
Figure 1 shows adjusted HRs for incident unilateral hearing loss 
according to baseline smoking intensity. Compared with never 
smokers, the adjusted HRs of high-frequency hearing loss among 
persons who smoked 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and more than 20 cigarettes/
day were 1.4 (95% CI = 1.2 to 1.6), 1.6 (95% CI = 1.5 to 1.8), and 
1.7 (95% CI = 1.5 to 2.0), respectively (Supplementary Table S2). 
Regarding low-frequency hearing loss, the adjusted HRs were 1.1 
(95% CI = 0.9 to 1.4), 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0 to 1.4), and 1.4 (95% 
CI = 1.1 to 1.8) for persons who smoked 1 to 10, 11 to 20, and 
more than 20 cigarettes/day, respectively. The risk of both high- and 
low-frequency hearing loss increased significantly as the number of 
cigarettes smoked per day increased (both p for trend <.001).
Smoking Cessation and Risk of Hearing Loss
Figure 2 shows a rapid decline in risk of hearing loss among people 
who quit <5 years before baseline compared with current smokers. 
For high-frequency hearing loss, the HRs of hearing loss decreased 
from 1.6 (95% CI = 1.4 to 1.7) for current smokers to 1.2 (95%

to 1.1) for people who quit <5, 5 to 9, and ≥10 years before, respec-
tively, compared with never smokers.
Bilateral Hearing Loss
Similar association patterns were observed when we alternatively 
defined hearing loss in both ears, although the associations between 
smoking and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss were not statisti-
cally significant (Supplementary Table S4, and Figures S2 and S3).
Discussion
Based on a large-scale cohort study among a Japanese working 
population, we demonstrated that smoking is associated with an 
increased risk of hearing loss in a dose–response manner. The magni-
tude of the association between smoking and high-frequency hearing 
loss was stronger than that of low-frequency hearing loss. The risk 
of hearing loss associated with smoking appears to decrease within 
5 years after quitting smoking. To our knowledge, the present study 
is the largest cohort study examining the association between smok-
ing and hearing loss.
In this study, current smokers had a significantly increased risk of 
hearing loss, even after adjustment for alcohol consumption, leisure 
time physical activity, and occupational noise exposure in sensitiv-
ity analysis, suggesting an independent association of smoking with 
hearing loss. Our findings are in line with the finding of a meta-
analysis based on five cross-sectional studies12 and those from recent 
cross-sectional studies23,24,31,32 published after that meta-analysis. 
Our results are also consistent with some18–20 but not all13–17 cohort 
studies. The heterogeneity of results between cohort studies might 
be because of the differences in the procedure of hearing assessment, 
follow-up period, covariate adjustment, study population, and sam-
ple size. With a large sample size, long follow-up period, and objec-
tive assessment of hearing loss, our study provides strong evidence 
that smoking is an independent risk factor for hearing loss.
We observed that the risk of hearing loss increased with cigarette 
consumption. In agreement with our findings, cross-sectional studies 
have reported that the odds ratios for hearing loss increased with the 
number of cigarettes smoked per day25 and pack-years.31,33 Of three 
cohort studies reporting a significant association between smoking and 
hearing loss, one did not find a dose–response relationship between

smoking and hearing loss, which is probably partly because of the 
small number of current smokers (n = 238),18 whereas the other two 
studies showed that HRs for hearing loss increased with the number 
of cigarettes smoked per day.19,20 Specifically, the cohort study among 
1554 male office workers in Japan showed that the HRs for high-
frequency hearing loss compared with never smokers were 1.8 (95% 
CI = 0.9 to 3.6), 2.0 (95% CI = 1.0 to 4.1), and 2.2 (95% CI = 1.1 to 
4.4) for people who smoked 1 to 20, 21 to 30, and ≥31 cigarettes/day, 
respectively, and the corresponding HRs for low-frequency hearing 
loss were 1.2 (95% CI = 0.7 to 2.3), 1.4 (95% CI = 0.7 to 2.6), and 
1.8 (95% CI = 1.0 to 3.4), respectively.19 A cohort study in Denmark, 
based on self-reported hearing loss among 4610 employees showed 
that the HRs for hearing loss were 1.6 (95% CI = 1.1 to 2.3) for peo-
ple who smoked <15 g/day, and 1.8 (95% CI = 1.3 to 2.5) for those 
who smoked ≥15 g/day, compared with never smokers.20 The dose–
response relationship observed in our study as well as in previous 
cohort studies19,20 adds evidence to support the finding that smoking 
is causally associated with hearing loss.
Consistent with previous cross-sectional23–25 and cohort19 studies, 
we observed that the magnitude of the association between smok-
ing and high-frequency hearing loss was stronger than that of the 
association between smoking and low-frequency hearing loss, sug-
gesting that smoking may have differential impact on high- and low- 
frequency hearing loss. Some explanations for this finding are pos-
sible. First, the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha9 and alpha10 
subunits are expressed primarily on outer (high frequency) hair 
cells, suggesting that tobacco may have a direct ototoxic effect on 
outer hair cell function.34 If this is the case, a similar adverse effect 
of electronic cigarettes on hearing as for tobacco smoking would be 
expected. Future research should explore the association between 
electronic cigarette use and hearing loss. Second, cigarette smok-
ing may damage the auditory system by cochlear ischemia due to 
increased levels of carboxyhemoglobin.10 Some studies suggested that 
the cochlea is more susceptible to ischemic change at its basal (high 
frequency) end.35,36 Third, high-frequency hearing loss was associated 
with high shear blood viscosity,37 which may be caused by smoking.
We observed that former smokers had a slightly increased risk of 
high-frequency hearing loss (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 1.1 to 1.3), but a 
similar risk of low-frequency hearing loss (HR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.8 
to 1.1), than never smokers, suggesting a modest association between 
past smoking and hearing loss. This finding is relatively consistent 
with previous cohort studies.17–20 In the further analysis by quitting 
years, we observed a rapid decline in the risk of hearing loss among 
people who quit <5 years before baseline compared with current 
smokers: HRs for high-frequency hearing loss decreased from 1.6 
(95% CI = 1.4 to 1.7) for current smokers to 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0 to 
1.4) for new quitters (<5 years) versus never smokers; HRs for low-
frequency hearing loss decreased from 1.2 (95% CI = 1.0 to 1.3) for 
current smokers to 0.9 (95% CI = 0.7 to 1.3) for new quitters ver-
sus never smokers. A previous cohort study showed that compared 
with never smokers, the HRs for hearing loss at 0.5–4 kHz were 1.4 
(95% CI = 1.1 to 1.8) for current smokers, 1.2 (95% CI = 0.9 to 
1.8) for people who stopped smoking <5 years before, and 1.1 (95% 
CI = 0.9 to 1.4) for those who stopped ≥5 years before.18 Taken 
together, quitting virtually eliminates the excess risk of hearing loss, 
even among quitters with short duration of cessation.
Strengths and Limitations of this Study
This study has several strengths including the large population-based 
cohort, long-term follow-up, use of audiometry to measure hear-
ing thresholds over time, and comprehensive covariate adjustment. 
However, several limitations warrant mention. First, because of a small 
number of participants who developed bilateral low-frequency hearing 
loss, the present study lacked power to detect significant associations 
between smoking and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss. However, 
the association patterns of smoking with unilateral and bilateral hear-
ing loss were similar. Second, smoking habits were ascertained via a 
questionnaire but not biologically verified (eg, exhaled carbon monox-
ide or salivary cotinine). Third, the existing yet limited studies showed 
that other lifestyle factors (eg, physical activity, alcohol drinking, expo-
sure to loud music) were associated with hearing loss.31,38 The lack or 
variation in questions on these data across participating companies 
did not allow us to control these factors in overall study subjects. In 
a sensitivity analysis using data of one major company, however, we 
confirmed that the association between smoking and hearing loss did 
not materially change after adjusting for physical activity and alcohol 
drinking. Fourth, data on occupational noise exposure was available 
only in one of the participating companies. Although an analysis with 
adjustment for noise exposure in that company showed little difference 
in the association between smoking and hearing loss, the subjective 
assessment of noise exposure should be acknowledged as a limitation. 
Fifth, because information regarding otologic diseases, head injuries, 
or drugs with potential impact on hearing acuity was not collected 
in a uniform manner, we were unable to exclude cases of hearing loss 
attributable to these above factors. Given that the hearing test was con-
ducted at only 1 and 4 kHz during health checkups, hearing loss at 
other frequencies could not be identified. Last, the majority of study 
participants were employees of large companies. Caution should thus 
be exercised in generalizing the present finding to workers in smaller 
companies, the self-employed, or the unemployed.
In conclusion, the present study indicates that smoking is associ-
ated with increased risk of hearing loss in a dose–response manner: 
The association is more pronounced for high-frequency hearing loss 
than for low-frequency hearing loss, and the excess risk of hearing 
loss decreases after quitting. These results, obtained from a large-scale 
prospective study, provide strong evidence to support that smoking is 
a causal factor for hearing loss and emphasize the need for tobacco 
control to prevent or delay the development of hearing loss.
