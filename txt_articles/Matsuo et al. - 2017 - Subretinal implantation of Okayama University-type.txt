ABSTRACT. Okayama University-type retinal prosthesis (OURePTM) is a photoelectric dye-coupled 
polyethylene film which generates electric potential in response to light and stimulates nearby 
neurons. This study aims to test surgical feasibility of subretinal implantation and functional 
durability of dye-coupled films in the subretinal space. The dye-coupled films were implanted 
subretinally by 25-gauge vitrectomy in the right eye of 11 normal beagle dogs: 2 dogs served 
for film removal after 5-month film implantation, 3 dogs for film removal after 3-month film 
implantation, 3 dogs for 3-month film implantation and pathological examination, and 3 dogs 
for sham surgery. The surface electric potential of the removed dye-coupled films in response 
to light was measured by the Kelvin Probe system. At surgery, rolled-up dye-coupled films in 5 
× 5 mm square size could be inserted into subretinal space of retinal detachment induced by 
fluid injection with a 38-gauge polyimide tip. Retinal attachment was maintained by silicone 
oil injection in vitreous cavity. At autopsy, the retina in all dogs maintained the ganglion cell 
layer, inner and outer nuclear layers while it lost the outer segments in some part. All 5 sheets 
of removed dye-coupled films maintained the dye color. One sheet of the 5-month implanted 
film showed proportional increase of surface potential in response to increasing light intensity. 
Subretinal implantation of OURePTM by vitrectomy was technically feasible in canine eyes, and 
OURePTM maintained the function of generating light-evoked surface potential after 5 months in 
subretinal implantation.
KEY WORDS: 38-gauge polyimide tip, vitrectomy, dog, dye-coupled thin film retinal prosthesis, 
photoelectric dye
Blind patients with hereditary retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa, have dead photoreceptor cells, but the other retinal 
neurons, which send axons to the brain, remain alive. Spontaneous retinal dystrophies, similar to the disease in the human, have 
been also described to occur in dogs [16]. The basic concept of retinal prostheses is to replace dead photoreceptor cells with 
artificial devices and to exploit the function of these living neurons, and finally to send messages to the brain, following artificial 
stimulation in response to light [9, 12, 20].
Okayama University-type retinal prosthesis (OURePTM) is a new type of retinal prostheses, so called photoelectric dye-
coupled thin film retinal prosthesis [1–3, 21–24]. Stable photoelectric dye molecules with absorption spectrum of visible light 
[8, 10, 13, 15] were chemically coupled to polyethylene film surface. The dye-coupled film generates electric potential in response 
to light and stimulates nearby neuronal cells to induce action potential. The dye-coupled film, as a light receiver and potential 
generator, implanted in subretinal space, is designed to replace the function of dead photoreceptor cells in retinal dystrophy 
[12, 20] and to send the signal to the brain through the living retinal ganglion cells and their axons as optic nerve fibers [9].
The main stream of retinal prosthesis utilizes a multielectrode array [7]. Camera-captured image is disintegrated to 60 pixels, 
and the electric current, corresponding to grayscale tone in each pixel, is outputted from 60 electrodes to stimulate the retinal living

neurons in Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System (Second Sight Medical Products, Inc., Sylmar, CA, U.S.A.). Surgical implantation 
of the multielectrode array indeed requires sophisticated techniques. In contrast, the dye-coupled film is a soft and thin sheet which 
would be rolled up and inserted in the subretinal space by vitrectomy [14].
In this study, the dye-coupled films were implanted subretinally in normal canine eyes and were also removed by vitrectomy in 
order to examine the feasibility of surgical techniques. In addition, spectrophotometric absorbance and light-evoked surface electric 
potential was examined on the dye-coupled films which were implanted for 3 or 5 months and then removed by vitrectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Preparation of dye-coupled polyethylene film
Thin films were made from polyethylene powder and exposed to fuming nitric acid to introduce carboxyl moieties on the film 
surface. Photoelectric dye molecules, 2-[2-[4-(dibutylamino) phenyl]ethenyl]-3-carboxymethylbenzothiazolium bromide (NK-5962, 
Hayashibara, Inc., Okayama, Japan), were coupled to carboxyl moieties of the polyethylene film surface via ethylenediamine, 
as described previously [3, 22, 23]. The fuming nitric acid-treated only polyethylene film and the photoelectric dye-coupled 
polyethylene film were designated as the plain film and the dye-coupled film, respectively. Films were manufactured in quality 
management system at a clean-room facility in Okayama University Incubator.
Animals
Eleven male beagle dogs (Kitayama Labes Co., Ina, Japan, or Beijing Marshall Biotechnology Co., Beijing, China) at the age 
ranging from 10 to 21 months (mean, 15.8 months), were used in the study: 2 dogs were assigned for 5-month dye-coupled film 
(OURePTM) implantation and its removal, 3 dogs for 3-month dye-coupled film implantation, 3 dogs for sham surgery, and 3 dogs 
for 3-month dye-coupled film implantation and its removal (Table 1). At sham surgery, all surgical procedures were done except for 
dye-coupled film implantation. All the surgeries were done only in the right eye. The dye-coupled films, removed by vitrectomy, 
were analyzed for spectrophotometric absorbance and light-evoked surface potential.
All animals were sacrificed with bleeding after overdose of intravenous thiopental (Ravonal, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma, Osaka, 
Japan), and the eyes were enucleated. Dogs with 3-month or 5-month film implantation and removal were euthanized 10 or 11 days 
after the second surgery for film removal. Dogs with 3-month film implantation or sham surgery were euthanized at 3 months 
after the initial surgery. After the cornea and iris were removed by circumferential incision of the eye ball, the posterior segment 
was cut meridionally to view the entire retina. The posterior segment was then fixed with phosphate-buffered 1% formaldehyde 
and 2.5% glutaraldehyde, stored in 10% neutral pH formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections were cut and stained 
with hematoxylin and eosin for pathological examinations. This study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee in 
Okayama University and also by the Committee at Ina Research, Inc., based on the Animal Welfare and Management Act in Japan.
Surgical procedures
Dogs were sedated with intramuscular medetomidine (0.02 mg/0.02 ml/kg of body weight, Domitor, Nippon Zenyaku Kogyo 
Co., Koriyama, Japan) and midazolam (0.3 mg/0.06 ml/kg of body weight, Dormicum, Astellas Pharma Inc., Tokyo, Japan), 
together with subcutaneous injection of meloxicam (0.5%, 0.2 mg/0.04 ml/kg of body weight, Metacam, Boehringer Ingelheim, 
Ingelheim am Rhein, Germany) as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug. At least 15 min after the sedation, dogs were 
anesthetized with intravenous pentobarbital (9.72 mg/kg of body weight, Somunopentyl 0.15 ml/kg, Kyoritsu Seiyaku Co., Tokyo, 
Japan), and intubated to maintain the airway. Mydriasis in the right eye was induced by 1% atropine (Nitten Pharmaceutical, 
Nagoya, Japan) instillation a day before surgery and on the day of surgery, together with 0.5% tropicamide and 0.5% phenylephrine 
eye drops (Mydrin-P, Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Osaka, Japan) on the day of surgery. Intramuscular ampicillin (125 mg/body, 
Viccillin, Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Tokyo, Japan) was given on the day of surgery and for the following 4 days. Postoperative

instillation of 0.5% levofloxacin (Cravit, Santen Pharmaceutical) and 0.1% betamethasone (Rinderon, Shionogi & Co., Osaka, 
Japan) twice daily as well as 1% atropine once daily was continued for postoperative one month.
After disinfection with 10% povidone iodine (Negmin Solution, Pfizer Japan, Tokyo) on the haired skin around the eye and then 
with 40-time saline-diluted povidone iodine on the ocular surface, the head was positioned with the nose upright and covered with 
a surgical drape. Topical anesthesia was further obtained with 4% lidocaine (Xylocaine Ophthalmic Solution, AstraZeneka, London, 
U.K.). Under a surgical microscope (OPMI VISU150, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Tokyo, Japan) with a surgical machine (Constellation 
Vision System, Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX, U.S.A.), anterior capsulectomy was done with a 25-gauge vitreous cutter 
under irrigation with a 25-gauge infusion cannula through two side ports which were made at the corneal limbus with a 20-gauge 
knife (V-Lance Knife, Alcon). Phacoemulsification and aspiration of the lens in the capsular bag was done through a 2.4 mm-wide 
corneal incision made on the superior side with a disposable knife (Safety Knife, Kai Medical, Seki, Japan). The corneal incision 
was sutured with 8–0 Vicryl (polyglactin 910, Ethicon, Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, U.S.A.). Three 25-gauge trocars 
were inserted into the vitreous through the conjunctiva and sclera 2.5 mm from the limbus on the superior to temporal side within 
120 degrees of meridian. The presence of a large vascularized nictitating membrane on the nasal side of the conjunctiva limited the 
surgical area used for placing trocars.
The wide-field fundus was viewed with a +128-diopter front lens by Resight 500 fundus viewing system (Carl Zeiss Meditec). 
Posterior capsulectomy and core vitrectomy was done under irrigation with a 25-gauge cannula placed at the middle trocar on 
the superior side (Fig. 1). Retinal detachment was made by infusing irrigation solution (BSS-Plus Intraocular Irrigating Solution, 
Alcon) into the subretinal space with a 38-gauge polyimide tip (PolyTip Cannula 25G/38G, MedOne Surgical, Inc., Sarasota, FL, 
U.S.A.) attached to a 10-ml syringe for the viscous fluid control (VFC) system at the setting of low intraocular pressure.  
A retinotomy was made by 25-gauge diathermy (Grieshaber Diathermy Probe DSP 25Ga, Alcon) at the edge of retinal detachment. 
After conjunctival incision, a 3 mm-wide scleral incision was placed with a microsurgery knife (Straight/Stab 22.5°, Kai Medical) 
2 mm posteriorly in parallel with the corneal limbus, and wound hemostasis was done with a wet-field hemostatic eraser bipolar 
instrument (Beaver-Visitec International, Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). A rolled-up sheet of the dye-coupled film in 5 × 5 mm 
square size was grasped with a 20-gauge subretinal forceps (Synergetics 39.21S, Bausch+Lomb Retina, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.), 
and inserted into the vitreous and then under the detached retina through a retinotomy. The scleral incision for film insertion 
was sutured with 8–0 Vicryl suture. The subretinal fluid was aspirated with a vitreous cutter, and then fluid in the vitreous was 
exchanged with air to reattach the retina. Laser photocoagulation was applied around the retinal tear caused by retinotomy, and 
silicone oil (polydimethylsiloxane, Silikon 1000, Alcon) was infused into the vitreous by the VFC syringe (Fig. 2). Trocars were 
removed, and the conjunctiva was sutured with 8–0 Vicryl suture.
At surgery to remove dye-coupled films implanted in the subretinal space, three 25-gauge trocars were placed and retinal 
detachment was induced by infusing irrigation fluid into the subretinal space by a 38-gauge tip. A retinotomy was made by 
diathermy and a subretinal dye-coupled film was grasped with a 25-gauge forceps (Grieshaber Revolution DSP 25Ga ILM Forceps, 
Alcon) and brought to the vitreous cavity. The film was brought out of the eye ball with a 25-gauge forceps through a newly made 
3-mm-wide scleral incision 2 mm posterior to the corneal limbus. The scleral incision was sutured. The vitreous cavity was not 
refilled with silicone oil. The films were immersed in distilled water for material analysis. Microscopic surgical view was recorded 
with a digital processor miniature 3CCD color camera (THD-311, Ikegami Tsushinki Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Spectrophotometry
Absorption spectra of dye-coupled films were measured by an ultraviolet and visible light spectrophotometer (V-730, JASCO 
Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The plain films were used to obtain baseline absorption. Absorption was measured in the wavelength ranging 
from 400 to 600 nm at 1 nm spectral bandwidth. The absorption of the 3-month or 5-month implanted dye-coupled films was 
compared with the non-implanted same lot.
Light-evoked surface potential measurement
Light-evoked surface potential on dye-coupled films in the dry condition was measured by the scanning Kelvin Probe system 
(SKP5050, KP Technology, Ltd., Highlands and Islands, U.K.) in the surface photovoltage mode. The dye-coupled film was fixated 
on a sample device. The capacitance between the probe and the sample was changed by oscillating the probe. The surface potential 
of the sample was measured by adjusting the bias to set electrostatic attractive force at zero. The distance between the probe and 
the sample was kept constant by setting the gradient at 200. To confirm the measuring system to be stable, work function at a single 
point on the sample was measured repeatedly 100 times until the standard deviation of work function became 10 or less. Only after 
a waiting time to obtain the stability, the surface potential was measured at changing light intensity with a light source (Surface 
Photovoltage Spectroscopy SPS040, KP Technology).
The slope of surface electric potential changes in response to increase of light intensity as well as the surface electric potential 
at the light intensity of dial setting 2500 (300 lux) were used as the outcome. Surface electric potential measurements on a sample 
were repeated several times to check the repeatability. Surface electric potential values at the light intensity of dial 2500 (300 lux) 
were used for comparison between the 5-month implanted film and the non-implanted same lot.

RESULTS
Surgical feasibility
At the general setting for eye surgery in dogs, it was impossible to expose the conjunctiva around the cornea at the entire 
circumference by placing a lid speculum, as was usually possible in human eyes. Upright positioning of the head with the nose 
brought to the top was mandatory to put the cornea to a horizontal plane in relation with ideal viewing of the wide-field fundus by 
an operating microscope.
At cataract surgery (Fig. 1), anterior capsulectomy was easily accomplished by cutting with a 25G vitreous cutter inserted from 
a limbal side port under continuous irrigation with a 25G infusion cannula also inserted from another limbal side port, as done 
in congenital cataract surgery in human eyes [11]. The lens of dogs at younger ages, as used in this study, was soft enough to be 
aspirated by an irrigation/aspiration (I/A) tip or an ultrasound tip without phacoemulsification. One suture with absorbable 8–0 
Vicryl was required to maintain the anterior chamber against the deformation of the eyeball which was caused in the process of 
trocar insertion.
At vitreous surgery (Figs. 1 and 2), it required greater manual power to insert 25G trocars over the conjunctiva since the sclera 
of dogs was thicker than the human sclera. In addition, three trocars had to be placed at superotemporal one-third circumference 
due to the presence of a large nictitating membrane on the nasal side. With an infusion cannula placed at the middle trocar, 
vitrectomy was done with a light guide inserted at a narrower angle relative to a vitreous cutter. The vitreous cavity was smaller in 
space, compared with human eyes. Bleb retinal detachment could be made only in the lower part of the retina since the upper part 
of the retina with tapetum lucidum was too rigid to make a puncture with an irrigating 38-gauge tip (Fig. 2). Scleral incision, 2 mm 
from the corneal limbus as a route for film insertion, led to bleeding due to more vascularization, compared with the human sclera. 
Scleral hemostasis required extensive coagulation with bipolar diathermy. After the film insertion into the subretinal space, fluid-air 
exchange, laser photocoagulation, and silicone oil injection were done as usual as in human eyes. Removal of implanted films 
could be accomplished with a 25G disposable forceps.
Pathology
Under the silicone oil tamponade, the retina in all 11 dogs had no infiltration with inflammatory cells (Fig. 3). No marked 
proliferative tissues were noted in the vitreous or on the retinal surface. Localized vitreous hemorrhage was found in 3 dogs, and 
rolled-up retinal tissue in localized areas was found in 7 dogs (Table 1). At high magnification, the retina in all dogs maintained 
the ganglion cell layer, inner and outer nuclear layers while it lost the outer segments in some part (Fig. 3). The dye-coupled films 
flowed out from the subretinal space when the non-fixed eye balls were cut to take photographs (Fig. 3).
Absorbance and light-evoked surface potential
All 5 sheets of removed dye-coupled films maintained the dye color. Absorbance could be measured in all 5 implanted samples 
except for one which was implanted for 3 months. The maximum absorbance of 2 sheets of dye-coupled films implanted for 5 
months was 0.287 (77.8% of the same non-implanted lot) and 0.199 (54.1%) while the absorbance of 2 sheets of dye-coupled films 
implanted for 3 months was 0.258 (103.4%) and 0.327 (131.1%).
Light-evoked surface electric potential could be measured only in one film implanted for 5 months. In that 5-month implanted 
film, surface electric potential increased in response to the increase of light intensity (Fig. 4). A similar pattern of increase in 
surface electric potential was observed in the measurement of the non-implanted same lot (Fig. 4). Mean surface electric potential 
with standard deviation of the 5-month implanted film at the light intensity of dial 2500 (300 lux) was 27.12 ± 11.66 mV in repeat 
measurements of 11 times, ranging from 10.77 to 44.00 mV. Mean surface electric potential with standard deviation of the same 
non-implanted lot was 30.43 ± 4.05 mV in repeat measurements of 3 times, ranging from 25.76 to 32.81 mV.
DISCUSSION
The goals of this study are two folds: the first to test surgical feasibility of subretinal film implantation by vitrectomy, and the 
second to test the durability of implanted films. We used normal beagle dogs for this study because dogs have been frequently used 
in other studies for preclinical testing of medical devices such as artificial joints. In addition, there have been reports on cataract 
surgery in dogs [17] as well as vitrectomy to treat retinal detachment in dogs [4, 6, 18, 19] at veterinary clinical settings. An 
experimental study which used dogs for vitrectomy was also described [5].
A major problem in vitrectomy for dogs is the presence of a large vascularized nictitating membrane on the nasal side. 
In addition, many species of animals, including dogs, have a common feature which is not encountered in human eyes: the 
conjunctiva around the cornea cannot be exposed at the entire 360 circumference by placing a lid speculum. The limitation in 
conjunctival exposure naturally results in the narrow surgical field to insert three trocars for vitrectomy instruments. Surgical 
approaches had to be taken in the superotemporal one-third circumference where all three trocars were placed. The 25G trocars 
could be inserted over the conjunctiva straight through the thicker sclera into the vitreous with more magnitude of rotating and 
pushing force, compared with human eyes. Other feature, noted in dog surgery, is the tendency of more bleeding from the scleral 
incision. Bleeding could be managed by intensive bipolar coagulation. Surgical techniques designed in this study to implant dye-
coupled films in canine eyes would help future application of retinal prosthesis as treatment for retinal dystrophies in dogs [16].
As for pathological examination, enucleated eyes were dissected along meridional lines to observe the entire retina before

fixation with formaldehyde. This procedure led to spontaneous flowing-out of subretinal dye-coupled films, together with silicone 
oil in the vitreous. The spontaneous flowing-out of the films indicates no adhesion around the films in the subretinal space. The 
pathological examinations of the dissected eyes revealed neither retinal inflammation nor apparent proliferation. No difference was 
noted in proliferation or inflammation among sham-surgery eyes, film-implanted eyes, and film-removed eyes. Rather higher rates 
of rolled-up retinal tissues in dogs with film removal would be attributed to no refilling of silicone oil in vitreous cavity after the 
film was removed at the second surgery.
We set 5 months as the duration of one choice for long-term implantation and also chose 3 months as the midpoint in the present 
study. The dye-coupled films, implanted for 3 months or 5 months, were basically durable to maintain the color of dye molecules. 
At a closer look, the decrease of the absorbance was indeed noted on 5-month implanted films, compared with 3-month implanted 
films. The absorbance of one piece of the implanted film could not be measured probably due to surface wrinkling caused by 
manipulation with a forceps during the implantation and removal at surgeries. The measurement of absorbance with a new type of 
integrating-sphere spectrophotometry which we now begin to use could lead to better assessment of dye-coupled films.
In the present study, we could measure light-evoked surface electric potential only on one piece of a 5-month implanted film 
among 3 pieces of 3-month implanted films and 2 pieces of 5-month implanted films. A small size of deformed films posed 
difficulty in measuring light-evoked surface potential by the Kelvin probe. We now design a new sample-holder to fixate films 
in a smaller size to measure the surface potential. Another reason for difficulty in the surface potential measurement is that the 
implanted films would have surface contamination with biological substances such as proteins and lipids. In this study, surgically 
removed films were put into pure water and then dried for the measurement. To overcome the instability of surface electric 
potential measurement, we currently put the entire Kelvin probe measuring system in a big box to control humidity. Under the 
circumstances, surface electric potential can be stably measured on any pieces of dye-coupled films.
It should be noted that two sheets of dye-coupled films which had been implanted for 5 months showed decrease in absorbance, 
compared with the non-implanted same lot. On the contrary, one sheet of the 5-month implanted dye-coupled film demonstrated 
almost the same magnitude of surface electric potential increase in response to light intensity as the non-implanted same lot. 
This discrepancy between the absorbance and light-evoked surface electric potential would be explained by the presence of non-
covalently-binding dye molecules on the film surface. These non-covalently-binding dye molecules, which are only attached to 
the film surface by ionic binding, would leave the film surface during the period of implantation. The non-covalently-binding dye

molecules do contribute to the absorbance of the film but do not contribute to light-evoked surface electric potential.
In conclusion, dye-coupled films were implanted successfully in the subretinal space by vitrectomy in dogs. The dye-coupled 
films implanted for 3 or 5 months maintained the dye color, and one piece of the 5-month implanted films showed the increase of 
light-evoked surface electric potential in response to increasing light intensity. Technical refinement, regarding spectrophotometry 
and Kelvin probe measurement, is now in progress to assess the deformed dye-coupled films in a small size which have been 
implanted for a while in the eye and been removed. Overall, this study proved surgical feasibility of subretinal implantation and 
5-month durability of retinal prosthesis, OURePTM. The filing of a first-in-human clinical trial for OURePTM is now negotiated 
at Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) in Japan. In future, OURePTM would be also applicable to treat retinal 
dystrophies in dogs from the viewpoint of veterinary medicine.
