SUMMARY
Current efforts to repair damaged or diseased mammalian retinas are inefficient and largely incapable of fully restoring vision.
Conversely, the zebrafish retina is capable of spontaneous regeneration upon damage using Mu
¨ller glia (MG)-derived progenitors. Under-
standing how zebrafish MG initiate regeneration may help develop new treatments that prompt mammalian retinas to regenerate. We
show that inhibition of g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling facilitates initiation of MG proliferation. GABA levels decrease following
damage, and MG are positioned to detect decreased ambient levels and undergo dedifferentiation. Using pharmacological and genetic
approaches, we demonstrate that GABAA receptor inhibition stimulates regeneration in undamaged retinas while activation inhibits
regeneration in damaged retinas.
INTRODUCTION
Degenerative retinal diseases and damage, such as retinitis
pigmentosa, result in a loss of retinal cells and deterioration
of vision, and can lead to blindness. A current effort to miti-
gate these effects involves intravitreal injections of stem
cells or retinal precursors, hoping for successful integration
and connection to existing neuronal circuits (Barber et al.,
2013; Hanus et al., 2016; MacLaren et al., 2006; Pearson
et
al.,
2012;
Santos-Ferreira
et
al.,
2015).
Though
improving, these therapies are inefficient and not yet
capable of restoring vision (Barber et al., 2013; Bringmann
et al., 2006; Pearson, 2014; Pearson et al., 2010). An alterna-
tive method would be to prompt the retina to endoge-
nously regenerate and replace lost cells.
Mammalian retinas do not possess the ability to re-
generate following disease or damage. Instead, damage
commonly results in reactive gliosis (Bringmann et al.,
2006; Pearson, 2014). Zebrafish, however, mount a robust
spontaneous regeneration response upon damage (Gold-
man, 2014). In this way, Mu
¨ller glia (MG) serve as adult
stem cells in the retina capable of dedifferentiation, asym-
metric division, and the production of progenitor cells
that are capable of restoring all lost cell types (Bernardos
et al., 2007; Fausett and Goldman, 2006; Nagashima et al.,
2013; Rajaram et al., 2014a, 2014b; Ramachandran et al.,
2012; Thummel et al., 2008; Vihtelic and Hyde, 2000; Wan
et al., 2012; Zhao et al., 2014). Because overall retinal archi-
tecture and cell types are largely conserved between fish and
mammals, understanding how zebrafish regulate retina
regeneration may help develop novel treatments or thera-
peutic targets for retinal damage or diseases, especially treat-
ments that target or induce regeneration from MG.
Select regions of the mammalian CNS are capable of
adult neurogenesis, particularly the subgranular zone
(SGZ) of the mouse hippocampus. Recently, the inhibitory
neurotransmitter g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was shown
to play an important role in regulating quiescence of radial
glia-like stem cells (RGLs) in the mouse hippocampus
(Song et al., 2012). Synaptic input from glutamatergic
granule cells regulates activity of parvalbumin-positive
(PV+) GABAergic interneurons in the SGZ. When input
from granule cells is low, decreased extracellular GABA
levels are detected in a non-synaptic, tonic response by
GABAA receptors on RGLs, resulting in proliferation. We
sought to test whether this could be an evolutionarily
conserved mechanism to regulate MG-derived regenera-
tion in the damaged zebrafish retina. In the retina, photo-
receptors (PRs) release glutamate onto GABAergic horizon-
tal cells (HCs). When PRs die they no longer stimulate HCs
to release GABA. We hypothesize that MG detect decreases
in ambient GABA levels and initiate regeneration in a
response similar to activation of RGLs in the mouse hippo-
campus. We show here that disrupting GABA signaling
causes spontaneous proliferation in undamaged zebrafish
retinas and that increasing GABA signaling in damaged
retinas suppresses regeneration.
RESULTS
Inhibition of GABA or Glutamate Receptors Causes
Spontaneous Proliferation in Undamaged Retinas
In the mouse hippocampus, dentate granule cells release
synaptic GABA on PV+ interneurons, and GABA spillover
is detected by neural stem cells to regulate quiescence
versus activation (Chell and Frisen, 2012; Song et al.,
2012). To test whether a similar neuronal network might
be involved in controlling MG quiescence, we tested the
effects of pharmacological inhibition of GABA signaling.
GABAA antagonists were injected into undamaged retinas
to determine whether inhibition of GABA signaling would

 cause spontaneous proliferation (Figure 1). Initially, picro-
toxin or bicuculline were injected into eyes and increased
MG proliferation was observed, but because these inhibi-
tors are not completely GABAA receptor specific we
switched to gabazine, an allosteric inhibitor of the
GABAA receptor (Ueno et al., 1997). As early as 48 hr post
injection (hpi) the number of proliferating cells, as de-
tected by the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA), was significantly greater than both uninjected and
PBS-injected control eyes (Figures 1B–1D and S1A–S1J).
Proliferating cells were detected in the inner nuclear layer
(INL), co-labeled with glutamine synthetase (GS), which
marks MG. This indicates that inhibition of GABA
signaling induced the formation of MG-derived prolifer-
ating cells. Further, proliferating cells were often found in
clusters, indicating a robust regenerative response with
multiple divisions of MG-derived pro genitor cells. Impor-
tantly, the increase in proliferation was not simply the
result of an increase in apoptosis, since TUNEL labeling
showed no increase in cell death following gabazine injec-
tion (Figure S1K). Also, the effects of gabazine injection
were dose dependent, arguing in favor of a specific effect
via the GABAA receptor (Figure S2).
The model of
neural stem cell activation in the
mouse hippocampus hypothesizes that upstream neuronal
activity keeps GABA levels high, maintaining quiescence.
In the retina, the model predicts that inhibiting glutamate
signaling upstream of GABA signaling should produce
effects similar to GABA inhibition (Figure 2). To test this,
we injected the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-
propionic acid (AMPA) receptor antagonist nitro-2,3-diox-
obenzoquinoxaline sulfonamide (NBQX) into undamaged
eyes and measured the proliferation by PCNA staining. Pro-
liferation was significantly greater at 48 hpi, reaching a
maximum at 72 hpi (Figures 2B–2D and S3A–S3J). As
above, clusters of proliferating cells in the INL that co-
labeled with GS were observed at 72 hpi, indicating a robust
regenerative response, and the effects were again dose
dependent and not due to increased apoptosis (Figures
S3K and S4).
Activation of GABA or Glutamate Receptors
Suppresses Regeneration in Damaged Retinas
The previous experiments showed an increase in prolifera-
tion without damage. A converse set of experiments was
devised to determine whether activating GABAA receptors

 or AMPA receptors would suppress regeneration after
damage (Figure 3A). To test this, we ablated rod PRs using
Tg(zop:nfsb-EGFP)nt19
fish
treated
with
metronidazole
(MTZ). Eyes were injected with muscimol, a GABAA re-
ceptor agonist, at 48 hr after MTZ treatment, or AMPA, a
glutamate receptor agonist, at 28 hr after MTZ treatment.
All retinas were collected at 52 hr after MTZ treatment,
when MG proliferation begins (Figure S5). Although the
number of proliferating MG in a region of the retina may
vary, the timing of MG proliferation was relatively uniform
across the retina. Both injections showed a significant
decrease in proliferating cells compared with PBS injec-
tions, as measured by PCNA expression (Figures 3B–3F).
These results are consistent with the overall model that
neural networks control ambient GABA levels that can be
sensed by MG to either maintain quiescence or initiate a
regenerative response.
MG Are Poised to Detect Changes in GABA Levels
If the model that MG quiescence is controlled by GABA
levels is correct, several predictions arise. First, for MG to
detect GABA released from HCs, their processes should be
in close proximity. In mice, the transcription factor Lhx1
is specific to HCs (Liu et al., 2000; Poche et al., 2007). We
tested whether this was true in zebrafish and found that
in Tg(lhx1a:EGFP)pt303 reporter fish, GFP is indeed restricted
to HCs in the retina (Figures 4H and 4I). To test whether
MG and HC processes are closely associated, we immuno-
stained cross-sections of retinas from two lines of zebrafish
that express GFP in either MG (Tg(gfap:GFP)mi2001) or
HCs (Tg(lhx1a:EGFP)pt303) with antibodies against GABA,
glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 (GAD65/67), or GS.
We found that HC and MG processes co-localize in the
INL (Figures 4A–4I). Although overall monitoring of
GABA levels in the retina is likely due to contacts between
MG and multiple cells across the three main layers of the
retina, this result is intriguing in that there appears to be
a specialized connection between MG and HCs in the fish
retina. To more closely determine the nature of this interac-
tion, we stained flat-mounted Tg(lhx1a:EGFP)pt303 retinas
with GS, which showed that MG processes wrap around
HC processes in the INL (Figures S6A–S6E).
Second, when we immunostained for the presence of
GABAA receptors we detected the g2 subunit of the

 GABAA receptor (GABRG2) on MG processes that flank HC
processes (Figures 4J–4M). This was validated by detection
of mRNAs encoding GABRG2 by RT-PCR of RNA isolated
from sorted MG, consistent with previous work (Rama-
chandran et al., 2012, and data not shown). In the mouse,
GABRG2 has been shown to be essential for neurogenesis
in the SGZ (Song et al., 2012). Identifying GABRG2 expres-
sion and localization in MG suggests that a similar role
could be played by fish MG.
A third prediction is that following injury when a regen-
erative response is initiated, retinal GABA levels should
decrease. To determine this, we monitored GABA levels in
whole retina by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) after rod ablation in Tg(zop:nfsb-EGFP)nt19 fish
treated with MTZ. We observed a significant decrease in
whole-retina GABA levels at 52 hpi (Figure S6F).
MG Directly Detect Changes in GABA Levels
Together, the aforementioned data support the idea that
MG are poised to detect decreased GABA levels following
damage, but it remained uncertain whether the effects
were mediated directly by MG. The different agonists and
antagonists could be acting indirectly to cause MG prolifer-
ation, since many other cells contain GABAA or glutamate
receptors and many cells also release GABA or glutamate.
As a first step to address this, we used a genetic approach
by creating a construct expressing a dominant-negative
version of the zebrafish g2 subunit of the GABAA receptor
(DNg2), following an identical human mutation that un-
derlies an inherited form of epilepsy (Harkin et al., 2002;
Kang et al., 2009). The zebrafish glial fibrillary acidic
protein (GFAP) promoter was used to drive expression
of an mCherry-tagged version of the DNg2 isoform in
MG. Injection and electroporation of this construct into
Tg(gfap:GFP)mi2001 fish was performed followed by analysis
of proliferating cells that co-localize with mCherry, GFP,
and PCNA. Successful electroporation and expression of
the construct is expected to be a rare event, especially
because the DNg2 mutation is caused by a premature
stop codon which will result in nonsense-mediated decay,
making visualization of mCherry potentially difficult.
Nevertheless, detecting even rare cells exhibiting co-locali-
zation of the three markers would strongly argue in favor of
a direct response by MG. As shown in Figure 5, we observed
a significant increase in the total number of proliferating
cells, marked by PCNA and co-localizing with GFP and
mCherry (Figures 5 and S7). Some of the proliferating cells
observed in Figures 5 and S7 are in the outer nuclear layer

 and are likely rod precursors, while those in the GCL are
likely microglia. Proliferation of these cells is probably
due to limited damage that occurs during electroporation,
but the increased proliferation in MG with DNg2 is most
consistent with inhibition of GABA signaling.
Inhibition of GABA Signaling Induces a Bona Fide
Regenerative Response
Besides caveats as to whether inhibition of GABA signaling
is mediated directly by MG, another potential caveat is
whether the observed increase in proliferation is part of
a bona fide regenerative response. To test whether pro-
liferation resulting from gabazine or NBQX injections
accurately replicates regeneration, we analyzed markers of
regeneration following injections. Drugs were injected
into Tg(tuba1a:GFP) and Tg(her4:dRFP) fish, marking activa-
tion of a-tubulin 1a and Notch signaling, respectively. Both
genes have been shown to be upregulated during regenera-
tion (Fausett and Goldman, 2006; Hayes et al., 2007; Ram-
achandran et al., 2012; Wan et al., 2012). After injection,
both were found to be upregulated and associated with
PCNA-expressing cells (Figure 6), suggesting that drug-
induced proliferation is accurately replicating what is
observed during damage-induced retinal regeneration.
To further test whether a bona fide regenerative response
was initiated, we combined gabazine treatment with
knockdown of Ascl1. Ascl1 is a transcription factor that is
necessary for MG dedifferentiation and retina regeneration
in both fish and mice (Brzezinski et al., 2011; Fausett et al.,
2008; Pollak et al., 2013; Ramachandran et al., 2010, 2011;
Ueki et al., 2015; Wohl and Reh, 2016). Dedifferentiated
MG express a1-tubulin (as used in the Tg(tuba1a:GFP)
fish) whose expression is due in part to binding of Ascl1
to an E box within the promoter (Fausett et al., 2008). If
gabazine treatment is inducing a bona fide regenerative
response via MG, the prediction is that proliferation should
be inhibited by knockdown of Ascl1. As shown in Figure 7,
we observed a significant decrease in the number of prolif-
erating cells and clusters of proliferating cells when anti-
sense morpholinos targeting Ascl1 were co-injected with

 gabazine or NBQX compared with gabazine or NBQX
injection alone or with co-injection of a standard control
morpholino. These results indicate that inhibition of
GABA signaling induces a bona fide regenerative response.
While the majority of these experiments used expression
of PCNA as a readout of DNA replication and proliferation,
the results support the idea that detection of PCNA is truly
indicative of a regenerative response, since expression of
a1-tubulin is observed in dedifferentiated MG and prolifer-
ating progenitor cells.
DISCUSSION
Our data support a mechanism whereby decreased ambient
GABA levels are sensed by MG to initiate retina regenera-
tion. Due to their expression of GABAA receptors, MG are
poised to detect this decrease. While other cells may also
play a role, we hypothesize that HCs are positioned to
mediate the decrease in GABA following PR death due to
close association between HCs and MG in a specialized
layer of the INL. In the retina, MG contact all cells and,
therefore, a potential interaction between HC and MG is
not surprising. However, this interaction may be unique
to zebrafish and within a layer of the retina not found in
mammals. This interaction, therefore, may provide the ze-
brafish retina with one of its unique qualities: its ability to
regenerate. In the mouse brain, GABA is involved in neuro-
genesis in the SGZ and subventricular zone (Bordey, 2007;
Liu et al., 2005; Pallotto and Deprez, 2014; Song et al.,
2012). Multiple reports have also indicated a role for
GABA in controlling proliferation of progenitor cells
(Braun and Jessberger, 2014; Giachino et al., 2014; Liu
et al., 2005; Pallotto and Deprez, 2014; Ramirez et al.,
2012; Song et al., 2013; Tozuka et al., 2005). Our results sug-
gest that this also holds for the retina.
Our data suggest that PR damage is communicated via
GABA, based on the timing of events in different experi-
ments. Nevertheless, the possibility exists that MG directly
sense changes in glutamate as well. Maximum proliferation
for gabazine injections was observed at 48 hpi while
maximum proliferation for NBQX injections was observed
at 72 hpi. This suggests that GABA affects MG more proxi-
mally than glutamate. Furthermore, muscimol injection
into damaged retinas only produced an effect when in-
jected at 48 hr after MTZ treatment, while AMPA injections
only produced an effect when injected at 28 hr after MTZ
treatment. Injecting muscimol earlier or AMPA at later

 times did not cause significant changes in proliferation.
The overall timing best supports the idea that GABA acts
directly on MG and glutamate is upstream.
Previous studies have suggested that tumor necrosis fac-
tor a (TNF-a) (Nelson et al., 2013), Notch (Conner et al.,
2014), leptin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Zhao et al., 2014),
are involved in initiating retina regeneration in zebrafish.
It is possible that these and other, as yet undiscovered, sig-
nals act synergistically to mount a full, robust regenerative
response. However, even though TNF-a, Notch, leptin, and
IL-6 are all relatively early markers of regeneration, it is not
clear what signals induce their expression, especially
because numerous gene expression changes accompany
differential expression of these factors. An attractive hy-
pothesis based on our data is that decreased GABA is the
primary signal for retinal regeneration initiation and that
other signals follow to act synergistically. This is supported
by the fact that injection of gabazine or NBQX causes an
upregulation of the Notch reporter Her4, suggesting that
GABA is upstream of Notch signaling. This is also in line
with earlier studies showing that Notch signaling is impor-
tant for later stages of regeneration and development
(Hayes et al., 2007; Karl et al., 2008; Kassen et al., 2007;
Olena et al., 2015; Raymond et al., 2006). In addition, lep-
tin mRNA was observed to increase following injury,
suggesting that it is induced by some other signal. Interest-
ingly, IL-6 mRNA was not detected in regenerating retinas,
indicating that its source originates from outside the retina
and may be prompted to increase only after damage occurs
(Zhao et al., 2014). Inflammatory signals such as TNF-a and
IL-6 may be released by endogenous immune cells (e.g.,
microglia [Fischer et al., 2014]) or those invading from
the vasculature after damage.
Retinitis pigmentosa and age-related macular degenera-
tion arise from dysfunction and death of PRs. We have
focused on PR regeneration but questions remain as to
how bipolar, amacrine, or ganglion cells regenerate. It
may be that feedback mechanisms are in place whereby
HC activity would be affected by the death of other cells.
For example, dopaminergic amacrine cells have been
found to have processes that project to the HC layer and
may also affect HC activity (Herrmann et al., 2011). There
are likely other mechanisms by which the retina senses bi-
polar, amacrine, or ganglion cell death as well. MG pro-
cesses appear to surround the cell bodies of amacrine and
ganglion cells, suggesting a different mechanism to sense

 cell death, such as juxtacrine or paracrine signaling. These
mechanisms may also be involved in the sensation of PR
and HC death. Identifying a method to induce sponta-
neous MG proliferation and the production of progenitor
cells may be sufficient if the new progenitors can then
follow endogenous cues to differentiate into whichever
cell is needed. New therapies that activate MG in this
manner could lead to robust endogenous regeneration
and counteract many retinal diseases. These might include
both
agonists
and
antagonists
of
neurotransmitter
signaling, but could also be targeted at intracellular cas-
cades downstream of GABA signaling (Andang et al.,
2008; Fernando et al., 2011; Jagasia et al., 2009; Quadrato
et al., 2012, 2014; Ramirez et al., 2012).
Lastly, the question remains of why teleost retinas have
maintained a robust regenerative response while mamma-
lian retinas are largely incapable of repair. The cellular
organization found in zebrafish may be a key difference.
In zebrafish, the HCs form a monolayer that is separated
from the rest of the INL by the network of HC and MG pro-
cesses, observed in the current study. A consequence of this
organization is that the HCs contain processes that project
into the INL as well as into the outer plexiform layer (OPL).
In mice, however, the HCs are co-mingled with other
cells in the INL and only contain projections into the
OPL (Matsuoka et al., 2012; Poche et al., 2007). Investi-
gating HC development and potential interactions be-
tween HCs and MG could greatly inform about how MG
respond to damage in the mammalian retina. It may be
that MG are inefficient or blocked from detecting changes
in GABA after damage, but perhaps alteration of signaling
by pharmacological agents such as gabazine could push
MG down a regenerative path.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Zebrafish Lines and Maintenance
Animals used in this study were treated in accordance with Vander-
bilt’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Zebrafish
lines used in this study include Tg(gfap:GFP)mi2001 (Raymond
et al., 2006), which marks differentiated MG, Tg(zop:nfsb-EGFP)nt19
(Montgomery et al., 2010), which marks rods and is used for rod
ablation, Tg(lhx1a:EGFP)pt303 (Swanhart et al., 2010), which marks
HCs, Tg(tuba1a:GFP) (Fausett and Goldman, 2006), which marks
dedifferentiated MG and progenitor cells, and Tg(her4:dRFP) (Yeo
et al., 2007), which marks Notch-activated cells. All fish were main-
tained in a 14:10-hr light/dark (L/D) cycle at 28�C unless otherwise
noted. All animals were between 3 and 7 months old.

covery. The extent of regeneration was assayed at the indicated
times post recovery after MTZ treatment.
HPLC Analysis of GABA
Whole retinas were dissected from Tg(zop:nfsb-EGFP)nt19 trans-
genic zebrafish following recovery from MTZ treatment. Protein
was extracted from ten whole retinas for each time point and sub-
jected to HPLC. The levels of each amino acid and derivations were
quantified.
Drug and Morpholino Injections
Different neurotoxins were injected into the vitreous using a pro-
tocol adapted from previous studies (Rajaram et al., 2014a,
2014b; Thummel et al., 2008). The drugs included gabazine (Sigma
S106), NBQX (Abcam ab210046), muscimol (Sigma M1523), and
AMPA (Sigma A9111). In brief, zebrafish were anesthetized in
0.016% tricaine, an incision was made in the sclera with a sapphire
knife, and a blunt-end 30-gauge needle inserted. Drugs (0.5 mL)
were injected into one eye of adult zebrafish. Fish were immedi-
ately placed into a recovery tank; times indicated are hours of
recovery.
Morpholino Injections
Standard control morpholino or ascl1a morpholinos were injected
as described above. 0.5 mL of 30-lissamine-tagged morpholinos
(Gene Tools) at a concentration of 1.5 mM were injected with or
without neurotoxins into one eye of adult zebrafish and electropo-
rated (75 V/pulse, two pulses, 1-s intervals between pulses). Fish
were given 72 hr following injection to allow for recovery and pro-
liferation before eyes were removed for immunohistochemistry
and scoring. Morpholinos used were ascl1a MO1 (50-ATC TTG
GCG GTG ATG TCC ATT TCG C-30), ascl1a MO2 (50-AAG GAG
TGA GTC AAA GCA CTA AAG T-30) (Cau and Wilson, 2003), and
a standard control morpholino (50-CCT CTT ACC TCA GTT ACA
ATT TAT A-30).
Immunohistochemistry and TUNEL Labeling
Zebrafish were euthanized in 0.08% tricaine and whole eyes were
removed and fixed in 9:1 ethanolic formaldehyde (PCNA staining)
or 4% paraformaldehyde (all other staining) overnight. Eyes were
then washed in PBS and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose for 4 hr at
room temperature. Eyes were transferred to a solution containing
two parts optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT) and
one part 30% sucrose overnight followed by transfer to 100%
OCT for 2 hr and then embedded in OCT for cryosectioning.
Antibodies used were PCNA (Sigma, P8825; Abcam, ab2426), GS
(Millipore, mab302), GABA (Sigma, A0310), GABAA receptor g2
subunit (Novus Biologicals, NB300-151), GAD65 + GAD67 (Ab-
cam, ab11070), GFP (Torrey Pines BioLabs, TP401), and mCherry
(Novus Biologicals, NBP1-96752). TUNEL labeling was performed
following immunohistochemistry. The in situ cell death detection
kit, TMR Red (Roche Applied Sciences, 12156792910) was used to
detect apoptotic cells.
Design of Dominant-Negative g2 and Electroporation
A dominant-negative form of the g2 subunit of the GABAAR was
previously characterized in humans (Harkin et al., 2002; Kang
et al., 2009). The mutation is in a conserved position in zebrafish
and generates a premature codon. A plasmid containing the zebra-
fish mRNA sequence of g2 until the premature stop codon was
created by GeneArt. The sequence was cloned into a Tol2 backbone
to create the vector GFAP:mCh(no-stop)-DNg2. A control vector
GFAP:mCh(no-stop)-pA was also created. Both constructs were
electroporated into retinas following a protocol adapted from pre-
vious studies (Rajaram et al., 2014a, 2014b; Thummel et al., 2008).
In brief, fish were anesthetized, the outer cornea was removed, an
incision was made in the sclera with a sapphire knife, and a blunt-
end 30-gauge needle was inserted into the vitreous. 0.5 mL of
plasmid DNA at a concentration of 2 ng/mL was injected into the
vitreous of one eye. Anesthetized fish were allowed to recover
and then re-anesthetized, and injected eyes were electroporated
(50 V/pulse, four pulses, 1-s intervals between pulses). Treated
fish were placed in recovery tanks for the times indicated.
Statistical Analysis
Two-tailed Student’s t test was performed when comparing two
means and a one-way ANOVA when comparing three or more
means. The tests used are indicated in each figure, as well as the
number of eyes measured. In most cases, experiments were per-
formed using a single clutch of fish that were divided among
different treatment groups. When multiple clutches were required
the fish were mixed, then distributed among treatment groups to
reduce bias. One to four sections from one eye were measured
and the resulting values averaged to arrive at the reported values.
Eyes that were damaged were not included in analysis, based on
disrupted morphology and/or extremely high proliferation.
