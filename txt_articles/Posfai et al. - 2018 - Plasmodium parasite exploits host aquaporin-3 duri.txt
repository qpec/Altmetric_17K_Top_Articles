Abstract
Within the liver a single Plasmodium parasite transforms into thousands of blood-infective
forms to cause malaria. Here, we use RNA-sequencing to identify host genes that are upre-
gulated upon Plasmodium berghei infection of hepatocytes with the hypothesis that host
pathways are hijacked to benefit parasite development. We found that expression of aqua-
porin-3 (AQP3), a water and glycerol channel, is significantly induced in Plasmodium-
infected hepatocytes compared to uninfected cells. This aquaglyceroporin localizes to the
parasitophorous vacuole membrane, the compartmental interface between the host and
pathogen, with a temporal pattern that correlates with the parasite’s expansion in the liver.
Depletion or elimination of host AQP3 expression significantly reduces P. berghei parasite
burden during the liver stage and chemical disruption by a known AQP3 inhibitor, auphen,
reduces P. falciparum asexual blood stage and P. berghei liver stage parasite load. Further
use of this inhibitor as a chemical probe suggests that AQP3-mediated nutrient transport is
an important function for parasite development. This study reveals a previously unknown
potential route for host-dependent nutrient acquisition by Plasmodium which was discov-
ered by mapping the transcriptional changes that occur in hepatocytes throughout P. ber-
ghei infection. The dataset reported may be leveraged to identify additional host factors that
are essential for Plasmodium liver stage infection and highlights Plasmodium’s dependence
on host factors within hepatocytes.
Author summary
Plasmodium parasites undergo an obligatory morphogenesis and replication within the
liver before they invade red blood cells and cause malaria. The liver stage is clinically silent
but essential for the Plasmodium parasite to complete its life cycle. During this time, the par-
asite relies on the host cell to support a massive replication event, yet host factors that are
critical to this expansion are largely unknown. We identify human aquaporin-3 (AQP3), a

Introduction
Malaria remains one of the greatest burdens to global health with an estimated 440,000 deaths
in 2015 [1]. While fatalities attributed to malaria have significantly declined over the past
decade as a result of increased interventions, the spread of resistance to current antimalarial
treatments and insecticides threatens the progress that has been made in eliminating this infec-
tious disease. The causative agent of malaria is the Plasmodium parasite, an obligate intracellu-
lar pathogen that strategically exploits host processes to ensure its survival. Many of these
interactions between the host and parasite remain unknown, particularly during the parasite’s
elusive liver stage.
The Plasmodium parasite is transferred to the human host via the bite of an Anopheles mos-
quito in the form of a sporozoite. Before the Plasmodium parasite can invade erythrocytes and
cause disease, it must first pass through an obligatory liver stage. Sporozoites travel through
the bloodstream to the liver where they pass through multiple hepatocytes before establishing
an infection in a final cell [2–5]. As the sporozoite invades the hepatocyte, invagination of the
host cell membrane forms the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) around the parasite,
protecting it from clearance [6, 7]. It is within this PV that the sporozoite undergoes dramatic
morphological changes to become the exo-erythrocytic form (EEF) [8], which subsequently
divides into tens of thousands of merozoites within a single hepatocyte [9]. After maturation,
the blood infective merozoites are released into the blood stream where they cause the symp-
toms of malaria.
The liver stage of the Plasmodium life cycle is an attractive target for drug and vaccine devel-
opment as it represents a bottleneck in the parasite population. Furthermore, inhibition of
liver-stage parasites prevents disease manifestation that emerges in the subsequent blood stage.
During this stage, the parasite relies on host cell factors for successful invasion, development,
and nutrient acquisition to support its massive replication [10]. However, few host proteins
that are involved in the maturation of these parasites have been identified. The host CD81
receptor [11], scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI) [12, 13], and the surface protein EphA2
[14] have all been identified as important invasion factors, but among these only SR-BI has
been implicated in the maturation of parasites after invasion. Few other host proteins are
known to be critical for the developing parasites. Thus, while significant advances have been
made to our current understanding of hepatocyte invasion, host-pathogen interactions that
are beneficial for the parasite’s development within the hepatocyte remain poorly understood.
Host-based strategies represent an attractive, yet underexplored route to malaria control as
they reduce the probability that parasites will develop drug resistance when compared to para-
site-directed therapeutics [15]. However, a greater understanding of host-parasite interactions
during the liver stage is critical to develop these measures.
A comprehensive analysis of the host response to infection during the liver stage has been
challenging because of the low infection rate of hepatocytes by sporozoites [16] and the techni-
cal difficulty of obtaining sporozoites in large quantities from the salivary glands of live mos-
quitoes. Previous work aiming to elucidate important hepatocyte factors assessed the host

 transcriptome in response to P. berghei infection by microarray analysis. Researchers found an
initial host response to stress followed by maintenance of cell viability in response to infection
[17]. This important work provided a global analysis of the host response to Plasmodium infec-
tion, but it remains unclear whether any of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are regu-
lated in a manner that is advantageous to the parasite. In addition to the previously reported
sequential regulation of genes in hepatocytes, we hypothesized that conserved host-parasite
interactions during the liver stage have evolved that are essential for the proper maturation
and development of EEFs. To search for essential host factors, we used RNA-sequencing
(RNA-seq) to identify genes that are induced in HepG2 hepatocytes upon P. berghei infection.
Among genes that were differentially expressed, aquaporin-3 (AQP3) was chosen for func-
tional analysis because it was one of the most highly induced genes upon infection and because
of previous literature related to aquaporins and parasite development.
Aquaporins (AQPs) are a family of highly conserved membrane proteins that transport
water and other small solutes [18]. There are 13 human AQP isoforms that belong to one of
two groups: orthodox aquaporins that strictly transport water and aquaglyceroporins that are
capable of transporting small solutes, such as glycerol, in addition to water molecules across
membranes [19, 20]. The role of the aquaporin family of proteins has been previously studied
in the context of Plasmodium infections, but primarily focusing of the parasite aquaglycero-
porin [21]. The P. falciparum aquaporin, PfAQP, localizes to the parasite cell membrane where
it is thought to be critical for glycerol transport. The role of host aquaporins during Plasmo-
dium infection is understood to a lesser extent, but have been implicated in blood stage infec-
tions [21] where one report demonstrated that AQP3 localizes to the parasitophorous vacuole
of P. falciparum infected red blood cells [22].
AQP3 is an aquaglyceroporin that transports both water and glycerol in mammalian cells
[20, 23]. We found that AQP3 expression was induced in human hepatocytes in response to P.
berghei infection at times that implicated a role in the rapid expansion and replication of the
parasite. Our subsequent molecular studies revealed that this host protein is actively trafficked
to the PVM after invasion. Genetic disruption or depletion of AQP3 leads to a significant
decrease in P. berghei liver stage parasite load. Furthermore, treatment with auphen, a known
AQP3 inhibitor, reduces both P. berghei parasite load in hepatocytes and P. falciparum parasite
load in erythrocytes, suggesting the host protein has an essential role during various parasite
life stages. Importantly, deletion of AQP3 in mice is not lethal [24], suggesting the host protein
has potential as a possible therapeutic target. This work enhances our current understanding
of host liver processes influenced by Plasmodium infection and highlights the potential of tar-
geting these processes for future drug and vaccine development against malaria. Further, the
provided datasets of DEGs during Plasmodium infection can serve as the foundation for future
studies aimed at understanding the host response.
Results
Screening of host gene expression implicates AQP3 in Plasmodium
infection
To evaluate potential host responses to Plasmodium infection, we performed RNA-seq on
HepG2 human hepatocytes infected with GFP-expressing P. berghei. Because of the inherently
low infection rate of sporozoites in the best in vitro model systems [16], we isolated infected
cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (S1 Fig). Approximately 3,000 Plasmodium
infected-cells were sorted at 4, 24, and 48 hpi as well as uninfected cells in 2–4 biological repli-
cates. RNA isolation and library preparation followed by sequencing was achieved using a pro-
tocol designed for low cell numbers. From an evaluation of each candidate gene, AQP3 was

 chosen for functional studies because it was one of the most significantly induced genes and
evidence from previous studies that aquaporins are involved in Plasmodium infection [21, 22].
Host AQP3 is upregulated and incorporated into the parasitophorous
vacuole membrane in response to infection
RNA-seq analysis shows that AQP3 is one of the most differentially expressed genes in HepG2
cells infected with P. berghei. Human AQP3, which is widely expressed in the kidney, skin, and
erythrocytes [25–27], can transport both water and glycerol. The human genome encodes thir-
teen AQP isoforms, and based on literature, AQP3, AQP6, AQP7, AQP8, AQP9, and AQP11
mRNAs are expressed in uninfected HepG2 cells [28]. Upon infection, AQP3 expression is
induced and it is the only aquaporin isoform to be significantly (p = 1.55 x 10−7) differentially
expressed (Fig 1A). We further confirmed the induction of AQP3 expression in P. berghei-
infected hepatocytes by qRT-PCR of RNA extracted from both HepG2 and HuH7 infected cells
(Fig 1B). At 48 hpi, HepG2 cells exhibited a 15-fold increase in AQP3 mRNA expression
(p = 0.001, two-tailed Student’s t-test; n = 3 independent experiments) and HuH7 cells, an alter-
nate human hepatoma cell line, had a 4-fold increase in AQP3 expression compared to unin-
fected HuH7 cells (p = 0.0075, two-tailed Student’s t-test; n = 4 independent experiments).
AQP3 is a membrane protein that generally localizes to the plasma membrane in human
cells where it facilitates the transport of water and glycerol [18]. However, upon hepatocyte
infection by Plasmodium a second membrane is present, the PVM, which is derived from the
host cell plasma membrane when the parasite first penetrates the hepatocyte. Because Plasmo-
dium infection leads to the upregulation of AQP3 gene expression, we hypothesized that the
protein localizes to the PVM of Plasmodium-infected hepatocytes. Evidence of human AQP3
localization to the PVM in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes also supported this hypothesis
[22]. To test if AQP3 localizes to the PVM during the liver stage, we used immunofluorescent
(IF) microscopy with antibodies targeting human AQP3 and monitored the intracellular local-
ization of the protein throughout infection. Visualization of AQP3 in P. berghei-infected hepa-
tocytes demonstrated that the protein localizes to the PVM in both HepG2 and HuH7 cells
(Fig 2, S1 Movie). We utilized confocal microscopy to show colocalization of AQP3 with UIS4,
a parasite protein that is known to be integrated into the PVM [29], in HepG2 cells (Fig 2A). A

 Pearson colocalization coefficient of 0.56 ± 0.014 (mean ± SD) was calculated from z-stacked
images of three individual cells with staining for AQP3 and UIS4. We also show that AQP3
localizes to the PVM of P. berghei infected HuH7 cells as early as 28 hpi, after the parasite initi-
ates nuclear division (Fig 2B). Some infected cells showed partial localization of AQP3 to the
host cell membrane at 28 hpi, but localization thereafter is restricted to the PVM. In this in
vitro infection model system protein quantification by Western blot analysis is difficult due to
the limited number of Plasmodium-infected cells that can be feasibly collected; however, anti-
body staining shows that protein levels are elevated in P. berghei infected hepatocytes when
compared to uninfected cells (S2 Fig). Taken together, this analysis indicates that human
AQP3 protein levels in hepatocytes increase in response to P. berghei infection, in agreement
with the observed increase in gene transcription, and that AQP3 is actively trafficked to the
PVM rather than being incorporated from the host cell membrane during parasite penetration
of the host cell.
Host AQP3 is essential for parasite development
To address whether host AQP3 expression in P. berghei infected cells is necessary for the para-
sites to undergo morphological changes and replication within the PV, AQP3 mRNA was
depleted by RNA interference (RNAi) and mutant AQP3 cell lines were generated. First,
AQP3 mRNA expression was depleted by pooling two small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) tar-
geting AQP3 (Qiagen). Scavenger receptor type B class I (SR-BI) siRNA depletion was used as
a positive control as it is one of the few host genes that is known to be important for parasite
development [12]. Efficiency of siRNA knockdowns was evaluated by extracting RNA from
cells 48 hours after siRNA transfection and measuring mRNA expression of targeted genes by
qRT-PCR. In parallel experiments, the impact of gene silencing on parasite load and cell viabil-
ity was assessed in hepatocytes 48 hours after P. berghei infection. Parasite load after infection
was quantified using a luciferase reporter constitutively expressed in P. berghei parasites [30].
Upon AQP3 siRNA reverse transfection of HuH7 cells, a 90% reduction in AQP3 transcripts
resulted in a 60% reduction in parasite load (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Student’s t-test; n = 3 inde-
pendent experiments) (Fig 3A and 3B). Reverse transfection of hepatocytes did not lead to any
changes in cell viability 48 hpi (S3A Fig). The depletion of SR-BI transcripts by 86% led to a
68% reduction in parasite load (p < 0.0001, two-tailed Student’s t-test; n = 3 independent
experiments), similar to what was observed in AQP3 depleted cells.
To further assess the impact of aquaporins on liver stage Plasmodium parasite development,
all human aquaporin isoforms present in hepatocytes [28] were targeted by RNAi. Each gene
was targeted by four individual siRNAs (S1 Table). Efficiency of siRNA knockdowns, parasite
load, and cell viability were assessed (S2 Table, S3B and S3C Fig) and Fig 3 shows representa-
tive data that include the two siRNAs for each gene that correspond to the greatest mRNA
transcript depletion. The only aquaporin genes with a significant decrease in expression and
simultaneous reduction in parasite load, with a minimum of two separate siRNAs, were
AQP3, AQP7 and AQP9, all of which are aquaglyceroporins. AQP3 mRNA depletion had the
greatest influence on parasite load with an average of 69% reduction (Fig 3C). AQP7 and
AQP9 depletion also significantly reduced parasite load, resulting in a 65% and 63% reduction
on average, respectively (Fig 3C). One siRNA targeting the orthodox aquaporin, AQP11
(AQP11-1 in Fig 3C), reduced parasite load by 52% (p = 0.0343, One-way ANOVA, Dunnnet’s
multiple comparison test). However, all four siRNAs reduced AQP11 transcripts (>85%) with
only AQP11-1 significantly altering parasite load, suggesting its activity is due to off-target
effects. Importantly, liver cell viability was not altered upon siRNA transfection of the selected

 aquaglyceroporins, indicating that parasite load reduction was not a byproduct of hepatocyte
toxicity (p > 0.5, One-way ANOVA, Dunnett’s multiple comparison test; n = 3).
To validate the role of AQP3 on parasite load by an alternate means, the AQP3 gene was
genetically mutated in HuH7 cells using CRISPR/Cas9 [31]. Multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs)
were used for the generation of AQP3 mutant cell lines, targeting either exon 1 or 2 of the
AQP3 gene (S3 Table). After single cell sorting, PCR amplification of the AQP3 gene in clonal

expression of cells that were targeted by pooled AQP3 or SR-BI siRNAs at 50 nM. Reverse transfection of HuH7 cells
by two siRNAs targeting AQP3 led to a 90% decrease in AQP3 mRNA transcripts (p = 0.005, unpaired Student’s t-test;
n = 3 independent experiments), similar to the 86% efficiency in depletion of SR-BI, the positive control (p = 0.0186,

 populations was used to screen for mutations in the genomic DNA of the cells, resulting in
four AQP3 mutant cell lines (AQP3mut1-4). All four AQP3mut cell lines had confirmed muta-
tions in the AQP3 gene and reduced P. berghei parasite load by approximately 80% compared
to wild type HuH7 cells at 48 hpi (S4A Fig). Fig 4 shows the data for two of these AQP3mut cell
lines. Two gRNAs targeting exon 2 of the gene were used to generate AQP3mut1 and resulted
in a 39 bp deletion (S4B and S4C Fig). Because the mutation did not result in a frame-shift,
mRNA was still transcribed, however, protein was not detected by IF staining (Fig 4B), likely
because of the inability of the protein to fold properly. Protein structure modeling of AQP3mut1
(SWISS-MODEL) suggests that the 39 bp deletion results in a nonfunctional channel that can-
not transport nutrients (S4D Fig). Separately, AQP3mut2 was generated with two gRNAs tar-
geting exon 1 of AQP3. mRNA transcripts and protein expression were not detected in this
mutant cell line (Fig 4A and 4B). AQP3mut1 and AQP3mut2 cells had significantly lower parasite
load 48 hours after P. berghei infection, with 77 and 82% reduction in parasite load, respec-
tively, compared to wild type HuH7 cells (p < 0.001, One-way ANOVA, Dunnet’s multiple

 significantly decreased parasite load in the mutant hepatocytes, it did not influence hepatocyte
viability or cell growth (S4E Fig).
The EEFs after genetic disruption of AQP3 in liver cells were analyzed by microscopy for
possible defects in development. EEF size calculations were compeleted by widefield fluores-
cent microscopy of HuH7 infected cells. The size of the EEFs in wild type HuH7 cells and
AQP3mut1 cells were measured at 24, 36, and 48 hpi. Significant changes in size were not
detected at 24 hpi with both cell lines having roughly 40 μm2 EEFs on average (Fig 4D)
(p = 0.81, unpaired Student’s t-test; n > 70). However, by 36 hpi EEFs in wild type HuH7 cells
were 2.9x larger than in AQP3mut1 cells, with EEFs averaging 112 and 40 μm2, respectively
(p < 0.0001, unpaired Student’s t-test; n > 85). At 48 hpi EEFs in wild type HuH7 cells were
123 μm2 while EEFs in AQP3mut1 were 48 μm2 (p < 0.0001, unpaired Student’s t-test;
n > 100). Interestingly, EEFs in AQP3mut1 cells had no significant increase in size between 24
and 36 hpi and only had an 18% increase in size between 24 and 48 hpi. For comparison, EEFs
in wild type HuH7 had a 218% increase in size between 24 and 48 hpi. Thus, parasite growth is
stunted during the late liver stage development of P. berghei. While the size of EEFs was signifi-
cantly reduced in AQP3mut1 cells, the infection rate, measured by EEFs/well, was not altered
(p = 0.165, two-tailed Student’s t-test) (Fig 4E). Three independent experiments were per-
formed and representative data is shown from a single experiment. Significant changes were
not observed in any experiments.
AQP3 inhibitor auphen hinders parasite development at multiple stages of
Plasmodium life cycle
To probe if AQP3 is necessary for water permeability or glycerol transport we employed the
gold-based compound [AuCl2(phen)]Cl (auphen) (Fig 5A) that selectively and irreversibly
inhibits glycerol transport [32], but only minimally affects water permeability of AQP3 at con-
centrations above 100 μM [32, 33]. This functional selectivity is thought to be due to the inter-
action of Au(III) with a conserved cysteine residue at the selectivity filter of AQP3 that is not
present in orthodox aquaporins [33]. Auphen was synthesized (S5 Fig) and found to inhibit
liver stage parasite load with an EC50 = 0.77 ± 0.08 μM (mean ± SEM; n = 3 independent
experiments) (Fig 5B), when P. berghei infected HuH7 hepatocytes were treated at 0 hpi.
Because of the abundance of AQP3 in erythrocytes [27], we also tested auphen inhibition of P.
falciparum Dd2-infected erythrocytes. Auphen treatment resulted in inhibition of P. falcipa-
rum with an EC50 of 0.81 ± 0.10 μM (mean ± SEM; n = 2) (Fig 5C), indicating that auphen is
an effective inhibitor of multiple species and stages of the Plasmodium life cycle.
We hypothesized that auphen inhibits parasite load during the liver stage by inhibiting the
glycerol permeability of AQP3. Most parasite functions that require glycerol, such as mem-
brane and organelle synthesis, occur after 24 hpi, so we compared auphen potency with treat-
ment at 0 and 24 hpi. Auphen treatment at 24 hpi yielded nearly identical EC50 values in both
HepG2 and HuH7 cells when compared to cells treated at 0 hpi (Figs 5B and S6A). Impor-
tantly, hepatocyte cell viability was not affected by auphen treatment up to 20 μM (S6B Fig)
(p = 0.165, One-Way ANOVA; n = 3 independent experiments). We also wanted to examine
the effects of auphen when only treating cells during the early liver stage. HuH7 cells were
treated with auphen (0.05–20 μM) at the time of infection and parasite load was quantified at
11 hpi, before the parasites begin to replicate, as well as after replication starts at 24 and 44 hpi
(S6C Fig). Parasite load was not found to be significantly inhibited when assessed at 11 hpi
(One-Way ANOVA, Tukey’s post hoc analysis, p > 0.05) even with 20 μM auphen treatment–
the highest concentration tested. This observation indicates that auphen does not have inhibi-
tory effects during the early stages of liver stage development. Additionally, by comparing the

 parasite load from early intrahepatic development (11 hpi) to late development (44 hpi) we
observe that with high concentrations of auphen, parasite load is greater at early times when
compared to later time points. This observation suggests that parasites that are unable to
develop upon auphen treatment are cleared by the host cell. When the parasite load of
auphen-treated cells was assessed at 24 hpi, inhibition was observed at 10 and 20 μM auphen,
but this inhibition was substantially less than that observed at 44 hpi (S6C Fig). Taken together,
this time course study indicates auphen acts between 12 and 48 hpi to inhibit Plasmodium.
The auphen mode of action was further assessed through a phenotypic study. Similar to
AQP3mut cells, auphen significantly reduced the size of EEFs in hepatocytes compared to con-
trol DMSO-treated hepatocytes (Fig 5D). HuH7 cells treated with 1.2 μM auphen developed
EEFs 56 ± 0.08% smaller than DMSO-treated cells (p < 0.0001, unpaired Student’s t-test;
n>100). Furthermore, the number of EEFs in cells treated with 1.2 μM auphen was not signifi-
cantly different from that of wild type cells (Fig 5E) (p = 0.198, two-tailed Student’s t-test;
n = 9). Additionally, to probe whether auphen acts on the host AQP3 and/or the parasite

 aquaporin, we pre-treated sporozoites with auphen prior to infection. Freshly dissected sporo-
zoites were incubated with various concentrations of auphen or DMSO for 30 minutes. After
the incubation, the sporozoites were pelleted and resuspended in media before being used to
infect HuH7 cells. Treatment of sporozoites with 2–10 μM auphen did not significantly reduce
parasite load in HuH7 cells when assessed at 48 hpi (p = 0.926, One-Way ANOVA; n = 2–3
independent experiments) while treating cells with the corresponding concentration of
auphen immediately after infection reduced parasite load by 83.9–99.5% (p < 0.0001, One-
Way ANOVA; n = 2–3 independent experiments) (Fig 5F). Pretreatment of hepatocytes with
auphen also does not result in parasite inhibition (S6D Fig), which was expected as host AQP3
is not significantly expressed until after P. berghei infection.
The effects of auphen on blood-stage Plasmodium parasites was further evaluated. Immu-
nofluorescent staining of AQP3 in P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes was completed to con-
firm the localization of the protein to the PVM as previously described [22]. We found that
AQP3 localizes to the erythrocyte membrane in uninfected cells, but is translocated to the
PVM of P. falciparum-infected cells (Fig 6A). Infected erythrocytes were visualized after treat-
ment with 2 μM auphen or DMSO for 40 hours (Fig 6B). Treatment began during the early
schizont stage to assess the ability of the parasites to complete maturation and invade new
erythrocytes. Across three independent experiments, parasitemia significantly decreased by
75 ± 12% when treated with 2 μM auphen (Fig 6C) compared to DMSO treated erythrocytes
(p = 0.0257, unpaired Student’s t-test). Erythrocyte toxicity was not observed microscopically
in response to auphen treatment. For one biological replicate of P. falciparum auphen treat-
ment, the parasite stages (ring, trophozoite, schizont) were scored to assess their development
in the newly invaded erythrocytes (Fig 6D). Interestingly, the parasites that were able to infect
erythrocytes after auphen treatment exhibited a developmental delay compared to the DMSO
control as indicated by an increase in ring stage parasites and a decrease in trophozoites.
Transcriptome analysis of P. berghei-infected hepatocytes
Our initial RNA-seq screen enabled the identification and validation of AQP3 as an essential
host protein for Plasmodium, highlighting the potential of our transcriptomic approach to dis-
cover new biology. To more broadly explore host pathways that may be critical to Plasmodium,
we performed RNA-seq on additional time points throughout P. berghei infection of HepG2
and HuH7 hepatocytes. Infected cells were collected at early (2–12 hpi), mid (18–24 hpi), and
late (36–48 hpi) time points. Uninfected controls were also collected for both cell lines. In
total, we performed RNA sequencing on 40 samples (S4 Table). We observed a steady decrease
in the proportion of reads mapping to the human transcriptome as a function of time after
infection in both HuH7 and HepG2 cells (Fig 7A). This decrease was expected due to the rising
parasite occupancy of the host cell at later time points and reads that did not map to the
human genome largely mapped to P. berghei. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the gene
expression data showed HepG2 and HuH7 clustered separately, but such discreet clustering
was not observed for individual time points within a cell line (Fig 7B).
We performed a differential gene expression analysis for the infected hepatocytes collected
at early, mid, and late P. berghei infection compared to uninfected controls of the respective
cell line (S5 Table). DEGs (adjusted p < 0.05) are shown for P. berghei-infected HuH7 cells
(Fig 7C). The majority of host genes that are differentially expressed were found to be associ-
ated with the early and mid-time points. Genes involved in cell cycle (ARG1), immune pro-
cesses (IL8) and the chemokine responses (CXCL family of genes) were among the most
highly upregulated, while genes involved in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis (MYCN)
were down-regulated. Other genes of interest to be upregulated included MTRNR2L1 and

 PHLDA1, two anti-apoptotic factors. We then performed a gene set enrichment analysis using
GSEA [34] to identify gene sets and pathways associated with P. berghei infection at various
stages of infection (S6 Table, S7 Fig). Interestingly, cholesterol biosynthesis was the most
highly downregulated pathway during the early- and mid-time points following P. berghei
infection (Fig 7D). Conversely, the fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism
pathway was significantly upregulated during the late stage of P. berghei hepatocyte infection
(Fig 7E). These data suggest that genes in the host hepatocyte are temporally regulated to first

ment for growth and replication.
Discussion
Elucidating the complex interplay between the Plasmodium parasite and its obligatory host
liver cell is critical to understanding how a single sporozoite transforms into thousands of mer-
ozoites. Here we use the transcriptional changes that occur in HepG2 hepatocytes upon P. ber-
ghei infection to identify host factors that may be important for Plasmodium growth and
development. We were particularly interested in genes highly induced upon infection, as the
protein products of these genes could be utilized by the developing parasite. To test this possi-
bility, we selected AQP3, one of the most significantly differentially expressed genes in infected
HepG2 cells (p = 1.55 x 10−7), for further study. Through an independent secondary study
with qRT-PCR analysis, we confirmed that AQP3 mRNA levels increase in P. berghei-infected
HepG2 and HuH7 hepatoma lines.
Aquaporins are a family of water channel proteins that are found in most living organisms
and are essential for the rapid movement of water to maintain cellular homeostasis [35]. AQP3
is an aquaglyceroporin, a unique aquaporin subtype that is highly permeable to both glycerol
and water [36], but is not generally expressed in hepatocytes at the protein level (proteinatlas.
org). Due to the selective induction of AQP3, but not other proteins within the aquaporin fam-
ily in response to Plasmodium infection, we predicted a critical role during the parasite’s liver
stage as a nutrient source for the developing parasite. Using immunofluorescent microscopy,
we show that host AQP3 protein is more abundant in Plasmodium infected hepatocytes com-
pared to uninfected cells and that the protein localizes to the PVM. The PVM, which is derived
from the host cell membrane, is modified by the loss of host proteins and the integration of
secreted parasite proteins [10, 37–39]; however, few host proteins are known to be trafficked
to the PVM after Plasmodium infection of hepatocytes. Host autophagy markers, such as LC3,
surround the PV of infected hepatocytes where they can integrate into the PVM as a pathogen
clearance mechanism by the host cell. In roughly half of infections, LC3 integration into the
PV successfully recruits lysosomes that clear the parasitic infection [40]. Plasmodium infec-
tions that are not successfully cleared by the host cell are able to fully mature and eventually
lose the LC3 localization around the PV. Unlike the recruitment of LC3 and other autophagy
markers to the PVM, here we demonstrate the incorporation of host AQP3 into the PVM in a
manner that is beneficial for the growth and development of the intrahepatic parasite. We also
observe the localization of AQP3 to the PVM of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes, as previ-
ously reported [22]. These data suggest a conserved role of human AQP3 in Plasmodium devel-
opment in multiple stage of the parasitic life cycle as well as multiple species of Plasmodium.
Furthermore, transcriptomic studies of mice chronically infected with T. gondii show a 17-fold
increase in host AQP3 mRNA expression in brain cells [41], suggesting the role of AQP3
could be conserved in other apicomplexans.
The observations that AQP3 expression is induced in response to infection and that the
protein localizes to the PVM, led us to hypothesize that AQP3 is essential for Plasmodium
development during the liver stage. The importance of AQP3 for intrahepatic Plasmodium
by cell lines accounts for 91% of variability, while PCA on the individual cell lines did not reveal discreet clusters. (C) Heatmap of differentially expressed genes

 development is demonstrated by the significant decrease in P. berghei parasite load upon
AQP3 gene depletion (4 targeting siRNA) and genetic disruption (4 different CRISPR cell
lines). Gene depletion of all other aquaporins expressed in hepatocytes indicate that AQP7 and
AQP9 also contribute to Plasmodium development, although to a lesser extent than AQP3.
AQP7 and AQP9 belong to the aquaglyceroporin family of proteins, but their expression is not
induced in response to Plasmodium infection. In contrast, gene depletion of orthodox aqua-
porins did not influence parasite load. The redundant function of AQP7 and AQP9 may be
responsible for the 20% parasite load observed in the AQP3mut hepatocytes, where EEFs were
significantly reduced in size. Taken together with our data that show AQP3 localizes to the
PVM, our work suggests that AQP3 expression is co-opted by the Plasmodium parasite and
trafficked to the PVM for survival.
We predict that AQP3 is recruited and integrated into the PVM to enable nutrient trans-
port. Plasmodium is an obligate intracellular pathogen that requires the host environment for
development. In particular, the rapid replication of the parasite within the PV necessitates a
high demand of nutrients for parasite membrane formation and organelle synthesis. All newly
synthesized membranes of the developing parasite rely on glycerol as a precursor as it is the
backbone of lipid and phospholipid synthesis [42, 43]. Plasmodium can scavenge host lipids
for the rapid assembly of membranes and organelles [44, 45]. The host lipids are tethered to
glycerol and subsequently incorporated into cell membranes as phospholipids. The parasite is
also able to synthesize some nutrients de novo through the FASII pathway, a fatty acid synthe-
sis pathway that is distinct from mammalian biosynthetic pathways [46]. The FASII pathway
has been found to be especially important during the liver stage of the Plasmodium life cycle
[47] and several components of this pathway require glycerol precursors that could be
obtained from the host cell. The fatty acid products of the FASII pathway are then incorpo-
rated into essential lipids, such as glycerophospholipids and acylglycerols [48, 49]. Thus, glyc-
erol is an important component in both the de novo synthesis of fatty acids as well as the
synthesis of plasma membranes from host-scavenged fatty acids.
The importance of glycerol in parasite development has been demonstrated in P. falciparum
glycerol kinase knockout parasites (ΔPfGK) [50]. Glycerol kinase is an enzyme that mediates
the phosphorylation of glycerol to form glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), an essential component
of glycerophospholipids. Upon PfGK deletion, parasite proliferation was reduced by approxi-
mately 45%, which corresponded to a 50% reduction in the incorporation of 14C-glycerol. This
incorporation of 14C-glycerol from the host environment suggests unknown mechanisms of
the parasite to utilize carbon sources other than glycerol kinase. Taken together, these studies
show that nutrient requirements of the Plasmodium parasite are complex, requiring abundant
resources from the host cell and that aquaporins are a protein family that may facilitate this
process. The possible requirement of AQP3 for nutrient acquisition is particularly intriguing
in light of a previous study that suggested the PVM is a molecular sieve for small molecule
movement [51]. Using dyes of varying sizes, the selectivity filter of the PVM was proposed to
be linked to molecular weight, where small molecules like glycerol are predicted to diffuse
freely. Our observations suggest a more complex filtering of solutes occurs, which would
enable greater control of the chemical components within the PV.
The role of aquaporins in Plasmodium infections has been studied for many years, but the
research has primarily focused on the parasite aquaporin. Plasmodium encodes an aquaglycer-
oporin, AQP [42], which has been shown to localize to the parasite plasma membrane where it
transports glycerol to the parasite [21]. Knockout of the parasite AQP significantly reduces the
parasite growth rate but does not affect viability during the blood stage [21]. Based on these
observations, it has been proposed that the parasite aquaporin is a potential drug target [52].
Our data suggest that human AQP3 is recruited to the PVM in hepatocytes to facilitate liver

 stage infection. We predict that AQP3 is important for the delivery of nutrients, possibly glyc-
erol, through the PV, which enables the parasite AQP to then transport the nutrients into the
parasitic cytoplasm to facilitate rapid growth.
Depletion of AQP3 transcripts or genetic disruption of the gene in hepatocytes did not
influence liver cell viability, which was expected as the protein is not generally expressed in
hepatocytes and AQP3 knockout in mice has been previously shown to be non-lethal [24].
These observations suggest that a therapeutic window for host AQP3 inhibition may be found
that reduces parasite load without inhibiting the host cell. To this end, we identified the
AQP3-targeting auphen [32] as a compound that reduces parasite burden during the liver (P.
berghei) and asexual blood stages (P. falciparum) of the parasite’s life cycle. The efficacy of
auphen in inhibiting parasite growth in both hepatocytes and erythrocytes can likely be attrib-
uted to the conserved localization of AQP3 to the PVM in both the liver and blood stages.
Interestingly, AQP3 is highly abundant in human erythrocytes where it is considered the main
channel for glycerol transport [27]. Our data showing liver stage P. berghei and blood stage P.
falciparum inhibition of parasite load by auphen suggests that AQP3 is a host factor that two
Plasmodium species (mouse- and human-infective) rely on in different parasite stages.
Inhibition of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes by auphen had similar phenotypic charac-
teristics to liver stage parasite inhibition. When P. falciparum was treated with auphen for 40
hours starting at the early schizont stage, a significant reduction in parasite load was observed.
We predict auphen’s inhibitory effects do not target parasite invasion, but likely prevents
schizonts from properly developing mature merozoites capable of invading new erythrocytes.
Though confirmation studies are necessary, this hypothesis is supported by the observation
that parasites that have invaded new erythrocytes during auphen treatment exhibit delayed
development into trophozoites.
Auphen is a gold-based compound that inhibits glycerol transport of human AQP3, but
only minimally effects water and urea transport at high concentrations (>100 μM) [33]. It was
first described for the inhibition of AQP3, but has since been shown to inhibit AQP7 glycerol
transport [53]. However, it does not inhibit other orthodox aquaporins, such as AQP1 [32].
The potency of auphen against liver stage parasites was the same when the drug was adminis-
tered at 0 or 24 hpi (EC50 ~ 0.8 μM), indicating the target was not important for invasion or
early stage parasite development. Auphen has been tested in the context of cancers and shown
to inhibit glycerol transport in erythrocytes with an EC50 = 0.80 ± 0.08 μM [32], similar to our
observed P. berghei inhibition in hepatocytes by auphen. During the first 12 hours of P. berghei
infection of hepatocytes, the parasite undergoes morphological changes into the EEF and by
24 hours the volume of the EEF grows four-fold before it begins to divide [8]. The parasite
then divides rapidly 24–55 hpi which requires large amounts of nutrients for the synthesis of
membranes and organelles. Because auphen inhibits parasite development when administered
at 24 hpi, it suggests that AQP3 is needed during the late stage of Plasmodium hepatocyte infec-
tion. This is also supported by our results showing that parasite load is not inhibited when it is
assessed at 11 hpi after treatment with auphen at the time of infection. Additionally, incubating
parasites with auphen prior to infection did not prevent invasion and replication. This lack of
inhibition upon parasite pre-incubation suggests that auphen does not inhibit the parasite
AQP to influence invasion under our experimental conditions, as the compound is known to
be an irreversible inhibitor of aquaglyceroporins active site cysteine residues [33]. Unfortu-
nately, the complementary host preincubation study to determine auphen specificity to AQP3
is complicated by the fact that the protein is only upregulated many hours after infection.
Indeed, host cell pretreatment with auphen did not influence parasite load in liver cells, sug-
gesting that the target is translated after infection. But we cannot rule out other potential para-
site or host proteins that may be a target for auphen. However, the similarities in infection

 phenotypes between AQPmut cells and auphen treated cells support the targeting of host AQP3
by auphen.
In order to obtain a more robust understanding of the host response to Plasmodium infec-
tion during the liver stage, we performed RNA-seq of an additional 28 samples of an alternate
hepatocyte cell line, HuH7, infected with P. berghei. Principle component analysis indicated
that 91% of the variation observed within the 40 samples we collected could be attributed to
different expression profiles of the two cell lines, HuH7 and HepG2. In agreement with a past
microarray study that reported changes to host hepatocyte transcriptome expression in
response to Plasmodium infection [17], we find that early time points (2–12 hours) after P. ber-
ghei infection accounted for the majority of differentially expressed genes. Some of the most
highly upregulated genes included anti-apoptotic MTRNR2L1 and PHLDA1 –an exciting
finding as several studies have shown that apoptosis is inhibited during Plasmodium invasion
of hepatocytes [54, 55]. Gene set enrichment analysis also indicated that cholesterol biosynthe-
sis genes are downregulated at early and mid-time points after infection, an interesting obser-
vation as it has been shown that Plasmodium relies on cholesterol acquisition from the host
hepatocyte [56]. However, similar to studies that have shown an increase in cell metabolism
during the blood stage [43, 57], we find that genes that are involved in metabolic pathways,
such as fatty acid, triacylglycerol, and ketone body metabolism, are enriched among the genes
upregulated upon P. berghei infection. The activation of this metabolic pathway during the late
stage could suggest a breakdown of stored nutrients within the host liver cell that can then be
utilized by the developing parasite. Future work dissecting the genes in these pathways will be
critical to better understanding the host response to infection. Together our dataset of two
hepatocyte cell lines, HepG2 and HuH7, is a rich resource for identifying future areas of func-
tional research in host-pathogen interactions during the liver stage of malaria.
In this work, we have uncovered a strategy by which Plasmodium may secure small mole-
cules in hepatocytes while remaining protected within the PV. Our study suggests that the par-
asites have a route to induce expression of host AQP3, which is incorporated in to the PVM to
ensure development. Further studies investigating metabolism within the PV will be critical
for testing if AQP3 is importing glycerol as a nutrient source for the parasites, as it remains
possible that the parasites rely on AQP3 to maintain homeostasis or remove toxic waste. How-
ever, no strategies currently exist to separate viable parasites in the PV from the host liver cell
and the low infection rate of hepatocytes hinders metabolic labeling studies. The identification
of AQP3 and other potential host factors that are differentially regulated throughout the liver
stage of malaria has implications for understanding host-parasite interactions. Understanding
these interactions may in turn enable the development of prophylactic measures to prevent
malaria. Thus, elucidating how Plasmodium alters host gene expression can further enhance
our understanding of the host-pathogen processes that enable the parasites to cause disease.
To that end, we have generated a comprehensive data set of DEGs at early, mid and late P. ber-
ghei infection of hepatocytes. We believe this data will be a valuable resource for further uncov-
ering interactions between the Plasmodium parasite and its host liver cell.

Synchronization was performed using 5% sorbitol as previously described [58].
Collection of samples for RNA-sequencing
T25 flasks were seeded with 3x105 HepG2 or 8x104 HuH7 cells. Cells were infected with 1x105
GFP-expressing P. berghei-ANKA sporozoites 24 hours after seeding. Infected cells and unin-
fected controls were sorted at various times post-infection directly into lysis buffer using the
BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences) at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute. Sytox blue
was used as a live/dead cell indicator (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was extracted using
SMART-seq v4 Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for Sequencing (Clonetech) and libraries were pre-
pared at the Duke Next Generation Sequencing Core Facility and sequenced on the Illumina
HiSeq 4000 as 50 base pair single-end reads.
RNA-sequencing analysis
FASTQ files comprising reads from RNA-seq were tested for quality using FastQC v.0.11.5

Next, alignment was performed using the STAR v.2.5.1a aligner [61] to map reads to the refer-
ence Homo sapiens GRCh37.82 genome. PCR duplicates were marked using Picard v.2.8.2
(http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). The final output was a matrix of read counts per tran-
script. We used DESeq2 [62] to normalize the read count matrix, and to perform differential
analysis. Geneset enrichment analysis was performed using GSEA [34, 63]. All statistical analy-
ses and plots were generated using R v3.4.3.
qRT-PCR
HepG2 or HuH7 cells infected with GFP-expressing P. berghei ANKA were sorted along with
uninfected controls at 48 hpi directly into lysis buffer. RNA from samples were extracted using
the Quick-RNA microprep (Zymo) according to manufacturer’s protocol. cDNA was synthe-
sized using GoScript reverse transcriptase (Promega) according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Relative abundance of H. sapiens AQP3 was quantified using a SYBR Green Light Cycler 480
(Roche) according to manufacturer’s protocol in a 96-well plate. Relative abundance of AQP3
expression in P. berghei-infected cells was compared to uninfected cells and normalized to the
H. sapiens 18S housekeeping gene (primers listed in S1 Table). qRT-PCR was run in technical
triplicates. RNA was isolated for 3 biological replicates for HepG2 cells and 4 biological repli-
cates for HuH7 cells.
Immunofluorescence microscopy
HepG2 and HuH7 cells (2.5x105) were seeded on cover slips in 24-wells plates and infected
with P. berghei with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:4. Cells were fixed at various times
post infection in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature. Cells were washed
three times in PBS and were subsequently blocked with 3% BSA for 45 minutes at room

 temperature. Cells were incubated in primary antibodies, rabbit-anti Pb heat-shock protein 70
[64], rabbit anti-HsAQP3 (Rockland), and goat anti-UIS4 (LSBio) that were diluted 1:100,
1:300, and 1:1,000, respectively, for 1.5 hours at room temperature or 4˚C overnight. Cells
were washed three times with PBS and incubated in secondary antibodies, AlexaFluor 488 goat
anti-mouse and AlexaFluor 568 donkey anti-rabbit diluted 1:400 (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
for 1 hour at room temperature. For UIS4, staining AlexaFluor 488 donkey anti-goat was used
at 1:5,000. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with 0.5 μg/mL DAPI for 7 minutes.
Cells were washed once more with PBS and slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). iRBCs samples were fixed, permeabilized and blocked as described
previously [65]. Incubations with anti-HsAQP3 primary antibody and secondary antibody
were completed as described for P. berghei. After nuclear staining in 1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342,
cells were imaged on a widefield fluorescent microscope.
Images were taken using the Zeiss Axio Observer wide field fluorescence microscope or the
Zeiss 880 Airyscan inverted confocal. 3D stacks were acquired on a Zeiss LSM 510 inverted
confocal microscope with a 100x 1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat oil objective. 3D images were con-
structed and colocalization parameters were determined using Imaris software (Bitplane). A
minimum of three independent experiments were completed for all localization studies. EEF
size quantification was completed using ImageJ. Number of EEFs for AQP3mut cells and
auphen treated cells were quantified/well in 384-well plates. Three independent experiments
were performed with 5–10 wells/condition in each experiment.
Plasmodium inhibition assays
Parasites isolated from salivary glands of infected A. stephensi were used to infect HuH7 and
HepG2 hepatocytes as previously described [66]. Cell viability and parasite load were assessed
using CellTiter-Fluor (Promega) and Bright-Glo (Promega) reagents, respectively, according
to manufacturer’s protocols. Fluorescence and luminescence readouts were collected using the
EnVision plate reader (Perkin Elmer). For inhibition assays, auphen was synthesized [67] and
20–0.01 μM of compound was added to P. berghei ANKA-infected HuH7/HepG2 cells or P.
falciparum Dd2-infected erythrocytes 10 minutes post infection in a dose-dependent manner
with DMSO normalized to 1% in all wells. P. berghei parasite load upon auphen treatment was
quantified using the luciferase reporter as described above in biological triplicate. P. falciparum
Dd2 parasite load was assessed with DAPI nuclear staining as previously described in biologi-
cal duplicate [66].
For auphen pre-incubation studies, freshly harvested sporozoites from mosquito salivary
glands were incubated with 2–10 μM auphen for 30 minutes at room temperature. As a con-
trol, sporozoites were also incubated with DMSO and all treatments had 1% DMSO. After
incubation, the compound was removed by centrifugation and resuspension of sporozoites in
untreated media. Cells were pretreatment with the same concentrations of auphen. After a 30
minute incubation with auphen or DMSO control (1%), media was gently aspirated and fresh
media was added to the wells.
For auphen treatment of P. falciparum, synchronized iRBCs in the schizont stage were
treated with 2 μM auphen for 40 hours. After 40 hours, Geimsa (Sigma-Aldrich) stained blood
smears were imaged on a brightfield microscope. Parasitemia was calculated by counting the
number of P. falciparum infected red blood cells out of a total of 1,200 cells.
Depletion of aquaporin expression by RNA interference
HuH7 cells were reverse transfected with 50 nM siRNAs (S1 Table) at 2x103 cells/well in
384-well plates. siRNAs (Qiagen) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher

 Scientific) according to manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were reverse transfected in 6 technical
replicates and in duplicate plates. One plate was used to assess RNA knockdown efficiency 48
hours post transfection using Quick-RNA MicroPrep (Zymo). cDNA was generated using
GoScript (Promega) and qRT-PCR was performed as previously described to assess the knock-
down of genes of interest compared to mock-transfected cells. Primers that were used for the
qRT-PCR are listed in S1 Table. 48 hours post transfection the duplicate plate was infected
with 4x103 luciferase-expressing P. berghei ANKA sporozoites per well. 48 hpi cell viability and
parasite load were assessed as described above. Each experiment was completed with 6 techni-
cal replicates and three independent experiments were performed.
Generation of AQP3 mutant cell line
Four separate AQP3mut cell lines were generated using different guide RNAs (gRNA). The
gRNA sequences were determined (crispr.mit.edu) for recruitment of Cas9 to either the first
or second exon of AQP3 and are listed in S3 Table. Tails were added to gRNA sequence for
introduction into px33034 (Addgene plasmid #42230), a plasmid containing a human codon-
optimized SpCas9. px330 was digested using BbsI (NEB) for one hour according to manufac-
turer’s protocol and gel purified. Reverse complements of gRNA were annealed using T4 liga-
tion buffer (NEB). Linearized px330 and gRNA were ligated using T4 ligase (NEB) according
to manufacturer’s protocol. Ligated plasmid was transformed into XL-Gold competent cells
and plasmids were isolated using a standard mini-prep kit (Qiagen). Sequencing was verified
using Eton BioScience Inc.
HuH7 cells (2x105/per well) were seeded in a 6-well plate in DMEM. Cells were co-trans-
fected with pX330, containing the gRNA sequence, and pCDNA3.0 containing a blasticidin
resistance marker using Lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. Cells that were transfected with gRNAs targeting exon 2 were transfected
with two separate gRNA-containing px330 plasmids, homologous to the second exon of AQP3
and 6 nucleotides away from one another. Mock cells containing no plasmids were included.
HuH7 cells containing plasmids were then trypsinized and replated into 10 cm tissue culture
plates in cDMEM 24 hours after transfection. Cells were washed and then cDMEM+5 μg/mL
blasticidin was added 48 hours after transfection. Mock cells were monitored for cell death
daily until no surviving cells remained. Transfected HuH7 cells were then single-cell sorted
into 96-well plates and maintained in standard culture medium as described above. Popula-
tions were grown from single cells and expression of AQP3 and Actin RNA was assessed by
RT-PCR (AQP3 F: ATGGGTCGACAGAAGGAGCT, R:TCAGATCTGCTCCTTGTGCTT;
ACTB F: GCCTCGCCTTTGCCGA, R: GTTGAAGGTCTCAAACATGATCTGG). RNA was
extracted and cDNA synthesized as previously described and genomic DNA (gDNA) was puri-
fied using the Quick-DNA microprep (Zymo). Primers to amplify both exons of the AQP3
gene were designed as well as for the full-length AQP3 mRNA (S1 Table). Clonal populations
showing no expression of the full-length transcript were selected for further evaluation and
designated as AQP3mut cell lines. Parasite load in the AQP3mut cell lines infected with lucifer-
ase- or GFP-expressing P. berghei were compared to wildtype HuH7 cells as previously
described.
Auphen synthesis
Reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere with dry solvents and oven-dried
glassware under anhydrous conditions unless specified otherwise. Reagents were purchased at
the highest commercial quality and used without further purification, unless otherwise stated.

[AuCl2(phen)]Cl (Auphen) was prepared as previously described [67]. Briefly, to a solution
of HAuCl4●3H2O (100 mg, 0.254 mmol) in EtOH (1.0 mL) a solution of 1,10 phenanthroline
(151 mg, 0.838 mmol) in EtOH (1.0 mL) was added slowly. The reaction was stirred at reflux
for 4 hours. The reaction was cooled to room temperature, filtered and washed with cold
EtOH (3 x 5 mL), affording pure auphen as orange crystals (116 mg, 0.240 mmol, 95%). 1H
NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6): δ 9.31 (dd, J = 4.9, 1.6 Hz, 2H), 9.08 (dd, J = 8.2, 1.5 Hz, 2H), 8.37
