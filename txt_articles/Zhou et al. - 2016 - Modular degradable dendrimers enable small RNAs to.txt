RNA-based cancer therapies are hindered by the lack of delivery
vehicles that avoid cancer-induced organ dysfunction, which exacer-
bates carrier toxicity. We address this issue by reporting modular
degradable dendrimers that achieve the required combination of
high potency to tumors and low hepatotoxicity to provide a pro-
nounced survival benefit in an aggressive genetic cancer model. More
than 1,500 dendrimers were synthesized using sequential, orthogonal
reactions where ester degradability was systematically integrated
with chemically diversified cores, peripheries, and generations. A lead
dendrimer, 5A2-SC8, provided a broad therapeutic window: identi-
fied as potent [EC50 < 0.02 mg/kg siRNA against FVII (siFVII)] in dose–
response experiments, and well tolerated in separate toxicity studies
in chronically ill mice bearing MYC-driven tumors (>75 mg/kg den-
drimer repeated dosing). Delivery of let-7g microRNA (miRNA) mimic
inhibited tumor growth and dramatically extended survival. Efficacy
stemmed from a combination of a small RNA with the dendrimer’s
own negligible toxicity, therefore illuminating an underappreciated
complication in treating cancer with RNA-based drugs.

S
ince the discovery of RNAi and the recognition of its ther-
apeutic potential, there has been a continuous search for
optimal delivery carriers (1–10). Tremendous progress has been
made with regard to delivery efficacy of small RNAs to healthy
livers, but the clinically required combination of high delivery
potency to tumors and low hepatotoxicity is not currently met
by existing delivery vehicles. This challenge represents an un-
appreciated complication in treating cancer with RNA-based
drugs. Primary liver cancer, a chronic consequence of liver cir-
rhosis, is a leading cause of cancer death and a major global
health problem (11). Unfortunately, all five phase III human
clinical trials of small-molecule drugs for hepatocellular carci-
noma (HCC) treatment failed within the past four years in part
because debilitating, late-stage liver dysfunction amplifies drug
toxicity (11, 12). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) present a promising
alternative cancer treatment strategy because they can function
as tumor suppressors by concurrently targeting multiple path-
ways involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival
(13–19). In this study, we used a highly aggressive, inducible
MYC-driven transgenic liver cancer model where the chance for
successful therapy is very limited, in equal part due to the rapidly
growing cancer and the compromised function of the overtaken
liver. Tumors grow endogenously from within the liver in this
genetically engineered model, which is biologically faithful and
lethal, in contrast to standard xenograft or orthotopic models
derived from cell line implantation (20). The development of
dendrimer carriers that can mediate a therapeutic benefit in this
difficult-to-treat model was set as the paramount goal of the
study. Notably, we find that high potency and low toxicity are of
critical importance in the context of aggressive liver cancer
models, where the carrier’s own toxicity can negate the benefit of
on-target small-RNA therapies.
To achieve this balance of low toxicity and high potency, we
reasoned that one must more precisely examine the influence
of chemical structure by expanding the structural diversity and
molecular size of delivery carriers. Dendrimers represented an
ideal system for this goal because they possess the same high
degree of molecular uniformity as small molecules and the broad
theoretical space for chemical tuning as polydisperse polymers
(21–23). These intrinsic characteristics enable dendrimers to
have unique properties for various biomedical applications (24–
26). In gene delivery, most studies have used the limited number
of commercial dendrimers for further chemical modification
(27–29). However, orthogonal click chemistry has recently made
a transformative impact on the synthesis of dendritic materials
through protecting group-free methodologies to overcome his-
torical limitations in fidelity and provide a larger toolbox for
dendrimer design (30–34). The expansion of dendrimer appli-
cations therefore depends on the ability to easily tune the size,
chemistry, topology, and, ultimately, dendrimer physical prop-
erties through chemical synthesis.
We hypothesized that, through introduction of ester bonds
and molecular diversity at each expansion step, modular de-
gradable dendrimers would possess a critical balance of low
toxicity and high delivery potency (Fig. 1). We further speculated
that chemical modulation of cores, peripheries, and generations
may be accelerated by utilization of efficient click reactions to
enable a large increase in both the total number (>1,500) and
Significance
Liver cancer is a leading cause of death and a global health
problem. Unfortunately, five small-molecule drugs for hepa-
tocellular carcinoma (HCC) recently failed phase III clinical trials
partly because late-stage liver dysfunction amplifies drug
toxicity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) present a promising alternative
treatment strategy but require development of delivery vehi-
cles that can avoid this cancer-induced dysfunction, which ex-
acerbates toxicity. We overcame this challenge by developing
dendrimer nanoparticles that mediate miRNA delivery to late-
stage liver tumors with low hepatotoxicity. An aggressive,
MYC-driven transgenic liver cancer model was used to examine
let-7g tumor suppressor efficacy, resulting in a significant
survival benefit. These dendrimer carriers provide high potency
in tumors without negatively affecting normal tissues, solving
a critical issue in treating aggressive liver cancer.

 chemical diversity of dendrimers. Biocompatible, degradable
esters were included as a key design component because all
RNAi therapies are transient and require sustained and repeated
treatment. This ultimately enabled discovery of well-tolerated
small-RNA carriers that could produce a therapeutic benefit in a
challenging liver cancer model.
Efficacious delivery requires overcoming a series of extracellu-
lar and intracellular barriers (1). The physicochemical properties
of small RNAs (high molecular weight, anionic charge, and hy-
drophilic nature) prevent passive diffusion across cell membranes.
Studies of lipid and polymer carriers have implicated at least two
common elements: chemical groups to bind small RNAs and
nanoparticle (NP)-stabilizing hydrophobicity, which combine to
encapsulate RNA molecules inside stable NPs and release small
RNAs into the cytosol after endocytosis (35). Particular tertiary
amines with optimal pKa, alkyl chains, and defined topology/
structure have been identified in effective carriers (2–10, 35–37).
Despite these advances, demonstration of effective survival
benefit in aggressive genetic models of human cancer has not
been achieved with synthetic carriers due to the lack of delivery
vehicles that avoid cancer-induced organ dysfunction. To address
this, we designed a dendrimer library organized through binding,
stabilization, and chemical functionality within the cores and
peripheries. In vitro and in vivo evaluation identified dendrimers
with optimal topological structures and high delivery efficacy
(EC50 of FVII knockdown < 0.02 mg/kg). Structure–activity
knowledge was used to rationally design additional carriers with
predicted in vivo activity. Evaluation of lead dendrimer candi-
dates identified 5A2-SC8 as exhibiting low toxicity after repeated
75 mg/kg dendrimer i.v. dosing in chronically ill, tumor-bearing
mice. Finally, we demonstrate that 5A2-SC8 can deliver a let-7g
tumor suppressor miRNA with high in vivo potency to suppress
tumor growth and result in a dramatic survival benefit of trans-
genic mice bearing aggressive, MYC-driven liver cancer. These
findings suggest that modular degradable dendrimers may
greatly expand the scope of chemical discovery research for
therapeutic dendrimer delivery applications, ultimately providing
new avenues for development of RNA cancer treatments by
expansion of the therapeutic window.
Results
A Modular Synthesis Strategy Allowed Diversification in the Chemical
Functionality and Molecular Weight of Ester-Based Dendrimer Carriers.
Liver cancer is a challenging host for therapeutic intervention
because drug-induced hepatotoxicity can exacerbate the un-
derlying liver disease (12). Therefore, to achieve effective RNAi-
mediated therapy, a balance of high potency and low toxicity
of the carrier has to be maintained. This requires a versatile
chemical synthesis strategy to easily tune the delivery carrier
in terms of molecular weight, chemical structure, and ultimate
physical properties (Fig. 2). Motivated by recent methodology
developments in orthogonal click chemistry (30–34), we envi-
sioned that efficient sequential reactions could accelerate
dendrimer synthesis, thereby allowing systematic fine-tuning
of small-RNA binding affinity and NP-stabilizing hydrophobicity
of dendrimer carriers. Particularly, the use of asymmetric
monomers was reported as an effective strategy to construct
polyester dendrimers with a series of generations (33). Inspired by
that methodology, we investigated the feasibility of sequential aza-
and sulfa-Michael additions to 2-(acryloyloxy)ethyl methacry-
late (AEMA) as a strategy to synthesize a degradable dendrimer
library with enough chemical diversity to solve the delivery chal-
lenge to vulnerable cancerous hosts.
Before attempting to synthesize a library of dendrimers, we
had to first verify that the asymmetric AEMA method is capable
of yielding diverse dendrimers using a variety of chemically dis-
tinct amine and thiol compounds. Quantitative reaction conversion
and high tolerance of different amine/thiol functionalities is
required to synthesize monodisperse dendrimers and ensure
accurate small-RNA delivery results. To examine the robust-
ness of this chemistry, we chose the most difficult starting
materials, tris(2-aminoethyl)amine with six N–H bonds and
tetradecylamine with a 14-carbon-length alkyl chain to test
structural limits of the orthogonal Michael addition reactions.
Both tris(2-aminoethyl)amine and tetradecylamine could quan-
titatively and selectively react with the acrylate functionality
in AEMA after 24 h in the presence of 5 mol% of butylated
hydroxytoluene (to inhibit radical formation) at 50 °C,
whereas AEMA by itself remained unreacted under these
conditions (SI Appendix, Figs. S1 and S2). Next, we focused on
2-(butylamino)ethanethiol and 1-tetradecanethiol to test sulfa-
Michael addition. Using the established aza-Michael addition
conditions (DMSO as solvent without any catalyst), conver-
sion of 1-tetradecanethiol was less than 80% (SI Appendix, Figs.
S3 and S4). To achieve quantitative conversion, we screened a
series of catalysts and conditions to improve the reaction con-
version. Ultimately,
dimethylphenylphosphine
(DMPP)
was
found to be an effective a catalyst to achieve the final products
under reaction at low concentration (≥125 mM), small scale
(∼20 mg on average), and in high conversion (100% by 1H NMR)
(SI Appendix, Figs. S3 and S4).
We then used the optimized sequential aza- and sulfa-Michael
reactions to react with ester-based AEMA to construct a chemically
diversified library of degradable dendrimers through various pa-
rameters: core (C), linkage (L), and periphery (P) (Fig. 2). We
initially evaluated the effects of small-RNA binding affinity and NP-
stabilizing hydrophobicity of dendrimer carriers by reacting 42 core-
forming amines C and 36 periphery-modifying thiols P to generate a
1,512 first-generation (G1) dendrimer library. The resulting com-
pounds possessed diversity in the chemical composition and number
of branches. We chose esters as the key degradable linkage (L)
because polyesters are used in Food and Drug Administration-ap-
proved drug delivery products with minimal toxicity (38). At each
dendrimer growth step, the ester number increases, which provides
an opportunity to identify degradable dendrimers with balanced
potency and toxicity. The library was established effectively with high
purity (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Concurrent delivery efficacy results
allowed for optimization during the synthesis process (SI Appendix,
Fig. S6). In particular, structure–activity relationships (SARs) that
emerged allowed for the rational design of higher-generation den-
drimers with predicted activity to validate our approach. We pre-
pared multibranched dendrimers by choosing polyamines with five
or six NH bonds (such as natural amines, spermidine, and sper-
mine). We synthesized higher-generation (G2 to G4) dendrimers via
generation expansion reactions (SI Appendix, Fig. S7), starting from
lower branching amine cores. This process successfully allowed us to
take amine cores that were inactive in the in vitro screen, and then
rationally design higher-generation dendrimers with in vivo activity.
All lead dendrimers were resynthesized in larger scale and purified
by flash chromatography before conducting in vivo studies.
Degradable Dendrimers Can Overcome Extracellular and Intracellular
Barriers to Enable Delivery. We first identified which dendrimers
can mediate siRNA to overcome intracellular barriers by screening

RNA-based liver cancer therapies are hindered by the lack of potent
and nontoxic delivery vehicles that avoid late-stage liver dysfunction that
exacerbates toxicity. We envisioned that a modular design would allow
discovery of dendrimers that balance low hepatotoxicity and high in vivo
small-RNA delivery potency to tumor cells by fine-tuning of the identity and
position of functional groups within dendrimer architectures.

 the 1,512 member library for the ability to deliver siRNA in vitro to
HeLa cells that stably expressed luciferase. Dendrimers were for-
mulated into NPs containing luciferase-targeting siRNA (siLuc)
and the helper lipids cholesterol, 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos-
phocholine (DSPC), and lipid PEG2000 (3, 4). Intracellular de-
livery potential was assessed by quantifying reduction of luciferase
expression without affecting cell viability (Fig. 3A). Eighty-eight hits
were identified that mediated >50% knockdown of luciferase ac-
tivity, which corresponded to a 6% hit rate across the entire library.
The heat map was divided into structural zones and analyzed fur-
ther based on branch type, number, and length (SI Appendix, Fig.
S6). We found that dendrimers with an siRNA-binding core and a
NP-stabilizing
periphery
had
much
higher
intracellular
siRNA delivery potential. Hydrophobic stabilization from the
dendrimer periphery likely results in increased hydrophobic pack-
ing that provides additional NP stability (39). Further examination
of branch number and branch lengths revealed that dendrimers
with a binding core and three to six SC5-SC12 branches have >25%
chance to deliver siLuc into HeLa cells with >50% luciferase
knockdown (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
Having identified dendrimers that can overcome intracellular
barriers, we next identified the dendrimers that can also over-
come extracellular barriers to deliver siRNA in vivo. We selected
50 G1–G4 dendrimers based on in vitro delivery efficacy and
SAR analysis, aiming to maximize chemical diversity. We eval-
uated dendrimers for their ability to silence Factor VII (FVII) in
hepatocytes because this blood-clotting factor can be readily
quantified from a small serum sample (3, 4). Dendrimers were
formulated with an siRNA against FVII (siFVII) and were in-
jected i.v. into mice at a dose of 1 mg/kg siRNA. FVII activity
was quantified 3 d postinjection. We found that the most potent
G1 dendrimers for in vivo delivery contained a binding core and
four to six branches with SC8-12 periphery composition (Fig.
3B). Interestingly, the optimal carriers for in vivo liver delivery
were lower-generation (G1) dendrimers that have structural
similarity to lipidoids (2, 3). Within formulated NPs that contain
DSPC, cholesterol, and lipid PEG, there may be structural and
size limitations to optimal packing within the NP morphology
(39). Nevertheless, higher-generation dendrimers of 1A2, 2A2,
and 3A3 and 3A5 with four to six SC branches did demonstrate
improved siRNA delivery compared with their lower-branch
number precursors, suggesting ways to rationally design and
improve carriers. Dendrimers with eight branches were less ac-
tive, further validating the established SAR information that the
most potent dendrimers contain an amine-rich binding core and
four to six SC8-SC12 branches. We also measured the apparent
pKa of the formulated NPs using the 2-(p-toluidino)-6-naptha-
lene sulfonic acid assay (TNS) (8). Lead dendrimers possessed an
apparent pKa between 6.3 and 6.6 (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), which is in
good agreement with other studies of lipid and lipidoid NPs (8–10).
To further understand in vivo siRNA delivery to the liver, we
studied biodistribution and in vivo knockdown capability. 3A5-
SC14, 4A3-SC8, and 5A2-SC8 dendrimers were formulated with
Cy5.5-labeled siRNA/siFVII and injected into mice i.v. These
NPs have nearly identical size, charge (ζ potential), and siRNA
encapsulation efficiency in PBS (SI Appendix, Fig. S9 A–C).
Their biodistribution was quantified by whole-animal and organ
imaging after 24 h, and FVII activity was measured 3 d after
injection. Free siRNA was primarily cleared through the kidneys,
whereas 3A5-SC14, 4A3-SC8, and 5A2-SC8 all mediated siRNA
accumulation mainly in the liver (SI Appendix, Fig. S9D). These
dendrimers show varying capability to silence gene expression in
hepatocytes based on dendrimer structure. 4A3-SC8 and 5A2-
SC8 enabled >95% FVII knockdown at 1 mg/kg, whereas 3A5-
SC14 only enabled 40% knockdown at 3 mg/kg (SI Appendix, Fig.
S9E). Despite nearly identical NP physical properties and bio-
distribution, there was a significant difference in siRNA-medi-
ated silencing. These data clearly show that, although most NPs
localize to the liver, cell type-specific uptake and intracellular
release attributes can vary greatly with different dendrimers
according to chemical structure.

A modular strategy for diversifying the
chemical functionality and size of ester-based den-
drimers allowed discovery of potent and nontoxic
dendrimers for in vivo small-RNA delivery to tumor
cells. (A) Orthogonal reactions accelerated the syn-
thesis of >1,500 modular degradable dendrimers by
combination of 42 cores (C) and 36 peripheries (P)
through degradable linkages (L) and generations.
The library was established via sequential reactions.
First, amines (C) with a series of N–H bonds reacted
quantitatively and selectively with the less steric
acrylate groups of AEMA (L). The products (C–L)
then quantitatively reacted with various thiols (P)
under
optimized
DMPP-catalyzed
conditions.
(B)
Dendrimers were independently modulated with
chemically diverse amines and thiols. Selected amines
were divided into two categories: ionizable amines
(1A‒6A) to tune RNA binding from C that generated
one to six branched dendrimers, and alkyl amines
(1H‒2H) to tune NP C stabilization. Alkyl thiols (SC1‒
SC19) and alcohol/carboxylic acid terminated thiols
(SO1‒SO9) were selected to tune NP P stabilization.
Aminothiols (SN1‒SN11) were selected to tune P
RNA binding. G2–G4 higher-generation dendrimers
with multiple branches were also synthesized using
generation expansion reactions (SI Appendix, Fig. S7).

 in vivo toxicity of the top five degradable dendrimers first in
healthy wild-type mice and then in chronically ill mice bearing
aggressive liver tumors. We used a clinically relevant Tet-Off MYC
inducible transgenic liver cancer model (SI Appendix, Fig. S10) to
provide a difficult delivery challenge that captures late-stage dis-
ease (20, 40). This model was used first to evaluate toxicity, then to
examine tumor cell delivery potential, and finally for efficacy
studies. Because tumors are more aggressive when MYC is over-
expressed at earlier developmental time points, we induced MYC
immediately after birth (day 0), which resulted in liver tumors that
grow rapidly after initiation (Fig. 4A). About 5% of the liver is
cancerous by the age of 26 d (day 26), and after an additional 2 wk,
the liver becomes consumed by the disease (∼75% tumor by day
40). NPs were formulated with nonimmunogenic control siRNA to
best evaluate the toxicity of the individual dendrimers themselves.
Size and ζ potential measurements of each NP in PBS buffer
showed similar size, 64–80 nm in diameter, and near-neutral
surface charge for all dendrimers (SI Appendix, Fig. S11). This
suggests that any observed toxicity can be attributed to the in-
dividual dendrimer structures. Each formulated NP was injected
i.v. into healthy mice at a 4 mg/kg control siRNA (siCTR) dose
(100 mg/kg dendrimer). Body weight loss was used as a simple but
informative parameter to quickly identify nontoxic dendrimers.
After injection with 4A3-SC8, mice became sick and lost nearly
20% of their weight on the first day postinjection (Fig. 4B). Mice
injected with 4A1-SC8 and 5A3-SC8 NPs lost about 7% body
weight on the first day, and the weight loss did not recover on the
second day. More positively, mice injected with 5A2-SC8 and 6A3-
SC12 NPs were minimally affected and gained weight normally
after the first day.
Based on these results, we chose 5A2-SC8 and 6A3-SC12 for
further evaluation of their in vivo toxicity in chronically ill mice
bearing aggressive liver cancer with single and multiple injec-
tions. At the age of 32 d (day 32), mice with livers dispersed with
tumors were injected with 5A2-SC8 or 6A3-SC12 NPs at 3 mg/kg
siCTR dose (75 mg/kg dendrimer). Mice receiving 5A2-SC8 NPs
were mildly affected, whereas those mice receiving 6A3-SC12
NPs maintained a 10% body weight loss and could not recover
(SI Appendix, Fig. S12). After multiple injections, these mice
died 7 d earlier compared with mice that received no treatment
because of the toxicity of 6A3-SC12 carrier (Fig. 4C). These data
show that small changes in chemical structure can produce large
changes in toxicity. More significantly, it is clear that tumor-bearing
mice are more sensitive to intervention than healthy mice.
To further examine toxicity, 5A2-SC8 was hydrolyzed into small-
molecule byproducts (SI Appendix, Fig. S13). The isolated degra-
dation products were nontoxic at relevant concentrations and pos-
sessed the same cytotoxicity profile as the intact parent 5A2-SC8
formulated NPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S14). 5A2-SC8 NPs were also
stable in conditions designed to mimic injection, physiological, and
superphysiological conditions. siRNA remained entrapped for >6 d
without leakage, even in 50% serum conditions (SI Appendix, Fig.
S15). Additionally, the NPs remained small (∼80 nm) and narrowly
distributed for >6 d in PBS (SI Appendix, Fig. S16) and for >2 d in
50% serum conditions (SI Appendix, Fig. S17) without aggrega-
tion. Ultimately, 5A2-SC8 emerged as an optimal degradable
dendrimer with a broad therapeutic window. It was identified as
potent (EC50 < 0.02 mg/kg siFVII) in dose–response experiments
(Fig. 4D), while being well tolerated in separate toxicity studies.

Degradable dendrimers were identified that balance low toxicity
and high delivery efficacy in mice bearing aggressive liver cancer. (A) Tumors
grow rapidly after initiation in the MYC inducible transgenic model. All liver
images are in proportional scale. The size of the liver, as well as the per-
centage of tumors, increases as the liver becomes consumed by the disease.
White cancerous regions are visible at day 26 and progressively develop.
(B) Wild-type, healthy mice (day 26) were injected i.v. with lead NPs at 4 mg/kg
siCTR (100 mg/kg dendrimer) (n = 3). Body weight change varied among the
formulations according to the dendrimer identity. (C) Kaplan–Meier survival

bearing mice (a vulnerable host), toxicity of the carrier was exaggerated, and
only 5A2-SC8 was able to be well tolerated without affecting survival (SI Ap-
pendix, Fig. S12). (D) 5A2-SC8 NPs possess an EC50 of 0.02 mg/kg. 5A2-SC8 en-

 therapeutic miRNA mimic for liver cancer therapy, we again
used the aggressive, MYC transgenic liver cancer model induced
at day 0 (40). These mice develop rapidly growing cancers re-
sembling pediatric hepatoblastoma (HB), a tumor type that
shares many of the molecular features of HCC. Abdominal dis-
tention from mass effect was grossly visible after only 20 d.
Without intervention, mice died within 60 d after birth. Given
the speed and lethality of this model, there are limited oppor-
tunities for successful therapy.
We first examined whether 5A2-SC8 NPs could deliver siRNA
into tumor cells. By the age of 41 d (day 41), the livers of these
transgenic mice had dramatically increased in size and were full
of cancerous tissues (Fig. 5A). On day 40, 1 mg/kg Cy5.5-labeled
siRNA was administered i.v. in 5A2-SC8 NPs. At 24 h post-
injection, fluorescence imaging showed 5A2-SC8 mediated siRNA
accumulation in the cancerous liver, with only minor accumula-
tion in the spleen and kidneys (Fig. 5A). High liver uptake of
5A2-SC8 NPs was achieved, despite cancerous livers being much
larger than normal livers (SI Appendix, Fig. S18A). To further
confirm that 5A2-SC8 NPs can deliver siRNA in vivo into tumor
cells, tissues were collected and imaged 24 h after i.v. injection.
In H&E-stained sections, small and mitotically active sheets of
cells clearly delineated malignant from nonmalignant regions of
the liver (SI Appendix, Fig. S18B). Confocal imaging confirmed
that 5A2-SC8 NPs were able to effectively deliver labeled siRNA
into tumor cells in addition to hepatocytes (Fig. 5C). We next
verified that 5A2-SC8 NPs could enable siRNA-mediated si-
lencing in this cancer model. After tumor development has ini-
tiated (day 26), delivery of a single dose of siFVII i.v. showed
potent silencing of FVII protein using a blood assay and by
quantitative PCR in harvested liver tissues (SI Appendix, Fig. S19
A and B).
We then evaluated the therapeutic benefit of 5A2-SC8–
mediated small-RNA delivery in these chronically ill mice. One of
the most important miRNAs is let-7, a tumor suppressor family
down-regulated in many tumor types (41, 42). Because endoge-
nous let-7g is known to be down-regulated in HB and HCC (40),
we wanted to test whether delivery of a let-7g mimic in this set-
ting could inhibit the development of liver cancer. Let-7g was
encapsulated in 5A2-SC8 NPs and delivered i.v. (1 mg/kg) to
tumor-bearing mice (day 26). Let-7g expression was increased
13-fold in liver tissues 48 h postinjection (Fig. 6A). This ex-
periment confirmed that 5A2-SC8 can deliver miRNA mimics
to cancerous livers.
Finally, we started a therapeutic regimen from day 26 by
weekly administration of 5A2-SC8 NPs containing let-7g mimic
or control mimic (CTR) at 1 mg/kg. At day 50, the mice that
received the let-7g mimic had grossly smaller abdomens and re-
duced tumor burden (Fig. 6B). Let-7g caused reduction of ab-
dominal circumference, quantitative of tumor growth (Fig. 6C).
The effect on tumor growth was confirmed by ex vivo liver im-
aging (Fig. 6D). Delivery of let-7g weekly from 26 to 61 d did not
result in any significant weight change compared with control (SI
Appendix, Fig. S20), and more importantly, the therapy signifi-
cantly extended survival (Fig. 6E). All control mice receiving no
treatment and mice receiving 5A2-SC8 NPs with CTR-mimic
died around 60 d of age. Strikingly, delivery of let-7g using 5A2-
SC8 NPs provided a dramatic survival benefit, with one mouse
living to 100 d. These results show that 5A2-SC8 can balance
high delivery efficacy with low toxicity in chronically ill transgenic
mice to provide a significant therapeutic benefit by effective in-
hibition of liver tumor growth.

Fluorescence imaging confirmed delivery of siRNA into tumor cells.
(A) Gross anatomy and fluorescence imaging of mice bearing MYC-driven
liver tumors (day 41) show that 5A2-SC8 NPs mediate massive siRNA accu-
mulation in the whole cancerous liver, with minor accumulation in the
spleen and kidneys 24 h after i.v. injection (1 mg/kg Cy5.5-siRNA). Tumor
tissues of the liver were collected, embedded, and sectioned for H&E stain-
ing and confocal imaging 24 h after i.v. injection to further confirm delivery
into tumor cells. (B) H&E staining confirms that the livers contain tumors. The
same slides of tumor tissues were scanned using confocal imaging and
captured under three channels: DAPI for nuclei (blue), FITC for phalloidin-
stained actin (green), and Cy5.5 for siRNA (red). (C) Confocal imaging of the
same region shows that 5A2-SC8 can efficiently deliver siRNA into tumor
cells inside of the liver.

Modular degradable dendrimers can deliver a therapeutic let-7g

liver cancer model, resulting in a significant survival benefit. (A) 5A2-SC8 NPs
enable delivery of let-7g to liver tissues of transgenic mice bearing MYC-
driven liver tumors (single injection, 1 mg/kg, day 26 mice, 48 h post-
injection). Let-7g expression was significantly increased, whereas other let-7
family members were unaffected. (B) Mice bearing MYC-driven liver tumors
were given weekly i.v. injections of 1 mg/kg let-7g, starting on day 26 (which
is after initiation of tumor development) until day 61. Mice receiving let-7g
had visibly smaller abdomens. (C) Abdominal circumference was significantly
smaller for treated mice compared with controls. (D) Representative images
of livers from let-7g mimic- and control mimic-injected mice show reduced tu-
mor burden. (E) Weekly delivery of 1 mg/kg let-7g (day 26 to day 61) signifi-
cantly extends survival. All control mice receiving no treatment (n = 9) and mice
receiving 5A2-SC8 NPs (n = 5) containing a control untargeted mimic died
around 60 d after birth. Let-7g mimic-treated and control groups did not exhibit
any unusual weight change (SI Appendix, Fig. S20). Strikingly, delivery of let-7g
inside of 5A2-SC8 NPs provided a pronounced survival benefit.

 Discussion
The development of therapies that balance high potency and low
toxicity is a vexing problem for cancer treatment. It is particularly
challenging in liver cancer, where drug-induced hepatotoxicity
exacerbates the underlying liver disease (12). Here, we generated
a modular dendrimer delivery system for small RNAs that bal-
ances low toxicity and high efficacy by integrating degradability
into dendrimers while simultaneously diversifying cores, pe-
ripheries, and generations to overcome multiple delivery bar-
riers. These carriers can provide high potency in tumors without
causing additional harm to normal tissues, solving a critical issue
in treating aggressive liver cancer.
A number of effective in vivo siRNA carriers for hepatic gene
knockdown in healthy rodents and nonhuman primates have
been reported with a main focus on delivery potency (3, 4, 6, 8,
43). Existing carriers are certainly outstanding for manipulating
in vivo targets but may not be able to satisfy the low toxicity
requirement in late-stage cancerous livers. In 2009, it was
reported that tumor growth was greatly suppressed by delivering
miR-26a using adenoassociated viruses into a less aggressive in-
duction of the transgenic mouse model, igniting a new hope for
liver cancer treatment with miRNA therapeutics (15). In this
work, we explored the critical interplay of nonviral carrier tox-
icity and efficacy in a clinically relevant cancer model.
This study establishes that modular degradable dendrimers are
viable carriers for small-RNA delivery that achieve the goal of
balanced low toxicity and high potency to effectively inhibit the
growth of aggressive liver tumors. Because the therapeutic effi-
cacy stems from a combination of a small RNA (let-7g) with the
carrier’s reduced toxicity, degradable dendrimers are excellent
candidates to deliver a variety of small RNAs in translational
applications in normal and cancerous tissues. For example, this
will allow future manipulation of numerous genes in the liver in a
time- and dose-dependent manner without concern of off-target
material-induced effects. It will also be important to explore
combination therapies involving siRNAs against oncogenes,
miRNA tumor suppressors, and chemotherapeutic drugs to ad-
vance clinical utility. Overall, this work shows that the interface
between chemical design, cancer biology, and the clinical disease
setting must be carefully appreciated to develop the next gen-
eration of oligonucleotide-based cancer therapies.
