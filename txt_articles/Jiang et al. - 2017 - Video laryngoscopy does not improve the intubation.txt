intubation outcomes in emergency and
critical patients – a systematic review and
meta-analysis of randomized controlled
trials

Abstract
Background: There is significant controversy regarding the influence of video laryngoscopy on the intubation
outcomes in emergency and critical patients. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to determine
whether video laryngoscopy could improve the intubation outcomes in emergency and critical patients.
Methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases
from database inception until 15 February 2017. Only randomized controlled trials comparing video and direct
laryngoscopy for tracheal intubation in emergency department, intensive care unit, and prehospital settings were
selected. The primary outcome was the first-attempt success rate. Review Manager 5.3 software was used to perform
the pooled analysis and assess the risk of bias for each eligible study. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used to assess the quality of evidence for all outcomes.
Results: Twelve studies (2583 patients) were included in the review for data extraction. Pooled analysis did not show
an improved first-attempt success rate using video laryngoscopy (relative risk [RR], 0.93; P = 0.28; low-quality evidence).
There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 91%). Subgroup analyses showed that, in the prehospital
setting, video laryngoscopy decreased the first-attempt success rate (RR, 0.57; P < 0.01; high-quality evidence) and
overall success rate (RR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.48–0.69; moderate-quality evidence) by experienced operators, whereas in the
in-hospital setting, no significant difference between two devices was identified for the first-attempt success rate
(RR, 1.06; P = 0.14; moderate-quality evidence), regardless of the experience of the operators or the types of video
laryngoscopes used (P > 0.05), although a slightly higher overall success rate was shown (RR, 1.11; P = 0.03; moderate-
quality evidence). There were no differences between devices for other outcomes (P > 0.05), except for a lower rate of
esophageal intubation (P = 0.01) and a higher rate of Cormack and Lehane grade 1 (P < 0.01) when using video
laryngoscopy.
Conclusions: On the basis of the results of this study, we conclude that, compared with direct laryngoscopy, video
laryngoscopy does not improve intubation outcomes in emergency and critical patients. Prehospital intubation is even
worsened by use of video laryngoscopy when performed by experienced operators.

 Background
Securing the airway with tracheal intubation (TI) is a fun-
damental treatment for emergency and critical care
patients with respiratory dysfunction or decreased airway
protection. Direct laryngoscopy (DL) is the primary
method for TI, but it can be challenging when performed
in emergencies because the patient often is in life-
threatening condition and has the factors that make TI
difficult, such as limited mouth opening, unstable cervical
spine, blood or secretions in the airway, and facial trauma,
and in addition the expertise of available practitioners var-
ies [1, 2]. The first-attempt success rate of urgent TI in
emergency and critical patients is relatively low [2–5], and
unsuccessful or prolonged TI can be life-threatening and
may result in severe complications [6–11].
Video laryngoscopy (VL) is a new device that contains
a miniaturized camera at the blade tip to visualize the
glottis indirectly. This method was developed at the be-
ginning of the 21st century [12]. It has been shown that
VL improves laryngeal visualization compared with DL
[13, 14] and provides some advantages in surgical pa-
tients, especially those with difficult airways [15–19].
The use of VL in emergent and critical situations has
also been tested in several observational studies, which
have shown that VL can lead to better intubation out-
comes [4, 5, 20, 21]. A recent meta-analysis of intensive
care unit (ICU) patients demonstrated that, compared
with DL, VL reduces difficult intubation and increases
the first-attempt success rate [22]. Of the nine studies
included in that meta-analysis, however, only three (n =
157 subjects) were randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
[23–25]. An observational study, whether prospective,
nonrandomized, or retrospective in design, does not
control for the operators’ experience with each device or
for patients’ conditions and thus may bias the determin-
ation of the efficacy of different airway devices.
Recently, the performance of VL and DL in patients
needing emergency TI was compared in several RCTs,
and some of them showed no benefit regarding success
rate or intubation time with VL [24, 26–32]. In view of
this, we performed a systematic review and meta-
analysis
that
included
only
RCTs
comparing
the
performance of VL and DL for emergency TI with
respect to the intubation outcomes and complications.

Methods
Data sources
The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases
were searched from inception of the databases until 15
February 2017. The PubMed search strategy provided in
Additional file 1 was applied to search other electronic
databases.

without
full
text,
the
corresponding author of the study was contacted by
email. The reference lists of all eligible trials and reviews
were screened for additional citations. No language
restriction was imposed.
Study selection
RCTs or quasi-RCTs comparing VL and DL for TI in
emergency
or
critical
care
patients
were
included.
Manikin studies, cadaveric studies, and retrospective or
observational studies were excluded. Participants were
nonsurgical patients needing emergent TI in the in-
hospital or prehospital setting. Patients with suspected
laryngeal trauma or extensive maxillofacial injury requir-
ing an immediate surgical airway, supraglottic airway, or
awake fiberoptic intubation were excluded. The primary
outcome was the first-attempt success rate. The second-
ary outcomes were overall success rate; duration of in-
tubation;
and
complications,
including
esophageal
intubation, aspiration, severe low oxygen saturation, and
in-hospital mortality. The rate of Cormack and Lehane
grade 1 classification was also recorded. The definitions
of the outcomes are shown in Additional file 2: Table S1.
The titles and abstracts were independently screened
by two of the present review’s authors (JJ and DM). After
retrieving the full texts of any potentially relevant
studies, the studies’ eligibility was determined. Any
disagreements between the two review authors were
resolved by discussion with the other authors until a
consensus was obtained. A Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
flow diagram was completed to record the selection
process in sufficient detail [33].
Data extraction and risk of bias assessment
The data were independently extracted by two review
authors (JJ and DM). For continuous data, mean, SD,
and sample size were extracted. Data such as median or
CI that cannot be used directly were converted to SD by
using a formula provided in the Cochrane Handbook
[34]. For dichotomous variables, the number of events
that had occurred and the sample size were extracted.
The corresponding author of the study was contacted if
the data were unavailable.
The risk of bias for each eligible study was independ-
ently assessed by two review authors (JJ and DM) using
the “risk of bias” assessment tool of the Cochrane Hand-
book [34]. If all seven domains were assigned a low risk
of bias, the study was classified as “low risk”; if one or
more domains were assigned to the “unclear risk” of bias
category, the study was classified as “unclear risk”; if one
or more domains were assigned to a high risk of bias,
the study was classified as “high risk” [34]. Furthermore,

 Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) sys-
tem (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision,
indirectness, and publication bias) were used to assess
the quality of the body of evidence associated with all
outcomes [35, 36]. Then we developed a grade evidence
profile table using the GRADE software (www.guideline-
development.org) to rate these outcomes as being of
high, moderate, low, or very low quality. If serious or
very serious deficiencies in these criteria were consid-
ered, the quality of evidence was downgraded by one
or two levels.
Data analysis
The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% CI were
used for continuous data. Relative risk (RR) and 95% CI
were used for dichotomous data. A P value less than
0.05 was considered statistically significant. RevMan 5.3
software (Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK) was
used to perform the pooled analysis for the outcomes
from more than one study. A chi-square test with the I2
statistic was used to quantify heterogeneity. An I2 value
less than 40% was considered as low heterogeneity, and
a fixed-effect model was used; otherwise, a random-
effect model was used. In the presence of statistical het-
erogeneity (I2 ≥ 40%) or an indication of clinical hetero-
geneity, subgroup analysis was planned for the primary
outcomes according to the following possible heteroge-
neous factors: (a) different settings: in-hospital (ICU and
emergency room) and prehospital; (b) operators’ experi-
ence: experienced (certified anesthesiologist, emergency
medical service technician with more than 3 years of
clinical experience, performed > 50 TIs, or according to
the judgment of the study authors) or inexperienced;
and (c) different devices: channeled, Macintosh and
angulated VLs. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to
explore other potential sources of heterogeneity if neces-
sary. Reporting bias was assessed using funnel plots if
the result of the primary outcome was derived from at
least ten trials [37].
Results
Using our search strategy, a total of 1380 papers were
identified. Of them, 1313 were excluded during title and
abstract screening because they were duplicates or
irrelevant to our research question. Sixty-seven studies
were selected for full-text assessment using our inclu-
sion and exclusion criteria. Fifty-two further studies were
removed because of having non-RCT characteristics,
lacking relevant data, including surgical participants,
and/or being duplicates. Authors of three studies were
contacted for their full-text articles to confirm their
eligibility: One [38] proved to be a meeting report that
was part of another included study [24]; one was an ob-
servational study [39]; and another was qualified, but its
full text could not be obtained to do the risk of bias as-
sessment [40]. Thus, all three of these studies were ex-
cluded. One study author was contacted for additional
data [41]. Eventually, 12 studies (n = 2583) were included
in the review for data extraction [23–32, 41, 42]. The
study selection process is shown in Fig. 1.

 remainder were quasi-RCTs; 3 were carried out in the
prehospital setting and 9 in the ICU or emergency de-
partment (in-hospital setting). Most intubations in seven
studies were performed by experienced operators, and
five were performed mostly by inexperienced operators.
The angulated VL (GlideScope; Verathon, Seattle, WA,
USA) was used in six studies, the Macintosh-type VL in
four (C-MAC, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany; or
McGrath MAC, Aircraft Medical, Edinburgh, Scotland),
and the channeled VL in two (Pentax Airway Scope,
Pentax
Lifecare/Hoya,
Tokyo,
Japan;
or
Airtraq,
Prodol Meditec, Las Arenas, Spain). Five in-hospital
studies excluded patients with cardiac arrest, and one
enrolled only patients with cardiac arrest. Rapid se-
quence induction (RSI) with sedatives or narcotics
and neuromuscular blockades (NMBAs) were chosen
for all participants or as appropriate by choice of
physicians in most included studies. Three studies did
not use any NMBAs [24, 26, 29].
The overall risk of bias of the included studies was
relatively low. Eight of them could be classified as
low-risk
studies
and
three
as
high-risk
studies.
Detailed information regarding the risk of bias of the
included studies is shown Fig. 2 and summarized in
Additional file 3: Table S2. A funnel plot obtained
from the primary outcome is shown in Additional file
4: Figure S1. The GRADE system showed that the
quality of most evidence was low or moderate for in-
consistency owing to a moderate or high level of het-
erogeneity. The results of the evidence of outcomes
are listed in Additional file 5: Table S3.
First-attempt success rate
The data on the first-attempt success rate for all 12 in-
cluded studies were available. Pooled analysis showed no
significant difference in the first-attempt success rate
between VL and DL (12 studies; RR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.82–
1.06; n = 2583; P = 0.28; low-quality evidence). There was
significant heterogeneity among studies (P < 0.01; I2 =
91%) (Additional file 6: Figure S2).
Subgroup analysis according to different settings iden-
tified a significant difference for the prehospital setting
(three studies; RR, 0.57; n = 647; P < 0.01; high-quality
evidence) but no significant difference for the in-hospital
setting
(nine
studies;
RR,
1.06;
n = 1936;

performed mostly by experienced operators, and two
kinds of VLs (channeled [26, 41] or angulated [32] VLs)
were used. Given that different settings would introduce
principal heterogeneity and only three studies in the pre-
hospital setting were included, subgroup analyses based
on the experience of operators and different devices
used were performed only in the in-hospital setting. No
significant difference was found when TI was performed
by experienced operators (four studies; RR, 1.03; n =
1108; P = 0.37) or by inexperienced operators (six studies
with seven comparisons; RR, 1.16; n = 924; P = 0.05). No
significant difference was found for intubation with
angulated VLs (GlideScope; five studies with six compar-
isons; RR, 1.16; n = 1016; P = 0.04) or with Macintosh-
type VLs (C-MAC/McGrath MAC; five studies; RR, 1.03;
n = 1016; P = 0.43) (Fig. 3). The study by Silverberg et al.

 [24] had a much higher first-attempt success rate when
using VL than that in other studies, and it was the only
study performed in non-cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(non-CPR) patients without using any NMBAs. Thus, a
sensitivity analysis excluding this study in the in-hospital
setting was conducted. The results were not altered; how-
ever, no evidence of heterogeneity could be found in all
subgroups that originally included this study (I2 < 40%).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis and sys-
tematic review of available RCTs comparing VL and DL
for TI in emergency and critical care patients, including
the quality of evidence. In this analysis, the first-attempt
success rate was used as the primary endpoint because
multiple intubation attempts performed outside the op-
erating room can significantly increase the risk of life-
threatening complications [6, 43, 44]. Furthermore, im-
proving the first-attempt success rate has been regarded
as the main goal of emergency TI [45]. Our results show
that laryngeal visualization was improved by using VL.
This is consistent with findings for surgical patients in
the operating room [12]. However, better visualization
did not translate into an improved first-attempt success
rate or other intubation outcomes or complications,
except for a lower rate of esophageal intubation. Prehos-
pital intubation outcomes were even worsened with
lower first-attempt and overall success rates with VL
when TI was performed by experienced operators.
Evidence derived from surgical patients shows that VL
is associated with better intubation outcomes, especially
for inexperienced operators and patients with difficult
airways [16, 28, 46]. This is because TI in the operating
room is controllable, such as with the common use of
RSI and NMBAs, patients’ fasting state, and favorable
oxygenation, as well as appropriate light or intubation
position. For highly experienced anesthesiologists, it
seems unlikely that a single device will show superiority
unless a difficult airway is encountered [47–51], whereas
for novices who have not yet received long-term DL
training, visualization of the airway on a video screen
can allow their supervisors to directly assist them in
completing an intubation themselves, thus reducing the
number of attempts and improving the safety of airway
management [52]. However, emergent TI is quite an-
other thing. Although TI in the emergency department
or ICU is frequently performed by paramedics or emer-
gency medicine physicians who do not practice TI with
DL on a daily basis [53], and although the patients often
have a higher risk of difficult airways [9, 54], the opera-
tors may not benefit from using VL as novices in the op-
erating room. There are several uncontrollable factors
that may explain this difference. First, critically ill
patients with a poor oxygen reserve capacity are more
subject to hypoxia, which makes it more likely that oper-
ators will turn to alternatives such as DL, a flexible or
rigid bronchoscope, or at least further mask oxygen-
ation. If TI is not completed within the allowed time,
inexperienced operators will be replaced by more experi-
enced operators earlier, making the first-attempt success
rate much lower. Second, secretions or blood in the air-
way might impair laryngeal visualization with VLs [26,
28]. Third, RSI and NMBAs will be chosen with caution
owing to circulation compromise, certain airway prob-
lems, operators’ experience, or accessibility of medicine.
Prehospital intubation is more challenging, owing to
additional risk factors such as ambient light, limited
workspace, special positioning, and chest compression
during CPR [55]. Under chest compression, increased

 contents, resulting in more attempts and longer intub-
ation time with the VL. Prolonged intubation time
and subsequent hypoxemia have been identified as
major
reasons
for
increased
mortality
in
patients
undergoing prehospital intubation [56]. In addition, in
prehospital care, DL is more accessible, and most op-
erators are experienced in using it.
It must be emphasized that performance of VL is dif-
ferent between devices owing to various designs and
shapes [57, 58]. Even a slight design modification may
significantly change the success rate, intubation time,
and use of adjunct maneuvers [59]. Some types of VLs
have their own design-related deficiencies that may
dwarf their results. For example, the A.P. Advance™ VL
(Venner Medical International, St Helier, Jersey, UK),
with a large video screen, shows the plastic part of the
blade tip instead of the relevant airway, contributing to
its poor performance [58]. Studies included in our ana-
lysis used three types of VLs (angulated, Macintosh, or
channeled), including five different devices (GlideScope,
C-MAC, McGrath MAC, Airwayscope, and Airtraq). In
the prehospital setting, two of three included studies
used channeled VL. The channeled VL, with its inte-
grated design, might be more portable in the prehospital
setting, but it is bulkier and may require other team
members to maneuver the tracheal tube [58]. It should
be noted that the poor performance of the VL is due
mainly to the prehospital setting itself rather than to the
devices chosen. We therefore did a related subgroup
analysis only in the in-hospital setting. No difference
was identified between VLs and DLs, regardless of the
devices used. Although an angled blade design was as-
sumed to facilitate laryngeal visualization and thus to
lead to a better intubation outcome, it may afford less
room for tracheal tube insertion and increase stylet use
in patients with a normal airway, resulting in increased
procedural difficulty and prolonged intubation time [25,
60]. In addition, pooling of results from studies evaluat-
ing different VLs may lead to intrinsic inconsistencies.
An especially important issue neglected in the design of
the five included studies comparing the Macintosh-type
VL and DL is that the Macintosh-type VL can provide
the two options of DL and VL in one device. When one
attempt fails, the operators can immediately switch to
another option to successfully complete the TI without
having to make a second attempt [61]. This unique fea-
ture of Macintosh-type VLs is significantly different from
DLs and angulated VLs, which can provide only one op-
tion. Thus, definition of laryngoscopy attempts used in
these studies is desirable for DLs but not for Macintosh-
type VLs [62].
The results of some studies indicate that VLs should
be used with caution in critical patients because of a
prolonged intubation time and subsequent possible
higher incidence of severe life-threatening complications
[23, 25, 30]. Our review shows that incidences of aspir-
ation, severe low oxygen saturation, and in-hospital
deaths did not differ between VLs and DLs. However,
these results remain unreliable owing to the limited
number of participants included. Our review shows a
lower rate of esophageal intubation using VLs than that
in another study [22]. This might be somewhat meaning-
ful because “even a single episode of recognized esopha-
geal intubation is associated with desaturation, increased
risk of aspiration, and cardiac arrest” [63]. Moreover, an
important and promising finding in one of our in-
cluded studies and another observational study is that
the use of a VL has a higher first-attempt success rate
with fewer chest compression interruptions in the
emergency department [29, 64].
Our study included only RCTs and quasi-RCTs. Al-
though blinding was not adopted in most studies, we
judged “no blinding” as low risk because it seems impos-
sible to blind personnel in urgent situations at times. In
the prehospital setting, moreover, there is never time for
allocation concealment, and even randomization using a
common method such as a random number table is im-
practical. Risk assessment of bias for the included stud-
ies showed that 7 of 12 studies could be classified as
low-risk studies. Therefore, in general, this supports the
quality of our study. The funnel plot, with its visually
symmetrical distribution, qualitatively indicates a low
risk of publication bias. Given that the quality of most
evidence was low or moderate owing to a moderate or
high level of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis and sensi-
tivity analysis based on some potential clinical heteroge-
neous factors also were performed in our review.
There are some limitations of our review. First, al-
though subgroup analyses were performed, there were
still other clinical heterogeneities in subgroups, such as
patients having different conditions, use of various in-
tubation strategies, and use of any adjacent tool or man-
euver. Whether patients with predicted difficult airways
were enrolled was another important heterogeneous fac-
tor. However, for emergency or critical care patients, the
traditional predictors of difficult airways, such as thyro-
mental distance, Mallampati score, or neck mobility,
cannot
be
recorded,
because
all
intubations
are
performed so urgently that there is never a chance to
make
predictions
or
subsequent
grouping
before
randomization. One observational study showed that
VLs significantly increased the intubation success rate in
emergency patients with difficult airways [65]. In the ab-
sence of a difficult airway, however, the use of VLs may
even bring some disadvantages [25]. Whether anes-
thetics were used and the choice of medication can also
introduce heterogeneity. RSI with sedatives, narcotics,
and NMBAs has been shown to facilitate TI and

 decrease intubation-related complications in reasonable
circumstances [66, 67]. Because most of the studies included
in our review did not have strict protocols regarding medica-
tion, subgroup analysis according to medications seemed im-
possible. Anyway, the study by Silverberg et al. [24]
demonstrated a much higher first-attempt success rate using
VLs. Sensitivity analysis excluding this study did not alter the
results, but the heterogeneities within the subgroups disap-
peared, indicating that this study may be the main factor
leading to heterogeneity. The effect of the NMBAs on the re-
sult was unclear. It may be the negative influence of alternat-
ing of devices that use different configurations on the
learning curve of operators with the DLs that led to a lower
success rate with DLs. Second, owing to ethical consider-
ations, some patients had to be excluded on enrollment,
such as patients with low oxygen saturation [24], those with
an immobilized cervical spine, and patients with predicted
difficult airways, or those excluded owing to attending physi-
cians’ discretion and unavailability of devices at the time of
eligible patient arrival [25]. It is unclear whether these ex-
cluded patients would benefit from one of the interventions.
Third, the classification of the operators’ qualifications and
the definition of intubation time or overall success rate used
in our analysis were based on previous papers or our own
judgment, and this might somehow be arbitrary.
Conclusions
This review does not reveal any improvements in intub-
ation outcomes with the use of VLs compared with DLs
in emergency and critical care patients, except for a
lower rate of esophageal intubation with VLs. In the pre-
hospital setting, intubation outcomes may be worsened
by the VL when intubation is performed by experienced
operators. Further studies are still needed to determine
whether the VL is beneficial for emergency and critical
care patients with difficult airways, regardless of the op-
erator’s experience, and should be focused more on the
impact of VLs on prognostic outcomes such as severe
complications, length of hospital stay, and mortality.
