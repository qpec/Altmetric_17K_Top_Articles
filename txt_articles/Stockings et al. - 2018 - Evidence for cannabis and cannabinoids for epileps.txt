Review evidence for cannabinoids as adjunctive 
treatments for treatment-resistant epilepsy. Systematic 
search of Medline, embase and PsyciNFO was 
conducted in October 2017. Outcomes were: 50%+ 
seizure reduction, complete seizure freedom; improved 
quality of life (QoL). Tolerability/safety were assessed 
by study withdrawals, adverse events (Aes) and serious 
adverse events (SAes). Analyses were conducted in 
Stata v.15.0. 36 studies were identified: 6 randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs), 30 observational studies. Mean 
age of participants was 16.1 years (range 0.5–55 years). 
Cannabidiol (CBD) 20 mg/kg/day was more effective than 
placebo at reducing seizure frequency by 50%+(relative 
risk (RR) 1.74, 95% Ci 1.24 to 2.43, 2 RCTs, 291 
patients, low Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, 
Development and evaluation (GRADe) rating). The 
number needed to treat for one person using CBD to 
experience 50%+ seizure reduction was 8 (95% Ci 6 to 
17). CBD was more effective than placebo at achieving 
complete seizure freedom (RR 6.17, 95% Ci 1.50 to 
25.32, 3 RCTs, 306 patients, low GRADe rating), and 
improving QoL (RR 1.73, 95% Ci 1.33 to 2.26), however 
increased risk of Aes (RR 1.24, 95% Ci 1.13 to 1.36) and 
SAes (RR 2.55, 95% Ci 1.48 to 4.38). Pooled across 17 
observational studies, 48.5% (95% Ci 39.0% to 58.1%) 
of patients reported 50%+ reductions in seizures; in 14 
observational studies 8.5% (95% Ci 3.8% to 14.5%) 
were seizure-free. Twelve observational studies reported 
improved QoL (55.8%, 95% Ci 40.5 to 70.6); 50.6% 
(95% Ci 31.7 to 69.4) Aes and 2.2% (95% Ci 0 to 7.9) 
SAes. Pharmaceutical-grade CBD as adjuvant treatment 
in paediatric-onset drug-resistant epilepsy may reduce 
seizure frequency. existing RCT evidence is mostly 
in paediatric samples with rare and severe epilepsy 
syndromes; RCTs examining other syndromes and 
cannabinoids are needed.

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) 
defines epilepsy as a disease of the brain,  diag-
nosis of which requires: (a) at least two unpro-
voked seizures occurring >24 
hours apart; (b) one 
unprovoked seizure and a probability for further 
seizures of at least 60%, occurring over the next 10 
years or (c) the diagnosis of an epilepsy syndrome.1 
Between 70% and 80% of patients with new-onset 
epilepsy achieve complete seizure control using 
antiepileptic drugs such as valproate or carbamaz-
epine.2 In 20%–30% 
who are drug-resistant,3 4 
there is great interest in investigating novel agents 
to reduce seizure frequency and severity. For the 
purposes of this review, the ILAE’s definition of 
drug-resistant epilepsy—the failure of adequate 
trials of two tolerated and appropriately chosen 
and used antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) schedules (as 
either monotherapies or in combination) to achieve 
seizure freedom5—is used. For the 30% of patients 
who experience drug-resistant epilepsy, the efficacy 
of alternative and adjunctive therapies is likely to be 
of great interest.
Preclinical studies suggest that naturally occur-
ring cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids) have anti-
convulsant effects which are mediated by the 
endocannabinoid system.6 Cannabidiol (CBD) 
and cannabidivarin have shown antiseizure effects 
in both in vivo and in vitro models. In contrast 
to tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), CBD does not 
produce euphoric or intrusive psychoactive side 
effects when used to treat seizures.7 Cannabinoids 
have been proposed as an adjunctive treatment 
for epilepsy7 and parents of children with epilepsy 
report using CBD products.8–10 There are a number 
of phase III human trials underway of CBD as an 
adjunctive therapy for treatment resistant paedi-
atric and adult epilepsies.11 12
Recently Israel, the Netherlands, Germany and 
Canada have legislated to allow the use of cannabi-
noids for medicinal purposes. In Australia, Federal 
and state legislation that allows doctors to prescribe 
cannabinoids is being implemented. Systematic 
reviews are required to synthesise the evidence 
for individual conditions for which cannabinoids 
may be used to inform clinical practice and patient 
guidance.
This review considers evidence on the safety and 
efficacy of cannabinoids as adjunctive treatments 
for drug-resistant epilepsy. As previous reviews 
noted a lack of controlled studies,13 14 we synthe-
sised evidence from randomised controlled trials 
(RCTs) and observational studies.

data sources and search strategy
To identify individual studies examining cannabinoids to 
treat epilepsy, the electronic databases Medline, Embase and 
PsycINFO, and the clinical trials registries:  
clinicaltrials. 
gov, the 
EU clinical trials register (www. 
clin 
ical 
tria 
lsre 
gister. 
eu) and the 
Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR, 
www. 
anzctr. 
org. 
au) were searched in October 2017 using terms 
shown in box 1 (corresponding subject headings in each data-
base were used where specialised thesauri existed). We addition-
ally searched reference lists of systematic reviews identified as 
relevant. Searches were limited to studies published from 1980 
to 9 October 2017 on human subjects, in any language. The 
Medline search is provided in online supplementary materials 4.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included in the review if they administered plant-
based and pharmaceutical cannabinoids to prevent or treat 
epilepsy and epileptic seizures in participants of any age, with 
any type of epilepsy or seizure. We included all experimental 
and epidemiological study designs including RCTs, non-RCTs, 
quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and 
retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, analytical 
cross-sectional studies, self-report surveys and case reports.
Studies were excluded from the review if they were reviews 
of mechanisms of cannabinoid systems, commentary and review 
articles.
study screening
T
wo reviewers independently examined titles and abstracts in 
the web-based systematic review program, Covidence.15 Rele-
vant articles were obtained in full, and assessed for inclusion 
independently by two reviewers. Inter-reviewer disagreement on 
inclusion was discussed with an aim to reach consensus. A third 
reviewer was consulted when consensus could not be reached by 
the two initial reviewers.
Outcomes
We considered primary and secondary outcomes suggested 
by the International League Against Epilepsy’s Commission 
on Outcome Measurement.16 17 The primary outcome was 
the proportion of patients who experienced a 50% or greater 
reduction in seizure frequency. Secondary outcomes included 
the proportion of patients achieving complete seizure freedom; 
quality of life indicators (including changes in mood, behaviour, 
sleep, attention, speech and cognitive, social and motor skills); 
withdrawal from the study (due to adverse events (AEs) or other 
reasons) and AEs.
Assessment of risk of bias
Methodological quality ratings for risk of bias in RCTs were 
determined using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool.18 
RCTs were judged to have an overall low risk of bias if they 
had six to eight risk domains rated as having a low risk of bias, 
unclear risk if four or more domains were judged as being unclear 
and high risk if three or more domains were judged as being 
high risk. Observational or case study reports were evaluated 
using risk of bias in non-randomised studies - of interventions 
(ROBINS-I) tool for assessing risk of bias in non-randomised 
studies of interventions.19 Overall risk of bias was determined 
by the most serious risk of bias allocated to that study across the 
tool. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion, or 
with the input of a third reviewer.
grading of evidence
An evidence grade was given to each reported study, based on 
the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and 
Evaluation (GRADE) tool.18 Randomised, double-blind place-
bo-controlled trials were considered to be of the highest quality, 
but ratings could be downgraded where there were instances of 
bias or poor design. Single case studies or self-report studies were 
considered to be of very low quality. We additionally conducted 
a GRADE assessment using GRADEPro (https:// 
gradepro. 
org/) 
for each reported pooled estimate to evaluate the risk of bias, 
inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias, 
resulting in an overall GRADE rating for each outcome. GRADE 
assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers 
with disagreements resolved via consensus with a third reviewer.
data extraction
Data were extracted from studies using a standardised data 
extraction tool in Microsoft Office Excel 2016. The data 
extracted from studies included specific details about the inter-
vention, populations, study methods and outcomes of signif-
icance to the review question and specific objectives. Data 
extraction tools were piloted and reviewed by the authors before 
being finalised (see online supplementary materials 5 for fields 
extracted).
During the review, clinical experts reviewed the extracted data 
and gave feedback on the need to define drug-resistant epilepsy, 
distinguishing between paediatric and adult epilepsies and 
distinguishing between AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
Accordingly, we extracted whether studies identified their 
participants as having drug-resistant epilepsies, in line with the 
ILAE definition,5 namely, the failure of two or more tolerated 
and appropriately chosen AEDs, used either in combination 
or as monotherapy, to achieve complete seizure freedom (see 
online supplementary materials 3 for a summary of this defi-
nition). Paediatric epilepsies were defined as those occurring in 
persons between the ages of 0 and 18 years. We also extracted 
concurrent AEDs reported by the participants.
All reported AEs, including SAEs and treatment-related adverse 
events (TSAEs) were included in the review. We extracted AEs as 
being ‘serious’ or ‘treatment-related’ based on authors' report.

Where studies reported multiple points of follow-up data, we 
extracted the longest follow-up within each study.
Analysis
All analyses were conducted using Stata V
.15.0.20 We expected 
high levels of heterogeneity between studies due to differences 
in sociodemographic and clinical profiles, thus all outcomes 
were analysed using DerSimonian and Laird inverse-variance 
random effects meta-analysis.21 For RCTs, the relative risk (RR) 
of participants in the treatment groups achieving study outcomes 
relative to participants in the comparison group were estimated 
using the ‘metan’ command. For observational studies with no 
comparison group, the proportion of participants achieving 
study outcomes were pooled using the prevalence command, 
‘metaprop’ using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transforma-
tion to stabilise variances and prevent exclusion of studies where 
proportions approached 0 or 1.20 22 For dichotomous outcomes 
from RCTs, we calculated numbers needed to treat (NNT) and 
numbers needed to harm (NNH) and their 95% CIs. We used 
pooled estimates of relative effect (ie, RRs) to take into account 
the event rate in control groups.23 NNT was calculated for the 
outcomes 50% or greater reduction in seizures, complete seizure 
freedom and quality of life. NNH was calculated for all-cause 
AEs, SAEs, TSAEs and study withdrawals due to AEs.
Heterogeneity in all pooled estimates was summarised using 
the I2 statistic and was described as being unimportant for values 
between 0% and 30%, moderate for 31%–60%, substantial for 
61%–75% 
and considerable for 76%–100%.18
Where sufficient data were available, we conducted subgroup 
analyses on the basis of epilepsy type (such as Dravet or 
Lennox-Gastaut syndromes); sample age (paediatric vs adult or 
mixed aged samples) and overall risk of bias rating.
rEsulTs
Searches identified 445 articles (see figure 1). An additional 11 
poster abstracts were sourced through the American Epilepsy 
Society conference database24 and the authors were contacted for 
further details. Three additional papers were published and iden-
tified through hand-search by the authors after the initial data-
base search, and eight papers were identified via hand-searches 
of systematic review reference lists. After title and abstract 
screening, 91 articles were selected for full-text screening. Of 
these, 35 papers (comprising 36 individual studies) met criteria 
for inclusion in the review (table 1 and online supplementary 
materials 6, table A4; see online supplementary materials 9 for 
excluded studies). We additionally identified 10 ongoing studies 
that met inclusion criteria but for which results have not yet been 
published (see online supplementary materials 10).
Of the six randomised trials, four were parallel double-blind 
placebo-controlled trials,25–28 one was a cross-over study29 and 
one was a randomised placebo-controlled trial with limited 
details of blinding.30 Of the 30 observational studies, 6 were 
open-label intervention trials,11 12 31–34 10 were case studies,35–44 
8 were self-report surveys,8 9 45–50 5 were retrospective chart 
reviews44 51–54 and the design of the remaining study was 
unclear.55

Characteristics of study participants
The RCTs included a total of 555 patients (range: 12–225), all of 
whom had drug-resistant epilepsy. The mean age of participants, 
where reported, was 16.3 years (range: 2.3–49) and the mean 
percentage of males was approximately 48.3% (range: 26.7%–
52%). T
wo RCTs27 28 examined Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, one26 
examined Dravet syndrome and the remaining studies25 29 30 
reported on ‘mixed’ epilepsy syndromes.
In comparison, the non-RCT studies included 2865 patients 
with drug-resistant epilepsy (range: 1–976), whom had a mean 
age of 15 years (range: 0.5–50). The percentage of males was 
approximately 48.6% (range: 0%–100%). Nine of the non-RCT 
studies examined Dravet syndrome either primarily or as a 
subgroup within a larger sample,9 32 35 39 44 46 49 52 53 eight exam-
ined Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,9 32 35 41 46 49 52 53 four studies

ined mixed epilepsy syndromes8 9 11 12 31–35 37 38 40 42–54 and two 
studies36 55 did not specify epilepsy subtype.
Cannabinoids used and features of treatment
The RCTs all studied CBD with a placebo comparator; CBD was 
an adjuvant treatment in all cases. The more recent studies that 
describe data based on participant weight26–28 reported a CBD 
range of 2.5–20 
mg/kg/day across a mean treatment length of 
14 weeks. Earlier RCTs25 29 30 reported using 100 
mg of CBD 
administered 2–3 times per day for a treatment period between 
8 and 26 weeks.
Cannabinoids used in the non-RCT studies varied, but CBD 
was most commonly used (n=159 11 12 31–35 37 41 43 45 46 49 52); 
four studies examined a combined CBD:THC extract39 44 54; six 
examined cannabis sativa8 36 40 47 48 50; one examined dronab-
inol38 and the remaining studies reported various other canna-
binoid formulations. Cannabinoids were used as an adjuvant 
therapy, with a treatment range between 10 days and 7.5 years.
risk of bias
Table 1 and online supplementary materials 6, table A4 include 
the quality assessment ratings for each of the included studies 
(see also online supplementary materials 6, figures A1 and A2). 
Of the six RCTs included in the review, only one was judged 
to be at a low risk of bias,26 one study was judged to be high25 
and the remaining four were judged to have an unclear risk of 
bias27–30 (see online  supplementary materials 6, figures A1 and 
A2), primarily due to lack of detail.
Non-randomised trials were mostly judged to be at serious to 
critical risk of bias, particularly those with self-reported outcomes 
on self-selected participant samples (see online supplementary 
materials 6, figure A3). The lack of randomisation, blinding and 
control groups in these studies mean that their results can at 
most be indicators of clinical experience rather than evidence 
for the effectiveness of the product used. Methodological quality 
for these studies was typically graded as low or very low (see 
online supplementary materials 6, table A4 for full description 
of the studies).
Primary outcome: 50% reduction in seizure frequency
Nineteen studies reported the proportion of participants who 
experienced 50% or greater reductions in seizure frequency. This 
comprised 2 RCTs26 28 and 17 observational studies, including 4 
open-label trials,11 31 34 37 3 retrospective chart studies,44 53 54 3 
self-report studies,45 46 49 3 case reports39 43 44 and 4 studies of a 
general observational design.12 32 52 55
CBD was more likely to produce >50% reduction in seizures 
than placebo in two RCTs (RR 1.74, 95% 
CI 1.24 to 2.43, n=291 
patients, mean age: 25.9 years, range: 10–45 years, I2=0%; low

7.1, figure A4). We estimated that the NNT for one person to 
achieve a 50% reduction in seizures was 8 (95% 
CI 6 to 17). Esti-
mates did not differ based on epilepsy type, sample age or study 
risk of bias rating (see online supplementary material 7.1, figure 
A5–A7). An estimated 48.5% of the 970 patients in 17 observa-
tional studies achieved a 50% or greater reduction in seizures 
(95% 
CI 39.0% to 58.1%, mean age: 8.8 years, range: 6 months 
to 46 years, considerable heterogeneity, I2=79.5%; low GRADE 
rating; see table 2, supplementary material 8.1, figure B1). This 
estimate is comparable to, although larger than the proportion 
of responders in the two larger, high-quality RCTs (42.6%26 
and 44.2%28). Estimates did not differ by epilepsy type, sample 
age or study risk of bias (see online supplementary material 8.1, 
figures B2–B5). The pooled estimate for paediatric only samples 
(57.7%, 95% 
CI 39.0% to 75.6%) was somewhat higher than 
that for adult, or mixed adult and paediatric samples (36.2%, 
95% 
CI 11.3% to 64.4%); however, these estimates fell within 
overlapping bounds of uncertainty (online supplementary mate-
rial 8.1.2a, figure B4).
As noted in table 4, we conclude there is mixed quality 
evidence that there may be some treatment effect of CBD as 
an adjunctive therapy in achieving 50% or greater reduction in 
seizures. There is insufficient evidence from moderate-quality or 
high-quality studies to assess whether there is a treatment effect 
of Cannabis sativa, CBD:THC combinations or oral cannabis 
extracts.
secondary outcome: complete seizure freedom
Seventeen studies reported rates of complete seizure freedom 
among individuals receiving cannabinoids as adjunctive 
treatments (see table 2 for full details). This comprised 3 
RCTs25 26 28 and 14 observational studies, including 4 self-report 
surveys,9 45 46 49 3 open-label trials,11 31 37 2 retrospective chart 
reviews,44 54 2 case studies35 44 and 3 studies of a general obser-
vational design.12 52 55
Of the three RCTs that reported data on complete seizure 
freedom, one study involved only paediatric patients with 
Dravet syndrome (n=120),26 one included both paediatric 
and adult patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (n=171)28 
and one study involved only adult patients with secondary 
generalised epilepsy (n=15),25 all of which were classified as 
drug-resistant. The pooled RR from these studies for CBD in 
achieving complete seizure freedom compared with placebo was 
6.17 (95% CI 1.50 to 25.32, total n=306 participants, mean 
age: 16.4 years, range: 2.3–45.1 no heterogeneity, I2=0%; low 
GRADE rating; see table 2 and online supplementary material 
7.2, figure A8). We estimated that the NNT for one person to 
achieve complete seizure freedom was 171 (95% CI 155 to 339). 
There were no differences identified in the RR of complete 
seizure freedom based on epilepsy type, age group or study 
risk of bias (see online supplementary material 7.2, figures A9–
A11); however, each subgroup only contained one study in these 
analyses.
The pooled prevalence of participants achieving complete 
seizure freedom in the 14 observational studies with no compar-
ison group was 8.5% (95% CI 3.8% to 14.5%, n=944, mean 
age: 8.1, range 6 months to 46 years, substantial heteroge-
neity, I2=77.3%; see online supplementary material 8.2, figure 
B6, low GRADE rating). This was higher than the proportion

Epilepsy
of participants who achieved complete seizure freedom in the 
two larger, high-quality RCTs (namely 4.9% and 5.8%). There 
were no significant differences in the proportion of participants 
achieving complete seizure freedom by epilepsy type, participant 
age or risk of bias (see online supplementary material 8.2, figures 
B7–B10). The pooled estimate for paediatric samples (14.3%, 
95% 
CI 5.2% to 25.9%) was somewhat higher than that for adult 
or mixed adult and paediatric samples (4.3%, 95% 
CI 1.3% to 
8.4%); however, these estimates fell within overlapping bounds 
of uncertainty (see online supplementary material 8.2.2a, figure 
B9).
As noted in table 4, we conclude that there is mixed quality 
evidence that the use of CBD as an adjunctive treatment may 
help achieve seizure freedom. There is insufficient evidence 
to assess whether CBD:THC combinations or oral cannabis 
extracts are effective.
secondary outcome: quality of life
Fourteen studies (comprising 26 individual data points) eval-
uated the effects of cannabinoids on quality of life indicators. 
T
wo were RCTs,26 28 and 12 were observational studies, of 
which 4 were retrospective chart reviews,51–54 4 were case study 
reports,35 39 41 43 2 were self-report surveys48 49 and 2 were open-
label trials.12 32 Quality of life in the two RCTs26 28 was measured 
by parent's/caregiver’s global impression of change. Non-RCTs 
reported improvements in mood, social skills, cognitive skills, 
behaviour, alertness/attention, speech and language, sleep, appe-
tite and motor skills and reductions in self-stimulation.
The pooled RR of parents/caregivers reporting that the 
patients’ overall condition had improved (using the patient 
global impression of change measure) in those receiving CBD 
versus placebo of 1.73 (95% 
CI 1.33 to 2.26, n=274 patients, 
mean age: 12.6 years, range 2.3–45.1, no heterogeneity, I2=0%; 
see table 2, online supplementary material 7.3, figure A12), and 
this did not differ on the basis of epilepsy type, sample age or 
study risk of bias (online supplementary material 7.3, figures 
A13–A15). The NNT for one person receiving CBD to experi-
ence an improvement in parental-reported quality of life was 5 
(95% CI 4 to 9).
A pooled estimate from observational studies of the propor-
tion of patients with improved quality of life when using canna-
binoids was 55.8% (95% CI 40.5 to 70.6, n=440 patients, mean 
age: 12.7 years, range: 6 months to 50 years, considerable hetero-
geneity, I2=93.9; see online supplementary material 8.3, figure 
B11). This included improvements in mood (95.9%, 95% 
CI 
74.1 to 100), cognitive skills (76.1%, 95% 
CI 53.8 to 93.6), 
alertness (54.0%, 95% 
CI 28.3% to 78.9%) and sleep (50.9%, 
95% 
CI 9.8% to 91.4%; see online supplementary figure B11). 
The proportion of participants reporting improvement in quality 
of life indicators was higher in samples with Dravet syndrome 
(100%, 95% 
CI 84.3% to 100%) compared with samples with 
mixed epilepsy syndromes (44.4%, 95% 
CI 29.6% to 59.5%); 
however, the studies comprising the Dravet syndrome subgroup 
were all case series (combined n=5 patients) in which every 
patient responded and thus this should be interpreted with 
great caution (online supplementary material 8.3.1, figure B12). 
Samples comprising adults only reported higher proportions of 
participants experiencing improved appetite, mood and sleep 
(89.3%, 95% 
CI 75.5% to 98.3%) compared with paediatric 
samples (30.1%, 95% 
CI 16.7% to 44.9%; see online supple-
mentary material 8.3.2, figure B13). Studies rated as being at 
‘serious’ risk of bias (the second highest risk rating) had lower 
overall proportions of participants reporting improvement in 
quality of life (16.6%, 95% 
CI 8.4% to 26.3%) compared with 
studies at ‘critical risk’ (the highest rating; 65.2%, 95% 
CI 34.5% 
to 91.3%) and studies where risk was unable to be determined 
due to lack of information (85.4%, 95% 
CI 67.5% to 98.0%; see 
online supplementary material 8.3.3, figure B14).
As noted in table 4, we conclude there is mixed quality 
evidence that CBD improved patient quality of life when used 
as an adjunctive treatment. There was very low-quality and 
low-quality evidence on the use of Cannabis sativa, oral THC, 
CBD:THC combinations and oral cannabis extracts. This was 
insufficient to assess their therapeutic usefulness.
secondary outcome: study withdrawals
Withdrawals are used as an indicator of tolerability and effec-
tiveness of a treatment. T
welve studies reported on patient with-
drawal from treatment—four RCTs25–28 and eight observational 
studies, including two open-label trials,11 41 three retrospective 
chart reviews44 53 54 and three studies of a general observational 
design.12 52 55
In RCTs, there was no difference in the likelihood of study 
withdrawal for any reason between patients given CBD and 
who received placebo (pooled RR 2.96, 95% 
CI 0.64 to 13.78, 
n=306 patients; mean age: 16.4 years, range: 2.3–49, moderate 
heterogeneity, I2=52.2%; see table 3, online supplementary 
material 7.4, figure A16). This did not differ on the basis of 
epilepsy type, sample age or study risk of bias (see online  supple-
mentary material 7.4, figure A17–A19). Based on two RCTs,26 27 
patients receiving CBD were more likely to withdraw from the 
study due to experiencing AEs (pooled RR 4.87; 95% 
CI 1.10 to 
21.68, n=345, mean age: 11.9, range: 2–55 years, no hetero-
geneity, I2=0%; see online supplementary material 7.4.4, figure 
A20), with no difference based on epilepsy type, sample age or 
study risk of bias (see online supplementary material 7.4, figures 
21–23). The NNH for one person to withdraw from CBD treat-
ment due to AEs was 164 (95% CI 140 to 267).
A pooled estimate of the proportion of participants with-
drawing from the study for any reason in four11 52 53 55 
non-RCTs was 28.0% (95% 
CI 5.2% to 59.5%, n=486, mean 
age: 8.7, range: 6 months to 32 years, considerable heteroge-
neity I2=98.0%; see table 3, online supplementary material 8.4, 
figure B15). All samples comprised a mix of epilepsy subtypes 
(see online supplementary figure B16). Pooled estimates of with-
drawal were higher for paediatric-only samples (47.9%; 95% 
CI 
40.9% to 55.0%) compared with mixed paediatric and adult 
samples (15.2%; 95% 
CI 11.3% to 19.6%; see online supple-
mentary material 8.4.1, figure B17). One study rated as crit-
ical risk of bias (the highest risk category)53 had substantially 
higher proportions of participants reporting study withdrawal 
(70.6%, 95% 
CI 61.9% to 78.0%) than studies of lesser risk 
(see online supplementary material 8.4.2, figure B18). The 
pooled estimate for withdrawals from the study due to AEs in 
six studies11 12 41 53–55 was 4.1% (95% CI 0.9% to 8.8%, substan-
tial heterogeneity, I2=72.3%, n=521, mean age: 10, range: 6 
months to 32 years; see online supplementary material 8.4.3, 
figure B19), and did not differ based on epilepsy type, sample 
age or study risk of bias (see online supplementary material 8.4, 
figures B20–B22).
Study withdrawals were noted for patients receiving CBD and 
oral cannabis extracts (table 3). There is mixed quality evidence, 
including from two higher-quality RCTs that patients who 
received CBD were more likely to withdraw from treatment. 
There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about 
withdrawals from oral cannabis extract treatment.

Secondary outcome: AEs
Sixteen studies reported AEs, 4 were RCTs25–28 and 12 were 
non-RCTs,11 12 31 32 35 45 48 49 51–54 including 3 self-report 
surveys,45 48 49 3 retrospective chart reviews,51 53 54 2 open-label 
trials,11 31 1 case study35 and 3 were a general observational 
design.12 32 52
A meta-analysis of 516 patients in three RCTs26–28 found that 
patients who received CBD had a small but significant increase 
in the risk of experiencing any AE compared with those who 
received placebo (pooled RR 1.24, 95% 
CI 1.13 to 1.36, mean 
age: 13.7, range: 2–55 years, no heterogeneity, I2=0%; see 
table 3, online supplementary material 7.5, figure A24), with 
no difference based on epilepsy type, sample age or study risk 
of bias (see online supplementary material 7.5, figures A25–
A27). Specific AEs for which participants receiving CBD were 
at increased risk included drowsiness (RR 2.53, 95% 
CI 1.40 to 
4.57), diarrhoea (RR 2.63, 95% 
CI 1.45 to 4.76), fatigue (RR 
5.80, 95% 
CI 1.36 to 24.83) and changes in appetite (RR 5.46, 
95% 
CI 2.18 to 13.69; see  online supplementary material 7.5.4, 
figure A28). The NNH for one person receiving CBD to experi-
ence any AE was 3 (95% 
CI 3 to 6).
Pooled estimates of 651 patients in 12 non-RCTs were that 
50.6% of patients experienced any AE (95% 
CI 31.7% to 
69.4%, mean age: 12.6, range: 6 months to 50 years, consider-
able heterogeneity, I2=94.4%; see online supplementary mate-
rial 8.5, figure B23). This did not differ based on epilepsy type. 
Mixed paediatric and adult samples had significantly higher 
proportions of participants reporting any AE (82.8%, 95% 
CI 
75.6% to 89.1%) compared with adult-only and paediatric-only 
studies (see online supplementary material 8.5.2, figure B25), 
and studies at critical risk of bias (the highest risk level) had 
significantly smaller proportions (27.0%, 95% 
CI 14.2% to 
41.9%) than studies at lesser risk (see online supplementary 
material 8.5.3, figure B26). The most common specific AEs 
included drowsiness (22.6%, 95% 
CI 15.3% to 30.7%), ataxia 
(17.1%, 95% 
CI 1.1% to 41.7%) and diarrhoea (11.3%, 95% 
CI 
2.8% to 23.0%; see online supplementary material 8.5.4, figure 
B27).
Three RCTs26–28 found that patients in the CBD treatment 
groups were more likely to experience any SAE event than 
patients in placebo conditions (pooled RR 2.55, 95% 
CI 1.48 
to 4.38, n=516, mean age: 14.3, range: 2–55, no heteroge-
neity I2=0.4%, 
low GRADE rating; see online supplementary 
material 7.6, figure A29), with no difference based on epilepsy 
type, sample age or study risk of bias (see online supplementary 
material 7.6, figures A30–A32). Specific SAEs recorded included 
status epilepticus and elevated aminotransferase levels (see 
online supplementary material 7.6.4, figure A33) The NNH for 
one person using CBD to experience any SAE was calculated to 
be 23 (95% 
CI 18 to 40).
Patients receiving CBD also had increased odds of experi-
encing TSAEs (RR 5.93, 95% 
CI 1.38 to 25.46, n=396, mean 
age: 15.8, range: 2–55 years, no heterogeneity, I2=0%, low 
GRADE rating; see online supplementary material 7.6.6, figure 
A34), with no difference based on epilepsy type, sample age or 
study risk of bias. The NNH for one person to experience a 
TSAE was 191 (95% 
CI 167 to 529).
In the five non-RCT studies12 32 33 45 52 with 201 patients, the 
pooled estimate of patients experiencing any SAE were 2.2% 
(95% CI 0% to 7.9%, mean age: 9.1 years, range: 6 months 
to 31 years, moderate heterogeneity, I2=52.5%, low GRADE 
rating) (see online supplementary material 8.6, figure B28). The 
percentage of participants experiencing SAEs did not differ by 
epilepsy type or sample age; however, studies at critical risk of 
bias (the highest risk level) had lower rates of SAEs than studies 
at lesser risk (see online supplementary material 8.6, figure B29–
B31). SAEs included pneumonia and thrombophlebitis; however, 
these were reported in only one study33 (see online supplemen-
tary material 8.6.4, figure B32). Only one observational study 
reported TSAEs,11 with 1.1% (95% CI 0.6% to 1.8%) of partic-
ipants reporting this outcome (n=162, mean age: 10.5, range: 
0.9 to 2.62 years, unimportant heterogeneity, I2=22.5%, very 
low GRADE rating). Specific TSAEs included status epilepticus, 
convulsion, hepatoxicity, pneumonia and death in one case 
(see online supplementary material 8.6.5, figure B33).
There is mixed quality evidence, including from three moder-
ate-quality to high-quality RCTs, that patients receiving CBD are 
more likely to experience mild-to-moderate AEs (see table 4). 
There is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions on 
whether patients receiving Cannabis sativa, oral THC and oral 
cannabis extracts were more likely to experience AEs.
Discussion
We synthesised available evidence on the safety and efficacy of 
cannabinoids as an adjunctive treatment to conventional AEDs 
in treating drug-resistant epilepsy. In many cases, there was qual-
itative evidence that cannabinoids reduced seizure frequency in 
some patients, improved other aspects of the patients’ quality 
of life and were generally well tolerated with mild-to-moderate 
AEs. We can be much more confident about this statement in the 
case of children than adults, because the recent, larger, well-con-
ducted RCTs were performed in children and adolescents.
In studies where there was greater experimental control over 
the type and dosage of cannabinoid used, there was evidence that 
adjuvant use of CBD reduced the frequency of seizures, partic-
ularly in treatment-resistant children and adolescents, and that 
patients were more likely to achieve complete seizure freedom. 
There was a suggestion that the benefits of adding CBD may be 
greater when patients were also using clobazam.11 12 However 
because clobazam and CBD are both metabolised in the cyto-
chrome P450 pathway, the pharmacokinetic interactions of these 
two drugs still need to be fully determined.56 Further randomised, 
double-blind studies with a placebo or active control are needed 
to strengthen this conclusion.
Non-RCT evidence was consistent with RCT evidence that 
suggested cannabinoids may reduce the frequency of seizures. In 
most of these studies, cannabinoid products and dosages were 
less well-controlled, and outcomes were based on self-report 
(often by parents). These studies provide lower quality evidence 
compared with RCTs due to the potential for selection bias in the 
study populations, and other weaknesses in study design. There 
was also some evidence that studies at very high risk of bias had 
higher reported proportions of participants reporting reductions 
in seizures and lower proportions reporting AEs. In RCTs, and 
most of the non-RCTs, cannabinoids were used as an adjunctive 
therapy rather than as a standalone intervention, so at present 
there is little evidence to support any recommendation that 
cannabinoids can be recommended as a replacement for current 
standard AEDs.
limitations
There are still few well-controlled, randomised and place-
bo-controlled studies on CBD in drug-resistant epilepsy.57 Most 
studies in this review were observational and used self-report 
data, raising concerns about possible patient selection and 
self-reporting bias. This concern especially applies to self-report

surveys of parents, most of whom were self-selected and so may 
only include the most satisfied users of cannabinoids. They are 
unlikely to have included patients who had negative experiences 
or received no benefits from using cannabinoids.
The fact that more patients withdrew or experienced AEs 
when receiving CBD than placebo indicates the need for clini-
cians and patients to weigh the risks and benefits of adding CBD 
to other AED treatment. The most commonly experienced AEs 
in patients receiving CBD (drowsiness and dizziness) are similar 
to those reported from approved AEDs such as gabapentin and 
levetiracetam, and occur at similar rates.58 59
Small numbers of patients (8%–12%) in two RCTs experi-
enced TSAEs.26 28 Studies are needed to assess whether the rate 
of these SAEs is similar to that experienced by patients receiving 
approved AEDs. Incidence rates of SAEs with clobazam, a 
common epilepsy treatment60 61 are similar to the profiles of 
cannabinoid SAEs. If cannabinoids are more effective when 
combined with clobazam,11 the possibility of increased rates of 
SAEs will need to be considered.
Safety issues need to be highlighted when discussing the 
results of poorly controlled studies of cannabinoids in epilepsy. 
In clinical trials and non-experimental clinical studies, doctors 
and other healthcare professionals can monitor patients and 
intervene if they experience AEs. When patients use ‘artisanal’ 
cannabis products, there is much less control over dosages and 
purity of the product, and so more variability in dosing. For 
example, in one study, dosages of CBD reported by parents 
ranged from 0.5 to 28.6 
mg/kg/day, and THC dosages ranged 
from 0 to 0.8 
mg/kg/day.49 Well-controlled and well-regulated 
therapeutic trials are essential to specify the doses required to 
produce therapeutic effects with a minimum of AEs. We iden-
tified an additional 10 studies that met inclusion criteria but 
for which results were not yet posted. As these results become 
available, we hope to see these included in updated reviews13 in 
order to improve recommendations on the use of cannabinoids 
for treatment-resistant epilepsy.
Conclusions
Few high-quality RCTs have been conducted to date, and those 
that currently exist have tested CBD in paediatric samples with 
rare and serious forms of drug-resistant epilepsy. Of these existing 
studies, a reasonable proportion of patients experienced a decrease 
in seizure frequency when using pharmaceutical grade CBD prod-
ucts in addition to AEDs; however, minor AEs were likely and 
complete seizure freedom was unlikely. The timely completion 
and publication of RCTs will provide a better basis for assessing 
the benefits and risks of cannabinoid products to control epilepsy.
