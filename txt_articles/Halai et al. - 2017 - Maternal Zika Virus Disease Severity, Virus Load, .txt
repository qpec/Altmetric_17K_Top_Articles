Background. Congenital Zika virus (ZIKV) syndrome is a newly identified condition resulting from infection during preg-
nancy. We analyzed outcome data from a mother-infant cohort in Rio de Janeiro in order to assess whether clinical severity of 
maternal ZIKV infection was associated with maternal virus load, prior dengue antibodies, or abnormal pregnancy/infant outcomes.
Methods. A clinical severity assessment tool was developed based on duration of fever, severity of rash, multisystem involve-
ment, and duration of symptoms during ZIKV infection. ZIKV-RNA load was quantified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cycles 
in blood/ urine. Dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies were measured at baseline. Adverse outcomes were defined as fetal loss 
or a live infant with grossly abnormal clinical or brain imaging findings. Regression models were used to study potential associations.
Results. 131 ZIKV-PCR positive pregnant women were scored for clinical disease severity, 6 (4.6%) had mild disease, 98 (74.8%) 
had moderate disease, and 27 (20.6%) severe manifestations of ZIKV infection. There were 58 (46.4%) abnormal outcomes with 9 
fetal losses (7.2%) in 125 pregnancies. No associations were found between: disease severity and abnormal outcomes (P = .961; odds 
ratio [OR]: 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.796–1.270); disease severity and viral load (P = .994); viral load and adverse out-
comes (P = .667; OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.922–1.135); or existence of prior dengue antibodies (88% subjects) with severity score, ZIKV-
RNA load or adverse outcomes (P = .667; OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.255–2.397).
Conclusions. Congenital ZIKV syndrome does not appear to be associated with maternal disease severity, ZIKV-RNA load at 
time of infection or existence of prior dengue antibodies.

Zika virus (ZIKV) infection in adults has been described as a 
dengue-like viral illness, characterized by low-grade fever, a 
pruritic macular or maculo-papular rash, headache, conjuncti-
val hyperemia, myalgia and arthralgia, usually lasting between 
5 to 10 days [1–6]. Due to the potential for cross-reactivity with 
other flaviviruses, particularly dengue, it is difficult to confirm 
ZIKV-specific antibodies in readily available serological tests. 
Diagnosis relies on detection of ZIKV by polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR) in serum or urine during the period of acute 
ZIKV infection, which has been estimated in most cases to be 
ranging between 0–14 days in serum and 0–21 days in urine 
[3–7]. In the absence of a reliable and reproducible serological 
test, asymptomatic or mild clinical infection that is presumed 
to occur in 80% of cases [1], cannot be confirmed outside this 
window. Therefore, ZIKV infection is a diagnostic challenge in 
sites where dengue infection is endemic. In addition, despite 
its benign presentation in most adults, ZIKV can be extremely 
pathogenic to the developing fetus. Causality between ZIKV 
infection during pregnancy and fetal neurological abnormali-
ties has been clearly established, and microcephaly appears to 
be only the tip of the iceberg [8–10]. It has not been determined 
whether there is an association between clinical disease due to 
ZIKV infection, virus load or pregnancy, and infant outcomes.
Our team recently published findings from a prospective 
cohort of 345 pregnant women in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where 
microcephaly was observed in 4 of 126 infants born to ZIKV-
PCR positive pregnant women (3.2%) [10]. Overall, our rate of 
abnormal pregnancy outcomes was as high as 46%. Among 126 
infants, 42% had abnormalities consistent with congenital ZIKV 
infection and occurred regardless of the trimester of maternal 
ZIVK infection. Following publication of this high frequency 
of abnormalities, questions arose as to whether symptomatic 
ZIKV infection may more frequently lead to adverse pregnancy 
and infant outcomes. Other studies have reported lower rates

of infant abnormalities when evaluating infants born to women 
with either symptomatic or asymptomatic ZIKV infection [11, 
12]. It also has been hypothesized that infants born to women 
in endemic areas may have a higher rate of abnormalities due 
to the presence of dengue antibody dependent enhancement 
phenomena [13, 14]. For these reasons we performed an anal-
ysis using our ZIKV pregnancy cohort data exploring potential 
associations between clinical severity of maternal ZIKV infec-
tion, virus load at the time of acute infection, presence of den-
gue antibodies, and pregnancy/infant outcomes.
METHODS
This analysis was conducted in a prospective cohort of preg-
nant women with new-onset rash referred to the Acute Febrile 
Illness Branch of the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), 
Rio de Janeiro. The study enrolled 345 pregnant women as of 
September 2015 with 53% testing positive for ZIKV by real 
time PCR on serum and/or urine specimens. The current 
report focuses on 134 ZIKV-PCR positive women enrolled in 
our cohort until May 2016, for whom 125 pregnancy outcomes 
were known by July 31, 2016. Details of recruitment, enroll-
ment, and follow-up of these patients have been previously 
published [10].
Clinical Severity Assessment
The clinical severity scoring criteria was established a priori 
based on literature review and local experience following a con-
sensus meeting among our investigators prior to conducting the 
present analysis. The clinical presentation of disease was scored 
in 4 categories as detailed in Table 1. These included: (1) sever-
ity of rash, (2) duration of fever, (3) multisystem involvement, 
and (4) duration of illness. Each category was given a minimum 
score of 1 for mild and a maximum of 3 for severe. The severity 
of presentation was calculated as a sum of the 4 individual cat-
egories, with a minimum of 4 and maximum of 12. The overall 
clinical severity score was divided into 3 severity grades and cat-
egorized as mild, moderate or severe based on total scores of 4 
or less, 5–8, and 9–12, respectively.
Viral Load Assessment
The Lanciotti real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) 
methodology was used for ZIKV RNA detection [15], with 
results expressed as amplification cycles of PCR or cycle times 
(CT) at which ZIKV RNA was detected. Lower threshold cycles 
indicate a higher RNA burden. As both urine and serum sam-
ples were tested, when both specimens were positive, the lower 
CT-values (i.e., indicative of a higher viral load) were used for 
overall analysis. As it is not certain that RNA loads from differ-
ent body compartments are comparable [7], we also conducted 
subgroup analysis by type of specimen (serum or urine).
Birth Outcomes
Birth outcomes were divided broadly into normal and abnor-
mal based on study findings. Normal outcome was defined as a 
live birth of an infant with no apparent abnormalities on phys-
ical exam and neonatal imaging studies. Abnormal findings 
included pregnancy loss, abnormal infant physical exam, or 
abnormal infant neuro-imaging findings. The outcomes were 
further subdivided into the following groups: (1) normal, (2) 
abnormality on clinical neurological assessment only, (3) struc-
tural or imaging abnormality with or without abnormality on 
clinical exam, and (4) fetal loss.

Statistical Analysis
Medians, interquartile ranges, ranges, and percentages were 
used to describe data. Box plots and bar graphs were used to 
visualize findings. We used logistic and linear regression mod-
els to study associations between clinical severity scores, CT 
values, and pregnancy outcomes. We used maternal age, ges-
tational age at infection, and day of illness at evaluation from 
symptom onset in models to control for confounding. All anal-
ysis was conducted using STATA statistical software (StataCorp, 
LP, College Station, Texas, USA).
RESULTS
Baseline clinical characteristics are detailed in Table 2. Sixteen 
patients were assessed >7 days from the onset of symptoms; 
however, all women were assessed ≤5 days from the onset of 
rash. Among 134 ZIKV-PCR positive pregnant women, 131 
had detailed prenatal data available for symptom scoring. Three 
patients were initially assessed at private facilities, and detailed 
symptom evaluation at time of infection was not available for 
scoring. As seen in Figure 1, based on clinical severity grade 
assessment, 6 patients met criteria for mild clinical disease 
(4.6%), 98 patients met criteria for moderate clinical disease 
(74.8%), and 27 patients met criteria for severe disease (20.6%). 
The range of scores was 4–11; with a median score of 7 and an 
interquartile range (IQR) of 6–8.
For 134 ZIKV-PCR positive pregnant women, 130 PCR 
results were done at our facility with quantitative results avail-
able for analysis. Of these, 31 (24%) were positive specimens in 
both urine and serum, 45 (35%) were positive in urine only, and 
54 (42%) were positive in serum only, for a total of 85 positive 
PCR results in serum and 76 positive results in urine specimens. 
The median number of CT values for serum specimens was 32 
(IQR, 30 to 34; range, 24 to 37). The median number of CT 
values for urine specimens was 30 (IQR, 27 to 33; range, 22 to 
37). As detailed in Figure 2a, for mild severity of clinical pres-
entation, the median ZIKV CT-values in serum or urine was 30 
(IQR, 28–32; range, 28–35); for moderate severity, the median 
CT-values in serum or urine was 31 (IQR, 28–33; range, 22–37) 
and for severe clinical disease presentation, the median number 
of ZIKV-PCR CT-values on serum or urine was 31 (IQR, 28–34; 
range, 24–37). In our linear regression analysis, we found no 
association between clinical severity score and viral RNA load 
expressed as amplification cycles of ZIKV PCR (P = .994) after 
controlling for age, gestational age at infection, and days from 
symptom onset. This relationship remained non-significant 
even on subgroup analysis by specimen type; serum (P = .644) 
and urine (P = .890).
Dengue immunoglobulin G (IgG) serology (Abcam, 
Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA), obtained at the time of 
acute presentation of ZIKV infection was available for 121 of 
134 ZIKV-PCR positive pregnant women; 107 women were 
IgG positive (88.4%). Among 125 women with known preg-
nancy and infant outcomes, dengue IgG was available for 112 
subjects with 98 women (87.5%) having positive IgG results 
and 14 (12.5%) having negative results. For women without 
evidence of previous dengue infection, the median clinical

severity score was 7.5 (range: 4–11; IQR 6–9). For women with 
evidence of previous dengue infection, that is, IgG positive, the 
median clinical severity score was 7 (range: 4–11; IQR 6–8). 
Among dengue IgG positive women, the median CT-value for 
ZIKV detection was 31 (range: 22–37; IQR 28–33). For den-
gue IgG negative subjects, the median CT value was 32 (range: 
26–37; IQR 30–34). There was no statistically significant effect 
of pre-existing dengue antibodies on clinical severity of ZIKV 
infection (P = .166) or ZIKV RNA load by CT values (P = .153) 
in our cohort. Seven of 14 (50%) dengue IgG negative, ZIKV-
PCR positive pregnant women had abnormal birth outcomes, 
and 43 of 98 (43.8%) dengue IgG positive, ZIKV-PCR positive 
pregnant women had abnormal birth outcomes. We detected no 
effect of pre-existing dengue antibodies on abnormal birth out-
comes in ZIKV infected pregnant women (P = .667; OR 0.78; 
95% CI: 0.255–2.397).
In our cohort of 134 ZIKA PCR positive pregnant patients, 
125 birth outcomes were available [10]. Fifty-eight (46.4%) 
pregnancies were found to have abnormal outcomes, including 
9 fetal losses (7.2%). In sum, 117 live birth infants occurred in 
116 women (one set of twins). Forty-nine infants (42%) were 
found to have abnormal outcomes. These outcomes have been 
previously described [10]. Thirty-seven (29.4%) ZIKV-exposed 
infants had structural or imaging abnormalities, and an add-
itional 12 babies (9.5%) had abnormal clinical neurological 
assessments in the first months of life. As detailed in Figure 2b, 
pregnancy and infant outcomes observed in our cohort were 
not associated with maternal viral load as measured by CT val-
ues. (P = .666; OR 1.02; 95% CI: 0.922–1.135). This remained 
nonsignificant when viral PCR was stratified according to type 
of specimen (serum or urine). In addition, as seen in Figure 3, 
an association between clinical presentation severity score and 
probability of an abnormal outcome (including fetal demise or 
structural, clinical, or imaging abnormalities confirmed after 
birth) was not demonstrated in our analysis (P = .961; OR 1.00 
95% CI: 0.796 –1.270). This association remained statistically 
nonsignificant even after outcomes were subdivided into fetal 
loss, structural/imaging abnormality with or without clinical 
neurological impairment and abnormality by clinical neurolog-
ical assessment only (Table 3).
As seen in Table 4, the only parameter found to have an asso-
ciation with pregnancy outcomes in the multivariable analysis 
was gestational age at infection. There was a protective effect of 
infection in later gestational time points (P = .042, OR 0.95, 95% 
CI: 0.911–0.998). The odds of an abnormal pregnancy outcome 
decreased by 5% for every additional week of gestation prior to 
infection.
DISCUSSSION
We are only beginning to understand the pathogenesis and 
impact of ZIKV infection in pregnancy. Although most stud-
ies have shown the greatest risk in first trimester infection, 
adverse outcomes including fetal loss have been reported across 
all trimesters [9, 10, 16, 17]. Pregnancy is considered to be an

immune-altered state as the immune system of the pregnant 
woman adapts to tolerate the foreign fetus [18–20]. Due to the 
immunological changes in pregnancy, other infections have 
more severe manifestations during gestation, as is the case of 
measles, influenza, coccidiodomycosis, or hepatitis E. To what 
extent the altered immune status due to pregnancy impacts the 
clinical presentation and pathogenicity of ZIKV is unknown at 
this time.
For many acute infections in immunocompetent adults, one 
expects the severity of signs and symptoms to correspond to 
the level of bacteria, toxins, or virus circulating in the body. 
However, no correlation was found between clinical disease 
severity and ZIKV-RNA load detected by PCR in our cohort 
of ZIKV-infected pregnant women. Studies on HIV, hepatitis 
B and C in pregnancy have shown a greater risk of in utero 
transmission to the fetus at higher viral loads [21–23]. This is 
an important consideration when planning treatment and pre-
vention of mother to child transmission of these infections. In 
our analysis, we did not observe increased risk of congenital 
ZIKV syndrome in infants whose mothers had higher RNA 
loads in either serum or urine. It is possible that, like Parvovirus 
infection, viremia and infectivity is maximal before the onset 
of rash [24] and because all of our patients were referred after 
the onset of a rash, the peak viral load could not be detected. 
However, 88% of the specimens were collected within a week 
of any reported symptom, and even if the PCR cycle times do 
not represent maximum viral load, they represent magnitude of 
viremia/viruria at approximately the same time from symptom 
onset. Thus, differential assessment can still be undertaken with 
regard to correlation with clinical presentation or pregnancy 
outcomes. As longitudinal assessments to demonstrate dura-
tion of viral shedding were not performed, an association with 
duration of viremia cannot be ruled out.
The nucleic assay used to determine virus load in our stud-
ies was the Lanciotti methodology [15]. This is a real-time PCR 
method used consistently in multiple settings since the ZIKV 
epidemic in the French Polynesia and in the Americas subse-
quently. This virus load assay was used in Brazil for identifi-
cation of cases during the Zika epidemic at the national level 
[25, 26]. It was also the assay used in our prospective cohort 
studies of mother-infant pairs with ZIKV infection [10]. Novel 
PCR methods for Zika have used it as the reference method/
gold standard against which novel nucleic acid tests are tested 
[27]. As future quantitative nucleic acid techniques are devel-
oped, it is important to evaluate viral load in serial specimens at 
low copy levels to ascertain the role of magnitude and duration 
of viremia in pathogenesis.
We found that severity of maternal clinical findings during 
primary infection was not associated with congenital ZIKV 
manifestations. In our ZIKV series, abnormal pregnancy 
and infant outcomes had a relatively even distribution across 
patients with mild, moderate and severe clinical manifestations. 
The lack of association of maternal symptoms with birth out-
comes is perhaps not surprising. Other congenital infections, 
such as maternal rubella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), toxoplas-
mosis, and syphilis may be clinically unapparent and still cause 
devastating fetal outcomes.
As rash was an inclusion criterion for subject identifica-
tion in our study, we had a very small number of patients 
with mild disease and none with asymptomatic illness, which 
skewed our severity scores toward moderate to severe man-
ifestations. Even so, our findings substantiate the hypothe-
sis that severity of illness and maternal virus load are not 
predictive of congenital infection, with fetal abnormal out-
comes following asymptomatic disease being very likely. 
These findings are consistent with a preliminary publication 
from Colombia that reported cases of ZIKV infection in 
pregnancy and microcephaly from the National Reporting 
System data [28]. The authors investigated all cases of 
microcephaly and found 4 infants with evidence of congen-
ital ZIKV infection that were born to pregnant women with 
no history of illness in pregnancy. A recent publication by 
Honein et al. that described outcomes from 442 pregnant 
women with laboratory evidence of recent ZIKV infection 
enrolled in the US ZIKV Pregnancy Registry also showed 
similar data. The authors reported 6% infants or fetuses 
with birth defects, with an equal proportion of birth defects

following symptomatic or asymptomatic maternal ZIKV 
infection [29]. Our report provides additional evidence that 
clinical ZIKV infection symptoms may not correlate with the 
risk of fetal transmission and do not appear to correlate with 
abnormal birth outcomes.
We found that gestational age at time of infection is a risk fac-
tor for abnormal outcomes in ZIKV-infected pregnant women, 
albeit the association was borderline significant. This is con-
cordant with our prior analysis of outcomes in this cohort of 
patients, where 55% of infections in the first trimester resulted 
in abnormal outcomes, followed by 51% of second trimester 
infections with abnormal outcomes, and 29% of third trimester 
infections resulting in abnormal outcomes [10].
Although experimental studies suggest that dengue virus 
antibodies may enhance ZIKV infection in vitro and hypothet-
ically increase disease severity [13, 14], in our cohort analysis, 
previous dengue infection was not associated with a higher 
maternal virus load, neither with disease severity nor abnor-
mal birth outcomes. Conversely, prior dengue antibodies were 
also not associated with any protective effect against adverse 
infant outcomes. Although our sample size was limited (only 
12% of women had no prior IgG antibodies to dengue), this 
is an important area of investigation, as it suggests that imple-
mentation of dengue immunization programs may likely not 
adversely affect ZIKV virus pregnancy outcomes.
Our finding of a lack of correlation between maternal clini-
cal symptoms and adverse birth outcomes has significant public 
health implications with regards to antenatal screening prac-
tices for ZIKV infection in asymptomatic pregnant women, 
particularly in areas where the ZIKV epidemic is ongoing. The 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently 
recommend testing pregnant women in areas of active ZIKV 
transmission with immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in the 
first and second trimester and, if positive at anytime, to con-
firm by screening urine and serum specimens by PCR [30]. 
Interpretation of currently available serological tests is com-
plex in areas of dengue endemicity due to the cross reactivity 
between ZIKV and dengue antibodies. In our cohort, 88% of 
women, including ZIKV-PCR negative pregnant women, had 
preexisting dengue antibodies and may have screened positive 
on IgM testing. Additionally, testing by PCR on serum and 
urine once in each trimester may miss the period of viremia 
and/or viruria. A new diagnostic strategy is needed to identify 
asymptomatic or mild clinical ZIKV infection in pregnancy.
Limitations to our study include the fact that only patients 
with a rash were enrolled, as that was an inclusion criterion. 
Therefore, we cannot extrapolate data to patients who were 
asymptomatic. ZIKV load was not measured in sequential spec-
imens, so the time point of greater viremia or viruria could be 
missed. For this reason associations with duration of viral shed-
ding could not be evaluated. Absence of prior dengue infection 
was limited to 12% of women without serologic evidence of 
dengue, a common problem in endemic areas.
Thus, in conclusion, research efforts for the prevention of 
perinatal transmission of ZIKV should not be focused on symp-
tomatic patients only. Our finding of no correlation between 
severity of symptoms in antenatal ZIKV infection and birth 
outcomes supports the observation that there is risk of con-
genital ZIKV infection in the absence of symptomatic disease. 
Development of a reliable, reproducible, sensitive, specific 
and accessible serologic assay is important to assess the risk of 
symptomatic and asymptomatic ZIKV infection in pregnancy.
