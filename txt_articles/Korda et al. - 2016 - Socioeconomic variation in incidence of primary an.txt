Abstract
Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affects disadvantaged people, but reliable
quantitative evidence on socioeconomic variation in CVD incidence in Australia is lacking. This study aimed to
quantify socioeconomic variation in rates of primary and secondary CVD events in mid-age and older Australians.
Methods: Baseline data (2006–2009) from the 45 and Up Study, an Australian cohort involving 267,153 men and
women aged ≥ 45, were linked to hospital and death data (to December 2013). Outcomes comprised first event –
death or hospital admission – for major CVD combined, as well as myocardial infarction and stroke, in those with
and without prior CVD (secondary and primary events, respectively). Cox regression estimated hazard ratios (HRs)
for each outcome in relation to education (and income and area-level disadvantage), separately by age group
(45–64, 65–79, and ≥ 80 years), adjusting for age and sex, and additional sociodemographic factors.
Results: There were 18,207 primary major CVD events over 1,144,845 years of follow-up (15.9/1000 person-years),
and 20,048 secondary events over 260,357 years (77.0/1000 person-years). For both primary and secondary events,
incidence increased with decreasing education, with the absolute difference between education groups largest
for secondary events. Age-sex adjusted hazard ratios were highest in the 45-64 years group: for major CVDs, HR
(no qualifications vs university degree) = 1.62 (95% CI: 1.49–1.77) for primary events, and HR = 1.49 (1.34–1.65) for
secondary events; myocardial infarction HR = 2.31 (1.87–2.85) and HR = 2.57 (1.90–3.47) respectively; stroke HR = 1.48
(1.16–1.87) and HR = 1.97 (1.42–2.74) respectively. Similar but attenuated results were seen in older age groups, and
with income. For area-level disadvantage, CVD gradients were weak and non-significant in older people (> 64 years).
Conclusions: Individual-level data are important for quantifying socioeconomic variation in CVD incidence, which is
shown to be substantial among both those with and without prior CVD. Findings reinforce the opportunity for, and
importance of, primary and secondary prevention and treatment in reducing socioeconomic variation in CVD and
consequently the overall burden of CVD morbidity and mortality in Australia.

 Background
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of
death and disability globally [1, 2]. In Australia, although
CVD mortality has decreased around 70% since the
early 1980s [3], more people die from ischaemic heart
disease than any other disease, followed closely by stroke
[4], and CVD accounts for the greatest health care ex-
penditure of any major disease group [5]. Around one in
five Australians aged 45–74 are estimated to be at high
absolute CVD risk — just over half of these have high pri-
mary risk, and the remainder have a history of prior CVD
and hence are at high risk of a secondary event [6]. Des-
pite this high background level of risk, a large proportion
of CVD events can be prevented using population-
and individual-level interventions and there remains
substantial potential for further reductions in CVD
incidence and mortality.
The potential for CVD prevention is likely to be greatest
in the most disadvantaged groups within the population,
given that the CVD burden is highest in these groups [7].
Nevertheless, there is a lack of reliable quantitative evi-
dence on socioeconomic variation in the incidence of
CVD in Australia. In this country, aggregate CVD hospital
admissions and mortality data are typically used to report
on variation in CVD, with inequalities described in
relation to area-level disadvantage [7–10]. However, these
data do not allow estimation of CVD incidence, and they
will necessarily underestimate socioeconomic variation in
CVD events. In contrast, population-based prospective
cohort studies can quantify variation in incidence by
incorporating individual-level socioeconomic factors and
tracking CVD events (both fatal and non-fatal) in
individuals. Studies of this type undertaken in high-
income countries other than Australia generally report
higher incidence of primary (incident) CVD, usually
myocardial infraction or stroke, among people of lower
socioeconomic position (SEP) [10–29]. However, while
the relationships between SEP and CVD outcomes are
broadly similar across industrialised countries and may be
similar in Australia, local contemporary data are import-
ant for quantifying the magnitude of the problem. This
evidence is critical to prioritising and targeting interven-
tions, and for evaluating progress. We could identify only
two population-based prospective studies using Australian
data. One study of mid-age women found decreasing inci-
dence of self-reported stroke with increasing education,
and a pooled cohort study using linked data (Australia
and New Zealand (NZ) combined), reported increasing
event rates (primary and secondary combined) with
decreasing education for total CVD and coronary heart
disease, but not for stroke [30].
World-wide, there is scant evidence on socioeconomic
variation in incidence of secondary CVD events (i.e. in
those with existing CVD or history of a prior event)
[31]. We could not identify any Australian studies on
this. The distinction between primary (incident) and
secondary events is important given the much larger
absolute risk of a CVD event in those with prior CVD
and hence potentially greater absolute benefits from
intervention. In addition, approaches to prevention and
treatment, and methodological implications, for these out-
come types differ. Quantification of such variation neces-
sarily requires individual-level longitudinal data on both
non-fatal and fatal specific CVD endpoints; information
on prior CVD history; and individual-level rather than
area-based measures of SEP, with studies based on the latter
likely to underestimate variation [32].
The aim of this study was to use large-scale individual-
level linked survey and administrative data to quantify
individual-level socioeconomic variation in rates of pri-
mary and secondary CVD events, in a population-based
cohort of mid-age and older Australians.
Methods
Data
We used data from the Sax Institute’s 45 and Up Study,
an Australian cohort involving 267,153 men and women
aged 45 and over from New South Wales (NSW),
Australia. Participants in the Study were randomly sam-
pled from the database of Australia’s universal health in-
surance provider, Medicare Australia, with over-sampling
by a factor of two, of individuals aged 80 years and over
and people resident in rural areas. Around 10% of the en-
tire NSW population aged 45 and over were included in
the sample. Participants joined the Study by completing a
baseline questionnaire (between Jan 2006 and April 2009)
and giving signed consent for follow-up and linkage of
their information to a range of health databases. The
Study is described in detail elsewhere [33], and question-
naires can be viewed online [34].
Baseline survey data from the participants were linked
to hospital data from the NSW Admitted Patient Data
Collection (APDC, 1 July 2000 to 31 December 2013),
data on date of death from the NSW Registry of Births,
Deaths and Marriages (1 January 2006 to 31 December
2013), and data on causes of death from the Cause of
Death Unit Record File (1 January 2006 to 31 December
2013). The APDC includes records of all hospitalisations
in NSW, dates of admission and discharge and reasons
for admission. Each record in APDC contains up to 51
diagnosis
codes
using
the
International
Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems,
Tenth Revision, Australian Modification (ICD-10-AM)
codes and up to 50 procedure codes using the Australian
Classification of Health Interventions (ACHI) codes.
The Cause of Death Unit Record File includes pri-
mary causes of death and up to 20 additional causes
using ICD-10-AM. Data were linked probabilistically
Korda et al. International Journal for Equity in Health  (2016) 15:189 
Page 2 of 10
 by the Centre for Health Record linkage using personal infor-
mation (including full name, date of birth, sex and address).
Over the relatively short follow-up period, a small but
unknown number of participants are likely to have moved
out of NSW. Although hospitalisations occurring in neigh-
bouring states would not be captured, these are estimated to
make up fewer than 2% of admissions in NSW residents.
Hence, follow-up for hospitalisations is considered to
be ~98% complete among those continuing to reside
in NSW. Quality assurance data on the data linkage
show false positive and negative rates of < 0.5% and < 0.1%,
respectively.
Outcomes
The main outcome was a major CVD event: a composite
endpoint of fatal or non-fatal major CVD, ascertained
through first hospital admission for major CVD, or death
due to CVD, following recruitment into the study. We de-
fined major CVD as a sub-group of circulatory diseases
that have a significant atherosclerotic or arteriovenous
thromboembolic component, based on a combination of
diagnosis codes from ICD-10-AM and CVD-related inter-
vention procedure codes from the 5th to 7th editions of
ACHI [35]. In addition, we separately examined two com-
mon CVD subtypes: myocardial infarction (ICD-10-AM
codes: I21 and I22) and stroke (intracerebral haemorrhage,
infarction or transient ischaemic attack, ICD-10-AM
codes: I61, I63, I64, and G45). In a supplementary analysis
we also report results for ischaemic heart disease com-
bined (ICD-10-AM codes: I20–I25) for comparison with
other published results. We ascertained outcomes using
the primary diagnosis code field (and procedure fields) of
the APDC, and the primary cause of death code field of
the Cause of Death Unit Record File.
In order to distinguish primary from secondary CVD
events, we analysed outcomes separately in those with
and without prior history of CVD. Prior CVD was
defined as self-reported heart disease, stroke, or blood
clot (thrombosis) on the baseline questionnaire, and/or
hospital admission for major CVD ascertained from the
51 diagnosis code fields and the 50 procedure code fields
of APDC in the 6 years prior to entering the study.
For each analysis, participants contributed person-years
from recruitment date to the outcome of interest (first major
CVD/myocardial infarction/stroke/ischaemic heart disease
hospital admission or death), death from any cause, or end
of follow up (31 December 2013), whichever was the earliest.
Main exposure: socioeconomic position
Socioeconomic position was based on education attain-
ment, as well as two supplementary socioeconomic expo-
sures for comparison—annual household income and
area-level disadvantage. Education attainment was used as
the primary socioeconomic variable as it is an individual
as opposed to area-based measure. In addition, unlike
household income, education attainment is a stable
indicator of SEP from relatively early in the life course, is
unlikely to be subject to reverse causality (i.e. CVD out-
comes impacting on SEP), and is considered to be reliably
reported with little missing data.
Education attainment was self-reported in defined cat-
egories, which were grouped for the analysis: No qualifica-
tions
(“no
school
certificate
or
other
qualifications”);
certificate/diploma/trade (“school or intermediate certificate
or equivalent,” “higher school or leaving certificate or
equivalent,” “trade/apprenticeship, e.g. hairdresser, chef,”
“certificate/diploma, e.g., child care, technician”); and univer-
sity degree (“university degree or higher”). Annual house-
hold income (from all sources, before tax) was self-reported
in six defined brackets, which were grouped for analysis:
< $20,000, $20,000- < $40,000, $40,000- < $70,000, ≥ $70,000
and missing. Area-level disadvantage was based on the
Australian Bureau of Statistics Index of Relative Socio-
economic Disadvantage (IRSD), a measure derived from
Census data which summarises socioeconomic disadvan-
tage in a particular area. [36] We categorised the IRSD
into population-based quintiles using 2006 Australian
Census data, and assigned it to individuals using their
postcode of residence.
Analysis
All analyses were conducted separately in those with and
without prior CVD. First, we calculated rates of major CVD
in relation to education, separately in males and females. Rates
were standardised by age to the 2006 NSW population, in 5-
year age groups, using the direct method [37], and rates differ-
ences (RD) and rate ratios (RR) were calculated, comparing
rates in the lowest education group to those in the highest.
Second, Cox regression was used to estimate hazard
ratios (HRs) for each outcome (major CVD/myocardial
infarction/stroke/ischaemic heart disease hospital admis-
sion or death) in relation to education, with age as the
underlying time variable, as a measure of relative differ-
ences in outcomes according to SEP. Analyses were per-
formed separately for three age groups (45–64, 65–79,
and ≥ 80 years). Model 1 was adjusted for age (as the
underlying time variable) and sex. Model 2 was adjusted
for age, sex, region of birth (born in Australia/NZ and
born in other countries) and region of residence (major
cities, inner regional, and outer regional/remote/very
remote). Model 3 was adjusted for the same factors as
Model 2 and additionally adjusted for private health insur-
ance (hospital/Department of Veterans Affairs concession
card and no private health insurance). Participants with
missing values for the main SEP measure were dropped
from that analysis. Missing values for covariates were
included
in
the
models
as
separate
categories.
In
supplementary analyses, we calculated age-adjusted rates
Korda et al. International Journal for Equity in Health  (2016) 15:189 
Page 3 of 10
 and estimated HRs for major CVD in relation to income
and area-based disadvantage (Model 1 only).
Two sets of sensitivity analyses were performed. In the
first, we re-defined prior history of CVD to exclude self-
reported blood clot (thrombosis) and re-ran the analyses
for all outcomes; in the second analyses, we excluded
transient ischaemic attack from the definition of stroke.
The proportional hazards assumption was verified
using tests based on the Schoenfeld residuals for each
model (significance level of 0.0001 was used due to the
large sample size). Stratified forms of the models were
used where covariates showed non-proportionality of
hazards. Tests for linear trend were also performed for
each model. All analyses were performed using Stata
version 12.
Results
After excluding individuals with linkage errors (n = 196)
and those aged less than 45 years at baseline (n = 8), the
sample included 266,684 participants. Mean age was
63 years (Standard deviation (SD) =11), with 61% aged
45–64 years, 28% aged 65–79 years, and 10% aged 80+
years. Just over half of all participants (54%) were fe-
male. Of the total sample, 12% had no qualifications,
65% a certificate, diploma or trade and 23% a university
degree, with education levels higher in the younger than
older cohorts. One in five people (22%) reported a
history of prior CVD, ranging from 12% in those aged
45–64, to 51% in those aged 80 or older. Further sample
characteristics are shown in Table 1.
There were a total of 38,255 major CVD events over
1,405,202
years
of
follow-up
(median
follow-up =
5.37 years), a rate of 27.2 per 1000 person-years. There
were 18,207 primary major CVD events (i.e. events in
people with no prior CVD) over 1,144,845 years, a rate of
15.9 per 1000 person-years, and 20,048 secondary events
(i.e. events in people with prior CVD) over 260,357 years,
a rate of 77.0 per 1000 person-years.
For both primary and secondary major CVD events, age-
standardised rates decreased with increasing education,
among both males and females (Fig. 1). For primary events,
age-standardised rates for males ranged from 18.6 per 1000
person years among those with a university degree to 22.7
per 1000 person years among those with no school
qualifications (RD = 4.07; RR = 1.22), with the correspond-
ing rates in females being 10.4 and 15.3 per 1000 person
years (RD = 4.86; RR = 1.47). Rate differences were notably
higher for secondary events, with age-standardised rates for
males ranging from 59.4 per 1000 person years among
those with a university degree to 86.4 per 1000 person years
among those with no qualifications (RD = 27.0; RR = 1.45);
the corresponding rates in females were 36.0 and 50.9 per
1000 person years (RD = 14.9; RR = 1.41).
After adjusting for age and sex (Model 1), HRs in-
creased with increasing education in each age group for
both primary and secondary events, as indicated by the
tests for trend (Table 2). In the 45–64 years age group,
rates were around 50–60% higher among those with no
qualifications than among those with a university degree,
for both primary (HR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.49–1.77) and
secondary (HR = 1.49; 95% CI: 1.34–1.65) major CVD
events. Additional adjustment for region of birth and
region of residence (Model 2) and also private health
insurance (Model 3) made little difference to the HR
estimates (Additional file 1: Table S1). Similar but
attenuated results were seen in the older age groups
(65–79 and ≥ 80 years) (Table 2).
Analyses conducted for myocardial infarction only,
which accounted for 17% of primary and 16% of
secondary major CVD events, obtained similar pat-
terns to analyses for total major CVD events but HRs
were substantially higher, in all age groups (Table 2).
In the 45–64 years age group, myocardial infarction
rates were around two and half times higher among
those with no qualifications than among those with a
university degree for both primary (HR = 2.31, 95%
CI: 1.87–2.85) and secondary (HR = 2.57; 95% CI:
1.90–3.47) events. Even in the older participants, rates
were around 40% higher in the least compared to
the most educated group (primary event HRs: 1.37,
95% CI: 1.05–1.80; and secondary events: HR = 1.38,
95% CI: 1.13–1.68). Analyses conducted for ischae-
mic heart disease events combined, which accounted
for nearly half of all primary (44%) and secondary
(47%) major CVD events, obtained similar results to
analyses for total major CVD events (Additional file 2:
Table S2).
Patterns for stroke, which accounted for 17% of
both primary and secondary major CVD events, were
also similar to those for all major CVD although
trends were not significant for primary events among
the two older age groups (65–79 and ≥ 80 years,
Table 2). Hazard ratios were again highest in the 45–
64 year age group, with a 50% higher risk of stroke
among those with no qualifications compared to those
with a university degree, for primary events (HR =
1.48,
95%
CI:
1.16–1.87)
and
a
nearly
two-fold
(100%) greater risk for secondary events (HR = 1.97,
95% CI: 1.42–2.74).
Hazard ratios for the two sets of sensitivity analyses —
one excluding self-reported thrombosis from the defin-
ition of prior CVD (resulting in 928 events (2.5%) being
re-classified as primary rather than secondary), and the
other excluding transient ischaemic attack from the
definition of the stroke outcome (resulting in 2289 (36%)
fewer events) — did not differ materially from those for
the main analyses.

 Similar relationships between SEP and major CVD inci-
dence were seen when rates were modelled according to
annual household income, although SEP trends were not
significant in the older age group (≥ 80 years); when area-
level disadvantage was the measure of SEP, gradients were
weak (45–64 years age group) or non-significant (65–79
and ≥ 80 years age groups) (Additional file 3: Figure S1
and Additional file 4: Table S3).
Discussion
Large-scale, individual-level prospective data on mid-age
and older Australians revealed substantial socioeco-
nomic variation in the incidence of both primary and
secondary CVD events, with rates higher among disad-
vantaged people. For both those with and without prior
CVD in age group 45–64, major CVD incidence rates
were
around
50–75%
higher,

 around 250% higher and stroke incidence rates around
50–100% higher, among those of low SEP (no educa-
tional qualifications) compared to those of high SEP
(university degree). Similar but attenuated relative in-
equalities were seen in the two older age groups (65–79
and ≥ 80); however, when using area-level as a proxy for
individual SEP there was no significant socioeconomic
variation in these older age groups. The absolute differ-
ence in rates between socioeconomic groups was consid-
erably larger for secondary than primary events, with
rate differences in overall CVD incidence between the
highest and lowest educational groups for secondary
major CVD events six-fold higher than for primary
major
CVD
events
in
males,
three-fold
higher
in
females.
While it is difficult to directly compare the magnitude
of socioeconomic variation in CVD across studies, that
incidence of primary CVD events increased with in-
creasing disadvantage is consistent with international
evidence. With few exceptions, (e.g., [30]), prospective
cohort studies in high-income countries report higher
incidence of ischaemic heart disease and stroke among
those of lower SEP [10, 11, 13–26, 28, 29, 31, 38–43].
They are also consistent with a recent large prospective
United Kingdom (UK) study, where relative rates of ath-
erosclerotic CVD subtypes, including unstable angina,
ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, myocardial
infarction, heart failure and peripheral arterial disease,
varied inversely with area-level deprivation [43]. Our
findings on socioeconomic variation in stroke incidence
are also consistent with an Australian prospective study
on
incident
stroke
in
mid-age
Australian
women
(1996–2008) using self-reported data [44], and with a
study based on aggregated stroke registry and census
data (1995–2003) [45]. However they differ from a
pooled cohort study using Australian/NZ data, which
found increasing event rates (primary and secondary
combined) with decreasing education for all CVD and
coronary heart disease, but not for stroke [30]. These
differing findings may not only reflect differences
within the Australian and NZ populations but also
different methods (definition of endpoints, consider-
ation of prior CVD history), and given the attenuation
of risks in older age groups, different age structures
across the studies.
To our knowledge, this is the first Australian study to
have quantified variation in incidence of secondary CVD
events and there are few international studies with
which to compare our findings. The magnitude of
income-related relative inequalities in rates of incident
myocardial infarction reported in a Finnish population-
based study were slightly lower than those for incident
and subsequent myocardial infarctions combined [39].
Limited evidence also comes from prospective studies
on stroke recurrence in several European studies. In a
Swedish prospective study (1990–2001), while incident
stroke was associated with lower income and occupation
in both men and women, recurrent stroke was inversely
associated with income only in women [40]; in an Italian
study (2001–2004), among those who had survived a
first stroke, low SEP (measured at the small area level)
was associated with a subsequent admission for stroke
(in men) and cardiovascular disease (in women) [46]; a
UK population-based study (1995–2004) reported no
difference in stroke recurrence between manual and
non-manual
occupations
[47].
Despite
the
lack
of
previous evidence for comparison, the higher absolute
inequalities for secondary compared to primary CVD
events found in this study is consistent with a priori ex-
pectations, given that the absolute risk of a CVD event
is higher amongst those who have had a prior CVD
event than among those who have not.

 That relative inequalities were greater in mid-age
(45–64 years) than older people—across the various
outcomes and the different measures of SEP—is in line with
previous international evidence [15, 16, 23, 25, 39, 48]. This
attenuating RR will occur wherever absolute risk increases
with increasing exposure (as is usually the case with age)
and RDs remain constant (and in some cases even if RDs
rise). This age attenuation in RRs may also reflect the
‘survivor effect’ (whereby the negative effect of low SEP on
health means those remaining in the cohort are not a
random sample of the population but rather reflect those
who are more likely to have survived the effect of low SEP
on premature mortality); change in risk actors with age;
and/or that the selected SEP variables—education, house-
hold income and area-level disadvantage—are less accurate
measures of SEP in older than younger people. That
socioeconomic variation was not apparent in the two
older age groups when area-level was used as the SEP
measure is consistent with the expectation that when
such measures are used as a proxy for individual SEP
there is likely to be considerable misclassification of
individuals, and hence, underestimation of socioeconomic
variation in the outcome. As has been noted previously,
this underestimation is important to take into account
when making decisions based on area-level inequality
estimates [32].
The strengths of our prospective cohort study include:
its large sample size, enabling examination of outcomes
separately in relation to CVD subtypes and by age group;
independent ascertainment of outcomes, including both
fatal and non-fatal endpoints, with virtually complete
follow-up through linkage to administrative hospital and
death records; and availability of individual-level socio-
demographic factors and measures of SEP. However,
there are several limitations that should be borne in
mind when interpreting the results. First, administrative
hospital and death data may not capture all major CVD
events, although they are likely to capture the vast ma-
jority. Second, data on education and income were self-
reported, which means possible misclassification of SEP,
although this is likely to be non-differential and, if any-
thing, bias results towards the null; also we did not
capture changes over time in SEP. Third, while the 45
and Up cohort are broadly representative of the Austra-
lian population in this age group, they are likely to be
healthier and have lower hospitalisation and mortality
rates than the general population in this age group. Fur-
ther, consistent with many population-based cohort
studies, the design aimed to maximise heterogeneity of
exposure and to retain participants rather than provide a
sample that is necessarily representative of the general
population, and thus caution should be used when inter-
preting and generalising absolute incidence estimates.
However, representativeness is not necessary for reliable
estimates of relative rates based on internal comparisons
within study populations [49, 50], and the relative in-
equality estimates, as measured in this study, are as-
sumed to be valid and broadly generalizable, albeit
potentially biased toward the null given the likelihood of
some non-differential misclassification of SEP and out-
come variables. Finally, the study did not set out to attri-
bute causality, hence the minimal adjustment for other
explanatory variables in the models. Consequently, some
caution should be applied when attributing causality. This
caution particularly applies to the findings on variation in
secondary events by income due to the possibility of re-
verse causality (i.e. that a previous CVD event will lead to
a loss of income), especially in the 45–64 age group who
are of working-age.
Implications and conclusions
Individual-level longitudinal data on both fatal and
non-fatal CVD outcomes are important for quantifying
socioeconomic variation in CVD incidence. Based on
individual-level SEP measures, socioeconomic variation
in CVD incidence is shown to be substantial, not just
for primary events, but also for secondary events. Given
CVD is largely preventable and socioeconomic vari-
ation technically avoidable, our findings suggest large
potential for reductions in CVD burden.
While our study did not examine the reasons under-
lying socioeconomic variation in incidence, it is likely to
include variation in behavioural risk factors such as
smoking and physical activity, and also health care. The

 novel finding that the largest socioeconomic differences
are among those who have had a prior CVD event —
and are therefore likely to be in contact with the
health care system — reinforces the opportunity for,
and importance of, optimal treatment and secondary
prevention.
CVD is a national health priority for the Australian
Government. Reducing the socioeconomic variation in
incidence of both primary and secondary events should
be a target in itself, not only to reduce health inequal-
ities, but as a mechanism for lowering the overall burden
of CVD morbidity and mortality in Australia.
