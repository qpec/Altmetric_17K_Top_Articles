Abstract
Introduction: Characterizing smoking history patterns summarizes life course exposure for birth 
cohorts, essential for evaluating the impact of tobacco control on health. Limited attention has 
been given to patterns among African Americans.
Methods: Life course smoking histories of African Americans and whites were estimated begin-
ning with the 1890 birth cohort. Estimates of smoking initiation and cessation probabilities, 
and intensity can be used as a baseline for studying smoking intervention strategies that target 
smoking exposure. US National Health Interview Surveys conducted from 1965 to 2012 yielded 
cross-sectional information on current smoking behavior among African Americans and whites. 
Additional detail for smokers including age at initiation, age at cessation and smoking intensity 
were available in some surveys and these were used to construct smoking histories for par-
ticipants up to the date that they were interviewed. Age-period-cohort models with constrained 
natural splines provided estimates of current, former and never-smoker prevalence in cohorts 
beginning in 1890.
Results: This approach yielded yearly estimates of initiation, cessation and smoking intensity 
by age for each birth cohort. Smoking initiation probabilities tend to be lower among African 
Americans compared to whites, and cessation probabilities also were generally lower. Higher 
initiation leads to higher smoking prevalence among whites in younger ages, but lower cessa-
tion leads to higher prevalence at older ages in blacks, when adverse health effects of smoking 
become most apparent.
Conclusions: These estimates provide a summary that can be used to better understand the 
effects of changes in smoking behavior following publication of the Surgeon General’s Report 
in 1964.
Implications: A novel method of estimating smoking histories was applied to data from the 
National Health Interview Surveys, which provided an extensive summary of the smoking his-
tory in this population following publication of the Surgeon General’s Report in 1964. 
The results 
suggest that some of the existing disparities in smoking-related disease may be due to the lower 
cessation rates in African Americans compared to whites. However, the number of cigarettes 
smoked is also lower among African Americans. Further work is needed to determine mecha-
nisms by which smoking duration and intensity can account for racial disparities in smoking-
related diseases.
 Introduction
Among preventable causes of death in the United States (US), ciga-
rette smoking has remained firmly at the top of the list for decades.1 
Publication of the first report of the Surgeon General on the health 
consequences of smoking in 19642 inspired the public health com-
munity to launch multipronged efforts to limit those consequences.3–5 
As a result, an estimated 8 million premature deaths were averted 
by 2012, amounting to 31 percent fewer than estimated without 
tobacco control.6 Nevertheless, between 2004 and 2012, 3.2 million 
people died prematurely from cigarette smoking,6 keeping smoking 
a major risk factor affecting health of the US public. Racial/ethnic 
disparities underlie smoking exposure trends and the health conse-
quences of exposure.
Current smoking prevalence among adults 18 years or over 
has declined steadily for blacks and whites, and currently stands 
at about 18 percent for both (see p. 725, Figure 13.13 in the refer-
ence1). However, a more detailed breakdown by age and gender 
reveals differences that can ultimately result in important dis-
similarities as birth cohorts approach ages that have higher risk 
of tobacco related disease.1 Black young adults have lower rates 
of initiation than whites,7 which results in correspondingly lower 
prevalence of current smoking among black high school students, 
although the prevalence trends among all ages 18 and older from 
1991 to 2011 are similar to whites. This apparent contradiction 
results from other differences in the life course of smoking his-
tories for birth cohorts, that is, blacks quit smoking at rates that 
are 10% lower than their white counterparts.1 Because smoking-
related diseases tend to occur at older ages, it is most relevant to 
consider the effects of exposure on disease and mortality rates in 
older age groups. Our goal is not to estimate effects of smoking 
on specific diseases, but we will show that differences in initiation, 
cessation and intensity can ultimately lead to very different cumu-
lative summaries of smoking history in subsets of the US popula-
tion, in the age groups most affected by exposure to this important 
risk factor.
A case in point is lung cancer, a disease risk that is strongly related 
to cigarette smoking, incidence rates which also differs between 
blacks and whites. Rates for males are considerably higher for blacks 
than for whites, and for females rates for blacks are slightly lower 
than whites.8,9 Reasons for these disparities are not well understood, 
but are likely to be due to either different intensities or durations 
of cigarette exposure, especially at ages with high absolute risk of 
lung cancer. Levels of carcinogen exposure may not be conveyed by 
an interview response because of differences in the way individu-
als smoke, the chosen brand or the individuals metabolic function 
for removing toxins. For example, Pérez-Stable et al.10 have shown 
substantial differences between blacks and whites in nicotine uptake, 
thus affecting the net exposure from each cigarette smoked. Hence, 
genomic differences may also play a role in the effect of cigarette 
smoking exposure on disease risk.
In this study, we focus on differences in the level of cigarette 
smoking exposure between blacks and whites. We extend our earlier 
work on smoking trends for all races11 to examine racial differences 
and the effects this might have on risk of tobacco related diseases. 
We use data from the National Health Interview Surveys to con-
struct smoking histories for African Americans and whites born after 
1889, and compare the differences. Our analysis provides informa-
tion on current and former smoker prevalence by age and gender 
as well as average duration of smoking, quantity smoked, and sum-
mary measures of overall smoking history.
Methods
Data
Smoking status (current, former, or never) was elicited in 36 National 
Health Interview Surveys (NHIS) administered from 1965 to 2012 
(1965–1966, 1970, 1974, 1976–1980, 1983, 1985, 1987–1988, 
1990–1995, 1997–2012), where ever-smokers were defined as those 
who smoked 100 lifetime cigarettes.12 While there is some variation 
in the exact wording in the various surveys, smoking status was 
determined by first asking whether they had smoked 100 cigarettes 
over their lifetime (ever-smokers) and if the response was “Yes” 
they were asked if they still smoked regularly (current or former 
smokers). These provided cross-sectional estimates of the smoking 
prevalence by age and survey year. Further detail was provided by a 
subset of these surveys (1970, 1978–1980, 1987–1988, 1992, 1995, 
1997–2001, 2010–2012), which provided retrospective histories of 
age at smoking initiation and cessation, prior to the interview.
Smoking histories among blacks and whites by gender to age 
99 were estimated using the NHIS variable that gives the race 
classification of the respondent for calendar years 1965–2012. 
Individuals reporting race as African American or black represent 
13% or 131 125 (47 782 males and 83 343 females) out of 1 000 
387 subjects in the NHIS data set with smoking histories, whereas 
whites represent 82% or 817 751 (338 195 males and 479 556 
females). Smoking experience over the life course was constructed 
using yearly initiation and cessation probabilities beginning with 
those born after 1889. No birth cohort has been followed from 
birth to age 99. For example, subjects 75 and older are the only 
subjects available from the 1890 birth-cohort in the first survey 
conducted in 1965. Similarly, since the minimum age for survey 
participants is 18, the most recent cohort actually interviewed was 
born in 1994 and would have reported a very short smoking his-
tory. Extrapolation beyond the observed range was necessary to 
more fully capture the overall history of cigarette smoking in the 
population.
Statistical Methods
The method of analysis11 employs a compartment model for smok-
ing history, which begins with the transition from never to current 
smoker, followed by the transition to former smoker. This clearly 
over-simplifies a more complex reality in which individuals often 
attempt cessation several times of varying duration. However, the 
NHIS data are cross-sectional and they do not provide the detail 
required for a more complex model. Separate analyses were con-
ducted for each gender and race. Interpretation of individual tempo-
ral effects attributed to age, period (calendar year) and cohort (year 
of birth) is complicated by the well-known identifiability problem of 
age-period-cohort models, but we are only interested in fitted rates 
that result from the analysis and these are unique and unaffected 
by this phenomenon.13,14 We briefly describe the analytical approach 
below, but further detail on the manner in which the estimates were 
obtained is provided in the Supplementary Material.
Each temporal effect was represented as a constrained natural 
spline,15 which is a semiparametric function for the additive effects 
of age, period and cohort. Maximum likelihood estimates were 
obtained using PROC GENMOD in SAS that uses a generalized 
inverse to resolve the identifiability problem, which in our case con-
strained the cohort slope to zero, but fitted values for outcomes are 
independent of arbitrary constraints used to specify the generalized 
inverse.

 Using the retrospective histories obtained for ever-smokers, we 
first estimate the probability an individual reports initiating at given 
age conditional on the individual being a never-smoker at the begin-
ning of that year. The cumulative proportion of ever-smokers was 
obtained using life table methods,16 but at older ages this estimate 
is biased when compared to estimates in the observed population at 
that age because smokers tend to die earlier than nonsmokers. We 
thus empirically adjusted the initiation probabilities by determining 
cross-sectional prevalence trends by age within cohorts. To align 
actuarial and cross sectional estimates of ever-smoker prevalence 
at a specified age, we obtained a multiplicative constant that was 
applied to the initiation probability used in the actuarial estimate 
that made the two estimates coincide. Cohorts born before 1935 
only have NHIS data for ages 30 or over. Individuals in the survey 
sample represent increasingly older individuals as one evaluates ear-
lier birth cohorts, and the differential mortality in older ages that 
results from cigarette smoking leads to a biased representation of the 
size of the smoking cohort when it was younger. Currently, cohorts 
usually initiate smoking before 30, but it was not uncommon for 
those born early in the twentieth century to initiate later in life, espe-
cially females.17 Because later smoking initiation would also post-
pone the effect of differential mortality, we force alignment for these 
cohorts at the age first surveyed. Otherwise, cohorts are aligned at 
age 30. This process provided adjusted initiation probabilities, as 
well as the prevalence of ever-smokers.
Because smoking cessation is often not successful and shows a 
high rate of relapse in the first 2 years, we defined an individual as a 
former smoker if they had quit at least 2 years before the interview; 
otherwise their observation was censored at the given age of quit-
ting. We estimated the conditional cessation probabilities based on 
the proportion of current smokers at a given age, who quit during 
that year, beginning at age 15. These were then used to generate the 
cumulative probability of quitting by age for each cohort. For most 
surveys, the upper age limit for recruitment was 85, and because 
cessation probabilities were already high they were held constant 
at that point. Alternative assumptions were also tried, but by age 
85 smoking prevalence is low due to cumulative effects of cessation 
and high death rates among smokers, and consequently the specific 
choice made little difference to the results.
The conditional cessation probabilities are used to determine the 
cumulative proportion of smokers who had not quit by age for a 
given cohort. We multiply this cumulative proportion by the ever-
smoker prevalence at each age to obtain current smoking prevalence. 
Former smoker prevalence is found by subtracting current from ever 
prevalence, and never-smoker prevalence is obtained as 1 minus ever-
smoker prevalence. A detailed presentation of the formulae used in 
these calculations are provided in the Supplementary Material.
In the NHIS data, reported numbers of cigarettes smoked per 
day (CPD) were highly clumped at half pack intervals, so smoking 
intensity was classified as an ordered categorical response: CPD ≤ 5; 
5<CPD≤15; 15<CPD≤25; 25<CPD≤35; 35<CPD≤45; and 45<CPD. 
A cumulative logistic age-period-cohort model was fitted, once again 
using constrained natural splines for temporal effects. Fitted prob-
abilities for each dose category provide an estimated smoking inten-
sity distribution for single years of age by birth cohort. Estimates 
for cohorts born before 1920 were constrained to be the same as 
the 1920 birth cohort. Similarly, estimates for cohorts born after 
2002 were arbitrarily constrained to be identical to those of the 
2005 cohort, who would be seven in 2012, the year before earliest 
age at initiation. The mean number of cigarettes smokers consumed 
per day was then determined by using the estimated distribution 
of the categories and an approximate mean of the reported values 
within a category (3: CPD ≤ 5; 10: 5<CPD≤15; 20: 15<CPD≤25; 30: 
25<CPD≤35; 40: 35<CPD≤45; and 60: 45<CPD).
Using details from the smoking histories by birth cohort, we 
obtained summaries of smoking history when the cohort reached 
a particular age. Average cumulative years of exposure for current 
smokers was determined by the average difference between current 
age and age at initiation. Correspondingly, for former smokers the 
average difference between age at cessation and age at initiation rep-
resented their contribution to years of exposure. Weighting by the 
distribution of smoking categories, we obtained the overall average 
exposure per capita for a specific cohort at a given age. Similarly, we 
obtained average per capita pack-years by cumulating CPD over the 
duration of cigarette use in each category. This approach yielded esti-
mates by birth cohort, but these were also rearranged by period in 
order to consider the temporal perspective normally considered for 
public health planning. Details on the formulae used to obtain these 
estimates are provided in the Supplementary Material.
Results
Single birth-cohort estimates of yearly initiation and cessation proba-
bilities, and prevalence were generated by the analysis, but Figures only 
display decennial cohorts. In the Supplementary Material, we display 
animated graphs that show a comparison of observed and fitted esti-
mates of ever, current, and former smokers by gender and race for all 
cohorts (Supplementary Figures A2–A4). Figure 1 shows age-specific 
initiation probabilities for blacks (solid lines) and whites (broken lines) 
(Supplementary Figure A9 displays the difference).
For males (Figure 1a), the initiation probabilities follow similar 
time trends, that is, each cohort reaches a peak in the late teens and 
the overall pattern for those born in the 20th century showed an 
increase until 1920–1930 followed by a decline. However, black 
males have generally had lower rates of initiation when compared 
to whites.
Initiation probabilities for females (Figure 1b) show more com-
plex trends than their male counterparts. In the cohorts born before 
1910, when smoking was considered to be less sociably acceptable in 
women, initiation probabilities were low, but slightly higher for black 
women younger than about 30 compared to whites. For these cohorts, 
the analysis indicates more of a decline after age 25 in black women 
compared to their white counterparts, which showed little decline until 
well after their 30th year, although the small sample size results in con-
siderable uncertainty in these estimates. In cohorts born after about 
1930, the age pattern of increasing to a peak in the late teens and then 
falling to near zero by age 30 was similar for both races and both gen-
ders, although overall levels tend to be lower for females and gender-
specific rates for blacks are lower than their white counterparts. The 
initiation probabilities appear to already be quite high for males born 
at the start of the 20th century, and they continue to increase before 
beginning to decline for those born around 1950 and later. In compar-
ison, initiation probabilities for females mostly occurred after the start 
of the 20th century and did not begin to decline until cohorts born 
after 1960. This decline appears to have been much steeper for black 
females than for white females, otherwise, the patterns for blacks and 
whites appear to track for both genders, with somewhat lower initia-
tion probabilities for blacks.
Cessation probabilities are shown in Figure 2 (Supplementary 
Figure A10 displays the difference). The overall patterns reveal an 
S18

 increasing trend with age and with year of birth. Particularly striking 
is the fairly consistent upturn in 1950s and early 1960s that occurs 
for many cohorts. Females have slightly lower cessation probabilities 
than males, but the cessation probabilities are considerably lower 
for blacks compared to whites, especially for those under 50 years 
of age. As already noted for initiation probabilities, there appears 
to also be a racial difference in cessation for women born early in 
the century. For these women, the cessation probabilities for blacks 
under 50 were higher than whites.
Figure 3 shows current smoker prevalence for each cohort by 
period (Supplementary Figure A11 displays the difference), which 
is essentially driven by the initiation and cessation probabilities. 
Tracing each line from left to right follows the life course of a 
cohort. For male cohorts, the prevalence tends to reach a peak 
that is higher in whites than blacks and but the estimates fall more 
rapidly in whites due to higher cessation probabilities, resulting in 
higher prevalences for blacks older than 50. For females, there is 
a much steeper increase among those born before 1930 because

 of the higher initiation probabilities noted above. Because initia-
tion in these cohorts extends over a longer time span, the prev-
alence for whites eventually overtake those for blacks, but they 
ultimately return to very similar levels in older ages. For cohorts 
born after 1930 but before 1950, the pattern resembles that of the 
males, that is, higher for whites in the younger ages, but higher for 
blacks later in life due to lower cessation probabilities. In recent 
cohorts, the differences in initiation probabilities are much greater, 
so that the prevalence for white females remains higher than that of 
blacks over all ages observed and the lower cessation probabilities 
for black females is not enough for the age-specific prevalence to 
overtake the prevalence for whites. In Supplementary Figure A5 
we show 90% confidence intervals for the corresponding trends 
in blacks.
Former smoker prevalence is displayed in Figure 4 (Supplementary 
Figure A12 displays the difference), which is shown to be considerably

 higher for whites than blacks. This follows from the results noted 
earlier, which indicated that both initiation and cessation tend to be 
lower for blacks. Some modest exceptions to this phenomenon occur 
in female cohorts born before 1930, when initiation probabilities 
among those younger than 30 were higher for blacks, but eventually 
high cessation probabilities for whites result in higher former smoker 
prevalence for even these cohorts. Supplementary Figure A6 shows 
corresponding 90% confidence intervals for the estimates in blacks.
Figure 5 (Supplementary Figure A13 displays the difference) 
shows the estimated mean cigarettes per day for each calendar year 
by cohort. In males born before the 1970s, consumption increased 
with age before declining later in life. In more recent cohorts, the 
trend with age appears to be much less prominent. The most promi-
nent difference by race is that the increase in intensity is much less 
for blacks than for whites in the earlier birth cohorts. At the ages of 
peak consumption, the difference is approximately 10 CPD. Females

Tobacco Research, 2016, Vol. 18, Suppl. 1
 show an overall similar pattern albeit at lower levels than males, 
with a lower difference in consumption at the peak, that is, approxi-
mately 7 CPD.
Figure 6 (Supplementary Figure A14 displays the difference) 
shows the mean cumulative years of exposure (duration) for all 
individuals (current, former, and never smokers) at a given age for 
a specified cohort, which provides one population measure of the 
smoking history burden experienced by a cohort over its lifetime. 
For males, per capita duration is slightly higher for whites but at 
older ages the levels are greater for blacks and the magnitude of the 
difference tends to be greater. With a few exceptions, duration bur-
den tends to remain lower for black females, compared to their white 
counterparts. The crossover with age noted for duration in males, is 
not apparent for pack-years, as shown in Figure 7 (Supplementary 
Figure A15 displays the difference). This reflects the considerably 
lower smoking intensity in blacks of either gender when compared 
to corresponding whites. This results in considerably lower estimates 
of smoking exposure among blacks using this alternative measure of 
Figure 4. Former smoker prevalence by race (black = solid line, white = broken line), gender, calendar year, and birth cohort.

 exposure. Supplementary Figure A7 shows 90% confidence intervals 
for the estimated trends in cumulative years smoked in blacks.
Figure 8 presents the duration burden for each single year birth 
cohort at age 65 by race and gender. After 1980, black males have 
higher levels of duration burden than whites. For females, on the 
other hand, levels for blacks are somewhat lower than for whites 
prior to 1990, with little difference thereafter.
Trends in pack-years for those aged 65 are shown in Figure 9. 
While the shapes of the curves are similar, the values are considerably 
lower for blacks, which results from the correspondingly lower esti-
mates of intensity (mean cigarettes per day) already noted. For males, 
there has been a substantial decline since 1990, but there has been lit-
tle changes for black females. Supplementary Figure A8 shows 90% 
confidence intervals for the trends in mean pack-years for blacks.

 Discussion
The Smoking History Generator (SHG) that was developed by the 
National Cancer Institute and the Cancer Intervention Modeling 
Network (CISNET)17 was recently updated to include surveys con-
ducted through 2009.11 Results presented here provide a further 
update by including NHIS data through 2012 and by investigat-
ing race differences. The analytical approach enhanced the initial 
estimates of smoking history parameters by making use of a more 
comprehensive age-period-cohort model that considered all of the 
data in a single analysis, instead of separate analyses for 5-year birth 
cohorts that were subsequently smoothed in a secondary analysis 
of the results for each cohort.17,18 Combining these two steps into a 
single modeling framework provided greater statistical power, which 
made it feasible to obtain yearly estimates with smaller sample sizes. 
In this analysis we made use of that power to consider smoking his-
tories in the African American population, which represents only 
13% or 131 125 (47 782 male and 83 343 female) out of 1 000 387 
Figure 6. Mean cumulative years of smoking by race (black = solid line, white = broken line), gender, calendar year, and birth cohort.

 subjects in the NHIS data set. This allowed us to compare smok-
ing histories in this minority population with the experience in the 
majority white population. Another strength of this new approach is 
that it can be modified to include the effects of covariates, for exam-
ple, ethnicity, education, and socioeconomic status.
Race is one of the variables elicited by survey respondents, but 
the manner in which this was obtained changed over time, espe-
cially when the need for better data on minority groups was appre-
ciated. Initially, race was based on the interviewer’s observation, 
but even when respondents identified their race in later sur-
veys there was considerable variation in how the question was 
worded.19 In this analysis we used the race classification reported 
in the survey, but this variation over time is an unavoidable limita-
tion in these data. It is difficult to determine how these changes 
in NHIS methodology would have affected the results presented 
here. However, it is clear that race issues need to be carefully con-
sidered when developing public health policies to control health 
effects of smoking.

 We have used data from the NHIS surveys that were collected 
from 1965 to 2012 to estimate initiation and cessation probabilities; 
current, former, and never smoking prevalences; and, the distribu-
tion of smoking intensities by single years of age and single year 
birth cohorts beginning in 1890. Some detail, for example, age at 
initiation and cessation, was necessarily obtained retrospectively 
from subjects’ memories of their past history, which is a limitation 
that results from the lack of longitudinal data. Differential mortality 
due to adverse effects of cigarette smoking result in a biased sample 
when cohorts are queried later in life, making it necessary to adjust 
the crude estimates of initiation probabilities.20 We employed a 
method that empirically controls for this bias, and provides a means 
for making the adjustment by estimating the effect of selection bias 
using only the data from NHIS.11 In the results presented here, the 
analyses were carried out separately by race and gender, which pro-
vides for any differences in the adjustment that may have arisen.
Figure 1 shows the contrasting ways in which initiation proba-
bilities changed over the course of the 20th century by both race and 
by gender, which reflects some of the societal influences on cigarette 
smoking. For males, the shape of the curves was similar and the birth

 cohort pattern was also similar, with the peak increasing for cohorts 
born early in the century and reaching a zenith for those born in 
the 1920s. This pattern is consistent with the increased popularity 
of cigarette smoking among males and the very effective strategy of 
building a market for male smokers by distributing free cigarettes to 
those enlisted for military service in World War II. The subsequent 
decline coincides with the growth in understanding of the health 
consequences of smoking. In general, the initiation probabilities are 
consistently lower for blacks in comparison to whites.
By contrast, the initiation probability patterns for women dif-
fer somewhat by race. For the 1900 birth cohort there is more of a 
decline after the late teens for black females while the probabilities 
for whites changed very little well into their 40s. This suggests some-
what less of a rebound for black females as a result of increasing 
acceptability of smoking by women. In addition, this period is one of 
the few instances in which a black cohort had somewhat higher ini-
tiation probabilities compared to whites. As the century progressed, 
initiation probabilities for blacks are lower than whites, and the dif-
ference in the peak levels are generally greater than the correspond-
ing race comparison for males.
Cessation probabilities are consistently lower for blacks, but the 
pattern of increase with age is much less for black females than for 
either white females or males of either race. The differences in initia-
tion and cessation give rise to distinct prevalence trends and they 
explain why adult smoking prevalence for blacks is very similar to 
whites even though initiation probabilities are lower for blacks. For 
males, current smoker prevalence (Figure 3) is consistently high in 
younger ages for whites, a pattern that is subsequently reversed for 
older ages as a result of lower cessation probabilities in blacks so 
that one can only appreciate what is occurring in the population 
by evaluating the age patterns. In birth cohorts born before 1920, 
this reversal is not as clear for females, but among the later birth 
cohorts the pattern is similar to males. The higher prevalence of 
smoking among blacks for older ages is significant because many 
of the health conditions associated with smoking, like lung cancer 
or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, tend to occur later in life.
The framework in which we have developed these estimates 
made use of simplifying assumptions, which were necessary due to 
data that were limited to cross sectional surveys. We only considered 
single transitions from never- to ever-smoker and current to former 
smoker. For initiation this is reasonable, in that we define smokers 
as those who have smoked at least 100 cigarettes. Cessation, on the 
other hand, often requires more than one attempt, and the nature 
of the NHIS data does not provide the necessary detail that would 
allow for a detailed analysis of this process. Our definition of for-
mer smokers were those smokers who had not smoked for at least 
2 years in order to limit the number of transitions between current 
and former smokers. The model provides a good fit to the crude 
estimates of prevalence obtained directly from the NHIS data, except 
for age 25–34 in which the fitted estimates for former smokers are 
slightly lower and for current smokers they are slightly higher (see 
results in Supplementary Material). This would be expected if a sub-
ject reported that they had quit but then relapsed after the interview. 
With no way to determine post-interview relapse from the cross-
section NHIS survey, relapses would not ultimately satisfy the defini-
tion of cessation used in our analysis.
Two commonly used summary measures of smoking history in 
the population are mean per capita duration of smoking and mean 
pack-years. Work by Doll and Peto21 and by Flanders et al.22 indi-
cate that duration is more strongly associated lung cancer mortality 
risk so this is likely to be a better predictor of risk for this disease. 
While smoking intensity improves estimates of risk, pack-years is 
not the optimal way to include this information. More recent work 
with additional cohort data indicates that an even better estimate 
of lung cancer mortality risk can be achieved by including life his-
tory of exposure.23,24 This work implies that age at initiation and 
cessation provides better estimates of risk that are not captured 
by duration, alone, and the history of smoking intensity further 
improves estimates of risk. Hence, both summary measures of smok-
ing history have limitations and this is especially true for pack-years. 
Nevertheless, pack-years are still widely used, perhaps because 
it is relatively easy to compute and interpretation makes intuitive 
sense. The US Preventive Services Task Force25 and the Centers for 
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)26 use 30 pack-years as one 
of the criteria for lung cancer screening eligibility. Our summary 
of these two measures at age 65 (Figures 8 and 9), when risk of 
tobacco related diseases are increasing, shows that black males tend 
to have lower mean pack-years exposure but higher mean duration 
compared to whites. However, lung cancer risk among black males 
is as great as or greater than whites. The substantially lower mean 
pack-years for black males that does not result in a correspondingly 
lower lung cancer risk may result in fewer screens than would be 
appropriate for this group. When quantifying the impact of smoking 
on disease control, a single summary is usually not adequate, but it 
is best accomplished by assessing the manner in which risk for that 
specific disease is affected by age, duration, time since cessation, and 
intensity.
While smoking prevalence is slightly lower for younger black 
males, the lower cessation probabilities result in higher prevalence 
of current smokers later in the history of the birth cohort. The net 
effect of this has resulted in declining mean duration of exposure for 
both whites and blacks, but the estimates for blacks is slightly greater 
than whites since 2000 (Figure 8). For females, on the other hand, 
there has been little temporal trend in mean duration and little differ-
ence by race. There are considerably larger differences in exposure as 
measured by pack-years, which are considerably lower for blacks than 
whites, as a result of substantially lower levels of CPD reported to 
NHIS. This is puzzling given the higher rates of lung cancer in blacks. 
However, the reasons for the difference are not well understood, and 
they may reflect racial/ethnic differences in the metabolism of toxic 
components of tobacco smoke, the manner in which cigarettes are 
used or the preference of different brands. For example, Pérez-Stable 
et al. showed that total and nonrenal clearances of cotinine were sig-
nificantly lower for blacks compared to whites. In addition, blacks 
had 30% higher nicotine intake per cigarette. In combination, this 
may explain higher levels of cotinine per cigarette smoked, which may 
in turn reduce the number of cigarettes blacks would need to smoke in 
order to produce a comparable pharmacologic effect.10 Duration, of 
course, would not be affected by this and it remains unclear as to how 
these differences would affect the toxic effects on lung cancer. Further 
work is needed to understand reasons for these racial/ethnic differ-
ences in smoking behavior, but what does seem clear is that there may 
be important racial/ethnic differences in the effects that need to be 
considered when developing control strategies for cigarette smoking.
The tobacco industry has historically targeted particular brands 
in different segments of the cigarette market. Menthol cigarettes 
have been aggressively advertised to African Americans and this 
group disproportionately use mentholated cigarettes compared to 
whites. This is one fundamental racial/ethnic difference that has 
existed for decades and African Americans continue to be a target of 
S27

 advertisements for menthol cigarettes.27 We found that blacks initi-
ate smoking at lower rates and smokers smoke fewer cigarettes, but 
have lower cessation. These opposing tendencies may be due to the 
greater use of menthol cigarettes among black smokers than white 
smokers but it is not clear that this is actually the underlying cause 
for the difference.28 Further investigation is needed in this area.
These results provide an early step in the search for effective ways 
to control the many diseases caused by cigarette smoking, including 
lung cancer, heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Lung cancer, for example, has been thought to be more strongly related 
to duration than intensity, which would suggest that the difference in 
mean duration was more relevant than the difference in pack-years. 
However, other work with carcinogenesis models indicates that not 
only does intensity play a role, but one must also consider both age 
at initiation and age at cessation, that is, duration by itself is not an 
adequate measure of exposure. Both of the exposure summary meas-
ures presented here have limitations and they are meant to provide 
easily understood differences in the experience of African Americans. 
Pack-years in particular has been seen to have serious limitations, even 
though it is commonly used to control for smoking history in epide-
miological studies. A primary reason for including pack-years in these 
results is the fact that this is used in identifying eligibility for lung cancer 
screening. The fact that lung cancer risk is higher for African American 
males than it is for their white counterparts, even though they have 
lower mean pack-years of exposure then this might point to a need to 
consider alternative criteria for determining screening eligibility.
A strength of the NHIS data is that it represents a probability 
sample of the US population, but a limitation arises from the fact 
that events prior to 1965 rely on recall of initiation and cessation by 
the respondents. Before 1974, data were either self-reported or elic-
ited from a proxy who maybe another adult member of the house-
hold. Proxy data are usually valid for current smoking status, but 
they may not be valid for age at initiation and cessation, or intensity. 
In particular, the data from the 1970 NHIS survey may be biased.29,30
These results will be useful in distinguishing differential effects of 
smoking by race on lung cancer, heart disease and chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease. Our results suggest that some of the existing 
disparities in smoking related-conditions may be due to the lower 
cessation rates of black compared to white smokers. However, the 
number of cigarettes smoked is lower among blacks, which may 
reflect smoking cigarettes closer to the butt or the use of menthol 
cigarettes. In further work, we plan to investigate the role of smok-
ing duration, intensity and type of cigarettes in explaining racial dis-
parities in the rate of deaths due to the various diseases.
