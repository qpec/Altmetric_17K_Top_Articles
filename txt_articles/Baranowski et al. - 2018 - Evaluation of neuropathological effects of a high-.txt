Abstract
Metabolic dysfunction related to diet-induced obesity has recently been linked
to the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the
underlying mechanisms linking obesity and AD remain unclear. The purpose
of this study was to examine early alterations in brain insulin signaling,
inflammatory/stress markers, and energetic stress in a model of diet-induced
obesity during middle age. Male C57BL/6J mice were randomized to either a
control diet (AGE n = 12) or high-fat and sucrose diet (AGE-HFS n = 12) for
13-weeks from 20-weeks of age. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampal samples
were collected at 20-weeks of age (BSL n = 11) and at 33-weeks of age (AGE
and AGE-HFS). The HFS diet resulted in increased body weight (30%;
P = 0.0001), increased %fat mass (28%; P = 0.0001), and decreased %lean
mass (33%; P = 0.0001) compared to aged controls. In the prefrontal cortex,
AGE-HFS resulted in increased 50 adenosine monophosphate – activated pro-
tein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation (P = 0.045). In the hippocampus, AGE-
HFS resulted in increased extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and
c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation and protein kinase B (Akt)
serine473 and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) phosphorylation (P < 0.05).
Results from this study demonstrate that aging combined with a HFS diet
results in increased inflammation (pERK and pJNK) and energetic stress
(pAMPK) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, respectively. Together
these novel results provide important information for future targets in early
AD pathogenesis.
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenera-
tive disorder resulting in cognitive decline later in life.
Aging is the largest risk factor for AD (Jorm et al. 1987),
however diet-induced obesity is directly implicated in
the etiology of AD (Lester-Coll et al. 2006; Verdelho
et al. 2007; Maesako et al. 2012a,b, 2013; Bhat and
Thirumangalakudi 2013). A recent analysis of obesity
trends demonstrated that middle-aged Americans have
the highest obesity rate of any age group at 41.0% (Flegal
et al. 2016), and research has proven that obesity in mid-
dle age can be an index of mild cognitive impairment at
later years (Nguyen et al. 2014). Given the current lack of
effective treatments for AD, and considering AD as a
metabolic disease an understanding of the underlying

 molecular mechanisms occurring during the presymp-
tomatic stages is of considerable importance.
AD is characterized by two histopathological hallmarks:
(1) the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein (Ab) pla-
ques; and (2) hyper-phosphorylated tau tangles (Behl and
Holsboer 1998). These Ab peptides have been established
as key players in the neuronal degradation that occurs in
AD (Gouras et al. 2005), and plays a fundamental role in
the mechanisms of early progression of AD (Selkoe 2004;
Gandy 2005). Despite an abundance of information con-
cerning AD pathophysiology, the initial events that trigger
Ab plaque formation are poorly understood. Ab origi-
nates from a large type 1 transmembrane protein, known
as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Selkoe 2001).
The b-secretase pathway is initiated by beta-site amyloid
precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the rate-
limiting
protease
enzyme
in
the
production
of
Ab
peptides.
Diet-induced obesity has been implicated in accelerat-
ing Ab production in the development of AD (Lester-Coll
et al. 2006; Verdelho et al. 2007; Maesako et al. 2012a,b,
2013; Bhat and Thirumangalakudi 2013). For example,
high-fat feeding of wild-type C57BL6/J mice has resulted
in increased brain BACE1 and APP protein content, as
well as beta-amyloid peptides (Thirumangalakudi et al.
2008; Puig et al. 2012). Work from our group has
demonstrated that high-fat feeding of wild-type C57BL6/J
mice results in an increase in BACE1 activity (Macpher-
son et al. 2015). Furthermore, several rodent models of
diabetes (genetic, diet and streptozotocin induced) results
in increased BACE1 content and beta-amyloid generation
in the brain (Li et al. 2007; Zhang et al. 2009). Similarly,
diet-induced obesity has been shown to accelerate beta-
amyloid pathology in transgenic mouse models of AD
(Maesako et al. 2012b, 2013; Bhat and Thirumangalakudi
2013). Sprague Dawley rats fed a high-sugar and high-fat
diet for 12 months exhibited increased brain beta-amyloid
peptides and phosphorylated tau as early as 6 months
(Niu et al. 2016). These studies demonstrate that obesity
can promote AD-like neuropathology, however these
studies have examined the effects in a number of different
ages and the underlying mechanisms and pathways that
contribute to this complex neurodegenerative disease in
the early stages remain unclear.
Alterations in inflammatory/cellular stress pathways
(mitogen-activated protein kinases, MAPK), insulin sig-
naling, and markers of energetic stress (50 adenosine
monophosphate – activated protein kinase, AMPK) have
all been implicated in AD and the amyloidogenic path-
way. The MAPK pathways (extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK))
are activated by extracellular and intracellular stimuli
related to stress. MAPKs are serine-threonine kinases that
mediate cellular signaling associated with various cellular
activities, which include, cell proliferation, differentiation,
survival, and apoptosis (Chang and Karin 2001). The acti-
vated MAPK pathways are thought to contribute to AD
pathogenesis through various mechanisms including neu-
ronal apoptosis (Hashimoto et al. 2003; Puig et al. 2004),
increased BACE1 expression (Tamagno et al. 2009), and
the phosphorylation of APP by JNK (Muresan and Mure-
san 2007; Colombo et al. 2009). Given this link between
MAPK pathways and AD, studies examining brain MAPK
pathways with obesity are scarce and have inconsistent
results. For example, previous work demonstrated that
both ERK and p38 phosphorylation were reduced in 24-
month-old Fischer rats compared to 6- and 12-month-old
rats (Zhen et al. 1999), while a recent study examined
diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in mice,
demonstrated an increase in ERK phosphorylation and a
trend for increased p38 phosphorylation (Macpherson
et al. 2015). A 1 year high-sugar high-fat diet resulted in
increases in beta-amyloid content along with increased
phosphorylated JNK in the hippocampus of rats as early
as 6 months (Niu et al. 2016), however an understanding
of the temporal relationship between these outcomes is
lacking.
Obesogenic diets often result in insulin resistance and a
state of energetic stress in peripheral tissues and evidence
indicates that obesity also alters brain insulin signaling
and in turn energy status. Aberrant control of insulin sig-
naling through the PI3-kinase and protein kinase B (Akt)
has been demonstrated in brain tissue from human AD
patients as well as in animal brains of diet-induced obe-
sity. In human AD samples, Griffin et al. (2005) found
increased Akt phosphorylation with significant increases
in the phosphorylation of several Akt substrates, including
glycogen synthase kinase (GSK). This is important, as
GSK has been directly implicated in the progression of
AD. Rodent work has demonstrated an ~2-fold increase
in Akt phosphorylation in prefrontal cortex samples from
young male C57BL6 mice (~16 weeks of age) following a
high-fat diet (Macpherson et al. 2015) as well as aged
mice following 5 months of high-fat feeding (Muller et al.
2008). Human brains from AD patients demonstrate
abnormally activated AMPK (Vingtdeux et al. 2011; Ma
et al. 2014) and this thought to be a marker of perturbed
brain energy metabolism. The influence of aging and/or
diet on brain AMPK activity is poorly understood. Few
studies have focused on the direct effect of aging or obe-
sogenic diet on AMPK activity (as indicated by phospho-
rylation of Thr172), and many of them are contradictory
to previous findings. Previous work has demonstrated a
decrement in AMPK activation with age in 28-month-old
Fisher 344 male rats, however the mechanisms remain
unknown (Reznick et al. 2007). It is thought that these

 age associated decreases in AMPK activity may contribute
to mitochondrial dysfunction (Jornayvaz and Shulman
2010), which has been associated with the pathogenesis of
AD. However, previous work has determined that there is
an elevation of the phosphorylation of AMPK in 12-
month-old AD mouse model (APPswe/PS1d9E) when com-
pared to wild type (Ma et al. 2014). Further investigation
is needed to accurately determine how aging and a high-
fat diet influence the activity and expression of AMPK.
The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of
an obesogenic diet on brain metabolic changes in adult
male C57BL/6J mice as they transition from adulthood to
middle age. Specifically, this study examined markers of
inflammation/cellular stress, insulin signaling and ener-
getic stress, all of which have been shown to have impli-
cations in the progression of AD. We hypothesize that the
consumption of a high-fat high-sucrose diet will exacer-
bate the effects of aging on the metabolic pathways
related to the progression of AD.

(Bott

Male

mice
(19-weeks;
26.9 � 1.9 g, n = 35) were purchased from The Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) and allowed to
acclimatize for 5 days in the Brock University Compara-
tive Biosciences Facility. During acclimatization, mice
were
fed
standard
chow
(2014

14%
protein rodent maintenance diet, Harlan Tekland, Mis-
sissauga, ON). Following acclimatization, mice were ran-
domized to baseline (BSL, n = 11), control diet and
aging (AGE, n = 12), or high-fat-sucrose diet in con-
junction with aging (AGE-HFS, n = 12). All mice were
kept on a 12-h light: 12-h dark cycle and had ad libitum
access to food and water through the entirety of the
study.
Experimental design
Baseline measures of all mice (n = 35) were conducted at
20 weeks of age and included body mass measurements
and in vivo lCT scans for body composition (%fat mass,
%lean mass). Following baseline measurements, the BSL
group (n = 11) was euthanized at 22 weeks of age. The
AGE (n = 12, diet TD.94048, Harlan Teklad, Mississauga,
ON) and the AGE-HFS groups (AGE-HFS, n = 12, diet
TD.150448, 45% kcal fat, Harlan Teklad, Mississauga,
ON) were switched to their corresponding diets for the
13-week diet and aging intervention. Harlan Teklad Diet
assisted in developing diets that were consistent with pre-
vious high fat studies (as previously outlined in detail by
(Bott et al. 2017)). Briefly, the control diet (AGE) con-
sisted of 13.7% kcal protein, 75.9% kcal carbohydrates,
10.3% fat and contained 3.6 kcal/g energy. The HFS diet
consisted of 13.8% kcal protein, 40.8% kcal carbohy-
drates, 45.3% fat and contained 4.6 kcal/g energy. To
account for the higher energy per quantity of HFS diet,
protein and micronutrients were adjusted accordingly, to
provide a similar level of these nutrients on the basis of
energy (Buettner et al. 2007; Bott et al. 2017). These diet
were phytoestrogen free. Body composition measurements
were taken longitudinally at 20, 24, 28, and 32 weeks of
age, the in vivo body scans were completed using the
Bruker Skyscan 1176 lCT (Kontich, Belgium). As well,
body weight was measured three times a week using a
pan balance throughout the duration of the study. After
the 13-week diet/age intervention, the remaining groups
(AGE and AGE-HFS) were then euthanized for tissue
collection.
Tissue collection
Mice were anaesthetized with 5% isoflurane (CDMV).
Mice were euthanized by exsanguination by severing the
aorta and vena cava. Collection of brain specific regions
(left and right prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) were
dissected according to Spijker (2011). Briefly, surgical
scissors were used to remove the head with a cut poste-
rior to the ears and a midline incision was made to
remove the skin to expose the skull. A small incision was
then made at the base of the parietal bone and then cut

 through to the most anterior part of the skull (i.e., frontal
bone). Forceps were then used to peel back and break off
both sides of the parietal bone. Once the brain was
uncovered, curved surgical scissors (closed) were slid
underneath the posterior part of the brain and gently
lifted up. The scissors were then used to sever the cranial
nerves, freeing the brain. Once the brain was removed
from the skull, a surgical scalpel was used to dissect the
brain into the left and right hemispheres. Once isolated
into the respective sides, the left and right prefrontal cor-
tex and hippocampus were removed. Samples were snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at �80°C for Wes-
tern blotting analysis.
Western blotting
Samples were homogenized (FastPrep�, MP Biomedicals,
Santa Ana, CA) in 20 volumes of RIPA lysis buffer (ab-
cam,
ab15603)
supplemented
with
protease
(Sigma-
Aldrich,
11836170001)
and
phosphatase
inhibitors
(Sigma-Aldrich, 04906845001). The homogenized samples
were placed on a shaker in a 4°C fridge for 20 min to
reduce foam accumulation. Homogenized samples were
then centrifuged at 4°C (15 min @ 10,000g), after which
the supernatant was collected and protein concentration
was determined using a Bicinchoninic acid assay (Sigma-
Aldrich - B9643, VWR – BDH9312). The samples were
prepared to contain equal concentrations of protein in 2x
Laemmli buffer and placed in a dry bath at 100°C for
5 min. Twenty micrograms of protein were loaded and
separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels for 90 min at 120 V.
Proteins were then wet-transferred onto nitrocellulose
membrane at 100 V for 60 min. Membranes were blocked
in Tris buffered saline/0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) with 5%
non-fat powdered milk for 1 h at room temperature. The
appropriate primary antibody (1:1000 ratio) was then
applied and left to incubate shaking overnight at 4°C.
Following primary incubation, the membrane was washed
with TBST 3 9 5 min and then incubated with the corre-
sponding secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (1:2000 ratio) for 1 h at room temperature.
Signals were detected using enhanced chemiluminesence
and were subsequently quantified by densitometry using a
FluorChem HD imaging system (Alpha Innotech, Santa
Clara, CA).
Statistical analysis
Differences in protein content and phosphorylation were
determined using one-way ANOVA followed by a Tukey’s
post hoc test. A Shapiro-Wilk test for normality was
conducted and in cases where data were not normally
distributed, the data was logarithmically transformed.
A value of P < 0.05 was considered significant. All data
are reported as mean � SEM.
Results
Body weight and composition
Data for body weight and body composition have previ-
ously been reported (Bott et al. 2017). Briefly, prior to
the dietary intervention there were no differences in body
weight between groups (BSL, AGE, AGE-HFS). Following
the 13-week diet/age intervention, the AGE-HFS group
had a body mass that was 30% higher than the AGE
group (P = 0.0001). Both AGE and AGE-HFS groups had
an increase in fat mass (P = 0.0001), however AGE-HFS
had a greater increase (79%) when compared to AGE
(51%; P = 0.0001). A decline in lean mass was observed
in both AGE and AGE-HFS (P = 0.0001), however AGE-
HFS had a greater decline in lean mass (46%) when com-
pared to AGE (13%; P = 0.001). The results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the HFS diet to induce a state of
obesity.
Markers of inflammation/cellular stress
The MAPK pathway is thought to be one of the major
pathways involved in the progression of AD due to their
role in various mechanisms; for example, increased neu-
ronal apoptosis, increased activation of BACE1, and phos-
phorylation of APP (Hashimoto et al. 2003; Marques
et al. 2003; Puig et al. 2004). Changes in total and phos-
phorylated content of each of the MAPK sub-families
were examined. There were no differences in total p38,
ERK, or JNK protein content across all groups in the pre-
frontal cortex and the hippocampus. There were no
differences between groups for pERK, pJNK, or phospho-
p38 in the prefrontal cortex (Fig. 1A). In the hippocam-
pus, there was significantly higher pERK content in the
AGE-HFS group compared to BSL and AGE (P = 0.02).
Both the AGE and AGE-HFS groups had higher pJNK
protein content compared to BSL (Fig. 1B) (P = 0.005).
Markers of insulin resistance
Evidence suggests that obesity-related diseases, due to
insulin resistance, contribute to neurodegenerative pro-
cesses such as AD (Bigornia et al. 2012; Candeias et al.
2012). In both the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus
no differences in total Akt or GSK-3b protein content
were observed. The prefrontal cortex demonstrated higher
Akt serine 473 phosphorylation in both AGE and AGE-
HFS groups compared to BSL (P = 0.03) with no differ-
ences in Akt threonine 308 phosphorylation or GSK-3b

 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). The hippocampus demon-
strated higher Akt serine 473 phosphorylation in both
AGE
and
AGE-HFS
groups
compared
to
BSL
(P = 0.0008) with no differences in Akt threonine 308
phosphorylation. Furthermore, in the hippocampus there
was higher GSK-3b phosphorylation in the AGE-HFS
group compared to BSL (Fig. 2B) (P = 0.002).
Markers of energetic stress
AMPK is a marker of perturbed brain energy metabolism
and is abnormally activated in AD (Vingtdeux et al.
2011; Ma et al. 2014). Further AMPK has been found to
increase BACE1 protein content and activity (Chen et al.
2009). In the prefrontal cortex there were no differences
in total AMPK content between experimental groups;
however, there was a higher phosphorylated AMPK con-
tent
in
the
AGE-HFS
compared
to
BSL
and
AGE
(P = 0.045) (Fig. 3A). In the hippocampus, there were no
significant differences in either total or phosphorylated
AMPK (Fig. 3B).
Amyloid precursors protein processing
BACE1 is considered to be a biomarker for detection and
prediction of AD (Hampel and Shen 2009). To examine
the effects of aging and aging with a high-fat/sucrose diet
on markers of early AD progression, changes in BACE1,
total APP and sAPPb protein content were measured. In
the prefrontal cortex (Fig. 4A), there were no statistically
significant changes in BACE1 content, total APP or
sAPPb in either group. In the hippocampus, no changes
in BACE1 content, total APP or sAPPb were detected
(Fig. 4B).
Discussion
This study provides novel insight into the early alterations
that occur in the brain in response to a HFS diet during
the transition from adulthood to middle age in male
mice. Our results demonstrate that alone the transition
into middle age results in higher hippocampal JNK and

 period while consuming a HFS diet results in even higher
hippocampal JNK and Akt Ser473 phosphorylation as well
as ERK and GSK-3b phosphorylation. Furthermore, in
the prefrontal cortex the HFS diet resulted in increased
AMPK phosphorylation indicative of energetic stress.
These results highlight neuroinflammation/stress, altered
brain insulin signaling, and increased energetic stress as
important brain alterations with diet-induced obesity in
middle age. This work advances our current knowledge of
the underlying mechanisms and pathways that may lead
to AD related pathologies in the early stages of the dis-
ease. Additional novel results from this work demonstrate
region specific differences between the prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus in response to aging with a HFS diet,
indicating that the disease pathology is not uniform
throughout the brain.
Previous work has demonstrated that MAPK signaling
is activated in neuronal populations in individuals with
AD. Specifically, work examining brain samples from AD
patients has demonstrated that neurons and dystrophic
neurites have higher JNK (Shoji et al. 2000; Zhu et al.
2001b), p38 (Hensley et al. 1999; Zhu et al. 2000), and
ERK activation (Perry et al. 1999; Ferrer et al. 2001a).
Here, our results show that aging from adulthood to mid-
dle age alone resulted in higher JNK phosphorylation in
the hippocampus, while aging with the consumption of a
HFS diet resulted in even higher ERK and JNK phospho-
rylation in the hippocampus. This is interesting as the

 simultaneous activation of ERK and JNK is thought to
represent
one
of
the
earliest
events
in
the
disease
pathogenesis that precipitates further alterations (Zhu
et al. 2001a). An examination of MAPKs in brain tissue
from post-mortem patients with varying levels of neu-
rodegeneration, from limited pathology to severe AD,
revealed that in control cases without any pathology
either ERK alone or JNK alone were phosphorylated,
whereas in samples demonstrating limited to full AD
pathology both ERK and JNK were simultaneously acti-
vated (Zhu et al. 2001a). The results of the present
study demonstrate similar findings with the transition
from adulthood to middle age resulting in higher hip-
pocampal phosphorylation of JNK while the addition of
a HFS diet during this transition results in an increase
in both ERK and JNK phosphorylation. This persistent
activation of JNK and ERK with the HFS indicates that
the hippocampus is under chronic inflammatory stimu-
lation and cellular stress and that this may result in the
progression of neurodegeneration and AD-like patholo-
gies. Our results are further corroborated by earlier
studies suggesting that obesity/high fat diets lead to
chronic
inflammation
(Spielman
et al.
2014)
and
increased release of interleukin 1b and TNFa, which are
known activators of the MAPKs (Davis et al. 2000; Kim
and Choi 2010). These kinases may provide a link to
the initiation of AD pathologies. For example, ERK is
one of the kinases known to phosphorylate tau and has
been shown to be associated with neurofibrillary tangles
and senile plaques (Ferrer et al. 2001b). Furthermore,
abnormal
ERK
activation
in
the
hippocampus
may
impair hippocampal function and contribute to memory
deficits
in
AD
patients
(Sun
and
Nan
2017).
Our
results add to the current literature by providing novel
insights into the temporal relationship of these kinases
to one another in response to a HFS diet. Further work
is needed to examine the relationship to more down-
stream
events
related
to
the
pathogenesis
of
AD.
Together this information may help to design strategies
that can specifically attenuate ERK and/or JNK pro-
moted neuronal pathologies.
In addition to increased MAPK activity, our results
show that transitioning into middle age resulted in
increased hippocampal Akt serine 473 phosphorylation,
while aging with the HFS diet resulted in increased Akt
serine 473 phosphorylation in both the prefrontal cortex
and the hippocampus. Brain tissue from post-mortem

 phosphorylation in both hippocampal and cortical neu-
rons (Pei et al. 2003; Rickle et al. 2004; Griffin et al.
2005). Pei et al. (2003) detected increased Akt threonine
308 phosphorylation associated with varying levels of neu-
rodegeneration, while other studies have demonstrated
increased Akt serine 473 phosphorylation in models of
AD (Rickle et al. 2004; Griffin et al. 2005; Bhaskar et al.
2009; Kothari et al. 2017). Together, these results would
indicate possible constitutive activation of Akt in AD as
well as in the early stages of diet-induced obesity associ-
ated neurodegeneration. Activation of Akt is initiated by
insulin in a biphasic manner, first by phosphorylation at
threonine 308 and then at serine 473. Threonine 308
phosphorylation plays an important role in glucose trans-
port and cell survival, while serine 473 exerts potent inhi-
bitory effects on insulin receptor activity (Tian 2005).
Prolonged activation of Akt leads to serine 473 phospho-
rylation and the negative feedback loop that inhibits insu-
lin signaling (Zhao et al. 2008). The observed increase in
Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in the current study may rep-
resent insulin resistance in the brain and would have
broad consequences for brain function. Akt signaling is a
central focus for insulin signaling and the modulation of
several cellular processes, including metabolism, growth
and proliferation (Brazil et al. 2004). Persistent elevation
of Akt serine 473 phosphorylation in brain appears unde-
sirable as abnormally enhanced serine 473 phosphoryla-
tion is associated with memory deficits (Dou et al. 2005)
and is evident in AD brain (Rickle et al. 2004; Griffin
et al. 2005).
In addition to increased inflammatory/cellular stress
markers and altered insulin signaling, the AGE-HFS
group also demonstrated increased phosphorylation of
AMPK in the prefrontal cortex. These findings support
the hypothesis that aging and aging superimposed with a
HFS diet increase neural energetic stress, and are in agree-
ment with previous studies (Vingtdeux et al. 2011; Ma
et al. 2014; Macpherson et al. 2015). There were no
changes in AMPK phosphorylation in the hippocampus
thus indicating regional differences in the response to an
obesogenic diet. The different responses of the prefrontal
cortex and hippocampus to aging and the HFS may be
due to differences in energy metabolism between the two
regions or it may indicate a different time course in the
progression of disease. Further work is needed to examine
these regional differences.

 Conclusions
This study provides novel information in relation to the
mechanistic link between obesity and the transition from
adulthood into middle age and signaling cascades that
may be related to AD pathology later in life. Our results
demonstrate that aging combined with a HFS diet exacer-
bates the effects of aging on inflammation/stress (ERK
and JNK phosphorylation) in the hippocampus, and ener-
getic stress in the prefrontal cortex. Such adaptations in
the prefrontal cortex versus hippocampal regions suggest
that disease pathology is not uniform throughout the
brain. Furthermore, the HFS diet resulted in higher phos-
phorylation of Akt Ser473 in both the prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus. These results add to our basic under-
standing of the pathways involved in the early progression
of AD pathogenesis and demonstrate the negative effects
of a HFS diet on both the prefrontal cortex and hip-
pocampal regions.
