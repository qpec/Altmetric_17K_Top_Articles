IMPORTANCE Depressive disorders (DDs), anxiety disorders (ADs), obsessive-compulsive
disorder (OCD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are common mental disorders in
children and adolescents.
OBJECTIVE To examine the relative efficacy and safety of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and placebo for the
treatment of DD, AD, OCD, and PTSD in children and adolescents.
DATA SOURCES PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database from
inception through August 7, 2016.
STUDY SELECTION Published and unpublished randomized clinical trials of SSRIs or SNRIs in
youths with DD, AD, OCD, or PTSD were included. Trials using other antidepressants
(eg, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors) were excluded.
DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Effect sizes, calculated as standardized mean differences
(Hedges g) and risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events, were assessed in a random-effects model.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes, as defined by authors on
preintervention and postintervention data, mean change data, and adverse event data, were
extracted independently by multiple observers following PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS Thirty-six trials were eligible, including 6778 participants (3484 [51.4%] female;
mean [SD] age, 12.9 [5.1] years); 17 studies for DD, 10 for AD, 8 for OCD, and 1 for PTSD.
Analysis showed that SSRIs and SNRIs were significantly more beneficial compared with
placebo, yielding a small effect size (g = 0.32; 95% CI, 0.25-0.40; P < .001). Anxiety disorder
(g = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.40-0.72; P < .001) showed significantly larger between-group effect
sizes than DD (g = 0.20; 95% CI, 0.13-0.27; P < .001). This difference was driven primarily by
the placebo response: patients with DD exhibited significantly larger placebo responses
(g = 1.57; 95% CI, 1.36-1.78; P < .001) compared with those with AD (g = 1.03; 95% CI,
0.84-1.21; P < .001). The SSRIs produced a relatively large effect size for ADs (g = 0.71; 95%
CI, 0.45-0.97; P < .001). Compared with participants receiving placebo, patients receiving an
antidepressant reported significantly more treatment-emergent adverse events (RR, 1.07;
95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P = .01 or RR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.22-1.82; P < .001, depending on the reporting
method), severe adverse events (RR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.34-2.32; P < .001), and study
discontinuation due to adverse events (RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.38-2.32; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Compared with placebo, SSRIs and SNRIs are more beneficial
than placebo in children and adolescents; however, the benefit is small and disorder specific,
yielding a larger drug-placebo difference for AD than for other conditions. Response to
placebo is large, especially in DD. Severe adverse events are significantly more common with
SSRIs and SNRIs than placebo.

epressive disorders (DDs), anxiety disorders (ADs), ob-
sessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and posttrau-
matic stress disorder (PTSD) are among the most com-
mon mental disorders in children and adolescents.1 They are
major public health concerns and predict long-term risk for
various adverse outcomes.2 Thus, early diagnosis and proper
treatment is of critical importance. Selective serotonin reup-
take inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line pharmaceutical treat-
ments for these disorders, whereas serotonin-norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are considered second- or
third-line treatments, given the limited available trial data to
support their use.3 This meta-analysis compares the differen-
tial efficacy of these drugs across the disorders for which they
are primarily prescribed in a pediatric population and also as-
sessesdifferencesinresponsetoplaceboandinadverseevents.
Since the release of fluoxetine hydrochloride in the mid-
1980s, the number of SSRIs and SNRIs has grown substan-
tially. However, their use in children and adolescents is still de-
bated,thusindicatinganeedformoreresearchintotheirsafety
and efficacy and the comparative efficacy of the newer SNRIs
vs SSRIs.4 Recent meta-analyses generate many questions
about the overall benefits vs costs of using SSRIs to treat ma-
jor depression in children and adolescents.5 The small amount
of research on SNRIs for pediatric DD has had mixed results.3
One meta-analysis on pediatric depression found that, al-
though SSRIs differed significantly from placebo, SNRIs and
tricyclic antidepressants did not.6
Although most prior reviews and meta-analyses of the ef-
fects of SSRIs and SNRIs focused on pediatric DD, consider-
able data also exist on pediatric AD and OCD. The latter stud-
ies suggest that most SSRIs have a favorable risk-benefit ratio,
whereas there are insufficient data for the remaining SSRIs.3
There have been relatively few studies on SNRIs for pediatric
AD, despite the fact that the only US Food and Drug Adminis-
tration (FDA)–approved agent for pediatric AD, duloxetine hy-
drochloride, is an SNRI. To our knowledge, no double-blind,
randomized clinical trials of SNRIs for pediatric OCD had been
conducted as of 2016, and limited data have been reported for
SSRIs and SNRIs in pediatric PTSD.7
Research on safety and tolerability indicates a high risk of
developing treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)—
most prominently headache and nausea—during treatment
with an antidepressant in pediatric DD.6 Severe adverse events
(SAEs), such as an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and be-
havior, in adults and youth receiving antidepressants have also
beenreported,8leadingtotheimplementationofaboxedwarn-
ing on the labels of all antidepressants for pediatric use by the
FDA in 2004, although adoption of the warning remains
controversial.9 In addition, to date no recent meta-analyses
have focused on how pediatric adverse effect profiles of SSRIs,
SNRIs, and placebo might differ across disorders.
Finally,thereisagrowingbodyofliteratureconcerningthe
role of placebo effects in studies of SSRIs and SNRIs, based on
large placebo responses in studies of antidepressants in both
adult and pediatric samples.10 Factors such as contact with re-
search staff may lead to large placebo response rates in pedi-
atric DD11 and may explain much of the variability in pediatric
antidepressant trials.12 For adults with DD, a genuine placebo
effect has been demonstrated, as the combination of placebo
and supportive care has been shown to be more beneficial than
supportive care alone.13 Conversely, patients in the placebo
groupalsodemonstrateTEAEs.6However,howresponsetopla-
cebo differs across disorders or other study design features in
pediatrics remains understudied.

Methods
Search Strategy and Study Selection
The study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA
statement.16,17WesearchedPubMed,EMBASE,PsycInfo,Coch-
rane, and Web of Science from inception until August 7, 2016;
clinicaltrials.gov; and fda.gov and checked references of the
included studies as well as previous reviews. Additional in-
formation on search terms is presented in the eAppendix 1 in
the Supplement. In total, this search returned 4899 articles
(eFigure1intheSupplement).Thescreeningandselectionpro-
cess was conducted independently by 3 of us (C.L., H.K., and
S.R.Z.). We included randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled trials of SSRIs and SNRIs in children and adoles-
cents younger than 18 years, including studies that examined
Key Points
Question Is there a scientific justification to prescribe selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors for children and adolescents, based on what is
known about their efficacy and safety?
Findings In a systematic review and meta-analysis including 36
trials (6778 participants), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were
significantly more beneficial compared with placebo in treating
common pediatric psychiatric disorders, yet also led to
significantly more treatment-emergent and severe adverse
events, such as suicide ideation and suicide attempts, as well as
study discontinuation due to adverse events. The magnitude of
the effect and adverse event profiles were disorder dependent.
Meaning There is some evidence for the benefit of selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitors in children and adolescents, but owing to the
higher risk for severe adverse events, a cautious and individual
cost-benefit analysis is of importance.

 drug vs placebo, both in the context of a psychosocial inter-
vention, in which case the combination group was extracted
only if no comparison of drug and placebo alone was given.

Comorbiditywasallowed,andinformationaboutcomorbiddis-
orders was extracted.
Case reports, comments, letters, gray literature, and re-
views were excluded. Non–second-generation antidepres-
sants (eg, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepres-
sants) were also excluded.18 Boston Children’s Hospital
provided approval for the study.
Methodologic Quality Assessment
Twoofus(C.L.andS.R.Z.)independentlyratedthequalityofin-
cluded studies based on the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment
Tool,19withfinalqualityratingsbasedonconsensus.Riskofbias
was assessed in individual studies (eTable 1 in the Supplement)
and across studies (eFigure 2 in the Supplement).
Outcome Measures and Data Extraction
The primary outcome as defined by authors was chosen as the
soleoutcomemeasureforeachstudy.Preinterventionandpost-
intervention data or mean change data had to be available.
Outcomes had to be reported on a well-validated, disorder-
specific scale (eg, Children's Depression Rating Scale–
Revised, Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children, and
Children'sYale-BrownObsessiveCompulsiveScale)oronagen-
eral severity scale (ie, Clinical Global Impression–Severity
Scale). We included only continuous outcome data, since di-
chotomizing continuous scores into categorical outcome data
leads to a loss of information, reduces power, and creates an
artificial boundary.20,21 We did not extract data from improve-
ment scales, such as the Clinical Global Impression-Global Im-
provement Scale. Repeated attempts were made to contact the
authors of studies with incomplete or insufficient data. Two
studies22,23 did not include SDs or SEs, and they were im-
puted by way of the leaving-1-out method.24
Data were extracted independently by 3 of us (C.L., H.K.,
and S.R.Z.). Discrepancies were resolved by consensus. Ex-
tracteddataincludeddemographicinformation,dropoutrates,
adverse events, safety information, and baseline and end point
assessment points. Data from open-label extensions or fol-
low-up after the predesignated end point were not extracted.
Statistical Analysis
Threeeffectsizeswerecalculatedforeachincludedstudy.First,
drug-placebo difference response was assessed as the differ-
ence in mean change scores between the antidepressants and
placebo. The drug and placebo responses were assessed as the
mean change scores of preanalyses vs postanalyses in the drug
and placebo groups, respectively. Effect sizes were calcu-
lated as Hedges g.25 We chose to use random-effects models
rather than fixed-effects models because the studies that we
included were heterogeneous and the number of studies for
the subanalyses were relatively small.26 Heterogeneity was as-
sessed by calculating the Q statistic,27 the τ2, and the I2, a trans-
formation of Q that indicates the proportion of observed vari-
ance that can be attributed to heterogeneity rather than
sampling error.28 The τ2 offers an estimate of the variance
among true effect sizes.29 Effect size differences between sub-
groups were analyzed using a mixed-effects model.30 Publi-
cation bias was assessed visually by means of funnel plots31
and formally by means of the fail-safe N32 and the Begg ad-
justed-rank correlation test.33 We estimated the sensitivity of
publication bias, using the trim-and-fill method.34
Moderatoranalyseswereconductedfor6continuousmod-
erators (treatment duration, publication year, illness duration,
age of onset, number of sites, and baseline severity) and 4 cat-
egorical moderators (placebo lead-in, comorbidity, region, and
primary funding source). Details of the applied statistical ap-
proaches are provided in eAppendix 2 in the Supplement.
To evaluate the risk of adverse events in the antidepres-
sant and placebo groups, risk ratios (RRs) for TEAEs, SAEs, and
study discontinuation due to adverse events across trials were
calculated in a random-effects model. The RRs of SAEs were
based on the percentage of patients with SAEs. Regarding RRs
of TEAEs, 2 commonly used reporting methods were com-
pared: percentage of patients with TEAEs in each group and
mean number of TEAEs per patient across all reported symp-
toms. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis, version 3 (Biostat) and
R, version 3.2.1 (R Foundation) were used for calculations and
analyses.
Results
Our search identified 35 published and 1 unpublished random-
ized, double-blind trials7,22,23,35-67 including 6778 partici-
pants(3484[51.4%]female;mean[SD]age,12.9[5.1]years)that
compared an SSRI or an SNRI against placebo in patients
younger than 18 years with a diagnosis of AD (n = 10), DD
(n = 17), OCD (n = 8), or PTSD (n = 1) (eFigure 1 in the Supple-
ment). One study reported 2 trials that were treated indepen-
dently for analyses55 and another compared a drug plus psy-
chosocial intervention group vs a placebo plus psychosocial
intervention group and was therefore excluded from the drug
and placebo response analyses.59 Characteristics of the 36 in-
cluded trials are presented in eTable 1 in the Supplement, and
details regarding heterogeneity and publication bias can be
found in the eTable 2, eAppendix 3, eFigure 2, and eFigure 3
in the Supplement.

In the between-group analysis stratified by drug cat-
egory, SSRIs and SNRIs did not differ significantly in the DD
group (Q = 0.431; P = .51), but SSRIs were significantly better
than SNRIs in the AD group (Q = 4.161; P = .04). No studies in-
vestigated the use of SNRIs in OCD.
The within-drug group analysis stratified by disorder
yielded no significant difference (P = .07) between studies of
AD (g = 1.68; CI, 1.56-1.79; P < .001) and DD (g = 1.85; 95% CI,
1.7-2.0; P < .001), yet both yielded significantly larger drug
responses (P < .001) than studies of OCD (g = 1.01; 95% CI,
0.88-1.14; P < .001). When stratified by drug, duloxetine
yielded the largest response (g = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.73-2.18;
P < .001) and fluvoxamine the smallest response (g = 1.22;
95% CI, 0.41-2.02; P = .003); however, the difference
between those 2 drugs was not significant (Q = 3.021;
P = .08). The combined analysis across all disorders for the
within-group analysis yielded a drug response of g = 1.65
(95% CI, 1.52-1.78; P < .001). The SSRIs and SNRIs did not
differ significantly in both the DD group (Q = 2.351; P = .13)
and the AD group (Q = 0.341; P = .56).

Twenty-six trials reported the percentage of patients with
TEAEs (reporting method 1), 26 trials reported the mean num-
ber of TEAEs per patient across symptoms (reporting method
2), and 15 trials reported both reporting methods. The 2 re-
porting methods differed significantly (across all 52 trials:
P = .002; within the 15 studies reporting both reporting meth-
ods: P = .045), indicating higher RRs with reporting method

cebo. No significant differences in TEAEs or SAEs were found
between SSRIs and SNRIs. The RRs for TEAEs stratified by drug
and disorder are displayed in Table 1. Discontinuation of treat-
ment due to adverse events was significantly more common
in the antidepressant group compared with the placebo group
(RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.38-2.32; P < .001). The RRs for study dis-
continuation and SAEs stratified by drug and disorder are sum-
marized in Table 2. Mean rates of TEAEs, SAEs, and study dis-
continuation can be found in eTable 3 in the Supplement.
Moderator Analysis
Univariate analyses indicated larger effect sizes as a function
for earlier trials, fewer sites, longer illness duration, and non-
industry funding. However, none of the moderators was found
to be significant in a multivariate meta-regression (eAppen-
dix 3 and eTables 4-6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Our meta-analysis addresses the response and safety profile
of SNRIs, SSRIs, and placebo in pediatric DD, AD, OCD, and
PTSD. Results indicate that SSRIs and SNRIs are more benefi-
cial than placebo in treating these commonly diagnosed con-
ditions in children and adolescents. However, the overall drug-
placebo difference is small and varies significantly by disorder,
with a larger response in AD than DD, especially for SSRIs
(g = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.45-0.97; P < .001). This difference in drug-
placebo difference response is mainly due to a higher placebo
response in pediatric DD. Furthermore, patients with OCD ex-
hibit a significantly smaller response to both drug treatment
and placebo treatment compared with AD and DD.
The small effect size between SSRIs and SNRIs vs placebo
in pediatric DD might be owing to the lack of a clear depres-
sion phenotype. This was apparent in DSM-5 field trials on ma-
jor depressive disorder (MDD), which found a low test-retest
reliability(κ = 0.28)forchildren,adolescents,andadults.68Fur-
thermore, there is high comorbidity between pediatric DD and
other disorders, especially AD. A recent review on the use of
SSRIs and SNRIs in pediatric populations reported that ap-
proximately 25% of patients with MDD had a comorbid AD.3
In our meta-analysis, although not all included studies re-
ported comorbidity rates, those doing so reported comorbid-
ity rates in AD ranging between 6% and 56% in patients with
DD. Yet, attempts by the DSM-5 work group to create a “mixed
anxiety and depression disorder” resulted in an unaccept-
able rate of test-retest reliability (κ = −0.004) when tested in
the DSM-5 field trials.68

Because there was only 1 study, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was not
included in subgroup analyses. Responses to selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRIs) were significantly larger in depressive disorders (DDs) and
anxiety disorders (ADs) compared with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
(both P < .001). The placebo response was significantly larger in DDs compared
with ADs (P < .001) and OCD (P < .001) and significantly larger in ADs compared
with OCD (P < .002). SNRI indicates serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.

respond to pharmacologic treatment to the same degree as
those with DD, do not appear to exhibit such a robust placebo

 response. While in line with older reviews in children,69 this
finding is in contrast to adult studies that found no signifi-
cant differences in placebo effect size between depression and
anxiety.70 This contrast is not unique: placebo responses be-
tween children and adults differ significantly for binary out-
comes across a wide variety of diseases.71 One explanation
might be that children and adolescents with major DD may be
more demoralized than patients with AD and are therefore
more sensitive to changes in hope and favorable meanings.69
However, because no pediatric trial included a no-treatment
arm that could serve as a control for the natural course of the
disorders, the difference in placebo response may also reflect
differences in the probability of spontaneous improvement be-
tween the 2 pediatric disorders rather than differences in the
placebo effect. Owing to the small number of studies in chil-
dren, we could not estimate the drug and placebo response for
the individual ADs, yet a recent adult study found drug and
placebo effect sizes to be roughly equivalent across ADs.72 In
pediatric patients, however, those with panic disorder seem
to experience a greater placebo response compared with pa-
tients with generalized AD or social phobia.73
Our results are very similar to those of a recent meta-
analysis of 5 decades of research on youth psychological
therapy,74 which found that mean effect sizes at posttreat-
mentwerestrongestforAD(g = 0.61),weakestforDD(g = 0.29),
and nonsignificant for multiproblem treatment (g = 0.15), in-
dicating a general difficulty in establishing a clinically rel-
evantbenefitinthetreatmentofpediatricdepression.Thesub-
stantial placebo response in MDD indicates that depressed
children and adolescents might benefit from innovative treat-
ment modalities that harness the power of the placebo effect
in an ethical fashion, including clinician contact11 and other
common factors, such as the patients’ expectations of im-
provement, their desire for relief, and the exposure to treat-
ment rituals. Placebo response also offers several implica-
tions for research design in antidepressant trials. Alternative
designs, such as a discontinuation design75 or n-of-1 trials,76,77
might be recommended when establishing efficacy,78 yet also
have their individual shortcomings.79 Differences between 2
medication groups could provide information about the
magnitude of expectancy effects. In this regard, response and
remission rates to antidepressants have been shown to be sig-
nificantly higher in comparator trials compared with placebo-
controlled trials.80 Future instructive studies could incorpo-
rate designs in which people who respond to placebo continue
to receive placebo.
With regard to adverse events, our finding that patients re-
ceiving any antidepressant reported more TEAEs, SAEs, and
study discontinuation compared with those receiving pla-
cebo is in line with other meta-analyses reporting increased
suicidality (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.31- 4.33),81 suicidal ide-
ation, and suicide attempts (risk difference: antidepressant vs
placebo, 0.7%; 95% CI, 0.1%-1.3%)14 in children and adoles-
cents receiving SSRIs and SNRIs compared with placebo. This
finding is mainly due to the large amount of significant SSRI
studies, although patients receiving SNRIs reported signifi-
cantly more SAEs than did those receiving placebo. Thus, our
results support concerns about the safety of antidepressants
in children and adolescents. Evaluating the mean number of
adverseeventsprovidesamoresensitivemeasurethantheper-
centageofpatientsexhibitingatleast1adverseeventandmight
be recommended as the primary reporting method in future
clinical trials.
Limitations
Our study has some limitations. First, none of the random-
ized clinical trials included directly compared effectiveness
acrossdisorders.Accordingly,wecouldonlymakeindirectcon-
clusions with regard to disorder specificity. Second, although
our meta-analysis included unpublished trials, reporting bias
could lead to an overly positive representation of findings in
theliterature.82Inthisregard,manyconcernshavebeenraised
about the accuracy of the data of 1 study in particular: Paxil
Study 329. A reanalysis of the original data found that parox-
etine did not show efficacy for MDD in adolescents and that
the initial study underplayed the drug’s potential to increase
suicidal thoughts among adolescents.83 Third, there was vari-
ability in the mean age and age distribution between studies,
which may have had an effect on results. Response to SSRIs
and SNRIs has been shown to be lower in children than in ado-
lescents, in part related to a higher placebo response in
children.14 Fourth, the Begg and Eggers tests31,33 used to as-
sess publication bias are valid only when there are 10 or more
studies being evaluated, and our OCD group consisted of only
8 trials. However, no evidence of publication bias was found
in the respective funnel plot. The different reporting meth-
ods of adverse events led to subgroup analyses based on only
a few studies and should therefore be considered prelimi-
nary, requiring further investigation. Furthermore, restric-
tive inclusion criteria of clinical trials, such as noninclusion of
comorbidity and a higher symptom severity threshold, make
it difficult to generalize results to real-world populations.84
Finally, because only 1 study met our inclusion criteria for
PTSD,7 no categorical analysis of SSRIs and SNRIs for the treat-
ment of pediatric PTSD was possible.
Conclusions
The main findings of this meta-analysis present multiple av-
enues for further analyses. First, the nearly identical re-
sponse rate for pediatric DD and AD deserves further investi-
gation and perhaps the revision of federal prescribing
guidelines for these 2 conditions. Although several SSRIs and
SNRIs have been approved for the treatment of pediatric DD
and OCD, only 1—duloxetine—has recently received FDA ap-
proval for treatment of pediatric ADs.85 Second, the substan-
tial differential response to both drug treatment and placebo
treatment in OCD compared with AD and DD highlights un-
derlying differences in the etiologies and pathogeneses of the
disorders that may require additional interventions for pedi-
atric patients with OCD.86 It is our hope that a research do-
main criteria approach87 will help to elucidate the above-
mentionedpointsandcouldleadtobettertreatmentoutcomes.
Third, additional research into the factors that moderate the
efficacy of SSRIs and SNRIs in children is warranted, as is the

 need for more comprehensive reporting of population and ill-
ness details (eg, age at onset, duration of illness) in clinical and
pragmatic trials. Finally, the significant variability in the as-
sessment and reporting of adverse events highlights the need
for a standardized method of reporting TEAEs and SAEs. Given
the potential for life-threatening events in young children and
adolescents, understanding the extent to which these medi-
cations pose a genuine risk to youth is urgent. This need would
allow future research to deviate from the current line of stud-
