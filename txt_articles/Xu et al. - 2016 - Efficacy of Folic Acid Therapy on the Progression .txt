IMPORTANCE The efficacy of folic acid therapy on renal outcomes has not been previously
investigated in populations without folic acid fortification.
OBJECTIVE To test whether treatment with enalapril and folic acid is more effective in slowing
renal function decline than enalapril alone across a spectrum of renal function at baseline
from normal to moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) among Chinese adults with
hypertension.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this substudy of eligible China Stroke Primary
Prevention Trial (CSPPT), 15 104 participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater, including 1671 patients with CKD, were recruited from
20 communities in Jiangsu province in China.
INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomized to receive a single tablet daily containing
10 mg enalapril and 0.8 mg folic acid (n = 7545) or 10 mg enalapril alone (n = 7559).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the progression of CKD, defined
as a decrease in eGFR of 30% or more and to a level of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 if the
baseline eGFR was 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or more, or a decrease in eGFR of 50% or more if the
baseline eGFR was less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2; or end-stage renal disease. Secondary
outcomes included a composite of the primary outcome and all-cause death, rapid decline in
renal function, and rate of eGFR decline.
RESULTS Overall, 15 104 Chinese adults with a mean (range) age of 60 (45-75) years were
recruited; median follow-up was 4.4 years. There were 164 and 132 primary events in the
enalapril group and the enalapril–folic acid group, respectively. Compared with the enalapril
group, the enalapril–folic acid group had a 21% reduction in the odds of the primary event
(odds ratio [OR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62-1.00) and a slower rate of eGFR decline (1.28% vs 1.42%
per year; P = .02). Among the participants with CKD at baseline, folic acid therapy resulted in
a significant reduction in the risks for the primary event (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-0.75), rapid
decline in renal function (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.96) and the composite event (OR, 0.62;
95% CI, 0.43-0.90), and a 44% slower decline in renal function (0.96% vs 1.72% per year,
P < .001). Among those without CKD at baseline, there was no between-group difference in
the primary end point.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Enalapril–folic acid therapy, compared with enalapril alone,
can significantly delay the progression of CKD among patients with mild-to-moderate CKD.

C
hronic kidney disease (CKD) is a worldwide public
healthproblemleadingtopooroutcomesandhighcost;1
CKD substantially increases the risk of progression to
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and cardiovascular disease
(CVD).2,3 It is estimated that more than 119 million Chinese
people have CKD and are at high risk of developing ESRD.4
Antihypertensive therapy, especially aimed at inhibiting the
renin-angiotensin system, remains the mainstay of treat-
ment for slowing down renal function decline.5 However, de-
spite treatment, the number of patients with ESRD and treated
with renal replacement therapy continues to increase.6,7 New
therapeutic interventions that slow down the decline in renal
function in patients with CKD are critically needed.
The high prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia in pa-
tients with CKD has generated interest in a potential role for
hyperhomocysteinemia as a risk factor for progression of
CKD.8,9 Although epidemiologic studies have shown that
hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with the risk of devel-
oping albuminuria and CKD,10,11 interventional studies using
high doses of folic acid and B vitamins including cyanocobala-
min,conductedinpopulationswithfolicacidfortification,have
shown no benefit or harmful effects on renal outcomes.12,13
Previous studies have suggested that folic acid fortification
could be a major modifier for the efficacy of folic acid therapy
on cardiovascular disease and stroke.14-18 However, no study
to date has evaluated the efficacy of folic acid therapy with-
out cyanocobalamin on renal outcomes in a population
without folic acid fortification.
The China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial (CSPPT) com-
pared the efficacy of combination of the angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril and folic acid with enal-
april alone in reducing the risk of first stroke in Chinese adults
with hypertension.16 This report, a prespecified renal sub-
study of the CSPPT, sought to examine the effects of combi-
nation of enalapril and folic acid with enalapril alone in re-
ducing the risk of renal function decline in a hypertensive
population.Theuniqueaspectsofthisstudyarethatitwascon-
ducted in a population without folic acid fortification, that it
included participants across a spectrum of renal function at
baseline from normal to moderate CKD, and that cyanocobala-
min was not used in the therapy.
Methods
Study Design
The rationale and study design for the CSPPT has been de-
scribed in detail previously.16 Briefly, the CSPPT was a ran-
domized, double-blind, actively controlled trial conducted
fromMay2008toAugust2013in32communitiesinAnhuiand
JiangsuprovincesofChina.Thestudyenrolledatotalof20 702
adults with hypertension and without a history of major CVD.
Participants were randomized to receive treatment with either
a combination of enalapril and folic acid or enalapril alone and
followed up for a median of 4.5 years.
Thesubstudyofrenaloutcomeswasdesignedtoinvestigate
the effects of folic acid on the progression of CKD in adults
with hypertension. The ethics committee of the Institute of
Biomedicine, Anhui Medical University and the medical ethics
committee of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University
approved the renal substudy, and informed consent for the re-
nal substudy was waived. For trial protocol, see Supplement 1.
Participants, Intervention, and Follow-up
Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria for the CSPPT trial are
described elsewhere.16 The renal substudy enrolled eligible
CSPPT participants from the communities in Jiangsu prov-
ince, excluding those with an estimated glomerular filtration
rate (eGFR) of less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 or a missing eGFR
at baseline. The flowchart of the participants (CONSORT
diagram) is presented in eFigure 1 in Supplement 2.
Participants were randomized to receive a daily oral dose
of 1 tablet containing 10 mg enalapril and 0.8 mg folic acid
(single pill combination; the enalapril–folic acid group) or
1 tablet containing 10 mg enalapril only (the enalapril group).
Other classes of antihypertensive medications, mostly
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and hydrochloro-
thiazide, could be prescribed concomitantly if necessary.
Participantswerefollowedupevery3months.Ateachvisit,
the blood pressures and pulses of the participants were mea-
sured, the numbers of pills taken between visits were counted,
and concomitant medications and adverse events were re-
corded. Before the study ended, an exit visit was conducted
for collection of serum and urine samples and assessment of
renal outcomes.
Laboratory Assays
Serum and spot urine samples from the participants were
collected at both the baseline and the exit visit. Serum creati-
nine,totalhomocysteine,lipids,andfastingglucoseweremea-
sured using automatic clinical analyzers (Beckman Coulter) at
the core laboratory of the National Clinical Research Center for
Kidney Disease, Guangzhou, China. Specifically, serum cre-
atinine was measured using an enzymatic assay that has been
calibrated to be isotope dilution mass spectrometry trace-
able. The coefficient of variation for the assay was 1.4%. Esti-
mated GFR was calculated using the Chronic Kidney Disease
Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equation.19 Protein-
uria was determined using a dipstick test (Dirui-H100).
Key Points
Question Is folic acid therapy effective in delaying the renal
function decline in patients with and without chronic kidney
disease (CKD)?
Findings In this this randomized clinical trial of 15 104 patients
(1671 with CKD), folic acid therapy reduced the risk of progression
of CKD and the rate of estimated glomerular filtration rate decline.
Patients with CKD benefited more from the therapy, with a 56%
and 44% reduction in the risk for progression of CKD and the rate
of eGFR decline, respectively.
Meaning Folic acid therapy should be considered for the clinical
management of CKD, particularly in regions without folic acid
fortification.

Outcomes
The primary outcome was progression of CKD, defined as a
decrease in eGFR of 30% or more and to a level of less than
60 mL/min/1.73m2 at the exit visit if the baseline eGFR
was 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or more, or a decrease in eGFR of
50% or more at the exit visit if the baseline eGFR was less
than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or end-stage renal disease
(eGFR<15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or need for dialysis).20
Thesecondaryoutcomesincludedthefollowing:(1)acom-
posite outcome of the primary outcome and all-cause death;
(2) rapid decline in renal function, defined as an average de-
cline in eGFR of 5 mL/min/1.73 m2 or more per year; and
(3) annual rate of relative decline in eGFR, estimated as
 eGFR at baseline

wheretisthetimelengthinyearsfrombaselinetotheexitvisit.
Other Definitions
Participants with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and/or
proteinuria at baseline were classified as having CKD. Diabe-
tes was defined as having a history of diabetes or a fasting glu-
cose 7 mmol/L (to convert mmol/L to mg/dL, divide by 0.0555)
or more at baseline or under glucose-lowering therapy. The
treatmentcompliancewascalculatedasthepercentageofdays
taking the study medication during the trial. Regular concomi-
tant medication was defined as 180 or more cumulative days
taking the drug of interest.
Statistical Analyses
Participants with unknown renal outcomes (n = 2187 [14%])
were excluded from the renal outcome analysis. Participants
who were alive at the exit visit with unknown renal outcomes
(n = 1802 [12%]) were excluded from the composite outcome
analysis. There were also missing values on serum total cho-
lesterol (n = 1), body mass index (BMI [calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared], n = 3), smok-
ing status (n = 6), serum total homocysteine (n = 10) and fo-
late (n = 173), and proteinuria dipstick test (n = 554) at base-
line. Multiple imputation was used to deal with missing values
in the outcome analyses.
Baseline characteristics were stratified by treatment group
and presented as mean (SD) for continuous variables and count
(percentage) for categorical variables. Differences between the
treatmentgroupsfortreatmentcompliance,concomitantmedi-
cationuse,changesinserumfolateandhomocysteine,andtime-
averaged decrease in blood pressure during the trial were com-
pared and tested using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test or a
χ2test.Thetreatmenteffects,expressedasoddsratios(ORs)for
the dichotomous outcomes and between-group differences for
the eGFR decline rate, were estimated using generalized linear
regressionmodelswithadjustmentforage,sex,BMI,eGFR,pro-
teinuria, systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum glucose and total
cholesterol at baseline, as well as timed-average of SBP. The
strata-specific treatment effects in the participants with and
withoutCKDatbaselinewerealsoestimatedandcomparedun-
derthesameregressionmodels.Asadditionalexploratoryanaly-
ses, possible modifications of the treatment effects on the pri-
mary outcome in participants with CKD at baseline were also
assessed for variables including sex, MTHFR C677T genotype,
age, eGFR, presence of diabetes, and tertiles of BMI, serum
folate, and total homocysteine at baseline.
We performed analyses on the primary outcome in total,
CKD,andnon-CKDpopulations.Toadjustformultipletests,the
distribution of testwise P values under the null was obtained
empirically by permutation of the treatment assignment. For
theprimaryoutcome,atestwise2-tailedPvalueof.027wascon-
sidered statistically significant at a studywise type I error rate
of .05. All data analyses were performed using R version 3.2.0
(The R Foundation; http://www.R-project.org/).
Results
Study Participants and the Baseline Characteristics
The renal substudy included a total of 15 104 patients with hy-
pertension from the CSPPT, including 1671 (11.1%) with CKD
at baseline. Of the participants, 12 917 (85.5%) completed re-
nal outcome assessment, and 385 (2.5%) passed away before
the end of the CSPPT with unknown renal outcomes (eFigure
1 in Supplement 2). The participants with unknown out-
comes did not differ from those with complete outcome data
inbaselinecharacteristics(eTable1inSupplement2).Thebase-
line characteristics of the participants, stratified by the pres-
ence of CKD, were comparable among the 2 treatment groups
(Table 1). The age of the participants ranged from 45 to 75 years
with a mean of 60 years. The participants with CKD had higher
blood pressure, serum total homocysteine, and fasting glu-
cose than those without CKD. The prevalence of elevated se-
rum total homocysteine (>15 μmol/L) and diabetes was 42%
and24%,respectively,intheCKDgroup,ascomparedwith26%
and 12%, respectively, in the non-CKD group.
Treatment Adherence and Blood Pressure
The length of follow-up ranged from 4.0 to 4.8 years with a
median of 4.4 years. The mean treatment compliance, de-
fined as the percentage of the study medicine actually taken
during the trial, was 76% in both treatment groups.
Inthetotalstudypopulation,thetime-averagedbloodpres-
sure during the trial was 140/84 mm Hg, representing an aver-
age decrease of 28/12 mm Hg from the baseline. The drop in
bloodpressurewasslightlygreaterintheparticipantswithCKD
group than in those without. There was no significant differ-
ence in the blood pressure during the entire period of the trial
between the 2 treatment groups (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
Changes in Serum Homocysteine and Folate
The baseline serum levels of folic acid and homocysteine were
comparable between the 2 treatment groups in the total popu-
lation as well as in the CKD subgroup (Table 2). At the exit visit,
serum folate levels increased 5.1 and 15.4 ng/mL (to convert
ng/mL to nmol/L, multiply by 2.266), respectively, from the
baseline in the enalapril and the enalapril–folic acid group. As
expected, the enalapril–folic acid group had a much greater
drop in serum homocysteine than did the enalapril group (1.9
vs 0.2 μmol/L [to convert μmol/L to mg/L, divide 7.397];

P < .001). In the enalapril–folic acid group, both the size of the
increase in serum folate and the drop in homocysteine were
greaterintheparticipantswithCKDthaninthosewithoutCKD.
In particular, the greatest drop in serum homocysteine was in
TT homozygotes of MTHFR C677T polymorphism, while the
magnitude of the declines in those with CC/CT genotypes was
relatively small (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).

(2.5%) and 132 (2.1%) participants, respectively, in the enal-
april group and the enalapril–folic acid group (Table 3). Com-
pared with the enalapril group, the enalapril–folic acid group
had a 21% reduction in the adjusted risk of the primary event
(OR,0.79;95%CI,0.62-1.00),asignificantlyslowerrateofeGFR
decline (1.28% vs 1.42% per year; P = .02), and a 9% and 11%
reduction in the risk of rapid renal function decline and the
composite outcome, respectively, although the trend was not
statistically significant.
We were particularly interested in evaluating the effects
of folic acid in the participants with CKD who were at a higher
risk of renal dysfunction. Among those with CKD, the pri-
mary event occurred in 46 (6.8%) and 24 (3.3%) participants,
respectively, in the enalapril group and the enalapril–folic acid
group (Table 4). Compared with the enalapril group, the enal-
april–folic acid group had a significant reduction in the
adjusted odds of the primary event (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.26-
0.75), rapid decline in renal function (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-
0.96), and the composite event (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.43-
0.90).Treatmentwithenalapril–folicacidalsoresultedina44%
slower rate of renal function decline (0.96% vs 1.72% per year;
P < .001). In contrast, among the participants without CKD
there was little difference between the 2 treatment groups in
the effects on both the primary and the secondary outcomes.
The interaction tests indicated that the presence of CKD at
baseline was a significant modifier for the treatment effect.
Concomitant Medications
The most common concomitant medications were dihydropy-
ridine and hydrochlorothiazide, which were used in 78% and
57% of the participants, respectively (eTable 2 in Supplement
2). There were no significant differences in concomitant medi-
cations during the trial between the 2 treatment groups. Use
of other classes of antihypertensive drugs, lipid-lowering,

glucose-lowering, and antiplatelet medications were very rare,
all at a frequency of less than 2%.
Exploratory Subgroup Analyses
We further performed exploratory subgroup analysis to as-
sess the treatment effect on the primary outcome in various
subgroups among participants with CKD (Figure). A larger re-
duction in the risk of the primary event was observed in the
subgroup of baseline eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 com-
pared with that of baseline eGFR 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or more,
though the difference did not reach statistical significance
(P = .10). Other variables, including levels of serum folate and
total homocysteine, did not appear to modify the treatment
effect. It should be noted that at the existing sample size, the
power for detecting a moderate interaction in the test is quite
limited, such that a negative finding in the test would not
necessarily confirm an absence of interaction.
Discussion
We found that treatment with enalapril–folic acid, as com-
pared with enalapril alone, reduced the risk of progression of
CKD by 21% and the rate of eGFR decline by 10% in hyperten-
sive patients. More importantly, the presence of CKD at base-
line was a significant modifier of the treatment effect (P for in-
teraction = .02). Patients with CKD benefited most from the
folic acid therapy, with a 56% and 44% reduction in the risk
for progression of CKD and the rate of eGFR decline, respec-
tively. In contrast, the renal protective effect in those without
CKD was nominal.
Blood pressure control is essential to slow down the pro-
gression of CKD.21,22 In our study, blood pressures, treatment
compliance, and the use of other conventional antihyperten-
sive drugs remained comparable between the 2 treatment
groups across all stages of the trial. We also adjusted for base-
line SBP, timed-average of SBP, and other possible confound-
ers in our outcome analysis. Therefore, the beneficial effect
of the enalapril–folic acid therapy that we observed could not
be attributed to differences in blood pressure control through-
out the study. Moreover, because of the low vascular disease
burden and low frequency of vascular protective medication
use in the study population, our results are unlikely to be
affected by possible drug interactions.23,24
Our study is the first to show significant renal protection
from folic acid therapy in a population without folic acid for-

tification. In contrast, previous trials have reported a null or
harmful effect of supplementation with folic acid and B vita-
mins including cyanocobalamin.12,13 The HOST study13 re-
ported that treatment with high doses of folic acid (40 mg/d)
and other B vitamins (vitamin B6, 100 mg/d; vitamin B12,
2 mg/d) did not improve survival or delay the time to initiat-
ing dialysis in patients with advanced CKD or ESRD.13 The
DIVINe trial12 showed that, compared with placebo, treat-
ment with folic acid (2.5 mg/d) and B vitamins (vitamin B6,
25 mg/d; cyanocobalamin, 1 mg/d) resulted in a greater de-
crease in GFR and an increase in vascular events in 238 pa-
tients with diabetic nephropathy. This discrepancy may be
partly explained by differences in patient characteristics and
treatment schemes among these studies. First, baseline folic
acid levels may have an impact on the effectiveness of the fo-
licacidtherapy.Ourstudywasconductedinapopulationwith-
outgrainfortificationoffolicacidwhiletheother2studieswere
undertaken in regions with folic acid fortification. The mean
baseline serum folate was 7.7 ng/mL in our study, much lower
than the means of 15 to approximately 16.5 ng/mL in the HOST
andtheDIVINestudies.TheCSPPTstudyhaspreviouslyshown
that folic acid therapy can reduce the risk of stroke with a sig-
nificantly larger effect size in those with lower serum folate
at baseline.16 Second, our study participants were those with
mild-to-moderate CKD, while the HOST study enrolled pa-
tients with advanced CKD or ESRD. It is possible that the un-
derlying burden of disease in the HOST study was too great to
produce a measurable benefit from a folic acid supplementa-
tion; the beneficial effect of folic acid therapy may be most
evident in patients with mild-to-moderate CKD. Third, un-
like the other 2 studies, our study used a low dose of folic acid
(0.8 mg/d) without combination with other B vitamins. After
treatment, mean serum folate rose to 23 ng/mL in our study
as compared with more than 2000 ng/mL in the HOST study.13
At such a high level, much of the folate in the blood would be
unmetabolized folic acid, of which the pharmacological ef-
fects on renal and vascular events have not yet been
characterized.25 Moreover, the renal protective effect might be
offset by the toxic effects associated with pharmacological
doses of B vitamins. Our findings support the hypothesis that
a high dose of cyanocobalamin, which was administered
together with folic acid, might be the culprit of the renal
adverse outcomes observed in the DIVINe study.12,26,27
Inadequate folate intake is prevalent in most countries
without mandatory folic acid fortification, including China
and other developing countries. In our exploratory analysis,
we found that baseline folate did not modify the effect of
folic acid on progression of CKD. However, the highest tertile
of serum folate level (>8.47 ng/mL) was still very low. In
addition, the sample size of our study was not large enough
to detect a moderate interaction effect. Whether the renal
protective effect of folic acid that we observed could be
extrapolated to populations with higher folate levels will
require further verification.
Several limitations are worth mentioning. This was a sub-
study of the CSPPT trial. The renal function of the study par-
ticipants was only assessed at baseline and the exit visit. More
frequent renal function assays would allow for a more accu-
rate assessment of change in renal function over time. In ad-
dition, 12% of the participants had incomplete outcome data
and were excluded from the analysis. However, the baseline
characteristics were fairly balanced among the 2 treatment
groups and those who dropped out, which should have alle-
viatedthebias.Furthermore,weperformedasensitivityanaly-
sis using a composite outcome that included both the pri-
mary outcome and all-cause death and confirmed a significant
renal protection effect from the folic acid therapy. Owing to
the study limitations, confirmation of our findings in an inde-
pendent population without folic acid fortification is badly
needed.
Conclusions
Enalapril–folic acid therapy compared with enalapril alone
significantly slowed down the progression of CKD in patients
with hypertension with mild-to-moderate CKD. The number
needed to treat was 29. Given the magnitude of renal protec-
tion suggested by this study as well as the safety and the low
cost, the potential role of folic acid therapy in the clinical man-
agement of patients with CKD in regions without folic acid
fortification should be vigorously examined.
