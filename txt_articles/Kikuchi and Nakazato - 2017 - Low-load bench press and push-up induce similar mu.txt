Aim: To investigate the effect of push-up training with a similar load of to 40% of 1- repetition max-
imumal (1RM) bench press on muscle hypertrophy and strength gain in men.
Methods: Eighteen male participants (age, 20.2 ± 0.73 years, range: 19�22 years, height: 169.8 ± 4.4 cm,
weight: 64.5 ± 4.7 kg) were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups: bench press at 40%
1RM (bench-press group, n ¼ 9) or push-ups with position adjusted (e.g. kneeling) to the same load of
bench-press 40%1RM (push-up group, n ¼ 9), performed twice per week for 8 weeks. Muscle thickness at
three sites (biceps, triceps, and pectoralis major), bench-press 1RM, maximum repetition at 40%1RM, and
power output (medicine ball throw) were measured before and after the training period.
Results: Significant increases in 1RM and muscle thickness (triceps and pectoralis major) were observed
in bench-press group (1RM, from 60.0 ± 12.1 kg to 65.0 ± 12.1 kg, p < 0.01; triceps, from 26.3 ± 3.7 mm to
27.8 ± 3.8 mm, p < 0.01; pectoralis major, from 17.0 ± 2.8 mm to 20.8 ± 4.8 mm, p < 0.01) and in the
push-up group (1RM, from 61.1 ± 12.2 kg to 64.2 ± 12.5 kg, p < 0.01; triceps, 27.7 ± 5.7 mm to 30.4 ± 6.6
mm, p < 0.01; pectoralis major, from 17.0 ± 2.8 mm to 20.8 ± 4.8 mm, p < 0.01). Biceps thickness
significantly increased only in the bench-press group (28.4 ± 3.3 mm to 31.5 ± 3.7 mm, p < 0.01). Neither
power output performance nor muscle endurance capacity changed in either group.
Conclusions: Push-up exercise with similar load to 40%1RM bench press is comparably effective for
muscle hypertrophy and strength gain over an 8-week training period.

1. Introduction
The push-up is a very popular bodyweight-based strength
training exercise for fitness in athletes and general populations.1e4
The push-up can be performed without any additional tools, and its
intensity can be altered with several variations, making it suitable
for almost every level of fitness.5,6 In addition, “bodyweight
training” was selected the top 3 fitness trend in the past consecu-
tive 3 years of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
trend words in 2015 to 2017.7 Although the push-up exercise is
undoubtedly useful and important, chronic adaptations to push-
ups, particularly muscle hypertrophy, remain unclear.
Strength training load is usually determined relative to one
repetition maximum (1RM), and the training load for muscle hy-
pertrophy is typically set to more than 70%1RM.8 A recent study
suggested that low-intensity strength training such as 30% 1RM
induced muscle gain, if it was performed to failure.9 A meta-
analysis of randomized controlled studies to compare the effects
of low-load versus high-load training for improving muscle
strength and muscle development suggested that low-load resis-
tance training led to similar muscle gain compared with high-load
resistance training, but a lower tendency for strength gain was
observed with low-load training.10
Bench press and push-up have been shown to elicit similar
muscle activation patterns on electromyography.1,11 Calatayud et al.
reported that the elastic-resistance push-up exercise and bench
press induced similar EMG values, as well as similar strength gains
when both exercises were performed at the same intensity and
speed of movement over 6 weeks, thus demonstrating a relation-
ship between similar acute muscle activations and changes in

 muscle strength.12 However, to our knowledge, no studies have
investigated whether push-up training induces muscle gain similar
to that of bench-press training.
Ebben et al.5 investigated push-up variations including different
levels of foot and hand elevation and bent-knee and normal posi-
tion and observed ground reaction forces of approximately 64% and
49% of body weight in the regular and bent-knee push-up condi-
tions, respectively. Other studies reported similar results.13 These
findings indicated that the intensity of push-up exercise can be
adjusted to a suitable intensity for low-load training.
The purpose of this study was to investigate whether low-load
bench-press and push-up exercise at similar intensity (40%1RM)
performed to failure induced comparable muscle hypertrophy and
strength gain in untrained men. We hypothesized that these ex-
ercises would lead to similar muscle hypertrophy and strength gain
after an 8-week training program.
2. Methods
2.1. Study design
Subjects were randomly assigned to an experimental group:
bench press and sprint push-up group. A supervised progressive
RT program designed to induce muscular hypertrophy (40%1RM of
bench press) was performed in 8-week with training carried out 2
times per week on nonconsecutive days. Muscle thickness at three
sites (biceps brachii, triceps brachii, and pectoralis major), bench
press
1RM,
ball
throwing,
and
maximum
repetition
were
measured at 3 time points (two baseline tests and once after 8
weeks of training). Post measurements were performed at in-
tervals of 48 hours from final training session. Test-retest reli-
ability analyses revealed intra-class correlation coefficients of
0.703�0.986. Two-way ANOVA with repeated measures and
Bonferroni post hoc tests were conducted to assess the effects. All
testing and training were supervised by a National Strength and
Conditioning Association, Certified Strength and Conditioning
Specialist (NSCAeCSCS) and supervisors were blinded about the
purpose of the study.
2.2. Subjects
Eighteen collegiate male students majoring physical education
(age: 20.2 ± 0.7 years, age range: 19�22 years, height: 169.8 ± 4.4
cm, weight: 63.2 ± 6.3 kg) volunteered to participate in this study.
The subjects were recreational noncompetitive exercisers with
minimum resistance training experience of 1 year and were
randomly assigned to bench-press group (n ¼ 9 age: 20.1 ± 0.6
years, height: 171.4 ± 3.8 cm, weight: 63.3 ± 5.8 kg), push-up group
(n ¼ 9 age: 20.3 ± 0.8 years, height: 168.1 ± 4.5 cm, weight:
63.1 ± 7.2 kg). All participants were informed about the potential
risks of the experiment and gave their written consent to partici-
pate. The study was approved by the ethics committee of our
institution and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki for Human Research.
2.3. Training protocols
All training session was performed at training center in Nippon
Sport Science University, Tokyo, Japan at noon (P.M. 0:00-1:00).
Subjects were randomly assigned to the two experimental groups.
One group performed 3 sets of bench press exercise at 40% 1RM
(bench-press group, n ¼ 9), and the other performed 3 sets of push-
ups with their position adjusted to the same load, 40% 1RM, as the
bench press (push-up group, n ¼ 9) (Fig.1). The intensity of push up
group was fixed according to previous studies5,6 and repetitions of
each session. Both training groups performed the exercises to
failure with 2-min rest intervals, twice per week for 8 weeks.
Immediately after each training session, subjects consumed a
source of high-quality protein (DNS Protein,132 kcal, 24.4 g protein,
3.6 g carbohydrate, 2.3 g fat; DNS, Tokyo, Japan) in conjunction with
300 ml of water to standardize the post-exercise meal.

 One-repetition maximum test and maximum repetition test
All subjects performed the 1RM test using free-weight bench
press using methods previously described by Hoffman.14 Before the
test, subjects were given instructions on proper techniques and test
procedures. After a warm-up consisting of several sets of 6 to 10
repetitions using a light load, each participant attempted a single
repetition with a load believed to be approximately 90% of his
maximum. If the attempt was successful, weight was added,
depending on the ease with which the single repetition was
completed. If the attempt was not successful, weight was removed
from the bar, and the exercise was repeated. Participants rested for
a minimum of 3 minutes between maximal attempts. This pro-
cedure continued until the participant was unable to complete a
single repetition through the full range of motion. Each partici-
pant's 1RM was defined as the heaviest load at which the exercise
could be performed in proper form and was usually achieved in 3 to
5 attempts. Muscle endurance capacity was measured by maximal
repetition test of bench press with 40% 1RM based on recent 1RM
test. More than 24h after 1RM tests, subjects performed a warm-up
consisting of several sets of 6 to 10 repetitions using a light load,
and performed maximal effort repetition tests on the bench press
to determine the repetitions and work volumes. Attempts of 1RM
and maximal repetition test that did not meet the range of motion
criterion for each exercise, as determined by the researcher, were
discarded. The subjects were required to lower the bar to their
chest before initiating concentric movement. Their grip widths
were measured and recorded for later use. All testing was
completed under the supervision of NSCA-CSCS.
2.4. Muscle thickness
Muscle thickness was measured using B-mode ultrasound sys-
tem and software (Aloka SSD-3500, Tokyo, Japan) at three sites: the
biceps and triceps brachii at 60% of the distance from the lateral
epicondyle of the humerus to the acromial process of the scapula,
and the pectoralis major at the site between third and fourth of ribs
under the midpoint of the clavicle.15 Before testing, measurement
points on the biceps, triceps, and pectoralis major were marked,
and the same measurement points were used for each testing
session. The measurements were carried out while the subjects
stood with their elbows extended and relaxed. The subcutaneous
adipose tissue-muscle interface and the muscle-bone interface
were identified from the ultrasonographic image, and the distance
between the two interfaces was defined as muscle thickness.
Measurements were taken a week prior to the start of training, and
48-hour after the final training session.
2.5. Medicine ball throw test
The assessment of upper-body power output performance was
conducted using the kneeling medicine ball throw test using 2kg
and 4kg medicine ball. Subjects start in a kneeling position and the
thighs should be parallel and the knees at the start line, then in one
motion the ball is pushed forward and up. The knees are not to
leave the ground during throw. Two attempts are performed with
at least 45 seconds recovery between each throw, and the best
recorded attempt was used as the representative value. All testing
was completed under the supervision of NSCA-CSCS.
2.6. Statistical analysis
SPSS statistical software, version 22.0 for Macintosh, was used to
perform all statistical evaluations. A two-way mixed ANOVA
(groups � time) was performed to assess training-related differ-
ences in the bench-press and push-up groups for each dependent
variable. In addition, Bonferroni's post-hoc test was performed to
evaluate training-related changes within groups. Cohen's d effect
sizes were estimated for all observations to compare the magnitude
of training response, with �0.20 representing a small effect, 0.50
representing a medium effect, and �0.80 representing a large ef-
fect.16 The threshold for significance was set at p < 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. Muscle hypertrophy
Significant increases in muscle thickness (triceps and pectoralis
major) were observed in the bench-press group (triceps, from
26.3 ± 3.7 mm to 27.8 ± 3.8 mm, p < 0.01; PM, from 17.0 ± 2.8 mm
to 20.8 ± 4.8 mm, p < 0.01) and in the push-up group (triceps, from
27.7 ± 5.7 mm to 30.4 ± 6.6 mm, p < 0.01; pectoralis major, from
17.0 ± 2.8 mm to 20.8 ± 4.8 mm, p < 0.01). Significant increase in
biceps muscle thickness was observed only in the bench-press
group (from 28.4 ± 3.3 mm to 31.5 ± 3.7 mm, p < 0.01), with no
significant change in the push-up group (from 29.3 ± 5.0 mm to
30.3 ± 4.6, p ¼ 0.315). The change in muscle thickness at the three
sites is shown in Fig. 2. There was no significant difference between
the groups.
3.2. Muscle strength and performance
Significant increases in 1RM were observed in the bench-press
group (from 60.0 ± 12.1 kg to 65.0 ± 12.1 kg, p < 0.01) and in the
push-up group (from 61.1 ± 12.2 kg to 64.2 ± 12.5 kg, p < 0.01)
(Table 1). No significant change was observed in medicine ball
throwing or maximum repetition test. There was significant dif-
ference in % increase of muscle endurance capacity between groups
(P < 0.01), but not in power output performance (Fig. 3).
4. Discussion
This investigation is the first to compare muscle hypertrophy
between low-intensity bench-press and push-up training per-
formed with similar intensity, rest interval, and speed of move-
ment. We found that push-up training induced similar increases in
muscle thickness of the triceps and pectoralis major to the 40% 1RM
bench press. Similar strength gains were also observed in both
groups. In present study, three site of ultrasonography measure-
ment were performed as the indicator of muscle hypertrophy,
however, muscle thickness is not a direct measurement for indi-
cating muscle hypertrophy.15,17
The relationship between low-intensity bodyweight training
and muscle hypertrophy has not been previously reported. The
main finding of the present study was that low-intensity body-
weight training induced muscle hypertrophy, with increased in
muscle thickness of the pectoralis major (push-up: 18.3%, bench
press: 19.4%) and triceps (push-up: 9.5%, bench press: 10.3%). These
results are consistent with a previous study15 reporting that
resistance training at 40%1RM resulted in a 24% increase in muscle
thickness in untrained young men. In the present study, a 19.4%
increase in muscle thickness of pectoralis major was observed in
the bench-press group after an 8-week training session. The
percent change of muscle thickness in the bench-press group was
similar to that previously reported for 8-week training periods in
untrained young men.15 A recent study suggested that low-load
(30% 1RM) was as effective as high-load training (80% 1RM) for
increasing muscle protein synthesis and signaling such as mTOR,
p70S6K, and ERE1/2 in acute response of resistance exercise to
volitional failure, and that 10-week leg extension resistance
training protocols involving 3 sets of low-load (30% 1RM) or high-

39
 load (80% 1RM) intensity, but not 1 set of high-load intensity,
induced muscle hypertrophy.9 The present study extends this
observation by showing that low-load resistance training to failure
involving either bench press or push-up is also effective for muscle
hypertrophy.
Bench-press exercise is performed in a supine position on the
bench. By contrast, the push-up is performed in a prone position
and involves greater latissimus dorsi muscle activation.18 However,
Calatayud et al.12 reported comparable levels of muscle activation
during push-up and bench press and comparable muscle strength
gains after 8 weeks of training with either exercise. Our results
further suggest that push-up training induces similar muscle hy-
pertrophy to bench-press training in the pectoralis major and
triceps.
A previous study indicated that push-up training on a stable or
unstable surface does not provide significant improvement in
muscle strength or endurance in 8 weeks.2 Since each group per-
formed three sets of 10 repetitions, the authors speculated that low
training volume is a possible explanation for the lack of a statisti-
cally significant difference. On other hand, in the study by Cala-
tayud et al.12 investigated push-up with elastic-band resistance to
achieve the same muscle activation as 6RM bench press and found
that 5 weeks of push-up exercise with similar EMG activity to
bench press was effective for muscle strength gain (percent change
of 1RM: 13%). In our study, push-ups and bench press performed at
a similar intensity of 40%1RM induced comparable strength gain.
Since subjects in our study performed exercises to failure, sufficient
training volume was achieved. In our study, the percent changes of
1RM in push-up and bench press were 5% and 8%, respectively.
Although the strength increase was lower than that reported by
Calatayud et al.,12 push-up training without any resistive staffs is
effective for strength gain.
Although we observed a significant 8% increase in biceps muscle
thickness in the bench-press group, biceps muscle hypertrophy has
not been previously reported in bench-press training.15 Since
certified training experts supervised their training, they performed
the bench press exercise with a standard technique. It is a very low
possibility, but they might perform the bench press with a wide or
narrow grip. It induced greater biceps muscle activation compared
to the middle grip,19 which may have led to biceps hypertrophy, but
not in push up group in our study.
We did not observe an improvement in performance parame-
ters such as endurance and power output performance. In
endurance performance, we measured maximal repetition test for
bench press using relative intensity such as 40% 1RM based on
recent 1RM test in present study. Nevertheless, 1RM strength
following low intensity strength training increase in both groups
and intensity was higher in post-test than pre-test. However,
bench press group has higher % change in muscle endurance than
push up group, because of specific adaptation to imposed de-
mands. Improvement in power output parameters requires high
intensity, high-velocity resistance training, and/or plyometric
training.20,21 By contrast, we investigated low-intensity exercise
with controlled movement and speed. Several authors examining
the activation patterns of active muscles during variants of the
push-up have reported altered electromyography levels. In addi-
tion, it may be necessary to consider not only the load of the
exercise but also movement speed, such as by using plyometric
push-ups, for improvements in physical performance.
The following limitations may have effects on interpreting the
results of the present study. First, we could not controlled dietary
intakes and physical activity level in present study. Second, we
could not measured latissimus dorsi thickness as well and might
be there any differences here between groups. Third, the lack of an
electromyography analysis and assessment of subjects of recrea-
tional noncompetitive exercisers prevent a comparison of our re-
sults with previous studies such as that of Calatayud et al.,12 who
reported that in trained subjects, 6RM bench press and push-up
comparable gains in muscle strength, but no difference in mus-
cle function or performance between low-intensity and high-
intensity resistance training. Future studies are necessary to
ascertain the effects of push-up and bench press with similar in-
tensity on muscle hypertrophy and strength gains in highly
trained subjects.
In conclusion, push-up and bench-press exercise at 40%1RM
over 8 weeks are similarly effective for increasing muscle thick-
ness and strength gain. The intensity of push-up can be altered
with the use of push-up variations, such as with knees bent or
changing hand or foot elevation, the exercise can be performed at
40�75% of body weight,5,6 and it can be performed at higher loads
by using an elastic band or weight plate on the back.11 These data

 and our present results can be used to quantify the approximate
load as a percentage of body mass for the purpose of quantifying
load and volume in a resistance training program to enhance
upper body fitness.
