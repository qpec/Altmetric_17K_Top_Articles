In Brief
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an aerosol
pathogen that can disseminate from the
airways. Nair et al. report that airway M
cells actively translocate M. tuberculosis
to initiate infection. Depletion of M cells
prevents M. tuberculosis dissemination
from the mucosa and delays mortality in
mice.

SUMMARY
The prevailing paradigm is that tuberculosis infection
is initiated when patrolling alveolar macrophages and
dendritic cells within the terminal alveolus ingest
inhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However,
definitive data for this model are lacking. Among the
epithelial cells of the upper airway, a specialized
epithelial cell known as a microfold cell (M cell)
overlies various components of mucosa-associated
lymphatic tissue. Here, using multiple mouse models,
we show that Mtb invades via M cells to initiate infec-
tion. Intranasal Mtb infection in mice lacking M cells
either genetically or by antibody depletion resulted
in reduced invasion and dissemination to draining
lymph nodes. M cell-depleted mice infected via aero-
sol also had delayed dissemination to lymph nodes
and reduced mortality. Translocation of Mtb across
two M cell transwell models was rapid and transcellu-
lar. Thus, M cell translocation is a vital entry mecha-
nism that contributes to the pathogenesis of Mtb.
INTRODUCTION
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes 8 million cases
of tuberculosis and 1.3 million deaths worldwide annually.
Although person-to-person Mtb transmission requires an obli-
gate airborne route, when inhaled, the precise mechanism
used by Mtb to penetrate the mucosal barrier remains unknown.
Importantly, about 10% of all cases of active tuberculosis involve
isolated infection of cervical lymph nodes (LNs), suggesting that
pulmonary infection per se may not be required for infection. This
form of tuberculosis, also called scrofula, commonly manifests in
children (Fontanilla et al., 2011).
When airborne particles are inhaled, medium and large parti-
cles are trapped in the nasopharyngeal and tracheobronchial re-
gion, whereas smaller particles can reach the distal lung (Roy
and Milton, 2004). Mtb particles range in size from 0.65 (small)
to >7.0 mm (medium-large) (Fennelly et al., 2004). Thus, some
Mtb-containing particles are likely trapped in the proximal
airway, whereas other particles distribute distally. Although the
current paradigm is that tuberculosis is initiated by primary infec-
tion of alveolar macrophages (AMs), alternative routes of entry,
such as via epithelial cells or via mucosa-associated lymphatic
tissue (MALT), have been proposed (Behr and Waters, 2014;
Bermudez and Goodman, 1996).
Oropharyngeal and airway MALT is prevalent in childhood,
including nasal-associated lymphatic tissue (NALT), the tonsils
and adenoids of Waldeyer’s ring, and bronchus-associated
lymphatic tissue (BALT), but tends to regress in adulthood (De-
bertin et al., 2006). Whether BALT is present in adults is contro-
versial (Randall, 2010); however, BALT-like structures, also
known as induced BALT (iBALT) (Foo and Phipps, 2010), can
be induced by bacterial and viral infections (Halle et al., 2009).
Overlying MALT is a rare, specialized cell called a microfold or
M cell, whose primary function is to deliver mucosal particles
to submucosal antigen-presenting cells (Mabbott et al., 2013).
M cells are found primarily in the gastrointestinal tract overlying
Peyer’s patches. M cells can also be found in the upper airway
overlying NALT, adenoids, and BALT. Although significantly
less is known about airway than gastrointestinal M cells (Kanaya
and Ohno, 2014), a recent study demonstrated shared expres-
sion of vital differentiation molecules in mouse NALT M cells
(Mutoh et al., 2015).
Airway M cells can mediate infection by bacteria such as
Streptococcus pyogenes (Park et al., 2003) and Bacillus an-
thracis (Plaut et al., 2012). Infection of cattle with Mycobacte-
rium bovis can be achieved by direct inoculation of bovine
tonsils (Palmer et al., 2007), and drinking unpasteurized milk
contaminated with M. bovis can cause human tuberculosis
that frequently manifests as cervical lymphadenitis (Cosivi
et al., 1998). At the cellular level, Mtb (Kumagai, 1922), Myco-
bacterium bovis var. bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Fujimura,
1986), and M. avium (Secott et al., 2004) can translocate
across Peyer’s patches, and it was reported over 15 years
ago that, in experimentally infected mice, Mtb is occasionally
found inside cells with the morphologic appearance of M cells
(Teitelbaum et al., 1999). However, a functional analysis of
M cell-mediated translocation of Mtb has not been performed.
Here we show that airway M cells can directly mediate
primary infection by Mtb and facilitate dissemination beyond
the mucosa.

 RESULTS
Genetic Depletion of M Cells Reduces Mycobacterial
Dissemination to Cervical Lymph Nodes
To determine whether murine NALT inoculation is sufficient to
initiate infection with Mtb, we established an intranasal infection
model and found that doses of 106 colony-forming units (CFUs)
or greater could lead to consistent dissemination to the draining
cervical lymph nodes (cLNs) 30 days after infection (Figure S1).
Using a small volume (10 ml) isolated the initial inoculum to the
NALT (Figure S1). The earliest time after infection that we could
detect Mtb in the cLNs was 7 days. Between day 0 (inoculum)
and day 7, Mtb was rarely recovered from the lungs, and on
day 7, dissemination occurred prior to the onset of cell-mediated
immunity. Thus, Mtb can disseminate from the NALT to initiate
infection.
Development of mouse NALT M cells was recently associated
with expression of the transcription factor Spi-B and receptor
activator of nuclear factor k-B ligand (RANKL) signaling (Mutoh
et al., 2015). Because mice deficient in the transcription factor
Spi-B lack Peyer’s patch M cells (Kanaya et al., 2012), we exam-

(C and D) M cells were quantified in the NALT of

ined the NALT of Spi-B�/� mice (Su et al.,
1997) to determine whether they also lack
NALT M cells. Although several cell sur-
face markers have been used to identify
Peyer’s patch M cells, those for NALT M
cells are less well characterized. There-
fore, we tested several established M
cell markers and found that the antibodies NKM 16-2-4 (Nochi
et al., 2007), anti-Sialyl LewisA (SLA) (Giannasca et al., 1999)
identified two populations of M cells on diffuse or organized
NALT, respectively (Figure S1). By immunohistochemistry,
NALT NKM 16-2-4 staining was similar to that in a previous
report (Nochi et al., 2007), and anti-SLA staining identified cell
surface staining of dome-shaped cells characteristic of M cells
(Figure S1). By immunofluorescence microscopy (Figures 1A
and 1B), Spi-B�/� mice had a significant reduction in M cells (Fig-
ures 1C and 1D), with a 75% reduction in cells detected by NKM
16-2-4 overlying the diffuse NALT and an 80% reduction in SLA-
positive cells overlying the organized NALT. Because Spi-B-defi-
cient mice have pleiotropic immune defects (Garrett-Sinha et al.,
1999), we limited our Mtb NALT infection to 7 days post-infec-
tion. Although the initial inocula in the NALT were the same for
Spi-B�/� mice and wild-type littermates (Figure 1E), by day 7,
Spi-B�/� mice had significantly fewer bacteria in cLNs (Fig-
ure 1F). No bacteria were isolated from the lungs of either
wild-type or Spi-B�/� mice. Thus, we conclude that genetic inhi-
bition of M cell differentiation decreased Mtb translocation and
dissemination to draining cervical lymph nodes.

 Antibody-Mediated Depletion of M Cells in Wild-Type
Mice Reduces Mycobacterial Dissemination to Cervical
Lymph Nodes
To determine whether depletion of M cells in wild-type mice af-
fects Mtb infection via NALT, we took advantage of the rat
anti-mouse RANKL monoclonal antibody IK22-5, which can
deplete M cells in the gastrointestinal tract (Knoop et al., 2009).
We injected BALB/c mice intraperitoneally with the IK22-5
monoclonal antibody (mAb) or an isotype-matched nonspecific
rat immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) mAb control (control Ig) every
2 days for 8 days (Knoop et al., 2009) and collected NALT
24 hr after the last treatment or infected the mice with Mtb.
IK22-5 treatment resulted in the expected loss of Peyer’s patch
M cells (data not shown). NALT M cells were reduced by immu-
nofluorescence to �50% of the wild-type using the NKM16-2-4
and anti-SLA antibodies (Figures 1G–1J), which was not as
robust as the �90% reduction in gastrointestinal M cells re-
ported previously (Knoop et al., 2009). A similar, �60% reduction
of NALT M cells was observed by immunofluorescence micro-
scopy using an antibody against another M cell marker, glyco-
protein 2 (GP2) (Mutoh et al., 2015; Figure S1). Following
intranasal infection of Mtb, equal numbers of bacteria were
enumerated from the NALT of M cell-depleted mice at time 0 (Fig-
ure 1K), but, at 7 days, these mice demonstrated an �50%
reduction in CFUs in the cLNs (Figure 1L). Thus, depletion of
NALT M cells by IK22-5 treatment reduced Mtb dissemination
to cLNs.
Dendritic cells have been proposed to transport Mtb to drain-
ing lymph nodes (Wolf et al., 2008), and thus an alternative expla-
nation for the reduced cLN dissemination might be that IK22-5
treatment depleted NALT dendritic cells (DCs). However, using
flow cytometry, we found that IK22-5 treatment did not affect
the absolute number of CD11c+ DCs in the NALT (Figure S2).
As an additional control for potential M cell-independent effects
of IK22-5 treatment, we infected IK22-5-treated mice intrave-
nously with 107 CFUs of Mtb via retro-orbital injection. The
dose was chosen to approximate the intranasal dose, and the
route was chosen for anatomic proximity to the NALT. Both initial
seeding of the lungs and NALT and CFUs 7 days after infection in
the lung, liver, spleen, and lymph node were equal between
groups (Figure S2).
M Cells Translocate Mycobacteria In Vitro
To test the ability of M cells to translocate Mtb in vitro, we used
an established model of M cell differentiation that relies on cocul-
turing human Caco-2 epithelial cells with RajiB cells on two sides
of a porous transwell (Figure S3; Kerne
´ is et al., 1997). Although
Caco-2 cells cultured alone form a homogenous, impermeable,
polarized monolayer (hereafter called ‘‘control’’), coculture with
RajiB cells induces some Caco-2 cells to differentiate into M cells
(hereafter called RajiB). We validated the model and found that
monolayers were impermeable to fluorescently labeled dextrans
as small as 2 kD, that Raji-B-treated cells translocated signifi-
cantly more inert beads than control cells, and that RajiB-cocul-
tured cells increased the number of cells lacking microvilli and
demonstrated a flatter and smoother surface consistent with M
cells (Figure S3).
We next measured the translocation of mycobacteria across
control and RajiB-cocultured cells. When M cell formation was
enhanced by the presence of RajiB cells, significantly more
Mycobacterium marinum (Figures 2A and 2B) and Mtb (Figures
2C and 2D) translocated across the transwell. Neither organ-
ism damaged the monolayer because transepithelial resis-
tance (TEER) was stable during translocation (Figures 2B and
2D). Mtb translocation did not occur by passive diffusion
through intercellular tight junctions or through small leaks in
the monolayer as translocation of Mtb was significantly dimin-
ished at 4�C (Figure 2E). To confirm the role of airway M cells in
Mtb translocation, we established a second M cell model of
translocation
using
the
human
bronchial
epithelial
cell
line 16HBE14o� (hereafter called HBE cells) (Cozens et al.,
1994). We grew HBE cells on 3.0-mm transwells with and

(A–D) M. marinum or Mtb (C and D) were added to the apical compartment
of Caco-2 transwells with or without coculture with RajiB cells. Percent
translocation was determined by dividing CFUs recovered from the baso-
lateral compartment by the apical compartment inoculum (A and C), and TEER
(B and D) was measured directly.
(E) Mtb was added to RajiB-treated transwells maintained at either 4�C or
37�C, and CFUs were enumerated as above.
(F) HBE cells were treated as above, and Mtb translocation was determined.

 without RajiB cell coculture and found that they behaved simi-
larly as Caco-2 cells with respect to adherence, TEER develop-
ment over time, bead translocation, Gram-positive and Gram-
negative bacterial translocation, and surface morphologic
changes in response to RajiB coculture (Figure S4). Impor-
tantly, as for Caco-2 cells, coculture with RajiB cells signifi-
cantly increased Mtb translocation (Figure 2F). Finally, we
studied Mtb translocation across control and RajiB-cocultured
Caco-2 cells by electron microscopy. Using scanning electron
microscopy, we observed only rare Mtb associated with the
surface microvilli on control Caco-2 transwells (Figure 3A). In
contrast, many more bacteria were observed on the surface
of RajiB cocultures, predominantly on the flattened, non-villous
M cells (Figure 3A). Occasionally we also observed groups of
bacteria overlying 5- to 10-mm defects in the cell surface, sug-
gesting a possible mode of entry via phagocytosis or pore for-
mation (Figure 3A, right). Using transmission electron micro-
scopy, we found Mtb entering and exiting cells, apparently
surrounded by a membrane (Figure 3B). Thus, we conclude
that Mtb translocated across M cells in vitro.
Antibody-Mediated Depletion of M Cells Prevents Mtb
Dissemination and Delays Mortality during Aerosol
Infection
M cells can be found not only in the NALT, where they are concen-
trated and easily identified, but also in the BALT. To determine
whether airway M cells can mediate Mtb dissemination via
BALT and whether they are important for mouse survival, we
conducted a low-dose aerosol infection (�200 CFUs of Mtb) of
IK22-5-treated mice and determined CFUs in the lungs and
mediastinal lymph nodes on day 0 and 18 days after infection.
The 18-day time point was chosen because it represents an early
time point for detection of Mtb in draining mediastinal lymph no-
des (Wolf et al., 2008). Despite having an equal number of bacte-
ria in the lungs on day 0 (data not shown), on day 18 there was a
trend toward reduced Mtb CFUs in the lungs and liver, although
this was not statistically significant (Figure 4A; data not shown).
In contrast, we found an approximately 1-log reduction of Mtb
dissemination to mediastinal LNs (mLNs) (Figure 4B). We also
observed a bimodal distribution in the mLNs of IK22-5-treated
mice, with about half of the mice showing a 2- to 3-log10 reduc-
tion in CFUs, suggesting the possibility of a bottleneck effect. An
alternative explanation for the reduced LN dissemination is that
IK22-5 treatment prevented the development or recruitment of
Ly6C+/CD11b+ inflammatory monocytes (IMs) to the lung; IMs
have been reported to transport Mtb from the lungs to draining
lymph nodes (Samstein et al., 2013). In uninfected mice, less
than 0.1% of the cells in the NALT were Ly6C+/CD11b+ (data
not shown). Pulmonary IM recruitment during aerosol Mtb
infection was unaffected by IK22-5 treatment (Figure S2). Thus,
IK22-5-mediated depletion of M cells prevented Mtb dissemi-
nation beyond the oropharynx and airways to draining lymph
nodes.
In conjunction with the CFU studies, we infected IK22-5-
treated mice via aerosol and monitored the mice for survival.
Surprisingly, survival from Mtb infection was significantly
improved (Figure 4C), suggesting that translocation via M cells
and dissemination beyond the lungs has a profound effect on
Mtb pathogenesis.
DISCUSSION
Our findings reveal that M cells are a portal of entry for Mtb.
Using two different mouse models of M cell loss, namely Spi-B
deficiency and IK22-5-mediated depletion, as well as two
different infection models, we show that a reduction in M cells
is associated with reduced lymph node dissemination and, in
the low-dose aerosol model, is also associated with improved
survival. M cell-mediated entry may not only be relevant for
Mtb but also for other respiratory pathogens that can dissemi-
nate from the respiratory tree to cause systemic disease, such
as S. aureus and B. anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax.
It was demonstrated previously that cells with the morphology
of respiratory M cells harbor Mtb during experimental infection
(Teitelbaum et al., 1999). In that study, Mtb translocation to para-
tracheal lymph nodes was rapid (i.e., occurring within 24 hr) and

 dependent on the presence of macrophages. Macrophage-defi-
cient Csfmop/Csfmop mice were more susceptible to Mtb disease
despite reduced lymph node involvement but equal lung CFUs;
they succumbed to experimental aerosol infection with 103
CFUs significantly earlier than wild-type control mice (Teitelbaum
et al., 1999). In contrast to infected Csfmop/Csfmop mice, M cell-
depleted mice had significantly delayed mortality compared with
wild-type mice, suggesting that reducing dissemination via M
cells in the context of a maintained, cell-mediated immune
response is protective during murine tuberculosis.
Despite reducing the number of airway M cells, some Mtb was
still able to translocate to draining lymph nodes. One potential
explanation is that, in our hands, loss of Spi-B or treatment
with IK22-5 reduced but did not eliminate M cells, and thus resid-
ual M cells in Spi-B�/� mice or IK22-5-treated mice could be
mediating Mtb entry. In that case, it is possible that complete
M cell loss, either via genetic or antibody-mediated depletion,
could more significantly protect mice from disease. Alternatively,
there may be fewer residual M cells in Spi-B�/� mice or IK22-5-
treated mice than we quantified using NKM 16-2-4, anti-SLA,
and anti-GP2 antibodies, suggesting an additional M cell-inde-
pendent mucosal entry route, such as via epithelial cells (Bermu-
dez and Goodman, 1996).
Although the so-called ‘‘pulmonary model’’ of tuberculosis is
attractive (Orme, 2014), there is evidence to suggest that initial
tuberculosis infection manifests as a lymphatic disease (Behr
and Waters, 2014). Interestingly, it was recently shown that
lymphatic endothelial cells could be directly infected by Mtb
(Lerner et al., 2016), although how extracellular bacteria reach
the endothelium is not known. Thus, applying our data to the
lymphatic model, we propose that medium and large bacteria-
containing droplets can initially attach to the nasopharyngeal
andbronchialepithelium,contactand translocateacrossadjacent
M cells, and then travel to draining lymph nodes, possibly via
dendritic cells or inflammatory monocytes. These findings have
implications not only for understanding the general pathogenesis
of pulmonary tuberculosis but also for tuberculosis cases like
scrofula that occur in the absence of obvious pulmonary involve-
ment. Tuberculosis remains a major global pandemic, and there is
an urgent need to understand how Mtb spreads from person to
person. A therapeutic approach aimed at preventing early Mtb
contact with M cells could represent a novel vaccination strategy
in humans to reduce Mtb infection, dissemination, and mortality.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Strains and Media
Mtb Erdman and M. marinum were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium or
on Middlebrook 7H11 plates supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-
dextrose-catalase. Tween 80 was added to liquid medium to a final concentra-
tion of 0.05%. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
were clinical isolates obtained from the microbiology laboratory and grown
in brain-heart infusion broth or Luria Bertani (LB) media, respectively.
Mice
Spi-B�/� mice (Su et al., 1997) on a C57BL/6J background were obtained
from the Sinha lab (State University of New York) and housed under specific
pathogen-free conditions. Mice were bred as heterozygotes, and age
and sex-matched littermates were used for experiments. BALB/c mice (6-
8-week-old females) were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory. Animal ex-
periments were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. For in vitro studies,
one-tailed ANOVA tests were used for experiments with multiple comparisons
using Dunnett’s test. For experiments with single comparisons, two-tailed
unpaired Student’s t test was used. For in vivo CFU measurements, the
non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used. Kaplan-Meier analysis was
used to analyze survival studies.
