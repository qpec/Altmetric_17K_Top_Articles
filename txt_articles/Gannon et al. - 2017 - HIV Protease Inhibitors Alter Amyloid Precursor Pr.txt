Mounting evidence implicates antiretroviral (ARV) drugs as potential contributors to the persistence
and evolution of clinical and pathological presentation of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders in
the post-ARV era. Based on their ability to induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in various cell
types, we hypothesized that ARV-mediated ER stress in the central nervous system resulted in chronic
dysregulation of the unfolded protein response and altered amyloid precursor protein (APP) pro-
cessing. We used in vitro and in vivo models to show that HIV protease inhibitor (PI) class ARVs
induced neuronal damage and ER stress, leading to PKR-like ER kinaseedependent phosphorylation
of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2a and enhanced translation of b-site APP cleaving
enzyme-1 (BACE1). In addition, PIs induced b-amyloid production, indicative of increased BACE1-
mediated APP processing, in rodent neuroglial cultures and human APP-expressing Chinese ham-
ster ovary cells. Inhibition of BACE1 activity protected against neuronal damage. Finally, ARVs
administered to mice and SIV-infected macaques resulted in neuronal damage and BACE1 up-
regulation in the central nervous system. These findings implicate a subset of PIs as potential
mediators of neurodegeneration in HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. (Am J Pathol

The prevalence of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders
(HAND), a spectrum of HIV-related central nervous system
(CNS) dysfunctions ranging from mild cognitive deficits to
HIV-associated dementia, remains high despite the success
of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in controlling HIV.1e4

 suggested to contribute to these changes in HAND neuro-
pathology, other risk factors, such as peripheral toxicities of
ARVs and potential central effects linked to enhanced
amyloidogenesis and aging, remain largely underexplored.
Among the six classes of ARVs currently prescribed,
nucleoside reserve transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and
HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have the longest history of
use and continue to be prescribed globally. NRTIs inhibit
the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme,12 and PIs prevent
gag-pol precursor polyprotein cleavage to block viral
maturation.13 As a result of combination ARV therapy that
incorporates several drugs from different categories with
PIs, HIV-infected individuals have experienced a 50%
reduction in mortality rates with reduced HIV-associated
dementia incidence.13 Despite their numerous benefits,
ARVs were also linked to wide-ranging, peripheral meta-
bolic and neural disturbances that could themselves influ-
ence
HAND
progression,
including
NRTI-associated
mitochondrial dysfunction manifesting as peripheral neu-
ropathy and myopathy14,15 and PI-associated dyslipidemia,
hypercholesterolemia, and metabolic syndrome.16e22
We previously demonstrated that ARV administration
lead to synaptodendritic damage in healthy adult rats and
SIV-infected macaques.23 We and others also showed ARV-
mediated accumulation of reactive oxygen species and
eventual synaptic damage and neuronal death in cortical
neurons.23,24 These data support a growing body of evi-
dence for significant ARV-associated CNS neurotoxic
effects, as was shown in the peripheral nervous system, and
suggest that ARVs may affect long-term neurocognitive
outcomes in patients. More importantly, both NRTIs and PIs
were shown to induce numerous cellular stress response
pathways,
including
endoplasmic
reticulum
(ER)
and
oxidative stress, both of which were demonstrated in HAND
and other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer
disease (AD).25,26 Diverse cellular stressors converge on a
ubiquitous intracellular response mechanism termed the
unfolded
protein
response
(UPR;
alias
ER
stress
response).27,28 In eukaryotes, misfolded protein accumula-
tion and/or other stressors disrupt the interaction between
the ER-resident chaperone, binding protein (BiP), and the
luminal domain of one or more of the three ER membrane-
bound UPR sensors, PKR-like ER kinase (PERK), acti-
vating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and inositol-requiring
enzyme 1a, in the ER, permitting their consequent activa-
tion29; however, UPR activation is promiscuous as it can be
activated in response to a wide range of stimuli. Down-
stream effects of UPR induction include global protein
synthesis attenuation via eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 2a (eIF2a) phosphorylation, up-regulation of genes
containing the ER stress response element, and ER-
mediated protein degradation.30
Although transient UPR activation serves a protective
function, the chronic nature of cellular stress and stress
response activation in the CNS during HIV infection may
ultimately overwhelm ER’s buffering capacity, resulting in
aberrant UPR activation and eventual cell death.26,31 We and
others demonstrated a potential role for ER stress and UPR
activation in HAND pathogenesis, as well as in other neuro-
degenerative diseases.22,26,32,33 In postmortem brain tissue
from ARV-treated, HIVþ patients and AD patients, expres-
sion levels of BiP, phosphorylated eIF2a (p-eIF2a), ATF6b,
and other UPR markers were increased, primarily in neu-
rons.26,30,34 Interestingly, Vassar and colleagues35,36 showed
that in vivo UPR activation via glucose deprivation or tuni-
camycin in the CNS resulted in increased APP and b-amyloid
(Ab) deposition35e37 and that impaired brain energy
metabolism lead to chronic PERK activation, sustained
eIF2a phosphorylation, and b-site APP cleaving enzyme 1
(BACE1) up-regulation.36 Phosphorylation of eIF2a inhibits
global protein translation while up-regulating the translation
of a subset of mRNA species that contain multiple upstream
open reading frames in their 50
untranslated regions
(50 UTRs), including BACE1.36 BACE1, an aspartyl protease
critical for the generation of Ab from APP, was up-regulated
in the CNS of AD patients.38,39 Increased BACE1 expression
and activity were correlated with plaque number and cogni-
tion status, and BACE1 was implicated as a biomarker for
mild cognitive impairment and AD.39 Altogether, these
studies suggest that UPR-mediated up-regulation of BACE1
may function as an early event in AD pathogenesis.
In the present study, we determined the mechanisms by
which ARVs induced damage and death in primary neuro-
glial cultures and in vivo models. We also assessed whether
altered BACE1 expression and function were contributors.
We showed that two PIs, ritonavir and saquinavir, which
were previously shown to induce oxidative stress and syn-
aptic loss,23,24 induced neuronal damage and ER stress in
neuroglial cultures, leading to UPR activation and PERK-
dependent translational BACE1 up-regulation. In addition,
we found that PIs enhanced the production of Ab peptides in
neurons and human APP-expressing Chinese hamster ovary
(CHO) cells. Moreover, these findings were corroborated
with increased expression of BACE1 in macaques and
rodents that received chronic ARV treatment in vivo. These
studies suggested that PIs might alter APP processing and
contribute to the changing neuropathology and persistence of
cognitive decline among ARV-treated, HIVþ individuals.

Ethics Statement
All pigtailed macaques (Macaca nemestrina) were housed
and cared for in an indoor ABSL2 facility at the fully
Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Labora-
tory Animal Care Internationaleaccredited Johns Hopkins
University Research Animal Resources facility in accor-
dance with standards of the Animal Welfare Regulations,
the eighth edition of the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals,40 and the Weatherall Report. All
animal studies were approved by the Johns Hopkins
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(approval number PR12M310). Animal welfare was opti-
mized through social housing and provision of both edible
and manipulanda environmental enrichment by a dedicated
behaviorist. Water was supplied ad libitum, and animals
were provided commercial monkey chow twice daily and
fresh produce at least three times per week. Animals were
monitored daily by animal care and veterinary staff and
sedated with ketamine anesthesia for all sampling by
skilled veterinary personnel. Euthanasia was performed
under deep pentobarbital anesthesia by skilled veterinary
personnel, and tissues were perfused to decrease contam-
ination by blood and peripheral virus. The negative control
animals were mock-inoculated, and samples were obtained
at the same time points as for the inoculated, untreated
macaques.
SIV/Pigtail Macaque Model of Lentiviral CNS Disease
Pigtailed macaques (M. nemestrina) were inoculated with
SIV/DeltaB670 and SIV/17E-Fr, as described previously.41
Twelve days after infection, animals were divided into
placebo and ARV-treated groups until necropsy (range, day
161 to 175). ARV treatment was composed of the NRTI
tenofovir (Gilead, Oceanside, CA) at 30 mg/kg s.c. given
once daily, saquinavir (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and
atazanavir (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York, NY) at 205
and 270 mg/kg, respectively, given twice daily via oral
administration,
and
an
integrase
inhibitor,
L-870812
(Merck, Kenilworth, NJ),42 at 10 mg/kg orally twice daily.43
Tenofovir dosing was based on previous studies,44 whereas
saquinavir and atazanavir dosing was based on pharmaco-
kinetic analysis performed in pigtail macaques to reflect the
area under the curve parameters similar to those detected in
humans treated with atazanavir and saquinavir.43 L-870812
dosing was based on previous studies conducted in rhesus
macaques.42
Rodent Model of ARV-Induced Neurotoxicity
All surgical procedures were performed with the approval of
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia; approval number
803156). Adult male C57BL/6 mice were catheterized via the
jugular vein, as described previously.45 Before surgery, mice
were anesthetized with 80 mg/kg ketamine and 12 mg/kg
xylazine. An indwelling silastic catheter was placed into the
right jugular vein, sutured in place, and connected to a
backmount platform (Strategic Applications, Inc., Lake
Villa, IL) that was s.c. secured on the back of the animals with
sutures. Catheters were flushed daily with 0.1 mL of the
antibiotic clavulanic acid and ticarcillin (Timentin; bio-
WORLD, Dublin, OH) dissolved in heparinized saline (0.93
mg/mL). Treatment regimens were as follows: vehicle
[dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)], ritonavir (20 mg/kg), or sa-
quinavir (25 mg/kg), administered twice daily for 14 days by
continuous i.v. injection. These drug doses were based on
previously
published
pharmacokinetic
studies
in
rodents.46e48 At the time of euthanasia, catheter patency was
reverified by response to pre-euthanasia sedation (80 mg/kg
ketamine and 12 mg/kg xylazine). Euthanasia was performed
by carbon dioxide administration, followed by cervical
dislocation and decapitation to confirm death. Brains were
removed, frontal cortex and hippocampus were dissected on
ice, and tissue samples were stored at �80�C until immu-
noblot analyses were performed (vehicle, n Z 6; ritonavir,
n Z 7; saquinavir, n Z 7).

 Preparation of Primary Neuroglial Cultures
Primary rat or mouse cortical neuroglial cultures were
isolated from brains of embryonic day 16 Sprague-Dawley
rat pups or embryonic day 16.5 to 17.5 floxed PERK
(PERKloxP/loxP) mice, with modifications of previously
described protocols.49 Briefly, to generate neuroglial cul-
tures, cortical cell suspensions were isolated from rat or
mouse embryos and were plated on poly-L-lysineecoated
tissue culture dishes. Cultures were maintained in neuro-
basal media supplemented with B27 at 37�C with 5% CO2,
as described previously.50 Unless otherwise indicated, all
experiments were performed at 21 days in vitro (DIV) in
cultures containing approximately 90% neurons and 10%
astrocytes/glia at a density of 500,000 cells/mL. Pure
neuronal cultures were prepared by treating neuroglial cul-
tures with 10 mmol/L cytosine arabinoside 48 hours after
plating and were maintained in neurobasal media with B27
at 37�C with 5% CO2.
Human primary cortical neurons were obtained from the
Comprehensive NeuroAIDS Center, Temple University
(Philadelphia, PA). Cultures were prepared from fetal brain
tissue (gestational age, 16 to 18 weeks) performed in full
compliance with the NIH and Temple University ethical
guidelines, as described previously.51 A total of 50% of the
culture media was changed every 4 days, and cultures were
maintained at 37�C with 5% CO2 for 21 DIV.
Previously
characterized
PERKloxP/loxP
mice52
were
crossed with tamoxifen-inducible cre (Cre-ERT2) hetero-
zygous mice, and the resulting PERKloxP/loxP; Cre-ERT2
mice were kindly provided by Dr. Alan Diehl. PERK
deletion was achieved by treating 10 DIV mouse neuroglial
cultures
with
various
concentrations
of
4-
hydroxytamoxifen. Antiretroviral drug treatments were
performed 4 days after 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment to
allow for maximal PERK excision. Sixteen hours after an-
tiretroviral drug treatments, PERK�/� neuroglial cultures
were harvested for immunoblotting and genotyping using
routine methods.
Drug Treatments
Twenty-one DIV rat cortical neuroglial cultures or human
fetal neurons were treated with indicated log-fold con-
centrations of zidovudine (AZT; 25 mmol/L stock in
sterile water), or saquinavir or ritonavir (both drugs pre-
pared in DMSO at 25 mmol/L stock concentrations). The
final concentration of DMSO was 0.04% for all treat-
ments. All antiretroviral drugs were added to neuroglial
cultures 16 hours before harvest. Anisomycin and acti-
nomycin D were prepared in DMSO at 50 and 5 mmol/L
stock concentrations, respectively. Twenty-one DIV rat
cortical neuroglial cultures were pretreated with either 10
or 50 mmol/L anisomycin or 5 mmol/L actinomycin D for
12 hours, followed by treatment with 10 mmol/L ritonavir
for 16 hours.
Immunoblotting
Whole cell extracts of primary rat cortical cultures were
prepared with ice-cold whole cell lysis buffer containing
50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mmol/L NaCl, 0.5% NP-40,
and 0.4 mmol/L Na3VO4, supplemented with protease in-
hibitors. Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 � g at 4�C for
10 minutes. Protein concentrations were determined using
the Bradford method, and equal amounts of protein (15 to
20 mg) were loaded into each well of 4% to 12% Bis-Tris
gradient gels or 3% to 8% Tris-acetate gradient gels (for
confirmation of PERK overexpression). After transfer at
25 V at room temperature for 1 hour, polyvinylidene
difluoride membranes were blocked in tris-buffered saline
containing Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin for at
least 30 minutes at room temperature. Membranes were then
incubated in primary antibodies overnight at 4�C, washed
with tris-buffered saline and Tween 20, and incubated with
appropriate horseradish peroxidaseeconjugated secondary
antibodies for 30 minutes at room temperature. Membranes
were developed using SuperSignal West Dura extended
duration substrate, and densitometric analyses were per-
formed using NIH ImageJ software program version 1.44
(NIH, Bethesda, MD). Equal loading and transfer were
confirmed by fast green staining of membranes. Band den-
sities of interest were normalized to the indicated loading
controls or fast greenestained membranes. Immunoblots
shown are representative of at least three independent bio-
logical replicates.
RNA Isolation and Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from primary rat neuroglial cultures
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). To
assess the expression of spliced XBP-1 and BACE1 genes,
1 mg total RNA from each sample was processed by
SuperScript II First-Strand Synthesis system (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Approximately 100 ng cDNA was amplified
via quantitative RT-PCR using Custom TaqMan Gene
Expression Assays from Applied Biosystems (Foster City,
CA). Relative expression of mRNA levels from samples
was quantified using the comparative CT method, and data
were normalized to unspliced XBP-1 and TBP for spliced
XBP-1 and BACE1 genes, respectively. All samples were
run in triplicate, and experiments were repeated in at least
three biological replicates.
Human/Rat Ab ELISAs
Cell media from 21 DIV primary rat neuroglial cultures and
CHO cells stably expressing human wild-type APP were
diluted 25-fold and assessed with a human/rat Ab42- or Ab40-
specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA), according to
the manufacturer’s protocols. For experiments including
CHO cells, cultures were pretreated with 10 nmol/L,
Gannon et al
94
ajp.amjpathol.org - The American Journal of Pathology
 100 nmol/L, or 1 mmol/L BACE inhibitor IV (Calbiochem,
Billerica, MA) for 12 hours, followed by treatment with
10 mmol/L ritonavir or vehicle (DMSO) for 16 hours, at
which time media were collected. For rat neuroglial cultures,
cells were treated with combinations of antiretroviral drugs,
followed by media collection at 4 and 16 hours.
Human Soluble APP ELISAs
Cell culture media from CHO cells stably expressing human
wild-type APP were pretreated with 10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L,
or 1 mmol/L BACE inhibitor IV for 12 hours, followed by
treatment with 10 mmol/L ritonavir or DMSO vehicle for
16 hours, at which time media were collected. Conditioned
media were then diluted 25-fold, and human soluble APPa
(sAPPa) and sAPPb levels were measured with human
ELISA assays (IBL International, Toronto, ON, Canada),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.
20S Proteasome Activity Assay
Whole cell lysates prepared from 21 DIV rat cortical
neuroglial cultures treated with ritonavir, saquinavir, or
lactacystin for 16 hours, as described above, were used to
measure 20S proteasome activity (assay from Millipore),
according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. A total
of 10 mg protein per sample was used.
Immunofluorescence Staining of Neuroglial Cultures
To assess the neuroprotective effect of BACE1 inhibition,
neuroglial cultures grown on coverslips were pretreated with
1 mmol/L BACE inhibitor IV for 30 minutes, followed by
12 hours treatment with 10 mmol/L ritonavir. Propidium
iodide (15 mmol/L) was added to neuroglial cultures
15 minutes before the conclusion of treatments. Cultures
were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and fixed for 30 minutes with 4% paraformaldehyde/4%
sucrose in PBS, followed by permeabilization in 0.2%
bovine serum albumin plus 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for
1 hour at room temperature. Coverslips were then washed
twice with PBS and incubated with anti-MAP2 antibody
(1:1000) in normal antibody diluent overnight at 4�C. After
washing in PBSeTween 20, coverslips were incubated with
a fluorescein isothiocyanateeconjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG secondary antibody (1:200) for 30 minutes at room
temperature. Coverslips were mounted onto slides, and the
number of MAP2-positive cells was determined by blind
counting of all fields (15 at 200�; by P.J.G., N.S.K., and
G.V.D.W.) in three adjacent vertical columns through the
center of each coverslip.23 Images were captured using a
Nikon Eclipse E400 fluorescent microscope (Nikon Corp.,
Tokyo, Japan) equipped with an Olympus DP70 digital
camera (Olympus Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Propidium iodidee
positive puncta were hand-counted using NIH ImageJ
software program version 1.44 and were plotted as fold
changes compared to untreated controls. Averages were
expressed as means � SEM.
Pulse-Chase and Immunoprecipitation
Primary rat neuroglial cultures were grown in 60-mm dishes
for 21 DIV in neurobasal media supplemented with
B27. Cultures were pulse-labeled with 2 mL methionine/
cysteine-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium con-
taining 0.4 mCi 35S-labeled methionine and cysteine for
30 minutes. Cultures were washed twice with sterile Dul-
becco’s PBS and chased with neurobasal media plus B27
with or without 10 mmol/L ritonavir. At 0, 6, 12, 18, and
24 hours after labeling, cultures were harvested with ice-
cold lysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, and 0.4 mmol/L Na3VO4, supplemented
with protease inhibitors). Lysates were immunoprecipitated
with Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 2
mg anti-BACE1 (Cell Signaling Technology), run on a 4%
to 12% Bis-Tris gradient gel for separation, and transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for approxi-
mately 7 hours. Membranes were dried and exposed via
autoradiography.
Subcellular Fractionation
To evaluate ATF4 nuclear translocation in response to an-
tiretroviral drug treatments, 21 DIV rat neuroglial cultures
were treated with 10 mmol/L ritonavir or vehicle (DMSO)
for 16 hours, and cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were
prepared. Briefly, cultures were washed twice in ice-cold
PBS and lysed for 10 minutes in cytoplasmic lysis buffer
(10 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mmol/L KCL, 10 mmol/L
EDTA, 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, and 0.4% NP-40, supple-
mented with protease inhibitors). Extracts were centrifuged
at 4�C for 3 minutes at 15,000 � g, and cytoplasmic
supernatants were stored at �80�C. The remaining nuclear
pellets were resuspended in nuclear lysis buffer (20 mmol/L
HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 10%
glycerol, and 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, with protease in-
hibitors) and incubated at 4�C, with end-to-end rotation, for
2 hours. The nuclear supernatants were collected after
centrifugation at 15,000 � g for 5 minutes at 4�C. Protein
concentrations were determined using the Bradford method,
and lysates were run on 4% to 12% Bis-Tris gradient gels.
Membranes containing nuclear fractions were probed with
rabbit anti-ATF4 antibody.
Transfection Using Magnetic Nanoparticles
Pure neuronal cultures at DIV 10, prepared as described
above, were transfected with plasmid DNA via magneto-
fection using the Magnefect-Nano II system (Nanotherics).
Briefly, 0.5, 1, or 2 mg of the following plasmid DNAs were
complexed with 2.4 mL of Neuromag transfection reagent
(Nanotherics) for 15 to 20 minutes in serum-free neurobasal

taining 500,000 cells per well, and plates were incubated for
30 minutes at 37�C with 5% CO2 over a magnet array oscil-
lating at 3 Hz with 0.2-mm amplitude of displacement. At the
end of magnetofection, plates were removed from the magnet
array and were processed after 48 to 72 hours for either
immunoblotting or cell staining, following routine methods.
Statistical Analysis
All data were analyzed with Prism software version 5.0
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All quantifications
were expressed as means � SEM. Paired results were
analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test or unpaired t-test, and
data with multiple categories were analyzed by one-way
analysis of variance plus Newman-Keuls or Dunnett post
hoc test, as indicated. P < 0.05 was considered significant
for all statistical analyses performed.
Results
ARVs Induce Axonal Damage and UPR in Vivo
Several clinical studies have reported an inverse relation-
ship
between
ARV
regimens
that
have
high
CNS
penetration effectiveness scores and neurocognitive out-
comes.53e55 However, it has been difficult to separate CNS
toxicity induced by HIV from that of ARV. We previously
showed that ARVs administered to SIV-infected pigtail
macaques lead to decreases in markers of synaptodendritic
integrity, including synaptophysin, in the hippocampus
and calmodulin kinase II in the frontal cortex, compared to
SIV-infected, placebo-treated, or uninfected controls.23 In
this lentiviral-induced neurodegeneration model,41 adult
pigtail macaques started receiving either a placebo or an
ARV treatment (ART) that included tenofovir (NRTI),
atazanavir (PI), saquinavir (PI), and L-870812a (integrase
inhibitor) at 12 days after inoculation. Compared to 90% of
placebo-treated animals that develop neurological disease
within 12 weeks,41 those receiving ART did not develop
SIV encephalitis nor did they demonstrate neurological
dysfunction.43 Furthermore, they displayed a rapid reduc-
tion in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid viral loads and
suppression of viral replication with conservation of CD4þ
T-cell counts until elective euthanasia at day 160 after
inoculation. To expand on our previous findings, we used
immunofluorescence and immunoblotting to retrospec-
tively assess formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded hippo-
campal
tissue
from
this
cohort
to
determine
APP
expression. Accumulation of APP along axons was re-
ported in previous studies on various neuroinflammatory
diseases as well as trauma56e58; thus, we assessed APP
levels as a neuronal response to damage. Consistent with
our previous findings, we found that APP expression was
significantly elevated in the SIVþ/ART group than the
SIVþ/placebo and SIV� control groups (Figure 1, A and
B).
Interestingly,
placebo-treated
animals
showed
a
reduction in hippocampal APP levels compared to unin-
fected controls. These changes were corroborated by
immunoblotting of total APP (Figure 1, C and F). We also
observed increased BiP expression in SIVþ/placebo ani-
mals compared with SIV� controls, but no statistically
significant change in the SIVþ/ART group (Figure 1D).
More important, the SIVþ/ART macaques displayed a
significant increase in BACE1 compared to both SIVþ/
placebo and uninfected controls (Figure 1E), in agreement
with previous observations of accumulation of APP spe-
cies in the CNS of HIV-infected individuals.5,9,59,60 In
contrast, p-eIF2a levels were elevated only in the SIVþ/
placebo macaques and not in the ART-treated animals
(Figure 1G).
Samples
from
cohorts
of
ARV-treated
uninfected
humans and matching ARV-treated SIV� macaques are not
available. Therefore, to determine the contribution of
ARVs to neuronal UPR activation and BACE1 up-
regulation in vivo independent of virus, we administered
ritonavir or saquinavir i.v. to healthy adult mice for
2 weeks. Ritonavir and saquinavir doses were based on
published pharmacokinetic ARV studies in rodents.46,48,61
In agreement with our previous studies in rats, animals
displayed no overt signs of behavioral alterations or
distress
during
the
course
of
treatment.23
However,
immunoblotting analysis revealed a statistically significant
increase in BACE1 expression in the hippocampus in ri-
tonavir- and saquinavir-treated mice compared with the
vehicle-treated controls, complementing our findings in
SIVþ/ART macaques (Figure 2, A and B). ARV-treated
mice also displayed significant increases in
p-eIF2a
expression, whereas saquinavir-treated mice had elevated
levels of BiP in the hippocampus compared to ritonavir-
and vehicle-treated animals. These data further support a
role for ARV-associated UPR activation and BACE1 up-
regulation in the CNS.
ARVs Activate the UPR and Up-Regulate BACE1
Expression
We and others have shown that ARVs are toxic to primary
neurons.23,24,62 Although it is suggested that such toxicity is
mediated by mitochondrial DNA damage and/or pro-
oxidant properties of these drugs, additional mechanisms
may also contribute to ARV-mediated neuronal damage and
death. Given the established role of PIs inducing ER stress
in numerous cell types, including macrophages and hepa-
tocytes,17 we hypothesized that ARV drugs may be acti-
vating the UPR in neurons. Therefore, we examined
canonical UPR markers in primary rat neuroglial cultures in

 response to increasing concentrations of AZT, saquinavir, or
ritonavir (Figure 3A). Drug dose ranges used in our in vitro
studies were based on reported plasma and cerebrospinal
fluid levels of ARVs.63,64 At 16 hours after treatment with
ritonavir or saquinavir, neuroglial cultures displayed a
fivefold increase in BiP expression and more than a fourfold
increase in p-eIF2a (Figure 3, B and C). AZT treatment
(25 mmol/L) resulted in a threefold increase in BiP expres-
sion but did not significantly alter p-eIF2a. As an added
parameter to ensure the presence of ARV-mediated UPR
activation, we treated primary neuroglial cultures with
10 mmol/L ritonavir, 1 mmol/L saquinavir, 25 mmol/L AZT,
or 1 mmol/L thapsigargin (positive control) for 16 hours and
assessed the levels of spliced X box binding protein (XBP)-
1 relative to unspliced XBP-1 by TaqMan quantitative
RT-PCR (Figure 3G). We observed nearly a twofold in-
crease in spliced XBP-1 mRNA in ritonavir- and saquinavir-
treated cultures, but no change in AZT-treated neurons,
compared to vehicle controls.
Recent studies have shown that induction of ER stress in
neurons could increase protein expression of the APP-
cleaving enzyme, BACE1.36,65 Therefore, we sought to
determine whether ARV-treated neuroglial cultures, which
showed robust activation of ER stress, displayed changes in
BACE1 expression. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that
16-hour treatment with AZT, saquinavir, or ritonavir
resulted in fourfold to fivefold increases in BACE1
expression (Figure 3D). To rule out the possibility of
species-specific effects, we also treated 21 DIV human fetal
neurons with increasing doses of AZT, saquinavir, and
ritonavir for 16 hours and found similar, albeit statistically
insignificant, changes in both BACE1 and BiP expression in
saquinavir- and ritonavir-treated cultures (Figure 3, HeK).
In addition to BACE1, APP may be cleaved by two addi-
tional secretases, g-secretase and a-secretase, the latter of
which cleaves APP to preclude Ab production. To examine
whether ARVs affect the expression of a- and/or g-secretases,
we also immunoblotted for presenilin-1 C-terminal fragment
(g-secretase) and mature ADAM metalloproteinase domain
10 (a-secretase) (Figure 3A). We found no significant
changes in the expression of either of these enzymes regard-
less of drug treatment or dose (Figure 3, E and F). Taken
together, these data indicate that antiretroviral drugs, and PIs
in particular, induce UPR and BACE1 in neurons.

HIV PIs Up-Regulate BACE1
The American Journal of Pathology - ajp.amjpathol.org
97
 Ritonavir Increases BACE1 Processing of APP in
Primary Neurons
Based on our observation that ARVs induce BACE1
expression in neuroglial cultures, we sought to determine
whether this translated into functional changes in BACE1’s
enzymatic activity by assessing APP processing. To that
end, we treated CHO cells that are stably expressing human
APP with 10 mmol/L ritonavir, as a representative PI, for
16 hours and measured the relative amount of Ab species in
the culture media using a commercially available human/rat
Ab40- or Ab42-specific sandwich ELISA. Although ritonavir
had no effect on secreted Ab40 levels, Ab42 levels were
increased by nearly twofold (Figure 4A). In addition, pre-
treatment with a cell-permeable BACE1 inhibitor blocked
ritonavir-mediated increases in Ab42 in a dose-dependent
manner. These findings differ from previous reports that
changes in BACE1 activity affect the generation of all Ab
isoforms equally.66 To further understand how ritonavir
may be affecting human APP processing, CHO culture
media were measured for sAPPb and sAPPa by ELISA
(Figure 4, B and C). In contrast to the observed increases in
Ab42 peptide, no significant changes in sAPPb or sAPPa
were detected in culture media from ritonavir-treated CHO
cells. We also used the human/rat Ab40- or Ab42-specific
sandwich ELISA to assess Ab40 and Ab42 release into the
media of rat cortical neuroglial cultures treated with com-
binations of ARV drugs (Figure 4, D and E). At 4 hours after
treatment, no changes were observed in secreted Ab40 or
Ab42 peptides; however, at 16 hours after treatment, all ARV
combinations resulted in 1.5- and 3-fold increases in Ab40
and Ab42 levels, respectively. In conjunction with our in vivo
findings of increased Ab oligomers in HAND patients and
increased APP in SIV-infected/ART-treated macaques, these
findings suggest that ARVs promote BACE1 processing of
APP in CNS neurons.
BACE1 Inhibition Prevents MAP2 Loss in Ritonavir-
Treated Neuroglial Cultures
Several lines of evidence suggest that BACE1 may act as a
stress response protein in the CNS.36,67,68 Therefore, we
sought to determine whether BACE1 has a protective or
deleterious effect on neuronal survival after chronic exposure
to ritonavir. Primary rat cortical cultures were pretreated with
vehicle (DMSO) or 1 mmol/L BACE1 inhibitor for 30
minutes, followed by 10 mmol/L ritonavir for 48 hours.
Cultures were labeled with propidium iodide to assess
cellular viability and immunostained for MAP2 and synap-
sin. BACE1 inhibition had no effect on MAP2þ cell count,
synapsin intensity, or propidium iodide uptake compared
with untreated and vehicle controls (Figure 5A). Forty-eight
hour ritonavir treatment resulted in a threefold decrease in
MAP2þ cell count and nearly a threefold increase in propi-
dium iodide uptake, but no change in synaptic integrity
relative to MAP2 area in 10 DIV neuroglial cultures
(Figure 5, AeD). More important, pretreatment with BACE1
inhibitor rescued MAP2þ cell loss in ritonavir-treated

 neurons and decreased propidium iodide uptake (Figure 5D).
Together, these results suggest BACE1 may contribute to
PI-mediated neuronal damage and death.
Ritonavir Up-Regulates BACE1 Expression in a
Translation-Dependent Manner
Vassar and colleagues35,36 first reported that chronic acti-
vation of the UPR results in translational up-regulation of
BACE1. To determine whether ARVs increase BACE1
expression by altering mRNA levels, we first treated 21 DIV
rat neuroglial cultures with ritonavir, saquinavir, AZT, or
thapsigargin for 16 hours and harvested mRNA for quanti-
tative RT-PCR. We observed no changes in BACE1 mRNA
in any of the ARV-treated cultures compared to controls;
however, there was a significant decrease in BACE1 mRNA
in thapsigargin-treated neuroglial cultures (Figure 6A). To
confirm that BACE1 regulation is occurring via a post-
transcriptional
mechanism,
we
pretreated
neuroglial
cultures with a translation inhibitor, anisomycin, or a tran-
scription inhibitor, actinomycin D, for 12 hours, followed by
16 hours treatment with ritonavir, and harvested protein ly-
sates for analysis by immunoblotting for BACE1. Inhibition
of transcription with 5 mmol/L actinomycin D did not affect

HIV PIs Up-Regulate BACE1
The American Journal of Pathology - ajp.amjpathol.org
99
 up-regulation of BACE1 protein levels by ritonavir; how-
ever, translation inhibition by 10 or 50 mmol/L anisomycin
abrogated ritonavir-mediated BACE1 protein up-regulation
(Figure 6, B and C), indicating that PIs are exerting their
effects on neuronal BACE1 expression through either a
translational or a post-translational mechanism.
ATF4 is a canonical target of translational control by
p-eIF2a. Similar to BACE1, ATF4 mRNA contains multi-
ple upstream open reading frames in its 50 UTR, which act
to suppress translation under basal conditions, but undergo
scan-through after phosphorylation of eIF2a, leading to
selective translational up-regulation during conditions of ER
stress.36,65,69 ATF4 subsequently translocates to the nucleus
to up-regulate the expression of genes involved in the UPR.
Thus, we determined whether ATF4 was increased in the
nucleus
of
ritonavir-treated
neuroglial
cultures
after
16 hours of treatment. We observed nearly a fivefold
increase in nuclear ATF4 in ritonavir- and thapsigargin-
treated neuroglial cultures, whereas cytoplasmic levels
remained unchanged (Figure 6, D and E). Similarly, BACE1
expression was increased greater than twofold in the cyto-
plasm of ritonavir-treated cultures (Figure 6, D and E).
To confirm that translational control of BACE1 is
occurring through its 50 UTR, we transfected rat cortical
neuroglial cultures with vectors containing full-length
human BACE1 with the 50 UTR (þ50 UTR) or without
the 50 UTR (�50 UTR). We then treated cultures with
DMSO or ritonavir for 16 hours. Similar to our wild-type rat
cortical cultures, the neurons transfected with þ50 UTR/
BACE1 cDNA displayed nearly a threefold increase in
BACE1 expression after treatment with ritonavir compared
to vehicle controls (Figure 6F). Deletion of the 50 UTR
resulted in a significant increase in overall BACE1 expres-
sion in transfected cells, as described previously36,70; how-
ever, overexpression of the -50 UTR/BACE1 construct
prevented ritonavir-mediated up-regulation of BACE1 in
neurons (Figure 6, F and G). We also assessed whether a PI-
mediated increase in BACE1 occurred via proteasome in-
hibition, based on previous studies on dividing cells.19,71e73
As seen in Figure 6H, compared to cultures treated with the
proteasome inhibitor lactacystin, neither ritonavir nor sa-
quinavir led to proteasome inhibition in neuroglial cultures
after 16 hours, providing further evidence for the trans-
lational control of BACE1 in neurons exposed to these PIs.
Figure 4
ARV drugs increase BACE1 processing of APP in primary neurons. Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human APP were either treated
with 10 mmol/L ritonavir alone for 16 hours or pretreated with increasing doses of a cell-permeable BACE1 inhibitor (BSI) for 12 hours before ritonavir
treatment. Culture media were analyzed with a human/rat Ab42- or Ab40-specific sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; A) or a human sAPPa
or sAPPb ELISA (B and C). A: Ritonavir led to a twofold increase in Ab42 production that was dose-dependently blocked by BSI, whereas Ab40 levels were not
affected by ritonavir. No statistically significant changes in sAPPb (B) or sAPPa (C) were observed in ritonavir-treated cultures, although sAPPb was
dose-dependently decreased with BSI. D and E: Primary rat neuroglial cultures were treated with various ARV combinations [10 mmol/L ritonavir, 1 mmol/L
saquinavir, and 25 mmol/L zidovudine (AZT)] for 4 or 16 hours. Culture media were analyzed with a human/rat Ab42- or Ab40-specific sandwich ELISA, as in A.
At 16 hours, both Ab42 and Ab40 levels were increased in most treatment conditions. AZT appeared to blunt PI-mediated enhancement of APP processing in
combination treatment. All values represent means � SEM. n Z 6 (AeC); n Z 3 (DeF). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (one-way analysis of variance, Dunnett post

 To rule out the involvement of a post-translational
mechanism in BACE1 up-regulation by ritonavir, we
performed a pulse-chase experiment using 35S-metabolic
radiolabeling to determine the half-life of BACE1 in
ritonavir-treated neuroglial cultures compared to vehicle
controls.
After
confirming
immunoprecipitation
of
BACE1 from neurons (Figure 7A), we pulse-labeled 21
DIV neuroglial cultures for 30 minutes and then chased
with neurobasal media with or without 10 mmol/L rito-
navir for up to 24 hours (Figure 7B). Compared to
controls, we observed no apparent difference in BACE1
half-life in ritonavir-treated neuroglial cultures over the
course of 24 hours (Figure 7C). In both treatment con-
ditions, we observed that BACE1 half-life was approxi-
mately 12 hours, similar to what has been reported
previously.36,74 Collectively, these data strongly suggest
that ritonavir-mediated up-regulation of BACE1 in neu-
rons occurs through a 50 UTR-dependent translational
mechanism.
PERK Is Necessary for ARV-Mediated BACE1
Up-Regulation in Neurons
Several reports have proposed a role for p-eIF2a in post-
transcriptional regulation of BACE1 under conditions of
oxidative and ER stress.36,65,75e77 However, eIF2a can be
phosphorylated by one of four kinases (PERK, PKR,
heme-regulated
inhibitor
kinase,
and
general
control
nonderepressible 2), depending on the type of stress
impinging on cells. Given that PERK is the central
kinase responsible for eIF2a phosphorylation under con-
ditions of ER stress, we assessed whether PERK was
involved in the stress response signaling in neuroglial
cultures treated with ARVs. To that end, we generated
neuroglial cultures from brains of tamoxifen-inducible
cre recombinase conditional PERK knockout embryonic
mice. At DIV 10, neuroglial cultures were treated with
100 nmol/L or 1 mmol/L 4-hydroxytamoxifen to excise the
PERK gene.52 The estimated efficiency of PERK excision
in neurons was approximately 50% to 60% after 96 hours
of 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment (Figure 8A). Wild-type
and PERK-excised neurons were treated with 10 mmol/L
ritonavir or 1 mmol/L saquinavir for 16 hours. As shown
in
Figure
8,
B
and
C,
PERK-excised
neuroglial
cultures treated with ritonavir or saquinavir displayed
reduced p-eIF2a and BACE1 compared to wild-type
cultures treated with the same drugs. These findings indi-
cate that ARV-mediated BACE1 up-regulation in neuro-
glial cultures is dependent on UPR signaling through
PERK.

HIV PIs Up-Regulate BACE1
The American Journal of Pathology - ajp.amjpathol.org
101
 Discussion
The unanticipated persistence of neurocognitive deficits in
HIVþ patients is a growing public health concern as the
average age of patients in the United States is expected to be
>50 years by 2015.78 Mounting clinical and experimental
evidence suggests ARV-mediated neurotoxicity; however,
potential mechanisms remain elusive. Previously, we have
reported ARV-mediated reactive oxygen species production
in primary neurons, leading to activation of the endogenous
antioxidant response.23 Our findings in this study provide a
mechanistic link between ARV-mediated UPR in neurons
and increased BACE1 in the CNS of mice and SIV-infected,
ART-treated macaques.
We herein show, for the first time, that ARVs, PIs in
particular, activate the UPR in primary rat neuroglial cul-
tures as well as human fetal neurons. We also observed
increased nuclear ATF4, indicating functional changes in
the translational profile of neurons as a result. The specific
mechanism by which PIs and NRTIs activate the UPR in
neurons, albeit unclear, is likely multifactorial. In other cell
types, PIs induce UPR via proteasome inhibition and

Ritonavir up-regulates neuronal BACE1 expression via translation-dependent control. A: Rat neurons were exposed to indicated treatments for
16 hours. BACE1 mRNA was determined using the DDCt method relative to TATA-Box binding protein (TBP). Quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed in
triplicate (one-way analysis of variance, Dunnett post hoc). B: Rat neurons were either treated with ritonavir alone or pretreated with anisomycin or acti-
nomycin D for 12 hours before ritonavir. Fast green was used as a loading control. C: Compared to ritonavir-only treated neurons, anisomycin pretreatment
resulted in decreased BACE1 expression (one-way analysis of variance, Newman-Keuls post hoc). D: Rat neurons were treated for 16 hours, and cytoplasmic and
nuclear fractions were analyzed by immunoblotting. E: Densitometric analysis revealed a significant increase in activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and
BACE1 (one-way analysis of variance, Dunnett post hoc). F: Fourteen DIV rat cortical cultures were transfected with pcDNA3.1Zeoþ vector containing full
human BACE1 coding region, including the BACE1 50 UTR but missing the 30 UTR (þ50 UTR), or pcDNA3.1Zeoþ vector containing human BACE1 coding region,
including the 30 UTR but missing the 50 UTR (-50 UTR). Forty-eight hours later, cultures were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide or 10 mmol/L ritonavir for 16
hours, and immunoblotted for BACE1. Representative blots are shown. G: Quantification of BACE1 was normalized to actin (one-way analysis of variance,

 depletion of ER Caþ,2,17,71e73 and pharmacological inhibi-
tion of proteasome activity can activate PERK.79 Further
studies will be necessary to determine whether PIs inhibit
proteasome function in neurons, and if it precedes eIF2a
phosphorylation, and whether rescue of proteasome function
abrogates these changes as well as potential downstream
effects, including translational up-regulation of ATF4 and
BACE1.
Our findings confirm a report by Vassar and colleagues,36
who showed chronic activation of UPR in neurons linked to
50
UTR-dependent
translational
BACE1
up-regulation.
AZT, saquinavir, and ritonavir increased BACE1 expres-
sion in both rodent and human neurons after 16 hours, in
parallel to increased nuclear ATF4. This increase in BACE1
was at least partially mediated by PERK; however, potential
contribution of other eIF2a kinases could be ruled out.
Interestingly,
PERK
excision
decreased
p-eIF2a
and
BACE1 levels, albeit had no effect on BiP or APP, indi-
cating divergent mechanisms at play in ARV-treated neu-
rons. Although BiP is transcriptionally regulated during ER
stress, the mechanism of APP up-regulation remains unclear
and may be unrelated to UPR activation.
More important, neither presenilin-1 C-terminal fragment,
the g-secretase subunit, nor ADAM metalloproteinase
domain 10 showed any changes in expression after ARV
treatment. Notably, mature g-secretase is tightly regulated at
multiple levels; thus, further studies will be necessary to
conclusively determine whether ARVs alter the frequency
and/or efficiency of g-secretase cleavage via regulation
of other essential subunits or cellular modulators of g-
secretase, including the g-secretase activating protein.
However, our results strongly suggest ARV-mediated spe-
cific BACE1 up-regulation is because of its unique mRNA
structure. Unlike presenilin-1 and ADAM10, BACE1
mRNA contains three upstream open reading frames in its
long, GC-rich, 50 UTR that suppress translation under
normal cellular conditions36 and allow for more efficient
BACE1 mRNA translation because of scan-through p-eIF2a
to bypass inhibitory upstream open reading frames; this is
an evolutionarily conserved mechanism among many spe-
cies to control translation of stress-related genes.69 How-
ever, it remains unclear what protective, if any, role BACE1
might have in neurons undergoing UPR.
One potentially detrimental consequence of elevated
BACE1 expression is increased APP processing to generate
Ab
peptides.
Giunta et
al80 was the
first to show
ARV-mediated Ab production in Swedish mutant APP-
overexpressing
N2a
cells.
Our
findings
of
ritonavir-
mediated Ab42 increases in human APP-expressing CHO
cells did not extend to Ab40 production, despite the detected
ARV-mediated Ab40 increases in rat neuroglial culture
media. This divergence may result from potential differences
in APP processing in CHO cells versus neurons, as selective
Ab40 degradation was shown in these cells. Alternatively,
APP overexpression may precipitate ER stress and UPR.
Nonetheless, PI-induced induction of BACE1 accompanies
increased BACE1 activity, which may alter APP processing
in PI-exposed neurons.
In a previous study, Lan et al81 showed PIs, including
ritonavir and saquinavir, modestly inhibited Ab degradation
in human macrophages, and decreased Ab40 and BACE1 in
human cortical neurons, whereas oral dosing with other PIs,
nelfinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir, did not affect Ab accumu-
lation in APP/severe combined immunodeficiency mice.
Although these results appear to contradict our findings,
several caveats must be considered. In that study, Trans-

9 weeks of age, yet the APP severe combined immunode-
ficiency mice (BALB/cBy-Prkdcscid crossed with CRND8)
displayed no overt amyloid pathology at 12 weeks of age.
Thus, inclusion of age-matched, CRND8 controls was

mice
occurred
in
a
similar,
time-
dependent manner. Second, concentrations of PIs tested in
human fetal neurons were 2.5- to 5-fold greater than the
highest concentrations of PIs tested in our experiments, and
ARV concentrations tested on purified BACE1 protein
in vitro were up to 30-fold greater than those used in our
studies. Finally, we found that PIs had the greatest effect on
Ab42 production, whereas this was not tested by Lan et al.81
Notably, we found that ARVs at levels similar to those used
by Lan et al80 were highly neurotoxic, even at time points
earlier than 16 hours. Thus, further investigation is needed
to resolve these findings.
Unlike a- or g-secretases, BACE1 is translationally
repressed
under
basal
conditions
but
is
selectively
up-regulated during ER and oxidative stress; thus, we hy-
pothesized a protective role for BACE1 in cellular stress
adaptation and/or survival. In fact, BACE1-mediated Ab
was protective against neuronal hyperactivity/excitotoxicity
in vitro.82 However, our findings suggest that BACE1 may
contribute to neuronal damage during ER stress over
48 hours, and raise questions regarding BACE1’s physio-
logical functions in neurons, which remain largely elusive.
BACE1 has been implicated in myelination via cleavage
of neuregulin-1 and in maintenance of synaptic func-
tioning.38,83 BACE1 is also up-regulated in neurons in
response to a host of inflammatory mediators, including
interferon-g, tumor necrosis factor-a, and Ab, and contains
transcription factor binding sites for specificity protein 1
(Sp1), cAMP reponse element binding protein (CREB), and
NF-kB, among others. These aspects of BACE1 need to be
further investigated in future in vivo studies.
Based on our findings and previous reports, neuronal
BACE1 up-regulation may be deleterious to cell survival
during stress conditions. However, the cellular context of
the specific stressor may be the critical determinant. As
shown by Baleriola et al,84 Ab42 can induce p-eIF2a
accumulation and local translation of a subset of mRNAs,
including ATF4, when applied to distal rat hippocampal
neuronal axons. ATF4, typically considered neuroprotective
in cellular adaption to ER stress, was shown to propagate a
neurodegenerative signaling cascade in Ab42-treated neu-
rons, leading to cell death. Thus, stress-induced genes, such
as ATF4 and BACE1, that are translationally up-regulated
in response to elevated p-eIF2a detected in HAND and
AD CNS34,84,85 may be playing dual roles in neuronal
viability, depending on stressor chronicity and localization.
In addition, viral infection and inflammation are well-known
UPR inducers.30,86 Furthermore, BACE1 expression is
largely limited to neurons, whereas p-eIF2a is ubiquitous;
changes in p-eIF2a might be masked in the cellular extracts
containing all cell types. Overall, these factors may account
for our in vivo findings showing p-eIF2a elevation in SIVþ/
placebo macaques, but not in ART-treated animals. These
caveats should be examined in careful time-course experi-
ments. Although our data suggest PI-mediated BACE1
up-regulation with concomitant functional activation, the
implications of increased Ab, an intriguing question beyond
the scope of the current study, will be investigated in future
studies.

 yielded conflicting results. Green et al5 were the first to
show increased APP accumulation, primarily intraneuronal,
and amyloid-associated pathology in ARV-treated, HIVþ
individuals compared to ARV-naïve, HIVþ patients; these
findings were confirmed by Xu and Ikezu,11 who observed
intraneuronal Ab immunoreactivity and Ab plaques in
ARV-treated, HIV encephalitic brains but only intra-
neuronal Ab in ARV-untreated, HAD brains, with no evi-
dence of extracellular deposition. One major caveat in these
studies is the pathological effects associated with variables
such as comorbidities, drug abuse, and potential ARV-
mediated adverse effects. Thus, our studies in pigtailed
macaque and rodent models of chronic ARV drug exposure
were designed to tease out these confounders. In addition to
increased hippocampal synaptodendritic damage we previ-
ously observed in ARV-treated SIVþ macaques, we herein
report elevated neuronal APP and BACE1 in the same
cohort. Elevated APP has been previously reported to be
associated with increased neuronal injury58; however,
numerous reports indicate that this might be a neuro-
protective response.87,88 In addition, roles for APP in syn-
aptogenesis suggest that elevated APP may be an attempt at
neuronal repair. Thus, our observation that altered APP
levels among our treatment groups may be difficult to
interpret. In addition, several caveats must be considered.
First, the time to euthanasia was different between SIVþ/
placebo and SIVþ/ART groups, as these cohorts were
originally designed to address a distinct question regarding
use of ARVs. Second, SIVþ/ART macaques harbored
persistent CNS viral DNA, although it was not clear if it was
replication competent.43 Finally, this retrospective study did
not include an SIV�/ART control group to more effectively
account for ARV effects in the absence of virus. Future
studies with SIV�/ART animals will be invaluable for
isolating viral contribution to CNS damage from that of
ARVs. More important, ARV concentrations in that model
closely reflect dose ranges measured in human plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid.43
Similar to our observations in SIVþ/ART macaques,
adult mice in our rodent model of chronic ARV exposure
displayed increased hippocampal BACE1 expression, indi-
cating virus-independent, ARV-mediated CNS BACE1
up-regulation. However, unlike ART-treated macaques,
ARV-treated mice had increased p-eIF2a and BiP expres-
sion, likely attributable to the use of different ARVs or
species-specific differences in ARV effects in the hippo-
campus. These results build on our previous studies
showing decreased MAP2 and synaptophysin in ARV-
treated rat hippocampus,23 and taken together with our
macaque data, suggest that ARVs, independent from po-
tential viral effects, induce neuronal damage and UPR
activation in the CNS and may contribute to the neurode-
generative processes associated with HAND.
Although CNS effects of ARVs are still poorly under-
stood, clinical studies have begun to evaluate the effect of
ARV regimens with high CNS penetration on HIVþ
patients. Although numerous studies have shown ARVs’
benefit in improving cognition, others have found a signif-
icant association between ARV regimens with high CNS
penetration effectiveness scores and worse neurocognitive
performance.3,53e55,89e96
Inherent
and
significant
con-
founders in these studies are the variation in blood-brain
barrier permeability among different ARVs, CNS viral
load persistence, and the resulting difficulty in distinguish-
ing neurotoxicity of HIV from that of ARVs. ARV drugs
vary
in
their
physicochemical
properties,
particularly
regarding their blood-brain barrier permeability; however,
extensive evidence demonstrates increased CNS entry of
small molecules and serum proteins after HIV-mediated
disruption of blood-brain barrier endothelial cells and tight
junctions.97e100 Thus, higher-than-anticipated concentra-
tions of ARV drugs may be occurring in HIVþ patients with
a compromised blood-brain barrier. Notably, pharmacoki-
netic analysis of ARVs in guinea pigs revealed significantly
higher uptake of [3H]-ritonavir into brain parenchyma
compared to cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that clinical
estimates of CNS penetrance for PIs may be lower than
actual
CNS
drug
concentrations.63
In
addition
to
uncertainties in ARV CNS penetration with currently pre-
scribed regimens, efforts to enhance ARV delivery to the
CNS via nanotherapeutics necessitate a careful examination
of their potential neurotoxic effects.
Although ARV concentrations used herein were signifi-
cantly higher than peak CNS levels measured in patients,
their effects on neuroglial cultures are likely to occur over
long-term exposures in vivo. We sought to model their
chronic, low-dose effects in a more acute time frame with
higher doses. Our results indicated that PIs, at nanomolar
concentrations, robustly activated the UPR in primary
cortical neurons, leading to PERK-dependent increases in
p-eIF2a and BACE1 translational up-regulation. ARVs,
either alone or in combination, also increased Ab production
in multiple cell types, which was dose-dependently blocked
by a cell-permeable BACE1 inhibitor. Taken together with
our previous reports of elevated BiP, p-eIF2a, and ATF6 in
HAND tissue, these data strongly suggest a role for UPR in
CNS HIV pathogenesis. These results bear striking simi-
larities to observations made in AD, Parkinson disease,
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases in which
UPR markers, including phospho-PERK, are elevated in
multiple brain regions. Although transient eIF2a phos-
phorylation is protective during ER stress, sustained global
protein synthesis suppression in the CNS may ultimately
lead to impaired long-term potentiation and synaptic failure.
However, promising therapeutics targeted at the UPR have
already been reported. Several studies showed genetic and
pharmacological suppression of PERK activity decreased
p-eIF2a expression, improved synaptic plasticity, and
rescued memory deficits in an AD mouse model, and alle-
viated prion-mediated pathology and cognitive deficits in
prion proteineinoculated mice.86,101 In addition, BACE1
inhibitors, which are currently being aggressively pursued in

 clinical trials, may have therapeutic benefits in patients
experiencing
HAND.83
Future
investigations
will
be
necessary to determine the role of BACE1 in UPR. We also
propose to investigate ARVs’ potential effects on BACE1
redistribution to the trans-Golgi network and early endo-
somal compartments as a mechanism of increased APP
processing, similar to what was shown by Tan et al.75 Such
approaches, in a precision medicine setting, will aid the
clinicians in determining the most efficient ART regimens
with minimal adverse effects that can be reinforced with the
most appropriate adjunctive therapeutic approaches, such as
BACE1 inhibitors.
