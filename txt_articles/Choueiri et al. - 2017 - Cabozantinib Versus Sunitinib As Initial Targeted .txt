Purpose
Cabozantinib is an oral potent inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, MET, and
AXL and is a standard second-line therapy for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). This ran-
domized phase II multicenter trial evaluated cabozantinib compared with sunitinib as first-line
therapy in patients with mRCC.
Patients and Methods
Eligible patients had untreated clear cell mRCC and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group perfor-
mance status of 0 to 2 and were intermediate or poor risk per International Metastatic Renal Cell
Carcinoma Database Consortium criteria. Patients were randomly assigned at a one-to-one ratio to
cabozantinib (60 mg once per day) or sunitinib (50 mg once per day; 4 weeks on, 2 weeks off).
Progression-free survival (PFS) was the primary end point. Objective response rate (ORR), overall
survival, and safety were secondary end points.
Results
From July 2013 to April 2015, 157 patients were randomly assigned (cabozantinib, n = 79; sunitinib,
n = 78). Compared with sunitinib, cabozantinib treatment significantly increased median PFS (8.2 v
5.6 months) and was associated with a 34% reduction in rate of progression or death (adjusted
hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.95; one-sided P = .012). ORR was 33% (95% CI, 23% to 44%)
for cabozantinib versus 12% (95% CI, 5.4% to 21%) for sunitinib. All-causality grade 3 or 4 adverse
events were 67% for cabozantinib and 68% for sunitinib and included diarrhea (cabozantinib, 10% v
sunitinib, 11%), fatigue (6% v 15%), hypertension (28% v 22%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia
(8% v 4%), and hematologic adverse events (3% v 22%).
Conclusion
Cabozantinib demonstrated a significant clinical benefit in PFS and ORR over standard-of-care
sunitinib as first-line therapy in patients with intermediate- or poor-risk mRCC.

INTRODUCTION
Metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC)
remains largely incurable. However, prognosis
of patients with metastatic disease varies widely
depending on well-characterized risk factors.
The International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma
Database Consortium (IMDC)1 and the Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)2 have
developed prognostic criteria to classify patients
with metastatic RCC (mRCC) into risk cate-
gories on the basis of pretreatment character-
istics. Poor- and intermediate-risk groups have
inferior clinical outcomes in terms of overall
survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS),
and response to antiangiogenic agents when com-
pared with favorable-risk patients.
Antiangiogenic agents that target the vas-
cular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its
receptors are standard treatments based on im-
proved clinical outcomes in randomized phase
III trials.3,4 Sunitinib is a common first-line
therapy for patients with mRCC and serves as
the control arm of several ongoing randomized
phase III trials in untreated patients with ad-
vanced disease.5,6 Median PFS in patients with
advanced RCC ranges from 8 to 11 months for

 first-line sunitinib or pazopanib for the entire patient population as
reported in clinical trials,7-9 but it has been estimated to be 5.6 months
for first-line targeted therapy (primarily VEGF-targeted therapies)
when the population is restricted to intermediate- or poor-risk pa-
tients on the basis of data from the IMDC.10
Most patients treated with a VEGF-targeted agent ultimately
develop resistance as evidenced by disease progression. Like
VEGF, both MET and AXL are upregulated in von Hippel-
Lindau–deficient RCC cells as a result of the control of their
expression by hypoxia-inducible factors.11-14 High expression of
METor AXL is associated with poor prognosis15,16 and resistance
to VEGF receptor (VEGFR) inhibitors in preclinical models of
several cancers, including RCC.17,18 Given the known oncogenic
potential of MET and AXL and their upregulation along with
VEGF as part of the underlying pathobiology of RCC, targeting
these two oncoproteins in addition to VEGFRs may provide
additional anticancer effects in patients with RCC over more
selective VEGFR-inhibition strategies.
Cabozantinib, an oral small-molecule inhibitor of tyrosine
kinases, including VEGFRs, MET, and AXL,19 was recently ap-
proved for the treatment of patients with RCC who have received
prior antiangiogenic therapy on the basis of a phase III trial
(METEOR; Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Phase III Study
Evaluating Cabozantinib Vs Everolimus) showing an improve-
ment in PFS, objective response rate (ORR), and OS compared
with everolimus.20,21 Here, we report the results of Alliance for
Clinical Trials in Oncology study A031203, a randomized, open-
label phase II trial comparing cabozantinib with standard-of-care
sunitinib in IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk patients with
advanced RCC in the first-line setting.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Patients
Eligible patients were 18 years of age or older with advanced RCC or
mRCC (not amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy) with a clear cell
component and measurable disease. Patients must have been classified as
intermediate or poor risk by IMDC criteria1 and must not have received
prior systemic treatment. Patients with known brain metastases who were
adequately treated and stable for 3 months were eligible. Eligible patients
also had to have Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) perfor-
mance status (PS) of 0 to 2 and adequate end-organ and marrow function
with no uncontrolled significant illness.
Treatment Assignment
Patients were randomly assigned at a one-to-one allocation ratio to
receive either cabozantinib or sunitinib. Random assignment was stratified
by IMDC risk category (intermediate or poor) and presence of bone
metastases (yes or no) using the dynamic allocation method.
Cabozantinib was provided by Exelixis (South San Francisco, CA)
and administered orally once per day at a dose of 60 mg. Sunitinib was
available as part of standard of care and administered orally once per day
at a dose of 50 mg for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week break. A treatment
cycle was defined as 6 weeks in both study groups. Adverse events were
managed with treatment interruptions and dose reductions. Cabo-
zantinib dose reductions were to 40 and 20 mg, and sunitinib dose
reductions were to 37.5 and 25 mg. Treatment was continued until
disease progression, intolerance to therapy, or withdrawal of consent for
treatment. Crossover between treatment arms was not prescribed by the
protocol.
End Points and Assessments
The primary end point was duration of PFS, defined as the interval
between the dates of random assignment and first documentation of
disease progression (investigator assessed) or death resulting from any
cause. Secondary end points were OS, ORR, and safety. OS was defined
from the date of random assignment to the date of death resulting from any
cause. Tumor response and progression were assessed in all patients by
computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging scans using
RECIST (version 1.1)22 at screening and every 12 weeks (two treat-
ment cycles) after random assignment until progression. Classifica-
tion as a complete or partial response for calculation of ORR required
confirmation at greater than 4 weeks after the first identified re-
sponse. Routine safety evaluations were performed and adverse event
severity grades were assessed by the investigator using the National
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(version 4.0).23
Study Oversight
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board or ethics
committee at each center, and the study was conducted in accordance with
Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Each
participant signed an institutional review board–approved, protocol-
specific informed consent form in accordance with federal and institu-
tional guidelines. Safety was monitored by an independent data moni-
toring committee on a regular basis. Data were collected by the Alliance for
Clinical Trials in Oncology, reviewed by the study chair (T.K.C.), and
analyzed in collaboration with the authors. The authors vouch for the
accuracy and completeness of the data and the fidelity of the study to the
protocol. The first draft of the manuscript was written by the first author,
with all authors contributing to subsequent drafts. All authors agreed to
submit the manuscript for publication. The study protocol is available at
the journal Web site.
Study Design and Data Analysis
The study was designed to evaluate whether cabozantinib increased
PFS compared with sunitinib in the target population. The planned sample
size to evaluate PFS (the primary end point) was 140 randomly assigned
patients. The null hypothesis was that the hazard ratio (HR) of progression
of the two treatment arms would be 1.0; the alternative hypothesis was that
the HR would be 0.67, favoring the experimental arm (cabozantinib) over
the control arm (sunitinib). With 123 events (progressions or deaths), the
log-rank statistic had 85% power to detect an HR of 0.67 for PFS,
assuming a one-sided type I error of 0.12 (equivalent to an increase in
median PFS from 8 months in the sunitinib arm to 12 months in the
cabozantinib arm). The one-sided test corresponded to the one- sided
study hypothesis. The following assumptions were made to achieve the
target of 123 PFS events: an accrual rate of 5.8 patients per month over
a 24-month enrollment period, 20 months of follow-up after study closure
for the PFS end point, and an exponential distribution of PFS. Allowing for
a 7% ineligibility rate, the total sample size was 150 patients.
A futility analysis was conducted for the PFS end point. The final
analysis was performed when 123 PFS events had been observed, and the
data base for the primary end point was locked on April 11, 2016. Analysis
of OS was performed with a data base lock of September 15, 2016. The
primary analysis of the PFS end point was based on a one-sided stratified
log-rank test for treatment effect, adjusting for the stratification factors. In
addition, the proportional hazards model was used to perform exploratory
analyses to assess the importance of the treatment effect in predicting PFS
in subgroup analyses. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate OS
and PFS distributions by treatment arm. An intent-to-treat approach was
used for the analyses of all clinical outcomes except safety, where patients
who received at least one dose of study drug were included.
All analyses were performed using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
R software. The study was designed by the Alliance for Clinical Trials
in Oncology, endorsed by the ECOG–American College of Radiology

RESULTS
Patients
From July 9, 2013, to April 6, 2015, 157 patients were ran-
domly assigned to receive cabozantinib (n = 79) or sunitinib
(n = 78). Overall, the treatment groups were balanced with respect
to baseline demographic and disease characteristics (Table 1).
Eighty-one percent of enrolled patients were classified as IMDC
intermediate risk and 19% as poor risk, and 36% of patients had
bone metastases.
As of the data cutoff date for the primary end point of PFS of
April 11, 2016, 13 patients treated with cabozantinib and two
treated with sunitinib were continuing to receive study treatment.
The most common reason for discontinuing treatment was ra-
diographic disease progression for both treatment groups (Fig 1).
Efficacy
The analysis of the primary end point of PFS was conducted
after the required 123 events had occurred. Median PFS was
8.2 months (95% CI, 6.2 to 8.8 months) with cabozantinib and
5.6 months (95% CI, 3.4 to 8.1 months) with sunitinib. Cabo-
zantinib reduced the rate of disease progression or death by 34%
compared with sunitinib (adjusted HR for progression or death,
0.66, 95%, CI 0.46 to 0.95; one-sided P = .012; Fig 2). Subgroup
analyses by stratification factors (IMDC risk groups and presence
or absence of bone metastases) consistently favored cabozantinib
(Appendix Fig A1, online only).
Cabozantinib was associated with a significant improvement
in ORR, as assessed by investigator review. Complete or partial
responses were confirmed in 26 patients (33%; 95% CI, 23% to
44%) in the cabozantinib group compared with 9 patients (12%;
95% CI, 5.4% to 21%) in the sunitinib group (Table 2). A best
response of stable disease occurred in 36 patients (46%) with

Cabozantinib Versus Sunitinib in Metastatic RCC
 cabozantinib versus 33 patients (42%) with sunitinib, and pro-
gressive disease as best response occurred in 14 patients (18%) with
cabozantinib versus 20 patients (26%) with sunitinib. Any re-
duction in target lesions was observed for 87% of the cabozantinib
group and 44% of the sunitinib group (Fig 3).
As of September 15, 2016, the median follow-up of surviving
patients was 21.4 months. Overall, 37 deaths had occurred in the
cabozantinib arm and 41 in the sunitinib arm. Median OS with
cabozantinib was 30.3 months (95% CI, 14.6 to 35.0 months) versus
21.8 months (95% CI, 16.3 to 27.0 months) with sunitinib (adjusted
HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.50 to 1.26; Fig 4). Subsequent anticancer
therapy was received by 52% of patients in the cabozantinib group
and 58% of patients in the sunitinib group and included systemic
therapies (cabozantinib, 47% v sunitinib, 60%), radiotherapy (8% v
18%), and surgery (6% v 4%; Appendix Table A1, online only).
Safety
The safety population consisted of 78 patients treated with
cabozantinib and 72 treated with sunitinib. Median number of
6-week treatment cycles was five (range, zero to 19) among patients
who received cabozantinib and two (range, zero to 17) among
patients who received sunitinib, corresponding to 6.9 months
(range, 0 to 26.2 months) and 2.8 months (range, 0 to 23.5
months), respectively. Dose reductions occurred in 36 patients
(46%) treated with cabozantinib and 25 patients (35%) treated
with sunitinib. The rate of treatment discontinuation because of
adverse events was 20% (n = 16) and 21% (n = 16) in the
cabozantinib and sunitinib groups, respectively.
The incidence of adverse events (any grade) regardless of
causality was 99% with cabozantinib and 99% with sunitinib, and
the incidence of grade 3 or 4 adverse events was 67% with
cabozantinib and 68% with sunitinib (Table 3). The most common
grade 3 or 4 adverse events with cabozantinib were hypertension
(28%), diarrhea (10%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (8%),
and fatigue (6%); with sunitinib, they were hypertension (22%),
fatigue (15%), diarrhea (11%), and thrombocytopenia (11%).
Grade 5 adverse events occurred in four patients (5%) in the
cabozantinib group and five patients (7%) in the sunitinib group.
Treatment-related grade 5 events occurred in three patients in the
cabozantinib group (acute kidney injury, sepsis, and jejunal per-
foration) and three patients in the sunitinib group (sepsis, re-
spiratory failure, and vascular disorders).
DISCUSSION
Cabozantinib improved PFS and response rate compared with
sunitinib in this randomized phase II trial of IMDC intermediate-
and poor-risk patients with RCC who were previously untreated
with systemic agents. The efficacy of cabozantinib was notable and
clinically meaningful, with an observed median PFS of 8.2 months
compared with 5.6 months with sunitinib and an HR of 0.66,
corresponding to a 34% reduction in the rate of disease progression
or death. Objective tumor responses were higher with cabozantinib
(33%) compared with sunitinib (12%). Preliminary data on OS
showed a 20% decrease in the rate of death with cabozantinib.
The study was not designed to test for differences in OS,
a secondary end point of the trial. Further follow-up will provide
more mature OS results. Approximately half of all patients received
subsequent anticancer therapy, with a similar percentage receiving
therapy in both treatment groups. Therefore, subsequent therapy
would not be expected to confound the OS results.
The safety profiles of cabozantinib and sunitinib in this trial
were consistent with prior experience in this patient population.8,20,21
Common adverse events with cabozantinib included fatigue, hy-
pertension, diarrhea, abnormal liver function tests, anorexia, and
palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome. These adverse effects
have also been observed with other VEGFR tyrosine kinase in-
hibitors in patients with RCC.24 Adverse events observed with
sunitinib were similar to those with cabozantinib overall, but with
lower rates of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, weight
loss, and anorexia and higher rates of hematologic toxicities such
as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Dose reductions were
common with both agents, reflecting a strategy to titrate the
agents to individual tolerability. The rate of discontinuation of
study treatment because of adverse events was also similar in both
arms. High-grade adverse events irrespective of causality were

 similar in both arms and consistent with prior reports for
cabozantinib and sunitinib.
Sunitinib was used as the comparator because it is a standard
first-line treatment.3,4 Pazopanib, another VEGFR-targeted therapy
that was found to be noninferior to sunitinib in the COMPARZ
(Comparing the Efficacy Safety and Tolerability of Pazopanib Versus
Sunitinib) trial,7 could have been an alternative choice as a com-
parator. We focused on IMDC intermediate- and poor-risk groups
because these groups would capture 70% to 80% of all patients with
advanced disease who are the most in need of systemic therapy and
disease control, whereas the favorable-risk group includes many
patients with relatively indolent, lower-volume disease.10,25
In addition to including poor- and intermediate-risk groups,
our patient population had a high rate of bone metastases, a known
negative prognostic factor in RCC. As shown in a recent large
French study, patients with RCC with bone metastases had a re-
duced benefit from sunitinib, even when adjusting for known
prognostic factors in advanced RCC.26 Similar findings were seen
in a study from the IMDC as well as in an analysis using pooled
data from six prospective clinical trials.27,28 In contrast, encour-
aging clinical activity with cabozantinib in patients with RCC with
bone metastases was observed in the phase III METEOR trial,21
where a marked improvement in PFS and OS in patients with bone
metastases was observed with cabozantinib compared with ever-
olimus. In our study, we conducted subgroup analyses in patients
with bone metastases versus without bone metastases (as well
as poor v intermediate risk) and observed a PFS benefit with
cabozantinib in all subgroups of patients, consistent with the
overall results. However, these analyses were limited by the
small number of patients in each subgroup.
Median PFS and the ORR estimated for sunitinib in our study,
5.6 months and 18%, respectively, were lower than those reported
in previous trials that included patients of all risk groups, including
favorable risk.7,8 For example, median PFS per investigator was
10.2 months and ORR per investigator was 29% with sunitinib in
the COMPARZ trial.7 The lower values for sunitinib in our study
are consistent with the less favorable prognosis of our study
population. In our study, no patients were favorable risk, 13% had
an ECOG PS of 2, and 36% had bone metastases. In comparison,
the sunitinib group in the COMPARZ trial consisted of 25%
favorable-risk patients, none had an ECOG PS of 2, and only 15%
of patients had bone metastases. Consistent with our results, an
analysis from the IMDC including only intermediate- and poor-
risk patients estimated a median PFS of 5.6 months for patients
with RCC treated with first-line targeted therapy.10
The superiority of cabozantinib over sunitinib may reflect the
target profile of cabozantinib, which includes MET and AXL in
addition to VEGFR. Further investigation of biomarkers may help
to clearly define the roles of these targets in the clinical activity of
cabozantinib. Analysis of METexpression is ongoing; however, the
role of MET tumor expression was investigated in the METEOR
trial and was not found to be predictive of the clinical activity of
cabozantinib over everolimus.21 Future studies should investigate
additional blood and tissue biomarkers that might indicate re-
sponse with cabozantinib in patients with RCC. Furthermore,
given the recent demonstration of improved OS with cabozanti-
nib21 or nivolumab29 compared with everolimus in two phase III
studies in second-line RCC and the immunomodulatory effects of
cabozantinib in the tumor microenvironment,30 evaluation of the
combination of cabozantinib with immune checkpoint inhibition
is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02496208).31
Our study results show for the first time to our knowledge
an agent that demonstrates clinical superiority over sunitinib,
an established standard of care for more than 10 years. Never-
theless, our study has some limitations. The study did not include
favorable-risk patients, and at this time, extrapolation of our
findings to the favorable-risk population is not possible. How-
ever, there is no clinical or biologic rationale to support cabo-
zantinib being inferior to sunitinib in that subgroup. Second, this
study did not collect quality-of-life data. With relatively similar
toxicity profiles, quality of life might be expected to be com-
parable between the two agents, although the sunitinib schedule

Cabozantinib Versus Sunitinib in Metastatic RCC
 could be favored because it includes a 2-week off-therapy break.
Finally, central imaging review was not performed in our open-
label study; however, results on the basis of central image review
and investigator assessments led to similar efficacy conclusions
in the phase III METEOR trial comparing cabozantinib with
everolimus.21
In conclusion, cabozantinib demonstrated significant im-
provements in PFS and ORR relative to sunitinib in the initial
treatment of patients with intermediate- or poor-risk clear cell mRCC.
Therefore, cabozantinib represents a potential new treatment
option for patients with previously untreated mRCC.
