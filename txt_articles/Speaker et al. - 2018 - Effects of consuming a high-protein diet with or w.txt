Summary
Objective
This 12-month randomized, non-inferiority clinical trial sought to determine the impact of
consuming soy protein as part of an energy-restricted, high-protein diet on weight loss,
body composition and cardiometabolic health.
Methods
Seventy-one adults (58 female) with overweight or obesity (body mass index:
32.9 ± 3.6 kg m�2) were randomly assigned to consume three servings of soy (S) or
non-soy (NS) protein foods per day for 12 months. All participants completed a group-
based behavioural weight loss program lasting 4 months (M4), and follow-up assess-
ments were completed at month 12 (M12).
Results
Body weight was reduced in both groups at M4 (S: �7.0% ± 5.2%, NS: �7.1% ± 5.7%)
and M12 (S: 3.6% ± 5.1%, NS: �4.8% ± 7.3%). Body weight reductions (mean difference
[90% confidence interval]) were not different between S and NS at either time point (M4:
�0.16% [�1.4, 3.6], P = 0.90; M12: 1.1% [�1.4, 3.6], P = 0.44). Differences in body fat
mass loss were not different between S and NS at M4 (0.29 ± 0.84 kg, P = 0.73) or
M12 (0.78 ± 1.5 kg, P = 0.59). Weight loss-induced improvements in cholesterol,
triglycerides and blood pressure did not differ between S and NS.
Conclusion
These results indicate that soy-based protein foods can be effectively incorporated into
an energy-restricted, high-protein diet for improving body weight, body composition and
cardiometabolic health.
Keywords: Body composition, dietary protein, obesity, weight loss.
Introduction
Higher protein (HP) diets may help with weight loss by
increasing satiety, increasing energy expenditure and
promoting greater loss of fat vs. fat-free mass compared
with lower or normal protein diets that provide dietary
protein at or near the current Recommended Daily Allow-
ance of 0.8 g of protein per kg of body weight (1–4). It was
previously reported that a HP diet that included lean beef
was as effective as a HP diet without beef in producing
weight loss while preserving fat free mass and improving
cardiometabolic health (5). Whether weight loss is im-
pacted by the source of protein has not be exhaustively
studied, and some evidence indicates that proteins from
animal vs. plant sources may differentially impact appetite
and eating behaviour (6).
Some previous studies have investigated the impact of
animal vs. plant-based HP diets on weight loss, appetite
and ingestive behaviour, and cardiovascular disease risk
factors (7–10). In general, findings from these studies

 support a broadly beneficial impact of HP diets with lim-
ited differences between animal-based and plant-based
diets (7). Interest in plant-based diets, however, is on
the rise as evidenced by the 2015–2020 Dietary Guide-
lines for Americans, which call for an increase in the con-
sumption and variety of vegetables and protein foods
including soy products (11). Therefore, more studies are
warranted to investigate the potential impact of using
non-animal protein sources to meet dietary protein in-
takes, especially for HP diets for weight loss. Such find-
ings would provide individuals with greater dietary
flexibility for following HP diets, which are common for
weight management.
Soy foods are a uniquely rich source of high quality pro-
tein and bioactive plant compounds that have been studied
for their association with cardiometabolic health ranging
from improvements in blood lipid profiles to preferential re-
ductions in body fat (12–15). Short-term studies have also
found that soy proteins elicit similar satiety and appetite-
related hormone responses as animal-based proteins (6),
which supports the potential role of consuming soy pro-
teins as part of a HP diet for weight loss. Limited data,
however, are available concerning the impact of HP diets
containing large amounts of soy on weight loss and its ef-
fects on key biomarkers of cardiometabolic health. Soy
protein represents a potentially attractive plant-based
protein for research because it is generally regarded as
the highest quality plant protein (16). This research is par-
ticularly important for vegetarians and/or vegans, who
may experience greater difficulty in adhering to HP diets
due to fewer dietary protein options compared with those
following an omnivorous diet. The primary aim of this trial
was to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of
incorporating soy protein-based foods compared with
other proteins into high-protein diets for weight loss.
Secondary aims were to assess whether soy protein
foods consumed as part of an energy-restricted, HP diet
influenced changes in body composition or cardiometa-
bolic health.
Unlike trials designed to test superiority of a treatment
compared with a placebo or control group, non-inferiority
trials are designed to test the comparative effectiveness
of a new intervention or treatment and established
intervention or treatment options (17). Increasing empha-
sis has been placed on the use of non-inferiority designs
because assigning patients to a placebo can often be
unethical, costly and potentially unnecessary given the
research question at hand. This study was thus designed
as a non-inferiority trial to evaluate and compare two
active dietary treatment arms for their effectiveness in
promoting weight loss. It was hypothesized that weight
change at the end of a 4-month comprehensive weight
loss program would not differ (defined by a non-inferiority
margin of Δ ≤ 3%) between HP diets with soy or non-soy
proteins.
Methods
Participants
Eighty-five individuals were recruited from the Denver,
CO metropolitan area to participate in this randomized
weight loss trial. Participants were first screened by
phone based on the following inclusion criteria: men and
women aged 18–55 years, body mass index (BMI)
27–40 kg m�2, weight stable (Δ ≤ 4.5 kg in last 3 months),
generally healthy, able to progress in an exercise program
up to 70 min 6 d per week at a moderate intensity.
Subjects also had to be willing and able to participate in
group classes held once per week for 16 consecutive
weeks and willing to participate in five study visits
(screening, baseline, month 4 [M4], month 8 and month
12 [M12]) over the study period. All study visits and group
weight loss classes were conducted at the University of
Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center in Aurora,
CO, between February 2015 and October 2016. All
protocols were reviewed and approved by the Western
Institutional Review Board (Olympia, WA). Participants
provided
written
informed
consent
and
received
a
monetary stipend for participating in the study.
Experimental design
A non-blinded, two-arm, block randomized controlled trial
was used to investigate the relative efficacy of consuming
soy vs. non-soy protein foods as part of a HP diet
consumed during 4 months of voluntary weight loss and
8 months of weight loss maintenance. All participants
participated in the State of Slim (SOS) weight manage-
ment program, which is a 16-week group-based, lifestyle
modification program (5,18). The SOS program consisted
of weekly classes of 20 participants that were stratified by
diet assignment. A copy of the SOS book and access to
the online SOS community were provided to all partici-
pants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of
two experimental diets: a HP including three daily soy
protein products (S) or a HP diet that was restricted in
soy protein products (NS).
Diet intervention
The SOS diet plan is HP, low in fat and emphasizes non-
starchy (i.e. vegetable) and whole-grain carbohydrates.
Protein foods throughout the entire SOS program are lean
and minimally processed (i.e. lean meat and poultry, fish,
egg whites and fat-free dairy). The diet plan is structured

 into three distinct phases with phase-specific food
choices from which participants can chose to eat in
defined portions rather than counting calories. Prescribed
food lists, portion sizes for the SOS diet plan and
additional
details
of
the
SOS
weight
management
program have been published previously (5). All partici-
pants were provided with a SOS book and instructed to
select foods from the list for each diet phase with
additional group-specific instructions as described in
the succeeding texts. Participants assigned to S were
provided with three pre-made, soy protein food products
to consume each day for the duration of the 12-month
study period. These soy products consisted of a packet
of protein powder, a protein bar and a frozen protein patty
(similar to a sausage patty). The SOS program recom-
mends consuming a five to six meals per day with a serv-
ing at each meal. Thus, participants assigned to S were
given enough soy protein products to provide 50–60%
of their prescribed daily protein intake. The remaining
40–50% of dietary protein was to be self-chosen from
the SOS food lists provided in the book, which includes
both
animal-based
and
vegetarian
dietary
protein
options. Participants assigned to NS were asked to
consume three servings of self-selected soy-free protein
products each day for the duration of the study period.
NS
participants
were
given
monetary
stipends
at
baseline, M4 and month 8 study visits to purchase soy-
free, SOS-approved protein powders and bars.
Following the completion of the 16-week SOS program
and M4 testing day, participants initiated the 8-month
weight loss maintenance phase of the study. The follow-
ing recommendations for weight loss maintenance were
given during weeks 15 and 16 of the SOS program: (1)
eat high quality foods most of the time (i.e. follow Phase
3 of the dietary program 80% of the time); (2) keep your
activity level high (i.e. 70 min d�1 and 6 d week�1); (3)
weigh yourself every day; (4) set a ‘take action’ weight
(i.e. a weight at which one would re-engage weight loss
efforts); and (5) be a role model. No additional touchpoints
or interventions were made during the maintenance
period of the study outside of on-site study assessments
at months 8 and 12 and the in-person distribution of
additional soy products at months 6 and 10.
Because the hypothesis was that weight loss would be
similar between the S and NS groups, a non-inferiority
research design was used. The primary outcome was
change in body weight at the end of weight loss (M4). A
non-inferiority margin of 3% was set for the upper bound
of the confidence interval (CI) for the mean difference in
per cent weight loss between the two study arms (soy–
non-soy). This margin was chosen based on variation
seen in delivering SOS weight management programs to
over 1,000 subjects over the past 18 months. Differences
in the taste, product selection and appearance of
recommended and/or supplied protein sources precluded
blinding the study. Secondary outcomes included weight
loss maintenance at M12 and changes in body and trunk
composition, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN),
C-reactive protein (CRP), lipids, blood pressure and
physical activity (total metabolic equivalents [METs] per
week) at M4 and M12. This study was registered on
ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02380963).
Dietary compliance
Body weight, total daily protein consumption (average
number of protein servings per day) and supplemental
protein consumption (average number of supplemental
soy or non-soy protein servings per day) were used to
collectively assess adherence to the dietary protocol.
Protein consumption was tracked via daily dietary recall
logs collected weekly during the 4-month weight loss
phase and twice during the maintenance phase (months
8 and 12). Compliance data are summarized as total
protein servings per week and total soy protein servings
per week compared between groups for total protein
and cohorts for soy protein. Fasting BUN is known to
change with altered protein intakes (19) and was used
as a crude marker of dietary protein consumption to
corroborate self-reported protein intake.
Body weight and composition
Fasting body weight was assessed in light clothing, with
no shoes using a Befour PS6600 calibrated digital scale
(Befour, Inc., Saukville, WI, USA). Body composition and
body fat distribution were assessed via dual X-ray
absorptiometry using a Hologic Discovery QDR Series
unit running APEX software version 4.5 (Hologic, Bedford,
MA, USA).
Blood pressure
Blood pressure was assessed manually using a sphyg-
momanometer. Subjects were asked to sit for 5 min prior
to the reading, and measurement was taken with legs
uncrossed. The back and arm were supported during
the measurement, and the same arm was used at each
study visit.
Blood analyses
Blood samples were collected in the fasted state during
each on-site assessment and analysed for a basic
metabolic panel (including glucose and BUN), CRP and
lipids. For the baseline and M4 study visits, lipids were

Per the appropriate testing protocol, blood samples
were collected into red top 6 mL CAT tubes or gold top
5 mL SST tubes, allowed to clot for 60 min at room
temperature and centrifuged for 15 min at 1.3 relative
centrifugal force and 20°C. Samples for obtaining plasma
were collected in heparin-containing 4.5 mL PST tubes
and immediately spun for 15 min at 2.2 relative centrifugal
force and 20°C. All blood samples were analysed at
the University of Colorado Hospital Authority Clinical
Laboratory in Aurora, CO.
Physical activity
Physical activity levels were assessed as total METs of
task per week using the International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ). The validated long format of the
IPAQ is designed to assess self-reported physical activity
across six activity domains (occupational, transport,
yard/garden, household, leisure/volitional exercise and
sitting). Self-reported pace is reported as an estimate of
exercise intensity, which is then used to convert reported
activity minutes into MET estimates (21).
Statistical analyses
Study data were collected and managed using REDCap
electronic data capture tools hosted at University of
Colorado
–
Anschutz
Medical
Campus.
REDCap
(Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-
based application designed to support data capture for
research studies, providing (1) an intuitive interface for
validated data entry; (2) audit trails for tracking data
manipulation and export procedures; (3) automated
export procedures for seamless data downloads to
common statistical packages; and (4) procedures for
importing data from external sources (22).
This study was powered on the intent-to-treat (ITT)
analysis of detecting non-inferiority of soy protein foods
to non-soy protein foods with an a priori non-inferiority
margin of Δ ≤ 3% for relative weight change. To detect
non-inferiority using a one-sided test, a sample size of
30 participants per arm was indicated for 80% power at
5% significance. For ease of clinical interpretation, the
change from baseline at M4 (weight loss) and M12
(maintenance) was used as the primary and secondary
end points for efficacy assessment. Separate analyses
were performed for the weight loss (M4 – baseline) period
and maintenance (M12 – M4) periods. All data and
analyses presented represent the ITT condition. For the
ITT
analysis,
baseline-observation-carry-forward
was
used for missing M4 and 12 end points. A 90% two-sided
CI for the mean difference between the soy and non-soy
groups was calculated at the end of M4 and M12. If the
upper bound of the CI was smaller than the pre-specified
non-inferiority margin of Δ ≤ 3%, non-inferiority would be
established and followed by a test for superiority using
the ordinary null value. For the superiority test, the
minimum detectable effect sizes were 0.63 common
standard deviations for comparing two groups. Because
secondary outcomes were not part of the a priori
hypothesis, no adjustment for multiple comparisons was
made (23,24). All P-values are reported. Descriptive data
are
presented
as
mean
±
standard
deviation
and
outcomes data as mean ± standard error.
To delineate the profile of change in outcome variables
over the entire study period, a linear mixed effects model
was fit, as supportive analyses, to all the data points of
the primary and secondary outcomes with repeated
measures. Independent variables in this model consisted
of the measuring time and dietary treatment indicator as
classification variables and their interaction term. Un-
structured covariance was used in all the mixed model
analyses. Time by group interaction, within-group change
between different time points and between-group differ-
ence at different time points were tested using contrasts.
Results
Study recruitment and retention
Shown in Figure 1, a total of 85 individuals were screened
for this study. Seventy-two of the 85 met the inclusion
criteria and were enrolled. One participant withdrew from
the study prior to randomization for a total of 71 partici-
pants. Thirty-six participants were randomized to the
soy group and 35 to the non-soy group. Of the 71 partic-
ipants enrolled, 80.3% (soy: n = 29; non-soy: n = 28)
completed the weight loss phase (baseline – M4) and
63.4% (soy: n = 21; non-soy: n = 24) completed the entire
trial (baseline – M12). During the weight loss intervention,
2 were lost to follow up (from the soy group) and 12
withdrew consent (five from the soy group and seven
from the non-soy group) with the reasons for dropout
being family, work and time commitment issues (n = 7),
rigour/difficulty of the SOS intervention (n = 2), dislike of
the supplemental soy products (n = 2) and moving out

 of state (n = 1). During the maintenance phase, seven
were lost to follow up (six from the soy group and one
from the non-soy group), one was withdrawn due to
pregnancy (from the non-soy group) and four withdrew
consent (two from soy and two from non-soy). Dropouts
during this time were due to loss of interest/desire to
continue the program (n = 2) and time commitment issues
(n = 2).
Participant characteristics
Baseline demographics and physical characteristics of
the 71 individuals randomized in the study (Table 1) were
similar between intervention groups with the exception of
diastolic blood pressure, which was significantly higher in
the
soy
group
(soy:
77.9
±
7.5
mmHg;
non-soy,
73.9 ± 8.5 mmHg, P = 0.04). Participants were, on
average, 42 ± 9 years old with a BMI of 32.9 ± 3.5, and
82% of the participants were women. Baseline blood
parameters, blood pressure and physical function tests
were reflective of a healthy participant sample.
Dietary compliance
Compliance was assessed based on self-reported total
protein servings per day and average supplemental pro-
tein consumption per day (100% compliance = 3 servings
per day) for the weight loss (112 d) and maintenance
(252 d) phases of the study. Self-reported compliance to
the high-protein dietary protocol (100% compliance = 6
servings per day) was also similar between groups during
the weight loss (soy: 5.2 ± 0.5 servings per day, n = 32;
non-soy: 5.1 ± 0.5 servings per day, n = 34) and mainte-
nance phases (soy: 5.2 ± 0.7 servings per day; non-soy:
4.2 ± 1.3 servings per day). Consumption of supplemental
protein foods (100% compliance = 3 servings per day) in
the soy group averaged 2.4 ± 0.7 servings per day during

 weight loss and 2.5 ± 0.5 servings per day during the
maintenance phase; consumption in the non-soy group
averaged 2.2 ± 0.04 servings per day during weight loss
and 1.9 ± 0.07 servings per day during the maintenance
phase. Completion rate of the food logs was determined
by number of daily logs received divided by total days in
each phase. Completion rates were as follows: soy:
63.9% ± 31.2%; non-soy group 65.1% ± 35.9% during
the weight loss phase; and soy: 54.7% ± 35.9%; non-
soy: 62.5% ± 35.1% during the maintenance phase.
In accordance with the HP diet, BUN levels were
significantly and similarly increased by 3.5–4.0 mg dL�1
from baseline values of 13.8 mg dL�1 in both of the
groupsat M4, and 2.7–3.5 mg dL�1 at M12. No differences
were observed between groups in the amount of change
seen between BUN levels at M4 or M12.
Changes in body weight and body mass index
Absolute (kg) and relative (%) changes in body weight at
the end of M4 and M12 for each of the treatment groups
are shown in Table 2. Both groups lost significant and
similar amounts of body weight at each time point.
Relative to the a priori non-inferiority margin of 3%
(Figure 2), the 90% CIs for the difference in absolute
and relative weight change between groups at the end
of the weight loss intervention (M4) were �2.3, 1.8 kg
(P = 0.84) and �2.0, 2.3% (P = 0.90), respectively. BMI
was reduced at M4 (S: �2.9 ± 0.3 kg m�2, NS:
�2.9 ± 0.3 kg m�2, both P < 0.001) and at M12 (S:
�1.5 ± 0.5 kg m�2, P = 0.002, NS: �2.0 ± 0.5 kg m�2,
P < 0.001) with no differences in BMI reduction between
N and NS (P value for difference at M4 = 0.98 and
M12 = 0.40).
Changes in body composition
Table 3 shows the changes in body fat %, fat mass and
lean mass at M4 and M12. Both groups lost significant
amounts of lean and body fat mass at the end of the
weight loss intervention (M4). No statistical differences
or overall interactions were observed between the groups

the trial.
Changes in cardiometabolic health and physical
activity
Intervention and dietary treatment effects on metabolic,
cardiovascular and physical activity measures are shown
in Table 4. Lipids and blood pressure were similarly
reduced and physical activity similarly increased between
groups at the end of M4. Briefly, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol was reduced by an average of 16 mg dL�1,
total
cholesterol
by
22
mg
dL�1,
triglycerides
by
37 mg dL�1 and systolic and diastolic blood pressure by
4 mmHg; self-reported physical activity increased by 15
METs per week. Although there were no significant
differences or overall interactions between the groups
for any of the outcome measures, CRP was significantly
reduced at M4 and M12 in S only (P < 0.05). Triglycerides,
on the other hand, remained significantly reduced at the
end of the trial only in NS, while total cholesterol remained
reduced in both groups at the end of M12. Glucose and
high-density lipoprotein concentrations were not changed
in either of the groups at any point in the trial.
Discussion
As hypothesized, similar weight loss was observed
between HP, energy-restricted diets with either supple-
mental
soy-protein
based
foods
or
non-soy-based
proteins. The difference between groups was within a
predetermined non-inferiority margin of Δ ≤ 3% for
relative change in body weight following 4 months of
volitional weight loss. Both groups experienced similar
improvements in secondary outcomes such as body
composition, lipids and blood pressure. Some weight
regain
occurred
during
the
self-directed,
8
month
follow-up period, but there were no significant differences
between the dietary treatment groups for any of the
outcome measures throughout the 12-month trial. While
not a fully vegetarian diet, these findings are encouraging
for vegetarians who struggle to consume sufficient
amounts of dietary protein and for those seeking to add
lean sources of high quality plant proteins to their diets
for optimal health and weight management.
A wide range of health benefits is associated with
weight loss in overweight and obese adults; however, a
potential drawback of weight loss can be the accompany-
ing loss of skeletal muscle mass (3). Although this study
was not powered to investigate changes in body compo-
sition and lacked a standard protein diet group, it is worth
noting that, in contrast to the composition of weight loss
observed at M4 (7.8 kg, 83% body fat mass, 17% lean
mass) the composition of weight loss at the end of M12
(�4.6 kg) consisted of 95% body fat and 5% lean mass
(Table 4). Importantly, IPAQ reported increases in physi-
cal activity at both time points did not differ between
groups suggesting that differences in physical activity in
terms of total METs per week did not contribute towards
the outcome results; however, we did not collect detailed
information on exercise type and frequency. While
speculative, these data warrant further investigation as
they suggest that a HP diet may have beneficial effects
on the composition of weight re-gain.
Interest in plant-based diets has increased with the
latest
dietary
recommendations
to
consume
more
vegetables and plant-based foods high in protein such
as soy (11,25). The protein digestibility-corrected amino
acid scores (the most widely recognized and approved
method for evaluating protein quality) for soy protein are
comparable with milk, meat and eggs making it the
highest quality of all the plant proteins (16). Soy protein

 also contains a significant amount of the amino acid
leucine, which has been shown to play a key role in
protein
synthesis
and
muscle
hypertrophy
(26,27).
Notably, the critical threshold of daily leucine consump-
tion associated with muscle health is approximately
3 g d�1 (28,29), and each of the soy products adminis-
tered in this trial contained 1.6 g leucine. The results of
this trial provide evidence that the consumption of foods
high in soy protein is not inferior to other supplemental
protein sources when it comes to changes in lean mass
observed to occur during volitional weight loss and
maintenance. This finding may be especially relevant for
vegetarians who may find it difficult to consume enough
protein
to
meet
the
daily
recommended
intake
of
0.8 g·kg·d and especially that of a high-protein diet
(1.2–1.6 g·kg·d) (30,31).
The regular consumption of soy protein has been
associated with improvements in cardiometabolic health
associated with blood lipids and blood pressure (12,32).
Although no statistical differences in any of the cardio-
metabolic outcomes were observed between the soy
and non-soy groups (Table 4), there was a trend
towards superior improvements in CRP – an inflammatory
biomarker of cardiovascular disease risk (33) – in the soy
group at the end of M4. These data are in corroboration
with those from a similar trial done in older adults
(68 ± 5 years) (34) suggesting a possible benefit of a
reduced calorie, HP diet with soy on inflammation.
Conclusive evidence linking soy food consumption to
improvements in cardiovascular health,
however, is
limited and contradictory because of the high degree of
inter-individual variation in the bioavailability and metabo-
lism of the bioactive constituents in soy foods (14).
There are several strengths of this study including
block randomization stratified by BMI, age and sex; a
reduction in potential bias by using clearly defined

 curriculum for all intervention classes in conjunction
with classes being taught by the same weight loss
coach, in the same room at the same time of day;
and the assessment of a wide range of outcome
variables following weight loss and a period of self-
directed maintenance. In line with other comprehensive
behavioural
weight
loss
trials
of
similar
duration,
approximately 80% of the participants completed the
4-month weight
loss phase of
the trial
and 63%
completed the entire year (35). This is also one of only
a few studies that looks specifically at soy protein during
weight loss.
The main limitation of the study is the lack of normal
protein control groups with and without soy consump-
tion. Such a comparison would allow for a more
complete investigation of the relative influences of
increased overall protein and soy protein specifically on
weight
loss
and
cardiometabolic
health.
Future
researchers should consider these research questions
in their study designs. The principal reliance on self-
reported food logs for tracking soy and non-soy protein
foods is another limitation of the current study. However,
the observed increase in BUN is indicative of an overall
increase in dietary protein intake, which supports the
participants’ compliance with the study prescription on
a broader level. An unforeseen limitation of the study is
the unpreventable use of different methodologies to
assess blood lipids at baseline and M12 (VAP and
LipoProfile) due to the discontinuation of the VAP
method by the laboratory. While overall levels of physical
activity were assessed in terms of METs per week, the
specific details of exercise intensity and type were not
tracked due to the design and approach of the SOS
program. Lastly, as with most weight loss studies,
participants were predominantly middle aged women
(82%), which limit the ability to extrapolate these findings
to men and younger or older women.
In
conclusion,
the
results
of
this
study
provide
evidence that, when consumed as part of a reduced
calorie, high-protein diet, soy protein is acceptably
comparable in efficacy to other proteins for weight
loss
among
healthy,
middle
aged
adults
with
overweight/obesity. These findings may be particularly
useful to those looking to increase their intake of protein
from high-quality, vegetarian sources as part of a high-
protein, reduced calorie diet.
