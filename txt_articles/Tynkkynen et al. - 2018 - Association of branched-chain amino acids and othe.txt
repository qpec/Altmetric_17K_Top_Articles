Abstract
Introduction: Metabolite, lipid, and lipoprotein lipid profiling can provide novel insights into mech-
anisms underlying incident dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.
Methods: We studied eight prospective cohorts with 22,623 participants profiled by nuclear
magnetic resonance or mass spectrometry metabolomics. Four cohorts were used for discovery
with replication undertaken in the other four to avoid false positives. For metabolites that sur-
vived replication, combined association results are presented.
Results: Over 246,698 person-years, 995 and 745 cases of incident dementia and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease were detected, respectively. Three branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, and valine),
creatinine and two very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-specific lipoprotein lipid subclasses were
associated with lower dementia risk. One high density lipoprotein (HDL; the concentration of choles-
terol esters relative to total lipids in large HDL) and one VLDL (total cholesterol to total lipids ratio in
very large VLDL) lipoprotein lipid subclass was associated with increased dementia risk. Branched-
chain amino acids were also associated with decreased Alzheimer’s disease risk and the concentration
of cholesterol esters relative to total lipids in large HDL with increased Alzheimer’s disease risk.
Discussion: Further studies can clarify whether these molecules play a causal role in dementia path-
ogenesis or are merely markers of early pathology.

1. Introduction
Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is a major
public health problem with devastating physical, financial,
and social consequences for patients, their caregivers, fam-
ilies, and society. Worldwide the cost of AD care in 2010
was $604 billion or 1% of the global gross domestic product
[1]. However, despite over two decades of research on animal
models and clinical trials, we still have no effective prevention
or disease-modifying therapy for late-onset clinical dementia
and AD. Dementia is increasingly recognized as a heteroge-
neous syndrome that would be best addressed with a multi-
pronged approach to prevention and treatment, analogous to
the multipronged and individually tailored use of statins, an-
tihypertensives, antiplatelet agents, and vasodilators in per-
sons with coronary artery disease. Identifying novel biology
could suggest new circulating biomarkers for risk prediction
and drug targets. Agnostic approaches such as genome wide
genetic analyses have identified new biological pathways
and molecules mediating microglial inflammation (TREM2)
and endocytosis (BIN1, PICALM) as having a previously un-
suspected key role in AD pathophysiology [2,3].
Blood metabolomics is an attractive tool for agnostic explo-
ration of disease pathways for several reasons. Metabolites are
small molecules that reflect the interplay of genetic and envi-
ronmental factors, readily cross the blood-brain barrier and
their levels are modifiable through dietary or pharmacological
interventions. This recognition has spurred interest in using
metabolomics as a tool to understand AD. For example, longi-
tudinal studies in mouse models of AD have implicated per-
turbed polyamine metabolism, disturbances in essential
amino acids, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and in
the neurotransmitter serotonin along with imbalances in phos-
pholipid and acylcarnitine homeostasis in both the brain and
the blood [4]. Human studies in cerebrospinal fluid and plasma
have to date only compared AD cases to controls in cross-
sectional settings or attempted to identify markers predicting
conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to clinical
dementia [5–9]. However, in persons with MCI or dementia, it
is not possible to determine if the observed metabolite changes
are causal or secondary to disease-related processes. There has
only been one prior study of preclinical AD that failed to
detect any consistently reproducible signal [10].
We conducted a prospective study relating blood metab-
olites, lipid, and lipoprotein lipids quantified by nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectrometry (MS) me-
tabolomics to risk of incident dementia and AD in eight lon-
gitudinal studies with a total of 22,623 participants free of
dementia at baseline: the FINRISK 1997 study, the Dietary,
Lifestyle and Genetic determinants of Obesity and Meta-
bolic Syndrome (DILGOM) study, the Whitehall II Study,
the Estonian biobank study (EGCUT), the Health 2000,
the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), the Rotterdam study
(RS), and the Erasmus Ruchen Family (ERF) study. The first

 four cohorts were used in discovery analyses, and the re-
maining four were used for replication. For metabolites
taken to replication, we present overall association results
combined across all eight samples by meta-analysis.
2. Methods
2.1. Cohorts
Eight prospective cohort studies were examined. Discov-
ery cohorts were The National FINRISK Study 1997 (FIN-
RISK 1997), DILGOM, Whitehall II, and the Estonian
biobank study (EGCUT). Replication cohorts were the RS,
ERF study, Health 2000 study, and the FHS. More detailed de-
scriptions of each study are provided in the Supplementary
Material (Supplements–Methods–Surveys).
Altogether, 22,623 participants were included in this
study. The sample size and baseline characteristics of each
study are presented in Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. All par-
ticipants who at baseline examination had a history of doctor-
diagnosed prevalent dementia, including AD, stroke, or other
neurological disease affecting cognitive function, were
excluded. No cognitive performance screening was conduct-
ed at baseline. Patients under 40 years of age were also
excluded from all studies except ERF. All metabolite mea-
surements were made from stored samples drawn at baseline
of each cohort and no time-dependent covariates were used.
Dementia identification in FINRISK 1997, DILGOM,
and Health 2000 cohorts was performed in the same manner,
using country-wide, electronic health care registers: Causes
of death Register, Hospital Discharge Register, and National
Social Insurance Institution’s Drug Reimbursement Regis-
ter. In the EGCUT study cohort, participants were linked
to the Estonian Health Insurance database containing
detailed information on all contacts with health care services
and prescriptions, and Estonian Causes of Death Registry,
whereas prevalent disease information was additionally
retrieved from recruitment questionnaires. In the Whitehall
II study, participants were linked to electronic health records
for dementia ascertainment using three databases: the na-
tional hospital episode statistics database, the Mental Health
Services Data Set, and the mortality register. In the ERF sur-
vey, we used register data from general practitioner’s data-
bases (9 to 14 years after baseline visit). RS participants
were screened for dementia at baseline and at follow-up ex-
aminations using a three-step protocol. Screen-positive
participants subsequently underwent a more detailed exam-
ination and informant interview with the Cambridge Exam-
ination for Mental Disorders in the Elderly [11]. In addition,
the total cohort was continuously monitored for dementia
through computerized linkage of the study database with
digitized medical records from general practitioners [11].
In the FHS, we screened participants at each examination,
and between visits, for possible cognitive decline through
a number of mechanisms, including an administration of
the Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination [12], partici-
pant and physician referrals, annual health status updates
and review of medical records, and persons “flagged” as hav-
ing possible cognitive decline underwent a more detailed
neuropsychological and neurological evaluation. All cases
were reviewed by a panel comprising at least one behavioral
neurologist and one neuropsychologist. Details of end point
detection are presented in the Supplementary Material
(Supplements–Methods–Surveys). The cohort-specific de-
mentia and AD detection methods are described in
Supplementary Table 3.
2.2. Metabolomics analyses
Aserum NMRmetabolomicsplatform(Nightingale Health
Ltd, Helsinki, Finland) was used to quantify 228 circulating
metabolites, lipid or lipoprotein lipid measures in seven of
the eight cohorts [13]. All tested metabolites are listed in
Supplementary Table 4. This high-throughput metabolomics
platform provides simultaneous quantification of routine
lipids, lipid concentrations of 14 lipoprotein subclasses, and
major subfractions, and further abundant fatty acids, amino
acids, ketone bodies, and gluconeogenesis-related metabolites
in absolute concentration units. The measured variables
include 148 primary measures quantified in absolute concen-
trations as well as selected ratios, primarily related to fatty
acids and lipoprotein composition. The NMR platform has
been applied extensively in epidemiological studies [14,15],
and details of the experimentation have been described
elsewhere [13,16]. NMR analysis was used in all cohorts
except FHS. In the FHS cohort, liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been used. LC-
MS data were acquired using either an AB SCIEX 4000
QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (positively
charged polar compounds and lipids) or an AB SCIEX
5500 QTRAP triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (nega-
tively charged polar compounds). Detailed protocols for
the quantification of metabolites in the FHS have been previ-
ously published [17,18] and are described in Supplementary
Material (Supplement–Methods–Metabolite analysis). A
subset of 2638 serum samples from the FINRISK 1997 study
were additionally profiled with LC-MS using the Absolu-
teIDQ p180 Kit assay from Biocrates (Innsbruck, Austria).
The correlations between circulating BCAA determined by
NMR and LC-MS among the same individuals were fairly
good as shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. The value of r2
was 0.61 and 0.45 for valine and leucine, respectively.
2.3. Statistical analysis
In the discovery stage, we analyzed the associations of all
metabolites, lipid, and lipoprotein lipid measures quantified
by NMR metabolomics (n 5 228) with incident dementia
and AD. Two models were used: model 1 with age, sex, edu-
cation grade, and number of apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 al-
leles as covariates and model 2 which additionally adjusted
for systolic blood pressure, hypertension treatment, prevalent

s & Dementia 14 (2018) 723-733
725
 diabetes, current smoking, and any prevalent cardiovascular
disease (atrial fibrillation,coronaryheartdisease,heartfailure,
stroke, or peripheral artery disease). Because some of the
NMR metabolites are highly correlated, we performed a prin-
cipal component analysis to estimate the number of indepen-
dent tests and corrected the P-values for multiple testing
accordingly. The principal component analysis was conducted
in the FINRISK 1997 cohort and 95% of the variation of NMR
metabolites, lipids, and lipoprotein lipids was explained by 25
principal components, giving the corresponding P-value of
.002 (0.05/25) as statistically significant (type I error correc-
tion). We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to
test the metabolite associations. Time from the baseline exam-
ination to incident dementia, AD, death, or the end of the
follow-up was used as the timescale, and age was used as a co-
variate in all models. Hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% con-
fidence intervals are presented per 1-SD of the rank inverse
normal transformed concentration; 1-SD change in units is
presented in Supplementary Table 4. Proportional hazard
assumption was tested in two discovery cohorts (FINRISK
1997, DILGOM), and violations were observed for 14 metabo-
lites (marked with asterisk in Supplementary Table 6). None of
thesemetabolitesorlipoproteinlipidsweresignificantinthedis-
covery analysis. All metabolites with P-value less than .002 in
discovery meta-analyses were taken forward for testing in
the replication cohorts. Because FHS did not use the NMR
metabolomics platform, there were only a limited number
of metabolites that could be replicated in the FHS cohort:
valine, leucine, isoleucine, and creatinine. To examine the
possible effect of selective mortality on our findings, we
also conducted a sensitivity analysis using Fine-Gray subdis-
tribution hazard modeling for the 10 discovered metabolites
[19]. Death from any other cause than dementia was used as a
competing risk in these models. The statistical analyses were
carried out with R, version 3.2.3 or 3.3.1 using “survival,”
“cmprsk,” and “meta” packages [20–22].
3. Results
The study included 22,623 subjects with 246,698 person-
years of follow-up. In discovery cohorts, we observed alto-
gether 329, 181, and 1435 cases of incident dementia, AD,
and deaths from any cause, respectively. The EGCUT cohort
did not record AD cases separately. The median follow-up
times were 10.0, 7.9, 17.9, and 7.5 years (0.0, 0.1, 0.7, and
1.2 interquartile range) in FINRISK 1997, DILGOM, White-
hall II, and EGCUT cohorts, respectively (Supplementary
Table 1).
In replication cohorts, we observed altogether 666, 466,
and 1405 cases of incident dementia, AD, and deaths from
any cause, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). The base-
line
characteristics
for
all
cohorts
are
presented
in
Supplementary Tables 1 and 2. The classical risk factors
for dementia, used as covariates in our models, produced
the expected results (Supplementary Table 5). Covariates
are described in Supplementary Material (Supplement–
Methods–Covariates). As a positive control, it is worth noting
that the number of APOE ε4 alleles was strongly associated
with the risk of incident dementia (HR 5 2.51, 95% confi-
dence interval 2.00–3.16, P ,.001, Supplementary Table 5)
3.1. Discovery and replication findings
In the discovery analyses (n 5 15,161/329 study subjects/
cases of incident dementia), altogether 10 metabolites or lipo-
protein lipids were associated with incident dementia
(P ,.002) (Table 1) and nonewith incident AD. All the results
of discovery analyses are presented in the Supplementary

 Tables 6–9, for both models and both outcomes, dementia, and
AD. The 10 metabolites and lipoprotein lipids were tested
further in four replication cohorts (Health 2000, RS, ERF,
and FHS), and these results are shown in Table 2 (dementia,
model 2) and Supplementary Tables 10–12 (dementia model
1 and AD models 1–2). None of the statistically significant
metabolite associations were driven by a single cohort and
the results appeared to be consistent in all discovery and repli-
cation cohorts (Supplementary Figs. 2–3).
3.2. Meta-analysis of all cohorts
The results of the discovery and replication cohorts were
combined in meta-analysis of all cohorts (n 5 22,623/995
study subjects/cases of incident dementia). All three BCAAs
(isoleucine, leucine, and valine) were inversely associated
with incident dementia (model 2), (Fig. 1, Supplementary
Tables 13 and 14). Also creatinine, total cholesterol in small
VLDL (S-VLDL-C), and triglycerides to total lipids ratio in
very large VLDL were inversely associated with incident de-
mentia (Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 13 and 14). The concen-
tration of cholesterol esters relative to total lipids in large HDL
(L-HDL-CE-%) and total cholesterol to total lipids ratio in
very large VLDL were directly associated with incident de-
mentia (Fig. 1) (Supplementary Tables 13 and 14). The HRs
for AD were broadly similar but smaller numbers of incident
AD cases compared to incident dementia diluted the statistical
significance of the results (Fig. 1, Supplementary Tables 15
and 16). The correlations between the metabolites associated
with incident dementia are presented in Supplementary
Table 17. Of note are the moderately strong correlations be-
tween the BCAAs and S-VLDL-C (r 5 0.67–0.55).
3.3. Sensitivity analyses
We carried out two sensitivity analyses. First, to examine
the influence of body mass index (BMI) and cholesterol-
lowering medication on incident dementia and AD risk. Sec-
ond, to examine the possible effects of selective mortality,
we conducted Fine-Gray subdistribution hazard analysis
for the 10 discovered metabolites. These analyses are briefly
described in the next two paragraphs.
The associations of BCAAs, L-HDL-CE-%, and S-VLDL-
C with incident dementia remained similar after adjusting for
BMI and cholesterol-lowering medication (Supplementary
Table 18). However none of the discovered metabolites
were associated with incident AD after the analyses were
adjusted for BMI and cholesterol-lowering medication
(Supplementary Tables 18 and 19).
Next, we hypothesized that the associations of metabo-
lites with incident dementia or AD might be confounded
by a competing risk of death because the elevated levels
of, for example, BCAA have been associated with metabolic
syndrome, diabetes, and cardiovascular events. In Fine-Gray
subdistribution hazard analysis, creatinine and BCAAs
remained significantly associated with lower, and L-HDL-
CE-%
with
higher,
dementia
risk
(Supplementary
Table 20). S-VLVD-C was not associated with incident de-
mentia in Fine-Gray analysis (Supplementary Table 20).
Other HDL- or VLDL lipoprotein subclasses were not asso-
ciated with dementia risk in Fine-Gray analysis. We did not
observe any statistically significant associations between
metabolites and incident AD in Fine-Gray analysis. This is
not surprising because all Fine-Gray results were adjusted
for model 2 and BMI.
Ina meta-analysisofFINRISK 1997,DILGOM,andHealth
2000 results, we observed nointeractionsbetween metabolites,
lipids, or lipoprotein lipids, and APOE ε4 genotype or sex on
the association (P ,.002) with incident dementia or AD.
4. Discussion
Our study identified 10 metabolites or lipoprotein lipids
associated with the risk for clinically incident dementia

 across four discovery cohorts. Lower levels of the BCAA
such as valine were associated with an increased risk of
both all dementia and of AD in this discovery cohort and
in a combined meta-analysis with a replication sample. In
addition, we observed inverse associations of creatinine, to-
tal cholesterol in S-VLDL-C, and triglycerides to total lipids
ratio in very large VLDL with incident dementia, but not
with AD in the discovery cohort alone. In meta-analysis,
the concentration of L-HDL-CE-% was associated with an
increased risk of AD.
We tested 228 metabolic measures quantified by serum
NMR metabolomics in the discovery sample. We chose a
conservative strategy of initial discovery followed by inde-
pendent replication of a hard clinical end point, to minimize

 the risk of reporting false-positive associations, a pitfall that
has impacted earlier reports. This may have however reduced
our ability to identify some true associations, for example,
with docosahexaenoic acid which, in addition to earlier liter-
ature [23,24], was recently discovered to associate with higher
general cognitive ability in a study based partly on the same
cohorts as the present study (Sven J. van der Lee, personal
communication, article submitted).
To our knowledge, the inverse association of BCAAs with
clinical dementia has not been reported previously. In line
with our results, Toledo et al. observed higher valine level
to be associated with slower cognitive decline and lesser ce-
rebral atrophy change in the “Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroi-
maging Initiative” cohort [25].
Although there are biologically plausible explanations for
such an association for what we describe, subsequently we
wished to explore whether these findings could represent
reverse causality or selective survival. Valine, leucine, and
isoleucine are essential BCAAs, and circulating levels are
largely determined by dietary intake. Thus, reduced levels
of these essential amino acids might indicate subclinical
nutritional deficiencies in persons with preclinical dementia
and MCI [26]. Indeed, in later life, weight loss is known to be
associated with a higher risk of dementia, and it has been
associated with declining BCAA levels [27,28]. However,
plasma albumin, which is used as a marker of nutrition,
was not related to dementia risk and BCAA’s HRs for
incident dementia remained similar after adjusting for
BMI. BCAAs are also associated with muscle mass [29],
which is consistent with our observation of an inverse asso-
ciation of creatinine and dementia risk. Hence, it is possible
that these metabolites are early markers of MCI, reduced
physical activity, and muscle mass.
Competing risk of death in persons with elevated BCAA
levels is not likely to explain the observed inverse associations
with incident dementia because BCAAs remained associated
with incident dementia in Fine-Gray subdistribution model. In
a recent study, Pedersen et al demonstrated that gut micro-
biota are an independent source of BCAAs [30], but these
have not been examined in relation to dementia risk although
changes in gut microbiota have been associated with other
neuropsychiatric diseases [31].
Lower cerebrospinal fluid valine has been recorded in
persons with AD dementia compared to controls [32],
although some studies have shown low valine in MCI
and higher values in AD [33]. In a small cross-sectional
study, no differences were seen in BCAA blood levels
among healthy controls, patients with MCI, and those
with AD [34], but an independent cross-sectional study
identified valine, among other metabolites, as an indica-
tor for disease progression from MCI to AD [33]. It is hy-
pothesized that circulating BCAAs could have an
important role in glutamate synthesis and could also
buffer toxic levels of glutamate [35]. Glutamate is the
most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter and binds to
cell
surface
receptors
like
a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-
methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid
receptors
and
N-
methyl-D-aspartate receptors [36]. Because N-methyl-
D-aspartate-receptor hypofunction seems to be related
to calcium ion dysregulation and impaired synaptic plas-
ticity [37], it is possible that the association of reduced
levels of BCAA to dementia and AD is mediated through
this pathway [33]. Higher valine has also been associated
with increased apoptosis in maple syrup urine disease,
and lower valine in preclinical AD could be a compensa-
tory phenomenon in response to activation of apoptotic
pathways [38]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that
once
the
models
were
adjusted
for
BMI
and
cholesterol-lowering medication, the associations be-
tween BCAAs and incident AD were no longer statisti-
cally
significant.
The
robust
association
of
these
metabolites with all dementia and vanishing association
with AD may reflect the smaller numbers of AD cases or
be due to a stronger association with vascular dementia.
AVLDL-receptor polymorphism has been reported to asso-
ciate with dementia risk, especially with mixed and vascular
dementia [39]. We detected total VLDL cholesterol to be
inversely associated with dementia risk as did Lara et al.
[40] The association between VLDL cholesterol and cardio-
vascular events [14,41] is one possible explanation for our
observation. In addition, we observed one VLDL lipoprotein
subclass to decrease (triglycerides to total lipids ratio in very
large VLDL) and one to increase (total cholesterol to total
lipids ratio in very large VLDL) the dementia risk. To the
best of our knowledge, no association between large HDL
lipoprotein
and
dementia
risk
has
been
published
previously. Cholesterol-lowering medication affects lipopro-
tein levels, and these associations, except L-HDL-CE-%
and S-VLDL-C, with incident dementia were attenuated after
adjusting for BMI and cholesterol-lowering medication. As-
sociation of S-VLDL-C with incident dementia can be largely
explained by increased selective mortality. We believe that the
associations between HDL lipoprotein and VLDL lipoprotein
subclasses and dementia risk need more research because our
findings and the previous studies are inconclusive.
We did not observe any robust associations of choles-
terols, triglycerides, phospholipids, apolipoproteins, fatty
acids, glycolysis-related metabolites, ketone bodies, fluid
balance metabolites, or inflammation markers with incident
dementia or AD. In previous studies, several specific phos-
pholipids have been shown to associate with the risk of con-
version of MCI to AD [6,9], but the metabolomics platform
used here does not share the same phospholipids reported on
in those earlier studies.
Our results also differ from prior studies which suggested
an association of sphingomyelin and docosahexaenoic acid
with dementia and AD [6,23,24,42]; these differences could
be due to chance or differences in dietary patterns or
genetic risk between the cohorts studied here and in early
reports. Docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid
dietary supplements have been associated with better
cognitive function [43,44], and lower odds of dementia and

 AD (personal communication, Sven J. van der Lee) in some
studies but two large meta-analyses did not show an associa-
tion, suggesting that this area deserves further scrutiny
including possible gene-environment interactions [45]. Our
conservative statistical strategy and lower sensitivity to detect
some associations may partly explain these differences be-
tween our study and previous studies as described above.
We did not observe any effect modification of the metabo-
lites or lipoprotein lipids by APOE genotype or sex in their ef-
fect on dementia or AD risk. We did not observe any robust
associations with absolute concentrations of lipoproteins and
incident dementia or AD. This is in line with previous genetic
studies where no causal effect of circulating levels of HDL
cholesterol, serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, or tri-
glycerides on incident AD was seen, despite the genetic asso-
ciations with the APOE and ABCA7 loci [46,47]. Age,
education level, APOE genotype, and prevalent diabetes
were the only covariates associated with incident dementia
in this study. We did not observe statistically significant
association between incident dementia and smoking, systolic
blood pressure, heart failure, or atrial fibrillation. This is not
surprising because the analyses were not designed to
investigate these associations, and survival bias likely affects
these results.
The strengths of our study include the large samples and
prospective population-based design with separate discovery
and replication cohorts. Furthermore, all NMR metabolomics
measurements were carried out in the same laboratory
following the same protocol, and only one cohort used a
different methodology. Limitations of the study include
some differences between cohorts in the methods used to
identify cases of incident dementia. Most cohorts relied on
electronic health registers, which leads to virtually complete
follow-up and high specificity but may have limited sensi-
tivity [48]. The lower sensitivity potentially reduces the power
to detect statistically significant associations but should not
result in spurious associations. Moreover, the findings were
replicated in prospective cohorts such as the RS and FHS
that used more sensitive, surveillance-based outcome ascer-
tainment. Some cohorts were unable to distinguish AD from
other dementias, which led to a reduced statistical power for
the AD analysis. Ethnic homogeneity of our largely Cauca-
sian sample limits the generalizability of these results to other
populations with different ethnic backgrounds. Also, the FHS
used an MS platform, and therefore, only a limited set of me-
tabolites were in common between the FHS and other cohorts.
The main association we report here, of BCAA, was however
directionally consistent in FHS and the other cohorts and the
correlations between the BCAAs measured using MS and
NMR were reasonably strong.
Several next steps can be considered to clarify our find-
ings further. The earlier studies that have reported an associ-
ation between BCAA and metabolic syndrome and diabetes
risk, should be examined for availability of cognitive end
points and possible confirmation of the present findings.
Furthermore, a Mendelian randomization study on BCAA
and other metabolites and incident dementia or AD should
help with causal inferences. A Mendelian randomization
study on BCAAs and risk of type 2 diabetes has been pub-
lished suggesting that suitable single-nucleotide polymor-
phisms exist [49], although this work has been recently
criticized for the possibility of misinterpretation due to plei-
otropism [50]. If further evidence supporting causality is ob-
tained, a clinical trial supplementing BCAA in diet could be
considered but such a trial should be carefully designed and
monitored also for diabetes and other metabolic outcomes. A
wider angle is the rapidly increasing availability of metabo-
lomics profiling. Researchers should consider establishing
an international metabolomics consortium aiming at harmo-
nizing measures and analysis protocols across metabolomics
platforms and cohorts, so that data already collected can be
meta-analyzed. This would also encourage metabolomics
studies in other geographical areas and other ethnic groups,
which are clearly needed. Another line of research that is
worth pursuing in parallel to confirming the discovery find-
ings is the prediction of dementia or AD risk. Even if not
causal, these biomarkers may improve the prediction of inci-
dent dementia or AD over and above the currently used risk
scores. This in turn could enable earlier starting and better
targeting of medical and other treatments, which has the po-
tential to slow down the cognitive decline.
In conclusion, our large prospective study identified lower
BCAA levels to be associated with an increased risk of inci-
dent dementia, independent of other conventional risk fac-
tors. Moreover, creatinine, one HDL, and three VLDL
lipoprotein subclasses were also associated with dementia
risk, but these associations disappeared when adjusted for
BMI and cholesterol-lowering medication. Further studies
are needed to explore whether these metabolites play a role
in the etiology and pathogenesis of dementia, or reflect
reverse causation, that is, they are biomarkers for systemic
or lifestyle changes in the preclinical stages of dementia. In
either case, if corroborated in other studies, these biomarkers
may help in early identification of persons at risk of dementia
and initiation of preventive and treatment measures.

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT
1. Systematic review: Blood metabolites are small mol-
ecules that reflect the interplay between genetic and
environmental factors, readily cross the blood-brain
barrier, and have the potential to play a role in the
development of dementia. Well-powered prospective
studies on metabolome and incident dementia or
Alzheimer’s disease are limited at the moment.
2. Interpretation: We carried out a large prospective
study on metabolite, lipid, and lipoprotein lipid asso-
ciations with incident dementia and Alzheimer’s dis-
ease in eight cohorts. Branched-chain amino acids
isoleucine, leucine, and valine and cholesterol ester
ratio in large HDL had robust associations with the
risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Selective
mortality did not explain these associations.
3. Future directions: Future mechanistic studies should
examine whether the identified metabolites or lipo-
protein lipids play etiologic roles in the development
of dementia or whether they are early biomarkers of
mild cognitive decline and developing physical
frailty.
