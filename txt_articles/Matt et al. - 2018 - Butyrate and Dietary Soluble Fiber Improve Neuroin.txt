Aging results in chronic systemic inflammation that can alter neuroinflammation of the 
brain. Specifically, microglia shift to a pro-inflammatory phenotype predisposing them to 
hyperactivation upon stimulation by peripheral immune signals. It is proposed that cer-
tain nutrients can delay brain aging by preventing or reversing microglial hyperactivation. 
Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) produced primarily by bacterial fermentation of 
fiber in the colon, has been extensively studied pharmacologically as a histone deacety-
lase inhibitor and serves as an attractive therapeutic candidate, as butyrate has also 
been shown to be anti-inflammatory and improve memory in animal models. In this 
study, we demonstrate that butyrate can attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine expres-
sion in microglia in aged mice. It is still not fully understood, however, if an increase in 
butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut as a consequence of a diet high in soluble fiber 
could affect microglial activation during aging. Adult and aged mice were fed either a 
1% cellulose (low fiber) or 5% inulin (high fiber) diet for 4 weeks. Findings indicate that 
mice fed inulin had an altered gut microbiome and increased butyrate, acetate, and total 
SCFA production. In addition, histological scoring of the distal colon demonstrated that 
aged animals on the low fiber diet had increased inflammatory infiltrate that was signifi-
cantly reduced in animals consuming the high fiber diet. Furthermore, gene expression 
of inflammatory markers, epigenetic regulators, and the microglial sensory apparatus 
(i.e., the sensome) were altered by both diet and age, with aged animals exhibiting a 
more anti-inflammatory microglial profile on the high fiber diet. Taken together, high fiber 
supplementation in aging is a non-invasive strategy to increase butyrate levels, and 
these data suggest that an increase in butyrate through added soluble fiber such as 
inulin could counterbalance the age-related microbiota dysbiosis, potentially leading to 
neurological benefits.

During healthy aging, there is a disruption in the communication and balance between the brain 
and immune system. Microglia shift to a pro-inflammatory phenotype that makes them hyper-
sensitive to signals from the peripheral immune system (1, 2). The precise mechanisms during 
aging that are responsible for this detrimental transition is not known, but overproduction of the

pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β has been shown 
to play a role. In a recent study, we demonstrated that aged mice 
had decreased methylation of the IL-1β gene promoter in pri-
mary microglia basally or following systemic lipopolysaccharide 
(LPS) that is associated with increased IL-1β mRNA (3). This 
is critical because overproduction of IL-1β can cause cognitive 
dysfunction in rodent models (4) and increased IL-1β in aged 
individuals is associated with risk of neurodegenerative diseases 
such as Alzheimer’s (5).
It is proposed that certain nutrients can manipulate the epig-
enome to delay brain aging by preventing or reversing microglial 
aging, potentially through DNA methylation, histone modifica-
tions, and their interactions (6). Butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid 
(SCFA) produced by bacterial fermentation of fiber in the colon, 
has been extensively studied for its beneficial effects through 
free fatty acid receptor signaling and metabolic regulation, but 
also pharmacologically as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibi-
tor. HDAC inhibitors have become an attractive therapeutic 
candidate due to the ability to increase histone acetylation and 
promote the expression of neurotrophic and anti-inflammatory 
genes (7, 8). Although most studies using butyrate have focused 
on its effects on histone acetylation, there is also evidence that 
butyrate can affect DNA methylation (9–11).
Sodium butyrate (NaB), the sodium salt form of butyrate, is 
most commonly used in pharmacological studies and has been 
shown to decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines of microglia 
in vitro as well as improve learning and memory in mouse models 
of neurodegenerative diseases when injected intraperitoneally 
(i.p.) (12, 13). It has also recently been demonstrated that NaB 
triggers elongation of microglial processes and can abolish LPS-
induced depressive-like behaviors through decreasing microglial 
activation (14, 15).
To date, only a handful of studies have probed the mechanistic 
basis surrounding the beneficial neurological effects of a high 
fermentable fiber diet, which has the capacity to shift SCFA 
production to favor butyrate (16). Notably, one study found 
significant immune benefits in the brain of mice fed a high 
fermentable (soluble) fiber diet and found that they recovered 
faster from LPS-induced sickness (17). After exposure to LPS, 
mice fed the soluble fiber diet showed an increase in the IL-1 
antagonist, IL-1RA, and a decrease in IL-1β and TNF-α in the 
brain. Brain IL-4 mRNA was also increased, and as IL-4 expres-
sion is enhanced by increased histone acetylation, the authors 
hypothesized that the elevated butyrate from the dietary fiber 
fermentation may contribute to the immune response. It is 
still not fully understood, however, if an increase in butyrate-
producing bacteria in the gut as a consequence of soluble fiber 
diet, could affect microglial activation, and specifically microglial 
activation in aging.
Short-chain fatty acid concentrations are likely less than 
optimal in older adults, as data indicate daily dietary fiber intake 
for both older men and women is roughly 40% below the recom-
mended adequate intake (18). There is also a lower capacity to 
produce butyrate in the elderly gut microbiome, as suggested by 
fewer copies of the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase gene 
compared with younger adults and lower amounts of bacterial 
groups which are known butyrate producers (19, 20). Therefore, 
the aging population is an important demographic for where 
increased fiber supplementation is needed. Of note, inulin is a 
soluble dietary fiber that increases butyrate-producing bacteria 
(21). Inulin belongs to a group of non-digestible carbohydrates 
called fructans and is considered a prebiotic (22). Studies have 
specifically demonstrated that inulin is beneficial for age-related 
inflammation, as a nutritional supplement with inulin increased 
innate immunity and protection against infections in elderly 
 
people (23). Thus, an increase in butyrate through added soluble 
fiber such as inulin could counterbalance the age-related micro-
biota dysbiosis, and potentially lead to neurological benefits.
We first determined if direct administration of NaB had 
beneficial effects on microglia in aged mice with and without an 
immune challenge. Building on these findings, we investigated 
whether soluble fiber (inulin) administered to aged mice would 
promote changes in the microbiome that reduced peripheral 
inflammation concurrent to decreased neuroinflammation. We 
hypothesized that NaB administration and a high soluble fiber 
diet could diminish or even reverse the aged neuroinflammatory 
phenotype in mice following an immune challenge.

experiment 1: effects of intraperitoneal 
administration of sodium Butyrate in 
adult and aged Mice on the Microglial  
and hippocampal response to lPs
Animals
Adult (3- to 6-month olds) and aged (22- to 25-month olds) Balb/c 
 
male mice were reared in-house and provided with ad libitum 
access to chow (Teklad 8640, Harlan Laboratories, Indianapolis, 
IN, USA) and water. Mice were individually housed in a temper-
ature-controlled environment with a 12-h reversed-phase light/
dark cycle (lights on 21:00 h).
Treatment groups comprised the 2 × 2 factorial arrangement 
of LPS and NaB and were initiated at the onset of the dark cycle. 
Both Escherichia coli LPS (serotype 0127:B8, Sigma, St. Louis, 
MO, USA) and NaB (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) were dissolved 
in sterile saline before experimentation. Mice from both age 
groups were injected i.p. with either saline (control) or NaB at 
1.2 g/kg body weight and 2 h later with saline or LPS at 0.33 mg/kg 
 
body weight. This dose of NaB was selected based on previous 
studies demonstrating significant beneficial effects in other 
rodent models (12, 24, 25). This dose of LPS was selected based 
on previous studies demonstrating that 0.33 mg/kg LPS produced 
prolonged sickness behavior in aged compared with young mice 
(26). Treatments were administered at 9 a.m. for all cohorts. Body 
weight was measured at baseline and 4 h after injections as an 
index of sickness response. All studies were carried out in accord-
ance with United States National Institutes of Health guidelines 
and approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee.

hippocampus which was frozen in dry ice) was collected and used 
immediately for microglia isolation using a procedure adapted 
from Nikademova and Watters (27). Brains were enzymatically 
digested using the Neural Tissue Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi 
Biotec, Germany) for 35 min at 37°C. Further processing was 
performed at 4°C. Tissue debris was removed by passing the cell 
suspension through a 40-µm cell strainer. After myelin removal 
using 30% Percoll Plus (GE Healthcare, Princeton, NJ, USA), 
cells in PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA were 
incubated for 15 min with anti-Cd11b magnetic beads (Miltenyi 
Biotec, Germany). CD11b+ cells were extensively washed and 
separated in a magnetic field using MS columns (Miltenyi 
Biotec, Germany) before being directly placed in Trizol reagent 
(Invitrogen).
RNA Isolation and Real-Time RT-PCR
Total RNA from microglia and hippocampus was isolated using 
the Tri Reagent protocol (Invitrogen). Synthesis of cDNA was 
carried out using a high-capacity RT kit (Applied Biosystems, 
Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Real-time RT-PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 
7900HT-sequence detection system (Perkin Elmer, Forest City, 
CA, USA). All genes were analyzed using PrimeTime real-time 
RT-PCR Assays (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, 
USA) and were compared with the housekeeping control gene 
GAPDH (Mm99999915_g1) using the 2−∆∆Ct calculation method 
as previously described (28). Recent papers have established that 
 
in response to LPS, GAPDH has stable expression levels compared 
to other housekeeping genes (29). Based on this and on numerous 
other papers that have reliably used GAPDH (30–32), we chose 
to use GAPDH as our housekeeping gene. Data are expressed as 
fold change versus saline control adult mice.
Fluidigm
Total RNA from microglia was isolated using the Tri Reagent 
protocol (Invitrogen) and synthesis of cDNA was carried out 
using a high-capacity RT kit (Applied Biosystems) as previ-
ously described for real-time RT-PCR. Fluidigm reactions were 
performed by the UIUC Functional Genomics Unit of the W.M. 
Keck Center using a 96 × 96 chip and included two technical 
replicates for each combination of sample and assay. Data were 
acquired using the Fluidigm Real-Time PCR Analysis software 
3.0.2 (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA, USA). Data from Fluidigm 
runs were manually checked for reaction quality before analysis, 
and Ct values for each gene target (see Table 1) were normalized 
to Ct values for the housekeeping gene Gapdh.

soluble Fiber Diets on central and 
Peripheral inflammation in adult and  
aged Mice
Animals and Diet
Adult (3- to 6-month olds) and aged (22- to 25-month olds) male 
Balb/c mice were housed as described in Experiment 1, but were 
fed either AIN-93M diet with 5% cellulose (product # D10012M, 
Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) or one of two 
AIN-93M modified diets that contained either 1% cellulose 
(product # D16060605, Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, 
NJ, USA) or 1% cellulose and 5% inulin (product # D16060606, 
Research Diets, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA) for 4 weeks. 
Composition of these diets can be seen in Table 2, modified from 
Research Diets, Inc. Fecal samples were taken from adult and 
aged mice (on chow) prior to the start of the study to assess the 
microbiome at baseline. Mice from both age groups were injected

i.p. with either saline (control) or LPS at 0.33 mg/kg body weight. 
Treatments were administered at 9 a.m. for all cohorts. Body 
weight was measured at baseline and 4 h after injections as an 
index of sickness response. All studies were carried out in accord-
ance with United States National Institutes of Health guidelines 
and approved by the University of Illinois Institutional Animal 
Care and Use Committee.
Tissue Collection and Microglia Isolation
Four hours after LPS injections, animals were euthanized via 
CO2 asphyxiation, blood was taken, and animals were perfused 
with sterile ice-cold saline. Samples were collected from colon, 
liver, mesenteric lymph nodes, and hippocampus and were 
frozen on dry ice. Cecal content and feces were also taken for 
analysis of SFCA concentrations and microbiota composi-
tions, respectively. Distal colon was taken for histological 
analysis. Brain tissue (all but the hippocampus) was collected 
and used immediately for microglia isolation as described in 
Experiment 1.
Bacterial DNA Isolation and 16S rRNA Sequencing
Fecal bacterial DNA was extracted using the PowerLyzer Power-
Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MOBIO Laboratories, Inc.) and quality 
was assessed via gel electrophoresis. The DNA library was con-
structed using a Fluidigm Access Array system in the Functional 
Genomics Unit of the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the 
University of Illinois at Urbana (UIUC). After library construc-
tion, a 250-bp region of the 16S rRNA gene (V4) were amplified 
using a PCR amplification method modified from Muturi et al. 
(33). Briefly, DNA samples were diluted to 2 ng/µL and amplified 
with Roche High Fidelity Fast Start Kit and 20× Access Array 
loading reagent prior to PCR. Samples were amplified using the 
following Access Array cycling program 50°C for 2 min (1 cycle), 
70°C for 20 min (1 cycle), 95°C for 10 min (1 cycle), followed 
by 10 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min, 
2 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 80°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C 
for 1 min, 8 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72° for 
1 min, 2 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 80°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 
72°C for 1 min, 8 cycles at 95°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C 
for 1 min, and 5 cycles at 95°C for 15 s. After PCR, all samples 
were run on a Fragment Analyzer (Advanced Analytics, Ames, 
IA, USA). Samples were then pooled in equal amounts accord-
ing to PCR product concentration. The pooled products were 
then size selected on a 2% agarose E-gel (Life Technologies) and 
extracted from the isolated gel slice with Qiagen gel extraction kit 
(Qiagen). Cleaned size selected products were run on an Agilent 
Bioanalyzer to confirm appropriate profile and determination 
of average size. The final library pool was spiked with 10% non-
indexed PhiX control library (Illumina®) and sequenced using 
Illumina® MiSeq® V3 Bulk system. The libraries were sequenced 
from both ends of the molecules to a total read length of 
 
250 nt from each end. High-quality (>25) sequence data (FASTQ) 
from the forward read were analyzed with QIIME 2.0 (34). Quality 
control consisted of depleting or removing barcodes, primers, 
and short sequences (<187 bp), sequences with ambiguous base 
calls, and sequences with homopolymer runs exceeding 6 bp. 
After removal of singletons, OTUs were classified using closed 
reference picking against Greengenes database at 97% similarity. 
β-diversity (weighted and unweighted UniFrac distances) were 
computed at an even sampling depth of 10,048 sequences per 
sample based on α-diversity (Chao1) rarefaction plots (Figure S1 
in Supplementary Material).
SCFA Analysis
Short-chain fatty acids were analyzed by dry matter content as 
described previously by Panasevich et al. (35), courtesy of the 
Metabolomics Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign. To calculate dry matter percentage, a portion 
(~0.08–0.15 g) of wet cecal contents were weighed and then heated 
in oven for 24 h to dry samples. Resulting dry matter percentage 
was calculated as [weight of dry sample/weight (g) of wet sample 
(g) × 100]. The rest of the cecal contents (~0.05–0.15 g) were 
acidified immediately after collection in 6.25% meta-phosphoric 
acid solution and stored at −20°C until analysis. SCFA concen-
trations (wet) were determined by gas chromatography by using 
a gas chromatograph (Hewlett-Packard 5890A Series II) and a 
glass column (180 cm × 4 mm i.d.), packed with 10% SP-1200/1% 
H3PO4 on 80/100 + mesh Chromosorb WAW (Supelco, Inc.). 
Nitrogen was the carrier gas with a flow rate of 75 mL/min. Oven, 
detector, and injector temperatures were 125°, 175°, and 180°C, 
respectively. Acetic, n-butyric, and propionic acid solutions 
(Sigma-Aldrich) were used as standards.

DNA Isolation and Pyrosequencing
Total DNA from microglia and hippocampus tissue was isolated 
using the Tri Reagent protocol (Invitrogen). DNA methylation 
for 2 5′—C—phosphate—G—3′ (CpG) sites within the proximal 
promoter region of IL-1β was assessed via bisulfite pyrosequenc-
ing on bisulfite modified DNA (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, 
USA). The mouse IL-1β methylation assay (ID ADS3713-RS1) 
was purchased from EpigenDx (Hopkinton, MA, USA) and 
 
has been previously used to assess methylation status in micro-
glia (36). PCRs were run in duplicate and contained 20 ng of 
bisulfite converted DNA as starting template. Product specificity 
was determined by gel electrophoresis. The primer was also 
tested using bisulfite converted DNA from high and low meth-
ylation controls (EpigenDx, Hopkinton, MA, USA). Qiagen’s 
PyroMark Q24 Advanced Pyrosequencer was used to detect 
DNA methylation levels following manufacturer’s protocols 
and default settings (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), similar to a 
previous study (37).
Distal Colon Histology
Distal colon was fixed in Methacarn (60% methanol, 30% 
chloroform, and 10% acetic acid) for 72 h and then placed in 
100% ethanol until tissue embedding. Distal colon tissue was 
paraffin embedded, and 5-µm sections mounted on glass slides 
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for assessment 
of intestinal morphology, courtesy of the Histology Laboratory 
in the College of Veterinary Medicine at University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign. Histology was scored by a trained, blinded 
observer on a modified version of a published scoring (38) system 
that considers four criteria: inflammatory cell infiltration (0–4), 
goblet cell mucus depletion (0–4), destruction of architecture 
(0–4), and crypt abscesses (0–4). Overall histology score was 
quantified using an aggregate of these scores.
LPS Binding Protein (LBP) Assay
LPS binding protein was quantified in serum samples using the 
Mouse LBP enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Kit (catalog #: 
HK205-02, Hycult Biotech Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA). 
The assay was run according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Statistical Analyses
Body weight, gene expression (including Fluidigm), SCFA analy-
sis, pyrosequencing, colon histology scoring, and LBP data were 
analyzed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS, Cary, NC, USA) 
and were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
Where ANOVA revealed a significant interaction (p < 0.05), 
Fisher’s LSD test was used for post hoc comparisons. Microbiome 
community compositions (β-diversity; weighted Unifrac) were 
compared across ages and diets with permutational analysis of 
variance analysis (PERMANOVA). Next, to unbiasedly identify 
key features of the gut microbiota that are affected by age and 
fiber diets, Random Forest (RF) alongside Boruta feature selec-
tion was performed. Boruta selection uses RF to iteratively 
compare importance of independent variables with that of pseudo- 
random (shadow) attributes (39). Variables “confirmed” by Boruta 
feature selection had significantly higher RF importance scores 
than “shadow” attributes and could therefore delineate between 
diet and age. Analysis was performed on R RF package with 
1,000 trees and all other default values. All data are expressed 
 
as mean ± SEM.

sodium Butyrate Downregulates il-1β 
gene expression in response to lPs  
in adult and aged Microglia and 
hippocampus
To test the effects of NaB on LPS-induced neuroinflammation, 
adult and aged mice were either pretreated i.p. with saline (SAL) 
or NaB, and then given an i.p. injection of either SAL or LPS 2 h 
later. For body weight, LPS-treated adult and aged mice lost more 
weight than saline-treated controls as expected (main effect of 
LPS, p = 0.0052 and p < 0.0001), but there was also an interac-
tion (NaB × LPS, p = 0.0391) with the aged mice in that NaB 
pretreated mice with LPS did not lose as much weight as the SAL 
pretreated mice with LPS (data not shown).
Fluidigm gene expression analysis on microglia was per-
formed to gain a more comprehensive assessment of micro-
glial gene regulation in response to NaB (Tables S1 and S2 in 
Supplementary Material). However, there were very few changes 
associated with NaB in the majority of genes analyzed, so we 
chose to focus on pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression 
(Figures 1A–C). In adult microglia, immune activation by LPS 
increased Il-1β, and butyrate attenuated Il-1β expression [main 
effects of LPS (p = 0.0005), NaB (p = 0.0447), and a trending 
interaction (p = 0.0774)]. An interesting finding was that for 
aged microglia, there were more pronounced changes in Il-1β 
in that NaB decreased LPS-induced Il-1β expression [main 
effects of LPS (p < 0.0001), NaB (p = 0.0497), and an interaction 
(p = 0.0178)]. LPS increased microglial Tnf in both adult and 
aged mice (main effects of LPS, p = 0.02 and p = 0.003), and LPS 
increased microglial Il-6 in only aged mice (main effect of LPS, 
p < 0.0001).
Similar changes were also observed in the hippocampus 
(Figures 1D–F), a brain region that is particularly sensitive to 
the effects of neuroinflammation (40). In the adult hippocam-
pus, LPS increased Il-1β (main effect of LPS, p = 0.0018). But 
in the aged hippocampus, LPS increased Il-1β and NaB attenu-
ated LPS-induced Il-1 [main effects of LPS (p < 0.0001), NaB 
(p = 0.0246), and an interaction (p = 0.0257)]. For hippocampal 
Tnf and Il-6, LPS increased their expression in both adult and

aged mice (main effects of LPS, p = 0.0031 and p < 0.0001, and 
p = 0.0475 and p = 0.0069), although in aged mice there were 
trends for a NaB main effect and interaction for Tnf (p = 0.0804 
and p = 0.0651).
significant shifts in the Microbiome 
associated With age
Microbiome analysis was performed to identify differences 
between adult and aged mice at baseline. β-diversity analysis 
revealed that gut microbiota composition was different between 
adult (3–6 months) and aged (22–25 months) mice fed a normal 
chow diet (PERMANOVA p < 0.05). RF analysis with Boruta 
feature selection identified lower levels of Mucuspirillum spp. 
and Odoribacter spp., and higher levels of in Ruminococcus spp., 
Coprococcus spp., and Rikenellaceae in aged versus adult mice.
high soluble Fiber Diet alters Microbiota 
and increases Production of scFas
Adult and aged mice were fed either a low fiber (1% cellulose) 
or high fiber (1% cellulose + 5% inulin) diet for 4 weeks, and

microbiome analysis from fecal samples was performed to 
identify changes from baseline and confirm previous effects of 
high fiber diet on the microbiome. Mice were injected i.p. with 
SAL or LPS, but we chose to focus on SAL animals, so all results 
presented here are in SAL animals unless otherwise stated. For 
body weight, there were no differences in body weight for age or 
diet (p > 0.05, data not shown).
β-diversity analysis revealed a robust effect of just 4 weeks of sol-
uble fiber feeding on gut microbiota composition (PERMANOVA 
p < 0.05; Figure S2 in Supplementary Material). Of note, inulin 
feeding led to lower abundances of Ruminococcus spp. and f. 
Rikenellaceae, two taxa that were more highly represented in aged 
mice fed a chow diet (Figure 2). Cecal contents were analyzed for 
SCFA concentrations to assess the magnitude and profile of fermen-
tation end products (Figure 3). Inulin feeding led to an increase in 
cecal acetate (p = 0.0066), butyrate (p = 0.009), and total SCFAs 
(p = 0.0107), irrespective of age. Propionate concentrations were 
not responsive to diet nor affected by age (p > 0.05; Figure 3C).
soluble Fiber Diet reduces colonic 
inflammation but Does not rescue signs 
of systemic endotoxemia in aged Mice
Since we observed changes in the microbiome and SCFA analysis 
with adult and aged mice fed different fiber diets, we hypothesized 
that high fiber would reduce signs of inflammation within the

periphery. Representative images of the cecum and colon from 
mice fed low fiber and high fiber diets revealed increased cecal 
size with the high fiber diet, indicative of increased fermenta-
tion (Figure 4A). Distal colon samples were stained with H&E 
to examine morphological changes due to age and fiber diet. 
Representative pictures (Figures 4B,C) indicated severe inflam-
mation associated with immune infiltration in aged animals on 
a low fiber diet. Scoring of histology sections for inflammatory 
infiltrate reveal that there was a main effect of diet (p = 0.0499) 
and an interaction (p = 0.0499) in that aged mice on the high 
fiber diet had decreased inflammatory infiltrate, with scoring not 
significantly different from either low fiber or high fiber adult 
groups (Figure 4D). With regards to total histological scoring, 
there was a trending main effect for diet (p = 0.088) in that diet 
decreased total score (Figure 4E). Lastly, we assessed LBP in 
serum of adult and aged animals fed low and high fiber diets as 
an indirect measure of gut permeability (41). LBP was increased 
by age (p = 0.0298) which matches previous findings from our lab 
(unpublished results), but no significant effect of diet (Figure 4F).
Tight Junctions regulating colonic Barrier 
Function are higher in aged Mice Fed a 
high Fiber Diet
Butyrate and other SCFAs exert their effects through HDAC 
inhibition, but are also used as an energy source and can bind 
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are involved in the 
resolution of inflammation in the gut (42). Therefore, gene 
expression for the pro-inflammatory cytokines Il-1β and Tnf, 
other inflammatory regulators including Il-10 and Il-1rn, 
Il-17, and Il-23, the HDAC Hdac3, tight junction proteins/
intestinal markers Tjp1, Tjp2, Tff3, Ocln, Mct1, and Muc2, as 
well as the FFARs Ffar2 and Gpr109a were measured in colon 
(Figure 5A). There were no significant differences in any of 
the genes analyzed in adult mice (data not shown), so we chose 
to focus on aged animals. Surprisingly, there were no effects 
of diet on pro-inflammatory gene expression, but there was 
an effect of diet for Tjp2 (p = 0.0396) and Ffar2 (p = 0.0319). 
There were also trending effects of diet for Tjp1 (0.0738) and 
Ocln (p = 0.0857). Gene expression for the pro-inflammatory 
cytokines Il-1β, Tnf, and Il-6 were assessed in lymph nodes 
and liver, but there were no differences between low fiber 
and high fiber groups in adult (data no shown) or aged mice 
(Figure 5B). However, numerically there was lower expression 
of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in lymph nodes of aged 
animals on the high fiber diet.
Fiber alters expression of inflammatory, 
sensome, and epigenetic regulator 
genes in adult and aged Microglia
We next wanted to determine whether beneficial changes in the 
periphery through high fiber diet could affect microglial gene 
regulation (Figure 6A). For inflammatory and regulators of 
inflammatory genes, Fluidigm analysis indicated that there were 
a number of significant main effects of diet in that high fiber 
decreased gene expression (Il-1β, Il-1rn, Il-6, Nlrp3, Tlr4, and 
Tnf) (Table 3). For sensome genes, there were main effects of diet

for all genes analyzed (Table 3), as well as an interaction with 
Trem2 in which aged mice on the low fiber diet had the highest 
expression but decreased to levels similar to the adult groups 
with the high fiber diet. For epigenetic regulator genes, there 
were also main effects of almost all genes analyzed, in that high 
fiber decreased expression (Table 3). Of note, some epigenetic 
regulator genes were affected by age similar to what has been 
demonstrated previously (Hdac1 and Gadd45b) (3).
We also wanted to determine if the increased peripheral 
butyrate as a result of a fiber diet is related to central anti-
inflammatory effects. Here, we observed that microglial expres-
sion of Il-1β, Tnf, and Il-6 inversely associated with cecal butyrate 
concentrations (data not shown). However, higher acetate and 
total SCFA concentrations were also inversely associated with 
 
Il-1β, Tnf, and Il-6, and propionate was only significantly cor-
related with Il-1β (data not shown).

Tnf, p = 0.0145, and Il-6, p > 0.05) (Figures 6B–D). Recently, 
it has been found that SCFA can modify not only histone 
modifications, but also DNA methylation. Therefore, we chose 
to assess the effects of fiber diet on DNA methylation patterns 
within the brain. Due to low DNA yield, we were not able to 
assess Il-1β DNA methylation in microglia. However, in the 
hippocampus (Figures 6E,F), analysis of Il-1β DNA methyla-
tion revealed a main effect of age in Il-1β CpG1 (p = 0.0395). 
There were no changes in Il-1β CpG2.

For Experiment 2, a separate cohort of mice was injected i.p. with 
LPS to characterize differences in immune stimulus associated 
with diet. LPS decreased body weight as expected (1–2 g on 
average, data not shown), differences in body weight existed with 
respect to age or diet (p > 0.05, data not shown).

main effects and interactions were seen in the sensome (Cd53, 
Siglech, P2ry12, P2ry13, Trem2, and Tmem119). For the hip-
pocampus, only one main effect of age was observed in adult 
and aged mice fed low and high fiber diets (Il-1β, p = 0.0325, 
Tnf, p = > 0.05, and Il-6, p > 0.05) (Figure S3 in Supplementary 
Material). Due to low DNA yield, we were not able to assess 
Il-1β DNA methylation in microglia. However, in the hippocam-
pus (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material), analysis of Il-1β 
DNA methylation revealed a main effect of age in Il-1β CpG2 
(p = 0.001) and an interaction (p = 0.0064) in that aged mice had 
less DNA methylation than both adult groups but adult mice with 
the high fiber diet had increased DNA methylation compared 
with adult mice with the low fiber diet. There were no differences 
as a result of diet and age in Il-1β CpG1. With regards to the 
periphery, colon, lymph nodes, and liver gene expression were 
analyzed in the same way as Figure 5. The only effect of diet was 
Ffar2 colon gene expression (p = 0.0179), in that Ffar2 increased 
in aged animals with the high fiber compared with the low fiber 
diet (Figure S4 in Supplementary Material). There were also no 
differences in LBP (Figure S3 in Supplementary Material).
DiscUssiOn
These studies tested the hypotheses that (1) peripheral admin-
istration of NaB attenuates basal inflammation and immune 
reactivity in aged microglia, (2) a high soluble fiber diet, through 
production of butyrate, attenuates peripheral and central inflam-
mation associated with aging, and that (3) a high soluble fiber 
diet attenuates aging-induced microglial hyperactivity observed 
in response to an immune challenge.
First, we demonstrated that LPS-induced Il-1β gene expres-
sion was decreased in microglia and hippocampus in NaB-
pretreated aged mice. There were similar trends in adult mice, 
but surprisingly, effects were much more pronounced in the 
aged. It has been found in other models that aged animals are 
more responsive to the effects of butyrate (24, 43), and it is sug-
gested that divergent gene expression and behavioral patterns 
in adult and aged animals from HDACi treatment may be due 
to differential chromatin modifications within the brain (44). 
Furthermore, as some of these effects of butyrate occur with 
improvements in metabolism, it may be possible that benefits are 
more pronounced in the aged because butyrate is able to counter-
act aspects of age-related metabolic dysfunction that is not seen 
in adult animals. Nonetheless, our results support the hypothesis 
that butyrate can attenuate pro-inflammatory cytokine expres-
sion in microglia, similar to previous findings (7, 8). Because 
NaB exerted an anti-inflammatory effect on microglia in our 
aged mouse model, we wanted to determine whether an increase 
in butyrate through a high soluble fiber diet had the potential to 
alter neuroinflammation.
It has previously been observed that there are distinct micro-
biomes in aged versus young mice, a finding that has been reported 
to be related to aging-induced inflammation (45, 46). Of note, 
there were lower levels of Mucuspirillum spp. and Odoribacter 
spp., and higher levels of in Ruminococcus spp., Coprococcus 
spp., and Rikenellaceae in aged versus adult mice, even though 
the mice were from the same colony, maintained in the same 
room, and fed an identical diet. Higher levels of Ruminococcus 
spp. have been observed in elderly humans and were associated 
with high frailty scores (47), while higher levels of Rikenellaceae 
have been shown in aged mice compared with adult mice (48). 
Interestingly, high fiber diets decreased both Ruminococcus spp. 
and Rikenellaceae, indicative of a potential beneficial effect. 
Surprisingly, we saw no differences in the butyryl-CoA:acetate 
CoA transferase (data not shown), a gene that is thought to be 
a valuable marker for gastrointestinal microbiota function and 
increased butyrate production/butyrate-producing bacteria (20). 
However, SCFA analysis revealed higher acetate and butyrate 
production in response to a high fiber diet irrespective to any 
significant changes in SCFA producing genes. This discrepancy 
in results may be due to the fact that mice were only on low 
and high fiber diets for 4 weeks. A longer diet intervention 
may be necessary for more pronounced changes in SCFA gene 
abundance. Furthermore, since SCFAs are essential metabolic 
regulators of the microbiome, intermediary metabolites such as 
lactate and succinate should also be considered to play a role, 
and optimizing SCFA production may require other dietary 
manipulations (49).
Colon histology revealed significant immune infiltration 
within the colon lamina propria of mice fed a lower-fiber diet, 
while aged mice on the high fiber diet exhibited relatively lower 
inflammatory infiltrate. Such an effect was not observed in adult 
mice. This demonstrates that a low fiber diet creates an inflam-
matory environment that is more pronounced in aged, and that 
a high fiber diet has the potential to limit colonic inflammation.
A surprising finding was that although fiber led to attenuated 
pro-inflammatory gene expression in the brain, these findings 
were not directly mirrored in the colon, lymph nodes, or liver. 
This could be due to length of the diet, or to the heterogene-
ous mix of cells within these tissues. Interestingly, in a recent 
study with pigs, oral NaB after 4 weeks changed regional brain 
glucose metabolism and hippocampal neurogenesis, with little 
effects on the gut, demonstrating CNS-specific effects due to 
butyrate (50). There were, however, effects of diet in the colon 
for Tjp2 and trending effects for Tjp1 and Ocln in that high fiber 
diet increased all of the genes, indicating a potential beneficial 
change in gut permeability. These findings concur with previ-
ous studies indicating the ability of butyrate to upregulate tight 
junction proteins (51). There was also a significant decrease in 
Ffar2, which may be related to decreased neutrophil infiltration 
(52). Emerging evidence indicates that the microbiome regulates 
neutrophil homeostasis and specifically that SCFAs regulates 
neutrophil-mediated inflammation (53). Moreover, with the 
greater understanding of neutrophil populations within the 
brain (54), and the fact that neutrophils have been demonstrated 
to promote Alzheimer’s like pathology and cognitive decline 
(55), this cell type is likely to play an important role in cell traf-
ficking in response to SCFAs in the brain. Further studies are 
warranted to determine whether an altered microbiome due to 
aging, inflammation, or diet could induce changes in neutrophil 
phenotype, and whether targeting neutrophils has an effect on 
the microbiome and brain.
Fiber was effective in limiting central inflammation associ-
ated with age, evidenced by lower microglial inflammatory

gene expression (Il-1β, Il-1rn, Il-6, Nlrp3, Tlr4, and Tnf). Novel 
findings also indicated differences in sensome and epigenetic 
regulator genes, suggesting that high fiber can promote changes 
in a microglial-specific and epigenetic-dependent manner. 
Since Il-1β, Tnf, and Il-6 gene expression was strongly decreased 
by diet, we correlated these genes with corresponding concen-
trations of butyrate and other SCFAs in the mice. For Il-1β 
and Tnf (trend for Il-6), higher butyrate correlated with lower 
pro-inflammatory gene expression. The mechanisms behind 
such an association are unclear, but many possible explanations 
exist, including regulation of FFARs on peripheral immune 
cells signaling to the brain or differential activation of the vagus 
nerve (56). It is important to note that not all effects seen by 
administration of butyrate were recapitulated by high fiber diet, 
so it will be important in future studies to determine the precise 
mechanisms of how high fiber diet affect microglial activation. 
For example, other SCFAs demonstrate anti-inflammatory 
properties (57) and high fiber diets can change other aspects of 
metabolism through variations in the gut microbiota leading to 
decreased inflammation (58), so these will be important avenues 
to explore.
Butyrate and other dietary factors can affect DNA methy-
lation within various peripheral tissues (59). Our findings do 
 
not indicate any changes to DNA methylation in the hippo-
campus in response to fiber feeding. These effects paralleled the 
lack of differences in inflammatory gene expression within the 
hippocampus. These findings strengthen the idea that the anti-
inflammatory changes seen with diet are likely microglial specific. 
It will be important to confirm these results in the future, along 
with modifications of histones and DNA hydroxymethy 
lation 
that are known to be affected in Il-1β (60, 61). Furthermore, 
 
it is exciting that newly discovered histone modifications such 
 
as histone propionylation and butyrylation could have the 
potential to be regulated by dietary fiber (62).
A high fiber diet was not able to effectively diminish the 
exaggerated inflammatory responses to immune challenge in 
aged mice in the same way that was demonstrated with NaB 
treatment. This may be due to route of administration, as SCFAs 
from fiber feeding are metabolized by colonocytes within the 
gut. We were unable to compare differences between the amount 
of butyrate that may have been observed in the circulation and 
brain during high fiber feeding compared to a NaB injection. 
But this will be an important future step to determine how 
much butyrate from diet can be detected directly in the brain 
or if butyrate’s mechanisms of action on neuroinflammation 
are predominantly indirect (16). However, it is interesting that 
there was an interaction of age × diet in one of the CpG sites 
analyzed for Il-1β DNA methylation, in that aged mice had less 
DNA methylation than both adult groups, but adult mice with 
the high fiber diet had increased DNA methylation compared to 
adult mice with the low fiber diet. This may indicate that DNA 
methylation is more dynamic and responsive to a dietary inter-
vention (63), but the mechanism of this is unclear. Using a lower 
dose of LPS or a live infection more accurately mimicking a typi-
cal immune response in humans may be necessary to see more 
nuanced differences and understand the epigenetic mechanisms 
involved in the inflammatory response of aged individuals.
In conclusion, data thus far support a role of high ferment-
able fiber in altering the microbiome and potentially immune 
infiltration/gut permeability, which supports beneficial micro-
glial function in aged mice. Our results suggest that the effects 
of butyrate and potentially butyrate through high fiber feeding 
are due to a combination of mechanisms, including epigenetic 
regulation, metabolic regulation, and GPCR signaling. More 
work needs to be performed to examine the mode of action of 
butyrate-producing diets in the brain and whether or not these 
results relate to the beneficial effects seen with NaB. The charac-
teristic that butyrate is synthesized endogenously via fermenta-
tion of non-digestible fibers by bacteria in the colon makes the 
prevention or at least suppression of neuroinflammatory condi-
tions such as aging possible (16). High fiber supplementation in 
the elderly therefore may be a non-invasive strategy to increase 
butyrate levels and support an environment with decreased 
chronic neuroinflammation.
