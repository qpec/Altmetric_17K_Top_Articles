Not all eligible women use the available services under India's Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY), which
provides cash incentives to encourage pregnant women to use institutional care for childbirth; limited
evidence exists on demand-side factors associated with low program uptake. This study explores the
views of women and ASHAs (community health workers) on the use of the JSY and institutional delivery
care facilities. In-depth qualitative interviews, carried out in September-November 2013, were completed
in the local language by trained interviewers with 112 participants consisting of JSY users/non-users and
ASHAs in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The interaction of impeding and enabling
factors on the use of institutional care for delivery was explored. We found that ASHAs' support services
(e.g., arrangement of transport, escort to and support at healthcare facilities) and awareness generation
of the benefits of institutional healthcare emerged as major enabling factors. The JSY cash incentive
played a lesser role as an enabling factor because of higher opportunity costs in the use of healthcare
facilities versus home for childbirth. Trust in the skills of traditional birth-attendants and the notion of
childbirth as a ‘natural event’ that requires no healthcare were the most prevalent impeding factors. The
belief that a healthcare facility would be needed only in cases of birth complications was also highly
prevalent. This often resulted in waiting until the last moments of childbirth to seek institutional
healthcare, leading to delay/non-availability of transportation services and inability to reach a delivery
facility in time. ASHAs opined that interpersonal communication for awareness generation has a greater
influence on use of institutional healthcare, and complementary cash incentives further encourage use.
Improving health workers' support services focused on marginalized populations along with better
public healthcare facilities are likely to promote the uptake of institutional delivery care in resource-poor
settings.

1. Introduction
Although the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) expired
in 2015, India is still far from achieving MDGs 4 (reduce child
mortality by two-thirds) and 5 (reduce maternal mortality by
three-quarters) (Paul, et al., 2011). As of 2013, there were 52.7
under-five deaths per 1000 live births (Government of India, 2013a)
and 167 maternal deaths per 100,000 births (Government of India,
2013b). These deaths were concentrated among lower socioeco-
nomic groups, who report lower levels of accessing of institutional
maternal and child healthcare (Pathak et al., 2010; Save The
Children, 2010). In 2005 the Government of India launched Janani
Suraksha Yojana (JSY), an integral component of National Rural
Health Mission (since 2013 the program has been called the Na-
tional Health Mission [NHM]), to promote the use of maternal and
child healthcare facilities. The JSY, launched by modifying the

 existing National Maternity Benefit Scheme, uses cash incentives to
expectant mothers and Accredited Social Health Activists (female
community health workers, known as ASHAs) to reduce maternal
and neo-natal mortality by promoting institutional delivery. The
larger institutional framework of NHM complements the JSY cash
incentive by providing comprehensive healthcare, including ante-
natal and post-natal services, transport to facilities, and support
services from ASHAs. It includes several support services admin-
istered by community health workers to encourage pregnant
women to use healthcare facilities for childbirth, along with at least
three ante-natal check-ups (Government of India, 2014c).
Program implementation was split into 18 high-focus (deprived)
and 10 low-focus (developed) states, determined by economic and
maternal and child health (MCH) indicators (Government of India,
2014c). In high-focus states, all pregnant women are eligible for the
JSY cash incentive of Indian rupee (INR) 1400 (US$1 z INR 68) per
birth, and benefits are paid irrespective of birth order, age and so-
cioeconomic position. In low-focus states, the cash incentive is INR
700, and is limited to women below the poverty line, as well as
scheduled caste/tribe women (Government of India, 2014a). Those
who registered under the JSY but delivered at home are entitled to
cash assistance of INR 500 per delivery. In addition, across all states,
the JSY provides a transport allowance (INR 300) to eligible
expectant mothers who reach healthcare facilities for delivery
without the help of ASHA for transport. For expectant mothers
reaching facilities with an ASHA's assistance, this amount is pro-
vided to the ASHA for arranging the transport (Government of
India, 2014c, 2015a). The cash incentive is deposited in the bank
account of expectant mother. To complement the JSY, the Govern-
ment of India launched Janani Shishu Suraksha Karyakram (JSSK)
on 1st June 2011 with a provision of free transport, diagnostics and
drugs to mother and newborn (Government of India, 2015a).
The NHM and its JSY program are implemented in partnership
with the state government health departments, with organiza-
tional support through officers and health committees at the dis-
trict, block, and community levels. Every village in the country
employs an ASHA to provide support services to women and chil-
dren. ASHAs are selected from the same village of residence as the
expectant mothers. ASHAs are trained to work as an interface be-
tween the community and the public health system. They are the
first port of call for any health-related demands of deprived sec-
tions of the population, especially women and children, who find it
difficult to access health services (Government of India, 2014b).
ASHAs are entrusted to i) identify pregnant women, ii) facilitate the
provision of at least three ante-natal checkups and facility-based
childbirth, iii) arrange to immunize the newborn until the age of
14 weeks, iv) make a post-natal visit within 7 days of delivery to
track mother's health, v) provide counsel for initiation of breast-
feeding to the newborn within one hour of delivery, and continuing
for 6 months, and vi) promote family planning (Government of
India, 2006). ASHAs are financially incentivized to encourage
institutional
births
(INR
600
per
institutional
delivery)
(Government of India, 2010a, 2010b, 2014c; Lim et al., 2010; Paul,
2010). From 2009 to 2010 onwards, several state governments
revised the JSY guidelines to also promote the provision of ante-
natal care. For instance, in 2009, the Chhattisgarh government
made ensuring the provision of ante-natal care one of the eligibility
conditions for payment of incentives to ASHAs (Government of
Chhattisgarh, 2009).
Since its implementation, uptake of the JSY cash incentive has
not been very high, particularly in the eight high-focus ‘empowered
action group’ states, where of women who gave birth, only 18
percent received the JSY financial benefit in 2007e08 (International
Institute for Population Sciences [IIPS] and Macro International,
2010) and 49 percent received the benefit in 2011e12 (Vellakkal
et al., 2016). In these states, there was an increase in use of
healthcare facilities for childbirth in the post-JSY periods–65
percent of all women who gave birth had used institutional delivery
care facilities in the post-JSY period of 2011e12 as compared to 25
percent of all women who gave birth in the pre-JSY period of
2000e04. Yet many pregnant women were not using the available
services (Vellakkal et al., 2016). This observation raises an impor-
tant question: why do many eligible women not use institutional
delivery care facilities to receive the JSY cash incentive?
Extant research has pointed to some possible explanations. Low
levels of information communication and education activities with
emphasis on MCH is associated with lower utilization of the JSY,
especially in rural areas (Sharma et al., 2011). In a rural area of
Varanasi of Uttar Pradesh, lower level of awareness about the JSY
was reported among women of reproductive age group, with a
significant negative effect of factors like literacy status of pregnant
women and their spouses (Kaushik et al., 2010). In the Ujjain dis-
trict of Madhya Pradesh, the non-availability of transportation, and
maternal perceptions that previous non-institutional deliveries
were ‘easy’ were also associated with the non-use of the JSY (Sidney
et al., 2012). In the state of Jharkhand, although some women were
willing to opt for institutional delivery, several obstacles prevented
uptake of the JSY cash incentive and institutional delivery care, such
as poor infrastructure, poor quality of care, difficulties in accessing
cash incentive, and corruption in disbursement of incentives (Rai
et al., 2011). Varied perception of eligibility guidelines in different
states, awareness of the program, the amount disbursed, docu-
mentation, delays in disbursement to beneficiaries and low or
irregular financial incentives to ASHAs were reported as the oper-
ation barriers of the JSY (Zodpey and VK, 2014). A study in the state
of Madhya Pradesh reported environmental factors that impeded
skilled birth attendance, including a chaotic delivery environment,
lack of staff preparedness, and unfriendly behavior of staff towards
patients (Chaturvedi et al., 2015). Regional imbalances in the
quality of the health infrastructure also endure, with high-focus
states lagging behind in implementation as compared to low-
focus
states
(Bhattacharyya
et
al.,
2012;
United
Nations
Population Fund- India, 2009).
On the other hand, a recent large-scale household survey
revealed that 59 percent of the women from high-focus states were
aware of the JSY (UNICEF, 2009). Awareness of the JSY was higher
among women from below the poverty line families (64 percent)
than above the poverty line families (58 percent), and scheduled
caste and scheduled tribe women had higher awareness of the
program than women of general caste (UNICEF, 2009). An evalua-
tion study in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Jhark-
hand, Orissa, Assam, Jammu & Kashmir, and Tamilnadu showed
that since the inception of National Rural Health Mission there was
marked improvement of basic health infrastructure with adequate
supply of human resource, material, drugs, equipment, and trans-
port system (Planning Commission, 2011).
Against this backdrop, this paper explores the factors impacting
the accessing of institutional delivery care facilities in the context of
the JSY cash incentive and the NHM. We use qualitative in-depth
interviews in the three JSY high-focus Indian states: Jharkhand,
Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
This is a cross-sectional qualitative study. Individual face-to-face
in-depth interviews (IDI) were conducted.

 2.2. Study settings
We collected data for this study in the high-focus states of
Jharkhand (lower JSY uptake, 24 percent in 2012e13), Madhya
Pradesh (higher JSY uptake, 73 percent in 2012e13) and Uttar
Pradesh (medium JSY uptake, 36 percent in 2012e13) (Office of the
Registrar General and Census Commissioner, 2016). A summary of
the socioeconomic and health indicators of the 3 states is given in
Table 1.
2.3. Participants
With the goal of assessing the factors impacting the accessing of
an institutional delivery care facility from the users' perspectives,
we interviewed eligible women (n ¼ 41), defined as women who
gave birth to a child anytime within the past six months to one year
prior to the date of interview, their spouses (n ¼ 44), and their co-
residential mothers-in-law (n ¼ 11). However, only one participant
was selected from each household–either the eligible woman or
her spouse or mother-in-law–so that we could collect a diversity of
insights from more families given the limited resources available
for the data collection. The spouses and mothers-in-law of eligible
women were included in the study because of their dominant role
in the decision-making in the Indian family context. Both women
who received and did not receive the JSY cash incentive and those
who delivered at an institutional delivery care facility and at home
were included in the sampling frame. The JSY users who opted for
home delivery are defined as those women who gave birth to a
child at home but received the JSY cash incentive. We aimed to
collect data from roughly an equal number of the JSY users versus
non-users, and also an equal number from women with institu-
tional versus home deliveries. In addition, several ASHAs (n ¼ 12)
were interviewed in order to provide complementary perspectives
on the factors impacting the accessing of institutional delivery care
facilities, as they frequently interact with the people at the local
level.
2.4. Sample selection and data collection
We used a stratified purposive sampling strategy to identify
eligible participants. Of the two districts selected from within each
state, one was relatively more developed (i.e., with improved
infrastructure and more urban and semi-urban features) while the
other one was less developed (i.e., with less infrastructure and the
presence of large number of remote rural areas). Two blocks from
each district, based on their level of development (as with the
states), were further selected. Two villages from each block were
randomly selected as the final sampling unit for identifying
eligible women, spouses and mothers-in-law. To avoid potential
selection bias, we refrained from identifying the participants
(eligible women, spouses and mothers-in-law) through the JSY
and healthcare facility related stakeholders, such as ASHAs, health
workers and the JSY officials. Instead, participants were identified
after developing rapport with some villagers whom we randomly
met at various locations. Importantly, the research team and in-
terviewers consulted each other on the final identification of the
participants to ensure that the pool of the selected participants
was a mix of those who did and did not receive the JSY incentive,
and those who delivered at home versus in a facility (as outlined
above). Efforts were made to include participants residing in
remote locations. One ASHA was randomly selected from each
block. Of the total number invited to interview, 64 percent of the
users/non-users of the JSY and 86 percent of the ASHAs agreed to
participate.
Interview guides were prepared in the local language (Hindi).
Participants were interviewed by trained interviewers at their
residences. Probes were used as needed wherever extraction of
more relevant information was possible. The interviews were
conducted in Hindi. Interviews lasted for between 25 and 50 min.
All interviews were tape-recorded and then back-translated into
English to maintain accuracy. Interviews were transcribed verbatim
by the interviewer. The transcribed interviews were further cross-
checked with the recordings by the researchers to ascertain qual-
ity and validity. Notes were also taken during the interview to
ensure no relevant information was omitted. Summary sheets were
used to capture the socio-demographic details of the participants.
The interviewers included both males and females; most of
them had educational qualifications of bachelor's degrees and
above, and all of them had previous experience conducting quali-
tative interviews. They were given further training by the study
team both on the basics of the JSY and on their interviewing skills.
Prior to the final interviews, a pre-test was conducted among the
interviewers to check the appropriateness of the interview guide, to
respond to queries raised by the interviewers, and resolve any
differences that emerged during the process. The researchers
closely monitored the data collection procedures by physically
accompanying the interview team. The study was carried out over a
period of 3 months from September to November 2013.
2.5. Data analysis
Data analysis was carried out using the basic underlying prin-
ciple of grounded thematic framework theory (Corbin and Strauss,
2008; Strauss and Corbin, 1998). The transcripts were color coded
using Atlas-Ti software. Following grounded theory, the transcripts
were read and re-read thoroughly by the authors (SV and AG) and
theories that repeatedly emerged were highlighted. To identify
repeated themes and gain additional insights on the variations in

 responses between persons and locations, the transcripts were
grouped by type of participants and districts for the reading. The
themes generated were revised after a series of discussions be-
tween authors to avoid personal bias, and then discussed with
other co-authors.
We initially followed the inductive approach to derive the
themes, followed by the deductive approach using the conceptual
framework of health service use outlined by Andersen (1995).
Andersen's model argues that healthcare utilization is a function of:
� Environment (i. healthcare system characteristics, e.g., policy,
resources, organization, and ii. external environment)
� Population characteristics (i. predisposition characteristics such
as demographic, social structure, and health beliefs, ii. resources
such as personal, family and community level resources, and iii.
realization of the need for care)
� Health behavior (i. personal health practices and ii. use of health
services),
� Outcomes (i. perceived health status, ii. evaluated health status,
and iii. consumer satisfaction)
For the assurance of analytic rigor, the senior co-authors
reviewed the qualitative data analysis (JF) and the presentation of
themes and discussion (DS, HR, and AC). The detailed discussions
on the themes among the co-authors were also helpful to minimize
the researchers' own position on the research findings. Themes
were corroborated with secondary data and available literature for
better triangulation. A comprehensive network of pathways of
utilization and non-utilization of services was then developed.
Quotations which were illustrative of the thematic material were
selected for presentation.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institu-
tional Ethics Committee, Public Health Foundation of India, New
Delhi. Participation was voluntary, and oral informed consent
(recorded) was obtained from all participants before the interview.
Participants were informed that the interviews were implemented
for research purpose, that their identity will not be disclosed for
any reason, and the study findings may be incorporated in to policy
to improve institutional delivery care services. Female participants
(except ASHAs) were interviewed by female interviewers only.
Other than the interviewer and participant, no other people,
including family members, were present in the interview site. No
incentives,
either
cash
or
in-kind,
were
provided
to
the
participants.
3. Results
3.1. Participants' characteristics
A total of 108 (36 JSY users, 60 non-users, and 12 ASHAs) in-
terviews were conducted (Table 2). The participants' age ranged
from 18 to 40 years for the JSY users/non-users, and 20 yearse40
years for ASHAs. Most of the eligible women were housewives and
few were laborers. Most JSY users and non-users were illiterate or
had attained primary level education, whereas ASHAs had, on
average, acquired education up to secondary and higher secondary
level, with a few being college graduates as well.
3.2. Awareness of the JSY
Most of the participants were aware of the JSY, explaining it as a
program where the government provides money for an institu-
tional delivery, free ambulance services for childbirth, and free
medicine and food at government hospitals. The JSY users were
more familiar with specific details of the program than non-users:
while non-users were aware of the JSY, fewer of these participants
knew either the name of the program or the amount of the cash
transfer. Most participants cited ASHAs as their major source of
information on the JSY. Less common but also cited as sources of
information on the JSY were the radio, TV, relatives, neighbors,
Anganwadi workers (who provide non-formal pre-school educa-
tion, supplementary nutrition, and nutrition and health education
through the government's Integrated Child Development Services
program), and hospitals.

nity van/ambulance] is provided to drop to hospital. [Mother:
institutional delivery, JSY user])
(I heard some money is given for delivery at government hos-
pital. [Mother: home delivery, JSY non-user])
3.3. Factors impacting the accessing of institutional delivery
Our analysis showed that the use of an institutional delivery care
facility is determined by several impeding and enabling factors,
falling into three broad categories: 1) Population characteristic-
related factors, 2) Health system and environmental-related fac-
tors, and 3) JSY-related factors. Fig. 1 shows the pathways to the use
of an institutional delivery care facility, focusing on major factors.
First, the population characteristics and health system-related
factors affect decision-making on whether or not to seek an insti-
tutional delivery care facility. Subsequently, the JSY-related factors
such as i) ASHAs' support services, ii) other specific and additional
health services offered under the JSY, and iii) the cash incentive
interact with the socioeconomic and health system-related factors
to further influence the decision and incidence of seeking an
institutional delivery care facility.
3.3.1. Population characteristic-related factors
The most commonly reported enabling factor in the decision to
use an institutional delivery care facility is the population charac-
teristics, such as the awareness among pregnant women and family
members about the value of institutional delivery care facilities for
safe childbirth.
(It is better to go hospital for the safety of mother and new born
… at home we cannot manage birth complications. [Spouse:
institutional delivery, JSY user])
The ability to pay for healthcare also positively affects the de-
cision to use an institutional delivery care facility. This result is
based on the opinion of ASHAS and our analysis of socioeconomic
status desire to use institutional delivery care rather than on direct
quotes from the interviews with JSY users/non-users.
(Many women are from poor economic backgrounds, mostly
daily workers. Using hospital for child birth is unaffordable for
them due to expenses on medicines and ‘side-payments’ [bribe]
to hospital staff [ASHA, Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh])
On the other hand, reported impeding factors include socio-
cultural elements, reflecting the lack awareness on the need of
institutional delivery care facility, and the notion of birth as a
natural event needing no institutional delivery care.
(In fact, I have no need to go to hospital … When I did not face
[a] problem then why should I go for Diagnosis/Test. [Mother:
home delivery, JSY non-user])
S. Vellakkal et al. / Social Science & Medicine 178 (2017) 55e65
58
 (It is my family practice to give birth at home. It is safe. I am
comfortable at home. [Mother: home delivery, JSY non-user])
(My all 3 children were delivered at home. Nothing wrong had
happened to me and my children. [Mother: home delivery, JSY
non-user])
(We didn't need to go anywhere (hospital) and if God is giving
everything without any difficulty so what's the problem.
[Mother: home delivery, JSY non-user])
We also found that parity played a major role in accessing of an
institutional
delivery
care
facility.
Primiparous
women,
as
compared to multiparous women (multiparous women in their 30s
in particular), expressed preference for an institutional delivery
care facility. In our sample, approximately 78 percent of primipa-
rous women and 46 percent of multiparous women had used an
institutional delivery facility. The decision of whether and when to
seek obstetric care was not taken exclusively by one person in the
family. Rather, decision-making appeared to be a household pro-
cess which evolved across the course of pregnancy. In most cases
where obstetric care was sought, we found that the expectant
mothers showed more interest in seeking care at a facility, and
spouses and other family members often supported. Overall, the
decision to seek delivery care evolved over time, and was
substantially influenced by the enabling and impeding factors
outlined in this study.
3.3.2. Health system and environmental-related factors
The health behavior of the population is impacted by previous
interactions with healthcare settings. This may include not only
women's own previous experiences directly related to delivery care
(e.g., during ante-natal care checkups), but also experiences with
non-obstetric services by the expectant mother, as well as health-
care experiences of other family members. Likewise, perceived and/
or experienced safe childbirth at institutional delivery care facilities
also acts as an additional enabling factor. Participants also
commonly highlighted the availability of good quality institutional
delivery care and support from nurses and doctors, and fully or
partially subsidized institutional delivery care facilities including
doctor and nurse services, medicines and diagnostic services as
enabling factors.
(At hospitals, there is security of health. Doctors and nurses
facilities are available there. [Mother: institutional delivery, JSY
user])
Health environment factors such as distance to an institutional
delivery care facility and inability to afford healthcare were
commonly cited by participants as impeding factors. Distance to an

 institutional delivery care facility, unaffordable institutional de-
livery care, and the poor quality of care (perceived and/or experi-
enced), particularly in government institutional delivery care
facilities, factored into decision-making as impeding factors.
(Mostly the nurses, not doctors, handle the delivery care in
government hospitals [Spouse: home delivery, JSY non-user])
(In hospitals, good doctors are not there. Electricity and water is
not always available [Mother: institutional delivery, JSY user]).
Previous experiences of safe childbirth at home and trust in
traditional birth attendants (called dai) are other impeding factors.
Most
multiparous
women who
had
safe
births
at
hospital
continued to opt for an institutional delivery care facility. However,
there were a few instances of older women opting for home birth
even if they had previous birth at facilities. This was mainly influ-
enced by the unsatisfactory quality of services available at facilities,
and the perception that the delivery can be made without the
support of medical personnel at home among those who had a
previous normal vaginal delivery at an institutional delivery care
facility.
(The dai has several years of experience. She is taking care of all
the delivery in our village. She knows everything. She helps in
delivery without much pain by putting oil. [Mother-in-law:
home delivery, JSY non-user])
In most instances, we found that the preferences for home for
childbirth over institutional delivery care facility were highly
prevalent, because of either previous episodes of or the perceived
possibility of a safe childbirth at home, and the notion of birth as a
natural event needing no institutional delivery care. This resulted in
a moderate preference among some women and their families for
using an institutional delivery care facility. Thus, an institutional
delivery care facility will be opted for on the basis of any anticipated
or emergent complications in childbirth. Most participants who
experienced an emergent complication did not get admitted to an
institutional delivery care facility well in advance, resulting in
waiting until the last moment of labor-pain at home before pro-
ceeding to an institutional delivery care facility. This finally resul-
ted, in most cases, in the inability to reach to an institutional
delivery care facility on time in such short span of time due to
distance to institutional delivery care facilities and the non-
availability of transport facilities on short notice.
([We] will go to hospital if any complication comes up. [Mother:
home delivery, JSY non-user])
(I wanted to go hospital. Mausi [Aunty] was saying ‘Let's go to
the hospital’. But I didn't get the chance, as this child was
delivered very easily. [Mother: home delivery, JSY non-user])
([The] vehicle [ambulance] was unable to reach [the house in
time], so [my child was] born at home; [a] phone call was made
to ‘sister-ji’ [ASHA], [the] vehicle did not come, and [my] child
was delivered at home. [Mother: home delivery, JSY non-user])
[Sometimes the van (ambulance) facilities to hospital are
available and sometimes not. (Mother: home delivery, JSY non-
user)]
In addition, lack of a caretaker at home for other small children
of expectant mothers was also reported to impede accessing of
institutional delivery care.
([We have] no vehicle at home. I was going to hospital and child
was born on the way, then I thought I will not go to hospital

 because it gives lots of trouble. And I have small children at
home, who will take care of them? [Mother: home delivery, JSY
non-user])
3.3.3. JSY-related factors
Several JSY-related factors served as important enabling factors
for several pregnant women and their families on switching their
preferences from home to institutional delivery care facilities. We
found ASHAs' support services and the cash incentive as two often-
mentioned JSY-related factors.
3.3.3.1. ASHAs' support services. The ASHAs played crucial roles in
countering several impeding factors and strengthening enabling
factors through awareness generation and provision of support
services. ASHAs provide person-centered awareness (i.e., inter-
personal communication for awareness generation) to pregnant
women and their family members on the necessity of childbirth at
institutional delivery care settings, ante-natal care, healthy diets,
and hygiene for the better health of mother and child. ASHAs invest
considerable efforts in identifying pregnant women and building
trust with expectant mothers and their family members. Since
ASHAs are from the same village of the expectant mothers and are
thus familiar with them and their family circumstances, the iden-
tification of each expectant mother is done either through direct
observations or through speaking to relatives and neighbors. This is
followed by building rapport with the woman and her family
members (especially with the mothers-in-law, and other senior
female members), and registering them under the JSY. A minimum
of three counseling sessions for each expectant mother are con-
ducted, occurring every alternate month during the ante-natal
phases. This process helps to establish a relationship of trust be-
tween ASHAs and expectant mothers (and their families), which
our findings suggest may aid ASHAs in overcoming impeding
factors.
(We visit village and every house of the village, and ask people
about newly married women or about women who are
expecting. And if we get to know something like this then we
register them under the JSYand counsel them. [ASHA: Hamirpur
district, Uttar Pradesh])
(We counsel about the importance of regular ante-natal check-
ups for safe delivery and health of newborn, and also about
cleanliness, washing of hands with soap after toilet, and also
about feeding the child with clean hand. [ASHA: Gwalior dis-
trict, Madhya Pradesh])
Additionally, ASHAs provide several support services to preg-
nant women such as: detecting pregnancy using pregnancy kits,
registering for ante-natal care at an institutional delivery care fa-
cility, ensuring that at least three ante-natal check-ups and all
necessary vaccinations are provided to her, making periodic home
visits (for providing basic ante-natal support to identify and refer
for any potential risks and complications, and for counseling
expectant mother and family), arranging of ambulance services,
escorting
to
institutional
delivery
care
facilities,
facilitating
communication with institutional delivery care providers, and in
post-natal care including arranging necessary vaccinations for the
newborn.
(This was my first delivery and Sahiya [ASHA] suggested for the
hospital, so only due to this we went hospital. [Mother: insti-
tutional delivery, JSY user])
(ASHA said take her [pregnant woman] to the hospitals, and the
people of my village also said to take to hospital. [Mother-in-
law: institutional delivery, JSY user])
(She [ASHA] helped us from beginning to end. She was with us
while going to hospitals and also in the hospitals, calling doc-
tors, helping in tests/check-ups. [Spouse: institutional delivery,
JSY user])
3.3.3.2. Cash
incentive
and
opportunity
costs. Importantly, we
found that the cash incentive played a lesser role in motivating the
people to opt for institutional delivery care because of the higher
associated opportunity costs. In most cases, it was reported that the
net value of the JSY cash incentive is less than the total expenses of
facility-based childbirth, in terms of both monetary and real costs.
Specific monetary costs included healthcare expenditure, food and
transport expenses for the mother and her caregivers, and loss of
wages for spouses. The real cost component consisted of discomfort
of staying at an institutional delivery care facility (and, relatedly, the
sacrifice of the comfort of staying at home with family members),
inability to attend the regular needs of children and elderly family
members, loss of schooling for children, interruptions in spouses'
employment participation, and neglect of livestock and agriculture.
Moreover, the cash incentive transfer-related factors such as
requirement of a bank account for receiving payments, delay in
reimbursement, and limitation of the cash incentive to delivery at
government and accredited private institutional delivery care fa-
cilities also made the JSY less attractive to potential users.
(I didn't want to waste my four days. I didn't want to waste my
four days wages. What is advantage there only INR 1000 or
1200. I didn't have a bank account. For bank account INR 1000
will go. Need more money in hospital. Here just giving INR 500
to dai is okay. What we finally get is nothing. [Spouse: home
delivery, JSY non-user])
(When we stay at [the] hospital for 3e4 days, who will take care
[of] our children and parents, who will take care of agriculture
and animals? [Spouse: home delivery, JSY non-user])
(Delivery at hospitals needs money. We need to buy medicines.
So many other payments to doctors, nurses and attendants [as
side payments], we need to buy special food for mother at
hospital [Spouse: institutional delivery, JSY non-user])
(We don't know how long we need to stay at hospital. Mine is
not a government job, and if I don't go to my daily job, they will
find another person to replace me. [Spouse: home delivery, JSY
non-user])
3.4. ASHAs' views on enabling and impeding factors
Overall, ASHAs noted that awareness generation about the
benefits of institutional delivery care has considerable influence
among people to encourage use institutional delivery care facilities.
Further, if the pregnant women and families are convinced of the
importance of using institutional delivery care facilities, then the
JSY cash-transfer incentivizes them further.
(JSY financial incentive does not attract people much, they are
attracted to going hospital when we give more information on
what all the facilities available there, the free services, and the
problems they would face at home deliveries and also on the dai
S. Vellakkal et al. / Social Science & Medicine 178 (2017) 55e65
61
 … people consider the safe childbirth is more important than
money. [ASHA: Tikamgarh district, Madhya Pradesh])
In some cases, however, the prevailing socio-cultural norms
impede the efforts of ASHAs.
(But most people don't fully listen to us; they have their own
strong views on whether or not to use institutional delivery care
facilities for delivery. [ASHA: Ranchi district, Jharkhand])
According to the ASHAs, the lack of sufficient infrastructure,
poor quality of care and several related expenses at government
hospitals also constraint people to use the JSY cash incentive and
institutional delivery care.
(Not many facilities are often available in government hospitals
… they raise lots of concerns of the quality and often tell us that
nurses and doctors will demand money in government hospital
… sometime staffs won't be there on holidays and weekends,
and night ….for caesarian they refer to private hospitals … and
sometime it is difficult to get the ambulance, particularly in the
night. [ASHA: Chatra district, Jharkhand])
However, the JSY cash incentive component to pregnant women
also serves as one of the windows of opportunity for ASHAs for
approaching the pregnant women and their families for promoting
the use of institutional delivery care facilities.
(I tell them [pregnant women and their families] that at hos-
pitals you will get good care, food and medicine. On top, you will
get some money from government as well. [ASHA: Ghaziabad
district, Uttar Pradesh])
ASHAs also mentioned that they received only a small monetary
reward from the government, and delays in reimbursement of
monetary benefits. The poor pay and delays in payment make them
lose interest in their work, leading to lack of motivation to
encourage institutional deliveries.
3.5. Between-state and between-participant variation
We also found slight variation in the factors impacting the
accessing of institutional delivery care facilities across the three
states. The weak preference for an institutional delivery care facility
was mostly found among the participants in Jharkhand. In Jhark-
hand, the impeding factors such as the trust in the skills of tradi-
tional health attendants, the notion of childbirth as a ‘natural event’
to take place at home, the distance to an institutional delivery care
facility, and perceived poor quality of institutional delivery care
facilities were highly prevalent. To some extent, similar patterns
were observed in the state of Uttar Pradesh. In Madhya Pradesh, we
found that the participants cited their previous bad experiences
with the institutional delivery and other government institutional
delivery care facilities, as well as quality-related issues including
corruption (bribes) and lack of doctors and nurses–particularly on
holidays and during nights–as some of their challenges. It was also
reported that often government hospitals made referrals to private
hospitals for treatment for birth complications, including those
requiring caesarean deliveries. Regarding variation by participant
type, no substantial variations were observed between eligible
women and mothers-in-law; however, most spouses of the preg-
nant women cited high opportunity costs (including both monetary
and real costs) of using a institutional delivery care facility as major
impeding factors.
4. Discussion
4.1. Key findings
This study explored views on the use of the JSY cash incentive
and institutional delivery care facilities across the 3 large high-
focus
JSY
states. We
identified
a
number of
enabling
and
impeding factors that strongly shaped decisions of women and
families to opt into or out of the JSY and institutional delivery care
for childbirth. The factors fell into three broad categories: popula-
tion characteristics-related, healthcare system and environmental-
related and JSY-related factors. ASHAs' support services to pregnant
women, including arrangement of transport facilities, escort to and
support at institutional delivery care facilities, and provision of
information about the benefits of using an institutional delivery
care facility, emerged as the most salient enabling factors. The
health workers' consistent support and services along with the
improved institutional delivery care services were most instru-
mental in switching the preferences of people from ‘home’ to a
health-facility as place for childbirth. In contrast, the cash incentive
component of the JSY was less influential in serving as an enabling
factor to access institutional delivery care facility. This was due to
the higher opportunity costs (monetary and real costs) associated
with use of health facility over home for childbirth, as well as to the
inability of the JSY payments to fully cover the monetary costs of
institutional delivery, particularly for disadvantaged groups who
may lack access to infrastructure (e.g., bank accounts, private ve-
hicles). Our study also highlighted importance of parity in accessing
of an institutional delivery care facility.
4.2. Relevance of the study findings with the literature and policy
Several quantitative studies have found that the JSY cash
incentive was associated with increases in facility-based births
(Randive et al., 2013) and declines in neonatal mortality (Gupta
et al., 2012; Lim et al., 2010; Panja et al., 2012), improvement in
immunization rates and breastfeeding practices (Carvalho et al.,
2014), declines in socioeconomic inequality in access to facility-
based care in poorer states, and a decline in maternal mortality
(Randive et al., 2014). Those studies exclusively focused on the cash
incentive elements, without examining the role played by other
components that complement the JSY, especially the ASHA support
services and additional health infrastructure of NHM. This study
provided an in-depth qualitative investigation of the role of various
factors impacting the accessing of institutional delivery care facil-
ities in the contexts of the JSY. The cash incentive alone is insuffi-
cient to overcome impeding factors such as socio-cultural notions
about the perceived safety of home deliveries and health system-
related factors. Moreover, the cash incentive is insufficient to
overcome the monetary and real costs of an institutional delivery.
Higher opportunity costs (in monetary and real terms) in opting for
institutional delivery care facilities for childbirth were identified in
our study; however simply increasing the amount of cash in-
centives alone would be insufficient to overcome barriers because
utilization of institutional delivery care is influenced by several
inter-related socioeconomic, cultural and health system factors. If
these factors can be addressed through increased awareness of the
benefits of using institutional delivery care through well-equipped
healthcare facilities, then the cash incentive can serve as a sup-
plementary incentive.
We also found that there is a socio-cultural preference for
home-based childbirth over the facility-based childbirth. This kind
of preference for home-based childbirth was also identified in
upper-middle income countries like Mexico (Hunt et al., 2002).
Previous studies have reported that the quality of care is an
S. Vellakkal et al. / Social Science & Medicine 178 (2017) 55e65
62
 important factor impacting maternal care. One study reported that
improved public institutional delivery care facilities and skilled
female health workers significantly encouraged deliveries at public
institutional delivery care facilities in India (Patel and Ladusingh,
2015). As highlighted by one study, there is a need to ensure
quality obstetric care prior to increasing coverage of institutional
facility-based births if cash transfer programs like the JSY are to
improve health outcomes (Chaturvedi et al., 2015). Our findings
highlight the importance of community health workers in the In-
dian healthcare system in order to improve accessing of health-
care– not only for delivery care but also for promoting other health
services such as infant and child care and family planning. As of
December 2014, 859,331 ASHAs were in place (Government of
India,
2015b).
We
found
that
ASHAs
were
responsible
for
providing most of the basic necessary support services, such as 1)
identifying pregnant women in their communities; 2) providing
expectant mothers with counsel on MCH issues, birth prepared-
ness, importance of safe delivery, breastfeeding and complemen-
tary feeding, immunization, and contraception; and 3) assisting
them in seeking maternal health services, including arranging
transport and accompanying them to institutional delivery care
facilities. While some observers have raised the possibility that the
incentivization of ASHAs to encourage institutional births may
discourage provision of non-incentivized services, no study has
empirically examined this concern. Future research is needed to
examine how incentives to ASHAs may shape the provision of
counseling and services.
ASHAs' support serves as a bridge between expectant mothers
and institutional delivery care facility stakeholders. This has
considerable implications for the expectant mothers and their
families, who are encouraged by ASHAs to overcome the discomfort
in interacting with the institutional delivery care facilities. This may
be particularly true for people from lower socioeconomic back-
grounds, who are unfamiliar with the setting of institutional de-
livery care facilities. Previous work from a large household level
survey found that in high-focus states, ASHAs had accompanied 54
percent and stayed with 49 percent of all the women who gave
birth in government institutional delivery care facilities (UNICEF,
2009); our findings complement this work by highlighting the
importance of ASHAs' support services in shaping women's per-
ceptions of and desire to deliver in an institutional delivery care
facility.
Apart from the aforementioned factors, we found that parity has
major role in the use of obstetric care, consistent with studies from
Sudan and Ethiopia (Mustafa and Mukhtar, 2015; Wilunda et al.,
2015). The decision to seek care is influenced not only by expec-
tant mothers, but also by family members and neighbors. A study in
Nicaragua identified the partner support, previous maternal
healthcare experiences, and the degree of communication with
other women and health workers (Lubbock and Stephenson, 2008)
while another study in India highlighted the importance of social
capital operated at the community level as a factor influencing the
decision to seek care (Story, 2014).
Another important finding from our study is that most people
believe that an institutional delivery care facility is necessary only
in the case of birth complications. This often resulted in waiting
until the last moments of childbirth to seek help from an institu-
tional delivery care facility, leading to delay/non-availability of
transportation services and an inability to reach to an institutional
delivery care facility in time. A study in Chiapas, Mexico found that
the lay population may deem a pregnancy problematic if it i) occurs
in a woman with sub-optimal pre-pregnancy conditions (e.g., high
or low maternal age, parity (first birth) history of spontaneous
abortion), ii) is accompanied by abnormal symptoms in the woman
or baby, iii) occurs in unfavorable social circumstances, or iv) is
deemed problematic by the woman and/or influential relatives
(Tinoco-Ojanguren et al., 2008). We found that a birth was deemed
problematic in the sub-optimal pre-pregnancy conditions such as
young age, parity, and miscarriage in previous pregnancy. In addi-
tion, we found that some pregnancies are deemed to be problem-
atic when nearing the delivery date and time, even in the absence
of an adverse pre-pregnancy condition. This was partly because of
the psychological pressure of delivery, discomfort felt by the
expectant mother, and the delay in delivery after the onset of pain.
This also highlights the fact that creating better infrastructure
alone, such as roads, vehicles, and institutional delivery care facil-
ities, would be insufficient to promote accessing of and utilization
of an institutional delivery care facility. There is also a need to
generate awareness among all stakeholders (including pregnant
women and their families) of delivery care on the importance of
timely decision-making instead of waiting until the last moment.
4.3. Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, this study was based
mainly on the demand side perspective, while the perspectives of
the health system stakeholders were lacking. Second, we inter-
viewed only one family member per household. Next, though we
aimed to collect data from roughly an equal number of the JSY users
and non-users, and also with institutional versus home deliveries,
we could not identify sufficient number of JSY users with home
delivery. Third, we anticipate that some socio-cultural norms
relevant to Indian settings, including the stigma associated with
accessing the benefits of programs meant for poor people, might
have influenced in the under-statement by the participants of the
importance of the cash incentive component in the decision to
access institutional delivery care. Finally, as with all retrospective
data, it is possible that the time since interview may have shaped
both the accuracy and content of women's reported birth experi-
ences and knowledge of the JSY.
4.4. Policy implications
Our findings have important policy implications, particularly as
universal health coverage is now receiving substantial national and
worldwide attention (Mills et al., 2012; WHO, 2010b). As there is no
single best path for universal coverage, the debate continues on the
best mix of healthcare alternatives, including strengthening the
supply side of public health system, and the demand side mecha-
nisms such as health insurance and conditional cash-transfer
(Kutzin, 2012; WHO, 2010b).
Over the past few years, several low- and middle-income
countries
including
Mexico,
Columbia,
Nicaragua,
Honduras,
Brazil and India have introduced public health programs with cash
incentives to increase the use of health services among poor people
(Attanasio et al., 2005). Previous studies have argued that condi-
tional cash-transfers increase the use of health services (Gertler,
2000; Lagarde et al., 2009; Maluccio and Flores, 2005; Morris
et al., 2004; Rivera et al., 2004), but are inconclusive on
improving health outcomes. While some studies reported positive
impacts (Gertler, 2000; Rivera et al., 2004), another study reported
no considerable impacts (Morris et al., 2004). However, the repli-
cability of conditional cash-transfer programs under more deprived
settings is still unclear because they depend on effective primary
healthcare and mechanisms to disburse payments (Lagarde et al.,
2009).
Cash incentives may not be sufficient in isolation for promoting
access to institutional delivery care. Findings here highlight the
importance of strengthening community health workers' support
services and better institutional delivery care facilities as enabling
S. Vellakkal et al. / Social Science & Medicine 178 (2017) 55e65
63
 factors in the accessing of institutional birth care. In this context,
several related key factors must be taken into consideration. In
particular, i) providing focused and adequate support services,
especially to pregnant women belonging to the marginalized
population groups (e.g. low income, less-educated and in remote
locations), ii) incentivizing accessing healthcare for primiparous
women and those with problematic pre-pregnancy conditions, iii)
generating awareness of and motivation towards best practices
among health workers, and iv) strengthening public primary
healthcare infrastructure. For the sake of efficiency, it may be
particularly beneficial to target primiparous women; coupled with
improvements in infrastructure and the quality of care, as women
who have a positive first birth experience may be particularly in-
clined to use delivery care services for subsequent births. Our
findings suggest that mistrust in the quality of institutional birth
care and the notion of childbirth as a ‘natural event’ that requires no
institutional delivery care are some of the impeding factors of
accessing of institutional birth care. In light of this finding, policy
interventions may also consider accommodating a wider range of
childbirth beliefs and practices by providing home-based skilled
birth-attendance services.
Given universal awareness and substantial reach of the program,
even in high focus states, the focus of the program may now be
shifted to sustaining the gains achieved so far by 1) increasing
training of ASHAs and knowledge of communities regarding the
right timing for taking women to an institutional delivery care fa-
cility; 2) strengthening the availability and accessibility of ‘24 � 7’
facilities to handle the Basic Emergency Obstetric Care Centre and
Comprehensive Emergency Obstetric Care Services cases; and 3)
ensuring the quality of each institutional delivery by supplement-
ing it with basic newborn care.
4.5. Concluding remarks
This study found that, overall, the use of maternal healthcare
facilities is largely driven by ASHAs' support services rather than
the cash incentive component. ASHAs' support services and efforts
to generate awareness of the benefits of facility-based childbirth
were major enabling factors in the accessing of delivery care. The
JSY cash incentive played a lesser role as an enabling factor because
of higher opportunity costs in the use of an institutional delivery
care facility over home for childbirth. Trust in the skills of tradi-
tional birth-attendants and the notion of childbirth as a ‘natural
event’ that requires no institutional delivery care were the most
prevalent impeding factors. The belief that an institutional delivery
care facility would be needed only in cases of birth complications
was also a highly prevalent impeding factor.
Our findings suggest that, in order to promote accessing of de-
livery care in India and other resource-poor country settings, it is
important to employ well-trained community health workers at
the grass roots level to identify and assist pregnant women.
Adequate and intensive support of community health workers is
also needed. Moreover, greater emphasis should be placed on ed-
ucation of women and their families about the value of using
institutional delivery care facilities. Finally, strengthening of public
primary healthcare facilities is needed to ensure the perception and
delivery of high quality and responsive care. In sum, a holistic
approach focused on marginalized population groups for the con-
tinuum of care from family planning, pregnancy, birth, and after
delivery is crucial for ensuring that women access institutional
healthcare. Institutional delivery care is an important subset of the
broader set of maternal healthcare needs, and facilitating women in
accessing institutional delivery care is a vital step in improving
MCH outcomes.
