OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to examine whether insulin resistance, assessed by
HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), is an independent predictor of cognitive
decline.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
The roles of HOMA-IR, fasting insulin and glucose, HbA1c, and hs-CRP as predictors of
cognitive performance and its change were evaluated in the Finnish nationwide,
population-based Health 2000 Health Examination Survey and its 11-year follow-
up,the Health 2011 study (n = 3,695, mean age atbaseline 49.3 years,55.5%women).
Categorical verbal fluency, word-list learning, and word-list delayed recall were used
as measures of cognitive function. Multivariate linear regression analysis was per-
formed and adjusted for previously reported risk factors for cognitive decline.
RESULTS
Higher baseline HOMA-IR and fasting insulin levels were independent predictors of
poorer verbal fluency performance (P = 0.0002 for both) and of a greater decline in
verbal fluency during the follow-up time (P = 0.004 for both). Baseline HOMA-IR and
insulin did not predict word-list learning or word-list delayed recall scores. There
were nointeractionsbetweenHOMA-IRand apolipoproteinE «4 (APOE34) genotype,
hs-CRP, or type 2 diabetes on the cognitive tests. Fasting glucose and hs-CRP levels at
baseline were not associated with cognitive functioning.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results show that higher serum fasting insulin and insulin resistance predict
poorer verbal fluency and a steeper decline in verbal fluency during 11 years in a
representative sample of an adult population. Prevention and treatment of insulin
resistance might help reduce cognitive decline later in life.
Alzheimer disease, the most common type of dementia, has become a major public
health concern in recent years. Targeting modifiable risk factors for cognitive decline in
midlife could delay the onset of Alzheimer disease and thus help reduce the economic
burden associated especially with the late stages of the disease (1). Diabetes is an
acknowledged risk factor for Alzheimer disease and cognitive impairment (2–4). A re-
cent review concluded that individuals with diabetes typically perform 0.3–0.5 SD units

 lower on cognitive tests across all age-
groups compared with the general popula-
tion. The mechanisms underlying these
subtle cognitive decrements, however, are
not yet well established. These decrements
most likely do not indicate early stages of
dementia, but it is possible that they lower
the threshold for developing clinical symp-
toms of dementia later in life (5).
Insulin resistance (IR) is closely associ-
ated with obesity, chronic low-grade in-
flammation, and low levels of physical
activity and it can be seen as the hallmark
of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 di-
abetes (DM2) (6). Epidemiological studies
have shown that the metabolic syndrome
in midlife increases the risk for cognitive
decline (7,8). Recent evidence suggests
that brain IR could be an important trig-
gering factor in the development of Alz-
heimer disease neuropathology (9) and
possibly a key link between the metabolic
syndrome and cognitive decline (10).
Treatment with intranasally administered
insulin has been shown to improve mem-
ory in patients with Alzheimer disease and
mild cognitive impairment (11). Previous
studies indicate that the response to in-
tranasal insulin varies according to the
patients’ sex and APOE«4 genotype (12).
There are a number of cross-sectional
studies linking IR with poorer cognitive
performance (13–17). Only two previous
longitudinal studies, to our knowledge,
examined the effects of insulin or IR on
cognitive decline over time. A study on
999men showed thathigher insulinlevels
at age 50 years predicted lower cognitive
test scores 20 years later (18). The Ath-
erosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)
cohort study (19) examined 7,148 individ-
uals at baseline for fasting insulin and
HOMA-IR. Cognitive performance was
evaluated 3 and 9 years after baseline.
The study concluded that both fasting in-
sulin and HOMA-IR were associated with
poorer cognition 3 years after baseline
and with a decline in cognitive test scores
during the 6-year follow-up for cognitive
functioning.
The aim of this study was to assess
whether IR is a risk factor for cognitive
decline during 11 years. We hypothe-
sized that IR, estimated with HOMA-IR,
is an independent risk factor for cogni-
tive decline and that, based on previous
studies, APOE«4 genotype (12,15)and sex
(12,13,15) might influence this risk.
Also, low-grade inflammation possibly
modulates the risk of cognitive decline
associated with the metabolic syndrome
(20), which is why we hypothesized that
even the association of IR and cognition
could bemodified byinflammation grade.
To test these hypotheses, we studied
3,695 individuals who participated in
the Finnish population-based Health
2000 and Health 2011 studies.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Population
Thedataforthisstudywereacquiredfrom
the Health 2000 Health Examination Sur-
vey and its 11-year follow-up survey,
Health 2011. The surveys were conducted
by the Finnish National Institute for
Health and Welfare in 2000–2001 and
2011 (21,22). The Health 2000 survey
was a nationwide, comprehensive, popu-
lation-based examination survey repre-
sentative of the Finnish adult population.
A total of 8,028 individuals aged 30 years
or older were randomly selected from the
Finnish population register from 80 health
service districts throughout Finland
using a two-stage stratified cluster sam-
pling procedure. Of the study population,
84% (n = 6,770) attended the health ex-
amination proper or the health examina-
tion at home (21).
In 2011 all the individuals alive who
belonged to the Health 2000 study sam-
ple, who still lived in Finland and who had
not refused to participate in the upcom-
ing follow-up studies, were invited to the
Health 2011 study (22).
Both studies were approved by the
Ethics Committee for Epidemiology and
Public Health in the hospital district of
Helsinki and Uusimaa, Finland. All partic-
ipants gave written informed consent for
participating in the studies.
Altogether, 3,695 individuals who had
attended the health examination proper
in 2000 (n = 6,354) and who attended the
health examination or the home health
examination in 2011 and thus had been
tested for cognition on both occasions
were included in this study. Participants
who, at baseline, had fasted for ,4 h (n =
226); who had insulin treatment or un-
known diabetes medication (n = 59); and
who had not completed the cognitive
tests (n = 127) or had missing HOMA-IR
values (n = 4) were excluded. A total of
789 individuals had died or were lost to
follow-up. A flowchart of the study popu-
lation is provided in Supplementary Fig. 1.
In the analysis of low-grade inflam-
mation and cognition, individuals with
hs-CRP values .10 mg/L in 2000 (n =
105) were excluded to eliminate the con-
founding effects of an infectious disease.
The mean age in 2000 was 49.3 years
(range 30–86), and 55.5% were women.
Measurements
Blood pressure was measured at baseline
in a sitting position from the right arm
with a standard mercury manometer
(Mercuro 300; Speidel & Keller, Jungin-
gen, Germany), and the average of two
measurements was used for the analyses.
Baseline fasting blood samples were
drawn, the duration of fasting time was
recorded, and the samples were stored
at 270°C until analyzed.
Serum cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, glucose, hs-CRP, and insulin
values were determined from the frozen
samples. Cholesterol values were deter-
mined by a CHOD PAP test (Olympus
System Reagent; OLYMPUS, Hamburg,
Germany), HDL cholesterol values by a
HDL-C Plus test (Roche Diagnostics,
Mannheim, Germany), triglycerides by a
GPO PAP test (Olympus System Reagent),
and glucose values by a hexokinase test
(Olympus System Reagent). Serum insulin
was determined by a microparticle en-
zyme immunoassay (Abbott Laboratories
Dainabot, Tokyo, Japan). HbA1c was de-
termined with an immunoturbidimetric
method (Hemoglobin A1c assay; Abbott
Laboratories). Serum hs-CRP was ana-
lyzed by an automated analyzer (Optima;
Thermo Electron Oy, Vantaa, Finland) and
an ultrasensitive immunoturbidimetric
test (Ultrasensitive CRP; Orion Diagnos-
tica, Espoo, Finland). The detection limit
for quantitation of the CRP assay was
0.20 mg/L (23). Those who fell below
this limit were given the value 0.2 mg/L
divided by 2 = 0.1 mg/L. Non-HDL choles-
terol was counted as total cholesterol
minus HDL cholesterol. HOMA-IR was
used as a measure of IR and counted by
the equation fasting insulin (mU/mL)
times fasting glucose (mmol/L) divided
by 22.5 as previously described (24).
Cognitive Tests
The participants were tested at baseline
and at follow-up for verbal fluency and
encoding and retaining verbal material
according to the Finnish version of the
Consortium to Establish a Registry for
Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) test battery
(22,23,25,26). In the verbal fluency test,
the participants were asked to list as

 many animals as possible during 1 min.
This categorical fluency test is considered
to represent both language skills and ex-
ecutive functions. In the word-list learning
test, 10 words were shown to the partic-
ipants. The participants were asked
to read the words aloud, to memorize
them, and to repeat the words they re-
member within 90 s. In 2000, if the partic-
ipant remembered all 10 words after one
round, the result was counted as a full
30 points. In 2011, all three rounds were
repeated for all participants, regard-
less of whether they remembered all
10 words after the first round or not.
The word-list learning test was used to
assess verbal learning and memory. After
5 min the participants were asked to recall
as many words as possible from the pre-
viously presented word list (word-list de-
layed recall). The delayed recall test was
used to evaluate verbal episodic memory.
The change in cognitive test scores during
the follow-up was counted as cognitive
test score in 2000 minus cognitive test
score in 2011.
Covariates
Previously reported risk factors for cogni-
tive impairment (model 1: age, sex, years
of education; model 2: also DM2, APOE«4
genotype, BMI, systolic blood pressure,
and levels of HDL and non-HDL choles-
terol and triglycerides; and model 3: all
previous covariates and Beck depres-
sion inventory [BDI] score [27], level of
physical activity, smoking, and alcohol
consumption), assessed at baseline,
were used as covariates in the analyses.
Sex, DM2, APOE«4 genotype, physical ac-
tivity score, smoking, and alcohol con-
sumption were analyzed as categorical
variables, and all other covariates were
added to the model as continuous
variables. Information on years of formal
education, current smoking, alcohol con-
sumption, and level of physical activity
was addressed by a questionnaire. Exces-
sive alcohol consumption was classified
as .24/16 doses of alcohol (12 g alco-
hol/dose) per week (for men/women).
Self-reported physical activity was as-
sessed by asking the participants how of-
ten they exercised in their free time for at
least 30 min vigorously enough to cause
sweating and breathlessness to a mild
extent. The results were classified as fol-
lows: 1 = a few times a year or more sel-
dom, 2 = two to three times a month, 3 =
once a week, four = two to three times a
week, 5 = four to six times a week, and
6 = daily. Individuals using oral diabetes
medication or who had fasting glucose
values .7.0 mmol/L were classified as
havingDM2.APOEgenotypewasassessed
in 3,469 individuals (93.8% of the study
population) who gave their written con-
sent for DNA sampling. APOE« genotyping
was performed with the MassARRAY sys-
tem (Sequenom, San Diego, California)
with a modified protocol that has previ-
ously been described (28). APOE«4 geno-
type was considered positive for subjects
with one or two «4 alleles.
Statistical Analysis
The differences between individuals
who did not attend the health examina-
tion proper or the home health exami-
nation in 2011 (n = 1,451) and those
included in this study (n = 3,695) were
analyzed by Student t test for continu-
ous variables and x2 test for categorical
variables.
For the description of the characteris-
ticsofthestudypopulation,thestudypop-
ulation was divided into three groups
according to the baseline tertiles of
HOMA-IR. The cutoff for the second tertile
was1.16and forthethirdtertile2.01. Inall
further analyses, HOMA-IR was analyzed
as a continuous variable. Before the anal-
yses, the skewed distributions of HOMA-
IR, glucose, and insulin, HbA1c, hs-CRP, tri-
glycerides, and BDI score were corrected
by a logarithmic transformation (loge). The
age- and sex-adjusted differences among
the tertiles of HOMA-IR for the character-
istics were examined by ANCOVA for con-
tinuous variables and by logistic regression
analysis for categorical variables.
Linear regression analysis was used to
examine the associations of continuous,
log-linear baseline HOMA-IR, glucose, in-
sulin, HbA1c, and hs-CRP and of the cogni-
tive test scores in 2011 and the change in
cognitive test scores from 2000 to 2011.
First, the analyses were adjusted for age,
sex, and education (model 1 [Table 2]).
Model 1 was further adjusted for APOE«4
genotype, DM2, BMI, systolic blood pres-
sure, HDL and non-HDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides (model 2 [Table 3]). The in-
teractions of HOMA-IR 3 sex, HOMA-IR 3
hs-CRP, and HOMA-IR 3 APOE«4 geno-
type and HOMA-IR 3 DM2 on cognitive
testscoresatfollow-upandforthechange
in cognition from 2000 to 2011 were ana-
lyzed in model 2. Because of the variation
in fasting times, the analyses for model
2 were performed additionally in the sub-
population who had fasted for 10 h or
longer (35.8%, n = 1,321) prior to blood
sampling.
In additional analyses model 2 was fur-
ther adjusted for BDI score, physical activ-
ity, smoking, and alcohol consumption
(model 3).
The analyses for change in cognition
over 11 years were adjusted for baseline
cognitive test scores in each model.
Statistical significance was set at P ,
0.05 for all other tests except for interac-
tions, where P , 0.1 was considered sta-
tistically significant.
There were no interactions for HOMA-
IR 3 APOE«4 genotype (all P values
.0.26), HOMA-IR 3 hs-CRP (all
P values .0.16), or HOMA-IR 3 DM2 (all
P values .0.48) on any of the cognitive
tests. The interaction for HOMA-IR 3 sex
was significant for word-list delayed recall
at follow-up (P = 0.06). Thus, sex-stratified
analyses were performed only for HOMA-
IR and this cognitive test. No other inter-
actionswerefoundforHOMA-IR3sex(all
other P values .0.29).
The analyseswere performed withJMP
Pro 11.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
The characteristics of the study popula-
tion according to the tertiles of HOMA-IR
are shown in Table 1. Individuals with
higher levels of HOMA-IR were older
(Ptrend , 0.0001), more often men than
women(Ptrend,0.0001),had feweryears
of education (Ptrend , 0.0001), and were
less often smokers (Ptrend , 0.009) than
those with lower levels of HOMA-IR (Ptrend
indicates age- and sex-adjusted differences
among the tertiles of HOMA-IR). The mean
cognitive test scores in 2000 and 2011, ac-
cording to the tertiles of HOMA-IR and ad-
justed for age, sex, and years of education,
are shown in Fig. 1.
The individuals who did not attend the
health examination proper or the home
health examination in 2011 were older
(P , 0.0001) and had fewer years of for-
mal education (P , 0.0001) than those
included in this study. The proportion of
women was similar in both groups (56.0%
vs. 55.5%, P = 0.75) (data not shown).

 insulin predicted a lower verbal fluency
score (HOMA-IR P , 0.0001, glucose P =
0.02, and insulin P , 0.0001). Levels of
HbA1c (P = 0.07), or hs-CRP (P = 0.17)
were not associated with verbal fluency
scores 11 years later. None of these
variables predicted performance on
word-list learning (all P values .0.10)
or word-list delayed recall tests (all
P values .0.61) (Table 2). Higher base-
line HOMA-IR (P = 0.004) and insulin
(P = 0.005) levels were associated
with a greater decline in verbal fluency
from 2000 to 2011 but not with a de-
cline in word-list learning (P = 0.30 and
0.44, respectively) or word-list delayed
recall (P = 0.90 and 0.94, respectively)
(Table 2).
In the linear regression model further
adjusted for the previously recognized
metabolic risk factors for cognitive decline
and APOE«4 genotype (model 2), higher
levels of HOMA-IR and insulin were inde-
pendent predictors of poorer verbal flu-
ency at follow-up (P = 0.0002 for both).
Baseline HOMA-IR or insulin levels were
not associated with word-list learning (P =
0.60 and 0.69, respectively) or with
word-list delayed recall (P = 0.38 and
0.37, respectively) at follow-up (Table 3).
In sex-stratified analyses, HOMA-IR did
not predict word-list learning perfor-
mance in men (P = 0.26) or in women
(P = 0.99) (data not shown).
Higher baseline HOMA-IR and insulin
levels predicted a greater decline in ver-
bal fluency (P = 0.004 for both) but not a
decline in word-list learning (P = 0.55 and
0.66, respectively) or word-list delayed
recall (P = 0.96 and 0.88) (Table 3).
Baseline glucose (all P values .0.12),
HbA1c levels (all P values .0.29), or
hs-CRP levels (all P values .0.26) were
not associated with any of the cognitive
tests in 2011 or with the change in cogni-
tive performance from 2000 to 2011 (glu-
cose P . 0.22, HbA1c P . 0.44, and hs-CRP
P . 0.15) in model 2 (Table 3).
The results for the additional analyses
ofmodel3andthevaluesofthecovariates
as determinants of cognitive performance
are shown in Supplementary Tables 1 and
2.HOMA-IR(P=0.01)andinsulin(P=0.02)
were independent predictors of poorer
verbal fluency at the 11-year follow-up.
The results for a decline in verbal fluency
from 2000 to 2011 were no longer statis-
tically significant for HOMA-IR (P = 0.051)
or insulin (P = 0.056, data not shown) in
this additional model of adjustment.
The proportion of individuals who were
examined after an overnight fast is shown
in Supplementary Fig. 2. The results for
the analyses of the individuals who had
fasted for 10 h or longer (n = 1,321) are
provided in Supplementary Table 3. In
these participants, HOMA-IR (P = 0.046)
and HbA1c (P = 0.01) were independent
predictors of poorer verbal fluency in
2011, and HOMA-IR (P = 0.02), insulin
(P = 0.02), and HbA1c (P = 0.04) predicted
a greater decline in verbal fluency from
2000 to 2011.
CONCLUSIONS
Here, we show that higher levels of insulin
and IR are independent predictors of
poorer verbal fluency performance and

 of a greater decline in verbal fluency dur-
ing 11 years. Insulin and IR were not as-
sociated with the word-list learning or
word-list delayed recall tests, which
were used as assessments of memory.
Sex, APOE«4 genotype, or hs-CRP levels
did not modify these results. Baseline
fasting glucose or hs-CRP levels did not
predict cognitive test scores.
Our results are consistent with, and
extend, the findings of the two previous
longitudinal studies on insulin or IR and
cognition (18,19). The follow-up study on
999 men showed that higher serum insu-
lin concentrations at age 50 years were
associated with lower cognitive z scores
(based onMini-Mental State Examination,
Trail Making A, and Trail Making B tests)
after 20 years, but this association was not
statistically significant after adjustment
for diastolic blood pressure. The longitu-
dinal associations of IR and cognition were
not reported (18). In the ARIC studyIR was
associated with a decline in delayed word
recall and first-letter fluency (19). Com-
pared with the ARIC study (19), the cur-
rent study provides a longer follow-up
period for cognitive decline, and unlike
the ARIC study, adjustments were made
for covariates closely associated with IR,
suchasBMIandlevelofphysicalinactivity,
which have been reported to increase the
risk for cognitive decline. In our study, IR
did not predict word-list delayed recall
after adjustment for age, sex, and educa-
tion.Additionaladjustmentsfor metabolic
covariates did not change our results.
However, the delayed recall test that we
used was slightly different from the test
used in the ARIC study, which could be
one possible explanation for the differ-
ence in the results regarding delayed re-
call. In both studies, the participants were
asked to learn 10 nouns andto recall them
after 5 minutes. In our study the words
were repeated three times as a list, and
in the ARIC study the words were incor-
porated in sentences. It is possible that
the CERAD word-list delayed recall test
that we used is not sensitive enough to
assess a decline in delayed memory in
middle-aged individuals.
We (15) and others (13) have discov-
ered sex differences in the cross-sectional
association of IR and cognition, suggesting
that IR would be a risk factor for poorer
cognitive performance in women but not
in men. One longitudinal study on the
metabolic syndrome and cognition,
with a follow-up of 16 years, found that
the metabolic syndrome was associated
with cognitive decline only in women
(29). These results could not be confirmed
in thepresentlongitudinalstudy.Menand
women were both susceptible to the
harmful effects of IR on cognition. Our
previous cross-sectional study showed
aninteractionforAPOE«4andIRonverbal
fluency performance. In the stratified
analyses the association of IR and poorer
verbal fluency was evident only in noncar-
riers of APOE«4 (15). Studies on intranasal

 insulin and cognition suggest that possibly
only noncarriers of APOE«4 would benefit
from treatment with intranasal insulin
(12). The explanation for these sex and
APOE«4 differences, however, is still
unclear. Here, the association of IR on cog-
nition 11 years later was similar in noncar-
riers and carriers of APOE«4. The previous
longitudinal studies (18,19) did not assess
sex or APOE«4 differences, and sex or
APOE«4 differences have not been inves-
tigated in most longitudinal studies on the
metabolic syndrome and cognition. It is
possible that the early effects of insulin
or IR on cognition are different from their
longitudinal effects. The possible modu-
lating effect of sex and APOE«4 genotype
on the association of insulin or IR and cog-
nition should be further explored in future
studies, also by using sophisticated imag-
ing techniques. A genetic and/or a sex dif-
ference in the association between IR and
cognition would necessitate personalized
preventive and therapeutic interventions
to reduce the risk for cognitive decline.
In the current study a higher level of IR
was associated with poorer performance
on the categorical verbal fluency test,
which represents the function of brain
frontal and temporal lobe regions (30)
and which can be considered as a mea-
surement of language skills and executive
function (31). In line with our findings,
cross-sectional studies (13–17) on IR
and cognition have shown associations
between higher levels of IR and poorer
executive function. There are several pos-
sible pathways to explain these findings,
since the mechanisms between IR and
cognitive decline are thought to be mul-
tifaceted. Cross-sectional brain positron
emission tomography studies with 18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose show that, consistent
with the localization of verbal fluency in
the prefrontal and temporal cortices,
higher levels of IR are associated with
lower regional glucose metabolism in fron-
tal, parietal, and temporal cortical areas
in cognitively normal adults (32) and in
adults at risk for Alzheimer disease (33). A
similar pattern of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–
positron emission tomography reduction
is seen in prodromal Alzheimer disease
(34). Brain MRI studies show that IR is
associated with lower temporal lobe
gray matter volume (14,35) but also with
lower volumes of wider areas, such as the
prefrontal cortices and precuneus (35). In
addition, brain white matter changes
seen in MRI images are more common
in individuals with the metabolic syn-
drome compared with those without
(36), and these changes are associated
with poorer verbal fluency in patients
with prodromal Alzheimer disease (37).
The symptoms of Alzheimer disease
typically begin with a decline in episodic
memory, but this decline is only clinically
evident close to the onset of the disease
(38). We did not find any association

Insulin Resistance and Cognitive Decline
Diabetes Care Volume 40, June 2017
 between IR and the CERAD word-list de-
layed recall test, a commonly used test of
episodic memory to screen for Alzheimer
disease. This could be due to our relative-
ly young study population. Late-onsetAlz-
heimer disease begins after 65 years of
age, but neuropathological changes typi-
cal to the disease can be detected years
or even decades before the onset of any
cognitive symptoms. Typically, the accu-
mulation of b-amyloid, the neuropatho-
logical hallmark of Alzheimer disease, can
be detected first in the frontal and the
temporal cortices of the brain (39). This
is interesting, since categorical verbal flu-
ency is subserved by these brain regions.
Our study has limitations. The golden
standard for determining IR, the insulin
clamp method, could not be used because
of the large, comprehensive health exam-
ination nature of this epidemiological
study. We could not control for all comor-
bid conditions associated with IR such as
sleep apnea and nonalcoholic fatty liver
disease, which have been associated
with poorer cognitive performance. Also,
we defined diabetes according to fasting
glucose values and the use of oral antidia-
betes drugs and, thus, individuals with
normal fasting glucose but elevated post-
prandial values might have been falsely
classified as not having diabetes. The
word-list learning test was performed
slightly differently in 2000 and 2011, and
this might have affected the scores of
both word-list learning and word-list de-
layed recall. However, only 17 participants
had received a full 30 points on the word-
list learning test, and excluding these indi-
viduals did not change our results. In the
word-list delayed recall, the delayed recall
section only lasted for 5 min. This test is
designed to screen for Alzheimer disease,
and it may be that in this middle-aged
population a test with a longer delay
would have been more sensitive to detect
delayed memory decline. The fasting
times of our study volunteers varied,
which might have resulted in falsely
higher HOMA-IR values for those with a
shorter fasting time. However, the base-
line HOMA-IR values were not higher for
participants who had fasted for 4–10 h
compared with those who had fasted
for .10 h. Thus, we are confident that
including participants who had fasted
for 4–10 h did not give false positive
associations between HOMA-IR and cog-
nitive performance. To confirm this,
we provide additional analyses for the
subpopulation who had fasted for 10 h
or longer. The strength of our study is
the large, population-based study cohort,
based on a nationally representative sam-
ple of the Finnish adult population. The
long follow-up time allows us to examine
the decline in cognitionassociated with IR.
In conclusion, we show that IR is an in-
dependent risk factor for cognitive decline
and, more specifically, a decline in verbal
fluency.Althoughthedifferencesbetween
the tertiles of IR in verbal fluency perfor-
mance are small, and not of clinical signif-
icance at the individual level, these subtle
changes in cognition associated with IR
could lower the threshold for more severe
changes in cognition over time. Longitudi-
nal studies involving more detailed
neuropsychological assessment and brain
anatomical and functional imaging are
needed to explore the different cognitive
domains and the neuroanatomical and
neuropathologic changes associated with
IR. Targeting therapeutic strategies, such
as lifestyle interventions, at people with IR
in midlife could potentially reduce the in-
cidence of cognitive decline later in life.
