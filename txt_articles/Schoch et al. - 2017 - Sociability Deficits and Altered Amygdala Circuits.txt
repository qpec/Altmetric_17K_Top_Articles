Abstract
Background—Behavioral symptoms in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have 
been attributed to abnormal neuronal connectivity, but the molecular bases of these behavioral and 
brain phenotypes are largely unknown. Human genetic studies have implicated Protocadherin 10 
(PCDH10), a member of the δ2 subfamily of non-clustered protocadherin genes, in ASD. 
PCDH10 expression is enriched in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in the 
social deficits of ASD. Previous reports indicate that Pcdh10 plays a role in axon outgrowth and 
glutamatergic synapse elimination, but its roles in social behaviors and amygdala neuronal 
connectivity are unknown. We hypothesized that haploinsufficiency of Pcdh10 would reduce 
social approach behavior and alter the structure and function of amygdala circuits.
Methods—Mice lacking one copy of Pcdh10 (Pcdh10+/−) and wildtype littermates (WT) were 
assessed for social approach and other behaviors. The lateral/basolateral amygdala was assessed 
for dendritic spine number and morphology, and amygdala circuit function was studied using 
voltage sensitive dye imaging. Expression of Pcdh10 and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor 
(NMDAR) subunits was assessed in post-synaptic density fractions of amygdala.
Results—Male Pcdh10+/− mice have reduced social approach behavior, as well as impaired 
gamma synchronization, abnormal spine morphology, and reduced levels of NMDAR subunits in 
amygdala. Social approach deficits in Pcdh10+/− males were rescued with acute treatment with the 
NMDAR partial agonist d-cycloserine.
Conclusions—Our studies reveal that male Pcdh10+/− mice have synaptic and behavioral 
deficits, and establish Pcdh10+/− mice as a novel genetic model for investigating neural circuitry 
and behavioral changes relevant to ASD.

Introduction
Reduced sociability, or the tendency to seek out and engage in social interactions, is a highly 
disabling and treatment-refractory core feature of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) (1). 
Epidemiological studies of ASD consistently indicate that it is more common in males than 
females; however, the biological bases of male predominance in ASD are poorly understood 
(2,3). Multiple lines of evidence point to abnormal development and maintenance of 
synaptic connections as key neurobiological features of ASD (4–7). Human linkage studies 
have identified multiple ASD-associated genes that are implicated in the structure and 
function of neuronal synapses (4,8–10) including the cadherin and protocadherin 
superfamily of calcium-dependent neural cell adhesion molecules (9,11,12). Copy number 
variants of the Protocadherin 10 (PCDH10) gene and its regulatory region have been 
associated with ASD, suggesting that it may play a role in the pathophysiology of the 
disorder (9,13).

 Pcdh10 (OL-protocadherin) is a member of the δ2 subfamily of non-clustered 
protocadherins (12) that is enriched in the mammalian brain (14). Pcdh10 is an activity-
regulated gene on murine chromosome 3 that is expressed at high levels in olfactory and 
limbic regions, including the basolateral amygdala, which is implicated in social and 
emotional behavior phenotypes in ASD (14–16). In neurons, Pcdh10 functions in a 
molecular pathway with Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) and myocyte enhancer 
factor 2 (MEF2) to regulate the stability of the post-synaptic density following neuronal 
activity (17). FMRP binds Pcdh10 mRNA transcripts and transports them to the synapse 
(17,18). At the synapse, Pcdh10 has been linked to both spinogenesis and synapse 
elimination. A synaptic transmembrane protein, Pcdh10 interacts with Nck-associated 
protein 1 (Nap1) to recruit the WAVE actin polymerization complex, a mechanism linked to 
lamellipodia extension and spinogenesis (19–21). Following neuronal activity, Pcdh10 
facilitates proteosomal degradation of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) and is 
required for MEF2-induced synapse elimination (17).
Here, we use a mutant mouse model to investigate the role of Pcdh10 in modulating 
sociability, as well as amygdala structural and functional connectivity, phenotypes relevant 
to ASD. We demonstrate a role for Pcdh10 as a regulator of sociability, and a modulator of 
synaptic function in the amygdala.
Methods and Materials
Animal Housing
All mice were cared for in accordance with the National Academy of Sciences Guide for the 
Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and all animal procedures were approved by the 
University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). 
Pcdh10+/− mice in which the first exon of Pcdh10 had been replaced with a lacZ-neo 
selection cassette were produced by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (USA) (22). Founders 
were backcrossed to a C57BL/6N genetic background for more than 15 generations 
(personal communication from Shinji Hirano). Male Pcdh10+/− mice were crossed with 
female C57BL/6J (B6) mice, to generate wild-type (WT, Pcdh10+/+) or heterozygous null 
(Pcdh10+/−) experimental animals. Experimental subjects were the offspring of at least two 
consecutive backcrosses to C57BL/6J. Same-sex littermates were group-housed with 2 – 5 
per cage in a temperature and humidity controlled environment in a 12-hour light-dark cycle. 
All mice had access to food and water ad libitum. Litters were randomly assigned to undergo 
behavior testing, electrophysiology, dendritic spine, or biochemical analysis. Behavioral 
testing and tissue collection were conducted during the light phase.
Behavior
Separate cohorts of male and female, Pcdh10+/− and wild-type littermates (WT) underwent 
different sets of behavioral tests. Cohort 1 consisted of juveniles (28–32-day-old) that 
underwent the Social Approach Test. A second cohort of Pcdh10+/− and WT mice 
underwent tests in the following order, starting at 28–32 days of age: olfactory habituation-
dishabituation (day 1), elevated zero maze (day 2), and accelerating rotarod (day 3). A third 
cohort underwent observations of repetitive behaviors (rearing, self-grooming, digging,

 circling) in the home cage (see Figure S2). A fourth cohort of juvenile mice underwent the 
social approach test 30 minutes following intraperitoneal administration of saline or d-
cycloserine. A fifth cohort of postnatal day 6 mice pups underwent measurement of 
ultrasonic vocalizations following separation from the dam and nest. A sixth cohort of adult 
Pcdh10+/− and WT mice underwent the novel object recognition task. Cohort sizes were 
similar to previously published results (23–26).
Social Approach Test—Naïve mice underwent the Social Approach Test in a darkened 
behavioral testing room, using methods described previously (23). The Social Approach Test 
in a 3-chambered apparatus is perhaps the most widely used assay of social interaction used 
to assess mouse models relevant to autism (27–34), and has been shown to have good 
reliability and ecological validity (23).
The two end chambers of the 3-chambered testing apparatus each contained an empty, 
transparent, perforated Plexiglas cylinder. For the initial 10-minute habituation phase, each 
subject was allowed to freely explore the three chambered apparatus with empty cylinders 
(Phase 1). Immediately following habituation, one cylinder was loaded with a non-social 
stimulus (paperweight) and the other cylinder with a social stimulus (same-sex adult 
gonadectomized A/J mouse) and the test mouse was allowed to explore the apparatus and 
cylinders for 10 minutes (Phase 2). Time spent sniffing each cylinder, time spent in each 
chamber, as well as the distance each test mouse traveled was scored in each Phase, using 
the automated behavioral analysis system, TopScan (Clever Systems Inc., Reston, VA, USA) 
(23). A separate cohort of mice was given a single intra-peritoneal injection of saline or 
32mg/kg d-cycloserine 30 minutes prior to testing.
Pup ultrasonic vocalizations—Postnatal day 6 (35) male and female pups were 
separated from their mother and placed alone in a glass container (10 cm × 8 cm × 7 cm; 
open surface) containing clean bedding, which was placed in an open Styrofoam container 
(20 cm × 21 cm × 12 cm) inside a sound-attenuating cabinet (Med Associates, St. Albans, 
VT), for 5 min. Ultrasonic vocalizations were recoded using an UltraSoundGate Condenser 
Microphone CM 16 (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany), placed 12 cm above the floor 
of the sound attenuating box, and an UltraSoundGate 116H audio device (Avisoft 
Bioacoustics). Recordings were made with Avisoft RECORDER software (version 4.2.14; 
Avisoft Bioacoustics) using a sampling rate of 375,000 Hz in a 16 bit format. Numbers of 
USVs emitted over 5 minutes were counted.
Neuronal reconstruction and spine counts
Adult male mice were sacrificed and whole brains were removed, rinsed in PBS, and Golgi 
impregnation was conducted using the FD Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD Neurotechnologies, 
Columbia, MD, USA). After 5 days of impregnation in kit solution A/B, brains were placed 
in solution C twice for 24hrs each. Brains were frozen and 100µm coronal sections were 
taken on a cryostat. Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides, and thoroughly dried at 
room temperature protected from light over 7 or more days. Slides were developed 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and coverslipped using Permount mounting 
medium (Thermo-Fisher, Waltham, MA). Clearly-stained spiny lateral/basolateral (LA/

 BLA) amygdala neurons located between the external and amygdala capsule fiber tracts 
were manually reconstructed using Neurolucida neuron tracing software (MBF Bioscience, 
Williston, VT) by an experimenter blinded to genotype. Traced neurons with multiple 
dendrites over 140 µm in length were selected for spine counts. Proximal (within 100 µm of 
the soma) and distal (within 100 µm of the terminus) dendritic regions (50 µm length) were 
identified on long dendrites, and all visible spines within the 50 µm region were manually 
identified and counted by type (36,37). Spine counts were performed at low focal depth to 
improve the optical resolution. A maximum of two dendrites, each with a proximal and a 
distal region were counted on one to two neurons per animal. Average spine counts of each 
type per 50 µm were calculated for each genotype. Contrast enhancement of representative 
images was applied equally to each image to increase clarity.
Electrophysiology
Voltage sensitive dye imaging (VSD) experiments were performed according to previous 
studies (38). 300µm slices from juvenile (28–32 day old) Pcdh10+/− and wild-type mice 
were stained for 15 min with 0.125 mg/ml (in ACSF) of the voltage sensitive dye di-3-
ANEPPDHQ (D36801, Invitogen, Carlsbad, CA), and imaged in an oxygenated interface 
chamber using an 80 × 80 CCD camera recording at a 1 kHz frame rate (NeuroCCD: 
RedShirtImaging, Decatur, GA). Epi-illumination was provided by a custom LED 
illuminator. Slices were continuously bathed in ACSF. Single or burst stimulation of 4–40-
mA, 200-µs pulses at 40Hz were administered with the electrode placed in the most dorsal 
region of the lateral amygdala (LA). After initial electrode placement and establishment of 
slice viability, baseline responses with control ACSF were elicited by either 12 burst 
stimulus trials, each separated by 40s.
To analyze VSD data, a data processing program was used in IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake 
Oswego, OR) to calculate change in fluorescence divided by the resting fluorescence. 
Regions of Interest (ROI) were chosen according to a standardized anatomy of the 
amygdala. The ROI for the lateral amygdala excluded the area where the electrode was 
placed. The basolateral amygdala (BLA) was ventral medial to the LA. The striatum (STR) 
was selected dorsal medial to the LA. Fluorescence-changes are calculated as the percent 
change in fluorescence divided by the resting fluorescence (%dF/F0). Colored images were 
generated in IGOR on 12-trial-averages. For gamma power analysis data was imported into 
Matlab (Mathworks, Natick, MA), and processed with the open source tool box FieldTrip 
(39). Time-locked averaged data were transformed to time frequency space using Morlet 
wavelets (40) to allow calculation of evoked power. To quantify changes in power, the region 
of the steady-state gamma was observed on the time-frequency plot, and the integral 
response was calculated using in house scripts.
Sub-cellular fractionation and semi-quantitative western blotting
Adult Pcdh10+/− and wild-type male mice were rapidly decapitated and amygdala tissue was 
collected and flash frozen. 50 mg amygdala (5 animals were pooled into three samples of 50 
mgs in each group, transgenic or wild types) were fractionated into various subcellular 
fractions using methods previously described (41,42). Protein extracts including PSD 
fractions were size fractionated in 7.5% Tris Glycine (Biorad, Hercules, CA) gels and

 western blotted with the following antibodies: PCDH10 (rat OL-protocadherin, clone 5G10, 
cat# MABT20, Millipore, Billerica, MA); β-actin (mouse, cat# A2228, Sigma, St. Louis, 
MO); PSD-95 (mouse, cat# 75-028, NeuroMab, Davis, CA); and GLUN1 (goat, cat# 
sc-1467) GLUN2A (goat, cat# sc-1468), and SRC (mouse, cat# sc-5266), all from Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). The quantified band intensities were analyzed and plotted 
using the Graph Pad Prism software; paired two tailed Student’s t test was used for between 
group comparisons.
Data analysis
Sample sizes for experiments were chosen based on adequately powered sample sizes used 
for the same types of data published by our research group and others (22,39,42–46). No 
animals were excluded from the analysis of behavior, VSDi, spine analysis, and 
biochemistry. Investigators were blinded to the genotype of mice during experiments and 
data collection, but were un-blinded during data analysis. The behavioral and structural data 
are presented as mean ±SEM. The analyses for most experiments (except electrophysiology 
experiments and where otherwise noted) were based on a mixed model regression model 
(47,48) with restricted maximum likelihood, which in this case is analogous to a fixed 
effects repeated measures ANOVA, but both allows for individual missing data points 
without imputation, and allows for greater flexibility of the variance structure of the repeated 
measures. If repeated measures were taken in the same mice (e.g., in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of 
the Social Approach Test), this was accounted for in the analysis. Analysis of ultrasonic 
vocalization data and repetitive behavior data was based on a Mixed Effects Poisson model 
which is used for count data. Analysis of electrophysiology data and the novel object 
recognition data was based on a Mann-Whitney test (the non-parametric alternative to a two-
sample t-test). In some cases, log transformations were applied for outcome variables due to 
potential non-normality, and those cases are noted in the Figure legends. The threshold for 
significance was p<0.05.
Results
Pcdh10+/− male mice exhibit reduced sociability
We tested male and female juvenile 28–32-day-old Pcdh10+/− mice and wild type littermates 
(WT) in the Social Approach Test (23,49,50) and used social cylinder sniff duration as the 
primary measure of sociability, because it is the variable in the test with the most reliability 
and ecological validity (23). Male Pcdh10+/− mice showed lower social approach, i.e, 
significantly less increase in social cylinder sniffing duration from Phase 1 (absence of 
stimulus mouse) to Phase 2 (presence of stimulus mouse) than did male WT littermates 
(phase by genotype interaction, p=0.037). Both genotypes taken together showed a 
significant increase in sniffing in Phase 2 relative to Phase 1 (main effect of phase, p=0.001). 
There was no significant difference between the genotypes in sniffing time of the social 
cylinder overall across both phases (no significant main effect of genotype) (Figure 1a). For 
duration of sniffing the nonsocial cylinder (which was empty in Phase 1 and contained a 
novel object in Phase 2), there was no significant phase by genotype interaction, main effect 
of phase, or main effect of genotype (Figure 1b). For distance traveled, there was a 
significant phase by genotype interaction (p<0.001), with a significant main effect of phase

 (p<0.001) but no significant main effect of genotype (Figure 1c). In summary, relative to 
male WT littermates, male Pcdh10+/− mice showed significantly reduced social approach but 
no change in general exploratory activity in this test.
Female Pcdh10+/− mice showed no significant difference from female WT in social 
approach (no significant phase by genotype interaction). Both genotypes taken together 
showed a significant increase in social cylinder sniffing in Phase 2 relative to Phase 1 (main 
effect of phase, p=0.001). Taking both phases together, female Pcdh10+/− mice sniffed the 
social cylinder significantly less than female WT littermates (main effect of genotype, 
p=0.039) (Figure 1d). For nonsocial cylinder sniff duration, there was no significant phase 
by genotype interaction, but there were significant main effects of phase (p=0.006) and 
genotype (p=0.022) (Figure 1e). For distance traveled, there was a significant phase by 
genotype interaction (p<0.001), a significant main effect of phase (p<0.001), but no 
significant main effect of genotype (Figure 1f). In summary, relative to female WT 
littermates, female Pcdh10+/− mice did not show a significant alteration in social approach, 
but did show some evidence for reduced exploration of both cylinders in this test. A similar 
pattern of male-specific reduction in social approach behavior was found in time spent in the 
social and non-social chambers (see Supplementary Figure S1).
General exploration was largely not affected by Pcdh10 haploinsufficiency. Neither male nor 
female Pcdh10+/− mice showed alterations in anxiety-like behavior in the elevated zero maze 
test (Figure S3a and 3b). Female, but not male, Pcdh10+/− mice showed alterations in motor 
coordination in the rotarod test (Figure S3c and 3d). Specifically, female Pcdh10+/− mice, 
relative to female WT littermates, showed a slower rate of improvement in motor 
coordination across the trials (trial by genotype interaction p<0.001). There was no 
significant effect of genotype on olfactory functioning in males or females in the olfactory 
habituation-dishabituation test (Figure S4a and 4b). There was no significant effect of 
genotype on novel object recognition in males or females (Figure S5). Male Pcdh10+/− mice 
showed a reduction in rearing behavior, but there were no other significant genotype effects 
on repetitive behaviors in males or females (Figure S2). These data show reduced social 
approach and social sniffing behavior specifically in male Pcdh10+/− mice that is not 
attributable to deficits in exploratory behavior or olfactory function.
Pcdh10+/− pups exhibit increased frequency of ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs)
Relative to same-sex WT littermates, significantly increased numbers of USVs were seen in 
both male (p<0.001) and female (p<0.001) Pcdh10+/− mice (Figure 2) at postnatal day 6. 
Increased USVs are a dysregulation of communication that have been seen in pups of some 
other mouse models of ASD (32,51).
Reduced LA-BLA transmission of gamma frequency stimulation in brain slices from 
Pcdh10+/− mice
Impairments in social cognition and emotional processing observed in ASD and other 
neurodevelopmental disorders have been correlated with changes in functional connectivity 
and temporal binding of regional brain activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range 
(52–54). Social interaction in humans and rodents strongly engages amygdala circuits

 including the basolateral amygdala, a brain region expressing high levels of PCDH10 
(15,55,56). To determine whether functional connectivity is altered in amygdala circuitry of 
Pcdh10+/− male mice, voltage sensitive dye imaging was used to optically record the 
transmission of stimulation-evoked activity from lateral amygdala to its functional targets in 
basolateral amygdala and striatum in acute ex vivo slices from juvenile mice. The lateral 
amygdala was stimulated with a train of 4 stimuli at 40Hz to mimic gamma oscillatory 
input, and the spread of evoked changes in membrane potential in the basolateral amygdala 
(BLA) and nearby ventral caudate (STR) regions were imaged (Fig. 3a). No differences 
were found in the peak amplitude of responses in amygdala (Fig. 3c1) or striatal regions 
(Fig. 3c2), indicating no change in bulk synaptic transmission from the LA to BLA and 
STR. To test if high frequency activity can be reliably transmitted from the LA to these 
areas, the fluorescent response was convolved to measure power at the 40 Hz stimulus 
frequency. Measuring stimulus evoked power from Pcdh10+/− slices revealed a significant 
reduction in the power of BLA gamma band activity (Fig. 3e1, p=0.016), but no change in 
STR gamma band activity (Fig. 3e2). These results suggest that PCDH10 modulates 
synaptic and network connectivity in the BLA. We repeated this experiment in a separate set 
of slices in the absence and presence of d-cycloserine (dCS) 20 µM. dCS did not have a 
significant effect on gamma power in the BLA (data not shown).
Abnormal dendritic spines in lateral/basolateral amygdala of Pcdh10+/− males
Because Pcdh10 has been linked to spine elimination (17), we hypothesized that the 
behavioral deficits we observed may be related to an increase in spine density in the 
amygdala of Pcdh10+/− mice. By Golgi staining, no significant genotype effects were 
observed in the number of dendrites or branch points (Fig. 4c), but, as we had hypothesized, 
the dendritic spine density was increased in Pcdh10+/− neurons of the lateral and basolateral 
amygdala (LA/BLA) (Fig. 4d). When spines were categorized by morphological 
characteristics (36,37), we found that dendrites of Pcdh10+/− neurons contain a higher 
number of thin, elongated filopodia-like spines, an immature spine morphology, compared to 
dendrites of wild-type neurons (p=0.030) (Figure 4e, Figure S6) (37,57).
Decreased GluN1 and GluN2A in the PSD of amygdala of Pcdh10+/− male mice
Impaired social behavior and reduced gamma frequency responses have been described in 
mouse models with reduced NMDAR expression (58). We performed subcellular 
fractionation to obtain protein extracts enriched for synaptic and parasynaptic membranes 
and post-synaptic density (PSD), followed by Western blotting. Pcdh10 was highly 
concentrated in extracts enriched for PSD (Figure 5a). In PSD fractions from the amygdala, 
(Figure 5b and 5c), Pcdh10+/− mice showed significantly lower levels of Pcdh10 (p<0.001), 
GluN1 (p<0.001), and GluN2A (p=0.011) than WT. In PSD fractions from prefrontal cortex 
(PFC), there was no significant difference between Pcdh10+/− and WT mice in GluN1 or 
GluN2A levels, however Pcdh10 expression is relatively low in the PFC (data not shown) 
(15).
Rescue of social deficits in Pcdh10+/− male mice with NMDAR activation
One therapeutic agent that has shown promise in improving sociability in both animal 
models and human individuals with ASD is the NMDAR glycine site partial agonist d-

 cycloserine (dCS) (59–61). Mice were treated with an acute, systemic injection of saline or 
dCS 30 min prior to social approach testing. The dose of dCS used – 32 mg/kg—is a 
moderate dose that enhances NMDA receptor function (59,62) and is a similar dose to that 
used in systemic injections to increase social approach behavior in another mouse model 
relevant to ASD (59). dCS rescued the deficit in social sniffing observed in Pcdh10+/− male 
mice (in phase 2, significant genotype by drug interaction, p=0.020) but did not alter non-
social exploration or locomotor activity (Figure 6).
Discussion
Male mice lacking a single copy of Pcdh10 exhibit atypical social approach and social 
communication behaviors, as well as altered structure and function of amygdala synaptic 
connections. Pcdh10+/− males do not show increased repetitive behaviors. The degree of 
social-communication and repetitive behavior symptoms are poorly correlated among 
humans with ASD (63), and the Pcdh10+/− model appears to be most relevant to social-
communication behaviors.
Behavioral deficits in Pcdh10+/− male mice implicate amygdala dysfunction
Abnormal amygdala structure and function has been correlated with alterations in social 
behaviors in ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders (16,53,64,65). Social interaction 
in humans and rodents strongly engages amygdala circuits including the BLA, which 
expresses high levels of PCDH10 (15,55,56). Juvenile male Pcdh10+/− mice exhibit 
impairments in social approach without alterations in general exploratory and anxiety-like 
behaviors.
Synaptic dysfunction in the amygdala of Pcdh10+/− males
Alterations in synaptic connections have been observed in the brains of individuals with 
ASD (7,66). LA/BLA neurons from adult male Pcdh10+/− mice have increased spine 
density, and that this largely reflects an increase in long filamentous processes. Increased 
spine density and extension of filopodia-like processes have been observed with 
manipulations that impair synaptic plasticity, synaptic transmission, or acutely block 
NMDAR activity (67–69). Dendrites with a dense covering of long, thin filopodia-type 
spines also have been described in adult neurons from individuals with Fragile X syndrome 
and in Fmr1 KO mice (5,70). Loss of Fragile X protein FMRP disrupts trafficking and 
translational regulation of mRNAs encoding multiple synaptic structural and functional 
proteins, including Protocadherin 10. Pcdh10 is a functional target of FMRP that regulates 
spine elimination (17), suggesting that the increase in filopodia-like spines observed in the 
Fmr1 KO may be attributed in part to reduced trafficking and function of Pcdh10. 
Elongation of spine necks is correlated with reduced charge transfer between spine head and 
the parent dendrite (71), suggesting that long filamentous spines are less effective at 
mediating synaptic transmission.

 Behavioral and neuronal abnormalities in Pcdh10+/− mice are consistent with NMDAR 
dysfunction
Increasing evidence from studies of both human subjects and mouse models implicates 
NMDAR dysfunction in the pathophysiology of ASD (44). Genetic or pharmacological 
inhibition of NMDAR function disrupts social approach behavior and alters synchronized 
gamma activity in rodent models (45,58,72). In human subjects, reduction in NMDAR 
function and amygdala evoked gamma activity have been linked to impairment in emotional 
face processing (46,65,73). In juvenile Pcdh10+/− male mice, social approach deficits are 
accompanied by reduced synaptic NMDAR GluN1 and GluN2A subunits and impaired 
maintenance of the high-frequency gamma activity in the BLA, indicating that excitatory 
synaptic transmission and local circuit integrity are disrupted within this nucleus. 
Interestingly, acute enhancement of NMDAR function with the glycine site agonist dCS 
rescued the social approach deficit observed in these mice, suggesting that existing spines 
can be modified to rescue behavioral deficits. However, dCS applied to slices did not reverse 
the reduced BLA gamma band power phenotype, suggesting that the action of dCS on this 
isolated circuit on a slice – which lacks other inputs and outputs, as well as the behavior and 
experience of the awake behaving animal -- is not sufficient to explain the effect of systemic 
administration of dCS in rescuing social approach behavior.
Male bias is an important feature of ASD models
We show that a partial loss of Pcdh10 selectively impacts social approach behavior in male 
mice. ASD is more common in males than females (2,3). X-linked disorders, such as Fragile 
X, predictably show strong sex differences, but the majority of ASD-associated genes, 
including Pcdh10, are autosomal (9,74). These differences raise intriguing questions about 
the nature of sex differences, particularly in disorders with early, pre-pubertal onset (3). 
Organizational effects of the prenatal testosterone surge on the brains of male fetuses 
represent an early window for neuroendocrine effects on neural development and early 
social behavior (75,76). Interestingly, sex hormones modulate Pcdh10 expression in non-
neuronal tissue (77), suggesting a possible mechanism by which early hormone exposure 
may underlie sex specific effects in this model. Studies of their molecular and genetic 
underpinnings of sex differences in ASD models are important future directions, and will 
ultimately provide clues to mechanisms of vulnerability and resilience.

mice. The raw data are shown in the graph, but a log transformation was required for 
normality in order to carry out data analysis. There was no significant phase by genotype 
interaction (p=0.612), main effect of phase (p=0.238), or main effect of genotype (p=0.180). 
c) Distance traveled by male mice. There was a significant phase by genotype interaction 
(p<0.001), with a significant main effect of phase (p<0.001) but no significant main effect of 
genotype (p=0.121). d) Time spent sniffing the social cylinder in female Pcdh10+/− and WT 
littermates in Phase 1 and Phase 2. The raw data are shown in the graph, but a log 
transformation was required for normality in order to carry out data analysis. There was no 
significant phase by genotype interaction (p=0.583), but there was a main effect of phase 
(p=0.001) and a significant main effect of genotype across both phases (p=0.039). e) Time 
spent sniffing the nonsocial cylinder in female mice. The raw data are shown in the graph, 
but a log transformation was required for normality in order to carry out data analysis. There 
was no significant phase by genotype interaction (p=0.888), but there were significant main 
effects of phase (p=0.006) and genotype (p=0.022). f) Distance traveled by female mice. 
There was a significant phase by genotype interaction (p<0.001), a significant main effect of 
phase (p<0.001), but no significant main effect of genotype (p=0.167).

 Figure 2. Increased ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in Pcdh10+/− pups
Analysis was performed in Avisoft SASLab Pro (version 5.2.09; Avisoft Bioacoustics) with 
the following settings: 1024 FFT length, 100% frame, Hamming window, 75% time window 
overlap, 15 and 500 kHz frequency cutoffs, amplitude threshold of −60 dB, and a hold time 
of 30ms (78). a) Male Pcdh10+/− mice showed significantly increased numbers of USVs 
relative to male WT littermates (effect of genotype p<0.001) over the 5min recording period 
on postnatal day 6. b) Female Pcdh10+/− mice also showed significantly increased numbers 
of USVs relative to female WT littermates (effect of genotype p<0.001) (Figure 2) over 
5min.

 Figure 3. Pcdh10+/− mice exhibit BLA-specific impairment for the transmission of gamma-band 
power, but not amplitude of EPSP
a1) Grey scale image of amygdala coronal slice showing the lateral amygdala (LA), 
basolateral amygdala (BLA) and striatum (STR), electrode placement and regions of interest 
(ROI). Color images show peak VSDi responses following direct stimulation of the LA in 
slices from wild-type (a2) and Pcdh10+/− (a3) males. Data were displayed as the change in 
fluorescence divided by the resting fluorescence (Δf/f0). Depolarizing Δf/f0 signals were 
displayed as warmer colors and hyperpolarizations were represented as colder colors. 
Evoked average VSDi signal responses in the BLA (b1) and STR (b2) to 4 stimuli at 40Hz 
over time are shown. Traces from wild-type mice are shown in black and Pcdh10+/− are 
shown in gray. Statistical comparisons were made using a Mann-Whitney test. No 
differences were seen in the peak amplitude response in BLA (c1) or STR (c2) between 
wild-type and Pcdh10+/− (n=5; BLA, p=0.754; STR, p=0.754). In contrast, taking the

 integral of the gamma-band response (30-50Hz) over time in both BLA (d1) and STR (d2) 
ROIs, revealed specific reduction in the gamma band coherence of the BLA in response to 
high frequency LA stimulation (BLA, p=0.016; STR p=0.917). This was specific to the LA - 
BLA circuit (e1), as functional connectivity to the striatum (e2) remained unaffected.

 Figure 4. Increased filopodia-type spines on lateral/basolateral amygdala neurons of Pcdh10+/− 
males
a) Representative dendritic reconstructions from lateral/basolateral (LA/BLA) amygdala 
neurons from wild-type and Pcdh10+/− males. b) Representative dendritic lengths from 
LA/BLA neurons from wild-type and Pcdh10+/− males. c) Counts of dendrites and branch 
points in LA/BLA of wild-type and Pcdh10+/− males. A mixed model was used to compare 
the mean dendrites and branch points between the two genotypes, while considering the 
non-independence of multiple measurements within some mice. There was no difference in 
dendrites (p=0.190) or branch points (p=0.771) between the genotypes. d) A mixed model 
was used to compare the mean spine density in the LA/BLA between the two genotypes, 
while considering the non-independence of multiple measurements within some mice. Based 
on the available literature on the role of Pcdh10 in spine elimination (17), a one-tailed test 
was applied to test our a priori directional hypothesis. Indeed, Pcdh10+/− mice had 
significantly higher spine density that WT littermates (p=0.048). e) A mixed model was fit 
separately for each spine type with a one-sided test, based on the a priori hypothesis of 
higher spine counts in Pcdh10+/− mice (17). Relative to WT, Pcdh10+/− amygdala neurons 
showed significantly higher levels of filopodia spines (p=0.030)

 Figure 5. Decreased Pcdh10 in the PSD of Pcdh10+/− males was associated with decreased 
GLUN1 in the PSD
a) Pcdh10 was found to be concentrated in the post-synaptic density fraction (psd) where 
PSD-95, the marker for PSD is most concentrated; whereas it was found to be poorly 
represented in presynaptic fraction (pre) where Synaptophysin (Synph), the presynaptic 
marker, is heavily concentrated. b) Representative blots of Pcdh10, GluN1, GluN2A and β-
actin in the PSD fractions of wild-type and Pcdh10+/− mice showing decreased Pcdh10, 
GluN1, and GluN2A in the amygdala of Pcdh10+/− mice. c) Pcdh10+/− mice showed

 Figure 6. NMDAR agonist d-cycloserine rescued sociability impairment in Pcdh10+/− males
a) Treatment with acute d-cycloserine (dCS 32mg/kg) increased social exploration in 
juvenile Pcdh10+/− males. The raw data are shown in the graph, but a log transformation was 
required for normality in order to carry out data analysis. A mixed model was fit including 
the effects of phase (1,2), genotype (Pcdh10+/−, WT), and drug (dCS, vehicle) on social 
cylinder sniffing. There was a significant phase by genotype interaction (p=0.020), but no 
other significant 2-way interactions. There were significant main effects of phase (p<0.001), 
genotype (p<0.001), and drug (p=0.019). To help interpret the genotype and drug effects, a 
separate model was fit for phase 2 only. In this model, there was a significant genotype by 
drug interaction (p=0.020) with significant main effects of genotype (p=0.006) and drug 
(p=0.001). b) Treatment with dCS and non-social cylinder sniffing. The raw data are shown 
in the graph, but a log transformation was required for normality in order to carry out data 
analysis. In a mixed model including phase, genotype, and drug, there was a significant 
phase by genotype interaction (p=0.020) but no other significant interactions. There were 
significant main effects of phase (p=0.009), genotype (p<0.001), and drug (p=0.026). To 
help interpret the genotype and drug effects, a separate model was fit for phase 2 only. In 
this model, there was no significant genotype by drug interaction (p=0.730) and no 
significant main effects of genotype (p=0.251) or drug (p=0.217). c) Treatment with dCS 
and distance traveled. In a mixed model including phase, genotype, and drug, there was a 
significant three-way interaction of phase by genotype by drug (p=0.046), but no significant 
two-way interactions. There was also a significant main effect of phase (p<0.001), but no 
main effects of genotype (p=0.386) or drug (0.158) on distance traveled. To help interpret 
the of genotype and drug effects, a separate model was fit for phase 2 only, which found a 
significant genotype by drug interaction (p=0.009) with a main effect of genotype (<0.001) 
but not drug (p=0.156).
