ABSTRACT
It is unclear whether warfarin is protective or harmful in patients with ESRD and atrial fibrillation. This state of
equipoise raises the question of whether alternative anticoagulants may have a therapeutic role. We aimed to
determineapixabanpharmacokineticsatsteadystateinpatientsonhemodialysis.Sevenpatientsreceivedapixaban
2.5 mg twice daily for 8 days. Blood samples were collected before and after apixaban administration on days 1 and
8 (nondialysis days). Significant accumulation of the drug was observed between days 1 and 8 with the 2.5-mg dose.
The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours increased from 628 to 2054 ng h/ml (P,0.001).
Trough levels increased from 45 to 132 ng/ml (P,0.001). On day 9, after a 2.5-mg dose, apixaban levels were
monitored hourly during dialysis. Only 4% of the drug was removed. After a 5-day washout period, five patients
received 5 mg apixaban twice daily for 8 days. The area under the concentration-time curve further increased to
6045 ng h/ml (P=0.03), and trough levels increased to 218 ng/ml (P=0.03), above the 90th percentile for the 5-mg
dose in patients with preserved renal function. Apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily in patients on hemodialysis resulted in
drugexposurecomparablewiththatofthestandarddose(5mgtwicedaily)inpatientswithpreservedrenalfunction
and might be a reasonable alternative to warfarin for stroke prevention in patients on dialysis. Apixaban 5 mg twice
daily led to supratherapeutic levels in patients on hemodialysis and should be avoided.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a very common arrhythmia,
affecting up to 2% of the general population in the
developedworld,anditisassociatedwithafivefoldrisk
of stroke and a threefold incidence of congestive heart
failure.1 Its prevalence is highest in hemodialysis, af-
fecting 19.5% of patients according to 2013 US Renal
Data System data.2 Patients on dialysis with AF have
significantly higher 1-year mortality rates compared
with those without (hazard ratio [HR], 1.72 after ad-
justment for age, sex, and race; 95% confidence in-
terval [95% CI], 1.70 to 1.73).3 Patients on dialysis are
also at increased risk of ischemic or hemorrhagic
stroke compared with the general population (age-
adjusted relative risk, 6.1; 95% CI, 5.1 to 7.1).4
Warfarin use is one of the most successful in-
terventions in medicine, preventing nearly two
thirds of strokes in the general population of pa-
tients with AF.5 However, whether vitamin K an-
tagonist (VKA) treatment is protective against
ischemic stroke in patients on dialysis remains
unclear. There are no randomized, controlled tri-
als directly comparing VKAs with placebo in pa-
tients on dialysis. Several well conducted cohort
studies have attempted to answer this question,
but their findings have been contradictory, with
most studies not showing any clear harm or ben-
efit from warfarin administration in patients on
dialysis with AF.6–11

 Apixaban is a direct oral anticoagulant agent (DOAC) in-
hibiting the coagulation factor Xa (FXa). It has high affinity for
human FXa, with an in vitro Ki of 0.08 nM and a 30,000-fold
greater selectivity over other coagulation proteases.12 Fifty-six
percent of the drug is recovered in the feces, with the urinary
excretion representing 24.5%–28.8% of the recovered dose.
There are no significant long-lasting metabolites present in
the circulation.13 In healthy volunteers, the peak concentra-
tion (Cmax) is achieved at 2 hours on average after an oral
single dose of 2.5 mg, with an average elimination half-life
(t1/2) of 9.7 hours after 7 days of consecutive twice daily ad-
ministration. The mean Cmax and trough concentration
(Cmin) are 83.6 and 19.7 ng/ml, respectively. The increase in
apixaban exposure seems proportional to the increase in dose,
and the steady state is achieved within 48 hours.14
The Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thrombo-
embolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation (ARISTOTLE) Trial com-
pared apixaban with warfarin (target international normalized
ratio [INR] 2–3) in patients with AF and at least one additional
risk factor for stroke.15 Apixaban was prescribed at the dose of
5mgtwice daily. A reduced dose of2.5 mgtwice daily was chosen
for patients with at least two of the following three criteria:
age $80 years old, weight #60 kg, or serum creatinine between
133 and 221 mmol/L. Patients with creatinine .221 mmol/L or
calculated creatinine clearance ,25 ml/min were excluded from
the study. Apixaban was superior to warfarin for the prevention
of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) and systemic embolism
(1.27% versus 1.6% per year; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.95).
The rate of major bleeding events was lower with apixaban com-
pared with warfarin (2.13% versus 3.09% per year; HR, 0.69;
95% CI, 0.6 to 0.8). The study also showed a mortality benefit
associated with apixaban administration: all-cause mortality of
3.52% versus 3.94% per year (HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.8 to 0.99).
Those trends persisted in a post hoc analysis of patients with a
creatinine clearance inferior to 50 ml/min, with an HR of 0.70
for stroke or systemic embolism (95% CI, 0.48 to 1.03) and an
HR of 0.59 for major bleeding (95% CI, 0.45 to 0.77).16
In the original drug labeling approved by the Food and Drug
Administration in December of 2012, apixaban was not recom-
mended for patients with creatinine clearance ,25 ml/min. The
label was subsequently amended in January of 2014 to include
patients with advanced or end stage CKD. The reduced dose of
2.5 mg twice daily was recommended in those patients who also
had either a body weight #60 kg or an age $80 years old.17 This
recommendation, which was not included in the European or
Canadian labeling, was solely on the basis of one study that re-
ported single 5-mg dose pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmaco-
dynamicdatainpatientswithESRDonhemodialysis.18Thisstudy
showed a 36% increase in apixaban area under the concentration-
time curve (AUC) compared with healthy subjects. Therefore, it is
likely that patients with ESRD could be overexposed by at least
36% with the standard 5-mg twice daily dose. Furthermore, no
data exist on apixaban pharmacokinetics at steady state (i.e., after
exposure for a few days), and accumulation leading to suprather-
apeutic and potentially toxic drug levels cannot be excluded.
This study aimed to determine apixaban pharmacokinetics
at steady state in stable patients on hemodialysis at the doses of
2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily. In addition, the effect
of a single 4-hour dialysis session on the pharmacokinetics of
apixaban at steady state was studied.
RESULTS
Sevenpatientswereenrolledinthefirstphaseofthestudy.Sixof
them participated in phase 2, and five participated in phase 3.
Mean age was 62615 years old. Five were men, and two were
women. Five were white, one was Asian, and one was Afro-
Caribbean. They were on RRT for 563.3 years. All had a urine
output of ,200 ml/24 h. Their mean body mass index was
32.966.3 kg/m2.
Significant accumulation of the drug was observed between
days 1 and 8 with the 2.5-mg twice daily dose. The AUC in-
creased by 2–5.4 times during the first part of the study,
reflecting a significantly higher exposure at steady state com-
pared with the exposure after a single first dose. Similarly, the
Cmax and Cmin significantly increased between days 1 and 8
(Figure 1). Table 1 shows the PK parameters for the first phase
of the study.
Trough levels, peak levels, and drug exposure (as estimated
by area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours
[AUC0–24]) at steady state (day 8) with the dose of 2.5 mg twice
daily approximated the previously reported median values
with this dose in patients without advanced CKD (Table 1).
Compared with the levels shown with the 5-mg twice daily
dose in patients without advanced CKD, the 2.5-mg twice daily
dose achieved an AUC0–24 at steady state close to the 10th
percentile in our patients on hemodialysis. Cmin and Cmax
were above the 10th and 5th percentiles, respectively. Predial-
ysis levels on day 5 were similar to the respective values on day 8.
Six patients had apixaban levels measured hourly during
dialysis on day 9. Figure 2 shows the average drug levels during
the first 4 hours after apixaban administration on day 8 (non-
dialysis day) and day 9 (4-hour dialysis session starting imme-
diately after apixaban administration). Only 4% of the drug
was removed by dialysis.
Five patients received apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 8 days.
During this third phase of the study, the AUC further increased
by 2–5.7 times compared with the steady state achieved with
the 2.5-mg twice daily dose. Statistically significant increases
of the Cmax and Cminwere also observed (Figure 3). Mean AUC
and trough levels were above the 90th percentile. The drug
half-life was more prolonged in patients with the highest peak
and AUC values. Table 2 shows the PK parameters for the third
phase of the study.
One patient experienced a minor bleeding event with the
5-mg dose (hemorrhoidal bleeding with no change in hemo-
globin level). No other adverse effects were observed or re-
ported. Hemodialysis had to be interrupted due to the circuit
clotting only once.

 DISCUSSION
This is the first study assessing multiple-dose administration of
apixaban in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. We report
three important findings. First, significant accumulation of the
drug was observed between days 1 and 8 with the 2.5-mg twice
daily dose. Second, apixaban levels at steady state with the
2.5-mg twice daily dose were close to the
expected median values in patients who
qualified for a reduced apixaban dose in
previously conducted randomized, con-
trolled trials and above the 10th percentile
of the expected values with the full dose
(5 mg twice daily).19,20 Third, we report
supratherapeutic drug exposure and
trough levels with the 5-mg twice daily
dose (i.e., above the 90th percentile of the
predicted levels for this dose).
Two studies have evaluated the pharma-
cokinetics of apixaban after a single dose in
patients with advanced CKD or ESRD com-
pared with healthy individuals.18,21 These
studies identified modestly increased expo-
sure in renal failure and suggested that dose
adjustment is not necessary on the basis of
renal function alone. Our study shows
that a single-dose approach can be mislead-
ing. As our results indicate, the drug accu-
mulates for the first few half-lives until
reaching a steady state, and exposure is sig-
nificantly higher at steady state compared
with that observed after a single dose. The
average accumulation index is 3.6 (geomet-
ric mean of 3.4), significantly higher than
the one observed in studies in healthy in-
dividuals with this dose (geometric mean
in the 1.3–1.7 range).14,22 Similarly, the in-
terperson variability is another potential
confounder in single-dose studies, whereas
our study compared drug exposure in the
same individuals across different dosing
regimens, reducing interperson variability
to a minimum. Therefore, previous dosing
recommendations on the basis of single-
dose studies in patients with ESRD com-
pared with healthy individuals should be
interpreted with caution.
A potential concern is whether the drug
could further accumulate after day 8, ren-
dering our results inconclusive. However,
it is widely accepted that medications
reach steady state after five half-lives
(i.e., in 48 hours for apixaban).14 Al-
though apixaban half-life can be signifi-
cantly prolonged in patients with ESRD
who receive a higher dose, the 8-day administration period
selected in our study should be adequate, even for a half-life
prolonged to 36 hours. The longest half-life value that we
observed in this study was 30 hours. Furthermore, predial-
ysis levels on day 5 (phase 1) were similar to the respective
values on day 8, suggesting that the steady state had already
been reached on day 5.

CLINICAL RESEARCH
 On the basis of our results, apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily
results in similar PK indices in patients on hemodialysis as
5 mg twice daily in patients with preserved renal function.
Trough levels on day 8 were very close to the median values
observed with the same dose in a phase 2 study of 1238 patients
undergoing total knee replacement surgery.19 Drug exposure
analysis, as estimated by the AUC0–24, yielded similar results.
On the contrary, the 5-mg twice daily dose was associated with
trough levels and an average AUC0–24 above the 90th percen-
tile observed or estimated in the above-mentioned study with
the same dose. Therefore, we strongly recommend against the
use of apixaban 5 mg twice daily in patients on hemodialysis to
avoid undue adverse effects, namely major bleeding events.
Some diurnal variation in apixaban exposure may exist. In
thiscase,doublingtheareaundertheconcentration-timecurve
from 0 to 12 hours (AUC0–12) may have
slightly overestimated the AUC0–24. To ad-
dress this potential limitation, we also ex-
amined the AUC0–12 values, comparing
them with the area under the curve extend-
ing to infinity (AUCinf) reported by Wang
et al.18 after a single 5-mg dose in patients
with ESRD (Table 2, row 2). Although the
AUCinf should represent a higher exposure
than the AUC0–12, our AUC0–12 values were
1.6–1.9 times higher than the reported
AUCinf, confirming our observations with
the other PK parameters.
The question then arises as to the clinical
efficacy of the 2.5-mg twice daily dose in
patients on hemodialysis. As described
above, the drug exposure obtained with this dose, as estimated
by the AUC0–24, was in the predicted range for the 2.5-mg
twice daily dose and very close to the 10th percentile of the
predicted AUC0–24 with the 5-mg twice daily dose.19 Interest-
ingly, on the basis of data from the ARISTOTLE Trial with
apixaban in nonvalvular AF, average peak and trough levels
observed in our study with the 2.5-mg twice daily dose are
between the 5th and 95th percentiles predicted for apixaban at
steady state for not only the 2.5-mg twice daily dose but also,
the 5-mg twice daily dose.20 Notwithstanding the pharmaco-
logic data cited above, it is plausible that both 2.5- and 5-mg
twice daily doses could be similarly protective against throm-
bus formation in AF. Indeed, both doses showed comparable
efficacy against symptomatic recurrent venous thromboem-
bolism or death from venous thromboembolism with the ex-
tended treatment of venous thromboem-
bolism in the Apixaban after the Initial
Management of Pulmonary Embolism
and Deep Vein Thrombosis with First-
Line Therapy-Extended Treatment Trial.23
Could apixaban be used instead of war-
farin in patients on hemodialysis? Several
observational studies with warfarin have
yielded contradictory results, with most
of them not showing any clear benefit
from VKA administration in dialysis.6–11
One recent study reported that VKA use
may be associated with a survival benefit
at 90 days; however, this was partially offset
later during the follow-up, with patient age
and history of stroke strongly influencing
those benefits.24,25 Even when started on
warfarin, up to two thirds of patients on
dialysis discontinue the drug during the
first year, and the mean time in therapeutic
range is as low as 49%.11,26 VKAs have also
been implicated in the pathogenesis of vas-
cular calcification in patients with ESRD,
because one of the major endogenous

 inhibitors of calcification is vitamin K de-
pendent.27 Despite the absence of random-
ized or prospective data with the DOACs,
their use in patients with advanced CKD or
patients on dialysis is becoming increas-
ingly prevalent. Chan et al.,17 using data
from Fresenius Medical Care, found that
11.6% of patients on dialysis with AF are
receiving DOACs, with apixaban being pre-
scribed in most patients (10.5%). These
agents had similar safety and efficacy pro-
files in patients with moderate kidney dis-
ease compared with those with preserved
renal function.28 In our opinion, appropri-
ate dose adjustment, such as we recom-
mend in this article and suggested
elsewhere,29 is essential for the FXa inhib-
itors to be used with success in this popu-
lation. A review of available registry data
alongside pharmacologic studies could
provide more evidence until randomized
trials are conducted. In the interim, ne-
phrologists may consider obtaining at least
one trough level after 7–10 days of apixaban
use, especially in patients with a high risk of
bleeding or receiving medications that could
interact with apixaban.
We also confirm the previously reported
observation that hemodialysis has no
appreciable effects on apixaban plasma
concentration.18 This is not surprising, be-
cause apixaban is highly protein bound. In
case of a bleeding event, reversal of the an-
ticoagulant activity with prothrombin
complex concentrate should be attempted
instead of dialysis.20 Andexanet, a specific
reversal agent that binds FXa inhibitors
with high affinity, has shown promising
results in phase 2 and 3 randomized clini-
cal trials, and its commercial availability
will facilitate the management of bleeding
complications in patients on FXa inhibi-
tors.30 Holding heparin during dialysis in
patients on apixaban may increase the
risk of the circuit clotting. Therefore, we
recommend against this practice in pa-
tients on apixaban 2.5 mg twice daily.
A limitation of our study is that we used
an FXa-based assay to estimate apixaban
plasma concentration instead of directly
measuring it with mass spectrometry.
However, a dose-dependent increase in
anti-Xa activity has been shown with a lin-
ear relationship to apixaban concentra-
tion.14 The assay has been validated against
Figure 3. Comparison of the PK parameters at steady state (i.e., after 8 days of
apixaban administration) achieved with the reduced dose (2.5 mg twice daily) and with

 mass spectrometry.31,32 Quantification of apixaban using
chromogenic anti-Xa assays with specific calibrators and
controls is now considered to be reliable and accurate.31 It
may constitute the method of choice for apixaban monitor-
ing in clinical practice, because mass spectrometry is not
widely available.31,33 We did not measure the prothrombin
and the partial thromboplastin time, because those assays
are unreliable in patients receiving the DOACs.33 We did not
recover any dialysate to formally measure the apixaban re-
moved by dialysis, but it is unlikely that this amount was
significant given the similar exposure to the drug in the same
patients on dialysis and nondialysis days. We did not use
hemodiafiltration that might have reduced apixaban levels
due to the removal of large molecular weight molecules via
convection. Although all of our patients were on phosphate
binders, the trough levels on day 8 (p.m.) and day 9 (a.m.)
were similar, suggesting no effect of the binders on the
absorption of the evening apixaban dose.
Finally, our study was not designed to de-
tect any clinical outcomes, and the prac-
tical implications of our results need to be
confirmed by dedicated prospective, ran-
domized clinical trials.
In conclusion, apixaban at the currently
recommended dose of 5 mg twice daily led
to supratherapeutic levels in patients on he-
modialysis and should be avoided in this
population. On the contrary, the reduced
dose of 2.5 mg twice daily resulted in drug
exposure that was comparable with that of
the standard dose in patients with pre-
served renal function. These data suggest
that apixaban might be a reasonable alter-
native to warfarin for stroke prevention in
patients with ESRD and AF, and a randomized clinical trial is
warranted.

 Interventions
Phase 1: Apixaban Exposure after a 2.5-mg Single Dose and at
Steady State
Seven patients received an oral dose of 2.5 mg apixaban twice daily for
8 consecutive days (Figure 4). The first day of drug administration
was a nondialysis day, preceding one of the two midweek dialysis days.
Venous blood samples were collected immediately before (0) and 0.5,
1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 hours after apixaban administration
for PK analyses on days 1 and 8 as well as before dialysis on days 5 and
7. Blood samples were stored at 280°C until assay. No unfractionated
or low molecular weight heparin was administered on dialysis days.
The dialysis circuit was flushed with saline at regular intervals to
prevent clotting.

Sixoftheinitiallyselectedpatientsparticipatedin this phase.Onday9,
they received 2.5 mg apixaban immediately before starting hemodi-
alysis (12 hours after the second oral dose of day 8; Figure 4). Dialysis
was performed for 4 hours at a blood flow rate of 300–400 ml/min
and a dialysate flow rate of 500 ml/min using a high-flux dialyzer
(Phylther HF 15G; Bellco or Revaclear Max; Baxter). Blood samples
were collected immediately before dialysis and then hourly until the
end of the dialysis session.
Phase 3: Apixaban Exposure at Steady State with a 5-mg Dose
Twice a Day
Five of the patients who completed phase 2 participated in this phase
after a 5-day washout period. They were prescribed 5 mg apixaban
twice daily for 8 consecutive days (Figure 4). Venous blood samples
were collected immediately before (0) and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9,
12, and 24 hours after apixaban administration on day 8.
Subjective tolerability was evaluated by questioning the patients
about any adverse events or spontaneous reporting of adverse events.
Pill counts were performed by study staff at each visit to assess ad-
herence with apixaban. A discharge evaluation took place 3 days after
the last dose.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was AUC0–24. The AUC across one dosing
interval (AUC0–12) was initially calculated and then doubled to esti-
mate AUC0–24. Secondary outcomes were Cmax, Cmin, time to peak
apixaban concentration, t1/2, and accumulation index. The PK param-
eters (AUC0–12, Cmax, Cmin, time to peak apixaban concentration,
and t1/2) were estimated by standard noncompartmental methods
using the software WinNonlin, version 6.2.1 (Pharsight, Mountain
View, CA).
Apixaban Assays
Apixaban concentration was determined in the plasma using the chro-
mogenic anti-Xa method.31,33 Anti-FXa activity was determined with
the HemosIL Liquid Anti-Xa Reagent (Instrumentation Laboratory
Company, Bedford, MA) in the Instrumentation Laboratory ACL
TOP700 CoagulationAnalyzeraccordingtothe manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Anti-FXa activities were converted to apixaban concentrations
using the Biophen Apixaban Control-Control Low and the Biophen
Apixaban Calibrator-Calibrator Low Kits (Hyphen BioMed, Neuville-sur-
Oise, France). The calibrators and controls are calibrated against an
internal standard for apixaban, which is established against the liquid
chromatography mass spectrometry method. The calibrator curve cov-
ers the range from 25 to 700 ng/ml for the calibrator kit and the range
from 0 to 120 ng/ml for the calibrator low kit.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the baseline characteristics
of the patients and present the PK parameters of apixaban. Values are
expressed as mean6SD. The coefficient of variationwas defined as the
SD divided by the mean and is expressed as a percentage. The paired
t test was used to compare the PK parameters of each individual
across the different doses-time intervals. The software Microsoft Ex-
cel, version 14.6.6 (Microsoft Corporation, Santa Rosa, CA) and SPSS
(version 20.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) were used.
