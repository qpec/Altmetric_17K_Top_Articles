Zika virus (ZIKV) is spreading rapidly into regions around the world where other
flaviviruses, such as dengue virus (DENV) and West Nile virus (WNV), are endemic.
Antibody-dependent enhancement has been implicated in more severe forms of flavivirus
disease, but whether this also applies to ZIKV infection is unclear. Using convalescent
plasma from DENV- and WNV-infected individuals, we found substantial enhancement of
ZIKV infection in vitro that was mediated through immunoglobulin G engagement of
Fcg receptors. Administration of DENV- or WNV-convalescent plasma into ZIKV-susceptible
mice resulted in increased morbidity—including fever, viremia, and viral loads in spinal
cord and testes—and increased mortality. Antibody-dependent enhancement may explain
the severe disease manifestations associated with recent ZIKV outbreaks and highlights
the need to exert great caution when designing flavivirus vaccines.
Z
ika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted
flavivirus endemic to parts of Africa and
Asia. After its discovery in 1947, the virus
remained relatively obscure until 2015, when
a large outbreak occurred in Brazil and rap-
idly spread outward to other countries in South
and Central America (1). Today, ZIKV is endemic
to several U.S. territories, mainly Puerto Rico,
and active ZIKV transmission has been reported
in Florida and Texas as of February 2017 (www.
cdc.gov). The widespread outbreaks, the virus’s
association with microcephaly and other neuro-
logical disorders, and its long-term persistence
in human tissues, leading to sexually mediated
transmission and potentially infertility, have taken
the medical community by surprise and raise major
public health concerns. Whereas many questions
remain unanswered about the unusual biology
and disease spectrum of this flavivirus, there is
urgency in determining whether antibodies against
other flaviviruses could enhance ZIKV replication
and disease pathogenesis. Antibody-dependent
enhancement (ADE) of different dengue virus
(DENV) serotypes has been shown to correlate
with increased viremia and disease severity (2–4).
ZIKV is phylogenetically related to other flavi-
viruses, such as DENV and West Nile virus (WNV),
which cocirculate with ZIKV in many regions
across the globe. In the United States and its ter-
ritories, WNV and DENV are endemic, causing
annual outbreaks of infection. South and Central
America and Southeast Asia have experienced
many outbreaks associated with all four DENV
serotypes, which have resulted in hundreds of
millions of DENV-seroconverted individuals in
these geographical areas (5). Accordingly, as ZIKV
continues to spread, understanding how preex-
isting flavivirus immunity affects ZIKV patho-
genesis is a high priority.
In all flaviviruses, the envelope (E) protein is a
primary target of neutralizing antibody responses
(6, 7), and recent studies show that ZIKV E protein
is highly structurally similar to that of DENV and
WNV (8, 9). Several studies have evaluated DENV-
specific monoclonal antibodies and/or a limited
number of immune plasma samples for activity
against ZIKV (10–14). Collectively, these studies
showed that in vitro, some DENV antibodies are
cross-reactive to ZIKV and can enhance ZIKV
infection at specific concentrations. However,
enhancement of ZIKV infection by DENV anti-
bodies in vivo was not observed (12, 13). Another
important question is whether enhancement can
also be driven by immunity to other related flavi-
viruses, such as WNV. This is particularly per-
tinent given that more than 3 million people in
the United States alone possess preexisting anti-
bodies to WNV (15)—a virus that is also endemic
throughout parts of Europe, Africa, the Middle
East, and Australia (16).
To begin understanding the cross-reactivity
of related flaviviruses to ZIKV and the implications
for enhanced infection, we evaluated convales-
cent plasma from 141 immunoglobulin G (IgG)–
positive DENV-infected blood donors and 146
IgG-positive WNV-infected blood donors identi-
fied through routine screening of blood donations

 in Puerto Rico and the United States, respectively
(table S1) (17, 18). In contrast with the plasma of
random blood donor controls in which no bind-
ing to ZIKV E protein was observed, a wide varia-
bility of binding activity to ZIKV E protein was
detected for both DENV- and WNV-immune
plasma (Fig. 1A). The former showed >350-fold
greater binding (P < 0.0001) and the latter showed
>35-fold greater binding (P < 0.0001) compared
with controls. To evaluate the biological proper-
ties of these cross-reactive antibodies, we eval-
uated enhancement of ZIKV infection in vitro
for each individual donor sample by using Fcg
receptor (FcgR)–bearing human-derived K562
cells. We observed a high level of overall ADE
activity among the flavivirus-exposed individ-
uals compared with controls (P < 0.0001; Fig.
1B), with significantly higher enhancement ef-
fects observed in DENV-exposed individuals
(P < 0.0001). To further understand the rela-
tionship between ZIKV-reactive antibodies in
human plasma and enhancement of infection,
we plotted binding as a function of enhance-
ment for all DENV- and WNV-immune plasma.
We found a strong positive correlation between
levels of reactivity to ZIKV E protein and en-
hancement of infection for both the DENV- and
WNV-immune plasma (Fig. 1, C and D). Because
of the large number of study participants, ZIKV
cross-reactivity and ADE among the DENV- and
WNV-seropositive donors were evaluated for cor-
relations to gender, age, severity of disease (fig.
S1), and DENV serotype (fig. S2). Interestingly,
for both DENV- and WNV-infected donors, a
weak positive correlation to age was observed.
DENV-1–positive samples had a trend toward
higher enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) titers and ADE than DENV-4–positive
samples, but the difference was not statistically
significant (fig. S2). Evaluation of the ZIKV-
neutralization potency of a subset of DENV-
and WNV-immune plasma samples revealed that
only the highly cross-reactive DENV-immune plas-
ma samples were capable of neutralization (fig.
S3). These data indicate that preexisting immu-
nity to DENV and WNV can enhance ZIKV in-
fection in vitro.
ADE is primarily mediated through the en-
gagement of IgG antibodies with cell surface
FcgRs (19, 20). We therefore tested whether the
ADE induced by DENV- and WNV-immune
plasma was IgG-mediated. To do this, we as-
sessed the ADE activity of plasma pooled from
control, DENV-, and WNV-infected blood do-
nors (15 per group) as compared with that in
purified IgG from these same samples (hereafter,
control, DENV, and WNV IgG). Blood donors used
for pooling were individually tested for ADE acti-
vity (figs. S4 to S6). Of note, these plasma samples
were tested for the presence of viral nonstructural
protein 1 (NS1) and were found to be negative
(DENV samples only; fig. S7). ZIKV was preincu-
bated with serially diluted pooled plasma or
purified IgG, and these mixtures were then
used to infect K562 cells. Overall, enhancement
activity was maintained for both DENV and WNV
IgG, suggesting that IgG is the primary plasma
component involved (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, IgG-
depleted plasma did not enhance infection, indi-
cating that ADE in K562 cells was solely at-
tributable to the IgG fraction (Fig. 2B). Given the
role of FcgRs in mediating ADE, we also investi-
gated the dependency of DENV- and WNV-specific
ADE on IgG-FcgR engagement. To do this, we
preincubated K562 cells in the presence or ab-
sence of purified FcgR binding inhibitor (BI;
eBiosciences) before infection with ZIKV in the
presence of serially diluted DENV, WNV, or
control IgG. ZIKV ADE was ablated in the pres-
ence of the FcgR BI, suggesting that enhance-
ment indeed occurs through FcgRs (Fig. 2C).
Because K562 cells mediate ADE through FcgRIIA
(21–23), we next preincubated these cells with
either an antibody against CD32, which blocks IgG
binding to FcgRII, or a control antibody against
CD16, which blocks IgG binding to FcgRIII, a
receptor that is not expressed on K562 cells. The
addition of the antibody against CD32 com-
pletely inhibited the ADE induced by DENV
and WNV IgG (Fig. 2D), whereas ADE was still
robustly observed in the presence of the anti-
body against CD16 (Fig. 2E). This suggests that
IgG-FcgRIIA interactions are specifically respon-
sible for the enhanced infection in K562 cells. We
further verified this by treatment of purified IgG
from control, DENV-, or WNV-positive donors
with peptide N-glycosidase (PNGase) F. PNGase
F removes N-linked glycans from the Fc domain
of IgG, which are necessary for FcgR engagement
(24). This treatment specifically ablated the ability
of DENV and WNV IgG to induce ADE (Fig. 2F),
whereas the ability of purified IgG to bind ZIKV,
as assessed by ELISA, was identical irrespective of
PNGase F treatment (fig. S8). Together, our data
demonstrate that IgG elicited by infection with
DENV and WNV is capable of mediating ADE of
ZIKV through FcgR engagement in vitro.
Given the binding and enhancement effects
observed with DENV- and WNV-convalescent plas-
ma in vitro, we next evaluated whether ADE could
occur during ZIKV infection in vivo. Several studies
with numerous flaviviruses have shown that viral
proteins antagonize the host innate immune re-
sponse through targeting STAT2 (25–29). In pilot
studies, we also evaluated the replication of ZIKV

 in different mouse strains and discovered that
Stat2−/− C57BL/6 mice displayed considerable
morbidity and mortality in response to infection
(30). Therefore, Stat2−/− mice were given pooled
immune plasma from control, DENV-, or WNV-
positive donors. Two hours after transfer, all
mice were infected with ZIKV strain PRVABC59
and monitored daily for survival, weight loss, and
clinical symptom development.
In response to ZIKV infection, mice that re-
ceived control plasma exhibited a 93.3% survival
rate (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the vast majority of
mice that received DENV-positive donor plasma
succumbed to infection by day 8 (21.4% sur-
vival rate; P < 0.05 compared with mice receiv-
ing control plasma). These mice also exhibited
significant weight loss (Fig. 3B) and an enhanced
clinical symptom score (Fig. 3C), marked by the
development of severe neurological symptoms
including paralysis of several limbs and, in some
cases, total body paralysis. We also observed a
decreased survival rate among mice receiving
WNV-immune plasma (60% survival; Fig. 3A),
although this difference was not statistically dis-
tinct. Symptoms were less severe in mice re-
ceiving control plasma or phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS). These results correlated directly
with the differences in measured ZIKV cross-
reactivity (Fig. 1).
To further assess clinical symptom develop-
ment, core body temperatures were measured
daily before and for several days after infection.
Before infection, all mice showed an average
body temperature between 36° and 37°C. Mice
receiving control plasma showed a small but in-
significant increase in body temperature on day
3, rising to an average of 37.6°C. However, mice
that received DENV-positive plasma developed
fever on day 3 postinfection, averaging 38.3°C.
Mice receiving WNV-positive plasma also devel-
oped fever (38.0°C), although not as high as that
in the DENV-positive plasma group (Fig. 3, D to G).
To our knowledge, this is the first animal model
showing a direct correlation between ADE and
fever. Fever was the only symptom observed in
the sentinel monkey in 1947 from which ZIKV
was isolated and identified (31) and is the hall-
mark clinical feature in individuals with dengue
hemorrhagic fever, West Nile fever, and ZIKV
infections (1, 4, 32–34).
In humans, ADE caused by secondary infec-
tion with a heterotypic DENV strain can result in
increased viremia, enhanced clinical symptoms,
and mortality. To characterize ZIKV replication
in the context of preexisting antibodies against
DENV or WNV in vivo, we measured viral loads
in the blood and several organs known to be as-
sociated with ZIKV infection and sexual trans-
mission. In the blood of mice receiving control
plasma or PBS, ZIKV RNA levels were elevated on
day 3 and then decreased on day 6 postinfection
(Fig. 4A). Mice receiving DENV-positive donor
plasma had a significantly elevated viremia, with
>10-fold higher levels on day 3 compared with
mice receiving control plasma or PBS. Mice that
received WNV-immune plasma also had signif-
icantly higher viremia at this time point, with
about a twofold increase compared with mice
receiving control plasma or PBS. These differ-
ences in viremia were no longer detectable by
day 6. Furthermore, ZIKV was detected in the
spinal cord and testes in all groups of mice (Fig.
4, B and C), but titers were significantly elevated
in mice receiving plasma from DENV- or WNV-
seropositive donors. Immunofluorescent staining
of ZIKV NS3 in the spinal cord and testes con-
firmed these observations, showing elevated ZIKV
staining in mice receiving DENV- and WNV-
infected donor plasma in comparison with that in
the mice receiving control plasma or PBS (Fig. 4,
D and E). Interestingly, ZIKV staining in the
testes was primarily located in the region con-
taining spermatid. We also tested ZIKV levels
in several additional organs, including the brain,
ovaries, and eyes, but found no differences in
viral titers (Fig. 4, F to H). Together, our data
suggestthat ADE induced by cross-reactive DENV
and WNV antibodies exacerbates in vivo viremia,
which may lead to more efficient viral spread
to the spinal cord and testes, two organs as-
sociated with human ZIKV disease and sexual
transmission.
To further understand the relationship be-
tween DENV and WNV antibody titers and the
potential for enhanced ZIKV disease in vivo, we
evaluated a range of doses for control, DENV-,
and WNV-immune plasma and their subsequent
effects on ZIKV infection. High concentrations of
DENV-immune plasma (200 ml per mouse) re-
sulted in protection against ZIKV infection, with
100% survival, no weight loss, and decreased
symptoms. Lower concentrations (20 and 2 ml per
mouse) showed clear enhancement, with nearly
identical survival, weight loss, and symptom deve-
lopment (fig. S9). In mice injected with WNV-
immune plasma, we observed a dose-dependent
response, with a trend of higher survival and bet-
ter symptom outcome with higher concentrations

 of plasma. Notably, the highest dose of control
plasma (200 ml) resulted in a decrease in survival
and greater symptom development, suggesting
that a nonspecific response (e.g., from polyreactive
antibodies) may occur at high plasma concen-
trations. However, comparison of control plasma–
injected mice with mice receiving DENV- and
WNV-immune plasma at high concentrations
highlights the protective effects of cross-reactive
flavivirus antibodies when present at sufficient
concentrations. These data suggest that in vivo
enhancement may occur optimally at low con-
centrations of ZIKV-reactive IgG, whereas high
levels may be protective.
To evaluate which DENV-neutralizing titers
correlate with ADE in vivo, we assessed the neu-
tralizing activity of mouse plasma 2 hours after
transfer of 200, 20, or 2 ml of the pooled human
plasma from controls or DENV-exposed indi-
viduals. We detected no neutralization activity in
mice injected with 20 or 2 ml of DENV-immune
plasma and only residual neutralization of
DENV in mice injected with 200 ml of DENV-
immune plasma (fig. S10). These results resemble
titers of humans with waning immune responses
after natural exposure to DENV (35, 36).
In addition to DENV and WNV, there are sev-
eral clinically relevant flaviviruses and flavivirus
vaccines that may also induce ADE. Particularly
relevant in South America is yellow fever virus
(YFV), for which a vaccine has been commer-
cially available since the 1930s and has consid-
erably reduced the disease burden (37). To test
the extent to which preexisting immunity against
YFV could promote ADE of ZIKV infection, serum
samples from macaques vaccinated against YFV
using the 17D strain were evaluated for binding
to ZIKV E protein and enhancement of ZIKV in-
fection in vitro (fig. S11). Compared with prebleed
samples, sera obtained from all three macaques
30 days after 17D vaccination (“early immune”
phase) showed negligible reactivity to ZIKV E

 protein, as assessed by ELISA, and no ADE ac-
tivity on K562 cells; weak reactivity and enhance-
ment were observed for one of three macaques
during the “late immune” phase (between 6
and 12 months after vaccination). For comparison,
we also tested serum samples from DENV-
infected macaques (n = 4), in which cross-
reactivity to ZIKV E and in vitro ADE were
robust at 30 days postinfection (early immune)
and even stronger in the late immune phase. The
response observed for DENV in the macaques
fell well within the range observed in DENV-
infected humans (Fig. 1). Although the numbers
of animals used in this experiment are small,
these data suggest that flaviviruses that are
phylogenetically and serologically more distant
from ZIKV may have progressively less cross-
reactivity (38, 39). Another possibility is that
attenuated flavivirus vaccines induce lower IgG
titers that lead to less cross-reactivity and,
therefore, less enhancement. In any case, our
data suggest that YFV vaccination poses little
risk of enhanced disease outcome if followed by
ZIKV infection, particularly within the first 30
days after vaccination.
This study reports a large-scale analysis of
ZIKV binding and enhancement by human im-
mune plasma obtained from individuals infected
with DENV and WNV. We show that the natural-
ly occurring polyclonal antibody responses against
WNV in humans are cross-reactive to ZIKV and
can enhance ZIKV in vitro and in vivo. WNV-
elicited antibodies appear to show less cross-
reactivity and enhancement compared with
DENV-elicited antibodies in vitro. Likewise, WNV-
immune plasma in mice results in a less aggres-
sive ADE phenotype compared with that in mice
receiving the same amount of DENV-immune
plasma. We also describe a mouse model of ZIKV
infection that recapitulates ADE in vivo, result-
ing in clinically relevant phenotypes that mimic
human disease. Furthermore, we show for the
first time that fever in mice directly correlates
with enhanced viral replication exacerbated by
the presence of preexisting antibodies against
other flaviviruses. Other studies evaluating the
effect of DENV monoclonal antibodies on the
pathogenesis of ZIKV in vivo found no enhance-
ment of ZIKV disease (11, 12). Possible reasons for
these differences may involve the mouse model
used or the concentration of antibodies tested.
Further, it is unclear whether strains of ZIKV
from distinct lineages or geographic locations
induce ADE to different extents. Preliminary
studies using the Nigeria 1968 and Cambodia
2010 strains of ZIKV revealed distinct ADE
curves in vitro (fig. S12). Furthermore, our study
used polyclonal plasma for in vivo studies, rather
than monoclonal antibodies, mimicking natu-
rally occurring immunity. This may have also
contributed to differences in outcome. Of note,
it has been shown that antibodies against ZIKV
can enhance DENV infection in vivo (11).
The breadth of flavivirus-induced ADE of
ZIKV infection is unclear, but it includes at least
DENV and WNV. Other clinically relevant vi-
ruses for which natural infection and large-
scale vaccination campaigns have resulted in
large numbers of seropositive individuals around
the world—such as YFV, Japanese encephalitis
virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus—may
be included. Given the high prevalence of DENV
antibodies in the geographical areas most af-
fected by ZIKV, our results suggest that preexist-
ing immunity to DENV may have contributed
to the rapid spread of ZIKV in the Americas and
possibly is associated with increased viremia
and clinical symptoms, including microcephaly.
In addition, the high prevalence of WNV an-
tibodies in the United States raises concerns if
ZIKV continues to spread into North America.
Our results also have broad implications for
vaccine efforts against DENV, WNV, and other
flaviviruses. Cross-reactive antibodies induced
by these vaccines might lead to enhanced in-
fection when individuals are subsequently ex-
posed to ZIKV. Our results highlight the urgent
need for epidemiological studies in humans to
understand the impact of preexisting flavivi-
rus antibodies on ZIKV-induced disease and
sequelae, while exercising great caution in the
design and use of flavivirus vaccines in ZIKV-
affected areas.

vaccination had very little effect.
Generally, WNV antibodies were less disease-enhancing than DENV antibodies, and, in macaques, yellow fever
antibodies enhanced ZIKV viremia, especially in the spinal cord and testes, whereas high titers remained protective.
