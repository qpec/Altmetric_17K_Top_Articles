Predicting major bleeding in patients with
noncardioembolic stroke on antiplatelets
S2TOP-BLEED
ABSTRACT
Objective: To develop and externally validate a prediction model for major bleeding in patients
with a TIA or ischemic stroke on antiplatelet agents.
Methods: We combined individual patient data from 6 randomized clinical trials (CAPRIE, ESPS-2,
MATCH, CHARISMA, ESPRIT, and PRoFESS) investigating antiplatelet therapy after TIA or
ischemic stroke. Cox regression analyses stratified by trial were performed to study the associ-
ation between predictors and major bleeding. A risk prediction model was derived and validated
in the PERFORM trial. Performance was assessed with the c statistic and calibration plots.
Results: Major bleeding occurred in 1,530 of the 43,112 patients during 94,833 person-years of
follow-up. The observed 3-year risk of major bleeding was 4.6% (95% confidence interval [CI]
4.4%–4.9%). Predictors were male sex, smoking, type of antiplatelet agents (aspirin-clopidogrel),
outcome on modified Rankin Scale $3, prior stroke, high blood pressure, lower body mass index,
elderly, Asian ethnicity, and diabetes (S2TOP-BLEED). The S2TOP-BLEED score had a c statistic
of 0.63 (95% CI 0.60–0.64) and showed good calibration in the development data. Major bleed-
ing risk ranged from 2% in patients aged 45–54 years without additional risk factors to more than
10% in patients aged 75–84 years with multiple risk factors. In external validation, the model had
a c statistic of 0.61 (95% CI 0.59–0.63) and slightly underestimated major bleeding risk.
Conclusions: The S2TOP-BLEED score can be used to estimate 3-year major bleeding risk in
patients with a TIA or ischemic stroke who use antiplatelet agents, based on readily available
characteristics. The discriminatory performance may be improved by identifying stronger predic-
tors of major bleeding. Neurology® 2017;89:936–943

Antithrombotic therapy is a cornerstone in secondary stroke prevention, either with oral an-
ticoagulants in patients with a cardioembolic stroke or with antiplatelet agents in patients
with a stroke from arterial origin. Antiplatelet therapy successfully reduces the number of
serious vascular events by approximately 25%.1,2 Despite its proven benefit, antiplatelet
therapy increases the risk of bleeding. On average, bleeding risks are increased 2-fold in
patients on aspirin compared with placebo.3 More potent treatment strategies such as dual
antiplatelet therapy increase this risk even further.4 Bleeding events appear to be associated
with future major vascular events and higher mortality rates.5,6 Different factors have been
proposed that increase bleeding risk, including older age, hypertension, and ethnicity.6–8
Prediction of bleeding risk based on patient characteristics may help physicians to balance

 benefits and risks of antiplatelet therapy for
individual patients. Also, risk stratification
may guide treatment decisions for other pre-
ventive strategies, such as gastroprotective
agents. A recent systematic review showed
that a limited number of prediction models
are available for prediction of bleeding in
patients on antiplatelet therapy for second-
ary prevention.9 In an external validation
study, accurate performance of available
models could not be confirmed in patients
with a TIA or ischemic stroke.9 The purpose
of the current study was to develop and
externally validate a prediction model to pre-
dict the 3-year risk of major bleeding in pa-
tients with a TIA or ischemic stroke who use
antiplatelet agents.
METHODS Study population. The design of the individual
patient data (IPD) meta-analysis has been described in detail
elsewhere.10 Briefly, we collected IPD from trials investigating
the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in long-term secondary
prevention after a TIA or ischemic stroke. Trials were eligible if
they randomized patients with a TIA or ischemic stroke to
aspirin, or to antiplatelet drugs that are recommended as first-
line treatment in secondary prevention of stroke as an alterna-
tive to aspirin or in addition, and had a duration of at least 1
year. Trials had to be published before December 2010 in peer-
reviewed journals. Six trials met the inclusion criteria (CAPRIE,
ESPS-2, MATCH, CHARISMA, ESPRIT, and PRoFESS11–16),
including 48,023 patients with a TIA or ischemic stroke
between 1989 and 2006. Median follow-up ranged from 1.4 to
3.5 years. Details of studies included in the IPD meta-analysis
(recruitment period, details of antiplatelet regimens, inclusion
criteria, and sample size) are presented in table e-1 at
Neurology.org.
Patients with a possible cardioembolic origin of their stroke
(those with a history of atrial fibrillation or TOAST classification
cardioembolic stroke) were excluded. Also, patients randomized
to dipyridamole alone or placebo were excluded, as our interest
was in bleeding risk on common antiplatelet regimens after
a TIA or ischemic stroke.
We used trial-specific definitions of major bleeding (table
e-2). Major bleedings included bleedings that were fatal, intracra-
nial, required hospital admission, or led to significant disability.
The outcome was assessed at regular follow-up visits, as specified
in the trial protocols (table e-3). Information on candidate predic-
tors was available at the time of outcome assessment.
We performed a literature review to identify candidate predic-
tors of major bleeding. Candidate predictors had to be easily avail-
able in clinical practice, and their inclusion was dependent on
availability in the trials. We refrained from the inclusion of inter-
actions in our model because we were not aware of clear evidence
in the literature on potentially relevant interactions. Potential pre-
dictors included patient characteristics (age, sex, Asian ethnicity,
body mass index [BMI], smoking, and heavy alcohol use), char-
acteristics of the index event (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] and
lacunar stroke subtype), medical history (hypertension, hypercho-
lesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, prior stroke or TIA, cardiovascular
disease, and heart failure), and type of the antiplatelet agent.
Information on candidate predictors was collected at baseline in
each trial. Definitions of candidate predictors are presented in
table e-4.
Statistical analysis. Ten outcome events per candidate predic-
tor is generally accepted as a minimum required sample size to
develop multivariable prediction models.17,18 Given the large
number of outcome events available in our study, a sufficiently
large number of candidate predictors could be studied.
The proportion of missing data within each trial was low; the
percentage of (sporadically) missing values across all candidate
predictors and all trials was below 1%. Some candidate predictors
were not measured in all trials and were therefore missing system-
atically (table e-5). Only variables that were available in at least 5
of 6 trials were considered for inclusion in the prediction model.
Missing data were imputed multiple times with the MICE pack-
age in R, creating 20 imputed sets.
Restricted cubic splines were used to assess whether continu-
ous predictors (age and BMI) could be analyzed as linear terms or
needed transformations. A squared term for age was found to be
significant; BMI under 30 kg/m2 showed a linear association with
the outcome. We studied predictors of major bleeding with Cox
regression analyses stratified by trial, thereby estimating common
predictor effects and separate baseline survival functions per trial.
The full model containing all candidate predictors was simplified
by performing backward selection based on the Akaike Informa-
tion Criterion. The proportional hazards assumption was checked
by studying log-minus-log plots. The final baseline survival func-
tion was estimated based on a Cox regression model in all data
pooled, with the linear predictor as the sole variable.
We assessed both discrimination and calibration. Calibration
reflects the correspondence between the observed and predicted
probabilities of the outcome and was assessed using the Gronnes-
by and Borgan test and graphically with calibration plots.19 Dis-
crimination reflects the ability of the model to distinguish
between someone with and without the outcome and was evalu-
ated using the concordance statistic (c statistic).20
We performed internal-external cross-validation, a method
which allows us to study the consistency and performance of
a model across different data sets.21 A model was developed in
all studies but one, repeating all steps as described previously, and
this model was subsequently validated in the remaining study.
This process was repeated for all combinations of trials.
We performed bootstrapping to correct for overfitting of the
final model. In each bootstrap sample, the entire modeling pro-
cess was repeated. A shrinkage factor was estimated from the
bootstrap procedure, and regression coefficients were shrunk to
provide improved predictions for future patients. We translated
the regression model into a score chart by dividing all regression
coefficients by the smallest coefficient and subsequently rounded
them to the nearest integer. The score chart is accompanied by
a table displaying estimated 3-year major bleeding risks. Patients
were divided into low, medium, and high risks according to their
score. We assessed both risk of bleeding and risk of recurrent
ischemic events across the risk groups. We subsequently assessed
the performance of the developed model for prediction of intra-
cranial hemorrhages, in terms of discrimination and calibration.
Methods are described in more detail in the e-Methods section.
We performed 3 sensitivity analyses: one including only patients
with an ischemic stroke as index event, one in which we excluded pa-
tients who were randomized more than 3 months after their qualify-
ing event, and one in which we excluded patients with missing data.
External validation. We externally validated the developed
prediction model in the PERFORM trial, a randomized clinical
trial including 18,417 patients with a recent TIA or ischemic

 stroke from arterial origin, who were randomized to terutroban
or aspirin.22 Seven hundred seventy-three patients experienced
a major or life-threatening bleeding event during follow-up
(mean follow-up 28.3 months [SD 7.7]). Major or life-
threatening bleeding was defined as bleeding that was fatal,

required
hospital admission, transfusion, or surgery. We applied the
original regression equation and baseline survival function to
the data and calculated 3-year major bleeding probabilities for
each patient. Again, discrimination and calibration were as-
sessed by means of the c statistic, calibration plots, and the
D’Agostino and Nam test. Results are reported in accordance
with the TRIPOD statement.23 All statistical analyses were
performed using R version 3.2.0 and SAS.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. The trials were approved by the ethics committee or
institutional review board at each participating center, and all pa-
tients provided written informed consent.
RESULTS After exclusion of patients with a possible
cardioembolic origin of their stroke (n 5 1,829) and
patients randomized to placebo or dipyridamole alone
(n 5 3,082), 43,112 patients remained for the anal-
yses (figure e-1). Major bleeding occurred in 1,530
patients during 94,833 person-years of follow-up. Of
these, 155 (10%) were fatal and 273 (18%) were
intracranial (nonfatal) (table e-6). The mean observed
1-year risk of major bleeding was 1.9% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.7–2.0), and the observed 3-year
risk was 4.6% (95% CI 4.4–4.9). Table 1 shows the
baseline characteristics of patients included in the
development population.
The results of the multivariable Cox regression anal-
yses are presented in table 2. The following predictors of
major bleeding were identified: male sex, smoking, type
of antiplatelet agents, outcome on mRS $3, prior
stroke, high blood pressure (hypertension), lower
BMI, elderly, Asian ethnicity, and diabetes (S2TOP-
BLEED, i.e., male Sex, Smoking, Type of antiplatelet
agents, Outcome on mRS, Prior stroke, high Blood
pressure, Lower BMI, Elderly, Asian Ethnicity, and
Diabetes). History of heart failure was not included in
the final model because of varying definitions across
trials and conflicting results. We visually inspected log-
minus-log plots and detected no deviations from the
assumption of proportional hazards. Internal-external
cross-validation showed that model performance was
comparable across all trials, indicating little heterogene-
ity in predictor outcome associations and baseline risk
(table e-7, table e-8, and figure e-2). We therefore

 considered it appropriate to use all data, although apply-
ing stratified Cox regression analysis to account for the
hierarchical nature of the data.
We combined all identified predictors in 1 model.
After shrinkage, the model had a c statistic of 0.63
(95% CI 0.61–0.64). The calibration plot showed
good
correspondence
between
predicted
and
observed risks (figure 1A), and the Gronnesby and
Borgan test was not statistically significant (p 5
0.74), indicating good overall fit.
We translated regression coefficients into score charts
presented in table 3. The S2TOP-BLEED score chart
can be used in combination with figure 2 to obtain
approximate predictions for individual patients. Major
bleeding risk ranged from 2% in patients aged 45–54
years without additional risk factors to more than 10%
in patients aged 75–84 years with multiple risk factors.
A total of 23,678 patients were categorized as low risk
(0–10 points; 55%), 16,621 as medium risk (11–15
points; 38.5%), and 2,813 patients as high risk ($16
points; 6.5%). The observed risk of major bleeding
increased across risk groups, as did the risk of recurrent
ischemic events (table e-9). The original regression equa-
tion and baseline survival function are shown in table e-
10. All sensitivity analyses showed largely similar results
(table e-11). The S2TOP-BLEED model showed a c
statistic of 0.61 (0.58–0.64) when used to predict intra-
cranial hemorrhage risk. Calibration was adequate after
re-estimation of the baseline hazard (figure e-3).
Estimated 3-year risks of intracranial hemorrhage based

validation population are presented in table e-12. Pa-
tients in the validation cohort were slightly older
(mean age 67 years [SD 8]) and less often had a lacu-
nar stroke. The mean observed 3-year risk of major
bleeding was somewhat higher in the validation pop-
ulation (5.5% vs 4.6% in the development population).
The prediction model for major bleeding had a c statistic

 of 0.61 (0.59–0.63) and slightly underestimated major
bleeding risk in the validation data, as represented in the
calibration plot (figure 1B) and by a significant D’Ag-
ostino and Nam test (p , 0.001).
DISCUSSION We developed the S2TOP-BLEED
score to predict an individualized risk of major bleed-
ing after a TIA or ischemic stroke, based on readily
available characteristics. Age was identified as the
strongest predictor of major bleeding. Calibration
was accurate in the development data, but bleeding
risk was slightly underestimated in the external vali-
dation data. Discriminatory performance of the
model may be improved by identifying stronger pre-
dictors of major bleeding.
Previously, 2 models have been developed to pre-
dict intracranial hemorrhage in patients with a TIA or
ischemic stroke,24,25 and 1 additional model was
developed to predict major bleeding in patients with
or at risk of atherothrombosis7 (table e-13). Consider-
able overlap exists between predictors in these models
and those identified in our study, including age,
hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and antiplatelet
agents. Age contained most prognostic information
in our model, followed by type of the antiplatelet
agent and BMI. The increasing risk of bleeding with
higher age seems particularly important, given the
rising number of elderly patients with a TIA or ische-
mic stroke, with around 30% of strokes occurring in
patients older than 80 years.26

To calculate the S2TOP-BLEED score for an individual, the
number of points associated with each indicator, apart
from age, should be added up. The corresponding 3-year
risk of major bleeding can be read from figure 2 for the
appropriate age group.

 characteristics appears to be difficult, as is shown by
the low c statistic of our model and other bleeding
models in patients with stroke. Similar results are also
seen for major bleeding scores in other domains, such
as the HAS-BLED and HEMORR2HAGES scores
for patients with atrial fibrillation.27,28 In most vali-
dation studies, c statistics of these models did not
exceed 0.65.29–31 Prediction of bleeding might be dif-
ficult because major bleeding consists of various types
of bleedings with different underlying pathophysio-
logic mechanisms and risk factor profiles. The dis-
criminatory performance of the S2TOP-BLEED
score slightly dropped when applied to predict intra-
cranial hemorrhage, possibly due to differences in risk
factors for major and intracranial bleeding, or differ-
ences in the strength of the associations between pre-
dictors and outcome. Lacunar stroke subtype is
reported to be a risk factor for intracerebral hemor-
rhage,24,32 but was not identified in the current study,
possibly because most major bleedings were gastroin-
testinal, which may have masked the association.
Alternatively, prediction of major bleeding might be
difficult because occurrence of bleeding may be
a more random process without clear precursors. Dis-
crimination of the current model might be improved
by incorporating other, potentially stronger predic-
tors, such as renal failure, history of bleeding (major
and minor), ibuprofen or paracetamol use, and results
from neuroimaging (e.g., microbleeds).
Although calibration of our model was excellent
in the development data, major bleeding risk was
slightly underestimated in the external validation.
The discrepancy between the observed and pre-
dicted risks is likely due to difference in the overall
observed risk between the development and valida-
tion population (3-year risk 4.6% vs 5.5%), leading
to a systematic underestimation. Given the large
number of patients included in our development
data and consistent performance in the internal-
external cross-validation procedure, we chose not
to adjust our model.
Although the current model may help to identify
patients at high risk of major bleeding events, it does
not aim to guide treatment choices for antiplatelet
agents, as the risk of bleeding should always be bal-
anced against the risk of recurrent ischemic events.
However, the current analyses show considerable
overlap in risk factors for bleeding and recurrent
ischemic events, as well as increasing risks of ischemic
events along with rising bleeding risks. The correla-
tion between the 2 risks suggests that it may be diffi-
cult to individualize treatment decisions based on this
balance. However, decision analytical studies are
needed to assess whether the bleeding risk may out-
weigh the risk of recurrent ischemic events in a specific
subgroup of patients.
An important strength of our study is the large
sample size, which enabled us to study a broad range
of prognostic factors without the risk of overfitting.
Second, quality of the trial data was high, with accu-
rate follow-up and few missing data. Third, patients
were included from all continents and had varying
ethnic backgrounds, which enhances generalizability
of the results. Fourth, although inclusion criteria var-
ied across trials, internal-external cross-validation
showed adequate performance in all trials, and sensi-
tivity analyses showed comparable results, which en-
dorses the robustness of the model. Fifth, we
externally validated our model in an independent
population and found similar discriminatory power
and slight underestimation that could be explained
by differences in the incidence of major bleeding.
Several limitations of our study need to be ad-
dressed. First, we developed our prediction model
in a population of trial participants. Because of appli-
cation of strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, trial
participants may not be representative of the entire
stroke population. Because patients at highest risk
of bleeding have been excluded (e.g., those with a his-
tory of bleeding), our model may underestimate
bleeding risk. Validation of the current model in
observational data would therefore be valuable. Sec-
ond, the trials included in our IPD meta-analysis
are relatively old, and diagnosis and treatment of pa-
tients with stroke has improved ever since. The lack of
MRI in the older trials will likely have led to some
misclassification of stroke subtypes, but may not have
had a large influence on the classification of strokes as
either cardioembolic or noncardioembolic, which was
an important distinction for our study population.
Third, we could only study candidate predictors that
were measured in the majority of trials. As a result, we
were unable to study some potentially relevant predic-
tors, such as renal failure and blood pressure. How-
ever, we were able to include hypertension as
predictor in our model. Fourth, the definition of
major bleeding varied slightly across trials. Unfortu-
nately, we were unable to reclassify major bleeding
events according to a standardized definition with
the available data. Also, we could not assign weights
to different types of bleedings, while the severity
and impact of included major bleedings clearly dif-
fers. Fifth, some candidate predictors were missing
systematically and were imputed with multiple im-
putations. Although imputation is increasingly rec-
ognized as a valid approach for handling of
missing data, imputation of systematically missing
data is relatively new, and methods for dealing with
systematically missing data are topic of further
study. Nevertheless, the hazard ratios remained
comparable after exclusion of those patients with
missing data.

 We developed and externally validated a practical
score that can generate individualized risk predictions
of major bleeding after a TIA or ischemic stroke.
Whether this model can guide treatment decisions
needs to be investigated in a decision analytical study
in which the risk of major bleeding is balanced against
the risk of recurrent ischemic events.
