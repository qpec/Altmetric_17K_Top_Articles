IMPORTANCE Use of locum tenens physicians has increased in the United States, but
information about their quality and costs of care is lacking.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate quality and costs of care among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries
treated by locum tenens vs non–locum tenens physicians.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A random sample of Medicare fee-for-service
beneficiaries hospitalized during 2009-2014 was used to compare quality and costs of
hospital care delivered by locum tenens and non–locum tenens internal medicine physicians.
EXPOSURES Treatment by locum tenens general internal medicine physicians.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Secondary
outcomes included inpatient Medicare Part B spending, length of stay, and 30-day
readmissions. Differences between locum tenens and non–locum tenens physicians were
estimated using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for beneficiary clinical and
demographic characteristics and hospital fixed effects, which enabled comparisons of clinical
outcomes between physicians practicing within the same hospital. In prespecified subgroup
analyses, outcomes were reevaluated among hospitals with different levels of intensity of
locum tenens physician use.
RESULTS Of 1 818 873 Medicare admissions treated by general internists, 38 475 (2.1%)
received care from a locum tenens physician; 9.3% (4123/44 520) of general internists were
temporarily covered by a locum tenens physician at some point. Differences in patient
characteristics, demographics, comorbidities, and reason for admission between
locum tenens and non–locum tenens physicians were not clinically relevant. Treatment
by locum tenens physicians, compared with treatment by non–locum tenens physicians
(n = 44 520 physicians), was not associated with a significant difference in 30-day mortality
(8.83% vs 8.70%; adjusted difference, 0.14%; 95% CI, −0.18% to 0.45%). Patients treated
by locum tenens physicians had significantly higher Part B spending ($1836 vs $1712;
adjusted difference, $124; 95% CI, $93 to $154), significantly longer mean length of stay
(5.64 days vs 5.21 days; adjusted difference, 0.43 days; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.52), and
significantly lower 30-day readmissions (22.80% vs 23.83%; adjusted difference, −1.00%;
95% CI −1.57% to −0.54%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries treated
by a general internist, there were no significant differences in overall 30-day mortality rates
among patients treated by locum tenens compared with non–locum tenens physicians.
Additional research may help determine hospital-level factors associated with the quality and
costs of care related to locum tenens physicians.

 T
heuseoflocumtenens,substitutephysicianswhocover
established clinical positions when full-time physi-
cians are temporarily unavailable, has increased sig-
nificantly in the United States between 2000 and 2015.1-3
Severalfactorshavespurredthisdemandforlocumtenensphy-
sicians, including local and regional physician shortages;
greater rates of employment by multispecialty group prac-
tices and hospitals, which have higher physician turnover than
smaller practices; and increasing demand for clinical services
among newly insured patients.1,2,4
At the same time, single, small group, and rural physician
practices depend on locum tenens physicians for coverage
during vacations and conferences.1,3,5 Demand for locum
tenens physicians has been highest in primary care, psychia-
try, and hospitalist medicine.1 Outside of the United States,
hospitals and practices in several countries, including the
United Kingdom and Australia, also rely heavily on locum
tenens physicians.1,6,7
Despite the importance of locum tenens physicians in
US health care, comprehensive national data on the quality
and costs of care of these physicians are lacking.3,6 Because
locum tenens physicians typically spend limited amounts of
time at any single institution, their relative unfamiliarity with
a hospital’
s systems (including electronic health records),
staff, hospital culture, and local postacute care options could,
among other reasons, predispose to worse patient outcomes
and increased costs of inpatient care.1,8-10 Therefore, national
data on Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized at acute care hos-
pitals during 2009-2014 and treated by a general internist
were used to evaluate the quality and costs of care provided
by locum tenens physicians.
Methods
This study was approved by the Harvard Medical School in-
stitutional review board, which waived participant consent.
Study Sample and Data Sources
This study included all acute care hospitalizations identified
in a random sample of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries
aged65yearsandolderduring2009-2014.For2011-2014,these
acute care hospitalizations were identified using the Medi-
care Provider Analysis and Review 20% files linked by ben-
eficiary identification to the 20% Medicare Carrier files. For
2009-2010, 5% random Medicare claims samples were used
because 20% Medicare files were not available. Hospital char-
acteristics were obtained from the 2011 American Hospital
Association Annual Survey.11
Identification of Locum Tenens Hospitalizations
The study sample included hospitalizations in which the
assigned attending physician was a general internal medi-
cine physician. Physicians were assigned to each hospital-
ization based on the physician’
s National Provider Identifier
(NPI) in the Carrier File that accounted for the plurality of
inpatient evaluation and management services during that
hospitalization.12 The study sample was restricted to hospi-
talizations in which the assigned physician had a designated
specialty of “internal medicine,” identified by NPI through
a comprehensive physician database with specialty infor-
mation obtained from multiple sources, including the
National Plan and Provider Enumeration System Registry,
the American Board of Medical Specialties, and state licens-
ing boards.13,14
Locum tenens hospitalizations were defined as those in
which a locum tenens physician provided the plurality of
evaluation and management visits. Locum tenens physi-
cians’evaluation and management claims were ascertained
using the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System
modifier code Q6,15 which identifies services furnished by
locum tenens physicians and is applied in the Carrier File to
the NPI of the regular physician for whom the locum tenens
physician is covering. Although the term locum tenens is
often used broadly to refer to any temporary physician hire,
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) regulations
specifically designate that the locum tenens modifier code
only be used when (1) the locum tenens physician is covering
an established clinical position that has been temporarily or
permanently vacated, (2) the locum tenens physician pro-
vides 60 days or more of coverage, and (3) the locum tenens
physician is not a member of the practice that is seeking
coverage.15 Therefore, according to the definition by CMS,
locum tenens physicians provide temporary coverage for
non–locum tenens physicians with established clinical posi-
tions. Physicians hired temporarily to fill new clinical posi-
tions (eg, to increase staffing during periods of excess sea-
sonal demand or to temporarily fill a new clinical position)
are not locum tenens.
Of note, the number of locum tenens physicians could
not be identified because Medicare data do not include the
NPI of the locum tenens physician, but rather the NPI of the
physician who was temporarily covered by a locum tenens
physician. Because a single locum tenens physician may tem-
porarily cover the care of multiple non–locum tenens physi-
cians, the data can therefore only provide information on
how many physicians are temporarily covered by a locum
tenens physician, rather than the number of locum tenens
physicians providing care.
Key Points
Question Are there systematic differences in the quality of
inpatient care provided by locum tenens vs non–locum tenens
internal medicine physicians?
Findings In this retrospective cohort analysis of 1 818 873
Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized between 2009 and 2014,
there was no significant difference in 30-day mortality
among patients treated by locum tenens physicians compared
with those treated by non–locum tenens physicians (8.83% vs
8.70%).
Meaning Among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries, treatment
by locum tenens physicians overall was not associated with excess
mortality risk.

 Study Outcomes and Covariates
We compared quality and costs of care during hospitaliza-
tions involving locum tenens vs non–locum tenens physi-
cians. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality (death
within 30 days of admission); secondary outcomes included
inpatient costs of care, 30-day readmission rates, and length
of stay. Costs were defined as total Medicare Part B spending
per hospitalization because Part B spending encompasses
professional and other services at a physician’
s discretion
and is therefore a proxy for inpatient resource use.12
Covariates included patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, Med-
icaid eligibility status (“dual eligibility”), and patient-level
Elixhauser comorbidity indicators for 31 conditions.16 Race
and ethnicity were defined using standard fixed categories
available in Medicare claims and originally provided to Medi-
care by the US Social Security Administration; these data
were included because they are associated with care quality
and spending, and therefore, they are important potential
confounders.17,18 The reported diagnosis-related group (DRG)
was used to assign each admission into 1 of 25 mutually
exclusive major diagnostic categories. Indicator variables for
admission month were included to control for seasonal dif-
ferences in locum tenens physician use that could correlate
with outcomes. In addition, indicator variables for day of
week of admission were added to control for factors associ-
ated with day of admission—such as staffing patterns and
patient severity of illness—that might also correlate with out-
comes. Furthermore, hospital fixed effects (ie, hospital-
specific indicator variables) were included to account for hos-
pital characteristics—including unmeasured differences in
patient populations and systematic differences in care
quality—that remain stable over time.
Statistical Analysis
Characteristics of patients treated by locum tenens and non–
locum tenens physicians were compared. Tests for observ-
able differences in patient demographics and illness severity,
including preexisting chronic conditions and the full distri-
bution of admission diagnoses (DRGs) were performed. The
geographic distribution and structural characteristics of hos-
pitalswherelocumtenensphysicianspractice,includingvaria-
tions in locum tenens physician use across the 306 US hospi-
tal referral regions, which are regional markets for tertiary
care,19 were also described.
Ahospitalization-levelmultivariablelogisticregressionwas
estimated, modeling 30-day mortality as a function of whether
care was provided by a locum tenens physician (indicator vari-
able),patientcovariates,indicatorvariablesfordayoftheweek
andmonthofadmission,andhospitalfixedeffects.Identicalmul-
tivariablelinearregressionswereestimatedforMedicarePartB
spending and length of stay. Hospital fixed effects accounted
for the possibility that locum tenens physicians may dispro-
portionately practice in hospitals with systematically differ-
ent quality of care, and indicator variables for month of ad-
mission controlled for seasonal differences, which could
confound the analyses. This approach therefore compared dif-
ferences in outcomes between locum tenens and non–locum
tenens hospitalizations within the same hospital and month.
All models included robust variance estimators to
account for clustering of admissions within hospitals.20
Adjusted patient outcomes for locum tenens and non–locum
tenens physicians were calculated using the marginal stan-
dardization form of predictive margins.21 We also assessed
whether patient mortality was associated with locum tenens
care in prespecified subgroups defined by hospital size, hos-
pital profit status, and “locum intensity.
” Locum intensity was
defined as the percentage of hospitalizations involving a
locum tenens physician among hospitals with any locum use.
This measure was designed to assess whether a hospital’
s
degree of experience with locum tenens physicians modified
the association between treatment by a locum tenens physi-
cian and mortality. In each subgroup analysis, a formal test of
interaction was conducted on the basis of standard errors
of the regression coefficient on the interaction term between
the locum tenens indicator variable and indicator variables
for a given subgroup.
Additional Analyses
An analysis was performed to assess for unobservable, sys-
tematic differences in case mix between locum tenens and
non–locum tenens physicians. Some primary care physicians
care for their primary care patients when they are hospital-
ized. If primary care physicians with sicker outpatient panels
are more likely to use locum tenens physician coverage, then
hospitalized patients cared for by covering locum tenens
physicians could have a higher unobserved 30-day mortality
risk. To account for this potential confounder, the mortality
regression model was re-estimated using the NPI of the phy-
sician covered by the locum tenens physician to control for
physician-level, rather than hospital-level, fixed effects. In
this way, time-invariant characteristics of physicians covered
by locum tenens physicians, including differences in outpa-
tient case mix, were accounted for.
A trend analysis was also performed to evaluate for
changes in the relationship between locum tenens physi-
cian care and patient 30-day mortality between 2009 and
2014. This analysis was performed for all patients in the
study cohort and among patients treated at hospitals with
high, medium, and low intensity of locum tenens physi-
cian use. For each group, the locum tenens indicator variable
was interacted with year indicators, which allowed for the
association between locum tenens care and a given outcome
to vary nonmonotonically by year. All analyses were per-
formed in R (version 3.2; R Foundation) and Stata (version 14;
StataCorp). The 95% CIs around reported estimates reflect
0.025 in each tail or P ≤ .05.
Results
The study sample included 1 708 398 non–locum tenens hos-
pitalizations and 38 475 locum tenens hospitalizations (2.1%
of hospitalizations) at 1590 hospitals. Approximately 9.3% of
non–locum tenens general internists in the study sample
(4123/44 520) were temporarily covered by a locum tenens
physician at some point.

 Intensity of locum tenens physician use varied substan-
tially across hospital referral regions, ranging from close to
zero percent of Medicare inpatient admissions in some hospi-
tal referral regions to more than 15% of admissions in others
(Figure 1). Compared with non–locum tenens physicians,
locum tenens physicians disproportionately practiced in the
South and West census regions, in smaller suburban and
rural hospitals (vs urban), and in public hospitals (Table 1).
No clinically relevant differences were observed in the
demographic and clinical characteristics of patients treated
by locum tenens and non–locum tenens physicians and sta-
tistically significant differences (including age and several
chronic conditions) were small in magnitude (Table 1). After
adjusting comparisons of patient characteristics for hospital
fixed effects (ie, assessing the balance of patient characteris-
tics within hospital), fewer significant differences between
patients treated by locum tenens and non–locum tenens phy-
sicians were observed (eTable 1 in Supplement). There were
no significant differences in the distributions of DRG diagno-
ses and modal admission DRG diagnoses between patients
cared for by locum tenens and non–locum tenens physicians
(Figure 2 and Figure 3).
Patient Outcomes
Unadjusted 30-day mortality was 9.01% (95% CI, 8.73%-
9.30%; 3501/38 475) for patients treated by locum tenens phy-
sicians vs 8.69% (95% CI, 8.64%-8.73%; 154 717 /1 780 398) for
patients treated by non–locum tenens physicians). There was
no significant difference in adjusted 30-day mortality be-
tween patients treated by locum tenens vs non–locum tenens
physicians (8.83% [95% CI, 8.52%-9.14%] vs 8.70% [95% CI,
8.69%-8.70%]; absolute adjusted difference, 0.14% [95% CI
−0.18% to 0.45%]) (Table 2).
Patients treated by locum tenens physicians had signifi-
cantly higher adjusted total Part B charges ($1836 [95% CI,
$1806-$1866] vs $1712 [95% CI, $1712-$1713]; absolute ad-
justed difference, $124 [95% CI, $93-$154]), longer lengths of
stay (adjusted mean length of stay, 5.64 days [95% CI, 5.55-
5.73] vs 5.21 days [95% CI, 5.21-5.21]; adjusted difference, 0.43
days [95% CI, 0.34-0.52]), and significantly lower readmis-
sion rates (22.80% [95% CI, 22.26%-23.28%] vs 23.83% [95%
CI, 23.82%-23.84%]; adjusted difference, −1.00% [95% CI,
−1.57% to −0.54%]) than patients treated by non–locum tenens
physicians (Table 2).
Subgroup Analysis
In prespecified subgroup analyses over the full study period
(2009-2014), adjusted 30-day mortality was significantly
higher among patients treated by locum tenens vs non–
locum tenens physicians at hospitals in the lowest tercile of
locum tenens intensity (11.63% [95% CI, 9.96%-13.30%] vs
8.53% [95% CI, 8.53%-8.53%]; absolute difference, 3.10%
[95% CI, 1.43%-4.77%]; adjusted odds ratio, 1.47 [95% CI,
1.22-1.77]; both P values <.001 for interactions of locum
tenens physicians with indicator variables for hospitals in
the middle and upper terciles of locum tenens intensity,
respectively, relative to hospitals in the lowest tercile of
locum tenens intensity) (Table 3). However, in year-by-year
analysis of patients admitted to hospitals in the lowest ter-
cile of locum tenens intensity, mortality differences
between patients treated by locum tenens vs non–locum
tenens physicians were largest during 2009-2012 (statisti-
cally significantly different from zero in 2011-2012 but not
significant in 2009-2010) and nonsignificant and close to
zero in magnitude during 2013-2014. Differences in annual
30-day mortality rates among all patients treated by locum
tenens vs non–locum tenens physicians, and among sub-
groups of patients treated at low, medium, and high locum
tenens intensity hospitals, did not vary by year in a trend
analysis (Table 4; eTable 2 in the Supplement). No effect

 modification was observed according to hospital size or for-
profit status (Table 3).
Additional Analyses
In analyses adjusted for physician fixed effects, patients
hospitalized during periods of locums tenens physician cov-
erage were not systematically unhealthier than patients hos-
pitalized during other periods, and care by locums tenens
physicians was not associated with a difference in 30-day
mortality (eTable 3 and eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized at acute
care hospitals and treated by a general internist, no signifi-
cant differences in 30-day mortality rates were observed
among patients treated by locum tenens vs non–locum
tenens physicians. Overall, patients treated by locum tenens
physicians had slightly higher Medicare Part B charges,
longer lengths of stay, and lower 30-day readmission rates
compared with patients within the same hospital who
were treated by non–locum tenens physicians. Most patients
treated by locum tenens physicians received care at small-
and medium-sized hospitals in rural and suburban regions.
To our knowledge, this is the first study using national data
to characterize locum tenens physicians’patterns, quality,
and costs of care.
A locum tenens physician is formally defined as a physi-
cian who provides temporary coverage for another physician
from a different practice or institution. In the United States,
the term locum tenens is often used to refer to all temporary
physicians (eg, physicians hired temporarily when clinical
volumes increase).3,22 The definition of a locum tenens by
CMS is consistent with the term’
s formal definition. Accord-
ingly, CMS restricts billing under the locum Q6 modifier to
care episodes that meet this definition.15,23 Thus, while Q6 is
likely to be highly specific for identifying traditional locum
tenens physicians, it will not capture other forms of services
delivered by temporary physicians who do not meet the
locum tenens definition of CMS.
While the CMS definition of locum tenens may not
be perfectly sensitive for all temporary physician ser-
vices, these findings may still have implications for care
quality and spending given the number of patients treated

and psychoses.

 by locum tenens physicians. In this study, 2.1% of Medicare
inpatients treated by general internists received care from a
locum tenens physician, as defined by CMS. Moreover, 9.3%
of physicians were temporarily covered by a locum tenens
physician during the study period. Furthermore, it is unclear
why temporary physicians who do not meet the traditional
locum tenens definition would have different mortality,
readmissions, or spending patterns than traditional locum
tenens physicians.
The lack of a significant overall difference in mortality
rates between patients treated by locum tenens and non–
locum tenens physicians is reassuring, and it argues against
the presence of systematic differences in the quality of care
administered by these 2 groups of physicians. The analysis of
year-by-year mortality among patients treated by locum
tenens vs non–locum tenens physicians did not reveal any
statistically significant differences in mortality rates between
these 2 patient populations. However, in 2009-2010, mortal-
ity rates among patients treated by locum tenens physicians
were nonsignificantly higher than those treated by non–
locum tenens physicians. Given the study’
s modest sample
size, a small statistically significant difference in mortality
during these earlier years cannot be ruled out. Even so, the
lack of suggestion of a mortality difference during 2011-2014
indicates that any small differences in care quality between
patients treated by locum tenens and non–locum tenens phy-
sicians, and any systematic problems in the use of locum
tenens physicians that could have predisposed to this differ-
ence in outcomes, in the early period of this study (2009-
2010) has resolved. It is also possible that the small nonsig-
nificant mortality differences observed in 2009-2010 reflect
confounding due to unmeasured variables associated with
the use of locum tenens physicians.
In subgroup analyses, treatment by a locum tenens phy-
sician was associated with significantly higher mortality
among patients admitted to hospitals that used locum
tenens physicians infrequently. It is plausible that hospitals
that use locum tenens physicians infrequently may lack
adequate support systems to help locum tenens physicians
transition into temporary clinical positions and minimize
any associated quality lapses, or hire less-skilled locum
tenens physicians. However, this subgroup result should be
considered to be hypothesis-generating given the retrospec-
tive nature of this study’
s design, the lack of a difference in
the primary mortality outcome in the overall sample, the
small sample sizes in the low-intensity tercile subgroup, and
the lack of evidence of a difference in mortality in the low-
intensity tercile in the most recent years 2013-2014.

 Several factors may predispose to higher spending and
longer length of stay among patients treated by locum tenens
physicians. Physicians may have little prior work experience
at the institutions that hire them for locum tenens positions.
A physician’
s clinical performance may be affected not only
by individual skill, overall experience, and organizational
performance, but also by institution-specific experience.24
Several facets of clinical care, including care protocols,
resource availability, and clinical norms, vary substantially
across health systems.8,10,25-27 Therefore, temporary physi-
cians, including locum tenens physicians, may initially
struggle to efficiently and effectively deliver care or coordi-
nate care transitions.28 In a survey of 259 managers of health
care facilities that use locum tenens physicians, among the
most commonly cited drawbacks to hiring temporary physi-
cian staff were lack of familiarity with the department or
practice (49%) and locum tenens physicians’need to learn to
use new equipment (32%).1 The longer lengths of stay and
higher Medicare Part B charges observed in this study among
patients treated by locum tenens physicians are potentially
consistent with this explanation. In addition, many hospitals
deliver inpatient care in multidisciplinary teams.9,29-31 While
high-functioning teams can improve clinical outcomes and
reduce spending, they take time to develop,32 and team
members’familiarity with one another is an important deter-
minant of team performance.9,33
Concerns have been raised abroad that locum tenens
physicians may have different clinical competencies than the
physicians whom they replace.3 In the United Kingdom in
the early 1990s, concerns about locum tenens physicians’
clinical competency resulted in the creation of a Working
Group on Locum Physicians and the development of compe-
tency standards and evaluation guidelines for locum tenens
physicians.22 In the United States, many locum tenens posi-
tions are filled through national physician staffing agencies,
which vet candidates before placing them.34 Although this
study found no evidence of a statistically significant overall
difference in mortality rates of patients treated by locum
tenens physicians, the United States lacks overarching com-
petency and quality standards for these physicians. Further-
more, because locum tenens physicians bill for clinical ser-
vices under the NPI of the physician whom they replace, no
mechanism currently exists for using administrative data to
serially evaluate individual locum tenens physicians’quality
and costs of care.
This study also found that receiving treatment from a
locum tenens physician was associated with lower 30-day
readmission rates. The discordance between this finding and
the lack of association between treatment by a locum tenens
physician and 30-day mortality is consistent with previous
work demonstrating that, across hospitals, differences in
30-day readmission rates do not correlate well with differ-
ences in 30-day mortality.35 Moreover, the only previous
study to evaluate physician-level 30-day mortality rates and
30-day readmissions rates found no relationship between
these 2 outcomes at the physician level.36 Furthermore,
this study’
s findings also suggest that, if locum tenens physi-
cians deliver more expensive inpatient care than non–locum
tenens physicians, this higher spending may be offset by
lower spending on 30-day readmissions.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the results should
be interpreted cautiously given the limitations inherent in

were adjusted for patient age, sex, race/ethnicity, month of year of admission,
day of week of admission, Medicaid eligibility, indicators for 31 Elixhauser

effects, with robust standard errors clustered at the hospital level. Trend tests
were performed to assess for trends in adjusted differences in mortality among

nonsignificant (using P < .10 as cutoff for statistical significance).

 of care that they deliver; and the quality and costs of outpa-
tient, pediatric, and surgical services delivered by locum
tenens physicians.4,37 CMS and private insurers could facili-
tate evaluations of physician-level variations in quality and
spending by requiring that locum tenens physicians submit
identifying information with the billing claim. Second, it is
possible that unmeasured patient confounders that correlate
with locum tenens care were not accounted for. Efforts to
account for unmeasured confounding included analyzing
outcomes of locum tenens and non–locum tenens physicians
within the same hospital, demonstrating similarities of
patient characteristics between the 2 groups of physicians,
and conducting sensitivity analyses. Third, no information
on locum tenens physicians’characteristics, including age,
training, and board certification, was available. Fourth, infor-
mation was lacking on how hospitals attempt to orient locum
tenens physicians to, and support, their clinical positions,
which may influence care quality. Fifth, this study evaluated
inpatient care delivered by general internists. The study’
s
findings may not generalize to other specialties or clinical
settings. Sixth, this study did not evaluate care delivered by
non–locums tenens temporary physician staff. Nonetheless,
factors that could account for differences in outcomes
between patients treated by locum tenens and non–locum
tenens physicians—including challenges delivering care
effectively in new health systems—may also deleteriously
affect care quality among other temporary physicians. If
non–locums tenens temporary physicians have similar out-
comes to locum tenens physicians evaluated in this study,
reclassifying them as locum tenens physicians could result in
a statistically significant overall difference in mortality
between locum tenens and non–locum tenens physicians.
However, the small nonsignificant difference in mortality
between patients treated by locum tenens and non–locum
tenens physicians observed in this study, and the narrow
confidence intervals around this estimate, suggest that if a
true difference in mortality exists, it is likely to be very small
in absolute terms. Seventh, because Medicare data do not
include specific identifiers for locum tenens physicians, our
study could not determine the number of physicians who
provide locum tenens care to Medicare beneficiaries.
Conclusions
Among hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries treated by a
general internist, there were no significant differences in
overall 30-day mortality rates among patients treated by
locum tenens compared with non–locum tenens physicians.
Additional research may help determine hospital-level fac-
tors associated with the quality and costs of care related to
locum tenens physicians.
