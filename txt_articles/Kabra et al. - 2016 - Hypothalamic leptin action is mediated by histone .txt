Hypothalamic leptin signalling has a key role in food intake and energy-balance control and is
often impaired in obese individuals. Here we identify histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) as a
regulator of leptin signalling and organismal energy balance. Global HDAC5 KO mice
have increased food intake and greater diet-induced obesity when fed high-fat diet.
Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of HDAC5 activity in the mediobasal hypothalamus
increases food intake and modulates pathways implicated in leptin signalling. We show
HDAC5 directly regulates STAT3 localization and transcriptional activity via reciprocal
STAT3 deacetylation at Lys685 and phosphorylation at Tyr705. In vivo, leptin sensitivity
is
substantially
impaired
in
HDAC5
loss-of-function
mice.
Hypothalamic
HDAC5
overexpression improves leptin action and partially protects against HFD-induced leptin
resistance and obesity. Overall, our data suggest that hypothalamic HDAC5 activity
is a regulator of leptin signalling that adapts food intake and body weight to our dietary
environment.

 O
ver the 20 years since leptin’s discovery, much has been
learned about its downstream targets in the central
nervous system and the complex regulatory network
controlling food intake, body weight and systemic metabolism1–7.
Diverse metabolic and genetic approaches have identified the
hypothalamus as the primary location for leptin-responsive
signalling cascades responsible for controlling energy homeo-
stasis, particularly acting through the melanocortin system3,8–13.
Centrally
projecting
neurons
such
as
proopiomelanocortin
(POMC) or Agouti-related protein (AGRP) neurons within the
hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) are primary leptin targets
and stimulate or inhibit second-order neurons via GABAergic
and glutamatergic projections to numerous brain areas and
hypothalamic nuclei, respectively14,15. POMC neurons also
secrete several bioactive peptide fragments cleaved from POMC
including aMSH, which activates MC receptors 3 and 4
(MC3r/MC4r) to elicit hypophagia1,3. Agouti-related protein
(AGRP) neurons within the ARC secrete AGRP, which directly
competes with aMSH as an inverse MC3r/MC4r agonist to
promote hyperphagia.
The failure to activate leptin signalling in AGRP- and POMC
neurons is a key feature of ‘leptin resistance’ and represents a
pivotal event in the development of diet-induced obesity and its
comorbid sequelae8,9,11–13. Leptin resistance may be in part a
heritable trait, but even siblings often display large variations in
the propensity to develop leptin resistance despite similar genetics
and a comparable socioeconomic environment16–18. Exactly how
gene-environment
interactions
predispose
an
organism
to
aberrant leptin signalling remains elusive. We here pursued the
hypothesis that deleterious post-translational modifications of
leptin signalling components occur in response to diets and
predispose to obesity.
A key mechanism to modulate gene–environment interactions
is the acetylation of lysine residues in histone and non-histone
proteins, tightly controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs)
and histone deacyetylases (HDACs). HDAC class III family
members such as SIRT1 or SIRT3 are well known regulators of
energy and glucose metabolism16. Class IIa family members
HDAC 4, 5, 7 and 9 excert partially redundant activity in
hepatic glucose control17, adipogenesis and adipose tissue
(dys)function19–21 and muscle differentiation22. Class IIa family
members were further shown to be expressed in hypothalamic
AGRP and POMC neurons23,24, but a central function in
metabolic control and leptin signalling has not been established.
We here aimed to assess whether class IIa family member
HDAC5 plays a role in the central control of metabolic
homeostasis and leptin signalling. Our specific interest in HDAC5
was triggered by the following observations. HDAC5 expression
is relatively restricted, with highest expression observed in
muscle,
heart
and
brain25,26.
HDAC5
is
expressed
in
POMC and AGRP neurons and regulated by the dietary
environment23,24, and HDAC5 is shown to be the central
epigenetic integrator of an animal’s adaptive response to short-
term and long-term emotional stress26. We here report that
HDAC5-mediated deacetylation of STAT3 is an important
regulator of hypothalamic leptin signalling and appropriate
central nervous system (CNS) control of energy homeostasis.
Results
HDAC5 expression is regulated by dietary lipids and leptin.
We first aimed to delineate whether the expression of epigenetic
regulator HDAC5 is affected by nutrient availability and the
metabolic state. Hypothalamic Hdac5 expression was reduced in
high-fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice when compared with
chow-fed lean controls (Fig. 1a). To determine the relevance of
HDAC5 for CNS leptin action, we assessed hypothalamic Hdac5
expression in leptin-deficient (Lepob) mice with and without
leptin replacement. Rescue of leptin deficiency normalized
hypothalamic Hdac5 expression, which indicates that the state of
leptin sensitivity directly affects hypothalamic Hdac5 gene
expression (Fig. 1b). The concomitant non-significant increase of
Hdac5 expression in saline-treated Lepob mice that were pair fed
to leptin-treated Lepob mice (Fig. 1b) prompted us to assess a
direct impact of dietary nutrients on hypothalamic Hdac5 gene
expression. Mice subjected to prolonged fasting revealed a

 decrease in Hdac5 gene expression and an increase after acute
refeeding with high-fat diet (HFD; Fig. 1c). Because refeeding
with fat-free diet did not elevate hypothalamic Hdac5 messenger
RNA (mRNA) expression, the data suggest that dietary lipids are
important for the regulation of HDAC5 in the CNS (Fig. 1c).
HFD-induced obesity did not affect hypothalamic expression
levels of HDAC class IIa family members Hdac4 and 9
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). CNS leptin action but not pair-feeding
induced the expression of hypothalamic Hdac4 but not Hdac9
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Hypothalamic Hdac4 and 9 mRNA
levels were increased slightly with short-term food deprivation
but decreased after prolonged fasting. Refeeding with fat-free diet
and HFD decreased hypothalamic Hdac4 mRNA levels. In
contrast, hypothalamic Hdac9 levels were slightly increased with
refeeding of HFD, and Hdac7 mRNA levels remained unaffected
by changes in nutrient availability (Supplementary Fig. 1c).
Overall, Hdac5 emerged as the most consistent nutrient-
responsive member
of the HDAC IIa family within
the
hypothalamus.
We next used the hypothalamic cell line CLU177 and primary
hypothalamic neurons to delineate the impact of direct leptin
action from nutrient availability on HDAC5 expression. Leptin
treatment significantly increased HDAC5 protein levels in
CLU177 cells treated with 1 mg ml � 1 (Fig. 1d,e) and hypotha-
lamic primary neuron with 100 ng ml � 1 leptin (Fig. 1f,g) for 24 h.
The increase in HDAC5 levels was paralleled by a 1.4-fold
increase in phosphorylation of the known leptin target STAT3 in
CLU177 cells and primary neurons, respectively. In summary,
hypothalamic
Hdac5
expression
selectively
and
specifically
responds to leptin signalling, to the availability of dietary lipids,
and, possibly, body adiposity.
HDAC5 ablation enhances responsiveness to HFD. Both male
and female global HDAC5 knock-out (KO) mice displayed
greater body weight gain than wild-type (WT) littermates when
fed HFD for 15 weeks (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Fig. 2a, body
weights at weeks 0 and 15 of HFD exposure: male KO
26.31±1.07 g to 47.78±1.60 g; female KO 22.78±1.03 to
43.62±2.10 g; male WT 29.27±0.90 g to 47.39±2.89 g; and
female WT 23.01±0.66 g to 35.58±2.36 g), further suggesting a
role of HDAC5 in the CNS response to dietary lipids. There were
no body weight differences when the mice consumed chow diet
for 15 weeks (Fig. 2a Supplementary Fig. 2a, body weights at
weeks 0 and 15 of HFD exposure: male KO mice: 26.87±1.13 g to
33.23±1.24 g; female KO mice: 20.80±0.53 g to 23.25±0.65 g;
male WT mice: 28.44±0.49 g to 34.41±1.41 g; female WT mice:
20.88±0.87 g to 24.37±1.20 g). The additional body-weight gain
of HDAC5-deficient mice on HFD was a consequence of
increased fat mass in both sexes, and was also apparent in male
chow-fed HDAC5 KO mice when compared with WT controls
(male mice: Fig. 2b; female mice: Supplementary Fig. 2b), likely
reflecting the lower, but still considerable, fat content of the
standard chow diet. Male HFD-fed HDAC5 KO mice displayed
larger epididymal white adipose tissue and combined inter-
scapular fat pads consisting of white and brown adipose tissue
(BAT; Supplementary Fig. 2c), as well as increased liver
weight (Supplementary Table 1) and liver triglyceride levels
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). Nasoanal length (data not shown) and
lean mass (male mice: Fig. 2c; female mice: Supplementary
Fig. 2e) did not differ between genotypes. Plasma leptin levels
were approximately eightfold higher in male HFD-fed HDAC KO
and approximately twofold higher in female HFD-fed HDAC KO
mice compared with HFD-fed WT controls (male mice: Fig. 2d;
female
mice:
Supplementary
Fig.
2f).
HDAC5
KO
mice
consuming HFD also had elevated fasting plasma cholesterol,
triglycerides and non-esterified free fatty acids compared with
WT littermates, whereas these biochemical parameters did not
differ between genotypes fed the chow diet (Fig. 2e–g).
A previous report suggested that virally mediated knockdown
of HDAC class IIa family members 4, 5 and 7 in the liver
improves systemic glucose homeostasis in mice17. We aimed to
assess the impact of global HDAC5 ablation on glucose
homeostasis in male and female mice exposed to chow or HFD.
In both genotypes, HFD exposure but not chow feeding, resulted
in increased fasting plasma insulin levels, with a trend towards
higher insulin levels in HFD-fed HDAC5 KO mice, compared
with HFD-fed WT controls (male mice, P ¼ 0.054, two-tailed t-

mice: Fig. 2i) or 15 weeks (female mice: Supplementary Fig. 3b;
male mice: Supplementary Fig. 3c) incurred comparable glucose
intolerance in both WT and HDAC5 KO mice. Insulin tolerance
did not differ between male HDAC5 KO mice and WT
littermates after 8 weeks chow or HFD feeding (Fig. 2j). The
hepatic expression of gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pc) was
similar in WT and HDAC5 KO mice exposed to 10 weeks of HFD
(Supplementary Fig. 3d). Notably, HFD-fed HDAC5 KO mice
displayed increased glucokinase (Gck1) and fibroblast growth
factor 21 (Fgf21) expression, and enhanced expression of
lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase (Fasn) or acetyl-
CoA carboxylase 1 and 2 (Acc1; Acc2) (Supplementary Fig. 3d).
Collectively, our data do not support a systemic glucoregulatory
role of HDAC5. Rather, our results indicate that HDAC5 has a
specific and important role in the molecular processes leading to
HFD-induced obesity and associated hyperleptinemia.
Hyperphagia drives obesity in HDAC5 KO mice. Our finding of
significantly higher feed efficiency (Fig. 3a) in male HDAC5 KO
mice chronically consuming HFD prompted us to delineate
whether HDAC5 ablation is causally linked with hyperphagia or
dysfunctional energy expenditure. Compared with WT controls,
male HDAC5 KO mice acutely exposed to HFD for one week
displayed increased food intake (Fig. 3b) and energy expenditure
(Fig. 3c; Supplementary Fig. 3e). A correlation of energy expen-
diture with food intake suggested that HDAC5 KO mice expend
more calories to partially compensate for the increase in calorie
intake (Supplementary Fig. 3f). The increase in energy expendi-
ture was not due to hyperactivity, as revealed by comparable
locomotor activity between the two genotypes (Fig. 3d), or due to
BAT
activity,
as
revealed
by

BAT
weight
(Supplementary Table 1) and unchanged gene expression of
uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1), Ucp2, peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (Ppargc1a) and cell
death-inducing dffa-like effector A (Cidea), a BAT-specific reg-
ulator
of
UCP1
activity,
thermogenesis
and
lipolysis31
(Supplementary Fig. 3g). Moreover, fuel preference (nutrient
partitioning) was similar between genotypes (Fig. 3e). These
results suggest that food intake is a causative factor for the obese
phenotype
and
the
perturbed
compensatory
response
to
consuming HFD of HDAC5 KO mice, implicating the CNS,
and particularly the hypothalamus, rather than peripheral sites of
action for the role of HDAC5 in the control of energy
homeostasis.

 of food intake and suggest that leptin signalling may be involved
in this process.
HDAC5 disruption impairs POMC expression. HDAC5 was
widely expressed in the arcuate nucleus of mice. HDAC5
expression was found in 68.62% of all POMC–green fluorescent
protein (GFP)-carrying neurons (Fig. 4a), and in 83.80% of all
NPY–GFP
carrying
neurons
(Supplementary
Fig.
4a).
No
expression was found in non-neuronal astrocytes or microglia
(Supplementary Fig. 4b,c). Importantly, acute pharmacological
inhibition as well as chronic lentiviral knockdown of hypotha-
lamic HDAC5 in adult rats or mice had no effect on Agrp
expression but consistently suppressed Pomc gene expression
(Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. 4d). In hypothalamic CLU177 cells,
POMC protein levels were decreased by the selective HDAC class
IIa inhibitor MC1568 (Fig. 4c,d). Moreover, compared with what
occurred in HFD-fed WT littermates, HFD-fed HDAC5 KO mice
had decreased Pomc mRNA expression in microdissected ARCs
(Supplementary Fig. 4e). We confirmed equal numbers of
hypothalamic POMC neurons in adult chow fed (Supplementary
Fig. 4f) and HFD fed (Fig. 4e) WT and HDAC5 KO mice, which
excludes developmental loss of hypothalamic neurons following
germ-line ablation of HDAC5 as the explanation for the repressed
POMC expression observed.
HDAC5 controls leptin signalling via STAT3 deacetylation. We
next determined whether genetic manipulation of HDAC5 would
affect key components of leptin signalling. Loss of HDAC5
altered hypothalamic expression levels of many intermediates of
the canonical leptin-signalling pathway, with decreased mRNA
levels of Stat3, Pi3k, Ptp1b and Socs3 in chow-fed HDAC5 WT
and KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 4g), decreased LepR, Stat3,
Ptp1b, Socs3 and Pp2a mRNA levels in HFD-fed HDAC5 WT
and KO mice (Supplementary Fig. 4h), and decreased LepR, Stat3
and Ptp1b as well as increased protein phosphatase 2 (Pp2a)
mRNA levels in primary neurons from WT and KO mice
(Supplementary Fig. 4i).
Since STAT3 is a direct transcriptional activator of POMC
gene expression27–29, we assessed STAT3 protein levels, Tyr 705
phosphorylation and Lys 685 acetylation, respectively. Compared
with primary neuronal cultures from WT controls, primary
neuronal cultures isolated from HDAC5 KO mice had increased
Lys685
acetylation
(Ac-STAT3)
but
diminished
STAT3
phosphorylation
(p-STAT3)
at
baseline
and
after
leptin
stimulation (Fig. 4f), leading to a decreased p-STAT3/STAT3
and p-STAT3/Ac-STAT3 ratio (Fig. 4g). We corroborated
diminished STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 and increased
STAT3 acetylation at Lys685 in hypothalamic CLU177 cells with

in

protein
expression,
respectively
(Supplementary
Fig. 4k–m). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed
that HDAC5 directly interacts with STAT3, allowing for
deacetylation at its Lys685 (Fig. 4h).
CLU177 control cells with stable expression of scrambled
shRNA displayed a uniform distribution of Ac-STAT3K685 in the
cytosol and nucleus; in contrast, stable shRNA-mediated knock-
down of HDAC5 induced a redistribution of Ac-STAT3K685,
which was detected almost exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 4i–k).
Last, by using chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR in CLU177
cells with knockdown of HDAC5, we observed a strong trend
towards reduced binding of STAT3 to its cis-regulatory element
near the transcriptional start site of the Pomc promoter
(P ¼ 0.075, two-tailed t-test; Fig. 4l). These results collectively
identify HDAC5 as an essential component of the functional
leptin signalling cascade and suggest a potential mechanistic role
in fine-tuning STAT3 deacetylation and phosphorylation and its
cellular localization.
HDAC5 affects leptin action and body weight in vivo. Next, we
administered leptin (intraperitoneal (i.p.)) to WT and HDAC5
KO mice and measured food intake and STAT3 activation. Leptin
significantly decreased food intake in WT mice but had no effect
in KO mice (Fig. 5a), proving that HDAC5 is functionally
required for the hypophagic component of leptin action.
Consistent with this, leptin-induced STAT3 phosphorylation
was
markedly
blunted
in
HDAC5
KO
mice
(Fig.
5b).
Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with leptin for 9 days
decreased body weight in WT mice (Fig. 5c), but not in HDAC5
KO mice (Fig. 5d). The i.c.v. leptin also decreased food intake in
WT (Fig. 5e), but not in HDAC5 KO mice (Fig. 5f).
We
further
assessed
whether
blunted
leptin
action
on
food intake is a consequence of dysfunctional melanocortin
signalling. Daily i.p. treatment of male chow-fed WT and HDAC5
KO mice with melanocortin receptor 3 and 4 (MCR3/MCR4)
agonist MT-II induced a comparable decrease in body weight
in both chow-fed WT and HDAC5 KO mice (Fig. 5g).
Intracerebroventricular infusion of the MCR3/MCR4 antago-
nist/inverse agonist SHU9119 increased food intake in both
genotypes (Fig. 5h,i), confirming that melanocortin signalling at
the level or downstream of MC3r/MC4r remains intact in
HDAC5 KO mice.
HDAC5 overexpression improves diet-induced obesity. When
administered leptin, chow-fed male C57BL/6J mice with AAV-
mediated overexpression of GFP in the MBH had a small
decrease in food intake after 8 and 12 h (Control AAV; Fig. 6a).

 In contrast, a substantially stronger and longer lasting leptin
action was observed in mice with HDAC5 overexpression
(HDAC5 AAV; Fig. 6b). To assess whether AAV-mediated
overexpression of HDAC5 in the MBH prevents leptin resistance
in mice fed a HFD, we exposed the same cohorts of AAV-treated
mice to HFD. Consistent with previous studies that reported
loss of leptin action after acute exposure to excess dietary
lipids2,5,8,11–13, 1 day of HFD exposure was sufficient to suppress
leptin (5 mg kg � 1, i.p.) action on food intake in control AAV
mice relative to saline (Fig. 6c). In contrast, mice with
AAV-mediated
hypothalamic
overexpression
of
HDAC5
retained a degree of leptin sensitivity, as evidenced by a
significantly
reduced
food
intake
24 h
after
leptin
administration compared with saline-treated HDAC5 AAV
mice (Fig. 6d). Moreover, leptin sensitivity in HDAC5 AAV
overexpressor mice was partially sustained even after 10 weeks of
HFD exposure, compared with leptin-resistant control AAV mice
(Fig. 6e,f).
Enhanced leptin sensitivity attenuated HFD-induced body
weight (Fig. 6g) and fat mass gain (Fig. 6h) in AAV–HDAC5
overexpressor mice compared with AAV controls. Lean mass
remained unchanged in both groups (Fig. 6i). When AAV-
mediated HDAC5 overexpression was induced in the MBH of
DIO mice that had consumed HFD for 6 months, there was a
partial rescue of the obese phenotype, as revealed by decreased
body weight (Fig. 6j), decreased fat mass (Fig. 6k) and unchanged
lean mass (Fig. 6l). Overall, these findings reveal an essential role
of hypothalamic HDAC5 for CNS leptin action in vivo, and point
to HDAC5 as a critical component of body weight control in a
lipid-rich environment.
Discussion
The present experiments demonstrate for the first time that
hypothalamic HDAC5 is an important component of leptin
signalling and the control of food intake and body weight.
Hypothalamic leptin action is of particular importance as a
functional unit regulating energy metabolism3. Leptin-responsive
circuitry in the hypothalamus originates primarily in the arcuate
nucleus, an area in close proximity to the median eminence,
which has a fenestrated blood–brain barrier allowing easy access
to
circulating
nutrients
and
peripheral
hormones.
Thus,
hypothalamic leptin circuitry is positioned to integrate multiple
stimuli to orchestrate an adaptive response to changes in the
environment. Leptin is secreted in direct proportion to adipose
tissue mass and activates leptin receptors (Lep-R) residing on
melanocortin circuitry, transmitting the overall metabolic status
and availability of energy stores. In obese individuals, leptin-
resistance blocks this feedback loop and leads to a chronically
positive energy balance and excessive fat storage8,11–13. How
environmental challenges such as HFD interfere with these
complex and sensitive endogenous circuits has been the subject of
intense research worldwide.

 We show here that HDAC5 activity is a component of
hypothalamic
leptin
action
and
essential
for
the
normal
physiological response
to a HFD. When challenged
with
exogenous supraphysiological levels of leptin, HDAC5 KO mice
are
leptin resistant,
while hypothalamic
overexpression of
HDAC5 increases leptin sensitivity. Moreover, there is reduced
HFD-induced leptin resistance in mice with hypothalamic
overexpression of HDAC5. Consequently, selective HDAC5
activation is a novel and promising approach to counteract
leptin resistance and obesity by targeting the primary interactions
between dietary challenges and the CNS control of metabolism.
The finding that HDAC5 has a role in the development of leptin
resistance is corroborated by a considerable series of findings
revealing impaired leptin signalling following loss of HDAC5
function. Leptin receptors located on hypothalamic POMC
neurons play a pivotal role in central leptin action39–42.
Importantly,
we
also
observed
that
mice
lacking
HDAC
function have a consistent decrease in hypothalamic gene
expression of Pomc, a peptide precursor that mediates leptin’s
anorexigenic effects. Genetic ablation of Pomc markedly increases
food intake and body weight in mice35,36,43, and mutations in
POMC induce severe early-onset obesity in humans38. Mice with
Pomc haploinsufficiency display significant increases in food
intake and body weight when exposed to a high-fat high-calorie
environment45–47. Consistent with the reduction in Pomc gene
expression, we found increased body adiposity and food intake in
HFD-fed HDAC5 KO mice, and partial protection from diet-
induced obesity in mice with hypothalamic overexpression of
HDAC5 relative to the appropriate controls. By counting the
number of POMC-expressing cells in the arcuate nucleus of
HFD-fed WT and KO mice, we could conclude that changes in
food intake and body weight in HDAC5 KO mice are not
mediated via a loss of POMC neurons3,35,36,38,43, but rather via
signalling cascades upstream of POMC. Our finding of a
normal physiological response of HDAC5 KO mice towards
pharmacological activation or inhibition of melanocortin receptor
3 and 4 signalling further suggests that leptin resistance could be
mediated at the level of the leptin receptor or via downstream
Jak/Stat3 and Pi3k gene expression in first-order neurons. In mice
with lentiviral knockdown of HDAC5 in the MBH, we observed
altered expression of Pi3k and Jak/Stat3, signalling molecules
mediating leptin effects on Pomc gene expression and food
intake27–29,33,44. Consistent with this, STAT3 phosphorylation
was induced in the arcuate nucleus of WT mice after leptin
administration, but blunted in leptin-treated HDAC5 KO mice.
STAT3 phosphorylation is a crucial event that directly links
STAT3 transcriptional activity with leptin action. Direct interac-
tions between HDAC5 and STAT3 and a potential role for
HDAC5-mediated STAT3 activation have not previously been
described. Consistent with our principal hypothesis, a single
report suggested STAT3-mediated recruitment of HDAC5 to the
Ptpn13 promoter30. We demonstrate here for the first time that
HDAC5 directly associates with STAT3. Importantly, we did not
use HDAC5 or STAT3 overexpression or protein tagging for co-
IP experiments, thus precluding false-positive artifacts. Direct
interaction of STAT3 has been reported for other HDAC family
members such as Sirt1 (refs 33,34,36) and HDACs 1, 2 and 3
(refs 34,37), but the overall impact of those HDAC–STAT3
interactions for the transcriptional activity of STAT3 remains
controversial. Initially, STAT3 acetylation at Lys685 by the
histone acetyltransferase p300 was considered critical for STAT3
dimerization
and
full
transcriptional
activity,
and
STAT3
deacetylation
by
HDACs
was
linked
with
decreased
transcriptional activity34,36,43. However, a positive role for
STAT3 acetylation stands in stark contrast to our results and
several other reports that collectively and compellingly imply
transcriptional repression by STAT3 acetylation. Specifically,
in our hypothalamic HDAC5 KD cell model STAT3 hyper-
acetylation at Lysine 685 concurred with hypophosphorylation at
Tyr705, decreased STAT3 binding to the Pomc promoter, and
decreased Pomc expression. Other reports found that STAT3
activity decreased in renal cells after pharmacological HDAC class
I inhibition37,44 and that knockdown of HDAC3 and subsequent
STAT3
Lys685
hyperacetylation
impaired
STAT3
Tyr705
phosphorylation and decreased overall cell survival in diffuse
large B-cell lymphoma43,48. Similar to our findings on STAT3,
STAT1 activation and translocation was very recently linked with
HDAC4-mediated deacetylation in podocytes44.
Exact mechanisms linking the interplay of STAT3 acetylation
with phosphorylation and transcriptional activity thus appear
complex, and may involve multilayered and tissue-specific
processes such as differential interaction partners and differential
(de)acetylation kinetics48,49. Site-directed mutagenesis of lysine
residue
685
to
an
inactive
arginine
had
no
effect
and
triple mutation of lysine residues 49, 87 and 685 only slightly
dampened leptin-induced STAT3 transcriptional activity50. The
enhancement of leptin sensitivity by the transcriptional regulator
Nur77
was
nevertheless
abolished
when
all
three
lysine
residues were inactivated, potentially via differential binding of
Nur77-STAT3 dimers to distant sites of the Pomc promoter50.
Acetylation of Lys685 was further shown to be critical for
gene
expression
driven
by
unphosphorylated
STAT3Tyr705
(U-STAT3Lys685) but not by STAT3 phosphorylated on Tyr-705
(pSTAT3Tyr705)51. In hypothalamic CLU177 cells with stable
knockdown of HDAC5, we observed a shift towards nuclear
translocation of acetylated STAT3Lys685 but diminished binding
of STAT3 to the Pomc promoter. HDAC5-mediated STAT3
deacetylation may thus control the availability of STAT3 within
the nucleus, and the transactivation of genes specific for either
pSTAT3Tyr705
or
U-STAT3Lys685.
Low
intrinsic
enzymatic
activity
of
HDAC5
may
further
require
interaction
with
another class I HDAC family member to catalyse STAT3
deacetylation.
For
hypothalamic
neurons,
we
nevertheless
conclude that direct HDAC5 action on STAT3—via reciprocal
STAT3
deacetylation
at
Lys685
and
phosphorylation
at
Tyr707—presents
a
critical
step
in
STAT3
transcriptional
activation and leptin signalling. Stat3 deacetylation—although
not a classical epigenetic phenomenon—thus represents an
important mechanism to convey environmental stimuli into the
temporal and spatial control of gene expression.
Previous reports linked hepatic HDAC class IIa family
members with the regulation of systemic glucose metabolism17,49.
Mihaylova et al.17 showed that the simultaneous liver-specific
knockdown of HDAC4, 5 and 7 in mouse models of diabetes type
2 could decrease gluconeogenic gene programs, increase hepatic
glycogen accumulation, and improve systemic hyperglycemia. In
primary murine hepatocytes, Wang et al.49 showed that the
concomitant depletion of HDAC4 and HDAC5 by RNA
interference could disrupt the glucagon-mediated induction of
gluconeogenic gene programs. Our data from global HDAC5 KO
mice do not support a specific and systemic role for HDAC5 in
glucose homeostasis. The discrepant findings might be explained
by redundant and compensatory action of class IIa family
members
4,
7
or
9,
which
seem
to
prevent
beneficial
glucoregulatory effects of HDAC5 disruption in our global
HDAC5 KO mouse model. Nevertheless, it should be noted that
adenoviral overexpression of non-phosphorylatable constitutively
nuclear HDAC5 in the liver modestly increased blood glucose in
chow-fed C57Bl6 mice17. It remains to be determined whether
global class IIa HDAC inhibitors can indeed confer beneficial
changes on hepatic glucose metabolism and whether the
obesogenic impact of global HDAC5 inhibition overrides any

 beneficial glucoregulatory effect of hepatic class IIa HDAC
inhibitors.
HDAC5
is
recognized
as
an
important
mediator
of
epigenetic changes via histone deacetylation and chromatin
remodelling25. Histone deacetylation occurs at various sites
within the histone proteins and can determine DNA packing
and chromatin accessibility. Thus, silencing of HDAC5 should
alter the ‘histone code’ and open up chromatin, allowing for
increased gene expression. HDAC overexpression should in turn
decrease gene expression by condensing chromatin. Using a
targeted approach, we were not able to identify upregulated
expression of leptin signalling genes in HDAC5 KO mice
compared with WT controls. Intriguingly, our data go beyond
the classical model of epigenetic HDAC action, at least with
respect to having a direct impact on leptin signalling. The
possibility that modification by HDAC5 may convey additional,
classically epigenetic, effects on the systemic control of metabolic
homeostasis and potentially even affect metabolic programming
of offspring, is a subject for future research. Ideally, such studies
should involve tissue-specific HDAC5 knock-out mice to further
delineate the mechanistic underpinnings of HDAC5 action.
In summary, our results identify the hypothalamic class IIa
family member HDAC5 as novel regulator of metabolic home-
ostasis and important component of leptin signalling. Hypotha-
lamic Hdac5 expression is regulated by nutrient availability and
leptin action, revealing a fully functional feedback loop at the
molecular interface that connects CNS control of metabolism
with dietary challenges. Genetic and pharmacological manipula-
tions of hypothalamic HDAC5 activity had profound effects on
food intake and body-weight control in our studies and overall
suggest a beneficial role for selected HDAC5 activation against
leptin resistance and obesity. Mechanistically, we document for
the first time a direct interaction of HDAC5 with STAT3,
suggesting a STAT3 acetyl-phospho switch regulated by HDAC5.
Such a switch may offer therapeutic opportunities with the
potential to fine-tune leptin signalling in direct response to
metabolic changes and environmental stimuli.
Methods
Animals. C57BL/6J mice, leptin-deficient (Lepob) mice, CX3CR1–GFP53,
GFAP–GFP52 and POMC–GFP mice41 were obtained from Janvier
(Le Genest-Saint-Isle, France) or Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Male
Wistar rats (260–290 g) were obtained from Harlan and fed chow diet througout
the experiment (Indianapolis, IN, USA). HDAC5 KO mice with excision of coding
exons 3 to 7 for a lacZ-neomycin resistance cassette54–56 were derived from
breeding of HDAC5 heterozygous mice with pure C57BL/6J background. Excision
of the Glutamine-rich N-terminal helical domain (exons 3–7, amino acids 69–156)
includes all HDAC5 transcript variants currently listed as NCBI reference
sequences, and suggests that HDAC5 functionality is completely ablated from our
KO model. Nevertheless, we cannot fully exclude the existence of truncated
HDAC5 transcript variants that lack the N-terminal domains. Mice with an age of
8 to 10 weeks were either maintained on chow (5.6% fat, LM-485, Harlan Teklad)
or switched to HFD (58% kcal fat; Research Diets Inc., New Brunswick, NJ, USA)
for a maximum of 16 weeks. To create DIO mice, young C57BL/6J mice were
exposed to HFD for 6 months. In vivo experiments were performed without
blinding of the investigators. All WT and KO mice used in our studies were
littermates. Mice and rats were group housed on a 12:12-h light-dark cycle at 22 �C
with free access to food and water, unless indicated otherwise. To assess the impact
of leptin on hypothalamic HDAC5 gene expression, 6-week old leptin-deficient
(Lepob) mice (71.12±0.71 g) were fed chow and treated once daily subcutaneously
for 6 days with either human recombinant leptin (1 mg kg � 1; R&D Systems;
N ¼ 6) or vehicle (PBS; N ¼ 6). An additional group of vehicle-treated Lepob mice
(N ¼ 6) was food restricted to receive daily only the amount of food eaten by the
leptin-treated mice (pair-fed to leptin). All studies were approved by and
performed according to the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of Cincinnati, USA, and the State of Bavaria,
Germany.
Body composition analysis and metabolic studies. Fat mass and lean mass
were measured via Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) technology (EchoMRI,
Houston, TX, USA). Energy expenditure, respiratory exchange ratio and locomotor
activity were analysed by a custom-made 32-cage calorimetry system (TSE Systems,
Bad Homburg, Germany)57. Before data collection, all mice were acclimatized to
the calorimetry system for 24 h.
Glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance tests. HDAC5 KO and WT littermates
were subjected to 6 h of fasting one hour after the onset of the light phase.
Subsequently, HFD-fed mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 g glucose per kg
body weight (20% wt/vol D-glucose in 0.9% wt/vol saline) for the glucose tolerance
test (GTT) and 1 U insulin per kg body weight (0.1 U ml � 1; Humolog Pen, Eli
Lilly, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for the ITT. Chow-fed mice received a glucose bolus
of 2 g glucose per kg body weight for the GTT. Tail blood glucose levels (mg dl � 1)
were measured with a handheld glucometer (TheraSense Freestyle) before (0 min)
and at 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after injection. One male chow-fed KO mouse
(Fig. 2i), two female chow-fed WT (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and one male chow-fed
WT mouse (Supplementary Fig. 3c) that did not display a predefined rise in blood
glucose from basal (r50 mg dl � 1) after a bolus injection of glucose were defined as
bad injection and excluded from further analysis.
HDAC5 knockdown studies. A set of GIPZ Lentiviral shRNA clones directed
against mouse HDAC5 (Open Biosystems Huntsville, AL, USA) was assessed by
western blot for optimum knockdown efficiency in the hypothalamic cell line
CLU177 (mHypoA-2/12; Cellutions Biosystem Inc., Toronto, Canada). Clone
V3LMM_432051 was selected for subsequent animal studies due to a knockdown
efficiency of 70%. Lentiviral particles for the HDAC5 shRNA (Open Biosystems,
Cat # VGM5520–200368831) and the appropriate non-silencing control (Open
Biosystems, Cat # RHS4348) were injected bilaterally into the MBH of C57BL/6J
mice (10 to 12-week old) (0.5 ml, 108 TU ml � 1) using a motorized stereotaxic
system from Neurostar (Tubingen, Germany). Stereotaxic coordinates were
� 1.5 mm posterior and � 0.3 mm lateral to bregma and � 5.8 mm ventral from
the dura. Surgeries were performed using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine
(100 and 7 mg kg � 1, respectively) as anaesthetic agents and Metamizol
(50 mg kg � 1, subcutaneous (s.c.)) followed by Meloxicam (1 mg kg � 1, three
consecutive days s.c.) for postoperative analgesia. Three days after the surgery, the
single-housed mice were switched to HFD and daily food intake and body weight
were recorded. A knockdown efficiency of 40 to 60% was measured by quantitative
(qPCR) from hypothalamic RNA two weeks and 10 weeks after lentivirus
administration, respectively.
Intracerebroventricular injections in rats. Male Wistar rats (260–290 g) were
implanted with a 22-gauge stainless-steel cannulas (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA,
USA) into the third cerebral ventricle as previously described2,57. Stereotaxic
coordinates were � 2.2 mm posterior to bregma with a depth of � 7.5 mm from
the dura. For the surgery, rats were anaesthetized by using a mixture of ketamine
and xylazine 86 and 12.9 mg kg � 1, respectively). Following all surgeries, the
single-housed animals received a single dose of buprenorphine (0.28 mg kg � 1, s.c.;
Buprenex; Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare, Hull, England). Correct placement of the
cannula was verified by i.c.v. administration of angiotensin II (1 mg ml � 1 of 0.9%
saline). Rats that failed to drink a minimum of 5 ml of water within 30 min were
removed. Food intake after i.c.v. injection of 4-Phenyl butyrate (Tocris, Ellisville,
MO, USA; 4PB; 30, 100 or 300 mg dissolved in 2 ml of 0.9% saline) or vehicle was
measured over a period of 4 h.
Adenoassociated virus (AAV) infusion in mice. Custom-made AAVs with full-
length murine HDAC5 complementary DNA (cDNA) under the control of a CMV
promoter or an AAV with CMV–GFP as control (AAV-CMV-HDAC5 versus
AAV–CMV–GFP; 2 � 109 viral genome particles per ml; Sirion Biotechnology,
Martinsried, Germany) were injected bilateraly into the mediobasal hypothalamus
of single-housed, lean 10- to 12-week old or DIO 6-month-old C57BL/6J mice
using a motorized stereotaxic system from Neurostar. Surgeries were performed
using a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 and 7 mg kg � 1, respectively) as
anaesthetic agents and Metamizol (50 mg kg � 1 s.c.) and Meloxicam (1 mg kg � 1,
s.c., for 3 days postoperatively) for analgaesia. Stereotaxic coordinates were
� 1.5 mm posterior and � 0.3 mm lateral to bregma, and � 5.8 mm ventral from
the dura. Fluorescence microscopy of frozen hypothalamus slices confirmed GFP
expression in a restricted area of the mediobasal hypothalamus (Supplementary
Fig. 5a). Overexpression of HDAC5 was confirmed by western blotting from whole
hypothalami; 2 weeks after AAV administration, HDAC5 protein levels were
increased 1.5-fold (Supplementary Fig. 5b,c). Notably, we did not observe any
compensatory increases in HDAC4 or HDAC3 protein expression in HDAC5 KO
or HDAC5-AAV-treated mice, but HDAC5 KO mice displayed a restoration of
Pomc expression to the levels of WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 5d,e). We corro-
borated HDAC5 overexpression by ipsilateral injections of HDAC5-overexpressing
AAV into the MBH of POMC–GFP mice, using the contralateral, uninjected side
as internal control (Supplementary Fig. 5f). Coexpression with HDAC5 was
observed in 63% of all POMC–GFP neurons on the contralatral side, which was
increased to 85% on the HDAC5-AAV injected ipsilateral side of the MBH
(Supplementary Fig. 5g). Densitometric analyses of fluorescence intensities
further revealed a 1.5-fold increase of HDAC5 protein levels on the ipsi- compared
with the contralateral side (Supplementary Fig. 5h).

 Leptin sensitivity assay. Groups of HDAC5 WT and KO mice were distributed
into treatment cohorts based on their starting body weight. We thereby aimed to
assure an equal distribution of starting body weights at the beginning of studies,
which allows for better dissection of longitudinal treatments effects on body weight
or food intake. Mice were fasted 3 h before the dark. Thirty minutes before dark
onset, mice were injected i.p. with 5 mg kg � 1 leptin (R & D system, Minneapolis,
MN, USA) or the PBS vehicle. At dark onset, all mice were allowed to eat, and food
intake was measured throughout the dark and subsequent light period. Leptin
sensitivity assays were carried out in 10- to 12-week-old HDAC5 KO and WT
littermates, in control and HDAC5-overexpressor mice on chow diet, and in
control and HDAC5-overexpressor mice after an acute HFD challenge of 1 day or
after 10 weeks of HFD exposure.
Chronic i.c.v. leptin and SHU9119 infusions in mice. HDAC5 KO and WT
litermates were anaesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100
and 7 mg kg � 1, respectively) and implanted with stainless-steel cannulas (Brain
infusion kit, Alzet Durect, CA) into the lateral cerebral ventricle. The cannulas were
connected via a polyvinyl tube to osmotic minipumps (model 10014D for mice;
Alzet Durect, CA) that contained either vehicle (PBS), leptin (1 mg per day) or
Shu 9119 (24 nmol per day, Cat. # ab141164, abcam, Cambridge, UK) and
placed subcutaneously into the interscapular space, as previously described56.
Stereotaxic coordinates were � 0.7 mm posterior, � 1.2 mm lateral to bregma and
� 2.5 mm relative to dura. Mice remained single-housed throughout the
experiment. SHU9119 infusions were conducted in 8-month-old mice, leptin
infusions were conducted in 10- to 12-week-old mice.
Melanotan 2 (MT2) intraperitoneal injections in mice. Age-matched and
single-housed HDAC5 WT and KO littermates (6-months old) were recorded for
body weight changes after receiving daily intraperitoneal injections of saline or
1 mg kg � 1 MTII (Cat # LKT-M1650, Enzo Life Sciences MN, USA,) for 3 days.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Mice were euthanized in CO2
and perfused with saline, followed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M
PBS (pH 7.4) cooled to 4 �C. Brains were removed and kept in fixative at 4 �C
for overnight post-fixation, then equilibrated for 48 h with 30% sucrose in 0.1 M
Tris-buffered saline (TBS; pH 7.2). Brains were cut coronally in a cryostat into
30-mm sections; sections used for immunohistochemistry were collected and rinsed
in 0.1 M TBS. For immunostaining, sections were sequentially pretreated with 1%
NaOH with 1% H2O2 solution, 0.3% glycine and 0.3% SDS, and blocked with
SUMI. Subsequently, sections were incubated overnight with primary antibody
anti-pSTAT3 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) or
POMC (1:1,000, Rabbit Anti-POMC Precursor (27–52) (Porcine) Antiserum
(Catalog No.:H-029-30) diluted in SUMI at 4 �C. After several TBS washes, sections
were incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody diluted in SUMI (1:400,
Vector Biolab, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Another round of TBS washes was followed
by amplification of the signal using the avidine-biotin conjugates, and subsequent
DAB-H2O2 staining for 10 min. Sections were washed with TBS, mounted on
gelatine-pre-coated glass slides, and kept for air drying. Dried sections were further
dehydrated by immersion in a series of alcohol (50–100%) followed by two
incubation steps with 100% xylene before being mounted with a coverslip using
mounting solution. Images were captured by a BZ-9000 microscope (Keyence
Corporation Itasca, IL, USA). For colocalization images, hypothalamic coronal
sections from POMC–GFP mice or C57Bl/6J mice were incubated with antibodies
directed at HDAC5 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000, Cat # 07–045, Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) or HDAC5 and GFAP (goat polyclonal 1:1,000, Cat # SAB2500462,
Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA), respectively. Subsequently, sections were
incubated with 594 Alexa anti-rabbit or 488 Alexa anti-goat secondary antibody,
and mounted on glass slides using antifade mounting media containing DAPI
(Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). Images were captured by either a
BZ-9000 microscope or a Leica TCS SP8 Microscope and the percentage of green
and red colocalized fluorescence in arcuate nucleus neurons was counted (3 slices
per mouse).
Immunocytochemistry. For immunocytochemistry, 5 � 104 wildtype and
knockdown CLU 177 cells were cultured in 4 well chamber slides (Lab-Tek II CC2)
for 24 h, then fixed with 4% PFA and processed for immunocytochemistry. In brief,
slides were washed with 3 times PBS and then incubated with blocking buffer
containing 5% goat serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 1 h at room temperature.
Subsequently, slides were incubated overnight at 4 �C with primary Ac-STAT3K685
antibody (Rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Cat #2523,Cell Signaling). The slides were
washed three times with PBS-T (0.01% Tween 80) and incubated with goat
anti-rabbit Alexa595 fluorescence antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h at room
temperature. Slides were washed three times with PBS-T and mounted with
ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI. Images were captured using a
Leica TCS SP8 Microscope and analysed using ImageJ software for nuclear and
cytoplasmic localization of Ac-STAT3.
Blood chemistry. Blood was collected in EDTA-containing centrifuge tubes and
centrifuged at 4 �C and 2,000g for 10 min to generate plasma. Plasma triglycerides,
cholesterol and non-esterified fatty acids were measured by commercial enzymatic
assay kits (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany). Insulin and leptin were measured
by ultrasensitive murine insulin and murine leptin ELISA kits (Crystal Chem,
Inc., Downers Grove, IL, USA). All assays were performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Hepatic triglyceride content measurement. Hepatic triglyceride content was
determined by using a triglyceride assay kit (Wako Chemicals, Neuss, Germany)
as described59.
Cell culture, transfection and western blotting. CLU177 hypothalamic cells
were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics (penicillin 100 IU ml � 1 and streptomycin 100 mg ml � 1) in 5% CO2
at 37 �C. At 70–80% confluence, cells were transfected with four different
mouse GIPZ lentiviral shRNA clones (V2LMM_76750, V3LMM_432047,
V3LMM_432050 and V3LMM_432051, (Open Biosystems Huntsville, AL, USA)
using lipofectamine (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) for 48 h and subjected to
western blotting for anti-HDAC5 (mouse monoclonal 1:2,000, Cat # sc-133106,
Santacruz, CA, USA) and anti-actin (1:10,000, Cat #4970, rabbit polyclonal, Cell
Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA), as previously described58. Subsequently, a stable
cell line was made from clone V3LMM_432051 and from the appropriate non-
silencing control using puromycine (10 mg ml � 1, Sigma) treatment for 14 days.
Cells were cultured in six-well plates until they reached 80–90% confluency,
followed by serum starvation for 5 h and treated with and without leptin for the
indicated period of time. Protein was extracted using RIPA buffer containing
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.,
Rockford, IL USA) 1 mM phenyl-methane-sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1 mM
sodium butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Proteins were transferred on
nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans Blot Turbo transfer apparatus (Biorad,
Hercules, CA, USA) and stained with either anti-HDAC5 (mouse monoclonal,
1:2,000, Cat # sc-133106, Santacruz, CA, USA), or anti-POMC (goat polyclonal,
1:2,000, Cat # ab32893, abcam) or anti-Ac-STAT3K685 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500,
Cat #2523,), anti-p-STAT3T705 (rabbit polyclonal, 1:500, Cat #9145), anti-STAT3
(mouse monoclonal, 1:2,000, Cat #9139), and anti-ACTIN (1:10,000, rabbit
polyclonal, Cat #4970) from Cell Signaling Technology. Detection was carried out
on a LiCor Odyssey instrument (Lincoln, NE, USA) or via conventional film
detection, using ECL or prime ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).
Original western blots are shown as Supplementary Figs 6–9, respectively.
Adenoviral delivery of HDAC5 was conducted in CLU177 cells that were first
transfected with overexpresser mouse STAT3 plasmid (OriGene, Rockville, MD,
USA) using lipofectamine. After 24 h of transfection, cells were incubated with
recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus expressing HDAC5–GFP or control
adenovirus. Cell culture media were changed after overnight incubation, and the
cells were allowed another 48 h to express the transduced gene before experiments
were performed.
Primary hypothalamic neuronal cell culture. Hypothalami were extracted from
Embryonic Day 14 (E14) mouse embryos. Cells were cultured separately according
to the genotype of parent donors (WT or HDAC5 KO) and dissociated to single
cells after digestion with trypsin, as previously described60,61. Neurons were plated
on 6-well plates coated with poly-L-Lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at a
density of 2,000 neurons per mm2, and were cultured in Neurobasal
(Life technologies) supplemented with B-27 and GlutaMAX I. After 7 days in
culture, glia cells were efficiently removed, and neurons started to develop synaptic
processes. Cells were collected with Neurobasal without any supplements. For
adenoviral deliveries of HDAC5, primary neurons at day 5 were incubated with
recombinant replication-deficient adenovirus expressing HDAC5–GFP or control
adenovirus. Cell culture media were changed after overnight incubation, and the
neurons were allowed another 48 h to express the transduced gene before
experiments were performed.
Laser-capture microdissection microscopy. Mice were killed in CO2 and
perfused with saline followed by a solution of 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PBS
(pH 7.4, 4 �C). Brains were removed and kept overnight in fixative at 4 �C, then
equilibrated for 48 h with 30% sucrose in 0.1 M TBS (pH 7.2). Brains were cut
coronally in a cryostat into 40-mm sections. Section were directly mounted on
polyethylene naphthalate membrane frame slides from applied biosystem and
stored at � 80 �C. In total, the arcuate nuclei of 16 hypothalamic slides per animal
were excised and collected by using a Leica laser capture microdissection micro-
scope. Microdissected tissues were processed for RNA isolation using the Arcturus
Paradise kit (Life technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). In brief, sections
were first treated with proteinase K followed by binding of RNA to the column,
DNA digestion, washing and finally elution of RNA in small amounts. RNA quality
and quantity were analysed by nanodrop. Equal amounts of RNA were translated
to cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) reverse
transcriptase. Gene expression was analysed using either taqman probes (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or custom-made primers (Sigma, St Louis, MO,

 USA) and the respective taqman or sybr green mastermixes (Applied Biosystems).
qPCRs were carried out using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). Gene expression was evaluated using the D-D Ct method with
HPRT/RPL32 as housekeeping genes.
RNA isolation, qPCR analysis. RNA was isolated from tissues using a commer-
cially available kit (RNeasy, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For qPCR analyses, equal
amounts of RNA were transcribed to cDNA using Superscript III (Invitrogen,
Darmstadt, Germany). Gene expression was analysed using either taqman probes
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) or custom-made primers (Sigma, St
Louis, MO, USA) and the respective taqman or sybr green mastermixes (Applied
Biosystems). qPCRs were carried out using a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System
(Applied Biosystems). Gene expression was evaluated using the D-D Ct method
and HPRT/RPL32 was used as housekeeping gene. Taqman probes (mouse) and
primer pairs (mouse, rat) used are indicated in the Supplementary Tables 2–4,
respectively.
Immunoprecipitation. CLU177 cells were lysed with NP40 lysis buffer (25 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% NP-40, 10 mM PMSF and 1 �
protease phosphatase inhibitor cocktail). Protein was estimated by the Piercet
BCA Protein Assay Kit. Cell lysates (500 mg) were diluted in lysis buffer and
incubated with 4 mg of anti-HDAC5 (mouse monoclonal, Cat # sc-133106, San-
tacruz, CA, USA). The immunoprecipitates were incubated overnight at 4 �C with
A/G magnetic beads (Invitrogen) and then washed three times with PBS containing
0.02% Tween 20. Samples were boiled in 3 � Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins
were resolved on a 4–20% SDS–PAGE gel, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes
(Bio-Rad), and detected with the appropriate antibodies by chemiluminescence.
CHIP assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described
before62,63. Briefly, CLU177 cells were washed with PBS, and incubated at room
temperature for 45 min with 2 mM DSG and for 10 min with 1% formaldehyde
before crosslinking of proteins was stopped by the addition of 0.1 M glycine. Cells
were first lysed in L1 buffer (50 mM Tris pH8, 2 mM EDTA pH8, 0.1% NP-40, 10%
Glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail 10 mM sodium butyrate) to isolate nuclei.
Nuclei were resuspended in L2 lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris
pH 8, protease inhibitor cocktail, 10 mM sodium butyrate) and sonicated with
Covaris E210 (Woburn, MA, USA) to generate fragments of genomic DNA ranging
from 200 to 1,000 bp in length. Immunoprecipitations with the indicated
antibodies or rabbit IgG (as control) were carried out overnight using Protein A/G
mix sepharose beads (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Immunoprecipitates
were washed, eluted, and then crosslinks reversed overnight at 65 �C in the
presence of 1 ml RNAseA (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Rockford,
IL USA) and 20 mg Proteinase K. The DNA fragments were recovered using
phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol (25:24:1) extraction followed by purification
using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and subjected to
RT–PCR, with primers directed against the POMC transcription start site (fwd
50-GTTCTTCCTAACCACCAGCG-30 and rev 50-GTCCCTGTCGCTCTTCTCTC-30).
Semiquantitative measurement of HDAC5 immunostaining. Analyses of
POMC HDAC5 colocalization and HDAC5 protein levels in POMC–GFP mice
with ipsilateral AAV-mediated overexpression of HDAC5 were performed by using
ImageJ v1.47 (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/user-guide.pdf). Images were
captured using a Leica TCS SP8 Microscope. Image intensities for HDAC5
(red fluorescence) were normalized to the non-injected contralateral side using
ImageJ thresholding, and the increase in HDAC5-positive POMC neurons on the
virus-injected ipsilateral side (POMC: green fluorescence; colocalization: yellow
overlay) was counted manually. HDAC5 protein levels were quantified by using
greyscale (8 bit) binary image conversion and thresholding followed by application
of the LookUp Table function (Image4Adjust4Threshold4Apply LUT).
Statistical analyses. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
Prism or SPSS. Two groups were compared by using two-tailed unpaired Student’s
t-test. Multiple comparision analyses were performed by using one- or two-way
analysis of variances followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests. Differences in energy
expenditure were assessed by analysis of covariances, with lean and fat mass as
covariates. P values o0.05 were considered significant. All results are presented as
means±s.e.m.
