ABSTRACT
Randomized controlled trials suggest that protein restriction may retard the progression of CKD toward
ESRD. However, the effects of dietary protein intake level and the food sources of dietary protein on the
risk of ESRD in the general population remain unclear. We investigated these effects in the Singapore
Chinese Health Study, a prospective population-based cohort that recruited 63,257 Chinese adults aged
45–74 years from 1993 to 1998. We collected habitual diet information via a validated semiquantitative
food frequency questionnaire and identified ESRD via record linkage with a nationwide registry. In all, 951
cases of ESRD occurred over a mean follow-up of 15.5 years. Regarding total protein intake, compared
with the lowest quartile, the three higher quartiles combined had a hazard ratio for ESRD of 1.24 (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 1.05 to 1.46), but the dose-dependent association across the quartiles was
not statistically significant (Ptrend=0.16). Red meat intake strongly associated with ESRD risk in a dose-
dependent manner (hazard ratio for highest quartile versus lowest quartile,1.40 [95% CI, 1.15 to 1.71;
Ptrend,0.001]). Intake of poultry, fish, eggs, or dairy products did not associate with risk of ESRD. In
substitution analysis, replacing one serving of red meat with other food sources of protein associated
with a maximum relative risk reduction of 62.4% (95% CI, 33.1 to 78.9; P,0.01). Our study shows that red
meat intake may increase the risk of ESRD in the general population and substituting alternative sources of
protein may reduce the incidence of ESRD.

ESRD is the final stage of CKD and is defined by the
need for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or
transplantation).1,2 The incidence and prevalence
of all stages of CKD, including ESRD, are rising
globally with nearly 500 million people estimated
to have CKD,3 posing significant stress on world-
wide public health systems.4 Evidence from animal
and human studies suggests that high protein in-
take, especially animal-sourced protein, may accel-
erate decline in GFR.5–7 There is also evidence from
randomized controlled trials that dietary protein
restriction may retard the progression of disease
among patients with advanced CKD.8–11 Current
guidelines recommend the restriction of dietary
protein intake as part of the management of
CKD.1,2,12 However, the evidence on the benefit
of dietary protein restriction, especially limiting
specific sources of protein intake, on the risk of
ESRD or decline in renal function in the general
population remains unclear.13–17
We therefore analyzed data from the Singapore
Chinese Health Study, a prospective cohort of Chi-
nese adults in Singapore, to examine the relationship

 between habitual dietary intakes of major food sources of
protein and incident ESRD. This population-based prospective
cohort was linked with the Singapore Renal Registry, which
maintains nationwide records of all patients with ESRD in
Singapore. We also sought to explore whether the increased risk
of ESRD with any particular food sources of protein, if present,
could be modified by replacing with other sources of dietary
protein using the method of substitution analyses previously
described.18,19 We hypothesized that risk of progression to in-
cident ESRD would be higher with habitual intake of red meat
compared with other food sources of proteins in the general
Chinese population.
RESULTS
After a mean follow-up of 15.5 (SD 4.3) years among 60,198
participants (932,646 person-years), there were 951 incident
ESRD cases. The mean age at ESRD diagnosis was 69.3 (SD 8.6;
range 47.6–92.6) years. The distributions of selected charac-
teristics among the quartiles of red meat intake are shown in
Table 1. Compared with the lowest quartile of red meat intake,
participants with highest quartile were slightly younger at re-
cruitment (55.7 years versus 56.5 years), more likely to be of
Hokkien descent, and less likely to be physically active (31%
versus 39% had at least 30 minutes of moderate activity, vig-
orous activity or strenuous sports per week). Participants who
had the highest quartile of red meat intake also had lower
prevalence of self-reported hypertension (22% versus 24%),
but had higher prevalence of self-reported diabetes mellitus
(9% versus 7%) at baseline compared with those in the lowest
quartile of red meat intake. We also noted that participants
who had the highest quartile of red meat intake also had sig-
nificantly higher total protein intake (65.3 versus 53.1 g/d),
but significantly lower intake of fruits (169.5 versus 232.8 g/d)
and vegetables (107.9 versus 113.8 g/d) compared with those
in the lowest quartile of red meat intake (Table 1). Interest-
ingly, it was noted that subjects who were in the second and
third quartiles of red meat intake were less educated (27% and
26%, respectively) and less likely to smoke (27% and 29%,
respectively) compared with their counterparts who were in
the lowest quartile (31% had secondary or higher education,
and 31% were ever smokers) or those in the highest quartile of
meat intake (30% had secondary or higher education, and
35% were ever smokers).
Total protein intake, which included protein from both
plant and animal sources, was positively associated with
incidence of ESRD in a model that adjusted for basic de-
mographic characteristics (i.e., age, gender, dialect, educa-
tional level, and year of interview), with a hazard ratio (HR)

 of 1.55 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.28 to 1.87;
Ptrend,0.001) when comparing the highest quartile with the
lowest quartile intake. However, the HR was attenuated to 1.19
(95% CI, 0.98 to 1.44) after adjusting for other lifestyle and
comorbidity factors. Compared with the lowest quartile, the
HR for the three higher quartiles combined was 1.24 (95% CI,
1.05 to 1.46), but the dose dependent association across the
quartiles was not statistically significant (Ptrend=0.16) after
adjusting for lifestyle and comorbidity factors (Table 2). We
also conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the relation-
ship between absolute protein intake per day and total protein
intake/body weight, and ESRD risk. For both variables, the
risk of ESRD increased with increasing quartile intake but
the risk estimates comparing the extreme quartiles and the
dose-dependent association across the quartiles did not reach
statistical significance (data not shown).
When analyzing the individual food sources of protein
intakes, we observed a strong, dose-dependent, positive
association with red meat, even after adjusting for lifestyle/
comorbidity risk factors of ESRD and other food sources of
protein: the HR comparing the extreme quartiles was 1.40
(95% CI, 1.15 to 1.71; Ptrend,0.001) for red meat intake (Table
3). When we adjusted further for total protein intake, the pos-
itive dose response relationship between red meat intake and
ESRD risk was maintained: the HR comparing the extreme
quartiles was 1.38 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.71; Ptrend,0.001), sug-
gesting that the increased risk associated with red meat intake
was not confounded by higher overall dietary protein intake.
Conversely, there was an inverse relationship between
consumption of soy food and legumes and risk of ESRD that
was ofborderline statisticalsignificance: theHRcomparing the
extreme quartiles was 0.83 (95% CI, 0.69 to 1.01; Ptrend=0.07)
in an overall adjusted model that included basic demographic
factors, lifestyle/comorbidity risk factors, and other food sour-
ces of protein. Figure 1 illustrates ESRD-free survival by quar-
tile intake of red meat. Although event rate was low, the
probability of ESRD-free survival was higher among those
with lower intake (quartiles 1 and 2) compared with those
with higher intake (quartiles 3 and 4) (log-rank P,0.001).
No significant association with risk of ESRD was observed
with the intake of poultry, fish and shellfish, eggs, and dairy
products (Table 3).
We repeated our analysis by including an additional 107
CKD deaths, which were not registered as ESRD cases in the
Singapore Renal Registry, with the 951 ESRD cases as a
composite outcome, and continued to observe a strong, dose-
dependent, positive association with red meat, but not with
other sources of protein (Table 4). Compared with the lowest
quartile, the HR for the three higher quartiles combined was
1.20 (95% CI, 1.00 to 1.43) for total protein intake and com-
pared with the lowest quartile, the HR for the fourth quartile
of red meat intake was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.17 to 1.71;
Ptrend,0.001). Finally, we repeated the analysis with 15,082
cases of total deaths and ESRD as a composite outcome, and
the dose-dependent, positive association with red meat re-
mained unchanged. Compared with the lowest quartile, the
HR for the highest quartile of red meat intake was 1.11 (95%
CI, 1.06 to 1.17; Ptrend,0.001).
A four-year lag sensitivity analysis with a total of 57,864
participants and 811 cases yielded similar results as the
complete dataset (Supplemental Table 1). The positive rela-
tions of total protein and red meat with ESRD incidence re-
mained largely unchanged. For example, the HR for the upper
three quartile intakes of total protein combined, compared
with the lowest quartile, was 1.49 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.78) in
the basic model and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.54) in the model
that adjusted for lifestyle and comorbidity risk factors of
ESRD. The strong dose-dependent association between red
meat intake and ESRD risk remained clear in the four-year
lag sensitivity analysis (Supplemental Table 2): the risk esti-
mates for quartile 2, quartile 3 and quartile 4 intakes were 1.06
(95% CI, 0.85 to 1.32), 1.36 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.70), and 1.49

all adjusted model. No significant associations could be found
for the other food sources of protein intake with risk of ESRD.
We conducted sensitivity analysis with 239 incident ESRD
cases arising from 42,039 participants without baseline history
of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, or stroke
(Supplemental Table 3). In this subpopulation, which in-
cluded only 25% of ESRD cases, there was no clear association
of ESRD risk with total protein intake (HR, 1.28 [95% CI, 0.87
to 1.90; Ptrend=0.26]) when comparing the two extreme quar-
tiles, although the risk was still higher in the upper three quar-
tiles combined compared with the lowest quartile (HR, 1.40;
95% CI, 1.01 to 1.92). However, intake of red meat continued
to display a strong dose-dependent association with ESRD risk
(Supplemental Table 4). The risk estimates for quartiles 2, 3,
and 4 intakes were 1.16 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.72), 1.17 (95% CI,
0.78 to 1.75), and 1.47 (95% CI, 0.99 to 2.17), respectively
(Ptrend=0.06), in the overall adjusted model. All other food
sources of protein examined, including soy and legumes,
had null associations with ESRD risk in this subpopulation.
The same positive association with red meat was also observed
in participants with at least one underlying comorbidity risk
factor for ESRD, namely diabetes, hypertension, coronary
heart disease, or stroke. The risk estimates for quartiles 2, 3,

 and 4 intakes were 0.98 (95% CI, 0.77 to 1.24), 1.36 (95% CI,
1.08 to 1.72), and 1.42 (95% CI, 0.13 to 1.80), respectively
(Ptrend=0.003), in the overall adjusted model.
Exploring the effect of food replacement, we observed that
substituting one serving of red meat with either one serving of
poultry, fish, eggs, or soy and legumes resulted in a significant
decline of ESRD risk. Figure 2 shows the percentage change in
ESRD risk associated with the various food substitutions.
Substituting one daily serving of red meat with poultry resul-
ted in the highest reduction of ESRD risk of 62.4% (95% CI,
33.1 to 78.9; P,0.01). Substituting one daily serving of red
meat with fish was associated with 48.6% lower risk of ESRD
risk (95% CI, 21.4 to 66.5; P,0.01), whereas replacing one
daily serving of red meat with soy and legumes or eggs resulted
in 50.4% (95% CI, 31.3 to 64.2; P,0.01) and 44.9% (95% CI,
13.9 to 64.7; P,0.01) reduction in ESRD risk, respectively.
Similar reductions in ESRD risk were observed when we re-
placed 100 g servings of red meat with 100 g of poultry, fish,
eggs, or soy and legumes (results not shown).
DISCUSSION
Our study found that among the different food sources of
protein examined, red meat intake was strongly associated with
an increased risk of ESRD in a dose-dependent manner. No
association was found with intakes of poultry, fish, eggs, or
dairy products, whereas soy and legumes appeared to be slightly
protective. Substituting one serving of red meat with other
sources of protein significantly reduced the risk of ESRD.
Our finding of a strong positive relationship between red
meat intake and ESRD incidence is largely consistent with the
results of studies in other populations that have examined the
effect of animal protein or nondairy meat protein. In an
ecological study from Japan, there was a positive correlation
between annual ESRD incidence and animal protein intake by
geographical regions.17 The Nurses’ Health Study in the
United States found that women with a mostly Western-style
diet, which consisted of a higher intake of red and processed
meats, saturated fats, and sweets, had a higher risk of decline in
eGFR rate than the women who kept to a mostly Dietary Ap-
proaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)-style diet, which con-
sisted of a higher intake of vegetables, fruits, and whole
grains.20 A dietary pattern consisting mostly of processed
and fried foods, organ meats, and sweets, also known as the
Southern-style diet, has also been found to be associated with
an increased risk of mortality in patients with CKD.21
The decreased risk of CKD incidence or progression and
death with a healthier dietary pattern was also observed by
Dunkler et al. who studied participants from the Ongoing
Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global
Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). They found that subjects who
consumed a “high intake of healthy foods, such as vegetables,
and lower intake of unhealthy foods, such as fried foods” had
lower risks of developing CKD. However, they also found
that a higher intake of meat decreased CKD incidence or pro-
gression, which contrasts with the results of our study.22 We
noted that ONTARGET involved a high risk population,
which consisted entirely of subjects with diabetes, for a com-
paratively short period of time of 5.5 years. In contrast, only
about 10% of our study subjects had diabetes at recruitment,
and our study subjects were studied for a median of 15.5 years.
Interestingly, whereas increased intake of animal-sourced pro-
teinwas associated with increased intake of plant-sourced pro-
tein in the ONTARGET trial, participants who ate more meat
in our study were found to eat less soy, fruits, and vegetables.
Hence, these differences may explain the discrepancy between
the findings of the ONTARGET trial and our study. In our
study, the positive relationship between red meat and ESRD
risk was present in those with or without existing comorbid-
ities that strongly correlated with CKD, suggesting the pro-
pensity of meat to worsen CKD progression in those with
underlying comorbidity risk factors as well as to cause CKD
de novo in apparently healthy individuals without known risk
factors for CKD.
We also found that the substitution of one serving of red
meat per day with a serving of other sources of protein may
reduce the risk of ESRD. Poultry, fish, eggs, soy, and legumes
were all protective relative to red meat. High dietary acid load
has been shownto be associated with higher incidence of ESRD
in the general population in the United States.23 Conversely,
plant-based proteins (e.g., soy and legumes) and fruits and
vegetables have a high basal load.24 Therapy with alkali has
been shown to slow the progression to ESRD in randomized
controlled trials.25 Published data have shown that red meat
generally yields greater acid production than other animal-
sourced protein, although the difference is not that dra-
matic.26 Hence, a plausible explanation could be that red
meat may produce endogenously more acid that other pro-
tein-rich food, and the differential ability to induce endoge-
nous acid and base offers one explanation for the observed
association between red mean and ESRD risk in our study
population. Other explanations include the roles of nitrites,
nitrates, heme iron, advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs),

 and advanced lipoxidation endproducts (ALEs) found in red
meat.27 Specifically, dietary AGEs and ALEs have been postu-
lated to play a role in diabetes mellitus due to their oxidative
properties, and it has been shown that patients with CKD and
ESRD have higher levels of circulatory AGEs and ALEs.28 Fi-
nally, previously published results have shown that the meth-
ods of cooking meats in this population were similar, with
boiling or steaming being the most common method.29
Hence, we do not think that the method of cooking of red
meat plays a significant role in the risk of ESRD, nor does it
explain the differences in ESRD risks with different types of
meat found in this study. Future studies are needed to inves-
tigate the underlying mechanisms as to how other compounds
present in red meat may deteriorate renal function.
The strengths of our study include its prospective design,
large sample size, and long-term and complete follow-up of
outcomes. The dietary intake was assessed using a validated
food frequency questionnaire that was developed specifically
for this population and demonstrated to be internally consis-
tent and reproducible.30 We also had nearly complete morbidity
assessment with objectively obtained records on the incidence
of ESRD using the nationwide Singapore Renal Registry, which
has a high rate of follow up and strict definitions of ESRD that
follow international guidelines.31 The age-specific rates for the
Singapore population for treated ESRD in those above 70 years
old was close to 1000 per million population.31 In this cohort,
the rates were 1090 per million for men, and 967 per million for
women. Hence, the rate in this cohort was comparable with the
national rate. Lag sensitivity analysis and the exclusion analysis
of patients with existing chronic diseases known to contribute
to CKD yielded similar results to those derived from the entire
cohort, lending support for an underlying role of red meat in
the pathogenesis of and progression to ESRD. The substitution
analysis demonstrates the amount of avoidance in the propor-
tion of ESRD in a population with the replacement of red meat
with other food sources of protein.

Dietary Protein and ESRD Risk
309
www.jasn.org
CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
 The limitations of our study are those related to the nature
of an observation study, the use of self-report, and one-time
assessment of diet, which could lead to misclassification bias
due to measurement error. However, given the prospective
design, the potential misclassification error is unlikely to be
different between ESRD cases and noncase participants.
Hence, such nondifferential misclassification with respect to
disease status could likely result in an underestimation of risk.
Although we performed multivariate Cox regression analysis
with a comprehensive adjustment for known lifestyle and
comorbidity riskfactorsforESRDandallotherfoodsourcesof
protein, we cannot completely rule out residual confounding
due to unmeasured potential confounders. As reported pre-
viously, red meat intake in this population consisted mainly of
pork (97%).29 Thus, generalizability to other common sour-
ces of red meat including beef and lamb needs further evalu-
ation. We also did not collect any biomarkers as part of this
study and were not able to measure the progression of kidney
disease, if any, over time. Information on CKD deaths that
were not due to ESRD may not be comprehensive as many
laboratories in Singapore still do not routinely report eGFR,
and therefore earlier stages of CKD as an underlying diagnosis
of death may be under-reported. However, the data on our
primary outcome of incident ESRD, including deaths from
ESRD, were comprehensive. Finally, given the observational
nature of the study, any inference on causality should be made
with caution.
In summary, protein intake from red meat is positively
associated with increased ESRD risk. Substituting red meat
with other food sources of protein may reduce the risk of
developing ESRD, especially in high-risk populations. Future
studiesarewarrantedtoconfirmourfindingsandtoinvestigate
the underlying mechanisms as to how the acid load or other
compounds present in red meat may aggravate the progression
of CKD.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Population
As described previously, the Singapore Chinese Health Study is a
population-based cohort of 63,257 Chinese adults, aged 45–74 years
during recruitment from April 1993 to December 1998.30 The study
recruited participants who resided in government housing estates,
facilities in which 86% of Singaporeans resided during the recruit-
ment period. We also restricted the participants to those belonging to
the two major dialect groups, Hokkien and Cantonese, who origi-
nated from the contiguous provinces of Fujian and Guangdong in the
southern part of China. At recruitment, after obtaining informed
consent, trained interviewers conducted face-to-face interviews in
participants’ homes using a structured, scanner-readable question-
naire that ascertained information on demographics, height, weight,
tobacco use, physical activity, and medical history. Habitual diet in
the preceding year was captured using a validated 165-item food
frequency questionnaire.30
The present study was approved by the Institutional Review Board
oftheNationalUniversityofSingapore.Allparticipantsgaveinformed
consent.
Assessment of Diet and Covariates
The semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire included 165
commonly consumed food items in this population which were
categorized into rice and noodle, meats (pork/beef/mutton, poultry,
fish, and shellfish), vegetables, fruits, soy foods, legumes, dairy
products, beverages, condiments, and preserved foods. The partic-
ipants were instructed to select from eight frequency categories
(ranging from “never or hardly ever” to “two or more times a day”)
and three portion sizes (small, medium, large) with the aid of pho-
tographs. As previously described, the dietary nutrients of the food
items were derived from the Singapore Food Composition Database,
which was developed together with this cohort study and is a food-
nutrient database that lists the levels of 96 nutritive/non-nutritive
compounds per 100 g of cooked food and beverages in the Singaporean
Chinese diet.30
The food frequency questionnaire was subsequently validated
using two 24-hour recalls and readministration of the food frequency
questionnaire among 810 cohort participants. The correlation co-
efficient by these two methods for each dietary component ranged
between 0.24 and 0.79, and the differences between mean values of
most pairs for energy and nutrients were within 10% of each other’s
values.30
Incident ESRD Cases and CKD Mortality Cases
ESRD cases were identified by linking the cohort database with the
population-based Singapore Renal Registry. The Singapore Renal
Registry hasbeenshown tobecomprehensiveinits recordingof ESRD
cases since 1999.31 Multiple sources are used to identify ESRD cases,
and these include laboratory records, hospital records, and listings of
patients on dialysis. Since 2011 notifications of ESRD have been made
compulsory under the National Registry of Diseases Act. Consistent
with other international guidelines, the registry defines ESRD as
meeting at least one of the following criteria: (1) serum creatinine
Figure 2. Substituting one serving of red meat with one serving of
poultry, fish, eggs, or soy and legumes resulted in significant
percent reduction in relative risk of ESRD; all P,0.01.

 level $880 mmol/L (10 mg/dl), (2) eGFR,15 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(based on either the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study
equation, Cockcroft Gault equation, or 24-hour creatinine clear-
ance), (3) undergoing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, or (4)
has undergone kidney transplant. Criteria 1–3 had to be persistent
for .3 months to qualify as ESRD.2,31 CKD death was defined ac-
cording to the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, codes 585.0–586.9 that were recorded as the primary cause of
death in death certificates. The team of nurses performed audits of
ESRD cases annually to ensure data accuracy of at least 95% and inter-
rater reliability (k coefficient) of $75%. As of 31 Dec 2012, only 47
subjects (0.07%) from our cohort were known to be lost to follow-up
due to migration out of Singapore or for other reasons. This suggests
that emigration among these subjects was negligible. Thus the follow-
up via linkage with nationwide registries can be considered to be
virtually complete.
The current analysis included data from 60,198 participants after
excluding 110 participants who were diagnosed with ESRD, and
another 1927 participants whohad a diagnosis of cancer, at baseline. A
further 1022participantswho reported extreme calorie intakes(,600
or .3000 kcal/d for women, and ,700 or .3700 kcal/d for men)
were also excluded from the analysis.
Statistical Analyses
Primary outcome was defined as incident ESRD and secondary
outcome was defined as incident ESRD or CKD deaths in this study.
Person-yearsforeachparticipantwerecalculatedfromdateofbaseline
interview to date of reported ESRD, lost-to-follow-up, death, or
December31,2012,whicheveroccurred first.Thedifferencesbetween
baseline characteristics by ESRD status were examined using the chi-
squared test for categorical variables and t test for continuous vari-
ables. The dietary intakes of protein and food sources were analyzed
in quartiles of density intake. Cox proportional hazards regression
was used to calculate the HR and its 95% CI for developing ESRD by
using the lowest quartile of dietary intake as the reference group. The
proportional hazards assumption was met and no significant inter-
actions with time were observed for the variables of interest in our
study.
The energy-adjusted intakes of food, protein, and soy protein were
computed using the residual method to control for potential
confounding by total energy intake and to remove extraneous
variation due to total energy intake.32 This method involved using
linear regression to regress the food variable with total energy intake
to obtain the residuals. Then, the value of the food variable at the
mean population’s energy intake was added to the residuals to make it
more interpretable. The quartile levels of each energy-adjusted intake
for food/nutrient were derived from their respective distributions
among all the study participants in the cohort. Total energy intake
(kcal/d) was also included as a covariate in this residual model
method.32 Tests for trend were performed by using median values
of intake in the quartile categories as continuous variables in the Cox
regression models.
The selection of potential confounders was based primarily on
prior consideration of their associations with either dietary intake or
risk of ESRD in this population. Three different analytical models
were used: (1) model 1 (a basic model) included age (years), sex,
year of baseline interview (1993–1995, 1996–1998), dialect (Hokkien/
Cantonese), and educational level (none, primary school, second-
ary school, or higher); (2) model 2 included all variables in model 1
and the following variables: smoking status (never, ever), alcohol
consumption (none, occasionally, weekly, daily), body mass index
(,20.0, 20.0–23.9, 24.0–27.9, $28.0 kg/m2), physical activity (de-
fined as any weekly moderate activity, vigorous activity or strenu-
ous sports lasting at least 30 minutes, yes or no), self-reported
histories of physician-diagnosed hypertension, diabetes, coronary
heart disease, and stroke (yes or no for each disease), and total
energy intake; and (3) model 3 included all variables in model 1
and energy-adjusted intakes of red meat, poultry, fish and shellfish,
eggs, dairy products, soy foods, legumes, vegetables, and fruits (all
in quartiles).
We modeled the effects of substituting a serving of red meat for
an alternative food such as poultry, fish, eggs, soy, and legumes
using the method described by Halston et al.19 and Bernstein
et al.18 Briefly, the substitution analysis was performed by simul-
taneously including all dietary variables in continuous values in
the same multivariable model. The relative risk was then estimated
by considering the exponential of the difference in their coeffi-
cients. The corresponding 95% CI was then derived based on the
covariance between the two food items. To facilitate the substitu-
tion analysis, we further defined one serving as 90 g red meat, fish,
or poultry, 53 g eggs, and 80 g soy and legumes based on the dietary
definitions from the Singapore Health Promotion Board serving
size guide.33
Sensitivity analysis was conducted by repeating our analysis on
subjects with at least 4 years of follow-up (n=57,864) and those with-
out self-reported history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart
disease, and stroke (n=42,039), which are common comorbidities
associated with ESRD. We also repeated the substitution analysis by
“substituting” 100 g of red meat for 100 g of an alternative food source
(i.e., poultry, fish, eggs, or soy and legumes).
All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC), and statistical significance was based on two-sided
probability of 0.05.
