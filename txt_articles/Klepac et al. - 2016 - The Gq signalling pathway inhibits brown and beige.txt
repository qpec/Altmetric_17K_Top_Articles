Brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates nutritional energy as heat via the uncoupling protein-1
(UCP1) and BAT activity correlates with leanness in human adults. Here we profile G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in brown adipocytes to identify druggable regulators of
BAT. Twenty-one per cent of the GPCRs link to the Gq family, and inhibition of Gq signalling
enhances differentiation of human and murine brown adipocytes. In contrast, activation of Gq
signalling abrogates brown adipogenesis. We further identify the endothelin/Ednra pathway
as an autocrine activator of Gq signalling in brown adipocytes. Expression of a constitutively
active Gq protein in mice reduces UCP1 expression in BAT, whole-body energy expenditure
and the number of brown-like/beige cells in white adipose tissue (WAT). Furthermore,
expression of Gq in human WAT inversely correlates with UCP1 expression. Thus, our data
indicate that Gq signalling regulates brown/beige adipocytes and inhibition of Gq signalling
may be a novel therapeutic approach to combat obesity.

 B
rown adipose tissue (BAT) is important for basal and
inducible energy expenditure in mammals1–5. Importantly,
recent
findings
indicate
that
adult
humans
possess
metabolically active BAT6 and that obese subjects have reduced
activity of BAT7. BAT uniquely expresses the uncoupling
protein-1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein which uncouples
ATP production from oxidative phosphorylation leading to
energy expenditure in a thermogenic manner. In contrast, white
adipose tissue (WAT) is mainly responsible for energy storage
and is an important endocrine tissue that releases adipokines,
which in turn regulate energy intake and expenditure8. Brown-fat
like cells have recently been described in WAT depots9 and their
number and activity can be strongly induced by cold exposure, a
process described as ‘browning’2,10.
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a large family
of seven transmembrane proteins11,12 that regulate important
biological
processes
in
diverse
tissues
including
adipose
tissue13,14. Approximately 25% of currently marketed drugs
target GPCRs, illustrating their importance in disease and
therapeutics. GPCRs are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins,
which are composed of Ga, b and g subunits. Activation of
GPCRs leads to the disassociation of Ga from the Gbg dimer,
allowing the binding and regulation of signalling effectors. The
downstream signalling of GPCRs is in part determined by their G
protein coupling15. There are four main classes of Ga proteins:
Gs, Gi, Gq and G12/13. Activation of Gs and Gi leads to the
stimulation or inhibition of cAMP signalling, respectively, while
Gq activates phospholipase C (PLC). G12/13 activates the small
GTPase Rho, a pathway also known to be modulated by the Gq
family of proteins16,17.
Until now, the analysis of BAT GPCRs has focused mainly on a
few Gs-coupled receptors (for example, b-adrenergic4 and
adenosine18
receptors)
that
activate
cAMP
signalling
and
UCP1-dependent thermogenesis. The function of other Ga
GPCR families in adipocytes is not as clear. Therefore, in the
present
study,
we
investigate
the
expression
pattern
of
non-odorant GPCRs in brown adipocytes (BAs). Our analysis
reveals that Gq-coupled receptors are highly expressed in
brown adipocytes. Moreover, using pharmacological and genetic
approaches, we found that Gq, via modulation of RhoA signalling,
regulates adipogenesis of BAs in vitro and in vivo.
Results
GPCR expression of brown adipocytes. To identify the expres-
sion pattern of non-odorant/tastant GPCRs in BAs, we profiled
the transcript levels of 347 GPCRs. We detected 182 GPCRs
in preadipocytes and 230 in mature BAs (Supplementary
Tables 1,2). 18 GPCRs and 66 GPCRs were uniquely expressed
in preadipocytes and mature BAs, respectively (Fig. 1a). We used
the IUPHAR database (http://www.guidetopharmacology.org/)19
to define GPCRs. Class A and adhesion GPCRs represented the
two largest classes in both pre- and mature BAs (Table 1). During
differentiation, class A receptors increased from 139 to 188
receptors, whereas 13 out of the 20 adhesion GPCRs expressed in
preadipocytes decreased upon differentiation with five of them
decreasing below the detection limit (Table 1). With respect to
coupling to heterotrimeric G proteins, we found that 14.0 and
31.5% of the GPCRs detected in BAs interact with Gs and Gi,
respectively (Fig. 1b). Unexpectedly, 21.5% of the GPCRs
expressed in BAs are predicted to link with Gq/11 (Fig. 1b).
Preadipocytes exhibited a similar pattern of GPCR linkage
(Fig. 1c). During differentiation, the expression levels of 91
GPCRs changed more than twofold, with 26 and 65 showing a
decrease or increase in expression, respectively (Supplementary
Fig. 1a,b). During brown adipogenesis, Gq- and Gi-coupled
GPCRs were the largest group of receptors with known G protein
linkages to be down- and upregulated, respectively (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1a,b).
To validate the expression pattern of GPCRs, we focused on six
Gq-coupled GPCRs that are highly expressed in pre- and/or
mature BAs as identified by the GPCR array (Supplementary
Tables 1,2): Endothelin (ET) receptors type A and B (Ednra
and Ednrb), Adrenoceptor Alpha 1A (Adra1a), Angiotensin II
receptor, type 1a and 1b (Agtr1a and Agtr1b) and Cholinergic
Receptor, Muscarinic 3 (Chrm3). Both quantitative PCR (qPCR)
and TaqMan GPCR array data demonstrated high expression of
Ednra mRNA in preadipocytes and an increase of Ednra during
differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Ednrb increased 280-fold
(qPCR) and 332-fold (GPCR array) during differentiation;
Adra1a increased 83-fold (qPCR) and 322-fold (GPCR array);
Agtr1a increased 3.9-fold (qPCR) and 2.9-fold (GPCR array)
(Supplementary Fig. 1c).
Gq and G11 are both expressed in preadipocytes, BAs and BAT
and their levels of expression did not change significantly during
differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 1d). Thus, GPCR/Gq/11
signalling might contribute to the differentiation and function
of BAs; however, virtually no information exists regarding this
signalling pathway in BAT.
Regulation of adipogenesis by Gq. We inhibited Gq/11 signal
transduction using pharmacological and genetic approaches.
Treatment with FR900359 (FR; 1 mM), a natural inhibitor of
Gq/11 (ref. 20), enhanced differentiation of murine BAs, as
demonstrated by increased Oil Red O staining (Fig. 1d) and
elevated protein levels of the adipogenic markers aP2 and
PPARg as well as of the thermogenic marker UCP1 (Fig. 1e,f).
To complement the pharmacological approach, we used lentiviral
small hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed only against Gq (shGq).
Knockdown of Gq by B50% (Supplementary Fig. 1e) significantly
increased adipogenesis, with increased lipid staining (Fig. 1d)
and expression of adipogenic markers and UCP1 (Fig. 1g,h).
Inactivation of Gq signalling thus promotes differentiation of
murine BAs.
To determine the impact of increased Gq signalling on brown
adipogenesis, we first selectively enhanced Gq signalling using
a Gq-coupled designer GPCR (DREADD)21 that represents a
modified M3 muscarinic receptor (Dq)22. Dq couples exclusively
to
Gq
and
is
activated
by
otherwise
pharmacologically
inactive clozapine-N-oxide (CNO)22. Brown preadipocytes were
transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing Dq. To analyse
Gq-induced responses in living cells in a label-free manner, we
used biosensor technology based on dynamic mass redistribution
(DMR). Treatment of Dq-expressing cells with CNO (1 mM)
induced
a
concentration-dependent
DMR
response
with
half-maximal activation at 269 nM (Fig. 1i,j). In contrast,
no DMR response was observed in buffer- or CNO-treated
wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. 1f). The Dq-induced DMR
response was markedly different from the optical traces obtained
by stimulation of Gs with isoprenaline (Supplementary Fig. 1g,h),
implying that DMR can be used to monitor different G protein
signalling pathways in BAs. Treatment of Dq cells with FR
abolished the CNO-induced DMR response, providing further
evidence for FR as a Gq inhibitor (Fig. 1j and Supplementary
Fig. 1i).
Dq stimulation during BA differentiation reduced Oil Red O
staining (Supplementary Fig. 1j), suppressed expression of
adipogenic markers aP2 and PPARg and of UCP1 (Fig. 1k,l).
Treatment of non-transduced control cells or cells transduced
with
a control
virus
(LVctrl)
with CNO
did
not
affect
differentiation (Fig. 1k,l and Supplementary Fig. 1j). Expression
of Dq without CNO stimulation did not alter BA differentiation
(Fig. 1k,l and Supplementary Fig. 1j).

 Secondly, we used lentiviral vectors to express a constitutively
active mutant of Gq (LVGqQL) as a means to enhance Gq
signalling. We
validated the activity of GqQL
in brown
preadipocytes by measuring IP1 in non-transduced cells and
cells that express either GFP or GqQL. IP1 is a downstream
metabolite of PLC and IP3, a pathway known to be activated by
Gq GPCRs. We found that IP1 levels were highly increased in
preadipocytes that express GqQL compared with GFP-expressing
or control cells (Supplementary Fig. 1k). GqQL overexpression
during adipocyte differentiation reduced Oil Red O staining and
inhibited the expression of adipogenic and thermogenic markers
(Fig. 1m,n and Supplementary Fig. 1l) in a similar manner as did
the DREADD approach.
Endothelin/Ednra regulation of brown adipocytes. To identify
an endogenous receptor that activates Gq signalling in BAs, we
focused on Ednra, one of the most highly expressed Gq-coupled
GPCRs in preadipocytes and BAs (Supplementary Tables 1,2).

 system: Endothelin-1 (ET-1), ET receptors type A and B
(Ednra and Ednrb) and ET converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1)
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). Although ECE-1 was expressed at low
levels in BA, it is not the only enzyme that can catalyse the
production of ET-1 (ref. 23). Importantly, ET-1 was released
by both cell types (Fig. 2a) and its secretion was inhibited by
noradrenaline (NE) (Fig. 2a).
Differentiation of BAs was inhibited by chronic treatment with
ET-1 (0.3 nM) but was restored by the selective Ednra antagonist
BQ-123 (100 nM) (Fig. 2b–d) and by treatment with FR (1 mM)
(Fig. 2e–g). Notably, BQ-123 increased the differentiation of the
untreated cells. In contrast, ET-1 effects on differentiation were
not restored with the Ednrb antagonist BQ-788 (100 nM)
(Supplementary Fig. 2b–d). Moreover, acute treatment of mature
BAs with ET-1 reduces lipoprotein lipase gene expression24.
Lipoprotein lipase is important for fatty acid uptake and fuels
cold-/NE-induced BAT thermogenesis25. Together these data
implicate ET-1 as an autocrine/paracrine inhibitor of BA function
that signals via Ednra/Gq and is regulated by NE signalling.
Gq regulation of BAs via Rho/Rho-kinase. Gq can activate
multiple intracellular signalling pathways including IP3/DAG,
Ca2 þ, ERK and also by GTP-binding proteins of the Ras and Rho
families16,17. Since Rho/Rho-kinase (ROCK) controls brown
adipogenesis26,27, we evaluated this pathway. Cells expressing
GqQL had a marked increase in phalloidin staining of actin
filaments (Fig. 2h) and Rho activity (Rho-GTP pull-down assay)
(Fig. 2i). In addition, pharmacological inhibition of ROCK
with Y-27632 (10 mM) enhanced differentiation and increased
expression of adipogenic and thermogenic markers in GqQL-
expressing BAs (Fig. 2j–l). ROCK inhibition also restored
adipogenesis of ET-1 treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 2e–g).
These results suggest that Gq inhibits BA differentiation via the
RhoA/ROCK pathway.
In vivo regulation of BAT by Gq signalling. To study the effects
of elevated Gq signalling in vivo, we expressed constitutively
active Gq in BAT (Fig. 3a). Lentiviral particles encoding either
GqQL (LVGqQL) or GFP (LVGFP) under the control of the
CMV promoter were directly injected into BAT of mice that were
subsequently cold-exposed for 2 weeks (Fig. 3b). Histological
analysis revealed increased size of the lipid droplets with more
unilocular, white-like adipocytes in LVGqQL-injected BAT and
decreased UCP1 staining (Fig. 3c). Expression of GqQL decreased
UCP1 protein level in BAT by B20% (Fig. 3d) and decreased
expression of the mitochondrial marker genes Nd5 and Ndufa
(Fig. 3a).
In addition, we generated transgenic mice that express
either GqQL or GFP (control) under the control of the UCP1
promoter (UCP1-GqQL and UCP1-GFP, respectively) to achieve
BA-specific expression (Fig. 3e), and exposed them to cold.
Similar to what occurred after injection of LVGqQL, immuno-
histochemical staining of BAT from UCP1-GqQL mice revealed
enlarged, unilocular lipid droplets and reduced UCP1 staining
(Fig. 3f). UCP1 expression of BAT of UCP1-GqQL mice was
significantly decreased compared with the control UCP1-GFP
group (Fig. 3e,g). Indirect calorimetry revealed significantly
reduced O2 consumption in cold-exposed UCP1-GqQL mice
(Fig. 3h,i). Together, these results indicate that Gq activation
induces a phenotypic change of BAT towards WAT (a process
also known as ‘whitening’28) with diminished thermogenic
capacity of BAT.
Apart from classical interscapular BAT, inducible brown (also
known as beige/brite) adipocytes have been identified in murine
and human WAT2,10. Exposure of transgenic UCP1-GqQL mice
to cold, induced a 1.9-fold and 1.5-fold increase in UCP1
promoter-driven Gq expression in inguinal (iWAT) and gonadal/
visceral (gWAT) WAT, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b).
Histological
analysis
of
both
iWAT
and
gWAT
revealed
‘browning’ in the control mice that express GFP under the
control of the UCP1 promoter (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Fig. 3c). In contrast, iWAT and gWAT of GqQL mice exhibited
larger lipid droplets with decreased expression of BA markers
(UCP1, PGC1-a and DIO2) (Fig. 4a,b and Supplementary
Fig. 3c,d).
Further evidence for a role of Gq in inducible brown/beige cells
was obtained by induction of browning in isolated primary
murine adipocytes (Fig. 4c). Using the DREADD system
(Fig. 1i–l), we activated Gq signalling with CNO (10 mM), which
resulted in a significant reduction in UCP1 expression (Fig. 4c).
To explore the effect of enhanced Gq signalling on white
adipogenesis, we used murine white adipocytes isolated from
iWAT (WAi). We overexpressed Dq and activated it with CNO
throughout
differentiation.

differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 3e–g).
Role of Gq signalling in human adipocytes. Human BAT also
highly expresses Gq protein. We found Gq-coupled receptors that
were highly expressed in murine BAs are also highly expressed in
the human brown/beige adipocyte cell line (hMADS) (Ednra,
Ednrb, Adra1a, Agtr1 and Chrm3) (Supplementary Fig. 3h,i).
Treatment of the hMADS cells with FR (1 mM) enhanced
differentiation and expression of adipogenic markers aP2 and
PPARg and thermogenic marker UCP1 (Fig. 4d,e). Moreover,
we found a relationship between expression of Gq and the
thermogenic markers UCP1 and CIDEA in WAT samples
from 266 human subjects (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 3j).
UCP1 and CIDEA expression were both significantly inversely
correlated with Gq; results that are consistent with the idea that
Gq expression negatively affects the thermogenic capacity in
humans (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Fig. 3j).
Discussion
In the present study, we screened for non-chemosensory GPCRs
in murine brown preadipocytes and mature adipocytes. GPCR
profiling revealed that BAs express more than 180 GPCRs and
that the expression pattern changes greatly upon differentiation.
The number of GPCRs detected is in agreement with previous
analysis performed on human subcutaneous adipose tissue and
murine metabolic tissues that detected 163 and 198 GCPRs,
respectively29,30. In BAs, we found that Gq-coupled receptors
were one of the largest groups and that their expression was
highly altered during differentiation, indicating a potential role in
adipogenesis. Importantly, we show that Gq signalling is a
crucial inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation, through activation
of the Rho/ROCK signalling cascade, a major regulator of BA
differentiation26 (Fig. 4g).

 Treatment with the Gq inhibitor FR enhanced the adipogenic
and thermogenic potential of BAs, indicating either the presence
of constitutively active Gq receptors and/or an autocrine loop of
Gq signalling in BAs. Analysis of highly expressed Gq-coupled
GPCRs indicated that murine BAs and human brown/beige cells
express ET receptors. Moreover, murine BAs also express the

 enzymes necessary for ET production and secretion. Stimulation
with ET-inhibited adipogenesis, while the inhibition of Gq and
Ednra, but not Ednrb, rescued adipogenesis of ET-treated cells.
Recently, Xue et al.31 identified Endrb as a genetic marker
that positively correlates with the thermogenic capacity of
cloned human BAs. Inhibition of Ednra alone increased the
differentiation of untreated cells, indicating endogenous activity
of the ET system in BAs. Thus, our data implicate the ET-1/Ednra
signalling axis as an autocrine/paracrine inhibitor of brown/beige
adipogenesis via Gq signalling (Fig. 4g). In addition to its function
in BAT, ET-1 plays an important role in the vasculature and
excessive ET-1 contributes to atherosclerosis32 as well as to the
disturbed insulin-induced vasorelaxation in obesity33.
Our data also indicate an inhibitory role of Gq in BAT function
and browning in vivo. Overexpression of GqQL induced a
phenotype of BAT reminiscent of ‘whitening’, while preventing
the ‘browning’ of WAT in mice exposed to cold. Overall,
activation of Gq signalling in brown/beige adipocytes resulted in
reduced whole-body energy expenditure of cold-exposed mice.
Thus, our data show that the Gq signalling pathway inhibits
brown and beige adipose tissue in vivo and the studies done using
cultured adipocytes show that Gq signalling inhibits adipogenesis
in a more general manner. Furthermore, we found a negative
correlation between Gq and UCP1 mRNA expression in human
abdominal WAT. Although abdominal adipose tissue is pre-
dominantly white, it can be induced to brown and inducible
brown-like cells have been identified in abdominal fat after b-3
adrenergic receptor treatment34. Further studies are required to
investigate the role of alterations in the expression of BAT marker
genes in abdominal fat depots in adult humans. Interestingly, Gq
signalling is not only involved in regulation of adipocyte
differentiation and non-shivering thermogenesis, but also in the
CNS regulation of appetite35.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate a previously unappre-
ciated role in brown/beige adipogenesis for Gq, to which B20%
of the GPCRs expressed in these cells are predicted to couple. Our
findings suggest that antagonizing Gq signalling by targeting
Gq-coupled GPCRs and/or by directly inhibiting Gq represent

 previously unexplored ways to enhance the amount of brown/
beige fat and thus increase energy expenditure.
Methods
Isolation and differentiation of BAs. BAT-derived mesenchymal stem cells were
isolated from interscapular BAT of newborn wild-type mice26,36. Excised BAT was
incubated for 30 min at 37 �C in digestion buffer (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 123 mM Na þ, 5 mM K þ, 1.3 mM Ca2 þ,
131 mM Cl �, 5 mM glucose, 1.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA), 100 mM
Hepes and 0.2% (w/v) collagenase type II (pH 7.4)). After digestion, tissue
remnants were removed by filtration through a 100 mm nylon mesh and placed on
ice for the next 30 min. The infranatant was filtered through a 30 mm nylon mesh
and centrifuged at 700g for 10 min. The pellet containing mesenchymal stem cells
was resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS),
100 IU penicillin, streptomycin (100 mg ml � 1) (P/S), 4 nM insulin, 4 nM
triiodothyronine, 10 mM Hepes and sodium ascorbate (25 mg ml � 1).
Approximately 60,000 cells per cm2 were seeded on a six-well plate and grown at
37 �C and 5% CO2. Preadipocytes were immortalized using the lentivirus
containing the SV40 large T antigen and unselected cells were cultured in DMEM
supplemented with FBS and P/S (GM). The cells were expanded in GM at 37 �C,
5% CO2 (ref. 37).
For differentiation, immortalized cells were seeded in GM on a six-well plate in
a density of B180,000 cells per well. 48 h after seeding (day � 2), GM was replaced
by differentiation medium (DM), supplemented with FBS, P/S, 20 nM insulin
and 1 nM triiodothyronine. Confluent cells (day 0) were then treated for 48 h
with BAT induction medium, which was DM supplemented with 0.5 mM
isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) and 1 mM dexamethasone. After the induction,
cells were treated with DM for the next 5 days, which was replenished every second
day. Where indicated, cells were treated every second day with the Gq inhibitor
FR (1 mM), ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 (Tocris, 10 mM), CNO (Tocris, 1 mM),
Endothelin-1 (ET-1) (Tocris, 0.3 nM), Ednra inhibitor BQ-123 or Ednrb inhibitor
BQ-788 (both Tocris, 100 nM). In the experiments with ET-1; FR, Y-27632,
BQ-123 or BQ-788 were added to the culture medium 30 min before the
addition of ET-1.
For all the preadipocyte experiments, the cells were used on day � 2. For
mature BA experiments, the cells were used on day þ 7 after induction.
Isolation and differentiation of white and beige adipocytes. WAT-derived
mesenchymal stem cells were isolated from inguinal white fat pads of 8- to
12-week-old wild-type mice. Excised WAT was incubated for 30 min at 37 �C in
digestion buffer (DMEM containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA and 0.15% (w/v) collagenase
type II). After digestion, cells were allowed to stand for 10 min at room temperature
and centrifuged at 700g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in GM and filtered
through a 100 mm nylon mesh. Approximately 180,000 cells per well were seeded in
GM on a six-well plate at 37 �C and 5% CO2.
For differentiation, cells were induced 2 days after reaching confluence (day 0)
for 48 h, using WAT induction medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS,
1% P/S, 1 mM dexamethasone, 0.5 mM IBMX, 1 nM triiodothyronine, 1 mM
D-biotin, 17 mM pantothenate, L-ascorbate (50 mg ml � 1), 1 mM rosiglitazone
and 0.172 mM insulin). After the induction, cells were treated with maintainance
medium (DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS, P/S, 1 nM triiodothyronine, 1 mM
D-biotin, 17 mM pantothenate, L-ascorbate (50 mg ml � 1), 1 mM and 0.172 mM
insulin) for the next 7 days, which was replenished every second day. For
differentiation experiments, cells were treated every second day with CNO (1 mM).

 Browning was induced by 8 h NE (1 mM) stimulation, in the presence or absence of
CNO (10 mM).
For all the preadipocyte experiments, the cells were used on day � 2. For
mature white adipocyte experiments, the cells were used on day þ 7 after
induction.
hMADS differentiation. Human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells were
provided by the laboratory of C. Dani (University of Nice SophiaAntipolis)38 and
differentiated into brown/beige cells as follows18,39. Cells were seeded on 12-well
plates in growth medium (DMEM Low Glucose (Lonza), supplemented with
1x glutamine (Lonza), 10 mM Hepes buffer (Lonza), penicillin-streptomycin
5,000 IU ml � 1 to 5,000 UG ml � 1 (Lonza) and 10% FBS (S.A Dutscher, Brumath,
France)) containing 2.5 ng ml � 1 FGF2 (Peprotech) at a density of B160,000 cells
per well. After 48 h, medium was replaced with growth medium containing no
FGF2. When the cells reached confluency, growth medium was replaced by
hMADS induction medium (day 0) (growth medium supplemented with
5 mg ml � 1 insulin, 10 mg ml � 1 transferrin, 0.2 nM triiodothyronine, 1 mM
rosiglitazone, 100 mM IBMX and 1 mM dexamethasone) for the next 72 h. Cells
were then cultured in differentiation medium (induction medium without IBMX
and dexamethasone) for 9 more days. Where indicated, cells were treated from day
0 to day 12 with the Gq inhibitor FR (1 mM).
For all the pre-adipocyte experiments, the cells were used on day � 2. For
mature BA experiments, the cells were used on day þ 12 after induction.
RNA isolation and real-time RT-PCR (qPCR). RNA was isolated using Trizol
method (Analytik Jena AG). The samples from human retroperitoneal BAT have
been previously described40. cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 mg RNA using
Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche). Real-time RT-PCR (qPCR)
was performed with SYBR-Green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) or
LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master (Roche) using a HT7900 instrument
(Applied Biosystems). Fold changes were calculated using relative quantification
methods with mHPRT (murine hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase)
serving as an internal control unless otherwise stated. Primer sequences are
available in Supplementary Table 3.
GPCR expression analysis. GPCR profiling was performed using TaqMan Mouse
GPCR Arrays (Applied Biosystems) for quantitative expression analysis of mouse
GPCR genes41. These arrays detect 347 non-chemosensory GPCRs. cDNA was
synthesized from 0.5 mg RNA using Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Roche). Two nanograms of cDNA was used for each gene in the GPCR arrays.
Quantification of GPCR cDNA expression was normalized to 18S rRNA. Data
shown are an average of three independent arrays. GPCRs were considered
unexpressed if at least two of the arrays had a delta Ct above 25. G protein
coupling of GPCRs was determined using the IUPHAR database (http://
guidetopharmacology.org/).
Lentiviral infection. Constitutively active Gq (GqQL), was provided by Silvio
Gutkind, NIH42 Constitutive activity was achieved by mutating Glutamine to
Leucine at the amino acid residue 209. Lentiviral vectors were obtained by cloning
constitutively active Gq into the Bam HI and Sal I sites of the vector
p156rrlsinPPTCMV, which carries a murine uncoupling protein-1 promoter
(UCP1-GqQL) or ubiquitous CMV promoter (LVGqQL). Control vectors
(p156rrlsinPPT) contain green fluorescent protein (UCP1-GFP and LVGFP).
The shRNA against Gq and the control shRNA were purchased from Sigma
Aldrich and were expressed under the U6 promoter (pLKO.1-U6-sh- ctrl
sequence: 50-GCATGCAGAAGTGTAAAGCTA-30, pLKO.1-U6-sh-Gq-287918-
PGK-Puro 50-GCTTGTGGAATGATCCTGGAA-30).
pLenti6.3V5-HA-hM3D(Gq)-mCherry (Dq) lentiviral vectors were obtained
from Bryan Roth, University of North Carolina. pLenti6.3-CMV-TO-GFP-
Blasticidin was used as the control virus (LVctrl) for the Dq experiments.
Lentiviral particles were generated by transfection of HEK293T cells with vector
constructs and packaging plasmids26,36. Viral particles were concentrated by
ultracentrifugation26,36. For the lentiviral infection, cells were seeded on a six-well
plate and transduced with lentiviruses corresponding to 50 ng (RTase quantified by
ELISA) UCP1-GqQL, UCP1-GFP, LVGqQL or LVGFP; 75 ng Dq or LVctrl and
100 ng of the shRNA viruses for 12–16 h. Cells were further differentiated as
described above.
Oil Red O staining. Mature BAs were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraf-
ormaldehyde (PFA). After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with Oil Red
O (Sigma) solution (3 mg ml � 1 in 60% isopropyl alcohol) for 3 h at room
temperature, washed with PBS and visualized under a microscope.
Western blot analysis. Protein lysates from cells and tissues were isolated26,36
using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM sodium chloride, 1% NP-40, 0.5%
sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1 mM EGTA) supplemented
with complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 mM Na3VO4 and 10 mM NaF.
Protein contents were determined by the Bradford method. Proteins were
separated using SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto
a nitrocellulose membrane.. Membrane was blocked for 1 h in 5% BSA in
Tris-Buffered Saline and 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated over night at 4 �C
in different primary antibodies (all primary antibodies diluted 1:1,000). Incubation
in secondary antibody was performed the next day, for 1 h at room temperature in
5% milk in TBST. Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence
(ECL) reagent and quantified by densitometric analysis with Image J software.
Antibodies directed at the following were used: aP2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Cat#: sc-18661), PPARg (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Cat#: sc-7273); UCP1
(Sigma Aldrich, Cat#: sc-6529 and Thermo Fisher Scientific, Cat#: PA1-24894);
Tubulin (Dianova, Cat#: MS-719-P0) and GAPDH (Cell Signalling, Cat#: 2118).
Secondary horse radish peroxidase–linked antibodies against goat (Dianova,
Cat#: 705-035-147, dilution 1:5,000), mouse (Dianova, Cat#: 115-035-146, dilution
1:10,000) and rabbit (Cell Signalling, Cat#: 7074, dilution 1:5,000) were used.
Complete immunoblots of western blot sections are shown in Supplementary
Fig. 4.
Label-free dynamic mass redistribution assays. The DMR analysis was carried
out using the Corning Epic system (Corning, NY, USA) in conjunction with a
Cybi-SELMA semi-automated electronic pipetting system (Analytik Jena AG, Jena,
Germany)43. Briefly, brown preadipoyctes stably expressing Dq were seeded on
fibronectin-coated 384-well biosensor plates at a density of 3,000 cells per well and
cultivated for 48 h in growth medium (37 �C, 5% CO2). Before the measurement,
cells were washed twice with assay buffer (Hanks balanced salt solution with
20 mM HEPES). Where indicated, cells were pre-incubated with FR (1 mM) for 1 h
or cholera toxin (CTX; 100 ng ml � 1) for 18–20 h before measurement. DMR was
monitored for at least 5,000 s. The optical DMR recordings were buffer-corrected.
To quantify the DMR signals for concentration-effect curves, the maximum
response within 1,000 s was calculated. pEC50 value determination and data
calculation were performed using GraphPad Prism 5.04 (GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, USA).
IP1 assay. Intracellular alteration of the second messenger IP1 was quantified with
the HTRF-IP1 kit (Cisbio Bioassays) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Briefly, brown preadipocytes non-transduced and transduced with lentiviruses
carrying GqQL (LVGqQL) or GFP (LVGFP) were cultivated for 48 h in growth
medium (37 �C, 5% CO2). For the assay, cells were resuspended in stimulation
buffer containing 50 mM LiCl and transferred to a 384-well microtiter plate at a
density of 12,500 cells per well. After 90 min incubation time, 3 ml of IP1-d2
conjugate followed by 3 ml of europium cryptate-labelled anti-IP1antibody solved
in lysis buffer were added to the cells to quantify intracellular IP levels. After a
further incubation of 1 h at room temperature, time-resolved fluorescence was
measured at 620 and 665 nm with the Mithras LB 940 multimode reader.
ET-1 ELISA assay. Cell culture medium was collected from the preadipocytes
and mature BAs, with or without 8 h NE (1 mM) stimulation. ET-1 ELISA
was performed using the Endothelin-1 ELISA kit (Enzo) according to the
manufacturer
´s instructions.
F-actin staining of adherent cells in culture. Glass coverslips were placed in
24-well plates and coated with fibronectin (5 mg ml � 1). Brown preadipocytes were
seeded at a density of 20,000 cells per well and serum-starved for 24 h. Cells were
incubated for 30 min with 10% FBS to induce the formation of F-actin stress fibres.
Cells were then fixed with 4% PFA, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-100, blocked
with 1% BSA/PBS and stained with phalloidin-Alexa 546. Coverslips were mounted
on glass slides using PermaFluor mounting medium and visualized using a
confocal microscope.
RhoA activation assay. Brown preadipocytes were seeded on a 10 cm tissue plate
at a density of 180,000 cells per plate and infected with lentiviruses carrying GqQL
or GFP (control) for 8 h. Cells were cultured until reaching 50–60% confluency,
serum-starved for 24 h and collected for RhoA activity measurement. RhoA
activation was assessed with an ELISA-based RhoA G-LISA Activation Assay
Kit (Cytoskeleton). The level of RhoA activity was determined by colorimetric
measurement at 490 nm. Active RhoA was normalized to total RhoA protein.
Lentiviral injections of constitutively active Gq (CMV-GqQL) into BAT.
Four-week-old male mice (C57BL/6, Charles River) were anaesthetized using
isoflurane. A small incision was made in the neck region and 1 mg of lentiviruses
carrying either GqQL (LVGqQL) or GFP (LVGFP) under control of the ubiquitous
CMV promoter were injected directly into each fat pad of BAT. After injections,
mice were acclimatized to cold for 1 week at 18 �C following 1 week of cold
exposure at 4 �C. During the study, the mice were maintained on a daily cycle of
12 h light (0600 to 1800 hours) and 12 h darkness (1800 to 0600 hours), and were
allowed free access to standard chow and water. The study was approved by the
Landesamt fu
¨r Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, NRW, Germany.

 Generation of transgenic mice and energy expenditure. Transgenic mice were
generated by subzonal injections44 of the lentiviruses UCP1-GqQL and UCP1-GFP
into oocyte of a wild-type donor mouse with C57BL/6 background. Ten-week-old
female mice were kept for one week at 18 �C followed by one week cold exposure at
4 �C. Oxygen consumption was measured with Phenomaster (TSE Systems)
for 120 s every 16 min for 24 h. During the study, the mice were maintained
on a daily cycle of 12 h light (0600–1800 hours) and 12 h darkness (1800–0600

Immunohistochemistry. BAT and WAT was fixed in PBS containing 4% PFA
for 48 h and dehydrated using ethanol. Tissue was embedded in paraffin and
cut into 5 mM sections. Sections were blocked with 2% normal goat serum-TBS
(tris-buffered saline) for 30 min RT and immunohistochemical stainings were
performed with a primary antibody (UCP1, 1:1,000, Sigma Aldrich) over night.
Secondary antibody-conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) was applied for 1 h at RT and sections were visualized using DAB
substrate (Vector Laboratories). Standard haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining
was performed on 5 mM tissue sections.
Analysis of human adipose tissue. Gq, UCP1 and CIDEA mRNA expression
were measured in abdominal omental and adipose tissue (AT) samples obtained in
parallel from 266 donors45 who underwent open abdominal surgery for Roux-en-Y
bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, explorative laparotomy or elective cholecystectomy. All
participants gave their written informed consent before taking part in the study.
All investigations have been approved by the ethics committee of the University of
Leipzig (363-10-13122010 and 017-12-230112) and were carried out in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Human Gq, UCP1 and CIDEA mRNA expression
was measured by qPCR using Assay-on-Demand gene expression kit (Gq: forward:
50-GTGGAGAAGGTGTCTGCTTTTGA-30; reverse: 50-ATCTTGTTGCGTAGG
CAGGTAGG-30; UCP1: Hs00222453_m1; CIDEA: Hs00154455_m1; Applied
Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany), and fluorescence was detected on an ABI
PRISM 7000 Sequence Detector (Applied Biosystems). Gq, UCP1 and CIDEA
mRNA expression was calculated relative to the mRNA expression of HPRT1
mRNA (Hs01003267_m1; Applied Biosystems).
Statistics. For cell culture experiments, ‘n’ indicates the number of cultures grown
and differentiated independently. For experiments with mice, ‘n’ indicates number
of mice per each group.
Single comparisons were analysed using two-tailed student’s t-test. For RhoA
activity assay, one-tailed student’s t-test was used. Multiple comparisons were
analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Newman-Keuls post-hoc test.
Values below 0.05 were considered significant. Analyses were performed using
GraphPad Prism 5 software. All data are represented as mean±s.e.m. The sample
size was chosen based on our previous in vitro and in vivo studies39.
