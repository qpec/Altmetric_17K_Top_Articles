INTRODUCTION: Infection causes inflam-
mation, which contributes to pathogen clear-
ance and organismal survival. The balance
between the intensity and resolution of an
inflammatory response is key for the fitness
of the organism. Sepsis, for example, is a life-
threatening condition caused by an excessive
host response to infection, which in turn leads
to multi-organ failure and death. Worldwide,
millions of people each year succumb to sepsis.
With an overall mortality rate of 20 to 50%,
sepsis is the 10th leading cause of death (more
than HIV and breast cancer) in the United
States, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention. Estimates indicate
that 250,000 to 500,000 people die from
sepsis annually in the United States. Children
and the elderly are especially vulnerable to
sepsis; it is the most common cause of death
in infants and children. Childhood pneumo-
nia, often caused by virus-bacteria co-infection,
leads to septic shock and lung destruction.
This occurs after bacterial invasion even in the
presence of an appropriate antibiotic therapy.
Finding remedies to treat sepsis and diseases
associated with detrimental acute inflamma-
tory reactions is thus pivotal for humankind.
RATIONALE: We reasoned that if excessive
inflammation in response to infection leads
to lethal consequences, dampening inflam-
mation could be advantageous for the host.
At least two strategies could be used to
suppress inflammatory responses associated
with infection. One is indirect and targets
the pathogen (antibiotics). The second one,
which we used, directly acts on the host re-
sponse itself. In such a strategy, the sup-
pression of acute inflammation would bypass
the fatal outcome associated with overt in-
flammation and would “buy time” to allow
the host immune response to eliminate the
pathogen. After microbial invasion, many steps
could be targeted between the early phases
of the cellular response (sensing of the pathogen
and signal transduction) and the information
flow from DNA to RNA to proteins that act as
inflammatory mediators (i.e., cytokines). We
decided to identify and chemically inhibit
cellular factors that act at the DNA (chromatin)
level and play a primary role in activating the
expression of inflammatory genes.
RESULTS: We found that chemical inhibition
of topoisomerase 1 (Top1), an enzyme that
unwinds DNA, suppresses the expression of
infection-induced genes with little to no effect
on housekeeping gene ex-
pression and without cel-
lular damage. In vitro,
depletion or chemical inhi-
bition of Top1 in epithe-
lial cells and macrophages
suppresses the host re-
sponse against influenza and Ebola viruses as
well as bacterial products. At the mechanistic
level, as shown by chemical genetics and epi-
genetic approaches, Top1 inhibition primar-
ily suppresses RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)
activity at pathogen-associated molecular pat-
tern (PAMP)–induced genes. These genes require
SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling for activation
and display unique ge-
netic and epigenetic fea-
tures, such as the presence
of IRF3 binding sites, low
basal levels of RNAPII,
histone H3 Lys27 acetyla-
tion marks, DNA hyper-
sensitivity,andCpGislands.
This gene “signature” of
specificity was also vali-
dated using public data
sets. In vivo, Top1 inhibi-
tion therapy rescued 70
to 90% mortality caused
byexacerbated inflamma-
tion in three mouse mod-
els:acutebacteriainfection,
liver failure, and virus-
bacteria co-infection. Strik-
ingly, one to three doses of
inhibitors were sufficient for the protective
effect in all models, without overt side effects.
CONCLUSION: The inflammatory immune re-
sponse against microbes is essential in pro-
tecting us against infections. In some cases,
such as highly pathogenic and pandemic in-
fections, the organism turns against itself
and responds too acutely, with an excessive
inflammation that can have fatal consequences.
Our results suggest that a therapy based
on Top1 inhibition could save millions of
people affected by sepsis, pandemics, and
many congenital deficiencies associated with
acute inflammatory episodes and “cytokine
storms.”▪

The host innate immune response is the first line of defense against pathogens and is
orchestrated by the concerted expression of genes induced by microbial stimuli.
Deregulated expression of these genes is linked to the initiation and progression of
diseases associated with exacerbated inflammation. We identified topoisomerase 1 (Top1)
as a positive regulator of RNA polymerase II transcriptional activity at pathogen-induced
genes. Depletion or chemical inhibition of Top1 suppresses the host response against
influenza and Ebola viruses as well as bacterial products. Therapeutic pharmacological
inhibition of Top1 protected mice from death in experimental models of lethal
inflammation. Our results indicate that Top1 inhibition could be used as therapy against
life-threatening infections characterized by an acutely exacerbated immune response.
T
he innate immune response is a key defense
mechanism against infections. Activation of
innate immune cells relies on the expression
of a large family of pattern recognitionrecep-
tors (PRRs), which detect distinct conserved
microbial structures, called pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs) (1, 2). The immuno-
logical response that follows PRR downstream
signaling is then governed by the combinatorial
expression of PAMP response genes (3).
Although the function of many of the PAMP
response genes and their antiviral or inflamma-
tory activity remains elusive, their expression is
essential for the host defense against pathogens
(4). Failure in regulating the induction and post-
induction repression of these antimicrobial genes
can alter the balance between pro- and anti-
inflammatory states, often leading to detrimental
effects for the host (5–7). Indeed, hyperactivation
of antimicrobial genes has been suggested to be
responsible for the high mortality rates during
highly pathogenic infections (8, 9). Another well-
known example is the syndrome called “septic
shock,” where the uncontrolled expression of
proinflammatory genes in response to bacte-
rial PAMPs leads to severe collateral effects, such
as local and systemic tissue injury, which can
often be lethal to the host (10). In these contexts,
pharmacological inhibition of factors that con-
trol the magnitude of the innate immune response
could be useful for therapy.
Here, we show that the enzyme topoisomerase
1 (Top1) exerts an activating role on the tran-
scriptional response against infection in cells and
at the organismal level. This effect is achieved via
Top1-assisted transcriptional activation of pro-
inflammatory genes. We demonstrate that chem-
ical inhibition, as well as reduced expression of
Top1, limits the overexpression of inflammatory
genes characteristic of infection with influenza
and Ebola viruses and bacterial products. Nota-
bly, Top1 inhibition rescues mortality in mouse
models of lethal inflammation caused by over-
exposure to bacterial and viral PAMPs. Our results
suggest that Top1 inhibitors offer therapeutic ef-
ficacy for the treatment of diseases characterized
by exacerbated innate immune responses.
Topoisomerase 1 promotes PAMP-induced
gene expression
Our goal was to identify novel regulatory mecha-
nisms controlling the transcriptional response to
pathogens by the innate immune system. We
designed a reporter assay to compare the po-
tency of the transcriptional response to viral
PAMPs and its dependence on a chromatin envi-
ronment (fig. S1A). We used both the influenza A
virus strain PR8DNS1 and Sendai virus because
they are known to be strong inducers of PAMP-
mediated gene expression (fig. S1C) (11). We then
selected nine chemical inhibitors (fig. S1B) with
already known or inferred chromatin targets and
gauged their activity at various concentrations
(fig. S1C) (12–20).
Our analysis revealed that flavopiridol (FVD),
thienotriazolodiazepine [(+)-JQ1], and camptothecin
(CPT) effectively inhibit the interferon-b (IFN-b)–
driven transcription from chromatinized templates
(Fig. 1A and fig. S1C). These observations were
further reinforced by the efficacy of the three
compounds in suppressing the endogenous ex-
pression of two key PAMP-induced genes—those
encoding IFN-b and IFIT1 (IFN-induced protein
with tetratricopeptide repeats 1)—in the human
lung epithelial cell line A549 at 4 hours and
12 hours after PR8DNS1 virus infection (Fig.
1B). Notably, our analysis was performed using
all of the compounds at concentrations that do
not induce cytotoxicity in treated cells (fig. S1D).
The cellular targets of FVD, (+)-JQ1, and CPT
are P-TEFb (the inhibitor of positive transcrip-
tion elongation factor b), BET proteins (bromo-
domain and extra-terminal motif), and Top1,
respectively (20–22). P-TEFb, BET proteins, and
Top1 are ubiquitously expressed and are thought
to control basal transcriptional levels of many
genes. However, recent studies showed that
P-TEFb and BET protein inhibitors have a spe-
cific effect on genes induced by innate immune
stimuli (23) and during oncogenic transforma-
tion (24), highlighting their usage in what is
often referred to as epigenetic therapy (25).
For this reason, our observation that FVD and
(+)-JQ1 suppress PAMP-induced genes, as well
as the validation that such an effect is pheno-
copied by small interfering RNA (siRNA)–
mediated depletion of their cellular targets (fig.
S2), was not surprising. In contrast, the impact
of CPT treatment on PAMP-induced genes, al-
though previously observed (26–28), was less
expected in light of recent genome-wide ana-
lyses demonstrating that Top1 inhibition sup-
presses the expression of the majority of long
genes (>100 kb) while inducing a fraction of
smaller genes (29, 30). The inhibitory effect at
long genes is believed to be caused by Top1-
mediated resolution of topological constraints
occurring on long templates as a result of RNA
polymerase II (RNAPII) activity (29, 31). The

 activating effect is instead thought to be depen-
dent on gene-specific features such as topology,
promoter sequence, or indirect effects (30–33).
A concentration-dependent effect of the inhib-
itor CPT is also known, whereby high concen-
tration and prolonged treatment lead to DNA
damage (34).
To analyze the role of Top1 independently of
its chemical inhibition, we examined the effect of
transient Top1 depletion via siRNA. We infected
control (siCtrl) and Top1-depleted (siTop1) A549
cells with influenza PR8DNS1 virus and assessed
global differences in gene expression by micro-
array analysis (Fig. 1C, fig. S3, and table S1). Upon
infection, Top1 depletion significantly decreased
expression of 84 genes in infected cells relative to
controls (siCtrl) (Fig. 1C). Remarkably, none of
the down-regulated genes were long, but they
were highly enriched for transcripts encoding in-
flammatory cytokines and interferon-stimulated
genes (ISGs) (Fig. 1C, fig. S3, A and B, and table
S2). The expression of housekeeping genes was
unaffected independently of their level of expres-
sion (fig. S3C), indicating that Top1 depletion
does not suppress gene expression “tout court”
but predominantly affects genes induced in re-
sponse to infection. Notably, our gene knock-
down experiments rule out the possibility that
the suppression of PAMP-induced genes that we
observed is the consequence of CPT-mediated
stabilization of covalent complexes or induced
cell damage, which are known to be caused by
high dosage and prolonged chemical inhibition

 of Top1 (fig. S1D) (29). To strengthen this point,
we performed a washout experiment in the pres-
ence and absence of Top1 inhibition. As shown
in Fig. 1D, the effect of Top1 inhibition on in-
flammatory genes was fully reversible upon drug
washout, indicating the absence of any perma-
nent change or damage in treated cells.
We then performed a global proteomic analy-
sis in influenza virus–infected A549 cells in the
presence and absence of CPT treatment. Mass
spectrometry analysis indicates that the protein
levels of PAMP-induced genes were compromised
upon Top1 inhibition (Fig. 1E), as indicated by
the representative proteins DDX60L [DEAD
(Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 60-like],
IFIT3, OAS (2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthetase),
and NFBΚIE. The production of housekeeping
proteins was unaffected independently of their
expression level [Fig. 1E; low expressed, HPRT
(hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase);
high expressed, ACTB (b-actin)]. Overall, these
results indicate that Top1 is required to up-regulate
antiviral gene expression after recognition of
viral PAMPs.
Top1 controls RNAPII activity at
PAMP-induced gene loci
To confirm the specificity of Top1 activity in our
system, we first investigated whether the inhibi-
tion of PAMP-induced genes could be reproduced
using a different Top1 inhibitor. We therefore
used topotecan (TPT), an FDA-approved Top1 in-
hibitor. Our results indicate that both CPT and
TPT suppress virus-induced genes (Fig. 2A) but
not viral entry or replication (fig. S4). This was
further supported by the observed PAMP-induced
gene suppression in response to infection with
Sendai virus and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid
[poly(I:C)] treatment (fig. S5). We reproduced the
inhibitory effectof CPT andTPT on PAMP-induced
gene expression using a different cell line, the
murine macrophage RAW 264.7 (fig. S6A). Top1
inhibition did not suppress the response to other
stimuli such as estrogen signaling and heat shock,
as indicated by analysis of prototypical target
genes (fig. S7, A and B, respectively).
Furthermore, chemical inhibition and loss-of-
function experiments in A549 cells indicated
that class II topoisomerase enzymes (Top2) do
not fully phenocopy Top1 activity during PAMP-
responsive gene induction (fig. S8); along with
previous observations (29, 35, 36), this finding
suggests that inhibition of topoisomerases can
elicit both cell type–specific and gene-specific
effects. Notably, and in line with what others
have recently shown (29), neither TPT- nor CPT-
treated cells displayed DNA damage at the con-
centration we used (fig. S9).
We then characterized the genomic distribu-
tion of RNAPII and Top1 during infection in the
presence and absence of Top1 inhibition. Our
results show reduced promoter levels of RNAPII
and Top1 at PAMP-induced genes in infected
A549 cells (Fig. 2B) and macrophages (fig. S6B)
when Top1 is inhibited. Notably, RNAPII and
Top1 levels at housekeeping genes were not
reduced as a result of Top1 inhibition (Fig. 2B
and fig. S6B), consistent with their unaffected
gene expression (Fig. 2A and fig. S6A). Reduced
RNAPII targeting at PAMP-induced loci was
confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation
sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Fig. 2C) and by anal-
ysis of the RNAPII tracks at representative
PAMP-induced genes and housekeeping genes
(Fig. 2D).
To link cause (Top1 inhibition) and effect
(RNAPII levels at promoters), we devised a strat-
egy to map the genomic distribution of Top1
inhibitors via chem-ChIP, a method used to re-
veal the genomic localization of drugs (37). In
brief, we first synthesized an analog of TPT (we
did not succeed with CPT), which is amenable
for coupling with a derivative of biotin. This
compound was called TPT-alkyne (TPT-A; Fig.
2E). TPT-A synthesis and experimental strategy
are shown in fig. S10, A and B; the validation
that TPT-A is as effective as TPT is shown in fig.
S10, C and D. We then performed chem-ChIP
and analyzed the distribution of TPT-A on chro-
matin. At basal state, TPT-A was enriched at
promoters and gene bodies of active genes such
as ACTB and HPRT genes (Fig. 2F), as expected
from results showing that Top1 travels with
elongating RNAPII and that Top1 is distributed
across the genome (31, 38).
During infection, TPT-A distribution peaks at
promoters of inducible genes IFIT1 and IFIT2
(Fig. 2F) but not into gene bodies, which sug-
gests that the presence of the inhibitor does
not allow RNAPII and Top1 into productive
transcriptional cycles. Indeed, TPT-A distribu-
tion is inversely correlated with RNAPII and Top1
density only at promoters of PAMP-induced genes
(Fig. 2B). This indicates that TPT-A suppression
of Top1 activity leads to a specific inhibition of
RNAPII targeting at most PAMP-responsive loci
(Fig. 2C). These results (i) corroborate the ab-
sence of an effect of Top1 inhibition at house-
keepers, (ii) indicate that such genes can escape
the transcriptional consequences of Top1 inhibi-
tion (likely via Top2; fig. S8D), and (iii) designate
a RNAPII activator-like function for Top1 at
PAMP-induced loci.
Top1 facilitates expression of genes
that require nucleosome remodeling
for activation
Previous work has characterized how classes of
inducible genes respond temporally to induction
of Toll-like receptor (TLR; a class of PRRs) ac-
cording to genetic and epigenetic features (39–42).
These studies provide a framework for address-
ing the specificity of Top1’s effect during viral
PAMP stimulation.
We first selected the Top1-affected genes whose
expression was up-regulated by more than a
factor of 2 upon infection (Fig. 3 and table S1).
Similarly to (40), we then characterized this gene
set according to dependence on IRF3 (interferon
regulatory factor 3) and the SWI/SNF (switch/
sucrose nonfermenter)–nucleosome remodel-
ing complex for transcriptional activation. To
do so, we performed RNA interference (RNAi)–
mediated depletion of the two catalytic sub-
units of the SWI/SNF complex, SMARCA2 and
SMARCA4, before and after infection with in-
fluenza virus or IFN treatment (Fig. 3A). This
resulted in four distinct classes of Top1-affected
genes (Fig. 3B).
We found that the vast majority (75%) of genes
controlled by Top1 were dependent on SWI/SNF
nucleosome remodeling. At basal state, these
genes (relative to SWI/SNF-independent genes
and housekeeping genes) were almost devoid of
TATA-binding protein (TBP) and RNAPII, and
displayed high levels of histone H3 at their pro-
moters (Fig. 4A). These features indicate that
nucleosome remodeling at these genes precedes
recruitment of RNAPII and transcriptional initi-
ation. Upon infection, Top1-affected genes are
linked to transcriptional induction (as measured
by histone H4 acetylation; fig. S11) and to broad
expression levels, as measured by RNAPII recruit-
ment (Fig. 4A) and expression data (Fig. 4A,
inset).Inhibitionof Top1ledtodiminishedRNAPII
and TBP with a concomitant re-integration of
H3 at promoters (Fig. 4A).
Genes that require remodeling for their acti-
vation are dependent on coactivators (42) and pos-
sess unique chromatin features at basal state,
namely low levels of active histone marks, low
levels of preloaded RNAPII, and low CpG island
content (40). All these identifying features were
recapitulated in Top1-affected genes by using
genome-wide analyses and mathematical modeling
of public data sets (Fig. 4, B to D, fig. S12, and
table S3).
Top1 inhibition suppresses the
response to bacterial stimuli and
proinflammatory cytokines
To understand whether Top1 is required to acti-
vate the expression of proinflammatory genes
induced by stimuli other than viruses, we charac-
terized the effect of Top1 inhibition after expo-
sure to bacterial PAMPs and exogenous cytokines.
First, we treated both epithelial and macrophage
cell lines with the bacterial PAMP lipopolysac-
charide (LPS). Top1 inhibition suppressed the
expression of antimicrobial genes, as indicated
by the transcriptional analysis of representative
proinflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5, A and B).
Accordingly, Top1 inhibition resulted in reduced
levels of Top1 and RNAPII at promoters of the
affected genes (fig. S13, A and B).
The expression of antimicrobial genes upon
PRR stimulation induces the secretion of proin-
flammatory signals, which trigger the matura-
tion and activation of other innate immune cells
expressing the corresponding receptors (43). To
further extend our findings on cells activated via
stimulation by inflammatory cytokines, we incu-
bated both A549 and RAW cells with exogenous
IFN-b and tumor necrosis factor–a (TNF-a). We
then monitored gene expression changes, as well
as promoter levels of RNAPII and Top1, in un-
treated and Top1-inhibited cells. As shown by the
expression of multiple target genes (fig. S14, A
and B) and respective chromatin occupancies
(fig. S14, C and D), repression of Top1 activity in-
hibitedIFN-b–andTNF-a–inducedgeneexpression

sults using viral and bacterial stimuli.
Top1 protects against lethal
inflammation in vivo
Together, our data suggested that Top1 inhibition
could be an effective way to suppress the exacer-
bated response to pathogenic stimuli, prompting
us to characterize the role of Top1 inhibition in
vivo. We first analyzed whether in vivo preven-
tive inhibition of Top1 activity rescued animals
from lethal endotoxic shock. This was indeed the
case, where 90% of animals pretreated with CPT
were rescued (Fig. 5C). The protective effect of
Top1 inhibition in vivo is caused not by cellular
damage (Fig. 5, F to H) but by suppression of
inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 5, D and E).
To test the potential of Top1 inhibition therapy
in a model of bacterial disease, we infected mice
with Staphylococcus aureus, which is one of
the predominant pathogens causing nosocomial
infections and sepsis in humans (44). Our results
indicate that therapeutic treatment with CPT
allowed 70% of the mice to survive the lethal
challenge (Fig. 6A). Because the inflammatory
response against influenza is believed to be re-
sponsible for the enhanced susceptibility to pneu-
monia after secondary infection with S. aureus
in both mice and humans (45), we also tested
whether CPT treatment could reverse the out-
come of viral-bacterial co-infection. For this, mice
inoculated with the influenza virus PR8 (H1N1
PR8 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 strain) were treated
with CPT at 12, 24, and 36 hours after infection.
Three days after viral infection, mice received a
challenge with S. aureus. As shown in Fig. 6B,
CPT treatment rescued 94% of the animals from
the lethal co-infection challenge without impair-
ing the differentiation of virus-specific CD8 T cells
into IFN-g– and TNF-a–producing effector cells
(fig. S15). Strikingly, a similar protective effect
(90% rescue of mortality) was also present when
therapeutically inhibiting Top1 in an endotoxin-
induced mouse model of acute liver failure, where
the pathology is caused by high levels of secreted
cytokines such as TNF-a (Fig. 6C) (46). These data
suggest that in experimental models of lethal in-
flammation, therapeutic Top1 inhibition provides
meaningful protection at the organismal level.
Finally, because an elevated mortality rate as-
sociated with an exacerbated proinflammatory

of genes up-regulated by a factor of >2 after infection and suppressed by T
op1 inhibition in
A549 cells at 4 hours after mock treatment, infection with PR8DNS1 virus (infected), or
stimulation with exogenous IFN-b (IFNB). Cells were dual-transfected with siRNAs targeting
SMARCA2 and SMARCA4 (orange bars). SWI/SNF dependency was evaluated via transient
knockdown of SMARCA2/4, and IRF3-dependent genes were compiled from the literature
and cross-compared with a list of genes induced by IRF35D in STAT1−/− cells. (B) T
able sum-
marizing the results for genes in (A). Columns 2 and 3 show the effect of SMARCA2/4
knockdown on PR8DNS1 and exogenous interferon (IFN-b)–induced mRNA levels, respec-
tively. Levels of mRNA are shown as a percentage of the mRNA level determined by qPCR in
siCtrl-treated A549 cells (set at 100% for each gene). Column 4 classifies the genes: A and B
(21/28 genes) are SWI/SNF-dependent (inducibility levels <50%), C and D (7/28) are SWI/
SNF-independent (inducibility >50%). Color-coded legends for columns 2 and 3 are shown at
the top right. *P < 0.05 (Student’s t test with Holm-Bonferroni sequential correction). Data are

 response and clinical symptoms similar to sep-
tic shock is also observed in humans after in-
fection with highly pathogenic viruses, we focused
on Zaire ebolavirus (Ebola virus), which recent-
ly caused a large outbreak of illness with a high
fatality rate in West Africa (47). We profiled the
global gene expression response during Ebola
(wild-type strain Zaire-Mayinga) infection in
the human leukemic cell line THP-1 in the pres-
ence and absence of Top1 inhibition. Our analysis
shows that Ebola virus–induced genes encod-
ing interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-1b, and TNF are sup-
pressed by Top1 inhibition (Fig. 7 and table S4).
Overall, these data highlight a protective role
for Top1 inhibition during infections both in vitro
and in vivo.
Discussion
Topoisomerase activities are required at all genes
to resolve topological constraints that result from
RNAPII activity. Recent work (29, 30) has shown
that short and reversible Top1 inhibition specif-
ically suppresses the expression of long genes.
This indicated a differential susceptibility of
genes to Top1 inhibition and redundant Top1
activities at the promoters of housekeepers.
Our results provide evidence that during infec-
tion, short and reversible inhibition of Top1, as
well as Top1 depletion, specifically suppresses
genes induced by microbial agents. Our study

 reveals a gene-specific activator-like role for Top1.
Concordantly, such an effect was shown using
in vitro transcriptional assays (32, 33). The con-
sequence of Top1 inhibition during infection is a
suppression of RNAPII recruitment at PAMP-
induced promoters. This effect is more prom-
inent at genes with a bigger difference in the
levels of RNAPII at basal and induced states,
which explains why compromising Top1 func-
tion affects inducibility of PAMP-responsive genes.
The specificity of Top1 inhibition is then geared
toward genes that are not prone to immediate
activation but require coactivator (IRF3) assisted
nucleosome remodeling. Other gene-specific co-
transcriptional events such as the dynamics of
pause release and elongation, along with RNA
stability or transport, are likely to contribute to
PAMP gene suppression by Top1 inhibition.
At the mechanistic level, Top1 inhibitors may
create a local chromatin environment that is non-
permissive to transcription, or alternatively, could
titrate out new recruitment of Top1. Both scenar-
ios would lead to defects in RNAPII recycling and
reinitiation and would cause the observed sup-
pressive effect at pathogen-induced genes. Because
Top1 facilitates the expression of inflammato-
ry genes, Top1 depletion or chemical inhibition
during infection reduces the immune response
associated with microbial recognition. This effect
was evident in vitro by chemical inhibition of
Top1 causing suppression of both virus-induced
and inflammatory signal–induced host gene ex-
pression, and in vivo by displaying protective
effects in mouse models of lethal inflamma-
tion. The cellular response against microbes is
essential in protecting us against infection, but
its hyperactivation can have fatal consequences.
Our results suggest that a Top1 inhibition thera-
py could be useful in many instances, such as in

Materials and methods
Cell lines and viruses
The following cell lines were originally obtained
from theAmerican Type Culture Collection(ATCC):
A549 cells (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal
epithelial cells), 293T cells (human embryonic kid-
ney cells), RAW 264.7 cells (mouse leukemic mono-
cyte macrophage cell line), and HTBE cells (human
primary bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells).
The 293T-FF cell line was generated by trans-
fection with the plasmid pGL4.17-IFN-FF, en-
coding a cassette with the firefly luciferase gene
under the control of the murine IFN-b promoter,
as previously described (48), and was a gift from
P. Palese.
Cells were maintained in culture at 37°C with
5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium
(DMEM, Gibco, Life Technologies) supplemented
with 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies), 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), penicillin (100 U/ml;
Life Technologies), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml;
Gibco, Life Technologies).
The influenza virus PR8DNS1, which is the
H1N1 PR8 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 strain lacking
the expression of the NS1 protein, was propa-
gated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK)
cells expressing the viral nonstructural protein
1 (NS1) (49). The influenza virus PR8 express-
ing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (PR8-GFP)
and deficient for the viral protein hemagglutinin
(HA) was propagated in MDCK-HA–expressing
cells (50).
The influenza virus H3N2, which is the strain
A/Philippines/2/82, was propagated in 10-day-
old embryonated chicken eggs and was a gift
from F. Kramer.
The Sendai virus (SeV), Cantell strain, was prop-
agated in 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs
(51), and was a gift from P. Palese.
Viral infections using the strains described
above were performed at a multiplicity of in-
fection (MOI) of 3 and cells were analyzed at
different time points as indicated in the figures.
Infections with the Ebola virus were performed
in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line that
naturally expresses several PRRs. We used the
wild-type Ebola Zaire-Mayinga strain and its
VP-35 mutant, which fails to block the type I
interferon response in the host (52). Cells were
recovered 24 hours after Ebola infection.
IRF3 dependent genes were compiled from
the literature and cross-compared with a list
of genes induced by IRF3-5D in STAT1−/− cells
(courtesy of S. Tripathi).
Cell viability assay
The Cell Titer Glo Cell Viability Assay (Promega)
detects adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels as a
function of cell viability, and was used accord-
ing to manufacturer’s specifications. Briefly, cells
were seeded into 96-well plates (5000 cells/well),
and 18 hours later, 25 ml of fresh media containing
the indicated compounds (serially diluted) were
included. After 6 hours of incubation, 50 ml of
CellTiterGlo was added and the luminescence
was measured. Vehicle-treated cells were used to
normalize (100%) the ATP activity.
The CytoTox 96 Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity
Assay (Promega), a colorimetric assay measuring
the release of the cellular enzyme lactate dehydro-
genase (LDH), was also used according to manu-
facturer’s specifications.
Inhibitors and cell treatments
Cell culture: CPT (Sigma) was dissolved in a 4:1
mixture of chloroform and methanol at a con-
centration of 0.5 mM, heated at 55°C until fully
dissolved and then added to cells in DMEM
medium at a final concentration of 0.5 mM. TPT

dissolved in water at a concentration of 50 mM
and then added to cells in DMEM medium at
final concentrations of 0.5 and 5 mM.
All the compounds and the vehicle control
DMSO were added to the cell cultures at 1 hour
before and after stimulation or infection.
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma, tlrl-3pelps)
was added to cells in DMEM medium at a final
concentration of 100 ng/ml for 2 hours. TNF-a
(Sigma, human: T0157, mouse: T7539), IFN-b (PBL
Assay Science, human: 11415-1, mouse: 12400-1), and
poly(I:C) (Sigma, P1530) were added to cells in
DMEM medium for4 hours at final concentrations
of 10 ng/ml, 100 U/ml, and 10 mg/ml, respectively.
For hormone treatment, A549 cells were grown
in DMEM containing 5% charcoal-dextran–
treated FBS (Sigma) for 2 days before addition
of 17b-estradiol (10 nmol/liter; Sigma, E2758).
For heat shock, A549 cells were incubated at
42°C for 2 hours.
In vivo experiments: CPT was dissolved in a 4:1
mixture of chloroform and methanol, followed
by heating at 55°C until fully dissolved. CPT was
then brought up with water to the necessary vol-
ume corresponding to 200 ml per mouse and cen-
trifuged for 5 min at 4000 rpm. The top aqueous
fraction, containing the CPT, was recovered and
dissolved at a final concentration of 30 mg/kg of
mouse weight in 200 ml of water for each injection.
Immunofluorescence
A549 and RAW 264.7 cells were cultured on
cover slips overnight and then treated with 0.5
and 10 mM CPT or 100 nM and 10 mM TPT 1 hour
before and after infection with PR8DNS1 or
H3N2 viruses. At 6 hours after infection, cells
were fixed for 10 min at 4°C in 4% formaldehyde
(EMS). Cover slips were washed in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS; Life Technologies) and cells
were permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature
in 0.5% NP-40 (Sigma). Cover slips were washed
again in PBS and nonspecific binding was blocked
by incubation for 30 min at room temperature
with a solution containing 3% BSA (Sigma) in
PBS. Cells were then probed for 2 hours with a
rabbit anti-phospho-histone H2A.X antibody (Cell
Signaling), followed by detection with Alexa Fluor
488-conjugated (green) goat anti-rabbit immu-
noglobulin G (IgG) (heavy and light chain, Life
Technologies). DNA was counterstained with 4′,6-
diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Thermo Scientific).
For visualization of the PR8-GFP virus, an EVOS
FL (Thermo Scientific) microscope was used.
Quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR)
For RNA extraction, cells were homogenized
with QIAshredder columns; RNA was extracted
using the RNeasy Mini Kit and then treated with
the RNase-free DNase kit (all Qiagen). Proteins
were also simultaneously recovered from cell ly-
sates by acetone precipitation of the flow-through
from RNeasy spin columns, according to manu-
facturer’s instructions.
cDNA was in vitro transcribed using a High-
Capacity cDNA RT Kit (Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific) or a SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis
SuperMix (Life Technologies). qPCR was per-
formed using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green
One-Step Kit (Bio-Rad) according to manufac-
turer’s instructions.
The statistical significance of all pairwise com-
parisons in qPCR assays’ change in cycling thresh-
old (DCT) values was determined with a two-tailed
Student’s t test under the assumption of equal
variances between groups. We did not find sig-
nificant differences (false discovery rate, q < 0.05)
between contrast groups in Levene’s tests of
equality of variances, or departures from normal-
ity as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk tests.

Transfection with siRNA
Transfection experiments were performed using
the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX transfection re-
agents according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected with
siRNA pools (all from Dharmacon) targeting the
genes encoding human Top1, BRD4, CDK9, CCNT1,
SMARCA2, SMARCA4, TOP2A, TOP2B, or with a
control nontargeting pool, at a final concentra-
tion of 50 nM. Cells were used 48 hours after
transfection, and the efficiency of gene knockdown
was determined by qPCR or immunoblotting.
Microarray analysis
A549 cells were transfected with siRNA targeting
the gene encoding Top1 or control nontargeting
siRNA (siCtrl), then infected in triplicate with the
PR8DNS1 virus (MOI = 3). Nontransfected cells
were also infected, as a further control. RNA
was isolated from infected and uninfected cells
with a Qiagen RNeasy kit and 200 ng of RNA per
sample was then used to prepare labeled RNA
that was hybridized to Human HT-12 v4 Expres-
sion BeadChips (Illumina). Data were analyzed
using the Genespring software (version 12.5).
To determine the effect of Top1 depletion on
the magnitude of cell response during infection,
raw signal values obtained from uninfected and in-
fected cells in all siRNA treatments were quantile-
normalized before being baseline-transformed to

 the medians of signal values for the correspond-
ing uninfected siRNA-treated samples. For identi-
fication of probe sets with statistically significant
differences in magnitude of response (P < 0.01),
we conducted an analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by a post hoc [Tukey’s honest significant
difference (HSD)] test.
We selected genes differentially expressed after
treatment with siTop1 using a threshold of a
factor of ≥1.5 change (P < 0.01) in their expression
relative to siCtrl-treated cells. When indicated,
infection-induced genes were identified as the
ones showing a factor of ≥1.5 change (P < 0.01)
in their expression in infected siCtrl-treated cells
relative to uninfected siCtrl-treated cells.
All computations of P values were subjected to
multiple-testing correction using the Benjamini-
Hochberg method. For purposes of presentation,
genes represented by multiple probe sets in the
microarray were plotted in the heat maps as the
averaged values of those probe sets.
To determine the effect of Top1 depletion
under basal conditions, we normalized raw sig-
nal values from uninfected siRNA-treated cells
by quantile before baseline-transforming them
to the median of all samples. A statistical ANOVA
test followed by a post hoc test was then con-
ducted. Genes regulated by the siRNA targeting
the Top1 gene were defined as genes with a
factor of ≥1.5 change (P < 0.01) in their expres-
sion relative to the siCtrl controls. Normalized
signal intensity values of a list of canonical
housekeeping genes were also used to determine
the overall effect of the depletion of Top1 in
cells. A full list of the affected genes is shown in
table S1.
We used Ingenuity Pathways Analysis soft-
ware (Ingenuity Systems) for the identification of
canonical pathways that showed “enrichment”
among groups of genes with significant changes
in their expression by microarray analysis. The
DAVID gene ontology analysis helped to identify
genes associated with cytokine activity (53, 54). A
right-tailed Fisher’s exact test was used for
calculation of P values determining the prob-
ability that each pathway assigned to a specific
data set was due to chance alone.
Mice and related experiments
C57BL/6J female mice were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratories and housed under specific
pathogen-free conditions in the animal care facil-
ity at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount
Sinai (ISMMS). Mice were studied at 7 to 12
weeks of age. All experiments were approved by
the institutional animal care and use committee
and carried out in accordance with the Guide for
the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH
publication 86-23, revised 1985).
For the septic shock model, mice were injected
intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 mg/kg of ultra-
pure LPS (from E. coli 0111:B4 strain-TLR4 lig-
and, InvivoGen) resuspended in 200 ml of water.
For the preventive protocol, one group of mice
received, after isoflurane anesthesia, a first
retro-orbital intravenous injection with a dose of
30 mg/kg of CPT 30 min before LPS treatment
followed by an i.p. challenge with the same dose
of CPT 1 hour after LPS injection.
For the acute liver failure model, mice were
injected i.p. with a mixture of 5 mg of D-(+)-
galactosamine (Sigma) and 500 ng of ultrapure
LPS (Invivogen) (referred to as D-GalN/LPS), in
200 ml of water. One group of mice was also in-
jected i.p. with CPT (110 mg/kg) 1 hour before
(preventive protocol) or 2 hours and 30 min after
(therapeutic protocol) GalN/LPS treatment.
For the sepsis model using Staphylococcus
aureus infection (subsp. aureus Rosenbach, FDA
209P strain, ATCC) bacteria were grown in Bacto
Tryptic Soy Broth (BDbioscience) until station-
ary phase, washed, and suspended in PBS at 25 ×
108 bacteria/ml and mice intravenously injected
with 200 ml of the bacterial suspension. We then
started the treatment 3 hours after infection,
when animals presented the first clinical signs of
disease (ruffled fur, diminished activity, and
hunched posture). One group of mice received a
first dose of 30 mg/kg of CPT intravenously,
followed by IP injections of 45 mg/kg of CPT 24
and 48 hours later.
For the co-infection model, the influenza
virus PR8 (H1N1 PR8 A/Puerto Rico/8/1934)
was administered intranasally in sterile PBS
in a volume of 50 ml at a titer of 0.3 × LD50.
Three days after influenza infection, S. aureus
stocks were grown until exponential phase and
resuspended in sterile PBS in a volume of 50 ml
containing 5 × 108 bacteria per mouse for in-
tranasal administration. Mice were anesthetized
with ketamine-xylazine before all intranasal in-
jections. One group of mouse received 75 mg/kg
of CPT i.p. at 12, 24, and 36 hours after viral
infections.
Survival significance in the in vivo experi-
ments was calculated using a log-rank Mantel-
Cox test with the Graphpad software Prism.
During all treatments, mice were daily weighed
and monitored two to six times per day until the
end of the experiment. We considered a loss >20%
of the initial weight as a humane end point, ac-
cording to the policy of the institutional animal
care and use committee at ISMMS. In case of
survival, animals were under observation twice
per day for the following month and every week
for additional months. We did not detect any
side effect of the CPT treatment in mice mon-
itored for at least 3 months.
Quantitative PCR in tissue samples: Spleens
and lungs were homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol
Reagent (Life Technologies) using a mechanical
homogenizer. RNA separation and isolation were
performed using chloroform and isopropanol
(both from Sigma), respectively, according to
manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies).
cDNA synthesis and qPCR were performed as
described above.
Cytokine detection: Quantitative mRNA analy-
sis for inflammatory gene expression was con-
ducted after RNA isolation from the spleens of
untreated and CPT-treated mice 90 min after
LPS injection.
To determine the cytokine concentration dur-
ing the treatment, 50 ml of blood was collected
retro-orbitally 4 hours after LPS injection. Serum
and plasma were separated after centrifuga-
tion at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. Quantitative deter-
mination of GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a in
mouse serum was performed using a Mouse In-
flammatory Magnetic 4-Plex Panel (Novex Life
Technology), according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Data was acquired using a Luminex
100/200 plate reader.
Cell suspensions and ex vivo restimulation:
Cell suspensions were obtained after cutting the
organs into small pieces followed by 30 min in-
cubation at 37°C in DMEM containing collagen-
ase D (1 mg/ml; Roche) and DNase (20 mg/ml;
Roche). Tissue suspensions were then filtered
through a 70-mm cell strainer (BD Falcon), and
red blood cells were lysed using 1 ml of RBC
Lysis Buffer (Affymetrix eBioscience).
For surface staining, cells were suspended in
PBS containing 2% FBS, anti-mouse CD16/32
(Biolegend) and 0.1% NaN3. For intracellular
staining, cells were fixed in Fixation/Permeabili-
zation buffer (eBioscience) and stained in Perm/
Wash buffer (eBioscience).
For antigen-specific restimulation, cells were
resuspended in complete [i.e., supplemented with
10% FBS, penicillin (100 mg/ml), streptomycin
(100 mg/ml), and 1 nM sodium pyruvate] DMEM
(Sigma) and restimulated with 100 nM peptide
ASNENMETM derived from viral A/PR8/34 nucleo-
protein (NP, 366 to 374 amino acids) (MBL) in
the presence of Brefeldin A (Biolegend), and in-
cubated for 6 hours at 37°C.
All antibodies were purchased from Biole-
gend: anti-mouse CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD11c
(N418), CD11b (M1/70), Ly6C (HK 4.1), CD69
(H1.2F3), MHC-II (M5/114.15.2), CD8b (Ly-3),
CD44 (IM7), CD3e (17Α2), CD45 (30-F11), TNF-a
(ΜP6-XT22), IFN-g (XMG1.2). Dead cells were
discriminated using the Zombie Aqua Fixable
Viability Kit (Biolegend), referred to as Life/
Death dye.
Acquisition of stained cells was made with a
BD LSRII flow cytometer (BD Bioscience); data
were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar).
Antibodies and immunoblotting
Antibodies used were as follows: anti–b-actin
(3700; Cell Signaling); anti-TOP2A (ab52934;
Abcam), anti-TOP2B (ab58442; Abcam), anti-
TOP1(A302-589A;Bethyl), anti-FLAG-HRP(A8592;
Sigma). Gradient gels were used according to the
molecular weight of the proteins to be evaluated,
followed by wet transfer on polyvinylidene
fluoride membranes.
ChIP
The following antibodies were used: anti-
RNAPII (clone 8WG16; Covance/BioLegend),
anti–topoisomerase I (TOP1) (rabbit polyclonal
anti-human IgG; Bethyl Laboratories; rabbit
polyclonal anti-human/mouse serum; Abcam),
anti–histone H3 (rabbit polyclonal IgG; Abcam),
anti–TATA binding protein (rabbit polyclonal
antiserum; Abcam), and anti–histone H4ac (rab-
bit polyclonal anti-human/mouse serum; Active
Motif).

 ChIP experiments were conducted as de-
scribed (55). For experiments with ChIP followed
by qPCR, cross-linking was performed for 10 min.
For sonication, we used a refrigerated Bioruptor
(Diagenode), which we optimized to generate DNA
fragments of approximately 200 to 1000 base pairs
(bp). Lysates were precleared for 3 hours using
the appropriate isotype-matched control antibody
(rabbit IgG; Cell Signaling) or anti-mouse IgG
(Cell Signaling). The specific antibodies were
coupled with magnetic paramagnetic beads
(Dynabeads M-280 sheep anti-mouse IgG; Thermo-
Fisher Scientific) bound to anti-mouse IgG or anti-
rabbit IgG for 6 hours. Antibody-bound beads
and chromatin were then immune-precipitated
overnight at 4°C with rotation. After washing,
reverse crosslinking was carried out overnight at
65°C. After digestion with RNase and proteinase
K (Roche), DNA was isolated with a MinElute kit
(Qiagen) and used for downstream applications.
The statistical significance of ChIP qPCR analysis
was determined with a two-tailed Student’s paired
t test.
ChIP-seq sample preparation
and sequencing
After sonication (Bioruptor Pico, Diagenode),
input and IP samples were analyzed on an Agilent
Bioanalyzer (DNA High Sensitivity kit) to confirm
that the fragment distributions were within the
expected size range. Sheared Input and ChIP
DNA samples were then end-repaired using
NEBNext End Repair Module (New England
BioLabs) and cleaned up using 1.5× AMPure
XP beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions, except for the final
elution step, which we omitted. Next, A-tailing
was done on beads using the NEBNext dA-
Tailing Module (New England BioLabs), followed
by addition of 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG)/
NaCl in a 1.5× ratio to AMPure XP bead cleanup,
again omitting the final elution step. Adaptor
ligation was performed using the NEBNext Quick
Ligation Module (New England BioLabs) and
80 mM DNA Multiplex Adaptor. Then, 20% PEG/
NaCl was added in a 1.5× ratio followed by the
AMPure XP cleanup. Samples were then eluted
from beads and split into two aliquots. Each aliquot
was amplified for 28 cycles using KAPA HiFi
HotStart ReadyMix PCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems),
25 mM PE forward primer, and 25 mM indexed
reverse primer. PCR reactions were cleaned using
1.5× of the AMPure XP beads according to the
manufacturer’s protocol and selected on the basis
of fragments with a size of 250 to 500 nucleotides
on the BluePippin platform using 2% M1 Marker
gels. Size selected libraries were cleaned using
1.8× of the AMPure XP beads and sequenced on
the HiSEq 2500 platform in a 100-nucleotide
single-end read format.
Adapters used for ligation: Adapter1, 5′ P-
GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT; Adapter2, 5′ AC-
ACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATC*T
(* = phosphorothioate).
Barcode PCR primers: 5′AATGATACGGCGA-
CCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGAC-
GCTCTTCCGATC*T, 5′CAAGCAGAAGACGGC-
ATACGAGAT[NNNNNN]GTGACTGGAGTTCA-
GACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATC*T (where N cor-
responds to the barcode sequences used).
ChIP-seq data processing
ChIP-seq reads were trimmed for adapter se-
quences using “cutadapt.” Reads were then
filtered using “sickle” with a minimum quality
threshold of 20 and retaining only sequences
containing at least 20 bases. QC-filtered reads
were then aligned against the human reference
genome (GRCh37) using STAR, selecting only
nonambiguous alignments and allowing up to
five mismatches for each alignment. The resulting
BAM files were processed using the R package
“Pasha” with default parameters in order to ex-
clude artifactual enrichments, estimate fragments
elongation, and prepare genome-wide read cov-
erage tracks in variable-step WIG format. WIG
scores were finally rescaled for each sample by
dividing all values by the average genome wide
enrichment value.
Average profile computation: The average
read coverage for selected genes was calculated
across the annotated gene regions, including
2-kb flanking regions. For each gene, coverage in
flanking regions was sampled across 167 equally
spaced bins, and the resulting values were aver-
aged across the upstream and downstream
regions of all selected genes. Coverage across
the annotated region of each gene was calculated
in 666 equally spaced bins within the annotated
start and end coordinates, and the resulting
vectors were averaged across all genes and com-
bined with the gene-flanking regions to create a
composite average profile of 1000 points, cover-
ing selected annotations and 2 kb of each flanking
region. All average profiles were normalized
based on the average ChIP signal across the third
quartile (i.e., last 50 to 75%) of the gene body of
active genes [previously identified by Gro-seq
profiling (56)], to account for differences in ChIP
efficiency between experiments.
Chemical synthesis of TPT-A
An alkyne group was introduced to the 10-
hydroxyl group of TPT through a Mitsunobu
reaction (57), as the 10-hydroxyl of TPT does not
contribute to the binding between human top-
oisomerase I covalently joined to double-stranded
DNA and TPT [according to the reported x-ray
crystal structure (58)]. TPT hydrochloride was
dissolved in distilled water and further neutral-
ized by adding (dropwise) a saturated solution
of sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) until the pH
reached 9 to 10. Hydrochloride-free TPT was
extracted from this solution by washing the
aqueous phase with dichloromethane (DCM)
three times, combining the organic phase, drying
it by incubation with sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) for
1 hour, and finally evaporating DCM under re-
duced pressure. The TPT was then fully dissolved
together with 5 equiv of triphenylphospine (Ph3P)
and 5 equiv of propargyl alcohol in a small
volume of anhydrous tetrahydrofuran (THF).
Five equiv of diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD)
was then added dropwise into the solution. The
reaction was monitored using thin-layer chroma-
tography (TLC). The reaction time was 2 hours
at room temperature. The solvents were re-
moved by using a rotary evaporator (Rotovap).
The product was purified by applying prepar-
ative HPLC with a gradient elution consist-
ing of methanol (MeOH) and H2O. Purity was
≥ 95%, and the rude yield was 74%. 1HNMR

and 919.3667, respectively; 460.2103 and 919.3643
were found in HRMS (59). All chemical reagents
and solvents were commercially purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich.
Chem-ChIP
A549 cells (108 cells per condition) were pre-
treated for 1 hour with 100 nM TPT-A or DMSO,
infected with influenza PR8DNS1 virus, and, at
1 hour after infection, treated again with TPT-A
or DMSO. Cells were collected 6 hours after
infection and treated as described above for the
ChIP procedure. Sonicated DNA fragments for
each condition were separated into 500-ml ali-
quots. The following reagents were added se-
quentially with vortexing after each addition:
11.3 ml of 5 mM biotin-azide (final concentration:
100 mM), 11.3 ml of 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)
phosphine (TCEP, final concentration: 1 mM),
34 ml of 1.7 mM tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl) amine
(TBTA, final concentration: 100 mM), and 11.3 ml
of 50 mM copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate
(CuSO4·5H2O, final concentration: 1 mM). These
mixtures were then incubated at room temper-
ature for 1 hour, with vortexing after the first
30 min. Chromatin aliquots were combined
and centrifuged for 5 min at 6500g at 4°C. The
supernatant was then removed for downstream
immunoprecipitation. ChIP qPCR was performed
as described above. The statistical significance of
ChIP qPCR analysis was determined with a two-
tailed Student’s paired t test.
Stranded RNA sequencing
and data analysis
RNA (1 mg) was treated using the Ribo-Zero
Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Human/Mouse/Rat,
Illumina), and purified post-depletion with 1.6×
ratio of AMPureXP beads. Directional RNA li-
braries were prepared using NEBNext Ultra
Directional RNA library prep kit for Illumina
(New England BioLabs), according to manu-
facturer’s instructions. Fragment size distribu-
tion and concentration of the PCR-amplified
libraries were assessed using the Qubit and the
Agilent Bioanalyzer. Finally, samples were se-
quenced on the HiSEq 2500 platform in a 100-bp
single-end read format.
After adapter removal with cutadapt and
base quality trimming to remove 3′ ends if
more than 20 bases with Q < 20 were present,
reads were mapped to the human (hg19) and

Downloaded from 
 Ebola virus (H.sapiens-tc/COD/1976/Yambuku-
Mayinga, NC_002549) reference genomes using
STAR (60), and gene and transcript count
summaries were generated using Featurecounts
(61). Read counts were then combined into a
numeric matrix, with genes in rows and ex-
periments in columns, and used as input for
differential gene expression analysis with the
Bioconductor edgeR package (62). Normaliza-
tion factors were computed using the weighted
trimmed mean of M-values (TMM), and dis-
persions (common, trended, and tagwise) were
estimated before fitting a negative binomial
general linearized model that accounted for ex-
perimental conditions with two biological rep-
licates each. Finally, a likelihood ratio test was
carried against selected contrasts. P values were
corrected for multiple testing using the Benjamin-
Hochberg (BH) method and used to select genes
with significant expression differences (q < 0.05).
Proteomic analysis
A549 cells were treated with CPT or DMSO and
infected with the influenza PR8DNS1 virus as
described above, collected 6 hours after infection,
washed three times with PBS [including protease
inhibitors (Roche)], then frozen as cell pellets.
These pellets were sent to Bioproximity LLC,
where global proteomic profiling was acquired
using ultraperformance liquid chromatography
and tandem mass spectrometry.
For the analysis of mass spectrometry “hits,”
initial thresholds were calculated in duplicate
experiments for protein abundances in both
DMSO- and CPT-treated uninfected cells. Next,
protein abundances were calculated in the re-
spective infected conditions and normalized using
noninfected abundances. We considered up-
regulated hits as having a normalized unique
protein score above 5 in the DMSO-treated, in-
fected cells. The statistical comparison between
normalized infectedidentificationswas determined
with a two-tailed Student’s t test under the as-
sumption of equal variances between groups.
Transcription factor promoter
enrichment analysis
Identification of transcription factors (TFs) reg-
ulating the genes affected by Top1 depletion was
performed using a computational method that
overlaps the genomic coordinates of a set of gene
promoters with a large library of TF-genome
interactions. We created the ChIP-seq library by
compiling 1630 human ChIP-seq data sets from
a variety of sources, including ENCODE (63),
Cistrome (64), PAZAR (65), and Re-Map (66). As
input, we took a set of genomic regions of
interest (e.g., promoters of genes whose expres-
sion changes upon silencing of Top1) that we
systematically overlapped with each ChIP-seq
data set, and we counted the number of input
regions overlapped by at least one base.
Next, a P value describing the significance of
this overlap was estimated using a simulation-
based procedure: A distribution of expected over-
lap values was created from 1000 iterations of
randomly choosing RefSeq gene promoters with
the same length as the input set (as an example,
for 50 promoters of length 100 bp as input, 50
randomly chosen promoters of length 100 bp
were used in each simulation). The distribution
of the expected overlap values from the random-
ized data resembled a normal distribution and
was used to generate a Z-score and P value esti-
mating the significance of the observed number
of input regions that overlapped each ChIP-seq
data set. We obtained a ranked list of TFs, based
on experimentally-determined binding sites lo-
cated in the promoters of each gene set. We
applied this procedure to each input gene list
using three different promoter definitions, (–100,
+1), (–1000, +1), and (–10,000, +1), relative to the
transcription start site. Results were similar
regardless of promoter length (table S3). We fur-
ther annotated the results with TF binding site
motif enrichment scores (using the same promoter
definitions). For this, we used the HOMER motif
enrichment algorithm (67) and a large library of
humanposition weight matrices obtainedfrom the
CisBP database (68).
Mapping
ChIP-seq data from this study and publicly
available data from ENCODE for DNase-seq
(GSE26328) and histone H3 Lys27 acetylation
(H3K27ac; GSE29611) in A549 cells were aligned
to the human genome (hg19/GRCh37) using
Bowtie2 with default parameters (69). Only reads
that mapped to unique genomic positions were
considered for downstream analysis. Normalized
promoter ChIP-seq read densities were calcu-
lated using HOMER (http://homer.salk.edu) by
counting the total number of reads per 107
aligned reads from each experiment found from
–500 to +500 bp relative to the representative
RefSeq defined transcription start site (TSS) for
each gene (67). META gene plots were compiled
by calculating ChIP-seq read densities along RefSeq
gene bodies (>3 kb in length) using HOMER.
CpG Island promoters were defined by RefSeq
TSS found within 200 bp of an annotated CpG
Island (70). IFN-stimulated response elements
(ISREs) containing promoters were defined by
searching for ISRE motifs from –500 to +100
relative to the TSS using HOMER.
