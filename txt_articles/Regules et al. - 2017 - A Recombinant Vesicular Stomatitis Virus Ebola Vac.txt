Abstract
Background—The worst Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in history has resulted in more 
than 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. We present the final results of two phase 1 trials of an 
attenuated, replication-competent, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)–based vaccine 
candidate designed to prevent EVD.
Methods—We conducted two phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation trials of 
an rVSV-based vaccine candidate expressing the glycoprotein of a Zaire strain of Ebola virus 
(ZEBOV). A total of 39 adults at each site (78 participants in all) were consecutively enrolled into 
groups of 13. At each site, volunteers received one of three doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (3 
million plaque-forming units [PFU], 20 million PFU, or 100 million PFU) or placebo. Volunteers 
at one of the sites received a second dose at day 28. Safety and immunogenicity were assessed.
Results—The most common adverse events were injection-site pain, fatigue, myalgia, and 
headache. Transient rVSV viremia was noted in all the vaccine recipients after dose 1. The rates of 
adverse events and viremia were lower after the second dose than after the first dose. By day 28, 
all the vaccine recipients had seroconversion as assessed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) against the glycoprotein of the ZEBOV-Kikwit strain. At day 28, geometric mean 
titers of antibodies against ZEBOV glycoprotein were higher in the groups that received 20 million 
PFU or 100 million PFU than in the group that received 3 million PFU, as assessed by ELISA and 
by pseudovirion neutralization assay. A second dose at 28 days after dose 1 significantly increased 
antibody titers at day 56, but the effect was diminished at 6 months.
Conclusions—This Ebola vaccine candidate elicited anti-Ebola antibody responses. After 
vaccination, rVSV viremia occurred frequently but was transient. These results support further

second dose may boost antibody responses. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and

The worst Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in recorded history has resulted in more than 
28,000 cases and 11,000 reported deaths.1 Although the primary strategy to stop the 
transmission of Ebola remains the identification and isolation of contacts and the use of 
appropriate personal protective equipment, the development of a safe and efficacious vaccine 
would provide an important public health tool. Numerous Ebola virus vaccine candidates are 
in preclinical development, and some have proceeded to human trials.2-5
An Ebola virus vaccine candidate based on an attenuated, replication-competent, 
recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) has shown promise in preclinical studies. The 
vaccine candidate (rVSV-ZEBOV) is genetically engineered to replace the VSV 
glycoprotein with the glycoprotein from a Zaire strain of Ebola virus (ZEBOV). Vaccination 
induces replication of viral particles similar to VSV but expressing the ZEBOV surface 
glycoprotein. ZEBOV glycoprotein is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion 
between ZEBOV and host target cells and the induction of functional antibodies, including 
neutralizing antibodies.6
Preclinical testing of rVSV-ZEBOV supports its potential efficacy. The rVSV-ZEBOV 
vaccine has been shown to be attenuated in normal and immunocompromised nonhuman 
primates in safety and immunogenicity studies.7, 8 Multiple studies in cynomolgus macaques 
have shown that a single administration of the vaccine confers a high level of protection 
against lethal challenge.9,10 Various methods of vaccine delivery (oral, intranasal, or 
intramuscular) have shown protective efficacy in animal models.11
On the basis of this preclinical experience, we conducted phase 1, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, dose-escalation studies of rVSV-ZEBOV at two locations in the United States: 
the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research (WRAIR), in Silver Spring, Maryland, and the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center, in Bethesda, Maryland. Although the 
studies were designed as two independent studies, the assessments and data collections were 
largely harmonized. The WRAIR evaluated a single-dose strategy, whereas the NIH 
evaluated a homologous, two-dose regimen administered at study days 0 and 28. Safety and 
humoral-immunogenicity data through day 180 after vaccination, generated by the same 
laboratories for both trials, are presented here for the three vaccine dose levels (3 million 
plaque-forming units [PFU], 20 million PFU, and 100 million PFU) that were under 
consideration for human use. On the basis of the data presented here and additional clinical 
and preclinical data, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine (at the dose of 20 million PFU) was selected 
for inclusion in the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL) trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02344407), a phase 3 efficacy study in Guinea,12 and the 
phase 3 Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE, NCT02378753).

 Methods
Vaccine
The rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate is a live attenuated recombinant virus consisting of the 
VSV strain Indiana, with the glycoprotein of the ZEBOV Kikwit 1995 strain replacing the 
gene for the VSV envelope glycoprotein. The resultant rVSV construct contains surface 
ZEBOV glycoprotein that exhibits a narrower host-cell tropism in vitro than wild-type VSV, 
as well as considerable attenuation of replication.13 A 2015 analysis estimated a 3.4% 
nucleotide divergence (approximately 1.6% amino acid divergence) between the ZEBOV 
Kikwit 1995 strain and a limited number of genomic sequences for the currently circulating 
strain,14 although no conclusions regarding the effect on immunogenicity can be made.
The vaccine was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada, licensed to 
BioProtection Systems (NewLink Genetics), and most recently sublicensed to Merck, which 
is responsible for ongoing research and development. The sponsor of the investigational new 
drug (IND) application, BioProtection Systems, was involved in discussions of the study 
design and in the study monitoring and statistical analysis; it also provided the vaccine 
candidate. The vaccine, which was manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing 
Practices, was formulated with recombinant human serum albumin and 
tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer and was dispensed in a vial containing 100 million 
PFU per milliliter (lot number 003 05 13). Normal saline was used as a diluent by the study 
pharmacists to formulate the doses of 3 million PFU or 20 million PFU.
Volunteers and Study Design
Both trials were phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trials. The trials 
were designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of rVSV-ZEBOV 
across three dose levels: 3 million PFU, 20 million PFU, and 100 million PFU. A total of 78 
healthy adult men and women from the Washington, D.C.–Balti-more metropolitan area 
were recruited according to protocols that were approved by the institutional review board at 
each site. Written informed consent was obtained from all the volunteers before enrollment. 
Exclusion criteria were active involvement in clinical care of patients; substantial contact 
with immunocompromised populations, children 5 years of age or younger, or animals at 
risk for VSV infection; and a history of infection with filoviruses or VSV, predisposition for 
exposure to filoviruses or VSV, or previous receipt of a filovirus vaccine or VSV-vectored 
vaccine. Pregnant or lactating women and persons found to have the human 
immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B or C virus infection, or clinically significant medical 
conditions at screening were excluded.
Study Procedures
A total of 39 adults at each site were consecutively enrolled into groups of 13 each. In each 
group, 3 volunteers were randomly assigned in a blinded manner to receive the control 
(saline placebo), and 10 were assigned to receive the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine at a dose of 3 
million PFU, 20 million PFU, or 100 million PFU. Each participant received a 1-ml 
injection in the deltoid muscle; at the NIH site, a second identical dose was administered 28 
days after the first. Volunteers were assessed on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after the first and (if

 applicable) second injection. Data on solicited adverse events related to injection-site and 
systemic reactogenicity were collected for 14 days after each injection. Data on unsolicited 
adverse events, changes in medical status, and concomitant medication use were collected 
for 28 days after each injection. Blood samples were obtained for assessment of safety and 
immunologic end points. All the volunteers had safety laboratory evaluations (including a 
complete blood count with differential; measurements of serum creatinine, alanine 
aminotrans-ferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels; determination of the prothrombin 
time and partial-thromboplastin time; and urinalysis [red-cell count and levels of protein and 
glucose]) at baseline and 7 days and 28 days after each injection. In addition, the WRAIR 
site evaluated these laboratory variables 1 day and 3 days after injection. Grading of adverse 
events was based on Food and Drug Administration toxicity grading.15 Positivity for vaccine 
ZEBOV-glycoprotein nucleic acid sequences was assessed in plasma, saliva, and urine. At 
the WRAIR, samples were obtained before the injection and on days 1, 3, 7, and 14 after the 
injection. At the NIH site, specimens were obtained on days 3 and 7 after each injection. 
Further details are available in the trial protocols, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.
rVSV-ZEBOV Surveillance by RT-PCR
A reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to measure 
potential rVSV virus in the plasma, saliva, and urine, through amplification of the Ebola 
Zaire glycoprotein gene insert of the vaccine. The assay was performed at the WRAIR. 
Details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Measurement of Antibody Responses to Ebola Glycoprotein
The primary assays for antibody response were an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) against the homologous Zaire–Kikwit strain glycoprotein and a pseudovirion 
neutralization assay (PsVNA) against the homologous Zaire–Kikwit strain glycoprotein. 
These assays were performed at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious 
Diseases (see the Methods section of the Supplementary Appendix). A limited number of 
samples were also tested with the use of an ELISA against the Zaire–Mayinga strain 
glycoprotein at the Vaccine Research Center of the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, with the use of methods described previously,16 to allow cross-vaccine 
comparisons of immunogenicity.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with the use of R software, version 3.3.1. For each 
serologic variable, data were summarized by assessment day and included the geometric 
mean titer and 95% confidence interval, the median value, and minimum and maximum 
values. A two-sample t-test was performed for comparison of geometric mean titers between 
dose levels and study sites. A paired t-test was used for comparisons between time points 
within a dose level. All calculations and comparisons of geometric mean titers were 
performed on the log10 scale.
A positive response for the Kikwit strain ELISA was defined as a titer of 50 or more, with 
titers of less than 50 assigned values of 25 for calculation. A positive response for the

 PsVNA was defined as a titer of 20 or more, with titers of less than 20 assigned values of 10 
for calculation. Seroconversion on these assays was defined as a quadrupling of the titer over 
the baseline value. Baseline values were subtracted from the postvaccination values for 
determination of the Mayinga strain ELISA titers, as described previously.3,4
Results
Study Participants
A total of 78 volunteers (55 men [71%] and 23 women [29%]), with a mean age of 36 years 
(range, 20 to 64), were enrolled in a consecutive manner; injections were administered 
between October 10, 2014, and January 6, 2015. A total of 60 volunteers were randomly 
assigned to receive rVSV-ZEBOV, and 18 volunteers were randomly assigned to receive 
saline placebo. At the NIH site, all the participants received a second identical dose of 
vaccine 28 days after the initial dose. All the volunteers completed the follow-up visits that 
were scheduled during the 28-day windows after vaccination; however, 4 volunteers were 
lost to follow-up by the conclusion of the trial (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Additional details regarding the demographic characteristics of the volunteers are provided 
in Table 1.
Safety
There were no deaths, serious adverse events, or adverse events resulting in withdrawal from 
the study. There was no association between vaccine dose and the frequency or severity of 
adverse events (Fig. 1, and Figs. S2 and S3 and Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
After a single inoculation of vaccine, mild-to-moderate injection-site pain was observed in 
the majority of participants. Systemic reactogenicity was transient and, in the majority of 
volunteers, mild to moderate in severity. Objective fever was noted in 20 of the 60 vaccinees: 
11 (18%) had grade 1 fever (temperature range, 38.0 to 38.4°C), 7 (12%) had grade 2 fever 
(temperature range, 38.5 to 38.9°C), and 2 (3%) had grade 3 fever (temperature range, 39.0 
to 40.0°C). Fever onset and frequency did not appear to be dose-dependent (Fig. 1, and Fig. 
S2 in the Supplementary Appendix); fever typically developed 12 to 24 hours after 
vaccination and resolved by the end of postvaccination day 1. One volunteer who received a 
dose of 3 million PFU had grade 1 fever 7 days after vaccination that resolved within 24 
hours without development of other symptoms.
Other commonly reported systemic symptoms among vaccinees were headache, myalgia, 
and fatigue, with typical onset 12 to 24 hours after vaccination. Notable adverse events were 
unilateral conjunctivitis that developed in one volunteer 1 day after inoculation and oral 
ulcers that developed in five vaccinated volunteers 4 to 16 days after vaccination. PCR 
analysis of swabs of the affected areas (a conjunctival swab and swabs of three of the five 
oral ulcers) was negative for the Ebola glycoprotein gene insert. Three vaccinated 
participants had cervical lymphadenopathy; one of the three also reported an oral ulcer. 
Infectious colitis developed in one participant 21 days after vaccination; symptoms included 
severe abdominal pain on the left side and four episodes of mild diarrhea with blood. 
Computed tomography of the abdomen at an outside hospital showed mild thickening of the 
descending colon. All conditions resolved without complications. Among participants who

 received a second dose of the vaccine, reactogenicity at the injection site and systemic 
reactogenicity were less severe after the second dose than after the first dose. A complete list 
of solicited and unsolicited adverse events is provided in Table S10 in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Safety laboratory values were generally unremarkable, with the majority of adverse events 
occurring after the first dose of vaccine. Transient mild-to-moderate lymphopenia occurred 
in 24 of 60 participants, typically on day 1, with abatement by day 3 after vaccination. Mild-
to-moderate neutropenia, which occurred in 14 of 60 participants, was most notable on day 3 
after vaccination and typically abated within 2 to 4 days. An asymptomatic grade 2 
thrombocytopenia, associated with grade 1 lymphopenia, was noted on day 1 after 
vaccination in one volunteer who received a dose of 20 million PFU; the condition resolved 
by day 7.
After a report from a phase 1 study in Geneva of the onset of arthritis in 22% of the 
participants starting the second week after injection,17,18 volunteers were specifically 
queried about the development of new arthralgia, arthritis, or rash during the second week or 
later after vaccination. A total of 19 participants reported arthralgia, typically soon after 
vaccination. Five participants had an onset of arthralgia 7 to 14 days after vaccination, and 3 
participants had arthralgia that began after the second vaccination. No clinical cases of 
arthritis were diagnosed.
rVSV-ZEBOV on PCR Assay
PCR results are shown in Table 2. All the vaccinated volunteers had detectable vaccine 
viremia at the first visit after vaccination (day 1 at the WRAIR and day 3 at the NIH). 
Twelve of the 60 vaccinated volunteers (20%) had viremia on day 7 after vaccination. 
Viremia was undetectable by day 14 in all vaccinees tested at that time point (30 volunteers 
at the WRAIR). In the group that received a dose of 3 million PFU, there was one positive 
urine sample on day 3 and one on day 7. Across the vaccine groups, a small number of saliva 
samples were PCR-positive on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Two subsequent saliva samples were 
PCR-negative in the single volunteer who had a positive PCR saliva sample on day 14. 
Cycle-threshold values for the positive urine sample on day 7 and saliva sample on day 14 
were near the lower limit of detection for the assay.
After administration of a second vaccine dose at the NIH site, a single volunteer in the group 
that received a dose of 100 million PFU had viremia 3 days later. PCR results were 
otherwise negative in blood, urine, and saliva.
ELISA for Ebola Glycoprotein
ELISA results are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3, and Tables S1 through S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. After a single dose of vaccine, IgG responses were observed. A 
total of 16 of 20 volunteers (80%) who received a dose of 3 million PFU, 19 of 20 
volunteers (95%) who received a dose of 20 million PFU, and 18 of 20 who received a dose 
of 100 million PFU had undergone seroconversion by day 14. All 60 vaccinated volunteers 
(100%) had undergone seroconversion by day 28. The groups that received a dose of 20 
million PFU or 100 million PFU had higher geometric titers against the Zaire–Kikwit strain

 than the group that received a dose of 3 million PFU, both on day 14 (857 and 888 vs. 283; P 
= 0.008 and P = 0.02, respectively) and on day 28 (4079 and 4079 vs. 1300; P = 0.001 and 
P<0.001, respectively). All vaccinated cohorts showed increases in titers from day 14 to day 
28; titers increased from 283 on day 14 to 1300 on day 28 in the group receiving a dose of 3 
million PFU (P<0.001), from 857 to 4079 in the group receiving a dose of 20 million PFU 
(P<0.001), and from 888 to 4079 in the group receiving a dose of 100 million PFU (P = 
0.01)). There was no significant difference in the geometric mean titer between the group 
that received a dose of 20 million PFU and the group that received a dose of 100 million 
PFU.
At day 28, there were no significant differences in the geometric mean titer between the 
groups that were to receive a second vaccine dose and those that were not. All three groups 
that received a second dose had increases in titers from day 28 to day 56; titers increased 
from 1300 on day 28 to 4222 on day 56 in the group that received a dose of 3 million PFU 
(P<0.001), from 5198 to 7352 in the group that received a dose of 20 million PFU (P = 
0.27), and from 3676 to 11,143 in the group that received a dose of 100 million PFU 
(P<0.001). Among participants who received a second dose, the geometric mean titer was 
higher at day 84 than at day 28 in the group that received a dose of 3 million PFU (1300 at 
day 28 vs. 2986 at day 84 [P = 0.02]) and in the group that received a dose of 100 PFU 
(3676 at day 28 vs. 7352 at day 84 [P = 0.02]). Among participants who did not receive a 
second dose, only the group that received a dose of 3 million PFU had significant increases 
in the geometric mean titer from day 28 through day 84 (1300 at day 28 vs. 2599 at day 56 
[P<0.001] and 1300 at day 28 vs. 2263 at day 84 [P = 0.003]). In all three vaccinated groups, 
participants who received a second vaccination had higher geometric mean titers on day 56 
than those who did not (4222 vs. 2599 in the group that received a dose of 3 million PFU [P 
= 0.16], 7352 vs. 3733 in the group that received a dose of 20 million PFU [P = 0.04], and 
11,143 vs. 4525 in the group that received a dose of 100 million PFU [P = 0.04]). At the 
180-day follow-up, there was no significant difference in geometric mean titers between the 
groups that received a second dose of vaccine and the groups that received a single dose.
PSVNA Titers
Results with respect to neutralizing antibody titers against the Zaire–Kikwit strain 
glycoprotein are shown in Figure 2 and Table 3, and Table S5 through S8 in the 
Supplementary Appendix. After a single vaccination, all groups had neutralizing antibodies 
by day 28, in a dose-dependent manner. The geometric mean titer in the group that received 
a dose of 100 million PFU was significantly higher than in the group that received a dose of 
3 million PFU both on day 14 (127 vs. 39 [P = 0.004]) and on day 28 (461 vs. 223 [P = 
0.01]). All three dose groups had significant increases in the geometric mean titer from day 
14 to day 28; the titer increased from 39 on day 14 to 223 on day 28 in the group that 
received a dose of 3 million PFU (P<0.001), from 47 to 441 in the group that received a dose 
of 20 million PFU (P<0.001), and from 127 to 461 in the group that received a dose of 100 
million PFU (P<0.001).
At day 28, there were no significant differences in the geometric mean titer between the 
groups that were to receive a second vaccine dose and those that were not. Groups that

 received a second dose of vaccine had an initial trend of increased geometric mean titers 
during the month after revaccination (222 at day 28 vs. 344 at day 56 in the group that 
received a dose of 3 million PFU [P = 0.08], 415 vs. 653 in the group that received a dose of 
20 million PFU [P = 0.33], and 476 vs. 669 in the group that received a dose of 100 million 
PFU [P = 0.19]). However, this trend was reversed in titers measured 2 months after 
revaccination (222 at day 28 vs. 33 at day 84 in the group that received a dose of 3 million 
PFU [P<0.001], 415 vs. 47 in the group that received a dose of 20 million PFU [P = 0.003], 
and 476 vs. 90 in the group that received a dose of 100 million PFU [P<0.001]). Vaccine 
groups that did not receive a second dose had a decrease in neutralizing antibody responses 
from day 28 to 56 (223 vs. 138 in the group that received a dose of 3 million PFU [P = 0.06], 
468 vs. 170 in the group that received a dose of 20 million PFU [P = 0.008], and 447 vs. 219 
in the group that received a dose of 100 million PFU [P = 0.02]). At the 180-day follow-up, 
there was no significant difference in neutralizing antibody responses between the groups 
that received a second dose of vaccine and the groups that received a single dose.
Discussion
Both a single and a second administration of the rVSV-ZEBOV Ebola vaccine candidate 
elicited an antibody response without any safety concerns being identified. In 60 healthy 
adults, the vaccine candidate had an acceptable safety profile across all dose concentrations. 
The most common side effects were injection-site pain, myalgia, fatigue, headache, 
subjective fever, and chills. Immunogenicity as measured by means of IgG ELISA was 
concordant with antibody responses measured with the use of a functional (neutralization) 
assay, and the IgG ELISA results suggested a dose response, especially between the group 
receiving a dose of 3 million PFU and the groups receiving higher doses, with little 
difference between the group receiving a dose of 20 million PFU and the group receiving a 
dose of 100 million PFU. Although transient arthralgia was noted in a minority of 
volunteers, clinical arthritis, which was reported in another clinical trial of the vaccine 
candidate, was not observed at the WRAIR or NIH site. These data supported selection of 20 
million PFU as the dose for clinical end-point trials (PREVAIL trial, the Guinea study, and 
STRIVE) in West Africa. In the Guinea study, this dose recently showed high protective 
efficacy with the use of a ring vaccination strategy.12
Transient rVSV viremia was detected after immunization, recapitulating the experience 
described previously in nonhuman primates.19 The clinical symptoms associated with this 
viremia included fever and appeared to peak and then decrease in the 12 to 36 hours after 
vaccination. Overall, safety laboratory values were subclinical and unremarkable. Moderate 
asymptomatic declines in leukocyte subsets (e.g., lymphopenia and neutropenia) were noted 
during the first 3 days after vaccination and resolved rapidly. The data from the clinical trials 
presented herein are consistent with the preclinical experience and, combined with the 
established attenuation of the vaccine vector, provide further support for the safety of rVSV 
vectors.2,13,20
The immunoprotective profile that is required for the prevention of EVD remains largely 
unknown, and mechanistic correlates of protection remain undefined. Successful protection 
in the nonhuman primate model has been shown with various vaccine candidates, with

 imputation of both cellular and humoral immune responses as correlates of protection.21,22 
In the nonhuman primate challenge model, antibody response, principally IgG, has been the 
strongest immune correlate of protection associated with the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine 
candidate.10,23,24 Although the Kikwit strain ELISA has become the primary readout, 
examination of the Mayinga-strain glycoprotein titers (Table S9 in the Supplementary 
Appendix) suggests that the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine candidate produces cross-strain 
glycoprotein-specific antibodies similar to those described for the chimpanzee adenovirus 3 
vaccine candidate.3 Neutralizing antibody assays typically have been difficult to correlate 
with outcomes in studies in animals involving EVD, but the functional assay used for the 
reported trials showed a strong association with protection of nonhuman primates across 
multiple vaccine platforms and warrants further investigation as a correlate of 
protection.24-27
A second dose of vaccine was less reactogenic and induced less viremia than the primary 
dose. Although a two-dose regimen was associated with a short-term advantage with respect 
to the magnitude of the humoral response, we did not observe a significant difference in the 
day 180 titer between the one-dose and two-dose vaccine regimens. The vaccine candidate 
has already shown efficacy in populations living in regions in which EBV is endemic, but 
the immunologic profiles presented here suggest that two doses of vaccine administered 
within a short time frame may provide increased short-term benefit.5 In addition, however, 
strategies such as longer intervals between doses could be pursued to improve the longer-
term immunologic profile. Such work would need to go hand-in-hand with assessment of 
efficacy in the animal model and validation of the presented immune correlates.
The results reported here support the safety, acceptable side-effect profile, and 
immunogenicity of up to two doses of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine and encourage further 
investigation of this vaccine candidate. Most promising are the robust immune responses 
after a single dose of the vaccine and the rapid onset of immunity, which could be 
particularly useful in outbreak interventions. Although we found short-term increases in 
humoral immunity after a second dose at the 1-month interval, it remains unknown whether 
this regimen will translate to improved clinical efficacy. Strategies to better understand and 
improve immunogenicity, including assessment of dose and regimen alterations, a longer 
duration of follow-up, and cross-strain protection against other Ebola viruses, could be 
pursued.

 Figure 2. Antibody Responses to Ebola Glycoprotein
Individual antibody titers as assessed at 14 and 28 days after vaccination are shown 
according to vaccine dose group, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) against the Zaire–Kikwit strain glycoprotein (Panel A) and a pseudovirion 
neutralization assay (Panel B). Geometric mean titers (horizontal lines) are shown for each 
group and time point. Geometric mean titers from 28 days after initial vaccination through 
180 days after initial vaccination are shown for the glycoprotein ELISA (Panel C) and the 
pseudovirion neutralization assay (Panel D). Solid lines indicate groups that received a 
second dose at day 28, and dashed lines indicate groups that did not receive a second dose at 
day 28. In all panels, I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.
