Abstract
The onset of distant organ metastasis from primary breast
cancer marks the transition to a stage IV diagnosis. Standard
imaging modalities often detect distant metastasis when the
burden of disease is high, underscoring the need for improved
methods of detection to allow for interventions that would
impede disease progression. Here, microporous poly(e-capro-
lactone) scaffolds were developed that capture early metastatic
cells and thus serve as a sentinel for early detection. These
scaffolds were used to characterize the dynamic immune
response to the implant spanning the acute and chronic foreign
body response. The immune cell composition had stabilized at
the scaffold after approximately 1 month and changed dramat-
ically within days to weeks after tumor inoculation, with
CD11bþGr1hiLy6C� cells having the greatest increase in abun-
dance. Implanted scaffolds recruited metastatic cancer cells that
were inoculated into the mammary fat pad in vivo, which also
significantly reduced tumor burden in the liver and brain.
Additionally, cancer cells could be detected using a label-free
imaging modality termed inverse spectroscopic optical coher-
ence tomography, and we tested the hypothesis that subse-
quent removal of the primary tumor after early detection would
enhance survival. Surgical removal of the primary tumor fol-
lowing cancer cell detection in the scaffold significantly
improved disease-specific survival. The enhanced disease-spe-
cific survival was associated with a systemic reduction in the
CD11bþGr1hiLy6C� cells as a consequence of the implant,
which was further supported by Gr-1 depletion studies. Imple-
mentation of the scaffold may provide diagnostic and therapeutic
options for cancer patients in both the high-risk and adjuvant
treatment settings. Cancer Res; 76(18); 5209–18. �2016 AACR.
Introduction
The oncogenic progression of breast cancer from the primary
tumor to distant metastatic sites is the critical event that defines
stage IV disease (1–3). Currently, metastatic disease is detected
through radiologic imaging modalities after the burden of distant
disease has become destructive to the host organ (4–6). A lim-
itation to the development of life-preserving timely interventions
is the striking lack of robust technologies capable of early detec-
tion of metastatic events. Additionally, experimental model sys-
tems are needed that permit systematic screening and examina-
tion of factors contributing to breast cancer metastasis in a
controlled setting. Detection of circulating tumor cells (CTC) is
being pursued in both the experimental and clinical settings.
While promising (7, 8), the widespread use of CTC capture is
not without challenges, given the high biomarker sensitivity and
specificity required to capture a low number of circulating CTCs
(9, 10). Furthermore, CTCs may not represent the population of
cells capable of metastasis or these cells could circulate for long
periods before invading distant organs. The capacity to identify
metastatic cells or foci at the earliest possible time point may
permit the delivery of targeted treatment interventions prior to the
compromise of distant organs, potentially translating into pro-
longed distant metastasis-free outcomes. Thus, there is an urgent
need for development of novel technologies to aid in the detec-
tion of metastatic events in the nascent setting.
An emerging approach for early detection lies with the implan-
tation of a biomaterial scaffold that can capture metastatic cells
(11). These scaffolds were modeled after the concept of the pre-
metastatic niche (12, 13), echoing Paget's "seed and soil" hypoth-
esis proposed over a century ago (12, 14–17). This paradigm

 proposes that, prior to colonization by metastatic cells, supportive
cells (e.g., fibroblasts, immune cells, and endothelial cells), soluble
factors, and extracellular matrix (ECM) components establish a
microenvironment conducive to tumor cell homing and coloniza-
tion(12,14–17).Importantly,thesestudiesindicatethatmetastasis
to specific organs is not random, but is influenced by the properties
ofthelocalenvironment(12,13,18).Theinitialtranslationofthese
principles led to the development and implementation of micro-
porous poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) biomaterial scaffolds,
which recruited metastatic breast cancer cells through the local
immune response in vivo, resulting in decreased tumor burden at
metastatic sites (11). However, PLG scaffolds were degradable over
time scales considered too short for clinical translation.
In this report, we developed microporous poly(e-caprolactone)
(PCL) scaffolds with greater stability than the PLG scaffolds, to
investigate the dynamic immune response and cellular events
associated with PCL scaffold–mediated recruitment of metastatic
breast cancer cells. Specifically, utilizing PCL scaffolds in meta-
static breast cancer murine models we examined if (i) metastatic
cells could be recruited to the scaffold; (ii) metastatic cells could
be detected in the scaffold at a nascent stage, prior to cancer cell
colonization of other major organs, using label-free imaging
modalities; and (iii) scaffold implantation could influence sur-
vival following detection of cancer cells in the scaffold and then
subsequent surgical removal of the primary tumor. The favorable
translational endpoints from these studies could lead to the
integration of scaffold implants, fabricated using FDA-approved
materials, into breast cancer disease management plans. More-
over, scaffolds could be recovered to examine the biology of
metastatic tumor cells in conjunction with "niche" cells enabling
the development of patient-specific treatments.
Materials and Methods
Fabrication, characterization, and implantation of
microporous scaffolds
Scaffold fabrication and characterization. For the preparation of
microporous PCL scaffolds, PCL microspheres were first prepared
by emulsifying a 6% (w/w) solution of PCL (Lactel Absorbable
Polymers; Inherent viscosity ¼ 0.65–0.85 dL/g) in dichloro-
methane in a 10 % poly(vinyl alcohol) solution followed by
homogenization at 10,000 rpm for �1 minute. The solution was
then stirred for 3 hours. Microspheres were collected by centri-
fugation and washed at least 5 times in deionized water, followed
by lyophilization for 48 hours. To prepare microporous PCL
scaffolds, PCL microspheres and salt particles (size range, 250–
425 mm) were mixed in a 1:30 (w/w) ratio and pressed at 1,500 psi
in a steel die for �45 seconds. Polymer-salt discs were heated at
60�C for �5 minutes on each side, followed by foaming in high
pressure CO2 at 800 psi for �24 hours. Salt particles were removed
by immersing discs in water. For experimental studies, scaffolds
were sterilized using 70% ethanol, rinsed with sterile water, and
dried on a sterile gauze pad. Microporous PLG scaffolds were
prepared as described previously (19). Scaffolds were character-
ized using mechanical testing, scanning electron microscopy, and
calculation of porosity. Technical details are available in Supple-
mentary Materials and Methods.
Scaffold implantation. Microporous scaffolds were implanted in
the subcutaneous space of either female BALB/c or NOD/SCID-
IL2Rg�/� (NSG) mice (8–10-week-old). All animal studies were
performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and pro-
tocols approved by Northwestern University and the University of
Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. NSG
mice were bred in house or purchased from the Jackson labora-
tory. BALB/c mice were purchased from The Jackson laboratory.
For the implantation procedure, mice were anesthetized with an
intraperitoneal injection of Ketamine (100 mg/kg) and Xylazine
(5 mg/kg). The upper back was shaved and prepped using a
betadine swab followed by an ethanol swab (3X). An incision
was made in the upper back, and a subcutaneous pocket was
created on each side, into which the scaffolds were inserted (2
scaffolds per mouse). The skin was closed using wound clips
(Reflex 7 mm, Roboz Surgical Instrument Co.) and surgical glue
(3M Vetbond Tissue Adhesive).
Tumor inoculation
Orthotopic tumor inoculation was performed 1 month after
scaffold
implantation.
MDA-MB-231BR-tdTomato-luc2
cells
were obtained from the Northwestern University Developmental
Therapeutics Core and authenticated by short tandem repeat DNA
analysis and comparison to the ATCC STR profile database in
2013 (DDC Medical). 4T1-luc2-tdTomato cells were obtained
from Perkin Elmer in 2014 and were used directly without
additional authentication. A total of 2 � 106 4T1-luc2-tdTomato
(Perkin Elmer) or MDA-MB-231BR-tdTomato-luc2 cells in 50 mL
sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS; Life Technologies) were
injected into the fourth right mammary fat pad of 12- to 14-
week-old female BALB/c or NSG mice.
Flow cytometry
Mice were euthanized at indicated times, and retrieved scaffolds
and organs were processed according to previously established
procedures, which are described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods (11). Flow cytometry staining and analysis were per-
formed according to established procedures (please see Supple-
mentary Materials and Methods; ref. 11).
Scaffold sectioning and fluorescence imaging
Scaffolds retrieved from mice were rinsed in PBS and then
immediately flash frozen in pre-chilled isopentane. Frozen
scaffolds were then embedded in optimal cutting temperature
(Cardinal Health) compound with 30% sucrose and sectioned
using a cryostat (Microm HM 525; Microm International) at 14
mm. Scaffold sections were stored at �20�C until imaging.
Cryosections were air-dried at room temperature for 30 min-
utes, fixed with 10% neutral-buffered formalin, washed with
tap water for 5 minutes, DI water for 10 minutes (2X) and cover
slipped with ProLong Gold antifade aqueous mounting medi-
um containing DAPI (Molecular Probes). DAPI fluorescence
was visualized using an excitation wavelength of 358 nm, and
tdTomato fluorescence in cancer cells was visualized using an
excitation wavelength of 532 nm. Images were viewed using an
Olympus BX43 microscope, and an Olympus DP72 digital
camera with CellSens Entry software (Olympus) was used for
image capture and colocalization.
Inverse spectroscopic optical coherence tomography imaging
and analysis
Inverse spectroscopic optical coherence tomography (ISOCT)
imaging and analysis was performed as described elsewhere

Post-surgical model of breast cancer metastasis and Gr-1
depletion
The influence of scaffold implant on survival was investigated
using a post-surgical model of breast cancer metastasis (23, 24). In
this model, the 4T1 primary tumor was resected 6 or 10 days after
tumor inoculation. Briefly, the primary tumor area was prepped
using a betadine swab followed by an ethanol swab (3X). An
incision was made along the right side of the lower half of the
dorsal skin exposing the primary tumor. The tumor was picked up
using needle nose-forceps and cut around the base using curved
tip scissors. The skin was closed using MONOCRYL (poligleca-
prone 25) suture (Ethicon, Inc.) and surgical glue (3M Vetbond
Tissue Adhesive). Animal health was monitored daily after the
procedure for activity and responsiveness, including posture,
mobility, body weight, grooming behavior, and respiratory
conditions. Animals were euthanized if found in a moribund
condition as an experimental endpoint. Mice that evidenced
primary tumor re-growth were excluded from the analysis to
avoid confounding effects arising from the primary tumor. For
Gr-1 depletion studies, resection was performed at day 10 as
described above and mice received 300 mg anti-Gr-1 (clone
RB6-8C5, Bio X Cell) via intraperitoneal injection at days 13
and 17 after tumor inoculation.
Data analysis
Data are presented as mean � standard error (SEM). Animal
studies were performed with at least two independent replicates of
4 to 8 female 8–12-week-old mice per group with random
assignment. Multiple comparisons were performed using one-
way ANOVA. Comparisons post ANOVA was performed using the
Tukey HSD test. For data that did not follow a normal distribu-
tion, comparison was performed using the nonparametric Wil-
coxon rank-sum test. For comparing the relative number of mice
containing detectable tumor cells in organs with scaffolds, a Fisher
exacttest wasusedto determinetheP value.Statisticalanalysiswas
performed using JMP Software (JMP Pro 11). For survival analysis,
the Kaplan–Meier curve was generated, and statistical analysis was
performed using a Log-rank test using Sigma Plot (Version 13).
Results
Microporous PCL scaffolds for in vivo recruitment of
metastatic cells
We developed microporous PCL scaffolds (Fig. 1A, 5 mm
diameter and 2 mm height) to create microenvironments in vivo
and subsequently examine their ability to recruit metastatic tumor
cells. The porous interconnected architecture of the scaffold was
confirmed using SEM imaging (Fig. 1B). Microstructural features,
such as porosity, pore volume, and mechanical properties (i.e.,
elastic modulus), were similar for PCL and previously reported
PLG scaffolds (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 11). The ability of
PCL scaffolds to persist and create a defined space in vivo was
investigated by implantation into the subcutaneous dorsal space
of BALB/c and NSG mice. The subcutaneous site was selected for
its accessibility and amenability to noninvasive imaging. Further-
more, neither 4T1 nor MDA-MB-231BR breast cancer cells typi-
cally metastasize to the subcutaneous space, thus the presence of
cancer cells in the metastatic site would likely be associated with
the presence of the scaffold. PCL scaffolds retrieved after 3 months
experienced minimal degradation when compared with day 0 as
opposed to PLG scaffolds, which had previously been used for in
vivo recruitment of tumor cells (11). PLG scaffolds showed sig-
nificant degradation over this time period as quantified by scaf-
fold area (i.e., 66% in NSG and 77% in BALB/c mouse; Supple-
mentary Fig. S1).
The dynamic immune response to the biomaterial implant was
investigated throughout the acute and chronic phases. Implan-
tation of the PCL scaffold into healthy BALB/c mice resulted in
infiltration of CD45þ leukocytes by day 3. The number of CD45þ
leukocytes remained relatively unchanged after day 14 post scaf-
fold implantation (Fig. 1C). However, the relative distribution of
leukocyte populations examined, including innate and adaptive
immune cells, changed dynamically following scaffold implan-
tation. The percentage of inflammatory monocytes, identified as
Ly6CþF4/80� cells, decreased after day 3 and remained relatively
stable at later time points, whereas the percentage of dendritic
cells, identified as CD11cþF4/80�, increased after day 3 and
remained stable at later time points (Fig. 1D). These two cell
populations constituted the majority of cells (i.e., �65%)
observed at the PCL scaffold at later time points. The percentage
of macrophages, identified as CD11bþF4/80þ cells, significantly
increased through day 14 (e.g., 8.8% at day 14 vs. 1.7% at day
3, Fig. 1D, P < 0.05) and then returned to levels observed at day 3
(e.g., 1.4 % at day 60, Fig. 1D, P ¼ 0.99 compared with day 3). In
contrast, the levels of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells remained low at
all time points examined at 0.15 % (Fig. 1D). In the adaptive
immune cell population, the percentage of CD4þ helper T cells
and CD8þ cytotoxic T cells significantly increased over time (e.g.,
1% at day 3 to 9% at day 60 for CD4þ and 1.2% at day 3 to 3% at
day 60 for CD8þ, respectively, Fig. 1D, P < 0.05). The percentage of
B cells, identified as CD19þ, and natural killer (NK) cells, iden-
tified as CD49bþ, increased post day 3 and returned to day 3 levels
at later time points (i.e., days 30 and 60; Fig. 1D). Importantly, the
relative percentages of leukocyte subpopulations were similar
between day 30 and day 60 after scaffold implantation in
BALB/c mice (Fig. 1D). This trend was also observed in NSG mice
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Based on the stabilization of cell popu-
lations after day 30, we utilized day 30 as a time point representing
the chronic response to a scaffold implant in all following
experiments.
Wesubsequentlyexamined therecruitmentofmetastaticcellsto
a chronically implanted microporous scaffold (i.e., a scaffold that
had been implanted for 30 days prior to tumor inoculation, a time
corresponding to the chronic phase of the immune response).
Flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging (Fig. 2) performed for
scaffolds retrieved at day 15 after tumor inoculation demonstrated
the presence of mouse 4T1 tumor cells in the scaffold, indicating
that the local microenvironment enabled recruitment of tumor
cells. Total cell infiltration was significantly greater within PCL
scaffolds compared with PLG scaffolds (i.e., �6 � 105 cells in the
PCL scaffold vs. �1 � 105 cells in the PLG scaffold, P < 0.0001, Fig.
2A) and a similar trend was observed for tumor cell recruitment
(Fig. 2B, P < 0.01). Scaffolds were also able to recruit human MDA-
MB-231BR cells in NSG mice (Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating
that such a system enabled recruitment of mouse and human
breast cancer cells in the context of both immune competent and
immune compromised mouse models, respectively.

 characterized, as tumor cells are known to influence the recruit-
ment of immune cells from the bone marrow (25). Flow
cytometric analysis indicated an increase in Ly6CþF4/80� and
CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells at the PCL scaffold site (Fig. 3C
and D, P < 0.0005). For example, the numbers of CD11bþGr-
1hiLy6C� cells increasedfrom 0.1 % at day 0 to17 % at day 21 after
tumor inoculation (P < 0.05),an increase of 2 orders of magnitude
relative to their numbers at the PCL scaffold site in tumor-free
BALB/c mice (Figs. 1D and 3C). Both cell types have been
implicated in the pre-metastatic niche (15, 25–28). In contrast,
the percentages of CD11bþF4/80þ macrophages, CD11cþF4/
80� dendritic cells, and CD8þ cytotoxic T cells decreased at the
PCL scaffold site (Fig. 3A, C and F, e.g., 30% at day 0 vs. 14% at
day 21 for dendritic cells, P < 0.05). The percentage of CD19þ B
cells, CD49bþ NK cells, and CD4þ helper T cells increased at
day 3 and then decreased at later time points (Fig. 3G, H and E).
Specifically, NK cells increased from 4% at day 0 to 8% at day 3,
followed by a decrease to 2.5% at day 21 after tumor inocu-
lation (Fig. 3H, P < 0.05). Interestingly, the immune cell
dynamics at the PCL scaffold site reflected the dynamics
observed in the spleen after tumor inoculation (Fig. 3 vs.
Supplementary Fig. S3). In summary, the changing immune
microenvironment at the PCL scaffold site after tumor inocu-
lation correlated with recruitment of 4T1 tumor cells, and is
consistent with prior literature reports on the role of the
immune cells in the pre-metastatic niche (15, 25–30).
Early detection of metastatic cells at the PCL scaffold
The ability to detect the presence of metastatic disease at
an early stage was examined through evaluation of the percentage
of tumor cells in the PCL scaffold relative to the cancer cells
detected in typical metastatic sites such as the lung, liver, and
brain, at day 5 after tumor inoculation. Flow cytometry analysis
revealed that the PCL scaffolds had a detectable percentage of
tumor cells (i.e., 0.005% � 0.002%) compared with the lung,
liver, and the brain, none of which had detectable tumor cells (Fig.
4A and B; N ¼ 5 for lung, liver, and brain, N ¼ 10 for PCL scaffolds,
P < 0.05, Fisher exact test). The greater density of tumor cells
observed at the PCL scaffold site compared with other organ sites
supports the use of this tool for detecting metastatic disease at a
nascent stage.
We subsequently investigated the feasibility of using a label-
free imaging technique, ISOCT, for the early detection of meta-
static disease in a chronic model of scaffold implantation. The
tissue was modeled as a continuous random refractive index
distribution, which enabled the refractive index correlation func-
tion shape factor D to be computed from the shape of the
backscattering intensity spectrum obtained with ISOCT (20). If
D has a value between 0 and 3, it has a physical meaning of a mass
fractal dimension, reflecting a more clumped structure associated
with higher D. Prior studies of early carcinogenesis with ISOCT
and a similar spectroscopic technique, low-coherence enhanced
backscattering spectroscopy, have revealed that D measured from
tissue increases with cancer progression (22, 31, 32). Thus, similar
ultra-structural tissue modifications occurring in the pre-meta-
static niche are likely to have an analogous effect on D.
D has previously been reported to reflect mass–density distribu-
tion features at length scales of 35 to 350 nm (21). In addition,
D values from tissue have been demonstrated as a robust bio-
marker of early-stage carcinogenesis (22). Consistent with these

of tumor cells. The color map overlay of D values (Fig. 4D and E)

 PCL scaffold implantation reduces tumor burden and improves
disease-specific survival
We subsequently investigated the hypothesis that the recruit-
ment of metastatic cells to the chronically implanted PCL scaf-
folds may reduce the tumor burden at typical metastatic sites, such
as the liver, brain, and the lung at day 15 after tumor inoculation.
Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the percentage of tumor
cells in the liver and the brain was reduced in mice receiving a PCL
scaffold versus mice undergoing a mock surgery. As stated, the
tumor burden was reduced by 64% for the liver (Fig. 5A, N ¼ 15,
P < 0.05) and 75% for the brain (Fig. 5B, N ¼ 8 for mock surgery,
N ¼ 6 for scaffold implant, P < 0.05 as determined using the
Wilcoxon rank-sum test in both cases). However, in this immu-
nocompetent mouse model, a reduction in the tumor burden in
the lung was not observed (Fig. 5C, N ¼ 11, P ¼ 0.7) distinct from
our previous observations in an immune compromised NSG
mouse inoculated with human MDA-MB-231BR cells (11).
A post-surgical model of breast cancer metastasis was then
applied to investigate the potential for PCL scaffold implants to
influence survival. In this model, the primary tumor was resected
at day 6 (Supplementary Fig. S5) or 10 (Fig. 6A) after tumor
inoculation, which corresponded to a time after which cancer cells

 were detectable in the scaffold by label-free imaging (i.e.,
day 5, Fig. 4). The resected tumor weights were comparable for
both groups, with tumors from the mock surgery group weighing
0.423 � 0.035 g versus tumors from scaffold implanted mice
weighing 0.419 � 0.029 g at day 10 after inoculation (P ¼ 0.93, t-
test, Fig. 6B). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis demonstrated a
significant improvement in survival in mice receiving a PCL
scaffold implant compared to mice receiving a mock surgery with
resection at day 10 (Fig. 6C, N ¼ 7 per group, P < 0.05, log-rank
test). The sacrifice endpoints utilized for mice in both groups for
data corresponding to Fig. 6 are described in Supplementary Table
S2. With resection at day 6 after tumor inoculation, �40% of both
mock and scaffold groups survived indefinitely (Supplementary
Fig. S5), mirroring the 40% survival in the scaffold group with day
10 resection (Fig. 6C), indicating that the scaffold increased the
time over which a therapeutic intervention such as surgery can be
performed and provide a survival benefit.
Given the greatest increase in the abundance of CD11bþGr-
1hiLy6C� cells (2 orders of magnitude change) at the PCL scaffold
site after tumor inoculation, we hypothesized that the increased
survival with scaffold implantation may reflect a differential
distribution of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells at the primary tumor
(local) and the spleen (systemic). Flow cytometric analysis indi-
cated that the abundance of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells was
reduced in mice receiving a scaffold implant versus mice receiving
a mock surgery examined at day 10 after tumor inoculation. The
burden of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells was reduced by 39% in the
primary tumor (Fig. 7A) and 30% in the spleen (Fig. 7B, N � 7, P <
0.05 as determined by t-test in both cases). This result suggests
that, in part, the presence of the scaffold contributes to a reduction
in the abundance of key niche cells locally (i.e., primary tumor
site) and systemically (i.e., spleen) that support metastasis. This
observation was further investigated via Gr-1 antibody depletion
of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells in vivo, which was performed in the
context of surgical resection (Supplementary Fig. S6). Mice receiv-
ing a mock surgery with Gr-1 depletion demonstrated survival
greater than 20% by day 40 (Fig. 7C), with no survival observed at
this time without Gr-1 depletion (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, with Gr-
1 depletion, the observed difference in survival between mock and
scaffold groups was not statistically significant (Fig. 7C), further
supporting the involvement of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells in
improving disease-specific survival in our model. Taken together,
these results highlight the potential for PCL scaffold in improving
disease-specific survival outcomes.
Discussion
In this study, microporous PCL scaffolds, implanted prior to
tumor initiation, recruited metastatic cells at an early time point in
disease progression. The novel approach to this work was based
on recapitulating some of the immunological aspects of the pre-
metastatic niche, while prior reports have focused on materials to
mimic properties of target organs (e.g., bone, refs. 33, 34; bone
marrow, ref. 35). Previous elegant studies of the pre-metastatic
niche have identified some of the biological cues involved in
cancer cell recruitment, such as the cellular components (e.g.,
hematopoietic and endothelial progenitor cells, immune cells),
soluble factors (e.g., cytokines, chemokines), and ECM proteins
(12, 14–17). Importantly, as indicated by Lyden (12, 18), the
existence of the pre-metastatic niche implies that metastasis to a
particular site is not random, but is predetermined, which sup-
ports the idea that a site could be engineered to attract metastatic
cells. A synthetic scaffold provides an opportunity to create a
defined environment to investigate the role of specific compo-
nents involved in the colonization of metastatic cells. Scaffolds
can be modified with specific niche components, such as stromal
cells, ECM molecules, and cytokines to identify the key signals in
the metastatic environment (36, 37), thereby providing a tool

 with which to advance fundamental studies of the pre-metastatic
niche and tumor metastasis. Herein, the scaffold defines a site for
immune cell infiltration, and we characterize the dynamic
immune response associated with cancer cell recruitment.
The immune cell populations at the PCL scaffold, which had
stabilized prior to tumor inoculation, were substantially altered
after tumor inoculation, suggesting that the changing foreign
body response to the implant may contribute to metastatic cell
recruitment. Immune cells are recognized as significant to the pre-
metastatic niche (15, 25–30). As such, chemokine CCL-2 recruits
inflammatory monocytes (Ly6CþF4/80� cells) to the pre-meta-
static niche enabling metastasis of breast cancer cells (28). Sim-
ilarly, CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells are recruited via inflammatory
chemoattractants (e.g., S100A8 and S100A9) to pre-metastatic
niches (38). In addition, CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells are known to
downregulate infiltration and suppress the function of T cells
(CD4þ and CD8þ T cells) and NK cells (38–41). Consistent with
these observations, we found an increase in the levels of mono-
cytes and CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells atthe scaffold site after tumor
inoculation and an associated decrease in the abundance of CD4þ
T cells, CD8þ T cells, and CD49bþ NK cells, with the greatest
change observed for CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells (i.e., more than 2
orders of magnitude). Importantly, the changing immune com-
position as a consequence of disease progression observed in the
spleen largely reflected the dynamics at the scaffold site. Taken
together, these results suggest that engineering a local microen-
vironment may be used to identify and modulate key components
of cancer-associated immunogenicity in the pre-metastatic niche.
The implantation of PCL scaffolds enhanced disease-specific
survival, which we hypothesized to be related to the decreased
tumor burden in major organ sites and a reduction in systemic
availability of key immune cells that support metastasis. The
implantation of PCL scaffolds in the subcutaneous space
reduced tumor burden in major organ sites (i.e., liver and
brain) in an immunocompetent mouse model. We previously
reported a reduction in burden in the lung in an immunocom-
promised mouse model using PLG scaffolds implanted in the
intraperitoneal fat pad after tumor inoculation (11). The results
of the current study extend our previous observation and
importantly suggest that a scaffold-based approach can con-
tribute to the reduction in disease burden in solid organs in
both immunocompetent and compromised mouse models and
when implanted at different sites. Metastatic cells could be
detected within chronically implanted PCL scaffolds by day 5
following tumor inoculation using ISOCT imaging, which
allowed for label-free detection of metastasis through changes
in the tissue ultrastructure (e.g., matrix organization) and the
presence of cancer cells that have a distinct nanoscale signature
relative to normal cells (22). In order to use ISOCT analysis for
diagnostic screening of early metastasis, ultrastructural para-
meters measured with ISOCT (D, correlation length Ln, and
refractive index fluctuation Bn), which independently change in
the presence of carcinogenic tissue modification, would need to
be investigated to establish a multivariate diagnostic for
patients with metastatic disease.
The resection of the primary tumor at day 10 after tumor
inoculation resulted in increased survival in mice that received
a scaffold. The increased survival may result from a decreased
burden of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells observed locally at the
primary tumor and systemically in the spleen of a scaffold-bearing
mouse when compared with a mouse that received a mock
surgery. Gr-1 depletion studies further supported this observa-
tion, as mice receiving a mock surgery survive longer in the context
of Gr-1 depletion, and the difference between mock and scaffold
groups was abrogated with Gr-1 depletion. As stated, CD11bþGr-
1hiLy6C� cells or myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) have
been implicated in the pre-metastatic niche and the reduced
abundance of these cells systemically may contribute to the
reduced burden in solid organs and, ultimately, to enhanced
survival (42–44). Finally, MDSCs have been identified in high
numbers in patients with metastatic disease, correlating with
clinical stage and metastatic disease burden, and their levels are
predictive of overall survival (45–47). Thus, a scaffold-based
approach that reduces the abundance of MDSCs could, in part,
explain the survival benefit observed in our studies. Taken togeth-
er, the ability to detect metastatic disease at an early stage, in
Figure 7.
Microporous PCL scaffolds reduce burden of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells in the primary tumor (A) and the spleen (B) in BALB/c mice. The percentage of CD11bþ Gr-1hi
Ly6C� cells in the CD45þ leukocyte population was examined at day 10 after tumor inoculation via flow cytometry and is reported as normalized burden
(N ¼ 7 for mock surgery; N ¼ 8 for scaffold implant; �, P < 0.05 as determined using t test). C, anti-Gr-1 depletion of CD11bþGr-1hiLy6C� cells enhances survival
in both mock and scaffold groups and diminishes the survival advantage observed for PCL implanted mice (N ¼ 4 per group). Error bars, SEM.

 combination with the survival benefit provided by the scaffold,
highlights the potential for this technology in transforming the
current detection and management of metastatic disease.
The recruitment of metastatic cells to the scaffold, combined
with label-free imaging for detection of nascent stage metastatic
cells, and reduced burden of disease in solid organs (i.e., liver and
brain), may ultimately allow for interventions when the disease
burden is low that could translate to improved disease-specific
outcomes. In the clinical setting, the scaffold may be integrated
into disease management plans by potentially serving as a sentinel
site for detection of disease metastasis or recurrence. For example,
the scaffold could be implanted in patients with a diagnosis of
invasive cancer at the completion of adjuvant therapy, and mon-
itored during scheduled follow-up visits using the optical imaging
technique. If metastatic or recurrent disease was then detected, the
scaffold could be explanted for cell retrieval and analysis to help
guide targeted treatment decisions. Furthermore, in the setting of
metastatic disease, given the potential survival benefit of the
presence of the scaffold, patients may have extended disease-
specific survival with excision of the primary tumor and scaffold
implantation long term. Finally, the scaffold may be implanted
prophylactically to help detect early onset metastatic disease in
high-risk patients.
Our results provide the first evidence that a scaffold for
capture and detection of early metastatic cells, combined with
an intervention shortly after detection of early metastasis (i.e.,
primary tumor excision), can enhance survival. This biomate-
rial approach is based on the host response to an implanted
scaffold, thereby avoiding the presence of potentially deleteri-
ous cellular or biological components. PCL material is currently
FDA approved for applications such as drug delivery, suture
material, and wound dressings, which may facilitate translation
to the clinic for the capture of metastatic cells (48). Also, this
material is biodegradable and would not need to be retrieved
unless cancer cells are detected; and the degradation rate is
relatively slow allowing the implant to be monitored for up to 2
years within a patient (49, 50). Clinical studies would be
necessary to appropriately integrate metastatic cell-capturing
scaffolds into existing breast cancer management plans. Taken
together, the results of this work showing prolonged survival
with scaffold implantation hold promise for reducing breast
cancer morbidity and mortality.
