Background: Previous studies have reported anomalous resting brain activity in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) of alcoholics, often reflected as increased power in the beta
and theta frequency bands. The effects of binge drinking, the most common pattern of
excessive alcohol consumption during adolescence and youth, on brain activity at rest
is still poorly known. In this study, we sought to assess the pattern of resting-state EEG
oscillations in college-aged binge drinkers (BDs).
Methods:
Resting-state brain activity during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions
was recorded from 60 channels in 80 first-year undergraduate students (40 controls
and 40 BDs). Cortical sources activity of EEG rhythms was estimated using exact
Low-Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (eLORETA) analysis.
Results: EEG-source localization analysis revealed that BDs showed, in comparison
with controls, significantly higher intracranial current density in the beta frequency band
over the right temporal lobe (parahippocampal and fusiform gyri) during eyes-open
resting state as well as higher intracranial current density in the theta band over the
bilateral occipital cortex (cuneus and lingual gyrus) during eyes-closed resting condition.
Conclusions: These findings are in line with previous results observing increased beta
and/or theta power following chronic or heavy alcohol drinking in alcohol-dependent
subjects and BDs. Increased tonic beta and theta oscillations are suggestive of an
augmented cortical excitability and of potential difficulties in the information processing
capacity in young BDs. Furthermore, enhanced EEG power in these frequency bands
may respond to a neuromaturational delay as a result of excessive alcohol consumption
during this critical brain developmental period.

The Brain of Binge Drinkers at Rest
INTRODUCTION
According to the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism, a binge is a pattern of drinking alcohol that brings
blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 g percent or higher,
which corresponds to consuming five or more drinks for men
and four or more for women within a 2-h interval (National
Institute of Alcohol, Abuse and Alcoholism, 2004). This type of
excessive alcohol use is a highly prevalent pattern, mostly among
high school and college students (Courtney and Polich, 2009).
Recent reports show that around one third of young Europeans
and North Americans are binge drinkers (BDs; Kraus et al., 2016;
SAMHSA, 2016).
This prevalent pattern has been related to an array
of negative consequences, including traffic collisions, poor
academic performance, risky sexual behavior and neurocognitive
deficits (White and Hingson, 2013; Carbia and López-Caneda,
2016). Concerning the latter, studies using neuropsychological
batteries have demonstrated that BDs exhibit poor performance
on tasks involving a number of cognitive processes such as, verbal
and prospective memory (Heffernan et al., 2010; Carbia et al.,
2017), inhibitory control (Czapla et al., 2015) or decision making
(Moreno et al., 2012).
Electrophysiological measures of brain activity have also
proved to be efficient methods for the comprehension of
neurocognitive function as well as for the understanding of
dysfunctional processes linked to various psychiatric disorders,
including alcoholism (Parvaz et al., 2011; Kamarajan and Porjesz,
2015). Impairments in a variety of neurophysiological parameters
have been consistently observed in alcoholic patients both during
task execution and during resting state conditions (Campanella
et al., 2009). In the resting electroencephalogram (EEG)—i.e.,
the electrophysiological recording of oscillatory brain activity
while the person is relaxed- increased power in the beta and
theta frequency bands has been reported extensively. In this
sense, findings from several laboratories have repeatedly showed
that alcoholics manifest higher resting beta power than non-
dependent subjects (Costa and Bauer, 1997; Rangaswamy et al.,
2002, 2003; Coutin-Churchman and Moreno, 2008; Ehlers et al.,
2010; Mumtaz et al., 2016; Meyers et al., 2017). Furthermore,
increases in the beta band in relapsers in comparison with
alcoholics who remained abstinent (Bauer, 2001; Saletu-Zyhlarz
et al., 2004) and in non-alcoholic individuals compared to
alcoholic relatives (Pollock et al., 1995; Rangaswamy et al.,
2004), appears to strength the relationship between the alcoholic
spectrum and the beta power.
As with beta rhythms (although perhaps less consistently),
elevated theta activity at rest has been reported from resting-
state EEG studies in alcohol abusers (Pollock et al., 1992;
Rangaswamy et al., 2003; Mumtaz et al., 2016; but see Saletu-
Zyhlarz et al., 2004; Coutin-Churchman et al., 2006 for different
findings).
Despite the functional meaning of these higher beta and theta
rhythms in alcoholics is still under discussion, the increased
power in this frequency bands has often been interpreted
as reflecting cortical hyperexcitability—for beta rhythms- and
reduced-cognitive processing capacity—for theta frequencies
(Rangaswamy et al., 2002, 2003; Porjesz and Begleiter, 2003;
Campanella et al., 2009).
Although
comparatively
much
less
studied,
electrophysiological measures of brain activity also appear
to be sensitive to the BD pattern (López-Caneda et al., 2014a;
Petit et al., 2014b). As such, anomalous brain responses have been
documented in BD youths during cognitive tasks using event-
related potentials (ERPs) and event-related oscillations (EROs;
Crego et al., 2009; Maurage et al., 2012; Smith and Mattick,
2013; Petit et al., 2014a; Watson et al., 2014; López-Caneda
et al., 2017). Despite its well documented potential for detecting
neurofunctional anomalies in chronic alcoholics, brain activity
during task-free resting states has been virtually unaddressed
in the BD population. As such, to the best of our knowledge
only two studies have directly assessed the effects of BD on the
frequency spectrum of the whole brain at rest (Courtney and
Polich, 2010; Correas et al., 2015). Specifically, the EEG study
conducted by Courtney and Polich (2009) showed increased
delta and beta power in high-BDs during passive viewing, which
was considered a potential biomarker for future alcoholism.
Correas et al. (2015), using magnetoencephalography (MEG),
reported increased theta and decreased alpha power in the
occipital region of young BDs during eyes-closed resting state,
which was considered an initial sign of anomalous neural activity
caused by BD in youth. Although both studies point to anomalies
in neural activity at rest in young BDs, the neurofunctional
effects of this pattern of binge alcohol intake on the resting brain
are far from well-studied.
The current study is the first to use source localization
analysis to examine multichannel EEG data to detect the
active brain regions during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting
state in young BDs. To this end, we used the exact Low
Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography Analysis (eLORETA),
a well-validated source reconstruction model for mapping
source activations of scalp-recorded EEG (Pascual-Marqui, 2007;
Pascual-Marqui et al., 2011). We aimed to identify potentially
abnormal intracortical EEG patterns in young BDs as compared
to age-matched controls in specific brain regions to provide new
neurophysiological evidence that might prove useful for early
detection of brain damage associated with the BD pattern. We
hypothesized that young BDs will display anomalous patterns of
brain activity compared to control subjects, specifically in those
frequency spectra typically impaired in alcohol abusers, namely,
theta, and beta frequencies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
Eighty students from the Complutense University of Madrid
(Spain) participated in the study. This study is framed within a
research project aimed to assess brain damage associated with
BD. In this project, neuropsychological, neurostructural and
MEG measurements were also taken. Thus, the present study
shares part of the sample with the recent MEG study from
Correas et al. (2015). Participants were selected on the basis
of their responses to a questionnaire that included the Spanish
validated version of the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test

(AUDIT; Guillamón et al., 1999), the question 10 of the Alcohol
Use Questionnaire (“When you drink, how fast do you drink?
1 drink in 3 or more h; 1 drink in 2 h; Drinks per hour: 1, 2,
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or more”; Townshend and Duka, 2002), and other
information about alcohol and drugs consumption gathered
through a semi-structured interview. According to NIAAA’s BD
definition, participants reaching BAC ≥ 0.08 g/dL at least once
during the last month were classified as BDs. On the other hand,
the control group consisted of students who have never reached
an alcohol concentration of 0.08 g/dL. BAC was calculated based
on the information of the drinking episodes of the last 6 months
according to the following formula:
BAC =
�
G
W × bw
�
− mr × DP
where G corresponds to grams of alcohol consumed on one
occasion (the occasion of greatest consumption in the last
month); W is body weight (kilograms); bw is a constant related to
the water content of the human body, with value 0.68 for males
and 0.55 for females; mr is the metabolization rate with a value of
0.15 for males and 0.18 for females; and DP is the drinking period
(hours). Consequently, 40 participants were classified as BDs (20
females) and 40 as controls (19 females).
Impulsivity was assessed by the Barratt Impulsiveness
Scale (BIS-11; Patton et al., 1995) and psychopathological
symptoms were measured by the Symptom Checklist-90
revised questionnaire (SCL-90-R; Derogatis, 1983). Exclusion
criteria were: non-corrected sensory deficits, any episode of
loss of consciousness for more than 20 min, history of
traumatic brain injury or neurological disorder, personal history
of psychopathological disorders (according to DSM-IV-TR
criteria), family history of alcoholism or substance abuse in first
degree relatives, consumption of medical drugs with psychoactive
effects (e.g., sedatives or anxiolytics) during the week previous
to the assessment, AUDIT scores ≥ 20, and use of illegal drugs
except cannabis.
Participants were asked to refrain from consuming alcohol
at least 24 h before the EEG session. They were submitted to a
Breathalyzer test, and the assessment was only performed after
verifying 0% breath alcohol level. Additionally, subjects were
instructed not to smoke, or drink tea or coffee for at least
3 h before the assessment. All participants provided written
informed consent prior to assessment. The study was approved
by the Ethics Committee of the Complutense University of
Madrid and the procedure was undertaken in accordance
with the Code of Ethical Principles for Medical Research
Involving Humans Subjects outlined in the Declaration of
Helsinki.
EEG Acquisition
As part of a more extensive EEG study, 3 and 4 min of
electroencephalographic signal were acquired during eyes-open
and eyes-closed resting state, respectively. Each subject was
seated in a comfortable armchair located in a light- and sound-
attenuated electrically shielded room. The electroencephalogram
(EEG) was recorded using a 64-channel ActiCap system (Brain
Products, Munich, Germany). Electrodes were located on the
scalp according to the 10/10 system. All active electrodes were
referred to the nose tip and grounded with an electrode placed
at Fpz. Vertical and horizontal electrooculogram activity was
recorded to control for potentials evoked by eye movements and
blinks. Electrode impedances were kept below 20 k�. EEG signals
were continuously amplified and digitized at a rate of 500 Hz, and
filtered on-line with a 0.01–100 Hz band pass filter.
Data Analysis
Demographic data
Demographic variables were analyzed by a Student’s t-test or
chi-square test for independent samples.
EEG Processing
EEG data were processed with BrainVision Analyser software
(Version 2.1). The signal was digitally filtered off-line with a 0.1–
70 Hz band-pass filter and then corrected for ocular artifacts by
the procedure developed by Gratton et al. (1983). It was then
segmented into epochs of 4,000 ms for both eyes-open and eyes-
closed resting state. Epochs exceeding ± 100 µV at any scalp
electrode were rejected. The number of surviving epochs did not
differ significantly between groups in the eyes-open condition
(Control group: 42.2 ± 4.7; BD group: 42.2 ± 4.9) nor in the
eyes-closed condition (Control group: 54.5 ± 6.6; BD group:
56.1 ± 5.4).
EEG-Source Localization Analysis
For the estimation of cortical sources activity, EEG data from 60
channels were analyzed using eLORETA; free academic software
available
at
http://www.uzh.ch/keyinst/loreta.htm
(Pascual-
Marqui et al., 2011). The eLORETA is a three-dimensional,
discrete and linear weighted minimal norm inverse solution
method. The weights endow the tomography with the property
of exact localization to test point sources, yielding images of
current density with exact localization (spatial resolution 5 mm;
Pascual-Marqui, 2007, 2009). eLORETA images represent the
electrical activity at each of the 6,239 voxels (spatial resolution
5 mm) in the neuroanatomic Montreal Neurological Institute
(MNI) space (Mazziotta et al., 2001).
EEG data were re-referenced to the common average before
fast Fourier transformation. Mean power for each of the four
classical frequency bands was computed and averaged across
epochs for each subject in eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions
separately: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–12 Hz), and
beta (12–30 Hz).
Voxel-by-voxel between-group comparisons of the spectral
amplitude in source space were conducted using nonparametric
statistical mapping method (SnPM; Nichols and Holmes,
2002) implemented in the eLORETA software package. For
each single voxel, a t-test comparing amplitude estimates for
groups at defined frequency bands was performed. Then,
5,000 randomizations with the SnPM procedure were applied
to determine a statistical threshold (p < 0.05) corrected for
multiple comparisons. Significant voxels were attributed to the
corresponding Brodmann areas using the MNI space.

RESULTS
Demographic Results
Demographic and alcohol consumption data are summarized in
Table 1. There were no significant differences between groups
regarding age, handedness, regular use of cannabis (one or more
times a week), general severity index (GSI) of the SCL-R, or
BIS-11 scores. Groups differed significantly in age of onset of
regular drinking, number of drinks in a standard day, number
of drinks in a drinking episode, total AUDIT score, regular use of
tobacco (one or more times a week) and BAC (p < 0.001 for all
comparisons).
eLORETA Results
eLORETA analysis revealed significant differences between
controls and BDs at p < 0.05 after correction for multiple
testing during eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. Specifically,
the current density in the beta frequency band during eyes-
open resting state was significantly greater in the BD group in
comparison with the Control group (t threshold required for
significance: t = 3.115) in a large cluster involving the right
parahippocampal and the fusiform gyri, as specified in Table 2
and illustrated in Figure 1.
On the other hand, during the eyes-closed condition, the
current density in the theta frequency band was significantly
greater in the BD group in comparison with the Control group (t
threshold required for significance: t = 3.194) in a large bilateral
cluster involving the occipital cortex, specifically the cuneus and
the lingual gyrus (see Table 3 and Figure 2).
DISCUSSION
The major finding of the present study is that young university
students reporting a BD pattern displayed, in comparison with
age-matched control subjects, a significantly higher intracranial
current density in the beta frequency band in the right temporal

resting state as well as higher intracranial current density in the
theta band in the bilateral occipital cortex (cuneus and lingual
gyrus) during eyes-closed resting condition (see Figure 3).
As noted in the introduction, increased beta frequency
rhythms in the EEG of alcoholics, mostly during rest, has
been widely documented (Rangaswamy and Porjesz, 2014).
Although it is difficult to associate oscillatory activity of a
single frequency rhythm with a unique brain function, it
has been proposed that tonic beta rhythms indicate states
of enhanced arousal (Steriade et al., 1993; Engel and Fries,
2010). Thus, an imbalance in these oscillations may affect
the overall level of neural excitation, so that an increment in
the beta band may reflect a state of cortical hyperexcitability
(Edenberg et al., 2004). In this sense, the increased beta power
commonly observed in chronic alcoholics has been associated
with a neural disinhibition resulting from an imbalance
between excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Begleiter and Porjesz,

1999; Porjesz and Begleiter, 2003; Coutin-Churchman et al.,
2006).
Our data extend the notion of abnormally increased cortical
excitability seen in alcoholics to youths with a BD pattern,
who also show higher beta power at rest than age-matched
controls. In the same vein, the only previous study that, to our
knowledge, has assessed the resting EEG of young BDs also
observed increased beta- and delta-power in high-BDs during
passive viewing (Courtney and Polich, 2010). According to these
authors and to our results, this increment in beta power would be
suggestive of brain overactivity in young BDs.
The results of the present study also revealed that the BD
group exhibited higher theta power compared to the control
group during eyes-closed resting state. As stated early, increased
resting theta activity has been reported from several studies in
alcohol abusers (Pollock et al., 1992; Rasgaswamy et al., 2003;
Mumtaz et al., 2016).
In addition to alcoholics, enhanced tonic theta power has
been observed in a variety of neurological disorders including
Alzheimer’s disease (Dauwels et al., 2010), vascular dementia
(Babiloni et al., 2004), or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(Burke and Edge, 2013). Likewise, increases in the tonic theta
band have been remarked in altered neurophysiological states of
the brain such as, drowsy and sleep states (Makeig et al., 2000;
Tanaka et al., 2000) and after consumption of anesthetic drugs
(Voss and Sleigh, 2007) or depressant substances such as, alcohol
(Stenberg et al., 1994; Ehlers et al., 1998; Ilan and Gevins, 2001),
which appears to suggest that when the ability to respond to
external stimuli decreases, spontaneous theta activity increases
(Klimesch, 1999).
It is important to note here that tonic activity differs from
phasic or event-related changes in their origin and in their
functional implications. While phasic changes are more or less
under volitional control and take place at a rapid rate, tonic
changes are (usually) not deliberate and occur over the lifetime
in response to circadian rhythms, fatigue, distress, etc. (Klimesch,
1999). Regarding theta frequency band, tonic and phasic theta
oscillations seem to be dissociated with respect to cognitive
performance. In this sense, it has been reported that phasic
theta power is enhanced as a function of task difficulty, memory
load or attentional and cognitive control demands, and that
increments in this phasic oscillation are positively associated
with increasing cognitive performance (Klimesch et al., 2008;
Nigbur et al., 2011; Cavanagh and Shackman, 2015; Clayton
et al., 2015). Meanwhile, the opposite holds true for tonic theta
activity, i.e., a pronounced suppression of tonic theta power is
observed with increasing cognitive activity, whereas increments
are associated with impaired global cognitive function (Jeong,
2004; Niedermeyer, 2005; Dubbelink et al., 2014). Consequently,
large power in the range of tonic theta frequency has been
considered an index of reduced cognitive processing capacity
(Klimesch, 1999), and this is the reason why the higher
resting theta activity present in the EEG of alcoholics has been
suggested to reflect a deficit in information processing capacity
(Rangaswamy et al., 2003; Campanella et al., 2009). Accordingly,
the increased tonic theta power observed in the BD group of
the present study might indicate a poorer information processing
capacity compared to the control group.
Supporting the notion that BD may lead to similar
spontaneous oscillatory activity as that identified in alcoholics,
the only study examining whole brain activity measured by
MEG in young BDs and conducted from our research group
also reported higher theta power in the occipital region in BDs
in comparison with controls during eyes-closed resting state
(Correas et al., 2015). According to other BD studies assessing
potential neural anomalies at the functional and structural
level (Squeglia et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2013; Doallo et al.,
2014; López-Caneda et al., 2014b; Correas et al., 2016), studies
suggest that abnormal increases in the theta frequency band
might correspond with a neuromaturational delay induced by

a binge pattern of alcohol consumption during the adolescent
period.
Adolescence is a key developmental stage with profound
changes in brain morphology, generally reflected in an increase
in global white matter volumes and a decrease in global
gray matter structures (Lenroot and Giedd, 2006; Fuhrmann
et al., 2015). Mirroring these neuromaturational changes, the
oscillatory activity in the brain at rest is reduced in a broad
frequency range from low-delta to high-beta between late
childhood and early adulthood (Dustman et al., 1999; Boord
et al., 2007; Lüchinger et al., 2012; Rodríguez-Martínez et al.,
2017). Specifically, Whitford et al. (2007) and Buchmann et al.
(2011) reported a reduction in gray matter volumes with age
(ranging from 10 to 30 years and from 8 to 19 years, respectively)
that was accompanied by a significant decrease in spectral
power—most prominent in low frequencies—during awake and
sleep EEG recordings. This juxtaposed decline in EEG power
and gray matter has led to the suggestion that the synaptic
pruning that typically takes place during the transition from
childhood to adulthood is responsible for the observed reduction
in EEG frequencies (Boord et al., 2007; Whitford et al., 2007;
Feinberg and Campbell, 2010; Buchmann et al., 2011; Gómez
et al., 2017).
Within the heterogeneous pattern of neurodevelopmental
trajectories, the temporal cortex is the region where gray matter
matures last, peaking generally around 17 years of age (Giedd,
2004; Gogtay et al., 2004), although some studies have extended
this peak to around 30 years of age (Sowell et al., 2003). Taking
into account the relationship between EEG power and gray
matter changes, the increased beta power recorded over the
right temporal cortex (parahippocampal and fusiform gyri) in
the young BDs—aged 18 years—of our study might be related
to neuroanatomical immaturity in these subjects compared to
controls. As mentioned above, this would be in accordance with
several neurostructural studies indicating enlarged gray matter
(in some cases gender- and region-specific) in the BD population
(Squeglia et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2013; Doallo et al., 2014;
Kvamme et al., 2016; Morris et al., 2017). In particular, Kvamme
et al. (2016) found greater gray matter volumes in female BDs
in the bilateral fusiform gyrus and the right parahippocampal
gyrus, showing that these regions may be affected—i.e., may
undergo delayed synaptic pruning—due to BD. However, the lack
of studies directly comparing electrophysiological and structural
data in young BDs coupled with the fact that other studies
have reported reduced instead increased cortical volumes in this
population (Mashhoon et al., 2014; Squeglia et al., 2015) exhort
us to be cautious in this interpretation.
Besides that, a key feature of EEG maturation is the
progressive replacement of tonic theta power in the occipital
region in favor of faster rhythms from childhood to adolescence
and early adulthood, continuing until the third decade of life
(Niedermeyer, 2005; Segalowitz et al., 2010). Indeed, despite
resting theta activity having its maximum in occipital regions,
this is not prevalent in normal adult waking EEG (Puligheddu
et al., 2005; Kamarajan and Porjesz, 2015; Gómez et al., 2017).
Thus, the higher occipital theta power observed in young BDs
relative to age-matched controls may be linked to a slowing
down in the reduction of theta rhythms that naturally occurs
during development. However, further studies examining the
development of theta activity in young BDs are warranted to
confirm this hypothesis.
In summary, the present study used EEG-source localization
analysis in order to identify potentially anomalous resting EEG
frequency patterns in young BDs. Results showed a significantly
higher intracranial current density in the beta frequency
band over the right medial temporal cortex (parahippocampal
and fusiform gyri) during eyes-open rest, and in the theta
band over the bilateral occipital cortex (cuneus and lingual

gyrus) during eyes-closed, in 18 year-old BDs compared to
age-matched controls. These findings seem to be in line
with previous results in alcohol-dependent subjects and BDs
which observed increased beta and/or theta power following
chronic or heavy alcohol drinking. As in these studies, the
augmented tonic beta and theta oscillations obtained in our
study suggest cortical hyperexcitability and potential difficulties
in the information processing capacity of young BDs. The
presence of this anomalous EEG pattern in young non-
dependent BDs with a relatively short history of consumption
could be due to more deleterious effects of alcohol on
still-in-development brains, perhaps by means of a delay
on neuromaturational processes. Finally, although additional
research involving the study of spontaneous EEG rhythms in
BDs is required, this abnormally elevated tonic neural activity
might act as a potential marker of early brain damage associated
with BD.
