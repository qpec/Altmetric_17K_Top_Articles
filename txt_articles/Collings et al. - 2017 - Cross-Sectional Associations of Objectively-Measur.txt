Abstract
Background The minimum intensity of physical activity
(PA) that is associated with favourable body composition
and cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) remains unknown.
Objective To investigate cross-sectional associations of
PA and sedentary time (ST) with body composition and
CRF in mid-childhood.
Methods PA, ST, body composition and CRF were mea-
sured in a population-based sample of 410 children (aged
7.6 ± 0.4 years). Combined heart-rate and
movement
sensing provided estimates of PA energy expenditure
(PAEE, kJ/kg/day) and time (min/day) at multiple fine-
grained metabolic equivalent (MET) levels, which were
also collapsed to ST and light PA (LPA), moderate PA
(MPA) and vigorous PA (VPA). Fat mass index (FMI, kg/
m2), trunk fat mass index (TFMI, kg/m2) and fat-free mass
index (FFMI, kg/m2.5) were derived from dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry. Maximal workload from a cycle
ergometer test provided a measure of CRF (W/kg FFM).
Linear regression and isotemporal substitution models were
used to investigate associations.
Results The cumulative time above 2 METs (221 J/min/
kg) was inversely associated with FMI and TFMI in both
sexes (p \ 0.001) whereas time spent above 3 METs was
positively
associated
with
CRF
(p B 0.002);
CRF
increased and adiposity decreased dose-dependently with
increasing MET levels. ST was positively associated with
FMI and TFMI (p \ 0.001) but there were inverse asso-
ciations between all PA categories (including LPA) and
adiposity (p B 0.002); the magnitude of these associations
depended on the activity being displaced in isotemporal
substitution models but were consistently stronger for
VPA. PAEE, MPA and to a greater extent VPA, were all
positively related to CRF (p B 0.001).
Conclusions PA exceeding 2 METs is associated with
lower adiposity in mid-childhood, whereas PA of 3 METs
is required to benefit CRF. VPA was most beneficial for
fitness and fatness, from a time-for-time perspective, but
displacing any lower-for-higher intensity may be an
important first-order public health strategy.

Key Points
The minimum intensity of physical activity that is
associated with favourable body composition and
cardiorespiratory fitness remains unknown.
This study found that a higher intensity of physical
activity was necessary to confer benefits to
cardiorespiratory fitness (
[
3 metabolic equivalents)
than to improve levels of total and truncal adiposity
(
[
2 metabolic equivalents) in children aged
6–8 years, but both associations were characterised
by a dose-dependent phenomenon.
Public health bodies might consider formulating
recommendations purely around the concept of
continuous dose-response relationships, as higher
intensity physical activity may be optimal for body
composition and cardiorespiratory fitness in mid-
childhood, but any right-shift in the intensity
distribution is likely to be beneficial.
1 Introduction
Excess childhood adiposity can exert negative health
effects across the life-course [1]. Preventive efforts such
as increased physical activity (PA) performed during
sensitive or critical time periods could help to curtail
incident obesity and associated sequelae [2]. One such
critical period may be mid-childhood (6–11 years), when
the incidence of childhood obesity is highest [3], and
when
mass-specific
cardiorespiratory
fitness
(CRF)
plateaus in boys and begins to progressively decline in
girls [4].
It has consistently been acknowledged that an inverse
cross-sectional association exists between moderate-to-
vigorous PA (MVPA) and child adiposity [5]. This is one
reason why MVPA is considered an important component
of
paediatric
obesity
prevention
[6]
and
C60 min
MVPA/day is recommended for general childhood health
[7, 8]. An additional reason is that MVPA is positively
related to CRF [9], another important marker of health
which seems to attenuate obesity-related co-morbidities
[10, 11]. Unfortunately, few children adhere to activity
recommendations [12, 13], and mid-childhood [14] and
beyond [15] is epitomised by declining PA levels alongside
escalating sedentary time (ST), despite guidance that ST
should be minimised [7].
It remains unknown, however, if total ST is related to fat
mass or fat-free mass (FFM) in young people independent
of the level of MVPA [16], and due to conflicting reports it
is unclear which exact PA intensities may confer benefits
for body composition and CRF [17–20]. As intensity per se
is a continuum, these questions need to be examined using
objective exposure data which offer the required granu-
larity to investigate the complete spectrum of objectively-
measured PA intensities [21]. In particular, the lowest
intensity range requires more attention. Light PA (LPA)
accounts for the majority of children’s awake time [21, 22],
but is often ignored [23] and consequently its merits remain
largely a mystery [24]. The same applies to the effects of
displacing one movement behaviour for equal time in
another, which is a burgeoning line of enquiry referred to
as isotemporal substitution [25]. At present, substituting ST
only with MVPA has been deemed favourable for child
adiposity [26, 27] and health-related fitness [27], but
additional studies are needed, particularly with better
characterisation of LPA. The influence of PA and ST
reallocations on CRF has not yet been investigated.
The objectives of this study were to examine the entire
activity intensity spectrum to establish the minimum
intensities of PA that are associated with lower adiposity
and higher CRF in mid-childhood, and to compare the
effects of time reallocations between ST and PA intensities
on these same outcomes. This information may assist the
development of more palatable activity guidelines for
children.
2 Subjects and Methods
2.1 Sample
This cross-sectional investigation used baseline data from
the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC)
770
P. J. Collings et al.
123
 study, a PA and diet intervention in the city of Kuopio,
Finland [28]. A population-based sample of 736 children
aged 6–8 years, from 16 primary schools, were invited to
take part in the study. Seventy percent of children accepted
(n = 512) and baseline measurements were conducted
between October 2007 and November 2009, prior to
commencement of the intervention. Participants did not
differ in age, sex distribution or body mass index – stan-
dard deviation score (BMI-SDS) from all children aged
6–8 years who started first grade in the primary schools of
Kuopio in 2007–2009, based on school health examination
data. Altogether, 410 children (202 boys) with a mean age
of 7.6 years and valid data for PA, ST, body composition
and CRF were included in these analyses. All but ten
children were White. All aspects of the PANIC study were
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the
Hospital District of Northern Savo. Written informed
consent was acquired from the parent/caregiver of each
child and every child provided assent to participation.
2.2 Assessment of Body Size and Composition
Trained staff measured children’s height (m) in the
Frankfurt plane without shoes with a wall-mounted sta-
diometer. Body weight (kg) was measured when in light
underwear by using calibrated digital scales (lnBody 720,
Biospace, Seoul, Korea) after an overnight fast and after
the bladder had been voided. Body mass index (kg/m2) was
calculated and z-scores created using standard growth
reference data [29]. Body fat mass (total and truncal, kg)
and FFM (kg) were measured by dual energy X-ray
absorptiometry (DXA, Lunar Prodigy Advance, GE Med-
ical Systems, Madison, WI, USA) [30]. Fat mass index
(FMI, kg/m2), trunk fat mass index (TFMI, kg/m2) and fat-
free mass index (FFMI, kg/m2.5) were subsequently derived
by dividing variables by heightn [31].
2.3 Assessment of Cardiorespiratory Fitness
As described elsewhere a maximal cycle ergometer test
was performed [32]. After warming up at 5 W, children
cycled at a cadence of 70–80 revolutions per min for 1 min
at 20 W, after which the workload steadily increased at a
rate of 1 W per 6 s until voluntary exhaustion. As an
indicator of CRF, peak workload was defined as the
workload (Watts, W) achieved upon exercise termination,
expressed relative to FFM. Heart rate was measured during
the cycle test using an online ECG system (Cardiosoft v6.5
Diagnostic System, GE Healthcare Medical Systems,
Freiburg, Germany) and the energy cost of the cycle
ergometer protocol was derived using a subsample of
participants who also had oxygen consumption measured
during
the
test
(n = 38).
The
cycle
ergometer
test
permitted individual calibration of heart rate to physical
activity energy expenditure [33].
2.4 Assessment of Physical Activity and Sedentary
Time
Subsequent to the cycle test, a combined heart rate and
movement sensor (Actiheart, CamNtech Ltd, Papworth,
UK) was initialised to collect data in 60 s epochs and was
attached to the chest using adhesive ECG electrodes in
preparation for free-living assessment. The device is
lightweight and waterproof and can be worn continuously
even while swimming, showering and sleeping [34]. Par-
ticipants were requested to wear the monitor for a mini-
mum of four consecutive days but some wore the monitor
for up to 9 days. As school children’s activity patterns
show variability between weekdays and weekends the wear
period was purposefully scheduled to encompass an entire
weekend [35].
Upon retrieving and downloading the combined sensor,
heart rate data were first cleaned [36] then individually
calibrated with parameters from the cycle test (slope,
intercept and flex heart rate point) and combined with trunk
acceleration in a branched equation model to estimate an
intensity time-series [33]. Fourteen children did not have a
valid cycle test; these children were assigned a group-level
calibration derived from all valid cycle tests and repre-
sented the average heart rate to energy expenditure
response for a given age, sex and sleeping heart rate.
Monitor non-wear was acknowledged by prolonged zero-
acceleration lasting [
90 min accompanied by non-physi-
ological heart rate, and activity estimates were adjusted
during summarisation to minimise diurnal bias arising from
non-wear
[37].
Physical
activity
energy
expenditure
(PAEE) was calculated by integration of the intensity time-
series, and the time distribution of activity intensity was
generated by using standard metabolic equivalents (METs)
in 0.5 increments. For these analyses, the equivalent of
5.5 ml O2/min/kg (110.5 J/min/kg) was used to define
resting metabolic rate (1 MET) [38, 39]. Data were also
collapsed to classic intensity bands; ST was defined as
B1.5 METs, and categories of LPA (1.5–3 METs), mod-
erate PA (MPA: [
3–6 METs) and vigorous PA (VPA: [
6
METs) were defined with common thresholds [24].
To derive sleep duration, a single reviewer scrutinised
all activity plots to identify the timing of sleep onset
(considered to be steadily declining heart rate to a persis-
tently low level accompanied by prolonged minimal
movement) and termination (abruptly increasing heart rate
combined with movement onset following an extended
barren period) on a day-to-day basis during overnight
periods. Sleep duration (h/night) was included in analyses
as a potential confounding factor [40]. To separate sleep
Activity, Body Composition and Fitness in Childhood
771
123
 and ST, the average daily sleep duration was subtracted
from the average daily time in B1.5 METs.
Valid PA was defined as records containing C48-h data,
with C32 and C16 observed weekday and weekend hours,
respectively. It was further required that data were repre-
sented by C12 h of morning, noon, afternoon and evening
wear time. This caveat regarding the time-distribution of
observed data shielded against bias from over-representa-
tion of specific parts of days and optimised the diurnal bias
minimisation procedure [41]. The proportion of total wear
arising from weekends and the timing (season) of activity
measurements was captured.
2.5 Other Assessments
Parents reported their child’s age, sex, birth weight and the
household income of the highest earner in euros; partici-
pants were classified as belonging to low (
\
30,000 €),
middle (30,000 to \
60,000 €) or high (C60,000 €) annual
income families. Parents reported their weight (kg) and
height (m) at the baseline assessment and parental BMI
was calculated. Following detailed instruction from a
nutritionist, parents completed a 4-day food record for their
child. The food record included an entire weekend and
nutrient intakes were calculated using the Micro Nutrica�
dietary analysis program, version 2.5 (Social Insurance
Institution of Finland, Turku, Finland) with recent updates
in the nutrition composition database. For this specific
analysis, total energy intake (kJ/day) and fat intake (g/day)
were regarded as potentially important confounding fac-
tors. Further information regarding eating pattern was
collected
with
the
parent-reported
Children’s
Eating
Behaviour Questionnaire, which has been validated in
diverse groups [42, 43]. Children were classified as ‘every
day’ or ‘irregular’ breakfast consumers, eating ‘three’ or
‘fewer than three’ main meals daily, and according to their
snacking habit (
\
2, 2–3 or [
3 snacks daily).
2.6 Statistics
This investigation was restricted to participants with valid
data for PA, ST, body composition and CRF. To describe
the
sample,
summary
statistics
were
calculated
(mean ± standard
deviation
for
normal
distributions,
median (inter-quartile range) for skewed distributions, and
percentages for categories). Sex comparisons were made
using linear (continuous variables) or logistic (categorical
variables) regression accounting for school clustering with
robust standard errors. Spearman’s correlations were cal-
culated between all activity categories. To compare the
characteristics of contributing children to non-contributors
(excluded due to missing exposure and/or outcome data),
linear or logistic regression with robust standard errors was
used, adjusted for sex and age when these were not the
variables of interest.
To allow for missing data in some covariates for 77
children (19 % of the sample; mainly parental BMI was
missing), multiple imputation by chained equations was
used to investigate associations of PA and ST with body
composition and CRF. Ten imputed datasets were created
and linear regression analysis performed, again using
robust standard errors [44]. Crude models were initially
analysed, as were minimally adjusted models controlling
only for monitor wear characteristics (the proportion of
weekend data and season of measurement). Adjustment for
demographic variables was subsequently made (age, sex,
household income; ethnicity was not included due to low
variation) followed by adjustment for behaviours (sleep
duration, energy intake, frequency of breakfast consump-
tion, number of meals per day, snacking). In a further
model, birth weight and parental BMI were included.
Lastly, for models with body composition as outcomes,
adjustment for CRF was made, and models with CRF as the
outcome were adjusted for FMI.
The above described models were first used to investi-
gate associations of the cumulative time (min/day) above
single MET activity intensities (that is the total time spent
in activity [
1 MET, [
2 METs, [
3 METs and so on up to
[
7 METs; each intensity occupied a single model) with
FMI, TFMI, FFMI and CRF. Models were then used to
investigate associations of the broader ST and PA intensity
bands and PAEE with the same outcomes. In this second
analysis two primary models were constructed. The first
was adjusted for all aforementioned factors added to
models in the order already described (monitor wear
characteristics followed by demographics, behavioral fac-
tors, birth weight, parental BMI, FMI or CRF). The second
model (not applicable to PAEE) was built in the same
manner, but from the outset mutual adjustment for each of
the PA intensities was performed by simultaneously
including LPA, MPA and VPA in the linear predictor. The
results for this second model, which is constrained to the
non-variant 24-h per day by also adjusting for sleep dura-
tion and leaving out only ST, represent isotemporal sub-
stitution; the effect on the outcome of exchanging a unit of
ST for PA (inverting the results represents the effect of
exchanging a unit of PA for ST). To cover all isotemporal
eventualities the omitted variable alternated across all
activity intensities [25]. All results have been scaled to
represent the association between exposures and outcomes
per 10 unit (min/day; or kJ/kg/day for PAEE) difference in
exposures. Owing to skewed distributions, FMI and TFMI
were natural log-transformed prior to analyses and have
been back-transformed to represent the percentage differ-
ence
in
outcomes
[formula = ((exp(b 9 10) -
1) 9 100)]. All models were tested for effect modification

 by sex. Plots of residuals were reviewed and multi-
collinearity was checked by variance inflation factors.
Statistical analyses were conducted in Stata/SE 13.1 (Sta-
taCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Results with p values
\
0.05 were deemed statistically significant.
3 Results
3.1 Sample Description
Table 1 describes the 410 participants (49 % boys) with
valid data for PA, ST, body composition and CRF. Girls
weighed less and were shorter, and had lower birth weight
and energy and fat intake than boys. Non-participants
(n = 102) were characterised by a greater proportion of
boys
(61.8 %,
p = 0.024)
and
were
older
(7.7
vs.
7.6 years, p = 0.042) compared to children who con-
tributed to the analysis.
Table 2 provides summary data for PA, ST, body
composition and CRF. The mean (± standard deviation)
duration of monitor wear was 111.8 (± 32.5) hours,
equivalent
to
4.7
(± 1.4)
full
days,
and
one-third
(32.5 ± 12.1 %) of all data were from weekends; monitor
non-wear was minimal with an average 1438 (± 4.6)
min/day of data registered by devices from a possible
1440 min/day. Compared to boys, girls were characterised
by higher levels of LPA, FMI and TFMI, but lower levels
of higher-intensity PA (CMPA), PAEE, FFMI and CRF.
Sex differences remained after adjusting CRF for the sea-
son of assessment, and adjusting PA and ST variables for
the proportion of weekend data and season. Figure 1 pro-
vides a pictorial representation of the cumulative intensity
distribution during awake time, showing an exponential
decline in time as a function of intensity. Spearman’s
analysis showed that the strongest correlation for time-
based exposures was between ST and LPA (r = -0.76,
p \ 0.001). MPA and VPA were also strongly correlated

3.2 Cumulative Intensity Analyses
With the exception of CRF, there was no consistent evi-
dence for sex-interactions of the associations between
cumulative intensity distributions and outcomes. Figure 2
therefore shows associations for body composition that are
based on the whole sample, whereas results for CRF are
stratified by sex. Associations are adjusted for covariates,
including mutual adjustment for body composition and
CRF which did not alter the results. Time spent above 2
METs was inversely associated with FMI and TFMI
(Fig. 2a, b; p B 0.006) but there was no consistent evi-
dence for associations between MET values and FFMI
(Fig. 2c). In Fig. 2d, the cumulative time above 3 METs

CRF were all characterised by a graded dose-response
relationship with the greatest returns achieved from
increasing activity intensity beyond 7 METs; every 10 min
of PA [
7 METs was associated with approximately
26–30 % lower FMI and TFMI, and a higher CRF of 0.17
and 0.62 W/kg FFM in boys and girls, respectively
(p B 0.006 for all).
3.3 Categorical Analyses and Isotemporal
Substitution Models
Associations between classical ST and PA categories with
outcomes are shown in Table 3. There was no consistent
evidence of sex-interactions. In Model 1, independent of
covariates including CRF, ST was positively associated,
and LPA, MPA and VPA were all significantly inversely
associated, with adiposity; the magnitude of associations
were largely equivalent for FMI and TFMI, and strongest
for VPA. PAEE was also inversely associated with adi-
posity. Regardless of adjustment for CRF there was no
indication that any activity parameter was related to FFMI.
There were also no associations between ST and LPA with
CRF. Conversely, MPA and VPA displayed positive
associations with CRF, and the association was strongest
for VPA. PAEE was also positively associated with CRF,
independent of adiposity. The isotemporal substitution
results (Model 2) revealed that substituting ST with LPA or
MPA was inversely associated with FMI and TFMI, but if
the same amount of time was instead shifted from ST to
VPA, the association was much stronger; exchanging
10 min ST/day for VPA/day equated to approximately
12–13 % lower total and truncal fatness. Swapping LPA or
MPA with VPA was also significantly inversely associated
with FMI and TFMI, to approximately the same magni-
tudes. Consistent with Model 1 there were no significant
associations for FFMI. With respect to CRF, there was no
evidence of an association for substituting ST with LPA,
but exchanging ST or LPA with MPA was positively
associated with CRF. The greatest impacts on CRF, how-
ever, came from shifting ST, LPA and MPA into VPA.
All results were materially similar when adjusted for sex
and age and without these adjustments, thereby providing
reassurance that results were not biased by exclusion of

4 Discussion
This study of 410 Finnish children aged 6–8 years has
replicated the consistent cross-sectional finding of an
inverse association between MVPA and child adiposity
[5, 16]. However, by investigating the spectrum of inten-
sities, we uniquely found that exceeding an intensity of at
least 2 METs (i.e. a PA intensity [
110.5 J/min/kg above
resting) was inversely associated with DXA-derived FMI
and TFMI. Accompanying this observation, exchanging
daily ST for LPA was associated with lower total and
truncal adiposity. Nonetheless, higher-intensity activity
conferred greater benefit per unit time, as has been shown
elsewhere [19]. Isotemporal substitution models anchored
on ST showed that for equivalent reductions in adiposity
the time requirement for VPA was 7–10 times shorter than
LPA and MPA. Likewise, to attain equivalent gains in
CRF, sevenfold less VPA than MPA, substituted for ST,
was needed.
We have previously shown in a UK cohort of adoles-
cents that LPA can substantially contribute to PAEE [21],
but its association with child adiposity has remained lar-
gely equivocal. Some studies have reported inverse asso-
ciations between objectively-measured LPA and markers
of childhood fatness [45–47]. Others have reported no such
relation [19, 20, 26, 27, 48–51]. These inconsistencies may
simply relate to how LPA has been defined, but it is
noteworthy that most studies reporting an inverse associ-
ation for LPA have measured fatness by DXA, whereas
studies with null results have more frequently used proxy
measures such as BMI or waist circumference, therefore
measurement error may account for some of the null
findings [52]. Our data suggest that adequate LPA may be
an effective, but not optimal, means of maintaining total
and truncal adiposity levels and offsetting unhealthy fat
gain in mid-childhood. Importantly, the data further high-
light that LPA is accessible regardless of FFMI and CRF
levels; we found no association between LPA and any
other activity parameter with FFMI (as shown previously in
pre-schoolers [51]) and LPA was not associated with CRF
which concurs with results from elsewhere [19, 20, 46].
Contrasting the results for LPA, we observed that MPA
and VPA were both inversely associated with adiposity and
also positively associated with CRF, with the magnitude of
associations being largest for VPA. In agreement we found
that the cumulative time above 3 METs was positively
associated with CRF in a dose-dependent manner. Our data
partially concur with those of others, who similarly found
that MPA and VPA were both positively associated with
CRF, but concluded that only VPA was associated with
body fatness [17–19]. Our results indicate that MPA, and
particularly VPA within a restricted time budget, may be
the optimal intensity domains for improving adiposity and
CRF levels in children. We also found that PAEE was
inversely associated with FMI and TFMI, and positively
related to CRF, which raises the question whether PAEE
may mediate the reported associations of MPA and VPA
with adiposity or CRF. Given the compositional nature of
PAEE being made up of all intensities, both MPA and VPA
were strongly positively correlated with PAEE, which
made it inappropriate to mutually adjust for these param-
eters in analyses. Under the naı
¨ve assumption of everything
else being equal (most notably energy intake) it is con-
ceivable that PA volume may be the decisive factor for
body composition and not intensity per se. Nevertheless,
there are many biologically plausible arguments as to why
activity intensity may be important for adiposity over and
above energy expenditure, including appetite regulation
and the lag-effect of increased post-activity resting meta-
bolism [51]. For these reasons, future work should try to
clarify if activity intensity is related to adiposity indepen-
dent of PA volume. Potentially this could be achieved by
estimating the substitution effect of energy expended at one
intensity level for energy expended at another intensity
[26]. With regard to CRF, there is increasing acceptance
that only MVPA, and in particular VPA, can incite
improvements [17–20].
Categorical analyses (Table 3) revealed that ST was
positively associated with total and truncal adiposity in
both
sexes.
Isotemporal
substitution
models
further
revealed that replacing ST with an equal volume of LPA or
MPA, and more so VPA, was beneficial for body compo-
sition.
This
contrasts
reports
based
on
awake-time
accelerometry which indicate that replacing ST only with
MVPA is favourable for childhood adiposity [26, 27]. The
difference may be that the current study utilised uninter-
rupted (24-h/day) combined heart rate and movement
sensing to better characterise ST and all categories of PA,
including LPA. For CRF there were null effects of sub-
stituting ST with LPA, but replacing ST or LPA with time-
equivalent MPA was positively associated with CRF, and
the magnitude of association was larger if time was sub-
stituted for VPA. Therefore, VPA seems to confer the most
benefit for fitness on the basis of like-for-like time dis-
placement with ST or other PA intensities. It should nev-
ertheless be considered that displacing ST for VPA, for
example, would likely constitute a challenging public
health proposal given the current obesity and inactivity

 pandemics, which are set inside what has been termed a
‘slothogenic’ environment and society [53]. Potentially a
more reasonable and achievable first goal would be to
focus on displacing ST in favour of any PA intensity for
lower adiposity, whilst emphasising the greater returns
offered by higher-intensity PA (of at least moderate and
particularly vigorous intensity), such as further improved
body composition and elevated CRF. The results for adi-
posity and CRF were independent of one another, implying
that the reported benefits of PA for weight management
and fitness would likely extend widely to children regard-
less of these factors.
Strengths of this study include the population-based
sample of children, a maximal cycle ergometer test for
CRF evaluation, combined-sensing estimates of ST and PA
with individual calibration of heart rate, and measurement
of body composition by DXA. Many studies have used
DXA as a criterion standard and it is a superior technique
to field-based methods [54]. Combined-sensing also out-
performs accelerometry or heart-rate alone in estimating
PAEE [37, 55, 56] and low-to-moderate PA [57]. It is
unfortunate, nonetheless, that a relatively short observation
period was used, meaning that we might not have captured
representative ST and PA profiles for all children. This
could have biased the reported associations toward the null,
suggesting that the true associations may be even stronger
than we report. Although we controlled for many variables
that were plausibly related to exposures and outcomes
(including dietary consumption, eating patterns, and sleep
duration, which is recommended [26] but rarely achieved)
residual confounding is a potential issue in all observa-
tional studies. It is also a weakness that the direction of
association between variables is indeterminable due to the
cross-sectional study design. This is particularly problem-
atic because bidirectional associations may exist between
exposures and outcomes; thus our results may equally
imply that fitter and less fat children have more favourable
ST and PA profiles. Longitudinal studies are needed in
larger and more representative samples.
5 Conclusion
This study found that a higher intensity of PA was neces-
sary to confer benefits to CRF (
[
3 METs) than to improve
body composition (
[
2 METs), but both associations were
ultimately characterised by a dose-dependent phenomenon.
It therefore seems that LPA can benefit child body com-
position but at least moderate intensity PA is required for
higher fitness. Vigorous PA will provide the greatest time
investment returns for both fitness and fatness, but ST
should not be ignored as it was positively associated with
both total and truncal adiposity. It seems that a pertinent
starting point for public health bodies would be to formu-
late recommendations purely around the concept of dose-
dependent relationships; health benefits can be derived
from higher doses of PA, achieved either through longer
duration or higher intensity or both. If time is a limiting
factor, activity at higher intensity offers an efficient inter-
vention strategy but any right-shift in the intensity distri-
bution is likely to be beneficial.
