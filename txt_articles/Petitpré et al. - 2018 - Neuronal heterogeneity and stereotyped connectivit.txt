Spiral ganglion (SG) neurons of the cochlea convey all auditory inputs to the brain, yet the
cellular and molecular complexity necessary to decode the various acoustic features in the SG
has remained unresolved. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we identify four types of SG
neurons, including three novel subclasses of type I neurons and the type II neurons, and
provide a comprehensive genetic framework that define their potential synaptic commu-
nication patterns. The connectivity patterns of the three subclasses of type I neurons with
inner hair cells and their electrophysiological profiles suggest that they represent the
intensity-coding properties of auditory afferents. Moreover, neuron type specification is
already established at birth, indicating a neuronal diversification process independent of
neuronal activity. Thus, this work provides a transcriptional catalog of neuron types in the
cochlea, which serves as a valuable resource for dissecting cell-type-specific functions of
dedicated afferents in auditory perception and in hearing disorders.

he perception of sound is essential to receive information
from our environment, and to communicate and interact
socially. Hair cells (HCs) in the cochlea transduce sound
and convey its signal to the central nervous system via chemical
synapses on the spiral ganglion (SG) neurons dendrites1,2. The
central afferents of these SG neurons converge to form the
auditory nerve, which connects to the cochlear nuclei in the
brainstem. The auditory nerve is the sole supply route of auditory
information from HCs to the brain, and contained processed
information about sound frequency, intensity, timbre, and pitch
which are all necessary for perceptual sound detections, dis-
criminations, and recognitions centrally3–5. However, the cellular
basis of the processing and routing of these auditory qualities at
the periphery are still poorly understood.
Processing of the sound signal in the auditory nerve has been
hypothesized to originate in the diversity of biophysical prop-
erties of type I SG neuron fibers (95% of auditory afferents). For
instance, frequency specific stimulus activation of specific
groups of afferents has been shown to reflect the contribution of
different SG fibers with distinct temporal discharge pat-
terns3,6,7. Another example of auditory fibers diversity is the
intensity driven activation of selective auditory afferents5,8,9,
where at least two populations of auditory fibers can be dis-
tinguished on the basis of their threshold activity: the low
threshold (LT) fibers and the high threshold (HT) fibers.
Additionally, HT fibers have wide range of sensitivity to sound
levels which has been suggested to encode the enormous range
of intensities in the auditory system5,8. Thus, since cochlear
transduction depends on an interaction between mechanical
processes but also the electrical properties of auditory afferents,
we need to understand how these, which are foundational for
the auditory experience, contribute more specifically to decode
the various features of the incoming sound and how their
dysfunction may lead to neural hearing impairments.
To further unravel the mechanisms of sound processing in the
peripheral auditory system, we used single-cell RNA sequencing
(scRNAseq) combined with genetic labeling to fully uncover the
molecular types of SG neurons. We identified four types of
neurons, including three novel subclasses of type I neurons and
the type II neurons, along with numerous new marker genes and
provided a comprehensive genetic framework that may shape
their synaptic communication patterns. Second, using newly
identified markers, we characterized the differential projection
patterns of the distinct subclasses of type I neurons to the inner
hair cells (IHCs), the actual sensory receptors, and recorded their
electrophysiological properties. Finally, a similar analysis on
developing SG neurons provided evidence of their perinatal
diversification, before the onset of hearing, as well as distinctive
expression patterns of key signaling pathway components pre-
dictive of this functional diversification. More generally, our study
unveils a large molecular heterogeneity in the cochlear afferent
system that delineates previously uncharacterized neuron types,
which likely represent discrete ascending channels that convey
distinct auditory information. In addition, it also constitutes a

 toolbox to develop genetic approaches to examine the function of
the different SG neuron types in hearing.
Results
scRNAseq identifies new neuron types in the cochlea. The
majority of SG neurons are type I neurons; they are myelinated,
contact the inner hair cells (IHCs) and are the principal carrier of
the auditory signal. The other minority population (5%) of neu-
rons are called type II neurons; they are unmyelinated and
innervate the outer hair cells (OHCs), which modulate the output
of the organ of Corti1. The few in vitro studies on their function
indicate they could report cochlear trauma10,11.
To identify neuron types in adult SG neurons, a total of 487
tdTomato positive (TOM+) cells from PVCre;R26TOM cochlea of
postnatal stage 17 (P17), P21, and P33 were processed for single-
cell transcriptome analysis (Fig. 1a–c). Note that all SG neurons
express parvalbumin (PV) and are TOM+ after recombination
(Fig. 1a). The cell expression data were clustered using R package
SEURAT and
visualized using bi-dimensional
t-distributed
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), showing four distinct
neuronal types (Fig. 1d–e). The type II neurons represented the
smallest cluster and were identified by their expression of the
known markers Prph12 (peripherin) and Th13 (Fig. 1e–f). We
confirmed the type I identity of the three other clusters (thereafter
named Ia, Ib, and Ic types) by their high expression of the
transcription factor Prox114 and lack of Prph (Fig. 1e, Supple-
mentary Fig. 1a). Importantly, our initial clustering showed that
these neuron type identities were conserved at P17, P21, and P33
(Supplementary Fig. 1b).
We next explored this data set to identify novel markers of
the four types of SG neurons (Fig. 1f, Supplementary Fig 1c;
Supplementary Data 1, 2). All type I neurons (Ia, Ib, and Ic)
were characterized by the expression of Slc17a6 (VGlut1),
Trpm2, Epha4, and abundant levels of Prox1, and the type II
population, by its expression of Prph, Npy (neuropeptide Y),
Th, Piezo2, and high levels of Cux2. The different subclasses of
type I neurons could be further distinguished based on unique
and combinatorial molecular profiles. Type Ia expressed Runx1,
Ttn (Titin), Calb1 and 2 (calretinin, CR), and low levels of
Pou4f1 (Brn3a). Type Ib was characterized by the expression of
Grm8 (mGluR8), Kcnc2 (Kv3.2), Lypd1, Runx1, and abundant
levels of Pou4f1. Finally, type Ic expressed Trim54 (MuRF3),
Rxrg and high levels of Calb2. We next confirmed in vivo the
existence of the four types of SG neurons by validating the
expression of genes enriched in specific cell types using
combinatorial labeling with new markers and transgenic mouse
lines (Fig. 1g). In addition, we analyzed the soma size of each
neuronal type (Fig. 1h) and calculated the percentage of each
type
along
the
baso-apical
axis
of
the
cochlea,
which
physiologically reflects the tonotopic gradient necessary for
encoding frequency specificity within the auditory nerve8,15.
Using different combinations of newly identified specific
markers, the proportion of the four neuron types was found
to be relatively constant throughout the length of the cochlea:
7% for type II, 26% for type Ia, 24% for type Ib, and 43% for
type Ic (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Fig. 1d-f). Also, we could not
observe any specific spatial patterning within the SG of any of
the type I neurons subclasses (Supplementary Fig. 1f-g).
Together, these results demonstrate the existence and validate
markers of four types of SG neurons. We investigate below the
transcriptional basis that contributes to define their distinct
neuronal identity.

 Comparative analysis of SG neurons. To get insights into the
major differences between the four types of SG neurons, we first
conducted gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the two most
distinct populations, i.e., type I and type II neurons. While highly
enriched gene ontology (GO) terms were associated with neu-
ronal cell functions, such as “neurotransmission”, “ion transport”,
and “axogenesis”, the most enriched category in the type I group
was “metabolism” (Fig. 2a, c, d), likely reflecting the large energy
demand of the myelinated type I neurons to ensure their high
sensitivity and temporal fidelity16,17. Also, this analysis identified
an enrichment of genes among the unmyelinated type II neurons
involved in “response to stress” and “pain” mechanisms (Fig. 2b),
which is consistent with their activation by cochlear damage11.
To further complete the characterization of the four types of
SG neurons, we carried out a comparative analysis of their
differential expression of transcription factors, adhesion, and
cytoskeleton molecules. While numerous genes were specifically
expressed in type II neurons, a strict ON/OFF division amongst
the three subclasses of type I neurons was rarely observed
(Fig. 2e–g, Supplementary Fig. 2), likely reflecting the importance
of a combinatorial basis of the code specifying a cell type.
Neurotransmission-related machinery in SG neurons. We next
analyzed in more detail gene families implicated in generic neu-
ronal
transmission,
including
voltage-gated
ion
channels
(VGICs),
synaptic
vesicle
complex,
neurotransmitter
(NT)
receptors and transporters, and calcium-binding proteins, as they
all participate in the classification of neuron types by regulating
their electrophysiological profile (Fig. 3a–c). SG neurons respond
mainly to glutamate released by HCs16,18. Interestingly, the
relative expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluR)—
AMPA
(Gria),
Kainate
(Grik),
and
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) (Grin) receptors—and of metabotropic glutamate
receptors (mGluRs, Grm) was particularly heterogeneous between
the type I and type II neurons. Only type I neurons were found to
express mGluRs (Grm7 in all three type I, and Grm8 only in type
Ib) which are mostly pre-synaptic and decrease neurotransmitter
release at the central synapse19 (Fig. 3a–f, Supplementary Figs. 3
and 4a,b). Also, while type I neurons exhibited a homogeneous
pattern of iGluR expression, Gria3 and Grin1 were expressed at
much lower levels in type II neurons than in all other types,
whereas type II neurons instead specifically expressed Grik3,
Grin2c, and 3a. Grik4 and 5 were detected in all subtypes, albeit at
very low levels. These results suggest that type II neurons use both
AMPA and Kainate receptors, while type I neurons rely mainly
on AMPA receptors, as previously shown16,18. Moreover, the
distinct composition of NMDARs subunits suggests cell-type-
dependent activation of different sets of NMDARs-interacting
molecules20. Thus, together with the morphological differences of
the OHC-type II afferent synapse, the different expression of
iGluR by type II neurons could participate in vivo in establishing
their distinct synaptic responses; the frequency of synaptic events
and the size of synaptic potentials are considerably smaller in type
II afferent dendrites compared to type I afferents10,21.
The electrophysiological properties of neurons are shaped by
the expression of several families of VGICs, which include the
sodium (Nav), potassium (Kv), calcium (Cav) channels, and the
hyperpolarization-activated

 channels22. VGICs exhibited extensive differential expression
profiles amongst the different types of SG neurons, sharply
distinguishing type II from type I neurons (Fig. 3a–f). Although
Cav, Nav, and HCN channels families showed modest differences
amongst the different subclasses of type I neurons, Kv channels
differed substantially in these neuron types. Activation of Kv
channels shapes the pattern of neuronal firing and excitability
and drives the rate of adaptation to sustained stimuli23. Their
differential expression could participate in the expected distinct
physiological characteristics of the different subclasses of type I
neurons5,8,24 (Fig. 3d–f and Supplementary Fig. 4a and b).
The excitability of auditory afferents is also regulated by the
lateral and medial olivocochlear (LOC and MOC) efferents which
innervate respectively the type I and type II peripheral endings
underneath the HCs and modulate their sensitivity1,2,25. Note
that the MOC efferents make also direct synaptic contacts with
OHCs. The MOC system is cholinergic and GABAergic while the
LOC system can be divided into at least cholinergic and
dopaminergic components and also contain serotonin, GABA
and many neuropeptides, including enkephalins, dynorphins, and
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)25,26. Surprisingly, the
receptors for these peptides were absent from all SG neurons, as
were dopamine receptors, with the exception of Drd5 that was
expressed in type II neurons, and Drd1a in type Ib neurons, albeit
both at low levels (Supplementary Fig. 4c). The ionotropic
GABAA receptor subunit Gabrb3 and metabotropic receptor
Gabbr1/2 (GABAB1/2) were uniformly expressed amongst SG
neurons. In contrast, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs,
which are ionotropic) were differentially expressed: Chrnb2 in all
SG neurons, Chrna7 in type II and Chrna4 in type Ic, all at low
levels in general. Interestingly, only the type II neurons expressed
serotonin receptors (mostly Htr2c and 7) (Fig. 3b; Supplementary
Fig. 4c). Thus, with regards to the very low abundance of
receptors for acetylcholine (Ach), dopamine, and opioids, these
results suggest that the prevalent negative feedback control of SG
afferents activity is GABAergic, through both ionotropic and
metabotropic receptors. In parallel, a serotonergic positive
feedback could also modulate the type II neurons (Fig. 3d–f).
One of the ways by which the strength of activation of a
synapse can be modulated is by regulating neurochemical delivery
by pre-synaptic terminal through actions on exocytosis27. During
this process, the cooperation between Synaptotagmins (Syt),

 Slc17a7 (VGLUT1) in type I afferents enables efficient recovery of
synaptic vesicles during prolonged stimulation28 (Fig. 3b, Sup-
plementary Fig. 4c). In addition, by regulating calcium avail-
ability, which triggers the fusion step27, the differential expression
of calcium-binding proteins could also participate in the distinct
firing dynamics of SG neurons29 (Fig. 3c).
Altogether, our data provide core molecular features of SG
neuron types whose differential expression may underlie their
input–output communication properties.
Electrophysiological profiles of type I neurons. We next asked
whether the three distinct subclasses of type I SG neurons also
exhibit
unique
electrophysiological
properties.
Whole-cell
recordings were made from isolated SG neurons after dissocia-
tion to capture their key electrophysiological properties at the
soma level. Analysis of current-clamp recordings revealed a high
degree of diversity amongst the 133 recorded neurons in terms of
action potential firing patterns and intrinsic passive and active
properties. Two main groups could be easily distinguished based
on their accommodation rate to step current injections: unitary
spike accommodating/phasic cells (UA, n = 107 cells, 80% of
neurons) and multiple spikes accommodating cells (MA, n = 26
cells, 20% of neurons, also characterized by a sustained firing over
200 ms long current steps) (Supplementary Fig. 5a), as shown at
earlier stages24. UA cells were not able to fire more than a single
action potential in response to a prolonged depolarizing step,
while MA fired multiple action potentials with frequencies that
increased by incrementing current intensity (Supplementary
Fig. 5a). Post hoc immunostaining on 50 cells revealed that all Ia
and Ic neurons (28 TOM+/CR+ neurons in a PVCre;R26TOM
context) corresponded to UA type (Fig. 4a, b, e–g, Supplementary
Fig. 5b), while the Ib population (22 TOM+/CR− neurons) was
equally comprising either UA (11 cells) or MA type (11 cells)
(Fig. 4c, d, e–g) raising the possibility that the Ib type could be
further subdivided. Moreover, neurons with an MA profile
showed high variability in the number of spikes they fired with
prolonged depolarization current (Fig. 4h).
To further describe the two SG neuron populations, we
performed a more detailed analysis of their action potential
properties. Only the Ib neurons with a MA profile differed
significantly in most analyzed parameters (Fig. 4i–j, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5c). In general, UA cells exhibited higher depolarization
threshold compared to MA cells, their resting membrane
potential was more hyperpolarized and they required stronger
current injections to discharge action potentials. MA cells fired in
response to smaller current injections, responded slowly and with
a longer latency and had wider action potentials. Also, a slow
after-hyperpolarization (AHP) was more prominent among MA
cells.
Other
distinctive
features
of
MA
cells
were
their
pronounced rectification of the current–voltage (I–V) relation-
ship, larger Ih-mediated sag, shorter membrane time constant,
and a high variability in their maximal frequency discharge,
reaching up to 106 Hz (mean = 51 Hz).
To correlate the physiological data of SG neurons to their
molecular profile, we found that Kcnc2 (Kv3.2) exhibited a
contrasted expression profile in type Ib neurons, identifying two
populations, which reinforces the possibility of a subdivision of
type Ib in two subtypes (Supplementary Fig. 5d). One did not
express Kcnc2 while the other expressed variable levels of Kcnc2.
Kv3.2 has been shown to play an important role for sustaining
repetitive firing23,30. Thus, these two populations could refer to
the UA and MA types of Ib neurons, respectively. In line with
this, type Ia and Ic neurons, which are UA type, did not express
Kcnc2 (Supplementary Fig. 5d). To the best of our analysis, Kcnc2
was the only candidate gene in our neurotransmission-related
gene data set to show this contrasted expression in type Ib
neurons. In view of the importance of Kv3 channels in the
regulation of the firing properties of neurons31, it will be

 interesting to assess in vitro and in vivo the role of Kv3.2 in the
physiology of type Ib neurons and in hearing.
Although our data obtained on dissociated neurons do not
reflect the actual biophysical properties of the post-synaptic SG
neurons during synaptic transmission of inputs from IHCs, they
do demonstrate a high heterogeneity of electrophysiological
properties among SG neuron types. These neuron types could
conceivably correspond to the auditory units with distinct
thresholds to sound stimulation in vivo5,8.
Spatial segregation of type I afferent terminals. Multiple type I
afferents (10–20 in mice) receive input from one IHC32—in
comparison, a single type II neuron receives input from a dozen
of outer HCs (OHCs)1. Remarkably, the position of these type I
afferent terminals around the IHC circumference determines
the fibers’ threshold sensitivity8,33,34. Fibers with high thresh-
olds (HT afferents) to acoustic stimuli have been shown to
contact the modiolar side (facing the modiolus) of the IHC
while those with lower acoustic thresholds (LT afferents), their
opposite, pillar side (facing the pillar cells)8,9,34,35 (see scheme
in Fig. 5a). Differences in threshold sensitivity are important for
expanding the dynamic range of the cochlea, and would provide
a means for discriminating sounds in a background noise5,34.
They also strongly suggest the existence of distinct ascending
circuits and, consistent with this, specialized neuron types. To

 test whether the molecular differences we identified between SG
neuron types could underlie the cellular basis of this functional
diversity, we first made use of the high expression of Pou4f1
(Brn3a) in type Ib neurons to selectively trace their nerve
endings below IHCs using Brn3aCreERT2;R26TOM mice and
limiting tamoxifen exposure (a single injection at P21) (Fig. 5b).
Indeed, a single injection of tamoxifen in P21 Brn3aCreERT2;
R26TOM mice lead to a sparse labeling of mostly type Ib neurons
at P30 (94% of RFP+ type I neurons are Ib neurons, with 25%
efficiency
within
the
Ib
population).
Combined
with
CR immunostaining to label the projections of type Ia and Ic
neurons, this sparse labeling strategy revealed on cross-sections
and in cochlea whole mount that TOM+ Ib fibers consistently
innervated the modiolar side of IHC, while CR+ Ia and Ic
fibers, the pillar side (Fig. 5c, Supplementary Fig. 6a-c).
Importantly, both CR and TOM positive fibers did not co-
localize with synaptotagmin positive pre-synaptic nerve end-
ings underneath the IHCs, excluding the possibility that
these
fibers
were
efferents
(Supplementary
Fig.
6b-c-e).
A quantitative analysis of CR+ (only in Ia/Ic neurons) vs PV+
(in all neurons) fibers underneath the IHCs in cochlea whole
mount of WT mice further confirmed the specific projection of
Ib neurons to the modiolar and of the Ia/Ic neurons to the pillar
(Ia/Ic) side of the IHCs (Fig. 5d–f, Supplementary Fig. 6d-e).
Strikingly, the segregation of type I afferent projections was
already defined in the osseus spiral lamina region, where per-
ipheral axons of all SG neurons merge and project towards
the sensory epithelium (Fig. 5g). Thus, Ib fibers were system-
atically positioned on the scala vestibuli (SV) side of the
nerve bundle, while the Ia and Ic fibers, on the scala tympani
(ST) side. Altogether, these data demonstrate that genetically
distinct subclasses of type I SG neurons are associated with
specific peripheral projection profiles with IHCs that correlate
well with the distinction between LT and HT afferents8,34
(Fig. 5h).
Neuronal diversity in the cochlea is established at birth. In
mice, pups are born deaf and become responsive to sound sti-
mulation after P1036. Before the onset of hearing, neuronal
activity in the SG is triggered by IHCs spontaneous activity37,
which begins at about P4 and affects the maturation of the IHC-
afferent synapses and certainly of different other cell types in the
cochlea37–39. We therefore investigated the timing of establish-
ment of SG neurons diversity, with respect to this critical
maturation period. Unbiased clustering of 478 SG neurons from
P3 cochlea mice revealed again four distinct types of SG neurons,
in proportion similar (P > 0.05) to those observed in adult mice
(Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 7a-b). As in adult SG, the expression
of transcription factors such as Pou4f1 and Runx1 was specific to
the Ia and Ib types. The type Ic and II neurons were characterized
respectively by a specific, transient expression of Cxcl14 and Etv4
(PEA3) (Fig. 6b, c; Supplementary Fig. 7c), distinguishing the two
types from adult stages. Interestingly, both Epha4 and Prph,
described previously as early postnatal type I and type II neuron
markers respectively13,40, were more widely expressed, with
EphA4 found in all neuron types, and Prph, in both type II and Ic
neurons (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 7c-f; Supplementary Data 3,
4). Moreover, the four neuron types could be already identified at
P0 (Supplementary Fig. 7g), suggesting that the molecular path-
ways that specify the generation of the four SG neuron types
precede and are independent of the postnatal maturation of the
organ of Corti and of spontaneous or stimulus-driven activity.
Through GSEA of P3 SG neuron types, we observed that
“neurogenesis” and “morphogenesis/neuronal projection” were
among GO terms with the highest representation in type II
neurons (Fig. 6d). By contrast, the most enriched term in type I
neurons concerned genes associated with metabolism, as was
described earlier for the adult type I group (Fig. 6d). In line with
this, a correlation analysis of adult and P3 SG neuron types
revealed high similarity between the two stages (Fig. 6e–g). This

 neurotransmission (Fig. 6h, Supplementary Fig. 8), in which only
a few number of genes showed different expression between P3
and adult stages. These results strengthen the idea that functional
diversification of SG neuron types displayed prior to experience
includes mature and distinct synaptic communication signatures
that persist in adult neurons.
Cell-to-cell communication machinery in P3 SG neurons. We
next compared transcriptional differences amongst neonatal SG
neuron types, focusing on gene sets commonly involved in neu-
rodevelopmental processes, such as “axon guidance”, “adhesion”,
and “signaling molecules”. These most likely participate to the
establishment of their innervation pattern and to the specificity of
their synaptic connections with HCs (Fig. 7a), efferents and
central targets. As expected, the different types of SG neurons
exhibited various combinations of gene expression (Fig. 7b–d,
Supplementary Fig. 9). For instance, several genes of the Eph-
Ephrin families (Ephb1/3, Epha8, Efna1/5, Efnb1) were particu-
larly enriched in type II neurons, likely participating in the
intricate growth of their projections within the OHCs area
(Fig. 7a, b). Interestingly, several members of the cadherin, proto-
cadherin and contactin cell surface molecules, which are critical
in the control of synaptic partner specificity, displayed very dis-
tinct expression profiles across the four populations of neurons41
(Fig. 7b). In the cadherin family for instance, Cdh7 and 8 were
enriched in type Ib, Cdh9 in types Ia and Ic and Cdh4 and 13, in
type II neurons. For those categories of molecules, their relative
levels of expression in different neighboring cells can generate
discrete, local synaptic connection patterns. Thus, their interac-
tions between synaptic partners could participate in the correct
matching of each afferent types with particular cellular domains
of HCs and efferent endings during development42–44.
We also found that whereas all SG neurons expressed the
machinery necessary for the activation of the TGFB signaling,
many inhibitory modulators of this pathway (Smad6, Smad7,
Nog, Nbl1, Smad9, Smurf2) were particularly enriched in the type
II neurons, arguing for a specific role of this signaling only in type
I neurons (Fig. 7d, e). More generally, each of the major signaling
pathways manifested differential expression amongst SG neuron
types, highlighting their potential contribution to the character-
istic connection patterns and physiological properties of each cell
type.
Altogether, our results provide an extensive set of differentially
expressed genes among neonatal SG neurons that will help future
investigations of the molecular programs that control the
diversification and connection patterns of SG neuron types.
Discussion
Despite evidence supporting physiological diversity of primary
auditory neurons, their molecular identification and thus the
study of their individual function in the neuronal encoding of the
distinct properties of sounds has remained unresolved. Using
unbiased single-cell RNA profiling, morphological, and physio-
logical analyses, we provide evidence for molecularly distinct
types of auditory neurons in the cochlea as well as an extensive
resource for future studies in hearing research.
Our results identified four distinct types of adult SG neurons,
including three novel subclasses of type I neurons (Ia, Ib, and Ic
neurons) and the type II neurons, which can be distinguished
based on unique and combinatorial molecular profiles. These four
types of SG neurons exist at birth, which strongly suggests that
initial neuronal diversification in the cochlea is established by
molecular processes independent of neuronal activity or sensory
experience.
We found that a comprehensive analysis of the combinatorial
expression of genes involved in neuronal transmission reveals a
specific molecular profile of each neuron type that underlies their
unique transcriptional signature of input/output communication.
These particular profiles agree with well-studied physiological
properties of SG neurons, such as their metabolic status, pre-
ference
for
AMPA-mediated
or
kainate-mediated
synaptic
transmission or their expression of various VGICs or receptors to
efferent-derived neurotransmitters and neuromodulators2,16,18,25.
They further extend the molecular characterization of SG neurons
but also, more important, they provide an extensive cell to cell
phenotype that can be used to predict or confirm physiological
features.
For instance, the transcriptome of type II neurons suggests that
they would be part of a particular response to a local stress
(Fig. 2b), which is consistent with their activation by ATP and
closure of Kv7 potassium channels induced by damage of the
organ of Corti10,11. Interestingly, our data show that amongst Kv7
channels and purinergic receptors (P1, P2X, and P2Y receptors),
only Kcnq2 (Kv7.2) and P2rx4 (P2X4) and to a lesser extent,
P2rx7 (P2X7), which both code for ATP-gated ion channels (P2X
receptors), are expressed in adult type II neurons (Supplementary
Data 1). On the other hand, P2Y receptors, which are metabo-
tropic and can be activated by ATP or UTP, have been shown to
be upregulated in all SG neurons following noise trauma45. P2Y
receptors activation can regulate the excitability of neurons via
the inhibition of the M-current, which is mediated by members of
the Kv7 channels and reduces neuronal excitability46–49. Thus,
this suggests a two-step activation mechanism of type II neurons
following noxious noise exposure: a first through glutamate (via
AMPA/Kainate receptors) and ATP (via P2X receptors) released
from OHCs and the damaged organ of Corti, respectively, and a
second (likely delayed) by inactivating Kv7.2-mediated M-current
and thus sensitizing type II neurons through a specific UTP–P2Y
metabotropic pathway. Interestingly, we also discovered that
while serotonin is expressed in both the lateral and medial
efferent systems50, only the type II neurons express receptors for
serotonin (Htr2c and 7, coupled to Gq/G11 and Gs, respectively),
suggesting a third mode of type II neurons excitation or sensiti-
zation by serotonin receptor activation (Supplementary Fig. 10).
The diversity of type I SG neurons has been described for
decades, with cells showing distinct connection pattern and firing
properties5,8,9,24,33,34,51. So far however, the cellular and mole-
cular mechanisms proposed to underlie these differences involved
variation in ribbon size at the IHC-afferent synapse, pre-synaptic
specialization at the IHC active zone or the patterns of lateral
efferents innervating the post-synaptic bouton of auditory affer-
ents34,52,53. Although these mechanisms could exert significant
roles on the sensitivity differences among auditory afferents, our
data demonstrate the existence of three genetically distinct sub-
classes of type I neurons that could reflect specific coding of the
vast range of intensity levels the auditory system processes5. Their
molecular profile, connection and electrophysiological patterns
strongly suggest that the Ia and Ic populations represent the LT
auditory afferents while the Ib type, the HT afferents. Several
observations support this hypothesis. First, peripheral projections
of Ib and of both the Ia and Ic afferents travel separately to
innervate the modiolar and the pillar sides of IHCs, respectively, a
segregation previously associated with the different threshold
sensitivities of the auditory afferents1,2,8,33,34. Second, the Ib
neurons display a wide range of accommodation and spiking
rates, which has been previously described and could provide a
cellular substrate to encoding various stimulus intensities24.
Third, Kcnc2 (Kv3.2), whose expression and function characterize
neurons capable of sustained or repetitive firing23,30, is uniquely
and variably expressed in the Ib population and might thus

 contribute to the molecular setting that controls the various firing
patterns of Ib neurons. Finally, the proportion of Ib neurons
increases in the cochlea of the rat (Supplementary Fig. 11) which,
as the cat and macaque monkey, shows finer sensitivity in
detecting intensity changes compared to mouse54. This could
suggest that the more HT SG neurons, the finer sensitivity to
intensity changes. Together, our results are thus consistent with
the general idea of distinct specialized populations of SG neurons
that would provide a neuronal substrate to process sound
intensity information5,8,33,34,51. Moreover, they suggest that,
similarly to what has been shown in the visual system55, within a
particular neuronal population (i.e., Ib neurons), the continuum
of variable biophysical properties of neurons could in fact be
genetically determined so that specific groups of few neurons
would be tuned to a particular range of intensities. This also
supports future work aimed at validating in vivo the physiological
role of Ib neurons in sound intensity coding and at resolving
whether the Ia and Ic populations represent two functionally
distinct populations or reflect certain local environment.
Overt hearing loss and self-perceived hearing handicap, which
includes speech-in-noise recognition disabilities, tinnitus, and
hyperacusis are often associated with degeneration or dysfunction
of auditory afferents. Moreover, recent work showed that HT SG
neurons are more vulnerable to loud sound56,57, and suggested
that a progressive HT neuropathy might represent an important
contributor to the hearing handicap observed with ageing58,
highlighting a selective vulnerability of HT SG neurons. Our
comprehensive transcriptomic characterization of the four types
of SG neurons will thus facilitate comparative analysis of
homologous cell types with other species, but also linking gene
expression to cellular function and auditory perception as well as
their alteration with hearing disorders. In this context, future
studies will be needed to also identify the dedicated output
neurons and associated ascending circuits needed to process
centrally the peripheral information encoded by each individual
SG neuron type.
Methods
Mouse strains. Wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used unless specified otherwise.
Rosa26TOM (Ai14, Stock No: 007914, C57Bl/6 background), PVCre (Stock No:
017320, C57Bl/6 background), mice were ordered from The Jackson Laboratory.
EphA4GFP (Stock No: 011107-UCD, mixed Swiss Webster and C57bl/6 back-
ground) was ordered from MMRRC. Brn3aCreERT2 (mixed 129Sv and C57BL/6
background, from CCTEC, Cornell) mice was described elsewhere59. Animals were
group-housed, with food and water ad libitum, under 12-h light–dark cycle con-
ditions. All animal work was performed in accordance with the national guidelines
and approved by the local ethics committee of Stockholm, Stockholms Norra
djurförsöksetiska nämnd. Animals were killed when reaching a score of 0.3 on
Karolinska Institute’s extended health assessment list. Animals used for this study
were of either sex for postnatal experiments, and males from P17 onwards.
Tamoxifen-induced sparse labeling. Tamoxifen induction of Brn3aCreERT2;
Rosa26tdTOM mice was performed by single intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg per
25 g.bw into P21 mice. Mice were harvested at P30, and efficiency of recombination
was analyzed using immunostaining for RFP and calretinin (Ia and Ic neurons) and
in situ hybridization for Lypd1 (Ib neurons) on spiral ganglion sections. The degree
of recombination in spiral ganglion neurons was very low and variable between
animals and litters. Only animals showing a recombination efficiency of about 25%
within the Ib population of cochlear neurons were considered for analysis. In these
animals, ~94% of RFP+ recombined type I neurons were Ib neurons, confirming
the specificity of our sparse labeling strategy for the Ib afferents.
Single-cell isolation. Spiral ganglia were dissected and collected in Leibovit’z L-15
medium (Life technologies) on ice. Then the spiral ganglia (SG) were incubated in
papain–DNAse solution (1.5 ml of papain at 1 mg ml−1, 0.5 ml of DNAse at 0.1%)
for 35 min (for P3 samples) or 25 min (for Adult samples) at 37 °C, shaking at 700
RPM. After spinning down the samples at 400 RCF for 10 min, the supernatant was
removed and replaced by Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) F-12 (Life
technologies). SG were physically triturated using three different sizes of pipettes
previously coated with 0.2% bovine serum albumin until the solution
homogenized. The cell suspension was then filtered through 70 μm cell strainer
(BD Biosciences) to remove clusters of cells.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Single Tomato or GFP positive cells were
sorted by FAC sorting into individual wells of 384-well plates containing lysis
buffer. Plates containing single cells were frozen immediately on dry ice and stored
at −80 °C. We used six animals (12 cochleae) per experiment.
Cell culture. After centrifugation of the single cells, pellets were reconstituted in 1
ml of culture media [Neurobasal-A, supplemented with 2% B27 (v/v), L-glutamine
0.5 mM, penicillin 100 U ml−1; Invitrogen] complemented with 10 ng µl−1 of
BDNF and NT3 (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10% of fetal bovine serum. Cells were plated
on square glass coverslips previously coated with poly-D-lysine and laminin
(Nordic Biosite). SG neurons were cultured for 48 h to allow the detachment of
Schwann cells from neuronal cells and the culture media were changed every 24 h.
Single-cell RNA sequencing. Smart-Seq2 protocol was performed on single isolated
cells by Eukaryotic Single Cell Genomics Facility at SciLifeLab, Stockholm. The
protocol was described previously60,61. A total of 487 adult SG neurons were isolated
from PVcre,R26TOM mice and for P3 stage, a total of 478 SG neurons were isolated:
359 from PVcre,R26TOM mice (P3, sample A), and 119 SG neurons, from EphA4GFP
mice (where GFP expression is labelling all SG neuron types without distinction at P3,
see Supplementary Fig. 7) (P3, sample B). RNAseq data from sample A and B were
indistinguishable and were therefore merged to increase the sample size.
Electrophysiological recordings. Recordings were made from neuronal somata at
room temperature. Neurons were obtained from P21 to P25 PVCre;R26TOM mice.
The bath solution was composed of (in mM): 125 NaCl, 25 glucose, 25 NaHCO3,
2.5 KCl, 2 CaCl2, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 1 MgCl2 and saturated with 95% oxygen and 5%
CO2. Cells were visualized using IR-DIC microscope (Olympus, TYO, Japan) and
digital camera. Tomato-expressing PV+ cells were identified by switching from
infrared to epi-fluorescence mode using a LED source and LED control module
(Mightex BioLED, CA, USA). Patch pipettes with resistances of 6–10 MΩ were
pulled with Flamming/Brown micropipette puller P-1000 (Sutter Instruments Co,
Novato, CA) and filled with intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 K-
gluconate, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 Na2-Phosphocreatine, 4 ATP-Mg, 0.3 GTP-Na and
with pH adjusted with KOH to 7.3 and osmolarity: 288 mOsm l−1. Liquid junction
potential was not corrected for. Recordings were performed with pipette capaci-
tance and access resistance compensated throughout the experiment. Acceptable
current-clamp recordings had to meet the following criteria: low noise level, stable
membrane potential, and overshooting APs (magnitudes of ≥60 mV from baseline)
and access resistance below 20 MΩ. If any of these parameters changed during an
experiment, the remaining data were not further analyzed. Recordings were
amplified using multiclamp 700B amplifiers (Molecular Devices, CA, USA), filtered
at 2 KHz, digitized (10–20 KHz) using ITC-18 (HEKA Elektronik, Instrutech, NY,
USA), and acquired and analyzed with Igor Pro (Wavemetrics, OR, USA). Remote
control SM7 system (Luigs Neumann, Germany) was used to control manipulator,
read, and save XYZ coordinates of recorder cells in the dish for later identification.
Stimulation protocols. >The intrinsic electrical properties were determined by a
series of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing somatic current injection protocols,
during whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, designed to capture their key active and
passive electrical properties. All recordings were carried out in current-clamp mode
and because dependency of the accommodation rate on the holding membrane
potential was not observed at this post hearing stage, all cells were recorded at −70
mV. Several parameters were obtained from recorded cells: resting membrane
potential was measured at the onset of whole-cell recording. IV (the
current–voltage relationship) was extracted by a series of subthreshold current
injections with addition scaling factor multiplying steps accordingly to resistance
and rheobase to obtain optimal resolution for each cell. Input resistance for steady
state was calculated as the slope of the regression line fit to steady-state membrane
potential responses to −5 pA current injection from rest. Voltage threshold for
evoking action potential (AP) was measured as the value of the membrane
potential at which its first derivative (dV/dt) crossed 10 mV s−1 in response to step
depolarization from resting potential and rheobase was the minimal depolarizing
current to reach threshold and elicit an action potential. Membrane time constant
was determined by fitting the decay phases of hyperpolarizing pulses to an expo-
nential function. AP max: maximal number of AP elicited in response to 200 ms
lasting suprathreshold step current reaching three times stronger current than
rheobase. Inter-spike interval (ISI): measured as the difference in time between the
onsets of the first two APs. Parameters assessed included also action potential
waveform AP duration: average time for the first AP from onset to the same voltage
during offset. AP onset: defined as the time near the voltage inflection when the
voltage changes more than 0.5 mV within 50 µs. AP latency: time from the
threshold to peak of the AP. AP duration half-width: average time for the first AP
from half amplitude to the same voltage during offset. Sag, the response to a
hyperpolarizing current step: was measured as the difference between exponentially
extrapolated voltage and steady-state voltage and analyzed to reveal the existence of
hyperpolarization-dependent inward currents. Slow after-hyperpolarisation (s-

Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. All data are from P21 mice,
unless specified. Cochleae were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, O/N (for in situ
hybridization) or 2 h (for immunohistochemistry) at 4 °C. After fixation, cochleae
older than P10 were incubated in decalcification cocktail (fresh 5% EDTA, 0.4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS) O/N at 4 °C. Cochleae were then incubated in 30%
sucrose O/N at 4 °C. Finally, half of the sucrose solution was replaced by optimal
cutting temperature (OCT) compound for ON, rolling at 4 °C. Specimens were
then mounted in OCT and sectioned at 14 µm. RNA in situ hybridization
experiments were performed using RNAscope®, an RNA in situ hybridization
technique described previously62. Paired double-Z oligonucleotide probes were
designed against target RNA using custom software. The RNAscope® Reagent Kit
(Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, CA) was used according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (kit version 1). Frozen fixed tissue sections were prepared
according to manufacturer’s recommendations. Each sample was quality controlled
for RNA integrity with a probe specific to the housekeeping gene Ppib. Negative
control background staining was evaluated using a probe specific to the bacterial
DapB gene. The probes used in this study are summarized in Supplementary
Table 2. For immunohistochemistry, sections were permeabilized, blocked and
incubated O/N at 4 °C with 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% normal donkey serum (Fischer
Scientific) and the appropriate concentration of primary antibodies in PBS, fol-
lowed by three rinses in PBS and labeling with AlexaFluor-conjugated secondary
antibodies (1:500, Invitrogen) in 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% normal donkey serum in
PBS for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were then washed three times in PBS
and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (Dako). For Runx1 staining,
cryostat sections were permeabilized with 1.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h, followed by
three washes with PBS and incubated with primary antibody in 0.3% Triton X-100/
3% normal serum in PBS for 72 h at 4 °C, three washes in PBS and incubated with
primary antibody in 0.3% Triton X-100/3% normal serum in PBS for 3 h at room
temperature and then overnight at 4 °C.
Quantification of the neuronal fibers. Whole mount cochlea were stained by
using calretinin (CR) to target Ia/c fibers and parvalbumin (PV) for all type I fibers
underneath the IHCs. For each cochlea, three areas with seven IHCs per area from
mid-basal levels were imaged (Z-stacks through the organ of Corti) and analyzed.
The organ of Corti was 3D reconstructed, and the baso-apical orientation of the
IHCs was assessed by using the stereocilia of the apical region of the IHCs as
landmarks. The IHC side facing the OHCs was considered as the pillar side, and
the IHC side facing the SG neurons, the modiolar side. Each Z-stack section was
analyzed using ImageJ, first by defining the area of interest (below the IHCs).
Automated selection of the immunostained area for either PV or CR positive fibers
was done using “analyze particle” in ImageJ and measured.
All sections were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope.
Antibodies used, together with their concentration, source and catalog number are
summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
Statistical analysis of imaging data. Statistical analysis was performed using
GraphPad Prism. For neuronal counting and soma area quantifications in cochlea
sections, we used ImageJ software. ABout 6–8 randomly selected sections per
animal (for basal, medial and apical region) from at least three different animals
were used for quantification. The results are shown as mean ± SEM. as indicated in
figure legends. The statistical test performed is reported in the figure legend. t-tests
were two-sided. Legend for significance: *P ≤ 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001. No
animals or data points were excluded from the analyses. No statistical methods
were used to pre-determine sample size but our sample size are similar to those
generally employed in the field. Randomization was used whenever possible.
Single-cell RNAseq data analysis. P3 and adult data were analyzed with the same
pipeline, though with minor differences in the parameter settings. Here we describe
the analysis of adult data specifically. The raw data of single-cell RNA sequencing
were processed with standard pipeline by Eukaryotic Single Cell Genomics Facility at
SciLifeLab, Stockholm. Most of the downstream analysis was done using R software
package Seurat v2.0 (https://github.com/satijalab/seurat; http://satijalab.org/seurat/).
Considering the distribution of genes identified in every cell, we selected cells
with at least 5000 (P17 and P21 data) or 6000 (P33 data) unique genes detected for
downstream analysis. This step removed empty wells and low-quality cells, leaving
316, 137, 34 cells for P17, P21, and P33 data, respectively. Genes expressed in less
than three cells were also removed from analysis. To be able to integrate different
data sets, we used a global normalization strategy incorporated in SEURAT
package to make the data comparable between different cells and between different
SMART-seq2 runs. The gene expression measurements within each cell were scaled
by a constant factor 10,000, then natural-log transformed. This generated a new
gene expression matrix yi;j¼ logð
xi;j
Zj � 10; 000Þ, where xi,j is the count of gene i in
cell j and Zi,j is the total counts of all genes in cell j.
We calculated the dispersion (ratio of variation to mean) of genes and selected
those highly variable genes from each data set. The variable genes were used for
alignment of different data sets. We also regressed out the cell–cell variation in
gene expression driven by “percent.mito (the percentage of mitochondrial gene
content)” using ScaleData function.
To reveal the shared sources of biological variation in order to identify common
subpopulations across different stages, we used the integration tool for single-cell
RNAseq data sets provided by Seurat package version2.0. This tool has shown better
performance over other benchmarking alignment and batch correction tools, e.g.,
limma, ComBat63. It comprises Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) which is a
method of inferring relationship from two matrices. Given two groups of cells X =
(X1, X2,…, Xm) and Y = (Y1, Y2,…, Yn), and if there were correlations among them,
the analysis would determine a set of canonical variates (CVs, referred to as CCs in
Seurat package), storing linear combinations of Xi and Yj which have maximal
correlation with each other. Then CCs could be used for downstream analysis,
including t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) and subtype
clustering. We started with aligning P17 and P21 data together. Using a union of most
variable genes from both data sets as the input for CCA, we selected the first ten CCs
to approximate all CCs which project both data sets into the maximally correlated
subspace. Then we added P33 data into the union of P17 and P21 data, repeated the
CCA and selected the first nine CCs to align the CCA subspaces. As such, all cells
from different stages were integrated together.
In order to obtain an overview of heterogeneity in the integrated adult data, we
ran function RunTSNE using the first 9 CCs to visualize cells in the two-
dimensional space and used function FindClusters (resolution = 1) to identify
clusters of cells.
To identify differentially expressed genes in each cluster, we used likelihood-
ratio test64 implemented in function FindMarkers. The parameters “min.pct = 0.1”
and “thresh.use = 0.1” are chosen to select genes expressed in more than 10% of
cells and with average expression level over 0.1 (normalized data) in the given
cluster. The genes were ranked by P-value from low to high, with lower P-value
indicating more differentially expressed genes.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis visualized by network. Top 500 of type I SG
neurons or type II SG neurons specific genes were used as input for GSEA using
Cytoscape65 and its plugin Bingo66. The most up-to-date gene ontology file “go-basic.
obo” and gene association file “gene_association.mgi” were downloaded directly from
Gene Ontology Consortium website instead of using Bingo’s default ontologies or
associations. The following evidence codes were discarded from analysis: IEA
(inferred from electronic annotation), ISS (inferred from sequence similarity).
Significant GO terms (P-value < 0.05, corrected using Benjamini & Hochberg
False Discovery Rate (FDR) correction) were used as input for Cytoscape’s plugin
EnrichmentMap to generate a network where mutually overlapping gene sets
cluster together. Following parameters were used: P-value cutoff 0.001, FDR Q-
value cutoff 0.05, similarity cutoff with Jaccard coefficient 0.25.
Genes which were differentially expressed in at least one but not all SG neuron
types were pooled together (Supplementary files). We retrieved the genes annotated
with specific GO terms (Supplementary Table 3) and showed expression of them in
different SG neuron types by heat map.
Comparison between P3 and adult. The average gene expression of SG neuron
types at P3 and adult were used to compute Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
Differentially expressed genes between P3 and adult were identified using Wil-
coxon rank sum test. P-value and log fold change of genes were used to compute
the volcano plots. We have compared the volcano plots obtained using the P-values
with those using the multiplicity adjusted P-values and found no difference in the
results (genes differentially expressed between P3 and adult in the
neurotransmission-related category of genes). The P-value for all volcano plots are
shown in the Fig. 6 to keep the consistency between all neuronal subclasses, since
the type II subclass has only seven cells in our data set, and multiplicity adjusted P-
values cannot be applied for this group.
