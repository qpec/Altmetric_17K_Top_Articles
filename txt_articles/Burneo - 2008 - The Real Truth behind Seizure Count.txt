OBJECTIVE:
Despite side effects associated with the use of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), withdrawal of AEDs remains controversial, even after
prolonged seizure freedom. The main objective of this study was to assess the effects of AED withdrawal on cognitive functions, seizure
relapse, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and EEG results. Additionally, potential predictors for freedom from seizures after AED
withdrawal were studied. METHODS: Patients, seizure-free for more than 2 years on AED monotherapy, were recruited for a controlled,
prospective, randomized, double-blinded withdrawal study lasting for 12 months, or until seizure relapse. Patients were randomized
to AED withdrawal (n = 79) and nonwithdrawal (n = 81) groups. The examination program included clinical neurological examinations,
neuropsychological testing, EEG-recordings, cerebral MRI, and assessments of HRQOL. Follow-up data on seizure relapse were also
collected beyond the 12-month study period (median 47 months). RESULTS: Seizure relapse at 12 months occurred in 15% of the
withdrawal group and 7% of the nonwithdrawal group (RR 2.46; 95% CI: 0.85–7.08; p = 0.095). After withdrawal, seizure relapse
rates were 27% after a median of 41 months off medication. A normal result to all 15 neuropsychological tests increased significantly
from 11% to 28% postwithdrawal. We found no significant effects of withdrawal on quality of life and EEG. Predictors for remaining
seizure-free after AED-withdrawal over 1 year were normal neurological examination and use of carbamazepine prior to withdrawal.
CONCLUSION: Seizure-free epilepsy patients on AED monotherapy who taper their medication may improve neuropsychological
performance with a relative risk of seizure relapse of 2.46, compared to those continuing therapy.
COMMENTARY
A
pproximately
two-thirds
of
patients
with
new-
onset epilepsy become seizure-free when treated with
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) (1). In a portion of these patients
who maintain prolonged remission, it is possible to withdraw
AED therapy. The study by Lossius et al. adds additional infor-
mation to help clinicians inform patients of the risks and bene-
fits, when trying to make the decision as to whether to withdraw
AEDs. Even when prior studies have been prospective and ran-
domized, they have been open label. Lossius et al. conducted a
well-controlled prospective, randomized, double-blind investi-
gation assessing not only the effects of AED withdrawal on the
risk of seizure relapse but also on possible changes in cognitive
functions.
A critical review of 28 studies encompassing 4,571 patients
noted that the risk of seizure relapsed after AED withdrawal
ranged from 4 to 34% at 1 year and 9 to 39% at 2 years (2).
The findings of Lossius et al. are similar to the largest single
study of AED withdrawal, which was conducted by the Med-
ical Research Council (MRC) from 1984 to 1988 (3). Lossius
and colleagues found that the risk of seizure relapse in patients
who withdrew AEDs was about double the risk of patients who
continued AEDs at the end of 1 year (i.e., 15% vs 7% at the end
of the double-blind period). In comparison, the MRC study,
which included 1,031 patients, found that the risk of seizure
recurrence was doubled at the end of 2 years (i.e., 41% vs 22%)
(3). Since patients who were not in the AED withdrawal group
in the first year of the Lossius et al. study were offered with-
drawal after the 1 year double-blind period, data on recurrence
with continued AED therapy are not available from their report
after the first year; however, the AED withdrawal group can be
compared to the MRC study. In fact, seizure recurrence at the
end of 2 years in the AED withdrawal groups is remarkably
similar (i.e., 19% in the present study vs 22% in MRC study).
Further, a meta-analysis published in 1994 found that the risk of
seizure relapse after AED withdrawal was 29 percent at 2 years
(95% confidence intervals [CI], 24%, 34%) (4). In both stud-
ies and both reviews cited above, the large majority of seizure
relapses occurred in the first 12 months, with the risk of seizure
relapse thereafter being very similar, especially after 2 years, for
the withdrawal and continued AED treatment groups.
Various factors may affect the risk of seizure relapse, al-
though there is some controversy as to the importance of specific
issues.Averagerisksmaynotberelevanttoanindividualpatient,
as epilepsy is a heterogeneous disorder (5). Thus, some patients
will require AEDs for continued control of seizures, whereas
prolonged AED treatment for others may be unnecessary.
For example, up to 90% of patients with juvenile myoclonic
epilepsy will relapse if AEDs are withdrawn, but children with

benign rolandic epilepsy usually remit permanently. A multi-
variate analysis of the MRC study found that the risk of seizures
with AED withdrawal increased with specific factors including:
age >16 years, seizures only on awakening, myoclonic seizures,
more than one AED, seizures after the start of AED therapy,
and shorter seizure-free periods on AEDs (5). Other factors that
have been found to increase the risk of seizure relapse include
syndrome (e.g., juvenile myoclonic epilepsy), mental retarda-
tion, and abnormal neurological exam (2). Lossius et al. found
that risk was reduced in patients with a normal neurological
exam and in those withdrawing from carbamazepine. Interest-
ingly, a similar finding for carbamazepine was seen in the MRC
study, although the reason for the finding remains obscure (6).
The lack of AED dose and blood level data in these studies
may create variance in the results. Investigations have yielded
mixed results on the risks related to age of onset and to dura-
tion of epilepsy. The role of EEG also has been inconclusive;
however, many studies have lumped abnormal EEG findings,
so distinct factors cannot be identified. One might expect that
well-formed spike wave complexes, especially occurring in runs,
would suggest a higher risk than poorly formed sharps or slow-
ing. Unfortunately, EEG in the present study was only assessed
for change and was not included in the analysis of possible pre-
dictors of seizure relapse. Hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis
on MRI have been shown to increase the risk of relapse (7),
but other types of MRI abnormalities have not been adequately
studied. In addition, the certainty of the original diagnosis is
another factor that might impact the risk of seizure relapse. Los-
sius et al. found that the presence of an MRI abnormality did
not predict seizure relapse, but they did not analyze types of
MRI abnormalities separately.
How long should a patient be seizure free before consider-
ing AED withdrawal? A Cochrane review concluded that there
is evidence to support waiting ≥2 years with children; how-
ever, the optimal time period remains uncertain in adults (8).
Note that most adult studies have been conducted in patients
who are ≥2 years seizure free. The MRC study did find that
a shorter duration of the seizure-free period increased risk of
seizure relapse after AED withdrawal (3).
Does the rate at which the AED is tapered affect risk of
relapse? A recent Cochrane review did not come to any reliable
conclusion on the optimal taper rate (9). Of course, some AEDs
(e.g., phenobarbital) require slow taper to avoid withdrawal
seizures. Further, many physicians choose to taper slowly, based
on the concept that if relapse occurs during the taper, the seizure
may be less severe than after full withdrawal.
The risks associated with AED withdrawal (e.g., injury or
loss of driving privileges) need to be balanced against the risks
and cost of long-term AED therapy. Risks associate with long-
term AED use include cognitive and behavioral side effects, os-
teopenia/osteoporosis, connective tissue abnormalities, weight
gain, drug interactions (e.g., altered effectiveness of other drugs
affected by AEDs), anatomical and behavioral teratogenesis in
the children of women with epilepsy, and other untoward side
effects. The study by Lossius et al. investigation found that
AED withdrawal resulted in a modest improvement in cogni-
tive functions. The magnitude of the cognitive effect was similar
to prior studies (10) that examined the older AEDs employed
in the Lossius et al. study. Although modest, these effects can
be clinically significant (10). Given that several of the newer
AEDs possess fewer cognitive effects (10), the benefit may not
exist on withdrawal.
The decision to withdraw an AED in a patient who is
seizure-free is ultimately one that has to be individualized
and undertaken with the patient fully informed of the risks
and benefits. The decision needs to take into account the
known risk factors, the possible benefits of withdrawal, the
certainty/uncertainty of our present data, and the individual
patient’s psychosocial factors. Additional blinded, randomized,
controlled trials are needed to identify the optimal timing of
AED withdrawal, further delineate the risk factors, and deter-
mine the risk/benefit ratios for the newer AEDs.

THE REAL TRUTH BEHIND SEIZURE COUNT
Epilepsy: Accuracy of Patient Seizure Counts. Hoppe C, Poepel A, Elger CE. Arch Neurol 2007;64(11):1595–1599.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a daily patient reminder on seizure documentation accuracy. DESIGN: Randomized controlled
trial. SETTING: Monitoring unit of an academic department of epileptology. PATIENTS: Consecutive sample of 91 adult inpatients with
focal epilepsies undergoing video-electroencephalographic monitoring. INTERVENTION: While all patients were asked to document
seizures at the beginning of the monitoring period, patients from the experimental group were reminded each day to document
seizures. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Documentation accuracy (percentage of documented seizures). RESULTS: A total of 582
partial seizures were recorded. Patients failed to document 55.5% of all recorded seizures, 73.2% of complex partial seizures, 26.2%
of simple partial seizures, 41.7% of secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 85.8% of all seizures during sleeping, and 32.0%
of all seizures during the awake state. The group medians of individual documentation accuracies for overall seizures, simple partial
seizures, complex partial seizures, and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures were 33.3%, 66.7%, 0%, and 83.3%, respectively.
Neither the patient reminder nor cognitive performance affected documentation accuracy. A left-sided electroencephalographic focus
or lesion, but not the site (frontal or temporal), contributed to documentation failure. CONCLUSIONS: Patient seizure counts do not
provide valid information. Documentation failures result from postictal seizure unawareness, which cannot be avoided by reminders.
Unchanged documentation accuracy is a prerequisite for the use of patient seizure counts in clinical trials and has to be demonstrated
in a subsample of patients undergoing electroencephalographic monitoring.
COMMENTARY
T
rusting patients’ count of seizures is a practice in which
many clinicians engage, and sometimes it is the only way
antiepileptic regimens are planned for a particular individual.
Review of calendars, notebooks, agendas, and all sorts of vi-
sual aids for that purpose are part of a routine visit to the
epilepsy clinic. But, the implications go beyond this clinical
practice, because large-scale clinical trials (including those test-
ing for new antiepileptic medications), population-based ques-
tionnaires, and other epidemiological studies also use patient
feedback and reporting to determine optimal therapy regimens.
The article by Hoppe et al. confirms, although with a larger pa-
tient population, what has been described before: a great num-
ber of patients underreport the occurrence of seizures (1,2).
Although, this study was restricted to adult patients with partial
seizures, underreporting also was seen in secondarily general-
ized seizures. What is unknown from the report by Hoppe and
colleagues is whether underreporting also occurs with primarily
generalized seizures. Their study indicates that underreporting
does not take place because patients lack reminders to count
seizures—in fact, their embedded, randomized, controlled trial
show no improvement with reminders. Rather, their investiga-
tion revealed that underreporting was related to the patient’s
lack of awareness of the event.
Lack of awareness of a seizure was seen mainly in patients
with an epileptogenic focus on the left hemisphere, which can
be used as a localizing sign, particularly for temporal lobe onset
(2,3). Their finding confirms previous information indicating
that “consciousness can be disturbed much easier by the ic-
tal activity in left temporal seizures” (4). Thus, the dominant
hemisphere may be important in generating a state of alert-
ness. Patients with left hemispheric seizures, particularly of left
temporal lobe origin, experienced a significantly longer state
of postictal confusion, which is something that cannot be ex-
plained by postictal aphasia alone. The question of whether
patients forget their seizures or fail to recognize them is yet to
be answered (5).
A technique that may allow greater accuracy in seizure
counting is ambulatory EEG (6). This device is superior to the
standard, sleep-deprived, 20 to 30 minute EEG recording for
capturing seizures (7), although no comparative studies with
prolonged video-EEG have been performed. Even though it
is an expensive tool, inpatient seizure monitoring offers the
advantage of video recording events and close surveillance of
the technical quality of the EEG recording. Yet, the poten-
tial advantages of long-term ambulatory recordings in the pa-
tients’ familiar environments are compelling as well. Many spe-
cific clinical questions, such as frequency of absence seizures
or occurrence of unwitnessed nocturnal seizures, may be most
easily answered with ambulatory EEG. Video capabilities can
be adapted and incorporated into ambulatory EEG; in this
way, the limitation of visual clinical correlation of electro-
graphic and patient-identified events can be eliminated. Still,
rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis should be applied to am-
bulatory EEG using adequate methodology and high-quality
clinical data.
An interesting finding from the Hoppe et al. study is the
possible interaction between seizure awareness and the specific

antiepileptic medication used. In particular, patients on lev-
etiracetam had better documentation accuracy than those on
other medications—a finding that could be due to a sampling
problem; however, changes in the semiology of seizures after
the introduction of a new antiepileptic medication are some-
times seen in the outpatient setting as well. For some drugs, the
changes are positive, particularly if the new semiology incor-
porates an aura not previously perceived prior to a seizure. In
contrast, the disappearance of an aura may endanger somebody
who previously had used them as a warning. The mechanisms
underlying differences in documentation accuracy on various
medications are not clear; larger studies, including a larger sam-
ple of patients each on a different antiepileptic medication, are
needed.
Finally, it is important to take into account that this study
was performed in an artificial environment. It is true that pa-
tients are unaware of most of their seizures, but there are always
clues that a seizure just happened: a crowd of people suddenly
showing up, friends or family members caring for the patient,
paramedics arriving or taking the person to the hospital, among
others. Furthermore, in the Hoppe et al. study, the majority
of seizures not reported by patients happened during sleep—a
time during which ambulatory EEG may be useful. However,
in regard to daytime seizures, the question asked by clinicians
should continue to be: “How many seizures have you had since
the last time I saw you?”

PURPOSE: Exacerbation of epilepsy may occur following initiation of therapy with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). The aim of this
study is to analyze the clinical and EEG characteristics of a group of pediatric patients with worsening of seizures and/or EEG deteri-
oration while on oxcarbazepine (OXC). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a clinical database was performed to identify patients
with epilepsy treated with OXC over the past 3 years. History, neurological examination, and EEG findings were reviewed to identify
any who had developed exacerbation of seizures or new abnormalities on EEG. RESULTS: Of 290 patients on OXC, we identified
12 patients with new onset seizures, all with initial normal neurological exam and normal EEG, who developed either worsening of
preexisting seizures, new seizure types, and/or EEG deterioration following introduction of OXC monotherapy. EEG changes were
primarily characterized by new onset of generalized epileptiform activity not reported on the initial baseline EEG. Following substitution
of OXC with a broad spectrum AED, significant improvement of seizure control and improvement in the EEG was observed. CONCLU-
SIONS: These findings suggest that OXC can aggravate seizures and/or worsen EEG features in children. Following initiation of therapy
with OXC, monitoring of patients with follow-up EEGs may be important, especially in patients who do not show adequate response
to therapy.

new seizure types in children ages 4 to 16 years. The most
frequent transformation on the EEG in this case series was
the appearance of generalized spike and slow wave complexes.
Oxcarbazepine is a keto-analog to carbamazepine; therefore, it
is not surprising that oxcarbazepine, like carbamazepine, can
elicit new seizure types. In carbamazepine case studies, new
seizure types have been reported especially in children with
partial onset seizures or in seizures that at least initially appear to
be partial onset (1). An important point of interest to clinicians
is that the Verdrame et al. study investigates oxcarbazepine—
the only drug that currently has a Level A classification from
the International League Against Epilepsy Guidelines for use in
children with partial onset seizures (2,3). These findings now
may make the Guideline recommendations questionable. Yet,
the frequency of seizure aggravation in this population was only
12 of 290 patients or 4.14 percent. Among the carbamazepine
population in similar studies, seizure aggravation is found in up
to 44 percent of patients <6 years of age (1).
The weakness of the Verdrame et al. study is that it is retro-
spective, and therefore the population studied cannot be reliably
controlled for all factors. Still, it is a large study, and the patient
histories seem to be well documented. Any patient complain-
ing of worsening of seizures or having behavioral changes were
reassessed by EEG. If EEG deterioration was seen, the patient
was taken off oxcarbazepine and given another drug, most often
valproate. The authors assert that the children’s parents all kept
seizure calendars as well as records of behavioral changes and
school performance. If this assertion is correct, then this retro-
spective analysis could actually be of value for determining the
riskofseizureexacerbationwithoxcarbazepine,althoughseizure
type or syndrome is never as well defined as in prospective trial.
When a pattern of adverse events is detected outside of clinical
trials, reports are almost always retrospective. Idiosyncratic side
effects are frequently identified in postmarketing studies, as was
the case with visual field deficits associated with vigabatrin (4).
Therefore, retrospective studies reporting seizure aggravation
are an important and valid initial step in determining novel
adverse events.
The authors speculate on possible reasons for the seizure
aggravation, pointing to the proposed mechanism of action
of oxcarbazepine as a sodium-channel blocker and how that
mechanism might elicit different seizure types. A recent report
by Liu et al. concerning carbamazepine points to the possibility
that seizure aggravation of carbamazepine, especially in absence
seizures, could be caused by stimulation of a subtype of GABAA
receptors in the ventrobasal nucleus of the thalamus (5). Liu
and colleagues studied the effect of carbamazepine on GABAA
stimulation by eliciting absence seizures in the GAERS rat
model. Since, as mentioned, oxcarbazepine is a keto-analogue
of carbamazepine, this interesting new mechanism may well
apply to oxcarbazepine as well.
Seizure aggravation is a problem encountered mainly
in GABAergic (e.g., tiagabine, gabapentin, and vigabatrin)
and sodium channel blocking drugs (e.g., phenytoin, carba-
mazepine, and lamotrigine), although anecdotal reports of
seizure provocation have been cited for almost all antiepilep-
tic drugs (AEDs) (6). Particularly in patients with idiopathic
epilepsies, seizure aggravation is not an uncommon problem,
while adult patients with partial onset seizures seem to be more
immune to this effect (7). However, children are different in
this regard because they have a higher incidence of idiopathic
epilepsy syndromes than adults and should be followed with
greater care to avoid seizure aggravation, as it may occur when
least expected (8).
How can the clinician be sure whether the drug used by
a specific patient has elicited a new seizure type or instead has
caused an increase in seizures or EEG change? It is possible that
a change of seizure type or an increase of seizures could happen
anyway—thus, the only way to explicitly demonstrate a corre-
lation is to retest the patient after the drug is first withdrawn
and the situation normalized. A retest is, however, not ethically
possible so physicians have to rely on evidence of a temporal
relationship between the drug use and the appearance of new
seizure types.
What are the implications of these findings? It is important
for all neurologists to be aware that patients, especially children,
can develop a new seizure type or new cognitive and behavioral
changes after administration of an untried AED. Changes in
these variables might be due to the new AED or to a pharma-
codynamic interaction with other AEDs. It is valuable when
doctors vigilantly report occurrences in seizure aggravation to
health authorities like the Food and Drug Administration and
MedWatch in the United States, as patterns of adverse effects
can then be detected.

SEIZURE REMISSION IN ADULTS WITH INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY: NOT JUST
A PIPE DREAM
Likelihood of Seizure Remission in an Adult Population with Refractory Epilepsy. Callaghan BC, Anand K, Hesdorffer
D, Hauser WA, French JA. Ann Neurol 2007;62(4):382–389.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the likelihood of remission
and its clinical predictors in adult patients meeting a strict definition of refractory epilepsy. We also wanted to investigate the influence
of treatment regimen on remission. METHODS: A total of 246 patients with treatment refractory epilepsy (having at least 1 seizure per
month and having not responded positively to at least 2 antiepileptic drugs) were identified in 2000 and followed for 3 years. We used
Kaplan-Meier methods to estimate the rate of achieving a 6-month terminal seizure remission and Cox regression analysis to evaluate
clinical predictors for seizure remission. RESULTS: The estimated 6-month terminal seizure remission rate was 19% (95% confidence
interval, 14–26%) for all cases and 14% (95% confidence interval, 10–21%) when limited to those treated only with medication.
Negative predictors for remission included a history of status epilepticus, younger age at intractability, number of failed drug therapies,
and presence of mental retardation. No specific drug was significantly associated with remission, and frequently, no clear intervention
led to terminal remission. INTERPRETATION: Fifteen percent (approximately 5% per year) of a drug refractory epilepsy population
obtained a 6-month terminal seizure remission. Our results signify that no matter how many antiepileptic drug therapies have failed,
there is always hope of a meaningful seizure remission in this population. Furthermore, we have elucidated four clinical predictors that
can aid the epileptologist in prognostication.
COMMENTARY
A
lthough an abundance of new anticonvulsants have been
developed over the past decade, roughly a third of people
with epilepsy still have medically intractable seizures (1). Poorly
controlled seizures are associated with increased mortality and
significant physical and psychosocial morbidity (2). While in-
dividuals occasionally demonstrate an exceptional response to
the addition of one of the newer medications, there is little evi-
dence that these agents have had a significant impact on seizure
control for newly diagnosed patients (1) or patients who have
not responded to other medications (3). In 2000, Kwan and
Brodie reported that medical intractability often may be pre-
dicted early in treatment. In their study of newly diagnosed
epilepsy, patients failing to respond to the first medication only
had an 11 percent chance of responding to a second medication
(1). Thus, clinicians have inferred that aggressive medication
changes are likely to be futile in patients who have continued
to have seizures despite several anticonvulsant trials.
Based on a series of patients with previously uncontrolled
seizures, Callaghan and colleagues report that nearly 5 percent
of patients per year will enter seizure remission, usually as a re-
sult of medication changes. While this finding is clearly less than
optimal, the authors note that their data provide realistic hope
that persistent medical attention may eventually improve a pa-
tient’s seizure control. Their assertion is particularly important
since most of these patients are not candidates for improving
seizure control with surgery.
The authors contrast their findings with those of Kwan and
Brodie; however, it is helpful to remember that the studies differ
significantly in design and intent. The current study included
patients who met strict criteria for poor seizure control (i.e.,
more than one seizure per month for 3 months, after trying at
least two medications). Patients were treated aggressively, fol-
lowed for roughly 3 years, and were considered in remission if
they experienced a 6-month period without seizures. In con-
trast, Kwan and Brodie studied patients with newly diagnosed
epilepsy, following them for as long as 16 years, and considered
seizure free if they had not had seizures during the year prior to
their last follow-up visit (1). Thus, Callaghan et al. scrutinized
previously intractable cases for improvement, while Kwan and
Brodie emphasized imperfect seizure control in patients who

started treatment with a clean slate. These studies should be
regarded as complimentary rather than discordant.
Callaghan and colleagues used Kaplan–Meier methods to
estimate the cumulative seizure remission rate. They wisely
performed a separate analysis censoring surgery, since many
patients became seizure free as a result of their operations.
The estimated remission rates are likely to be accurate for the
population studied, although it is not clear whether the results
would apply to patients who were not in long-term care at an
institution. Furthermore, a prospective study of patients with
refractory epilepsy might yield less favorable results than were
found in the retrospective study by Callaghan et al.
A modest proportion of the patients entering seizure-free
intervals did so without an obvious temporal relationship to
anticonvulsant manipulation. This outcome suggests that the
natural history of refractory epilepsy for some patients may
include good periods rather than relentless seizures. Berg and
colleagues have shown that children with refractory epilepsy of-
ten have periods of remission before becoming refractory and
that a significant subset enter remission again later (4). Taken
together, these observations support a concept of seizure con-
trol as a moving target, necessitating careful consideration of
methods for analysis. The methods used in the Callaghan et al.
study distinguish patients who sometimes do well from those
who do not.
The authors also attempt to define predictors of intractabil-
ity;however,noneofthefactorsanalyzedremainedsignificantin
multivariate analysis. They make the point that the factors that
were significant in their univariate analysis are likely to be true
predictors, given that they have been replicated in other studies
(5,6) or make intuitive sense. These factors include mental re-
tardation, status epilepticus, number of medications failed, and
duration of intractability. MRI and EEG abnormalities did not
predict intractability. Given the uncertainty of the independent
predictive value of the defined risk factors, they cannot be used
at this time to confidently stratify risk in individuals, though
they may still be useful as rough indicators of intractability.
The most important consequence of this study is to serve as
a reminder that counseling patients on seizure control prognosis
is a tricky business that necessitates more than cursory explana-
tions. Pertinent to the discussion is the fact that a large number
of patients will have variable seizure control throughout life
and that treatment success (both medical and surgical) will be
superimposed on that background. Indeed, a recent long-term
study of seizure surgery outcomes indicates that freedom from
seizures may vary significantly over time. While some patients
who were seizure-free at 2 years, developed recurrent seizures,
20 percent of the people who were still having seizures 2 years
after surgery were seizure-free 8 years later (7). Callaghan and
colleagues’ study is a reminder that no matter how things are
going, improvement may be just around the corner for those
patients with seemingly persistent seizures.

NONCONVULSIVE SEIZURES IN TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY: WHAT YOU
DON’T SEE CAN HURT YOU
Nonconvulsive Electrographic Seizures after Traumatic Brain Injury Result in a Delayed, Prolonged Increase in
Intracranial Pressure and Metabolic Crisis. Vespa PM, Miller C, McArthur D, Eliseo M, Etchepare M, Hirt D, Glenn
TC, Martin N, Hovda D. Crit Care Med 2007; [Epub ahead of print].
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether nonconvulsive
electrographic post-traumatic seizures result in increases in intracranial pressure and microdialysis lactate/pyruvate ratio. DESIGN:
Prospective monitoring with retrospective data analysis. SETTING: Single center academic neurologic intensive care unit. PATIENTS:
Twenty moderate to severe traumatic brain injury patients (Glasgow Coma Score 3–13). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:
Continuous electroencephalography and cerebral microdialysis were performed for 7 days after injury. Ten patients had seizures and
were compared with a matched cohort of traumatic brain injury patients without seizures. The seizures were repetitive and constituted
status epilepticus in seven of ten patients. Using a within-subject design, post-traumatic seizures resulted in episodic increases in
intracranial pressure (22.4 ± 7 vs. 12.8 ± 4.3 mm Hg; p < .001) and an episodic increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio (49.4 ± 16 vs. 23.8 ±
7.6; p < .001) in the seizure group. Using a between-subjects comparison, the seizure group demonstrated a higher mean intracranial
pressure (17.6 ± 6.5 vs. 12.2 ± 4.2 mm Hg; p < .001), a higher mean lactate/pyruvate ratio (38.6 ± 18 vs. 27 ± 9; p < .001) compared
with nonseizure patients. The intracranial pressure and lactate/pyruvate ratio remained elevated beyond postinjury hour 100 in the
seizure group but not the nonseizure group (p < .02). CONCLUSION: Post-traumatic seizures result in episodic as well as long-lasting
increases in intracranial pressure and microdialysis lactate/pyruvate ratio. These data suggest that post-traumatic seizures represent
a therapeutic target for patients with traumatic brain injury.
COMMENTARY
N
onconvulsive seizures are common in critically ill pa-
tients. In fact, multiple studies have demonstrated that
the majority of seizures occurring in these patients are noncon-
vulsive and can only be recognized via EEG monitoring (1).
Are they harmful? Although no class I or II trials have been
performed to date, there is substantial evidence that they may
be harmful, particularly in the injured brain. Vespa and col-
leagues continue to contribute meaningfully to this literature
in the current report.
In the current article, the authors compared ten patients
with traumatic brain injury and seizures to ten other trau-
matic brain injury patients without seizures; the two groups
were matched for head CT findings, age, and Glasgow coma
score. All seizures happened to be nonconvulsive, and all pa-
tients received prophylactic phenytoin for 7 days. Rigorous neu-
rological/neurosurgical intensive care unit (NICU) treatment
was applied, with careful management of intracranial pressure
[goal <20], cerebral perfusion pressure [kept at >60], jugu-
lar venous O2 saturation [kept at 60–70%], and temperature
[kept at 37–37.6◦C]), with sedation maintained with propo-
fol. EEG was recorded with 12 electrodes, continuously dis-
played at the bedside, and reviewed a minimum of three times
daily. Total power trending software also was used and dis-
played at the bedside to aid in recognition of possible seizures,
though raw EEG tracings always were reviewed for definitive
diagnosis. Intracranial pressure and intracerebral microdialysis
(a measure of metabolites in the parenchymal interstitial fluid)
data were obtained hourly as part of routine clinical care at the
center.
The results demonstrated that nonconvulsive seizures
(often associated with periodic discharges as well) corre-
sponded with higher intracranial pressure and higher brain lac-
tate/pyruvate ratio (LPR; see following description for signifi-
cance), often reaching abnormal levels (i.e., >20 mm Hg and
>40, respectively). The timing of these elevations correlated
with the presence of seizures, based on averaging the hourly
samples over 12-hour epochs. Interestingly, there was a bimodal
peak occurrence of seizures at 29- and 140-hours postinjury. Ic-
tal intracranial pressure (during the 12-hour period beginning
with seizure onset) was an average of 12 mm Hg higher than
pre-ictal, and ictal LPR was double that of pre-ictal LPR on
average. Elevated glutamate also was seen around the time of
seizures, averaging 13.1 in the 12-hour designated ictal period
versus 2.6 interictally (p < 0.001). Mortality and Glasgow Out-
come Score outcomes did not differ significantly between the
seizure and nonseizure groups.
These results add to the growing evidence that seizures,
including nonconvulsive ones, are harmful to humans. Prior
evidence includes the following:
• The delay to diagnosis and duration of nonconvulsive
status epilepticus are each independent predictors of
worse outcome (2).

• Thepresenceofeithernonconvulsiveseizuresorperiodic
discharges is an independent predictor of worse outcome
in multiple patient populations (1).
• In patients with epilepsy but without acute brain injury,
prolonged nonconvulsive seizures can lead to permanent
neurological injury, albeit rarely (3).
• Neuron-specific enolase, a marker of neuronal injury,
can be elevated after nonconvulsive status epilepticus,
even without acute brain injury (4).
• In patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, nonconvul-
sive seizures were associated with increased mass effect
and shift on imaging, worsening neurological examina-
tion, and a trend toward worse outcome in one study
(5), and expanding hemorrhages, with a trend toward
worse outcome in another (6).
• Seizure activity can cause elevations in glutamate that
reachneurotoxiclevels(7)anddelayedelevationsinglyc-
erol, suggesting membrane breakdown (8).
• Seizures are associated with peri-injury depolarizations
(similar or identical to cortical spreading depression),
another likely contributor to secondary neuronal injury
after an acute brain insult (9).
The evidence of the damaging effects of nonconvulsive
seizures in animal studies includes the following:
• Seizures are associated with increases in blood flow,
metabolism, excitatory amino acid levels, and lactate.
• In a controlled, rat middle cerebral artery occlusion
model, nonconvulsive seizures were associated with
larger infarcts and a tripling of mortality (10).
• In a rat low-dose pilocarpine model, nonconvulsive sta-
tus epilepticus was found to result in long-term motor
deficits and impaired social behavior (11).
In contrast, the aggressive treatment often required to stop
nonconvulsive seizures in critically ill patients is also poten-
tially harmful (12), leaving room for ongoing controversy and
appropriate variations in approach to management.
Elevated intracranial pressure remains a major issue in the
management of patients with traumatic brain injury. In many
academic NICUs, invasive multimodality monitoring of pa-
tients with a variety of acute brain injuries is a common prac-
tice, including monitoring intracranial pressure, brain tissue
oxygen tension, cerebral blood flow, brain temperature, jugular
venous oxygen saturation, and multiple metabolic parameters
via cerebral microdialysis. These invasively obtained data are
interpreted in conjunction with the usual vital signs, EEG (es-
pecially in the past couple years), and physical examination.
Cerebral microdialysis was approved for clinical use by the
United States Food and Drug Administration in 2002, and
an international consensus statement supporting its use was
published in 2004 (13). The most reliable measure of neuronal
stress appears to be the LPR—a measure of the redox state of
the brain. There are two types of elevation in LPR: ischemic
(type I, with prominent elevation in lactate) and nonischemic
(type II, with drop in pyruvate). The type II changes often have
remained unexplained, but to date, most studies in published
literature on cerebral microdialysis did not obtain concomitant
EEG recordings.
The limitations of the study by Vespa and colleagues in-
clude the relatively small number of patients, the widely spaced
sampling (hourly), the lack of clear definition of an electro-
graphic seizure (not a trivial issue), the lack of any sample EEG
tracings, and the nonrandomized nature of this retrospective
study. Reporting on the relative utility of the quantitative EEG
and bedside review (i.e., how often seizures were detected via
these techniques) would have been quite useful. Data on the
effect of treatment on intracranial pressure and LPR also would
have been valuable—do they normalize when seizures stop? If
so, how quickly? Finally, as the authors point out, intracranial
recordings may show much more extensive epileptic activity
than seen on scalp EEG. In fact, a recent report, using miniature
intracranial transcortical depth electrode recordings in NICU
patients requiring invasive monitoring, provides preliminary
evidence to support this theory (14).
Despite these limitations, this is the largest and best in-
vestigation into the acute physiologic effects of nonconvulsive
seizures in acute brain injury. The authors’ conclusions that
these data “confirm a long-held, but previously unsupported,
premise that electrographic seizures are deleterious for traumatic
brain injury patients” and their suggestion “that seizures can po-
tentiate the metabolic distress of the brain injured patient and
hence may lead to permanent cellular injury” are both justified
and important. In addition to further studies to confirm and
expand upon this one, a logical next step would be to investi-
gate whether intervening in a timely fashion can prevent these
adverse physiologic effects and ultimately improve outcome.

. Epilepsia 2007;48(9):1697–1702. Epub 2007 May 23.
OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of
age on different aspects of temporal lobe seizure semiology. METHODS: We performed a video analysis of 605 archived seizures
from 155 consecutive patients (age 10 months to 49 years) selected by seizure freedom after temporal lobectomy. Eighty patients
had hippocampal sclerosis (HS). Beside semiological seizure classification, we assessed age dependency of several axes of seizure
semiology: (1) aura, (2) number of different lateralizing signs, occurrence of ictal (3) emotional signs, (4) autonomic symptoms, (5)
automatisms, and (6) secondary generalization as well as (7) the ratio of motor seizure components. RESULTS: From the 155 patients,
117 reported aura, 39 had ictal emotional signs, 51 had autonomic symptoms, 130 presented automatisms, while 18 patients showed
secondary generalization at least once during their seizures. Altogether 369 (median: 2/patient) different lateralizing signs were recorded.
Frequency of HS (p < 0.001), ictal automatisms (p < 0.001), secondary generalization (p = 0.014), number of different lateralizing signs
(p < 0.001) increased while the ratio of motor seizure component (p = 0.007) decreased by age. Auras, emotional symptoms, and
autonomic signs occurred independently of patients’ ages. Hippocampal sclerosis adjusted linear models revealed that the frequency
of automatisms and secondarily generalized seizures as well as the number of different lateralizing signs are HS-independent significant
variables. CONCLUSION: Our findings support that brain maturation significantly influences the evolution of some important aspects
(motor seizures, lateralizing signs) of temporal lobe seizure semiology. Conversely, other aspects (aura, emotional, and autonomic
signs) are independent of the maturation process. This is the first report investigating age dependency of epileptic seizure semiology
comparing all age groups.
COMMENTARY
A
lthough over 70 percent of temporal lobe seizure disorders
begin in childhood, early recognition is often impeded by
a nonspecific semiology, multifocal-interictal and widespread-
ictal EEG phenomena, and an initial lack of characteristic MRI
features (1–3). Previous studies had disclosed a higher incidence
of motor features in children with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)
than that reported in adults (4,5). This current, retrospective,
cross-sectional study by Fogarasi and colleagues confirms these
findings in a larger cohort and adds the unique feature of video

ictal analysis of children and adults with TLE. Unfortunately,
only a longitudinal study will be able to determine whether and
when the childhood semiology pattern found in these studies
evolves to the more familiar adult pattern.
Several factors may contribute to the authors’ finding of a
greater incidence of motor phenomena in childhood than adult
TLE. Lateral neocortical TLE occurs more commonly in chil-
dren, whereas 90 percent of adult TLE originates mesially (2,6).
Although the abundant mesial lateral temporal, reciprocal con-
nections produce an ictal semiology principally shared by adults
and children (7), clonic motor features and early ictal arm dys-
tonia suggest a lateral temporal seizure origin (7,8). Prominent
lateral temporal efferent fibers to the prefrontal cortex provide
direct entry into the premotor cortex (9,10), while hippocampal
efferent fibers through the subiculum project principally to the
orbitofrontal and mesial frontal cortices (11). The greater inci-
dence of extratemporal interictal spike foci in childhood TLE
(3) may facilitate seizure propagation because such multiple foci
may impair confinement of an epileptic discharge to a single re-
gion (12). Two additional factors that are characteristic of the
immature brain with epilepsy may also promote ictal spread:
1) greater gap junction communication in immature brain (13)
and 2) failure of the normal cortical pruning in the presence of
epileptogenesis (14).
If the authors had categorized automatisms into oroali-
mentary and manual/gestural types they may have confirmed a
predominance of the former in children less than 5 to 6 years of
age and the latter in older subjects, as found in previous studies
(15). The increasing incidence of secondarily generalized tonic–
clonic seizures occurring with age found in the current article
seems at variance with the higher motor seizure component ra-
tio seen in young children. The possible effect of antiepileptic
drug type and quantity on these findings is not stated.
The many factors involved in effectiveness of epilepsy
surgery diminish somewhat the validity of postoperative seizure
freedom in confirming seizure origin. Residual antiepileptic
drugs, multiple seizure types, and limitation of surgical resec-
tion to spare significant functions are some of these factors.
Additionally, a minimum follow-up period of 1 year (such as
occurred in this study) is too short for a seizure localizing confir-
matory role: seizures restarted 11 to 28 months after temporal
lobectomy in 4 of 15 children in one study (16).
In summary, data from this study combined with earlier
relevant works provide a valuable guide to the pediatric epilep-
tologist. In a child with unexpectedly intractable focal seizures
with prominent motor phenomena, multifocal EEG epilepti-
form activity, and a nondiagnostic MRI, TLE manifestations of
a more mature brain may evolve as the brain matures. Valuable
ictal lateralizing signs also may emerge over time, as Fogarasi and
colleague’s group ascertained. These ictal semiological changes
transpiring with increased age in childhood onset TLE thus far
have received scant attention in major textbooks.
