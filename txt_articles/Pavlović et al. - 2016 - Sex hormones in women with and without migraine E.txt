Sex hormones in women with and without
migraine
Evidence of migraine-specific hormone profiles
ABSTRACT
Objective: To compare daily sex hormone levels and rates of change between women with history
of migraine and controls.
Methods: History of migraine, daily headache diaries, and daily hormone data were collected in
ovulatory cycles of pre- and early perimenopausal women in the Study of Women’s Health Across
the Nation. Peak hormone levels, average daily levels, and within-woman day-to-day rates of
decline over the 5 days following each hormone peak were calculated in ovulatory cycles for
conjugated urinary estrogens (E1c), pregnanediol-3-glucuronide, luteinizing hormone, and
follicle-stimulating hormone. Comparisons were made between migraineurs and controls using
2-sample t tests on the log scale with results reported as geometric means.
Results: The sample included 114 women with history of migraine and 223 controls. Analyses of
within-woman rates of decline showed that E1c decline over the 2 days following the luteal peak
was greater in migraineurs for both absolute rate of decline (33.8 [95% confidence interval 28.0–
40.8] pg/mgCr vs 23.1 [95% confidence interval 20.1–26.6] pg/mgCr, p 5 0.002) and percent
change (40% vs 30%, p , 0.001). There was no significant difference between migraineurs and
controls in absolute peak or daily E1c, pregnanediol-3-glucuronide, luteinizing hormone, and
follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Secondary analyses demonstrated that, among migraineurs,
the rate of E1c decline did not differ according to whether a headache occurred during the cycle
studied.
Conclusions: Migraineurs are characterized by faster late luteal phase E1c decline compared to
controls. The timing and rate of estrogen withdrawal before menses may be a marker of neuroen-
docrine vulnerability in women with migraine. Neurology® 2016;87:49–56

Migraine is predominantly a disorder of women that has long been linked with sex hormones. It
poses a significant public health burden, particularly during the reproductive years.1–3 For the
majority of women with migraine, headache attacks are more likely during the 2 days preceding
the onset of menstrual bleeding and for the first 3 days of menses.4–7 These perimenstrual attacks
are commonly labeled menstrual migraine and, according to the “estrogen withdrawal”
migraine-triggering hypothesis,8–10 are thought to be attributable to estrogen decline in the late
luteal phase (figure 1).9,10
Although the role of hormones in migraine has long been implicated, there are limited data
regarding menstrual hormonal patterns in women with migraine10–14 and even fewer studies
comparing hormone levels and patterns between women with history of migraine (MHx) and
controls.11,14 Results of prior studies have been inconsistent and limited by small samples and

cycles.11,12,14 The one positive study reported
elevated estradiol and progesterone levels in 12
women with migraine compared to 8 controls.11
Furthermore, prior studies have been limited to
comparisons of group mean hormone levels and
have not explored within-woman hormone
change in relation to migraine.
The Study of Women’s Health Across the
Nation
(SWAN)
Daily
Hormone
Study
(DHS) provided the opportunity to assess
whether hormone levels and rates of change
differ for women with migraine compared
with controls. To explore the hypothesis that
women with migraine have distinct hormone
patterns, we compared peak and daily hor-
mone levels (up to 5 days post peak) as well
as mean within-woman daily rates of decline
in ovulatory menstrual cycles for MHx and
controls (figure 1). Secondary analyses within
the migraine group examined whether hor-
monal patterns distinguished cycles in which
acute headache occurred.
METHODS Participants. SWAN is a multisite, multiethnic,
observational, longitudinal study designed to characterize biolog-
ical and psychosocial changes occurring across the menopausal
transition.15 Details of study design have been reported by Sowers
et al.15: “baseline eligibility criteria included being aged 42–52
years, having an intact uterus and at least one ovary, not being
pregnant or lactating, not using oral contraceptives or hormone
therapy, and having a menstrual cycle in the 3 months before the
baseline interview.” In 1996–1997, 3,302 women were enrolled
and followed with annual clinic assessments.
The SWAN DHS included 848 women who were not using
exogenous hormones and who completed a daily, first morning
voided urine collection for an entire menstrual cycle ending in
bleeding or for 50 days, whichever came first.16 They also com-
pleted a daily symptom diary that included headaches.
Analyses are based on the first ovulatory cycle with evidence of
luteal activity (ELA) collected among pre- or early-perimenopausal
women in the DHS. Of the 732 women with an ELA cycle, 627
had complete data for history of migraine and demographics and
completed DHS daily diary headache data on at least 80% of the
DHS collection days. The migraine group included 114 women
with self-reported history of having ever been diagnosed with
migraine before their first DHS ELA cycle. Potential controls were
women without a history of diagnosed migraine at any SWAN visit
before their first DHS ELA cycle (n 5 513). Because migraine is
underdiagnosed in the population,17 we excluded women who re-
ported a severe headache in the DHS daily diary to avoid inclusion
of undiagnosed migraineurs in the control group (n 5 290). Thus,
analyses include 337 women: 114 migraineurs and 223 controls.
Peak hormone levels and patterns among women excluded from the
controls were very similar to those of the included controls.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. SWAN protocols were approved by the institutional
review board of each site. Written informed consent was obtained
from each participant.

nificant increase in migraine occurrence. (B) The focus of analyses of the manuscript, where

 metabolites estrone conjugates [E1c]), luteinizing hormone (LH),
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and the progesterone urinary
metabolite pregnanediol-3-glucuronide (Pdg) were measured using
chemiluminescent assays.18 Concentrations were normalized to
creatinine excretion. Daily hormone profiles were categorized as
ovulatory (ELA) by previously described algorithms.19,20 Previous
studies have demonstrated that urinary levels of these hormones,
collected and measured by these methods, mirror serum hormone
patterns during the menstrual cycle in eumenorrheic control par-
ticipants so closely that patterns of serum and urinary gonado-
tropins and sex steroids may be considered equivalent.21–23
The criteria for the occurrence of an E1c peak16 and for an
LH surge24 are validated and previously reported. Visual inspec-
tion of daily levels plotted throughout the cycle was performed
and in cases in which discrepancies occurred, algorithmic catego-
ries were overridden by consensus of 3 observers with expertise in
reproductive endocrinology.
Migraine diagnosis. At each visit, SWAN participants were
asked, “Has a doctor, nurse practitioner, or other health care
provider ever told you that you have migraine headaches?”
Although this question does not meet the International Classifi-
cation of Headache Disorders (ICHD)25 criteria for migraine, it is
well accepted that self-reported medical diagnosis identifies
migraine with high specificity but modest sensitivity.26,27
Therefore, nearly everyone with a reported medical diagnosis of
migraine meets the ICHD case definition, but many with
migraine are never diagnosed.17 As noted, to eliminate false
negatives from the control group, potential controls who reported
moderate to severe headaches in their DHS diaries were excluded.
Occurrence of headache during the DHS cycle. Daily dia-
ries covering 18 symptoms in the past 24 hours were completed
at bedtime. Participants were asked to “think back over the last 24
hours and indicate whether or not you had a headache,” and were
asked to rate it on a scale from 0 (no headache) to 4 (severe
headache). A migraine during the DHS cycle was defined as at
least 1 day with a headache rated as moderate to severe.
Menopause status and other covariates. Primary race/eth-
nicity was self-identified as black or African American, non-
Hispanic Caucasian, Chinese or Chinese American, Japanese or
Japanese American, or Hispanic. Menopause status was based on
self-reported menstrual irregularity, ascertained retrospectively at
each visit. Premenopausal status was defined as the presence of
menses within the past 3 months, with no decrease in cycle pre-
dictability. Early perimenopause was defined as the presence of
menses within the past 3 months that had become less predictable
in the past year or since last visit.28–30 Socioeconomic stress was
defined by response to the question, “How hard is it for you to pay
for the very basics like food, housing, medical care, and heating?”
Weight was measured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 kg using
a calibrated digital scale (Tanita BWB 800). Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated from these measures: weight (kg)/height (m)2.
Statistical analysis. The t test and x2 statistics were used to
compare characteristics of MHx and controls. Peak hormone levels
were compared for MHx and controls using t tests for unadjusted
differences and multivariable linear regression to adjust for covariates:
age, continuous BMI, race/ethnicity, menopausal status, socioeco-
nomic stress, years of education, and smoking history. Specifically,
we compared peak hormone levels for the E1c periovulatory and
luteal (premenstrual) peaks, LH and FSH, and the midluteal Pdg
peak. We then examined group mean daily hormone levels over the
5 days following the peak for each hormone. Finally, we compared
the mean within-woman absolute and percent daily changes in
hormones over the 5 days post peak for MHx and controls.
Secondary analyses were conducted among the MHx to deter-
mine whether hormone patterns are related to headache occur-
rence within a cycle. MHx were divided into 2 groups,
according to whether they reported a moderate to severe headache
during the cycle studied. These groups were compared to each
other and to control women using analysis of variance for unad-
justed differences and multivariable linear regression to adjust for
covariates listed above. Model assumptions/fit were assessed,
including linear associations of outcomes with continuous predic-
tors, and normally distributed residuals with constant variance.
Hormone measures were analyzed on the log scale because of
their skewed distribution. Results were reported as geometric
and arithmetic means and 95% confidence interval (CI).

were more likely to be white or black and less likely to
be Chinese or Japanese. Migraineurs were also more

 over the 5 days following the periovulatory and luteal
(premenstrual) peaks, and also peak and daily levels of
Pdg following the midluteal progesterone peak. As
expected, the absolute value of the periovulatory
E1c peak was higher than the luteal (premenstrual)
peak in both groups. Although both E1c peaks were
slightly higher in migraineurs than in controls, differ-
ences were not statistically significant. Mean absolute
daily E1c levels over the 5 days following the perio-
vulatory and luteal estrogen peaks were not signifi-
cantly different for migraineurs and controls. The Pdg
midluteal peak was slightly higher in controls than in
migraineurs, however the differences were not statis-
tically significant. Figure 2 displays curves for mean
E1c (panels A.a and B.a) and Pdg (panels C.a) on
each day following the peaks and illustrates the over-
lap between migraineurs and controls.
Absolute and percent daily change in estrogen and

daily rates of decline (panels A.b, B.b, and C.b) and
daily percent change (panels A.c, B.c, and C.c) for the
5 days following the E1c periovulatory (panel A) and
luteal peaks (panel B) and the midluteal Pdg peak
(panel C). There were significant differences in E1c
decline in the late luteal phase. Migraineurs had
a greater rate of E1c decline over the 2 days following
the luteal peak than did controls for both absolute
change (panel B.b) (33.8 [95% CI 28.0–40.8] pg/

Neurology.org). This difference remained significant
following adjustment for age; race/ethnicity; site;

observed following the midluteal Pdg decline between
migraineurs and controls (table e-2).

and LH peaks.
Analyses within migraineurs. Figure 3 shows results of
secondary analyses within the migraine group. Mi-
graineurs were grouped according to presence of
headache rated moderate to severe during the DHS
cycle studied (n 5 89 yes, n 5 25 no) to determine
whether, among migraineurs, hormone patterns are
related to the occurrence of headache within a cycle.
Hormone patterns for migraineurs were similar
regardless of the occurrence of headache in the cycle,
and the difference between migraineurs and controls
was significant regardless of whether the migraineurs
reported a headache.
DISCUSSION We present a finding that migraineurs
have distinct patterns of estrogen decline in the late
luteal phase compared to controls. Our goal was to
compare patterns of daily circulating sex hormone levels
in women with and without history of migraine. We
extend prior work in this area by examining not only
group differences in daily and peak sex hormone levels,
but also average within-woman daily rates of decline
from peak. Our findings expand the “estrogen
withdrawal hypothesis” of migraine triggering8,10,31 by
offering the following observations: (1) there is no
significant difference in estrogen peak levels or mean
daily levels between migraineurs and controls; (2)
however, there is a significant difference in the rate
of estrogen decline specifically in the late luteal
phase, while there is no difference in the rate of
decline in the periovulatory phase; and (3) among
migraineurs, the rate of estrogen decline does not
distinguish cycles with and without an acute
headache.

 Our results show that differences in the rate of
estrogen decline for migraineurs and controls are
dependent on menstrual cycle phase and timing, spe-
cifically the rate of decline over the 2 days following
the luteal E1c peak. These results shed light on
long-standing questions regarding estrogen with-
drawal and migraine, namely: why is the estrogen
effect most pronounced in the perimenstrual period?
Prior studies have consistently shown that migraine
attacks are associated with estrogen withdrawal dur-
ing the late luteal phase (premenstrual), while the
association of migraine and estrogen decline in the
follicular phase (periovulatory) has been controver-
sial.4–6,32,33 One explanation that has been put forth
to explain the menstrual cycle phase–dependent
headache occurrence due to estrogen withdrawal is
that a period of sustained high estrogen such as occurs
in the late luteal phase is necessary for precipitation of
headache by estrogen withdrawal.
Herein, presented findings offer a possible alterna-
tive explanation, showing that migraineurs have
a faster rate of estrogen decline in the late luteal phase,
while the rate of estrogen withdrawal following the
periovulatory peak does not differ for migraineurs
and controls. Furthermore, we show that migraineurs
experience a faster rate of estrogen decline following
the luteal estrogen peak regardless of whether they
experience a severe headache during that cycle, offer-
ing an explanation for the clinical observation that
women do not experience migraine with every men-
strual cycle. Our results offer an expanded role of
estrogen in perimenstrual migraine in that the estro-
gen withdrawal is not a direct trigger of migraine as
commonly conceptualized. We propose a “two-hit”
hypothesis of perimenstrual migraine initiation,
whereby the more rapid estrogen decline is an endog-
enous trait of women with migraine that confers neu-
roendocrine vulnerability that may facilitate initiation
of migraine attack(s) by common triggers, such as
stress, disrupted sleep, foods, and wine.34
An endogenous difference in estrogen processing
in women with migraine is further supported by

No significant differences were observed in absolute levels and mean daily levels on each day post periovulatory E1c peak (A.a), luteal E1c (B.a), and mid-
luteal Pdg (C.a) between women with history of migraine and controls. Absolute daily rates of decline from periovulatory E1c peak (A.b), late luteal E1c (B.b),
and midluteal Pdg (C.b), and daily percent change (A.c, B.c, and C.c) for 5 days post peaks were calculated within woman. The significant difference was
observed in E1c decline 2 days post luteal peak in women with history of migraine vs controls (B.b and B.c). Red asterisk marks the significant finding of

 a study of postmenopausal women in which estrogen
decline following a single injection of estradiol trig-
gered a migraine only in women with a premenopausal
history of migraine associated with menstruation.35
This neurovulnerability to rapid estrogen decline
may be due to the disruption of the serotonergic mech-
anisms involved in inhibition of pain leading to
disruption of the trigeminovascular system.14,36,37 Fur-
thermore, other hormones, and particularly progester-
one, may modulate the effects of estrogen on migraine.
While the late luteal estrogen decline is accompanied
by progesterone decline, the effect of periovulatory
estrogen decline on migraine may be counteracted by
the rising progesterone, thus leading to a decrease in
migraine occurrence.
Few studies have compared daily sex hormone lev-
els between controls and migraineurs, and results are
conflicting. A small study in the 1970s showed higher
estrogen levels in migraineurs vs controls.11 In con-
trast, a recent study reported lower estradiol levels in
women with menstrually related migraine during
days 19 to 21 of the menstrual cycle.14 As this gen-
erally precedes the luteal peak, it is unclear how these
findings relate to the present work. In our signifi-
cantly larger and ethnically diverse study population,
peak estrogen levels in migraineurs were not statisti-
cally significantly different from those in controls.
Prior studies focusing only on women with
migraine have failed to identify a critical threshold
or rate of estrogen change required to precipitate
migraine, and have proposed that falling levels and
prewithdrawal priming are more important than
absolute levels and rate of change.10,38 It is critical
to note that these studies examined only group mean
hormone levels and did not examine within-woman
rates of change in hormones. Our results underscore
the need for analyses of within-woman changes in
hormones. We observed no differences in group
mean hormone peaks and daily hormone levels for
migraineurs and controls. However, the within-
woman analyses revealed a distinct pattern of faster
premenstrual estrogen decline among migraineurs.
That is, when we examined the levels of E1c, no
differences between migraineurs and controls were
observed. But when within-woman change in E1c
was examined, a migraine history–related difference
was observed.
This study has several limitations. Migraine diag-
nosis was based on self-report. Prior work has shown
that almost everyone with a medical diagnosis of
migraine meets an ICHD-based case definition, but
many people with migraine are never diagnosed.17,39
Thus, we are confident that migraineurs in this study
have the disorder although some with migraine may
have been excluded. While we excluded controls who
reported moderate to severe headaches in the DHS, it
is possible that some with migraine who have not
received physician diagnoses and are currently expe-
riencing only mild headaches were included in the
control group. However, this misclassification would
have diluted the observed differences. Furthermore,
the control group had proportionately more Chinese
and Japanese women, while the migraineur group had
more white and black women. Racial/ethnic differ-
ence in sex hormones have been reported,40 with sig-
nificantly lower E1c in black, Chinese, and Japanese

 women compared with white and Hispanic women.
These differences could be contributing to the observed
associations between migraineurs and controls. How-
ever, we found that hormone patterns, but not absolute
hormone levels, were related to history of migraine, and
furthermore, adjustment for race/ethnicity did not
change our results. Although analyses included only
ovulatory cycles, these cycles were primarily among
early perimenopausal women who may have somewhat
elevated E1c levels relative to premenopausal women.21
Finally, as participation in the DHS is demanding, the
generalizability of the results from this highly motivated
group may be somewhat limited.
The strengths of this study are the careful charac-
terization of menstrual cycles and the ability to exam-
ine daily sex hormone fluctuations in those cycles.
Furthermore, the size of the study sample and the
availability of hormone levels over complete men-
strual cycles are unprecedented in the available
literature.
Overall, we demonstrated that while absolute peak
and day-to-day endogenous sex hormone levels were
similar for migraineurs and controls, there were sig-
nificant differences in the rate of estrogen withdrawal
that were phase-specific (late luteal) and time-specific
(2 days post peak). Furthermore, these differences
occurred irrespective of whether migraineurs experi-
enced headache within the cycle studied, suggesting
neuroendocrine vulnerability in women with migraine.
Future studies are needed to examine the day-to-day
occurrence of headache in relation to daily hormone
changes and to explore potential mechanisms that
determine the phase- and time-dependent rates of
estrogen decline in women with migraine.
