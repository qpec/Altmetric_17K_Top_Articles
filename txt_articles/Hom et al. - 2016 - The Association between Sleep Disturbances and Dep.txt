Study Objectives: To investigate emotion regulation difficulties in association with self-reported insomnia symptoms, nightmares, and depression symptoms 
in a sample of current and retired firefighters.
Methods: A total of 880 current and retired United States firefighters completed a web-based survey of firefighter behavioral health. Self-report measures 
included the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Insomnia Severity Index, PTSD Checklist, and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale.
Results: A notable portion of participants reported clinically significant depression symptoms (39.6%) and insomnia symptoms (52.7%), as well as nightmare 
problems (19.2%), each of which demonstrated a strong association with emotion regulation difficulties (rs = 0.56–0.80). Bootstrapped mediation analyses 
revealed that the indirect effects of overall emotion regulation difficulties were significant both for the relationship between insomnia and depression (95% CI: 
0.385–0.566) and nightmares and depression (95% CI: 1.445–2.365). Limited access to emotion regulation strategies emerged as the strongest, significant 
indirect effect for both relationships (insomnia 95% CI: 0.136–0.335; nightmares 95% CI: 0.887–1.931).
Conclusions: Findings extend previous affective neuroscience research by providing evidence that insomnia and nightmares may influence depression 
symptoms specifically through the pathway of explicit emotion regulation difficulties. Sleep disturbances may impair the ability to access and leverage 
emotion regulation strategies effectively, thus conferring risk for negative affect and depression.

INTRODUCTION
Firefighters are at elevated risk for sleep disturbances and 
depression.1–3 In one study utilizing a sample of 112 firefight-
ers, 59% of respondents reported disturbed sleep patterns 
and/or sleep deprivation and 11% reported clinically signifi-
cant depression symptoms.3 These observed rates have been 
attributed, in part, to the occupational hazards and stressors 
experienced by firefighters,1–3 such as exposure to trauma and 
shiftwork schedules. Given these findings, there is a clear need 
to identify points of intervention that can be effectively tar-
geted to prevent the onset of sleep disturbances and depression 
within this high-risk population.
Although insomnia is a cardinal symptom of depression, re-
search has also illuminated its role as a primary sleep disorder 
that may serve as a precursor to and prodromal feature of de-
pression.4 Insomnia has been found to predict depression on-
set across age groups, populations, and diverse study designs, 
conferring an approximately two-fold increased risk for its de-
velopment.5 Further, even though the temporal relationship be-
tween nightmares and depression is less well established, some 
reports demonstrate a positive association between nightmare 
severity and depression symptoms.6,7 Numerous studies have 
also found that greater severity and frequency of nightmares 
and insomnia serve as an independent risk factor for suicidal 
ideation and behaviors.8 Consequently, there is strong rationale

to delineate explanatory pathways that may help to explain 
symptom relationships between sleep disturbances (i.e., in-
somnia and nightmares) and depression.
A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed to 
explain this link. These include stress response as a media-
tor of the relationship between insomnia and depression, gene 
and environment contributions, shared neurobiological path-
ways (e.g., glutamate system, monoaminergic transmitters), 
learned helplessness and physiological hyperarousal, and the 
possibility that sleep disturbances impact the processing of 
BRIEF SUMMARY
Current Knowledge/Study Rationale: Insomnia has been 
demonstrated to be a robust predictor of depression onset, and 
distinct yet related lines of inquiry from basic affective neuroscience 
research have established a relationship between sleep and 
emotion. Despite this, little is known about explicit emotion regulation 
difficulties as a possible explanatory factor in the association 
between sleep problems and depression symptoms, including 
among firefighters—a sample at elevated risk for insomnia, 
nightmares, and depression.
Study Impact: Difficulties in emotion regulation, particularly lack 
of access to emotion regulation strategies, may in part explain the 
link between sleep disturbances and depression among firefighters. 
Emotion dysregulation may be an important therapeutic target 
for reducing depression risk for firefighters and related groups 
experiencing insomnia and nightmares.

negative emotions.9–11 This latter conjecture that emotion reg-
ulation difficulties mediate the relationship between insomnia 
and depression is particularly compelling,12 especially con-
sidering findings from basic affective neuroscience research 
evaluating the relationship between sleep and emotion, which 
will now be discussed.
Notably, experimental studies of sleep restriction demon-
strate that sleep plays an important role in cognitive process-
ing, with sleep disturbances negatively affecting functioning 
across a broad range of domains, including consolidation of 
memories and processing of information related to emotions.13 
For example, laboratory studies among healthy young adults 
demonstrate that sleep deprivation (20 to 31 consecutive hours 
without sleep) may lead to impairments in accurate judgment 
of human facial emotions, less expressiveness when respond-
ing to positive film clips, greater elevations in subjective stress 
and negative mood when completing stressor tasks, and greater 
difficulties encoding positive emotional memories.14–17 Addi-
tionally, within clinical samples, those with primary insomnia 
appear to have greater difficulty perceiving emotional infor-
mation from facial expressions using similar affect recognition 
paradigms.18
Several investigations also suggest that sleep disturbances 
may specifically impact emotion regulation abilities. For in-
stance, Mauss and colleagues19 found that individuals with 
poorer sleep quality demonstrated greater difficulties using re-
appraisal strategies to decrease negative emotions after view-
ing sad (cf. depressogenic) film clips. Another study testing 
the effects of experimentally induced chronic sleep restriction 
found that adolescents in a sleep restriction condition reported 
significantly greater irritability, as well as poorer emotion 
regulation abilities, as compared to healthy controls.20 In the 
same study, reports from parents, who were likely well-posi-
tioned informants of their child’s emotion regulation abilities, 
revealed comparable results.
Results from neurobiological and functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies also support the link 
between sleep and emotional processing/regulation abili-
ties. For instance, an fMRI study conducted by Yoo and 
colleagues21 found that among individuals with sleep de-
privation, the amygdala—the neurobiological epicenter for 
emotional experiences—exhibited an amplified response to 
negative emotional stimuli. Conversely, REM sleep appears 
to de-potentiate negative emotional reactivity towards nega-
tive facial expressions and standardized affective pictures 
with a negative valence.22,23 These findings are consistent 
with earlier, seminal work from Cartwright and colleagues24 
indicating that REM sleep may play an important role in 
mood regulation.
Multiple researchers have interpreted these and similar 
findings as evidence that emotion dysregulation (specifically, 
heightened emotional reactivity and emotion regulation defi-
cits) mediates the relationship between insomnia and depres-
sion risk.4,9–12 Such pathways appear further implicated in 
animal studies demonstrating that chronic sleep restriction 
leads to desensitization of the serotonin (5-HT)1A system,25 
long implicated in mood disorders. In comparison, relatively 
few studies have extended these results among high-risk 
groups while using a gold standard self-report measure of ex-
plicit emotion regulation difficulties.
The Present Study
This cross-sectional study aimed: (1) to investigate the preva-
lence of sleep disturbances, depression symptoms, and emo-
tion regulation difficulties among a large national sample 
of firefighters; and (2) to test emotion regulation difficulties 
as an explanatory link between sleep disturbances (insom-
nia, nightmares) and depression symptoms. Consistent with 
previous work, we hypothesized that (1) greater sleep distur-
bances would be significantly associated with impaired uti-
lization of emotion regulation strategies and, subsequently, 
greater depression symptomatology; and (2) the indirect ef-
fects of greater emotion regulation difficulties would signifi-
cantly account for the relationship between (a) insomnia and 
depression symptoms, controlling for nightmares, as well 
as (b) nightmares and depression symptoms, controlling for 
insomnia.
METHODS
Participants
The sample consisted of 880 current (n = 788) and retired 
(n = 92) firefighters who completed a nationwide, web-based 
survey of firefighter behavioral health. In order to consider 
occupational exposures (e.g., trauma) that may have con-
ferred long-term and chronic risk for the development of 
sleep problems and depression, both current and retired fire-
fighters were included. Participants ranged in age from 18 
to 82 years (mean = 8.95, standard deviation = 11.52), and 
91.4% were male. In terms of self-reported race/ethnicity, 
88.2% identified as Caucasian/White, 6.8% as Native Ameri-
can/Alaska Native, and 4.9% as other. Firefighter rank varied, 
with 45.8% holding a lower rank (Firefighter I, Firefighter 
II, Engineer/Technician/Chauffeur), 32.9% holding a higher 
rank (Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain), 17.9% holding an offi-
cer rank or above (Battalion Chiefs, Assistant Chiefs, Deputy 
Chiefs, Commissioners), and 3.4% reporting another rank. 
Department types also varied, with 41.8% serving in full-
time departments, 27.8% in volunteer departments, 28.4% in 
hybrid full-time/volunteer departments, and 2.0% in military 
or wildland departments.
Measures
Demographics
Participants’ demographic information (age, sex, race/ethnic-
ity) and firefighter characteristics (rank, department type) were 
obtained using a brief self-report questionnaire.
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D)
The CES-D26 is a 20-item self-report measure used to assess 
depression symptom severity in the general population. Par-
ticipants rate the degree to which they have experienced each 
feeling or behavior (e.g., “I thought my life had been a failure”) 
in the past week (0 = Less than 1 day, 1 = 1–2 days, 2 = 3–4 
 237

days, 3 = 5–7 days). Total scores range from 0 to 60, with 
higher scores indicating greater depression symptom severity, 
and scores ≥ 16 indicating clinical significance.26 For the pres-
ent study, the item probing sleep difficulties (i.e., “My sleep 
was restless”) was excluded from analyses; thus, total possible 
scores ranged from 0 to 57. The CES-D shows good internal 
consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity across 
populations.26 Within this study, the CES-D demonstrated high 
internal consistency (α = 0.93).
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)
The DERS27 is a 36-item self-report measure used to assess 
emotion regulation difficulties across 6 distinct but related 
domains: (1) Non-acceptance: non-acceptance of emotional 
responses; (2) Strategies: limited access to effective emotion 
regulation strategies; (3) Impulse: impulse control difficulties; 
(4) Goals: difficulties engaging in goal-directed behavior; (5) 
Clarity: lack of emotional clarity; and (6) Awareness: lack of 
emotional awareness. Respondents rate the extent to which 
each item (e.g., “When I’m upset, I feel out of control”) applies 
to themselves, with possible responses being: 1 = Almost never 
(0% to 10%), 2 = Sometimes (11% to 35%), 3 = About half the 
time (36% to 65%), 4 = Most of the time (66% to 90%), and 
5 = Almost always (91% to 100%). Items are summed to create 
a total score as well as subscale scores, with higher scores in-
dicating greater difficulties in the corresponding specific area. 
The DERS total score and subscale scores have been shown to 
have high internal consistency, good test-retest reliability, and 
adequate construct and predictive validity within nonclinical 
populations.27 In the present study, internal consistency was 
high for the DERS total score (α = 0.96) and ranged from good 
to high across the 6 subscales (α = 0.83–0.93).
Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)
The ISI28 is a 7-item self-report questionnaire that measures 
severity of insomnia symptoms (e.g., difficulties falling asleep, 
difficulties staying asleep). Total scores range from 0 to 28, 
with higher scores indicating greater symptom severity and 
scores ≥ 10 indicating clinical significance.29 The ISI shows 
good internal consistency and construct validity across sam-
ples29 and demonstrated high internal consistency with the cur-
rent study (α = 0.91).
PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (PCL-C)
The PCL-C30 is a 17-item self-report measure that assesses se-
verity of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in 
civilian community populations. The PCL-C has been shown 
to have strong psychometric properties.31 For the present study, 
a single item (Item 2) was used to assess nightmare severity, 
with participants asked to rate the extent to which they had 
been bothered by “Repeated, disturbing dreams of a stress-
ful experience from the past” in the past month (1 = Not at 
all, 5 = Extremely). Previous studies have similarly used this 
single item as a measure of nightmare severity.32,33
Procedures
This cross-sectional study represents a subset of a larger in-
vestigation of behavioral health among current and retired 
firefighters (n = 1,027).34 Participants who completed all rel-
evant study measures were included in analyses for the present 
study (n = 880). Individuals were invited to participate in this 
study through listserv and social media announcements (a brief 
description of study and web link to survey portal) posted by 
the National Fallen Firefighters Foundation and other national 
and local firefighter organizations in February 2015. Probability 
sampling was not utilized and response rates were indetermin-
able; thus, the present sample was a convenience sample. Those 
interested in participating reviewed a web-based informed 
consent form and were required to answer correctly a series 
of comprehension questions based on the form. Individuals 
who consented to participating completed a 30-min battery of 
self-report measures through Qualtrics, a secure web-based 
survey platform. Following this, participants had the option to 
provide their email address to receive a $10 electronic gift card 
as compensation. All survey respondents were presented with 
a debriefing form at the end of the survey, which included in-
formation for national resources, such as the National Suicide 
Prevention Lifeline (1-800-273-TALK). The university’s insti-
tutional review board approved all study procedures.
Analytic Plan
Bootstrapped mediation analyses35 were conducted in order 
to test study hypotheses that the indirect effects of emotion 
regulation difficulties would significantly account for the re-
lationship between (1) insomnia and depression symptoms, 
controlling for nightmare severity; and (2) nightmares and 
depression symptoms, controlling for insomnia severity. Con-
trol variables (insomnia or nightmare severity) were included 
to probe the specific effect of each type of sleep disturbance. 
First, only the DERS total score was included as a mediator 
variable. Then, additional indirect effects analyses were con-
ducted to determine the parallel contributions of each of the 
DERS subscales. Pairwise contrasts were conducted to deter-
mine which statistically significant indirect path demonstrated 
the strongest indirect effect on depression symptoms.
Finally, in order to assess for the specificity of indirect ef-
fects, exploratory analyses were implemented to test whether 
overall emotion regulation difficulties and the DERS subscales 
in parallel would significantly account for the relationship be-
tween (1) depression and insomnia symptoms; and (2) depres-
sion and nightmare severity. Exploratory analyses were also 
conducted to examine whether the indirect effects of depres-
sion symptoms would significantly account for the relation-
ship between insomnia symptoms and emotion regulation 
difficulties.
All analyses were conducted using Preacher and Hayes’ 
bias-corrected bootstrapping method35 to test for indirect ef-
fects (5,000 bootstrapped resamples generated from observed 
data); a 95% confidence interval (CI) that did not cross zero 
was considered statistically significant. This statistical ap-
proach was selected in light of recent literature identifying 
bootstrapping as a robust alternative to historically utilized 
tests of mediation (e.g., Sobel test) that tend to be underpow-
ered and that may yield underestimated mediated effects.36 As 
noted, to reduce the plausibility of artificial multicollinearity, 
the CES-D’s single sleep item was removed from analyses.

RESULTS
Descriptive Statistics
Means, standard deviations, ranges, and zero-order Pearson 
r correlations for all self-report measures and DERS sub-
scales are presented in Table 1. Both skew and kurtosis were 
in acceptable ranges for each measure and DERS subscale 
(between ± 2 and ± 1, respectively). A large portion of the 
sample reported clinically significant depression symptoms 
(39.6%) and insomnia symptoms (52.7%), and 44.8% reported 
at least some difficulties with PCL-C-assessed disturbing 
dreams, with 19.2% reporting moderate to extreme prob-
lems with nightmares. There were no statistically significant 
differences between current and retired firefighters’ scores 
on the ISI (F1,877 = 0.034, p = 0.854), CES-D (F1,877 = 0.497, 
p = 0.481), PLC-C sleep item (F1,877 = 2.774, p = 0.096), or 
DERS (F1,877 = 0.654, p = 0.419).
Primary Analyses
Insomnia Severity: Effects on Depression Symptoms
Figure 1 presents the path coefficients from the bootstrapped 
regression and mediation analyses for the effects of ISI insom-
nia severity on CES-D depression symptoms through DERS 
overall emotion regulation difficulties (Figure 1A) and the 6 
DERS subscales (Figure 1B).
For analyses examining the relationship between insomnia 
and depression symptoms, controlling for nightmare severity, 
the overall regression model explained a significant portion of 
the variance in depression symptoms (R2 = 0.69, F3,876 = 649.53, 
p < 0.001). ISI severity significantly predicted overall DERS 
scores (B = 1.84, SE = 0.12, p < 0.001), and overall DERS scores 
significantly predicted CES-D total scores (B = 0.26, SE = 0.01, 
p < 0.001). The direct effects of ISI scores on CES-D scores 
were also significant (B = 0.39, SE = 0.04. p < 0.001). The 
indirect effect of the DERS on CES-D scores was estimated to 
be between 0.385 and 0.566 (95% CI), indicating significance.
Consistent with primary mediation analyses, the DERS 
subscales were found to explain significant variance in the 
association between ISI scores and CES-D scores, control-
ling for nightmares. In particular, the indirect effects of the 
DERS-Strategies (95% CI: 0.255, 0.424) and DERS-Clarity 
(95% CI: 0.045, 0.155) subscales on the relationship between 
ISI and CES-D scores were significant. The indirect effects 
of the other DERS subscales were not significant. Pairwise 
contrasts revealed that the indirect effects of DERS-Strategies 
were significantly stronger than those of DERS-Clarity (95% 
CI: 0.136, 0.335).
Nightmare Severity: Effects on Depression Symptoms
Path coefficients from the bootstrapped regression and me-
diation analyses for the effects of PCL-C nightmare severity 
on depression symptoms through overall DERS scores and 
the 6 DERS subscales are presented in Figures 2A and 2B, 
respectively.
The overall regression model investigating the relationship 
between nightmares and depression symptoms, controlling for 
insomnia severity, accounted for a significant portion of the 
variance in depression symptoms (R2 = 0.69, F3,876 = 649.53, 
p < 0.001). PCL-C Item 2 scores significantly predicted over-
all DERS scores (B = 7.38, SE = 0.75, p < 0.001), and overall 
DERS scores significantly predicted CES-D severity (B = 0.26, 
SE = 0.01, p < 0.001). The direct effects of PCL-C Item 2 
on CES-D scores were also significant (B = 1.56, SE = 0.26, 
p < 0.001). The 95% CI for the indirect effect of the DERS 
was 1.445 to 2.365, suggesting that the observed indirect ef-
fects were significant.
Similarly, the DERS subscales significantly accounted 
for the association between PCL-C Item 2 and CES-D total 
scores, controlling for ISI severity. Again, only the indirect

DERS-Clarity (95% CI: 0.204, 0.701) subscales on the relation-

from pairwise contrasts indicated that the indirect effects of 
DERS-Strategies were significantly stronger than those of 
DERS-Clarity (95% CI: 0.887, 1.931).
Exploratory Analyses
Depression Symptoms: Effects on Insomnia Severity
Path coefficients from the bootstrapped regression and me-
diation analyses examining the association between CES-D 
depression and ISI insomnia, through overall DERS scores 
(Figure 3A) and the 6 DERS subscales (Figure 3B), control-
ling for PCL-C nightmares, are presented in Figure 3.
The overall regression model examining the relationship 
between depression and insomnia symptoms explained a sig-
nificant portion of the variance in insomnia symptom severity 
(R2 = 0.46, F2,877 = 367.32, p < 0.001). CES-D scores signif-
icantly predicted overall DERS scores (B = 1.81, SE = 0.05, 
p < 0.001), and overall DERS scores significantly predicted ISI 
severity (B = 0.06, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001). The direct effects 
of CES-D scores on ISI scores were significant (B = 0.26, 
SE = 0.02, p < 0.001). The indirect effects of the overall DERS 
were also significant (95% CI: 0.077, 0.160).
In examining the parallel contributions of each of the DERS 
subscales, the indirect effects of the DERS-Non-acceptance 
(95% CI: 0.002, 0.053), DERS-Goals (95% CI: 0.029, 0.085), 
DERS-Awareness (95% CI: 0.008, 0.035), and DERS-Strat-
egies (95% CI: −0.110, −0.002) subscales were significant. 
Pairwise contrasts did not identify any particular subscale as 
having the significantly strongest indirect effects.
Depression Symptoms: Effects on Nightmare Severity
Figure 4 presents path coefficients from the bootstrapped 
regression and mediation analyses evaluating the association 
between CES-D depression and PCL-C nightmares through 
overall DERS scores (Figure 4A) and the DERS subscales 
(Figure 4B).
For analyses examining the association between depres-
sion symptoms and nightmare severity, the overall regres-
sion model explained a significant portion of the variance in

nightmare severity (R2 = 0.35, F2,877 = 253.79, p < 0.001). CES-
D scores significantly predicted overall DERS scores (B = 1.81, 
SE = 0.05, p < 0.001), and overall DERS scores predicted PCL-
C Item 2 severity (B = 0.01, SE = 0.001, p < 0.001). The di-
rect effects of CES-D scores on ISI severity were significant 
(B = 0.04, SE = 0.004, p < 0.001). The indirect effects of the 
DERS on PCL-C nightmare severity were also significant 
(95% CI: 0.010, 0.024).
Multiple mediation analyses revealed significant indirect 
effects for the following DERS subscales on nightmare sever-
ity: DERS-Non-acceptance (95% CI: 0.001, 0.013), DERS-
Goals (95% CI: −0.011, −0.001), DERS-Impulse (95% CI: 
0.002, 0.017), DERS-Awareness (95% CI: −0.006, −0.001), and 
DERS-Clarity (95% CI: 0.002, 0.016). That is, significant in-
direct effects emerged for each subscale, with the exception of 
DERS-Strategies. Pairwise contrasts did not identify any one 
subscale as having the significantly strongest indirect effects.

through the CES-D, controlling for PCL-C nightmares, are 
presented in Figure 5.
The overall regression model accounted for a significant por-
tion of the variance in DERS scores (R2 = 0.62, F3,876 = 550.22, 
p < 0.001). ISI severity significantly predicted CES-D scores 
(B = 0.86, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001), and CES-D scores significantly 
predicted overall DERS scores (B = 1.48, SE = 0.06, p < 0.001). 
The direct effects of ISI scores on the DERS (B = 0.56, SE = 0.11, 
p < 0.001) were significant. The indirect effects of the CES-D 
were also significant (95% CI: 1.099, 1.469).
DISCUSSION
This study aimed: (1) to investigate rates of sleep disturbances, 
depression symptoms, and emotion regulation difficulties, and 
(2) to examine emotion dysregulation as an explanatory factor 
in the relationship between sleep disturbances (insomnia, night-
mares) and depression in a large sample of current and retired 
firefighters. Findings have a number of implications for future 
research investigating the link between sleep disturbances and

depression, as well as clinical applications for the prevention 
and treatment of depression among firefighters.
First, results revealed high rates of sleep disturbances and 
depression symptoms among participants, each of which dem-
onstrated a strong association with emotion regulation dif-
ficulties. This supports our study hypothesis and replicates 
past work identifying firefighters as being at elevated risk for 
sleep and depressive disorders.1–3 These results also indicate 
that these problems co-occur at high rates among those with a 
fire service history; thus, it may be advantageous to assess for 
and, if necessary, treat both sleep and depression complaints 
among current and retired firefighters. Additionally, these el-
evated rates of sleep and depression problems emphasize the 
critical need to further study the pathogenesis of risk for these 
psychiatric disorders in this largely understudied, yet evidently 
high-risk, population. The present study represents one of few 
large-scale studies examining the nature of psychiatric prob-
lems among individuals in the fire service. Research in this 
area is particularly important given the occupational hazards 
experienced by firefighters and the potential to extend findings 
to similar populations (e.g., emergency medical technicians, 
paramedics, law enforcement officers, and other first responder 
groups).
Second, findings supported our hypothesis that emotion 
regulation difficulties would account for the relationship be-
tween sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares) and depres-
sion symptoms. By highlighting emotion dysregulation as an 
explanatory link in the robust relationship between sleep dis-
turbances and depression, this study builds upon past research 
demonstrating that experimentally induced sleep deprivation 
and subjective sleep complaints may negatively affect use 
of emotion reappraisal strategies,19 processing of emotional 
stimuli and negative emotions,14,15,24 and effective endurance of 
stressful situations.16
That the ability to access and successfully employ emo-
tion 
regulation 
strategies 
(DERS-Strategies) 
emerged 
as the strongest indirect effect in the relationship be-
tween sleep disturbances and depression warrants discus-
sion. This finding aligns with previous studies indicating 
the poor sleep quality may specifically impact individu-
als’ problem-solving skills and ability to utilize reappraisal 
strategies to decrease negative emotions.19–21 It is also

unsurprising that unresolved negative emotions or hopeless-
ness in the face of unsolvable problems might confer risk for 
depression. Thus, difficulties utilizing emotion regulation 
strategies may represent a specific therapeutic target that 
requires further investigation for the prevention and treatment 
of depression among firefighters suffering from sleep distur-
bances. It is worthwhile to note that difficulties interpreting 
one’s feelings (DERS-Clarity) were also revealed to be a sig-
nificant, albeit weaker, explanatory link in the relationship 
between sleep disturbances and depression. This is consistent 
with previous studies suggesting that sleep deprivation may 
impact one’s ability to interpret emotions14 and perceive emo-
tional information,18 and it identifies another potential thera-
peutic target requiring further investigation. Relatedly, the 
finding that only these two subscales significantly mediated 
the relationship between sleep problems and depression miti-
gates concerns regarding the relatively high correlations be-
tween the DERS and CES-D since this suggests that the DERS 
subscales measured meaningfully distinct constructs in the 
present sample.
Although there is significantly less evidence in the litera-
ture establishing a link between nightmares and depression 
risk, emotion regulation difficulties also emerged as a sig-
nificant mediator of the relationship between nightmares and 
depression, even after controlling for the effects of insomnia. 
This reveals striking similarities in the mechanisms whereby

insomnia and nightmares independently relate to depression, 
yet also emphasizes the potential utility and value of separately 
assessing nightmare problems even after insomnia symptoms 
have been probed. Moreover, this finding expands what is 
known about the effects of nightmares on mental health, in-
cluding, most relevantly, emerging literature on the role of 
nightmares in conferring risk for suicide.8
Third, given evidence that the relationship between depres-
sion and insomnia may be bidirectional,37 our exploratory 
finding that depression is related to insomnia via deficits in 
emotion regulation is not surprising. However, only the in-
direct effects of the DERS-Awareness and DERS-Goals 
subscales were significant for this path, suggesting that de-
pression may impact one’s abilities to acknowledge aversive 
emotional states and enact goal-directed activities in light of 
negative emotions, subsequently affecting one’s sleep qual-
ity. This contrasts with our other study findings identifying 
DERS-Strategies as the strongest indirect effect in the as-
sociation between insomnia and depression. Interestingly, 
this suggests that depression and insomnia may affect one 
another through distinct emotion regulation pathways. This 
is understandable given that while depression and insomnia 
commonly co-occur, they are also both primary psychiatric 
disorders with distinct diagnostic criteria. Taken together, 
these data provide additional evidence for the relevance and 
value of targeting deficits in emotion regulation in the preven-
tion and treatment of both insomnia and depression, although 
different therapeutic targets may be indicated depending on 
individuals’ presenting problems.
Results from the exploratory analyses additionally indi-
cated that depression might play an explanatory role in the 
relationship between insomnia and emotion regulation diffi-
culties. This finding is consistent both with cognitive theories 
of depression, which suggest that individuals with depression 
may have greater negative attention biases,38 and with the no-
tion that other explanatory pathways between insomnia and 
depression exist.9 These results further confirm the highly in-
terrelated nature of sleep disturbances, depression symptoms, 
and emotion dysregulation, particularly in the context of the 
fire service.
Finally, as previously alluded to, findings from this study 
have clinical applications based on the identification of emo-
tion regulation difficulties as a potential therapeutic target 
for prevention of depression among individuals, especially 
firefighters, with sleep disturbances. Although efficacious 
interventions exist to treat insomnia, such as cognitive be-
havioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I),39 this study’s results 
indicate that supplementation of CBT-I with modules from a 
therapy focused on addressing emotion dysregulation (e.g., 
dialectical behavior therapy [DBT], which enhances knowl-
edge and effective utilization of emotion regulation skills) 
may bolster efforts to thwart the trajectory from insomnia 
to depression. This approach is supported by previous stud-
ies highlighting the strong interplay between sleep, emotion, 
and mood.20,24 Further work, however, is needed to establish 
whether DBT or similar treatments may serve as an effective 
adjunct to CBT-I, as conclusions regarding this therapeutic 
approach cannot be drawn from this study’s findings. Even 
so, these results provide evidence for a possible mechanism 
by which insomnia-focused treatments have been able to 
successfully reduce depression symptoms40—through the 
enhancement of an individual’s ability to utilize emotion 
regulation strategies.
Limitations and Future Directions
Limitations of the current study should also be noted. First, 
the cross-sectional study design precludes causal inferences. 
A prospective study would allow for delineation of the tem-
poral relationships between these constructs and investiga-
tion of the acute and chronic effects of occupational exposure 
(this study assumed chronic effects by including retired fire-
fighters). Second, our study utilized a convenience sample of 
firefighters recruited via web-based announcements, which 
potentially biased results. Firefighters with greater techno-
logical literacy, more severe symptoms (and consequently, 
potentially greater interest in completing a behavioral health 
survey), and lower functioning (e.g., having more available 
time) may have been more likely to complete the survey, lim-
iting generalizability. Even though the large sample and high 
rate of self-reported sleep disturbances afforded us ample 
variability to detect even small effects, future studies may 
benefit from use of a representative sampling strategy. None-
theless, Stanley et al.34 reported that the sociodemographic 
and occupational characteristics of study respondents closely 
paralleled those of the U.S. fire service, attenuating concerns 
regarding representativeness. Third, use of a validated self-
report measure of nightmares (e.g., Disturbing Dreams and 
Nightmare Severity Index) or an updated measure of depres-
sion symptoms excluding less relevant items (e.g., Hopkins 
Revised CES-D) would have strengthened analyses. Finally, 
parameters for the associations observed between sleep dis-
turbances and DERS subscales (e.g., see Figure 4) may in-
dicate that, in some cases, significant associations may have 
arisen as a result of the large sample size and ability to detect 
small and potentially trivial effects. Thus, further work is 
needed to evaluate these relationships, particularly by utiliz-
ing objective measures of emotion regulation (e.g., reaction 
time-based tasks) and sleep quality (e.g., polysomnography 
[PSG], electroencephalogram [EEG], actigraphy), as well as 
clinician-derived depression diagnoses, rather than relying 
solely on self-report data.
CONCLUSIONS
Past research has demonstrated that sleep disturbances are a 
strong predictor of depression onset, and it has been posited 
that emotion dysregulation might play a critical role in this 
relationship. Findings from this study of current and retired 
firefighters extend and integrate previous literature by dem-
onstrating that difficulties with emotion regulation, specifi-
cally limited access to emotion regulation strategies, may be 
an explanatory factor in the link between subjective sleep dis-
turbances and depression symptoms. Future research is recom-
mended to replicate this finding across clinical samples while 
leveraging additional methodological approaches.
