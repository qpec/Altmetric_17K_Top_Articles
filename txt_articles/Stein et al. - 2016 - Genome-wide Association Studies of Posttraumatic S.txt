IMPORTANCE Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent, serious public health
concern, particularly in the military. The identification of genetic risk factors for PTSD may
provide important insights into the biological foundation of vulnerability and comorbidity.
OBJECTIVE To discover genetic loci associated with the lifetime risk for PTSD in 2 cohorts
from the Army Study to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army STARRS).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two coordinated genome-wide association studies of
mental health in the US military contributed participants. The New Soldier Study (NSS)
included 3167 unique participants with PTSD and 4607 trauma-exposed control individuals;
the Pre/Post Deployment Study (PPDS) included 947 unique participants with PTSD and
4969 trauma-exposed controls. The NSS data were collected from February 1, 2011, to
November 30, 2012; the PDDS data, from January 9 to April 30, 2012. The primary analysis
compared lifetime DSM-IV PTSD cases with trauma-exposed controls without lifetime PTSD.
Data were analyzed from March 18 to December 27, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Association analyses for PTSD used logistic regression
models within each of 3 ancestral groups (European, African, and Latino American) by study,
followed by meta-analysis. Heritability and genetic correlation and pleiotropy with other
psychiatric and immune-related disorders were estimated.
RESULTS The NSS population was 80.7% male (6277 of 7774 participants; mean [SD] age,
20.9 [3.3] years); the PPDS population, 94.4% male (5583 of 5916 participants; mean [SD]
age, 26.5 [6.0] years). A genome-wide significant locus was found in ANKRD55 on
chromosome 5 (rs159572; odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% CI, 1.37-1.92; P = 2.34 × 10−8) and
persisted after adjustment for cumulative trauma exposure (adjusted OR, 1.64; 95% CI,
1.39-1.95; P = 1.18 × 10−8) in the African American samples from the NSS. A genome-wide
significant locus was also found in or near ZNF626 on chromosome 19 (rs11085374; OR, 0.77;
95% CI, 0.70-0.85; P = 4.59 × 10−8) in the European American samples from the NSS. Similar
results were not found for either single-nucleotide polymorphism in the corresponding
ancestry group from the PPDS sample, in other ancestral groups, or in transancestral meta-
analyses. Single-nucleotide polymorphism–based heritability was nonsignificant, and no
significant genetic correlations were observed between PTSD and 6 mental disorders or 9
immune-related disorders. Significant evidence of pleiotropy was observed between PTSD
and rheumatoid arthritis and, to a lesser extent, psoriasis.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In the largest genome-wide association study of PTSD to
date, involving a US military sample, limited evidence of association for specific loci was
found. Further efforts are needed to replicate the genome-wide significant association with
ANKRD55—associated in prior research with several autoimmune and inflammatory
disorders—and to clarify the nature of the genetic overlap observed between PTSD and
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.

P
osttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common con-
sequence of exposure to extreme, life-threatening
events.1,2 Posttraumatic stress disorder is also fre-
quently associated with other mental health problems such
as major depressive disorder,3 substance abuse,4 and
suicidality5,6; with other adverse health sequelae such as
obesity,7 cardiovascular disease,8-10 and type 2 diabetes
mellitus11,12; and with immune-related disorders, such as
rheumatoid arthritis.13
Although most Americans (50%-85%) experience trau-
matic events during their lifetime, the lifetime prevalence of
PTSD is approximately 7%,14 suggesting differential vulner-
ability to the disorder. Rates of trauma exposure and PTSD are
higher among US military personnel and veterans,15 particu-
larly those exposed to combat.16,17 Much of the research on the
risk for PTSD has focused on the differential impact of type,18
frequency, duration, and consequences (eg, extent of physi-
cal injury) of trauma exposures.19 Pretrauma risk factors, in-
cluding personality characteristics and early life experiences,
have also been scrutinized extensively,18,20,21 as have post-
trauma factors, such as social support.22
Twin studies have long established that genetic variation
contributes to risk for PTSD symptoms, with heritability esti-
mates in the range of 0.28 to 0.46.23-26 Genetic association
studies have focused on a limited set of candidate genes and
have been largely underpowered to detect loci of modest
effect.27 More recently, several genome-wide association stud-
ies(GWAS)ofPTSDhavebeenreportedincivilian28,29andmili-
taryorveteran30-33samples,yieldingseveralgenome-widesig-
nificant associations that have yet to be widely replicated.
The present investigation uses data from the Army Study
to Assess Risk and Resilience in Servicemembers (Army
STARRS),34 a large, coordinated set of study components in-
tended to improve understanding of suicide, PTSD, and re-
lated mental health risk and resilience in the US Army. Blood
samples for DNA were provided by participants in the follow-
ing2componentsofArmySTARRS:astudyofnewsoldiersdur-
ing their first week of basic training (New Soldier Study [NSS]),
and a study of 3 brigade combat teams before their deploy-
menttoAfghanistan(Pre/PostDeploymentStudy[PPDS]).Each
of these studies has, to our knowledge, a larger PTSD-
affected sample than any previously published genetic study
of PTSD. We report herein results from within-ancestral-
group and within-study genome-wide analyses, followed by
meta-analyses across studies.
Methods
Participants
Detailed information about the design and conduct of Army
STARRS is available in a separate report34 and in the eMethods
in the Supplement. The recruitment, consent, human partici-
pant, and data protection procedures were approved by the
Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, Har-
vard University, University of Michigan, and University of Cali-
fornia,SanDiego.Writteninformedconsentwasobtainedfrom
all participants.
New Soldier Study
TheNSSwasperformedamongnewsoldiersatthestartoftheir
basic training at 1 of 3 army installations from February 1, 2011,
to November 30, 2012. Of 39 784 NSS participants who com-
pleted the computerized, self-administered questionnaire,
33 088 (83.2%) provided blood samples. Genotyping was con-
ducted on samples from the first half of the cohort, from which
7999 samples were selected based on phenotype and case-
control status (NSS1). When the remaining half of the cohort
collection was completed, we selected an informative subset
of 2835 samples for genotyping (NSS2) (eMethods in the
Supplement).
Pre/Post Deployment Survey
The PPDS is a multiple-wave panel survey that collected base-
line data (time 0) from US Army soldiers in 3 brigade combat
teams from January 9 to April 30, 2012, within approxi-
mately 6 weeks of their deployment to Afghanistan. Seven
thousand nine hundred twenty-seven PPDS soldiers with eli-
gible self-administered questionnaire responses underwent
genotyping for the GWAS.
Demographics and Case-Control Status
The population, sex, and age composition of our analyzed
sample of cases and controls is shown in Table 1. Most of the
participants were male, and we analyzed male and female par-
ticipants together. A total of 3167 unique PTSD cases and 4607
trauma-exposed controls from NSS1 and NSS2 as well as 947
unique PTSD cases and 4969 trauma-exposed controls from
PPDS entered the statistical analysis.
Measures
The self-administered questionnaire included a computer-
ized version of the Composite International Diagnostic Inter-
view Screening Scales35 and a screening version of the PTSD
Checklist (PCL) (range, 17-85, with higher scores indicating
worse symptoms).36 Trauma exposure was assessed from an-
swers pertaining to childhood, adulthood civilian, and, for
PPDS participants, military traumatic events (eMethods in the
Supplement). A diagnosis of PTSD was assigned using mul-
tiple imputation methods that relied on the PCL and Compos-
ite International Diagnostic Interview Screening Scales data;
our clinical reappraisal study found satisfactory concordance
with independent clinical diagnoses based on blinded Struc-
Key Points
Question Are genome-wide significant risk loci associated with
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a US military sample?
Finding In a genome-wide association study, 2 genome-wide
significant loci were associated with PTSD in a cohort of new
soldiers, but these findings were not replicated in a separate
sample of soldiers. We also found significant evidence of genetic
pleiotropy between PTSD and rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis.
Meaning These findings should encourage further study of the
association of the risk for immune-related disorders and PTSD.

DNA Collection and Genotyping
Whole-blood samples were shipped to Rutgers University Cell
and DNA Repository, where they were frozen for later DNA ex-
traction using standard methods. The NSS1 and PPDS samples
underwent genotyping using the OmniExpress and Exome ar-
ray (Illumina) with additional custom content. The NSS2
samples were genotyped on the PsychChip array (Illumina)
(eMethods in the Supplement). Imputation, population as-
signment, and principal component analysis are described in
the eMethods and eFigures 1 to 5 in the Supplement.
Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed from March 18 to December 27, 2015. Life-
time PTSD cases and controls (ie, individuals without life-
time PTSD) reporting at least 1 traumatic event were included
in the association analyses. We used PLINK (version 1.9)38 to
perform association tests on imputed single-nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) dosage with logistic regression adjusted for
thetop10within-populationprincipalcomponents.Themeta-
analysis of NSS1 and NSS2 is the primary analysis. The analy-
sis of the PPDS sample is our internal attempt at replication
analysis. We sought external replication with other pub-
lished military-relevant data sets (described in the Results sec-
tion below).

tiple phenotypes, which considers causal variants with the
same and opposite effects) of PTSD in all European American
sampleswithpsychiatricdisorders(includingschizophrenia,40

Results
Genome-wide Association Analyses
The NSS population was 80.7% male (6277 of 7774 partici-
pants; mean [SD] age, 20.9 [3.3] years); the PPDS population,
94.4% male (5583 of 5916 participants; mean [SD] age, 26.5
[6.0] years). The λGC and the QQ plot showed negligible infla-
tion of association P values in the NSS (meta-analysis of NSS1
and NSS2) and PPDS samples (eFigure 6 in the Supplement).
An SNP on chromosome 19 was significantly associated with
PTSD in the NSS results in European American samples
(rs11085374; odds ratio [OR], 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.85;
P = 4.59 × 10−8). A SNP on chromosome 5 was significantly as-
sociated with PTSD in the NSS results in African American
samples (rs159572; OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.37-1.92; P = 2.34 × 10−8)
and persisted after adjustment for cumulative trauma expo-
sure (adjusted OR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.39-1.95; P = 1.18 × 10−8). We
did not find similar results for either SNP in the correspond-
ing ancestry groups from the PPDS sample. The individual
study and meta-analysis results are presented in Table 2, and
the Manhattan plots in NSS African American and European
American samples are shown in Figure 1. We further created

regional plots58 for 300-kilobase regions around the 2 most
significant (top-hit) SNPs (eFigure 7 in the Supplement). No
significant associations were observed in the Latino NSS or
PPDS samples or in any of the transethnic meta-analyses.
Adjustment for lifetime trauma exposure slightly strength-
ened the genome-wide significant associations for the 2 lead
SNPs (eTable 1 in the Supplement), whereas simultaneous
adjustment for lifetime trauma exposure, sex, and age
slightly attenuated the associations (eTable 2 and eFigure 8
in the Supplement).
The top SNP, rs159572 (eFigure 7A in the Supplement), on
chromosome5isintronictotheankyrinrepeatdomain55gene
(ANKRD55[NCBIEntrezGene79722]),andmultipleotherSNPs
in this region were in LD with this SNP. ANKRD55 has been as-
sociated with several autoimmune diseases, including mul-
tiple sclerosis,59,60 type 2 diabetes mellitus,61 celiac disease,62
and rheumatoid arthritis.63 The top SNP, rs11085374, on chro-
mosome 19 is located near the zinc finger protein 626 gene
(ZNF626 [NCBI Entrez Gene 199777]). We found minimal LD
between this SNP and surrounding SNPs (eFigure 7B in the
Supplement), and no other SNPs in the region showed evi-
dence of association.
Meta-analysis With Other Military Data Sets
We performed a meta-analysis of the results for SNP rs159572
on chromosome 5 between 3 GWAS of African American mili-
tary samples, including data reported herein from Army
STARRS (the current analysis), the Marine Resiliency Study,31
and a recently published genetic study of Iraq-Afghanistan US
veterans32 (Figure 2). The results were directionally consis-
tent in the Army STARRS NSS and PPDS samples as well as the
MarineResiliencyStudybutnotinthePTSDveteranGWAS(OR
for meta-analysis, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31).
Alternate Phenotypic Characterization
To examine the robustness of our findings, we tested for as-
sociation of the top 2 SNPs at the chromosome 19 and 5 loci
with an alternate phenotypic characterization of PTSD; all par-

nificant genetic correlations were found in the same data sets
(eTable 4 in the Supplement).
To further characterize the observed pleiotropy, we per-
formed an enrichment analysis of SNPs with pleiotropy pos-
terior probability of greater than 0.5. For pleiotropy for PTSD
and rheumatoid arthritis, we observed several significant en-
richments for medical subject headings for tissue and cell type
annotations (eTable 5 in the Supplement) and gene ontology
terms (eTable 6 in the Supplement) related to several im-
mune systems and functions. No enrichment was present for
pleiotropy for PTSD and psoriasis. Finally, we estimated that
the probability for an SNP associated with PTSD to be a cen-
tral nervous system SNP is 2.28 (SE, 0.24) times the probabil-
ity for an SNP not associated with PTSD to be a central ner-
vous system SNP. Similarly, the enrichment ratio for immune-
related expression quantitative trait loci in PTSD is 2.36 (SE,
0.27).
Discussion
This study is, to our knowledge, the largest GWAS of PTSD con-
ducted to date. Because the study is reflective of the US Army,
the composition of the samples was ethnically diverse, obli-
gating us to conduct initial association analyses within ances-
tral groups and then to attempt transancestral meta-
analyses.Wefoundnogenome-widesignificantlociatthelevel
of the transancestral meta-analyses but found 2 genome-
wide significant loci, one each in the African American and Eu-
ropean American samples from the NSS.
IntheAfricanAmericanNSSsample,weobservedgenome-
wide significant association with PTSD for SNPs on chromo-
some 5 in ANKRD55. Inclusion of data from African American
participantsfromadditionalmilitarycohortscontinuedtoyield
a significant result of the meta-analysis at this locus, albeit at-
tenuated compared with that of the NSS alone (Figure 2). This
gene, whose function is currently unknown, has been re-
ported to be associated with a range of autoimmune and in-
flammatory disorders, including multiple sclerosis,59,60 type
2 diabetes mellitus,61 celiac disease,62 and rheumatoid
arthritis.63
We also found evidence of significant pleiotropy be-
tween PTSD and 2 immune-related disorders, namely, rheu-
matoid arthritis and, to a lesser extent, psoriasis. We may have
seen this genetic overlap in European American participants
(whereas the ANKRD55 association finding was in African
American individuals) because human populations can pre-
sent ancestry-specific risk alleles in the context of similar un-
derlying biological mechanisms of disease predisposition.66
These novel findings are consistent with recent reports of plei-
otropy between other mental disorders, such as schizophre-
nia, and immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and
multiple sclerosis.67,68 In the context of new evidence that
schizophrenia involves allelic variation in the major histocom-
patibility complex, these observations suggest that intensive
scrutiny of immune factors, and perhaps in particular of
complement component 4,69 should be the subject of further
study in other mental disorders, such as PTSD.
A hypothetical immune-related or inflammatory cause of
PTSD has, in fact, gained some empirical support.70 Two re-
cent studies have found elevated levels of the inflammatory
biomarker C-reactive protein in individuals at risk for PTSD71
or with PTSD.72 Other studies have found abnormal cytokine
regulation73 or other evidence of a proinflammatory milieu74
in PTSD. Posttraumatic stress disorder is itself highly comor-
bid with several of the disorders associated with ANKRD55, in-
cluding type 2 diabetes mellitus12,75 and rheumatoid
arthritis.76,77 Moreover, a recent epidemiologic study of Iraq
and Afghanistan military veterans found PTSD to be associ-
ated with a broad range of autoimmune disorders, including
inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and mul-
tiple sclerosis.13 Further research is needed to determine
whether variation in ANKRD55—or other genes contributing
to the observed pleiotropy—accounts for these associations.
Why the association of ANKRD55 with PTSD is apparently re-
stricted to African American individuals should also be deter-
mined, although this restriction may be explained by differ-
ing LD block structure and increased minor allele frequency.
We also detected in the European American NSS samples
1 genome-wide significant SNP on chromosome 19 near
ZNF626,agenethoughttobeinvolvedintheregulationofRNA
transcription. The regional plot showed no other associated
SNPs in LD with this result. This finding may represent a spu-
rious association, but it also may reflect a lack of nearby vari-
ants in LD with the index SNP, which requires further study.
Genome-wide significant results from the NSS were not
replicated in the PPDS. The PPDS sample was smaller and dis-
tinct in important ways from the NSS sample. Participants in
the NSS were younger (mostly 18-20 years of age), and their
trauma exposure and resultant PTSD were entirely premili-
tary.Incontrast,PPDSparticipantswereolder,theirmeannon-
military trauma exposure was higher than in the NSS (reflect-

ing the accrual of traumatic exposures over time), and many
participants had additionally experienced deployment-
related traumas. This finding of consistent results in identi-
cally ascertained samples (ie, NSS1 and NSS2) but inconsis-
tentresultsinasecondmilitarysamplewithdifferentratesand
types of trauma exposure serves as a reminder of the chal-
lenges this field will face in working across and combining data
sets that include individuals with heterogeneous trauma
experiences.78
In this regard, adjustment for trauma exposure tended to
increase the statistical significance of genome-wide or near–
genome-wide significant SNPs. We know, however, that cer-
taintypesoftraumahavehigherconditionalrisksforPTSDthan
others.15 Therefore, adjustment for trauma based on tallying
exposure to different trauma types—without taking into ac-
count differential conditional risks for PTSD for certain trauma
types—might inadequately model these relationships. Our re-
sults underscore the need for additional work to determine the
appropriate metrics for trauma exposure and the optimal func-
tional forms for modeling these outcomes in genetic data sets.
For example, when these effects should be modeled by cova-
rying for trauma exposure or when interactions—with overall
trauma severity or with specific trauma types—should be con-
sidered remains unclear. Well-powered gene- and environ-
ment-wide interaction studies may be especially illuminat-
ing given observations that the interaction of PTSD
susceptibility genes with early trauma (eg, childhood mal-
treatment) exposure may be paramount.79
The cross-phenotype LD score regression results failed to
provide evidence of genetic correlation between PTSD and the
other mental disorders examined. Previous studies have re-
ported evidence of shared genetic risk between PTSD and bi-
polar disorder.31,80 Clinical and genetic epidemiologic studies
have found considerable comorbidity—at least some of which
is explained by shared genetic vulnerability26,81,82—between
PTSD and major depressive disorder and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder.83,84 Insufficient power is a possible ex-
planation for our study’
s failure to find evidence of a shared ge-
neticriskacrossthesedisorders.However,enrichmentanalysis
suggested that risk variants for PTSD aggregate in many of the
same biological pathways shared with other neuropsychiatric
disorders, notably those involved in immune regulation.85
Our results should be interpreted in light of several addi-
tional limitations. First, samples sizes—especially within an-
cestral groups—are likely to be insufficiently powered to de-
tectlociofmodesteffect.Givenourtotalsamplesize,wewould
have 80% power to detect associations for SNPs with 20% mi-
nor allele frequency with an OR of 1.2 or higher. Second, the
genetic correlation of the risk for trauma exposure with risk
for PTSD is well established.24,86,87 Therefore, although ex-
clusion of control individuals with no trauma exposure should
haveimprovedourpowertodetectPTSDrisklocigiventrauma
exposure, it may have reduced our ability to detect loci that
contribute to PTSD by increasing the risk for trauma. Third, our
finding of no apparent heritability emanating from the GCTA
analyses may be owing to insufficient power. Fourth, the use

tofore unappreciated limitations in this approach may exist.
Conclusions
We found no genome-wide significant evidence that tran-
scended ancestry and replicated across studies. We did, how-
ever, find genome-wide significant evidence of an associa-
tion of ANKRD55, a gene previously associated with
inflammatory and immune disorders, with PTSD in African
American participants. This association was observed in a pre-
military PTSD sample (NSS), not replicated in a mixed premili-
tary and military PTSD sample (PPDS), but showed similar ef-
fectsizeanddirectionalityinanindependentsampleofMarines
withPTSD(MarineResiliencyStudy).31Thisassociationissmall
in magnitude and, even if replicated, would be of no obvious
clinical utility at present. Its value may lie, however, in even-
tual elucidation of the nature of PTSD and its association with
other illnesses. The finding of pleiotropy between PTSD and
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis should further motivate the
study of immune-related factors in PTSD, their potential con-
tribution to comorbidity with inflammatory disorders, and a
possible role for anti-inflammatory treatments in PTSD.88
