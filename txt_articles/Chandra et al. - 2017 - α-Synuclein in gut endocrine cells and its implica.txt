Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor disturbances, 
including resting tremor, rigidity, and slow movements, as well as gastrointestinal symptoms, such as con-
stipation and gastroparesis. The pathological hallmarks of PD are cytoplasmic inclusions known as Lewy 
bodies (within the cell body) and Lewy neurites (in axons) of the brain and enteric nervous system (1). 
These inclusions are associated with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars 
compacta (2, 3), which produces the distinctive disorders of movement and vagal nerve dysfunction. The 
major component of Lewy pathology is aggregated α-synuclein, a synaptic protein with the propensity 
to misfold and aggregate (4). Misfolded α-synuclein plays a critical role in PD pathogenesis, and recent 
evidence supports a model in which propagation of Lewy pathology occurs via cell-to-cell transmission 
of misfolded α-synuclein onto recipient cells (5–9). Misfolded α-synuclein recruits native α-synuclein in 
the recipient cell and acts as a template or nidus for the development of aggregates that eventually lead to 
formation of Lewy bodies and ultimately PD (1, 8, 10).
Although the pathogenesis of PD is incompletely understood, Braak and colleagues suggest that the 
pathological process begins in the enteric nervous system (11, 12). Both clinical and experimental data 
support such a model. Clinically, PD patients frequently experience gastrointestinal symptoms many years 
before motor deficits develop (13, 14), and α-synuclein aggregates appear in enteric nerves before they are 
found in the brain (12, 15, 16). α-Synuclein immunoreactive inclusions have been found in neurons of the 
submucosal plexus, whose axons project to the mucosa (15, 17, 18). Moreover, it has been reported recently 
that bilateral vagotomy reduces the risk of PD (19).
Experimentally, direct transmission of α-synuclein from the gut to the brain was demonstrated in a key 
experiment in which α-synuclein injected into the intestine was transported via the vagus nerve to the dorsal 
motor nucleus of the vagus in the brainstem (20, 21). This finding is consistent with the original observation 
that Lewy pathology appears in the projection neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the early 
stages of PD (12). Experimentally, the vagal route of α-synuclein transport has also been documented following 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with devastating clinical 
manifestations. In PD, neuronal death is associated with intracellular aggregates of the neuronal 
protein α-synuclein known as Lewy bodies. Although the cause of sporadic PD is not well 
understood, abundant clinical and pathological evidence show that misfolded α-synuclein 
is found in enteric nerves before it appears in the brain. This suggests a model in which PD 
pathology originates in the gut and spreads to the central nervous system via cell-to-cell prion-like 
propagation, such that transfer of misfolded α-synuclein initiates misfolding of native α-synuclein 
in recipient cells. We recently discovered that enteroendocrine cells (EECs), which are part of the gut 
epithelium and directly face the gut lumen, also possess many neuron-like properties and connect 
to enteric nerves. In this report, we demonstrate that α-synuclein is expressed in the EEC line, STC-1, 
and native EECs of mouse and human intestine. Furthermore, α-synuclein–containing EECs directly 
connect to α-synuclein–containing nerves, forming a neural circuit between the gut and the nervous 
system in which toxins or other environmental influences in the gut lumen could affect α-synuclein 
folding in the EECs, thereby beginning a process by which misfolded α-synuclein could propagate 
from the gut epithelium to the brain.

exposure to the environmental toxin rotenone (22) as well as following direct injection of adenoassociated viral 
vectors overexpressing human α-synuclein into the vagus nerve (23). A route from intrinsic enteric neurons to the 
vagus nerve is supported by the observation that both myenteric neurons and preganglionic vagal nerves express 
α-synuclein (24). These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that α-synuclein aggregation begins in the gut 
and spreads to the central nervous system via the vagus nerve.
Recently, it has been shown that individuals with PD have an altered gut microbial composition 
(25–28), raising the possibility that gut microbes affect PD pathogenesis. In a mouse model of PD, gut 
microbiota promoted α-synuclein aggregation and the development of motor disturbances (29). Moreover, 
colonization of mice with microbiota from PD-affected individuals enhanced physical deterioration (29), 
further emphasizing the role of the gut in PD. However, the mechanism by which gut microbes affect the 
progression of PD is not well understood.
Furthermore, an environmental basis for PD has been suspected for over 50 years, and a number of 
studies have shown an increased incidence of PD in individuals exposed to pesticides and herbicides 
(30–32). Enteric nerves are limited by the intestinal epithelium and do not extend into the intestinal 
lumen. Therefore, nerves of the gut do not have direct contact with luminal contents. Thus, even though 
data suggest that PD pathology begins in the gut, the mechanism by which luminal environmental toxins 
might induce changes in enteric neurons is unknown (12–16, 20).
Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) are chemosensory cells that are dispersed throughout the mucosal 
lining of the intestine and oriented with their apical surface open to the lumen of the intestine, so that 
they can sense luminal contents, such as ingested nutrients or gut microbes. Traditionally, EECs were 
viewed exclusively as hormone-producing cells of the gastrointestinal tract; however, we recently dis-
covered that EECs also connect to neurons (33, 34). Their location places EECs at the interface between 
gut contents and the nervous system and provides a direct route for substances in the gut to affect neural 
function. In addition, EECs are electrically excitable and possess many neuronal features, including

neurotrophin receptors, presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, small clear secretory vesicles, neurofila-
ments, and basal processes known as neuropods (35). A functional synaptic connection between EECs 
and enteric nerves was established using rabies viral tracing, in which a modified rabies virus placed 
into the lumen of the intestine infected EECs and was transmitted into enteric nerves (33). These neu-
ronal features suggest that EECs are sensory cells in the gut. Impressed by their neuron-like properties, 
we sought to determine if EECs express α-synuclein. If they do, their location at the interface of the 
gut lumen and the nervous system suggests that EECs could be a target for the induction of abnormal 
α-synuclein and initiation of the prion-like cascade leading to PD.
Results
α-Synuclein is expressed in enteroendocrine STC-1 cells. STC-1 cells were derived from the duodenum of trans-
genic mice that expressed SV40 large T antigen downstream from a rat insulin promoter (36); they are 
widely accepted as a model of native EECs (37). STC-1 cells express several gastrointestinal hormones, 
such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and peptide YY (PYY), whose secretion is regulated in a manner similar 
to native EECs (38–40). The inability to culture EECs or obtain sufficient numbers from intestinal tissue 
for in vitro assays makes STC-1 cells attractive for evaluating properties of EECs. Expression of α-synucle-
in in STC-1 cells was analyzed by real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Figure 1A 
shows the relative quantitation of Gapdh, α-synuclein (Snca), Cck, and Pyy in STC-1 cells compared with 
the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line. HeLa cells were used as the comparator and β-actin (Actb) transcript 
level was used to normalize RNA abundance. The relative amount of Snca mRNA in STC-1 cells (~15-fold) 
was comparable in magnitude to that present in SH-SY5Y cells (~34-fold), whereas STC-1 cells expressed 
a much higher amount of the Cck transcript (1.5 × 105–fold versus ~1-fold). The Pyy transcript was also 
expressed at a higher level in STC-1 cells (~150-fold), although SH-SY5Y cells appeared to express some 
PYY transcript (~8-fold) relative to HeLa cells. The relative amount of Gapdh/GAPDH mRNA was similar 
between the 3 cell lines examined.
To examine α-synuclein protein levels, a cellular extract of STC-1 cells was electrophoresed, along with 
whole-brain lysate from A53T mice and α-synuclein–knockout (Snca-/-)mice. A53T transgenic mice contain 4 
copies of the human α-synuclein gene carrying the A53T mutation on a Snca-/- background (41) (Figure 1B).

close juxtaposition to enteric nerves. Scale bar: 5 μm.

Using an α-synuclein antibody that has been extensively characterized (41), α-synuclein was found to be present 
in both STC-1 cell and A53T mouse brain extracts but not in brain extracts of Snca-/- mice (41). A faint non-
specific band was observed in both brain samples and has previously been noted with this antibody (Y
.-M. Kuo 
and R.L. Nussbaum, unpublished observations) (42). We also examined the cellular localization of α-synuclein 
in STC-1 cells by immunofluorescence. A general low level of α-synuclein immunofluorescence was present in 
the entire cytoplasm (Figure 1C). No immunofluorescence was detected in the absence of primary antibodies 
(Supplemental Figure 1; supplemental material available online with this article; https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.
insight.92295DS1).
Intestinal EECs express α-synuclein. The presence of α-synuclein in STC-1 cells suggested that this protein 
is expressed in EECs of the intestine. To evaluate this possibility, we purified GFP-positive CCK cells from 
the duodenums of CCK-GFP mice using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and quantitated gene expres-
sion by real-time PCR as described previously (43, 44). Cck gene expression was almost 2,000-fold greater 
than Actb in GFP-positive cells and Snca was over 150-fold increased over the control gene Actb (Figure 2A), 
indicating that α-synuclein mRNA is greatly enriched in CCK cells. In this experiment, α-synuclein RNA 
expression was compared between GFP-positive CCK cells and GFP-negative mucosal cells that contained 
non–CCK-GFP EECs. Since α-synuclein is expressed in non–CCK EECs (see data below), it is likely that 
this relative quantitation of Snca gene in CCK-GFP cells is an underestimation of the actual abundance of 
Snca transcript in CCK cells.
Characterizing α-synuclein in mice has been challenging, due, in part, to low endogenous levels of pro-
tein; thus, new genetic models have been used to enhance α-synuclein expression and assess its function. 
Therefore, as a first step, we examined α-synuclein expression in A53T mice. Our goal was to determine 
if α-synuclein expressed from the human promoter in A53T transgenic mice could be visualized in EECs.

Figure 2B shows α-synuclein immunofluorescence in the villus of 
the A53T mouse duodenum. α-Synuclein–positive enteric nerves 
were also present in the crypt region (Supplemental Figure 2). The 
CCK cell also expressed α-synuclein (Figure 2B, right), and the 
basolateral surface of this cell rested on an α-synuclein–contain-
ing nerve. No fluorescence in EECs was observed in the absence 
of CCK primary antibody (Supplemental Figure 3). In wild-type 
(CCK-GFP) mice, α-synuclein staining was detected within some 
CCK cells but could not easily be visualized in the enteric nerves 
(Supplemental Figure 4). The striking difference in immunofluo-
rescence intensity between A53T and wild-type mouse intestine 
could be attributed to higher levels of α-synuclein in A53T mice 
(41). It is also possible that the human protein is recognized better 
by the primary antibody used in these experiments. No α-synu-
clein staining was detected in the small intestines of Snca-/- mice 
(Supplemental Figure 5), suggesting that the staining observed in 
A53T mice was antigen specific (41).
Importantly, α-synuclein staining was also present in EECs 
in human duodenum, as shown in Figure 3 (a CCK cell present 
in the center of the image on the left is shown at higher magnification on the right). A small amount of 
α-synuclein was visible inside the CCK cell, and this cell was adjacent to the terminus of an α-synucle-
in–positive enteric nerve. However, using this technique, not all CCK cells were positive for α-synuclein 
and only a minority of cells were found in contact with enteric nerves. Approximately 71% of CCK cells 
contained intracellular α-synuclein, while 33% of the cells were apposed to α-synuclein in nerves or glia of 
A53T;CCK-GFP mice (Table 1).
To determine if α-synuclein is expressed in other EECs, we examined PYY-containing cells of the 
mouse and human intestine. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, α-synuclein is prominent in mouse and 
human PYY cells. The top row of images of Figure 4 show 4 GFP-positive PYY cells present in the 
colon of a PYY-GFP mouse. These cells expressed α-synuclein, and in one of the cells, the α-synuclein 
protein extended into the neuropod of the PYY cell. Enteric nerves were not visible in these sections, 
possibly because immunofluorescence of α-synuclein was very weak in the enteric nervous system of 
wild-type mice (45). The image on the bottom of Figure 4 shows a PYY-positive cell in the small intes-
tine of an A53T mouse that is located in close juxtaposition to an α-synuclein–containing enteric nerve, 
which runs in the lamina propria of the villus. α-Synuclein is also expressed in PYY cells of the human 
colon. The left side of Figure 5 shows two cells that express PYY and α-synuclein. The right side of 
Figure 5 shows colocalization of PYY and α-synuclein in 3 cells of the human colon. Approximately 
37% of PYY cells in the colon contain intracellular synuclein, and 32% of these cells are in contact with 
α-synuclein in nerves or glia (Table 1).
Chromogranin A is located in secretory vesicles of endocrine cells and has been used as a marker of 
most EECs. We identified α-synuclein in chromogranin A–positive cells (Supplemental Figure 6) in the 
intestine. α-Synuclein staining was also observed in rare mucosal cells that did not stain with one of the 
three EEC markers (CCK, PYY
, and chromogranin A) used in this study. Figure 6 shows a CCK-GFP cell 
located near an α-synuclein–positive but GFP-negative mucosal cell. The CCK cell expresses α-synuclein 
in the basolateral region and is located near a nerve identified with the pan-neuronal marker, protein gene 
product 9.5 (PGP9.5), that also contains α-synuclein. Notably, both the CCK and non-CCK α-synuclein–
positive mucosal cells contained intracellular PGP9.5. Since only one EEC marker was evaluated in any

given experiment, we cannot rule out the possibility that α-synucle-
in is expressed in an occasional non-EEC intestinal cell; however, 
the CCK and non-CCK cells possess the characteristic flask shape 
typical of EECs, and their α-synuclein and PGP9.5 expression 
imply neuronal properties.
α-Synuclein is expressed in the enteric nervous system. We also 
examined α-synuclein in submucosal enteric nerves using PGP9.5 
immunostaining. Previous studies have shown that α-synuclein 
and PGP9.5 colocalize in cutaneous autonomic nerves (46). Fig-
ure 7 shows that α-synuclein is present in PGP9.5-positive nerves. 
However, the distribution of α-synuclein in the nerves is not contin-
uous but appears to be localized to distinct zones or domains. This 
observation was also apparent in Figure 2B and Figure 3, where 
the α-synuclein staining is not continuous, but patchy, although a pattern of fluidity can be constructed. 
Higher magnification of the α-synuclein–positive mucosal cell revealed numerous microscopic process-
es that extend from the surface of the cell and appear to make contact with the PGP9.5-positive enteric 
nerve. The images in Figure 7 clearly demonstrate that α-synuclein is present in mucosal cells (e.g., EECs) 
and suggest that α-synuclein has the potential to migrate from specific mucosal cells (EECs) into enteric 
nerves not only via endocytosis of extracellular α-synuclein (47, 48) but also through direct physical contact 
between mucosal cells and enteric nerves.
Previous studies have shown that α-synuclein and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) are coexpressed in the 
brain and dopaminergic cell lines and that α-synuclein may play a role in regulating dopamine synthesis 
(49, 50). TH is also known to be expressed in neurons of the enteric nervous system, and TH mRNA 
was previously detected in intestinal PYY cells by real-time PCR (33, 51). Interestingly, EECs, like 
PD-affected neurons, are TH positive. Figure 8 shows that TH protein is detected by immunofluores-
cence in α-synuclein–positive mucosal cells of the human colon.
Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is a common marker for identification of glia. To determine if glia 
also express α-synuclein, we examined the expression of GFAP in the human duodenum (Figure 9). Glial

processes were not very abundant in the human duo-
denal sections used for this work, and the immunofluo-
rescence was not bright; however, α-synuclein was pres-
ent in certain regions of GFAP-positive glial processes. 
Supplemental Figure 7 shows that there is some colocal-
ization of α-synuclein and GFAP in frozen sections of 
the perfused mouse duodenum. In other regions of the 
tissue, GFAP staining appeared to surround α-synucle-
in–positive nerves. The pattern of α-synuclein expres-
sion was similar to that described above for enteric 
nerves, where it was not distributed evenly in the entire 
glial process but visible in small areas or domains. The 
factors that cause the segregation and maintenance of 
α-synuclein in these domains remain to be established.
In summary, here we demonstrate that α-synuclein is expressed in the EEC line STC-1 as well as in mouse 
and human EECs of the duodenum and colon. α-Synuclein is also expressed in enteric nerves and to a lesser 
extent in enteric glia. Some EECs are in direct contact with α-synuclein–containing nerves, which could lead 
to the transmission of aggregated α-synuclein from EECs to the enteric nervous system (Figure 10).
Discussion
In our earlier studies, we were impressed by the abundance of neuronal features found in EECs. Using con-
focal microscopy and 3D serial block face electron microscopy, we noticed that EECs possessed axon-like 
basal processes containing neurofilaments, presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, prominent secretory ves-
icles, and neurotrophin receptors (33, 35, 52). Gene expression profiling revealed that EECs express mRNA 
for DOPA decarboxylase and TH, enzymes essential for dopamine synthesis (33). Our identification of 
PGP9.5 in EECs further expands the neuronal repertoire of EECs. The discovery that EECs connect to 
nerves raises a number of intriguing possibilities for how nutrients, bacteria, toxins, and potential patho-
gens gain access to and communicate with the nervous system. This neural circuit may have implications 
for the origin of neurological diseases that involve the gut or whose cause remains obscure.
PD is a neurodegenerative disease with prominent gut manifestations. Lewy pathology spreads along 
neural pathways and involves vagal nerves (12, 15, 53), and the recent observation that bilateral vag-
otomy reduces the risk of PD supports the concept that the causative agent in PD is transmitted from 
gut to the brain (19). Realizing that the disease origin has been elusive, we postulated that if EECs con-
tained α-synuclein, they could be involved in the pathogenesis of PD. To this end, we made several key 
observations. First and central to this hypothesis is our discovery that α-synuclein is expressed in EECs. 
The histological appearance within cells is consistent with cytoplasmic expression of α-synuclein that 
is concentrated at the basal surface of the EEC, where we previously identified synaptic vesicles (35). 
α-Synuclein expression is another example of the neuron-like properties of EECs, and, together with the 
expression of other presynaptic proteins, it suggests that EECs are involved in neurotransmission.
Second, α-synuclein is expressed in EECs in both the small and large intestine. We used several com-
plimentary approaches to characterize EECs, including peptide hormone–specific antisera in combination 
with antibodies to α-synuclein, neuronal proteins (e.g., PGP9.5), and biosynthetic enzymes (e.g., TH). 
α-Synuclein was confirmed in CCK cells, which are most prominent in the proximal intestine as well as 
in PYY-containing cells of the distal small intestine and colon in both mice and humans. However, even 
though we characterized these two types of EECs, we do not believe α-synuclein expression is limited to 
Figure 7. α-Synuclein–containing mucosal cell is in contact 
with an enteric nerve. Left: Paraffin-embedded section of

CCK and PYY EECs, as it was present in certain non-CCK and PYY mucosal cells. Specifically, we iden-
tified α-synuclein in mucosal cells containing chromogranin A, a more general marker of EECs. Therefore, 
it is likely that α-synuclein expression is common to multiple types of EECs. Within the gastrointestinal 
tract, EECs containing α-synuclein were more abundant in the proximal small intestine, where vagal neural 
innervation is more extensive. It is likely that exposure of EECs to ingested toxins or pathogens would be 
greater in the small intestine than the colon, making EECs in the proximal region of the gut more suscepti-
ble to changes that could affect the nervous system.
Third, EECs in which α-synuclein is expressed lie in close proximity to α-synuclein–expressing 
enteric neurons. The hypothesis that abnormal α-synuclein arises in EECs and spreads to enteric 
neurons requires cellular contact. Such an association was apparent, as α-synuclein expression was 
observed in juxtaposed EECs and α-synuclein–containing nerves. However, α-synuclein was not 
observed in neurons or glia apposing every α-synuclein–containing EEC, suggesting that α-synuclein 
does not move in a retrograde direction from the nervous system onto EECs. Finally, finding α-synu-
clein expression in EECs of both the mouse and human intestine is encouraging for the use of rodent 
models to study PD pathogenesis.
Glial cells are closely associated with enteric neurons, in that they provide support for neuronal 
function (54). Recently, it has been demonstrated that enteric glia may be adversely affected in PD (55). 
Our observation that α-synuclein is expressed in enteric glia has additional implications for the possible 
cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein. Cell-to-cell transfer of α-synuclein requires close cell contact but may 
or may not require synaptic transmission (8). We have previously demonstrated the EECs come into inti-
mate contact with enteric glia (35), and our current demonstration that α-synuclein is coexpressed with 
glial markers raises the possibility that glia could participate in transfer of α-synuclein from EECs to the 
nervous system (56).
As cells residing in the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, EECs are uniquely positioned to sample 
gut contents and to relay those signals to the brain through a direct neural connection. However, the stability 
of an EEC-neural connection seemed unlikely when it was assumed that EECs behaved like enterocytes, 
which are born in the intestinal crypt, migrate up the villus, and are sloughed into the gut lumen within 3–5 
days. This dynamic relationship in which cells are constantly moving and dying did not seem conducive to 
establishing long-lived contact with the nervous system. However, this concern dissipated when we discov-
ered that some EECs reside in the mucosa for months (33). Therefore, the EEC-neuronal connection is likely 
to be long lived and sufficient for conveying pathological events.
Alterations in gut microbiota have been associated with PD, and recent evidence suggests that microbes 
from PD patients are pathogenic (29). Although it is not clear how gut microbes influence the nervous 
system, it is possible that this occurs through EECs. Microbial generation of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) 
has been implicated in PD progression (28, 29), and it is conceivable that this occurs through EECs, includ-
ing CCK and PYY cells, which have been shown to express SCFA receptors (e.g., FFAR2 and -3) (57–60).

Gastrointestinal complications, including constipation and gastroparesis, are common in PD and are 
believed to be secondary to impaired enteric neuronal activity. However, EECs have profound effects on 
gastrointestinal motility and secretion (61, 62); based on their multitude of neuronal-like characteristics, 
including their dopaminergic properties and α-synuclein expression, it is possible that EEC function is also 
adversely affected in PD. Therefore, it is interesting to speculate that EEC dysfunction occurs in PD and 
contributes to gastrointestinal manifestations.
The lining of the gastrointestinal tract is readily accessible to endoscopic biopsy, and attempts have 
been made to evaluate gastrointestinal tissue for abnormal α-synuclein (63–65). These approaches have not 
yet led to a diagnostic test for PD, but, with identification of α-synuclein in EECs (that are easily visible in 
even the most superficial of tissue samples), it may now be possible to use gastrointestinal biopsy tissues to 
detect abnormal α-synuclein in EECs in individuals with early or preclinical PD.
The discovery of α-synuclein in EECs, which are exposed to substances in the gut lumen, provides 
a previously unrecognized location in which changes to α-synuclein could occur. Should changes in 
α-synuclein conformation develop, leading to assembly and spread of α-synuclein in a prion-like manner, 
it is possible that EECs, by virtue of their neuronal connection, play a critical role in transmitting PD 
pathology from the gut to the brain.

Figure 10. Hypothetical pathway for pathogenic migration of α-synuclein in the gut. The apical surface of enteroendocrine cells (EECs) is exposed to the 
lumen and thus is in contact with ingested toxins and metabolites produced by gut microbes. The basolateral surface of EECs is in contact with enteric 
nerves and glia. We propose that toxin uptake by EEC can cause aggregation of α-synuclein inside these cells and this aggregated protein can migrate to 
enteric nerves, thereby initiating a pathogenic cascade leading to α-synucleinopathies.

Methods
Mouse and human intestinal tissue samples. CCK-GFP transgenic mice (52) were procured from Mutant Mouse 
Resource and Research Centers (University of Missouri). FVB;129S6-Snca1Nbm Tg(SNCA*A53T)1Nbm Tg(SN-
CA*A53T)2Nbm/J mice (41) and Snca-/- (66) mice were obtained from R.L. Nussbaum. CCK-GFP mice were 
mated with FVB;129S6-Snca1Nbm Tg(SNCA*A53T)1Nbm Tg(SNCA*A53T)2Nbm/J mice (41) to generate the 
A53T;CCK-GFP line of mice that expresses GFP in CCK cells. FVB;129S6-Snca1Nbm Tg(SNCA*A53T)1Nbm 
Tg(SNCA*A53T)2Nbm/J (41), Snca-/- (66), A53T;CCK-GFP
, or PYY-GFP (67) mice were euthanized and 
perfused with 3.5% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde. Intestinal tissue was harvested and paraffin 
embedded or cryopreserved in sucrose and embedded in OCT. Sections (5- to 20-μm thick) were collected on 
plus charged slides and used for immunostaining.
Paraffin-embedded sections of human duodenum or colon on deidentified slides were provided by A. Hiniker.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA from STC-1, SH-SY5Y
, and HeLa cells (ATCC) was isolated using an RNeasy 
kit (Qiagen). RNA was treated with DNase I (Ambion, ThermoFisher Scientific), and 2 μg RNA was 
reverse transcribed using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). Real-
time PCR was performed using inventoried TaqMan assays that spanned an exon: Actb (Mm4394036_g1, 
Hs01060665_g1), Cck (Mm00446170_m1, Hs00174937_m1), Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1, Hs02758991_g1), 
Pyy (Mm00520716_g1, Hs00373890_g1), and Snca (Mm01188700_m1, Hs00240906_m1).
For real-time PCR of murine intestinal CCK cells, GFP-positive cells and an equal number of 
GFP-negative cells were collected from the duodenum of CCK-GFP transgenic mice as described previ-
ously (44). Total RNA was isolated and reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript reverse transcriptase 
(Invitrogen), preamplified using TaqMan Preamp Master Mix, and used for real-time PCR quantitation 
(Applied Biosytems) as described previously (44). TaqMan gene expression assay IDs are as follows: Actb 
(Mm00607939_s1), Cck (Mm00446170_m1), Gapdh (Mm99999915_g1), and Snca (Mn00447331_m1).
Western blot. STC-1 cells grown to 70% confluency were rinsed briefly with cold PBS (10 mM sodium 
phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.9% NaCl) and lysed in 30 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 2.5% SDS, and 5% glycerol. The 
lysate was briefly homogenized with a Polytron, heated at 95°C for 10 minutes, and centrifuged at 2,800 g for 
10 minutes at 4°C. Mouse brains were harvested rapidly after euthanasia and added to 4 ml prechilled RIPA 
buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mM EDTA) 
and homogenized with a Polytron. The homogenate was centrifuged at 36,000 g for 30 minutes at 4°C in a 
Type 70 Ti fixed angle rotor (Beckman Coulter). The supernate was collected and protein concentration was 
measured using the Micro BCA kit (Thermo Scientific Pierce). The protein extract was mixed with Bolt 4X 
Sample buffer (Invitrogen Novex) and 5% β-mercaptoethanol to obtain a final concentration of 2 mg/ml total 
protein. STC-1 cell and brain extracts (10 μg) were loaded on a 4%–12% Bis-Tris Bolt gel and electrophoresed 
at 165 V for 30 minutes. The proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane and the membrane was incubated 
for 30 minutes in 0.4% freshly depolymerized paraformaldehyde in PBS (68), rinsed with PBS, and incubated 
with α-synuclein mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories; Supplemental Table 1). After 
incubation with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Thermo Scientific Pierce), α-synuclein pro-
tein was detected by chemiluminescence (ECL Prime Western Blotting Detection Reagent, GE HealthCare) 
and the signal was captured using ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.).
Immunochemistry. All antibodies used for immunofluorescence experiments are listed in Supple-
mental Table 1.
STC-1 cells. STC-1 cells were grown on poly-D lysine–coated chamber slides. When cells had reached 
the desired confluency, they were washed with PBS and fixed for 10 minutes in 10% formalin. β-Tubulin 
polyclonal antibody raised in rabbit (Novus Biologicals LLC) and mouse α-synuclein antibody (BD Trans-
duction Laboratories) were used for immunostaining as described below. Cells were imaged in the absence 
of primary antibody to assess the specificity of the primary antibody, and images were captured at the same 
gain as images with primary antibody.
Tissue sections. Paraffin-embedded sections were cleared in xylene and hydrated by passing through 
graded alcohols. Antigen retrieval was performed by one of three methods described below depending 
on the antigens being visualized: (a) slides were heated in a 2100 Retriever (Aptum Biologics Ltd.) for 20 
minutes in 10 mM sodium citrate, pH 6.0 (Sigma-Aldrich), and allowed to cool slowly for 2 hours; (b) slides 
were pulse heated in boiling 0.1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) for 10 minutes in a microwave and allowed to cool 
to room temperature over 30 minutes; and (c) slides were incubated in 70% formic acid (Fisher Scientific) 
for 30 minutes at room temperature. After antigen retrieval, sections were rinsed in water and PBS. Frozen

sections were thawed, fixed for 10 minutes in either 10% formalin or a chilled 1:1 mixture of methanol and 
acetone, and used for immunostaining. All sections were blocked in 10% donkey serum in 10 mM Tris, pH 
7.4, 0.9% NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 (TBST) for 30 minutes at room temperature to limit nonspecific anti-
body association. In experiments in which the α-synuclein signal was amplified, sections were treated with 
2% H2O2 in PBS for 30 minutes and incubated in 2% blocking reagent (Tyramide signal amplification kit, 
Invitrogen). Incubation with primary antibodies was performed at 4°C in TBST plus 0.2% BSA. Sections 
were washed 3 times with TBST (5 minutes each time) and then incubated with secondary antibodies (see 
Supplemental Table 2) (minimal cross reactivity, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 hour at 
room temperature. After 3 washes with TBST, tyramide signal amplification was performed using direc-
tions provided by the manufacturer. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye, and sections were mounted 
using ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). Images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM 780 or 880 Airy Scan inverted 
confocal microscope, with a Zeiss ×20/0.8 NA or ×40/1.4 NA Oil Plan-Apochromat DIC, (UV) VIS-IR 
(420762-9900) objective. Images were collected using 405-, 488-, 561-, and 647-nm laser lines for excitation, 
and emission filters of BP420-480 (Hoechst dye), BP505-550 (DyLight/Alexa Fluor 488) LP575 (Cy3), 
and BP 640/30 (Alexa Fluor 647) were used. Pinholes were set to 1 airy unit for each channel, and line 
averaging of 4 or 8 was used with ×0.7–1 optical zoom. Z-stacks with an interval of 0.4 μm were acquired 
and 3D images were rendered using Imaris software (Bitplane Inc.). Sections were imaged in the absence 
of primary antibodies, and images were captured at the same gain as images with primary antibody. No 
endogenous tissue fluorescence was observed in the absence of primary antibodies.
