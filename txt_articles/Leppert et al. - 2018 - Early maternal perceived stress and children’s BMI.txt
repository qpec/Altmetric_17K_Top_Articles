Abstract
Background: Maternal perceived stress has been discussed to contribute to the development of childhood
overweight. Our aim was to investigate the longitudinal relationship of early maternal perceived stress and BMI z-
scores in preschool children (≤ five years).
Methods: A longitudinal analysis was conducted in 498 mother-child pairs of the German prospective birth cohort
LINA with information on maternal perceived stress during pregnancy, one and two years after birth. BMI z-scores
were based on annual measurements of children’s weight/height and calculated based on WHO reference data.
General estimation equations were applied to evaluate the impact of maternal stress on children’s longitudinal BMI
z-scores. Potential stressors contributing to the perceived stress of the mother were assessed by linear regression
models. Using mediation analyses we evaluated the relationship between stressors, maternal perceived stress, and
children’s BMI z-score development.
Results: Postnatal maternal stress during the first year after birth had a positive longitudinal relationship with children’s
BMI z-scores up to the age of five years. Gender-stratified analyses revealed that only girls showed this positive
association while boy’s BMI z-scores were unaffected by maternal stress. We identified three neighborhood strains and
two socio-demographic factors, which contributed to the maternal perceived stress level. Stressors themselves did not
directly affect girl’s BMI z-scores but rather mediated their effect through the perceived stress level.
Conclusions: While different stressors contribute to maternal stress, the perceived stress level - rather than the
stressors themselves - is strongly positively associated with BMI z-score development in girls.

Background
Overweight and obesity prevalence, especially among
preschool children, has risen dramatically world-wide
over the last decades affecting 6.1% of children under
five years of age in 2016 [1]. Recent data from the
KiGGS study shows that in Germany this fraction is
even higher with 9.5% of children age two-six being
overweight, of which 2.8% are classified as obese [2].
This is particularly concerning as most of these children
will remain overweight in adolescence and adulthood,
increasing their risk for co-morbidities like cardiovascu-
lar diseases or type 2 diabetes mellitus [3, 4].
Unhealthy diet and physical inactivity have been de-
scribed as the main risk factors contributing to obesity
development [5]. Consequently, child obesity interven-
tion and prevention studies are mainly focusing on
implementing changes in eating behavior and physical
activity. However, most of these studies failed to reach
long-term effects [6, 7], suggesting that other factors
such as the living environment and parental behavior
play an important role in the context of children’s over-
weight development. Among others, psychological as-
pects like early infant parental distress [8] as well as

 maternal depression [9] emerged as potential factors
promoting children’s overweight.
Accumulating research shows the wide-ranging conse-
quences of maternal stress on children’s health, which
among others include an increased risk for behavioral
problems, asthma, reduced birth weight, and an increased
risk for becoming overweight [10–12]. Perceived stress is
the individual perception about the stressfulness of life
and the ability to handle such stress, which can be influ-
enced by a variety of sources. These so-called stressors in-
clude socioeconomic disadvantages as well as recent life
events like divorce/separation that can ultimately lead to
stress-related physiological dysregulations [13, 14]. In this
context maternal stress during pregnancy is known to
alter signaling in the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (HPA)
exposing the developing fetus to an excess of glucocorti-
coids [15], one of the mechanisms discussed to contribute
to prenatal growth restriction [16, 17] and an accelerated
catch-up-growth increasing the risk for obesity in chil-
dren’s later life [18–20]. While in the prenatal phase the
physiological stress response of the mother can directly
affect the child, in the postnatal period - as assessed here
in the first two years after birth - the impact of maternal
stress on parenting behavior and mother-child interactions
become important. There is evidence that changes in feed-
ing styles and practices [21] due to parental or maternal
stress can have a significant impact on children’s food
composition and energy intake [22]. Especially maternal
stress becomes important as mothers often spend signifi-
cantly more time in direct interaction with the child com-
pared to the fathers. For example higher infant energy
intake and increased consumption of breads and cereals
during the first six month after birth have been described
in association with maternal stress or depression [23], as
has children’s reduced consumption of fruits and vegeta-
bles [24, 25]. Moreover, stress perceived by children them-
selves seems to alter their energy intake and food selection
with a preference for sweet and high fat foods [25].
The majority of studies conducted so far focused on
prenatal or postnatal stress exclusively, while longitu-
dinal maternal stress assessments in relation to chil-
dren’s
weight
development
are
rare.
As
recently
reviewed by Tate et al. [12] and O’Connor et al. [26]
most of these studies only used either longitudinal infor-
mation on maternal stress or children’s overweight de-
velopment. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the
association between maternal stress and body mass
index (BMI) trajectories in children in a longitudinal
manner, including maternal stress evaluations from
pregnancy until children’s age of two years and annual
weight assessments of the children up to the age of five
years. We complement our study by analyzing which
stressors might contribute to the perceived maternal
stress level and therefore might have a potential impact
also on children’s weight development throughout the
years. It has been discussed that the living environment
including noise exposure and an unsecure living envir-
onment influence weight development in adults [27–29].
Since data on the effects of such stressors on children is
sparse [30] we included not only the socioeconomic sta-
tus of the study participants, but also factors characteriz-
ing their living environment such as traffic or residential
noise in our analysis.
We hypothesize that with our longitudinal qualitative
stress assessment we will be able to identify a time win-
dow, in which the child is particularly vulnerable to ma-
ternal stress and that such stress exposure experienced
in this time window might have a long-lasting effect on
the development of overweight in the child.
Methods
Study characteristics
The German prospective birth cohort LINA (Lifestyle
and Environmental
Factors and their Influence on
Newborns Allergy risk) recruited 629 mother-child pairs
at pregnancy (36th week of gestation) during May 2006
and December 2008, as has been described in more de-
tail elsewhere[31–33]. Lifestyle, housing, and environ-
mental factors were assessed by questionnaires during
pregnancy and annually thereafter. Stress questionnaires
from three time points (pregnancy, age 1, age 2) together
with information on gender, gestational week at delivery,
mode of delivery, breastfeeding and prenatal environmen-
tal tobacco smoke exposure (ETS) were available for 498
mother-child pairs, which we defined as our analyzed
sub-cohort
(Table
1).
All
questionnaires
were
self-administered by the parents and participation in the
study was voluntary. Written informed consent was ob-
tained from all individual participants included in the
study. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee
of the University of Leipzig (file ref # 046-2006, 160-2008,
160b/2008, 144-10-31052010, 113-11-18042011).
Perceived maternal stress assessment
Maternal stress levels were assessed at 36th weeks of ges-
tation and at the one- and two-year follow-up using the
20-item reduced Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), a
validated instrument by Fliege et al. [34, 35]. The PSQ is
comprised of 5 items for each of the different stress di-
mensions “demands”, “tension”, “worries”, and “lack of
joy”. All items were scored on a four-point scale accord-
ing to the frequency of perception with one (hardly ever)
to four (usually). The total stress score was derived as
the mean of all 20 scored questions. The scores for each
dimension
were
derived
accordingly
from
the
5
dimension-specific questions [36]. Higher scores indicate
higher stress levels.

 Anthropometric data
Children’s body weight and height up to the age of five
years were obtained from annual clinical visits or from
questionnaires of well-child exams (“U examination”).
Child length was measured horizontally at birth and at
the year 1 follow-up using an infantometer (“Dr. Keller
II”). From year two onwards standing height was mea-
sured without shoes to the nearest 0.1 cm (“Dr. Keller
I”). Body weight was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg, and
BMI z-scores were calculated according to the WHO
reference data [37] to adjust for child’s age and gender.
The use of z-scores is recommended for several reasons.
First, z-scores are calculated based on the distribution of
the reference population (both the mean and the SD);
thus, they reflect the reference distribution. Second, as
standardized measures, BMI z-scores are comparable
across age and sex. Third, a group of z-scores can be sub-
ject to summary statistics such as mean and SD and - even
more importantly in our case - can be studied as a con-
tinuous variable. Children with BMI z-score < -1 were
classified as underweight, children with a BMI z-score of
-1 to <1 were classified as normal weight, and children
with BMI z-scores ≥1 were classified as overweight.
Assessment of stressors
We assessed the impact of several stressors evaluated by
questionnaires on maternal stress perceived during the
first year after birth. The stressors evaluated considered
the neighborhood quality (living conditions, exposure to
traffic or residential noise) and the socio-demographic
factors (household income, parental educational level,
number of household members, the age of the mother at
birth, divorce/separation).
Information about the household income, the parental
educational level and the number of household members
(all children and adults in the household), were recorded
once
during
pregnancy.
Neighborhood
quality
was
assessed each year from pregnancy onwards using the
questions summarized in Additional file 1: Table S1. The
information on divorce/separation was based on a retro-
spective assessment at year two with respect to the pre-
ceding three years, the exact time point of divorce/
separation was not inquired.
Statistical analysis
In all analyses except where explicitly stated otherwise, a
p-values ≤ 0.05 was considered to be significant. When-
ever Bonferroni-correction was applied the adjusted sig-
nificant levels are indicated.
To test for potential differences in study characteristics
of
the
entire
cohort
compared
to
the
analyzed
sub-cohort and to test for equal distribution of parame-
ters in the gender-specific analyses chi-square tests were
conducted. The maternal perceived stress scores were
assessed by Spearman correlations and a repeated meas-
urement analysis of variance (RANOVA) was performed
to assess time-dependent changes.
Generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with un-
structured correlation matrices were applied to assess the
effect of maternal stress on children’s longitudinal BMI
z-scores (birth to age five or age one to age five respect-
ively). These models were calculated with BMI z-scores
and maternal perceived stress scores as continuous vari-
ables and were adjusted for weight-related confounding
parameters based on a literature review[38–40], namely:
gestational week at delivery, mode of delivery, breastfeed-
ing duration, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke
(urinary cotinine level during pregnancy, as described in
Table 1), and for gender if applicable. To test for gender
differences in response to maternal perceived stress the
GEE models were stratified accordingly.
A principal factor analysis with oblique rotation was
conducted on 10 questionnaire items assessing neighbor-
hood
strains
to
extract
potential
underlying
scales
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Factors with an eigenvalue
greater than 1 were chosen following Kaiser’s criterion.
Scales were composed of variables with factor loadings
greater 0.4. These extracted scales together with different
socio-demographic-factors (household income, parental
educational level, number of household members, age of
the mother at birth, divorce/separation) were assessed by
linear regression for their impact on maternal perceived
stress and the different dimensions thereof.
Mediation analysis based on the PROCESS SPSS
macro (release 2.16.3 [41]) was applied to test the hy-
pothesis whether the stressors identified to contribute to
the perceived maternal stress level affect children’s BMI
z-score development directly or indirectly. For this pur-
pose, children were categorized in being overweight
(BMI z-score ≥ 1) ever in the first five years of life and
compared to children never being overweight (BMI-z--
scores <1) in this time window. Perceived stress scores
and stressors were considered as continuous variables in
these analyses. Confidence intervals were computed
based on 5000 bootstrap samples.
General
statistical
analyses,
regression-
and
GEE
models were conducted using STATISTICA 12.0 for
Windows (Dell Inc., USA) or IBM SPSS Statistics ver-
sion 22 (IBM Corps., USA) respectively.
Results
Study characteristics
Our analyses were based on the sub-cohort of 498
mother-child pairs for which a complete PSQ assessment
for pregnancy, year 1 and year 2 including all weight-related
confounders were available. General study characteristics of
the analyzed sub-cohort (n=498) and the entire LINA co-
hort (n=629) were equally distributed as shown in Table 1.

Page 4 of 10
 In the analyzed sub-cohort the majority of children (68 %)
started daycare in their second year of life.
Perceived maternal stress assessment
Pre-and postnatal maternal stress levels were highly cor-
related with each other (Spearman correlation, birth vs.
age 1: R= 0.60, p<10-13; age 1 vs. age 2: R= 0.69, p<10-13;
birth vs. age 2: R= 0. 58 p<10-13). There was a statisti-
cally significant increase in the maternal perceived stress
scores over time as determined by RANOVA (F = 3772,
p<0.0005, partial eta-squared = 0.94). An overview of
median, minimum, maximum, lower and upper quartiles
of maternal stress scores over time is given in Table 2A.
Anthropometric data
On average, about 15.5 % of the analyzed LINA children
became overweight during the first five years of life,
reaching highest percentages at year two and three. A
summary of categorized BMI z-scores of preschool chil-
dren up to the age of five years is given in Table 2B.
Longitudinal association of maternal perceived stress and
children’s BMI z-scores
The adjusted GEE model showed a significant longitudinal
effect on children’s BMI z-scores until the age of 5 years
only for maternal perceived stress assessed at year one
(adj. β: 0.23, 95% CI (0.08-0.37), p = 0.002) (Table 3A,
Additional file 1: Table S2). There was no effect of mater-
nal stress during pregnancy or year two on children’s BMI
z-scores. Neither weight- nor height- z-scores were af-
fected by maternal stress (data not shown).
Stratifying the GEE model for gender revealed a posi-
tive association of BMI z-scores with maternal stress
during the first year after birth only for of girl’s (adj. β:
0.30, 95% CI (0.11-0.49), p = 0.002; Table 3B, Additional
file 1: Table S3), whereas no association was seen for
boys. This gender-specific effect was not based on differ-
ent study characteristics between boys and girls, as can
be seen from Additional file 1: Table S4. As only mater-
nal perceived stress during the first year after birth had
an effect on BMI z-scores, we focused our further ana-
lyses on this early postnatal period.
Influence of different stress dimensions on BMI z-score
development
Median, minimum, maximum, lower (<25%) and upper
quartiles (>75%) of the four maternal stress dimensions
assessed by the PSQ (“demands”, “tension”, “worries”
and “lack of joy”) are given in Additional file 1: Table S5.
GEE models were applied to evaluate their association
with children’s longitudinal BMI z-scores. Results of the
adjusted models are summarized in Table 4. After
Bonferroni-correction, the stress dimensions “tension”,
“lack of joy”, and “demands” showed a significantly posi-
tive association with children’s BMI z-scores. Similar to
the total stress score the different dimensions of mater-
nal stress only showed an association to girl’s BMI
z-scores. “Worries”, “lack of joy”, and “demands” were
significantly associated with higher BMI z-scores in girls,
“lack of joy” showed the best model fit (QIC).
Influence of maternal stress on early maternal feeding
behavior
The strong association of maternal perceived stress on
BMI z-scores during the first year of life suggested a
possible involvement of breastfeeding duration or the
time of solid food introduction. However, both parame-
ters, evaluated in three-month-intervals during the first
year of life, were not related to pre- and postnatal mater-
nal perceived stress in our analyses (Additional file 1:
Table S6).
Multiple stressors contribute to maternal stress
perception
Based on a 10-items questionnaire assessing the neigh-
borhood quality (Additional file 1: Table S1), three fac-
tors, which in combination explained 58.1% of the
variance (Additional file 1: Table S7), were extracted. The
items that clustered on the same factor loadings suggest
that the factors represent “poor living conditions”, bur-
dens due to “traffic”, and exposure to “residential noise”,

 respectively (Additional file 1: Table S7). For each of these
three factors corresponding variables were created includ-
ing items with a factor loading >0.4. The variable “poor
living conditions” considered the occurrence of vandalism,
graffities, dirty streets and attempted break-ins in the liv-
ing environment. The impairment due to “traffic” was
summarized by items asking for disturbance due to traffic
noise or related odors or exhausts. The variable “Noise”
took into account noise from pedestrians and neighbors.
All three of these variables showed a significant associ-
ation to the maternal stress level at year one (Fig. 1).
Of the socio-demographic factors analyzed, only low
household income contributed significantly to the over-
all stress perceived by the mothers (Fig. 1, Additional file
1: Table S8). Parental separation or divorce during the
first three years (available from 191 participants) signifi-
cantly increased the total maternal stress level at year 1
and three of the four different dimensions thereof
(Additional file 1: Table S9).
Associations of different stressors on stress dimensions
While “worries”, “tension”, and “demands” were similarly
positively associated with the factors of poor neighbor-
hood quality, “lack of joy” was not affected (Additional
file 1: Figure S1A). However, “lack of joy” was positively
associated with a “low household income”, as was an in-
crease in “worries”. A low educational level and the
number of household members, which were not associ-
ated to the overall maternal stress level, were signifi-
cantly associated with the stress dimensions “lack of joy”
and “demands”.
Impact of stressors on BMI z-score development
To further elucidate how the stressors, which showed a
significant association with the maternal perceived stress
level at year 1 (see Additional file 1: Table S8), namely
noise, traffic, poor living environment) and a low house-
hold income affect the BMI z-score development we
assessed their relationship by mediation analyses. These
stressors did not affect girl’s BMI z-score development
directly. However, they had an indirect effect on BMI
z-scores
mediated
by
maternal
perceived
stress
(Additional file 1: Figure S1B). Due to the small case
number the effect of divorce/separation could not be
further evaluated in the mediation analysis.

 Discussion
Obesity is a multifactorial disease with an often pro-
tracted onset in childhood and adolescence. Despite the
appreciation that high caloric intake and sedentary be-
havior contribute to overweight development, less atten-
tion has been given to the effects of pre- and postnatal
perceived maternal stress on weight development in
early childhood. Given the few longitudinal studies
evaluating this relationship in children [8, 39, 42, 43] our
aim was to investigate whether and how maternal stress
assessed at different time points in the highly vulnerable
early pre- and postnatal period is related to overweight
development in preschool children.
Previous studies have suggested that dramatic life events
during the prenatal phase, such as the occurrence of a nat-
ural disaster or the death of a close relative, can contribute
to overweight development in preschool children or in
young teenagers [44–46]. In our study we did not observe
a longitudinal association of prenatal stress on BMI
z-scores but rather identified the perceived stressfulness
for the mother during the first year of life as an important
factor for an increase in BMI z-scores. This observation is
in line with a recent meta-analysis by Tate et al., suggest-
ing that toddlers (1-3 years old) are more vulnerable to
maternal stress than infants (<one year) [12]. In addition,
as the type of stress evaluated in our study is most likely
not comparable in its impact to a natural disaster, the
missing association between prenatal perceived stress and
BMI z-scores might also at least in part be related to the
difference in the type of stress evaluated.
As only maternal stress during the first year after birth
had an effect on BMI trajectories we hypothesized that
duration of breast feeding, which can be negatively af-
fected by maternal stress, might play a role [47]. However,
we did not observe significant differences in breastfeeding
duration or the time of solid food introduction in relation
to the maternal stress level. This does not exclude the pos-
sibility that maternal feeding styles and attitudes may play
a role [48, 49] as earlier studies indicate that the
parent-created environment can foster obesity-promoting
feeding styles and attitudes, which shape the child’s food
preferences [50, 51]. In older children however, other so-
cial influences and food environments experienced in day-
care or preschool may dilute the maternal stress effect.
Although this is in line with our observation that only ma-
ternal perceived stress during the first year but not there-
after had a persistent effect on BMI z-scores, the design of
our study did not allow further evaluation of parental
feeding styles and attitudes.
Although high maternal stress levels were associated
with higher BMI z-scores in the total LINA cohort, this
effect was only present in girls, whereas boys were not
affected. Similar observations were made by Suglia et al.
[39], who described a higher risk of being obese for
five-year-old girls, who had experienced high cumulative
stress (including food insecurity, housing insecurity, ma-
ternal depressive symptoms, and maternal substance
abuse) compared to girls without this experience, a simi-
lar effect was missing in boys [39].
In adults and adolescents gender disparity in stress
perception and processing has previously been associ-
ated to differences in coping mechanisms [52–54]. Chil-
dren seem to respond in a similar way as in particular
girls have been described to respond by impulsive eating,
emotional binge eating, and by requesting sweet and
high fat foods [25, 39, 55]. In light of these previous
findings, our results suggest that already at a very young
age changes in eating behavior might play a role in the
gender-disparity of BMI-development related to the ex-
perience of stress.
In accordance with what we saw for the overall mater-
nal perceived stress, “demands”, “worries” and “lack of
joy” had a strong positive association with BMI z-scores
in girls only. There are several studies suggesting that
maternal depression can promote overweight develop-
ment in children [56, 57], with indications that this
might also be a gender-specific effect [9], e.g. Hernandez
et al. reported that maternal depression placed females
but not males at a higher risk for obesity at age 18 [58].
On a last scale of our analyses we aimed to characterize
potential stressors, which add to the perceived maternal
stress level throughout the years. We were able to identify
three potential stressors, which were all related to the
quality of the living environment (burden due to traffic,
residential noise, and poor living conditions) contributing
to the overall maternal perceived stress.
We show in this study that different sources of noise
including “Residential Noise” - noise from neighbors and
pedestrians - and “Traffic” summarizing traffic noise and
exhaust, can affect the maternal stress level. Noise ex-
posure is a well-described example of a potentially obe-
sogenic factor, which has already been studied for its
impact on prenatal/postnatal growth [59–61] and in as-
sociation to adiposity and metabolic outcomes in adults
[27, 29, 62]. Noise during pregnancy and childhood in-
creased the risk of overweight at age 7, although no as-
sociation to BMI z-scores was found in this study [63].
Also, an unsecure living environment has been sug-
gested to contribute to overweight development. While
Mathis et al. observed that adults who perceive their
neighborhood as unsecure were 12 times more likely to
be overweight [64], in children neighborhood crime
was associated with an increase in weight and a limited
outdoor activity [65]. Next to the quality of the living
environment the only other stressor with a significant
impact on overall perceived maternal stress was a low
household income, These stressors are likely related to
a low socioeconomic status of the families, which is
Leppert et al. BMC Public Health         (2018) 18:1211 
Page 7 of 10
 known to be strongly associated with obesity in the
Western world [66, 67].
Interestingly, the stressors themselves did not have a
direct effect on girl’s BMI z-scores but rather mediated
their effect through their impact on the maternal overall
perceived stress level. As the maternal perceived stress is
most likely a cumulative account of these stressors and
potentially also covers others stress-related factors, sin-
gle stressors might not have a sufficient predictive
power. This is in line with the observation that a com-
bination of adverse effects within a family can increase
the obesity risk, whereas unfavorable social factors in
isolation often do not [68, 69].
Conclusion
In summary, with our longitudinal qualitative stress as-
sessment we were able to provide evidence for the idea
that childhood BMI trajectories develop early and that
maternal stress during the first year after birth is a per-
sistent positive predictor of BMI z-scores in girls up to
the age of five years.
To reduce the risk for childhood obesity – in particu-
lar in girls - behavioral interventions to reduce the men-
tal stress in mothers should be considered in the future.
