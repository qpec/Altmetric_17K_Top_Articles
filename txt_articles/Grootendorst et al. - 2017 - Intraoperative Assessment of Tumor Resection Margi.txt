In early-stage breast cancer, the primary treatment option for most
women is breast-conserving surgery (BCS). There is a clear need for
more accurate techniques to assess resection margins intraopera-
tively, because on average 20% of patients require further surgery to
achieve clear margins. Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) com-
bines optical and molecular imaging by detecting light emitted by
18F-FDG. Its high-resolution and small size imaging equipment make
CLI a promising technology for intraoperative margin assessment.
A first-in-human study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of
18F-FDG CLI for intraoperative assessment of tumor margins in
BCS. Methods: Twenty-two patients with invasive breast cancer re-
ceived 18F-FDG (5 MBq/kg) 45–60 min before surgery. Sentinel lymph
node biopsy was performed using an increased 99mTc-nanocolloid
activity of 150 MBq to facilitate nodal detection against the g-probe
background signal (cross-talk) from 18F-FDG. The cross-talk and
99mTc dose required was evaluated in 2 lead-in studies. Immediately
after excision, specimens were imaged intraoperatively in an investi-
gational CLI system. The first 10 patients were used to optimize the
imaging protocol; the remaining 12 patients were included in the anal-
ysis dataset. Cerenkov luminescence images from incised BCS spec-
imens were analyzed postoperatively by 2 surgeons blinded to the
histopathology results, and mean radiance and margin distance were
measured. The agreement between margin distance on CLI and his-
topathology was assessed. Radiation doses to staff were measured.
Results: Ten of the 12 patients had an elevated tumor radiance on
CLI. Mean radiance and tumor-to-background ratio were 560 6 160
photons/s/cm2/sr and 2.41 6 0.54, respectively. All 15 assessable
margins were clear on CLI and histopathology. The agreement in
margin distance and interrater agreement was good (k 5 0.81 and
0.912, respectively). Sentinel lymph nodes were successfully detected
in all patients. The radiation dose to staff was low; surgeons received
a mean dose of 34 6 15 mSv per procedure. Conclusion: Intraoper-
ative 18F-FDG CLI is a promising, low-risk technique for intraoperative
assessment of tumor margins in BCS. A randomized controlled trial
will evaluate the impact of this technique on reexcision rates.

In early-stage breast cancer, the primary treatment option for
most women is breast-conserving surgery (BCS) by wide local
excision (WLE) of the tumor. WLE often fails to achieve clear
surgical margins, and on average 20% of patients who undergo
BCS will require repeated surgery to achieve clear margins (1)
(although this may vary because there is no global agreement of
the definition of clear margins). Reoperations potentially have sev-
eral negative consequences including delayed commencement of
adjuvant therapy, worse cosmesis, increased patient anxiety, and
costs (2,3).
There have been several attempts to assess surgical margins
intraoperatively to reduce breast cancer reoperation rates after
WLE (1). Techniques evaluated to date include specimen radio-
graphy, intraoperative ultrasound, touch imprint cytology, frozen
section, and radiofrequency spectroscopy. However, these all have
limitations in terms of adequate performance, practicality, or cost-
effectiveness (1). Experimental methods evaluated include Raman
spectroscopy, ambient mass spectrometry, optical coherence to-
mography, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, confocal microscopy,
and (targeted) fluorescence imaging (1). Each of these techniques
has unique limitations, and the diagnostic performance remains to
be evaluated in large-scale studies.
PET using 18F-FDG is a powerful tool for in vivo imaging of
breast cancer. Although whole-body PET has limited diagnostic
sensitivity for primary breast cancer, high-resolution PET imaging
with positron emission mammography has shown high sensitivity
(92%–96%) and specificity (84%–91%) for breast cancer diagnosis
(4–6). Intraoperative high-resolution imaging of 18F-FDG could

 therefore provide a powerful tool for surgical guidance. However,
intraoperative PET is impractical because of the large size and
expense of a PET scanner and PET’s low spatial resolution. Devel-
opment of a compact, high-resolution, intraoperative PET scanner
could address these limitations.
Recently, it has been discovered that PET imaging agents emit
optical photons via a phenomenon called Cerenkov luminescence
(7). Cerenkov photons are generated by positrons traveling at super-
relativistic speeds in tissue. Optical imaging of Cerenkov photons
emitted by PET agents is an emerging imaging modality called
Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI). CLI combines high diag-
nostic performance and clinical translatability of PET imaging with
high spatial resolution and compactness of optical cameras, thus
making it a promising technology for intraoperative margin assess-
ment in breast cancer surgery (8).
In this first-in-human clinical trial, we evaluated the feasibility,
safety, and preliminary performance of 18F-FDG CLI using a novel
intraoperative CLI camera to assess tumor margin status in breast
cancer patients undergoing WLE with sentinel lymph node biopsy
(SLNB) or with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Intraoperative 18F-FDG CLI in BCS
Patient Recruitment and Patient Preparation on Day of Surgery.
Research Ethics Committee approval was obtained before patient
recruitment (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02037269). Between June
2014 and February 2016, patients with histologically confirmed invasive
breast cancer on core biopsy with or without associated ductal carci-
noma in situ (DCIS), due to undergo primary BCS, and SLNB or
ALND, were recruited at Guy’s Hospital in London after written in-
formed consent was obtained. Exclusion criteria were age younger than
30 y, previous surgery or radiotherapy to the ipsilateral breast in the
preceding 2 y, neoadjuvant systemic therapy, pregnancy or lactation, a
blood glucose level of 12 mmol/L or more on the day of surgery, and
known hypersensitivity to 18F-FDG. Women of childbearing age re-
quired a negative pregnancy test (by b-HCG qualitative analysis), his-
tory of surgical sterilization, or history of amenorrhea in the past 12 mo.
On the day of surgery, patients scheduled to undergo SLNB received a
periareolar intradermal injection of 150 MBq of 99mTc-albumin-nanocolloid
(Nanocoll; GE Healthcare, U.K.). The increased 99mTc activity of
150 MBq was calculated on the basis of the results from 2 lead-in
cross-talk studies (supplemental materials [available at http://jnm.
snmjournals.org]). Patients were then injected intravenously with
18F-FDG (5 MBq/kg; up to a maximum of 300 MBq), and typically
45–60 min after 18F-FDG injection they were taken to the operating
theater.
Surgery and Intraoperative Specimen Radiography
After induction of anesthesia, patients due to undergo SLNB received
a periareolar subdermal injection of 2 mL of Patent Blue V (Guerbet,
France) and 3 mL of normal saline. To minimize radiation exposure to
theater staff by reducing the time spent near the patient, a standard breast
operating set was prearranged on a sterile tray. Surgery to the breast was
performed ahead of SLNB/ALND to minimize signal intensity reduction
from radiotracer decay in the time between 18F-FDG injection and CLI.
The WLE specimen was excised using monopolar diathermy (Valleylab
Force FX electrosurgical generator [Medtronic] with HCP-01 Skintact
surgical pencil). The excised specimen was orientated with sutures and
metal surgical clips as per local protocol.
Postexcision WLE specimens were x-rayed intraoperatively (Faxitron
Bioptics), and excision of cavity shave margins was performed if
the tumor was deemed to be close to the edge of the specimen on
radiography.
After excision of the WLE specimen, SLNB or ALND was
performed. For SLNB, a Europrobe 3 g-probe with a high-energy
collimator was used (Eurorad SA). Sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were
defined as nodes that were radioactive, blue, or palpable (9). The
number of excised SLNs, the ex vivo SLN g-probe signal (counts
per second), and the presence of blue nodal discoloration were
recorded. On completion of the procedure, the g-probe background
signal in the axilla was measured.
Intraoperative CLI of WLE Specimens and Lymph Nodes
After specimen radiography, CLI of the WLE specimen was
performed using an investigational intraoperative CLI system (Light-
point Medical Ltd., U.K.). This system consists of a custom-built light-
tight dark box containing 2 optical pathways: 1 for CLI and 1 for white-
light imaging for anatomic reference (Fig. 1A). The CLI pathway
includes a fast f/.95 lens and a reflex mirror to fold the optical pathway
into an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) camera.
The field of view of the CLI camera is 8 · 8 cm, and the acquisition
matrix is 512 · 512 to give a pixel resolution of 156.25 mm. The
EMCCD is thermoelectrically cooled to 280�C and radiation-shielded
with lead to prevent annihilation photons from scintillating in the
EMCCD chip—that is, gamma strikes. The white-light imaging path-
way provides a photographic reference image using a standard comple-
mentary metal oxide semiconductor camera.
The WLE specimen was positioned on a specimen table (Fig. 1B),
the margin of interest was placed in the center of the field of view
using the surgical sutures to guide orientation, and the specimen was
subsequently imaged.
After intact WLE specimen imaging, the surface of the specimen was
immediately inked intraoperatively to preserve its orientation for
histopathologic analysis (Supplemental Fig. 1A). Six distinct ink colors
(Davidson; Bradley Products Inc., USA) were applied to the 6 margins.
The inked specimen was then incised through the posterior margin to
visualize the primary tumor and tumor margins, and the incised WLE
specimen was imaged (Supplemental Figs. 1B and 1C). In 1 patient,
sequential images over a 50-min time period were acquired to determine
the half-life of the radiance observed in the tumor.
The first 10 patients were included in the optimization dataset
and the remaining 12 patients in the analysis dataset. In the first 10
patients, the image acquisition protocol was optimized by testing
different image acquisition times (100, 300, 400 s) and pixel binning
settings (2 · 2, 4 · 4, 8 · 8). A 300-s acquisition time and 8 · 8 pixel
binning was found to provide sufficient sensitivity for tumor detection
and acceptable spatial resolution (1.25 mm) within a time window
feasible for intraoperative use, and these settings were used in the
remaining 12 patients included in the analysis dataset. On completion
of WLE CLI, the activity of the WLE specimen was estimated using a
scintillation monitor (type 41/44A; ThermoScientific, USA) or hand-
held radiation spectrometer (Raymon10 GR1; Kromek PLC). SLNs
were also imaged intraoperatively with CLI using the same imaging
settings.
After imaging was completed, WLE specimens were sent for
histopathologic analysis as per standard practice.
Radiation Safety Monitoring
Radiation safety monitoring was performed to ensure that safe work-
ing practices were maintained and that work was compliant with
U.K. legislation regarding ionizing radiation (10–12). Before commenc-
ing the study, all staff received training to become familiar with radia-
tion control procedures and occupational risks and learned how
to minimize exposure without compromising patient care. Staff mem-
bers were issued electronic personal radiation dose monitors (PDM-112
and PDM-122; Hitachi-Aloka Medical Ltd.) for the body and thermo-
stimulated luminescent ring dosimeters for extremities (Landauer).

 Radiation contamination monitoring of staff, rooms, equipment, and
waste was performed after each procedure using a scintillation monitor
(type 41/44A, Series 300 mini-monitor; ThermoScientific). Because
99mTc has a longer half-life (6.02 h) than 18F (110 min), the radioactive
waste storage requirements for CLI procedures
are similar to standard SLNB procedures. The
time taken for the various stages of the pro-
cedure, that is, from induction of anesthesia to
recovery, were recorded.
Histopathology
Histopathologic analysis was performed as
per U.K. national guidelines: the WLE specimen
was sliced at 2-mm intervals, and representa-
tive sections of the tumor and all 6 relevant
margins were selected by the pathologist,
processed, and embedded in paraffin wax,
and 3- to 4-mm sections were cut and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. Microscopic
margin distance measurements were per-
formed by a consultant breast pathologist.
Microscopic invasive tumor size and whole-
tumor size (including DCIS extending from
the main invasive mass) were also measured.
Positive margins were defined as invasive
cancer or DCIS less than 1 mm from the
specimen surface. The histologic margin distances were reported in
increments of 1 mm, but margins more than 5 mm were reported as
greater than 5 mm. The pathologist was blinded to the interpretation of
the Cerenkov luminescence images.

 Image Analysis
All Cerenkov luminescence and radiography images were analyzed
postoperatively to provide a controlled and standardized analysis
environment. Measurements of the mean radiance (photons/s/cm2/sr)
were performed by drawing regions of interest on the unprocessed
Cerenkov luminescence images. Regions of interest were selected in
areas showing increased signal intensity (tumor) and no increased
signal (tissue background). Tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) were
calculated. g-strikes were excluded from region-of-interest analysis.
The tumor radiance from the sequential incised WLE images was fit to
a monoexponential, to determine the radiance half-life.
Assessment of margin status on CLI was performed on the incised
WLE specimen images. The analysis was done independently by 2
experienced breast surgeons and performed before analysis of the
radiography images to prevent potential confirmation bias from a priori
knowledge of the radiologic margin status. Before analysis Cerenkov
luminescence images were processed by applying a median filter (filter
size range, 5–10; filter threshold range, 10–15) and gaussian filter (filter
width, 1; filter threshold, 0.5). A stronger gaussian filter (filter width, 4 or
5) was applied to images with a low TBR to increase the visibility of the
tumor. The preoperative diagnostic information that would typically be
available to the surgeon was provided including patient age; clinical,
mammographic, and ultrasound tumor size; screen detected (Y/N); and
histologic tumor type, grade, and receptor status on core biopsy. Per pa-
tient, a color image containing information on specimen orientation was
shown together with a gray-scale image and Cerenkov image. All images
were displayed on a standard computer monitor (23”, 1,920 · 1,080 pixels,
250 cd/m2 luminance). The gray-scale image was overlaid with the Cer-
enkov signal to provide a fused image containing both functional and
anatomic information. The leveling was set using the software’s default
leveling and manually adjusted based on the surgeon’s clinical judgment.
Both surgeons then independently reported whether an elevated radiance
from the tumor could be identified on CLI; in patients displaying an
elevated tumor radiance the margin distance of the margins visible in
the image was measured using the ruler function in the imaging software
(Mirada XD3; Mirada Medical). The total time required to complete
margin assessment was approximately 2 min per patient. As an exploratory
outcome measure, tumor size was also measured. On completion of the
measurements, surgeons were asked whether, given the Cerenkov lumines-
cence image, they would have performed a cavity shaving had the image
been available at the time of surgery. Surgeons also scored image quality
on a 5-point Likert scale: 1, very poor—image not interpretable; 2, poor
but interpretable; 3, fair; 4, good; 5, very good.
After Cerenkov luminescence image analy-
sis, specimen radiography image analysis was
performed on a Coronis 3MP screen (20.8”,
1,536 · 2,048 pixels, 500 cd/m2 luminance)
using standard PACS imaging software (GE
Healthcare). Surgeons were presented with
the same preoperative diagnostic information,
but the images were shown in a different order
to avoid potential sequential bias. The number
of surgical marker clips was noted, and the
reliability of specimen orientation assessed.
If the orientation was considered reliable, the
margin distance and tumor size on radiography
was measured. Whether an additional cavity
shaving would have been performed based
on the radiography image was also noted.
The final histopathology results of the
surgically excised tissue were not available
at the time of Cerenkov luminescence image
and radiography image analysis and could
therefore not bias the surgeon’s assessment.
Statistics
Weighted k coefficients (k) were calculated
to assess the agreement in margin distance be-
tween CLI and definitive histopathology and to
assess the interrater agreement between sur-
geons (irr package, version 3.2.2, R statistical
software). A k greater than 0.75 was consid-
ered good agreement (13). Agreement between
histologic tumor size and tumor size on CLI
and radiography, respectively, was assessed by
calculating the mean difference in tumor size
6 SD and intraclass correlation coefficients
(ICCs) (SPSS, version 23.0; IBM).

 histopathology results from the 12 patients included in the analysis
dataset are shown in Table 1. The mean administered 18F-FDG ac-
tivity was 295 6 18 MBq (range, 259–325 MBq). The mean time
between 18F-FDG injection and WLE excision was 86 6 26 min
(range, 50–146 min), and the mean time between 18F-FDG injec-
tion and commencement of Cerenkov luminescence image acqui-
sition was 118 6 26 min (range, 88–180 min).
Tumor margin assessment was performed on incised WLE
specimen images to allow for visualization of the tumor extent
and to avoid image artifacts created by the monopolar diathermy.
Ten of the 12 patients in the analysis dataset had elevated tumor
radiance on CLI (Table 1). The mean tumor radiance and TBR in
these 10 patients was 560 6 160 photons/s/cm2/sr (range, 308–871
photons/s/cm2/sr) and 2.41 6 0.54 (range, 1.63–3.22), respectively.
The half-life of the tumor radiance was 115.5 min, which is con-
sistent with the 109.8-min half-life of 18F. This concordance sup-
ports that the detected tumor radiance is Cerenkov luminescence
from 18F-FDG. The mean radioactivity in the WLE specimen at the
time of CLI was 90 6 48 kBq in patients with an elevated radiance,
and in the 2 patients without an elevated radiance radioactivity it
was 14 and 19 kBq, respectively.
In the 10 patients with elevated tumor radiance, a total of 60
margins could be assessed histologically, 26 margins were evaluable
on specimen radiography, and 15 margins were assessable on CLI.
Of the 45 histologic margins that were not evaluable on CLI, 40
were not in the field of view of the Cerenkov luminescence image,
and 5 could not be assessed because of migration of the specimen
orientation ink onto the margin edge, preventing optical margin
interrogation. Eighteen of the 60 histologic
margins were not assessable on specimen
radiography because of the inability to reliably
orientate the specimen on the radiography
image, and 16 margins were not in the
image field of view.
The margin distance from the 15 margins
as measured on CLI and histopathology
is shown in Table 1. Two margins mea-
sured between 1 and 5 mm on CLI and his-
topathology (Figs. 2 and 3); the remain-
ing 13 margins were greater than 5 mm
by both modalities. There was good agree-
ment between the histologic margin dis-
tance and the margin distance on CLI as
measured by both surgeon 1 and surgeon
2, respectively (k surgeon 1, 0.76; k sur-
geon 2, 0.86). The agreement in mar-
gin distance between surgeons was also
good (k 5 0.91).
Five margins could be assessed on both
CLI and specimen radiography, and all
were greater than 5 mm on both modali-
ties, as well as histologically. An example
of a CLI, radiography, and histopathology
image from a patient with greater than
5-mm resection margin widths is shown in
Figure 4.
Two patients (17%) had a positive
margin on postoperative histopathologic
analysis; both were medial margins with
DCIS less than 1 mm distant. These margins
were not visible in the Cerenkov lumines-
cence image because specimen incision had exposed only the
superior, inferior, and posterior margins; the medial margin could
therefore not be assessed.
In 8 of the 10 patients, tumor size could be measured on CLI
and compared with histopathology: the agreement is shown in
Table 1. In 2 patients, the orientation inks prevented measurement
of tumor size on CLI. Invasive tumor size showed excellent agree-
ment; mean difference for both surgeons combined was 20.84 6
2.8 mm. ICC was 0.84 and 0.81 for surgeons 1 and 2, respectively.
Whole-tumor size was underestimated on CLI; the mean differ-
ence for both surgeons combined was 24.7 6 5.0 mm. ICC was
0.65 and 0.69 for surgeons 1 and 2, respectively. Interrater agree-
ment between surgeons was excellent (ICC 5 0.97).
The agreement between invasive tumor size on histopathology and
on radiography was good; the mean difference for both surgeons
combined was 1.0 6 3.1 mm. ICC was 0.56 and 0.58 for surgeons
1 and 2, respectively. Whole-tumor size was underestimated on ra-
diography; the mean difference for both surgeons combined was
25.2 6 8.9 mm.
Cerenkov luminescence image quality in the 10 patients with
successful CLI was scored as 4.3 (range, 4–5) by both surgeons.
SLN Detection and 18F-FDG Cerenkov Lymph Node Imaging
SLNB was performed in 21 of the 22 patients; 1 patient
underwent an ALND. SLNs were successfully identified in all
21 patients. A total of 43 SLNs were removed. The average number
of SLNs per patient was 2 (range, 1–4). Two of the 21 SLNB patients
had macrometastatic SLNs.

 The mean g-probe signal of the hottest SLN per patient was
4,991 6 2,521 counts per second (range, 170–8,500). The mean
g-probe signal of the second hottest SLN was 2,505 6 2,632
counts per second (range, 50–7,368). Mean axillary background
signal, measured in 13 patients, was 192 6 70 counts per second
(range, 55–270). This signal is lower than the 18F-FDG g-probe
cross-talk measured in the lead-in study (supplemental materials)
and is mainly due to the longer time between 18F-FDG injection
and SLNB (mean, 93 6 34 min). A total of 7 nodes had a g-probe
signal below the background signal; 6 of these were blue.
This indicates the importance of using the combined technique
of radioisotope and blue dye in 18F-FDG CLI-guided breast sur-
gery, because low-uptake nodes may be missed if g-probe detec-
tion is used alone.
All SLNB procedures were performed with the monopolar
diathermy device, and due to the observed image artifact from
diathermy on CLI the SLN images were uninterpretable.
Radiation Dose to Staff
A summary of the whole-body effective radiation dose to primary
personnel from all 22 procedures is shown in Table 2. Surgeons
received the highest mean and maximum dose of 34 and 74 mSv,
respectively. The mean duration of surgery was 39 6 11 min (range,
21–61 min) during which the surgeon was
generally less than 0.5 m from the patient.
The mean radiation dose to the left and right
hand of the surgeon was 126 6 95 mSv
(range, 0–250 mSv) and 78 6 75 mSv
(range, 0–200 mSv), respectively. The mean
and maximum radiation dose received by
the anesthetist standing at approximately
1 m from the patient, with closer patient
contact at the time of induction of anes-
thesia and at the end of the procedure,
was 11 and 18 mSv, respectively. Surgical
equipment had low levels of radioactive
contamination, which was undetectable
1–3 d later. No staff members were found
to be contaminated with radioactivity af-
ter the procedures.
DISCUSSION
This first-in-human study evaluated the
feasibility of intraoperative 18F-FDG CLI
for assessing tumor margin status in pa-
tients with invasive breast cancer under-
going BCS and SLNB or ALND. Tumor
margin assessment on CLI could be per-
formed in 10 of the 12 patients in the
analysis dataset, and there was strong
agreement between CLI and definitive
histopathology on margin width. An ex-
ploratory outcome measure assessed the
correlation between tumor size on CLI
and histopathology; the size on CLI and
histopathology correlated well for inva-
sive cancer, whereas whole-tumor size
(invasive with
associated
DCIS)
was
underestimated on CLI. Results from the
radiation monitoring program demon-
strated that the procedure can be performed safely while main-
taining low radiation exposures to the staff involved.
In 2 patients, margin assessment could not be performed because
the tumors did not display elevated radiance on CLI. The absence
of signal in these patients is probably due to the small tumor size, a
factor known to be associated with lower 18F-FDG uptake (14), and
the late time points at which these tumors were imaged (135 and
180 min after 18F-FDG injection; the first and third longest injec-
tion-imaging time of all patients). Unsuccessful CLI because of the
absence of a detectable tumor signal highlights the importance of
ongoing developments focused on improving detection sensitivity
of camera systems to aid detection of tumors with low 18F-FDG
uptake including lower grade tumors and DCIS (4).
Since its discovery in 2009, CLI has rapidly emerged as a
powerful technique for cancer imaging. CLI is readily translat-
able to the clinic because of existing regulatory approval and
widespread availability of PET imaging agents (15). In contrast,
targeted fluorescence imaging requires prohibitive clinical devel-
opment times and capital investment for regulatory and reim-
bursement approval of novel imaging drugs (16). Three clinical
pilot studies of CLI have been published to date. These have
focused on the use of CLI to image radiopharmaceutical uptake
in the thyroid, CLI for noninvasive detection of nodal disease, and

 Cerenkov luminescence endoscopy to aid detection of cancerous
lesions in the gastrointestinal tract (17–19). To our knowledge,
this is the first report of intraoperative CLI. Its high-resolution,
small-size imaging equipment and minute-scale image acquisi-
tion (5 min) and image analysis (;2 min) times make CLI of
particular interest for image-guided surgery. The feasibility of
intraoperative CLI as shown in this study in combination with
the wide applicability of 18F-FDG across a range of solid cancers
provides a stepping stone for clinical evaluation of this technol-
ogy in other cancer types.
The low radiation exposure to staff found in this study is in
accordance with previously reported exposure levels from
18F-FDG–guided breast surgery procedures (20,21) and compa-
rable to the radiation dose reported for interventional cardiology
procedures (1–50 mSv) (22). The number of 18F-FDG CLI-
guided BCS procedures that could be performed in a routine
clinical setting depends on the occupational limits on radiation
exposure per country (Table 2). In the United Kingdom and
United States, the occupational annual dose limit is 20 (23)
and 50 mSv (24), respectively. Good practice would dictate that
the radiation exposure from a procedure should be kept As Low
As Reasonably Achievable, that is, well below the dose limits. In
practice in the United Kingdom, if workers are likely to receive
annually more than 6 mSv they would be designated a classified
worker, necessitating annual medical surveillance and longer
term record keeping of their radiation exposure.
Image artifacts on CLI from tissue excised with the monopolar
diathermy device prevented tumor margin assessment on intact
WLE specimens and assessment of SLNs. Although the source of
this false signal is not yet fully understood, current evidence from
preclinical experiments points toward long-lived, thermally in-
duced chemiluminescence (25). Because the emission seems to
be related to temperature, which can reach up to 250�C at the
tip of the diathermy device, electrosurgical devices that operate
at much lower temperatures are currently being tested (26). In
addition to potentially facilitating margin assessment on intact
WLE specimens, an advantage of low-temperature devices over
monopolar diathermy is the reduced collateral tissue damage,
which could also improve the accuracy of assessing tumor resec-
tion margins on histopathology (27).
Although CLI of incised WLE specimens is feasible for
assessing tumor margin status, this approach has some limitations
over margin assessment on intact specimens. First, migration of
the wet pathology ink onto the margin edge immediately after
specimen incision hinders margin interpretation with CLI. Meth-
ods to accelerate drying of inks by applying acetic acid to the
painted tissue or using fast-drying inks may be solutions to this
problem, but this has not been tested in this study. Second, in our
institution specimen incision could be performed only through
the posterior margin to ensure accurate postoperative histologic
assessment of radial margins. Consequently, only a limited num-
ber of margins could be assessed with CLI per patient, and 2
histologically positive margins that were not visible in the
Cerenkov luminescence image were therefore missed. To assess
more margins per patient specimen incision may be performed in
multiple planes, but good communication between surgeons and
pathologists is paramount to not compromise patient care.
A randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical study is scheduled
to commence in early 2017, with the first patient expected to be
recruited in February 2017, to evaluate the effect of intraoperative
18F-FDG CLI on reoperation rate and quality of life in BCS (Clin-
icalTrials.gov identifier NCT02666079). The study will run across
an anticipated 8 study sites in the United Kingdom and Germany
and use the CE-marked (CE is Conformité Européene [or European
Conformity]) LightPath Imaging System (Lightpoint Medical Ltd.,
U.K.). The smaller field of view of 6 · 6 cm and improved imaging
software may provide substantial improvements in sensitivity over
the investigational CLI camera used in the present study. By ana-
lyzing larger subgroups of patients with a range of tumor types
(including DCIS), size, histologic grades, and hormone receptor
status, further insight should be obtained into which breast cancer
patient populations may most benefit from CLI-guided surgery.

 CONCLUSION
Intraoperative 18F-FDG CLI in BCS for invasive breast carci-
noma is a promising and low-risk procedure. CLI of incised WLE
specimens provides high-resolution functional information that al-
lows surgeons to accurately assess margin status with good corre-
lation to gold-standard histopathologic examination. Further work,
focused on suppressing the optical signal from the monopolar dia-
thermy device, will assist margin assessment on intact WLE spec-
imens and potentially identification of SLN metastases on CLI.
SLNB can be performed successfully during 18F-FDG CLI-guided
surgery using 150 MBq of 99mTc-nanocolloid and blue dye. On the
basis of the results of this study, a larger randomized controlled
study is warranted to evaluate the impact of intraoperative 18F-
FDG on reoperation rate and quality of life in BCS.
