Summary
Background People who inject drugs (PWID) are a key population affected by the global HIV and hepatitis C virus 
(HCV) epidemics. HIV and HCV prevention interventions for PWID include needle and syringe programmes (NSP), 
opioid substitution therapy (OST), HIV counselling and testing, HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), and condom 
distribution programmes. We aimed to produce country-level, regional, and global estimates of coverage of NSP, 
OST, HIV testing, ART, and condom programmes for PWID.
Methods We completed searches of peer-reviewed (MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO), internet, and grey literature 
databases, and disseminated data requests via social media and targeted emails to international experts. Programme 
and survey data on each of the named interventions were collected. Programme data were used to derive country-level 
estimates of the coverage of interventions in accordance with indicators defined by WHO, UNAIDS, and the UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime. Regional and global estimates of NSP, OST, and HIV testing coverage were also calculated. 
The protocol was registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42017056558.
Findings In 2017, of 179 countries with evidence of injecting drug use, some level of NSP services were available in 
93 countries, and there were 86 countries with evidence of OST implementation. Data to estimate NSP coverage were 
available for 57 countries, and for 60 countries to estimate OST coverage. Coverage varied widely between countries, 
but was most often low according to WHO indicators (<100 needle-syringes distributed per PWID per year; <20 OST 
recipients per PWID per year). Data on HIV testing were sparser than for NSP and OST, and very few data were 
available to estimate ART access among PWID living with HIV. Globally, we estimate that there are 33 (uncertainty 
interval [UI] 21–50) needle-syringes distributed via NSP per PWID annually, and 16 (10–24) OST recipients per 
100 PWID. Less than 1% of PWID live in countries with high coverage of both NSP and OST (>200 needle-syringes 
distributed per PWID and >40 OST recipients per 100 PWID).
Interpretation Coverage of HIV and HCV prevention interventions for PWID remains poor and is likely to be 
insufficient to effectively prevent HIV and HCV transmission. Scaling up of interventions for PWID remains a crucial 
priority for halting the HIV and HCV epidemics.

Introduction
We recently estimated that 15·6 million (uncertainty 
interval [UI] 10·2–23·7 million) people inject drugs.1 The 
estimated global prevalence of HIV infection among 
people who currently inject drugs is 18% (UI 11–25), and 
more than half are hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody 
positive (52%, UI 42–62).1 Recent years have seen HIV 
outbreaks and persistently high HCV incidence among 
people who inject drugs (PWID) in a range of settings.2–4
WHO, UNAIDS, and the UN Office on Drugs and 
Crime (UNODC) supports a comprehensive package of 
interventions for the prevention and treatment of HIV 
and HCV infections among PWID. Core interventions 
include needle and syringe programmes (NSP) to 
prevent shared use of injecting equipment; opioid 
substitution therapy (OST) to reduce the frequency of 
and encourage cessation of opioid injecting; HIV 
testing and counselling as a gateway to HIV treatment 
and care; HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) to reduce 
community viral load; and condom distribution 
programmes to prevent viral transmission to sexual 
partners.5
The presence of interventions alone is not sufficient; 
the greatest prevention benefits are reported when NSP 
and OST are implemented at high coverage and in 
combination.6–8 WHO emphasises that in countries 
where injecting drug use occurs, priority should be given 
to immediate implementation of NSP and OST,9 and 
recommends that countries aim to distribute in excess of 
200 needle-syringes per PWID annually, and to provide

OST to more than 40 people per 100 PWID.5 In 2010, 
however, a comprehensive review reported very low 
coverage of all of the above interventions among PWID 
globally, noting that there were few countries where 
coverage was considered sufficient to prevent viral 
transmission.10
In 2015, the UN General Assembly adopted Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) relevant to HIV and HCV,11 
including access to drug dependence treatment; targets 
for reductions in HIV and viral hepatitis incidence 
and prevalence; and access to essential medicines, 
including medicines used in OST (namely, methadone 
and buprenorphine).11,12 Additionally, the WHO Global 
Health Sector Strategy on Viral Hepatitis 2016–2021 
includes harm reduction for PWID and HCV treatment 
as core interventions to eliminate viral hepatitis.13 There 
is clear recognition of the need to monitor progress 
towards these targets.11
Despite recognition of the need to monitor coverage, 
there is no comprehensive, regularly updated system for 
collating, critiquing, and synthesising data on coverage 
of PWID populations with these interventions. Harm 
Reduction International produces a biennial report 
documenting the existence of NSP, OST, and ART 
services for PWID;14 some data on service provision are 
presented, but not estimates of service coverage. Annual 
reporting to UNAIDS on service provision includes data 
on HIV testing and ART for PWID, but indicators 
relating to PWID are the most poorly reported of all key 
population indicators, and missing data are common.15 
As a result, the most recent source for global coverage 
data remains the review published in 2010,10 meaning 
that the data informing decisions about country-level 
responses to HIV and HCV among PWID are in many 
cases over a decade old.
There are also reasons to be concerned for the future 
of HIV and HCV service provision for PWID. The 
June, 2016, UN High Level meeting on AIDS made only 
very brief mention of insufficient coverage of services 
for this population. Funding to UNAIDS is decreasing, 
and in July, 2016, UNAIDS ceased funding for HIV 
activities to UNODC, the lead UN agency for HIV 
services among PWID. Civil society organisations have 
raised concerns regarding sustainability of global 
funding for harm reduction services.16,17 The Global Fund 
is a leading source of financial support for harm 
reduction services internationally, but has shifted way 
from funding activities in middle-income countries.17 
National government investment following Global Fund 
withdrawal from countries has often been insufficient, 
leading to declining budgets and service provision.18–20 
To monitor the ongoing impacts of these changes to the 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
In 2010, a systematic review estimated country, regional, and 
global coverage of interventions for the prevention and 
treatment of HIV among people who inject drugs (PWID), 
including needle and syringe programmes (NSP), opioid 
substitution therapy (OST), HIV testing and counselling, 
HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART), and condom distribution 
programmes. The review reported coverage of services for 
PWID to be poor across countries, with few exceptions. 
However, lack of data and poor quality data on injecting 
prevalence and service provision were notable barriers to 
accurate ascertainment of service coverage. Since 2010, 
estimates of intervention coverage have been reported by 
government and intergovernmental agencies. However, 
estimates typically come from a limited number of countries 
(eg, the European Drug Report published by the European 
Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction) or derive 
from member state reporting (eg, country progress reports 
submitted to UNAIDS). Estimates might not always comprise 
objective measurement of service provision or the size of the 
population of PWID nor reflect evidence from all available 
sources. Harm Reduction International produces a biennial 
report in which harm reduction services are summarised, but 
no estimates of service coverage are made. No global, 
systematic review of data to generate estimates of 
intervention coverage for PWID has been undertaken since 
the 2010 review.
Added value of this study
The previous review indicated that the current scale of coverage 
of the reviewed interventions was unlikely to prevent, halt, or 
reverse HIV epidemics among this population. In the intervening 
period, capacity to capture and disseminate information 
regarding access to services has been enhanced, particularly in 
low-income and middle-income countries. Furthermore, 
international public health agencies have established goals for 
reductions in prevalence, and even elimination, of HIV and viral 
hepatitis. Updated estimates of service coverage are crucial to 
monitor progress towards these targets. This Article presents 
updated estimates of national, regional, and global coverage of 
five interventions (NSP, OST, HIV testing, ART, and condom 
programmes) for the prevention and treatment of HIV and 
hepatitis C virus infections among PWID. Estimates were derived 
from a comprehensive systematic review of peer-reviewed and 
grey literature, data reported by national and intergovernmental 
agencies, and expert consultation. It presents the first global 
picture of combination coverage of the highest priority of these 
interventions, NSP and OST.
Implications of all the available evidence
Coverage of these interventions remains poor at the global 
level, and is insufficient to prevent, halt, or reverse HIV and HCV 
epidemics among PWID. Greater investment in HIV and HCV 
prevention and treatment is urgently needed for the 16 million 
PWID globally.

Methods
Reporting rationale
Reporting of this study is in accordance with PRISMA21 
and GATHER22 guidelines (appendix p 3). The protocol 
was registered on PROSPERO, number CRD42017056558.23
Search strategy and data extraction
The methods used for literature searching, screening, 
and extracting data were consistent with those adopted 
in a previous global review of intervention coverage.10 We 
searched for data on 17 indicators relating to NSP, OST, 
HIV testing, ART, and condom distribution programmes, 
selected from the WHO/UNODC/UNAIDS target 
setting guide (table 1).5 Our approach included multiple 
stages of searches of the peer-reviewed and grey 
literature to identify relevant data sources published 
from 2010 (the year of the most recent global systematic 
review of coverage data10) onwards, and international 
expert consultation to seek additional data or confirm 
data that had been collected. Searches and data 
verification commenced in September, 2016, with data 
verification ongoing until Aug 14, 2017
.
We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO 
using terms developed in consultation with a librarian 
specialising in drug and alcohol research (appendix 
p 12). Searches were done in September, 2016, and 
limited to sources published from Jan 1, 2010, onwards. 
No other restrictions were applied to the search; 
citations for papers in languages other than English 
were included.
Websites identified as sources of information on 
injecting drug use, HIV, and viral hepatitis were searched 
via their own search function or Google advanced search 
between October, 2016, and February, 2017
. Methods to 
identify and search these sources were updated for this 
review24 (appendix p 15).
Reports from relevant international agencies were 
searched, including UNAIDS (country progress reports), 
UNODC World Drug Report, the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (grant reports), and the 
European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug 
Addiction (EMCDDA; annual country reports and the 
European Drug Report). Additionally, data were requested 
via an email distribution process and social media 
posts. This comprised initial emails sent to experts or 
organisations globally, including contacts in regional and 
country offices of WHO, UNAIDS, and UNODC, with 
the request to forward emails to relevant contacts 
(appendix p 81). One member of the research team (SL) 
posted a request for data via Twitter, which was delivered 
to 5525 individual feeds.
Documents identified as potentially relevant were 
catalogued using Endnote (version X.8). Document 
screening to determine eligibility was undertaken by a 
multilingual team; members of the team could read 
English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Russian, 
Ukrainian, Chinese, and Bahasa Malaysian. Assistance 
with translation of documents in other languages was 
provided by personal contacts of the authors. Google 
Translate was used to translate documents where no 
contacts could be identified
Peer-reviewed articles and grey literature were screened 
by title (and abstract where available) by one reviewer. 
The full-text of those sources deemed likely to contain 
data relevant to the indicators was then screened by 
two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by consensus. 
All sources identified from supplementary searches were 
reviewed in full for eligibility.
Sources identified as containing information relevant 
to the indicators of interest were categorised by country. 
All UN Member States were included, as were countries 
or territories where injecting drug use has been reported,1 
or where we identified evidence that an intervention for 
PWID was being implemented. Research staff reviewed 
all data sources for a country, and the single most recent 
national data across these sources was identified for each 
indicator. In the absence of national data, the most recent 
subnational data were identified (see panel and appendix 
p 83 for decision rules). Data were entered into a 
Microsoft Excel 2016 database. Data extraction was 
reviewed for accuracy by LD, SL, or AP and any 
discrepancies were resolved by consensus.
Beginning in March, 2017, country-specific reports 
were generated listing all extracted data. These reports 
were emailed to key experts and organisations globally, 
with a request for any additional, more recent or more 
complete data (an example email and report is shown in 
the appendix p 90). These emails were frequently 
forwarded on to additional recipients. Revised or new 
indicator data provided in response to these requests 
were reviewed in full, and extracted where decision rules 
for inclusion were satisfied. New data were accepted for 
inclusion until Aug 14, 2017
.
Data analysis and reporting
We collected data that identified availability of services 
(eg, any implementation of NSP, OST, HIV testing 
and treatment of PWID, and condom distribution 
programmes targeted towards PWID); programme data 
that described service delivery (eg, number of needle-
syringes distributed by NSP in a country in a year) to 
estimate coverage; and survey data on contact with

services (eg, proportion of a sample of PWID that reported 
accessing NSP in a specified time period) to provide 
additional indicators of coverage. All unadjusted data are 
presented in the appendix (pp 93–153).
National estimates of intervention coverage were 
constructed according to the approach set out in the 
WHO/UNODC/UNAIDS Technical Guide for assessing 
access to HIV prevention interventions among PWID 
(table 1).5 Programme data (eg, number of needle-
syringes distributed per PWID per year; and number of 
people receiving OST at a specific point in time) were 
used for numerators. Adjustments made to programme 
data to ensure consistency in measurement between 
countries are shown in the panel, with full details 
provided in the appendix (p 88). Denominators for 
national estimates of NSP, OST, and HIV testing 
coverage were 2015 PWID population sizes reported by 
us elsewhere.1 Denominators for national estimates of 
ART coverage were the number of PWID living with HIV 
infection.1 National estimates for intervention coverage 
were compared with targets suggested by WHO, 
UNODC, and UNAIDS (table 1).5
To determine regional estimates of NSP coverage, we 
calculated the average number of needle-syringes 
distributed per region, weighted by country PWID 
population size. Denominators included the estimated 
population size of PWID for all countries in the region 
where injecting drug use has been reported.1 For 
countries where NSP was known to be implemented, but 
the number of needle-syringes distributed was not 
known, we assumed the same level of coverage as in 
other countries in the region. The global estimate of NSP 
coverage was developed following a similar approach to 
the regional estimates, weighting the regional estimates 
by the size of the regional population of PWID.
We calculated regional and global OST coverage with 
reference to two denominators: the number of PWID (as in 
the endorsed indicators published by WHO/UNAIDS/
UNODC),5 and the number of PWID whose main drug 
injected is opioids (hereafter primary opioid injectors).1 
Examining OST coverage specifically among primary 
opioid injectors provides additional information to 
contextualise the estimate among PWID.
The process of determining regional and global 
estimates of OST coverage among all PWID proceeded 
as for the regional and global estimates of NSP coverage. 
We determined the average number of people receiving 
OST per 100 PWID in each region, weighted by country 
PWID population size. We assumed the same level of 
coverage as in other countries in the region in those 
countries where OST is known to be implemented but 
no coverage estimate was available. The global estimate 
was determined by weighting the regional estimates by 
the size of the regional population of PWID.
To determine regional and global estimates of OST 
coverage among primary opioid injectors, we used data 
from our review on the epidemiology of injecting drug 
use.1 In that review, we presented results on the estimated 
proportion of primary opioid injectors among PWID in a 
country. To estimate the number of primary opioid 
injectors in this review, we multiplied the country 
population prevalence of injecting drug use by the 
proportion of primary opioid injectors among PWID. We 
multiplied this by the country population size, then 
95% UIs were estimated using Monte Carlo simulation 
taking 100 000 draws. We used a binomial distribution 
because the parameters of interest were proportions. 
Sample sizes were derived based on the 95% CIs and SEs 
of estimates in each country. The simulated UIs 
incorporated the uncertainty of both the injecting drug use 
prevalence and opioid injecting proportion estimates. The 
process of determining regional and global estimates of 
OST coverage among primary opioid injectors thereafter 
was as above for OST coverage estimates among PWID.

Regional estimates for HIV testing coverage among 
PWID were calculated as for NSP and OST. Where no 
data were available for a region, we did not calculate a 
regional estimate. Given the scarcity of data for this 
indicator, we did not calculate a global estimate. Regional 
and global estimates of ART and condom distribution 
programme coverage were not calculated due to the 
sparseness of the identified data.
Among countries with a coverage estimate for both 
NSP and OST, we plotted coverage levels for both 
interventions to assess the extent to which combination 
high-level coverage of OST and NSP is being 
implemented. Low, moderate, and high coverage were 
defined in accordance with targets recommended by UN 
agencies.5

“Countries with programme data” does not equate to countries with estimates for that indicator as country-level estimates were not reported where no estimate of the number of people who inject drugs was available. PWID=people who inject 
drugs. *From Mathers and colleagues.25 †From Degenhardt and colleagues.1 ‡From Mathers and colleagues.10 §The number of countries in western Europe and globally differs from previous reviews: the UK (presented as one jurisdiction in the 
previous review) is now presented separately as England, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; Croatia is now included in western Europe; Greenland is included in western Europe; Northern Mariana Islands is included in Pacific Island states and 
territories; and South Sudan is presented for the first time.

Figure 1 presents an overview of the process of reviewing 
and selecting data for inclusion in the analysis. We 
screened 218 510 documents for relevant data (5858 peer-
reviewed publications, 212 164 grey literature reports, 
379 documents from international agencies, 60 reviews 
and other documents provided by experts, and 
49 additional documents identified during preliminary 
data extraction). Data for the 17 indicators of interest 
were extracted from 212 documents to produce country-
level reports that were disseminated to experts for 
verification. An additional 56 reports and personal 
communications containing data were received following 
expert consultation; ultimately, 234 documents provided 
datapoints that were included in the analysis.
We identified evidence of NSP operating in 93 of the 
179 countries and territories where injecting drug use is 
known to occur (ie, in 52% of countries where injecting 
drug use is reported; tables 2 and 3). NSP was confirmed 
to be absent in 83 countries where injecting drug use 
occurs; we were unable to confirm the presence or absence 
of NSP in three countries where injecting drug use is 
thought to occur.
OST was confirmed to be available in 86 countries where 
injecting drug use is known to occur (48% of countries 
where injecting drug use is reported; tables 2 and 3), 
confirmed to be absent in 92 countries where injecting 
occurs, and we were unable to confirm the presence or 
absence of NSP in one country where injecting occurs. 
Methadone was the most frequently available medication 
used in OST, prescribed in 81 countries. Buprenorphine 
was prescribed for OST in 56 countries (of which 52 also 
prescribed methadone), and diamorphine was prescribed 
in seven countries (all of which also prescribed methadone 
and buprenorphine). Other forms of OST (eg, tincture of 
opium, slow-release morphine) were prescribed in 
12 countries. There were 79 countries implementing both 
NSP and OST (44% of countries where injecting drug use 
is reported).
Compared with NSP and OST, far fewer data 
were identified on HIV-testing programmes for 
PWID. There were 34 countries with evidence of such

Estimated number of people who inject drugs from Degenhardt and colleagues.1 Number of countries with data includes countries where injecting is confirmed to occur but intervention is known to not be 
implemented (ie, coverage estimate is zero); therefore number of countries with data for an intervention can exceed number of countries implementing an intervention. UI=uncertainty interval. PWID=people 
who inject drugs. NSP=needle and syringe programmes. OST=opioid substitution therapy. ERPP=estimated regional PWID population. GTP=estimate greater than parity. NK=not known.

programmes (table 2) and 17 countries that confirmed 
no targeted HIV-testing sites, but data were not 
identified for this indicator for 125 countries. No formal 
policy restrictions preventing ART access to PWID 
were identified, although several of the reviewed 
publications reported that PWID have poor access to 
ART due to discrimination and fear of criminal justice 
sanctions.14,26,27 Although ART is not formally restricted, 
data on ART access among PWID were not available for 
most (n=162) countries. There were 42 countries that 
reported 
the 
existence 
of 
condom 
distribution 
programmes for PWID (table 2), and six countries with 
reports stating that condoms were not distributed in a 
targeted manner to PWID; data were not available for 
131 countries for this indicator.
Of the 93 countries confirmed to implement NSP, data 
on the number of needle-syringes distributed per PWID 
per year was available for 75 countries, and denominator 
data were available to estimate NSP coverage in 57 of these 
countries (appendix pp 93–102). Only nine countries 
(216 500 [1%] of the global PWID population) had high 
NSP coverage (ie, distributed >200 needle-syringes per 
PWID per year; figure 2). Coverage was in the moderate 
range in 12 countries (784 000 [5%] of the global PWID 
population) and low range in 36 countries (9 434 500 [60%] 
of the global PWID population).
Data on the number of people receiving OST in a country 
were available for 72 countries, and it was possible to derive 
coverage estimates for 60 of these countries (appendix 
pp 93–102). With reference to PWID, 20 countries 
(814 500 [5%] of the global PWID population) were 
implementing high-coverage OST (figure 3). OST coverage 
was in the moderate range in six countries (806 000 [5%] of 
the global PWID population), and low in 34 countries 
(7 389 000 [47%] of the global PWID population).
Programme data on the number of PWID receiving an 
HIV test annually were available for 41 countries, and it 
was possible to estimate HIV testing coverage for 29 of 
these (appendix pp 93–102). Coverage was low in 22 of 
these countries (3 408 000 [22%] of the global PWID 
population [15 648 000]), and high in only four countries 
(194 500 [1%] of the global PWID population). Survey data 
reporting the proportion of PWID being tested for HIV 
were more common than programme data (49 countries; 
appendix p 125–31); however, representativeness of survey 
samples was often unclear. There were 13 countries 
where both programme and survey data were available; in 
eight of these, programme data reported lower (often 
substantially lower) proportions tested compared with 
survey data (appendix pp 93–102). 
Programme data on the number of PWID accessing 
ART was missing for most countries, being available for

only 17 countries (appendix pp 93–102). Completeness of 
the available data was often unclear, and estimates 
ranged from less than one ART recipient per 100 HIV-
positive PWID to greater than parity (ie, the number of 
PWID in ART was greater than the estimated number of 
current PWID). There were just seven countries with 
survey data on ART access (appendix pp 137–43), ranging 
from 5% (95% CI 4–6) of HIV-positive PWID receiving 
ART in Malaysia up to 67% (63–71) in the USA. For the 
two countries with both programme and survey data, 
coverage based on programme data was lower than that 
based on survey data (12% vs 25% in Ukraine and 
12% vs 67% in the USA).
22 countries reported data on the number of condoms 
distributed by programmes targeting PWID (usually 
operating through NSP), from which 15 estimates 
of the number of condoms distributed per PWID 
per year could be derived. In these countries, estimates 
of the number of condoms distributed annually 
per PWID ranged from <1 (UI 0–1) to 52 (35–77; 
appendix pp 144–53).
Regionally, NSP coverage was highest in Australasia 
(396 needle-syringes per PWID per year, UI 309–550) and 
western Europe (166, 118–243), and lowest in the Pacific 
Islands (no NSP), and the Middle East and north Africa 
(2, 1–4), and sub-Saharan Africa (2, 1–4; table 3). Globally, 
we estimate that there are 33 (UI 21–50) needle-syringes 
distributed per PWID per year.
At the regional level, coverage of OST among PWID 
was highest in south Asia (82 OST clients per 100 PWID, 
UI 67–greater than parity) and western Europe (64, 46–95; 
table 3). Globally, there are 16 (UI 11–25) OST recipients 
per 100 PWID. Coverage increased somewhat using the 
denominator of primary opioid injectors; we estimated 
that there are 19 (UI 13–31) OST recipients per 
100 primary opioid injectors (table 3).
There were 51 countries for which a non-zero estimate 
of the coverage of both NSP and OST were available 
(figure 4; appendix p 154), 22 of which had low coverage 
across both interventions. High coverage of both NSP 
and OST was found in only four countries (Australia, 
Austria, the Netherlands, and Norway); these countries 
collectively include just 123 000 (1%) of the estimated 
global population of PWID (15 648 000). An additional ten 
countries 
(Canada, 
Croatia, 
France, 
Luxembourg, 
Mauritius, New Zealand, Scotland, Spain, Switzerland, 
and Vietnam) had either moderate or high coverage of 
both NSP and OST (figure 4; appendix p 154). Together, 
the 14 countries that provide at least moderate coverage 
of both NSP and OST are home to 752 000 (5%) of the 
global population of PWID.
Discussion
Implementation of core interventions to prevent and 
treat HIV and HCV infections among PWID is 
occurring in a greater number of countries than in

previous years,10 but information on intervention 
coverage is often not available, and where available, 
suggests that coverage remains poor in many countries. 
NSP and OST are identified by WHO and UNAIDS as 
the highest priority of the core interventions,9 but on 
the basis of available data, only ten and 19 countries, 
respectively, are meeting suggested NSP and OST high-
coverage targets. Less than 1% of all PWID live in 
countries with high coverage of both NSP and OST. 
Compared with the other interventions reviewed, there 
were considerably fewer data available on HIV testing 
and ART access among PWID. However, where data 
were available, coverage was typically low in comparison 
with suggested targets.5
The three regions with the largest populations of 
PWID—east and southeast Asia, eastern Europe, and 
North America—were all estimated to have poor 
coverage of NSP and OST. These are all regions where 
injecting drug use is well established. HIV prevalence 
in these regions is estimated to range from 9% (UI 7–11) 
in North America to 25% (16–34) in eastern Europe, and 
HCV antibody prevalence from 50% (38–63) in east and 
southeast Asia to 65% (57–73) in eastern Europe.1 
Several countries in these regions have experienced 
recent HIV outbreaks as well as persistently high HCV 
prevalence among PWID,4,28,29 highlighting the need for 
better access to prevention interventions. Of particular 
concern, Russia (with an estimated 1·9 million PWID 
[UI 1·0–3·1], 30% [18–43] of whom are estimated to be 
living with HIV, and 69% [60–78] with HCV antibodies)1 
is the only country in the eastern European region that 
does not provide OST, and access to NSP is very limited.
Rapid scale-up of NSP and OST is urgently needed in 
regions where injecting drug use is an emerging issue, 
such as sub-Saharan Africa. Of the 37 countries in that 
region where injecting drug use has now been reported, 
only seven offer NSP, and eight OST. Coverage of 
these interventions is very low at the regional level: 
just two needle-syringes distributed per PWID per year 
(UI <1–4), and one person receiving OST per 100 PWID 
(UI <1–2). HIV prevalence among PWID in the region is 
estimated at 18% (UI 11–25), similar to the global estimate 
of 18% (11–25);1 however, HCV antibody prevalence 
is 22% (18–27), much lower than the global estimate 
of 52% (42–62).1 Increased intervention coverage will 
contribute to reduced HIV transmission and prevent

further escalation of the HCV epidemic among PWID in 
sub-Saharan Africa.
There is often considerable uncertainty around 
estimates of injecting drug use prevalence, which 
translates into uncertainty in estimates of intervention 
coverage. Methods and definitions used to calculate 
estimates of injecting drug use differ across countries 
and over time. We have avoided directly comparing these 
estimates to previously derived estimates, as differences 
in methodology and data sources might explain some 
apparent changes over time. The estimates reported here 
might differ from those of some national or regional 
reporting bodies due to differences in methodology and 
data sources included. To facilitate transparency in 
reporting, we have provided references for all datapoints 
used to generate these estimates in the appendices, as 
well as online interactive presentations of these data. We 
encourage feedback regarding the estimates via email.
Much of the indicator data reported here were derived 
from reports produced by government, inter 
governmental, 
and non-government organisations. The quality of such 
data depends largely on existing monitoring systems and 
capacity within a country to collect data in a timely and 
representative manner. Establishing and maintaining 
monitoring 
systems 
requires 
dedicated 
resources. 
Without these, reporting against defined indicators can be 
poor. Some reports provided an estimate of intervention 
coverage without the data used to inform the estimate (eg, 
an estimate of the number of needle-syringes distributed 
per PWID per year, but without the population size and 
numerator used for this calculation). We did not use such 
estimates in this review, as we were unable to assess their 
validity. Lack of transparency in reporting can easily be 
remedied by providing the data used to generate estimates 
(ie, denominator and numerator), as well as the estimates 
themselves.
Compared with NSP and OST, data for HIV testing, 
ART, and condom distribution programmes specifically 
for PWID appear less likely to be systematically and 
routinely collected and reported. This is in part due to the 
interventions being applicable to the broader population, 
but also because HIV testing and treatment programmes 
might not collect or report data on risk exposure due 
to concerns regarding stigma or criminal justice 
implications for PWID. Given the potential for negative 
consequences for the patient, WHO guidelines on ART 
programme monitoring recommend against recording 
data related to patient risk behaviours in ART registers 
(as distinct from case surveillance data).30 Without such 
data, though, it is difficult to assess the extent to which 
particularly vulnerable populations are accessing these 
interventions.
Survey data might go some way towards addressing this 
problem, but to do so, surveys must employ recruitment 
methods that minimise risk of selection bias in findings. 
Recruitment of PWID from multiple community settings 
(not solely treatment or other services), such as through 
respondent-driven sampling or structured chain referral 
methods, can minimise selection bias.31–33 In presenting 
survey data, basic parameters including the precise 
indicator that was measured, sample size responding to 
the survey item, and numerator, should be presented in 
addition to the calculated proportion and associated 
uncertainty.
Clinic exit surveys are an alternative approach to 
estimating coverage of ART and other service use 
among PWID (and other key populations) being 
considered. Clients attending clinics providing ART (or 
other interventions) could complete a short survey via a 
tablet with results being immediately transmitted to a 
secure server separate from the clinic. This could 
involve a small number of questions including services 
received, viral load, mode of transmission, and current 
behaviours (including injecting drug use). If undertaken 
at large clinics across countries, this approach would 
permit estimates of the percentage of ART clients who 
inject drugs, which could be used to generate the 
number of PWID clients at the country level.
Although we did a comprehensive, multilingual search 
for relevant data, some data might have been overlooked. 
Grey literature, such as reports from organisations 
providing services or by government departments, can be 
difficult to locate, even when published online. To address 
this, we worked directly with staff from WHO, UNAIDS, 
the Global Fund, UNODC, and EMCDDA, and contacted 
experts around the world for assistance in identifying and 
verifying data. Uncertainty can occur in interpreting 
indicator data, as they are sometimes reported without 
contextual details (eg, the time frame to which data 
referred), or such details are unclear. All extracted data 
were checked multiple times by senior team members, 
and we sought clarification from people familiar with the 
data or context (eg, local researchers, service providers, 
and staff of intergovernmental organisations) if needed. 
Data searching and verification through contact with in-
country experts continued until August, 2017, to ensure 
we included the most recent programme data possible.
We have provided regional estimates of NSP, OST, and, 
for some regions, HIV testing coverage. For countries 
where an intervention was known to be in place, but no 
programme data were available, we assumed that coverage 
in that country was the same as in other countries in the 
same region. For some countries, this might have resulted 
in overestimation or underestimation of true coverage, 
affecting the validity of the regional estimates. We suggest 
caution in interpreting the regional estimates as precise 
indications of intervention coverage; rather, we provide 
them to highlight regional differences and areas for 
particular focus for investment of resources.
In some cases, estimates for OST, HIV testing, and 
ART coverage per 100 PWID were greater than parity. 
This is likely a result of programme data categorising 
individuals as PWID on the basis of lifetime injecting 
drug use, whereas our PWID population size data refer

to recent injecting drug use. As such, our approach 
might overestimate service access among recent PWID.
Prescribing of direct-acting antiviral therapies has 
recently become an important component of HCV 
prevention and treatment efforts.34 We did not explicitly 
search for indicators relating to treatment of HCV 
infection among PWID, such as HCV testing, treatment 
uptake, or outcomes of treatment, as we judged that at 
this time, there would be very limited data available for 
estimating these indicators at the population level. 
Future iterations of this work should include indicators 
such as the number of PWID who have received HCV 
antibody and diagnostic testing, and the number with 
chronic HCV infection who have been treated and cured.
Prisons and other correctional institutions are 
important settings for HIV and HCV prevention among 
people who inject drugs. We did not report on 
intervention coverage in these settings. Previous work 
has found that few countries permit NSP in prisons.14 
OST is provided in prisons in 52 countries, although 
programmes often exist on a small scale or in a limited 
number of institutions.14 Determining coverage of HIV 
and HCV prevention interventions in prisons is 
complicated by a lack of data on the number of PWID in 
prisons. Further work to determine PWID population 
sizes and coverage of prevention interventions in prisons 
is needed to understand where gaps in HIV and HCV 
prevention might exist.
Greater investment in HIV and HCV prevention and 
treatment is urgently needed for the 16 million PWID 
globally.1 Effective interventions for HIV and HCV 
among PWID are delivered at suboptimal levels in 
almost all countries. Failure to provide interventions to 
scale ensures ongoing high prevalence and incidence of 
HIV and HCV infections among PWID, who are being 
left behind in efforts to end the HIV and HCV epidemics. 
Concerted international efforts will be required to ensure 
high coverage of interventions, particularly NSP and 
OST, is achieved and maintained.
