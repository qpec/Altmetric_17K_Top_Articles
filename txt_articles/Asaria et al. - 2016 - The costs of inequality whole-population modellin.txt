ABSTRACT
Background There are substantial socioeconomic
inequalities in both life expectancy and healthcare use in
England. In this study, we describe how these two sets
of inequalities interact by estimating the social gradient
in hospital costs across the life course.
Methods Hospital episode statistics, population and
index of multiple deprivation data were combined at
lower-layer super output area level to estimate inpatient
hospital costs for 2011/2012 by age, sex and
deprivation quintile. Survival curves were estimated for
each of the deprivation groups and used to estimate
expected annual costs and cumulative lifetime costs.
Results A steep social gradient was observed in overall
inpatient hospital admissions, with rates ranging from
31 298/100 000 population in the most affluent fifth of
areas to 43 385 in the most deprived fifth. This gradient
was steeper for emergency than for elective admissions.
The total cost associated with this inequality in 2011/
2012 was £4.8 billion. A social gradient was also
observed in the modelled lifetime costs where the lower
life expectancy was not sufficient to outweigh the higher
average costs in the more deprived populations. Lifetime
costs for women were 14% greater than for men, due
to higher costs in the reproductive years and greater life
expectancy.
Conclusions Socioeconomic inequalities result in
increased morbidity and decreased life expectancy.
Interventions to reduce inequality and improve health in
more deprived neighbourhoods have the potential to
save money for health systems not only within years but
across peoples’ entire lifetimes, despite increased costs
due to longer life expectancies.
INTRODUCTION
Healthcare systems in most high-income countries
aspire to provide equitable care, adopting the prin-
ciple of equal access to services for equal need,1
even when this is difficult to define and implement
in practice.2 Some, such as the National Health
Service (NHS) in England go further, and aim for
equal use of healthcare or even equal outcomes.3
However, health status is powerfully influenced by
socioeconomic factors, with lower income asso-
ciated with greater healthcare needs.4 So for a
system to be equitable it must de-couple use of
healthcare services from individual income and
contributions towards system costs. This is usually
achieved through social insurance schemes, or—as
in the case of the English NHS—by funding system
costs
through
progressive
income
taxation.
Through the use of such funding arrangements,
healthier people subsidise care for those who fall
ill, and more affluent sections of society subsidise
the more deprived.
There is a widespread assumption that over the
life course such systems disproportionately favour
people lower down the socioeconomic scale, in
terms of the imbalance between their contribution
to the costs of health services and their use of
those services.5 Lower socioeconomic status is
associated
with
lower
incomes,
and
therefore,
smaller income tax and social insurance contribu-
tions, but also with greater healthcare need, in par-
ticular,
the
earlier
development
of
multiple
chronic
morbidities.6
7
However,
evidence
on
actual use of services is more nuanced. More
deprived populations tend to make greater use of
unplanned
(emergency)
services
than
affluent
populations, and are slightly more likely to visit
the GP
,8 but are less likely to visit a medical spe-
cialist or to use many types of planned and pre-
ventative services.9
Most studies, to date, on the costs and use of
healthcare services by different socioeconomic
groups
have
been
cross-sectional.
This
is
an
important limitation, because morbidity and mor-
tality may have opposing impacts on lifetime
healthcare costs—greater morbidity will tend to
increase lifetime costs, whereas dying younger
will tend to reduce them. After early childhood,
average current-year healthcare costs for indivi-
duals increase throughout life, rising dramatically
from the age of 50.10 These higher healthcare
costs for poorer people in life may be partially
offset by a shorter lifespan. Alternatively, given
that the rising costs in older age are largely
driven by the onset of chronic disease, earlier
onset of these diseases in poorer populations may
simply shift the healthcare costs to younger age
groups.
Consideration of these longitudinal relationships
is necessary in order to determine the impact of
socioeconomic
factors
on
health
system
costs.
Measuring the size of this impact is important not
just to quantify the relative healthcare benefits
received by different social groups, but to under-
stand the costs borne by the health service as a con-
sequence of social inequality. In this study, we
aimed to measure the costs to the NHS of socio-
economic inequality, by estimating the lifetime
inpatient hospital costs of the whole English popu-
lation by socioeconomic status.

 METHODS
Data
This study focuses on socioeconomic differences in inpatient
hospital costs across the life course. Hospital admissions in
England are recorded in the Hospital episode statistics (HES)
data set used to reimburse hospitals for provided care. This data
set contains details on every episode of care, and a new finished
consultant episode (FCE) record is created for every new admis-
sion, and every time responsibility for the care of a patient
passes from one consultant to another. The HES FCE records
data about the patient (age, sex, place of residence) and their
hospital stay (diagnoses, procedures, length of stay). Using this
information the FCE is allocated to a healthcare resource group
(HRG), which collates hospital stays that use similar levels of
resources—this is the English version of diagnosis related groups
used in the USA. Hospitals are reimbursed by the NHS through
the payments by results (PbR) system based on the HRG,
adjusted for the specifics of the case—for example, a more com-
plicated case with longer than usual length of stay attracts add-
itional reimbursement. Reimbursement is also adjusted for local
cost variations (termed ‘market forces factors’). Costs attached
to each HRG for each year, and variations for more complex
cases, are given in the NHS national reference costs.11 Details of
how to derive costs from HES data are available in the PbR
documentation,12 and their use in health economic analysis is
discussed in Asaria et al.13 W
e use HES inpatient data for 2011/
2012 and associated reference costs in this study.
The basic geographical unit of analysis in this study is the
lower-layer super output area (LSOA). The country is divided
into 32 482 LSOAs each containing, on average, 1500 people
(range 1000–3000). Population data for 2011/2012 are taken
from Office for National Statistics (ONS) midyear population
estimates split by LSOA, sex and age (ages 0–84 in single-year
estimates, and then 85+). This data estimates the total resident
population, including homeless people and people living in
institutions. Mortality data for 2011/2012 are taken from the
ONS, split by LSOA, sex and age (ages 0–84 in 5-year age
bands, and then 85+). Area deprivation for LSOAs is measured
using the index of multiple deprivation (IMD) for 2010. The
IMD includes seven domains: (1) income; (2) employment; (3)
health deprivation and disability; (4) education skills and train-
ing; (5) barriers to housing and services; (6) crime; and (7)
living environment. These domains are combined to produce an
overall deprivation rank for each LSOA. W
e grouped LSOAs
into deprivation quintiles based on this rank ranging from Q1
(the most deprived fifth of LSOAs) to Q5 (the least deprived
fifth of LSOAs).
Analysis
W
e grouped HES inpatient data into age, sex and IMD quintile
categories. Of the 18 808 903 episodes in our 2011/2012 HES
data set, 1 659 295 episodes (8.8%) could not be grouped due
to missing data on either age, sex or LSOA of residence, and
were dropped from the analysis. W
e then calculated the total
cost for each age, sex and IMD quintile group using the HRGs
and the relevant reference costs. Market forces factors adjust-
ments were not made as we are interested in the variation in
resource use by deprivation group rather than local cost varia-
tions. W
e then inflated these costs by 8.8% to account for the
missing data (we assumed that missing data were equally distrib-
uted across all patient groups and HRGs). Finally, we divided by
the population in each age, sex and IMD quintile group using
ONS population estimates to estimate average costs for each
group:
average costage; sex; imd ¼
P hospital costsage; sex; imd�1:088
P populationage; sex; imd
W
e used these average costs to calculate the total cost associated
with inequality in 2011/2012 by comparing the costs as
observed in the data with the costs calculated, by assuming that
each individual experienced the average costs (split by age and
sex) experienced in the least deprived fifth of areas:

Next we used the mortality data to calculate mortality rates by
age, sex and IMD quintile group and used these in turn to cal-
culate survival curves for each group:

W
e used these survival curves to calculate expected cost at each
age split by sex and IMD quintile group by adjusting the average
cost for the probability of an individual from each group being
alive to incur that cost. Finally, we summed across these age
groups to get an expected lifetime cost for an individual in each
sex and IMD quintile group (assuming mortality experience and
hospital costs remained constant at 2011/2012 level):

RESULTS
Social patterning of hospital episodes
In 2011/2012, there were 11 477 435 elective episodes and
7 914 736
emergency
episodes
to
hospitals
in
England
(19 392 171 total episodes). Numbers of episodes decreased
between the ages of 0 years and 10 years in both sexes, then, for
men, increased up to the age of 70 years, before declining in the
oldest age groups, and for women, spiked sharply between ado-
lescence and the age of 40 years —reflecting admissions relating
to reproduction—before gradually increasing up to the oldest
age groups (figure 1A). For ages 0 years–60 years, there was a
clear social gradient in both sexes, with episodes increasing with
area deprivation. After the age of 60 years, this trend began to
reverse until in the over 75 years age group the most deprived
areas had the fewest episodes. The greatest gap between social
groups occurred in women during the peak reproductive years.
Figure 1B shows the rate of episodes after adjusting for the
different demographic structures of population groups. After

 early childhood, rates of hospital episodes generally increased
with age, and were higher in women than in men between the
ages of 20 years and 40 years, and higher in men after the age
of 70 years. A social gradient was again evident with a higher
rate of episodes in more deprived areas, but in the case of
episode rates, the gradient persisted across the entire age range.
This indicates that the relative fall in the number of episodes for
older age groups in more deprived areas was due to a relative
decline in population, with fewer people in deprived areas sur-
viving into old age (figure 2A).
The trends for average annual costs per head of population
(figure 1C) closely mirrored the patterns for hospital episode
rates, suggesting that costs associated with different population
groups were primarily driven by volumes of hospital usage
rather than differences in types of hospital usage across the life
course.
The social gradient in hospital episodes was evident for elect-
ive and emergency admissions, but the gaps were greater for
emergency admissions (table 1). Compared with residents in the
most affluent fifth of areas, residents of the most deprived fifth

 spectrum, with the largest cost observed in the most deprived
group (£2.2 billion). Costs were broadly similar in men and
women.
Estimates of lifetime costs
Survival curves for men and women by deprivation quintile are
shown in figure 2A. People who lived in more affluent areas
were expected to live longer than those who lived in more
deprived areas, and women were expected to live longer than
men at any given deprivation level.
Combining data on survival and average costs, we calculated
expected costs of hospital admission over the life course for
each deprivation group, assuming survival and costs remained
constant at 2011/2012 levels. Cumulative lifetime costs are
shown in figure 2B. Average lifetime costs for men ranged from
£43 358 for the most affluent group to £50 163 for the most
deprived, and the respective costs for women ranged from
£48 409 to £59 255. Overall, women had 14% higher expected
lifetime hospital costs than men, largely due to the increased
costs associated with the reproductive years, but also due to
their longer life expectancy. Despite having longer life expect-
ancy, people living in the most affluent fifth of areas had lower
lifetime hospital costs than those living in more deprived areas.
Analyses for emergency and elective admissions are presented
in the online supplementary appendix figures A1 and A2.
Results were broadly similar to those for all admissions, but
expected cumulative lifetime costs for elective episodes in men
converged and were highest for people living in the most afflu-
ent fifth of areas. Results for outpatient appointments are also
given in the online supplementary appendix figure A3. Very
similar trends were apparent to those for inpatient admissions,
with outpatient hospital use increasing with greater deprivation
level and age, and spiking for women between the ages of
20 years and 40 years.
DISCUSSION
Summary of key findings
In this study, we aimed to quantify the hospital care costs to the
NHS of socioeconomic inequality. As expected, we found that
hospital admission rates generally increased with age, and were
higher in women during the reproductive years and higher in
men at most other ages. For all ages, there was a clear socio-
economic gradient, particularly for emergency admissions, with
the rate of admissions increasing with neighbourhood depriv-
ation. The costs to the NHS associated with this inequality were
partially offset by lower life expectancy in more deprived
groups, but remained substantial: £4.8 billion per year at 2011/
2012 levels.
Strengths and limitations
This is the first study based on comprehensive whole-population
data in England to explore the relationship between lifetime
hospital costs to the NHS and socioeconomic inequality. W
e
used data at small-area level to minimise, as far as possible, the
risk of ecological fallacy that may have masked inequality at
larger and coarser geographical levels. Mortality data were used
to extrapolate the results of the analysis across the patient life-
time to allow conclusions to be drawn on both cross-sectional
and lifetime costs of inequality to the NHS.
The study is subject to several limitations. First, we did not
control for differing need for healthcare among the different
groups, and so do not make any judgements on whether the dif-
ferent levels of healthcare use are ‘fair’ or appropriate, given dif-
ferences in need. For example, it may be the case that for any
given level of morbidity, poorer patients use less healthcare than
richer patients, and hence, our estimate of the cost of inequality
to the NHS, while representing current practice, underestimates
ideal practice where patients receive equal treatment for equal
need. Second, the focus of our analysis was inpatient care, but
healthcare costs are also incurred through outpatient appoint-
ments and in primary care. In 2011/2012, inpatient costs and
primary care costs each constituted 22% of the total NHS
budget of £101.42 billion.14 In our supplementary analyses, we
found that outpatient healthcare use followed trends similar to
those for inpatient use. This suggests that our estimates repre-
sent a lower bound on the total cost of inequality to the NHS.
Third, our lifetime extrapolation assumes that hospitalisation
rates and costs observed in 2011/2012 will remain constant into
the future, and that mortality rates in 2011/2012 can be used to
predict survival rates in future years. The extrapolation also
assumes that deprivation levels are fixed over individuals’ life-
times. While these assumptions may not hold in practice we feel
they give a reasonable indication of the relative magnitudes and
directions of future trends. Fourth, the underlying population
and mortality data breakdowns that we use in this study are
truncated at 85 years of age, so mortality and hospitalisation
rates for older age groups are assumed to be constant and not to
increase further with age. Finally, while we use small-area-level
deprivation in our analysis, to fully guard against ecological
fallacy, individual-level deprivation data would be required.
Such data are not available in a form that can be linked to
health data in England. This remaining potential for ecological
fallacy is likely to bias our estimate of the costs of inequality
downwards.
Comparison with other studies
As far as we know, this is the first published analysis of the
inpatient costs of socioeconomic inequality in England. The
2010 Strategic Review of Health Inequalities (the Marmot
Review) estimated the cost of inequality to the NHS to be £5.5
billion per year,4 but the basis for this calculation and the
detailed findings were not described. ONS estimated that overall
NHS spending in 2011/12 was 25.3% higher for those in the
lowest income quintile compared with those in the highest
(spending of £1836 and £1465 respectively).15 However, this is
an estimate based only on variation in the age and sex make-up
of respondents from neighbourhoods with different levels of
deprivation. By contrast, we used comprehensive national data
to calculate the actual variation in healthcare costs by area
deprivation, and to model lifetime costs. Our approach found
that inpatient hospital costs in 2011/2012 were 31% higher for
people living in the most deprived quintile of neighbourhoods
compared with people living in the least deprived quintile
(average annual inpatient hospital costs per resident of £597
and £455, respectively). Forget et al16 modelled lifetime health-
care costs based on the population of Manitoba, finding costs
for women were 40% higher than for men. As with our study,
this gap between the sexes developed during the peak childbear-
ing years and widened at the end of life. However, while the
authors described wide variations in healthcare costs between
individuals, the contribution of socioeconomic factors was not
assessed. Finally, Hanratty et al17 modelled socioeconomic
inequalities in public expenditure on healthcare in the last year
of life in Stockholm County Council. They used individual-level
income data as their socioeconomic variable and found that
after controlling for age, sex, diagnosis group and healthcare
utilisation there was substantially greater public expenditure on
higher income patients than on lower income patients. This

 suggests that if we were able to adjust for need and to use
individual-level deprivation data in our analysis, our estimate of
the cost of inequality to the NHS would be higher.
Policy/clinical implications
Socioeconomic inequalities in the determinants of health result
in both increased morbidity and decreased life expectancy. W
e
found that the substantially higher healthcare costs accrued by
residents of deprived areas throughout their lives are only
slightly offset by their lower life expectancy. Evidence suggests
that even in a country with universal access to healthcare, more
affluent groups benefit more,8
18
19 and healthcare is not
entirely equitable. If healthcare provision were to adequately
meet need, the cost disparities we describe could be even
greater, although better prevention and early intervention could
also result in a net reduction in the costs associated with
inequality,
as
has
been
found
in
social
and
educational
interventions.20 21
Rising healthcare costs in older age are largely driven by the
onset of chronic disease, and the earlier onset of these diseases in
poorer populations shifts the healthcare costs to younger age
groups. Better primary and secondary prevention, progressively
weighted towards more deprived populations, is an obvious
response, but one that has proved hard to achieve. Anticipatory
interventions to tackle the onset of chronic conditions in
deprived
neighbourhoods
can
result
in
significant
patient
benefit,22 potentially generating net savings for the health system
in any given year, as well as across the lifetimes of these patients.
However, while there is scope for health professionals to do
more
to
tackle
health
inequalities
as
providers
and
commissioners,23 24 the root causes of these inequalities are
socioeconomic, and the healthcare system—however, equitable—
can only partially alleviate their impact.25 26 A range of recent
national social and health system programmes (eg, Health Action
Zones, the Quality and the Outcomes Framework) have been
associated with more equitable access to high-quality care,26 27
and in some cases, with improvements in educational and health
outcomes,28 29 but for the most part inequalities in health out-
comes have persisted—or have actually worsened.30–32

What is already known on this subject
▸ Poorer people tend to use more healthcare at any given age,
because they are sicker, but also tend to have shorter lives.
▸ It is not known how these two sets of inequalities interact
to produce lifetime healthcare costs for different
socioeconomic groups.
What this study adds
▸ There is a social gradient in both current and lifetime
hospital costs. Despite dying at a younger age, people from
more deprived neighbourhoods tend to require more
healthcare, and cost the National Health Service (NHS) more
over their lifetimes than people from more affluent
neighbourhoods.
▸ Socioeconomic inequality cost the NHS in England £4.8
billion in 2011/2012 as a result of excess hospital
admissions.
▸ There is a financial as well as a moral case for tackling
socioeconomic inequality: reducing socioeconomic
inequalities in health would reduce the excess morbidity of
the poor, resulting in longer lives. Our modelling suggests
that the reduction in healthcare costs resulting from
reducing morbidity among the poor would outweigh the
increase in healthcare costs resulting from their increased
longevity.
