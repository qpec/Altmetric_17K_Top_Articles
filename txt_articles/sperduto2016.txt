IMPORTANCE Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States
and worldwide. As systemic therapies improve, patients with lung cancer live longer and thus
are at increased risk for brain metastases. Understanding how prognosis varies across this
heterogeneous patient population is essential to individualize care and design future clinical
trials.
OBJECTIVE To update the current Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic Assessment
(DS-GPA) for patients with non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and brain metastases. The
DS-GPA is based on data from patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2005, and we set out
to update it by incorporating more recently reported gene and molecular alteration data for
patients with NSCLC and brain metastases. This new index is called the Lung-molGPA.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a multi-institutional retrospective database
analysis of 2186 patients diagnosed between 2006 and 2014 with NSCLC and newly
diagnosed brain metastases. The multivariable analyses took place between December 2015
and May 2016, and all prognostic factors were weighted for significance by hazard ratios.
Significant factors were included in the updated Lung-molGPA prognostic index.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome was survival. Multiple Cox regression
was used to select and weight prognostic factors in proportion to their hazard ratios. Log rank
tests were used to compare adjacent classes and to compare overall survival for
adenocarcinoma vs nonadenocarcinoma groups.
RESULTS The original DS-GPA was based on 4 factors found in 1833 patients with NSCLC and
brain metastases diagnosed between 1985 and 2005: patient age, Karnofsky Performance
Status, extracranial metastases, and number of brain metastases. The patients studied for the
creation of the DS-GPA had a median survival of 7 months from the time of initial treatment of
brain metastases. To design the updated Lung-molGPA, we analyzed data from 2186 patients
from 2006 through 2014 with NSCLC and newly diagnosed brain metastases (1521
adenocarcinoma and 665 nonadenocarcinoma). Significant prognostic factors included the
original 4 factors used in the DS-GPA index plus 2 new factors: EGFR and ALK alterations in
patients with adenocarcinoma (mutation status was not routinely tested for
nonadenocarcinoma). The overall median survival for the cohort in the present study was
12 months, and those with NSCLC-adenocarcinoma and Lung-molGPA scores of 3.5 to 4.0 had
a median survival of nearly 4 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In recent years, patient survival and physicians’ ability to
predict survival in NSCLC with brain metastases has improved significantly. The updated
Lung-molGPA incorporating gene alteration data into the DS-GPA is a user-friendly tool that
may facilitate clinical decision making and appropriate stratification of future clinical trials.

W
orldwide, in 2012, there were an estimated 1.24 mil-
lion new lung cancers and 1.1 million lung cancer–
related deaths.1 In 2016, in the United States alone,
anestimated224 000newpatientswillbediagnosedwithlung
cancer, and over 158 000 will die from the disease.2 One of the
mostfrequentandseriouscomplicationsofthisubiquitousdis-
ease is metastasis to the brain, for which lung cancer remains
the most common cause. Although there are no global or na-
tional population-based estimates on the true incidence of
brain metastases, conservative estimates are that 10% to 30%
of patients with lung cancer will develop brain metastases.3
In the past, survival after the development of brain metasta-
ses was poor and treatment often considered futile.4 With the
recent advent of molecularly targeted therapies5,6 and
immunotherapies,7,8 survival from lung cancer continues to
improve. Patients are thus at greater risk for developing late
sequelae of the disease, such as brain metastases. These trends
coupled with the wide availability of magnetic resonance
imaging suggest there will be an increasing number of pa-
tients diagnosed with brain metastases in coming years.
Extensive efforts have focused on predicting outcomes for
the extremely heterogeneous population of patients who de-
velop brain metastases. Data from 1200 patients in 3 clinical
trials performed by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
(RTOG)wereusedtogeneratetheRecursivePartitioningAnaly-
sis(RPA).9TheRPAisaprognosticindexusingpatientage,Kar-
nofsky Performance Status (KPS), control of primary tumor,
and extracranial metastases to define 3 classes of disease with
median survival ranging from 2.3 to 7.1 months.9 More re-
cently, data from a retrospective database of 3940 patients was
used to design the Diagnosis-Specific Graded Prognostic As-
sessment (DS-GPA) (available free at BrainMetGPA.com).10 A
series of GPA studies have shown that survival and the fac-
tors that predict survival vary widely by diagnosis. For lung
cancer with brain metastases, the prognostic factors signifi-
cant for survival were age, KPS, extracranial metastases, and
the number of brain metastases. Four classes of disease were
defined, with median survival ranging from 3.0 to 14.8
months.10
Our group has recently published a study on the effect of
gene alterations on survival in patients with lung cancer and
brain metastases that was based on a multi-institutional ret-
rospective database.11 That study showed that patients with
EGFR and ALK alterations have a markedly improved sur-
vival vs those without the alterations. The purpose of the pres-
ent study was to update the original DS-GPA with these
molecular data to create the new Lung-molGPA.
Methods
This study was approved by the institutional review board of
each participating institution. All participants provided their
written informed consent.
A multi-institutional retrospective database was created,
including2186patientswithNSCLC(1521adenocarcinomaand
665 nonadenocarcinoma) and newly diagnosed brain metas-
tases between 2006 and 2014. Variables considered included
the 4 used by the existing DS-GPA (patient age, KPS, extracra-
nialmetastases,andthenumberofbrainmetastases)plusgene
mutation status (EGFR, ALK, or KRAS positive), pack-years of
tobacco use, sex, race, histopathologic grade, and total vol-
ume of brain metastases. Type of treatment was not consid-
ered because the purpose of a prognostic index is to estimate
survival prior to treatment. Nonetheless, the treatment break-
down for the 1521 patients with lung adenocarcinoma was
50% stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone; 22% whole-brain
radiotherapy (WBRT); 9% WBRT + SRS; 7% surgery + SRS; 5%
surgery + WBRT; and 1% surgery + WBRT + SRS.
Multiple Cox regression was used to initially select and
weight variables to be included in the new Lung-molGPA. The
primary end point was overall survival measured from start
of brain metastasis treatment. Continuous variables were cat-
egorized to assess potential nonlinear effects. Both effect mag-
nitude(hazardratio[HR])andstatisticalsignificancewereused
to select variables. The final index was chosen on the basis of
separation of prognostic classes with respect to overall sur-
vival, distribution of patients, and simplicity. Log-rank tests
were used to compare adjacent classes as well as to compare
overall survival for adenocarcinoma vs nonadenocarcinoma
groups.
Results
The participant characteristics have been previously
published.11Themultivariablemodelusedtoselectandweight
factors in the Lung-molGPA is summarized in eTable 1 in the
Supplement. Table 1 details the median survival by DS-GPA
scoreintheoriginalstudy(1985-2005)andinthecurrentstudy
(2006-2014) for patients with NSCLC and brain metastases. In
the current study, the overall median survival rates for adeno-
carcinoma(15.2months)andnonadenocarcinoma(9.2months)
were significantly different (P < .001).
Adenocarcinoma
Patientage,KPS,presenceofextracranialmetastases,andnum-
ber of brain metastases were again confirmed to be prognos-
tic. Positive findings for EGFR and ALK were also indepen-

Key Points
Question What is the effect of molecular alterations on survival of
patients with non–small-cell lung cancer and brain metastases?
Findings In this database analysis, in addition to previously
known prognostic factors, EGFR and ALK gene alterations of the
original primary lung tumor were found to be associated with
survival. This association has been incorporated into an updated
prognostic index (Lung-molGPA).
Meaning Survival and the ability to predict survival for this
population has improved significantly, and the Lung-molGPA may
help facilitate clinical decision making and appropriate
stratification of future clinical trials.

significantly different hazard functions (unadjusted P = .03
for 1 vs 2; P < .001 for 2 vs 3; and P < .001 for 3 vs 4).
Nonadenocarcinoma
The 4 original variables were confirmed to be prognostic in the
nonadenocarcinoma cohort. Mutation status was not rou-
tinelytestedinthiscohortandthereforenotapartofthisanaly-
sis. Although HRs suggested slightly different optimal cut-
offs for age and number of brain metastases compared with
adenocarcinoma, these differences did not produce a substan-
tially better prognostic index. Therefore, we retained the same
variable weighting for the 2 cohorts, although nonadenocar-
cinoma had a maximum score of 3.0, since patients could not
receive a point for EGFR or ALK positivity. Overall survival was
lower for the 3 classes relative to adenocarcinoma, as de-
tailed in Table 1. All adjacent classes had significantly differ-
enthazardfunctions(unadjustedP < .001for1vs2;andP = .04
for 2 vs 3).
Discussion
Survival for patients with brain metastases has improved over
the past 2 decades. In our updated Lung-molGPA, median sur-
vival now ranges from 3.0 to 46.8 months. The DS-GPA has un-
veiled nuances in management not previously appreciated:
(1) recent secondary analyses applying the DS-GPA to land-
mark randomized trials showed that patients with good
DS-PGA prognosis (score >3) achieved a survival benefit with
the addition of WBRT to SRS12,13 contrary to the current clini-
cal trend to avoid WBRT; (2) The survival benefit of ALK al-
terations found by the Lung-molGPA has been reported by
others14; and (3) contrary to the findings of a study that did not
use the DS-GPA,15 the number of brain metastases is a prog-
nostic factor in terms of survival. Accurate prognosis is a vital
factor to inform patients, their families, and their physicians
when making often difficult cancer treatment decisions.
Limitations
the study has some limitations. The data are retrospective with
inherentselectionbias,sotheycannotbeusedtoconcludethat
one treatment is better than another. Also, the type, timing,
combination, and sequence of chemotherapy and targeted
therapies, both before and after the diagnosis of brain metas-
tases, varied widely thus precluding the ability to assess the
effect of these agents on the study patients.
Conclusions
The updated Lung-molGPA defined in the present study was
associatedwithimprovedprognosticabilityovertheRTOGRPA
and the original DS-GPA by incorporating the effect of EGFR
and ALK gene alterations on survival in patients with NSCLC
and brain metastases. The Lung-molGPA is a user-friendly tool
that may facilitate clinical decision making and better design
and stratification for future clinical trials in this heteroge-
neous patient population.
