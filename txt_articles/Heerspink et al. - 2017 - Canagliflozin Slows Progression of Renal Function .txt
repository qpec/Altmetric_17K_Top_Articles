ABSTRACT
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition with canagliflozin decreases HbA1c, body weight, BP, and
albuminuria, implying that canagliflozin confers renoprotection. We determined whether canagliflozin
decreases albuminuria and reduces renal function decline independently of its glycemic effects in a
secondary analysis of a clinical trial in 1450 patients with type 2 diabetes receiving metformin and randomly
assigned to either once-daily canagliflozin 100 mg, canagliflozin 300 mg, or glimepiride uptitrated to 6–8 mg.
End points were annual change in eGFR and albuminuria over 2 years of follow-up. Glimepiride, canagliflozin
100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg groups had eGFR declines of 3.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95%
confidence interval [95% CI], 2.8 to 3.8), 0.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI, 0.0 to 1.0), and
0.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI, 0.4 to 1.4), respectively (P,0.01 for each canagliflozin group
versus glimepiride). In the subgroup of patients with baseline urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio $30 mg/g,
urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio decreased more with canagliflozin 100 mg (31.7%; 95% CI, 8.6% to
48.9%; P=0.01) or canagliflozin 300 mg (49.3%; 95% CI, 31.9% to 62.2%; P,0.001) than with glimepiride.
Patients receiving glimepiride, canagliflozin 100 mg, or canagliflozin 300 mg had reductions in HbA1c of
0.81%, 0.82%, and 0.93%, respectively, at 1 year and 0.55%, 0.65%, and 0.74%, respectively, at 2 years. In
conclusion, canagliflozin 100 or 300 mg/d, compared with glimepiride, slowed the progression of renal
disease over 2 years in patients with type 2 diabetes, and canagliflozin may confer renoprotective effects
independently of its glycemic effects.

Many patients with type 2 diabetes present with
hyperglycemia, hypertension, and excess weight,
and develop increased albuminuria, all of which
increase the risk of micro- and macrovascular
complications. Current practice guidelines recom-
mend targeting these risk factors with a range of
different drugs.1 However, despite the many drugs
used, many patients do not reach treatment targets
and develop potentially preventable micro- and
macrovascular complications.
Emerging interest in the role of the kidney in
glucose homeostasis has led to the development of
sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors.2 These
drugs are designed to inhibit sodium-glucose co-
transporter 2 (SGLT2), which is located in the S1
segment of the proximal tubule. Previous phase 2
and phase 3 studies have shown that administration
of SGLT2 inhibitors augments urinary glucose and
sodium excretion and decreases glycated hemoglo-
bin A1c (HbA1c), body weight, and BP in patients
with type 2 diabetes.3,4 Moreover, reductions in al-
buminuria have been observed after administration
of SGLT2 inhibitors.5,6

 The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on multiple
cardiovascular and renal risk parameters suggest that SGLT2
inhibitors may confer cardiovascular and renal protection. A
recent large clinical trial of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin
demonstrated marked reductions in cardiovascular morbidity
and mortality and suggested possible renoprotective effects.7,8
Whether SGLT2 inhibition slows the progression of kidney
function decline independent of its glucose-lowering effect,
however, is unknown.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether
SGLT2 inhibition decreases albuminuria and slows the pro-
gression of kidney function decline independent of glycemic
control by analyzing 2 years of data from a randomized
controlled trial comparing canagliflozin and glimepiride.3
RESULTS
The study ran from August 28, 2009 until January 30, 2013. As
previously reported, 482 patients were assigned to glimepiride,
483 to canagliflozin 100 mg, and 485 to canagliflozin 300 mg.
A total of 1161 patients (80.1%) completed the 104-week,
double-blind treatment period. At baseline, 230 (15.9%)
patients had a urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR)
$30 mg/g. The baseline demographics, clinical and biochem-
ical characteristics, and concomitant medications were similar
between the three treatment groups, both in the overall
population as well as in the subgroup of patients with
UACR$30 mg/g (Table 1).
The annual slope ofeGFRdecline was 3.3 ml/minper 1.73m2
per year (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.8 to 3.8) in the
glimepiride group, 0.5 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI,
0.0 to 1.0) in the canagliflozin 100 mg group (P,0.001 versus
glimepiride; Figure 1A), and 0.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year
(95% CI, 0.4 to 1.4) in the canagliflozin 300 mg group
(P=0.002 versus glimepiride; Figure 1A). Repeated measures
analysis showed a least squares mean change in eGFR from
baseline of 25.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (95% CI, 26.2 to
24.5) in the glimepiride group versus 22.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(95% CI, 23.5 to 21.9) and 23.9 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (95%
CI, 24.7 to 23.0) in the canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg groups,
respectively (Figure 1A). The eGFR decline was also signifi-
cantly lower with canagliflozin 100 and 300 mg compared with
glimepiride in the subgroup of patients with UACR$30 mg/g at
baseline (Figure 1B). A sensitivity analysis was conducted us-
ing the 4-week follow-up visit (i.e., the first postrandomization
visit where eGFR was measured) as a baseline to assess the
effect of the acute eGFR outcome of canagliflozin on the
subsequent eGFR slope. In the glimepiride group eGFR de-
cline was 22.7 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI, 23.3
to 22.1), 0.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI, 20.5
to 0.6) in the canagliflozin 100 mg group (P,0.001 versus
glimepiride), and 0.1 ml/min per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI,
20.5 to 0.6) in the canagliflozin 300 mg group (P,0.001
versus glimepiride).
In the overall population, the 30% eGFR decline end point
wasobserved in 46 (9.7%) patients intheglimepiride group,32
(6.7%) in the canagliflozin 100 mg group (hazard ratio, 0.66;
95% CI, 0.42 to 1.04; P=0.07), and 43 (9.0%) patients in the
canagliflozin 300 mg group (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.62
to 1.42; P=0.75; Figure 2). In the subgroup of patients with
UACR$30 mg/g, the hazard ratios for the 30% eGFR decline
end point were 0.37 (95% CI, 0.15 to 0.90; P=0.03) and 0.69
(95% CI, 0.33 to 1.45; P=0.33) for the canagliflozin 100 and
300 mg groups, respectively, compared with glimepiride.
UACR progressively increased over time in the glimepiride
group, remained stable in the canagliflozin 100 mg group, and
decreased in the canagliflozin 300 mg group in the first year,
and then returned to baseline at 2 years (Figure 3A). Relative to
glimepiride, canagliflozin 100 mg decreased UACR by 5.7%
(95% CI, 22.3 to 13.1; P=0.16) and canagliflozin 300 mg de-
creased UACR by 11.2% (95% CI, 3.6 to 18.3; P,0.01). In the
subgroup of patients with UACR$30 mg/g, canagliflozin
100 and 300 mg significantly decreased UACR over time, by
Table 1.

31.9 to 62.2; P,0.001), respectively, relative to glimepiride
(Figure 3B). Effects of canagliflozin on UACR were consistent
regardless of baseline angiotensin-converting enzyme in-
hibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker use (Supplemental
Table 1).
Reductions in HbA1c with glimepiride, canagliflozin
100 mg, and canagliflozin 300 mg were 0.81%, 0.82%, and 0.93%,
respectively,at1year,and0.55%,0.65%,and0.74%,respectively,
at2years. ChangesinsystolicBPwithglimepiride,canagliflozin

and 24.6 mmHg, respectively, at 1 year, and 1.7 mmHg,
22.0 mmHg, and 23.1 mmHg, respectively, at 2 years.
Adjusting the treatment effects of canagliflozin
on albuminuria for the differences in
HbA1c reductions at 1 and 2 years did not
alter the results, nor did adjustment for
changes in systolic BP or body weight, or
the combined changes in HbA1c, systolic
BP, and body weight (Table 2).
With respect to safety, similar propor-
tions of patients across treatment groups
experienced adverse events potentially
related to kidney function (Table 3). Five pa-
tients, all in the canagliflozin groups, expe-
rienced an acute renal failure (ARF) or renal
failure event. Four of these events were
asymptomatic decreases in eGFR that re-
covered or resolved. One patient, in whom
a serious adverse ARF event was reported,
died and autopsy revealed a massive pulmo-
nary embolism as a cause of death.
DISCUSSION
This analysis of 2 years of follow-up data
from a randomized controlled trial com-
paring treatment with the SGLT2 inhibitor
canagliflozin to glimepiride showed that
canagliflozin slows the progression of kid-
ney function decline in patients with type 2
diabetes who are already receiving metfor-
min. In addition, canagliflozin 300 mg
significantly decreases albuminuria, partic-
ularly in people with increased urinary
albumin excretion. The beneficial effects
of canagliflozin on kidney function and
albuminuria are unlikely to be explained by
the modest differential effect on glucose
levels, so these findings suggest that SGLT2
inhibitors may be renoprotective, indepen-
dent of their effects on glycemic control.
As a result of the use of an active com-
parator arm (glimepiride) in this study, the
differences in HbA1c during the trial were modest, and
adjustment for changes in HbA1c, BP, and body weight did
not alter the results. Although improved glycemic control has
been proventobeanimportant methodfor reducing theriskof
microvascular complications in patients with type 1 and type 2
diabetes on the basis of data from a number of trials,9–11 these
and other trials were not able to show any differences in av-
erage kidney function between the treatment arms, despite
substantial differences in glycemic control throughout the tri-
als.12,13 In this study, canagliflozin is superior to glimepiride in
preserving kidney function, as defined by eGFR levels, despite
smaller between-group differences in glycemic control com-
pared with previous placebo-controlled studies.

 The magnitude of the reduction in albuminuria with
canagliflozin relative to glimepiride was also similar to that
previouslydescribedwithotherSGLT2inhibitors,ascompared
with placebo. In patients with type 2 diabetes and CKD,
empagliflozin decreased albuminuria by approximately 30%,
whereas dapagliflozin decreased albuminuria by 33% com-
pared with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes and micro-
or macroalbuminuria treated with an angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker.6,14 The
albuminuria reduction achieved by empagliflozin was com-
pletely reversible 4 weeks after treatment discontinuation,
which suggests that albuminuria reduction is mediated

 through changes in renal hemodynamics.6 The consistency in
results between these studies and the present analysis strongly
supports the concept that the reduction in albuminuria has a
predominantly glucose-independent mechanism.
What could be the underlying mechanism of any renopro-
tective effects? Blockade of the SGLT2 transporter inhibits
sodium and glucose reabsorption. As a result, the delivery of
glucose and sodium is increased in the distal tubule and the
juxtaglomerular apparatus, which is sensed as an increase in
glomerular perfusion. This leads to a feedback signal that
causes afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction, an acute fall in
glomerular perfusion and pressure, as well as a diminished
extracellular plasma volume and BP.15 Additionally, these ef-
fects reduce atrial natriuretic peptide secretion that may also
be important in reducing intraglomerular pressure.16,17 These
effects are clinically manifested as acute reductions in albu-
minuria and eGFR, followed by stabilization in eGFR in the
longer term, and these effects are not observed with other
classes of glucose-lowering agents. Thus, SGLT2 inhibitors
specifically alter renal hemodynamics and reduce intraglo-
merular pressure, which could be expected to translate into
improved long-term kidney outcomes.
Meta-analyses of large clinical trials have suggested that a
30% reduction in albuminuria might translate into a 30%
reduction in the risk of ESRD, assuming no changes in other
markers of kidney disease.18 The effects on eGFR in this study
were also similar to those in the placebo-controlled EMPA-REG
outcomes trial, where a 55% relative reduction in the risk
of ESRD has been reported in a post hoc analysis, albeit with a
limited number of ESRD cases.8 These supportive findings will
be definitively tested in the ongoing Canagliflozin and Renal
Events in Diabetes with Established Nephropathy Clinical
Evaluation (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02065791) trial,
which is designed to assess whether canagliflozin 100 mg de-
lays or prevents kidney failure or cardiovascular death in pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes and established nephropathy.

 This study has several limitations. It was not designed nor
powered to compare the renoprotective effects of canagliflozin
versus glimepiride, so the results should be interpreted as
hypothesis-generating. Unfortunately, eGFR was not measured
afterdrugdiscontinuationinordertoverifywhethertheinitialfall
ineGFRinthecanagliflozingroupswasreversible.However,other
studies with SGLT2 inhibitors have shown that eGFR returns to
baselinevaluesafterdrugdiscontinuation.6,19Inaddition,thelack
of a placebo arm in this study means that no definitive conclu-
sions can be drawn regarding whether canagliflozin is renopro-
tective or whether glimepiride worsens the progression of kidney
disease. The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax
and Diamicron MRControlled Evaluation trial showed that low-
ering HbA1c with a sulfonylurea derivative–based regimen con-
fers renoprotection, suggesting that sulfonylurea derivatives do
not accelerate kidney function decline.20 We note, however, that
the rate of eGFR decline in the glimepiride group is higher than
what could be expected in a population with preserved kidney
function and normoalbuminuria, which may offer an alternative
explanation for the beneficial effects of canagliflozin. Also, the
effects on albuminuria were particularly marked in people with
higher UACR levels at baseline, and were smaller in those with
normal UACR levels. This is perhaps not surprising, as individuals
with high UACR are more likely to show a reduction in albumin-
uria compared with people in whom albuminuria levels are al-
ready low. Moreover, 61% of all patients received background
renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition. Whether the benefi-
cial effects of canagliflozin remain present if all patients receive
optimal doses of RAS inhibition remains to be studied, but is
likely, since our data showed that the effects of canagliflozin were
present regardless of the use of background RAS inhibition. The
eGFRcourse indicates a two-slope model of an acute fall in eGFR,
observed after 4 weeks, followed by an attenuation of long-term
eGFR decline. eGFR slopes were calculated from baseline in the
main analyses instead of using the week-4 eGFR data as baseline
to avoid violation of the randomization principle. Finally, eGFR
decline was slightly higher with canagliflozin 300 mg versus 100 mg.
This may be explained by the larger acute eGFR effects of the
300 mg dose and may also explain why the larger albuminuria
reduction in the canagliflozin 300 mg group did not correspond
with less kidney function decline.21,22 A longer follow-up period
would be required to completely characterize the effects of
canagliflozin on long-term kidney function decline.
In conclusion, in patients with type 2 diabetes, canagliflozin
100 and 300 mg as add-on to metformin slows the progression of
disease compared with glimepiride during 2 years of follow-up.
Therefore, canagliflozin may offer a novel therapeutic option for
patientswithtype2diabeteswhoareatahighriskofkidneyfailure.
CONCISE METHODS
Study Design and Participants
The study design has been published previously.3 In short, this ran-
domized, double-blind, active-controlled trial was conducted in
157 research centers in 19 countries. The study consisted of a 2-week,
single-blind, placebo run-in period; a 52-week, double-blind, core
treatment period; and a 52-week, prespecified, double-blind, exten-
sion treatment period during which patients continued their origi-
nally assigned treatment. The 52-week, double-blind, extension
period was prespecified to provide a more complete characterization
of the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin over 104 weeks of treatment.
The prespecified primary efficacy end point was the change in HbA1c
from baseline to week 52. The sample size calculation assumed that
277 patients per group would be needed to provide approximately
90% power to show noninferiority of canagliflozin compared with
glimepiride for the lowering of HbA1c, with an assumed between-
group difference of 0.0% and an SD of 1.0. The primary efficacy
results showed that canagliflozin 100 mg was noninferior to
glimepiride in reducing HbA1c whereas canagliflozin 300 mg was superior
to glimepiride.3 Eligible patients were between 18 and 80 years of age
and had type 2 diabetes with an HbA1c between 7.0% and 9.5% while
receiving metformin $2000 mg/d (or $1500 mg/d if higher doses
were not tolerated). Patients with an eGFR of ,55 ml/min per 1.73 m2
(or ,60ml/min per1.73m2 if based on restriction of metformin use in
the local label) or serum creatinine concentrations $124 mmol/L for
men and $115 mmol/L for women were excluded. No inclusion or
exclusion criteria were specified for albuminuria. Glimepiride was
uptitrated if patients met protocol-specified glycemic criteria after
$2 weeks at the current dose, and uptitration could occur at any
time during the study; patients receiving canagliflozin were mock up-
titrated. Glycemic rescue therapy was initiated with pioglitazone
(where approved) for patients who were at the maximum level of study
drug titration and met prespecified glycemic criteria.
The trial was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and good clinical practice guidelines. Ethics committees and
institutional review boards approved the research protocol. All patients
provided written informed consent before entering the trial. The study
was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT00968812).
Randomization and Masking
During the run-in period, all patients received single-blind placebo
capsules matching the study drug once daily. After the run-in period,
patients were stratified according to whether they were taking a stable,
protocol-defineddoseofmetforminbeforescreeningversuswhether they

in period or had discontinued use of a second glucose-lowering drug.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral, once-daily glimepiride
(uptitrated to 6 or 8 mg/d based on the maximum approved dose in the
countryoftheinvestigationalsite),canagliflozin100mg/d,orcanagliflozin

sponsor. Patients and all study personnel (except the safety monitoring
committee) were masked to treatment allocation. To allow for masked
increasesordecreasesintheglimepiridedosethroughoutthedouble-blind
treatment, study drugs were supplied in five levels (levels 1–5).
Procedures
After randomization, patients collected first morning void urine at
baseline and weeks 12, 26, 52, 78, and 104 for assessment of UACR.
Urine albumin was measured by a nephelometric assay and creatinine

 was measured by a rate-blanked colorimetric assay in a central laboratory
(Covance [Indianapolis, IN; Meyrin-Geneva, Switzerland; Singapore]).
Serum creatinine and HbA1c were measured at baseline and weeks 4, 12,
18(HbA1conly),26,36, 44,52, 64,78,88, and104.Serum creatininewas
used to calculate eGFR with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
equation: eGFR = 1753(serum creatinine [mg/dl])21.1543(age
[years])20.2033(0.742 if female)3(1.212 if black).21
Safety was monitored throughout the study by assessing adverse
events, laboratory data, vital sign measurements, physical examina-
tions, self-monitoring of blood glucose, and 12-lead electrocardio-
grams. Reported adverse events were recorded during the trial and
analyzed with a standard coding dictionary (Medical Dictionary for
Regulatory Activities) to classify adverse event terms. Serious adverse
events were defined as any adverse event that resulted in death, was
immediately life-threatening, required hospital admission or pro-
longed existing hospitalization, resulted in persistent or significant
disability or incapacity, was a birth defect, or was an event that
jeopardized the patient’s health or required intervention.
Outcomes
The main efficacy end point for this post hoc analysis was the yearly
rate of eGFR decline over the 104 weeks of follow-up. Exploratory
efficacy end points were the least squares mean change from baseline
in eGFR and UACR to week 104. The effects on eGFR and UACR were
assessed by comparing mean levels across the treatment period and by
assessing the number of individuals who developed a 30% or 40%
reduction in eGFR during the study period, as recommended in a
recent National Kidney Foundation–sponsored workshop.22 The ef-
fect of the interventions on these end points was assessed in the over-
all population and in a subgroup that was defined by baseline
UACR$30 mg/g (n=230). Since all patients had a baseline eGFR
.55 ml/min per 1.73 m2, eGFR subgroups were not examined.
Statistical Analyses
Differences in eGFR and UACR between randomized groups during follow-
up were estimated from repeated measures analysis. Differences between
randomized groups in eGFR decline during follow-up were estimated
from a mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM). The model
included treatment, visit (expressed in time in years since randomization),
andtreatment-by-visitinteractionasfactors.Thelatterwasusedtoestimate
the overall between-group difference in eGFR over the course of the study.
The MMRM model was also used to calculate the least squares mean
change from baseline in eGFR and UACR over time. For these analyses,
baseline eGFR and UACR were entered as covariates in the model. UACR
waslog-transformedbeforeentering intheMMRManalysistoalleviatethe
skewness of the data. To allow generality for the covariance structure for
repeated measures, the variance-covariance matrix was assumed to be un-
structured (i.e., purely data-dependent). In the MMRM model, all patients
and all data points were included. No patients were excluded due to
missing data and no imputation was carried out for missing data.
The effects of randomized treatment on the 30% or 40% eGFR
decline end points were estimated from Cox proportional hazard
models. Coxproportional hazard models were conducted on the basis
of the intention to treat principle. For patients who experienced more
than one event during follow-up, survival time to the first 30% or 40%
eGFR decline end point was used in each analysis. Patients were
censored at their date of death or, for those still alive at the end of
follow-up,thedateoftheirlastclinicvisitbeforetheterminationofthis
study arm. Patients with unknown vital status were censored when they
were last known to be alive. A P value ,0.05 (two-sided) was considered
to indicate a statistically significant difference. Analyses were performed
using SAS 9.2 for Windows (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
