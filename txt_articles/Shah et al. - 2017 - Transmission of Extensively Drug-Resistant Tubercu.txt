Abstract
BACKGROUND—Drug-resistant tuberculosis threatens recent gains in the treatment of 
tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection worldwide. A widespread 
epidemic of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis is occurring in South Africa, where 
cases have increased substantially since 2002. The factors driving this rapid increase have not been 
fully elucidated, but such knowledge is needed to guide public health interventions.
METHODS—We conducted a prospective study involving 404 participants in KwaZulu-Natal 
Province, South Africa, with a diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis between 2011 and 2014. Interviews 
and medical-record reviews were used to elicit information on the participants’ history of 
tuberculosis and HIV infection, hospitalizations, and social networks. Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
isolates underwent insertion sequence (IS)6110 restriction-fragment– length polymorphism 
analysis, targeted gene sequencing, and whole-genome sequencing. We used clinical and 
genotypic case definitions to calculate the proportion of cases of XDR tuberculosis that were due 
to inadequate treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (i.e., acquired resistance) 
versus those that were due to transmission (i.e., transmitted resistance). We used social-network 
analysis to identify community and hospital locations of transmission.

 RESULTS—Of the 404 participants, 311 (77%) had HIV infection; the median CD4+ count was 
340 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 117 to 431). A total of 280 participants (69%) 
had never received treatment for MDR tuberculosis. Genotypic analysis in 386 participants 
revealed that 323 (84%) belonged to 1 of 31 clusters. Clusters ranged from 2 to 14 participants, 
except for 1 large cluster of 212 participants (55%) with a LAM4/KZN strain. Person-to-person or 
hospital-based epidemiologic links were identified in 123 of 404 participants (30%).
CONCLUSIONS—The majority of cases of XDR tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, 
an area with a high tuberculosis burden, were probably due to transmission rather than to 
inadequate treatment of MDR tuberculosis. These data suggest that control of the epidemic of 
drug-resistant tuberculosis requires an increased focus on interrupting transmission. (Funded by 
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and others.)
Drug-resistant tuberculosis is a major global epidemic, with a half million cases occurring 
each year.1 Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis — the most severe form of drug 
resistance — has been reported worldwide and involves resistance to at least four first-line 
and second-line drugs for tuberculosis. This high degree of resistance severely limits 
treatment options, necessitating the use of complex, toxic, and costly regimens. Rates of 
treatment success are less than 40% in most patient populations, and rates of death are 50 to 
80%.2–6
Drug-resistant tuberculosis has traditionally been thought to develop as a result of selection 
pressure that occurs with inadequate treatment of tuberculosis, incomplete adherence to 
treatment, or subtherapeutic drug levels (“acquired resistance”). The high degree of 
resistance in XDR tuberculosis can develop only after multiple episodes of ineffective 
treatment, including the use of second-line drugs for multidrug-resistant (MDR) 
tuberculosis. However, XDR tuberculosis may also be caused by direct infection with a 
resistant strain. Transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains (“transmitted resistance”) 
has been well described throughout the world.6–11
Although treatment for XDR tuberculosis does not differ according to its cause, 
interventions to prevent acquired versus transmitted disease differ. Acquired drug resistance 
can be reduced by providing effective treatment and ensuring completion of treatment. 
Halting transmission requires identifying and separating infectious patients, improving 
ventilation in congregate settings, and promptly initiating of effective treatment. Given the 
extremely high mortality associated with this disease, especially among patients with human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection, prevention of XDR tuberculosis is critical. Yet, 
few studies have quantified the proportion of cases that are due to transmission, and data 
from geographic areas where HIV infection is highly prevalent are lacking.
South Africa has one of the highest burdens of tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis 
in the world. In the past decade, the number of cases of XDR tuberculosis has increased by a 
factor of 10, to more than 1500 cases in 2012.12 Compounding the tuberculosis epidemic is 
the concurrent epidemic of HIV infection; rates of coinfection exceed 70%, and rates of 
long-term survival among patients with XDR tuberculosis and HIV infection are less than 
20%.2 In this study, we sought to quantify the role of transmission and to elucidate how and 
where transmission is occurring. We combined traditional epidemiologic tools with social-

 network, geospatial, and genotyping methods to describe population-level transmission of 
XDR tuberculosis.
Methods
Patient Population
We conducted a prospective study involving patients with a diagnosis of culture-confirmed 
XDR tuberculosis between 2011 and 2014 in KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. 
KwaZulu-Natal has a population of 10.3 million persons, the majority of whom live in rural 
areas. The province has nearly half the XDR tuberculosis burden and, according to two 
reports from the government of South Africa, the highest rates of tuberculosis (1076 cases 
per 100,000 population) and HIV infection (prevalence, 16.9%) in South Africa.13,14
A single provincial referral laboratory conducts all drug-susceptibility testing. During the 
study period, drug-susceptibility testing was recommended for patients with newly 
diagnosed tuberculosis who did not have a response after 2 months of treatment, patients 
with recurrent tuberculosis, and patients with rifampin resistance detected with the use of the 
Xpert MTB/RIF assay.
Study Design and Oversight
We recruited all persons with newly diagnosed XDR tuberculosis who were residing in 
KwaZulu-Natal. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or from the 
next of kin of deceased or severely ill participants. Interviewers collected information about 
the participants’ sociodemographic characteristics and history of tuberculosis and HIV 
infection, as well as the location and duration (month and year) of hospitalizations in the 
preceding 5 years.
Participants were asked to name contacts at home and work with the use of structured social-
network questionnaires15,16 and to state whether each contact currently or previously had 
tuberculosis or XDR tuberculosis. Participants were asked to enumerate community 
locations where they spent 2 or more hours per week and contacts at those sites. A global-
positioning-system coordinate for each participant’s home was obtained and was plotted 
with the use of ArcGIS software.
Participants with unknown HIV status were offered HIV testing and were referred for care if 
the results were positive for HIV. CD4+ cell counts and viral loads were tested in 
participants with HIV infection. Medical records were obtained from the diagnosing facility 
and any tuberculosis specialty hospitals where the participant had been admitted. Records 
were reviewed for previous treatment with any antituberculosis medication — including for 
indications other than tuberculosis — and previous results of drug-susceptibility testing.
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of Emory University, Albert 
Einstein College of Medicine, and the University of KwaZulu-Natal and by the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention.

 Laboratory Methods
A diagnostic XDR tuberculosis isolate was obtained from all participants. Isolates 
underwent insertion sequence (IS)6110 restriction-fragment–length polymorphism (RFLP) 
genotyping and targeted sequencing of eight resistance-conferring regions for rifampin, 
isoniazid, pyrazinamide, fluoroquinolones, and second-line injectable drugs. These regions 
were rpoB, katG, inhA, pncA, gyrA, rpsL, rrs, and gidB.17 A subset of 298 isolates 
underwent paired-end whole-genome sequencing. (Details are provided in the Methods 
section in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org.)
Acquired versus Transmitted Resistance
We used a clinical case definition to determine whether XDR tuberculosis developed in 
participants because of acquired resistance or transmission. Participants who met any of the 
following criteria were considered to have XDR tuberculosis that developed through 
acquired resistance: self-report of treatment for MDR tuberculosis 30 or more days before 
the diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis, a medical record documenting treatment for MDR 
tuberculosis before the diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis, a medical record documenting 10 or 
more days of treatment with second-line antituberculosis drugs for indications other than 
tuberculosis, or any previous results of drug-susceptibility testing showing resistance to 
isoniazid and rifampin but susceptibility to fluoroquinolones or second-line injectable drugs 
(i.e., MDR tuberculosis or pre-XDR tuberculosis). Participants who did not meet any of 
these criteria were classified as having XDR tuberculosis that developed because of 
transmitted resistance.
We also developed a genotypic case definition to differentiate acquired resistance from 
transmitted resistance. Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates with RFLP patterns within a 1-
band difference and identical targeted gene sequencing for inhA, katG, rpoB, pncA, and 
gyrA were considered to compose a genotypic cluster and to be due to transmission. 
Unmatched isolates were considered to be unique and to be due to acquired resistance. 
Pairwise single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data from whole-genome sequencing were 
used to validate the genotypic case definition (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In addition to estimating transmission rates according to each definition alone, we combined 
them to determine a minimum estimate of cases that arose owing to transmission with high 
certainty. These were cases of XDR tuberculosis in participants who had not received 
previous treatment for MDR tuberculosis and who had isolates that clustered according to 
genotype.
Characterization of Transmission Networks
We analyzed social-network data to determine epidemiologic links among participants. 
Person-to-person links included two enrolled participants who directly named each other or 
named the same contact. Link Plus software was used to match persons according to name, 
age, and sex.18

 We identified overlapping hospitalizations during which at least one participant was in a 
“vulnerable period,” defined as 1 or more months before the diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis 
(according to the sputum collection date). Participants with overlapping hospitalizations 
with another participant during their vulnerable period were considered to have a hospital-
based link. We also analyzed data regarding other congregate locations named by the 
patients. We compared genotypes among participants within epidemiologic networks.
Statistical Analysis
We analyzed demographic and clinical characteristics using descriptive statistics, t-tests, the 
chi-square test, and Fisher’s exact test. We used UCINET software for social-network 
analysis of person-to-person and hospital links.19 The geographic representativeness of 
participants with XDR tuberculosis who were enrolled in the study was assessed by 
comparing their diagnosing health facility with the diagnosing health facility of patients who 
were not enrolled. All the authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and 
analysis presented.
Results
Participants
From May 2011 through August 2014, a total of 1027 patients had a diagnosis of XDR 
tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal (incidence, 3.1 cases per 100,000 population). These 
diagnoses were made at 212 health care facilities that were located across all 11 districts of 
the province.
We screened a convenience sample of 521 patients with XDR tuberculosis (51%) and 
obtained written informed consent from 404 patients (39%) (Fig. 1A). Reasons for 
nonenrollment were the following: 72 patients declined to participate, 29 patients could not 
be reached, 8 patients died and did not have next of kin, and 8 patients had other reasons for 
nonenrollment. The geographic distribution of enrollees did not differ significantly from the 
overall distribution of patients with a diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis (P = 0.70). Among 
enrolled participants, 234 were female (58%), the median age was 34 years (interquartile 
range, 28 to 43), and 50% lived in rural areas (Table 1). A total of 311 participants (77%) 
had HIV infection, of whom 236 (76%) were receiving antiretroviral therapy. The median 
CD4+ count was 340 cells per cubic millimeter (interquartile range, 117 to 431), and 155 
participants (50%) had an undetectable viral load. A sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli was 
positive in 270 participants (67%), and 70 participants (17%) had cavitary disease. Forty-
four participants (11%) died before study enrollment, and a family member provided 
consent for study enrollment.
Acquired versus Transmitted Resistance
A total of 124 participants (31%) had been previously treated for MDR tuberculosis, and 
XDR tuberculosis was presumed to have developed through acquired resistance, according 
to the clinical case definition (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Treatment outcomes 
of the previous MDR tuberculosis episode were cure or completed treatment in 6% of the 
participants, treatment failure in 84%, and loss to follow-up or transfer in 10% (Table 1).

 None of the participants received a fluoroquinolone or injectable antibiotics for 10 days or 
more for indications other than tuberculosis. XDR tuberculosis developed in the remaining 
280 participants (69%) through transmission of an XDR tuberculosis strain.
IS6110 RFLP and targeted gene sequencing were completed in M. tuberculosis isolates 
obtained from 386 participants (96%). Of these isolates, 323 (84%) had a genotype that 
matched that of an isolate from another study participant (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The matching isolates formed 31 clusters that ranged in size from 2 to 14 
participants, with the exception of one large cluster of 212 participants (55%) with the 
LAM4/KZN strain (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). Within clusters, the median 
pairwise SNP difference was 5 SNPs to the closest participant (interquartile range, 3 to 8) 
and 16 SNPs among all cluster members; whole-genome sequencing could not further divide 
the LAM4/KZN cluster into subclusters (Fig. 2).
According to the combined clinical and genotypic case definitions, 61% of the participants 
had not received previous treatment for MDR tuberculosis and their isolates were part of a 
genotypic cluster; this percentage is a minimum estimate of the proportion of participants 
with XDR tuberculosis that developed through transmission (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). An additional 8% of the participants had not received previous treatment for 
MDR tuberculosis, but their isolates did not have a genotype that matched that of another 
study participant, and 23% of the participants had received treatment for MDR tuberculosis, 
but their isolates were clustered with at least one other study participant. XDR tuberculosis 
may have developed because of transmission in both these groups of participants as well.
Social-Network Analysis
We identified person-to-person or hospital-based epidemiologic links in 123 participants 
(30%). A total of 2901 contacts were named (median contacts per participant, 7; 
interquartile range, 4 to 10). The majority of contacts were household members (2301 of 
2901 contacts, 79%); 376 contacts were from workplaces (13%), and 224 contacts were 
from other community settings (8%) such as a church. Among named contacts, 293 were 
reported to have had tuberculosis (10%) and 25 were reported to have had XDR tuberculosis 
(1%). Thirteen of these 25 participants were enrolled in this study.
A person-to-person link was identified in 59 of 404 participants (15%) who formed 25 social 
networks (Fig. 3). A total of 111 connections linked these 59 participants; 93 links (84%) 
were to household members, 8 (7%) were to persons in workplaces, and 10 (9%) were to 
persons in other community settings. Certain networks spanned multiple homes, family 
generations, and community settings (Fig. S3A and S3B in the Supplementary Appendix).
A total of 298 of the study participants (74%) reported having been hospitalized in the 5 
years before study enrollment; of these participants, 86 (29%) were hospitalized at more 
than one hospital. Participants were admitted to 53 different hospitals (Fig. 1B). The median 
duration of hospitalization was 2 months (interquartile range, 1 to 4).
Among the 298 participants who were hospitalized, 117 (39%) were admitted before they 
received a diagnosis of XDR tuberculosis. Seventy-one of these 117 participants (61%) had

 a hospital-based link with another study participant (Fig. S3C in the Supplementary 
Appendix). The median number of participants with whom hospitalizations overlapped was 
3 (interquartile range, 1 to 18) for a median of 1 month (interquartile range, 1 to 2).
A total of 177 other locations were reported by 124 participants (31%) as sites where they 
spent substantial time. These sites were 73 churches, 43 bars, 10 beauty salons, 9 prisons, 7 
restaurants, 6 nightclubs, and 29 other locations. No locations were named by 2 or more 
participants to suggest a direct link.
Combined Analysis of Epidemiologic and Genotyping Data
Among the 123 participants with an epidemiologic link (30%), 112 had an isolate available 
for genotyping. Of these participants, 79 isolates (71%) had a matching RFLP pattern and 39 
(35%) were in a genotypic cluster (RFLP plus targeted sequencing) with one of their links. 
In 21 person-to-person networks, genotyping was available for at least 2 participants. A 
matching RFLP pattern was seen in 15 of these networks (71%), of which 10 (48%) were in 
a genotypic cluster. Of the 71 participants with hospital-based links, 46 (65%) had isolates 
with a matching RFLP and 19 (27%) had isolates that were in a genotypic cluster.
Discussion
In the interval since XDR tuberculosis was first described globally and in South Africa,6,20 
the XDR tuberculosis epidemic in South Africa has continued unabated. The incidence of 
XDR tuberculosis in South Africa (2.8 cases per 100,000 population) is on par with the 
incidence of all forms of tuberculosis in the United States,21 despite substantial efforts to 
expand access to treatment for MDR tuberculosis, improve cure rates of tuberculosis, and 
scale up rapid diagnostic testing.
In this study, we examined the role of transmission in the ongoing epidemic of XDR 
tuberculosis by combining multiple genotyping methods with social-network and 
epidemiologic analysis. We found that XDR tuberculosis remains widespread throughout 
KwaZulu-Natal and that transmission is the primary driver of the epidemic. Inadequate 
treatment of MDR tuberculosis accounted for, at most, 31% of cases of XDR tuberculosis. 
Genotyping methods also showed the clonal nature of this epidemic and provide further 
support for the predominant role of transmission. Social-network analysis showed 
connections among participants with XDR tuberculosis; these connections created numerous 
opportunities for transmission not only in hospitals, but also in community settings. Our 
finding of the role of transmission in the epidemic of XDR tuberculosis provides insight as 
to why the epidemic continues, at least in this community, as efforts to control tuberculosis 
to date have not sufficiently addressed the interruption of transmission.22,23
In our study, we enrolled a cohort of participants with XDR tuberculosis and assessed their 
M. tuberculosis isolates and medical records. At least 69% of the cases of XDR tuberculosis 
were attributable to transmission, and 84% clustered according to genotype with another 
participant. Participants were enrolled from a wide geographic area, and half were from rural 
areas. The results of whole-genome sequencing provide support for these findings, with a 
median difference of 5 SNPs between the most closely connected patients in each cluster;

 these findings are similar to published thresholds for transmission of M. tuberculosis.24–27 
Our study results expand on previous studies from South Africa and countries with a low 
prevalence of HIV infection, such as China, Russia, and countries in the former Soviet 
Union.17,28–33 Moreover, our study design, which captured isolates from a large number of 
cases of XDR tuberculosis over a 4-year period, overcame limitations of previous studies 
that were not able to show the role of transmission.34
Despite the broad geographic area and incomplete enrollment of all the patients in whom 
XDR tuberculosis was diagnosed, we identified epidemiologic links among 30% of 
participants. Networks included multiple households and hospitals, in addition to person-to-
person links among schoolmates and church members. Although transmission of drug-
resistant tuberculosis in hospitals is well described,7 a more complex web of 
interconnectedness in both health care and community settings is probably needed to support 
an epidemic of this scale. Further characterization of these networks is needed to design 
interventions in order to interrupt transmission.
Efforts to halt transmission have focused on health care settings, which typically have 
congregate wards and crowded clinics. Since the majority of study participants reported 
having been hospitalized, established interventions such as redesigning health care facilities, 
implementing infection-control programs, and providing outpatient treatment remain 
important considerations in designing a comprehensive strategy.35–39 Methods for 
controlling transmission in community settings are less well studied. Since nearly half the 
epidemiologic links in our study occurred in households, interventions that decrease 
transmission in community settings are needed. Early identification of patients with drug-
resistant tuberculosis, screening of household contacts, and universal drug-susceptibility 
testing for all patients who are suspected of having tuberculosis are recommended.40,41
Another finding from our study was the large pool of 2901 contacts who were exposed to 
XDR tuberculosis. The number of contacts per index case is consistent with the numbers in 
other contact-tracing studies in which nearly half the contacts became infected with 
tuberculosis.29,41,42 If some of the contacts in this study became infected with XDR 
tuberculosis, a reservoir of latent XDR tuberculosis infection would be created, and this 
reservoir would further complicate control efforts. Without preventive therapy for latent 
XDR tuberculosis infection, these persons are at risk for reactivating and continuing to 
expand the epidemic of XDR tuberculosis.
Several limitations may have affected our estimates of transmission. Because of the large 
case numbers, we were not able to enroll all the patients with a diagnosis of XDR 
tuberculosis during the study period. In addition, because of limited use of culture and drug-
susceptibility testing, many patients with XDR tuberculosis may not have been identified. 
The proportion of cases arising from transmission is therefore a minimal estimate because 
participants may have been misclassified as having unique genotypes if their source case did 
not receive a diagnosis or was not enrolled. The number of transmission links is also 
probably an underestimate, since unenrolled patients may have had linkages with our study 
participants. Nevertheless, our finding that 30% of the participants formed an epidemiologic 
cluster is striking.

 Furthermore, since no reference standard exists for identifying transmission, we used a 
conservative case definition such that anyone who had received previous treatment for MDR 
tuberculosis was classified as having XDR tuberculosis that developed through acquired 
resistance. This definition may have resulted in misclassification, however, because persons 
who had MDR tuberculosis previously can be superinfected with XDR tuberculosis strains, 
and therefore XDR tuberculosis would have developed through transmission.43
Finally, we used a medical-record review to determine previous treatment for MDR 
tuberculosis. This approach may have resulted in an incomplete capture of antibiotic 
exposure for indications other than tuberculosis at hospitals or clinics that were not covered 
in our review. Despite the potential pitfalls of medical-record review, the results of 
genotyping and whole-genome sequencing in this study provide further evidence supporting 
the study findings.
The epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis is increasingly recognized as a threat to global 
health, given the limited treatment options and high mortality. The lack of effective 
preventive therapy for contacts of persons with XDR tuberculosis further underscores the 
need to control the current epidemic. We have shown that transmission was the major driver 
of the epidemic of XDR tuberculosis in KwaZulu-Natal during the study period. As the 
global tuberculosis community mobilizes around the goal of no new tuberculosis infections, 
the age-old approach of turning off the tap by stopping transmission is all the more critical 
for halting epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis.44

 Figure 2. Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)–Based Maximum Likelihood Phylogenetic Tree
Isolates are labeled according to study identification number and color coded according to 
restriction-fragment– length polymorphism (RFLP) group. Single-isolate RFLP groups are 
shown in black. The tree is rooted to the lineage 7 isolate Percy256. L2 denotes lineage 2, 
and L4 lineage 4. The other abbreviations (MH, W, AH, BW, BH, GY, CC, and HP) denote 
common RFLP patterns seen between isolates. The letters were assigned according to the 
first time that a particular RFLP pattern was seen (often many years before the current 
study). The blue circular band shows that all the isolates on the branches on the tree below it

 are from lineage 4. The orange band shows that the isolates under it belong to lineage 2. At 
the center of the circular tree, one large branch separates all the isolates below the orange 
band from those below the blue band. All internal nodes separating RFLP groups are 
supported by 100 of 100 bootstrap replicates. Publicly available sequences (not sequenced 
for this study) are marked with asterisks. The scale bar indicates the maximum-likelihood 
estimate of the number of substitutions per site.

 Figure 3. Social Networks in Homes and Communities, Derived from Name-Based Person-to-
Person Links
A social network of 59 participants with direct person-to-person links is shown. Large black 
circles indicate study participants. Small circles indicate 450 close contacts named by 
participants. Lines between two large circles indicate 2 study participants who named each 
other as a close contact. Lines between a large circle and a small circle show contacts named 
by each participant. Contacts’ circles are shaded according to their history of tuberculosis, as 
reported by the study participant (white denotes no previous active tuberculosis, gray 
previous active tuberculosis, and black previous XDR tuberculosis). Additional details are 
provided in Figure S3A in the Supplementary Appendix.
