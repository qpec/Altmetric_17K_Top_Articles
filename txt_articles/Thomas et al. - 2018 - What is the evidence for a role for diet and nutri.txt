osteoarthritis?

Abstract
As current treatment options in OA are very limited, OA patients would benefit greatly from some ability to
self-manage their condition. Since diet may potentially affect OA, we reviewed the literature on the relation-
ship between nutrition and OA risk or progression, aiming to provide guidance for clinicians. For overweight/
obese patients, weight reduction, ideally incorporating exercise, is paramount. The association between
metabolic syndrome, type-2 diabetes and OA risk or progression may partly explain the apparent benefit
of dietary-lipid modification resulting from increased consumption of long-chain omega-3 fatty-acids from oily
fish/fish oil supplements. A strong association between OA and raised serum cholesterol together with clinical
effects in statin users suggests a potential benefit of reduction of cholesterol by dietary means. Patients
should ensure that they meet the recommended intakes for micronutrients such as vitamin K, which has
a role in bone/cartilage mineralization. Evidence for a role of vitamin D supplementation in OA is
unconvincing.

Rheumatology key messages
. Overweight and obese OA patients should implement a weight-loss strategy incorporating exercise tailored to
mobility.
. Increasing consumption of long-chain n-3 fatty-acids (oily fish/fish oil supplements) may improve pain and func-
tion in OA patients.
. Reducing raised blood cholesterol and increasing intake of rich vitamin K sources may benefit OA.
Introduction
OA is the most prevalent form of arthritis [1] and the fast-
est growing cause of disability worldwide [2]. Globally,
some 18% of women and 9.6% of men aged over 60
years have symptomatic OA, with a quarter of these
individuals unable to perform routine daily activities [3].
By 2050, a projected 130 million people will suffer with
OA, constituting a significant societal burden [4].
OA pathology is multifactorial, involving the remodelling
of subchondral bone, synovial inflammation and loss of
articular cartilage [5]. Inflammatory cytokines, notably
IL-1b and TNF-a, drive catabolic pathways and perpetuate
disease progression [6]. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor
for OA [7] at least partly due to its associated inflammation
[8]. It has recently been suggested that obesity, diabetes
and the metabolic syndrome (MetS) can directly influence
the development of OA [9]. A metabolic OA phenotype has
been identified, which is driven by adipokines, hypergly-
caemia and endocrine imbalance [1].
Current OA treatment is limited and is largely confined
to symptom management [1] or total joint replacement if
joint function is severely compromised [10]. Osteoarthritis
Research Society International guidelines [11] recommend
exercise and weight reduction in the overweight/obese,
but there may be low provision of these treatments in clin-
ical practice [2].

 There is a call for a shift towards helping OA patients to
self-manage their condition [11]. Since diet is a factor that
may affect OA, we performed an up-to-date, literature
review of the evidence for an effect of dietary factors in
OA with the aim of summarizing current research findings.
Guidance is targeted at clinicians, notably rheumatolo-
gists, general practitioners and dietitians and our findings
form the basis of a patient information sheet (supplemen-
tary Fig. S1, available at Rheumatology online, and at
https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/OsteoArthritis.pdf).
Methods
For this narrative review, the PubMed database was
searched for articles on the effect of OA, obesity, polyun-
saturated fatty acids, cholesterol and vitamins A, C, D, E
and K on risk or progression of OA. The focus was on
foods or nutrients that are part of the normal diet, not on
nutraceuticals, which are generally consumed in pharma-
cological, rather than dietary, doses. Using key search
terms (Table 1), searches were conducted between
October 2015 and May 2017, for papers from the past
10 years, but were extended back to 2000 for vitamins
A, C, D and E and to 1995 for vitamin K owing to the
paucity of information available. Human studies, including
observational and cohort studies, and randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) were included. Excluding duplicates,
1190 articles were retrieved.
Articles were examined and filtered by relevance.
Papers were excluded if outcome measures could not
be related to disease progression or symptoms, or quality
was demonstrably poor. Sixty-eight articles were included
in the final review. Where appropriate, reference lists
were consulted for highly regarded older papers and pri-
mary evidence. Relevant conclusions or results were ex-
tracted from each article. Bradford�Hill criteria [12] and
the
critical
appraisal
skills
programme
(CASP)
tool
[13, 14] were used to appraise the evidence for each
topic. With the heterogeneity of data rendering a system-
atic approach challenging, evidence is presented as a
narrative review.
Results and discussion
Obesity
Consequences of obesity in OA
Obesity increases strain on weight-bearing joints [15] and,
longitudinally, overweight and obese individuals are at con-
siderably higher risk for knee arthroplasty [16]. An association
of higher BMI with the development of hand OA [17] dem-
onstrates an additional non-biomechanical role of obesity in
OA. In the large Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity cohort
study, fat percentage was associated with hand OA: OR
(95% CI): 1.34 (1.11, 1.61) in men and 1.26 (1.05, 1.51) in
women [18]. Fat mass and waist-to-hip ratio were associated
with hand OA, with an association with visceral fat in men
[18]. Adiposity relates to risk of arthroplasty in knee and hip
OA, with a relationship to central adiposity in knee OA [19].
Obesity leads to low-grade systemic inflammation and
weight reduction can reduce adipose tissue and restore
normal secretion patterns [20]. Adipokines could comprise
a critical link between obesity and OA [21]. Leptin, an
adipokine generally elevated in obesity and produced by
white adipose tissue of the infra-patellar fat pad, may
underlie this relationship [22]. Leptin is associated with
inflammation and cartilage degradation [23] and may be
involved in OA pathophysiology at a local and systemic
level [24]. Figure 1 summarizes the mechanisms linking
obesity to OA pathogenesis [25].
Relationship with MetS. Central obesity, glucose intoler-
ance (insulin resistance), dyslipidaemia and hypertension
embody the MetS [26]. OA has been suggested to be a
fifth component with shared mechanisms of inflammation
and oxidative stress [27]. The Research on Osteoarthritis/
Osteoporosis Against Disability cohort (n = 1384) demon-
strated increased radiographic incidence and progression
of knee OA with the accumulation of MetS components:
53 components, for incidence, OR (95% CI): 9.83 (3.57,
27.1), P < 0.001; for progression: 2.80 (1.68, 4.68),
P < 0.001 [9]. A similar effect of MetS components on
knee-OA risk was seen in the Melbourne Collaborative
Cohort Study though no statistically significant associations
were
observed

 pathogenesis of knee and hip OA differ [28]. Prevalence of
hand OA was associated with the MetS in the Netherlands
Epidemiology of Obesity cohort study in 6673 participants;
adjusted OR (95% CI): 1.46 (1.06, 2.02) [29].
Relationship with type-2 diabetes
Hyperglycaemia prompts local accumulation of advanced-
glycation end products, impairing subchondral bone and
chondrocyte function [27]. In a German cohort study,
type-2 diabetes was identified as an independent risk
factor for severe OA and a predictor for knee/hip replace-
ment [30]. In a French study of patients with knee OA as-
sessed over 3 years, type-2 diabetes was a significant
predictor of joint-space-width reduction in men [31].
Clinical effects of weight reduction on OA
As outlined in Table 2 [32�35], a systematic review and
meta-analysis of RCTs revealed significant improvement
in physical disability in knee OA when body-weight reduc-
tion was over 5% [35]. Subsequent clinical trials demon-
strated that weight reduction reduced pain and improved
function in knee OA [33, 34]. In obese participants under-
taking a weight-control intervention, weight reduction
reduced peak knee load and pain [32], and provided
symptomatic relief, irrespective of structural damage [36].
Datasets from the Osteoarthritis Initiative and the
Multicentre Osteoarthritis Study demonstrate a highly sig-
nificant (P < 0.003) dose�response relationship between
weight change and improvement in WOMAC pain and
function [37]. A reduction in body weight of 10% is asso-
ciated longitudinally with increased functional capacity
and reduced pain in knee OA patients [37] and is addition-
ally beneficial for metabolic health [28].
Physical activity as an adjunct to weight reduction
Reducing adipose tissue while maintaining muscle mass
is advantageous in OA, particularly for mobility [38, 39].
Physical activity generates changes in white adipose
tissue, including increased mitochondrial biogenesis and
an altered adipokine profile [40], and hence weight reduc-
tion programmes that combine diet and exercise have the
most benefit on functional status, joint imaging and visual
analogue scale pain [41]. Meta-analysis indicates that
interventions
combining
strengthening,
flexibility
and
aerobic exercise are most likely to improve pain and
function [42]. However, caloric restriction is still integral,
as highlighted in a trial in which knee compressive forces
were lowest in a diet group and inflammation (IL-6) was
lowest in a diet-and-exercise group, compared with
exercise alone [34] (Table 2).
Effective weight management
Weight reduction and maintenance of an optimal weight is
challenging, particularly when mobility is impaired [25].
Activity should be tailored to the mobility, co-morbidities
and preferences of the individual [43]. Successful weight
reduction interventions may incorporate dietitian input
[32, 36]. In clinical practice, behaviour-change strategies,
increased contact and follow-up will improve adherence
to weight-management programmes [44].
Conclusions on obesity and weight reduction in OA
Weight reduction in overweight or obese OA patients re-
duces joint impact and injurious loading, improves inflam-
matory adipokine secretion patterns and positively affects
metabolic-risk profile. Effective dietary interventions do
not deviate greatly from general weight-management
guidelines [45]. Guidance is given in Table 3 [46�56].
Polyunsaturated fatty acids
Dietary-lipid modification in OA
Lipids are stored in the matrix and chondrocytes of articu-
lar cartilage and may contribute towards inflammation,
cartilage degradation and impaired chondrocyte structure
[57]. OA joints accumulate high levels of omega-6 (n-6)

 fatty acids, precursors of pro-inflammatory eicosanoids
[58]. In individuals with, or at high risk of, knee OA, a posi-
tive association was seen between the n-6 polyunsatur-
ated fatty acid (PUFA) arachidonic acid (AA) and synovitis
but an inverse relationship between total plasma n-3
PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and patellofemoral
cartilage loss, as measured by MRI [59]. With diet influen-
cing systemic lipid levels [59], it is plausible that dietary
manipulation could affect articular-cartilage composition
and structural damage in knee OA. A large prospective
study in OA patients found that higher intakes of total
and saturated fat were associated with increased knee
joint space-width loss, whereas higher intakes of monoun-
saturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and PUFAs were asso-
ciated with reduced radiographic progression [60].
Rationale for an effect of PUFAs in inflammation in OA
Eicosanoids are hormone-like agents that mediate and
regulate inflammation. Figure 2 illustrates their formation
from 20-carbon precursors [61, 62]. Eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) and DHA create less potent inflammatory eico-
sanoids than those formed from the n-6 series. Indirectly,
long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFAs decrease production of pro-
inflammatory eicosanoids, reactive oxygen and nitrogen
species and cytokines, additionally generating anti-inflam-
matory mediators (resolvins) [62].
In vitro models have suggested benefits of LC n-3 PUFA
supplementation for inflamed joints, with EPA proving
the most effective [63, 64]. In canine OA, fish oil n-3
fatty acids improved weight bearing [65] and the arthritic
condition [66].
PUFAs in the diet
The Western diet has a high ratio of n-6 to n-3 fatty acids
[67],
predisposing
to
inflammation
[59].
Within
the
Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study of healthy individ-
uals, increased n-6 fatty acid consumption was associated
with the development of bone-marrow lesions [68]. AA ori-
ginates from meat and from the conversion of linoleic acid
(LA), commonly found in vegetable oils (Fig. 2). Oils high in
n-6 fatty acids include safflower oil (79%) and sunflower oil
(62.2%), with low levels in olive oil, which is rich in mono-
unsaturates [69]. The richest source of a-linolenic acid is
flaxseed oil (57%) [59], but its conversion into EPA/DHA is

Intervention
Detail of recommended interventions
Points to note
Weight reduction
in overweight or
obese patients
An initial aim of 10% body weight reduction should be included
in a first-line approach for obese patients with OA. Overall aim
for obese/overweight patients is for BMI within the healthy
range (18.5�25 kg/m2)
Dietary modification should include moderate energy restriction
without compromising micronutrient intake
Exercise should be encouraged including aspects of aerobic ex-
ercise, strengthening and flexibility that should be tailored to
mobility
Regular clinical contact and
monitoring, including dietetic
input, are essential for dietary
modification. Clinical input
should incorporate a focus on
behaviour change
Beneficial dietary-
lipid modifica-
tion in OA
patients
Reduce intake of n-6 fatty acids by substituting oils rich in mono-
unsaturates such as rapeseed, canola and olive oils.
Aim to increase intake of long-chain n-3 fatty acids via a direct
source of EPA/DHA; increase intake of oily fish; aim to consume
a minimum one portion per week (as in general healthy eating
guidelines) and preferably two
Consider a daily standard fish oil supplement (1�2 capsules/day)
Women who are pregnant or
breastfeeding should avoid
fish with high levels of mer-
cury (i.e. shark, swordfish and
king mackerel) [46] and
should avoid cod-liver oil due
to the vitamin A content [47]
Dietary manage-
ment of choles-
terol, serum
lipids and
comorbidities,
CVD and MetS
A cholesterol-lowering dietary portfolio should be advocated to
patients with raised serum cholesterol (>5 mmol/l/>200 mg/dl)
or LDL-C (>3 mmol/l/>100 mg/dl)a to reduce CHD risk with the
potential for OA benefit
52 g/day plant stanols/sterols [49]
Reduce SFA intake to < 11% total energy (around 31 g/day for
males and 24 g/day for females)
Ensure daily intake of viscous fibre (e.g. oats), soy protein (25 g)
and nuts (30 g)
For obese/overweight patients, weight reductionb remains of pri-
mary importance both for OA symptom management and re-
duction in risk of the co-morbidities, CVD and MetS
Sources of soy protein include
soy milk (7.5 g soy protein per
250 ml serving), soy/edamame
beans and tofu
To achieve ad-
equate levels of
vitamins A, C
and E
Ensure adequate daily intake through consumption of rich dietary
sources (see supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology
online)
Adult recommended intakes are shown below:
Vitamin A (retinol equivalent): 650�750 mg/day (Europe [50]);
700�900 mg/day (USA [51])c
Vitamin C: 95�110 mg/day (Europe [52]); 75�90 mg (USA [51])c
Vitamin E (a-tocopherol equivalent): an adequate intake level of
11�13 mg/day (Europe [53]); 15 mg/day (USA [51, 107])
Only consider a multivitamin supplement if dietary intake of these
nutrients
is
insufficient
to
meet
dietary
recommendations.
Obtaining intake through diet is preferable
US guidelines suggest an
additional 30 mg/day Vitamin
C for smokers
To increase vita-
min D intake/
status
Increase consumption of vitamin-D-rich foods, for example, oily
fish, eggs (yolks), vitamin-D-fortified spreads, fortified milk, for-
tified
cereals
(see
supplementary
Table
S2,
available
at
Rheumatology online)
During the summer months, daily sunlight exposure (without pro-
tective cream/lotion) of approximately 10�20 min (depending on
skin type, time of day, altitude and latitude) should be sufficient
to produce adequate vitamin D [54, 55]
With minimal sun exposure, supplementation of 15�20 mg/day
should be encouraged, based on European and American
guidelines, to ensure sufficient vitamin D concentration [54, 55]
Maintaining a healthy BMI, that is, between 18.5 and 25 kg/m2,
will reduce the risk of vitamin D sequestration in adipose tissue
[54, 55, 126, 127]
To increase vita-
min K intake
Increase green-vegetable consumption, particularly of rich sources
such as spinach, Brussels sprouts, kale and broccoli [56] (see
supplementary Table S2, available at Rheumatology online for
list of sources)
Certain fats and oils (e.g. blended vegetable oil, olive oil and mar-
garine [56]) contain small amounts of vitamin K and therefore
utilizing these in cooking or as plant spreads may increase
intake
The addition of a fat (such as
olive oil) to a vitamin K source
may increase bioavailability,
as vitamin K is fat-soluble

 inefficient [70]. Increasing LC n-3 PUFA status to promote
an anti-inflammatory effect is best achieved with direct EPA
intake alongside decreased LA intake.
EPA and DHA are found primarily in oily fish [71] (see
supplementary
Table
S1,
available
at
Rheumatology
online). UK intakes of oily fish are below the recommended
level of ‘at least one portion/week’ [72, 73] and a significant
number of US adults are not meeting American Dietary
Guidelines of an average consumption of 250 mg LC n-3
fatty acids per day [74]. Higher intakes of EPA/DHA, includ-
ing the proposed anti-inflammatory threshold of >2.7 g/day
[75], may be more easily achieved by fish oil supplementa-
tion. In a large Australian study, 32.6% of the population
had recently taken fish oil or n-3 supplements, with OA
patients more likely to use them [76].
EPA/DHA supplementation
The use of fish oils has shown clinical efficacy for pain
reduction in RA [61, 77], but published trials of LC n-3
fatty acid supplementation in OA are limited. A systematic
review and meta-analysis concluded that there was no
statistically significant effect of marine oil supplements
for OA pain (five trials; �0.17; 95% CI: �0.57, 0.24) [78].
However the quality of the trials included was graded as
‘very low’, and the results for the OA group were highly
heterogeneous leading the authors to state that the evi-
dence was not sufficiently robust to determine the effect
of marine oil in patients with diagnoses other than RA [78].
Hill and colleagues [79] conducted a double-blind 2-year
RCT in 202 knee-OA patients. There was no placebo
group, attributed to efforts to maintain blinding and for

 ethical reasons [79]. Unexpectedly, greater benefits to
WOMAC pain and function scores were found from a
low-dose (0.45 g LC n-3) fish oil supplement than from a
high, anti-inflammatory dose (4.5 g LC n-3) [79]. The au-
thors concluded that there was no additional benefit of
high-dose
over low-dose fish
oil in knee OA [79].
The low-dose supplement comparator was composed
largely of Sunola oil, a monounsaturated n-9 fatty acid.
Unlike olive oil, it is not rich in polyphenols with known
antioxidant and potentially anti-inflammatory effects [80].
However, there may have been benefit to pain from the
high oleic acid content [81], which may have effectively
constituted a second active intervention [82].
Conclusions on importance of PUFAs in OA
Adding complexity to supplementation trials, the effects of
fish oil can be affected by polymorphisms that alter the
expression of cytokine genes [62] and it is difficult to find
an appropriate placebo oil. Though further studies with
appropriate controls are needed, there may be efficacy
for pain reduction with a low-dose supplement equivalent
to 1.5 standard capsules of 1 g fish oil/day [79]. Moreover,
there is evidence for fish oil being of benefit to cardiovas-
cular health [83], which may be relevant to this population
owing
to
the
association
of
OA
with
MetS
[27].
Recommendations are summarized in Table 3.
Cholesterol
Links between elevated blood cholesterol and OA
Epidemiological studies have implicated serum choles-
terol as a systemic OA risk factor [84�86]. In women
from the Chingford study, knee OA was significantly asso-
ciated with moderately raised serum cholesterol (OR =
2.06; 95% CI: 1.06, 3.98) [84]. In a cross-sectional study
of patients with OA-related arthroplasty, hypercholester-
olaemia, defined as 56.2 mmol/l (239 mg/dl), was inde-
pendently associated with generalized OA [85]. Hand OA
has recently been associated with documented hyper-
cholesterolaemia [86]. Longitudinal data have strength-
ened the evidence; in an Australian cohort of healthy
women, for every 1 mmol/l increase in total cholesterol,
the adjusted odds of developing a bone-marrow lesion
were 1.84 (95% CI: 1.01, 3.36), P = 0.048 [87].
Cholesterol accumulation in OA
Cellular cholesterol accumulation is known to induce cyto-
toxicity [88] and hypercholesterolaemia can increase AA
formation and production of pro-inflammatory eicosa-
noids [89]. Cholesterol has been found to accumulate in
human OA cartilage [90]. Accumulation is typically pre-
vented through the cholesterol efflux system [88], which
may be dysregulated in OA [91]. An association has been
found between OA pathogenesis and a single nucleotide
polymorphism in SRBP-2, the gene for a protein involved
in cholesterol homeostasis [92]. Furthermore, low-density
lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol appears to influence OA de-
velopment and progression [93]. In mice induced with OA
and fed a cholesterol-rich diet, LDL accumulation led to
increased synovial activation and osteophyte formation
[94]. Oxidized LDL, in particular, may be involved in syn-
ovial inflammation and cartilage destruction [93].
Does reducing serum lipids reduce the burden of OA?
Reducing cholesterol accumulation with statins appears
to have favourable effects in OA. A 10-year longitudinal
study in a large cohort (n = 16 609) found that an increas-
ing therapeutic statin dose vs no statin dose was incre-
mentally associated with a decreased incidence of clinical
OA [95]. In a further cohort, statin use was associated with
over 50% reduction in radiographic progression of knee
OA [OR (95% CI): 0.43 (0.25, 0.77)] [96]. Statins also
reduce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and at-
tenuate inflammation in OA [97]; they have been shown to
exert chondroprotective effects by reducing cartilage
degradation, with atorvastatin treatment inhibiting IL-1b
and expression of MMP-13 in vitro [98].
Cholesterol-lowering dietary strategies applicable to OA
Cholesterol can also be lowered by dietary strategies [99].
Assuming additive effects, dietary changes could result in
a 35% reduction in LDL-cholesterol, equivalent to that of a
starting dose of statins [99, 100] (Fig. 3). Energy restricted
weight reduction is of primary importance for reducing
LDL-cholesterol in the overweight and obese [99, 101].
Saturated fat should be reduced to 11% of total energy
with PUFAs and MUFAs acting as favourable substitutes
[100]. Dietary cholesterol (as in eggs) is now known to
exert a relatively insignificant effect on serum cholesterol
compared with that of saturated fatty acids [100]. Viscous
(soluble) fibre appears to lower serum cholesterol by
5�10% for a 5�10 g daily dose [102] and oat (b)-glucans
have been found to be effective in a 3 g dose [103]. Meta-
analysis concluded that 25 g soy protein/day contributed
to total and LDL-cholesterol reduction [104]. There is
strong evidence that plant stanols and sterols lower
LDL-cholesterol [49]. Their richest source is fortified pro-
prietary spreads, drinks and yogurts. A meta-analysis of
41 trials showed that intake of 2 g/day of stanols/sterols
reduced LDL-cholesterol by 10% [49]. There appears to

 be a dose�effect relationship such that a dose of 9�10 g of
plant stanols lowered LDL-cholesterol by 18% [105]. Nuts
provide a source of unsaturated fats, soluble fibre and
phytosterols [106]. A meta-analysis of 61 intervention
trials found that tree nuts (e.g. almonds, walnuts and pis-
tachios) significantly lowered total and LDL-cholesterol
[107]. Including 30 g/day [108] of nuts in the diet could
provide a simple cholesterol-lowering strategy. Dietary
interventions to lower cholesterol and serum lipids and
manage comorbidities are given in Table 3.
Antioxidants and OA
A plausible rationale exists for a role of antioxidants in OA;
reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species
may be involved in the pathophysiology of OA, and there-
fore suppressing these with antioxidants might delay its
onset and progression [109, 110]. The antioxidant vita-
mins, A, C and E have received the most attention in
this context with vitamin C being particularly relevant
owing to its requirement for collagen formation [111].
Human studies on antioxidants and OA
Trials so far have primarily focused on the effects of vita-
min E in OA [112, 113]. A systematic review of trials has
investigated all three nutrients, although seven of the nine
studies included were vitamin E trials [113]. Findings were
conflicting, with only two short-term trials suggesting a
beneficial effect of vitamin E [113]. Though vitamin C sup-
plementation appeared to reduce OA pain, that effect has
not been reproduced in other trials. A later trial of vitamin
E supplementation (200 mg/day) in knee OA found a sig-
nificant benefit on pain and significantly increased levels
of circulating antioxidant enzymes [112]. No study to date
has solely investigated vitamin A supplementation in OA,
though when combined (as b-carotene) with vitamins C, E
and selenium, no effect was seen [113]. Unfortunately,
most of these studies were of poor quality with variations
in duration, sample size, measurement outcomes, supple-
ment dosage and form [112, 113].
Conclusions on antioxidant vitamins
At present, there are insufficient data to show benefit from
antioxidant supplementation in OA. However, for general
health, patients should be encouraged to eat a healthy
diet that includes adequate amounts of dietary antioxi-
dants (see recommendations in Table 3 [50�53]).
Vitamin D and OA
Although vitamin D has many biological roles, its primary
function is thought to be the regulation of bone metabol-
ism and calcium homeostasis [114]. The majority of its
activity occurs via the vitamin D receptors (VDRs), a sub-
family of nuclear receptors that regulate gene expression,
to which it binds with high affinity [114].
Postulated role of vitamin D in OA
Acting through the VDR, vitamin D has a major role in the
regulation of mineral homeostasis and bone metabolism
[114]. Thus, inadequate vitamin D status is thought
to
impair
the
ability
of
bone
to
respond
to
the
pathophysiological process of OA and influence disease
progression [114, 115]. Vitamin D is also believed to have
effects on inflammation and cytokine synthesis [115].
Furthermore, a number of trials have shown that vitamin
D
supplementation
has
positive
effects
on
muscle
strength [116, 117]; this may be beneficial in OA, which
is often associated with marked weakness of the quadri-
ceps muscles [118].
Human evidence on vitamin D in OA
Results from observational studies, predominantly in knee
OA, though inconsistent, suggest a positive association
between vitamin D deficiency, cartilage loss and OA
prevalence/progression [119, 120].
Trials have had mixed findings. Three RCTs found no
significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on cartil-
age volume or pain in knee OA [121�123], though in a post
hoc analysis of one study, significant improvements in
total WOMAC score and WOMAC function were found
[122]. Only one RCT has had positive results, viz., a sig-
nificant decrease in OA pain, and an increase in symp-
tomatic knee function [124]. A small non-controlled
intervention also found a significant increase in muscle
strength following two months of vitamin D supplementa-
tion [125]. In a recent trial, people with knee OA who
consistently
maintained
sufficient
plasma
vitamin
D
(>50 nmol/l) had significantly improved structural and
functional outcomes than those consistently insufficient,
suggesting a level of vitamin D status to aim for [126].
Alternative explanation for role of vitamin D in OA
There are alternative theories as to why vitamin D supple-
mentation has not translated into positive outcomes [127,
128]. Emerging evidence suggests that low vitamin D may
simply be a marker of ill-health across a number of con-
ditions [127], for example, the inflammatory process and
clinical course of OA could result in vitamin D deficiency
as a consequence, rather than a cause, of disease [127].
Indeed, low serum vitamin D in inflammatory conditions
may be due to the dysregulation of the VDR [128].
Conclusions on vitamin D intake/status and OA
Though it appears unlikely that vitamin D deficiency is a
causal factor in OA, there appear to be benefits for muscle
strength [116, 117] when patients maintain adequate vita-
min D status. Vitamin D deficiency is widespread across
the world [129]. Although both the Institute of Medicine
[54] and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [55]
consider that a dietary intake that achieves a serum
25(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/l is sufficient, other or-
ganizations prefer to define sufficiency as the higher value
of 75 nmol/l [130]. Clinicians should measure vitamin D
status in their OA patients and use the information in
Table 3 [54, 55] to ensure that their vitamin D status
reaches at least 50 nmol/l.
Vitamin K and OA
Vitamin K is a group of fat-soluble compounds, with two
naturally occurring forms, vitamin K1 (phylloquinones) and
vitamin K2 (menaquinones) [131]. Vitamin K1, synthesized

 by plants and algae, is the form most widely found in the
human diet, mainly in green leafy vegetables and oils [56].
Vitamin K2 is predominantly produced by bacteria [30].
Postulated role of vitamin K in OA
Aside from its role in the complement cascade [131], vita-
min K is involved in bone and cartilage mineralization [132,
133]; it is a cofactor for the enzyme g-glutamyl carboxyl-
ase, which is responsible for the g-carboxylation and func-
tionality of vitamin-K-dependent (VKD) proteins [132, 133].
VKD proteins found in bone and cartilage include matrix
Gla protein, periostin, gla-rich protein, gas 6 and osteo-
calcin. Inadequate vitamin K intake may lead to decreased
carboxylation of these VKD proteins, affecting functional
status [132] and resulting in abnormalities that parallel
those seen in OA [133].
Human evidence on vitamin K in OA
Studies addressing the effects of vitamin K on OA in vivo
are very limited and most have investigated only phyllo-
quinone. Cross-sectional studies have shown a positive
association between concentrations of plasma phyllo-
quinone <1.0 nM and the development of OA [134] and
an inverse association between knee OA and plasma
phylloquinone [135]. Furthermore, phylloquinone intake
has been inversely associated with individual and multiple
inflammatory markers [136]. In longitudinal studies, vita-
min K-deficient subjects were found to be more likely to
have articular cartilage and meniscus damage, often de-
veloping OA in one or both knees [137, 138].
Despite these promising results, the only randomized,
controlled trial of vitamin K failed to find a significant bene-
ficial effect of phylloquinone supplementation against
hand-OA progression [139]. However, only a subsection
of the group was vitamin K insufficient at baseline and, in
that subset, those who attained sufficient concentrations at
follow-up had 47% less joint space narrowing (P = 0.02).
Conclusions on vitamin K and OA
As the majority of epidemiological evidence thus far is
observational, causality cannot be demonstrated; how-
ever, the essential role of vitamin K in bone and cartilage
health is incontrovertible. Not all populations reach the
recommended vitamin K intake. Furthermore, there is no
gold-standard
biomarker
[140].
While
studies
from
Germany, America, the Netherlands, Japan and parts of
Northern China have shown adequate intake of vitamin K
according to guidelines [141�145], 59% of UK adults >65
years had an intake below recommendations, probably
because of inadequate consumption of cooked green
vegetables [146]. Guidance to increase vitamin K intake
is given in Table 3 [56].
Conclusions
Despite the limitations of evidence that is largely based on
observational studies, most of which are on knee OA, this
review can offer some guidance to clinicians. With excess
adiposity appearing to underlie the metabolic factors
now recognized as being integral to OA, particularly of
the hand and knee [28, 29], dietary modification to
achieve weight reduction where appropriate, together
with increased physical activity, are the strongest evi-
dence-based recommendations. Though the evidence
for benefit of dietary-lipid modification (increased LC n-3
PUFA/decreased LC n-6 PUFA) and lowering of serum
cholesterol on OA is currently somewhat sparse, the rec-
ommendations proposed will at least benefit metabolic
health.
While
vitamin/micronutrient
data
are
limited,
there is a plausible role for these nutrients in preventing/
slowing OA, though at what intake levels remains to
be seen. The accompanying patient-information sheet
(supplementary Fig. 1, available at Rheumatology online;
https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/OsteoArthritis.pdf)
summarizes potentially beneficial recommendations and
is designed for healthcare professionals to distribute to
their patients.
An ageing population and the current obesity epidemic
[147] predict an increased global burden of OA. Given the
current paucity of treatment options, any risk-free means
of reducing progression or relieving debilitating symptoms
in such a large patient group should be given a try. While
we await well-designed, larger scale RCTs in OA patients
of clearly defined phenotype, preferably relatively early in
the disease process, our findings could be used to sup-
port the development of guidelines using the Delphi pro-
cess of expert consensus to make recommendations.
