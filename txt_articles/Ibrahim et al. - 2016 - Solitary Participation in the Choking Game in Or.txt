abstract
OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare characteristics of youth who participate 
in the choking game alone versus those who participate in a group.
METHODS: Lifetime prevalence estimates were obtained from the 2011 (n = 5682) and 2013 
(n = 15 150) Oregon Healthy Teens survey. The 2011 and 2013 data sets were merged 
(N = 20 832) to compare youth who participate alone versus those who participate in a 
group in the choking game. Multivariate modeling was conducted to examine individual 
characteristics of young people who engaged in the choking game alone versus those who 
engaged in the game in a group.
RESULTS: In 2011, 3.8% of eighth-grade participants reported a lifetime prevalence of choking 
game participation; 3.7% reported lifetime prevalence of participation in 2013. In the 
merged 2011/2013 data set, 17.6% (n = 93) of choking game participants indicated that they 
had participated alone. Compared with those who reported participating in a group, youth 
who participated alone had significantly higher rates of suicide contemplation (odds ratio: 
4.58; P < .001) and poor mental health (odds ratio: 2.13; P < .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Youth who participate alone in the choking game are a particularly high risk 
group, exhibiting substantially higher rates of suicidal ideation and poorer mental health 
compared with youth who participate in the choking game in a group. Adolescent health 
care providers should be aware of these associations, assess whether prevention messaging 
is appropriate, and be prepared to explain the high risks of morbidity and mortality 
associated with participation.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Youth 
participation in a strangulation activity is associated 
with other high risk behaviors (eg, substance 
use, sexual activity, physical violence). Those who 
participate in the choking game alone versus in 
a group have the highest rates of morbidity and 
mortality.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Youth who participate 
in the choking game alone have higher odds of 
contemplating suicide and fair/poor emotional 
health compared with those who participate in 
groups. Adolescent providers should be aware of 
these associations and assess whether prevention 
messaging is appropriate.

Youth who engage in a strangulation 
activity, often referred to as 
the “choking game, 
” are at risk 
for significant injury or death. 
1 
Participation occurs when pressure 
(using hands/fingers or a ligature 
such as a belt or tie) is applied to 
the carotid artery to temporarily 
limit blood flow and oxygen. The 
goal is to achieve a euphoric feeling 
once the flow of oxygen and blood 
is restored to the brain. This activity 
puts participants at great risk for 
injury or death, particularly if they 
participate alone. 
1 Previous research 
has found that 96% of choking game 
deaths occurred when the participant 
was alone. 
1 Without other individuals 
present to interrupt the asphyxiation, 
there is an increased risk of loss of 
consciousness and inability to stop 
the strangulation when a noose, belt, 
or other ligature is being used.
Previous research has established 
general lifetime prevalence among 
youth at between 5% and 11%.

Determining an exact number of 
fatalities is difficult; the peer-reviewed 
literature reports 99 deaths, 
5 
but advocacy groups suggest that the 
number is >1000. 
6 Contributing to the 
lack of accurate mortality statistics 
is the fact that adolescent deaths 
due to asphyxial games, such as the 
choking game, are often misclassified 
as suicides or accidental deaths. 
7 
–

Contrary to early hypotheses that 
participation in the choking game was 
more common among youth with low 
rates of other health risks, 
10 more 
recent research has established that 
participation in the choking game 
is far more common among youth 
who experience substance use, poor 
mental health, violence, early-onset 
sexual activity, and other health risk 
behaviors, 
 
4, 
 
6, 
 
11 as well as those who 
have a thrill-seeking personality.

Awareness of the choking game and 
its risks is limited among youth, 
 
3, 
 
13 
parents, 
 
14, 
 
15 and providers.15, 
 
16 Little 
exists in the way of evidence-based 
education, prevention messages, 
or screening tools specific to this 
risk behavior. Earlier research 
has recommended that adolescent 
primary care providers consider 
incorporating questions about 
awareness and participation into a 
comprehensive adolescent well-care 
visit for youth who may exhibit other 
co-occurring risk behaviors, 
 
11 but the 
degree to which this questioning is 
occurring is unknown.
Oregon is the only state to have 
conducted statewide formal 
surveillance on this topic. The 
Oregon Public Health Division has 
made questions about prevalence 
(beginning 2008) and mode of 
participation (alone versus in 
groups, beginning 2011) a routine 
part of their biannual youth health 
surveillance effort (Oregon Healthy 
Teens [OHT] survey). Limited data 
suggest that the vast majority of 
deaths from the choking game occur 
when the participant is alone, 
 
1, 
 
6 
making it important to identify youth 
who do participate by themselves 
and understand how they may differ 
from their peers who participate in 
groups. The goal of the present article 
was to address that important gap in 
the literature by offering surveillance 
data on this population of solitary 
choking game participants.
The primary research question for 
the present study was as follows: 
Do youth who report participating 
alone in the choking game differ 
significantly in demographic 
characteristics or health risks from 
those youth who participated in 
the choking game in groups? Based 
on our knowledge of the increased 
health risks associated with solitary 
participation, we predicted that 
youth who participated alone would 
present higher levels of other health 
risks compared with those who 
participated in the choking game 
with other youth.
METHODS
Choking game awareness (ie, heard 
of someone participating), lifetime 
prevalence, and most recent mode 
of participation (ie, alone, in group) 
were analyzed by using data from 
the OHT survey ( 
Fig 1). The OHT is a 
population-based survey of Oregon 
eighth- and 11th-grade students, 
conducted in odd years, that is 
designed to measure the health and 
well-being of adolescents. The survey 
includes questions about physical 
and mental health, sexual activity, 
substance use, physical activity/
nutrition, absenteeism (number 
of school days missed due to any 
reason [emotional and/or physical 
reasons, and cutting class]) and 
community characteristics. The OHT 
survey began in 2001 as an annual 
survey and has been conducted in 
odd years since 2009. It is optional 
and anonymous and utilizes an 
active notification/passive consent 
parent policy where parents are 
notified about the survey and its 
contents and can elect to opt their 
students out of participation. More

All Oregon public secondary schools 
were included in the sampling frame. 
School districts were randomly 
sampled; in larger districts, schools 
were also randomly sampled from 
within those districts. OHT data were 
weighted to achieve a statewide 
representative sample based on 
the probability of students being 
selected. While OHT surveys both 8th 
and 11th grade students, questions 
about choking game participation 
are part of the 8th grade survey only; 
hence, all our results refer to 8th 
grade students.

Trends in Lifetime Choking Game 
Awareness and Participation
Prevalence rates for lifetime choking 
game awareness and participation 
were calculated separately for each 
year by using weighted data from the 
individual 2011 (n = 5682) and 2013 
(n = 15 150) OHT data sets.* 
Association Between Mode of 
Participation and Health Risks
Bivariate analysis and multivariate 
logistic regression analyses 
examining the relationship between 
solitary choking game participation 
(versus in groups) and specific 
health risks were conducted by using 
*Survey contractors and collection period 
changed between 2011 and 2013, leading to 
differences in sample size.
merged, unweighted data from 2011 
and 2013. Although each data set 
existed independently, the decision 
to merge 2 years of data without 
weights was made to increase sample 
size on a relatively rare outcome 
and to account for variability in 
weighting between years. 
17 Although 
estimates of prevalence may be 
slightly biased with unweighted 
data, we chose not to use weights 
in our logistic regression analysis 
because we were interested only in 
the presence, direction, and relative 
strength of associations between 
selected risk factor variables and 
group participation, which are 
largely unaffected by weighting. 
Furthermore, it is unclear to what 
extent weights developed for the 
population would apply to the subset 
of individuals used in that analysis.
Stata version 13.0 (Stata Corp, 
College Station, TX) was used to 
calculate descriptive statistics and 
odds ratios for the relationships 
between solitary choking game 
participation, demographic 
characteristics, and health risks. For 
the sake of consistency with previous 
research, this analysis included 
adjustment for geographic location 
(urban/rural) and sex.
RESULTS
Of the combined 20 832 students in 
eighth-grade who took the survey 
in 2011 and 2013, a total of 19 418 
answered the question on choking

game participation (93.2% response 
rate). A total of 529 of the 727 
choking game participants answered 
the question on participation type 
(72.7% response rate). Inconsistent 
answers were removed from analysis 
(eg, if a student said he or she 
had never participated in the first 
question but indicated a participation 
type in the second question).  
Table 1 
provides demographic characteristics 
for youth who responded to each of 
the 2 choking game questions.
Lifetime Choking Game Awareness 
and Participation
In 2011, 22.7% (95% confidence 
interval [CI]: 17.9–28.3) reported 
hearing of someone participating in 
the choking game, and 3.8% (95% 
CI: 2.8–5.2) participated themselves. 
In 2013, 17.2% (95% CI: 14.9–19.8) 
of Oregon eighth-grade students 
reported that they had heard of 
someone participating in the choking 
game, and 3.7% (95% CI: 3.2–4.4) 
reported personally participating in 
the choking game.
Association Between Mode of 
Participation and Health Risks
Of the 727 youth in the 2011/2013 
unweighted data set who indicated 
past participation in the choking 
game, 17.6% (CI: 14.3–20.8) reported 
that they were alone the last time 
they engaged in the choking game. 
Across our entire sample, prevalence 
of solitary participation in the 
choking game was 0.4%.  
Table 2 
displays results for each of the 2 
choking game questions.
Our assessment of bivariate 
relationships between health 
risks and solitary choking game 
participation indicated that, 
compared with youth who 
participated in groups, those 
who reported participating alone 
had significantly higher rates of 
poor mental health and feeling 
unsafe at school ( 
Table 3). Each of 
the variables with a statistically 
significant bivariate relationship was 
then put through a forward stepwise 
multivariate logistic regression, 
controlling for geographic location 
(urban/rural) and sex, to understand 
which variables are independently 
associated with solitary participation 
in the choking game.  
Table 3 displays 
the results of all health risk variables 
that were examined along with their 
unadjusted odds ratios and P values.
Results in the final model indicated 
that solitary participation was 
significantly associated with suicidal 
ideation and fair/poor emotional 
health status, when adjusted for sex 
and geographic location ( 
Table 4). 
No significant difference was 
found between solitary and group 
participants on variables related 
to substance use, sexual activity, 
exposure to violence, and physical 
health and nutrition.
DISCUSSION
Results from the present study 
indicate that youth who participate in 
the choking game alone have higher 
odds of contemplating suicide and 
reporting fair/poor emotional health

compared with those who participate 
in groups. To our knowledge, Oregon 
remains the only state to conduct 
systematic, statewide surveillance 
on the choking game among youth. 
Previous results demonstrated the 
association between choking game 
participation and health risks such 
as substance use and violence 
11 
and helped to raise awareness of 
participation as a potential issue 
to be addressed by adolescent 
health care providers. Because 
there is currently a gap in the 
literature on solitary participation 
and risk behaviors, the present 
study provides novel information 
on youth who are participating 
alone in this game and thereby 
have increased rates of morbidity/
mortality. Even among a group of 
youth at increased risk for substance 
use, violence, and poor mental 
health, those who participated in the 
choking game alone demonstrated 
exceptionally poor mental health 
and high rates of suicidal ideation. 
However, this association between 
solitary participation and suicide 
contemplation should not necessarily 
lead to the assumption that 
adolescents participating in the 
choking game while alone are doing 
so as a suicide attempt. Instead, those 
who participate alone may do so as 
an attempt to decrease psychological 
pain or distress, as is common among 
those who participate in nonsuicidal 
self-injury (NSSI). 
18
Although, by definition, NSSI is 
intentional self-injury without intent 
to die, individuals who engage in 
NSSI have been found to have greater 
rates of future suicidal thoughts 
and behaviors, indicating that NSSI 
may serve as a gateway behavior for 
suicide, and it should be identified 
and addressed with appropriate 
interventions. 
19 At least 1 study 
examined the overlap between any 
choking game participation and NSSI, 
with 6.5% of high school–aged youth 
reporting both behaviors in the past 
12 months in an Illinois sample; 
these youth were also found to report 
more suicidal behaviors compared 
with youth who reported only NSSI 
or only choking game behaviors.

Results of previous research, as well 
as the findings of the present study 
that point to increased suicide risk 
for youth who engage in the choking 
game alone, signify the need for 
additional examination of the overlap 
between these behaviors. The 
inclusion of questions related to NSSI 
within the OHT survey is needed to 
better understand this relationship 
and to more precisely classify and 
conceptualize solitary choking game 
behavior within the spectrum of 
self-directed violence or risk-taking 
behaviors
Previous research has shown that 
almost one-third of pediatricians 
and family physicians are unaware 
of the choking game, and only 
1.9% currently include choking 
game participation in anticipatory 
guidance.22 The present study 
provides salient information 
on health risk characteristics 
associated with solitary choking 
game participation among youth 
that can be used to support 
provider awareness and prevention 
messaging. In addition to using 
the adolescent well-care visit as 
an opportunity to assess risk for 
choking game participation, child 
and adolescent providers should 
be aware of the potential link 
between solitary participation 
and suicidal ideation/poor mental 
health. As made evident by our 
findings, solitary participation is 
associated with health conditions 
that indicate underlying distress, 
and it is important to assess whether 
youth who participate alone are 
also suicidal. Adolescents who 
engage in risky behaviors, such as 
substance use, increased sexual 
activity, and school absenteeism, 
have higher rates of participation 
in the choking game; participants at 
greater risk of poor mental health 
may be participating in the choking 
game alone, which is known to 
be associated with higher rates of 
morbidity and mortality. Providers 
should communicate about the 
increased morbidity and mortality 
rates associated with solitary 
participation and assess whether 
referrals to mental health services 
may be necessary.
Although our study contains a robust 
sample and continues to provide 
the only data on the choking game 
from statewide surveillance, it also 
has several limitations. One such 
limitation is that the choking game 
survey questions were not tested for 
reliability or validity, and therefore 
we do not know how well or 
consistently the students understood 
the questions and response 
categories. Previous research has 
indicated that almost all items from 
the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance 
Survey, upon which the OHT survey 
is based, have been found to have 
moderate to substantial test–retest 
reliability. 
15 However, this reliability 
would apply only to the covariate 
items and not the choking game 
questions themselves. In addition, 
the limited methodology associated 
with cross-sectional data analysis 
does not allow for a prospective 
assessment of risks. Third, because 
the survey is administered only 
to public schools in Oregon, it is 
not representative of the entire 
population: it excludes those who 
attend school in alternative settings, 
who are in juvenile detention, or who 
have dropped out of school. Lastly, 
because the merged data set was 
analyzed unweighted, it cannot be 
generalized to the state or to other 
locations.
CONCLUSIONS
Participation in the choking game 
among youth is an area of research 
with very little scientific data and 
understanding. Previous literature 
has sought to establish prevalence of 
participation and describe health risk 
profiles of those Oregon youth who 
participate, as well as to encourage 
adolescent providers to consider 
incorporating screening/prevention 
messaging related to the choking 
game in an adolescent well-care visit. 
The data presented in this article 
reveal how, even among a group of 
youth bearing substantial health 
risks, those with suicidal ideation 
and poor mental health have higher 
rates of solitary participation in the 
choking game. These youth could 
benefit from clear communication 
from their providers about the risks 
of participation (particularly alone) 
and consideration of referrals for 
mental health services.
