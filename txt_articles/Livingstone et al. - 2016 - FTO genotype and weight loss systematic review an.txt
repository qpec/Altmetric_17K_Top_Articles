ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To assess the effect of the FTO genotype on weight loss 
after dietary, physical activity, or drug based 
interventions in randomised controlled trials.
Design
Systematic review and random effects meta-analysis 
of individual participant data from randomised 
controlled trials.
Data sOurCes
Ovid Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane from 
inception to November 2015.
eligibility Criteria fOr stuDy seleCtiOn
Randomised controlled trials in overweight or obese 
adults reporting reduction in body mass index, body 
weight, or waist circumference by FTO genotype 
(rs9939609 or a proxy) after dietary, physical activity, 
or drug based interventions. Gene by treatment 
interaction models were fitted to individual participant 
data from all studies included in this review, using 
allele dose coding for genetic effects and a common 
set of covariates. Study level interactions were 
combined using random effect models. 
Metaregression and subgroup analysis were used to 
assess sources of study heterogeneity.
results
We identified eight eligible randomised controlled trials 
for the systematic review and meta-analysis (n=9563). 
Overall, differential changes in body mass index, body 
weight, and waist circumference in response to weight 
loss intervention were not significantly different 
between FTO genotypes. Sensitivity analyses indicated 
that differential changes in body mass index, body 
weight, and waist circumference by FTO genotype did 
not differ by intervention type, intervention length, 
ethnicity, sample size, sex, and baseline body mass 
index and age category.
COnClusiOns
We have observed that carriage of the FTO minor allele 
was not associated with differential change in 
adiposity after weight loss interventions. These 
findings show that individuals carrying the minor allele 
respond equally well to dietary, physical activity, or 
drug based weight loss interventions and thus genetic 
predisposition to obesity associated with the FTO 
minor allele can be at least partly counteracted 
through such interventions.

Introduction
The epidemic of obesity, together with its associated 
health burden, continues to spread globally.1  With an 
estimated 2.1 billion adults now overweight or obese,2 
 
there is an urgent need to develop more effective strate-
gies for preventing and managing obesity.3 
4  Genotype 
plays an important role in the development of obesity,5 
 
and recent genome wide association studies have iden-
tified multiple loci associated with body mass index6 
7 
 
and distribution of body fat.8  Specifically, 97 loci have 
been identified as accounting for about 2.7% of varia-
tion in body mass index,6  of which the fat mass and 
obesity associated (FTO) gene,9  melanocortin 4 recep-
tor (MC4R) gene,10  and transmembrane protein 18 
(TMEM18) gene11  have shown the strongest associa-
tions. Supplementary appendix 1 summarises the 
details of key genes associated with body mass index. 
However, so far the FTO gene explains the largest 
amount of the genetic variance in obesity traits over the 
lifespan.9  Those homozygous for the FTO (rs9939609) 
minor allele weigh on average 3 kg more and have a 1.7-
fold increased odds of being obese compared with 
those homozygous for the lower risk allele.12
To date, several intervention studies have explored 
the interaction between FTO genotype and lifestyle 
changes on adiposity.13-19  A study in 742 obese adults 
found that after a two year dietary intervention, those 
with the FTO minor allele had a 1.5 kg greater weight 
loss on a high protein diet but not on a low protein 
diet.16  Similarly, a six month moderate intensity

exercise intervention in 105 obese women resulted in up 
to twofold greater weight loss in carriers of the FTO 
minor allele compared with non-carriers.14  In contrast, 
a one year lifestyle intervention in 3548 adults showed 
smaller changes in adiposity in those with the FTO 
minor allele compared with those without,20  and a life-
style intervention in 502 participants found no effect of 
the FTO genotype on weight loss.21  Moreover, an analy-
sis of data from the Diabetes Prevention Programme 
(DPP) (n=1824) and the Action for Health in Diabetes 
study (Look AHEAD; n=3906), showed no effect of FTO 
genotype on weight loss.22
A recent meta-analysis by Xiang et al23  assessed the 
effect of the FTO genotype on weight change across sev-
eral randomised and non-randomised intervention stud-
ies. In the randomised controlled trials the authors 
averaged FTO effects on weight change across both inter-
vention and control arms of the studies under investiga-
tion and concluded that homozygous carriers of the FTO 
minor allele lost 0.44 kg (95% confidence interval 0.09 to 
0.79 kg); P=0.015) more weight than non-carriers.23  How-
ever, such averaging across study arms can be justified 
only in the absence of single nucleotide polymorphisms 
by treatment interactions, which were not tested by 
Xiang et al.23  This limitation, combined with the authors’ 
use of summary level data to assess the influence of par-
ticipant level characteristics—eg, age and body mass 
index at baseline, means that the findings are potentially 
misleading and subject to aggregation bias.23
We carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis 
to provide a critical analysis of the evidence that the 
FTO genotype influences changes in obesity related out-
comes in randomised weight loss interventions. In par-
ticular, we investigated whether the FTO genotype 
(rs9939609 or a proxy) predicted the magnitude of 
weight loss in response to a randomised weight loss 
programme. This analysis also employed individual 
participant data analyses to assess the role of partici-
pant level covariates.
Methods
Our systematic review was conducted according to 
Cochrane24  and the Centre for Reviews and Dissemina-
tion guidelines25  and is reported according to the pre-
ferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses guidelines.26 The protocol was registered 
with PROSPERO, the International Prospective Register 
of Systematic Reviews (CRD42015015969). An initial 
systematic literature search was undertaken to identify 
eligible studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Once 
eligible studies were identified, we invited the corre-
sponding authors of those studies to contribute individ-
ual participant data or to undertake a prescribed 
statistical plan (if individual participant data were not 
available for sharing). If authors did not reply, we 
excluded the corresponding studies from the meta-anal-
ysis but reported the study characteristics.
search strategy
We undertook an electronic search to identify interven-
tion studies reporting weight loss by FTO genotype 
(rs9939609 or a proxy) after a dietary, physical activity, 
or drug based intervention. Ovid Medline (www.nlm.
nih.gov/bsd/pmresources.html), Embase (www.
embase.com), and Scopus (www.scopus.com) were 
searched systematically for studies published from 
inception to November 2015. To determine other studies 
potentially eligible for inclusion we hand searched the 
reference lists of identified publications and previously 
published related systematic reviews. The search strat-
egy involved combining words from the concepts of 
genes, weight loss, and highly sensitive search filters for 
identifying randomised controlled trials for Ovid Med-
line and Embase24 
27 (see supplementary appendix 2 for 
the detailed search strategy).
study selection criteria
Included studies were randomised intervention studies 
in overweight or obese (body mass index ≥25) partici-
pants aged 18 years or more designed to induce weight 
loss (either as a primary or a secondary outcome) and 
that reported change in adiposity indices (body mass 
index, body weight, or waist circumference) by FTO 
genotype (rs9939609 or a proxy). Studies in non-over-
weight or non-obese participants (body mass index <25) 
and children (<18 years) were excluded. Only publica-
tions with an English language abstract were included. 
We included studies on men and women with or with-
out health risk factors (such as raised blood pressure, 
abnormal lipid levels, and metabolic syndrome).
Data extraction
Two reviewers (KML and JL) independently assessed 
publications for eligibility. The decision to include stud-
ies was hierarchical and made initially on the basis of the 
study title and abstract; when a study could not be 
excluded with certainty, the full text was obtained for 
evaluation. Discrepancies between reviewers were 
resolved through discussion with a third reviewer (CCM), 
and a consensus approach was used. Information 
extracted from studies included study design (interven-
tion type (dietary, physical activity, or drug intervention), 
length of follow-up, and country); participant character-
istics (age, sex, and ethnicity); description of measure-
ment methods; and information to assess the risk of bias. 
Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of 
bias tool (see supplementary appendix 3).24 Two review-
ers extracted data, one independently and the second 
confirming or completing information required.
statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 14.0 
software (Stata, College Station, TX) and Review Man-
ager (RevMan Version 5.1 for Windows Copenhagen; 
Nordic Cochrane Centre, Cochrane Collaboration, 
2015). A two step individual participant data analysis 
was undertaken, whereby individual data were first 
analysed separately by study and subsequently aggre-
gated using weighted meta-analyses.28 A common ana-
lytical plan was used for all studies under investigation, 
with covariate coding matched across studies as closely 
as possible. We checked summary level data in the log

files returned by researchers for consistency with the 
prescribed statistical plan. To ensure consistency in the 
pattern of results we compared all individual partici-
pant data analyses with the published studies.
Outcomes of interest were change in body mass 
index, body weight, or waist circumference between 
baseline and follow-up (change calculated as follow-up 
measurement minus baseline measurement). Linear 
regression analyses assessed change in the dependent 
variable (change in body weight, body mass index, or 
waist circumference) by FTO genotype (independent 
variable) separately by study arm, with FTO genotype 
coded using an allele-dose model (ie, number of copies 
of the minor allele). We adjusted arm specific models 
for age (continuous), sex, baseline outcome (body mass 
index, body weight, or waist circumference; continu-
ous), ethnicity (categorical), country or centre (categor-
ical), socioeconomic status (categorical), physical 
activity (continuous where possible), and smoking (cat-
egorical; see supplementary appendix 4). Participants 
were excluded from the analyses if they did not have 
complete data for all outcomes and covariates.
Table 2 presents two sets of regression coefficients. 
The first set of coefficients is arm specific and captures 
within arm change in the outcome during the course of 
the study for each copy of the FTO minor allele. Both 
treatment and control arms are included in these calcu-
lations. The second set of coefficients is intervention 
specific and captures mean differences in FTO allelic 
effects between treatment and control arms, where a 
negative coefficient indicates that individuals carrying 
a minor allele had a greater reduction in the outcomes 
of interest (weight, body mass index, or waist circum-
ference) after the intervention than those without the 
minor allele. So, for studies with K treatment arms and 
a single control arm, K+1 coefficients are used to cap-
ture FTO effects on within arm change scores (set 1), 
and K coefficients are used to capture FTO effects on 
treatment versus control differences in change scores 
(set 2). Importantly, the first set of coefficients is esti-
mated from separate groups of study participants, ren-
dering them statistically independent and facilitating 
standard error calculations for the second set of coeffi-
cients that capture the interaction effects of gene x 
treatment. However, the second set of coefficients uses 
a common control group for each study, which intro-
duces dependence at the study level.
This second set of regression coefficients from table 2 
was used to evaluate differences in FTO allelic effects on 
the outcomes of interest between intervention and control 
groups. We used random effects models to estimate the 
pooled effect sizes and to account for both sampling error 
and between study variation in population.29 Meta-esti-
mates were weighted by the inverse of the  
variance of the 
effect size (that is, 1 divided by variance), where variance 
took into account the two potential sources of variation 
(ie, variance within and between studies).
For studies with more than one active treatment arm 
and a single control arm, including all differences in 
treatment versus control in the meta-analysis shown in 
figure 2 would have invalidated the standard error 
 
calculations programmed into our meta-analytical pack-
ages, as these packages assume independent interven-
tion effects, not ones based on comparing different 
treatment arms with a shared control group. For such 
multi-arm studies, we used a fixed effect, inverse vari-
ance meta-analysis to produce an overall estimate of FTO 
effects across all treatment arms, in the absence of within 
study heterogeneity. We then compared that overall FTO 
effect across treatment arms with the FTO effect on the 
placebo arm, thus creating a single intervention versus 
control comparison for each study under consideration 
that satisfied statistical independence assumptions 
underlying standard error calculations. This method is 
recommended by Higgins et al30 to avoid excessive 
weightings from “double counts” originating from the 
control group shared by the multiple treatment arms.
A further complication arose because our meta-ana-
lytical packages required that intervention effects be 
entered in terms of mean differences, their standard 
deviation, and sample size. As the meta-analyses 
returned point estimates and their standard errors 
instead, we arbitrarily fixed our effective sample size for 
the combined intervention effect to the sum of the sam-
ple sizes of all K treatment groups in each study, and 
then back calculated the standard deviation required 
for the combined intervention effect to have the right 
level of precision. As the forest plot depends solely on 
the product of the standard deviation with the square 
root of the reported sample size, the arbitrariness in 
these calculations did not affect the validity of the for-
est plot itself.
Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using 
the I2 test and Galbraith plots31 and the 95% confidence 
interval for I2 calculated using the method of Higgins 
et al.32 33  Small study effects were appraised by visual 
inspection of funnel plots of effect size against the stan-
dard error, with asymmetry assessed formally with 
Egger’s test, chosen over Begg’s test for its greater spec-
ificity and power,34  where a P value less than 0.1 was 
considered as significant.35
To explore potential sources of heterogeneity, we con-
ducted moderation testing using intervention type (diet 
and diet and/or exercise), intervention length (≤6 months 
and >6 months), age (<50 years and ≥50 years), sex 
(binary), body mass index (<30 and ≥30), and race/eth-
nicity (white, black or African-American, and Hispanic) 
as putative categorical moderators. Between stratum 
comparisons in table 3 were used to test the hypothesis 
that the relation between FTO genotype and intervention 
effects on change in obesity related outcomes differed 
across levels of the moderator, whereas within stratum 
tests helped elucidate the nature of the interaction, if 
present. Variables employed as stratification factors were 
removed as covariates from the corresponding regression 
model. In addition, we investigated intervention length 
as a continuous variable in moderation analyses.
As a secondary analysis, we recoded FTO genotypes 
using a dominant model, where participants with one 
(AT) and two (AA) copies of the minor allele were 
grouped together and compared with those with no 
copies of the minor allele (TT).

Given that only one study20 included drug based 
interventions, we run a further sensitivity analysis 
where only the lifestyle intervention treatment arm was 
included. In a final set of sensitivity analysis, we 
removed from the analyses the study that contributed 
the most weight to the analyses (Look AHEAD).
To investigate whether changes in obesity outcomes 
were driven by associations between obesity outcomes 
at baseline and FTO genotype, additional linear 
regression analyses (presented in supplementary 
appendix 8) assessed relations between baseline 
 
values of the dependent variable (body weight, body 
mass index, or waist circumference) and FTO  
genotype 
(independent variable), where the FTO genotype was 
coded using an allele-dose model. These analyses 
were adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, country or centre, 
socioeconomic status, physical activity, and smoking 
and aggregated using a fixed effects, inverse variance 
meta-analysis.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
Searches yielded 2247 publications after removal of 
duplicates. One additional record was identified 
through other sources. Following screening (n=2248), 
2220 publications were excluded based on the titles and 
abstracts and 28 full text articles were assessed for eli-
gibility (fig 1 ). Full text articles were excluded from the 
qualitative synthesis because either they presented 
data from the same study (n=5) or they did not report 
results for FTO genotype (n=12). A total of 11 studies 
were eligible for inclusion in the qualitative synthesis. 
Three studies were excluded from the quantitative syn-
thesis (meta-analysis) because the authors did not reply 
to our request for access to data. A total of eight studies 
were included in the present meta-analysis.13-21 
36  Indi-
vidual participant data were analysed from all eight

data13 14 17 21 36  and three studies performed our pre-
scribed statistical analysis and provided summary level

study characteristics
The pooled population of the 11 studies eligible for 
inclusion in the qualitative synthesis comprised 10 000 
adults (table 1 ). After exclusion of participants without 
full data for outcomes and covariates (see supplemen-
tary appendix 5), the pooled population of adults 
included in the quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) 
was 9563. The mean age at baseline was 51.6 (range 
28-74) years and the mean body mass index was 32.2 
(23.8-43.2). All studies provided data for single nucleo-
tide polymorphism rs9939609, with the exception of the 
Dose Response to Exercise in Women aged 45-75 years 
(DREW) study,14 where rs8050136 was studied and is 
known to be in high linkage disequilibrium with 
rs9939609 (HapMap US residents of European ancestry: 
r2>0.84). Nine studies were in men and women and two 
studies in women only. Five studies were of dietary 
interventions, three of dietary and exercise based inter-
ventions, one of an exercise only intervention, and two 
of a drug and/or lifestyle intervention. The duration of 
follow-up ranged from eight weeks to three years. Stud-
ies were conducted in North America, South America, 
and Europe; six studies were in white participants and 
four in mixed populations (table 1).
study quality and small study effects
No studies were excluded from the meta-analysis based 
on quality assessment (see supplementary appendix 3). 
Visual inspection of funnel plots (see supplementary 
appendix 6) and Galbraith plots (see supplementary 
appendix 7) did not identify any systematic small study 
effects. Similarly, no significant bias was observed for 
body mass index (P=0.55), body weight (P=0.69), or 
waist circumference (P=0.39).

Table 2  summarises the minor allele effects (coefficient 
and standard error) on obesity outcomes after the 
weight loss intervention for each study and study arm. 
Table 2 also presents differences in minor allele effects 
between treatment and control arms, indicative of gene 
by treatment interactions. Mean treatment versus con-
trol differences in body mass index change for each 
copy of the FTO minor allele ranged from −0.33 (95% 
confidence interval −1.13 to 0.47) after six month fol-
low-up in DREW to 0.14 (−0.06 to 0.35) after one year in

by −0.06 (−0.43 to 0.31) cm; I2 0 (0 to 68; P=0.75) for each 
copy of the FTO minor allele after weight loss interven-
tion compared with that expected under naturalistic 
change in the control group (fig 2). When using a domi-
nant FTO genotype model (AA/AT v TT), body mass 
index, body weight, and waist circumference were 
reduced by 0.05 ((95% confidence interval −0.21 to 0.11); 
P=0.558), 0.15 ((−0.60 to 0.30) kg; P=0.524), and 0.22 
((−0.77 to 0.33) cm; P=0.437) after intervention in carri-
ers of the minor allele compared with non-carriers.
stratified and sensitivity analyses
The relation between FTO genotype and differences 
between treatment and control in change in obesity 
related outcomes (body mass index, body weight, and 
waist circumference) after weight loss interventions 
was not influenced by study type, study length, sex, 
race/ethnicity, or body mass index category (table 3). 
Change in body mass index for each copy of the FTO 
minor allele was significant in participants aged 50 or 
more years (β −0.23 (95% confidence interval −0.44 to 
−0.22); I2 0 (95% confidence interval 0 to 75); P=0.03), 
but not in participants aged less than 50 years (β −0.04 
(−0.26 to 0.18); I2 0 (0 to 75); P=0.75); however, the corre-
sponding moderation test failed to attain significance 
(P=0.21). In addition, intervention length modelled as a 
continuous variable did not significantly affect the rela-
tion between FTO genotype and differences between 
treatment and control in change in obesity related out-
comes (body mass index, body weight, and waist cir-
cumference) after weight loss interventions.
Given the presence of a gene x treatment interaction 
on waist circumference in table 3 between metformin 
and control arms in study DPP, we investigated 
 
exclusion of the metformin and troglitazone arms from 
DPP. This did not change the pattern of results (data not 
shown).
After removal of Look AHEAD, the largest study, over-
all effect sizes for body mass index, body weight, and 
waist circumference in figure 2 changed to −0.09 (−0.22 
to 0.04; P=0.17), −0.21 (−0.56 to 0.14) kg; P=0.25), and 
−0.01 (−0.45 to 0.42) cm; P=0.96), respectively, but failed 
to attain statistical significance.
baseline association testing
To facilitate better interpretation of any effect of FTO 
genotype on weight loss after an intervention, we inves-
tigated the association between FTO genotype and obe-
sity measures at baseline. FTO genotype differences in 
body mass index, body weight, and waist circumfer-
ence at baseline for each study are presented in supple-
mentary appendix 8. Collectively, for each copy of the 
FTO minor allele, body mass index, body weight, and 
waist circumference increased by 0.31 (0.14 to 0.47); 
P<0.001), 0.89 (0.45 to 1.32) kg; P<0.001), and 0.63 (0.28 
to 0.98) cm; P<0.001), respectively.
discussion
The present systematic review and meta-analysis used 
individual participant data to investigate the differen-
tial effect of FTO genotype on response to weight loss 
intervention in randomised controlled trials. Our 
meta-analysis of eight studies involving 9563 adults 
showed that carriage of the FTO minor allele does not 
influence change in adiposity measures in response to 
weight loss intervention, compared with treatment con-
trols. Since we observed a strong association of the FTO 
minor allele with greater adiposity at baseline, this neu-
tral effect of FTO minor allele on weight loss is an 
important finding for the development of effective 
weight loss interventions in the context of the global 
epidemic of obesity. Specifically, people who carry obe-
sity risk FTO genotypes respond equally well to weight 
loss treatment.
Our finding of the lack of a FTO genotype by treatment 
interaction on change in obesity related outcomes 
expands on a recent meta-analysis on the effect of FTO 
genotype on weight loss,23  which analysed FTO geno-
typic effects on weight change averaged across highly 
effective treatment arms and control arms that were 
designed to produce minimal to no weight change. 
Unlike Xiang et al, we included only randomised con-

non-randomised trials and limited within study bias and 
between study heterogeneity. Of the 10 studies included 
by Xiang et al, six overlapped with studies included in 
the present meta-analysis,13-17 21  with the remaining 
studies being either randomised controlled trials40 
 
where the authors did not agree to provide individual 
level data for the present analysis (n=1) or non-ran-
domised controlled trials (n=3).41-43 Moreover, we exam-
ined whether the effect of FTO genotype differed among 
those randomised to weight loss interventions com-
pared with those randomised to control groups. This 
was achieved by building on the strength of randomised 
controlled trials—namely, randomisation to distinct 
interventions to isolate causality of the intervention 
effect compared with a control group, and minimisation 
of biases between the intervention and control group in 
terms of demographics and baseline characteristics 
such as body mass. We also used individual participant 
data, which allowed us to adjust for the same set of 
covariates across all studies and to perform analyses 
stratified by participant characteristics and not study 
level summaries. This also facilitated comparisons 
between additive and dominant FTO genotype models. 
Moreover, our sample size was larger, which improved 
the power of our meta-analysis. Our findings suggest 
that when robust intervention design and analysis—
including gene by treatment arm interactions, individ-
ual participant data, and a large sample size—are used, 
there is no evidence that FTO genotype affects weight 
loss in response to lifestyle or dietary interventions.

67% (n=6472) of the total sample. Independently, 
 
neither study identified any association between FTO 
genotype and weight loss,15 20  which was consistent 
with parallel and pooled analysis of both studies22  and 
with our overall findings. In our sensitivity analyses, 
omission of the largest study (Look AHEAD15) did not 
change the pattern of results, thus supporting the 
robustness of our findings.
Although we identified a greater reduction in body 
mass index for each minor allele of FTO genotype in 
participants aged more than 50 years, this effect was 
not consistent across body weight and waist circumfer-
ence outcomes, suggesting that this is likely to be a 
chance finding. Nevertheless, recent metaregression 
estimates from twin studies suggest that heritability of 
body mass index was 0.07 (P=0.001) higher in children 
than in adults.44 Further research into possible sub-
group effects of FTO variants and other obesity related 
genes is warranted to confirm or refute our findings.
Although there is good evidence that the duration of 
the weight loss trial influences weight lost and 
regained,45  with greatest loss occurring at six months 
followed by gradual regain,46  we did not identify any 
effect of study duration on the relation between FTO 
genotype and weight loss. Behaviour change strategies 
for weight management seem to have limited effect in 
preventing relapse.45  In a pan-European study of 742 
adults, multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms were 
investigated for effects on weight regain over six months 
ad libitum diet after more than 8% weight loss, and the 
study investigated whether nutrient sensitive genes 
modified weight regain in response to glycaemic index 
and high protein based diets. No significant effects were 
found for the FTO single nucleotide polymorphisms, 
and although significant effects were found for several 
other single nucleotide polymorphisms, associations 
were no longer significant after adjustment for multiple 
testing.47  Furthermore, although a more recent study 
found evidence for the specific role of FTO genotype in 
predicting maintenance of body weight,40  results were 
based on a smaller (n=128), women only sample, and so 
the findings should be interpreted with caution. Given 
the lack of effective strategies for preventing weight 
regain and the evidence for an interaction between FTO 
genotype and physical activity on risk of obesity,48 fur-
ther research into the role of obesity related genes and 
their interactions with diet and physical activity on long 
term weight management are needed. Although the role 
of FTO, and other obesity associated genes, in weight 
maintenance was outside the scope of the present 
meta-analysis, it is an important consideration for max-
imising the long term health benefits of weight loss and 
should be considered in future research.
Weight loss in response to a lifestyle intervention 
requires negative energy balance to be sustained over a 
considerable period. This process is complex and 
involves behaviour changes in either or both, food con-
sumption (energy intake) and physical activity (energy 
expenditure). The mechanisms through which the FTO 
genotype could influence such processes are not 
known49 and might be different from those through 
table 3 | stratified analyses to identify potential moderators of relation between ftO genotype and intervention effects on change in obesity related outcomes

which the FTO genotype influences the development of 
excess adiposity.
strength and limitations of this review
A strength of this meta-analysis is that we jointly anal-
ysed individual participant data from eight randomised 
controlled trials using a standardised analysis strategy. 
Application of this standardised statistical analysis mit-
igated differences in study methodologies, utilised data 
independent of statistical significance or how results 
were reported initially, and improved the overall reli-
ability of the results. Moreover, our analysis included 
only randomised controlled trials, considered the ideal 
study design by avoiding many biases and confounding 
effects, and this approach allowed us to observe 
whether any differential effect of FTO genotype on 
weight loss is specific to weight loss interventions by 
comparing weight loss between participants ran-
domised to treatment arms and those randomised to the 
control arm. A further strength of our study was our 
ability to assess the effect of the FTO genotype on mul-
tiple measures of adiposity. Lastly, our study addresses 
the genetics and gene-lifestyle interactions of weight 
loss, a problem of public health importance, and fills a 
major gap in the literature on the putative role of FTO 
genotype in modulating weight loss in response to 
weight loss interventions.
An important limitation is that we evaluated the 
effect of FTO genotype only and, given that obesity risk 
and weight loss is influenced by multiple genes,50  the 
effect of other obesity related genes, such as MC4R and 
TMEM18, on weight loss in response to intervention 
remains to be determined. None the less, our findings 
are in line with those from the DPP and Finnish DPS 
trials, where participants with greater genetic risk for 
several known type 2 diabetes benefitted from lifestyle 
intervention equally well compared with those with 
lower risk.51 
52  Furthermore, we found a relatively small 
number of randomised controlled trials reporting 
weight loss by FTO genotype, all of which originated 
from North America and Europe, with predominantly 
white participants, which limited our power to investi-
gate differential effects between ethnicities. Given evi-
dence that the relation between FTO genotype and 
obesity varies by ethnicity,53  further well powered stud-
ies on this topic in ethnically different populations are 
warranted. In addition, we applied the same body mass 
index cut points for adiposity classification in Asian 
and other individuals,54  but, because Asians made up 
less than 5% of our total sample, this is unlikely to have 
impacted on our results. Given the evidence that both 
obesity risk and weight loss are modified by multiple 
genetic variants,55  our findings for FTO genotype 
should not be considered in isolation. A further limita-
tion is that the present analysis did not account for the 
diversity of intervention designs, where the type of diet 
or exercise intervention may induce differential weight 
loss through effects on metabolism, appetite, and 
 
thermogenesis56  although we found no interaction 
between intervention type (diet versus exercise) and 
FTO genotype on weight loss. In addition, weight loss 
interventions may be biased by higher dropout rates 
than in other randomised controlled trials,57 which may 
have influenced our ability to identify a relation 
between FTO genotype and weight loss. Lastly, the 
authors of three studies identified in the systematic 
review did not agree to provide individual participant or 
aggregate data and thus were excluded from the present 
analyses. These studies were small (total participants 
n=441) and thus their exclusion is unlikely to have 
affected our  
conclusions.
implications of the findings
We found that the FTO genotype had no detectable 
effect on weight loss in overweight and obese adults in 
response to intervention. Importantly, our findings 
show that the genetic predisposition to obesity associ-
ated with the FTO minor allele can be at least partly 
counteracted through dietary, exercise, or drug based 
weight loss interventions and that those carrying the 
minor allele respond equally well to such interventions. 
Moreover, our results suggest that screening for the FTO 
genotype in routine clinical work would not predict 
weight loss success. Future public health strategies for 
the management of obesity should aim to induce long 
term improvements in lifestyle behaviours, principally 
eating patterns and physical activity, since these will be 
effective in achieving sustained weight loss irrespective 
of FTO genotype.
Conclusions
This systematic review and meta-analysis of individual 
participant data reveals that carriage of the FTO minor 
allele, associated with risk of obesity in the general 
population as well as baseline adiposity in the present 
study, was not associated with changes in body mass 
index, body weight, or waist circumference in response 
to weight loss intervention. Our findings show that 
weight loss in those carrying the FTO minor allele is 
similar to the rest of the population after dietary, exer-
cise, or drug based interventions. Future studies should 
investigate the possibility that a panel of genetic vari-
ants, including other FTO genotypes, may modulate 
weight loss in obese people in response to lifestyle and 
other interventions.
