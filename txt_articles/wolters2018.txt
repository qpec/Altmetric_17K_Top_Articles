IMPORTANCE Risk of major stroke is high during the hours and days after transient ischemic
attack (TIA) and minor stroke but is substantially reduced by urgent medical treatment. Public
education campaigns have improved the response after major stroke, but their association
with behavior after TIA and minor stroke is uncertain. The number of potentially preventable
early recurrent strokes in patients who delay or fail to seek medical attention is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association of public education with delays and failure in
seeking medical attention after TIA and minor stroke.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective population-based study of all patients with
TIA or stroke who sought medical attention between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2014,
registered at 9 general practices in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. Data analysis took place
from July 1, 2013, to March 2, 2015.
EXPOSURES Face, Arm, Speech, Time (FAST) public education campaign in the United
Kingdom.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of early recurrent strokes in patients who delayed
or failed to seek medical attention, as well as the odds of seeking urgent attention after TIA
and minor stroke before vs after initiation of the public education campaign.
RESULTS Among 2243 consecutive patients with first TIA or stroke (mean [SD] age,
73.6 [13.4] years; 1126 [50.2%] female; 96.3% of white race/ethnicity), 1656 (73.8%) had a
minor stroke or TIA. After the FAST campaign, patients with major stroke more often sought
medical attention within 3 hours (odds ratio [OR], 2.56; 95% CI, 1.11-5.90; P = .03). For TIA
and minor stroke, there was no improvement in use of emergency medical services
(OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.50-1.23; P for interaction = .03 vs major stroke) or time to first seeking
medical attention within 24 hours (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.48-1.19; P for interaction = .006
vs major stroke). Patient perception of symptoms after TIA and minor stroke was associated
with more urgent behavior, but correct perception declined after the FAST campaign
(from 37.3% [289 of 774] to 27.6% [178 of 645]; OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80; P < .001).
One hundred eighty-eight patients had a stroke within 90 days of their initial TIA or stroke, of
whom 93 (49.5%) followed unheeded TIAs for which no medical attention was sought,
similar before and after the FAST campaign (43 of 538 [8.0%] before vs 50 of 615 [8.1%]
after, P = .93).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study suggests that in contrast to major stroke, extensive
FAST-based public education has not improved the response to TIA and minor stroke in the
United Kingdom, emphasizing the need for campaigns that are tailored to transient and less
severe symptoms.

hen left untreated, approximately 5% of patients
with transient ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke
have a major stroke within 24 hours, comprising
more than 40% of all recurrent strokes within 30 days.1 Ur-
gent investigation and medical treatment substantially re-
duce risk of early recurrent stroke,2,3 as could initial self-
medication with aspirin alone.4 Consequently, guidelines
recommend that patients with high-risk TIA should be as-
sessed urgently.5-7 However, patients frequently fail to recog-
nize or act on TIA symptoms, either delaying seeking medical
attention8,9 or not seeking medical attention at all.10,11 The
number of potentially preventable early recurrent strokes that
consequently go unprevented is unknown, although recent
public education campaigns designed to increase recogni-
tion of major stroke symptoms might change behavior after
TIA.
The Face, Arm, Speech, Time (FAST) test was adopted as
a tool to improve symptom recognition after stroke12,13 and
has formed the basis of public education in many countries,
including the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States,
Australia, and New Zealand, with variants in several
non–English-speaking countries. The FAST test was used in
an ongoing television public awareness campaign in the
United Kingdom from 2009 onward. It appears to have
improved the response after major stroke,14-17 but the asso-
ciation of the campaign with patient behavior after TIA and
minor stroke has not been determined and may well differ
given differences in event duration, severity, and coverage
by the FAST acronym.
We prospectively studied patient perception and behav-
ior after TIA and stroke in a population-based study before and
during the ongoing FAST campaign. We also investigated the
number of early strokes after a TIA for which no medical at-
tention is sought.
Methods
Ethical Approval
The Oxford Vascular Study (OxVasc) was approved by the
Oxfordshire Research Ethics Committee and included use of
routinely collected health care data for investigating inci-
dence rates without consent. Written informed consent or
assent was obtained from all participants for additional
data.
Study Design
The OxVasc is a population-based study of all acute vascular
events,includingTIAandstrokein92 728individualsofallages
registered with 100 collaborating primary care physicians at
9 general practices in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. The
OxVasc study methods have been described previously18 and
are recounted in the online methods (eFigure in the Supple-
ment).ThepresentarticleincludesallconsecutiveincidentTIA
and stroke cases, with the exception of subarachnoid hemor-
rhages, occurring outside the hospital between April 1, 2002,
and March 31, 2014. Data analysis took place from July 1, 2013,
to March 2, 2015.
Most patients were seen in the dedicated study TIA and
stroke clinics or were admitted to the acute stroke service at
the principal center (John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United
Kingdom) serving the study population. Patients provided
informed consent (or assent was obtained from relatives)
and were seen by study physicians (among whom were
F.J.W., L.L., and P.M.R.) for structured interview using a
standard questionnaire as soon as possible after initial pre-
sentation to assess their perception about the event and
immediate response to symptoms, including date and time
of symptom onset, when medical attention was sought and
by whom, the first contact with emergency medical services
(EMS), and why they did not seek medical attention
straightaway in case of delay to medical attention exceeding
3 hours. Patients were routinely questioned about any neu-
rological symptoms within 90 days before their presenting
event (ie, unheeded TIAs) and were followed up for recur-
rent cerebrovascular events (eFigure in the Supplement).18
Baseline characteristics, including demographic data, self-
reported race/ethnicity, and risk factors for stroke (based on
prior diagnosis and current medication use), were recorded,
and assessments were made for severity of the event using
the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale. Major stroke
was defined as a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale
score exceeding 3. Socioeconomic status was assessed
according to the United Kingdom’
s 2007 indexes of
deprivation.19 Based on these indexes, the electoral districts
covering our population are less deprived than the rest of
the United Kingdom, but still 22% of our districts rank in
the lower one-third nationally. Further data were acquired
from medical records, ambulance sheets, general practi-
tioner referral letters, and consultation notes. Consent for
access to this information was obtained from all participat-
ing patients.
To best reflect the response of patients to symptoms, time
of symptom onset was defined as time of awaking if onset of
stroke was during sleep. In patients unable to call for help, time
of symptom onset was considered the moment another per-
sonnotedtheirsymptoms.EventswereclassifiedasFASTposi-

Key Points
Questions What is the number of potentially preventable early
recurrent strokes in the United Kingdom among patients who
delay or fail to seek medical attention, and has extensive public
education changed patient response?
Findings Among 2243 consecutive patients with transient
ischemic attack or stroke in this population-based study, extensive
Face, Arm, Speech, Time (FAST)–based public education has not
improved the response to transient ischemic stroke and minor
stroke. The percentage of strokes preceded by a transient
ischemic attack for which no attention was sought remained
unchanged.
Meaning Public education campaigns tailored to transient and
less severe symptoms are needed to encourage urgent patient
response to imminent stroke warning signs.

present at symptom onset.
FAST Campaign in the United Kingdom
The initial FAST public education television campaign in the
United Kingdom ran from February through April 2009, with
8 weeks of national television broadcasts. With initiation of
the 2009 campaign, the T in FAST was redesignated “Time to
call 999” (ie, EMS) rather than “Test all 3.” Repeated televi-
sion campaigns ran intermittently for several weeks from
October 2009 to early 2010, for 6 weeks in March and April
2011, and for 4 weeks in March 2012, March 2013, and March
2014 and are now continued on a yearly basis. The total cam-
paign investment from 2009 to 2013 was £10.2 million
(US $13.6 million). The impact of the campaign as measured
by television viewer ratings (1 television viewer rating equals
1%ofthetargetaudienceofalladults,includingmultipleviews)
was 274 in 2012 and 317 in 2013. In October 2005, there was a
preceding small-scale 18-month public transport poster
campaign.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses included all first TIA and first stroke occurring out-
side of the hospital during the study period, with the excep-
tion of analyses of patient perception, which excluded pa-
tients with reduced consciousness, event-related confusion,
or dysphasia. We analyzed patient behavior before April 1,
2009, and after April 1, 2009 (ie, the end of the first major
2-month television campaign) and stratified the analyses
(ie, assessed behavior per year of the study) into study years.
To assess any association of the FAST campaign with the num-
ber of strokes in our study population that could potentially
have been prevented by urgent patient behavior after initial
symptoms of a TIA, we assessed the number of all 90-day re-
current ischemic strokes preceded by an unheeded TIA. To-
gether with all 90-day recurrences after heeded events, these
constitute all early recurrent strokes. We compared the un-
heeded TIAs with the TIAs in patients who sought medical at-
tention and extrapolated the OxVasc population rates
(numberofunheededTIAsdividedbytheOxVascsourcepopu-
lation per 10 years) to the general population to estimate the
numberofpotentiallypreventablestrokesafterunheededTIAs
annually.
Time from TIA or stroke symptom onset to first seeking
medical attention and the nature of the first medical atten-
tion sought—defined as emergency (ie, direct contact with am-
bulance services or presentation to an emergency depart-
ment) vs nonemergency (ie, the first contact with a general
practitioner or other local health care professional)—were also
compared before vs after April 1, 2009, within clinically rel-
evant timing cutoffs of 3 and 24 hours by performing χ2 test
and computing Mantel-Haenszel test odds ratios (ORs). To fur-
ther assess time trends, the first contact with EMS vs non-
EMS was analyzed per year of the study. Subsequent adjust-
ment was made for time trends and age, sex, race/ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, cohabitation, National Institutes of
Health Stroke Scale and ABCD2 (age, blood pressure, clinical
features of the TIA, duration of symptoms, and history of dia-
betes) scores, onset during sleep, and occurrence during the
weekend20bymeansofsegmentedregressionanalysis,21break-
ing down time to months and again using April 1, 2009, as the
change point. Missing data for covariates in this model were
imputed (eTable 1 in the Supplement). We formally assessed
fordifferentialassociationsoftheFASTcampaignbyeventtype
(TIA and minor stroke vs major stroke) by testing for multi-
plicative interaction in the fully adjusted time-series regres-
sion model.
Weassessedtheassociationofperception(classifiedascor-
rect [ie, TIA, stroke, or ministroke] vs incorrect) with subse-
quent behavior, as well as the proportion of patients with cor-
rectinitialperceptionofsymptomsbeforevsafterApril1,2009,
in relation to presence of FAST symptoms. Finally, we re-
peated the trends analyses, comparing only the 5 years imme-
diately before April 1, 2009, vs the subsequent 5 years. All
analyses were performed using a software program (SPSS Sta-
tistics, version 21.0; IBM). Two-sided α level (type I error) was
set at .05.
Results
Among 2243 consecutive patients with first TIA or stroke in
the study period (mean [SD] age, 73.6 [13.4] years; 1126 [50.2%]
female; 96.3% of white race/ethnicity), 825 (36.8%) were ini-
tially seen with TIA, 831 (37.0%) with minor stroke, and 587
(26.2%) with major stroke. Baseline characteristics of pa-
tients (1231 pre-FAST and 1012 post-FAST) are listed in eTable
1 in the Supplement. Data on who sought medical attention
were available in 2003 patients (89.3%), and data on first cli-
nicianwereavailablein2196patients(97.9%).Timefromevent
to call for medical attention and hospital arrival was un-
known in 209 patients (9.3%), most commonly because of
unconsciousness, dysphasia, dementia, or early death and
unavailability of an alternative informant.

(22.8%) and 125 of 771 (16.2%), respectively; upper limb motor
symptoms in 307 of 785 (39.1%) and 224 of 770 (29.1%), respec-
tively; and speech disturbance in 307 of 810 (37.9%) and 351 of

throughout the week. Weekend presentation of TIA or minor
stroke vs major stroke was 267 of 1537 (17.4%) vs 155 of 575
(27.0%) (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45-0.71; P < .001). These findings
were similar before and after April 1, 2009.

 Patient Presentation Before and After the FAST Campaign
For major stroke, use of nonemergency services (chiefly a gen-
eral practitioner) declined steeply from 2009 onward
(Figure 2B). Use of EMS was 58.8% before April 1, 2009,
vs 78.9% after April 1, 2009 (OR, 2.63; 95% CI, 1.80-3.82;
P < .001)(Table1).Moreover,firstmedicalattentionwassought
more quickly after April 1, 2009, than before April 1, 2009
(Figure2D).Firstmedicalattentionwasobtainedwithin3hours
in 67.6% (198 of 293) before April 1, 2009, vs in 81.3% (204 of
251) after April 1, 2009 (OR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.40-3.11; P < .001).
Taking into account time trends and potential confounding
variables,thesechangeslargelycoincidedwithinitiationofthe
FAST campaign (Table 2). For TIA and minor stroke, medical
attention was also sought more often directly via EMS after
April 1, 2009, occurring in 21.9% before April 1, 2009, vs in
30.9%afterApril1,2009(OR,1.60;95%CI,1.28-2.00;P < .001)
(Table 1). However, this increase was not significantly associ-
ated with the FAST campaign in a time-series analysis
(Figure 2A). The change was attributable to a baseline trend
(OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.00-1.02; P = .009) rather than to the cam-
paign (adjusted OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.50-1.23; P = .29) (Table 2).
Time to first seeking medical attention after TIA and minor
stroke was similar before and after April 1, 2009. Medical at-
tention was obtained within 3 hours in 42.1% (384 of 912)
before April 1, 2009, vs in 40.4% (298 of 737) after April 1, 2009
(OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.77-1.14; P = .49), and was obtained within
24 hours in 70.4% (612 of 869) before April 1, 2009, vs in 70.6%
(493 of 698) after April 1, 2009 (OR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.81-1.26;
P = .93), and did not change substantially during the course of
the study (Table 2 and Figure 2C). The observed association
of the FAST campaign with response to TIA and minor stroke
differedsignificantlyfromtheassociationwithresponsetoma-
jor stroke for both use of EMS (P for interaction in the time-
series analysis = .03 vs major stroke) and time to first seeking
medicalattentionwithin24hours(Pforinteractioninthetime-
series analysis = .006 vs major stroke). Results were similar for
TIA and minor stroke and when restricting analyses to 5 years
before and 5 years after initiation of the campaign.
Stroke After Unheeded TIAs
Ninety-five patients who had sought attention for an initial TIA
or stroke had a first or recurrent stroke by 90-day follow-up. In
addition, 93 patients with stroke reported having symptoms of
a TIA for which they had not sought medical attention during
the90daysbeforetheirpresentingstroke.Therefore,therewere
188earlystrokesafterinitialTIAorstrokeinallpatients,inwhom
93 (49.5%) occurred after a TIA for which no medical attention
was sought. This number of strokes preceded by an unheeded

 TIA was similar before and after the FAST campaign (43 of 538
[8.0%] before vs 50 of 615 [8.1%] after, P = .93). The median in-
terval from the first unheeded TIA to a stroke was 6 days
(interquartile range [IQR], 1-17 days). The median duration of
unheeded TIAs was 20 minutes (IQR, 5-60 minutes).
Thirty-two of 93 patients (34.4%) with unheeded TIAs preced-
ing their stroke had more than one TIA before stroke occur-
rence. Among all 93 patients with unheeded TIAs preceding
stroke, 69 (74.2%) were not taking antiplatelet medication or
oral anticoagulants at the time of their stroke. Compared with
TIAs for which medical attention was sought, unheeded TIAs
were shorter, more often consisted of a single symptom only,
and were less likely to disturb speech (Table 3). Only 34.8% of
those with unheeded TIAs had any symptom covered by the
FASTacronym.PatientswithunheededTIAswerealsoyounger,
weremoreoftenmale,residedinmoresociallydeprivedneigh-

after heeded TIA occurred despite specialized hospital care
within 24 hours (67.4% [58 of 86 for whom data were avail-
able]) or 72 hours (87.2% [75 of 86]) of the initial event.
Patient Perception of Symptoms
In 1419 patients without severe speech disturbance, cogni-
tive impairment, or event-related confusion after TIA or
minor stroke who provided their initial perception of symp-
toms, 467 (32.9%) correctly attributed these to TIA or
stroke. Patients with correct perception sought medical
attention more quickly (241 of 438 [55.0%] when correct vs
337 of 887 [38.0%] when incorrect within 3 hours; OR, 1.45;
95% CI, 1.18-1.77; P < .001) and were more likely to directly
contact EMS (130 of 458 [28.4%] when correct vs 193 of 946
[20.4%] when incorrect; OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.20-2.00;
P = .001) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). Correct perception
of symptoms after TIA and minor stroke was less common
after April 1, 2009, compared with before April 1, 2009
(from 37.3% [289 of 774] to 27.6% [178 of 645]; OR, 0.64;
95% CI, 0.51-0.80; P < .001), particularly in FAST-positive
cases (eTable 3 in the Supplement). Decline in correct per-
ception was seen for both TIA and minor stroke and was
similar for low-risk and high-risk TIA. Among 245 of 588
patients (41.7%) with major stroke who provided their initial

 perception of symptoms, perception was correct in
116 patients (47.3%) but was not associated with the propor-
tion contacting EMS (54.5% [61 of 112] when correct
vs 53.6% [67 of 125] when incorrect; OR, 1.04; 95% CI,
0.62-1.73; P = .89) or time to seeking first medical attention
(median, 60 minutes [IQR, 10-173 minutes] when correct vs
60 minutes [IQR, 15-537 minutes] when incorrect; P = .12).
In most major strokes (483 of 543 [89.0%]), first medical
attention was sought by someone other than the patient.
For TIA and minor stroke, 52.5% (767 of 1460) of patients
did not call for medical aid themselves but relied on their
spouse (373 [25.5%]), another relative or close acquaintance
(262 [17.9%]), a bystander (63 [4.3%]), or staff at a care
home (61 [4.2%]). Seventy-five of 1460 patients (5.1%) did
not report symptoms to a health care professional until a
routine appointment with a physician. The proportion of
patients seeking medical attention themselves was similar
for TIA and minor stroke and was unaltered before vs after
April 1, 2009. Data on the initial diagnostic impression of
relatives or bystanders were not collected.
Reasons for Delay in Seeking Medical Attention
Of 864 patients with TIA or minor stroke who delayed
seeking medical attention more than 3 hours, 654 (75.7%)
provided a reason, usually attributing symptoms to another
(less harmful) cause (157 [24.0%]), being reassured by or
awaiting improvement of symptoms (153 [23.4%]), not being
worried about initial symptoms (145 [22.2%]), or not seek-
ing medical attention because symptom onset occurred out-
side of office hours (50 [7.6%]) (eTable 4 in the Supple-
ment). Reasons for delay were similar for TIA and minor
stroke (eTable 4 in the Supplement) and were essentially
unchanged before and after April 1, 2009.
Discussion
In contrast to major stroke, we found in this study that for TIA
and minor stroke the UK nationwide televised FAST cam-
paign has not improved patient use of EMS or patient delay in
seekingmedicalattention.Moreover,thepercentageofstrokes
that followed shortly after an initial TIA for which no medical
attentionwassoughtremainedunchangedaftertheFASTcam-
paign, representing approximately 100 potentially prevent-
able strokes per 1 million inhabitants annually.
It is likely that many individuals experience transient neu-
rological symptoms for which they do not seek medical atten-
tion and do not have stroke. The results of large randomly di-
aled telephone studies10,11 have suggested that approximately
15% of people in the general population had experienced tran-
sient neurological symptoms during the previous few years,
such as weakness, numbness, or visual problems. Although we
cannot determine the total number of unheeded TIAs in our
study population, we found that the share of strokes pre-
ceded by symptoms suggestive of TIA in the community for
which no medical attention is sought has remained un-
changed after the FAST campaign, affirming that these ig-
noredeventsareanimportanttargetforstrokeprevention.The
large number of patients with TIA during the weekend who
seek medical attention only days later during office hours em-
phasizes that less severe or shorter-lasting symptoms are not
thought to require immediate medical attention, with no re-
duction since the FAST campaign. Seventy-five percent
(70 of 93) of patients with stroke after unheeded TIAs were not
taking antithrombotic medication, highlighting the missed op-
portunity for secondary prevention.2-4 Given the high effec-

 afterTIA,4theinfluenceofpubliceducationwilldependlargely
on its ability to convince patients to take action within this cru-
cial window of time.
Use of EMS has repeatedly been shown to be one of the
most important factors in early hospital arrival after TIA and
minor stroke.8,9,22,23 We observed no positive association of
the FAST television campaign with presentation via EMS af-
ter TIA and minor stroke. Even when patients attributed their
symptoms to stroke, still less than one-third (130 of 458) con-
tacted EMS, which is in line with the findings of a 2012 UK
survey.24 Studies14-17 have indicated a moderate influence of
public education on presentation after stroke, but no pub-
lished studies to date have assessed the effect of large public
education campaigns on presentation after TIA and minor
stroke. Compared with major stroke, one of the main differ-
ences we found in the response to TIA and minor stroke is the
high association of symptom recognition with subsequent be-
havior in the latter. While severe symptoms require medical
aidregardlessoftheircause,transientorminorsymptomsmay
leave room for deliberation and attribution of symptoms to
other (less worrisome) causes. A population-based survey in
the United Kingdom recently showed that, despite recall of the
FAST campaign, recognition and the response to hypotheti-
cal stroke scenarios did not improve.25 The decline in correct
recognition of symptoms that we observed after extensive
FAST-based public education campaigns suggests that pa-
tients may be falsely reassured when their symptoms do not
match the more severe symptoms depicted in public educa-
tion advertisements.26 The limited sensitivity of the FAST ac-
ronym for TIA and minor stroke (approximately 60% vs 95%
for major stroke based on the Results section herein) may fur-
ther explain the lack of positive influence of the campaign in
this group of patients and emphasizes the need for adapted
forms of public education.
Limitations
Although we believe that our findings are valid and should
guidefuturepubliceducation,therearesomelimitations.First,
the retrospective diagnosis of unheeded TIAs preceding stroke
is inevitably subjective and may be subject to recall bias. How-
ever, we applied the same diagnostic criteria that we apply
when making a diagnosis acutely after a TIA, and we will have

 underestimated unheeded TIAs preceding major stroke in pa-
tients who were unable to report these because of drowsi-
ness, dysphasia, or dementia. Moreover, although we al-
lowed a 90-day cutoff for preceding TIA to limit recall bias of
distant events, most TIAs occurred within the week before the
stroke and mirrored previous prospective investigations of the
natural history of stroke risk after TIA.1 Second, we did not re-
cord the diagnostic perception of bystanders or relatives, nor
did we directly ask about individual exposure to and aware-
ness of the campaign. Third, increased but slow presentation
of otherwise nonpresenters after the FAST campaign may have
biased time trends of TIA and minor stroke toward the null.
Fourth, in view of the small fraction of people in our study who
were of nonwhite race/ethnicity, our results may not be fully
applicable to racial/ethnic minorities, who have previously
been reported to delay to presentation longer.8
Conclusions
In our study, a lack of improvement in patient response to TIA
and minor stroke was found after extensive FAST-based pub-
liceducationtelevisioncampaignsintheUnitedKingdom.This
highlights the need for effective public education to be tai-
lored to transient and minor stroke symptoms, as well as
major stroke.
