ABSTRACT
Background: Although animal studies have shown that exposure to
glyphosate (a commonly used herbicide) does not result in glyph-
osate bioaccumulation in tissues, to our knowledge there are no
published data on whether it is detectable in human milk and there-
fore consumed by breastfed infants.
Objective: We sought to determine whether glyphosate and its
metabolite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA) could be detected
in milk and urine produced by lactating women and, if so, to quan-
tify typical consumption by breastfed infants.
Design: We collected milk (n = 41) and urine (n = 40) samples from
healthy lactating women living in and around Moscow, Idaho and
Pullman, Washington. Milk and urine samples were analyzed for
glyphosate and AMPA with the use of highly sensitive liquid chroma-
tography–tandem mass spectrometry methods validated for and op-
timized to each sample matrix.
Results: Our milk assay, which was sensitive down to 1 mg/L for
both analytes, detected neither glyphosate nor AMPA in any milk
sample. Mean 6 SD glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine
were 0.28 6 0.38 and 0.30 6 0.33 mg/L, respectively. Because of
the complex nature of milk matrixes, these samples required more
dilution before analysis than did urine, thus decreasing the sensitiv-
ity of the assay in milk compared with urine. No difference was
found in urine glyphosate and AMPA concentrations between sub-
jects consuming organic compared with conventionally grown foods
or between women living on or near a farm/ranch and those living in
an urban or suburban nonfarming area.
Conclusions: Our data provide evidence that glyphosate and AMPA
are not detectable in milk produced by women living in this region
of the US Pacific Northwest. By extension, our results therefore sug-
gest that dietary glyphosate exposure is not a health concern for
breastfed infants. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as
NCT02670278.

INTRODUCTION
Glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine), a widely used
herbicide patented as a phytotoxicant in 1974 (1), functions by
blocking the activity of 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate
synthase (Enzyme Commission number 2.5.1.19), an enzyme
required for the synthesis of tryptophan, phenylalanine, and
tyrosine in plants and some microorganisms (2–5). Because
these amino acids are not synthesized by humans, glyphosate
would not be expected to have a physiological effect. Indeed, the
human genome does not encode for 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-
phosphate synthase, and a large body of epidemiologic and
experimental literature supports the safety of glyphosate in
mammals (5, 6). In addition, neither glyphosate nor its metab-
olite aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA)8 seem to bio-
accumulate in animal tissues (7–9). In addition, most scientific
evidence does not support contentions that glyphosate may
cause cancer in humans, as recently concluded after a lengthy
review by the European Food Standards Authority (10). The US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authorized the use
of glyphosate as an herbicide in noncrop and industrial areas
since 1974 and in agriculture since 1976 (11). The safety of
glyphosate use as an herbicide is periodically re-evaluated, with
the last federal review completed in 1993 (12).
Despite its long-standing track record for safety, decades of
research have resulted in a vast body of literature related to the
clearance and disposition of ingested glyphosate. Studies in
humans show that w20% of diet-derived glyphosate is absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract, with the remaining w80% ex-
creted in the feces (13, 14), and studies conducted with rats
suggest that nearly all absorbed glyphosate is rapidly excreted

 unchanged in urine (9, 15–18); little, if any, is metabolized to
and excreted as AMPA. In fact, most AMPA in urine is thought
to be the result of either the consumption of plants that have
metabolized glyphosate into AMPA (12, 18, 19) and/or exposure
to phosphonates found in detergents (20, 21).
Several studies have also investigated urine glyphosate con-
centrations of humans exposed to glyphosate via diet and other
environmental sources (14, 22–25). These studies have consis-
tently documented urine glyphosate concentrations of w1–3 mg/L
(in ppb), with the highest value being 233 mg/L (24). Curwin
et al. (26) also reported urine glyphosate concentrations in 116
children living in “farm” and “nonfarm” households. Most
samples (84%) had detectable concentrations with values similar
to those reported in adults. There was no difference in urine
glyphosate concentrations between children living in farm and
nonfarm households (27). It is noteworthy that all measured
urine glyphosate concentrations to date, even the highest, have
not warranted a legitimate health concern based on the European
Food Safety Authority’s allowable daily intakes and allowable
operator exposure concentrations (14).
Of particular interest to our research group is the potential
glyphosate exposure of infants during breastfeeding. Because
there have been to our knowledge no studies published in peer-
reviewed journals reporting glyphosate concentrations in hu-
man milk, this study (NCT02670278) was undertaken primarily
to document typical glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in
milk produced by lactating women living in the US Pacific
Northwest—a highly productive agricultural region in which
glyphosate-containing herbicides are routinely used (27). Ma-
ternal urine samples were also collected and analyzed. We
hypothesized that concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA in
milk and urine would be low, if even detectable. Important to
testing this hypothesis was the use of newly optimized, matrix-
specific assays with high sensitivities and specificities for the
analytes (28).
METHODS
Human subjects
All procedures used in this study were approved by the
Washington State University Institutional Review Board, and
informed consent was obtained from each subject. A total of 41
healthy lactating women living in and around Pullman, Wash-
ington, and Moscow, Idaho, were included in the study, which
was part of a larger investigation of international variation in
human milk oligosaccharides and bacterial taxa as they relate to
environmental exposure and sociocultural practices. To be eli-
gible for participation, women had to be 1–3 mo postpartum,
breastfeeding and/or pumping milk $5 times/d, and aged $18 y.
Because we wanted to limit our subjects to healthy women who
were nursing healthy infants, exclusion criteria included current
breast infection, use of antibiotics in the previous 30 d, and
having an infant with signs or symptoms of illness in the pre-
vious 7 d. Subjects completed a brief survey to document basic
health and demographic variables, and body weight and height
were measured at enrollment, which spanned from May 2014
through March 2015. All but 1 subject also completed
a 5-question survey documenting potential glyphosate exposure
from the environment and diet (Supplemental Figure 1).
Milk and urine collection and preservation
Milk and urine were collected between 0700 and 1100. After
cleaning the breast (a step necessary to meet the needs of the
larger, overarching project), w30 mL milk was collected with
the use of a Medela Symphony hospital-grade electric breast pump
into a Medela Symphony single-use sterile collection container,
immediately placed in ice, separated into aliquots while fresh,
and then frozen at 2208C until analysis. A midstream urine
sample was collected into a single-use sterile collection con-
tainer. The sample container was immediately placed in ice, and
urine was separated into aliquots and frozen at 2208C until
analysis. One subject failed to provide a urine sample.
Glyphosate and AMPA analyses
Milk and urine samples were analyzed for glyphosate and
AMPA at Monsanto with the use of liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry methods optimized for and validated in each
sample matrix (28). A Shimadzu Prominence 20A HPLC system
coupled to an AB Sciex API 5500 triple-quadrupole mass
spectrometer was used for analysis. Glyphosate and AMPA were
quantitated with the use of multiple reaction monitoring. Two
precursor-product ion transitions for each analyte and stable
isotope labeled internal standard for each analyte were used to
ensure the selectivity of the methods. Although 2 quantitative
precursor-product ion transitions were monitored, the results
were reported with the use of the most sensitive transition for
each analyte. The assay was validated separately for milk and
urine. Limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs)
for glyphosate in milk were 1.0 and 10.0 mg/L, respectively;
those for urine were 0.02 and 0.10 mg/L, respectively. LODs and
LOQs for AMPA in milk were 1.0 and 10.0 mg/L, respectively;
those for urine were 0.03 and 0.10 mg/L, respectively.
Glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in milk were indepen-
dently confirmed by Covance with the use of the same liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry method (28) with
minor modifications, which included the use of an AB Sciex
QTrap 5500 triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer. Because of
differences in instrumentation, the LODs that used the more
sensitive quantitative ion transitions were 6.0 and 9.0 mg/L for
human milk glyphosate and AMPA, respectively, and the LOQ
was 25.0 mg/L for both analytes.
It is noteworthy that duplicate aliquots (created from fresh
milk at the time of collection) of each milk sample were sent
directly, albeit separately, from Washington State University to
Monsanto and Covance. Data generated by Covance were
communicated directly to the principal investigators without
prior disclosure to other coauthors.
Statistical analyses
All values for milk (n = 41) glyphosate and AMPA concen-
trations were below the LOD; thus, no statistical analyses on
these data were warranted. For urine glyphosate and AMPA (n =
40), statistical analyses were conducted with the use of a gen-
eralized linear mixed model (SAS version 9.4; SAS Institute)
assuming a Poisson distribution with a logarithmic link function.
For concentrations less than the respective LOD values, one-half
LOD (0.01 and 0.015 mg/L for glyphosate and AMPA, re-
spectively) nominal values were used in the analyses. For

 concentrations that fell between the LOD and LOQ, one-half
LOQ (0.05 mg/L for both glyphosate and AMPA) nominal
values were used in the analysis (29). All values presented
represent means 6 SDs.
RESULTS
Description of study population and glyphosate exposure
Basic demographic and anthropometric variables for the 41
study subjects are given in Table 1. Women were aged 29 6 5 y,
67 6 17 d postpartum, and had a BMI (kg/m2) of 26.8 6 8.6.
Most (75%) lived in an urban or suburban nonfarming region of
the Palouse (a geographical area encompassing southeastern
Washington and northwestern Idaho), and most (58%) reported
that they made no effort to eat foods characterized as organic,
although they sometimes included them in their diets for con-
venience. Few subjects (15%) reported ever having personally
mixed or used any type of weed killer; all but 1 of the women
having reported ever doing so had mixed or used a weed killer
containing glyphosate. In general, subjects were highly educated
Caucasian women who participated in the study during either
the summer or winter months.
Glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in milk
A summary of our findings concerning milk glyphosate and
AMPA are found in Table 2. Regardless of whether the assays
were conducted at Monsanto or Covance, none of the milk
samples contained detectable amounts of either glyphosate or
AMPA. As such, descriptive and statistical analyses were not
warranted.
Glyphosate and AMPA concentrations in urine
A summary of our findings concerning urine glyphosate and
AMPA are found in Table 2 (raw data are available in Supple-
mental Table 1). Glyphosate was detectable in nearly all (n =
37) of the urine samples and was quantifiable in 29 of them.
Glyphosate values ranged from below the LOD (,0.02 mg/L) to
1.93 mg/L, with a mean of 0.28 6 0.38 mg/L. AMPA was also
detectable in nearly all (n = 38) of the urine samples and
quantifiable in 29 of them. Urine AMPA values ranged from
below the LOD (,0.03 mg/L) to 1.33 mg/L, with a mean of
0.30 6 0.33 mg/L. There were no significant effects of consuming
organic compared with conventional foods or living on/near
a farm compared with living in an urban/suburban region on
concentrations of glyphosate in urine (P = 0.1870 and 0.8773,
respectively) (Figure 1). Neither were there significant effects
of consuming organic compared with conventional foods or
living on/near a farm compared with living in an urban/suburban
region on concentrations of AMPA in urine (P = 0.1414 and
0.2525, respectively) (Figure 2).
Adjusting for potential co-
variates (age, time postpartum, BMI, parity) did not alter these
conclusions. When raw, untransformed values were used in the
analysis, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.57; P # 0.0001)
between urinary glyphosate and AMPA concentrations. The
strength of this association increased when log-transformed data
were used (r = 0.68; P # 0.0001) (Figure 3).
DISCUSSION
The results herein provide evidence that the concentrations of
glyphosate and AMPA in milk produced by healthy women are
below the detection limits of available validated assays. In urine,
glyphosate and AMPA were detectable in many samples, but
concentrations were very low (,0.02 to 1.93 and ,0.03 to 1.33
mg/L, respectively)—in fact, well below values reported in other

NO DETECTABLE GLYPHOSATE OR AMPA IN HUMAN MILK

 healthy adult populations (,0.15 to 29 and ,0.15 to 1.82 mg/L,
respectively) (14, 24–26). To put these values in perspective, it is
worth considering the EPA’s reference dose (RfD) value for
glyphosate. The RfD is an estimate of the quantity of a chemical
that a person could be exposed to every day for the rest of his or
her life with no appreciable risk of adverse health effects (30).
The RfD for glyphosate is 1.75 g $ kg21 $ d21; this value is
based on a “no-effect” concentration in animals (175 mg $ kg21 $ d21)
with a 100-fold safety factor (margin of exposure) (31). The
EPA considers AMPA to be of similar or lesser toxicity than
glyphosate and determined in 1994 that it should be exempt
from regulation regardless of concentrations observed in food or
feed (31). Thus, a 75-kg woman (typical weight for our study’s
participants) could consume as much as 131.25 mg glyphosate/
d with no expected negative effects. If 20% of dietary glyph-
osate is absorbed (i.e., 20% bioavailability) (14) and 100% of
absorbed glyphosate is excreted into urine, such an individual
would be expected to excrete 26.25 mg/d (26,250 mg/d)
glyphosate in her urine. In the current study, the highest reported
urine glyphosate concentration was 1.93 mg/L. As such, even
allowing for a relatively high urine output (3 L/d), the highest
glyphosate excretion in our study would be 5.79 mg/d, a value
.4500 times lower than that which would be expected if the
hypothetical mother described previously had consumed the
RfD for glyphosate. The inclusion of AMPA, assuming equiv-
alent toxicity, results in the highest excretion in our study of 2.58
mg/L (7.74 mg/d assuming 3 L urine/d) glyphosate + AMPA, an
exposure .3000 times below the RfD; this combined calcula-
tion may become important if the EPA reconsiders the safety of
AMPA (31).
Applying similar parameters and logic, a 5-kg infant can
consume up to 8.5 mg/d (8500 mg/d) glyphosate and be below
the RfD of this compound. Assuming a mean milk intake of 0.7
L/d (32–34) and a milk glyphosate concentration of 1 mg/L (the
LOD value), then the maximum daily consumption of glyph-
osate by this hypothetical infant would be 0.7 mg/d—a value
,12,000 times that which is thought to signal any semblance of
a health concern (31).

 The observed correlation between urine glyphosate and AMPA
concentrations is also of interest. Our reanalysis of previously
published data from Hoppe et al. (20) suggests correlations
(Pearson correlations of 0.40 and 0.68 for raw and log-transformed
data, respectively) very similar to our data. Because the strength
of association was greater with the use of the log-transformed
data, it is likely that this relation is not proportional but rather
nonlinear in nature. Whether the AMPA was derived from en-
dogenous metabolism of glyphosate, consumed as a component
of the diet, or resulted from exposure to AMPA-containing
detergents, however, cannot be determined from our study.
There are some limitations that should be taken into consid-
eration when interpreting the results of this study. First, our
subjects were relatively homogeneous in terms of anthropo-
metrics, demographics, and geographical place of residence.
Future studies should consider recruiting women of varied ed-
ucational and ethnic backgrounds living in different regions of the
United States. Second, it is noteworthy that the larger in-
ternational study from which these samples originate was not
designed to detect small differences in urine glyphosate and
AMPA concentrations based on dietary choices, location of
residence (e.g., urban compared with rural), or occupational
glyphosate exposure. Nevertheless, we thought it was of topical
interest to preliminarily explore those hypotheses given the
availability of information. We note, however, that detecting such
small-effect sizes at statistically significant concentrations and
adequate statistical power would require 4–5 times as many
observations than used in this study. Subsequent research on this
topic should consider increasing sample sizes to the largest
extent possible while targeting enrollment of women who fit the
hypotheses of interest, such as rarely or commonly consuming
organic food, living on or off farms where glyphosate is used,
and/or mixing and applying glyphosate as part of their liveli-
hood. Studies might also consider investigating the possible
effect of agricultural season on the outcomes of interest and the
potential for breast infection (mastitis) to influence whether
glyphosate and AMPA can be detected in a woman’s milk. In-
vestigators are also urged to collect urine samples from exclu-
sively breastfed infants to verify the lack of glyphosate and
AMPA exposure during this important period of the life cycle
and consider collecting complete breast expressions in case
glyphosate and AMPA concentrations change during feeding.
Last, studying potential glyphosate and AMPA exposures from
other sources (e.g., environmental and supplementary foods)
before and after weaning might be of interest. However, it is
important to note that glyphosate exposure would need to be
much higher than those reported herein for maternal or infant
exposures to become a health concern.
The authors’ responsibilities were as follows—MKM, MAM, DAG, and JLV:
conceptualized and designed the study; MKM and DAG: designed the glyph-
osate exposure questionnaire; MKM: oversaw sample and data collection; JMC
and KAL: collected the samples and administered the questionnaires; PKJ: over-
saw the analysis of the samples at Monsanto; WJP and BS: carried out the
statistical analysis; and all authors: read and approved the final manuscript. In
2014, MKM and MAM each received a $10,000 unrestricted research gift from
Monsanto; these funds were used to support their research related to human and
bovine lactation. These funds were neither needed for nor used to cover the costs
associated with the project described in this article, because the milk was already
being collected for another project funded by the National Science Foundation
(1344288) related to international variation in human milk composition and
because additional expenditures associated with the collection of urine samples
were negligible. All costs associated with the chemical analysis of milk and urine
samples at both Monsanto and Covance were paid for directly by Monsanto.
MKM and MAM were once reimbursed for costs associated with economy travel
and basic accommodations incurred for a trip they made to St. Louis, Missouri,
to discuss study design and assay development with coauthors DAG, PKJ, and
JLV at Monsanto. DAG, PKJ, and JLV are employees of Monsanto, which
manufactures glyphosate. None of the other authors reported a conflict of interest
related to the study.
