U
nder physiological conditions, the arterial vasculature is 
characterized by a progressive increase in stiffness from 
the aorta and large elastic arteries toward the peripheral muscu-
lar conduit arteries, often labeled as the arterial stiffness gradi-
ent.1,2 However, this gradient is not by any means invariable as 
stiffness of the aorta tends to increase with age, whereas the 
relationship between peripheral muscular arteries and advanc-
ing age is not as pronounced.1,3–5 In fact, upper-limb muscular 
artery compliance may even decrease with age in women and 
in individuals with diabetes mellitus.6,7 Age-related changes 
in vasculature thereby result in a reduction, or even a rever-
sal of the physiological arterial stiffness gradient in most 
individuals.1,5
Increased aortic stiffness, most commonly measured as 
the carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity (CFPWV), is a strong 
predictor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) both in patient and 
population-based cohorts.8–11 In contrast, it is unclear whether 
muscular conduit artery stiffness, often measured in the arm 
as the carotid–radial pulse wave velocity (CRPWV), is asso-
ciated with cardiovascular morbidity.2,12–14 Although CRPWV 
has been largely overshadowed in research and clinical prac-
tice by CFPWV because of its limited prognostic value, recent 
research suggests that CRPWV may, after all, also have an 
important role in CVD risk prediction. Specifically, a recent 
study by Fortier et al14 reported that an increased aortic–bra-
chial arterial stiffness gradient (defined as the ratio of CFPWV 
and CRPWV) was a better predictor of all-cause mortality 
than CFPWV per se.
Fortier et al14 and Covic and Siriopol15 of an accompanying 
editorial speculated that the finding of a clinically significant 
Abstract—A recent study reported that the aortic–brachial arterial stiffness gradient, defined as carotid–radial/carotid–
femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV ratio), predicts all-cause mortality better than carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity 
(CFPWV) alone in dialysis patients. However, the prognostic significance of PWV ratio for cardiovascular disease (CVD) 
in the community remains unclear. Accordingly, we assessed the correlates and prognostic value of the PWV ratio in 2114 
Framingham Heart Study participants (60±10 years; 56% women) free of overt CVD. Mean PWV ratio decreased from 
1.36±0.19 in participants aged <40 years to 0.73±0.21 in those aged ≥80 years. In multivariable linear regression, older 
age, male sex, higher body mass index, diabetes mellitus, lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, higher mean arterial 
pressure, and higher heart rate were associated with lower PWV ratio (P<0.001 for all). During a median follow-up 
of 12.6 years, 248 first CVD events occurred. In Cox regression models adjusted for standard CVD risk factors, 1-SD 
changes in CFPWV (hazard ratio, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–1.61) and PWV ratio (hazard ratio, 1.32; 95% 
confidence interval, 1.09–1.59) were associated with similar CVD risks. Models that included conventional CVD risk 
factors plus CFPWV or PWV ratio gave the same C statistics (C=0.783). Although PWV ratio has been reported to provide 
incremental predictive value over CFPWV in dialysis patients, we could not replicate these findings in our community-
based sample. Our findings suggest that the prognostic significance of PWV ratio may vary based on baseline CVD risk, 
and CFPWV should remain the criterion standard for assessing vascular stiffness in the community.  (Hypertension.

interaction between elastic and muscular arteries could open 
a new area for future research, and both agreed that the role 
of the arterial stiffness gradient as a cardiovascular risk factor 
needs validation in the community. Therefore, we evaluated 
whether the aortic–brachial arterial stiffness gradient incre-
mentally predicts CVD beyond conventional CFPWV in com-
munity-dwelling participants in the Framingham Heart Study 
Offspring cohort.
Methods
Participants
The Framingham Heart Study Offspring cohort consists of the chil-
dren of individuals in the Original Framingham cohort, along with 
their spouses.16 The baseline characteristics and more detailed study 
protocol for the Framingham Offspring cohort have been previously 
published.16 We included participants who attended the seventh 
examination cycle of the Framingham Offspring cohort (n=3539; 
1998–2001) in the present investigation. Because of a delayed start, 
tonometry measurements were implemented in 2660 of 3539 par-
ticipants during the study cycle beginning in February 1999. We 
excluded participants who had incomplete tonometry data (n=372) 
or prevalent CVD (n=174) from the present analysis resulting in a 
final study sample of 2114 participants. The study was conducted 
according to the Declaration of Helsinki. All study protocols were 
reviewed and approved by Boston University Medical Center’s 
Institutional Review Board, and participants provided written 
informed consent.
Clinical Evaluation and Definitions
The participants provided medical history and underwent physical 
examination and assessment of CVD risk factors.16 The participants 
were using their normal CVD medications at the time of PWV mea-
surements. We assessed participants for self-reported cigarette use in 
the year preceding the examination and diabetes mellitus (fasting glu-
cose level of ≥126 mg/dL or the use of hypoglycemic medications). 
In addition, we measured blood pressure (mean of 2 auscultatory 
values measured by a physician with a mercury column sphygmoma-
nometer on seated participants using a standardized protocol), body 
mass index (BMI), serum total cholesterol levels, and high-density 
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. Sitting blood pressure 
was measured ≈30 to 180 minutes before tonometry. We derived heart 
rate from a 10-second 12-lead ECG recording.
CFPWV, CRPWV, and PWV Ratio
Arterial tonometry measures with simultaneous ECG recording were 
acquired from the radial, femoral, and carotid arteries after >5 min-
utes of rest in the supine position, as described previously.17,18 All 
recordings were performed on the right side of the body. Transit dis-
tances were estimated by measuring the body surface distance from 
the suprasternal notch to each pulse recording site. CFPWV and 
CRPWV were calculated from tonometry waveforms and body sur-
face measurements, which were adjusted for parallel transmission in 
the brachiocephalic artery and aortic arch with the use of the supra-
sternal notch as a fiducial point. We also derived supine mean arterial 
pressure from integration of the brachial waveform calibrated with 
oscillometric blood pressure at the time of tonometry. We inverted 
CFPWV to reduce heteroscedasticity and multiplied by −1 to restore 
directionality of the association. CRPWV was normally distributed 
and therefore included in the models without transformation. We 
defined the aortic–brachial arterial stiffness gradient as a PWV ratio, 
that is, CRPWV divided by CFPWV. This approach underscores the 
youthful design of the arterial system, that is, arterial stiffness should 
normally increase when moving distally in the arterial system. We 
used the skewed variable as the denominator, which resulted in a nor-
mal distribution for PWV ratio.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was incidence of major CVD disease events, a 
composite end point of cardiovascular death, fatal or nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, unstable angina (prolonged ischemic episode with 
documented reversible ST-segment changes), stroke, and heart failure. 
Medical records were obtained for all hospitalizations and physician 
visits related to CVD disease during follow-up and were reviewed by 
an adjudication panel consisting of 3 investigators. Criteria for these 
CVD events have been described previously.19
Statistical Methods
We used sex- and 5-year age-specific medians as cutoff points to define 
high and low PWV. We assessed baseline characteristics in groups cross-
classified by high/low CFPWV and CRPWV. We chose this approach 
to clarify if any potential relation between PWV ratio and CVD out-
comes is driven by the numerator (CRPWV) versus the denominator 
(CFPWV) of the ratio. In addition, we opted to use age- and sex-spe-
cific cutoffs instead of a single cutoff because of the strong relationship 
between age and CFPWV to avoid categorizing individuals in a higher 
PWV category mainly based on their age. We compared pairwise dif-
ferences in characteristics between the 4 groups using 2 sample t tests 
and χ2 tests. We applied Bonferroni correction on the pairwise compari-
sons to account for multiple testing. We examined correlates of PWV 
ratio using Pearson correlation and linear regression. We included age, 
sex, BMI, diabetes mellitus, smoking, serum total cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, mean arterial pressure (diastolic pressure+1/3×pulse pres-
sure), and heart rate as the predictors. Continuous variables were stan-
dardized for comparability. We also assessed incidence of CVD events 
in groups cross-classified by high versus low CFPWV and CRPWV 
using cumulative incidence plots, log-rank tests, and multivariable-
adjusted Cox models, with low CFPWV/high CRPWV as referent. We 
examined the relation of CFPWV, CRPWV, and PWV ratio as continu-
ous variables with CVD outcomes using multivariable-adjusted Cox 
regression models. We calculated C statistics for the models to assess 
model discrimination.20 We adjusted all multivariable models for age, 
sex, BMI, diabetes mellitus, smoking, serum total cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate. Furthermore, we 
examined the relations of CFPWV, CRPWV, and PWV ratio with CVD 
outcomes in subgroups by sex, age, diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive 
therapy, and CFPWV level. Interactions between the continuous expo-
sure variable and subgroup were tested by entering a product term into 
the models. A 2-sided value of P<0.05 was considered statistically sig-
nificant. All analyses were performed with Stata software version 13.1 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX).
Results
Characteristics for the overall study sample and in subgroups 
cross-classified by high versus low CFPWV and CRPWV are 
reported in Table 1. In general, participants with high CFPWV 
had more adverse CVD risk profiles than those with low 
CFPWV. In turn, after classification by CFPWV, individuals 
with high and low CRPWV had relatively similar CVD risk 
profiles. CFPWV increased, whereas CRPWV remained fairly 
stable with older age (Figure 1). Consequently, PWV ratio 
was 1.36±0.19 in participants aged <40 years to 0.73±0.21 in 
those aged ≥80 years.
The correlation coefficient between CFPWV and CRPWV 
was 0.38 (P<0.001). Univariate and multivariable correlates 
of PWV ratio are reported in Table 2. In univariate analyses, 
all variables were associated with lower PWV ratio, except 
sex and serum total cholesterol. In multivariable linear regres-
sion with all variables included, older age, male sex, higher 
BMI, diabetes mellitus, lower HDL cholesterol, mean arte-
rial pressure, and higher heart rate were associated with lower 
PWV ratio (P<0.001 for all). These variables explained 52% 
of variation in PWV ratio.

During follow-up (median, 12.6 years), 248 first CVD 
events occurred. Figure 2 illustrates the cumulative incidence 
of CVD events in groups cross-classified by high versus low 
CFPWV and CRPWV. The CVD incidence rates and both 
unadjusted and adjusted hazards ratios increased from low 
CFPWV to high CFPWV, whereas further cross-classification 
by CRPWV had only a small effect on the hazard ratios (HRs; 
Table S1 in the online-only Data Supplement). Compared 
with individuals having low CFPWV and high CRPWV, 
multivariable-adjusted risk of CVD events was not signifi-
cantly increased in participants having low CFPWV and low 
CRPWV (HR, 1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–1.87). 
In turn, participants having high CFPWV and high CRPWV 
had a similar risk of CVD events (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.04–
2.47) compared with those having CFPWV and low CRPWV 
(HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.01–2.57).
When the prognostic significance of CFPWV, CRPWV, 
and PWV ratio were assessed as continuous variables, only 
CFPWV (HR, 1.33 per 1-SD increase; 95% CI, 1.10–1.61) 
and PWV ratio (HR, 1.32 per 1-SD decrease; 95% CI, 1.09–
1.59), but not CRPWV (HR, 0.99 per 1-SD increase; 95% CI, 
0.86–1.14) reached statistical significance in multivariable-
adjusted Cox models (Table 3). C statistics of the models that 
included CFPWV or PWV ratio were the same (C=0.783). In a 
sensitivity analysis, we included supine mean arterial pressure 
derived from integration of the brachial waveform calibrated

with blood pressure at the time of tonometry, instead of sit-
ting auscultatory mean arterial pressure, in the models (Table 
S2). This did not materially change the results as the multi-
variable-adjusted HRs for CFPWV, CRPWV, and PWV ratio 
were 1.23 (95% CI, 1.01–1.51), 0.93 (95% CI, 0.81–1.08), 
and 1.27 (95% CI, 1.05–1.54), respectively. C statistics for 
models with CFPWV or PWV ratio were 0.784. We also 
investigated whether the prognostic significance of CFPWV, 
CRPWV, and PWV ratio differed between subgroups by sex, 
age, diabetes mellitus, antihypertensive therapy, and CFPWV 
level (Table 4). In these analyses, CRPWV was not signifi-
cantly associated with CVD outcomes in any subgroup. The 
only significant interaction was observed for CFPWV and age 
(<70 versus ≥70 years). In the subsample of 427 individu-
als aged ≥70 years with 109 incident cardiovascular events, 
the HRs for CVD events per 1-SD increases in CFPWV and 
CRPWV and per 1-SD decrease in PWV ratio were 1.39 (95% 
CI, 1.06–1.82), 0.90 (95% CI, 0.73–1.12), and 1.54 (95% CI, 
1.16–2.04), respectively (Table 4).
Discussion
In our investigation, we demonstrated that the aortic– 
brachial 
arterial stiffness gradient, defined as the ratio between 
CRPWV and CFPWV, is significantly related to cardiovascu-
lar outcomes in the community. However, PWV ratio provides 
no incremental predictive value for CVD events over common 
cardiovascular risk factors and CFPWV. In our lower-risk 
community-dwelling population, we could not replicate the 
previous findings that underscored the prognostic importance 
of the PWV ratio in dialysis patients.14
The aortic–brachial arterial stiffness gradient is a rela-
tively new concept in arterial research.21 The stiffness gradi-
ent hypothesis is based on previous observations, which have 
shown that under normal conditions, when aortic stiffness is 
lower than that of medium-sized muscular conduit arteries,

partial pressure wave reflections are generated at the transi-
tion of these segments, resulting in attenuated pulse pressure 
transmission.17,22–24 However, the aortic–brachial arterial stiff-
ness gradient is reversed with aging in most individuals when 
aortic stiffness increases considerably while peripheral mus-
cular artery stiffness experiences only minor or nonexistent 
increases.1,3–5 This reversal of the stiffness gradient, in turn, 
has been shown to be associated with less distal reflection and 
attenuation of the forward pressure wave when it is transmit-
ted to the microcirculation, potentially leading to increased 
organ damage.14,21 The transmission of excessive forward 
pressure may be especially detrimental for high-flow organs 
such as the brain or the kidney. Indeed, at least 2 studies have 
shown that increased arterial stiffness by itself is associated 
with transmission of increased flow pulsatility into and the 
brain and kidneys, leading to structural brain damage, micro-
albuminuria, and kidney injury.25,26
Although the stiffness gradient hypothesis is an inter-
esting concept, our findings do not support the notion that 
measurement of the aortic–brachial arterial stiffness gradient 
ratio provides additional prognostic value over conventional 
CFPWV in the community, or in subgroups. Our findings 
have no direct implications for the validity of the concept, 
but primarily demonstrate that the loss of stiffness gradi-
ent is essentially all attributable to the increase in CFPWV 
rather than to a decrease in CRPWV. To our knowledge, only 
1 published study has previously investigated the prognos-
tic significance of arm/aorta PWV ratio. In this publication,

 Niiranen et al  Aortic–Brachial Stiffness Gradient and CVD Risk  1027
Fortier et al14 assessed the relation of aortic–brachial arte-
rial stiffness gradient and all-cause mortality in 310 adult 
patients on dialysis. In contrast to our findings, the authors 
found that the unadjusted HR for all-cause mortality related 
to 1-SD increase in PWV ratio was 1.43 (95% CI, 1.24–1.64) 
whereas the HR for a 1-SD increase in CFPWV was 1.29 
(95% CI, 1.11–1.50). PWV ratio resulted in a model C statis-
tic of 0.694, whereas the C statistic for a model that included 
CFPWV was only 0.627. In addition, only PWV ratio, but not 
CFPWV, CRPWV, or augmentation index (a measure of wave 
reflection and arterial stiffness), was significantly associated 
with outcomes after adjustment for other classical cardiovas-
cular risk factors.14 The discrepancy between our findings and 
those of Fortier et al on PWV ratio and CVD outcomes may 
be explained by several factors. First and foremost, our study 
included a community-based sample whereas the study of 
Fortier et al included only dialysis patients, a highly selected 
group of patients with multiple comorbidities, such as hyper-
tension, diabetes mellitus, inflammation, and anemia.27 In the 
long term, these patients undergo significant arterial remod-
eling that is already observed in early-stage chronic kidney 
disease.28 And in the short term, both fluid overload and 
hemodialysis have been shown to have drastic effects on arte-
rial stiffness.29,30 Another possible cause for the inconsistent 
results is that the stiffness gradient hypothesis may oversim-
plify the interaction between the aorta and muscular conduit 
arteries. The vascular system does not solely consist of 2 
tubes attached to each other. Furthermore, previous results 
have been somewhat mixed even among dialysis patients 
as in a study by Pannier et al,2 only aortic stiffness, but not 
peripheral muscular artery stiffness, predicted cardiovascular 
mortality. In summary, our observations do not support the 
use of PWV ratio for CVD risk assessment in the community. 
We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that PWV ratio 
might provide incremental predictive value over CFPWV in 
the elderly. In individuals aged ≥70 years, the HRs for CVD 
events per 1-SD increase in CFPWV and per 1-SD decrease 
in PWV ratio were 1.39 and 1.54, but with widely overlap-
ping CIs. Given these findings, additional larger studies of 
older individuals are warranted to better assess the predictive 
value of the PWV ratio in the elderly.
We observed that higher age, male sex, higher BMI, dia-
betes mellitus, lower HDL cholesterol, higher mean arterial 
pressure, and higher heart rate were associated with lower 
PWV ratio. In the study by Fortier et al,14 only higher age, dia-
betes mellitus, history of CVD, and lower hemoglobin were 
related to PWV ratio in a multivariable regression analysis. 
However, the findings of Fortier et al14 were limited by their 
smaller study sample and lack of some relevant clinical vari-
ables. However, all of these factors have also been found to 
be correlates of CFPWV, the apparent main driver of PWV 
ratio.17,31 We could not therefore find any correlates that are 
specific to PWV ratio.
Our study has several strengths that merit comment. For 
example, our study was performed with a moderately-sized 
population sample of community-dwelling individuals, which 
enhanced generalizability and made subgroup analyses fea-
sible. In addition, in contrast to the only previous prognostic 
study, data were available on CVD outcomes and all relevant 
cardiovascular risk factors.14 Our study also has certain limi-
tations, such as a study sample consisting mainly of middle-
aged to older adults of European descent. The extent to which 
our results are generalizable to other racial or ethnic groups, 
or to elderly individuals with multiple comorbidities, remains 
unknown, and warrants further study. In addition, the num-
ber of CVD events in some of the groups cross-classified 
by high/low CFPWV and CRPWV was relatively modest. 
Nevertheless, the findings from these analyses were consistent 
with those that modeled PWV ratio as a continuous variable. 
Furthermore, we cannot exclude residual confounding.
Perspectives
Our results confirm that CFPWV and PWV ratio are associ-
ated with CVD events. Although a recent previous study had 
reported that PWV ratio might provide incremental predictive 
value over CFPWV in dialysis patients, we could not validate 
these findings in a community setting.14 In fact, nearly all of 
the prognostic significance of PWV ratio in the general popu-
lation seems to be driven by CFPWV. Based on our results, 
CFPWV should remain the criterion standard for assessing 
vascular stiffness in the community.32

What Is New?
• A recent study reported that the aortic-brachial arterial stiffness gradient, 
defined as the ratio of carotid–radial and carotid–femoral pulse wave 
velocity, is a better predictor of all-cause mortality than carotid–femoral 
pulse wave velocity in dialysis patients.
• The role of the arterial stiffness gradient as a cardiovascular risk factor 
has not been validated in the community.
What Is Relevant?
• The arterial stiffness gradient provided no incremental predictive value 
for cardiovascular events over common cardiovascular risk factors and 
carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity in a lower-risk community-dwelling 
population.
Summary
Carotid–femoral pulse wave velocity should remain the criterion 
standard for assessing vascular stiffness in the community.
