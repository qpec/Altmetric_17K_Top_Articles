Introduction
The human brain can construct an almost unlimited number of
conceptual combinations from a finite set of constituents (e.g.,
creating “soft plaid jacket” from the constituents “soft, “plaid,”
and “jacket”). The cognitive aspects of semantic composition
have been debated for hundreds of years in philosophy, linguis-
tics, and psychology (Hume, 1739/1978; Wernicke, 1874; De-
jerine, 1892; Wittgenstein, 1953; Geschwind, 1965; Fodor, 1975;
Murphy, 2002), and in recent decades neuroscientists have begun
to develop models for how the brain might perform these com-
binatorial processes in semantic memory.
Many models of semantic memory include the idea of “hubs”
or “convergence zones” for semantic information. These hubs are

Significance Statement
A major goal of neuroscience is to understand the neural basis of behaviors that are fundamental to human intelligence. One
essential behavior is the ability to integrate conceptual knowledge from semantic memory, allowing us to construct an almost
unlimited number of complex concepts from a limited set of basic constituents (e.g., “leaf” and “wet” can be combined into the
more complex representation “wet leaf”). Here, we present a novel approach to studying integrative processes in semantic
memory by applying focal brain stimulation to a heteromodal cortical hub implicated in semantic processing. Our findings
demonstrate a causal role of the left angular gyrus in lexical-semantic integration and provide motivation for novel therapeutic
applications in patients with lexical-semantic deficits.

 proposed to have two key features: (1) they are amodal or multi-
modal in nature, because they represent information across mul-
tiple sensory modalities (e.g., auditory and visual knowledge);
and (2) they are integrative, in that they store high-level informa-
tion about the associations between features of concepts. Al-
though recent work has begun to characterize the amodal nature
of semantic hubs (Devereux et al., 2013; Fairhall and Caramazza,
2013), few studies have directly tested their integrative functions
in semantic memory or provided causal evidence for how the
brain carries out these integrative processes.
Findings from fMRI and MEG have suggested that one poten-
tial hub for semantic-memory integration is the angular gyrus
(AG; Vigneau et al., 2006; Binder et al., 2009; Graves et al., 2010;
Bemis and Pylkka
¨nen, 2013; Price et al., 2015b). Indeed, the an-
atomic properties of this region are indicative of high-level mul-
timodal processing. The AG is a heteromodal brain region in the
inferior parietal lobe with reciprocal white-matter connections to
sensorimotor cortices, as well as classic language regions in the
inferior frontal and superior temporal gyri (Caspers et al., 2011).
Heteromodal cortices like the AG also have larger and more com-
plex dendritic fields relative to unimodal cortices, suggestive of
diverse and highly integrative computations (Elston et al., 2001;
Jacobs et al., 2001).
In this study, we directly tested the integrative role of the left
AG in semantic memory by applying high-definition transcranial
direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS; Datta et al., 2009) in
healthy adults to modulate neural activity and determine its ef-
fects on semantic integration. HD-tDCS is a recent innovation in
brain-stimulation technology that allows for the application of
relatively focal current stimulation by using a circumscribed ar-
ray of scalp electrodes. The multielectrode array allows for ana-
tomic specificity that is not possible with traditional tDCS (Datta
et al., 2009; Caparelli-Daquer et al., 2012; Kuo et al., 2013). Pre-
liminary evidence suggests that the effects from HD-tDCS may be
larger and longer lasting than conventional tDCS (Kuo et al.,
2013).
Here, we applied anodal HD-tDCS to our brain regions of
interest. Anodal stimulation is associated with cortical excitabil-
ity (Nitsche and Paulus, 2000, 2001; Antal et al., 2004) through
incremental depolarization of the resting membrane potential
and increased neural firing rates (Bindman et al., 1964; Purpura
and McMurtry, 1965). tDCS has been widely used to better un-
derstand causal brain-behavior relationships in many cognitive
domains (Nitsche et al., 2003; Flo
¨el et al., 2008; Cohen Kadosh et
al., 2010; Turkeltaub et al., 2012; Ruff et al., 2013; Filmer et al.,
2014; Reinhart and Woodman, 2015), and recent work has
shown reliable effects of left-hemisphere anodal tDCS on lan-
guage performance (Price et al., 2015a).
To examine causal relationships between the AG and lexical-
semantic integration, we administered HD-tDCS while partici-
pants performed a two-word comprehension task. Participants
underwent three separate brain-stimulation sessions: left AG,
right AG, and sham stimulation. We also administered a letter-
string task to test for more general effects on attention and visual
processing. Like many language functions, lexical-semantic pro-
cessing appears to be relatively left lateralized in right-handed
participants (Binder et al., 2009; Price et al., 2015b). Thus, we
hypothesized that anodal stimulation to the left AG would selec-
tively modulate integrative processes in semantic memory, re-
sulting in faster reaction times for the comprehension of
meaningful adjective–noun combinations.
Materials and Methods
Participants
A total of 18 healthy adults from the University of Pennsylvania commu-
nity participated in the study (9 female, mean age � 25.3 years, age range
20–39 years). In a within-subjects design, each participant completed
three separate brain-stimulation sessions, for a total of 54 sessions. All
participants were native English speakers, right-handed (as assessed by
the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory), and had normal or corrected-to-
normal vision. Participants had no history of neurological difficultly or
preconditions (e.g., epileptic seizures, brain injuries, implants), or psy-
chiatric illness, as determined by a pre-experiment screening. We ob-
tained informed consent from all participants according to a protocol
approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board.
Experimental procedure
The experimental instructions were identical for all sessions. In a
within-subjects design, participants received the three separate brain-
stimulation conditions with their order counterbalanced across par-
ticipants: (1) a left AG anodal stimulation condition, (2) a right AG
anodal stimulation condition, (3) a sham stimulation condition (for
the placement of electrodes, see HD-tDCS application). The sessions
were scheduled at the same time of day for each participant and were
a minimum of 48 h apart to avoid potential carryover effects from
stimulation.
HD-tDCS application
Current delivery. The current was generated by a NeuroConn DC Stim-
ulator Plus channeled through a 4 � 1 multichannel stimulation device
(Soterix Medical). For the active anodal brain-stimulation sessions, a
constant current of 2.0 mA was delivered for a period of 20 min, preceded
and followed by linear ramp-up and ramp-down periods of 30 s to min-
imize mild discomfort felt during the beginning and end of stimulation.
For the sham stimulation session, a constant current of 2.0 mA was
delivered for a period of 30 s preceded and followed by the same linear
ramp-up and ramp-down periods of 30 s (to induce the initial tingling
sensations of current flow felt in the active stimulation conditions), and
then followed by 19.5 min of no stimulation. Thus, the stimulation pro-
tocol for each session lasted 21 min. Experimental tasks were collected
after the end of stimulation. Since the effects of HD-tDCS have been
shown to last for up to 2 h poststimulation (Kuo et al., 2013), this pro-
tocol allowed us to conduct behavioral testing after stimulation but yet
still during the period of neural alteration.
HD-tDCS 4 � 1 ring design. The HD-tDCS ring design has been shown
to replicate classic findings from conventional tDCS, using a 1 � 1 saline-
soaked sponge electrode montage, while producing better spatial focality
and a potentially longer lasting aftereffect than conventional tDCS (Datta
et al., 2009; Caparelli-Daquer et al., 2012; Kuo et al., 2013). Although
HD-tDCS is associated with stronger scalp sensations than conventional
tDCS, it has been shown to be safe and tolerable with applications of up
to 2.0 mA for 20 min (Minhas et al., 2010; Borckardt et al., 2012; Kuo et
al., 2013).
Five sintered Ag/AgCl ring electrodes (outer diameter: 12 mm, inner
diameter: 6 mm; Stens Biofeedback) were used for the 4 � 1 ring design.
One anode was placed directly over the stimulation site, and surrounded
by four equally spaced cathodes at a radius of �6 cm from the anode (Fig.
1B). The five electrodes were connected to the 4-to-1 wire adaptor for the
DC stimulator (NeuroConn DC Stimulator Plus), a battery-driven stim-
ulator that generated the direct current. This 4 � 1 design allows for focal
delivery of anodal current to the targeted brain region using a constant
current of 2.0 mA while applying weaker cathodal current because it is
split by a factor of four. The electrodes were stabilized by plastic electrode
holders (customized from Soterix Medical; radius �1 cm) in a fitted cap
(EASYCAP). The holders were filled with SignaGel, creating a gel contact
of 3.1 cm 2 per electrode. We tailored the stimulation montages to target
our brain regions of interest by generating theoretical models of current
flow using the HD-Explore software (Soterix Medical), which uses a
finite-element-method modeling approach to quantify electric field in-
tensity throughout the brain (Fig. 1C; Datta et al., 2009; Dmochowski et
al., 2011; Kempe et al., 2014). The locations of the electrodes were chosen

 by selecting the 10–20 EEG sites that would optimally target a region in
the left AG identified in a previous fMRI study, which used a similar task
to examine combinatorial semantics in healthy adults (Fig. 1A; Price et
al., 2015b). The peak coordinates from this study were as follows: �52,
�56, 22 (MNI coordinates), which served as the target for our left AG
montage. We also targeted the corresponding contralateral coordinates
for our right AG montage: 52, �56, 22 (MNI coordinates). The peak
coordinates for the left AG come from a whole-brain random-effects t
test of meaningful minus non-meaningful word pairs. Thus, this corre-
sponds to the region showing the most consistently strong effect across
subjects. Anatomically, this peak falls within PGa, a subregion of the AG,
as defined by cytoarchitectonic parcellation (Caspers et al., 2006, 2008).
For the left AG session, this resulted in selecting the central anode as CP5
in the 10–20 EEG coordinate system, and surrounding it by four cathode
electrodes at C3, T7, P7, and P3 (each a distance of �6 cm from the
central electrode). For the right AG session, a mirror coordinate montage
was designed such that the central anodal electrode was placed at CP6 in
the 10–20 EEG coordinate system and surrounded by four cathodal re-
turn electrodes at C4, T8, P8, and P4. For the sham condition, we coun-
terbalanced whether we placed the electrodes in the left or right AG
configuration.
Materials
Stimuli for the word-pair task. Aspects of the stimulus design for the
word-pair task were adapted from a previous study, which showed that
activity in the left AG was modulated by the degree to which a word pair
formed a meaningful conceptual combination (Price et al., 2015b). For
the current study, a larger number of stimuli were developed to create
three different stimulus sets that would allow us to test behavior across
three separate brain stimulation sessions. There were no word repetitions
across the stimulus sets, which allowed us to avoid confounds of famil-
iarity and repetition effects across testing sessions. Using a similar ap-
proach to stimulus design as in Price et al. (2015b), the word pairs for this
study were designed to systematically vary in how readily the two words
were integrated into a semantically coherent combination (as deter-
mined by a series of norming studies, described below). The word pairs
consisted of those that readily combined to form semantically coherent
combinations (e.g., “tiny radish”, “plaid jacket”), which we refer to as
meaningful combinations, and word pairs that did not readily combine
to form semantically coherent combinations (e.g., “fast blueberry”,
“stretchy frost”), which were minimally meaningful combinations, illus-
trated in Figure 2A. For simplicity, we refer to these minimally meaningful
combinations as non-meaningful throughout the text. All word pairs, both
meaningful and non-meaningful, were adjective–noun word pairs.
To develop the stimuli, we created a corpus of over 400 word pairs and
collected norming data that included reaction time, plausibility ratings,
orthographic neighborhood density (Medler and Binder, 2005), syllable
number, letter length, average log lexical frequency from the Subtlexus
database (Brysbaert and New, 2009), average log single word frequency
from Google, and log co-occurrence word frequency from Google.
Google co-occurrence frequency was determined by counting the num-
ber of times the two words occurred together in a particular order within
all web pages ending in “.com” that are indexed on Google (i.e., assessing
unidirectional co-occurrence, such as how frequently the words “plaid
jacket” occur together in sequence, but not counting the reverse sequence
“jacket plaid”). Specifically, we identified the number of search hits for
each word pair and took the log of this value to generate the log co-
occurrence frequency. The process was the same for determining the
single word frequency using Google, except that it was the log of the
number of hits for that individual word instead of the pair of words. In a
separate norming study (n � 24 healthy adults), we collected two sets of
data on all word pairs: a meaningfulness yes/no task, as well as plausibility
ratings of the stimuli using a 1-to-7 scale. In the meaningfulness yes/no
task subjects were asked to decide whether each word pair formed a
meaningful combination or not. Using these yes or no responses, we
retained all word pairs with �85% agreement across subjects, and we
then split the retained stimuli into “meaningful” and “non-meaningful”
categories based on subjects’ responses (i.e., yes � meaningful combina-
tion, no � non-meaningful combination). These word pairs were then
submitted to a stimulus-optimization algorithm implemented in the
MATCH software (Van Casteren and Davis, 2007) to select subsets of
meaningful and non-meaningful word pairs that were best matched on
the large number of psycholinguistic variables described above.
Using MATCH, we selected a total of six sets of stimuli: two categories
(meaningful and non-meaningful word pairs) by three stimulation ses-
sions, creating a total of 210 stimuli used across all three stimulation
sessions (35 meaningful and 35 non-meaningful for each of the 3 ses-
sion). We designed the stimuli so that specific variables were matched
across both sessions and stimulus categories (e.g., single-word fre-
quency), while other variables were matched across sessions but differed
across stimulus categories (e.g., plausibility ratings). Thus each word-
pair category was optimally matched across sessions on reaction time on
the meaningful yes/no norming task (all p values �0.44), plausibility
ratings (all p values �0.41), average word frequency from Subtlexus (all
p values �0.58), average word frequency from Google (all p values
�0.40), co-occurrence word frequency from Google (all p values �0.64),
orthographic neighborhood density (all p values �0.70), letter length (all
p values �0.22), and syllable number (all p values �0.51). The meaning-
ful and non-meaningful word-pair categories were designed to signifi-
cantly differ across sessions on plausibility ratings (all p values �0.001)
and co-occurrence frequency (all p values �0.001). Indeed, there was no

 overlap in average plausibility ratings between
any of the words pairs in the two categories
(i.e., the range of plausibility values for all
meaningful
word
pairs,
was
5.54–7.00,
whereas the range of the plausibility values for
all non-meaningful word pairs was 1.00–2.54).
In addition to being able to divide the
word pairs categorically into meaningful and
non-meaningful word pairs, all three sets of
meaningful words pairs were systematically
designed to include plausibility ratings with
a similar range, distribution, and mean based
on the norming study (set 1 range � 5.54–7,
set 1 mean � 6.63, set 1 SD � 0.35; set 2
range � 5.75–7, set 2 mean � 6.63, set 2
SD � 0.28; set 3 range � 5.67–7, set 3
mean � 6.56, set 3 SD � 0.33). These plau-
sibility ratings were used as a continuous
measure of semantic coherence, which we
used in an item analysis of the stimulation
effects on individual word pairs (described in
the data analysis section below). The pairing of each set of stimuli
with each stimulation condition was then counterbalanced across
participants.
In a separate training task, participants viewed word pairs from a well
controlled published corpus (Graves et al., 2013) containing noun–noun
word pairs that were designed in a similar manner to the adjective–noun
word pairs in this study. We filtered all 2160 word pairs from Graves et al.
(2013) for words used in any of the tasks in our study, such that no word
would be repeated in the subsequent experimental tasks. The same train-
ing set was used in all three stimulation sessions.
Task procedure
The presentation of the stimuli were controlled using E-prime v2 (Psy-
chology Software Tools). The tasks were carefully timed and presented in
the same order across all stimulation sessions. Before the stimulation
protocol started for each session, participants completed practice ver-
sions of the word-pair and letter-string tasks with feedback to ensure that
they understood the tasks. We then administered the stimulation proto-
col. During stimulation, subjects performed the training task using stim-
uli from Graves et al. (2013). This training task began 10 min after the
onset of stimulation to allow for subjects to adjust to the scalp sensations
of HD-tDCS. The training task lasted 6 min. Immediately after the stim-
ulation period ended (i.e., the offset of the stimulation protocol), partic-
ipants began the experimental tasks, which started with the word-pair
task and was then immediately followed by the letter-string task (each
experimental task lasted �5 min). Participants were instructed to indi-
cate their answer as quickly as possible for both the word-pair task and
the letter-string task. For a separate study, participants also completed a
recognition memory task at the end of the experiment, which is not
examined here.
Word-pair task. Participants were instructed to use their right hand for
all tasks and to press one button if the displayed adjective–noun word
pair formed a meaningful combination (e.g., “tiny radish”) and another
button if it did not (e.g., “fast blueberry”). On each trial, a fixation cross
was presented for 500 ms before the onset of the word pair. Subjects read
the word pair and indicated their answer by button press. Their response
ended the trial and moved the subject to the beginning of the fixation
cross of the next trial. Stimulus order was randomized for each partici-
pant. For each session, there were a total of 70 word-pair trials (35 mean-
ingful and 35 non-meaningful combinations), with 10 randomly
distributed null events (3 s in duration). Thus across all three sessions,
there were 210 unique word-pair trials with no word repetitions within
or across sessions.
Letter-string control task. The letter-string task was designed to serve as
a general control task for vision and attention. In this task, non-
pronounceable letter strings were displayed on the screen and partici-
pants were asked to make small visual discriminations between the pairs
of letter strings, illustrated in Figure 2B. Participants were asked to re-
spond using the same button responses as the word-pair task and to
indicate whether or not the letter strings matched (e.g., pnqvt pnqvt) or
not (e.g., vsbsl vsbql). The letter strings were always composed of five
consonants, and non-match letter strings differed by one letter. On each
trial, a fixation cross was presented for 500ms before the onset of the
letter strings. Subjects viewed the letter strings and indicated their answer
by button press. Their response ended the trial and moved the subject to
the beginning of the fixation cross of the next trial. Stimulus order was
randomized for each participant. For each session, there were a total of 70
letter-string trials (half of them matched and half did not) and 10 random
null events (3 s in duration). As with the word-pair task, there were never
any repetitions of stimuli within or between sessions, and the stimulus
sets were counterbalanced across participants. Thus across all three ses-
sions, there were 210 unique letter-string trials.
Scalp sensation and discrimination of sham in HD-tDCS. At the end of
each session, participants evaluated their sense of discomfort during the
session by using a visual analog scale (ranging from 0 to 10) for the
sensations of tingling and burning. After the participant had completed
all three sessions of the study, they were asked to guess whether they
thought that they had received sham or real stimulation in each session.
Data analysis
Random-effects analyses on the categories of word pairs and letter-string
pairs. For each participant, we analyzed the mean reaction time and mean
accuracy for each category in the word-pair task and letter-string task,
summarized in Table 1. For the reaction time analyses, we had specific
hypotheses about the changes in reaction time across sessions for each
task. We hypothesized that there would be a larger combinatorial pro-
cessing advantage in the left AG session relative to the sham and the right
AG sessions. To examine this specific combinatorial processing change,
we used a difference score between our meaningful and non-meaning-
ful word-pair categories [e.g., meaningful reaction time (RT) � non-
meaningful RT], which is robust to overall performance differences
across testing days and which provides a specific test for differential
effects related to the semantic coherence of the word-pair combinations.
We performed paired-sample t tests for the planned comparisons of
reaction time difference scores between stimulation conditions. The
same analysis was conducted for the letter-string task (e.g., matching
letter strings RT minus non-matching letter strings RT). Because we had
hypothesized directions of effects for these comparisons, these t tests
were one-tailed.
We next examined an alternative analysis to the difference score. Be-
cause the sham stimulation condition can be thought of as a baseline
condition, we also examined stimulation effects as a function of the
percentage change relative to sham stimulation for each of the real stim-
ulation conditions. Specifically, for each subject we calculated the per-
centage change in reaction time for real stimulation (i.e., left and right
AG stimulation) relative to sham stimulation for the meaningful and
non-meaningful word-pair categories separately. For example, the per-

Behavioral tasks and example stimuli. A, In the word-pair task, participants viewed two real words whose
combination was considered to be either meaningful (e.g., tiny radish) or non-meaningful (e.g., fast blueberry), as
determined by the results of a norming study. On each trial, participants were asked to decide whether the word pair
formed a meaningful combination or not. B, In the letter-string control task, participants viewed two letter strings that
were either the same letter strings (e.g., pnqvt pnqvt) or differed by one letter (e.g., vsbsl vsbql). On each trial, participants
were asked to decide whether the letter strings matched or not.

Price et al. • Modulating Integrative Semantic Processing
 centage change of the meaningful category in the left AG session was
calculated in the following way: (RTL � RTS)/RTS, where RTL is reaction
time for the meaningful category in the left AG session and RTS is reac-
tion time for the meaningful category in the sham session.
One participant reported at the end of his last session that he had
little-to-no sleep the night before and felt sleepy during testing. We
performed an outlier analysis to determine whether the data for this
participant or any other participant were unusual and potentially dispro-
portionately affecting the reaction time results. For each participant, we
calculated their variation coefficient (i.e., an inverse signal-to-noise ra-
tio) by taking the SD in reaction time across sessions and dividing it by
the mean reaction time. This score provides a measure of how variable a
participant’s performance is across testing sessions, with higher values
indicating greater variability. The participant who reported feeling sleepy
had a variation coefficient that was �3.5 SD away from the mean across
participants. The variation coefficients of all other participants were �1
SD away from the mean. We therefore removed this outlier participant
from the analyses. However, we note that including this participant does
not affect the significance of any of the statistical analyses reported in this
study because this person showed an effect in the hypothesized direction
for each of the analyses (all p values � 0.05 for any significant comparison
reported in the results section; all non-significant comparisons remain
non-significant).
Item analysis of individual word pairs. We performed item-level anal-
yses to examine graded effects from stimulation to individual word pairs
in the meaningful category. A traditional item analysis examines the
effect on each stimulus item by performing random-effects analyses
across items in the experiment instead of across subjects (Clark, 1973).
Because we could not repeat the same exact words across stimulation
sessions (to avoid repetition effects), our first item-level analysis was
designed to compare words pairs of the same rank across sessions. We
followed this with an ANCOVA using the actual item-level metrics in-
stead of ranks.
The use of ranks in the first item analysis allowed us to examine stim-
ulation effects at individual levels of semantic coherence. This approach
assumes that corresponding ranks reflect similar semantic coherence val-
ues across stimulus sets. As described in the stimulus materials section,
the design of our experimental stimuli involved systematically varying
the semantic coherence (i.e., the plausibility ratings of the combinations)
across the word pairs in the meaningful category in three sets of stimuli.
We performed extensive norming to create word pairs between sets that
were highly matched on semantic coherence on an individual basis, such
that item ranks could be used to compare levels of semantic coherence
across stimulus sets while avoiding repetition confounds. Indeed, the
semantic coherence values for word pairs with corresponding ranks were
nearly identical. We quantified how similar they were by taking the av-
erage absolute difference of semantic coherence values for all pairwise
comparisons of items with the same rank across the three stimulus sets.
The mean absolute difference in semantic coherence values for stimuli of
the same rank was 0.067 (SD � 0.045), which was 1.19% of the mean
semantic coherence of all meaningful word pairs. Additionally, the aver-
age correlation coefficient between all pairwise correlations of semantic
coherence values across the sets was almost 1 (i.e., set 1 to set 2 correla-
tion: r � 0.99; set 1 to set 3 correlation: r � 0.98; set 2 to set 3 correlation:
r � 0.98). Furthermore, these sets were counterbalanced across stimula-
tion sessions, such that each set was run equally for each type of brain
stimulation condition.
Thus to perform this item analysis, the meaningful word pairs were
ranked by their semantic coherence values for each session for all sub-
jects. Using ranked semantic coherence allowed us to look at changes in
reaction time for individual items, by averaging across participants’ re-
action time data for word pairs of the same rank in each stimulation
condition and then taking the difference in reaction time for items of the
same rank in different stimulation conditions (e.g., reaction time for left
AG word-pair rank 1 minus reaction time for sham word-pair rank 1;
where negative values indicate an advantage gained by left AG stimula-
tion relative to sham stimulation). We then performed two-tailed corre-
lations across the ranked items to test for graded differential effects to the
word pairs from stimulation.
To ensure that the effects from the item-analysis above were not solely
driven by the use of ranks instead of the actual semantic coherence met-
rics for each item in the meaningful category, we performed an analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) using the exact semantic coherence values for
each item, with a dependent variable of reaction time and independent
variables for subject (random), stimulation condition (fixed), and se-
mantic coherence values (random).
Results
Participants were unable to distinguish the sham session from
real tDCS above chance level (p � 0.77, proportions test), dem-
onstrating that the HD sham protocol was effective at blinding
the participants to the sham session. There were no differences in
ratings of tingling sensations (average tingling sensation � 2.45,
SD � 2.51; F(2,32) � 1.06, p � 0.36, one-way repeated-measures
ANOVA), or in ratings of burning sensations (average burning
sensation � 2.14, SD � 2.26; F(2,32) � 2.1, p � 0.14) between
stimulation conditions.
Based on the norming study, we expected participants’ accu-
racy to be highly accurate on both tasks for all sessions. To test for
possible accuracy changes across sessions in each task, we con-
ducted a repeated-measures ANOVA for accuracy by stimulation
condition. Participants were highly accurate at both the combi-
natorial word-pair task (average accuracy � 95.1%, SD � 2.8%)
and the letter-string control task (average accuracy � 96.9%,
SD � 2.0%). There was no effect of stimulation on accuracy in
the combinatorial word-pair task (F(2,32) � 0.01, p � 0.99). There
was no effect of stimulation on accuracy in the letter-string con-
trol task (F(2,32) � 0.76, p � 0.48).
In the first set of reaction-time analyses, we examined the
performance advantage in the word-pair task and letter-string
task across subjects. Next, we examined the specific effects on
individual word pairs in the meaningful word-pair category.
Reaction time effects on categories in each task: random-
effects across participants
For the reaction time analyses, we hypothesized that stimulation
to the left AG would produce a greater processing advantage for
meaningful relative to non-meaningful word pairs when com-
pared with the other stimulation conditions (i.e., sham and right
AG). If the left AG encodes high-level associative information

 from multiple lexical-semantic inputs, then stimulation to the
left AG should specifically facilitate the representation of mean-
ingful combinations, which have more abundant semantic asso-
ciations than the non-meaningful combinations. Furthermore,
we expected that if there were any effect on non-meaningful word
pairs, it would be in the opposite direction because left AG stim-
ulation might elicit specious semantic associations for these word
pairs.
In the word-pair task, a repeated-measures ANOVA of stim-
ulation condition (left AG, right AG, and sham) by word-pair
category (meaningful and non-meaningful) showed no main ef-
fect of word-pair category (F(1,16) � 1.90, p � 0.19), no main
effect of stimulation condition (F(2,32) � 0.91, p � 0.41), and a
trending interaction of word-pair category and stimulation con-
dition (F(2,32) � 3.09, p � 0.059). We next performed planned
comparisons to test our primary experimental hypothesis. As ex-
plained in the Data Analysis section of the Materials and Meth-
ods, we examined direct comparisons of the difference scores for
the word-pair categories across stimulation conditions to test for
changes in the relative processing advantage of meaningful com-
binations (Fig. 3A,B). As hypothesized, we found that anodal
stimulation to the left AG resulted in a greater processing advan-
tage for meaningful relative to non-meaningful word pairs com-
pared with both sham stimulation (t(16) � 1.96, p � 0.03, Cohen’s
d � 0.61) and right AG stimulation (t(16) � 1.91, p � 0.04, Co-
hen’s d � 0.71), shown in Figure 3A.
In the letter-string task, a repeated-measures ANOVA of stim-
ulation condition (left AG, right AG, and sham) by letter-string
category (match and non-match) showed a main effect of letter-
string category (F(1,16) � 18.9, p � 0.001), no main effect of
stimulation condition (F(2,32) � 1.79, p � 0.18), and no interac-
tion between letter-string category and stimulation condition
(F(2,32) � 0.66, p � 0.52). We next performed direct comparisons
of difference scores for the letter-string categories across stimu-
lation conditions. These analyses showed no differential effects in
the processing of letter-string categories between any of the stim-
ulation conditions (all p values � 0.25) shown in Figure 3B.
To further quantify the effect of real versus sham stimulation
on each word-pair category, we examined the percentage change
in reaction time relative to sham, plotted in Figure 3C. The use of
percentage change has the benefit of normalizing effects within
each subject relative to a baseline measure. A repeated-measures
ANOVA of the percentage change data showed no main effect of
word-pair category (F(1,16) � 0.71, p � 0.41), no main effect of
stimulation condition (F(1,16) � 2.39, p � 0.14), and a trending
interaction between word-pair category and stimulation condi-
tion (F(1,16) � 3.83, p � 0.068). As expected, a direct comparison
between the percentage change for the meaningful word pairs
revealed a significant difference between the left and right AG
stimulation sessions (t(16) � 2.48, p � 0.01), whereas there was
not a significant difference for the non-meaningful word pairs
between left and right AG stimulation sessions (t(16) � 0.57, p �
0.29). When we performed the percentage-change analysis on the
letter-string task, a repeated-measures ANOVA showed no main
effect of letter string category (F(1,16) � 2.15, p � 0.16), no main
effect of stimulation condition (F(1,16) � 1.63, p � 0.22), and no
interaction between letter-string category and stimulation condi-
tion (F(2,32) � 0.08, p � 0.78).
These results demonstrate anatomic specificity across partic-
ipants: this effect was specific to anodal stimulation of the left AG,
and did not occur for the sham condition or the anodal right AG
condition. Furthermore, stimulation produced this effect in the
word-pair task but not in the letter-string task.
Reaction time effects on individual word pairs in the
meaningful category: random-effects across word pairs
Next, we performed a series of item-level analyses to examine
more fine-grained measures of how stimulation affected the
meaningful word pairs on an individual basis. Specifically, we
examined how the effects of stimulation related to the degree of
semantic coherence across the meaningful word pairs. Using
ranked coherence, we found that the change in reaction time
between the left AG session and the sham session was strongly
correlated with the degree of semantic coherence of the word

 pairs (r � 0.65, p � 0.001), shown in Figure 4. This effect was not
observed for the same item analysis comparing right AG to sham
(r � 0.24, p � 0.17). To ensure that these results were not driven
by differences in the items’ reaction times at baseline (e.g., a 10%
change would produce larger difference scores for items with
larger reaction times at baseline), we performed the same analysis
using relative changes in reaction time. The relative change in
reaction time was calculated as the difference across testing ses-
sions divided by the reaction time at baseline (i.e., in the sham
session). The results for the left AG compared with sham condi-
tion remained strongly significant when using these normalized
changes in reaction times (r � 0.62, p � 0.001).
We also performed an ANCOVA to test for an interaction of
stimulation session and semantic coherence using the exact co-
herence values of each item instead of item ranks. Consistent with
the findings from the item-rank analysis, we found a significant
interaction of stimulation session and semantic coherence
(F(2,1763) � 7.73, p � 0.001).
Altogether, the item analyses show that the effects from left
AG stimulation were graded, such that the size of the effect was
correlated with the degree of semantic coherence for the word
pairs. More specifically, our results demonstrate that the perfor-
mance gain from stimulation was greatest for the meaningful
combinations that were more challenging to integrate at baseline.
Discussion
The AG has been proposed to function as a critical hub in the
semantic memory system (Vigneau et al., 2006; Binder et al.,
2009; Binder and Desai, 2011; Bonner et al., 2013; Seghier, 2013).
However, it remains unclear whether the activation of this region
reflects a specific integrative role in semantic memory, whether it
could be attributed to other aspects of semantic processing, or
whether it is epiphenomenal to semantic comprehension.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the left AG is an
integrative region with a causal role in semantic comprehension
by applying anodal HD-tDCS in three separate brain-stimulation
sessions. We found evidence that anodal stimulation to the left
AG, but not the right AG or sham stimulation, modulated the
processing of meaningful relative to non-meaningful two-word
combinations during a comprehension task. Furthermore, there
were fine-grained effects on individual word pairs within the
meaningful category, with the size of the stimulation effect vary-
ing with a continuous measure of semantic coherence.
We found no effects in a letter-string control task, suggesting
that the behavioral findings cannot be easily attributed to non-
specific effects on attention, motor control, or low-level visual
processing. It is important to note that the order of the word-pair
and letter-string tasks was fixed across subjects. Effects from HD-
tDCS have been found to last for up to 2 h after the end of
stimulation, making it unlikely that there were stimulation effects
during the word-pair task but not during the letter-string task.
However, this leaves open the possibility that the task-specific
effects found here could be partially confounded with temporal
effects of stimulation. Nonetheless, this issue does not affect the
interpretation of the differential effects across stimulation condi-
tions for the word-pair task or the differential effects across levels
of semantic coherence in the item analyses.
Neurobiological properties of the AG
Previous neuroimaging studies have implicated the AG in the
process of building coherent representations from sequences of
individual words (Graves et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2011; Pallier et
al., 2011; Bemis and Pylkka
¨nen, 2013; Price et al., 2015b). Our
findings extend this previous work by showing that the AG is
causally involved in constructing higher-level meaning from in-
dividual words during semantic comprehension, and that this
process can be systematically manipulated using brain stimula-
tion. The integrative process of conceptual combination relies on
high-level conceptual associations acquired over years of experi-
ence. The idea that the AG encodes rich and highly abstract con-
ceptual information acquired over large time scales aligns well
with anatomic studies demonstrating that during postnatal de-
velopment the inferior parietal cortex undergoes a pronounced
expansion relative to unimodal sensory cortices (Hill et al., 2010).
Furthermore, consistent with its role in high-level language pro-
cesses, comparative anatomic studies suggest that this region has
also undergone a prominent evolutionary expansion in humans
relative to non-human primates (Orban et al., 2004; Van Essen
and Dierker, 2007; Sherwood et al., 2008; Hill et al., 2010).
Hubs of the semantic memory network
The stimulation protocol for this study was motivated by previ-
ous findings from an fMRI study (Price et al., 2015b). Our elec-
trode montage was designed to optimize stimulation at the peak
coordinate from the fMRI study in the left AG. It will be of inter-
est for future studies to explore the effects on combinatorial pro-
cessing from HD-tDCS to other proposed hubs in the lexical-
semantic network, which include the anterior temporal lobe
(ATL) and the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG).
The ATL in particular has been implicated in a broad range of
semantic-memory processes (Patterson et al., 2007; Visser et al.,
2010; Schwartz et al., 2011), including conceptual combination
(Baron et al., 2010; Bemis and Pylkka
¨nen, 2011; Coutanche and
Thompson-Schill, 2015). The most robust semantic memory ef-

 fects appear to be centered on ventromedial portions of the tem-
poral lobe, such as the anterior fusiform and parahippocampal
gyri (Mion et al., 2010; Bonner and Price, 2013; Bonner et al.,
2016). Although HD-tDCS is useful for targeting lateral surfaces
of the brain, it would be difficult to successfully target more ven-
tromedial regions using HD-tDCS because current density de-
creases with increasing cortical depth (Datta et al., 2008, 2009;
Faria et al., 2011). Additionally, using the 4 � 1 ring design would
likely involve electrode placement on facial locations, which
would pose problems due to high discomfort for participants and
a less-predictable flow of current.
It will be of interest in future work to understand how each of
these high-level hubs of the semantic system work in concert to
facilitate semantic integration (Molinaro et al., 2015). Another
important question in future work is to understand how stimu-
lation of more fine-grained subdivisions of the AG and posterior
middle temporal gyrus differentially affects combinatorial se-
mantic processes in language and vision (Seghier et al., 2010,
2013; Caspers et al., 2013; Davey et al., 2015).
Studies of brain stimulation to temporoparietal brain regions
Previous work has applied conventional anodal stimulation to
left temporoparietal regions and shown improved word learning,
as well as improved word reading (Flo
¨el et al., 2008; Turkeltaub et
al., 2012; Meinzer et al., 2014). In the current study, we found an
effect on the semantic integration of words pairs. Even when both
words in the pair were real words, matched on average single-
word frequency, the stimulation effect was specific to those word
pairs whose combinations were judged to be semantically mean-
ingful. Therefore, we interpret the results in this study as unlikely
to reflect only basic-level access to the individual words. Rather
these effects appear to encompass higher-level processing of the
word pair’s associated meaning. Integrating semantic informa-
tion is an integral aspect of both word learning and word reading,
and thus it may be that improvements in the processes of seman-
tic integration will be associated with faster word learning and
word reading over time. It is also worth noting that the conven-
tional tDCS used in the previous studies also affects relatively
larger regions of cortex, and stimulation to other temporal and
parietal regions outside of the AG may lead to broader effects on
the lexical-semantic network. Future work may be able to apply
HD-tDCS to different regions of the left hemisphere network to
identify differential contributions to word learning, word read-
ing, and integrative semantic memory mechanisms in temporo-
parietal regions.
Recent studies using other brain stimulation techniques, like
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), to study se-
mantic processing and the AG have also shown this region to be
causally involved in semantic memory tasks. When rTMS was
used to target the AG to disrupt neural processing, it resulted in
slowed reaction time on a semantic memory task but not on
phonological or visual letter-string discrimination tasks (Sliwin-
ska et al., 2015). In a related study, Hartwigsen et al. (2015b)
examined coupled TMS perturbation of temporoparietal regions
and IFG, and found semantic impairments when anterior IFG
perturbation was coupled with rTMS to the left AG, but not when
coupled with rTMS to the supramarginal gyrus. Hartwigsen et al.
(2015a) also found that the degree of interference from rTMS to
the left AG depended on the semantic predictability of sentences
during comprehension.
Altogether, previous brain-stimulation studies have broadly
implicated the AG in semantic processing. The findings in the
current study build on this previous work and demonstrate for
the first time a causal role for the AG in the process of semantic
integration. Our findings also complement perturbation studies
using rTMS by showing that excitatory stimulation from tDCS
can be used to enhance semantic processing, motivating the study
of tDCS as a potential therapy for patient populations with
lexical-semantic impairments.
Item-wise effects from brain stimulation
Many brain stimulation studies examine the effects of stimula-
tion on categories of stimuli through random-effects analyses
across participants. Here, we additionally examined the fine-
grained effects of stimulation on individual stimuli. Using this
approach, we were able to determine that the behavioral effects
from stimulation were graded in relation to a continuous metric
of semantic coherence. Of the meaningful word pairs, those that
were less coherent at baseline gained the most from stimulation.
It may be the case that stimulation to an associative region like the
AG disproportionately facilitates the integration of weaker se-
mantic associations. In contrast, word pairs that have strong se-
mantic associations at baseline are already easily integrated into
coherent combinations and may exhibit ceiling effects when as-
sessing performance gains from stimulation. Altogether, the
findings from this item-analysis demonstrate the strong relation-
ship between stimulation of the AG and measures of semantic
coherence. When possible, it may benefit future studies to di-
rectly examine the relationship between brain-stimulation effects
and specific item-level metrics for the phenomenon of interest.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the AG plays an important role in the
fluent composition of meaning in language. These results are
consistent with the broader theoretical claim that the AG func-
tions as a cortical semantic hub, characterized not only by the
amodal nature of its representations but also by its specific role in
high-level feature integration.
