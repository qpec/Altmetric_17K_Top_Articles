Abstract
Both sleep loss and pathogens can enhance brain inflammation, sleep, and sleep intensity as 
indicated by electroencephalogram delta (δ) power. The pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 
beta (IL-1β) is increased in the cortex after sleep deprivation (SD) and in response to the Gram-
negative bacterial cell-wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS), although the exact mechanisms 
governing these effects are unknown. The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat 
protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome protein complex forms in response to changes in the local 
environment and, in turn, activates caspase-1 to convert IL-1β into its active form. SD enhances 
the cortical expression of the somnogenic cytokine IL-1β, although the underlying mechanism is, 
as yet, unidentified. Using NLRP3-gene knockout (KO) mice, we provide evidence that NLRP3 
inflammasome activation is a crucial mechanism for the downstream pathway leading to increased 
IL-1β-enhanced sleep. NLRP3 KO mice exhibited reduced non-rapid eye movement (NREM) 
sleep during the light period. We also found that sleep amount and intensity (δ activity) were 
drastically attenuated in NLRP3 KO mice following SD (homeostatic sleep response), as well as 
after LPS administration, although they were enhanced by central administration of IL-1β. 
NLRP3, ASC, and IL1β mRNA, IL-1β protein, and caspase-1 activity were greater in the 
somatosensory cortex at the end of the wake-active period when sleep propensity was high and 
after SD in wild-type but not NLRP3 KO mice. Thus, our novel and converging findings suggest

1 Introduction
Many brain areas—including the cortex, thalamus, ventral lateral preoptic area, median 
preoptic nucleus, basal forebrain, and brainstem—are known to modulate NREM sleep 
(Brown et al., 2012; Szymusiak, 2010; Saper et al., 2010). In particular, somatosensory 
cortex activity modulates sleep and the electroencephalogram (EEG) (Timofeev et al., 2013). 
Increased wakefulness, such as that occurring during sleep deprivation (SD), enhances the 
expression of pro-inflammatory molecules in the somatosensory cortex including 
interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) (Zielinski et al., 2011; Imeri and Opp, 2009). IL-1β expression 
and protein levels in the cortex exhibit diurnal variations that coincide with sleep propensity 
(Krueger et al., 2010; Taishi et al., 1998; 2012). IL-1β applied centrally or to the periphery 
enhances NREM sleep in rabbits, rats, and mice (Zielinski et al., 2011; Obal et al., 1995; 
Olivadoti and Opp, 2008; Toth and Opp, 2001), although higher dosages can inhibit sleep 
(Opp et al., 1991). Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms for cortical IL-1β regulation of sleep 
are unknown.
EEG NREM sleep delta (δ) power spectra (0.5-4 Hz frequency range; also referred to as 
slow-wave activity) is often used as an indicator of sleep need after acute SD (Davis et al., 
2011). NREM sleep δ power is, in part, regulated by a thalamo-cortico-thalamo loop 
(Steriade, 2006). While the exact mechanism(s) responsible for the NREM sleep δ power are 
unknown, pro-inflammatory molecules tend to enhance it (Zielinski et al., 2011; Imeri and 
Opp, 2009), for example, IL-1β enhances NREM sleep δ power in animals when applied to 
the brain (Tobler et al., 1994; Krueger et al., 1984), although mice exhibit reductions after 
IL-1β is applied to the periphery. This might be due to the activation of the anti-somnogenic 
properties of the hypothalamic-pituitary-axis (Krueger et al., 2010; Zielinski et al., 2012). 
Moreover, inhibiting IL-1β pharmacologically can attenuate NREM sleep δ power responses 
from SD (Takahahi et al., 1997).
The Gram-negative bacterial cell wall component lipopolysaccharide (LPS) enhances sleep, 
NREM sleep δ power, and cortical IL-1β expression (Zielinski et al., 2011; Imeri and Opp, 
2009). These responses, however, differ depending upon the route of administration, dosage, 
and pathogen or related component. LPS administered to the periphery or to the brain 
enhances various cytokines in the brain/cortex, including IL-1β (Noh et al., 2014; Henry et 
al., 2008, 2009; Zielinski et al., 2012; Lawson et al., 2013). Notwithstanding, the precise 
mechanisms of how pathogens and their components enhance cortical IL-1β-mediated sleep 
are not well understood.

 Inflammasomes are inducible protein complexes that form in reaction to various biological 
and chemical substances, as well as pathogens and their components, including LPS, which 
act through their respective pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) (Elliott and Sutterwala, 
2015). The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor (NLR) family members 
NLRP1, NLRP3 and NLRC4 and the AIM2-like receptor (ALR) family member AIM2 have 
all been shown to be able to form inflammasome complexes in response to either pathogen-
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). 
Upon activation, NLRP3 recruits the adaptor molecule ASC [apoptosis-associated speck-like 
protein containing a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)], which in turn recruits 
the cysteine protease caspase-1. Caspase-1 activation subsequently results in the processing 
of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into their mature secreted forms.
1.1 Conceptual overview of the NLRP3 inflammasome in sleep regulation
Growing evidence indicates that the NLRP3 inflammasome in the brain is involved in 
certain behavior, such as stress-mediated depression-like and anxiety-like behavior (Zhang et 
al., 2015; Wong et al., 2016). Currently, the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in sleep 
regulation remains unknown. We hypothesized that the NLRP3 inflammasome functions to 
enhance sleep and NREM sleep δ power. Using two experimental models that have been 
previously shown to increase IL-1β, SD and LPS administration (Reviewed Zielinski and 
Krueger 2011), we determined the effects of increased wakefulness on the activation of the 
NLRP3 inflammasome in the somatosensory cortex. In addition, we determined the effect of 
increased wakefulness which enhances NREM δ during recovery sleep, and central 
administration of LPS on sleep and NREM sleep δ power in mice specifically lacking 
NLRP3 so as to investigate the effects of a well-known somnogenic substance that also 
activates NLRP3 inflammasomes within the brain. To our knowledge, mice lacking NLRP3 
are not reported to show any gross behavioral deficits or alterations in motor activity, though 
they exhibit attenuated immunological responses to LPS and muramyl dipeptide (Zhang, Z-
T et al., 2016; Kovarova et al., 2012). We believe these data show, for the first time, 
converging evidence that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in spontaneous sleep 
and sleep responses following SD and LPS challenge. Compared to controls, mice lacking 
NLRP3 showed decreased spontaneous NREM sleep, reduced NREM sleep and NREM 
sleep δ power responses to SD, and failed to increase caspase-1 activity and IL-1β protein in 
the somatosensory cortex after SD. Moreover, LPS infusion in the lateral ventricle produced 
differences paralleling those seen with SD.
2 Methods
2.1 Animals
Two-month-old male NLRP3 KO mice (B6.129S6-Nlrp3tm1Bhk, which were backcrossed 
with C57BL6J mice for 10 generations) and C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) control mice (N = 
7-8 per genotype) were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and 
bred and maintained for 2 generations at the Veterans Affairs (VA) Boston Healthcare 
System animal resource facilities. Mice were genotyped using primers as indicated by 
Jackson Laboratories. Mice were housed individually and water and food were provided ad 
libitum throughout the experiments. Mice were maintained on a 12:12 h light/dark cycle

 [light onset Zeitgeber (ZT) 0] at 22 ± 3 °C. All experimental protocols were approved by the 
VA Boston Healthcare system Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were in 
compliance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines.
2.2 Polysomnography surgery and analysis
Mice used for polysomnography surgery were anesthetized with isoflurane (1-2%) and 
surgically implanted with an EEG electrode in the somatosensory cortex (1 mm posterior to 
bregma and 1 mm lateral to the midline) and a ground electrode over the cerebellum (0.5 
mm posterior to lambda placed centrally) as previously described (Zielinski et al., 2013). 
Mice were also implanted with two electromyogram (EMG) electrodes in the nuchal 
muscles. The electrodes were attached to a pedestal and formed into a head mount with 
dental cement. Mice were tethered to wireless transponders (F20-EET transponders; Data 
Sciences International, St. Paul, MN, USA) on a swivel mounted system (Neurotargeting 
Systems, Inc., Chestnut Hill, MA, USA) allowing the mice to move freely in their cage as 
previously described (Zielinski et al., 2013). The cages were positioned on top of receiver 
plates that functioned to detect potential data from FM signals from the transponders to a 
data exchange matrix (Data Sciences International, St. Paul, MN, USA). The signals were 
transferred to a computer using the Dataquest A.R.T system. The EEG and EMG signals 
were converted to European data files and then filtered below 0.1 Hz and above 40 Hz.
Polysomnography data were analyzed manually in 10-second epochs off-line using 
SleepSign Software (Kissei Comtech Co., Ltd., Japan). Vigilance states—including NREM 
sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and waking—were determined in 2-h time blocks 
as previously described (Zielinski et al., 2013). Vigilance state episode duration and episode 
frequencies were determined in 12-h light and dark time blocks and during periods of 
experimental treatments as previously described (Zielinski et al., 2012). Fast Fourier 
transformations of EEG signals (μV2) using a Hanning window were made within each 10-
second epoch for each sleep state. EEG power spectra were analyzed in 0.25 Hz bins in the 
frequency range of 0.5–20 Hz for 24-h periods. Additionally, NREM sleep δ power spectra 
in the EEG (0.5–4 Hz) was determined as a percentage of total EEG power spectra across a 
24-h period in 2-h time bins for each individual mouse. EEG power spectra analysis between 
0.5-20 Hz frequency ranges during the specified duration of the experimental treatment sleep 
states was normalized as a fractional percentage of total power spectra within the 0.5–20 Hz 
range of the respective control treatment. EEG power spectra analysis was performed for 
light and dark periods during for each sleep state during spontaneous sleep and sleep after 
experimental treatments.
2.3 Experimental treatments
Mice used for polysomnography treatments were allowed to sleep ad libitum, and sleep was 
recorded for 24 h beginning at dark onset (ZT 12). Mice were continuously sleep deprived 
by the gentle handling method for 6 h prior to dark onset (ZT 6-12). The 6 h of SD was 
placed at this time-of-day because IL-1β expression and NREM sleep are at their nadir 
which enhances the ability to detect SD-induced increases in cortical IL-1β, EEG δ power, 
and NREM sleep (as previously described Zielinski et al., 2012). Recovery sleep was 
recorded for 24 h as previously described (Zielinski et al., 2013). Mice were infused

 intracerebroventricularly (ICV) with LPS from E. coli (L2630, lot 122M9001V, Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; 100 ng in 5 μl of 0.9% NaCl), carrier-free IL-1β (R & D 
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; 10 ng in 5 μl of 0.9% NaCl), or the vehicle (0.9% NaCl 
per 5 min) for 5 min prior to dark onset (ZT 12), and sleep was recorded for 24 h. All mice 
received the same LPS batch. Additional mice that were allowed ad libitum sleep were 
sacrificed for molecular analysis after the active-dark period at light onset (ZT 0) and after 
the less active light period at dark onset (ZT 12) and served as controls. Further, a group of 
mice were sleep deprived for 6 h prior to dark onset (post-SD ZT 12) and culled 
immediately thereafter for molecular analysis.
2.4 Tissue collection
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated, brains removed, and bilateral 
somatosensory cortices (between bregma at 1.98 mm to -2.46 mm and ± 2 mm in the dorsal 
ventral directions relative to the parietotemporal ridge) were dissected on a frozen petri dish 
as previously described (Zielinski et al., 2012). The brain tissue was flash frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for analysis of protein and gene expression.
2.5 Gene expression analysis
Tissue was homogenized and RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Thermo-Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was 
prepared from each RNA sample using a TaqMan Reverse Transcription kit (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NLRP3 
(Mm00840904_m1), ASC (Mm00445747_g1), and IL-1β (Mm00434228_m1) primers were 
chosen using Primer Express Software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). 18s 
ribosomal RNA (Hs99999901_s1) was used as an internal standard for normalization. Levels 
of mRNA of the genes of interest were analyzed using real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) as previously described (Zielinski et al., 2014). Gene expression values of the 
genes of interest were used to quantify differences in light vs. dark periods and SD vs. time-
of-day matched ad libitum sleeping controls using the cycle threshold (Ct) value method as 
previously described (Zielinski et al., 2014). Briefly, the change in values were calculated by 
subtracting the mean 18s Ct value from the control treatment. The gene expression was 
determined using the formula 2ˆ – (change in Ct for experimental treatment from the 
baseline control mean) – (change in Ct for the baseline experimental treatment from the 
baseline control mean).
2.6 Protein analysis
Tissue was homogenized using N-PER (Thermo-Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) 
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein amounts were quantified using a 
bicinchoninic acid protein assay (BCA) kit (Thermoscientific, Waltham, MA, USA) 
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Equal aliquots containing 100 μg amounts of 
protein were used to determine caspase-1 activity using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biovision Inc., Milpitas, CA, 
USA). In addition, equal aliquots containing 100 μg amounts of protein were used to 
determine IL-1β protein levels using an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer's 
instructions (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA; sensitivity 4.8 pg/mL).

 2.7 Statistical analysis
One-, two-, and three-way analysis of variance were used to determine statistical 
significance for sleep and molecular data analysis with IBM SPSS software (Chicago, IL, 
USA). Independent and paired t-tests were used for post-hoc analysis. Significance was set 
at p < 0.05. Bonferroni corrections were made for multiple comparisons. Data are presented 
as means ± standard error of the measurement (SEM).
3 Results
3.1 Spontaneous sleep
To determine the role of NLRP3 gene in spontaneous sleep, we assessed sleep architecture 
of NLRP3 KO mice using polysomnography. Modest yet significant differences in 
spontaneous sleep duration and EEG power spectra were found between NLRP3 KO mice 
and WT controls (Figs 1 and 2).
3.1.1 NLRP3 KO mice sleep less during light period—Spontaneous NREM and 
REM sleep exhibited a diurnal pattern in both NLRP3 KO and WT mice with greater 
durations occurring during the light period compared to the dark period [NREM sleep (Fig 
1A): F (1, 14) = 17.157, p = 0.001; WT: 165.3 ± 18.3 min; NLRP3 KO: 106.4 ± 30.8 min; 
REM sleep (Fig 1B): WT: 25.0 ± 4.5 min; NLRP3 KO: 32.9 ± 6.6 min] occurring during the 
light period compared to the dark period [F (1, 14) = 14.069, p = 0.002]. The amount of 
spontaneous wakefulness showed a diurnal rhythm in both NLRP3 KO and WT mice with 
larger amounts in the dark period vs. the light period [F (1, 14) = 18.347, p = 0.001; WT: 
190.4 ± 20.8 min; NLRP3 KO: 139.2 ± 35.7 min] (Fig 1C). Spontaneous NREM and REM 
sleep values during light and dark periods for WT mice were similar to those previously 
reported in the literature (Zielinski et al., 2012). However, NLRP3 KO mice had reduced 
amounts of NREM sleep (-68.7 ± 22.8 min) during the light period compared to that of WT 
mice [genotype: F (1, 14) = 4.981, p = 0.042].). No significant differences between 
genotypes were found for sleep episode durations or episode frequencies during light or dark 
periods (Table 1). However, a main effect was found in NLRP3 KO mice and WT mice for 
greater NREM sleep, REM sleep, and waking episode frequencies and REM sleep and 
waking episode durations during the dark period compared to the light period [F (1, 14) = 
39.626, p < 0.001; F (1, 14) = 45.990, p < 0.001; F (1, 14) = 20.591, p < 0.001; F (1, 14) = 
5.331, p = 0.037; F (1, 14) = 13.852, p = 0.002, respectively]. This contributed to the diurnal 
variations in sleep state amounts.
3.1.2 NLRP3 KO mice have altered EEG power spectra—Since the NLRP3 
inflammasome is a major activator of mature IL-1β which increases NREM sleep EEG δ 
power, we investigated EEG power spectra frequencies during sleep states of spontaneous 
sleep and wakefulness. In NLRP3 KO mice and WT mice, a main effect was found for 
spontaneous NREM sleep EEG δ power spectra (0.5-4 Hz frequency range) being greater 
during the dark period compared to the light period [F (1, 14) = 5.885, p = 0.029] (Fig 1D). 
However, this diurnal variation was evident only in WT mice [WT: F (1, 7) = 6.546, p = 
0.038]. A main effect was found for WT and NLRP3 KO mice exhibiting greater NREM 
sleep EEG power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) during the dark period compared to 
Zielinski et al.

 the light period [light period vs. dark period: F (1, 1106) = 58.635, p < 0.001] (Figs 2A and 
2B). This effect varied depending upon the EEG frequency power spectra band and between 
genotypes [light period vs. dark period × frequency interaction: F (78, 1106) = 5.020, p < 
0.001; light period vs. dark period × genotype interaction: F (78, 1106) = 3.348, p < 0.001]. 
In NLRP3 KO and WT mice, a main effect was observed for greater REM sleep EEG power 
spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) during the dark period compared to the light period 
[light period vs. dark period: F (78, 1106) = 1.541, p = 0.002] (Figs 2C and 2D). Wake EEG 
power spectra values (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) were greater during the dark period 
compared to the light period in WT and NLRP3 KO mice [light period vs. dark period main 
effect: F (1, 1106) = 80.510, p < 0.001] (Figs 2E and 2F).
3.1.3 NLRP3 KO mice do not demonstrate greater values of molecular 
components of the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway during times of high sleep 
propensity—We found that WT mice exhibited greater caspase-1 activity in the 
somatosensory cortex at the beginning of the light period (ZT 0) compared to the start of the 
dark period (ZT 12) [F (1, 14) = 19.271, p = 0.001] (Fig 3A). However, somatosensory 
cortex caspase-1 activity levels during the beginning of the light and dark periods were 
similar in NLRP3 KO mice. In the somatosensory cortex, greater inflammasome-related 
component mRNA expression levels were found at the beginning of the light period 
compared to the commencement of the dark period in WT mice [NLRP3: F (1, 14) = 16.127, 
p = 0.001; ASC: F (1, 14) = 11.588, p = 0.004; IL-1β: F (1, 14) = 17.384, p = 0.001] (Table 
2). However, NLRP3 KO mice demonstrated similar inflammasome-related component 
mRNA expression levels at the beginning of the light period compared to the start of the 
dark period. A main effect was observed for elevated IL-1β protein levels in the 
somatosensory cortex at the start of the light period (ZT 0) compared to beginning of the 
dark period (ZT 12) [F (1, 28) = 10.588, p = 0.003] (Fig 3B). Notwithstanding, an 
interaction was observed between the two mouse genotypes and the photoperiod for IL-1β 
protein levels [F (1, 28) = 6.237, p = 0.019]. IL-1β protein levels were greater during the 
light period than the dark period for WT but not NLRP3 mice [WT: F (1, 14) = 12.222, p = 
0.004]. WT mice had greater IL-1β protein levels than NLRP3 KO mice [genotype main 
effect: F (1, 28) = 6.838, p = 0.014], although this effect only occurred during the beginning 
of the light period [F (1, 28) = 9.797, p = 0.007].
3.2 Responses to SD
Homeostatic enhanced NREM sleep responses to SD were attenuated in NLRP3 KO mice 
compared to WT controls (Fig 4). Furthermore, NLRP3 KO mice did not demonstrate 
enhancement of inflammasome-related molecular components within the somatosensory 
cortex after SD (Fig 3).
3.2.1 Recovery sleep responses after SD are attenuated in NLRP3 KO mice—
SD by gentle handling was effective in both WT and NLRP3 KO mice in preventing NREM 
and REM sleep during the procedure when compared with baseline spontaneous sleep 
[NREM sleep (WT): 94.8 ± 2.1 %; (NLRP3 KO): 97.4 ± 1.1 %) (Fig 4A); NREM sleep: F 
(1, 28) = 377.310, p < 0.001; REM sleep (WT): 98.9 ± 0.6 %; (NLRP3 KO): 93.7 ± 2.1 %) 
(Fig 4B)]; REM sleep: F (1, 28) = 194.911, p < 0.001]. Conversely, wakefulness was

 enhanced in both genotypes during the SD procedure when compared with baseline values 
[F (1, 28) = 441.262, p < 0.001] (Fig 4C).
An interaction was found between the SD treatment and mouse genotypes for NREM sleep 
duration during the first 6 h of sleep occurring after SD (ZT 12-18, i.e., recovery sleep) [F 
(1, 28) = 5.898, p = 0.022] (Fig 4A). WT mice showed enhanced NREM sleep duration 
during recovery sleep compared to baseline values [F (1, 14) = 11.187, p = 0.005; duration 
change: 63.5 ± 16.0 min]. However, NREM sleep responses during recovery sleep were not 
significantly different from baseline values in NLRP3 KO mice [-6.2 ± 11.8 min]. The 
enhancement in NREM sleep duration displayed in WT mice was, in part, the result of an 
increased frequency of NREM sleep episodes [F (1, 14) = 4.765, p = 0.047; baseline: 96.38 
± 18.15; recovery sleep: 187.88 ± 37.78]. A main effect was found for mice having 
enhanced REM sleep duration during the first 6 h of recovery sleep compared to their 
baseline values [F (1, 28) = 5.190, p = 0.031] (Fig 4B). This effect, though, was only seen in 
WT mice [WT: F (1, 14) = 13.888, p = 0.002; WT: 14.3 ± 2.7 min change; NLRP3 KO: 3.8 
± 3.2 min]. An increased frequency of REM sleep episodes contributed to the enhanced 
REM sleep durations was found during recovery sleep of WT mice [F (1, 14) = 6.531, p = 
0.023; baseline: 15.63 ± 2.58; recovery sleep: 45.88 ± 11.55]. A main effect was found for 
reduced wakefulness occurring during the first 6 h of recovery sleep after SD compared to 
baseline values [treatment main effect: F (1, 28) = 5.190, p = 0.031]. This main effect was 
attributed to reductions in wakefulness found in WT but not NLRP3 KO mice [treatment × 
genotype interaction: F (1, 28) = 5.871, p = 0.022; WT (treatment): F (1, 14) = 12.594, p = 
0.003: WT: -77.8 ± 17.9 min; NLRP3 KO: 2.4 ± 14.5 min] (Fig 4C). In WT mice, the 
attenuation in wakefulness ensued, in part, from a reduction in the duration of waking 
episode bouts during sleep recovery compared to baseline [F (1, 14) = 6.034, p = 0.028; 
baseline: 4.06 ± 0.99 min; recovery sleep: 1.46 ± 0.37 min].
3.2.2 The homeostatic enhancement in NREM sleep delta power after SD is 
attenuated in NLRP3 KO mice—WT mice exhibited enhanced NREM sleep δ power 
(0.5-4 Hz frequency range) values during the first 2 h of recovery sleep after SD compared 
to spontaneous baseline values [WT: F (1, 14) = 11.125, p = 0.005]. This effect was not 
found in NLRP3 KO mice [treatment × genotype interaction: F (1, 28) = 4.216, p = 0.049] 
(Fig 4D). A main effect was found for lower NREM sleep δ power 11-12 h after SD 
compared to baseline values [F (1, 28) = 6.832, p = 0.014]. However, WT mice 
demonstrated a negative rebound in NREM sleep δ power [WT: F (1, 14) = 11.337, p = 
0.005], which was not observed in NLRP3 KO mice [treatment × genotype interaction: F (1, 
28) = 8.524, p = 0.007].
To confirm the homeostatic alterations in NREM sleep δ power after SD found in WT mice, 
we evaluated EEG power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) during the first 2 h of 
recovery sleep. A main effect was shown in NLRP3 KO and WT mice for enhanced NREM 
sleep EEG power spectra during the first 2 h of recovery sleep compared to baseline values 
[F (1, 1106) = 304.084, p < 0.001](Figs 4E and 4F). This effect depended upon the 
frequency of the power spectra and the mouse genotype that was, in part, evident in the 
NREM sleep δ power findings [treatment × frequency × genotype interaction: F (78, 1106) = 
1.754, p < 0.001; treatment × genotype interaction: F (1, 1106) = 71.344, p < 0.001;

 frequency × genotype interaction: F (78, 1106) = 2.105, p < 0.001; treatment × frequency 
interaction: F (78, 1106) = 2.214, p < 0.001; genotype: F (1, 1106) = 50.582, p < 0.001].
We also determined the NREM sleep EEG power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) 
occurring 11-12 h after SD based upon the significant attenuation in NREM sleep δ power 
exhibited in WT mice. NREM sleep EEG power spectra was different in particular 
frequency bands and between genotypes that was consistent with the NREM sleep δ power 
findings [treatment × frequency interaction: F (78, 1106) = 1.943, p < 0.001; genotype × 
frequency interaction: F (78, 1106) = 1.543, p = 0.002; treatment × frequency interaction: F 
(78, 553) = 2.522, p < 0.001] (Figs 4G and 4H).
3.2.3 NLRP3 inflammasome-related molecular components are enhanced in 
the somatosensory cortex after SD—Immediately after SD (ZT 12), caspase-1 
activity in the somatosensory cortex was enhanced relative to baseline time-of-day (ZT 12) 
controls in WT but not NLRP3 KO mice [WT: F (1, 14) = 30.029, p < 0.001] (Fig 3A). In 
WT mice, NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1β mRNA expression in the somatosensory cortex was 
increased after SD compared to baseline values [NLRP3: F (1, 14) = 16.127, p = 0.001; 
ASC: F (1, 14) = 11.588, p = 0.004, IL-1β: F (1, 14) = 17.384, p = 0.001] (Table 2). NLRP3 
mice did not exhibit significant SD-induced differences in the expression of the measured 
NLRP3 inflammasome-related genes. Main effects were found for greater IL-1β protein 
levels in WT than NLRP3 KO mice and for SD enhancing IL-1β protein levels [genotype: F 
(1, 28) = 13.549, p = 0.001; treatment; F (1, 28) = 13.549, p = 0.001] (Fig 3B). NLRP3 KO 
mice did not show significant increased IL-1β protein levels after SD. This SD-induced 
effect was only found in WT mice [treatment × genotype interaction: F (1, 28) = 12.819, p = 
0.001; WT (treatment): F (1, 14) = 20.537, p < 0.001].
3.3 Responses to LPS
To determine the role of NLRP3-induced sleep by the somnogenic bacterial cell wall 
component LPS in the brain, we determined sleep architecture responses after ICV infusions 
of LPS. First, we analyzed sleep responses after ICV infusions of the vehicle at dark onset 
(ZT 0) (Fig 5). Following ICV vehicle infusions, NLRP3 KO mice demonstrated reduced 
sleep over a 24 h period compared to WT mice [F (1, 26) = 9.629, p = 0.005], with lower 
amounts occurring during both the light (ZT 0-12) and dark periods (ZT 12-0) [light period: 
F (1, 26) = 6.058, p = 0.021; -58.8 ± 22.1 min difference; dark period: F (1, 26) = 4.892, p = 
0.036; 39.2 ± -14.2 min difference]. NLRP3 KO mice exhibited greater REM sleep duration 
during the dark period compared to WT mice (ZT 12-0) [F (1, 26) = 13.786, p = 0.001; 14.1 
± 3.4 min difference]. However, REM sleep duration during the light period and during 
wakefulness were not different between genotypes. Second, we determined sleep and NREM 
sleep EEG δ power spectra responses to ICV applied LPS, which were attenuated in NLRP3 
KO mice compared to WT controls.
3.3.1 Enhanced sleep responses after ICV infusions of LPS are attenuated in 
NLRP3 KO mice—An interaction was observed between the NLRP3 KO and WT mouse 
genotypes and ICV LPS and between vehicle and LPS treatment responses for NREM sleep 
during the first 12 h post-LPS infusion [treatment × genotype interaction: F (1, 38) = 17.055,

 p < 0.001] (Fig 6A). WT mice exhibited enhanced NREM sleep during the first 12 h post-
LPS infusion compared to that of the vehicle [F (1, 19) = 11.851, p = 0.003; WT: 111.6 
± 38.6 min]. Nevertheless, there were no significant differences in NREM sleep episode 
frequencies or episode durations after LPS infusions compared to the vehicle. NREM sleep 
responses to LPS were not significantly different from the vehicle for NLRP3 KO mice and 
displayed a slight but non-significant reduction in NREM sleep [NLRP3 KO: -45.5 ± 14.4 
min]. A genotype × treatment interaction was found for the amount of REM sleep during the 
first 12 h post-LPS infusion compared to vehicle values for NLRP3 KO and WT mice [F (1, 
38) = 8.782, p = 0.005] (Fig 6B). Yet, post-hoc analysis indicated that LPS did not 
significantly alter REM sleep durations in either genotype (WT: 9.2 ± 6.3 min; NLRP3 KO: 
-11.8 ± 2.1 min). The enhanced NREM sleep duration responses seen in WT mice 
contributed to a reduction in their wakefulness that was only found in WT mice [treatment × 
genotype main interaction: F (1, 38) = 17.803, p < 0.001; WT (treatment): F (1, 19) = 
11.346, p = 0.003; WT: -120.8 ± 42.0 min; NLRP3 KO: 57.4 ± 16.1 min] (Fig 6C). The 
reduced wakefulness seen in WT was, in part, attributed to LPS-induced reductions in the 
durations of waking episode bouts [F (1, 19) = 7.598, p = 0.013; WT (vehicle): 1.31 ± 0.15; 
WT (post-LPS): 0.67 ± 0.11 min].
3.3.2 EEG delta power spectra enhancements after ICV infusions of LPS are 
attenuated in NLRP3 KO mice—Since LPS can affect NREM sleep EEG δ power, we 
investigated this measure after ICV infusions in NLRP3 KO and WT mice. A main effect 
was found for enhanced NREM sleep δ power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) during 
the first 4 h (ZT 12-15) post-LPS infusion compared to vehicle values and for greater NREM 
sleep δ power spectra in WT mice compared to NLRP3 KO mice [treatment: F (1, 24) = 
7.031, p = 0.014; genotype: F (1, 24) = 4.714, p = 0.040] (Fig 6D). An interaction was 
observed between mouse genotypes and LPS and vehicle treatments for NREM sleep δ 
power spectra where WT but not NLRP3 KO mice exhibited enhancements in NREM sleep 
δ power spectra [genotype × treatment interaction: F (1, 24) = 11.381, p = 0.003; WT: F (1, 
12) = 10.925, p = 0.006].
We further determined the NREM sleep EEG power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) 
during the first 4 h (ZT 12-15) post-LPS infusion compared to vehicle when NREM sleep δ 
power spectra was significantly enhanced in WT mice. A main effect was observed for LPS 
enhancing NREM sleep EEG power spectra in responses to LPS in both WT and NLRP3 
KO mice [treatment: F (1, 948) = 36.384, p < 0.001] (Figs 6E and 6F). Additionally, a main 
effect was found for greater NREM sleep EEG power in WT mice compared to NLRP3 KO 
mice. However, NREM sleep EEG power responses to infusions of LPS differed in 
particular frequency bands depending upon the mouse genotype which was in accord with 
the NREM sleep δ power results [treatment × frequency × genotype: F (78, 948) = 2.995, p 
< 0.001; treatment × frequency: F (78, 948) = 4.797, p < 0.001; frequency × genotype; F 
(78, 948) = 4.953, p < 0.001; treatment × genotype: F (1, 948) = 127.491, p < 0.001].
3.4 Responses to IL-1β
As previously mentioned, IL-1β activation is located downstream of the NLRP3 
inflammasome protein complex formation (Elliott and Sutterwala, 2015). Thus, we

 investigated the sleep and EEG power responses of NLRP3 KO mice after ICV infusions of 
IL-1β. Largely, NLRP3 KO mice sleep and EEG power spectra responses to IL-1β infusions 
were similar to WT controls (Fig 7).
3.4.1 Both NLRP3 KO mice and WT mice exhibit enhanced NREM sleep after 
ICV infusions of IL-1β—In both NLRP3 KO and WT mice, ICV infusions of IL-1β 
enhanced NREM sleep amounts in the first 6 h post-IL-1β compared to vehicle infusions 
[treatment: F (1, 38) = 11.119, p = 0.002; WT: 56.6 ± 14.4 min; NLRP3 KO: 66.3 ± 17.2 
min]. There were no significant differences observed between genotypes (Fig 7A). WT mice 
showed reductions in the frequency of NREM sleep episodes after IL-1β infusions [F (1, 19) 
= 8.119, p = 0.010; vehicle: 194.79 ± 21.61; post-IL-1β: 105.29 ± 9.82] and enhancement in 
the duration of NREM sleep episode bouts that produced the enhanced amount of NREM 
sleep [F (1, 19) = 95.260, p < 0.001; vehicle: 0.60 ± 0.05 min; post-IL-1β: 1.60 ± 0.10 min]. 
However, NLRP3 KO mice did not show any significant difference in NREM sleep episode 
frequencies or episode durations after IL-1β administration compared with that after the 
vehicle. During the first 6 h after administration no significant main effect was found for 
IL-1β altering REM sleep durations in either NLRP3 KO mice or WT controls compared 
with the responses to the vehicle (WT: 7.5 ± 2.7 min; NLRP3 KO: 0.5 ± 4.0 min) (Fig 7B), 
although WT mice exhibited a significant enhancement in REM sleep during the first 2 h 
post-IL-1β administration. IL-1β infusions induced a reduction in wakefulness in both 
NLRP3 KO and WT mice compared to vehicle infusions [treatment: F (1, 38) = 9.843, p = 
0.003; WT: -64.1 ± 14.3 min; NLRP3 KO: -66.9 ± 17.8 min] (Fig 7C). WT mice had 
reductions in the frequency of wake episodes after IL-1β treatments which, in part, 
contributed to the reductions in waking found after IL-1β infusions compared to the vehicle 
treatment [F (1, 19) = 7.862, p = 0.011; vehicle: 191.50 ± 21.61; post-IL-1β: 103.14 ± 8.58]. 
Nevertheless, NLRP3 KO mice did not show significant changes in waking episode 
frequencies or episode durations after IL-1β administration compared to with responses after 
the vehicle.
3.4.2 Both NLRP3 KO mice and WT mice exhibit enhanced NREM sleep EEG 
delta power after ICV infusions of IL-1β—IL-1β increased NREM sleep δ power 
spectra (0.5-4 Hz frequency range) in both NLRP3 KO and WT mice during the first 2 h 
after IL-1β treatment compared to the vehicle treatment [treatment: F (1,24) = 36.798, p < 
0.001] (Fig 7D), although there were no significant differences in NREM sleep δ power 
spectra detected between genotypes.
We further determined NREM sleep EEG power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) during 
the first 2 h after IL-1β treatment when NREM sleep δ power was elevated in both 
genotypes. NREM sleep EEG power spectra was enhanced in both WT and NLRP3 KO 
mice in responses to IL-1β infusions compared to the vehicle [treatment: F (1, 948) = 
120.133, p < 0.001] (Figs 7E and 7F). Several interactions were observed indicating that 
NLRP3 KO and WT genotypes responses to IL-1β differed within the power spectra 
analyzed yet were consistent with the NREM sleep δ power spectra findings [treatment × 
frequency interaction: F (78, 948) = 8.806, p < 0.001; frequency × genotype interaction; F

4 Discussion
Herein, we report a confluence of evidence that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a primary 
mechanism involved in spontaneous sleep and sleep responses after SD. NLRP3 KO mice 
exhibited less spontaneous NREM sleep during the light period vs. dark period and 
attenuated homeostatic sleep responses after SD. Greater values in the expression of the 
inflammasome-related components, IL-1β protein, and caspase-1 activity were found in the 
somatosensory cortex during times of higher sleep propensity in controls but not NLRP3 KO 
mice. Furthermore, NLRP3 KO mice demonstrated a lack of enhancement in NREM sleep 
responses to central infusions of the potent somnogenic bacterial component LPS indicating 
that NLRP3 inflammasomes, which are found in neurons and glia, further indicating NLRP3 
inflammasomes in sleep modulation (Walsh et al., 2014; Kawana et al., 2013; Gustin et al., 
2015). Moreover, sleep and EEG effects were enhanced in both NLRP3 KO and WT mice 
after ICV IL-1β infusions, suggesting that the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway is involved in 
sleep regulation, in part, through the activation of IL-1β in the brain. Collectively, these 
results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome is an important mechanism involved in sleep 
responses to sleep loss and components of pathogens in the brain (Fig 8).
Mice are nocturnal and typically demonstrate a diurnal pattern of NREM and REM sleep 
with greater amounts happening during the more sedentary light period compared to the 
more active dark period (Zielinski et al 2011). The literature indicates that greater amounts 
of sleep during the light period vs. dark period corresponds with increased cortical 
expression and protein levels of IL-1β in rodents (Krueger et al., 2010; Taishi et al., 2012), 
but this was lacking in NLRP3 KO mice. This suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome is 
involved in this cortical IL-1β and sleep pattern. Also supporting the involvement of the 
NLRP3 inflammasome in sleep regulation, rats given the caspase-1 inhibitor Ac-Tyr-Val-
Ala-Asp chloromethyl ketone centrally at the start of the light period experience reduced 
NREM sleep rebound (Imeri et al., 2006). Our results showing attenuated homeostatic 
NREM sleep responses after SD in NLRP3 KO mice further suggest that increased 
wakefulness promotes sleep through the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.
NLRP3 KO mice lacked increases in NLRP3 inflammasome-related molecular components 
within the somatosensory cortex during the beginning of the light period vs. dark period and 
after SD. Nevertheless, enhancements in the expression of ASC and caspase-1 are common 
to inflammasomes and cannot be excluded for their involvement in sleep-loss-mediated 
changes. However, that NLRPR3 KO mice did not show enhancements in these common 
inflammasome-related components after SD suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome is the 
primary contributing inflammasome. While the processing of IL-1β into its mature form can 
be accomplished by non-inflammasome-mediate mechanisms (Burm et al., 2015), NLRP3 
KO mice did not exhibit increased caspase-1 activity or IL-1β protein levels in the 
somatosensory cortex after SD as was found in the control mice. This suggests that the 
NLRP3 inflammasome is a primary mechanism in IL-1β mediated sleep regulation induced 
by increased wakefulness. However, IL-18, which was not investigated in this study, is also

 activated into its mature form by caspase-1 and can promote sleep (Elliott and Sutterwala, 
2015; Kubota et al., 2001). Therefore, IL-18 could also be involved in the observed 
attenuations in sleep responses to somnogenic stimuli we found in NLRP3 KO mice.
Our current findings that NLRP3 KO mice have attenuated NREM sleep and NREM sleep δ 
power spectra responses central administration of LPS suggests that these effects occur, in 
part, from the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, LPS can stimulate other 
pathways and molecules known to affect sleep, including nuclear factor-kappa B and tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (Zielinski et al., 2011). Interestingly, since enhanced sleep 
after infection can be beneficial in resolving infection (Besedovsky et al., 2012), our 
findings suggest that NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the cortex might have evolved as a 
regulatory pathway to enhance sleep to protect the host during brain infection. Differences 
likely exist, though, in sleep responses depending upon the pathogen component and the 
activation of non-canonical and canonical NLRP3 inflammasome pathways (Rivers-Auty 
and Brough, 2015). For example, LPS occurring from intracellular bacteria that reaches the 
cytosol of brain cells could potentially activate caspase 11 in mice or caspase 4 and 5 in 
humans providing an alternative conical inflammasome activation mechanism that enhances 
sleep in conditions such as meningitis.
NLRP3 inflammasome activation is complex and involves a multitude of mechanisms that 
are currently not well understood (Elliott and Sutterwala, 2015). The NLRP3 inflammasome 
appears to require a priming step for transcriptional activation such as the activation of a 
PRR, interleukin-1 receptor, or tumor necrosis factor receptor. In addition, a potential 
mechanism of activation by NLRP3 inflammasomes in the brain from sleep loss and LPS are 
from mitochondrial enhancement of cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). A growing 
literature suggests that mitochondrial pathways, the endoplasmic reticulum, and related 
components are largely required for inflammasome signaling. Indeed, evidence indicates 
that metabolism and mitochondria are altered after sleep loss and inflammatory-related 
conditions associated with disturbed sleep, such as sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease 
(Naidoo, 2012; Gileles-Hillel et al., 2016).
Energy-related systems such as ATP and adenosine are involved in the homeostatic sleep 
response (Dworak et al., 2010; 2011; Krueger et al., 2010; Brown et al., 2012; Porkka-
Heiskanen et al., 1997). Extracellular ATP increases in mouse basal forebrain following SD 
(Kalinchuk et al., 2015), whereas studies in rats showed that ATP primarily contained within 
the intracellular space decreases in brain areas including the frontal cortex, basal forebrain, 
cingulate cortex, and hippocampus following SD (Dworak et al., 2010, 2011). We note that 
LPS can also enhance the release of ATP into the extracellular space (Carta et al., 2015) and 
thus could potentially contribute to the activation of NLRP3-mediated sleep responses 
observed in the current study. Rats given purine type 2 analogs exhibit increased NREM 
sleep and NREM sleep δ power (Krueger et al. 2012), while opposing effects are found after 
either the P2R antagonists. Moreover, mice lacking the P2X7 receptor exhibit reduced 
NREM sleep and NREM sleep δ power spectra responses to SD (Krueger et al., 2010). The 
NLRP3 inflammasome appears to be activated by ATP-induced potassium (K+) efflux 
(Rivers-Auty and Brough, 2015), and high extracellular K+ pannexin 1 channel activates the 
inflammasome in neurons and astrocytes (Silverman et al., 2009). Animal KO studies and 
Zielinski et al.

 studies using cell slices suggest that potassium efflux modulates sleep and NREM sleep δ 
power (Douglas et al., 2007; Espinosa et al., 2004; Joho et al., 1999; Ding et al., 2016), 
which is in agreement with a role of the inflammasome in modulating sleep and NREM 
sleep δ power. Consequently, our findings and the literature support the idea that the NLRP3 
inflammasome could be activated by energy-related mechanisms.
The cerebral cortex projects to brain regions that modulate NREM sleep including the 
thalamus (Jones et al., 2009; Brown et al., 2012). NLRP3 activity in additional brain areas 
might provide important information regarding the mechanisms of how inflammation alters 
sleep for particular pathologies. Since NLRP3 inflammasomes are found in neurons, 
astrocytes, and microglia (Walsh et al., 2014; Kawana et al., 2013; Gustin et al., 2015), the 
activation of particular cell types expressing the NLRP3 inflammasome likely contributes to 
the different sleep phenotypes that are found after SD and LPS. Indeed, a recent study 
demonstrated that administration of systemic LPS to selectively inhibit IL-1 receptor 1 on 
neurons suppresses REM sleep and NREM sleep δ power spectra while and IL-1 receptor 1 
inhibition in astrocytes affects sleep fragmentation (Ingiosi and Opp, 2016). IL-1β effects on 
sleep, however, appear to be confined mostly to NREM sleep (Zielinski et al., 2011). The 
ambiguity of this effect is, in part, because of our current lack of understanding of precise 
mechanisms governing these two sleep states and their interaction.
Our findings indicate that NLRP3 KO mice exhibit similar diurnal differences in EEG power 
spectra as control mice with only small differences in particular frequency bands, but any 
physiological or behavioral effects of this are presently unclear. That NLRP3 KO mice had 
attenuated enhancements in NREM sleep δ power spectra after both SD and centrally given 
LPS suggest that these EEG effects are, in part, IL-1β-derived from NLRP3 inflammasome 
activation. SD can induce an attenuation in NREM sleep δ power spectra several hours after 
an initial enhancement and is referred to as a negative rebound in NREM sleep δ power 
(Rechtschaffen et al., 1999). The mechanism for this negative rebound is currently unknown. 
The lack of negative rebound in NREM sleep δ power observed in NLRP3 KO mice after 
SD could be compensatory due to the attenuated enhancement in NREM sleep δ power—a 
pattern that is similarly found in mice lacking both the IL-1 receptor 1 and TNF receptor 1 
(Baracchi and Opp, 2008). However, mice lacking only the IL-1 receptor 1 exhibit 
enhancements in NREM sleep δ power after SD suggesting that the negative rebound in 
NREM sleep δ power is related to molecules other than IL-1β (Schmidt and Wisor, 2012). 
Nevertheless, NLRP3 is an inducible complex whereas the aforementioned transgenic mice 
are constitutively lacking IL-1β which could contribute to these differences.
In conclusion, our novel findings implicate the NLRP3 inflammasome in modulating sleep 
and NREM sleep δ power induced by spontaneous wakefulness, SD and the bacterial 
component LPS within the brain. Evidence indicates that IL-1β expression is enhanced in 
the brain with the sleep disorder breathing condition of obstructive sleep apnea and 
inflammatory-related pathologies (Zielinski and Krueger, 2011). Because of this, it is 
plausible that inflammasome activation in the brain are involved. Furthermore, it is also 
possible that inflammasomes are activated in the periphery in inflammatory-related 
conditions and/or sleep loss to enhance pro-inflammatory molecules to alter sleep and 
NREM sleep δ power. Thus, the NLRP3 inflammasome appears to be an important

individuals with sleep-altering pathologies.

Sleep State (min/2 h time bin) and NREM Sleep δ power (0.5-4 Hz frequency range; 
percentage normalized to 24 h baseline) during baseline spontaneous sleep in WT and 
NLRP3 KO mice. Significantly greater amounts of NREM sleep (A) and REM sleep (B) 
were found during the light periods compared to the dark periods and vice versa for wake 
(C) and NREM sleep δ power (D) in both genotypes. NLRP3 KO mice exhibited 
significantly reduced NREM sleep during the light period (ZT 0-12) compared to KO mice, 
which occurred primarily in the beginning of the light period. N = 8 per genotype. Gray 
background indicates dark period (ZT 12-0). White background indicates light periods (ZT

Sleep state power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) during dark and light periods of 
baseline spontaneous sleep in WT and NLRP3 KO mice. WT and NLRP3 KO mice 
demonstrated significantly greater EEG power spectra during NREM sleep and wake dark 
periods compared to the light periods in both genotypes (A, B, E, F), although little 
difference was found in REM sleep EEG power spectra (C, D) between light and dark 
periods for either genotype. However, NLRP3 KO mice exhibited some diurnal differences 
in particular power spectra bands during these sleep states compared to KO mice [light 
period vs. dark period: F (1, 553) = 52.007, p < 0.001; light period vs. dark period × 
frequency interaction: F (78, 553) = 4.750, p < 0.001]. Post-hoc analysis indicated that WT 
mice had significantly greater NREM sleep EEG power spectra in the 1.25 Hz frequency 
bands during the dark period vs. the light period. NLRP3 KO mice also exhibited increases 
in NREM sleep EEG power spectra. Post-hoc analysis also revealed that EEG power spectra 
during wakefulness was greater in the 8.25-8.75 Hz frequency bands during the dark period 
vs. light period in WT mice. N = 8 per genotype. Bars and (*) indicates significant 
difference between genotypes for individual EEG power spectra. The Bonferroni corrected α

compared to the dark period (ZT 12)(A). Caspase-1 activity post-SD was also significantly 
enhanced in WT but not NLRP3 KO mice when compared to time-of-day matched controls 
(ZT (12)(A). Similarly, IL-1β protein levels were significantly greater during the light period 
(ZT 0) compared to the dark period (ZT 12) and post-SD compared to time-of-day matched

Sleep during SD and recovery sleep responses to SD. Both WT and NLRP3 mice exhibited 
significant reductions in (A) NREM and (B) REM sleep durations and enhanced (C) waking 
during the 6 hours of SD occurring prior to dark onset (ZT 6-12). WT mice but not NLRP3 
KO mice had significantly enhanced recovery sleep after SD during NREM and REM sleep 
states. WT mice also exhibited significantly enhanced NREM sleep δ power during the first 
2 hours post-SD (ZT 12-14) (D, E). WT and NLRP3 KO mice both exhibited significant 
enhancements in NREM sleep EEG power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) post-SD 
compared to baseline values, although post-hoc analysis only indicated that WT mice had 
enhancements in the 8.25, 13, and 16 Hz frequency bands. Significant reductions in NREM 
sleep δ power and NREM sleep EEG power spectra (0.5-20 Hz frequency range) 10-12 h 
post-SD (ZT 22-0)(i.e., negative rebound) (G) were found in WT mice, which was not found 
in NLRP3 KO mice (D, F, H). N = 8 per genotype. Bars and (*) indicate significant

 Fig 8. 
Schematic of proposed role of the non-conical NLRP3 inflammasome in neurons and glia in 
sleep regulation. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and pathogen associated 
molecular patterns (PAMPS) activate purine type 2 receptors (P2Rs) and pattern recognition 
receptors (PRRs) [e.g., Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)], 
respectively, to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome protein complex. Additionally, 
mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress likely play a role to activate the NLRP3 
inflammasome, in part, through reactive oxygen species (ROS). Upon priming by LPS, 
interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) or the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR), the NLRP3 
inflammasome complex forms with ASC [apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing 
a C-terminal caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)] to activate caspase-1, which cleaves the 
pro-forms of IL-1β and IL-18 into their mature active secreted forms to enhance sleep and 
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep δ power. Arrows indicate activation or 
enhancement.
