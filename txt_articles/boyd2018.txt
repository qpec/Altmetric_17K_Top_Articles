Contact with natural environments may be beneficial for various health and social outcomes but is often lower
among groups who could benefit the most. Using data from > 60,000 adults in England, we explored the spatial
(e.g. amount of local greenspace), individual (e.g. socio-economic status) and temporal (e.g. seasonality) pre-
dictors of infrequent contact and the reasons given for it. Replicating earlier, smaller studies, infrequent users
were more likely to be; female, older, in poor health, of lower socioeconomic status, of ethnic minority status,
live in relatively deprived areas with less neighbourhood greenspace and be further from the coast. Extending
previous findings, we also identified regional, seasonal and annual effects. Although response on issues of time
availability were important, being ‘not interested’ and ‘no particular reason’ were also common. Identifying the
predictors of these justifications (e.g. area deprivation was predictive of ‘not interested’, but individual socio-
economic status was predictive of ‘no particular reason’) sheds light on which demographic groups to engage in
specific interventions designed to inspire greater interest in, and contact with, the natural world to offer more
inclusive opportunities for positive experiences in nature.
1. Introduction
A growing body of evidence suggests that greater exposure to nat-
ural environments including urban parks, woodlands, nature reserves,
national parks and the coast (often referred to as green and blue spaces)
is associated with a range of positive health, wellbeing and social
outcomes (Allen & Balfour, 2014; Cox et al., 2017; Frumkin, 2002;
Hartig, Evans, Jamner, Davis, & Gärling, 2003; Hartig, Mitchell, de
Vries, & Frumkin, 2014; World Health Organization., 2017). Although
much of this evidence has been collected in highly developed urbanised
countries, evidence is also beginning to emerge of similar patterns in
the ‘Global South’ (Mukherjee et al., 2017). Despite these potential
benefits however, there is also evidence that large sections of the po-
pulation spend little or no time in these environments and are thus
potentially forgoing, or remaining excluded from, these benefits
(Dallimer et al., 2014; Kabisch, Qureshi, & Haase, 2015; Lee, Scott, &
Floyd, 2001; Lin, Fuller, Bush, Gaston, & Shanahan, 2014; Natural
England, 2015a; Roe, Aspinall, & Ward Thompson, 2016). For instance,
social groups found to rarely or never visit green/blue spaces for re-
creation include those living in deprived areas (Burt, Stewart, Preston,
& Costley, 2013; CABE Space., 2010), and are often the very groups
(e.g. lower income individuals) that may benefit the most from greater
contact with the natural environment (Mitchell & Popham 2008;
Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology, 2016; Wheeler, White,
Stahl-Timmins, & Depledge, 2012).
However, Hitchings (2013) has cogently argued that relatively little
research of any scale has been conducted into trying to better under-
stand why individuals in these groups, or individuals more widely, do
not use these spaces for recreation. For instance, he argues that al-
though there is a growing body of important qualitative evidence on
this topic (see below), quantitative work is more problematic because,
“many field studies of how people relate to urban green spaces observe
those found within them … [which] in terms of research pragmatics …
is easier than … calling in at their homes… [with] the feasibly very
different wishes and requirements of those who currently stay away
remain[ing] hidden from view” (p.99). The current research attempted
to partially address this gap by analysing the responses of a large
number of respondents who reported when interviewed at home that
they rarely if ever visited natural environments.
Specifically, we used six years of data from the Monitor of

 Engagement with the Natural Environment (MENE) survey in England.
We believe the MENE includes one of the most comprehensive, popu-
lation level data on the reasons for using or not using, the natural en-
vironment for recreational activities of any similar survey in the world.
This comprehensiveness allowed us to conduct richer statistical ana-
lyses than have been possible to date. For instance, we were able to use
multivariate statistical techniques to simultaneously explore a range of
spatial, individual and temporal factors which may help to characterise
those of do and those who do not visit natural environments for re-
creational purposes regularly and to better understand the reasons
given by infrequent visitors for not visiting more often.
We recognise that unlike the excellent body of rich, in-depth qua-
litative work in this area, our data are unable to explore the complex
interplay of factors affecting visit frequency and how they relate to
specific personal experiences or conditions. Nevertheless, by providing
a population level picture we see our findings as complementary to this
work by identifying patterns across population groups that are hard to
detect in small scale qualitative studies. We begin by briefly reviewing
some of the key reasons for infrequent visits to natural environments. In
an empirical paper such as this, our aim was to introduce readers to
some of the most important debates rather than conduct an exhaustive
review of the literature. Further, although various terms are used in the
field to describe the reasons people offer for not visiting nature, such as
‘barriers’ or ‘constraints’, these terms imply a latent desire to be in these
spaces which is thwarted. As demonstrated previously however (e.g.
Hitchings, 2010), this is not always the case and some individuals have
no desire to be in these spaces in the first place, and thus limited access
to them is neither a barrier nor a constraint. Consequently, we adopt the
more neutral term ‘reasons’ throughout. Nevertheless to the extent that
our results can detail on reasons why interested individuals do not visit
more frequently, results from a sample of this size may help policy
makers, practitioners and the research community identify, with more
certainty, specific issues facing particular groups and therefore be able
to instigate targeted interventions to support specific sectors of society
achieve the access they desire (e.g. Ambrose-Oji, 2009; Koppen, Sang, &
Tveit, 2014; Morris et al., 2011; O’Brien & Tabbush, 2005; Seaman,
Jones, & Ellaway, 2010).
1.1. Key reasons for not visiting nature explored in earlier studies
Poor proximity from an individual’s home or work is often cited as a
key reason for not incorporating routine visits to the natural environ-
ment in people’s day-to-day lives (Akpinar, 2016; Schipperijn et al.,
2010). Physical features such as road networks, challenging topography
and limited path networks may also limit the ability of willing visitors
to access these places (Barbosa et al. 2007; Dai 2011). Even where there
are well-connected path networks around and within local nature set-
tings, the condition of these paths may limit use for certain groups, such
as older adults with limited mobility or fear of falling (Sugiyama,
Thompson, & Alves, 2009). There is also good evidence that proximity
to natural spaces is related to income such that poorer areas are often
more distal, with access a particular challenge for parents with small
children, older adults and people living with impairment or disability
(Alves et al., 2008; Ambrose-Oji, 2009; Aspinall et al., 2010; Burt et al.,
2013; McCormack, Rock, Toohey, & Hignell, 2010). In other words,
issues of physical access are often greatest for those who can least afford
to circumvent them (e.g. travel costs) but who may gain particular
benefits.
Physical access may also intersect with safety concerns, with fear of
crime and physical and/or verbal abuse, often cited as potential reasons
for why people avoid public greenspaces. These fears may arise from
personal experiences, exposure to second-hand stories, anecdotes or
media influences (Morris et al., 2011; Skår, 2010). However, the issues
are not clear cut Ward Thompson, Aspinall, Bell, and Findlay (2005),
for example, highlight woodlands as a space in which teenagers feel
they can ‘reassert their independence’ in contrast to wider public space
which is generally perceived as ‘for adults’. For other users, however,
such as mothers with young children, young females or older adults,
teenage behaviour in these places can be intimidating, reducing the
frequency of visits (S. Bell, Thompson, & Travlou, 2003; Lloyd, Burden,
& Kiewa, 2008). In other words, one group’s demonstration of in-
dependence is another group’s source of safety concern. Incivilities
within settings that are poorly maintained, and high in litter, dog
fouling, dirty or unkempt areas, graffiti and vandalism can be inter-
preted as a sign of neglect, thereby undermining perceived safety
(McCormack et al., 2010; Tzoulas & James, 2010). There is evidence
these fear can be mitigated by a positive perception of social integration
in an area (Seaman et al., 2010).
These issues highlight that efforts to promote shared values around
access and use of the natural environment need to account for socio-
cultural diversity in how people perceive, value and incorporate natural
settings into their everyday lives and lifestyles (Cutts, Darby, Boone, &
Brewis, 2009; Kaczynski, Wilhelm Stanis, Hastmann, & Besenyi, 2011;
Özgüner, 2011). Visiting certain settings might not even occur to people
if nature-based recreation is not part of their cultural background or
where individuals have been subject to discrimination through their
different norms of use in the past (Byrne, 2012; Hong & Anderson,
2006). Morris et al. (2011), for instance, suggest that these ‘restricted
horizons’, i.e. limited awareness or knowledge of opportunities for ac-
cessing local nature, are particularly important among low income
groups, some of whom may lack experience of, or have limited con-
fidence in, negotiating large or complex natural sites (S. L. Bell,
Phoenix, Lovell, & Wheeler, 2014). Lin et al. (2014) support this, they
found that a person’s orientation towards nature has more of an effect
on visit frequency than the geographical location to a park.
Nonetheless, Morris and O’Brien (2011) argue that ‘facilitated ac-
cess’ initiatives can enhance the use of community woodlands amongst
less confident or excluded users. These initiatives emerged as an ef-
fective approach for enabling use amongst BAME (Black Asian and
Minority Ethnic) groups (especially women in these groups), older
adults (particularly those coping with recent bereavement) and those
with no previous experience of visiting woodlands. One aim is to pro-
vide support for those who express fears of getting lost due to a lack of
confidence or wayfinding knowledge within larger nature settings
(Ambrose-Oji, 2009). Such visits may also promote opportunities to
develop more ‘intuitive expertise’ of such environments, described by
Skår (2010) as ‘the accumulation and incorporation within the thinking
and skills of individuals’ (p.115), though this process can take time
(Finney & Rishbeth, 2006).
Socio-cultural factors affecting nature visit frequency can also be
experienced as a result of lifestyle norms and social expectations. For
instance, in an analysis of the 2013–2014 MENE data, ‘a lack of time’
was one of the most frequently mentioned reasons, yet the average
viewer in the UK watched over three hours of television per day in 2015
(Natural England, 2015a; Ofcom., 2017). This suggests a need to un-
derstand how and why people prioritise nature interaction within their
daily lives, given multiple and competing time pressures and interests.
Hitchings (2010) touched on this in the context of working practices in
London where employees were, for instance, reluctant to leave the
building during the day (e.g. to eat lunch in the park), for fear of
compromising productivity or focus (some did not even contemplate it
as an option). Similarly, S. L. Bell, Wheeler, and Phoenix (2017) note
the challenges of spending extended periods of time in nature in a
culture that prioritises speed and productivity over ‘slowness’ or re-
laxation.
1.2. The current research
The current research built on this literature in four key ways:
a) First, many previous studies into reasons for not engaging more with
natural environments, (Gidlow, Randall, Gillman, Smith, & Jones,
F. Boyd et al.
Landscape and Urban Planning 175 (2018) 102–113
103
 2016; Hitchings, 2010; Irvine, Warber, Devine-Wright, & Gaston,
2013; Windhorst & Williams, 2015), have used relatively small
samples, limiting generalisation. A key strength of the current work
is that it draws on a large national dataset that allows inferences to
be made at a national population level.
b) Second, developing on the previous descriptive summaries of the
MENE data in the policy literatures (Burt et al., 2013; Natural
England, 2015a), we conducted a series of multivariate regressions
which included a wide range of spatial, individual and temporal
factors in the same models. This allowed us to tease apart the re-
lative importance of predictive factors that tend to co-occur (e.g.
socioeconomic status and ethnicity).
c) Third, we imported spatial information about respondents’ neigh-
bourhoods (e.g.% greenspace) allowing us to explore access factors
that had not previously been investigated using the MENE data.
d) Finally, we were able to compare the predictors of a wide variety of
reasons given for not visiting nature including two that might be
amenable to intervention, namely ‘not interested’ and ‘no particular
reason’. If we could identify who is giving these kinds of responses,
we may be able to develop more targeted interventions to support a
greater interest in natural environments and a greater wish to visit,
and protect, them (e.g. Annerstedt & Wahrborg 2011; Bragg &
Atkins 2016).
In short, our aim was to build on the growing literature in-
vestigating the reasons people give for not engaging more frequently
with natural environments using a large representative sample of the
adult population of England. This enabled us to see not only how
widespread previously identified factors are across an entire country
but also provided us with the sample size to explore responses such as
‘no particular reason’ in greater depth than has been possible to date. To
the extent that these sorts of reason occur with any frequency results
would highlight the possibility that simply improving the quality of, or
access to, public green spaces in terms of landscape design may be in-
sufficient in encouraging diversity of access. Rather, a richer under-
standing of the values, cognitions and emotions experienced by diverse
populations is needed during the landscape design process to optimise
societal level benefits.
2. Method
2.1. Participants
Data were drawn from the first six waves (2009/2010 – 2015/2016)
of the MENE survey. Commissioned by Natural England, a government
body promoting public understanding, conservation and enjoyment of
the natural environment, it forms part of an in-home face-to-face om-
nibus survey conducted across the whole of England and throughout the
year to reduce potential geographical and seasonal biases (Natural
England., 2017). As part of the UK’s official statistics, significant effort
is put into ensuring the sample is as representative of the adult English
population as possible. Full details can be found in the annual Technical
Reports (e.g. Natural England, 2017) with key features including: a) “a
computerised sampling system which integrates the Post Office Address
(PAF) file with the 2001 Census small area data at output area level.
This enables replicated waves of multi-stage stratified samples”; b) “the
areas within each Standard Region are stratified into population density
bands and within band, in descending order by percentage of the po-
pulation in socio-economic Grade I and II.” c) “maximise the statistical
accuracy of the sampling, sequential waves of fieldwork are allocated
systematically across the sampling frame to ensure maximum geo-
graphical dispersion.”; d) “to ensure a balanced sample of adults within
the effective contacted addresses, a quota is set by sex (male, female
housewife, female non-housewife); within the female housewife quota,
presence of children and working status and within the male quota,
working status.”; and e) “the survey data is weighted to ensure that the
sample is representative of the UK population in terms of the standard
demographic characteristics” (p.5). Data and technical reports are
available
on
the
Natural

website:
https://www.gov.uk/
government/statistics/monitor-of-engagement-with-the-natural-
environment-2015-to-2016. Although some questions are asked weekly,
the questions most relevant to the current analysis, i.e. visit frequency
and reasons for not visiting, were only asked monthly, providing a total
sample of n = 63,890. Since justification for infrequent visits were only
asked of those who visited less than once a month, the sample for these
analyses were based on responses from 16,812 participants.
2.2. Visit frequency
Respondents were informed that they were going to be asked about
occasions when they had spent time ‘out of doors’, where “by out of
doors we mean open spaces in and around towns and cities, including: parks,
canals and nature areas; the coast and beaches; and the countryside in-
cluding farmland, woodland, hills and rivers. This could be anything from a
few minutes to all day long. It may include time spent close to your home or
workspace, further afield or while on holiday in England. However, this does
not include routine shopping trips or time spent in your own garden”
(Natural England, 2017 p. 11). The key question for current purposes
was: “thinking about the last 12 months, how often, on average, have you
spent your leisure time out of doors, away from your home?” (Natural
England, 2017 p. 44), with eight response options ranging from ‘more
than once a day’ to ‘never’. Interviewers were instructed to divide re-
spondents, based on their response to this question into two groups,
those who visited nature once a month or more (i.e. frequently) and
those who visited less than once a month (i.e. infrequently), with
subsequent questions determined by this categorisation. Our first ana-
lysis explored the predictors underlying this distinction (i.e. what fac-
tors predicted someone being a frequent vs. infrequent visitor).
2.3. Reasons for infrequent visits
Infrequent visitors, who visited less than once a month, were then
asked “why have you not spent more (any) of your time out of doors?”
Interviewers were instructed to code the open-ended responses into 23
different categories. Respondents could give multiple reasons therefore
16,812 respondents contributed a total of 22,019 reasons (Table 1).
Here we focused on six of the top eight reasons, all of which were re-
ported by more than 1,000 participants which we could loosely group
into: i.e. scheduling issues ‘too busy at work’ and ‘too busy at home’,
contextual issues ‘poor health’ and ‘poor weather’, and issues of pre-
ference ‘no particular reason’ and ‘not interested’. We decided not to
explore ‘old age’ and ‘a physical disability’ further in the current paper,
despite them being in the top eight. Preliminary analysis showed that
by far the strongest predictors of these reasons were ‘age’ and ‘disability
status’ respectively. Our decision to not include further analysis of these
issues here is not meant to suggest they are unimportant. Rather, fur-
ther analysis of the current data within the current space constraints
sheds little additional light on these factors beyond that already dis-
cussed in the literature.
2.4. Area level, spatial-geographical predictors
The MENE identifies respondents as residing in one of 32,482 small
neighbourhood areas in England called Lower-layer Super Output Areas
(LSOAs, average population c. 1500, mean size = 4 km2).
This enabled us to import data at the LSOA level from other sources
(e.g. Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, 2005) in order to characterise
an individual’s local neighbourhood in terms of: a) the percentage of
greenspace (stratified into five categories: 0–19.99% (ref); 20–39.99%;
40–59.99%, 60–79.99% and 80–100%); b) the distance of the popula-
tion-weighted centroid to the coast (Wheeler et al., 2012; dichotomised

as
0–5 km
vs. > 5 km (ref));

 deprivation (Department of Communities and Local Government,
2008), divided into five quintiles from most to least deprived (ref); and
d) broad geographical or ‘Government Office Region’ (GOR: nine ca-
tegories including London (ref), North East, South West etc.). With re-
spect to area deprivation the quintiles are based on data for all LSOAs
across England in terms of a combined ‘Total Deprivation Score’ derived
from seven different domains; 1) income deprivation, 2) employment
deprivation, 3) education, skill and training deprivation, 4) health de-
privation and disability, 5) crime, 6) barriers to housing and services,
and 7) living environment deprivation. For instance, barriers to housing
and services ‘relate[s] to the physical proximity of local services, and
‘wider barriers’ which includes issues relating to access to housing such
as affordability and homelessness’ and the crime domain refers to ‘the
risk of personal and material victimisation at local level’ (Department
for Communities and Local Government, 2015 p. 26–27). Previous
studies in the UK have shown that area deprivation, using this ap-
proach, moderates the degree to which proximity to natural environ-
ments (e.g. coast) is associated with self-reported health (e.g. Wheeler
et al., 2012). Due to missing LSOA data, subsequent regression analyses
were based on n = 61,512 for visit frequency, and n = 16,092 for
reasons for not visiting.
2.5. Individual predictors
Individual level predictors included gender (female, male(ref)); age
(young adulthood
16-34yrs (ref),
mid-adulthood
35-64yrs, older
adulthood 65 + yrs); socio-economic status (four categories from high
to low: AB (ref), C1, C2, DE); ethnicity (White British vs. other (ref));
employment status (full-time (ref), part time, retired, in education, not
working); marital status (married/cohabiting vs. single/widowed/di-
vorced (ref); long term illness/disability (yes vs. no (ref)); children
within the household (yes vs. no (ref)); car ownership (yes vs. no (ref));
and dog ownership (yes vs. no (ref)).
2.6. Temporal predictors
In the current work, temporal factors refer to the time of sampling,
rather than life-course. Temporal predictors included survey wave
(wave 1, March 2009 – February 2010 = ref) and the season in which

 the interview was conducted (winter = ref).
2.7. Analytical approach
Seven multivariate binary logistic regressions were used to estimate
the odds (and 95% confidence intervals, CIs) of: a) Being an infrequent
visitor to natural environments (i.e. < once a month); and b) reporting
the six reasons for this discussed above. Due to their large number,
many hundred LSOAs contained only a single respondent rendering
multi-level modelling with area modelled as a level one factor in-
appropriate. Analyses were conducted in SPSS version 23.
3. Results
The number of respondents categorised as infrequent (26%) vs.
frequent (74%) visitors within each geographical, individual and tem-
poral category is presented in Table 2. Nearly three-quarters of the
adult English population reported visiting natural environments at least
monthly. More crucially for the current paper, the odds of being an
infrequent visitor as a function of spatial, individual and temporal
factors are presented in Table 3. The odds are lower for individuals
living in areas with more greenspace (e.g. OR = 0.84 for greenest vs.
least green area), within 5 km of the coast (OR = 0.78 for 0–5 km
vs. > 5 km), in East England, North East, North West, South East and
South West (compared to London), but higher for areas of greater de-
privation (e.g. OR = 1.54 for most vs. least deprived). At an individual
level, females, older adults, those in lower SES status, those with a long-
term illness/disability and those with a car were all more likely to re-
port being infrequent visitors. Those of White British ethnicity (com-
pared to all other categories), all categories of employment (compared
to full-time employment), married/cohabiting individuals, those with
children in the household and dog owners were all less likely to report
being an infrequent visitor. Those interviewed in spring and autumn
were more likely to report being infrequent visitors than those in
winter, while after the first wave respondents were less likely to be
infrequent visitors. Approximately 16% of the variance in visit fre-
quency was accounted for by these predictors combined.
The key predictors of whether or not individuals reported time as a
restricting factor (both work and home) can also be seen in Table 3.
Although area level factors were relatively unimportant for reporting
these reasons, individuals in the West Midlands were significantly less
likely to report both types of time constraint than those in London.
Those in the East Midlands and North West were also less likely to
report being too busy at home than Londoners. Adults aged 65 years or
older, those in lower SES groups, those not in full-time employment and
those with an illness/disability were less likely to report being ‘too busy
at work’. People without a car and respondents in wave 4 (2012/13)
were also less likely to report this reason, while those interviewed in
summer and wave 6 (2014/2015) were more likely to report this as a
reason. In terms of being ‘too busy at home’, those in part-time
employment or education, married/cohabiting individuals and those
with children in the household were more likely to report this reason,
while those in the lowest SES category, White British respondents, those
with an illness/disability, and again those with a car, were less likely to
report this reason. Again, the odds of reporting this reason were higher
in summer (though also spring in this case) but lower in wave 4 (2012/
13).
Poor health was more likely to be reported as a reason by people
living close to the coast (perhaps reflecting the tendency in the UK for
older adults to retire to the coast, Depledge et al., 2017), and living in
the East of England, North East, South West, and Yorkshire/Humber
regions. It was also more likely to be reported by older adults, those in
the lowest SES group, those in part-time employment, retirement or not
working, those with a car, and those living with a long-term illness/
disability. Having children in the household was associated with lower
odds of reporting this reason.
Poor weather (Table 4) was more likely to be reported as a reason
by individuals living in the North West and North East (compared to
London), and also by those not in full-time employment, by married
individuals, those with children in the household and intriguingly, by
individuals in waves 4–6 (2012/13–2014/15). Those in greener
neighbourhoods were less likely to say that the weather restricted their
visits to the natural environment, as were those in the West Midlands,
those with a long-term illness/disability, those with a car, those with
dog, and those interviewed in spring, summer and autumn (compared
to winter) and in wave 3 (2011/12).
Perhaps some of the most interesting results concerned predictors of
those who stated either ‘not interested’ or ‘no particular reason’. The
odds of reporting ‘no particular reason’ were generally lower among
residents of greener areas and those living near the coast and in the
South West but higher among those in the East and West Midlands.
They were also higher among those in lower SES categories, not in full-
time employment and among respondents in summer and autumn, but
lower among females, older adults, those with a disability/illness, those
with a car and those in waves 5 and 6 (2013/14–2014/15). Although
there were some similarities in the predictors for ‘not interested’, there
were also some notable differences. Specifically, females, older adults
and those with a disability/illness were less likely to report being ‘not
interested’, while those not in full-time employment were, again, more
likely to report this reason. By contrast, area level greenspace, coastal
proximity and region (with the exception of lower odds for the North
East) were not important predictors, while regional deprivation
emerged as a relatively strong predictor, although individual level SES
and season were non-significant predictors. Moreover, in contrast to the
null effects for ‘no particular reason’, married/cohabiting individuals,
those with children in the household and those in wave 3 (2011/12)
were all less likely to report being ‘not interested’ while those in wave 6
(2014/15) were 1.54 times more likely to report this reason than those
in wave 1 (2009/10).
Finally, although the current set of predictors accounted for a re-
latively large amount of the variance in the odds of reporting being ‘too
busy at work’ and ‘poor health’ (52% and 41% respectively), they were
less effective at explaining being ‘too busy at home’ (14%), ‘poor
weather’ (8%), ‘no particular reason’ (11%) or ‘not interested’ (6.2%).
This suggests there are other dynamics that may be shaping these fac-
tors, which may be linked, for example, to life-course experiences and/
or broader socio-cultural influences on people’s sense of nature con-
nection and the extent to which time spent in nature can be prioritised
(S. L. Bell et al., 2014; Cleary, Fielding, Bell, Murray, & Roiko, 2017).
4. Discussion
The aim of the current study was to extend recent research into the
reasons people give for not visiting natural environments very often
(Ambrose-Oji, 2009; Koppen et al., 2014; Morris et al., 2011; O’Brien &
Tabbush, 2005), using results from a large English survey. As well as

 exploring the profiles of infrequent visitors, we investigated the spatial,
individual and temporal correlates of six of the most frequently stated
responses including time-related (work and home), contextual (poor
health and weather), and preference-based (not interested and no
particular reason) factors. On average, about a quarter of the popula-
tion were categorised as infrequent visitors to natural environments
(less than once a month), though the likelihood of being an infrequent
visitor did fall consistently over the six years of the study. This is
consistent with Natural England’s publication finding a ‘significant in-
crease in the proportion of the population who claimed to visit the
natural environment once a week’ (Hill, 2017). In support of previous
research into the physical factors for people visiting the natural en-
vironment (Gidlow & Ellis, 2011; Morris et al. 2011; Natural England
2015a), we also found that people with less local greenspace, and those
living in more deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to be cate-
gorised as infrequent visitors. The positive relationship between the
frequency of visiting the natural environment and the proximity of
people’s homes to the coast was a new insight, although previous work
has shown that people who live near the coast are more likely to make
more frequent coastal visits (White, Wheeler, Herbert, Alcock, &
Depledge, 2014).
Individual level predictors of being an infrequent visitor also largely
replicated previous findings, with gender, age, SES, ethnicity, employ-
ment, marital and health status all playing a role, alongside practical
considerations such as the presence of children in the household and car
and dog ownership (Irvine et al., 2013; Refshauge, Stigsdotter, & Cosco,
2012). Given that the survey question asked about visits in the last
12 months, season of interview should not theoretically play a role; that
it did should warn future researchers to take note of temporal factors
when asking these kinds of questions as people probably use heuristics
and more recent temporal horizons to assess longer-time frames. Al-
though we have no explanation for why people were more likely to
report being infrequent visitors when interviewed in spring or autumn
(compared to winter), at least controlling for season meant we could
have greater confidence in the results of the other predictors.
Results concerning the predictors of some of the main reasons for
not visiting natural environments more frequently were also in-
structive. Spatial factors, such as the amount of local green space and
neighbourhood deprivation, had little influence on time-related issues.
Instead, individual level factors (e.g. employment status and children)
were more commonly associated with a perceived lack of time. Given
the average amount of screen time (Ofcom, 2017; ONS., 2006), there is
a need for research to better understand the individual, social and
cultural factors that might be influencing people’s daily time alloca-
tions, e.g. screen time vs. nature time (or choosing screen nature over
actual nature). We recognise, however, that busy/demanding modern
lifestyles may reduce people’s perceived capacity to integrate visits to
natural environments within their routine and that the ready avail-
ability of in-home entertainment may be viewed as a ‘necessity’ rather
than a choice.
That poor weather was significantly less likely to be offered as a
reason for infrequent visits in greener neighbourhoods, among dog
owners and those with a long-term illness/disability was intriguing.
Further, that poor weather was not associated with SES at either the
area or individual level suggests that the expense of appropriate
clothing is not an issue, or it may point to the relative insignificance of
weather conditions in comparison to the other structural, social and/or
psychological challenges that such groups encounter in their lives on a
routine basis. That people were less likely to report poor weather as a
reason in all seasons except for winter suggests biases in people’s ability
to recall the last 12 months as a whole, rather than more recent time
frames. We are unsure why people not in full-time employment or those
living with a partner were also more likely to report weather as a
reason, and there seems to be a need for more in-depth qualitative work
to investigate these issues further.
That poor health was given as a reason for infrequent nature visits
by individuals living in several regions outside of London, reflects re-
gional inequalities in health (Marmot & Bell, 2012; ONS., 2015). This
reason was also more prevalent in coastal communities which reflects a
generally older, less healthy population at the English coast (Depledge
et al., 2017). The suggestion that poor health may compromise nature
visits highlights the need to understand and promote more inclusive,
engaging nature experiences that respect and cater for diverse health
conditions and contribute to quality of life despite such conditions. Thus
efforts to improve access, through the provision of accessible paths,
toilets, off-road scooters and site interpretation, should be accompanied
by more tailored initiatives designed to provide appropriate assistance.
Such support would need to facilitate people with illness or impairment
to negotiate these settings safely and in a way that promotes interest,
pleasure and meaning rather than exacerbating feelings of illness, im-
pairment, exclusion or disability. This type of support is often provided
by third sector organisations. In the UK context, examples include: a)
accessible rambling for people living with physical impairments (e.g.

 org); b) horticultural interventions for those with enduring mental
health conditions (e.g. http://www.sagesheffield.org.uk); and c) in-
clusive garden design (e.g. http://www.thrive.org.uk/). We recognise,
however that specialist schemes may not be able to support all in-
dividuals with an interest in experiencing nature despite poor health or
impairment; greater consideration is therefore needed regarding op-
portunities to better accommodate embodied diversity within more
widespread, mainstream green space interventions that aim to promote
population health and well-being.
Over 20% of infrequent visitors suggested they were either not in-
terested or had no particular reason. One possibility is that spending
time in nature is not a salient part of their cultural background, up-
bringing, daily lives or current practices, perhaps even ‘falling out’ of
the lives of earlier generations for reasons unbeknown to them. For
instance, before the end of segregation, some beaches in the US state of
Miami, were designated as for either “whites” or “blacks” with those
designated for Afro-Caribbean Americans often associated with higher
risk (e.g. strong currents). Consequently, parents avoided taking their
children to these locations and family norms to visit the beach for re-
creation became less well established (Hollenbeck, 2016). It will be
interesting to see how current efforts to increase people’s ‘connection to
nature’ in the UK affect the likelihood of reporting a lack of interest for
infrequently visiting nature in the coming years (Bradshaw, Stewart, &
Thomas, 2017; Hunt et al., 2017; Natural England, 2015b). Although
these two reasons may look similar, they had a different profile of
predictors; ‘not interested’ was associated with area level deprivation,
whilst ‘no particular reason’ was associated with individual level SES.
Tailored interventions that engage with communities living within
particularly disadvantaged areas may thus be valuable for increasing
interest, while interventions that work with people in particular types
of employment (the basis behind the SES categorisation used here) may
be more pertinent for generating meaningful opportunities to visit that
resonate with their specific life circumstances, wellbeing priorities and
needs. These findings could be integrated with future qualitative and
longitudinal work to explore these possibilities in greater detail, al-
though it should also be recognised that not wanting to engage with
nature is a perfectly reasonable choice and there is a need to respect
these preferences rather than assume people will become interested “if
only we show them how”.
4.1. Study limitations
Despite the representativeness of the overall survey for England, we
recognise several limitations. Firstly, this was an in-home interview and
thus had various demand characteristics. Since the survey is about
visiting the natural environment, social desirability bias may have en-
couraged people to report making more visits than they actually did. If
so, this would lead to an overestimation of the proportion of the po-
pulation who visit nature frequently. Moreover, the reasons these
people might have given for not visiting more often might have been
different from those who openly acknowledged infrequent visits, but
because the former group were not asked this question we have no data
on this. Indeed, it may be that the distribution of reasons for not visiting
more frequently than once a week differ from those explored here
(< monthly) and research could explore this issue using different
thresholds in future.
As already noted, asking people to recall visits over the last
12 months can lead to unreliable recall (Schwarz, Kahneman, & Xu,
2009). The evidence of a seasonal effect in the present findings supports
this suggestion, because there should be no seasonal effect if people
have recalled all 12 months accurately. In a survey as large as the MENE
it might be more sensible to ask about visits in the past four weeks (a
time frame considered to produce reasonably accurate answers for
many
health-related
surveys,
e.g.
General
Health
Questionnaire,
Goldberg & Hillier, 1979) and then explore seasonal effects by referring
to the interview date.
Due to space constraints we were unable to explore the less fre-
quently stated reasons. Many of these are potentially interesting ave-
nues for more in-depth exploration and interventions e.g. ‘This isn’t
something for me/people like me’ and ‘Don't like going on my own’. As
we wanted to explore the same large set of spatial, individual and
temporal factors in all regressions (to aid comparability of results), we
limited analyses to only six reasons stated by at least 1000 individuals
(> 6%). Although many reasons were not that common in the current
dataset, they could be applicable to many thousands of people nation-
wide. Similarly, further exploration of the influence of ethnicity was
considered, however there was limited data to allow for a robust sta-
tistical analysis (< 10% non-White British).
We also recognise that the spatial variables imported into the da-
taset (e.g. greenspace coverage and coastal proximity) were relatively
simplistic metrics; greenspace, for instance, was simply operationalised
as the percentage of local land cover designated as ‘greenspace’ and
there was no metric to account for the type, quality or accessibility from
people’s homes to any of this greenspace, despite all of these factors
being found to be important in previous work (Marselle, Irvine,
Lorenzo-Arribas, & Warber, 2015; Tyrväinen, Mäkinen, & Schipperijn,
2007). Similarly, the coastal measure was based on a straight-line dis-
tance to the coast from the population-weighted centroid of the local
area. Future work could build on this by calculating the road/path
network distance to key environments, such as the coast or woodlands
within the UK (Koppen et al., 2014), and more clearly differentiate
different types of coastal setting (e.g. managed, cliff/beach, urban/rural
etc.) as these have quite different visit profiles (e.g. Ambrose-Oji, 2009;
Elliott, White, Taylor, & Herbert, 2015). For instance, in Norway,
Koppen et al. (2014) mapped different recreational landscapes and used
network analyses to identify the accessibility for different populations
based on housing location. Demonstrating an approach that might be
useful more broadly for town planners, they recognised that different
user groups have different thresholds or critical travel distances which
affects their ability to engage with recreational landscapes and calcu-
lated actual distance rather than linear distance. On a related point, the
current data say little about the potentially poor quality of local
greenspaces, in terms of access, amenities, biodiversity etc., being a
factor in people not wanting to visit them and future surveys may want

 to include these kinds of consideration.
Finally, we also acknowledge that the current findings reflect the
recent situation among adults in England and we are uncertain how
well they generalise to populations in other countries, to children, or to
future generations. Similar work in other countries, preferably also
including children and longitudinal work over time, would help address
these shortcomings and broaden our understanding of these issues
globally.
4.2. Study implications
Although many of our findings replicate earlier work, a key strength
of our study is the large representative nature of the sample, which
offered several advantages. First it allowed us to observe annual trends,
identifying a year on year decrease in the total number of infrequent
visitors to the types of natural environments included in the survey.
This trend was far less visible in the raw data (Table 2) than in the
adjusted data (Table 3) and thus only emerged after controlling for a
range of other factors, representing a distinct advantage over previous
descriptive work (Natural England, 2015b). Second, it enabled us to
examine how frequently certain reasons are cited across the population
of England. Although previous work has identified similar reasons for
not visiting nature more often, it has been unclear how common these
are at the population level, and thus which issues to prioritise in current
and future intervention efforts. Third, and relatedly, being able to
conduct relatively extensive multivariate analyses helped us unpack the
relative importance of different factors previously identified simply as
“important”. For instance, two of the strongest predictors of being an
infrequent visitor, that were similar in size, were being in the lowest vs.
highest SES category (OR = 2.04) and having a long-term disability
(OR = 1.95). Both were considerably more important than, say, being
female (OR = 1.14) or living in the West Midlands (compared to
London, OR = 1.09), despite these also being significant.
In a situation of scarce resources, such insights might help decision-
makers focus and tailor their interventions within areas and amongst
populations where they could have the largest impact. For example,
living in the West Midlands was the strongest predictor (OR = 2.13) of
infrequent visitors citing ‘no particular reason’ for their lack of en-
gagement with the natural environment types included in the survey;
working with these communities to identify more appealing nature
experiences in their local area may therefore be effective in reducing
this reason in this location. Similarly, one of the strongest predictors of
feeling ‘too busy at home’ to engage with these natural environments
was having children in the household (OR = 1.33). Thus rather than
targeting a region (as with the ‘no particular’ reason), interventions
with respect to this reason might instead aim to work with parents of
young children to identify appropriate forms of support that would help
them to access local parks and other greenspaces in ways that could
potentially benefit both parents and children alike.
Given the tendency for many people to feel ‘too busy at work’ to
engage with nature, there is perhaps a need to facilitate the integration
of more time-efficient nature experiences into the working day, be it
through greening work commutes and offices (Haaland & van den
Bosch, 2015; Žlender & Ward Thompson, 2017), promoting a better
outdoor break culture within office environments (Hitchings, 2010), or
offering more virtual forms of nature ‘access’ within offices themselves,
promoting at least fleeting moments to tap into the more restorative
properties of nature within the workplace (Kaplan, 1993). Initiatives
such as the National Health Service Forest scheme in the UK (http://
nhsforest.org/), has seen tree planting increase value added to the areas
surrounding hospitals, providing an opportunity for staff as well as
patients to benefit from the greening of landscapes, also reflecting the
historic importance of hospital gardens (Thwaites, Helleur, & Simkins,
2005).
5. Concluding comments
To conclude, the present research compliments the growing body of
mainly qualitative work investigating who does and does not visit
natural environments for leisure and recreation and the reasons why
infrequent visitors say they do not visit more often. Although many of
the predictors and reasons will be familiar to those in the field, the large
sample size in the current analysis allowed us to explore the relative
importance of different spatial, individual and temporal factors in a
way that is seldom achievable, and to identify sub-groups for whom
specific reasons for not visiting nature more often are particularly
salient. Although designers of interventions to encourage greater con-
tact with natural environments need to be mindful of the limitations of
this self-report data, they could nonetheless look to the predictive
power of the different predictors of the different reasons in order to
identify groups who it might be most effective to engage in specific
tailored interventions.
