Hip fracture is the most severe bone fragility fracture among osteoporotic injuries. Family history 
is a known risk factor for fracture and now included among criteria for osteoporosis diagnosis 
and treatment; however, genetic factors underlying family history favoring fracture remain to be 
elucidated. Here we demonstrate that a missense SNP in the ALDH2 gene, rs671 (ALDH2*2), is 
significantly associated with hip fracture (odds ratio = 2.48, 95% confidence interval: 1.20–5.10, 
p = 0.021). The rs671 SNP was also significantly associated with osteoporosis development (odds 
ratio = 2.04, 95% confidence interval: 1.07–3.88, p = 0.040). For analysis we enrolled 92 hip fracture 
patients plus 48 control subjects without bone fragility fractures with higher than −2.5 SD bone mineral 
density. We also recruited 156 osteoporosis patients diagnosed as below −2.5 SD in terms of bone 
mineral density but without hip fracture. Association of rs671 with hip fracture and osteoporosis was 
significant even after adjustment for age and body mass index. Our results provide new insight into the 
pathogenesis of hip fracture.
Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by elevated risk of bone fragility fracture owing to reduced bone strength 
due to reduced bone mass, reduced bone quality or both1, 2. Aging is a great risk factor for osteoporosis develop-
ment, and thus the number of osteoporosis patients is continuously increasing as the number of elderly people 
increases in our aging society3. In osteoporotic bone fragility fractures, risk factors other than aging include low 
bone mineral density, estrogen or androgen deficiency, metabolic or inflammatory disease, prolonged steroid use 
or reported history of parents’ hip fracture(s). Some of these are now utilized as diagnostic criteria to prescribe 
drugs to prevent bone fragility fractures4–7. Although not currently included among criteria for intervention to 
prevent bone fragility fractures, current smoking, intake of a large amount of alcohol, mutations or single nucle-
otide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that encode the vitamin D receptor (VDR), estrogen receptor (ER), or 
low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), and low body weight/low body mass index (BMI) are 
considered risks for osteoporosis or development of bone fragility fractures8–11. In fact, several of these activities

are included in calculations of individual risk of fracture within ten years in the fracture risk assessment tool 
(FRAXTM)12. Presently, the FRAXTM score is included in criteria for drug interventions to prevent bone fragility 
fractures13, 14. However, specific gene mutations or SNPs associated with hip fracture are not included in these 
criteria.
Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) is a member of a family of enzymes that metabolize alcohol; ALDH2 
catalyzes conversion of acetaldehyde to acetic acid15, 16. Several ALDH2 gene SNPs have been identified: among 
them, rs671 is a missense mutation, and the resultant mutant ALDH2*2 protein acts in a loss of function or 
dominant negative fashion17–19. Thus, the ALDH2*2 enzymatic activity is severely altered even in heterozygous 
individuals carrying rs671 and is reportedly associated with conditions such as alcohol flush syndrome20, 21. The 
frequency of individuals carrying rs671 differs among human races and is highest in eastern Asia22. Serum acet-
aldehyde levels are relatively and significantly high an ALDH2*2 mouse model compared with control mice 
even under non-alcohol drinking conditions23, suggesting that ALDH2 functions in pathways other than alcohol 
metabolism. Indeed, rs671 is associated with diseases as varied as Alzheimer’s disease, esophageal cancer, osteo-
porosis, cardiovascular disease, gout and Parkinson’s disease24–30. In contrast, ALDH2*2 model mice reportedly 
show stress resistance in response to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury31. Aldh2-deficient mice exhibit normal 
bone mass but significantly reduced bone mineral density following alcohol consumption32 and increased cortical 
bone mineral density in the absence of drinking alcohol33. We previously reported that ALDH2*2 model mice 
exhibit significantly reduced bone mass relative to controls without alcohol consumption, although Aldh2 knock-
out mice show normal bone mass23. These results imply that the presence of ALDH2*2 is more potent in reducing 
bone mass than is ALDH2 deletion.
Here, we investigated rs671 association with hip fractures. Informed consent was provided by all subjects in 
the study, and 92 and 48 subjects were enrolled as hip fracture and control subjects, respectively. rs671 frequency 
in each group was assessed by direct sequencing. We report that rs671 is significantly associated with hip frac-
tures even after adjustment for age and body mass index (BMI). The odds ratio for hip fracture was 2.33 (95% 
confidence interval: 1.02–5.33) based on rs671. Our study suggests that ALDH2 rs671 is a possible risk factor for 
hip fracture.
Results
Research subject characteristics. 
We enrolled 427 postmenopausal women, who visited or were trans-
ported to hospitals and had undergone dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) or X-ray examination, for the study. 
Informed consent was obtained from all. Among them, 337, who were diagnosed as hip fracture or under −
2.5 SD 
BMD, were classified as the “osteoporosis group”
, and 90, who did not satisfy osteoporosis criteria, were chosen to 
represent the “normal group” (Fig. 1). Subjects with a history of or who had been treated for conditions affecting 
osteoporosis development, such as rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes mellitus, were excluded. In the normal group, 
subjects who had received osteoporosis medication and had no reliable past BMD data were also excluded. The 
remaining 248 and 48 subjects served as the osteoporosis and normal groups, respectively. In the former, 92 were 
hip fracture patients and 156 exhibited low BMD under −
2.5 SD and were diagnosed as osteoporosis patients. 
Figure 1. Flow chart of study subjects. Informed consent was obtained from 427 subjects, and 337 and 90 were 
diagnosed as osteoporosis and normal (non-osteoporosis) based on diagnostic criteria of either bone mineral 
density lower than a −
2.5 SD T-score or current hip fracture history. 89 and 42 subjects were excluded from 
osteoporosis and normal groups, respectively, due to incomplete datasets or a history of rheumatoid arthritis 
(RA), diabetic myelitis (DM) cancer, or corticosteroid use. Subjects taking osteoporosis drugs were excluded 
from the normal group. (a) The Osteoporosis group was defined by either lower than a −
2.5 SD T-score of BMD 
or hip fracture. No subjects had previous hip fracture history. (b) Cases (89) with history of or under treatment 
for conditions cited above were excluded. (c) Group includes 92 subjects diagnosed as osteoporosis with 
hip fracture. (d) Defined by a T-score greater than −
2.5 SD without fragility fracture (includes patients with 
osteopenia). (e) Cases (42) excluded based on criteria cited above.

Significant differences in age, height, body weight and BMI were observed between osteoporosis versus normal 
groups and between hip fracture versus normal groups (Tables 1 and 2).
Hip fracture subjects carry rs671 at higher frequency than do normal subjects. 
Next we under-
took direct sequence analysis to assess the presence of ALDH2 rs671 in study subjects. Subjects homozygous and 
heterozygous for rs671 were classified as ALDH2 mutation (+), and those with the normal gene were ALDH2 
mutation (−
). Of hip fracture subjects, 57.6% were ALDH2 mutation (+), and the odds ratio was 2.48, with a 95% 
confidence interval of 1.20–5.10 between hip fracture and normal groups (Fig. 2). Chi-square tests demonstrated 
that hip fracture was significantly more frequent in the ALDH2 mutation (+) than the (−
) group (Fig. 2).
Osteoporosis subjects carry rs671 at higher frequency than do normal subjects. 
Next, we ana-
lyzed rs671 frequency in osteoporosis and normal subjects and observed ALDH2 mutation (+) frequencies of 
52.8 and 35.4%, in osteoporosis and normal groups, respectively (Fig. 3), with an odds ratio of 2.04 and a 95% 
confidence interval of 1.07–3.88 between osteoporosis and normal groups (Fig. 3). Chi-square tests showed oste-
oporosis was significantly more frequent in the ALDH2 mutation (+) than in the (−
) group (Fig. 3).
rs671 is associated with hip fracture after adjustment for age and BMI. 
Age, weight and BMI are 
parameters associated with osteoporosis development and hip fracture11, 34, 35. However, we found that the rs671 
remained associated with development of either hip fracture or osteoporosis, even after adjustment for age; body 
weight; BMI; age and body weight; or age and BMI (Table 3 and Fig. 4). These results suggest that rs671 may rep-
resent a causative risk for hip fractures and osteoporosis.

Osteoblast differentiation is inhibited by acetaldehyde and rescued by anti-oxidant treat-
ment. 
The presence of the rs671 polymorphism is thought increase acetaldehyde concentrations in the 
bloodstream, which may interfere with osteoblastogenesis23. Indeed, serum acetaldehyde levels are reportedly 
significantly elevated in ALDH2*2 relative to control mice23. Thus, we evaluated the effects of acetaldehyde in 
osteoblastic MC3T3E1 cells (Fig. 5). The compound 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) is an aldehydic product of lipid 
peroxidation implicated in pathological changes associated with oxidative stress and is a key mediator of oxi-
dative stress-induced cellular responses36. We found that 4HNE levels, as determined by western blotting, were 
elevated in acetaldehyde-treated MC3T3E1 cells (Fig. 5a). Thus, we cultured MC3T3E1 cells with or without 
acetaldehyde in the presence or absence of the anti-oxidant Trolox C and analyzed potential effects on osteoblast 
differentiation (Fig. 5b). Osteoblastogenesis, as indicated by upregulation of the markers collagen, type I, alpha 
1 (Col1a1) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), was significantly inhibited by acetaldehyde (Fig. 5b). 
Acetaldehyde-dependent inhibition of Col1a1 but not Runx2 was rescued by Trolox C co-administration (Fig. 5b). 
However, expression of other osteoblastic markers, such as osterix (Sp7) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), was 
upregulated by acetaldehyde and downregulated by Trolox C (Fig. 5b). Although expression of osteoblastic mark-
ers in MC3T3E1 cells in the presence of acetaldehyde and Trolox C varied, formation of alizarin red-positive min-
eralized nodules induced by osteogenic medium was blocked by acetaldehyde treatment, an outcome reversed

and that inhibition can be reversed by Trolox C.

Osteoclast differentiation is inhibited by acetaldehyde and cannot be rescued by anti-oxidant 
treatment. 
Finally, we asked the effects of acetaldehyde on osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 6). 
Osteoclastogenesis induced by treatment of mouse bone marrow-derived osteoclast progenitors with macrophage 
colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL) was sig-
nificantly inhibited by acetaldehyde (Fig. 6a). Osteoclast differentiation, as evaluated by multi-nuclear tartrate 
resistance acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive cell formation and expression of the osteoclastic markers Cathepsin 
K, nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) and dendritic cell specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP), 
was significantly inhibited by acetaldehyde, but that inhibition was not reversed by Trolox C treatment (Fig. 6b).
Discussion
Hip fracture is one of the most typical and severe bone fragile fractures among osteoporotic injuries. Hip fractures 
disturb activities of daily living and are even associated with mortality37, 38. Hip fracture history is significantly 
associated with increased probability of additional fracture39. Thus, preventing the first fracture is crucial. Risk 
factors such as aging, osteoporosis diagnosed as either hip/vertebral fracture or low BMD, muscle weakness and 
dementia are reportedly associated with hip fractures35, 40–43. A family history of hip fracture is also criteria for 
drug therapy to treat osteoporosis patients, and “parental hip fracture” is asked in calculating future hip fracture 
risks by FRAXTM. Several SNPs are reportedly associated with hip fracture44. Here, we show that ALDH2 rs671 is 
a genetic factor associated with hip fractures, and that fracture risks more than double in its presence.
Interventions and treatments for osteoporosis can prevent hip fractures, and bisphosphonates, such as alen-
dronate and risedronate, or the neutralizing RANKL antibody denosumab reportedly block hip fractures relative 
to placebo controls45–47. Osteoporosis is, however, not the only cause of hip fracture, and other risks, which cannot 
be determined by BMD, such as risk of falls or poor bone quality, remain even after osteoporosis treatment. rs671

reportedly promotes low BMD in mice23 and is associated with human diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and 
esophageal cancer24, 26. Thus, rs671 may promote hip fracture via several mechanisms.
Tools available to predict fractures include FRAXTM, which can predict the probability of hip fractures within 
in the next decade. Hip fracture risk can be calculated by FRAXTM in the absence of BMD analysis by consider-
ing age, gender, BMI, alcohol consumption exceeding three units per day and parental history of hip fracture. 
However, treatment history for osteoporosis and other conditions associated with hip fracture, such as diabetes, 
are not included in the FRAXTM system. Significantly, rs671 can be detected by genetic analysis and is strongly 
associated with skin flushing upon drinking alcohol. We found that the sensitivity and specificity to determine 
rs671 by skin flushing upon drinking alcohol were approximately 80.0% and 92.3%, respectively, in our research 
subjects. Thus, rs671 can be predictable by such responses to alcohol.
ALDH2*2 mouse models exhibit osteoblastic dysfunction due to oxidative stress mediated by accumulated 
acetaldehyde levels in the absence of alcohol intake23. Consumption of more than three units of alcohol daily is 
reportedly associated with hip fracture9, and ALDH2 functions in alcohol metabolism by clearing acetaldehyde48. 
Thus, alcohol consumption is considered a confounding factor for rs671 in promoting hip fractures. However, no 
subjects in this study reported excessive alcohol consumption.
Osteoblastic apoptosis induced by acetaldehyde is reportedly effectively blocked by anti-oxidant treatment23. 
Here, we showed that osteoblastic differentiation was also inhibited by acetaldehyde and rescued in cultured cells 
by treatment with the anti-oxidant Trolox C. Similar to outcomes seen in osteoblasts, osteoclast differentiation 
was also significantly inhibited by acetaldehyde; however, that inhibition was not rescued by Trolox C. Since 
ALDH2*2 mice reportedly exhibit lower bone mass than controls23, inhibition of osteoblast function is consid-
ered dominant over changes in osteoclast formation in controlling bone mass under high acetaldehyde condi-
tions. Further studies are needed, but hip fracture risk as predicted by rs671 or excessive alcohol consumption 
may be prevented, at least in part, by administration of anti-oxidants without gene therapies for rs671.
Conclusion
We identified rs671 as potentially underlying, at least in part, a family history of hip fractures. The presence of 
rs671 increases hip fracture risk more than two-fold compared with non-rs671 carriers. The presence of rs671 can 
be predicted by responses to alcohol such as skin flushing. Those risks may possibly be reduced, in part, by an 
administration of anti-oxidant without genetic correction of rs671. Finally, combined evaluation of rs671, BMD 
and FRAXTM may provide a reliable index to predict hip fractures.
Methods
Subjects. 
This study was approved by an ethics committee at Keio University School of Medicine and carried 
out in accordance with guidelines approved by that committee. Informed consent was taken from all subjects 
prior to the study. All subjects underwent clinical and radiological examination by expert orthopedic surgeons. 
Subjects included 427 healthy postmenopausal Japanese women from five hospitals including our university 
hospital. Subjects with medical complications and/or who were under medical treatment known to alter bone 
metabolism were excluded from this study. The osteoporosis group (n = 248) was defined according to Japanese 
diagnostic criteria for primary osteoporosis49. The hip fracture group (n = 92), which was diagnosed with oste-
oporosis in the presence of hip fracture, was included in the osteoporosis group. Normal patients (n = 48) were 
defined by a T score greater than −
2.5 without fragility fractures.
Bone mass measurement. 
Lumbar spine BMD (anterior-posterior; L2-L4) and femoral neck BMD was 
measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Lunar Prodigy DXA scanner; GE Medical Systems, Madison, 
Wisconsin, USA) and expressed in grams per square centimeter. Participant positioning and scan analysis proce-
dures were standardized for all scans with CV < 0.01.
BMD was not measured in the hip fracture group (n = 92), a subgroup of the osteoporosis group, because the 
presence of hip fragility fracture met primary osteoporosis diagnostic criteria.
Polymorphism analysis. 
Polymorphisms were analyzed by direct sequencing. Briefly, PCR was performed 
using ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Co., Kyoto, Japan) with 5′
-TCCTGGGAGTGTAACCCATAAC-3′
 (for-
ward) and 5′
-CCCTGAAGTCTCTCCCTCTTCT-3′
 (reverse) primers. Amplified products were separated on a 
1% agarose gels and purified using QIAquick gel extraction kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After purification, 
sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with the for-
ward primer, and sequence was analyzed using the ABI310 system (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA). 
ALDH2* heterozygotes and homozygotes were included in the mutation+ group.
Osteoblast culture. 
Osteoblastic MC3T3E1 cells were cultured in alpha minimum essential medium con-
taining 10% fetal bovine serum (α
MEM) or in differentiation basal medium-osteogenic (osteogenic medium, 
Lonza, Tokyo, Japan) with or without 0.04% acetaldehyde (Wako Co. Ltd, Chuo-ku, Osaka, Japan) in the presence 
or absence of 40 µM Trolox C (Wako Co. Ltd) for 48 hours for realtime PCR and western blot or for seven days for 
alizarin red staining. RNA was extracted as described23, and osteoblastic differentiation was analyzed by realtime 
PCR for Col1a1, Runx2, ALP or Sp7/β
-actin using SYBR Premix ExTaq II reagent and a DICE Thermal cycler 
(Takara Bio Inc., Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan) using the primers below. Results are shown as means ± SD.

Osteoclast differentiation was assessed as described50. Briefly, bone marrow cells were 
isolated from C57BL/6 wild-type mice and cultured 72 h in MEM (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) containing 10% FBS 
(JRH Biosciences) and GlutaMax (Invitrogen Corp.) with M-CSF (50 ng/mL, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Co.). Then, 
M-CSF-dependent adherent cells were harvested and cultured in 96-well plates (1 ×
 105 cells per well) with 
M-CSF (50 ng/mL) and RANKL (25 ng/mL, PeproTech Ltd.) with or without 0.04% acetaldehyde and in the pres-
ence or absence of 40 µM Trolox C for five days. Cells were then subjected to TRAP staining and realtime PCR 
using the primers below.

Statistical analysis. 
Differences in age, height, body weight and BMI between hip fracture versus normal 
and osteoporosis versus normal groups were tested using a Mann-Whitney U-test. Logistic regression analysis 
was performed in the presence or absence of osteoporosis or hip fracture considered as a dependent variable, 
and gene polymorphism status, age, height, body weight, body mass index (BMI) as independent variables. The 
strength of an association between the polymorphism and hip fracture or osteoporosis was indicated by odds 
ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Data was also analyzed by the Chi-square test. An unpaired 
Student’s t-test was used to test differences in osteoblast differentiation, and significance was set at 0.05. All statis-
tical analyses were performed with EZR version 3.2.2 (Saitama Medical Center, Jichi Medical University, Saitama, 
Japan)52.
