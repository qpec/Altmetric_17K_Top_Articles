 Suicide is a worldwide health concern. According to the World
Health Organization (WHO), over 800 000 people die by suicide
every year.1 The most comprehensive review of available suicide
prevention strategies was published by Mann et al in 2005 and
updated by Zalsman et al in 2016.2,3 These reviews concluded that
restricting access to lethal means prevents suicide, and that
clozapine and lithium exert an anti-suicidal effect.2,3 However,
other reviews have drawn different conclusions about the role of
pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and psychosocial interventions
in suicide prevention.4–12 Notably, many of these reviews rely
heavily on observational data to formulate their opinions, and
their conclusions are largely based on improvements in inter-
mediary outcomes including suicidal ideation and attempts
(rather than death by suicide).4-12 These intermediate outcomes
are susceptible to measurement bias and may not predict
suicide.13 The WHO has emphasised the critical need to identify
interventions with proven efficacy for preventing death by
suicide.1 To address these concerns, we conducted a meta-analysis
of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of
various interventions versus control to prevent death by suicide
in adults. We believe our review will inform clinical practice and
illuminate promising areas in need of additional research, by
focusing on the hard outcome of death by suicide.14
Method
Review protocol
In preparation for our review, we drafted a study protocol
delineating our planned approach for identifying relevant studies.
We did not register our protocol with Prospero, but a copy is
available in online Appendix DS1. We used the standard
methodology outlined by Cochrane for our analysis and the
PRISMA guidelines for reporting our methods and findings.15,16
Eligibility criteria
We defined a priori inclusion criteria for this review. We limited
our review to RCTs and pooled results of RCTs published in the
English language. We required that studies randomly assign
patients to an intervention aimed at suicide prevention or a
control condition including usual care, placebo or wait-list. We
included studies in which patients were aged 18 years or older.
To broaden our search, we included studies if they reported death
by suicide as a primary or secondary outcome. In the event that
death by suicide was a secondary outcome, we required that the
primary study aim included the prevention of suicidal ideation
and/or behaviour. We included studies even if there were no
suicide events because this is a more conservative approach and
improves the generalisability of our findings.17
We included pooled analysis of RCTs in our review. Pooled
analyses, which use a systematic method to identify suicides in
drug trials (e.g. US Food and Drug Administration summary
basis of approval reports), may offer unique insights into the
relationship between suicide and psychiatric medications. Because
it is currently unclear which interventions prevent suicide, we
excluded RCTs that compared two or more active treatments.
Instead, we provided a qualitative summary of these trials in
online Appendix DS2.
We acknowledge
that
there are inherent challenges
in
using RCTs to study rare outcomes such as suicide and that
non-randomised, controlled studies may provide important
information about strategies to prevent suicide. We focused our
review on RCTs, however, because this study design is the gold
standard for establishing efficacy, and a sufficient number of RCTs
have explored suicide prevention.18
Study identification
We
searched
EMBASE,
Medline,
CINAHL,
the
Cochrane
Library, and PsycINFO from the inception of each database until
31 December 2015 to identify published articles addressing our
research question. We used exploded MeSH terms and key words
to generate the following themes: death by suicide, prevention/
control and treatment. We used ‘OR’ to combine prevention/
control and treatment. We then used the Boolean term ‘AND’ to

Background
Few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown
decreases in suicide.
Aims
To identify interventions for preventing suicide.
Method
We searched EMBASE and Medline from inception until
31 December 2015. We included RCTs comparing prevention
strategies with control. We pooled odds ratios (ORs) for
suicide using the Peto method.
Results
Among 8647 citations, 72 RCTs and 6 pooled analyses met
inclusion criteria. Three RCTs (n = 2028) found that the
World Health Organization (WHO) brief intervention and
contact (BIC) was associated with significantly lower odds
of suicide (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.09–0.42). Six RCTs (n = 1040)
of cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) for suicide prevention
and six RCTs of lithium (n = 619) yielded non-significant
findings (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.12–1.03 and OR = 0.23, 95%
CI 0.05–1.02, respectively).
Conclusions
The WHO BIC is a promising suicide prevention strategy.
No other intervention showed a statistically significant effect
in reducing suicide.
Declaration of interest
None.

 find the intersection between this collective theme and death by
suicide. We applied a highly sensitive search strategy to identify
RCTs in electronic databases. The details of the search strategy
are available in online Appendix DS1.
We attempted to locate additional published and unpublished
studies by searching ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to 31
December 2015 and reviewing the references of prior review
papers and included articles. When necessary, we contacted
investigators to determine whether an eligible study met our
inclusion criteria (online supplemental references35–43). In the
event that authors did not respond to our requests, we excluded
these studies (online supplemental references40–43).
Primary end-point and data abstraction
We defined death by suicide using the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) definition, ‘death caused by self-directed
injurious behavior with an intent to die as a result of the
behavior.’19
Based on a priori inclusion criteria, two reviewers (N.B.V.R.
and B.S.) screened the titles and abstracts of all potentially relevant
studies. The same reviewers then assessed the full text of the
remaining studies to make a final determination regarding
eligibility for review. In the event that it was unclear whether a
full text met all eligibility criteria, a separate reviewer (B.V.W.
independently
evaluated
these
texts
for
study
inclusion.
Discrepancies were resolved through consensus.
Using a piloted, standardised data collection form, two
reviewers (N.B.V.R. and B.S.) extracted data in duplicate from
included studies. We extracted data related to demographics,
methods, outcomes and risk of bias. We used the Cochrane
Risk of Bias Tool to assess study quality.20 In the case of
multiple reports of the same data-sets (online supplemental
references35,36,38,44–72), we selected the study that included the
most
comprehensive
and
up-to-date
information
(online
supplemental references36,60–65,67–72). From pooled analysis, we
extracted total number of suicides and person-years of exposure
(number of patients at risk multiplied by the number of years
of exposure). To minimise bias, we preferentially selected pooled
analyses that limited their analysis to the double-blind period
and reported person-year exposure. We reviewed pooled analysis
to ensure that trials were not double counted. Discrepancies were
resolved through consensus.
Data analysis
We evaluated our primary outcome using the Peto method and
calculated summary odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence
intervals and P-values.21 More commonly used meta-analysis
methods (e.g. risk ratio) are generally not recommended for the
evaluation of rare outcomes such as suicide.21–23 The Peto method
is a powerful alternative for combining data when event rates are
below 1%.21–23 We did not apply a continuity correction for trials
with zero events because this is not recommended with the Peto
method.17
We formed groups and subgroups of strategies using Mann
et al’s conceptual framework of suicide prevention–intervention
domains and sub-domains.2 Several interventions included in our
review were not described by Mann et al (i.e. non-cognitive–
behavioural therapy (CBT), case management, letter/telephone
contact after a suicide attempt, higher-level care interventions,
mood
stabilisers,
somatic
therapies
and
other
classes
of
antidepressants).2 Therefore, we used consensus among the
authors to develop additional domains and sub-domains to
categorise these interventions. Furthermore, we excluded two
domains reported in Mann et al’s review (screening for patients
at high risk, and media reporting guidelines for suicide), because
we found no related RCTs that met our inclusion criteria.2
To promote homogeneity, we stratified each of the inter-
vention domains based on the targeted population of interest
(e.g. patients with schizophrenia). For each domain, we evaluated
whether the intervention or control was favoured in each study
and we then determined whether these results were statistically
significant. We then evaluated the effect of combining these
studies on the magnitude, direction and statistical significance
of the overall summary estimate of the effect size.
We used the standard definition of an OR to interpret our
results (i.e. probability of an event occurring versus the probability
that the event will not occur in the intervention versus the
control). We deemed that an OR less than one meant that the
relative odds of death by suicide was smaller in the intervention
versus the control, and the opposite was true if the OR was greater
than one.24 We considered OR to be statistically significant if the
95% confidence interval did not cross one.
We used RevMan 5.3 to pool our results.25 We assessed
groupings for heterogeneity using Cochrane’s Q and the I 2
statistic.22 We used a conventional threshold of P50.10 and
I 2450% to indicate statistical significance and meaningful
heterogeneity, respectively.22
Confirmatory analysis
Many concerns have been raised about the validity of available
methods for conducting meta-analysis of rare events such as
suicide.26 To address these concerns, we felt that it was appropriate
to perform a confirmatory analysis. We used a Poisson regression
model with random effects and calculated an incidence rate ratio
(IRR)
for
suicides
over
person-year
for
each
domain
of
strategies. This approach accounts for differences in exposure time
across studies, addresses any potential heterogeneity between
trials and better accounts for trials with zero events.27,28 The
Poisson regression model with random intervention effects has
also been used in meta-analysis of rare event data, including
suicide.27,28 However, because the Poisson regression model is
not recommended if there is over-dispersion in the data, we first
performed a boundary likelihood-ratio test, evaluating whether
the alpha (the estimate of the dispersion parameter) for domains
(and sub-domains) of interest was significantly greater than
zero (defined as P50.05).29 If we encountered significant over-
dispersion, we calculated the IRR using the recommended
multilevel mixed-effects negative binomial regression rather than
the Poisson regression.30 Confirmatory analyses were conducted
using STATA statistical software version 14 (StataCorp).
Sensitivity analysis
We conducted a sensitivity analysis based on the quality of
included studies as judged by the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool.20
We evaluated whether the magnitude and direction of the
summary estimate of each intervention domain changed if we
excluded studies that were judged to be at high risk of bias.
Assessment of reporting bias
Using STATA, we generated funnel plots for domains that
included at least ten studies, and we assessed for publication bias
using Harbord’s modified test for small-study effects.31 This
method uses a modified linear regression analysis to identify
significant
funnel
plot
asymmetry
which
would
indicate
publication bias.31 The Harbord method is more powerful in cases

of few events per trial.31 We considered a P50.05 to suggest
publication bias.
Results
As shown in Fig. 1, we identified 8634 records eligible for screening.
After title and abstract screening, we found that 351 records
remained, and 97 reports (78 studies) met inclusion criteria based
on full text review (online supplemental references36,60–65,67–137).
Characteristics of included studies
Tables 1–3 display the characteristics of included studies, which
spanned five decades. Over 50% were published in the past 10
years. Although most trials studied interventions targeted at
individuals with known risk factors for suicide, some trials
evaluated interventions in a general or primary care population.
For example, one trial investigated a central storage facility for
pesticides in villages practising floriculture in Southern India
(online supplemental reference94). Except for one trial that
used a wait-list control and one trial that used sham (online
supplemental references96,136), all trials of non-pharmacological
interventions used a usual care comparison. Pharmacological
studies used pill placebo as a control group.
Assessment of quality
We identified a number of methodological concerns (online Table
DS1). All studies were of randomised design, but many trials had
small sample sizes, large losses to follow-up, and/or were of short
duration. For non-pharmacological studies, it was difficult to
mask patients/personnel, and the usual care arm was not
standardised across studies. Some authors raised concerns about
the fidelity of the intervention. Several authors suggested that
patients in the usual care arm may have benefited from study
assessments, and these benefits may have obscured the true effect
of the intervention. Finally, although many trials used robust
methods to identify suicide, several trials relied on methods that
were either unclear or at high risk for bias, which may have
resulted in over- or underestimation of the true effect of the
intervention. For example, Sun et al used informants (caregivers)
to report suicide and suicidal behaviour, but raised concerns that
information may have been withheld owing to the stigma of
suicide (online supplemental references65).
Analysis of heterogeneity
As shown in online Fig. DS1, we encountered little heterogeneity
in our analysis, except there was modest heterogeneity when we
evaluated intensive follow-up interventions (Q = 7.17 (P = 0.05),
I 2 = 48%). This reflects the distinct differences between the types
of interventions tested. Reassuringly, the heterogeneity resolved
when we categorised these interventions into three sub-domains.
Effects of complex psychosocial interventions
Twenty-nine RCTs (n = 22 135) reported on complex psychosocial
interventions (online supplemental references36,60–65,73–94). In the
three trials of the WHO brief intervention and contact (BIC)
intervention, 3 out of 1041 patients in the intervention group
and 24 out of 987 patients in the control group died by suicide,
and the difference was significant (OR = 0.20, 95% CI 0.09–0.42,
P50.0001; IRR not calculable owing to insufficient number of
studies) (Fig. 2) (online supplemental references60,73–74). The
WHO BIC was tested in low- and middle-income countries as part
of the Multisite Intervention Study on Suicidal Behaviours. The
intervention
included
an
educational
session
on
suicide
prevention followed by regular contact with a trained provider (by
telephone or in person) for up to 18 months (online supplemental
references60,73,74). There was no evidence that other complex
psychosocial interventions reduce the risk of suicide (online
Fig. DS1 and online Table DS2).
Effects of psychotherapy
There were 24 unique RCTs (n = 3056) of psychotherapies to
address suicidal behaviour (online supplemental references67,68,
95–116). In six trials of CBT for suicide prevention, 3 out of 514
patients in the intervention group and 10 out of 526 patients in
the control group died by suicide (Fig. 2). The results, however,
were not statistically significant (OR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.12–1.03,
P = 0.06;
IRR = 0.30,
95%
CI
0.08–1.11,
P= 0.07)
(online
supplemental
references67,95–99).
Common
features
of
the
intervention included reviewing a recent suicide attempt, applying
cognitive strategies and learning relapse prevention. There was no
evidence that other CBT or non-CBT therapies reduce the risk of
suicide (online Fig. DS1 and online Table DS2).
Effects of pharmacotherapy
There were 14 RCTs (n = 2443) reporting on pharmacotherapy
and death by suicide (online supplemental references117–130). After
accounting for random effects and length of follow-up, there was
no evidence among the pooled trials that pharmacotherapy reduced
the risk of suicide (OR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.05–0.86; IRR = 0.10, 95%
CI 0.00–32.27) (online Fig. DS1 and online Table DS2). In 6 trials

of lithium, 1 out of 313 patients in the intervention group and
6 out of 306 patients in the control group died by suicide. The
results, however, were not statistically significant (OR = 0.23, 95%
CI 0.05–1.02, P= 0.05; IRR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.00–9.41, P40.1)
(online Fig. 2 and online Table DS2) (online supplemental
references117–122). Several trials tested lithium in patients with
depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviour (Fig. 2). With the
exception of one trial that evaluated low-dose lithium (300 mg/
day) (online supplemental references120), trials were designed to
reach a target therapeutic lithium level (online supplemental
references117–119,121,122). We identified no placebo-controlled trials
of clozapine for suicide prevention.
A large amount of data were included in pooled analyses
(6 trials, 23 016 person-years) to evaluate pharmacotherapy. The
overall
summary
estimate
yielded
non-significant
results
(IRR = 1.15, 95% CI 0.56–2.39, P40.10) (online supplemental
references70–72,131–133), and there was insufficient granularity to
compare specific pharmacotherapy agents.
Other interventions
We found no evidence that higher-level care interventions such as
partial hospital admission (2 trials, n= 432; OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.07–
1.86, P40.10) (online supplemental references69,134,135) or somatic
therapies such as electroconvulsive therapy (2 trials, n= 92;
OR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.00–6.82, P40.10) (online supplemental refer-
ences136,137) reduce the risk of suicide (online Fig. DS1). There were
too few studies available to calculate an IRR for these interventions.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis in which we excluded trials
that had one or more high risk for bias based on the Cochrane

Forest plots of the odds of suicide with three different targeted interventions to prevent suicide v. control condition.
MDD, major depressive disorder; OPAC, outreach, problem solving, adherence and continuity; SI, suicidal ideation; w2, Cochrane’s Q; WHO BIC, World Health Organization brief
intervention and contact programme.
a. Programmes included: WHO BIC (educational intervention plus telephone or face-to-face contact with providers trained in suicide prevention), OPAC (a nurse specialising in
suicide prevention was assigned to follow the patient throughout the course of the intervention), and OSTA (regular telephone and letter contact with patient plus interprofessional
collaboration). Study duration ranged from 12 to 18 months.
b. Patients received between 5 and 12 sessions of the therapy intervention.
c. The study duration ranged from 1 month to 24 months.
d. The odds ratio has a skewed distribution. Although the lower end of the odds ratio is bounded by zero (an odds ratio cannot be negative), the upper end can reach infinity
(online supplemental reference139).
 Strategies to prevent death by suicide
Risk of Bias Tool (online supplemental references63–65,67,69,71,72,75–82,
84,86,88–91,93,94,96,97,99,101,104–108,110–114,116,118,119,134,137) (online Table
DS1). This did not change our results in a substantial way, except
for our analysis of lithium trials. The results of the summary
estimate for lithium became statistically significant after removing a
more recent study (online supplemental references118) with several
methodological limitations (5 trials; OR= 0.13, 95% CI 0.03–0.66,
P = 0.01, test of heterogeneity P = 1.00 (Q = 0.01, I 2 = 0%)).
Reporting bias
We did not find any evidence to suggest publication bias among
complex psychosocial interventions, psychotherapy, intensive
follow-up strategies or CBT (Harbord’s modified test for small-study
effects; P = 0.20, P = 0.47, P= 0.57 and P = 0.71, respectively). We
were unable to formally assess for publication bias among the
remaining domains and sub-domains (as domains included
fewer than ten studies or most of the studies in the domain
reported no events).
Discussion
Summary of main results
The amount of research on suicide prevention, and specifically the
number of RCTs targeting suicide, has increased substantially over
the past decade. We located 56 RCTs of suicide prevention
strategies in adults that have been published since Mann et al’s
review.2 This suggests that more research using RCT methodology
is being done in the area of suicide prevention. Although most
interventions did not lead to a significant reduction in suicide,
we did find that the WHO’s BIC intervention was associated with
significantly lower odds of death by suicide. Although trials of
lithium and CBT for suicide prevention showed fewer deaths by
suicide among the intervention groups than the controls, we were
unable to draw any definitive conclusions, as the confidence
interval for the summary estimates spanned no difference. Trials
had several limitations. Most lithium trials had small sample sizes
(585 patients) and trials of CBT for suicide prevention were
generally of short duration (median 10.5 months). It is also worth
noting that the WHO’s BIC intervention may not be generalisable
to high-income countries, and that lithium was only studied in
patients with unipolar and bipolar depression.
Comparison with other studies
As with a meta-analysis of findings from the most recent
Cochrane review of psychosocial interventions for self-harm, we
found that CBT-based therapies were associated with lower odds
of suicide, but the results were not significant.8 Because these
authors did not perform a subgroup analysis, we cannot compare
our results for CBT for suicide prevention.8 Other reviews, how-
ever, have suggested that CBT for suicide prevention may prevent
suicidal behaviour in high-risk populations.2,4 Unlike prior
reviews, we found no evidence that problem-solving therapy or
dialectical behaviour therapy reduce the risk of suicide.2,3 Our
differing conclusions may reflect our focus on suicide deaths,
rather than on intermediary outcomes.
Consistent with others, we found that most psychosocial
interventions were ineffective,2,3 but we differed from Milner
et al 6 in that we found no evidence to support letter/telephone-
driven interventions. We believe the divergence in our results may
reflect our decision to evaluate postcard/telephone interventions
and intensive follow-up strategies separately.6 Furthermore, unlike
Mann et al 2 and Zalsman et al,3 we felt that there was strong
evidence that the WHO BIC programme was associated with
significantly lower odds of suicide. Our divergent conclusions
may reflect our inclusion of two additional RCTs and our focus
on death by suicide rather than on intermediary outcomes.2,3
Recently, Inagaki et al also reported that intensive follow-up
significantly reduced suicides.7 These authors, however, did not
specifically evaluate the WHO BIC programme.7
Akin to our results, a Cochrane review concluded that there is
an insufficient number of high-quality trials available to draw any
firm conclusions about the role of medications in patients who
self-harm.5 Although Zalsman et al reported that antidepressants
reduced the risk of suicide in adults,3 we did not replicate this
finding. The majority of RCTs of antidepressants included in
our review reported no suicides. In addition, unlike previous
reviews,2,3 we did not find that lithium significantly reduced
suicide. This may be explained by our inclusion of a recent RCT
with
negative
findings
(online
supplemental
reference118).
Furthermore, although Mann et al 2 and Zalsman et al 3 concluded
that clozapine has an anti-suicidal effect, we did not replicate this
finding. This difference may reflect our decision to limit our
review to placebo-controlled trials. We located no placebo-
controlled trials of clozapine for suicide prevention. We also
focused our review on suicide deaths, rather than on intermediary
outcomes. Furthermore, prior reviews have relied heavily on the
results of the InterSePT study to support clozapine’s anti-suicidal
effect (online supplemental reference138).2 We excluded the
InterSePT study because clozapine was compared with olanzapine
(online supplemental reference138) rather than placebo. It is
notable, however, that the InterSePT study reported a higher
number of suicide deaths in the clozapine arm versus olanzapine,
although the results were not significant (online supplemental
reference138). Others have also raised concerns about the lack of
strong evidence to support clozapine’s anti-suicidal effect.32,33
Although many reviews stress the role of restricting access to
lethal methods in suicide prevention,2,3 we were unable to
systematically study this type of intervention because only one
study met our inclusion criteria. Restricting access to lethal means
such as gun control is not easily tested under randomised
conditions, although a plethora of observational data have
demonstrated that restricting access to lethal means can prevent
suicide.2,3 Finally, Zalsman et al concluded that other strategies
such as screening programmes and media education required
more testing.3 We were unable to assess these strategies because
no studies met our inclusion criteria.
Meaning and implications of the review
The WHO BIC intervention was associated with significantly
lower odds of suicide, but it will be important to test this strategy
in other populations. Although the summary estimates for CBT
for suicide prevention and lithium showed fewer deaths by suicide
among the intervention group than the control group, the results
were not statistically significant. Therefore, we believe our results
should be interpreted with caution.34 Our findings do not suggest
that lithium or CBT for suicide prevention cause harm, but they
also do not provide clear evidence of effectiveness. Our findings
suggest the need for further study of these interventions.
Strengths and weaknesses of the review
We performed a rigorous search of the literature and did not
exclude studies based on quality or relevance. This has been a
criticism of the Zalsman review.35 Although our focus on death
by suicide can be viewed as a strength,14,35 it is also a potential
limitation.13 RCTs offer the best evidence, but there are inherent
limitations in developing and testing targeted interventions to
address rare events such as suicide in the context of an RCT.13,18
Many studies were at risk for bias in their assessment of suicide,
401
 Riblet et al
and this may have obscured the true effect. Furthermore, for many
interventions there were insufficient data (i.e. limited number of
trials and/or small sample sizes) to draw any definitive conclusions
about their efficacy. In addition, owing to the small sample sizes,
we had poor precision around the summary estimate of the effect
size, further limiting our evaluation of these interventions. Since
our analysis did not include patient-level data, we were unable
to explore potential moderators or mediators of the efficacy of
suicide prevention interventions. Peto ORs can also yield biased
results when there are substantial differences in study arm sizes.
Reassuringly, the comparator arms of included RCTs were well
balanced. We did not calculate Peto ORs for pooled analysis
because of large differences in study arms. Finally, although many
novel approaches to suicide prevention (e.g. ketamine) are
emerging, no studies of these met our full inclusion criteria.
Overall, our review suggests that the WHO BIC intervention is
associated with significantly lower odds of suicide. Although trials
of CBT for suicide prevention and lithium showed fewer deaths by
suicide among the intervention groups than the controls, the
differences were not statistically significant. Available studies also
have several limitations that may threaten their internal and
external validity. More research is needed to evaluate the efficacy
of these and other interventions in a range of settings.
