Background: Diabetes in cats resembles type 2 diabetes in people. The etiology is not fully understood, but both genetic
and environmental factors are believed to contribute.
Objectives: To assess the associations of environmental risk factors with diabetes in cats.
Animals: Cats with a diagnosis of diabetes (n = 396) insured by a Swedish insurance company during years 2009–2013,
and a control group (n = 1,670) matched on birth year.
Methods: A web-based questionnaire was used in a case–control study. An invitation to participate was sent to owners of
1,369 diabetic cats and 5,363 control cats. The survey contained questions related to the cat’s breed, age, sex, neutering
status, body condition, housing, access to the outdoors, activity level, diet, eating behavior, feeding routine, general health,
stressful events, other pets in the household, medications, and vaccination status. Data were analyzed by multiple logistic
regression.
Results: Response rate was 35% for the diabetic group and 32% for the control group. Indoor confinement, being a
greedy eater, and being overweight were associated with an increased risk of diabetes. In cats assessed by owners as being
normal weight, there was an association between eating predominantly dry food and an increased risk of diabetes (Odds ratio
3.8; 95% confidence intervals 1.3–11.2).
Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Dry food is commonly fed to cats worldwide. The association found between dry
food and an increased risk of diabetes in cats assessed as normal weight by owners warrants further attention.

iabetes mellitus (DM) in cats has an incidence of
11.6 cases per 10,000 cat-years at risk.1 Most cats
suffer from a type of DM similar to type 2 diabetes
(T2DM) in people, characterized by a relative deficiency
of insulin secretion combined with insulin resistance, in
contrast to the primary beta-cell deficiency of type 1
diabetes. Similarities between type 2 diabetes in cats
and people include common risk factors, such as obe-
sity, age, and physical inactivity, as well as similar
pathophysiological
findings,
including
deposition
of
amyloid in islets.2–6 Other risk factors associated with
increased risk of DM in cats include male sex, neuter-
ing, indoor confinement, and treatment with certain
drugs.1,3,6,7
Obesity is a growing global health problem,8 also for
many cats, which often spend their lives as indoor pets,
are fed commercial diets, often in abundancy, with
overweight
as
a
common
consequence.9
Obesity,
together with physical inactivity, are believed to be the
main contributors to the insulin resistance associated
with diabetes in both cats and people.5
There are many studies on environmental risk factors
for T2DM in people, but studies on the cat population
are scarcer.3 Better knowledge on predisposing factors
for feline DM is important to identify individuals at
risk at an earlier stage and subsequently have a better
possibility to prevent development of disease. The main
aim of this study was to investigate the associations
between DM in cats and environmental risk factors. We
have previously reported on demographic risk factors
for DM in Swedish cats, using data from the same
insurance register.1
Materials and Methods
Study Population
All cats insured in Agria Pet Insurancea at any time point dur-
ing 2009–2013 were eligible for inclusion in the study. DM cases
(n = 1,369) were identified based on 4 diagnostic codes (DM, DM
without complication, DM with complication, and DM with
ketoacidosis). When an insurance claim is made, a diagnosis is
assigned by the attending veterinarian, based on a standardized
system with approximately 8,000 diagnostic codes.10 The control
group (n = 5,363) was recruited from the same database and time
period, and control cats were matched on birth year with the
diabetic cats. An invitation to participate in the study including a

 web address to the questionnaire was sent out to all cat owners by
mail. Owners were briefly informed in the invitation letter that an
extra set of questions would be provided if their cat had at some
time point been diagnosed with diabetes.
Questionnaire
The web-based questionnaire (in Swedish) was available during
a 4-month period through an online survey providerb, and con-
tained 48 questions. Questions included information about the age
and sex of the respondent, number of adults in the household, the
presence of children (<18 years) in the household, and the habitat,
as well as questions on the cat’s birth year, breed, sex, and neuter-
ing status. Owners were asked if their cat was still alive, and if it
was not, the cause and year of death. A positive answer to the
question “Has your cat ever been diagnosed with diabetes?” was
used to verify case status. All questions on potential environmental
risk factors referred to the year preceding a diagnosis of DM, or
to the last year of the cat’s life for controls. Owners were asked
about the cat’s general health, treatment with progestins or corti-
costeroids, vaccination status, type of diet, feeding regime, eating
behavior, body condition, number of cats in the household, pres-
ence of other animals in the household, possibly major stressful
events, activity level, and about indoor confinement or whether
the cat had access to the outdoors. Respondents were given several
answering options per question, including the alternative “I wish
not to answer this question/I do not know,” as well as space for
free-text answers. For example, the question about the cat’s eating
behavior offered 5 different answering options: (1) greedy (finishes
meals immediately); (2) finishes meals within hours; (3) nibbles
several times daily; (4) picky (leaves food often); and (5) Other/I
do not know. Answers were mandatory to proceed through the
survey, and most often with only one possible answer. It was pos-
sible for respondents to return to previous questions and change
their answers. Depending on the answer, some questions led the
respondents to a set of extra questions. Questions on type of diet
and medications allowed several answers. For diet, owners were
asked to give only one answer if the cat’s diet consisted mainly of
1 type of food (≥75%), and 2 answers if the cat ate approximately
50% of each type of food. It was not possible to give more than 2
answers to this question. Medications asked for were previous use
of progestins and corticosteroids.
Data Analysis
All answers from the questionnaire were thoroughly scrutinized,
and all uncompleted answers were excluded. In case of conflicting
answers (ie, birth year after time of death), contact with the
respondent was made if possible, and answers were then corrected
or excluded. All free-text answers were reviewed, and replies were
corrected in case of obvious misinterpretation of the question (eg,
a change of breed category to “domestic” if the owner stated that
the cat was in fact a mix between 2 breeds). Purebred cats with
<20 individuals within the breed were grouped as “other pure-
breds.”
The cat’s age at the time of the risk factor analysis was calcu-
lated from available information on birth year, and year of diag-
nosis of DM for the cases, and year of death, or time when
answering the questionnaire for the controls.
Answers on type of diet were grouped according to following
categories: “dry” if ≥75% dry food, “mixed” if approximately
50% dry and wet food, and “wet” if ≥75% wet food. Wet food
included all types of canned food, raw and homemade diets (ex-
cluding table scraps), and mice and other prey.
Respondents estimated their cat’s body condition with a 5-grade
scale with illustrations and accompanying instructions.11 Answers
were then grouped, with estimated body condition scores of 1–2 to
“underweight,” 3 to “normal weight,” and 4–5 to “overweight.”
Answering options to the question about indoor confinement
versus access to the outdoors were as follows: strictly indoors,
partly outdoors (indoor cats allowed access to enclosed outdoor
space or leash walks, or access to being outdoors parts of the
year), and outdoors (cats that can choose between indoors and
outdoors, or strictly outdoors cats).
Univariable logistic regression was used to assess associations
between a diagnosis of DM and all explanatory variables included
in the questionnaire. Potential 2-way interactions were also to be
assessed between all variables, but the answering option “I wish
not to answer this question/I do not know” rendered very few
replies per question, and made analysis of interactions impossible
because there were too few respondents for all possible combina-
tions of answers. Rather than excluding these answers as missing
values, we decided to impute them if used by <2% of respondents,
to the most commonly used answering alternative. Univariable
analysis were then rerun on the imputed dataset, and variables
and 2-way interactions were included in a multiple logistic regres-
sion model if P < .15. A backwards elimination approach with
stepwise removal of nonsignificant interactions and main effects
was then applied to the multiple logistic regression analysis, based
on a lowered Akaike information criterion (AIC). Odds ratios
(OR) were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The sig-
nificance level was set at 5%.
Age at time of risk factor analysis was calculated as mean
age � standard deviation (SD). Comparisons between groups were
performed with an unpaired t-test for mean age in cases and con-
trols, and a chi-square test for the proportions of cats alive in
cases and controls at the time their owners took part in the survey.
To investigate the extent of influence on the results of the differ-
ence in age span between the case and the control group found in
the study (see 2nd paragraph results), we also created a smaller,
age-span matched dataset used for sensitivity analysis. Controls
were selected 1 : 1 randomly matched to the cases based on the
cat’s age at the time of the risk factor analysis (resulting in a smal-
ler dataset, and 1 : 1, as opposed to 1 : n, matching was selected
because of nonavailability of controls in some age-span strata).
We tested the identified final model from the large dataset on this
smaller dataset, using standard logistic regression analysis, and 2
conditional logistic regression analyses on both pair- and fre-
quency-matched data (with each cat pair as strata and cat age in
years as strata, respectively). Odds and hazard ratios (HR) were
calculated with 95% CI. Data handling was performed by SAS
(version 9.4).c
Results
A total of 2,212 questionnaires were received, of
which 2,175 were complete (484 diabetic cats, 1,691
controls). Response rate was 35% for the diabetic
group and 32% for the control group. Median time to
complete the survey was 12 minutes. Four cats were
excluded from the study caused by conflicting answers.
Twenty cats were excluded because the birth year was
outside the selected range, and 85 cats were excluded
because the year of a DM diagnosis was outside the
study period. Questionnaires with data on 2,066 cats
thus remained for analysis; 396 with DM and 1,670
controls.

 percent of the cats lived in a household without children
and 26% of the cats lived in a single-person household.
Most cats were domestic cats (81%), and 19% were
purebreds. Fifty-six percent were males and 44% were
females. There were 0.2% intact males, and 1.6% intact
females, leaving 98% of cats neutered. Mean age at
time of the risk factor analysis differed between cases
(10.9 � 3.1 years)
and
controls
(13.9 � 3.1 years)
(P < .0001), because cats were matched on birth year,
and owners of diabetic cats were asked about the time
preceding diagnosis which in general was earlier than
for the control cats, who replied from the last year of
the cat’s life. (In the smaller age-matched dataset
[n = 730], mean age was 11.4 � 2.7 years for both cases
and controls.) Of the diabetic cats, 32% were alive at
the time their owners took part in the survey. On the
other
hand,
of
the
control
cats,
59%
were
alive
(P < .0001). Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1.
In the univariable analysis, several of the variables
were associated with a diagnosis of DM. Burmese
and Norwegian forest cats had a higher risk of DM,
whereas Birman and Persian cats had a lower risk of
DM compared with domestic cats. Living in a rural
environment, being female, having access to the out-
doors, being underweight, living with a dog in the
household, and being fed ad libitum were all factors
associated with a reduced risk of DM. Being male,
previous treatment with corticosteroid injections, eat-
ing predominantly dry food, being vaccinated, having
a greedy eating behavior, being overweight, living
with no other animal species, and living indoors were
all factors associated with an increased risk of DM.
The number of cats eating dry food, wet food, and
mixed food was 779, 203, and 1,084, respectively.
Cats were judged as being greedy eaters (n = 334), fin-
ishing meals within hours (n = 203), nibbling food
several
times
daily
(n = 1,379),
or
being
picky
(n = 150).
In the multiple logistic regression, breed, sex, vaccina-
tion status, corticosteroid injections, eating behavior,
and households with no other pets than cats remained
associated with an increased risk of DM. The interac-
tions between type of diet and body condition score,
and between activity level and indoor confinement or
access to the outdoors also remained in the final model.
Overweight cats had an increased risk of DM compared
with cats with a normal body condition for all available
types of diet. On the other hand, when comparing cats
with a normal body condition as assessed by owners,
there was an increased risk of DM for cats eating pre-
dominantly dry food compared with wet food (OR 3.8;
95% CI 1.3–11.2). Similarly, the interaction between
activity level and indoor confinement versus outdoor
access resulted in separate interpretations for each
group. For both moderately active and inactive cats,
indoor confinement was associated with an increased
risk of DM. For the inactive cats, partly outdoor access
was associated with a reduced risk of DM compared
with being strictly indoors. If cats were active, there
were no differences in risk of DM with respect to
indoor versus outdoor access. Odds ratios for DM for
the different main effects and interactions are shown in
Figures 1–4.
For the smaller dataset in the sensitivity analyses, 365
cats in the case group were paired with 365 cats in the
control group (total n = 730). The standard logistic
regression, and the conditional logistic regression analy-
ses
on
pair-matched
and
frequency-matched
data
showed that no single variable significantly associated

Discussion
To our knowledge, this survey is the largest case–
control study on diabetic cats until now. Both new and
known risk factors were shown to be associated with an
increased or decreased risk of DM. We found an associ-
ation between dry food and an increased risk of DM in
cats in a normal body condition as assessed by owners.
Indoor confinement, being a greedy eater, and being
overweight were also associated with an increased risk
of DM.
The association of DM risk with dry food diet in
normal weight cats is to our knowledge previously not
reported, and it has earlier been proposed that the pro-
portion of dry food in the diet might not be a risk fac-
tor
for
DM.3
However,
because
cats
are
obligate
carnivores, whose natural diet consists mainly of pro-
tein-rich animal prey, it has been hypothesized that a
high-carbohydrate diet such as commercial dry food
might put an increased demand on the cat’s insulin
secretion, thereby predisposing them to the development
of DM.5 Further, cats lack several enzymes involved in
carbohydrate metabolism, such as salivary amylase, and
have low activities of intestinal amylase and disacchari-
dases, indicating that they are not adapted to using car-
bohydrates as an energy source.12 For diabetic cats, the
benefits of low-carbohydrate diets in the management
of disease have been established,13–15 but the potential
role in disease development has not been shown. Diets
rich in carbohydrates lead to higher postprandial glu-
cose
and
insulin
concentrations
in
healthy
cats.16
Chronic hyperglycemia and the subsequent hyperinsu-
linemia are associated with a prolonged and increased
demand on the pancreatic b-cells, which together with
the deleterious effects of glucose toxicity are believed to

 be a major cause of beta-cell failure seen in the patho-
genesis of DM in cats.17 In particular, if fed long-term,
high-carbohydrate diets could therefore potentially lead
to DM in susceptible cats, that is, cats with an underly-
ing low insulin sensitivity.5 It can be hypothesized that
normal weight cats developing diabetes could represent
a group of cats with a higher susceptibility for DM, as
they develop disease despite not being overweight. The
interaction present between body condition and diet in
our data enabled us to detect a difference between diets
in the normal weight cats. Our results should be inter-
preted with caution, as the macronutrient content in
food given to cats in our study is unknown, although a
typical commercial dry diet generally contains more car-
bohydrates than a typical wet diet.18 It is also possible
that the difference between dry and wet food detected
in our study might relate to a protein effect rather than
a carbohydrate effect, as it is not possible to alter one
macronutrient without another.19
In our study, an effect of type of diet was found only
in cats with a normal body condition, suggesting that
for overweight cats, the risk of the obesity per se is
more important than the type of diet. Being overweight
has previously been reported as one of the most impor-
tant risk factors for DM in both cats and people,4,8,9
and this is supported by our results. We showed that
for overweight cats, there was an increased risk of DM
when compared to cats in a normal body condition,
and the type of diet did not affect these results. It has
previously been shown that owners tend to underesti-
mate the body condition of their pet, especially if the
pet is overweight, which is a limitation of our study and
might have led to underestimation of the measured
effect.20–22 Moreover, possibly diabetic cat owners have
gained more knowledge about their cat’s body condi-
tion and about the risks with obesity, which could influ-
ence the answers. Furthermore, it is possible that some
diabetic cats might have lost weight before diagnosis,
which also could have led to an assessment of normal
weight by the owners.
Being described as a greedy eater was associated with
DM in cats in our study and is a new finding although
it was previously mentioned to possibly be associated
with an increased risk of DM in Burmese cats.23 Eating
quickly is a possible risk factor for DM in people,24
and so-called emotional eating was associated with
adverse outcomes in human patients with diabetes.25 In
people, eating slowly is associated with a lower caloric
intake and enhanced satiety,26 but this has to our
knowledge not been evaluated in cats. Nevertheless, the
finding that being greedy is associated with DM in cats
is interesting and needs future consideration. It is
unclear whether being greedy is associated with prefer-
ences for some types of food, or whether it is otherwise
associated with an increased DM risk. It might also to
some extent reflect a polyphagic state often seen in dia-
betic cats before diagnosis.
Indoor confinement has previously been described as
a risk factor for DM in cats.3 Our study supports this
finding and also found an interaction with the cats’
reported activity level. For cats reported to be active,
we were not able to differentiate DM risks based on
access to the outdoors or not. On the other hand, for
cats reported as moderately active or inactive, indoor
confinement was a risk factor. Limited outdoor access
did not lower the risk of DM for active and moderately
active cats, but for inactive cats, it was protective com-
pared with strict indoor confinement. This indicates that
more regular access to the outdoors, allowing the cat to
roam freely, is protective against DM for most cats, but
for the inactive cats, being partly outdoor might help
lowering the risk of DM. Probably, muscle activity in
cats allowed free access to the outdoors contributes to
lowering the insulin resistance, similarly to what has
been shown in people, where regular physical activity
increases insulin sensitivity.27 Physical inactivity in peo-
ple increases the risk of T2DM both directly and indi-
rectly,
by lowering
insulin
sensitivity
and also
by
increasing the risk of obesity.28
There was a significant association between previous
corticosteroid injections and the risk of developing DM.
A recall bias among owners of diabetic cats can con-
tribute to this finding. However, others have also found
evidence for this association,3,23 and it has been shown
in
people
that
corticosteroids
do
decrease
insulin
sensitivity29 and can cause hyperglycemia.30 Administer-
ing corticosteroids to cats at risk of developing DM
should be done cautiously, especially to middle-aged,
overweight cats, where other factors causing insulin
resistance are likely to be present.
The associations between demographic risk factors
and DM were identified by our group previously using
the same database, and similar findings were present
also in this study.1 Male cats were twice as likely to
develop DM compared with females, and Burmese cats
and Norwegian
forest cats
were
identified
as risk
breeds. Almost all cats in this study were neutered and
therefore, assessing whether neutering status was a risk
factor
for
DM
was
not
possible.
An
association
between neutering and DM has been identified before,6
but it is not clear whether the neutering itself causes
insulin resistance or whether it indirectly influences the
risk of DM by increasing the risk of obesity. Neutering
increases the risk of obesity in cats, probably because of
both an increase in food intake and a decrease in the
metabolic rate.31–33
An association with an increased risk of DM was seen
in fully vaccinated cats compared with unvaccinated
cats, but the proportion of unvaccinated cats in the
study population was low (7%). There are no support-
ing evidence that vaccines cause DM in cats, and the
association detected in our study should not be inter-
preted to support a decision not to routinely vaccinate
cats. The finding can be explained by diabetic cats hav-
ing had more visits to a veterinarian than control cats,
and can also refer to a recall bias because owners of dia-
betic cats could be more aware of their cat’s health and
vaccination status than owners of healthy cats.
Limitations of our study are mainly related to the
study design, especially the problems with dietary recall
bias and the difficulties for owners to accurately assess
their cat’s body condition. Owners of diabetic cats can

33
 be more prone to remember events preceding the cat’s
diagnosis of DM because of a recall bias, causing a type
I error. They can also have more knowledge about DM
and be more aware of the risk factors for disease, which
might influence their responses. For example, owners of
diabetic cats are more likely to be aware of their cat’s
body condition, and also of the dangers of obesity.
Moreover, owners of diabetic cats are asked about cir-
cumstances the year preceding their pet’s diagnosis of
DM, which can be several years back in time. This differs
from the control group, whose replies refer to the last
year in the cat’s life, in general more recently. This also
led to the fact that the age distribution differed between
groups in a way we did not fully anticipate. To confirm
our results, we performed a sensitivity analysis on a smal-
ler subset of our data, where cases and controls were
matched directly on age at the time of the risk factor
analysis. Similar results were obtained in all these analy-
ses although the substantially smaller number of included
cats led to a failure to find significant associations for all
variables significant in the larger dataset. We concluded
that the results from the full dataset are valid despite the
difference in age between cases and controls.
In conclusion, our study identified several novel
potential risk factors and confirmed several previously
reported
factors
associated
with
an
increased,
or
decreased, risk of developing DM. The association
between types of diet for cats with a normal body
condition score, where dry food was associated with
an increased risk of DM compared with wet food in
normal weight cats, was a new finding which warrants
further investigation, as dry food is a common food
type fed cats worldwide. Access to being outdoors
was also protective against DM and should be con-
sidered in light of the shift from a former mainly
outdoors to today’s indoor confinement of domestic
cats; a change in lifestyle that has occurred during
the last decades.
