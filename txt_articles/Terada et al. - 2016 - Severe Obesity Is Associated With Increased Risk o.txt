Background-—Better understanding of the relationship between obesity and postsurgical adverse outcomes is needed to provide
quality and efficient care. We examined the relationship of obesity with the incidence of early adverse outcomes and in-hospital
length of stay following coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.
Methods and Results-—We analyzed data from 7560 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. Using body mass index
(BMI; in kg/m2) of 18.5 to 24.9 as a reference, the associations of 4 BMI categories (25.0–29.9, 30.0–34.9, 35.0–39.9, and ≥40.0)
with rates of operative mortality, overall early complications, subgroups of early complications (ie, infection, renal and pulmonary
complications), and length of stay were assessed while adjusting for clinical covariates. There was no difference in operative mortality;
however, higher risks of overall complications were observed for patients with BMI 35.0 to 39.9 (adjusted odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI
1.11–1.63) and ≥40.0 (adjusted odds ratio 1.56, 95% CI 1.21–2.01). Subgroup analyses identified obesity as an independent risk
factor for infection (BMI 30.0–34.9: adjusted odds ratio 1.60, 95% CI 1.24–2.05; BMI 35.0–39.9: adjusted odds ratio 2.34, 95% CI
1.73–3.17; BMI ≥40.0: adjusted odds ratio 3.29, 95% CI 2.30–4.71). Median length of stay was longer with BMI ≥40.0 than with BMI
18.5 to 24.9 (median 7.0 days [interquartile range 5 to 10] versus 6.0 days [interquartile range 5 to 9], P=0.026).
Conclusions-—BMI ≥40.0 was an independent risk factor for longer length of stay, and infection was a potentially modifiable risk
factor. Greater perioperative attention and intervention to control the risks associated with infection and length of stay in patients
with BMI ≥40.0 may improve patient care quality and efficiency. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2016;5:e003282 doi: 10.1161/

T
he prevalence of obesity in Canada has increased across
all obesity classes. Notably, a proportion of severe (class
III) obesity has shown a concerning increase. In Canada, the
prevalence of class III obesity increased from 0.4% to 1.3%
between 1990 and 20031 and to 1.6% by 2011.2 Greater body

totaled 1.27 billion Canadian dollars, representing 5.6% of the
total cost of all health conditions in the province, and
coronary heart disease accounted for the greatest proportion
of the total expenditure attributable to obesity.5
To devise strategies to provide quality and efficient care,
determination of specific risk factors in patients undergoing
CABG has become important. Interestingly, although severe
obesity is commonly perceived as a risk factor for perioper-
ative morbidity and increased resource utilization, current
evidence remains controversial. Several studies showed that
patients with severe obesity were at higher risk of acute
operative mortality,6 postoperative infections,6–9 renal fail-
ure,6,9,10 and prolonged hospital length of stay (LOS)6,9–11
compared with patients with normal weight; however, several
other studies failed to confirm these findings.12–17 Conse-

 obesity undergoing CABG are at higher risk for acute
complications and contribute to greater short-term resource
utilization. Accordingly, using data from the Alberta Provincial
Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease
(APPROACH) registry, we investigated whether obesity was
associated with post-CABG adverse outcomes and played a
role as a driver of elevated health care costs.
Methods
This study used data from the APPROACH registry in
conjunction with postoperative mortality and early complica-
tions determined from the Vital Statistics Registry and the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical
Modification
codes,
respectively.
A
description
of
the
APPROACH database was published previously.18,19 Briefly,
the APPROACH registry is a population-based database that
prospectively captures all patients referred for cardiac
catheterization performed in the province of Alberta, Canada.
Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Alberta
Health Research Ethics Board. Because data were obtained
from a clinical registry, the need for informed consent was
waived.
Study Population
Patients in the study included adult residents of Alberta,
Canada, who underwent CABG surgery at a single university
hospital in Alberta between April 2003 and March 2014. Prior
cardiac revascularization recipients (ie, percutaneous coro-
nary intervention or CABG) who subsequently received
another CABG were included. BMI, calculated as weight (in
kg) over height squared (m2), was identified for each patient.
Based on BMI, patients were categorized as normal BMI
(18.5–24.9), overweight (25.0–29.9), obese class I (30.0–
34.9), obese class II (35.0–39.9), and obese class III
(≥40.0).20–22 Patients with BMI <18.5 (underweight) were
excluded from the study.
Baseline Measures
Demographic and clinical variables collected at the time of
cardiac catheterization included age, sex, BMI, concomitant
diseases (ie, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure,
diabetes mellitus dialysis, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, liver
disease, gastrointestinal disease, malignancy, peripheral vas-
cular disease, pulmonary disease, and renal disease), smoking
status, prior event and treatment (ie, prior CABG, myocardial
infarction, and percutaneous coronary intervention), indication
for catheterization (ie, stable and unstable angina, myocardial
infarction, and others), ejection fraction (>50%, 35–50%,
20–34%, and <20%), and extent of coronary disease. The
clinical diagnostic variables were updated at the time of the
CABG procedure.19 Concomitant diseases were collected as
yes/no binary variables. Extent of coronary disease was
divided into 6 categories: normal, lesion with <50% stenosis,
low risk (ie, 1- or 2-vessel disease), high risk (ie, 2-vessel
disease with proximal left anterior descending artery disease
or 3-vessel disease), left main disease, and missing. Patients
were identified as having diabetes mellitus based on their
diagnosis or if they were receiving insulin or oral hypoglycemic
agents.
Study Outcomes
Postoperative mortality, overall early complications, sub-
groups of early complications (ie, all-cause infection, renal
and pulmonary complications), cardiovascular intensive care
unit LOS, and total LOS in hospital were assessed as
individual outcomes. Postoperative mortality, overall early
complications, and subgroups of early complications were
defined as incidences occurring within 30 days of CABG.
Renal complication was defined as patients with a postoper-
ative creatinine level >200 lmol/L.18 Pulmonary complica-
tions
included
pulmonary
edema
and/or
pulmonary
embolism.
Statistical Analysis
Mean and standard deviation were used for continuous
variables, whereas categorical variables were presented as
counts and percentages. Baseline characteristics were com-
pared across BMI categories with ANOVA for continuous
variables and the chi-square test for categorical variables. If a
significant difference was found, each group was compared
against the normal BMI group by using post hoc pairwise
comparisons with Bonferroni adjustment. For smoking his-
tory, indication of catheterization, ejection fraction, and
extent of coronary disease, the distribution of the categories
within each variable were compared using the chi-square test.
If a significant difference was found, we performed post hoc
pairwise comparisons between normal BMI and the other BMI
groups using the chi-square test with Bonferroni adjustment.
Postoperative mortality and early complications were
assessed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model
and a multivariable logistic regression model, respectively.
Because distributions were highly skewed, both intensive care
unit and total LOS were assessed using the gamma gener-
alized linear model with a log link. The analyses were adjusted
for clinical covariates including age, sex, concomitant dis-
eases, smoking status, prior cardiac events and treatment,
indication of catheterization, ejection fraction, extent of
coronary disease, and censoring due to death or transfer.

 All concomitant diseases were simultaneously included in the
multivariable models as independent confounding variables to
adjust for the regression analyses. In a sensitivity analysis, we
also performed propensity analysis to account for potential
confounders. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata
statistical software, release 13 (StataCorp LP). P<0.05 was
considered significant.
Results
Study Sample
During the 11-year period, 7560 patients underwent CABG, of
which 1509 (20.0%) had a BMI classified as normal, 3080
(40.7%) were classified as overweight, 1942 (25.7%) were
classified as obese class I, 696 (9.2%) were classified as
obese class II, and 333 (4.4%) were classified as obese class
III. Considerable differences in baseline characteristics among
patient groups were found. Compared with patients with
normal BMI, patients with class III obesity were characterized
by younger age (62.0�9.3 versus 68.8�10.6, P<0.001) and
lower prevalence of peripheral vascular disease (8.7% versus
14.7%, P=0.011). In contrast, patients with class III obesity
had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (62.5% versus
25.4%,
P<0.001),
hyperlipidemia
(86.2%
versus
79.3%,
P=0.004), hypertension (85.6% versus 69.5%, P<0.001),
pulmonary disease (15.3% versus 10.8%, P=0.02), and prior
percutaneous coronary intervention (17.1% versus 12.0%,
P=0.012) compared with patients with normal BMI. There was
no difference among the BMI groups in prevalence of
congestive heart failure, liver or gastrointestinal disease,
malignancy, or renal disease. Preoperative demographics and
risk factors according to BMI categories are summarized in
Table 1.

 obese class I groups had similar risks of overall early

of

and

were
not
different between the 4 BMI groups and the normal BMI
group. The adjusted risk factors relative to normal BMI are
summarized in Table 4. The risk factors used in the risk
adjustment for overall early complications and infection and
their associations with the dependent variables are also
summarized in Table 5.
Propensity analysis also showed consistent results, with
the obese class II and III groups showing higher risks of early
complications (class II: aOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.10–1.60; class III:
aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.20–1.96). The same analysis identified
obese classes I, II, and III as independent risk factors for
infection (class I: aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.24–2.03; class II: aOR
2.24, 95% CI 1.66–3.01; class III: aOR 3.13, 95% CI 2.20–
4.46).
There were no differences in post-CABG intensive care
unit LOS between the 4 BMI groups and the normal BMI
group (Table 6). Similarly, no differences were observed for
total
LOS
between
the
normal
BMI
group
and
the
overweight, obese class I, and obese class II groups;
however, total LOS was significantly longer in the obese
class III group (Table 6). Median total LOS of patients with
class III obesity was 7.0 days (interquartile range [IQR] 5 to
10 days), which was 1.14 (95% CI 1.02–1.28) times longer
than patients with normal BMI (median 6.0 days, IQR 5 to
9 days).
Factors Associated With Prolonged LOS in Obese
Class III
With obese class III shown as an independent risk factor for
prolonged LOS, we performed post hoc analyses assessing
associations between potential risk factors and LOS on the
isolated obese class III group. Stepwise regression analysis
revealed that infection (r=11.2, P=0.029), dialysis (r=28.1,
P<0.001), renal complication (r=14.1, P=0.002), ejection
fraction <20% (r=47.3, P<0.001), and female sex (r=8.9,
P=0.004) were positively associated with LOS. In addition,
because both infection23 and diabetes mellitus24 are consid-
ered independent risk factors for prolonged LOS following
CABG, we included their interaction in the model. Although
diabetes mellitus alone was not associated with prolonged LOS

mellitis interaction was relatively large and similar to that of
infection and female sex (R=9.9, P=0.123). Accordingly, we
further explored the impact of diabetes mellitis in relation to
infection within the obese class III group by stratifying the
patients into 4 groups: (1) no infection or diabetes mellitis, (2)
infection alone, (3) diabetes mellitis alone, and (4) diabetes
mellitis and infection. The gamma generalized linear model with
a log link using no infection or diabetes mellitis as a reference
group showed that adjusted relative total LOS was 3.2 (95% CI

 [IQR 3.0 days]) and 1.9 (95% CI 1.4–2.6) times longer in

alone was not significantly associated with LOS (median
7.0 days, IQR 3.0 days).
Discussion
With a steady increase in the total number of bypass
operations, cardiac operation has become a major contributor
to
overall
medical
resource
utilization.25
Consequently,
attempts to identify and control risks associated with cardiac
operation have become important to provide quality and cost-
efficient care. To date, studies examining the impact of severe
obesity on post-CABG adverse outcomes have shown conflict-
ing results. Possible explanations for the inconsistent out-
comes include the use of heterogeneous reference categories
and BMI criteria for the definition of severe obesity. Indeed,
although wide ranges of BMI increase within-group variations,26
several studies used lower BMI cutoffs than current Canadian
national22 or international20,21 guidelines (ie, BMI ≥40) to
define severe obesity. It is of importance to note, however, that
contradicting findings still existed among the studies defining
severe obesity as BMI ≥40.6,17,27,28
Using the APPROACH database, we found a differential
impact of BMI groups on acute post-CABG clinical outcomes.
Consistent with previous reports,6,17,27,28 patients with severe
obesity in our study were characterized by younger age with
more comorbidities compared with patients with normal BMI,
except for peripheral vascular disease. The lower prevalence
of peripheral vascular disease in patients with class III obesity
may seem counterintuitive considering higher cases of
atherogenic
risk
factors,
such
as
diabetes
mellitus,
hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in this group. We speculate
that significantly younger age and thus shorter exposure to
these risk factors contributed to the lower prevalence of
peripheral vascular disease. After adjusting for such baseline
discrepancies, we found that obese classes II and III were
independent risk factors for overall early complications. The
increased risk of all-cause infections but not pulmonary or
renal complications indicated that, among available measures,
infection was primarily responsible for the increased compli-
cation rates. A previous study demonstrated that wound
infections
delay healing
and increase
LOS23; however,
although complication rates were increased in both obese
classes II and III, only the obese class III group was associated
with longer total LOS compared with normal BMI. We
speculate that higher rates of infection in the obese class III
group contributed to prolonged LOS.
Our results showing no differences between the normal
BMI group and the other 4 BMI groups in operative mortality
or intensive care unit LOS are consistent with previous
findings.10,29–31 The lack of association between BMI and the
incidence of pulmonary complication, however, needs to be
interpreted with caution because only 43 patients (0.6%)
experienced pulmonary complications. Our database captured
only pulmonary edema and pulmonary embolism as pul-
monary complications. This may explain the limited occur-
rence of pulmonary complications and implies a high chance
of a type II error. Similarly, relatively high ORs but no
statistically significant differences for renal complications in
patients categorized as obese class II (OR 1.38, P=0.086) and
class III (OR 1.56, P=0.068) could also be related to
insufficient power.
The
incidence
of
complications
is
associated
with
increased hospital costs.32,33 Moreover, longer LOS as a
result of complications demands greater resource use.25
Consequently, it is likely that patients classified as obese
class III consumed more health care resources than the
normal BMI group by increasing LOS and treatment costs.
Considering our results and those of several other studies
showing the longest LOS in patients with severe obesity,6,7,34
class III obesity is an important contributor to prolonged LOS
following CABG. With a continuous increase in the prevalence
of class III obesity,1,2 better strategies to reduce the LOS of
this group would play an important role in reducing overall
LOS and its associated costs.
A subsequent stepwise multiple regression analysis con-
ducted for the obese class III group showed that infection,
dialysis, renal failure, indication of catheterization, and female
sex were the predictors of prolonged LOS. In addition,
although diabetes mellitus per se did not increase total LOS,
we found significantly increased total LOS when patients with
diabetes mellitus experienced infection (3.2 times longer

with
patients
with

mellitus

 infection). Greater perioperative attention and consideration
for patients with class III obesity that possess the identified
risks have the potential to improve patient outcomes and
reduce health care costs. Nonetheless, although closer
attention is warranted for at-risk patients for better prognosis,
factors such as dialysis, renal failure, decreased ejection
fraction, and sex do not allow preoperative manipulation.
Consequently, subsequent discussion focuses primarily on
infection, which is widely seen in patients with class III obesity
and can be a potential treatment target to reduce LOS and its
associated costs. Infection has been reported as one of the
most costly complications, with incremental costs exceeding
30 000 US dollars per episode.35,36
The increased risk of infection in patients with class III
obesity
has
been
reported
previously.
Studies
have
shown that class III obesity is associated with increased
risks
of
superficial
wound,8,9,26,29,37–39
deep
sternal
wound,8,9,26,29,37–39 and harvest site29,38 infections. Our data
did not allow us to distinguish specific sites of infection;
however, our results corresponded to a general consensus
that obese class III is associated with higher postsurgical
infection risk. A potential explanation for the increased
infection risk in class III obesity includes trauma and
necrosis,40 possibly owing to poor healing of underperfused
adipose chest wall tissues,9,39 and increased technical
difficulty. Large amounts of adipose tissue limit the exposure
of the heart and mammary artery and require operation at
greater depth within the chest.41 Naturally, the technical
difficulty increases in patients with class III obesity. The
longer surgical duration prolongs surgical site exposure,
resulting in a higher chance of contamination.32,42
In patients with class III obesity, we also found that diabetes
mellitus alone did not contribute to longer LOS but significantly
increased LOS in patients who experienced postsurgical
infection. The incidence of postsurgical infections is high in
patients with diabetes mellitus.43,44 Furthermore, the preva-
lence of diabetes mellitus is high for obese class III. This may
explain the highest infection rates that we observed in patients
with class III obesity and corroborates the importance of
properly treating infection, particularly in patients with class III
obesity. Intensive perioperative glucose control may be
effective in reducing the incidence of postsurgical infection
and LOS.45 In addition, more aggressive use of antibiotic
prophylaxis appears to be a rational approach to reducing
LOS46 and accompanying resource utilization.47 Concerted
efforts to reduce the incidence of infection and perioperative
blood glucose are likely to be effective in reducing prolonged
LOS and associated costs. Given that patients with higher BMI
have a reduced response to prophylaxis, adjustments of drug
doses may also be considered.48
Our
study
has
several
limitations.
First,
the
major
limitation of the study is the lack of actual health care
cost data. The primary purpose of the present study was to
identify post-CABG adverse outcomes that would be asso-
ciated with increased health care costs, perhaps through
extended LOS. The actual cost associated with the adverse
outcomes was beyond the scope of this study. Second, we
used BMI, which may not accurately reflect the degree of
obesity.49
Third,
although
we
controlled
for
available
confounding variables, residual confounding not included
in our analysis cannot be neglected; for example, although
there have been ongoing improvements in the medical
management and care of patients,50 such changes over
time were not taken into account in our analyses. Similarly,
although we adjusted for ejection fraction and extent of
coronary disease that could have affected surgical factors
(ie, surgical duration, cross-clamp duration, and number of
vessels bypassed), failing to adjust for actual surgical
details that play an important role as a modulator of LOS
may have increased the chance of residual confounding. In
addition, inclusion of “missing” and “not completed” as
separate categories for analysis may have influenced our
estimates.51
Nonetheless,
although
some
patients
had
missing data in a few covariate categories, the main
predictor (ie, BMI category), outcomes (ie, mortality, com-
plications,
and
LOS),
and
the
other
covariates
were
available for these patients. Considering that removing
patients with a missing covariate from the statistical models
would result in the exclusion of 2725 patients (�36%) with
the aforementioned information available, we felt it was
important to include these patients to avoid data waste and
to maintain statistical power. Last, as discussed earlier,
relatively small number of patients with class III obesity
might have limited our ability to detect independent and
significant associations between class III obesity and some
adverse outcomes.
In conclusion, patients with class III obesity undergoing
CABG surgery have a higher risk of perioperative complica-
tions. In addition, class III obesity is associated with increased
hospital LOS compared with patients with normal BMI. We
also identified infection as a primary treatment opportunity to
reduce LOS and its associated medical costs. With increases
in the demand for cardiac surgical interventions among
patients with severe obesity,50 this information should be
useful to caregivers, surgeons, and their patients to assess
the risks and clinical outcomes and to better prepare for
possible
adverse
outcomes,
perhaps
leading
to
better
resource use.
