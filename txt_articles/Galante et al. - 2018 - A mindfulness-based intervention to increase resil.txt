Summary
Background The rising number of young people going to university has led to concerns about an increasing demand 
for student mental health services. We aimed to assess whether provision of mindfulness courses to university 
students would improve their resilience to stress.
Methods We did this pragmatic randomised controlled trial at the University of Cambridge, UK. Students aged 
18 years or older with no severe mental illness or crisis (self-assessed) were randomly assigned (1:1), via remote survey 
software using computer-generated random numbers, to receive either an 8 week mindfulness course adapted for 
university students (Mindfulness Skills for Students [MSS]) plus mental health support as usual, or mental health 
support as usual alone. Participants and the study management team were aware of group allocation, but allocation 
was concealed from the researchers, outcome assessors, and study statistician. The primary outcome was self-
reported psychological distress during the examination period, as measured with the Clinical Outcomes in Routine 
Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE–OM), with higher scores indicating more distress. The primary analysis was by 
intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number 
ACTRN12615001160527.
Findings Between Sept 28, 2015, and Jan 15, 2016, we randomly assigned 616 students to the MSS group (n=309) or the 
support as usual group (n=307). 453 (74%) participants completed the CORE–OM during the examination period and 
182 (59%) MSS participants completed at least half of the course. MSS reduced distress scores during the 
examination period compared with support as usual, with mean CORE–OM scores of 0·87 (SD 0·50) in 237 MSS 
participants versus 1·11 (0·57) in 216 support as usual participants (adjusted mean difference –0·14, 
95% CI –0·22 to –0·06; p=0·001), showing a moderate effect size (β –0·44, 95% CI –0·60 to –0·29; p<0·0001). 
123 (57%) of 214 participants in the support as usual group had distress scores above an accepted clinical threshold 
compared with 88 (37%) of 235 participants in the MSS group. On average, six students (95% CI four to ten) needed to 
be offered the MSS course to prevent one from experiencing clinical levels of distress. No participants had adverse 
reactions related to self-harm, suicidality, or harm to others.
Interpretation Our findings show that provision of mindfulness training could be an effective component of a wider 
student mental health strategy. Further comparative effectiveness research with inclusion of controls for non-specific 
effects is needed to define a range of additional, effective interventions to increase resilience to stress in university 
students.

Introduction
Supporting young people’s health and wellbeing is an 
investment that results in considerable economic benefit.1 
Participation in higher education is growing among 
young people, including students from increasingly 
diverse backgrounds; more than a third of each generation 
now attends university in England.2 Prevalence of mental 
illness in first-year undergraduates is lower than in the 
general population, but becomes higher during the 
second year.3 The number of students accessing university 
counselling in some services in the UK grew by 50% from 
2010 to 2015, surpassing the growth in the number of 
university entrants in the same period.4 Reasons for this 
increase are unclear, with little consensus about whether 
students are experiencing more mental disorders, are less 
resilient than in the past, whether there is less stigma in 
accessing support, and how all these factors affect 
academic attainment.5–7 Nevertheless, the journey through 
university provides a golden, yet underused, opportunity 
for prevention of mental illness in young people.8
Mindfulness is a means of training the regulation of 
attention for the purpose of mental health promotion, 
and has become popular in universities.9 Uptake of the 
approach might partly be explained by the perception of

mindfulness training as a skill rather than a mental 
health intervention.10 Evidence has shown the efficacy of 
mindfulness training in improvement of symptoms of 
common mental disorders, such as anxiety and 
depression.11 However, little robust evidence exists for 
the effectiveness in prevention of common mental 
disorders in university students, and no studies have 
actively monitored adverse effects. Previous trials 
focused mostly on health-care students, but most were 
underpowered and had no prospective protocol or clear 
primary outcome. Furthermore, there are concerns 
about multiple testing, researcher allegiance bias with 
teachers acting as researchers, inadequate analysis and 
treatment of missing data, and unrealistically short 
follow-up times.12–14 One good-quality study15 randomly 
assigned 288 health-care students to receive mindfulness 
training or be placed on a waiting list and found 
moderate post-intervention effects on psychological 
distress and wellbeing. A systematic review and meta-
analysis16 assessed findings from nine randomised and 
non-randomised trials and showed that mindfulness 
reduced anxiety among university students.
In view of the increasing demands on student mental 
health services, the popularity of mindfulness, and its 
promise as a preventive intervention, we did the Mindful 
Student Study to assess whether provision of mindfulness 
courses to university students would improve their 
resilience to stress. Our primary hypothesis was that 
provision of mindfulness courses would reduce students’ 
psychological distress during the examination period, when 
stress peaks,7 compared with support as usual. A reduction 
in distress while under a universal stressor (examinations) 
was deemed an indicator of resilience to stress.
Methods
Study design and participants
We did this pragmatic randomised controlled trial at the 
University of Cambridge, UK. Eligibility criteria were 
self-assessed by students, and replicated those used 
routinely by the University of Cambridge Counselling 
Service. 
We 
included 
current 
undergraduate 
or 
postgraduate students (aged ≥18 years) at the University 
of Cambridge, and students who believed they could 
attend at least seven of the eight sessions of the 
mindfulness course. We excluded students who were 
currently experiencing severe periods of anxiety or 
depression; a severe mental illness, such as hypomania 
or psychotic episodes; recent bereavement or major loss; 
or any other serious mental or physical health problem 
that would affect their ability to engage with the course.
Participants were recruited in two waves before 
randomisation. The first wave promoted the study and 
enrolled interested students in the term starting in 
October, 2015 (cohort one). The second wave promoted 
the study again and enrolled interested students in the 
term starting in January, 2016 (cohort two; figure 1).
The study protocol17 was submitted to the Australian 
New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry on Aug 31, 2015, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
On March 20, 2017, we searched CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase, 
MEDLINE, and PsycINFO, with the terms “mindfulness” and 
“meditation”, combined with “university”, “college”, “school”, 
“higher education”, “postgraduate”, “undergraduate”, “student”, 
or “trainee”, with no date or language restrictions. Our search 
identified comprehensive systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
showing evidence for the efficacy of mindfulness meditation 
programmes in improvement of symptoms of common mental 
disorders, such as depression or anxiety. Systematic reviews of 
mindfulness training for university students show preliminary 
evidence for its effectiveness. However, the evidence is 
inconsistent and mostly from non-randomised evaluations or 
evaluations involving only health-care students. Previous 
randomised controlled trials of mindfulness support for university 
students have been generally underpowered, enrolled too few 
students, and had no prospective protocol, no primary outcome, 
multiple testing problems, researcher allegiance bias, inadequate 
analysis or treatment of missing data, lack of follow-up, or other 
methodological and reporting issues. The largest and best quality 
pre-existing trial randomly assigned 288 health-care students to 
mindfulness-based stress reduction or a wait-list control group. 
The findings showed moderate post-intervention effects on 
psychological distress and wellbeing.
Added value of this study
We present a randomised controlled trial of provision of an 
8 week Mindfulness Skills for Students (MSS) course in the year 
leading up to the main annual examination period. Compared 
with participants assigned to receive mental health support as 
usual, MSS participants were a third less likely to experience 
psychological distress at a clinically relevant level during the 
examination period. Of the 30 students in each MSS course, an 
average of five students will be prevented from experiencing 
clinical levels of distress during examinations—evidence of an 
effective preventive intervention. The absence of a control for 
non-specific effects precludes us from attributing our findings 
entirely to the specific components of mindfulness training, but 
evidence of such effects is available in the published literature. 
This trial, co-produced with students and university officers, is 
an example of participatory research informing student welfare 
policy.
Implications of all the available evidence
Evidence indicates that preventive mindfulness courses are 
acceptable to students and universities, and are feasible and 
effective components of a wider student mental health 
strategy. Comparative effectiveness research is needed into 
preventive mental health interventions for students.

before the study began, and accepted on Oct 30, 2015. The 
Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee 
approved the trial on Aug 25, 2015 (number PRE.2015.060). 
We set up an independent data monitoring and ethics 
committee, and co-produced the trial with students and 
university officers to increase the validity of the results. 
All participants provided written informed consent.
Randomisation and masking
The study management team enrolled participants and 
sent them personal links to an online baseline 
questionnaire. After completion of the questionnaire, 
participants were randomly assigned (1:1), via remote 
survey software (Qualtrics) using computer-generated 
random numbers (simple random 
isation), to receive 
either mindfulness training with the Mindfulness Skills 
for Students (MSS) course plus mental health support as 
usual, or mental health support as usual alone. 
Each participant was informed of their allocation 
automatically 
after 
completion 
of 
the 
baseline 
questionnaire. Concurrently, members of the study 
management team were also informed automatically of 
participants’ allocation; thus, the allocation process was 
concealed from the researchers. Due to the nature of the 
intervention, participants were aware of group allocation 
for the duration of the study. Data collection was remote 
and automatic using the web-based Qualtrics software to 
ensure masking of outcome assessors. The primary 
analysis was done by a statistician masked to group 
assignment.
Procedures
The MSS intervention consisted of a secular, face-to-
face, group-based skills training programme based 
on the course book “Mindfulness: a practical guide 
to finding peace in a frantic world”,18 and adapted 
for university students (appendix p 2).17 Adaptations 
were focused on permeating every session with 
elements of flexibility, self-discovery, self-compassion, 
and empowerment, aimed at generating a natural 
transfer of skills developed in meditation to study, 
decision making, and relationships. The course aimed 
to optimise wellbeing and resilience for all students, 
and was not specifically developed for those with 
distress in a clinical range.
Seven MSS courses ran in parallel during university 
terms, with up to 30 students in each course, all delivered 
by an experienced and certified mindfulness teacher. 
The eight, weekly sessions lasted 75–90 min. Sessions 
included mindfulness meditation exercises, periods of 
reflection and inquiry, and interactive exercises. Students 
were encouraged to also practise at home. The 
recommended home practise time varied throughout the 
course, starting at 8 min and increasing to about 
15–25 min per day. Home practise included meditations 
from the course book’s audio files and other mindfulness 
practices, such as a mindful walk, mindful eating, and 
habit breakers. Before and after each class, students 
received a generic email from the mindfulness teacher 
with relevant materials.
Students were required to choose a usual session 
time and day to attend each week, but when this was 
not possible, students could attend an alternative 
session within the same week (so-called session 
hopping). Students were contacted by email when they 
missed a session to check whether the absence was 
related to a negative experience with mindfulness. 
Students were also given the opportunity to talk with 
the teacher in confidence outside course times if they 
had any problems, or needed clarification. This routine 
practice ran for two terms before and then during 
the trial.

Support as usual consisted of access to comprehensive 
centralised support at the University of Cambridge 
Counselling Service in addition to support available from 
the university and its colleges, and from health services 
external to the University, including the National Health 
Service (NHS). Participants assigned to receive support 
as usual were guaranteed a space in the mindfulness 
courses in the following year, and were requested to 
inform the team if they decided to learn mindfulness 
elsewhere during the follow-up period.
MSS courses were free to students. £11 was available 
to each participant as a token of appreciation for 
questionnaire completion.17
Outcomes
The primary outcome was psychological distress, 
measured with the Clinical Outcomes in Routine 
Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE–OM), during the 
main annual examination period, as defined by the 
Student Registry.17 This period spans May 16, 2016, to 
June 10, 2016—the most stressful weeks for most students. 
Participants in cohort one started the course in 
October, 2015, and those in cohort two in January, 2016. 
CORE–OM is a 34 item scale that has been widely used in 
UK university students.19 Higher scores indicate more 
distress. The total mean score (range 0–4) is obtained by 
dividing the total score by the number of completed items 
(as long as no more than three items have been missed).20
Prespecified secondary outcomes were CORE–OM score 
immediately after the MSS courses (post intervention); 
scores on the 14 item Warwick–Edinburgh Mental 
Wellbeing Scale post-intervention and during the 
examination period21 (total score is calculated by adding the 
response values of all items [range 14–70, higher scores 
indicate greater wellbeing]); examination results graded 
according to the British undergraduate degree classification 
system (examination ranking was unavailable); numbers of 
requests for special examination arrangements for any 
cause, and due to mental health problems; inability to sit 
examinations; questions assessing the perceived effect of 
problems on academic performance (“To what extent are 
you considering leaving your course?”, “To what extent do 
you have problems affecting your study?”, and “To what 
extent do you have problems affecting your overall 
experience at University/College?”); daily questions 
assessing problem-focused and emotion-focused coping 
with academic workload for 2 weeks during the examination 
period (appendix p 5);17,22 physical activity patterns (diurnal 
and 
sleep; 
smartphone 
accelerometer 
data 
were 
automatically sampled every 15 min for 2 weeks during the 
examination period [appendix p 6]); and a measure of 
altruism, based on offering high-street shopping vouchers 
to participants upon questionnaire completion (equivalent 
to £3 for post-intervention and £5 for examination period 
questionnaires), with a choice to donate them to a named 
charity. Prespecified secondary outcomes at 1 year follow-up 
are yet to be analysed and will be reported elsewhere. We 
additionally collected information about process measures 
(eg, MSS attendance).17
During the study, we actively and systematically 
monitored for adverse events,23 using three different 
routes for identification, as detailed in the study 
protocol.17 Emergence of symptoms was recorded on a 
form sent to the independent data monitoring and ethics 
committee, who determined whether they could be 
related to the intervention. Participants with adverse 
events were offered support.17

randomisation for participants in cohort one, and 
3 months after randomisation for those in cohort two 
(figure 1). To detect a change in CORE–OM score of SD 
0·3 at a p value of less than 0·05 with 90% power, 
550 students were estimated to be needed, allowing for 
20% loss to follow-up.20 Any clustering effect within each 
course delivery was expected to be negligible: although 
this is a group intervention, the work is highly personal, 
all the courses were taught by the same teacher, each 
mindfulness course included students from different 
colleges and academic courses, and the session-hopping 
option introduced some variability. However, we did 
intraclass correlation analyses of outcome and attendance 
data to measure the extent of clustering.
The primary analysis was by intention to treat. 
Regression modelling of imputed data included baseline 
scores, sex, age, and timing of receipt of intervention 
relative to exams as covariates.24 Multiple imputation 
addressed missing data (appendix pp 3, 4). We did post-
hoc two-sample t tests, and prespecified per-protocol 
(minimum dose assumed to be 50% attendance of 
sessions) and subgroup analyses (interaction tests) of the 
primary outcome. A post-hoc exploratory subgroup 
analysis was added to test the influence of being in 
cohort one versus cohort two. Normative UK data were 
compared with baseline values (prespecified) and primary 
outcome data (post hoc).20 We considered standardised 
effect sizes as small (Cohen’s d 0·2), moderate (0·5), or 
large (0·8).25
Regression modelling of the imputed datasets was 
used for the secondary outcomes of post-intervention 
CORE–OM and Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing 
Scale scores; no data were imputed for the other, more 
exploratory, outcomes. A total daily coping score was 
plotted by intervention group, together with locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing with 95% CIs (appendix 
p 5). Physical activity scores, derived from accelerometer 
data (appendix p 6), were calculated from the magnitude 
of the acceleration vector.26 Aggregated physical activity 
scores were categorised according to time of day to assess 
diurnal and nocturnal movement, and plotted with 
locally weighted scatterplot smoothing and confidence 
intervals. Odds ratios were calculated for binary outcomes 
and χ² and Fisher’s exact tests for ordinal outcomes 
(including examination grades because no student had 
more than one). We used logistic regression to assess 
baseline predictors of whether the primary outcome was 
completed. Analyses were done at a two-sided α level of 
0·05, using R (version 3.3.2).

Results
Between Sept 28, 2015, and Jan 1, 2015, we randomly 
assigned 616 students to the MSS group (n=309) or the 
support as usual group (n=307; figure 2). Five (2%) people, 
all in the support as usual group, withdrew from the 
study; three of four in their final year said this was 
because they could not undertake the MSS course the

following year. 182 (59%) participants attended four or 
more MSS sessions (figure 2). 39 (13%) participants 
provided reasons for abandoning their mindfulness 
course; schedule conflicts (n=16) and being too busy 
(n=12) were the most frequent reasons. 15 (5%) participants 
cancelled without attending any sessions (appendix p 6). 
26 (8%) participants in the support as usual group 
practised more than 10 h of any type of meditation or 
did an 8 week mindfulness course after randomisation; 
data for meditation practice were unavailable for 
114 (37%) participants (no response).
Baseline characteristics were similar between groups 
(table 1). Higher wellbeing at baseline and final-year status 
reduced the likelihood of completing the primary outcome 
measure (appendix p 11). The intraclass correlation 
coefficient for the main outcome was 0, and for the other 
outcomes ranged from 0 to 0·016; therefore, outcomes are 
reported without correction for clustering effect.27
453 (74%) participants completed the CORE–OM 
during the examination period (table 2). MSS reduced 
distress during the examination period compared with 
support as usual: participants’ distress scores were on 
average 0·25 CORE–OM total mean score points lower 
in the MSS group than in the support as usual group 
after adjustment for our a-priori set of covariates (table 2, 
table 3, appendix p 14). In standardised terms, this 
difference is an average of 0·44 SDs (95% CI 0·60–0·29; 
p<0·0001)—a moderate effect size (appendix p 14).25 
Sensitivity and per-protocol analyses gave similar results 
(p<0·0001 in all cases; appendix p 8).
To explore the practical effect of this primary finding, 
we dichotomised observed CORE–OM scores during the

examination period according to those above or below 
one total mean score point (appendix p 28), a threshold 
that discriminates between UK NHS clinical samples 
and general population samples.28 MSS participants were 
a third less likely than support as usual participants to be 
in this clinical range of distress (risk ratio 0·65, 95% CI 
0·53–0·80; p<0·0001). On average, about six students 
(95% CI four to ten) needed to be offered the MSS course 
to prevent one from being distressed at a clinical level 
during the examination period.
The effect of the mindfulness intervention in 
participants who had examinations or assessments 
during the examination period (n=267) was on average 
0·19 CORE–OM score points greater than the effect in 
those with no known assessments during this period 
(p=0·043; appendix p 8). The effect of the mindfulness 
intervention in men was on average 0·18 CORE–OM 
score points less than the effect in women, but did not 
differ significantly between sexes (p=0·061; appendix p 8).
In analysis of secondary outcomes, mindfulness 
training reduced distress immediately after the course 
compared with support as usual (table 3). Distress among 
participants in the support as usual group increased over 
the academic year, whereas for MSS participants, a 
decrease in CORE–OM scores after the course was 
maintained during the examination period (figure 3, 
appendix p 27).
MSS improved wellbeing during the examination 
period and after the course compared with support as 
usual (table 3). Warwick–Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing 
Scale scores among support as usual participants 
decreased over the academic year, whereas for MSS 
participants, wellbeing increased after the course and 
was maintained during the examination period, although 
less so than CORE–OM scores (figure 3).
In the intention-to-treat population, students assigned 
to receive MSS were slightly more likely to get the highest 
(first-class) or lowest (third-class) grades than were those 
assigned to receive support as usual (no differences in 
the few fails; appendix p 15). Results for grade attainment 
were no longer statistically significant in a post-hoc 
sensitivity analysis in the per-protocol sample (ie, 
participants who completed at least four mindfulness 
course sessions), but between-group differences were 
numerically similar to those in the intention-to-treat 
analysis (appendix p 15). Participants with third-class 
grades (n=7, all in the MSS group) were no more 
distressed during the examination period than were 
higher-marked students (appendix p 30). The number of 
participants requesting special arrangements for their 
examinations did not differ between groups, nor did the 
number unable to sit their examinations (appendix 
pp 16, 17).
MSS participants reported fewer problems affecting 
either their study or university experience than did 
support as usual participants (appendix p 18), but there 
were no differences in how often they reported they would 
consider leaving their course, nor in their day-to-day 
coping with academic workload (appendix p 32). Post-
intervention and during the examination period, more 
participants in the MSS group than the support as usual 
group donated their vouchers offered to recompense 
participation (appendix p 19).
Only 31 (5%) participants contributed to physical 
activity data due to technical limitations or their 
preference (appendix p 20). Activity in MSS participants 
(n=16) was reduced between 1400 and 1700 h (appendix 
p 31). This reduction cannot be attributed to afternoon 
meditation because none of these participants meditated 
for more than 1 h per week, and ten (63%) did less than 
0·5 h per week.
For all outcome timepoints, 20 MSS participants and 
25 support as usual participants triggered the adverse 
event reporting protocol by exceeding cutoff scores for

CORE–OM risk subscales (appendix p 21). For adverse 
events triggered by other means, one participant left the 
mindfulness course because they felt it was unhelpful, 
bringing unwanted matters to the fore. This person was 
referred for counselling and subsequently reported to 
the trial that they remained positively disposed to 
mindfulness.
Discussion
Our findings suggest that the MSS course maintains 
wellbeing and engenders resilience to accumulation of 
stress during the academic year, notably during the 
summer examination period—our primary outcome. 
Although the average baseline CORE–OM score of all 
participants was slightly higher than reported student 
norms (0·76 score points),20 scores for MSS participants 
at the time of maximum stress (examinations) had fallen 
towards those norms, whereas scores in the support as 
usual group indicated increasing distress. The primary 
outcome results were maintained across intention-to-treat 
and per-protocol analyses, implying effectiveness, even 
with only 59% of participants attending at least half the 
sessions. The moderate effect size translated into about 
five of 30 students in each group being prevented from 
indicating distress scores during the examination period 
at a clinically significant level (a number needed to treat 
of six). This finding suggests that mindfulness is more 
effective than other preventive interventions.29
Distress in the MSS group was lower beyond the 
period of the mindfulness courses and into the 
examination period than at baseline, which is consistent 
with mindfulness building psychological resilience to 
academic distress, as are results for perceived problems 
affecting study or experience. Wellbeing results, and 
interaction tests showing that the effect might be larger 
in people who had more stress, support this hypothesis.
Previous trials indicate that mindfulness courses 
shortly before university examinations might improve 
performance.30,31 
Our 
analysis 
of 
undergraduate 
examination results following MSS earlier in the year 
suggests a more nuanced effect: more students 
achieved either higher or lower grades after the MSS 
course. At a borderline level of statistical significance, 
we view these results of a planned secondary analysis 
with caution. However, the effect is consistent with the 
well known, inverted-U relationship between arousal 
and performance first described by Yerkes and 
Dodson.32 The value of such an effect is, inevitably, 
personal and beyond the resolution of the trial; for 
instance, an MSS participant achieving a low mark 
might, in fact, have intermitted their studies but for 
mindfulness training. Low statistical power for analysis 
of 
intermissions 
precluded 
further 
comment. 
Nevertheless, we believe that this finding warrants 
further study.
Results for comparisons of other secondary outcomes 
require caution. MSS participants more often donated 
their study payments to charity compared with 
participants in the support as usual group, in line with 
evidence that mindfulness promotes altruism.33 Results 
for daily coping strategies did not differ between groups, 
although small but relevant differences might have gone 
undetected in our design. The measurement of physical 
activity through mobile phone accelerometers was 
difficult to interpret because of the small, self-selected 
subsample; essentially, this element of the trial was 
unsuccessful. The finding that higher baseline wellbeing 
was related to non-response is puzzling, and might be a 
type 1 error.
This pragmatic trial has strengths and limitations. By 
contrast with most psychological intervention trials,11,23 
we actively monitored adverse reactions. The mindfulness 
course evaluated in this trial, in addition to its selection 
criteria and support structure, is unlikely to cause 
clinically relevant adverse reactions. Monitoring suggests 
that students learning mindfulness should be encouraged 
to discuss any concerns, unpleasant experiences, or 
adverse life events with their mindfulness teacher, and 
should be offered extra support.34
The trial participants were a subsample of roughly 
20 000 total students self-selected on the basis of a 
personal interest in mindfulness and the setting of 
concerns 
over 
student 
mental 
health. 
However, 
mindfulness training appealed to a wide range of 
Cambridge University students in terms of socio-
demographic characteristics. Participants were, on 
average, slightly more stressed at baseline than their 
peers who did not volunteer for the study. Our results 
replicate evidence from several smaller, mostly less 
rigorous, trials done across a range of higher education 
institutions, populations, and countries.15,35,36 Findings 
from all these trials indicate that 8 week mindfulness 
courses reduce distress among university students.12–14,16 
Therefore, we believe that our findings are generalisable 
to university students in the UK and other high-income 
countries. The slightly larger effect in women than men 
also replicates previous findings.15
To our knowledge, the Mindful Student Study is the 
largest randomised controlled trial to date assessing 
mindfulness training for students. The study robustly 
assessed the effectiveness of provision of a preventive 
mental health support service in real life, and was 
co-produced with stakeholders, making it immediately 
informative for policy making; however, it lacked an 
active control intervention beyond the wide range of 
standard support available to our students. Therefore, it 
was neither possible, nor was it our intention, to 
establish how participants’ expectations influenced the 
results, including through a nocebo effect,37 whereby 
participants receiving support as usual expect symptoms 
to worsen; the relevance of peer and teacher support; 
and 
other 
non-specific 
factors 
associated 
with 
mindfulness training. Thus, our study is a confirmatory 
effectiveness trial based on evidence showing the

e80
efficacy of mindfulness interventions in different 
contexts; there are reasons to believe that our results are 
due, at least partly, to an effect specific to the 
mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques that 
were taught.11
We regard the 59% attendance at half or more of the 
mindfulness course sessions as a finding in and of itself 
in the context of a pragmatic effectiveness trial. The 
attendance rate could have represented a constraint on 
statistical power, but our study was designed to 
accommodate this. Loss to follow-up was moderate in 
both groups and, despite strenuous efforts to collect data, 
remains largely unexplained; these problems are 
common in mindfulness trials.38 However, we made best 
use of available data to impute missing values. A high 
proportion of participants are expected to be lost to 
follow-up in trials testing behavioural interventions that 
are neither prescribed nor essential for health, and 
reasons are expected to be difficult to collect.
The primary and most secondary outcomes were 
self-reported, and participants were not masked to group 
allocation, such that responses might have been influenced 
by their expectations. Only one mindfulness teacher 
delivered the intervention, which strengthens the internal 
validity of our results, but could restrict their external 
validity if the beneficial effects were partly attributable to 
the personal attributes of this particular individual.
Well conducted and adequately powered comparative 
effectiveness research is needed into preventive mental 
health interventions (eg, comparing mindfulness with a 
positive psychology preventive intervention). Early 
clinical evidence suggests that mindfulness effects might 
not differ from other interventions,11 but in preventive 
programmes, personal preferences, feasibility, and 
stigma might exert as much influence on real-life success 
as efficacy.
In conclusion, our study suggests that offering openly 
accessible mindfulness interventions aimed at the well 
student population, separate from specific mental 
health services, is a useful addition to robust clinical 
interventions 
delivered 
by 
university 
counselling 
services. The 8 week mindfulness course adapted for 
university students tested in this trial is an acceptable, 
feasible, and effective component of wider student 
mental health strategies. Public health increasingly 
favours interventions to promote mental wellbeing 
placed in settings such as educational institutions;8 
therefore, whether our findings have a wider application 
merits further study.
