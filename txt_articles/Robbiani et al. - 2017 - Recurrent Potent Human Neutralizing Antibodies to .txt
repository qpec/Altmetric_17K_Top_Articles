SUMMARY
Antibodies to Zika virus (ZIKV) can be protective.
To examine the antibody response in individuals
who develop high titers of anti-ZIKV antibodies, we
screened cohorts in Brazil and Mexico for ZIKV en-
velope domain III (ZEDIII) binding and neutralization.
We find that serologic reactivity to dengue 1 virus
(DENV1) EDIII before ZIKV exposure is associated
with increased ZIKV neutralizing titers after exposure.
Antibody cloning shows that donors with high ZIKV
neutralizing antibody titers have expanded clones of
memory B cells that express the same immunoglob-
ulin VH3-23/VK1-5 genes. These recurring antibodies
cross-react with DENV1, but not other flaviviruses,
neutralize both DENV1 and ZIKV, and protect mice
against ZIKV challenge. Structural analyses reveal
the mechanism of recognition of the ZEDIII lateral
ridge by VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies. Serologic testing
shows that antibodies to this region correlate with
serum neutralizing activity to ZIKV. Thus, high neutral-
izing responses to ZIKV are associated with pre-exist-
ing reactivity to DENV1 in humans.
INTRODUCTION
Zika virus (ZIKV) infection typically produces mild symptoms
consisting of fever, rash, and arthralgia that resolve rapidly,
and the infection is also occasionally associated with Guillain-
Barre
´ syndrome (Lessler et al., 2016; Miner and Diamond,
2017; Weaver et al., 2016). However, when infection occurs
during pregnancy, vertical transmission can lead to a spec-
trum of devastating neurodevelopmental aberrations, collec-
tively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome. Although the
data are still incomplete, infants born to mothers infected with
ZIKV during pregnancy carry an up to 42% risk of developing
overt clinical or neuroimaging abnormalities (Brasil et al., 2016;
Costa et al., 2016; Franc
¸ a et al., 2016).
ZIKV belongs to the Flavivirus genus, which includes yellow
fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), and the four serotypes of dengue vi-
rus (DENV1–DENV4). These positive-stranded RNA viruses are
responsible for considerable morbidity and mortality in the equa-
torial and subequatorial regions populated by their mosquito
vectors (Kramer et al., 2007; Murray et al., 2013; Weaver and Re-
isen, 2010). Unlike most otherflaviviruses,ZIKV can also be trans-
mitted sexually, and on occasion persists for months (Barzon
et al., 2016; Foy et al., 2011; Murray et al., 2017; Suy et al., 2016).
All flaviviruses display a single envelope protein, E, that is
highly conserved between different members of this virus family.
The E protein ectodomain consists of three structural domains.
Domain I (EDI) contains the N terminus, domain II (EDII) is an
extended finger-like structure that includes the dimerization
domain and also a pH-sensitive fusion loop that mediates viral
fusion in the lysosomes. Finally, domain III (EDIII) is an immuno-
globulin-like domain that mediates attachment to target cells
(Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; Dai et al., 2016; Kostyuchenko
et al., 2016; Modis et al., 2003; Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005; Rey
et al., 1995; Sirohi et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2004). Several human
neutralizing antibodies targeting different E protein epitopes have
been described. Antibodies against the EDIII of flaviviruses are
among the most potent neutralizers in this group (Beasley and
Barrett, 2002; Crill and Roehrig, 2001; Screaton et al., 2015).

 Due to the conserved structural features of the E protein, anti-
bodies that develop in response to infection by one flavivirus may
also recognize others (Heinz and Stiasny, 2017). Cross-reactivity
can lead to cross-protection, as first documented by Sabin,
who showed experimentally in humans that exposure to DENV1
could provide short-term protection from subsequent challenge
with DENV2. In contrast, immunity to the autologous strain was
long lasting (Sabin, 1950). More recently, human monoclonal an-
tibodies to DENV have been shown to cross-neutralize ZIKV, and
vice versa (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016; Swan-
strom et al., 2016). However, there is concern that cross-reacting
antibodies that fail to neutralize the virus may enhance rather than
curb subsequent flavivirus infections (Harrison, 2016; Wahala
and Silva, 2011). In vitro and in vivo experiments in mice suggest
that this phenomenon, commonly referred to as antibody-depen-
dent enhancement (ADE), extends to ZIKV (Bardina et al., 2017;
Dejnirattisai et al., 2016; Harrison, 2016; Priyamvada et al.,
2016). For this reason, a desirable goal for ZIKV vaccines is to
elicit robust and protective antibodies, while avoiding antibodies
that bind to the virus but are non-neutralizing and potentially
enhancing. Doing so requires a detailed understanding of the
neutralizing antibody response to ZIKV.
Several human antibodies to ZIKV have been cloned from
convalescent individuals by methods utilizing B cell transforma-
tion with Epstein-Barr virus (Sapparapu et al., 2016; Stettler
et al., 2016). However, individual donors were not selected for
high neutralization titers; whether their antibodies are represen-
tative of optimal immune responses and how these antibodies
might relate to previous flavivirus exposure remains unknown.
Here, we report on the characteristics of the neutralizing anti-
body responses that developed in individuals with high levels of
serum ZIKV neutralizing activity from two independent cohorts
after recent ZIKV outbreaks in Brazil and Mexico and on their
relationship to previous flavivirus exposure.
RESULTS
Serologic Responses to ZIKV in Brazil and Mexico
Individuals infected with pathogens display a spectrum of anti-
body responses ranging from low levels of non-neutralizing anti-
bodies to high titers of neutralizing antibodies. To determine
whether a population infected with ZIKV also displays a range
of antibody responses, we screened 405 individuals living in
ZIKV epidemic areas for serum IgG capable of binding to ZIKV
E domain III (ZEDIII) (Figure 1A).
Nearly three hundred sera were obtained in November 2015,
shortly after ZIKV was introduced in Salvador, Brazil, from par-
ticipants who were enrolled in a prospective study in 2013
Figure 1. Identification of Individuals with High ZEDIII Binding and Neutralization Capacity
(A) Sera from the Brazilian and Mexican cohorts were screened by ELISA for IgG antibodies binding to ZEDIII. Each dot represents an individual donor. Optical
densities are normalized to control serum from a flavivirus naive individual vaccinated for YFV. In blue are sera selected for neutralization analysis.
(B) The neutralization capacity of selected sera from Mexico (red), Brazil (light red), and control samples obtained in Brazil in 2010 (gray) was determined by a ZIKV
luciferase reporter viral particle (RVP) neutralization assay. The reciprocal of the serum dilution that resulted in 50% inhibition compared to RVP alone is reported
as the 50% neutralization titer (NT50). The dotted line indicates the lower limit of dilutions that were examined. The five samples below the dotted line have NT50
values lower than 103. Individuals from whom antibodies were sequenced and cloned are indicated.

 from Pau da Lima, an urban slum community within the city (Car-
doso et al., 2015; Felzemburgh et al., 2014; Hagan et al., 2016).
An additional 108 sera were from Santa Maria Mixtequilla, a rural
town in Oaxaca, Mexico. ZIKV infections were documented by
PCR in Santa Maria Mixtequilla at the time of sample collection
in April 2016. Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic at both sites.
Sera obtained from the Pau da Lima cohort in 2010 after a
DENV outbreak, but before the introduction of ZIKV into Brazil,
served as non-ZIKV flavivirus-exposed controls for background
reactivity against ZIKV (Silva et al., 2016). ZIKV introduction was
associated with a broad distribution of serologic reactivity
against ZEDIII in both Brazilian and Mexican samples by ELISA
(Figure 1A).
To determine whether serologic reactivity to ZEDIII is asso-
ciated with ZIKV neutralizing activity, we assessed the top 31
sera (blue symbols in Figure 1A) for neutralization of luciferase-
expressing reporter viral particles (RVPs) bearing ZIKV structural
proteins (see STAR Methods; Figure 1B). Neutralizing titers, ex-
pressed as the reciprocal of the dilution resulting in a 50% reduc-
tion of the luciferase signal achieved in the absence of serum
(NT50), varied by over 2 logs, indicating a broad range of humoral
immune responses to ZIKV (Figure 1B).
Human Monoclonal Antibodies to ZIKV
To further characterize the antibody response in six individuals
with high neutralizing titers, three from each cohort, we used flu-
orescently labeled ZEDIII to identify and purify single memory B
cells in the peripheral blood (Figure 2A). ZEDIII-specific memory
B cells were found at frequencies ranging from 0.13%–1.98%
of all circulating IgG+ memory B cells (Figure 2A, see STAR
Methods). Although the sample size is limited, the frequency
of ZEDIII-specific memory B cells did not appear to correlate
with either ZEDIII binding or neutralizing activity (Figure 1). We
conclude that there is significant variability in the frequency of
ZEDIII-specific memory B cells in individuals who show serum
ZIKV neutralizing activity.
Antibody heavy (IGH) and light (IGL) chain genes were ampli-
fied from single purified ZEDIII binding B cells by RT-PCR and
sequenced (Scheid et al., 2009; von Boehmer et al., 2016). Over-
all, 290 antibodies were identified from the six individuals. As ex-
pected based on similar studies on HIV-1 and influenza, nearly
one half of all of the antibodies (133) were found in expanded
clones that shared the same IGH and IGL variable (IGVH and
IGVL) gene segments, and the remaining half were unique (Fig-
ure 2B and Tables S1 and S2).

(B) Pie charts show the distribution of antibody clones that share the same IGHV and IGLV; the width of each colored or shaded slice is proportional to the number
of clones sharing a distinct combination of IGHV and IGLV sequences. The total number of antibody clones sequenced from each donor is indicated in the center
of the pie chart. VH3-23/VK1-5 clones are in red, while other VH3-23 clones are indicated with different shades of blue. Non VH3-23 clones are shown in shades of
gray, and singlets are in white. None of the gray clones are recurrent across individuals.

 Memory B cells expressing antibodies composed of VH3-23
paired with VK1-5 were found in five out of the six individuals
assayed (red slices in Figure 2B and Figure S1). Moreover,
VH3-23/VK1-5 was present as an expanded clone in four indi-
viduals and was the largest expanded clone in three out of the
six individuals. The sequence of the VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies
in the expanded clones was further limited in that the VK1-5
gene segment was always recombined with JK1 (Figure 2C).
In addition to VH3-23/VK1-5 clones, we also found expanded
clones of memory B cells expressing antibodies composed of
VH3-23 paired with other IGL genes (VH3-23/VK1-27, VH3-23/
VK3-11 and VH3-23/VK3-20; blue slices in Figure 2B). Of
the six individuals examined, only BRA 138, who exhibited the
lowest level of neutralizing activity, did not have any detect-
able memory B cells expressing VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies.
We conclude that individuals with high serologic neutralizing ti-
ters to ZIKV in geographically distinct outbreak areas frequently
show clonally expanded ZEDIII-specific memory B cells that
express VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies.
Cross-reactivity with Other Flaviviruses
Nineteen representative antibodies obtained from memory B cell
clones from the six individuals were expressed for further testing.
This antibody panel included eight different VH3-23/VK1-5
antibodies from five separate volunteers. Antibody binding
activity to ZEDIII was measured by ELISA and found to vary
broadly
even
among
the
closely
related
VH3-23/VK1-5
antibodies, with EC50 values ranging from 20 to > 4,000 ng/mL
(Figures 3A, 3B, and S2A). Like other human antibodies derived
from memory B cells, anti-ZEDIII antibodies showed somatic
mutations. For example, the number of IGH V gene mutations
in the VH3-23/VK1-5 clones ranged from 12–40 nucleotides
(average = 27.7, Figure S2B), which is far lower than that seen
in antibodies during chronic HIV-1 infection (Escolano et al.,
2017). Nevertheless, the mutations in anti-ZEDIII antibodies are
essential to the binding activity of the antibodies since reversion
of the mutations to the predicted germline sequence impaired
binding to the antigen (Figure 3B).
To determine whether the antibodies cloned from our co-
horts cross-react to the EDIII proteins of other flaviviruses, we
screened for binding to the four DENV serotypes (DENV1–
DENV4), YFV (Asibi and 17D strains), and WNV. We observed
five different patterns of cross-reactivity with other flaviviruses
(Figure 3C). All eight of the VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies tested
cross-reacted with DENV1, but not with the other flaviviruses
in our panel (Figures 3C and 3D). Other antibodies showed sin-
gular cross-reactivity to WNV, or broader reactivity to DENV1–
DENV4, or YFV and WNV, and some antibodies were uniquely
specific for ZIKV (Figure 3C). Similar to ZIKV, mutations in the
VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies were required for optimal binding
to DENV1 EDIII since reversion to the predicted germline
sequence impaired binding to the DENV1 antigen (Figure 3D).
We conclude that anti-ZEDIII VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies cross-
react with DENV1 but not with other flaviviruses.
Neutralizing Activity In Vitro and In Vivo
To determine whether the anti-ZEDIII antibodies neutralize ZIKV
in vitro, we measured their neutralizing activity in the ZIKV
luciferase RVP assay described above. As expected, neutral-
izing activity varied among the different antibodies ranging
from sub-nanogram 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) to
non-neutralizing (Figures 4A, 4B and S3A). The most potent anti-
body, Z004, a member of one of the VH3-23/VK1-5 clones, dis-
played an IC50 of 0.7 ng/mL (Figures 4A and 4B). Similar results
were obtained via a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT)
using a Puerto Rican strain of ZIKV (IC50 of 2.2 ng/mL, Fig-
ure S3B). All of the other VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies tested were
also potent neutralizers of ZIKV, with IC50 values ranging from
0.7–4.6 ng/mL (Figure 4A).

 Z004 is a member of the VH3-23/VK1-5 family that cross-
reacts with DENV1. To determine whether Z004 also neutral-
izes DENV1, we measured its neutralizing activity against
DENV1 luciferase RVPs and by flow cytometry using authentic
DENV1. We found that Z004 is a potent neutralizer of DENV1 in
both assays (IC50 = 1.6 ng/mL by luciferase assay and IC50 =
16.4 ng/mL by flow cytometry; Figures 4C and S3C). Thus, the
VH3-23/VK1-5 antibody Z004 binds and neutralizes both ZIKV
and DENV1.
To determine whether VH3-23/VK1-5antibodies also neutralize
ZIKV in vivo, we passively transferred Z004 to IFNRA�/� mice one
day before or one day after ZIKV infection (Figure 4D). In three in-
dependentpre-exposureexperiments,includingatotalof14mice
infected with ZIKV in the presence of control antibody, we found
that 93% developed clinical symptoms and 79% succumbed to
infection. In contrast, pre-exposure prophylaxis with Z004 re-
sulted in a significant reduction in disease symptoms and mortal-
ity. Only 12.5% of the Z004 group developed clinical symptoms
and none died (p < 0.0001 for both disease and survival; Fig-
ures 4E and S3D). Similar results were also obtained when the
antibody was administered one day after infection (p < 0.0001
for symptoms, p = 0.0027 for survival; Figures 4F and S3D). We
conclude that Z004 was protective and significantly reduced
both symptoms and mortality when administered either before
or after infection. Z004 also displayed a suitable profile of low
poly- and auto-reactivity (Figure S3E). Thus, VH3-23/VK1-5 anti-
bodies have the potential for further pre-clinical evaluation.
VH3-23/VK1-5 Antibodies Recognize the Lateral Ridge
of ZEDIII
There are only two contiguous amino acids that are uniquely
shared between the EDIIIs of ZIKV and DENV1, and not by
DENV2, DENV3, DENV4, WNV, or YF (E393 and K394 in
ZIKV, E384 and K385 in DENV1; Figure 4G). These two amino
acids are found in the lateral ridge region of the ZEDIII, which
is a region that is associated with virus interaction with cellular
receptors (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005). To determine whether
these two amino acids are essential for interaction between
VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies and ZIKV, we made alanine substi-
tutions in the context of the ZIKV RVPs and tested the recom-
binant RVPs for sensitivity to Z004-mediated neutralization.
Although ZIKV RVPs bearing the E393A substitution remained
sensitive to Z004, K394A mutant RVPs were resistant to the
antibody (Figure 4H). African ZIKV strains differ from others
at position 393, carrying aspartic acid at this position. Similar
to wild-type Asian/American ZIKV RVPs, African ZIKV RVPs
carrying D393 instead of E393 were sensitive to Z004, and
Asian/American ZIKV RVPs with an E393D substitution were
also efficiently neutralized (Figures 4G and I). Thus a shared
epitope in the lateral ridge region could account for the
finding that Z004 neutralizes ZIKV and DENV1, but not other
flaviviruses.
Structures of ZIKV Antibody–EDIII Complexes Reveal a
Shared Binding Mode
To gain additional insights into the molecular basis of ZEDIII
recognition by VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies, we solved crystal
structures of complexes of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab)
of two antibodies isolated from different donors, Z006 and
Z004, with ZIKV and DENV1 EDIII domains, respectively (Table
S5). The Z006 Fab-ZEDIII and Z004 Fab-DENV1 EDIII structures
showed a common mode of antigen recognition, as revealed by
similar orientations of Fab VH and VL domains when the EDIII do-
mains were superimposed (Figure 5A). The orientation of Fab
binding for Z006 and Z004 is distinct from orientations in other
crystallographically characterized Fab-ZIKV and Fab-DENV1
EDIII complexes (Figure 5B). The Z006 epitope extends over
much of the EDIII lateral ridge (Figure 5C): beyond the E393-
K394ZIKV region, the next largest parts of the interface consist
of the N-terminal region of EDIII (residues 305–311ZIKV), CC0
loop residues 350–352ZIKV, and BC loop residues 333–336ZIKV.
The E393–K394ZIKV (E384–K385DENV1) motif is central to the
interface (Figure 5C) and contacts residues within the Fab
CDRH3, CDRL3, and CDRL1 loops in both structures (Figures
5A and 5D–5F). Despite the antibodies originating from different
donors and binding to two different flavivirus EDIIIs, a number of
contact interactions occur in both complexes (Table S6). Specif-
ically, the side chain of residue K394ZIKV (K385DENV1) occupies
a hydrophobic pocket formed by W32LC and Y91LC(Z006)/
F91LC(Z004) and forms a hydrogen (H)-bond with the latter resi-
due’s backbone oxygen atom (Figure 5D). The side chain of res-
idue E393ZIKV (E384DENV1) interacts with R96HC, although this
interaction differs somewhat in the two structures: in the Z006
structure, E393ZIKV forms an H-bond with the Y91LC hydroxyl
and an electrostatic interaction with R96HC, while for Z004, the
side chain of residue F91LC lacks a hydroxyl group to form an
H-bond, and instead the side chain of E384DENV1 forms a salt
bridge with R96HC (Figure 5E). Other common interactions
include the side chain of Y58HC forming an H-bond to the back-
bone oxygen of L307ZIKV (M301DENV1) (Figure 5F), and the side
chain of T93LC (Z006)/S93LC (Z004) forming an H-bond to the
backbone nitrogen of T335ZIKV (T329DENV1). Hence, the common
mode of recognition involves using equivalent pairwise interac-
tions as well as binding with a similar orientation.
Pre-existing DENV1 Reactivity is Associated with
Enhanced ZEDIII Antibody Responses
The existence of VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies that neutralize both
DENV1 and ZIKV and are recurrently found in expanded clones
suggests that prior exposure to DENV1 primes the development
of protective ZIKV immunity. To examine this possibility, we
tested sera obtained at time points before and after introduction
of ZIKV in the Pau da Lima community in Salvador, Brazil. As ex-
pected, anti-ZEDIII serum IgG reactivity increased significantly
between April and November of 2015 (Figure 6A). Interestingly,

 a similar increase was seen for DENV1, although there was
no documented DENV1 outbreak in this area at this time, with
only five DENV1 cases reported between September 2014
and July 2016 (Figure 6A). In contrast, no significant increase
in reactivity was observed for DENV2, DENV3, DENV4, YFV, or
WNV EDIIIs (Figure 6A). Consistent with the hypothesis that
DENV1 primes the subsequent response to ZIKV, we observed
a significant positive correlation between DENV1 EDIII-reactive
IgG levels pre-ZIKV and ZEDIII-reactive IgG levels post-ZIKV
(pseudo-r = 0.48, p < 0.001, Figure 6B). Together, these data
indicate that the exposure to ZIKV boosted the pre-existing
DENV1 antibody response, and that individuals with pre-existing
antibodies targeting the DENV1 EDIII are more likely to develop
high levels of EDIII antibodies upon ZIKV infection.
Lateral Ridge Antibodies Are Associated with ZIKV
Neutralization
To determine whether antibodies to the lateral ridge region
recognized by Z004 contribute to serologic activity against
ZIKV in the Pau da Lima cohort, we developed a competition
ELISA assay. In this assay, we measured inhibition of biotin-
Z004 binding to ZEDIII in order to quantify lateral-ridge-binding
antibodies present in serum (see STAR Methods). Paired sam-
ples from April 2015 (before ZIKV) and November 2015 (after
ZIKV) showed an increase in lateral ridge reactivity after ZIKV
introduction (p = 0.0007, Figure 7A). Levels of antibodies present
in the post-ZIKV serum that are capable of blocking Z004 binding
to ZEDIII were directly correlated with the overall reactivity of an-
tibodies to ZEDIII (Spearman coefficient, r = 0.7319, p < 0.0001,
Figure 7B), as well as with the increase in reactivity to ZEDIII from
prior to after ZIKV (r = 0.8190, p < 0.0001, Figure 7C). Finally,
there was also a significant correlation between ZIKV neutral-
izing activity and total ZEDIII reactivity (r = 0.5885, p = 0.0012,
Figure 7D), as well as Z004 blocking activity (r = 0.6585, p =
0.0002, Figure 7E). We conclude that antibodies that block
Z004 binding to the lateral ridge make a measurable contribution
to the overall serum neutralizing activity to ZIKV in exposed
individuals.
DISCUSSION
Previous studies have examined anti-ZIKV antibodies devel-
oping in a small number of available individuals (Sapparapu
et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016). In contrast,
we screened sera from more than 400 donors from ZIKV
epidemic areas of Mexico and Brazil to select high responders.
As expected, serologic reactivity to ZIKV varied greatly among
individuals, with neutralization potencies spanning over more
than 2 logs. To better understand this activity, we isolated
290 memory B cell antibodies from six individuals with high
serum neutralizing activity. The cloning experiments revealed
the existence of expanded clones of memory B cells expressing
E protein lateral-ridge-specific ZIKV and DENV1 neutralizing
VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies in four of the six individuals.
Three separate groups have cloned human anti-ZIKV E protein
reactive antibodies (Sapparapu et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016;
Wang et al., 2016). In all, they studied eight individuals and
documented 92 antibodies to the E protein. The great majority
of these antibodies (79) were obtained by screening superna-
tants of Epstein-Barr-virus-transformed B lymphocytes for bind-
ing to ZIKV, and only a minority (15) were directed to the ZEDIII.
Among all of these antibodies, there was only a single expanded
clone containing three related VH1-46/VK1-39 antibodies spe-
cific for a yet to be determined E epitope. These three antibodies
were relatively poor neutralizers (3–257 mg/mL) (Wang et al.,
2016). There was also a single VH3-23/VK1-5 antibody that tar-
geted the ZEDIII and neutralized ZIKV (ZIKV-116), but this anti-
body appears to be somewhat different than those reported

 here because it failed to neutralize the African ZIKV strain (Sap-
parapu et al., 2016). Thus, there was no prior indication of a
potent dominant neutralizing response to ZIKV.
We found a total of 69 individual VH3-23/VK1-5 memory
B cells antibodies in five out of six individuals. In addition to
recurring V gene segments, VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies bear the
same IGL J gene, and a limited set of IGH D and J genes. These
antibodies are closely related, and they are potent neutralizers
with IC50 values ranging from 0.7–4.6 ng/mL. This variation in
activity is likely due to somatic mutations, since predicted germ-
line versions of the VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies bind to ZEDIII and
neutralize the virus only weakly. Thus, not unexpectedly, somatic
mutations are required for optimal VH3-23/VK1-5 antibody
neutralizing activity.
Recurring antibodies that share the same IGV genes and the
same molecular interactions with antigen have not been reported
for ZIKV or other flaviviruses, but they have been described in
other viral infections, including HIV-1 and influenza. Broadly
neutralizing antibodies targeting the CD4 binding site of HIV-1
frequently utilize VH1-2 or VH1-46 genes (Scheid et al., 2011;
West et al., 2012), and broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza
utilize VH1-69 (Laursen and Wilson, 2013;Pappas et al., 2014; Sui
et al., 2009; Throsby et al., 2008; Wrammert et al., 2011). How-
ever, in both HIV-1 and influenza, the VH genes can be paired
with a collection of different VL genes, a finding that was ex-
plained by structural analysis showing that many of the essential
contacts made by influenza and HIV-1 antibodies involve variable
portions of the IGHV (Ekiert et al., 2009; Pappas et al., 2014;
Scheid et al., 2011; Wrammert et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010).
Although the Z004 and Z006 antibodies have CDRH3s
and CDRL3s of different lengths, they share a common mode
of EDIII binding. Several shared sequence features may be crit-
ical for this binding mode. The most suggestive of these is
R96HC. This CDRH3 residue appears to derive from N region
addition, thus the different VH3-23/VK1-5 clones do not share
this residue due to shared germline genes. Examination of a
large collection (n = 44,270) of VH3-23-derived antibody se-
quences indicates that only 13% have R at position 96 (Rubelt
et al., 2012). However, 68 of 69 of the sequenced VH3-23/VK1-
5 clones contain R96. The clones also tend to conserve the
germline residues forming the Z004- or Z006-EDIII common in-
teractions: Y58HC, W32LC, Y91LC, and S93LC.
The requirement for conserved IGHV and IGLV genes in
VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies appears to be explained in part by
Figure 7. EDIII Antibodies Contribute to the Serologic Response and ZIKV Neutralization Capacity
(A) Competition ELISA shows the increase within individuals of serum antibodies that block biotin-Z004 ZEDIII binding after ZIKV exposure. Each dot represents a
serum sample (n = 62 at each of the indicated time points). A line connects sera from the same individual obtained at different time points. The p value was
determined with the two-tailed paired t test.
(B and C) The estimated quantity (mg/mL) of Z004 blocking antibodies in the serum obtained after ZIKV introduction (X axes) was plotted with the overall serum
binding activity to ZEDIII (y axis, B), and the change in that individual’s serum ZEDIII binding from before to after ZIKV (y axis, C). Binding activity change was
determined by subtracting the pre- from the post-ZIKV ELISA relative optical density value (average of two independent measurements). Each dot represents an
individual (n = 62, two-tailed Spearman r test).

 interactions involving germline residues. For the light chain,
CDRL1 germline residue W32LC interacts with K394ZIKV. Few
IGLV genes contain W32; the most common of these is VK1-
5 (followed by VK1-12, but this gene is several-fold less com-
mon than VK1-5). For the heavy chain, residue Y58HC (present
in the VH3-23 germline) makes a contact with EDIII residue
307ZIKV. Y58HC is present in �50% of VH germlines, potentially
explaining a portion of the restriction. Finally, VH3-23 is among
the most frequently used VH genes, as is VK1-5 (Arnaout
et al., 2011; DeKosky et al., 2015). Therefore it is likely that
naive B cell precursors carrying DENV1 and ZIKV reactive
VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies would also be common in the pre-
immune repertoire, making this epitope a particularly attractive
vaccine candidate.
VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies recognize and neutralize both
DENV1 and ZIKV, suggesting that clones of VH3-23/VK1-5
producing B cells originally elicited in response to DENV1
were further expanded in response to ZIKV. This prime-boost,
or original antigenic sin, hypothesis is supported by two ob-
servations. First, pre-existing antibodies to DENV1 EDIII are
associated with a higher antibody response to ZEDIII. Second,
at the population level, the introduction of ZIKV correlates with
an increase in DENV1 EDIII-reactive antibodies at a time when
DENV1 was not circulating. Although DENV1 and ZIKV only
share 50% amino acid identity in EDIII, they are structurally
very similar, particularly in the lateral ridge region that is
recognized by VH3-23/VK1-5 (Figure 5). Thus, DENV1 EDIII
reactive memory B cells have a significant probability of being
cross-reactive to ZEDIII. A primary response to DENV1 would
increase the frequency of these ZIKV cross-reactive memory B
cells and thereby increase their likelihood of undergoing clonal
expansion in response to ZIKV. Consistent with this idea,
memory B cells with VH3-23/VK1-5 antibodies represent close
to half of all ZEDIII-specific B cell clones in three of the six in-
dividuals examined.
Infection by DENV1 confers transient protection to infection by
DENV2 (Sabin, 1950, 1952). Whether prior DENV1 infection also
protects from ZIKV by cross-priming or in other cases enhances
infection is unclear (Castanha et al., 2016; Dejnirattisai et al.,
2016; Priyamvada et al., 2016; Swanstrom et al., 2016; Wahala
and Silva, 2011). However, the existence of human antibodies
to DENV that cross-neutralize or enhance ZIKV in vitro indicates
that protection by cross-priming is possible (Barba-Spaeth et al.,
2016; Dejnirattisai et al., 2016; Harrison, 2016; Pierson and Gra-
ham, 2016; Priyamvada et al., 2016; Stettler et al., 2016; Swan-
strom et al., 2016).
ZIKV infection is asymptomatic in most people. Only 20%
of ZIKV-infected individuals develop symptoms, and in those
cases, the severity of the disease varies broadly (Miner
and Diamond, 2017). Similarly, the spectrum and incidence
of developmental sequelae in infants born to women in-
fected with ZIKV during pregnancy differs within and across
geographic areas, with risk estimates that range from 6%–
42% (Brasil et al., 2016; Honein et al., 2017). The biological
basis for this heterogeneity is not clear. Our experiments point
to a cellular and molecular explanation for how a history of
DENV1 exposure could alter host responses and susceptibility
to ZIKV.

 (1.998.103), and National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (C16-16). Information regarding sex and age of study participants can be
obtained upon request. Details on the size of the cohorts and time when samples were obtained is listed in the Results section of the
manuscript.
Mice
IFNRA�/� mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory and bred and maintained in the AAALAC-certified facility of the Rock-
efeller University. Mice were specific pathogen free and maintained under a 12 hr light/dark cycle with standard chow diet. Both male
and female mice (3-4 week old) were used for all experiments and were equally distributed within experimental and control groups.
Animal protocols were in agreement with NIH guidelines and approved by the Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (16855-H).
Cell Lines
Human embryonic kidney HEK293-6E suspension cells were cultured at 37�C in 8% CO2, shaking at 120 rpm. All other cell lines
described below were cultured at 37�C in 5% CO2, without shaking. Green monkey VERO cells and human hepatocytes Huh-7.5
cells (Blight et al., 2002) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% nonessential amino
acids (NEAA) and 5% FBS. Human Lenti-X 293T cells (Clontech) and STAT1�/�, an SV40 large T antigen immortalized skin fibroblast
line (Chapgier et al., 2006), were grown in DMEM 10% FBS.
Bacteria
E. coli BL21(DE3) were cultured at 37�C, shaking at 250 rpm. MC1061 cells were cultured in LB medium, with 250 rpm shaking, at
30-37�C depending on the plasmid.
Viruses
Zika virus (ZIKV), 2015 Puerto Rican PRVABC59 strain (Lanciotti et al., 2016), was obtained from the CDC and passaged once in
STAT1�/� fibroblasts (STAT1�/� -ZIKV stock, used in mouse experiments) or twice in Huh-7.5 cells (Huh-7.5-ZIKV stock, used in
all other experiments). The Thai human isolate of DENV1 PUO-359 (TVP-1140) was obtained from Robert Tesh and amplified by three
passages in C6/36 insect cells.
METHOD DETAILS
Collection of Human Samples
Samples of peripheral blood for serum or mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolation were obtained from community participants and do-
nors and frozen at the cohorts’ sites. PBMCs were purified using the gradient centrifugation method with Ficoll and cryopreserved in
90% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) supplemented with 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), prior to shipment to Rockefeller
University in liquid nitrogen. Serum aliquots were heat-inactivated at 56�C for 1 hr and stored at 4�C thereafter.
Production and Biotinylation of Flavivirus Protein
The coding sequences for the EDIII portion of flaviviruses were preceded by sequences encoding the human CD5 signal peptide
(MPMGSLQPLATLYLLGMLVASCLG) and followed by a polyhistidine-AviTag (HHHHHH-GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE). The following flavi-
virus sequences were used.

Gene synthesis was by Genscript. The proteins were produced by transient transfection into HEK293-6E cells using PEI (polye-
thylenimine, branched). After 7 days of incubation, cell supernatants were cleared by centrifugation and histidine-tagged proteins
were purified with Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow. Purified ZEDIII was biotinylated using the Biotin-Protein Ligase-BIRA kit according
to manufacturer’s instructions.
ELISA Assays
Serum and Recombinant Antibody
The binding of serum IgG or recombinant IgG antibodies to the EDIII proteins was measured by standard ELISA. ELISA plates were
coated with 250 ng of EDIII protein in PBS per well and stored overnight at room temperature. Plates were then blocked with 1% BSA,
0.1 mM EDTA in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween20) for 1 hr at 37�C. Plates were washed with PBS-T in between each step.
Serum samples were diluted 1:500 with PBS-T and added for 1 hr at 37�C. Secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-human IgG
(0.16 mg/ml) was added for 1 hr at 37�C. Plates were then developed using ABTS substrate and read at 405 nm. The relative binding
affinity of recombinant monoclonal antibodies was determined similarly, using serially diluted samples. The half effective concentra-
tion (EC50) needed for maximal binding was determined by non-linear regression analysis.
Cross-reactivity ELISA
The binding of monoclonal antibodies to the panel of flavivirus EDIII proteins was determined using the standard ELISA setup
described above. Antibodies were tested at 10 mg/mL alongside a control serum weakly cross-reactive to all flaviviruses. Samples
with a relative optical density ratio of > 1 compared to control were deemed reactive.
Auto- and Polyreactivity ELISA
To determine the auto- and polyreactivity of recombinant antibodies, ELISA plates were coated with 50 mL PBS containing dsDNA
(10 mg/mL), ssDNA (10 mg/mL, obtained by denaturing dsDNA at 95�C for 30 min), LPS (10 mg/mL), Insulin (5 mg/mL), or keyhole limpet
hemocyanin (KLH; 10 mg/ml). After washing with PBS-T, plates were blocked with 1% BSA and 0.5 mM EDTA in 0.05% PBS-T for 2 hr
at room temperature. Serial dilutions of antibody samples were then incubated for 2 hr, also at room temperature. Incubation with
secondary antibody and ELISA development were performed as described above. Previously reported antibodies ED38 (Wardemann
et al., 2003) and mG053 (Yurasov et al., 2005) were used as positive and negative control, respectively.
Competition ELISA
Competition ELISA was performed as described above for serum EDIII binding, with the following modifications. After 1 hr of
incubation with serum (diluted 1:10 in PBS-T) at room temperature, biotinylated antibody Z004 (biotin-Z004) was added at a final
concentration of 0.16 mg/mL to compete for an additional 15 min at room temperature. After washing, streptavidin-HRP was used
for detection of bound biotin-Z004. The optimal concentration of biotin-Z004 (0.16 mg/ml) was determined by measuring its binding
to ZEDIII over a range of concentrations, and corresponds to 50% of the observed maximal binding. The concentration of
Z004 blocking antibodies in serum was estimated by interpolation with a standard curve generated by competing biotin-Z004
(0.16 mg/mL) with a range of non-biotinylated Z004 concentrations, and using the stats package nls() function in R 3.3.2.
Antibody Discovery and Production
Isolation of ZEDIII+ Memory B Cells
B cell purification, labeling, and antibody discovery were performed as previously described in detail (Tiller et al., 2008; von Boehmer
et al., 2016), with the following modifications. PBMCs were resuscitated and washed in 37�C RPMI. To enrich for B cells, PBMCs
were incubated with CD19 microbeads according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Upon washing, B cells were positively selected
using LS magnetic columns, washed with PBS 3%FBS, and incubated with anti-CD20-PECy7, anti-IgG-APC, and fluorescently
labeled ZEDIII bait at 4�C for 20 min. The fluorescently labeled ZEDIII bait was previously prepared by incubating 2-3 mg of biotin-
ZEDIII with streptavidin-PE for at least 1 hr at 4�C in the dark. After wash, single CD20+ZEDIII+IgG+ memory B cells were sorted
into 96-well plates using a FACSAriaII (Becton Dickinson).

 Antibody Sequencing and Production
RNA from single cells was reverse-transcribed using random primers (von Boehmer et al., 2016), followed by nested PCR amplifica-
tions and sequencing using the primers listed in (Tiller et al., 2008). V(D)J gene segment assignment and determination of the CDR3
sequences were with IgBlast (Ye et al., 2013). Sequences that were non-productive, out of frame, or with premature stop codons
were excluded. Similarly, sequences for which a matching light or heavy chain sequence was not identifiable were omitted. Cloning
for recombinant antibody production was by the Sequence and Ligation-Independent Cloning (SLIC; (Li and Elledge, 2007)) method
as detailed in (von Boehmer et al., 2016). Amplicons from the first sequencing PCR reaction were used as template for amplification
with the SLIC-adapted primers listed in Table S3, and cloned into IGg1-, IGk- or IGl-expression vectors as detailed in (von Boehmer
et al., 2016). The recombinantly expressed antibodies correspond to the folIowing antibody sequence IDs (see Tables S1 and S2):
Z028 (MEX84_p4-53), Z001 (MEX18_21), Z004 (MEX18_89), Z006 (MEX105_42), Z010 (MEX105_88), Z031 (BRA112_46), Z035
(BRA112_71), Z038 (BRA12_2), Z014 (MEX18_91), Z039 (BRA12_21), Z015 (MEX84_p2-44), Z018 (MEX84_p2-45), Z021
(MEX84_p4-23), Z024 (MEX84_p4-12), Z012 (MEX105_57), Z037 (BRA112_57), Z041 (BRA138_57), Z042 (BRA138_17), Z043
(BRA138_15). The variable portion of the predicted germline antibody Z004-GL was codon-optimized, synthesized by Genscript,
and cloned as described above (IGH 50GAGGTGCAGCTGTTGGAGTCTGGGGGAGGTCTTGTTCAGCCGGGTGGATCATTGAGAC

TGGACTTTTGGACAGGGGACCAAGGTGGAAATCAAAC). Recombinant antibodies were produced as previously described (Klein
et al., 2014). Briefly, HEK293-6E cells were transiently transfected with equal amounts of immunoglobulin heavy and light chain
expression vectors. After 7 days, the supernatant was harvested and antibodies were purified with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast
Flow. For antibody biotinylation, 1.5 mg/mL of Z004 were used with FluoReporter Mini-biotin-XX Protein Labeling Kit as instructed
by the manufacturer.
Mouse Experiments
All experiments involving mice were performed under protocols approved by the Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee. 125 mg of monoclonal antibodies in 200 mL of PBS were administered intraperitoneally to 3-4 week old IFNRA�/�
mice one day prior or after infection with 1.25 3 105 PFU ZIKV Puerto Rican strain in 50 mL into the footpad. Mice were monitored
for symptoms and survival over time.
Virus Titration
Viral titers were measured on VERO cells by plaque assay (PA) for ZIKV virus and focus forming assay (FFA) for DENV-1 strains. For
PA, 200 mL of serial 10-fold virus dilutions in OPTI-MEM were used to infect 400,000 cells seeded the day prior in a 6-well format. After
90 min adsorption, the cells were overlayed with DMEM containing 2% FBS with 1.2% Avicel and Pen/Strep. Four days later the cells
were fixed with 3.5% formaldehyde and stained with crystal violet for plaque enumeration. For FFA, 100 mL of serial 10-fold virus
dilutions in OPTI-MEM were used to infect 250,000 cells seeded the day prior in a 12-well format. After 90 min, the cells were over-
layed as described above for PA. Six to 7 days later the cells were fixed and incubated with 2 mg/mL of antibody Z004 in PBS/5%
FBS/0.25% Triton X-100 for 1 hr at room temperature. Foci were enumerated after reaction with goat anti-human IgG HRP-conju-
gated antibodies and TrueBlue HRP substrate, followed by addition of a few drops of DAB buffer solution (DAKO). Experiments
with infectious ZIKV and DENV strains were performed in a biosafety level 2 laboratory.
Plaque Reduction Neutralization Test
Antibody neutralization activity was measured using a standard plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) on VERO cells. Diluent
medium consisted of medium 199 (Lonza) supplemented with 1% BSA and Pen/Strep (BA-1 diluent). Briefly, 3- to 10-fold serial hu-
man antibody dilutions were added to a constant amount of Huh-7.5-ZIKV stock diluted in BA-1 diluent and incubated for 1 hr at 37�C
prior to application to VERO cells seeded at 400,000 cells per 6-well the day prior. After 90 min adsorption at 37�C the cells were
overlayed as per PA protocol above. After 4 days at 37�C, the wells were fixed and stained to enumerate plaques. PRNT50 values
were determined as the antibody concentration that resulted in 50% of the number of plaques obtained with the no antibody control.
RVP Plasmid Construction
West Nile virus (WNV) subgenomic replicon-expressing plasmid pWNVII-Rep-REN-IB (Pierson et al., 2006) and a ZIKV C-prM-E
expression plasmid (pZIKV/HPF/CprME) were obtained from Ted Pierson (NIH). Plasmid pWNVII-Rep-REN-IB encodes a Renilla
luciferase-expressing WNV replicon RNA while pZIKV/HPF/CprME encodes the structural proteins (C-prM-E) of the ZIKV French
Polynesian strain H/PF/2013, both under the control of a CMV promoter. Co-transfection of the two plasmids into permissive cells
allows the WNV replicon RNA to replicate, express luciferase and be packaged by the ZIKV H/PF/2013 structural proteins to generate
e5
Cell 169, 597–609.e1–e7, May 4, 2017
 RVPs that can be used for single round infection studies (Mukherjee et al., 2014; Pierson et al., 2006). To facilitate expression of the
envelopes of a wide range of ZIKV strains, plasmid pZIKV/HPF/CprME was engineered to have a unique BspHI restriction enzyme
site immediately upstream of the envelope region by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of two other BspHI restriction sites
located in the plasmid backbone. The resulting plasmid, pZIKV/HPF/CprM*E*, has unique BspHI and SacII restriction sites flanking
the envelope region, allowing facile manipulation. PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce E393A or K394A
mutations into the envelope of H/PF/2013 in pZIKV/HPF/CprM*E*, resulting in plasmids pZIKV/HPF/CprME(E393A) and pZIKV/
HPF/CprME(K394A). We generated pZIKV/HPF-CprM/MR766-E by replacing the H/PF/2013 envelope in pZIKV/HPF/CprM*E*
with that of the ZIKV African strain, MR766. Because the African strains contain a BspHI site within the E protein coding region,
this site was mutated using assembly PCR prior to swapping in the MR766-based BspHI and SacII fragment. To generate
pDENV1/PUO-359/CprME, DENV1 (strain PUO-359) virion RNA was isolated by TRIzol extraction (Thermo Fisher Scientific),
cDNA generated using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the C-prM-E region amplified by PCR. Af-
ter PCR assembly with the upstream promoter and vector sequences, the corresponding region of pZIKV/HPF/CprME was replaced
using SnaBI/SacII enzymes. PCR reactions utilized either PfuUltra Hotstart DNA Polymerase (Agilent technologies), Phusion High
Fidelity DNA polymerase (NEB) or KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo). All PCR-derived plasmid regions were verified by sequencing.
Primer sequences used for assembly PCR and mutagenesis are listed in Table S4.
RVP Production
Reporter viral particles (RVPs) were produced in Lenti-X 293T cells, seeded the day before DNA transfection at 1x106 cells/well
in collagen coated 6-well plates. One mg of pWNVII-Rep-REN-IB (WNV replicon expression construct) and 3 mg of the appropriate
flavivirus CprME expression construct were co-transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Lipid–DNA complexes were removed after 4–5 hr incubation at 37�C and replaced with DMEM containing 20 mM
HEPES and 10% FBS. After incubation for 48-72 hr at 34�C, RVP-containing supernatants were harvested, filtered through a 0.45
micron filter and frozen at �80�C. RVPs were titrated on Huh-7.5 cells to determine the dilution to use in the RVP-based neutralization
assay to achieve �2-5x106 RLU in the absence of serum/antibody.
RVP Neutralization Assay
The day before infection, 96-well plates were seeded with 15,000 Huh-7.5 cells/well in a volume of 100 ml. RVPs were diluted in BA-
diluent (ranging from 1:4 to 1:32 depending on the RVP stock) and 100 mL were added to 100 mL of triplicate samples of 3- or 10-fold
serially diluted human serum/antibody. After incubation for 1 hr at 37�C, 100 mL of the RVP/antibody mixture was added to the cells.
After 24 hr incubation at 37�C, the medium was removed and cells were lysed in 75 mL lysis buffer and 20 mL used for Renilla luciferase
measurement using the Renilla Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using a FLUOstar
Omega luminometer (BMG LabTech). Neutralization capacity of the serum/antibody was determined by the percentage of luciferase
activity obtained relative to activity from RVPs incubated with BA-diluent alone (no serum/antibody). NT50 values represented the
reciprocal of the serum dilution or the antibody concentration that resulted in 50% inhibition compared to RVP alone.
Flow-Cytometry-Based Neutralization Assay
The day prior to infection 5,000 VERO cells/well were seeded in 96-well plates. Serial dilutions of antibody were mixed with ZIKV or
DENV-1 virus for 1 hr at 37�C and then applied to infect cells, using an MOI of 0.02 for ZIKV and DENV-1. After 3 days, cells were fixed
with 2% formaldehyde and permeabilized in PBS containing 1% FBS and 0.5% saponin. Cells were stained with 2 mg/mL of the pan
flavivirus anti-E protein 4G2 monoclonal antibody (Henchal et al., 1982). After incubation with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse
IgG antibody (Invitrogen) at 1:1,000 dilution, the number of infected cells was determined by flow cytometry. The percentage of in-
fected cells relative to cells infected with virus in the absence of antibody was calculated for each antibody dilution to estimate the
50% reduction.
Protein Production and Crystallization
His-tagged Fabs were transiently expressed in HEK293-6E cells by co-transfecting with appropriate heavy and light chain plasmids.
Fabs were purified from the supernatant using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography (GE Healthcare) and size exclusion chromatography
(Superdex 200; GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. The Fabs were concentrated to 10–20 mg/mL for
crystallography. Untagged constructs of ZEDIII and DENV1 EDIII were expressed in E. coli and refolded from inclusion bodies as
previously described (Sapparapu et al., 2016). Briefly, BL21(DE3) E. coli were transformed with an appropriate expression vector en-
coding ZIKV E protein residues 299–407 (ZIKV EDIII, strain H/PF/2013) or DENV1 E protein residues 297–396 (DENV1 EDIII, strain
clone 45AZ5). Cells were grown to mid-log phase and induced with isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 4 hr. The cells
were lysed and the insoluble fraction containing inclusion bodies was solubilized in buffer containing 6M guanidine hydrochloride and
20 mM b-mercaptoethanol, and then clarified by centrifugation. The solubilized inclusion bodies were refolded using rapid dilution
into 400 mM L-arginine, 100 mM Tris-base (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 and 0.5 mM reduced
and oxidized glutathione at 4�C. The refolded protein was filtered and concentrated, and then purified by size exclusion chromatog-
raphy (Superdex 75; GE Healthcare) in 20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.02% NaN3. Antigens were concentrated to 2–15 mg/mL
for crystallography. Complexes for crystallization were produced by mixing Fab and antigen at a 1:1 molar ratio and incubating

 at room temperature for 1-2 hr. Crystals of Z006 Fab–ZEDIII complex (space group H32; a = 385.08 A
˚ , b = 385.08 A
˚ , c = 56.64 A
˚ , a =
90�, b = 90�, g = 120�; two molecules per asymmetric unit) were obtained by combining 0.2 mL of crystallization sample with 0.2 mL of
10% isopropanol, 0.1M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate pH 5.0, 26% PEG 400 in sitting drops at 22�C. Crystals of Z004 Fab–DENV1
EDIII complex (space group P43212; a = 74.23 A
˚ , b = 74.23 A
˚ , c = 190.76 A
˚ ; one molecule per asymmetric unit) were obtained by
combining 0.2 mL of crystallization sample with 0.2 mL of 0.1M sodium acetate trihydrate pH 4.5, 30% w/v PEG 1500 in sitting drops
at 22�C.
Structure Determination and Refinement
X-ray diffraction data were collected at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamline 12-2 using a Dectris Pilatus 6M
detector. The data were integrated using Mosflm (Battye et al., 2011) and scaled using CCP4 (Winn et al., 2011)(Table S5). The Z006–
ZEDIII complex structure (PDB: 5VIG) was solved by molecular replacement with a Z006 unbound Fab structure (data not shown) and
Zika EDIII (PDB: 5KVG) as the search models using Phaser and Molrep (CCP4) and refined to 3.0 A
˚ using an iterative approach
involving (i) refinement in CNS and Phenix applying NCS constraints and (ii) manual rebuilding into electron density maps using O
and AntibodyDatabase (Jones, 2004; West et al., 2013). The final model (Rwork = 21.2%; Rfree = 25.7%) contains 7,892 protein atoms
and one citrate ion (12 atoms). 90.8, 7.6, and 1.6% of the residues were in the favored, allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively,
of the Ramachandran plot (Table S5). Residues 1, 128-133, 214-219, and the 6x-His tag of the Z006 heavy chain; residue 214 of the
LC; and residues 299-304 and 405-407 of ZEDIII were disordered and are not included in the model. The Z004-DENV1 EDIII complex
structure (PDB: 5VIC) was solved by molecular replacement using the VHVL (CDR residues removed) and CHCL domains (PDB: 3SKJ)
and DENV1 EDIII (PDB: 4L5F) from the Protein Data Bank as search models in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010). The model was refined to
3.0 A
˚ resolution using an iterative approach involving (i) refinement in Phenix and (ii) manual rebuilding into a simulated annealing
composite omit map using Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004). The final model (Rwork = 23.6%; Rfree = 28.1%) contains 3,904 protein
atoms. 93.0%, 6.8%, and 0.2% of the residues were in the favored, allowed, and disallowed regions, respectively, of the Ramachan-
dran plot (Table S5). Residues that were disordered and not included in the model were Fab HC residues 129-132, 215-219, and
the 6x-His tag; LC residues 212-214; and DENV1 EDIII domain residues 315-317, 341-347, 373-374, and 393-396. Structures
were superimposed, rmsd calculations done, and figures were generated using PyMOL. Hydrogen bonds were assigned using
the following criteria: a distance of < 3.5 A
˚ , and an A-D-H angle of > 90�.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Information on the statistical tests used, and the exact values of n and what it represents can be found in the Results and Fig-
ure Legends. Unless otherwise noted, statistical analysis was with Prism software. The half effective concentration (EC50) needed
for maximal binding by ELISA was determined by non-linear regression analysis (Figure 3A). Data are the average of at least two in-
dependent experiments. Similarly, luciferase- and flow cytometry-based neutralization assays were performed in triplicate wells, and
the serum dilution (NT50) or antibody concentration (IC50) that neutralized 50% of the virus or RVP inoculum was calculated by
nonlinear, dose-response regression analysis (Figure 4A). The Mantel-Cox test was applied to analyze disease and survival in
mouse infection experiments (Figure 4D–4F). The Paired t test was used to analyze changes in sero-reactivity over time (Figure 6A
and 7A). Univariate associations were assessed between log-relative optical densities of anti-ZEDIII antibodies at t = 2 (November
2015) with log-relative optical densities of anti-DENV1 EDIII antibodies at t = 1 (April 2015) using proc mixed in SAS v 9.4 (Figure 6B).
An individual-level random intercept was included to account for non-independence of the two replicated measurements. The two-
tailed Spearman r test was used for the correlations in Figure 7B–7E.
