IMPORTANCE Medicare is experimenting with numerous concurrent reforms aimed at
improving quality and value for hospitals. It is unclear if these myriad reforms are mutually
reinforcing or in conflict with each other.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether hospital participation in voluntary value-based reforms was
associated with greater improvement under Medicare’
s Hospital Readmission Reduction
Program (HRRP).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective, longitudinal study using publicly
available national data from Hospital Compare on hospital readmissions for 2837 hospitals
from 2008 to 2015. We assessed hospital participation in 3 voluntary value-based reforms:
Meaningful Use of Electronic Health Records; the Bundled Payment for Care Initiative
episode-based payment program (BPCI); and Medicare’
s Pioneer and Shared Savings
accountable care organization (ACO) programs. We used an interrupted time series design
to test whether hospitals’time-varying participation in these value-based reforms was
associated with greater improvement in Medicare’
s HRRP.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day risk standardized readmission rates for acute
myocardial infarction (AMI), heart failure, and pneumonia.
RESULTS Among the 2837 hospitals in this study, participation in value-based reforms varied
considerably over the study period. In 2010, no hospitals were participating in the meaningful
use, ACO, or BPCI programs. By 2015, only 56 hospitals were not participating in at least 1 of
these programs. Among hospitals that did not participate in any voluntary reforms, the
association between the HRRP and 30-day readmission was −0.76 percentage points for AMI
(95% CI, −0.93 to −0.60), −1.30 percentage points for heart failure (95% CI, −1.47 to −1.13),
and −0.82 percentage points for pneumonia (95% CI, −0.97 to −0.67). Participation in the
meaningful use program alone was associated with an additional change in 30-day
readmissions of −0.78 percentage points for AMI (95% CI, −0.89 to −0.67), −0.97 percentage
points for heart failure (95% CI, −1.08 to −0.86), and −0.56 percentage points for pneumonia
(95% CI, −0.65 to −0.47). Participation in ACO programs alone was associated with an
additional change in 30-day readmissions of −0.94 percentage points for AMI (95% CI, −1.29
to −0.59), −0.83 percentage points for heart failure (95% CI, −1.26 to −0.41), and −0.59
percentage points for pneumonia (95% CI, −1.00 to −0.18). Participation in multiple reforms
led to greater improvement: participation in all 3 programs was associated with an additional
change in 30-day readmissions of −1.27 percentage points for AMI (95% CI, −1.58 to −0.97),
−1.64 percentage points for heart failure (95% CI, −2.02 to −1.26), and −1.05 percentage
points for pneumonia (95% CI, −1.32 to −0.78).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Hospital participation in voluntary value-based reforms was
associated with greater reductions in readmissions. Our findings lend support for Medicare’
s
multipronged strategy to improve hospital quality and value.

 T
he US health care system is experiencing rapid change.
Persistently high spending and variable population
health outcomes have driven US policymakers to ex-
periment with different approaches to care delivery and pay-
ment. Starting with the passage of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 20091 and continuing through the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA),2 the pace and
breadthofexperimentationhasintensified,particularlyforhos-
pitals. Under the presumption that there is no silver bullet, the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has initi-
ated numerous programs aimed at hospitals to improve qual-
ity and reduce spending growth. These include the Hospital
Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), meaningful use pro-
grams to encourage the adoption of electronic health rec-
ords, the Pioneer and Medicare Shared Savings accountable
care organization (ACO) programs, and the Bundled Payment
for Care Initiative (BPCI).
The combined effects of these myriad, simultaneous re-
forms is unknown.3 On the one hand, the reforms may be syn-
ergisticandmutuallyreinforcing.Forinstance,meaningfuluse
criteria encourage the adoption of computerized order entry
of medications and clinical decision support. These function-
alities are associated with greater adherence to evidence-
based care, which may reduce the likelihood of readmissions.4
Similarly, because readmissions contribute to Medicare spend-
ing, hospitals participating in ACO and bundled payment re-
forms have stronger incentives to reduce readmissions. On the
other hand, the complexity of the policy environment may be
challenging for hospitals, leading to diffuse, ineffective re-
sponses to multiple reform efforts.5
Herein, we evaluate whether hospital participation in vol-
untary value-based reforms was associated with greater im-
provement under Medicare’
s HRRP.
Methods
Design of Hospital Incentive Programs
AcutecarehospitalsintheUnitedStatesarecurrentlysubjectto
several mandatory value-based reforms and are eligible to par-
ticipate voluntarily in others. The HRRP is mandatory for acute
care hospitals. Under the program, CMS has the authority to re-
ducepaymentstohospitalswithexcess30-dayreadmissions.In
the 2013 fiscal year, CMS began imposing a payment reduction
ofupto1%onhospitalsthatexceededexpectedreadmissionrates
foracutemyocardialinfarction(AMI),heartfailure,andpneumo-
nia. By the 2015 fiscal year, the payment reduction increased to
up to 3%. The HRRP has penalized 30-day readmissions for ad-
ditionalconditionsovertime:patientsreceivingelectivekneeand
hipreplacement(FY2015),patientshospitalizedwithchronicob-
structive pulmonary disease (FY 2015), and patients receiving
coronaryarterybypassgraft(FY2017).Inthisanalysis,wefocus
onhospitals’performanceintheHRRPbecauseitisthemostma-
turemandatoryCMSprogram,hasthelargestfinancialimpacton
hospitalsofalltheCMShospitalincentiveprograms,andhasbeen
shown to engage hospitals in quality improvement efforts.6,7
Beginning in 2011, hospitals became eligible to receive
incentive payments from Medicare and Medicaid by meeting
criteria that defined the meaningful use of electronic health
records.8 The criteria for the meaningful use program
evolved from stage 1 to stage 2. When hospitals became sub-
ject to the more stringent stage 2 criteria depended on when
they first met stage 1 criteria. In 2015, hospitals began to
receive financial penalties for not meeting meaningful use
criteria. We considered hospitals as participating in mean-
ingful use programs if they met either stage 1 or stage 2 crite-
ria. While meaningful use programs did not include criteria
specifically related to readmissions, many of the criteria
involve the use of health information technology in ways
that could help reduce readmissions.
Medicare ACO programs aim to improve the value of
Medicare spending by creating new forms of clinician
accountability.9 By holding groups of clinicians jointly respon-
sible for cost and quality outcomes, the ACO programs at-
tempt to increase coordination of care, reduce unnecessary
spending, and improve quality. Beginning in 2012, groups of
hospitals,physicians,andotherhealthcareprofessionalscould
choose to be part of an ACO. The ACO assumes responsibility
for the spending and quality performance of attributed ben-
eficiaries. Depending on the model (eg, Pioneer or Medicare
Shared Savings Program) and the time since the start of par-
ticipation,ACOsaresubjecttoupsideorbothupsideanddown-
side financial risk. If ACOs’spending is below the benchmark
set by Medicare, they share the savings with Medicare. The
amount of shared savings depends on ACOs’quality perfor-
mance. Reducing readmissions is an important means to re-
duce spending to achieve shared savings in these programs.
Thirty-day all-cause readmission rate for beneficiaries attrib-
uted to the ACO is a quality measure in both the Pioneer and
Shared Savings programs.
Finally, the BPCI is a voluntary, hospital-based, bundled
payment program.10 Under the program, hospitals propose
clinical areas that would be subject to episode payment (eg,
orthopedicorcardiacsurgery).Hospitalsthenchoose1of3epi-
sode payment models, which vary with respect to the length
of the episode (eg, only the inpatient admission to 90 days af-
ter discharge) and the care that is covered in the episode (eg,
only hospital and physician care or all care billed to Medi-
care). The CMS implemented the BPCI in 2 phases. In phase 1,

 CMS provided confidential information to participating hos-
pitals on spending for selected conditions. In phase 2, begin-
ning in 2013, the CMS adjusted hospital payments based on
whether episode spending was above or below target levels.
In this study, we consider only hospitals’participation in phase
2 of the BPCI.
Data, Study Population, and Study Outcomes
The study was approved by the University of Michigan’
s insti-
tutional review board. Our study population includes all acute
care hospitals in the United States. We excluded critical ac-
cess hospitals, children’
s hospitals, and hospitals that did not
have complete readmission data over the study period (2008-
2015). Hospital readmission data were available for 8 sepa-
rate data extracts. Each extract contained hospital-level read-
mission data covering 3 years of hospital discharges. For
simplicity, we refer to these extracts by the last year of data
reported in the extract; the 2008 extract included readmis-
sion rates from discharges occurring between July 1, 2006, and
June 30, 2008. Our analytic sample included 1932 hospitals
representing 15 456 hospital-years for AMI, 2785 hospitals rep-
resenting 22 280 hospital-years for pneumonia, and 2837 hos-
pitals representing 22 696 hospital-years for pneumonia.
Our study outcomes are hospital-level, 30-day risk-
standardized readmission for AMI, heart failure, and pneu-
monia (eFigures 1-3 in the Supplement). Readmission rates for
thesediagnoseshavebeentargetedsincethestartoftheHRRP.
Data on 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates were
downloaded from CMS’
s Hospital Compare website. Hospital
outcome data were linked to publicly available data on mean-
ingful use programs and BPCI participation from CMS, and to
data on hospital participation in ACO programs from Leavitt
Partners (Table 1).11 We also used data on hospital teaching sta-
tus, number of beds, and hospitals’Disproportionate Share In-
dex (a measure of the socioeconomic status of hospitals’pa-
tients) from CMS’
s 2010 Final Rule Impact File.12
Design and Statistical Analysis
We performed an interrupted time series analysis to test the
association between the HRRP and readmissions. This analy-
sis tests whether there were greater changes in risk-
standardized 30-day readmission rates after the HRRP was ini-
tiated relative to the preintervention trends for AMI, heart
failure, and pneumonia. Given evidence of spillover effects to
nonpenalized conditions, we did not evaluate the impact of
the HRRP using nonpenalized conditions as controls.7,13

 We considered the start date of the HRRP to be April 2010,
the month following the passage of the ACA, which autho-
rized the HRRP. While the penalties began to apply to hospi-
tals in FY 2013, these penalties were based on hospital perfor-
mance between July 2008 and June 2010. April 2010 is the
earliest period in which hospitals could have begun to im-
prove their performance in response to the HRRP.
We used data on hospital-level, 30-day risk standardized
readmission rates from Hospital Compare extracts. These data
allowed us to evaluate hospital performance using the pre-
cise risk-adjustment and standardization methods that CMS
used to determine penalties in the HRRP. Because data were
availableforrolling36-monthperiods,wewerenotabletomea-
sure readmission rates during intervals that immediately pre-
ceded and followed the passage of the ACA. To address this,
our measure of hospital exposure to the HRRP was specified
as the proportion of months in a given data extract that fol-
lowed the ACA. For instance, the 2010 data extract included
discharges from July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2010. Be-
cause 3 of the months covered in this extract followed the ACA
(April, May, and June of 2010), the exposure variable was set
to 3 of 36 = 0.083. For the 2011 data extract, the exposure was
set to 15 of 36 = 0.417 (see eMethods and eFigure 4 in the
Supplement). The exposure value took on a maximum value
of 1 and was constant for all hospitals within a given year.
We estimated separate linear fixed-effects models for AMI,
heart failure, and pneumonia at the hospital-year level. Our
specificationincludedhospitalfixed-effects,lineartimetrends,
and exposure to the HRRP. To test whether the effect of the
HRRP was modified by hospitals’participation in voluntary re-
forms, we added interaction terms between the exposure vari-
able and hospitals’time-varying participation in the mean-
ingful use, ACO, and BPCI programs. These specifications also
included interaction terms between the exposure variable and
hospital characteristics (teaching, size, and the Disproportion-
ate Share Index) (see eMethods in the Supplement). To test
whether hospital participation in multiple voluntary reforms
modifiedtheimpactoftheHRRP,weincluded2-wayand3-way
interactions between the voluntary reforms and the expo-
sure to the HRRP. We did not report the results for hospitals
thatparticipatedintheBPCIaloneorBPCIincombinationwith
ACO programs, both of which had cell sizes that were too small
to yield stable estimates (see eTable 1 in the Supplement).

untary reforms may be a proxy for hospitals’interest and ca-

hospitals that participated in voluntary reforms had different
readmission rates when they began to participate in specific
reforms (compared with hospitals that had not yet partici-
pated). We then estimated models that randomly assigned the
hospital participation dates for the voluntary reforms. If the
estimates from these models were similar in magnitude to our
main effects of the voluntary programs, it would suggest that
our main effects were biased by selection.14

Results
Among the 2837 hospitals in this study, participation in value-
based reforms varied considerably over the study period
(Figure1).In2010,nohospitalswereparticipatinginthemean-
ingful use, ACO, or BPCI programs. By 2015, only 56 hospitals
were not participating in at least 1 of these programs. The great-
est share of hospitals participated in meaningful use pro-
grams (97.5% in 2015), followed by ACO programs (18.3% in
2015), and BPCI (11.9% in 2015).
For each of the incentivized diagnoses, risk-standardized
readmission rates fell after the ACA was initiated (Figure 2).
Among all hospitals from 2008 to 2015, 30-day risk standard-
ized readmission rates decreased from 19.9 to 16.9 for AMI,
from 24.6 to 22.0 for heart failure, and from 18.3 to 17.2 for
pneumonia (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Estimates from our interrupted time-series analysis
(Table 2) show that the association between the HRRP and 30-
day readmission was −1.46 percentage points for AMI (95% CI,
−1.59 to −1.32), −2.13 percentage points for heart failure (95%
CI, −2.28 to−1.99), and −1.32 percentage points for pneumo-
nia (95% CI, −1.44 to −1.29). Among hospitals that did not par-
ticipate in any voluntary reforms, the association between the
HRRPand30-dayreadmissionwas−0.76percentagepointsfor
AMI(95%CI,−0.93to−0.60),−1.30percentagepointsforheart

ticipation in ACO programs alone was associated with an addi-
tionalchangein30-dayreadmissionsof−0.94percentagepoints

failure(95%CI,−1.26to−0.41),and−0.59percentagepointsfor
pneumonia (95% CI, −1.00 to −0.18).
Participation in multiple reforms led to additional im-
provement (Table 2, Figure 3). For instance, compared with
hospitals that participated in no reforms, participation in all 3
programs (meaningful use, ACOs, and BPCI) was associated
with an additional change in 30-day readmissions of −1.27 per-
centage points for AMI (95% CI, −1.58 to −0.97), −1.64 percent-
age points for heart failure (95% CI, −2.02 to −1.26), and −1.05
percentage points for pneumonia (95% CI, −1.32 to −0.78).
In the supplemental analysis, we found that the count of
voluntary programs in which a hospital participated (eg, 0, 1,
2, 3) was similarly associated with reductions in 30-day read-
missions (eTable 3 in the Supplement). We also found that
longer periods of exposure to the voluntary programs were
associated with greater reductions in readmissions (eTable 4
in the Supplement). Sensitivity analysis that explored the
potential impact of selection bias found that hospitals that
participated in voluntary reforms did not have different per-
formance at baseline than those that eventually participated
(eTable 5 in the Supplement). We also found that estimates of
the impact of voluntary reforms from models that randomly
assigned the timing of hospital participation in voluntary
reforms were very small and were almost always non-
significant (eTable 6 in the Supplement). This analysis sug-
gests that the association between participation in voluntary
reforms and readmission reductions was not largely due to
selection.
Discussion
We found that hospital participation in 1 or more voluntary
value-based reforms—including the Meaningful Use of Elec-
tronic Health Records program, the ACO programs, and the
Bundled Payment for Care Initiative—was associated with re-
ductions in 30-day risk-standardized readmissions that were
greater than reductions from participation in the HRRP alone.
While other studies have documented the effects of the HRRP
on safety net hospitals,15-17 to our knowledge, ours is the first
to consider whether these effects were enhanced by hospital
participation in voluntary value-based reforms.
The impact of hospital participation in these voluntary re-
forms is substantial (eTables 7-10 in the Supplement). Com-
bining our estimates with published figures on the number of
readmissions and Medicare spending per readmission, we es-
timate that, across the 3 targeted diagnoses, in 2015 hospital
participation in meaningful use, ACOs, and BPCI programs led
to 2377 fewer readmissions (95% CI, −2516 to −2238) saving
Medicare −$32 746 283 (95% CI, −$34 656 437 to −$30 834 271).
Our findings are subject to different interpretations. It is
possible that hospitals that engaged in voluntary reforms were
more were more likely to have reduced readmissions, regard-
less of whether they had participated in the reforms. Volun-
tary participation in these reforms may be a proxy for hospi-
tals’capacity and willingness to develop clinical processes to
improve quality.
To account for such self-selection, our analysis con-
trolled for hospital characteristics that did not change over the
study period, which may include the structural capacity to re-
duce readmissions. In addition, our main analysis found that
the specific timing of participation in voluntary reforms was
associated with improvement in readmissions. Sensitivity
analysis confirmed this result. Taken together, these results
suggest that engagement in reform was not a mere proxy for
other factors that may drive improvements in readmissions.
Instead, participation in other voluntary reform pro-
grams offered by the CMS may have enhanced hospitals in-
frastructure and strengthened their incentives to reduce
readmissions. Meaningful use programs may have increased
adherence to evidence-based care (eg, the use of postdis-
charge instructions) while also improving coordination
through electronic information exchange, registries, and
patient engagement tools, all of which could have reduced

 readmissions.4,18 The ACO and BPCI programs increased hos-
pital incentives to reduce readmissions.19 This may have led
hospitals to enhance care coordination and increase the adop-
tion of specific protocols to reduce readmissions, such as es-
timating the risk of readmission, discharging patients with fol-
low-up appointments, and using electronic medication
reconciliation.6,20
Limitations
Our study has several limitations. First, programs and poli-
cies other than the HRRP have accelerated reductions in re-
admissions. Prior to the enactment of the ACA, concerns about
high readmission rates in Medicare were expressed on the na-
tional level. In addition to establishing the HRRP, the CMS took
steps to reduce readmissions through publicly reporting data
on Hospital Compare and funding hospital-level improve-
ments as part of the Partnership for Patients’Hospital Engage-
ment Networks.21,22 These initiatives, rather than the HRRP
alone, could have contributed to reductions in readmissions.
However, these initiatives are unrelated to the additional ben-
efits from engaging in other voluntary programs.
Our analysis was conducted at the hospital-level, which
allowed us analyze the precise hospital readmission rates that
were used to determine penalties in the HRRP. Nonetheless,
a patient-level analysis would have allowed for a more fine-
grainedaccountingoftherelationshipbetweenpatientriskfac-
tors and readmission rates.
Our interrupted time-series design may also be compro-
misedby“shocks”independentoftheHRRPthatcouldhaveaf-
fectedreadmissions.However,readmissionswererelativelyflat

Alternative research designs to evaluate the HRRP have other
weaknesses. Published research suggests that the HRRP de-
creased readmission rates for non-Medicare patients (eg, com-
mercially insured patients) and for nontargeted diagnoses (eg,
gastrointestinal diseases).7,13,23 These spillovers can bias esti-
mates of the HRRP when evaluations are based on comparing
readmission rates between patients who were targeted and not
targetedbytheprogram.Theconsistencyofourestimatesusing
theinterruptedtimeseriesacrossthetargeteddiagnoses,along
withsimilarevidencefromotherresearch,suggeststhattheini-
tiation of the HRRP is likely to be responsible for the observed
reduction in readmissions.24,25
Finally, the HRRP is unique in the strength of its finan-
cial incentives and its apparent ability to motivate hospitals
to improve.26 It is unknown, and perhaps unlikely, whether
participation in voluntary reforms would drive improvement
in other mandatory reforms, such as Hospital Value-Based
Purchasing.
Conclusions
Despite these limitations, our results help to address the ques-
tion of how multiple programs focused on increasing hospi-
tal value interact.27 Our study suggests that hospital engage-
ment with voluntary value-based reforms was associated with
greater reductions in readmissions. These findings lend sup-
portforCMS’
