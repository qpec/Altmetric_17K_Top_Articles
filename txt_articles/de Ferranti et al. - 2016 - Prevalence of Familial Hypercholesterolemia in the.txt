F
amilial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disor-
der that causes severely elevated low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C). Untreated FH is associated with 
a ~90-fold increase in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
(ASCVD) mortality in young adults.1 Using statins (HMG-
CoA reductase inhibitors) early in life can substantially reduce 
ASCVD in FH.2 Therefore, early identification of FH has the 
potential to have an important clinical and public health impact.

Clinical Perspective on p 1072
The impact of FH on the health of the US population 
depends partly on the proportion of the population affected. 
Published estimates of FH prevalence vary substantially from 
1 in 500 to 1 in 137, depending on the population’s ancestry 
and the criteria used to define the disease. Reported prevalence 
rates are frequently derived from white European popula-
tions,3,4 which are less racially and ethnically diverse than the 
US and in some cases reflect strong founder effects (reduced 
genetic diversity resulting from descent from a small coloniz-
ing population)5 or possibly less overall population mobility.6 
The US prevalence of FH is unknown, making it challenging 
for clinicians and public health officials to appreciate the bur-
den of disease in the population.
To estimate the US prevalence of FH, we applied a modi-
fied version of the Dutch Lipid Clinic (DLC) criteria7 to par-
ticipants in the 1999 to 2012 National Health and Education 
National Surveys (NHANES), nationally representative 
surveys of the US population.8 We chose to use the DLC 
definition because it is the most easily adaptable for use in 
population surveys and to facilitate comparison with other 
FH prevalence estimates that have also used these criteria.4,6,7 
The DLC definition classifies individuals as having definite or 
probable FH on the basis of LDL-C levels, physical exami-
nation findings, genetic criteria, and personal and family his-
tory of premature ASCVD (coronary artery disease, stroke, or 
Background—The prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is commonly reported as 1 in 500. European reports 
suggest a higher prevalence; the US FH prevalence is unknown.
Methods and Results—The 1999 to 2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants ≥20 
years of age (n=36 949) were analyzed to estimate the prevalence of FH with available Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria, 
including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and personal and family history of premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease. Prevalence and confidence intervals of probable/definite FH were calculated for the overall population and by 
age, sex, obesity status (body mass index ≥30 kg/m2), and race/ethnicity. Results were extrapolated to the 210 million 
US adults ≥20 years of age. The estimated overall US prevalence of probable/definite FH was 0.40% (95% confidence 
interval, 0.32–0.48) or 1 in 250 (95% confidence interval, 1 in 311 to 209), suggesting that 834 500 US adults have FH. 
Prevalence varied by age, being least common in 20 to 29 year olds (0.06%, 1 in 1557) and most common in 60 to 69 
year olds (0.85%, 1 in 118). FH prevalence was similar in men and women (0.40%, 1 in 250) but varied by race/ethnicity 
(whites: 0.40%, 1 in 249; blacks: 0.47%, 1 in 211; Mexican Americans: 0.24%, 1 in 414; other races: 0.29%, 1 in 343). 
More obese participants qualified as probable/definite FH (0.58%, 1 in 172) than nonobese (0.31%, 1 in 325).
Conclusions—FH, defined with Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria available in NHANES, affects 1 in 250 US adults. 
Variations in prevalence by age and obesity status suggest that clinical criteria may not be sufficient to estimate FH 
prevalence.

peripheral vascular disease). We examined the overall preva-
lence of FH in NHANES adult participants and secondarily in 
adolescents, and we stratified by age, sex, obesity status, and 
race/ethnicity to better understand the potential impact of FH 
on the health of the US public.
Methods
The study sample was selected from 36 949 US noninstitutionalized 
adult civilians participating in NHANES from 1999 to 2012. This 
sample was restricted to participants who were ≥20 years old and 
not pregnant. We secondarily analyzed nonpregnant NHANES par-
ticipants 12 to 19 years of age; a total of 13 343 adolescents were 
included in this analysis. The National Center for Health Statistics 
ethics review board approved the conduct of NHANES, and par-
ticipants gave written informed consent. The analysis was deemed 
exempt by the institutional review board of the Tufts Health Sciences 
Campus.
Measurements
Height and weight were measured with a digital scale and stadiom-
eter in the NHANES mobile examination center. Body mass index 
was calculated as kilograms divided by meters squared, and obesity 
was defined as body mass index ≥30 kg/m2.9
Laboratories
Lipid profiles were measured from morning peripheral blood draws; 
97.6% of the participants with LDL-C values reported fasting for 
≥8 hours. Serum total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured 
enzymatically; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was measured by 
direct immunoassay or by precipitation.10 LDL-C was calculated by 
the Friedewald equation if the triglycerides level was ≤4.5 mmol/L 
(400 mg/dL).11
History
NHANES collected personal history of ASCVD and age of onset by 
self-report. These variables were used to derive an indicator for early 
ASCVD, defined as coronary heart disease, angina or heart attack, or 
stroke at ≤55 years of age in men and ≤60 years of age in women. 
History of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking (currently 
smoking some days or every day) were also assessed as part of 
NHANES. Family history of early ASCVD was defined as having a 
parent or sibling with heart attack or angina at <50 years of age and 
was included in NHANES starting in 2005.
Definition of FH
The DLC criteria for FH, chosen for use in this analysis because they 
can be applied to survey and population data, assign points based on 
LDL-C levels (graded from 8 points for LDL-C >8.5 mmol/L [330 
mg/dL] down to 1 point for 4.0–4.9 mmol/L [155–189 mg/dL]), 
known gene defect causative for FH (8 points), personal history of 
early ASCVD (2 points), family history of early ASCVD or high 
cholesterol (LDL-C >95th percentile for age, sex, and country) in a 
first-degree relative (1 point each), and personal and physical exami-
nation findings of xanthoma (6 points) and arcus cornea (4 points) 
at a young age.12 An individual is classified as having definite FH 
(≥8 points) or probable FH (6–8 points). Some DLC criteria, namely 
genetic testing, family history of hypercholesterolemia, personal his-
tory of peripheral arterial disease, and relevant physical examination 
findings, were not collected in NHANES and were not considered in 
this analysis.
Missing Values
Because of incomplete data for some criteria of the DLC definition 
of FH in some adult NHANES participants, particularly LDL-C 
level and family history of early ACVD, a sensitivity analysis used 
imputation to estimate missing data. On the basis of a Markov chain 
Monte Carlo method, which assumes multivariate normality, we used 
multiple imputation to account for missing values for the DLC cri-
teria. Specifically, 10 data sets were imputed with the use of PROC 
MI in SAS to estimate missing values for 58.8% of LDL-C values, 
<1% for personal history of early ASCVD, and 41.4% for family his-
tory of early ASCVD.13 According to the NHANES protocol, LDL-C 
values were measured only for participants who were examined in 
the morning session; we tested for whether there were differences in 
LDL-C values on the basis of time of session attendance. We tested 
for whether missingness of LDL-C was associated with age, sex, per-
sonal history of early ASCVD, and family history of ASCVD and 
whether missingness of familial ASCVD was associated with age, 
sex, personal history of early ASCVD, and LDL-C value. The χ2 test 
was used for categorical variables, and linear regression was used 
for continuous variables. These tests were done with the SURVEY 
procedures in SAS to account for the weighting, clusters, and strata 
present in the NHANES data.
Statistical Methods
For the primary analysis, we included all participants, regardless of 
fasting status. For individuals reporting statin use, we multiplied their 
LDL-C level by 1.43 to estimate untreated LDL-C levels, as was done 
by Benn et al7 and Edwards and Moore.14 We described the preva-
lence of FH in the study population separately and as a combined 
measure of definite and probable FH and then in prespecified sub-
groups based on age in decades, sex, obesity status, and race/ethnic-
ity. We used PROC SURVEYFREQ and SURVEYMEANS on each 
imputed data set to incorporate NHANES sampling weights for the 
complex sample design and to account for clusters and strata. PROC 
MIANALYZE was then used to combine results with adjusted vari-
ances on the 10 imputed data sets. Results were extrapolated to the 
US population using the Current Population Survey according to the 
NHANES analytic guidelines.15 Sensitivity analyses consisted of 
excluding the 2.4% who were nonfasting, varying the LDL-C multi-
plier for statin therapy to reflect low- and high-intensity statin/adher-
ence (1.21 and 1.63), restricting the analysis to those with available 
LDL-C (no imputed LDL-C values), assuming that missing family 
history of early ASCVD was “no” (n=15 210), or excluding those 
with missing family history of early ASCVD (n=9288).
Secondary Analysis
We conducted a secondary analysis to examine the prevalence of FH 
in adolescents 12 to 19 years of age. For this age group, FH was 
defined with the use of LDL-C ≥4.9 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) exclusive 
of other factors because personal and family history of early ASCVD 
and high cholesterol were not collected in NHANES participants 
12 to 19 years of age. FH prevalence was not calculated in younger 
children because LDL-C was not measured in NHANES participants 
<6 years of age and was available for only 14% of 6- to 11-year-
old participants. FH prevalence estimates in adolescents were calcu-
lated with 2 separate approaches to account for missing LDL-C level 
data: excluding those with missing LDL-C data from the prevalence 
estimate, thus assuming those with missing LDL-C were similar to 
those with LDL-C, or assuming that those with missing LDL-C had 
values <4.1 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) and thus did not meet the FH cri-
teria. Results of both approaches are presented. All analyses were 
performed with SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).

early ASCVD events (>50%); most reported receiving lipid-
lowering therapy (81%).
Prevalence of FH in the Adult US Population
The overall adult US prevalence of probable/definite FH in 
NHANES participants was 0.40% (95% confidence inter-
val [CI], 0.32–0.48) or 1 in 250 (95% CI, 1 in 311 to 209). 
Probable FH was estimated as affecting 0.38% (95% CI, 0.30–
0.45) or 1 in 267 (95% CI, 1 in 334 to 222), whereas definite 
FH prevalence was much less common, affecting 0.02% (95% 
CI, 0.01–0.04) or 1 in 4023 (95% CI, 1 in 15 652 to 2309) US 
adults. With extrapolation to the US population, 834 500 (95% 
CI, 834 300–834 600) adults ≥20 years of age had probable or 
definite FH. FH prevalence varied with age (Figure 1) but not 
by sex (Figure 2A). Criteria for probable/definite FH were met 
more commonly in obese (0.58%, 1 in 172) than nonobese 
(0.31%, 1 in 325) individuals (Figure 2B). FH prevalence 
also varied by race/ethnicity, being highest among whites, 
blacks, and other Hispanics (0.40%–0.58%) and lowest 
among Mexican Americans and other races (0.24%–0.29%; 
Figure 2C).
Missing Data
There were no statistically significant differences in whether 
LDL-C was missing by age (P=0.43), sex (P=0.83), per-
sonal history of early ASCVD (P=0.52), or family history of 
ASCVD (P=0.71). There were no significant differences in 
whether familial ASCVD was missing by age (P=0.30), sex 
(P=0.59), or personal history of early ASCVD (P=0.18). 
However, we found that respondents with missing famil-
ial ASCVD were more likely to be missing LDL-C values 
(60.3% versus 56.7%; P<0.001). We also found that LDL-C 
values were higher for those with missing familial ASCVD 
(β=4.9; SE=0.9; P<0.001).
Sensitivity Analyses
Sensitivity testing demonstrated similar effects when nonfast-
ing adult patients were excluded from the analysis (0.40%, 1 
in 249). Limiting the analysis to those with measured LDL-C 
with missing family history of early ASCVD, assumed to 
be absent family history, gave a lower prevalence (0.30%, 
1 in 337), as expected. Restricting to those with complete 
LDL-C and family history of early ASCVD gave a similar 
prevalence (0.38%, 1 in 264). Varying the effect of statins on 
LDL-C had the expected impact; smaller estimated LDL-C 
lowering of 1.21 (based on the effect seen with lower-inten-
sity statins)16 led to lower FH prevalence (0.19%, 1 in 532), 
whereas larger statin effects (1.63, representing the effects 
of higher-intensity statins)16 produced higher FH prevalence 
(0.85%, 1 in 121).
Secondary Analysis of Adolescent Participants
With the use of the LDL-C cut point of ≥4.9 mmol/L, US 
adolescents were affected by FH similarly to US adults at a 
rate of 0.42% (95% CI, 0.15–0.70) or 1 in 237 (95% CI, 1 
in 684 to 144). Excluding those with missing LDL-C data 
and assuming these adolescents had levels similar to those 
who had values measured resulted in similar prevalence esti-
mates. If the missing LDL-C levels were set to <4.1 mmol/L

Discussion
Using the DLC definition of FH in nationally representa-
tive sample, we estimated the US prevalence of FH to be 
1 in 250 adults. Our estimate is higher than the commonly 
reported prevalence of 1 in 500,17 which originated in selected, 
nonrepresentative populations. Our estimate is lower than 
recently reported European prevalence data,5 possibly as a 
result of founder effects in European populations and higher 
proportions in the United States of nonwhite racial/ethnic 
background, and it is in line with other recent prevalence 
estimates from Jiangsu, China (1 in 213)6 and from 2 large 
Australian data sets (1 in 353 to 229).4 The US FH prevalence 
estimates varied by race/ethnicity, from 1 in 414 in Mexican 
Americans to 1 in 174 in other Hispanics, supporting this as a 
potential explanation for our lower prevalence estimate com-
pared with more homogeneous populations.
With an FH definition based on LDL-C levels alone, the 
prevalence of FH in 12 to 17 year olds was estimated at 1 in 
237. Whereas our adolescent FH prevalence estimate aligns 
well with the overall US population estimate, it should be 
interpreted with caution. Our estimate was based solely on 
LDL-C levels because relevant family history was not col-
lected in NHANES participants <20 years of age. The ado-
lescent NHANES sample is smaller, and lipid levels differ by 
sex and change with pubertal stage, also contributing to uncer-
tainty in this pooled analysis.18 We were not able to include 
younger children because NHANES obtains few fasting lipid 
profiles in participants <12 years of age and none in those <6 
years of age. The prevalence of FH in the pediatric age range 
requires additional investigation.
The differences in FH prevalence estimates seen by age 
and obesity status are unexpected in an autosomal-dominant 
genetic disorder, but the differences in FH prevalence by age 
were also seen in the Jiangsu Province of China.6 Our find-
ings may reflect the effect of age or obesity on LDL-C as a 
result of enhanced penetrance with changing environmental

factors (eg, worsening lifestyle practices), unmasking of a 
milder genotype, or a physiological increase in LDL-C lev-
els caused by age or menopause. Which factor is salient has 
important prognostic implications; lifelong genetic dyslipid-
emias, even if mild, likely carry important long-term risks for 
ASCVD compared with dyslipidemias developed at later ages 
as a result of lifestyle factors. Our findings may also reflect 
higher rates of ASCVD events resulting from these known 
risk factors that then lead to higher DLC scores. This high-
lights the potential impact of lacking some DLC criteria in 
the NHANES data set, including genetic testing and physical 
examination findings, although physical findings are rare in 
contemporary cohorts.
The differences we report highlight the challenges of using 
a clinical definition to identify FH. We used adapted DLC cri-
teria2 in our main analysis of adults because they were the most 
appropriate for use in a general population.3,7 Other published 
FH definitions include the Make Early Diagnosis to Prevent 
Early Deaths (MEDPED) definition,19 which is designed pri-
marily for cascade screening, and the Simon Broome defini-
tion,20 which has not been used in a community-based sample. 
Both of these FH definitions require information that is criti-
cally missing from NHANES, namely family history of FH 
and degree of relatedness for MEDPED and first- or second-
degree relative with total cholesterol >290 mg/mL, xanthoma 
in the patient or a first-degree relative, and genetic information 
for Simon Broome.
Our inability to assess genetic criteria implies that our esti-
mate of FH prevalence underestimates the true prevalence of 
FH in the US population. We suspect that underestimating the 
FH prevalence as a result of the use of a clinical definition is 
especially relevant among young adults and nonobese individu-
als. The results of a Copenhagen population study demonstrate 
that when the DLC criteria are used, the combination of phe-
notype and genotype leads to a higher prevalence of FH than 
either alone.7 It is possible to estimate the magnitude of this 
underestimation in NHANES with the results reported by Benn 
et al.7 The DLC assign 8 points for a positive genetic test, which 
is sufficient for a definite diagnosis of FH, regardless of other 
criteria. In the Copenhagen sample, 20% of individuals with 
FH had a positive genetic test, and (by definition) all individu-
als without FH had a negative genetic test. Therefore, we can 
extrapolate that in this study genetic testing displayed a sensi-
tivity of 20% and a specificity of 100%. If we had been able to 
include the results of genetic testing, our estimate of prevalence 
may have increased by as much as 25%, if positive genetic 
tests were assumed to uniquely identify individuals with FH. 
If some individuals with positive genetic tests could have been 
diagnosed with definite/probable FH on the basis of clinical cri-
teria alone, then an intermediate value would be appropriate. 
Applying this logic, our study suggests that the prevalence of 
FH would fall between 0.40% (1 in 250) and 0.50% (1 in 200).
Genetic testing for FH is not a usual part of clinical prac-
tice in the United States, and the clinical implications of gen-
otype-positive/milder-phenotype FH are uncertain and require 
additional research. Additionally, our clinical definition could 
have identified familial combined hyperlipidemia or poly-
genic hypercholesterolemia with metabolic syndrome, along 
with FH. Without deeper phenotyping or genetic testing, we 
were not able to distinguish between the two, but these other 
lipid diagnoses are treated similarly to FH. Thus, our results 
can be viewed as an estimate of the prevalence of significant 
hyperlipidemias, if not confirmed FH per se, based on a clini-
cal definition that aligns well with general practice.
Limitations to this analysis, besides those related to the FH 
definition, include those inherent in the NHANES. ASCVD 
events and family history were collected as self-report, which 
makes them less reliable than adjudicated events. Analyzing 
multiple cross-sectional surveys in combination means that 
we could have measured the same individual twice. Although 
NHANES is a relatively large data set and FH is a common 
genetic disease, some subgroup analyses were based on few 
individuals, which limited the precision of our estimates (par-
ticularly in subgroups with <10 people). An important pro-
portion of the NANES sample reported treatment with statins 
(13%); we adjusted LDL-C levels upward for these partici-
pants using a correction factor derived from the literature. 
We chose to use the same correction factor for the effect of 
statins on LDL-C levels as used in Benn et al7 to allow easy 
comparison with other FH prevalence estimates. Although 
this correction factor was similar to published data,16,21 the 
upward adjustment could be excessive (imperfect adherence) 
or inadequate (high-potency statins), and sensitivity analy-
ses suggested that it was an influential assumption. Missing 
data could also have skewed our results with regard to fam-
ily history of early ASCVD because this question was not 
included in the survey before 2005, although we attempted 
to correct for this using multiple imputations. Use of multiple 
imputation was strengthened by the observation that when we 
examined for patterns in missing data, there were no signifi-
cant differences in missing LDL-C levels or family history 
of ASCVD by age, sex, or personal history of early ASCVD. 
Although missing LDL-C and familial ASCVD were related, 
the NHANES data set included other near-complete variables 
that were used for multiple imputation of each (eg, total cho-
lesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, personal history 
of early ASCVD). Thus, we felt comfortable assuming that 
familial ASCVD met the missing-at-random assumption.
With the use of an established DLC definition and a popu-
lation sample, these data estimate the US FH prevalence as 
higher than conventionally reported rates and provide the only 
nationally representative US data on this topic to date. FH is 
a life-shortening disease with safe and effective treatments if 
properly identified. Nonwhite populations appear affected by 
FH but at differential rates, and obesity and age influenced our 
prevalence estimates. Further investigation into the prevalence 
of FH, including diverse and pediatric populations and the use 
of genotype along with phenotype, will improve our under-
standing of the national burden of FH, an important cause of 
ASCVD.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal-dominant genetic cholesterol disorder associated with premature ath-
erosclerotic cardiovascular disease, with a reported ≈90-fold increase in premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 
in young adults. Because statins have been shown to lower low-density lipoprotein and to reduce the risk of heart attack in 
individuals with FH, interest in FH screening and statin use to reduce premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has 
grown. The population benefit of FH screening, however, depends on the US prevalence of FH, which remains unknown. 
Recent reports from mostly European populations suggest prevalences between 1 in 137 and 1 in 500. Applying a defini-
tion of FH modified from the Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria in nationally representative US data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Survey (NHANES), we estimated the prevalence of FH to be 1 in 250 (95% confidence interval, 1 in 311 to 209), 
suggesting that 834 500 US adults have FH. The FH prevalence was similar in men and women but varied by race/ethnicity, 
with whites and blacks being affected more frequently than Mexican Americans and individuals of other races. The estimated 
FH prevalence was also higher in older ages and in the presence of obesity, a finding not typical of an autosomal genetic 
disorder, suggesting possible worsening lifestyle practices, unmasking of a milder genotype, or a physiological increase in 
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels resulting from age or menopause. Genetic testing in a nationally representative 
sample would improve the accuracy of our FH prevalence estimates, which rely on clinical criteria.
