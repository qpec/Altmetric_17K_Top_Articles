Sustained high coverage with recommended vaccinations 
among children has kept many vaccine-preventable diseases 
at low levels in the United States (1). To assess coverage with 
vaccinations recommended for children by age 2 years in 
the United States (2), CDC analyzed data collected by the 
2015 National Immunization Survey (NIS) for children aged 
19–35 months (born January 2012–May 2014). Overall, cover-
age did not change during 2014–2015. Coverage in 2015 was 
highest for ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (93.7%), ≥3 doses 
of hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) (92.6%), ≥1 dose of measles, 
mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) (91.9%), and ≥1 dose 
of varicella vaccine (91.8%). The data were also examined 
for potential vaccination coverage differences by race/ethnic-
ity, poverty status, and urbanicity. Although disparities were 
noted for each of these factors, the most striking differences 
were seen for poverty status. Children living below the federal 
poverty level* had lower coverage with most of the vaccinations 
assessed compared with children living at or above the poverty 
level; the largest disparities were for rotavirus vaccine (66.8% 
versus 76.8%), ≥4 doses of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 
(PCV) (78.9% versus 87.2%), the full series of Haemophilus 
influenzae type b vaccine (Hib) (78.1% versus 85.5%), and 
≥4 doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine 
(DTaP) (80.2% versus 87.1%). Although coverage was high 
in some groups, opportunities exist to continue to address 
disparities. Implementation of evidence-based interventions, 
including strategies to enhance access to vaccination services 
and systems strategies that can reduce missed opportunities, 
has the potential to increase vaccination coverage for children 
living below the poverty level and in rural areas (3).
NIS monitors vaccination coverage among children aged 
19–35 months in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, 
selected local areas, and territories† using a random digit dial-
ing (RDD) sample of landline and cellular telephone numbers. 
After identifying a household with at least one age-eligible 
child, a telephone interview is conducted to collect sociodemo-
graphic characteristics for all age-eligible children and request 
permission to contact the child’s vaccination providers. If 
consent is given, a survey is mailed to each provider to request 
the child’s vaccination history, including dates of receipt of 
vaccine doses. All coverage estimates are based on provider-
reported vaccination histories. Details regarding NIS meth-
odology and weighting have been described previously.§ For 
2015, national vaccination coverage estimates were based on 
a sample of 15,167 children with completed household inter-
views and adequate provider data. The Council of American 
Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) response rate was 
34.9%.¶ Logistic regression was used to assess differences 
among racial/ethnic groups, controlling for poverty status, and 
to evaluate the potential interaction between poverty status 
and Metropolitan Statistical Area** (MSA) status (a measure 
of urbanicity). Statistical comparisons were made using t-tests 
on weighted data, taking into account the complex survey 
design. P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
National Vaccination Coverage
Nationally, coverage did not change during 2014–2015 for 
the vaccinations assessed, and the percentage of children who 
received no vaccinations remained <1% (Table 1). The Healthy 
People 2020†† target of 90% coverage was met for four vac-
cines: 1) ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine (93.7%), 2) ≥3 doses of

* Poverty level uses income and family size to categorize households into those 
1) at or above the poverty level, and 2) below the poverty level. Poverty level 
was based on 2014 U.S. Census poverty thresholds (http://www.census.gov/
hhes/www/poverty/data/threshold).
† The local areas sampled separately for the 2015 NIS included areas that receive 
federal Section 317 immunization funds and are included in the NIS sample 
every year (Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Philadelphia County, 
Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and Houston, Texas) and two additional 
sample areas (El Paso County, Texas and Hidalgo County, Texas). The 2015 
NIS was also conducted in Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands; 
these three territories were excluded from national coverage estimates.
 § Further details regarding the statistical methodology of NIS are available in 
the NIS User’s Guide 2014, which can be downloaded at http://www.cdc.
gov/nchs/nis/data_files.htm.
 ¶ The CASRO household response rate, calculated as the product of the 
resolution rate (percentage of the total telephone numbers called that were 
classified as nonworking, nonresidential, or residential), screening completion 
rate (percentage of known households that were successfully screened for the 
presence of age-eligible children), and the interview completion rate 
(percentage of households with one or more age-eligible children that 
completed the household survey) (http://www.casro.org). The CASRO 
response rate is equivalent to the American Association for Public Opinion 
Research (AAPOR) type 3 response rate (http://www.aapor.org/AAPOR_
Main/media/publications/Standard-Definitions20169theditionfinal.pdf). The 
15,167 children with adequate provider data in the 2015 NIS represent 56.2% 
of children with completed household interviews.
 
** Metropolitan Statistical Areas have at least one urbanized area of 50,000 or 
more population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and 
economic integration with the core as measured by commuting ties. The 
Office of Management and Budget published the Standards for Delineating 
Metropolitan Statistical Areas in 2010; current definitions are based on an 
update published in February of 2013 (https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/

HepB (92.6%), 3) ≥1 dose of MMR (91.9%), and 4) ≥1 dose 
of varicella vaccine (91.8%). Coverage remained below the 
target of 90% for ≥4 doses of DTaP (84.6%); the full series of 
Hib (82.7%), and ≥4 doses of PCV (84.1%); below the 85% 
target for ≥2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine (HepA) (59.6%) and 
the HepB birth dose§§ (72.4%); and below the 80% target for 
rotavirus vaccination (73.2%) and the combined seven-vaccine 
series¶¶ (72.2%).
Vaccination Coverage by Race/Ethnicity, Poverty 
Level, and MSA Status
Compared with non-Hispanic white*** (white) children, 
non-Hispanic black (black) children had lower coverage with 
the full series of Hib, ≥4 doses of PCV, and the rotavirus 
series (Table 2). Coverage differences between black and white 
children were not statistically significant after adjustment for 
poverty status (data not shown). Black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic 
Asian, and non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native chil-
dren had higher coverage with the HepB birth dose than did 
white children. Among Asian children, coverage with ≥4 doses 
of DTaP
, ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, ≥3 doses of HepB, 
the HepB birth dose, and ≥2 doses of HepA was higher than 
that for white children.
 
§§ The Healthy People 2020 target for the birth dose (0–3 days) of HepB is 85%, 
measured by annual birth cohort. For the three most recent completed birth 
cohorts examined by NIS, coverage with the birth dose of HepB was 71.8% 
for children born in 2010, 73.2% for children born in 2011, and 73.3% for 
children born in 2012.
 
¶¶ The combined seven-vaccine series (4:3:1:3*:3:1:4) includes ≥4 doses of DTaP/
diphtheria and tetanus toxoids vaccine/diphtheria, tetanus toxoids, and 
pertussis vaccine; ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine; ≥1 dose of measles-containing 
vaccine; ≥3 or ≥4 doses of Hib (depending upon product type of vaccine); 
≥3 doses of HepB; ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine; and ≥4 doses of PCV.

Children living below the federal poverty level had lower 
coverage with nearly all vaccines compared with children living 
at or above the poverty level (Table 2). As in 2014, coverage 
with ≥4 doses of DTaP
, ≥3 doses of poliovirus vaccine, ≥1 dose 
of MMR, the primary and full series of Hib, ≥4 doses of PCV, 
≥2 doses of HepA, the rotavirus series and the combined seven-
vaccine series was lower among children below the poverty 
level. The difference in coverage levels ranged from 2.6 to 
10.0 percentage points; for five vaccines/doses (≥4 doses of 
DTaP
, the full series of Hib, ≥4 doses of PCV, ≥2 doses of 
HepA, the rotavirus series) and the combined seven-vaccine 
series, the disparity exceeded 5.0 percentage points.
Coverage differed by MSA status for several vaccines in 
2015 (Table 2). Children living in a non-MSA had lower 
coverage with ≥3 doses of DTaP
, ≥3 doses of poliovirus 
vaccine, ≥1 dose of varicella vaccine, ≥4 doses of PCV, 
≥2 doses of HepA, and rotavirus vaccine than did children 
in an MSA central city. Logistic regression analyses did not 
identify any statistically significant interaction between 
poverty status and MSA status for any of the vaccines 
monitored by NIS. In all cases, poverty status remained 
independently associated with vaccination coverage after 
adjustment for MSA status.

Vaccination Coverage by Geographic Area
Vaccination coverage in 2015 varied considerably by geo-
graphic area (Table 3), differing across states by as much as 
38.1 percentage points. Coverage with ≥1 dose of MMR 
ranged from 83.4% (Virginia) to 97.5% (Connecticut). The 
lowest estimated coverage with ≥4 doses of DTaP was 76.4% 
(Arkansas) and the highest was 92.0% (Maine). The largest 
discrepancy among states was for the HepB birth dose, with a 
low of 49.4% (Vermont) and a high of 87.5% (North Dakota). 
Coverage with ≥2 doses of HepA varied widely, ranging 
from 41.2% (Mississippi) to 72.8% (Nebraska). The lowest 
state-specific estimate for rotavirus series coverage was 63.8% 
(Florida) and the highest 87.6% (Rhode Island). Coverage 
with the combined seven-vaccine series ranged from 64.4% 
(Virginia) to 80.6% (Connecticut).
Discussion
Nationally, coverage with vaccines recommended by the 
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
for children aged 19–35 months remains high and stable. 
The burden of most vaccine-preventable diseases is low in 
this population. Furthermore, Healthy People 2020 coverage 
targets continue to be met for poliovirus vaccine, MMR, 
HepB, and varicella vaccine. For other vaccines, coverage 
levels remained stable, and increased activities are needed to 
reach target coverage levels. Nationally, large disparities in 
coverage exist for children living below the poverty level com-
pared with children living at or above the poverty level, with 
differences of 7–10 percentage points for ≥4 doses of DTaP
, 
Hib (full series), ≥4 doses of PCV, and rotavirus vaccination. 
Disparities between racial/ethnic groups were observed, but

these diminished in magnitude when poverty status and MSA 
were accounted for in the analysis.
The widespread, persistent and often sizeable vaccination 
coverage disparities between children living below poverty 
and children living at or above the poverty level have been 
observed for many vaccines monitored by NIS since at least 
2009 and are concerning. Based on 2015 data, an estimated 
32.9% (95% CI = 31.4%–34.4%) of U.S. children aged 
19–35 months were living below the poverty level. The 
Vaccines for Children (VFC) program††† has provided free 
vaccine to many uninsured, Medicaid-eligible and other chil-
dren aged ≤18 years who would otherwise have less access to 
these important vaccines. The extent to which parents and 
guardians of children living in poverty are aware of the VFC 
program or face barriers to participation in it is not known. The 
Affordable Care Act (ACA) stipulates that ACIP-recommended 
vaccines be made available to insured children with no copay-
ments or other cost-sharing requirements when administered 
by an in-network provider. Issues such as proximity to health 
care providers and clinics, transportation, and convenience 
of clinic hours also should be investigated and addressed, if 
needed. Breaks in insurance enrollment (especially Medicaid) 
are another complication faced by families living below the 
poverty level that might have a negative effect on their ability 
to access the medical care system in general (4).
Widespread geographic variation in coverage levels was evi-
dent in the ranges of coverage estimates by state and local area, 
as well as differences by MSA status. Children in more rural 
(non-MSA) areas had lower coverage with DTaP
, poliovirus 
vaccine, varicella vaccine, PCV, HepA, and rotavirus vaccine 
than did more urban (MSA central city) children. This also 
could reflect issues of access and proximity to vaccination 
providers, including those who administer VFC vaccines.
Evidence-based interventions such as those recommended in 
The Guide to Community Preventive Services (3) can contribute 
to addressing the poverty and urbanicity gaps in vaccination 
coverage. Enhancing access to vaccination services might include 
conducting home vaccination visits, holding extended office/
clinic hours during the week or on weekends, and establishing 
vaccination programs in organized child care centers and in 
settings where the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for 
Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) is administered.
Overall, MMR coverage remained within the 92%–95% 
range generally considered adequate for herd immunity for 
all three diseases (5); however, coverage levels of <90% were 
observed in several states and local areas as well as in the U.S. 
Virgin Islands. In the era of VFC, the number of cases of 
measles has dropped substantially, to only 49 in the United 
States in 2016 (through July 30) (6). Despite high coverage, 
outbreaks continue to occur, demonstrating that pockets of sus-
ceptibility to this highly contagious disease remain. Reductions 
in rotavirus-related morbidity have been observed in the United 
States after vaccine introduction, and indirect (herd) effects 
of vaccination might have contributed to the decline (7). 
Additional activities are needed to increase rotavirus coverage 
as demonstrated by the relatively low overall coverage, large 
disparity by poverty, and state variation in vaccination rates. 
Increased rotavirus vaccination coverage is needed to decrease 
further the overall prevalence of rotavirus gastroenteritis.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations, each of which could lead to bias in estimates

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Vaccination has resulted in substantial reductions in morbidity 
and mortality from childhood diseases in the United States. As 
new vaccines, such as varicella, pneumococcal conjugate, and 
rotavirus have been recommended by the Advisory Committee 
on Immunization Practices, the National Immunization Survey 
(NIS) has been able to provide important information on 
vaccine coverage among U.S. children aged 19–35 months and 
on progress toward meeting coverage targets.

The 2015 NIS data reveal no significant changes in overall 
coverage relative to the previous year. More than 90% of 
children were up to date on vaccination against polio; hepatitis 
B; measles, mumps, and rubella; and varicella. However, children 
living below the poverty level continued to have lower 
coverage with rotavirus vaccine; pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine; Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine; and diphtheria, 
tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine. In addition, children 
living in more rural areas had lower coverage with diphtheria, 
tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine; poliovirus vaccine; 
varicella vaccine; pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, hepatitis A 
vaccine; and rotavirus vaccine.
What are the implications for public health practice?
CDC will continue to work with state immunization programs 
through ongoing site visits, teleconferences, and structured 
interviews to identify reasons for the observed disparities in 
vaccination coverage by poverty status and to implement 
effective strategies to eliminate them. Effort is needed to ensure 
full participation in the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program for 
eligible children who could benefit from it. Supporting the 
continued development of state and local immunization 
information systems to monitor vaccination coverage can help 
identify areas of undervaccination that might not be easily 
detected by the national monitoring program. Identifying areas 
of need and responding with evidence-based interventions will 
allow continued progress in protecting young children against 
vaccine-preventable diseases.

of vaccination coverage (8). First, response rates were low. 
Second, the telephone sample frame did not cover the entire 
target population. Bias from incomplete sample frame and 
nonresponse may remain after weighting adjustments. Finally, 
ascertainment of the vaccination status may be incomplete. A 
total survey error model, including potential underascertain-
ment of vaccinations reported by providers, indicated that 
some NIS estimates might be too low by about five percentage 
points (9). However, a recent analysis demonstrated no evi-
dence of substantial change in bias in NIS during the period 
1995–2013 (10).
NIS continues to provide valuable national and state level 
data. In addition, it is important that states continue to 
obtain local level coverage data useful for identifying pockets 
of under-vaccinated children. This analysis documents high 
overall coverage and, importantly, lower coverage in rural 
and poorer populations. Continued surveillance is needed 
to monitor coverage, locate pockets of susceptibility, and 
evaluate the impact of interventions designed to ensure that 
all children remain adequately protected against vaccine-
preventable diseases. More widespread implementation of 
evidence-based interventions is needed to bring about con-
tinued improvement in vaccination coverage among infants 
and young children in the United States. Financial barriers to 
vaccine purchase itself are addressed for children living below 
the poverty level by the VFC program and vaccine-related 
stipulations in the ACA. Improved access might be achieved 
through establishment of vaccination programs in child care 
centers and in WIC settings. Systems-based interventions, 
such as patient reminder and recall systems, provider remind-
ers, establishment of standing orders for vaccination, and 
further development of immunization information systems 
might be useful in improving vaccination coverage among 
all young children in the United States.
