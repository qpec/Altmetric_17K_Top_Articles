Abstract
Introduction—Lung cancer screening (LCS) with low dose computed tomography (LDCT) 
reduces mortality and is recommended for high-risk current and former smokers. Several potential 
harms associated with LCS have been identified, including the potential for psychological burden. 
To summarize the current state of the scientific knowledge on psychological burden associated 
with LCS, we performed a systematic search of the contemporary quantitative and qualitative 
research literature.
Methods—We included randomized controlled trials and cohort studies that evaluated the impact 
of LCS with LDCT on psychological burden and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) as 
assessed by validated and non-validated measures. PubMed, CINAHL, PsychINFO, and Scopus 
were searched for English language articles published between 2004 and January 2015. Data 
abstraction and quality assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers.
Results—Thirteen studies were included that met our inclusion criteria. Overall, results were 
variable with some studies reporting worse psychological burden for patients with indeterminate 
results at pre-screening, post-screening and short-term follow-up (<6 months post-screen). These 
adverse effects diminished or resolved at long-term follow-up (>6 months post-screen).
Conclusion—LCS may be associated with short-term adverse psychological burden, particularly 
after a false positive result. However, these adverse effects diminished over time. The current 
evidence is small, with limitations in study design and use of outcome measures. More high-
quality research is needed to determine the frequency, duration, and overall magnitude of LCS-
related psychological burden in non-clinical trial settings.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality for both men and women in the United 
States and worldwide.1 An estimated 158,040 Americans will die from lung cancer in 2015, 
more than colon, breast, and pancreatic cancers combined.2 Compared to other leading 
cancer sites such as colon and breast, which have better outcomes due to successful 
screening, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is only 16.6%.3 In contrast, the ten-year 
survival of screen-detected lung cancers may be as high as 88%.4 The National Lung 
Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated that annual low-dose radiation computed tomography 
(LDCT) scans for three years improved lung cancer mortality by 20% when compared to 
chest x-ray.5 This finding has led the US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) and a 
number of professional medical organizations, including the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS), to support LCS with LDCT in high risk current and former 
smokers.6–8
One of the risks of LCS highlighted by most screening guidelines is the potential for 
psychological burden, such as anxiety related to false positive or, synonymously, 
indeterminate results.9 Screening may result in anxiety and psychological distress, which 
can potentially impact more multidimensional outcomes such as overall health-related 
quality of life (HRQOL). Psychological burden can potentially occur at various time points 
throughout the screening process (before screening, after screening while waiting for screen 
results, after a positive result, after a positive workup), and can vary by severity (mild to 
severe).10 Twenty-four percent of patients undergoing LDCT in NLST had pulmonary 
nodules identified, although 96% of these were benign. While advances in nodule 
management such as Lung Imaging Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) have 
minimized the number of positive studies to 10%, the high rate of false positive exams 
suggests that many patients are at risk for screen-related distress. However, the magnitude, 
duration, frequency, and trajectory of LCS-related psychological burden is largely unclear. 
Therefore, we performed a systematic search of the contemporary research literature to 
summarize the current state of the scientific knowledge on psychological burden associated 
with LCS. We focused on gathering information on the number of published studies and 
select study characteristics, including follow-up period and findings. Special attention was 
given to describing the type of outcome measures used to assess psychological burden in 
each study. Finally, we classified study findings on the potential impact of LCS on 
psychological burden pre-screen (baseline) and post-screen (short-and long-term).

 Materials and Methods
Search Strategy
The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines 
(PRISMA) were followed for this review.11 We conducted a systematic literature search 
using PubMed, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Scopus electronic databases. In an effort to more 
efficiently identify relevant studies that reflect the most current practices in LCS with LDCT, 
we restricted our search to English language articles published in the last 10 years between 
January 2004 and January 2015. A research librarian with experience and expertise in cancer 
worked with the authors to develop a list of terms and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) to 
further refine the search procedures. Key words included psychology, psychosocial, 
psychiatric, quality of life, distress, depression, anxiety, fear, risk perception, lung, early 
detection of cancer, cancer screening, and neoplasm (search strategies for the databases are 
available on request).
Review Process
Inclusion criteria for articles in the final full-text review included the following: 1) report 
results of an empirical study, 2) relate to LCS using LDCT, and 3) present findings on 
patient self-report of psychological burden and related outcomes (eg HRQOL, psychological 
distress, depression). We chose to include studies that utilized both validated and non-
validated outcome measures of psychological burden to examine the impact of selected 
measures on study findings. All other studies that did not meet the criteria described were 
excluded, including case reports, commentaries, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Two 
authors (GW, VS) independently reviewed all titles and abstracts from the initial search and 
reached agreement on whether selected abstracts should be retained. Where discrepancies 
occurred, the titles and abstracts were reviewed and discussed collectively until consensus 
was reached. Full text versions of the articles retained from the initial review were obtained. 
The full-text articles were reviewed by two authors (GW, VS) independently. The 
bibliography of each reviewed article was also perused for other relevant studies. Consensus 
was reached on articles that should be included in the final full text review.
Data Abstraction
Study characteristics from articles that met the inclusion criteria and selected through the 
two-stage review process were obtained. One author (VS) recorded the following details of 
each included study: year, location, patient population, sample size, study design, screening 
procedure and results, outcome measures, and key findings. A second author (GW) reviewed 
all abstractions for verification, completeness, and accuracy. Any discrepancies between 
reviewers were resolved by further discussions until a consensus was reached. Selected 
articles were further classified based on timing of outcome assessment. Outcome measures 
recorded less than 6 months after initial screening were considered short-term impact of 
LCS whereas those taken 6 months or more after screening were considered long-term 
impact of LCS.

 Results
Figure 1 presents the flow diagram that outlines the approach for stepwise selection of 
articles included in the final full-text review. From an initial total of 2,113 articles, 13 studies 
that assessed the psychological burden of LCS and met the inclusion criteria were selected 
for review. Study characteristics of the 13 reviewed articles are summarized in Table 1. The 
majority of studies were derived from three large randomized controlled trials evaluating the 
utility of LDCT for LCS. Five studies were based from Denmark, Belgium, and the 
Netherlands as part of the NELSON trial which compared LDCT with no screening in 
current or former smokers (quit less than 10 years) aged 50 to 75 who smoked more than 15 
cigarettes/day for more than 25 years, or more than 10 cigarettes/day for more than 30 
years.12 One study was based from the NLST which recruited participants between 55 and 
74 years of age with at least a 30 pack-year smoking history and if a former smoker, had quit 
within 15 years, and randomized patients to LDCT or chest radiography.13 Another four 
studies were derived from the Dutch Lung Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) which 
compared LDCT to no screening for 5 rounds and included current and former smokers (quit 
after age 50 and <10 years prior) aged 50-70 years with 20 or more pack-years.14
Table 1 presents study characteristics and findings from the articles included in the final full 
text review. Three articles included in our review were based on cohort studies evaluating 
LCS. One study was derived from the Pittsburg Lung Screening study (PLuSS) which 
included a cohort of 50-79 year-old current and former smokers (quit within 10 years) who 
smoked more than a half pack a day for more than 25 years and were screened with LDCT. 
Vierriko et al. evaluated the psychological burden of using spiral chest CT for LCS in 633 
asbestos-exposed workers from Finland with variable smoking history. Lastly, 60 individuals 
with extensive family history of lung cancer (three blood relatives with lung cancer with at 
least one first degree relative) who underwent spiral CT for LCS were surveyed regarding 
their risk perception and concern for lung cancer before and after the process.
Baseline (Pre-Screen) Psychological Burden
Most studies measured baseline pre-screen anxiety and demonstrated varied results. With the 
exception of NLST HRQOL study participants who were more likely to be female, white, 
more educated, and unmarried compared to controls15, the screening groups of the 
remaining studies did not differ significantly in patient characteristics from control 
groups.16–20 Pre-screen assessments from the NELSON trial (T0 = pre-randomization; T1 = 
post-randomization screening group) did not demonstrate statistically significant differences 
among subjects who eventually received negative CT scan results and those who eventually 
received indeterminate results in all measures of HRQOL, general anxiety, and lung cancer 
specific distress.18 At T1, screening group subjects had HRQOL and general anxiety scores 
that were comparable to those of the Dutch general population.17 However, all respondents 
had certain HRQOL scores that were significantly worse after randomization than before 
(P<0.05 for EQ-5D, P<0.001 for STAI 6 and IES).18 In addition, a subset of patients who 
reported most discomfort while awaiting screening results had significantly worse lung 
cancer specific distress at randomization than those that found other aspects of CT scanning 
most discomforting.17 When baseline perceived risk was evaluated in the NELSON trial

 population, 14.6% (n = 47/324) of participants reported high affective risk 1 day before 
screening and these participants had significantly worse measures of lung cancer-specific 
distress and general HRQOL than those in the low affective risk group (p<0.01).21 In a 
separate study on the same patient population, it was concluded that pre-screen informed 
decision-making, defined as adequate knowledge and a positive attitude toward LCS, had no 
effect on any measures of HRQOL except a better mental component score for those who 
made an informed decision (p=0.003).19 In the United States, NLST screened and control 
participants did not report significant differences in baseline HRQOL and anxiety 
measures.15
Rasmussen et al. reported that DLCST participants in the control group had significantly 
worse psychosocial consequences when compared to the screened group at baseline 
(p<0.022).22 Another study comparing DLCST participants to a sample of the general 
population at baseline found significantly higher negative psychosocial scores in the latter 
group in all psychological burden measures. This was attributed to significant differences 
between the trial participants and a comparable population control, including more women, 
higher socio-economic status, longer education, higher employment rate, and more central 
urban location in the trial group.23 In contrast, two separate DLCST-based studies evaluated 
trial participants and equivalent general population controls at baseline and found no 
statistically significant differences in the outcomes measures utilized, including 
consequences of screening (COS)16 and use of anxiolytics or antidepressants.20
A study derived from the PLuSS demonstrated lower baseline anxiety and fear of cancer in 
individuals who were eventually found to have a suspicious screening result compared to 
those who eventually received an indeterminate or negative result.24 In a population at high-
risk for lung cancer (based on family history), 64-74% had high pre-screen lung cancer risk 
perception and 94% of participants reported thoughts and concerns about developing lung 
cancer that did not affect mood or interfere with daily activity.25 One third of asbestos 
workers undergoing LCS thought that they were at risk for lung cancer at baseline. 
Additionally, baseline anxiety was higher in the false positive group than in the negative 
group.26
Short-Term (Immediate and <6 Months Post-Screen) Psychological Burden
Short-term (immediate post-screen and <6 months) LCS-related psychological burden also 
varied by trial and screening results. The NLST did not demonstrate significant difference in 
HRQOL or anxiety among LCS participants that received false positive, significant 
incidental or negative results at 1 month after screening. However, patients who had true 
positives had lower scores on the mental component aspect of the SF-36 compared to 
baseline (OR 3.95 CI -5.87, -2.04 p<0.001), which signified worse anxiety, as well as higher 
STAI ratio (OR 1.47 CI 1.16–1.88, p<0.01), or worse HRQOL, than those with false 
positive, incidental, and negative results.15 The NELSON trial reported that 46.4% of 
participants reported discomfort and 50.5% reported dread or fear while waiting for results, 
and this subgroup had significantly worse measures of HRQOL and lung cancer-specific 
distress as measured by STAI-6 and IES, respectively (P<0.01). In addition, 76% of 
respondents reported the most discomfort while awaiting CT scan results, and had worse

 STAI-6 and IES scores immediately post-screen compared with those who reported most 
discomfort with other aspects of CT scanning (p<0.05 and <0.01, respectively).17 In a 
separate study from the same trial, there was no significant difference immediately post-
screening in any measures of HRQOL or anxiety between the negative and indeterminate 
result groups. However at 2 months follow up, participants with indeterminate results had 
higher IES scores, indicating worse lung cancer specific distress than in the negative result 
group (P<0.01). In the negative result group, IES scores improved at two months compared 
to post-screen and to baseline scores (P<0.01 for both). In the indeterminate group, EQ-5D 
scores measuring HRQOL and IES scores worsened at 2 months compared to post-screen 
and baseline scores (P<0.01 for both). Likewise, STAI-6 scores suggested increased anxiety 
from baseline to 2 months in those with indeterminate results (P<0.05).18
Similar short-term findings were reported from the PLuSS cohort that demonstrated 
increased general anxiety measures with indeterminate or suspicious screening results 
immediately following and up to 1 month after screening. Fear of cancer scores (PCQ) 
increased after LDCT for screenees with suspicious results and were relatively unchanged 
for the negative or indeterminate groups. Perceived risk of cancer decreased in short-term 
follow up for those with negative screen results and increased for those with indeterminate 
or suspicious results. For all categories, perceived risk of cancer was higher than objective 
risk. However, perceived risk of cancer was accurately estimated to be high by those who 
had a suspicious screening result, while the negative and intermediate groups estimated 
much higher perceived risk than their actual objective risk. Additionally, higher education 
and married status were associated with lower anxiety while current smoking status was 
associated with higher anxiety. Current smokers and women experienced higher fear of 
cancer whereas the opposite was true for those with higher education.24 Similarly, for 
subjects undergoing screening for extensive family history of lung cancer, short-term 
evaluation at 1 month after screening demonstrated increased levels of worry, concern and 
perceived risk of cancer.25 In contrast, asbestos workers who received a negative or false 
positive LDCT screening result experienced decreased anxiety (p<0.001) compared to 
baseline. There were also no differences in post-screening perceived risk of or worry for 
lung cancer among participants with negative or false positive results.26
Long-Term (>6 Months Post-Screen) Psychological Burden
Long-term adverse psychological burden of LCS was reduced or absent in most studies. At 6 
months follow-up, only NLST HRQOL participants who received true positive results had 
worse HRQOL and anxiety measures from baseline. There was no difference in HRQOL or 
anxiety among the negative, false positive, or significant incidental finding groups from 
baseline to 6 months after screening.15
HRQOL and anxiety also did not change 6 months after baseline for participants in the 
NELSON trial and were not significantly different between the negative and indeterminate 
groups.17 Long-term assessment of lung cancer specific distress in low and high perceived 
risk groups showed that although IES scores were significantly lower at 6 months than at 
baseline for both groups, the high affective risk group had worse IES scores than the low 
affective risk group (p<0.01). However, there were significantly fewer subjects in the high

 affective risk group at 6 months than at pre-screen baseline.21 At 2 years, HRQOL and 
anxiety scores were not different between screen and control groups and any discrepancies 
in IES scores between indeterminate and negative result groups had resolved to baseline 
levels by the second round of screening.27 Long term follow up of PLuSS subjects at 6 
months demonstrated that the short-term increase in anxiety in the indeterminate group had 
resolved and that the elevated perceived risk and fear of cancer experienced by those with 
suspicious screening results had diminished.24 By 6 months after screening, the same return 
to baseline of short-term increased worry, concern and perceived risk occurred in high risk 
screenees with extensive family history of lung cancer.25 In the screened population of 
asbestos workers, no significant long-term psychological differences were identified based 
on screening result.26
In assessing long-term psychosocial consequences of screening in DLCST participants, one 
study found significant increases in COS-LC scales in both control and screening groups 1 
year after baseline CT. In addition, while no significant differences in COS-LC measures 
were found between the control and screen group at baseline, there were several significant 
differences in scores for anxiety, dejection, and self-blame at 1 year with the control group 
scoring worse than the screening group. This may be attributed to the significantly higher 
response rate of participants in the screening group (97%) compared to that of the control 
group (91.8%) in the prevalence screening round after randomization (p<0.0001), or to the 
fact that individuals with false positive results were excluded from analysis.16 Rasmussen et 
al. also reported significant increases in COS-LC scores for behavior, dejection, and poor 
sleep for both the screen and control groups after each annual screening up to 4 years. 
However, by years 3 and 4 (screening rounds 4 and 5), the scores for the screening group 
were closer to baseline. In general, the control group reported significantly worse 
psychosocial consequences compared to the screening group at all 5 rounds over 4 years. 
The control group also had more lung-cancer-specific negative psychosocial consequences 
compared to the screen group at 1, 2, and 4 years.22 Lastly, there was no difference in the 
use of anxiolytics or antidepressants after 3-year follow-up between the screen and control 
groups in this trial population.20
Outcome Measures Utilized
The selected articles utilized both validated and non-validated measures that were either 
general or condition-specific. Some studies used interviews to assess the effects of LCS on 
anxiety, fear, or worry of screening procedures, false positive results, and perceived risk. 
Outcome measures are summarized in Table 2 and include: the European Quality of Life 
(EQ-5D) with the visual analogue scale (VAS) for ranking self-impression of health; the 
two-component 36-item Short Form questionnaire (SF-36) with its shorter version the 
SF-12, both of which measure generic HRQOL (MCS = mental component summary and 
PCS = physical component summary); the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-20 and 
STAI-6) with 20 and 6 questions, respectively, that measure generic anxiety; the impact of 
event scale (IES) which measures lung cancer specific distress; the consequences of 
screening (COS) and the lung-cancer-specific consequences of screening in Lung Cancer 
(COS-LC) which was developed and validated in the NELSON trial and the Dutch Lung 
Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) and assesses the psychological burden of LCS 22,28; the

 Psychological Consequences Questionnaire (PCQ) adapted from a validated measure in 
breast cancer screening to measure lung cancer fear.
Discussion
This systematic review identified and reviewed 13 studies that examined the impact of LCS 
on psychological burden. Ten of the studies were derived from three large randomized 
control trials evaluating the efficacy of LCS (NELSON, NLST, DLCST) while three studies 
reported psychological outcomes in smaller cohorts undergoing LCS (PLuSS, asbestos 
workers, individuals with lung cancer family history). Collectively, the current scientific 
evidence suggests that LCS has the potential to cause short-term psychological burden in 
individuals with an indeterminate scan result, although the adverse effects do not appear to 
persist long-term. This is in contrast to the current evidence in mammography screening for 
breast cancer, where indeterminate results requiring further investigation resulted in short-
term increased anxiety which persisted long-term for up to three years.29,30 Additionally, 
most of the reviewed studies did not report differences in psychological burden among 
individuals with false positive and true negative results. In some cases, a negative result led 
to decreased distress and anxiety while a true positive resulted in increased anxiety and 
worse HRQOL.15,26 Furthermore, individuals with indeterminate or suspicious results who 
endorsed high perceived risk of lung cancer or who experienced the most discomfort while 
waiting for CT screening results had increased anxiety, lung cancer-specific distress, and 
fear of lung cancer.17,21,24
There are several characteristics to the current body of evidence that warrants further 
discussion. First, our search yielded a small total number of studies evaluating psychological 
burden in LCS. This may perhaps be a result of the perception that psychological burden is 
trivial compared to the potential physical harms from screening, or the lack of a clear 
conceptual framework to guide high-quality studies on LCS-related psychological burden. 
Harris and colleagues recently proposed a framework to guide research examining the 
potential harms associated with LCS. The framework includes four key domains: physical 
harm, psychological harm, financial strain, and opportunity costs.31 Psychological harm, as 
proposed within this framework, can potentially occur at any step of the “screening 
cascade,” but may be heightened at specific timepoints, such as receiving scan results or 
undergoing additional workup for a positive screen.31,32 Development and further 
refinement of conceptual frameworks on the psychological burden of LCS can potentially 
yield more high-quality evidence in future research.
The majority of studies selected in our review were conducted in the context of clinical trials 
that evaluated the effectiveness of LCS, comparing outcomes between screened versus 
nonscreened populations. Although these studies provide some evidence on LCS-related 
psychological burden, the findings may be biased because trial participation itself may have 
psychological effects.32 Furthermore, characteristics of trial participants are usually different 
from community nonparticipants; therefore the true magnitude of psychological burden may 
not be fully detected. Another important factor to consider is the context of the screening 
situation. Current recommendations are focused on screening high risk populations of 
current and former smokers. These individuals may already be experiencing feelings of

 guilt, shame, and anxiety based on factors such as perceived risk of developing lung 
cancer.31 Only six studies from our review included the assessment of these potential 
moderating factors.
Another important characteristic in our selected studies is the heterogeneity in outcome 
measures utilized to capture psychological burden. The majority of measures used were 
general rather than condition-specific. The use of general measures of psychological burden 
and HRQOL alone may not be as responsive to the subtle changes in psychological burden 
as condition-specific measures.10 There are few condition-specific measures in LCS with 
strong psychometric properties, with the exception of the COS-LC, which was used 
primarily in the European LCS trials. The addition of a more condition-specific measure 
may have resulted in differences in psychological burden outcomes in the European and US 
trials in our review. There is a need to develop and refine condition-specific psychological 
burden measures that are reliable and relevant to LCS populations.
The current Medicare coverage guidelines put forth by the Center for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) includes a counseling and shared decision-making visit on the 
benefits and potential harms of LCS. Extensive counseling on LCS harms is a potentially 
promising strategy to decrease short-term psychological burden associated with LCS. 
Analysis of HRQOL and state anxiety data from the NLST study revealed no differences in 
these outcomes by screen-results (false-positive, true-positive, significant incidental 
findings), which the authors attributed partially to the extensive counseling that trial 
participants received.15 Quality counseling and shared decision-making can be guided by 
tools such as patient decision aids, which are designed to help individuals participate in 
complex decision-making related to health care options and to improve decision quality.33 
Decision aids prepare patients to make informed, value-based decisions by providing quality 
information on the options available in easily understandable formats and coaching patients 
on communicating personal value to providers.33 As demand for LCS with LDCT increases, 
the provision of high quality information on the benefits and harms of screening is needed to 
promote informed decision-making, eliminate misperceptions, and reduce screen-related 
psychological burden.
Our review has some limitations. First, the small body of literature limits the ability to 
comment on the quality of data currently available. Second, our review focused only on 
psychological burden in the context of LCS; therefore, the findings may not be generalizable 
to other cancer screening settings. Finally, as previously discussed, our review yielded 
primarily studies that were conducted in an LCS clinical trial context; therefore, findings 
may be biased and not generalizable to non-participants.
In summary, based on our review, LCS did not appear to have substantial long-term impact 
on psychological burden, but potential short-term psychological burden was observed. More 
high-quality research conducted in non-clinical trial settings are needed to determine the 
frequency, duration, and overall magnitude of psychological burden associated with LCS.

Description
Subcategories
Range
36-item short form 
questionnaire (SF- 36)[1–3]
Generic HRQoL
36-question survey used to derive 8 
profiles of functional health
Physical component score (PCS): measures the absence of 
physical limitations, disability or decrease in well-being and 
energy level (physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain, 
general health)
0-100
Higher score indicates 
better
HRQoL
12-item short form 
questionnaire (SF- 12)[4, 5]
Generic HRQoL
Shorter version of SF-36
Mental component score (MCS) measures the absence of 
psychological distress and limitations in usual social/role activities 
because of emotional problems (Vitality, Social Functioning, 
Role-Emotional, and Mental Health)
European quality of life 
(EQ-5D)[6, 7]
Generic HRQoL
5 questions that assess mobility, self care, 
usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/
depression
Rate own health on visual analogue scale (VAS)
0–100
Higher score indicates 
better
HRQoL
State-trait anxiety inventory 
(STAI- 20/6)[8, 9]
Generic anxiety
20 questions assessing state anxiety, 20 
items in trait anxiety
State anxiety: unpleasant emotional arousal in face of threatening 
demands and dangers
20–80
6 questions related to anxiety: calm, tense, 
upset, relaxed, content, worried
Trait anxiety: existence of stable individual differences in 
tendency to respond with anxiety when anticipating a threatening 
situation
Higher score indicates 
greater anxiety
Impact of event scale (IES)
[10]
Lung cancer- specific 
distress
15 questions tailored assess lung cancer as 
a specific stressor.
Avoidance and intrusion
0–75
Higher score indicates 
more cancer specific 
distress
Consequences of screening 
(COS) and consequences of 
screening in Lung Cancer 
(COS-LC)[11]
Psychosocial 
consequences in 
screening and 
specifically lung 
cancer screening
4 core scales (anxiety, sense of dejection, 
negative impact on behavior, sleep), 2 
single questions (busy to take mind of 
tings, less interest in sex)
5 LCS2 specific scales (focus on airway 
symptoms, introvert, stigmatization, harm 
of smoking, self-blame)
Part I: psychosocial aspects relevant for potential screening 
participants
Part II: applicable for participants after final diagnosis (screen 
group only)
Higher score indicates 
more negative psychosocial 
consequences
Psychological Consequences 
Questionnaire (PCQ)[12, 13]
Fear of lung cancer 
(nonvalidated)
Adapted from validated questionnaire to 
assess emotional, social, and physical 
consequences of breast screening
1
Are you afraid that you may have cancer?
2
Does the thought of death from lung cancer scare 
you?
3
Are you afraid of dying soon from lung cancer?
Higher score indicates 
greater fear of lung cancer
1Health-related quality of life
*Based on validated questionnaire of psychological consequences of mammography screening in breast cancer.
