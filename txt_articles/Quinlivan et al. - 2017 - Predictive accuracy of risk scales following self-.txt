 Self-harm presentations to hospital emergency departments are
common and have serious consequences.1,2 In the UK, the risk
of suicide has been reported to be approximately 50 times greater
for patients in the year after a self-harm episode compared with
the general population.3 It may be even higher for those with
repeated episodes.4,5 Good-quality assessment of people when
they present to hospital with self-harm is a core part of
clinical practice in many countries and can reduce risk of repeat
self-harm.6–8 Following an initial assessment by emergency
department staff, liaison psychiatry clinicians may subsequently
provide a more comprehensive evaluation of needs and risk, often
including formal risk scales.6,9,10 The use of risk scales in the
assessment of self-harm is contentious,6,11,12 with some clinical
guidelines advocating the use of psychometrically tested scales
over locally developed proformas11 and others suggesting that risk
instruments should not be used to predict outcome but may be
used to help structure assessments.6 Despite limited evidence for
their effectiveness, risk scales are in widespread use in hospital
services. Our recent study of 32 hospitals in England found over
20 tools in use, indicating uncertainty over which are the best
scales following self-harm.12 This reflects the situation inter-
nationally.8 This uncertainty concerning risk-prediction scales
may be indicative of the inconsistency in the evidence base.6,13
Our recent systematic review of cohort studies evaluating the
predictive accuracy of scales included 8 studies14–21 and 11 scales.
Sensitivity for identifying repeat episodes ranged from 97% for
the Manchester Self-Harm Rule17 to 3% for the Modified SAD
PERSONS scale,22 and positive predictive values ranged from
70% for the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale23 to 7% for the Modified
SAD PERSONS Scale.13 Other reviews report similarly variable
performance across risk scales.8,24–26
On the basis of the published work it is not possible to identify
the
best
performing
scale.
Direct comparison
of
different
instruments between studies is not appropriate because of wide
variations in methodological quality, case mix, study setting,
scoring thresholds, follow-up and reporting. Analyses also tend
to be restricted to those based on available contingency tables
(for
example,
sensitivity,
specificity,
positive
and
negative
predictive values). Without access to raw data, it is not possible
to investigate more comprehensive measures of performance
such as the ‘area under the receiver operating characteristic curve’,
which
evaluates
the
performance
of
a
scale
at
different
thresholds.13,27 In order to compare different risk scales, we tested
the predictive utility of widely used instruments as well as clinician
and patient-rated global measures of risk in a multicentre cohort
study in England with a 6-month follow-up. Our overall aim was

Background
Scales are widely used in psychiatric assessments following
self-harm. Robust evidence for their diagnostic use is lacking.
Aims
To evaluate the performance of risk scales (Manchester
Self-Harm Rule, ReACT Self-Harm Rule, SAD PERSONS scale,
Modified SAD PERSONS scale, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale);
and patient and clinician estimates of risk in identifying
patients who repeat self-harm within 6 months.
Method
A multisite prospective cohort study was conducted of adults
aged 18 years and over referred to liaison psychiatry
services following self-harm. Scale a priori cut-offs were
evaluated using diagnostic accuracy statistics. The area
under the curve (AUC) was used to determine optimal
cut-offs and compare global accuracy.
Results
In total, 483 episodes of self-harm were included in the
study. The episode-based 6-month repetition rate was 30%
(n = 145). Sensitivity ranged from 1% (95% CI 0–5) for the SAD
PERSONS scale, to 97% (95% CI 93–99) for the Manchester
Self-Harm Rule. Positive predictive values ranged from
13% (95% CI 2–47) for the Modified SAD PERSONS Scale
to 47% (95% CI 41–53) for the clinician assessment of
risk. The AUC ranged from 0.55 (95% CI 0.50–0.61) for
the SAD PERSONS scale to 0.74 (95% CI 0.69–0.79) for the
clinician global scale. The remaining scales performed
significantly worse than clinician and patient estimates of risk
(P50.001).
Conclusions
Risk scales following self-harm have limited clinical utility and
may waste valuable resources. Most scales performed no
better than clinician or patient ratings of risk. Some
performed considerably worse. Positive predictive values
were modest. In line with national guidelines, risk scales
should not be used to determine patient management or
predict self-harm.

 to compare the performance of the scales in people who were
referred from the emergency department to psychiatric liaison
services following self-harm. This evidence is important for
clinicians, service providers, commissioners and policymakers in
order to critically evaluate the use of risk scales. To increase the
ecological validity of the study, the clinicians administered the risk
assessments as close to the usual psychiatric assessment as
possible. Our specific objectives were to: (a) estimate the
predictive accuracy of the scales for repeat self-harm using
published cut-offs; (b) plot receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves and examine the area under the curve (AUC) for
each of the scales; (c) estimate the predictive accuracy of the
scales for repeat self-harm using data-determined optimal cut-offs
that maximise sensitivity and specificity in this sample. We
hypothesised that specific scales, which are often based on the
most important epidemiological risk factors,6,13–21 would perform
better than global measures of clinician- or patient-rated risk.
Method
We conducted a multicentre prospective cohort study to examine
the diagnostic accuracy of risk scales for repeat self-harm. The
study was reviewed and approved by the Central Manchester
Research Ethics Committee (REC No: 13/NW/0838) prior to
commencement.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Participants were patients aged 18 years or over who were referred
from emergency departments to psychiatric liaison services for
assessment following self-harm in five large teaching hospitals in
England (Brighton, Bristol, Derby, Manchester and Oxford),
between March 2014 and January 2015. We did not include people
under the age of 18 years because, in the UK, service provision is
different for younger people.28,29 We focused on people who
received a psychiatric assessment because risk assessments are a
key component of psychiatric practice and are in widespread
use.6,12 People who are referred for psychiatric assessment may
also be at higher risk of adverse outcomes than patients who are
not referred.30,31 Previous research suggests that patients who
present with self-harm and receive a psychiatric assessment are
older, and less likely to be unemployed or use self-cutting as a
method of self-harm and more likely to have factors suggestive
of current mental illness or treatment than those who were not
assessed.32 People who were unable to understand English were
excluded as the risk scales have not been translated or tested in
non-English-speaking groups. People who were unable to consent
(for example, because of impaired consciousness or active
psychosis) or who were deemed too unwell or aggressive to
participate by the clinical team were also excluded. Episodes where
the patient did not stay for psychiatric assessment or treatment
were also not included.
Service provision
The five research sites were based in urban areas and varied in
population size (150 000–500 000), deprivation (from the 5th
most deprived area out of 326 local authorities to the 166th),
ethnicity (proportion of individuals from Black and minority
ethnic
groups
5.8–33.3%),
and
rates
of
unemployment
(proportion unemployed 3.6–8.1%). The services for people
who self-harm were provided by multidisciplinary psychiatric
liaison teams that included psychiatric nurses, social workers,
consultant psychiatrists and junior doctors. Junior doctors and/
or crisis teams provided out-of-hours services at all sites. The
teams varied in their hours of operation; three were available
24 h, 7 days a week, and two of the teams were available from
around 07.00 to 21.00. The proportion of patients who received
a psychiatric assessment ranged from 45 to 77%. Consistent
with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
guidelines, each patient episode of self-harm is treated in its
own right as a one-time visit.6 The duration of assessments is
dependent on patient need but they usually have a modal duration
of around 1 h.
Case definition
There are debates over nomenclature in suicide prevention
research and several terms are used to denote self-harm and
suicidal behaviour.33,34 Terms such as ‘non-suicidal self-injury’
(self-injury without intent) or suicide attempts (self-harm with
suicidal intent) are frequently used to classify patients;35 but
focusing on specific methods and/or suicidal intent may be
clinically problematic.28,36 Suicidal behaviour is often characterised
by ambivalence and changeability, intent may vary both between
and within episodes, and even apparently low-intent episodes
are associated with high mortality risk.28,36,37 Therefore, consistent
with national UK guidance6 we included all presentations for
self-harm in this study – defined as episodes of intentional self-
injury or self-poisoning, irrespective of motivation or degree of
suicidal intent.38 The same definition was used across all research
sites.
We calculated that a sample size of 480 would provide
adequate statistical power to estimate diagnostic properties with
reasonable precision (for example, assuming a repeat rate of
15%, the 95% confidence interval around a sensitivity of 0.80
would be 0.69–0.89) and also to detect a difference between the
accuracy of scales. We therefore had a target sample size of
approximately 100 per centre.39,40
Procedure
The research team met with clinicians at all sites on several
occasions to familiarise them with the study procedure and risk
scales and to answer any queries. In all cases clinicians (largely
nurses and psychiatrists) obtained informed consent from patients
as well as conducting the assessments. The assessments generally
took place in the emergency department or on a medical ward.
We adopted an episode-based approach to analysis, that is, we
investigated repetition subsequent to each episode of self-harm,
which meant that some individuals were included more than once.
This more readily reflects the clinical reality of presentation to
services19,41 and is consistent with national guidelines that suggest
each episode should be assessed in its own right.6
Scales
The assessment scales were selected for inclusion in the study
on the basis of a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy
of risk scales in previous studies13 as well as practical service
considerations (such as time taken to complete the scale – a scale
with a large number of items would be highly unlikely to be
adopted in routine practice). They included basic clinical and
demographic information. The Manchester Self-Harm Rule,
ReACT Self-Harm Rule, Modified SAD PERSONS scale, and
SAD PERSONS scale comprised items collected as part of the
clinical assessment. The Barratt Impulsiveness Scale included
specifically collected data. Because of this, it was not possible to
randomise the order of administration of the scales. On the advice
of the clinical teams and in order not to disrupt the routine
430
Quinlivan et al
 Predictive accuracy of risk scales following self-harm
clinical assessments the study was in general introduced after the
clinical interviews.
For the risk scales (Barratt Impulsiveness Scale,23 Manchester
Self-Harm Rule,17 ReACT Self-Harm Rule,19 SAD PERSONS
scale,42 Modified SAD PERSONS scale22) a priori cut-offs were
chosen on the basis of previous literature.13 It was, of course,
not possible to have full masking of the scales, but clinicians were
masked to how they were scored and the scoring thresholds. We
also included a clinician and patient global evaluation of risk
scale. These each consisted of a single question, which asked the
respondent to estimate the likelihood of repeat self-harm within
6 months on a 1–10 Likert-type scale (for example: ‘How likely
do you think it is, that [you]/[the patient] will repeat self-harm
within the next six months? Please indicate on this scale (with 1
as extremely unlikely and 10 extremely likely)’
. We used the
mid-point as our cut-off point (i.e. 0 to 5, low risk; 6+ high risk).
Further details are available from the authors on request. Further
details on all the scales, the assessment, and scoring are presented
in online supplement DS1.
Reference standard
The outcome for the study was hospital-treated repeat self-harm
within 6 months of presentation and was ascertained masked to
index test results from hospital databases by linking National
Health Service (NHS) and local hospital numbers where available.
Where these were not available, cases were linked by using a
combination of date of presentation, name and age. Teams in
the individual centres carried out all data linkage and identifiable
data were not passed to the research team. The date of each
subsequent episode of self-harm was ascertained and clinicians
used the standard definition of self-harm described above. The
time frame of 6 months was selected, as this is a high-risk period
and one that has often been used in previous studies.43,44
Analysis
Predictive accuracy statistics
The diagnostic accuracy of each of the scales in Table 1 was
evaluated using a range of diagnostic accuracy statistics and
95%
confidence
intervals,
including:
sensitivity,
specificity,
negative/positive predictive values, positive/negative likelihood
ratios
and the
diagnostic odds ratio
using
predetermined
published cut-off points where available (see online supplement
DS2
for
definitions).13
Meta-analysis
using
random-effects
modelling (DerSimonian–Laird method)45 was used to explore
variation by centre in sensitivity and specificity. Heterogeneity
was evaluated as present if Cochran’s Q was less than 0.10 and
Higgins I 2 was greater than 50%.46 The scales were analysed
separately. ROC curves, which plot sensitivity on the y-axis and
1 – specificity on the x-axis for all possible cut-off points, were
constructed for each total scale score and overall discriminative
ability was evaluated by the AUC.27 Higher values for the AUC
indicate greater discriminatory power. An AUC of 1.0 indicates
a perfect test and 0.5 indicates the result is no better than
chance.47 We compared the formal scales to the clinician- and
patient-rated global measures of risk by calculating the difference
between the respective AUCs.48 For our third aim, optimal cut-off
points for our sample were selected using Youden’s J index, which
maximises the difference between true and false positive rates
(provides the point with the furthest distance from the diagonal
line).27 Standard errors and exact binomial exact confidence
intervals were calculated using the DeLong method.48
Scales were generally very well completed, with the exception
of the 30-item Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, and we used
multiple regression imputation for episodes that had less than
5% missing data on this scale.49 SPSS version 20, Stata 13.0 and
OpenEpi (Open Source Epidemiologic Statistics for Public Health,
www.OpenEpi.com) were used for the analyses.
Patient involvement
An expert-by-experience was a co-applicant on the NIHR
Programme Grant and actively contributed to the study design.
Patient advisors, carers and clinicians contributed to the research
questions, scales (for example, we included patient and clinician
global estimations of risk) and outcomes. There was also patient
input into our dissemination plan, which includes dissemination
to participants and the relevant patient community.
Results
Demographic characteristics
Participating clinicians considered 1301 patients referred to liaison
psychiatry services after self-harm for inclusion in the study, of
whom 421 were judged not to be appropriate (for example, they
were too unwell, too distressed, intoxicated or in police custody)
and 353 refused to participate. The consenting sample resulted in
data on 514 separate episodes of self-harm that was reduced to
483 after exclusion of episodes with significant missing data on
key scales. The 483 episodes of self-harm represented data from
464 separate individuals, with 12 individuals appearing in the
data-set more than once. Psychiatric liaison nurses conducted
the majority of the assessments (n = 374/483, 77.4%). Psychiatrists
conducted 82/483 of the assessments (17%) and the remainder
were conducted by junior doctors/nurses or other allied health
professionals (such as social workers, therapists) that were
attached to the clinical teams (n = 26/483, 5.4%). The assessor
was unknown for one of the assessments (0.2%).
The median age for the sample was 33 years (interquartile
range 22–42 years, range 18–88 years), and over half were women
(298/483, proportion women 61.7%) and under 35 years of age
(297/481, 61.7%). The majority of the sample was of White
ethnicity (455/483, 94.2%). Many participants had a self-reported
history of previous self-harm (359/483, 74.3%), and 245/483
(50.7%) had had an episode of self-harm in the past 12 months.
Over half of the sample had a prior psychiatric history (310/
483, 64.2%). The most common method of self-harm was self-
poisoning (393/483, 81.4%), followed by self-cutting (71/483,
14.7%) and other methods (19/483, 3.9%) (for example drowning,
asphyxiation). In the 6 hours prior to the self-harm episode just over
half of the participants had used alcohol (248/470, 52.8%) and 11%
recreational drugs (51/463). The episode-based 6-month self-harm
repetition rate was 30% (145/483).
Scores on the risk scales and repeat self-harm
The distribution of the tested scale results using established cut-
offs and for the clinician and patient global estimations of risk
using the median cut-off points are presented in Table 1.
Performance of the scales
Diagnostic performance varied greatly. Sensitivity, which is the
proportion of patients who repeated self-harm and were correctly
identified by the scale as high risk, ranged from 1% for the SAD
PERSONS scale using the moderate/high-risk threshold to 97%
for the Manchester Self-Harm Rule and ReACT Rule at the
recommended cut-off of one. Positive predictive values, which
are the probability that a patient identified as high risk by the
431
 Quinlivan et al
test actually went on to repeat self-harm, were low for the high
sensitivity scales (Manchester Self-Harm Rule and the ReACT
Rule) (34 and 35%). Positive predictive values were highest for
the clinician global estimation of risk scale (47%), followed by
the patient global estimation of risk scale (44%), using the
mid-point cut-off for each. The full range of diagnostic accuracy
statistics for the scales when using a priori cut-off points are
presented in Table 2, and those for optimised cut-offs, which
maximise sensitivity and specificity according to Youden’s J index,
in Table 3.
Heterogeneity between sites
The performance of the Manchester Self-Harm Rule, ReACT Self-
Harm Rule, the patient global scale, the Barratt Impulsiveness
Scale and the Modified SAD PERSONS scale using a priori cut-offs
was similar across sites, with no statistical evidence of heterogeneity.
For the clinician global rating of risk, specificity varied from 58 to
82% (t2 = 0.16, w2 = 13.4, d.f.= 5, P= 0.01, I 2 = 70.4%). Specificity
also varied for the SAD PERSONS scale (between 74 and 96%),
(t2 = 0.46, w2 = 14.6, d.f.= 5, P50.01, I 2 = 73%).
Area under the receiver operating characteristic
curves
The ROC curves that show the relationship between the sensitivity
and specificity for the respective scales are presented in Fig. 1(a)
and 1(b) along with the AUC and 95% confidence intervals for
the respective scales. The AUCs of the seven scales varied between
bordering on no better than chance for the SAD PERSONS scale
(0.55) and Modified SAD PERSONS scale (0.58), to poor for the
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (0.62) and fair accuracy for the
ReACT Self-Harm Rule (0.70), patients’ estimation of risk
(0.72), Manchester Self-Harm Rule (0.72) and clinicians’ global
estimation of risk (0.74).
Regarding global estimations of risk, both the clinician and
patient scales were significantly better than the SAD PERSONS
scale (AUC difference: 0.19, P50.001; AUC difference: 0.16,
P50.001, respectively), the Modified SAD PERSONS scale
(AUC
difference:
0.16,
P50.001;
AUC
difference:
0.13,
P50.001) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (AUC difference:
0.12, P50.001; AUC difference: 0.09, P50.001). There were no
significant differences between the global estimates of risk and
the remainder of the scales.
Discussion
Main findings
The results of this multisite prospective cohort study indicate that
risk scales generally performed poorly in terms of predicting
repeat self-harm. High sensitivity scales tended to have poor
specificity and vice versa. Possible exceptions to this were
clinician- and patient-rated measures of global risk. Contrary to
our hypothesis, formal risk scales performed no better than the
global assessments and in some cases there was evidence (on the
basis of ROC curves) that performance was significantly worse.
Using our available study data to select optimal cut-offs in this
sample resulted in better performance (Table 3), but these were
essentially post hoc estimations of ‘best case’ predictive utility
and would not be generalisable to other samples. Our findings
suggest that risk assessment tools have limited clinical utility in
the assessment of self-harm.
Strengths and limitations
This is one of the few studies to compare widely used risk scales
following self-harm in a ‘head-to-head’ prospective cohort study.
The risk scales were administered by treating clinicians and
prospectively evaluated in a large real-world sample of patients
referred to liaison psychiatric services for self-harm. We used clear
consistent terminology across sites and had near-complete patient
follow-up, although it is possible that some patients could have
moved or died during the study period without the knowledge

a. Cut-off based on Randall et al.20
 Predictive accuracy of risk scales following self-harm
of the clinical services. We used a broad definition of suicidal
behaviour consistent with UK research and clinical practice. In
fact, a post hoc analysis involving the 357 self-poisoning episodes
(which would be consistently included in most definitions of
suicidal behaviour internationally) generated similar results.
There is a risk of sampling bias as patients who refused to
complete
the
research
assessments
or
who
were
deemed
inappropriate to participate were not included in the study, which
may affect the generalisability of the results. Recent large multi-
centre studies of self-harm in England suggest our sample was
similar to overall patient samples in terms of gender,19,41,50,51
method of self-harm,3,19,41,50 and age.41,50,51 Our recruitment rates
are comparable with trials that involve obtaining individual
consent from patients who have self-harmed.6,28 However, the
proportion of the sample with a prior history of self-harm
(74.3%) and the repetition rate in our sample within 6 months
(30%) was high,40 possibly suggesting comparatively high levels
of underlying morbidity and need.
The results of our study should be applicable to other
psychiatric services with a similar case mix and incidence of repeat
self-harm but may not be applicable to people who present to
emergency
departments
and
do
not
receive
a
psychiatric
assessment. Patients who do not receive a psychiatric assessment
following self-harm are likely to be younger, unemployed and
use self-cutting as a method of self-harm, and have an absence
of factors that indicate current mental illness.32 Our results may
also not be generalisable to people who engage in self-harm but
do not present to hospital.
The repetition rate in these groups is likely to be lower, so it may
be that the predictive performance of scales will be even worse. Our
findings will also not be generalisable to patients who do not wait
for assessment, who may be at higher risk than other patients
who have self-harmed. Although we had a large sample from
geographically dispersed sites this may not be representative of
other hospitals in England or internationally. The five centres
included in this study have an interest in self-harm management
and research, and clinicians working in these sites may not be
typical of those practising elsewhere. This could affect the
generalisability of the results to other services, perhaps particularly
those findings based on clinicians’ global risk assessments.

 Quinlivan et al
This observational study was designed to mimic how risk
scales would be completed in clinical practice. The effect of
ordering is likely to be minimal as the items from the scales
(Manchester Self-Harm Rule, ReACT Self-Harm Rule, SAD
PERSONS scale, Modified SAD PERSONS scale) were extracted
from the notes subsequent to the information already gathered
from the assessment. Although clinicians were masked to the
scoring of the scales and the scale results, their use could have
changed patient management. For example, patients deemed at
greater risk might have been offered more intensive interventions
that may have meant that they were then less likely to repeat
self-harm. This could lead to an underestimate of predictive
performance – that is, our findings on the risk scales might be
unnecessarily pessimistic. We do not think this will have had a
major impact on our findings. The availability of suitable
interventions following self-harm is poor 6,52 and even if patients
receive them, the evidence from randomised trials is that effect
sizes are relatively modest.6,53
We focused on episodes rather than individuals in order to
reflect the clinical reality of fluctuating risk19 and to be consistent
with national guidance that suggests each episode should be
treated in its own right.6 A small number of individuals
contributed more than one assessment, which could potentially
inflate the repetition rate and diagnostic accuracy statistics. There
was a small decrease in the repetition rate for individuals when
compared with the episode-based repetition rate (28.2% v.
30%), but this had little impact on our results. The order of
the scales in terms of AUC was unchanged. The AUC values
themselves
were
slightly
attenuated
(clinician
global
scale:
AUC = 0.73; Manchester Self-Harm Rule: AUC = 0.71; patient
global scale: AUC = 0.70; ReACT Self-Harm Rule AUC = 0.69,
Barratt Impulsiveness Scale AUC = 0.62; Modified SAD PERSONS
scale AUC = 0.59; and the SAD PERSONS scale: AUC = 0.56).
Our outcome was repeated self-harm rather than suicide.
Suicide is a critically important outcome for research and clinical
practice but a challenging area for diagnostic accuracy studies. The
low base rate makes prediction difficult and the diagnostic
accuracy of scales is generally poor.6 Future research could
examine the performance of risk scales in the prediction of
suicide, which may be possible with very large multicentre
prospective cohort studies. However, factors associated with
future suicide may not be the same as those that are associated
with risk of future self-harm.6
Comparison with previous research
The performance of the scales using a priori cut-off points is
consistent with previous research. The Manchester Self-Harm
Rule had similar sensitivity (97%) and specificity (20%) to
previous validation studies of the Manchester Self-Harm Rule,19
but lower specificity than in the original study.17 The ReACT
Self-Harm Rule had an equivalent sensitivity (97%) but higher
specificity (23%) in this sample than in the original study (97%
and 20%, respectively).19
Using the same cut-off as Randall et al,20 the Barratt
Impulsiveness Scale had a lower sensitivity (3% v. 20%) in this
sample but similar specificity (98% v. 97%, respectively). The
poor performance of the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale may be a
result of cultural differences as the scale was developed in the
USA and may not be directly relevant for a clinical population
in the UK; for example, the item ‘I squirm at plays and lectures’
caused queries and some respondents found it difficult to
answer.13 The length of the scale (30 items) may also have been
an issue. It should also be noted that this scale was not developed
as an instrument to predict repeat suicidal behaviour but as a
measure of impulsivity, which is just one risk factor for suicidal
behaviour.54 The poor performance of the SAD PERSONS scale
and Modified SAD PERSONS scale in predicting repeat self-harm
is consistent with previous cohort studies.15,55
Clinical implications
The use of risk scales is dependent on clinical context.13 For
example, clinicians may prefer scales with high sensitivity for
screening or ruling out a risk of a condition, or scales high in
specificity for later stages of assessment or ruling in patients for
treatment.13 However, our findings suggest that risk scales on their
own have little role in the management of suicidal behaviour. For
example, one of the best performing scales, the Manchester Self-
Harm Rule, captured 97 out of every 100 repeat episodes, but
incorrectly classified 80/100 of episodes that did not lead to
repetition as high risk. Of 100 episodes rated as high risk only
30 resulted in repetition. The scales performed no better (and in
some cases significantly worse) than simply asking clinicians or
patients what they thought of the future risk. The usefulness of
the scales might improve if the cut-off points were tailored to local
clinical settings, but the results would then not be generalisable
and the cut-offs may not be stable over time.
It was perhaps surprising that the crude global estimates of
risk performed comparatively well. On the other hand, clinicians
in this study were generally experienced and may have used all
the available clinical information and direct observation to come
to a more balanced judgement of risk than a score on a simple
scale. Of course, it could also be that the clinicians used the scales
themselves to inform their overall judgement, but they were not
provided with the scoring schedule for the scales and much of
the data consisted of items that would be collected as part of
routine assessment. These explanations would of course not apply
to the patient assessment of risk.
Is there scope for using global estimation of risk scales as a
useful part of routine assessments? We think this is unlikely since
the positive predictive values for the clinician global scale

 Predictive accuracy of risk scales following self-harm
indicated that for every 100 patients rated as high risk, fewer than
half would go on to repeat. Of 100 patients who did not repeat, 36
would be incorrectly classified as at high risk.
Of course, risk scales might be useful in ways other than
prediction. For example, to help structure assessments, to ensure
crucial items are not missed or as measures of change. Can risk
scales do any harm? Some observational evidence suggests that
routine aspects of clinical care such as psychosocial assessment
and psychiatric admission could contribute to a reduction in
risk.28,30,56 Risk scales may have a negative impact on the
beneficial aspects of routine psychosocial assessments.11,57 They
may be perceived as a negative tokenistic ‘tick box’ exercise by
both
clinicians
and
patients
and
erode
the
potential
to
collaboratively evaluate risk of future self-harm and determine
appropriate management.58 At a time of increased service pressures
it might even be argued that the use of risk scales to determine
patient management actually wastes valuable resources.8
Future research
Consistent with clinical guidelines, our data suggest that risk scales
should not be used to determine patient management or risk of
future self-harm. 6 One relatively unexplored area is the use of risk
assessment as an intervention. In forensic settings, randomised
trials of formal risk assessment have had conflicting results.59,60
Randomised controlled trials could test the impact of using risk
scales v. assessment as usual on patient management and repeat
self-harm, including adverse events and cost-effectiveness. We
are currently undertaking health economic modelling work that
will provide an indication of how good risk tools might need to
be in terms of predictive ability in order to be cost-effective.
Given the poor performance of scales, it is possible that the
scales may be missing important aspects relevant to repeat suicidal
behaviour (for example social, cultural, economic or psychological
processes).56,61,62 Future research should include patients in the
development of appropriate measures and assessments and could
also consider suicide as an outcome. It is likely that the predictive
ability of assessment varies according to clinician factors (such as
level of experience, professional background), patient factors
(history of suicidal behaviour or psychiatric treatment), and
assessment factors (received a psychiatric assessment or did not
wait for assessment), and these could also be investigated. Studies
might examine the role of global clinician and patient assessments
of risk, with a focus on their predictive performance but also
an examination of the factors that contribute to these complex
judgements.
