Abstract
Mutations conferring resistance to antibiotics are typically costly in the absence of the drug,
but bacteria can reduce this cost by acquiring compensatory mutations. Thus, the rate of
acquisition of compensatory mutations and their effects are key for the maintenance and
dissemination of antibiotic resistances. While compensation for single resistances has been
extensively studied, compensatory evolution of multiresistant bacteria remains unexplored.
Importantly, since resistance mutations often interact epistatically, compensation of multire-
sistant bacteria may significantly differ from that of single-resistant strains. We used experi-
mental evolution, next-generation sequencing, in silico simulations, and genome editing to
compare the compensatory process of a streptomycin and rifampicin double-resistant
Escherichia coli with those of single-resistant clones. We demonstrate that low-fitness dou-
ble-resistant bacteria compensate faster than single-resistant strains due to the acquisition
of compensatory mutations with larger effects. Strikingly, we identified mutations that only
compensate for double resistance, being neutral or deleterious in sensitive or single-resis-
tant backgrounds. Moreover, we show that their beneficial effects strongly decrease or dis-
appear in conditions where the epistatic interaction between resistance alleles is absent,
demonstrating that these mutations compensate for the epistasis. In summary, our data
indicate that epistatic interactions between antibiotic resistances, leading to large fitness
costs, possibly open alternative paths for rapid compensatory evolution, thereby potentially
stabilizing costly multiple resistances in bacterial populations.
Author summary
Antibiotics target essential cellular functions, such as translation or cell wall biogenesis,
and bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics by acquiring mutations in genes encoding
those functions. This causes most drug-resistance mutations to be detrimental in the
absence of the drug. However, bacteria can reduce this handicap by acquiring additional
mutations, known as compensatory mutations. Compensatory evolution is crucial for the
maintenance and dissemination of antibiotic resistances in bacterial populations. While
compensation for single resistances has been extensively studied, compensatory evolution

 of multidrug-resistant bacteria remains unexplored. Importantly, interactions between
resistance mutations are frequent, and this may cause compensation of multidrug-resis-
tant bacteria to differ significantly from that of single-resistant strains. By comparing
compensation of single- and double-drug–resistant E. coli, we found that double-drug–
resistant bacteria compensate faster than single-drug–resistant strains. This is due to the
acquisition of compensatory mutations with larger effects and possibly driven by the large
fitness cost of double-drug resistance. Strikingly, we identified mutations that compensate
specifically for the interaction between drug resistances, since they are beneficial only for
double-drug–resistant bacteria and in conditions in which the interaction between resis-
tances occurs. In summary, our data indicate that certain interactions between antibiotic-
resistance mutations can open alternative paths for rapid compensatory evolution, thereby
potentially stabilizing multiple drug resistances in bacterial populations.
Introduction
Bacteria evolve to endure antibiotics through the acquisition of genes or chromosomal muta-
tions that confer resistance to the drugs [1–3]. Resistance mutations are widespread in clinical
[2,4,5] and environmental [6,7] bacterial populations, providing a reservoir that can be trans-
mitted by horizontal gene transfer [3,8]. Moreover, as microbes become resistant to a specific
drug, the subsequent use of alternative antibiotics might select for additional resistances, thus
leading to the increasing menace of multidrug-resistant strains [2,9–11]. This is a prevalent
scenario in Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for instance, in which
multiple resistances pose a serious threat to human health [9,12–14]. Thus, disclosing the evo-
lutionary factors governing the maintenance of multiple resistance is key for designing effec-
tive treatments.
Chromosomal mutations conferring resistance, the focus of this study, are typically deleteri-
ous in the absence of antibiotics [15,16], since often they affect proteins involved in essential
cellular machinery, such as the ribosome (i.e., streptomycin) [17] or the RNA polymerase—
RNAP—(i.e., rifampicin) [18–20]. Nevertheless, bacteria can curb this deleterious effect by
acquiring compensatory mutations [15,21–23]. This allows antibiotic resistance to become sta-
bilized in the population while paying little or even no cost [24]. Acquiring additional muta-
tions to overcome the fitness cost of resistance is also more likely to occur than the genetic
reversion of the resistance mutation, since the range of targets for compensation is much
broader [24,25]. Compensation for the cost of resistance has been widely described both in
clinical [11,19] and laboratory [17,18,20] settings. The dynamics of compensatory adaptation
depends on population parameters, such as bottlenecks [17] and mutation rate [21], and on
the distribution of fitness effects of compensatory mutations, which depends on the genetic
background [22].
Studies of compensation have focused on single resistances (e.g., [17,20,23,26]). However,
resistance mutations often interact such that the fitness cost of multiple resistance tends to dif-
fer from that expected given the effects of each resistance [24,27]. These epistatic interactions
might originate from the fact that resistance mutations affect interconnected functions in the
cell [2]. Thus, cooccurring resistance mutations can lead to synergistic or antagonistic func-
tional interactions [24–26]. This leads us to hypothesize that compensatory evolution of multi-
ple-resistant bacteria may substantially differ from that of single-resistant strains. This may be
especially important for chromosomal resistance mutations that exhibit negative epistasis,
since the proteins involved in the interactions between the resistance mutations (which

 potentially contribute to the epistasis) could become targets for compensation. In that sce-
nario, additional mutations beyond those that compensate for each individual resistance may
be expected to occur. Thus, we further postulate that mutations that specifically compensate
for epistasis should emerge during the evolution of multiple-resistant bacteria. To test these
hypotheses, we followed the compensatory adaptation of single- and double-E. coli–resistant
strains in antibiotic-free media. We chose three founder genotypes carrying chromosomal
resistance mutations as a case study: RpoBH526Y (conferring resistance to rifampicin),
RpsLK43T (conferring resistance to streptomycin), and a strain harboring the two mutations
(RpoBH526Y RpsLK43T), which show negative epistasis, causing a strong decrease in bacterial
fitness [24,28].
To dissect the process of compensation for the mentioned founder genotypes, we analyzed
the dynamics of the frequencies of neutral markers during compensatory evolution, performed
whole-genome sequencing of evolved clones and allelic reconstruction of putative compensa-
tory mutations in all genetic backgrounds. Our results demonstrate faster compensation in
low-fitness double-resistant bacteria and unveil the identity of mutations that compensate for
the negative epistasis between resistances. These mutations are advantageous only for double-
resistant genotypes, i.e., they are either neutral or deleterious for single resistant and sensitive
clones, as well as in environments where the epistasis between resistances is absent.
Results
Double-resistant bacteria compensate faster than single-resistant
strains
To study the dynamics of compensation and determine its pace, we performed experimental
evolution in an antibiotic-free medium of six E. coli clones representing three founder geno-
types, each carrying either of two neutral markers (Cyan fluorescent protein [CFP] or yellow
fluorescent protein [YFP], S1 Fig): two carrying a RifR (RpoBH526Y) allele, two carrying a StrR
(RpsLK43T) allele, and two carrying both resistant alleles RifR StrR (RpoBH526Y RpsLK43T). The
single resistances cause different fitness costs (0.06 ± 0.001 for RpoBH526Y and 0.03 ± 0.01 for
RpsLK43T) and generate strong negative epistasis—0.27 ± 0.01 >> (0.06 ± 0.01) + (0.03 ± 0.01)
—in the double mutant (see S2 Fig). The neutral markers allow us to readily identify the emer-
gence of compensatory mutations, as the frequency of a neutral marker is expected to rapidly
increase when adaptive mutations sweep through evolving populations. Conversely, a marker
should decrease in frequency when a beneficial mutation occurs in the subpopulation carrying
the other marker. The number of generations, together with the relatively large population size
and the mild bottlenecks during the propagations (see materials and methods), ensure that
adaptation will mostly be driven by positive selection [29]. However, it is possible that some
alleles that increase in frequency are neutral (or even slightly deleterious) and arise through
genetic hitchhiking with beneficial mutations [30,31]. We followed the changes in marker fre-
quencies over 22 days (~180 generations) in 12 independently evolving RifR populations, 12
StrR populations, and 24 RifR StrR populations (Fig 1A–1C).
We observed that, for the double-resistant RifR StrR population (Fig 1C), markers deviate
from their initial frequency faster and with steeper slopes than for either of the single-resistant
bacteria, RifR (Fig 1A, One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference [HSD]
correction, p < 0.0001) or StrR (Fig 1B, One-way ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD correction,
p = 0.001). In only 4 days of evolution, all double-resistant populations show signature of evo-
lutionary adaptation, indicated by the changes in the frequency of the markers, that either
reach frequencies close to fixation (>0.95) or show strong fluctuations. The latter indicate
competition between clones carrying adaptive mutations (clonal interference) in both CFP

 and YFP backgrounds. Rapid and strong changes in marker frequency dynamics are expected
for genetic backgrounds with low fitness—as it is the case for the double-resistant clones—
which have been reported to adapt faster [32–35]. In single-resistant clones, near fixation of a
marker is observed in a minority of the populations (three out of 12 RifR and 1 out of 12 StrR
populations) and only much later (8–10 days). Interestingly, the dynamics of RifR populations
show no strong signs of clonal interference, whereas this phenomenon can be observed in a
few StrR populations. This suggests that more targets for adaptation may be available for StrR
than for RifR, albeit with smaller effects.
Faster compensation of double-resistant bacteria is driven by strong-
effect mutations
To understand which process, mutation or selection, is responsible for the large differences in
the dynamics of compensation of double versus single resistances, we measured the competi-
tive fitness of the evolving populations along the adaptive process (defined by the increase in

 competitive ability of the evolving populations against a nonfluorescent sensitive strain, see
materials and methods). A clear increase in competitive fitness is observed in all resistant back-
grounds along the propagations (t-test p = 1x10−6 for RifR, p = 6x10−6 for StrR, and
p < 2x10−16 for RifR StrR, at day 22 of evolution, Fig 1D–1F), but the dynamics of fitness
change differ among the different evolved resistant populations. The first 5 days show a strong
and fast competitive fitness increase in RifR StrR bacteria compared to the other backgrounds
(Fig 1D–1F, ANCOVA, F(2,70) = 45.08, p < 0.0001, with 0.048 ± 0.003 fitness increase per
day, between day 0 and day 5, significantly higher than RifR [0.01 ± 0.004] or StrR
[0.01 ± 0.004]) backgrounds. After day 5, the RifR populations have a more pronounced fitness
increase along time compared to the other two backgrounds, in which competitive fitness
seems to approach stabilization (generalized linear mixed effects model [GLMEM], Chi2{2} =
362.9, p < 0.0001, with 0.006 ± 0.0006 competitive fitness increase per day between day 5 and
day 22, versus StrR [0.0015 ± 0.0006] and RifR StrR [0.0017 ± 0.0004]). Overall, the high initial
cost of the double resistance (compare black dots with red dashed line in Fig 1F) is, on average,
largely mitigated at day 5 (0.24 mean increase in competitive fitness, calculated as the differ-
ence between the competitive fitness of the evolved populations at day 5 and that of the
founder double mutant, standard deviation [SD] = 0.06, across the 24 populations). Interest-
ingly, the fitness increase of double-resistant bacteria appears to slow down at different fitness
levels in the different populations. For instance, in population six, no significant fitness
increase above 0.32 is observed after day 5 (linear regression’s differential fitness [dW] = y =
−0.0005x + 0.32; R2 = 0.024), whereas for population 12, no significant gain above 0.15 is
detected from day 9 onwards (dW = −0.001x + 0.149; R2 = 0.08, see Fig 1F and also S3 Fig).
This suggests that the first step of adaptation may involve mutations with different fitness
effects, which might condition the following adaptive steps.
The faster fitness increase in double-resistant bacteria can result from a higher rate of acqui-
sition of beneficial mutations (due to, for instance, a larger target size) and/or from acquisition
of mutations with stronger beneficial effects. To infer the rate and the distribution of effects of
arising beneficial mutations in each of the backgrounds, we used a modified version of the
One Bi-Allelic Marker Algorithm (OBAMAv2) [36] that considers both the marker dynamics
and the fitness trajectories along the adaptive walk (see materials and methods). OBAMAv2
infers that the rate of acquisition of beneficial mutations (U) is not significantly different
between the double resistant and the RifR populations (U ~ 3x10−6 per cell and generation),
being higher in the StrR background (U ~ 10−5 per cell and generation) (Fig 2A). This suggests
a larger target size for compensation of StrR. However, the mean selective effect of beneficial
mutations is higher for the RifR StrR background than for either of the single-resistance back-
grounds (0.18 for the double versus 0.1 for the RifR and 0.05 for the StrR)(Fig 2B). This could
be due to the acquisition of similar mutations causing different effects across backgrounds
with different initial fitnesses, as has been previously observed [33,34,37]. It may also be that
the mutations underlying compensation could be different in single- and double-resistant bac-
teria. In the latter case, double-resistant bacteria would have access to mutations with higher
mean selective benefit, which could potentially include compensatory alleles for the high cost
resulting from the epistasis between RifR and StrR.
Genetic basis of compensation in single- and double-resistant
backgrounds
To identify the compensatory mutations emerging in each of the studied founder genotypes,
we performed whole-genome sequencing of pools of evolved clones. We pooled one clone
from each evolved population carrying the fluorescence marker with the highest frequency at

 the end of the experiment (Fig 1A–1C). This allows capturing a broad sample of the compen-
satory landscape (Fig 3). We found mutations affecting compensatory targets previously
described (10 out of 16 allelic changes in RifR, 2 out of 15 in StrR, and 16 out of 57 in RifR StrR),
such as rpoB itself, rpoA, and rpoC for rifampicin resistance and rpsE, rpsD, and tufA for strep-
tomycin resistance (Fig 3). Indeed, several mutations found, affecting ribosomal genes, have
been previously described as compensatory for the streptomycin resistance allele RpsLK43N in
Salmonella Typhimurium [17] (RpsEA110V in the StrR background and RpsDD50Y in the RifR
StrR background) or affect similar residues (RpsDT86A, RpsET103P, and RpsEG109R in the RifR
StrR background). In addition, mutations in rpoA and in rpoC found in the RifR background
(RpoAT196I and RpoCH450P, respectively) were also previously identified as compensatory for
the allele RpoBH526Y [22]. We identified some putative compensatory targets that are common
to single- and double-resistant backgrounds. At the level of functional category, we observed
overlap in genes encoding membrane proteins (i.e., ybjO and nanC in RifR; cdgI and yojI in
StrR; ompF and ydiY in RifR StrR) and ribosomal proteins (rplL in RifR StrR and rplI in StrR). At
the gene level, there is a high parallelism, mostly involving the known compensatory targets

 previously mentioned, such as rpoA, rpoB, rpoC, rpsE, and tufA. At the nucleotide level, we
found three mutations common to the StrR and the double mutant: an insertion sequence [IS]
element in a known hotspot for IS elements upstream from the flhDCoperon [39], a nonsy-
nonymous change in tufA, and a 6 bp deletion in rplL. A single compensatory mutation was
found in common between RifR and the RifR StrR backgrounds: a reversion in rpoB (Fig 3 and
S1 Table). Reversions are typically rare [21,40], but clinically relevant, since bacteria regain
sensitivity to the antibiotic. To determine the extent to which reversion to sensitivity occurred
in our evolving populations, we phenotyped clones (n > 40) from each evolved population at
day 22. We streaked each clone sequentially on both the medium supplemented with antibi-
otic(s), at a concentration similar to where the founder genotypes were originally selected (i.e.,
100 ug/ml of rifampicin, streptomycin, or both drugs), and in the antibiotic-free medium. We
define “sensitivity” as the inability of a clone to grow in the presence of the antibiotic but able
to grow in the drug-free medium. Remarkably, we found that, in 6 out of 24 populations of the
RifR StrR background, sensitivity to either rifampicin or streptomycin emerged. We also found
the emergence of sensitive clones in the single-resistance evolved populations: in the RifR back-
ground, in two populations, fixation of sensitive clones was detected; in the StrR background,
the frequency of streptomycin-sensitive clones reached 64% (58%–71%, 95% confidence inter-
val [CI]) in one population and 69% (62%–75%) in another (see S2 Table). Curiously, while
the restoration of rifampicin sensitivity is mediated by a genetic reversion (RpoBY526H), the
tested clones that regained sensitivity to streptomycin still harbor the original mutation
(RpsLK43T) and thus experienced a phenotypic reversion. Notably, phenotypic reversion of
streptomycin resistance due to mutations in tufA (which appeared as target in our study) has
been previously reported [41,42].
Genetic reversions are expected to cause strong beneficial effects in the double-resistant
background, given that they provide a direct solution for the negative epistasis. For instance, a
reversion in rpoB in the double-resistant bacteria would cause a 24% fitness increase, from a
competitive fitness of 0.73 (27% cost) to 0.97 (3% cost) (see S2 Fig). Its rarity in the RifR StrR
background is a further indication of the emergence of other compensatory mutations with
strong fitness effects, which is consistent with the very large fitness gains observed in the dou-
ble-resistant populations (Fig 1C and Fig 1F). Interestingly, mutations affecting genes
involved in DNA replication and DNA repair (i.e., dnaG and mutL) were detected in double-
resistant evolved populations (Fig 3). Such mutations may have caused mutation rate changes
in some of the evolved clones, thus resulting in a higher number of mutations accumulated.
However, since the frequency of these mutations in the pooled run was only 3.6%, these muta-
tions appeared in only a few populations (two at most, in the case of mutL) and thus are
unlikely to have affected the estimation of evolutionary parameters (Fig 2). Apart from the pre-
viously mentioned IS element detected in some populations, both in the StrR and RifR StrR
populations (Fig 3), no other types of structural variation, such as duplications, could be
found, as assayed by looking for increases in coverage for any given region of the sequenced
evolved lines.
In summary, the limited overlap among nucleotide changes across backgrounds suggests
that single- and double-resistant bacteria acquire distinct compensatory mutations. This might
the 12 independently evolved StrR populations. The grey track and the black labels indicate mutations found in the 24 independently evolved RifR StrR.

 be due, at least partially, to the existence of mutations that compensate for the epistasis
between resistances in double-resistant bacteria.
Compensation for the epistasis between resistances
To test the hypothesis that epistatic interactions between the resistance alleles provide addi-
tional compensatory targets, we generated derivatives of all resistant backgrounds harboring
selected compensatory mutations that we have only found in double-resistance populations
and could potentially compensate for the epistasis. We used genetic reconstruction to isolate
the compensatory effect of each individual mutation for double-resistant bacteria, as well as
measuring its fitness effect in the sensitive and single-resistant backgrounds. To do so, we per-
formed competitions between derivatives of the founder genotypes (RpoBH526Y, RpsLK43T, or
RpoBH526Y RpsLK43T) harboring the compensatory mutation(s) and their corresponding
ancestral (not carrying the compensatory mutation) and estimated their fitness effect from dif-
ferences in growth over a 24 h competition (see materials and methods). We selected a single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the rpoC gene (RpoCQ1126K) because, although rpoC is a
common compensatory target for rifampicin resistance [19,26,43], this change was detected at
a very high frequency (26.1%) in the double RifR StrR populations but not detected in any of
the single-resistant populations (Fig 3 and S1 Table). Additionally, we chose two regulatory
mutations observed exclusively in the double-mutant background: one in the promoter region
of the secE-nusG bicistronic transcript [44] (nusG hereafter), and another in a regulatory sec-
ondary structure in the 50 untranslated region (50-UTR) of the operon that encodes rpsJ (nusE)
[45] (nusE hereafter). The latter two mutations were selected because they are good candidates
for being compensatory to epistasis, since NusG and NusE mediate the molecular interaction
between the ribosome and the RNAP [46] (Fig 4E).
We found the nusE mutation to be beneficial across all resistance backgrounds but neutral
in the sensitive bacteria (Fig 4A and S4A Fig). In contrast, the mutation in rpoC confers a
strong beneficial effect only in the double RifR StrR background, where it emerged, being neu-
tral or even slightly deleterious in either the single-resistance or the sensitive backgrounds (Fig
4B and S4B Fig). Finally, the nusG mutation is exclusively beneficial in the double RifR StrR
background, being highly deleterious in all other backgrounds (Fig 4C and S4C Fig). There-
fore, the beneficial effects of RpoCQ1126K and nusG compensatory mutations are strongly con-
ditioned by the presence of the two resistance alleles, suggesting that, in both cases, the target
of compensation is the epistatic interaction between the resistance alleles. To further corrobo-
rate this we measured the effects of RpoCQ1126K and nusG mutations in minimal medium sup-
plemented with glucose, an environment where RpoBH526Y and RpsLK43T were previously
shown not to exhibit negative epistasis [28]. We found that RpoCQ1126K loses most of its bene-
ficial effect in this environment (from 25.4% to 4%), indicating that it partially compensates
for the epistasis. Remarkably, nusG is indeed deleterious in minimal medium supplemented
with glucose, demonstrating that this mutation compensates specifically for the epistasis
between antibiotic resistances (Fig 4D, and S4B and S4C Fig). On the other hand, nusE does
not seem to compensate specifically for the negative epistasis (Fig 4A), as it is equally beneficial
in minimal medium supplemented with glucose, where the epistasis is not present. In sum, we
found that while nusE is a global compensatory mutation to the costs of resistance, RpoCQ1126K
and nusG are highly idiosyncratic and only likely to be found linked to double-resistant back-
grounds, since they compensate for the negative epistasis between these resistance alleles.
The striking difference in the fitness effects of nusE and nusG regulatory mutations
prompted us to analyze their effects on gene expression in the sensitive background by quanti-
tative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). The change in the leader transcript of nusE (Fig 5A) caused

with the mutation affecting a region involved in its transcriptional and translational attenua-
tion [47]. The mutation in nusG affects the −10 sequence of its promoter region (Fig 5B) [44],
resulting in a strong increase (above 4-fold) in its expression (Fig 5C, rightmost column).
Interestingly we found that the nusG mutation also causes upregulation of nusE expression
(Fig 5C, third column). This cross-regulation might be due to the fact that NusA participates
in the attenuation of nusE operon [47] and that NusG can interact with NusA [48], interfering
with its activity [49]. Importantly, the effects of the nusE and nusG regulatory mutations on
gene expression reflect their effects on the fitness of sensitive bacteria: the strong and pleiotro-
pic induction caused by the nusG mutation generates a high fitness cost (Fig 4C), while the
milder and less pleiotropic change on expression caused by the nusE mutation entails a close
to neutral fitness effect (Fig 4A). This suggests that the expression of these genes constitutes an
important mechanism connecting genotype, phenotype, and fitness.

 Discussion
As spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria increases, it is crucial to understand how multiple
resistant alleles can be maintained in populations [52]. Thus, investigating the process of
acquisition of compensatory mutations is essential. Although compensation for single-resis-
tance mutations has been thoroughly studied, our findings suggest that previous observations
are not readily transferrable to compensation in multiresistant strains. We demonstrate that
the pace of compensation is faster in a bacterium resistant to both rifampicin and streptomy-
cin, due to stronger effect mutations being accessible to this low-fit background. Compensa-
tion by stronger effect mutations is supported by direct competitive fitness assays, in which
high-fitness increments were detected (Fig 1). In particular, we found a mutation (RpoCH450P)
beneficial in the RifR background (s = 0.05 ± 0.01) that shows a stronger beneficial effect
(s = 0.10 ± 0.01) in the double mutant (S5 Fig). This is consistent with the general pattern
recurrently observed that low-fitness genotypes tend to acquire stronger effect mutations
[33,34,53,54] and tend to adapt at a faster pace [32,35]. Interestingly, when studying the evol-
vability of other RifR mutants, Barrick et al. found that lower-fitness genotypes were able to

 adapt faster due to access to stronger effect mutations [37]. Thus, our observations fit the pre-
vious found patterns.
Curiously, we observed that, in some adapted populations, the competitive fitness exceeds
the initial fitness cost of the ancestral genotype (see Fig 1D). This indicates that either there is
further adaptation to the environment (i.e., the ancestral genotype is not at or very near to the
fitness peak) beyond compensation and/or that the initial resistance mutation displaced the
genotype in the fitness landscape, allowing the exploration of other, potentially higher, fitness
peaks [55]. In order to determine the extent to which adaptation to the environment occurs in
our experimental conditions, we propagated sensitive bacteria during 22 days in an antibiotic-
free medium, performed competitive fitness assays, and determined the mutation targets asso-
ciated with such propagation (S6 Fig). We found that marker frequency changes at a much
slower pace (S6A Fig), but it is not static, and associated increases in competitive fitness can be
detected (S6B Fig). Therefore, other mutations associated with the adaptation to the environ-
ment occur. Thus, adaptation to the environment could also have occurred in the resistant
backgrounds. We note, however, that we could not detect any common mutational targets
between sensitive and resistant backgrounds (S6C Fig).
Interestingly, in the double-resistant backgrounds, the dynamics of fitness appear to stabi-
lize at different plateaus for different populations (Fig 1F and S3 Fig). However, the period of
propagation done in this study is too short to assess if these populations are indeed stabilizing
at different peaks. Nevertheless, it is possible to conceive the existence of a complex network of
epistatic interactions among the compensatory mutations. In that scenario, the initial acquisi-
tion of a given compensatory mutation could influence the fitness effects of subsequently
acquired compensatory mutations, restricting the range of evolutionary trajectories during
further adaptation [56].
When analyzing the genetic basis of compensation, we detected several new putative com-
pensatory targets (Fig 3). In principle, the general lack of overlap across the three mutant back-
grounds and the sensitive strain (Fig 3, S6C Fig, S1 Table) suggests that the majority of the
mutations found are not due to general adaptation to the selected growth conditions but,
instead, are driven by compensation to the cost of resistance. Moreover, although the target
size for adaptation to growth conditions might be large enough to make overlap relatively
infrequent, and the sampling method used (one clone per population) may limit detecting
overlapping mutations, many of the targets identified are directly related to transcription and
translation, suggesting that they are indeed compensatory.
The observation of parallelism in targets such as the mglBAC operon in the RifR StrR popu-
lations or the cytR gene in StrR populations suggests that targets of compensation not directly
related to rpsL and rpoB might be available. By genetic reconstruction, we found that a mglA
mutation is beneficial in both the RifR and RifR StrR backgrounds, being deleterious in the StrR
background and neutral in the sensitive (S7 Fig). This points to the mglA mutation being
indeed compensatory for RifR and not generally adaptive, which is also supported by its
absence in the mutational targets detected from the propagation of the sensitive strain (S6C
Fig). The functional unrelatedness of the mglBAC operon (sugar transport [57]) with the cellu-
lar machinery affected by the original RifR mutation (RNAP) suggests that the mutations in
the mglBAC operon do not correct for the damage generated by the resistance mutation.
Instead, they may somehow alleviate its consequence and, therefore, its fitness cost.
Several alleles reconstructed (RpoCQ1126K, nusG, and nusE) in the different backgrounds
were found to be beneficial in the single- or double-resistant genotypes but not in sensitive
bacteria, providing direct evidence of their compensatory role. The presence of these compen-
satory mutations has no discernible impact on the ability of sensitive, single-, or double-

 resistant bacteria to withstand rifampicin and streptomycin, as no significant change in their
minimum inhibitory concentrations was detected (S3 Table).
The dynamics of marker frequency and the distribution of fitness effects in the propagation
experiment (Fig 1C and 1F) suggest that double-resistant bacteria already acquired compensa-
tory mutations with large fitness effect by day 5. Indeed, population-sequencing of the evolved
double-mutant bacteria at day 5 (S1 Table) confirmed that several mutations present at day 22
appear already at day 5 (for instance, RpsET103P, RpoAH66Q, an IS insertion between insA and
uspC, RpoBE745K, RpoCA784V, RpoCQ1126K, RpoCE1030A, and RpoCI1248T). The maintenance of
these alleles in the populations suggests that their fitness effects are strong enough to have pre-
vented them from being outcompeted by other mutants during the evolution experiment.
Consistently, one of these mutations (RpoCQ1126K) was shown to cause a large compensatory
effect (Fig 4B).
Among the compensatory mutations found, we identified specific sets of mutations with
sign epistasis, i.e., that shift from beneficial to deleterious depending on the genetic back-
ground in which they occur (Fig 4). Indeed, we show that compensation in RifR StrR bacteria
can specifically target the epistatic interaction between the resistant alleles. Importantly, mech-
anisms specifically targeted by these compensatory mutations include the coupling between
transcription and translation, modulating the interaction between the resistances themselves.
For instance, NusG and NusE proteins, which constitute the molecular link between RNAP
and ribosomes [46] (Fig 4E), are mutational targets of compensation in the double-resistant
strains. NusE is part of the 30S ribosomal complex [58] and, besides connecting with the
RNAP through NusG [46], it has been suggested to bind to it directly [59]. Therefore, a benefi-
cial effect in the different resistance backgrounds, but not in sensitive bacteria, could be
expected. Moreover, the regulatory mutation in nusE likely affects the expression of its entire
operon, which encodes ten other ribosomal proteins, whose potential compensatory effects
will have to be analyzed in future research. On the other hand, the mutation affecting NusG, a
universally conserved transcription termination/antitermination factor, shows a beneficial
effect specific to the epistasis between streptomycin and rifampicin resistance alleles. A tenta-
tive explanation for this effect relies on the coupling of transcription and translation in pro-
karyotes. RpoBH526Y and RpsLK43T resistance mutations generate dysfunctional RNAP [60]
and ribosome [61], respectively, affecting transcription and translation efficiencies. These
altered processivities likely generate discoordination of these two machineries, therefore chal-
lenging the transcription–translation coupling. In that scenario, mutations causing increased
expression of factors involved in the physical interaction between the RNAP and the ribosome
(NusG and NusE) [46] may help to enhance their coordination, restoring the coupling. Indeed,
the RpoCQ1126K mutation partially compensates for the epistasis between resistances, and the
analysis of the E. coli RNAP structure available (PDB 3LUO) indicates that the residue Q1126
is at the surface of the RpoC protein and maps closely to the region of the protein described to
interact with NusG (Fig 4E and S8 Fig). This suggests that the RpoCQ1126K mutation could
also be mechanistically linked to the interaction between the RNAP and the ribosome and,
therefore, to transcription–translation coupling.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the NusG–NusE complex has been
identified as a compensatory target for antibiotic resistance. This shows the power of experi-
mental evolution to identify novel compensatory targets in resistant bacteria and also reveals
its potential at uncovering important mechanisms in cellular fitness [62]. Moreover, the identi-
fication of mutations targeting the regulation of gene expression raises the possibility of the
existence of nonmutational mechanisms for phenotypic compensation of the fitness cost of
antibiotic resistances, as it has been recently described in mycobacteria [63]. Importantly,
although our observations are limited to the set of resistance mutations studied, given that the

 mechanisms involved in their interaction (transcription and translation) are commonly tar-
geted by antibiotics [64,65], these observations likely apply to other resistance mutations. It
will be interesting to study other multiresistant backgrounds in the future in order to test this
possibility.
Resistance mutations typically affect essential cellular functions and more often than not
those mutations tend to exhibit epistasis [28,66]. Indeed, observations in clinical populations
of bacterial pathogens suggest the existence of undiscovered epistatic interactions [67]. Thus,
there is an urgent need to uncover the spectrum of mutations that suppress the costs arising
from epistatic interactions in multidrug-resistant pathogens. Our results suggest that this can-
not be achieved by focusing on the study of single-resistant strains. The ability to identify and
determine how specific mutations affect epistasis between resistant alleles is essential for
understanding how antibiotic resistances persist in bacterial populations. Interestingly, this
knowledge may provide new grounds for the development of novel antimicrobial strategies
that specifically exploit potential weaknesses derived from epistasis between antibiotic resis-
tances in multidrug-resistant bacteria [68].
Materials and methods
Strains and growth conditions
All the strains used in this study (S4 Table) are derivatives of an E. coli K12 MG1655 marked
with constitutively expressed YFPs or CFPs inserted in the galK locus and the entire lac operon
deleted (ΔlacIZYA galK::cat::PLlacO-1-YFP/CFP). Resistant mutants also harbor chromo-
somal-resistance mutations to either streptomycin (RpsLK43T allele), rifampicin (RpoBH526Y
allele), or both. Single- and double-resistance strains in both fluorescent backgrounds were
used in the long-term propagation experiment in Lysogen Broth (LB) without antibiotics. Cul-
tures were grown in a 96-well plate incubator at 37˚C with shaking (700 rpm). Nonfluorescent
wild-type E. coli K12 MG1655 was used as reference strain for the competition fitness assays,
except when specified otherwise.
Experimental evolution for compensation
In order to acclimatize bacteria to the environment, strains were grown separately from frozen
stocks in LB media (150 ul per well) in 96-well plates at 37˚C with shaking (12 replicates per
strain were inoculated in a checkered format to avoid cross-contaminations). After 24 h, 10 ul
of bacteria culture diluted by a factor of 10−2 was transferred into 140 ul fresh LB medium and
allowed to grow for an additional 24 h. Isogenic strains differing only in the marker were
diluted again by a factor of 10−2 and then mixed based on their cell numbers given by the Flow
Cytometer (LSR Fortessa) in order to obtain an initial ratio of 1:1. CFP was excited with a 442
nm laser and measured with a 470/20 nm pass filter. YFP was excited using a 488 nm laser and
measured using a 530/30 nm pass filter. A total of 48 competitions were initiated by inoculat-
ing 140 ul of LB medium with 10 ul of each mixed population, which were allowed to grow for
24 h, reaching a concentration of, approximately, 109 CFU/ml. The separate growths were
done to minimize the occurrence of common compensatory mutations during acclimatization,
a phenomenon that is difficult to avoid. After every 24 h of growth, and for 22 days, these cul-
tures were propagated by serial passage with a constant dilution factor of 10−2 (10 ul of diluted
culture was transferred into 140 ul of fresh medium). In parallel, cell numbers were counted
using the Flow Cytometer in order to measure the frequency of each strain in the mixed popu-
lation during the experiment, by collecting a sample (10 ul) from the spent culture each day.
Samples were frozen at days 5, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 22.

 Competitive fitness assays
The relative fitness of each evolved population at the end of the propagation experiment, at
day 22, was measured by competitive growth against the nonfluorescent (unmarked) isogenic
reference strain E. coli K12 MG1655. The competitor (each evolved population, potentially
composed of both YFP and CFP) and the reference (unmarked) strains were first unfrozen
and acclimatized separately for 48 h (with two growth periods of 24 h) and then mixed in a
proportion of 1:1, using a method similar to the one previously described. To assess the cost of
the resistances themselves before any compensation, control competitions were performed
between the ancestral of each resistant mutant and the reference strain by mixing 25% of YFP
+ 25% of CFP with 50% of the unmarked strain. Thus, a total of 52 competitions were initiated
by inoculating 140 ul of LB media with 10 ul of each mixed population and allowed to compete
for 48 h. The initial and final frequency of the strains were obtained by counting their cell
numbers in the Flow Cytometer. Generation time was estimated from the doubling time of the
reference strain (approximately eight generations), and the fitness was determined as the aver-
age of three independent replicates for each competition.
Sensitivity assay of evolved populations
Evolved cultures were grown in 96-well plates with LB for 24 h and subsequently plated in anti-
biotic-free solid media. From each evolved population, clones were picked with a pipette tip,
which then was used to streak sequentially both on antibiotic plates (containing 100 ug/ml of
rifampicin, streptomycin, or both drugs) and antibiotic-free plates (LB agar only). Clones were
classified as sensitive if they grew on an antibiotic-free media but not on media with antibiotic
(s). Fifty clones were initially tested for each population. Populations in which sensitive clones
were found were subsequently tested for another 150 clones.
Estimation of evolutionary parameters
The method used to estimate the rate of acquisition of beneficial mutations and the distribu-
tion of selective effects was modified from the one published in [36]. Briefly, the method simu-
lates 1 million marker dynamics with parameters (mutation rate, shape, and mean of a gamma
distribution for the selective effects of new mutations) chosen from a uniform distribution.
Afterwards, marker frequency and average population fitness are used to summarize both the
experimental data and the simulated dynamics. These data are used as summary statistics to be
compared by Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC). The modification in the method
done here is that a simple ranking and rejection method was used (instead of using the neural
network function in ABC), in which simulations are ranked by the Euclidean distance between
summary statistics from the simulated and experimental data, and the top 20 simulations are
chosen for the distributions of parameters. This change in the method was required, as the
neural network method failed to provide biological reasonable parameters for the observed
experimental data. We note that, in our estimates, we assumed that mutations can only arise
during the simulated period (t > 0). Thus, we have ignored the short period of acclimatization.
Given the possibility that mutations might have occurred during acclimatization, this could
cause an overestimation of the rate of appearance of beneficial mutations.
DNA extractions
The evolved populations were plated onto LB agar plates and grown for 24 h at 37˚C. One col-
ony, with the most frequent marker, was picked from each population and was grown over-
night into 10 mL of liquid LB, at 37˚C with shaking. The bacterial DNA was then extracted,

 and its concentration and purity were quantified using Qubit and NanoDrop, respectively.
Following quantification, equal concentration of each DNA sample was taken and pooled
together with the clones from the populations of a similar resistant background, resulting in
three pools of DNA (RifR pool with 12 clones, StrR pool with 12 clones, and RifR StrR pool with
24 clones).
Whole-genome sequencing analysis
The DNA extracted was sequenced using the Miseq Illumina platform. Coverage of the differ-
ent pools was as follows: 521x for 12 clones in the RifR pool, 640x for 12 clones in the StrR pool,
and 631x for 24 clones in the RifR StrR pool. The reads were filtered using SeqTk version
1.0-r63. The resulting sequences were analyzed in Breseq version 2.3, using E. coli K12 genome
NC_000913.2 as a reference, and with the polymorphism option selected and the following
parameters: (a) rejection of polymorphisms in homopolymers of a length greater than three,
(b) rejection of polymorphisms that are not present in at least three reads in each strand, and
(c) rejection of polymorphisms that do not have a p-value for quality greater than 0.05. All
other Breseq parameters were used as default. Mutations in homopolymers and pseudogenes
were also discarded. The genomic data in Fig 3 was plotted using the BLAST Ring Image Gen-
erator (BRIG) software [69].
Allelic reconstructions and competitions
The mutations located in nusE and nusG regulatory regions were constructed by Lambda-Red
recombineering [70] using a resistance cassette inserted in a nearby gene (gspB and tufB,
respectively) as a marker for selection, followed by transference to RifR, StrR, and RifR StrR
backgrounds by P1 transduction [71] using the same marker. Derivatives of these strains har-
boring the marker in the nearby gene but not the mutations in nusE and nusG were con-
structed, in order to be used as references in the competition experiments. The putative
compensatory mutations located in rpoC were constructed by pORTMAGE recombineering
[72] in both the RifR and the StrR backgrounds and subsequent transfer to the sensitive, RifR,
StrR, and RifR StrR backgrounds was done by P1 transduction, using as recipient auxotroph
derivatives carrying a mutation in the nearby gene argE and selecting for growth in minimal
medium. The primers used are listed in the S5 Table. The presence of the desired mutations in
the transductant isolates was assessed by PCR-mediated amplification of the corresponding
gene and sequencing. Both reconstructed strains and the corresponding reference strains were
unfrozen and acclimatized during 24 h to avoid compensatory mutations appearing in the
more costly backgrounds. Reconstructed mutants were competed against the respective ances-
tral strain to assess their competitive advantage per generation, assuming the competition lasts
eight generations, or 24 h. The fitness landscapes of the main reconstructed compensatory
genotypes (S4 Fig) were plotted using the MAGELLAN (Maps of Genetical Landscapes) soft-
ware [73].
RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and RT-qPCR
To determine changes in gene expression caused by the mutations in the regulatory regions of
nusE and nusG, RNA extraction from 0.5 ml of cultures at the late exponential phase (OD600
0.6) of isogenic strains harboring, or not, each mutation was performed using a Direct-Zol
RNA miniprep kit (Zymo Research) according to manufacturer’s specifications. Bacterial
RNA was subsequently treated with RQ1 DNase (Promega) according to manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. Reverse transcriptase reaction was performed on 880 ng of RNA, using M-MLV RT
(Promega) and random primers (Promega) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RT-qPCR

 was executed in a Bio-Rad CFX 384 Real-Time PCR Detection System, using iTaq Universal
SYBR green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The cDNA was diluted 200-fold before being used for RT-
qPCR. The cycling conditions were as follows: one step of 10 min at 95˚C and then 40 cycles of
30 s at 95˚C, 30 s at 67˚C, and 30 s at 72˚C. The primers used are listed in the S5 Table. Melt-
ing-curve analysis was performed to verify product homogeneity. All reactions included three
biological replicates for each strain, and three technical replicates for each sample. For analysis,
data were normalized using the algorithm specific for multiple reference genes described by
Hellemans et al. [74], using rrsA and ssrA housekeeping genes as references.
Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination
The MIC of rifampicin and streptomycin in the ancestral and the compensated backgrounds
was determined by using MIC test strips (Liofilchem S.R.L.) in LB agar medium, ranging from
0.016 to 256 μg/ml for rifampicin and from 0.064 to 1,024 μg/ml for streptomycin. The strains
resistant to the maximal concentrations in the MIC test strips were assayed for higher concen-
trations in liquid medium (LB broth), up to 768 μg/ml for rifampicin and 8,192 μg/ml for
streptomycin.
Statistical analysis
The assessment of different slopes for single and double mutants (Fig 1A–1C) was performed
using a One-way ANOVA, corrected with Tukey’s HSD to compare between the different
resistance backgrounds. The significance of the change in competitive fitness (Fig 1D–1F) was
performed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) between the ancestral populations and
the evolved populations at day 5 and GLMEM (with restricted maximum likelihood) for the
fitness changes between day 5 and the end of the experiment (day 22). In both cases, we have
used Hochberg’s adjustment to correct for multiple testing. The differences in estimated rate
of acquisition of beneficial mutations (Fig 2A), and also the differences in their effects (Fig
2B), were analyzed using a two-sample Kolmogorov, adjusted for multiple comparisons using
the Benjamini and Hochberg method [38]. The significance of the fitness effect of compensa-
tory mutations across backgrounds (Fig 4A–4C and Fig 5C) was assessed by ANOVA with
Tukey’s correction for multiple testing. The CIs for classifying a population “sensitive” (or par-
tially sensitive) (S2 Table) were assessed using a Binomial proportion CI on the number of col-
onies assayed that show a sensitive phenotype.

S6 Fig. Frequency marker dynamics and fitness increase in sensitive bacteria. (A) Dynamics
of a fluorescent neutral marker during propagation in rich media without antibiotics of 1:1
mixtures of YFP/CFP cells in 12 independent sensitive E. coli populations. (B) Competitive fit-
ness of the sensitive evolving populations, at different days during adaptation. Each circle cor-
responds to a population with similar colour shown in panels A. Red dashed lines correspond
to the competitive fitness of the sensitive strain. Box plots represent the median and quartiles
Q2 and Q3, and whiskers show the last quartiles of the data. (C) Genetic basis of adaptation of
the sensitive bacteria. Mutations identified through population sequencing in the evolved anti-
biotic sensitive background. Mutations detected at least in one population map at the position
indicated in the circular plot (see also S1 Table).

S7 Fig. The mglA knockout mutation is beneficial in the in the RifR and the RifRStrR back-
grounds. The knockout of mglA is beneficial in the RifR (s = 0.085 (2SEM = 0.035), P = 0.0006)
and RifRStrR (s = 0.106 (2SEM = 0.031), P = 0.008) backgrounds, being neutral in the sensitive
background (s = -0.014 (2SEM = 0.040), P = 0.483) and deleterious in the StrR background (s =
-0.07 (2SEM = 0.031), P = 0.001). Bars indicate the mean effect on fitness and error bars indi-
cate twice the SEM.

S8 Fig. Structure of the RNA polymerase complex, highlighting the location of the
RpoCQ1126K allele. Detail of RNA polymerase showing the β (in blue) and β’ (in brown) sub-
units encoded by the rpoB and the rpoC genes, respectively. The proposed binding area of
NusG N-terminal domain [75–77] is highlighted with a black circle and it partially overlaps
with the DNA binding domain (highlighted with an orange circle). The β’ clamp helices are
crucial for the NusG interaction with RpoC.Residue RpoCQ1126K (in red) is localized in a DNA
binding region domain and maps closely to the proposed binding area of NusG. Figure drawn

 S1 Table. Mutations acquired during the evolution in antibiotic-free media. Mutations are
shown for the 3 different resistant backgrounds, along with the frequency at which they were
detected. Mutations in known compensatory targets are marked in bold.
(XLSX)
S2 Table. Sensitivity assays in the evolved populations. Column “Plated” indicates the total
number of colonies (clones) that were inoculated on agar plates; The total number of those col-
onies that show reversion (i.e., sensitivity) to the antibiotic where they were being tested is
indicated in column “# of Revertants in RIF/STRP/RIF+STREP”. The “Fraction Rev.” columns
summarizes the total fraction of the inoculated clones (between 0 and 1) that became sensitive.
Finally, the last columns, “Bin Err” shows the Binomial confidence interval for the sensitivity
assay, according to the formula z�SQRT((1/n)�p(1-p)). (where z = 1-(1/2)�0.05, for a 95%
confidence interval, n = number of trials and p = ns/n, with ns = number of successes). Popu-
lations were identified as sensitive (or at containing sensitive clones) if the fraction of sensitive
revertants was larger than this error. Populations that show phenotypic sensitivity in all are in
green, when just a fraction of the population is sensitive it is marked as yellow. Phenotypic
assays were performed by replica plating individual clones in the presence of either 100 μg/mL
of Rifampicin, 100 μg/mL of Streptomycin or both of them together (see Materials and Meth-
ods).

S3 Table. MIC of rifampicin and streptomycin in the resistance genotypes harbouring
compensatory mutations. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was assessed for
each resistance genotype reconstructed with a compensatory mutation (either RpoCQ1226K,
nusE or nusG). Neither of the genotypes harbouring compensatory mutations show a differ-
ence in MIC compared to their respective ancestral genotypes.
