Abstract
Objective. Sharp increases in opioid prescriptions,
and associated increases in overdose deaths in the
2000s, evoked widespread calls to change percep-
tions of opioid analgesics. Medical literature dis-
cussions of opioid analgesics began emphasizing
patient and public health hazards. Repetitive expo-
sure to this information may influence physician
assumptions.
While
highly
consequential
to
patients with pain whose function and quality of life
may
benefit
from
opioid
analgesics,
current
assumptions about prescription opioid analgesics,
including their role in the ongoing opioid overdose
epidemic, have not been scrutinized.
Methods. Information was obtained by searching
PubMed, governmental agency websites, and con-
ference proceedings.
Results. Opioid analgesic prescribing and associ-
ated overdose deaths both peaked around 2011 and
are in long-term decline; the sharp overdose in-
crease recorded in 2014 was driven by illicit fentanyl
and heroin. Nonmethadone prescription opioid an-
algesic deaths, in the absence of co-ingested ben-
zodiazepines, alcohol, or other central nervous
system/respiratory
depressants,
are
infrequent.
Within five years of initial prescription opioid mis-
use, 3.6% initiate heroin use. The United States
consumes 80% of the world opioid supply, but opi-
oid access is nonexistent for 80% and severely re-
stricted for 4.1% of the global population.
Conclusions. Many current assumptions about opi-
oid analgesics are ill-founded. Illicit fentanyl and
heroin, not opioid prescribing, now fuel the current
opioid overdose epidemic. National discussion has
often neglected the potentially devastating effects
of uncontrolled chronic pain. Opioid analgesic pre-
scribing and related overdoses are in decline, at
great cost to patients with pain who have benefited
or may benefit from, but cannot access, opioid anal-
gesic therapy.

Introduction
Opioid analgesics remain the most effective drug class
for controlling severe pain, but carry potential for ad-
verse
effects,
misuse,
and
overdose
[1,2].
Sharp
increases in opioid prescriptions, and corresponding
increases in overdose deaths in the 2000s, evoked
widespread reactions to change perceptions of opioid
analgesics. This reaction eventually led to a climate of
polarization [3]. The nature of informational content may
influence physician perceptions; repetitive exposure may
strengthen perceptions into assumptions and conven-
tional wisdom that guide clinical decision-making [4].
While highly consequential to patients whose quality of
life and function benefit from opioid analgesia [3], cur-
rent assumptions about opioid analgesic prescribing
have not been scrutinized. Therefore, these assump-
tions were examined for validity. Data were obtained
from multiple public, including governmental, sources,
as described below. Although an effort was made to
identify all relevant information, inadvertent omission is
possible.
Background
The important role of opioid analgesics is broadly ac-
cepted in acute pain, cancer pain, and palliative/end-

 of-life care, but opioid use in chronic noncancer pain is
controversial, and this debate is polarized [1]. The
2000s witnessed a dramatic increase in prescribing of
opioid analgesics, as well as increases in addiction, di-
version, and fatal overdose [5].
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
identified this pattern; their prompt attention and broad-
casting alerted physicians and the public to this crisis.
The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and CDC closed
“pill mill” conduits for millions of opioid dose units into il-
licit markets. Talking points disseminated through the
media began shifting public perception of opioid analge-
sics away from permissive entitlement and disregard of
risk, such as expecting an opioid prescription for minor
pain or sharing prescribed opioids [6].
The 2011 peaks of opioid analgesic prescribing [7–11]
and overdose [12–14] were followed by multiyear sus-
tained declines, which were not broadcast by the CDC
[5,15,16]. Instead, CDC and media reporting focused
on overuse of opioids for pain and related overdoses,
and reported (not without justification) on opioid analge-
sics as an out-of-control hazard. The plight of patients
with chronic pain who sought relief, or sociomedical
barriers to accessing pain control, were less well publi-
cized. Increased hardships for patients with chronic pain
came while total numbers of deaths attributable to
opioids rose [3]. Propagation by the CDC of one-sided
information on opioid analgesic prescribing fueled sen-
sationalized portrayals of opioid analgesics, prescribers,
and
patients
[3,17–20].
These
portrayals
promoted
stigma
and
misperceptions
of
opioid
analgesics
in
health care and lay populations, with far-reaching con-
sequences [17–21]. Public statements, such as those
by the CDC leadership that “prescription opioids. . .are
no
less
addictive
than
heroin”
have
not
been
helpful [22].
In aggregate, actions by the DEA [23,24] and CDC
[5,15,16], together with media sensationalism [6,17],
have intensified barriers to appropriate access to opioid
analgesics for patients with chronic pain. From 2012 to
2015,
reports
from
Florida,
Georgia,
Indiana,
Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, and Texas described
increasing numbers of physicians refusing to issue opi-
oid prescriptions [25–27] or withdrawing patients from
their stable opioid regimens regardless of pain control
and functional improvement [28]. Pharmacies increas-
ingly
refused
to
fill
prescription
opioid
orders
[24,25,29,30], even for patients with terminal illness and
cancer
pain
[31]
or
acute
postsurgical
pain
[32].
Patients felt criminalized by hostile interactions, such as
being called “drug-seeking addicts” in front of other
pharmacy customers [23,25,29].
Unable to access opioid analgesics, patients previously
stable on opioid regimens were forced into opioid with-
drawal [27,33], the “pharmacy crawl” [23] of trying to lo-
cate a pharmacy willing to fill their prescription during
opioid
withdrawal
or
intense
pain
[23],
repeated
emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations
[24,33], or, for some, suicide [24,33]. The DEA resched-
uling of hydrocodone from CS III to CS II in 2014 ad-
versely impacted patients with chronic pain who had
benefited from this agent. Increasingly, many experi-
enced their prescribed hydrocodone replaced by less
effective analgesics and/or stigma and negative phar-
macy interactions when filling a hydrocodone order.
Some turned to marijuana or borrowed pain medica-
tions for pain control after lost hydrocodone access,
missed work from the ban on refills, or experienced sui-
cidal ideation from blocked efforts to access hydroco-
done or other medication for pain control [34]. It should
be noted that the evidence above, while compelling, is
anecdotal.
When exposed to misinformation and/or covert threats
by drug enforcement or regulatory bodies, physicians
change their opioid prescribing patterns through in-
creased subanalgesic dosing, tapering patients off
opioids, refusing to prescribe opioids or even to see
patients with pain complaints. The improvement of pre-
scribing patterns is best achieved through presentation
of comprehensive and balanced information [6,18,35].
Some experts in pain medicine [19,36–38] have opined
that the 2016 CDC opioid prescribing guideline [16]
falls short of this mark. Longer-term decreases in
physicians’ prescribing of opioids, combined with a
lack of third-party coverage, availability, or efficacy of
nondrug and nonopioid pain therapies, have made ac-
cess to pain control, including opioid analgesics, in-
creasingly difficult if not impossible for patients with
pain [38,39].
Why This Matters: Consequences of Uncontrolled
Chronic Pain
The negative impact of severe chronic pain is hard to
overstate. A pioneer in pain research observed that pro-
longed uncontrolled pain can destroy the quality of life,
the will to live, and drive some patients to suicide [40].
Psychosocial consequences of unmanaged pain can
be severe, with adverse psychological (impaired cogni-
tive function, pathologic anxiety/depression, suicidal
ideation, despair, hopelessness) and social/interper-
sonal (relationship disruption, loss of employment/fi-
nancial ruin) outcomes [1,39,41–44]. The following
sequelae underscore the gravity of poorly controlled
chronic pain.
Suicide
Chronic pain is second only to bipolar disorder as a
medical cause of suicide [45–47]. The distress, exhaus-
tion, and hopelessness of chronic unrelieved pain can
invite intended overdose. Death is no longer feared, but
instead, becomes a welcome prospect of permanent re-
lief from suffering and anguish [18,48].

 Premature Death
Of 6,940 primary care patients followed over 10 years,
the mortality risk from poorly controlled moderate to
severe chronic pain was 68% greater than from cardio-
vascular disease and 49% greater than all other causes
combined [49].
Neurotoxicity
Chronic
undercontrolled
pain
is
associated
with
peripheral and central nervous system (CNS) neuro-
plastic alteration [50]. Chronic pain-induced neuro-
plasticity
can
activate
CNS
glial
cells
and
other
neurotoxic pathways, leading to neuroinflammation,
tissue destruction, and loss of CNS tissue mass and
receptors, with resultant loss of opioid and other anal-
gesic response [51,52]. Patients may require high
doses
of
opioids
to
attain
a
modest
analgesic
response sufficient to reduce suffering and suicide
risk [52].
Degraded Quality of Life
The negative impact of chronic pain on quality of life
(QOL) is more severe than heart failure, renal failure, or
major depression [53] and is comparable with the QOL
of patients dying of cancer [54].
Self-Medication
Negative attitudes of primary care (PC) and other clini-
cians toward patients with chronic pain who use illicit
substances or misuse prescribed drugs are wide-
spread due to presumption of hedonistic pursuit.
Reality may be more complex, and patients with
chronic pain may use substances to alleviate poorly
controlled pain. This possibly was explored in a study
of nearly 600 adult PC clinic patients who tested posi-
tive for illicit or nonprescribed prescription drugs. Of
these patients, 87% reported chronic pain (13% mild,
24% moderate, 50% severe); 74% reported impair-
ment from pain (15% mild, 23% moderate, 36% se-
vere); 51% of 576 patients who used illicit drugs
(marijuana, heroin) did so to treat pain; 81% of 121
patients who misused prescription drugs did so to
self-medicate pain; and 38% of 265 patients who
reported
past-three-month
heavy
drinking
did
so
to control pain, as did 79% of 57 high-risk alcohol
users [55].
With nearly one-third of study patients reporting both
severe pain and disabling impairment, this study sug-
gests that significant pain is quite prevalent in PC
patients with positive drug screens. Poor pain control
was common; self-medication to alleviate pain may
have driven apparent substance use disorder (SUD) in
this study population [55].
Assumptions Informing the Current Opioid Debate:
Fallacies or Facts?
Safety is the foundation of opioid analgesic prescribing
and a basic principle of good medical practice [56], but
misinformation has influenced current assumptions of
opioid analgesic prescribing safety, risk, and efficacy.
These assumptions are dispelled by data; some are
unreported
or
obscured.
In
the
discussion
below,
“prescriptions” refers to total outpatient retail pharmacy–
dispensed prescriptions.
Opioid Analgesic Prescribing Rates
Misperception: Continued increases in opioid analgesic
prescribing fuel the opioid epidemic.
Fact: Hydrocodone, oxycodone, and overall opioid pre-
scribing have been in multiyear decline beginning in
2012 through early 2017.
Hydrocodone Short Acting (SA) was rescheduled to CS
II from CS III in October 2014. One year later, prescrip-
tions decreased 22%, and dispensed tablets 16% [7].
Hydrocodone SA prescriptions decreased 33% from
2011
(144.5
million)
to
2015
(97
million)
[8,9].
Hydrocodone
extended-release
(ER)
accounted
for
<1% of ER opioid prescriptions in 2015 [57], suggesting
minimal
contribution
to
trends
in
hydrocodone
prescribing.
Oxycodone ER also showed steady decreases in pre-
scribing, including a 39% decrease in a health plan with
31.3 million adult members from late 2009 to late 2012
[58]. Nationwide data on oxycodone ER comparing
2009 with 2013 [10] found decreases in: national poison
center surveillance system mentions (48%), mentions in
a national drug treatment system (32%), prescribing us-
ing a claims database (27%), doctor shopping (50%),
and fatal overdose reported to the manufacturer (65%)
[10].
Total
oxycodone
ER
prescriptions
decreased
>29.7% from 2007 (>8 million) to 2011 (5.7 million) [59]
and decreased 39% from 2010 to 2015 [11].
In a parallel trend, methadone prescriptions decreased
28% from 2010 to 2015 [11]. Prescriptions for transmu-
cosal immediate-release fentanyl decreased 39% from
2011 (147,322) to 2015 (90,556) [60]. Total opioid anal-
gesic prescriptions decreased 4.5% from 2011 to 2014,
despite increases in tramadol (þ25.5%) and buprenor-
phine (þ49.4%) prescriptions [9]. Total dispensed mor-
phine dose equivalents decreased 18.7% from 2010/
fourth quarter (Q4; 68.5 million) to 2015/Q4 (55.7 million)
[12]. The US proportion of world consumption de-
creased for oxycodone from 2000 (92.8%) to 2011
(81.0%) and 2014 (73.1%), and decreased for fentanyl
from 2003 (56.9%) to 2009 (42.8%) and 2014 (30.1%)
[12,61,62].
During a May 2016 FDA Advisory Committee workshop,
the question was raised of how to interpret multiyear
Opioid Crisis: Assumptions vs Facts
795

 declines in opioid analgesic prescribing in light of CDC
data that show continued increases in prescription opi-
oid analgesic overdoses [11]. The data below resolve
this apparent contradiction.
Opioid Analgesic Overdose Fatalities: Incidence and
Trends
Misperception: Prescription opioid analgesic overdose
(OD) deaths soared in 2014 and continue to increase.
Fact: Fatal prescription opioid analgesic ODs have
steadily declined since 2011; in contrast to earlier
reports [63–66], the 2014 increase was not due to pre-
scription opioid analgesics [67,68].
The CDC classifies opioids as: 1) natural (morphine, co-
deine) and semisynthetic (oxycodone, hydrocodone) opi-
oid
analgesics;
2)
methadone;
3)
nonmethadone
synthetic opioid analgesics (fentanyl, tramadol); and 4) il-
licit opioids (heroin). Groups 1–3 can be combined as
opioid analgesics or prescription opioids, distinct from il-
licit opioids [5,13].
In late 2013, illicit Chinese fentanyl surged into US
drug
markets
through
Mexico,
and
fentanyl
ODs
soared in 2014. Subsequently, direct import from
China expanded to include Internet crypto-markets
and the ultrapotent fentanyl analog carfentanil [69].
The CDC decided in early 2014 to continue recording
fentanyl overdoses as prescription opioid analgesic
overdoses, stating that toxicology cannot distinguish
illicit from diverted pharmaceutical fentanyl [12]. In
March 2016, a CDC Injury Center webpage stated
that the 2014 spike in opioid analgesic overdoses
were primarily driven by fentanyl, almost entirely illicit
in origin. The 2014 figures were corrected retroac-
tively by removing overdoses involving synthetic opi-
oid
analgesics
other
than
methadone
(fentanyl,
tramadol) [13]. The revised figures indicated approxi-
mately
14,000
ODs
involving
prescription
opioid
analgesics. This policy was changed in 2016 to de-
aggregate
fentanyl
from
other
prescription
opioid
analgesics [68].
Prescribing patterns of dispensed fentanyl dose units (in
millions) in 2014 (6.7) and 2013 (6.8) were unchanged
[9], and nearly all fentanyl involved in fatal opioid ODs is
illicit and not diverted [70]. The same CDC Injury Center
webpage stated that the corrected 2014 figure of
�14,000 was “an increase. . .of 693 since 2013,” or
roughly 13,650 nonfentanyl opioid analgesic overdoses.
The purpose or method of this 2013 revision was ab-
sent. The cited reference, the Wide-Ranging Online
Data for Epidemiologic Research (WONDER) database,
is a public-access CDC database [13]. Other CDC
releases show differing figures. Recent opioid analgesic
overdose figures by the CDC are inconsistent; these are
presented in Table 1.
In 2013, heroin was detected in 1,342 (10%) of opioid
analgesic fatalities, increasing to 26% in 2014 [5,66].
However, heroin ODs may be misclassified as morphine
ODs. The metabolite 6-monoaceytlmorphine (6-MAM) is
unique to heroin, but rapidly metabolizes into morphine.
Some medical examiners may be reluctant to label a
death heroin-related without 6-MAM present; because
morphine is present, the cause of death is listed as
morphine, not heroin [71].
The CDC bases their opioid overdose statistics on all-
cause overdose. The US Government Accountability
Office (GAO) reported prescription opioid analgesic fatal-
ities from 2003–2008 by searching the National Vital
Statistics System (NVSS) database used by the CDC for
overdose and other statistics. In published overdose
data, the CDC includes all causes (unintentional, sui-
cide, homicide, undetermined) leading to death. In this
report, GAO limited their results to unintentional (acci-
dental) overdose leading to death. Compared with pub-
lished CDC data [72], GAO data for accidental fatal
overdose in 2003–2008 were 20–24% lower—not an in-
significant difference (Table 2) [73]. Opioid analgesic
overdoses of undetermined cause include accidental
overdoses of unknown proportion. The nature of acci-
dental (vs intentional) overdose death may evoke a
stronger visceral response to a greater danger and has
driven
the
backlash
against
opioid
prescribing.
Overdose calculation methods are stated in the techni-
cal sections or footnoted fine print of CDC publications,
and so may not be noticed by readers. The GAO report
is not current, but Table 2 suggests a stable ratio be-
tween all-cause vs accidental opioid analgesic deaths.
Importantly, within-state trends can diverge from nation-
wide trends discussed in this paper. Utah is an exam-
ple, where
fatal opioid analgesic overdoses began
increasing in 2011, persisting into 2016 [74].
Opioid Analgesics as Causative Agent in Overdose
Fatalities
Misperception: Fatal ODs reflect the inherent lethality of
opioid analgesics.
Fact: Opioid analgesics are infrequently the sole cause
of fatal overdose.
Recent data demonstrate that fatal opioid analgesic
ODs primarily result from either methadone or the com-
bination of opioids and benzodiazepines of other CNS
depressants [21,75]. The extent that co-ingested agents
have driven overdose rates is little reported in the me-
dia. Data from 2011, when prescription opioid analgesic
deaths peaked, is used as a reference point when rele-
vant. Primary contributors to fatal opioid analgesic over-
dose are the following.
Methadone prescribing for pain began in the late 1990s,
and overdose fatalities increased from 784 in 1999 to
Rose

 5,518 in 2007, decreasing to 4,418 in 2011 and 3400
in 2014 [76,77]. Methadone accounted for a dispropor-
tionately large share of fatal prescription opioid analgesic
toxicities in 2007 (38%), decreasing in 2011 (26%) and
2014 (24%) [76,77]. Fatal methadone overdoses were
fueled by prescriber inexperience with the complex
pharmacology,
and
its
designation
as
the
firstline
chronic pain opioid by insurer/third-party payers on the
sole basis of cost savings [78]. For example, methadone
5-mg tablets, taken three times daily, cost an average
of $17 per month in 2012, compared with $306 per
month for branded oxycodone (ER 40 mg taken twice
daily) [79].
Benzodiazepines (BZDs) contributed to 31% of opioid
analgesic fatalities in 2011 (vs 18.4% in 2004), accord-
ing to the CDC [80], but this may understate their true
contribution. A Canadian study evaluated 607,156 peo-
ple aged 15–64 years. Of those prescribed opioids for
pain who died of opioid analgesic toxicity, coprescribed
BZDs were detected at death in 84.5% [81]. In a state-
wide study of 2,182,374 North Carolina residents who
received one or more opioid analgesic prescriptions in
2010, BZDs were present in 61.4% who fatally over-
dosed on their prescribed opioid. Compared with opioid
OD alone, opioid þ BZD OD rates were 2.8 times
greater in persons taking <75.0 mg/d in morphine-
equivalent dose (MED) and 45.8 times greater in those
taking >300 mg/d MED [75]. In contrast to opioid anal-
gesics, dispensed BZD prescriptions increased 226%
from
2009
(40.9
million)
to
2014
(133.4
million).
Increases were comparable for the top three prescribed
BZDs (alprazolam, clonazepam, lorazepam) [82].
In 2014, alcohol contributed to OD deaths where the
following opioids were present: fentanyl (12.2%), heroin
(20.7%), hydrocodone (17.2%), morphine (13.0%), and
oxycodone (16.7%). Alcohol contribution to opioid OD
deaths is likely underestimated [83]. Concurrent heroin
and prescription opioid detection by toxicology testing
in fatal overdose creates uncertainty over the relative
contribution of each agent to death. In such cases, the
OD is recorded as both a prescription opioid OD and a
heroin OD [67].
Between 2000 and 2010, when fatal respiratory depres-
sion occurred, it typically developed during the first five
days of opioid therapy initiation, with the highest rates in
the initial 24 hours [84]. Opioid initiation at too high a
starting dose, or failure to consider other risk factors for
respiratory

 sedatives, indicate prescriber knowledge deficits [84].
Also
during
2000–2010,
equianalgesic
dose
tables
(EDT) were commonly used in opioid switching to deter-
mine dose equivalence between original and replace-
ment opioids. EDT use increased as more patients with
chronic pain were prescribed opioids. With EDT calcula-
tions generally based upon observations in opioid-naı
¨ve
postsurgical patients administered single-dose opioids
and other flaws and limitations, EDT use was associated
with increased fatal opioid toxicity [85].
Prescription Opioid Analgesic Abuse and Heroin
Initiation
Misperception: Prescription opioid analgesics are the
gateway to heroin.
Fact: Progression from prescription opioid abuse to her-
oin initiation is infrequent.
Data from 609,000 persons at risk for nonmedical pain
reliever use (NMPR; use of any nonprescribed opioid
analgesic, prescribed opioid analgesic use departing
from intended purpose) or heroin initiation during 2002–
2011 indicated that 3.6% of NMPR users initiated heroin
within five years of prescribed opioid abuse onset [86].
Most current heroin users initially abuse prescription
opioids [69], but the unreported flipside is the infrequent
progression of NMPR to heroin [86].
A Cochrane Review evaluated 26 prospective opioid tri-
als in subjects with chronic pain (N ¼ 4893; opioid ther-
apy for six or more months) with prior nonopioid
analgesic failure [87]. In studies specifically reporting
abuse or addiction rates (N ¼ 2613), seven patients
(0.27%) developed opioid use disorder (OUD) of their
prescribed opioid. Most studies screened subjects for
SUD history, and all subjects were prescribed opioids
under long-term medical supervision. The low OUD
rates may not generalize to unselected populations or to
opioid prescribing without adequate medical supervision
[87]. Another systematic review using less restrictive
study inclusion evaluated opioid therapy outcomes in
subjects with chronic pain, with or without SUD history
(17 studies; N ¼ 88,235). Opioid treatment was long-
term (three months to several years) in 10 studies,
short-term (one study), or unreported (six studies).
The incidence rates of OUD ranged from 0–24% (me-
dian ¼ 0.5%), and the prevalence rates ranged from
0–31% (median ¼ 4.5%). Studies with a greater propor-
tion of subjects with SUD history reported higher OUD
rates [88].
Proportion of US to World Consumption of Opioid
Analgesics
Misperception: The United States consumes 80% of the
world opioid supply and 99% of the hydrocodone sup-
ply, proving that opioid overprescribing is rampant.
Fact: These often-cited figures mislead by omission.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has calculated
that of the world’s population (7 billion in 2010), 7.6%
live in countries with adequate access to opioid analge-
sics (US, Canada, Australia, some Western European
countries), 4.1% live in countries with moderately inade-
quate access, and 80% (5.8 billion) have nearly or en-
tirely nonexistent access [89]. The WHO calls this
unavailability of opioids for severe pain an epidemic and
declares global access to opioid analgesics a moral im-
perative [90]. The United States uses 99% of hydroco-
done because other countries with adequate opioid
access prefer dihydrocodeine or low-dose morphine to
hydrocodone for moderate to moderately severe pain
[91]. Compared with opioid analgesic access in the
United States, access is greater in Canada and compa-
rable in Austria [89].
From 2010/Q3 to 2014/Q4, decreased rates were found
of opioid analgesic misuse reported to poison centers
when adjusted by 1) population: –44% ER/LA opioids,
–31% SA opioids; 2) prescription: –44% ER/LA opioids,
–25% SA opioids; and 3) dosing unit: –37% ER/LA
opioids, –25% SA opioids [92].
Evidence of Long-term Opioid Benefit in Chronic Pain
Misperception: There is no evidence that long-term
opioids are safe or effective.
Fact: Few if any analgesic drugs used in chronic pain
have evidence of long-term safety and efficacy from ran-
domized controlled trials (RCTs) of one or more years’
duration.
This talking point to discredit opioid prescribing in
chronic pain comes from recent AHRQ [14] and CDC
[16] reviews of long-term opioid analgesic therapy that
found
few
RCTs
of
one
or
more
years’
duration
comparing opioid pain or function outcomes with an-
other analgesic or placebo. This phrase misleads with
strongly biased wording and omitted information; no
recommended nonopioid therapy for chronic pain has
longer aggregate clinical trial duration than opioids, and
all
modalities
show
aggregate
study
durations
�12 weeks [93]. Absence of evidence is not evidence of
absence [94]. Bias-neutral wording may resemble “few
controlled long-term opioid safety and efficacy studies in
chronic pain have been published.” Opioid and other
analgesic
drug
RCTs
are
seldom
evaluated
for
>12 weeks. Obstacles that interfere with conduct of
long-term RCTs for drug and nondrug treatments in-
clude ethical prohibition of assigning subjects in sub-
stantial pain to placebo, the complexity, expense, and
unattractiveness to industry funding of long-term trials
using active-drug controls, and high dropout rates of
subjects in chronic pain randomized to receive placebo
or sham interventions [95–97].

 Opioid analgesic efficacy is especially difficult to demon-
strate in controlled RCTs. Studies report average opioid
responses of large numbers of patients receiving rigid,
predetermined starting doses and titration [48]. Opioid
response in chronic pain is bimodal and not normally
distributed [94]; patients primarily show substantial or
negligible analgesic response. With individual patient
responses pooled and averaged, modest benefit is typi-
cally reported [94]. Strict, inflexible dosing parameters or
titration algorithms lead to high dropout rates from anal-
gesic failure or intolerability, resulting in underestimates
of efficacy and overestimates of toxicity. Many such
patients would likely gain analgesia and tolerability using
an individualized approach tailored to patient factors
that influence the analgesic response to opioids [48,96].
Moreover, non-RCT opioid analgesic trials of one or
more years demonstrate substantive clinical value [95].
Other Factors Related to Opioid Analgesic
Prescribing Safety
Medical cannabis laws were examined for potential im-
pact on fatal opioid analgesic OD during 1999 to 2010
[98]. Compared with states without medical cannabis
laws, states that enacted medical cannabis laws before
2011 (N ¼ 13) showed a mean 24.8% reduction in annual
opioid analgesic OD fatalities. The relationship between
access to medical cannabis (vs states without access)
and reductions in opioid analgesic OD deaths was evi-
dent one year after the passage of medical cannabis
laws, and it strengthened over time: year 1 (–19.9%),
year 2 (–25.2%), year 3 (–23.6%), year 4 (–20.2%), year 5
(–33.7%), and year 6 (–33.3%). Reductions in opioid anal-
gesic deaths in states with (vs without) medical cannabis
access were statistically significant for each year (range
¼ P < 0.001 to P ¼ 0.02). The association between medi-
cal cannabis laws and opioid analgesic deaths remained
after including all heroin OD deaths, even when opioid
analgesics were not present. In states with medical can-
nabis laws, there was no relationship between opioid an-
algesic OD deaths two years before passage and one
year before passage [98].
Liberalized
opioid
analgesic
prescribing
in
some
European countries has not led to the addiction and
overdose rates seen in the United States [61,99]. This
disparity was thought to reflect the contribution of
uniquely American factors beyond opioid analgesic ex-
posure that include preferential insurance coverage for
drug over nondrug chronic pain therapies and aggres-
sive pharmaceutical industry marketing of ER opioids
[100]. For example, of 870,000 German health insur-
ance enrollees in 2012, the one-year prevalence of pre-
scribed opioid analgesic problems (fatal overdose, ED
visits, OUD diagnosis) was 0.008% [101].
The CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline for Chronic
Pain
In March 2016, the CDC published an opioid prescrib-
ing guideline for chronic pain in primary care [16]. Of its
12 recommendations, most represent standard practice,
including risk mitigation strategies. A minority of these
recommendations, however, provoked intense criticism
and alarm by pain professionals and patient advocacy
groups,
and
concerns
by
the
American
Medical
Association
[102],
American
Cancer
Society
[103],
American Academy of Pain Management [37], American
Academy of Pain Medicine [36], and other organizations
[104]. The CDC guidelines have already begun to have
a major impact on opioid prescribing. Nonetheless, they
perpetuate the misperceptions of opioid analgesics dis-
cussed above. Discussion of specific recommendations
is beyond the scope of this paper, but aspects of the
development process merit closer attention, as this
shaped the contents of the end product [37,105].
Guideline recommendations can be influenced by the
opinions,
experience,
and
makeup
of the
Guideline
Development Group (GDG). Instead of placing patient
needs as the priority, practices can be regulated to con-
trol costs, serve societal needs, or protect special inter-
ests [106]. Much of the opposition to the CDC guideline
reflected the perception that it was not patient-centered.
As both a public health and clinical issue, the prescrib-
ing
of
opioid
analgesics
must
balance
access
for
patients who benefit with control to prevent inappropri-
ate use. Emphasis on access over control was associ-
ated
with
increased
prescribing,
addiction,
and
overdose. The current focus on control has added or
reinforced barriers to patient access. Well-intentioned
but narrowly targeted, unbalanced interventions to such
complex issues generate consequences [104].
Of the 17 members of the CDC GDG, 15 were emer-
gency medicine, addiction, public health, or state regu-
latory professionals [16]. The remaining two members
with pain profession backgrounds are discussed below.
On November 17, 2015, the directors of a public
interest law firm sent a letter of concern to the two top
officials of the CDC regarding what was then the draft
of
the
CDC
opioid
guideline
[105].
The
law
firm
requested that the CDC withdraw this draft guideline
and start over after protections for the treatment of
patients with pain were in place and a new GDG was
created. The law firm expressed greatest concern over
the following [105]:
1. the CDC did not initially disclose author and advisor
backgrounds and credentials;
2. the GDG comprised members whose public records
indicated strong support for restrictive prescribing
guidelines that would significantly reduce opioid pre-
scriptions for patients suffering from chronic pain;
3. stakeholders whose views diverged from the GDG’s
were apparently excluded;
4. conflicts of interest were present among GDG mem-
bers.

 members
of
Physicians
for
Responsible
Opioid
Prescribing (PROP), an activist group dedicated to
limiting the use of opioid analgesics. PROP lobbied
Congress and federal regulators for years to reduce
opioid prescribing. One GDG member was elected
president of PROP in 2015 and served as a paid
consultant to a law firm that litigates against opioid
analgesic manufacturers.
Also instrumental in developing the guidelines were the
PROP
founder
and
Executive
Director,
and
PROP
Board members who were Stakeholder Review Group
members who reviewed the CDC guidelines. Another
PROP board member was on the CDC peer review
panel [107]. The law firm observed that this represented
serious ideological and financial conflicts of interest
[105]. The CDC’s understandable framing of all opioids
as vectors of an epidemic influenced its selection of
GDG members [37].
Review committee bias and stakeholder representation
can influence the conclusions of systematic reviews
[108], including those that inform guidelines. This is evi-
dent when separate reviews draw different conclusions
from analyzing the same pool of clinical trial data [109].
As described above, the CDC guidelines were based on
a 2014 AHRQ systematic review [14] that excluded opi-
oid RCTs of less than one year’s duration and all opioid
studies other than RCT design. These new criteria elimi-
nated the pool of evaluable studies analyzed in a 2009
systematic
review
of
opioid
analgesics
[110]
co-
authored by some of the PROP members who authored
the CDC guidelines. The conclusions of the 2014 AHRQ
review and the 2016 CDC guidelines differed markedly
from the 2009 review, despite little or no change in the
body of best available evidence [37].
Despite the above flaws, the authority and prestige of
the CDC guideline have already led to its implementa-
tion as a mandate. This outcome is expected to further
restrict opioid access for patients in need [21,37,38].
Unfortunately, although opioid analgesics certainly pos-
sess abuse liability, few other options are equally effec-
tive when pain is severe and requires powerful analgesic
control [2].
Discussion
This paper examined the factual basis supporting or re-
futing common assumptions about opioid analgesic pre-
scribing. Publically available data on opioid analgesic
prescribing show long-term decline and corresponding
decline in ODs. When taken as prescribed and not
combined with sedatives and/or alcohol, fatal OD is in-
frequent. Population-wide, misusing prescription opioid
analgesics infrequently leads to heroin use. Importantly,
recent data show a fundamental shift in the “opioid
overdose epidemic” away from prescription opioid anal-
gesics and toward illicit opioids (heroin and fentanyl).
To illustrate this dramatic change, a February 2017 re-
port on Massachusetts data indicated
that opioid-
related deaths/100,000 residents increased 250% from
9.3 in 2011 to 25.8 in 2015. Toxicology results in opioid
OD decedents found important trends: 1) fentanyl, al-
most all illicit in origin, was present in 42% in 2014 vs
75% in 2016; 2) heroin, present in 77% in mid-2014 vs
�50% in 2016; 3) prescription opioid analgesics fell
34.68% from early 2014 to 2016; and 4) BZD presence
rose from 55% in 2014 to 63% in 2016. Unlike the CDC
methods, suicides were excluded in these analyses.
Thus, in 2016, 3 in 4 fatal opioid toxicities involved illicit
fentanyl, approximately three in five involved BZDs, and
prescription opioid analgesic fatalities continued declin-
ing [111]. It is worth noting that, in light of an earlier
scandal involving years of falsified drug testing results
by one chemist in the Massachusetts state toxicology
laboratory, this chemist’s behavior was uncovered and
dealt with well before the earliest of the above results
was obtained [112].
Solutions to opioid analgesic overprescribing, increasing
overdose, and overpermissive attitudes in the 2000s
were driven by the DEA’s and CDC’s respective drug
and disease control paradigms. For example, in late
2016, the DEA announced a mandated 25% production
rollback of all Schedule II opioids (33% for hydrocodone)
in 2017, relative to 2016 levels [113]. These rollbacks
did not apparently reflect any considerations of clinical
need. Yet, patients with chronic pain requiring opioid
analgesia increasingly encounter blocked access to pain
control, stigma, and hostility in the health care system.
Patients with cancer pain or acute pain have not
been spared [18,20,24,33,35,114]. The disconnect of
authorities and regulators from physicians and their
patients with chronic pain who benefit from opioids is
obvious [62].
Lobbying by advocates of opioid prescribing restrictions
may contribute to proposals advocating blanket restric-
tions on access to opioid analgesics regardless of indi-
vidual patient need. Some advocates are motivated by
the tragedy of losing a loved one to prescription opioid
toxicity or OUD that began during opioid analgesic ther-
apy. One can appreciate the pain they experienced and
their desire to spare others the fate of their relative.
However, unidimensional solutions to complex public
health
issues
often
yield
undesired
consequences.
Suicide by patients with chronic pain unable to access,
or cut off from, opioid pain relief may come to rival fatal
prescription opioid analgesic overdoses [115–117].
Opioid analgesic prescribing has received greater media
attention than other drug classes or prescribing patterns
linked to highly concerning outcomes. This negative at-
tention may reflect the corrosive effects of OUD upon
families and society. In contrast, inappropriate antibiotic
overprescribing is the single greatest contributor to
antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Recent estimates indicate
that more than 2 million Americans are afflicted annually,
with
23,000
fatalities
[118].

 infection resulting from antibiotic use, annually afflicts
around 500,000 and kills 15,000 [119]. The CDC guide-
line
endorses
nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory
drug
(NSAID) use before considering opioids [16], but every
year, NSAIDs cause 7,000 to 10,000 fatalities from gas-
trointestinal hemorrhage [120].
Many unsafe opioid prescribing practices and overdose
risk factors have been identified over the past two deca-
des, yet until new analgesics enter clinical use, and there
are few alternatives to opioids for controlling severe pain,
and none that are widely available. The National Pain
Strategy recommends that pain management in our
health care system be improved by pain education of
patients and pain training of clinicians [121]. When pre-
scribed judiciously with careful attention to possible co-
morbid psychiatric, substance use, or medical disorders
and potential adverse drug interactions [4], morbidity and
mortality associated with prescription opioid analgesics,
including overdosage, can be reduced, and in fact have
steadily declined since peaking in 2011. In contrast, the
recent upsurge in opioid-related deaths is attributable to
the illicit opioids fentanyl and heroin. This pattern of over-
dose fatality is unlikely to respond to regulation of access
to medically prescribed opioid analgesics.
