Abstract
Aims
To determine clinical outcomes and explore prognostic factors related to ulcer healing in people with a clinically
infected diabetic foot ulcer.
Methods
This multicentre, prospective, observational study reviewed participants’ data at 12 months after culture of a
diabetic foot ulcer requiring antibiotic therapy. From participants’ notes, we obtained information on the incidence of
wound healing, ulcer recurrence, lower extremity amputation, lower extremity revascularization and death. We
estimated the cumulative incidence of healing at 6 and 12 months, adjusted for lower extremity amputation and death
using a competing risk analysis, and explored the relationship between baseline factors and healing incidence.
Results
In the first year after culture of the index ulcer, 45/299 participants (15.1%) had died. The ulcer had healed in 136
participants (45.5%), but recurred in 13 (9.6%). An ipsilateral lower extremity amputation was recorded in 52 (17.4%)
and revascularization surgery in 18 participants (6.0%). Participants with an ulcer present for ~2 months or more had a
lower incidence of healing (hazard ratio 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.77), as did those with a PEDIS (perfusion, extent, depth,
infection, sensation) perfusion grade of ≥2 (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55). Participants with a single ulcer on
their index foot had a higher incidence of healing than those with multiple ulcers (hazard ratio 1.90, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.06).
Conclusions
Clinical outcomes at 12 months for people with an infected diabetic foot ulcer are generally poor. Our
data confirm the adverse prognostic effect of limb ischaemia, longer ulcer duration and the presence of multiple ulcers.

Introduction
One of the most common and serious complications of
diabetes mellitus is the development of a foot ulcer, which
occurs in up to a quarter of patients over their lifetime [1].
These diabetic foot ulcers, which primarily result from
peripheral nerve damage and arterial disease, are associated
with substantial morbidity, often including hospitalization
and lower extremity amputation, as well as increased
mortality [2]. These complications also lead to substantial
healthcare costs and loss of productivity [3–5]. Over half of
diabetic foot ulcers are clinically infected at presentation [6],
and these infected diabetic foot ulcers are especially associ-
ated with poor outcomes [7–12].
Understanding factors associated with diabetic foot ulcer
healing may better inform prevention and management
strategies. Prospective data on clinical outcomes of infected
diabetic foot ulcer are scarce. Two large inception cohort
studies [5,13–15] assessed factors associated with diabetic
foot ulcer healing, but neither specifically recruited people
with infected ulcers and both were limited to specialist
centres. Ince et al. [13] and Jeffcoate et al. [14] found that
among people attending one diabetic foot ulcer clinic for
whom there was a 1-year follow-up, there was a relationship
between time to healing and ulcer area, peripheral arterial
disease, ulcer site and diabetes duration. The European Study
Group on Diabetes and the Lower Extremity (Eurodiale)

 study [5,15] in people with a new diabetic foot ulcer
presenting to one of 14 diabetic foot ulcer clinics, and for
whom there was a 1-year follow-up, identified independent
predictors of delayed healing as: older age;, male sex; larger
ulcer size; heart failure; inability to stand or walk without
help; end-stage renal disease; peripheral neuropathy; and
peripheral arterial disease [15]. Current guidelines for the
management of infected diabetic foot ulcer [16–20] highlight
the importance of prevention, early diagnosis and appropri-
ate therapy delivered by a multidisciplinary team.
Our group recently completed a large, multicentre, cross-
sectional study that compared culture results from swab and
tissue specimens concurrently obtained from people with a
diabetic foot ulcer with suspected infection (the Concordance
in Diabetic Foot Ulcer Infection [CODIFI] study) [21]. This
study collected comprehensive clinical details, including ulcer
classification using both the PEDIS (perfusion, extent, depth,
infection, sensation) [22] and the Wagner systems, and
wound culture results. After gaining additional funding we
obtained consent from participants to enrol them in a
prospective observational study to assess the 12-month
clinical outcomes of people with a clinically infected diabetic
foot ulcer and to explore prognostic factors related to the
incidence of wound healing.
Methods
Study design and participants
The
CODIFI
study
enrolled
400
participants
between
November 2011 and May 2013. Participants were recruited
from community podiatry-led and multi-disciplinary diabetic
foot ulcer clinics. Eligibility criteria were: diagnosis of
diabetes mellitus; foot ulcer suspected of being infected
based on clinical signs and symptoms using Infectious
Diseases Society of America/International Working Group
on the Diabetic Foot [16,20] criteria and clinical judgement;
plan to treat with antibiotics for their infected ulcer; and age
≥ 18 years with written consent provided.
Mid-way
through
recruitment,
we
obtained
ethics
approval for an amendment (November 2012) to enable us
to conduct a case note review at 12 months after CODIFI
study enrolment. This allowed us to obtain consent prospec-
tively from all subsequently enrolled participants for the 12-
month case note review and retrospectively from those
previously enrolled in CODIFI who were still alive (by
telephone using an ethically approved verbal consent script).
We also obtained ethics approval to perform the case note
review for enrolled participants who had since died.
Assessments/case note review
At enrolment for the CODIFI study [21] we recorded the
following data: baseline demographics; diabetes history;
clinical ulcer details (wound duration and site, aetiology,
PEDIS and Wagner classification); type, if any, of antibiotic
or antimicrobial treatment; and culture results from swab
and tissue samples taken from the ulcer.
For the 12-month outcome assessment, research nurses or
podiatrists at each participating centre conducted a detailed
case note review seeking information on participant status
and outcomes relating to the index ulcer, including: whether
or not it healed, and if so, the date of healing; index ulcer
recurrence; ipsilateral lower limb revascularization proce-
dures; ipsilateral lower extremity amputation; or death in the
12 months following enrolment.
Statistical analysis
Sample size
We expected to obtain consent from at least 200 partici-
pants. Assuming a diabetic foot ulcer healing rate of 50%,
this would provide an estimate of healing with a precision
(half width of the 95% CI) of � 6.9%. It would also allow us
to include a maximum of 10 parameter estimates in an
exploratory prognostic model of time to healing [23].
Population
Analyses were conducted on the follow-up population, which
consisted of the sample of all registered and consented
CODIFI participants for whom a subsequent case note
review was completed. To explore the generalizability of our
results, baseline characteristics of all CODIFI participants
included vs not included in the follow-up population were
compared, with differences explored using the chi-squared
and t-test as appropriate.
12-month outcomes
We summarized the outcome of study participants by ulcer-
related events (wound healing, wound recurrence, lower
What’s new?
• This is the first prospective study to estimate the
incidence of healing and prognostic factors associated
with healing in people with a clinically infected diabetic
foot ulcer, and specifically in the presence of competing
risks of amputation and death.
• Outcomes for people with a clinically infected diabetic
foot ulcer are poorer than previously thought; in the
first year after presentation with an infected ulcer,
15.1% of our participants had died and 17.4% under-
went at least partial lower extremity amputation.
• Healing incidence within 1 year was 44.5% (95% CI 38.9
to 50.1). Three key factors served as the best independent
predictors of healing: PEDIS (perfusion, extent, depth,
infection, sensation) perfusion grade; the absence of
multiple foot ulcers; and shorter ulcer duration.

 extremity amputation, limb revascularization, and death) as
well as the time to the event. Using competing risk analysis
(with cumulative incidence functions) we estimated the
cumulative incidence of healing at 6 and 12 months. Because
either amputation or death would preclude further observa-
tion of healing of the index ulcer, for unhealed ulcers we
considered death and amputation to be competing risks;
thus, we provided healing estimates (with 95% CIs) and
cumulative incidence curves of the time to healing, in the
presence of competing risks. We censored participants who
were alive and without lower extremity amputation or
healing of their index ulcer at 12 months post-baseline or the
date of their case note review, if this took place before the
12-month follow-up.
Prognostic factors relating to healing
To explore the relationship of baseline factors with cumu-
lative incidence (rate) of healing, we used a proportional sub-
distribution hazards model [24] for competing risks data.
Using exploratory univariable analyses (single explanatory
variable), we first tested the association between each pre-
specified baseline prognostic factor (Table 1) separately with
incidence of healing. Then, we explored associations between
prognostic factors found to be significantly associated with
healing using the chi-squared test. We then entered all
prespecified factors in a preliminary multivariable (multiple
explanatory variables) analysis to examine their independent
effects on healing. Lastly, we entered factors that achieved
statistical significance at the 10% level into a final multivari-
able model. For all analyses, we present hazard ratios (HRs)
with 95% CIs and P values for prognostic factors we found
significantly associated with healing at the 5% level.
Missing data
We assumed that missing data for participants in the follow-
up population (e.g. date of healing, baseline covariates) were
missing at random and imputed these values using multiple
imputation [25]. Characteristics of participants with and
without missing data were compared to explore the pattern
of missing data. We performed separate imputation analyses
according to the participants’ healed status with an imputa-
tion model that included all factors considered in the
prognostic model, centre, and other outcomes of interest
(recurrence, revascularization, amputation and death). We
made a total of 10 imputations using the Markov chain
Monte Carlo method [26], and combined results using
Rubin’s rules [27].
Results
Consent and participant characteristics
We were able to include a total of 299 participants for the
12-month follow-up analyses in this study. Of these, inves-
tigators obtained consent from 250 participants (155 written
and 95 by telephone), and for 49 participants who had died
but had clinical data available. Figure 1 summarizes the
participant flow for this study. The main reason for exclusion
was no response to our request for consent (55/400 parti-
cipants, 14%). As shown in Table 2, baseline characteristics
were largely similar for those included and excluded;
however, participants included in the follow-up population
were slightly older (mean age 64 vs 59 years; P=0.001), had
more recurrent ulcers (30.4% vs 18.8%; P=0.0217), and had
more serious infections (65.2% vs 53.5% grade 3 or 4
infection; P=0.0352).
Missing data
There were minimal missing data for participants included in
the follow-up population. Date of healing was missing for 12
participants; 4% of all participants and 8.8% of healed
participants. There was no clear evidence, however, of a
pattern of missing data when comparing participants’ base-
line characteristics. There were also missing data for the
baseline covariates diabetes duration, extent of ulcer, ulcer
type and recurrent ulcer for two participants (0.7%), ulcer
duration for four participants (1.3%), antimicrobial dressing
and HbA1c for five participants (1.7%) and previous

 antibiotic regimen for 15 participants (5%). Given the low
level of missing data and the use of multiple imputation
based on all factors considered in the prognostic model to
mitigate against bias, missing data in the long-term follow-up
population are unlikely to have biased the statistical analysis.
12-month clinical outcomes
Table 3 summarizes the 12-month clinical outcomes, based
on whether or not the index ulcer healed. Healing of the
index ulcer at 12 months occurred in 136 participants
(45.5%). Among these, ulcer recurrence was reported within
the 12 months of follow-up in 13 participants (9.6%). A
substantial minority of participants underwent a surgical
procedure of the affected lower extremity, with 52 (17.4%)
having an amputation of some part of the foot and 18 (6.0%)
undergoing revascularization surgery, 10 (3.3%) of whom
underwent both revascularization surgery and amputation.
Furthermore, 45 participants (15.1%) had died within the 12
month follow-up period.
Time to healing and other clinical outcomes
For participants whose index ulcer healed, the median
(range) time to healing was 4.5 (0.5–12.9) months (n=136,
missing n=12). Adverse events generally occurred relatively
early in the clinical course of treatment. For those with a
recurrence of the index ulcer, the median (range) time of
recurrence was 1.7 (0.3–10.7) months post-healing. For
those who underwent revascularization surgery, the median
(range) time to surgery was 3.0 (0.1–9.5) months. For those
who underwent a lower extremity amputation, the median
(range) time to amputation was 2.0 (0.0–10.6) months.
Finally, for those who died during the 12-month follow-up,
the median (range) time to death was 5.6 (0.6–11.5) months.
The estimated incidence of healing, accounting for com-
peting events of amputation or death, was 27.5% (95% CI
22.4, 32.5) at 6 months and 44.5% (95% CI 38.9, 50.1) at
12 months. Figure 2 shows the estimated cumulative inci-
dence curves of the time to healing and the competing risks of
death and amputation.

HRs (95% CI) and P values for baseline factors identified by

Prognosis of infected diabetic foot ulcer � M. Ndosi et al.
 Univariable analyses showed that 11 of the prespecified
factors were potentially associated (based on a P value <0.1)
with the incidence of healing of the index ulcer. The
incidence of healing was higher if there was only one ulcer
(rather than multiple) on the index foot, or if coagulase-
negative staphylococci were identified from a culture of the
ulcer. The incidence of healing was lower if the index ulcer:
(i) had a PEDIS perfusion grade of ≥2; (ii) was classified as
ischaemic; (iii) had been present for ~2 months or longer
prior to CODIFI enrolment; (iv) had a Wagner grade of ≥2;
(v) had a PEDIS depth grade of ≥2; (vi) had a PEDIS infection
grade of ≥3; (vii) was covered with an antimicrobial dressing
at baseline; or (viii) had methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) identified from the ulcer culture (Table 4).
When fitting all potential prognostic factors into a multi-
variable proportional sub-distribution hazards model (a
preliminary analysis), then into a final analysis model, only
four remained statistically significantly associated with the
incidence of healing (excluding age; Table 4). The incidence
of healing was higher if: (i) there was only one ulcer on the
index foot (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.18 to 3.06); or (ii) coagulase-
negative staphylococci was identified from the ulcer culture
(HR 1.53, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.40). The incidence of healing
was lower if the index ulcer: (i) had a PEDIS perfusion grade
of ≥2; (HR 0.37, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.55) or (ii) had been
present for ~2 months or longer prior to CODIFI enrolment
(HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.39 to 0.77).
Associations between factors
Table 5 summarizes pairwise associations between factors
related to the incidence of healing. Several factors that were
statistically significantly associated with healing in the
univariable analysis were no longer statistically significant
in the multivariable analysis (ulcer type, PEDIS depth, PEDIS
infection, Wagner grade, antimicrobial dressing at baseline,
and MRSA isolation).
Pairwise associations between various factors that met
statistical significance (P<0.05; cross-tabulations quantifying
these associations are presented in Table S1) included ulcer
type, and PEDIS perfusion, PEDIS depth, PEDIS infection
and Wagner grades. Among these, only PEDIS perfusion
grade remained statistically significant in the multivariable
analysis, with a higher grade associated with ischaemic
ulcers, greater depth, more severe infection and higher
Wagner grades. Ischaemic ulcers were also associated with
having multiple ulcers on the index foot, a longer-duration
ulcer, and a lower rate of isolation of coagulase-negative
staphylococci from the ulcer culture, all of which were
statistically significant in the multivariable analysis. The
presence of an antimicrobial dressing on the ulcer at baseline
did not remain statistically significant in the multivariable

the index foot, either present at baseline or developed subse-
quently. For 10 participants amputation occurred prior to
healing of the index ulcer with the amputation being on the
index foot but of a different site to that of the index ulcer due to
another non-index ulcer on the index foot, either present at
baseline or developed subsequently.

 analysis, but was associated with a higher perfusion grade
and a longer ulcer duration. Isolation of MRSA from the
ulcer culture was associated with ulcer type, and was more
frequently reported from cultures of ischaemic ulcers. Inter-
estingly, isolation on ulcer culture of MRSA was inversely
associated with isolation of coagulase-negative staphylo-
cocci, each being only reported in the absence of the other.
Discussion
In this large, prospective study with 12 months’ follow-up,
we found that three key factors served as the best indepen-
dent predictors of healing of an infected diabetic foot ulcer:
the PEDIS perfusion grade; the absence of multiple foot
ulcers; and a shorter ulcer duration. A lower perfusion grade
suggests the presence of peripheral arterial disease, which
previous studies have shown to be an important predictor of
poor outcomes (i.e. lack of healing and lower extremity
amputation) in people with a diabetic foot ulcer [5,13–15].
In the present study, among the five PEDIS domains,
perfusion (indicating peripheral arterial disease) was shown
to be the only independent predictor of healing. Ulcer
duration and presence of multiple ulcers have also been
reported as significant predictors for non-healing in other
studies [28,29].
The participants in the present study with a clinically
suspected diabetic foot ulcer infection had poorer outcomes
than reported in previously published studies, which enrolled
people with various types of diabetic foot ulcers [5,13–15].
We found a 12-month incidence of healing of 44.5%, while
Prompers et al. [5], Ince et al. [13] and Jeffcoate et al. [14]
reported healing rates at 12 months of 77% and 68.3%,
respectively. In addition, we found that during 12 months of
follow-up for their infected diabetic foot ulcer, 17.4% of our
participants underwent at least partial lower extremity
amputation and 15.1% died, compared with 22% for
amputation and 6% deaths in the study by Prompers et al.
[5] and 5.9% for amputation or death (reported as com-
bined) in the study by Ince et al. [13] These differences may
have arisen because we specifically recruited people with a
suspected infected diabetic foot ulcer, whereas Prompers
et al. [5] included only people presenting with a new foot
ulcer and excluded those treated at the participating centres
for an ulcer on the ipsilateral foot during the previous 12

compared with our participants, we would expect their
population to have had a better prognosis from the outset.
Ince et al. [13] recruited participants from a heterogeneous
clinic population. They also used conventional survival
analyses to estimate healing rates, which neither accounted
nor adjusted for the competing events of amputation or
death; this probably overestimates the incidence of healing.

 incidence of healing. This is a group of relatively avirulent
organisms, and the fact that their presence was inversely
related to the presence of the more virulent MRSA may
explain the association with healing. There were no statis-
tically significant associations between ulcer healing and any
other ulcer culture results, including whether or not the
microbiology laboratory reported growth of any microor-
ganisms. Unlike other studies, we found no significant
association between the incidence of healing and prognostic
factors such as glycaemic control [30], duration of diabetes
[5,13], ulcer site, sex [15], wound area or wound depth [28].
Noteworthy is that poor arterial perfusion often leads to
‘punched out’ ulcers that are likely to be deeper than non-
ischaemic ulcers [23]. Our analyses suggest that it is the poor
perfusion (peripheral arterial disease) rather than the depth
of the ulcer that leads to impaired healing.
We also found a higher incidence of ulcer healing among
older participants, but this finding was not consistently
supported when we explored age categorically at various
‘splits’ in the data. As there is no apparent biological basis for
this finding or support from results of other studies [31], we
think it is likely to be spurious.
To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of
people with infected diabetic foot ulcers to estimate method-
ically the cumulative incidence of healing, to report the time
to healing, and to identify factors associated with the
incidence of healing while adjusting for competing risks.
Taking these factors into consideration, we found that
conventional survival analysis would have overestimated
the incidence of healing in the present study by almost 10%.
As this study recruited participants from 25 centres across
England, ranging from large teaching hospitals to small
primary healthcare centres, these results are likely to be
generalizable to outcomes of diabetic foot ulcers across
England, and perhaps in other higher-income countries. This
is also the first large study of outcomes of diabetic foot ulcers
conducted since publication of the 2011 UK National Institute
for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on man-
agement of diabetic foot problems [17], which have been
updated by new guidelines [19]. The poor outcomes we found
in the present study may suggest that either the guideline
recommendations have not been widely implemented or they
are not very effective. The current NICE guidelines [19]
recommend placing systems across all care settings designed
to prevent and manage diabetic foot problems; however, a
recent UK national audit [32] found that the implementation
of the NICE guidelines was not universal.
Diagnosing whether or not a diabetic foot ulcer is infected
can be difficult, especially in the presence of peripheral
neuropathy or limb ischaemia, but authorities generally agree
that it should be based on finding signs or symptoms of
inflammation, purulence and possibly other ‘secondary’ clinical
findings [16,18]. Of the participants enrolled in the main
CODIFI study [21], 12% had a swab or tissue sample growing
no pathogens isolated, but almost half were receiving antibiotic
therapy and two-thirds were using an antimicrobial dressing.
Furthermore, deficiencies in specimen collection, transport or
processing may have led to false-negative cultures.
The present study has three key limitations. First, our 12-
month case note review was an extension to the original

 CODIFI study [21], resulting in incomplete follow-up for
those who could not be re-contacted, did not re-consent for
the study extension or where case notes were unavailable,
leading to 25% of participants lost to follow-up. We did not
include participants lost to follow-up because of the assump-
tions required in order to impute data for multiple outcomes
(healing, amputation, death), and the timing of these
outcomes. The characteristics of participants included and
participants not included were largely similar, but partici-
pants included were slightly older, with more recurrent ulcers
and more severe infections.
Second, as we did not require retrospective consent for
case note review of participants who had died prior to our
ethics amendment for this study, attrition bias may have
contributed to the slightly older age, more severe infection
and the overall inflated death rate. Among the 377 partic-
ipants for whom we had follow-up data and known survival
status at the point of consent, 56 (14.9%) had died. As this
includes deaths outside of the 12-month follow-up period,
we believe the minimum death rate within the 12-month
follow-up period was 13% (49/377) and the maximum
16.4% (49/299).
Third, we do not have 12-month data on whether or not
infection
resolved.
Although
resolution
of
infection
is
important for ulcer healing, our study design focused on
healing, and the consequences of non-healing. Our case note
review included data on antibiotics prescribed to participants
prior to baseline sampling and immediately after sampling.
This allowed us to assess the relationship between the
various outcomes of interest and the pathogens isolated from
the diabetic foot ulcer, as well as the antibiotic regimens
prescribed. We think it would be useful if a future prospec-
tive study explored the relationship between healing of an
infected ulcer and the appropriateness of anti-infective
therapy, determined by whether the antibiotic therapy was
active against the isolated organisms.
In conclusion, the present study has confirmed that people
with a clinically infected diabetic foot ulcer have a poor
prognosis. Our results also confirmed that the presence of
limb ischaemia, multiple foot ulcers and a longer ulcer
duration were most predictive of poor 12-month outcomes.
These findings should be useful to clinicians in various care
settings to help identify people most at risk of poor outcomes
who may need prioritization for increased interventions or
referral to specialist centres. Our findings on prognostic
factors or diabetic foot ulcer healing should also be useful to
inform the design and analysis of future clinical studies.
