New class of precision antimicrobials redefines role of
Clostridium difficile S-layer in virulence and viability

There is a medical need for antibacterial agents that do not damage the resident gut microbiota or promote the spread
of antibiotic resistance. We recently described a prototypic precision bactericidal agent, Av-CD291.2, which selectively
kills specific Clostridium difficile strains and prevents them from colonizing mice. We have since selected two Av-
CD291.2–resistant mutants that have a surface (S)-layer–null phenotype due to distinct point mutations in the slpA
gene. Using newly identified bacteriophage receptor binding proteins for targeting, we constructed a panel of Avidocin-
CDs that kills diverse C. difficile isolates in an S-layer sequence-dependent manner. In addition to bacteriophage receptor
recognition, characterization of the mutants also uncovered important roles for S-layer protein A (SlpA) in sporulation,
resistance to innate immunity effectors, and toxin production. Surprisingly, S-layer–null mutants were found to persist in
the hamster gut despite a complete attenuation of virulence. These findings suggest antimicrobials targeting virulence
factors dispensable for fitness in the host force pathogens to trade virulence for viability and would have clear clinical
advantages should resistance emerge. Given their exquisite specificity for the pathogen, Avidocin-CDs have substantial
therapeutic potential for the treatment and prevention of C. difficile infections.
INTRODUCTION
New antibacterial agents are needed to counteract the impending loss of
effective treatment options for multidrug-resistant bacteria. Furthering
this need is the realization that dysbiosis caused by broad-spectrum an-
tibiotic use contributes to the prevalence of diseases/disorders such as
inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and gastrointestinal infections (1).
Strategies to overcome these threats include use of narrow-spectrum or
precision agents and the design of drugs that target virulence instead of
in vitro viability (2, 3). One pathogen for which alternative treatment ap-
proaches are needed is Clostridium difficile. This spore-forming, obligate
anaerobe is the leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. About
450,000 cases and 29,000 deaths each year are attributed to this pathogen
in the United Statesalone (4). Asaresult, the Centersfor Disease Control
and Prevention has identified C. difficile as an urgent threat to human
health (5). This opportunistic pathogen exploits a reduction in gut mi-
crobiota diversity that often follows broad-spectrum antibiotic use to
proliferate, release toxins, and cause life-threatening colitis (6). Although
the toxins have been studied in great detail, other aspects of C. difficile
virulence, including colonization of the gut, are not well understood (6).
The C. difficile cell surface is covered by a paracrystalline surface (S)–
layer largely composed of S-layer protein A (SlpA) and sparsely in-
terspersed by 28 related cell wall proteins (7). The S-layer precursor
SlpA is proteolytically processed on the cell surface to generate the low–
molecular weight (LMW) and high–molecular weight (HMW) S-layer
proteins (SLPs). The SLPs interact with high affinity to form a hetero-
dimer, the basic unit of the mature S-layer (8). The slpA gene is located
within a highly variable S-layer cassette consisting of five genes; 13 dis-
tinct S-layer cassette types (SLCTs) have been described to date (9). The
variation that defines individual cassette types is largely confined to the
LMW SLP-encoding region of slpA (4). The HMW SLP region is highly
conserved and includes the cell wall binding motifs that anchor the S-
layer to the cell wall (10). The S-layer and several associated cell wall pro-
teins have been implicated in colonization of host tissues (7) and in stim-
ulation of the host immune response via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)
signaling (11).
Although C. difficile is not significantly resistant to the frontline anti-
biotics used to treat C. difficile infections (CDIs) (vancomycin, metro-
nidazole, and fidaxomicin), the use of these antibiotics causes further
disruption of the resident microbiota leading to frequent CDI relapse
(6). To be safe and effective, new agents to treat and prevent CDIs must
not harm the diverse gut microbiota and the colonization resistance it
provides. Avidocin-CDs represent one such potential agent (12). These
bactericidal proteins are genetically modified versions of natural R-type
bacteriocins (also known as diffocins) produced by C. difficile to kill
competing C. difficile strains (13). Diffocins resemble Myoviridae phage
tails and consist of a contractile sheath, nanotube core, baseplate, and
tail fiber structures. However, instead of delivering DNA across the bac-
terial membrane as does a bacteriophage, R-type bacteriocins function
as killing machines by injecting a nanotube core through the bacterial cell
envelope and creating a small pore that dissipates the cell’s membrane
potential (14). Killing specificity is determined by the receptor-binding
proteins (RBPs) located at the tailfiber tips that trigger sheath contraction
uponbindingwithacognatereceptoronthebacterialcellsurface.Genetic
replacement or fusion of the RBP gene with homologs from other strains
or RBP sources (such as C. difficile bacteriophages and prophage in-
sertions) makes it possible to retarget killing (12, 15–17). These modified
bacteriocins are known as Avidocin-CDs. An Avidocin-CD prototype,
Av-CD291.2, constructed with a bacteriophage RBP identified within a
prophage insertion, was found to be more stable than the natural parent
diffocin. Av-CD291.2 had a modified killing spectrum that included
all hypervirulent ribotype 027 (RT027) C. difficile strains tested, blocked
C. difficile colonization in a mouse model of spore transmission, and did
not disrupt the resident gutmicrobiota(12). These propertiesencourage
the further development of Avidocin-CDs as oral human therapeutics.
Here, we further characterize the Av-CD291.2 mechanism of action
and describe an expanded panel of Avidocin-CDs that cover all clini-
cally relevant C. difficile strain types using newly identified bacterio-
phage RBPs. Analysis of rare Av-CD291.2–resistant mutants enabled

 the identification of SlpA as the cell surface receptor for all tested
Avidocin-CDs and, by extension, the corresponding bacteriophage
RBP sources. Unsuspected roles for SlpA in multiple C. difficile processes
were also identified. Despite defects that include the complete attenua-
tion of virulence, S-layer mutants remarkably were observed to colonize
and persist in the hamster gut for the duration of a 14-day study.
RESULTS
Av-CD291.2–resistant mutants lack an S-layer
Resistance to any antimicrobial agent can occur and be exploited to
understand its mode of action. We isolated two spontaneous mutants of
C. difficile strain R20291 (RT027), FM2.5 and FM2.6, that were resistant
to killing by Av-CD291.2. These mutants appeared at a frequency of
<1 × 10−9 and were found to encode independent point mutations in
the slpA gene (Fig. 1A). Both mutations were predicted to truncate SlpA
at a site N-terminal to the posttranslational cleavage site and thereby
prevent formation of an S-layer. Both FM2.5 and FM2.6 lacked detect-
able cell surface SLP subunits as predicted but still expressed minor cell
wall proteins including Cwp2 and Cwp6 (Fig. 1B). These mutations did
not affect the growth rate of the bacteria in vitro (fig. S1); however,
FM2.5 displayed a slight, but statistically significant earlier entry into
the stationary phase [maximum OD600nm (optical density at 600 nm):
FM2.5 = 2.2; R20291 = 3.2; P = 0.000012]. We attempted to complement
the FM2.5 and FM2.6 mutations with a plasmid-borne wild-type R20291
slpA; however, unexpected homologousrecombination restored the wild-
type slpA gene to the chromosome (fig. S2). Accordingly, we created
genetically identifiable recombinants “watermarked” with synonymous
substitutions in the R20291 slpA allele (Fig. 1A). The resulting strains,
FM2.5RW and FM2.6RW, were found to have LMW and HMW SLPs
on their surface (Fig. 1B) and regained sensitivity to Av-CD291.2 (Fig. 1,
C and D). These results confirmed that an intact S-layer is required for
Av-CD291.2 killing but did not determine whether SlpA itself or a pro-
tein dependent on the S-layer for surface localization was the receptor
for Av-CD291.2. To address this question, slpA alleles from the most
common non-R20291 SLCTs were individually cloned into an inducible
expression plasmid and transferred into the S-layer–deficient FM2.5
(Fig. 1E). Each resulting strain expressed the expected LMW and HMW
SLPs on the cell surface, indicative of S-layer formation (9), but did not
regain sensitivity to Av-CD291.2, thus ruling out the possibility that the
simple formation of an S-layer was responsible for sensitivity to Av-
CD291.2. To address whether Av-CD291.2 directly interacts with
SLCT-4 SlpA, plasmids encoding SlpA from eight different SLCTs
were introduced into the non-isogenic laboratory strain 630 (SLCT-7;
RT012), which is insensitive to Av-CD291.2. In this fully S-layer–
competent SLCT-7 wild-type strain, only induction of SLCT-4 SlpA
was sufficient to confer sensitivity to Av-CD291.2 (fig. S3). Moreover,
the degree of sensitivity was dependent on the level of induction, with
only 10 ng/ml of inducer required (fig. S3A). Together, these observa-
tions clearly demonstrate that the SLCT-4 variant of SlpA is the cell sur-
face target of Av-CD291.2.
Sensitivity to Avidocin-CDs is slpA allele–specific
These observations suggested that each variant of SlpA may serve as a
specific receptor for additional C. difficile bacteriophage RBPs. In an
attempt to expand Avidocin-CD coverage beyond SLCT-4, we con-
structed 10 new Avidocin-CDs using predicted bacteriophage RBPs
mined from the genome sequences of C. difficile clinical isolates or new-
ly isolated bacteriophages (table S1). Source strains for RBP sequences
were chosen on the basis of their SLCTs because strain typing informa-
tion for the RBP source often correlates with sensitivity to the corre-
sponding Avidocin (for example, RT027 and sensitivity to Av-CD291.2
and SLCT-1 of the phi-147 propagating strain and sensitivity to Av-
CD147.1) (12, 15, 16). Preparations of Diffocin-4 (scaffold for all
Avidocin-CDs), Av-CD291.2, and each of the new Avidocin-CDs
were tested for killing activity on a panel of 62 C. difficile isolates
containing all 12 known SLCTs, hybrid 2/6 SLCT, and a newly iden-
tified 14th SLCT (fig. S4). Each new Avidocin-CD had a broader
killing spectrum than the host range of the parental bacteriophage
from which the RBP was derived (figs. S4 and S5), perhaps due to
circumvention of bacteriophage resistance systems. Only two strains,
representing SLCT-3 and SLCT-5, were not killed by a single Avidocin-
CD (fig. S4); otherwise, every isolate from all 12 other SLCTs was killed
by at least one Avidocin-CD. A near-perfect correlation was observed
between a strain’s SLCT and its sensitivity to each of the Avidocin-
CDs. The only exceptions were SLCT-2 isolates with Av-CD027.2
and Av-CD685.1. A strong correlation was also observed between ri-
botype and sensitivity to a particular Avidocin-CD because all ribotypes
in the panel, except RT012, RT014, and RT015, were found to associate
exclusively with a single SLCT. A significant degree of sequence varia-
bility was tolerated within an SLCT by some Avidocin-CDs. For exam-
ple, both Av-CD684.1 and Av-CD685.1 kill every SLCT-7 strain tested
despite sequence identities between SLCT-7 SlpAs as low as 81% (figs.
S4 and S6). Similar correlations with strain sensitivity and SLCT or ri-
botype were not observed for killing with Diffocin-4, suggesting that this
natural R-type bacteriocin binds to C. difficile via another receptor.
Having made these observations, we wanted to determine whether
sensitivity to specific Avidocin-CDs was directly dependent on the var-
iant of SlpA present. The panel of isogenic FM2.5 strains complemented
with slpA alleles from the 11 most common SLCTs was tested for sen-
sitivity to a panel of the most potent Avidocin-CDs (Fig. 2). The corre-
sponding parental strains from which the slpA alleles were obtained
were used as controls. Each complemented strain became sensitive to
the same Avidocin-CDs as the parental strain. To confirm that this en-
gineered sensitivity did not result from altered cell surface architecture,
we performed an analogous experiment in a second panel of isogenic
strains created when plasmids encoding SlpAs from eight SLCTs were
introduced into the S-layer–competent strain 630 (fig. S3, B and C). As
before, the spectrum of killing was identical to that of the parental strains
from which the slpA alleles were obtained. These data demonstrate that
the polymorphic SlpA acts as the binding receptor for each of the
Avidocin-CDs tested and therefore the corresponding bacteriophage
RBPs.
S-layer–null mutants are abnormally sensitive to innate
immune effectors and display severe sporulation defects
Bacterial S-layers serve many critical cellular functions (7). Given its
location on the cell surface, the S-layer has been proposed to act as a
molecular sieve to selectively limit exposure of the underlying cell
envelope to large biomolecules such as the innate immune effector
lysozyme (18). Until now, analysis of C. difficile S-layer function has
been hampered by an inability to isolate slpA-deficient mutants (19).
Whereas C. difficile is highly resistant to killing by lysozyme, resistance
has been attributed to extensive peptidoglycan deacetylation (20). To
determine whether the S-layer also plays a role in lysozyme resistance,
we treated exponentially growing bacteria with a high concentration of
lysozyme (500 mg/ml) and monitored the effects on growth (Fig. 3A).
Upon addition of lysozyme, an immediate decrease in optical density

 consistent with cell lysis, followed by slower growth, was observed for
the S-layermutant FM2.5.In contrast, R20291 and FM2.5RW displayed
only a transient decrease in growth rate, consistent with natural resistance.
Having confirmed a role for the S-layer in lysozyme resistance, we
then tested for resistance to the human cathelicidin antimicrobial pep-
tide LL-37 to determine whether S-layer–mediated resistance extended
to other innate immune effectors (Fig. 3B). LL-37 is found at mucosal
surfaces at concentrations of up to 5 mg/ml under normal conditions,
with further expression induced in response to infection (21). Treat-
ment with LL-37 (5 mg/ml) completely killed exponentially growing
cultures of the S-layer mutant FM2.5; the same treatment caused only
a slight reduction in growth rates for R20291 and FM2.5RW. Together,
these data demonstrate a role for the S-layer in resistance to both lyso-
zyme and LL-37.
In addition to sensitivity to lysozyme and LL-37, it was noted that
the S-layer mutant strains survived poorly in the standard charcoal
medium used to transport C. difficile strains. The ability of C. difficile
to survive in the environment and be transmitted to new hosts is reliant
on the bacterium’s ability to produce a heat- and chemical-resistant
spore (22). We analyzed sporulation efficiency by measuring the
numbers of heat-resistant spores as a percentage of total viable colony-
forming units (CFUs) over 5 days (fig. S7A). Spore production by wild-
type R20291 and FM2.5RW cultures was reproducible and equivalent
and represented 73 and 85% of total viable counts on day 5, respec-
tively (Fig. 3C). In contrast, spore production by FM2.5 was significantly
lower (P ≤ 0.00001). Spores only represented 4.3% of total viable counts
on day 5, which is a 17- to 20-fold reduction compared to R20291 and
FM2.5RW. These observed differences in FM2.5 spore formation were
not due to an inability to germinate efficiently (Fig. 3D). When the bile
salt germinant taurocholate was added to purified spore preparations,
the speed and efficiency of germination initiation for FM2.5 spores were
indistinguishable from that of R20291 and FM2.5RW. Analysis of bac-
terial cultures by phase-contrast microscopy also pointed to a reduction
in sporulation efficiency (fig. S7, B and C), as 5.2-fold fewer phase-bright
spores were observed in cultures of FM2.5 (FM2.5, 8.7% versus R20291,
44.9%; FM2.5RW, 45.4%). We noted a discrepancy between the mag-
nitudes of the sporulation defect determined microscopically (5.2-fold
less than R20291) compared with direct counting of viable spore CFUs
(20-fold less than R20291). This suggests that many of the microscop-
ically counted spores were non-viable after the 65°C heat treatment
required to differentiate spores from vegetative cell CFUs. To test the
FM2.5 spores for possible stress resistance defects, we exposed the
cultures to a harsher heat treatment (75°C for 30 min). The 75°C heat
treatment further reduced FM2.5 spore viability by 33-fold compared
with the standard 65°C (Fig. 3C). The same treatment only reduced
spore viability by 1.5-fold for R20291 and 2-fold for FM2.5RW. Collect-
ively, these data indicate that the production and quality of the infectious
spores are severely impaired by the loss of the S-layer.

 Transmission electron microscopy was used to identify potential
morphological changes associated with these defects (fig. S8). In FM2.5
cultures, we observed spores with disorganized material loosely attached
to the electron-dense core that lacked discernible, well-organized protein
coat layers (fig. S8A) (23). To determine whether these unusual spore
morphologies were responsible for the observed thermal sensitivity, we
repeated these analyses with spores purified on a Histodenz gradient. After
purification, spores of FM2.5 were morphologically indistinguishable
from those of R20291 and FM2.5RW (fig. S8C). Surprisingly, purified
FM2.5 spores still displayed increased thermal sensitivity. A 75°C heat
treatment reduced FM2.5 spore viability by 37.1-fold compared to 10-
and 18.1-fold for R20291 and FM2.5RW, respectively (fig. S8B). Several
distinct biochemical and structural features of the spore, including the
concentric cortex peptidoglycan and protein layers and core dehydra-
tion, have been independently linked to heat resistance (24–26). Minor
defects in any of these features could explain the observed thermal sen-
sitivity of FM2.5 spores.
S-layer–null mutants are completely avirulent despite
persistent gut colonization
We tested the ability of the S-layer mutant FM2.5 to cause disease in the
Golden Syrian hamster model of acute CDI. As expected, all animals
inoculated with FM2.5RW behaved similarly to those inoculated with
the wild-type R20291 strain and succumbed to CDI within 102 hours
of infection, with mean times to cull for R20291 and FM2.5RW of
67 hours 36 min and 57 hours 19 min, respectively (P = 0.52; Fig. 4A).
Both groups of hamsters showed typical signs of disease including
wet tail and drop in body temperature at experimental end point.
In contrast, all animals inoculated with FM2.5 displayed no signs
of disease and survived for the duration of the 14-day study (P =
0.0018; FM2.5 versus R20291; Fig. 4A). Surprisingly, the lack of vir-
ulence was not due to a colonization defect. FM2.5 was capable of
persistent colonization; CFUs in the cecum and colon at the end of
study (14 days) were not statistically different from those observed
for R20291 and FM2.5RW in the same tissues taken at experimental
end point some 10 days earlier (Fig. 4B). Toxin measurements from gut
contents 14 days after inoculation with FM2.5 showed marked reduc-
tions in both toxin A and B activity compared to samples taken from
hamsters that succumbed to infection with either R20291 or FM2.5RW
(Fig. 4, C and D).
S-layer–null mutants produce less toxin in vitro and
Avidocin-CD killing does not result in toxin release
Given the avirulence and low toxin activity observed in animals, we
assayed the FM2.5 and control strains for toxin production in vitro
(Fig. 5A). Toxin B was used as an indicator for both toxins because they
are coordinately expressed and released (6). As expected, both R20291
and FM2.5RW produced toxin upon entry into the stationary phase. A
small amount of toxin B was detected intracellularly at 24 hours; there-
after, toxin B was exclusively detected in the culture supernatant.

 Cultures of FM2.5 produced less toxin B at all time points, consistent
with in vivo observations.
For toxin-producing pathogens, antimicrobials that lyse bacteria or
increase toxin production can exacerbate disease severity and lessen the
effectiveness of the treatment by inadvertently releasing toxins (27). We
examined culture supernatants of strain R20291 after treatment with
Avidocin-CDs for the presence of extracellular toxin B to determine
whether killing by an Avidocin-CD could result in unwanted toxin re-
lease (Fig. 5B). Despite effective killing, intracellular toxin B remained
constant with no detectable release observed in the culture supernatants
(Fig. 5C) at any concentration, including samples that exhibited total
killing of all vegetative bacterial cells due to a large excess of Avidocin-
CD. These results confirm that Avidocin-CDs are bactericidal but nei-
ther lyse the target cell nor release harmful intracellular stores of toxin B.
DISCUSSION
The bactericidal properties of Avidocin-CDs bode well for the clinical
application of this new class of antimicrobial agents for combating CDI.
Previous studies demonstrated that killing by the prototypic Avidocin-
CD, Av-CD291.2, was highly specific for BI/NAP1/RT027-type strains
and did not detectably alter the resident gut microbiota in mice (12). For
production purposes, fermentation of genetically modified Bacillus sub-
tilis expressing these agents is similar to many established industrial pro-
cesses and scalable to thousands of liters. We selected, isolated, and
characterized rare C. difficile mutants resistant to Av-CD291.2 to better
understand its mechanism of action. In the process, we discovered the
Avidocin-CD–binding receptor, the C. difficile S-layer. Our 10 new
Avidocin-CDs were all found to target variants of SlpA associated
with different SLCTs. Given that the great majority of the sequence
variation in SlpA is found within the surface-exposed LMW subunit
(9), this relationship between SLCT and Avidocin-CD sensitivity
strongly suggests that the LMW SLP is the binding site for all the
studied Avidocin-CDs. Further, it indirectly identifies this portion of
the SlpA as the binding receptor for many C. difficile myophages be-
cause each Avidocin-CD is constructed with a different bacteriophage-
derivedRBP.Thesefindingshelpexplainthelimitedhostrangesobserved
for many C. difficile myophages (28, 29). It also suggests that antigenic
variation observed between SLCTs may not be due to immune escape
as previously proposed (9) but rather due to a molecular arm race be-
tween bacteria and bacteriophages. C. difficile is under selective pressure
to change the bacteriophage receptor, which, in turn, puts selective pres-
sure on the bacteriophages to evolve new RBPs.
Patternsofstrain sensitivityto eachAvidocin-CDindicate thatkilling
was much broader than the parental bacteriophage’s host range. A
possible explanation for this observation is that a typical bacteriophage

 infection cycle is a seven-step process: attachment, genome injection,
replication, transcription, translation, assembly, and lysis. Bacteria can
become resistant to a bacteriophage by blocking any stage of the infec-
tion cycle, for example, CRISPR-Cas or restriction-modification systems
that prevent phage DNA from replicating (30). In contrast, Avidocin-
CD killing is a two-step process: attachment to the target bacterium
followed by killing via creation of a small pore that dissipates the target
bacterium’s membrane potential. As observed with other Avidocins and
R-type bacteriocins (16, 31), selected Avidocin-CD–resistant mu-
tants survived because of mutations that caused the loss or modifica-
tion of the SlpA-binding receptor and not because of mutations that
directly disrupted the killing mechanism, such as improper pore forma-
tion, or caused proteolytic cleavage of the agent. The bias toward recep-
tor mutations suggests that the Avidocin-CD killing mechanism is
simple and robust.
Modification of the binding receptor to avoid Avidocin-CD killing
through either missense mutations or S-layer switching, as evidenced by
the random association between clades and SLCTs (9), could also the-
oretically lead to resistance. Although sequence variations between slpA
alleles within each SLCT indicate that missense mutations do occur
(9), our findings suggest that resistance due to this type of modifica-
tion is unlikely because the bacteriophage RBPs used to construct the
Avidocin-CDs have already evolved to counter this mode of potential
escape. A high degree of sequence variation is observed in SlpA within
SLCTs; for example, the SlpAs of SLCT-7 strains 630 and M68 display
only 81% amino acid identity. Despite this variation, both strains are
efficiently killed by both Av-CD684.1 and Av-CD685.1. As for the
emergence of resistance via horizontal transfer of the S-layer cassette,
the administration of a cocktail of Avidocin-CDs that kill all the
common SLCTs would make successful resistance via S-layer switching
extremely unlikely. It appears that the only likely means of resistance
to all the Avidocin-CDs is through complete loss of SlpA, as observed
for resistance to Av-CD291.2. As a consequence, the observed phe-
notypes for FM2.5 are germane to all likely Avidocin-CD–resistant
mutants.
For a precision medicine agent to be successful, knowing the molec-
ular target (in this case, the binding receptor) is vital in designing accu-
rate diagnostics to guide treatment decisions. If Avidocin-CDs were to
be administered individually, a diagnostic determining SLCT of infect-
ing C. difficile would be highly accurate for informing Avidocin-CD
treatment decisions. However, an increase in the prevalence of hybrid
cassettes, as found in RT078 strains (9), would decrease the accuracy
for this typing method. Strain ribotyping could also be used to avoid de-
velopment of new diagnostics, but predicting sensitivity to a particular
Avidocin-CD may be challenging because ribotypes are not consistently
linked to a single SLCT (that is, RT012, RT014, and RT015, as noted
above). SlpA typing would provide the most accurate diagnostic
and prove more illuminating than ribotyping because SlpA is directly
related to the physiology of C. difficile, whereas ribotyping detects phys-
iologically inconsequential ribosomal RNA gene polymorphisms. It may

indicated ratio of agent to cells or Av-CD684.1, which does not kill strain R20291, at a 500:1 ratio (IS), or left untreated (UT). After treatment, viable bacteria were enumerated (bar

determined after heat treatment at 65°C for 30 min to kill vegetative cells (HT). (C) After Avidocin-CD treatment, released toxin B in culture supernatants (ExC) was detected by
Western immunoblot using an anti–toxin B monoclonal antibody. As a positive control for toxin release, R20291 was treated with the phiCD27L bacteriophage endolysin (41). The
amount of remaining intracellular toxin B (IntC) was determined by lysing cells with CD27L endolysin and detection by Western immunoblot as before. A fresh sample of untreated
R20291 was lysed with CD27L endolysin to show normal intracellular toxin quantities (EL). The original uncropped images for each Western immunoblot can be found in fig. S9.

 also be possible to administer a cocktail of five to six Avidocin-CDs that
target 12 of the 14 C. difficile SLCTs. If such a cocktail of Avidocin-CDs
were to be administered, a point-of-care diagnostic would only need to
detect the presence of C. difficile to guide treatment decisions.
The strong selective pressure afforded by Av-CD291.2 allowed iso-
lation of spontaneous C. difficile S-layer–null mutants. In addition to
enabling identification of the Avidocin-CD cell surface receptor, these
mutants also provide an unprecedented opportunity to study S-layer
function (fig. S10). Given the ubiquity of S-layers in both Bacteria and
Archaea, including many pathogenic species, surprisingly little is known
about their function. It has been suggested that the S-layer could act as
a molecular sieve to exclude certain large biomolecules from the cell
envelope (18); however, this has not been confirmed in live cells. We
have demonstrated that an intact S-layer is required for resistance to
two components of the innate immune system: lysozyme and the anti-
microbial peptide LL-37. Assembled S-layers are highly symmetrical with
regular repeating pores. The size of the pores in the C. difficile S-layer
is not yet known, but in other species, pore sizes of between 2 and 6 nm
have been reported (7). A pore size of 2 nm could conceivably exclude
the16-kDa globular protein lysozyme, but a small peptide such as LL-37
would experience no such steric hindrance. It is possible that charged
surfaces on the assembled S-layer serve to sequester the cationic peptide
away from the cell envelope in a manner analogous to capsular polysac-
charides (32). Our data have identified other pleiotropic functions for
the C. difficile S-layer (fig. S10). It is clear that the S-layer is the cell sur-
face receptor for all of the Avidocin-CDs described here and, by extension,
the receptor for the bacteriophages from which the RBP-encoding genes
were cloned. Although a Bacillus bacteriophage has been found to bind
SLP Sap (33), this is the first time a receptor for a C. difficile bacteriophage
has been identified. Furthermore, our data imply that S-layer recognition
is a common feature of bacteriophages that infect this species.
Surprisingly, the S-layer mutant also displayed severe sporulation
defects, with fewer and morphologically defective spores produced. De-
spite a number of well-studied spore-forming organisms producing S-
layers, including Bacillus anthracis (33), S-layer biogenesis has not been
reported previously to affect sporulation. There is currently no evidence
to suggest that the SLPs are a structural part of the mature spore, and the
mechanismsby whichthe S-layercan influence sporulation are currently
unknown. However, this observation has serious ramifications for the
ability of an Avidocin-CD–resistant, S-layer–defective mutant to survive
and be transmitted to other hosts. The spore is an absolute requirement
forC.difficile survivalinthe aerobic environmentandiscriticalfortrans-
mission (22). In addition to sporulation defects, the S-layer mutant was
also found to produce less toxin in vitro. There have been previous sug-
gestions of feedback between sporulation and the complex regulatory
network controlling toxin production (22). Although the mechanism by
which these processes are affected in SlpA-null mutants is far from clear, it
is possible that the S-layer feeds into a point of cross-talk between regula-
tion of virulence and transmission. Given the poor toxin production and
other diverse phenotypes identified for the S-layer mutant, it is probably
not surprising that the mutant was entirely avirulent in the hamster model
of acute infection. What did come as a surprise, however, was the ability of
the S-layer mutant to stably colonize and persist in the hamster gut for the
14-day duration of the experiment. Previous reports have pointed to a role
for the S-layer in epithelial cell adhesion; however, these earlier studies
were performed without access to an slpA-defective strain (34). The S-
layer–defectivemutantsandisogeniccontrolsexpressingthe SLCT-specific
slpA alleles provide the ideal controls to test these conflicting findings
and better define the effect SlpA type has on these functions.
There are several study limitations that should be considered when
evaluating the data presented. The activity of each new Avidocin-CD
was observed in vitro and needs to be confirmed in an animal treatment
model, as performed for Av-CD291.2. Similarly, the exquisite specificity
of each agent for distinct C. difficile SLCTs also needs to be tested in vivo
to confirm that treatment with these agents will not alter the diversity of
the gut microbiota. The avirulent phenotype and long-term persistence
of the Avidocin-CD–resistant slpA mutantsin the hamstermodelshould
also be confirmed in other animal species. Finally, the implications of the
mutants’ observed sporulation defects on transmission and the spread of
resistance remain to be tested in vivo.
After accounting for these limitations, analysis of the data clearly
demonstrates that acquisition of Avidocin-CD resistance results in loss
of toxin production and complete loss of virulence in the hamster. Very
few described mutations located outside of the PaLoc locus have re-
sulted in complete avirulence in this model (35). The ability of the S-
layer mutant to stably colonize the gut in the absence of clinical disease
reveals that the in vivo lifestyle of the organism is independent of toxin
production and virulence. The prevalence of nontoxigenic, avirulent
C. difficile strains in the general population (36) supports this hypothesis.
Virulence factors make attractive targets for new antimicrobials because
they tend to be species-specific. If their loss does not affect pathogen
fitness, as appears to be the case for the C. difficile S-layer, emergence
of resistance is likely to reduce virulence (3). As a result, we predict
that there will be no competing selective pressure to restore virulence
in the context of Avidocin-CD resistance.
In summary, we have developed and characterized multiple new
Avidocin-CDs, providing crucial insights into their potential advan-
tages in the clinic. The precise killing activity of Avidocin-CDs makes
them attractive agents for both treatment and prevention because they
can be administered to patients without altering the diversity of the com-
plex gut microbiota. In addition, when resistance does emerge, Avidocin-
CDs force the pathogen to sacrifice virulence for viability, making the
potential clinical impact of resistance inconsequential.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The objective of this study was to characterize a panel of Avidocin-CDs,
antibacterial protein complexes constructed to specifically target and
kill C. difficile. During these experiments, the isolation of Avidocin-
CD–resistant slpA mutants allowed detailed analysis of S-layer func-
tion for the first time. Starting from the prototypic Av-CD291.2 (12),
we constructed a panel of new Avidocin-CDs using bacteriophage
RBPs we identified. Each new Avidocin-CD displayed a unique spectrum
of killing activity with a strong correlation to SLCT. Sensitization of two
insensitive C. difficile strains by heterologous expression of a cognate
SLCT SlpA alone allowed identification of the S-layer as the receptor
for all described Avidocin-CDs. Analysis of the slpA mutant identified
previously unsuspected in vitro roles for the S-layer in resistance to the
immune effectors lysozyme and LL-37 and in the production of mature
heat-resistant spores. Finally, use of the Golden Syrian hamster model of
acute infection demonstrated that the slpA mutant was entirely avirulent
despite persistent infection. Greatly reduced toxin activity was detected
in intestinal contents from animals colonized with the slpA mutant, and
this observation was supported by identification of a toxin production
defect in vitro. The design and execution of these animal experiments
are described in detail in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

 Strains, bacteriophage, and culture conditions
Bacterial strains used in this study are described in fig. S2. DNA oligo-
nucleotides are described in table S2. Escherichia coli strains were
routinely grown in Luria broth (LB) and on LB agar (VWR). C. difficile
strains were routinely grown under anaerobic conditions on Brain
Heart Infusion (BHI) or BHI-S agar and in tryptone yeast (TY) broth
(37), except where otherwise stated. Cultures were supplemented with
chloramphenicol (15 mg/ml), thiamphenicol (15 mg/ml), or anhydrote-
tracycline (20 ng/ml) as required. C. difficile SLCTs were determined
by analyzing the nucleotide sequence of the slpA gene. When neces-
sary, the slpA gene was sequenced using oligonucleotide primers previ-
ously described (38, 39) or primers 023-F and 023_010-R or 014+++-F
and 014_002+-R (nucleotide sequences; table S2). The variable region of
strain 19142 (RT046) slpA gene did not display high sequence identity
withother slpA alleles andhasbeen designated SLCT-13. Apartialstrain
19142 slpA sequence was deposited in GenBank (accession number
KX610658). Details of plasmid and strain construction are given in Sup-
plementary Materials and Methods (fig. S11).
Bioassays to determine Avidocin-CD killing activity
Avidocin-CD bactericidal activity was assayed by a semiquantitative
spot method as previously described (12, 13). For broth-based killing
assays, C. difficile strains were grown overnight in TY broth and then
subcultured to an OD600nm of 0.05 in 1-ml fresh TY broth supplemented
with 1 mM CaCl2. Av-CD291.2 (50 ml) was added to each culture after
2.5 hours. Growth was monitored by measuring the OD600nm hourly.
Extraction of S-layer and associated proteins
SLPs were extracted using low-pH glycine as previously described (8)
and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using standard methods.
Quantitative analysis of sporulation and germination
Quantitative analysis of sporulation was carried out as previously de-
scribed (19) and monitored by phase-contrast and transmission electron
microscopy as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Analysis of resistance to lysozyme and LL-37
Broth-based killing assays were carried out as described above but with
lysozyme (500 mg/ml) or LL-37 (5 mg/ml) added after 2.5 hours of
growth. Cell density was monitored by measuring the OD600nm hourly.
Assays were carried out in triplicate on biological duplicates.
Animal experiments
The Golden Syrian hamster model was performed as previously de-
scribed (40). All procedures were performed in strict accordance with
the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 with specific approval
granted by the Home Office, UK (PPL60/4218). Further detail is given
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Quantification of toxin expression
Quantification of toxin activity was performed using Vero cells as de-
scribed previously (40) and by Western immunoblot using anti–toxin B
antibody (MA1-7413, Thermo Fisher). Further details are given in Sup-
plementary Materials and Methods.
Statistical analyses
Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software
Inc.). Toxin production was compared using a two-tailed nonparametric
Mann-Whitney test, and animal survival curves were analyzed using a
log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. All other statistical analyses were performed
using two-tailed t tests with Welch’s correction.
