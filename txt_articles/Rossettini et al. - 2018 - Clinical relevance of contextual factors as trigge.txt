Clinical relevance of contextual factors as
triggers of placebo and nocebo effects in
musculoskeletal pain
Giacomo Rossettini1, Elisa Carlino2 and Marco Testa1*
Abstract
Placebo and nocebo effects are embodied psycho-neurobiological responses capable of modulating pain and
producing changes at different neurobiological, body at perceptual and cognitive levels. These modifications are
triggered by different contextual factors (CFs) presented in the therapeutic encounter between patient and
healthcare providers, such as healing rituals and signs. The CFs directly impact on the quality of the therapeutic
outcome: a positive context, that is a context characterized by the presence of positive CFs, can reduce pain by
producing placebo effects, while a negative context, characterized by the presence of negative CFs, can aggravate
pain by creating nocebo effects. Despite the increasing interest about this topic; the detailed study of CFs as
triggers of placebo and nocebo effects is still lacked in the management of musculoskeletal pain.
Increasing evidence suggest a relevant role of CFs in musculoskeletal pain management. CFs are a complex sets of
internal, external or relational elements encompassing: patient’s expectation, history, baseline characteristics; clinician’s
behavior, belief, verbal suggestions and therapeutic touch; positive therapeutic encounter, patient-centered approach
and social learning; overt therapy, posology of intervention, modality of treatment administration; marketing features of
treatment and health care setting. Different explanatory models such as classical conditioning and expectancy can
explain how CFs trigger placebo and nocebo effects. CFs act through specific neural networks and neurotransmitters
that were described as mediators of placebo and nocebo effects.
Available findings suggest a relevant clinical role and impact of CFs. They should be integrated in the clinical reasoning to
increase the number of treatment solutions, boosts their efficacy and improve the quality of the decision-making. From a
clinical perspective, the mindful manipulation of CFs represents a useful opportunity to enrich a well-established therapy
in therapeutic setting within the ethical border. From a translational perspective, there is a strong need of research studies
on CFs close to routine and real-world clinical practice in order to underline the uncertainty of therapy action and help
clinicians to implement knowledge in daily practice.

 Background
Pain represents a “distressing experience associated with
actual or potential tissue damage with sensory, emo-
tional, cognitive and social components” [1]. Among the
different pain conditions, musculoskeletal pain is ubiqui-
tous and multifaceted: it can be the consequence of
everyday activities that repeatedly or unusually stress the
system, or it can be due to either acute traumatic events
or to musculoskeletal diseases [2]. It is the most disab-
ling symptom in musculoskeletal disorders, causing a
high number of requests for healthcare treatments and
rising social costs [3]. Moreover, especially in chronic
conditions when pain persists beyond the normal heal-
ing time, it is influenced by different physical, psycho-
logical and social factors [4–6] defined as “contextual
factors” (CFs).
The multidimensionality that characterizes pain in mus-
culoskeletal complaints requires an integrative and per-
sonalized approach for its treatment. For this reason, the
study of the CFs and their conscious use and integration
in the clinical practice could represent a novel approach
in the management of this complex experience [7–16].
By definition, CFs are physical, psychological and
social elements that characterize the therapeutic en-
counter with the patient [17, 18]. CFs are actively inter-
preted by the patient and are capable of eliciting
expectations, memories and emotions that in turn can
influence the health-related outcome, producing placebo
or nocebo effects [19]. In other words, the CFs represent
the context that accompany any healthcare treatment:
the exposure of a patient to a positive context (positive
CFs) very often produces a placebo effect that is the
occurrence of symptoms improvement (e.g. analgesia),
whereas a negative context (negative CFs) can generate a
nocebo effect, with a worsening of the pain condition
(e.g. hyperalgesia) [20, 21]. In the following review, we
use the term CFs instead of placebo, avoiding the mis-
leading interpretation of placebo as inert treatment given
to comfort or please the patient and following the recent
conceptualization of the placebo as the psychosocial
context that accompanies any medical intervention, be it
active or sham [22–31].
As extensively demonstrated by the placebo and
nocebo effect literature, the CFs can affect the outcome
of a treatment with different mechanisms and in differ-
ent systems, medical conditions, and therapeutic inter-
ventions [32]. From a clinical perspective, the study of
CFs as triggers of placebo and nocebo effects, is crucial
for the management of musculoskeletal pain for several
reasons [33]. First, even if CFs are embodied in every
complex therapeutic interventions in musculoskeletal
complaints, they are often considered as incidental fac-
tors capable to affect outcomes. For this reason they are
not always identified and used intentionally by clinicians
[34]. Second, CFs can produce a therapeutic effect
through the involvement of the same central pathways
of pain modulation activated by several hands-on (e.g.
manual
therapy,
therapeutic
exercises,
acupuncture,
injections) and hands-off solutions (e.g. pain neurosci-
ence education) commonly applied in clinical practice
[35–37]. Third, CFs serve as additional tools for the in-
terpretation of the clinical picture and guide clinicians in
managing the complexity behind the patient’s musculo-
skeletal pain [38]. Taking into consideration CFs as ac-
tive influencer of the therapeutic outcomes, can help to
explain some unexpected outcomes and variability of
symptoms experience [39].
Moving from this vision, the present debate is pro-
posed to all the health professionals (physiotherapists,
chiropractors, osteopaths, nurses, occupational thera-
pists, rheumatologists, orthopedics etc.) that work with
musculoskeletal pain. In order to support a better and
more conscientious therapeutic use of the CFs in mus-
culoskeletal field, the purposes of this debate are to: 1)
briefly define the CFs, how they work and act from a
neurophysiological perspective; 2) underline their clinical
relevance in pain management; 3) consider their role in
clinical reasoning, within the ethical border and 4) sug-
gest how to take them into account in the research field.
Contextual factors
What do the contextual factors represent?
A treatment is never administered in a neutral situation,
but rather in a complex set of CFs, that Balint called the
“atmosphere around the treatment” [40] and Miller and
Kaptchuk called “contextual healing” [41]. Following
these definitions, it is clear that the CFs can act “inde-
pendently” by the nature of the treatment: since they
represent the context of any medical treatment, they
have a role when a sham treatment is administered but
also when an active treatment is administered.
CFs were introduced in 2001 by Di Blasi et al. [17] in
medical community and recently exploited by Testa &
Rossettini in physiotherapy field [33]. CFs can be in-
ternal, external or relational. The internal factors consist
of memories, emotions, expectations and psychological
characteristics of the patient; the external factors include
the physical aspects of therapy, such as the kind of treat-
ment (pharmacological or manual) and the place in
which the treatment is delivered. Relational factors are
represented by all the social cues that characterizes the
patient-physiotherapist relationship, such as the verbal
information that the physiotherapist gives to the patient,
the communication style or the body language [19].
A clear identification of the CFs is crucial in clinical
practice, in order to enhance the treatment efficacy. In a
work targeted to physiotherapy field, CFs have been
grouped in 5 different categories on the base of their
Rossettini et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2018) 19:27 
Page 2 of 15
 sensory and social features [33]: physiotherapist charac-
teristics (professional reputation, appearance, beliefs,
behaviours); patient characteristics (expectation, prefer-
ences, previous experience, musculoskeletal condition,
gender, age); patient-physiotherapist relationship (verbal
communication, non-verbal communication), treatment
(clear diagnosis, overt therapy, observational learning,
patient-centered approach, global process of care, thera-
peutic touch), healthcare setting (environment, architec-
ture, interior design).
During any clinical phase (e.g. consultation, examin-
ation and treatment) the CFs “inform” the patient that a
healthcare procedure has been delivered and they could
positively
or
negatively
affect
symptom
perception,
experience and meaning [20, 21].
The identification of the CFs and the attention to
healthcare context is crucial for at least two reasons.
First, a treatment delivered in a positive context (positive
CFs) produces better outcomes than a treatment deliv-
ered in a neutral condition or negative context (negative
CFs). The open-hidden approach is one of the best
evidence of decreased effectiveness of a medical treat-
ment when a meaningful context is eliminated [42]. In
the “open” condition, that mimics the routine medical
practice, a treatment is delivered in full view of the
patient: it means that the patient is aware of receiving a
medical treatment and know when the medical treat-
ment is delivered. In the “hidden” condition, the treat-
ment
is administered
unbeknownst
to the
patient.
Different studies have reported that open treatments are
more effective than hidden treatments, because in the
hidden condition the surrounding context (healing rit-
uals, therapist-patient interaction, etc.) is absent, thus
losing its positive meaning [43–46].
Second, the psychosocial context can influence the
patients in different ways since the responsiveness to the
context seems to be not a stable trait but a situational
trait [47], and the same patient can sometimes positively
respond to the context and sometimes not. Thus, if a
patient is not influenced by the therapeutic context (the
so called “placebo non-responders”) he/she needs more
medical attention because the lower the placebo respon-
siveness, the lower the treatment responsiveness [48].
Indeed, if the total treatment effect is conceptualized as
the sum of the CFs effect plus the active treatment effect
plus the interaction of the CFs and active treatment effects
[49], a patient that is not sensible to the positive influence
of the CFs will show a lower treatment response [50].
How do the contextual factors trigger placebo and
nocebo effects?
If we aim to implement an aware use of CFs along the
clinical routine, the understanding of how they work has
a capital importance. The CFs shape placebo and nocebo
effects through different sources. Historically, the most
important models include classical conditioning and
expectation processes.
Following the classical conditioning, different external
CFs represent an example of conditioned stimuli that
evoke a conditioned response [51]. In general, as pro-
posed by this model, the repeated contingency between
a salient unconditioned stimulus (e.g., sight of food) with
a neutral conditioned stimulus (e.g., a bell ringing) can
induce the same conditioned response (i.e., salivation)
even if the neutral stimulus is presented alone. In the
specific contest of healthcare, different aspects of the
healthcare setting or physical features of the medical
treatment can act as external conditioned stimuli, elicit-
ing a therapeutic response in the absence of an active
principle, just because they have been previously associ-
ated with it. Recently, other learning mechanisms has
been documented, such social learning. In particular,
beyond direct first-hand experience to specific external
CFs, it is possible to learn a conditioned response by
observing other people that respond to specific CFs [9].
Following the expectation model, different external,
internal and relational CFs can activate the expectancy
of pain relief, triggering neurobiological changes and
symptoms’ amelioration [52]. Verbal suggestions are
typical external CFs that trigger positive or negative
responses. For example, the administration of an anal-
gesic treatment along with the expectations of pain relief
can lead to a positive analgesic response, whereas the
administration of an analgesic treatment without specific
expectations or with expectations or pain exacerbation
can result in a negative response and in the perpetration
of pain [53].
Following the Colloca and Miller integrative model [54],
conditioning and expectations are not mutually exclusive
and can be integrated in a more general learning model,
whereby various types of CFs trigger expectancies, memor-
ies and emotions that in turn generate behavioral and
clinical outcome changes, through the activation of the cen-
tral nervous system (Fig. 1) [7, 9, 20, 21]. In other words,
the presence of external CFs, combined with specific in-
ternal and relational CFs, is interpreted by the patient and
converted into neural input events and behavioral changes
[54]. This model represents a good conceptualization of the
role of the therapeutic context, useful also at the clinical
practice level. Indeed, it opens up to the possibility to study
the effects and the impacts of every single CF on the out-
come of a medical treatment.
How do the contextual factors work at the
neurobiological level?
A robust body of knowledge, especially acquired in the
field of pain, has identified the neural networks activated
by the CFs. Indeed, a crucial question that catch the
Rossettini et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2018) 19:27 
Page 3 of 15
 attention of neuroscientists and clinicians is whether the
subjective changes in the outcome after the exposure to
a specific therapeutic context are associated with specific
neurobiological activities [10]. Pharmacological studies,
as well as neuroimaging studies, have address this ques-
tion using different experimental approaches based on
classical conditioning and modulation of expectations.
Taken together, these studies demonstrated that different
changes in the pain processing network occurs when
positive or negative CFs trigger placebo or nocebo
effects, respectively. In particular, pain reduction is asso-
ciated with decreased activity in the classical pain-matrix
areas, such as the thalamus, insula, somatosensory cor-
tex, and mid-cingulate regions [55–60]. Interestingly,
positron emission tomography (PET) studies showed
that the analgesic effect induced by the administration of
a real mu-agonist, such as remifentanil, and the anal-
gesic effect triggered by verbal suggestions determined
similar activation of different brain regions, such as
rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the orbital cortex
[61, 62]. Separating the pain anticipation phase and the
pain perception phase, a meta-analysis of brain imaging
data using the activation likelihood estimation method,
identified the involvement of different brain regions:
during expectation, areas of activation are found in the an-
terior cingulate, precentral and lateral prefrontal cortex,
and in the periaqueductal gray, whereas during pain inhib-
ition, deactivations are found in the mid- and posterior
cingulate cortex, superior temporal and precentral gyri, in
the anterior and posterior insula, in the claustrum and
putamen, and in the thalamus and caudate body [63]. On
the other hand, pain increase is associated with signal
increases in several regions including anterior cingulate
cortex, insula, left frontal and parietal operculum [64–67].
Also, high temporal resolution techniques, such as elec-
troencephalography (EEG), have confirmed that the amp-
litude of specific evoked potentials, both related to pain
anticipation and to pain perception, are affected by the
CFs [68–71]. Thus, both early and late sensory compo-
nents of pain processing are affected by the exposure to
positive and negative CFs.
Different studies have also characterized the neuro-
transmitter systems activated the CFs. Using a classical
conditioning approach, it has been demonstrated that
when an opioid drug, such as morphine, is delivered for
different days and then it is replaced by a placebo unbe-
knownst to the patient a placebo analgesic effect occurs
[72]. This effect can be blocked by the mu opioid antagon-
ist, naloxone, thus indicating that the opioid system plays
an important role [57, 73, 74]. An indirect evidence of the
involvement of the opioid system comes from the study of
the anti-opioid action of the cholecystokinin (CCK) system.

 The proglumide, that is a CCK antagonist, enhances pla-
cebo analgesia [75, 76], whereas the activation of the CCK
type-2 receptors with the agonist pentagastrin disrupts it
[77]. These pharmacological data have been confirmed by a
neuroimaging study, in which the authors proved that na-
loxone blocked the placebo analgesic response in dorsolat-
eral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), rostral anterior cingulate
cortex (rACC), hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray (PAG),
and rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM), and abolished
placebo-enhanced coupling between rACC and PAG [57].
Using a the same conditioning protocol, it has been dem-
onstrated that also the cannabinoid system is activated by
the positive therapeutic context: when non-opioid drugs,
like ketorolac, are administered for 2 days in a row and
then replaced with a placebo on the third day, the analgesic
effect is not reversed by naloxone, whereas the CB1 canna-
binoid receptor antagonist, rimonabant, blocks this placebo
analgesia completely [78]. Also studies in which expecta-
tions were manipulated by positive verbal suggestions,
showed an activation of μ-opioid neurotransmission in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex,
the insula, and the nucleus accumbens [79, 80].
A different system activated by the therapeutic context
is the dopaminergic system: indeed, the positive effect
due to the presence of positive CFs seems to be related
to the activation of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens.
as assessed using in vivo receptor binding PET with
raclopride. Moreover, when expectations of pain reduc-
tion were induced, the analgesic effect of the context
was associated with activation of opioid neurotransmis-
sion in the anterior cingulate, orbitofrontal and insular
cortices, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and periaque-
ductal gray matter. Dopaminergic activation was ob-
served in the ventral basal ganglia, including the nucleus
accumbens. Both dopaminergic and opioid activity were
associated with both anticipation and perceived effect-
iveness of the positive verbal suggestions [81, 82].
Recently, oxytocin [83] and vasopressin [84] have been
identified CFs enhancer as they potentiate the analgesic
effect due to the presence of positive verbal suggestions.
Moreover it has been documented that negative expecta-
tions about headache pain led to the enhancement of
the cyclooxygenase-prostaglandins pathway, which, in
turn, induced pain worsening [85].
Clinical relevance of the contextual factors
What is the magnitude of placebo and nocebo effects
induced by CFs in musculoskeletal pain?
The impact of CFs as trigger of placebo and nocebo
effects on pain outcome has been quantified in different
ways and has been reported in a wide range of musculo-
skeletal conditions such as low back pain [86–108], neck
pain [95, 99, 109–111], shoulder pain [95, 112, 113],
osteoarthritis [38, 91, 99, 100, 114–125], rheumatoid
arthritis [126], and fibromyalgia [97, 127–132].
Different studies have measured the magnitude of
placebo and nocebo effects induced by CFs in different
musculoskeletal pain conditions commonly encounter in
daily setting [117, 133]. Indeed the clinical effectiveness
of placebo analgesia was demonstrated in specific com-
plaints such as fibromyalgia [128] and osteoarthritis
[118] with an effect size (ES) over 0.5. Also, nocebo
hyperalgesia measured as dropout rate due to adverse
event were present in fibromyalgia (9.6%) [134] and
osteoarthritis (4.8%) [135]. Concerning osteoarthritis, the
ES decreased consistently from hand, to knee, to com-
bined hip and knee and then to hip [118, 136].
Moreover, considering the overall treatment efficacy as
the sum of the specific component related to the active
treatment plus the unspecific component due to the
CFs, the impact of the CFs was measured in different
conditions and interventions [137]. Zou and colleagues
showed that 75% of the overall treatment effect in osteo-
arthritis is attributable to contextual effects rather than
the specific effect of treatments [116]. In fibromyalgia,
the 45% of the response of the active drug is attributable
to contextual effect [129] and a relevant contextual
effects was shown also in aspecific low back pain [138].
Moreover, a recent meta-analysis on spinal manual ther-
apies showed that in acute pain and chronic pain, re-
spectively 81 and 66% of the pain variance were ascribed
to CFs [139].
Which kind of CFs influence musculoskeletal pain
conditions?
Considering the patient’s perspective, expectations to-
ward the therapy, patient’s treatment history and base-
line pain severity are elements capable to predict the
outcomes of different musculoskeletal pain treatments.
Expectations of symptoms improvement can be acti-
vated by different CFs: for example, the simple act of
administering a treatment, the exposure to a clinical set-
ting, the verbal or non-verbal interaction with the phys-
ician are capable of triggering patient’s expectations. As
demonstrated by different studies, boosting patient’s
expectations toward the therapy significantly increased
the chance of pain relief more than delivering a treat-
ment without the expectation of any benefit [86, 90–98,
109, 111, 112, 126, 140].
Patient’s treatment history, that is the patient’s history
of past positive or negative medical treatments, can
influence the future response of the patient to new
medical treatments. Previous positive experiences ob-
tained by a specific therapy increase the likelihood of fu-
ture positive experiences with the same therapy, while
precedent negative outcomes associated to a particular
Rossettini et al. BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders  (2018) 19:27 
Page 5 of 15
 intervention increase the probability of negative out-
comes [99, 141].
Higher pain intensity at baseline [99, 100, 118, 128, 129]
and the presence of concomitant diseases and psycho-
social elements such as depressions [99, 130] are associ-
ated with an augmented placebo analgesia and reduced
nocebo hyperalgesia. Long-term dysfunction seems to
respond less to placebo analgesia indicating that duration
of complaints influence placebo analgesia [128, 132].
From the provider’s perspective, clinician’s behavior,
belief, verbal suggestions and therapeutic touch can
strongly influence patients’ pain perception.
A provider acting as competent, experienced, edu-
cated, professional, trustworthy, capable to indicate a
diagnosis and prognosis, and to monitor patient with
follow up, can moderate pain with his behavior [38, 114,
115, 120, 142]. Aligning his/her beliefs with patient’s
beliefs, a clinician could modulate pain. Indeed, it was
demonstrated that the healthcare provider’s point of
view concerning the clinical pathway, the therapy and
the prognosis influence patient’s pain [38, 101–103, 107,
114, 115, 143, 144]. Informing the patient that a potent
treatment has been delivered enhanced the analgesic
effect of the treatment, conversely verbal suggestion
concerning the threatening effect of the therapy can
compromise the effectiveness of the treatment creating
nocebo hyperalgesic effects [108, 121, 122, 141, 145,
146]. Non-verbal communication has powerful effects as
well. For example, the use of therapeutic touch can posi-
tively influence patient’s pain [105, 123, 124, 131, 147, 148].
Finally, considering the patient-physician relationship,
it appears that a positive therapeutic encounter between
patient and clinicians can lead to additional clinical ben-
efits. Indeed, an enhanced empathetic interaction com-
prehensive of therapeutic alliance, active listening, extra
time spent with patient, more face-to-face visit, warmth,
attention, care, encouragement and support significantly
reduced pain more than the same therapy performed
with neutral therapeutic interaction [87, 88, 100, 104,
145, 149, 150]. Moreover, a patient-centered approach
can increase the effectiveness of the therapy. Indeed, the
patient’s involvement in the global process of care has
been shown to modulate pain [106, 125]. The strategy to
favor the social learning between patients by the obser-
vation of other’s pain improvement or reduction is cap-
able to affect the observers’ symptomatology [151, 152].
Also the way by which the therapy is administered can
influence pain perception. The adoption of an overt
paradigm that enhances patient’s knowledge of being
treated modulates the therapeutic outcome [110]: a
significant pain reduction was observed after the execu-
tion of an exercise in an environment that allowed
patients to visualize their body [89]. Also the posology of
intervention has an effect as CFs: the placebo effect is
higher when therapies are more frequent and repeated a
therapy is delivered (e.g. two or more times vs one time)
[118]. The choice of the modality of treatment adminis-
tration can be crucial to modulate patient’s pain. In
general, the higher is the invasiveness of treatment (e.g.
acupuncture, dry needling, injection, surgery), the better
is the reduction of pain [116, 118, 119, 153, 154]. More-
over, parenteral or subcutaneous administrations (e.g.
topical) are more efficient than oral administrations
[115, 116, 119].
Even the marketing features of treatment should be
taken into account. Branded therapy seems to be more
effective than unbranded therapy [114, 115]. High prize
medication produced better pain relief then discounted
medication, therapy considered as “new” improved pain
more than “usual” therapy [114, 115]. The more com-
plex is the procedure including therapeutic rituals, mys-
terious powers, high technology the larger the placebo
effect [114, 115].
Lastly, the health care setting, in terms of environ-
ment, architecture and interior design should not be
overlooked. The use of facilities where evidence-based
design such as furnishing, colors, artwork, light, outside
views, temperature, soothing sound and music were
adopted, positively impacts on patient’s pain creating a
proper healing setting [127, 155–157].
Clinical applications and translational research
Is it time to implement CFs in our clinical reasoning?
The clinical reasoning adopted by clinicians in musculo-
skeletal conditions represents a complex procedure that
encompasses different dimensions of pain experience in
a bio-psycho-social framework [158]. Indeed, this multi-
factorials thinking process considered biomedical (e.g.
tissue pathology, disease), psychological and social ele-
ments (e.g. experience of disability, patient’s belief,
values and perspective) to obtain more complete ana-
lyses of the patient’s dysfunction [159]. The role and the
impact of CFs should be integrated in the clinical rea-
soning to increase the number of treatment solutions,
boosts their efficacy and improve the quality of the
decision-making [33]. Based on the evidence available,
some considerations can be drawn to guide a more
conscious use of CFs as activators of placebo analgesia
and avoiders of nocebo hyperalgesia.
Considering the global process of care, clinicians
should be aware that the overall therapeutic outcome is
determined by the suitability of the therapy adopted
(“what we do”) and by how it is delivered (“how we do”)
[33]. In this perspective, every musculoskeletal pain
treatment is composed by a specific component and by a
contextual component [34]. These components repre-
sent the two faces of the same coin and are capable of
influencing pain at multiple levels of the central nervous

 system [160]. The use of the best evidence-based therapy
is unquestionable, but clinicians should not forget the
role of the CFs, as the context surrounding the specific
treatment is capable of generating placebo or nocebo
responses
and
modifying
the
therapeutic
trajectory
towards a positive or a negative direction [42].
Because it is a fact that placebo [161–163] and nocebo
[164] effects are always present in routine clinical prac-
tice and can be triggered by CFs [33], clinicians should
be able to use them to optimize the results and reduce
failures. Indeed, there are clear evidence that, when pla-
cebo was purposely searched as a mechanism, the effect
size was about five times greater (Cohen’s d ranging
from 0.95 to 1.14) [161–163] than when placebo was
used as a control condition (Cohen’s d ranging from
0.15 to 0.27) [165–167]. Moreover, clinicians should
combine at the same time different CFs to obtain a larger
placebo effect and minimize the nocebo effects. Some
studies demonstrated that a lower effect size is present
when using verbal suggestions alone (placebo - Cohen’s d
= 0.85; nocebo - Cohen’s d = 0.65), while a higher effect
size was observed adopting a combination of verbal sug-
gestions and conditioning procedures (placebo - Cohen’s
d = 1.45; nocebo - Cohen’s d = 1.07) [161, 164].
Since placebo effects are learning phenomenon [9],
during the history taking, clinicians should assess the
patient’s previous experience, expectations and beliefs
giving the patient adequate time to tell his/her story
[50, 168, 169] (Fig. 2).
Previous successful and unsuccessful experiences of a
specific treatment are capable to influence the thera-
peutic outcome [170]. In order to plan a therapeutic
intervention, it’s important to question about past mem-
ories of analgesic and hyperalgesic responses concerning
a treatment; reinforcing the positive experiences and
devaluating the negative ones [7, 169, 171–173]. For
example, if a patient had a previous negative experience
with a specific treatment, clinician should avoid adopting
it. On the contrary, if a patient experienced a positive
outcome with a treatment, the use of the very same
treatment is recommended in order to “activate” the
patient’s positive memory of the previous treatment.
Since patients’ expectations about the therapeutic
benefit influence the effectiveness of the treatment, a
clear assessment of patients’ expectations toward the
therapy is crucial. In particular, it is crucial to identify
patients with low expectations in order to work with
them with the aim of improving their belief [174].

 Different scale and semi-standardized questionnaires
have been proposed to assess patient’s expectations. For
example, Younger et al. developed a tool for measuring
patient outcome expectancy. The authors found that the
final six-item scales, made of two subscales (positive
expectancy and negative expectancy), predicted a signifi-
cant amount of outcome variance in patients receiving
surgical and pain intervention [175].
Moreover, clinicians should monitor patient’s belief
concerning musculoskeletal conditions, therapeutic ac-
tion, prognosis and ask questions about the meaning
they attribute to symptoms [169, 172, 176–178]. In these
times of important expansion of healthcare information
delivering by Internet, social media and television it is
crucial to avoid the misinformation [7]. The discussion
with the patients can help the clinician to guide them to
evidence-based information and avoid that they refer to
unproven or fake information [176]. Also, asking system-
atically the patients to summarize the information pro-
vided can prevent negative misunderstandings about their
complaints [169, 173, 176, 178].
In the waiting, examination, therapeutic and follow-up
phases, the social interaction between patients [179, 180],
the therapeutic ritual [181, 182] and the awareness of the
ongoing procedure [42, 43] are fundamental elements
to consider.
While waiting for healthcare encounter, a pleasant and
peaceful environment, employing professional, friendly
and helpful support staff can help patients to feel com-
fortable [169]. In waiting rooms, clinicians should reduce
the social contagion of negative emotions preventing the
patient’s
interaction
and/or
observation
of
another
patient experiencing a negative outcome (e.g. increased
pain) [7, 183]. Instead, they should promote the social
interaction favoring observation of the positive effects of
the therapy (e.g reduction of pain) also using video clips
showing patients coping well with painful condition
[50, 176, 179, 180] (Fig. 3).
Before starting the treatment clinicians should read
records, thoroughly examine the patients, provide a
confident diagnosis and propose, when available, dif-
ferent
treatment
options
encouraging
the
patient’s
involvement in the choice of therapy and treatment
goals [169, 171, 184–186].
During treatment it is useful to avoid unintentional
“hidden administration” of therapy [173]. Thus, it is
crucial to focus the patient’s attention to all the salient
sensory elements presented in the therapeutic arena in
order to increase the contextual power of the therapy
[169]. These elements are: the healthcare environment
(e.g. light, color, design of the room), the physical fea-
tures of the therapy (e.g. shape, size, colour, smell and

 taste) and the technological features of the device (e.g.
novelty, price, invasiveness) [50, 169–173, 187] (Fig. 4).
After the treatment, it is valuable to assess the thera-
peutic outcome and give to patient a feedback on the
clinical course in order to maximize the treatment ad-
herence, encouraging the self-managing of the condition
[50, 169].
The clinician’s not-verbal and verbal communication
represent important element of the overall clinical
interaction [33].
Clinicians should prepare themselves mentally and
physically for the clinical encounter [38], acting as experts
in their field [169, 172]. It is crucial to effectively inform
about the efficacy of a specific treatment [169, 172],
considering that beliefs and behaviors could influence
patients’ attitudes in a positive or negative way [7, 169]. It
is suitable to individualize consultation style according to
the patient’s preference opting for a personal interaction
and seeking for a warm, authentic and empathic style,
limiting technical contacts to the minimum [169, 171,
172, 176, 188–190].
Also, the content of the message (what), the modality
of delivering (how) and the time of communication
(when) represent a great clinical enigma [191] and
should be taken into account. It is recommended to
enhance the positive expectation toward the treatment
and limit the emphasis on contraindications, tell patients
about side effects, but associated with positive clinical
outcome. Side effects of treatment should be presented
in form of probability instead of a mere list and during
the informed consent process positive and negative
information should be balanced [7, 50, 169, 172, 173,
176, 180, 183, 191, 192].
What is the concern about ethics?
The adoption of placebo strategies seems to be common
practice in clinical routine among healthcare providers
[193].
In
musculoskeletal
field,
orthopedics
surgeon,
rheumatology physicians and nurses thought that placebo
effects are real, have therapeutic benefits, and are permis-
sible within the ethical borders [194–196]. Patients with
chronic musculoskeletal pain and rheumatologic com-
plaints know what placebo effects are, consider placebo
treatments acceptable when adopted as complementary/ad-
junct treatments and when no other established treatments
are available. However, they present a lack of understanding
of nocebo effects [196–198]. Scientific community is still
focusing the debate on the possibility of a transparent dis-
closure to patients of placebo treatments [199–202]. The
current researches suggest the possibility to openly pre-
scribe sham medication or sham physical treatments with
advanced prior consent [169]. Thus, when available the
choice of the best evidence-based therapy is mandatory and
a patient must be informed about the use of a placebo

therapeutic outcome; b a poor therapeutic context capable to produce negative therapeutic outcome

 intervention with an amount of disclosure sufficient to
avoid deception [201, 203, 204]. Although it is common
thought that revealing the use of a placebo inhibits its
effect, different studies point out the efficacy of placebo in-
terventions also in “open label” conditions where the use of
a placebo was disclosed in patients with chronic low back
pain [205, 206]. From a clinical perspective, the mindful
manipulation of CFs represents a useful opportunity to
enrich a well-established therapy that have different ethical
implication in comparison with the replacement of real
treatment with a potentially ineffective treatment [200].
Is there a place for a translational research on CFs?
There is a strong need of research studies on CFs close
to routine and real-world clinical practice [49, 207] in
order to underline the uncertainty of therapy action
[208] and help clinicians to implement knowledge in
daily practice.
The research community should investigate the effect
of the different CFs on therapeutic outcome, instead of
minimizing or labeling them exclusively as confounders
[209, 210]. The search for a good placebo control in
musculoskeletal pain field (e.g. physical therapy) repre-
sents an unresolved challenge [211, 212]. Indeed, med-
ical treatments are generally more complex than the
mere administration of a drug, involving multiple treat-
ment components that interact with each other and that
are difficult to separate (e.g. verbal instruction and
education, patient-therapist contact, physical action by
the patient or therapist, and sensory feedback) leading to
biased estimates of treatment effect [213].
In clinical trial there is a urge to measure patient’s
expectation before, during, and after the treatment [214]
evaluating by standardized and validated scale all the di-
mensions of expectation (optimism, pain catastrophiz-
ing, hope, trust, worry and neuroticism) [215, 216]. Also
measuring the impact of CFs from the patient’s perspec-
tive represents a desirable outcome to be implemented
in the future researches. Recently, a new item banks
(Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists - HEAL) was
proposed as suitable for measuring CFs of the treatment
and present promising evidence of predictive and con-
current validity [217].
Despite CFs play a key role in pain [20, 21], there is a
still paucity of knowledge on their effects in different
musculoskeletal diseases, in young and old participants
[218–220], in acute and chronic conditions [141], in
different pain mechanism such as nociceptive, neuro-
pathic, central sensitization [221]. It is of paramount
importance to try to identify psychological, neuroendo-
crine or genetic elements that predict the responsiveness
to specific CFs [50]. Finally, the use of meta-analysis
may help to estimate the effects of the CFs [222].
Limitations
This debate presents some limitations. The framework
adopted [17, 33] for reviewing the role of the CFs was
not preliminarily validated for its specific consistency in
the musculoskeletal field and some factors are not
related exclusively to musculoskeletal pain literature but
refer to pain in general. Examples of primary studies and
data offered to sustain each factors of the model were
not selected by adopting a systematic review approach
and not criticized in depth, given that the main goal was
to propose a short synopsis. CFs have been categorized
into a conceptual framework by describing each factor
involved, therefore interpretations about the relation-
ships between factors and placebo/nocebo effects need
additional critical analysis and discussion.
Conclusion
This debate points to a conscious use of the CFs, as
supplementary therapeutic strategy for pain manage-
ment capable to improve analgesia and prevent hyper-
algesia. The good news is that pain perception can be
positively influenced by an honest and aware use of CFs.
The bad news is related to the complexity of the
phenomenon, to a certain degree of uncertainty in the
individual response and to a risk of patient’s deception
associated with their use. Nevertheless, clinicians have
already enough comprehensive scientific information
that allows them to choose the correct behavior wisely
and adjust the CFs of the therapeutic setting in an
evidence-based and ethically respectful perspective. We
think that time has come for clinicians to manage con-
scientiously and ethically the CFs to enhance the placebo
and avoid nocebo effects for the benefit of their patients.
