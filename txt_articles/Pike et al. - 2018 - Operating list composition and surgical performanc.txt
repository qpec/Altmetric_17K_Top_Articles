Background: Recent reviews suggest that the way in which surgeons prepare for a procedure (warm up)
can affect performance. Operating lists present a natural experiment to explore this phenomenon. The
aim was to use a routinely collected large data set on surgical procedures to understand the relationship
between case list order and operative performance.
Method: Theatre lists involving the 35 procedures performed most frequently by senior surgeons across
38 private hospitals in the UK over 26 months were examined. A linear mixed-effects model and matched
analysis were used to estimate the impact of list order and the cost of switching between procedures on a
list while controlling for key prognosticators. The influence of procedure method (open versus minimally
invasive) and complexity was also explored.
Results: The linear mixed-effects model included 255 757 procedures, and the matched analysis 48 632
pairs of procedures. Repeating the same procedure in a list resulted in an overall time saving of 0⋅98
per cent for each increase in list position. Switching between procedures increased the duration by an
average of 6⋅48 per cent. The overall reduction in operating time from completing the second procedure
straight after the first was 6⋅18 per cent. This pattern of results was consistent across procedure method
and complexity.
Conclusion: There is a robust relationship between operating list composition and surgical performance
(indexed by duration of operation). An evidence-based approach to structuring a theatre list could reduce
the total operating time.

Introduction
There is the potential for large routinely collected clin-
ical data sets to improve healthcare delivery1–3. More
specifically, systematic and statistical examination of oper-
ating records could provide novel insights into surgical
practice4–8. Given that operating theatres are one of the
costliest elements of a hospital9, these advances present
important new opportunities for understanding how to
improve surgical quality and efficiency10,
11.
Examining routinely collected data from the operating
theatre allows the creation of natural experiments (where
exposure to the event of interest has not been manipulated
experimentally12,
13). This allows the description, character-
ization and prediction of organizational, administrative and
human factor-related behaviours.
Previous studies have implicated a number of factors that
influence the amount of time it takes for a surgeon to per-
form a procedure. Beyond the surgeon’
s level of skill14,
15,
research has demonstrated the influence of external drivers
on procedure duration, including: patient characteristics15
(for example age14,
16, co-morbidities such as BMI17–19),
the surgical team20,
21, hospital size22 and case mix23. Recent
reviews24,
25 have suggested that the way in which surgeons
prepare for an operation can also affect performance, with
some preparation techniques resulting in shorter operat-
ing times. The majority of these studies involved simulated
contexts26,
27 and conclusions about best practice for prepa-
ration in the real world remain unclear.
Operating lists present a natural experiment to test
the hypothesis that surgeons will warm up progressively
through practice, and that such benefits will be ameliorated

when surgeons switch procedures in a theatre list. Exam-
ination of the impact of list order may also yield impor-
tant information about service organization efficiency28.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that some surgeons sched-
ule what is perceived to be their most difficult operation
first. This may be sensible but, to date, there is no evi-
dence base to support such practice. Similarly, there has
been no investigation of whether a list should be unimodal
(1 procedure and/or method, for example open or min-
imally invasive) or multimodal in composition. Analysis
of routinely collected information on surgical procedures
presents an opportunity to move away from using clini-
cal intuition and experience-driven decisions to data-driven
decision-making29–32. T
o this end, the aim of this study was
to examine the effect of operating list order on duration
of operation in procedures performed across all 38 Spire
Healthcare hospitals, one of the largest providers of private
healthcare in the UK.
Methods
This study received ethical approval from the Spire Health-
care Research Ethics Committee. Data were collated from
Spire Healthcare’
s electronic patient record system (SAP
SE, Walldorf, Germany) across all 38 UK hospitals. T
o
practice in a private hospital in the UK, a surgeon must
be on the General Medical Council’
s specialist register and
hold, or have held in the past 5 years, a substantive consul-
tant post within the National Health Service (NHS) or a
Defence Medical Services hospital. Consequently, all pro-
cedures in these hospitals were performed by experienced
consultant surgeons, assisted if appropriate by trainees.
Patient demographics, procedural/operative information,
prognosticators of operative outcome (ASA physical status
grade33) and duration of hospital stay were included in the
data set. Age was divided into groups, to allow adequate
anonymization of data (18 or less, 19–24, 25–34, 35–44,
45–54, 55–64, 65–75, over 75 years). No additional infor-
mation (such as sex or co-morbidity) was available to the
research team.
The 35 most frequently observed operations in the data
set were the primary focus of investigation. No restriction
was placed on the surgical subspecialty, type of procedure
performed, or techniques used by the operating surgeon to
perform the procedure. The collated data were parsed to
allow further analysis; individual surgeon’
s operating lists
were identified, and any list that contained one of the most
frequent 35 operations was included in the data set (98 291
theatre lists). Any other procedure performed during one
of those lists was also included in the data set (255 757
procedures in total).

Component operations were allocated absolute and
procedure-specific order numbers. The absolute list
number refers to the number of procedures performed
by the operating surgeon on the list, whereas the
procedure-specific list number is the number of times
a certain procedure has been performed by the surgeon on
a list. All cases that involved a change from the previous
procedure were coded as a switch, because they involved
some form of task switching (Table 1).
Procedures were also classified by method (open or mini-
mally invasive surgery) and complexity, in accordance with
the AXA Specalist Procedure Codes, which are used to
grade the magnitude of surgical procedures in UK inde-
pendent hospitals (Table S1, supporting information)34.
From the original data set comprising 478 519 individ-
ual procedures, 8807 were excluded because they had no
surgeon identifier associated with them and 1422 because
no start time was recorded (Fig. 1). Thirty-two dupli-
cate records were also removed. Although such instances
were relatively trivial to identify, a more difficult chal-
lenge in analysing routinely collected data lay in identify-
ing cases where erroneous data might have been entered,
for example the wrong start time or procedure type, or
instances where missing data might have been due to the
procedure ultimately being cancelled. All of these factors
are likely to influence procedure order classification. This
introduced noise, which it was reasoned would work against
the hypothesis being tested (because the hypothesis sug-
gests that the preceding operation (n – 1) affects the sub-
sequent one; where data are missing, using n – 2 would
make it more likely that the hypothesis would be rejected).
Importantly, because of the statistical power afforded by
a data set of this size, this noise in the data was tolerated
rather than adjusting list order numbering, which would
have required subjective inferences.
Duration of operation was employed as the primary
outcome measure. Generally, this measure was defined as
the time from skin incision to skin closure. In procedures
where a skin incision is not made (such as endoscopic exam-
ination), the time taken for the procedure to be performed

set
(defined as time from insertion to withdrawal of the
endoscope for endoscopic examinations) was used. This
measure was chosen because it is strongly correlated with
surgeon performance, the focus of the study35, and previ-
ous studies36–40 have shown a relationship between this
variable and clinical outcomes across a range of operations.
In addition, duration of operation is recorded routinely in
Spire Healthcare hospitals, and is not affected by loss of
patients to follow-up, unlike other measures of clinical out-
come such as hospital death. Duration of hospital stay (in
minutes) was investigated as a secondary outcome measure.
Statistical analysis
Operating times are zero-bound and present a skewed
distribution14. Therefore, all analyses focused on changes
in natural logarithmic operating time, which can be seen
as equivalent to measuring proportional time changes for
relatively small magnitudes. A model was created to cap-
ture the effects of absolute list order, procedure-specific
list order and switching acrosss the full range of list
positions to understand the relationship between list com-
position and duration of operation. It was also reasoned
that different operations might yield distinctly different
patterns of results, and so the analysis was conducted at a
procedure level to allow individual cases to be compared
against the same types of procedure.
As the data set included information on factors known to
correlate with postoperative outcomes (ASA grade5,
6,
41,
42
and age43–45), these potential confounders were controlled
for. Different ages and ASA grades, along with different
surgical procedures would imply different normal operat-
ing times; therefore, these baseline operating times were
treated as random effects, shared by all operations of the
same type, on the same age group and with the same ASA
grade. In reality, operations on patients in similar age
groups or with similar ASA grades will have similar base-
lines; for example, a 34-year-old patient with an ASA grade
of II is more similar to a 40-year-old with an ASA grade
of II than an 80-year-old with a grade of IV. However,
assumptions were not made about the relationship between
duration of operation and these factors. Instead, a statisti-
cally more conservative approach was adopted by assuming
that these random effects were independent between
pairs of operations (unless all 3 of these variables were
identical).

For a closer examination of the primary effects observed
in the data, a form of matched analysis was subsequently
performed on a subset of the data. This analysis was
inspired by (but not identical to) a novel method for iden-
tifying causal relationships in natural experiments47. Here,
the data were stratified into multiple sets of pairs by explic-
itly matching individuals who had the same age, ASA grade
and operation type, but differed in list order by one posi-
tion. Specifically, the data were first filtered by procedure
type, then all cases that were ordered as procedures 1 and
2 were separated into different data frames (list order 1
and list order 2). All cases in list order 1 (presented in a
randomly determined order) were examined to determine
which elements of list order 2 had the same age group
and ASA grade. If a case could be matched, this pair was
included in the subsequent analysis and removed from the
pool. In the event of multiple matches from list order 2 with
list order 1, the computer program randomly selected one
case for the pair and the non-selected case(s) were returned
to the pool for a possible future match. Each patient was
paired to only one other individual, and only patients for
whom a pair could be found were included. The match-
ing process terminated when no more unique pairs could
be found. This approach represents a method for statisti-
cally controlling for all the potential confounding variables
available in the data set.

repair (with mesh); b oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (with biopsy of lesion) and c lens implant for cataract. Error bars represent 95 per
cent confidence intervals
In addition to these primary analyses, it was determined
whether these effects translated across surgical method
(open and minimally invasive); and whether the impact of
list order varied according to procedure complexity. The
procedures were separated by classifying them as those
performed using open or minimally invasive techniques to
address the first question, and by complexity for the second
question, and the matched analysis repeated.
T
o provide a measure of the magnitude (or effect size)
of the analysed variables on list order, the change in the log
scale for the linear mixed-effects model was reported, along
with mean difference in the log duration of the procedures
in the matched analysis. Change in log duration is, to a
high degree of approximation, the geometric average of the
proportional percentage change in procedure duration; the
percentage change is therefore referred to for all outcomes
to provide an intuitive means of understanding these data.
Results
Surgical lists containing the 35 operations performed most
frequently between 1 April 2013 and 31 May 2015 were
analysed (255 757 procedures). The linear mixed-effects
model revealed statistically reliable differences in changes
in duration of operation for the fixed effects of abso-
lute list order, procedure-specific list order and switch-
ing when pooled across operations (all P < 0⋅001). The
effect sizes (which can be treated as percentage changes in
operating time as a function of list position change) were
largest for procedure-specific list order and switching. The
percentage change in duration of operation for each pro-
cedure is shown in Fig. 2.
For absolute list order, there was a statistically significant
list order effect, suggesting that each position in the list
decreases duration of operation by 0⋅39 (95 per cent c.i.
0⋅35 to 0⋅44) per cent across all operations. These effects
were substantially greater when considering the benefits
acrued when the same procedure was repeated in a list,
with the effect of procedure-specific list order leading to a
0⋅98 (0⋅88 to 1⋅09) per cent reduction in duration. There
was a cost associated with switching between different
procedures in a list, leading to an increase in duration
of operation by 6⋅48 (6⋅05 to 6⋅90) per cent for each
increase in position in list order. T
o illustrate this effect
on individual procedures, Fig. 3 shows the influence of task
repetition on operating time for three routine procedures.
There was a marked similarity in the pattern of results
across these procedures, indicating that fatigue, inattention
and monotony-related performance impairment following
multiple repetitions of a procedure were not present in
these data.
Using the same linear model to analyse duration of hospi-
tal stay, overall a statistically reliable effect of absolute and
procedure-specific list order was found (both P < 0⋅001),
but not for switching (P = 0⋅136). Specifically, the data indi-
cated that, for every increase in absolute list position, dura-
tion of hospital stay increased by 0⋅55 (95 per cent c.i. 0⋅50
to 0⋅61) per cent. However, procedure-specific list order
resulted in a decrease in length of stay by 0⋅72 (0⋅58 to 0⋅85)
per cent.

percentage change in duration of operation for
procedure-specific list order 2 procedures compared with list
order 1. Error bars represent 95 per cent confidence intervals.
Procedures are identified by AXA Specialist Procedure Codes
(Table S1, supporting information)
The matched analysis allowed a focus on the impact of
repeating a procedure in more detail on the primary out-
come measure of duration of operation. A total of 48 632
pairs were matched from of a maximum 48 699 cases (99⋅9
per cent of all cases; the sample size was constrained by the
number of cases with a procedure-specific list order of 2 in
the data set). Here, a statistically reliable improvement was
found (P < 0⋅050) in 29 of the 35 procedures; the change
in operating time ranged from a reduction of 3⋅84 (95 per
cent c.i. 1⋅47 to 6⋅21) per cent to 17⋅25 (10⋅69 to 23⋅81)
per cent (Fig. 4). Pooling across all 35 procedures showed a
6⋅18 (5⋅64 to 6⋅72) per cent reduction in operating time on
average when performing the second procedure relative to
the first (P < 0⋅001).
Supplementary analyses allowed these results to be
assessed in more detail. Conducting the matched analysis
separately for open and minimally invasive procedures
showed comparable effects of list order on duration of
operation, indicating that this phenomenon transcends
surgical method (Fig. 5a).
Finally, by separating procedures based on their complex-
ity, a weak positive trend was found, but overall there were
no differences in effect size as a function of complexity, with
the reduction in operating time ranging from 4⋅80 to 7⋅50
per cent (Fig. 5b).
Discussion
These results support the suggestion that areas where
surgical performance can be improved can be identified
through analysis of routinely collected large data sets. The
order in which surgical procedures are done has a rela-
tionship with their duration. The effects were similar for
open and minimally invasive procedures, and procedures of
differing complexity. In contrast, switching between differ-
ent procedures resulted in increased duration of operation.
These changes in operating time are particularly signifi-
cant given that they were observed in highly trained indi-
viduals with several years of practice. The results are all
the more remarkable when the wide range of factors that
can potentially influence procedure duration is considered.
The consistency of this pattern of results across procedure
type, method and complexity provides compelling evidence

 List order modulates duration of operation
1067
that operating list order plays an important role in surgical
performance.
The effects of list order on duration of hospital stay are
more difficult to interpret. A reduction in length of stay
demonstrated in some investigations, with an increase in
duration demonstrated in others, brings into question the
practical significance of these findings. They are likely to
reflect the complex, multifactorial nature of duration of
hospital stay, which is affected to a much greater degree by
social and institutional factors than operating time. Conse-
quently, efforts were focused on understanding the effects
of list order on duration of operation in the follow-up
matched analysis.
The data have practical implications. There was an over-
all 6⋅18 per cent saving in operating time (as large as 17⋅25
per cent in some procedures) for repeating the same pro-
cedure on the list, even after controlling for age and ASA
grade. This control is particularly important as anecdotal
evidence indicates that surgeons typically take these fac-
tors into account when compiling their lists, but the data
indicate that the process of list ordering itself influences
the duration of operation above and beyond the variance
captured by age and ASA grade.
From the perspective of service delivery, the results indi-
cate that lists involving a combination of procedures take
longer to complete than those that include only one pro-
cedure type (the overall cost of switching was estimated as
a 6⋅48 per cent increase in duration). Although increased
time with task switching has long been established in
experimental psychology48, this is the first demonstration
of its influence in surgical performance. Where possible,
theatre lists should be confined to a single procedure type
and method.
One limitation of the present analyses is that the data can-
not address the issue of the mechanisms of performance
facilitation. However, the results do triangulate with exist-
ing empirical work showing that warm up reduces operat-
ing times and task switching increases completion times25.
This indicates a need to explore these areas through further
research. An understanding of the optimal preparatory rou-
tines to drive performance improvement will be necessary
to harness the potential of the phenomenon reported here.
The present data were derived from a private healthcare
provider. It is worth noting that the majority of UK health-
care delivery is provided by the NHS, but the private sector
is used by 10–22 per cent of the population (depending
on region)49,
50. This data set was chosen for two reasons.
First, the data could be pooled across multiple hospitals
(a considerable logistical challenge in the NHS)51. Second,
all operations performed in private UK hospitals must
be conducted by trained consultant surgeons, eliminating
training effects and ensuring that all procedures on a the-
atre list were performed by a single practitioner. Further
work is required to establish whether these effects also
exist in the NHS, where surgeons performing the proce-
dures vary in experience. Environmental factors such as
distractions, ward rounds and general resource constraints
and prioritization also differ between private and NHS
hospitals.
The effects reported here are modest. Yet, it is evident
that the aggregation of even small gains has the poten-
tial to produce substantial benefits when scaled across
a health service; this is particularly important given the
growing economic pressures to optimize elective surgery10.
Although the full extent of the impact of these effects
remains to be seen, to put the present results in context,
52 per cent of the procedures analysed involved switch-
ing from the preceding operation, and the present results
demonstrate that switching is responsible for a 6⋅48 per
cent increase in duration of operation. Over the course of
a year in a typical large hospital, avoiding switching could
lead to a meaningful reduction in operating time.

Editor’
s comments
Surgeons tend to be responsible for choosing the order of procedures on an operating list. They vary, but some
like a range of different procedures on each list. This study provides good evidence that doing similar procedures
consecutively can be more efficient, particularly if a change of equipment is required, for example between open and
laparoscopic surgery. It should be acknowledged that the benefits are only a few minutes here and there, but they can
add up over time. Efficient use of theatre time is the responsibility of every surgeon, and a bit of thought about list
composition is appropriate. Finally, this paper is an example of worthwhile research that can be done using data from
non-public hospitals.
