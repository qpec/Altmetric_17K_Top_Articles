After Medicaid Expansion In
Kentucky, Use Of Hospital
Emergency Departments For
Dental Conditions Increased
ABSTRACT Access to oral health care is a critical need for the adult
Medicaid population. Following the 2014 expansion of Medicaid
eligibility in Kentucky, millions of adults became eligible to receive dental
benefits. We examined the impact of the expansion on adult Medicaid
enrollees’ use of hospital emergency departments (EDs) for conditions
related to dental or oral health in the period 2010–14. Based on our
analysis of data for Kentucky from the State Emergency Department
Databases, we found that the rate of discharges for these conditions from
the ED increased significantly, from 1,833 per 100,000 population in 2013
to 5,635 in 2014. Adults covered by Medicaid who used the ED for
treatment of oral health conditions in 2014 had high levels of chronic
comorbidities and were more likely to be male and nonwhite than those
in earlier years. To avoid costly and inappropriate use of the ED, states
considering adding an adult Medicaid dental benefit should consider also
making changes to assist beneficiaries in obtaining access to the dental
health care delivery system.
P
roviding oral health care to all
Americans is a growing challenge—
especially with the aging popula-
tion and in the case of low-income
people and underserved minority
groups.1 In addition, clinicians, researchers,
and policy makers are being called on to identify
opportunities to improve the value and efficien-
cy of the health care system.
For a growing number of Americans, the hos-
pital emergency department (ED) has become
the first site of treatment for dental needs, with
estimated annual costs to the US health care
system of $1.6 billion.2 In 2009 an estimated
130 million Americans were without dental cov-
erage.3 EDs have become the safety net for those
who cannot otherwise obtain dental care or who
have inadequate commercial or public dental
care coverage. Dental care received in the ED
is usually palliative in nature: Patients receive
prescriptions for analgesics (usually opioids),
antibiotics, or both for the treatment of symp-
toms such as pain or toothache and infection.4
The increasing use of EDs for routine dental care
or treatment of preventable conditions that
should instead be provided in a dentist’s office
is an escalating public health concern across the
United States.5–8
Kentucky has some of the nation’s poorest oral
health outcomes across age groups, particularly
among low-income adults.9,10 One in five low-in-
come adults there say that their mouth and teeth
are in poor condition and that they are likely to
experience pain as a result.11 Yet low-income
adults do not necessarily seek care in a dentist’s
office: 23 percent cite inconvenient location or
time as a reason to avoid going to the dentist.11
Among the states that expanded eligibility for
Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA),
Kentucky is unique because of its remarkable
and well-documented success at enrolling newly
eligible adults in Medicaid.12–16 In fact, enroll-

 ment increased much more rapidly than ex-
pected: 440,000 people enrolled after Kentucky
expanded Medicaid eligibility on January 1,
2014, whereas only 188,000 new beneficiaries
had been projected to enroll by 2021.17 This ex-
pansion and the increased costs associated with
it are the focus of a section 1115 waiver that the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
(CMS) has tentatively approved, which will re-
sult in dramatic restrictions to the Kentucky
Medicaid program.18,19
The Medicaid expansion in Kentucky signifi-
cantly increased access to primary care among
low-income
adults,13–16
significantly
reduced
their inability to pay for medications and medical
care,13–16 and improved self-reported health sta-
tus and increased the number of preventive care
visits among low-income adults.14 These effects
were larger in 2015 than in 2014.13,14
Under the ACA, oral health is considered an
essential benefit only for children, and Kentucky
is one of just twelve states that chose to provide
dental coverage for adults as part of its Medicaid
expansion.20 The added dental benefits are lim-
ited: They include some diagnostic, preventive,
and minor restorative services and have a per
person annual cap of $1,000.10,21 This expansion
has resulted in hundreds of thousands of adults
receiving dental coverage, and Medicaid visits to
dental offices increased by 31 percent between
2014 and 2015.22 This is especially important
because dental coverage was not part of Medic-
aid for adults in Kentucky before the expansion,
which means thatmany adults havenewly gained
access to dental care. Recent evidence from add-
ing a vision benefit to Medicaid suggests that
the dental benefit may lead to improved health
outcomes.10,23
While there is agreement on the positive ef-
fects of Medicaid expansion,13–16 findings about
changes in ED visits associated with that expan-
sion have been inconsistent. A study of Oregon’s
limited expansion lottery in 2008 found in-
creased overall use of the ED that may have been
caused by the reduced costs of ED visits and a
lack of familiarity with primary care options.24
However, other research using the national ED
database25 and information for California, Flor-
ida, and New York from the State Emergency
Department Databases26 found reduced ED visits
after expansion. Survey results in Kentucky also
showed reduced use of the ED.14
Little research has been conducted to under-
stand the impact of ED visits for dental condi-
tions on states that added dental coverage. How-
ever, in pioneering research, Astha Singhal and
coauthors found that the elimination of compre-
hensive adult dental coverage through Medicaid
in California led to an immediate and significant
increase in dental ED visits.5 This policy change
disproportionately affected young adults, non-
whites, and urban residents, resulting in in-
creased yearly costs for Medicaid because of
the ED visits.
The evidence from California might suggest
that adding even limited dental coverage should
reduce dental ED visits among adults enrolled in
Medicaid, as previously uninsured adults gain
access to preventive dental care to some de-
gree.5,14 However, expanding dental coverage
does not automatically guarantee increased ac-
cess to dental care. A sudden influx of new pa-
tients may overwhelm the dental care system,
making it impossible to meet demand.10,20,22
According to the American Dental Associa-
tion’s Health Policy Institute, the Kentucky Med-
icaid program’s fee-for-service reimbursement
was just 44 percent of private dental benefit
plans’ reimbursement for children’s dental ser-
vices in 2013, and only 39 percent of dentists in
the state provided children’s dental services
through Medicaid in 2014.27 Providers’ incen-
tives to accept Medicaid patients are limited by
low reimbursement rates, excessive paperwork,
and patients’ poor appointment-keeping abili-
ties and low oral health literacy.28 The new Med-
icaid beneficiary population may also have little
experience in seeking dental care in dental offic-
es and may be more familiar with using the ED
for emergency conditions.22,24 While dental case
management programs may reduce these bar-
riers, few case management programs exist for
Medicaid patients.28
We examined the impact of Medicaid expan-
sion on the use of ED visits by adult enrollees
for conditions related to dental or oral health
in Kentucky, 2010–14. We identified trends as
well as specific factors (race, sex, location, and
comorbidities) that were significantly associated
with a visit to the ED for dental care.
Study Data And Methods
Data Sources Weused data fromthe StateEmer-
gency Department Databases of the Healthcare
Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) to capture
discharge information
on
all
ED
visits
in
Kentucky in the period 2010–14 that did not re-
sult in a hospital admission for adults older than
age twenty-one. If Medicaid was listed as the
primary payer for the discharge, we interpreted
that to mean that Medicaid paid for the dis-
charge. Rates of ED discharges for conditions
related to dental and oral health per 100,000
Medicaid-eligible adults were calculated using
Medicaid statistics from the Kentucky Cabinet
for Health and Family Services.29 These statistics

 aggregated analysis of race or ethnicity was not
possible.
County-level information on the number of
dentists and median household income came
from the Area Health Resources Files. Cost-to-
charge ratios from HCUP and the Common-
wealth of Kentucky30 were used to estimate the
costs of ED discharges. These ratios reflected
inpatientcosts instead of outpatient ordischarge
data, but they were the best tool available for
estimating the actual costs of ED visits.
Variables Conditions related to dental or oral
health are defined as conditions with Internation-
al Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clin-
ical Modification (ICD-9-CM), diagnosis codes
of 520.0–529.9.31 In data from the State Emer-
gency Department Databases, there is no indica-
tor of the primary or secondary diagnosis; in-
stead, each discharge is associated with a list
of up to twenty-five diagnoses. Only the first five
listed ICD-9-CM diagnosis codes for dental con-
ditions were used to create the diagnosis varia-
bles in the analysis. For a complete discussion
of this issue and a statistical power analysis that
indicated no loss of statistical power as a result of
this decision, see online Appendix Exhibit A1.32
The variables indicating the preventability and
severity of conditions related to dental or oral
health were created using a schema that classi-
fied ICD-9-CM dental diagnosis codes based on
the severity of the condition and the likelihood
that the conditions were preventable through
normal dental care (that is, had the person re-
ceived a filling on the tooth, the likelihood that
the decay would not have progressed to the pulp
and caused an abscess and pain).33 In this analy-
sis, we focused on preventable, low-severity con-
ditions, as those may be most responsive to in-
tervention and diversion from the ED.
Methods In our descriptive analyses, we used
chi-square and analysis of variation tests to
compare time trends (for a more complete de-
scription of these methods, see Appendix Exhib-
it A2).32 In our multivariate analysis, we estimat-
ed a fixed-effects logistic regression model that
compared discharges for conditions related to
dental or oral health and other discharges in
the adult Medicaid population.
The relatively rareoccurrence of discharges for
conditions related to dental or oral health in the
full sample, compared to medical discharges,
necessitated the use of a rare-event correction
to ensure accurate predictions. The rare-event
correction was performed by randomly selecting
a 5 percent subsample of discharges that were
not for conditions related to dental or oral health
to create a balanced sample, and then correcting
for the resulting sample selection bias.34
Two logistic regression models were estimat-
ed. The first was estimated on the pooled data set
for the period 2010–13 and included indicator
variables for each year to create a fixed-effects
model. Thus, the model controlled for the effect
of time and produced estimates that showed
year-over-year averages. The second regression
was estimated on the data for 2014 alone. Equal-
ity of coefficient tests were used to determine if
the coefficients in the first and second regression
models differed significantly. To test for moder-
ating effects, interaction terms among sex, age,
and race (both two-way and three-way inter-
actions) and between race and income, race and
location, and the rate of dentists in the popula-
tion and location were examined and included in
the model ifsignificant. The goodnessof fit of the
logistic regression models to the data are de-
scribed in Appendix Exhibit A2.32
Limitations Our study was subject to some
limitations. First, it was difficult to determine
whether the observed effects were due to the
immediate release of a pent-up demand for care,
or whether they were associated with longer-
term trends. The available evidence supports
the former explanation, as the largest increase
in admissions for conditions related to dental or
oral health occurred in the quarter-year immedi-
ately following the expansion (Appendix Exhib-
it A3).32 However, data from 2015, which are not
yet available, would be needed to determine this
with more certainty.
Second, dental ED visits present an incom-
plete picture of the impact of dental coverage
expansion. We could not measure other aspects
of the expansion, such as an increase in visits to
dental offices in Kentucky. If anything, our anal-
ysis underestimated the cost borne by Medicaid
during the expansion.
Third, our study design was observational, in-
stead of quasi-experimental or experimental.
Designs that allow for making causal inferences,
such as an interrupted time-series design or pro-
pensity score matching design, were inappropri-
ate in our analytical context because of the roll-
ing nature of Medicaid expansion enrollments in
Kentucky and the absence of complete informa-
tion on the characteristics of the people dis-
charged from the ED.5 We attempted to minimize
the influence of confounding factors, such as
population changes and the secular increase in
ED discharges for conditions related to dental
or oral health,2 by calculating rates of ED dis-
charges for conditions related to dental and oral
health in the population and determining trends
in the several years before expansion.
Despite these limitations, we are confident
that the expansion in adult Medicaid enrollment
was directly tied to the dramatic changes de-
scribed below.

 Study Results
The percentage of adult Medicaid discharges for
conditions related to dental or oral health in
Kentucky increased markedly, from 18 percent
in 2013 to 50 percent in 2014, and the percentage
of discharges for those conditions covered by
private insurance increased slightly over time
(Exhibit 1). At the same time, the percentage
of the discharges for the uninsured decreased
dramatically, from 57 percent in 2013 to 21 per-
cent in 2014 (for the results of statistical tests,
see Appendix Exhibit A4).32
Similarly, costs to Medicaid for discharges for
conditions related to dental or oral health among
adults increased markedly from 2013 to 2014
(Exhibit 1). For the period 2010–13, the majority
of these costs were incurred by the uninsured.
From 2010 to 2014, costs for all payers, adjusted
for inflation, increased by 17 percent—from
$11.6 million to $13.6 million. During the same
period, costs for Medicaid, adjusted for infla-
tion, increased by 194 percent. The percentage
of the amount charged to Medicaid that was re-
imbursed decreased from 38 percent in 2010 to
34 percent in 2014 (Appendix Exhibit A5).32
Discharges from the ED for conditions related
to dental or oral health decreased from 8,341 in
2010 to 6,328 in 2013 (Exhibit 2). The propor-
tion of all discharges for those conditions also
decreased during this period, from 3.3 percent to
2.7 percent (Appendix Exhibit A6).32 This de-
crease mirrored a general decrease in the num-
ber and rate of ED visits for any reason among
adults enrolled in Medicaid during this period
(Appendix Exhibit A6).32
In 2014, as Medicaid coverage for the adult
population expanded, the number of ED dis-
charges for conditions related to dental or
oral health jumped dramatically, to 18,884
(Exhibit 2). The rate of those discharges also
increased markedly. While ED discharges for
any reason among adults enrolled in Medicaid
doubled from 2013 to 2014, the number of dis-
charges for conditions related to dental or oral
health nearly tripled and became a larger pro-
portion of all ED discharges (Appendix Exhib-
it A6).32 Moreover, the average cost per dis-
charge increased significantly over time, over
and above the cost of inflation (Exhibit 2).
When we stratified the common diagnoses for
conditions related to dental or oral health by
preventability and severity, we found that diag-
noses for dental caries became less common over
time in ED discharges, while diagnoses for ab-
scesses became more frequent (Appendix Exhib-
it A6).32 The proportion of discharges for condi-

 tions related to dental or oral health that could be
classified as preventable with primary dental
care rose from 22 percent in 2010 to 33 percent
in 2014, while the proportion of diagnoses for
these conditions that were considered to be of
low severity decreased from 48 percent to 38 per-
cent (Appendix Exhibit A7).32
The most common chronic comorbidities as-
sociated with a diagnosis of a condition related
to dental or oral health included tobacco use,
hypertension, diabetes, and asthma, and their
proportions are presented in Appendix Exhib-
it A8.32 The share of Medicaid enrollees dis-
charged for a condition related to dental or oral
health who also had a chronic comorbid condi-
tion increased significantly over time, from
41 percent in 2010 to 51 percent in 2014. The
proportion of those with multiple chronic co-
morbid conditions also increased over time,
from 12 percent to 18 percent.
In the period 2010–13, women had significant-
ly higher rates of discharges for conditions relat-
ed to dental or oral health, compared to men
(Exhibit 3). In 2014, however, after the Medicaid
expansion, men had significantly more dis-
charges than women did. Across all years, the
majority of discharges for conditions related to
dental or oral health occurred among women
(Appendix Exhibit A9).32 Also across all years,
nonwhites had higher numbers of such dis-
charges than whites did, with the difference be-
coming very large in 2014 (Exhibit 3). In the
study period, whites accounted for 85–89 per-
cent of all discharges for these conditions (Ap-
pendix Exhibit A9).32
The pattern for age groups was similar across
time, for both sexes, and for whites and non-
whites (Appendix Exhibit A9).32 Rates of dis-
charges for conditions related to dental or oral
health were highest among people ages 21–34,
significantly lower for those ages 35–54, and
lowest of all for those ages 55 and older. These
differences between age groups were large, with
the majority of discharges occurring among the
youngest group (Appendix Exhibit A9).32
When we controlled for all of the variables in
the regression model that compared adult Med-
icaid enrollees discharged for conditions related
to dental or oral health and those discharged
withotherdiagnoses,wefoundthatmenages21–
34 had the highest predicted probability of being
discharged with a condition related to dental or
oral health, compared to being discharged for
another diagnosis (Exhibit 4). Women ages 21–
34 had the second-highest probability, and men
had higher probabilities than women for all age
groups—except for those ages 55 and older in
2014, when the probabilities for men and women
were the same. The coefficients and predicted
probabilities for each sex by age group were sig-
nificantly larger in 2014 than they were in 2010–
13 (Appendix Exhibit A10).32 Thus, the probabil-
ity of being diagnosed with a condition related to
dental or oral health was significantly higher in
2014 than in earlier years.
The interaction between race and location
showed that in suburban and in medium and
small metropolitan areas, whites had higher pre-
dicted probabilities than nonwhites of being
discharged for a condition related to dental or
oral health, while in rural areas nonwhites had
higher
predicted
probabilities
than
whites
(Exhibit 4). The highest predicted probabilities
were among people living in suburbs, and the
lowest were among those in large central metro-
politan areas. The probability of being diagnosed
with a condition related to dental or oral health
was significantly higher in 2014 than earlier
years, regardless of race or location (Appendix
Exhibit A10).32 Finally, across all years, people in
the bottom two income quartiles were signifi-

Discussion
The Medicaid expansion in Kentucky under the
ACA began January 1, 2014, and included limited
dental coverage for adults. Following the expan-
sion, therewas a significant increase in use of the
ED forcarerelated to dental and oral health, with
more than 12,500 additional discharges for that
care in 2014, compared to 2013. The increase
happened immediately after the program expan-
sion, and associated costs to Medicaid more than
tripled from 2013 to 2014. The increased rates of
discharges for conditions related to dental or
oral health weregreater amongmenthanwomen
and among whites than nonwhites. Across all
years, people in the two lower quartiles of in-
come were more likely than those in the highest
quartile to have an ED discharge for dental care.
These results indicate that as Medicaid ex-
panded to serve previously uninsured individu-
als, the program reached a population in poorer
oral and general health that was more likely to
visit the ED for unmet dental needs—many
preventable—compared to previously covered
beneficiaries. Evidence suggests that the in-
crease in ED discharges for conditions related
to dental or oral health may be temporary, as the
largest increase in visits occurred immediately
after the expansion in early 2014, and reductions
in ED visits for all conditions were seen among
low-income Kentuckians in 2015.14,35
We cannot rule out the possibility that im-
proved education outreach for new Medicaid en-
rollees regarding access to the dental care deliv-
ery system could have assisted them in finding
care from dentists instead of in the ED. Kentucky
had in place an extensive outreach program that
included a website36 and trained community ser-
vice agents (called kynectors) to help adults un-
derstand their overall Medicaid benefits and pri-
mary care options.18 However, we could not find
evidence that such outreach efforts were in place
to help adults understand their dental coverage.
In addition to improving Medicaid enrollees’
knowledge of their benefits, investments must
be made to increase the number of dentists who
participate in Medicaid. It has been reported that
Kentucky Medicaid enrollees face challenges to
using their benefits to access dental services.22,37
The number of dentists in Kentucky and their
rate per 100,000 population increased from
2010 to 2014 (from 2,412 to 2,733 and from

 33.75 per 100,000 population to 37.20), but few-
er than half of them participate in Medicaid for
children.27 Lower reimbursement rates for Med-
icaid fee-for-service claims compared to private
dental benefit plans,27,38 high no-show rates for
appointments by Medicaid enrollees, and the
administrative burden of participating in the
program10,28,39 may contribute to the problem.
A solution that has proved to be effective in
North Carolina among pediatric Medicaid pa-
tients is training primary care providers to pro-
vide oral health screenings, risk assessments,
and basic preventive care to pediatric Medicaid
patients.40 Doing likewise could maximize the
success of Kentucky’s Medicaid expansion by
increasing low-income adults’ access to primary
care,13–16 including to preventive dental care out-
side of a dentist’s office.14 In other states, com-
munity partnerships among businesses, dental
offices, and Medicaid beneficiaries have proved
effective at reducing costs and ED visits.41
Gov. Matt Bevin applied for a section 1115
waiver to eliminate Kentucky’s Medicaid dental
coverage for adults and add work requirements,
premiums with penalties for nonpayment, and
other cost-saving measures to the state’s Medic-
aid program.18,19,42 CMS has tentatively approved
the waiver, as noted above, and the governor has
indicated that if the application is denied, he will
roll back all Medicaid expansion provisions.18,19
Based on the California experience discussed
above,5 eliminating comprehensive adult dental
coverage in Kentucky would lead to additional
immediate and significant increases in dental ED
visits, which in turn would result in higher yearly
costs for Medicaid. Given the overall poor oral
health of the population of Kentucky and the
increase in dental health that these Medicaid
dental benefits may cause, the proposed waiver
changes raise many concerns. Fourteen percent

 of all public comments on the waiver were relat-
ed to dental and vision benefits.10,11,23,43
Our research contributes to the debate about
the impact of Medicaid expansion on ED use.
Our findings are in line with some previous stud-
ies, which found that Medicaid expansion causes
increasedED use.24 Ourfindingsalsosupport the
theory that this increased use is the result of
pent-up demand for services that cannot be easi-
ly met by existing systems and of a lack of famil-
iarity with more appropriate preventive or treat-
ment options. In situations in which consumer
education is comprehensive and capacity is suf-
ficient, the use of the ED and safety-net clinics
decreases with Medicaid expansion.14,44
Conclusion
Kentucky’s experience provides evidence that
offering adult dental benefits in Medicaid ad-
dresses a critical need for tens of thousands of
people. In Kentucky the use of hospitals’ EDs for
dental conditions increased significantly after
expansion of the state’s Medicaid program. This
increased use likely stems from the extensive
unmet needs and difficulty in navigating the
health care system with respect to dental care.
Also, these new Medicaid beneficiaries likely had
elevated health care costs, compared to others
who had had continuous access to coverage (ei-
ther public or private). Solutions for the increase
in ED discharges for dental or oral health con-
ditions are multifactorial and require systems
changes that encourage dentists’ participation
in Medicaid, an increase in the program’s fee-
for-service reimbursements, and assistance for
beneficiaries in navigating the dental health care
delivery system.38
States considering adding an adult dental ben-
efit to their Medicaid programs should antici-
pate at least some initial increase in the use of
the ED fordentalcare andshouldsimultaneously
implement programs that effectively redirect pa-
tients to dental offices. Together with a focus on
oral health education and prevention in state
policy, transportation support to help patients
get to dental appointments, and integrating oral
health screening and referrals into primary care,
these strategies can ensure the most appropriate
use of that dental benefit. Collectively, these
strategies focus on improving the patient’s oral
health status and, therefore, achieving the Triple
Aim of better health outcomes, lower costs, and
better patient experience. ▪
