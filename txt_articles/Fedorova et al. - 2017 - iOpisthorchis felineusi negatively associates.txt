Abstract 
Background: Most studies on the relationship between helminth infections and atopic disorders 
have been conducted in (sub)tropical developing countries where exposure to multiple parasites and 
lifestyle can confound the relationship. We aimed to study the relationship between infection with 
the fish-borne helminth Opishorchis felineus and specific IgE, skin prick testing and atopic symptoms 
in Western-Siberia, with lifestyle and hygiene standards of a developed country.  
 
Methods: Schoolchildren aged 7 to 11 years were sampled from one urban and two rural regions. 
Skin prick tests (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) against food and aeroallergens were measured and data 
on allergic symptoms and on demographic and socio-economic factors were collected by 
questionnaire. Diagnosis of opisthorchiasis was based on PCR performed on stool samples. 
Results: Of the 732 children included, 34.9% had opisthorchiasis. The sensitisation to any allergen 
when estimated by positive SPT was 12.8%, while much higher, 24.0%, when measured by sIgE. 
Atopic symptoms in the past year (flexural eczema and/or rhinoconjunctivitis) were reported in 
12.4% of the children. SPT was positively related to flexural eczema and rhinoconjunctivitis, but not 
to wheezing. Opisthorchiasis showed association with lower SPT response, as well as borderline 
association with low IgE reactivity to any allergen. However, the effect of opisthorchiasis on SPT 
response was not mediated by IgE, suggesting that opisthorchiasis influences SPT response through 
another mechanism. Opisthorchiasis also showed borderline association with lower atopic 
symptoms.

INTRODUCTION 
 
The prevalence of skin test reactivity and allergic diseases is higher in developed than in developing 
countries (1, 2) and within the same country, higher in urban than in rural area (3-6). Some of these 
observations might be explained by differences in exposure to environmental factors, like parasites. 
Helminth infections are associated with induction of Th2 responses and high levels of IgE. However

high levels of allergen specific IgE do not trigger SPT, as the IgE seems to be directed at carbohydrate 
moieties and of poor biological activity (7). Therefore the epidemiological studies of the association 
between helminths and allergies focus on SPT and reported symptoms as allergic outcomes. The 
association between helminths and SPT and allergic diseases has been studied with majority 
showing negative association for SPT and inconsistent results for symptoms (8). However, most 
studies were conducted in (sub)tropical regions where infection with multiple worms is common, 
and where lifestyle can be a confounding factor (9, 10). Therefore it is often difficult to dissect the 
association between allergies and parasites from the complex interplay of other environmental, 
socio-economic, and demographic influences.  
Infection with the liver flukes of the family Opisthorchiidae has not been investigated in detail in the 
context of allergies. It is estimated that in European and Asian countries 17 million people are 
infected, of which at least 1.6 million with Opisthorchis felineus, the most common cause of 
opisthorchiasis in Russia and Europe (11). The life cycle of O. felineus includes freshwater snails as 
intermediate hosts, and freshwater fish as second intermediate host. People acquire the infection 
through eating raw or undercooked fish. Other final definitive hosts of this helminth can be 
carnivorous animals, like cats and dogs, that serve as reservoirs of infection (12, 13).   
One of the areas in Russia with a high prevalence of O. felineus is Western Siberia. This region has 
the lifestyle and climate of a developed country, compared to (sub)tropical areas in developing 
countries, where multitude of helminth infections are usually highly prevalent. Therefore, this area 
provides a unique opportunity to address the question of whether helminth infections, within a 
more western lifestyle and therefore not confounded by factors present in endemic developing 
countries, are associated with atopic disorders. 
Here, we examined the association of chronic O. felineus infection with skin prick tests (SPT) and IgE 
reactivity against food and aeroallergens and self-reported atopic symptoms in schoolchildren from 
three areas of Western Siberia.

METHODS 
 
Study population and design 
The study was part of the EuroPrevall project, a large EU-funded project on food allergy across 
Europe (14), and across Ghana (7) and China, India and Russia (EuroPrevall-International 
Cooperation (INCO)) as described before (15).  
Participants were sampled from three areas of the Tomsk Oblast (Western Siberia, Russia, Figure 1): 
Tomsk city as urban area, and two rural regions with low or high reported prevalence of clinical 
disease of opisthorchiasis. Tomsk city (TC) is the capital of the Tomsk Oblast and it has a typical 
western lifestyle, with high degree of scientific and technical development. The rural region with low 
prevalence of opisthorchiasis (RL) is located around Tomsk city. Agriculture and forestry are well-
developed industries in this region. The rural region with high prevalence of opisthorchiasis (RH) is 
located on the River Ob where fishing is the major occupation and river fish is a traditional food. 
Official medical statistics (2009) show that  the incidence of clinical disease of opisthorchiasis is 
about 40, 44 and 109 new cases per 1,000 children per year, in respectively TC, RL and RH. These 
statistics are based on a unified system of official reports about treatment and diagnosis of patients 
for all clinics and hospitals of the Russian Federation. Diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms and 
the presence of eggs in stool samples (by microscopy) and/or presence of eggs or adult parasites in 
bile after duodenal intubation.  
Our study design has multiple stages and starts with a cross-sectional survey of the general 
population (Figure 2), where children  aged  7 to 11 years old were screened for self-reported 
adverse reactions to foods. Short standardized screening questionnaires (SQ, in Supplement) were 
distributed through schools and were completed by a parent or guardian. An extended case-control 
questionnaire (CCQ) included questions on allergic symptoms, and potential risks and exposures. A

trained interviewer administered the CCQ to a parent or guardian in a subsample of the children. 
Skin-prick testing (SPT) and blood collection for serum specific IgE measurements was performed in 
all children with CCQ data (15). Of these 1,288 children, 732 gave a stool sample to determine the 
presence of Opisthorchis felineus.  
The study was approved by the Siberian State Medical University Local Ethics Committee, Health 
Care Department, and Educational Department of the Tomsk Oblast Government. All parents or 
guardians of the children gave informed consent.  
 
Skin prick testing 
Skin prick tests (SPT) were done with reagents kindly provided by ALK-Abelló (Madrid, Spain), 
comprising 13 foods and 9 inhalants (Supplementary Table S1) (15). Tests were performed according 
to EAACI guidelines (16). Histamine (10 mg/ml) and saline were used as positive and negative 
controls, respectively. Valid and comparable results were obtained by carefully training three 
allergists to perform tests in the same way. Skin prick tests were considered positive if the mean 
wheal diameter was equal to or greater than 3 mm. We used SPT sensitisation to any allergen as 
composite outcome, which was defined as having at least one positive SPT to one of the foods or 
inhalant allergen sources.  
Specific IgE 
Specific IgE (sIgE) in serum was determined on an ImmunoCAP 250 System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Uppsala, Sweden) to 24 food allergens and to 6 inhalants (Supplementary Table S1). Sera were first 
tested on 5 food mixtures (15) and positive samples were then tested against the individual foods of 
that mix. Specific IgE sensitisation to any allergen was defined by positive serology to at least one of 
the foods or inhalant allergen sources. sIgE results were considered positive when we detected 
levels of  ≥ 0.35 kUA/L.

Atopic symptoms 
We used data from the case-control questionnaire to define self-reported symptoms in the past 12 
months: wheezing (wheezing or whistling in the chest), rhinoconjunctivitis (problem with sneezing, 
or a runny, or a blocked nose without a cold or the flu, accompanied by itchy-watery eyes), and 
flexural eczema (itchy rash which was coming and going for at least 6 months, affecting any of the 
following places: the folds of the elbows, behind the knees, in front of the ankles, or around the 
neck, ears, or eyes). Symptoms associated to any SPT were combined in the composite outcome for 
atopic symptoms, which were rhinoconjunctivitis and flexural eczema and not wheezing.  
 
Opisthorchis felineus – DNA isolation and real-time PCR 
Diagnosis of opisthorchiasis was determined with real-time PCR on DNA of stool samples, performed 
at the Leiden University Medical Centre (the Netherlands).  
Details are described in the additional Methods information in the Supplement. Ct values were used 
to determine the intensity of infection with arbitrary cut-offs: low/moderate infection if Ct ≥ 30; and 
high infection if Ct < 30 (17). For analysis with the binary variable for opisthorchiasis, children with 
low/moderate and high DNA load are grouped together indicating infection with O. felineus. 
 
Statistical analyses  
Sampling weights were used to correct the analyses for the oversampling of children with adverse 
reactions to foods (Figure 2) (18, 19). The chance of participating in the study was predicted for each 
stage of the study design, and inverse probabilities were used to calculate non-response weights for 
each child. Final weighting factors incorporated design weights (inverse of the sampling fraction) and

two non-response weights (Supplementary Figure S1) corresponding to non-response to stage 2 - 
case control questionnaire and stage 3 - stool sample collection (Figure 2).  
χ2-tests and logistic regression were used to analyse the data, guided by a conceptual framework 
(Figure 3). This framework shows the relations between Opisthorchis felineus, SPT, sIgE, and atopic 
symptoms. The association of O. felineus infection with sIgE and SPT to food and aeroallergens and 
atopic symptoms was investigated. To increase statistical efficiency (20), three composite outcomes 
were used in the main analyses: SPT and sIgE to any allergen (food and/or aero), and any atopic 
symptom in the past 12 months, which included flexural eczema and/or rhinoconjunctivitis. Main 
multivariate analyses of these associations used a priori adjustment for area, age and gender. As 
sensitivity analyses, we added to the models additional variables associated with sIgE, SPT and 
atopic symptoms in univariate analyses (P < 0.05). We tested for heterogeneity of odds ratios across 
study areas by adding interaction terms into the models. A P-value below 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0 
(Armonk, NY: IBM Corp) and STATA 11 software (StataCorp. 2009. Stata Statistical Software: Release 
11. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).  
 
RESULTS 
Study characteristics 
A total of 732 children from the 3 areas participated in this study: 270 from Tomsk city (TC), 202 
from the rural region with low prevalence of opisthorchiasis (RL) and 260 from the rural region with 
high prevalence of opisthorchiasis (RH) (Figure 2). Opisthorchiasis was found in 34.9% of the children 
and differed significantly among the three areas. The prevalence and intensity of opisthorchiasis 
infection were highest in RH and lowest in TC (Table 1).

All children with a negative SPT reaction (< 3 mm) to histamine (n = 137) were excluded from the SPT 
analysis. Histamine negativity occurred more frequently in the group of SPT-negative children 
compared to the SPT-positives to any allergen (20.3% vs. 10.3%, P = 0.012), in sIgE-negative children 
(to aero allergens) (20.7% vs. 11.9, P = 0.015) and in children from RL (25.7% vs. 14.1% in TC and 
18.1% in RH, P = 0.042) (Supplementary Table S2). Histamine negatives were less likely to have 
mothers with university level (14.6%), compared to secondary (20.0%) or less than secondary 
education (25.5%), although statistical significance was borderline (P = 0.052). Important to note 
that three people performed all SPTs, but the percentage of children with a negative histamine 
reaction did not differ among them (19.5%, 16.8% and 18.2%, P = 0.702).  
Of the remaining 595 children, 12.8% had a positive SPT response to at least one of the food (3.3%) 
or aero allergens tested (11.7%) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The prevalence of allergic 
symptoms in the past 12 months was 12.4% (7.4% for rhinoconjunctivitis and 5.9% for flexural 
eczema). 
For 29 of the 732 children, sIgE could not be measured due to either refusal to donate blood or 
insufficient volume of serum. Of them, 24 children had reliable SPT data, so 571 children had data on 
both SPT and sIgE. All 29 children came from the rural regions (17 from RL, 12 from RH), but 
differences in opisthorchiasis and other variables were not observed between children with and 
without data on sIgE (data not shown). Of the 703 children with sIgE data, 24.0% had a positive sIgE 
to either one of the food (13.0%) or aero allergens (19.6%) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1).  
 
Association between sIgE, SPT and symptoms 
Specific IgE and SPT to food, aero and any allergen were associated strongly and significantly 
(Supplementary Table S3). Of the three self-reported symptoms in the past 12 months, 
rhinoconjunctivitis and flexural eczema, but not wheezing, were significantly associated to SPT to

any allergen. SPT reactivity among the symptomatic children was 43.5% for rhinoconjunctivitis, 
33.8% for flexural eczema and 13.9% for wheezing. Therefore, the composite outcome for atopic 
symptoms in the past 12 months combined only rhinoconjunctivitis and flexural eczema. 
 
Factors associated with opisthorchiasis and outcomes 
Univariate associations of each demographic and socio-economic factor with opisthorchiasis and 
outcomes are presented in Table 2 (composite outcomes: SPT and sIgE to any allergen, atopic 
symptoms), Supplementary Table S4 (SPT and sIgE to food and aero allergens) and Table S5 
(wheezing, rhinoconjunctivitis, flexural eczema). The rural areas, (less than) secondary education, 
overcrowding, past cat/dog ownership and current cat/dog ownership were positively associated 
with O. felineus infection.  
Negative associations were found between female gender, low maternal education and sIgE to any 
allergen, between RL area, overcrowding, past and current cat/dog ownership and SPT to any 
allergen, and between RH area, (less than) secondary maternal education and atopic symptoms (P < 
0.05, Table 2). 
 
Opisthorchiasis and IgE  
Total IgE levels were not significantly different between children with or without opisthorchiasis 
(Geometric Mean (GM) = 41.9 IU/mL, CI = 10.0–166.5 and GM = 49.3, CI = 11.4–203.2, P = 0.326, 
with a priori adjustment for area, age and gender). Opisthorchiasis was not significantly associated 
with sIgE to allergens, although there was a negative trend (any allergen: OR = 0.62, CI = 0.37–1.05, P 
= 0.078, with a priori adjustment, Table 3).

Opisthorchiasis and SPT  
The presence of O. felineus was significantly associated with less SPT reactivity (OR = 0.47, CI = 0.23–
0.94, P = 0.034, with a priori adjustment, Table 3 and in Supplementary Table S6 the results are 
shown when including all individuals i.e. including histamine negatives). sIgE to any allergen was 
then added to the model to investigate whether sIgE is involved in the causal pathway (Figure 3). 
This did not seem to be the case, given that the odds ratio was very similar though it lost statistical 
significance (OR = 0.51, CI = 0.20–1.32, P = 0.165). As sensitivity analysis, we also looked at the 
impact of further adjustment with variables associated with SPT in univariate analyses. This analysis 
resulted in very similar odds ratios although the P-values tended to be slightly higher (Table 3).   
 
Opisthorchiasis and reported symptoms 
There was a trend of less atopic symptoms in the presence of O. felineus (OR = 0.54, CI = 0.27–1.05, 
P = 0.068, with a priori adjustment). SPT was involved in the causal pathway between opisthorchiasis 
and atopic symptoms (Figure 3). When adding SPT to any allergen to the a priori model, the odds 
ratio changed to 1.02 (CI = 0.49–2.11, P = 0.960), while SPT was significantly associated to atopic 
symptoms (OR = 5.8, CI = 2.6–13.1, P < 0.001). As sensitivity analysis, we adjusted the a priori model 
further with maternal education. The P-value increased but the OR estimate changed only slightly 
(OR = 0.62, CI = 0.31–1.22, P = 0.166, Table 3).  
DISCUSSION 
Numerous studies have shown a negative association between helminth infections and SPT, but 
most, if not all, were conducted in developing countries (21, 22). In such countries it is often difficult 
to disentangle the presence of helminths from poor sanitation (frequent exchange of 
microorganisms) and non-western lifestyle that can also protect against atopy. The presence of O.

felineus infection in the Western-Siberian Tomsk Oblast provides an opportunity to study a helminth 
infection in an area with a more western lifestyle. This study showed a negative association between 
opisthorchiasis and SPT to any allergen allowing us to establish that a chronic helminth infection is 
associated with less skin prick test reactivity even in a developed country.  
In affluent countries, increased exposure to microorganisms is associated with lower specific IgE and 
therefore with lower SPT (23). In the tropical regions where multiple helminth infections are highly 
prevalent, elevated total IgE levels are measured along with elevated specific IgE to allergens. For 
example a study in Indonesia showed total IgE levels to be around 1900-4100 IU/ml, and that 83.4% 
of the schoolchildren had sIgE to HDM or cockroach, whereas only 25.7% were positive in SPT to 
these allergens (9). The negative association found between helminth infections and SPT in tropical 
regions is not reflected in sIgE. In other words, despite high levels of IgE to allergens, the SPT is lower 
in helminth infected subjects (9, 24). Indeed, the odd ratios for being SPT positive, if IgE positive to 
the same allergen, is much lower in developing countries than in affluent countries (24). The 
situation appears to be different in Western-Siberia. First of all, whereas 24.1% of subjects had IgE to 
any allergens, this was 12.8% in SPT reactivity and although this is not showing a one to one 
translation of IgE to SPT, it is not as extreme as what is seen in tropical regions (7, 9). Moreover, in 
our study, O. felineus infection does not seem to lead to extremely high total IgE levels (49.3 IU/mL), 
and even was associated with reduced specific IgE to allergens, although this did not reach statistical 
significance.  Another difference to note is that the association between sIgE and SPT is very strong 
(OR >25), which is much higher than what is seen in tropical areas (24). This could be due to the 
paucity of other helminth infections in Siberia or less cross reactivity between antigens of O. felineus 
and allergens studied; less than described for cross reactivity between schistosomes or filaria and 
peanut or tropomyosin allergens (7, 25). Together, these data indicate that although exposure to O. 
felineus is associated with less SPT, this is not via a reduction in specific IgE as confirmed also by the 
analysis which showed that sIgE did not affect the association between O. felineus and SPT.  
Therefore the situation in Western-Siberia is unlike what is seen in other  developed countries (23).

The negative association could be explained by suppressory network induced by O. felineus, directly 
affecting SPT. This is one of the mechanisms that has been proposed to mediate the lower SPT in 
helminth infected subjects in the tropical countries. 
A negative association was found between O. felineus infection and atopic symptoms, although this 
did not reach statistical significance. Previous studies on allergic symptoms and other helminth 
infections conducted in Ecuador, Cuba and Norway have shown inconsistent results (26-29). This 
indicates that the association between helminths and reported symptoms of atopy are less clear cut 
and could also be affected by the use of questionnaires, which are prone to bias in results.   
The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) has investigated the link 
between SPT sensitivity and allergic symptoms in affluent and non-affluent countries. Comparing the 
prevalences with those in ISAAC phase III similar percentages for  rhinoconjunctivitis and flexural 
eczema were found, but prevalence for wheezing was higher (18.0% versus 11.4% in 6-7 year old or 
11.2% in 13-14 year old children) (1). In affluent countries, both rhinoconjunctivitis (30) and flexural 
eczema were positively correlated to SPT (31), as found in our study population. Contrary to our 
results, a positive association was also found for wheezing, especially in affluent countries (2). It  is 
not clear why in this region SPT is not associated with wheeze but it is possible that Opisthorchis 
infection interferes with the association, as described for hookworm infection (32).  
An unexpected finding of this study was the high percentage of children who had a negative 
histamine reaction, almost 19% (n = 137), who were excluded from analyses of SPT. When we 
repeated the analyses including these children, the conclusion did not change. We used 
standardized extracts and protocols and assessed trained personnel competency based on inter 
assay reproducibility when measuring SPT reactivity. Moreover, the use of anti-histamines could not 
explain these results. In a study of 9-year-old children from Italy, Poland and Libya, mean wheal 
diameters elicited by 10 mg/ml histamine followed a gradient with lowest diameter in Poland (3.75 
mm), then Italy (4.43 mm) and highest in Libya (5.06 mm) (33). The mean diameter of histamine SPT

in our study participants was very similar to that seen in Poland (3.68 mm). As the geographic 
coordinates of Poland and Russia are comparable (52°N for Poland and 56°N for Tomsk), our results 
indicate that further studies are needed to investigate what factors determine negative histamine 
reaction.  
Interestingly, cat/dog ownership, currently as well as in the first two years of life, were positively 
associated with opisthorchiasis. Domestic cats and dogs are involved in the life cycle and 
transmission (11), and therefore could intensify infections in humans. The cross-sectional study 
design is thus a limitation, but our study also has a number of strengths. The same standardized 
methodology and laboratory measurements were used in all three areas, allowing valid comparisons 
to be made. This is the first study providing data on O. felineus infection intensity, as PCR on stool 
samples has been used to determine opisthorchiasis. Furthermore, this method of diagnosis is much 
more sensitive than detection of eggs in stool samples. 
 
In conclusion, this first large scale study conducted in an area with a more western lifestyle and high 
sanitation standards but with prevalent chronic systemic helminth infection, has shown a negative 
association between O. felineus infection and SPT to any allergen, and – although statistical 
significance is not reached – a trend for a negative association with sIgE and atopic symptoms. The 
areas in Western Siberia where opisthorchiasis is endemic could provide unique opportunities to 
find the mechanisms underlying the suppressive effects of helminths on atopy.
