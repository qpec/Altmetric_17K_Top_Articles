Summary 
42 
Massive slums have become major features of cities in many low- and middle-income 
43 
countries. In this, the first in a series of two papers, we show why slums are unhealthy 
44 
places with particularly high risks of infection and injury. We show that children are 
45 
especially vulnerable, and that the combination of malnutrition and recurrent diarrhoea leads 
46 
to stunted growth and longer term effects on cognitive development. We find that the 
47 
literature on slum health is underdeveloped in comparison to urban health, and poverty and 
48 
health. This is important because health is likely to be influenced by factors arising from the 
49 
shared physical and social environment, which have effects beyond those of poverty alone. 
50 
In the second paper we will consider what can be done to improve health and make 
51 
recommendations for the development of slum health as a field of study. 
52 
 
53 
Introduction 
54 
Homo sapiens is undergoing a radical transformation of its ecology.1 During the last two 
55 
centuries the proportion of the world’s population living in cities and towns has grown from 
56 
about 5% to more than 50%. This process of rapid ‘urbanisation’, which started in Europe 
57 
and North America following the Industrial Revolution, was accompanied by the 
58 
development of large slums including famous examples, such as La Chapelle in Paris, 
59 
France, the Gorbals in Glasgow, Scotland, and Khitrov in Moscow, Russia. The last fifty 
60 
years has seen massive urban growth in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) 
61 
characterised by sprawling slums that are now home to more than half of the population in 
62 
cities such as Mumbai, India, Nairobi, Kenya, and Mexico City, Mexico.2 This dramatic 
63 
growth in slums has provoked increasing international interest, and the United Nations 
64 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) specify a target to address the ‘plight of slums’.3 
65 
The broad purpose of this series of two articles is to investigate how this might be achieved 
66 
with respect to health. This, the first paper in the series, is organised as follows. First, we 
67 
 3 
 
provide some background to slums covering terminology and definitions, the size of slum 
68 
populations, and the dynamics of their growth. Second, we make a theoretical argument that 
69 
slum health should be a substantive topic for study, distinct from urban health, and from 
70 
poverty and health. Third, we examine the extent and nature of previous research in slum 
71 
health. Fourth, we describe the physical and social factors affecting health in slums. Fifth, we 
72 
describe the particular health problems of people who live in slums, insofar as this can be 
73 
discerned from the literature. Finally, we conclude.   
74 
 
75 
Background 
76 
Terminology and Definitions 
77 
Concerns have been expressed that the term ‘slum’ is emotive and pejorative.4 The term 
78 
‘informal settlement’ has been suggested as an alternative. However, the United Nations 
79 
continues to refer to ‘slums’, for example in the ‘Sustainable Development Goals’; ‘informal 
80 
settlement’ and ‘slum’ are not synonymous.  
81 
The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) defines a 
82 
slum in terms of an urban space, as “a contiguous settlement where the inhabitants are 
83 
characterised as having inadequate housing and basic services”.5 However, the most widely 
84 
used definition, promulgated by the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-
85 
Habitat), is based on households where a slum household is defined as: “a group of 
86 
individuals that live under the same roof that lack one or more of the following conditions; 
87 
access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living space, durability of 
88 
housing and secure tenure”.2 Each of these five conditions is defined in more detail, for 
89 
example by specifying what type of sanitation qualifies as ‘improved’. Two issues arise from 
90 
these contrasting definitions. First, ‘slum’ is a construct composed of many dimensions – five 
91 
in the case of the UN-Habitat definition – such that no single definition can be entirely 
92 
satisfactory. Second, while people intuitively think of slums as collections of dwellings, this 
93 
 4 
 
spatial construct is not included in the UN-Habitat definition. The concept of slums as spatial 
94 
entities is a unifying theme across both papers in this series.  
95 
 
96 
Population of Slums 
97 
Measuring slum populations is not an exact science for reasons given in Panel A. The most 
98 
recent UN-Habitat estimates for slum populations suggest that 881 million people lived in 
99 
slums in the developing world in 2014,6 up from 689 million in 1990. The number of people 
100 
living in slums is increasing and remains particularly high in sub-Saharan Africa (56% of the 
101 
urban population lives in slums) and Southern and Southeast Asia.6 It is estimated that by 
102 
2030, approximately 5 billion of the world’s projected 8.1 billion people will live in urban 
103 
areas. Of these, about 2 billion will live in slums, primarily in Africa and Asia.2 Most of this 
104 
growth will occur in smaller (tier two) cities where urbanisation continues without adequate 
105 
planning or expansion of infrastructure. What is driving this growth in slum populations? 
106 
 
107 
Panel A: Counting people in slums 
108 
Data used by UN-Habitat to estimate slum populations emanate from two main sources – 
109 
population and housing censuses (conducted every ten years in most countries), and 
110 
national surveys that are often based on sampling frames from censuses. Making an 
111 
assessment of the size of slums is not an exact science because:  
112 
1. 
There is more than one definition of a slum and any particular definition may be applied 
113 
inconsistently. A given definition may change over time; for example, the living space 
114 
threshold of the UN-Habitat definition was increased from over one to over two persons 
115 
per room in 2008.  
116 
2. 
There are technical difficulties in the enumeration of slum populations; they are a ‘hard 
117 
to reach’ group since householders are frequently absent; people may rent rooms by the 
118 
 5 
 
night; illegal squatters may avoid surveys; census staff may be afraid to enter slums; 
119 
and because some countries do not have a census.  
120 
3. 
Many slum communities are not officially gazetted as residential areas and are therefore 
121 
underrepresented in censuses and in national sampling frames.7, 8 China provides an 
122 
example where many “城中村” – literally villages in the city – are populated by 
123 
unregistered migrant workers.9, 10 In some cases, the exact opposite is witnessed, where 
124 
governments over-count slum dwellers either for political motives/support, or for 
125 
budgetary allocations related to service delivery.  
126 
4. Even where data for the UN definition of slums are available for a nation, they are only 
127 
collected every few years, so annual reporting of slum populations has to rely on 
128 
estimates and projections. Projecting the future size of slums is further complicated by 
129 
different rates at which slums are upgraded to non-slum across LMICs.  
130 
5. The threshold for definition of water supply and sanitation is set low, and the worldwide 
131 
estimates of slum populations would inflate by several hundred million if the threshold 
132 
were raised to a level sufficient to protect health.11 In addition, applying the UN slum 
133 
definitions to high-income nations may suggest that they have no slums – but they may 
134 
still have significant proportions of their population living in ‘inadequate housing’. 
135 
The population of slums can be stated as totals or as proportions in which case the 
136 
denominator can be either national or urban populations. These different methods can yield 
137 
diverging trends. For example, in most regions of the world the percentage of the urban 
138 
population living in slums has been declining since 1990, while the total numbers are rising.6 
139 
 
140 
Dynamics and Underlying Causes of Slum Growth 
141 
Urbanisation can be prevented by restricting people’s movement. For example, ‘pass laws’ 
142 
limited internal migration in many colonial countries, while the Chinese government went 
143 
 6 
 
further still by reversing the flow between countryside and city during the Cultural Revolution. 
144 
Removal of restrictions is typically followed by rapid urban migration as happened, for 
145 
example, following the abolition of slavery in Brazil in 1888.12  
146 
Once a population is free to move they will be motivated or constrained by many factors 
147 
(Table 1.1). The increase or decrease in slum populations is a dynamic process involving 
148 
flows of people from countryside and other city precincts, flows in the reverse directions, 
149 
conversion of city districts and peripheral land sites to slums (and vice versa), and the 
150 
balance of births and deaths (natural growth) in the slum itself. As slums age, the proportion 
151 
of growth that is natural (balance of births and deaths) increases, reaching figures as high as 
152 
75% in Mexico City.13 We model this dynamic process in Figure 1.1.

Table 1.1. Factors associated with rural/urban migration* 
157 
Demand (pull) factors 
Supply side (push) factors  
1. Thriving informal economy.14 
2. Unrealistic expectations due to optimism bias, 
inadequate information, or distorted market 
signals, but people and information travel back 
and forth between countryside and city so this 
factor should not be over-emphasised.14 
3. Informed risk-taking, whereby people consciously 
trade a small probability of large gains for the 
status quo, or even ending up worse off.14  
4. Altruistic desire to make reparations to family in 
the countryside,16 and to hedge urban and rural 
risks over the family.13 
5. A sense of adventure and the desire to escape 
the monotony of subsistence farming.17 
1. Environmental degradation.19 
2. Famine.19 
3. Improved agricultural labour 
productivity through 
mechanisation.19  
4. Volatile commodity prices and 
economic shocks.19 
5. Ethnic violence.19 
6. Displacement, for example 
from ‘development’ projects, 
such as construction of 
dams.19  
7. A desire to escape adverse 
social conditions, such as 
 7 
 
6. Lack of barriers to migration (such as a large 
family), and facilitators (such as an existing social 
network in the city to provide temporary 
accommodation, support, and advice).18  
rural caste discrimination in 
India.20 
 
 
*These factors do not, of course, explain growth and persistence of slums – see text.  
158 
 
159 
Explaining what motivates individuals or families to move or stay where they are under 
160 
prevailing conditions, does not explain why the prevailing conditions are as they are. It does 
161 
not account for the enormous size of slums, the number of people who become ‘trapped’ in 
162 
slums over generations,21 or the deepening poverty into which many people sink.22, 23  Nor 
163 
does it explain decoupling of economic and slum population growth – no less than 66 
164 
countries experienced a five year period of urbanisation without concurrent national 
165 
economic growth between 1960 and 1995.24 Many reasons have been proposed to explain 
166 
why slums form, persist, and grow including: national economic stagnation, failure of re-
167 
distribution, market distortion in favour of extractive elites, colonial legacies, lack of planning, 
168 
corruption, ‘clientism’, and anti-urban biases by national governments and international 
169 
agencies. Fox provides a sure-footed account of how these factors have played out over 
170 
time;25 Roy et al. offer a recent systematic review of models of slum growth under sub-
171 
optimal international and national policies;26 and UN-Habitat has published a report on 
172 
factors that are associated with success in reducing slum growth among 100 countries over 
173 
a 20 year period.27 These macro-level factors must be left to further enquiry by historians, 
174 
political scientists, and economists while we will focus on the slums themselves.  
175 
 
176 
Why Slum Health? 
177 
Not all people living in slums live in poverty and many who live in urban poverty reside 
178 
outside of slum areas. Over half of dwellings classified as ‘slum households’ (according to 
179 
the Un-Habitat definition) in Chennai, Delhi and Hyderabad, India fall outside of areas 
180 
 8 
 
classified as slums (according to the Indian definition of 60 contiguous slum households).28 
181 
This means that the health of poor city dwellers is not necessarily a reflection of the health of 
182 
those who live in slums. There are three reasons why living in a slum and living in poverty 
183 
may produce different health outcomes: 
184 
1. People who live in slums share environmental risks, such as those arising from poor 
185 
sanitation – they experience ‘neighbourhood effects’ (Panel B).29, 30 
186 
2. Likewise they benefit collectively from interventions, such as improved sanitation, in 
187 
ways that will be explicated in paper two. 
188 
3. Social and health improvement interventions that work in non-slum localities may not 
189 
be transferrable to slum areas. For example, pit latrines are particularly unsuitable for 
190 
slums (see paper two).  
191 
The health of people who congregate in slums should not be subsumed in urban health or in 
192 
studies of poverty and health. Rather, slums should be studied as spatial entities. Yet, 
193 
censuses, in all but a small number of LMICs, do not identify slum from non-slum urban 
194 
areas. The result is that national surveys, such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), 
195 
which are based on sampling frames derived from national censuses, do not distinguish 
196 
between households that are or are not located in a slum area of a city. Surveys based on 
197 
such censuses simply replicate the well-known association between poverty and health,22, 31 
198 
ignoring the salience of space. We will argue in paper two that this should change and that 
199 
all countries should identify urban census tracts (enumeration areas) as slum or non-slum. 
200 
 
201 
Panel B: Neighbourhood effects 
202 
A large body of literature attests to the existence of ‘neighbourhood effects’ on health. 
203 
Neighbourhood effects refer to factors that influence health at the community level 
204 
independent of individual household level factors, including individual household levels of 
205 
poverty/deprivation. They encompass pervasive effects operating across the spaces in 
206 
 9 
 
which people live. The mechanisms by which neighbourhoods exert their effects have been 
207 
classified in various ways. We provide examples of neighbourhood effects based on one 
208 
such classification system 32 in the Table. 
209 
 
210 
Table: General and slum-specific evidence of neighbourhood effects

Type of neighbourhood 
effect 32 
Example 
Example from slum context 
Physical environment 
The risk of childhood illness in 
Indian families is more strongly 
correlated with a neighbour’s 
defecation patterns than with 
the family’s defecation 
behaviour.33 
Slum environment and water 
supply is heavily contaminated 
with faeces in many slums.34 
Social interactions 
An experimental study in the 
USA showed that providing 
vouchers to move to a better-off 
neighbourhood improved health 
in the short-term, and young 
children’s prospects in the long-
term.35 
Crime rates vary considerably 
among slums, reflecting 
different cultures that have 
developed within them.2 
Geographic factors  
Poor people in rich cities in the 
USA have better health than 
equally poor people in poor 
cities.31  
Many slums are exposed to 
geographic hazards, such as 
flooding, subsidence, and local 
pollution from factories.36 
Institutional factors  
Teachers may have lower 
expectations of pupils who live 
in poor neighbourhoods.32 
Some slums are stigmatised so 
that residents’ rights are 
infringed to the point of 
expropriation.37 
 
212 
Many authors 38-40 have examined slum effects in observational studies using multi-variate 
213 
modelling techniques to separate individual, household, and neighbourhood contributors to 
214 
health. However, identification of neighbourhood effects from observational studies is fraught 
215 
with difficulty that might lead to under- and/or over-estimation.41 The study of neighbourhood 
216 
effects thus leans heavily on studies of underlying mechanisms (for example, showing that 
217 
soil and water are contaminated by faeces, or that overcrowding is associated with stress), 
218 
and studies where the environment is manipulated under experimental (or quasi-
219 
experimental) control (discussed in paper two). Rare instances exist where it has been 
220 
 10 
 
possible to observe the effects of taking part in a lottery that allows some people to move to 
221 
a new environment while others remain in their original neighbourhood – the Moving to 
222 
Opportunity experiments in the USA 35 and India,42 for example. 
223 
 
224 
The idea of slums as spaces is central to the notion of slum health. That said, it is also the 
225 
case that while slums exist in space, these spaces are not homogenous but vary 
226 
considerably within and between slums in terms of population density, security of tenure, 
227 
official recognition, provision of services, topography, and social and economic make-up.43 
228 
Context can have a large effect on the effectiveness of interventions as we discuss in paper 
229 
two. 
230 
 
231 
Slum Health – a Neglected Subject? 
232 
We describe our literature retrieval algorithms in Panel C. Our intention was not only to 
233 
obtain literature to examine slum health but also, given the salience of neighbourhood 
234 
effects, to compare and contrast this literature with the literature on urban health generally, 
235 
rural health, and poverty and health.  
236 
Panel C: Search strategy and selection criteria 
237 
To gauge the relative attention the topic of slum health has received in medical research and 
238 
to characterise the nature of academic literature on slum health, we firstly carried out 
239 
bibliometric analyses of the relative volume of research studies concerning rural, urban and 
240 
slum settings (Web Appendix 1.2.1) and the number of registered clinical trials in these 
241 
settings in low- and middle-income countries (Web Appendix 1.2.2). 
242 
In order to identify key literature for the diffuse topic of slum health, we conducted a 
243 
systematic overview of reviews covering determinants of health in slum settings and/or 
244 
interventions that aim to improve the health of slum dwellers. Given that the identified 
245 
 11 
 
literature on determinants of health mainly draws evidence from cross-sectional studies that 
246 
are subject to selection effects as described in the text, we undertook a further systematic 
247 
review of cohort studies in slums. Acknowledging the important roles that international, 
248 
governmental and non-governmental organisations play in this area, we also systematically 
249 
searched the grey literature and reviewed relevant documents. Details of literature search 
250 
and study selection criteria for these reviews are provided in the text below. 
251 
 
252 
1. Systematic overview of reviews concerned with slum health 
253 
We searched the following eight databases in January 2016: MEDLINE, including in-process 
254 
and non-indexed citations, Embase, PsycINFO, LILACS, SciELO, WHO Global Health 
255 
Library, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, maintained by the NHS Centre for 
256 
Reviews and Dissemination, and CINAHL (all but two of the reviews detailed here were 
257 
found in MEDLINE or Embase). We put no limits on dates covered. In order to make the 
258 
search as sensitive as possible we included a wide range of synonyms for slums, derived 
259 
from a list in a UN-Habitat report 44 and augmented by other terms we have encountered: 
260 
baladi, bandas de miseria, barraca, barrio marginal, barrio, bidonville, brarek, bustee, chalis, 
261 
chereka bete, dagatan, estero, favela, galoos, gecekondu, ghetto, hrushebi, informal 
262 
settlement, ishash, karyan, katras, looban, loteamento, medina achouaia, morro, mudun safi, 
263 
musseque, shanty town, slum, solares, tanake, taudis, township, tugurio, udukku, 
264 
umjondolo, watta, and zopadpattis. We further broadened our search by combining free-text 
265 
synonyms with controlled vocabulary for slums and, where supported in the database, filters 
266 
for systematic reviews. No language restrictions were applied. We examined the titles and 
267 
abstracts of unique records and selected reviews (both systematic and narrative reviews) 
268 
that: 1) specifically provided results for people who live in slums; 2) specifically included 
269 
people who live in slums but did not provide specific results for the sub-group; and 3) 
270 
included the urban poor and hence were likely to have included slum dwellers, although this 
271 
 12 
 
was not specified. We selected reviews dealing with: a) the distribution and determinants of 
272 
health relevant to slum settings, which are included in the evidence base for paper one (for a 
273 
summary of identified studies see Web Appendix 1.4, Table A5); and b) interventions for 
274 
slum populations, reporting health outcomes, which are included in the evidence base for 
275 
paper two (for a summary of identified studies see Table 2.2, paper two). Please note that 
276 
some of the identified reviews reported both on the epidemiology of health conditions, and 
277 
interventions to improve these health conditions, in which case they are included in the 
278 
evidence base for both papers. A flow diagram for study retrieval and selection is available in 
279 
Web Appendix 1.3.1 
280 
 
281 
2. Systematic review of primary cohort studies relating to slum health 
282 
We searched for primary cohort studies using MEDLINE and Embase (which support the 
283 
necessary search filter for cohort studies) relating to slum populations, using the same free-
284 
text and controlled vocabulary terms for slums as stated in search one above. After 
285 
examining the titles and abstracts of the unique records this search returned, we selected 
286 
relevant studies (studies that prospectively recruited people living in slums and observed 
287 
them over at least two occasions over time). We located 128 studies meeting this criteria 
288 
and classified them by key themes (e.g. paediatric nutrition and diarrhea; injury), integrating 
289 
these throughout the text as appropriate with other relevant studies. There was only one 
290 
study found in search two that had been picked up by the reviews identified through search 
291 
one. The study retrieval and selection process is also shown in the flow diagram in Web 
292 
Appendix 1.3.1 
293 
 
294 
3. Systematic review of the grey literature  
295 
We searched the grey literature by reviewing official reports from the publication databases 
296 
of the World Bank, World Health Organization, and UN-Habitat on the basis of expert advice 
297 
 13 
 
from the authors. We covered the literature from January 2010 to February 2016. Our search 
298 
terms included synonyms for slums in searches one and two above. Eight hundred and 
299 
eighty-four results were returned, and after examining the titles, abstracts, and text of these 
300 
studies and reports we selected 245 publications that dealt partially or wholly with issues 
301 
arising in slums. For a breakdown of publications see Web Appendix 1.3.2. Many important 
302 
articles were found in this literature, including those relating to the economics of slum 
303 
formation, system level interventions (such as the effect of providing tenure/title), and certain 
304 
notable large scale studies, including a randomised trial of home improvement.  
305 
We supplement the above three reviews with additional searches as needed on the advice 
306 
of experts (such as the searches for literature related to neighbourhood effects in slums, 
307 
Web Appendix 1.3.3), and further extended these with authors’ collections of references and 
308 
additional papers identified by subject experts. 
309 
 
310 
The bibliometric analysis supports the hypothesis that slum health has received scant 
311 
attention compared with rural health, urban health, and poverty and health: 
312 
1. Studies on slum health make up only a small proportion of the LMIC literature. For 
313 
instance only 2·8% of LMIC papers on MEDLINE and Embase that stated where the 
314 
study was carried out were based in a slum location (Web Appendix 1.2.1).  
315 
2. Only 7% LMIC trials registered on the WHO Clinical Trials Registry Platform that 
316 
stated where the trial was carried out were based in a slum location and in many 
317 
cases slums were chosen as a convenience sample, for instance to study the effects 
318 
of a new vaccine, rather than to examine slum health or how to improve it (Web 
319 
Appendix 1.2.2).  
320 
3.  There is no MeSH term for ‘slum’ or its synonyms on MEDLINE or Embase. 
321 
Further evidence that slum health is a neglected topic can be found by examining the 
322 
location of the 38 Demographic Surveillance Sites based in Africa; only one (the Nairobi 
323 
 14 
 
Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System) is based entirely in a slum area. In 
324 
addition, slums are not identified as a determinant of health in the influential Global Burden 
325 
of Disease report.45  
326 
Before moving on to discuss the findings on health and its determinants it is worth 
327 
mentioning the type of literature retrieved and its possible biases. Most literature on health 
328 
and welfare in slums is based on cross-sectional studies that are subject to selection effects, 
329 
including: 
330 
1. Those who migrate are healthier on average than those who remain in rural settings 
331 
(healthy mover effect). 
332 
2. Those who transition rapidly through the slums are under-represented relative to all 
333 
who have been exposed to slums (a form of ‘rate bias’). 
334 
These factors may lead to potential bias when seeking to make an inference about the effect 
335 
of moving to a slum from another place, or the net effect of slums on health or wellbeing. 
336 
The second factor can be mitigated by use of longitudinal studies; the rationale for a specific 
337 
search for such studies (Panel C). 
338 
 
339 
Living and Working Conditions in Slums 
340 
Slums are usually formed close to areas where work is available. Under population 
341 
pressures the slum pushes upward (stories added to dwellings) and outward. Competition 
342 
for sites close to places of work causes inflation in rents and land prices so that landlords in 
343 
central locations may end up quite well-off, while those at the periphery become 
344 
progressively disadvantaged;46, 47 the Gini coefficient (a measure of income inequality) in 
345 
Bangladesh is larger within slums than across the country as a whole.48 This is important 
346 
because increasing poverty generates health inequality, which in turn leads to deeper 
347 
poverty creating a vicious circle (or poverty trap).38 
348 
 15 
 
Security of tenure is a key issue for slum households. Slums are often set up on unclaimed 
349 
or municipal land.49 It is then up to the authorities to decide whether or not to recognise the 
350 
slum and confer residency rights on citizens – such ‘notified’ locations make up only about 
351 
half of all slums in India, for example.50 People with no rights have little incentive to invest in 
352 
healthier homes and may be evicted without compensation to provide more lucrative middle-
353 
class housing to the benefit of an ‘extractive elite’; slum landlords and local government 
354 
officials may be one and the same.51 Large scale evictions have taken place under apartheid 
355 
in South Africa,52 state capitalism in China,53 and even democratic local government in 
356 
Brazil.54 The injustice and inhumanity of these evictions is compounded by the plight of the 
357 
displaced settlers who must move to new locations that are even more disadvantaged, in 
358 
terms of access to the labour market and environmental safety, than their original slum 
359 
habitat,55 again widening inequalities. 
360 
Whether through eviction or a shortage of space, people in slums may inhabit dangerous 
361 
locations such as ravines, where they are subject to landslides (Caracas, Venezuela), flood 
362 
plains, where they are subject to drowning and loss of homes (Manila, Philippines), and 
363 
under power lines increasing the risk of fires (Nairobi). In Quito, Ecuador, people who live in 
364 
slums have been forced above the 2850 metre city limit that marks the highest level that can 
365 
be serviced by the municipal water distribution system.56 People who live in slums are also 
366 
especially vulnerable to the effects of global warming. For example, poorly constructed 
367 
homes are ill-equipped to withstand the elements and mortality risk from tropical cyclones 
368 
(after controlling for storm intensity) is over a hundred times greater in low-income compared 
369 
to high-income countries.57 
370 
Slums provide access to markets for millions of people and provide conditions where micro-
371 
enterprises become established.58 The informal sector is worth US$10 trillion per year 
372 
globally and employs 80% of the workforce in LMICs.59  But people live hand to mouth as 
373 
day-to-day existence requires out-of-pocket payments, not just for food and accommodation, 
374 
but for basic amenities, such as water, access to toilets, cooking fuel, transportation, and 
375 
 16 
 
education. Informal sector workers with minimal statutory rights and who lose income when 
376 
they are absent from work 60 are at a particular disadvantage if they live in slum areas with 
377 
long and costly commutes. Health facilities, if present, are closed when they return from 
378 
work and they cannot attend appointments for immunisation, antenatal care, or care of long-
379 
term conditions. Women, earn on average only a third of men’s earnings in urban areas of 
380 
sub-Saharan Africa.60  
381 
Not only is there an economic and social gradient within slums, but slums themselves may 
382 
differ from each other, not just economically, but socially. This is illustrated with respect to 
383 
crime where some slums (e.g. Kumasi in Ghana and Surabaya in Indonesia 2) have low 
384 
crime rates, while others are dominated by criminal gangs, as in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and 
385 
Caracas, Venezuela 61, 62 leading to the concept of ‘slums of hope and slums of despair’.63  It 
386 
would be useful if high risk localities could be identified on the basis of their characteristics 
387 
and a study across 48 slum areas in Mumbai, India identified maternal and child health risk 
388 
areas with high specificity but low sensitivity on the basis of access to water and sanitation, 
389 
housing quality, and tenancy status.64 We have not located studies to identify risk by higher 
390 
level factors such as size of slums, and have cited limited information suggesting that large 
391 
established slums have lower social capital than newer slums. There is a positive correlation 
392 
between average duration of residence in a slum and the prevalence of violence in that 
393 
slum.38 Strong social pressures in slums can affect drug use and teenage sexual behaviour 
394 
at the community level. We explore some of these through the words of mothers of teenage 
395 
children in Web Appendix 1.1. 
396 
Slum dwellings are loosely fitted together from available materials allowing easy access for 
397 
vectors of disease. Under the sun corrugated iron dwellings become oppressively hot, while 
398 
at night temperatures in high altitude cities can plummet to lows of -4·4°C in Mexico City, 
399 
Mexico and -0·5°C in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Many slums households do not have piped 
400 
water or lavatories. Pit-latrines contaminate the environment and the water supply is prone 
401 
to contamination at multiple points. Homes are crowded and afford little privacy. Cooking 
402 
 17 
 
and heating with solid fuels in confined spaces pollutes the air with noxious fumes and 
403 
particulate matter. Streets and lanes are unpaved with no drainage and are therefore 
404 
converted to mud and stagnant pools when it rains. Garbage collects in huge, malodourous 
405 
piles and often contains excrement. There is little open space where children can play safely 
406 
or where adults can relax.  
407 
The determinants of health interact and are highly reinforcing.65 For instance, poor maternal 
408 
mental health postnatally reduces willingness to breastfeed and also affects the mother’s 
409 
bonding to her child, placing the child at risk physically and socially. Early weaning, failure to 
410 
immunise, exposure to contaminated water, and malnutrition interact producing enteropathy 
411 
and stunting, which in turn predispose to reduced school performance, and reduced life 
412 
chances. If a mother does not breastfeed, her fertility will return quickly after childbirth, 
413 
resulting in reduced spacing between children. As a result less time, money, and loving 
414 
support can be given to each child. If a parent develops a serious disease, such as recurrent 
415 
tuberculosis, the family will suffer catastrophic financial loss (due to cost of healthcare and 
416 
loss of earnings) reducing educational opportunities. It is time to examine in more detail how 
417 
slum neighbourhoods predispose their inhabitants to disease. 
418 
 
419 
Health in SlumsChild Mortality 
420 
It is difficult to measure the life expectancy of people who live in slums because they move 
421 
to and fro and may return to rural areas to die. However, child mortality is easier to ascertain. 
422 
While child mortality is similar between rural and urban locations overall 66 comparisons 
423 
between slum areas specifically and the countryside tell a different story. Higher infant 
424 
and/or neonatal mortality in slum versus rural areas has been found in Kenya, Ecuador, 
425 
Brazil, Haiti, and in the Philippines 67-69, although rural areas with particularly high malaria 
426 
exposures may experience even higher child mortality rates than high altitude slums.70 We 
427 
have examined this issue further by analysing survey data from Bangladesh and Kenya; two 
428 
 18 
 
countries where the census distinguishes between slum and non-slum urban areas (Table 
429 
1.2). We find that slums have worse health outcomes for children than the rural populations 
430 
of both countries. Even if we define the rural poor as the lowest tertile by socioeconomic 
431 
status, children have higher mortality rates in the slums of Nairobi. Diarrhoea and 
432 
pneumonia are the two main worldwide killers of children under five years 71, 72 and there 
433 
seems little doubt that young children (under five years) are at particularly high risk in slums 
434 
as discussed below in more detail.

Table 1.2 Legend: For the comparison of early childhood mortality among slums, rural poor, 
449 
all urban, and national populations, we used data from slum surveys and the DHS. For 
450 
Kenya, data for slums were extracted from the Nairobi Cross-sectional Slum survey 2000, 
451 
and 2012,73 and for all other residential domains, data were extracted from DHS 2003, and 
452 
2014.74 In Bangladesh, indicators for slum population were extracted from the Urban Health 
453 
Survey 2006, and 2013.75 The corresponding indicator data for other residential domains 
454 
were extracted from Bangladesh DHS 2007, and 2014.76 
455 
This study was made possible by slum-specific indicators that are tagged on to residential 
456 
domains in census and surveys in Bangladesh and Kenya. In Kenya, the selection of slums 
457 
for the survey was informed by 1999 and 2009 census listings that identified slum 
458 
enumeration areas. A weighted cross-sectional sample was designed, representative of 
459 
households in all slum clusters of Nairobi in 2000 and 2012. In the Urban Health Survey in 
460 
Bangladesh slums were defined as areas of concentrated vulnerability. Using satellite 
461 
images from census 2005 as a starting point, four criteria for identifying slums were used: 
462 
poor housing conditions, high overall density, poor environmental services, and high 
463 
prevalence (over 75 percent) of people with income below the poverty level. The rural poor 
464 
were classified as the lower tertile of the rural population based on wealth scores data from 
465 
the respective DHS. 
466 
It is noteworthy that mortality rates are declining in both countries in both rural and slum 
467 
areas. In Nairobi, however, the situation of children in the slum areas relative to rural poor 
468 
children appears to have worsened over time.  
469 
 
470 
 
471 
 
472 
 
 
473 
 21 
 
When children move to slums from the countryside they are most vulnerable immediately 
474 
following their arrival, presumably because they have little immunity to the organisms in their 
475 
new neighbourhood.77 When compared to children whose parents do not leave for the city, 
476 
children left behind in the countryside have unchanged or even improved health – perhaps 
477 
as the result of remittances.78, 79 
478 
 
479 
Infectious diseases 
480 
Pit latrines with slabs qualify as ‘improved sanitation’ in the World Health Organization 
481 
(WHO) / United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Joint Monitoring Programme definition.11 
482 
Yet such facilities are inappropriate in a crowded slum environment.80 Even when judged 
483 
against this low standard, only 40% of the urban population in sub-Saharan Africa had 
484 
‘improved sanitation’, while 33% had piped water in their homes in 2015. The situation in 
485 
slums specifically can only be worse. Gastrointestinal infections are highly prevalent in slums 
486 
67, 81 and children under five years old are particularly vulnerable (see below).  Two 
487 
systematic reviews of cholera outbreaks in Africa identified slum neighbourhoods as the 
488 
usual source of the epidemic.82, 83 Slum dwellers perceive water and sanitation as their most 
489 
pressing need.84 Interestingly, slum life may protect children from the effects of polio 
490 
because the virus is likely to be contracted at a particularly early age in slum areas, and 
491 
hence at a stage when the baby is still protected by maternal antibodies.85  
492 
Accumulation of rubbish and poor housing provide breeding grounds for parasites and 
493 
vectors of disease. Leptospirosis is a particular problem, resulting from the proliferation of 
494 
rats in garbage and persistence of the bacterium in surface water and mud.86, 87 Dengue 
495 
fever is one of the few infectious diseases that is increasing globally,45 and its vector, the 
496 
Aedes mosquito, is particularly adapted to survival in slum areas, in contrast to the 
497 
Anopheles mosquito, which thrives in high sunlight and plentiful vegetation.88 
498 
 
499 
 22 
 
Social factors affect transmission of disease. Sojourns in rural areas bring ‘rural’ diseases 
500 
(e.g. schistosomiasis) into the city.89 Overcrowding contributes to the high prevalence of 
501 
tuberculosis. Slum residents are a young, highly mobile population contributing to the higher 
502 
incidence of HIV in slums compared to non-slum city areas.90 In the recent Ebola epidemic in 
503 
West Africa, slum conditions amplified spread of the disease.91 
504 
 
505 
Under-nutrition and malnutrition  
506 
Under-nutrition is the leading indirect cause of childhood mortality and morbidity in sub-
507 
Saharan Africa.92 Recent surveys of food insecurity specifically in slums found rates of 85% 
508 
of households in Nairobi,93 77% in Northern India,94 and 74% in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.95 
509 
Three reviews examining diet and nutrition in slums 67, 96, 97 all showed that people who live in 
510 
slums were at a nutritional disadvantage compared with other urban residents. People who 
511 
live in slums rely on street vendors of pre-cooked foods for about a fifth of their calorie 
512 
intake.98  
513 
Under-nutrition interacts with recurrent diarrhoea 99-101 in children leading to stunted 
514 
growth.102 A systematic review reports that across multiple regions (including the Democratic 
515 
Republic of Congo, Bolivia, India, Bangladesh, and Kenya) the rate of stunting in children 
516 
residing in slums is higher than in non-slum urban or rural areas.23, 77 Early childhood 
517 
diarrhoea also impacts child cognitive development,103-106 the economic consequences of 
518 
which 107 are overlooked in cost-effectiveness studies of slum improvement (paper two).  
519 
Exclusive breastfeeding to age six months and partial breastfeeding from 6-23 months 
520 
reduce incidence of, and mortality from, diarrhoea and pneumonia, and also reduces all-
521 
cause mortality in LMICs.101 Breastfeeding rates are low in slums,108 partly due to labour 
522 
market conditions that make it difficult for mothers to either stay at home or take their babies 
523 
to work with them. 
524 
 
525 
 23 
 
Injury, accidents and violence  
526 
Trauma accounts for 10% of deaths worldwide and this proportion is increasing.45 According 
527 
to a recent study in Nairobi in slums, injury accounted for 22% of all deaths among adults, 
528 
over a half of all deaths among men under 35 years, and 69% of deaths in young men aged 
529 
15-19. Over half of all injury related deaths resulted from assault.109 Although data are not 
530 
available for control areas, we have noted that the social environment differs greatly across 
531 
slums and this is likely to influence crime and hence injury rates as discussed earlier. 
532 
A review on child health reported that paediatric burns are more frequent in slums than in 
533 
non-slum urban, or rural areas,77 largely due to cooking methods. A cohort study of children 
534 
in the Kibera slum, Kenya found an incidence of burns that was ten times higher than across 
535 
LMICs as a whole.110 
536 
 
537 
Mental health 
538 
Neuropsychiatric conditions are, according to one estimate, the single leading cause of 
539 
years of life lost to ill-health, disability, or early death (DALYs) worldwide.111 The living and 
540 
working conditions in slums predisposes to stress (as described above) and stress leads to 
541 
psychological disorders112 such as those seen among workers in garment factories in 
542 
Bangladesh.113 We found one systematic review which reported that children living in slums 
543 
experience more behavioural and emotional problems than children living in rural or non-
544 
slum urban areas.77 Our principle finding is that there is very little direct literature on slum 
545 
mental health or how it may be affected by the social milieu in slum neighbourhoods.  
546 
 
547 
Non-communicable diseases 
548 
Non-communicable diseases now outweigh communicable diseases as a cause of loss of 
549 
life years even in LMICs.45 Just two reviews examined non-communicable diseases in 
550 
 24 
 
slums, both focussed on the high prevalence of childhood asthma.114, 115 Indoor cooking with 
551 
solid fuels is a cause of respiratory disease in poor households generally,116 and the 
552 
unsanitary conditions in slums are associated with up-regulation of inflammatory responses 
553 
leading to a high prevalence of non-atopic asthma, in contrast to high-income countries 
554 
where, according to the hygiene hypothesis, allergy results from excessive cleanliness.114  
555 
Rates for hypertension were slightly lower in slums than in other populations both in a 
556 
Kenyan 117 and Brazilian study 118. The former study also examined treatment and control of 
557 
hypertension, which was less comprehensive in the slum setting – a finding consistent with 
558 
the above mentioned problem of accessing healthcare in slums. With respect to other major 
559 
non-communicable diseases, cardiovascular disease, cancer and diabetes, the risk among 
560 
people who live in slums is poorly documented. Cigarettes are unaffordable to many and 
561 
there is evidence that the number of cigarettes consumed by smokers in slums is very much 
562 
lower than smokers in general.93 Women and men in slums are heavier and exercise less 
563 
rural dwellers but have more exercise and are less obese than non-slum urban controls.119 
564

Nearly a billion people live in slums and this is projected to double by 2030. This is not 
567 
reflected in the literature, which is rudimentary when compared to the heft of the literature on 
568 
urban health generally, rural health, and the relationship between poverty and health. Yet 
569 
there are good reasons to study slum health specifically, since slums are spaces where 
570 
neighbourhood effects are likely to exist, mediated through factors such as faecal 
571 
contamination of the environment, garbage mountains, stagnant ground water, 
572 
overcrowding, poorly constructed homes, physical hazards (such as burns, scalds, and 
573 
accidental fires), and indoor and outdoor pollution. More generic determinants of health 
574 
include job insecurity, lack of tenure/title, poor transport networks, stigmatisation, and the 
575 
social structures within slums that vary from supportive to highly toxic.  
576 
 25 
 
Given these determinants it comes as no surprise that people in slums have much worse 
577 
health than those in non-slum urban areas. More controversial is the effect of slum versus 
578 
rural habitation. Here we find that the so-called ‘urban bias’ in favour of urban areas, does 
579 
not necessarily extend to slums, and that, at least in some slums and on some dimensions 
580 
of health, people who live in slums have worse health than the rural poor. This, of course, 
581 
does not mean that people have made a miscalculation in moving to slums because those 
582 
with short sojourn times are under-represented in cross-sectional samples. However, those 
583 
who remain in slums can enter a downward spiral of ill health and financial distress leading 
584 
to ‘poverty traps’ from which escape is difficult, as Jeffrey Sachs has shown.23, 120  
585 
Another important finding relates to the particular vulnerability of children in slums. They are 
586 
more susceptible to infections, such as diarrhoea, and suffer long-term consequences in 
587 
terms of health and life chances – the topic of a recent systematic review.107 It is for this 
588 
reason that we will stress the plight of children in paper two. Another particularly stark finding 
589 
is the high rate of violent death among young adult males – a topic worthy of further enquiry. 
590 
The literature on mental health and chronic disease in slum populations is disproportionately 
591 
small. Such evidence as we have been able to glean suggests that hypertension, an 
592 
enormous emerging problem in sub-Saharan Africa is, in fact, less prevalent in slums than in 
593 
other urban areas. Likewise, smokers tend to smoke a considerably smaller number of 
594 
cigarettes in slums than elsewhere. We have not examined evidence on obesity and 
595 
diabetes in slum populations, although we have received anecdotal reports that this is a 
596 
rising problem. 
597 
In paper two we will turn our attention to what can be done to improve health in slums and to 
598 
show that neighbourhood effects can be turned to advantage when interventions are 
599 
promulgated. We will also make positive suggestions to make slums more visible to 
600 
policymakers and to enhance the depth and breadth of research in support of people who 
601 
live in slums.

Key messages 
603 
1. The population of slums has increased massively in size over the last 60 years and 
604 
slums now dominate many cities in LMICs, and are increasing in total population 
605 
size, particularly in Africa.  
606 
2. Slum health issues are widely subsumed in urban health and the relationship 
607 
between poverty and health. Failure to recognise slums as spatial entities obscures 
608 
neighbourhood effects that are likely to have potential influence on health in slums.  
609 
3. There is a long and unfortunate history in which people in slums have been 
610 
marginalised and even stigmatised with the result that they experience expropriation 
611 
of property, displacement, and denial of access to basic services. 
612 
4. People in slums frequently live hand to mouth so that when illness occurs the victim 
613 
is likely to fall into extreme poverty, which in turn leads to worse health leading to 
614 
extreme inequality and poverty traps.  
615 
5. Inadequate water supply, sanitation, drainage, and garbage collection in a crowded 
616 
environment predisposes to recurrent diarrhoea and diseases such as typhoid, hook 
617 
worm, and cholera.  
618 
6. Children are especially vulnerable in slums because of low breastfeeding rates, 
619 
under-nutrition, and poor sanitation, predisposing to chronic diarrhoea, stunting, and 
620 
impaired cognitive development. Child health was found to be even worse in slums 
621 
than among the rural poor in numerous studies.  
622 
7. Reservoirs and vectors for infectious diseases such as dengue, leishmaniasis, and 
623 
leptospirosis flourish in slum environments.  
624 
8. The shared physical and social environment of slums exposes residents to health 
625 
risks of injury from fire, extreme weather, and crime. 
626 
9. Insufficient attention has been paid to mental health and non-communicable diseases 
627 
in stressful slum environments, or of how slum characteristics might influence health 
628 
outcomes.  
629 
 27 
 
10. Slum health should be distinguished from urban health and mainstreamed in the 
630 
implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the New Urban Agenda.

Figure 1.1: Basic model depicting population flows between countryside and the city 
665 
and between formal versus slum precincts of the city* 
666 
* Use of yearly transition rates enable dynamic flow to be modelled net of seasonal 
667 
fluctuations. 
668 
A key transition in the generation of slums is movement between countryside and city – t1 
669 
and t3. According to a famous model from Harris and Todaro 14 migration from the 
670 
countryside is propelled by surplus labour on the land in the run up to the demographic 
671 
transition and a growing demand for labour in the cities, which generates a gap in expected 
672 
wealth.14 
673 
Transitions from city to countryside are represented by t2 and t4. A sustained period (five 
674 
years or more) where migration from city to countryside exceeded migration from 
675 
countryside to city (t2 and t4) > (t1 and t3) happened in only five LMICs in a 35 year period 
676 
(1960-1995) and these include the massive upheavals in China and Cambodia.  
677 
People move from formal city precincts to slums because of their financial circumstances, 
678 
but this transition (t5) also occurs when previously better off areas fall into decay through 
679 
economic recession and middle-class flight, as happened in previously fashionable precincts 
680 
of Lima, Peru.15 The reverse transition (t6) can also come about because people move from 
681 
slum to formal precincts or because a slum is upgraded to a non-slum area. The balance 
682 
between t5 and t6 is, of course, critical to the question of whether slums expand or contract, 
683 
as discussed in the text.
