IMPORTANCE Younger women (aged �50 years) who underwent breast conservation
therapy may benefit from breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screening as an adjunct
to mammography.
OBJECTIVE To prospectively determine the cancer yield and tumor characteristics of
combined mammography with MRI or ultrasonography screening in women who underwent
breast conservation therapy for breast cancers and who were 50 years or younger at initial
diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized study
was conducted from December 1, 2010, to January 31, 2016, at 6 academic institutions. Seven
hundred fifty-four women who were 50 years or younger at initial diagnosis and who had
undergone breast conservation therapy for breast cancer were recruited to participate in the
study. Reference standard was defined as a combination of pathology and 12-month
follow-up.
INTERVENTIONS Participants underwent 3 annual MRI screenings of the conserved and
contralateral breasts in addition to mammography and ultrasonography, with independent
readings.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Cancer detection rate, sensitivity, specificity, interval cancer
rate, and characteristics of detected cancers.
RESULTS A total of 754 women underwent 2065 mammograms, ultrasonography, and MRI
screenings. Seventeen cancers were diagnosed, and most of the detected cancers (13 of 17
[76%]) were stage 0 or stage 1. Overall cancer detection rate (8.2 vs 4.4 per 1000; P = .003)
or sensitivity (100% vs 53%; P = .01) of mammography with MRI was higher than that of
mammography alone. After the addition of ultrasonography, the cancer detection rate was
higher than that by mammography alone (6.8 vs 4.4 per 1000; P = .03). The specificity of
mammography with MRI or ultrasonography was lower than that by mammography alone
(87% or 88% vs 96%; P < .001). No interval cancer was found.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE After breast conservation therapy in women 50 years or
younger, the addition of MRI to annual mammography screening improves detection of
early-stage but biologically aggressive breast cancers at acceptable specificity. Results from
this study can inform patient decision making on screening methods after breast
conservation therapy.

omen who are treated with breast conservation sur-
gery and radiotherapy (BCT) remain at an in-
creased risk for second breast cancers, which can be
either a local recurrence or a new primary in the conserved and
contralateral breast at 5-year (approximately 10%) and 10-
year (approximately 20%) follow-up visits.1-3 Because early de-
tection of second breast cancers at the asymptomatic phase
in breast cancer survivors can improve their relative survival
by27%to47%,4theAmericanSocietyofClinicalOncologyand
the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommend an-
nual mammography screening or surveillance for women who
received BCT.5-7 However, although mammography screen-
ing detects early-stage second breast cancers, lower sensitiv-
ity and higher interval cancer rates were observed in women
withapersonalhistoryofbreastcancercomparedwithwomen
without, especially in women 50 years or younger and those
with extremely dense breasts.8
TheAmericanCancerSocietyguidelinesuggeststhatthere
is insufficient evidence to recommend or advise against an-
nual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) screenings for women
with a personal history of breast cancer, while MRI screening
is recommended as an adjunct to mammography for women
withgeneticmutationsorwomenwithmorethana20%to25%
lifetime risk of breast cancer.9 Women with a personal his-
tory of breast cancer, however, have a heterogeneous risk for
developing a second breast cancer.10 According to a model of
cancer risk, women with early-stage, hormone receptor–
positive breast cancer who were not BRCA mutation carriers
fit a 20% lifetime cancer-risk threshold for developing a sec-
ond breast cancer if they were 50 years or younger and had un-
dergone BCT but not a total mastectomy.11 As MRI or ultraso-
nographyscreeningstodetectsecondbreastcancersinwomen
after BCT have been increasingly used12-15 despite limited evi-
dence regarding their comparative effectiveness, it has been
reported that 45% to 54% of women who were screened for
breast cancer using MRI or ultrasonography had a personal his-
tory of breast cancer.14,15 Retrospective studies have shown
similar cancer detection rates but significantly lower false-
positive screening, defined as an unnecessary recall, biopsy, or
short-term follow-up of MRI or ultrasonography screening in
womenwithapersonalhistoryofbreastcancercomparedwith
those without a personal history of breast cancer or those with
a genetic risk for or a family history of breast cancer.15,16
To our knowledge, there has been no prospective study to
compare, among the same participants, the performance of a
combination of imaging techniques for breast cancer screen-
ing: mammography and MRI or ultrasonography vs mammog-
raphy alone for women after BCT. Thus, the purpose of our
study was to compare outcomes of a combined mammogra-
phy and MRI or ultrasonography screening in women who had
received BCT for breast cancer before age 50 years.
Methods
Study Participants and Study Conduct
For this prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, observa-
tionalcohortstudy(clinicaltrials.govIdentifier:NCT01257152),
we recruited asymptomatic women who were 50 years or
younger at the initial diagnosis of breast cancer, who had un-
dergone BCT, and who came in for a mammogram at 6 differ-
ent academic centers (Seoul National University Hospital,
Samsung Medical Center, Asan Medical Center, Seoul St Mary's
Hospital, Severance Hospital, and Seoul National University
Bundang Hospital) between December 1, 2010, and January 31,
2016. Each facility met the American College of Radiology
Imaging Network (ACRIN) MRI trial standards17 and the Ameri-
can College of Radiology Breast MRI Accreditation Program
standards. This study was approved by the respective institu-
tionalreviewboardofSeoulNationalUniversityHospital,Sam-
sungMedicalCenter,AsanMedicalCenter,SeoulStMary'sHos-
pital, Severance Hospital, and Seoul National University
Bundang Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
The inclusion criteria were as follows: women 20 years or
older and 50 years or younger at the initial diagnosis of ductal
carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer; women whose fi-
nalmarginswerenegative,definedasnoinkontumorandwho
had finished radiotherapy at least 6 months before the study;
womenwithnohistoryofabreastbiopsywithin6monthsprior
to the study; women who had not had contralateral mastec-
tomies;womenwhohadnoknownmetastaticdisease;women
who were not pregnant or lactating; women who had no
present signs or symptoms of breast cancer; women with no
contraindications to MRI examinations; and women with
no prior breast MRI, breast ultrasonography, or mammogra-
phy screenings within 6 months before the study. Radio-
therapy and systemic treatment protocol was standardized
across the academic centers according to the National Com-
prehensive Cancer Network guidelines.7 Annual mammogra-
phy, breast ultrasonography, and breast MRI were performed
for both conserved and contralateral breasts during the 3-year
study period—from December 1, 2010, to January 31, 2016—
with a maximum interval of 2 months between each imaging
modality. Clinical breast examinations were performed every
6 months.5,6 Two-view mammograms, including mediolat-
eral oblique and craniocaudal view, were performed using full-
field digital mammography units. Whole-breast screening ul-
trasonography was performed by radiologists (N.C., B.-K.H.,
Key Points
Question What are the screening yield and tumor characteristics
detected by combined mammography and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography in women diagnosed at 50 years
or younger who underwent breast conservation and radiotherapy
for breast cancer?
Findings In this multicenter comparison study of 754 women,
MRI screening detected 3.8 additional cancers and
ultrasonography detected 2.4 additional cancers, most of which
were stage 0 or stage 1, per 1000 women and increased sensitivity
over mammography alone.
Meaning In younger women who had undergone breast
conservation therapy, the addition of MRI screening or
ultrasonography to mammography can be considered.

 M.S.B., E.S.K., E.Y.C., S.H.K., B.J.K., E.-K.K., H.J.M., S.M.K.,
H.H.K., and W.K.M.). Breast MRI was performed using a 1.5-T
or 3.0-T scanner with a dedicated breast coil according to pre-
viously detailed protocols.18
Image Interpretation and Outcome Measures
Radiologists with at least 5 years of breast MRI experience at
each site and blinded to the results of the other studies (N.C.,
B.-K.H., M.S.B., E.S.K., E.Y.C., S.H.K., B.J.K., E.-K.K., H.J.M.,
S.M.K., H.H.K., and W.K.M.) interpreted mammography,
ultrasonography, and MRI data and recorded the American
College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Sys-
tem (BI-RADS) final assessment category and likelihood of
malignancy score (score range, 0%-100%; higher scores indi-
cate higher possibility of malignancy).19 Although radiolo-
gists were blinded to the other modality images, previous
images were allowed to be compared within the same
imaging modality; thus, preoperative MRIs were compared
for interpretation of MRIs. Then, a site investigator (N.C.,
B.-K.H., M.S.B., E.S.K., E.Y.C., S.H.K., B.J.K., E.-K.K., H.J.M.,
S.M.K., H.H.K., or W.K.M.), a breast radiologist who did not
participate in the initial interpretation of images, recorded a
combined category after reviewing both mammogram and
ultrasonogram, mammogram and MRI, and a combination of
the 3 modalities, respectively. A clinical recommendation
was made on the basis of combined interpretations. For
lesions with BI-RADS final assessment category 4 or more,
image-guided needle biopsy was performed. Guidance
modality was determined at the discretion of the radiolo-
gists who interpreted images. The MRI-guided, vacuum-
assisted biopsy was performed for lesions identified on MRI
alone. Determination of cancer was made on the basis of the
biopsy or imaging follow-up results within 365 days after the
imaging examinations. Cancer detection rate (CDR), sensitiv-
ity, specificity, recall rate, positive predictive value for recall
(PPV1), short-term follow-up rate, biopsy rate, PPV for biopsy
(PPV3), and diagnostic accuracy assessed by area under the
(receiver operating characteristic) curve (AUC) were calcu-
lated for each imaging modality and its respective
combinations.20 The CDR was defined as the number of
detected cancers per 1000 examinations. A negative exami-
nation result was defined as a BI-RADS category of 1 or 2, and
a positive examination result was defined as a BI-RADS cat-
egory of 3, 4A, 4B, 4C, or 5. An interval cancer was defined as
a breast cancer diagnosed after the last negative examina-
tion result because of clinical symptoms but before the next
scheduled examination.
Statistical Analysis
We compared screening outcomes between each image
modality and its combinations using generalized estimating
equations, where a participant was defined as a cluster, or
McNemar test. The independence working correlation
structure was used for PPV or negative predictive value, and
the exchangable correlation structure was used for the other
outcomes in the generalized estimating equation. The AUCs
were estimated and compared using the method accounting
for the correlations.21 The 95% CIs of CDR, specificity, recall
rate, PPV1, short-term follow-up, and biopsy rate were esti-
mated considering a participant as a cluster.22 Because the
number of detected or diagnosed cancers was small, exact
CI for sensitivity was estimated by the Wilson score method.
The adjusted P values for multiple testing were calculated
using the Sidak method for each screening outcome. Clini-
copathologic features and treatment data of the initial
breast cancers were also obtained and compared between
the women with and without second breast cancers using
the Fisher exact test. The features showing P < .20 were
included for multivariable logistic regression analysis to
identify independent factors associated with second breast
cancers. The stepwise variable selection method was
applied. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS soft-
ware, version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc). A 2-sided P < .05 was
considered to indicate a significant difference, and CIs are
shown at the 95% confidence level.
Results
Participant Characteristics
From December 1, 2010, through January 31, 2016, a total of
754 eligible women participated in the study. Of these women,
2 (0.3%) did not undergo mammography but underwent ul-
trasonography and MRI in the first round, completed the sec-
ond and third rounds, and were included for the second-year
and third-year analyses but excluded from the first-year analy-
sis(Figure).Systemicmetastasiswasfoundin7women(0.9%),
and they were excluded from the study. No MRI examination
results were excluded because of poor image quality. Thus, a
total of 754 women with reference standards completed 2065
screenings: 752 screenings in the first year, 689 in the second
year, and 624 in the third year (Table 1). Six hundred ninety-
three participants (91.9%) underwent a preoperative MRI.
Sixty-one women (8.1%) underwent genetic testing and 17
(2.3%) were found to be BRCA mutation carriers, and 2 of the
17 had second breast cancers. Characteristics of the study co-
hort, including clinicopathologic features and treatment data
of initial breast cancers, can be found in eAppendix in the
Supplement.
Cancer Detection, Interval Cancer Rate,
and Tumor Characteristics
A total of 17 breast cancers were identified in 17 women (2.3%):
12 identified in the first year, 3 in the second year, and 2 in the
third year. The mean time from the initial surgery to the de-
tection of a second breast cancer was 17.8 (range, 6-41) months
(range, 6-41 months). All cancers were detected by 1 of 3
imaging modalities. No cancer was detected on clinical breast
examinations. No cancer was found during the intervals be-
tweenscreeningsandatthe12-monthfollow-upafterthethird-
year interpretation.
Of the 17 women with detected cancers, 10 (58.8%) were
diagnosed with cancer in the ipsilateral breast and 7 (41.2%)
were diagnosed with cancer in the contralateral breast, and 13
(76.5%) were in stage 0 or stage 1. Only 1 cancer (5.9%) had
nodal micrometastasis, and 10 (58.8%) were invasive ductal

 carcinomas with a median (interquartile range) size of 10.5
(14.5) mm. Two cancers (11.8%) were detected by mammog-
raphy alone, 0 by ultrasonography alone, 3 (17.6%) by MRI
alone, 1 (5.9%) by mammogram and MRI, 5 (29.4%) by ultra-
sonography and MRI, and 6 (35.3%) by all 3 imaging modali-
ties (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Two cancers detected by
mammography alone presented with suspicious calcifica-
tions on mammography, but they did not show suspicious en-
hancement on MRI. The clinicopathologic features and treat-
ment data of initial breast cancers in women with recurrent
cancersandthecharacteristicsofthedetectedcancersaresum-
marized in eTable 2 in the Supplement. Most of the detected
cancers (12 [70.6%]) were biologically aggressive hormone re-
ceptor–negative and/or ERBB2/HER2 (OMIM 164870)–
positive tumors.
Incremental Cancer Detection Yield
The overall CDR was 8.2 per 1000 examinations (17 of 2065)
(Table2).TheCDRofmammographywithMRIwashigherthan
that of mammography alone (8.2 vs 4.4 per 1000; P = .003).
The CDR of mammography with ultrasonography was higher
thanthatofmammographyalone(6.8vs4.4per1000;P = .03).
When MRI was added to mammography, 3.8 more can-
cers per 1000 women (95% CI, 2.8-4.9; P = .003) were de-
tected. When ultrasonography was added to mammography,
2.4 more cancers per 1000 women (95% CI, 1.7-3.1; P = .03)
were detected.
Regarding the yield for invasive carcinoma, when MRI was
added to mammography, 2.4 more cancers per 1000 women
were detected (95% CI, 1.5-3.3; P = .03). When ultrasonogra-
phy was added to mammography, 1.5 more cancers per 1000
women were detected (95% CI, 0.9-2.0; P = .12) (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).
Sensitivity, Specificity, and AUC
The sensitivity of mammography with MRI screening (100%
[17 of 17]; 95% CI, 81.6%-100%) was higher than that of
mammography alone (52.9% [9 of 17]; 95% CI, 31.0%-73.8%;
P = .01) (Table 2). However, the sensitivity of a screening
with mammography and ultrasonography (82.4% [14 of 17];
95% CI, 59.0%-93.8%) was not different from that of mam-
mography alone (52.9% [9 of 17]; 95% CI, 31.0%-73.8%;
P = .07).
The specificity of mammography with MRI (87.0% [1781
of 2048]; 95% CI, 85.2%-88.7%) or mammography with ultra-
sonography (87.6% [1794 of 2048]; 95% CI, 85.9%-89.3%) was
lowerthanthatofmammographyalone(96.0%[1966of2048];
95% CI, 94.9%-97.1%; P < .001 vs P < .001) (Table 2).
The AUC increased from 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65-0.93) to 0.99
(95% CI, 0.94-1.00) (P = .01) when MRI was added to mam-
mography; however, the AUC was not significantly differ-
ently increased from 0.79 (95% CI, 0.65-0.93) to 0.92 (95% CI,
0.84-1.00) (P = .18) when ultrasonography was added to mam-
mography (Table 2).
Recall, Biopsy, and Short-term Follow-up Rates
After the addition of MRI to mammography, there was an in-
crease in the recall rate from 4.4% (91 of 2065; 95% CI, 3.3%-
5.5%) to 13.8% (284 of 2065; 95% CI, 12.0%-15.5%; P < .001),
in the biopsy rate from 0.5% (11 of 2065; 95% CI, 0.2%-0.8%)
to 2.7% (56 of 2065; 95% CI, 2.0%-3.4%; P < .001), and in the
short-term follow-up rate from 3.6% (75 of 2065; 95% CI, 2.6%-
4.7%) to 10.2% (210 of 2065; 95% CI, 8.6%-11.8%; P < .001)
(Table 2). After the addition of ultrasonography to mammog-
raphy,therecallrate,biopsyrate,andshort-termfollow-uprate
(each of which has P < .001) also increased (Table 2).
PPV for Recall and Biopsy
The PPV1 for the recall was not different after the addition of
MRI (9.9% [9 of 91]; 95% CI, 3.6%-16.2% vs 6.0% [17 of 284];
95% CI, 3.2%-8.8%; P = .09), although the PPV1 was signifi-
cantly decreased when ultrasonography was added to mam-
mography alone (9.9% [9 of 91]; 95% CI, 3.6%-16.2% vs 5.2%
[14 of 268]; 95% CI, 2.5%-7.9%; P = .007). The PPV3 for bi-
opsy decreased after the addition of MRI (72.7% [8 of 11]; 95%
CI, 43.4%-90.3% vs 28.6% [16 of 56]; 95% CI, 18.4%-41.5%;

 mammography alone. Most detected cancers (13 of 17 [76.5%])
were stage 0 or stage 1, and all but 1 invasive cancer was node
negative. Only 1 cancer was stage IIB, which was comparable
to the results of other screening MRI studies performed for
high-riskwomen.23-27Nocancerwasdetectedonclinicalbreast
examinations. In addition, no interval cancer was found dur-
ing the study period, contrary to the reported 7.5 interval can-
cers per 1000 women that were detected in a mammography
screening study in women younger than 50 years with a per-
sonal history of breast cancer.8 A reduction in biologically ag-
gressive,intervalbreastcancerratesandadvanced-stagebreast
cancer rates can be a useful intermediate surrogate measure
for screening benefits.28,29
Regarding the overall CDR, our rate of 8.2 per 1000 ex-
aminations (17 of 2065) is lower than the CDR range of 16 to
30 per 1000 for women who have familial breast cancer or are
BRCA mutation carriers.23-27 The relatively lower CDR in this
study might be because 91.9% (693 of 754) of our participants
had undergone preoperative MRI that had been reported to be
associated with a reduced second breast cancer incidence in
contralateral breasts.30 In addition, women at the highest risk
of recurrence (whose final margins were positive or who did
notreceiveradiotherapy)wereexcludedfromthestudy.Inpre-
vious retrospective studies carried out in single center for
women with a personal history of breast cancers, a highly se-
lected population with negative mammography or non-
blindedinterpretationofmammographyresultsandMRImight
have overestimated CDR for MRI screenings.
OneofthemajordrawbacksofMRIscreeningisitshighfalse-
positiverateand,asaresult,theassociatedcostsandmorbidity.
Compared with mammography alone, the addition of MRI in-
creasedtherecallrate(from4.4%to13.8%;P < .001),biopsyrate
(from0.5%to2.7%;P < .001),andshort-termfollow-uprate(from
3.6%to10.2%;P < .001),whichledtodecreasedspecificity(from
96%to87%;P < .001).However,47.1%(8of17)ofcancersmight
have been missed with mammography alone. Considering the
harmscausedbyfalse-negativefindings,thefalse-positivefind-
ingscausedbyMRIscreeningexaminationsmightbewithinac-
ceptable ranges if informed women choose them.31
Theadditionofultrasonographytomammographyscreen-
ing tended to increase sensitivity of the screening from 52.9%
(9 of 17) to 82.4% (14 of 17); however, this difference was not
significant at P = . 07. Therefore, when women who received
BCTat50yearsoryounger,especiallythosewithdensebreasts,
are unable to undergo MRI screenings, ultrasonography might
be considered.15,32

tion carriers, and 2 of these women had second breast cancers,
which may be an overestimated CDR in women after BCT. The
NationalComprehensiveCancerNetworkrecommendsgenetic
counseling for women 45 years or younger with a personal his-
tory of breast cancer.35 However, in this study, only 8.1% (61 of
754)ofwomenunderwentgenetictestingbeforemakingatreat-
mentdecision.Last,only17recurrentbreastcancerswerediag-
nosed during the study period. The small number of detected
cancers caused wide 95% CIs; thus, precise estimate for sensi-
tivity was difficult.
Conclusions
This study suggests that the addition of MRI to mammogra-
physcreeningimprovedthedetectionofearly-stagebreastcan-
cersatacceptablespecificityinwomenwhohadBCTat50years
or younger. Our study results can be used not only to inform
patient and clinician decision making regarding the best meth-
ods of screening after BCT but also to develop more person-
alized screening guidelines and recommendations for women
at increased risk for breast cancer.
