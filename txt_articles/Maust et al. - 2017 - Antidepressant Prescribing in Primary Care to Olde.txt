Abstract
Objective—To determine whether older adults newly prescribed an antidepressant for depression 
by their primary care physician but found to not have MDD have similar levels of distress 
compared to those prescribed an antidepressant with MDD.
Methods—This analysis uses a convenience sample of participants (n=231) newly prescribed an 
antidepressant in the Treatment Initiation and Participation (TIP) program, a randomized 
controlled trial to improve antidepressant adherence and depression outcomes in older adults 
(≥55). After determining the proportion with and without MDD (using Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV [SCID]), we compared groups on demographic, clinical, and psychosocial 
characteristics, including SF-12 physical and mental component summaries (PCS and MCS). We 
used logistic regression to test the association of these characteristics and antidepressant use 
without MDD.
Results—57% (n=131) of participants did not have MDD. Compared to the MDD group, the 
non-MDD group was older (69.4 years [standard deviation 9.1] v. 64.7 [6.5], p<.001) and a larger 
proportion was white (82% v. 56%, p<.001). The non-MDD group reported better physical and 
emotional well-being (PCS 43.4 v. 39.9, p=.03; MCS 40.2 v. 30.5, p<.001). In the final regression 
model, white race (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.11, 95% CI=1.15–8.43, p=.03) and better mental 
well-being on the MCS (AOR=1.16, CI=1.10–1.22, p<.001) were associated with antidepressant 
use without MDD.
Conclusions—Older adults prescribed antidepressants without MDD do not report distress 
similar to those with MDD who receive antidepressants. Given the continued emphasis on 
screening for depression in primary care, it is important to consider the potential for over-
treatment.

 INTRODUCTION
Depression among older adults has been the subject of a significant amount of research and 
education over the past twenty years. Initially, work highlighted that depression often went 
unrecognized in typical care settings and, when diagnosed, was often undertreated (1). 
Significant subsequent efforts went into improving detection and treatment of depression in 
primary care (2, 3), since few older adults have access to specialty mental health care. While 
a variety of models have been studied, collaborative care has been particularly effective (4). 
However, implementation of these models has lagged far behind their evidence base, largely 
due to the lack of sustainable reimbursement models (5). While the most effective models of 
depression care go unimplemented, use of antidepressants continues to increase (6), with use 
pervasive among older adults seen in outpatient care (7).
Recent analyses of nationally-representative surveys have suggested extensive use of 
antidepressants without a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) or significant 
depressive symptoms (8, 9). In addition, analyses of national claims data from the Veterans 
Affairs system (10) and a private insurance claims database (11) have also suggested that a 
significant proportion of antidepressant use occurs without a psychiatric diagnosis. However, 
these survey and administrative data do not contain information about a patient’s clinical 
status at the time of the prescription. What appears to be antidepressant use without a 
psychiatric indication could be due to the survey format (e.g., limited space to list diagnoses) 
or clinician oversight (e.g., not adding MDD as a billing diagnosis although the provider 
recognized it as present). However, in another study where patients were contacted by 
telephone shortly after a new antidepressant was prescribed, the majority had depressive 
symptoms below what would suggest the presence of MDD (12). Finally, a recent analysis 
of participants in the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Study followed for 4 survey 
waves from 1981–2005 found that, among antidepressant users in the final wave, 69% did 
not currently and had never met criteria for MDD based on their survey assessments over the 
preceding 2 decades. Even a recent analysis arguing that antidepressant use without MDD is 
not a significant problem found that, among those ≥65 and newly-prescribed an 
antidepressant, 26% had symptoms below the threshold that suggests MDD (13).
Taken together, these analyses suggest that, conservatively, at least one quarter of 
antidepressant use occurs in the absence of significant depressive symptoms. These patients 
lack the condition for which an antidepressant might benefit them, yet they are still subject 
to the side effects and adverse events (14–16) along with the unnecessary cost and risks of 
polypharmacy. However, a key limitation of each study is the lack of information about the 
prescriber’s rationale. It may be that providers are responding to some other psychological 
or emotional distress that is not being captured by a standard inventory of depressive 
symptoms. In addition, some amount of antidepressant use may have been off-label for 
reasons such as insomnia or neuropathic pain, which is not uncommon (17) and is arguably 
appropriate.
In this analysis, we use data from the Treatment Initiation and Participation Program (TIP) 
study, an NIH-sponsored, randomized controlled trial of an intervention to improve 
antidepressant adherence and depression outcomes in older adults. This study recruited older

 adults from primary care practices in New York and Michigan that had been newly-
prescribed an antidepressant that, based on chart review, was prescribed by the provider for 
the purpose of treating depression. However, based on the baseline study assessment, a 
significant proportion was found to not have MDD. We hypothesized that a similar burden of 
both medical illness and psychosocial distress would be associated with antidepressant 
receipt without a diagnosis of MDD, suggesting that providers are prescribing an 
antidepressant in response to patient distress that may not precisely fit the constellation of 
symptoms required for a diagnosis of MDD. In addition, based on prior work demonstrating 
an association between demographic characteristics and antidepressant use absent a 
diagnosis (8, 11, 18), we hypothesized that prescribing without MDD would be associated 
with female gender, older age, and white race.
METHODS
Sample
The study population were participants in the Treatment Initiation and Participation Program 
(TIP) study, an NIH-sponsored randomized controlled trial (R01 MH087562 [PI: Dr. Y] & 
R01 MH087557 [PI: Dr. Z]). The study was completed at three primary care practice sites: 
one in New York City and two in southeastern Michigan. Adults ≥55 who received a new 
antidepressant prescription for depression (e.g., had not been on an antidepressant during the 
previous 6 months) were eligible. Participants were identified by physician referral as well 
as chart review, with chart review completed for all patients to confirm that the 
antidepressant was prescribed for depression rather than another reason (e.g., neuropathy or 
insomnia; patients prescribed an antidepressant for both depression and a comorbid 
condition were eligible). Older adults meeting any of the following criteria were excluded: 
1) presence/history of psychotic or bipolar disorder; 2) suicidal intent or plan in the 
immediate future; 3) MMSE<24; 4) alcohol or substance dependence (see Consort diagram 
in eFigure 1). The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Weill Cornell 
Medical College and the University of Michigan Medical School. Participants were 
randomized to the TIP intervention or treatment as usual, with research assessments 
conducted at study entry and multiple time periods out to 24 weeks. This analysis uses only 
baseline data collected at study entry and includes data from all participants, regardless of 
whether randomized to the intervention or treatment as usual.
Baseline evaluations with study participants were conducted by research assistants from 
March 6, 2011 to January 9, 2015 and were conducted within 10 days of their being 
prescribed an antidepressant by their primary care provider. The Structured Clinical 
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) was conducted by research staff to establish the presence of a 
depressive disorder and to screen for the exclusion criteria. The SCID data were reviewed by 
a clinical psychologist to establish the final diagnosis of major, minor, or no depressive 
disorder. Minor depression, as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), is two to four symptoms of depression for ≥2 weeks of 
duration, at least one of which is depressed mood or anhedonia. To assess the burden of 
depressive symptoms, each participant completed the Patient Health Questionnaire 
depression scale (PHQ-9; range 0–27 with higher score indicating more depressive

 symptoms) (19) and the 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS; range 0–75 
with higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms) (20).
Participant Characteristics
This analysis uses demographic and clinical covariates from the baseline assessment shown 
to influence clinicians’ assessment of MDD (e.g., race, gender, and comorbidity (21, 22)). 
The primary intervention study, given its goal of improving antidepressant treatment 
initiation and participation, included a variety of other measures to assess psychosocial 
features that may influence perceived need for or engagement in treatment. From among 
these additional measures, we selected those measures that might capture distress as 
perceived by a clinician.
Demographic variables included age, gender, race/ethnicity, living alone or with others, and 
education.
Clinical variables included: the Chronic Disease Score, a measure of medical comorbidity 
derived from prescription medications (23); the SF-12 physical component score (PCS), a 
measure of the participant’s perception of overall physical well-being (range 0–100, 
population mean 50 with lower score indicating worse perceived well-being) (24); the 
Cornell Services Index, which captures service utilization (specifically acute care 
[emergency department and inpatient admission], outpatient medical care, and other support 
services [e.g., home health aide, home meal delivery]) over the prior 90 days (25); self-
reported history of prior antidepressant use; and time the participant reported they spent in 
discussion with provider about the newly-prescribed antidepressant.
Psychosocial variables included: the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems (IIP), which 
measures distress arising from interpersonal problems (10 items, total range 0–40; higher 
score indicating more difficulty relating to others) (26); Anxiety Sensitivity Index-Revised 
(ASI-R), specifically the subscales pertaining to beliefs and fears about somatic sensations, 
as these beliefs would possibly influence antidepressant adherence (16 of 36 items, total 
range 0–80; higher score indicating more fear about anxiety symptoms) (27); perceived 
need, while was the response to: “In the past month have you had severe enough personal, 
emotional, behavior, or mental problems that you needed help with?” (28); Duke Social 
Support Index, to measure perceived support and understanding from family and friends (8 
items, total range 7–21; lower score indicates less perceived support) (29); Beck 
Hopelessness Scale (10 items, total range 0–10; higher score suggests more hopelessness) 
(30); General Self-Efficacy Scale, a measure of perceived ability to cope with problems in 
life (10 items, total range 10–40; lower score indicates lower rating of self-efficacy) (31); 
and SF-12 mental component score (MCS), a measure of the participant’s perception of 
overall emotional well-being (range 0–100, population mean 50) (24).
Statistical Methods
A total of 231 participants completed the baseline assessment. For this analysis, patients 
diagnosed with MDD (n=100) were compared to those without MDD (n=131; 63 with minor 
depression, 68 with symptoms below the threshold for minor depression). The patients 
without MDD were grouped together as the evidence of efficacy for antidepressants in minor

 depression is limited (32, 33). Groups were initially compared on the characteristics 
described above using a t-test for continuous variables and chi-square test for categorical 
variables. Then, we used multivariable logistic regression to test the association of patient 
characteristics with the outcome of interest (0=antidepressant with diagnosis of MDD v. 
1=antidepressant without diagnosis of MDD). This model adjusted for all demographic 
characteristics and site, as well as the clinical and psychosocial characteristics significant at 
p<0.10 in bivariate analysis. As a sensitivity analysis of our decision to group all patients 
without MDD together, we performed a multinomial regression comparing the outcomes of 
no depression, minor depression, and MDD. For final results, a p-value of <0.05 was used as 
the level of statistical significance.
RESULTS
Baseline participant characteristics are in Table 1 (characteristics by site are presented in 
eTable 1); 131 of 231 (57%) did not have MDD, while 100 (43%) did. Those without MDD 
had significantly lower mean scores on the PHQ-9 and HDRS than counterparts with MDD. 
Among those prescribed an antidepressant but without a diagnosis of MDD, participants 
were older and disproportionately white; there was no association with gender.
While participants did not vary by burden of chronic disease, the non-MDD group reported 
slightly better perceived physical well-being. They also reported having fewer outpatient 
medical visits as well as fewer support services. Those prescribed antidepressants but 
without MDD had better scores on every psychosocial measure except the Perceived Need 
item.
Prior to performing the regression model, a correlation matrix was performed using the 
psychosocial variables, given their strong association with the presence of MDD. As the 
single psychosocial variable most closely correlated with the others, the SF-12 MCS was 
chosen for the regression. In the final model (Table 2), the only characteristics significantly 
associated with antidepressant prescribing without an MDD diagnosis were being white 
(OR=3.11, CI=1.15–8.43, p=.03) and reporting better emotional well-being (OR=1.16, 
CI=1.10–1.22, p<.001). In the sensitivity model, patients with minor depression most closely 
resembled those patients with no depressive symptoms, confirming our a priori grouping 
decision.
DISCUSSION
In this study of older adults newly prescribed an antidepressant to treat depression, the 
majority of patients did not meet criteria for MDD; 29% did not even meet criteria for minor 
depression. Those prescribed an antidepressant in the absence of MDD were older and more 
likely to be white. However, rather than reporting equivalent distress to the MDD group, 
those without MDD generally reported better health and well-being on all measures. Other 
than race, the one significant factor in the final regression was emotional well-being—those 
prescribed antidepressants without a MDD diagnosis reported better well-being, contrary to 
our hypothesis.

 The proportion of prescribing without a depression diagnosis was less than the 72.7% 
described by Mojtabai and Olfson in their NAMCS analysis (8), yet higher than the 26% 
found by Simon et al. (13), which is likely a function of the respective data sources. 
NAMCS limits the number of visit diagnoses reported to just 3, so there may be visits for 
MDD occurring that do not get captured in NAMCS because MDD is in a lower position on 
the problem list. In contrast, the Simon et al. analysis uses data from health systems 
participating in the Mental Health Research Network, limited to patients that received a 
baseline PHQ-9. It would be expected that the sensitivity and specificity of depression 
treatment in such settings might be better than average. Our results are consistent with 
Wiechers et al.’s analysis of a commercial claims database, which found that 52% of 
antidepressant use was absent a psychiatric diagnosis (11).
We hypothesized that the non-MDD group would be high utilizers and report levels of 
psychosocial distress similar to those with MDD. This would be consistent with literature 
suggesting that older adults experience depression differently than younger counterparts—
reporting feelings of hopelessness and social isolation rather than sadness (34–36)—in 
which case providers in this study were perhaps appropriately responding by prescribing 
antidepressants. However, this appears to not have been the case: based on the SF-12 MCS, 
which was included as the representative psychosocial variable in the final model, the group 
without MDD reported significantly better well-being.
While age was associated with the presence of MDD in the initial analysis, it was not 
significant in the final model. It may be that, while age influences recognition of MDD when 
comparing younger to older adults, this age effect is attenuated specifically within an older 
population. There was no association with gender, contrary to our hypothesis. The 
association of white race with antidepressant treatment without MDD may be the 
unanticipated but logical consequence of white older adults being both more likely to receive 
care for depression (37) and more likely to find antidepressants acceptable than other racial 
and ethnic groups (38).
What exactly is driving this antidepressant use? It is possible that providers (correctly) did 
not believe MDD was present, but chose to prescribe the antidepressant for subsyndromal 
symptoms. There is substantial evidence that such symptoms in older adults have a 
significant impact on function, mortality, and cost (39–41). There is not, however, evidence 
that antidepressants are beneficial for these symptoms (32, 33, 42). Perhaps this is a case of 
the “worried well”, where antidepressant use is prompted more by concern about depression 
rather than the actual presence of the disorder. The threshold for prescribing may also be 
getting lower, as changing public attitudes toward antidepressant use and mental illness as 
well as direct to consumer advertising may mean that older patients are more open to trying 
an antidepressant (43, 44). Lastly, it may simply be a case of incorrect diagnosis, given the 
difficulty of accurately diagnosing late-life depression in primary care settings (45). While 
the PHQ-9 scores of those without MDD were not insignificant (mean 8.9 among the group 
without MDD), comorbid conditions in older adults may lead to elevated PHQ-9 scores for 
somatic symptoms such as low energy or poor sleep, while the cardinal features of 
anhedonia or depressed mood are absent.

 Our analysis has several limitations. First, the generalizability may be limited as the study 
was conducted in just 3 primary care practices. However, as noted above, the proportion of 
antidepressant use without MDD is consistent with other analyses of national data and the 
clinical sites serve a diverse population of patients. Second, there is no information as to the 
provider’s thought process at the time of prescription, though it was established by chart 
review that it was meant to treat depression. Third, the baseline assessment may have been 
completed as many as 10 days after the prescription, and thus the patient may have changed 
clinically since seen by the provider. However, given the timespan over which 
antidepressants work, it is unlikely that there would have been a significant reduction in the 
burden of depressive symptoms within, at most, 10 days.
This analysis of older adults prescribed antidepressants for depression confirms what other 
data sources have suggested: a significant amount of antidepressant use meant to treat 
depression is occurring without the MDD diagnosis that warrants pharmacotherapy. The 
extent of inappropriate use is especially concerning given the emphasis on screening for 
depression in primary care, which is reimbursed by Medicare and required as a quality 
measure for Medicare accountable care organizations (46). In a meta-analysis of 
identification of depression in primary care, based on the prevalence of depression in 
primary care and the sensitivity and specificity of providers’ ability to diagnose MDD, 
Mitchell et al. found that misidentification of depression outnumbers missed cases (45). 
Therefore, while screening may be critical to detect undiagnosed MDD, the potential for 
increased overdiagnosis and overtreatment must be acknowledged. Older patients 
misidentified as having MDD lack the condition for which an antidepressant might benefit 
them, though they are still subject to the potential side effects, adverse events, and risks of 
polypharmacy (14–16), along with the unnecessary cost.
CONCLUSIONS
Depression has a significant adverse impact on older adults and magnifies the morbidity 
associated with other chronic medical illness. While improving the recognition and 
treatment of depression in primary care has been an important focus of research and policy, 
it is important to recognize the potential for over-treatment. While providers and the public 
increasingly recognize depression as a medical problem meriting treatment, they should be 
aware that, whereas antidepressants are beneficial for MDD, they are not helpful for lower 
levels of depressive symptoms, while the potential side effects and costs remain. Primary 
care continues to be both the de facto and preferred mental health treatment setting for older 
adults (7, 47), while collaborative care continues to be the standard for addressing 
depression in primary care (48). It is critical to consider how such a model might support 
primary care providers to reduce both undertreatment and overtreatment of depression.
