Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Epidemiological studies suggest a role for
Coxsackievirus B (CVB) serotypes in the pathogenesis of
type 1 diabetes, but their actual contribution remains elu-
sive. In the present study, we have produced a CVB1
vaccine to test whether vaccination against CVBs can
prevent virus-induced diabetes in an experimental model.
Methods NOD and SOCS1-tg mice were vaccinated three
times with either a formalin-fixed non-adjuvanted CVB1 vac-
cine or a buffer control. Serum was collected for measurement
of neutralising antibodies using a virus neutralisation assay.
Vaccinated and buffer-treated mice were infected with CVB1.
Viraemia and viral replication in the pancreas were measured
using standard plaque assay and PCR. The development of
diabetes was monitored by blood glucose measurements.
Histological analysis and immunostaining for viral capsid
protein 1 (VP1), insulin and glucagon in formalin-fixed
paraffin embedded pancreas was performed.
Results The CVB1 vaccine induced strong neutralising
antibody responses and protected against viraemia and
the dissemination of virus to the pancreas in both NOD
mice (n = 8) and SOCS1-tg mice (n = 7). Conversely,
100% of the buffer-treated NOD and SOCS1-tg mice were
viraemic on day 3 post infection. Furthermore, half (3/6)
of the buffer-treated SOCS1-tg mice developed diabetes
upon infection with CVB1, with a loss of the insulin-
positive beta cells and damage to the exocrine pancreas.
In contrast, all (7/7) vaccinated SOCS1-tg mice were
protected from virus-induced diabetes and showed no
signs of beta cell loss or pancreas destruction (p < 0.05).
Conclusions/Interpretation CVB1 vaccine can efficiently
protect against both CVB1 infection and CVB1-induced
diabetes. This preclinical proof of concept study provides
a base for further studies aimed at developing a vaccine for
use in elucidating the role of enteroviruses in human type 1
diabetes.

Introduction
Type 1 diabetes is increasing globally, however, the mecha-
nisms that initiate the onset of disease remain unknown.
Environmental factors that have been implicated include en-
terovirus infections, in particular Coxsackievirus B (CVB) se-
rotypes [1, 2]. CVBs are common RNA viruses encompassing

 six serotypes; CVB1–6. Usually infections are mild or asymp-
tomatic, however, some lead to severe, potentially fatal dis-
eases including aseptic meningitis and myocarditis.
Epidemiological studies exist documenting associations be-
tween CVBs and type 1 diabetes, including the presence of
virus in the pancreas of individuals recently diagnosed with
type 1 diabetes and increased occurrence of infection prior to
islet antibody appearance and onset of diabetes [1–3].
Furthermore, CVBs can induce hyperglycaemia in animal
models [4, 5]. Together, these findings support the hypothesis
that CVBs contribute to the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes.
Despite the aforementioned circumstantial evidence, it is
possible that the association between CVBs and type 1 diabe-
tes is not causal and results from yet unidentified confounding
factors. Vaccine studies in prospective birth cohorts of genet-
ically susceptible children may help elucidate the role of
CVBs in type 1 diabetes, however, no commercially available
CVB vaccines currently exist [2]. We previously demonstrat-
ed that an inactivated, non-adjuvanted CVB1 vaccine was
well tolerated in mice, was highly efficacious against CVB1
infection and did not accelerate diabetes in NOD mice [6, 7].
Whether this vaccine can prevent CVB1-induced diabetes is
unknown.
SOCS1-tg mice express the suppressor of cytokine
signalling-1 in beta cells, resulting in their inability to respond
to interferons, thus leaving beta cells susceptible to CVB in-
fection, destruction and subsequently virus-induced diabetes
[4]. Due to its robustness and quick development of virus-
induced diabetes, the SOCS1-tg mouse model was used to
assess the ability of a CVB1 vaccine to prevent CVB1 induced
diabetes, providing an important biological proof of concept
study examining CVB vaccine efficacy in the context of type
1 diabetes.
Methods
Animal husbandry and monitoring of animal health NOD
mice and SOCS1-tg mice on a NOD background (both from
in-house breeding) were housed in specific pathogen-free con-
ditions at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. Ethics
approval was granted for all experiments by the local ethics
committee and were conducted in accordance with the NIH
Principles of Laboratory Animal Care and national laws in
Sweden. Extended health monitoring of mice was performed.
Additional information is provided in the ESM Methods:
Animals, together with details of primers used for SOCS1-tg
mouse genotyping (ESM Table 1).
Virus and vaccine production A CVB1 field isolate (CVB1-
V200; [3]), was propagated in Vero cells (ECACC no.
84113001; mycoplasma negative), purified and then formalin
inactivated for 3 days at 37°C to produce CVB1 vaccine. See
ESM Methods: Vaccine production and Hankaniemi et al [7]
for more details. Mice were infected with CVB1-10796 (prop-
agated in HeLa cells, originally obtained from R Glas,
Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, mycoplasma
negative).
Vaccinations Male and female age-matched NOD and
SOCS1-tg mice (4–7 weeks old) were randomly assigned to
groups and vaccinated on days 0, 14 and 28 with non-
adjuvanted vaccine containing 1.8 μg protein (n = 8 and
n = 7, respectively) or mock-vaccinated with vaccine buffer
(M199-0.1% Tween80 (vol./vol.), 150 μl, n = 6 for NOD and
for SOCS1-tg mice) by interscapular injection [6, 7]. Serum
was collected before vaccinations and infection (day 35) by
tail bleeding (experimental timeline displayed in Fig. 1a). The
study was not blinded to the experimenter.
Infections Mice were challenged with 106 plaque forming
units (PFU) CVB1-10796 (diluted in serum-free RPMI to a
final volume of 200 μl, administered by intraperitoneal injec-
tion, with the dose carefully optimised, data not shown) on
day 35. Blood samples were collected on day 3 post infection
(p.i.; 1:1 ratio with 12 mmol EDTA). NOD mice were killed
on day 3 p.i. and pancreases saved for virus quantification and
histological analysis. SOCS1-tg mice were monitored until
diabetes development or day 21 p.i. and pancreases saved
for histological analysis.
Monitoring of blood glucose and diabetes development
Blood glucose was measured in blood obtained from the
tail-vein with a Bayer Contour XT blood glucose meter
(Bayer, Basel, Switzerland) and a glucose concentration
>18 mmol/l, or two consecutive measurements between
13 and 18 mmol/l were used to define diabetes and dia-
betic mice were killed.
Neutralising antibody detection Neutralising antibody titres
were determined by standard virus plaque reduction assay in
green monkey kidney (GMK) cells (National Institute for
Health and Welfare, Finland; mycoplasma negative) [3].
Plaque number reduction ≥80% compared with untreated
virus suspension was considered positive. The detection limit
of the assay was a fourfold dilution (1:4), and positivity cut-off
for serum samples was set to ≥1:16.
Virus titration Pancreases were homogenised and lytic virus
quantified in either blood or pancreas by standard plaque as-
say in GMK cells. Viral titres are expressed as PFU/g of tissue
or ml of blood. See ESM Methods: Virus titration and tissue
homogenisation for more details.
PCR analysis Enterovirus specific real-time PCR was per-
formed using RNA extracted from blood samples; see ESM

details. Primers are shown in ESM Table 2.
Histological analysis and immunohistochemistry
Histological analysis and immunohistochemistry of pancreas
samples with viral capsid protein 1 (VP1), insulin and gluca-
gon were carried out as in Flodström et al and Larsson et al ([4,
6]; ESM Methods: Immunohistochemistry and antibodies).
Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were executed using
Prism 5 software (GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA). PCR and
VP1 immunohistochemistry data were analysed by χ2 tests.
Plaque assay virus titrations were analysed by Mann–Whitney
U test. Neutralising antibody data was analysed by one-way
ANOVA. Diabetes incidence was analysed by log rank
Mantel–Cox test. Data are expressed as the mean ± SD. A p
value ≤0.05 was regarded statistically significant.
Results
CVB1 vaccine is well tolerated and is highly immunogenic
The newly produced CVB1 vaccine was well tolerated by
NOD mice with no adverse effects on weight or blood glucose
(ESM Fig. 1a–c). Furthermore, the vaccine was highly immu-
nogenic and vaccinated mice produced CVB1 neutralising
antibodies after the primary immunisation, which was aug-
mented after the second immunisation (ESM Fig. 1d).
Serum with a neutralising capacity was not detected in
buffer-treated mice (data not shown).
CVB1 vaccine protects against CVB1 infection in NOD
mice We next examined whether the vaccine protects against
viraemia caused by CVB1 infection and prevents virus repli-
cation in the pancreas on day 3 p.i. All vaccinated mice (8/8)
were protected from viraemia, as determined by RT-PCR and

 plaque assay (Fig. 1b, c). Conversely, all buffer-treated mice
were identified viraemic by plaque assay (Fig. 1c) and 5/6
were positive for CVB1 RNA (Fig. 1b). Similarly, replicating
virus in the pancreas was measured in buffer-treated mice but
not in vaccinated mice (Fig. 1d). Immunohistochemical ana-
lysis using the VP1 antibody further confirmed viral dissem-
ination to the pancreas in all buffer-treated mice (Fig. 1e, g)
but not vaccinated mice (Fig. 1f–g).
CVB1 vaccine protects against virus-induced diabetes
SOCS1-tg mice, which are susceptible to virus-induced diabe-
tes [4], showed no adverse changes in weight and blood glu-
cose after CVB1 vaccination (data not shown). Additionally,
vaccinated SOCS1-tg mice developed a robust antibody re-
sponse (Fig. 2a) similar to that observed in NOD mice
(ESM Fig. 1d). Buffer-treated mice remained consistently
negative for neutralising antibodies (data not shown).

 We next monitored SOCS1-tg mice after CVB1 challenge.
No obvious differences were found in the weight of vaccinat-
ed and buffer-treated mice (Fig. 2b, c). Furthermore, viraemia
measurements on day 3 p.i. revealed no signs of infection in
the vaccinated animals (0/7; Fig. 2d, e). In contrast, all (6/6)
buffer-treated mice were infected as indicated by the detection
of both viral RNA (Fig. 2d) and infective virus by plaque
assay (Fig. 2e).
We also tracked diabetes development in the infected
SOCS1-tg mice until day 21 p.i. As expected, diabetes oc-
curred in the buffer-treated SOCS1-tg mice with 50% (3/6)
developing hyperglycaemia (p < 0.05; Fig. 2f). Pancreatic
exocrine damage was notable in 4/6 mice (Fig. 2g), which
corresponded with diabetes development. Moreover, mice that
developed hyperglycaemia showed glucagon positivity but a
loss of insulin positivity in a number of islets, indicating de-
struction of the insulin-producing beta cells (Fig. 2g). In con-
trast, all seven vaccinated SOCS1-tg mice were protected from
diabetes (Fig. 2h) and showed normal pancreas morphology
on day 21 p.i. with healthy exocrine tissue and intense insulin
and glucagon staining in the islets of Langerhans (Fig. 2h).
Discussion
In the present study, we show that a monovalent, formalin-
inactivated and non-adjuvanted CVB1 vaccine protects
against both acute CVB1 infection and virus-induced diabetes
in a mouse model for virus-induced diabetes. The vaccine
proved to be highly immunogenic, with the antibody titres
produced being greater than those considered to be protective
in other enterovirus vaccines [9] and was well tolerated with
regards to weight and blood glucose. Combined, these results
highlight the potential of enterovirus vaccines in testing the
hypothesis that preventing enterovirus infections attenuates
the risk of type 1 diabetes.
When considering enterovirus vaccine development for
clinical intervention trials, it is pertinent to identify enterovi-
ruses with possible roles in type 1 diabetes pathogenesis.
Large-scale prospective studies including the Type 1
Diabetes Prediction And Prevention Project (DIPP) and The
Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young
(TEDDY) Study [2, 10] are therefore highly important owing
to their potential in the identification of diabetogenic viruses
from clinical samples collected. Moreover, if an enterovirus
vaccine were successfully approved for clinical use, prospec-
tive studies like these would provide excellent opportunities to
test vaccine efficacy in the prevention of type 1 diabetes.
Theoretically, traditional formalin-inactivated vaccines could
include several different enterovirus types. For example, polio
vaccine contains poliovirus 1-3 and recently, a 50-valent rhi-
novirus vaccine (both enteroviruses) had high immunogen-
icity in nonhuman primates [11]. However, the economic
feasibility of commercial vaccine production currently limits
the number of serotypes that can be included in a single vac-
cine. Existing information suggests the importance of CVB
enteroviruses as targets for vaccines to use in type 1 diabetes
prevention trials and future studies should aim to produce a
hexavalent vaccine including all six CVB serotypes [2].
Moreover, this type of vaccine would be valuable in the pre-
vention of other potentially fatal CVB associated diseases,
including myocarditis and aseptic meningitis.
In conclusion, this proof of concept study demonstrates that
a formalin-inactivated CVB vaccine protects against virus-
induced diabetes. This provides a model for future development
of enterovirus vaccines, particularly multivalent vaccines cov-
ering a number of serotypes for testing in clinical trials to ex-
amine their ability to prevent human type 1 diabetes.
