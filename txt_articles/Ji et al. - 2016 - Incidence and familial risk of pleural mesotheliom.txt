ABSTRACT
Familial clustering of pleural mesothelioma was reported previously, but none of the reports
quantified the familial risk of mesothelioma or the association with other cancers. The contributions of
shared environmental or genetic factors to the aggregation of mesothelioma were unknown.
We used a number of Swedish registers, including the Swedish Multigeneration Register and the
Swedish Cancer Register, to examine the familial risk of mesothelioma in offspring. Standardised incidence
ratios (SIRs) were used to calculate the risk. Age standardised incidence rates of mesothelioma were
calculated from the Swedish Cancer Registry.
The incidence of mesothelioma reached its peak rate in 2000 and decreased thereafter. Risk of
mesothelioma was significantly increased when parents or siblings were diagnosed with mesothelioma,
with SIRs of 3.88 (95% CI 1.01–10.04) and 12.37 (95% CI 5.89–22.84), respectively. Mesothelioma was
associated with kidney (SIR 2.13, 95% CI 1.16–3.59) and bladder cancers (SIR 2.09, 95% CI 1.32–3.14) in
siblings. No association was found between spouses.
Family history of mesothelioma, including both parental and sibling history, is an important risk factor
for mesothelioma. Shared genetic factors may contribute to the observed familial clustering of
mesothelioma, but the contribution of shared environmental factors could not be neglected. The
association with kidney and bladder cancers calls for further study to explore the underlying mechanisms.

MESOTHELIOMA
 Introduction
Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a relatively uncommon, aggressive cancer that develops in the pleura, a
thin layer of tissue surrounding the lung [1]. Exposure to asbestos is considered the major cause of
mesothelioma [2], which may account for more than half of the mesothelioma cases in Sweden and may
reach 80% in many other countries [3–6]. It has been estimated that more than 90% of asbestos used in
Sweden was chrysotile [2]. The use of crocidolite has been prohibited in Sweden since 1975 [2] and from
1982 onwards there has been a general prohibition of the use of other types of asbestos [2]. It is thus
interesting to examine whether the incidence of pleural mesothelioma has decreased after the ban of
asbestos, and to examine the interval between any fall in the incidence and the timing of the ban to
estimate the latency period for the development of mesothelioma.
Besides asbestos exposure, erionite is another established risk factor of mesothelioma [7, 8]. In addition,
simian virus 40 [9, 10] may contribute to the development of mesothelioma. Genetic predispositions have
been suggested to play an important role in mesothelioma [11, 12], based on the evidence that only a
small part of the population exposed to asbestos developed mesothelioma and only certain families in
specific villages of Turkey can develop the cancer after exposure to erionite [13]. Familial clustering of
mesothelioma has been reported in some previous studies based on a small number of cases [13–16].
However, to the best of our knowledge, no population-based study has been published to quantity the
familial risk of mesothelioma. Familial aggregation of mesothelioma may be due to shared environmental
factors or genes shared by family members. Some previous studies found that asbestos can be detected in
the homes from the working clothes [14] and wives of asbestos-exposed workers showed an excess rate of
mortality from mesothelioma [17], suggesting the possible contribution of shared environmental factors
on familial aggregation of mesotheliom. In this study, we used a number of Swedish national registers,
including the Multigeneration Register, Swedish Cancer Register, Cause of Death Register, and National
Population and Housing Census Register, to quantify the familial risk of mesothelioma when the
first-degree relatives, including parents and siblings, were diagnosed with mesothelioma and other
cancers, and to disentangle the contribution of the shared environmental factors in the families by
exploring the relative risk of mesothelioma between the spouses, based on the assumption that spouses
could have more intimate contact and thus share more environmental factors than their offspring.
Patients and methods
This cohort study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review Board of Lund University, Sweden in 2013.
This study was carried out by using several nationwide Swedish Registers. The Swedish Cancer Register was
founded in 1958 by the National Board of Health and Welfare and has almost complete nationwide coverage
[18]. According to instructions from the National Board of Health and Welfare, all physicians in Sweden
must report all cases of cancer to the Swedish Cancer Registry; these are called clinical reports. In addition,
pathologists must report every cancer diagnosis to the Swedish Cancer Registry based on surgically removed
tissues, biopsies, cytological specimens, bone marrow aspirates and autopsies; these are called pathology
reports [19–22]. The majority of cancer cases were notified twice from separate reports, guaranteeing a high
accuracy rate at the national level. A four-digit diagnosis code according to the seventh revision of the
International Classification of Diseases (ICD-7) has been used in the Swedish Cancer Register.
The Multigeneration Register [23], which was created and maintained by Statistics Sweden, includes all
children born in Sweden in 1932 and later (maximum 80 years old at 2012), and their siblings and
biological parents. More than 14.4 million individuals (living and deceased) in more than 3.8 million
families are included in the Multigeneration Register. The data on family relationship have an almost
complete coverage, with the exception of some individuals who were born during the 1930s and died
before 1991. Although this small group of offspring with missing links to parents has a negligible effect on
the estimate of familial risk, we limited the present study to offspring whose parents were known in order
to eliminate the possibility of bias. All the individuals from the Multigeneration Register, including both
children and parents, were linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry by using the unique individual national
registration number.
Additional linkages were made to the National Population and Housing Census [24] to obtain information
on individual-level characteristics, such as year of birth, gender and socioeconomic status; to the Cause of
Death Register to identify date of death; and to the Emigration Registry to identify date of emigration. All
linkages were performed using individual national identification numbers, which were replaced with serial
numbers in order to preserve anonymity.
Outcome variable
The Swedish Cancer Register recorded both the sites and histological types of cancer. Pleural mesothelioma
was defined by the ICD-7 code 1622 together with histological diagnosis code 776. Only the first primary
874

 pleural mesothelioma was considered in the present study. The incidence rate was standardised according to
the age distribution of the European population in 2000.
Predictive variable
Familial history of cancer was defined by parental and sibling history separately. Other variables included
gender and age at diagnosis, which was categorised into 5-year groups. The whole follow-up time was
divided into 5-year intervals. Socioeconomic status was recorded according to occupation, divided into six
groups based on the Swedish socioeconomic classification by Statistics Sweden: farmer, blue-collar worker,
white-collar worker, professional, self-employed and nonemployed (economically inactive individuals,
including unemployed individuals and homemakers). Geographical region of residence was divided into
three groups: large city (Stockholm, Gothenburg or Malmö), southern Sweden (excluding the large cities,
all of which lie in Southern Sweden) and northern Sweden in order to adjust for the possible regional
differences in hospitalisation of mesothelioma. Spouses were identified based on common children in the
population aged over 25 years.
Statistical analysis
Person-years at risk (number of persons at risk multiplied by time at risk) were calculated from the start of
follow-up on January 1, 1961 until the diagnosis of cancer or death, emigration, or the end of follow-up
(December 31, 2012). Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated as the ratio of observed to
expected number of cases. SIRs were used to measure the relative risk of mesothelioma in individuals with
a sibling or parental history of cancer compared with individuals without a sibling or parental history of
cancer. Similar calculations were performed separately for spouses. The expected number of cases was
calculated for age (5-year groups), sex, interval (5-year groups), geographical region and socioeconomic
status-specific standard incidence rates derived from individuals lacking an affected family member. For
each type of familial analysis, a specific reference population was used. For calculation of sibling and
parental risks, the cohort method was used as described in detail by HEMMINKI et al. [25]. In the cohort
method all siblings in families with two or more affected siblings contributed cases and they were
compared with single-case families using the described person-year calculation, which is practically
independent of the number of siblings. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated assuming a Poisson
distribution and were adjusted for dependence between the sibling pairs. Data values were accurate to two
decimal places. All analyses were performed using SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
From the Swedish Cancer Register, a total of 3527 individuals were diagnosed with pleural mesothelioma
between 1961 and 2012 with a median age at diagnosis of 69 years. Male patients (2922 cases)
outnumbered female patients (605 cases). For those patients with a parental or sibling history of
mesothelioma, the median age at diagnosis was 58. Among them, 13 familial cases were males and one
was a female. In figure 1 we can see that the incidence of mesothelioma in males increased gradually since
1961, and reached its peak rate in 2000 and decreased thereafter. The trends for females showed a pattern
similar to males, but the changes in rates were more moderate.

MESOTHELIOMA | J. JI ET AL.
 The risk of mesothelioma in individuals with a relative affected with cancer is shown in table 1. Only
those cancer sites with at least five mesothelioma cases are listed. Familial risk of mesothelioma was
significantly increased when both parents and siblings were diagnosed with mesothelioma, with SIRs of
3.88 (95% CI 1.01–10.04) and 12.37 (95% CI 5.89–22.84) separately. In addition, we found that individuals
with a sibling affected with kidney (SIR 2.13) and bladder cancer (SIR 2.09) had an increased risk of
mesothelioma.
As the incidence of mesothelioma reached its peak rate in 2000 due to the ban on asbestos, we further
examined whether the observed familial risk in table 1 could be varied by the time at diagnosis of
mesothelioma (table 2). For mesothelioma diagnosed up to 2000, the sibling SIR was 9.82 and it was 13.90
for mesothelioma diagnosed after that. However, parental risk of mesothelioma was not significant because
of a limited number of cases. The incidence of mesothelioma was somewhat higher for those diagnosed up
to 2000 with an affected sibling with bladder cancer and for those diagnosed in 2001 or after with an
affected sibling with kidney cancer. However, the SIRs stratified by age at diagnosis in table 2 overlap each
other due to the large confidence intervals.
To assess the extent to which environmental factors contributed to the observed familial association in
table 1, we calculated SIRs for individuals whose spouses were diagnosed with mesothelioma (table 3). The
risk of mesothelioma, kidney and bladder cancers was not increased when their spouses were diagnosed
with mesothelioma. An increased risk of breast and skin (squamous cell) cancers was found in the wives
when their husbands were diagnosed with mesothelioma, and the risk of stomach cancer was increased in
the husbands when their wives were diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Discussion
In this population-based nationwide cohort study, we found that the incidence of mesothelioma reached its
peak rate in 2000 in Sweden and decreased thereafter. In addition, we found that the risk of mesothelioma
was significantly increased when their siblings or parents were diagnosed with mesothelioma. Additional
associations were noted for siblings with kidney and bladder cancers. However, no association was observed
between spouses.

 The incidence of pleural mesothelioma has increased greatly since the 1960s in Sweden, especially for men,
mainly because of the use of asbestos. Diagnosis procedures for mesothelioma may have changed over the
period of study, but are likely to have been a minor factor in the increased incidence, because the observed
increase was largely confined to men. In Sweden, the ban of asbestos in the mid-1970s and early 1980s has
received great attention [24, 26, 27]. Our data clearly showed that the incidence of mesothelioma reached its
peak rate around 2000, which was in line with the previous estimation [24, 26, 27]. The potential latency
period of mesothelioma after exposure to asbestos from the current data would appear to be around 20 years.
Although familial aggregation of mesothelioma has been reported previously [13–16], most publications
were based on case reports without quantifying the relative risk of familial mesothelioma. The current study

 found that the incidence of mesothelioma was increased around four times for those with an affected
parents and increased around 12 times for those with an affected siblings. A few potential factors could
explain the higher sibling risk as compared with parental risk. One possible factor leading to the higher
sibling relative risk is that the familial relative risk could be age-dependent. In this study, the maximal age
for the affected siblings could be under 80 years, whereas the parents used to determine offspring risks may
be older. A previous study showed that familial relative risks decline with age [28] and it is thus reasonable
that the observed sibling relative risks were higher than offspring risks. Another possible factor is that
siblings may share more lifestyle factors compared with parental–offspring pairs, especially for shared
environmental factors during childhood [29], which may play an important role in the development of
cancer in later life [30, 31]. In addition, the higher sibling risk may be due to autosomal recessive
inheritance [25], but such knowledge on mesothelioma is limited. Familial aggregation of mesothelioma
may be due to shared environmental factors or genes shared by family members. Our data cannot
distinguish between the contributions of inheritability or shared environmental factors, or their
interactions, to the observed familial aggregation, because we had no information about asbestos exposure,
which is the main strongest risk factor for pleural mesothelioma. Asbestos workers might go home with
asbestos dust because of a lack of proper industrial hygiene, thus their family members could be exposed to
asbestos (para-occupational exposure), leading to increased familial risk of mesothelioma. To explore the
contribution of para-occupational exposure on the observed association, we studied the association between
spouses, based on the assumption that spouses could have even more relatively intimate contact as
compared with their offspring. We found a nonsignificant association of mesothelioma between spouses,
suggesting that shared environmental factors, such as para-occupational exposure to asbestos, might play a
minor role in the current findings. However, we cannot neglect the contribution of shared environmental
factors based on the current study. Further studies are needed to explore the environmental contribution on
the familial aggregation of mesothelioma. Some genetic studies have found that gene polymorphisms in
glutathione S-transferase M1 [32, 33], N-acetyl-transferase 2 [34] and BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1)
[35, 36] were highly associated with mesothelioma, suggesting that the observed associations may be
contributed somewhat by shared genetic factors between family members.
Associations with discordant cancer sites were also tested in the current study. Kidney and bladder cancers
in siblings showed a significant association with mesothelioma. However, it should be noted that these
could represent chance findings resulting from the large number of associations we examined. Biologic
plausibility and consistency with previous findings might be used to exclude chance associations. As no
parent–offspring aggregation was found for kidney and bladder cancers, we should be cautious of these
observations. However, BAP1 polymorphisms have been found to be associated with both mesothelioma
and kidney cancer [37], which may partly explain the observed association.
The advantages of the present study include the identification of cancer patients from a nationwide
population database and the completeness of follow-up of patients. All the data were retrieved from
nationwide databases, guaranteeing reliable estimation of familial risks because the data on family
relationships and cancers were obtained from registered sources with almost complete coverage. In
addition, many confounding factors, including age, gender, socioeconomic status and region of residence,
were adjusted in the analyses. One limitation of this study is that we had no information about asbestos
exposures. However, we have stratified the familial risk by time at diagnosis and the results were largely
consistent, suggesting that asbestos exposures may contribute a small part of the observed familial
aggregation of mesothelioma.
In summary, the incidence of mesothelioma reached its peak rate after the ban of asbestos in Sweden and
began to decrease thereafter. Familial risk of mesothelioma was significantly increased when parents or
siblings were diagnosed with mesothelioma, but there was no association between spouses. Shared genetic
factors may contribute to the observed familial clustering of mesothelioma, but the contribution of shared
environmental factors could not be neglected. In addition, the association with kidney and bladder cancers
calls for further study to explore the potential mechanisms.
