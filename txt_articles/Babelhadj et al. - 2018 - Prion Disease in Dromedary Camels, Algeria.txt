1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 
Purpose 
 
• To support the statutory discriminatory testing of the different TSEs in small 
ruminants as laid down in Annex X to regulation (EC) No 999/20001. 
• to document the properties which can be used to distinguish small ruminant 
TSE isolates requiring further investigation 
• to provide sampling and testing strategies and protocols for discriminatory  
methods which have been approved by the EURL strain typing expert group 
• to identify those isolates which have the characteristics of the BSE agent  
 
Background 
 
A TSE strain is currently defined as an agent that has distinct and reproducible 
biochemical and molecular characteristics and which, when serially passaged 
through congenic or transgenic mouse lines, produces consistent characteristics 
of relative incubation period, spongiform lesion profile, molecular profile and 
immunopathology. 
 
BSE is defined as a disease of cattle. The apparent consistency of the disease 
leads to the suggestion that the BSE epidemic was caused by a single strain of 
agent, although the existence of two additional strain variants (defined as H-BSE 
and L-BSE) has been recognised1, and the current classification requirements for 
bovine isolates are covered in a separate document.  
http://www.tse-lab-net.eu/documents/tse-rl-blot.pdf 
 
 
Based upon primary passage in RIII mice, strain typing suggests that a single 
strain is responsible for the majority of suspect cases of BSE, novel TSEs in 
other species and vCJD tested so far.  However, transgenic (Tg) mice are 
increasing being used to elucidate the biological properties of individual isolates. 
The most widely published and best-characterised models relevant to the 
characterisation of small ruminant isolates include Tg338 mice (which 
overexpress the ovine VRQ gene) and Tg110 mice (which overexpress the 
bovine gene) amongst others.  
 
Biochemical features cannot at present be equated with the definition of a strain, 
but only as characteristics of a strain.  They do, however, serve as a very useful 
initial screen to identify isolates which merit further investigation.  Certain 
biochemical properties of PrP as seen in Western blots (in particular the 
glycoform ratio, the molecular weight of the unglycosylated band, and the

intensity of labelling with antibodies directed at the N terminal of the PrP) 
correlate well with the diseases BSE, novel TSEs and vCJD, and with the agent 
as isolated in mice. 
 
Whilst there may be a large number of TSE strains in small ruminants, current 
focus is on distinguishing the BSE agent from all others, on the basis that only 
the BSE agent is established as zoonotic. 
 
The basis for the zoonotic property of the BSE agent is not understood. It could 
be a result of: 
• an intrinsic property of the agent 
• passage through cattle and an intrinsic property of bovine prions 
• simply a consequence of dose related to consumption of beef products 
compared to sheep products 
 
In the absence of evidence to the contrary it is generally assumed at present that 
zoonotic potential is an intrinsic property of the BSE agent.  How this relates to 
any of the currently known and measurable properties of the agent is unknown.  
Therefore, in attempting to define the BSE agent, all that can be said at present 
is that it shows the following characteristics in all cases tested: 
• 
Low molecular weight of the unglycosylated band of PrPres on 
Western blot (WB) 
• 
Type 4 glycosylation profile (i.e. PrPres glycoprofile with a 
dominating diglycosyl moiety) on WB. 
• 
Poor or absent binding of antibodies directed at N-terminal epitopes 
(ovPrP93-97 ) in WB or ELISA formats under certain conditions 
• 
Biological phenotype characteristics (e.g. IHC and vacuolation 
distribution, WB, relative incubation periods), which are indistinguishable 
from those of known BSE controls, in mouse bioassay. 
 
These characteristics have been found to be 100% consistent for the BSE agent. 
However, on current evidence none of these characteristics, either alone or in 
combination, can be described as exclusive to the BSE agent. 
 
Congruity with all of the above criteria will be interpreted as ‘the agent in 
question cannot be distinguished from the BSE agent’. 
Variation of one or more characteristics will be interpreted as ‘the agent in 
question is not identical to the BSE agent’. 
 
In 2002, the European Commission requested from the EURL comprehensive 
guidelines in support of the SSC Opinion “Strategy to investigate the possible 
presence of BSE in sheep” (adopted on 4-5 April 2002).  To assist with this task, 
the EURL formed a strain typing  ‘Expert group’ (STEG), with members drawn 
from those laboratories which (at that time) had experience with molecular 
methods which potentially offered some discriminatory potential between BSE

and scrapie isolates.  A requirement to subject all positive isolates to initial 
discriminatory testing is now written into the TSE surveillance regulations  
(999/2001 as amended, 36/2005).  
This manual contains the detailed protocols for these biochemical discriminatory 
methods for adoption by EU NRLs to enable discriminatory testing to be 
undertaken in each member state.  These methods have been subjected to a 
blinded ring-trial to confirm their discriminatory potential and have been approved 
by STEG. http://www.tse-lab-net.eu/documents/tse-rl-ringtrial.pdf 
 
Annual proficiency testing of the discriminatory test performance in each lab is 
co-ordinated by the EURL.

2.  TESTING STRATEGY 
 
(as required in the regulation 999/2001 AS AMENDED 36/2005 (this strategy is 
summarised as a flow chart in Appendix1)) 
 
Animal selection 
 
Animals are currently selected for TSE testing through passive or active 
surveillance of the sheep and goat populations.  
 
Sample requirements 
 
The minimum sampling requirement for any animal from either source 
population is the brainstem (at the level of the obex) and part of the 
cerebellum, both of which can be accessed through the foramen magnum using 
a proprietary sampling spoon (See sampling  guidance document http://www.tse-
lab-net.eu/documents/tse-oie-rl-samp.pdf  for full details of sampling 
requirements and methods). 
 
In summary, the quantity of tissue taken for testing should be sufficient to provide 
the following: 
• A hemisection2 of fresh brainstem at the level of the obex, for the initial 
rapid test ) 
• A fixed cross-section, or hemi-section1 of brainstem at the level of the 
obex for confirmatory IHC.  
• A fixed section of cerebellum, or sufficient fresh cerebellum to conduct an 
OIE-SAF Western blot.  
• Sufficient remaining fresh-frozen medullary tissue (adjacent to the obex) 
and fresh-frozen cerebellum to provide fresh material for primary 
molecular testing (discriminatory WB) and possibly a range of secondary 
and tertiary testing (5-10 g whenever possible).  
• Brain tissue from other areas in addition to the brainstem and cerebellum 
are always an advantage, as are lymphoreticular tissues when available. 
Although not essential for statutory purposes, they will be important in 
characterising the scrapie strain present if results differ from the expected 
confirmation at the level of the obex. 
 
 
                                            
2 Historically, a full transverse cross-section of the brainstem at the level of the obex has been 
recommended for histopathological confirmation. With the advent of rapid molecular techniques the need to 
apply multiple tests in a single animal has led to competition between tests for the optimal early diagnostic 
sites at the obex. Hemisection of the brainstem at the level of the obex will result in loss of the ability to 
assess the symmetry of lesions, but the need for such assessment is less if immunohistochemistry is used. 
If this approach is adopted however, it becomes critical to ensure that the target site is not compromised. 
The dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve (the optimal target area for most cases of scrapie) is small, and lies 
close to midline

Initial TSE monitoring testing, as laid down in point 3.2(a) and (b) of 
Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001 
 
Screening testing 
• 
Active surveillance samples are subjected to one of the approved 
rapid tests (see point 4 of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 
999/2001 or the EURL websiteIt is a requirement that this initial monitoring 
must be capable of detecting atypical scrapie.  
• 
Passive surveillance samples from clinical suspects may bypass rapid 
test and proceed directly to confirmatory testing. 
 
Confirmatory testing 
• 
Any animal found positive by any initial test, in either the active or 
passive surveillance programmes, shall be subject to confirmatory testing 
by one or more of the following methods – immunohistochemistry, 
Western blot, demonstration of characteristic fibrils by electron 
microscopy, or histopathological examination – as detailed in point 3.2(a) 
and (b) of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 999/2001.  
• 
Any TSE case which is confirmed, except atypical scrapie cases, 
should be subject to primary molecular testing to determine whether it is 
classical scrapie, or BSE-like3. 
 
 
Primary molecular testing with a discriminatory immuno-blotting method, 
as laid down in point 3.2(c)(i) of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) 
No 999/2001 
• 
Any positive, non-atypical scrapie, TSE isolate confirmed in sheep or 
goats pursuant to initial screening will be subjected to discriminatory WB 
using one of the protocols listed in part 4 of this Handbook. These tests 
have been assessed, and approved, using a ring trial4 coordinated by the 
EURL STEG which confirmed the ability of these tests to discriminate 
between BSE (either ovine or bovine) and classical scrapie (ovine). 
• 
Possible outcomes of the primary molecular testing: 
o 
If the results of the primary molecular testing (discriminatory 
WB) are compatible with the defined characteristics of classical 
scrapie isolates (see below for interpretational criteria within the 
individual method protocols), the case is confirmed as classical 
scrapie positive and no further testing is required. 
o 
If the results of the primary molecular testing 
(discriminatory WB) are inconclusive or different from above, and 
cannot exclude BSE, the case must be referred to the EURL STEG, 
who will advise on and coordinate secondary molecular testing with 
additional molecular testing methods. This will help to ensure that

such unusual isolates are investigated in a consistent and 
comparable way, and with the relevant controls (which are a finite 
resource, and can thus be conserved as much as possible).  
o 
A poor quality WB (e.g. one that is faint, or overloaded) that 
does not enable clear identification of three bands (diglycosylated, 
monoglycosylated and unglycosylated) cannot be interpreted, and 
must be repeated, or referred to the EURL for a second opinion. 
• 
Full details of test interpretation and specific criteria for referral can be 
found within the protocols for each method in the following section of this 
Handbook. Broadly, cases that require reference to the EURL include 
those with one or more of the following characteristics 
o 
Evidence of a low molecular weight for the unglycosylated 
band of PrPres, relative to scrapie, and, if available, BSE controls. 
(This excludes those isolates with the very low 12-14 kD band 
known to be associated with atypical scrapie) 
o 
Detectable reduction in immunoreactivity with the N-terminal 
specific antibody (binding to the epitope ovPrP 93-97)5 when 
compared with the primary antibody (binding to the core region of 
PrP)6. 
o 
Substantial reduction of signal with an N-terminal antibody 
relative to a core antibody following treatment of the sample with 
PK at a high concentration 
 
 
Secondary molecular testing with additional molecular testing methods, as 
laid down in point 3.2(c)(ii) of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No 
999/2001 
 
• 
Any case referred to the EURL STEG will be further investigated, on a 
case by case basis, using some or all of the following methods: 
o 
a repeat WB using a different method/antibodies to a 
different epitopes 
o 
discriminatory ELISA7  
o 
discriminatory IHC8.  
 
 
• 
If the isolate presents characteristics which are clearly identifiable as 
‘scrapie’ or ‘non-BSE’, a report will be sent to the Commission at this 
stage, and no further testing will be undertaken.

Tertiary testing strategy- Mouse bioassay. 
As laid down in point 3.2(c)(iii) of Chapter C of Annex X to Regulation (EC) No

• 
The optimal bioassay system for this purpose is the subject of active 
discussion by STEG, which will direct any incoming samples 
appropriately. 
 
Much historical data on field isolates has been gathered in conventional congenic 
mouse lines, particularly C57Bl6, VM and RIII mice, which have been considered 
the ‘gold standard’ for strain characterisation. However, it is well known that a 
proportion of field isolates do not transmit to these mouse lines. Also in the past 
10 years a profusion of transgenic mouse lines have become available, and data 
is accumulating with regard to the behaviour of BSE and scrapie isolates in these 
models. The STEG will direct the choice of bioassay for each individual isolate 
based on the data generated in the secondary testing phase, and the current 
state of scientific knowledge at the time of referral, but would propose a default 
panel of Tg 338 and Tg110  as a baseline group.

3.  REPORTING AND REFERRAL SYSTEMS 
 
Data Collection and Provision 
All cases reported should be accompanied by a breakdown of all the data 
requested, as prompted by the national competent authorities. 
For cases being referred for secondary testing, the accompanying data should be 
broken down as indicated in the tabulation attached (appendix 2). This tabulation 
serves three purposes.  
• Provision of a standardised data summary for each referred isolate, 
regardless of where the testing is performed.  
• The collection and direct comparison of similar, objective data on each 
individual case from every MS, and the retrospective reinterpretation / 
regrouping of any individual parameter if required. It will assist with the 
classification, definition and preliminary epidemiological assessment of any 
previously unrecognised isolates that may arise in future. 
 
How to refer an isolate 
 
Each case referred to the EURL STEG should be notified in advance (by email, 
with the subject heading ‘STEG referral {animal ID}’) to the TSE reference 
laboratory mailbox (TSE.EUCommunityRefLab@apha.gsi.gov.uk) 
 
including a copy of the referral form (see appendix 3).  It is particularly important 
that this notification includes an indication of the amount and quality of tissue 
available for subsequent testing. 
 
Please supply all available tissue from each case (unless otherwise requested by 
the EURL STEG following notification). 
 
• All movement of material must be covered by the relevant export and 
import permits.  A copy of the current APHA import permissions can be 
obtained 
by 
request 
via

How results will be reported 
 
Individual secondary molecular testing results will be reported to and collated by 
the EURL, who will compile a summary for the EURL STEG, and a decision will 
be reached on whether further testing by mouse bioassay is required. The 
referring NRL will be party to all discussion and interpretation of secondary 
testing results, as will the Commission. Results will be reported to the submitting 
NRL and the originating MS will be responsible for formal reporting to the 
Commission.  
 
The formal reporting of the final results of secondary testing will be the 
responsibility of the competent authority in the referring MS.  
 
[Note: In accordance with Resolution No. XXVIII, adopted by the OIE 
International Committee in May 2004, OIE Reference Laboratories (of which 
APHA is one) are now required by mandate to inform the OIE Central Bureau of 
confirmed positive diagnostic results for diseases that are reportable to the OIE. 
Such information will be sent by the OIE Central Bureau to the OIE Delegate of 
the country concerned before any publication.]

THE APHA PRIONICS BASED-HYBRID WESTERN BLOT METHOD 
 
INTRODUCTION 
The APHA Prionics based-Hybrid test is a protein extraction and Western 
immunoblotting technique based on the detection of abnormal prion 
protein (PrPSc) from the central nervous tissue of cattle and sheep, which 
can be distinguished from normal prion protein (PrPC), both by its 
protease resistance and molecular size.  This abnormal protein is a 
disease specific  marker of Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy 
(TSE). 
It is based on a modification of the commercially available Prionics 
Check Western kit and utilises a double antibody detection system which 
enables discrimination to be made between cases of natural bovine BSE, 
natural ovine scrapie, and experimental BSE and natural scrapie in 
sheep. 
 
 
SAFETY 
Work with prions or potentially prion-containing materials has to be 
performed in strict accordance with National Safety Regulations. 
Laboratories MUST adhere to National Safety Regulations, but the 
following information, published by The Advisory Committee for 
Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) is available for guidance : “Transmissible 
Spongiform Encephalopathies (TSE) agents: safe working and the 
prevention of infection’. Copies can be obtained (ISBN 0113221665),

PROCEDURE / METHOD 
 
Planning 
 
  
A positive bovine classical BSE and positive classical ovine scrapie are 
always included on each run to validate the processing. Molecular mass 
markers are always included to allow for analysis of the banding patterns 
and molecular mass determination. The number of samples to be 
processed will vary on each run depending on the submissions and 
additional controls may be added if the samples are unusual and further 
examination required. The gel plan will be prepared to include all 
samples to be examined and relevant controls required. 
 
Each gel is duplicated so that matching membranes will be produced to 
probe with different antibodies. This enables a comparison for each 
sample between its affinity for two antibodies targeted at different 
epitopes of the prion protein. 
An example of a gel plan is shown in Fig 1.  
 
 
Homogenisation  
(Note: This stage is carried out in an appropriate safety cabinet according 
to National Safety Regulations) 
Place a Falcon tube (if using Omni homogeniser) onto the balance with a 
draft shield and tare.  Cut out the centre portion of spinal cord or medulla 
using scissors and forceps.  Place between 0.45 – 0.75g of tissue into 
the tube and record the weigh to 2 decimal places. 
 
Add Prionics homogenisation buffer (x1) to provide a 10% suspension, 
e.g. 5ml of buffer to 0.5g of tissue. 
Homogenise tissue using Omni GLH220 for 1 minute ±10sec at 22±3°C. 
 
Ensure that all the tissue has been homogenise completely. If necessary, 
repeat this homogenisation stage. (Use a new disposable Omni probe for 
each sample.)  
 
Note: Omni probes can be re-used by soaking overnight in 20% 
hypochlorite solution and then rinsing 3x in tap water and 1x in Deionised

Water. 
 
The homogenate may be frozen at -20°C or below at this stage and 
tested at a later date 
 
 
Clarifying centrifugation  
(Note: This stage is carried out in an appropriate safety cabinet according 
to National Safety Regulations) 
Set a heating block to 50±1°C and another at 105±3°C. Allow them to 
reach a stable temperature before use. Label a 1.5ml Beckman 
centrifuge tube for each sample.  
 
Vortex homogenates to ensure thorough homogenisation (Note: If 
homogenates have been frozen, ensure that they are completely thawed 
before vortexing). Using a plastic Pasteur pipette transfer 1.5ml of 
homogenate from the homogenisation vessel to a 1.5ml Beckman tube. 
 
Centrifuge the samples for 5 mins at 1.127g (5,000rpm) at 10°C in 
Optima TL Ultracentrifuge using a TLA45 Rotor. 
 
Protease Digest 
(Note: This stage is carried out in an appropriate safety cabinet according 
to National Safety Regulations) 
Label a digestion plate for processing the run. Add 10µl of Prionics 
Proteinase K solution to each well using a stepper pipette. 
 
Remove 2 x 100µl of supernatant using a micropipette (40-200µl) and 
place in the duplicate pre-assigned wells on the digestion plate according 
to the plate plan and mix by gentle pipetting.  
 
Place the digestion plate on the heating block set at 50±1°C.  Incubate 
for 45±1 minutes. 
 
Add 10µl of Prionics digestion stop to each well of the digestion plate 
using the stepper pipette and 100µl of Prionics sample buffer using a 
micropipette (40-200µl).  Mix by gentle pipetting. 
 
NOTE: The procedure at this point may be stopped and carried out the 
following day if the digestion plate is sealed (with a sealing film) and 
stored at -20°C or below. 
 
Electrophoresis – Preparatory steps 
Set up the electrophoresis tanks. Remove white tape from lower edge of 
gel. Remove plastic combs from gel and using a Pasteur pipette, gently 
flush wells with running buffer.  
 
Place 2 gels in each tank, the shorter sides facing inward. Raise gels up 
and clamp in place. If a single gel is to be run then a blank plate is 
inserted in the tank. Place approx. 2 cm running buffer in the outer

chamber of each tank to prevent the gel base drying out whilst loading. 
 
Sample Denaturation and Electrophoresis 
Boil the samples in the digestion plate (105 ±3°C) on the heating block 
for 10 ±1 minutes. (Note: Stored digested samples previously boiled and 
tested should only be heated for 2-5 minutes at 65±3°C).  
 
Boil the molecular weight standard solution (105 ±3°C) for 5±1 minutes. 
 
Set the other heating block to 65±3°C. Place sufficient Prionics control, 
(10µl for each gel) into a 0.5ml Eppendorf. Heat for 2-5 mins. 
 
Load 10µl of each sample into lanes according to the gel plan. The 
outside lanes of each edge are not used. 10µl of Prionics control is 
loaded into the far left-hand lane of each gel. 5µl of biotinylated 
molecular weight standard is loaded into the inner left lane and also the 
far right. Known bovine and ovine controls are loaded on the right hand 
side.  
 
Repeat the loading on another gel, to give a duplicate gel which is 
identically loaded and can be probed with a different antibody. 
 
Release the clamp, gently lower the gels and reclamp into position. 
Slowly fill the inner buffer chamber with Running Buffer (x1).  Fill the 
outer chamber with Running Buffer (x1) so that the level is approximately 
3cm above the bottom of the gels.  Add 500µl of Antioxidant to the inner 
chamber using a micropipette (200-1000µl).  Place the lid onto the tank. 
   
Run the gels at 200V until dye front is about 1-2cm from the bottom of 
the gel (approximately 45mins). 
 
Protein Transfer – Preparatory steps 
Fill the transfer tank halfway with transfer buffer (x1) and place the 
cooling coil next to the red side.  Switch on the cooler tank. Ensure it is 
set at 4 ±3oC.  Add a magnet to the transfer tank and place the tank in a 
tray on a magnetic stirrer. 
 
Cut the PVDF membrane to fit all the gels to be transferred (maximum 6 
gels and 1 membrane per antibody). Handle the membrane with care, 
using forceps at the corner.  
 
Pre-treat the PVDF membranes, by soaking them in methanol for a few 
seconds. Rinse in distilled/deionised water for 2 minutes. Equilibrate the 
membranes in transfer buffer (x1) for at least 10 minutes.   
 
Cut 2 sheets of blotting paper to the size of each membrane. 
After the gel electrophoresis has finished, remove the gels from the tanks 
and open the gel plates with a cleaver. 
 
Trim the gels with the cleaver to remove the top 1/3 and the bottom just

below the dye-front.  
Place the gels in transfer buffer (x1) and gently agitate for a few seconds 
before placing in sandwich. 
 
Protein Transfer – Sandwich Assembly and Protein Transfer 
In the safety cabinet, open the transfer cassette and place in a tray 
containing transfer buffer (x1) with the clear side at the bottom of the 
tray. 
(Ensure all following steps are immersed in transfer buffer). 
 
On the clear side of the cassette place a sponge and a piece of wetted 
blotting paper, on top of this the membrane should be positioned.  Write 
the reference number and antibody on the top right hand corner of the 
membrane with a china marker.  The gels are placed on top of the 
membrane, ensuring they are in the correct orientation. The second 
piece of blotting paper is placed on top of the gels.  The final sponge is 
placed on top of the blotting paper and the cassette is closed.  
 
Note: After each layer is added to the sandwich, roll out air bubbles with 
a roller.  
  
Place the cassettes in the transfer tank the clear side facing the red side 
of the tank and the black side facing the black side of the tank.  Top up 
the tank with transfer buffer (x1) and position the lid on top (red to red, 
black to black). 
 
Run the power supply at 150V for 60±2 minutes. 
 
When the protein transfer is completed, disassemble the sandwich and 
place the membranes in incubation boxes containing 50ml Prionics 
PVDF blocking buffer (25ml for a 1 gel membrane, 50ml for a 6 gel 
membrane) for 30 ±5 minutes at 22 ±3°C. 
 
Immunological detection 
Dilute the primary antibodies in TBST, mAb6H4 (1:5000) and mAb P4 
(1:5000).  Prepare a volume sufficient to cover the membrane in the 
incubation boxes, one incubation box for each antibody. (25ml for a 1 gel 
membrane, 50ml for a 6 gel membrane). 
 
Pour the blocking buffer into a discard container and add the primary 
antibody solutions to the appropriate membrane in the incubation box. 
Incubate on a rocking platform for 60 ±5 minutes (mAb 6H4) and 120 ±5 
minutes (mAb P4) at 22 ±3°C, or 12-18h at 5±3°C. 
 
Wash the membrane 3 times for approximately 7 minutes with TBST. 
 
Dilute the appropriate secondary antibody solution (1:5000) and 
Streptavidin (1:2000 of stock solution). (25ml for a 1 gel membrane, 50ml 
for a 6 gel membrane). Add the secondary antibody solution and 
incubate on a rocking platform for a minimum 30 ±3 minutes at 22 ±3°C

Wash the membrane 3 times for approximately 7 minutes with TBST. 
 
Signal detection using x-ray film 
Equilibrate the membrane in Prionics luminescence buffer for a minimum 
of  5 minutes (25ml for a 1 gel membrane, 50ml for a 6 gel membrane). 
 
Under appropriate safelight conditions in the dark room, blot off the 
excess luminescence buffer very gently, and transfer membrane to a 
clean glass/polythene surface. 
 
Add up to 5ml of CDP-Star substrate to the surface of the membrane and 
distribute evenly, incubate for 5 ±1 minutes at 22 ±3°C.  Blot off the 
excess substrate, and place the membrane in the development folder. 
 
Place the development folder in the x-ray cassette.  Place a sheet of x-
ray film on top of the membrane and close the cassette.   
 
Expose the membrane to the X-ray film. The actual exposure time will 
vary according to the samples processed and the suggested range is 
between 30 seconds and 20 minutes. The film should be exposed until a 
strong signal of the positive control and either the background or the 
proteinase K bands are visible. Expose for longer or shorter times for 
optimal signal visualisation. 
 
Place the film in a tray of x-ray developer solution for 5 minutes with 
occasionally agitation. 
 
Wash the film for 1 minute in a tray of tap water. 
 
Place the film in x-ray fixer for 5 minutes.  The light can be turned on 
once the film is fully submerged.  Leave the film in the fixer for 5 minutes. 
 
Thoroughly wash the film in running tap water for 1 minute and then 
hang the film up to dry. 
 
Signal detection using a CCD imager 
Equilibrate the membrane in Prionics luminescence buffer for 5-10 
minutes (25ml for a 1 gel membrane, 50ml for a 6 gel membrane). 
 
Blot off the excess luminescence buffer very gently and transfer 
membrane to a clean glass/polythene surface. 
 
Add up to 5ml of CDP-Star substrate to the surface of the membrane and 
distribute evenly, incubate for 5 ±1 minutes at 22 ±3°C. Blot off the 
excess substrate and transfer to a clean polythene surface. 
 
Place the membrane into the imager and detect the light signal using 1 & 
10 minute exposures. Label the blot with sample and control details from 
gel loading plan and also include run number, method of processing,

INTERPRETATION OF THE APHA PRIONICS BASED-HYBRID WESTERN 
IMMUNOBLOT RESULTS 
 
This method is capable of identifying PrPSc profiles associated with classical 
bovine BSE, atypical H and L-type bovine BSE, classical ovine scrapie and 
experimental BSE in sheep. 
The method is not suitable for detection of atypical scrapie 
 
Using this method, clear but subtle differences in the molecular mass migration are 
observed (see Figure 2) between natural bovine BSE (lanes 7 & 13), natural ovine 
scrapie (lanes 2, 3, 10, 11 & 12), and experimental BSE in sheep (lanes 5, 6, 8 & 9) 
when detected with mAb 6H4. 
Sheep passaged scrapie strain CH1641 (lane 4) mimics the same molecular weight 
and antibody affinity pattern as for experimental BSE in sheep. 
 
A negative sample will have been totally digested by proteinase K and no signal will 
be visualised with either antibody, illustrated in figure 1b (lane 4). 
 
With mAb P4, used at the dilution in this method, natural ovine scrapie is strongly 
detected (lanes 2, 3, 10, 11 & 12), there is a clear reduction in signal for experimental 
BSE in sheep and CH1641 (lanes 5, 6, 8, 9 & 4)  and natural bovine BSE is not 
detected at all (lanes 7 & 13). 
 
A negative sample will have been totally digested by proteinase K and so no signal 
will be visualised (lane 14). 
 
Any samples that give a banding profile that is not consistent with classical 
scrapie should be referred to the EURL for a second opinion and further 
investigation where necessary. 
 
LIMITATIONS OF THE TEST 
 
 The method requires sufficient tissue from the optimal brain area, in order to 
maximize the amount of PrPSc loaded from each sample. 
o If the quantities of brain material are too low (a situation we have 
encountered with active surveillance), the number of Western blots that 
could be run from a single sample may not be sufficient to obtain an 
accurate interpretation and there may not be enough PrPSc in 
underweight samples to confirm a diagnosis even though the sample 
may be positive. 
  
 It is important to compare the molecular weights of samples, relative to each 
other and the controls on the same gel.  
 
 Care must be taken in interpretation, as samples that have not been digested 
correctly may initially appear positive. These should be repeated. 
  
 APHA Prionics-based Hybrid Method

Version 8.1 January 2018 
TSE EURL Reviewed: 22/01/2018 
 
 
 
 Strong positive samples may give a saturated signal intensity which will 
obscure visual interpretation of the banding profile. This type of sample 
requires repeat immunoblotting following dilution, so a clear banding pattern is 
observed. 
 
 The full banding profile may not be visualised in weaker samples. 
 
We have shown that differences in the ovine genotype do not appear to give any 
variation in the banding obtained for scrapie samples but autolysed samples can run 
quicker through the gel and may resulting in a lower molecular weight than the 
equivalent fresh sample. At present we do not know whether mAb P4 results are 
affected by autolysis.  
 
We have only assessed certain genotypes of experimental sheep-BSE and some 
molecular weight variability of natural sheep-BSE, if it is in the ovine population, 
cannot be ruled out at this stage. 
 
RESULT SUMMARY: 
 
Classical Bovine BSE:  
 
Signal and low molecular mass migration (compared to ovine) with mAb 6H4. 
 
No signal with mAb P4.

ANSES DISCRIMINATORY WESTERN BLOT 
 
Principle  
 
A Western blotting technique using two different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
BAR233 and P4 to identify BSE among scrapie cases in small ruminants, based on 
the differences in molecular masses and in reactivities with these two mAbs.  
In this test, molecular differences between scrapie and BSE are the result of different 
resistances to proteinase K (pK) digestion. The abnormal prion protein is indeed 
more susceptible to pK cleavage than most scrapie cases. More precisely a larger 
part of the protein is digested by pK in BSE. This results in a lower molecular mass 
of the unglycosylated form of the pK digested PrP protein (PrP res). This molecular 
mass is slightly lower in BSE-in-sheep compared to cattle BSE, in contrast with most 
scrapie cases. Using mAb P4 recognising an epitope close to protease cleavage 
site, BSE also appears faintly, if at all, labelled, in contrast with most scrapie cases. 
Suspect molecular samples should be referred to the EURL for further analysis.

Materials required  
* Tissue homogeniser such as RIBOLYSER (HYBAID) or TeSeE Precess® Biorad.  
* Syringes of 1ml and 25G needles (BioRad).  
* Heating block (used at 37°C and 100°C).  
* Centrifuge for Eppendorf tubes.  
* Electrophoretic and Blotting cells and apparatus(with cooling system).  
* Versadoc 5000  
* Micropipettes delivering volumes of 10, 50, 200 and 1000 μl.  
 
Method  
The starting amount of brainstem material (preferentially obex region) to be analysed 
may depend on the origin / quality of the sample and the amount of available 
material but in general 350 mg of tissue is used.  
 
Purification and denaturation  
As described in the BioRad TeSeE WB SOP (BIORAD #355 1169)  
 
SDS-PAGE & Western Blot  
1. Incubate each tube for 5 minutes at 100°C in a heating block just before loading 
samples on the acrylamide gel.  
 
2. Run two identical gels with the same samples and respect gel plan described in 
annexe 1, that allows a comparison of each sample to be examined with a cattle 
BSE control loaded on the lane beside.  
 
3. Electrophoresis is carried out at 200V for 1h20 with electrophoresis buffer 
(solution 5).  
4. The two gels are transfered on to Hybond LFP 0.2µm PVDF membrane 
(Amersham # RPN303LFP) (previously re-hydrated with alcohol) at 115 V for 1h with 
Blotting buffer (solution 6).  
 
5. The membranes are blocked in 10 ml of Blocking buffer (solution 9 or 10) for 1 
hour.  
 
6. Membranes are incubated 30 minutes at room temperature in 10 ml of a 1:10000 
dilution of primary monoclonal antibody Bar 233 or 1:5000 dilution for primary 
monoclonal antibody P4 (1 mg/ml) in PBS-T buffer (solution 8) (NB MAb dilutions 
are not definitively defined. Working dilutions have to be evaluated for each batch.)  
 
7. Membranes are washed in PBS-T buffer (solution 8) 20 minutes  
 
8. Incubate the membranes in the secondary antibody (1:2500) (goat anti-mouse 
conjugated to streptavidine peroxidase) (Cliniscience # 101005) with Streptavidin-
peroxidase (0,1μl/ml) for 20 minutes at room temperature.

9. They are then washed again in PBS-T (solution 8) 30 minutes, and a final wash 
with PBS (solution 7) during 5 minutes.  
 
10. Then, membranes are incubated in chemiluminescence buffer E.C.L. 
(Amersham # RPN 2109) in order to take a picture on autoradiographics films 
(Amersham # RPN 1674K).  
 
11. The labelling is visualised by means of the enhanced chemiluminescence 
system. Signals are quantified using Versadoc 5000 computer analysis (Quantity 
One, software Biorad UK Ltd) or equivalent, allowing the detection of 
chemiluminescent signals and quantitative analysis of the data.  
 
12. If the band signal obtained with use of chemiluminescent buffer ECL is weak, 
after a wash (5 min) in PBS (solution 7), SuperSignal Dura chemiluminescence 
buffer (Interchim # 34075) could be used.  
 
Data analysis  
 
13. Using this system, apparent molecular weights of the unglycosylated band are 
measured by comparison to the biotinylated markers on the gel and the centre 
position for each sample band is determined to measure the apparent molecular 
weight. To obtain a comparison of molecular weights between the samples, results 
are expressed in differential molecular weights (dmw), corresponding to the 
differences between the apparent molecular weight of the sample and that of the 
cattle BSE control which is loaded on the lane beside (see annexe 2 of this section).  
 
14. Before sample analysis some verifications must be made. The quality of the 
electrophoretic mobility is checked with the use of two controls: Ovine scrapie control 
and cattle BSE control. The dmw of the ovine scrapie control loaded must be 
positive. If this is not the case the blot must be repeated. The homogeneity of the 
unglycosylated band molecular weight of the four cattle BSE control must be 
evaluated. All of them have to be similar, if one of them differs by more than 0.5 kDa, 
samples situated near cannot be interpreted. Mabs labelling is controlled with the 
visual analysis of the differential immune-reactivity for ovine scrapie control: for 
validation of analysis P4 labelling must be more intensive or equivalent of Bar233 
labelling.  
 
15. Check that the positive or negative dmw obtained following computer analysis 
are consistent with the apparent dmw on the film and that the technical quality of the 
blot allows a correct interpretation of the data.  
 
16. Differential immuno-reactivity between WB Bar 233 and WB P4 for is observed 
for each sample, immuno-reactivities being assessed with both antibodies as ++, +, 
+/- or -, as illustrated in annexe 2 (of this method section).

Interpretation 
See annexe 2 (of this method section)  as an example  
 
Differential Molecular Weights (dmw): 
 
 
 A sample with a Dmw > 0,200 is not suspect, and does not lead to 
further action. 
 
 
 A sample with a Dmw < 0,200 should be retested: 
 
 
 
 if the second analysis gives a result as: Dmw < 0 then the 
sample is suspect and should be referred to the EURL for further analysis. 
 
 
 
 if the second analysis gives a result as: Dmw > 0 then 
sample is not suspect and does not lead to further action. 
 
Differential Immuno-Reactivity: 
The immuno-reactivities are assessed with scores as ++, +, +/- or -. (see annexe 
2) 
 
 A sample with differential immuno-reactivity showing: P4 signal ≥ Bar 
233 signal is not suspect, and does not lead to further action. 
 
 A sample with differential immuno-reactivity showing: P4 signal << Bar 
233 signal is suspect and should be referred to the EURL for further analysis. 
 
Note about the  influence of the PrP res quantity in the sample: 
 Negative or very weakly positive samples with 2 µl per lane should be retested 
with higher volumes of PrPres extracts.  In this case, the same volumes of cattle 
BSE control should be loaded, but keeping the same quantity of PrPres loaded in 
these lanes; add Loading buffer to obtain the desired volume. 
For repeatedly negative samples or very weak positive samples with BAR233, 
the interpretation of the apparent molecular weight of the unglycosylated band 
can be impossible.  Nevertheless, if the signal with the mAb P4 is stronger than 
the signal with mAb BAR233, suspicion of BSE can be excluded. 
  
For very strongly positive samples with mAb BAR233, the signal with mAbs P4 
can be apparently strongly positive with a BSE sample and the interpretation of 
the molecular mass is sometimes difficult (large diffusion of the bands).  In this 
situation, strongly positive samples should be retested following dilution and then 
re-run, beside the same volumes of cattle BSE control.  The same quantities of 
PrPres extracts in the cattle BSE controls (as compared to the normally 2µl 
loaded, should be used; add Loading buffer to obtain the desired volume.

The FLI-method 
 
Introduction 
The FLI-test includes the determination of molecular masses, antibody binding 
affinities and glycosylation pattern of the TSE induced abnormal prion protein. 
The method is based on a Western blotting technique which uses two 
monoclonal antibodies (L42, P4) to discriminate scrapie in small ruminants from 
BSE in small ruminants. (Gretzschel et al 2005). 
The technique involves protein extraction from central nervous system followed 
by homogenization and digestion with proteinase K. Normal cellular prion protein 
(PrPC) will be completely hydrolysed whereas the abnormal pathological form 
PrPSc harbours a partial resistance to proteinase K digestion and will therefore 
only be reduced by 80-100 amino acids from the amino terminus, while the core 
region and the carboxyterminus remain intact. 
 
According to the FLI-Test, PrPSc in a sample will be judged BSE-like, if the 
sample conforms to all three biochemical attributes: 
 the glycoform ratio shows a clear predominance of the diglycosylated form 
 the signal obtained using mab L42 is clearly stronger that the signal 
obtained with mab P4 
 the molecular mass of the unglycosylated PrP is lower than that of the 
scrapie control 
In case these three points cannot be answered by visual interpretation, the blots 
needs to be analysed using the Quantity One software. If that does not lead to a 
clear result, the test needs to be repeated.

3. Procedure/Method 
All steps with infectious material are carried out in an appropriate safety cabinet. 
 
3.1. Purification and proteinase K digestion 
 Prepare 10% (% weight in volume [w/v] ) homogenate from brainstem 
samples,  in homogenization buffer by using a Ribolyser (Hybaid, 
Heidelberg, Germany) set for 2 x 45 seconds; velocity unit 6.5.  
 Remove gross cellular debris by centrifugation at 6.000 g for 1 min at 
room temperature.  
 Add 2.5µl Benzonase (10.000 U/ml) and 5 µl MgCl2 (100 mM) to 500 µl 
homogenate and incubate samples for 30 min at 37°C with constant 
agitation (550 rpm).  
 Add 25 µl PK solution (1 mg/ml) and incubate at 55°C for 1 h.  
 Stop digestion by addition of 10 μl Pefabloc (0.1 M) and heating for 5 min 
at 95°C.  
 Mix samples with 500 μl PBS containing 4% (w/v) sarkosyl and incubate 
for 30 min at 37°C with constant agitation (550 rpm). 
 samples are adjusted with 78.2 μl of a stock solution containing 4% (w/v) 
sodium phosphotungstic acid and 34 mmol/l magnesium chloride to give a 
final concentration in the sample of 0.3 % (w/v) sodium phosphotungstic 
acid. 
  Incubate samples at 37°C for 60 min with constant agitation (550 rpm) 
before centrifugation at 14.000g for 30 min at room temperature 
 
 
3.2. SDS-PAGE and Western blot 
 
 After careful isolation of the supernatant, resuspend pellets in 40 µl 
sample buffer, heat for 5 min at 95°C and centrifuge shortly.  
 Load samples on 16% Tris-polyacrylamide gels. Each sample is loaded on 
at least two gels. The sample volume to be loaded on the gel depends on 
the signal of the diagnostic sample in comparison with the positive 
controls (see section 3.3). A sheep scrapie, a bovine BSE and a negative 
control must be included in each assay. 
 Electrophoresis is carried out at 100V (stacking gel) followed by 200V 
(separating gel) until the dye front reaches the bottom of the gel 
(approximately 90 mins). 
 Transfer proteins onto polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore, 
Billerica, USA) using a semi-dry blotter set at 15 V and 0.3 A/Gel for 45 
minutes. 
 Incubate membranes for 1 h in 5 % (w/v) non-fat milk powder in PBS 
containing 0.1 % (v/v) Tween-20 (PBST) to block unspecific binding 
 One gel is incubated with the monoclonal antibody L42 (binds to amino 
acids 145 to 163 of the ovine PrP) at a concentration of 0.4 µg/ml in 5% 
(w/v) non-fat dry milk powder in PBST 
 The second gel is incubated with the monoclonal antibody P4 (binds to 
amino acid 89-104 of the ovine PrP) at a concentration of 0.4 µg/ml in 5% 
(w/v) non-fat dry milk powder in PBST

 Incubate membranes for 1.5 h at room temperature 
 Wash three times for ten minutes in PBST 
 Incubate in alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin  
(0.15 µg/ml) for 1 h at room temperature   
 Wash three times for ten minutes in PBST 
 Equilibrate membranes two times for two minutes in Assay buffer 
 Add 1.5 ml CDP Star substrate on the membrane and incubate for five 
minutes 
 Visualize signal using either a digital imaging system (e.g. VersaDoc) or 
an X-ray developing system 
 
3.3. Data analysis 
 
The blots are analysed visually, evaluating the three points mentioned in the 
introduction: 
According to the FLI-Test, PrPSc in a sample will be judged BSE-like, if the 
sample conforms to all three biochemical attributes: 
 the glycoform ratio shows a clear predominance of the diglycosylated form 
 the signal obtained using mab L42 is clearly stronger that the signal 
obtained with mab P4 
 the molecular mass of the unglycosylated PrP is lower than that of the 
scrapie control 
In case these three points cannot be answered by visual interpretation, the blots 
needs to be analysed using the Quantity One software. If that does not lead to a 
clear result, the test needs to be repeated. 
 
Testing must also be repeated if the results of the positive or negative controls 
are untypical or if the result of the diagnostic sample cannot be interpreted 
following the above described method. This might be: 
- very faint signals (repeat FLI-test with a higher amount of brain homogenate) 
- very strong signals (dilute resuspended sample in an appropriate volume)

THE CIDC-LELYSTAD DISCRIMINATORY METHOD 
 
 
1. Introduction 
This procedure describes a method to discriminate between BSE and 
scrapie-like status in brain isolates of confirmed TSE-positive sheep and 
goats.  The intention is to find BSE-like infections in small ruminants.  The 
method described is based on the findings of Thuring et al. (2004).  It 
consists of two Western blots run in parallel with the same set of samples, 
using mostly materials and procedures of the Prionics Check Western test 
for BSE testing.  Essential difference is the use of the two blots and the 
their development with different PrP-specific monoclonal antibodies, P4 
and 94B4.  The use of two blots obviates the need of molecular weight 
estimation of the PrPres protein bands, and thus is not subject to variations 
in such measurements.  Visual inspection will already in most cases yield 
a diagnosis, but with difficult cases a density scan of photographic film can 
be recorded and from this a BSE-like diagnosis can be based on the 
density ratio 94B4/P4 using appropriate software.  Nevertheless, other 
characteristics can still be estimated like molecular weight - provided 
molecular weight markers are run alongside - and glycoprofile.  However, 
these measurements are not the purpose of the method. 
 
TSE-positive isolates are usually initially detected by routine testing for 
TSE in small ruminants and confirmed positive by histopathology and 
immunohistochemistry.  The sample must be retested from homogenate 
together with known bovine BSE, ovine scrapie and, if available but not 
necessary, experimental BSE sheep isolate as reference samples to 
confirm the validity of the test. 
 
The behaviour of atypical scrapie material in this method is discussed in 
the interpretation of the results (paragraph 5.5.6).

− Place in the dark an X-ray film on top of the plate and close the 
cassette. 
 
− Expose the film for 0.5, 1, 5, and 15 minutes in the dark. 
 
− Develop the X-ray film in the film developing machine.  The film should 
have the lanes not overexposed which means that PrPres bands per 
lane should be visible as separate bands.  Sometimes films with 
different exposure times are required to have all samples on an 
acceptable density. 
 
5.5.6  Visual Interpretation 
 
− BSE and scrapie appear with a characteristic PrPres 3 banding pattern, 
the lowest visible band producing the weakest signal (upper band = 
diglycosylated, middle = monoglycosylated and lower = unglycosylated 
PrPres).  In a weak sample only the stronger upper 1 or 2 bands are 
visible). 
 
− Discriminating BSE-like isolates from scrapie-like isolates in TSE 
infected sheep: For BSE-like isolates a relative difference is noted in 
staining intensity with P4 (weak or negative) clearly weaker than 94B4. 
MAb 94B4 (and Mab’s 6H4 and 9A2) detects all BSE- and scrapie-
isolates well. MAb P4 detects only scrapie isolates well.  From this 
follows, that Scrapie-like isolates hardly exhibit a difference in staining 
intensity between both antibodies per sample.  If there are doubts 
about the interpretation, a density scan can be made.  Again: the 
diagnosis is only valid if the blots were run together, and if they were 
exposing the same film.  See paragraph below: digitalisation and 
interpretation of results. 
 
− Molecular weights of PrPres bands: MAb 94B4 (and MAb 6H4 and 9A2) 
detects also slight modifications in molecular weight of PrPres bands 
between scrapie and BSE isolates related to the respective control 
scrapie samples on the same gel. 
 
− The Prionics control sample (see Fig. 1, lanes 1) reacts strongly with 
MAb 94B4 (and MAb’s 6H4 and 9A2) and -relative to this -  MAb P4 
yields only  weak staining.  This is due to the relatively low affinity of P4 
for bovine PrP. P4 has a much better affinity for ovine PrP than for 
bovine PrP. 
 
− The recently detected Nor98-like cases and potentially other atypical 
forms of TSEs in sheep and goat (Benestad et al., 2003; Orge et al., 
2004; Buschmann et al., 2004; Gavier-Widen et al., 2004; De 
Bosschere et al.; 2004; Onnasch et al., 2004; LeDur et al., 2005; 
Everest et al., 2006) differ from BSE and classical scrapie in sheep, 
because of a very different PrPres banding pattern and a reduced 
resistance to PK treatment.  Atypical cases will, therefore, not show up 
in this procedure and, if they do, these will have a prominent reactivity

with antibody P4 which is stronger than with core specific antibodies 
6H4 or 94B4. 
 
 
Digitalisation and interpretation of dubious results from visual inspection: 
 
Usually, the diagnosis negative (NEG) and BSE-like (BSE) can be concluded by 
visual inspection of the film.  Lanes which contain bovine or ovine BSE samples 
will show a weak to negative staining with P4, while 94B4 (or 6H4 or 9A2) will 
exhibit a clearly stronger than P4 staining.  
 
However, when the difference between the P4 and 94B4 blot is less clear for a 
certain sample, the data can be subjected to a more quantifiable approach.  In 
that case the film exposed to the two blots with monoclonals 94B4 (or 6H4, 9A2) 
and P4 have to be scanned using a scanner for density recording.  For those 
samples which have been designated TSE-positive i.e. reactive with 94B4 (or 
6H4, or 9A2), densities of protein bands can be recorded from the film with e.g. 
an Agfa Duoscan T200XL scanner, further processed with GelPro software 
(MediaCybernetics, Silver Spring, Md.), or other software dedicated to process 
electronic data from blots.  By using similar measuring windows for each set of 
lanes (94B4 and P4) the densities of the two blots per sample can be derived by 
the Gelpro software.  The GelPro software can express the data as integrated 
optical densities (IOD).  These IOD values are further used for density ratio 
calculations by hand, or by digital processing in a spread sheet program like 
Microsoft Excel.  The ratio to be calculated is: 94B4/P4 (or 6H4/P4, or 9A2/P4).  
Any ratio value >1.5 is indicative for a BSE-like diagnosis (see Thuring et al., 
2004; see example of ring trial samples in Figures 1 and 2).

THE ISS DISCRIMINATORY WESTERN BLOT 
 
Introduction  
 
The ISS discriminatory Western Blot is an immunoblotting technique based 
on the detection of abnormal prion protein (PrPSc) from the central nervous 
tissue of sheep and goat.  The test allows the determination of the 
molecular weight and uses a double antibody detection method which 
enables discrimination to be made between cases of scrapie and 
experimental BSE.  
 
Safety 
 
Work with prions or potentially prion-containing materials has to be 
performed in strict accordance with National Safety Regulations. 
Laboratories MUST adhere to National Safety Regulations, but the following

Procedure 
 
Planning 
 
A known ovine positive sample (scrapie control) is always included in each 
run.   
Molecular weight markers are always included to allow the analysis of 
banding patterns and molecular weight determination. 
 
Each gel is duplicated so that matching membranes will be produced to 
probe with different antibodies.  This enables a comparison of each sample 
for its affinity for the two antibodies targeted at different epitopes of the 
prion protein. 
 
Homogenisation 
 
Work in an appropriate safety cabinet 
 
Take 250-350mg of brainstem material, put into a 5 ml polystyrene tube and 
record the weight.  
 
Add homogenisation buffer to provide 20% w/v suspension (e.g. 1.5ml of 
buffer to 300mg of tissue). 
 
Place a clean homogenisation probe into the Omni homogeniser and 
homogenise for 1 min, with the homogeniser speed set at “3”. 
 
The homogenate may be kept frozen at -30°C and tested at a later date. 
The homogenate is stable for 3 weeks at -30°C.

Set a thermomixer to 25°C. 
 
Label a Eppendorf tube for each sample and distribute 150μl of digestion 
buffer in each tube with a micropipette (40-200μl). 
 
Transfer 150μl of homogenate from the homogenisation tube to a 1.5ml 
Eppendorf tube with a micropipette (40-200μl) and mix thoroughly. 
 
Place the Eppendorf tubes in the thermomixer (1000 rpm) and incubate for 
20 mins. 
 
Set a thermomixer to 38°C. 
 
Place the Eppendorf tubes in a centrifuge, ensuring rotor is balanced.  
Centrifuge for 10 mins at 1,000g  at room temperature. 
 
Label a Eppendorf tube for each sample and add 50μl of proteinase K 
solution to each tube using a micropipette (10-100μl). 
 
Remove 250μl of supernatant using a micropipette (200-1000μl), place in 
the labelled Eppendorf tube and mix thoroughly by pipetting. 
 
Place the tubes in the thermomixer set at 38°C and at 1000 rpm.  Incubate 
for 60 mins. 
 
Remove the tubes from the thermomixer and add 10μl of digestion stop 
solution to each tube using a micropipette (10-100μl). 
 
Label a new Eppendorf tube for each sample and put 30μl of loading buffer

Add 50μl of digested homogenate into each Eppendorf tube using a 
micropipette (10-100μl) and mix thoroughly. 
 
Keep the remaining digested homogenate frozen at -30°C for later use (see 
Sample concentration).  The digested homogenate is stable for 1 week at -
30°C. 
 
Sample concentration (to be used only for samples negative after the first 
analysis – see Data analysis) 
 
Weakly positive or negative samples should be retested after PrPSc 
concentration.  In these cases the scrapie control should also be 
concentrated.

Protein transfer 
 
While the gels are running, cut the PVDF membrane with scissors to fit all 
the gels to be transferred.  One membrane per antibody.  Handle the 
membrane with care, using forceps at the corner. 
 
Pre-treat the PVDF membranes, by soaking them in methanol for 15 
seconds. Transfer to distilled/deionised water for 2 minutes.  Equilibrate the 
membranes in transfer buffer for at least 15 minutes.  Cut two sheets of 
Whatman paper to the size of each membrane.  Wet the sponges and the 
sheets of Whatman paper in transfer buffer. 
 
When electrophoresis has finished, remove the gels from the tanks and 
open the gel plates with a cleaver.  
 
Trim the gels with the cleaver to remove the top 1/3 and the bottom just 
below the dye-front.  Cut a corner of the gel corresponding to the upper part 
of the control lane.  Place the gels in transfer buffer and gently agitate for a 
few seconds before placing in sandwich. 
 
Open the transfer unit and place in a tray containing transfer buffer with the 
deeper part of the transfer cassette facing upwards.  (Ensure all following 
steps are immersed in transfer buffer).  After each layer is added to the 
sandwich roll out air bubbles with a roller.  On the bottom of the sandwich 
place two sponges, a piece of wetted Whatman paper and the gel.  Label 
the PVDF membrane and put it on the gel.  The second piece of Whatman 
paper is placed on top of the membrane.  The final two sponges are placed 
on top of the blotting paper and the cassette is closed.  
 
Place the cassettes in the electrophoresis tank.  Top up the inner chamber 
with cold transfer buffer and the outer chamber with cold distilled water.  
Position the lid on top and connect to the power supply (red to red, black to 
black).  Run the power supply at 30V constant for 60 minutes.  
 
When the run has finished, disassemble the sandwich and cut a corner of 
the membrane corresponding to the corner of the gel previously identified, 
before placing the membranes in incubation boxes in PBST buffer for 10 
minutes at room temperature on a rocking platform. 
 
 
Immunological detection 
 
Place the membrane in 25ml of blocking buffer on a rocking platform for 50 
mins at room temperature. 
 
After a wash with 50ml of PBST, the membranes are incubated for 50 mins 
on a rocking platform at room temperature in 15ml of a 1:250 dilution of 
primary antibody SAF84 or 1:5000 of primary antibody P4 in primary

(800μl 
Lumino/Enhancer solution + 800μl Stable Peroxide solution for each

Blot off the excess PBST very gently and transfer membrane to a clean 
glass surface. 
 
Add chemiluminescence Super Signal West Femto to the surface of the 
membrane and distribute evenly, incubate for 5 minutes at room 
temperature.  
 
Blot off the excess substrate and transfer to a clean polythene surface.  
Place the membrane into the Versa Doc 1000 imager or equivalent, 
equipped with the Quantity One software, and detect the light signal.  
 
Take a first image after 1 min of exposure.  Check that samples do not 
saturate the maximum light signal detectable by the imager (highlight 
saturated pixels in the “transform” dialog of the Quantity One software).  
Take a shorter exposure if any sample contain saturated pixels and then 
proceed with longer exposures, up to 20 mins.  
 
 
Data Analysis 
 
The method described allows the quantification of the molecular weight of 
the non-glycosylated band and the SAF84/P4 ratio relative to the scrapie 
control.  
 
Ensure that signals to be analysed do not contain saturated pixels. 
 
Samples negative or weakly positive, so that the non-glycosylated 
band is not clearly identified in the blot, should be retested after PrPsc 
concentration (see Sample concentration). 
 
The molecular weight is measured on the SAF84 blot, by comparison with 
molecular weight standard run in three lanes of each gel.  
 
Define the 10 lanes by means of the “frame lanes” dialog of Quantity One 
software and then edit the frame to follow the lanes. 
 
Automatically detect bands (“detect bands” command) and then remove all 
bands with the exception of the non-glycosylated bands.  Do not remove

bands from the molecular weight standard lanes and ensure that all protein 
standards are detected in these lanes. 
 
Select the standards (match>standards), previously inserted into the 
Quantity One software, and apply to the three standard lanes.  See the 
molecular weight of the test lanes (band attributes>molecular weight). 
 
Save the image and record the molecular weight of each sample, or print 
the report “all lanes report”. 
 
The SAF84/P4 ratio is the ratio of the chemiluminescence signal produced 
by a given sample when revealed separately with SAF84 and P4 
monoclonal antibodies relative to the SAF84/P4 ratio of the control scrapie, 
and is measured by parallel measurements of replica blots developed with 
SAF84 and P4.  These analyses are made by means of the “volume tools”.  
A volume is the total signal intensity inside a defined rectangle drawn on the 
image. 
 
Select the “volume rectangle tool” in the “volume menu”.  Draw a rectangle 
surrounding the three PrPSc bands for each sample and the scrapie 
control.  Draw three rectangles in representative background regions of the 
blot.  Double click on these three rectangles and select the “background” 
option. 
 
Quantitate volumes using the “volume analysis report”.  Select the options 
“name” and “adjusted volume”, and “global” as background subtraction.  
When done, the software will display the analysis report.  Save the image 
and record the volumes of each sample with measured in the two blots (or 
print the “volume analysis report” for both, the SAF84 and the P4 blots). 
 
In order to obtain the SAF84/P4 ratio, calculate the absolute ratio of 
SAF84/P4 volumes for each sample and the scrapie control and then divide 
the absolute ratio of each sample by the absolute ratio of the scrapie 
control. 
 
Check that the data obtained following computer analysis are 
consistent with those observed by careful visual inspection of the 
blot. 
 
 
Interpretation  
(see annex 2 of this section) 
 
Samples with a molecular weight lower than the scrapie control of

kDa and with a SAF84/P4 ratio lower than 2 do not lead to further action. 
 
Negative or very weakly positive samples with should be retested after 
PrPSc concentration (see Sample concentration) 
 
Atypical Nor98 samples give very weak signals with SAF84 and are 
characterised by the presence of a band of 11-12 kDa, detected only by P4.  
For these samples the analyses of the molecular weight and the SAF84/P4 
ratio cannot be done.  Nevertheless, samples with these characteristics are 
not suspect and do not lead to further action. 
 
For repeatedly negative samples or very weak positive samples with 
SAF84, the interpretation of the apparent molecular weight of the non-
glycosylated band can be impossible.  Nevertheless, if the signal with P4 is 
stronger than the signal with SAF84, suspicion of BSE can be excluded. 
 
Samples very strongly positive (compared to the scrapie control) may 
occasionally give a SAF84/P4 ratio slightly higher than 2, while their 
molecular weight is similar to the scrapie control.  These samples should be 
retested diluted. 
 
Samples of bovine BSE (see annex 2 as an example) give no signal with P4 
and thus the SAF84/P4 ratio give very high values.  The molecular weight of 
bovine BSE is lower than scrapie control and higher then experimental BSE 
in sheep.

THE APHA BIO-RAD TeSeE-BASED HYBRID WESTERN BLOT 
METHOD 
 
 
INTRODUCTION 
 
The Bio-Rad TeSeE Western blot assay is a commercially available test kit that 
allows for the detection of PrPSc in nervous or peripheral tissues collected from 
infected animals (bovine, ovine, caprine and cervids), which can be distinguished 
from normal PrP, both by its protease resistance and molecular size. This 
abnormal protein is a unique identifier of Transmissible Spongiform 
Encephalopathy (TSE). This test has been developed as a confirmatory test of 
initial reactive samples identified by rapid screening tests and uses single 
antibody detection. 
 
The assay procedure includes the following steps: Sample homogenisation, 
digestion of PrPc with Proteinase K, purification and concentration of PrPSc, 
electrophoretic migration of the protein and transfer onto a membrane, 
immunoblotting and detection of signal.  
Here, this confirmatory test is used with a double antibody detection method 
which enables discrimination to be made between cases of natural bovine BSE, 
natural ovine scrapie, and experimental BSE and natural scrapie in sheep.

PROCEDURE/METHOD 
Planning 
A positive bovine classical BSE and positive classical ovine scrapie are always 
included on each run to validate the processing. Molecular mass markers are 
always included to allow for analysis of the banding patterns and molecular mass 
determination. The number of samples to be processed will vary on each run 
depending on the submissions and additional controls may be added if the 
samples are unusual and further examination required. The gel plan will be 
prepared to include all samples to be examined and relevant controls required. 
 
Each gel is duplicated so that matching membranes will be produced to probe 
with different antibodies. This enables a comparison for each sample between its 
affinities for two antibodies targeted at different epitopes of the prion protein. 
An example of a gel plan is shown in Fig 2.  
 
Sample Purification   
(Note: This stage is carried out in an appropriate safety cabinet according to National 
Safety Regulations) 
 
Sampling and homogenisation: 
Dissect and deposit 350mg ± 40mg of brain tissue in a grinding tube. 
Grind the sample in the Ribolyser for 45 sec at a speed of 6.5 for neural tissue.  
Mix by inversion. Aspirate 500µl with a calibration syringe. 
Transfer each 500µl into a 2ml micro-test tube.  
Sample Digestion 
Distribute 500µl of reconstituted proteinase K solution (see kit insert for method) into 
each micro-test tube and mix thoroughly by inversion (10 times).  
Incubate at 37°C ± 2°C for 10 mins. 
Precipitation of PrPSc and concentration  
Distribute 500µl of reagent B into each tube and mix thoroughly by inversion (10 
times) 
Centrifuge at 15 000g at 20°C for 7 minutes. 
 
Sample Clarifying 
Discard the supernatant and dry the tube for 5 mins by inversion.  
(Note: Use a disposable cotton bud to remove any excess liquid from the tube 
and lid, taking care not to disturb the pellet).

Version 8.1 January 2018 
TSE EURL Reviewed: 22/01/2018 
 
 
Distribute 100µl of Laemmlli solution (see kit insert for method) and incubate for 5 mins 
at room temperature (18°C to 30°C). 
 
Completely resolubilise the pellet by aspiration/dispensing with a pipette. 
Incubate at 100°C ± 5°C for 5 minutes, then homogenise by vortexing. 
 
Centrifuge the tubes for 15 mins at 15,000g at 20°C. 
Transfer the supernatant into a new micro-test tube. The procedure can be split 
over 2 processing days at this point and the denatured sample frozen at -20°C for 
24 hours. The samples should be thawed prior to use. 
Protein Separation 
(Note: This stage is carried out in a safety cabinet) 
 
Gel preparation  
Remove the plastic strip on the bottom of the plate and place the gels in the 
migration tank.  
 
Pour the MOPS x 1 migration buffer (see kit insert for method) on each side of the gel 
up to the top of the wells and into the Criterion XT Cell electrophoresis migration 
tank. Remove the combs and rinse each well with migration buffer. 
 
Heat the samples and known controls at 100°C ± 5°C for 4 minutes. 
 
Immediately load 15µl of each sample per well according to the gel plan.  
 
Load 5µl of Sigma Biotinylated Marker diluted 1:4 in Laemmlli Buffer and heated 
at 37’C for 2 hours as per reagent instructions (or other markers according to 
their specific instructions) in the outer most wells each side. 
 
Repeat the loading on another gel, to give a duplicate gel that is identically 
loaded and can be probed with a different antibody. 
 
Run the gels at room temperature (18°C to 30°C) for 50 minutes at 200V. 
 
Protein Transfer 
Protein Transfer preparation 
Cut the membrane to the gel dimensions. Label each membrane in the corner so 
they can be correctly identified at a later stage. 
Immerse the membranes in pure ethanol for 15 seconds. 
Rinse in distilled water for 5mins 
Equilibrate in transfer buffer (see kit insert for method) for 10 minutes. 
 
Gel sandwich preparation 
Equilibrate the gel in transfer buffer for 10mins. 
Pre-soak the fibre pads and filter paper in transfer buffer.  
Respectively place on the red side of the cassette: fibre pad, filter paper,

membrane, gel, filter paper, and fiber pad. 
 
Transfer onto PVDF membrane  
Fill the Criterion XT blotter to the indicated limit with approximately 1.5Lof transfer 
buffer. Place an ice pad in the holder of the transfer tank and run with agitation 
using a magnetic stirrer for 60mins at 115V. 
Immunoblotting 
Upon completion of transfer, open the blotting assembly and remove the 
membranes for development. Soak membranes in Wash solution 2 (see kit insert for 
method) then in pure Ethanol for 10 seconds. Rinse in distilled water for 5mins. 
Incubate the membrane to be detected with the kit antibody (SHA31) in 40ml of 
blocking solution (see kit insert for method) for 30mins under medium agitation.  
Incubate the membrane to be detected with P4 in 50ml of Bio-rad non-fat milk 
blocking reagent blocking solution for 30mins under medium agitation (Make up a 
5% solution with Wash solution 1 and dissolve for at least 1 hour before use). 
Note:  The non-kit Bio-rad Non-fat milk blocking reagent is used for probing with 
any other primary antibodies. Make up a 5% solution with Wash solution 1 and 
dissolve for at least 1 hour before use. 
Dilute the kit primary antibody  (see kit insert for method)  
 
Dilute the P4 primary antibody 1:5000 (1mg/ml stock solution). 
(5µl mAb P4 in 25mls Wash solution1). 
 
Eliminate the blocking solution from both membranes. 
 
Incubate the first membrane in 30ml of diluted kit primary antibody SHA31 at 
18°C to 30°C for 30 mins under medium agitation. 
Incubate the second membrane in 25ml of diluted mAb P4 primary antibody at 
18°C to 30°C for 60 mins under medium agitation. 
To allow all membranes to be taken through the washing and detection stages 
together, the SHA31 membrane should be placed at +4°C for a further 30mins 
whilst the P4 membrane continues to the end of the 60 mins incubation period. 
Using Wash solution 1, briefly rinse then wash twice for respectively 5 and 10 
mins under fast agitation (100ml per membrane and per cycle). 
Dilute the kit secondary antibody for the SHA 31 membrane (see kit insert for method). 
 
Dilute the secondary antibody for the P4 membrane, Bio-rad Goat Anti-Mouse 
HRP 1:5000. (10µl in 50mls Wash solution1). 
 
Note:  If using Sigma Biotinylated Markers add Sigma HRP (dilution 1:30 000).

Incubate the membranes in the appropriate diluted secondary antibody at 18°C to 
30°C for 20mins under medium agitation. 
Using wash solution 1, briefly rinse then wash three times respectively for 5, 10 
and 10mins under fast agitation (100ml per membrane and per cycle). Place the 
membrane in Wash solution 2 under medium agitation. 
 
Prepare ECL Substrate reagent (see kit insert for method).  
Eliminate the wash solution 2 and drain the membrane on absorbent paper 
without blotting. Place the dried membrane onto a plastic transparency and add 
the substrate solution. Cover with another transparency and distribute the 
solution evenly over the membrane eliminating excess and air bubbles. Incubate 
for 1min.  
 
 
Signal detection using a CCD imager 
 
Blot away any excess liquid on the transparency before placing it into the Imager. 
Place the membrane into the Bio-Rad Multi–Imager and detect the light signal 
using 1 & 10 minute exposures. 
The membrane should be exposed until a strong signal of the positive control is 
visible. 
Expose longer or shorter times for optimal signal visualisation. 
Label the blot with sample and control details from gel loading plan and also 
include run number, method of processing, antibody and detection time, and 
operator initials and date. 
 
 
Signal detection using x-ray film 
 
Place the development folder in the x-ray cassette and turn off the safelight. 
 
Place a sheet of x-ray film on top of the membrane and close the cassette.  
Expose the membrane to the X-ray film. The actual exposure time will vary 
according to the samples processed and the suggested time is 15mins. Expose 
the film longer or shorter times to achieve optimal signal visualisation. 
 
Place the film in a tray of x-ray developer solution for 45 seconds with occasional 
agitation. 
Wash the film for 1 minute in a tray of tap water 
Place the film in x-ray fixer until the film becomes transparent. 
 
Thoroughly wash the film in distilled water and then hang the film up to dry.

INTERPRETATION OF THE APHA BIO-RAD BASED-HYBRID WESTERN 
IMMUNOBLOT RESULTS 
  
This method is capable of identifying PrPSc profiles associated with classical 
bovine BSE, atypical H and L-type bovine BSE, classical ovine scrapie, 
atypical ovine scrapie and experimental BSE in sheep. 
 
Using this Western blot method with monoclonal antibodies SHA31 and P4, clear but subtle 
differences in the molecular weight position and antibody affinity are observed between the 
different PrPSc profiles described in the summary. A representative image of each type is 
shown below in figures 1a-d. 
 
A negative sample will have been totally digested by proteinase K and no signal will be 
visualised with either antibody, illustrated in figure 1b (lane 4). 
 
Any samples that give a banding profile that is not consistent with either 
classical or atypical scrapie should be referred to the EURL for a second 
opinion and further investigation where necessary. 
 
LIMITATIONS OF THE TEST 
 
 
The method requires sufficient tissue from the optimal brain area, in order to 
maximize the amount of PrPSc loaded from each sample. 
o If the quantities of brain material are too low (a situation we have 
encountered with active surveillance), the number of Western blots that could 
be run from a single sample may not be sufficient to obtain an accurate 
interpretation and there may not be enough PrPSc in underweight samples to 
confirm a diagnosis even though the sample may be positive. 
  
 
It is important to compare the molecular weights of samples, relative to each other 
and the controls on the same gel.  
 
 
Care must be taken in interpretation, as samples that have not been digested 
correctly may initially appear positive. These should be repeated. 
 
 
Strong positive samples may give a saturated signal intensity which will obscure 
visual interpretation of the banding profile. This type of sample requires repeat 
immunoblotting following dilution, so a clear banding pattern is observed. 
 
 
The full banding profile may not be visualised in weaker samples or where the 
optimal tissue for atypical scrapie has not been submitted. 
 
 
Atypical TSE’s differ in their PrPSc distribution and so the correct brain area is critical 
for clear, accurate results e.g. medulla for classical scrapie and cerebellum for 
atypical scrapie. 
 
We have shown that differences in the ovine genotype do not appear to give any variation in 
the banding obtained for scrapie samples but autolysed samples can run quicker through 
the gel and may resulting in a lower molecular weight than the equivalent fresh sample. At 
present we do not know whether mAb P4 results are affected by autolysis.  
 
We have only assessed certain genotypes of experimental sheep-BSE and some molecular 
weight variability of natural sheep-BSE, if it is in the ovine population, cannot be ruled out at 
this stage.

Although this test was capable of accurately discriminating the panel of blind samples 
supplied by the CRL, it is possible for a false positive BSE in sheep to be detected using 
this method, since some unusual scrapie samples can exhibit a BSE-like profile (e.g. 
CH1641). The purpose of the Bio-Rad TeSeE Western blot is for confirmation and, as such, 
purification buffers and antibodies were developed and selected for their sensitivity.  When 
strain typing was developed by CEA, the purpose was to cleave the octapeptide domain in 
BSE but maintain it for the other ovine prion strains. Unfortunately, the purification buffer 
from this confirmatory test was not protective enough for scrapie octapeptides: some 
unusual scrapie samples could be considered as BSE-like. A new purification buffer was 
developed for the Bio-Rad discriminatory kit, allowing a better protection of octapeptides in 
non-BSE samples. Moreover, the test used an anti-octapeptide antibody rather than the P4 
antibody, because the former epitope is clearly removed in ovine BSE while the P4 epitope 
can persist. Therefore, the perceived major risk of using Bio-rad TeSeE western blot 
coupled to SHA31 and P4 for strain typing may increase numbers of false BSE-like 
samples, However, any potential BSE type cases are referred to the Strain Typing Expert 
Group (STEG) for extensive investigation using alternative differential methods and this 
process will aid resolution of such cases if they occur.

Potential ‘L’ Type 
 
Visible signal with mAb SHA31. 
 
Molecular mass migration can be equivalent or lower than bovine control with 
mAb SHA31 
 
No signal with mAb P4. 
 
Reduction in the intensity of the di-glycosylated band compared to the 
monoglycosylated band. This may give the appearance of equal intensity of both 
bands or a predominance of the mono-glycosylated band. 
NB The glycoprofile can be difficult to determine if the signal is saturated, therefore 
dilution of the sample may be necessary.  
(See Fig 1b below) 
 
Atypical Ovine Scrapie: 
 
A multiple band profile is seen with mAb SHA31 and mAb P4.  
 
The bands show a significant downwards shift compared to the classical scrapie 
control with the fourth band being lower than 15kD (typically around 12kD). 
(See Fig 1c below)
