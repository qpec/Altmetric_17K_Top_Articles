 Global, Regional, and National Cancer Incidence,
Mortality, Years of Life Lost, Years Lived With Disability,
and Disability-Adjusted Life-Years for 29 Cancer Groups,
1990 to 2016
A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study
Global Burden of Disease Cancer Collaboration
IMPORTANCE The increasing burden due to cancer and other noncommunicable diseases
poses a threat to human development, which has resulted in global political commitments
reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals as well as the World Health Organization
(WHO) Global Action Plan on Non-Communicable Diseases. To determine if these
commitments have resulted in improved cancer control, quantitative assessments of the
cancer burden are required.
OBJECTIVE To assess the burden for 29 cancer groups over time to provide a framework for
policy discussion, resource allocation, and research focus.
EVIDENCE REVIEW Cancer incidence, mortality, years lived with disability, years of life lost,
and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were evaluated for 195 countries and territories by
age and sex using the Global Burden of Disease study estimation methods. Levels and trends
were analyzed over time, as well as by the Sociodemographic Index (SDI). Changes in incident
cases were categorized by changes due to epidemiological vs demographic transition.
FINDINGS In 2016, there were 17.2 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.9 million deaths.
Cancer cases increased by 28% between 2006 and 2016. The smallest increase was seen in
high SDI countries. Globally, population aging contributed 17%; population growth, 12%; and
changes in age-specific rates, −1% to this change. The most common incident cancer globally
for men was prostate cancer (1.4 million cases). The leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs
was tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer (1.2 million deaths and 25.4 million DALYs). For
women, the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs
was breast cancer (1.7 million incident cases, 535 000 deaths, and 14.9 million DALYs). In
2016, cancer caused 213.2 million DALYs globally for both sexes combined. Between 2006
and 2016, the average annual age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined
increased in 130 of 195 countries or territories, and the average annual age-standardized
death rates decreased within that timeframe in 143 of 195 countries or territories.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Large disparities exist between countries in cancer incidence,
deaths, and associated disability. Scaling up cancer prevention and ensuring universal access
to cancer care are required for health equity and to fulfill the global commitments for
noncommunicable disease and cancer control.

 T
he year 2017 marked another milestone in the global
commitment to control cancer. In May 2017, a new can-
cerresolutionwasadoptedduringthe70thWorldHealth
Assembly,1 suggesting that focused efforts are urgently needed
toachievethegoalsforthe2011PoliticalDeclarationonthePre-
vention and Control of NCDs (noncommunicable diseases)2,3
(25% reduction in premature mortality from NCDs) as well as
for the third Sustainable Development Goal (“by 2030 reduce
by one-third premature mortality from non-communicable
diseases [NCDs] through prevention and treatment, and
promote mental health and wellbeing”).4 Even with in-
creased awareness of the threat that NCDs pose to human de-
velopment, progress on NCD control has been slow in most
countries.5 This is despite the fact that we are now entering a
timewhenreductionsinmortalitywouldbeexpectedifthe2011
declaration had led to policy changes.5,6 Compared with other
health threats like human immunodeficiency virus, tubercu-
losis, or malaria, cancer represents many drastically different
diseases that require unique approaches for prevention, diag-
nosis, and treatment. Thus far, few countries have been able
to overcome this challenge. To achieve equitable cancer con-
trol over the next decade, continued commitment from all
stakeholders,appropriatefunding,andeffectiveapproachesare
necessary. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study pro-
vides data to direct efforts where they are most needed and to
identify progress and obstacles in cancer control.
In this study, we describe the burden of cancer using re-
sults from the GBD 2016 study for 29 cancer groups by sex, age,
and over time for 195 countries or territories.
Methods
Methods have remained similar to the GBD 2015 study.7 As in
each prior GBD study, the entire time series was reestimated,
and results presented in this study supersede prior GBD stud-
ies. All cancers as defined in the International Classification of
Diseases(ICD)werecategorizedinto29cancergroups.Changes
since GBD 2015 include new data additions, the addition of
“other leukemia” as a cause, changes in the mortality-to-
incidence ratio (MIR) estimation, as well as reporting esti-
mates for nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). For GBD 2016,
weestimatednationaldiseaseburdenfor195countriesandter-
ritories. Descriptions of the methods can be found in the GBD
2016 publications as well as in the eAppendix, eFigures, and
eTables in the Supplement.8-11 The GBD 2016 study is compli-
ant with GATHER guidelines (eTable 1 in the Supplement). All
rates are reported per 100 000 person-years. The GBD world
population standard was used for the calculation of age-
standardized rates.12 We report 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs)
for all estimates.
Estimation Framework
The GBD estimation process starts with cancer mortality. Data
sources for cancer mortality include vital registration system
(83% of data), cancer registry (14.4% of data), and verbal au-
topsydata(3%ofdata)(eTable2intheSupplement).Sincecan-
cer registries often exist in locations without cancer mortal-
ity data, cancer incidence data are used to model mortality by
multiplying incidence with a separately modeled MIR. These
mortality estimates are added to mortality data from the other
sources and used in a cause of death ensemble model
(CODEm).8,13 Each cancer type is estimated separately using
covariates with a causal connection (eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment). Final cancer-specific mortality estimates are divided
by the MIR to estimate cancer incidence. Ten-year cancer
prevalence is modeled using the MIR as a scalar to determine
country-specific survival. Years lived with disability (YLDs) are
estimated by dividing 10-year cancer prevalence into 4 se-
quelae: (1) diagnosis/treatment, (2) remission, (3) metastasic/
disseminated, and (4) terminal phase. Each sequela preva-
lence is multiplied by a disability weight to estimate YLDs. For
larynx, breast, colorectal, bladder, and prostate cancer, addi-
tional disability is estimated from procedures related to these
cancers. Years of life lost (YLLs) are estimated by multiplying
the estimated number of deaths by age with a standard life ex-
pectancy at that age.14 Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)
are calculated by summing YLDs and YLLs. As in GBD 2015,
we estimate the contribution of population aging, population
growth, and change in age-specific rates on the change in in-
cident cases between 2006 and 2016.7 We stratify results using
Sociodemographic Index (SDI) quintiles. The SDI is a compos-
ite indicator including fertility, education, and income, and it
has been shown to correlate well with health outcomes.7
Results
Global Incidence, Mortality, and DALYs
In 2016, there were 17.2 million (95% UI, 16.7-17.8 million) in-
cident cancer cases worldwide and 8.9 million (95% UI, 8.8-
9.1 million) cancer deaths (Table). Cancer caused 213.2 mil-
lion (95% UI, 208.5-217.6 million) DALYs in 2016, of which 98%
came from YLLs and 2% came from YLDs (eTable 15 and eFig-
ure 4 in the Supplement). Globally, the odds of developing can-
cer during a lifetime (age 0-79 years) differed by sex: they were
1 in 3 for men and 1 in 5 for women (eTable 16 in the Supple-
ment). These odds differ substantially among SDI quintiles
Key Points
Question What is the cancer burden over time at the global and
national levels measured in incidence, mortality, years lived with
disability, years of life lost, and disability-adjusted life-years
(DALYs)?
Findings In this systematic analysis, in 2016 there were 17.2
million incident cancer cases, 8.9 million deaths, and 213.2 million
DALYs due to cancer worldwide. Between 2006 and 2016,
incident cases increased by 28%, with the largest increase
occurring in the least developed countries.
Meaning To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals as well
as targets set in the World Health Organization Global Action Plan
on noncommunicable diseases, cancer control planning and
implementation as well as strategic investments are urgently
needed.

 ranging from 1 in 8 at the lowest SDI quintile to 1 in 2 at the
highest SDI quintile for men and from 1 in 8 in the lowest SDI
quintile to 1 in 3 in the highest quintile for women. In 2016,
prostate, TBL (tracheal, bronchus, and lung), and colorectal
cancer were the most common incident cancers in men—
accounting for 40% of all cancer cases. The most common
causes of cancer deaths for men were TBL, liver, and stomach
cancer (Table). The leading causes for cancer DALYs in 2016
were TBL, liver, and stomach cancer (Web Table 3; available
at http://ghdx.healthdata.org/node/350478). For women in
2016, the most common incident cancers were breast, colo-
rectal, and NMSC accounting for 40% of all incident cases. The
leading causes of cancer deaths and DALYs were breast, TBL,
and colorectal cancer (Web Table 3; http://ghdx.healthdata
.org/node/350478).
For childhood cancers (age 0-19 years), the most com-
mon cancers and causes of cancer deaths were other neo-
plasms (see eTables 4 and 5 in the Supplement for ICD codes
includedin“otherneoplasms”),brainandnervoussystemcan-
cers, and acute lymphoid leukemia (Figure 1 and Figure 2). For
adolescents and young adults (age 20-39 years) the most com-
mon cancers globally were breast cancer, cervical cancer, and
other neoplasms. The main causes of cancer deaths for this age
group were other neoplasms, brain and nervous system can-
cers, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. For the population older
than 39 years, the cancers contributing the most incident cases
were TBL, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer, while the
main contributors to cancer deaths were TBL, colorectal, and
stomach cancer.
Between 2006 and 2016, the average annual age-
standardized incidence rates (AAASIRs) forall cancers com-
bined increased in 130 of 195 countries (Figure 3). In contrast,
the average annual age-standardized death rates (AAASDRs)
for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in
143 of 195 countries (Figure 4). Countries with an increase in
AAASDR were largely located on the African continent and
Middle East. Between 2006 and 2016 the AAASDR decreased
in all SDI quintiles except for the low SDI quintile (eFigure 5
in the Supplement). The AAASDR decreased for most cancers
inthehigh,andhigh-middleSDIquintiles,whereasthechanges
in AAASDR were more heterogeneous for the other SDI quin-
tiles (eFigures 5-14 in the Supplement).
Incident cases for both sexes combined increased in all SDI
quintiles between 2006 and 2016 for nearly all cancers (eTable
14 in the Supplement and Web Table 1; http://ghdx.healthdata
.org/node/350478). The largest increase in cancer incident
cases between 2006 and 2016 occurred in middle SDI coun-
tries,witha38%increase,ofwhichchangingagestructurecon-
tributed 25%; population growth, 7%; and changing age-
specific incidence rates, 6%. The drivers behind increasing
cancer incidence differed substantially by SDI. Whereas in the
lowest SDI quintile, population growth was the major con-
tributor to the increase in total cancer incidence, in low-
middle SDI countries, population growth and aging contrib-
uted almost equally (16.6% and 15.3%, respectively), and in
high-middle, and high-income countries, increased inci-
dence was mainly driven by population aging (eTable 14 in the
Supplement).

 Global Top 10 Cancers in 2016
The global top 10 cancers were ranked by the highest number
of incident cases, excluding “other neoplasms” (Figure 5).
1. Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung Cancer
In 2016, there were 2.0 million (95% UI, 2.0-2.1 million) inci-
dent cases of TBL cancer and 1.7 million (95% UI, 1.7-1.8 mil-
lion) deaths; TBL cancer caused 36.4 million (95% UI, 35.4-
37.5 million) DALYs in 2016, of which 99% came from YLLs and
1%fromYLDs(eTable15andeFigure4intheSupplement).Men
were more likely to develop TBL cancer over a lifetime than
women (1 in 18 men, 1 in 46 women) (eTable 16 in the Supple-
ment). The odds were the highest in high SDI countries (1 in
14 men, 1 in 26 women). In low SDI countries, the odds were
substantially lower (1 in 75 men, 1 in 172 women); TBL cancer
was the leading cause of cancer globally and in high-middle
and middle SDI countries (Figure 5). It was the most common
cause of cancer deaths by absolute cases globally as well as in
allSDIquintiles,exceptforthelowSDIquintile,whereTBLcan-
cer ranked seventh (Figure 6). For men, TBL cancer was the
most common incident cancer in 42 countries and the most
common cause for cancer deaths in 108 countries (eFigures 17
and 19 in the Supplement). For women, TBL cancer was the
mostcommonincidentcancerin3countriesandthemostcom-
mon cause of cancer deaths in 25 countries (eFigures 18 and
20 in the Supplement).
Between 2006 and 2016, TBL cancer cases increased by
28% (95% UI, 25%-32%) (Web Table 1; http://ghdx.healthdata
.org/node/350478). Changing age structure contributed 19%,
and population growth, 12%. A decrease in age-specific inci-
dence partially offset this increase and would have led to a 3%
decrease in incidence if age structure and population size had
remained constant between 2006 and 2016 (eTable 14 and
eFigure 21 in the Supplement). ASIRs between 1990 and 2016
show diverging results between men and women globally and
in high and high-middle SDI countries, with the ASIR in men
decreasing but increasing in women. In middle SDI coun-
tries, ASIRs increased for both men and women but remained
stable in low-middle and low SDI countries (eFigures 23 and
24 in the Supplement).
2. Colon and Rectum Cancer
In 2016, there were 1.7 million (95% UI, 1.7-1.8 million) inci-
dent cases of colon and rectum cancer, and 830 000 (95% UI,
797 000-860 000) deaths (Table). Colon and rectum cancer
caused 17.2 million (95% UI, 16.5-17.9 million) DALYs in 2016,

 of which 97% came from YLLs and 3% from YLDs (eTable 15
and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). The odds of developing co-
lon and rectum cancer globally was higher for men than for
women (1 in 26 men, 1 in 41 women; eTable 16 in the Supple-
ment). The highest odds were in the high SDI quintile (1 in 15
men, 1 in 24 women), and the lowest in the low SDI quintile
(1 in 112 men, 1 in 116 women). Between 2006 and 2016, inci-
dence increased by 34% (95% UI, 28%-41%), from 1.3 million
(95% UI, 1.27-1.30 million) to 1.7 million (95% UI, 1.66-1.79 mil-
lion) cases (eTable 14 in the Supplement). Most of this in-
crease can be explained by an aging and growing population
(19% and 12%, respectively); however, even with the same
population size and age structure, colorectal cancer cases
would have increased by 2% between 2006 and 2016 due to
changingage-specificincidencerates.ASIRsbetween1990and
2016 were similar for men and women for all levels of SDI ex-
cept for the high-middle SDI quintile, where trends leveled off
in women but increased in men (eFigures 25 and 26 in the
Supplement). Between 2006 and 2016, for both sexes com-
bined, the ASIR and ASDR decreased in the high SDI quintile.
In the high-middle, and middle SDI quintile, the ASDR de-
creased but the ASIR increased, and for low-middle, and low
SDI countries, both ASIR and ASDR increased (eFigure 7 in the
Supplement).
3. Breast Cancer

cident cases in 2016. The vast majority occurred in women,
(1.68 million; 95% UI, 1.61-1.78 million) (Table). Breast cancer
was among the top 3 leading causes of cancer in all SDI quin-
tiles except for the high and middle SDI quintiles, where it was
the fifth and fourth most common cancer, respectively
(Figure5).Itcaused535 000(95%UI,506 000-573 000)deaths

YLDs (eTable 15 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Globally,
1 in 20 women developed breast cancer over a lifetime (eTable

breast cancer were the highest in high SDI countries (1 in 10),
andthelowestinlowSDIcountries(1in50).Forwomen,breast

 ture (contributing 16%), population growth (contributing 12%),
and an increase in age-specific incidence rates (contributing
1%) (eFigure 21 in the Supplement). Between 2006 and 2016,
ASIRs decreased or remained stable in high, and high-middle
SDI countries, but increased in the other SDI quintiles. ASDR
decreased within that timeframe in all SDI quintiles, except for
the low SDI quintile, where it increased (eFigure 8 in the
Supplement).
4. Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer
In 2016, there were 1.5 million (95% UI, 1.1-2.0 million) inci-
dent cases of NMSC, of which 886 000 (95% UI, 574 000-1.3
million) were due to basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 635 000
(95% UI, 386 000-922 000) due to squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC). There were 53 000 (95% UI, 51 000-55 000) deaths due
to NMSC (Table) and 1.0 million (95% UI, 981 000-1.1 million)
DALYs, of which 97% came from YLLs and 3% from YLDs
(eTable 15 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Over a lifetime,
the odds of developing NMSC were 1 in 31 for men and 1 in 50
for women globally. For SCC in men, it ranged from 1 in 458 in
low-middle SDI countries to 1 in 24 in high SDI countries; and
for BCC, from 1 in 241 in low-middle SDI countries to 1 in 29 in
high SDI countries (eTable 16 in the Supplement). An aging and
growing population has led to a 12% (95% UI, 6%-19%) in-
crease in NMSC cancer cases, from 1.4 million (95% UI,
999 000-1.8 million) in 2006-1.5 million (95% UI, 1.1-2.0 mil-
lion) in 2016. The majority of this increase (20%) can be at-
tributed to a change in the population age structure. Twelve
percent can be attributed to population growth. Part of this in-
crease was offset by a decrease in age-specific incidence rates
between 2006 and 2016, which would have led to a 20% de-
crease in overall incidence of NMSC if the age structure and
population size had remained stable during this timeframe
(eTable 14 and eFigure 21 in the Supplement).
5. Prostate Cancer
In 2016, there were 1.4 million (95% UI, 1.3-1.6 million) inci-
dent cases of prostate cancer and 381 000 (95% UI, 321 000-
413 000) deaths. Prostate cancer caused 6.1 million (95% UI,
5.0-6.6 million) DALYs globally in 2016, with 91% coming from
YLLs and 9% from YLDs (eTable 15 and eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment). Globally, the odds of developing prostate cancer was
1 in 16 ranging from 1 in 56 for low-middle SDI countries to 1 in
7 in high SDI countries (eTable 16 in the Supplement). In 2016,
prostate cancer was the cancer with the highest incidence for
men in 92 countries, and the leading cause of cancer deaths
for men in 48 countries (eFigures 17 and 19 in the Supple-
ment). The increasing incidence rates, together with an aging
and growing population, have led to a 40% increase in pros-
tate cancer cases since 2006: 1.0 million (95% UI, 942 000-
1.1 million) in 2006 to 1.4 million (95% UI, 1.3-1.6 million) in
2016. Twenty percent of this increase can be attributed to a

6. Stomach Cancer
In 2016, there were 1.2 million (95% UI, 1.1-1.2 million) inci-
dent cases of stomach cancer and 834 000 (95% UI, 814 000-
855 000) deaths worldwide. Stomach cancer caused 18.3 mil-
lion(95%UI,17.9-18.9million)DALYsin2016,with98%coming
from YLLs and 2% coming from YLDs (eTable 15 and eFigure
4 in the Supplement). One in 32 men and 1 in 80 women de-
veloped stomach cancer over a lifetime. The highest odds for
men were in middle SDI countries (1 in 24), and the lowest in
low SDI countries (1 in 90). For women, the highest odds were
in high-middle SDI countries (1 in 69) and the lowest in low
SDI countries (1 in 140) (eTable 16 in the Supplement). Be-
tween 2006 and 2016, stomach cancer moved from the sec-
ond leading cause of crude cancer YLLs to the third place with
a 4% decrease (−4% change; 95% UI, −6.5% to −1.5%) in abso-
luteYLLs(Figure7).Overall,incidencebetween2006and2016
increased by 15%, of which a change in the population age
structure contributed 18%; population growth, 12%; and fall-
ing age-specific rates, −15%. (eTable 14 and eFigure 21 in the
Supplement). ASIRs have dropped substantially since 1990
globally and for all SDI quintiles (eFigures 31 and 32 in the
Supplement).
7. Liver Cancer
In 2016, there were 1.0 million (95% UI, 953 000-1.0 million)
incident cases of liver cancer globally and 829 000 (95% UI,
796 000-858 000) deaths. Liver cancer caused 21.1 million
(95% UI, 20.3-22.0 million) DALYs in 2016, with 99% coming
from YLLs and 1% coming from YLDs (eTable 15 and eFigure 4
in the Supplement). Globally, liver cancer was more common
inmen,with1in38mendevelopinglivercancercomparedwith
1 in 111 women. The highest odds of developing liver cancer
were in middle SDI countries (1 in 26 men, 1 in 76 women),
whereas the lowest were seen in low-middle SDI countries
(1 in 93 men, 1 in 195 women) (eTable 16 in the Supplement).
Population aging and population growth were the drivers of
the increase from 732 000 (95% UI, 702 000-747 000) cases
in 2006 to 1.0 million (95% UI, 953 000-1.0 million) cases in
2016 (eTable 14 and eFigure 21 in the Supplement). Of the 38%
increase in cases between 2006 and 2016, 16% was due to
population aging, 12% due to population growth, and 9% due
to an increase in age-specific incidence rates. Trends in ASIRs
for liver cancer differ by SDI quintile. For women, rates de-
creased in the middle, low-middle, and low SDI quintiles,
whereas they increased in the high SDI quintile (eFigure 33 in
the Supplement). The same increase in the high SDI quintile
can be seen in men (eFigure 34 in the Supplement). Between
2006 and 2016, ASIRs for both sexes increased in the high,
high-middle, and middle SDI countries but decreased in the

8. Cervical Cancer
In 2016, 511 000 (95% UI, 414 000-542 000) women devel-
oped cervical cancer worldwide, and it caused 247 000 (95%
UI, 204 000-263 000) deaths (Table). Cervical cancer caused
7.4 million (95% UI, 6.0-7.9 million) DALYs, with 97% coming
from YLLs and 3% from YLDs (eTable 15 and eFigure 4 in the
Supplement). Globally, 1 in 75 women developed cervical
cancer during a lifetime (eTable 16 in the Supplement). The
odds were the highest in low SDI countries (1 in 31), and the
lowest in high SDI countries (1 in 117). Cervical cancer was
the most common cause for cancer incidence and death in low
SDI countries (Web Table 4; http://ghdx.healthdata.org/node
/350478). In 2016, cervical cancer was the most common in-
cident cancer for women in 51 countries (eFigure 18 in the
Supplement) and the most common cause of cancer deaths in
42 countries (eFigure 20 in the Supplement). Between 2006
and 2016, incident cases increased by 9% (95% UI, 2%-17%)
globally. Population growth contributed 12%, and population
aging, 11%, while falling age-specific incidence rates offset this
increase by −15% (eFigure 21 and eTable 14 in the Supple-
ment).Deathsincreasedby7%(95%UI,1%-15%)between2006
and 2016, and DALYs by 5% (95% UI, −1% to 13%) (Web Table
1; http://ghdx.healthdata.org/node/350478). ASIRs de-
creased globally, and for all SDI quintiles (eFigure 35 in the
Supplement).
9. Leukemia
In 2016, there were 467 000 (95% UI, 423 000-489 000) new
cases of leukemia worldwide and 310 000 (95% UI, 286 000-
324 000) deaths. In 2016, leukemia caused 10.2 million (95%
UI, 9.3-10.8 million) DALYs globally, with 98% coming from
YLLs and 2% from YLDs (eTable 15 and eFigure 4 in the Supple-
ment). Globally, 1 in 118 men compared with 1 in 194 women
developed leukemia. Between 2006 and 2016, incident cases

 increased by 26% from 370 000 (95% UI, 344 000-385 000)
to 467 000 (95% UI, 423 000-489 000). The main contribu-
tors to this increase were population growth with 12%, popu-
lation aging with 10%, and an increase in age-specific inci-
dence rates with 3% (eFigure 21 and eTable 14 in the
Supplement). ASIR trends between 1990 and 2016 for women
showed decreasing trends in the low-middle SDI and low SDI
quintiles but increasing trends over the last decade in high-
middle and middle SDI quintiles (eFigure 36 in the Supple-
ment). For men, rates remained stable between 1990 and 2016
in middle, low-middle, and low SDI countries but increased in
high SDI and high-middle SDI countries (eFigure 37 in the
Supplement).
10. Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma
In 2016, there were 461 000 (95% UI, 428 000-482 000) inci-
dent cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 240 000 (95% UI,
221 000-248 000)deaths.Non-Hodgkinlymphomacaused6.8
million (95% UI, 6.2-7.1 million) DALYs in 2016, with 98% com-
ing from YLLs and 2% from YLDs (eTable 15 and eFigure 4 in
the Supplement). Globally, 1 in 110 men and 1 in 161 women
developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma over a lifetime. The high-
est odds were in high SDI countries (1 in 48 for men, 1 in 70 for
women), and the lowest were in low-middle SDI countries
(1 in 274 for men, 1 in 401 for women) (eTable 16 in the Supple-
ment). Globally, incident cases between 2006 and 2016 in-
creased by 45% (95% UI, 38%-48%), of which 17% was due to
increasing age-specific incidence rates, 15% to changing popu-
lation age structure, and 12% to population growth (eTable 14
and eFigure 21 in the Supplement). In eFigures 38 and 39 in
theSupplement,theslightincreaseinASIRsbetween1990and
2016 is shown, with very similar trends for men and women
and all SDI quintiles except for the high SDI quintile, where
ASIRs increase more rapidly.
Trends in Incidence for Less Common Cancers
Globally, incident cases for all cancers increased significantly
between 2006 and 2016 for both sexes combined. Of the can-
cers other than the top 10, the top 3 cancers with the largest in-
creaseinincidentcaseswerethyroidcancer(50%increase;95%
UI, 43%-59%; uterine cancer (40% increase; 95% UI, 34%-
50%); and melanoma (39% increase; 95% UI, 33%-43%) (Web
Table 1; http://ghdx.healthdata.org/node/350478). For thyroid
cancer, of the 50% increase, 25% can be explained by rising
age-specific incidence rates, 12% by an increase in population
size, and 12% by a change in age structure. For uterine cancer,
of the 40% increase, 18% was due to a change in the popula-
tion age structure, 12% to an increase in population size, and
10% to a rise in age-specific incidence rates. For melanoma, of
the 39% increase, 15% was due to a change in the population
age-structure, 12% to population growth, and 11% to a change
in age-specific incidence rates (eTable 14 in the Supplement).
Discussion
We updated our previous reports and analyzed cancer regis-
try, vital registration, and verbal autopsy data to estimate the
burden of cancer for 195 countries and territories from 1990
to 2016.7,15 In this article, we focus on the changes over the last
decade (2006-2016). All results presented can also be found
onlineathttps://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/.Changes
compared with our previous reports include the addition of
NMSC, additional data sources (eTable 3 in the Supplement),
and improvements in the estimation of the MIR.
We found that the global cancer burden between 2006 and
2016 increased in terms of incident cases, deaths, and DALYs,
with vast heterogeneity by cancer type, location, and sex. A
large proportion of the increase in cancer incidence can be ex-
plainedbyimprovinglifeexpectancyandpopulationgrowth—a
development that can at least partially be attributed to a re-
duced burden from other common diseases.8,14 However, the
contribution of population aging vs population growth to
changes in incident cases differs substantially based on socio-
economic development. This leads to very different compo-
sitions of cancer types contributing to total incident cases in
a population depending on the age structure.
Despite the rapidly increasing cancer burden in lower
SDI countries, the odds of developing cancer and age-
standardized rates are still higher in countries of higher SDI.
Notable exceptions are cancers with infectious etiologies like
cervical, liver, and stomach cancer.
Infectious Causes for Cancer
Cervicalcanceristhemoststrikingexampleofinequityforcan-
cers of infectious etiologies, where women in low SDI coun-
tries are almost 4 times more likely to develop cervical can-
cer compared with women in high SDI countries, and where
cervical cancer is the most common cause of cancer inci-
dence and deaths. A positive development is that cervical
cancer ASIRs have fallen in all SDI quintiles, likely due to im-
provements in primary and secondary prevention as well as
improvements in SDI.16 However, with almost a quarter mil-
lion women still dying annually from a preventable cancer,
much work is left to be done.17
Stomach and liver cancer are another example of the large
heterogeneity in the burden of cancers with infectious etiolo-
gies. As is the case with cervical cancer, a positive develop-
ment is that stomach cancer rates have fallen in all SDI quin-
tiles over the last decade. Liver cancer is the leading cause of
cancer deaths in many lower SDI countries but only the sev-
enth leading cause of cancer deaths in high SDI countries. A
concerning trend, however, is that rates in higher SDI coun-
tries are increasing, which has been attributed to increasing
riskfactorslikenonalcoholicsteatohepatitis,alcoholabuse,and
hepatitis B and C in certain populations.18-20
Potential for Cancer Prevention
The mostly positive development for cancers with an infec-
tious etiology can at least partially be attributed to the large
prevention potential. Common cancers without infectious eti-
ologies but also with a large prevention potential include TBL
cancer through tobacco control; colorectal cancer through
screening, dietary interventions, and the promotion of physi-
cal activity; and skin cancer through prevention of excessive
UV exposure. For TBL cancer, ASIRs in higher SDI countries

 have decreased over the last decade, which can be attributed
to tobacco control.21 However, even though TBL cancer rates
in lower SDI countries are below the rates in higher SDI coun-
tries,ASIRsinlowerSDIcountriesincreasedbetween2006and
2016. This highlights the importance of focusing tobacco con-
trol efforts on lower SDI countries, to avoid these countries’
havingtoexperiencethesametragedyofunnecessarytobacco-
related deaths that many high SDI countries have had to face.
In addition to tobacco control, indoor and outdoor air pollu-
tion have to be considered as important risk factors for lung
cancerincertainlocations.11Whenconsideringthevalueofpre-
vention strategies, the benefit in reducing diseases other than
cancer can be considerable, as is the case for example with
tobacco control.
Unfortunately, cancer prevention efforts are less effec-
tiveforcommoncancerslikebreastandprostatecancer,aswell
as hematological malignant conditions like leukemia and non-
Hodgkin lymphoma, and pediatric cancers. Also, cancer pre-
vention always has to be seen in conjunction with expanding
access to early detection and treatment to not neglect co-
horts of current or future patients for whom cancer preven-
tion efforts come too late.
Need for Access to Cancer Care
Since even in the best-case scenario only a fraction of cancers
are preventable under current conditions, providing universal
access to health care is crucial for cancer control.11 Especially
thefindingofincreasingASIRsforsomecancersatthesametime
as ASDRs are decreasing in higher SDI countries, which points
to the benefits of early cancer detection and effective treat-
ment but also highlights the potential for overdiagnosis.22
Globally, most of the cancer burden still comes from YLLs
rather than YLDs, reflecting a higher burden of deaths than dis-
ability. However, as cancer treatment improves and the popu-
lation ages, survivorship care becomes an essential part of the
cancer continuum. Over the last decade, resource-stratified
guidelines that encompass this continuum from diagnosis
throughsurvivorshiptoend-of-lifecarehavebeendeveloped.23
Together with the GBD estimates and other data on the local
burden of cancer, these guidelines provide countries helpful
tools when designing health policies and cancer control plans.
Limitations
For effective cancer control and resource allocation, informa-
tion on the local cancer burden but also on the burden of other
diseases is crucial. The GBD estimates fill a gap where actual
data on disease burden are sparse or unavailable. However, in
these cases, estimates have wide uncertainty, and it remains
crucial to improve data collection through the expansion and
creation of vital registration systems, cancer registries, health
surveys, and other data systems. Differences in data collec-
tion practices and coding systems, as well as quality of data
sources,remainmajorchallenges,asdounderreportingofcan-
cers requiring advanced diagnostics in low-resource settings
(eg,braincancer,leukemias,andothers).Cancersthatarecom-
mon in the pediatric population but rare in adults are aggre-
gated to an “other neoplasm” group, encompassing about 30%
of the pediatric cancer burden and making these estimates less
valuable for cancer control.
Conclusions
With the annual updates of the GBD cancer estimates, our goal
is to provide relevant and current information on the global,
regional, and national burden of cancer. The GBD 2016 study
offers new insights into the magnitude of cancer disparities.
Withpopulationagingandtheepidemiologicaltransition,can-
cer incidence will increase in the future, further widening the
cancer divide if current trends continue. The data showing
the disparities and knowledge on the root causes exist, as do
the tools to reduce them. However, strategic investments in
cancer control and implementation of effective programs to
ensure universal access to cancer care are required to achieve
the Sustainable Development Goals as well as targets set in the
WHO Global Action Plan on NCDs.
