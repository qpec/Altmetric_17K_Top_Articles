Abstract
Background
Personal fitness trackers (PFT) have substantial potential to improve healthcare.
Objective
To quantify and characterize early adopters who shared their PFT data with providers.
Methods
We used bivariate statistics and logistic regression to compare patients who shared any
PFT data vs. patients who did not.
Results
A patient portal was used to invite 79,953 registered portal users to share their data. Of
66,105 users included in our analysis, 499 (0.8%) uploaded data during an initial 37-day
study period. Bivariate and regression analysis showed that early adopters were more likely
than non-adopters to be younger, male, white, health system employees, and to have higher
BMIs. Neither comorbidities nor utilization predicted adoption.
Conclusion
Our results demonstrate that patients had little intrinsic desire to share PFT data with their
providers, and suggest that patients most at risk for poor health outcomes are least likely to
share PFT data. Marketing, incentives, and/or cultural change may be needed to induce
such data-sharing.

 Background and Significance
In late 2014, 64% of US adults owned smartphones.[1] Most new smartphones can be used
with or without complementary PFTs to help automate acquisition of biometric data, includ-
ing step and stair counts, body weight, heart rate, and blood pressure. Furthermore, standalone
PFTs are increasingly used by the general public to track biometric data. Such data has incredi-
ble potential for characterizing, tracking, and ultimately improving patients’ health.[2] How-
ever, one small study suggested that people with chronic illnesses were much less likely to use
such devices, as compared to healthy people.[3] We sought to evaluate the willingness of large
populations to share PFT data with healthcare providers via their electronic health records
(EHR), which might allow providers to leverage this data to provide better healthcare. After
inviting 79,953 patients to sync their PFTs to an EHR for continuous uploading of PFT data,
we compared patients who synced their PFTs with those who did not. To develop a priori
hypotheses and guide our comparison of demographic, health, and socioeconomic characteris-
tics of both groups of patients, we consulted the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and
Use of Technology [4] and existing literature on health information technology and patient
portal adoption.
Methods
This study utilized the patient portal of CS-Link, Cedars-Sinai Health System’s (CSHS) brand-
ing of the EpicCare enterprise EHR product (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, WI). CS-Link
is used at a large, non-profit hospital and at many local associated provider organizations both
within and outside CSHS. These organizations provide multidisciplinary care across the care
continuum to a socioeconomically diverse population.
To move towards an organizational goal of driving patient engagement and use of an
existing patient portal, CSHS began inviting patients to sync PFTs on April 25, 2015. All
registered patient portal users received a message entitled “Syncing your Wearable Devices
With My CS-Link” stating “You can now sync data from your own personal health devices
with your Cedars-Sinai medical record using My CS-LinkTM. Click HERE to learn more.”
Users also received an email indicating a new portal message. All applications and devices
compatible with the Apple HealthKit, Fitbit, and Withings software frameworks were
supported.
We began our analysis by reviewing the literature to generate a priori hypotheses regard-
ing which patient characteristics would predict device syncing.[4–11] Because we found few
studies of PFT adoption, we also extrapolated from study of health information technology
in general, and of patient portals specifically. Our review suggested that compared to non-
adopters, patients choosing to share PFT data would be more likely to be younger, white,
non-Hispanic, English-speaking, insured, higher income, employed, sicker, and higher uti-
lizers of healthcare.
Next, we determined which patients had uploaded PFT data via synced devices by June 1,
2015. We queried the EHR and other electronic sources of administrative data to obtain the
necessary data elements. We excluded patients without any portal logins during January 1,
2015–April 24, 2015, patients not 18–89 years old, and patients with at least one missing or
clearly erroneous data element. We used bivariate statistics to compare characteristics of
patients who uploaded any data vs. patients who did not. We then constructed a logistic
regression model using complete case analysis (Stata, College Station, TX). The analysis
received no explicit external funding. The CSHS Institutional Review Board approved this
analysis with a waiver of informed consent based on its use of de-identified data.

 Results
Of 79,953 registered portal users invited to sync devices over the 37 days of our study period,
we excluded: 8019 users without any portal logins during January 1, 2015–April 24, 2015; 513
users over 89 years old; 2809 users under 18 years old; and 2507 users with missing or clearly
erroneous data. Of 66,105 remaining users, 499 (0.8%) uploaded data during the first 37 days
of this initiative. Bivariate analysis showed that these early adopters were more likely than
non-adopters to be younger, male, and white, lower income, CSHS employees, and to have
higher body mass indices (BMI). Each aforementioned association except income was robust
to multivariable regression, which also showed early adopters were more likely to be insured
and non-Hispanic (Table 1). Neither Charlson comorbidity index nor CSHS utilization (as
measured by cost, hospitalizations, or outpatient encounters) predicted adoption.
Discussion
In this large-scale initiative inviting patient portal users to sync PFTs with an EHR, only 0.8%
of users uploaded data. This low uptake was likely related to the use of only one invitation via
patient portal. Indeed, greater uploading among organizational employees suggests that
greater awareness of the initiative would have induced more adoption. To be sure, this might
also reflect a better understanding of the potential utility of such data or greater confidence in
the ability of the institution to hold such data private. Nonetheless, the low adoption rate dem-
onstrates that there was not substantial intrinsic desire to share PFT data, such that marketing,
incentives, and/or cultural change may be needed to increase syncing. Although population-

 level data suggests that the majority of the patient portal user population likely had access to a
compatible device, [1] addressing users’ willingness and ability to sync devices would likely
increase data sharing.
Regarding health status, early adopters were younger and without greater comorbidity or
resource utilization, but had higher BMIs. If these higher BMIs were due to adipose tissue
stores rather than muscle mass, these higher BMIs may reflect greater potential for health ben-
efit among early adopters. However, our other results, except for the higher adoption rate
among males, suggest that those most at risk for poor health outcomes were least likely to
share PFT data with providers. A systematic review of patient portals also found decreased use
among racial and ethnic minorities.[9] However, it found that higher portal use was associated
with worse health status, which contrasts with our finding of less PFT data sharing among
those with worse health status.
The Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology could help to explain
such differences, in that hedonic motivation may be responsible for early adoption of PFT data
sharing among younger, healthier men.[4] In contrast, effort expectancy, facilitating condi-
tions, social influence, and/or performance expectancy may drive longer term use of patient
portals among sicker patients. If this is the case, we should expect to see increased sharing of
PFT data among sicker patients as this technology matures. Future research should test this
hypothesis by studying data sharing over a longer time period. Other improvements might
involve more active recruitment strategies, which could involve multiple communications and
specific information regarding the value of sharing PFT data with providers. Researchers
should also seek to understand patients’ reluctance to share PFT data, to increase such sharing,
and to measure its benefits, especially among those at risk for poor health outcomes.
