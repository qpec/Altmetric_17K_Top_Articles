Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common, irreversible blinding condition that leads to the
loss of central vision. AMD has a complex aetiology with both genetic as well as environmental risks
factors, and share many similarities with Alzheimer's disease. Recent findings have contributed signifi-
cantly to unravelling its genetic architecture that is yet to be matched by molecular insights. Studies are
made more challenging by observations that aged and AMD retinas accumulate the highly pathogenic
Alzheimer's-related Amyloid beta (Ab) group of peptides, for which there appears to be no clear genetic
basis. Analyses of human donor and animal eyes have identified retinal Ab aggregates in retinal ganglion
cells (RGC), the inner nuclear layer, photoreceptors as well as the retinal pigment epithelium. Ab is also a
major drusen constituent; found correlated with elevated drusen-load and age, with a propensity to
aggregate in retinas of advanced AMD. Despite this evidence, how such a potent driver of neuro-
degeneration might impair the neuroretina remains incompletely understood, and studies into this
important aspect of retinopathy remains limited. In order to address this we exploited R28 rat retinal
cells which due to its heterogeneous nature, offers diverse neuroretinal cell-types in which to study the
molecular pathology of Ab. R28 cells are also unaffected by problems associated with the commonly used
RGC-5 immortalised cell-line, thus providing a well-established model in which to study dynamic Ab
effects at single-cell resolution. Our findings show that R28 cells express key neuronal markers calbindin,
protein kinase C and the microtubule associated protein-2 (MAP-2) by confocal immunofluorescence
which has not been shown before, but also calretinin which has not been reported previously. For the
first time, we reveal that retinal neurons rapidly internalised Ab1-42, the most cytotoxic and aggregate-
prone amongst the Ab family. Furthermore, exposure to physiological amounts of Ab1-42 for 24 h
correlated with impairment to neuronal MAP-2, a cytoskeletal protein which regulates microtubule
dynamics in axons and dendrites. Disruption to MAP-2 was transient, and had recovered by 48 h,
although internalised Ab persisted as discrete puncta for as long as 72 h. To assess whether Ab could
realistically localise to living retinas to mediate such effects, we subretinally injected nanomolar levels of
oligomeric Ab1-42 into wildtype mice. Confocal microscopy revealed the presence of focal Ab deposits in
RGC, the inner nuclear and the outer plexiform layers 8 days later, recapitulating naturally-occurring
patterns of Ab aggregation in aged retinas. Our novel findings describe how retinal neurons inter-
nalise Ab to transiently impair MAP-2 in a hitherto unreported manner. MAP-2 dysfunction is reported in
AMD retinas, and is thought to be involved in remodelling and plasticity of post-mitotic neurons. Our

1. Introduction
Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common blinding
condition that leads to the irreversible loss of central vision
amongst the elderly (Khandhadia et al., 2012; Lotery, 2008). The
disease manifests from midlife onwards to affect over ½ million
individuals in the UK (source: Macular Society, UK), or approxi-
mately 50 million individuals globally (Gordois et al., 2012). The
current strategy of using anti-vascular growth factor (VEGF) in-
hibitors to treat the less common neovascular (nv) form is inade-
quate, as prolonged treatment appears to damage the remaining
retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) leading to the geographic atrophy
(GA) form of AMD (Grunwald et al., 2015; Lois et al., 2013). Whilst
this treatment has benefited many nvAMD patients by restoring
partial sight, its limited effect reveals the restrictions of a therapy
based on an incomplete understanding of this complex disease.
Moreover, it is almost impossible to maintain initial visual gains
seen with anti-VEGF therapy due to the need for indefinite treat-
ment in some patients (Hykin et al., 2016). The prognosis for GA
patients is considerably worse, as there is currently no treatment
(Khandhadia et al., 2012). Recent advances have contributed sub-
stantially to revealing the genetic basis of AMD (Fritsche et al., 2013,
2016). However, AMD, like other complex chronic degenerative
conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), cannot solely be
defined by genetics (Sanchez-Mut and Graff, 2015; Sato and
Morishita, 2013). For instance, factors such as an unhealthy life-
style, poor diet and obesity are all known to play considerable
roles in increasing the risks of sight loss (Chiu et al., 2014;
Khandhadia et al., 2012; Pikuleva and Curcio, 2014). To add to this
complexity, the Alzheimer's-associated Amyloid beta (Ab) group of
misfolding proteins were reported to accumulate in ageing retinas
(Ratnayaka et al., 2015). Such Ab deposits were found in retinal
whole-mounts associated with photoreceptor outer segments, the
RPE and Bruch's membrane (BrM), as well as in choroidal vessels
(Hoh et al., 2010; Koronyo-Hamaoui et al., 2011). Increased retinal
Ab loads were also correlated with advancing age and with high
levels of drusen (Anderson et al., 2004). Of note, Ab was reported to
be within drusen, organised into spheres referred to as amyloid
vesicles (Anderson et al., 2004; Johnson et al., 2002). Ultrastructural
and confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed these vesicles
to have a concentric ring-like interior permeated with Ab immu-
noreactivity (Anderson et al., 2004). Such vesicles also formed a
substantial proportion of drusen volume (Anderson et al., 2004;
Isas et al., 2010; Luibl et al., 2006). It appears that retinal Ab is
correlated with advanced forms of AMD (Anderson et al., 2004),
with one study reporting Ab-positive drusen only in patients with
AMD (Dutescu et al., 2009). Furthermore, well-established AMD
risk factors such as cholesterol and high-fat diets are also associated
with increased retinal Ab loads (Kauppinen et al., 2016; Khandhadia
et al., 2012; Ratnayaka et al., 2015). This pattern of Ab aggregation
suggests that the RPE, the focus of most AMD pathology, may be
particularly at risk from Ab. However, Ab also appears to accumu-
late in specific regions of the neuroretina. For example, Ab immu-
noreactivity was reported in retinal ganglion cells (RGC) of mice
(Guo et al., 2007) and in the inner nuclear layer and RGC of rabbits
(Dasari et al., 2011), whilst curcumin positive Ab plaques were
observed in retinal whole-mounts of AD patients (Koronyo-
Hamaoui et al., 2011). This was not surprising as some retinal
neurons express the amyloid precursor protein (APP) (Dutescu
et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011); the precursor form from which
Ab is cleaved (Benilova et al., 2012). Ab1-42, which is considered to
be the most pathogenic and aggregate-prone of the Ab species
(Citron et al., 1997), was shown to increase in RGC with increasing
age (Wang et al., 2011). This observation is consistent with evidence
that senescent RPE also produce increasing levels of Ab (Yoshida
et al., 2005). Despite such indications there is very little under-
standing of how Ab can actually affect retinal neurons. Key ques-
tions such as how Ab behaves in the retina and what its long-term
effect may be remains unanswered. Here, by utilizing the rat neu-
roretinal R28 cells (Seigel, 1996), we assessed how Ab might affect
the neuroretina at single-cell resolution. Our findings reveal for the
first time that oligomeric Ab1-42 is rapidly internalised by retinal
neurons. Furthermore, exposure to nanomolar (nM) quantities of
Ab resulted in the transient downregulation of microtubule asso-
ciated protein-2 (MAP-2). Our findings also show that retinal
neurons retained internalised Ab long after initial exposure. We
also show for the first time that subretinally injected Ab1-42 accu-
mulates in the neuroretina mimicking naturally-occurring patterns
of Ab deposition, and indicating that these have the potential to
realistically impair retinal MAP-2. Our findings provide new in-
sights into how Ab can target the neuroretina, contributing to
chronic degenerative conditions such as AMD.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Preparation and characterisation of Ab
Human recombinant lyophilized Ab1-42 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-
propanol (HFIP) was purchased from rPeptide (Bogart, GA, USA) for
use in experiments. Lyophilized product was solubilized to 1 mg/
mL in HFIP (Sigma, UK), vortexed for 1 min and sonicated for 5 min
in a 50 Hz FS100 Frequency Sweep (Decon, UK) bath sonicator to
ensure proper reconstitution of samples. Evaporation of HFIP was
performed using dry nitrogen and subsequent vacuum desiccation
of samples for 30 min to remove residual resuspension solvent. The
resultant Ab1-42 peptidic film was resuspended in DMSO (ACROS
Organics, US) to 1 mg/mL, vortexed and allowed to stand for 1 min
before being added to a 2 mL Zeba desalting column, equilibrated
with Ab buffer (10 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1.6 mM KCl, 2 mM
MgCl2$6H2O and 3.5 mM CaCl2$2H2O pH 7.4) to facilitate buffer
exchange. 40 mL of buffer was applied as a stack and the columns
spun at 1000 g for 2 min at 4 �C to collect eluates containing Ab1-42
peptide. Samples were subsequently spun at 16,000 g for 30 min in
a 4 �C-controlled centrifuge to pellet small amounts of unwanted
higher molecular weight aggregates, whilst the supernatant con-
taining monomeric Ab was harvested and incubated on ice for 1½ h
prior to use in experiments. Peptide concentrations were calculated
from the absorbance measured with a Nano drop ND-100 at
280 nm as well as the Ab molar co-extinction efficient of
1490 M�1 cm�1 using Beer Lamberts Law. Typical Ab yields were
between 70 and 120 mM, which correspond to Ab concentrations
reported by others (Broersen et al., 2011). A similar technique was
used to prepare Alexa Fluor® 647-tagged Ab1-42. In this case, Ab1-42
peptides in DMSO were pre-incubated with 20 ml of 1 M sodium
G. Taylor-Walker et al. / Experimental Eye Research 153 (2016) 110e121
111
 bicarbonate and 10 ml of 11.3 nm/ml dye in ddH2O for 15 min at room
temperature prior to loading into buffer exchange columns. Con-
centrations of Alexa Fluor® 647-tagged Ab1-42 preparations were
determined as before; accounting for the contribution of the dye to
absorbance readings at 280 nm, as per manufacturer's instructions
(Invitrogen, UK). Lo-bind Eppendorf tubes and tips were used
during experiments to achieve maximal harvest (Soura et al., 2012).
2.2. Cell culture
R28 cells (Seigel, 1996) (Kerafast Inc., MA, USA) were cultured as
described (Seigel, 2014) in a medium consisting of Dulbecco's
modified eagle's medium (ThermoFisher, UK), 10% foetal calf serum
(FCS) (Sigma, UK), 0.37% NaCO3, 0.058% L-glutamine and 100 mg/ml
gentamycin (Sigma-Aldrich, UK). Cells were maintained in a hu-
midified incubator at 37 �C and 5% CO2. Cultures were monitored
daily by phase-contrast light microscopy to ensure that cells were
maintained at sub-confluent levels. All experiments were carried
out between passages 6e22. For confocal immunofluorescence
experiments, cells were seeded on 100 mg/ml laminin (Sigma, UK)
coated coverslips at sub-confluent levels and experiments per-
formed within 2e5 days. Cultures were incubated with equal vol-
umes of either human oligomeric Ab1-42 (final concentration of Ab
in each well equated to 1000 nM) or vehicle. Coverslips were fixed
at 24, 48 and 72 h with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Sigma, UK) for
15 min at 4 �C.
2.3. Animals
All aspects of animal studies were carried out in accordance
with the U.K Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986. Further-
more, animal studies complied with ARRIVE guidelines, ethical
oversight of the host institution's Local Research Committee and
adhered to the statement for use of animals in ophthalmic and
vision research by the Association for Research in Vision and
Ophthalmology (ARVO). Male and female C57BL/6 mice were
sourced from the Biomedical Research Facility (University of
Southampton, UK), maintained on a standard 12 h light/dark cycle
and allowed access to water and food ad libitum. Animals aged
between 4 and 5 months were anaesthetised intraperitoneally with
ketamine (6 mg/ml) and dexmedetomidine (0.5 mg/ml). Pupils
were dilated with 1% tropicamide and 2.5% phenylephrine drops.
Mice were placed under a surgical microscope and subretinally
injected using a sharp 34 gauge needle with either 625 nM human
oligomeric Ab1-42 (n ¼ 10 eyes from 10 separate animals) or vehicle
(n ¼ 3 eyes from 3 separate animals) in a 2 ml volume. These
numbers exclude mice that developed occasional retinal bleeds
following subretinal injection. Animals were revived using 0.5 mg/
ml intraperitoneal anti-sedan. Soon after injections, funduscopic
images confirmed the presence of subretinal blebs. At 8 days post
injection, mice were anesthetised as before and the fundus imaged
prior to animals being killed.
2.4. Histological analysis
Mice were euthanized on day 8 following exposure to Ab1-42 or
vehicle. Eyes were enucleated within 5 min of euthanasia and were
immediately fixed in 4% PFA for 30 min at 4 �C, followed by washing
in 1� phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and dissection to remove the
anterior portion and lens. Samples were then processed through a
series of sucrose gradients to reduce water content via osmotic
potential before being embedded in optimal cutting temperature
formulation. Serial cryosections of samples at 16 mM intervals were
obtained using a Leica CM1850 UV microtome (Leica Microsystems,
UK) which were collected on superfrost® plus glass microscope
slides (Thermo Scientific, UK). Sections were then probed with the
appropriate set of primary and secondary antibodies.
2.5. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
Sub-confluent and confluent R28 cells fixed with 4% PFA on
coverslips were permeabilised and blocked with 1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-
Aldrich, UK) for 45 min at room temperature. Cultures were probed
with the following primary antibodies. Mouse anti-calretinin 6B8.2
(1:200, Millipore, UK), rabbit anti-PKC-a (1:500, Abcam, UK), rabbit
anti-b3-tubulin (1:200, Abcam, UK), rabbit anti-calbindin D-28K
(1:500, Millipore, UK), rabbit anti-MAP-2 (1:200, Abcam, UK) and
mouse monoclonal anti-human Ab 82E1 antibody (1:100; IBL,
Japan). Secondary antibodies were goat anti-mouse 488 or 594
(1:200, Invitrogen, UK), goat anti-rabbit 488 or 594 (1:200, Invi-
trogen, UK) and cytopainter phalloidin iFluor 647 (1:1000, Abcam,
UK). Direct visualisation of Ab was achieved via an Alexa Fluor®
647-tagged motif. Cryosectioned mouse retinal tissues on glass
coverslips were washed and coated in blocking serum (10% normal
goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature.
Tissues were probed overnight with rabbit anti-b3-tubulin (1:200,
Abcam, UK) and mouse monoclonal anti-human Ab 82E1 antibody
(1:100; IBL, Japan) followed by secondary antibodies goat anti-
rabbit 594 (1:200, Invitrogen, UK) and goat anti-mouse 488
(1:200, Invitrogen, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei
were counterstained with 1 mg/ml of 40,60-diamino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) in all cases. R28 cells on coverslips as well as mouse retinal
tissues were embedded in Moweol mounting medium with Citi-
fluor anti-fade between two glass coverslips. Images were acquired
using a Leica SP8 laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, UK). Dynamic information within confocal images
remained unaltered in subsequent image manipulations in Leica or
Photoshop software.
2.6. Transmission electron microscopy
Negative stain transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was
performed on Ab1-42 preparations to visualise their assembly. 5 ml
samples were applied to formvar/carbon coated 200 mesh copper
grids (Agar Scientific, UK) at 0,1,1½, 3, 24 and 48 h post preparation
for 5 s and blotted dry. 5 ml of negative stain comprising 3%
ammonium molybdate in 0.1 M ammonium acetate buffer (pH 7.0)
with 1 grain of sucrose/mL was subsequently applied to grids for
10 s and immediately blotted dry. Grids were allowed to air dry
prior to visualising samples on a Hitachi H7000 microscope
(Hitachi High Technology, Japan) fitted with a SIS Megaview III
plate camera (EMSIS, Germany). We also visualised Ab assembly
using immunogold labelling experiments. Here, 5 ml samples were
applied to grids for 5 min, rinsed in wash buffer (0.1 M phosphate
buffer with 1% BSA) and labelled with a mouse monoclonal 82E1
antibody (1:100; IBL, Japan) for 1 h at room temperature. Unbound
antibodies were removed by 3� rinses in wash buffer prior to in-
cubation with a goat anti-mouse immunogold-conjugated sec-
ondary antibody
(1:50; Elektron Technology, UK). Following
incubation, samples were rinsed an additional 3� in wash buffer
and once in distilled water before being blotted dry. All antibody
incubations were performed in 0.1 M PBS with 1% BSA at room
temperature. Negative stains of immunogold labelled grids were
performed as described earlier.
2.7. Statistical analysis
Statistical
analysis was performed using GraphPad
Prism
(GraphPad, USA). Data were subject to the unpaired student's t-test
G. Taylor-Walker et al. / Experimental Eye Research 153 (2016) 110e121
112
 to compare total fluorescence readouts from R28 cells treated with
1000 nM Ab1-42 (n ¼ 12) vs. cultures treated with vehicle only
(n ¼ 10) to assess whether Ab is capable of inducing alterations to
MAP-2. Data is shown as mean values ± standard error of the mean
(SEM) where a statistical significance of p � 0.05 is denoted by a
single asterisk.
3. Results
3.1. Establishing timelines for in-vitro extraction of oligomeric Ab
The dynamics of Ab aggregation follows a well-established
pattern of self-assembly, where monomers initially associate to
form dimer, trimers and oligomers before aggregating into proto-
fibrils and mature fibrils. Soluble oligomeric Ab is known to be the
most
pathogenic;
able
to
penetrate
biomimetic
membranes
compared to more complex Ab forms (Williams et al., 2010, 2011).
Using a well-established protocol of in-vitro Ab preparation
(Broersen et al., 2011; Soura et al., 2012), we identified a suitable
time point at which abundant Ab1-42 oligomers could be readily
isolated for our in-vitro and in-vivo experiments. Visualisation of
Ab preparations (80e110 mM) at different time points by negative
stain TEM revealed discrete structures corresponding to 15e65 nm
in diameter at 1 and 1½ h after preparation (Fig. 1A, C). At 3 h we
observed the emergence of protofibrils (Fig. 1E), whilst fibrils of
growing complexity with progressively heavier negative staining
appeared at 24 and 48 h (Fig. 1G, I). No structures were observed on
grids coated with vehicle (Fig. 1K). In order to confirm that these
structures were Ab, we used the 82E1 antibody that only recognises
the Ab N-terminus residues 1e16. Immunogold labelling coupled to
this antibody showed electron-dense gold particles on structures
corresponding to the size of oligomers between 1 and 1½ h (Fig. 1B,
D), as well as regular patterns of staining along more elaborate
protofibrils and mature fibrils at later time points (Fig. 1F, H, J).
However, even by 24 h, not all Ab had assembled into fibrils, indi-
cating a certain degree of heterogeneity amongst immunogold-
positive
structures
(Fig. 1H).
No immunogold
labelling
was
observed on grids probed with the secondary antibody only
(Fig. 1L). Based on this pattern and rate of Ab aggregation, oligo-
meric forms were observed to be most prevalent approximately
1½ h after preparation. We therefore harvested oligomeric Ab1-42 at
this critical time point for subsequent in-vitro and in-vivo studies.
3.2. R28 cells express important neuronal markers
In order to study dynamic Ab effects on neuroretinal cells at
single-cell resolution we utilized the rat R28 cell-line (Seigel, 1996).
The diverse natures of these cultures are comparable to the het-
erogeneous population of different neuronal cell-types in the
Fig. 1. The in-vitro aggregation dynamics of human Ab1-42. Transmission electron
micrographs showing aggregation of negatively stained and immunogold labelled
human Ab1-42 at 1, 1½, 3, 24 and 48 h. [A, C] Small amorphous aggregates including
oligomers are visible 1-1½ h after preparation, showing heavy negative staining
(yellow arrows) which were [B, D] confirmed to be Ab by the anti-Ab specific 82E1 and
immunogold labelling (red arrows). Ab continued to aggregate to form larger struc-
tures over time including protofibrils and mature fibrils that can be observed in [E, G
and I] negative stained sections (lighter negative stain surrounding larger structures)
and in corresponding [F, H and J] immunogold labelled images (patterns of electron-
dense gold particles surrounding fibrillar assemblies). Not all Ab aggregated, as some
remained as discrete structures or isolated immunogold-labelled puncta [E, F], indi-
cating a degree of heterogeneity at later time points. [K] Vehicle controls showed no
negative staining or [L] electron-dense particles after incubation with immunogold
secondary antibody only. Scale bars correspond to 200 nm. (For interpretation of the

 mammalian retina (Seigel, 2014; Seigel et al., 2004). R28 cells have
been shown to express key neuronal markers including calbindin,
protein kinase C (PKC) and MAP-2 by microarray, immunocyto-
chemistry and/or immunoblotting analysis (Bodur and Layer, 2011;
Seigel et al., 2004). As we wished to determine whether Ab could
impair neurons by disrupting these markers, we first confirmed
their expression by confocal-IF which has not been demonstrated
before. Our findings showed the expression of PKC-a (Fig. 2B), b3-
tubulin (Fig. 2C), calbindin (Fig. 2E), as well as the microtubule
associated protein-2 (MAP-2) (Fig. 2F). We also demonstrated that
these neurons expressed calretinin (Fig. 2C, D), which has not been
reported in R28 cells previously.
3.3. Ab is rapidly internalised by R28 neuroretinal cells
R28 cultures were treated with either 1000 nM of oligomeric
Ab1-42 or vehicle alone. Neurons were also incubated with Alexa
647-tagged Ab1-42. At 24 and 48 h after incubation, confocal-IF
microscopy revealed small, discrete signals corresponding to Ab
which were mainly intracellular in distribution (Fig. 3AeC, E).
Signals from such internalised Ab particles (untagged as well as
tagged Ab) were often quite dim in appearance, and were observed
predominantly in the perinuclear region of neurons. By contrast,
larger clusters of brighter fluorescent Ab particles, which were
evident by 48 h, appeared to be extracellular (Fig. 3D, F). This trend
to aggregate extracellularly continued, and by 72 h appeared as
highly visible, large, bright fluorescent clusters (Fig. 3G). A mixture
of Ab particles were therefore observed at 72 h (Fig. 3H); smaller
internalised Ab particles remained unchanged in size from earlier
time points, whilst larger Ab aggregates appeared to have formed
extracellularly (Fig. 3G, H). No signals were evident in vehicle
treated controls or cultures treated with the secondary antibody
only (Fig. 3I, J). Cultures treated with vehicle only in tagged Ab
experiments showed no signals (Fig. 3K); indicating absence of
non-specific binding. Importantly, by probing with the anti-82E1
antibody, we confirmed that fluorescent signals in Alexa 647-
tagged Ab1-42 treated cultures were specific for Ab, and that Ab
had not disassociated from its fluorescent motif (Fig. 3L). Ab ap-
pears not to have any discernible effects on the expression/distri-
bution of calbindin, PKC or calretinin in R28 neurons (data not
shown).
3.4. Ab transiently impairs the microtubule associated protein-2
(MAP-2)
The exposure of R28 cultures to physiological amounts of olig-
omeric Ab1-42 (1000 nM) resulted in the downregulation of
neuronal MAP-2 after 24 h (Fig. 4A, B). However, no such effects
were observed at 48 (Fig. 4C, D) or 72 h (Fig. 4E, F). Quantification of
MAP-2 revealed an approximately 33% reduction in total fluores-
cence intensity (arbitrary fluorescence units or AFU) compared to
vehicle treated cultures (Fig. 4G). However, MAP-2 fluorescence
levels in Ab treated neurons had recovered by 48 h, and appeared to
be stable afterwards (Fig. 4H, I). Although MAP-2 fluorescence was
transiently
impaired,
its
intracellular
pattern
of
distribution
remained unaffected (Fig. 4AeF).
3.5. Subretinally injected Ab localises to the neuroretina
Although APP/Ab immunoreactivity was previously reported in
whole retinal mounts, in RGC, the inner nuclear layer and on
photoreceptors (Dasari et al., 2011; Dutescu et al., 2009; Guo et al.,
Fig. 2. Confocal immunofluorescence confirms the expression of R28 neuronal markers. R28 cultures were probed with a variety of antibodies against specific neuronal markers and
then imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. [A] Brightfield image showing typical morphology of R28 neurons. [B] Expression of protein kinase Ca (red), [C] b3-

[CeF] correspond to 30 mm. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

 2007; Hoh et al., 2010; Kipfer-Kauer et al., 2010; Koronyo-Hamaoui
et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011), we wanted to establish whether a
predetermined amount of physiological Ab1-42 was realistically
capable of localising to the living retina. To assess if this was
possible, ~2 ml of oligomeric of Ab1-42 (625 nM) was subretinally
injected into C57BL/6 wildtype mice to recapitulate the elevated Ab
burden reported in aged and AMD retinas (Ratnayaka et al., 2015).
Tissues were analysed away from site of the injection to exclude the
possibility of erroneously studying retinal sections with any me-
chanically induced trauma. Importantly, subretinal injections via
the sclera ensured that the needle did not pass through the neu-
roretina which remained intact and undisturbed throughout the
procedure. In this way, we ensured that retinal Ab immunoreac-
tivity did not arise due to direct contact of the needle with the
retina. Use of the anti-Ab 82E1 antibody excluded the likelihood of
APP cross-reactivity, ensuring that signals were only due to the
presence of bona fide Ab deposits. Assessment of retinal cross
sections by confocal-immunofluorescence 8 days after injections
revealed distinct Ab deposits in areas corresponding to RGC, inner
nuclear and the outer plexiform layers (Fig. 5A, B). Optically
enhanced confocal sections showed magnified images of these Ab
aggregates,
which
appeared
as
distinct
fluorescence
signals
distributed in the perinuclear region of neurons (Fig. 5B insert). No
fluorescence signals from Ab were observed in vehicle injected eyes
(Fig. 5C).
4. Discussion
Several laboratories have demonstrated the presence of Ab ag-
gregates in aged and AMD retinas (Ratnayaka et al., 2015). These
studies using histological and confocal-immunofluorescence ap-
proaches in wildtype rodent, rabbit, as well as human donor eyes
showed Ab deposits predominantly in the outer retina, focused
around the RPE; specifically within drusen, in the RPE-BrM inter-
face and on photoreceptor outer segments (Anderson et al., 2004;
Hoh et al., 2010; Isas et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2002; Luibl et al.,
2006). One such study showed that nM amounts of oligomeric Ab
induced a pro-inflammatory environment by elevating interleukin-
8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in RPE, whilst driving cellular
senescence and damaging the RPE barrier function (Cao et al.,
2013). Similar findings by other groups revealed that Ab also acti-
vated the complement system to bring about a state of chronic
inflammation in subretinal tissues (Catchpole et al., 2013; Koyama
et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008, 2012b; Yoshida et al., 2005). How-
ever, retinal neurons are also immunopositive for APP/Ab (Dasari
et al., 2011; Dutescu et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2007; Hoh et al.,
2010; Kipfer-Kauer et al., 2010; Koronyo-Hamaoui et al., 2011;
Wang et al., 2011), suggesting that Ab activity is not exclusive to the
RPE. Therefore, to fully understand how Ab could impair the se-
nescent eye, it was important to study whether the neuroretina is
also affected by this neurotoxic group of peptides. We therefore set

 out to address this important question which has thus far garnered
only limited attention.
Recent insights into Ab-mediated pathogenicity showed that
oligomeric rather than fibrillar Ab to be the most toxic and closely
associated with AD neuropathology (Benilova et al., 2012; McLean
et al., 1999). Although both oligomeric and fibrillar Ab have been
reported surrounding the RPE (Isas et al., 2010; Luibl et al., 2006;
Ratnayaka et al., 2015), there is a scarcity of such details with
respect to Ab deposits in the neuroretina itself. Here, we sought to
determine the effects of oligomeric Ab in the retina due to its strong
associations with neuronal dysfunction. With regards to Ab species,
both Ab1-40 and Ab1-42 are likely to be present in the retina, as their
soluble forms were reported in pico-nano molar range concentra-
tions in bovine vitreous (Prakasam et al., 2010). Our studies focused
on oligomeric Ab1-42; as this highly neurotoxic and aggregate-
prone Ab species has been the focus of considerable work in neu-
rodegeneration (Benilova et al., 2012; Soura et al., 2012). As neurons
in the central nervous system are known to secrete small soluble Ab
forms (Benilova et al., 2012; McLean et al., 1999), we reasoned that
this was also likely to be the case in the retina, particularly as some
retinal neurons are immunopositive for APP/Ab (Dasari et al., 2011;
Dutescu et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2007; Koronyo-Hamaoui et al.,
2011; Wang et al., 2011). The use of antibodies that cannot distin-
guish between APP vs. Ab in past studies (Dasari et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2011) have resulted in some confusion. Nonetheless, APP/Ab
immunoreactivity is likely to correspond to discrete Ab deposits, at
least in some instances (Guo et al., 2007; Kipfer-Kauer et al., 2010;
Koronyo-Hamaoui et al., 2011). Given the long term nature of such
Ab deposits, these are probably fibrillar in nature (Benilova et al.,
2012; Williams et al., 2010). A dynamic equilibrium is thought to
exist between fibrillar Ab deposits and toxic Ab oligomers, creating
a local spillover of neurotoxic Ab species in surrounding tissues
(Benilova et al., 2012). Hence, retinal Ab deposits may act as a
persistent reservoir for toxic Ab forms such as oligomers. Neurons
of the retina are therefore likely to be exposed to soluble oligomeric
Ab from several sources. Consequently, our experiments sought to
recapitulate conditions where neuroretinal cells were exposed to at
least one Ab conformation (oligomeric), species (Ab1-42) and
physiological amounts (nM concentrations) that the living retina
might realistically be exposed to over decades. As it was important
to use oligomeric Ab, we first investigated the aggregation dy-
namics of Ab1-42 in our preparations to determine when they were
most prevalent. Our negative stain TEM and immunogold labelling
experiments consistently showed discrete particles ranging be-
tween 15 nm and 65 nm in diameter, which corresponded to the
reported size of Ab oligomers (Williams et al., 2010). These were
abundantly visible at ~1½ h after preparation; the time point at
which they were harvested for use in our experiments.
Fig. 5. Experimentally introduced Ab deposit as discrete focal aggregates in the neuroretina. In order to assess whether physiological amounts of Ab can deposit in living retinas,
C57BL/6 mice were subretinally injected with 625 nM of human Ab1-42 or vehicle control. Retinal cross-sections were examined blindly in at least 3 separate animals (n ¼ 10 Ab
injected eyes, and n ¼ 3 vehicle control eyes) by confocal-immunofluorescence after 8 days. Representative images from at least 20 confocal z-stacks consistently show [A-B] Ab
deposits in RGC, inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers (arrows) as visualised by anti-Ab 82E1 coupled to a secondary fluorescence antibody (green). b3-tubulin and nuclear DPAI
appear red and blue, respectively. [B] The red channel (b3-tubulin staining) was removed to highlight focal Ab deposits (green) within an enlarged section (yellow box), which
shows a detailed image of retinal Ab aggregates (arrows). Scale bars in A, B corresponds to 50 mm, whilst the scale bar in magnified insert is 20 mm [C] Eyes injected with vehicle only
lacked Ab immunoreactivity. b3-tubulin and nuclear DPAI appear red and blue, respectively. The scale bar corresponds to 50 mm. (For interpretation of the references to colour in

diminished in Ab treated cultures compared to controls. This appeared to be transient as no obvious effects were observed between Ab vs. vehicle treated cultures at [C, D] 48 h and
[E-F] 72 h. Scale bars correspond to 30 mm. MAP-2 fluorescence intensity (green) was quantified blindly in images taken randomly across different time points in at least 3 separate
experiments. [G] 24 h after Ab exposure, average fluorescence values in maximal intensity projections were 15.9, SEM ± 2.1 (n ¼ 6) vs. 23.9, SEM ± 1.29 (n ¼ 4) in vehicle treated
cultures. [H] Similar measurements taken 48 h after cells were treated with Ab were 29.7, SEM ± 1.8 (n ¼ 3) vs. 28.0, SEM ± 1.4 (n ¼ 3) in vehicle only cultures, and [I] after 72 h 24.8,
SEM ± 3.4 (n ¼ 3) in Ab treated vs. 24.9, SEM ± 0.9 (n ¼ 3) in vehicle treated cultures. Error bars represents the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical significance (p < 0.05
denoted by *) was evident only at 24 h. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

 There is considerable debate as to how Ab might mediate its
pathogenicity.
Several
models
have
been
proposed
include
carpeting, pore-forming and detergent-like mechanisms by which
membrane-damage may occur (Williams and Serpell, 2011). In the
current study, we observed that retinal neurons internalised Ab as
early as 24 h after exposure. Our previous work in SH-SY5Y neurons
and in cultured hippocampal cells showed that Ab was internalised
via clathrin-positive membrane invaginations (Soura et al., 2012).
These findings were consistent with observations that clathrin-
mediated mechanisms may at least be partly involved in Ab inter-
nalisation (Song et al., 2011; Wu and Yao, 2009). Although we did
not test internalisation mechanisms per se, similar processes may
also be involved in the retina. We assessed the capacity of Ab to
enter R28 neurons by two approaches; by using a secondary anti-
body to probe for untagged Ab, and by directly tagging Ab with a
fluorescent Alexa Fluor moiety. We reasoned that the former
approach was least likely to interfere with conformational ar-
rangements and thus preserve the ‘endogenous’ nature of Ab
oligomers. Nonetheless, both methods consistently demonstrated
that Ab had entered neurons by 24 h. Although we exposed neurons
to oligomeric Ab, once in culture, further experimental manipula-
tion became more difficult. For instance, we cannot regulate the
rate of aggregation or the manner in which Ab may subsequently
behave. However, Ab assembly is known to be influenced by local
conditions such as temperature, the presence of reactive oxygen
species, metals, cholesterol as well as nearby Ab deposits (Al-Hilaly
et al., 2013; Benilova et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2012a; Williams et al.,
2010). Such parameters are likely to impact on how and where Ab
may aggregate in susceptible retinas. We reasoned that Ab particles
that successfully entered neurons were likely to be oligomeric in
nature as these are known to be highly penetrative (Benilova et al.,
2012; Williams et al., 2011). We observed that the relative size of
such internalised Ab particles did not alter and remained consis-
tently stable for at least 72 h. In contrast, a proportion of oligomers
seemed to have undergone further assembly; appearing as large
fluorescent clusters on cell surfaces. These appear to be extracel-
lular; their larger size and apparent inability to enter neurons
suggesting that they were perhaps no longer oligomeric. An
observation consistent with a report that fibrillar Ab, compared to
oligomers, are less liable to enter through membranes (Williams
et al., 2010). Insightful as our findings are, these experiments
were carried out in R28 neurons, and we cannot rule out the pos-
sibility that primary neuroretinal cells may internalise Ab at
different rates. For example, RPE cell-lines and primary RPE cells
phagocytose photoreceptor outer segments at different rates
(Mazzoni et al., 2014). Genetically and phenotypically however,
R28 cells are highly suitable for these studies, as they display the
diversity of different neuronal types in the living retina (Seigel,
2014; Seigel et al., 2004). Moreover, these cells do not suffer from
problems associated with the widely utilized RGC-5 immortalised
cell-line; which was once thought to be a rat retinal ganglion cell-
line (Krishnamoorthy et al., 2001) but was recently demonstrated
to
be
a
transformed
mouse
photoreceptor
cell-line
instead
(Krishnamoorthy et al., 2013). This has led to those using the RGC-5
cell-line urging fellow researchers to first establish the expression
of specific retinal markers before considering their use as ‘retinal
ganglion-like cells’ (Sippl and Tamm, 2014; Van Bergen et al., 2009).
Prior to studying possible Ab effects, we also demonstrated for the
first time that R28 neurons express calbindin, PKC-a and MAP-2 by
high-resolution confocal microscopy. This confirms their presence
reported earlier by microarray, immunocytochemistry and/or
immunoblotting approaches (Bodur and Layer, 2011; Seigel et al.,
2004). We also showed for the first time that R28 cells express
calretinin; a neuronal Ca2þ-binding protein involved in calcium
signalling.
We found that exposure to nM quantities of oligomeric Ab for
24 h had downregulated MAP-2. The extent of this impairment was
considerable, corresponding to ~33% loss of MAP-2 fluorescence
intensity compared to controls. Previous studies of MAP-2 have also
used immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry quantifica-
tion to gain insights into its behaviour (Kharlamov et al., 2009;
Lingwood et al., 2008; Yan et al., 2010). Without further studies,
we are unable to comment on potential mechanisms that underlie
transient MAP-2 impairment. However, insights may be found in
studying interactions between the AD-associated tau protein,
which share homology with MAP-2 (Dehmelt and Halpain, 2005),
and Ab (Do et al., 2014). MAP-2 is typically expressed in axons and
dendrites of neurons. MAP-2 expression has been reported in
anuran (Gabriel et al., 1992), avian (Tucker et al., 1988) and
mammalian retinas (Okabe et al., 1989; Tucker and Matus, 1988);
specifically in RGC (Okabe et al., 1989; Smith et al., 2008), amacrine
cells (Gabriel et al., 1992) as well as in cell bodies and inner seg-
ments of photoreceptors (Tucker and Matus, 1988). MAP-2 binds
tubulin via multiple domains at its C-terminus to promote the
polymerisation of microtubules, whilst its N-terminus contains a
projection domain exerting a long-range repulsive action (Dehmelt
and Halpain, 2005). MAP-2 upregulation is strongly correlated with
stabilising dendrites and is required for activity-dependent stabi-
lisation of new dendritic arbours (Vaillant et al., 2002). Further-
more, MAP-2 is critical to maintaining the spacing between
microtubules (Harada et al., 2002; Teng et al., 2001), and protects
dendritic microtubules from microtubule-severing enzymes such
as katanin that could otherwise destabilise dendrites (Sudo and
Baas, 2010). Although MAP-2 activities have not been extensively
investigated in the eye, it is likely to carryout similar functions in
the retina. MAP-2 is expressed by R28 neurons (Seigel et al., 2004),
while MAP-2 immunoreactivity is reported to be a reliable and
quantifiable marker of early neuronal injury (Lingwood et al.,
2008). Our studies showed that 48 h after Ab exposure, there
were no longer any differences between treated and control cul-
tures, suggesting that either Ab was unable to disrupt MAP-2
beyond 24 h and/or that adaptive responses to chronic Ab expo-
sure had restored MAP-2 by then. Such apparently transient Ab
effects have also been reported by others (Benilova et al., 2012; Dal
Pra et al., 2011). We also observed that Ab-mediated damage was
specific to MAP-2, as there were no discernible effects on retinal
calbindin, PKC or calretinin.
Use of in-vitro neuroretinal cultures was critical in obtaining
single-cell readouts via high-resolution imaging, which would not
have been possible in whole in-situ retinas. Direct experiments of
this nature in living retinas would also pose considerable problems
to studying dynamic aspects of Ab-mediated pathogenicity. Similar
issues confront studies into the AD brain, which has resulted in
researchers exploiting numerous cell culture models to address
fundamental questions. Indeed, we have previously used cultured
neurons to demonstrate that dynamic activities of actin underpin
extrasynaptic vesicle recycling in the hippocampus (Ratnayaka
et al., 2011). An important question that still remained to be clari-
fied was; how likely is Ab to impair MAP-2 in the living retina?
Previous studies have indicated neurons in the RGC and the inner
retina to be immunopositive for Ab (Dutescu et al., 2009; Guo et al.,
2007; Kipfer-Kauer et al., 2010). However, several of these studies
utilized antibodies that do not necessarily distinguish between Ab
and APP (Dasari et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2011). In order to assess if
such an outcome might be realistic, we subretinally injected olig-
omeric Ab1-42 in nM amounts into wildtype C57BL/6 mice; in
proximity to where Ab synthesis/deposition is reported to be most
prevalent (Anderson et al., 2004; Hoh et al., 2010; Isas et al., 2010;
Johnson et al., 2002; Luibl et al., 2006). When retinas were analysed
after 8 days, distinct areas corresponding to focal Ab deposits were

 observed in the RGC, the inner nuclear and outer plexiform layers in
addition to subretinal Ab aggregates. The accumulation of Ab
within these retinal layers supported the realistic possibility that
MAP-2 activity in axons/dendrites of RGC, bipolar, horizontal and
photoreceptors may be targeted by Ab. Use of the anti-Ab 82E1
antibody precluded the possibility of APP cross-reactivity, and
demonstrated for the first time that Ab was indeed capable of
accumulating in living retinas after chronic exposure; thus reca-
pitulating the pattern of Ab deposition reported in native tissues
(Dasari et al., 2011; Dutescu et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2007; Hoh et al.,
2010; Kipfer-Kauer et al., 2010; Koronyo-Hamaoui et al., 2011;
Wang et al., 2011). Immuno-surveillance by migratory retinal
microglia/microphages have been shown to engulf retinal Ab (Hoh
et al., 2010). Although we did not specifically probe for microglia/
macrophages, the pattern of Ab deposition observed excludes the
likelihood that they originated from such migratory scavengers
which display a distinct starburst morphology (Hoh et al., 2010;
Walsh et al., 2005). Once introduced subretinally into the living
retina, we were also unable to distinguish between oligomeric and
fibrillar Ab. However, based on our understanding of how Ab be-
haves in-vitro, under culture conditions and in other studies
(Benilova et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2010), we speculate that a
majority of oligomeric Ab1-42 had formed in-situ fibrillar retinal
deposits. This does not preclude the possibility that some oligomers
persisted, as we detected the presence of smaller Ab forms in-vitro
and in cultures at later time points, consistent with the possibility
that toxic oligomers could exist in equilibrium around fibrillar Ab
deposits (Benilova et al., 2012).
Although MAP-2 dysregulation had been implicated in AMD
retinas, until now there were no insights into how this could occur.
For instance, an association of MAP-2 variants were reported in
patients with advanced AMD (Zhang et al., 2008), whilst analysis of
donor GA AMD retinas revealed MAP-2 labelling in the inner seg-
ments of abnormal photoreceptors with neurite sprouts, tortuous
axons and abnormally located nuclei (Pow and Sullivan, 2007).
However, not all such abnormal neurons were MAP-2 positive.
Hence, the authors speculate that MAP-2 expression may be tran-
sient and expressed only during neuro-morphogenesis (Pow and
Sullivan, 2007) that occurs in post-mitotic neurons (Grandel et al.,
2006; Reye et al., 2002; Rich et al., 1997). If Ab is capable of tran-
siently impairing MAP-2, it may hinder the processes of neuronal
plasticity reported in AMD retinas (Sullivan et al., 2007). Our future
studies will assess if transient MAP-2 impairment can be visualised
or ‘captured’ in-vivo by culling mice at earlier time points. In this
way we will be able to draw direct comparisons between in-vitro
and in-vivo Ab effects. Similar Ab effects on other cytoskeletal
components including actin may affect extrasynaptic signalling
that also underpins neuronal plasticity (Ratnayaka et al., 2011).
These subtle mechanisms may not only contribute to chronic
retinal damage, but may also help explain different AMD pheno-
types, for instance when primary photoreceptor pathology is
observed without apparent damage to the underlying RPE (Bird
et al., 2014). Such a possibility is supported by studies showing
that Ab is capable of inducing a variety of retinal pathophysiologies,
for instance when intravitreal Ab injections in rodents resulted in
retinal inflammation (Howlett et al., 2011; Walsh et al., 2005) - a
well-documented feature in AMD retinas (Kauppinen et al., 2016;
Khandhadia et al., 2012). The therapeutic benefits of reducing
retinal Ab was highlighted in an elegant study where visual ab-
normalities in a human ApoE4 knock-in mouse that was aged and
fed a high fat diet were abolished by anti-Ab immunotherapy (Ding
et al., 2011). Furthermore, reducing Ab formation, clearance of Ab
deposition as well as inhibiting Ab aggregation in a mouse study of
experimentally-induced glaucoma not only revealed the role of Ab
in other retinal disorders, but also highlighted the therapeutic
benefits of inhibiting its retinal activities (Guo et al., 2007). Our
findings show how Ab is rapidly internalised to accumulate within
retinal neurons, whilst a proportion of extracellular Ab appear to
assemble, perhaps forming focal Ab deposits observed in aged/
AMD retinas. Specific Ab-mediated damage to MAP-2 in cultured
neurons as well as Ab deposition in living retinas suggests that it
has the capacity to impair neuronal modelling and plasticity.
Related questions such whether other Ab species may be involved,
what effects longer Ab exposures may produce, and what other
cytoskeletal elements may be targeted remains the subject of
further studies in our laboratory.
