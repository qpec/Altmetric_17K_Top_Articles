The inheritance of the centrosome during human fertilization remains mysterious. Here we
show that the sperm centrosome contains, in addition to the known typical barrel-shaped
centriole (the proximal centriole, PC), a surrounding matrix (pericentriolar material, PCM),
and an atypical centriole (distal centriole, DC) composed of splayed microtubules sur-
rounding previously undescribed rods of centriole luminal proteins. The sperm centrosome is
remodeled by both reduction and enrichment of specific proteins and the formation of these
rods during spermatogenesis. In vivo and in vitro investigations show that the flagellum-
attached, atypical DC is capable of recruiting PCM, forming a daughter centriole, and loca-
lizing to the spindle pole during mitosis. Altogether, we show that the DC is compositionally
and structurally remodeled into an atypical centriole, which functions as the zygote’s second
centriole. These findings now provide novel avenues for diagnostics and therapeutic strate-
gies for male infertility, and insights into early embryo developmental defects.

uman development begins with the zygote, which divides
many times to produce all of the somatic cells. These
somatic cells each contain two centrioles, which duplicate
in a number-controlled manner from pre-existing centrioles.
Since cells require two centrioles for normal division, one would
expect the human zygote to have two centrioles during interphase
and four centrioles during mitosis. However, four centrioles have
never been shown in any mammalian zygotes; only three cen-
trioles were observed1,;2. Since the human oocyte lacks centrioles,
and the zygote’s paternal pronucleus is associated with an aster of
microtubules, it seems that the embryo’s centrioles are paternally
inherited3,4. The paternal centrioles reside at the junction of the
sperm nucleus and flagellum, in a region known as the neck. The
neck region includes, in addition to the centrioles, the striated
columns, and capitulum, which surround an electron-light region
known as the vault5,6.
The current dogma is that the early sperm’s centrioles
and their surrounding pericentriolar material (PCM) are
modified by a process called centrosome reduction during
spermiogenesis5,7. During reduction, the distal centriole’s (DC)
typical structure disintegrates, the proteins surrounding the
centrioles that make up the PCM are eliminated, and a vault
appears in the expected place of the DC8. Only residual
microtubules and proteins are observed in the mature sper-
matozoa DC, and no function has been associated with the DC
remnants or the vault6 (Fig. 1a). Therefore, the current pre-
vailing dogma is that the sperm has a single functional cen-
triole, the PC9–13, and therefore the zygote inherits only one
centriole. Yet, the zygotic somehow provides four centrioles,
two for each daughter cell. The inheritance of only a single
centriole is problematic since centrioles form by duplication of
pre-existing centrioles, which act as a platform for the forma-
tion of a single nascent daughter centriole. If the zygote inherits
only one functional centriole, then the origin of the second
interphase centriole is unknown.
A similar enigma existed previously in insects until it was
shown that insect sperm possesses, in addition to the known
centriole, a second atypical centriolar structure14–16. This atypical
structure has been shown to be essential for normal fertility and
embryo development15,17. The presence of an unexpected second
centriolar structure in insects raises the possibility that humans
possess a similar atypical structure that may be important during
reproduction and development. Here we investigated human
spermatozoa and bovine zygotes to determine if mammals have a
functional atypical second centriole.
In this work, we examine several groups of centrosomal
proteins, and find that a subset of them are present, unex-
pectedly in the DC of human spermatozoa. Using Correlative
Light and Electron Microscopy as well as High Pressure
Freezing, Freeze Substitution Electron Microscopy, we find that
the DC is attached to the base of the axoneme, but that its
microtubules splay outward, forming a novel, atypical, struc-
ture. Using Super-Resolution microscopy we find that the
human and bovine DC’s subset of centriolar proteins are
organized into rods. During spermatogenesis in bovine testes,
we find that the DC’s rods appear during spermatid develop-
ment. Next, we test the competency of the DC using an in vitro
system and find that the human DC can recruit the PCM
protein, γ-tubulin. Furthermore, we follow the DC of bovine
sperm into the zygote and found that it recruits PCM, forms an
aster, forms a new daughter centriole, and localizes to the
spindle pole, all while maintaining its attachment to the axo-
neme. These findings discover a novel, atypical centriole in the
sperm, which functions in the zygote.
Results
The DC contains a subset of centriolar proteins. The dogma of
centrosome reduction and previously published literature states
that PCM proteins are reduced based on the observations that γ-
tubulin and PCNT are missing from the sperm centrosome5.
Likewise, we found that the PCM proteins γ-tubulin and PCNT
were eliminated from the neck region during spermatogenesis
(Supplementary Fig. 1a). Only one protein thus far has been seen
in the DC, CETN1/2; however, CETN1/2 was seen primarily in
the PC, and only inconsistently in the DC, which was interpreted
to be undergoing reduction5,6.
Contrary to this observation, we found that an antibody against
the centriolar protein CETN1/2 equally labeled both the DC and
PC in ejaculated human sperm (Supplementary Fig. 1a)5. Because
of this unexpected observation of CETN1/2 in the DC, we sought
to define the composition of the DC to determine whether it
could be the second centriole of the spermatozoa. We identified
candidate sperm centrosome proteins by comparing the sperma-
tozoon proteome18–21 to the centrosome database22 (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 1). We examined the localization
of candidates using immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 1).
Then, we validated the specificity of the antibodies in U2OS cells
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
The putative centrosomal proteins were separated into five
groups based on their localization in the spermatozoan neck
region (Fig. 1b). Consistent with centrosome reduction, we found
that several PCM/appendage/satellite proteins such as CEP152
and CEP192 were absent from the neck (Group i) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1b), and similarly some centriolar proteins such as
CEP135 and CEP76 were seen only to associate with the intact PC
(Group ii) (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Both of these groups support
the idea that the some proteins are exclusively present in the PC
and missing from the PCM the DC.
However, contrary to centrosome reduction, we observed
several
PCM/appendage
proteins,
such
as
CEP164
and
CDK5RAP2, in the capitulum and striated columns (Group iii)
(Supplementary Fig. 1d). These findings support structural
studies showing that the capitulum and striated columns form
in association with centriole microtubules, suggesting that the
neck structures are a specialized form of PCM8. Also, contrary to
centrosome reduction, we found some centriolar proteins such as
CEP295 and CNTROB were absent from the PC and were either
observed in the PCM or were undetectable, suggesting that the
composition of the PC is also altered during centrosome
reduction (Group iv) (Supplementary Fig. 1e).
Finally, several centriolar proteins labeled the DC (Group v).
Of these proteins, we found that centriole distal lumen proteins
CETN1/2 and POC523 localized equally to both the DC and PC
(Fig. 1c). The PCM protein CEP63 and the centriole/PCM
protein CPAP localized at the PC and DC (Fig. 1d). The
transition zone protein, CEP29024, localized to the junction
between the DC and the axoneme, presumably marking the tip of
the DC (Fig. 1e). Interestingly, we found that a centriolar protein,
POC1B, which is enriched in the atypical centriole of Drosophila
sperm15, was similarly enriched in the DC relative to the PC.
Three distinct antibodies confirmed that POC1B was enriched
about two-fold in the DC in comparison to the PC (Fig. 1f).
Altogether, these observations suggest that the DC is not
eliminated during spermatogenesis but, instead, is present with
an altered composition.
The DC is made of splayed microtubules. The POC1B enrich-
ment of the DC was unexpected, and therefore we investigated
the POC1B localization more precisely, using Correlative Light

Fig. 1 Centriolar proteins localize to the DC (group v). a The current dogma is that mature sperm have one centriole. The spermatid neck has a PC and DC,
and the ejaculated spermatozoon has a PC and an empty space, the vault, which marks the location of the degenerated DC (Manandhar et al.6). b
Graphical summary of the groups of the localization patterns of proteins in the sperm. Group i is centriolar proteins that were localized to the PC area only
and is consistent with the dogma. Group ii is PCM proteins that were absent from the sperm, as is consistent with the dogma. Group iii are PCM proteins
that were unexpectedly localized to the striated columns or capitulum. Group iv are centriolar proteins that were unexpectedly localized to the striated
columns or capitulum, or were unexpectedly absent altogether. Group v are proteins that were unexpectedly present in the DC and the PC, which are
inconsistent with the dogma. Group v is shown in c–f. c Antibodies against the centriole tip proteins CETN1/2 and POC5 labeled the PC and DC. d
Antibodies against CEP63 and CPAP labeled near the CETN1/2 or POC5-labeled PC and DC. e Antibodies against CEP290 labeled adjacent to the CETN1/
2-labeled DC, presumably marking the junction of the DC with the axoneme. f Three distinct antibodies against POC1B labeled both the PC and DC. Unlike
other centriolar proteins, POC1B was enriched in the DC relative to the PC (POC1B-P: 2.1 ± 0.5, POC1B-537: 2.74 ± 1.64, POC1B-5G5A7: 1.92 ± 0.41, N > 6).

 and Electron Microscopy. We found POC1B in the PC as well as
at the base of the axoneme, which we interpret to be the DC
(Fig. 2a). The DC is located between the vault and the axoneme,
flanked by the outer dense fibers and the striated columns. This
suggests that the DC is at the base of the axoneme, and the vault
is located between the two centrioles.
To precisely identify the location of the DC’s microtubules, we
studied tubulin and POC1B, using four anti-tubulin antibodies
(anti-β-tubulin E7, anti-α-tubulin DM1A, anti-acetylated-tubulin,
and sheep anti-tubulin). Each of the four anti-tubulin antibodies
labeled two foci. Both of these foci colocalized with POC1B in the
PC and the DC (Fig. 2b). In some cases, the tubulin signals in the

 PC and DC were more intense than in the midpiece axoneme,
possibly because the PC and DC microtubules were unmasked
during centrosome reduction. These findings suggest that the DC
microtubules were not degenerated as was previously believed.
To determine the location of the DC’s microtubules, we used
transmission
electron
microscopy (TEM)
with high-pressure
freezing-freeze substitution, which better preserves cellular struc-
tural integrity when compared to chemical fixation. We found that
the DC microtubules splayed out from the axoneme, surrounding
the vault, and extended up to the PC (Fig. 2c, d). The splayed
microtubules extend from the cylindrical axoneme and open up
forming an inverted cone that ends with an ovoid base facing the
nucleus (Fig. 2e). The presence of these microtubules may have
been overlooked previously because they were not in the typical
nine-fold symmetric pattern (Fig. 2f) and they may have been
disrupted by the classical chemical fixation methods used for TEM.
Structurally atypical centrioles have been observed previously in
insect sperm and are known as the proximal centriole-like
Fig. 2 POC1B associates with splayed microtubules at the axoneme base. a The PC and the DC were labeled with POC1B using Correlative Light and
Electron Microscopy. These structures were found to be associated with the splayed microtubules (arrowheads, between the axoneme and electron light
vault). Scale bars 200 nm. b Four distinct antibodies against tubulins labeled the DC and the PC with greater intensity than in the axoneme. Scale bars 1 μm.

numbered 1–9). During spermatogenesis, CEP152 and CENT1/2 localizes to 2–4 foci in spermatogonia (cells 1–3). In spermatocytes, CEP152 is maintained,
often in large foci surrounding much smaller CENT1/2 lines (cell 4). In round spermatids, CEP152 is localized to the ends of elongated CENT1/2 foci and
reduces into two small foci straddling the CENT1/2 line (cells 5–6). Finally, in the elongated spermatids (cells 7–9), CEP152 is localized to the tips of the
CENT1/2 “V” shape, before it is finally dramatically reduced. Scale bar 10 μm in low-magnification images (left), and 1 μm in centriole high-magnification

 structures (PCL)15,17,25–27. However, the atypical DC is distinct
from that of the PCL in fly (Fig. 2g) or beetle (Fig. 2h), suggesting
that sperm centrioles evolve diverse structures.
The DC proteins are organized into rods. To precisely localize
the
DC
proteins,
we
performed
sub-diffraction
resolution
microscopy. We found that CEP63, which normally forms a ring
around the centriole, localized as two dots, and CPAP, which is
commonly found in the centriole, localized around the DC
(Supplementary Fig. 4a–b). Importantly, POC1B, CETN1/2, and
POC5 exhibited rod-like distribution in various orientations
(Supplementary Fig. 4c). We identified six types of orientations.
The first, most common, was “V” shaped, where the rods were
angled away from each other. The second was “Reduced” orien-
tation, when one or both rods had a reduced size, appearing as a
single rod, a rod and a dot, a dot, or no signal at all. Third was
“Parallel”, where the rods were parallel. The fourth orientation we
found was “Wide”, where presumably, the rods were close to each
other. Fifth was “Staggered”, where the rods were in various
orientations. And finally, the sixth orientation was “Ring”, where
the rods appeared to be connected by thin lines (Fig. 3a). Four of
these categories included rods in different orientations (“V”,
“Parallel”, “Wide”, and “Staggered”), but the two others cannot be
explained as a different view of the same configuration, suggesting
that the relative position between the rods may be varied. How-
ever, in 40% of spermatozoa imaged, the rods appeared in a “V”
shape suggesting this may be the preferred orientation (Fig. 3b, c).
A similar “V” shape was also observed in STED (Supplementary
Fig. 4d).
The length of the individual rods in the “V” is about 190 nm,
which is about half the length of the distal lumen of a typical
centriole (~350 nm)28,29 (Fig. 3d). The width of the “V” tip
opening is about 230 nm, which is much wider than a typical
centriole lumen (~130 nm)28. The “V” was in line with the
axoneme and was flanked by the splayed-out DC microtubules
(Fig. 3e, f). This suggests that the rods associate with the splayed
microtubules of the DC.
Further examination of our electron microscopy images finds
electron-dense material along the splaying DC microtubules that
might be the structure underlying the rods (Supplementary
Fig. 5). Similarly, Manandhar et al.5 found using immunogold
labeling that CETN1/2 associates with microtubules at the point
where the microtubules begin to splay in the DC, the same site
where we observed the DC rods. This rod organization has never
been described for any centriolar protein; most centriolar proteins
and the structures within the distal lumen of a centriole exhibit
radial symmetry in the form of disk and column structures30–33.
Together, these findings demonstrate that several centrosomal
proteins have an atypical distribution in the DC (Fig. 3g).
Bovine DC undergo remodeling. To further study centrosome
remodeling and DC function during sperm development, we
examined bovine testes because bovine sperm, like human sperm,
was thought to contain only the PC12,34. Like human spermato-
zoa, POC1B, POC5, CETN1/2, and tubulin labeled the DC of
bovine spermatozoa (Supplementary Fig. 6a–b), and the sper-
matozoa lack CEP152 (an essential PCM protein) and SAS-6 (a
daughter centriole marker) (Supplementary Fig. 6b–c). Further-
more, the CEP152, SAS-6, POC1B, POC5, and CETN1/2 anti-
bodies recognize the centrosomes of undifferentiated bovine cells,
validating the antibody specificity (Supplementary Fig. 6d–h). In
addition, bovine spermatozoa shows an obvious “V” shape in the
DC using HyVolution confocal microscopy, suggesting that the
bovine DC is both similar in shape to, and bigger than the human
DC (Supplementary Fig. 6i–j). Together, the compositional
similarities and size increase make bovine sperm a good model to
examine the finer detail of the DC and its development.
The advantages of bovine sperm allowed us to closer
examination of the DC rods using stochastic optical reconstruc-
tion microscopy (STORM), which has a resolution limit of ~30
nm. In a side-view projection, we found that the bovine DC is
made of two main rods and one minor rod (Fig. 4a). Likewise, a
90° rotation projection clearly showed three dots representing a
top-view of the rods. The two major rods are about 350 nm long,

 whereas the minor rod is only about 300 nm long. The length is
twice as long as the human DC rods, which agrees with our
findings using HyVolution confocal microscopy (Figs. 3d, 4a,
Supplementary Fig. 6j). The distance between the tops of the rods
is approximately 370 nm, which is substantially wider than a
typical centriole. The distance between the rods at the base is only
230 nm, which is similar to the width of a typical centriole lumen.
Together, these dimensions suggest that the base of the rod’s “V”
shape is around the same size as a typical centriole lumen, but
then opens up much wider than a typical centriole.
To gain insight into the process of DC remodeling, we tracked
centrosomal proteins during bovine spermatogenesis. We found
that while CEP152 is present in spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and
round spermatids, its levels are dramatically reduced in elongated
spermatids (Fig. 4b, c). In contrast, we observed that as CEP152 is
dramatically reduced (by ~55%), CETN1/2 is slightly reduced (by
~17%), and POC5 is enriched (by ~68%) (Fig. 4c, d). A close look at
POC5 localization revealed that POC5 and CETN1/2 transforms
from a rounded focus, to an elongated focus, and then to “V”
during the
transition
from
round
spermatids to elongated
spermatids (Fig. 4b, d, e). These findings suggest that centriole
remodeling is accompanied by both protein reduction and protein
enrichment and that the structure of the DC is remodeled during
spermiogenesis, before the sperm has gained mobility.
The human DC is competent in vitro. To examine the function
of the DC, we used a cell-free centrosome reconstitution system that
exposes demembranated sperm to Xenopus egg extracts34,35. The
exposed sperm centrioles can recruit PCM proteins typically
involved in aster formation from the egg extract, thus simulating
the fertilization environment without creating embryos. This system
has previously demonstrated the essential role of the PCM protein
γ-tubulin in centrosome assembly and function35. Later, using
human sperm, it was found that the sperm centrosome was able to
recruit γ-tubulin, but the specific site of recruitment was not
investigated34. We employed this system to determine if the DC was
capable of recruiting γ-tubulin and found that the main site of γ-
tubulin recruitment was near the DC (Fig. 5a). This γ-tubulin
recruitment activity was specific to the sperm, as sperm fixed with
methanol were unable to recruit γ-tubulin (Fig. 5b, c). Altogether,
this suggests that the remodeled DC is competent to recruit PCM.
The bovine DC functions in zygote. Since the DC in human
spermatozoa is competent to recruit PCM, it may function as the
second centriole of the zygote. Indeed, in human zygotes, the
sperm axoneme is incorporated into the zygote where its base
associates with an aster near the male pronucleus that is known as
the sperm aster. Later during mitosis, the incorporated sperm
axoneme associates with one spindle pole34,36. This association
with the aster and the spindle pole could be an indication that the
axoneme-attached DC is functional.
To test this, we examined the ability of the DC in bovine
zygotes to recruit the PCM protein CEP152. In zygotes with
adjacent male and female pronuclei, we found a pair of CEP152-
labeled centrioles at the axoneme base, abutting a pronucleus. This
suggests that the DC recruits PCM and forms a functional
centrosome (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. 7a–d). Later, in
mitotic metaphase, we observed CEP152-labeled centrioles at both
poles of the bovine spindle. At the pole with the attached sperm
axoneme, we found a pair of CEP152-labeled centrioles (Fig. 6b
and Supplementary Fig. 7c). This suggests that the DC also
participates in spindle pole formation. Together, these findings
suggest that the DC functions as a centriole in the zygote.
Similar to prior work, we observed by differential interference
contrast (DIC) optics that the axoneme base nearest the paternal
pronucleus often splays into two fibers34,37 (Fig. 6a). This
axoneme base associates with the center of a microtubule aster,
which splits later to generate a second aster (Supplementary
Fig. 7d).
To determine if the DC was able to function as a platform for
the formation of a new daughter centriole, we labeled zygotes
with the daughter centriole protein SAS-6. We found that in
zygotes with closely apposed male and female pronuclei the
centrioles were retained at the bifurcated axoneme base (Fig. 6c
and Supplementary Fig. 7d). These centrioles were co-labeled
with CEP152 and SAS-6 within a single microtubule aster
(Fig. 6c–f and Supplementary Fig. 7d). Later, when the sperm
aster splits into two, we found a pair of centrioles at the center of
each microtubule aster. Each of these pairs contains two CEP152
foci, only one of which is associated with a SAS-6 focus
(Fig. 6g–m). One of the pairs is associated with the base of the
bifurcated sperm axoneme (Fig. 6g–j and Supplementary Fig. 7d).
Together, this suggests that centriole duplication occurs before
aster duplication, and when it takes place a single daughter
centriole forms in association with each of the sperm centrioles.
Importantly, this means that the atypical DC is able to act as
platform for the formation of a daughter centriole.
Discussion
In summary, we have found that the mammalian sperm centro-
some is remodeled during spermiogenesis. During the remodel-
ing, centrosomal proteins were eliminated, reduced, or enriched.
Many of these proteins were redistributed between the DC, PC,
and PCM. The centriole distal lumen proteins were redistributed
in the DC to form rods that associated with the splayed DC
microtubules. As a result, the remodeled DC had a general
appearance of truncated ovoid cone. The sperm provided the
zygote with two centrioles, a typical centriole (the PC) and an
atypical centriole attached to the axoneme base (the remodeled
DC), as well as a remodeled, structural PCM, the striated columns
and the capitulum. The DC was atypical but functional; in vitro, it
recruited γ-tubulin. In vivo, the DC recruited PCM, formed a
daughter centriole, and localized to one spindle pole in the zygote.
Altogether, our findings support a paternal inheritance model
where the sperm provides two functional centrioles, of varied
structure and composition, along with the associated PCM/stri-
ated columns structures.
While our findings elucidate the origin of the zygote’s cen-
trioles, they reveal a new enigma. The presence of a functional, yet
atypical DC raises the question of the purpose of the remodeled
structure. We have found previously that the Drosophila atypical
centriole is essential for normal fertility and embryo develop-
ment15, suggesting that the human atypical DC may be instru-
mental in fertility. The difference between the typical and atypical
centrioles may provide a cue for early embryonic development38.
Furthermore, it is possible that the remodeling step allows for
some flexibility in the neck region for sperm movement.
Additionally, our work raises questions regarding the fate of
the DC. If the DC remains attached to the bifurcated axoneme, as
we have observed, it does not appear capable of forming a cilium.
This may not be a problem as primary cilia form only in some cell
fates (the epiblast) at much later stages (post-implantation)39.
This work also has implications beyond the scope of reproductive
biology; because several other differentiated cell types are thought
to
lack centrioles,
it is
possible
that
they have
atypical
centrioles40,41.
Mammalian and insect sperm were thought to carry a single
functional centriole to the zygote. However, recently a second
centriole that is atypical was described in insect sperm15,16,25,42.
Similarly, here we show that mammalian sperm also have one

 typical and one atypical centriole. Together, these observations
argue for an evolutionarily conserved sperm centriole number
with variable structure, microtubule organization, and protein
composition. This conservation suggests that sperm centrioles
and their remodeling could play a critical role in fertility and early
embryo development. Understanding the precise mechanisms of

solve currently idiopathic forms of male infertility, generate novel
targets for male contraception43, and even support organelle

Methods
Sperm preparation. Ejaculated spermatozoa were obtained from Coba Select Sires
(bovine) and Manhattan Cryobank and Fairfax Cryobank (human). In all animals
tested, motile ejaculated spermatozoa were washed and selected using a Pure-
Ception density gradient according to instructions (Origio, ART-2004). All human
sperm samples were acquired after approval from the University of Toledo’s
Institutional Review Board and this work was declared exempt.
U2OS cells. U2OS cell were obtained from Dr. Deborah Chadee (University of
Toledo). They were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM;
Mediatech), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Atlanta Biologicals), at
37 °C in a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2.
Bovine cells and testes. TE11 p39 Bovine embryonic lung fibroblasts were
obtained from Dr. Toshihiko Ezashi and Dr. R. Michael Roberts of the University
of Missouri-Columbia. Bovine embryonic lung fibroblasts from 99-day fetuses were
generated by Dr. Neil Talbot in 2009. They were grown in DMEM (Mediatech),
supplemented with 10% FCS (Atlanta Biologicals), at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2. Bovine testes were purchased from
Scholl’s slaughterhouse in Blissfield Michigan. They were dissected and embedded
fresh in OCT (EMS Diasum 62550-01). The OCT-embedded testes were frozen on
dry ice and then sectioned. The 10 μm sections were stained in the immuno-
fluorescence protocol described below. As this work uses discarded tissue, no
approval was required from University of Toledo’s Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee.
Plasmids. POC1B312–406-His (amino acids 312–406 of NP_758440.1) in pQE10
vector were obtained from Dr. Chad Pearson45. POC1B312–406-GST was generated
using the QuickFusion kit to move a POC1B312-406 fragment from the pQE10
vector into a pGEX-3× plasmid between restriction enzymes Xma1 and EcoR1.
Protein purification. POC1B312–406 was grown in E. coli at 25 °C in lysogeny
broth with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and then stored at 4 °C for 3 h to overnight; we
then added 1 mM IPTG and incubated at 20 °C for 3 h. The bacteria were then
centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet
was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS, 105 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and
complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) and sonicated for 1 min at 10 s
intervals at 40% power. The sonicated cells were then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for
30 min. POC1B312–406-His was purified by nickel beads, and POC1B312–406-
GST was purified by glutathione bead affinity column. Purified protein was sepa-
rated on an SDS-Page gel, and corresponding bands were excised and used to
immunize rabbit and rats.
Antibodies. Antibodies were generated against purified POC1B312–406-His.
Polyclonal antibodies 537 and 538 were generated in rabbits by Pacific Immu-
nology. Monoclonal antibodies (5G5A7 and 5G5A10) were generated in rat by
ProMab using the purified POC1B312–406-His. Antibodies 537 and 538 were
affinity purified by Pacific Immunology using purified POC1B312–406-GST.
Antibodies 537 and 538 were used at a 1:100 dilution for immunofluorescence. The
rat monoclonals were used at 1:20 for immunofluorescence. The polyclonal anti-
bodies and rat monoclonal did not work well for western. All other antibodies used
are described in Supplementary Table 1.
Immunofluorescence. For immunofluorescence, 7 μL of PureCeption cleaned
spermatozoa were placed on a poly-lysine slide (Sigma-Aldrich, P5899) and a
Sigmacote coverslip (Sigma, SL2) was placed on top. The whole slide was then snap
frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen. Sperm slides were stored in liquid nitrogen;
when withdrawn, the coverslip was removed using forceps, and the slide was placed
in a pre-chilled Coplin jar of ice-cold methanol for 2 min. Next, the slide was placed
in 1× phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 1 min, then placed for 60 min in fresh 1×
PBS with 3% Triton X-1000 at room temperature. PBST-B was prepared by adding
1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to PBST, and slides were then placed in PBST-B
for 30 min. Primary antibodies diluted in PBST-B were added to slides at the
concentrations listed in Supplementary Table 1, after which the slides were covered
in parafilm, placed in a humidity chamber, and incubated at room temperature for
1 h or overnight at 4 °C. The slides were washed three times in PBST for 5 min each.
Next, the secondary antibody mixture was prepared by combining PBST, secondary
antibodies (see Supplementary Table 1B), and Hoechst 33258. The secondary
antibody mixture was added to slides, and they were covered in parafilm and
incubated for >1 h at room temperature. Slides were then washed three times with
PBST for 5 min each, followed by three times with 1× PBS for 5 min each. Finally,
the slides were sealed and imaged using a Leica Sp8 confocal microscope and some
images (Fig. 4) were processed using a Leica HyVolution 2 System.
Sperm images were taken at a magnification of 640× and zoom of 6×, with
512 × 512 pixel density. Using Photoshop, immunofluorescence sperm images were
cropped to 200 pixels by 100 pixels, or 100 pixels by 100 pixels.
Immunofluorescence U2OS images were cropped to 150 pixels by 150 pixels or 25
pixels by 25 pixels. The intensity was modified to allow easy visualization, and the
panels were resized to 300 DPI for publication. All photon counting was done with
a constant laser power that, in various experiments, ranged between 0.25 and 2%,
using CETN1/2, tubulin, or POC1B as a reference for centriole location.
Bovine zygote images in Fig. 4d were taken using a Nikon A1 four laser line
confocal microscope equipped with elements acquisition and analyses software and
were deconvolved. Multiple pictures of the bovine zygotes were taken, resulting in
some bleaching in areas that were taken at higher zoom.
Electron microscopy with high-pressure freezing. For TEM analysis of human
sperm centrioles, the ejaculated sperm were centrifuged in Eppendorf tubes (1.5
mL) at 1000 rpm for 1 min, and then the pellets were processed using the high-
pressure freezer system (Leica EM HPM100) in 20% BSA. The frozen samples were
dehydrated and stained en bloc using a freeze substitution preprocessor (Leica EM
AFS2) in 96% acetone with 1.5% OsO4 (osmium crystals dissolved in acetone and
4% water). The freeze substitution started with −90 °C for 6 h, then warmed from
−90 to −10 °C over 15 h (5.3° slope). Then the samples were warmed to −3 °C
over 1 h (7° slope) while being washed with 96% acetone (at −7 °C). They were
then warmed from −3 to 4 °C over 1 h (7° slope) while being washed twice with
100% acetone. Lastly, the dehydrated samples were infiltrated and embedded in
EMbed 812 resin while warming to room temperature. Ultrathin sectioning (70
nm) was performed using an ultramicrotome (Leica EM UC6), and sections were
post-stained with 6% uranyl acetate (in 1:1 70% ethanol and 100% methanol), and
Reynolds’ lead citrate (3–4% in preboiled double-distilled H2O). The sections were
imaged using TEM (JEOL 1400-plus), operating at 80 kV.
Correlative light and electron microscopy. Ejaculated sperm was obtained from
Fairfax CryoBank, and cleaned using the PureCeption kit (Origio, ART-2004).
Sperm cells were then immobilized on Poly L-lysine-coated coverslips, fixed with
1.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton-X-100, and immu-
nolabeled with POC1B antibody (as described above). The coverslip was mounted
in the imaging chamber, 200-nm-thick Z-sections through the sperm cells were
recorded to mark the position of fluorescent signals within the cells using a Nikon
Eclipse Ti inverted microscope equipped with a 13-µm pixel DU888 camera
(Andor) using a 100× NA 1.42 Plan Apo objective. High-magnification and low-
magnification (100× and 20×) DIC images were additionally recorded to ascertain
the position of sperm cells. Samples were then prepared for electron microscopy
analysis according to the standard protocol. Briefly, samples were pre-stained with
2% osmium tetroxide and 1% uranyl acetate, dehydrated, and embedded in EMbed
812 resin. 80-nm-thick serial sections were made, post-stained with uranyl acetate
and lead citrate, and imaged using a transmission electron microscope (Hitachi)
operating at 80 kV. Image analysis and the alignment of the serial sections were
performed using Fiji and Photoshop.
Super resolution microscopy. 3D-SIM data were acquired using an Elyra PS.1
microscope from Carl Zeiss, equipped with a plan-apochromat 63×/1.4 oil-
immersion objective lens with an additional 1.6× optovar. Images were collected
with an Andor iXon 885 EMCCD camera, resulting in a raw data pixel size of 79
nm. Z-stacks were acquired with a spacing of 101 nm/pixel. The fluorophores were
excited with a 200-mW 488-nm laser. Images were acquired with a laser power, at
the objective focal plane, of 52.6 mW, attenuated to 5%. Exposure times were
between 50–200 ms and EMCCD camera gain values between 5–20. Five phases at
each of three rotation angles (−75°, −15°, +45°) of the grid excitation pattern were
acquired. A 495–550 band-pass filter was used to collect fluorescence from Alexa
488 antibody-labeled samples. A 570–620 band-pass filter was used to collect
fluorescence excited with a wavelength of 555 nm. 5–8% power intensity was used.
The data were processed using the SIM module of the Zen software, version 8.1,
with Weiner filter between 10–3 and 10–5. Super resolution sperm images were
cropped to 50 × 50 pixels.
Bovine sperm was attached to 25 mm, 1.5, high precision cover glasses (Warner
Instruments), as described above for immunofluorescence. Anti-POC5 antibody
(Thermo Fisher PA5-24308) was used at 1:70. CF647-conjugated FAB2 antibodies
(Biotium) were used at 1:800 dilution to label primary antibodies. The anti-POC5
primary antibody was labeled by a Goat anti-rabbit Alexa 647 secondary antibody
(Biotum) at 1:800 dilution. Before STORM imaging, samples were layered with 100
nm tetra-spectral fluorescent spheres (Invitrogen), which served as fiducial

 markers. Coverslips were mounted to Attofluor Cell chambers (Thermo Fisher) in
imaging buffer (10% dextrose in 100 mM Tris at pH 8.0, 25 mM β-
mercaptoethylamine, 0.5 mg/mL glucose oxidase, and 67 μg/mL catalase). 3D
STORM imaging was performed on a Nikon N-STORM4.0 system using Eclipse Ti
inverted microscope, Apo TIRF 100× SA NA 1.49 Plan Apo oil objective, 405, 561,
488, and 647 nm excitation laser launch (Agilent) and a back-illuminated EMCCD
camera (Andor, DU897). The 647 nm laser line was used to promote fluorophore
blinking. 405 nm laser was used to reactivate fluorophores. 561 nm laser was used
to record the signals of fiducial markers. ~ 20,000 time points were acquired at a 50
Hz frame rate each 16–20 ms. NIS Elements (Nikon) was used to analyze and
present the data.
STED images of bovine and human sperm were stained as described above and
were acquired on a Leica SP8 with STED head at the University of Michigan.
Xenopus egg extract. Studies with Xenopus laevis were conducted in compliance
with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the University of Michigan
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Xenopus egg extract was generated
according to the methods of Murray and Kirschner46, with modifications from
Simerly et al.34 and Hannak and Heald47. In brief, Xenopus laevis females (obtained
from Nasco) were induced to ovulate by injecting human chorionic gonadotropin
(MP Biomedicals) into the dorsal lymph sac, and frogs were allowed to drop their
eggs overnight in Ca2+-free 1× Marc’s Modified Ringer’s solution (MMR: 100 mM
NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 5
mM HEPES, pH 7.8). Eggs were collected and dejellied using 2% cysteine in Ca2
+-free 1× MMR, pH 7.9, followed by washes in 50 mL each of extraction buffer
(XB: 100 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Hepes, 50 mM Sucrose, pH 7.7), XB-
cytostatic factor (CSF) (200 mL XB, 200 μL 1 M MgCl2, 1 mL 1M K-EGTA), and
XB-CSF with protease inhibitors (XB-CSF with 10 μg/mL each of leupeptin, chy-
mostatin, and pepstatin). Eggs were then transferred to a 4-mL Beckman Ultra-
Clear centrifuge tube (Beckman 344062), using a disposable plastic pipette with the
tip cut off, taking care to make sure the eggs were not exposed to air. The 4-mL
tube was placed inside a 13.2-mL Beckman Ultra-Clear centrifuge tube (Beckman
344059) as an adapter. The 4-mL tube was filled to the top with excess XB, and XB
was added to the outside of the 4-mL tube so that the level of the XB outside the
smaller tube matched the level of the eggs; this was done to prevent collapse of the
tube during centrifugation. The tubes were centrifuged for 2 min at 1600 rpm at 16
°C in a clinical centrifuge to pack the eggs. Excess liquid was removed using a
transfer pipette fitted with a 200-μL pipette tip. The tubes were then centrifuged at
11,500 rpm for 15 min at 16 °C using an SW41 hanging bucket rotor in a WX80
Sorvall ultracentrifuge to crush the eggs. The side of the tubes was pierced using an
18-gauge needle, and the straw-colored cytoplasmic layer was drawn into a 1-mL
syringe, taking care to avoid the vesicles close to the lipids at the top of the
cytoplasmic layer as well as the black nuclear layer below the cytoplasmic layer. The
needle was removed from the syringe, and the cytoplasmic extract was transferred
to an Eppendorf tube. The volume of the extract was estimated, then supplemented
with 1:50 energy mix (190 mM creatine phosphate, 25 mM ATP, 25 mM MgCl2,
2.5 mM EGTA, pH 7.7), 1:1000 leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin (10 mg/mL
stock), 1:3000 nocodazole (6 mg/mL stock), and 1:500 cytochalasin B (5 mg/mL
stock). This supplemented extract was stored for up to 2 h on ice prior to use. A
“control buffer” was made by supplementing XB-CSF with the energy mix, protease
inhibitors, nocodazole, and cytochalasin B.
PCM recruitment in vitro. PCM recruitment was preformed according to the
methods of Murray and Kirschner46 with modifications from Simerly et al34. In
brief, 50–100 μL PureCeption-washed sperm (see sperm preparation) was placed
onto a cleaned uncoated 12-mm circle glass coverslip (Fisher 12-545-81) and
allowed to bind for 10–20 min. The unbound sperm was removed, and the bound
sperm was permeabilized by adding 50–100 μL of 0.1% lysophosphatidyl choline
(Sigma L4129-25MG) diluted in Kenney’s Modified Tyrode’s medium (KMT: 100
mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, and 5 mM EGTA) for 10 min.
50–100 μL of Xenopus cell-free extract or control buffer was added to the coverslip
for 45–60 min at 37 °C. Coverslips were washed in KMT before being fixed in 20 °C
cold methanol (5 min) and immunostained as described above. For the methanol
pretreatments, the coverslips were fixed for 5 min in ice-cold methanol or 3.7%
formaldehyde at room temperature after permeabilization and before the extract
was added. Then they were washed in KMT before resuming the PCM recruitment
protocol.
Zygotes. Bovine in vitro fertilization and staining were performed as described
previously36,48. In brief, bovine oocytes were acquired from a slaughterhouse and
fertilized by Applied Reproductive Technology (AppliedReproTech). As this work
uses commercially available cells, approval was not required from University of
Toledo’s Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. They were shipped in
fertilization media (supplied by AppliedReproTech) overnight in an incubator at
39 °C. Upon receipt, cumulus cells were removed using a stripper pipette with 135-
μm tips (Origio MXL3-135) in the D1 growth media (provided by Applie-
dReproTech). Then cumulus-free zygotes were cultured at 39 °C with 5% CO2 until
a few zygotes divided (around 28–30 h). Zonae pellucidae were removed by soaking
them in a few mL 2% Pronase (Sigma 10165921001) in human tubal fluid (HTF)
for less than 2 min and were then fixed and prepared according to the methods of
Simerly and Schatten48. In brief, zona-free zygotes were dropped onto a poly-lysine
22-mm square coverslip immersed in protein-free, calcium-free HTF (the coverslip
sits in a 6-well dish, with the well full of HTF). We removed most of the HTF using
a pipette and replaced it with either 2% paraformaldehyde in HTF or Buffer M
(enough to fill the well), followed by ice-cold methanol (enough to fill the well) for
10–20 min.
Statistical methods. Experiments were repeated at least three times (N > 3), and
statistical analyses (average +/− standard deviation) were done with Excel. A two-
tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test was used to determine P-value (P). Chi-squared
tests were done as indicated where categorical data was available. ANOVA was
done in SPSS with Fisher’s LSD post hoc. P-value designations are: *P < 0.05, **P <
0.01, and ***P < 0.001.
Data availability. All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in
