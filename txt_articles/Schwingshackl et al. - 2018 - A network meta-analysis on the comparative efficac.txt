Abstract
The aim of the present study is to assess the comparative efficacy of different dietary approaches on glycaemic control
in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using a systematic review of the literature. Electronic and hand searches were
performed until July 2017. The inclusion criteria were defined as follows: (1) randomized trial with a dietary
approach; (2) adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus; (3) outcome either HbA1c (%) and/or fasting glucose (mmol/l); (4)
minimum intervention period of 12 weeks. For each outcome measure, random effects network meta-analysis was
performed in order to determine the pooled effect of each intervention relative to each of the other interventions. A
total of 56 trials comparing nine dietary approaches (low-fat, Vegetarian, Mediterranean, high-protein, moderate-
carbohydrate, low-carbohydrate, control, low GI/GL, Palaeolithic) enrolling 4937 participants were included. For
reducing HbA1c, the low-carbohydrate diet was ranked as the best dietary approach (SUCRA: 84%), followed by the
Mediterranean diet (80%) and Palaeolithic diet (76%) compared to a control diet. For reducing fasting glucose, the
Mediterranean diet (88%) was ranked as the best approach, followed by Palaeolithic diet (71%) and Vegetarian diet
(63%). The network analysis also revealed that all dietary approaches significantly reduce HbA1c (- 0.82 to - 0.47%
reduction) and fasting glucose (- 1.61 to - 1.00 mmol/l reduction) compared to a control diet. According to the
network meta-analysis the Mediterranean diet is the most effective and efficacious dietary approach to improve
glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes patients.

 Background
According to the most recent data by the International
Diabetes Federation and the World Health Organization,
type 2 diabetes (T2D) represents one of the most important
health problems, causing enormous costs, with an esti-
mated prevalence of 350–400 million cases worldwide
[1, 2].
To prevent onset of T2D, high-quality diets have been
recognized to play a critical role [3–5]. Nutrition therapy
plays an integral role in the management of T2D, partic-
ularly after initial clinical diagnosis, in order to reduce or
delay
diabetes
associated
complications.
One
major
approach is the loss of weight by a hypocaloric diet [6].
However, there is limited evidence on the optimal dietary
approaches to control hyperglycaemia in T2D patients [7]
and uncertainty regarding the optimal proportion of energy
coming from carbohydrates, protein, and fat for patients
with T2D [8].
Meta-analyses showed that some dietary approaches
such as a low-carbohydrate, low-glycaemic index/load,
high protein-, Vegetarian-, and Mediterranean dietary
approaches were effective in reducing HbA1c [9, 10].
Nevertheless, other meta-analyses reported conflicting
results [7, 11, 12].
One of the most important questions that remain to be
answered is which dietary approach offers the greatest
benefits. For answering this question, a promising method
is network meta-analysis (NMA), which is an extension of
pairwise meta-analysis that enables a simultaneous com-
parison of multiple interventions. NMA combines direct
(i.e., from trials comparing directly two interventions) and
indirect (i.e., from a connected root via one more inter-
mediate comparators) evidence in a network of trials
(Fig. 1). In this way, it enables inference about every
possible comparison between a pair of intervention in the
network even when some comparisons have never been
evaluated in a trial. A fundamental assumption of NMA,
often called the transitivity assumption, is that trials com-
paring different sets of interventions (e.g., AB and AC
trials) should be similar enough in all characteristics that
may affect the outcome. For more details on the method-
ology of NMA we directed the readers to relevant tutorials
[13–15].
To our knowledge, no study has been conducted that
compared simultaneously different dietary approaches in
the management of T2D. Therefore, our aim is to compare
the efficacy of different dietary approaches in clinical trials
on glycaemic control in patients with T2D using the novel
method of NMA.
Methods
The review was registered in PROSPERO International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews https://www.
crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=47
464 and our strategy for the systematic review and NMA
was pre-defined in a published protocol [16]. The present
systematic review was planned, conducted, and reported in
adherence to standards of quality for reporting systematic
reviews and NMA [17, 18].
Search strategy
The literature search was performed using the electronic
databases PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials (CENTRAL), and Google Scholar until July
2017 with no restriction to language and calendar date
using
a
pre-defined
search
strategy
(Supplementary
Appendix S1).
Furthermore, systematic reviews, and the reference lists
from the retrieved articles were screened to search for
additional relevant studies. Searches were conducted by
two
authors
with
disagreements
being
resolved
by
involvement of another reviewer.

Data extraction
After determination of the study selection, two reviewers
extracted the following characteristics: name of first author,
year of publication, study origin (country), study design
(RCT: parallel or cross-over), sample size, mean baseline
age, mean baseline BMI, mean baseline HbA1c, study
duration, sex, description of the different dietary inter-
vention arms, specification of the control group, type of
diet (energy restricted, ad libitum, iso-caloric), drop outs,
presence of comorbidities, hypoglycaemic drugs, antihy-
pertensive medication, lipid lowering medication. Outcome
data include: post-intervention values with corresponding
standard deviations for glycosylated haemoglobin and
fasting plasma glucose.
Risk of bias assessment
Full copies of the studies were assessed by two authors for
methodological quality using the risk of bias assessment
tool from the Cochrane Collaboration [34]. The following
sources of bias were assessed: selection bias (random
sequence generation and allocation concealment), perfor-
mance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), attri-
tion bias (incomplete outcome data), and reporting bias
(selective reporting).
Studies were classified as being at low risk of bias (if at
least three out of a maximum of five items were rated as
low risk; and maximum one item rated with a high risk of
bias), high risk of bias (if at least two out of a maximum of
five items were rated as high risk), and moderate/unclear
risk (all other studies) using the risk of bias assessment tool
from the Cochrane Collaboration.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted authors to receive missing outcome data (3
authors sent additional data, see acknowledgements). If the
post-intervention values with the corresponding standard
deviations were not available, the change scores with the
corresponding standard deviations were used, according to
the guidelines of the Cochrane Handbook [35].

 Evaluation of synthesis assumptions
Data synthesis
Description of the available data
We present for all included trials study and population
characteristics describing the available data and important
variables (e.g., age, length of follow-up, outcome relevant
baseline risk factors, etc.). We illustrate the available direct
comparisons between different dietary interventions and
control group using a network diagram for each outcome
[36]. The size of the nodes is proportional to the sample
size of each dietary intervention and the thickness of the
lines proportional to the number of studies available.
Assessment of transitivity
Transitivity is the fundamental assumption of indirect
comparisons and NMA, and its violation threatens the
validity of the findings obtained from a network of studies.
To evaluate the assumption of transitivity we compared the
distribution of the potential effect modifiers across the
available direct comparisons. We considered the following
effect modifiers: body weight, duration of diabetes, mean
baseline age, and study duration.
Statistical analysis
For each outcome measure of interest, we performed ran-
dom effects NMA in order to determine the pooled relative
effect of each dietary intervention against every other
intervention in terms of the post-intervention values. NMA
was used to synthesize the direct and indirect effects. The
method of NMA is an extension of the standard pairwise
meta-analysis that enables a simultaneous comparison of
multiple interventions, forming a connected network while
preserving the internal randomization of individual trials.
We ran random effects NMA for each outcome to estimate
all possible pairwise relative effects and to obtain a clini-
cally meaningful relative ranking of the different dietary
interventions. We present the summary mean differences
with their 95% CI in a league table. We estimated the
relative ranking of the different diets for each outcome
using the distribution of the ranking probabilities and the
surface under the cumulative ranking curves (SUCRA)
[37]. For each outcome we assumed a common network-
specific heterogeneity parameter and estimated the pre-
dictive intervals to assess how much this heterogeneity
affects the relative effects with respect to the additional
uncertainty anticipated in future studies [38]. We fitted all
analyses described in a frequentist framework using Stata
[39] (network package [40]) and produced presentation
tools with the network graphs package [41].
Assessment of inconsistency
To evaluate the presence of statistical inconsistency (i.e.,
disagreement between the different sources of evidence) in
the data, we employed both local and global approaches
[42]. Specifically, we used the loop-specific approach [43]
to detect loops of evidence that might present important
inconsistency as well as the side-splitting approach [44] to
detect comparisons for which direct estimates disagree
with indirect evidence from the entire network. Global
methods investigate the presence of inconsistency jointly
from all possible sources in the entire network simultane-
ously. For this purpose, we used the design-by-treatment
interaction model [45, 46].
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses
For comparability reasons, we performed subgroup analy-
ses in accordance to previous pairwise meta-analyses
investigating the effects of dietary interventions, by taking
into account study duration (C 12 vs. \ 12 months)
[19, 47], sample size (C 100 vs. \ 100) [48], and age
(C 60 vs. \ 60 years) [48]. We also conducted sensitivity
analyses by analysing only studies considered being at low
risk of bias, and by excluding risk of bias trials. We ran
also a meta-regression analysis to investigate the associa-
tion between the primary outcome (HbA1c) and mean
differences in weight change.
Small study effects and publication bias
We drew inference on the risk for publication bias based
primarily on non-statistical considerations; hence by con-
sidering how likely it is that studies may have been con-
ducted but not published based on the expertise of the
investigators in the field. We also produced the compar-
ison-adjusted funnel plot [36] and fit a network meta-re-
gression model to assess the magnitude of funnel plot
asymmetry for the primary outcome.
Credibility of the evidence
To make inferences about the credibility of evidence from
the NMA we used the GRADE system extended for NMA
following the approach suggested by Salanti et al. (see the
Supplementary Appendix S2 for details) [42].

 Results
Out of 3852 records identified by the literature search, 115
full text articles were assessed in detail as they reported on
one or more of dietary approaches and T2D in the title/
abstract (Supplementary Figure S1). Of these, 59 were
excluded, with the reasons for exclusion summarized in
Supplementary Table S1.
Overall, 56 trials [29, 49–103] met the eligibility criteria
and provided sufficient data to be included in the meta-
analysis. The included studies were published between
1978 and 2016 and had enrolled a total of 4937 T2D
patients. Eighteen trials were conducted in North America,
14 trials in Europe, 8 trials in Asia, and 16 trials in Aus-
tralia and New Zealand. The study duration ranged
between 3 and 48 months; the patients’ mean age was
between 44 and 67 years, and their BMI between 25 (Asian
population) and 43 kg/m2. The general and specific study
characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table S2
and S3.
Twenty-one trials were judged to be low risk–, seven
trials to be high risk of bias, and 28 trials were classified as
moderate/unclear risk of bias studies. With regard to the
specific items of the risk of bias assessment tool by the
Cochrane Collaboration, 56% of the included studies
indicate a low risk of bias for random-sequence generation,
23% for allocation concealment, 0% for blinding, 63% for
incomplete data outcome, and 79% for selective reporting
(Supplementary Figure S2).
The studies applied heterogeneous definitions for the
different intervention diets. The fat intake varied across the
different LF trials by * 10–15% of total energy intake,
and also the intervention protocols varied among the trials
(i.e., group meeting, dietary counselling, and intensity).
Moreover, hypocaloric, iso-caloric, and ad libitum diets
were included in the NMA. Moreover the definition of a
control diet showed some difference across the included
trials. Four out of the ten trials were based on ‘‘no inter-
vention’’, whereas the other six trials were based on min-
imal intervention (standard dietary advice). We thus had to
harmonize the single studies and formed classes of dietary
approaches.
Figure 2 shows the network diagrams of direct com-
parison for HbA1c with the number of studies reflected by
the size of the edges, and the number of patients reflected
by the size of the nodes. The highest number of trials
include moderate-carbohydrate diet compared to LF diets
[68–80] (n = 13), LF diet compared to control diets
[72, 73, 88–95] (n = 10), HP diet compared to LF diets
[60–67] (n = 8), and LC diet compared to LF diets
[57, 81–87] (n = 8).
NMA simultaneously analyse both direct comparisons
of interventions within trials and indirect comparisons
across trials based on a common comparator. Since none of
the
studies
have
compared
B
(Vegetarian)
and
C
(Mediterranean), but each has been compared with a
common comparator A (LF), then we assume an indirect
comparison of B and C on the direct comparison of B and
A and the direct comparison of C and A [104]. Table 1
shows the percentage of statistical contribution coming
from direct and indirect comparisons for each dietary
approach compared to each other. It was shown that most
of the contribution to the study effects came from indirect
comparisons. Direct comparisons dominated the compar-
isons of Vegetarian/Mediterranean/HP/moderate-carbohy-
drate/LC/LGI/GL/Palaeolithic/control diet with a LF diet
for both outcomes. In general, there are no important dif-
ferences in the examined effect modifiers across compar-
isons apart from the duration of diabetes which does not
seem to be distributed similarly across the different com-
parisons. For some comparisons such as LC versus LGI/
GL, LC versus moderate carbohydrate, LGI/GL versus
moderate carbohydrate, and Palaeolithic versus LF, we do
not have enough studies and we could not test transitivity
appropriately (Supplementary Figure S3–6).
The effect size estimates for the comparison of every
dietary
approach
compared
with
each
other
dietary
approach on HbA1c and fasting glucose outcomes are
given in Table 2. All dietary approaches were more
effective in reducing HbA1c (- 0.82 to - 0.47% reduc-
tion) and fasting glucose (- 1.61 to - 1.00 mmol/l
reduction) compared to a control diet. The Mediterranean
(MD: - 0.32, 95% - 0.53, - 0.11) and the LC diet (MD:
- 0.35, 95% - 0.56, - 0.14) were more effective in
reducing HbA1c compared to a LF diet. Moreover, the LC
diet was also more effective in HbA1c reduction compared
to a HP diet (MD: - 0.33, 95% - 0.61, - 0.05). The
Mediterranean diet was more effective in reducing fasting
glucose compared to a LF- (MD: - 0.61 mmol/l, 95%
- 1.03, - 0.20) and LGI/GL diet (MD: - 0.59 mmol/l,
95% - 1.13, - 0.04) (Supplementary Figure S7 and S8,
Table 2). In addition, the LGI/GL diet was associated with
a trend for a reduction in HbA1c compared to the LF diet
(MD: - 0.16, 95% - 0.31, - 0.00). The LC diet had the
highest SUCRA value (84%), followed by the Mediter-
ranean diet (80%), and Palaeolithic diet (76%) for HbA1c,
whereas the Mediterranean diet (88%) had the highest
SUCRA value for fasting glucose, followed by Palaeolithic
diet (71%) and Vegetarian diet (63%) (Table 2). The
rankograms did not imply the presence of important
uncertainty in ranking for HbA1c; more uncertain appeared
to be the relative ranking for fasting glucose though
(Supplementary Figure S9 and S10).

 The side-splitting approach suggested important incon-
sistency for HbA1c in the comparisons of LF versus LC,
LF versus control diet, and moderate-carbohydrate versus
LC diet (Supplementary Table S4 and S5). For fasting
glucose, significant inconsistency was observed for LF
versus LC diet and moderate-carbohydrate versus LC diet.
The loop-specific approach showed important inconsis-
tency in the loop formed by the aforementioned diets for
both outcomes (Supplementary Figure S11 and S12). The
design-by-treatment model showed also significant incon-
sistency for HbA1c (p = 0.03), but not for FG (p = 0.32).
This apparent inconsistency might reflect the low con-
tribution of direct comparisons to the total estimate. The
important inconsistency in the loop for LF versus moder-
ate-carbohydrate and LC might be explained by several
differences across LF dietary approaches (hypocaloric if
compared to a control diet; often iso-caloric if compared to
other dietary approaches), differences in ratio of fat to
carbohydrate intake, and differences in fatty acid compo-
sition among moderate carbohydrate approaches and LC
dietary approaches (larger weight loss compared to other
interventions).
In the subgroup analyses for study duration, sample size,
and age we could show that LC diets were more effective
in reducing HbA1c in the shorter-term (
\ 12 months), in
smaller size studies, and including patients C 60 years.
Mediterranean, moderate-carbohydrate and LGI/GL, HP,
and LF diets were more effective in reducing HbA1c in the
longer-term, in larger size studies, and in studies including
patients
\ 60 years
(Supplementary
Table
S6–11).
Although the power was very small for several compar-
isons, these characteristics may partly explain the presence
of inconsistency. Furthermore, in the low-risk of bias
sensitivity analysis the results of the primary analysis were
generally confirmed. Hence, both the Mediterranean diet
and the LC diet were more effective to decrease HbA1c
compared to a LF diet, whereas the results for FG were not
significant (Supplementary Table S12). All the results of
the main analysis were confirmed in the sensitivity analysis
excluding
high
risk
of
bias
trials
(Supplementary
Table S13). In univariate meta-regression analysis we
could show that mean reduction in HbA1c was significantly
(p = 0.04) related to mean difference in weight change
between dietary approaches (Supplementary Figure S11).
The comparison-adjusted funnel plots for both outcomes
appear slightly asymmetric when LF dietary approaches
were compared to all other dietary approaches. However,
the network meta-regression model that accounted for
differences in study variance did not yield a statistically
significant coefficient (Supplementary Figure S14 and
S15).
The credibility of evidence was rated very low for the
comparisons Mediterranean versus LF; LC versus LF; LGI
versus LF, moderate-carbohydrate versus LC, Mediter-
ranean versus HP, and LC versus HP. The very low cred-
ibility was driven by significant inconsistency. For the
other comparisons the credibility of evidence was rated
low, and for three comparisons the quality of evidence was
rated moderate (LF vs. Palaeolithic, Mediterranean vs.
Palaeolithic, LGI/GL vs. Palaeolithic) (Supplementary
Figure S16, Supplementary Appendix S2).
Discussion
By applying NMA, we ranked 9 different dietary approa-
ches (Vegetarian, Mediterranean, HP, moderate-carbohy-
drate, LC, LGI/GL, Palaeolithic, LF and control diet)
regarding their comparative efficacy for glycaemic control
in patients with T2D. The ranking according to SUCRA
showed the highest value for the LC diet, followed by the
Mediterranean diet, and Palaeolithic diet for HbA1c,
whereas the Mediterranean diet had the highest SUCRA
value for fasting glucose, followed by Palaeolithic diet and
Vegetarian diet. However, the credibility of evidence was
rated very low for the LC, as well as for some comparison
with the Mediterranean diet. The NMA also revealed that
all dietary approaches significantly reduce HbA1c (- 0.47
to - 0.82% reduction) and fasting glucose (- 1.00 to
- 1.61 mmol/l reduction) compared to a control diet.
In line with our observations, pairwise meta-analyses
have shown that LC diets were more effective in HbA1c
and body weight reduction in the short-term compared to
other diets, whereas no superiority was observed in the
long-term [105, 106]. Weight loss as an important effect
modifier for HbA1c and fasting glucose reduction may
potentially explain the observed inconsistency between LC
and the other dietary approaches. Despite the moderate
quality of evidence grading in the NMA, the findings for
Palaeolithic diet should be interpreted with caution since
only one trial was available. Finally, it is important to note
that LC diets were more effective in reducing HbA1c in
patients C 60 years, whereas the Mediterranean, moderate-
carbohydrate, LGI/GL, HP, and LF diets were more
effective in HbA1c reduction in patients \ 60 years,
compared to patients C 60 years. Irrespective of the age of
the study participants, HbA1c reductions have been
reported to be of similar degree following either LC or LF
dietary regimens [87]. In contrast, other studies demon-
strated stronger decreases in HbA1c in individuals sub-
jected to a LC approach [73]. It remains speculative
whether these differences might be due to an age-depen-
dency of LC effectiveness as shown in the present sub-
group analysis. Given the fact that various authorities have
proposed specific guidelines for glycemic control in older
adults [107, 108] to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia,
164

 these observations need to be confirmed by larger RCTs
mainly in patients C 60 years.
In the past, with traditional pairwise meta-analysis,
Ajala and co-workers compared various diets modifying
macronutrient intake on glycaemic control and weight loss
in patients with T2D [10]. In 2003, Brand-Miller et al.
[109] could show a beneficial effect specifically of LGI
foods as compared to regular or high GI diets on HbA1c
and fructosamine in subjects with type 1 or type 2 diabetes,
however, this study included mostly randomized trials with
a duration time of less than 12 weeks, whereas we included
only
trials
with
a
minimum
intervention
period
of
12 weeks. The duration of time is an important factor in
dietary- and overall lifestyle intervention trials, since par-
ticipants adherence declines over time, and improvements
in risk factors are often larger in the short term, compared
to the longer term [57, 110].
Comparable effects were shown for carbohydrate-re-
stricted diets by Kirk et al. [111]. In a meta-analysis of
RCTs by Huo et al. [112], a Mediterranean diet did result in
significantly more pronounced decreases in parameters of
glycaemic control and weight loss as compared to control
diets. In addition, Dong et al. [113] observed improvements
in HbA1c but not in fasting plasma glucose following a
meta-analytical synthesis of data from randomized trials
comparing HP with low-protein diets. In another meta-
analysis, Yokoyama et al. [9] demonstrated favourable
effects of Vegetarian diets on glycaemic control in patients
with T2D. The results of our NMA extend the current
knowledge from previous pairwise meta-analyses, since we
were the first to rank 9 different dietary approaches
regarding their comparative efficacy by analysing simul-
taneously both direct and indirect effects. We could show
that a plant-based diet such as the Mediterranean diet is the
most effective dietary approach to improve glycaemic
control in T2D patients. This will affect evidence-based
decision-making with respect to dietary regimens by pro-
viding a reliable basis for dietary recommendations in the
management of T2D.
With respect to mechanisms of action, the effects of LC
diets, Mediterranean diets or Palaeolithic diets on HbA1c
might be mediated by their higher amounts of food groups
such as fruits, vegetables, or whole grains providing
antioxidants or fibre, known to improve insulin sensitivity
or to directly inhibit production of advanced glycosylated
end products [114–116]. The additional benefit of a
Mediterranean diet on fasting plasma glucose might be
exerted via dietary polyphenols (e.g., flavonoids, phenolic
acids, resveratrol, lignans) provided by key components of
the Mediterranean diet such as olive oil, nuts, red wine,
legumes, fruits, and vegetables [48, 117–119]. Moreover,
the meta-regression analysis showed that HbA1c reduction
was significantly related to mean differences in weight
change, indicating that weight loss is another important
mechanism to improve glycaemic control.
Both HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose are considered
to be clinical tools for the assessment of glycaemic control.
However, these parameters might not accurately determine
short-term fluctuations in glycaemia within a day or long-
term variations within several months. Glycaemic vari-
ability is supposed to be an independent predictor of dia-
betic complications [120].
Optimal control of glycaemic parameters in T2D sub-
jects is an essential step to reduce the risk of long-term
health damages associated with the disease. According to
the Asian Pacific Study, attenuations in fasting glucose
levels of 1 mmol/l are associated with a 23% lower risk of
CVD [121]. Moreover, the authors of the United Kingdom
Prevention Study considered hyperglycaemia to be a more
relevant predictor of coronary events in the course of T2D
when compared with increased insulin levels [122]. In a
retrospective study by Currie et al. [123] investigating
47,970 patients with T2D, HbA1c values higher than 6.5%
were associated with an increased mortality rate. In the
EPIC-Norfolk study, an increase in HbA1c of 1 percentage
point was associated with a 20–30% increase in mortality
or in risk of cardiovascular events [124]. Likewise, an
HbA1c increase of 1 percentage point was associated with
a relative risk for death from any cause of 1.24 in men and
1.28 in women [124]. This underlines the validity of
HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose in monitoring the
management of T2D.
Strength and limitations
This systematic review includes the application of novel
NMA methods, which simultaneously combine direct and
indirect evidence. Additional strengths are the high number
of included trials, the comprehensive literature search, the a
priori published systematic review protocol, identification
of
inconsistency,
and
the
credibility
of
evidence
assessment.
A limitation of this review lies within the number and
qualities of the studies available. Overall, 7 of 56 trials
were at high risk of bias mostly due to lack of allocation
concealment, and blinding. However, the sensitivity anal-
ysis excluding the high risk of bias trials confirmed all the
results of main NMA. Another important limitation is that
analyses were based on the original intended randomized
design, not by adherence to the actual dietary approach
and/or macronutrient composition and caloric intake con-
sumed. This means that although patients were randomized
to various diets or controls, details on their actual adher-
ence to the dietary program were not accounted for in the
analyses. The heterogeneous definition for the different
dietary approaches and the overlap between some dietary

 approaches is another limitation. In some cases a LGI/GL
or a HP diet would also fulfil the criteria of a LF diet,
whereas on the contrary a LF would never fulfil the criteria
of other dietary approaches. The observed statistical
inconsistency, which was also reflected in the GRADE
assessments, is another important limitation of the ranking
and lowers the confidence in the effect estimates being
used in the analysis. As shown in the subgroup analyses we
observed significant differences between LC compared to
other dietary approaches for study duration, sample size,
and patients’ age.
Conclusion
According to the NMA, the Mediterranean diet seems to be
the most effective and efficacious dietary approach to
improve glycaemic control in T2D patients. These findings
need to be seen under the light of very low to moderate
credibility of evidence. However, the findings could nev-
ertheless influence dietary recommendations in the man-
agement of T2D.
