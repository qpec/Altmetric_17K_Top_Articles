IMPORTANCE Among patients who undergo the 21-gene assay (21-GA), 39% to 67% receive
an intermediate risk result and may receive ambiguous treatment guidance. The 70-gene
signature assay (70-GS) may be associated with physicians’treatment decisions in this
population with early breast cancer.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether 70-GS findings are associated with physicians’decisions
about adjuvant treatment and confidence in their recommendations and to evaluate the
dichotomous (high- vs low-risk) and continuous distribution of 70-GS indices among this
group of patients with intermediate risk.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Prospective Study of MammaPrint in Breast Cancer
Patients With an Intermediate Recurrence Score (PROMIS trial) was an impact study
conducted from May 20, 2012, through December 31, 2015, that enrolled 840 patients with
early-stage breast cancer and a 21-gene assay recurrence score of 18 to 30. Patients were
treated in 58 US institutions.
INTERVENTIONS The 70-GS result was given to physicians before adjuvant treatment.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in physician treatment decision before vs after
receiving the 70-GS result. With a treatment change of greater than 20%, the odds ratio (OR)
was applied.
RESULTS Among the 840 patients who underwent 70-GS classification (mean age, 59 years;
range, 27-93 years), 374 (44.5%) had a low-risk and 466 (55.5%) had a high-risk result. The
distribution of 70-GS indices did not correlate with recurrence score within the 21-GA
intermediate range, with 70-GS low- and high-risk patients observed at every recurrence
score. A significant change in adjuvant treatment was associated with receiving the 70-GS
classifications with an OR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.50-0.82; McNemar test, P < .001) for all
patients. Among the low-risk patients, 108 of 374 (28.9%) had chemotherapy removed from
their treatment recommendation; among the high-risk patients, 171 of 466 (36.7%) had
chemotherapy added. Results of the 70-GS were associated with the physician’
s adjuvant
treatment recommendation; 409 high-risk patients (87.8%) were recommended to receive
adjuvant chemotherapy, and 339 low-risk patients (90.6%) were recommended no
chemotherapy. Physicians reported having greater confidence in their treatment
recommendation in 660 cases (78.6%) based on 70-GS results.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 70-GS provides clinically actionable information
regarding patients classified as intermediate risk by the 21-GA and was associated with a
change in treatment decision in 282 of these patients (33.6%). Chemotherapy was added or
withheld by the treating physician based on the results of the 70-GS test. Physicians reported
more confidence with their treatment recommendation after receiving 70-GS results.

he70-genesignatureassay(70-GS)isaUSFoodandDrug
Administration–cleared molecular diagnostic assay that
provides a binary classification for patients with early-
stage breast cancer into low or high risk for breast cancer re-
currence. The 70-GS was developed by identifying the genes
most correlated with disease outcome in systemically un-
treated patients. The signature probes were selected in a data-
drivenandunbiasedfashionfromapproximately25 000genes
representing the entire human genome.1 The 70-GS was evalu-
ated in a randomized, prospective, phase 3 clinical trial that
validated the clinical utility of the assay in patients with early
breast cancer, regardless of estrogen receptor (ER) or human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status. The Micro-
array in Node-Negative and 1 to 3 Positive Lymph Node Dis-
ease May Avoid Chemotherapy (MINDACT) trial provided evi-
dence that patients with a 70-GS low risk could safely forego
chemotherapy (CT) without detrimentally affecting outcome.2
The 70-GS identified 46% of clinically high-risk patients as ge-
nomically low risk, with 5-year distant metastasis–free sur-
vival of 94.7%, similar to 95.0% among patients classified as
clinically low risk. Among patients with ER-positive, lymph
node (LN)–negative, HER2-negative disease who were at clini-
cally and 70-GS low risk, 98.4% had a distant metastasis–free
interval at 5 years without CT.
The 21-gene assay (21-GA) was developed by selecting 16
genes associated with recurrence-free survival in patients with
ER-positive, HER2-negative findings who received 5 years of
tamoxifen therapy. These cancer-related genes (ER, PR, BCL2,
SCUBE2, Ki67, STK15, Survivin, cyclin B1, MYBL2, MMP11,
CTSL2, GFB7, HER2, GSTM1, CD68, and BAG1) and 5 refer-
ence genes were chosen from a panel of 250 candidate genes
curated from published literature and genomic databases. The
retrospective analysis of tamoxifen-treated patients from the
National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP)
B-14 trial was used to validate the 21-GA. The trial showed sig-
nificantlybetter10-yeardistantrecurrence–freesurvivalamong
patients classified as low risk by the 21-GA (recurrence score
[RS], <18) compared with patients classified as high risk (RS,
>30), but the results for the group with intermediate risk
(RS, 18-30) were inconclusive.3 Similar to the MINDACT trial,
the Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment
(TAILORx) plans to report results validating the clinical util-
ity of the 21-GA in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative,
LN-negative breast cancer.4 However, unlike the MINDACT
trial, the low- and high-risk patients are not being random-
ized to receive CT. All patients with an RS less than 11
(TAILORx low risk) are forgoing CT, and all patients with an
RS of at least 26 (TAILORx high risk) are receiving CT. Only pa-
tients with an RS of 11 to 25 (TAILORx intermediate risk) have
been randomized to receive CT. Of note, the categorical risk
classifications in TAILORx have lower RS cutoffs for low, in-
termediate, and high risk than the clinically validated ranges
from the NSABP B-14 and B-20 trials.
The 21-GA gives an intermediate result (RS clinical range,
18-30; TAILORx trial range, 11-25) for 39% to 67% of patients
undergoing testing,4,5 leaving many physicians and patients
without definitive treatment guidance. The frequency of in-
termediate RS results has been higher in practice than Paik et
al3 anticipated when the assay was first developed and later
validated.4,5 The purpose of the Prospective Study of Mam-
maPrint in Breast Cancer Patients With an Intermediate Re-
currence Score (PROMIS trial) was to evaluate the clinical
utility of the 70-GS in a US clinical practice setting, specifi-
cally in a patient population with an intermediate 21-GA
result (RS, 18-30).
Methods
Study Population
The PROMIS trial enrolled 876 patients with breast cancer and
an intermediate 21-GA result from May 20, 2012, through De-
cember31,2015.Eighteenpatientsdidnotpassthe70-GSqual-
ity check. An additional 18 patients were removed from this
analysis for the following reasons: 4 were ineligible for un-
known reasons, 1 did not complete the informed consent form,
2 withdrew for unknown reasons, 3 started treatment before
receiving the test result, 3 had a history of cancer treatment,
3 were duplicated in the enrolled population, and 2 had un-
resolved case report form queries. The 840 eligible patients
had LN-negative or LN-positive (N1) disease, were negative for
HER2,andwerepositiveforhormonereceptor.Enrollmentwas
contingent on receiving a successful 70-GS (ie, MammaPrint)
result. The industry-sponsored trial was approved by institu-
tional review boards in all 58 participating US institutions and
registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01617954).6 Before
enrollment,patientswererequiredtoprovidewritteninformed
consent to participate and for research use of their tumor
samples.
Originally, the trial was only open to patients with LN-
negative disease; the protocol was amended in March 2013 to
allow for the inclusion of patients with LN-positive disease. By
this time, the validity of the 70-GS and 21-GA in patients with
as many as 3 positive nodes had been validated in multiple
studies.7,8 The inclusion of patients with LN-positive disease
inthePROMIStrialalsocoordinatedwiththeconcurrentlyrun-
ning MINDACT (70-GS) and Rx for Positive Node, Endocrine
Responsive Breast Cancer (RxPONDER; 21-GA) trials,9 both of
whichwereenrollingpatientswithasmanyas3positivenodes.
Key Points
Question Are 70-gene signature assay findings associated with
physicians’treatment decisions for patients with intermediate
findings on the 21-gene assay?
Findings In this study of 840 patients with early breast cancer,
282 physicians (33.6%) changed their treatment decision after
receiving the 70-gene assay result. Adjuvant chemotherapy was
added and removed so that 88% of high-risk patients were
recommended to receive chemotherapy and 91% of low-risk
patients were recommended no chemotherapy.
Meaning The 70-gene signature assay provides clinically
actionable information, and the findings may be associated with
adjuvant therapy decisions.

 Adjuvant therapy was at the discretion of the treating physi-
cian. Physicians provided their recommended adjuvant treat-
ment plan before the 70-GS results were available. After re-
ceivingthe70-GSresults,thesametreatingphysicianprovided
his or her recommended treatment plan again.
Molecular and Immunohistochemical Assessment
The 70-GS was performed at the centralized Agendia labora-
tory in Irvine, California, according to standard protocols de-
scribed previously.10 This test is based on microarray gene ex-
pression analysis of RNA extracted from formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded breast tumor tissue and uses custom-
designed array chips manufactured by Agilent Technologies.
The 70-GS provides a numerical index ranging from −1.000 to
1.000 and a dichotomous categorization of low risk or high risk
depending on whether the index is greater than 0 (low risk)
or 0 or less (high risk). The 70-GS index is calculated from the
correlation of a patient’
s tumor profile to known low- and high-
risk tumor profiles. Therefore, the more extreme the 70-GS
index value, the more similar the tumor is to the hallmark
low- or high-risk profiles. The statuses of ER, progesterone re-
ceptor (PR), HER2, and Ki67 were determined by the local in-
stitution using pretreatment samples according to American
Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Patholo-
gists testing guidelines.11-13
Statistical Analysis
Availabledatafrompreviousstudieswereusedtocalculatethe
target sample size needed to investigate the hypothesis of a
20% overall treatment change with sufficient power after re-
vealing 70-GS results to the investigator (820 participants for
a significance level of .05 and power of 0.90). The overall treat-
ment change was defined as the percentage of patients with a
change from their baseline treatment recommendation after
receiving the 70-GS result. The frequency of CT recommen-
dations for patients with intermediate 21-GA findings was cal-
culated before and after receiving the 70-GS test results. The
odds ratio (OR) for patients recommended not to receive CT
after receiving the 70-GS result compared with those recom-
mended to undergo CT before receiving the 70-GS result was
determined, and the McNemar test was performed to assess
the significance of the 2 proportions (mcnemar.exact func-
tion in the exact 2 × 2 library). The χ2 test (binary variables),
nonparametric Mann-Whitney test (for continuous variables
[2 groups]), and nonparametric Kruskall-Wallis tests (continu-
ous variables [>2 groups]) were used for the comparison of
population characteristics in different subgroups. Linear re-
gression was used to model the association between the 70-GS
index and 21-GA RS. Multivariate logistic regression analysis
was performed to determine whether clinicopathologic fac-
tors were associated with the change in treatment decision. All
statistical tests were 2 tailed, and the statistical significance
threshold was P < .05. Most calculations were performed with
R software (version 3.2.2; R Project); multivariate analysis was
calculated using SPSS software (version 22.0; IBM).
Results
Baseline Patient, Tumor, and Treatment Characteristics
The 840 participants in the PROMIS study included predomi-
nantly postmenopausal women (mean age, 59 years; range,
27-93 years), most of whom were white (733 [87.3%]) (eTable
1 in the Supplement). The tumors included 636 T1 (75.7%),
198 T2 (23.6%), 744 LN negative (88.6%), 203 well differenti-
ated (24.2%), 479 moderately differentiated (57.0%), 157
poorly differentiated (18.7%), and 665 invasive ductal carci-
noma (79.2%). As expected, most of the women were ER
positive (839 [99.9%]; 1 patient had unknown ER immuno-
histochemical status) and HER2 negative (821 [97.7%]; 19
[2.3%] had unknown or equivocal findings) by locally
assessed immunohistochemical analysis.
Perprotocol,allpatientshadanintermediate21-GARSfrom
18 to 30, with a median RS of 22 (interquartile range, 20-25).
Patients with LN-positive disease were present at every RS in
theintermediaterange.Basedonthe21-GAresult(before70-GS
assessment), 382 patients (45.5%) were recommended to re-
ceive adjuvant CT and 458 (54.5%) were recommended not to

The recommendation to receive CT was more frequent among
patients with an RS above 26 (68 [66.0%] CT and 35 [34.0%]
no CT) and less frequent among those with an RS below 21 (96
[31.9%] CT and 205 [68.1%] no CT). In the middle of the inter-
mediaterange(RS,21-26),whichrepresents436patients(51.9%
of the trial population), an equal number of patients (218 each)
were recommended to receive and to forego CT (Figure 1).

 70-GS Result
The 70-GS reclassified the 840 intermediate patients as low
risk in 374 cases (44.5%) and high risk in 466 cases (55.5%)
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). These high-risk and low-risk pa-
tients were found at every RS in the intermediate range. The
scatterplot comparing the 2 continuous variables (Figure 2)
showsthatthedistributionofindicesacrossthedynamicrange
of the 70-GS index was similar between patients with RS from
18 to 30. In a regression model, a comparison of the 70-GS in-
dex and 21-GA RS showed that the 2 test results were inde-
pendent in the 21-GA intermediate range (adjusted R2 = 0.14;
P < .001), meaning that patients with a more extreme low-
risk70-GSindex(closerto1.0)didnotalsohavealowerRSscore
(closer to 18) and vice versa. We found no statistical differ-
ence in distributions between 70-GS low-risk and high-risk pa-
tients by tumor staging (T1c, 163 [43.6%] vs 216 [46.4%]), nodal
staging (N0, 272 [72.7%] vs 326 [70.0%]), age (mean of 58
[range, 27-87] years vs 59 [range, 2-93] years), ER status (374
[100%] vs 465 [99.8%] positive), PR status (318 [85.0%] vs 400
[85.8%] positive), or HER2 status (369 [98.7%] vs 452 [97.0%]
negative)(χ2test,P > .05).Intheintermediategroup,wefound
a significant difference between 70-GS high- and low-risk pa-
tients in histologic grade (G1, 136 [36.4%] vs 67 [14.4%]; G2,
216 [57.8%] vs 263 [56.4%]; and G3, 21 [5.6%] vs 136 [29.2%];
P < .001), tumor type (invasive lobular cancer, 75 [20.1%] vs
47 [10.1%]; P < .001), menopausal status (premenopausal and
perimenopausal status, 102 [27.3%] vs 87 [18.7%]; P = .005),
and ethnicity (black, 18 [4.8%] vs 48 [10.3%]; P = .032).
Association of the 70-GS With Adjuvant Therapy
Recommendations
The 70-GS classifications were associated with significant
changes in CT treatment decisions to add or withhold CT
(Table 1) (χ2 test, P < .001). The OR for removing CT was sig-
nificantly higher for 70-GS low-risk patients who were ini-
tially recommended CT (OR, 108.00; 95% CI, 18.98-4304.77;
McNemar P < .001) and was significantly lower for 70-GS high-
risk patients who were initially recommended CT (OR, 0.01;
95% CI, 0.001-0.04; McNemar P < .001). Among all patients,
the odds of patients recommended not to receive CT after re-
ceiving the 70-GS compared with patients initially recom-
mended to receive CT before receiving the 70-GS test was 0.64
(95% CI, 0.50-0.82; McNemar P < .001). Overall, 282 adju-
vant treatment recommendations (33.6%) changed after re-
ceipt of the 70-GS result; 108 of 374 patients (28.9%) with a
low-risk70-GSresulthadCTremovedfromtheirtreatmentrec-
ommendation, and 171 of 466 patients (36.7%) with a high-
risk 70-GS result had CT added to their treatment recommen-
dation. One patient with a low-risk 70-GS result had CT added,
and 2 patients with high-risk 70-GS results had CT removed
from their treatment recommendations. In this ER-positive
population, 794 of 840 patients (94.5%) were recommended
endocrine therapy (HT) before and 803 (95.6%) after the 70-GS
(Table 2). Thirty-one patients had a change in HT recommen-
dation.For9patientsforwhomCTwasremoved,HTwasadded
tothetreatmentrecommendation.Among11patientsforwhom
CT was added, 7 had HT removed and 4 had HT added. Among
11 patients with no change in CT recommendation, 4 had HT
removed and 7 had HT added.
When analyzing the subgroup of 368 patients for whom
the original physician-selected treatment recommendation
(based on the intermediate 21-GA) conflicted with that indi-
cated by the 70-GS, 279 (75.8%) of these patients had their
treatment regimen changed; 108 of 142 70-GS low-risk pa-
tients who originally were recommended to receive CT had CT
removedfromtheirtreatmentrecommendation,and171of226
70-GS high-risk patients who originally were not recom-
mended to receive CT had CT added to their treatment rec-
ommendation after the 70-GS result (Table 1). Overall, results

 of the 70-GS were associated with physician adjuvant treat-
ment recommendations; 339 of 374 low-risk patients (90.6%)
were recommended no adjuvant CT, and 409 of 466 high-
risk patients (87.8%) were recommended adjuvant CT.
The change in treatment decision was the same regard-
less of LN status; 251 of 744 patients with LN-negative dis-
ease (33.7%) and 27 of 84 patients with LN-positive disease
(32.1%) had a change to their CT treatment decision (eTable 2
in the Supplement). The decision to change treatment was sig-
nificant in both groups (χ2 test, P < .001 for LN-negative and
P = .004 for LN-positive disease). Multivariable analysis
showed that the 70-GS was the only independent variable sig-
nificantly associated with the change in CT decision (hazard
ratio, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.31-2.63) (Table 3). Nodal status, tumor
stage, grade, histologic type, age, race, and menopausal or PR
status were not associated with the change in CT decision.
After receiving the 70-GS result, physicians were queried
in every case as to how the result influenced their confidence
level regarding the chosen treatment plan. Physicians re-
ported greater confidence in their treatment recommenda-
tions in 660 cases (78.6%), reduced confidence in 49 cases
(5.8%), and no effect on confidence in 131 cases (15.6%) after
receiving the 70-GS result. Although all of the PROMIS study
sites had previously used the 21-GA, one-third of the partici-
pating sites were not 70-GS users before the trial and two-
thirds were not regular or exclusive users of the 70-GS.
Discussion
Molecular diagnostic tests supplement a physician’
s toolbox
by giving information on a disease beyond that provided by
traditional clinicopathologic features. Genomic tests, such as
the 70-GS (ie, MammaPrint), the 21-GA (ie, Oncotype DX
[Genomic Health]), Mapquant Dx (IPSOGEN SA), the 76-gene
signature (ie, Rotterdam signature [Veridex]), EPclin
(ie, EndoPredict [Myriad Genetics]), and the 50-gene assay
(ie,PAM50orProsigna[NanoString]),usegeneexpressionpro-
filingforprognosticpurposes.14Someoftheseassaysthencom-
bine the gene expression profile with clinical factors in their
algorithms to give a single risk appraisal. These tests are most
useful when clinical assessments leave questions unan-
swered about a patient’
s risk for disease recurrence and re-
sponse to a proposed treatment.
Gage et al15 have argued that clinicopathologic factors may
drive the 21-GA’
s overall performance, citing the NSABP B-20
trial validation. They suggest that patients deemed to be at low
andhighriskbythe21-GAcouldhavebeenidentifiedfromtheir
extreme clinicopathologic characteristics alone and vali-
dated simple models using tumor grade, ER, PR, Ki67, and
HER2 status that accurately estimate the 21-GA low- and high-
risk classifications.15,16 Furthermore, they argue that testing
only a subset of patients with intermediary clinicopathologic
features is cost-efficient, albeit in this group the 21-GA has
shown the weakest predictive power. A recent impact study
of 74 334 patients with breast cancer and a 21-GA result found
that the positive predictive value for CT administration in pa-
tients with intermediate risk was only 40.1%.17 In the present
trial, the initial decision to administer CT based on the 21-GA
result was highly correlated with a high Ki67 expression of at
least 14% (Yates χ2 test, P = .01) (eTable 3 in the Supplement),
indicating that physicians reverted to traditional clinicopatho-
logic features to guide treatment decisions in patients with in-
termediate risk.

 ceiving results of the 70-GS when the 21-GA yielded an inter-
mediate RS, indicating a limitation of the latter assay in guiding
adjuvant treatment recommendations. The MINDACT trial
showed that patients classified at low risk by the 70-GS index
whobelongedtoasubsetwithER-positive,HER2-negative,and
LN-negative disease (744 [88.6%] of PROMIS patients) had a
5-year distant metastasis–free interval of 97.8% with no adju-
vant CT.2 This risk is sufficiently low to forgo adjuvant CT ow-
ing to the negligible absolute benefit in this population. Pa-
tients classified as low risk by the 70-GS from the Microarray
Prognostics in Breast Cancer (RASTER) trial had a distant re-
currence–free interval of 97.0% at 5 years (15% received CT).18
In addition, in the prospective, randomized Stockholm
Tamoxifen (STO-3) trial, 70-GS low-risk patients who re-
ceived only 2 or 5 years of tamoxifen had a 10-year distant me-
tastasis–free survival of 93% and a 20-year breast cancer–
specific survival of 90%.19,20 Alternately, in 70-GS high-risk
patients, adjuvant CT could be considered to optimize their
disease-specificoutcomes.IntheMINDACTstudy,70-GShigh-
risk patients from the same subgroup had a 94.6% distant me-
tastasis–free interval at 5 years with adjuvant CT, whereas un-
treated 70-GS high-risk patients in the earlier prognostic
validation studies had a probability of distant recurrence of
71%.21,22 Endocrine therapy alone was unlikely to account for
the total risk reduction observed in this high-risk group.
Limitations
Recurrence and survival data were not collected as part of this
studybecausetheprimaryobjectivewastoevaluatethechange
in treatment decision based on the information provided by
the 70-GS. The inclusion criteria for the PROMIS trial limited
eligible patients to those with ER-positive, HER2-negative dis-
ease and the published intermediate-range RS of 18 to 30, not
the TAILORx intermediate RS of 11 to 25. Of interest, the de-
cision to change treatment based on the 70-GS was signifi-
cant (McNemar P ≤ .001) regardless of whether the patient
would have been considered at high or intermediate risk by the
RS cutoff of at least 26 (eTable 4 in the Supplement).
Conclusions
The purpose of a prognostic test is to provide physicians
and patients with definitive and actionable information in
combination with other factors for accurate risk assessment.
The PROMIS trial observed that treatment recommendations
based on the 70-GS or 21-GA were often discordant and that
75.8%ofthesepatientschangedtheirtreatmentregimen.Over-
all, the additional information from the 70-GS results was as-
sociated with a change in the physician’
s adjuvant therapy rec-
ommendationfor33.6%ofallpatients,andphysiciansfollowed
the adjuvant therapy recommendation based on the 70-GS re-
sult for 748 patients (89.0%). The high proportion of cases in
which physicians changed their treatment regimens by add-
ingandremovingCT,alongwithaself-reportedincreaseincon-
fidence, substantiates the influence of the 70-GS test when
used for adjuvant decision making. Furthermore, obtaining
additional molecular testing in cases with ambiguity may im-
prove confidence in the adjuvant treatment plan. Accurately
identifying patients who can safely forego CT prevents pa-
tients from undergoing a treatment that may minimally ben-
efit them, sparing them from acute and long-term adverse ef-
fects, and would reduce the cost of health care for patients and
payers.23-25 Judicious use of genomic testing aids physicians
in tailoring the episode of care to appropriate patient popula-
tions, both maximizing the value of and minimizing the risk
for treatments. Although the recommendation to de-escalate
therapy has proven to be one of the most difficult challenges
in breast oncology, this study reveals that the 70-GS may pro-
vide physicians with clinically actionable information and im-
prove their confidence in de-escalating therapy.
