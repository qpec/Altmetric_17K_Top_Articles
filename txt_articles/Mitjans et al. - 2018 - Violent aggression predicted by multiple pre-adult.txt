Abstract
Early exposure to negative environmental impact shapes individual behavior and potentially contributes to any mental disease.
We reported previously that accumulated environmental risk markedly decreases age at schizophrenia onset. Follow-up of
matched extreme group individuals (≤1 vs. ≥3 risks) unexpectedly revealed that high-risk subjects had >5 times greater
probability of forensic hospitalization. In line with longstanding sociological theories, we hypothesized that risk accumulation
before adulthood induces violent aggression and criminal conduct, independent of mental illness. We determined in 6
independent cohorts (4 schizophrenia and 2 general population samples) pre-adult risk exposure, comprising urbanicity,
migration, physical and sexual abuse as primary, and cannabis or alcohol as secondary hits. All single hits by themselves were
marginally associated with higher violent aggression. Most strikingly, however, their accumulation strongly predicted violent
aggression (odds ratio 10.5). An epigenome-wide association scan to detect differential methylation of blood-derived DNA of
selected extreme group individuals yielded overall negative results. Conversely, determination in peripheral blood mononuclear
cells of histone-deacetylase1 mRNA as ‘umbrella mediator’ of epigenetic processes revealed an increase in the high-risk group,
suggesting lasting epigenetic alterations. Together, we provide sound evidence of a disease-independent unfortunate
relationship between well-defined pre-adult environmental hits and violent aggression, calling for more efficient prevention.
Introduction
Early exposure to external risk factors like childhood mal-
treatment, sexual abuse or head trauma, but also living in
urban environment or migration from other countries and
cultures, have long been known or suspected to exert
adverse
effects
on
individual
development
and
socioeconomic functioning. Moreover, these environmental
risk factors seem to contribute to abnormal behavior and to
severity and onset of mental illness [1–11], even though
different risk factors may have different impact, dependent
on the particular neuropsychiatric disease in focus. On top
of these ‘primary’ factors, that are rather inevitable for the
affected, ‘secondary’, avoidable risks add to the negative
individual and societal outcome, namely cannabis and
alcohol abuse [1, 11–16].
Adverse experiences in adulthood, like exposure to
violence, traumatic brain injury, or substance intoxication,
can act as single triggers to increase the short-term risk of
violence in mentally ill individuals as much as in control
subjects
[16,
17].
However,
comprehensive
studies,
including large numbers of individuals and replication
cohorts, on pre-adult accumulation of environmental risk
factors and their long-term consequences on human beha-
vior do not exist. In a recent report, we showed that

 accumulation of environmental risks leads to a nearly 10-
year earlier schizophrenia onset, demonstrating the sub-
stantial impact of the environment on mental disease, which
by far outlasted any common genetic effects [18]. To search
for epigenetic signatures in blood of carefully matched
extreme group subjects of this previous study (with ≤1 vs.
≥3 risk factors) we had to re-contact them. This re-contact
led to the unforeseen observation that high-risk subjects
had > 5 times higher probability to be hospitalized in for-
ensic units compared to low-risk subjects.
This finding stimulated the present work: Having the
longstanding concepts of sociologists and criminologists in
mind, we hypothesized that early accumulation of envir-
onmental risk factors would lead to increased violent
aggression and social rule-breaking in affected individuals,
independent
of
any
mental
illness.
To
test
this
hypothesis,
we
explored
environmental
risk
before
the age of 18 years in 4 schizophrenia samples of the
GRAS (Göttingen Research Association for Schizophrenia)
data collection [19, 20]. Likewise, risk factors were
assessed as available in 2 general population samples. In all
cohorts,
accumulation
of
pre-adult
environmental
hits was highly significantly associated with lifetime con-
viction for violent acts or high psychopathy and aggression-
hostility scores as proxies of violent aggression and rule-
breaking. As a first small hint of epigenetic alterations in
our
high-risk
subjects,
histone-deacetylase1
(HDAC1)
mRNA was found increased in peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells (PBMC).
Methods
Subjects
Schizophrenia
Ethics Committees of Georg-August-University, Göttingen,
and participating centers across Germany approved the
GRAS study, complying with the Helsinki Declaration. All
patients (and/or legal representatives) gave written informed
consent. GRAS data collection-I (2005–2010) [19, 20] and
-II (2013–2016) consist of schizophrenic and schizoaffec-
tive subjects, assigned to: (1) male discovery sample (N =
134 extreme group individuals with ≤1 or ≥3 risk factors,
selected/matched from our previous study [18]); (2) male
GRAS-I (N = 606); (3) male GRAS-II (N = 320); (4)
female GRAS-I and -II cohorts (N = 503).
General population
Replication samples IV (N = 336) and V (N = 229) consist
of
individuals
from
the
Spanish
general
population,
recruited from the Jaume I University in Castelló and drawn
from the third wave of an ongoing follow-up study
which
recruited
students
from
a
variety
of
urban
and rural, public and private high schools from Castelló.
Ethical approval was obtained from University Ethics
Committees; participants provided written informed consent
[21, 22].
Sociodemographic and disease-related parameters
The GRAS data collection contains comprehensive infor-
mation regarding sociodemographic and disease-related
parameters, acquired through detailed examination, semi-
structured
interviews,
telephone
consultations,
ques-
tionnaires, and complete collection of hospitalization letters,
allowing meticulous double-checking of patients’ self-
reports [19, 20]. Chlorpromazine equivalents as indi-
cator of present medication/disease severity and past sui-
cide attempts as measure of severe self-aggression were
employed for sample characterization and group compar-
ison. Premorbid intelligence was estimated using MWT-B
(Mehrfachwahl-Wortschatz-Intelligenztest-B), and for cur-
rent cognitive symptoms, a cognitive composite score was
calculated,
based
on
reasoning
(Leistungsprüfsystem-
subtest-3), executive function (Trail-Making-B) and verbal
learning and memory (VLMT) [18, 19].
Environmental risk exposure
Schizophrenia subjects
Specific information was derived from history-taking and
semi-structured interviews with patients and relatives/care-
takers (GRAS-Manual) [19, 20] and from SCID-I. Each
patient was dichotomously classified as having/not having
been exposed premorbid and until age 18 years to severe
physical abuse (comprising unpredictability of violence,
injury due to physical reprimand or objects for corporal
punishment),
sexual
abuse
(forced
touches,
kissing,
attempted or real rape), migration (subjects immigrating to
Germany), neurotrauma (traumatic brain injury of all
severity
grades), perinatal complications
(pregnancy,
delivery, early postnatal life), any cannabis consumption
and alcohol abuse [23]. To operationalize urbanicity until
age 18, information on place of residence and relocation
was collected from discharge letters, social history, tele-
phone interviews/return mail (questionnaire). Total urbani-
city score was dichotomously divided into rural vs. urban
residence [18]. In case of contradictory or missing infor-
mation, patients were excluded from respective analyses.
Single risk factors with highest impact over all samples
were accumulated to investigate combined influence on
aggression.
M. Mitjans et al.
 General population subjects
Physical and sexual abuse was assessed by the shortened
version of Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) [24]
and dichotomously recorded (never/any), as was migration
(not born in Spain), alcohol (Alcohol Use Disorders Iden-
tification Test - AUDIT ≥ 4) [25] and any cannabis con-
sumption.
Data
regarding
perinatal
complications,
neurotrauma and urbanicity were unavailable.
Measures of violent aggression and criminal
conduct
Schizophrenia subjects
History of forensic hospitalization or conviction for bat-
tery, sexual assault, manslaughter, murder (at least once in
life time) was used as violent aggression proxy. For cross-
validation of this dichotomous variable, a continuous
measure, the violent aggression severity score (VASS),
based on questionnaires, interviews and charts, was gener-
ated and applied to the discovery sample. The VASS in turn
was cross-validated by an intra-sample ranking of relative
aggression severity by 2 independent raters (Fig. 1).
General population subjects
Secondary psychopathy of the Levenson Self-Report Psy-
chopathy Scale (LSRP) [26], measuring antisocial aspects of
psychopathy (rule-breaking; lack of effort towards socially
rewarded behavior), and aggression-hostility factor of the
Zuckerman–Kuhlman Personality Questionnaire, shortened
form (ZKPQ-50-CC) [27], were used as proxies of violent
aggression.
Statistical analysis of environmental risk
Group differences for continuous variables were assessed
using Mann-Whitney-U or Kruskal-Wallis-H test for com-
parison of > 2 groups. Frequency differences between
groups were assessed using χ2-test or Fisher’s exact test. As
trend tests, Jonckheere-Terpstra or Cochran-Armitage tests
were applied. Covariates are explained in display items.
Bonferroni correction accounted for multiple testing (p
values withstanding correction denoted). Statistical analyses
were performed using SPSS (v17.0; IBM-Deutschland
GmbH, Munich, Germany), or R (v3.3.2; R-Foundation
for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Methylation Array
Whole blood-derived DNA of extreme group individuals
(N = 134) was analyzed by Infinium-HumanMethylation450K
(Illumina Inc, CA, USA). Raw intensity data was pre-
processed and SWAN (Subset-quantile Within Array Nor-
malization) performed using Bioconductor package Minfi
(v1.18.6) [28]. Probes with annotated single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in CpG site or at single base
extension sites were removed, leaving 467,971 probes total.
To identify differentially methylated positions, a linear
regression model using limma (v3.28.17) Bioconductor
package [29] was fit. Covariates were age, medication and
estimated cell proportions (monocytes, granulocytes, CD4T,
CD8T, natural killer, and B-cells), calculated using Cell
Counts Function in Minfi package [30]. A total of N = 129
individuals were finally included for the analyses since two
samples were dropped based on separate clustering in prin-
cipal component analysis and information regarding medi-
cation was not available for three samples. All analyses were
performed in R.
PBMC isolation and HDAC1 assay
PBMC were isolated from morning blood, collected into
CPDA-vials
(Citrate-Phosphate-Dextrose-Adenine,
Sar-
stedt, Germany), applying standard Ficoll-Paque-Plus iso-
lation (GE-Healthcare, Munich, Germany). Total RNA
extraction was done using miRNeasy Mini-kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). For reverse transcription, 200ng RNA
was applied using a mixture of oligo(dT)/hexamers, dNTPs,
DTT and 200U SuperscriptIII (Life Technologies GmbH,
Darmstadt, Germany). HDAC1 expression was measured
using quantitative real-time PCR. The cDNA was diluted
1:12.5 in 10 µl reaction-mix, containing 5 µl of SYBR-green
(Life Technologies) and 1pmol/primer:
HDAC1-Fw: 5′-AAATTCTTGCGCTCCATCCG-3′
HDAC1-Rv: 5′-CAGGCCATCGAATACTGGACA-3′
GAPDH-Fw: 5′-CTGACTTCAACAGCGACACC-3′
GAPDH-Rv: 5′-TGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTGT-3′
Technical
triplicates
were
run
on
LightCycler480
(Roche-Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). Rela-
tive HDAC1 expression was calculated by the threshold-
cycle method (LightCycler480 Software1.5.0SP3-Roche)
and normalization to the housekeeping gene GAPDH was
performed. After examination for outliers, Student’s t test
was used to compare groups using Prism4 (GraphPad-
Software; San Diego, CA, USA).
Results
The environmental risk factors evaluated in this study
comprise urbanicity, migration, perinatal complications,
physical maltreatment, sexual abuse, traumatic brain injury,
cannabis consumption and alcohol abuse. Contacting male
extreme group subjects of GRAS (with low vs. high

 environmental risk before age 18; discovery sample; N =
134) [18] for a planned epigenetic follow-up, we found 27%
of high-risk individuals in forensic units in contrast to only
6% of low-risk subjects (p < 0.001; χ2-test, two-sided). This
finding was replicated in the remaining GRAS-I sample
(GRAS-I males and females minus extreme group subjects),
where a stepwise increase in lifetime prevalence of forensic
hospitalization was seen upon risk accumulation (Fig. 1a).
This observation made us wonder whether we would find
a strong intercorrelation between the here investigated
environmental risks. To test for multicollinearity between
the risk factors included in the accumulation models, we
calculated the variance inflation factor (VIF) for each
sample. Our results suggest that none of the included factors
significantly collinears with any other (for each sample
VIF ≤ 1.28), allowing us to include them in our models.
We hypothesized that forensic hospitalization reflects
violent aggression. To quantify this trait, and in absence of
established instruments for comprehensive retrospective
analysis of violent aggression, we generated the VASS

forensic hospitalization in the discovery sample (see results) suggested
a substantial impact of environmental risk accumulation on violent
aggression, a finding replicated in the remaining GRAS sample

 (Fig. 1b). Information for VASS was extracted for all dis-
covery individuals (N = 134) from detailed history, avail-
able in the GRAS database [19, 20], and additional
extensive chart study based on original medical documents
over lifetime. VASS ranges from no documented aggression
to lethal consequences of violent aggression. Relative
weight is given to severity of aggression and number of
registered re-occurrences. For first cross-validation of this
new tool, an intra-sample expert ranking of relative
aggression severity in the discovery sample was performed
by 2 independent psychologists (unaware of environmental
risk status of subjects under study), yielding Spearman’s
rho = 0.97 for interrater reliability and rho = 0.96 for
intercorrelation with VASS (Fig. 1c). Inspection of VASS
values in the discovery sample upon risk accumulation
again demonstrates the ‘stair pattern’ (Fig. 1d).
Since not all information was available as detailed for the
schizophrenia replication samples of GRAS-I and -II as for
the
discovery
sample,
we introduced
a dichotomous
aggression proxy, including history of forensic hospitali-
zation and/or conviction for battery, sexual assault, man-
slaughter
or
murder
(at
least
once
in
lifetime).
Intercorrelation with VASS and expert ranking, respectively,
resulted in rpb = 0.63 (point-biserial) and rrb = 0.62 (rank-
biserial) (Fig. 1c). Applying this proxy to replication sam-
ples I-III (GRAS-I males without discovery sample, GRAS-
II males, GRAS-I&II females), consistently yielded the
‘stair pattern’ upon risk accumulation, even though at
slightly lower level in females (Fig. 1e–g). The percentage
of subjects with documented aggression increases with the
number of risk factors, strikingly similar in all schizo-
phrenia cohorts (Fig. 1h). Important for future preventive
measures in at-risk subjects is the observation that a single
risk factor (independent of its kind) is still compensated for
(Fig. 1h). When comparing subjects with 0 vs. ≥3 envir-
onmental factors over all schizophrenia samples, the odds
ratio for violent aggression (based on aggression proxy)
amounts to 10.5. Details on sociodemographic and disease-
related variables, as well as on the various highly inter-
correlating measures of violent aggression in the environ-
mental
risk
accumulation
groups
in
discovery
and
replication samples are given in Tables 1 and 2. Whereas no
consistent differences in premorbid intelligence, present
cognition
(cognitive
composite),
and
chlorpromazine
equivalents (relative amount of antipsychotics) emerge
among groups, age tends to be lower and suicidality to
occur more frequently with increasing pre-adult environ-
mental risk exposure in the schizophrenia cohorts, which is
not unexpected considering our previous report [18]
(Table 1). A remarkable increase in all available measures
of violent aggression becomes obvious upon accumulation
of environmental risk (final model consisting of urbanicity,
migration,
physical
and
sexual
abuse,
alcohol
and
cannabis), reflected by highly significant p values in group
and trend statistics throughout samples (Table 2).
For analyzing onset of aggressive behavior, the extensive
information on aggression available in the discovery sample
was exploited. Early aggression (any aggression docu-
mented before age 18 years and well before schizophrenia
onset) clearly increased upon ≥2 risk factors, whereas
aggression seen only later in life seemed independent of
early environmental risk (Fig. 1i). Therefore, we hypothe-
sized that violent aggression upon risk accumulation may be
unrelated to mental disease.
To test this hypothesis, we had the chance to analyze 2
well-characterized independent samples (replication IV and
V; Tables 1 and 2) of young individuals from the Spanish
general population. Since data on criminal conduct could
not be obtained in these cohorts, we had to use alternative,
psychometrically
validated
instruments
as
aggression
proxies, namely LSRP secondary psychopathy score [26],
measuring rule-breaking and lack of effort towards socially
rewarded behavior, and the aggression-hostility factor of
ZKPQ-50-CC [27]. Urbanicity as risk factor was unavail-
able in these samples (reducing the model to 5 of the 6 risk
factors explored in schizophrenia, that is migration, physical
maltreatment, sexual abuse, alcohol and cannabis). We also
note that subjects were younger and as academics probably
higher educated as compared to the disease cohorts. Despite
these mitigating facts, and despite employing individuals of
another country, the expected ‘stair pattern’ still emerged
clearly for both proxies, likely suggesting generalizability of
these findings (Fig. 1j,k; Tables 1 and 2). Data given here
for the general population samples (replications IV and V)
are based on both males and females. In addition, evaluating
men and women separately (taking both general population
cohorts together) yielded significant results for both genders
(Table 2 bottom).
Addressing the composition of risk factors among groups
across cohorts, we obtained a comparable pattern through-
out schizophrenia samples (stacked-charts; Fig. 1a,d-g). In
the general population subjects, particularly alcohol and
cannabis consumption (classified as ‘secondary hits’) pre-
dominated (Fig. 1j,k) which also seem to play an appreci-
able role in schizophrenia cohorts. Therefore, we wondered
whether separate analysis of risk accumulation, integrating
only primary vs. only secondary hits, would still result in
significant effects on aggression. For all schizophrenia
samples individually, group difference and trend remained
highly significant (not shown). Taking all schizophrenia
subjects together (N > 1200), the aggression proxy yields
for the accumulation model, built on primary risks only
(urbanicity, migration, physical and sexual abuse), p =
4.5 × 10−17 (χ2 = 75.28) and p < 2.2 × 10−16 (χ2 = 68.28),
for group differences and trend, respectively. The corre-

Violent aggression predicted by multiple pre-adult environmental hits
 cannabis) in schizophrenia are p = 6.6 × 10−19 (χ2 = 83.71)
and p < 2.2 × 10−16 (χ2 = 83.40). Analogously, taking all
general population subjects together (N > 530), we obtain
for LSRP with primary risks (urbanicity not available) p =
0.002 (H = 12.65) and p = 0.0003 (J = 33774.5), and with
secondary risks p = 1.3 × 10−4 (H = 17.92) and p = 5.3 ×
10−5 (J = 42412.5) for group differences and trend. Also
here, significance was already reached with separate ana-
lysis of both cohorts (not shown).
For deciding on the accumulation model, we had initially
screened all individual risk factors of our ‘primary plus
secondary risk factor model’ separately in both schizo-
phrenia and general population cohorts to get an estimation
of their relative impact (Tables 3a,3b,3c). Perinatal com-
plications and neurotrauma before the age of 18 years were
unavailable for general population subjects. Since these
risks showed the lowest overall impact on aggression
proxies in schizophrenia, we decided not to include them in
our present accumulation model.
Finally, we performed an epigenome-wide association
scan to detect differential methylation of blood-derived
DNA of selected extreme group individuals (discovery
sample; N = 134; Fig. 1a), originally planned as epigenetic
follow-up study [18]. This scan turned out to be negative. In
fact, contrasting subjects either with high vs. low number of
environmental hits or according to VASS median split
yielded a single methylation difference upon lowering the
Bonferroni threshold to 10−6 (Table 4). Similarly, when
looking in an exploratory fashion (small/unbalanced group
sizes) at individual risk factors separately, results were
essentially negative (Table 4). Hits associated with migra-
tion were likely related to ethnicity rather than environ-
mental risk, as reported recently [31]. The power of our
sample size - even though in the range of suggestions [32]
and despite extreme group comparison - may not have been
sufficient to detect differences, also due to a vast underlying
heterogeneity of individual methylation sites. Even the
search for methylation differences of aggression-related
candidate genes [33–35] turned out negative (not shown),
putting the relative weight of phenotypical consequences
(here violent aggression) vs. common methylation results in
humans into perspective. In contrast, determining HDAC1
mRNA levels in PBMC available from male extreme group
subjects (≤1 vs. ≥3 risks) revealed a highly significant dif-
ference (p = 0.001), with higher levels in the high-risk (N
= 33) compared to the low-risk group (N = 109) (Fig. 1l).
This transcript encodes an enzyme of the histone deacety-
lase complex which serves as an overarching regulator of
epigenetic processes. Indeed, peripheral HDAC1 mRNA
levels seem to be a more robust readout of epigenetic
modifications in small sample sizes [36] as compared to
specific methylation sites in the epigenome-wide associa-
tion scan, and suggest lasting epigenetic alterations.
Discussion
The present work was initiated based on the observation in a
schizophrenia cohort that accumulation of environmental
risk factors before adulthood promotes the likelihood of
later forensic hospitalization, interpreted as indicator of
violent aggression. This interpretation and the effect of risk
accumulation were consolidated using direct scoring of
aggression over lifetime or, as aggression proxies, forensic
hospitalization and conviction for battery, sexual assault,
manslaughter or murder, or respective psychopathology
measures in 4 independent schizophrenia cohorts and 2
general population samples. Importantly, our data support
the concept of a disease-independent development of vio-
lent aggression in subjects exposed to multiple pre-adult
environmental risk factors.
Whereas a vast amount of literature on single environ-
mental risk factors reports consequences for abnormal
behavior and mental illness, publications on pre-adult risk
accumulation are scarce and mostly based on closely
interrelated social/familial risk factors. Also, risk and con-
sequence are often not clearly defined. Studies including
larger, comprehensively characterized datasets and replica-
tion samples do not exist. The present work is the first to
provide sound evidence, based on 6 separate cohorts, of a
disease-independent relationship between accumulation of
multifaceted
pre-adult
environmental
hits
and
violent
aggression. The overall societal damage is enormous, and
we note that mentally ill individuals who re-enter the
community from prison are even more at risk for unem-
ployment, homelessness, and criminal recidivism [37].
These results should encourage better precautionary mea-
sures, including intensified research on protective factors
which is still underrepresented [2, 38–40].
In the psychosociological literature, the so-called exter-
nalizing
behavior
in
childhood
includes
hostile
and
aggressive physical behavior toward others, impulsivity,
hyperactivity,
and
noncompliance
with
limit-setting
[41, 42]. The respective risk factors are all highly plau-
sible, yet often theoretical, and derived from 4 broad
domains: child risk factors (e.g., adverse temperament,
genetic and gender risk), sociocultural risks (e.g., poverty,
stressful life events), parenting and caregiving (e.g., conflict
and violence at home, physical abuse), and children’s peer
experiences (e.g., instable relationships, social rejection). A
full model of the development of conduct problems has
been suggested to include at least these 4 domains [41, 43,
44]. The risk factors analyzed in the present study are
perhaps somewhat clearer defined but partially related to
and overlapping across these domains. Urbanicity, migra-
tion, cannabis and alcohol reflect sociocultural input but
also peer experience, and physical or sexual abuse belong to
the parenting/caregiver aspect.

 Certainly, there are many more, still undiscovered risk
and numerous protective factors, potentially explaining why
‘only’ 40–50% of high-risk individuals in our schizophrenia
samples fulfill criteria of violent aggression. We note that
this study does not include genetic data analysis or cor-
rection for any genetic impact. The genetic influence on
aggression, however, may be of considerable relevance for
the individual [45–49], even though highly heterogeneous
as for essentially all behavioral traits. Heritability of
aggression, estimated from twin studies, reaches > 60%
[50, 51]. In fact, 50% of individuals with violent aggression
upon pre-adult risk accumulation in the present study
means another 50% without detectable aggression. This
consistent finding across samples likely indicates that
genetic predisposition is prerequisite for whichever beha-
vioral consequence. Individuals without genetic predis-
position and/or with more protective factors (genetic and
environmental) may not react with violent aggression to
accumulated environmental risk. Importantly, the obvious
gender effect may be a matter of degree rather than of
pattern. In fact, the etiology of externalizing behavior pro-
blems is similar for girls and boys [41, 52], as is the con-
sequence of risk accumulation in the present study for males
and females.
The risk factors of the sociological domains seem to be
stable predictors over time, to some degree interchangeable,
pointing to many pathways leading to the same outcome
(principle of equifinality) [41]. The interchangeability is
highly interesting also with respect to potential biological
mechanisms. It appears that any of the here investigated hits
alone, independent of its kind, can be compensated for but
that higher risk load increases the probability of violent
aggression. Also for that reason, we are weighing risk fators
equally in the present study. This could theoretically create
some bias. However, to be able to estimate the true effect
size of each specific factor separately on violent aggression
and subsequently weigh all factors in a more proper way,
much larger samples sizes would be needed that are pre-
sently not available anywhere in the world.
In contrast to the marginal influence of genome-wide
association data on mental disease in GRAS [18, 53], the
accumulated environmental impact on development of
violent aggression is huge, reflected by odds ratios of > 10.
When striking at a vulnerable time of brain development,
namely around/before puberty, the environmental input may
‘non-specifically’ affect any predisposed individual. The
hypothetical biological mechanisms underlying this accu-
mulation effect in humans may range from alterations in
neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter systems, neuronal/
synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis to changes in the
adaptive immune system and interference with develop-
mental myelination, affecting brain connectivity and net-
work function [9, 10, 54, 55].
Our approach to detect methylation changes in blood
using an epigenome-wide association scan was unsuccess-
ful despite matched extreme group comparison, likely due
to the small sample size (although in the suggested range
[32]), and perhaps the etiological/pathogenetic complexity
of accumulated risks. Changes in brain, not accessible here
for analysis, can certainly not be excluded. Interestingly,
however, HDAC1 mRNA levels in PBMC of male extreme
group subjects were increased in the high-risk compared to
the low-risk group. This finding confirms peripheral
HDAC1 mRNA levels as a more robust readout of epige-
netic alterations in relatively small sample sizes [36], as
compared to specific methylation sites in epigenome-wide
association scans or even in candidate genes. To gain fur-
ther mechanistic insight and thereby develop - in addition to
prevention measures - novel individualized treatment con-
cepts [36], animal studies modeling risk accumulation seem
unavoidable.
To conclude, this study should motivate sociopolitical
actions,
aiming
at
identifying
individuals-at-risk
and
improving precautionary measures. Effective violence pre-
vention strategies start early and include family-focused and
school-based programs [2, 16, 38]. Additional risk factors,
interchangeable in their long-term consequences, like
urbanicity, migration, and substance abuse, should be
increasingly considered. Health care providers are essential
for all of these prevention concepts. More research on
protective factors and resilience should be launched. Ani-
mal studies need to be supported that model risk accumu-
lation for mechanistic insight into brain alterations leading
to aggression, and for developing new treatment approa-
ches, also those targeting reversal of epigenetic alterations.
As a novel concept, scientific efforts on ‘phenotyping of the
environment’ [11] should be promoted to achieve more
fundamental risk estimation and more effective prevention
in the future.
