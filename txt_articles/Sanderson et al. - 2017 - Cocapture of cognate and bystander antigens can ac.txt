Autoantibodies against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)
are associated with autoimmune central nervous system diseases like
acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). For ADEM, it is specu-
lated that a preceding infection is the trigger of the autoimmune
response, but the mechanism connecting the infection to the produc-
tion of MOG antibodies remains a mystery. We reasoned that the
ability of B cells to capture cognate antigen from cell membranes,
along with small quantities of coexpressed “bystander” antigens,
might enable B-cell escape from tolerance. We tested this hypothesis
using influenza hemagglutinin as a model viral antigen and transgenic,
MOG-specific B cells. Using flow cytometry and live and fixed cell
microscopy, we show that MOG-specific B cells take up large amounts
of MOG from cell membranes. Uptake of the antigen from the mem-
brane leads to a strong activation of the capturing B cell. When influ-
enza hemagglutinin is also present in the membrane of the target cell,
it can be cocaptured with MOG by MOG-specific B cells via the B-cell
receptor. Hemagglutinin and MOG are both presented to T cells,
which in turn are activated and proliferate. As a consequence,
MOG-specific B cells get help from hemagglutinin-specific T cells to
produce anti-MOG antibodies. In vivo, the transfer of MOG-specific B
cells into recipient mice after the cocapture of MOG and hemagglu-
tinin leads to the production of class-switched anti-MOG antibodies,
dependent on the presence of hemagglutinin-specific T cells. This
mechanism offers a link between infection and autoimmunity.

A
n association between infections and autoimmunity has long
been observed in clinical practice. Examples of this association
are the onset of Guillain–Barré syndrome after intestinal Cam-
pylobacter infections and acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis
(ADEM) following respiratory infections. Possible explanations for
this connection between autoimmunity and infection include mo-
lecular mimicry between the infectious agent and the autoantigen
and bystander activation of preexisting autoreactive immune cells.
Although the molecular mimicry hypothesis is well supported for
Guillain–Barré syndrome (1), the mechanisms leading to autoim-
munity in other diseases are not understood. Among the most im-
portant suspected viral triggers of ADEM is influenza virus infection
(2). It is also known that pediatric patients with ADEM especially
mount a humoral immune response against myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG) (3). The mechnism through which the viral
infection leads to the production of autoantibodies is unknown.
An important checkpoint for the avoidance of autoantibody
production is the destruction of autoreactive B cells in the bone
marrow (4). Unlike the case of T-cell selection in the thymus,
where the transcriptional regulator AIRE ensures the expression of
otherwise tissue-specific antigens (5), the set of antigens expressed
in the bone marrow is limited, meaning that B cells whose Ig an-
tigen receptors (B-cell receptor, BCR) recognize self-antigens re-
stricted to other tissues can escape this selection and populate the
periphery. Normally this does not lead to autoimmunity, because
active production of antibodies requires T-cell help (6). This takes
place in secondary lymphoid organs and involves extensive physical
contact with a helper T-cell whose antigen receptor (T-cell re-
ceptor, TCR) recognizes a peptide displayed on the B cell’s major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Efficient
negative T-cell selection in the thymus therefore also safeguards
against the production of autoantibodies. If a B cell that recognizes
a self-antigen is artificially enabled to obtain T-cell help, for ex-
ample by immunization with the self-antigen covalently linked to
an immunogenic foreign protein antigen, class-switched antibodies
against the self-antigen can be produced (7).
We hypothesized that breakdown of B-cell tolerance is initiated
by the simultaneous uptake of an autoantigen and a viral antigen
by B cells from infected parenchymal cells. Antigen capture from
cell membranes differs significantly from capture of soluble anti-
gen: Membrane-bound antigens are multivalent, increasing the
binding avidity in comparison with a monovalent antigen in so-
lution (8); moreover, membrane-bound antigens exist in associa-
tion with other protein and lipid components of the membrane, so
that sometimes these bystander molecules can be cocaptured with
the cognate antigen (9). We speculated that if such bystander
antigens were processed and presented to T cells, it would cir-
cumvent the antigen specificity of T-cell help. Concretely, we hy-
pothesize that if an autoreactive B cell binds a cognate self-antigen
on the surface of a virus-infected cell, it can capture both self and
neighboring viral antigens and, by presenting peptides from the
viral antigen, can obtain T-cell help from antiviral T cells, leading
to the production of antibodies against the self-antigen.
Significance
The immune system normally produces antibodies against path-
ogens and avoids making antibodies against self-proteins. In some
individuals, antibodies against self-proteins (autoantibodies) are
made and can cause debilitating disease, but the reasons for this
failure of self-tolerance are not known. The experiments de-
scribed test the following hypothesis linking viral infections and
production of autoantibodies: A B cell whose immunoglobulin
receptor recognizes a self-membrane protein can capture that
protein from the membrane of a virus-infected cell and simulta-
neously cocapture viral proteins; fragments of the viral protein
can then be presented to antiviral T cells and qualify for the
positive signals for proliferation and antibody production known
as T-cell help. We observed this phenomenon in vitro and in vivo.

 We tested this hypothesis using adherent cells that express the
CNS-restricted membrane protein MOG as a model self-antigen,
influenza hemagglutinin (HA) as a model viral antigen, and
transgenic mouse B and T cells specific for each antigen.
Results
Capture of Cognate Antigen from Membrane Is Rapid and Robust.
Capture of cognate antigen from membrane has been examined in
molecular detail (10, 11), generally using isolated membrane prep-
arations. We examined the capture of cognate antigen from mem-
branes of live cells by IgHMOG transgenic B cells, whose BCR
recognizes the extracellular domain of MOG (12). When IgHMOG B
cells were exposed to adherent HEK cells that express a MOG-GFP
fusion, GFP capture was detected in the B cells by flow cytometry as
soon as 1 min after contact and continued to increase for more than
1 h (Fig. 1 A–C and Movie S1). Capture was paralleled by loss of
surface IgM, indicating internalization of the BCR–antigen complex
(Fig. 1 A and B). Immunolabeling of cocultures showed that cap-
tured antigen and IgM associate with LAMP1-immunoreactive
structures within the B cell, presumably lysosomes (Fig. 1 D and E).
Initially these structures are seen only at the interface of B cell and
antigen-expressing HEK cell (Movie S2), but upon prolonged in-
teraction, they distribute throughout the B cell (Fig. 1 D and E and
Movie S3). After extended interaction, the majority of the Ig
colocalizes with antigen (Movie S3).
Membrane Antigen Capture Renders B Cells Highly Antigenic for T Cells.
We exposed IgHMOG B cells for 8, 12, or 20 h to adherent TE cells
that express MOG (TE MOG) and examined expression of acti-
vation markers by flow cytometry. TE cells are more strongly
adherent than HEK cells, facilitating their separation from B cells,
but less efficiently transfected. In our hands, the type of antigen-
presenting cell has no obvious influence on B-cell antigen capture.
We compared these membrane antigen-capturing B cells with
identical B cells exposed to non–antigen-expressing TE cells or to
soluble MOG protein or to an IgM-crosslinking antibody. Loss of
surface IgM was similar for B cells exposed to soluble or mem-
brane-expressed antigen, but up-regulation of the activation mark-
ers CD69 and CD25 was far greater on the B cells exposed to
membrane antigen (Fig. 2A). Up-regulation of class II MHC and
CD86 was similar for the three kinds of BCR stimulation (Fig. 2A).
Elevated class II expression was maintained longer after membrane
capture than after other forms of BCR stimulation, but this effect
was not statistically significant at the time points studied.
We next examined the presentation of captured membrane anti-
gens to T cells by coculturing IgHMOG B cells (MHC class II allotype
I-Ab) with TE MOG cells and then retrieving and coculturing them
with 2D2 T cells, which recognize MOG 35–55 in the context of I-Ab
(13). The 2D2 T cells exposed to IgHMOG B cells after membrane
capture proliferated more strongly than those cocultured with naive
B cells in the presence of a high concentration of cognate peptide
(Fig. 2 B and C). Soluble MOG protein was no more effective than
peptide (Fig. 2C). Neither B cells exposed to culture supernatants
from antigen-expressing cells nor to TE cells that did not express
antigen stimulated any proliferation. This rules out involvement of
secreted soluble antigen or antigen-independent properties of the
TE cells (Fig. 2C). Rather, it appears that the act of antigen capture
renders the capturing B cell highly stimulatory for T cells.
To test this interpretation, we assessed the stimulatory properties
of B cells after membrane capture of antigens that were irrelevant for
the responding T cell, with or without additional peptide that matches
the T-cell specifitiy. We exposed HA-specific FluBI B cells (I-Ab) to
TE cells stably transfected with HA (TE HA) and then retrieved and
cocultured these B cells with 2D2 T cells in the presence or absence

Capture of cognate antigen from membrane.
(A) Flow cytometry of MOG-GFP fusion protein acquisi-
tion and cell-surface IgM by either MOG-specific IgHMOG
or wild-type B cells. Primary splenic B cells were cocul-
tured with MOG-GFP–expressing HEK cells for the times
shown and then retrieved, labeled with anti-CD45R
(B220) and anti-IgM antibodies, and measured. Data
shown are gated on scatter and B220 immunofluores-
cence from one of three similar experiments (gating
strategy is shown in Fig. S1). Tick marks on axes show
log10 decades and are the same for all plots. (B) Graph-
ical representation of the GFP fluorescence (solid green
line) and IgM immunofluorescence (broken purple line)
intensities shown in A. For each of the two channels,
geometric mean fluorescence divided by its initial value
at time 0 is shown on a linear scale against time. Error
bars show SEM. (C) Single 28 × 40 μm frames from a live
cell imaging experiment showing the capture of MOG-
GFP (green) from stably transfected HEK cells by IgHMOG
B cells labeled with Cell Tracker Deep Red (magenta).
When the Top Left frame was captured, one B cell
(broken cyan arrow) was in contact with the HEK cell.
Three minutes later (Top Right), a second B cell had
made contact (cyan arrow) but has not yet obviously
captured antigen. In the subsequent frames at 15 and
45 min, the accumulations of antigen (cyan arrows in
lower frames) are visibly increasing. The entire time se-
quence is provided as Movie S1. (D) 3D reconstructions
of confocal z stacks of B cell–HEK MOG-GFP interactions.
B cells were fixed after 3 or 60 min of coculture with HEK
MOG-GFP cells and immunolabeled for LAMP1 (red) and
IgM (magenta) before laser scanning confocal micros-
copy. Stacks of XY planes were processed digitally to
generate 3D reconstructions and rotated to show the
view “from the side.” The broken white arrows on each
image show the level at which the planes shown in E
were captured. (Scale bar, 2 μm.) The 3D reconstructions are provided as Movies S2 and S3. (E) “Horizontal” (i.e., parallel with the coverglass) sections through the same two

IMMUNOLOGY AND
INFLAMMATION
 of exogenous MOG 35–55 peptide (Fig. 2D). Without additional
peptide, FluBI B cells stimulated no proliferation of 2D2 T cells,
whether or not the B cells had previously encountered HA. With
added peptide, even antigen-naive FluBI B cells stimulated T-cell
proliferation but much less than B cells that had been previously
activated by membrane HA capture (Fig. 2D). The enhanced ability
of B cells after membrane capture to stimulate T-cell proliferation
may thus be due to the high level of activation of B cells and the
concomitant increase in costimulatory ligands (Fig. 2A).
We also measured 2D2 T-cell proliferation in response to
MOG-specific B cells exposed to the same TE cells with or
without peptide (Fig. 2D). Again, preexposure to membrane-
expressed MOG rendered the B cells more stimulatory for the
T cells than pulsing with peptide, whereas the presence of HA
had no effect. Providing the antigen in a form recognizable by
the BCR—that is, soluble MOG 1–125 protein—resulted in only
slightly greater stimulation of T-cell proliferation than puls-
ing with MOG 35–55 peptide, and IgHMOG B cells were only
slightly better in inducing 2D2 proliferation after capture of MOG
1–125 protein compared with FluBI B cells, which must take up
the protein via a BCR-independent route. Most strikingly, FluBI
cells exposed to TE cells that express both HA and MOG stim-
ulated the proliferation of MOG-specific T cells, without the ad-
dition of exogenous MOG peptide. This implies that MOG had
been cocaptured with HA and processed and presented.
Cocaptured, Noncognate Antigen Is Presented and Can Qualify B Cells for
T-Cell Help. To visualize the capture of noncognate, “bystander”
antigen, we generated an adherent HEK cell line stably cotrans-
fected with MOG-GFP and HA (HEK HA MOG-GFP). We
cocultured these cells with IgHMOG B cells or with FluBI B cells.
Capture of MOG-GFP by IgHMOG B cells followed similar kinetics
with or without coexpression of HA, but MOG-GFP capture by
FluBI B cells was dependent on HA (Fig. 3A). This bystander
cocapture was as rapid as cognate capture, being observable after
3 min of contact, but quantitatively less. Not all antigens we examined
were cocaptured. For example, when FluBI B cells were exposed to
TE cells that express HA, MOG-GFP, and mOVA-Cherry, the
MOG-GFP is cocaptured but the mOVA-cherry is not (Fig. 3B).

Immunological sequelae of membrane antigen capture. (A) Changes in surface expression of various molecules following antigen capture. IgHMOG B cells were
exposed to TE MOG cells or to various comparison treatments for 8–20 h and then retrieved, immunolabeled, and measured by flow cytometry. Responses of B cells exposed
to different conditions are plotted in different colors, as shown in the legend. The vertical axis is the gemometric mean fluorescence value for the population of cells in the B-
cell gate. Each point shows the mean of pooled results from three independent experiments, and the error bars show the SEM. Asterisks indicate significant difference from
the unexposed condition (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001). (B) T-cell proliferation in response to B cells presenting antigen from different sources. IgHMOG B cells were
either exposed to TE MOG cells for 3 h and then retrieved and cocultured with MOG-specific 2D2 T cells (orange line) or else were added naive to the T cells in 96-well plates
with 30 μg/mL of MOG 35–55 (cyan line) or without any antigen (red line). The T cells were prelabeled with CTV to enable tracking of proliferation, and after 4 d at 37 °C, the
cocultured cells were retrieved, labeled for B220 and TCR alpha 3.2 (expressed on 2D2 T cells), and subjected to flow cytometry. The range labeled “CTV low” was used to
calculate the values used for C. (C) T-cell proliferation induced by B cells capturing membrane antigen, soluble protein, or soluble peptide. IgHMOG B cells were exposed to
adherent cells and then retrieved for coculture with MOG-specific 2D2 T cells or else were cocultured with T cells in the presence of the indicated antigen concentrations. 2D2
cells were prelabeled with CTV to track proliferation, and after 4 d at 37 °C, the cocultured cells were retrieved, labeled, and measured as in B. The proportion of CD4-positive,
CD19-negative cells in the CTV-low gate is displayed as a percentage of the total number of CD4-positive, CD19-negative cells (means of results from three independent
experiments). Red bars show results from conditions in which B cells were precultured with adherent cells, green bars from cells cultured with MOG 35–55 peptide, and blue
from cells cultured with MOG 1–125 recombinant protein. In the negative control, no antigen was added. Other controls include exposure of B cells to antigen-nonexpressing
TE 0 cells or to supernatants from TE MOG cells. Error bars show SEM, and asterisks indicate significant difference from the no-antigen, no-coculture condition (**P < 0.01,
***P < 0.001). (D) Effect of membrane antigen capture on T-cell–stimulating capacity of B cells. MOG-specific IgHMOG B cells (Left) or HA-specific FluBI B cells (Right) were
exposed to MOG or HA or a combination of both, expressed in TE cell membranes. After exposure, B cells were retrieved and cocultured with CTV-labeled MOG-specific 2D2
T cells for 4 d without additional antigen (red bars, left) with 10 μg/mL of MOG 35–55 peptide added (green bars, center) or with 5 μg/mL recombinant MOG 1–125 protein
(blue bars, right), and then proliferation of 2D2 cells was analyzed. Bars show mean percentages from three experiments of proliferated T cells in the CTV-low gate. Error bars
show SEM, and asterisks indicate significant difference from the TE 0, no additional antigen condition for each B cell type (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.001).

 Ig-bound antigens may be more efficiently presented to T cells than
other endocytosed cargo (14–16). To address whether coacquired
membrane antigens were processed and presented on MHC class II,
we used TE cell lines stably transfected with MOG and HA or with
HA alone. Because WSN/33 HA-specific, class II-restricted transgenic
T cells were not available, we added a carboxy terminal fusion to the
HA including amino acids 323–339 of ovalbumin (OVA), a peptide
recognized by OT-II T cells in the context of I-Ab. IgHMOG B cells
were exposed to TE HA-OVA or TE MOG HA-OVA for 3 h and
then retrieved and cocultured with OT-II T cells for 4 d. T-cell

fused to the OT-II epitope (TE HA-OVA) or coexpressing
both HA-OVA and MOG (TE MOG HA-OVA) for 3 h and
then retrieved and cultured with CTV-labeled OT-II T
cells for 5 d. Dot plots show CTV intensity against CD25
immunofluorescence for CD4-positive, CD19-negative
cells. MOG (blue) is recognized by the IgHMOG BCR; HA
(orange) is recognized by the FluBI BCR; and the OVA
epitope (red) presented in the context of the I-Ab MHCII
expressed by both B-cell types is recognized by the OT-II
TCR. The range in Upper Left marked “CTV-low” was
used to calculate the percentages displayed in the col-
umn scatter graph (B). (B) Column scatter graph show-

that fall in the CTV-low gate. Cyan and blue triangles
show results from cocultures with IgHMOG B cells pre-
viously exposed to TE HA-OVA or TE MOG HA-OVA,
respectively; orange and red circles show results from
cocultures with FluBI B cells previously exposed to TE
HA-OVA or TE MOG HA-OVA, respectively. Results from
the four conditions pooled from three independent
experiments were analyzed by one-way analysis of
variance followed by Dunnett’s test. Asterisks indicate
significant difference from the IgHMOG + TE HA-OVA
condition (***P < 0.0005, ****P < 0.0001). (C) Cytokine
concentrations in supernatants from OT-II T-cell pro-
liferation assays like that shown in A were measured by
ELISA. Color scheme is the same as B. Bars show mean
and error bars 95% confidence intervals of data pooled
from two similar experiments. Results for IFN-γ, in-
terleukin-2 (IL-2), and IL-4 are shown as indicated on the
horizontal axis. Asterisks indicate significant difference from IgHMOG + TE HA-OVA condition (two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni tests, *P < 0.0001). (D) IgHMOG
B cells (triangles) or FluBI B cells (circles) were exposed to TE cells expressing OVA at the cell surface (TE mOVA, magenta symbols) or coexpressing both MOG and
mOVA (TE MOG mOVA, cyan symbols) or a single fusion protein (TE MOG-OVA, blue symbols). After 3 h, the B cells were retrieved and cocultured with CTV-labeled
OT-II (left six columns) or 2D2 T cells (right six columns) for 3 d, and then the proliferation of the T cells was assessed by flow cytometry. Vertical axis shows percentage
of T cells in the CTV-low, CD25-high gate. Each point is the median of triplicate wells, and in each condition, data are shown from three independent experiments.
Asterisks show significant difference from the FluBI + TE mOVA + 2D2 negative control condition (****P < 0.0001). (E) Flow cytometric confirmation of membrane
location of MOG and OVA antigens. The TE mOVA and TE MOG mOVA cell lines used in the experiment shown in C were immunolabeled with mouse anti-MOG and
rabbit anti-OVA primaries and Dylight 405 anti-mouse and Alexa 488 anti-rabbit secondaries; washed; and measured. The quadrants are set to 99% of the TE
0 negative control in Bottom Left. Gray contours show TE 0 cells, red contours TE mOVA, and blue contours TE MOG mOVA.

HA-OVA, IgHMOG B cells stimulated robust proliferation in OT-II T
cells, and this was dependent on MOG (Fig. 4 A and B). The increase
in CD25 expression was not as great as in the cognate capture con-
dition (Fig. 4A), and the percentage of proliferated T cells was also
lower (Fig. 4B). We also saw secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-4 in the
interaction between B cells presenting a cocaptured antigen and T
cells responding to that antigen, albeit less than in the cognate cap-
ture condition (Fig. 4C). Presentation of the noncognate antigen is
dependent on cocapture, because mOVA, which contains the OT-II
epitope but is not cocaptured with HA or with MOG (Fig. 3B), is also
not presented to OT-II T cells by IgHMOG or FluBI B cells after
exposure to TE MOG mOVA (Fig. 4D). To be certain that this result
was not due to inadequate expression of the mOVA protein at the
cell membrane, we confirmed the accessibility of extracellular,
membrane-bound OVA in live TE MOG mOVA cells (Fig. 4E).
To test whether cocaptured antigen would qualify B cells for
T-cell help, we used the same combination of model antigens—
that is, IgHMOG B cells capturing antigen from TE cells expressing
both MOG and HA-OVA—but extended the subsequent coculture
of IgHMOG B cells with OT-II T cells to 7 d. To exclude the in-
volvement of BCR-independent antigen uptake and the possibility
that the mere fact of capturing antigen stimulates antibody pro-
duction, we included negative controls of IgHMOG B cells inter-
acting with TE HA-OVA or with TE MOG HA. As a positive
control, another cell line was established that stably expresses MOG
fused to the OT-II OVA epitope (TE MOG-OVA). We exposed
the IgHMOG B cells to the TE cells expressing the different antigen
combinations, retrieved and cocultured them with OT-II T cells, and
measured anti-MOG antibodies in the culture supernatants. Omitting
the T cells, the OVA epitope, or MOG, no antibodies were detected.
When OT-II T cells were present and the OVA epitope was included
in the B-cell cognate antigen, antibody production was robust. We
clearly detected antibodies also when the OVA epitope was present
on the HA antigen (Fig. 5A). Autoreactive B cells that present
cocaptured viral antigen can thus be triggered to produce autoanti-
bodies by unrelated antiviral T cells. To test whether cocaptured
antigen could mediate T-cell help in an in vivo setting, we exposed
IgHMOG B cells to adherent cells expressing the same four combi-
nations of antigens and adoptively transferred them into Rag −/− mice,
together with OT-II T cells. Two weeks later, the mice were killed and
anti-MOG antibodies in the serum were measured using an IgG2a-
specific secondary antibody. Results mirrored those obtained in vitro:
Antibodies were clearly produced in the cocapture condition (anti-
genic cells coexpressing MOG and HA-OVA)—at a lower level than
in the cognate capture paradigm (cells expressing MOG-OVA) but
well above the baseline level (Fig. 5B). IgG2a production in the two
negative control conditions (cells expressing either HA-OVA alone or
MOG and HA) was not significantly different from baseline.
Discussion
Capture of antigen from membranes represents an alternative way of
collecting antigen for B cells. It leads to strong activation of the B cell
and robust antigen presentation. We show that membrane capture
carries the risk that other antigens than the cognate one are cocap-
tured via the BCR, with two potentially pathological consequences:
(i) Antiviral B cells acquire autoantigens together with the viral an-
tigen and activate autoreactive T cells, and (ii) autoreactive B cells
acquire viral antigens together with the autoantigen and get T-cell
help from antiviral T cells to produce autoantibodies (Fig. 5C). We
provide evidence that both consequences can occur.
It is clear from our results that not all combinations of antigen,
although present in the same membrane, will be cocaptured. The
absence of significant cocapture of the membrane–OVA fusion
protein indicates that the phenomenon does not involve wholesale

Antibody production following cocapture-
dependent T-cell help. (A) MOG-specific IgHMOG B cells
were exposed to adherent TE cells expressing MOG
and HA separately, HA-OVA alone, MOG and the HA-
OVA fusion, or MOG-OVA fusion (TE MOG-OVA); re-
trieved; and cocultured with (inverted red triangles) or
without (open blue circles) OT-II T cells. After 7 d, se-
creted anti-MOG antibodies were assayed by labeling
MOG-expressing or -nonexpressing reporter cells with
the supernatants and detecting the bound antibodies
with an anti-mouse IgG-specific secondary by flow
cytometry (see Materials and Methods). The vertical
axis shows the MOG-specific binding calculated as the
ratio of geometric mean fluorescence (GMF) MOG-
expressing:-nonexpressing reporter cells. All nine data
points are plotted for each condition (Three Experi-
ments × Three Replicate Cultures). Median values from
the three experiments were pooled and analyzed by
Kruskal–Wallis test and each condition compared with
the no T cells condition (***P < 0.001). (B) MOG-spe-
cific IgHMOG B cells were exposed to adherent TE cells
expressing HA-OVA alone, MOG and HA separately,
MOG and the HA-OVA fusion, or MOG-OVA fusion
(TE MOG-OVA); retrieved; and adoptively transferred
into Rag−/− mice previously given OT-II T cells. After
2 wk, serum levels of anti-MOG IgG2a were mea-
sured by flow cytometry exactly as described in A but
using an anti-mouse IgG2a-specific secondary anti-
body. Each point shows the value from the serum from
one mouse. GMF ratios were subjected to one-way
ANOVA, followed by Dunnett’s test to compare each
of the four experimental conditions with the un-
manipulated (serum from Rag−/− mice given neither B
cells nor T cells) condition (**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001,
unmarked groups not significantly different from un-
manipulated). (C) Hypothetical model of the bystander antigen cocapture and presentation phenomenon in which an autoreactive B cell cocaptures self- and viral
antigen from an infected cell and fraudulently gains T-cell help from a viral antigen-specific T cell, leading to the secretion of autoantibodies.

 capture of large fragments of membrane and is likely to be limited
to a subset of protein antigens that either share some particular
localization in the membrane or else have some direct interaction.
One possibility, for example, is that the interaction we observe here
depends on the interaction between sialic acid residues on the
MOG protein and the sialic acid-binding domain of the HA (17).
This would limit the phenomenon to the set of sialated proteins,
which includes much but not all of the membrane proteome (18). A
major function of viral glycoproteins is attachment to host cell
membranes, and therefore, the likelihood that viral proteins bind to
the extracellular domains of membrane proteins is high.
A limitation of our study is that antigen capture takes place
in vitro. Experimentally, this enables us to control the coexpression
of antigens, and to be sure that they are captured directly by B cells
rather than by some third cell type, but begs the question of how
and where B cells capture and cocapture antigen in vivo. A large
body of work has demonstrated that soluble antigens and fluid-
borne viral particles are trapped and offered to B cells in the sec-
ondary lymphoid tissue by specialized cells including subcapsular
macrophages and follicular dendritic cells (19). However, we en-
visage that cocapture events relevant to autoimmunity are more
likely to occur during direct capture of viral antigen from infected
cells, which is likely to occur during the B-cell infiltration of infected
tissues that is seen during the acute response to virus (20).
The generation of autoantibodies via the cocapture mechanism
is likely to be limited in several parameters. First, it will only occur
during infections by viruses that encode abundant membrane
proteins—that is, enveloped viruses. Second, autoantigens are
limited to membrane proteins with an exposed extracellular domain.
Third, the availability of nonanergised autoreactive B cells will be
greatest for antigens that are not expressed in the bone marrow and
particularly for antigens whose expression is limited to tissues that are
not patrolled extensively by B cells under normal (i.e., noninflamed,
noninfected) conditions, thereby avoiding the mechanisms of pe-
ripheral tolerance that are known to be triggered by exposure to self-
antigen in the absence of cognate T-cell help (21). These limitations
might explain why this phenomenon rarely translates into the in-
fection-associated autoimmunity seen in clinics. Nevertheless this
mechanism represents an important deviation from a fundamental
principle of immunology that has stood up well since its formulation
in 1969: that antibody secretion by a B cell depends on an interaction
with a T cell recognizing the same antigen (22). We envisage that this
and further study of the phenomenon will lead to significant modi-
fications in the understanding of B-cell biology, autoimmunity,
and tolerance.
Materials and Methods
Methods are described in detail in SI Materials and Methods. Cell lines are
described in Table S1, primary immune cells are described in Table S2, and
abbreviations used in the text are explained in Table S3.
Mice and Primary Immune Cells. C57BL/6 and Rag −
/− mice were bred in the Uni-
versity of Basel Mouse Core Facility. Tg(TcraTcrb)425Cbn (OT-II) mice on a Rag2−
/−
background were a kind gift from Ed Palmer, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.
FluBI mice (23) were bred from founder members provided by Stephanie Dougan and
Hidde Ploegh, Whitehead Institute, Cambridge, MA. IgHMOG (ref. 12; also known as
Th B cells) and C57BL/6-Tg(Tcra2D2,Tcrb2D2)1Kuch/J (2D2) mice (13) were bred from
founder members provided by Guru Krishnamoorthy and Hartmut Wekerle, Max-
Planck-Institut für Neurobiologie, Martinsried, Germany. Primary immune cells were
obtained from spleens by mechanical disruption and brief settlement to remove tissue
fragments. B cells and CD4-positive T cells were obtained by negative selection using
biotinylated antibodies and magnetic beads from Miltenyi. All procedures involving
animals were considered and authorized by the Cantonal Tierversuchskommission.
Anti-MOG Antibody Assay. Anti-MOG antibodies were measured in sera and in
culture supernatants by flow cytometry as previously described (3). Supernatants
were mixed with two volumes of reporter cell suspension in PBS containing 2%
FCS by volume and 1 g/L of sodium azide on ice. The reporter cells include equal
numbers of unlabeled TE MOG cells and CTV-labeled TE 0 cells. After 30 min on
ice, the cells are washed, and antibodies adhering to the TE MOG cells are de-
tected with Alexa 647 anti-mouse IgG or PerCP-conjugated anti-IgG2a secondary
antibodies (both from Jackson Immunoresearch) and measured by flow cytom-
etry. TE 0 and TE MOG populations are then separated by CTV label, and the
ratio of geometric mean fluorescence intensities between TE MOG:TE 0 indicates
the abundance of antibody in the supernatant.
Statistics. Geometric mean fluorescence intensities of activation markers on B cells
were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (time versus condition) and the effect
of condition by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s Multiple Com-
parison Test to compare each of the conditions against “no stimulation.” T-cell pro-
liferation data (proportions of cells in the CTV-low gate) and anti-MOG Ig levels in sera
were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s test. Anti-MOG
IgG levels in culture supernantants, expressed as ratios of geometric mean immuno-
fluorescence TE MOG:TE 0, were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance (presence
of T cells versus antigen condition), revealing a strong interaction, with an effect of
condition limited to the T cells present condition. The Kruskal–Wallis test was there-
fore used to assess the effect of antigen condition, and Dunn’s Multiple Comparison
Test was used to compare each of the conditions with the T cells absent condition.
