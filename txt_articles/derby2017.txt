IMPORTANCE Trends in dementia incidence rates have important implications for planning
and prevention. To better understand incidence trends over time requires separation of age
and cohort effects, and few prior studies have used this approach.
OBJECTIVES To examine trends in dementia incidence and concomitant trends in
cardiovascular comorbidities among individuals aged 70 years or older who were enrolled in
the Einstein Aging Study between 1993 and 2015.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this birth cohort analysis of all-cause dementia
incidence in persons enrolled in the Einstein Aging Study from October 20, 1993, through
November 17, 2015, a systematically recruited, population-based sample of 1348 participants
from Bronx County, New York, who were 70 years or older without dementia at enrollment
and at least one annual follow-up was studied. Poisson regression was used to model
dementia incidence as a function of age, sex, educational level, race, and birth cohort, with
profile likelihood used to identify the timing of significant increases or decreases in incidence.
EXPOSURES Birth year and age.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident dementia defined by consensus case conference
based on annual, standardized neuropsychological and neurologic examination findings,
using criteria from the DSM-IV.
RESULTS Among 1348 individuals (mean [SD] baseline age, 78.5 [5.4] years; 830 [61.6%]
female; 915 [67.9%] non-Hispanic white), 150 incident dementia cases developed during
5932 person-years (mean [SD] follow-up, 4.4 [3.4] years). Dementia incidence decreased in
successive birth cohorts. Incidence per 100 person-years was 5.09 in birth cohorts before
1920, 3.11 in the 1920 through 1924 birth cohorts, 1.73 in the 1925 through 1929 birth cohorts,
and 0.23 in cohorts born after 1929. Change point analyses identified a significant decrease in
dementia incidence among those born after July 1929 (95% CI, June 1929 to January 1930).
The relative rate for birth cohorts before July 1929 vs after was 0.13 (95% CI, 0.04-0.41).
Prevalence of stroke and myocardial infarction decreased across successive birth cohorts,
whereas diabetes prevalence increased. Adjustment for these cardiovascular comorbidities
did not explain the decreased dementia incidence rates for more recent birth cohorts.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Analyses confirm decreasing dementia incidence in this
population-based sample. Whether decreasing incidence will contribute to reduced burden
of dementia given the aging of the population is not known.

 T
he world population older than 80 years is expected to
increase more than 3-fold by 2050.1 As the population
ages, dementia and Alzheimer disease are consuming
an increasing share of resources. Worldwide dementia preva-
lence is more than 47 million, and 7 million new cases de-
velop each year. Dementia prevalence has been projected to
doubleevery20yearsandtoreach115millionbytheyear2050.
Prevalence of Alzheimer disease, the most common cause of
dementia, is expected to reach 106 million by 2050.2
The projected increase in dementia prevalence is driven
by shifting demographics toward an older population. How-
ever, evidence suggests that dementia prevalence may have
decreased in recent decades.3 Decreasing incidence rates may
explain the observed decreases in prevalence and would sug-
gest a decrease in the projected burden of disease in the com-
ing decades. Earlier studies4-6 have found no significant
changes in dementia incidence through the 1980s. Studies of
more recent periods suggest that dementia incidence may be
decreasing in the United States and Western Europe,7-9 al-
though the opposite trend has been reported for Wales.10 Con-
firming that rates of dementia onset are decreasing has im-
portant implications for health care planning and resource
allocation. Furthermore, a strong body of evidence supports
the role of cardiovascular disease in cognitive decline and
dementia,11 and estimates indicate that more than half of all
cases of Alzheimer disease are attributable to modifiable car-
diovascular risk factors.12 Establishing whether decreasing in-
cidenceisattributabletodecreasingratesofcardiovasculardis-
ease would underscore the need for continuing prevention
efforts that target vascular risk factors to reduce the burden
of dementia.
Since 1993, the Einstein Aging Study (EAS) has systemati-
cally recruited and followed up noninstitutionalized individu-
als 70 years and older from Bronx County, New York.13 Inci-
dent dementia has consistently been ascertained using
standard diagnostic criteria. Confirming temporal trends in in-
cidence requires separation of age effects from cohort ef-
fects. Our goals were to determine whether there is evidence
of a decrease in dementia incidence across sequential birth co-
horts in the EAS population and to examine whether trends
in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease explained the ob-
served dementia trends. We thus conducted a cohort analy-
sis by year of birth for the EAS cohort. This approach allowed
for more precise separation of age and cohort effects than
would analyses that compare cohorts recruited decades apart.
Methods
Study Population
Between 1993 and 2004, Health Care Financing Administra-
tion/CentersforMedicaid&MedicareServices(HCFA/CMS)ros-
ters of Medicare-eligible persons 70 years or older were used
by the EAS to develop sampling frames of community-
residing individuals in Bronx County. Since 2004, New York
City Board of Elections registered voter lists for Bronx County
have been used because of changes in HCFA/CMS policies. In-
dividuals were mailed introductory letters, which were fol-
lowed by a brief telephone screening interview. Final screen-
ing and enrollment were completed at the EAS clinic. The
overlap of the HCFA/CMS and voter lists was estimated to be
90%. The demographic characteristics of participants en-
rolled using either list were similar. Methods for recruitment,
telephonescreeningprocedures,andconsentingprotocolshave
not changed since 1993, and retention rates and duration of
follow-up have also remained similar. Written informed con-
sent was obtained using protocols approved by the Institu-
tional Review Board of the Albert Einstein College of
Medicine.13 Data included a unique study identification num-
ber for each person.
Eligibilitycriteriawereageof70yearsorolder,fluentinEng-
lish, and no dementia at study entry. Comparison with US Cen-
sus data indicates that the cohort is representative of the Bronx

of1348EASparticipantsenrolledfromOctober20,1993,through
November 17, 2015, who had at least one annual follow-up.
Those in the analysis sample and those excluded were similar
at baseline with regard to mean age (78.5 vs 78.9 years; t test,
P = .97),sex(female,61.6%vs62.3%;χ2test,P = .74),andglobal
cognition based on the Blessed Information Memory Concen-
tration (BIMC) test15 (2.42 vs 3.12; t test, P = .81).
Follow-up Assessments
Annual assessments included a clinical neurologic examina-
tion, comprehensive neuropsychological assessments, medi-
cal history, blood pressure, anthropometrics, and psychoso-
cial assessments. Prevalence of myocardial infarction, stroke,
and diabetes was ascertained by self-report of physician di-
agnosis. Global cognitive performance was assessed using the
BIMC test.15 Depression was assessed using the Geriatric De-
pression Scale.16
Neurologic Examination and Dementia Diagnosis
The standardized neurologic examination was adapted from
the Unified Parkinson’
s Disease Rating Scale.17 The neurolo-
gist assigned a Hachinski Ischemic Score18 and a Clinical De-
mentia Rating19 and provided a clinical impression of the pres-
ence or absence of dementia.
Key Points
Question Has the incidence of all-cause dementia decreased in
successive birth cohorts in a representative sample of
community-residing adults in Bronx County, New York?
Findings Using a birth cohort analysis to disentangle age from
cohort effects, this study found that dementia incidence rates
decreased significantly among individuals born after 1929.
Adjustment for age, sex, educational level, and prevalence of
cardiovascular comorbidities did not explain the observed trend.
Meaning Additional studies are needed to determine whether
decreasing dementia incidence will offset the demographic shift to
older ages.

 Dementiadiagnosiswasbasedonstandardizedclinicalcri-
teria from the DSM-IV20 and required impairment in memory
plus at least one additional cognitive domain, accompanied by
evidenceoffunctionaldecline.Diagnoseswereassignedatcon-
sensus case conferences, which included comprehensive re-
view of cognitive test results, relevant neurologic signs and
symptoms,andfunctionalstatus.Memoryimpairmentwasde-
fined as scores of 1.5 SDs or more below the age-adjusted mean
for the Logical Memory test21 or a score of 24 or less on the Free
and Cued Selective Reminding Test–Free Recall.22 Func-
tional impairment was determined using the Lawton Brody
Scale,23 clinical evaluation, and informant questionnaires. To
ensure that diagnostic criteria were uniform over time, all in-
dividuals evaluated before the release of DSM-IV in 1994 were
retrospectively reconferenced according to DSM-IV criteria.20
A subset of individuals who participate in the EAS re-
ceive autopsies, providing an important quality control for di-
agnostic accuracy. A clinical diagnosis of dementia in the co-
hort has a positive predictive value of 96% for significant
pathologic findings.13
Statistical Analysis
After exploratory analyses of cohort demographic character-
istics and crude dementia incidence rates as a function of age
and date of birth, we fit locally weighted scatterplot smooth-
ing (LOESS) functions24 using generalized additive models25
to graphically identify patterns in the age-specific and birth
cohort–specific dementia incidence rates. Poisson regression
was used to model the incidence as a function of age, sex, race,
educational level, and birth cohort, with change points used
to identify the timing of noticeable increases or decreases in
incidence. Profile likelihood26 was used to estimate the change
points, with a change point allowed to possibly fall any time
between1915and1935.Thepossibilityofasecondchangepoint
was considered by fitting a model with 2 change points and
using likelihood ratio tests to select the best model. For the
comparison of a model with 2 change points versus 1 change
point, we used a P value of .025 as the threshold for selecting
the larger model. We also considered a model with a log-
linear trend in incidence as a function of birth year. Addi-
tionalmodelsincludedhistoryofmyocardialinfarction,stroke,
anddiabetestoascertainwhethertrendsinprevalenceofthese
conditions might account for changes in dementia incidence.

Results
Among the 1348 individuals in the analysis cohort (mean [SD]
baseline age, 78.5 [5.4] years; 830 [61.6%] female; 915 [67.9%]
non-Hispanic white), there were 150 incident cases of demen-
tia during 5932 person-years of follow-up (Table 1). The most
recent birth cohort included a higher proportion of African
American and Hispanic individuals, reflecting changes in the
surrounding community. Mean years of education was slightly
higher in the more recent birth cohorts. Baseline global cog-
nitive status (BIMC15) reflects that individuals were free of de-
mentia at baseline, with slightly better baseline global perfor-
manceamongindividualsborninmorerecentyears,consistent
with their younger age and higher educational level.
Table 2 gives the crude dementia incidence rates as a func-
tion of age and dates of birth. Overall, the expected trend for
increasing dementia incidence with increasing age was evi-
dent. Within each age range, dementia incidence rates were
lower across sequential birth cohorts, particularly after 1929.
Figure 1 displays LOESS plots of age-specific dementia inci-
dence. The plot demonstrates the expected association of in-
creasing incidence with increasing age. Figure 1 also shows a
consistent pattern within each age group of decreasing inci-
dence in sequential birth years, with an accelerated decrease
in incidence rates apparent for those born in the middle to late
1920s.
To further explore this trend, we fit Poisson regression
models with change points to identify birth years when there
was a significant change in incidence rates. Models adjusted
for age, sex, race, and educational level indicated a signifi-
cant change point for individuals born after July 1929 (95% CI,
June 1929 to January 1930). Model fit was not improved by ad-
dition of a second change point (likelihood ratio for the model
with 1 change point was −647.671 and for 2 change points was
−645.601; likelihood ratio test with 2 degrees of freedom,
P = .13). Furthermore, a model for a simpler, log-linear trend
in incidence by birth cohort did not fit the data as well as the

 change point model with the same number of parameters, as
indicated by a smaller log-likelihood value. To illustrate this
trend, we used the Poisson model to estimate dementia inci-
dence for a white woman aged 80 years born before or after
the change point at July 1929. Before July 1929, dementia in-
cidence was 2.26 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 1.67-3.07) for
an80-year-oldwhitewoman.Forawhitewomanaged80years
born after July 1929, the incidence rate was 0.29 per 100 per-
son-years (95% CI, 0.09-0.92). The relative rate for a white
woman aged 80 years born before vs after July 1929 was 0.13
(95% CI, 0.04-0.41), reflecting a more than 85% lower inci-
dence in the later birth cohorts. Because individuals older than
85 years are not represented in the later birth cohorts, we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis restricted to follow-up before the
ageof85years.Resultswereunchangedfromthoseintheover-
all cohort.
To explore whether decreasing rates of cardiovascular dis-
ease and cardiovascular risk factors may have affected the de-
mentia incidence rates, we explored age-specific trends for
stroke, myocardial infarction, and diabetes by year (Figure 2).
The observed trends in the EAS cohort are consistent with na-
tional data from the United States showing reductions in car-
diovascular disease rates across the past decades.27,28 The age-
specific prevalence of myocardial infarction and stroke has
decreased in our cohort across sequential birth cohorts. In con-
trast to the favorable myocardial infarction and stroke trends,
we observed a notable increase in diabetes prevalence in later
birth cohorts that is also consistent with national trends. How-

 ever, when the Poisson models of dementia incidence by birth
year were further adjusted for prevalence of myocardial in-
farction, stroke, or diabetes, the results remained unchanged
and a significant decrease in dementia incidence among indi-
viduals born after mid-1929 remained.
Discussion
This cohort analysis of age-specific dementia incidence rates
by birth year demonstrated decreased incidence of dementia
in more recent birth cohorts among older individuals in Bronx
County, New York. The decrease appears to have occurred for
individuals born after mid-1929. The observed relative rate of
incidence for those born after vs before July 1929 was 0.13 per
100 person-years. These results are consistent with previous
studies that have suggested decreased dementia incidence in
more recent periods7-9 and no significant trends before the
1990s.4-7,29
Our analytic approach differs from prior studies8,9 in that
we examined incidence according to year of birth, whereas
most prior studies8,9 have compared dementia rates in co-
horts in a specified age bracket enrolled during different pe-
riods (eg, decades). Our birth cohort approach based on indi-
vidual years of birth allows for a more precise separation of age
andcohorteffects,whichmightbedifficulttodisentanglewhen
the age bands or enrollment periods studied are wide. De-
spite this difference, the EAS results are very consistent with
earlier work, suggesting that any decrease in dementia inci-
dence has been during more recent decades.
The Rotterdam Study9 reported a 25% decrease in all-
cause dementia rates between 1990 and 2000. The timing of
this decrease coincides with our observed reduction in age-
specific incidence among individuals born after 1929 be-
causetheearlierRotterdamcohortwasbornbetween1900and
1930, whereas the later cohort was born between 1910 and
1940. Although the reduction in incidence did not reach sta-
tistical significance in the Rotterdam Study, the suggestion of
a true decrease in dementia rates is strengthened by their ob-
servation of less cerebral small vessel disease and larger total
brain volumes among individuals enrolled in the more recent
period.9 The EAS was unable to confirm whether cohort dif-
ferences in brain pathologic findings may underlie the ob-
served decrease in dementia incidence.
More recent data from the Framingham cohort demon-
strate a 20% decrease in dementia incidence rates since the
late 1970s among those older than 60 years.8 Similarly, Rocca
et al7 reported a small but statistically significant downward
trend of 3% per year in all-cause and Alzheimer disease de-
mentia among individuals aged 70 to 94 years during 1985 to
1994. A similar decrease in Alzheimer disease incidence was
observed among individuals 65 years and older in the Chi-
cago Health and Aging Project cohort between 1997 and 2008,
although the trend did not reach statistical significance.30
Earlier studies5,7 have found no decrease in dementia in-
cidence rates for cohorts followed up before 1990. This find-
ing is consistent with our results indicating no decrease in de-
mentia incidence rates among individuals aged 70 to 84 years
who were born from 1910 to 1930. Data from Rochester, Min-
nesota, indicate random fluctuations in dementia incidence
beforethemid-1980s,withnoevidenceofadecrease,7andsug-
gest an increase in rates between 1965 and 1974.5 There was
no evidence of a birth cohort effect on dementia incidence for
individuals born between 1885 and 1930, although birth co-
horts after 1930 were not examined.7 Consistent with our find-
ings, a birth cohort analysis of 2 cohorts in western Pennsyl-
vania demonstrated decreasing rates of cognitive decline with
increasing age for individuals born between 1932 and 1943 vs
earlier birth cohorts.31
Priorstudies4,5,7-9,30havevariedwithregardtothemethod
for ascertaining dementia incidence. The application of con-
sistent diagnostic procedures over time is critical to the inter-
pretation of temporal trends. A strength of our study is that
dementia diagnoses were based on information from stan-
dardized study assessments and diagnostic criteria applied to
all participants across the study period. Similarly, the Framing-
ham, Rotterdam, and Chicago study results are based on clini-
cal evaluations and diagnostic criteria applied uniformly over
time.8,9,30 In contrast, the studies4,5,7 from the Rochester co-
hort relied on diagnostic codes from administrative data-
bases. Despite these important differences, there appears to
be consistent evidence across diverse cohorts that dementia
incidence may be decreasing.
Decreasingincidenceratesareconsistentwithpreviousre-
ports of decreased dementia prevalence during the past 10 to
20 years in the United States3 and Western Europe.32,33 De-
creased prevalence may result from decreasing rates of dis-
ease onset, increasing rates of cure or remission, or decreas-
ingratesofsurvivalafterdementiadiagnosis.Giventhecurrent
lack of treatments to reverse Alzheimer disease or dementia34
and data suggesting that survival among patients with demen-
tia has increased,35 it is likely that the favorable prevalence
trendsareattributabletodecreasedriskofdementiaonset.Con-
sistent with this hypothesis, a recent analysis36 of administra-
tive data from Canada found decreasing dementia incidence
concurrentwithincreasingprevalencebetween2005and2013.

 Some researchers have suggested that trends toward in-
creasing level of education may underlie decreases in demen-
tia incidence and prevalence.3,8 Although there was a shift to-
ward higher education in our cohort, this trend did not explain
our findings. Similarly, adjustment for education did not at-
tenuate the cohort effects for decreased cognitive decline with
age observed by Dodge et al.31 Improved nutrition over suc-
cessive birth cohorts might also have affected dementia risk.
We were not able to assess this possibility because the EAS has
not routinely ascertained dietary data.
Vascular risk factors increase the risk of developing
dementia,11 and the incidence of stroke has decreased and the
control of several cardiovascular risk factors has improved in
the United States during the past several decades.27 Al-
though the decreasing dementia incidence that we observed
may be partially related to decreases in the prevalence of car-
diovascularcomorbidities,thesefactorsdidnotexplaintheob-
served results. Failure to detect an effect of these trends may
have occurred because our analysis was based on self-
reported medical history and may not reflect the overall bur-
den of vascular disease in the population.
We observed an adverse trend for the prevalence of diabe-
testhatmayportendincreasingdementiaincidenceinthecom-
ing decades. The increasing prevalence of diabetes among EAS
participants in later birth cohorts may reflect better treatment
and survival among individuals with diabetes born in more re-
cent decades. The trend is consistent with data on the world-
wide increase in diabetes prevalence37 and given evidence that
links diabetes with dementia risk. This increase in diabetes
prevalence may adversely affect dementia rates in the future.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine whether
our observed change point in dementia incidence was ex-
plained by the demographic shift in the racial/ethnic compo-
sition of the EAS cohort. In an analysis restricted to only white
individuals, results were similar to those observed in the total
sample, suggesting that shifting demographic characteristics
did not explain our results.
Strengths and Limitations
A strength of our study is that the EAS is a community-based
sample that is representative of the surrounding population.
Community-based samples provide critical information re-
garding secular trends that cannot be assessed in referral
samples of individuals with cognitive complaints. A limita-
tionofourstudyisthesmallnumberofdementiacasesforlater
birth years. Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of demen-
tia in the elderly population, accounting for 60% to 80% of de-
mentia cases. Thus, although a decrease in all-cause demen-
tia is likely to reflect changes in Alzheimer disease rates, we
could not address this issue because sample size constraints
precluded our ability to analyze dementia subtypes. Never-
theless, the observed decrease in incidence after mid-1929 was
robust in analyses that adjusted for differences in demo-
graphic characteristics and prevalence of cardiovascular co-
morbidity.
Conclusions
Future analyses in larger cohorts are required to confirm
whether dementia incidence is decreasing. If the trend is con-
firmed, it remains to be seen whether decreasing dementia in-
cidence will offset the ongoing demographic shift to older ages
given that dementia incidence increases exponentially after
60 years of age.38 In addition, despite advances in prevention
and control of cardiovascular disease in recent decades, the
future influence of the current diabetes epidemic on demen-
tia incidence remains unknown. The observed trends high-
