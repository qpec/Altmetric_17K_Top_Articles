Abstract
Background
Married people have lower rates of mortality and report better physical and mental health at
older ages, compared to their unmarried counterparts. However, there is limited evidence
on the association between marriage and physical capability, the ability to carry out the
tasks of daily living, which is predictive of future mortality and social care use. We investigate
the association between marital status and physical capability at mid to later life in England
and the United States.
Methods
We examine the association between marriage and physical capability at mid to later life in
England and the USA using two performance-based measures of physical capability: grip
strength and walking speed. Multiple linear regression was carried out on Wave 4 (2008) of
the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and Waves 8 and 9 (2006 and 2008) of the
US Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
Results
In age adjusted models married men and women had better physical capability than their
unmarried counterparts. Much of the marriage advantage was explained by the greater
wealth of married people. However, remarried men were found to have stronger grip
strength and widowed and never married men had a slower walking speed than men in their
first marriage, which was not explained by wealth, demographic and socioeconomic charac-
teristics, health behaviours, chronic disease or depressive symptoms. There were no differ-
ences in the association between England and the USA.
Conclusions
Marriage may be an important factor in maintaining physical capability in both England and
the USA, particularly because of the greater wealth which married people have accrued by
the time they reach older ages. The grip strength advantage for remarried men may be due
to unobserved selective factors into remarriage.

 Introduction
Research shows that those who are married have better physical and psychological health and
greater longevity than their unmarried counterparts [1] [2] [3], as well as better health than
those who are in unmarried cohabiting relationships [4]. There is mixed evidence on whether
men’s health benefits more from marriage relative to women’s [5] [3]. Different explanations
have been proposed for the association, including that marriage protects health through
increased economic resources, improved health behaviours and the provision of social support
(1). Alternatively, unmarried people’s experiences of transitions out of marriage may be delete-
rious to health because of the accompanying stress, emotional upheaval, subsequent lapse in
health behaviours and loss of economic resources [6]. The third explanation is that marriage is
selective of those who have better physical and mental health [7] [8] [9] [10] and greater eco-
nomic resources [11] in the first instance.
Despite the health advantages associated with marriage, the past 40 to 50 years have wit-
nessed a decline in marriage, an increase in the prevalence of divorce and a rise in unmarried
cohabitation in both England and the USA [12]. Consequently, there are now more people
entering mid to later life unmarried which, given the strong association between marriage and
health and coupled with the ageing population, could result in an increase in numbers with
poorer health at older ages.
Whilst there is much evidence showing the association between marriage and physical and
mental health, little is known about the association between marriage and physical capability.
Physical capability is the capacity to undertake the physical tasks of daily living [13] and is a
key indicator of healthy ageing, not specific to a particular disease or condition [14] [15]. Phys-
ical capability is predictive of subsequent disability [16] and mortality [17], is associated with
physical health [18] and has shown to be predictive of social care use, including entry into
long-term care [19] and admission to hospital [20].
Existing evidence on marriage and physical capability has largely used self-reported mea-
sures of activities of daily living (ADL) or mobility limitations, and found that those who are
married report fewer limitations than their unmarried counterparts [21] [22]. The few studies
that have used the performance-based measures of physical capability, which measure
strength, balance, coordination and flexibility, have also found that married people have better
physical capability than those who are unmarried [23] [24]. There is also some evidence of
gender differences in the association with never married men having relatively poorer physical
capability than never married women [21] [23].
The majority of studies which have investigated marriage and physical capability have also
treated those who are married as a homogenous group, not distinguishing between first mar-
riage and subsequent marriages. These two groups of people have differing relationship histo-
ries, with those who are remarried having experienced a transition out of marriage, which
could modify any association with physical capability. At present it is unknown whether those
who are remarried have similar levels of physical capability to those who have remained in
their first marriage, although there is some evidence that those who are in a subsequent mar-
riage have a higher number of activity limitations than those in their first marriage [25].
The association between marriage and physical capability may be modified by national con-
text. England and the United States of America (USA) are two countries which are useful to
compare as although they hold many similarities there are some key differences between them
which may alter any association between marriage and physical capability. Firstly, there are
differences in marriage and divorce patterns, the USA has higher marriage and divorce rates
than England [26], therefore divorce may be a more normative experience for people in the
USA and consequently may have a weaker association with physical capability. Alternatively,

 evidence shows that income levels drop post-divorce, particularly for women, who not only
have lower incomes from paid work than men in the first instance, but are also more likely to
be the main provider of childcare which may limit their participation in paid work [27] [28].
Consequently, those who are divorced may be more reliant upon welfare provision. Welfare
provision in England is more generous than in the USA, particularly through universal free
health care. Therefore we may expect to see a stronger association between marriage and phys-
ical capability in the USA than in England, particularly for women. There is also evidence of
physical health differentials between England and the USA at older ages [29], as well as differ-
ences in levels of physical capability at older ages, with those in the USA having poorer physical
capability than their counterparts in England [30] [31]. All of these differences could translate
into differing associations between marriage and physical capability, which could further our
understanding of the underlying mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge there is no
research which has investigated the differences in the association between marriage and per-
formance-based physical capability in England and the USA.
In this article nationally representative data from England and the USA are used to investi-
gate: whether the performance-based measures of physical capability vary by marital status,
differentiating between those who are in their first marriage and those in a subsequent mar-
riage; whether there are differences by gender; and whether the associations vary between
England and the USA. The contribution of socioeconomic, behavioural and health factors to
these associations were also tested.
Methods
Data
Data were drawn from the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and the US Health
and Retirement Study (HRS). These are nationally representative longitudinal studies of peo-
ple aged 50 years and older in England [32], and of people aged 51 years and older in the USA
[33]. Both surveys are part of a wider group of international harmonised longitudinal studies
on ageing and share many of the same measures, which makes them ideal for cross-national
comparative research. Ethical approval for ELSA was obtained from the UK National Research
and Ethics Committee and for HRS from the University of Michigan’s Institutional Review
Board.
HRS administers the performance based measures on alternating halves of its sample at
each wave; therefore, in order to obtain a sample with a complete set of outcome measures, we
pooled the two sample halves from two successive waves: Wave 8 (2006) and Wave 9 (2008).
All the other HRS variables included in this analysis were taken from the year in which the par-
ticipant’s performance-based tests were collected. We used Waves 8 and 9 of HRS as these
were the first waves that the physical performance tests had been administered. In order to
ensure that the measures used in ELSA were collected in a comparable time frame to those in
HRS, data from Wave 4 (2008) was used.
Physical capability
Two measures of physical capability were utilised: grip strength and walking speed; both of
which have been widely used in research based in England and the USA [15] [34] [35] [36].
Grip strength was measured on both studies using a Smedley Dynamometer. The highest grip
strength measurement out of the first two tests on each hand was used and was adjusted for
height in metres. We adjusted for height in metres because of the well-documented direct posi-
tive correlation between height and grip strength [37] [38] [39]. Walking speed was measured
by respondents walking 2.44 metres (8 feet) in ELSA and 2.50 metres (8.2 feet) in HRS, whilst

 being timed. The test is performed twice and the mean time in metres per second from the two
tests was used. The test is performed on all those aged 60 years and older in ELSA and aged 65
years and older in HRS, so for comparability the analysis of walking speed was restricted to
those aged 65 years and older in ELSA. Those who were unable to do the tests for health rea-
sons (grip strength: ELSA n = 86 out of a sample of 7,478; HRS n = 349 out of a sample of
12,750; walking speed: ELSA n = 223 out of sample of 3,645; HRS n = 538 out of a sample of
8,337) were given an age and sex adjusted mean value representative of the bottom quintile, as
it would be expected that those who were unable to perform the tests due to health reasons
would have poor physical capability. This approach has been used previously for the perfor-
mance-based measures [40] and more information is provided in Tables A and B in S1 File.
We ran a sensitivity analysis to investigate the robustness of this approach and whether exclud-
ing those who were unable to do the tests from the analysis, or giving these individuals either
their gender age specific mean score, or gender age specific lowest score gave divergent results.
The analysis (provided in S1 File) showed that the results were similar overall to those using
the gender age specific bottom quintile score.
Marital status
Our exposure of interest was current legal marital status. The current marital status measure
distinguished between those in a first marriage and those in a subsequent marriage and was
categorised into first marriage, remarried, divorced / separated, widowed and never married.
In ELSA the marital status measure collected at each wave differentiated between those in a
first marriage and those in a remarriage, however in HRS this was not the case and instead the
RAND derived variable [41], which identified how many times a respondent had been married
at each wave, was used to create a remarried category. Those who were in a same-sex civil part-
nership (ELSA only n = 17) were assigned to either the first marriage or remarried category,
dependent on their prior marital status. Those who were unmarried but cohabiting were
assigned their legal marital status (ELSA n = 392 and HRS n = 422).
Covariates
The analysis adjusted for a number of covariates to help explain any association between mari-
tal status and physical capability, comprising demographic, socioeconomic, health behaviour
and physical and mental health measures.
Demographic covariates include age, sex, ethnicity, and work and parental status. Age was
included as a non-linear term as physical capability declines faster at older ages [42]. In ELSA
ethnicity was dichotomised into white and non-white, due to ELSA having insufficiently large
sample sizes of England’s ethnic minority groups to categorise ethnicity in a more detailed
way. In HRS ethnicity was categorised into white / Hispanic / black / other to reflect the ethnic
composition of the USA.
Education and wealth have been used to measure socioeconomic position. Education was
measured using the number of years of full time education and was divided into three catego-
ries: low (0–11 years of schooling, O-level equivalent, in ELSA; 0–12 years, high school or less,
in HRS), medium (12–13 years, A-level equivalent, in ELSA; 13–15 years, more than high
school but not a college graduate, in HRS) and high (14+ years, higher education qualification,
in ELSA; 16+ years, college or more, in HRS). Education was categorised in this way to be
broadly equivalent to the International Standard Classification of Education 2011 and the
same categorisation has been employed in prior comparative research using ELSA and HRS
[29] [43] [44].

 Wealth was used rather than income as it has shown to be a more appropriate measure of
socioeconomic position at older ages (32). Both HRS and ELSA contain detailed questions on
income, assets and debt, which make it possible to derive accurate measures of wealth. Total
wealth was used, which is the sum of savings, investments, physical wealth and housing wealth
after financial and mortgage debt have been subtracted. Wealth was measured at the couple
level and was categorised into quintiles from low to high.
A number of health behaviours including physical activity, smoking status and BMI were
included in the analysis. Physical activity, including any physical activity from both leisure
activities and paid work, was self-reported and categorised into sedentary, low, moderate, and
high. Smoking status was categorised into never smoked, ever smoked and current smokers.
Objectively measured height and weight were used to derive body mass index (BMI), which
was categorised according to the World Health Organisation guidelines: 0–24.9 kg/m2 (under-
weight to normal weight); 25–29.9 kg/m2 (overweight); 30+ kg/m2 (obese). The underweight
and normal weight categories were combined as only relatively small numbers of participants
were underweight (ELSA underweight n = 68; HRS underweight n = 180). BMI was catego-
rised, rather than treated as continuous, since the association between physical capability and
BMI was not linear.
Three measures of physical and mental health were included: self-rated health; number of
doctor diagnosed health conditions and depressive symptoms. The measure of self-rated
health was identical on both surveys and was collapsed into three categories: excellent to very
good; good; and fair to poor. Reported number of doctor-diagnosed chronic health conditions
comprised hypertension, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart disease, stroke and
arthritis and was categorised into 0 conditions, 1 condition, 2 conditions, and 3 or more condi-
tions. Depressive symptoms were captured by the 8-item version of the Centre for Epidemio-
logic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), which has been dichotomised into <3 and �3
depressive symptoms, as 3 or more symptoms are indicative of clinical depression [45].
Analytic sample and statistical analysis
The final analytic samples in ELSA and HRS comprised only cases with complete data. There
were different analytic samples for the analysis of grip strength and walking speed. This was
largely because the walking speed analysis was restricted to those aged 65 years and over as 65
was the minimum age walking speed was measured in HRS. Details of the analytic samples in
ELSA and HRS are shown in Fig 1.
Overall there were few marital status differences between the complete sample and the ana-
lytic sample, but more detail on any potential bias introduced due to differences between the
analytic sample and the cases which were omitted is provided in Tables A and B in S2 File.
Linear regression was used to estimate mean differences in grip strength and walking speed
according to marital status. Linear regression was used as both grip strength and walking
speed were normally distributed. The base model included age and demographic characteris-
tics (model 1). To explore socioeconomic, behavioural and health variables that might lie on
the explanatory pathways linking marital status to physical capability, we additionally adjusted
for education and wealth (model 2), and physical activity, smoking status, BMI, self-rated
health, chronic health conditions and depressive symptoms (model 3).
The analysis was carried out separately in ELSA and HRS and stratified by gender. Both
HRS and ELSA samples contain couples and stratification by gender avoids problems due to
clustering in physical capability at the household level. We tested for marital status by gender
interactions separately on each survey and then combined the data for both surveys and tested
for marital status by country interactions for men and for women.

 Results
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the ELSA and HRS analytic samples. On the measures of
physical capability individuals in HRS had stronger mean grip strength than individuals in
ELSA, whilst individuals in ELSA had faster mean walking speed than those in HRS. Men in
both surveys had stronger mean grip strength and faster mean walking speed than women. A
higher percentage in ELSA remained in their first marriage than in HRS and a higher percent-
age in HRS were remarried or divorced. There were higher percentages whom were never
married in ELSA than in HRS. Overall, the HRS sample was also older, comprised more
women, more highly educated, more likely to be parents, and more likely to have chronic
health conditions than the ELSA sample.
Grip strength
Tables 2 and 3 summarise the regression analysis of marital status on grip strength for men
and women in ELSA and HRS. Tables showing the effect sizes for all the covariates in the mod-

Men.
After adjusting for age and demographic measures (model 1), widowed and never
married men in ELSA had a weaker grip strength than men in their first marriage (0.73 kg/m
and 0.61 kg/m weaker, respectively). In HRS all groups of unmarried men had a weaker grip
strength than men in their first marriage. In both samples much of the association was attenu-
ated once additionally adjusting for the socioeconomic measures (model 2), and it was largely
wealth which explained the weaker grip strength among widowed and never married men and

strength than men in their first marriage (0.61 kg/m stronger in ELSA and 0.22 kg/m stronger
in HRS) when adjusting for the demographic measures (model 1) and further adjusting for the
socioeconomic measures (model 2) and health behaviours, physical health and mental health

 We tested for interactions by country and there was no moderation in the association by
country (results not shown).
Women.
Table 3 shows the results for women. In model 1 (adjusted for the demographic
measures) women in ELSA who were divorced or never married had a weaker grip strength
than women in their first marriage (0.42 kg/m and 0.48 kg/m weaker, respectively) and this
was attenuated once adjusting for the socioeconomic measures (model 2), with wealth
accounting for most of the attenuation. In model 1 (adjusted for demographic measures) HRS
divorced and widowed women had weaker grip strength than those in their first marriage
(0.29 kg/m and 0.49 kg/m weaker respectively); for divorced women the association was atten-
uated when adjusting for the socioeconomic measures (model 2). The socioeconomic mea-
sures partly attenuated widowed women’s weaker grip strength, but the association was fully
attenuated on the introduction of the health behaviours and the physical and mental health
measures (model 3). Similar patterns were observed in ELSA and HRS and there was no
moderation by country among women.
Among women in both ELSA and HRS there was not as much variation in grip strength
among the different marital statuses as among men. There was some moderation in the associ-
ation by gender between marital status and grip strength for those who were widowed, never
married and remarried. Remarried men had relatively stronger grip strength than remarried
women, whilst widowed and never married women had relatively stronger grip strength than
their male counterparts.

 slower walking speed than men who were in their first marriage, in both surveys. The slower
walking speed among divorced men was explained by the socioeconomic measures (model 2),
primarily wealth. Among widowed men in both samples and never married men in ELSA, the
socioeconomic measures (model 2) only partly attenuated their slower walking speed and
adjustment for health behaviours, physical health and mental health did little to attenuate this
further (model 3). There was no evidence that the association between marital status and walk-
ing speed was different for men in ELSA to those in HRS.
Women.
Among women the demographic adjusted model (model 1) showed that unmar-
ried women in both ELSA and HRS had a slower walking speed than women in their first mar-
riage (Table 5), and the addition of the socioeconomic measures (model 2), primarily wealth,
attenuated this association. There was no evidence that the association between walking speed
and marital status was different for women in ELSA than in HRS, and there was no evidence
that the association was moderated by gender in either ELSA or HRS.
Discussion
Using nationally representative data from two surveys of older people in England and the
USA, an association was found between marriage and physical capability at mid to later life,
with those who were unmarried displaying poorer physical capability than their counterparts
who had remained in their first marriage. Our findings reinforce those from two existing stud-
ies, which also investigated the relationship between marital status and the performance-based
measures of physical capability [23] [24], as we too found that never married men and wid-
owed men and women had poorer physical capability than their married counterparts. Our
findings also echo the findings from other research which have used the self-reported measures
of physical capability [21] [22]. Much of the association was explained by the greater wealth of
married people. Previous research has shown a strong association between marriage and

 wealth [46] [47] and between wealth and physical capability [48] [49], and this research shows
that the greater economic resources associated with marriage are important for physical
capability.
There was found to be some moderation in the association by gender, but only for the mea-
sure of grip strength. Being widowed or never married was associated with relatively weaker
grip strength for men than for women, whilst remarriage for men was associated with rela-
tively stronger grip strength than it was for women. Other studies have also found gender dif-
ferences in the association, particularly among those who are never married [23]. However,
our study extends on previous research by showing that there are differences in physical capa-
bility between those in a first marriage and those who are remarried.
These gender differences and the relative advantage of remarried men compared to men in
their first marriage in the measure of grip strength could possibly be explained by gender spe-
cific selective factors into marriage, for instance men who are more muscular and stronger
may be more likely to be selected into marriage in the first instance and then back into mar-
riage after a marital transition. There were no such gender differences in the association
between marital status and walking speed, which could be because walking speed is not so reli-
ant upon muscle mass as grip strength [13].
The relative physical capability advantage of remarried men compared to men who have
remained in their first marriage is in contrast to previous evidence [25]. The differences in
findings could be due to the different measure of physical capability that were utilised, as the
previous study used self-reported mobility to measure physical capability. More evidence is
needed on remarriage and physical capability to determine the association.
Widowed and never married men had slower walking speeds than men in their first mar-
riage, an association which remained after adjusting for all covariates. Prior research has also
found widowed and never married men to have particularly poor physical capability compared
to their married counterparts, but the association has yet to be fully explained [50] [51] [23]. It

 is possible that in this analysis we have not captured all the explanatory pathways linking mar-
riage to physical capability. In particular, married men most commonly nominate their spouse
or partner as their closest person providing social support [52] [53] and social support has
been linked to physical capability [54] [55], although the evidence is inconsistent [56]. Consid-
eration of social support was beyond the scope of the current study, but it could be important
to consider in future work aiming to understand the link between marriage and physical
capability.
There was consistency in the association of marital status with physical capability between
England and the USA, which shows that the association is robust and not moderated by
national context in this instance. This could be because England and the USA have similar cul-
tures and social attitudes and further research may show differences between countries that
have very different attitudes and social norms surrounding marriage.
There are a number of strengths and limitations to this analysis. A key strength is that it
used two large comparable nationally representative datasets to investigate marriage and phys-
ical capability in an international context and sheds some light on this little researched area.
The study also used the performance-based measures of physical capability, which are more
accurate for international research as they are less prone to distortion by cultural and educa-
tional differences associated with the self-reported measures [34]. The analysis was carried out
only on cases with complete data, which may have resulted in the analytical sample being
biased. Where there were differences with the full sample, the unmarried participants with
complete data had better physical capability than those who were excluded from the analyses.
Thus we may have underestimated the physical capability disadvantage of being unmarried
(see S2 File).
We were also limited by the lack of ethnic diversity within the ELSA sample and conse-
quently we could not investigate ethnic differences in the association between marriage and
physical capability (although we did adjust for ethnicity in the analysis). We note that marriage
is experienced differently amongst various ethnic groups [57] and that further research looking
into associations between marriage and physical capability within ethnic groups would be of
value.
Given the association between marital status and physical capability, more people entering
older ages never married, or having experienced a transition out of marriage could potentially
mean more people experiencing poorer physical capability at older ages. The importance of
wealth in explaining much of the poorer physical capability among older unmarried people
suggests that increases in access to economic resources available to unmarried people may
help to maintain physical capability and independent living at older ages.
