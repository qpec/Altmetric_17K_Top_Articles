Abstract
Traditional treatments for breast cancer fail to address therapy-
resistant cancer stem–like cells that have been characterized by
changes in epigenetic regulators such as the lysine demethylase
KDM4. Here, we describe an orally available, selective and potent
KDM4 inhibitor (QC6352) with unique preclinical characteris-
tics. To assess the antitumor properties of QC6352, we established
a method to isolate and propagate breast cancer stem–like cells
(BCSC) from individual triple-negative tumors resected from
patients after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Limiting-dilution
orthotopic xenografts of these BCSCs regenerated original
patient tumor histology and gene expression. QC6352 blocked
BCSC proliferation, sphere formation, and xenograft tumor
formation. QC6352 also abrogated expression of EGFR, which
drives the growth of therapy-resistant triple-negative breast
cancer cells. Our findings validate a unique BCSC culture
system for drug screening and offer preclinical proof of concept
for KDM4 inhibition as a new strategy to treat triple-negative
breast cancer. Cancer Res; 77(21); 5900–12. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among
women worldwide (1). Among the subtypes of breast cancer,
triple-negative disease is associated with a particularly poor prog-
nosis and limited therapeutic options (2). During breast cancer
treatment, therapy resistance and metastatic dissemination are the
main problems that have to be faced (1). Of note, breast cancer
stem cells (BCSC) have been suggested to be responsible for both
therapy resistance and metastatic dissemination (3, 4). Until now,
these resistant cancer stem cell populations have only been poorly
characterized and targeted therapeutics have yet to be identified.
It has been shown that alterations of epigenetic regulators such
as the KDM4 family members control tumor cell proliferation
particularly in aggressive breast cancers (5) and dysregulation of
KDM4 demethylases has been documented in a variety of cancers
including breast cancer (6). The KDM4 subfamily is comprised of
KDM4A, B, C, and D and belongs to the Jumonji C (JmjC)
domain-containing family of histone demethylases (7). KDM4
demethylases catalyze removal of the repressive H3K9me3 mark
and that of H3K36me3, a mark linked to transcriptional elonga-
tion (8), thereby regulating a range of crucial pathways. These
findings highlight KDM4 demethylases as potential therapeutic
targets for breast cancer treatment. Consequently, we set out to test
potent and selective drug-like KDM4 inhibitors. In order to
validate inhibitors on cancer stem cells (CSC) from triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC), we established an efficient three-dimen-
sional (3D) cultivation method allowing for growth of CSCs from
patient tumor tissue without prior fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) or murine xenografts to enrich for CSCs. We used
defined conditions including a serum-free culture medium, a rho
kinase inhibitor, Matrigel, and a low oxygen environment to
isolate and enrich for BCSCs from individual patient tumors after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

 tissue specimens for BCSC isolation and paraffin embedding were
obtained from pathologists of the tumor bank of the Compre-
hensive Cancer Centre Freiburg. All experiments were performed
in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. We confirm that
all experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional
Review Board in the Ethics vote 307/13 (independent Ethics
Committee University of Freiburg). Written informed consent
was obtained from each patient.
BCSC isolation method
All primary breast cancer tumors were collected from indivi-
duals who had received chemotherapy and were classified as
triple-negative. Primary BCSC lines were isolated by mechanical
dissociation of the tumor material followed by enzymatic diges-
tion in 5 mL DPBS (Gibco) supplemented with 6 units DNAse I
(Machery-Nagel) and 1 mg liberase (Roche) for 1 h at 37�C.
Afterward, the digestion medium was diluted with 10 mL DPBS
and filtered through a cell strainer (40 mm, BD). Following
centrifugation at 200 �g for 5 minutes, the supernatant was
discarded and the cell pellet was washed with MEBM (Gibco).
Subsequently, if red blood cells were visible in the pellet, 2 mL
ACK Lysis-buffer (Gibco) was added to the cell pellet. After
1 minute of incubation at room temperature, the suspension was
filled up to 6 mL with MEBM and centrifuged at 200 �g for
5 minutes. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was
resuspended in 1 mL MEBM and filtered through a 40-mm strainer.
Following centrifugation at 200 �g for 5 minutes, the supernatant
was discarded and the remaining cell pellet suspended in MSC
medium. Isolated cells were counted and 2 � 104 cells in 200 mL of
a 1:1 mixture of MSC medium and Matrigel (ice cold, Corning,
354230) were plated per well in a 24-well low attachment plate
(Corning). After solidification of the Matrigel at 37�C for 30 min-
utes, each well was topped up with 500 mL of MSC medium. The
cells were cultured at 37�C under low oxygen conditions (3% O2,
5% CO2, 92% N2). 3D cells stably proliferating cells were cultured
and expanded in 2D. All primary BCSC lines were isolated in 2014
and authenticated by the high-throughput Multiplex human cell
authentification test (MCA) developed at the DKFZ in 2016 (9).
Mycoplasma tests were conducted every 3 months via PCR detec-
tion utilizing the positive control provided free of charge by the
Leibniz-Institute DSMZ. Experiments with cells were conducted in
a passaging window of 15 passages.
MSC medium
The mammary stem cell (MSC) medium is composed of
mammary epithelial basal medium (Gibco, 31331-028), supple-
mented with 1 � B27 (Gibco, 17504-044), 1 � amphotericin B
(Sigma-Aldrich,
A2942),
and
1
�
penicillin–streptomycin
(Gibco, 15140122). Furthermore, epidermal growth factor (20
ng/mL, PeproTech, AF-100-15), heparin (4 mg/mL, Sigma-
Aldrich, H3149), fibroblast growth factor (20 ng/mL, PeproTech,
AF-100-18B), gentamicin (35 mg/mL, Gibco, 15750-045), and rho
kinase inhibitor (500 nmol/L, Calbiochem, 555552) were added.
Cell culture
BCSCs were cultured as spheres in a 3D environment as
described above. One milliliter medium was added after 2 days.
Cells were split once a week using Dispase (Corning) to solve
residual Matrigel and Accutase for sphere dissociation. To expand
BCSCs in a 2D environment, 4 � 105 cells were seeded in 2 mL
MSCmediumcontaining2%Matrigel(ice-cold)ina10cmculture
dish.AftersolidificationoftheMatrigelat37�Cfor30minutes,the
dish was topped up with 8 mL of MSC medium. Cells were grown
under low oxygen conditions as described above. Medium was
changed after 3 days. Cells were split once a week.
Anchorage-independent cancer stem cell sphere assay in
methylcellulose
Cells were detached by Accutase and counted. A total of 3 � 103
single BCSC1 and 1 � 103 single BCSC2 cells were seeded into
individual wells of 96-well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning,
3474) in serum-free MSC medium containing 1% methylcellu-
lose (Sigma, M0512). After 7 days, all spheres were counted to
evaluate the sphere-forming capacity except for experiments
including QC6352 treatment, where only spheres over 50-mm
diameter were counted.
Cancer stem cell sphere assay in Matrigel
Cells were detached by Accutase and counted. Single BCSC1
and BCSC2 cells (1 � 103) were seeded as triplicates in 50%
Matrigel into individual wells of 24-well ultra-low attachment
plates (Corning) in serum-free MSC medium. QC6352 and
QC6688 were dissolved in DMSO and paclitaxel in 0.9% saline
solution. After 7 days, spheres over 50 mm diameter were counted
for QC6352- and QC6688-treated and control cells and spheres
over 20 mm diameter were counted for paclitaxel-treated and
control cells. For the assessment of secondary sphere formation,
wells with 4 � 104 single BCSC1 and BCSC2 spheres were seeded
and treated as described above. After 7 days, BCSC1 and BCSC2
cells were split and counted as described above. From these,
1 � 103 single BCSC1 and BCSC2 cells were seeded in triplicates
as described above to assess secondary sphere formation in the
absence of QC6352, QC6688 or paclitaxel. After 7 days, spheres
over 50 mm diameter were counted for QC6352- and QC6688-
treated and control cells, and spheres over 20 mm diameter were
counted for paclitaxel-treated and control cells.
Cell proliferation assay
High titer lentiviral stock (CMV-NLS-mCherry) was obtained
from the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute.
Lentiviral particles were added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI)
of 5 to BCSC1 and BCSC2 in MSC medium. Cells were cultured as
described. For cell proliferation assay, BCSC1mCherry and
BCSC2mCherry were detached by Accutase and counted. 384-
well plates (Greiner, 781091) were coated with 10 mL of MSC
medium containing 2% of Matrigel (Corning, 354230). After
incubation at 37�C for 30 minutes to solidify the Matrigel, 1 �
103 single cells were seeded per well in 384-well. Inhibitor was
added 24 hours later to the indicated final concentrations. Sub-
sequently, daily cell number assessment for the indicated number
of days was performed utilizing the ScanR microscope-based
imaging platform (Olympus) and ScanR software 6. At each time
point, mCherry-positive cell nuclei in 9 sectors of each well were
assessed with a 10� lens..

 KDM4D [Ad-GFP-U6-h-KDM4D-shRNA(#70); #shADV-212848)]
were obtained from Vector BioLabs. Adenoviral particles were
added at an MOI of 300 to BCSC1 cells and MOI of 150 to
BCSC2 cells in MSC medium. Cells were harvested 3 days after
infection for Western blot analyses and after 5 days for Chro-
matin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq analyses. For
cell proliferation assays, BCSC1 were infected with an MOI
of 300. After 5 days, BCSC1 were seeded into 384-well plates
and reinfected with an MOI of 300. To generate xenografts,
BCSC1 were infected with an MOI of 300. After 24 hours,
BCSC1 were detached, reinfected with an MOI of 300 and 1 �
105 cells transplanted into immunocompromised mice as
described below.
ChIP
ChIP experiments were performed essentially as previously
described (10). BCSC1 cells were either cultured for 18 hours in
the absence or presence of 5 � 10�8 mol/L QC6352 or cells were
infected 5 days before harvesting with adenovirus expressing
either shRNA against KDM4A or scrambled control shRNA
(Ad-GFP-U6-hKDM4A-shRNA and Ad-U6-RNAi-GFP, respective-
ly, Vector Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Immunoprecipitation was performed with specific antibodies
(anti-KDM4A (#5766, lot 021110, Schuele Laboratory), anti-
H3K9me3 (Diagenode, #C15410056, lot A1675-001P), anti-
H3 (#ab1791, lot GR300976-1, Abcam), spike-in antibody
(#61686, Active Motif), rIgG (#C15410206, lot RIG001L, Abcam)
in the presence of spike-in chromatin (#53083, Active Motif) on
GammaBind G-Sepharose (GE-Healthcare). For PCR, 2 mL out of
70 mL isolated DNA were used. Primer sequences were as follows:
EGFR 50-cagagctcatcctggccaac-30 and 50-ttctgtctgcacacttggca-30.
Libraries were prepared from immunoprecipitated DNA accord-
ing to standard methods. ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced using
a HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) and mapped to the hg19 reference
genome using bowtie 2 (11). Data were further analyzed with
the peak finding algorithm MACS 1.42 (12) using input as
control. Normalization to spike-in chromatin was performed
according to Ref (13). All peaks with FDR greater than 0.5% were
excluded from further analysis. The uniquely mapped reads were
used to generate the genome-wide intensity profiles, which were
visualized using the IGV genome browser (14). HOMER (15) was
used to annotate peaks, to calculate overlaps between different
peak files, and for motif searches. The genomic features (promot-
er, exon, intron, 30UTR, and intergenic regions) were defined
and calculated using Refseq and HOMER. Data are deposited
under GSE95294.
Orthotopic breast cancer xenografts
All animal studies and experiments were performed in accor-
dance with German Animal Welfare regulations and in accor-
dance with an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee as
described in the animal protocol G13/114. NOD/SCID females
(4–5 weeks old) were anesthetized using an isoflurane inhalator.
A small sagittal incision (no longer than 1.0 cm) on the shaved
and sterilized abdomen allowed access to the mammary gland #4
on both sides. Indicated numbers of BCSCs were mixed with 1 �
106 irradiated fibroblasts [newborn human foreskin fibroblasts
(NuFF), p11, GlobalStem, GSC-3002] and suspended in a 1:1
mixture of Matrigel (Corning, 354230) and MSC medium in a
total volume of 40 mL per gland. The mixture was injected into the
mammary fat pad of the #4 gland on both sides of the animal.
Each transplant was localized distal to the lymph node in the
gland. Surgical incisions were sealed by suturing with a 5/0 thread
(Ethicon, Z995). Animals were monitored twice weekly for weight
and tumor growth, which was determined by caliper measure-
ment. Tumor volumes were calculated using the formula 4/3 � p
� r3.
Ultrasonic 3D tumor model
Ultrasound measurements of xenograft tumors in NOD/SCID
mice were performed using a small animal high-resolution ultra-
sound system (Vevo3100) and transducer (MX550D) with
40 MHz (VisualSonics). For 3D tumor modeling, the transducer
was moved along the tumor automatically with a step size of
0.076 mm. Tumors were visualized with Vevo LAB (Version 1.7.1)
at start and end of treatment.
In vivo treatment with QC6352
Immediately before treatment, QC6352 was dissolved in 50%
polyethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich)/50% DPBS (pH 9, Gibco)
with sonication (Diagenode bioruptor) until a clear solution was
formed. When tumors reached a palpable size of 3 mm3, mice
were treated with vehicle (control) or QC6352. The inhibitor was
administered daily to mice via oral gavage at 10 mg/kg. Control
animals received vehicle only. Animals were monitored twice
weekly for weight and tumor growth.
Dose–response assay
Cells were detached by Accutase, dissociated and counted. The
wells of a black 384-well plate (Greiner) were coated with 10 mL of
MSC medium containing 2% of Matrigel (354230, Corning).
After incubation at 37�C for 30 minutes, to solidify the Matrigel,
1 � 103 single cells were seeded as described above. The inhibitor
was added 24 hours later. Following 96 hours of incubation, cells
were washed with DPBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for
15 minutes at �20�C. Cells were washed with DPBS, stained with
DAPI, and counted using the ScanR microscope-based imaging
platform (Olympus).
Microarray analysis
Total RNA was isolated from patient tumor material, xeno-
grafts, and cells using the Universal RNA Purification Kit (Robok-
lon) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isolated RNAs
were processed with the Ambion WT Expression Kit (Ambion) as
described by the manufacturer and hybridized to Illumina HT-12
v4 Expression Bead Chips following the standard Illumina pro-
tocols. Expression data were processed and quantile normalized
using the R Bioconductor Beadarray package (16) in version 2.22.
Only probesets mapping to an Entrez ID applying the Biocon-
ductor package illuminaHumanv4.db (Version 1.26) were con-
sidered for further downstream analysis. In case of multiple
probesets matching the same Entrez ID, we selected the probeset
having the highest interquartile range across all samples. The
dendrogram depicts a complete-linkage hierarchical clustering
based on the Euclidean distance between the samples. Data are
deposited under GSE95042.
Flow cytometry
To analyze the expression of established CSC markers, cells
were detached and counted as described above. Cells (1 � 105)
were washed with staining buffer (DPBS þ 1% BSA) and stained
for 20 minutes at room temperature in the dark with the following
antibodies diluted in staining buffer: anti-CD24 (eBioscience,

(eBioscience, 46-0495; 1:200). Cells were analyzed using BD LSR
Fortessa and FlowJo software (Version 6).
Immunohistochemistry
Patient tumor tissue specimens were fixed in 10% formalin and
embedded in paraffin. Two-mm-thick paraffin-embedded tissue
sections were mounted onto glass slides. All slides were stored for
two days at 58�C in a drying chamber, subsequently deparaffi-
nized using xylene and hydrated with ethanol. Human and
corresponding xenograft tumor tissue were stained using the
following antibodies: anti-ER (clone EP1, code IR084, Dako);
anti-PR (clone PgR 636, code IR068, Dako); anti-HER2 (code
A0485, Dako); anti-Ki67 (clone MIB-1, code IR626, Dako); anti-
vimentin (clone V9, code IR630, Dako); anti–E-cadherin (clone
NCH-38, code IR059, Dako), and anti-cytokeratin 8/18 (clone
EP17/EP30, code IR094, Dako). For the horseradish-based per-
oxidase detection EnVision Flex Peroxidase-Blocking Reagent
(Dako,
SM801),
EnVision
Flexþ
Rabbit
(LINKER;
Dako,
K8019) or EnVision Flexþ Mouse (LINKER; Dako, K8021) and
EnVision Flex/HRP (Dako, SM802) were used. Counterstaining
was performed with hemalum before adding a coverslip. As
internal positive control, patient-derived physiological mammary
gland was used for ER, PR, Ki67 (nuclear staining), cytokeratin
8/18 and E-cadherin (membranous, cytoplasmic staining).
The mammary gland-surrounding myoepithelial layer was used
as internal control for vimentin. For HER2, tissue specimens
from HER2-positive breast cancer patients (score 3 according to
ref. 17) were included for every HER2 staining session as external
positive control. TNBC was defined as ER-, PR-, and HER2-
negative (score < 2; ref. 18).
Western blot analysis
Experiments were performed as previously described (10). The
following antibodies were used: anti-KDM4A (#5766, lot
021110, Schuele Laboratory), anti-KDM4B (#4662, lot 962009,
Schuele Laboratory), anti-KDM4C (#23855, lot 23062015,
Schuele Laboratory), anti-KDM4D (#ARP35946, lot 001, Aviva
Systems Biology), anti-EGFR (#2232S, lot 16, Cell Signaling
Technology).
RNA preparation and analysis
Cells were cultured in the presence of vehicle or 5 � 10�8 mol/L
QC6352. RNA was isolated as previously described (19). Quan-
titative RT-PCR was performed using the Abgene SYBR Green
PCR Kit (Invitrogen) according to the supplier's protocol. HPRT
was used for normalization. Primer sequences for HPRT were
described previously (20). Other primers were as follows: VCAN:
50-ACTGTGGATGGGGTTGTGTT-30, 50-CTGCGTCACACTGC TC-
AAAT-30; PRR5: 50-CGGGACAAGATTCGCTTCTA-30, 50-AGCG-

TCGGAGATGTTGCTTC-30.
RNA sequencing
BCSC1 cells were cultured for 18 hours in the absence or
presence of 5 � 10�8 mol/L QC6352. RNA was isolated
as described above. RNA samples were sequenced by the
standard Illumina protocol to create raw sequence files (.fastq
files) at the sequencing core facility of the DKFZ. Reads were
aligned to the hg19 build of the human genome using TopHat
version 2 (21). The aligned reads were counted with the homer
software (analyzeRNA) and DEG's were identified using EdgeR
(22). Data are deposited under GSE95294.
Pharmacokinetic analyses
An intravenous dosing solution was made by dissolving
QC6352 into phosphate buffered saline. The pH was adjusted
to 9 by dropwise addition of 1 N NaOH. An oral dosing suspen-
sion was made by dissolving QC6352 into 0.5% methylcellulose.
The intravenous and oral dosing solutions were administered at 5
and 10 mg/kg, respectively, to female CD-1 mice. Pharmacoki-
netic parameters were calculated as the average of groups con-
sisting of three animal.
Statistical analyses
Data are represented as mean and SD or SEM as indicated.
Significance was calculated by a two-tailed Student t test or one-
way ANOVA as indicated with GraphPad Prism Version 6. P values
below 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001 are indicated in figures as �, ��, and
���, respectively.
Determination of the QC6352 IC50
The ability of QC6352 to inhibit the activity of different
KDM family members was determined in 384-well plate format
under the following reaction conditions: 2 nmol/L enzyme,
300 nmol/L H3K9me3, H3K4me3, or H3K36me2 biotin-
labeled peptides (Anaspec), 100 mmol/L alpha-ketoglutaric
acid in assay buffer containing 50 mmol/L HEPES, pH 7.3,
0.005% Brij35, 0.5 mmol/L TCEP, 0.2 mg/mL BSA, 50 mmol/L
sodium L-ascorbate, and 2 mmol/L ammonium iron(II) sulfate.
Reaction product was determined quantitatively by TR-FRET
after the addition of detection reagent phycolink streptavidin-
allophycocyanin (Prozyme) and Europium-anti-H3K9me2,
H4K4me2, or H3K36me1 antibody (PerkinElmer) in the pres-
ence of 5 mmol/L EDTA in LANCE detection buffer (PerkinEl-
mer) at a final concentration of 50 nmol/L and 1 nmol/L,
respectively. To initiate the assay reaction, 2 mL of 6 nmol/L
enzyme and 2 mL of 11-point serially diluted QC6352 in 3%
DMSO were added to each well for 60 minutes, followed by the
addition of 2 mL of a mixture of 900 nmol/L biotin labeled
peptide and 300 mmol/L a-ketoglutaric acid. After incubation at
room temperature for 20 minutes, the reaction was terminated
by addition of 6 mL of 5 mmol/L EDTA in LANCE detection
buffer containing 100 nmol/L Phycolink streptavidin-allophy-
cocyanin and 2 nmol/L europium-labeled antibody. After
60 minutes of incubation at room temperature, plates were
read by EnVisionMultilabel Reader in TR-FRET mode (excita-
tion at 320 nm, emission at 615 and 665 nm). A ratio was
calculated (665/615) for each well and fitted to determine
inhibition constant (IC50).
Results

 (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)
proteins. BCSCs could be cultivated in a 2D and 3D environment
and grow as epithelial clusters and spheres, respectively (Fig. 1A
and Supplementary Fig. S1A). In vitro clonogenic assays such as
sphere formation assays have been developed to study prolifer-
ation, self-renewal, and differentiation of cell populations at the
single-cell level (23). Thus, to verify their stem cell potential
BCSC1 and BCSC2 were challenged in an anchorage-independent
growth assay. BCSC1 and BCSC2 demonstrated a sphere-forming
capacity of 10.8% and 16.2%, respectively, providing evidence for
the potential of BCSC1 and BCSC2 to self-renew (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Fig. S1B). CSCs from breast cancer have been
described to express specific surface markers such as CD49f,
EpCAM, and CD44 while lacking expression of CD24 (24, 25).
We analyzed BCSC1 and BCSC2 for these stem cell markers and
found 58% CD24�/CD44þ and 96% EpCAMþ/CD49fþ cells in
BCSC1 and 5% CD24�/CD44þ and 97% EpCAMþ/CD49fþ cells
in BCSC2 (Fig. 1C and D; Supplementary Fig. S1C and S1D). The
flow-cytometric analysis clearly showed that BCSC1 and BCSC2
harbor a stem cell population. To further corroborate the stem cell
potential of the BCSCs we performed limiting dilution orthotopic
xenografts in immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice, the cur-
rent gold standard assay for self-renewing CSCs. As few as 1 � 103
BCSC1 and BCSC2 were able to form tumors demonstrating that
both cell lines contain tumorigenic CSCs (Fig. 1E and F; Supple-
mentary Fig. S1E). In summary, we used three independent
methods namely sphere formation, flow cytometry analysis, and
xenografts to demonstrate stemness, self-renewal capacity, and
tumorigenicity of BCSC1 and BCSC2.
To further address the ability of these cells to regenerate the
original patient tumor in a xenograft tumor model we analyzed
tumors derived from BCSC1 and BCSC2 transplants histologically
and genetically. Immunohistochemical analyses of BCSC1 and
BCSC2 xenograft tumors using the mammary epithelial marker
cytokeratin 8/18, E-cadherin, and vimentin as well as the prolif-
eration marker Ki67 indicated that the xenograft tumors share a
similar pattern with their parental patient tumors (Fig. 1G and
Supplementary Fig. S1F). Matching the parental tumor, the
BCSC xenografts were devoid of ER, PR, and HER2 protein
expression (Table 1, Fig. 1H, and Supplementary Fig. S1G). Un-
supervised hierarchical clustering analysis of RNA microarray
data showed that the BCSC tumor xenografts share a close
expression profile with the parental patient tumors, indicating
preservation of the respective molecular tumor subtype (Fig. 1I).
BCSC lines clustered within the corresponding host tumor and
xenograft subtype depicting a close correlation between the
three entities (Fig. 1I). Taken together, our data demonstrate
that BCSCs can be isolated from TNBC patient tissue using
optimized culture conditions and faithfully recapitulate the
patient tumor in xenografts.
KDM4A controls proliferation and xenograft tumor growth of
BCSC1
To evaluate the expression levels of the KDM4 family members
in BCSC1 and BCSC2 we performed Western blot analysis. As
shown in Fig. 2A, we detected robust expression of KDM4A in
both BCSC1 and BCSC2. In contrast, expression levels of KDM4B,
C, and D were more heterogeneous (Fig. 2A). To see whether
KDM4s control proliferation of BCSC1 we performed adenoviral
shRNA-mediated knockdown of KDM4A, B, C, and D in BCSC1
and monitored proliferation in real time. As shown in Fig. 2B,

Next, we wondered whether knockdown of KDM4A affects
growth of BCSC1 xenografts. Therefore, BCSC1 were infected

fat pads of immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice. Importantly,
upon knockdown of KDM4A, tumor growth, and final tumor
weight of the BCSC1-derived xenografts was strongly reduced
(Fig. 2C–E). In contrast, the control knockdown of KDM4D
(shRNA KDM4D) in BCSC1 did not significantly affect tumor
growth and final tumor weight of the xenografts (Supplementary
Fig. S2F–S2H). Together, our data demonstrate that the histone
demethylase KDM4A controls proliferation and xenograft tumor
growth of BCSC1. Furthermore, our bioinformatic analyses indi-
cate that relapse-free survival over time decreases for patients
with TNBC that express high levels of KDM4A in comparison to
patients with TNBC that express low levels of KDM4A (Supple-
mentary Fig. S2I). These findings indicate that targeting KDM4
might be a therapeutic option to limit expansion of BCSC
populations.
QC6352 is a potent KDM4 inhibitor that blocks proliferation of
BCSCs
Based on our observations that KDM4A controls proliferation
and xenograft tumor growth of BCSC1 we decided to test whether
the drug-like KDM4 inhibitor QC6352 (also called compound 6;
ref. 26) might qualify for the treatment of BCSC-originating
tumors (Fig. 3A). As a first step, prior to any investigation of
either biological function or underpinning mechanism of action,
we assessed the selectivity profile of the inhibitor. QC6352 was

 evaluated against the KDM4 subfamily and other JmjC domain-
containing histone demethylases such as KDM2A, 2B, 5B, 6A, and
6B. QC6352 inhibited the demethylase activity of KDM4A, B, C,
and D at nanomolar concentrations with IC50 values between 35
and 104 nmol/L (Fig. 3B). QC6352 showed 100-to 300-fold
selectivity over KDM2 and KDM6 demethylases and only weak
inhibition of KDM5B (Fig. 3B). Finally, QC6352's favorable
pharmacokinetic properties warranted further invivo investigation
(Fig. 3C). In summary, QC6352 presented as an orally available,
potent, and selective KDM4 inhibitor.
When investigating the in vitro efficacy of QC6352 in BCSCs we
observed that concentrations as low as 10 nmol/L inhibited

 BCSC1 and BCSC2 cell proliferation (Fig. 3D and E; Supplemen-
tary Fig. S3A and S3B). To characterize and define the effect of
QC6352 on stem cell potential (self-renewal and differentiation)
we tested whether QC6352 treatment might interfere with the
sphere-forming capacity of both BCSCs. Consequently, BCSCs
were plated as single cells to ensure clonality and inspected for one
week. In a concentration-dependent manner, QC6352 dramati-
cally reduced the anchorage-independent sphere-forming capac-
ity of BCSC1 and BCSC2 (Fig. 3F and Supplementary Fig. S3C).
We then isolated single cells from 1 week QC6352-treated spheres
and evaluated for anchorage-independent sphere formation in a
secondary assay in the absence of QC6352. Of note, the secondary
sphere-forming capacity was blocked even in the absence of
inhibitor (Fig. 3G and Supplementary Fig. S3D). In contrast, the
differentiation-inducing LSD1 inhibitor QC6688 (27) neither
affected primary nor secondary sphere formation (Supplementary
Fig. S3E and S3F). In addition, chemotherapeutics such as the
taxane paclitaxel impaired proliferation of BCSC1 in primary
sphere formation but did not interfere with stem cell potential
and thus allowed secondary sphere formation (Supplementary
Fig. S3G). Taken together, our data demonstrate that QC6352
blocks proliferation and self-renewal of BCSCs.

 QC6352 targets BCSCs through EGFR regulation
To unravel the molecular mechanism underlying the action of
the inhibitor, we performed transcriptome analyses to identify
genes that were differentially regulated upon QC6352 treatment.
BCSC1 were cultivated in the presence or absence of QC6352 and
subjected to RNA-seq. Our analysis identified a total of 580
differentially regulated genes (Fig. 4A). Among them, 254 were
upregulated and 326 were downregulated (Fig. 4A). To see
whether these genes are direct KDM4A targets, we performed
ChIP-seq in BCSC1 cells with anti-KDM4A antibody. The analysis
shown in Fig. 4B identified 46,822 high confidence KDM4A
peaks. Motif analysis using HOMER indicates enrichment of
FOXA3, FOXL2, FOXA1, FOXP1, or FOXF1 motifs at KDM4A
locations (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Only 3,221 (6.9%) KDM4A
locations were observed in BCSC1 treated with shRNA against
KDM4A, thus confirming specificity of the KDM4A antibody
(Supplementary Fig. S4B). This finding prompted us to intersect
the KDM4A cistrome with the QC6352 transcriptome. Among the
580 differentially regulated genes, KDM4A was present at the
promoter of 258 genes (44%; Fig. 4C). Pathway analysis for these
258 genes revealed that 30 of these genes, including EGFR, belong
to the "EGF receptor signaling pathway" (Fig. 4D). We verified
by qRT-PCR analysis that treatment with QC6352 reduced the
expression levels of genes such as versican (VCAN), proline rich 5
(PRR5), activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), early growth response
1 (EGR1), follistatin (FST), and importantly EGFR (Fig. 4E). EGFR
is an emerging therapeutic target that is associated with poor
clinical outcome of TNBC (28). To unravel the importance of
EGFR signaling in growth of BCSCs we treated BCSC1 and BCSC2
with erlotinib, a specific EGFR inhibitor. Of note, treatment with
erlotinib blocked proliferation of both BCSC1 and BCSC2 (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4C–S4F). Furthermore, stem cell potential mea-
sured by anchorage-independent sphere-forming capacity of both
BCSC1 and BCSC2 was dramatically reduced upon treatment with
erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S4G and S4H). Together, these data
demonstrate that EGFR, at least in part, controls growth and stem
cell potential of BCSCs. As shown by Western blot analysis, the
protein levels of EGFR were reduced in both BCSC1 and BCSC2
upon treatment with QC6352 (Fig. 4F and Supplementary Fig.
S4I). Because EGFR is a direct KDM4A target, we tested whether
knockdown of KDM4A affects EGFR protein levels. As depicted
in Fig. 4G and Supplementary Fig. S4J, shRNA-mediated knock-
down of KDM4A led to reduced levels of EGFR in both BCSC1 and
BCSC2. Of note, knockdown of KDM4B, C, or D in BCSC1 did not
affect the levels of EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S4K–S4M). Taken
together, the data show that EGFR expression in BCSCs is blocked
by QC6352 via inhibition of KDM4A.
Because KDM4A is a demethylase that erases the repressive
H3K9me3 mark, we hypothesized that an increase in H3K9me3
should be observed upon inactivation of KDM4A by QC6352. To
this end, we performed genome-wide ChIP-seq with H3K9me3
antibody in BCSC1 cells that were treated with either vehicle or
QC6352. To allow for normalization of H3K9me3 ChIP-seq tags,
we added spike-in chromatin during the ChIP procedure (13). The
analysis shown in Supplementary Fig. S5A identified 141,722
high confidence H3K9me3 peaks in vehicle-treated cells and

 144,266 peaks in cells treated with QC6352. Importantly, we
observed a global increase of the H3K9me3 reads over the KDM4A
peaks (Fig. 5A). Similarly, on the EGFR promoter we also observed
increased levels of the repressive H3K9me3 mark over the KDM4A
peak subsequent to inactivation by QC6352 (Fig. 5B). To dem-
onstrate that the increase of H3K9me3 levels at the EGFR pro-
moter upon treatment with QC6352 is due to inhibition of
KDM4A, we infected BCSC1 cells with adenovirus encoding either
shRNA control (shRNA Ctrl) or shRNA against KDM4A (shRNA
KDM4A) and performed ChIP assays. ChIP-qPCR analyses indi-
cate that in BCSC1 infected with shRNA KDM4A the levels of
H3K9me3 at the EGFR promoter increase concomitantly to a
decrease in KDM4A when compared to control cells (Fig. 5C). In
summary, these results demonstrate that treatment of BCSCs
with QC6352 targets EGFR via inhibition of the KDM4A demethy-
lase activity.
QC6352 inhibits BCSC-derived xenograft tumor growth
Next, we wondered whether QC6352 might affect growth of
BCSC1 and BCSC2 xenografts. Therefore, 1 � 105 cells were
implanted into the fat pads of immunocompromised NOD/SCID
mice. To mimic the clinical treatment situation of a preexisting
tumor we allowed growth of the xenografts to a size of 3 mm3
before starting treatment. Mice carrying tumors were then treated
with QC6352 for 21 days at 10 mg/kg per os. Importantly,
QC6352 strongly affected tumor growth and final tumor weight
of both BCSC1 and BCSC2 xenografts (Fig. 6A–E and Supple-
mentary Fig. S6A–S6E). Treatment with QC6352 was well toler-
ated and did not affect body weight of the mice (Supplementary
Fig. S6F and S6G). Furthermore, we analyzed whether treatment
with QC6352 affected expression of KDM4A target genes in the
BCSC1 xenograft tumors in a similar manner as observed in cell
culture (Fig. 4E). As displayed in Fig. 6F, expression of VCAN,
PRR5, ATF4, EGR1, FST, and EGFR was similarly affected in
BCSC1 xenograft tumors of QC6352-treated mice as in vitro.
Taken together, our data demonstrate that treatment with the
KDM4 inhibitor QC6352 blocks BCSC xenograft tumor growth.
Discussion
In recent years, CSCs from solid tumors were identified using
surface marker profiles and subsequent limiting dilution ortho-
topic xenografts. The first description of BCSCs by Al-Hajj and
colleagues identified that the BCSC population is marked by

 CD24low/CD44high cells (24). In addition, several other surface
molecules such as CD61, CD49f, and EpCAM identifying BCSCs
were proposed (29, 30). Importantly, due to a lack of appropriate
culture conditions BCSCs cannot be cultivated continuously
in vitro in a stem cell state (31, 32). To address this issue and to
stabilize the CSC phenotype, we used a 3D Matrix and applied a
Rho Kinase inhibitor in a low oxygen environment. Thus, our
culture conditions allowed cultivation of BCSCs directly from the
patient tumor without the need for initial separation of tumor
tissue and CSCs by FACS or the expansion of the patient's tumor
tissue in murine xenografts. Limiting dilution transplants of our
cultivated BCSCs regenerated the original patient's tumor. The
xenograft tumors had an almost identical immunohistochemical
pattern compared with the tumor of origin, which is comparable
to results obtained from direct patient xenografts (24, 33). In
addition, transcriptome analyses uncovered a strong clustering of
primary tumors, xenografts, and cell lines. Thus, BCSCs faithfully
reproduce the original patient's tumor and are therefore an ideal
cellular platform to test novel therapeutics.
Because breast cancer progression was shown to be associated
with alterations of KDM4 demethylase family members (8, 34–
36), we set out to characterize the expression profiles of the four
KDM4 family members, namely KDM4A, B, C, and D in BCSC1
and BCSC2. BCSC1 and BCSC2 are characterized by a robust
expression of KDM4A. In contrast, expression levels of KDM4B, C,
and D were more heterogeneous. While depletion of KDM4A
impaired proliferation of BCSC1 and blocked growth of BCSC1
tumor xenografts, knockdown of the other KDM4 family member
neither affected cell proliferation nor xenograft tumor growth.
These findings are in accordance with previous studies suggesting
that KDM4A controls proliferation of breast cancer cells (37, 38).
Furthermore, by showing for the first time that KDM4A controls
proliferation and self-renewal of BCSCs isolated from chemo-
therapy-resistant
triple-negative
breast
tumors
we
validate
KDM4A as a therapeutic target.
In recent years diverse KDM4 inhibitors have been identified,
which act either as a-ketoglutarate mimics, a cofactor essential for
the enzymatic function of KDM4s, or as inhibitors of the catalytic
site (8). These molecules showed inhibitory effects on KDM4s in
vitro and in cell culture models (8). However, these KDM4 inhi-
bitors did not qualify as therapeutic agents. In contrast, QC6352 is
a drug-like KDM4 inhibitor that is potent, selective, orally avail-
able and presents favorable pharmacokinetic properties.
In summary, we established an advanced culture method that
allows isolation and growth of BCSC lines isolated from individ-
ual patient tumors after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We demon-
strate that BCSC xenografts faithfully recapitulate parental patient
tumors and that BCSCs, BCSC xenografts, and the parental tumors
share a highly similar transcriptome and phenotype profile.
Therefore, our models are ideal tools for the identification and
validation of novel therapeutics. In line with this idea, we iden-
tified the histone demethylase KDM4A as a therapeutic target for
BCSC-originating tumors. Consequently, we showed that the
orally available, potent, and selective KDM4 inhibitor QC6352
abrogates expression of target genes via inhibition of the KDM4A
demethylase activity, thereby blocking proliferation, sphere-
forming capacity in vitro, and xenograft tumor growth of BCSCs
in vivo. Thus, modulation of KDM4 activity is a promising ther-
apeutic strategy for the treatment of TNBC.
