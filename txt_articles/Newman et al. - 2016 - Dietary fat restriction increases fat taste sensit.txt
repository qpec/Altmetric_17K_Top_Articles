 Dietary Fat Restriction Increases Fat Taste Sensitivity
in People with Obesity
Lisa P. Newman1, Dieuwerke P. Bolhuis1, Susan J. Torres2, and Russell S.J. Keast1
Objective: Individuals with obesity may be less sensitive to the taste of fat, and it is hypothesized that
this is due to excess dietary fat intake. This study assessed the effect of a 6-week low-fat (LF) or portion
control (PC) diet matched for weight loss on fat taste thresholds, fat perception, and preference in people
with overweight/obesity.
Methods: Participants (n 5 53) completed a randomized dietary intervention and consumed either a LF
diet (25% fat) or PC diet (33% fat) for 6 weeks. Fat taste thresholds (lowest detectable fat concentration),
fat perception (discrimination ability), preference, and anthropometry were assessed at baseline and
week 6.
Results: Consumption of a LF diet (n 5 26) and PC diet (n 5 27) reduced participants’ weight (P < 0.001),
with no significant differences between groups (LF
, 22.9%, PC, 22.7%). Both diets resulted in a
decrease in fat taste thresholds (P 5 0.014), and the effect tended to be stronger in the LF diet vs. the
PC diet (P 5 0.060). The ability to perceive different fat concentrations in foods was increased after the
LF diet only (P 5 0.017); however, food preference did not change on either diet.
Conclusions: A PC and LF diet both increase fat taste sensitivity in people with overweight/obesity, with
the strongest effect after the LF diet.

Introduction
Excess fat consumption is a major cause of excess energy intake
and is thus a key contributor to weight gain (1). Identifying potential
mechanisms such as appetite control and food motivation is impor-
tant in understanding how overweight/obesity could be treated and
prevented (2). Recent evidence has suggested that an individual’s
ability to detect fats within the alimentary canal (oral cavity and
gastrointestinal (GI) tract) may be an associative factor for develop-
ment of obesity, with an impaired response to detecting fats being
linked to excess fat consumption (3).
Free fatty acids, the breakdown products of dietary fat, are detected
by fatty acid receptors (4) throughout the alimentary canal, specifi-
cally the gustatory system where they contribute to fat taste and the
cephalic response and the GI system where they influence gut motil-
ity and the hormonal satiety cascade (5). In individuals with obesity,
oral and GI chemoreception of fatty acids is attenuated (5), possibly
predisposing these individuals to high intakes of fatty foods (6).
This is a controversial area, with some studies reporting inverse
relationships between fat taste sensitivity and fat consumption (7-10)
and others not (11,12).
To date, there has been limited research investigating the modula-
tion of fat taste sensitivity via dietary changes. Hypothetically, an
individual
following
a
low-fat
(LF)
diet
would
experience
increased chemoreception for fatty acids throughout the alimentary
canal, which may in turn help to maintain long-term fat and energy
intake reduction (Figure 1). Conversely, it would be expected that
an individual who did not modify their fat intake would not experi-
ence changes to their fat taste sensitivity. The aim of this study
was to assess the effect of a short-term weight-loss LF diet versus
a short-term weight-loss portion control (PC) diet on fat taste
thresholds, fat perception, and fat preferences in participants with
overweight/obesity.

 Methods
Participants
A power calculation was conducted to determine an appropriate
sample size for the study. Using data from a previous study (9), we
expected to detect a threshold difference of 2.2 mM oleic acid
(C18:1) between baseline and week 6. a was set at 95% confidence,
and b at 90% confidence and it was calculated that 26 people per
dietary group were required for the study to have adequate power.
Participants were recruited from the suburbs surrounding Deakin Uni-
versity, Burwood, Victoria, Australia. Participants had to meet the fol-
lowing criteria: body mass index (BMI) > 25 kg/m2, non-smoker and
18-75 years of age. Participants were excluded if they were pregnant
or breastfeeding or had a medical condition that affected their taste or
weight-loss ability. This study was approved by the Deakin University
Human Research Ethics Committee and is registered with the Austra-
lian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR trial number:
ACTRN12611000679987). Written informed consent was obtained
from all participants prior to commencing the study.
Study outline
This study was a randomized dietary intervention where participants
followed one of two weight loss diets: 1) a LF diet (<25% total
energy from fat) or 2) a PC diet (33% total energy from fat, reduc-
tion in total energy by 25%). All participants were required to attend
one laboratory session at baseline and week 6 during which detec-
tion threshold tests for C18:1, sucrose, and NaCl using ascending
forced choice triangle tests; a fat ranking task using custard samples
with varying fat contents; preference ratings for LF and regular-fat
foods; and anthropometric measures, were measured. Participants
were also required to complete a one-day food record at baseline
and weeks 2, 3, 4, and 6 and a food frequency questionnaire at base-
line and week 6 to determine habitual intake and compliance.
Low-fat diet
This 25% energy from fat diet was designed to reduce the consump-
tion of full fat dairy products, fatty meats, baked products, high-fat
spreads, and overall kilojoule intake (13). Dietary counseling was
overseen by the coordinating dietitian and provided by trained
research staff. Participants were given a 30-45 min face-to-face
counseling session at baseline, and a booklet which contained all of
the information needed to follow the diet. To assist with compliance,
participants were given a low-fat margarine (Flora Ultra-Light, Uni-
lever, Epping, Australia), four packets of LF crackers (Sakata Rice
Snacks Australia, Laverton North, Australia), and one packet of pop-
corn kernels (Popping Corn, Riviana Foods, Scoresby, Australia) as
alternatives to high-fat spreads and snack foods. Participants were
also contacted by phone on a weekly basis throughout the interven-
tion to keep participants motivated and accountable.
Portion control diet
The PC diet (33% energy from fat) was designed to decrease partici-
pants’ energy intake by 25%. This diet was based on the Australian
government campaign, “Swap it, don’t stop it,” (14). Participants
were instructed to reduce the consumption of their usual diet. Partic-
ipants had a one-on-one counseling session with trained research
staff, outlining how to reduce their energy intake by 25%. To help
reduce meal sizes, participants were given guidance on the following
four key concepts; (1) use a smaller plate as this makes a little food
seem a lot, (2) eat mindfully by taking time to chew your food prop-
erly and eat slowly (15), (3) avoid activities such as watching televi-
sion or reading while eating as this can distract you from noticing
when you are full, (4) follow the 80% rule which was to stop eating
before you are completely full, which ties in with concept (2) (16).
Participants were also given ideas on how to reduce meal size when
eating out of the home. To aid in compliance, participants were
given a small, appetizer sized plate (23 cm) for all meals (16-18).
Weekly calls were made to those following the PC diet to answer
any questions and to keep participants motivated.
Anthropometry
At baseline, height (m) was measured using a free standing stadiom-
eter. Body weight (kg) (Body Scan Composition Monitor Scales,
Tanita, Cloverdale, Australia), waist and hip circumferences (19)
were measured at baseline and week 6. BMI was calculated
(BMI 5 weight (kg)/height (m2)).
Figure 1 The hypothesized changes to fat taste sensitivity in the oral and GI tract
that may occur when individuals follow a habitual LF diet or high-fat diet. (a) After
habitual consumption of a high-fat diet, it would be expected that fat taste sensitiv-
ity in the oral and GI tract would decrease which would increase the amount of fat
required to elicit a satiety response in the GI tract, therefore increasing total energy
and fat intake and in turn increasing BMI. (b) However, after habitual consumption
of a LF diet, it would be expected that individuals would have an increased sensi-
tivity to fatty acids in the oral and GI tract which would therefore decrease the
amount of fat that is required to elicit satiety responses within the GI tract and in
turn decrease total energy and fat consumption, thus reducing BMI.

 Dietary assessment and compliance
Each participant completed a one-day food record at baseline and
weeks 2, 3, 4, and 6. Participants were asked to, where possible,
weigh the foods they consumed (participants used their own scales)
or use standard metric measuring cups or common serving sizes.
The one-day food records were analyzed using the AUSNUT 2007
food composition database and FoodWorks 2009 software, version 7
(Xyris software, Highgate Hill, Australia). From these data, the
mean energy intake (kJ), macronutrient distribution (% energy from
fat, protein and carbohydrate, and grams of fat, protein and carbohy-
drate), type of fat (grams and % of monounsaturated, polyunsatu-
rated or saturated), and amount of sodium (mg) consumed were
calculated.
Participants were also required to complete a food frequency ques-
tionnaire that recorded how frequently they consumed common
foods identified in the 1995 Australian National Nutrition Survey
over the previous month (20). In total, 120 food items were
assessed. Participants responded on a scale ranging from “never or
less than once a month” to “six or more times per day.” Each fre-
quency category was converted into a daily equivalent value and
then categorized into specific food groups.
C18:1 solutions
C18:1 solutions were prepared as previously outlined by Haryono
et al. (21).
Fat taste thresholds
Fat taste thresholds were determined using triangle tests with ascend-
ing forced choice methodology as described by Haryono et al. (21).
Sucrose and NaCl solutions and detection
thresholds
Solutions were prepared in accordance with the International Orga-
nization for Standardization as outlined by Newman and Keast (22).
Testing for sucrose and NaCl thresholds was conducted using trian-
gle tests with ascending forced choice methodology.
Fat ranking task
Custard samples were prepared according to Stewart et al. (10). Par-
ticipants were asked to rank the four custard samples (0, 2, 6, or
10% fat) in order of perceived fattiness. All participants received a
score out of five for this task (10).
Hedonic ratings
Participants completed a preference test with three sets of regular-fat
and LF foods. Participants were given a variety of different foods
including cream cheese (Philadelphia Spreadable Cream Cheese,
Kraft Foods
Limited, South Wharf, Australia),
vanilla
yogurt
(Yoplait Creamy Vanilla yogurt; National Foods, Docklands, Aus-
tralia), and chocolate mousse (Nestle Chocolate Mousse, Nestle,
Fonterra Brands, Auckland, New Zealand). Liking was measured on
a 9-point hedonic scale ranging from “dislike extremely” to “like
extremely.”
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS version 21 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).
Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to ana-
lyze changes in C18:1, sucrose, and NaCl oral detection thresholds;
hedonic ratings; anthropometric measurements; and dietary intake
from baseline to week 6 with time point as within-subject factors and
dietary intervention (LF or PC) as between-subject factors. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests were used to detect differences in fat ranking scores
from baseline to week 6, and Mann–Whitney U tests were used for
between-group analyses. Paired t-tests were used to establish differen-
ces in taste detection thresholds and in answers to dietary question-
naires from baseline to week 6 (significance was accepted at P < 0.01
for the food frequency data). Data that were not normally distributed
were log-transformed prior to analysis. All values are stated as mean-
6 SEM. Significance was accepted at P < 0.05.
Results
Participants
In total, 53 participants (LF-26, PC-27) completed the study (Figure
2). There were no significant differences between the groups at
baseline for any of the measures (Table 1).
Anthropometry
Consumption of both the LF and PC diets resulted in a significant
reduction in weight (time effect, F(1, 47) 5 51.2, P < 0.001), BMI
Figure 2 Number of participants who were screened and randomized and who com-
pleted the intervention. *These participants were removed as their dietary data did
not meet compliance due to the fact that they had consumed less kilojoules than
required for their basal metabolic rate (BMR). For example, some subjects had
reported consuming 1,500 kJ for a whole day; therefore, these subjects were
removed.

No
significant
differences
between groups were observed for weight loss (P 5 0.262) and
waist–hip ratio (P 5 0.934), but a trend for BMI (P 5 0.069). The
LF diet group reduced weight by 2.9% while the PC group showed
a reduction of 2.7% over the 6-week period. The weight of the two
groups did not differ at week 6 (P 5 0.391) (Table 1).
Dietary compliance
There were no significant differences in total energy or macronu-
trient intake between the two diet groups at baseline (Table 2).
Total energy intake (kJ).
Between baseline and week 6, both
groups
decreased
their
total
energy
intake
(time
effect,
F(1,
42) 5 13.1, P < 0.001). Total energy intake did not differ between
the two diets (P 5 0.676). There were no interaction effects for these
changes (P 5 0.412) (Table 2).
Total fat (g) intake and percentage energy from fat.
Both
groups decreased their total fat intake (g) from baseline to week 6
(time effect, F(1, 42) 5 20.6, P < 0.001) and percentage of energy
derived from fat (time effect, F(1, 42) 5 21.1, P < 0.001 for all)
(Table 2). Total fat intake and fat percentage did not significantly
differ between the two diets (total fat, P 5 0.494; fat percentage,
P 5 0.146). There was no significant interaction between time and
group for total fat (P 5 0.504); however, there was a trend for the
diet groups to differ in percentage energy from fat (time 3 group,
F(1, 42) 5 3.79, P 5 0.058).
Total carbohydrate (g) intake and percentage energy from
carbohydrate.
There was a trend for difference between groups
in carbohydrate intake (P 5 0.077), but no changes over time
(P 5 0.190) and no group by time interactions (P 5 0.306) for total
carbohydrate intake (Table 2). Percentage energy from carbohydrates
increased significantly in both diet groups from baseline to week 6

 (F(1, 42) 5 32.9, P < 0.001) and between groups (F(1, 42) 5 4.79,
P 5 0.034).

(g)
intake
and

from
protein.
Total protein intake significantly decreased in the LF diet
and PC diet groups (time effect, F(1, 42) 5 4.96, P 5 0.031) (Table
2). However, these changes did not differ significantly between
groups (P 5 0.290) and there was no group by time interaction
(P 5 0.095). In addition, for percentage energy from protein, there
was no significant effect of time (P 5 0.204) but a trend for overall
group differences (P 5 0.073), and a significant interaction was
observed (time 3 group, F(1, 42) 5 5.44, P 5 0.025).
Food frequency questionnaire
Low-fat diet.
During the intervention, the LF diet group signifi-
cantly reduced their consumption of fried foods (P 5 0.008). Addi-
tionally, leafy vegetables (P < 0.001) were consumed more fre-
quently at week 6 when compared to baseline.
Portion control diet.
Participants in the PC diet group did not
significantly change their consumption of any of the food categories.
The LF diet group also consumed leafy vegetables (LF: 5.95 times/
day, PC: 4.48 times/day, (P 5 0.007)) on more occasions than the
PC group.
Fat taste thresholds
C18:1 detection thresholds did not differ between the two diet
groups at baseline (Table 1). Consumption of the LF and PC diets
over the 6-week period significantly decreased C18:1 thresholds
(F(1, 46) 5 6.58, P 5 0.014). There was a trend for a difference in
thresholds between groups at week 6 (group effect, F(1, 46) 5 3.71,
P 5 0.060) with the LF group having a greater decrease in thresh-
olds for C18:1. There was no significant interaction effect for group
and time (P 5 0.845).
There were no significant relationships between baseline fat taste
thresholds and energy intake (BL, P 5 0.363; WK6, P 5 0.636), total
fat intake (BL, P 5 0.922; WK6, P 5 0.604), or percentage energy
from fat (BL, P 5 0.340; WK6, P 5 0.652) at baseline or week 6
when groups were combined. A trend was found for a positive rela-
tionship between baseline fat taste threshold and baseline BMI
(P 5 0.068) and a significant positive correlation was found between
fat taste threshold at week 6 and BMI at week 6 (r 5 0.289,
P 5 0.046).
Sucrose and NaCl detection thresholds
There
were
no
significant
differences
in
baseline
sucrose
(P 5 0.627) and NaCl (P 5 0.174) detection thresholds between the
groups (Table 1). Consumption of the LF diet or the PC diet over
the 6-week period had no significant effect on detection thresholds
for sucrose (P 5 0.227) or NaCl (P 5 0.558). No significant effect
was seen for sucrose or NaCl between groups (sucrose, P 5 0.910;
NaCl, P 5 0.208) or time by group interaction (sucrose, P 5 0.738;
NaCl, P 5 0.303).
Fat ranking task
Scores for the fat ranking task at baseline did not differ between
dietary groups (P 5 0.348) (Figure 3). There was a significant
increase in the fat ranking task scores following the consumption of
the LF diet (P 5 0.017) (Figure 3). In contrast, consumption of the
PC diet had no significant effect on fat ranking task scores
(P 5 0.314) (Figure 3).
Hedonic ratings
The LF and PC diet groups did not differ in liking of regular-fat and
LF foods at baseline (Table 3). Following the consumption of the
diets, there was a significant increase in the liking of LF cream
cheese (time effect, F(1, 47) 5 7.02, P 5 0.011). There was also a
significant increase in liking for regular-fat chocolate mousse (group
effect, F(1, 47) 5 4.31, P 5 0.043). No significant time by group
interactions were observed (P > 0.05); however, there was a time by
group interaction for liking of the LF yogurt (time 3 group, F(1,
47) 5 4.48, P 5 0.040).
Discussion
This study compared the effects of a 6-week LF diet versus PC
matched for weight loss on taste detection thresholds for C18:1,
sucrose, and NaCl; and fat perception and hedonic ratings for
regular-fat and LF foods. Fat taste thresholds significantly decreased
(increased sensitivity to fatty acids) in both groups and this decrease
in threshold was specific to fatty acids; thresholds for sucrose and
NaCl did not change. Fat perception, which was measured as the
discrimination ability to rank different fat concentration, signifi-
cantly increased only in the LF diet group.
Fat taste thresholds in both the LF and PC diet groups decreased after
the 6-week diet, with the LF diet group tending to have a larger
decrease in thresholds compared to the PC group (P5 0.060). There
was a trend toward the LF diet consuming a lower percentage from
fat (24.9%) and gram value (41.4 g), compared to the PC group
(29.2%, 47.5 g) (P5 0.058). Given that the LF group trended toward
consuming less percentage energy from fat and also less gram amount

 of fat we cannot identify whether absolute fat intake or percent energy
may be most dominant; but given that there was also a trend for a sig-
nificant difference in percent energy from fat between the two groups
this is worth investigating in a larger study. While significant reduc-
tions in fat taste thresholds were seen in both the LF and PC diet
groups during the intervention, only the LF diet group demonstrated a
significant increase in fat perception, which is similar to previous find-
ings (9). We cannot conclusively state whether fat percentage or
amount is more dominant in increasing fat perception in foods.
Interestingly, no changes in oral detection thresholds for sucrose or
NaCl were seen in both diet groups. These tests were used to control
for potential learning effects that may have occurred from session
one to session two. As there were no changes in oral detection
thresholds corresponding to changes in consumption of sucrose and
sodium from baseline to week 6, it suggests that the decreases in fat
taste threshold were specific to the reduction in fat intake throughout
the 6-week period.
The present study found no relationship between fat taste and fat
intake at baseline or week 6. Previous data surrounding this area is
conflicting, with some studies finding strong associations (8-10), and
others finding no associations (11,12). However, the cross-sectional
nature of data presented in previous studies, rather than data from
intervention studies, may provide insight into these discrepancies. For
instance, if two participants who consume excess dietary fat undergo a
single fat taste determination, one participant’s threshold may be
12 mM and the other 2 mM; this cross-sectional data would show no
correlation between oral sensitivity and fat intake. However, if the
same participants both followed a LF intervention diet, and their
thresholds changed to 6.4 mM and 1 mM respectively, a temporal
association between fat intake and fat taste may be demonstrated. A
recent study has highlighted a potential mechanism by which fat taste
and energy intake are related, such that those with a higher fat taste
threshold consuming significantly more energy after consuming a high
fat meal (3). The implications being that lower sensitivity to fats fails
to activate satiety or fullness signals after consuming a fatty meal.
The primary focus of this study was to assess whether diet modifica-
tion in people with overweight and obesity can modify fat taste
thresholds (8-10). Previous studies have reported that those who
have lower fat taste thresholds also perform better at the fat ranking
task (8,10). This study investigated whether fat ranking performance
could be increased with a change in diet over a 6-week period and
found a significant increase in fat perception after the LF diet only.
This is similar to previous research which reported that fat percep-
tion can be increased after consumption of a LF diet over 4 weeks
(9). Similarly with fat hedonics, we were interested in seeing if lik-
ing for high- or LF foods would change over time. Preference for
some of the LF foods (cream cheese, chocolate mousse) were
increased after consumption of the LF or PC diet; however, the find-
ings across all foods were inconsistent. It could be hypothesized that
a LF diet would need to be consumed over a longer period of time
before definitive changes in hedonic would be seen.
The present study found a positive relationship between BMI and
fat taste thresholds at week 6 for both groups combined, such that
those with a higher BMI had higher fat taste thresholds, i.e., they
were less sensitive to fatty acids. Previous research has demon-
strated similar associations between fat taste sensitivity and BMI
(8,10); however, other studies have found no associations (9,23,24).
Perhaps standardizing the diet enabled the relationship to be
revealed, in that the consistency of the short-term diet among partic-
ipants minimized one of the environmental variants determining fat
taste sensitivity. However, such discrepancies in findings should not
be surprising, as obesity is caused by a combination of many differ-
ent genetic and environmental factors.
This study needs to be considered alongside limitations which may
have confounded the results. Dietary adherence is very difficult to
monitor during interventions that continue over many weeks; how-
ever, the significant reduction in weight, BMI, and waist–hip ratio,
along with dietary data suggest that participants adhered to their
allocated diet. Food records were used to provide a snapshot of die-
tary intake pre- and post-intervention; however, they do not neces-
sarily reflect habitual dietary behavior as individuals often alter their
eating patterns to exclude socially undesirable foods which would
include foods high in fat (25). It must also be mentioned that both
the LF and PC groups reduced the amount of fat they were consum-
ing from baseline to week 6. Thus, comparison between the two
groups in regards to changes in fat taste sensitivity must be inter-
preted cautiously as there was only a trend for differences in fat
intake at week 6 between the two groups. In addition, changes in fat
taste sensitivity have yet to be reported independent of weight loss;

 therefore, future research should focus on studies that modulate fat
intake while maintaining weight of participants.
Conclusion
In summary, this study has demonstrated that following either a 6-
week LF diet or PC diet in people with overweight and obesity sig-
nificantly decreased fat taste thresholds, with the strongest effect in
the LF diet. This increase in fat taste sensitivity may help induce a
healthy satiety response to dietary fat.O
