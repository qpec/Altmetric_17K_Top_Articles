BACKGROUND: Clinician bias contributes to healthcare
disparities, and the language used to describe a patient
may reflect that bias. Although medical records are an
integral method of communicating about patients, no
studies have evaluated patient records as a means of
transmitting bias from one clinician to another.
OBJECTIVE: To assess whether stigmatizing language
written in a patient medical record is associated with a
subsequent physician-in-training’s attitudes towards the
patient and clinical decision-making.
DESIGN: Randomized vignette study of two chart notes
employing stigmatizing versus neutral language to de-
scribe the same hypothetical patient, a 28-year-old man
with sickle cell disease.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 413 physicians-in-training:
medical students and residents in internal and emergen-
cy medicine programs at an urban academic medical cen-
ter (54% response rate).
MAIN MEASURES: Attitudes towards the hypothetical
patient using the previously validated Positive Attitudes
towards Sickle Cell Patients Scale (range 7–35) and pain
management decisions (residents only) using two
multiple-choice questions (composite range 2–7
representing intensity of pain treatment).
KEY RESULTS: Exposure to the stigmatizing language
note was associated with more negative attitudes towards
the patient (20.6 stigmatizing vs. 25.6 neutral, p < 0.001).
Furthermore, reading the stigmatizing language note was
associated with less aggressive management of the pa-
tient’s pain (5.56 stigmatizing vs. 6.22 neutral, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Stigmatizing language used in medical
records to describe patients can influence subsequent
physicians-in-training in terms of their attitudes towards
the patient and their medication prescribing behavior.
This is an important and overlooked pathway by which
bias can be propagated from one clinician to another.
Attention to the language used in medical records may
help to promote patient-centered care and to reduce
healthcare disparities for stigmatized populations.

INTRODUCTION
It is well documented that patients are not treated equally in
our healthcare system: some receive poorer quality of
healthcare than others based on their racial/ethnic identity,1–4
independent of social class. Others, such as older adults5,6 and
individuals with low health literacy,7,8 obesity,9,10 and sub-
stance use disorders11 may also be viewed negatively by
health professionals in a way that adversely impacts their
healthcare quality. Implicit bias among clinicians is one factor
that perpetuates these disparities.1,12,13 Implicit bias is the
automatic activation of stereotypes derived from common
cultural experiences, which may override deliberate thought
and influence one’s judgment in unintentional and unrecog-
nized ways,2,14,15 and may affect communication behaviors
and treatment decisions.3,16–18
Clinicians may acquire implicit bias towards patients from
one another when communicating verbally or when writing or
reading medical records; physicians-in-training may absorb
these attitudes as part of the Bhidden curriculum^ of medical
training.19–22 Few studies have examined the medical record
as a mechanism for transmitting bias from one clinician to
another. A recent randomized study demonstrated that physi-
cians who read a vignette with the term Bsubstance abuser^ as
opposed to Bhaving a substance use disorder^ were more
likely to agree that the depicted character was personally
culpable and should have punitive measures taken against him
or her.11 Those participants were also less likely to agree with
the notion that a Bsubstance abuser^ needed treatment as
compared to a person Bwith substance use disorder.^23
In this study, we explored whether stigmatizing language
written in a patient medical record was associated with a
subsequent physician-in-training’s attitudes towards the pa-
tient and clinical decision-making. We hypothesized that

 resident physicians and medical students who read a chart note
using stigmatizing language to describe a patient would have
more negative attitudes about the patient and would treat the
patient’s pain less aggressively than those who read a chart
note using neutral language.
METHODS
We employed an experimental vignette study design in which
residents and medical students were randomized to read one of
two chart notes presenting medically identical information
about a hypothetical patient with sickle cell disease (SCD).
The first chart note utilized stigmatizing language and details;
the second used neutral language. After reading the chart note,
participants completed a survey assessing their attitudes re-
garding the patient (residents and students) and treatment
decisions (residents only) for the patient. We focused on a
patient with SCD, as there is significant evidence that these
patients are stigmatized by clinicians and experience inade-
quate pain management, conflicts with staff, and lack of
respect.24 We decided to focus on medical students and resi-
dents, as training is a time of socialization through the Bhidden
curriculum^19 and thus a potential point of intervention. We
selected residents in emergency medicine and internal medi-
cine because they care for patients with SCD presenting with
pain crises. Hypothetical chart notes were used because vi-
gnettes are a robust and efficient method to systematically
assess variation in opinion and decision-making, without con-
founding by other patient characteristics.25,26 All research
activities were approved by the academic medical center’s
institutional review board.
Study Setting and Sample
The study was performed at a large, urban academic medical
center. Residents in the medical center’s two internal medicine
(IM) programs and one emergency medicine (EM) program
were recruited via emails cosigned by their program directors.
Medical students were recruited with an email from a student
on the study team, cosigned by the principal investigator. The
survey was administered online via Qualtrics, which random-
ized participants to the stigmatizing language or neutral lan-
guage arm of the study. As incentive for their participation,
residents were given $25 gift cards. Medical students were
entered into a lottery for one of five $100 gift cards. Two
reminders were sent via email at 10-day intervals.
Survey Vignettes
Two vignettes were created by the study team, written in the
format of chart notes. The vignette describes Mr. R, a hypo-
thetical 28-year-old man with SCD who presents to the emer-
gency department (ED) with a vaso-occlusive crisis. In
Section 1 of the vignette, the admitting physician describes
Mr. R’s chief complaint, history of present illness, and
physical exam findings. In Section 2, a nurse documents
information about Mr. R from an hour later. The chart notes
are shown in Table 1.
The two chart notes differed in the use of stigmatizing
versus neutral language. The stigmatizing chart note was a
written composite based on text abstracted from medical re-
cords from the same medical center.27 We defined stigma after
Bruce Link and Jo Phelan, who conceptualize stigma as ele-
ments of labeling, stereotyping, separating, status loss, and
discrimination co-occurring in a power situation that allows
these processes to unfold.28 Stigmatizing language in patient
charts was characterized by three linguistic features, as elabo-
rated in prior work27: casting doubt on the patient’s pain (e.g.

Section 1
Mr. R is a 28-year old man with
sickle cell disease and chronic left
hip osteomyelitis who comes to
the ED with 10/10 pain in his
arms and legs. He has about 8–10
pain crises per year, for which he
typically requires opioid pain
medication in the ED. At home,
he takes 100 mg OxyContin BID
and oxycodone 5 mg for break-
through pain. Over the past few
days, he has taken 2 tabs every 4–
6 hours. About 3 months ago, he
moved to a new apartment and
now has to wheel himself in a
manual wheelchair up 3 blocks
from the bus stop.
He spent yesterday afternoon with
friends and wheeled himself
around more than usual, which
caused dehydration due to the
heat. He believes that this, along
with recent stress, precipitated his
current crisis. The pain is aching
in quality, severe (10/10), and not
alleviated by his home pain
medication regimen.
On physical exam, he is in
obvious distress. He has no fever
and his pulse ox is 96% on RA.
The rest of the physical exam is
normal other than tenderness to
palpation on the left hip.

patient with chronic left hip oste-
omyelitis who comes to the ED
stating he has 10/10 pain Ball up
in my arms and legs.^ He is
narcotic dependent and in our ED
frequently. At home he reportedly
takes 100 mg OxyContin BID and
oxycodone 5 mg for breakthrough
pain. Over the past few days, he
says that he has taken 2 tabs every
4–6 hours. About 3 months ago,
patient states that the housing
authority moved him to a new
neighborhood and he now has to
wheel himself in a manual wheel-
chair up 3 blocks from the bus
stop.
Yesterday afternoon, he was
hanging out with friends outside
McDonald’s where he wheeled
himself around more than usual
and got dehydrated due to the
heat. He believes that this, along
with some Bstressful situations,^
has precipitated his current crisis.
Pain is aching in quality, severe
(10/10), and has not been helped
by any of the narcotic medications
he says he has already taken.
On physical exam, he appears to
be in distress. He has no fever and
his pulse ox is 96% on RA. The
rest of the physical exam is
normal although he reports
tenderness to palpation on the left
hip.

arousable and seems distressed.
He is not tolerating the oxygen
mask and still has 10/10 pain. His

 insisting that his pain is Bstill a 10^ vs. still has 10/10 pain),
portraying the patient negatively (with irrelevant or unneces-
sary indicators of lower socioeconomic status such as hanging
out with friends outside McDonald’s), and implying patient
responsibility with references to uncooperativeness (e.g. he
refuses his oxygen mask vs. he is not tolerating the oxygen
mask). In addition, we included linguistic variations such as
using the term Bnarcotic^ in the stigmatizing chart note vs.
Bopioid^ in the neutral note. The neutral chart note was written
by the study team to serve as a comparison against the stig-
matizing language note, while remaining realistic.
The survey was reviewed, piloted by members of the study
team and ten medical students, and revised based on feedback.
Pilot data responses were not included in the final data set.
Primary Outcomes
Pain Management Intensity. After reading Section 1,
residents were asked to choose among four options for pain
medication dosing (ketorolac 60 mg IM; morphine 4 mg IV;
hydromorphone 1 mg IV; hydromorphone 4 mg IV). They
were then presented with Section 2 and asked how they would
adjust their management plan (change to oral pain medication
and discharge; give second dose of IV medication; increase
dose of IV medication; tell patient it is too early for additional
opioids and offer ketorolac). The two medication management
questions were combined (and the options for morphine 4 mg
IV and hydromorphone 1 mg IV collapsed based on clinical
equivalence) to yield a score from 2 to 7, with higher scores
indicating more aggressive pain management. Medical
students read both sections of the chart note at the same time
and did not answer the pain management questions.
Attitudes towards the Patient. All study participants
completed an abbreviated Positive Attitudes towards Sickle
Cell Patients Scale (PASS).24 Seven of the 10 items of the
PASS were utilized to directly assess attitudes towards the
hypothetical patient, using a five-point Likert scale for a total
score range of 7–35, with higher scores representing more
positive attitudes. Because the PASS was developed as a scale
to measure attitudes towards actual patients rather than hypo-
thetical patients, we did not view the remaining three items
(which ask the respondent to indicate how much they respect,
empathize, and like the patient) as adaptable to the vignette
scenario.
Secondary Outcome
Perceptions of Vignette Physician Attitudes. To assess
whether participants perceived bias within the note, the other
three PASS items were modified to ask the participant to rate
how much the admitting physician liked, respected, and
empathized with the patient described (vs. participants rating
their own attitudes towards the patient). These three questions
were combined into a score ranging from 3 to 15, with higher
scores indicating that the respondent perceived more positive
attitudes by the admitting physician towards the patient. After
these questions, and without the possibility of returning to
change their answer, an additional, open-ended question asked
the respondent to indicate what features of the note might
convey positive or negative attitudes towards the patient.
Other Predictor Variables
Comfort in Dosing Pain Medication. The residents rated their
comfort in dosing pain medication on a scale from 1 to 10,
with a higher score representing greater comfort.
Demographics. We collected information from respondents
about their year of training (in medical school or residency),
residency type (IM vs. EM), gender, race, and ethnicity.
Statistical Analysis
We used chi-square analyses to compare characteristics of
respondents between the two study arms. After noting no
significant differences, we used t tests (for pain management
intensity, normally distributed) and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests
(for attitudes towards patients, not normally distributed) to
calculate differences between arms.
We conducted several secondary analyses. We performed t
tests to assess potential differences between students and
residents, between black and non-black respondents, and be-
tween EM and IM residents in attitudes towards the patient. To
evaluate whether residents who were more comfortable dosing
pain medication chose more aggressive pain management, we
performed a linear regression between the medication score
and comfort score among all residents and among residents
within each study arm. Finally, we explored respondents’
perceptions of bias on the part of the (hypothetical) admitting
physician using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test to calculate the
difference in the three-item attitude score—how much respon-
dents perceived that the admitting physician liked and had
respect and empathy for the patient—between the stigmatizing
and neutral language chart notes. We explored and described
the reasons given in the open-ended comments.

 characteristics including year of training, ethnicity, gender,
and race were balanced between study arms (Table 2).
Impact of the Stigmatizing Language Chart
Note on Attitudes and Pain Management
Differences in attitudes and pain management intensity be-
tween arms are shown in Figure 1a and b. Exposure to the
stigmatizing language chart note negatively influenced resi-
dent and medical student attitudes towards the hypothetical
patient as measured by the PASS scores: all respondents (20.3
stigmatizing language vs. 25.1 neutral language, p < 0.001;
Fig. 1a). This was true of medical students (21.6 stigmatizing
vs. 26.6 neutral, p < 0.001) and residents (18.7 stigmatizing vs.
23.0 neutral, p < 0.001).
Resident physicians who read the stigmatizing language
chart note prescribed pain medication less aggressively than
those who read the neutral language chart note (4.7 vs. 5.3,
p < 0.001; Fig. 1b).
Additional Predictors of Respondent Attitudes
Residents’ attitudes towards the hypothetical patient were
more negative than those of medical students, regardless of
study arm (PASS score 20.8 residents vs. 24.2 medical stu-
dents, p < 0.001), and there was an inverse correlation between
year of training and PASS score (coefficient −0.95, p < 0.001).
Attitudes towards the patient were more positive among re-
spondents who identified as black than among those who did
not (24.4 vs. 22.5, p = 0.04). There was no difference in PASS
scores between EM and IM residents.
Comfort in Dosing Pain Medication
In respondents exposed to the neutral language chart note,
comfort in dosing pain medication correlated with more ag-
gressive pain management (coefficient 0.09, p = 0.04); how-
ever, this correlation was not present in respondents who read
the stigmatizing language chart note (coefficient 0.03, p =
0.50).
Perceptions of Vignette Physician Attitudes
Respondents who read the stigmatizing language chart note
perceived that the physician who wrote the note had more
negative attitudes towards the patient, relative to those who
read the neutral language chart note (7.6 stigmatizing language
vs. 9.2 neutral language, p < 0.001). The vast majority (88%)
of participants who read the neutral language chart note

 thought the physician had neutral or positive attitudes towards
the patient (score ≥9). Of those who read the stigmatizing
language chart note, only 45% felt the physician had neutral
or positive attitudes towards the patient.
Of the approximately 20 differences between the chart
notes, almost all were highlighted by respondents who read
the stigmatizing language note and perceived that the physi-
cian had negative attitudes towards the patient (score < 9).
Frequencies of each linguistic feature that were mentioned
by at least five respondents are listed in Table 3. Frequently
mentioned phrases among those who read the stigmatizing
chart note and perceived a negative attitude were the words
Bnarcotic dependent^ and Bin our ED frequently,^ as well as
the mention of the girlfriend having shoes on the bed and
requesting a bus token. Those who read the neutral note and
perceived it to be neutral highlighted the fact that the patient
was described as being Bin distress^ and noted that the girl-
friend was by his side.
DISCUSSION
Language may play a powerful role in influencing clinician
attitudes and behavior. Our results suggest that language used
in medical records to describe patients can directly influence
subsequent physicians-in-training who read the notes, in terms
of both their attitudes towards the patient and their medication-
prescribing behavior. This is an important and overlooked
pathway by which bias can be propagated from one clinician
to another, further impairing healthcare quality for the indi-
vidual patient as well as entrenching healthcare disparities
overall for those who are stigmatized.
There is growing evidence that the language used to com-
municate in healthcare reflects and influences clinician atti-
tudes towards their patients.11,23,29,30 Finucane and Carrese
found that residents were more likely to mention black race
(vs. white) when the patient had stereotypically negative be-
havior (e.g. drug use or treatment nonadherence).29 Specific to
SCD, Glassberg et al. found that physicians who use the term
Bsickler^—a term to describe patients with SCD, which is
often considered by patients and clinicians to be
derogatory—have more negative attitudes towards those pa-
tients.30 Our study adds to this compelling literature by
highlighting the important role of language in the medical
record as more than a reflection of attitudes—it is also a means
to transmit these attitudes to others.
We found that residents had more negative attitudes than
medical students towards the patient. It is notable that attitudes
towards patients seem to become more negative as trainees
progress; this may be a manifestation of the ethical erosion
trainees can experience31 as they are influenced by the Bhidden
curriculum^ of observed negative attitudes and behaviors
among their peers and seniors in the clinical setting.19–22 We
also observed that participants who identified as black or
African American had more positive attitudes towards the
patient, affirming prior findings that African American clini-
cians have more positive attitudes towards patients with
SCD.13
While respondents noted a variety of details that led them to
believe that the admitting physician was more or less biased
against the patient, a few themes stood out. Some respondents
commented on the negative impact of irrelevant comments
about behavior and conflicts with the healthcare team, while
others noted the positive impact of including psychosocial
factors and patient beliefs. A noteworthy finding was the
tension in quoting a patient’s own words: some respondents
felt it was an empathetic practice, while others felt quotes were
employed to signal low socioeconomic status or imply facti-
tious histories. The practice of quoting a patient, often encour-
aged in medical education,32,33 deserves a more nuanced
analysis of its potential role in providing information and
nurturing compassion versus stigmatizing a patient and per-
petuating bias. It is remarkable that, when asked to reflect on
the note, many respondents were able to identify potentially
impactful language—even if earlier they had made their own
judgments based on that language. This capacity for reflection
may be a promising point of intervention.
One important issue to consider moving forward is what
should be documented in the medical record. We have shown
that language in medical records may perpetuate bias by
negatively impacting the attitudes and decision-making of

 subsequent physicians-in-training. Yet some of the infor-
mation conveyed in stigmatizing notes—e.g. concerns
about a substance use disorder or nonadherence—is
important to share with members of the healthcare team.
Our study did not aim to address the issue of exactly
what should be written, but to understand and consider
the consequences. Physicians-in-training may feel both
positive and negative emotions about their patients, but
value judgments informed by feelings about a patient
should not appear in the medical record. Clinicians have
a responsibility to record data that are relevant and as
objective as possible, as well as to recognize that using
certain phrases (e.g. substance abuse vs. substance use)
opens the possibility for other clinicians to make or
interpret judgment.
This study has several limitations. First, data collection
occurred at a single center: a large, urban academic medical
center with a significant black patient population. Results may
not be generalizable to other healthcare settings. Second, this
was a vignette study with a defined set of answer choices to
assess attitudes and pain management, so we do not know
exactly how these dynamics may manifest in everyday prac-
tice. However, the attitudinal scale used was previously vali-
dated, and the choices for pain management were made by
physicians with expertise in SCD and emergency and inpatient
medicine. Importantly, all of the stigmatizing language used to
construct the vignette was abstracted from real medical re-
cords, so the vignette chart note represents a realistic portrayal
of how clinicians may communicate with each other in the
medical record. Our chart note had many examples of stigma-
tizing language; thus, the effect may be stronger than typically
seen in a single note.
Finally, the current study did not set out to address
which dimensions of the stigmatizing language were the
most impactful (e.g. casting doubt using quotation marks
vs. blaming the patient for his condition). This was a
proof-of-concept study to demonstrate that the language
we use in medical records impacts physician-in-training
attitudes and decision-making. Future work should evalu-
ate which kinds of stigmatizing language are most likely
to perpetuate bias and adversely affect patient care.
Every encounter with a patient is documented in a chart
note, including patient symptoms and history, objective
signs and results, and the clinician’s assessment and plan
for the patient. For some patients, the medical record may
be the only source of information a new clinician has
about them. We must question the assumption that the
medical record always represents an objective space. Cli-
nicians must be vigilant to guard against contributing to
bias as they write chart notes about their own patients and
as they read chart notes written by others. The language in
medical records should be more carefully considered to
avoid perpetuating clinician biases and the healthcare dis-
parities that may arise from them.
