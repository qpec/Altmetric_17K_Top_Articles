Primary aging is the progressive and inevitable process of bodily deterioration during adulthood. In skeletal
muscle, primary aging causes defective mitochondrial energetics and reduced muscle mass. Secondary
aging refers to additional deleterious structural and functional age-related changes caused by diseases
and lifestyle factors. Secondary aging can exacerbate deficits in mitochondrial function and muscle mass,
concomitant with the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Exercise opposes deleterious ef-
fects of secondary aging by preventing the decline in mitochondrial respiration, mitigating aging-related
loss of muscle mass and enhancing insulin sensitivity. This review focuses on mechanisms by which exercise
promotes ‘‘healthy aging’’ by inducing modifications in skeletal muscle.
Primary versus Secondary Aging: Setting the Stage
Most individuals wishing to be ‘‘forever young’’ dream of a magic
elixir to retard age-related changes in humans. While many have
searched, the proverbial ‘‘fountain of youth’’ has not been found,
and primary aging is unavoidable. Primary aging is the inevitable
deterioration of cellular structure and biological function, indepen-
dent of disease or harmful lifestyle or environmental factors (Hol-
loszy, 2000). Efforts to slow or reverse primary aging have met little
success (Booth et al., 2011). This may partly be related to the pre-
clinicaland clinicalobservationsthatvarious stagesexistalong the
continuum of primary aging. For example, the adaptability or
‘‘plasticity’’ of skeletal muscle of individuals in the age range be-
tween 65 and 75 years is very different than that of individuals
over 75 years. In this regard, we refer to the malleability of skeletal
muscle in terms of insulin sensitivity, ‘‘metabolic flexibility,’’ and
substrate preference in relation to nutrient or exercise challenges,
mitochondrial
function,
and
growth/hypertrophy
response
changes with aging. Overall, the plasticity of aging skeletal muscle
is relatively well preserved up to old age, but wanes significantly in
very advanced age, due at least in part to a diminished upregula-
tion of diverse signaling and gene regulatory pathways necessary
for metabolic and functional adaptations.
Efforts to increase lifespan and, more importantly, quality of life
have been achieved by limiting secondary aging, or more specif-
ically, the deleterious structural and functional changes that are
caused by diseases and environmental factors (Holloszy, 2000).
Thus, lifestyle modifications that promote health, well-being, and
functional capacity minimize disease development and conse-
quently secondary aging. For example, even in the most physically
active people, relative maximal oxygen consumption declines in
the third decade of life due to primary aging, but aerobically active
or sedentary lifestyles can slow or accelerate this, respectively, by
influencing secondary aging (Booth et al., 2011).
Regular exercise training affords protection against the aging-
related changes responsible for development of insulin resis-
tance (Rogers et al., 1990b). Strikingly, physical inactivity and
sedentary behavior have a deleterious effect on human health
that is comparable to smoking (Bouchard et al., 2015). Because
physical inactivity is an important cause of many chronic dis-
eases, it accelerates the secondary aging process and can
lead to premature death (Booth et al., 2012). Thus, physical
activity and prescribed exercise are potent countermeasures
against secondary aging and together play a major role in the
prevention of the most deadly chronic diseases modern humans
face, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic diseases,
cancer, pulmonary diseases, immune dysfunction, musculoskel-
etal disorders, and neurological disorders (Booth et al., 2002).
Not All Activity Is the Same: Distinguishing between
Physical Activity and Exercise
To set the stage for the purpose of this perspective, defining and
distinguishing the differences between physical activity and ex-
ercise is important. ‘‘Physical activity’’ refers to any level of activ-
ity above seated rest that results from skeletal muscle activation
and leads to movement and an increase in energy expenditure,
whereas ‘‘exercise’’ refers to planned, structured, repetitive
1034

 activity aimed to improve fitness (Caspersen et al., 1985). Phys-
ical activity is daily free living activity separate from weekly exer-
cise, whereas exercise training is defined by a prescribed and
adherent dose (i.e., mode, intensity, volume/duration, frequency)
of effort or work.
The extremes of the exercise training continuum can be distin-
guished as endurance or resistance exercise. Endurance exer-
cise of several minutes up to several hours at various intensities
incorporating repetitive, low-resistance load increases aerobic
fitness, partly reflected by a change in skeletal muscle oxidative
capacity and improved function of the cardiovascular system.
Conversely, resistance exercise to increase muscular mass,
strength, and power consists of short-duration activity at high
intensities/resistance or exercises of a single or relatively few
repetitions. In order to achieve measurable functional changes
in work performance, exercise training sessions should be per-
formed three to five times weekly for several weeks. The inten-
sity, duration, and mode of physical activity, and nutritional
status, markedly affect the metabolic and molecular response
to a given exercise challenge (Egan and Zierath, 2013) and in
turn determine the nature of changes in skeletal muscle oxidative
capacity, mass, and strength. When prescribed on a relative
scale (e.g., 70% of maximum), adults of all ages are capable of
exercising at the same intensity after a period of familiarization
and ramping. However, in some older adults the adaptations to
a particular mode of exercise training are blunted compared to
young. This may reflect differences in physiologic reserve
between young and old (e.g., similar resting heart rate, but far
greater heart rate reserve in young).
Fighting Metabolic Disease and Muscle Atrophy:
Warding off Secondary Aging
During the last half century, there has been an explosion in the
diagnosis of a cluster of metabolic disorders, including impaired
glucose tolerance (IGT), obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Strikingly,
a high percentage of individuals with IGT develop type 2 diabetes
within a decade. The majority of people who have IGT or type 2
diabetes are overweight or obese. Both physical inactivity and
aging elevate the risk of type 2 diabetes in ‘‘normal’’ weight
and obese individuals. Moreover, increased sedentary time is
associated with a greater risk for type 2 diabetes and the meta-
bolic syndrome (van der Berg et al., 2016). Conversely, any type
of physical activity is associated with reduced risk of type 2 dia-
betes in adults aged 70 years and over, while in adults in the
50–69 age range, the addition of moderate to vigorous intensity
exercise appears necessary to reduce the risk of developing
type 2 diabetes (Demakakos et al., 2010).
Loss of skeletal muscle mass is one of the most widespread,
deleterious, and insidious processes in aging humans. While
the magnitude varies substantially across individuals, some de-
gree of muscle atrophy impacts all individuals with aging. In 1988
at a meeting in Albuquerque, NM, I.H. Rosenberg first coined the
term ‘‘sarcopenia’’ to describe this age-related loss (penia) of
flesh (sarx) (Rosenberg, 1997). Since then, classifications of
sarcopenia have been proposed based on population variance
in estimates of whole-body lean mass (Janssen et al., 2002,
2004a, 2004b) or limb muscle mass (Baumgartner et al., 1998).
Some of these indices have led to estimates of the attributable
health care burden (Beaudart et al., 2014b; Janssen et al.,
2004b). Despite the original, strict definition of sarcopenia,
more recent classifications have incorporated various indices
of muscle performance (e.g., strength) or mobility function
(e.g., gait speed), apparently in an effort to build clinical rele-
vance and diagnostic criteria. However, the introduction of func-
tional correlates has only confused the diagnosis (Beaudart
et al., 2014a, 2015); thus, we have elected to describe the phe-
nomenon as simply ‘‘aging muscle atrophy.’’
Aging-related defects in mitochondrial energetics have been
proposed to be causally involved in aging muscle atrophy (Gous-
pillou et al., 2014a). These changes are attributed to both inac-
tivity- and age-related alterations in mitochondrial synthesis
and degradation (Carter et al., 2015), indicating a complex path-
ophysiology involving both structural changes to the muscle fi-
bers, as well as the enzymatic machinery that controls glucose
and lipid metabolism. The mitochondrial defect most likely to
impact aging muscle is an increased susceptibility to perme-
ability transition, a likely cause of the increased recruitment of
mitochondrial-mediated pathways of apoptosis (Hepple, 2016).
Metabolic dysfunction and skeletal atrophy of aging develop
over time and slowly, but surely, compromise the quality of life.
Moreover, these conditions place a major burden on society.
The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates there are
415 million adults living with diabetes, mainly in low- and mid-
dle-income countries, and projects this will rise to 642 million
people by 2040 (http://www.diabetesatlas.org). With no cure in
sight, efforts are clearly needed to drive these numbers down.
Aging-related loss of skeletal muscle mass is also exacerbated
indirectly by obesity, with a vicious cycle between an increased
fat mass and the concomitant decrease in skeletal muscle
mass, giving rise to ‘‘sarcopenic obesity’’ (Heber et al., 1996).
Individuals with sarcopenic obesity have increased risk of
adverse health events over and above those who are obese or
sarcopenic
alone
(Cleasby
et
al.,
2016).
Thus,
skeletal
muscle insulin resistance resides at the confluence of age-
related metabolic dysfunction, fat accumulation, and muscle
atrophy.
Loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with aging is also
influenced by sex and hormonal status. For example, the age-
related decline in muscle force is greater for peri-menopausal
and post-menopausal women, and this decline is prevented
by hormone replacement therapy (Phillips et al., 1993). While
women may experience earlier strength losses than men, the
age-related decreases in strength are similar between sexes
when controlling for muscle mass (Goodpaster et al., 2006).
Moreover, this strength decline is more rapid than the concom-
itant loss of muscle mass, suggesting a decline in muscle quality
(Goodpaster et al., 2006). From a public health perspective, loss
of muscle mass not only reduces mobility and functional capac-
ity, but also accelerates obesity and progression toward type 2
diabetes. As the proportion of older inactive adults rises and
the incidence of obesity escalates, this constellation of condi-
tions will collide to have a dramatic impact on the lives of an
increasing number of the world’s citizens.
Today,thereisgrowing appreciationthattype2diabetescanbe
avoided or at least delayed, and aging-related loss of skeletal
muscle mass can be attenuated by lifestyle intervention strate-
gies. Regular exercise counteracts these aging-related diseases.
Endurance exercise incorporating repetitive, low-resistance load

 performed three to five times weekly for several weeks improves
insulin sensitivity and reduces body fat. Resistance exercise
incorporating short-duration activity at high or maximal exercise
intensities and high resistance or exercises of a single or relatively
few repetitions performed three to five times weekly for several
weeks slow the decline in skeletal muscle mass and strength.
Thus, efforts to maintain insulin sensitivity and normal body
weight, as well as maintaining functional skeletal muscle mass,
should be at the forefront of any intervention strategy to achieve
‘‘healthy aging.’’ This review will focus on the effects of exercise
to promote healthy aging through the maintenance of insulin
sensitivity and functional skeletal muscle mass (Figure 1). We
will highlight the current understanding of the key components
of pathways controlling glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial
content/function, as well as mechanisms governing the control
of skeletal muscle mass. Unless otherwise stated, the clinical
studies cited have evaluated the effects of aging and exercise in
non-trained (sedentary) individuals.
Insulin Sensitivity and Aging
Because normal glucose homeostasis is essential for health, it is
troubling that recent analysis of adults in the United States re-
vealed the combined prevalence of diabetes (mostly type 2 dia-
betes), abnormal fasting glycemia, and IGT increased from
20.9% (at 20–39 years) to 46.9% (at 40–59 years) to 67.4% (at
60–74 years) and to 75.6% (at R75 years) (Cowie et al., 2009).
Insulin resistance is linked to many of the most prevalent and
devastating age-related pathologies, including cardiovascular
disease, some cancers, and cognitive dysfunction (Facchini
et al., 2001; Haffner, 1999; Kumari et al., 2000). Whole-body
insulin sensitivity is determined by the integrated actions of mul-
tiple tissues, but skeletal muscle primarily accounts for insulin-
mediated blood glucose clearance (DeFronzo et al., 1981).
Age-related changes in body composition contribute to insulin
resistance observed in older individuals. The accumulation of
abdominal and ectopic fat is associated with the deterioration
in glucoregulation with advancing age (Huffman and Barzilai,
2009; Kohrt et al., 1993). Age-associated muscle atrophy and
changes in muscle quality further contribute to metabolic
dysfunction. Modestly reduced whole-body glucose disposal
has been reported for healthy, older (�65–70 years old) versus
younger (�30 years old) men, even when values are expressed
relative to lean body mass (Fink et al., 1986; Meneilly et al.,
1996; Rowe et al., 1983). Age-related insulin resistance has
been suggested to be independent of primary aging. For
example, similar insulin sensitivity was reported for younger
(35 years old) compared to older (66 years old) individuals who
were matched for exercise training status and body composition
(Amati et al., 2009). Although there is not a consensus regarding
the notion that primary aging induces modest insulin resistance,
it is clear that primary aging per se, independent of age-related
changes in body composition and physical activity, does not
account for the extremely high prevalence of abnormal glucose
homeostasis with advancing age in the United States and
many developed countries. This disturbing situation is largely
attributable to an avoidable condition that is not unique to aging,
and arises from an imbalance between energy expenditure and
energy intake (Figure 2).
Insulin Signaling and Glucose Uptake
Understanding skeletal muscle insulin resistance requires consid-
eration of the insulin signaling pathway regulating glucose trans-
port, beginning with insulin binding to its receptor and resulting
in receptor autophosphorylation and greater tyrosine phosphory-
lation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (Boucher et al.,
2014; Leto and Saltiel, 2012). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS binds
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), facilitating Akt2 phosphory-
lation, which phosphorylates the Rab GTPase TBC1D4 (also

Aging
Endurance exercise enhances muscle insulin sensitivity in older individuals
and prevents declines in mitochondrial respiratory capacity with aging.
Resistance exercise induces remarkable gains in strength and power in older
adults.
Figure 2. Age-Related Changes in Body Composition and Insulin
Sensitivity in Older Individuals Are Influenced by Physical Activity
and Exercise Training
Advancing age is typically characterized by altered body composition
(increased abdominal and ectopic fat accumulation and attenuated mass and
metabolic quality of skeletal muscle) together with reduced physical activity,
leading to insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. These age-related changes
can be exacerbated by lifestyle behaviors that produce a major imbalance
between energy expenditure and energy intake, leading to further dysregula-
tion of glucose metabolism and increasing the likelihood of type 2 diabetes.

 called Akt substrate of 160 kDa or AS160) on multiple Akt Ser/Thr
phosphomotifs, including Thr642 and Ser588, that control the rate
of GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane, resulting in an
increase in glucose uptake.
GLUT4 protein abundance in human muscle has been re-
ported to decline with aging in some, but not all, studies. Vastus
lateralis GLUT4 density in fast-twitch fibers was lower for older
(64 years old) versus younger (29 years old) women and men,
without age-related differences in slow-twitch fibers (Gaster
et al., 2000). Another study including women and men from 18
to 80 years old found a modest negative correlation between
age and vastus lateralis GLUT4 abundance, but not gastrocne-
mius GLUT4 (Houmard et al., 1995). In contrast, other research
found no age-related differences for GLUT4 protein abundance
in the vastus lateralis of young (22–23 years old) versus old
(�60 years old) humans (Cox et al., 1999; Dela et al., 1994).
GLUT4 abundance in various muscles with diverse fiber type
profiles did not differ for rats at 6–12 versus 24–31 months old
(Cartee and Bohn, 1995; Gulve et al., 1993; Sharma et al.,
2010). Thus, reduced GLUT4 abundance seems unlikely to fully
account for age-related insulin resistance.
Defective insulin signaling may contribute to skeletal muscle
insulin resistance. Older (69 years old) versus younger (27 years
old) healthy and normal-weight humans were characterized by
insulin resistance concomitant with reduced insulin-stimulated
Akt2 activity in skeletal muscle (Petersen et al., 2015). Older
women and men (69 years old) versus young (24 years old) con-
trols were modestly insulin resistant, and age was negatively
correlated to TBC1D4 phosphorylation on Ser588 and Thr642 in in-
sulin-stimulated muscle, but not correlated with Akt Ser473 phos-
phorylation (Consitt et al., 2013). These findings are consistent
with the notion that impairments in the insulin signaling cascade
are associated with insulin resistance in aged skeletal muscle.
In rats, there is evidence suggesting muscle-type- and/or fi-
ber-type-selective effects of aging on insulin sensitivity. Insu-
lin-stimulated glucose uptake by the predominantly slow-twitch
soleus was lower for 24-month-old versus 8-month-old rats, but
there was no age-related insulin resistance in the predominantly
fast-twitch quadriceps muscle from the same rats (Escriva
´ et al.,
2007). In isolated soleus, there was age-related insulin resis-
tance (25 versus 9 months old), but not in the predominantly
fast-twitch epitrochlearis (Sharma et al., 2010). In the soleus,
but not the epitrochlearis, there was an age-related decrease
in Thr308 phosphorylation of Akt2. In neither muscle was
there an age-related difference for phosphorylation of TBC1D4
Thr642. The causes for the apparent fiber type and/or muscle dif-
ferences in insulin signaling and insulin sensitivity in rats remain
to be determined, and similar comparisons are lacking for human
aging.
Exercise Counteracts Age-Related Changes in Insulin
Sensitivity
One exercise session can induce subsequently greater whole-
body insulin-stimulated glucose disposal in young humans or
rats secondary to greater insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by
muscle (Cartee, 2015; Cartee et al., 1989; Nagasawa et al.,
1991; Perseghin et al., 1996; Wojtaszewski et al., 1997, 2000).
Improved insulin sensitivity is observed �1–7 hr post-exercise
and can persist up to 1–2 days post-exercise in both species.
The improved muscle insulin sensitivity is localized primarily, if
not exclusively, in the previously active muscle. Research using
one-legged kicking endurance exercise and comparing the exer-
cised leg to the unexercised leg demonstrates that exercise has
a local effect on the active muscle (Wojtaszewski et al., 2000).
Furthermore, insulin-stimulated leg glucose uptake on the day
after cycling exercise was accompanied by no exercise effect
on the inactive forearm muscle (Annuzzi et al., 1991). Prior exer-
cise can produce markedly elevated insulin-stimulated uptake of
glucose by isolated muscles from rats (Cartee and Holloszy,
1990; Hansen et al., 1998; Wallberg-Henriksson et al., 1988),
indicating a persistent effect that is inherent to skeletal muscle.
However, the inherent muscle effects may be accompanied by
altered muscle blood flow in vivo that contributes to elevated
glucose uptake.
In older (67 years old) women, 1 hr of brisk walking produced
elevated insulin sensitivity on the following day (Wang et al.,
2013). Whole-body insulin sensitivity was also increased the
day after swim exercise by 27-month-old rats (Pauli et al.,
2010). At 3 hr post-exercise by 24- to 30-month-old rats, insu-
lin-stimulated glucose uptake by isolated epitrochlearis muscle
was increased (Cartee et al., 1993; Sharma et al., 2015; Xiao
et al., 2013). Thus, even with aging, skeletal muscle retains the
capacity for metabolic adaptation to exercise.
The mechanism by which acute exercise enhances insulin
sensitivity has mainly been elucidated in studies of young
humans or rats. Several hours after acute exercise by young
rats, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake is elevated because of
greater GLUT4 translocation (Hansen et al., 1998). In young
rats and humans, this improvement is not attributable to elevated
insulin signaling at proximal steps ranging from insulin receptor
binding to Akt activity (Castorena et al., 2014; Hansen et al.,
1998; Wojtaszewski et al., 1999, 2000). Several lines of evidence
suggest that greater TBC1D4 phosphorylation accompanies the
improved insulin-simulated glucose uptake noted 3–27 hr after
acute exercise (Arias et al., 2007; Cartee, 2015; Castorena
et al., 2014; Funai et al., 2009, 2010; Pehmøller et al., 2012;
Schweitzer et al., 2012; Treebak et al., 2009). Therefore, elevated
TBC1D4 phosphorylation is an attractive candidate for the
enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle
of young humans or rats after acute exercise, but a causal link
remains to be established.
The effects of acute exercise on GLUT4 abundance or insulin
signaling in muscles from older humans are unknown, but
studies performed in animal models reveal molecular insight.
For example, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by the epitro-
chlearis of 24-month-old rats was increased 3 hr post-exercise
with unaltered GLUT4 protein abundance (Xiao et al., 2013). In
contrast, the increased insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in
the epitrochlearis of 30-month-old rats at 3 hr post-exercise
was accompanied by a small increase in GLUT4 abundance
(Sharma et al., 2015). In the insulin-stimulated epitrochlearis
from both 24- and 30-month-old rats at 3 hr post-exercise, insu-
lin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was increased on both Thr308
and Ser473, but only in 24-month-old rats was insulin-stimu-
lated TBC1D4 Thr642 phosphorylation increased post-exercise
(Sharma et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2013). Studies of young
rats have consistently found greater TBC1D4 phosphorylation
with little or no change in insulin-stimulated Akt activation

 post-exercise, whereas in old rats, insulin-stimulated Akt activa-
tion was consistently altered, but TBC1D4 phosphorylation was
not always increased. It is notable that the exercise protocols for
young rats (2–4 3 30 min swim exercise bouts with 5 min rest in-
tervals) differed from the protocols for old rats (8–9 3 10–20 min
swim exercise bouts with 10 min rest intervals), and therefore
the different exercise protocols between studies cannot be
excluded.
Although acute exercise has impressive effects on insulin
sensitivity, the regular and repeated performance of exercise
for multiple days, weeks, or months has additional effects. Insu-
lin-stimulated glucose disposal was determined in a group of
initially untrained young men under three conditions: without
exercise, 48 hr after 1 exercise bout, and 48 hr after the final ses-
sion of a 6-week training period (Perseghin et al., 1996). One
exercise bout increased subsequent insulin-mediated glucose
disposal above resting values, and there appeared to be a further
increase after 6 weeks of training, although the difference be-
tween acute and chronic exercise was not statistically tested.
Similar to the results for young humans, various modes of
chronic exercise (cycling, running, walking, resistance exercise)
can lead to subsequently elevated insulin sensitivity in older hu-
mans (60–87 years old) (Consitt et al., 2013; Evans et al., 2005;
Prior et al., 2015). These studies did not include comparison of
the acute versus chronic exercise effects on insulin sensitivity
in older people.
A hallmark adaptation of chronic exercise by young humans
and rats is increased muscle GLUT4 abundance (Holloszy
et al., 1998; Richter and Hargreaves, 2013). Chronic exercise
training can also elevate GLUT4 abundance in muscles of older
(�60–65 years old) humans (Biensø et al., 2015; Cox et al., 1999;
Hughes et al., 1993; Prior et al., 2015). Middle-aged (16 months
old) rats (Kern et al., 1992) and older (24 months old) mice (Willis
et al., 1998) had increased muscle GLUT4 abundance after
chronic exercise. However, other studies did not detect a
training-induced increase in muscle GLUT4 of 25- to 28-
month-old rats (Gulve et al., 1993; Han et al., 1998; Kern et al.,
1992). Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in old rats was elevated
by training despite unaltered GLUT4 abundance (Han et al.,
1998), suggesting a role for other mechanisms.
There is evidence supporting several other possible mecha-
nisms by which exercise training enhances glucose metabolism
in older people. Endurance training by 69-year-old women
and men increased glucose disposal, concomitant with ele-
vated TBC1D4 Ser588 and Thr642 phosphorylation in insulin-stim-
ulated muscle (Consitt et al., 2013). Chronic strength training
also elevated glucose disposal in older women and men together
with greater TBC1D4 phosphorylation on Thr642, but not Ser588.
Other adaptations in muscle after endurance training by older
people (�60–80 years old) include increased hexokinase II and
glycogen synthase protein abundance (Biensø et al., 2015),
greater glycogen concentration (Hughes et al., 1993), and
elevated capillarization (Prior et al., 2015). Chronic resistance
exercise can increase muscle mass, but the magnitude of
these changes is relatively modest with the exercise protocols
commonly used by older people (Marcus et al., 2013). Accord-
ingly, changes in muscle metabolic quality, potentially together
with adaptations in other tissues (e.g., adipose and vascular
tissues), are likely more important for training-induced improve-
ment in insulin sensitivity. Clearly, older people retain the capac-
ity for exercise-induced modifications in the metabolic qualities
of their muscle, although the robustness of the response may
well decline with advancing age, much like many other exer-
cise-induced adaptations.
Mitochondrial Involvement and Impact in Aging Skeletal
Muscle
Mitochondria play a pivotal role in skeletal muscle homeostasis
and bioenergetics. Accordingly, age-related changes in mito-
chondria will have a crucial impact on skeletal muscle mass
and function. Skeletal muscle mitochondria are highly adaptable
and can be increased or decreased in content according to the
metabolic demands of the tissue. As such, the level of habitual
physical activity is a crucial determinant of skeletal muscle
mitochondrial content, irrespective of age. Furthermore, mito-
chondrial morphology is remarkably dynamic and changes in
response to various conditions within the cell. Finally, mitochon-
dria are continually turned over to maintain their fidelity, and thus
mitochondrial content and morphology also need to be consid-
ered in context with mitochondrial function. In the following sec-
tions, current knowledge concerning mitochondrial content,
morphology, and function, and their plasticity across the contin-
uum of aging is reviewed. Note that the issues discussed herein
cannot represent all of the seminal works in the area, and several
recent reviews provide a more in-depth treatment of this topic
(Carter et al., 2015; Dai et al., 2014).
Mitochondrial Content and Morphology
One of the most inconsistent findings in the literature concerns
the impact of aging on skeletal muscle mitochondrial content,
with some studies suggesting no change (Gouspillou et al.,
2014b; Konopka et al., 2014) and others a decrease (Chabi
et al., 2008; Conley et al., 2000; Hebert et al., 2015). This con-
troversy is due in part to the many different measures used to
represent mitochondrial content, including enzyme activities,
mitochondrial protein levels, mtDNA levels, and mitochondrial
volume density. In mouse skeletal muscle, individual proteins
within a mitochondrion appear to have distinct turnover rates
(Karunadharma et al., 2015), suggesting that there is strong po-
tential for altered protein stoichiometries in aging mitochondria,
a factor that likely contributes to the disparities noted above be-
tween different markers of mitochondrial content. Notably, even
within a given study comparing the same indices of mitochon-
drial content, individual muscles can exhibit different changes
with aging in rats (Lyons et al., 2006), such that some muscles
may show declines, while others may show increases (Picard
et al., 2011a).
Mitochondrial content is dynamically regulated according to
the metabolic needs of the tissue, and therefore, changes in
physical activity patterns with aging can also contribute to the in-
consistencies between studies. Thus, isolating the effects of
primary aging on mitochondrial content from the effects of the
decline in physical activity is a challenge, since these are inter-
twined events (e.g., a decline in mitochondrial content due to pri-
mary aging can contribute to reduced physical activity levels).
Moreover, the changes in mitochondrial content may vary at
different points along the aging continuum and depend upon fi-
ber type (Mathieu-Costello et al., 2005), and they may to some

 extent be sex specific based upon recent evidence suggesting
women are more susceptible to a decline in mitochondrial con-
tent with aging (Callahan et al., 2014). Although some studies
have addressed various indices of skeletal muscle mitochondrial
content across a broad age range in humans (Short et al., 2005),
limited data are available in individuals with very advanced age
(>75 years). A more thorough review of this issue can be found
elsewhere (Hepple, 2014).
The diversity of mitochondrial structure that exists in skeletal
muscle (Kuznetsov et al., 2006; Ogata and Yamasaki, 1997), its
dynamic plasticity in response to different myocellular conditions
(Pham et al., 2012; Romanello et al., 2010; Toyama et al., 2016),
and the mechanisms responsible for the regulation of this struc-
ture (Chan, 2012; Mishra et al., 2014; Toyama et al., 2016)
are being increasingly understood. In the context of aging
muscle atrophy, a variety of conditions (e.g., immobilization,
fasting, denervation) result in mitochondrial fission, which in
turn results in activation of muscle proteolytic pathways (Canna-
vino et al., 2015; Romanello et al., 2010). Whereas one
might logically hypothesize that mitochondria should be more
fissioned in aging muscle due to their atrophy, the evidence ad-
dressing this to date is inconclusive. Some evidence suggests
mitochondria are more fragmented in aging skeletal muscle
(Iqbal et al., 2013), whereas other evidence suggests mitochon-
dria are hyper-fused in aging skeletal muscle (Beregi et al., 1988;
Leduc-Gaudet et al., 2015). Part of this disparity likely relates to
the heterogeneity of the fiber effect in aging muscle, particularly
in very advanced age when severely atrophied, denervated fi-
bers are intermingled with relatively normal-looking fibers
(Rowan et al., 2012). For example, since denervation is one of
the stimuli that induce mitochondrial fission in muscle (Iqbal
et al., 2013; Romanello et al., 2010), studies examining muscles
in advanced age are more likely to sample regions from dener-
vated fibers and are thus more likely to observe mitochondria
with highly fissioned morphology. This notion is consistent with
the fact that the studies finding more fused mitochondria with
aging examined younger animals (Beregi et al., 1988; Leduc-
Gaudet et al., 2015) than the study reporting more fissioned
mitochondria (Iqbal et al., 2013). Whereas the appearance of fis-
sioned mitochondria in advanced age is reasonable given the
impact of denervation, the tendency toward hyper-fused mito-
chondria in aging muscle at younger ages is consistent with ob-
servations of so-called giant mitochondria in aging heart (Cole-
man et al., 1987), a finding that has been ascribed to impaired
autophagy (Navratil et al., 2008). This latter idea is consistent
with recent evidence for impaired mitochondrial quality control
mechanisms (Joseph et al., 2013) and a reduction in the mito-
chondrial-targeted ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, in aging human mus-
cle (Drummond et al., 2014; Gouspillou et al., 2014b).
Mitochondrial Function
Mitochondria serve a wide variety of roles in skeletal muscle,
including synthesis of ATP, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
signaling, and regulation of intrinsic pathways of apoptosis. As
was the case for mitochondrial content, a wide variety of
approaches have been taken in evaluating changes in mitochon-
drial function with aging. These include in vivo measures of phos-
phocreatine synthesis (Gouspillou et al., 2014a; Kent-Braun and
Ng, 2000), in vitro measures of biochemical activities of various
enzymes in muscle homogenates (Houmard et al., 1998) and
various aspects of function in mechanically isolated mitochon-
dria (Chabi et al., 2008; Gouspillou et al., 2010; Picard et al.,
2010), and finally ex vivo measures of various aspects of function
in saponin-permeabilized myofibers (Gouspillou et al., 2014b;
Hu
¨ tter et al., 2007; Tonkonogi et al., 2003). Measurements in
isolated organelles or saponin-permeabilized myofibers provide
for a more in-depth assessment of mitochondrial functions,
including respiration/bioenergetics, ROS signaling, and sensi-
tivity to permeability transition, than the other approaches (Pic-
ard et al., 2011b).
While mitochondrial respiratory capacity may decline with ag-
ing in physically inactive humans (Conley et al., 2000) or rodents
(Chabi et al., 2008), it is maintained in physically active humans
(65–75 years old) at least up to old age (75 years) (Gouspillou
et al., 2014b; Lanza et al., 2005). However, this issue has not
yet been examined in very advanced age (>75 years), where
the impact of muscle aging is more clinically meaningful.
Conversely, numerous studies find reduced coupling (e.g.,
reduced ratio of respiration under non-phosphorylating [state 2
or state 4 respiration] versus maximally phosphorylating condi-
tions [state 3 conditions]) (Amara et al., 2007; Gouspillou et al.,
2014b; Marcinek et al., 2005; Picard et al., 2010). Whether this
represents an adaptive response to reduce ROS (Amara et al.,
2007; Speakman et al., 2004) or dysfunction that results in
a less efficient harnessing of the potential energy created by
proton pumping of the electron transport system remains
inconclusive.
Mitochondrial ROS are increasingly being understood in terms
of their importance to cellular signaling and in promoting benefi-
cial cellular adaptations (Lapointe and Hekimi, 2008; Schaar
et al., 2015). Conversely, conceptually it seems logical to sug-
gest that elevated mitochondrial ROS would at some point
become deleterious, and certainly there has been suggestion
that oxidative stress promotes muscle atrophy with aging
(Jang et al., 2010). However, despite many years of interrogating
this issue, the role of mitochondrial ROS in aging muscle remains
a point of contention. Changes in mitochondrial ROS genera-
tion in aging skeletal muscle are remarkably variable between
studies, although the majority report an increase with aging in
both humans and animal models (Capel et al., 2004, 2005; Man-
souri et al., 2006). In contrast to this view, however, a high reli-
ance on isolated organelles, a procedure that potentiates muscle
mitochondrial ROS (Picard et al., 2011c) and that exaggerates
the impact of aging (Picard et al., 2010), has skewed perception
of the changes in mitochondrial ROS in aging skeletal muscle.
Indeed, across four muscles of contrasting fiber type and atro-
phy susceptibility, the increase in mitochondrial ROS in aging
skeletal muscle, even in advanced age, is quite small when using
methods that preserve mitochondrial structure (Picard et al.,
2011a). Furthermore, in physically active humans, mitochondrial
ROS is not increased despite significant muscle atrophy (Gous-
pillou et al., 2014b), suggesting the role of mitochondrial ROS in
driving muscle atrophy with aging has likely been overestimated.
Consistent with this view, mice that lack superoxide dismutase 2
(SOD2, the primary mitochondrial isoform) do not exhibit a mus-
cle atrophy phenotype (Lustgarten et al., 2011), even if the SOD2
knockout is restricted to skeletal muscle (Kuwahara et al., 2010),
but do exhibit evidence of contractile dysfunction. Thus, an

Perspective
 increase in mitochondrial ROS in aging skeletal muscle could
contribute to impaired contractility, but it is unlikely to be the
proximate cause of muscle atrophy. The fact that no increase
in mitochondrial ROS is seen in physically active elderly individ-
uals (Gouspillou et al., 2014b), whereas muscle immobilization
induces an increase in mitochondrial ROS in otherwise healthy
subjects (Gram et al., 2015), suggests that physical activity is
likely an effective way of limiting an increase in mitochondrial
ROS in aging skeletal muscle.
Besides ATP production and ROS signaling, mitochondria
are also key regulators of the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Spe-
cifically, under stressful conditions such as high Ca2+ load, mito-
chondria can undergo a process called permeability transition
wherein a pore across the inner mitochondrial membrane is
formed (the so-called mitochondrial permeability transition pore;
mPTP) that permits the passage of proteins up to 1,500 Da in
size (Bernardi et al., 2015). Notably, there are several mitochon-
drial-localized proteins that, once released through mPTP open-
ing, can induce apoptosis, including endonuclease G (EndoG),
apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and others (Marzetti et al.,
2010). In this respect, and in marked contrast to the highly variable
changes in respiration and ROS in aging skeletal muscle reviewed
above, an increased susceptibility to mPTP opening is consis-
tently reported in aging rodents (Chabi et al., 2008; Picard et al.,
2011a), but it appears it cannot be prevented through maintaining
a physically active lifestyle in humans (Gouspillou et al., 2014b).
The functional impact of an increased sensitivity of mitochondria
to mPTP opening in aging skeletal muscle remains unclear, but
it is noteworthy that a sensitization to mPTP opening occurs
only in aging muscles that undergo atrophy (Hepple, 2014).
Mitochondrial Plasticity in Aging Skeletal Muscle
In view of the potent role that physical activity can play in limiting
mitochondrial changes in aging skeletal muscle, and the well-es-
tablished role that exercise training plays in inducing mitochon-
drial biogenesis, the ability to increase or maintain organelle
biosynthesis with aging is important to consider. An early semi-
nal study from Holloszy’s group provides evidence that the activ-
ity of several mitochondrial enzymes is maintained in response to
nearly life-long swim training in aging rats (Young et al., 1983).
However, at more advanced and thus clinically relevant ages,
exercise responsiveness declines, as reviewed below.
Key to understanding the declining mitochondrial plasticity in
advanced age is the signal transducing machinery that regulates
mitochondrial biogenesis. Although many overlapping pathways
are now implicated in mitochondrial biogenesis, a key player is
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1 (PGC-1),
particularly the alpha isoform (PGC-1a). Upstream of PGC-1a,
adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) (Irrcher et al., 2008)
and sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) (Menzies et al., 2013) have emerged as key
elements determining the induction of PGC-1a in response to
muscle contractile activity. In this respect, whereas exercise
training and chronic muscle contractile activity with electrical
stimulation are both potent inducers of mitochondrial biogenesis
and aerobic performance in aging muscle (Betik et al., 2008;
Cartee and Farrar, 1987; Skorjanc et al., 2001), in advanced
age the response becomes blunted (Betik et al., 2009; Chekanov
et al., 2000; Ljubicic and Hood, 2009a). We have noted a robust
increase in muscle mitochondrial enzyme activities in old rats
following 8 weeks of endurance-focused treadmill exercise
training (Betik et al., 2008); however, continuing the exercise
training for a further 4 months until very old age resulted in no
elevation of mitochondrial enzymes or aerobic contractile
performance in the muscles from the exercise-trained versus
sedentary animals (Betik et al., 2009). The implications of this
latter result are that following the initial benefit, the very old ani-
mals undergoing exercise training exhibited an accelerated
decline in muscle aerobic capacity relative to the sedentary
animals (since the trained animals gained an advantage that
was lost in very advanced age). The causes of this remarkably

advanced age likely relate to a failure to upregulate PGC-1a
(Betik et al., 2009) and other signaling pathways necessary for
inducing an adaptive response (Ljubicic and Hood, 2009a,
2009b). Examining whether this blunted response can be
ascribed to gene silencing subsequent to changes in DNA
methylation and acetylation status (or other epigenetic changes)
would seem a logical next step.
Aging Muscle Atrophy
For the past three decades, there has been a flurry of research
into the etiology of aging muscle atrophy, its functional sequelae,
and treatment efforts. The research has grown concurrent with
(1) a steep rise in the number of adults over 65 years old and
an exponential increase in the number of octogenarians, and
(2) epidemiological findings pointing toward loss of muscle
mass as a major contributor to functional decline, disability,
and dependence (Janssen et al., 2002, 2004a). However, the
mechanistic underpinnings remain poorly understood, and at
best, aging muscle atrophy can be described as a multifactorial
degenerative process impacted by cellular aging biology (pri-
mary aging) and environmental/behavioral factors along with
disease (secondary aging). Among the potential mechanisms,
oxidative stress has received significant attention (Fulle et al.,
2004; Marzetti et al., 2013), and there may be an emerging role
for local muscle inflammation susceptibility with aging that also
manifests in human primary myoblasts and myotubes in vitro
(Merritt et al., 2013).
At its root, aging muscle atrophy results from atrophy of type II
myofibers (Merritt et al., 2013) and loss of both type I and type II
myofibers (Figure 3). These were seminal findings in the early
studies of aging human limb muscles (Lexell et al., 1983,
1986). Decreased myofiber number is presumed to result from
alpha motor neuron death or peripheral denervation at the neuro-
muscular junction. Whether central or peripheral denervation in
origin (or both), one indicator of this neurodegenerative process
is an increase in myofiber type grouping often noted in aging
human muscle (Lexell, 1995; Lexell et al., 1986), as some dener-
vated myofibers survive via reinnervation by a sprouting axon of
a different motor unit type (e.g., type I neuron innervating dener-
vated type II myofibers). Whether evaluated at the myofiber level
histologically, or by gross measures such as dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry to assess regional limb lean mass (e.g., upper
limbs, lower limbs, thighs), age group differences are typically
noted when young adults (e.g., third to fourth decade) are
compared to older adults in the sixth or seventh decade and
beyond. The rate of whole-muscle atrophy appears to be similar
in women and men, although the amount attributable to type II
1040

Perspective
 myofiber atrophy versus myofiber loss may differ by gender, as
type II atrophy among older women appears to exceed that of
age-matched men, particularly among the type IIx myofiber pop-
ulation (Kim et al., 2005; Kosek et al., 2006).
In addition to muscle atrophy, a hallmark of aging is an oblig-
atory decline in neuromuscular performance. Loss of strength
appears to be greater in lower than upper limbs (Landers et al.,
2001), and a decline in muscle power far exceeds that of strength
(Petrella et al., 2005; Young and Skelton, 1994) and appears to
occur more precipitously (Reid and Fielding, 2012). Specific
strength (force per unit muscle) clearly decreases with advancing
age (Goodpaster et al., 2006; Petrella et al., 2005), indicating that
in addition to muscle atrophy, the decline in strength is influ-
enced by factors that reduce muscle quality, such as muscle
lipid content (Goodpaster et al., 2001). Furthermore, the remark-
able loss of muscle power, even after adjusting for muscle mass
(Petrella et al., 2005), suggests age-related changes in excita-
tion-contraction coupling and/or other subcellular mechanisms
responsible for rapid force generation.
Impact of Exercise Countermeasures for Muscle
Atrophy
Favorable neuromuscular adaptations have been observed in
older adults undergoing resistance training, including muscle
and myofiber hypertrophy and remarkable gains in strength
and power (Figure 3). Progressive resistance exercise training
is the most widely accepted strategy to promote muscle re-
growth in atrophied older adults, with more proven efficacy
than pharmacologic or nutritional alternatives. However, the hy-
pertrophic adaptation to progressive resistance exercise training
varies widely among individuals (Bamman et al., 2007) and
is generally blunted in older adults (e.g., 60–75 years old)
compared to young (Bickel et al., 2011). The oldest old (e.g., oc-
togenarians) experience very limited hypertrophy and little to no
improvement in single myofiber function (Raue et al., 2009;
Slivka et al., 2008). This blunted response is not due to a differ-
ence in the ability to perform resistance training at the intensity
effective for muscle hypertrophy, as we have prescribed stan-
dardized doses and reported nearly identical exercise training
intensities among participants ranging from non-responders to
extreme responders (Bamman et al., 2007).
To more fully appreciate the benefits and limitations of
attempts to restore lost muscle mass in older adults, it is note-
worthy that adult myofibers are multinucleated, terminally differ-
entiated cells. Therefore, the only option is to induce hypertrophy
of existing myofibers via mechanisms leading to cellular hyper-
trophy (Adams and Bamman, 2012), which will limit overall mus-
cle hypertrophy in an aging muscle that may have lost 30%–50%
of its original myofibers (Lexell et al., 1988). The two primary
mechanisms for myofiber hypertrophy in humans involve (1) ac-
cretion of protein in the various cellular protein compartments
(e.g., myofibrillar pool) via mechanosensitive signaling pathways
that drive translation, and (2) the activation and recruitment of
resident muscle stem (satellite) cells that differentiate to fusion-
competent myoblasts—each one donating its nucleus to a
growing myofiber via a fusion process. Both processes are
important, as the effectiveness of each appears prognostic for
the magnitude of myofiber hypertrophy achieved (Mayhew
et al., 2011; Petrella et al., 2008). In fact, in addition to aging dif-
ferences in resistance-exercise-induced translational efficiency
(i.e., translation initiation signaling) (Fry et al., 2011), recent evi-
dence suggests translational capacity (i.e., de novo ribosome
biogenesis) may be a key determinant of human myofiber hyper-
trophy potential (Figueiredo et al., 2015), as noted in older adults
both in a progressive resistance exercise training model and in
myotubes in vitro (Stec et al., 2016). A blunted induction of ribo-
some biogenesis among old versus younger adults in response
to each resistance exercise bout (Stec et al., 2015) may be one
mechanism responsible for the lesser progressive resistance
exercise training hypertrophy commonly seen with advancing
age. Thus, ribosome biogenesis may be central to both mecha-
nisms—that is, a myofiber undergoing substantial cytoplasmic
volume expansion (i.e., hypertrophy) via net protein accretion
may be in need of myonuclear addition to provide more rDNA
template to facilitate ribosome biogenesis. Aging myofibers defi-
cient in either mechanism may suffer limited regrowth potential,
whereas aging myofibers with a viable stem cell pool and
mechanosensitive translational signaling would be expected to
benefit greatly from progressive resistance exercise training.
Future Directions
Physical inactivity has profound deleterious effects on health
(Booth et al., 2011). Conversely, the decline in the age-related
decrease in maximal oxygen consumption is markedly reduced
(up to 50%) in individuals who engage in long-term vigorous
endurance exercise training as compared to sedentary people
(Rogers et al., 1990a). Fortunately, even quite late in life, an in-
crease in physical activity is richly rewarded with health benefits.
The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) demonstrated that for
people 25–85 years old with a high risk for developing type 2 dia-
betes, the oldest group (60–85 years old) exceeded the younger
group in achieving both the 7% weight loss and 150 min/week
physical activity goals, and the oldest group was most success-
ful in preventing diabetes (Crandall et al., 2006; Wing et al., 2004).
Because the DPP combined diet modifications with increased
physical activity, these results were not solely attributable to
exercise. However, for women and men 60–85 years old,
increasing physical activity alone can improve insulin sensitivity
and glucose metabolism (Evans et al., 2005; Kirwan et al.,
1993; Short et al., 2003), as well as mitigate age-related muscle

 loss (Hunter et al., 2004). There are currently no interventions
with a higher therapeutic index than either physical exercise
and/or diet manipulation to reduce the risk of virtually all chronic
diseases simultaneously, with little or no adverse side effects.
Consequently, future research should be directed toward deci-
phering optimal exercise and nutrition programs to achieve
healthy aging.
Future efforts should be focused on mechanisms by which
different modes of exercise enhance whole-body metabolism
and mitigate declines in strength across the aging population.
To achieve compliance, it may be more realistic to incorporate
short bouts of exercise to be undertaken throughout the day
that are aligned with activities of daily living. For example, in in-
sulin-resistant men and women 18–55 years old (48 ± 6 years),
undertaking an ‘‘exercise snacking’’ routine of six 1 min exercise
bouts, consisting of walking at 90% maximal heart rate with
1 min recovery (slow walking) between each, 30 min before
breakfast, lunch, and dinner markedly improved glycemic con-
trol compared with a single 30 min bout of moderate continuous
exercise undertaken before the evening meal (Francois et al.,
2014). Similar improvements in glucose homeostasis were
achieved when the exercise bouts were alternated between aer-
obic-based exercise and resistance-based exercise using resis-
tance bands (as many reps as possible within 60 s) (Francois
et al., 2014). These findings suggest that the timing and intensity
of exercise may be important for optimizing glucose control.
Further exercise training studies of different endurance and
strength modalities that are conducted over weeks or months
are warranted, particularly in the elderly, to evaluate the effects
on insulin sensitivity, long-term blood glucose control, and
muscle strength. This type of program is relatively easy to
monitor and can be performed in the home setting and in
conjunction with activities of daily living, making compliance
easier to achieve.
Despite the compelling evidence that exercise is medicine,
several questions remain. From a mechanistic perspective,
greater insight into the specific cellular and molecular events
during and after exercise that account for the enhanced insulin
sensitivity and preservation of muscle mass with aging is
required. Such efforts may advance the discovery of unique
molecular biometrics to identify individuals with early onset of
skeletal muscle insulin resistance, mitochondrial dysfunction,
or aging-induced muscle atrophy. Stratification of individuals
based on their response to different endurance- or resistance-
based exercise training programs in terms of enhanced insulin
sensitivity and mitochondrial function, as well as the hypertro-
phic adaptation of skeletal muscle, may also identify people at
risk for metabolic disease and secondary aging. In such cases,
specialized exercise prescription may be beneficial to ward off
secondary aging.
Integrated approaches to identify molecular signatures of
skeletal muscle and the adaptive response to diverse modes
of exercise training programs (both endurance based and resis-
tance based) across the spectrum of aging may be valuable to
stratify different response patterns for personalized treatment.
For example, biomarkers derived from a composite of an individ-
ual’s genomic, transcriptomic/proteomic, and metabolomic
profile, compared against physiological measures of insulin
sensitivity and functional muscle mass/strength, at rest or after
exercise training, may identify people at risk for accelerated
muscle wasting, diminished work/exercise capacity, or rapid
progression into type 2 diabetes. The future will advance
research into how these parameters can be altered to promote
healthy aging. Several efforts are now underway to identify and
validate molecular signatures of skeletal muscle that are associ-
ated with aging-related disorders, including overt type 2 dia-
betes, and the adaptive response to exercise training in humans
using multiple omics-based approaches (Neufer et al., 2015;
Zierath and Wallberg-Henriksson, 2015). Initiatives to uncover
individual variability that will influence risk assessment, diag-
nostic categories, and therapeutic strategies are ongoing, her-
alding a new era of precision medicine (Collins and Varmus,
2015). However, much distance needs to be covered before
this personalized approach can be translated into targeted clin-
ical care. Future efforts to integrate physiological and molecular
data from clinical cohorts, cell-based systems, and animal
models, as well as measures of behavioral, physiological, and
environmental factors, will be required before the spectrum of
primary and secondary age-related changes on human physi-
ology is fully realized.
From a translational perspective, clinical insight into key as-
pects of specific exercise protocols designed to improve insulin
sensitivity, mitochondrial function, muscle mass, and overall
physical capacity is needed. Moreover, it is important to consider
how such protocols can be implemented to achieve optimal ben-
efits while accommodating the physical limitations of very old and
frail individuals to achieve ‘‘healthy aging.’’ Accordingly, the inter-
actions between lifestyle interventions (nutrition and physical ac-
tivity) in treating and managing insulin resistance, obesity, and
aging muscle atrophy are important to determine. By implement-
ing strategies to maintain insulin sensitivity and mitigate aging
muscle atrophy before the onset of frailty to maintain glucose ho-
meostasis and physical function, many of the deleterious effects
ofunhealthy aging canbe markedlyattenuated. Such efforts have
the potential to dramatically reduce the associated health care
costs of unhealthy aging. Given the evidence that modifiable life-
style factors have the potential to limit secondary aging, the pro-
verbial ‘‘fountain of youth’’ may be just down the street at your
nearest neighborhood gym.
