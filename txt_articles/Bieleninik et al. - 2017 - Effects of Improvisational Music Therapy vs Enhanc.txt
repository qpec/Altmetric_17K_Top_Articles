IMPORTANCE Music therapy may facilitate skills in areas affected by autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), such as social interaction and communication.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate effects of improvisational music therapy on generalized social
communication skills of children with ASD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Assessor-blinded, randomized clinical trial, conducted
in 9 countries and enrolling children aged 4 to 7 years with ASD. Children were recruited from
November 2011 to November 2015, with follow-up between January 2012 and November 2016.
INTERVENTIONS Enhanced standard care (n = 182) vs enhanced standard care plus
improvisational music therapy (n = 182), allocated in a 1:1 ratio. Enhanced standard care
consisted of usual care as locally available plus parent counseling to discuss parents’concerns
and provide information about ASD. In improvisational music therapy, trained music
therapists sang or played music with each child, attuned and adapted to the child’
s focus of
attention, to help children develop affect sharing and joint attention.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was symptom severity
over 5 months, based on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), social affect
domain (range, 0-27; higher scores indicate greater severity; minimal clinically important
difference, 1). Prespecified secondary outcomes included parent-rated social responsiveness.
All outcomes were also assessed at 2 and 12 months.
RESULTS Among 364 participants randomized (mean age, 5.4 years; 83% boys), 314 (86%)
completed the primary end point and 290 (80%) completed the last end point. Over 5 months,
participants assigned to music therapy received a median of 19 music therapy, 3 parent
counseling, and 36 other therapy sessions, compared with 3 parent counseling and 45 other
therapy sessions for those assigned to enhanced standard care. From baseline to 5 months,
mean ADOS social affect scores estimated by linear mixed-effects models decreased from 14.08
to 13.23 in the music therapy group and from 13.49 to 12.58 in the standard care group (mean
difference, 0.06 [95% CI, −0.70 to 0.81]; P = .88), with no significant difference in
improvement. Of 20 exploratory secondary outcomes, 17 showed no significant difference.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among children with autism spectrum disorder,
improvisational music therapy, compared with enhanced standard care, resulted in no
significant difference in symptom severity based on the ADOS social affect domain
over 5 months. These findings do not support the use of improvisational music therapy for
symptom reduction in children with autism spectrum disorder.

 A
utism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by
persistent deficits in social communication and
interaction and restricted, repetitive behaviors
and interests.1 ASD affects about 1% of the general popula-
tion and is associated with substantial disability and eco-
nomic loss.2,3 A variety of approaches to improve the core
deficits and lives of people with ASD have been developed,
including behavioral, developmental, educational, and
medical interventions,4,5 but the strength of evidence for re-
ducing autism severity is low for most interventions.4
In the first description of autism, Kanner6 noted that many
children with autism had a strong preference for music.
Music therapy seeks to exploit the potential of music as a me-
dium for social communication.7-9 In improvisational music
therapy, client and therapist spontaneously create music using
singing, playing, and movement; music is understood in the
widest sense. It is a developmental, child-centered approach
in which a music therapist follows the child’
s focus of atten-
tion, behaviors, and interests to facilitate development in the
child’
s social communicative skills.10 In 2017 there were about
7000 music therapists in the United States11 and 6000 in
Europe.12 Randomized trials have suggested positive effects
of music therapy on social interaction, joint attention, and par-
ent-child relationships.13 Evidence on longer-term effects and
dose-effect relations is lacking, and evidence that effects ob-
served within therapy sessions generalize to other settings,
situations, and people needs confirmation.13 The objective of
this study was to evaluate effects of improvisational music
therapy on generalized social communication skills of chil-
dren with ASD.
Methods
Trial Design
The Trial of Improvisational Music Therapy’
s Effectiveness for
Children With Autism (TIME-A) was an assessor-blinded, in-
ternational, multicenter (10 centers), parallel-group, prag-
matic randomized clinical trial that compared improvisa-
tional music therapy (hereafter referred to as music therapy)
added to enhanced standard care (usual care plus parent coun-
seling;hereafterreferredtoasstandardcare)withstandardcare
alone for improving social communicative skills in children
with ASD. Ethics approval was obtained by the relevant eth-
ics committees in each of the 9 countries (Australia, Austria,
Brazil, Israel, Italy, Korea, Norway, United Kingdom, United
States). Written informed consent was obtained from parents
orguardians.Anindependentdataandsafetymonitoringcom-
mittee monitored safety and examined interim efficacy re-
sults.Thestudyprotocolwaspublishedseparately14andisalso
available in Supplement 1.
Participants and Trial Procedures
Trial procedures were pilot tested.15 Children aged 4 years to
6 years, 11 months and meeting criteria for ASD according
to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and
Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision16 were enrolled be-
tween November 2011 and November 2015 and followed up
from January 2012 to November 2016. Exclusion criteria were
serious sensory disorders (blindness, deafness) and having re-
ceived music therapy in the last 12 months. Diagnosis was con-
firmed using the ASD cutoff of the Autism Diagnostic Obser-
vationSchedule(ADOS)17andcutoffson2ofthe3maindomains
of the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised.18 Cognitive abil-
ity was assessed quantitatively using a standardized IQ test or
categorically by clinical judgment if the child was unable to
completeaformaltest.Participatingparentsorguardianscom-
pletedtheSocialResponsivenessScale(SRS)19andtwo100-mm
visual analog scales for quality of life of the participant and the
family. Parents also reported demographics and concomitant
treatments. Follow-up assessments at 2, 5, and 12 months af-
ter randomization included ADOS, SRS, quality of life, and con-
comitant treatments; at 12 months, we also assessed success
of blinding and reason for potential dropout.
After consent and baseline assessments, participants were
randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions: low-intensity (once
per week) or high-intensity (3 times per week) music therapy
added to standard care, or standard care alone, over a period
of 5 months. Participants were free to attend any type of treat-
ment or therapeutic interventions but were asked not to at-
tend music therapy outside the study context.
Individuals were randomly assigned according to a com-
puter-generated randomization list with a ratio 1:1:2 (low-
intensity music therapy:high-intensity music therapy:
standard care), stratified by site and with randomly varying
block sizes of 4 and 8, which was prepared by an investigator
withnoclinicalinvolvement.Acoordinator(Ł.B.)withnoclini-
cal involvement checked eligibility and baseline data before
handing out the randomization via an online system.
All data were stored within an electronic database man-
agement system on a secure server with password-controlled
access (OpenClinica, version 3.3) and double-entered inde-
pendently. Changes to the protocol compared with its pub-
lished version are shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
Interventions
Improvisational music therapy was offered in outpatient set-
tings (clinics, kindergartens, family homes) in 30-minute one-
to-one sessions (possibly joined by family members). Depend-
ing on the randomization to high- or low-intensity music
Key Points
Question Does improvisational music therapy improve symptom
severity of children with autism spectrum disorder?
Findings In a randomized clinical trial of 364 children in 9
countries, mean autism severity, as measured on the Autism
Diagnostic Observation Schedule, social affect domain, over 5
months, was reduced from 14.08 to 13.23 in the improvisational
music therapy group and from 13.49 to 12.58 in the enhanced
standard care group, which included parent counseling and other
available interventions, a nonsignificant mean difference of 0.06.
Meaning In children with autism spectrum disorder, music
therapy did not result in significant improvements in mean
symptom scores compared with enhanced standard care.

 therapy, either 3 weekly sessions (a higher dose, common in
some countries) or 1 weekly session (the de facto standard in
many countries) were offered for a period of 5 months, a du-
ration deemed sufficient to notice development. Thirty quali-
fied music therapists (21 women; mean age, 34.7 years [range,
23-55 years]; mean experience as music therapists, 7.3 years
[range, 0-30 years]) conducted the therapy, following a set of
consensus principles developed for the study.10 Therapists de-
veloped joint musical activities (singing or instrumental play)
individually with each child, based on the child’
s focus of at-
tention, using improvisation techniques such as synchroniz-
ing, mirroring, or grounding. These activities aimed to de-
velop and enhance affect sharing and joint attention, which
are associated with development of social competencies in
ASD.14 Sessions were videotaped or audiotaped for assess-
ment of fidelity.10,14 Two independent raters assessed 606 ran-
domly selected 3-minute segments from 63 participants.
Enhancedstandardcareconsistedoftheroutinecareavail-
able at the site, plus three 60-minute sessions of parent coun-
seling (at 0, 2, and 5 months). Twenty-four professionals ex-
perienced with ASD (20 women; clinical psychologists, social
workers, or music therapists) offered to discuss parents’con-
cerns and provide information about ASD, based on prin-
ciples described in the protocol.14 The purpose of the design
was to provide a minimal intervention and to increase adher-
ence and equipoise. Sessions were videotaped when pos-
sible. Parents reported other service use.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the social affect score of the ADOS,17
a measure of autism symptom severity, over 5 months.
The ADOS is a semistructured, standardized observation in-
strument. Designed as a diagnostic tool, it has also been used
to measure intervention outcomes.20-25 One of 3 modules and
1 of 5 scoring algorithms was chosen, depending on language
abilities and age. Of a total of 28 to 31 ADOS items, 10 are used
to calculate the ADOS social affect score. Items can range from
0 to 2 or 3; in line with an earlier trial,25 the full range of item
scoresfrom0to3wasretainedtoimprovesensitivitytochange.
We applied the same module across time points for each child
to ensure consistency.14 The ADOS social affect score, con-
structed as the sum of the relevant items for the social affect
domain, can range from 0 to 27 (in module 3; 0-24 in mod-
ules 1 and 2), with higher scores indicating greater severity.
We assumed a minimal clinically important difference (MCID)
of 1 point.14 We used the most current version available in all
countries and languages.17 Formal training in ADOS assess-
ments was available in some but not all countries. All asses-
sors in Australia, Korea, and the United Kingdom had com-
pleted research-level qualification (the highest level); those in
Israel, Italy, Norway, and the United States had at least clinical-
level qualification (the basic level). In Austria and Brazil,
no certification was available, but we used experienced ADOS
raters. Of the 23 assessors, 10 had research training and 10 had
clinical training. We used assessors from a different location
whowerenotnormallyinvolvedwiththechildtoensureblind-
ing. Success of blinding was verified by asking assessors if and
how they had discovered the child’
s allocation.
Prespecified secondary outcomes were the ADOS social
affect score over 2 and 12 months and the SRS total scale and
its 5 subscales over 2, 5, and 12 months. The SRS is a parent-
ratedmeasureandwasthereforenotblinded.Atotalof65items
(each ranging from 0 [“not true”] to 3 [“almost always true”])
assess the severity of ASD symptoms occurring in natural
social settings, as observed by parents, for a total score of
0 to 195. A score of 85 or above provides strong evidence of
the presence of an ASD and is recommended for clinical
settings.19 The subscales are social awareness (8 items), so-
cial cognition (12), social communication (22), social motiva-
tion (11), and autistic mannerisms (12).19 An additional out-
come, cost-effectiveness, will be reported separately.
Post hoc outcomes, all at 2, 5, and 12 months, included the
ADOS total score and subscales; two 100-mm visual analog
scales for parent-reported quality of life of the child and of the
familyasawhole(0 = worstto100 = bestpossiblequalityoflife);
and parent-reported adverse events including hospitalization.
Statistical Analyses
The study was originally conceived as a group sequential de-
sign with 4 interim analyses14 but was stopped after the first
prespecified analysis (see Results). Power was calculated for
the 2-group comparison to detect an MCID of 1 point for ADOS
social affect score. Although there is no consensus MCID for
this outcome, a 1-point difference in ADOS social affect score
(typical SD, ≈5)25 was chosen because it would correspond to
Cohen d = 0.20 (a small effect size). Previous music therapy
trialshadfoundeffectsizesofd = 0.50forgesturalandd = 0.36
for verbal communicative skills,26 whereas a larger trial of an-
other intervention25 had found an effect size of d = 0.24 on the
ADOS.14 As conducted, the study had 42% power to detect a
differenceof1point,or80%powerforadifferenceof1.6points.
The main statistical analysis14 followed a modified inten-
tion-to-treat (ITT) principle, including all participants who had
data for at least 1 follow-up time point in the group to which
theyhadoriginallybeenrandomized.Analysescomparedmean
change on the primary outcome in longitudinal models, fol-
lowing confirmation of normality. We calculated linear mixed-
effects models with maximum likelihood estimation, both un-
adjusted and adjusted for site as a random effect, for the main
2-group comparison and the additional 3-group comparison
including intensity of music therapy, with treatment effects
represented as interaction effects (time × group). Sensitivity
analyses for the primary outcome and comparison tested the
influence of missing data (linear models on 50 data sets mul-
tiply imputed using diagnosis, age, and site) and therapist ef-
fects (linear mixed-effects model with music therapist as a ran-
dom effect nested within site). Prespecified subgroup analyses
were conducted for age and ASD subtype, using linear mod-
els with interaction tests.
Secondary outcomes were analyzed using linear mixed-
effects models. Because no adjustments for multiple testing
were made, all secondary outcomes were regarded as explor-
atory. No statistical analysis was conducted for exploratory ad-
verse events.
In a post hoc responder analysis,27 we compared the pro-
portion of participants who improved by at least the MCID for

 the ADOS social affect score at 5 months. In this binary ITT
analysis, we included all participants randomized, assuming
no improvements for missing data. We calculated risk ratios
with 2-sided 95% confidence intervals using Wald uncondi-
tional maximum likelihood estimation for the ITT sample and
the per-protocol sample. All tests were 2-sided, with a signifi-
cance level of 5%. All statistical analyses were conducted using
R version 3.3.1 (http://www.r-project.org).
Results
Of 702 children assessed for eligibility, 315 (109 ineligible;
206 declined) were excluded prior to baseline assessments,
and another 23 were found ineligible at baseline, before ran-
domization. A total of 364 participants were randomized to
music therapy or standard care (182 participants each)
(Figure 1). Of the 182 children enrolled to music therapy, 90
were randomized to high-intensity music therapy and 92 to
low-intensity music therapy. The data and safety monitoring
committee examined the first interim efficacy analysis in
September 2015. Although the formal criterion for early stop-
ping was not met, the study team decided to stop recruit-
ment, in a decision that included considerations of limited
funding and therefore limited likelihood of successful and
timely additional recruitment.
Baselinecharacteristicswerewellbalancedbetweengroups
(Table 1). Of the 364 participants, 302 were boys, 301 were di-
agnosed with childhood autism, and 165 had low cognitive lev-
els(IQ<70).Twelveparticipants(3%)hadpriorexperiencewith
musictherapy.Fiftyparticipants(14%)werelosttothe5-month
follow-up (Figure 1). Baseline characteristics of those who
dropped out at 5 months were similar to those who were fol-
lowed up (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Blinding of assessors was broken unintentionally for 20
participants (15 in the music therapy group and 5 in the stan-
dard care group), usually due to a parent or other person in-
advertently mentioning the intervention. There was no evi-
dence of broken or subverted allocation concealment (eFigure
1 in Supplement 2).
Concomitant interventions, provided as part of standard
care, included speech and language therapy or communica-
tion training (58%), sensory-motor therapy (including occu-
pational therapy and physiotherapy [41%]), and a number of
other therapies, which often continued over the course of the
trial (eTable 3 in Supplement 2). The median number of ses-
sions of all concomitant interventions (not including parent
counselingorimprovisationalmusictherapy)overthe5-month
intervention period was 45 in those allocated to standard care,
compared with 36 sessions in those allocated to music therapy
(high-intensity music therapy, 31; low-intensity music therapy,
40). The parents of 317 (87%) of all participants participated
in counseling; the median number of sessions was 3 in all
groups (Figure 1); fidelity was adequate (eTable 4A in
Supplement 2).
Ofthoseallocatedtomusictherapy,171(94%)receivedmu-
sic therapy, with a median of 19 sessions over the 5-month pe-
riod (high-intensity music therapy, 34; low-intensity music
therapy, 15) (Figure 1). Missed sessions were typically attrib-
utable to holidays or illness (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). How-
ever, some parents had difficulties bringing their child to
therapy 3 times a week. Treatment fidelity according to the im-
provisational music therapy manual10 was overall adequate in
the majority of sessions (eTable 4 and eFigure 3 in Supplement
2). Of those allocated to standard care, none received music
therapy during the 5-month intervention period. However, 1%
in each group received music therapy outside the study be-
fore the 12-month follow-up (Figure 1).
Primary Outcome
From baseline to 5 months, mean scores of ADOS social affect
estimatedbylinearmixed-effectsmodelsdecreasedfrom14.08
to 13.23 in the music therapy group and from 13.49 to 12.58 in
the standard care group (mean difference, music therapy vs
standard care, 0.06 [95% CI, −0.70 to 0.81]; P = .88), with no
significant difference in improvement (eTable 5 in Supple-
ment2).Theobservedmeans(Table2)differslightlyfromthose
estimated with linear mixed-effects models, which use data
from all time points at once. Differences in the models ad-
justedforsitewerealsononsignificant(eTable5inSupplement
2).Nosignificantdifferenceswerefoundbetweenhigh-orlow-
intensity music therapy and standard care (eTable 6 in
Supplement 2). Changes over time are shown in Figure 2. Pre-
specified subgroup analyses did not suggest different effects
of music therapy vs standard care attributable to age (P = .30)
or ASD subtype (P = .87).
Secondary Outcomes
Of 20 prespecified exploratory secondary outcomes, most
showed no significant difference (eTables 5 and 6 in
Supplement 2). ADOS social affect scores over 2 and 12 months
and SRS total scores over 2, 5, and 12 months are also shown
in Table 2 and Figure 2. Small but nominally significant ef-
fects were found in several SRS subscales (in linear mixed-
effects models either adjusted or unadjusted for site)—music
therapy was associated with greater improvements than stan-
dard care in social motivation over 5 months and autistic
mannerisms over 2 and 12 months (eTable 5 in Supplement 2).
In the 3-group comparison, low-intensity music therapy,
compared with standard care, was associated with greater im-
provements in social awareness at 2 months; high-intensity
music therapy, compared with standard care, was associated
with greater improvements in autistic mannerisms over 5
months (eTable 6 in Supplement 2).
Exploratory Analyses and Outcomes
No significant difference between music therapy and stan-
dard care was seen in the sensitivity analysis using multiple
imputation (mean difference, music therapy vs standard care,
0.06 [95% CI, −0.61 to 0.72]; P = .87) or including the music
therapist as a random effect (mean difference, music therapy
vs standard care, 0.05 [95% CI, −0.71 to 0.80]; P = .90).
Post hoc responder analyses indicated a higher propor-
tion of improvement in ADOS social affect at 5 months in the
music therapy group (95/182 [52%]) than in the standard care
group (76/182 [42%]) (risk ratio, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.00 to 1.56];

 risk difference, 0.10 [95% CI, 0.00 to 0.21], P = .047). The pro-
portion of improvement was higher in participants who re-
ceived at least 15 music therapy sessions (78/134 [58%]) than
in those who received standard care (76/182 [42%]) (risk ra-

to 0.27]; P = .004).
Among the post hoc outcomes, mean changes in partici-
pants’quality of life at 5 months were significantly more
positive in the high-intensity music therapy group than in
the standard care group, but no significant differences were
seen in other outcomes or comparisons (eTables 5 and 6 in
Supplement 2).

 Adverse Events
Hospitalization or other institutional stay was rare at base-
line (9 assigned to music therapy and 3 assigned to standard
care had an institutional stay during the last 2 months). Dur-
ing participation in the study, these rates remained stable in
the standard care group (3 at 2 months, 3 at 5 months, and 4
at 12 months) and decreased in the music therapy group (6 at
2 months, 6 at 5 months, and 4 at 12 months). These institu-
tional stays were typically planned and short-term. No other
adverse events or serious adverse events were reported.
Discussion
In this international, multicenter clinical trial of children with
ASD, improvisational music therapy added to enhanced stan-
dard care, compared with enhanced standard care alone, re-
sulted in no significant difference in symptom severity based
on the ADOS social affect domain over 5 months. Addition-
ally, the amount of improvement in both groups was small and
less than the MCID, suggesting that use of improvisational mu-
sic therapy for children with ASD may not lead to meaningful
improvement in symptom severity and may not be war-
ranted for improving autistic symptoms.
Most of the exploratory secondary outcomes were also
nonsignificant. The few significant outcomes were small and
unlikely to be clinically important. Observed differences in so-
cial responsiveness subscales may be artifacts attributable to
multiplicity and lack of blinding. The post hoc finding of a
higher proportion of responders in the music therapy group
compared with the standard care group should be inter-
preted with caution and may be biased by differential attri-
tion. No dose effect was found in the prespecified analyses.
Thefindingscontrastwiththoseofpreviousstudies.Asys-
tematicreviewof10clinicaltrialsconcludedthatmusictherapy
may help children with ASD to improve skills in areas consti-
tuting the core of the condition.13 One important difference is
that previous trials were limited to 1 local context and 1 or a
few therapists, where consistent implementation of interven-
tions may be easier than in a global trial.
Alternatively, methodological differences, such as the
choice of a proximal vs a distal outcome, also may explain the
difference.Notrialofmusictherapyandveryfewtrialsofother
psychosocial interventions showed effects on generalized
behaviors4 using blinded assessments on the ADOS. Assessor-
blinded trials of parent-mediated interventions have shown
mixed results.20,23-25 A nonblinded study found effects of a
teacher-directed intervention.22 Another nonblinded study of
a developmental intervention, with more than 1000 treat-
ment hours per child, did not.21
Although a large number of treatment hours is consid-
ered important in autism interventions, early claims suggest-
ing benefits with early intensive behavioral intervention were
notreplicatedinrigorousrandomizedevaluations.21,28Thebur-
den associated with attending therapy sessions also needs to
be considered. In this study, participants assigned to music
therapy tended to receive fewer other therapies, and not all
wereabletoattendasfrequentlyasplanned,particularlywhen
additional travel was needed.
Although the present trial did not capture the child’
s ex-
perience with improvisational music therapy, it seemed very
well accepted by parents, children, and staff. In a qualitative
study connected to this trial, parents reported their chil-
dren’
s enjoyment and benefit from improvisational music
therapy and experienced their own involvement as positive.29
This study represented a first attempt to implement music

ing to improve it. This ranges from improving therapists’abil-
ity to attune optimally to the child30 to including family mem-
bers more actively.31
Strengths and Limitations
The strengths of this study, compared with previous trials of
music therapy in ASD, include its size, duration, blinding
of the primary outcome, and multiplicity of perspectives.
However,severallimitationsmustbenoted.First,asaprag-
matictrial,13generalizabilitywashigher,butmusictherapywas
not as tightly controlled and perhaps not as consistently imple-
mented as in previous single-center trials.10 Second, early ter-
mination may have affected the study’
s ability to reliably de-
tectanMCID,14althoughthenarrowconfidenceintervalaround
the mean difference may ameliorate concerns about insuffi-
cient power.
Third,thedurationofinterventionandfollow-up,although
longer than in previous trials, may have been too short. In rou-
tine practice, music therapy for children with ASD is often
continuedforyearsratherthanmonths.Delayedeffectsarenot
uncommoninASDinterventions.23Fourth,thefocusonsymp-
tomseverityasanoutcome,andtheADOSinparticular,hasbeen
disputed. Some have argued for a shift toward outcomes such
as well-being and adaptive functioning—being able to engage
inlearning,participatesuccessfullyinschoolthroughchildhood
and adolescence, and work and have meaningful relationships
as adults—which may matter more to people with ASD than
symptomseverity.32Fifth,allsecondaryoutcomeswereexplor-
atory, nonblinded, and not adjusted for multiplicity.

 Conclusions
Among children with autism spectrum disorder, improvisa-
tional music therapy, compared with enhanced standard care,
resulted in no significant difference in symptom severity
based on the ADOS social affect domain over 5 months. These
findings do not support the use of improvisational music
therapy for symptom reduction in children with autism spec-
trum disorder.
