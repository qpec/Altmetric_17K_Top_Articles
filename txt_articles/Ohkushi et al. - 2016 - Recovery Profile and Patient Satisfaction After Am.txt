The purpose of this study was to determine which anesthetic was preferable for
ambulatory anesthesia: propofol alone or sevoflurane alone. A crossover study was
performed to compare the recovery profile and patient satisfaction after 2 anesthesia
methods. Twenty healthy patients with severe anxiety toward dental treatment
undergoing 2 sessions of day-case dental treatment received either propofol or
sevoflurane anesthesia. The order of these methods was randomized. The depths of
anesthesia were kept constant using bispectral index (BIS) monitoring. Observations
on recovery profiles were performed in the emergence phase, in the recovery phase,
and 24 hours after discharge. Patient satisfaction and preference were obtained by a
questionnaire. Most of the recovery profiles in the emergence phase such as time to
eye opening to respond to verbal command, time to BIS � 75, and time to
extubation were shorter in the sevoflurane group than in the propofol group. All
recovery profiles in the recovery phase showed no differences between the 2 groups.
Based on the subject’s satisfaction and preference, propofol was evaluated as a better
anesthetic for ambulatory anesthesia than sevoflurane. Higher patient satisfaction
and a greater preference for future dental treatment were revealed for propofol
anesthesia. Propofol may be more suitable for ambulatory anesthesia for dental
treatment.

A
nesthetics used for ambulatory anesthesia should
have the following characteristics: smooth and
rapid induction, easily controllable depth of anesthesia
in
the
maintenance
phase,
rapid
emergence
and
recovery from anesthesia, and few adverse reactions
after general anesthesia.1 Two anesthetics currently used
for ambulatory anesthesia are propofol and sevoflurane.
Emergence from propofol anesthesia is rapid because
the context-sensitive half-time is less than 30 minutes2
even after 5-hour continuous infusion. Emergence from
sevoflurane anesthesia is also rapid,3 as seen from the
blood-gas distribution coefficient at 0.65 and tissue-gas
partition coefficient at 1.1 for major tissues other than
fat. Many studies have compared the recovery profiles
following propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia, and

 systematic reviews have also been published.4,5 In each
study, however, other drugs such as opioid analgesics
and/or nitrous oxide were combined during mainte-
nance of anesthesia, and there are no studies for adult
subjects comparing the recovery profile from anesthesia
maintained with these anesthetics alone. In addition,
because
the
previous
studies
divided
subjects
into
subgroups by anesthesia method, individual differences
might have influenced the recovery profile. We therefore
performed a crossover study to determine which was
more preferable for ambulatory anesthesia between
propofol and sevoflurane based on the comparison of
the
recovery
profile
and
patient
satisfaction
after
anesthesia.
METHODS
Subjects
This study was approved by the Ethics Review Board of
Tokyo Dental College Ethics Committee (approval
number 267). Subjects were 20 patients scheduled to
undergo dental treatment 2 or more times under
general anesthesia because of extensive dental needs
and severe anxiety towards dental treatment. All
subjects received general anesthesia for dental treat-
ment for the first time. All subjects gave written
informed consent. Subjects received either propofol
anesthesia or sevoflurane anesthesia. The order of
these methods was randomized. All patients were
classified as ASA physical status I or II. Alcoholics,
drug-dependent individuals, obese patients with a body
mass index of 26 or more, and pregnant women were
excluded.
Anesthesia Method
No preanesthetic medication was administered. Anes-
thesia was started at 9:00 AM in both groups. On arrival
in the outpatient clinic, standard monitoring equipment
including body temperature, electrocardiograph, heart
rate, noninvasive blood pressure, arterial oxygen satura-
tion, inspired oxygen, and end-tidal concentration of
carbon dioxide was applied. A bispectral index (BIS)
monitor (BIS MONITOR Model A-2000, Aspect Medical
Systems) was also used. A venous line was established in
the left cephalic vein and acetated Ringer solution (Veen
F, Kowa Company Ltd) was infused at a rate of
approximately 100 mL/h.
In the propofol group, anesthesia was induced with
propofol (1% Diprivan injection kit, AstraZeneca) under
inhalation of 100% oxygen at 6 L/min, using a TCI
pump (Terufusion TCI syringe pump TE-371, TER-
UMO Corporation) with predicted effect site concen-
tration at 3.5 lg/mL. In the sevoflurane group,
anesthesia was induced with 3% sevoflurane (Sevo-
frane, Abbott Japan Co, Ltd) using a face mask with
supplemental oxygen at 6 L/min. Nasotracheal intuba-
tion was facilitated with 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium bromide
(Eslax intravenous solution, Schering-Plough) for both
groups.
During anesthesia, predicted effect site concentration
of propofol and inhaled concentration of sevoflurane
were adjusted to maintain BIS value at 40–60 under
inhalation of oxygen at 1 L/min and air at 3 L/min.
Artificial ventilation was performed using a ventilator
(Acoma Ventilator PRO-Vmk II, Acoma Co, Ltd) to
maintain end-tidal concentration of carbon dioxide at
35–40 mm Hg. When bucking or body movement
occurred during anesthesia, the concentration of anes-
thetic was increased by approximately 0.2 lg/mL for
propofol and 0.5% for sevoflurane. In the case of further
body movement, 0.2 mg/kg rocuronium bromide was
administered. Local anesthesia for deep dental caries
restoration, pulpectomy, and tooth extraction with
appropriate doses of 2% lidocaine hydrochloride solution
containing epinephrine at 12.5 lg/mL (1 : 80,000) was
used. After discontinuation of the anesthetics, controlled
ventilation was continued until spontaneous respiration
was resumed. We did not require reversal of neuromus-
cular blockade in either group. Patients were extubated
after confirmation that tidal volume had returned to 4
mL/kg, the patient was responsive to commands, and
recovery of swallowing reflex was sufficient. Subjects
who received pulpectomy and/or tooth extraction took
120 mg of loxoprofen sodium or 50 mg of diclofenac
sodium at discharge.
Observational Period and Indices
Observation was performed in the emergence phase, in
the recovery phase, and 24 hours after discharge. The
emergence phase was defined as the period from
discontinuation of the anesthetics until extubation, and
observations made during this interval were time to
restoration of spontaneous respiration, time to eye
opening, time to respond to verbal command, time to
BIS � 75, and time to extubation. The recovery phase
was defined as the period from extubation until hospital
discharge. During this phase, Aldrete score6 and
Modified Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring System7
were calculated every 5 minutes to obtain the time until
each score reached �9. A trained observer asked
176

Anesth Prog 63:175–180 2016
 subjects every 10 minutes whether he/she could stand
up after Modified Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring
System score had reached �9. If subjects could stand up
without swaying, then the observer asked them to take 5
steps forward and backward. Time to independent
walking was thus determined. Discharge time was
measured based on Clinical Discharge Criteria.7 Findings
for 24 hours after discharge were obtained by telephone,
based on a questionnaire given to patients at discharge.
After the second dental treatment under general
anesthesia was completed, patients were asked which
anesthetic they would choose for any future dental
treatment under general anesthesia. The time frame was
about 2 weeks between the 2 anesthetics. Obtained data
were analyzed by other researchers who did not observe
the anesthesia and recovery process.
Statistical Analysis
The v2 test was used to analyze occurrence of nausea
and/or vomiting and telephone interview answers about
preferred anesthetic in the future. Anesthetic time data
and time to resume normal activities were analyzed using
Student’s t test for paired samples. Time to eye opening
and patient satisfaction were analyzed using Wilcoxon
signed-rank sum test because these data were not
normally distributed. All values were represented as
mean 6 SD. A P value less than .05 was considered as
statistically significant.
RESULTS
Patient characteristics are shown in Table 1. Although
there were no differences in duration of treatment, type
of dental treatment, patients who received dental
treatment with local anesthesia, total dose of local
anesthetic, duration of anesthesia, or crystalloid transfu-
sion volume between the 2 groups, the number of
patients who received additional rocuronium bromide
and the total dose of rocuronium bromide were greater in
the propofol group than in the sevoflurane group.
Predicted effect site concentration of propofol was 3.8
6 0.5 lg/mL and end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane
was 1.8 6 0.3% during anesthesia (Table 2). The time to
BIS � 75, time to eye opening, and time to extubation
were shorter in the sevoflurane group than in the
propofol group, whereas time to restoration of sponta-
neous respiration was similar in both groups (Table 3).
There were no differences in Aldrete score, Modified
Post Anesthesia Discharge Scoring System score, time
to independent walking, or time to discharge between
the 2 groups. The incidence of nausea in the recovery
phase in the sevoflurane group was 15%, but there were
no incidents of vomiting (Table 4). Intravenous metoclo-
pramide was used for management of nausea where
indicated. There were no incidents of nausea or vomiting
in the propofol group.

 On telephone questioning approximately 24 hours
later, there was no difference in time to first meal and
fluid between 2 groups, and neither nausea nor vomiting
was reported in either group. Based on the subjects’
satisfaction and preference, propofol was evaluated as a
better anesthetic for ambulatory anesthesia than sevo-
flurane (Table 5). The main reasons for the selection of a
preferred anesthetic in the future are shown in Table 6.
DISCUSSION
This study compared the recovery profiles from ambu-
latory anesthesia for dental treatments and patient
satisfaction between propofol and sevoflurane when
used alone to induce and maintain anesthesia given to
the same subjects. We obtained the following results: (a)
The time to emergence was shorter with sevoflurane
anesthesia than with propofol anesthesia, but there was
no difference in time to full recovery. (b) Propofol
anesthesia is preferred over sevoflurane anesthesia in
terms of both patient satisfaction and patient preference
for future anesthesia.
This study was characterized by the following: (a) Each
subject underwent both anesthesia methods. (b) No
coadministered drugs such as nitrous oxide and/or
opioid analgesics were used to maintain general anes-
thesia as these may affect the recovery process. (c) BIS
monitoring was used to maintain a constant depth of
anesthesia, as it has been reported that BIS monitoring
was useful to predict fast-tracking of outpatients.8 (d) A
local anesthetic was administered at the treatment site to
inhibit peripheral nociceptive stimulus.
All previous studies comparing the recovery process-
es of propofol and sevoflurane anesthesia were
performed under concomitant use of analgesics,
including nitrous oxide,9,10 fentanyl,11,12 remifenta-
nil,13–16 and alfentanil.17 However, these studies
indicated inconsistent findings that emergence from
sevoflurane anesthesia was faster than from propofol
anesthesia when either nitrous oxide or remifentanil
was coadministered,9 or that there was no difference
between these agents.1,10,13,15 There are some studies
that report that emergence from propofol anesthesia is
faster than from sevoflurane anesthesia.18,19 The time
to recovery has also been inconsistent among previous
studies. Full recovery to discharge from propofol
anesthesia was faster than from sevoflurane anesthesia
when nitrous oxide was coadministered.10 However,
there was no difference in early recovery variables (eg,
time to eye opening or sitting up) between propofol
anesthesia with nitrous oxide and sevoflurane anesthe-
sia with nitrous oxide.10 When remifentanil was
coadministered, no difference was observed between
the 2 anesthetics.13–16 In our current study, emergence
from sevoflurane-only anesthesia was faster, but there
was no difference in the time to full recovery.
Patient satisfaction is one recent criterion proposed to
evaluate the quality of general anesthesia. Patient
satisfaction after general anesthesia is affected by several
factors, including intraoperative emergence during anes-
thesia, postoperative pain, nausea and vomiting, urinary
bladder catheterization, clarity of wakefulness, and other
postoperative factors.20 In this study, intravenous fluid
was given as slowly as possible to avoid catheterization to
the urinary bladder. In previous studies, patient satisfac-
tion was greater after propofol anesthesia than after
sevoflurane anesthesia, despite several concomitant
analgesics and different evaluation methods,10,14 or
there was no difference.12,13,17 Luntz and colleagues14
reported that the reasons for lower patient satisfaction in
sevoflurane anesthesia included discomfort at induction,
contact and odor of the mask, and nausea and/or
vomiting at a later date. However, in this study, the
telephone interview 24 hours after discharge showed
that 15% of the subjects were dissatisfied with the smell
of sevoflurane, and there were no complaints of nausea
and/or vomiting or postoperative pain. In general,
evaluation of patient satisfaction is scored in multiple
ways, with many using the visual analogue scale. This

 study also used the visual analogue scale, and the results
indicated that patient satisfaction was greater after
propofol anesthesia than after sevoflurane anesthesia.
Patient satisfaction in the previous studies was evaluated
by comparing pooled groups of subjects receiving either
sevoflurane anesthesia or propofol anesthesia. However,
in this crossover study, we believe that the results express
subjective satisfaction more accurately.
According to the previous reports, when patients were
asked at 24 hours1 and 48 hours13 after surgery which
general anesthetic, whether mainly various inhalation
anesthesia or propofol-based anesthesia, they would
prefer at future surgery, almost all patients selected the
same anesthetic.13 However, in other previous studies,
another anesthesia method was requested by 22% of
patients who received tidal breathing induction with
sevoflurane,14 and even 7 days after surgery, by 43% of
patients who received sevoflurane with nitrous oxide.21
Patients with severe anxiety against dental treatments,
like the subjects in this study, probably need general
anesthesia for future dental treatment. Selection of a
preferred anesthetic is important for such patients, and
80% of the subjects in this study selected propofol as
their preferred anesthetic. There was a trend toward an
increased incidence of nausea in the recovery phase in
the sevoflurane group only, with 3 subjects experiencing
nausea without vomiting (P ¼ .072). Furthermore, 5
subjects claimed an uncomfortable sensation, such as
feeling sluggish, and 9 of them claimed fatigue after
sevoflurane anesthesia. This result might contribute to
the preference of propofol for ambulatory anesthesia.
One drawback of our study is that propofol anesthesia
provides less muscle relaxation, which leads to an easier
occurrence of bucking or body movement during dental
treatment. Thus, the number of patients who received
additional rocuronium bromide and the total dose of
rocuronium were greater in the propofol group than in
the sevoflurane group. Repetitive administration of a
short-acting muscle relaxant may extend treatment time.
It should be considered to study a continuous infusion of
muscle relaxants and/or opioid antagonists in future
treatments.
With respect to sample size, for a significance level of
a ¼ .05 and a statistical power of .8, given that the
expected difference between the propofol group (0.8)
and the sevoflurane group (0.2) as to which patients
might select for future dental treatment was 0.6, the
needed sample size was 20, which suggested that the
sample size in this study was adequate.
In conclusion, we performed a crossover study on the
recovery profiles after ambulatory anesthesia with
propofol alone and with sevoflurane alone. There was
no difference in time to discharge between the 2 groups
and no complications were reported 24 hours after
general anesthesia in either group. Higher patient
satisfaction and a greater preference for future dental
treatment with propofol anesthesia were found. We
conclude that propofol may be more suitable for
ambulatory anesthesia for dental treatment where
patient satisfaction is a higher priority.
