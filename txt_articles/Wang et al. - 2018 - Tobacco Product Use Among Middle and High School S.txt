Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States, and nearly all tobacco use begins 
during youth and young adulthood (1,2). CDC and the 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from 
the 2011–2017 National Youth Tobacco Surveys (NYTS)* 
to determine patterns of current (past 30-day) use of seven 
tobacco product types among U.S. middle school (grades 
6–8) and high school (grades 9–12) students and estimate use 
nationwide. Among high school students, current use of any 
tobacco product decreased from 24.2% (estimated 3.69 million 
users) in 2011 to 19.6% (2.95 million) in 2017. Among middle 
school students, current use of any tobacco product decreased 
from 7.5% (0.87 million) in 2011 to 5.6% (0.67 million) in 
2017. In 2017, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) were the 
most commonly used tobacco product among high (11.7%; 
1.73 million) and middle (3.3%; 0.39 million) school students. 
During 2016–2017, decreases in current use of hookah and 
pipe tobacco occurred among high school students, while 
decreases in current use of any tobacco product, e-cigarettes, 
and hookah occurred among middle school students. Current 
use of any combustible tobacco product, ≥2 tobacco products, 
cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco, and bidis did not change 
among middle or high school students during 2016–2017. 
Comprehensive and sustained strategies can help prevent 
and reduce the use of all forms of tobacco products among 
U.S. youths (1,2).
NYTS is a cross-sectional, voluntary, school-based, self-
administered, pencil-and-paper questionnaire survey of U.S. 
middle and high school students. A three-stage cluster sampling 
procedure is used to generate a nationally representative sample 
of U.S. students attending public and private schools in grades 
6–12. Briefly, primary sampling units are selected at the first 
stage, schools are selected at the second stage, and students 
are selected from intact classrooms at each grade level at the 
third stage. This report used data from seven NYTS waves 
(2011–2017). Sample sizes and response rates were 18,766, 
72.7% (2011); 24,658, 73.6% (2012); 18,406, 67.8% (2013); 
22,007, 73.3% (2014); 17,711, 63.4% (2015); 20,675, 71.6% 
(2016); and 17,872, 68.1% (2017).
* https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/surveys/nyts/index.htm.
Participants were asked about current (past 30-day) use of 
cigarettes, cigars, smokeless tobacco,† e-cigarettes,§ hookah,¶ 
pipe tobacco,** and bidis (small imported cigarettes wrapped 
in a leaf). Current use for each product was defined as use on 
≥1 day during the past 30 days. “Any tobacco product use” 
was defined as use of one or more tobacco products in the past 
30 days, and “≥2 tobacco product use” was defined as use of 
two or more tobacco products in the past 30 days. “Any com-
bustible tobacco product use” was defined as use of cigarettes, 
cigars, hookah, pipe tobacco, and/or bidis in the past 30 days.
Data were weighted to account for the complex survey design 
and adjusted for nonresponse. National prevalence estimates 
with 95% confidence intervals and population estimates 
rounded down to the nearest 10,000 were computed. Current 
use estimates for 2017 were determined for any tobacco prod-
uct, ≥2 tobacco products, any combustible tobacco product, 
and each tobacco product individually, overall and by selected 
demographics for each school level (high and middle). The 
 † Beginning in 2015, the definition of smokeless tobacco included chewing 
tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco to better reflect this class of 
tobacco products. Thus, estimates for individual smokeless tobacco products 
(chewing tobacco/snuff/dip, snus, and dissolvable tobacco) are not reported.
 § During 2011–2013, e-cigarette use was assessed by the question “In the past 
30 days, which of the following products have you used on at least one day?” 
and the response option, “Electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes such as Ruyan or 
NJOY.” In 2014, current use of e-cigarettes was assessed by the question “During 
the past 30 days, on how many days did you use e-cigarettes such as Blu, 21st 
Century Smoke, or NJOY?” During 2015–2017, e-cigarette questions were 
preceded by an introductory paragraph defining the product. In 2015, current 
use of e-cigarettes was assessed by the question “During the past 30 days, on 
how many days did you use electronic cigarettes or e-cigarettes?” In 2016 and 
2017, current use of e-cigarettes was assessed by the question “During the past 
30 days, on how many days did you use e-cigarettes?”
 ¶ During 2011–2015, current hookah smoking was assessed by the question 
“In the past 30 days, which of the following products have you used on at 
least one day?” Hookah was the fourth or fifth response option during 
2011–2013, the first option in 2014, and the fourth option in 2015. During 
2016–2017, hookah questions were preceded by an introductory paragraph 
defining the product; current hookah smoking was assessed by the question 
“In the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke tobacco in a hookah 
or waterpipe?”
 
** During 2011–2013, pipe tobacco use was assessed by the question “During 
the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke tobacco in a pipe?” During 
2014–2017, current use of pipe tobacco was assessed by the question “In the 
past 30 days, which of the following products have you used on at least one 
day?” and the response option “Pipes filled with tobacco (not waterpipe).” 
Pipe tobacco was the second response option available in 2014, the fifth option 
in 2015, and the second option during 2016–2017.

presence of linear and quadratic trends during 2011–2017 
were assessed, adjusting for race/ethnicity, sex, and grade.†† 
T-tests were performed to examine differences between 2016 
and 2017. For all analyses, p-values <0.05 were considered 
statistically significant.
 
†† A test for linear trend was significant if an overall statistically significant 
decrease or increase occurred during the study period. Data also were assessed 
for the presence of quadratic trends. A significant quadratic trend indicated 
that the rate of change accelerated or decelerated across the study period.
In 2017, 19.6% of high school students (estimated 
2.95 million users) reported current use of any tobacco prod-
uct, including 9.2% (1.38 million; 46.8% of current tobacco 
product users) who currently used ≥2 tobacco products, and 
12.9% (1.94 million; 65.8% of current tobacco product users) 
who currently used any combustible tobacco product (Table). 
E-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product 
among high school students (11.7%), followed by cigars 
(7.7%), cigarettes (7.6%), smokeless tobacco (5.5%), hookah 
(3.3%), pipe tobacco (0.8%), and bidis (0.7%). Smokeless

 * Past 30-day use of e-cigarettes was determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use e-cigarettes?” Past 30-day use of cigarettes was 
determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?” Past 30-day use of cigars was determined by asking, “During the 
past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigars, cigarillos, or little cigars?” Past 30-day use of hookah was determined by asking, “During the past 30 days, 
on how many days did you smoke tobacco in a hookah or waterpipe?” Smokeless tobacco was defined as use of chewing tobacco, snuff, dip, snus, and/or dissolvable 
tobacco products. Past 30-day use of smokeless tobacco was determined by asking the following question for use of chewing tobacco, snuff, and dip: “During the 
past 30-days, on how many days did you use chewing tobacco, snuff, or dip?,” and the following question for use of snus and dissolvable tobacco products: “In the 
past 30 days, which of the following products did you use on at least one day?” Responses from these questions were combined to derive overall smokeless tobacco 
use. Past 30-day use of pipe tobacco (not hookah) and bidis were determined by asking, “In the past 30 days, which of the following products have you used on at 
least one day?”

tobacco use was higher among males than among females. 
E-cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco product 
among non-Hispanic white (white) (14.2%) and Hispanic 
(10.1%) high school students, whereas cigars were the most 
commonly used tobacco product among non-Hispanic black 
(black) high school students (7.8%).
Among middle school students, 5.6% (0.67 million) 
currently used any tobacco product, including 2.4% 
(0.28 million; 41.8% of current tobacco product users) who 
currently used ≥2 tobacco products, and 3.4% (0.39 million; 
58.2% of current tobacco product users) who currently used 
any combustible tobacco product (Table). The most commonly 
used tobacco product among middle school students was 
e-cigarettes (3.3%), followed by cigarettes (2.1%), smokeless 
tobacco (1.9%), cigars (1.5%), hookah (1.4%), pipe tobacco 
(0.4%), and bidis (0.3%). Any tobacco product use was 6.4% 
among males and 4.8% among females. E-cigarettes were the 
most commonly used product among Hispanic (4.0%), white 
(3.4%), and black (2.2%) middle school students.
Among high school students, a nonlinear decrease occurred 
in the current use of any tobacco product from 2011 (24.2%) 
to 2017 (19.6%). Nonlinear decreases also occurred in the 
current use of ≥2 tobacco products (12.0% to 9.2%) and any 
combustible tobacco product (21.8% to 12.9%). By product, 
linear decreases occurred for cigarettes (15.8% to 7.6%), cigars 
(11.6% to 7.7%), and smokeless tobacco (7.9% to 5.5%);

Discussion
Among U.S. middle and high school students, the current 
use of any tobacco product decreased during 2011–2017. 
However, in 2017, approximately one in five high school 
students (2.95 million) and one in 18 middle school students 
(0.67 million) currently used a tobacco product. Since 2014, 
e-cigarettes have been the most commonly used tobacco prod-
uct among both middle and high school students. Furthermore,

tobacco product and two in five middle school students who 
used a tobacco product reported using ≥2 tobacco products. 
Among youths, symptoms of nicotine dependence are increased 
in multiple tobacco product–users compared with those in 
single product–users (3).
Tobacco prevention and control strategies at the national, 
state, and local levels might have contributed to the reduction 
in any tobacco product use in recent years, including tobacco 
product price increases, comprehensive smoke-free policies, 
media campaigns warning about the risks for youth tobacco 
product use, and youth access restrictions (1,2,4). However, 
several factors continue to promote and influence tobacco 
product use among youths, including exposure to tobacco 
product advertising and imagery through various media, as 
well as the availability of flavored tobacco products (2,5,6). 
Sustained and targeted interventions to address these factors 
could help prevent and reduce all forms of tobacco use among 
U.S. youths (1,2,4). In March 2018, the Food and Drug 
Administration issued an advance notice of proposed rulemak-
ing to obtain information related to the role that flavors play 
in tobacco product use (7).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, findings might not be generalizable to all youths; 
those who are home-schooled, have dropped out of school, 
or are in detention centers are not included in this survey. 
Second, data were self-reported and might be subject to recall 
and response bias. Third, changes in the wording and place-
ment of survey questions for certain tobacco products during 
2011–2017 might limit comparability of responses between 
years. Finally, data on some tobacco products were unavailable 
for certain years (e.g., roll-your-own cigarettes), which might 
result in underestimation of overall tobacco product use.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and 
death in the United States; nearly all tobacco use begins during 
youth and young adulthood.
What is added by this report?
During 2011–2017, prevalence of current use of any tobacco 
product decreased from 24.2% to 19.6% among high school 
students and from 7.5% to 5.6% among middle school students. 
Electronic cigarettes were the most commonly used tobacco 
product among high school (11.7%) and middle school 
students (3.3%) in 2017. 
What are the implications for public health practice?
Sustained implementation of population-based strategies, in 
coordination with Food and Drug Administration regulation of 
tobacco products, are critical to reducing tobacco product use 
and initiation among U.S. youths.
The sustained implementation of population-based 
strategies, in coordination with the regulation of tobacco 
products by FDA (8), are critical to reducing all forms of 
tobacco product use and initiation among U.S. youths (1,2,4). 
Strategies to reduce youth tobacco product use include 
increasing the price of tobacco products, implementing 
comprehensive smoke-free policies, implementing advertising 
and promotion restrictions and national public education 
media campaigns, and raising the minimum age of purchase 
for tobacco products to 21 years (1,4,9).
