IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, a comprehensive study of the survival and causes of death
of persons with synucleinopathies compared with the general population has not been
conducted. Understanding the long-term outcomes of these conditions may inform patients
and caregivers of the expected disease duration and may help with care planning.
OBJECTIVE To compare survival rates and causes of death among patients with incident,
clinically diagnosed synucleinopathies and age- and sex-matched referent participants.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This population-based study used the Rochester
Epidemiology Project medical records–linkage system to identify all residents in Olmsted
County, Minnesota, who received a diagnostic code of parkinsonism from 1991 through 2010.
A movement-disorders specialist reviewed the medical records of each individual to confirm
the presence of parkinsonism and determine the type of synucleinopathy. For each confirmed
patient, an age- and sex-matched Olmsted County resident without parkinsonism was also
identified.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We determined the age- and sex-adjusted risk of death for
each type of synucleinopathy, the median time from diagnosis to death, and the causes of
death.
RESULTS Of the 461 patients with synucleinopathies, 279 (60.5%) were men, and of the 452
referent participants, 272 (60.2%) were men. From 1991 through 2010, 461 individuals
received a diagnosis of a synucleinopathy (309 [67%] of Parkinson disease, 81 [17.6%] of
dementia with Lewy bodies, 55 [11.9%] of Parkinson disease dementia, and 16 [3.5%] of
multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism). During follow-up, 68.6% (n = 316) of the
patients with synucleinopathies and 48.7% (n = 220) of the referent participants died.
Patients with any synucleinopathy died a median of 2 years earlier than referent participants.
Patients with multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism (hazard ratio, 10.51; 95% CI,
2.92-37.82) had the highest risk of death compared with referent participants, followed by
those with dementia with Lewy bodies (hazard ratio, 3.94; 95% CI, 2.61-5.94), Parkinson
disease with dementia (hazard ratio, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.36-6.30), and Parkinson disease (hazard
ratio, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.39-2.21). Neurodegenerative disease was the most frequent cause of
death listed on the death certificate for patients, and cardiovascular disease was the most
frequent cause of death among referent participants.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Individuals with multiple system atrophy with parkinsonism,
dementia with Lewy bodies, and Parkinson disease dementia have increased mortality
compared with the general population. The mortality among persons with Parkinson disease
is only moderately increased compared with the general population.

 T
he aggregation of α-synuclein, a ubiquitous protein in
the nervous system, contributes to Lewy body
formation.1 Diseases defined as synucleinopathies, in-
cluding Parkinson disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB), PD dementia (PDD), and multiple system atrophy
(MSA),2 share the presence of α-synuclein as the pathological
hallmark. Several studies have determined the incidence and
prevalence of these diseases.2-5 However, few studies have ex-
amined survival rates among patients with synucleino-
pathies after symptom onset compared with the general
population.2
A recent study showed decreased survival rates among pa-
tientswithMSAandparkinsonismcomparedwithpatientswith
PD.6 To our knowledge, however, no comprehensive compari-
son of the survival rates and causes of death of persons with
different types of synucleinopathies (PD, DLB, PDD, and MSA)
in the general population has been performed. Understand-
ing the long-term outcomes of these conditions may inform
patients and caregivers of the expected disease duration and
facilitate care planning.
Toaddressquestionsofsurvivalandcausesofdeathinthese
diseases, we used an incident study of synucleinopathy–
associated clinical syndromes (PD, DLB, PDD, and MSA-p [MSA
with parkinsonism]) occurring from 1991 to 2010 and age- and
sex-matched referent participants living in Olmsted County,
Minnesota. We compared survival rates of patients with inci-
dent disease with those of referent participants and described
their causes of deaths.
Methods
Ascertaining Patients With Synucleinopathy
Details about ascertaining patients with parkinsonism are re-
ported elsewhere.2,7 Briefly, we used the medical records–
linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project to iden-
tify all individuals in Olmsted County, Minnesota, with a
clinically diagnosed synucleinopathy with parkinsonism be-
tween 1991 and 2010. The Rochester Epidemiology Project
infrastructure indexes and links all medical information of the
individuals in the county population.8-11 All medical diagno-
ses, surgical interventions, and other procedures are ab-
stracted and entered into computerized indexes using the
Hospital Adaptation of the International Classification of Dis-
eases, Eighth Revision (H-ICDA)12 and the International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).13
We ascertained potential cases of parkinsonism using a
computerized screening phase and a subsequent clinical-
confirmation phase.2,7 The complete medical records of all
people receiving at least 1 screening diagnostic code for par-
kinsonism were reviewed by a movement disorders special-
ist (R.S.) using specifically designed abstracting forms and in-
struction manuals. The movement disorders specialist
established the onset year and type of parkinsonism using
specified diagnostic criteria.2,14-17 We included patients resid-
ing in Olmsted County at the time of parkinsonian-symptom
onset but excluded people who denied permission to use their
medical records for research purposes.8 Further details about
case-finding procedures are published elsewhere.16,18 The in-
stitutional review boards of the Mayo Clinic and the Olmsted
Medical Center approved the study. Written informed con-
sent was waived because it was a passive medical record
review.10
Diagnostic Criteria
Our diagnostic adjudication included 2 steps: defining parkin-
sonism as a syndrome and defining different types of parkin-
sonism within the syndrome. We defined parkinsonism as
the presence of at least 2 of 4 cardinal signs: rest tremor,
bradykinesia, rigidity, and impaired postural reflexes. Among
persons fulfilling the parkinsonism criteria, we applied diag-
nostic criteria for specific types of parkinsonism and grouped
patientswithparkinsonismintopresumedsynucleinopathies.2
Parkinson disease was defined as parkinsonism with all
3 of the following: no other cause (eg, repeated stroke with
stepwise progression, repeated head injury, a history of
encephalitis, neuroleptic treatment within 6 months before
onset, hydrocephalus, or a brain tumor), no documented
unresponsiveness to levodopa at doses of at least 1 g/d in
combination with carbidopa (applicable only to treated
patients), and no prominent or early (within 1 year of onset)
signs of more extensive nervous system involvement (eg,
dysautonomia) that was not explained otherwise.16 We used
previously published consensus criteria to diagnose DLB,
PDD, and MSA.2,7,19,20
Ourcase-findingprocedureshaveprovenreliable.2Wealso
reviewed available autopsy reports of all patients who died
during the study to validate our classification of presumed sy-
nucleinopathies and tauopathies and found an 81.5% clinico-
pathological agreement.2
Ascertaining Referent Participants
Each patient with clinically defined synucleinopathy was
individuallymatchedbyage(±1year)andsextoageneralpopu-
lation referent participant residing in Olmsted County, Min-
nesota, who was free of parkinsonism and tremor of any type
in the year of onset of the synucleinopathy. The medical
records–linkage system provided a list of all the county resi-
dents from whom potential referent participants were
Key Points
Question What is the comparison between survival rates and
causes of death among patients with incident, clinically diagnosed
synucleiopathies, and age- and sex-matched referent participants?
Findings In this population-based study, individuals with multiple
system atrophy with parkinsonism, dementia with Lewy bodies,
Parkinson disease, and Parkinson disease dementia had increased
mortality compared with the general population, and patients with
multiple system atrophy with predominant parkinsonism had the
highest risk followed by dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson
disease dementia, and Parkinson disease.
Meaning Because survival rates and the causes of death vary
across the clinically diagnosed synucleinopathies, an individualized
approach to prognosing the different diseases is warranted.

 randomly drawn. This list was compared with a random-digit-
dialing telephone sample and with the US census data and was
shown to be complete.21,22
A nurse abstractor reviewed the records of potential ref-
erent participants and flagged any possible parkinsonism,
tremor, or related diagnoses. A neurologist (R.S.) then re-
viewed the record of the potential referent participant to
exclude the presence of PD, other types of parkinsonism, or
tremor before or during the year of synucleinopathy onset in
the matched patient with parkinsonism. A panel of move-
ment disorders specialists (R.S., J.H.B.) adjudicated any indi-
vidual with diagnostic uncertainties. Potential referent par-
ticipants with confirmed parkinsonism or a tremor before the
index year of the synucleinopathy were excluded and poten-
tial replacement participants were randomly selected and
screened. Referent participants with other neurologic dis-
eases were not excluded.
Data Analysis
Patients with presumed synucleinopathies and the age- and
sex-matched referent participants included in this study were
originally identified for a case-control study nested within a
cohort.2Therefore,thecasesweresampledconditionallybased
on being alive at the onset of the synucleinopathy (onset year)
and on the date of diagnosis (diagnosis date). Onset was de-
fined as the first identification of parkinsonian symptoms in
the medical records. By contrast, controls were selected con-
ditionally only based on being alive in the year of onset of the
synucleinopathy in the matched case. To avoid an immortal-
ity bias (people who died before diagnosis), we started sur-
vival analyses for both patients and referent participants at the
date of the diagnosis rather than the year of onset. We as-
signed referent participants the same index date (date of di-
agnosis) as their matched cases and excluded from analyses
referent participants who died between the onset year and the
diagnosis date (n = 9). The original matching of cases and ref-
erent participants was not considered in the survival analy-
ses, and age at diagnosis and sex were included as covariates
in the models to remove residual confounding.
We followed-up patients and referent participants until
they were lost to follow-up, until June 30, 2015 (the end of the
study), or until death (whichever occurred first). Persons who
werealiveonJune30,2015,orwhowerelosttofollow-up,were
censored at the date that they were last known to be alive. We
constructedKaplan-Meiersurvivalcurveswithdeathfromany
cause as the event of interest. We used Cox proportional haz-
ards models, with age as the time scale, to calculate hazard ra-
tios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals of death among pa-
tients with synucleinopathies (overall and separately by type)
compared with referent participants. All statistical testing was
done at 2-tailed α levels of .05. The proportionality assump-
tion was tested visually and by including a time-dependent
coefficientintheCoxproportionalhazardsmodels.23Allanaly-
ses were completed using Stata, version 12.0 (StataCorp).
Results
We identified 461 patients who had an onset of a clinically pre-
sumedsynucleinopathymanifestingasparkinsonismfrom1991
through 2010. Of these, 309 (67%) received a diagnosis of PD,
81 (18%) of DLB, 55 (125) of PDD, and 16 (3%) of MSA-p. One
referent participant was initially age- and sex-matched to each
patient; however, 9 referent participants died between the on-
set year and diagnosis date. Thus, our final analyses included
461 patients with incident synucleinopathies and 452 refer-
ent participants.
The median (interquartile range [IQR]) lag time between
the date of onset and the date of the diagnosis of all synucle-
inopathies was 0.50 (0.01-1.22) years. Table 1 shows the char-
acteristics of the patients and the referent participants strati-
fied by the type of synucleinopathy. Of the 461 patients, 279
(60.5%) were men. The median age at parkinsonian symp-
tom onset for all cases was 75.8 years (IQR, 67.4-81.7 years),

 and the median age at death was 84.7 years (IQR, 79.3-89.7).
The median age at symptom onset did not differ by sex (P = .17,

(60.2%) were men. Their median age at the index date was 75.6

(HR, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.36-6.30), and PD (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.39-

vival curves using the year of onset rather than the date of the
diagnosis and found no noticeable differences compared with
the primary analyses. However, there was an inversion of the
curves in the first 1 to 2 years because of the immortality bias.
In additional analyses, we searched for an interaction with sex
and age in predicting survival rates but did not find a signifi-
cant interaction for any type of synucleinopathy.
Lastly, we compared the causes of death between the pa-
tients and the referent participants (Table 3). We categorized
the causes of death into respiratory failure/ pneumonia,
acute and chronic cardiovascular events (pooled), stroke/
hemorrhages, cancers (of all types), renal failure, aspiration,
neurodegenerative diseases (dementia, PD, Alzheimer dis-
ease, etc), traumas (including falls), sepsis, and other causes
ofdeath(Table3).Neurodegenerativediseasewasthemostfre-
quent cause of death among patients for all synucleinopa-
thies (31.5%) and in PD alone (25.6%). Cardiovascular events
were the second most common cause of death (15.7%). These
results were consistent with the causes of death observed
among patients with DLB, PDD, and MSA-p. However, the
sample size was limited to observe a sufficient number of
events. Among referent participants, cardiovascular events
were the most common cause of death (25.5%).
Discussion
Our study suggests that an increased risk of mortality exists
for individuals with clinically defined synucleinopathies com-
pared with age- and sex-matched referent participants. Over-
all, patients with synucleinopathies died 2 years earlier than
referentparticipants.Whenstratifiedbysynucleinopathytype,
patientswithMSA-pdied6yearsearlier,patientswithDLBdied
4 years earlier, patients with PDD died 3.5 years earlier, and
patients with PD died 1 year earlier than the respective refer-
ent participants. In additional analyses, we compared the
causes of death as listed in the death certificates of patients
and participants. Neurodegenerative disease appeared most
frequently among patients with clinically diagnosed synucle-
inopathies,whereascardiovasculardiseaseswerethemostfre-
quent cause of death among referent participants.

 Our findings are consistent with the findings from a pre-
vious report in the Olmsted County population that exam-
ined patients with incident PD and matched referent partici-
pants from 1976 to 1995.24 The relative risk of death for PD was
1.6 (95% CI, 1.2-2.1), which is consistent with the 1.75-fold in-
creased risk (95% CI, 1.39-2.21) observed for the period from
1991 to 2010. We avoided overlapping the 2 studies by remov-
ingthepatientswithPDfromthe1991to2010periodwhowere
already included in the 1976 to 1995 period. Thus, the risk of
death after a PD diagnosis seems relatively stable across a 30-
year time span. Another cohort study also reported a similar
2-fold increased mortality risk for patients with PD compared
with matched referents.25 By contrast, other studies have re-
ported a decreased risk of mortality among patients with
PD.26,27 However, these studies were based mostly on preva-
lent cases of PD (rather than incident cases) and included small
numbers of patients with PD.
Few studies have examined the risk of death after a
diagnosis of other types of synucleinopathies, and those
that have are primarily based on clinical series and are not
population-based. A pathology-confirmed series of patients
with DLB and PDD combined showed a median survival of 5
years from symptom onset.28 The results of a large prospec-
tive clinical series of MSA showed that the presence of par-
kinsonism in MSA was associated with shorter survival and
a higher risk of death.29 By contrast, a meta-analysis on
pathologically proven cases of MSA did not confirm shorter
survival in MSA.30 Few studies have compared survival
across synucleinopathies. One study recently reported a
6-fold increased risk of mortality among patients with
MSA-p compared with patients with PD. The patients with
PD lived approximately 8 years longer than the patients
with MSA-p (7.5 years in MSA vs 15.8 years in PD).6 These
results are consistent with our study showing that patients
with MSA-p have a 10-fold greater risk of death compared
with referent participants and the shortest survival rates
after symptom onset when compared with all other types of
synucleinopathies.
Given the diagnostic challenges, few studies to our knowl-
edge have examined mortality in DLB and PDD. However, pa-

 tients with PD with dementia have a faster progression than
those without.19,31-33 Patients with DLB have a faster progres-
sion than Alzheimer disease34 as well as a shorter time to dis-
ability and death.35-37 A previous study listed the median sur-
vival time of patients with DLB as approximately 7 years from
diagnosis,38 which is longer than the observed median sur-
vival in our study of about 4.7 years for patients with DLB and
3.8 years for patients with PDD. A possible explanation for the
difference is that the previous study defined disease dura-
tionasfromcognitive-symptomonsetratherthanfromthedate
of the clinical diagnosis.
In additional analyses, we compared the underlying
causes of death found among patients with synucleinopa-
thies and referent participants as listed in their death certifi-
cates. Despite recognizing the limitations of death certifi-
cates, we found neurodegeneration to be the most common
underlying cause of death in all clinically defined synuclein-
opathies, including patients with PD. Cardiovascular events
were the second most frequent underlying cause of death.
The frequencies of underlying causes of death across the
different types of synucleinopathies appear similar. Inter-
estingly, respiratory diseases, infection, cardiovascular dis-
ease, and neurodegenerative diseases are the most common
causes of death among elderly people in the United States.39
Among referent participants, the most frequent cause of
death was a cardiovascular event (25.5%), followed by can-
cer (18.1%). Our findings on causes of death are consistent
with the growing evidence of possible inverse comorbidi-
ties. Among patients with neurodegenerative diseases,
some studies have reported a lower than expected
frequency of cancer. A proposed explanation is that
neurodegeneration—in this case, synuclein-related
neurodegeneration—may be associated with a reduced risk
of cancer.40 However, other studies reported an increased
risk of nonmelanoma cancers after the diagnosis of PD41;
and melanoma has also been associated with PD and with
the long-term use of L-Dopa.42 Additional studies are
needed to understand the relationship between cancer and
neurodegenerative diseases. Notably, we observed a higher
number of falls among the referent group who were not
affected by synucleinopathies. While additional research is
needed, a possible explanation is that the patients with
synucleinopathies were more aware and more educated on
the risk of falls and therefore more cautious and less likely
to have major consequences of falls compared with referent
participants.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths. First, we included all inci-
dent cases of synucleinopathy from a defined population
over a defined time window and age- and sex-matched refer-
ent participants who were derived from the same population
and time window. Thus, the referral bias should be
minimal.43 Most previous studies were hospital-based and
more likely to recruit advanced or atypical cases. Addition-
ally, other studies examining mortality among patients with
synucleinopathies included prevalent cases, had smaller
sample sizes, and included only some clinical subtypes.6,44
One study only included men.45 Second, previous studies
primarily evaluated survival from the study enrollment date
rather than from the date of the diagnosis, a design that may
overestimate relative mortality. However, we performed
analyses using the year of onset rather than date of the diag-
nosis and found no noticeable differences. Third, our investi-
gation can be interpreted as a long-term, prognostic study of
synucleinopathies. We followed up 68.6% of patients and
48.7% of referents through death. We obtained survival esti-
mates from diagnosis, which is longer than in most previous
studies (6.3 years for patients; 8.3 years for referent partici-
pants). Fifth, our study explored synucleinopathies as a
group and also as separate types including PD, PDD, DLB, and
MSA-p. Therefore, we established mortality risks for all 4
clinically presumed synucleinopathies. Finally, we studied a
relatively stable population using a population-based
records-linkage system that encompassed all medical facili-
ties in Olmsted County, Minnesota. A movement disorders
specialist adjudicated all of the patients at the time of
abstraction to reduce diagnostic-criteria differences over
time or among different specialists.
Our study also has limitations. First, assessing the pre-
cise chronology of symptoms, time of onset of clinical fea-
tures, severity of parkinsonian symptoms, and treatment

 history from an historical review of medical records can be
difficult. Second, cases of DLB presenting without parkin-
sonism were not identified by our methods. However, given
that parkinsonism is present among most patients with
DLB, especially after some years into the disease process,
we most likely did not overlook a large number of patients.
Third, our study population was relatively small, which lim-
its the stability of estimates, particularly for less common
diseases such as MSA-p.
Conclusions
We found that an increased mortality risk exists for all types
of synucleinopathies compared with the general population.
Our findings contribute important new evidence about the
natural history and survival of people affected by synuclein-
opathies of various types. Our results may be helpful to guide
clinicians counseling patients and caregivers.
