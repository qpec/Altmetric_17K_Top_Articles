Abstract
Background
Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may help cigarette smokers quit smoking, yet they may
also facilitate cigarette smoking for never-smokers. We quantify the balance of health bene-
fits and harms associated with e-cigarette use at the population level.
Methods and findings
Monte Carlo stochastic simulation model. Model parameters were drawn from census
counts, national health and tobacco use surveys, and published literature. We calculate the
expected years of life gained or lost from the impact of e-cigarette use on smoking cessation
among current smokers and transition to long-term cigarette smoking among never smokers
for the 2014 US population cohort.
Results
The model estimated that 2,070 additional current cigarette smoking adults aged 25–69
(95% CI: -42,900 to 46,200) would quit smoking in 2015 and remain continually abstinent
from smoking for �7 years through the use of e-cigarettes in 2014. The model also esti-
mated 168,000 additional never-cigarette smoking adolescents aged 12–17 and young
adults aged 18–29 (95% CI: 114,000 to 229,000), would initiate cigarette smoking in 2015
and eventually become daily cigarette smokers at age 35–39 through the use of e-cigarettes
in 2014. Overall, the model estimated that e-cigarette use in 2014 would lead to 1,510,000
years of life lost (95% CI: 920,000 to 2,160,000), assuming an optimistic 95% relative harm
reduction of e-cigarette use compared to cigarette smoking. As the relative harm reduction
decreased, the model estimated a greater number of years of life lost. For example, the
model estimated-1,550,000 years of life lost (95% CI: -2,200,000 to -980,000) assuming an

Conclusions
Based on the existing scientific evidence related to e-cigarettes and optimistic assumptions
about the relative harm of e-cigarette use compared to cigarette smoking, e-cigarette use
currently represents more population-level harm than benefit. Effective national, state, and
local efforts are needed to reduce e-cigarette use among youth and young adults if e-ciga-
rettes are to confer a net population-level benefit in the future.
Introduction
The use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) has become intensely controversial since their
introduction to the US in 2007 [1–7]. E-cigarettes might help the 40 million current adult ciga-
rette smokers quit—the vast majority of whom want to stop smoking completely—by deliver-
ing nicotine with the same sensory experience as combustible, or traditional, cigarettes but
without inhalation of as many toxicants [8–12]. Conversely, e-cigarettes might facilitate the
transition to traditional cigarette smoking among never-smoking adolescents and young
adults [13–21]. This harm is potentially substantial because youth e-cigarette use has risen rap-
idly over time [6,22,23]. For example, past 30-day use of e-cigarettes increased from 1.5% in
2011 to 11.3% in 2016 among high school students and exceeded their level of past 30-day use
of traditional cigarettes (8.0% in 2016) [24].
The controversy over e-cigarettes persists because we do not yet know if e-cigarette use
results in more benefit than harm at the population level [25–27]. This uncertainty creates a
quandary for the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which recently asserted its regula-
tory authority over e-cigarettes and developed regulations to promote their safety and limit
youth appeal [28]. Quantifying the balance of benefits and harms of e-cigarette use requires
simultaneous accounting of the additional number of (1) current cigarette smokers who will
quit through the use of e-cigarettes and (2) never-cigarette smokers who will initiate cigarette
smoking through the use of e-cigarettes, a substantial proportion of whom may become long-
term daily cigarette smokers. A recent study concluded a net population-level health benefit
under a scenario in which e-cigarette use increases in the future only among cigarette smokers
interested in quitting, and net harm under a scenario in which e-cigarette use increases in the
future only among youth who would have never smoked [29]. A second study modeled future
cigarette and e-cigarette use patterns over the next decade for young adults aged 18–24 years
and concluded that e-cigarette use would have a limited impact on the prevalence of current
cigarette smoking [30]. However, this study did not assess the effect of e-cigarette use among
adolescents or adults aged �25 years. A third study estimated the population impact of e-ciga-
rettes on smoking cessation and found e-cigarettes could increase the number of smokers who
successfully quit for one year. However, this study also did not assess the effect of e-cigarette
use among adolescents [31]. Thus, these last two studies could not determine the balance of
benefits and harms of e-cigarette use at the population level.
In this study, we developed a Monte Carlo stochastic simulation model that extends prior
research in two ways. First, we simultaneously consider multiple population subgroups includ-
ing current cigarette smokers and never cigarette smokers. Second, we quantify the net popu-
lation benefits (or harms) of e-cigarette use in terms of the total number of years of life gained

 among additional current cigarette smokers who quit smoking and years of life lost among
additional cigarette smoking initiators who become long-term daily cigarette smokers, both
through the use of e-cigarettes. We base our calculations on 2014 US census data, national
health or tobacco use surveys on e-cigarette use, and published randomized trials and cohort
studies on the e-cigarette associated transition probabilities of cigarette smoking cessation and
initiation.
Methods
Analytic model
Our analytic approach consists of two main steps (Fig 1). The first step estimates the number
of years of life gained among the additional number of current cigarette smokers who quit
smoking through the use of e-cigarettes as a cessation tool, compared to those who did not use
e-cigarettes as a cessation tool, and remain continually abstinent from smoking for �7 years.
We set the threshold for continual abstinence at 7 years because cohort studies found that
relapse beyond this point is rare [32,33]. Additionally, the risk of death among former cigarette
smokers who quit for this long begins to approximate the risk of death among never cigarette
smokers [34]. We began with the US adult population of 25–69 year olds in 2014 (in five-year
age groups) and multiplied these counts by the: (1) age-group-specific prevalence of current
cigarette smoking, (2) age-group-specific prevalence of trying to quit smoking within the past
year among current cigarette smokers, (3) age-group-specific prevalence of current e-cigarette
use among current cigarette smokers who tried quitting within the past year, (4) difference in
the transition probability of �6-month cigarette smoking cessation between current smokers
who used e-cigarettes as a cessation tool and current smokers who did not use e-cigarettes as a
cessation tool, (5) probability of 1 year of cigarette smoking abstinence from cigarette smoking
given �6 months of cigarette smoking abstinence, (6) probability of �6 years of abstinence

 from cigarette smoking given 1 year of cigarette smoking abstinence, and (7) age-group-spe-
cific number of years of life gained from quitting cigarette smoking. We assumed 95% relative
harm reduction of e-cigarette use, compared to cigarette smoking, among current cigarette
smokers who used e-cigarettes as a cessation tool and quit smoking [35]. As described below,
we vary the relative harm of e-cigarette use, compared to cigarette smoking, to include the lev-
els of relative harm inferred from in vitro and mouse model studies [36,37].
The second step estimates the number of years of life lost among the additional number of
never-cigarette smoking adolescents and young adults who eventually become current daily
cigarette smokers (and also smoked �100 cigarettes in lifetime) at age 35–39 through the use
of e-cigarettes. We began with the US adolescent and young adult population of 12–29 year
olds in 2014 (by single year of age) and multiplied these counts by the: (1) age-specific preva-
lence of never cigarette smoking, (2) age-specific prevalence of ever having tried e-cigarettes
among never cigarette smokers, (3) the difference in the transition probability of cigarette
smoking initiation among never cigarette smoking adolescents and young adults who had ever
used e-cigarettes, compared to the corresponding probability among those who had never
used e-cigarettes, (4) probability of becoming a current daily cigarette smoker at age 35–39
based on the age of cigarette smoking initiation, and (5) age-specific number of years of life
lost from current daily cigarette smoking at age 35–39.
We assessed three outcomes of interest: (1) the additional number of current cigarette
smokers who will quit smoking through the current use of e-cigarettes and abstain from smok-
ing for �7 years, compared to those who do not currently use e-cigarettes and (2) the addi-
tional number of adolescents and young adults who will initiate cigarette smoking through the
ever use of e-cigarettes and eventually become daily cigarette smokers at age 35–39, compared
to those who never used e-cigarettes; and (3) the total number of expected years of life gained
or lost across all these population subgroups.
Table 1 describes the data source of each model parameter. S1 Appendix describes how
the difference in transition probabilities of �6-month cigarette smoking cessation between cur-
rent e-cigarette users and non-current e-cigarette users was estimated based on various parame-
ters such as the proportion of current cigarette smokers who used pharmaceutical aids during
quit attempt and the pooled odds ratio of quitting smoking among smokers interested in quit-
ting reported by the meta-analysis of Kalkhoran & Glantz [38]. S2 Appendix describes the esti-
mation of the difference in transition probabilities of cigarette smoking initiation between
never cigarette smokers who ever used e-cigarettes compared to those who never used e-ciga-
rettes based on the pooled odds ratio of cigarette smoking initiation reported by the meta-analy-
sis of Soneji et al. [19]. Tables A and B in S3 Appendix show the value of each model parameter.
Validation of model
We validated the model against one-year intermediate outcomes (e.g., the number of adoles-
cents and young adult cigarette smoking initiators). For current adult smokers, we applied the
model to 2013 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data to predict the number of current
cigarette smoking adults (both current and non-current e-cigarette users) who would quit in
2014 and remain continually abstinent from smoking for �6 months. We then compared this
predicted number with the observed number in 2014, estimated from 2014 NHIS data, by
identifying new �6-month quitters as respondents who answered six months to one year to
the question: “How long has it been since you quit smoking cigarettes?”. For adolescent and
young adult never smokers, we applied the model to 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and
Health (NSDUH) data to predict the number of cigarette smoking initiators in 2014 (both ever
and never e-cigarette users). We then compared this predicted number with the observed

who answered “yes” to the question: “Have you smoked part or all of a cigarette?” and whose
current age was �1 year less than the age at which they first smoked a cigarette (“How old
were you the first time you smoked part or all of a cigarette?”).
Analytic considerations and sensitivity analyses
To account for uncertainty in the prevalence and transition probability parameters, we utilized
Monte Carlo simulation and independently drew from normal distributions with the means
and standard deviations equal to the parameters’ means and standard errors shown in Tables
A and B in S3 Appendix. We repeated this process 100,000 times to create a distribution of
each outcome of interest.
We conducted a sensitivity analysis by varying the level of four key parameters: (1) the
adjusted odds ratio of smoking cessation, (2) the adjusted odds ratio of cigarette smoking initi-
ation, (3) age-group-specific prevalence of current e-cigarette use among current cigarette
smokers who tried quitting within the past year, and (4) age-specific prevalence of ever having
tried e-cigarettes among never cigarette smokers. We also calculated the probability of positive
total years of life gained across a wide range of possible values for these four parameters. For
example, we supposed the adjusted odds ratio of smoking cessation equaled 2.5 times the base-
line estimate (2.15 = 2.5 x 0.86) and recalculated the years of life gained, drawing all other
parameters from their baseline distributions. The probability of a positive total years of life
gained under this supposition equaled the ratio of the (1) number of simulations that yielded a
positive value and (2) total number of simulations (100,000). Finally, we varied from 0% to
100% the relative harm of e-cigarette use, compared to cigarette smoking, in terms of the num-
ber of years of life gained from quitting cigarette smoking. We used R, Version 3.2.3 for all
analyses. Results of years of life gained were determined to be statistical significant if their 95%
confidence intervals do not contain zero.

 Results
Additional quitters and initiators
In 2014, 3,490,000 current adult cigarette smokers who had attempted to quit smoking in the
past year had also currently used e-cigarettes. Additionally, 3,640,000 never-cigarette smoking
adolescents and young adults had ever used e-cigarettes.
The model estimated that 2,070 additional current cigarette smoking adults (95% CI:
-42,900 to 46,200) who currently used e-cigarettes in 2014 would quit smoking in 2015 and
remain continually abstinent from smoking for �7 years using e-cigarettes, compared to those
who did not currently use e-cigarettes (Fig 2). The model also estimated that an additional
168,000 never-cigarette smoking adolescents and young adults in 2014 (95% CI: 114,000 to
229,000) who had ever used e-cigarettes would initiate cigarette smoking in 2015 and eventually
become daily cigarette smokers at age 35–39, compared to those who had never used e-cigarettes.
Years of life gained
The model estimated that the 2,070 additional long-term quitters would gain -3,000 years of
life (95% CI: -351,000 to 325,000). The model also estimated the additional 168,000 adolescent
and young adult cigarette smoking initiators who eventually become daily cigarette smokers at
age 35–39 will lose 1,510,000 years of life (95% CI: 1,030,000 to 2,060,000). Thus, considering

 all population subgroups, the model estimated that e-cigarette use in 2014 would lead to
1,510,000 years of life lost (95% CI: 920,000 to 2,160,000; Fig 3) assuming an approximate 95%
relative harm reduction of e-cigarette use compared to cigarette smoking.
Sensitivity analysis
Our results were sensitive to the adjusted odds ratios of cigarette smoking cessation and ciga-
rette smoking initiation (Table 2). The model estimated that e-cigarette use in 2014 would lead
to 1,150,000 years of life lost (95% CI: 2,130,000 to 242,000) under the relative risk of smoking
cessation estimated by Bullen et al. (transformed to an odds ratio). The model estimated that e-
cigarette use in 2014 would lead to 1,330,000 years of life lost (95% CI: 1,950,000 to 780,000)
and 1,150,000 years of life lost (95% CI: 1,730,000 to 620,000) if the adjusted odds ratio of ciga-
rette smoking initiation decreased by 10% and 20%, respectively. Our results were also sensitive
to the prevalence of current e-cigarette use among current cigarette smokers who tried quitting
within the past year and ever e-cigarette use and never cigarette smokers. Finally, we varied the
health risks of e-cigarette use as a percentage of the risk associated with cigarette smoking. The
total number of years of life lost increased as the relative harm of e-cigarette use, compared to
cigarette smoking, grew (Fig 4). The model estimated that e-cigarette use in 2014 would lead to
1,530,000 years of life lost (95% CI: 2,180,000 to 960,000) and 1,580,000 years of life lost (95%
CI: 2,250,000 to 1,020,000) if the health risks of e-cigarette use were 10%-20% (i.e., 80%-90%
safer) and 40%-50% (i.e., 50%-60% safer) of the risks of cigarette smoking, respectively.

 The probability of a positive total number of years of life gained increased with the relative
risk of smoking cessation: 6.7%, 44.6%, and 83.3% as the relative risk increased to 2.0, 2.5, and
3.0, respectively (Fig 5, Panel A). The probability also increased with higher prevalence of cur-
rent e-cigarette use among current cigarette smokers (Fig 5, Panel B). Conversely, the proba-
bility increased to 0.0%, 0.0%, and 47.6% as the adjusted odds ratio decreased to 3.0, 2.0, and
1.0, respectively (Fig 5, Panel C). Finally, the probability increased with lower prevalence of
ever e-cigarette use among never cigarette smokers (Fig 5, Panel D).
Model validation
Based on 2013 NHIS data, we predicted 1.2 million current cigarette smoking adults would
have quit and remained continually abstinent from smoking for �6 months in 2014 (95% CI,
1.0 to 1.4 million), which was not statistically different (p = 0.57) from the estimated number
from the 2014 NHIS data (1.1 million, 95% CI: 0.9 to 1.3 million). Based on 2013 NSDUH
data, we predicted that 5.5 million adolescents and young adults would have initiated cigarette
smoking in 2014 (95% CI: 4.0 to 6.9 million), which was not statistically different (p = 0.53)
from the observed number from 2014 NSDUH data (5.0 million, 95% CI: 4.1 to 5.9 million).
Discussion
Our study developed a Monte Carlo stochastic simulation model to assess the balance of health
benefits and harms of e-cigarette use at the population level. Based on the most up-to-date
published evidence, our model estimated that e-cigarette use in 2014 represents a population-

 level harm of about 1.6 million years of life lost over the lifetime of all adolescent and young
adult never-cigarette smokers and adult current cigarette smokers in the 2014 US population.
Our model also estimated even greater population-level harm if e-cigarette use confers long-
term health risks.
Our study is consistent with Kalkhoran & Glantz (2015), who estimated the effects of e-cig-
arette use on cessation among smokers and on cigarette smoking initiation by never-smokers
under various scenarios [29]. For example, their study found the largest relative health costs
occurred in the scenario under which e-cigarette use increased among never-smokers because
of the resulting increase in cigarette smoking initiation and the dual use of cigarettes and e-cig-
arettes, while e-cigarette use remained unchanged among established smokers. Our study also
supports the conclusion of Cherng et al. (2016) on the relative effects of e-cigarettes on smok-
ing initiation and cessation [39]. Our model indicates that the odds of smoking initiation
among e-cigarette users would need to decrease more than the odds of smoking cessation
would need to increase to achieve the same change in the total number of years of life gained.
Our conclusions differ from those of Levy et al. (2016), Levy et al. (2017), and Hill & Cama-
cho (2017)—a tobacco industry-funded study [40–42]. Hill & Camacho found the use of e-cig-
arettes would result in a decrease in smoking-related mortality in the UK from 8.4% to 8.1% in
2050 [40]. Levy et al. found that the use of vaporized nicotine products (VNPs; e.g., e-ciga-
rettes) would lead to years of life gained for the US birth cohort of 1997 as it ages over time
[41]. Hill & Camacho estimated an “overall beneficial effect from launching e-cigarettes”, in
part, because they explicitly assumed the transition probability of cigarette smoking initiation
among never cigarette smokers who used e-cigarettes equaled 5% [40]. Levy et al. (2016) esti-
mated a “positive public health impact” from VNP use, in part, because they implicitly
assumed the odds of cigarette smoking initiation was only marginally higher for ever e-ciga-
rette users than never e-cigarette users (odds ratio�1.16) among adolescents and young adults

 who would not have become a cigarette smoker in the absence of VNPs. Yet, both of these
assumptions are substantially different from empirical estimates of these parameters from thir-
teen published cohort studies with a combined sample size of over 44,000 respondents [13–

 18,20,21,43–47]. Levy et al. (2017) estimates a substantial number of years of life gained from
e-cigarette use, in part, because they explicitly assumed e-cigarette use among never cigarette
smokers does not increase the rate of cigarette smoking initiation, which—again—contrasts
with growing scientific evidence to the contrary. Nevertheless, these models provide useful
conceptual frameworks to assess the net benefits of e-cigarette use and would likely yield sub-
stantively different conclusions under alternative—and empirically based—assumptions of e-
cigarette use and cigarette smoking initiation.
E-cigarettes could, indeed, confer a positive population benefit if they were more effective
as a smoking cessation device. For example, if current smokers who used e-cigarettes as a smok-
ing cessation tool achieved six-month smoking abstinence at a rate of approximately 2.55 times
greater than their counterparts who did not use e-cigarettes, then our model estimated that the
probability of a positive total number of years of life gained would approach 50%. However, the
estimated effectiveness of e-cigarettes for smoking cessation from all published randomized tri-
als and nearly all cohort studies fall well below this threshold including some studies that con-
cluded cigarette smokers who used e-cigarettes were less—not more—likely to quit than those
who used standard clinic-based smoking cessation treatments [11,38,48–65]. Three cohort stud-
ies of current cigarette smokers did, indeed, estimate relative risks of smoking cessation above
this threshold among intensive e-cigarette users (daily use for at least one month), daily tank e-
cigarette users, and long-term (i.e., �2-year) e-cigarette users [59,66,67]. However, the preva-
lence of intensive e-cigarette use, daily e-cigarette tank use, and long-term e-cigarette use were
low in these studies: only 34% of e-cigarette users were intensive users, 12% of e-cigarette users
were daily e-cigarette tank users, and 14% of e-cigarette users were long-term users [59,66,67].
A decline in public acceptability of cigarette smoking has been accompanied by proscrip-
tions on where smoking is allowed [68,69]. Nearly two-thirds of e-cigarette users reported
using them when and where cigarette smoking was not allowed [70,71]. Further, an analysis of
e-cigarette tweets highlighted that e-cigarette vaping was considered social acceptable by
many, as opposed to cigarette smoking [72]. However, the lower level of sensation and satisfac-
tion experienced with e-cigarettes, compared to cigarettes, may explain why some individuals
who initiate with e-cigarettes then transition to cigarettes even thought this transition is associ-
ated with higher nicotine ingestion [73–75].
E-cigarette use among former cigarette smokers may confer health risks. For example, e-
cigarette aerosols carry high levels of aldehydes (e.g., formaldehyde) that affect cardiovascular
function and high levels of fine particles that accelerate heart disease [76,77]. E-cigarette users
experience equivalent reductions in vascular function (e.g., vitamin E levels and flow-media-
tion dilatation) as cigarette smokers. Furthermore, e-cigarette use suppresses immune and
inflammatory-response genes in nasal epithelial cells and injures lung epithelial cells [78,79].
Our study has some potential limitations. First, we do not know if e-cigarette use causes cig-
arette-smoking initiation in adolescents and young adults. Published cohort studies have
found consistent evidence of an increased risk of cigarette smoking initiation among non-
smoking youth who had ever used e-cigarettes after accounting for known demographic, psy-
chosocial, and behavioral risk factors [13–18,20,21]. We varied this longitudinal association
between e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking initiation and reach similar conclusions. Per-
haps more concerning that cigarette smoking initiation, e-cigarette use was independently
associated with progression to heaving patterns of cigarette smoking among US adolescents
[80]. Second, we do not know the type of e-cigarette currently used by cigarette-smoking
adults. Second generation e-cigarettes (e.g., tank-style systems) deliver nicotine more effi-
ciently than the first generation e-cigarettes used in Bullen et al. trial [49,81]. Third generation
e-cigarettes (e.g., advanced personal vaporizers) deliver nicotine at approximately the same
level and speed as traditional cigarettes [82]. However, we do not yet know the national

 prevalence of second and third generation e-cigarette use among current cigarette smokers
who are trying to quit, and no published trials or cohort studies estimate cessation efficacy or
effectiveness of third-generation e-cigarettes.
Third, in our calculation of benefit, we did not consider the possibility that e-cigarette use
among current cigarette smokers leads to a reduction in the intensity of cigarettes smoked per
day. A trial conducted by Caponnetto et al. found e-cigarette reduced the median number of
cigarettes smoked per day among 300 Italian smokers not intending to quit [83]. Yet, similar
reductions in the number of cigarettes smoked per day has not been observed in the US
between dual users of e-cigarettes and cigarettes and exclusive cigarette smokers [65].
Fourth, we did not consider the potential population-level health benefit or harm of e-ciga-
rette use among former cigarette smokers because no published trials or cohort studies
assessed whether e-cigarette use among former cigarette smokers led to higher or lower rates
of relapse to cigarette smoking. A recent cross-sectional study suggested long-term former cig-
arette smokers who use e-cigarettes may not experience any higher rate of relapse to smoking
than their counterparts who do not use e-cigarettes [84].
Current public health models may yield substantively different conclusions about the net
harm or benefit of e-cigarette use because there is insufficient data on the effect of e-cigarette use
on cigarette smoking-related transitions and tobacco-related diseases. Conclusions may also differ
because of decisions—both implicit and explicit—about the framework and underlying assump-
tions inherent in the model. The host of decisions required to develop a model produce structural
uncertainty that may exceed parameter uncertainty [85,86]. Sensitivity analysis will not capture
structural uncertainty because the model, itself, remains constant. Future work could incorporate
Bayesian model averaging to account structural, or model-based, uncertainty [87]. Future work
could also grade the quality of models based on published best practices [86,88].
In conclusion, based on currently available evidence on the e-cigarette associated transition
probabilities of cigarette smoking cessation and initiation, our study suggests that e-cigarettes
pose more harm than they confer benefit at the population level. If e-cigarettes are to confer a
net population-level benefit in the future, the effectiveness of e-cigarettes as a smoking cessa-
tion tool will need to be much higher than it currently is. The US Preventive Services Task
Force concludes the existing scientific evidence is insufficient to clinically recommend e-ciga-
rettes as a smoking cessation tool [89]. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute of Clini-
cal Excellence also notes limited evidence on the long-term health effects of e-cigarette use and
does not clinically recommend e-cigarettes for smoking cessation, in contrast to Public Health
England and the Royal College of Physicians [35,90,91]. Additionally, comprehensive tobacco
control efforts are needed to reduce the appeal of e-cigarettes to youth.
