Abstract
Introduction—Relatively little has been reported characterizing cumulative risk associated with 
co-occurring risk factors for cigarette smoking. The purpose of the present study was to address 
that knowledge gap in a U.S. nationally representative sample.
Methods—Data were obtained from 114,426 adults (≥ 18 years) in the U.S. National Survey on 
Drug Use and Health (years 2011–13). Multiple logistic regression and classification and 
regression tree (CART) modeling were used to examine risk of current smoking associated with 
eight co-occurring risk factors (age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational attainment, poverty, drug 
abuse/dependence, alcohol abuse/dependence, mental illness).
Results—Each of these eight risk factors was independently associated with significant increases 
in the odds of smoking when concurrently present in a multiple logistic regression model. Effects 
of risk-factor combinations were typically summative. Exceptions to that pattern were in the 
direction of less-than-summative effects when one of the combined risk factors was associated 
with generally high or low rates of smoking (e.g., drug abuse/dependence, age ≥65). CART 
modeling identified subpopulation risk profiles wherein smoking prevalence varied from a low of 
11% to a high of 74% depending on particular risk factor combinations. Being a college graduate 
was the strongest independent predictor of smoking status, classifying 30% of the adult 
population.
Conclusions—These results offer strong evidence that the effects associated with common risk 
factors for cigarette smoking are independent, cumulative, and generally summative. The results 
also offer potentially useful insights into national population risk profiles around which U.S. 
tobacco policies can be developed or refined.

1. Introduction
There have been substantial decreases in U.S. national smoking prevalence since the mid 
21960’s, but unfortunately these decreases have been unevenly distributed in the general 
population (Schroeder and Koh, 2014). Substantial reductions have been noted in some sub-
populations (e.g., more affluent non-Hispanic Whites), but relatively little change has 
occurred in others (e.g., those with substance use disorders), and increases in still others 
(e.g., economically disadvantaged women) (Chilcoat, 2009; Fiore et al., 2008; Schroeder 
and Koh, 2014). These uneven changes in smoking prevalence underpin considerable current 
interest in understanding individual differences in risk for cigarette smoking and other forms 
of tobacco and nicotine use.
Monitoring the extent to which prevalence of smoking or use of other tobacco products 
differs by risk factors is now recognized to be an important element of tobacco control 
(Fiore et al., 2008) and regulatory science (Ashley et al., 2014). The overarching purpose of 
the present study is to begin characterizing the effects of co-occurring risk factors for 
cigarette smoking. We focus on cigarette smoking because it remains the most prevalent, 
toxic, and costly form of tobacco and nicotine use (U.S. DHHS, 2014). We know of no 
exhaustive set of risk factors for cigarette smoking, although gender, age, race/ethnicity, 
educational attainment, poverty status, substance use disorders, and mental illness are each 
well documented in the literature and are examined in the present study (Fiore et al., 2008; 
Higgins et al., 2015; Higgins and Chilcoat, 2009; Schroeder and Koh, 2014). While each of 
these risk factors inevitably co-occurs with some arrangement of the others (i.e., gender 
always co-occurs with chronological age, educational attainment, and race/ethnicity), there 
has been relatively little research reported explicitly characterizing the combined effects of 
co-occurring risk factors for cigarette smoking. Knowing whether effects of co-occurring 
risk factors are independent of each other (i.e., summative), or whether some may offset 
risks associated with others (i.e., less-than-summative/antagonistic), or perhaps increase risk 
in a multiplicative (i.e., synergistic) manner is important to the development of evidence-
based tobacco policy and is the overarching purpose of the present study. Also of interest is 
empirically examining the relative strength of these common risk factors and how 
cumulative risk varies across particular risk factor profiles.
In a prior literature review on gender differences in prevalence of cigarette smoking and use 
of other nicotine and delivery products in the U.S., gender differences in risk were noted to 
generally act independently of the influence of other co-occurring risk factors, that is, gender 
and the other risk factors appeared to act in a cumulative and summative manner (Higgins et 
al., 2015). However, these were qualitative observations regarding patterns in previously 
published articles, none of which was explicitly designed to characterize the combined 
effects of co-occurring risk factors.

 The present study was designed to build upon the initial findings described above by 
examining (a) a broader range of co-occurring risk factors than those involving gender, (b) 
statistically examining the independent and combined effects of common risk factors for 
smoking, and (c) identifying particularly low- and high-risk profiles. We know of no prior 
studies specifically on this topic regarding risk for current cigarette smoking, although 
studies characterizing effects of co-occurring risk factors are common in other areas of 
health research (e.g., Park et al., 2009; Schnohr et al., 2002). The present study was 
conducted using what at the time of study initiation was the most recent three years (2011–
2013) of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) (SAMHSA, 2012, 2013, 
2014), a cross-sectional survey that has been used effectively in prior studies examining 
prevalence of cigarette smoking across various socio-demographic and psychiatric risk 
factors (e.g., Gfroerer et al., 2013; Redner et al., 2014a,b; White et al., 2015).
2. Methods
2.1. Data source
The NSDUH is a nationally representative survey of the U.S. non-institutionalized 
population aged ≥12 years that measures prevalence and correlates of drug use (Center for 
Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, 2014). Detailed descriptions of survey procedures 
have been provided for each of the survey years (SAMHSA, 2012, 2013, 2014). Only 
individuals aged ≥ 18 years were included in the present study so that all participants were 
of legal age to purchase cigarettes. Across each of the survey years, NSDUH recruitment 
was completed using a multistage area probability sample design in which a predetermined 
number of participants were randomly recruited by address within each state. Respondents 
completed computer- and audio-assisted structured interviews. Respondents were selected 
from the civilian non-institutionalized population, including group homes, shelters, and 
college dormitories. Individuals on active military duty, in residential drug treatment 
programs, in jail, or homeless without residence were excluded. The present study included 
114,426 adult respondents interviewed during 2011 (N = 39,133), 2012 (N = 37,869), and 
2013 (N = 37,424). Annual weighted response rates were 74.4%, 73.0%, and 71.7% for the 
2011, 2012, and 2013 surveys, respectively. Data were weighted during analysis to adjust for 
the differential probability of both selection and response.
Current smoker status was defined as smoking all or part of a cigarette within the 30 days 
preceding the interview and ≥100 cigarettes lifetime. The six racial/ethnic categories used in 
the survey were mutually exclusive. Persons identified as Hispanic might be of any race 
while persons identified as White, Black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, or Other 
were all non-Hispanic. The category “Other” included Native Hawaiians or Other Pacific 
Islanders and individuals endorsing two or more races. Poverty status (living below or at/
above the federal poverty line) was defined using poverty thresholds published by the U.S. 
Census Bureau. Any mental illness was defined as having a mental, behavioral, or emotional 
disorder in the past 12 months, excluding developmental or substance use disorders. To 
assess the presence of any mental illness, respondents aged ≥18 years answered a series of 
14 questions that made up two scales measuring psychological distress (Kessler-6) and 
disability (World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule). Scores on these two

 scales were used to determine any mental illness status based on a statistical model 
developed from clinical interviews that assessed disorders based on criteria in the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Past year alcohol and illicit drug 
abuse/dependence diagnoses were also based on DSM-IV criteria.
2.2. Statistical methods
Sample-adjusted frequencies and confidence intervals (CIs) were generated across all 
respondents ≥18 years of age. Variables of interest were determined based on previously 
identified demographic and socioeconomic predictors of smoking, including age, sex, 
education, race/ethnicity, poverty status, past year mental illness, alcohol abuse/dependence, 
and illicit drug abuse/dependence.
Associations of risk factors with current smoking status were examined in separate analyses. 
For each risk factor, weighted, univariate logistic regression was used to determine which 
variables would be included in subsequent multivariable models and to conduct an initial 
comparison of odds ratios (with CIs) across variable levels predicting current smoker status. 
PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC in SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to conduct the 
analyses, relying on maximum likelihood estimation and the Fisher scoring algorithm. 
Variances were estimated using Taylor series linearization.
Multivariable logistic regression analyses predicting current smoker status were conducted 
using all variables from univariate logistic regression analyses that significantly predicted 
smoking status, initially without including any interaction terms. Again, odds ratios (with 
CIs) were generated. Analyses were repeated examining all possible two-way interactions 
across the eight risk factors (maximum of 28 risk-factor combinations each across analyses 
predicting smoking status). Interactions were first tested individually. Interactions that 
contributed significantly to predicting current smoker status were added to the multivariable 
model. Interactions that remained significant predictors were retained in the final regression 
model. These analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Across all tests, statistical significance was defined as p < .001 (2-tailed) to correct for 
multiple comparisons corresponding to investigating interactions.
Interaction results from the final regression model were used to initially characterize the 
combined effects of the risk factors. Where an interaction term was non-significant between 
two risk factors that each produced significant main effects, combined effects were 
categorized as summative (i.e., sum of the independent effects of the respective risk factors). 
Where significant interactions were noted between predictors, they were categorized as 
representing a deviation from summation. Further determination of whether an interaction 
represented a less-than- or greater-than-summative effect was determined by reviewing 
graphic displays of the relevant odds ratios (see Fig. 2).
Lastly, a classification and regression tree (CART) analysis (Breiman et al., 1984) was 
conducted to supplement multiple logistic regression modeling, using the same eight 
independent variables to predict current smoking. CART analysis is a nonparametric 
procedure for dividing a population of interest into mutually exclusive subgroups based on a 
dependent variable of interest such as current smoking status in the present study (Lemon et 
Higgins et al.

 al., 2003) and, in the process, identifying independent variables with the most explanatory 
power in accounting for that dependent variable. The process begins by identifying the 
single most important independent variable for dividing the total sample (parent node) into 
two groups (child nodes), using a predetermined branching criterion. Nodes are split based 
on their purity using the Gini impurity function (Breiman et al., 1984). A “pure” node has no 
variability in the dependent variable. A completely “impure” node has a conditional 
probability of p(k|t) = 0.5, where k refers to the dependent variable and t refers to the node 
(Lei et al., 2015). A splitting or branching criterion “selects the split that has the largest 
difference between the impurity of the parent node and a weighted average of the impurity 
of the two child nodes” (Lemon et al., 2003, p. 174). Given the dependent variable was 
binary, we used the Gini impurity function to split nodes, repeating the process recursively 
with every subsample, until the subsample reached a minimum size or no further splits could 
be made. The tree was built using R’s rpart package (R Core Team, 2013; Therneau et al., 
2013). We used the classification method in R, given the dependent variable was binary, and 
included survey weights, given the multi-stage sampling procedures of the NSDUH. A fully 
saturated tree was produced initially, and then pruned by selecting the complexity parameter 
that minimized cross-validation error and setting a minimum sample size in terminal nodes 
of n = 1000.
3. Results
3.1. Logistic regression analyses
Overall prevalence of current smokers in this adult sample was 21.6% (Table 1, left-most 
column). Each of the eight risk factors significantly increased the odds of being a current 
smoker in univariate logistic regression (Table 1, center-most columns). Each of those risk 
factors also remained significant in a multivariate logistic regression model adjusting for the 
influence of the others, demonstrating significant independent associations with smoking 
status (Table 1, right-most columns). The largest increase in the adjusted odds of smoking 
was seen with educational attainment, followed by age, past year illicit drug abuse/
dependence, race/ethnicity, past year alcohol abuse/dependence, income below federal 
poverty level, mental illness, and gender.
Results from including the two-way interaction term in the final multivariate logistic 
regression model were used for an initial characterization of combined effects of these eight 
significant risk factors (Table 2). Across all of the possible two-way interactions, 20 of 28 
(71%) were not significant, meaning that the combined effects of these risk factors were 
summative (i.e., they did not deviate significantly from a summation of the effects of the two 
risk factors when considered alone) (Fig. 1).
The eight (29%) significant interactions involved each of the eight risk factors, but mostly 
race/ethnicity which has 6 levels in the present study and was involved in five of the eight 
significant interactions (Table 2). Age was involved in three interactions and the six other 
risk factors were each involved in one interaction (Table 2).
As is illustrated in Fig. 2, these interactions largely involved less-than-summative effects 
where one of the two risk factors was associated with generally high or low smoking

 prevalence. As shown in Panel A, for example, the typical pattern of Blacks having lower 
odds than Whites for being a current smoker was present in the 18–25 years but not the ≥65 
years age bracket where smoking rates are generally low. Similarly, as shown in Panel B, the 
typical pattern of Hispanics having lower smoking rates than Whites was discernible among 
those with less than a high school education but not among college graduates where smoking 
rates are generally low. In Panel C we see a similar example where the effects associated 
with having less than a high education are discernible among those in the 18–25 years but 
not the ≥65 years age bracket where smoking rates are generally low. As a final example, in 
Panel D we see increases in the odds of smoking associated with alcohol abuse/dependence 
among those without but not those with illicit drug abuse/dependence where smoking rates 
are generally high. We saw no evidence of interactions related to multiplicative effects of 
combining risk factors.
Use of logistic regression to characterize more than two-way interactions when dealing with 
8 risk factors becomes impractical in terms of interpretation, and thus we used the CART 
analysis for that task and also for comparing the relative strength of the eight risk factors. 
Regression trees are adept at illustrating important risk factor combinations or profiles 
(Austin, 2007).
3.2. Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses
The CART analysis identified educational attainment as the strongest risk factor followed by 
age, race/ethnicity, drug abuse/dependence, alcohol abuse/dependence, poverty level, mental 
illness, and gender. Fig. 3 shows a pruned classification tree modeling changes in smoking 
prevalence associated with the various risk-factor combinations. The graphic is designed to 
represent an inverted tree.
The rectangle shown at the top of Fig. 3 is referred to as the root node. It represents 100% of 
the U.S. adult non-institutionalized population as indicated in the bottom row of information 
displayed in the node, with 78% non-smokers and 22% smokers as indicated in top row of 
information displayed in the node. The 1st split of the entire population was based on 
whether someone was or was not a college graduate (dashed lines immediately below root 
node). College graduates branched leftward and downward to a terminal node (no further 
splitting/classification possible) with a smoking prevalence of only 11%, one half that is 
seen in the overall population. Note that terminal nodes also display a 3rd piece of 
information not shown in the root or child nodes, which is the percentage of the current 
smoking population that is represented by that node (bottom-most row). This terminal node 
representing college graduates includes prevalence rates of 11% current smokers and 89% 
non-smokers, and represents 30% of the U.S. adult non-institutionalized population and 15% 
of adult current smokers within that population. The 70% of the overall population (smokers 
& non-smokers) that had less than a college education branched rightward and downward to 
a child node (further splitting/classification possible) where prevalence of current smoking 
increased to 26% corresponding to removal of the relatively low-risk college graduates from 
the sample.
The 2nd branching was based on chronological age, dividing all those in the adult U.S. non-
institutionalized population with less than a college education by whether they were ≥65 vs.

 18–64 years of age. Those ≥65 years branched leftward and downward to a terminal node. 
Note that smoking prevalence in those ≥65 years is lowest among all age brackets. As such, 
the 11% smoking prevalence in this node was equal to that seen among college graduates 
despite this subgroup having lower educational attainment. Those whose age was below 65 
years that branched rightward and downward to a child node where smoking prevalence 
rates increased further to 30% corresponding to having removed those in the oldest age 
bracket.
The next branching of this subgroup with less than a college education and ages between 18 
and 64 years was based on the absence vs. presence of past year drug abuse/dependence. 
Those without drug abuse/dependence branched leftward and downward to a child node 
where smoking prevalence decreased to 28% corresponding to having removed the relatively 
small subgroup with drug abuse/dependence. The subgroup with past year drug abuse/
dependence moved rightward and downward to a child node where smoking prevalence 
increased to 67%, more than three-fold above the overall 22% smoking prevalence rate seen 
in the entire adult population. Further branching of this subgroup was based on additional 
age levels followed by race/ethnicity levels resulting in three separate terminal nodes. Note 
that all individuals represented in those three terminal nodes had less than a college 
education and past year drug abuse/dependence, but smoking prevalence nevertheless varied 
between 46% and 74% depending on the particular age and race/ethnicity levels with which 
those risk factors were combined. Those terminal nodes each represented 1% or less of the 
entire population and thus a relatively small (1–3%) overall proportion of current smokers.
This same general branching process was repeated until the entire study population was 
classified in risk profiles across the 13 terminal nodes in the bottom row. The four left-most 
nodes represent ~90% of the U.S. adult non-institutionalized population and the 9 right-most 
nodes ~10%. Note that the majority of all current smokers (74%) are represented in the four 
left-most nodes even though smoking prevalence rates are much lower in those nodes. An 
alternative way of characterizing this distribution is that smoking is strikingly 
overrepresented in the 9 rightmost terminal nodes such that 26% of all current smokers are 
represented among only 10% of the total population.
Balancing smoking prevalence against proportion of the population represented, the terminal 
node or risk profile that represents the largest proportion of all current smokers is the fourth 
from left that comprises individuals with high school or some college education, ages 18–64 
years, all race/ethnicity levels except Asian & Hispanic, and no past year alcohol or drug 
abuse/dependence. That node represents 34% of the entire population and 43% of all adult 
current smokers.
4. Discussion
The present study was conducted to follow up on observations reported as part of a literature 
review on gender differences where risk for cigarette smoking appeared to change in a 
cumulative and summative manner when gender was considered in combination with other 
co-occurring risk factors (Higgins et al., 2015). The present results confirm those earlier 
observations and extend them to additional risk-factor combinations beyond gender. Results

 from the multiple logistic regression analyses provide clear evidence that each of the eight 
risk factors examined act as independent predictors. Results from testing all possible two-
way interactions among those eight independent predictors indicated that they usually did 
not interact significantly (i.e., 20 of 28 tests were non-significant). That is, these risk factors 
generally acted in a cumulative and summative manner where effects of the risk factors in 
combination did not change significantly from those observed when each was examined as 
single predictors in the adjusted model. In those instances where there were significant 
interactions, the general pattern was that one of the combined risk factors was associated 
with diminished effects compared to when examined alone (less-than-summative effects) 
(Fig. 2). The CART analysis provided numerous opportunities to observe orderly upward 
and downward changes in smoking prevalence across population subgroups corresponding 
to changes in risk-factor combinations. Considered together, these results provide an 
empirical framework for understanding the striking differences in smoking prevalence 
observed across population subgroups and for making predictions about the likely effects of 
novel risk-factor combinations.
Three more specific points about the risk profiles from the CART analysis merit comment. 
First, there was only one instance where a single risk factor – actually a single risk-factor 
level – acted as a stand-alone risk profile. That was being a college graduate. Moreover, this 
single risk-factor level classified 30% of the U.S. adult population demonstrating 
considerable reach. Educational attainment was also associated with the largest changes in 
the odds of smoking in the multiple logistic regression. These results underscoring the 
importance of a college education as a protective factor and identifying educational 
attainment more generally as the strongest risk factor among the eight examined are 
consistent with the emphasis that has been previously placed on educational attainment in 
discussing prevention of smoking among youth and young adults (e.g., see Chapter 2, U.S., 
HDHS, 2012) as well as addressing smoking risk among women and other vulnerable 
populations (Chilcoat, 2009; Graham et al., 2007; Higgins et al., 2009; Hiscock et al., 2012; 
Kandel et al., 2009). Also important to underscore is that educational attainment is a 
modifiable risk factor. Considering the pervasive and robust associations between 
educational attainment and smoking risk, there are grounds for a broader approach to 
tobacco control policy that encompasses more distal risk factors like general educational 
attainment in addition to the more proximal and conventional tobacco-control foci (Graham 
et al., 2007; Higgins et al., 2009; Kandel et al., 2009).
Second, the risk profile corresponding to the 4th terminal node in Fig. 3 (counting from left 
to right) warrants further comment. That risk profile represents adults with a high school or 
some college education level, chronological age in the 18–64 years bracket, Black, White, 
American Indian/Native Alaskan, or Other race ethnicity, and no past year alcohol or drug 
abuse/dependence. By a factor of 2.9- to 43-fold, the profile included more current smokers 
(43%) than any of the 12 other risk profiles identified in the CART analysis. This profile 
represents a large segment of the U.S. adult population who educationally fall into the 
unskilled and skilled labor socioeconomic class and who for reasons that are not well 
understood have been relatively less responsive to efforts to reduce smoking (e.g., Asfar et 
al., 2015). Prior reports underscoring the relatively high smoking rates in blue-collar and 
service occupations have directed attention to the workplace setting as an important potential

 focal point for tobacco control and regulatory efforts that would have the potential to reach 
many within this subgroup (CDC, 2011). However, additional and complementary 
campaigns specifically targeting this risk-profile subgroup through other channels and 
contexts (social media, health care providers, community/civic organizations) are likely to 
be needed as well. This is a risk profile subgroup with which tobacco reduction efforts will 
need to improve considerably if the smoking-related goals of Healthy People 2020 are to be 
realized (Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2015).
Third, the subgroups represented across the nine rightmost terminal nodes in the bottom row 
of Fig. 3 merit further comment as well. Smoking prevalence rates ranged from 37% to 74% 
across those terminal nodes corresponding to a relatively larger number of risk factors and 
higher risk-factor levels than in the other nodes. Collectively, those nine nodes accounted for 
only 10% of the population but 26% of all current smokers. While not explicitly examined in 
this study, smokers with these profiles are more likely to be nicotine dependent and are at 
increased risk for adverse health impacts of smoking (Higgins and Chilcoat, 2009; Hiscock 
et al., 2012). The lower educational attainment levels and higher rates of alcohol and drug 
use disorders represented in those nodes also make it likely that other medical co-
morbidities will be present further increasing vulnerability to the adverse health impacts of 
smoking (Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010; Gaalema et al., 2015; Hser et al., 2001; Niaura et 
al., 2012; Rowa-Dewar et al., 2015; Schroeder, 2007). These are patterns that contribute 
directly to the unsettling problem of health disparities (Higgins, 2014; Schroeder, 2007). If 
considered only in terms of absolute numbers of smokers, those nine nodes may appear to 
warrant less attention or resources. However, when considered in terms of the overall 
potential morbidity, mortality, and healthcare cost impacts involved, those nodes represent 
risk profiles where more effective strategies for reducing smoking are sorely needed. For 
potential behavioral economic and pharmacological strategies for doing interested readers 
may want to see reports by Davis et al. (under review) and Tidey (under review).
There are several limitations of the present study that should be acknowledged. First, the 
observational research design used in the present study cannot support causal inferences. 
Second, the NSDUH excludes several groups with relatively high smoking prevalence rates 
including individuals in the active military, jail, or homeless, which may limit 
generalizability of the results to those subgroups. Moreover, we excluded adolescents 
thereby potentially limiting generalizability to that important subgroup. Third, the NSDUH 
is a cross-sectional survey and thus does not permit examination of associations within 
individuals over time. Extending this research on co-occurring risk factors to a longitudinal 
survey such as the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH, 2016) will be an 
important future research direction to assess whether cumulative risk is generally summative 
when examined prospectively over time. Fourth, the present study did not include tobacco 
products other than cigarettes, which will be an important gap to address in future research. 
Those limitations notwithstanding, we believe that the present study provides important new 
knowledge regarding effects associated with co-occurring risk factors for current cigarette 
smoking that has the potential to inform and advance evidence-based tobacco control and 
regulatory policy efforts.

A pruned, weighted classification and regression tree (CART) model of associations 
between current (past 30 days) smoking status and the following eight risk factors in the 
U.S. adult (≥18 years of age) population: educational attainment, age, race/ethnicity, past 
year drug abuse/dependence, past year alcohol abuse/dependence, annual income below 
federal poverty level, and past year mental illness. Results from a saturated model were 
“pruned” using CART analytic software to reduce complexity (R Core Team, 2013). 
Rectangles (nodes) represent smoking prevalence rates for the entire population (top-most 
node) or population subgroups (all others nodes). Nodes also list the proportion of the adult 
population represented. Using the root node as an example, 78% of the population are non-
smokers, 22% smokers, and this node represents 100 of the U.S. non-institutionalized adult 
population. Lines below nodes represent the binary “yes”–”no” branching around particular 
risk factors and risk-factor levels, with subgroups in whom the risk factor/level is present 
moving leftward and downward and those in whom it is absent moving rightward and 
downward for further potential partitioning based on additional risk factors/levels. The 
bottom row comprises terminal nodes (i.e., final partitioning for a particular subgroup). Note 
that minimal terminal node size was set to ≥1000 individuals. Terminal nodes contain the 
same information as the other nodes plus the percent of all adult current smokers represented 
by that node. Percent of current smokers represented is calculated by the following equation: 
% total population represented by a node × smoking prevalence in that node/smoking 
prevalence in the entire study sample × 100. Tallying % current smokers represented across
