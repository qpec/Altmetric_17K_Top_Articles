Abstract
BACKGROUND—The incidence of sudden cardiac arrest during participation in sports activities 
remains unknown. Preparticipation screening programs aimed at preventing sudden cardiac arrest 
during sports activities are thought to be able to identify at-risk athletes; however, the efficacy of 
these programs remains controversial. We sought to identify all sudden cardiac arrests that 
occurred during participation in sports activities within a specific region of Canada and to 
determine their causes.
METHODS—In this retrospective study, we used the Rescu Epistry cardiac arrest database 
(which contains records of every cardiac arrest attended by paramedics in the network region) to 
identify all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred from 2009 through 2014 in persons 12 to 
45 years of age during participation in a sport. Cases were adjudicated as sudden cardiac arrest 
(i.e., having a cardiac cause) or as an event resulting from a noncardiac cause, on the basis of 
records from multiple sources, including ambulance call reports, autopsy reports, in-hospital data, 
and records of direct interviews with patients or family members.
RESULTS—Over the course of 18.5 million person-years of observation, 74 sudden cardiac 
arrests occurred during participation in a sport; of these, 16 occurred during competitive sports and 
58 occurred during noncompetitive sports. The incidence of sudden cardiac arrest during 
competitive sports was 0.76 cases per 100,000 athlete-years, with 43.8% of the athletes surviving 
until they were discharged from the hospital. Among the competitive athletes, two deaths were 
attributed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and none to arrhythmogenic right ventricular 
cardiomyopathy. Three cases of sudden cardiac arrest that occurred during participation in

 competitive sports were determined to have been potentially identifiable if the athletes had 
undergone preparticipation screening.
CONCLUSIONS—In our study involving persons who had out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, the 
incidence of sudden cardiac arrest during participation in competitive sports was 0.76 cases per 
100,000 athlete-years. The occurrence of sudden cardiac arrest due to structural heart disease was 
uncommon during participation in competitive sports. (Funded by the National Heart, Lung, and 
Blood Institute and others.)
The occurrence of sudden cardiac arrest in young persons during participation in competitive 
sports is a rare but tragic event. In numerous jurisdictions, preparticipation screening 
systems have been implemented on the assumption that most cases of sudden cardiac arrest 
that occur during sports activities can be predicted and prevented by identifying persons at 
risk, withdrawing them from competitive sports, and in selected cases, applying therapeutic 
preventive measures.1,2
The reported incidence of sudden cardiac death in the young (usually defined as <35 years 
of age) — with sudden cardiac death referring exclusively to sudden cardiac arrest that 
results in death — ranges widely, from 1.0 to 6.4 cases per 100,000 patient-years.3 The 
instantaneous risk of sudden cardiac arrest in persons who have a predisposition to sudden 
cardiac arrest is markedly increased during participation in sports, even though most sudden 
cardiac arrests occur while the person is at rest.4 The incidence of sudden cardiac death 
during participation in a sport in the general population has been reported to be 
approximately 0.46 cases per 100,000 person-years.5
The uncertainty regarding the precise incidence of sudden cardiac arrest in the young, 
particularly during participation in a sport, can be attributed in part to imperfect data 
collection systems that have been used in previous studies. Almost all the studies have 
focused on persons who could not be resuscitated (sudden cardiac deaths), and in most of 
the studies, death certificates, hospital records, autopsy reports, or searches of publicly 
available records were used to identify cases of sudden cardiac arrest.3–10 These approaches 
are limited because systematic methods were not used to identify all persons in a particular 
community who had sudden cardiac arrest and because survivors were not included.
Rescu Epistry is a prospective, comprehensive registry of all persons who had out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest and whose event was attended by emergency medical services (EMS) 
personnel in a defined region of the province of Ontario, Canada. This validated registry 
allows an opportunity to systematically examine the circumstances and causes of out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest to quantify how many of the events are truly sudden and how many 
are truly cardiac in origin.11 We used this registry to ascertain the incidence of sudden 
cardiac arrest during participation in competitive and noncompetitive sports activities among 
young persons and to determine the underlying causes. Currently, no widespread systematic 
programs to screen persons before participation in a sport are in place in Canada12; the 
current analysis allowed us to estimate the potential efficacy of systematic pre-participation 
screening.

 METHODS
STUDY DESIGN
In this retrospective study, we identified out-of-hospital cardiac arrests using the population-
based Rescu Epistry cardiac arrest database, which is based on data definitions from the 
Cardiac Arrest Registry of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium13 database and the 
Strategies for Post Arrest Resuscitation Care Network11 database. In brief, the Rescu Epistry 
database is a prospective, population-based registry of consecutive out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrests attended by EMS personnel who were responding to 911 calls in a specific area of 
Ontario, including both urban and rural regions, that has a combined population of 6.6 
million (see Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org). Data are collected from a network of seven land-based EMS agencies, 
local fire departments, the provincial air ambulance service, and 44 participating destination 
hospitals. Trained personnel enter epidemiologic data from standardized pre-hospital call 
reports and in-hospital records into secured databases. Potential out-of-hospital cardiac 
arrests that are missed by Rescu Epistry are assumed to be expected deaths for which an 
advance directive is in place or for which the treating physician arranges for body removal 
services without involving EMS. Such deaths must meet legislated criteria that define 
obvious death.
The St. Michael’s Hospital research ethics board provided ethics approval for the study. The 
study was supported by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the Canadian 
Institutes of Health Research, and others. None of the organizations that funded the study 
had any role in the design or conduct of the study; in the collection, management, analysis, 
or interpretation of the data; or in the preparation, review, or approval of the manuscript for 
submission. All the authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and the 
analyses.
KEY DEFINITIONS
We defined out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as an event that did not occur in a hospital, was 
attended by EMS personnel, may or may not have been witnessed, was associated with an 
abrupt loss of vital signs, and resulted either in death or in successful resuscitation.14 We 
defined sudden cardiac arrest as an unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that occurred 
abruptly in a seemingly healthy person, may or may not have been witnessed, and was 
attributed to a cardiac cause after adjudication (as described in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Our definition of sudden cardiac arrest included persons who did not survive 
(defined previously as sudden cardiac death) as well as persons who were successfully 
resuscitated.
We defined a competitive sport as any organized or sanctioned sporting event that had been 
certified by an official, recognized sports association; persons who participated in a 
competitive sport could have been either professional or amateur athletes. We defined a 
noncompetitive sport as any form of a sport or recreational physical activity that was not 
formally organized or sanctioned. Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest was considered to be 
associated with a sport if the person was estimated to have exerted more than 3 metabolic

 equivalents (METs) during the activity in question and if the cardiac arrest occurred either 
during the activity or within 1 hour after the activity, during either competition or 
training.15,16
STUDY POPULATION
All cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac cause (according to the 
standardized Utstein criteria17–19), as well as cases that could have been the result of a 
sudden cardiac arrest event (e.g., drownings), that occurred among persons 12 to 45 years of 
age, that were attended by paramedics, that were treated or untreated (according to criteria 
specified by the medical directives of the EMS that define the presence or absence of signs 
of obvious death), and that resulted in death or in resuscitation were identified from the 
Rescu Epistry database from the beginning of 2009 to the end of 2014. The lower age limit 
for the study was chosen to include athletes who were potentially eligible for screening. The 
upper age limit was chosen to maximize the inclusion of persons who had heritable cardiac 
syndromes and to reduce overlap with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to atherosclerotic 
coronary artery disease.
The estimated total number of competitive athletes in the region served by the participating 
EMS agencies (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) who were 12 to 45 years of age was 
calculated on the basis of the total number of competitive athletes who had registered with a 
sporting organization in Ontario during 2012 (information was obtained through direct 
correspondence with the Ontario Ministry of Tourism, Culture, and Sport) and was prorated 
according to the age-matched population in the geographic area covered by the study with 
the use of the 2011 Canadian Census. Athletes who were registered in racing events were 
recorded separately from those who participated in other sports, according to region and age 
group.20 It was assumed that the number of athletes did not vary significantly from year to 
year within the study period.21
CASE IDENTIFICATION
Cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that were related to competitive or noncompetitive 
sports were defined as cases that occurred during, or within 1 hour after, exertion of more 
than 3 METs during the activity. We identified such cases by manually sorting through all 
ambulance call reports and records from the emergency department or hospital for reports of 
persons who had a cardiac arrest at a recreational facility, university or college, sports field, 
stadium or arena, athletic facility, golf course, water area, hotel, condominium or apartment, 
park, or street.
Cases were cross-referenced by comparison with additional data sources to obtain a clinical 
and pathological assessment that was as complete as possible. The data sources that were 
used included ambulance call reports, fire call reports, in-hospital data (abstracted from 
emergency department reports, in-hospital medical notes, discharge summaries, 
consultations, clinical tests, and medical certificates of death), medical records from family 
physicians, coroner investigative statements, autopsy reports, toxicology reports, and records 
of direct interviews with patients or family members. All out-of-hospital cardiac arrests were

 classified as either sudden cardiac arrest or cardiac arrest from other causes, as defined 
above and described previously.22
AUTOPSY AND MOLECULAR AUTOPSY
Autopsies were performed at the Provincial Forensic Pathology Unit of Ontario, which 
conducts approximately 6000 autopsies annually (Statistics Canada 2014, 
www.mcscs.jus.gov.on.ca/english/DeathInvestigations/Pathology/pathology_main.html), and 
were conducted either by forensic pathologists or by cardiovascular pathologists according 
to a standardized protocol in which all organs are examined both macroscopically and 
microscopically.4 Criteria for identifying specific cardiac pathologies have been described 
previously23; additional details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. Molecular 
autopsies, if performed, were done by analysis (GeneDx, Familion, or CTGT Connective 
Tissue Gene Tests) of DNA samples obtained from whole blood at the time of the autopsy.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Descriptive statistics were used to assess the distribution of variables; continuous variables 
were summarized as mean values with standard deviations, and categorical variables were 
summarized as counts and percentages. Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were 
calculated in the total population of competitive athletes over a 6-year period. All 
calculations and analyses were performed with the use of SPSS software, version 23.0 
(IBM).
RESULTS
STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND DETAILS OF CARDIAC ARRESTS
The population of persons 12 to 45 years of age in the region served by the participating 
EMS agencies (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix) was estimated to be 3,085,240 in 
2011. The estimated total follow-up time was 18.5 million person-years between the 
beginning of 2009 and the end of 2014. There were an estimated 352,499 registered 
competitive athletes in the study region in 2012 (which represented 11.4% of the population 
in the study region), resulting in an estimated total follow-up time of 2.1 million athlete-
years. A total of 3825 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests among persons 12 to 45 years of age 
occurred during the study period, of which 2144 occurred in a public place. We reviewed the 
ambulance call reports for all 2144 cases, as well as the associated in-hospital records, 
coroner’s records, and records of direct interviews with patients or family members, as 
appropriate. Of the cardiac arrests that occurred in a public place, 74 were determined to be 
sudden cardiac arrests that occurred during competitive sports (16 cases) or noncompetitive 
sports (58 cases) (Fig. 1).
Details of prehospital events and causes and outcomes of sudden cardiac arrest are provided 
in Table 1 for the 16 cases that occurred during competitive sports and in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix for the 58 cases that occurred during noncompetitive sports. Data 
sufficient to ascertain the cause of the sudden cardiac arrest among persons participating in 
competitive sports were obtained in 10 of the 16 cases. In 2 cases of nonsurvivors in which 
autopsies did not identify a cause of death, the cause of the sudden cardiac arrest was

 considered to be primary arrhythmia. In 4 cases of survivors in which no cause was 
identified after a detailed investigation, the cause of the cardiac arrest was also considered to 
be primary arrhythmia. In all 6 cases, either the cardiac structure was normal at autopsy or 
the results of the cardiac investigations, such as echocardiography or cardiac catheterization, 
were normal in the survivors.
RATES AND CAUSES OF SUDDEN CARDIAC ARREST
The sports associated with the greatest number of cases of sudden cardiac arrest among 
competitive athletes were race events and soccer (4 events each) (Table 2) and among 
noncompetitive athletes were gym workouts (12 events) and running (9 events) (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Assuming that all registered athletes are competitive athletes, 
the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest, including both survivors and nonsurvivors, during 
competition or training was 0.76 cases per 100,000 athlete-years (Table 3). Survival rates 
among competitive and noncompetitive athletes who had sudden cardiac arrest were similar 
(43.8% and 44.8%, respectively) (Table 4).
There were no significant differences in the distribution of causes of sudden cardiac arrest 
between survivors and nonsurvivors. The predominant cause of sudden cardiac arrest varied 
according to age group; among competitive and noncompetitive athletes younger than 35 
years of age, structural and primary arrhythmic causes were the most common causes, 
whereas among persons 35 to 45 years of age, coronary artery disease was the most common 
cause (Table 4). Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular 
cardiomyopathy were uncommon causes of sudden cardiac arrest. Hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy was reported as the cause of sudden cardiac arrest in 12.5% of competitive 
athletes and in 6.9% of noncompetitive athletes, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular 
cardiomyopathy was identified as the cause of sudden cardiac arrests in none of the 
competitive athletes and in 6.9% of noncompetitive athletes (Table 1, and Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
With respect to abnormalities that could potentially have been identified during 
preparticipation screening of competitive athletes, two athletes had a structural abnormality 
(i.e., hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) that was likely to be associated with an abnormal 
electrocardiogram or echocardiogram.23,24 One of the two athletes had been assessed for 
presyncope, had a normal electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, was cleared to play 
competitive sports, and had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that was diagnosed at autopsy 
(Patient 12 in Table 1). In addition, two of the competitive athletes who died had no 
structural abnormalities identified at autopsy, and therefore, the causes of sudden cardiac 
arrest in these athletes were classified as “primary arrhythmic” (Tables 1 and 4). If we 
assume that the athlete who had not previously undergone preparticipation screening and 
had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy had abnormalities that could have been identified by 
screening, and that the two athletes who died from causes classified as primary arrhythmic 
might have had a disorder that could have been detected while they were alive, we conclude 
that, at most, three of these persons could have been identified by preparticipation screening 
as being at risk for sudden cardiac arrest.

 DISCUSSION
We used data on all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests attended by EMS personnel in a defined 
region of Ontario, Canada, to determine how frequently sudden cardiac arrest occurs among 
young persons during competitive and noncompetitive sports activities. Over the course of 
the 6-year study period, we identified 16 cases of sudden cardiac arrest that occurred during 
competitive sports and 58 cases of sudden cardiac arrest that occurred during noncompetitive 
sports. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy 
were uncommon in our study population; among the 16 cases of sudden cardiac arrest that 
occurred during competitive sports, only 2 cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and no 
cases of arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy were found. Our results indicate 
that sudden cardiac death during participation in competitive sports is rare, the causes are 
varied, and more than 80% of cases would not have been identified with the use of 
systematic clinical preparticipation screening alone or in combination with 
electrocardiography-based preparticipation screening.
The absolute incidence of sudden cardiac death (i.e., sudden cardiac arrest resulting in 
death) among athletes has previously been reported to be between 1 in 80,000 and 1 in 
200,000 per year.25,26 The incidence of sudden cardiac arrest during participation in 
competitive sports in our analysis (0.76 cases per 100,000 athlete-years) is similar to that 
reported previously3,5 and includes resuscitated persons, which thus provides a more 
comprehensive estimate of the incidence. By comparison, the incidence of sudden cardiac 
arrest in the general population of the same age group has been reported to be 4.84 cases per 
100,000 person-years.22
Previous studies suggest that hypertrophic cardiomyopathy accounts for a large proportion 
of sudden cardiac arrests during participation in competitive sports in contemporary North 
American populations.27,28 In our cohort, however, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was an 
uncommon cause of sudden cardiac arrest. Possible explanations for this unexpected lower 
rate include the wider age range in our study and genetic differences among populations in 
different geographic regions; however, a similarly low prevalence has also been reported by 
others.4,29,30
The rarity of sudden cardiac arrest due to structural heart disease that we found in our 
analysis raises questions about the potential value of preparticipation screening. Structural 
heart disease, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is more likely to be detected by 
electrocardiography than other causes of sudden cardiac arrest and is frequently cited as a 
reason for undertaking preparticipation screening.31,32 In a French study10 involving 6372 
competitive athletes, 54 athletes (0.85%) were found to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 
and all 54 athletes were disqualified from competition. If all the registered athletes in our 
jurisdiction had been screened, assuming the same prevalence, approximately 3000 athletes 
may have been identified as having hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and subsequently 
disqualified. Assuming a more widely quoted prevalence rate of 1 in 500 persons with 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in the general population,33 700 athletes with hypertrophic 
cardiomyopathy could have been disqualified from competition. In contrast, we identified 2 
persons who had sudden cardiac arrest due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy among

 competitive athletes during participation in sports activities, 1 of whom had undergone 
investigations for presyncope and was subsequently cleared for competition.
Among the survivors identified in our study, none had a condition that was likely to have 
been identified by preparticipation screening. Among the persons who died, our data suggest 
that systematic preparticipation screening may have identified a maximum of 3 persons who 
were at risk for sudden cardiac arrest. This conservative estimate assumes that screening 
would have identified abnormalities in the athlete with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who 
had not previously undergone preparticipation screening and that the 2 athletes who died and 
had normal autopsy results had conditions that might have been identified by screening. In 
total, assuming that all these athletes could have been determined to be at risk for sudden 
cardiac arrest with the use of screening, at least 146,000 athletes would have had to be 
screened to identify 1 person who had sudden cardiac arrest during participation in 
competitive sports.
Our study has several important limitations. First, our analysis was a retrospective analysis, 
and the cause of death could not always be determined with certainty. We did not have 
autopsy data for all the persons in the study who died (although anatomical information was 
available from imaging or autopsy for all the competitive athletes). Second, it is possible that 
some athletes who had a risk of sudden cardiac arrest may have been identified through 
“case finding” (i.e., an athlete may have had symptoms or may have been referred for family 
assessment) and refrained from participation in sports activities, thereby removing 
themselves from the at-risk cohort of athletes. In addition, some professional athletes (a very 
small cohort) had already undergone screening. Third, we cannot exclude the possibility that 
some competitive athletes may have had cardiac arrest during participation in recreational 
sports and may subsequently have been reported as such (which would again have resulted 
in lowering the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest in the competitive-athlete group). It is also 
possible that athletes in the competitive cohort could have been counted more than once if 
they were registered in multiple sports associations with the Ontario Ministry of Tourism, 
Culture, and Sport. Fourth, we did not evaluate sudden cardiac arrest in competitive athletes 
either at rest or more than 1 hour after a sports activity. Finally, we cannot be certain that we 
have identified all competitive athletes; undercounting would have resulted in an 
underestimation of rates of sudden cardiac arrest.
In summary, we used data on out-of-hospital cardiac arrests to determine how frequently 
sudden cardiac arrest occurs during participation in competitive and noncompetitive sports 
activities among young persons. Among competitive athletes, the incidence of sudden 
cardiac arrest was estimated to be 0.76 cases per 100,000 athlete-years. Sudden cardiac 
arrest due to structural heart disease occurred infrequently during competitive sports.

 Figure 1. Identification and Classification of Out-of-Hospital Sudden Cardiac Arrest during 
Sports in Persons 12 to 45 Years of Age
All 3825 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred among persons 12 to 45 years of age 
from 2009 through 2014 and were reported in the Rescu Epistry database were filtered on 
the basis of the type of location (e.g., a recreational facility) of the cardiac arrest. All 2144 
remaining cases were then manually filtered for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests that occurred 
during or within 1 hour after a sports activity. This remaining cohort of 74 cases was 
assessed comprehensively with the use of all available records to adjudicate the cause of 
sudden cardiac arrest; cases of cardiac arrest due to noncardiac causes (e.g., hanging, 
trauma, mechanical suffocation, asphyxia from drowning, or toxic inhalation) were excluded 
from the assessment. EMS denotes emergency medical services.

†A dash indicates no diagnosis.
‡The patient had an abnormal electrocardiogram, with diffuse T wave inversions, but hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and long-QT syndrome were ruled out after expert consultation.
§The mutation detected was TNNI3 Arg141Gln.
¶In-hospital investigations confirmed the diagnosis; therefore, an autopsy was deemed unnecessary.
