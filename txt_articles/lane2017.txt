IMPORTANCE Hypoglycemia, common in patients with type 1 diabetes, is a major barrier to
achieving good glycemic control. Severe hypoglycemia can lead to coma or death.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether insulin degludec is noninferior or superior to insulin
glargine U100 in reducing the rate of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Double-blind, randomized, crossover noninferiority trial
involving 501 adults with at least 1 hypoglycemia risk factor treated at 84 US and 6 Polish
centers (January 2014-January 12, 2016) for two 32-week treatment periods, each with a
16-week titration and a 16-week maintenance period.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive once-daily insulin degludec followed
byinsulinglargineU100(n = 249)ortoreceiveinsulinglargineU100followedbyinsulindegludec
(n = 252) and randomized 1:1 to morning or evening dosing within each treatment sequence.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the rate of overall severe or
blood glucose-confirmed (<56 mg/dL) symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes during the
maintenance period. Secondary end points included the rate of nocturnal symptomatic
hypoglycemic episodes and proportion of patients with severe hypoglycemia during the
maintenance period. The noninferiority criterion for the primary end point and for the
secondary end point of nocturnal hypoglycemia was defined as an upper limit of the 2-sided
95% CI for a rate ratio of 1.10 or lower; if noninferiority was established, 2-sided statistical
testing for superiority was conducted.
RESULTS Of the 501 patients randomized (mean age, 45.9 years; 53.7% men), 395 (78.8%)
completed the trial. During the maintenance period, the rates of overall symptomatic
hypoglycemia were 2200.9 episodes per 100 person-years’ exposure (PYE) in the insulin
degludec group vs 2462.7 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group for a rate
ratio (RR) of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.94; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority;
rate difference, −130.31 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, −193.5 to −67.16). The rates of
nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia were 277.1 per 100 PYE in the insulin degludec group
vs 428.6 episodes per 100 PYE in the insulin glargine U100 group, for an RR of 0.64 (95% CI,
0.56-0.73; P < .001 for noninferiority; P < .001 for superiority; rate difference, −61.94
episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, −83.85 to −40.03). A lower proportion of patients in the
insulin degludec than in the insulin glargine U100 group experienced severe hypoglycemia
during the maintenance period (10.3%, 95% CI, 7.3%-13.3% vs 17.1%, 95% CI, 13.4%-20.8%,
respectively; McNemar P = .002; risk difference, −6.8%; 95% CI, −10.8% to −2.7%).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with type 1 diabetes and at least 1 risk factor
for hypoglycemia, 32 weeks’ treatment with insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100
resulted in a reduced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes.

ypoglycemic episodes in type 1 diabetes are fre-

tients with type 1 diabetes demonstrated lower rates of con-
firmed nocturnal hypoglycemia and no difference in overall

U100.12-14 The SWITCH 1 trial tested whether treatment with
insulin degludec was noninferior to insulin glargine U100 with
respect to rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic epi-
sodes in patients with type 1 diabetes.
Methods
Trial Design and Participants
The SWITCH 1 trial was conducted in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki15 and International Conference of
Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice.16 Prior to trial initia-
tion, the study design, protocol, consent form, and patient
information sheet were reviewed and approved by appropri-
ate health authorities, and an independent ethics committee
and institutional review board at each site (trial protocol in
Supplement 1). The review panel, which operated indepen-
dently from the investigators and study sponsor, was respon-
sible for ensuring the protection of the rights, safety, and
well-being of trial participants. All protocol amendments
were reviewed and approved as required according to local
regulations, prior to implementation. Informed written con-
sent was obtained from all participating patients before they
entered the trial. This randomized, double-blind, 2-period
crossover, multicenter, treat-to-target clinical trial involved
patients with type 1 diabetes and who had at least 1 hypogly-
cemia risk factor (eFigure 1 in Supplement 2), across 84 sites
in the United States and 6 sites in Poland between January
2014 and January 12, 2016. The trial spanned 65 weeks, con-
sisting of treatment with once-daily insulin degludec or insu-
lin glargine U100, both with insulin aspart 2- to 4-times daily
for 2 consecutive 32-week periods and 1 week of follow-up
(eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Each 32-week treatment period
consisted of a 16-week titration period (to reduce potential
carry-over effects and to obtain stable glycemic control) and a
16-week maintenance period (to compare the difference in
hypoglycemia when glycemic control and dose are stable).
Patients were included if they were at least 18 years or
older, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for 52 weeks or more,
treated with either a basal-bolus regimen or continuous sub-
cutaneous insulin infusion for 26 weeks or more; had hemo-
globin A1c (HbA1c) levels of 10% or less and a body mass index
of 45 or less (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared); fulfilled at least 1 of the following
pretrial risk criteria for developing hypoglycemia: (1) experi-
enced 1 or more severe hypoglycemic episodes within the last
year (based on American Diabetes Association [ADA]
definition)17; (2) had moderate chronic renal failure (esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2);
(3) were unaware of their hypoglycemic symptoms; (4) had
diabetes for more than 15 years; or (5) had an episode of
hypoglycemia (symptoms, blood glucose level of ≤70 mg/dL
[to convert glucose from mg/dL to mmol/L, multiply by
0.0555], or both) within the last 12 weeks. The determination
of whether a patient had hypoglycemia unawareness was
based on a patient’
s history of impaired autonomic responses
(tremulousness, sweating, palpitations, and hunger) during
hypoglycemia. Patients were excluded if they had received
insulin degludec or insulin glargine U100 within the last 26
weeks before screening. Self-reported race/ethnicity was
based on fixed categories. Noninferiority of the primary end
point was assessed initially because the overall number of
hypoglycemic episodes could be influenced by the concomi-
tant use of bolus insulin.
Interventions
Patients were randomized 1:1 with a block size of 8 using
a trial-specific central interactive voice or web-response sys-
tem that used a simple sequential allocation randomization
schedule without stratifying factors, which could be accessed
at any time by authorized persons. Patients were randomized
1:1 to one of the treatment sequences (insulin degludec
followed by insulin glargine U100 or insulin glargine U100
followed by insulin degludec) in a blinded manner. There
was a regulatory concern that the difference in the pharma-
cokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of the insulins
could affect the relative hypoglycemia; therefore, to elimi-
nate confounding, within each treatment sequence patients
were randomized 1:1 to administer basal insulin in either the
morning (from waking up to breakfast) or the evening (from
main evening meal to bedtime, Figure 1). Assigned adminis-
tration timing was maintained throughout the trial. The trial
was double-blinded; as such, all involved parties were
blinded to insulin treatment allocation throughout the trial.
Key Points
Question Is the rate of hypoglycemia noninferior or lower with
insulin degludec vs insulin glargine U100 in insulin-treated
patients with type 1 diabetes?
Findings In this randomized crossover trial of 501 patients, insulin
degludec compared with insulin glargine U100 resulted in a
significantly lower rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic
episodes over a 16-week maintenance period (2201 vs 2463
episodes per 100 patient-years of exposure).
Meaning Patients with type 1 diabetes treated with insulin
degludec, compared with insulin glargine U100, had a reduced risk
of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia.

 To maintain blinding, insulin degludec 100 U/mL (Novo
Nordisk) and insulin glargine 100 U/mL (Sanofi) were
both administered subcutaneously from identical vials via
syringes. Insulin aspart 100 U/mL was administered using
a prefilled pen (FlexPen; Novo Nordisk). The starting dose of
basal insulin and total bolus insulin (algorithm users only)
was reduced by 20% at randomization and at crossover
(ie, after 32 weeks).
Patients were supplied with a blood glucose meter and in-
structedtomeasuretheirbloodglucosebeforebreakfast,lunch,
main evening meal, and bedtime on all days throughout the
trial. Their blood glucose levels were also measured when-
ever a hypoglycemic episode was suspected. Titration of basal
insulin was performed once weekly according to the trial al-
gorithm, based on the lowest of 3 previous prebreakfast self-
measured blood glucose measurements, aiming for a fasting
target of between 71 and 90 mg/dL (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).
Titration of bolus insulin was either performed twice weekly
based on the previous 3 or 4 days’readings according to the
providedalgorithm(eTable2inSupplement2),orseveraltimes
daily based on the insulin:carbohydrate ratio and insulin sen-
sitivity factor, to achieve a preprandial blood glucose target of
between 71 and 108 mg/dL. Only those patients experienced
in carbohydrate counting could use the latter approach. Dur-
ing the initial 8 weeks of the first treatment period, patients
could change from carbohydrate counting to use of the bolus
algorithm, but not vice versa.
End Points
The primary end point was the rate of overall severe or blood
glucose–confirmed (<56 mg/dL) symptomatic hypoglycemic
episodes during the maintenance period (weeks 16-32 and 48-
64). Severe hypoglycemia was defined according to the ADA
definition, an episode requiring assistance of another person
to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or take other
corrective actions, neurological recovery following the re-
turn of plasma glucose to normal, or both.17 The hypoglyce-
mia definition is illustrated in eFigure 2 in Supplement 2.
The secondary end points were the rate of nocturnal (se-
vere or blood glucose–confirmed episodes between 12:01 AM
and 5:59 AM, both inclusive) symptomatic hypoglycemic epi-
sodes, and the proportion of patients experiencing severe
hypoglycemia, both occurring during the maintenance
period. Other hypoglycemic end points included rates of
severe hypoglycemia; overall symptomatic and nocturnal
symptomatic hypoglycemia in the full treatment period; rate
of severe hypoglycemia in the maintenance period; and pro-
portion of patients with severe hypoglycemia, overall symp-
tomatic, and nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia during
the maintenance period and the full treatment period. All
severe hypoglycemic episodes reported by investigators or
identified by a predefined Medical Dictionary for Regulatory
Activities version 18.1 (MedDRA) search of safety data were
adjudicated prospectively by an external committee; only con-
firmed episodes were analyzed (eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
The efficacy end points measured were change in HbA1c,

cluded daily basal, bolus, and total insulin doses; change from

(including blood pressure and pulse); funduscopy and electro-
cardiogram results; and standard biochemical parameters.
Statistical Analysis
Analyses of all end points were based on the full analysis set
(all randomized patients) following the intention-to-treat prin-
ciple using SAS statistical software version 9.4 (SAS Institute
Inc). Efficacy end points were summarized based on the full
analysis set. Safety end points were summarized based on the
safety analysis set (patients exposed to at least 1 dose of in-
vestigational product or comparator).
Missing data were explored to ascertain whether the pa-
tientswhodroppedoutbeforethefirstmaintenanceperioddif-
fered from those exposed during the first maintenance period
because information from these patients was not included in
theprimaryanalysis.Missingdatawerealsoinvestigatedtoiden-
tify any differences in dropouts between the 2 treatments. The
effects of missing data on the primary analysis were investi-
gated with a post hoc tipping-point analysis. Missing data were
imputed assuming that the rate of hypoglycemia for patients
who had not completed the trial was similar to that of patients
whocompletedthesametreatmentperiodandwhohadasimi-
lar number of episodes prior to withdrawal. The imputed num-
ber of episodes for patients withdrawing from insulin de-
gludec was gradually increased until the treatment contrast
between the 2 insulins was no longer significant.
A hierarchical testing procedure was specified to adjust for
multiplicity and control the type I error in the strong sense for
the primary and secondary end points. Noninferiority of re-
duction in HbA1c with a noninferiority margin of 0.4% in both
treatment periods was a prerequisite to initiation of the test
hierarchy (eFigure 3 in Supplement 2).
The test hierarchy specified that following the noninferi-
ority criterion for HbA1c reduction, the primary end point was
tested for noninferiority. If this criterion was achieved, then
the primary end point was subsequently tested for superior-
ity.Thiswasalsothecaseforthefirstsecondaryendpoint.Non-
inferiority was defined as the upper limit of the 95% CI for the
estimated rate ratio of 1.10 or less. Superiority was achieved if
the upper limit of the 95% CI for the rate ratio was less than
1.0. The last secondary end point, proportion with severe hy-
poglycemia,wasdirectlytestedforsuperiority,whichwascon-
firmed if the McNemar test was significant on a 5% signifi-
cance level. This margin was selected based on ADA guidance
defining a 10% to 20% reduction in hypoglycemia as clini-
cally relevant.18 The primary and first secondary multiplicity-
adjusted analyses were prespecified to be tested with 1-sided
tests on a 2.5% level. Other analyses were tested with 2-sided
tests on a 5% level.
The trial was powered to show noninferiority of the pri-
mary end point. Based on the assumption that up to 10% of the
randomized patients may not contribute to the analysis, 400
patientsneededtocontributetotheanalysisif446patientswere
randomized to ensure a power of 94%, to demonstrate nonin-
feriority with an expected rate of overall symptomatic hypo-
glycemia of 5.0 episodes per patient-years’exposure (PYE).19

 A Poisson model with patients as a random effect; treat-
ment, period, sequence, and dosing time as fixed effects;
and logarithm of the observation time (100 years) as offset
was prespecified as the primary analysis to estimate the rate
ratio of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia during the main-
tenance period. Only patients with positive observation
time during the maintenance contributed to the estimated
rate ratio.
Sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robust-
ness of the results, using patients exposed in both mainte-
nance periods only, completers only, and using a negative bi-
nomial model; further details are available in the statistical
analysis plan provided as part of Supplement 1.
A post hoc analysis of the absolute difference in hypogly-
cemiaratewasconductedusinganonlinearPoissonmodelwith
a specified mean parameter, measuring the difference be-
tweenaveragenonexistingpatientstakinginsulindegludecfol-
lowed by insulin glargine U100, respectively (50% treatment
period 1, 50% evening dose, 50% treatment sequence insulin
degludec followed by insulin glargine U100).
TheMcNemarnonparametrictestwasprespecifiedtocom-
pare the 2 treatments with respect to the secondary outcome
of the proportion of patients experiencing severe hypoglyce-
mia, using 2-sided testing and a 5% significance level. In or-
dertoquantifythedifferencesinproportionswith95%CIspost
hoc,abinomialdistributionwithcorrelatedmeasurementswas
assumed.
Change from baseline in HbA1c after 32 weeks of treat-
ment was analyzed separately for each treatment period, with
a mixed model for repeated measurements including treat-
ment, visit, sex, region, pretrial insulin regimen, and dosing
time as fixed effects, and age and baseline HbA1c as covari-
ates. All fixed factors and covariates are nested within visit.
Dosing time was a factor with 2 levels: morning and evening;
region was also a factor with 2 levels: Poland and the United
States. Pretrial insulin regimen was a factor with 3 levels: con-
tinuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, once-daily basal in-
sulin injections, or twice-daily basal insulin injections.
Post hoc statistical analysis of the estimated treatment dif-
ference for the difference in absolute fasting plasma glucose
values was performed using an analysis of covariance model
with treatment, period, sex, region, pretrial insulin treat-
ment, and dosing time as fixed effects, patient as random ef-
fect, and age and fasting plasma glucose at randomization as
covariates.
The post hoc analysis of insulin dose was conducted on
patients with observation time in the first maintenance pe-
riod, with a mixed model for repeated measurements with
treatment, period, dosing time, and visit as fixed effects; pa-
tient as random effect; and the log-transformed baseline dose
as covariate. All fixed effects and the covariate were nested
within visit.
Results
Of 634 patients screened, 501 were randomized. Two hun-
dred forty-nine patients were randomized to receive insulin
degludec followed by insulin glargine U100, and 252
patients were randomized to receive insulin glargine U100
followed by insulin degludec, with 50.1% randomized
to the morning and 49.9% to the evening dosing schedule,
all of whom were included in the full analysis set. One
patient withdrew before treatment exposure. Overall, 395
(78.8%) patients completed the trial (Figure 1). The propor-
tion of patients and the reasons for withdrawing from the
trial were similar between treatments (insulin degludec,
11.0%; insulin glargine U100, 12.2%). The most common
reasons for withdrawal in both treatment groups were with-
drawal by patient and adverse events (Figure 1). Patients
discontinuing before the first maintenance period were
similar to those with observation time during the first main-
tenance period.
Baseline characteristics and insulin treatment at screen-
ing are summarized in Table 1. Patients were a mean age of 45.9
years (SD, 14.2) and had a mean duration of diabetes of 23.4
years(SD,13.4).Atscreening,19.4%wereusingcontinuoussub-
cutaneous insulin infusion, 44.7% were using once-daily basal
insulin, and 35.7% were using twice-daily basal insulin (both
combined with 2-4 bolus insulin injections).
Primary End Point
The rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycemia during the
maintenance period were significantly lower with insulin
degludec (2200.9 episodes per 100 PYE) than with insulin
glargine U100 (2462.7 episodes per 100 PYE), for a rate ratio
of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.85-0.94; P < .001). Because the upper
bound of the 95% CI was lower than 1.00, noninferiority
was confirmed (P < .001) and superiority was demonstrated
(P < .001), meeting the primary objective (Figure 2A,
Table 2). An analysis of the rate difference was also signifi-
cant (−130.31 episodes per 100 PYE; 95% CI, −193.5 to
−67.16), with a similar proportion of patients experiencing
episodes (77.3% vs 79.9%; risk difference, –2.6%; 95% CI,
–6.9% to 1.7%). Sensitivity analyses supported the findings
of the primary analysis of the primary end point (eFigure 4
in Supplement 2). The post hoc tipping-point analysis
showed that the statistically significant difference between
the 2 treatments remained until each noncompleter taking
insulin degludec was assumed to have experienced an addi-
tional 12 episodes compared with 0 additional episodes for
noncompleters taking insulin glargine. The additional 12
events for noncompleters taking insulin degludec corre-
sponded to a rate of 5316 episodes per 100 PYE compared
with the observed rate of 2212 episodes per 100 PYE for
insulin degludec completers (mean number of events, 17.1 vs
6.8; eTable 4 in Supplement 2).
Secondary End Points
The rate of nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemia during the
maintenance period was 277.1 episodes per 100 PYE for
insulin degludec vs 428.6 episodes per 100 PYE for insulin
glargine U100, for a rate ratio of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.56-0.73;
P < .001 for noninferiority), meeting criteria for noninferior-
ity and also demonstrating a significant difference (P < .001)
for superiority, with a rate difference of −61.94 episodes

 per 100 PYE (95% CI, −83.85 to −40.03), and similarly a sig-
nificantly lower proportion of patients with episodes with
insulin degludec than with insulin glargine U100 (32.8% vs
43.1%; risk difference, –10.4%; 95% CI, –15.8% to –4.9%;
Figure 2B, Table 2). Sensitivity analyses supported the find-
ings of the primary analysis of this secondary end point
(eFigure 4 in Supplement 2).
The proportion of patients experiencing a severe hypo-
glycemic episode during the maintenance period was signifi-
cantly lower in the insulin degludec group than in the insulin
glargine U100 group (10.3%; 95% CI, 7.3%-13.3% vs 17.1%; 95%
CI, 13.4%-20.8%, respectively; P = .002). An analysis of the dif-
ference in proportion was also statistically significant (−6.8%;
95% CI, −10.8% to −2.7%).

Hypoglycemia
During the full 32-week treatment period, use of insulin de-
gludec had fewer overall symptomatic hypoglycemic epi-
sodes than insulin glargine (2044.6 vs 2168.4 episodes per 100
PYE) with a rate ratio of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.91-0.98; P = .002) and
a rate difference of −66.17 (95% CI, −108.8 to −23.55) and had
fewer nocturnal symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes than in-
sulin glargine (281.2 vs 371.9 episodes per 100 PYE) for a rate
ratio of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.68-0.83: P < .001) and a rate differ-
ence of −39.35 (95% CI, −54.09 to −24.61; Figure 2B and D,
Table 2).
The rate for episodes of severe hypoglycemia was signifi-
cantly lower during the maintenance period among those
treated with insulin degludec than those treated with insulin
glargine U100 (69.1 vs 92.2 episodes per 100 PYE) for a rate
ratio of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.48-0.89, P = .007) and a rate differ-
ence of −13.65 (95% CI, −23.66 to −3.65). This trend contin-
ued during the full treatment period (86.8 vs 105.2 episodes
per 100 PYE) for a rate ratio of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.61-0.90;
P = .003) and a rate difference of −6.84 (95% CI, −11.73 to
−1.96; Figure 2E and F, Table 2). The difference in propor-
tions of patients experiencing 1 or more episodes during the
maintenance period was not significantly different overall
but was significantly different for nocturnal symptomatic
hypoglycemia. The results were consistent for the full treat-
ment period (Table 2).
Glycemic Control
Observed mean HbA1c levels at the end of the first treat-
ment period were 6.92% for insulin degludec vs 6.78%
for insulin glargine U100 (estimated treatment difference,

 0.03 percentage-points; 95% CI, –0.10 to 0.15). At the end of
the second treatment period, the mean HbA1c levels were
6.95% for insulin degludec vs 6.97% for insulin glargine
U100 (estimated treatment difference, 0.11 percentage-
points; 95% CI, –0.00 to 0.23; Figure 3A). Noninferiority of
insulin degludec to insulin glargine U100 with respect to
change in HbA1c values from baseline was confirmed for
both treatment periods.
At the end of the first treatment period, the observed mean
(SD) fasting plasma glucose levels decreased in the group re-
ceivinginsulindegludecfollowedbyinsulinglargineU100from
165.1 mg/dL (77.3) at baseline to 134.3 mg/dL (64.4), with an
increase when switched to insulin glargine U100 in the sec-
ond treatment period to 155.3 mg/dL (76.4). A decrease in fast-
ing plasma glucose levels was also observed in the first treat-
ment period for the group treated with insulin glargine U100
followed by insulin degludec, from 174.4 mg/dL (81.7) at base-
line to 146.3 mg/dL (64.1), which was further decreased when
switched to insulin degludec in the second treatment period
to 135.9 mg/dL (66.3; Figure 3B).
Post hoc analysis showed a significant reduction in
fasting plasma glucose with insulin degludec compared
with insulin glargine U100 after 32 weeks of treatment for
an estimated treatment difference of –17.0 mg/dL (95% CI,
–25.5 to –8.41 mg/dL; P < .001). The mean prebreakfast
self-measured blood glucose level (used for basal dose
adjustment) increased for both groups during the first week
after randomization, reflecting the recommended 20% dose
reduction, and decreased throughout titration period 1
before stabilizing. Insulin degludec decreased self-measured
blood glucose levels more rapidly than insulin glargine U100
(eFigure 5 in Supplement 2). In the second treatment period,

and with baseline hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) and age as covariates.
All fixed factors and covariates are

 mean self-measured blood glucose levels for those switching
from insulin degludec to insulin glargine U100 increased
during the first 3 weeks (again corresponding to the recom-
mended 20% dose reduction) and declined thereafter,
before stabilizing; in contrast, mean self-measured blood
glucose values for those switching from insulin glargine
U100 to insulin degludec remained at a similar level
throughout (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2).
Insulin Dose and Body Weight
Mean basal, bolus, and total insulin doses are summarized in
eTable 5 in Supplement 2. At the end of the first treatment pe-
riod, the observed mean dose increased in the group receiving
insulin degludec followed by insulin glargine U100 from 29 U
atbaselineto39U.AfterswitchingtoinsulinglargineU100,the
dose at the end of the second treatment period was 41 U. An in-
crease in dose was also observed in the first treatment period
for the group receiving insulin glargine U100 followed by insu-
lin degludec, from 24 U at baseline to 36 U. After switching to
insulin degludec, the dose at the end of the second treatment
period was 37 U (eTable 5 in Supplement 2). The bolus insulin
dose was stable throughout the trial in both treatment groups.
Consequently, the total insulin dose followed the same pat-
tern as the basal insulin dose. Post hoc analysis showed a 3%
lower basal insulin dose and a 3% lower total insulin dose with
insulindegludecthanwithinsulinglargineU100after32weeks
of treatment; both results were significant, with an estimated
treatment ratio of 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = .02) and 0.97
(95% CI, 0.95-0.99; P = .01), respectively.
Weight changes were not significantly different between
groups during the first treatment period (2.6 kg vs 2.7 kg; dif-
ference, –0.25 kg; 95% CI, –0.99 kg to 0.49 kg; P = .51) and the
second treatment period (0.7 kg vs 0.0 kg; difference, 0.75 kg;
95% CI, –0.04 kg to 1.55 kg; P = .06).
Adverse Events
Rates of adverse events were 356.8 and 358.5 events per 100
PYE with insulin degludec and insulin glargine U100, and
rates of serious adverse events were 39.0 and 45.1 events
per 100 PYE, respectively (eTable 6 in Supplement 2). The
most commonly reported adverse events experienced by 5%
or more patients in the insulin degludec and insulin glargine
U100 treatment groups were nasopharyngitis (15.0% and
13.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (6.4% and 8.5%),
and hypoglycemia (3.7% and 7.2%), respectively.
In total, 4 patients died during the trial. One patient tak-
ing insulin degludec died as a result of smoke inhalation.
Three deaths among patients taking insulin glargine U100
were reported: 1 occurred during treatment, resulting from
acute coronary syndrome; the other 2 (1 from pneumonia, 1
cardiac death) occurred during follow-up. There were 2
major adverse cardiovascular events confirmed by adjudica-
tion for insulin degludec (1 nonfatal myocardial infarction, 1
nonfatal stroke). For insulin glargine U100, 2 nonfatal myo-
cardial infarctions were confirmed.
There were no clinically relevant differences in physical
examinations, blood pressure, pulse, electrocardiograms, fun-
duscopy, or biochemical parameters between treatments.
Discussion
In this double-blind, treat-to-target, crossover trial, insulin de-
gludec compared with insulin glargine U100 resulted in lower
rates of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes and noc-
turnal symptomatic hypoglycemia in the 16-week mainte-
nanceperiodandalowerproportionofpatientswithsevereepi-
sodes in the 16-week maintenance period. These findings were
consistent when analyzed over the full 32-week treatment pe-
riod.Thereductionofhypoglycemiainthistrial,reflectedinboth
theratesandtheproportionsofseverehypoglycemia,weresimi-
lar in size to those observed in a meta-analysis of patients with
type 1 diabetes comparing long-acting analogs (insulin glargine
and detemir) with neutral protamine Hagedorn (severe hypo-
glycemia odds ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60-0.89)20 and in a re-
cently conducted randomized trial (severe hypoglycemia odds
ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.19-0.84).6
Severe hypoglycemia has been associated with an in-
creased risk of subsequent mortality, morbidity, and cardio-
vascular events and, for patients with diabetes, is the most se-
rious adverse effect of insulin therapy, and can result in costly
hospitalization.1,6,13,21-26 Therefore, reducing the risk of se-
vere hypoglycemia could represent a clinically important
improvement.27 Less hypoglycemia was observed in the con-
text of achieving an HbA1c level lower than 7% during treat-
ment with both insulin degludec and with insulin glargine
U100, a target recommended by the ADA.28 In addition, sev-
eral mechanisms were established to confirm the validity of
reported hypoglycemic episodes. The trial was designed as a
double-blinded, crossover, treat-to-target design that sup-
ported the objective of capturing all episodes, and all epi-
sodes of severe hypoglycemia were evaluated by an external
blinded adjudication committee.
This trial has several limitations. First, intensive patient
monitoring occurred in the trial setting and may have affected
the frequency with which hypoglycemia was collected and re-
ported compared with the actual clinical setting. However, this
type of intensive monitoring may have provided a more accu-
raterepresentationofhypoglycemiaratesinapopulationinclud-
ingpatientswithrecurrenthypoglycemiathanwouldbederived
from observational studies or randomized clinical trials from
which such patients are typically excluded. Second, the cross-
over design has an inherent potential for carryover; however,

lowing a 16-week wash-out and titration period. Third, the
higher-than-expected withdrawal rate may have been a result
of the demanding nature of the trial, including its 64-week du-
ration, 2 different treatments, and the use of vial and syringe.
Conclusions
Among patients with type 1 diabetes and at least 1 risk factor
for hypoglycemia, treatment for 32 weeks with insulin de-
gludec compared with insulin glargine U100 resulted in a re-
duced rate of overall symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes.
