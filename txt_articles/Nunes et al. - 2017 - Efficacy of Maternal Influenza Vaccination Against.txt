Background. Influenza immunization of pregnant women protects their young infants against laboratory-confirmed influenza 
infection. Influenza infection might predispose to subsequent bacterial infections that cause severe pneumonia. In a secondary anal-
ysis of a randomized clinical trial (RCT), we evaluated the effect of maternal vaccination on infant hospitalizations for all-cause acute 
lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI).
Methods. Infants born to women who participated in a double-blind placebo-controlled RCT in 2011 and 2012 on the efficacy 
of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) during pregnancy were followed during the first 6 months of life.
Results. The study included 1026 infants born to IIV recipients and 1023 born to placebo recipients. There were 52 ALRI hospi-
talizations (median age, 72 days). The incidence (per 1000 infant-months) of ALRI hospitalizations was lower in infants born to IIV 
recipients (3.4 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 2.2–5.4]; 19 cases) compared with placebo recipients (6.0 [95% CI, 4.3–8.5]; 33 cases) 
with a vaccine efficacy of 43.1% (P = .050). Thirty of the ALRI hospitalizations occurred during the first 90 days of life, 9 in the IIV 
group (3.0 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]) and 21 in the placebo group (7.2 [95% CI, 4.7–11.0]) (incidence rate ratio, 0.43 [95% CI, .19–.93]) for 
a vaccine efficacy of 57.5% (P = .032). The incidence of ALRI hospitalizations was similar in the IIV and placebo group for infants >3 
months of age. Forty-four of the hospitalized infants were tested for influenza virus infection and 1 tested positive.
Conclusions. Using an RCT as a vaccine probe, influenza vaccination during pregnancy decreased all-cause ALRI hospitaliza-
tion during the first 3 months of life, suggesting possible protection against subsequent bacterial infections that influenza infection 
might predispose to.

Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs), such as pneumonia 
and bronchiolitis, are important causes of morbidity and mortality 
in children. Although the incidence of childhood ALRI mortality 
has declined in the past decade, an estimated 0.9 million children 
younger than 5 years died from pneumonia in 2015, including 
0.5 million child pneumonia deaths in sub-Saharan Africa [1]. 
Furthermore, there were approximately 15 million episodes of 
under-5 childhood pneumonia hospitalizations in 2010, with the 
incidence of hospitalization being >3 times higher in newborns 
and almost 1.3 times higher in the 0- to 11-month age group com-
pared with the overall rate in children 0–59 months of age [2].
Temporal associations between influenza virus circulation 
and pneumonia hospitalization, which might be due to primary 
viral or secondary bacterial pneumonia, have been reported 
[3–5]. A large study in the United States compared the rates 
of hospitalization for acute cardiopulmonary conditions dur-
ing influenza seasons to noninfluenza winter time periods 
and estimated the average annual hospitalization rate attrib-
utable to influenza to be highest for infants <6 months of age 
(104 hospitalizations/10 000 children), compared with children

6–12 months and 1–3 years of age (50/10 000 and 19/10 000, 
respectively) [6]. Several lines of evidence support a patho-
genic synergism between influenza virus and respiratory bac-
teria. Influenza infections in children increases the risk of new 
Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype acquisition; and because 
nasopharyngeal acquisition of a new serotype increases the risk 
of pneumococcal diseases, influenza infections may therefore 
predispose to the development of bacterial diseases [7, 8].
While active influenza vaccination is the most efficient way 
to prevent influenza virus infection, current vaccines are poorly 
immunogenic and not licensed for use in infants <6 months of 
age. An alternative strategy to prevent influenza illness in young 
infants is vaccination of pregnant women to achieve passive 
protection through transplacental transfer of antibodies [9–11]. 
Vaccination of pregnant women with inactivated influenza 
vaccine (IIV) is immunogenic and protects the women and 
their infants against influenza illness [9–11]. Recently we also 
reported that efficacy of IIV vaccination during pregnancy on 
preventing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–confirmed influ-
enza infection in the infants was 86% during the first 8 weeks of 
life, which decreased to 49% if considering the overall 6-month 
follow-up period, corresponding to the reduction in maternally 
acquired influenza antibodies in the infants [12].
Population-based and case-control studies on the effect of influ-
enza vaccination during pregnancy on more severe outcomes in 
infants, including hospitalizations, have reported conflicting results 
[13–19]. The objective of this post hoc analysis of a randomized, 
placebo-controlled trial was to probe the association of influenza 
vaccination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–uninfected 
pregnant women in preventing ALRI hospitalization in their 
infants <6 months of age [10]. The present analysis was restricted 
to infants born to women enrolled in the HIV-uninfected cohort.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study Design
Details of the study have been published [10]. In brief, we con-
ducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
IIV in HIV-uninfected pregnant women in Soweto, South Africa. 
This involved 2 cohorts of HIV-uninfected pregnant women in 
their second/third trimester who were enrolled from 3 March to 
4 August 2011 (n = 1060) and 6 March to 2 July 2012 (n = 1056). 
Women and their infants were followed up to 6 months postpar-
tum. The present report describes results from the infants born to 
the mothers enrolled in the study. The study used the trivalent IIV 
recommended by the World Health Organization for the Southern 
Hemisphere for both the 2011 and 2012 influenza seasons (A/
California/7/2009, A/Victoria/210/2009 and B/Brisbane/60/2008-
like virus; VAXIGRIP; Sanofi-Pasteur, Lyon, France) [20, 21], and 
sterile 0.9% normal saline solution as placebo (1:1).
Surveillance of Participants 
Active surveillance for acute respiratory illness was done by 
weekly contact of the study participants throughout the study 
period. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected when infants 
(i) attended the study center for any unsolicited respiratory 
illness; (ii) were hospitalized for acute cardiopulmonary illness 
at the single public hospital serving the study population; or 
(iii) were identified through weekly contacts as having signs or 
symptoms of respiratory illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were 
collected in universal transport medium (Copan, Brescia, Italy) 
and transported to the study laboratory where samples were 
immediately tested by qualitative real-time reverse transcrip-
tion PCR assay for influenza; the remaining specimens were 
stored and tested at a later stage for Bordetella pertussis, respira-
tory syncytial virus (RSV), and rhinovirus by PCR.
All-cause hospital admissions were documented and for 
the current analysis, hospitalizations for ALRI were defined 
as a discharge with a principal or secondary diagnosis with an 
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-
10) codes of 1 or more of the following: pneumonia (J12–J18), 
bronchiolitis (J21), or an unspecified acute lower respiratory 
tract infection (J22). To account for misclassification of con-
genital pneumonia and other causes of respiratory distress dur-
ing the newborn period, only hospitalized infants older than 
7 days were included in the analyses. The diagnosis of neona-
tal jaundice, unspecified (P59.9) was analyzed as an outcome 
that should be unaffected by vaccine exposure. Bacterial cul-
tures from a normally sterile site (eg, cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], 
blood, or pleural fluid) were performed at the discretion of the 
attending physician and results were available to the study team.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses of study outcomes were performed under the prin-
ciple of intention-to-treat, defined as infants born any time 
after their mothers’ vaccination. A respiratory pathogen was 
associated with a hospitalization if it was detected by PCR on 
a respiratory specimen collected within 2 weeks of the date of 
hospital admission.
Incidence rates of ALRI hospitalizations were calculated as 
incidence density using Poisson regression and person-time as 
denominator; incidence rate ratios were estimated between the 
IIV group and placebo group. Time-to-event data were censored 
after the first ALRI hospitalization or at study termination (max-
imum 175 days of age). Between-group differences in the time to 
the ALRI episode were compared in survival analyses by means 
of the log-rank test. The South African influenza seasons were 
defined using the National Institute for Communicable Diseases 
surveillance data; the influenza epidemic periods were from 
16 May to 6 November 2011 and from 21 May to 14 October 
2012 [10, 22]. An exploratory analysis was done restricted to 
the hospitalizations that occurred within the influenza sea-
sons ±2 weeks (extended influenza season period) to account 
for possible events that lag in time to influenza virus infection. 
Proportions were compared by χ2 or Fisher exact test and demo-
graphic continuous variables by Student t test or Mann-Whitney

test. Logistic regression was performed to adjust the analysis for 
sex and low birth weight. P values ≤ .05 were considered sig-
nificant. Study data were collected and managed using Research 
Electronic Data Capture (REDCap). Analyses were performed 
using Stata version 13.1 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas).
Ethical Considerations
The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics 
Committee of the University of the Witwatersrand (101106), 
was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01306669), and was 
conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guide-
lines. Mothers provided written informed consent for them-
selves and their infants.
RESULTS
A total of 2049 live births were recorded from pregnant women 
enrolled in the study, including 1026 to IIV recipients and 1023 
to placebo recipients (Table 1). Infants were born a mean of 
81 days (range, 1–175 days) after maternal vaccination and fol-
lowed up for a median of 172 days (interquartile range [IQR], 
168–175). The baseline demographics and follow-up period 
were similar between infants in the IIV and placebo groups 
(Table 1). Due to the primary objective of the study and when 
enrollment occurred, most of the follow-up time of the infants 
on the study was during the periods of extended influenza cir-
culation, with an overall 11 201 months of follow-up, of which 
6514 months were during the extended influenza seasons. 
Infants were particularly exposed to influenza virus during the 
first 90 days of life (5933 months of total follow-up, of which 
4743 [80.4%] months were during the extended influenza sea-
sons) compared to during 91–175 days of life (5268 months of 
total follow-up, of which 1771 [33.6%] months were during the 
extended influenza seasons).
Three hundred fourteen infants had at least 1 hospital admis-
sion during the study follow-up period; of these, 151 were born 
to IIV recipients and 163 to placebo recipients (risk ratio, 0.92 
[95% confidence interval {CI}, .75–1.1]; P = .42). Fifty-two 
infants at a median age of 72 days (IQR, 32–131) were hospital-
ized for physician-diagnosed ALRI during the follow-up period. 
Only 2 of the hospitalized infants with ALRI were born <28 days 
after their mothers were vaccinated (18 and 25 days, both to IIV 
recipients). Of the 52 hospitalized infants, 11.5% were born at 
<37 weeks of gestational age compared with 9.4% of the 1997 
nonhospitalized infants (P = .67), 21.2% (11/52) had a birth 
weight of <2500 g compared with 12.2% (244/1993) of nonhos-
pitalized infants (P = .055), and boys were more frequently hos-
pitalized for ALRI (67.3% [35/52]) than girls (P = .033).
Of the 52 hospitalized infants with ALRI, 19 were born to 
IIV recipients and 33 to placebo recipients for a vaccine efficacy 
of 43.1% (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 0.57 [95% CI, .32–1.0]; 
P = .050; Table 2 and Figure 1). Time to ALRI hospitalization 
was longer in the IIV group compared with the placebo group 
(P = .047; Figure 1). Thirty (57.7%) ALRI hospitalizations 
occurred during the first 90 days of life, 9 in the IIV group 
(47.4%) and 21 in the placebo group (63.6%). The incidence 
(per 1000 infant-months) of ALRI hospitalization was lower in 
infants born to IIV recipients (3.0 [95% CI, 1.6–5.9]) compared 
to placebo recipients (7.2 [95% CI, 4.7–11.0]) (IRR, 0.43 [95% 
CI, .19–.93]; P = .032) for a vaccine efficacy of 57.5% during 
the first 90 days of life. In infants >90 days of age, the incidence 
(per 1000 infant-months) of ALRI hospitalization was similar 
between the IIV group (3.8 [95% CI, 2.0–7.1]) and placebo 
group (4.6 [95% CI, 2.6–8.1]) (IRR, 0.83 [95% CI, .36–1.9]; 
P = .66; Table 2). Similar estimates were obtained when restrict-
ing the ALRI hospitalizations to those that occurred during the 
extended influenza seasons (Table 2). Outside the influenza 
season period, although a similar trend was observed, numbers 
were too small for further stratification by age group.
The median length of ALRI hospitalization was similar in the 
IIV group (4 [IQR, 2–8] days) and the placebo group (6 [IQR, 
3–8] days; P = .64). Forty-four of the ALRI hospitalized infants 
(84.6%) had a respiratory sample collected during (n = 35) or 
within 5 days of hospitalization (n = 9) that were tested by PCR 
for influenza virus, of whom only 1 infant (71 days old in the 
placebo group) tested positive. Of these respiratory samples, 41 
(93.2%) were available and further tested by PCR for Bordetella 
pertussis and RSV and 36 (81.8%) were tested for rhinovirus. 
Bordetella pertussis was identified in 3 infants (2 [11.8%] in the 
IIV group and 1 [4.2%] in the placebo group), RSV in 12 (4 
[23.5%] in the IIV group and 8 [33.3%] in the placebo group; P 
= .73), and rhinovirus in 11 infants (3 [21.4%] in the IIV group 
and 8 [36.4%] in the placebo group; P = .47).
Of the 52 hospitalized ALRI cases, blood cultures were per-
formed in 26 (50%) infants (57.9% of 19 cases in the IIV group 
and 45.5% of 33 in the placebo group) and CSF cultures in 17 
(32.7%) infants (42.1% of the IIV group and 27.3% of the pla-
cebo group). No pathogenic bacteria were isolated from the 
blood or CSF specimens.

 Protection Against ALRI Hospitalizations • CID 2017:65 (1 October) • 1069
One infant in the IIV group who was diagnosed with sus-
pected pertussis associated with pneumonia died in hospital at 
61 days of age. Two infants in the placebo group died at home 
11 days postdischarge at 84 and 173 days of age. During the 
first 90 days of life, 93 infants were hospitalized with jaundice; 
47 born to IIV recipients and 46 to placebo recipients (IRR, 1.0 
[95% CI, .68–1.5]; P = .92).
DISCUSSION
Using our randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial as a 
vaccine probe, we demonstrate that vaccination with IIV during 
pregnancy reduced the risk for all-cause ALRI hospitalization 
by 57.5% during the first 90 days of life. Notably, this observa-
tion was independent of identifying influenza virus among the 
ALRI cases. This suggests that the benefits of protecting against 
influenza virus infection during early infancy might extend 
beyond protecting only against influenza-confirmed illness. 
While the paucity of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospi-
talizations may be partly explained by inadequate sample or 
imperfect test sensitivity, it is also likely that the influenza virus 
may initiate a causal chain of events and no longer be present 
or detectable at the time of hospitalization. For example, a pri-
mary influenza virus infection, including possibly subclinical 
or mild infection, may increase susceptibility to new bacterial 
nasopharyngeal acquisition, as well as increase density of pres-
ent colonizing bacteria, with disease from these bacteria only 
manifesting a few weeks later and beyond when influenza virus 
shedding has cased [3, 23]. This hypothesis is corroborated 
by a previous report from a randomized clinical trial (RCT) 
of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, in which was shown that 
by protecting against pneumococcal disease, there was also a 
decrease in hospitalizations for influenza, RSV, human metap-
neumovirus, and polyomavirus-associated ALRI [24–26]. The 
current data suggest that protecting against these virus-associ-
ated infections could conversely protect against bacterial infec-
tions. The failure to identify bacterial etiology among our cases 
is not surprising, considering the lack of a sensitive diagnostic 
tool to diagnose bacterial pneumonia, including the sensitivity 
of blood culture only being <5% for diagnosing bacterial pneu-
monia in children [27].
Epidemiological evidence from influenza epidemics and ani-
mal challenge models have demonstrated that influenza virus 
infection can enhance the susceptibility to infection with bacte-
ria [28, 29], including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus 
influenzae, and Staphylococcus aureus [23, 30–32]. In a South 
African study among patients hospitalized with ALRI, infection 
with influenza virus was associated with S. pneumoniae colo-
nization and patients with a respiratory virus coinfection had 
significantly higher colonization densities and, consecutively,

increased risk of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia [33]. The 
co-pathogenesis between influenza and superinfecting bac-
teria is complex and multifactorial, with sequential infections 
being challenging to correctly diagnose if the first pathogen has 
cleared by the time the patient presents with secondary bac-
terial complications [3]. In the case of S. pneumoniae, a new 
serotype acquisition is associated with increased susceptibility 
to developing disease up until 2 months later, by which time 
influenza shedding may no longer be present [8]. Likewise, it is 
biologically plausible that a preceding influenza infection could 
lead to airway changes that predispose to more severe disease 
with subsequent infections as well.
Using a vaccine-probe approach, we estimated that for every 
1000 pregnant women vaccinated with influenza vaccine, 4 
ALRI hospitalizations could be prevented in infants <3 months 
of age. Two-thirds of the ALRI hospitalizations in the placebo 
group occurred during the first 3 months of life, corroborating 
that very young infants are at increased risk of severe pneumo-
nia [6, 34]. The observation from our trial that even in older 
infants, who had less exposure to the influenza season, >50% 
of the hospitalizations occurred during the periods of influenza 
circulation supports the temporal association of influenza virus 
infections and ALRI hospitalizations.
This is the first RCT, to our knowledge, which has measured 
the efficacy of influenza vaccination during pregnancy on severe 
respiratory outcomes in infants. Two earlier large retrospective 
cohort studies from the United States did not find an associa-
tion of influenza vaccination during pregnancy and the rates 
of acute respiratory illness among their infants [14, 17]. These 
studies were, however, limited either by the study design or the 
absolute rates of hospitalization in the infants being very low, 
limiting the statistical power [14, 17]. In another prospective 
cohort study in the White Mountain and Navajo reservations in 
the United States, Eick et al reported a nonsignificant associa-
tion between maternal influenza vaccination and influenza-like 
illness in the infants; however, when the outcome was restricted 
to influenza-like illness requiring hospitalization, a 39% reduc-
tion in risk (risk ratio, 0.61 [95% CI, .45–.84]) was found for 
infants born to IIV-vaccinated compared with unvaccinated 
mothers [16]. In accordance, although we demonstrate here 
the efficacy of IIV vaccination during pregnancy against infant 
ALRI hospitalization, we did not observe a significant effect 
on medically attended outpatient visits at our study clinic [10]. 
Furthermore, a recent retrospective cohort study from Australia 
also described that influenza vaccination during pregnancy was 
associated with a 25% reduction (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.75 
[95% CI, .56–.99]) in hospitalizations for any acute respiratory 
illness in infants <6 months of age during influenza season [19]. 
Additionally, 3 other observational studies found that influenza 
vaccination during pregnancy was associated with a 48%–91% 
reduced risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations 
in infants <6 months of age [13, 15, 18].
The lack of tools to adequately investigate for bacterial pneu-
monia in infants and the fact that chest radiograph information 
was not available for this study to use as a proxy for bacterial 
pneumonia, albeit it being a more specific than sensitive marker 
for pneumococcal pneumonia, are limitations of our study [27]. 
Furthermore, not all infants were investigated for evidence of 
influenza virus infection at the time of hospitalization.
As influenza virus infection can be asymptomatic and the 
virus might be undetectable by the time the patient presents for 
care, even if the virus was part of the causal pathway of infec-
tion, we used the randomized placebo-controlled design of our 
trial as a vaccine probe to delineate the effect of maternal influ-
enza vaccination on all-cause ALRI hospitalization in infants 
[35]. This type of analysis helps to more comprehensively 
describe the disease burden than simple etiologic studies that 
may underestimate the real impact of influenza infection.
