Abstract
Objective
To examine whether investments made in public health research align with the health bur-
dens experienced by white and black Americans.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study of all deaths in the United States in 2015, we compared the dis-
tribution of potential years of life lost (PYLL) across 39 causes of death by race and identified
key differences. We examined the relationship between cause-of-death-specific PYLL and
key indicators of public health investment (federal funding and number of publications) by
race using linear spline models. We also compared the number of courses available at the
top schools of public health relevant to the top causes of death contributor to PYLL for black
and white Americans.
Results
Homicide was the number one contributor to PYLL among black Americans, while ischemic
heart disease was the number one contributor to PYLL among white Americans. Firearm-
related violence accounted for 88% of black PYLL attributed to homicide and 71% of white
PYLL attributed to homicide. Despite the high burden of PYLL, homicide research was the
focus of few federal grants or publications. In comparison, ischemic heart disease garnered
341 grants and 594 publications. The number of public health courses available relevant to
homicide (n = 9) was similar to those relevant to ischemic heart disease (n = 10).
Conclusions
Black Americans are disproportionately affected by homicide, compared to white Ameri-
cans. For both black and white Americans, the majority of PYLL due to homicide are fire-
arm-related. Yet, homicide research is dramatically underrepresented in public health
research investments in terms of grant funding and publications, despite available public

investments in public health resources threatens to perpetuate a system that disadvantages
black Americans.
Introduction
The goal of public health is to protect and promote the health of all people.[1] The existence of
persistent racial health disparities between black and white Americans is at stark odds with
this goal. Racial health disparities occur when the distribution of health conditions and health
outcomes is uneven by race, exemplified in the intractable life expectancy gap between black
and white Americans.[2] The Healthy People 2010 and 2020 initiatives,[3] designed to elimi-
nate health disparities in the US, have been largely ineffective in reducing racial disparities in
many areas like physical activity, substance abuse, and healthcare access.(4) Racial disparities
in areas like injury and violence have actually increased over time.[4] To reduce racial health
disparities and to improve the misalignment between public health goals and the reality of the
American public health landscape, it is critical to identify and address the underlying struc-
tural reasons that disadvantage black American’s health, as compared to white American’s
health.[5]
A key structural indicator of public health priorities is the investments we make in public
health research. Investments in public health research could contribute to racial health dispari-
ties if they systematically advantage or disadvantage certain racial groups. Public health
research creates the evidence base for effective health policy[6] and for medical breakthroughs
that can lead to rapid improvements in disease and injury treatment and prevention.[7–9]
However, not all health conditions are studied equally and conditions that represent larger
public health burdens tend to receive more attention. Further, external forces such as funding
opportunities and training experiences could direct the focus of public health research towards
or away from specific health conditions that may be disproportionately distributed across
racial groups. Recently the Black Lives Matters movement has advocated against institutional
racism that disadvantages black lives and health. Against that backdrop, several in the public
health community have questioned if our research and research applications protect the health
of all Americans equally.[10, 11]
In this analysis, we examine whether investments in public health research, in terms of fed-
eral grant funding and publications, accurately reflect the health issues of both black and white
Americans. We quantify the relative importance of different health issues with potential years
of life lost (PYLL), a measure that gives greater weight to the burden of premature deaths, and
examine how PYLL for a range of causes of death (COD) relate to investments in public health
research funding and publications.
Methods
We calculated PYLL for each US death in 2015, reported by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC).[12] Potential years of life lost (PYLL) measures the number of years a
person would have lived if they had not died of a particular cause.[13] PYLL is a useful tool for
comparing the burden of specific causes of death between groups, and highlights the burden
premature deaths—which often have the greatest impact on a community. There are many
measures that can be used to quantify the relative importance of different health outcomes (i.e.
PYLL, crude mortality, and cause-specific morbidity), each with its own advantages and

 disadvantages. We chose to focus our analysis on PYLL because of its emphasis on premature
death. In contrast, crude mortality rates are dominated by the health issues of the elderly with-
out penalty for lengthy lifespan before death. Morbidity measures like prevalence and inci-
dence do not take into account when death occurs in a person’s lifespan, making relative
comparisons between conditions difficult. We posit that PYLL is reasonable measure for this
paper’s focus because preventing premature death is a key public health goal with a direct
impact of extending life expectancy and it should play a major role in setting research
priorities.
PYLL was calculated for each death by subtracting the age at death from 75[13] and then
summed by black and white race separately for each of the 39 CODs, defined by ICD-10 codes.
[14] We present results for white and black racial categories inclusive of ethnic backgrounds,
as results from analyses restricting to non-Hispanic white and black categories revealed similar
findings. Eight ‘other’ causes of death were removed from some analyses to make comparisons
across specific CODs. Homicide-attributed PYLL were further categorized as firearm-related
or not. We compared the COD-specific PYLL for white and black Americans. To further
understand the disparities in premature death among black and white Americans, we also cal-
culated the average PYLL per death for each COD and the difference in average PYLL per
death by race. The differences in PYLL per death between black and white Americans were
ranked from highest to lowest.
To identify public health investments for each COD, we searched the Pubmed database to
identify the number of publications associated with each specific COD. We excluded eight
‘other’ categories for a total of 31 causes of death searched. We used the Advanced search func-
tion to build our search strings, including the MeSH term(s) associated with each cause of
death, a publication timeframe from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and a ‘United
States’ MeSH term for each search so that the search results reflected publications relevant to
US populations. The search string for homicide specifically excludes the MeSH term ‘Euthana-
sia.’ The MeSH terms we used for deaths due to ‘pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium’
were ‘maternal death’ OR ‘maternal mortality’. All search strings are recorded in S1 Table.
We also measured federal research funding investments by searching COD-specific key-
words in National Institutes of Health (NIH) RePORTER[15] for R01 grants funded in
2015. We excluded eight ‘other’ categories for a total of 31 causes of death searched. NIH
REPORTER is not cataloged according to MeSH terms, so we identified keywords to search
adapted from the MeSH terms we used in the Pubmed search or from the major components
of each category. We searched for all funded R01-level grants in the fiscal year 2015. We
attempted to exclude research on non-US study populations by including ‘US,’ ‘United States,’
or ‘American’ search terms. All search fields are recorded in S1 Table.
We assessed the relationship between COD-specific PYLL with public health investments
in federal research funding and publications by fitting linear regression models, coding PYLL
using linear splines with knots at tertiles determined by the overall contribution to PYLL made
by each COD. Graphical representations of these findings were stratified by race, plotting
(i) PYLL per COD by the number of publications per COD and (ii) PYLL per COD by the
number of R01s per COD. In these scatterplots, we compared the regression line predictions
from the linear spline model to reference lines illustrating a 1% increase in PYLL correspond-
ing to a 1% increase in publications and R01 grants.
To assess investments in the training of public health researchers, we also counted the num-
ber of public health courses that train new investigators to conduct research relevant to the top
contributors to PYLL for white Americans and black Americans from the five most highly
ranked American schools of public health.[16] Course catalogs from each school were
searched for key words associated with the cause of death. Courses were counted as related to

 ischemic heart disease (top contributor to PYLL among white Americans) if they included
‘ischemic heart disease,’ ‘myocardial ischemia’, ‘coronary heart disease’, or ‘coronary artery
disease’ in the course description. Courses were counted as related to gun violence/homicide
(top contributor to PYLL among black Americans) if they included ‘homicide,’ ‘gun violence,’
or ‘firearm,’ anywhere in the course description. All calculations and analyses were conducted
in SAS (v9.4). A copy of the SAS code used to produce the results of the analysis is included as
a supplemental file (S1 File). All mortality data used were de-identified and publically available
from the CDC. As such this analysis was deemed as non-human subjects research by the Indi-
ana University Office of Research Compliance (#1705637870).
Results
In 2015, there were 2,718,198 deaths in the US accounting for 21,396,995 total PYLL before the
age of 75 years (Table 1). Over three-quarters (76%) of PYLL were among white Americans.
Black Americans accounted for 20% of PYLL, despite representing only 13% of the 2015 popu-
lation.[17] The top PYLL contributor was ischemic heart disease (9%) for white Americans
and homicide (10%) for black Americans (Fig 1). Ischemic heart disease (IHD) was the second
leading cause of death among black Americans and homicide was the 12th leading cause of
PYLL (out of 31) for white Americans. Firearm-related violence accounted for 88% of PYLL
due to homicide in black Americans and 71% of PYLL due to homicide in white Americans.
Disparities existed in the number of PYLL per death between black Americans and white
Americans for all CODs, cause-specific (n = 30) and non-specific (n = 8), except sudden infan-
tile death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS only occurs in infants (age = 0 years), thus PYLL/death = 75
for both black and white infants (Table 1). The CODs that resulted in the largest disparities in
average age at death between black and white Americans were congenital and chromosomal
abnormalities, followed by suicide and homicide (Fig 2), both of which resulted in a greater
absolute number of deaths and PYLL than congenital and chromosomal abnormalities
(Table 1). The average black American dying from a congenital abnormality died at 15 years of
age, compared to the average white American who died at age 26 from a similar condition.
The average black American committing suicide was 10 years younger than the average white
American (38 years old versus 48 years old). Homicide, the leading contributor to PYLL
among black Americans, had the third highest racial disparity in average age at death (30 years
old in black Americans versus 37 years old in white Americans). IHD, the leading contributor
to PYLL among white Americans, ranked 17th in terms of racial disparity in average age at
death. Black Americans died on average 3 years earlier from IHD (average age at death 67
years), compared to white Americans (average age at death 70 years).
The relationship between COD-specific PYLL and number of publications differed by race
(Fig 3). Across the highest ranked CODs, the number of publications increased by 5 per
100,000 PYLL for white Americans, but decreased by 68 per 100,000 PYLL for black Ameri-
cans. This difference is driven largely by homicide, the highest contributor to black PYLL but
with few publications (n = 57). The highest contributor to white PYLL, IHD, garnered a large
number (n = 594) of publications.
A similar trend was observed between COD-specific PYLL and number of NIH R01 grants.
This disparity was again driven by homicides receiving few grants (n = 16) compared to IHD
(n = 341 grants). The relationships between PYLL and publications/grants were not sensitive
to the introduction of a one-year lag between deaths in 2014 and publications/funded grants
in 2015 (S1 Fig), nor were they sensitive to restriction of the population to non-Hispanic
ethnicity.

 While there were large disparities in the funded research and publications pertaining to
homicide and IHD, there were fewer apparent differences in the number of training opportu-
nities relevant to these top contributors of PYLL for black and white Americans, respectively.
Across the 41 departments in the top five schools of public health, nine courses mentioned
homicide, gun violence, or firearms in the course description. Ten courses mentioned ische-
mic heart disease in the course description (Table 2).
Discussion
In this study, we found that homicide was the largest contributor to black PYLL and the 12th
leading contributor to white PYLL. The majority of homicides for both black and white Amer-
icans were firearm-related. Racial disparities in average age at death were observed across all
39 COD assessed but were among the largest for homicide-related deaths. Despite the high
PYLL burden of homicide overall and the racial disparity observed, the number of publications
and federally funded grants for homicide research were among the lowest we assessed.
Our findings align with long-standing disparities in life expectancy between black and
white Americans.[2, 18] As far back as the 1980s, homicide has been noted as a major source
of the racial disparities in life expectancy.[18] Like homicide, suicide may also be firearm-
related. While suicides rates are lower among racial minorities, compared to white Americans,
[19, 20] our findings highlight that suicide is also an important cause of premature death
among black Americans. The gap in life expectancy between white and black Americans is
shrinking; however, it remains at 5.4 years for men and 3.8 years for women.[2] While there
are disparities between black and white Americans across all CODs, our results make clear
that public health efforts to reduce US life expectancy disparities must include homicide and
firearm research and prevention. This is supported by a recent study that suggests lack of fund-
ing for gun violence research relative to other causes of death.[21]
Lack of homicide research reflects the scarce federal funding for firearm violence research.
[21] In 1996, in response to a CDC-funded study demonstrating that having a gun in the
home increased the risk of homicide, pro-gun advocates successfully lobbied congress to
reduce the CDC budget by $2.6 million—the exact amount devoted for firearm research the
previous year.[22]. In 2012, this funding caveat was extended to the NIH, which continues to

 fund a small portfolio of firearm violence research. Congress further mandated that federal
funds to the CDC not “be used to advocate or promote gun control”.[23] Despite calls for
more firearm violence research funding, no specific funds have been appropriated by Congress
to the CDC.[22] The lack of funding is likely a major factor in why homicide and firearm vio-
lence have not been seen as major public health problems.
However, we did not find evidence to suggest homicide research is poorly represented in
public health coursework compared to ischemic heart disease, the top contributor to PYLL in
white Americans. Although courses were available relevant to homicide and firearm violence,

 these were primarily injury epidemiology courses with broad course descriptions that included
homicide or firearm violence but were not exclusively limited to the subject. A larger training
issue is that public health students, even those trained in injury epidemiology, likely get very
little hands-on experience with homicide or firearm research in mentored training environ-
ments given the limited amount of publications and R01 grants for homicide research we
observed. That said, across the US, there are a handful of leading programs that conduct fire-
arm-related violence research, including the Violence Prevention Research Program at
University of California, Davis, the Johns’ Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, and
the Harvard Injury Control Research Center, in addition to initiatives like ‘Cure Violence’
(University of Illinois, Chicago). These programs and initiatives are primarily funded by
foundations.
We chose PYLL as our key measure to identify the relative importance of causes of death; it
has both advantages and disadvantages relative to other measures. In terms of disadvantages,
PYLL does not capture morbidity, non-fatal injuries, or the value of lives lost after age 75.
Other measures such as disease incidence, prevalence, or cause-specific crude mortality rates
may well produce different patterns of results than we observed and should be evaluated in
future research. Indeed, in examining the cause-specific crude mortality rates in our study, we
find they differ from the top contributors to PYLL, and that the racial disparities are less appar-
ent. However, a key strength of PYLL compared to other measures is its focus on premature
death. Premature death, among its many negative consequences, exacts a toll of unreached
potential societal productivity. The more premature a death, the greater the loss in economic
productivity for the family, community, and society left behind.[24] For example, the esti-
mated value of remaining lifetime productivity for a 31 year old American (the average age at
homicide death for black Americans) is $1,521,239. In comparison, the estimated value of
remaining lifetime productivity for a 70 year old American (the average age at ischemic heart
disease death for white Americans) is $140,804.[24] Thus, in highlighting premature deaths,
PYLL calls attention to deaths with high societal and economic impact.
To capture key population-level trends, our analysis was conducted with some broad cate-
gorizations that merit more granular study in future research. First, the categorization of all
black Americans into one category does not recognize the diversity within this population nor
the differences that may exist between other races. Second, even though we examined the
number of IHD and homicide-related courses offered in the top schools of public health, we
did not measure the number of enrolled students or available faculty in these areas, which may
also be relevant measures of subject matter emphasis. Finally, important differences in homi-
cide PYLL may also exist by gender or socioeconomic status and race, unexamined here.

Do black lives matter in public health research and training?

 Homicide-related deaths in America constitute a public health crisis. Black Americans are
disproportionately affected by homicide and the majority of homicide PYLL for both black
and white Americans is attributed to firearm-related violence. In addition to lives lost, large
PYLL captures the loss of human potential that can push families into poverty and societies
toward heightened inequality. There is a pressing need to increase funding for homicide and
firearm research and to increase use of publicly available data to understand firearm-related
homicide and its downstream consequences. Along with more funding, we recommend
expanded training opportunities in homicide and firearm research to prepare the next genera-
tion of public health professionals to address this urgent public health need. Unless addressed,
the lack of funding and training for homicide research will perpetuate a system that specifically
disadvantages the health of black Americans.
