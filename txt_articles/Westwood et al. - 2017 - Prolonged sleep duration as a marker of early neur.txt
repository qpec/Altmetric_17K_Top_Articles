Prolonged sleep duration as a marker of
early neurodegeneration predicting
incident dementia
ABSTRACT
Objective: To evaluate the association between sleep duration and the risk of incident dementia
and brain aging.
Methods: Self-reported total hours of sleep were examined in the Framingham Heart Study (n 5
2,457, mean age 72 6 6 years, 57% women) as a 3-level variable: ,6 hours (short), 6–9 hours
(reference), and .9 hours (long), and was related to the risk of incident dementia over 10 years,
and cross-sectionally to total cerebral brain volume (TCBV) and cognitive performance.
Results: We observed 234 cases of all-cause dementia over 10 years of follow-up. In multivariable
analyses, prolonged sleep duration was associated with an increased risk of incident dementia
(hazard ratio [HR] 2.01; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24–3.26). These findings were driven
by persons with baseline mild cognitive impairment (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.06–7.55) and persons
without a high school degree (HR 6.05; 95% CI 3.00–12.18). Transitioning to sleeping .9 hours
over a mean period of 13 years before baseline was associated with an increased risk of all-cause
dementia (HR 2.43; 95% CI 1.44–4.11) and clinical Alzheimer disease (HR 2.20; 95% CI 1.17–
4.13). Relative to sleeping 6–9 hours, long sleep duration was also associated cross-sectionally
with smaller TCBV (b 6 SE, 21.08 6 0.41 mean units of TCBV difference) and poorer executive
function (b 6 SE, 20.41 6 0.13 SD units of Trail Making Test B minus A score difference).
Conclusions: Prolonged sleep duration may be a marker of early neurodegeneration and hence
a useful clinical tool to identify those at a higher risk of progressing to clinical dementia within
10 years. Neurology® 2017;88:1172–1179

A small number of studies have reported associations between both long1,2 and short2 self-
reported sleep duration and an increased risk of incident dementia. However, it is unclear
whether abnormal sleep duration serves as a risk factor for or an early marker of neurodegenera-
tion. Sleep may provide a restorative function, removing metabolic waste from the brain and
preventing the accumulation of b-amyloid,3 a hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). On the other
hand, sleep disorders may also emerge as a result of atrophy to brain regions involved in sleep
and wakefulness4 or as a consequence of mood disturbances,5,6 which are common in dementia.
The aim of the current study was to examine if long (.9 hours) or short (,6 hours) self-
reported sleep duration was associated with the risk of incident all-cause dementia or incident
AD dementia. We also examined the association of sleep duration with brain volume on MRI
and cognitive ability. Using serial assessments of self-reported sleep duration, a mean of 13 years
apart, we examined whether sleep duration was likely to be a risk factor for or an early biological
marker of dementia.

 METHODS Sample. The Framingham Heart Study (FHS)
involves a series of ongoing community-based prospective
cohort studies conducted in Framingham, Massachusetts. The
study commenced in 1948 with the enrollment of 5,209
original
cohort
participants
who
have
been
examined
approximately every 2 years. Recruitment and characterization
of the original cohort have been described previously.7 Between
1971 and 1975, the offspring of the original cohort and their
spouses were enrolled into an offspring cohort.8 Participants of
the offspring cohort have been assessed approximately once every
4 years with the most recent examination concluding in 2014.
We used the 20th original cohort examination (1986–
1990) and the 7th offspring examination (1998–2001) as a base-
line from which we examined the risks of incident all-cause
dementia and clinical AD over 10 years. We also examined
neuropsychological performance and brain volume on MRI
using cross-sectional data in offspring study participants. The
study design is summarized in figure 1 (see figure e-1 at
Neurology.org for detailed information about the selection of
study participants). For the analysis of incident dementia, we
excluded persons younger than 60 years at baseline, persons
with prevalent dementia at baseline, and persons without
follow-up for dementia. For the analysis of neuropsychological
function and brain volume, we excluded persons with prevalent
stroke or dementia at the time of outcome assessment but did
not restrict the analysis to a certain age group.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. All participants provided written informed consent
and the study was approved by the institutional review board
and Boston University Medical Center.
Self-reported total sleep time. Self-reported sleep duration
was obtained as part of the Physical Activity Index (PAI)
questionnaire. Participants responded to the question “How
many hours do you typically sleep?” Responses were recorded
to the nearest integer. Participants of the original cohort com-
pleted the questionnaire at examinations 12 (1971–1974) and 20
(1986–1990) whereas offspring cohort participants completed
the questionnaire at examinations 4 (1987–1991) and 7
(1998–2001). We examined sleep duration at baseline using
the most current administration of the PAI, former sleep duration
using the first administration of the PAI, and change in sleep
duration by comparing the 2 time points. Former sleep was only
examined in the sample of participants with available baseline
sleep data.
Outcomes: Incident dementia. Participants in the FHS are
under continued surveillance for incident dementia (see
appendix e-1 for details). A diagnosis of dementia was made
in accordance with the DSM-IV, and a diagnosis of clinical
AD based on the National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s
Disease and Related Disorders Association for definite,
probable, or possible AD.9
Outcomes: Total cerebral brain volume on MRI. We used
MRI to measure total cerebral brain volume (TCBV), defined as
the ratio of total brain parenchymal volume above the tentorium
to total intracranial volume, which therefore adjusted for head
size. Since intracranial volume reflects the largest brain size
achieved during life, TCBV provides a proxy for global brain atro-
phy. MRIs were obtained with a Siemens (Munich, Germany)
Magnetom 1T or 1.5T field strength machine using a T2-
weighted double spin-echo coronal imaging sequence of 4-mm
contiguous
slices
from
nasion
to
occiput.
The
imaging
parameters, measurement protocols, and reproducibility of
these measurements have been described previously.10
Figure 1
Overview of the study design
For the analysis of incident dementia, both the original and offspring study participants were studied together. Sleep was related to cross-sectional cogni-
tive performance and brain MRI in the offspring cohort only. After exclusion of persons with missing covariates, the final analysis sample was 2,457 for
analysis of incident dementia. Sample sizes depict data for sleep duration measured at baseline. AD 5 Alzheimer disease.

 Outcomes: Neuropsychological function. Trail Making
Test A and B and Logical Memory Delayed from the Wechsler
Memory Scales were completed as part of a neuropsychological
test battery administered by trained research assistants and neuro-
psychologists. As is common practice, we subtracted the Trails A
from the Trails B score to derive Trails B–A, an outcome reflect-
ing executive function and processing speed. Logical Memory was
included as a measure of verbal recall memory. Consistent with
our previous publications, Trail Making Test scores were log
transformed and standardized, and directionality was reversed
such that higher scores reflect superior performance.11
Statistical analyses. All analyses were conducted in SAS (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Cox regression models were used to relate
self-reported sleep duration to the incidence of dementia and
AD whereas linear regressions were used to examine the
associations of sleep duration with TCBV and cognitive scores.
Sleep duration was examined as a 3-level variable: ,6 hours
(short sleep duration), 6–9 hours (reference), and .9 hours
(long sleep duration) and related to all outcome measures.
However, for incident dementia, we observed a threshold effect
of sleeping #9 hours vs sleeping .9 hours. Thus, we modeled
sleep as a dichotomous variable (#9 hours vs .9 hours) in
further models involving incident dementia but as a 3-level
variable for models involving TCBV and cognitive scores.
Change in sleep duration between the 2 assessments of the PAI
was examined by grouping participants in 1 of the following 4
categories: sleep duration #9 hours at both former sleep and
baseline sleep time points (reference), sleep duration .9 hours
at both former sleep and baseline sleep time points, change from
#9 hours (former sleep) to .9 hours (baseline sleep), and change
from .9 hours (former sleep) to #9 hours (baseline sleep).

and

confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical models involving incident
dementia were adjusted for age, sex, education, homocysteine,
and the presence of an APOE e4 allele. These covariates were
chosen because they are among the strongest predictors of
dementia in our sample.12,13 Statistical models for TCBV and
cognition included an additional adjustment for the time delay
between the measurement of sleep duration and the outcome and
age squared in the case of TCBV (given that associations between
age and TCBV are nonlinear).10
Interactions and sensitivity analysis. For the outcome of all-
cause dementia, we explored for interactions with potential effect-
modifying variables such as education (no high school degree vs at
least a high school degree), age, sex, and APOE e4 allele status.
We then performed a sensitivity analysis, stratifying results
according to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) status at
baseline, using the criteria defined by Petersen et al.14 The aim
of this sensitivity analysis was to examine whether sleep duration
was likely to be a risk factor for dementia in those without MCI or
whether sleep duration was likely to be an early marker of
neurodegeneration in those with MCI. Results were considered
significant if p , 0.05, except tests of interaction, which were
considered statistically significant if p , 0.10.
RESULTS Baseline characteristics are displayed in
table 1. There were 234 (10%) cases of all-cause
dementia,
181
(8%)
of
which
were
clinically
consistent with AD. The mean TCBV value was
79% (SD 3), the mean Trail Making Test B–A
score was 51 seconds (SD 52), and the mean
number of words correctly recalled for Logical
Memory Delayed was 11 (SD 4).
Sleep duration, incident dementia, and brain aging.
When directly comparing those sleeping .9 hours
to the remainder of the sample, long sleep duration
was a significant predictor of all-cause dementia (table
2, figure 2). There was a statistical trend observed
between long sleep duration and an increased risk
of AD (p 5 0.05). Whereas former sleep duration
was not associated with the risk of dementia, those
who transitioned to sleeping .9 hours (from former
to baseline time points) were at an increased risk of
all-cause dementia. A statistical trend also suggested
a possible association between transitioning to
sleeping .9 hours and an increased risk of AD.

 Both short (b 6 SE, 20.22 6 0.10 SD unit score
difference; p 5 0.03) and long (b 6 SE, 20.41 6
0.13 SD unit score difference; p 5 0.001) sleep dura-
tion were associated cross-sectionally with poorer per-
formance on Trail Making Test B–A (6–9 hours of
sleep used as the reference; p for trend, ,0.0001).
Long sleep duration was associated cross-sectionally
with smaller TCBV (b 6 SE, 21.08 6 0.41 mean
units of TCBV difference; p 5 0.009), whereas short
sleep duration was associated with larger TCBV (b 6
SE, 1.10 6 0.31 mean units of TCBV difference;
p 5 0.0003; 6–9 hours of sleep used as the reference;
p for trend, ,0.0001). We regressed TCBV and Trail
Making Test scores on age and compared differences
in means attributable to sleeping .9 hours (vs 6–9
hours). The difference in Trail Making Test B–A
scores and TCBV associated with sleeping .9 hours
(vs 6–9 hours) was equivalent to approximately 12
and 5 years of brain aging, respectively. These esti-
mates are intended to provide some clinical context
but are based on small numbers and are not intended
to be precise. There were no associations between
sleep duration and Logical Memory performance (p
for trend 5 0.61).
Interactions. In our model predicting incident all-
cause dementia, we observed an interaction between
baseline sleep duration and education (p 5 0.003).
Specifically, among participants without a high
school degree (table e-1 and figure 2), sleeping .9
hours at baseline was associated with approximately
a 600% increase in the risk of both incident all-cause
dementia (HR 6.05; 95% CI 3.00–12.18) and AD
(HR
6.00;
95%
CI
2.73–13.16).
No
other
interactions were observed.
Sensitivity analysis. Long sleep duration at baseline was
only associated with an increased risk of all-cause
dementia in those with MCI (n 5 60; table 3). In
contrast, transitioning to becoming a long sleeper was
associated with incident all-cause dementia in both
those with and without MCI at baseline, although the
effect was more pronounced in those with MCI. In
post hoc analysis, we included additional adjustments
for
medical
comorbidities,
including
prevalent
cardiovascular disease (comprising coronary heart
disease, congestive heart failure, or stroke), prevalent
diabetes, prevalent atrial fibrillation, and depression
(available as an adjustment only for brain volumes
and neuropsychological outcomes). The additional
adjustments did not change the observed pattern of
results (tables e-2 and e-3).
DISCUSSION In this large community-based study

 less at baseline had a higher risk of incident all-cause
dementia. Persons reporting sleeping more than 9
hours compared to 6–9 hours also displayed lower
cross-sectional brain volume and poorer cross-
sectional processing speed and executive function.
Associations between long sleep duration at baseline
and dementia were driven by persons with MCI and
persons without a high school degree. Whereas long
sleep duration in the past was not associated with
dementia risk, transitioning to .9 hours of sleep
over a mean period of 13 years leading up to
baseline was associated with an increased risk of
dementia across the whole sample. Collectively,
these results suggest that long sleep duration serves
as an early biological marker of neurodegeneration,
especially in those with low educational attainment.
The association between sleep duration and inci-
dent dementia has not been well-studied. Sleep dura-
tion as measured using polysomnography was not
associated with the risks of MCI or dementia in a pro-
spective study of 298 women followed for a median of
4.7 years.15 Consistent with the present results, the
Neurological Disorders in Central Spain Study
showed that those who slept 9 or more hours dis-
played a greater than 2-fold risk of incident demen-
tia.1 In this previous study, short sleep duration was
not associated with the risk of dementia in the fully
adjusted statistical model. However, follow-up for
dementia was limited to a mean of 3.2 years, meaning
that results may have been driven by reverse causality.
Researchers using the Survey on Elders’ Health
showed that sleep duration $9 hours was associated
with incident amnestic cognitive impairment over 1
year in women.16 However, some participants may
have already had cognitive impairment at baseline
given that participants were eligible for inclusion with
Mini-Mental State Examination scores as low as 22 at
baseline. More recently, the Women’s Health Initia-
tive observed a V-shaped curve, with persons having
,6 hours or .8 hours of sleep showing an increased
risk of dementia/MCI as a combined outcome.2
While some studies demonstrate an association
between long sleep duration and dementia, the tem-
poral association between the 2 events was in need

 of further clarification. We extend previous findings
by demonstrating that transitioning from sleeping
#9 hours to more than .9 hours, over a mean period
of 13 years, was associated with a higher risk of inci-
dent dementia. In our study, long sleep duration in
the past was not associated with an increased risk of
dementia and sleep duration at baseline was only
associated with the risks of dementia in those with
MCI. Collectively, our findings suggest that transi-
tioning to being a long sleeper is an early marker of
neurodegeneration. Thus, interventions to reduce
sleep duration in long sleepers are unlikely to mitigate
clinical dementia risk.
The cross-sectional association between short
sleep duration and poorer cognition was expected
given that performance on the Trail Making Test
is dependent on
cognitive processes, such as
attention, which are impaired under conditions of
sleep deprivation.17,18 Thus, the mechanisms linking
short sleep duration to poorer cognitive function
may be independent of any neurodegenerative dis-
ease. In support of the present findings, other studies
have shown that prolonged sleep is associated with
poorer cognitive function.19,20 Associations between
prolonged sleep duration and poorer cognition may
be driven by early neurodegeneration, a finding sup-
ported by the fact that long sleep duration was also
cross-sectionally associated with smaller TCBV in
the present study, a proxy for global brain atrophy.
The association between short sleep duration and
larger TCBV was surprising, and the underlying
mechanisms are unclear. A previous study demon-
strated that each hour of reduced sleep duration was
associated

Mechanisms underpinning prolonged sleep in
early dementia may extend to neurodegenerative
changes in brain regions involved in the regulation
of sleep and wakefulness including the projections
between the suprachiasmatic nucleus, pineal gland,
and retina.22 This may lead to circadian dysfunction,
misalignment, and the altered production and secre-
tion of melatonin.22,23 Levels of the wake-promoting
neuropeptide hypocretin-1 have also been reported to
be reduced in AD, as are the levels of hypocretin-1
neurons.24 Sleep duration may also be indirectly
linked to dementia. For example, psychiatric comor-
bidities such as anxiety and depression are common in
dementia and are associated with sleep disturbances,
as are the medications used to treat these disorders.5,6
Whereas excessive sleep duration appeared to be
a marker for early neurodegeneration in the present
study, other facets of sleep may predispose to the
pathology of AD and dementia. For example, current
interest surrounds the role of sleep in the clearance of
metabolic waste from the brain. Forcing sleep depri-
vation upon mice predisposed to dementia exacer-
bates the accumulation of Ab25,26 and p-tau26 and
overnight sleep in humans has been shown to reduce
Ab levels in CSF.27 Using polysomnography to exam-
ine sleep objectively, Yaffe et al.15 demonstrated that
sleep-disordered breathing was associated with a high-
er risk of developing MCI or dementia. Thus, even if
long sleep duration is a marker for early neurodegen-
eration, sleep pathologies or specific aspects of sleep
architecture may contribute differently to the risk of
dementia.
The present study is not without limitations.
Our sensitivity analysis stratified results by MCI
status at baseline. However, we cannot exclude
the possibility that persons without MCI may have
had subclinical disease below the threshold for
MCI. As we did not correct for multiple compari-
sons, we cannot exclude the possibility that some
of the reported results are attributable to chance.
Our study relied on self-report to estimate total
sleep duration. Although self-reported sleep has
been shown to reflect objective assessments of sleep
accurately,28 reporting may be influenced by recall
bias. Moreover, time in bed may not always accu-
rately reflect total sleep time, and our study does
not differentiate between overnight sleep duration
and time spent napping throughout the day.
Moreover, we are unable to determine the biology
underlying long sleep duration. The use of poly-
somnography would help clarify whether long sleep
duration was associated with sleep fragmentation,
including sleep efficiency, prolonged sleep latency,
or frequent nocturnal arousals.
The advantage of using self-report to estimate
sleep time is that the information is easy to collect,
increasing the applicability of our results to general
practice. Patients reporting long sleep duration and
cognitive complaints to their primary care provider
could be triaged for further dementia screening, with-
out the need for overnight sleep studies. As our find-
ings were driven by those with low educational
attainment, we identified a rather select subgroup that
may warrant further screening for dementia. Thus,
self-reported sleep duration may be a useful clinical
tool to help predict persons at risk of progressing to
clinical dementia within 10 years. Our results also
suggest a possible role for cognitive reserve, with high-
er educational attainment potentially protecting
against clinical dementia in the presence of long sleep
duration.
