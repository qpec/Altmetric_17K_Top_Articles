AbstrACt
Objectives Chondroitin sulfate 800 mg/day 
(CS) pharmaceutical-grade in the management of 
symptomatic knee osteoarthritis consistent with the 
European Medicines Agency guideline.
Methods A prospective, randomised, 6-month, 3-arm, 
double-blind, double-dummy, placebo and celecoxib 
(200 mg/day)-controlled trial assessing changes in pain 
on a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and in the Lequesne 
Index (LI) as coprimary endpoints. Minimal-Clinically 
Important Improvement (MCII), patient-Acceptable 
Symptoms State (pASS) were used as secondary 
endpoints.
results 604 patients (knee osteoarthritis) diagnosed 
according to American College of rheumalogy (ACr) 
criteria, recruited in five European countries and followed 
for 182 days. CS and celecoxib showed a greater 
significant reduction in pain and LI than placebo. In 
the intention-to-treat (Itt) population, pain reduction 
in VAS at day 182 in the CS group (−42.6 mm) and in 
celecoxib group (−39.5 mm) was significantly greater 
than the placebo group (−33.3 mm) (p=0.001 for CS 
and p=0.009 for celecoxib), while no difference observed 
between CS and celecoxib. Similar trend for the LI, as 
reduction in this metric in the CS group (−4.7) and 
celecoxib group (−4.6) was significantly greater than the 
placebo group (−3.7) (p=0.023 for CS and p=0.015 for 
celecoxib), no difference was observed between CS and 
celecoxib. Both secondary endpoints (MCII and pASS) at 
day 182 improved significantly in the CS and celecoxib 
groups. All treatments demonstrated excellent safety 
profiles.
Conclusion A 800 mg/day pharmaceutical-grade 
CS is superior to placebo and similar to celecoxib in 
reducing pain and improving function over 6 months 
in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (oA) patients. this 
formulation of CS should be considered a first-line 
treatment in the medical management of knee oA.
IntrOduCtIOn
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most prevalent muscu-
loskeletal disease affecting humans, an important 
cause of pain, loss of function, disability and a 
major public health problem1 2 that is associated 
with a substantial and ever increasing burden on 
society.3 4 OA of the knee and hip tends to generate 
the greatest impact on the population, as pain and 
stiffness in these large weight-bearing joints often 
lead to the need for medical intervention.2 Medical 
management of knee OA includes both pharma-
cological and non-pharmacological modalities 
and numerous scientific societies have produced 
recommendations for the non-surgical management 
of knee OA.5–9 Although several differences are 
observed between these evidence-based guidelines, 
mostly reflecting heterogeneity of the expert panels 
involved, geographical differences in the availability 
of chemical entities 10 11 there was, until recently, a 
general consensus that analgesics, including parac-
etamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) have demonstrated a positive benefit-risk 
profile when used to treat symptoms of knee OA.5–11 
However, recent publications have aggressively 
challenged the use of paracetamol for the treatment 
of symptomatic OA because of a lack of efficacy 
and a considerable degree of toxicity, especially at 
the upper end of the standard analgesic dose.12–14 
Similarly, safety profiles of oral NSAIDs remain 
a concern and caution is recommended before 
selecting the preparation and dose for a patient.14 
Therefore, recent guidelines recommend mainte-
nance therapy to be conducted with symptomatic 
slow-acting drugs for OA (SYSADOAs), a class of 
drugs that is recognised to offer a high degree of 
safety and tolerability.5 Although discrepancies 
can be found in the literature regarding recom-
mendations on SYSADOAs in the management of 
knee OA,10 11 higher quality evidence seems to be 
provided for patented, prescription formulations 
of chondroitin sulfate (CS) and crystalline glucos-
amine sulfate (GS).9
Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is a sulfated glycosami-
noglycan composed of chains of alternating D-glu-
curonic acid and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine.15 CS 
is available as pharmaceutical-grade and nutraceu-
tical-grade products, the latter exhibiting striking 
variations in preparation, composition, purity 
as well as clinical effects. These differences may 
explain why, whereas pharmaceutical-grade CS 
(ie, the 4&6isomer of sodium CS) was shown to 
improve pain and function and/or delay structural 
progression of knee OA in several well-conducted 
studies,16–18 these results were not confirmed 
when lower grade formulations were used.19 20 
Indeed, a recent systematic review conducted by 
the Cochrane Collaborative Group concludes that 
CS, alone or in combination with GS, is better than 
placebo in improving pain in participants with OA 
in short-term studies, with CS having a lower risk 
of serious adverse events compared with controls.21

Clinical and epidemiological research
Another potential source of inconsistency in the results from 
previous studies of SYSADOAs in knee OA has been idiosyn-
cratic trial design. For this reason, the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) produced a Guideline on Clinical Investigation 
of Medicinal Products Used in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis 
(CPMP/EWP/784/97 Rev. 1), guideline which has been recently 
supported by a European experts consensus.22 It recommends 
that efficacy of chemical entities used in the treatment of symp-
tomatic OA be tested according to a standard study design with 
the following basic parameters: a minimum 6-month study dura-
tion; a three-arm study design including a placebo and an active 
comparator (ie, oral NSAID); and two co-primary endpoints 
evaluating pain and function, respectively.
Herein, we report results from a study of pharmaceuti-
cal-grade CS in patients with symptomatic knee OA, which, to 
our knowledge, is the first ever to have been conducted in full 
accordance with the aforementioned EMA guideline.
MAterIAl And MethOds
study design and selection of patients
The study comprised patients from Belgium, Czech Republic, 
Italy, Poland and Switzerland, who were enrolled between June 
2014 and October 2015. The main inclusion criteria were outpa-
tients status, age above 50 years and primary knee OA of the 
medial or lateral femorotibial compartment diagnosed according 
to the clinical and radiographic criteria of the American College 
of Rheumatology (ACR).23 The more symptomatic knee (with 
a pain score of at least 50 
mm on a 0–100 
mm Visual Analogue 
Scale (VAS) for at least 3 months before enrolment) was defined 
as the target knee. The main exclusion criteria were those listed 
in the last version of the Guideline on Clinical Investigation 
of Medicinal Products used in the Treatment of Osteoarthritis 
released by the EMA in 2010 (CPMP/EWP/784/97 Rev. 1) and 
grade 4 radiographic OA according to the Kellgren-Lawrence 
(K-L) grading system.24 Use of any intra-articular injection in the 
target knee in the last 6 months, SYSADOAs in the last 3 months, 
NSAIDs in the last 5 days and paracetamol in the 10 
hours 
preceding enrollment was also specifically forbidden by the study 
protocol. There were two co-primary endpoints, predefined as 
stipulated by the EMA guidelines: pain and Lequesne Index (LI) 
assessment. Ethics Committee approval from all participating 
centres was obtained and all patients gave their written informed 
consent to participate.
This study has been designed to assess the symptomatic effect 
of CS. Bone and cartilage markers were not the target in this 
short study.
treAtMent AssIgnMent
Patients were randomly assigned to one of the following three 
groups: (1) Group CS: one tablet of CS 800 
mg and one capsule 
of placebo celecoxib; (2) Group celecoxib: one tablet of placebo 
CS and one capsule of celecoxib 200 
mg (Celebrex Pfizer); (3) 
Group placebo: one tablet of placebo CS and one capsule of 
placebo celecoxib. The tablets of Celebrex available on the 
market were encapsulated to allow for a double-blind, double-
dummy design. CS tablets contained highly purified chondroitin 
4 & 6 sulfate in a concentration not less than 95% (European 
patents E 1582214 and EP 1705192) (Condrosulf (other brand 
name: Chondrosulf, Condral) 800; IBSA Institut Biochimique 
SA; Pambio-Noranco, Switzerland). All treatments were taken 
once daily, every evening with a glass of water, for 6 months. 
For rescue analgesia, patients were allowed to take paracetamol 
500 
mg tablets (maximum dosage 3 g/day), and they recorded 
use thereof in a diary. An appropriate washout period of 10 
hours 
was required before symptom assessment at in-clinic visits. No 
other pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for 
OA were allowed. Compliance with the study treatments was 
established by asking the patients about missing doses and by 
counting unused study drugs.
OutCOMe MeAsures
There were two co-primary endpoints, as stipulated by the 
EMA guideline, and both were assessed as the change from 
baseline, that is, the difference between enrollment and study 
conclusion. One endpoint was the patient’s estimate of pain on 
a 100 
mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The other endpoint was 
the Lequesne Index (LI), which integrates pain and function and 
results in a score from 0 to 24.25 Secondary endpoints included 
the proportion of patients reaching the Minimal-Clinically 
Important Improvement (MCII), defined as the smallest change 
in measurement that signifies an important improvement in a 
patient’s symptom,26 and the Patient Acceptable Symptom State 
(PASS), defined as the value of symptoms beyond which patients 
consider themselves well.27 Patient and investigator global 
assessment were scored on a 5-point Likert ordinal scale (excel-
lent, good, fair, poor, none). All adverse events and abnormal 
laboratory test results were recorded.
stAtIstICAl AnAlysIs
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS Software (V
. 9.4 
and V
. 8.2) on a Windows 7 operating system.
We calculated a sample size of 600 patients based on an 
estimated difference of 9 
mm between CS and placebo after 6 
months of treatment, with a standard deviation (SD) of 25 
mm, 
a power of 90%, an alpha risk of 5% and a drop-out rate of 
15%. The intention-to-treat (ITT) population was defined as all 
randomised patients who received one dose of the study medica-
tion. Safety analyses were conducted on all randomised patients.
VAS (pain in mm) and LI score from D1 to D182 were 
compared between the three treatment groups by means of a 
linear mixed model carried out by using the SAS MIXED proce-
dure, with patient as random effect, centre, treatment group, 
time point, interaction between treatment group and time point 
as categorical covariates (interaction between treatment group 
and centre excluded from the final models because not statis-
tically significant. p=0.101 
for VAS mixed model, p=0.998 
for 
LI mixed model). No missing values replacement (LOCF, last 
observation carried forward or BOCF, basal observation carried 
forward) was performed for this analysis. The proportion of 
patients reaching the MCII, the PASS and the Outcome Measures 
in Rheumatology (OMERACT-OARSI) criteria were compared 
using a Chi-square (χ2)) test. Patient’s and investigator’s global 
assessments were analysed by means of Mantel-Haenszel χ2 
test. Differences between groups in rates of patients with treat-
ment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), serious adverse events 
(SAEs), adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and study withdrawals 
due to AEs were assessed using the χ2 test.
results
Of 656 patients screened, 604 were randomised and 603 
considered eligible for ITT analysis (all patients who received 
the study medication). Of these patients, 199 received CS, 
199 received celecoxib and 205 received placebo. The cumu-
lative time distribution of withdrawals was similar in the three 
groups without significant differences in reasons for withdrawals 
(figure 1). Patients in the three groups had similar demographic

and baseline characteristics (table 1). Grades 1 to 3 of K-L were 
equally distributed between the three groups, with roughly 50% 
of the patients presenting a grade 2 OA and 25% corresponding 
to either a grade 1 or a grade 3 overall.
Analysis of pain scores in ITT revealed a significant improve-
ment in all three groups compared with baseline at day 30, 91 
and 182 (all p<0.001) (figure 2). Both the CS and the celecoxib 
group showed a statistically greater reduction in pain compared 
with the placebo group (p=0.001 
for CS and p=0.009 
for cele-
coxib, table 2) after 6 months without any significant difference 
between the two active groups (p=0.446).
Analysis of LI scores in ITT revealed a significant ameliora-
tion in all three groups compared with baseline at day 30, 91 
and 182 (all p<0.001) (figure 3). At day 91 and 182, both CS 
and celecoxib induced a significantly greater reduction in LI than 
placebo (p=0.050 
for CS and p=0.027 
for celecoxib at day 91, 
p=0.023 
for CS and p=0.015 
for celecoxib at day 182) while no 
difference was observed between CS and celecoxib (p=0.799 
at 
day 91 and p=0.890 
at day 182, table 2). The decrease in LI 
observed in the celecoxib group attained statistical significance 
in comparison to the placebo group at day 30 (p=0.045), while 
it took the CS group until day 91 (p=0.050) (figure 3).
After 6 months, a greater proportion of patients reached the 
MCII (20 
mm of VAS reduction) in the CS (68%) and celecoxib 
(69%) groups than in the placebo group (61%). This difference 
was not significant for the CS–placebo comparison (p=0.122), 
for the celecoxib–placebo comparison (p=0.098) and not signifi-
cant for CS–celecoxib comparison (p=0.914). Similar results were 
obtained for the proportion of patients reaching the PASS in the CS 
(57%), celecoxib (59%) and placebo (49%) groups. The PASS data 
were significant for the celecoxib–placebo comparison (p=0.047), 
not significant for the CS–placebo comparison (p=0.130) and not 
significant for the CS–celecoxib comparison (p=0.611).
Significant results were observed when defining responders 
patients with at least 40% or 50% of improvement in pain or LI 
scores, and when patients were classified according to OMER-
ACT-OARSI (scenario F). CS and celecoxib provided signifi-
cantly higher number of responders than placebo and no differ-
ence was observed between CS and celecoxib (table 3).
At study conclusion (day 182), significantly more patients and 
more investigators scored the global assessment as excellent or 
good in the CS and celecoxib groups compared with the placebo 
(p=0.027 
for CS, p=0.013 
for celecoxib), while there was no 
difference between the two active groups (p=0.774). Study 
medication usage was 
>95% 
in all groups, demonstrating excel-
lent compliance and the absence of intergroup differences.
Finally, there was no significant difference between CS, cele-
coxib or placebo usage in the rate of TEAEs, SAEs, ADRs and 
withdrawal related to TEAEs. Abdominal pain/discomfort was 
the most frequently reported ADR (2.5% in the CS group, 4.5% 
in the celecoxib group and 2.9% in the placebo group). Routine 
laboratory testing identified one case of leukopenia and one case 
of thrombocytopenia in the placebo group, but no significant 
abnormalities in the CS or celecoxib groups.

therapeutic benefit of SYSADOAs in a knee OA clinical trial that 
is fully aligned with the current EMA guideline. We demon-
strated that CS is superior to placebo and similar to celecoxib 
across multiple outcome measures, including reduction in pain 
and LI (co-primary endpoints), as well as in the proportion of 
patients experiencing MCII (secondary endpoint) and patient/
investigator global assessments.
Prior to CONCEPT, the only study that assessed the impact 
of a SYSADOA on knee OA in a three-arm design was the 
Glucosamine Unum-in-Die Efficacy (GUIDE) study, a study that 
demonstrated that patented crystalline glucosamine sulfate (GS) 
was superior to placebo and equivalent to acetaminophen in 
reducing LI after 6 months of treatment.28 However, the present 
study utilised celecoxib as an active comparator, a NSAID that 
was recently shown to provide substantially greater clinical effect 
than acetaminophen in knee OA.12 14
All treatments, including placebo, provided a statistically signif-
icant improvement from baseline on pain and function as early as 
day 30, and this effect persisted until the end of the trial. This is not 
surprising as a substantial placebo effect was previously reported in 
trials assessing drugs in OA.29 30 However, both active groups (CS 
and celecoxib) provided a significantly greater reduction in pain 
(VAS) and a better improvement in function (LI) than the placebo, 
after 6 months and 3 months, respectively. With respect to LI, it is 
interesting to note that celecoxib treatment resulted in a statisti-
cally significant change at day 30 compared with placebo, while CS 
did not. Although impossible to know definitively, this observation 
may be related to an intrinsic difference in the mechanism of action 
of the two molecules.
One important consideration in any clinical investigation that 
uses a pain assessment is how to equate statistical significance 
with clinical benefit. Indeed, the relevance of statistically signif-
icant CS-dependent improvements in OA symptoms in previous 
trials16–18 has been challenged.21 The EMA 2010 guideline docu-
ment suggests that the improvement in pain observed with the

test article must be clinically relevant, but unfortunately the 
guideline does not provide an associated numerical threshold. 
However, a group of European academic scientists and regula-
tors recently published an expert consensus statement in which 
they suggest that at least a 5 
mm difference on a 100 
mm VAS 
between the placebo and active groups constitutes a clinically 
relevant threshold for a SYSADOAs.22 These recommendations 
were partially based on the observation that most clinical trials 
published with SYSADOAs in knee or hip OA show symptomatic 
improvements in the 5–6 
mm range on a 100 
mm VAS.31–33 In our 
study, the difference in pain reduction between CS and placebo 
is 8.2 
mm after 6 months in the ITT analysis. This difference 
exceeds this range and compares favourably with the previous 
publications reporting beneficial effects of SYSADOAs in knee 
or hip OA.31–33
The improvement in pain and function observed in the CS group 
corresponds to an effect size (ES) of 0.35 for pain and 0.27 for LI, 
whereas the ES in the celecoxib group was 0.27 for pain and 0.30 
for LI. ES 
≤0.2 
is usually considered as small while ES between 0.2 
and 0.5 is defined as medium. An ES value of 0.27 for pain in 
the celecoxib group is consistent with previous publications8 14 and 
provides thus external validation of CONCEPT trial data. For CS, 
an ES of 0.35 for pain is consistent with values previously reported 
for pharmaceutical-grade GS or CS,8 9 compares well with the 
reported ES for most NSAIDs8 14 and is two-fold higher than the 
ES (0.14) commonly reported for acetaminophen in knee OA.8 13
Although both acetaminophen and NSAIDs have been shown to 
be efficacious in the setting of knee OA, the chronic use of these 
medicines is known to be associated with frequent and serious 
adverse events.13 14 It is notable in this regard, that CS, in addi-
tion to a robust efficacy profile that is comparable to NSAIDs, also 
exhibits a safety profile that was similar to placebo in this study 
and in others.5 8 16 17 21 This combination of therapeutic effect and 
well-documented safety and tolerability explain why recent guide-
lines8 9 recommend SYSADOAs, including pharmaceutical-grade 
CS, as a first-line treatment in the management of knee OA.

Clinical and epidemiological research
In addition to the classic efficacy parameters, pain and 
LI, regulatory and clinical guidelines continue to place addi-
tional emphasis on patient’s perception of their clinical status, 
thus requiring the use of additional measures to assess treat-
ment outcome. The significantly higher proportion of patients 
reaching the self-assessed MCII and the significantly greater 
number of patients ranking their treatment as good or excellent, 
compared with the placebo group, further reflects the impor-
tance of clinical benefits obtained with CS usage.
In conclusion, the CONCEPT study provided evidence that 
daily administration of 800 
mg of 4 &6 CS in patients with 
symptomatic knee OA lead to improvement in pain and func-
tion superior to placebo and similar to the NSAID celecoxib. In 
addition, we confirmed the excellent safety profile of CS that 
has been previously observed by others. This compelling bene-
fit-risk profile, in light of the known clinical risks associated 
with chronic usage of NSAIDs and paracetamol, underscores the 
potential importance of pharmaceutical-grade CS in the manage-
ment of knee OA, especially in this older population requiring 
long-term treatment. More generally, this study corroborates 
the need for future clinical guidelines on the pharmacological 
management of knee OA to consider the study design, as well as 
the composition and quality of the test product, when assessing 
the effectiveness of SYSADOAs.
