Abstract
Background: Historically, marital status has been associated with lower mortality and transitions into marriage
were generally accompanied by improved health status. Conversely, divorce has been associated with increased
mortality, possibly mediated by changes in health behaviors.
Methods: This study uses data from a prospective cohort of 79,094 postmenopausal women participating in the
Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS) to examine the relationship between marital transition
and health indicators (blood pressure, waist circumference, body mass index [BMI]) as well as health behaviors
(diet pattern, alcohol use, physical activity, and smoking) in a sample of relatively healthy and employed women.
Linear and logistic regression modeling were used to test associations, controlling for confounding factors.
Results: Women’s transitions into marriage/marriage-like relationship after menopause were associated with
greater increase in BMI (b = 0.22; confidence interval (95% CI), 0.11–0.33) and alcohol intake (b = 0.08; 95%
CI, 0.04–0.11) relative to remaining unmarried. Divorce/separation was associated with a reduction in BMI and
waist circumference, changes that were accompanied by improvements in diet quality (b = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.10–
1.47) and physical activity (b = 0.98, 95% CI, 0.12–1.85), relative to women who remained married.
Conclusion: Contrary to earlier literature, these findings among well-educated, predominantly non-Hispanic
white women suggest that marital transitions after menopause are accompanied by modifiable health outcomes/
behaviors that are more favorable for women experiencing divorce/separation than those entering a new
marriage.

Introduction
T
he association between marital status and health has
been of interest in the medical and behavioral sciences
for over a century.1 Studies from the 1980’s suggested that
married individuals experienced less morbidity and lower
mortality than those who were not married, whereas being
single or experiencing the loss of a relationship from divorce
or death was associated with higher mortality.2–4 The pro-
tective effect of marriage has been hypothesized to be related
to the economic and social support, as well as regulation of
behaviors that marriage provides which are disrupted in di-
vorce, thus leading to adverse health effects.5 Data from these
earlier studies were largely cross-sectional in nature, providing
limited opportunity to evaluate the impact of marital experiences
on change in health. More recent reviews and meta-analyses

 provide insight into the results of prospective studies.1,4,6–8 In a
meta-analysis of older adults by Manzoli et al., divorced/
separated individuals had higher mortality than married in-
dividuals, with similar risk estimates for men and women.7 A
meta-analysis by Sbarra et al. showed that divorced/separated
individuals had a 23% higher risk of early death compared
with married individuals1 and a more recent meta-analysis
identified a 30% higher mortality among divorced/separated
compared with married individuals.4
Changes in health behaviors such as diet, physical ac-
tivity, smoking, and/or alcohol use may occur during marital
status transitions and could explain the relationship between
these exposures and mortality. These modifiable lifestyle
behaviors are important given the empirical evidence of
associations with chronic disease and mortality.9,10 Studies
evaluating weight change, particularly for women, provide
conflicting evidence, and it is unclear if marital transitions
affect younger and older women differently. This is of in-
terest given the doubling of the rate of divorce in those over
age 50.11 A more recent review, evaluating studies pub-
lished between 1990 and 2011, found new marriage gener-
ally was associated with weight gain.12 The relationship
of divorce and weight change is less clear. One study found
no significant associations between divorce and weight
change among women with an average age of 45.7 years
who were married at baseline, but divorced 10 years later,13
and yet the Nurses’ Health Study which focused on older
women, age 46–71, found divorce to be associated with a
decrease in body mass index (BMI).14 Still other research
has suggested that reductions in BMI after divorce were
temporary.12,15
The effects of marital transitions on body weight could be
related to changes in diet as suggested by Lee et al. who
found new marriage to be associated with higher vegetable
consumption and divorce to be associated with lower energy
and vegetable intake. In this same study physical activity
was not associated with either marital transition.14 A study
utilizing a treadmill-based fitness test in married individuals
found that marriage, relative to single status, was associated
with lower fitness.16 Marital transitions also may be associated
with changes in alcohol and tobacco use. An increase in alcohol
intake with new marriage was demonstrated in one study,14 but
not another.17 Similar inconsistencies have been reported for
tobacco use.14,18,19
The current study investigated the impact of marital tran-
sitions on health behaviors in the largest prospective sample
of postmenopausal women to date, to identify modifiable
behavioral targets for health promotion and prevention.
Women who became widowed were not included in the
current study, since these women had been evaluated previ-
ously by Wilcox et al.17 Similar to past research,14,17 it was
hypothesized that postmenopausal women who entered a
marriage/marriage-like relationship would demonstrate an
increase in BMI/waist circumference over the 3-year study
period, potentially accompanied by decreased physical ac-
tivity and reduced diet quality. Change in alcohol use, to-
bacco use, and blood pressure were also explored.
Data and Methods
The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) is a multicenter study
that began in 1992 and sought to characterize and better un-
derstand the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in
postmenopausal women. Between 1993 and 1998, women
were recruited from 40 clinical centers across the United States.
Full details of the WHI design are reported elsewhere.20 The
WHI Observational Study (WHI-OS) included 93,676 women
who were either specifically recruited to the OS or were
identified and offered participation after being determined in-
eligible or uninterested in the WHI clinical trials. Inclusion
criteria for the WHI-OS were age 50–79 years, postmeno-
pausal status, and plan to reside in the study area for at least 3
years. Exclusion criteria were medical conditions with pre-
dicted survival of <3 years, severe mental illness, dementia,
active alcoholism or drug dependency, or active participation
in any other intervention trial. Institutional Review Boards at
all study sites reviewed and approved the study protocol and all
participants provided written informed consent.
Study population
Of the 93,676 women in the WHI-OS, 81,920 had known
marital status at both baseline and year 3. The current anal-
ysis focused on the effects of entering marriage or a similar,
self-defined relationship, or becoming divorced or separated
and, therefore, considered subsamples of women in the
WHI-OS. To examine the effects of becoming married or en-
tering a marriage-like relationship, the first analytic sample in-
cluded a subset of women (n=30,108) who were unmarried at
baseline (i.e., those who were divorced/separated, widowed, or
never married) and either remained unmarried (n=28,572) or
became married (including those entering self-defined marriage-
like relationships) (n=1,536) at year 3. The second set of ana-
lyses focused on women partnered at baseline (i.e., married or in
a marriage-like relationship at baseline) (n=48,986) who either
stayed partnered (n=48,316) or became divorced or separated
(n=670) by year 3. Those who became widowed (n=2,792)
were not included in the analysis since these data were previ-
ously studied by Wilcox et al.17 Also, women with inconsistent
data (e.g., ‘‘married’’ at baseline to ‘‘never married’’ at year 3,
n=14) were excluded.
Demographic and marital status measures
Participants reported written demographic information,
including age, race/ethnicity, education, and family income.
Additionally, women were asked, ‘‘What is your current
marital status?’’ at baseline and at the 3-year visit. Response
categories were ‘‘never married,’’ ‘‘divorced or separated,’’
‘‘widowed,’’ ‘‘presently married,’’ or ‘‘marriage-like rela-
tionship.’’ The category ‘‘marriage-like relationship’’ was
left open to self-interpretation. No distinction or further
questions were asked with regard to opposite/same sex re-
lationships, or cohabitation. To study the effect of becoming
married (including entering a marriage-like relationship), the
categories of ‘‘never married,’’ ‘‘divorced or separated,’’ and
‘‘widowed’’ were combined into a ‘‘not married’’ at baseline
group. To study the effects of divorce/separation, the cate-
gories of ‘‘presently married’’ and ‘‘marriage-like relation-
ship’’ were combined into a ‘‘married’’ at baseline group.
Psychosocial measures
Psychosocial measures were identified as covariates in the
analysis and included emotional well-being, social functioning,
314

 depression, and social support. Emotional well-being and social
functioning were measured from well-established scales of
items from the Short Form-36.21 Emotional well-being was
measured with five items. For example, participants were asked
how often in the last 4 weeks they had felt ‘‘calm and peace-
ful,’’ with six response categories ranging from ‘‘all of the
time’’ to ‘‘none of the time.’’ Social functioning consisted of
two items. Participant were asked, ‘‘During the past 4 weeks,
to what extent has your physical health or emotional problems
interfered with your normal social activities with family,
friends, neighbors, or groups,’’ with five potential responses
ranging from ‘‘not at all’’ to ‘‘extremely.’’ Additionally, they
were asked, ‘‘During the past 4 weeks, how much of the time
has your physical health or emotional problems interfered with
your social activities (like visiting with friends, relatives,
etc.)?’’ Response categories consisted of five items ranging
from ‘‘all of the time’’ to ‘‘none of the time.’’ For both emo-
tional well-being and social functioning, scale scores were
recoded utilizing a 0 to 100 scale (e.g., values assigned as ‘‘0,’’
‘‘25,’’ ‘‘50,’’ etc.). Items were averaged with a higher score
indicating better emotional well-being or social functioning
following the established Short Form-36 coding rules by Ware
& Sherbourne.19
Depression was measured by a shortened version of
the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D).22 Individual items on this scale were logistically
weighted resulting in an overall score that ranged from 0 to
1, with scores above 0.06 consistent with depression.23 The
sensitivity of CES-D for detecting depression or dysthymia
has been reported at 86% in primary care populations and
92% in mental health populations.23
Social support was assessed using nine items from the
Medical Outcomes Study questionnaire.24 Participants used a
5-point scale to rank how often different aspects of social
support were available. These aspects included emotional
support, affectionate relationships, tangible support, and
positive interactions.
Physical measurements
Dependent variables included blood pressure, waist cir-
cumference, and BMI. Physical measurements (e.g., height,
weight, waist, and blood pressure) were assessed by trained
study personnel using standard protocols during in-person
study visits. Height and weight measurements were taken
without shoes and in light clothing. BMI was calculated
based on these values as weight in kilograms divided by
height in meters squared. Blood pressure was measured with
standardized, study-wide protocol that included using an
average of two readings taken after at least 5 minutes rest.
Waist circumference was measured in centimeters at the
umbilicus, again using standardized training and measure-
ment protocols (The Women’s Health Initiative Study
Group 1998).20
Diet/health behaviors
Diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity, and smoking
status were additional dependent variables of interest. Diet-
ary information was summarized from the WHI Food Fre-
quency Questionnaire (FFQ).25 The FFQ includes 122 items
on foods and food groups. Questions are directed at fre-
quency of intake of a particular food/nutrient and portion
size. Participants were asked to recall their average intake
of a particular food over the past 3-month period.25 Dietary
data that reported unreliable intake (<600 or >5,000 kcal/day)
were excluded. The Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)
was calculated from dietary data reported on the WHI FFQ
and used as a standardized indicator of overall dietary quality
in this analysis.26 High index scores have been associated with
decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.27,28
Physical activity was measured by several items, which
asked participants how often they walked outside the home
for >10 minutes without stopping; how many minutes they
did this; and at what speed. Participants reported the fre-
quency and duration of various types of strenuous and mod-
erate exercises with examples provided. This information was
used to compute a variety of recreational physical activities
recorded in metabolic equivalents (MET)-hours/week.29,30
Smoking status was ascertained by self-report. Participants
were asked, ‘‘During your entire life, have you smoked at
least 100 cigarettes?’’ Those responding ‘‘no’’ were classi-
fied as a ‘‘never’’ smoker. Those responding ‘‘yes’’ were then
asked if they currently smoked cigarettes. Based on this re-
sponse, participants were classified as ‘‘former’’ or ‘‘cur-
rent’’ smokers.
Statistical analysis
Two distinct sets of analyses were performed. The first
examined the effects of transitions from not married into
marriage or a marriage-like relationship on the outcomes of
interest defined above. The second focused on transitions
from marriage or marriage-like relationship to divorce or
separation on the same physical measurements and health
behaviors. Specifically, linear regression models were de-
veloped for both analyses for change (year 3 minus baseline)
in the following variables: systolic blood pressure, diastolic
blood pressure, waist circumference, BMI, AHEI, alcohol
intake, and physical activity. Each model calculated a b-
coefficient and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the effect of
marriage (or divorce) on each outcome. Results were con-
sidered significant at the p < 0.05 level.
Logistic regression models examined the relationships for
marital transitions and smoking status. The effect of marriage
(or divorce) on the transition from nonsmoking at baseline to
smoking at year 3 was tested in the subgroup of women who
were nonsmokers at baseline (never or former). Additionally,
the effect of marriage (or divorce) on the transition from
smoking at baseline to nonsmoking at year 3 was tested in the
subgroup of women who were current smokers at baseline.
Each model calculated an odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI on the
effect of marriage (or divorce) on starting/resuming or quit-
ting smoking. Results were considered significant at the
p < 0.05 level.
Marital transition status was the main independent variable
of interest. Based on literature review, models were further
adjusted for age (continuous); baseline level of outcome
measure; race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white vs. other); in-
come (<$20k, $20k to <$35k, $35k to <$50k, $50k to <$75k,
‡$75k); education (£high school, some college, ‡college
graduate); social support at baseline (continuous); emotional
well-being at year 3 (continuous); social functioning at year 3
(continuous); and depression score at year 3 (continuous).
Blood pressure models were further adjusted for reported use

 of antihypertensive medication or beta-blockers at year 3.
Marginal predictions were calculated separately for each
marital status group, assuming average values of all other
covariates, for each outcome variable.
For the analysis that tested the effect of new marriage, a
sensitivity analysis was conducted wherein different sub-
groups of ‘‘not married’’ women (never married, widowed, or
divorced) were examined separately. Additionally, for the
analysis testing the effect of new divorce/separation, a sen-
sitivity analysis was conducted wherein the categories of
‘‘marriage’’ and ‘‘marriage-like relationships’’ were exam-
ined separately. All analyses were performed using Stata 13.1
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, 2013).
Results
Demographic characteristics and baseline measures by
marital transition status are displayed in Table 1. Compar-
isons across marital status categories were all strongly sig-
nificant (all p < 0.001). Women who transitioned out of or
into marriage tended to be younger than those who either
stayed married or remained unmarried. Those who became

 divorced had higher baseline measures of depression and
lower measures of emotional well-being, social functioning,
and social support than those who remained married. Health
behaviors were different across marital transitions groups.
Women who became married reported higher diet quality,
physical activity, and alcohol intake than those who stayed
single. Smoking rates were lowest in the stayed-married group.
Data for the 14,582 women excluded from the analysis due
to incomplete/inconsistent marital status or divorce are not
shown. Comparison of these women to those included in
Table 1 revealed statistically significant differences in that
fewer reported being white (73.4%); lower education and
economic levels; lower scores on psychosocial measures;
higher depression scores (0.06); higher BMI (27.5 kg/m2);
worse dietary scores; less physical activity (12.3 MET-hours/
week); less alcohol intake (0.34 drinks per day); and higher
rates of current smoking (9.4%).
Table 2 displays the linear regression results for the effect
of new marriage on change in physical measurements and
health behaviors over 3 years. Although both groups of women
gained weight over the 3-year period, in the fully adjusted
model, women who became married experienced a greater
increase in BMI, compared to those that remained unmarried
( p < 0.001). Both groups of women experienced a slight in-
crease in waist circumference, but this was not different be-
tween the groups ( p = 0.998). Systolic blood pressure
decreased in women who remained unmarried, but increased
in women who became married ( p = 0.027). Diastolic blood
pressure decreased in both groups, but to a lesser extent in
women who became married ( p = 0.018). Interestingly, AHEI
(dietary quality) scores improved for both groups of women
without differences between groups ( p = 0.680). Alcohol in-
take decreased slightly for unmarried women, but increased for
women who became married ( p < 0.001). Physical activity
decreased for both groups without significant differences be-
tween the groups ( p = 0.492).
For unmarried women who did not smoke at baseline, new
marriage was not associated with starting/resuming smoking
(OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.61–1.87; p = 0.808). Additionally, for
unmarried women who smoked at baseline, becoming mar-
ried was not associated with smoking cessation (OR, 1.11;
95% CI, 0.71–1.72; p = 0.646).
The effect of transitioning from marriage to divorce/
separation on health outcomes is displayed in Table 3. BMI
increased for women who remained married, but decreased
slightly for women who became divorced/separated (p<0.001).
Waist circumference followed a similar pattern with an increase
for women who remained married versus a small decrease in
women who became divorced/separated ( p < 0.001). Blood
pressure measures decreased for both groups of women, with
greater decreases in women who became divorced/separated
that was significant for diastolic ( p = 0.005), but not systolic
( p = 0.072) blood pressure. The mean dietary AHEI score
also increased (improved) for both groups of women, with
larger improvements for the divorced/separated women
( p = 0.025). Physical activity increased in the divorced/sep-
arated women compared with a decrease in women who re-
mained married ( p = 0.026). Changes in alcohol intake were
not significantly different between groups ( p = 0.105).
For married women who were nonsmokers at baseline
(either ‘‘never’’ or ‘‘former,’’ n = 513), the odds of starting/
resuming smoking were significantly higher in women who
became divorced/separated than those who remained married
(OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.96–7.09; p < 0.001). While the majority
of these women were former smokers, about 5% were new
smokers. However, there was no effect of divorce/separation
on smoking cessation among current smokers at baseline
(OR, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.65–2.29; p = 0.543).
Sensitivity analyses examining the effects of new marriage,
restricting the sample to women who were ‘‘never married’’ at
baseline did not change the direction of the findings listed in
Table 2, but findings previously significant for blood pressure,
BMI, and alcohol intake were no longer significant. Those
‘‘never married’’ at baseline, who remained unmarried had
significantly greater declines in physical activity level than
those who became married (b-coefficient, -2.4; 95% CI,
-4.49 to -0.31; p = 0.024) (see Supplementary Table S1;
Supplementary Data are available online at www.liebertpub
.com/jwh). Restricting the analyses to those ‘‘divorced’’ or
‘‘widowed’’ at baseline did not change the findings in Table 2.

MARITAL STATUS AND HEALTH IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN
317
 For analyses examining the effects of new divorce or
separation, baseline marriage and marriage-like relationships
were examined separately. Including only those ‘‘presently
married’’ at baseline in the analysis did not change the sig-
nificance of the findings displayed in Table 3 with the ex-
ception that differences in physical activity were no longer
significant (b-coefficient, 0.52; 95% CI, -0.45 to -1.48;
p = 0.295) (see Supplementary Table S2). Due to small
sample size, sensitivity analysis was not performed on the
smoking status logistic regression models.
Discussion
In our sample getting married between baseline and year 3
was associated with an increase in BMI and alcohol con-
sumption compared with those who remained unmarried.
These changes likely influenced the increase in systolic and
diastolic blood pressure demonstrated here.9 The magnitude
of these changes was small. For example, although both
groups of women gained weight during the 3-year study pe-
riod, those who became married increased BMI by 0.56 kg/
m2 versus 0.34 kg/m2 in those who stayed single. This cor-
responds to a weight gain of about 1 kg (2.2 lbs.) for those
who became married. Even modest increases in weight can
promote an undesirable elevation in blood pressure.31,32
The current study’s findings are consistent with the ma-
jority of prior studies demonstrating the association of new
marriage with weight gain.12 Overall, the magnitude of
weight gain demonstrated in these studies was around 2 kg,
which is slightly higher than the weight gain noted in the
present study. The weight gain seen in the present study,
however, was not accompanied by clear changes in diet or
physical activity. While imprecision in measurement for self-
reported diet and activity may account for the lack of asso-
ciation,33 it is possible, as others have suggested, that the
shared, regular mealtimes characteristic of married life may
result in larger portion sizes which, in turn, contribute to
weight increase.34 The current findings point to the need for
greater awareness by healthcare providers regarding the po-
tential for weight gain with marriage. The findings support
the importance of counseling women on weight maintenance
strategies during times of marital transitions.
Divorced/separated women experienced weight loss rela-
tive to women who stayed married. Past research in this area
has yielded mixed results.13–15 Differing ages of women
studied may account for the variable findings shown here.35
Specifically, the effect of new divorce/separation on body
weight may be more significant for older women. Lee, using
data from the Nurses’ Health Study of women with average
age older than 60, found that women who became divorced
had a mean BMI decrease of 0.65 kg/m2 relative to the BMI
change in women who remained married in a follow-up pe-
riod of 4 years.14 In the present study, the BMI decrease in
divorced, older women was relatively small, averaging
0.09 kg/m2 over 3 years; the significance of this finding was
driven more by the relative increase in BMI in those who
remained married. The reason for this weight loss remains
unclear, but the relationship persisted after controlling for
emotional well-being, social functioning, and depression.
Accompanying improvements in eating patterns and physical
activity level suggest that these women were actively en-
gaged in improving their health.
Different lengths of follow-up in published studies also
may have affected weight loss results. Umberson et al. in a
15-year study, found that weight loss among newly divorced
women was only a short-term (3–4 year) phenomenon and is
not a major contributor to adult weight gain given the ten-
dency of adults to continue to gain weight over their life-
spans.15 Also, many women will remarry and, as noted
above, this is frequently accompanied by marital transition-
associated weight gain.
The transition to divorce or separation was associated with
other expected and unexpected findings. Divorced/separated
women were more likely to start smoking than women who

 stayed married, but new divorce/separation also was associ-
ated with positive health outcomes and behaviors. Compared
with their counterparts who stayed married, divorced/sepa-
rated women demonstrated reductions in blood pressure and
increases in physical activity at least during the short-term
observation period examined here.
Wilcox et al. examined marital transitions in WHI-OS par-
ticipants (n = 38,483) with a focus on widowhood. In this study,
slightly different statistical methodologies were employed and
the reference group for all comparisons was women who
remained married and were not widowed.17 Comparison of
this study’s findings to that of Wilcox provides a wider lens
for understanding the impact of marital transitions on older
women. Similar to the current findings, systolic blood pressure
increased in widows who remarried over a 3-year period
relative to those who remained married ( p < 0.01). Widows
who remarried also demonstrated a weight gain (2.3 kg) rela-
tive to those who stayed married, and newly widowed women
experienced weight loss ( p = 0.04), but this was not significant
at the study’s predetermined p < 0.01 level of significance.
Women in the WHI-OS who became married did not re-
port changes in eating patterns or physical activity that dif-
fered from women who remained unmarried. Sensitivity
analyses revealed that physical activity patterns were de-
pendent on type of unmarried status. Never-married women
who became married reported a decrease in physical activity,
whereas divorced or separated women who became married
did not report changes in physical activity relative to women
who remained single. Additionally, newly divorced or sep-
arated women exhibited positive changes in eating patterns
and physical activity relative to women who stayed married.
This finding is contrary to the findings of others, including
Lee who studied women of a similar age group and found no
differences in physical activity levels,14 possibly reflecting
differences in physical activity assessment.36
Although getting married did not affect smoking initiation
or cessation, newly divorced women were more likely to start
smoking than those who remained single. These results, while
consistent with results from the Nurses’ Health Study,14 should
be viewed with caution, given the small number of women
who started/resumed smoking and became divorced (n = 11).
Limitations and strengths
This study is limited by several factors. First, the time period
of evaluation is relatively short; thus, one does not know if the
changes seen here continued over a longer period of time.
Study questionnaires did not capture lifetime marital history,
for example, number of divorces and remarriages and the rel-
ative duration of a particular marital state. Cumulative marital
experiences may more strongly predict health and mortality.6
Furthermore, the WHI-OS women may not be representative of
all women. Relevant to interpretation of our findings, WHI-OS
women had higher socioeconomic status and educational at-
tainment, scored higher on psychosocial measures, and were
less likely to smoke than the population at large. Thus, these
women may have been more resilient and health conscious,
mitigating the effect of stressful life events like divorce.
Despite these limitations, the WHI-OS dataset provides a
unique opportunity to study the prospective relationship be-
tween marital transitions and health behaviors in a large
sample of postmenopausal women while controlling for a
greater array of psychosocial variables (e.g., social support,
social functioning, and depression) rarely available in similar,
large prospective studies. Importantly, the cohort is under
ongoing observation for select health outcomes, including
cardiovascular disease, cancers, and mortality. A future anal-
ysis should be performed to evaluate these marital transitions
in relation to diagnostic and mortality outcomes to expand the
knowledge gained from WHI. Another strength includes ob-
jective measurements (rather than self-report) of height,
weight, and waist circumference at two time points and the
collection of detailed information on diet and physical activity.
Conclusion
Among educated, predominantly non-Hispanic white
postmenopausal women the period after divorce or separation
is accompanied by several positive health behavior changes.
Increased tobacco use was the exception. Alternatively, new
marriage was associated with a greater increase in BMI and
alcohol intake. These data suggest that health behaviors
should be evaluated during marital transitions that occur after
menopause and appropriate health education and support
should be provided to optimize health outcomes as indicated.
