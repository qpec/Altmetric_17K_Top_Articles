The neurological deterioration associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), involving
accumulation of amyloid-beta peptides and neurofibrillary tangles, is associated with
evident neuroinflammation. This is now seen to be a significant contributor to pathology.
Recently the tenet of the privileged status of the brain, regarding microbial compromise,
has been questioned, particularly in terms of neurodegenerative diseases. It is now
being considered that microbiological incursion into the central nervous system could
be either an initiator or significant contributor to these. This is a novel study using
16S ribosomal gene-specific Next generation sequencing (NGS) of extracted brain
tissue. A comparison was made of the bacterial species content of both frozen
and formaldehyde fixed sections of a small cohort of Alzheimer-affected cases with
those of cognitively unimpaired (normal). Our findings suggest an increase in bacterial
populations in Alzheimer brain tissue compared with normal.

INTRODUCTION
Pathological triggers, culminating in the eventual loss of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), are widely acknowledged to occur up to two decades before symptoms arise (Bateman et al.,
2012). It is acknowledged that the increased level of amyloid Aβ42 in the brain parenchyma, due to
either increased production of amyloid or its decreased removal, is likely to contribute substantially
to this. However, understanding why the presence of excessive levels of Aβ do not necessarily
result in cognitive impairment (Katzman et al., 1988; Hulette et al., 1998; Price and Morris, 1999;
Aizenstein et al., 2008; Esparza et al., 2013) may be related to the known role of inflammation and
the importance of the response of the innate immune system, which are also recognized as essential
factors (Heneka et al., 2015b). The common sporadic form of AD arises from a large number of
possible risk factors. The presence of the E4 polymorphism of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) has
long been known to be the most potent risk factor for sporadic AD, second only to age. One
reason for this is likely to be its importance in the clearance of Aβ, another may be its influence
on inflammatory response and its adverse influence on the integrity of the blood-brain barrier
(BBB; Bell, 2012), which is pertinent when discussing the level of privilege the brain retains (Yu
et al., 2014). The E4 polymorphism is proinflammatory, unlike the more common E3 form, which
facilitates suppression of inflammation (LaDu et al., 2001; Guo et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005).

Further to this, multicenter genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) have identified susceptibility loci on genes which may
increase or decrease the risk of AD (Bertram and Tanzi, 2009).
The polymorphisms found by these studies to be associated
with AD are thought to mainly affect three functional systems:
immune and inflammation responses, lipid metabolism and
endosomal vesicle recycling (Tosto and Reitz, 2013; Guerreiro
and Hardy, 2014). Evidence suggests that the influence of
neuroinflammation is involved at an early stage of AD (Akiyama
et al., 2000b; Holmes et al., 2009; Perry et al., 2010; Perry
and Holmes, 2014) and it has been demonstrated that a
microbiological insult, including bacteria or virus, may trigger,
or contribute to neuroinflammation and subsequent neurological
damage (Miklossy, 2011; Mawanda and Wallace, 2013; Hill et al.,
2014; Cerajewska et al., 2015; Olsen and Singhrao, 2015, 2016;
Shoemark and Allen, 2015; Itzhaki et al., 2016; Miklossy and
McGeer, 2016).
The evidence so far is reliant on histology and other methods
that require prior knowledge of which bacterial species to look
for. Here we use 16S ribosomal RNA gene next generation
sequencing (NGS) in a pilot comparative study in normal and
AD-affected brains to determine the range and extent of bacterial
species present in this brain tissue.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cohort Study
Frozen and paraffin embedded tissue was obtained, with local
Research Ethics Committee approval, from the South West
Dementia Brain bank (SWDBB), University of Bristol, UK.
(SWDBB #ITA058). All studies conformed to relevant regulatory
standards. All brain samples are routinely assessed by the South
West BB for prion disease; only brain samples from subjects free
of prion disease pathology were released for this study. Handling
of the samples required the use of suitable personal protective
equipment including mask and protective eye-wear, and was
carried out in a lamina flow hood, to prevent contamination
in either direction. Left hemispheres are routinely sliced and
frozen at −80◦C; the right hemispheres are formalin fixed
for neuropathological assessment and for immunohistochemical
analysis. For this study, formalin fixed paraffin embedded
sections (denoted here as S) and tissue from frozen slices
(denoted here as F) were used from the temporal cortex (BA
38/40) of patients with AD and non-demented controls (C). The
diagnosis of AD was according to standard criteria as specified
in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association,
2000). Table 1 shows the properties of the cohort. Control
and AD samples were then age and post mortem delay (PMD)
matched except for an additional control (#678) which was added
to allow assessment of changes of bacterial content with extended
PMD (216 h).
DNA Extraction
DNA was extracted from frozen tissue, first by homogenization
of 50–100 mg using a pellet pestle (Sigma) in a 1.5 ml
microcentrifuge tube. The homogenate was resuspended in 1ml
of Tris EDTA (T.E.) buffer (10 mM Tris pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA),
extracted with 0.5 ml of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
(Sigma), then 0.5 ml chloroform, and DNA ethanol precipitated
with 2 volumes of ethanol in the presence of 0.2 M NaCl. After
sedimentation at 16,000× g, the DNA pellet was washed with
70% then 100% ethanol and air-dried before being dissolved in
50 µl of T.E. buffer. The entire procedure was carried out under
sterile conditions in a lamina-flow hood. DNA from formalin-
fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sections was extracted using
the Qiagen DNA FFPE Tissue kit (Qiagen 56404) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions except for the following
modifications: the outermost 2 mm of each section was removed
using a 1 ml sterile pipette tip along with all surrounding paraffin.
The section was then incubated at 85◦C for 1 h to melt the
paraffin, which was then removed by incubation for 10 min in
xylene. Each section was washed in situ extensively with 100%
ethanol using a wash bottle. The tissue was then scraped into
a 1.5 ml centrifuge tube as stipulated in the protocol. The area
from which the tissue was removed was then washed with 180 µl
of ATL tissue lysis buffer (Qiagen) which was pooled with the
tissue. From this point onwards the method was according to the
manufacturer’s protocol.
DNA Quantification
Initial DNA concentrations were obtained by A260/280 absorption
using a NanoPhotometer P-Class (Implen, Munchen, Germany).
Most samples gave an A260/280 ratio between 2 and 1.8. Samples
with ratios lower than 1.7 were rejected.

the brain of bacteria from the widest possible taxonomical
spectrum.

primer F342 (5�-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG) was derived
and used in combination with the reverse primer 518R (5�-
ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG). These primers are designated
‘‘primer pair 1’’. They are similar to those described by
Chakravorty et al. (2007) who systematically assessed 16S
variable regions for their ability to distinguish between
110 bacteria, representing a wide spectrum at the genus level, and
tested with a mixed population containing 24 different bacterial
genera. Dendrogram analysis showed that this primer pair could
distinguish between all 110 species examined. Mori et al. (2014)
also carried out a systematic study of possible universal 16S
PCR primers that had low probability of amplifying eukaryotic

sequences. Apart from one G to A substitution, their primer 342F
is the same as that described here and showed good taxonomic
coverage.
PCR
Each amplicon was generated using 700 ng of starting material in
a 50 µl reaction containing 1× Platinum Taq buffer with 0.2 µl
Platinum Taq (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA),
1.5 mM MgCl2, each nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) at 200 µM
and each primer at 1 µM final concentration. An initial 5 min
denaturation step at 95◦C was followed by 40 cycles of 95◦C, 30 s;
65◦C, 30 s; 72◦C, 30 s with a final 7 min extension at 72◦C.
PCR Analysis
The PCR of the variable region 3 was repeated using 1200 ng
of starting material on an extended, but overlapping cohort
of frozen samples. Consistent with the original PCR, the
amplicon consisted of two bands (bands 1 and 2, Supplementary
Figure S1) superimposed over a faint smear. Band 1 is
approximately 200 bp, which corresponds to the variable
region-3 product of the majority of bacterial species using these
primers. The smaller band 2 is consistent with the product
size predicted for both the human 18S product (174 bp) and
Propionobacteria and Corynebacteria (168 bp).
Amplicon Processing
Amplicons were electrophoresed in a 2% agarose gel using
1× Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (T.E.A. buffer: 40 mM Tris
pH 7.6, 20 mM acetic acid, 1 mM EDTA) and purified
by Qiaquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden.
Germany#28704). Amplicons were further purified using the
Agencourt Ampure XP beads (Auto Q Biosciences Ltd, UK)
and then quantified using the High Sensitivity Qubit kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific). Amplicon sizes were determined
using the DNA 1000 Tapestation assay (Agilent Technologies,
US). Using the amplicon size and Qubit concentrations, the
sample concentrations were normalized to 10 nM. A pool of
amplicons at 10 nM was created by adding 5 µl of each
normalized amplicon to a single pool. The pool was re-quantified
using the Qubit High Sensitivity assay to determine the volume
required to take 100 ng into the library preparation stages. The
concentration of the amplicon pool was 1.6 ng/µl.
Library Preparation
One-hundred nanogram of the amplicon pool was taken into the
Life Technologies Ion Plus Fragment Library Kit (ThermoFisher
Scientific) protocol for amplicons without fragmentation and
the protocol was followed without deviation. The resulting
library,
created
by
IonXpress
Adapter
5
(ThermoFisher
Scientific; sequence CAGAAGGAAC), was verified for size
using a TapeStation High Sensitivity DNA 1000 assay (Agilent
Technologies, US).
Sequencing
Template generation and sequencing were performed using
the following Life Technologies kits: Ion PGM OT2 400 Kit;
Ion PGM Sequencing Kit 400; Ion 318v2 chip. Protocols
were followed according to manufacturer’s instructions without
deviation.
NGS Analysis
NGS data was processed using a custom quality control
(QC) pipeline including the use of seqtk and trimmomatic
(Bolger et al., 2014) which de-convoluted and trimmed the
barcode sequences from the reads and filtered for quality
by

reads were then processed using Qiime1 (Caporaso et al.,
2010b). Sequence chimera filtering was carried out using both
reference and de novo methods, with only sequences that pass
both these being retained and operational taxonomic units
(OTUs) selected based on a 97% similarity with a minimum
of 3 reads representing each OTU, both methods utilizing

uclust (Edgar, 2010; Edgar et al., 2011). Following alignment
to the Greengenes Core reference alignment (DeSantis et al.,
2006) using PyNAST (Caporaso et al., 2010a), taxonomies were
assigned using the uclust method (Edgar, 2010; Edgar et al.,
2011) and phylogeny generated using FastTree (Price et al.,
2010). An OTU table was generated from these results, and
alpha and beta diversity metrics generated using the standard
QIIME tools, with the latter being calculated using UniFrac
(Lozupone and Knight, 2005) and visualized using Emperor
(Vázquez-Baeza et al., 2013). Data summarized in excel format

RESULTS
Amplicon Generation and Assessment of
Possible Contamination
Using primer pair 1, amplicons were generated that contained
bands ranging approximately from 170–220 bp. These were
gel purified and concentrations normalized prior to library
preparation and NGS analysis.
To assess taxonomic coverage, observed taxonomic diversity
was plotted against sampled read depth using alpha rarefaction
analysis. This showed that a read depth of 20,000 was required
for adequate representation of OTU diversity. Control samples
F781C, F102C, F90C, F721C and S412C fell below this threshold
and, therefore, the data from these may not fully represent
the taxonomic diversity of the bacterial populations from these
samples. The samples analyzed by NGS are described in Table 1.
Age ranged from 62 years to 98 years, with Braak stages of 3 or 4
(controls) and 5 or 6 (AD).
It was not possible to completely avoid peri- or post-mortem
contamination and, in the case of FFPE sections, contamination
during storage (in cardboard holders). It was for these reasons
that both types of sample were analyzed in parallel; 102C and
781C were included as both FFPE and frozen samples. Sample
781C was relatively consistent between the different sources,
with both FFPE section (S781C) and frozen tissue (F781C)
bacteria comprising approximately 40%–45% Actinobacteria
and 35%–45% Proteobacteria with 10%–15% Firmicutes and
2% other. FFPE sections from 102C contained predominantly
Proteobacteria, whereas the frozen tissue sample of 102C
(F102C) was predominantly composed of Fusobacteria. This
increased Fusobacteria contribution was almost entirely confined
to this one sample. Therefore, these data suggest that, although
there is variability, neither type of sample preparation introduced
method-specific bias or contamination.
In order to assess levels of peri-mortem contamination, PMD
was plotted against total bacterial reads for each individual
(Figure 1A). Neither bacterial reads from AD nor control
correlated with age by linear regression analysis (p = 0.80 and
0.11 respectively). PMD did not significantly correlate with
bacterial reads in control (p = 0.055) or AD (p = 0.491). The
sample number is too low for definitive analysis, but these
data suggest that contamination from PMD is not a significant
factor and, furthermore, increased levels of bacterial reads are
associated strongly with AD compared to normal individuals and
not with age (Figure 1B).
Contaminating exogenous DNA also provides a major
technical difficulty. This is especially true of low biomass
experiments and where target DNA is extremely dilute (Lusk,
2014; Salter et al., 2014). Ideally, ‘‘no template’’ controls
should be included. These controls consistently identified
multiple Alpha-proteobacteria including Methylobacteriaceae;
multiple Beta-proteobacteria, Gamma-Proteobacteria, including
Enterobacteriaceae
and
Escherichia,
Firmicutes
including
Streptococcus
(but
not
Staphylococcus),
Actinobacteria
including
Corynebacteriaceae
and
Propionibacteriaceae,
Bacteroidetes, Deinococcus and Acidobacteria (Salter et al.,
2014; Salzberg et al., 2016). These contaminants vary between
repeat experiments, are laboratory and operator-specific and
can derive from any stage in the metagenomics sequencing
process, including DNA-extraction kits and molecular biology-
grade water (Salter et al., 2014). In the study presented here,
although a PCR product was invariably generated in no-template
controls, yields were too low to analyze by NGS without further
amplification and indeed, control brain samples did not generate
enough amplicon to produce fully representative libraries. AD
and control samples were treated in exactly the same manner,
yet massively more bacterial 16S reads were yielded from
AD samples, strongly suggesting that contamination is not a
major issue for these data. One possible source of bacterial
‘‘contamination’’ in our tissue, blood, needs to be addressed. A
recent 16S NGS study carried out on normal (control) blood
samples provides a good base-line for this (Paisse et al., 2016).
Blood is shown to contain around 1.8–7.6 × 107 16S sequences
per ml of whole blood. These levels must be reflected in our
data to some extent. The taxonomic profile seen in our study
for non-AD brain is similar to that for blood as shown by Paisse
et al. (2016; Table 3) with Proteobacteria by far the highest
percentage. In comparison, our profile of AD brain is different
with Actinobacteria as the largest component. Additionally,
for these data, the largest Proteobacteria component is Alpha-
proteobacteria; Rhizobiales; Methylobacteriaceae (Figure 2D),
which as an environmental rhizobial bacterium is listed as a
common contaminant (Laurence et al., 2014) and displays
a
random
distribution
between
control
and
AD
brains
(Figure 2D).
Primer Specificity and Taxonomic
Coverage
Primer pair 1 generated an NGS data set containing 23 phyla
and 178 taxa at the family level. However, 342F has 86% and
518R 100% identity to equivalent sites within the human 18S
rRNA gene and together they generate a 168 bp human 18S PCR
product with high efficiency. Therefore, the human 18S product
was co-purified along with the bacterial amplicon. This resulted
in the largest operating taxonomic units being taxonomically
unassigned in the initial analysis with subsequent BLASTN
analysis of representative sequences against the NCBI nucleotide
collection revealing them to be either an uncultured bacterial
species (accession KJ766015.2; 252/252 query coverage: 100%,

alignment, human 18S rRNA (NR046235.1). These data could
not differentiate between these two candidates but it is thought,
in all probability, to be the latter. Unassigned OTUs, all of
which were h18S, were subtracted from the total read counts
for each individual to give revised total bacterial reads (Table 2)
which were used in all subsequent calculations of percentage
composition (Table 3).
Two individuals, both AD (498, 508) had large numbers of
human 18S reads. This remains unexplained; but could be due to
inconsistency in gel purification or amounts of human genomic
DNA present in each sample.
Comparison of Bacterial Populations in AD
and Control Samples
This NGS study was carried out with normalized, re-amplified
libraries and therefore was not designed to assess actual bacterial
numbers. However we see here a clear pattern with AD samples
yielding noticeably more bacterial reads than controls. This is
depicted in Figures 1D and 2.
Figure 1C shows the percentage compositions of each of
the four groups (FFPE controls, FFPE AD, Frozen Control
and Frozen AD) at the phylum level. Figure 1D which shows
average total bacterial reads for each of the four groups,
showing that there is a 5–10-fold more bacterial reads in
AD compared with control in both frozen tissue and FFPE
sections.
Table 3 compares these data with two other relevant studies:
massively parallel sequencing of cDNA generated from total
RNA from surgically removed brain samples and post-mortem
material, yielding total human cDNA sequences as well as
microbial sequences (Branton et al., 2013) and specifically
16S rRNA-directed-NGS on blood (Paisse et al., 2016). These
two studies and ours produce data in broad agreement with
each other with the same four phyla contributing between
81%–100%. Branton et al. (2013) differs somewhat from the
rest with large variations in Bacteroides up to 35% compared to

0.3%–3%. Our data differs from the other two in Actinobacteria
content with between 22%–74% compared to 5%–17% and
Proteobacteria with 20%–74% compared to 65%–87%. These
data also differ from the others in the composition of the
Proteobacteria component, with three out of four groups having
a majority of Alpha-proteobacteria with only one group having
Beta-proteobacteria as the predominant class.
Notably our data suggests Actinobacteria reads are higher
in AD samples compared to controls, with Proteobacteria
having a roughly inverse relationship. Firmicutes has a greater
percentage of reads in AD in FFPE, but not in frozen
tissue, and this was due to a large staphylococcal presence
in one sample. Actinobacteria are somewhat higher in our
controls compared to Branton et al. (2013) and Paisse et al.
(2016) and consistently higher in AD samples (Table 3
and Figures 2B,F). The Actinobacteria content seen here
consists primarily of Propionibacteriaceae, (Figure 2B) with
the largest OTUs being P. acnes. Actinobacteria accounts for
up to 10% of total reads in blood (Paisse et al., 2016) and
includes Corynebacteriaceae and 10 other Actinobacteria taxa
but no Propionibacteriaceae. Corynebacteriaceae (closely related
to Propionibacteriaceae) constitutes a much smaller proportion
of the Actinobacteria seen here, but, interestingly, displays a
similar distribution to P. acnes with consistently more seen in AD
samples.
Figure 2 summarizes the data at the family level expressed
in read counts, which is an indicator of bacterial numbers,
not an absolute or relative measure. Figure 2A shows that the
apparent raised levels of bacterial reads in AD samples are
in large part, and most consistently, due to Actinobacteria;
Propionibacteriaceae.
Further
BLASTN
searches
using
representative sequences from the top three Propionibacteriaceae
OTUs against the NCBI 16S rRNA database revealed them
all to be Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes; score: 259/259;
coverage: 100%; E value: 2e-69; identity: 100%). The other major
contributors are from Firmicutes with Staphylococcaceae as
the major component, but only present in one AD sample in
overwhelming numbers.

NGS of Bacteria in Alzheimer’s Post-Mortem Brain
Figures 2B–G displays individually the read count data
from those taxa that contribute most significantly and shows
that, in addition to the marked increase in Propionibacteriaceae
in AD samples, Actinobacteria; Corynebacteriaceae shows a
similar pattern, although at much lower levels. Firmicutes
Staphylococcaceae and Firmicutes ‘‘other’’ may also maintain this
bias, but it is less clear for Proteobacteria ‘‘other’’. Proteobacteria
methylobacteriacea, in contrast, although present at relatively
high levels, is fairly evenly distributed between controls and AD
samples. Other taxa were deemed to have too few counts to
analyze in this manner.
DISCUSSION
This 16S rRNA NGS study was carried out using normalized,
re-amplified libraries and, although not designed to assess
absolute bacterial load in samples, unexpectedly a pattern
emerged with AD samples yielding noticeably more bacterial
reads than controls.
16S rRNA Gene Sequencing from a High
Genomic Background
16S rRNA gene phylotyping (Woese and Fox, 1977; Woese et al.,
1985; Woese, 1987; Böttger, 1989; Pace, 1997; Clarridge, 2004),
combined with NGS technologies (Tringe and Hugenholtz,
2008; Arumugam et al., 2011) has revolutionized the study
of the human microbiome. Since many bacteria cannot be
cultured (Stewart, 2012), NGS is generally seen as the most
efficient way to attempt a comprehensive assessment of
bacterial arrays (Fournier et al., 2014). In addition, it has
been shown that, for very low abundance taxa within a
mixed population, deep metagenomics analysis is inadequate
in terms of read depth and 16S amplification and sequencing
by universal 16S primers is required (Mori et al., 2014).
The technical parameters of such NGS studies require PCR
sensitivity, broad taxonomic coverage and the ability to
differentiate well between bacterial 16S rRNA and eukaryotic
18S rRNA genes (Pace, 1997). Optimizing all three is extremely
difficult to achieve because broad-spectrum bacterial 16S
primers tend not to differentiate between bacterial 16S and
mammalian 18S rRNA genes. Additionally, both types of sample
used here require amplification of unknown, but potentially
extremely low levels of bacterial targets from an overwhelming
amount of human background DNA. By comparison The
Human Microbiome Project Consortium Human Microbiome
Project Consortium (2012) typically use samples obtained by
non-invasive techniques with a human genomic component of
up to 80%.
We chose here to emphasize the first two requirements at
the expense of the latter, using primers likely to have a broad
taxonomic spectrum and high PCR efficiency, but with a high
degree of similarity to their equivalent sites on the human
18S gene. The relatively extreme PCR conditions used were
the result of an attempt to reduce the 18S component; that
this was not entirely successful is clearly demonstrated in the
data. What cannot be demonstrated is to what extent these
PCR conditions affected bacterial taxonomic coverage although,
at least at the phylum level, our data agrees well with other
studies and within each phylum there is a wide spectrum of taxa
seen.
We have provided evidence that exogenous contaminating
species were not a major component of these data and that blood
is likely to be the only significant source of non brain-derived
bacteria. Control brain displays similar bacterial profiles to blood
whereas AD brain has a larger proportion of Actionobacteria.
We propose that the levels of 16S sequences seen here in normal
brains may be derived in part from its blood content and from
contaminating species introduced through the NGS process. This
means that these data show between 5 and 10 fold higher levels
of bacterial reads in AD brain compared with control. These
comparisons show that the species largely responsible for most of
the increased bacterial levels seen here in AD brains, Firmicutes
‘‘other’’, Staphylococcus and Propionibacteriaceae (P. acnes) also
form the main differences between AD temporal tissue and
blood, with Propionibacteriaceae completely absent from the
blood data.
P
. acnes as a Possible Contributing Factor
in Neuroinflammation
P. acnes is a commensal, gram-positive component of the
human skin and mouth microflora that prefers anaerobic growth
conditions and it is becoming increasingly clear that it is a
significant opportunistic pathogen. Most commonly, it has been
associated with post-operative lesions and implanted prostheses,
but, also in chronic diseases such as lumbar region inflammation,
endocarditis, sarcoidosis and in intracranial lesions (Buchanan
et al., 1982; Bhatia et al., 2004; McDowell et al., 2013). Recently
Branton et al. (2016) have shown the presence of Proteobacteria
and Actinobacteria (containing Propionibacteriaceae) in both
normal and multiple sclerosis affected brains; thus, normal
brain has a microbiome consisting largely of Proteobacteria and
Actinobacteria. Our data suggests that Actinobacteria (P. acnes)
increases in AD brain over and above Proteobacteria. The
ability of P. acnes to non-specifically stimulate the innate
immune system is well documented (Tanghetti, 2013): it
secretes chemotactic and proinflammatory cytokine-inducing
factors and can activate complement pathways and produces
hyaluronidases, proteases and neuraminidases, thought to cause
epithelial permeabilization and inflammatory infiltration (Bhatia
et al., 2004). It is interesting to note that P. acnes was cultured
from three out of four biopsies from AD-affected brains
(Kornhuber, 1996). P. acnes is a well-documented contaminant
of NGS techniques as shown by no template controls and of
clinical samples that have unavoidable contact with skin (Lusk,
2014; Salter et al., 2014; Mollerup et al., 2016). However, the
consistently high levels seen here in AD samples compared
to normal brains and the apparent minimal contribution of
post mortem interval along with the lack of significant contact
with skin makes contamination an unlikely explanation for the
P. acnes content of these data. Furthermore, the physiological
characteristics of P. acnes (Buchanan et al., 1982; Bhatia et al.,
2004; McDowell et al., 2013; Tanghetti, 2013), including its
known ability to grow slowly in the cortex (Kornhuber, 1996),
Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

June 2017 | Volume 9 | Article 195
 Emery et al.
NGS of Bacteria in Alzheimer’s Post-Mortem Brain
would make P. acnes a good candidate for a bacterial source of
neuroinflammation in AD brains and the bacterial reads seen
here would warrant further investigation.
The closely related Corynebacteriaceae reported here are only
defined to an uncharacterized culture (and not C. diphtheriae),
but it is perhaps worth noting a report suggesting that
C. diphtheriae is often found in the nasopharynx and that
inoculation against diphtheria may provide protection against
AD (Merril, 2013). Furthermore, Corynebacteriaceae have been
detected by 16S NGS in cerebrospinal fluid from living
individuals (Salzberg et al., 2016).
AD-Associated Neuroinflammation and
Possible Microbial Contributors
These data need to be viewed in the context that the mean
age of the NGS cohort was 81.8 for control and 79.8 for AD.
Immune response is known to be affected by age, with a waning
in function of the adaptive immune system with increasing age
(Weksler et al., 2005; Castelo-Branco and Soveral, 2014) whereas
the innate immune system remains relatively intact, providing
a rapid but short-lived acute defense against pathogens. Half of
all genes upregulated in an age-related manner are associated
with inflammation, oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines
(Prolla, 2002), which is consistent with evidence showing that the
aging innate immune system takes on an ever-greater role against
pathogens; changing from a first line of defense to a chronic,
inflammatory response (Licastro et al., 2005). Consistent with
this, neuroinflammation appears to be both a general age-related
feature in the brain (Lynch, 2010) and, in exaggerated form, as
an important contributor to many age-related neuropathological
diseases (Akiyama et al., 2000a; Heneka et al., 2015a). For
instance, increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukins, IL6 and
IL1β are highly expressed during the early stages of AD
(Sudduth et al., 2013) with levels of TNFα 25-fold higher in
AD cerebrospinal fluid than controls (Tarkowski et al., 1999).
Microglial cells associated with plaques in AD brains (Perlmutter
and Chui, 1990) are an important component of the innate
response, and are activated as a function of age (Norden and
Godbout, 2013). In AD brain this is likely to be a chronic
response to Aβ (Sastre et al., 2006) resulting in localized immune
responses (Akiyama et al., 2000a), production of damaging free
radicals and the assembly of inflammasomes which promote an
escalation of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Malik
et al., 2015). Overproduction or reduced clearance of Aβ may
exacerbate this. Additionally, the integrity of the blood-brain-
barrier (BBB) diminishes, partly with age, increased cytokine
load and in the context of apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4; Bell et al.,
2012).
The evidence for a significant microbial presence in the
human brain is substantial, including pathogens such as fungi
(including yeast; Pisa et al., 2015), herpes simplex virus-1,
HIV, toxoplasma, viroids, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, and
a variety of bacteria (Miklossy, 2011; Mawanda and Wallace,
2013; Harris and Harris, 2015; Olsen and Singhrao, 2016; Zhan
et al., 2016). These could be present as the consequence of an
increased permeability of the BBB. However, since Aβ42 found in
plaques has anti-microbiological activity, protecting against both
bacterial and fungal infections (Soscia et al., 2010; Heneka et al.,
2015a; Kumar et al., 2016; Spitzer et al., 2016) their presence may
be indirect evidence for a microbial-induced neuroinflammatory
response. Aβ42 itself seems to be implicated as part of the
innate immune response to bacterial infection. The observation
that both alpha synuclein and Aβ42 have antimicrobial activity
and that the CsgA (Curli) protein expressed by some bacteria
(as part of their extracellular biofilm matrix) promotes alpha
synuclein fibrillar deposition in the context of Parkinson’s
disease (Chen et al., 2016) may suggest a role for biofilm matrix
components in the propagation of host amyloid fibrillization.
These observations combined with those showing age-related
increase in the permeability of the gastro-intestinal epithelium
(Tran and Greenwood-Van Meerveld, 2013) provide a model of
aging brains under increasing threat from almost every known
type of microbe, which could account for a considerable portion
of age-related neuroinflammation.
Bacteria and AD
Probably the bacteria most frequently described as associated
with
AD
are
those
of
the
oral
microbiome.
Several
epidemiological studies have shown links between tooth loss,
poor oral hygiene and an increased risk of dementia (Gatz et al.,
2006; Stein et al., 2007; Kamer et al., 2009; Paganini-Hill et al.,
2012). Multiple studies have shown up to a seven-fold higher
density of oral bacteria in AD brain tissues compared to normal
(Miklossy and McGeer, 2016). Spirochetes such as Treponema
have been linked to AD (Riviere et al., 2002) and increased
levels of immunoglobulin to P. gingivalis (Sparks Stein et al.,
2012), F. nucleatum and P. intermedia) have all been associated
with cognitive impairment and/or AD (Riviere et al., 2002).
Helicobacter pylori (Miklossy et al., 2006; Kountouras et al., 2014;
Miklossy, 2015) and the spirochete B. burgdorferi (MacDonald
and Miranda, 1987) have also been found. There is also strong
evidence to suggest that the gut microbiome is associated with
pathogenic mechanisms in both Parkinson’s disease (Sampson
et al., 2016) and AD (Minter et al., 2016). In a mouse model
of Parkinson’s disease, the gut microbiome was shown to be
required for pathology as well as characteristic motor deficits
(Sampson et al., 2016). Further to this, in an AD mouse model
with familial AD mutations which produce numerous amyloid
(Aβ) plaques in the brain, antibiotic-related changes in the
gut microbiome resulted in a decrease in plaque load (Minter
et al., 2016). Additionally, changes in the microbiome have been
reported in obesity (Ley et al., 2005; Turnbaugh et al., 2009) and
type 2 diabetes (Qin et al., 2012; Karlsson et al., 2013), each of
which is strongly associated with AD.
Some of the best-documented bacterial species associated with
periodontal disease were not observed in this study (Balin et al.,
2008; Fujii et al., 2009; Dewhirst et al., 2010; Achermann et al.,
2014). However, that these ‘‘missing’’ species could be present
at low copy numbers or in discreet areas not sampled cannot
be discounted; further sampling and NGS-based experiments
exploring more rRNA gene variable regions, different PCR
conditions and systematic analysis of 16S DNA in different areas
of the brain are required in order to provide a fuller assessment.

 Emery et al.
NGS of Bacteria in Alzheimer’s Post-Mortem Brain
There are other considerations also: for instance, the cohort
assessed here was not selected based on periodontal or any other
disease; future studies would require specific cohorts selected
for the presence and absence of periodontal or other disease.
Additionally, any infection, which initiates the neuropathology
of AD, may occur 15–20 years pre-mortem; therefore the bacteria
identified here may be due to secondary infection after BBB
breakdown. In addition, cohorts from different geographical
regions may differ in their gut, mouth and brain microbiomes.
Species vary between global regions and ethnic groups (Rylev
and Kilian, 2008): Spanish periodontitis patients were more
likely to harbor oral P. gingivalis than in Netherlands where A.
actinomycetemcomitans was more evident (Sanz et al., 2000).
Furthermore, whereas up to 90% of North American samples
of AD brains contained C. pneumoniae, in another study from
North European patients, C. pneumoniae could not be detected.
(Gieffers et al., 2000). Likewise, in this study C. pneumoniae was
completely absent, as was E. coli K99 (Zhan et al., 2016) and some
other periodontal species previously associated with AD were
noticeable by their extremely low levels or complete absence; also,
some other non-oral bacterium commonly associated with AD.
SUMMARY
This is a novel comparative pilot study using 16S ribosomal NGS
to assess the bacterial component of the microbiome in frozen
and fixed post-mortem tissue from AD and control temporal
cortex. The study presented here has shown, for the first time,
that 16S NGS in terms of both PCR sensitivity and taxonomic
coverage is extremely well suited to the detection and analysis of
bacterial populations in both frozen and FFPE temporal cortex,
despite background human genomic DNA being present in
overwhelming excess. Although this is only a pilot study with a
limited cohort, these data strongly suggest that AD brains tend
to have strikingly large bacterial loads compared to controls. In
this study, species associated with skin, nasopharyngeal and oral
areas such as Firmicutes and most consistently Actinobacteria,
especially P. acnes (up to 94% of Actinobacteria) are responsible
for this.
