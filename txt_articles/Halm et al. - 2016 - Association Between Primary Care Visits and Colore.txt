BACKGROUND: Population outreach strategies are in-
creasingly used to improve colorectal cancer (CRC)
screening. The influence of primary care on cancer
screening in this context is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between primary
care provider (PCP) visits and receipt of CRC screening
and colonoscopy after a positive fecal immunochemical
(FIT) or fecal occult blood test (FOBT).
DESIGN: Population-based cohort study.
PARTICIPANTS: A total of 968,072 patients ages 50–74
years who were not up to date with CRC screening in 2011
in four integrated healthcare systems (three with screen-
ing outreach programs using FIT kits) in the Population-
Based Research Optimizing Screening through Personal-
ized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium.
MEASURES: Demographic, clinical, PCP visit, and CRC
screening data were obtained from electronic health re-
cords and administrative databases. We examined asso-
ciations between PCP visits in 2011 and receipt of FIT/
FOBT, screening colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy
(CRC screening) in 2012 and follow-up colonoscopy with-
in 3 months of a positive FIT/FOBT in 2012. We used
multivariable logistic regression and propensity score
models to adjust for confounding.
RESULTS: Fifty-eight percent of eligible patients complet-
ed a CRC screening test in 2012, most by FIT. Those with a
greater number of PCP visits had higher rates of CRC
screening at all sites. Patients with ≥1 PCP visit had near-
ly twice the adjusted-odds of CRC screening (OR = 1.88,
95 % CI: 1.86–1.89). Overall, 79.6 % of patients with a
positive FIT/FOBT completed colonoscopy within
3 months. Patients with ≥1 PCP visit had 30 % higher
adjusted odds of completing colonoscopy after positive
FIT/FOBT (OR = 1.30; 95 % CI: 1.22–1.40).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a greater number of PCP
visits had higher rates of both incident CRC screening and
colonoscopy after positive FIT/FOBT, even in health sys-
tems with active population health outreach programs. In
this era of virtual care and population outreach, primary
care visits remain an important mechanism for engaging
patients in cancer screening.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and
the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States.1 Screening can prevent CRC and reduce cancer-
related mortality.2 National guidelines recommend CRC
screening via colonoscopy, flexible sigmoidoscopy, or fecal
immunochemical tests (FIT) or high-sensitivity guaiac occult
blood tests (FOBT).3 Primary care providers (PCP) tradition-
ally initiate cancer screening, and prior work has shown that
patients seen by PCPs are more likely to receive CRC screen-
ing.4–8
However, CRC screening rates remain suboptimal, even
after decades of public health campaigns, public reporting of
health plan CRC screening rates, and implementation of visit-
based preventive service reminders in electronic health records
(EHRs).4,7,9–11 Therefore, a growing number of private and
public health systems are taking a population health perspec-
tive and using outreach approaches to promote CRC screening
that do not require a face-to-face primary care visit.12 Active
outreach strategies, such as mailed invitations for colonoscopy
and/or stool blood testing, can substantially increase screening
rates.9–11 The extent to which primary care continues to play
an important role in CRC screening in health systems with
active population screening outreach programs is unknown.

 While all CRC screening modalities are effective, many
large integrated delivery systems (like health maintenance
organizations, Department of Veterans Affairs, and county
health systems), are actively promoting the FIT/FOBT testing
strategy. FIT/FOBT tests are inexpensive and easy to mail and
distribute, and they may result in higher completion rates than
screening colonoscopy due to a combination of patient accep-
tance, cost, logistics, and system capacity factors.13 However,
the effectiveness of a FIT/FOBT strategy depends on whether
positive tests are followed up with diagnostic colonoscopy.
Given their relationship with patients and repeated contact
with them, PCPs may be instrumental in ensuring that patients
with positive FIT/FOBT tests complete follow-up colonosco-
py.14,15 Thus far, however, this relationship has not been
explored.
This study used a large, clinically detailed dataset from four
integrated delivery systems with varying degrees of CRC
screening population outreach in order to examine associa-
tions between the number of PCP visits and receipt of CRC
screening and follow-up colonoscopy after a positive FIT/
FOBT test.
METHODS
This study was conducted as part of the NCI-funded consor-
tium Population-Based Research Optimizing Screening
through Personalized Regiments (PROSPR).16–18 The overall
aim of PROSPR is to conduct multi-site, coordinated, trans-
disciplinary research to evaluate and improve cancer screening
processes. The ten PROSPR research centers reflect the diver-
sity of US delivery system organizations. This study used data
from four PROSPR CRC sites: Group Health (GH), Kaiser
Permanente Northern California (KPNC), Kaiser Permanente
Southern California (KPSC), and the Parkland Health & Hos-
pital System - University of Texas Southwestern Medical
Center (PHHS-UTSW). The populations and screening prac-
tices of the PROSPR sites have been described previously.17
The four participating systems have different CRC screening
strategies. The two Kaiser Permanente health systems have
active outreach programs that include annual mailing of FIT
kits to patients not up to date with screening, supplemented by
distribution of FIT kits in other settings (e.g. vaccination
appointments), and system-level follow-up of positive FIT/
FOBT results. GH sends patients receiving primary care at GH
medical centers an annual preventive services reminder letter
that includes CRC screening. The PHHS-UTSW safety-net
health system does not have a screening outreach program.
Study Population
The study cohort included men and women 50–89 years of age
enrolled from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012. For the
three health plans (KPNC, KPSC, and GH), individuals en-
tered the cohort if they were enrolled from 2011 through 2012,
independent of health care utilization after health plan
enrollment. PHHS-UTSW is an integrated delivery system
that is the sole safety-net provider for low-income Dallas
County residents who are uninsured or under-insured. Because
PHHS-UTSW is not a health plan with distinct members, it
enrolled patients who were 50–64 years of age who had a
primary care visit at any of its 12 community-based clinics
during 2010. There was no requirement for any subsequent
health care visits. The PHHS-UTSW cohort was restricted to
ages 50–64 years, because most patients become eligible for
Medicare at age 65 and may receive care outside the safety-net
system.
For this study, we focused on individuals continuously
enrolled from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2012,
who were not up to date with CRC screening as of January 1,
2012. We examined associations between the number of PCP
visits in 2011 and subsequent CRC screening activity in 2012.
Screening status of not up to date was assessed using data in
the EHRs and administrative databases, and was defined as no
colonoscopy in 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy in 5 years, or
FIT/FOBT in the 2 prior years (to provide a liberal time
window around the annual FIT/FOBT testing strategy). We
excluded individuals with prior CRC or partial or total
colectomy. All activities were approved by the institutional
review boards at each PROSPR site and the Statistical Coor-
dinating Center.
Outcome Measures
Our two primary CRC screening outcomes were as follows: 1)
incident screening, defined as receipt of CRC screening in
2012 among individuals not up to date as of January 1, 2012;
and 2) completion of screening, defined as follow-up colonos-
copy within 3 months after a positive FIT/FOBT in 2012.
CRC screening was defined as completion of a FIT/FOBT,
flexible sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy for screening pur-
poses based on data from EHRs and administrative data-
bases.19,20 The vast majority of stool blood tests were FITs.
We excluded in-office FOBTs, which are not recommended
for screening. In order to ascertain diagnostic colonoscopy, we
restricted analyses of follow-up after positive FIT/FOBT to
patients with follow-up time of at least 3 months after the
positive result, a time by which the majority of follow-up
diagnostic colonoscopies were completed.18 Similar results
were found in sensitivity analyses among individuals with at
least 6 months of follow-up time after the positive result.
Independent Variables
The main predictor variable was the number of primary care
visits in 2011 based on EHR and administrative data, and
categorized as 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4+ visits in 2011, as well as no
visits vs. any visit in 2011. Primary care visits were ambula-
tory encounters with a clinician in general internal medicine,
family medicine, primary care, community health, geriatrics,
or women’s health. We were not able to systematically link
screening tests to a specific primary care visit (because of
1191

 widespread outreach distribution of FIT tests at the two largest
sites), so we examined associations between the number of
primary care visits in 2011 and subsequent CRC screening
outcomes completed in 2012. Key covariates included age,
sex, race/ethnicity, insurance status, and Charlson comorbidity
score (0, 1, 2, or 3+) in 2011.21
Statistical Analyses
We examined associations between the number of pri-
mary care visits in 2011 and CRC screening outcomes
in 2012 (incident screening and timely follow-up colo-
noscopy after positive FIT/FOBT) using chi-square tests
and logistic regression. We report associations across all
sites combined as well as stratified by health system.
We used a propensity-score approach to account for
differences between patients with and without any PCP
visits. We used logistic regression to estimate the prob-
ability of having a PCP visit in 2011 based on their age
(in 5-year intervals), sex, race/ethnicity, type of health
insurance, comorbidity score, and months in the health
system prior to cohort entry.22–24 Propensity scores were
estimated separately for each site, because of substantial
differences in patient, provider, and system factors
predicting PCP use in each health system. Propensity
score weights were obtained as the inverse of the prob-
ability of the observed PCP visit status and normalized
to sum to N. The propensity scores had good discrimi-
nation, overlap, and balance of covariates.22–24 The c-
statistics for the site-specific propensity scores ranged
from 0.68 to 0.78. Site-specific weights were employed
as inverse probability weights for analyses with all sites
combined. Logistic regression was used to assess asso-
ciations between number of PCP visits and CRC screen-
ing outcomes using site-specific, propensity score-
adjusted results. Alternate models adjusting for the pro-
pensity score as a continuous variable or by deciles
produced similar findings. The combined-site logistic
regression models also adjusted for health system. Sen-
sitivity analyses using multivariable regression to adjust
associations for covariates (age, sex, race/ethnicity, in-
surance, comorbidity, and site) produced findings similar
to those of the propensity-adjusted models (see Online
Tables S1 and S2). Analyses used SAS software version

RESULTS
Our study population included 968,072 individuals in four
health systems who were not up to date with CRC screening
in 2011. Characteristics of study patients are presented in
Table 1. The average age was 59.2 years, and slightly more
than half were women. The population was racially and eth-
nically diverse, with 51.7 % non-Hispanic white, 19.0 %
Hispanic, 12.3 % Asian, and 8.2 % black individuals. Almost
one-third of patients had at least one comorbid condition.
Sociodemographic characteristics of patients differed substan-
tially among sites, based on differences in geography and
socioeconomic status of the populations served. Compared
to the three insured health plans, patients at Parkland-UTSW
were younger, had higher comorbidity scores, and were more
likely to be non-white. Across all sites, there was wide varia-
tion in the number of annual primary care visits, with 23.6 %
having no visits and over half having two or more visits in
2011.
Associations Between Primary Care Visits
and Incident CRC Screening
Overall, 58.1 % of those not up to date in 2011 completed a
CRC screening test in 2012 (Table 2). The vast majority of
screening tests (94 %) were FIT/FOBTs; 5 % were colonos-
copies, and <1 % were flexible sigmoidoscopies. Incident
screening rates were highest at KPNC (67.2 %) and lowest
in the safety-net setting (Parkland-UTSW, 18.3 %). In unad-
justed analyses, a greater number of primary care visits in 2011
was associated with higher CRC screening rates in 2012
(Table 2). While absolute rates of incident screening differed
by site, the association between primary care visits and screen-
ing was similar in settings with and without organized out-
reach. This was driven predominantly by a higher proportion
of persons with ≥1 PCP visit having been screened (vs. those
with no visits; OR = 2.34, 95 % CI: 2.32–2.36, Table 2). The
higher odds of CRC screening among those with at least one
primary care visit was seen across all sites, including those
with the most intensive screening outreach (KPNC, KPSC).
A larger number of primary care visits was associated
with higher rates of screening in propensity-adjusted anal-
yses (Table 3). Compared to individuals with no PCP
visits, those with ≥1 visit had nearly double the risk-
adjusted odds of screening (OR = 1.88, 95 % CI: 1.86–
1.89). This association was seen in all health systems. We
found similar patterns in alternate covariate-adjusted
models (Online Table S1).
Associations Between Primary Care Visits
and Follow-Up Colonoscopy After a Positive
FIT/FOBT
Overall, 79.6 % of patients with a positive FIT/FOBT
underwent diagnostic colonoscopy within the following
3 months (Table 4). Both unadjusted (Table 4) and
propensity-adjusted analyses (Table 5) showed that patients
with a greater number of PCP visits were more likely to
complete a colonoscopy following a positive FIT/FOBT, with
the exception of those at PHHS-UTSW. Due to small cell
sizes, we could not construct reliable estimates for Parkland-
UTSW. In all sites combined, patients with ≥1 PCP visit had
30 % higher adjusted odds of following up a positive FIT
(OR = 1.30, CI: 1.22–1.40). Alternate covariate-adjusted
models demonstrated a similar association.

 DISCUSSION
In this study of nearly one million patients in four large integrated
delivery systems, we found that patients with a greater number of
PCP visits had higher subsequent rates of CRC screening, as well
as higher rates of follow-up colonoscopy after a positive FIT/
FOBT. Those with ≥1 PCP visit had nearly double the adjusted
odds of completing an initial CRC screening test, and 30 %
increased adjusted odds of having a colonoscopy after a positive
FIT/FOBT. We expected to find a strong association between
visits and CRC screening in the safety net health system (PHHS-
UTSW) without a screening outreach program, because cancer
screening is traditionally initiated by PCPs. Interestingly, we
found a similar correlation in the health plans (KPNC and KPSC)
that did extensive population health outreach with distribution of
FIT/FOBT kits in multiple care settings not requiring patients to
have a traditional ambulatory visit to initiate screening. This was
also the case at the site (GH) that did an intermediate amount of
outreach, with annual prevention mailings.
There are several possible explanations for these associa-
tions. First, offering CRC screening to patients who are not
up to date is a standard component of both the annual wellness
exam and health care maintenance discussions during chronic
disease management visits. Therefore, a PCP visit can directly
result in FIT/FOBT or colonoscopy being ordered. Second,
since many patients express initial reluctance to have a colo-
noscopy or do a stool blood test, multiple discussions over time
may be necessary for them to complete a test. Therefore, the
greater the number of PCP visits, the greater the chance that a
declined/non-completed FIT/FOBT or declined/missed colo-
noscopy is reordered. Third, even though CRC screening can
be triggered via population outreach interventions (independent
of an office visit), we hypothesize that prior primary care
discussions might have primed patients' knowledge about and
willingness to complete a mailed FIT/FOBT kit or schedule a
colonoscopy in response to a reminder letter. This may be
similar to the multiple discussions needed before someone will
take action to quit smoking or lose weight.26,27 Fourth, patients
who are more prevention-oriented may be more likely both to
have regular PCP visits and to complete cancer screening.
The similar pattern observed for colonoscopy after a positive
FOBT/FIT, even in the setting of the large health plans (KPNC,
KPSC) that have strong systems in place to automatically follow
up positive stool tests (independent of PCP intervention), could
have several explanations. It may reflect Bpriming^ by their PCP
that a positive FIT/FOBT would require a follow-up colonosco-
py. Conversely, patients who are more prevention-oriented may
be both more motivated to follow up abnormal screening tests
and more engaged in primary care.

 Previous research in primary care settings5,6,28 and the
general population4,8 that have examined predictors of CRC
screening have focused primarily on Bprevalent^ screening
(having ever been screened) and in settings where colonosco-
py (which offers 10 years of protection) was the predominant
screening modality. These studies showed that PCP visits4–8
and physician recommendation were strong predictors of prev-
alent CRC screening (mostly with colonoscopy).2,6,8 Our
study extends prior work by demonstrating an independent
association between prior primary care visits and subsequent
Bincident^ CRC screening, including outreach screening not
linked directly to the primary care visit. This work is particu-
larly important in the modern era, where large private and
public health systems have extensive CRC screening outreach
programs and are promoting annual FIT/FOBT as a dominant
strategy. Since an FIT/FOBT testing strategy is effective only
if performed annually, a better understanding of the determi-
nants of Bincident^ (not just Bprevalent^) CRC screening is
critical. Furthermore, no prior study has shown that PCP visits
are associated with colonoscopy after a positive FIT/FOBT.
This is relevant because health systems using FIT/FOBT
outreach strategies often have organized navigation to follow
up positive tests.
The diversity and size of our study population is also a
strength. We assessed the association between PCP visits and
CRC screening among a cohort of nearly one million patients
across a broad range of ages and health systems, in contrast to
studies only in the elderly or among Medicare or VA

 beneficiaries.29 The study population was also diverse with
regard to sex, race, ethnicity, and insurance coverage, and
cared for in four geographically and administratively distinct
regional delivery systems. The associations we report were
robust after controlling for the likelihood of having a PCP
visit, as well as in secondary analyses that adjusted for other
patient factors known to influence screening and primary care
utilization such as age, sex, race, ethnicity, education, and
insurance.4,30,31
Our study is limited by the observational nature of the data
available for analysis. The majority of patients had commer-
cial or Medicare insurance. However, we found similar asso-
ciations in the UTSW-Parkland cohort of low-income patients
in a public safety-net health system. Nevertheless, all four sites
represented integrated delivery systems, so patterns of care
and rates of CRC screening and follow-up of abnormal tests,
while not optimal, are likely to be higher than those in less
organized settings. There may be some misclassification of
individuals identified as not up to date with CRC screening
due to limited data prior to health system enrollment and
variation in site-specific algorithms used to identify prior
screening colonoscopies.19,20 In addition, we did not have

 information about screening test orders, including what ulti-
mately prompted testing (e.g. provider visit, outreach invita-
tion) or test follow-up, so we were unable to trace the mech-
anism through which primary care improved outcomes. For
the two largest sites, KPNC and KPSC, given their extensive
outreach to persons not up to date with screening, it should be
assumed that the vast majority of their patients were exposed
to FIT screening invitations. While our propensity score anal-
yses adjusted for observable differences between individuals
who did and did not seek primary care, such patients could
have varied in unmeasured ways. We also do not know the
reason for the PCP visit or whether CRC screening was
explicitly discussed during the visit.
From a policy perspective, our findings suggest that prima-
ry care visits may be an important mechanism for engaging
patients in cancer screening, even in settings with structured
outreach programs. This may reflect the diminishing impact of
outreach as patients are exposed to an increasing number of
mailings and phone calls from provider organizations seeking
to close preventive care gaps. In order to ensure success, it will
be important for outreach programs to seek opportunities to
reference and leverage existing primary care relationships,
rather than replacing them. This may be especially useful for
processes such as CRC screening, for which there are numer-
ous patient and system barriers to completion, such that mul-
tiple reminders, encouragement, and facilitating steps are often
needed. PCPs working in health systems that have outreach
programs should continue to discuss evidence-based cancer
screening with their patients, and should not rely solely on
population health programs to close preventive care gaps. For
health systems where baseline CRC screening and follow-up
rates are low, FIT outreach programs followed by intensive
navigation for positive tests may also be needed to improve
screening rates, and represent an important area for future
study.
In conclusion, even among organized, integrated delivery
systems with insured patients and widespread population-
based CRC screening outreach and follow-up programs that
do not require a face-to-face visit, engagement in primary care
was associated with higher rates of incident CRC screening
and follow-up colonoscopy after a positive FIT/FOBT. Thus,
in this brave new world of virtual care, an old-fashioned
primary care visit still appears to be important in ensuring
successful cancer screening.
