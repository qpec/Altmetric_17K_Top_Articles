ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effectiveness of combining 
mirtazapine with serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake 
inhibitor (SNRI) or selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants for treatment 
resistant depression in primary care.
DESIGN
Two parallel group multicentre phase III randomised 
placebo controlled trial.
SETTING
106 general practices in four UK sites; Bristol, Exeter, 
Hull, and Keele/North Staffs, August 2013 to October 
2015.
PARTICIPANTS
480 adults aged 18 or more years who scored 14 
or more on the Beck depression inventory, second 
revision, fulfilled ICD-10 (international classification 
of diseases, 10th revision) criteria for depression, 
and had used an SSRI or SNRI for at least six weeks 
but were still depressed. 241 were randomised 
to mirtazapine and 239 to placebo, both given in 
addition to usual SSRI or SNRI treatment. Participants 
were stratified by centre and minimised by baseline 
Beck depression inventory score, sex, and current 
psychological therapy. They were followed up at 12, 
24, and 52 weeks. 431 (89.8%) were included in the 
(primary) 12 week follow-up.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Depressive symptoms at 12 weeks after 
randomisation, measured using the Beck depression 
inventory II score as a continuous variable. Secondary 
outcomes included measures of anxiety, quality of life, 
and adverse effects at 12, 24, and 52 weeks.
RESULTS
Beck depression inventory II scores at 12 weeks were 
lower in the mirtazapine group after adjustment for 
baseline scores and minimisation or stratification 
variables, although the confidence interval included 
the null (mean (SD) scores at 12 weeks: 18.0 (12.3) 
in the mirtazapine group, 19.7 (12.4) in the placebo 
group; adjusted difference between means −1.83 
(95% confidence interval −3.92 to 0.27); P=0.09). 
Adverse effects were more common in the mirtazapine 
group and were associated with the participants 
stopping the trial drug.
CONCLUSION
This study did not find evidence of a clinically 
important benefit for mirtazapine in addition to an 
SSRI or SNRI over placebo in a treatment resistant 
group of primary care patients with depression. This 
remains an area of important unmet need where 
evidence of effective treatment options is limited.
TRIAL REGISTRATION
Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN06653773.
Introduction
Depression is among the top five contributors to the 
global burden of disease, and by 2030 is predicted 
to be the leading cause of disability in high income 
countries.1 People with depression in the United 
Kingdom are usually managed in primary care, and 
antidepressants are often the first line treatment. The 
number of prescriptions for antidepressants has risen 
dramatically in recent years in the National Health 
Service, increasing by 6.8% (3.9 million items) during 
2014-15 (total 61 million items).2 Many patients, 
however, do not respond to treatment. The STAR*D 
study (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve 
Depression) found that half of those treated failed 
to experience at least a 50% reduction in depressive 
symptoms after 12-14 weeks of treatment with a 
single antidepressant.3 A substantial proportion 
of those who take antidepressants in an adequate 
dose and for an adequate period do not experience 
a clinically meaningful improvement in depressive 
symptoms.3
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC
Half of those in primary care who take antidepressants remain depressed despite 
adhering to treatment
There is a pharmacological rationale for adding mirtazapine, an antidepressant 
with a different and complementary mode of action, to the widely prescribed 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and serotonin and noradrenaline 
reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants—evidence from several small studies 
suggests that this combination might be effective
It was important to study this in primary care where most depression is 
diagnosed and managed, and this combination is used with increasing frequency
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
This study did not find evidence of a clinically important benefit for mirtazapine 
in addition to an SSRI or SNRI over placebo in primary care patients with 
treatment resistant depression
Those who took mirtazapine were more likely to experience adverse effects and 
to stop treatment
These findings challenge the growing practice of the addition of mirtazapine to 
SSRI or SNRI in this group of patients

The National Institute for Health and Care 
Excellence advises general practitioners to reconsider 
treatment if patients show no response after 4-6 weeks 
of antidepressant use.4 Limited evidence is currently 
available to guide doctors in the management of patients 
who meet the ICD-10 (international classification of 
diseases, 10th revision) criteria for depression after 
taking a serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor 
(SNRI) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) 
at an adequate dose for a minimum of six weeks.5 
Several drug strategies have been proposed, including 
increasing the dose, switching antidepressants, 
combining two antidepressants, and augmenting the 
antidepressant with another psychotropic drug, such 
as lithium or an antipsychotic.6 A systematic review 
of antidepressant combinations for those who did not 
respond to monotherapy found that the small number 
of trials and methodological drawbacks of those trials 
precluded definitive conclusions about effectiveness, 
and some of the combinations carry a substantial risk of 
adverse effects and are not considered appropriate for 
initiation in primary care.7 There is a pharmacological 
rationale for adding a second antidepressant with 
a different and complementary mode of action to 
SSRIs or SNRIs. Mirtazapine, a noradrenaline (α2 
adrenoreceptor) and serotonin (5 hydroxtryptamine 
receptors 2 and 3) antagonist, has the potential for an 
additive and perhaps synergistic action with SSRIs and 
SNRIs and could enhance clinical response compared 
with monotherapy with SSRIs or SNRIs. Four trials have 
been carried out of this combination against SSRI and 
SNRI monotherapy in participants who are treatment 
resistant and in those without treatment failure, with 
mixed results.8-11
We 
determined 
the 
effectiveness 
of 
adding 
mirtazapine to an SSRI or SNRI in reducing depressive 
symptoms and improving quality of life at 12 weeks 
(primary follow-up) and at 24 and 52 weeks compared 
with adding placebo for patients in primary care who 
still experience depression after an adequate course of 
treatment.
Methods
Study design and participants
The MIR Study was a two parallel group multicentre 
pragmatic placebo controlled randomised trial with 
allocation at the level of the individual. We recruited 
participants from general practices in areas surrounding 
the four centres of Bristol, Exeter, Hull, and Keele/
North Staffs. Eligible participants were aged 18 years 
or more, had used an SSRI or SNRI antidepressant at 
an adequate dose for at least six weeks, were adherent 
to treatment, had a Beck depression inventory, second 
revision (BDI II) score of 14 or more,12 and fulfilled the 
ICD-10 criteria for depression. We excluded patients 
with bipolar disorder, psychosis, major alcohol or 
substance misuse, a diagnosis of dementia, and an 
inability to complete the questionnaires, and women 
who were pregnant, breast feeding, or planning 
pregnancy.
We used a three stage recruitment process to identify 
potential participants. Staff at general practices 
searched their computerised records to identify 
patients who had received repeated prescriptions for 
an antidepressant during the previous four months 
and were being prescribed an antidepressant at an 
adequate dose. Doctors screened this list of patients 
and excluded those on the basis of the study eligibility 
criteria. Potentially eligible participants received a 
letter of invitation and brief information about the 
study, seeking permission for the research team to 
contact them. Doctors could also invite patients during 
a consultation to take part in the study, in which case 
the doctor provided information about the study and 
obtained permission to pass contact details to the 
research team. Those who agreed to be contacted were 
sent a postal questionnaire. This included questions 
about their depressive symptoms (BDI II) and use of 
antidepressants.
To ascertain eligibility a researcher telephoned 
those who met the initial criteria of severity of 
depressive symptoms and adherence to an adequate 
dose of an antidepressant for at least six weeks. Face 
to face baseline assessments were then conducted in 
the participants’ own homes, at their general practices, 
or at nearby National Health Service or university 
premises. Only those patients who fulfilled ICD-10 
criteria (category F32) for their current depressive 
episode (assessed using the revised clinical interview 
schedule),13 had a BDI II score of 14 or more and who 
were continuing to take the prescribed antidepressants 
at an adequate dose were eligible to participate in the 
trial.

Randomisation and masking
Those who were eligible and gave written informed 
consent were randomised to either one 15 mg capsule 
of mirtazapine daily for two weeks followed by two 15 
mg capsules of mirtazapine for up to 50 weeks, or to 
identical placebo.
Randomisation was by means of a computer 
generated code, ensuring that allocation was concealed 
from the recruiting researcher. Randomisation was 
stratified by centre and minimised on baseline BDI II 
score (mild <26, moderate 26-34, or severe ≥35), sex 
(men or women), and current receipt of psychological 
services (yes or no).
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Authority approved the labelling of the drug packs. 
Each pack had an identification number, randomly 
generated to ensure that mirtazapine and placebo 
packs were indistinguishable to maintain allocation 
concealment. 
The 
Bristol 
Randomised 
Trials 
Collaboration generated the random numbers for the 
manufacturer. Participants and doctors were advised 
to use other serotonergic drugs with caution, such as 
tramadol or the triptan group of drugs.
Participants were free to stop taking the study drug at 
any time. Participants, clinicians, outcome assessors, 
and the research team were blinded to allocation. 
After the primary follow-up at 12 weeks, participants 
were offered the opportunity to be unblinded. This 
was not in the original protocol but was required by 
the research ethics committee to ensure that those 
who had not improved had the option of reviewing 
their treatment. Those who elected to be unblinded no 
longer received the trial drug, but outcome measures 
continued to be collected. Participants continued with 
care through their doctor and usual antidepressants. 
Clinicians were not restricted in referring their patients 
to psychological services.
Procedures
Participants were followed up at 6, 12, 24, and 
52 weeks. To maximise response rates, follow-up 
assessments at 12, 24, and 52 weeks were conducted 
at a face-to-face appointment with a researcher. If this 
was not possible then questionnaires were posted or 
administered over the phone.
The primary outcome was BDI II score at 12 weeks 
after randomisation, measured as a continuous 
variable, adjusted for baseline. We aimed to recruit 200 
participants in each group, giving 91% power to detect 
a difference of 0.33 standard deviations at a two sided 
5% significance level. This would be equivalent to a 
between group difference of 3 or 4 points on the BDI 
II, reported to be a clinically important difference.14 
Allowing for 15% loss to follow-up at 12 weeks, we 
planned to recruit 472 participants.
Secondary outcomes were: response, defined as at 
least a 50% reduction in BDI II score compared with 
baseline; remission, defined as a score of less than 
10 on the BDI II; depression using the patient health 
questionnaire (PHQ-9),15 a brief measure included 
because it is widely used in primary care: anxiety 
symptoms measured with the generalised anxiety 
disorder (GAD-7)16 assessment; adverse effects using 
the antidepressant side effect checklist17; quality 
of life measured using the EQ-5D-5L18; social and 
physical functioning using SF-1219; and adherence 
to antidepressants using a four item self report 
measure.20 Secondary outcomes were measured at 12, 
24 (excluding antidepressant side effect checklist), and 
52 weeks, with adjustments for baseline scores where 
appropriate. Cost effectiveness data will be presented 
in a separate publication.
Statistical analysis
Analysis and reporting were in line with CONSORT21 
guidelines based on a prespecified statistical analysis 
plan approved by the trial steering committee.22 Primary 
analyses compared the two groups as randomised, 
without imputing missing values. Depending on the 
type of outcome variable (continuous or binary), we 
used linear or logistic regression models to compare 
the groups as randomised, adjusting for stratification 
and minimisation variables and (where available) the 
corresponding baseline value.
Secondary analyses of the primary and secondary 
outcomes included additional adjustment for variables 
showing noticeable imbalance at baseline (ascertained 
using descriptive statistics).
In the analyses, we present regression coefficients (or 
odds ratios for binary outcomes), with 95% confidence 
intervals and P values. Effect sizes are presented for the 
BDI II outcomes and are calculated based on Cohen’s 
d statistic.
In prespecified subgroup analyses we introduced 
appropriate interaction terms into the regression 
models to investigate differential effects according 
to baseline severity of depression (BDI II), and we 
carried out a multilevel measure of degree of treatment 
resistance based on duration of symptoms and previous 
treatment with antidepressants. This latter variable 
was categorised as: not prescribed antidepressants 
in the past; prescribed antidepressants in the past, 
and depressed for less than one year; prescribed 
antidepressants in the past and depressed for one or 
two years; and prescribed antidepressants in the past 
and depressed for more than two years.
To assess the robustness of our primary analysis, 
we carried out sensitivity analyses. These included 
per protocol analyses of the primary outcome at 
12 and 52 weeks and, since these were likely to be 
biased, a complier average causal effect analysis at 
12, 24, and 52 weeks.23 In this analysis we defined 
participants who adhered to treatment as those who 
had continued taking their trial drug up until 12 
weeks. An additional sensitivity analysis at 24 and 52 
weeks examined between group differences in BDI II 
score in those who remained blinded throughout the 
trial. We also investigated the influence of missing 
data by performing analyses of the primary outcome 
under different assumptions: “best” and “worst” 
case scenarios (representing the lowest and highest 
possible BDI II scores) and multiple imputation by

chained equation to impute missing data.24 When 
using this equation, we generated 25 datasets, and we 
undertook 10 switching procedures. The imputation 
model included all variables predictive of missingness 
as well as variables used in the primary analysis.
Analyses were performed using Stata v14.25
Patient and public involvement
Patient and service user groups from Bristol 
and Manchester (PRIMER) were involved in the 
development of the full application and commented 
on the plain English summary. All of them said that 
they recognised the value of the trial and offered 
advice about recruitment strategies. The Research 
Materials Advisory Service of the West Hub Mental 
Health Research Network (now Clinical Research 
Network) worked with the trial team to develop 
patient information materials and consent forms. A 
panel of service users reviewed the study documents 
before they were sent for ethical approval. A patient 
representative sat on the trial steering committee. A 
patient group met regularly to contribute to the nested 
qualitative study; this group advised on topic guides, 
contributed to analysis of the qualitative datasets, and 
advised on dissemination activities.
Results
The screening process started on 1 August 2013, and 
the final participant was randomised to the trial on 
6 October 2015. The follow-up data were collected 
between August 2015 and the end of October 2016. 
Of 856 patients identified as potentially eligible and 
invited to attend a baseline appointment, 105 (12%) 
declined. Those who declined were comparable 
to attenders on age, sex, and home ownership but 
were less likely to be educated to A level or above 
(31% v 48%). At baseline, one patient was eligible 
but declined, one was alcohol dependent, one had 
recently had the dose of antidepressant altered, and 
268 did not satisfy the ICD-10 criteria for a major 
depressive episode or had a BDI II score less than 14, 
or both. A total of 480 participants were randomised 
(mirtazapine and SSRI or SNRI: n=241; placebo and 
SSRI or SNRI n=239); 431 (90%) were followed up at 
12 weeks, 403 (84%) at 24 weeks, and 390 (81%) at 
52 weeks (fig 1).
The two groups had similar baseline characteristics, 
but some evidence showed that participants in the 
mirtazapine group had more severe depression 
(table 1). Participants randomised to mirtazapine 
were more likely to have a history of depression, and 
a higher proportion had had suicidal thoughts in the 
past.
At 12 weeks, the mean BDI II score in those 
randomised to the usual care and mirtazapine group 
was 18.0 (SD 12.3) compared with 19.7 (12.4) in 
those randomised to usual care and placebo (table 2). 
A small difference in favour of the intervention was 
found after adjustment for baseline BDI II score and 
the stratification and minimisation variables, site, 
baseline thirds of BDI II score, sex, and whether the 
participant was receiving psychological therapy at 
baseline. The confidence interval included the null; it 
is therefore possible that the two treatment groups did 
not differ (adjusted difference in means −1.83, 95% 
confidence interval −3.92 to 0.27, P=0.09); table 2). 
Slightly larger differences were observed in a per 
protocol and complier average causal effect analyses 
(see supplementary table A1). Further adjustment for 
characteristics showing an imbalance at baseline did 
not materially affect the results of the primary analysis 
(see supplementary table A2).
At 24 and 52 weeks, the adjusted difference in 
BDI II score between the two groups was smaller 
and included the null (24 weeks: adjusted difference 
in means −0.85 (−3.12 to 1.43); 52 weeks: adjusted 
difference in means 0.17 (−2.13 to 2.46); table 2). 
Adopting per protocol and complier average causal 
effect approaches to analysis of these outcomes 
yielded similar or slightly larger differences (see 
supplementary table A1).
Participants were able to request unblinding after 
the primary outcome at 12 weeks. The results in table 2 
at 24 and 52 weeks include all those who remained in 
the trial, unblinded or not. Eighty three participants in 
the mirtazapine group and 103 in the placebo group 
requested unblinding by 52 weeks. A sensitivity 
analysis at 24 and 52 weeks found no between group 
differences in BDI II score among those who remained 
blinded throughout the trial (see supplementary 
table A3).
The between group differences in all the secondary 
outcome scores at 12 weeks were in favour of the 
intervention, including a second measure of depressive 
symptoms, 
the 
patient 
health 
questionnaire-9. 
However, the differences were small, and in almost 
every case (apart from the GAD-7, which measures 
anxiety symptoms, and the mental health component 
of the SF-12) the confidence interval for the difference 
included the null (table 3). Adherence to the trial drug 
was substantially lower in the intervention group 
compared with placebo group (table 3). Outcomes 
at later time points showed smaller between group 
differences (see supplementary table A4).
No between group difference was found for adverse 
effects using the antidepressant side effect checklist 
at 12 weeks (table 3). We also collected spontaneous 
participant reports of adverse effects. In the first 12 
weeks most reported adverse effects were minor. 
Eleven serious adverse events resulted in hospital 
admission, of which eight occurred in the intervention 
group (see supplementary table A5). More patients in 
the intervention group reported non-serious adverse 
effects, and 46 participants reporting adverse effects in 
this group stopped their drug compared with nine in 
the placebo group (table 4).
We compared our analyses of the primary outcome 
using complete cases with analyses that tackled 
missing data. The findings using complete cases 
seemed to be robust to various assumptions about 
missing data (see supplementary table A6).

We found no evidence that either of the two 
preplanned subgroup analyses had any effect on 
the difference between the mirtazapine and placebo 
groups (P=0.101 for interaction with treatment 
group for baseline depression severity: P=0.30 
for interaction with treatment group for treatment 
resistance).
Discussion
This study did not find convincing evidence of a 
clinically important benefit for mirtazapine over 
placebo when given in addition to an SSRI or SNRI 
antidepressant for patients who had remained 
depressed after at least six weeks of antidepressant 
treatment, recruited from primary care.
In the primary analysis at 12 weeks, the placebo group 
improved from a baseline Beck depression inventory, 
second revision (BDI II) score of 30.6 to a mean of 19.7 
and the intervention group from a baseline BDI II score 
of 31.5 to a mean of 18.0. We based our sample size 
calculation on detecting a between group difference 
equivalent to 3 or 4 BDI II points, which we considered 
would be clinically important. The adjusted difference 
(in means) between the groups after 12 weeks was less 
than this, at −1.83 (95% confidence interval −3.92 
to 0.27, P=0.09) points on the BDI II in favour of the 
intervention group. Although the lower limit of the 
95% confidence interval for this difference includes 
the possibility of a clinically meaningful effect, the 
confidence interval also includes the null and the most 
likely (mean) effect is small, making clinical benefit 
unlikely.
Similar observations of small differences between 
the treatment groups in favour of the mirtazapine 
group were observed for the secondary outcomes at 
12 weeks, but for most outcomes the 95% confidence 
intervals surrounding the difference between groups 
included the null. This weak evidence of a small effect 
at 12 weeks is supported by changes in favour of the 
intervention group in the SF-12 aggregate mental 
health score (between group difference 3.91, 95% 
confidence interval 1.63 to 6.20) and generalised 
anxiety disorder-7 (−0.98, −1.93 to −0.03) where 
confidence intervals did not include the null, although 
the clinical importance of these small differences is not 
clear. Outcomes at later time points showed smaller 
between group differences with no evidence of benefit 
over the longer term. Complier average causal effect 
and per protocol analyses for the primary outcome, 
designed to estimate treatment effects in those who 
complied with their allocated treatment, showed 
slightly larger between group differences than the 
primary analyses, but these were still consistent with 
a chance observation, and per protocol analyses are 
known to be biased. Prespecified subgroup analyses 
based on severity and degree of treatment resistance 
did not yield any evidence of effect modification.
In the mirtazapine group, 46 participants who 
reported adverse effects stopped their drug compared 
with nine in the placebo group. Adherence was 
therefore substantially lower in the mirtazapine 
group than placebo group and is likely to have been 
a consequence of adverse effects. Although the two 
groups did not differ in their rating of adverse effects 
using the antidepressant side effect checklist scale, 
this may be in part due to the lower rate of adherence 
to the trial drug in the intervention group. The number 
of serious adverse events was small in both groups, 
and none were directly attributable to the intervention.

Strengths and weaknesses of this study
Participants, investigators, and assessors were blind 
to the allocation up to and including the primary 
outcome at 12 weeks. Follow-up rates throughout the 
trial were good at all sites, with overall follow-up rates 
of 90% at 12 weeks, 84% at 24 weeks, and 81% at 52 
weeks. Sensitivity analyses were done to assess the 
impact of missing data on the analysis of the primary 
outcome. Whether the missing data were estimated 
under the assumption of a best or worst case scenario 
or using multiple imputation, the observed difference 
in BDI II scores at 12 weeks between treatment groups 
was small. Some minor baseline imbalances existed 
between the two groups but adjustment for these did 
not materially affect the results.
The criteria for defining inadequate response to 
treatment that we adopted have been used elsewhere 
in primary care research20 and were designed to be 
inclusive while reflecting treatment guidelines from the 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence.4 Our 
approach accords with the Maudsley staging method, 
where treatment failure after an adequate dose of an 
antidepressant for six weeks is an important starting 
point on a continuum of treatment failure.27 The 
authors point out that in addition to treatment failure, 
severity and duration of depression are important 
dimensions of treatment resistance. Nearly all (90%) 
of our participants had been taking an antidepressant 
for at least six months, and the range of symptom 
severity in our sample was evenly spread between mild 
to moderate, moderate to severe, and severe groups. In 
addition, most participants reported previous episodes 
of depression. Hence the population recruited to the 
study is representative of the group for whom there is 
uncertainty around ongoing management in primary 
care.
We based our view of the minimal clinically 
important difference between intervention and placebo 
groups of 3 or 4 points in BDI II score on previous 
recommendations from NICE.4 Since the writing of our 
protocol an approach towards establishing minimal 
clinically important difference using self rated global 
ratings of improvement has been developed.14 This 
approach gives an estimate of a minimal clinically 
important difference in depression of 17.5% reduction 
in BDI II score for a depressed primary care population 
but suggests that the minimal clinically important 
difference is higher, at 32% in a non-responsive 
population similar to that studied here. This translates 
to differences of 3.5 and 5.9 BDI II points, respectively. 
It therefore seems unlikely that mirtazapine would 
provide a clinically important benefit, although there 
is still considerable uncertainty around the clinically 
important difference in treatment outcome for this 
group of patients.
Comparison to other studies
Two earlier small studies, one of which was in 
treatment resistant patients8 and one in those who 
had responded to previous treatment9, reported that 
mirtazapine in combination with an SSRI gave a greater 
improvement than monotherapy. A further recent study 
also reported benefit in non-resistant patients and that 
mirtazapine was well tolerated in combination with 
either an SSRI or venlafaxine (an SNRI).10 The STAR*D 
study3 compared venlafaxine plus mirtazapine with

tranylcypromine, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor 
antidepressant. 
Although 
the 
combination 
of 
venlafaxine and mirtazapine showed a modest 
advantage over the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, no 
placebo group was included in this comparison. The 
large CO-MED (Combining Medications to Enhance 
Depression Outcomes) randomised trial compared 
the combination of venlafaxine and mirtazapine with 
escitalopram (an SSRI) and placebo in patients who 
had either recurrent depression or chronic depression 
lasting at least two years.11 Response rates did not differ 
between the two groups, but the burden of adverse 
effects was greater in the combined antidepressant 
group. Those recruited into CO-MED differed from our 
study population in that they were not necessarily 
taking an antidepressant at baseline.
Unanswered questions
Half of those who take antidepressants in an adequate 
dose for an adequate duration remain depressed.3 28 
This represents a substantial burden of illness and 
an unmet or inadequately met need. Although many 
patients in this group can benefit from cognitive 
behavioural therapy, it is not always easily available nor 
is it universally effective.20 In primary care, where most 
initial encounters between people with depression and 
clinicians take place, antidepressants are still widely 
prescribed and remain a first line treatment. Several 
drug strategies have been developed to help those 
who do not respond to first line treatment, but the 
evidence supporting them is not of high quality.6 There 
is therefore a lack of clear guidance for clinicians in an 
area of unmet need, and this is particularly important 
in primary care because of the size of the population 
who experience no improvements from antidepressant 
treatment.28
Conclusion
The lack of clear evidence of benefit in our study, 
combined with the increased burden of adverse 
effects in the mirtazapine group, means that we 
cannot recommend this combination as a routine 
strategy in primary care for those who remain 
depressed after adequate treatment with SSRI or SNRI 
antidepressants.
