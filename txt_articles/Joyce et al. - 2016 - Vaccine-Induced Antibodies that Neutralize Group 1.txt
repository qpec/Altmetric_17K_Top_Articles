SUMMARY
Antibodies capable of neutralizing divergent influ-
enza A viruses could form the basis of a universal vac-
cine. Here, from subjects enrolled in an H5N1 DNA/
MIV-prime-boost influenza vaccine trial, we sorted
hemagglutinin cross-reactive memory B cells and
identified three antibody classes, each capable of
neutralizing diverse subtypes of group 1 and group
2 influenza A viruses. Co-crystal structures with hem-
agglutinin revealed that each class utilized character-
istic germline genes and convergent sequence motifs
to recognize overlapping epitopes in the hemaggluti-
nin stem. All six analyzed subjects had sequences
from at least one multidonor class, and—in half the
subjects—multidonor-class sequences were recov-
eredfrom >40%of cross-reactive B cells.Bycontrast,
these multidonor-class sequences were rare in pub-
lished antibody datasets. Vaccination with a diver-
gent hemagglutinin can thus increase the frequency
of B cells encoding broad influenza A-neutralizing an-
tibodies. We propose the sequence signature-quanti-
fied prevalence of these B cells as a metric to guide
universal influenza A immunization strategies.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza A viruses can be categorized into two phylogenetic
groups (group 1 and group 2), each containing diverse subtypes
(Figure 1A). Currently, group 1 influenza viruses from the H1 sub-
type (1918 and 2009 H1N1 pandemics), and the group 2 H3 sub-
type (1968 H3N2 pandemic), co-circulate and cause seasonal in-
fections in over 10% of the human population each year. Other
subtypes have emerged or threaten to re-emerge including the
group 1 H2 subtype, endemic in humans from 1957–1968, the
group 1 H5 subtype, which includes lethal avian strains (Sub-
barao et al., 1998), and the group 1 H6 and H9 and the group 2
H7 and H10 subtypes, which have been associated with human
infections and fatalities in recent years (Butt et al., 2005; Morens
et al., 2013). Frequent zoonotic cross-overs that may cause pan-
demics of unpredictable frequency and severity highlight the
need for a universal influenza vaccine that is capable of eliciting
protection against divergent influenza A viruses.
Potential approaches to a universal influenza vaccine involve
the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies that recognize the
influenza hemagglutinin (HA) from multiple subtypes. One means
to accomplish this involves ontogeny-based strategies, which
seek to identify antibodies of reproducible classes and to induce
similar antibodies by vaccination (Jardine et al., 2015; Lingwood
et al., 2012; Pappas et al., 2014). We consider antibodies to be of
the same class when they recognize the same region, employ the
same structural mode of recognition, and develop through
similar recombination and maturation pathways (Kwong and
Mascola, 2012). Reproducible classes, which are observed in
multiple individuals, represent immunological solutions to the
challenge of broad influenza A neutralization that might be avail-
able to the general human population.
The influenza A-neutralizing stem-directed antibodies that uti-
lize the HV1-69 germline gene are one such multidonor class

 et al., 2008). In terms of reproducibility, the HV1-69-derived an-
tibodies have the additional advantage of utilizing heavy chain-
only recognition, and prior studies have shown their vaccine-
induced elicitation (Khurana et al., 2013; Ledgerwood et al.,
2011, 2013; Sui et al., 2009; Wheatley et al., 2015; Whittle
et al., 2014). However, HV1-69-derived antibodies generally do
not neutralize both group 1 and group 2 strains of influenza A,
and, only a single HV1-69-derived antibody has been identified
(CR9114) capable of neutralizing both group 1 and group 2
strains of influenza A (Dreyfus et al., 2012). Other broadly neutral-
izing antibodies have been identified, such as FI6v3 and 39.29,
both of which derive from the HV3-30 germline gene; however,
co-crystal structures with HA reveal different modes of recogni-
tion (Corti et al., 2011; Nakamura et al., 2013), and FI6v3 and
39.29 are thus not members of the same class. Indeed, a repro-
ducible antibody class capable of neutralizing both group 1 and
group 2 influenza A viruses has not been observed in multiple
donors.
We previously showed that subjects enrolled in the phase I
clinical trial, VRC 310—who received an A/Indonesia/05/2005
monovalent inactivated virus (MIV) vaccine primed by an H5
DNA plasmid vaccine (Ledgerwood et al., 2011, 2013) (Table
S1A)—showed transient expansion of H1- and H5-cross-reac-
tive memory B cells specific to the HA stem (Wheatley et al.,
2015; Whittle et al., 2014). To determine whether these memory
B cells might encode multidonor class antibodies capable of
neutralizing group 1 and group 2 influenza A virus, we sorted
memory B cells that reacted with both H5 (group 1) and H3
(group 2) HAs. Immunoglobulin transcripts from post-vaccina-
tion cross-reactive memory B cells were sequenced, and the
encoded antibodies were synthesized and characterized. Spe-
cifically, we assessed breadth and potency of influenza A virus
neutralization, determined representative crystal structures in
complex with HA, analyzed sequence convergence based on
V(D)J-gene recombination and somatic hypermutation (SHM),
and tested sequence signatures for their ability to identify group 1
and group 2 neutralizing antibodies. Our findings reveal repro-
ducible immunological pathways to achieve broadly reactive
antibodies and support a B cell ontogeny-based approach to ob-
taining a universal influenza A vaccine.
RESULTS
Identification of Memory B Cells Cross-Reactive with
Group 1 and Group 2 Influenza A HAs
We studied ten subjects from the VRC 310 H5N1 vaccine trial
who displayed a range of vaccine-elicited serum H5N1 neutraliza-
tion activity, as well as varied but detectable responses against
group 2 strains A/Hong Kong/1-4-MA21-1/1968 (H3N2) or
A/Netherlands/219/2003 (H7N7) (Figures 1B and S1; Tables S1B
and S2). We used recombinant group 1-specific (H5) and group
2-specific (H3) HA probes—modified to preventsialic acid binding
(HADSA) (Wheatley et al., 2015; Whittle et al., 2014)—to co-stain
and sort peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated
2 weeks post H5N1 MIV boost (Figures 1C and S2). We recovered
sequences of memory B cell immunoglobulin gene transcripts
from six of the ten studied subjects (Figure 1D).
The sequence repertoire of each subject was generally domi-
nated by clonally related transcripts comprising a small number
of clonal expansions. Transcripts derived from diverse HV genes
including HV1-18, HV3-23, HV3-64D, HV4-30, HV4-34, and
HV6-1 (Figures 1D and 1E). Notably, transcripts from HV1-69,
which often predominate group 1-specific stem-reactive anti-
bodies (Lingwood et al., 2012; Pappas et al., 2014; Wheatley
et al., 2015), comprised only 2.5% of this set of group 1 (H5+)-
group 2 (H3+) double-positive memory B cells.
Group 1 and Group 2 Neutralizing Antibodies from
Different Vaccinees Are Genetically Similar
Immunoglobulin sequences recovered from H5+ and H3+ cross-
reactive memory B cells (Table S3) showed surprising similarity.
Notably, many immunoglobulin sequences from different donors
derived from the same genetic elements (Figure 1E). To analyze
commonalities of immunoglobulin transcripts between subjects,
we considered the following seven genetic elements: inferred
heavy variable (HV), heavy diversity (HD), heavy joining (HJ)
genes, third-heavy chain complementarity-determining region
(CDR H3) length for heavy chain-gene transcript, inferred light
variable (LV) and light joining (LJ) genes, and CDR L3 length for
corresponding light chain transcripts (Figure 1E). Frequentist
analysis indicated the presence of four or more of the same ge-
netic elements in separate lineages to be statistically significant
(p % 0.001) (Figure 1E), and representative antibodies were
cloned and expressed from such lineages. Of note, our antibody
nomenclature specifies donor, lineage, and clone; e.g., antibody
56.a.09 (Figure 1E, third row) is named for subject (56), lineage
within this subject (a), and clone within this lineage (09). Most
of the expressed antibodies bound HA, and all antibodies that
bound HA competed with the antigen-binding fragment (Fab)
of the stem-directed antibodies CR9114 (Dreyfus et al., 2012)
or F10 (Sui et al., 2009) (Figure 1E), and negative stain-electron
microscopy (EM) indicated binding to the HA stem (Figure S3).
Most of these antibodies neutralized viruses from both group 1
and group 2, including subtypes H1, H3, H5, and H7, with select
antibodies also demonstrating neutralization of viruses from
subtypes H2, H9, and H10 (Figures 1E and S4; Table S4).
Notably, in both pseudovirus and microneutralization assays
of influenza A viruses, the breadth and potency for several of
the newly identified antibodies were comparable to those of
antibody CR9114 (Dreyfus et al., 2012).
To understand the immunological basis of these multidonor
humoral responses against influenza A, we analyzed the recom-
bination, SHM, and structural constraints, which drove the gen-
eration and development of these antibodies.

 A Multidonor Class of Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies
with HV6-1+HD3-3 Germline Genes
Three memory B cell lineages, from subjects 31, 54, and 56,
shared heavy chain sequences derived from recombination of
HV6-1, HD3-3, and HJ4 or HJ5 to yield highly similar amino
acid sequences in the CDR H3 (Figure 1E, top row; Table S3).
In each case, the heavy chain was paired with a light chain
sequence from KV3-20, KJ2, or KJ3 resulting in a CDR L3 of
nine amino acids. Similar affinity maturation patterns were
observed: a Val100bIleHC alteration of an HD-gene-encoded
section of the CDR H3 was completely conserved in all three lin-
eages (Figure 2A) (for clarity, each residue number is followed by
a subscript denoting parent molecule: HC, heavy chain; LC, light
chain; HA1, HA2, or HA, either HA subunit or HA in general Kabat
numbering is used for antibodies, thus, residue 100b refers to the
second insertion ‘‘b’’ after residue 100 [Kabat et al., 1991]).
Notably, these antibodies displayed neutralization breadth and
potency that rivaled that of CR9114 and exceeded that of the
group-specific CR6261 or CR8020 or of the head-directed anti-
body CH65 (Ekiert et al., 2009, 2011; Whittle et al., 2011) (Figures
2B and S4; Table S4).
To provide insight into the structural basis for the similarity
between these HV6-1+HD3-3 antibodies, we determined the
crystal structure of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) for anti-
body, 56.a.09, alone, and in complex with A/Hong Kong/1-4-
MA21-1/1968 (H3N2) HA at 3.3 A
˚ resolution (Figures 2C and
S5; Tables S5 and S6). Unexpectedly, the crystallized HA was
not trimeric, with the asymmetric unit for the crystallized Fab-
H3 complex comprising an HA head of one protomer interacting
with the HA stem of an adjacent protomer in a ‘‘head-to-stem’’
dimeric arrangement (Figures S5B and S5C). Despite this non-
trimeric
arrangement,
the
Ca-root-mean-square
deviation
(RMSD) between the 56.a.09-bound HA and the ligand-free HA
was <1 A
˚ , and, for clarity, we thus depict the 56.a.09 bound com-
plex as a typical HA trimer (Figure 2C).
Antibody 56.a.09 recognized a conserved region on the HA
stem in a manner that avoided glycans at residues Asn21HA1
(conserved on group 1 viruses) and Asn38HA1 (conserved on
group 2 viruses), providing a structural explanation for its
extraordinary group 1 and group 2 neutralization breadth. Anti-
body 56.a.09 bound primarily with its heavy chain (934 A
˚ 2 buried
surface area [BSA] versus 386 A
˚ 2 BSA for the light chain). Heavy
chain binding involved the HD3-3-encoded CDR H3 (Figure 2C)
with Phe100HC and Gly100aHC contributing �240 A
˚ 2 of BSA
and the SHM-altered Val100bIleHC inserting directly into the
Trp21HA2 pocket (contributing over 100 A
˚ 2 of interactive surface).
In addition, Met98HC interacted with a conserved aromatic resi-
due present on all light chains, helping to orient the CDR H3
(Figure 2D). Heavy chain binding also involved the HV6-1 germ-
line-encoded CDR H2, which uniquely encodes a nine-amino
acid CDR H2, contributed 182 A
˚ 2 of BSA, was unmutated in con-
tact residues in all three subjects (Figure S6), and interacted with
the conserved fusion peptide (Figure 2E). With respect to light
chain, the largely unmutated KV3-20-derived V genes (4%–6%
SHM) observed in lineages from these three subjects interacted
with the HA stem through both CDR L1 and CDR L3 (Figure 2F;
Table S6), with Tyr33LC contributing the largest BSA among all
light chain residues (73.1 A
˚ 2).
HV6-1+HD3-3-derived antibodies were thus found in three in-
dependent donors, shared genetic elements in both the heavy
and light chain, displayed convergent affinity maturation, and
appeared to share the same mode of recognition (structure-
function analysis of recognition interface and SHM are provided
in Figure S7). Furthermore, we tested for functional complemen-
tation: swapping of heavy and light chains of the three HV6-
1+HD3-3-derived antibodies resulted in six functional antibodies
from nine possible pairings (all three pairings with the heavy
chain of antibody 31.g.01 failed to express) (Table S7). Overall,
these results indicated the HV6-1+HD3-3-derived antibodies
form a multidonor class. Structural analysis indicated numerous
light chains to be compatible with binding, and �99% of the hu-
man population (Abecasis et al., 2012) possess alleles of the
HV6-1 and HD3-3 genes compatible with the class elicitation
and recognition described here (Figures 2D–2G).
A Second Multidonor Class of Broadly Neutralizing
Antibodies with HV1-18+HD3-9 Germline Genes
Two memory B cell lineages from subjects 1 and 31 shared
immunoglobulin heavy chain sequence derived from recombina-
tion of HV1-18 with HD3-9 and HJ4 to yield highly similar amino
acid sequences in a CDR H3 of 15 amino acids (Figures 1E and
S6). Notably an Arg96HC residue was encoded by N-nucleotide
addition in both cases (Figure 3A). In each donor, the heavy chain
was paired with a light chain derived from KV2-30. Encoded im-
munoglobulins were expressed and shown to neutralize primar-
ily group 1 strains of influenza A, although a few group 2 strains
were neutralized (Figure S4; Table S4). Overall neutralization
from these HV1-18+HD3-9 antibodies appeared more similar
to the group 1-specific antibody CR6261 than to the very broad
CR9114 or HV6-1-derived antibodies; nevertheless, neutraliza-
tion breadth encompassed �50% of influenza A subtypes that
commonly infect humans (Figure 3B).
We determined the crystal structure of Fab 31.b.09 in complex
with A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1) HA (Figure 3C; Tables S5 and
S6). Similar to the 56.a.09-H3 complex structure, the crystallized
hemagglutinin in the Fab 31.b.09 complex was not a trimer, but a
molecular dimer (Figure S5). Despite this unexpected non-
trimeric arrangement, the Ca-RMSD between the 31.b.09-
bound HA and the ligand-free HA in the stem region was 0.6 A
˚ ,
and for clarity, we depict the 31.b.09 bound complex in a more
typical trimeric arrangement (Figure 3C). The HV1-18+HD3-9-
derived antibody 31.b.09 bound an epitope that overlapped
the HV6-1+HD3-3 class epitope, but with antibody rotated
�105� (mostly involving a rotation perpendicular to the trimer
axis) (Figure 3C). Antibody 31.b.09 bound with both heavy and
light chains (343 A
˚ 2 BSA for heavy chain and 540 A
˚ 2 BSA for
the light chain). Heavy chain interactions were generated
through CDR H2 and H3 loops. In the CDR H2 (127 A
˚ 2 BSA),
the HV1-18 germline-encoded Tyr53HC recognized the fusion
peptide of HA2 and Asn56HC recognized helix A of HA2, while
the CDR H3 (216 A
˚ 2 BSA) was positioned over the fusion pep-
tide-helix A interface with Ile99HC and Leu100HC inserting into
the hydrophobic groove between these two conserved elements
(Figures 3C–3E). Light chain interactions involved CDR L1 and
L3, which recognized helix A (Figure 3F). We tested functional
complementation: swapping of heavy and light chains between

 two antibodies of the putative class resulted in functional anti-
bodies for all four of the possible pairings (Table S7). Overall,
the results indicated the HV1-18+HD3-9-derived antibodies

 SHM. The multiple alternative D gene alleles that could be used
to generate CDR H3s compatible with recognition by this multi-
donor class, in combination with a large number of compatible
light chains, led to a calculated distribution of potential HV1-18
combinations in the human population of close to 100% (Abeca-
sis et al., 2012) (Figure 3G).
A Third Multidonor Class of Broadly Neutralizing
Antibodies with HV1-18 Germline Gene and Q-x-x-V
Motif
Multiple B cell lineages in two subjects (16 and 54) produced
distinctive HV1-18-derived immunoglobulins sharing five genetic
elements and having a CDR H3 of 21 amino acids derived from
recombination with either HD2-2 or HD2-15 genes (Figure 4A;
Table S3). This set of immunoglobulins all shared an SHM-
derived Thr54HC, a Gln98HC encoded by P-nucleotide addition,
and a germline HD-encoded aliphatic residue at position100aHC
(Q-x-x-V motif). Neutralization breadth and potency for this set of
immunoglobulins were similar to that of antibody CR9114 (Fig-
ure S4; Table S4), neutralizing all common human-infecting sub-
types of influenza A except H2 and exceeding substantially the
breadth of group 1-specific or group 2-specific stem antibodies
or the head-directed antibody CH65 (Figure 4B). To understand
the basis of their recognition, we crystallized representative
antibodies with HA. Co-crystal structures of representative
HV1-18+HD2-2 (16.a.26) and HV1-18+HD2-15 (16.g.07) Fabs
in complex with the A/Hong Kong/1-4-MA21-1/1968 (H3N2)
HA revealed highly similar epitopes (Figures 4C–4H; Tables S5
and S6). Antibody binding occurred primarily through heavy
chain recognition of the conserved HA stem. With 16.a.26, the
heavy chain contributed 514 A
˚ 2 of BSA while the light chain
contributed 283 A
˚ 2 of BSA, and with 16.g.07, the heavy chain
contributed 646 A
˚ 2 of BSA while the light chain contributed
329 A
˚ 2 of BSA.
Heavy chain interactions were generated primarily through
CDR H2 (�150 A
˚ 2 BSA for 16.a.26 and �200 A
˚ 2 BSA for
16.g.07) and CDR H3 (�300 A
˚ 2 BSA for 16.a.26 and �450 A
˚ 2
BSA for 16.g.07) with the HV1-18 germline-encoded Tyr53HC
and the SHM-derived Thr54HC recognizing the N-terminal region
of HA1 and the hydrophobic groove between helix A and the
fusion peptide of HA2 (Figures 4D and 4G; Table S6). The CDR
H3s of these antibodies also bound the conserved hydrophobic
groove next to helix A and adjacent to Trp21HA2. The conserved
Val100aHC inserted into a pocket present on both group 1 and
group 2 HAs, just above Trp21HA2 and proximal to Ile48HA2.
Despite differences between residues encoded by HD2-2
(16.a.26) and HD2-15 (16.g.07), the CDR H3s from both anti-
bodies were oriented perpendicular to the Fab axis and inter-
acted similarly with HA. The conserved Gln98HC interacted
with Gln42HA2 by occupying a germline-encoded pocket unique
to HV1-18-encoded antibodies, which was formed by framework
residues Gly33HC and Ser52HC (Figures 4E and 4H). The location
of Gln98HC within the framework pocket likely stabilized the
perpendicular orientation of the CDR H3 relative to the anti-
body-framework regions and may allow for CDR H3-motifs
derived from diverse D genes to bind to this conserved hydro-
phobic groove. In this regard, we note that sequences from sub-
ject 01 with an HV1-18 germline gene and a Gln98-x-x-Val100a
motif in a 17-amino acid CDR H3 were able to neutralize H3
and H5 strains of influenza. Although light chains of this class
contribute approximately one-third of the total buried surface
area, analysis of antibodies of this class revealed light chain se-
quences to derive from diverse LV genes, with only KV3-11 ap-
pearing twice. The recently reported HV1-18-derived group 1
and group 2 neutralizing antibody CT149 uses a Gln98HC-x-x-
Val100aHC motif with a 19-amino acid CDR H3 to bind the HA
stem (Wu et al., 2015) and recognized HA in a manner highly
similar to both 16.a.26 and 16.g.07. We tested the functional
complementation for antibodies 16.a.26, 16.g.07, 54.a.39,
54.a.84, and CT149 from donors 16, 54, and SH-K1 (the source
of antibody CT149). Swapping of heavy and light chains between
these five antibodies resulted in ten functional antibodies from
the 25 possible pairings (Table S7). Functionality correlated
strongly with HV gene identity and CDR H3 length (Table S7),
suggesting a requirement for specific heavy-light chain pairings.
Despite this requirement, the HV1-18 antibodies with Thr54HC
and CDR H3 98Q-x-x-V motif appeared to form a multidonor
class. Thus, the recombination of HV1-18 with many alternative
D gene segments yields a Q-x-x-V motif in the CDR H3, which
may comprise a common solution for neutralization of group 1
and group 2 influenza A viruses. The many alternative HD gene
alleles that can be used to generate CDR H3s for this multidonor
class in combination with no obvious light chain bias led to a
calculated distribution of potential HV1-18 combinations in the
human population of close to 100% (Abecasis et al., 2012) (Fig-
ures 4I and 4J).
Multidonor and Lineage-Unique Antibodies that
Neutralize Group 1 and Group 2 Viruses Recognize
Similar Epitopes
For the six subjects analyzed, the most highly expanded lineage
was lineage ‘‘a’’ from subject 31, from which we sequenced 104
clones (Figure 1E; Table S2). Clone 83 of this lineage (antibody
31.a.83) derived from HV3-23, HD3-9, and HJ6 and displayed
the

of
the
antibodies
we
sequenced and expressed, neutralizing all of the common influ-
enza A subtypes that infect humans (Figure 5A). Structural char-
acterization of antibody 31.a.83 in complex with A/Hong Kong/1-
4-MA21-1/1968 (H3N2) HA (Table S5) revealed binding to the
conserved HA stem, primarily through CDR H3 residues, many
of which were somatically hypermutated (Figures 5B–5D; Table
S6). Antibody 31.a.83 utilized hydrophobic residues to contact
an epitope adjacent to helix A and involving the Trp21HA2 pocket
with its CDR H3 parallel to helix A in a manner that avoided the
conserved N-glycan at Asn38HA1 present in group 2 HAs.
A second lineage, ‘‘h’’ from subject 56 (lineage 56.h), also
derived from the same germline genes as antibody 31.a.83 (Fig-
ures 5B and S6). However, critical CDR H3 contact residues of
antibody 31.a.83 were not conserved and a four-amino acid shift
relative to the V-gene was observed (Figure 5B). Moreover, the
representative antibody we expressed and analyzed from this
second lineage, antibody 56.h.01, neutralized H1, H2, and H9
subtypes, but not H3, H5, or H7 subtypes (Figures 1E and S4;
Table S4). Together, these observations indicated lineages
31.a and 56.h to have different modes of recognition, providing
an example of influenza A-targeting antibodies that derived

 from the same heavy chain-VDJ genes, but did not use the same
mode of recognition nor share convergent development.
Thus, antibody lineages may be multidonor (common or pub-
lic), meaning that they are observed in different individuals and
share the same genetic elements and mode of recognition (Hen-
ry Dunand and Wilson, 2015; Zhou et al., 2013), or unique (un-
common or private), meaning that they have only been observed
a single time. We observed no substantial difference between
epitopes of multidonor and unique antibodies capable of neutral-
izing group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses (Figures 5E and 5F),
nor did we observe segregation in antibody approach to HA used
by multidonor or unique antibodies (Figures S3E and S3F). Anti-
bodies from multidonor lineages did, however, have lower SHM
(averaging 8% for multidonor versus 11% for the unique). The
lower SHM suggested that multidonor antibodies may undergo
more parsimonious development. We note that unique lineages

six analyzed VRC 310 donors (1, 31, 36, and 56); in light of the
positive functional characteristics of several of the unique line-
ages (e.g., 31.a.83), it seems likely that these antibodies would
contribute to a protective response. As the number of donors
with sequenced cross-reactive memory B cells increases, we
would expect some of the antibodies described here as
‘‘unique’’ to be observed in other donors.

 quantify class transcripts and to identify potential class mem-
bers in other subjects. Notably, despite a sequence signature
requiring residue 54HC to be altered by affinity maturation, the
HV1-18 (Q-x-x-V) class accounted for over half of the H5+ and
H3+ cross-reactive B cells we sequenced (Figure 6A) and could
be found in half the analyzed vaccinees (Figure 6B).
For other subjects, we searched published human antibody
datasets,
both
those
with
paired
heavy-light
sequences
(DeKosky et al., 2015), as well as those with heavy chain-only se-
quences (Figure 6A; Table S1C). Searches with the HV6-
1+HD3-3 signature did not yield sequence matches in paired
heavy-light sequences, but in the published heavy chain-only
datasets, we found 13 matches, which appeared to derive
from a single lineage (Figure S6). We chose both consensus as
well as the sequence closest to consensus to synthesize and
reconstitute with light chains of HV6-1+HD3-3 class antibodies
from subjects 54 and 56. One of these reconstituted antibodies
did not express, but the other three did and bound H1 HA in a
manner that could be competed with antibody F10 (Figure 6C).
We tested two of these antibodies and both neutralized group
1 and group 2 influenza A strains (Figure 6D; Table S3), and
the neutralization signatures (Georgiev et al., 2013) of the synthe-
sized antibodies clustered in a dendrogram with known HV6-
1+HD3-3 class antibodies (Figure 6E).
With the HV1-18+HD3-9 signature, we found 17 matches in
published paired heavy-light chain sequences, which appeared
to derive from a single lineage (Figure 6A). We synthesized
consensus sequences and reconstituted published heavy and
light chains as well as the published heavy chain and light chain
of this class from subject 31. Both of these reconstituted anti-
bodies bound H1 hemagglutinin in a manner that could be
competed with antibody F10 (Figure 6C), neutralized group 1
influenza A strains (Figure 6D; Table S4), and clustered in a
neutralization dendrogram with known HV1-18+HD3-9 class
antibodies (Figure 6E). The neutralization breadth of these anti-
bodies was lower than those isolated from VRC 310 subjects,
likely due to the use of germline sequences to complete the
CDR L1 and CDR L2 regions of this antibody (the somatic mu-
tation of 27ELC to Ile is required for optimal recognition)
(Figure 3F).
With the HV1-18 (Q-x-x-V) signature, searches did not yield
sequence matches in paired heavy-light sequences, but in
published heavy chain-only datasets (Table S1C), we found
244 matches, which appeared to derive from 4 lineages (Fig-
ures 6A and S6). We synthesized four sequences (consensus
or closest NGS read) and reconstituted with the five light
chains used previously in swapping experiments (Table S7).
None of these reconstituted antibodies bound a set of HAs
(Figure 6C) or neutralized any of the 15 viruses in our neutrali-
zation panel. Analysis of the tested heavy chains indicated that
their CDR H3 length matched that of CT149 in three of four
cases, but was below the 78% identity threshold that corre-
lated with function in heavy-light complementation of this class
(Table S7).
Altogether, the results indicate sequence signatures with suf-
ficient specificity to identify other functional class members by
sequence alone could be obtained for two multidonor classes:
HV6-1+HD3-3 and HV1-18+HD3-9. The sequence signature
for the third class, HV1-18 (Q-x-x-V), was complicated by incom-
patibility of some heavy-light pairs from this class; nonetheless,
sequence searches for this third class did place an upper limit on
the prevalence of this multidonor antibody class in the searched
databases.
Vaccine Induction of Multidonor Broadly Neutralizing
Antibodies
In the VRC 310 trial, we observed a significant expansion
(p = 0.0284) of H5+H3+ memory B cells following H5 DNA
prime-MIV boost, ranging from an increase of 1.2- to 10.6-fold
(Figure 7A). Notably, subjects with the largest increases and
the highest frequencies of multidonor antibodies had the largest
percentages of antibodies belonging to the three multidonor
classes identified here (Figure 7B). Our initial observation of a
high number of transcripts with multiple genetic commonalities
may be explained by the preferential expansion of multidonor
class transcripts; indeed, the fold-increase in cross-reactive B
cells by subject correlated with the percentage of antibody se-
quences with inter-subject genetic commonalities (Figure 7C).
Importantly, the frequency of cross-reactive memory B cells
post-VRC 310 vaccination correlated with the sequence signa-
ture-identified
prevalence
of
multidonor
class
antibodies
(p = 0.0045) (Figure S6D). Moreover, while we did not see signif-
icant correlation between fold increase in overall sera titer versus
an increase in cross-reactive memory B cells, we did observe a
significant correlation in titers with the H1N1 virus, A/Singapore/
8/1986, which we previously found to be especially sensitive to
neutralization by stem-directed antibodies (Lingwood et al.,
2012) (Figure 7D).
To quantify the frequency of multidonor class antibodies in
unvaccinated subjects, we examined NGS-determined memory
B cell transcripts from healthy normal donors (Figure 6A). To
compare frequencies from VRC 310-vaccinated versus unvacci-
nated subjects, we equated the total number of sorted memory
B cells with the total number of transcripts and observed a sub-
stantially higher transcript frequency (and to a lesser degree,
a higher lineage frequency) for multidonor class sequences on
H5N1 vaccination in the VRC 310 trial (Figure 7E).
We also examined published antibody sequences from sub-
jects immunized with the 2009 or 2010 seasonal influenza
vaccine (Jiang et al., 2013) (Figures 6A, 7F, and S6). Overall, tran-
scripts matching the HV1-18+HD3-9 signature were �103 more
prevalent prior to vaccination than the other multidonor tran-
scripts; however, this class appeared not to expand on either
seasonal or VRC 310 vaccination. By contrast, transcripts
matching HV6-1+HD3-3 and HV1-18 (Q-x-x-V) signatures ap-
peared to be present at low frequency prior to vaccination, to in-
crease on seasonal vaccination, and to increase up to 1,000-fold
on VRC 310 vaccination (Figure 7F).
DISCUSSION
The vaccine induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies against
influenza A virus has been a long standing immunological goal.
While the human immune system can generate antibodies
capable of neutralizing group 1 and group 2 strains of influenza
(Corti et al., 2011; Dreyfus et al., 2012; Nakamura et al., 2013;

 Wu et al., 2015), clear evidence of their induction by vaccination
had not been reported. In this study, we used a sequence-based
structural approach to identify three multidonor classes of anti-
bodies capable of neutralizing group 1 and group 2 influenza A
viruses in VRC 310-vaccinated subjects. One multidonor class
utilized HV6-1+HD3-3 germline genes (Figure 2); a second class
utilized HV1-18+HD3-9 germline genes and a 15-amino acid
CDR H3 (Figure 3); and a third class utilized HV1-18 germline
gene and a Gln98HC-x-x-Val100aHC motif (Figure 4). For each
class, we delineated sequence signatures (Figure 6). Despite
the lack of serological indicators of vaccine-induced improve-
ment in cross neutralization with VRC 310-vaccinated subjects
(Figure S1), we observed a significant vaccine-induced expan-
sion of cross-reactive memory B cells (Figure 7A) and a clear in-
crease in the frequency of transcripts for two of the multidonor
antibody classes (Figure 7F). These findings reveal the vaccine
induction of broadly neutralizing influenza A antibodies.
Stereotypic antibody signatures have been reported for some
bacterial polysaccharide antigens (Adderson et al., 1993), CD4-
induced, V1V2-directed, and VRC01 classes of HIV-1-neutral-
izing antibodies (Dosenovic et al., 2015; Gorman et al., 2016;
Huang et al., 2004; Jardine et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2013), and
both stem- and head-directed influenza neutralizing antibodies
(Pappas et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2015). Thus, despite the po-
tential repertoire of human immunoglobulins being large (Boyd
et al., 2009) and SHM further increasing diversity to the point
where highly similar modes of antigen recognition might be ex-
pected very infrequently, our findings reveal that multidonor clas-
ses can be induced by vaccination in humans (Figures 7 and S7).
The coexistence of multiple vaccine-induced pathways to
generate influenza group 1 and group 2 neutralizing antibodies
is encouraging for efforts aimed at achieving analogous re-
sponses in genetically diverse human populations. The stem-
directed antibodies induced here potently neutralize in pseudo-
type assays (Figure S4), but less potently in live influenza A virus
assays (Table S4). While determination of the in vivo concentra-
tions of stem antibodies required for protective efficacy may
require passive infusion trials in humans, it seems likely that a
protective response will require higher titers of group 1 and
group 2 neutralizing antibodies than achieved in the VRC 310
trial. Our NGS-based measurements indicated VRC 310 vacci-
nation to boost the frequency of transcripts from two multidonor
classes substantially toward the target goal, and we even
observed increases after seasonal vaccination (Figure 7F). In
this regard, sequence signature-based quantification may pro-
vide a suitably sensitive technology to detect transcript fre-
quencies of group 1 and group 2 neutralizing antibodies, to
measure their expression in appropriate memory B cell subsets
and long-lived plasma cells, and to assess their durability.
Appropriate SHM is an additional aspect, which we investigated
by analyzing the recognition of germline-reverted versions of
each of the three multidonor classes as well as the effect of
mutational analysis of critical contacts (Figure S7). Further
studies aimed at increasing the prevalence of group 1 and group
2 neutralizing influenza antibody lineages—guided by the
sequence signatures identified here—may provide a means to
achieve the protective efficacy required of a universal influenza
A vaccine. In this regard, it is helpful to know that 100- to
1,000-fold increases in the transcript frequencies for two multi-
donor classes of influenza A neutralizing antibodies could be
achieved through immunization with a divergent influenza (Fig-
ures 6A and 7F), likely by enhancing immune focus to the HA
stem (Figures 7G and 7H), an approach utilized by ‘‘stem-only’’
or ‘‘headless’’ immunogens (Impagliazzo et al., 2015; Yassine
et al., 2015) and by chimeric HA immunogens (Krammer et al.,
2015). It will be fascinating to evaluate how these immunogens,
in various vectored, subunit, and prime-boost combinations, will
fare at further inducing, maintaining, or expanding the multidonor
broadly neutralizing antibodies identified here.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement and VRC 310 Study Design
The VRC 310 study protocol and associated procedures were approved by the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Institutional Re-
view Board. All participants provided written informed consent in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. The VRC 310 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01086657) (Ledgerwood et al., 2011, 2013) was conducted by the Vaccine
Research Center, NIH. See Table S1 and the Supplemental Experimental Pro-
cedures for details.
Expression of HA Probes, Flow Cytometry, Cell Sorting, and
Sequencing
HA constructs consisting of the extracellular domain of HA modified to ablate
sialic acid binding and C-terminally fused to (1) a T4-fibritin trimerization motif,
(2) a biotinylatable AviTag sequence, and (3) a hexahistidine affinity tag were
synthesized (Genscript), cloned into a CMV-expression plasmid, and ex-
pressed as previously described (Whittle et al., 2014). Cryopreserved PBMC
samples were stained and sorted on a fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) Aria II using fluorescently labeled recombinant H1 (A/New Caledonia/
20/1999), H5 (A/Indonesia/05/2005), or H3 (A/Perth/16/2009) probes; single
memory B cells binding to both H5 and H3 probes were sorted, and
sequencing of immunoglobulin genes by multiplex PCR was performed as pre-
viously described (Whittle et al., 2014). See the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures for details.
Production of Pseudotyped Lentiviral Vectors and Influenza A
Viruses and Measurement of Antibody Neutralizing Activity
Influenza HA pseudotyped lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter
gene were produced and used to infect 293A cells. All influenza viruses
used in the microneutralization assays were expanded in Madin-Darby canine
kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells in the presence of Tosyl phenylalanyl chloro-
methyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma) and titrated in MDCK cells.
See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details.
Structural Analysis and Sequence Bioinformatics
Both negative stain-EM and X-ray crystallography were used to characterize
antibodies from the VRC 310 trial and their complexes with HA. An Antibo-
dyomics1.0 pipeline, modified to analyze both 454 and Illumina output,
was used to analyze B cell transcripts for the presence of sequence signa-
tures specific to multidonor antibodies. Frequentist probabilities were used
to determine likelihoods of sequence convergence and germline prevalence
in the human population. See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
details.
