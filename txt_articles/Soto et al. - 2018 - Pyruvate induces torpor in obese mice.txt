Mice subjected to cold or caloric deprivation can reduce body
temperature and metabolic rate and enter a state of torpor. Here
we show that administration of pyruvate, an energy-rich meta-
bolic intermediate, can induce torpor in mice with diet-induced or
genetic obesity. This is associated with marked hypothermia,
decreased activity, and decreased metabolic rate. The drop in
body temperature correlates with the degree of obesity and is
blunted by housing mice at thermoneutrality. Induction of torpor
by pyruvate in obese mice relies on adenosine signaling and is
accompanied by changes in brain levels of hexose bisphosphate
and GABA as detected by mass spectroscopy-based imaging.
Pyruvate does not induce torpor in lean mice but results in the
activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT) with an increase in the
level of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). Denervation of BAT in lean
mice blocks this increase in UCP1 and allows the pyruvate-induced
torpor phenotype. Thus, pyruvate administration induces torpor in
obese mice by pathways involving adenosine and GABA signaling
and a failure of normal activation of BAT.

hermoregulation and metabolism are well-regulated mecha-
nisms in mammals and are essential for survival and re-
production. When mammals are subjected to cold temperature
and/or diminished calories, energy-saving thermoregulation
strategies become critical. Many mammals can save energy by
inducing a state of hypometabolism (1), which, depending on its
duration, is called either “hibernation” or “torpor.” Hibernation
consists of consecutive multiday bouts of torpor with a low
metabolic rate and low body temperature (Tb) (although the
variation among species is large), can last months, and is often
interrupted by episodes of arousal (2). Torpor is a state in which
core Tb drops to less than 32 °C and there is markedly reduced
activity (3). Torpor usually lasts less than 12–14 h. Mice undergo
torpor when confronted with food deprivation or a combination
of food deprivation and cold (4, 5). Torpor can also be induced
by administration of 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which blocks cellular
uptake of glucose (6), or hydrogen sulfide, which inhibits oxi-
dative phosphorylation (7).
The biochemical events underlying torpor are poorly un-
derstood. In mammals, the fall in leptin (an anorexigenic hor-
mone) during fasting has been suggested to play a role, and
administration of leptin prevents deep bouts of fasting-induced
torpor (8, 9). In addition, leptin-deficient ob/ob mice undergo
longer episodes of torpor when calorie-deprived than lean mice
(9). On the other hand, administration of ghrelin, an orexigenic
peptide, deepens torpor bouts by acting on neuropeptide Y
neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (10). This
brain region is a key player in the homeostatic regulation of food
intake and metabolism and also is important in fasting-induced
torpor, as fasted mice with lesions in the arcuate nucleus do not
enter torpor (10).
Mammals generate heat by two major mechanisms: shivering
thermogenesis involving skeletal muscle and nonshivering ther-
mogenesis via activation of brown and beige adipose tissue
(BAT). Nonshivering thermogenesis is primarily under the con-
trol of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which can activate
BAT-specific mitochondrial uncoupling protein-1 (UCP1). UCP1
activity is modulated during hibernation and torpor. For example,
in the ground squirrel the thermogenic capacity of BAT increases
before hibernation as a result of increased BAT mass, increased
abundance of mitochondria in BAT, and increased expression of
genes involved in thermogenesis in BAT, including UCP1 (11).
Conversely, during entrance into fasting-induced torpor, sympa-
thetic activation of BAT in mice is shut down, and the thermo-
neutral zone is shifted to a lower ambient temperature to
compensate for the energy deficit (12). However, the exact links
between BAT and metabolic factors triggering torpor are still
poorly understood.
In the present study, we show that systemic administration of
pyruvate induces a full-blown state of torpor with hypothermia
and markedly decreased activity and respiratory rate in both diet-
induced obese (DIO) mice and in mice with genetic obesity
(db/db and ob/ob) but not in lean mice. UCP1 activation in
BAT is key in preventing pyruvate induced-torpor in lean mice,
and denervation of BAT allows pyruvate to induce the torpor
phenotype in these mice. In obese mice, torpor relies on
adenosine signaling, and MALDI-MS imaging shows a critical
role for brain metabolites, including GABA, in the induction of
torpor. Our data show that the energy-rich substrate pyruvate is
a metabolic trigger of torpor in obese mice, and prevention of
this hypometabolic state in lean mice relies on BAT activation,
adenosine signaling, and GABAergic brain circuits.
Results
Pyruvate Induces Torpor in DIO Mice. Pyruvate is an energy-rich
intermediate in cellular metabolism and a precursor for glucose
production in the liver. Pyruvate supplements enhance
weight loss during dietary treatment of obesity and improve
Significance
Mice can reduce their body temperature and metabolic rate
and enter torpor when they are subjected to cold, calorie
deprivation, or administration of some metabolic inhibitors.
Here we show that administration of pyruvate, a key metabolic
intermediate and substrate for gluconeogenesis, induces tor-
por in obese mice, resulting in marked hypothermia, decreased
activity, and decreased metabolic rate. This is dependent on
adenosine signaling and on changes in key brain metabolites,
including GABA. Lean mice are protected from pyruvate-
induced torpor by activating their brown adipose tissue. Un-
derstanding this pathway can help provide new approaches for
inducing a hypometabolic state in mammals, which could be
beneficial in states of food deprivation or ischemia–reperfusion
injury and for organ preservation in surgical situations.

 hypercholesterolemia (13). To investigate the effect of py-
ruvate in obesity, C57BL/6J mice were placed on a high-fat diet
(HFD) for 13 wk and then were injected with pyruvate (2 g/kg) in
the fasted state. At that time, the prefasting mean body weight
was ∼46 g for the HFD-obese mice and ∼31 g for age-matched,
chow-fed lean controls. In the lean controls, overnight fasting
induced an acute drop in Tb of ∼3–4 °C, as measured by an s.c.-
implanted intrascapular sensor (Fig. S1A). In the DIO mice, Tb
also tended to drift down during the overnight fast, but the fall
did not reach statistical significance (Fig. S1A). However, pyru-
vate injection induced a rapid and dramatic loss of Tb in fasted
DIO mice, which reached an average of 31.7 °C at 1 h after in-
jection; this was not seen in lean controls (diet effect: P = 0.01)
(Fig. 1A). These differences were confirmed by a measurement
of Tb using a rectal probe, which showed a ΔTb of approxi-
mately −6 °C in HFD-fed mice versus no change in lean mice
(Fig. 1B and Fig. S1B), and by surface thermal imaging (Fig. 1C).
The extent of the drop in Tb in pyruvate-injected mice negatively
correlated with body weight (P < 0.001, R2 = 0.78) (Fig. 1D) and
was accompanied by a 50% decrease in heat production in DIO
mice (Fig. S1C). Pyruvate-injected DIO mice also showed an
81% decrease in spontaneous activity compared with lean mice
(P = 0.003) (Fig. 1E). The combination of the fall in Tb below
33 °C for two or more consecutive hours and the decrease in
activity defines the state as torpor (14).
To determine whether pyruvate decreases Tb through effects
on metabolism, we analyzed O2 consumption (VO2), CO2 pro-
duction (VCO2), and the respiratory exchange ratio (RER),
using metabolic cages. In fasted lean mice, VO2 and VCO2 in-
creased transiently after saline injection, but there was no sig-
nificant effect of injection over time (Fig. 1F and Fig. S1D). In
fasted DIO mice, VO2 decreased by over 40% (from 2,600 to
∼1,500 mL·kg−1·h−1) within 10 min after pyruvate injection
(Fig. 1F), and this was maintained for the duration of the study
(7 h). Likewise, VCO2 dropped from 1,700 mL·kg−1·h−1 to
∼1,000 mL·kg−1·h−1 over a similar timeframe (Fig. S1D), reflect-
ing a fall in the metabolic rate. The RER increased after pyruvate
injection in both control and DIO mice but increased significantly
more in the latter (P = 0.0002) (Fig. 1G). This is consistent with
the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, which enters the TCA
cycle and mirrors an increase in carbohydrate versus lipid oxida-
tion. Thus, in DIO mice, pyruvate produces a profound state of
torpor with a major suppression of activity, metabolic rate, and Tb.
Pyruvate Injection Induces Changes in Circulating Pyruvate, Glucose,
and Lactate. Pyruvate is converted into glucose by gluconeogen-
esis in the liver, and gluconeogenesis is impaired in obese insulin-
resistant mice (15). We hypothesized that this difference in py-
ruvate metabolism between lean and obese mice might affect
circulating molecules of downstream signaling pathways. Fol-
lowing i.p. injection of pyruvate, plasma levels of pyruvate in-
creased in lean mice for 30 min and then declined to basal levels
by 6 h after injection (Fig. 2A). DIO mice tended to have higher
fasting pyruvate levels (P = 0.08), but the kinetics of increase and
decline followed a similar time course, although the area under
the curve (AUC) was significantly higher. As expected, pyruvate
injection increased blood glucose levels in both lean and DIO
mice (Fig. 2B), with a greater effect in the latter, consistent with
their insulin-resistant state and increased gluconeogenesis (P =
0.0002) (Fig. 2B). Insulin levels, which were markedly increased
in HFD mice, decreased after fasting and were not changed 2 h
after pyruvate administration (Fig. S1E). Since pyruvate can be
converted into lactate, plasma lactate increased acutely by 2.6-
fold in HFD-obese mice after pyruvate administration. In lean
mice, lactate increased by less than 20% (Fig. 2C), despite
starting with similar fasting levels. Plasma leptin was 20-fold
higher in DIO mice than in lean mice, reflecting the increased fat
mass and leptin resistance. However, leptin and FGF21 levels
were not changed 2 h after the injection of pyruvate in either
chow-fed or DIO mice (Fig. S1 F and G). We also ruled out the
possibility that pyruvate induced lactic acidosis, as blood pH did
not decrease but instead increased rather significantly at 2 h after
pyruvate injection in both lean and DIO mice (Fig. S1H).
Pyruvate Induces Torpor in ob/ob and db/db Mice. Mice with ho-
mozygous deletion of leptin (ob/ob) or leptin receptor (db/db)
are hyperphagic and develop marked obesity and glucose
intolerance. As in HFD-obese mice, db/db and ob/ob mice
exhibited a profound decrease in intrascapular s.c. Tb following
the injection of pyruvate compared with saline. This occurred in
both the fed (Fig. 3A) and fasted states (Fig. 3B), although the
fall in Tb was more rapid in the fed state than in the fasted state.
The hypothermia observed in both states was more prolonged
than in DIO mice. The pyruvate-induced hypothermia in db/db
mice was accompanied by decreased heat production (Fig. S2A)
and decreased skin temperature (Fig. S2B). As in DIO mice,
pyruvate-induced torpor in ob/ob and db/db mice was associ-
ated with an ∼70% drop in activity levels in both the fasted (Fig.
3C) and the fed (Fig. S2C) state and by greater increases in
blood glucose levels than in lean C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 3D). Fur-
thermore, in db/db mice, but not in lean mice, both VO2 and
VCO2 were significantly lower after pyruvate administration
than after saline administration (Fig. 3E and Fig. S2D), reflecting
a lower metabolic rate. As in DIO mice, the RER increased
markedly after pyruvate injection in db/db mice (Fig. S2E). Thus,
pyruvate-induced hypothermia in db/db mice was more severe
and was accompanied by reduced heat production and a lower
metabolic rate.

PHYSIOLOGY
 Role of BAT in Pyruvate-Induced Torpor. To determine the role of
BAT thermogenesis in pyruvate-induced torpor, we measured
the levels of UCP1 in the BAT of lean and DIO mice after py-
ruvate administration. UCP1 protein levels increased by twofold
in the BAT of chow-fed mice by 2 h after pyruvate injection
compared with saline-injected mice (P < 0.05, four independent
experiments) (Fig. 4 A and B). This increase in UCP1 protein
occurred despite a small but significant decrease in UCP1
mRNA (Fig. S3A), suggesting that the increase in UCP1 was due
to an increase in translation or a decrease in UCP1 degradation.
Consistent with previous studies (16), DIO mice had approxi-
mately threefold higher levels of UCP1 than lean mice, but in
these mice pyruvate did not increase UCP1 at either the protein
(Fig. 4 A and B) or mRNA (Fig. S3A) level. On the other hand,
db/db mice had lower levels of UCP1 in BAT than lean mice,
consistent with previous studies (17), and this also did not change
following pyruvate injection (Fig. 4C).
To determine the role of sympathetic innervation of BAT in
the ability of lean mice to avoid pyruvate-induced torpor, we
chemically denervated BAT in lean mice by the injection of
6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the tissue to destroy dopa-
minergic and noradrenergic nerve fibers. Indeed, 2 wk after in-
jection, there was a >95% reduction of norepinephrine (NE)
content and an 80% reduction in UCP1 protein levels in the
BAT of 6-OHDA–injected mice (Fig. S3 B and C). In contrast to
the lack of effect in controls, administration of pyruvate in
6-OHDA BAT-denervated lean mice led to a significant decrease
in Tb (Fig. 4D) and to torpor-like behavior with a marked de-
crease in activity level (Movie S1). Interestingly, BAT-denervated
lean mice also failed to increase UCP1 levels in response to py-
ruvate as observed in normal lean mice (Fig. S3D). Chemical de-
nervation of BAT, on the other hand, had no effect on the ability
of pyruvate to increase blood glucose (Fig. 4E). Taken together,
these data show that SNS-mediated induction of UCP1 in the
BAT of lean mice is an important defense mechanism to maintain
thermogenesis and prevent torpor.
Thermoneutrality Blunts Pyruvate-Induced Torpor. In mice housed
at thermoneutral conditions (30 °C), pyruvate induced a drop in
Tb and activity in genetically obese db/db and ob/ob mice (Fig. 5
A and B) but not in lean mice; however, the decrease was
dampened compared with that observed in mice housed at 22 °C
(1.5 vs. 4 °C, respectively, 6 h after pyruvate administration).
Pyruvate induced a small increase in blood glucose in lean, ob/ob,
and db/db mice (Fig. S3E), and this glucose response was also
blunted compared with the increased glucose levels observed
when pyruvate was administered at 22 °C. As expected, housing
both lean C57BL/6 and obese db/db mice at thermoneutrality for
5 d before the pyruvate challenge resulted in decreased levels of
UCP1 in BAT (Fig. S3F). UCP1 levels were not changed by
pyruvate administration in C57BL/6, db/db, or ob/ob mice housed
at thermoneutrality (Fig. S3G).
Pyruvate-Induced Torpor in DIO Mice Relies on Adenosine Receptors
but Does Not Depend on Central Pyruvate or Brain Insulin Resistance.
Adenosine signaling has been shown to play a role in fasting-
induced torpor. Indeed, administration of aminophylline, an
adenosine receptor antagonist, blocks the induction of fasting-
induced torpor in lean mice (18) and stimulates thermogenesis in
rats (19). To determine whether pyruvate-induced torpor in
obese mice might be mediated via adenosine receptors, lean and
HFD-obese mice were pretreated with saline or aminophylline
before pyruvate administration. In HFD-obese mice, aminoph-
ylline significantly blunted pyruvate-induced hypothermia (Fig.
5C). This occurred without affecting the rise in blood glucose,
i.e., increased gluconeogenesis (Fig. S4A). By contrast, ami-
nophylline had no effect on Tb in lean mice injected with pyru-
vate (Fig. S4B) or on UCP1 activation in lean or DIO mice
receiving pyruvate (Fig. S4C).
Exogenous pyruvate can cross the blood–brain barrier and is a
potent energy substrate for neurons in vivo (20). To determine if
the effect of pyruvate was due to a direct action in the central
nervous system, we injected pyruvate into the lateral ventricle
and monitored intrascapular Tb. Direct intracerebroventricular
(i.c.v.) injection of pyruvate did not significantly affect Tb or
activity levels in chow-fed or DIO mice (although there was a
nonsignificant difference in basal temperature levels between the
control and pyruvate groups) (Fig. S5 A and B). Interestingly, i.c.v.
injection of pyruvate did increase blood glucose levels in DIO
mice (Fig. S5C), suggesting that increasing pyruvate levels in the
CNS could affect control of hepatic glucose output, possibly by
agouti-related protein (AgRP) neurons in the hypothalamus
(21). Since both HFD and genetically obese mice have been
shown to have insulin resistance in the brain (22, 23), we tested
whether the induction of torpor was dependent on brain insulin
signaling by examining the effect of peripheral pyruvate injection
in NIRKO mice, i.e., mice in which the insulin receptor is
knocked out on both neuronal and glial cells in brain (24). Py-
ruvate injection in NIRKO mice increased blood glucose levels

 to a similar degree as observed in lean mice (Fig. S6A). Pyruvate
did not induce hypothermia or affect activity in these mice (Fig.
S6 B and C), although there was a difference in basal tempera-
ture between mice injected with saline and pyruvate.
Pyruvate-Induced Torpor Affects Brain Metabolite Levels. To better
understand the role of brain metabolism during pyruvate-
induced torpor, we used MALDI-MS imaging to assess metab-
olite levels in brain regions important for energy homeostasis,
metabolism, and regulation of vital functions, including the hy-
pothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, cortex, and thalamus. This
revealed that overnight fasting alone induced an increase in both
pyruvate and lactate levels in the brain of lean mice, especially in
the cortex (Fig. 6 A and B and Fig. S7 A and B). Surprisingly, 2 h
after pyruvate administration to fasting animals, there was a
significant decrease in CNS levels of pyruvate and lactate to
levels equal to those in random-fed lean mice, indicating some
peripheral–central counterregulation mechanism. This was con-
firmed by direct measurement in the cortex of chow-fed mice,
which showed decreases of pyruvate and lactate levels at both
5 min and 2 h after pyruvate administration (Fig. S7 C and D). By
contrast, levels of hexose bisphosphate and GABA, a major in-
hibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, were not altered by fasting
or pyruvate administration in chow-fed mice (Fig. 6 C and D and
Fig. S7 E and F).
In DIO mice, a different pattern of central metabolism was
observed. Thus, neither fasting nor pyruvate injection altered
CNS pyruvate and lactate levels (Fig. 6 A and B and Fig. S7 A
and B), but hexose bisphosphate levels were significantly de-
creased after pyruvate injection, both in the whole brain and in
specific areas such as the cortex (Fig. S7 E and F). In addition,
fasting significantly decreased GABA in the hypothalamus of
obese mice, and this was restored to fed levels following pyruvate
administration (Fig. 6 C and D). These changes were confirmed
by direct measurement of GABA in hypothalamic samples of
DIO mice 5 min and 2 h after pyruvate administration (Fig. S8A).
GABA has been shown to modulate the expression of major hy-
pothalamic neurotransmitters, such as AgRP, neuropeptide Y
(NPY), pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), and the cocaine- and
amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) (25). As expected,
in DIO mice, mRNA levels of POMC and CART were increased,
and those of AgRP and NPY were decreased, but these did not
change further following pyruvate injection (Fig. S8B).
Discussion
Many vertebrate animals, including mammals, respond to harsh
environmental conditions by entering into states in which met-
abolic rate and Tb drop to conserve energy for survival. De-
pending on their depth and duration, these states are referred
to as “torpor” or “hibernation” (2). In the present study, we show
that pyruvate induces a state of torpor with profound hypo-
thermia and markedly decreased activity and metabolism in mice
with either HFD- or genetically induced obesity. The effect of
pyruvate depends on the degree of obesity, with the heaviest
mice having the lowest core Tb. While most DIO mice endure
the hypothermia and low respiratory rate and recover sponta-
neously, in db/db and ob/ob mice, which are even more obese and
metabolically unhealthy, torpor can persist for more than 7 h and
lead to death. The induction of torpor in obese mice is due to a
loss of BAT-mediated thermogenesis, which protects lean mice from
pyruvate-induced torpor. Consistent with this, pyruvate can induce
torpor in lean mice in which BAT has been denervated, whereas
housing at thermoneutrality blunts the phenotype in obese mice.
Mechanistically, pyruvate-induced torpor is mediated by pathways in-
volving adenosine and GABA signaling in the central nervous system.
One striking finding of this study is the dissociation between
energy balance and induction of torpor by pyruvate. Thus, torpor
is usually observed in states of low energy availability. Indeed, in
lean mice, torpor is induced by an overnight fast (present study
and ref. 9) but not by pyruvate administration. Other small

 molecules previously shown to induce torpor in lean mice are
metabolic inhibitors, such as 2-deoxyglucose, a nonmetabolizable
glucose analog that mimics hypoglycemia (6), and hydrogen
sulfide, which blocks mitochondrial complex IV activity and in-
hibits oxidative phosphorylation in mice (7). By contrast, HFD-
obese mice do not undergo torpor following an overnight fast
(present study and ref. 26) but do go into a state of profound
torpor after injection of pyruvate, an energy-rich substrate. Fi-
nally, pyruvate induces torpor in genetically obese db/db and ob/
ob mice, but, in contrast to DIO mice and like lean mice, these
mice also enter torpor upon fasting (even more severe than in
lean mice). Hence, the effects of pyruvate and fasting in inducing
torpor in mice depend on both the presence or absence of
obesity and the nature of the obesity.
While pyruvate is a known precursor for glucose production,
our data show that pyruvate-induced torpor is discrete from the
actions of pyruvate as a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis.
Consistent with our findings, previous studies have suggested an
interaction between obesity and torpor/hibernation. For in-
stance, mammals actively terminate the torpor state by in-
creasing internal heat production, and body mass has been
shown to be inversely related to rewarming following hibernation
or torpor in a range of mammalian species (27). The role played
by body fat in the mechanisms underlying torpor is unknown but
has been suggested to involve leptin or FGF21. In the present
study, neither leptin nor FGF21 was affected by pyruvate, so they
are not likely mediators. It is possible that other signaling mol-
ecules produced in fat facilitate the induction of torpor; however,
more research will be required to identify such signals.
Pyruvate-induced torpor in obese mice is associated with a
deficit in BAT thermogenesis. Indeed, in lean mice, which do not
undergo torpor after pyruvate administration, pyruvate induces
an increase of UCP1 protein, the major regulator of BAT-driven
thermogenesis. In contrast to adrenergic regulation of UCP1,
pyruvate induction appears to occur primarily at a posttranscrip-
tional level. Nonetheless, sympathetic denervation of BAT decreases
basal UCP1 levels in lean mice and blunts the pyruvate-induced
increased in UCP1 protein; as a result, pyruvate induces a fall in
core Tb in these mice. This is accompanied by a drop in spon-
taneous activity, which is likely a consequence of the drop in Tb
rather than a separate function, as UCP1-knockout mice have
normal physical activity (28). By contrast to lean mice, pyruvate
administration does not change UCP1 protein levels in obese
mice, which already have a defective BAT function. Indeed, both
DIO and genetically obese mice have an impaired thermogenic
response to cold (17) as well as mitochondrial alterations, in-
flammation, and insulin resistance in BAT (29, 30). In addition,
housing obese mice at thermoneutrality, which minimizes BAT
thermogenic capacity and turns off sympathetic nervous tone,
blunts pyruvate-induced torpor, although pyruvate still induces
a modest decrease in Tb and activity. Pyruvate-induced torpor
in obese mice also relies on adenosine signaling, as shown by
the protective effect of aminophylline, an adenosine recep-
tor antagonist. This appears to be independent of UCP1, al-
though under some conditions adenosine can directly activate
BAT (31). Consistent with this, peripheral stimulation of the A3
adenosine receptor (32) and central stimulation of the A1 aden-
osine receptor (33) trigger hypothermia in mice. This mecha-
nism is different from the one underlying fasting-induced torpor in
lean mice, which does not rely on A1 or A3 adenosine receptor
signaling (33).
DIO mice have increased circulating pyruvate levels, and this
pyruvate can be metabolized into lactate and glucose. In addi-
tion, injection of exogenous pyruvate leads to higher levels of
pyruvate, lactate, and glucose in DIO mice than in lean mice.
This can be explained by the reduction of pyruvate metabolism in
obesity and diabetes because of the inhibition of pyruvate de-
hydrogenase by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (34). As both
lean and obese mice exhibit rises in blood glucose, but only the
obese mice go into torpor, the induction of torpor is not de-
pendent on hepatic glucose release or diminished glucose stor-
age. However, central pyruvate injection does not induce torpor
in DIO mice, indicating its peripheral metabolism in the in-
duction of torpor. Interestingly, pyruvate injected centrally does
produce a rise in blood glucose in DIO mice, suggesting that part
of the glycemic response following pyruvate administration is
due to an effect in the CNS to regulate hepatic glucose output,
possibly through activation of AgRP neurons (21). This is not
surprising, as lactate metabolized centrally also affects peripheral
glucose homeostasis (35). MALDI-MS imaging data show that
brain pyruvate and lactate levels increase with fasting in lean
mice, consistent with previous findings suggesting that pyruvate
is an excellent substrate for neuronal TCA cycle activity (20) and
that fasting increases pyruvate uptake in the brain (20). In ad-
dition, hexose bisphosphate levels are significantly decreased
after pyruvate injection in HFD-obese mice, suggesting de-
creased glycolysis in brain.
Pyruvate-induced torpor in DIO mice is paralleled with in-
creased levels of GABA in the hypothalamus. Other studies have
shown that about 20% of brain GABA is labeled following i.v.
injection of 13C-labeled pyruvate, indicating that pyruvate can
serve as a precursor for this major inhibitory neurotransmitter
(20). In the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, there is a set of
warm-sensitive GABAergic neurons that have a robust effect on
Tb (36), and optogenetic activation (36) or injection of a GABAA
receptor agonist into this area induces a torpor-like state in rats
(37). Thus, it is likely that the pyruvate-induced increase in
GABA in DIO mice results in an increased firing rate of these
neurons, which would provoke the inhibition of adaptive ther-
mogenesis in the BAT and induce hypothermia. Many neuro-
peptides can affect GABA signaling at post- or presynaptic
sites (38), but the major hypothalamic neuropeptides (CART,
POMC, NPY, AgRP) are not affected by pyruvate in DIO mice,
at least at the gene-expression level. This suggests that other

 hypothalamic nuclei, such as those in the paraventricular nucleus
or the dorsomedial hypothalamus, have an important role in the
modulation of thermogenic responses (39). The specific targets
of GABA signaling and which metabolites affect its activity re-
main to be determined. MALDI-MS imaging provides the levels
of many other identified metabolites, such as IMP, AMP, cAMP,
ATP, UMP, and glutamate, which do not change significantly
with pyruvate injection.
In summary, systemic administration of pyruvate induces tor-
por, with a marked reduction of Tb, activity, and metabolism, in
diet-induced and genetically obese mice. This is dependent upon
a lack of normal BAT activation, which occurs in lean animals.
Our data show that adenosine and GABA signaling in brain are
involved in the effects of pyruvate on thermogenesis and me-
tabolism. Targeting the mechanisms underlying this regulated
induction of torpor could provide a new approach for inducing a
hypometabolic state, which could be beneficial in reducing is-
chemia–reperfusion injuries (40) and for organ preservation in
surgical situations (41).
Methods
Mice. Male C57BL/6J, ob/ob, and db/db mice (6–12 wk old) were purchased
from Jackson Laboratory. NIRKO mice were bred as described previously
(24). All mice were housed at 22 °C on a 12-h light/dark cycle. For the
thermoneutrality experiment, mice were housed at 30 °C for 5 d before
injections. Experiments complied with the regulations of the National In-
stitutes of Health and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center (no. 97-05).
Injection of Pyruvate and Aminophylline. Pyruvate (Sigma) dissolved in sterile
saline was administered i.p. (2 g/kg body weight). All injections took place
around 9 AM, either after an overnight fast (∼18 h) or in a random-fed state.
Aminophylline [20 mg/kg (42)] was injected 10 min before pyruvate or
saline administration.
Metabolic Measurements. Intrascapular Tb was measured using a telemetry sys-
tem, and core Tb was measured using a RET-3 rectal probe. Glucose levels were
measured in tail vein blood using infinity glucose monitors (US Diagnostics).
Blood pH was measured in whole blood using a pH microelectrode. Whole-body
energy expenditure was measured at ambient temperature (∼22 °C) using a
Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (Columbus Instruments).
Diets, telemetric measurements, chemical sympathectomy, Western blot,
qPCR analysis, analytical procedures, brain i.c.v. injection, MALDI-MS brain
imaging, and statistics are detailed in SI Methods.
