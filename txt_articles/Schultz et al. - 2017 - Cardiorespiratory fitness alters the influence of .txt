Cardiorespiratory fitness alters the
influence of a polygenic risk score on
biomarkers of AD
ABSTRACT
Objective: To examine whether a polygenic risk score (PRS) derived from APOE4, CLU, and
ABCA7 is associated with CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology and whether
higher cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) modifies the association between the PRS and CSF
biomarkers.
Methods: Ninety-five individuals from the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention were
included in these cross-sectional analyses. They were genotyped for APOE4, CLU, and ABCA7,
from which a PRS was calculated for each participant. The participants underwent lumbar punc-
ture for CSF collection. b-Amyloid 42 (Ab42), Ab40, total tau (t-tau), and phosphorylated tau (p-
tau) were quantified by immunoassays, and Ab42/Ab40 and tau/Ab42 ratios were computed. CRF
was estimated from a validated equation incorporating sex, age, body mass index, resting heart
rate, and self-reported physical activity. Covariate-adjusted regression analyses were used to
test for associations between the PRS and CSF biomarkers. In addition, by including a PRS3CRF
term in the models, we examined whether these associations were modified by CRF.
Results: A higher PRS was associated with lower Ab42/Ab40 (p , 0.001), higher t-tau/Ab42 (p 5
0.012), and higher p-tau/Ab42 (p 5 0.040). Furthermore, we observed PRS 3 CRF interactions for
Ab42/Ab40 (p 5 0.003), t-tau/Ab42 (p 5 0.003), and p-tau/Ab42 (p 5 0.001). Specifically, the asso-
ciation between the PRS and these CSF biomarkers was diminished in those with higher CRF.
Conclusions: In a late-middle-aged cohort, CRF attenuates the adverse influence of genetic vulner-
ability on CSF biomarkers. These findings support the notion that increased cardiorespiratory fitness
may be beneficial to those at increased genetic risk for AD. Neurology® 2017;88:1650–1658

The APOE4 gene is a well-established genetic risk factor for cholesterol dysmetabolism1 and
cerebral b-amyloidosis in late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD).2 Recently, genome-wide associa-
tion studies have suggested additional candidate genes associated with AD,3 including clusterin
(CLU) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7), which, like APOE4, are also involved
in cholesterol metabolism.4 The implication of APOE4, CLU, and ABCA7 in AD and choles-
terol metabolism suggests that aberrant cholesterol processing might contribute to AD suscep-
tibility. Previous studies support this notion by demonstrating an effect of these risk variants on
AD biomarkers.5–7
Although the study of genetic variants in isolation has provided information on the distinct
effects of genetic risk factors, interrogating such variants in aggregate is critical for understanding

 the involvement of specific pathways in AD
etiology.1,7–9 Indeed, pathways linked to late-
onset AD, including cholesterol metabolism,
serve as promising targets for pharmacologic
and nonpharmacologic interventions.4,8
Emerging evidence indicates that modifi-
able lifestyle factors such as physical activity
may protect against the effect of genetic sus-
ceptibility on AD pathophysiology.10 In addi-
tion,
it
is
unknown
whether
increased
cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) can modify
a pathway-specific genetic effect on bio-
markers of AD.
Therefore, we investigated whether a choles-
terol metabolism polygenic risk score (PRS) is
associated with CSF biomarkers of AD in an
asymptomatic late-middle-aged cohort. We
further sought to examine whether this associ-
ation varies as a function of CRF.
METHODS Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents. The University of Wisconsin Institu-
tional Review Board approved all study procedures, and each par-
ticipant provided signed informed consent before participation.
Participants. Participants in this study were recruited from the
Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP) study.11
The WRAP study consists of .1,500 individuals who either were
recruited from the community or were adult children of patients
with AD seen in various University of Wisconsin dementia clin-
ics. Participants are compensated for their participation in the
WRAP study and in affiliated biomarker studies such as the
one from which we obtained data presented in this report.
Table e-1 at Neurology.org details background characteristics of
the full WRAP cohort vis-à-vis our study sample.
For our analyses, participants were included on the basis of
having undergone genotyping for APOE4, CLU, and ABCA7;
being of self-reported European ancestry, which was confirmed
with principal components genetic analyses,12 to bolster the
genetic homogeneity of the study sample, having self-reported
physical activity (SR-PA) measurements, and having undergone
lumbar puncture for collection of CSF. Additional inclusion cri-
teria included intact performance on a comprehensive battery of
neuropsychological tests (table e-2). Exclusion criteria included
significant neurologic disease, psychiatric disorders, and untreated
hypertension. These criteria resulted in a sample of 95
participants.
CRF measure. Although graded exercise testing (GXT) is the
gold standard for assessing CRF, barriers to its implementation
among older adults remain.13 Therefore, recent work has focused
on developing non-GXT estimates of CRF using variables that are
both clinically available and known to have an effect on CRF.
One widely used formula for deriving such non-GXT estimates of
CRF is as follows: CRF 5 18.07 1 sex (2.77) 2 age (0.10) –
BMI (0.17) 2 resting heart rate (0.03) 1 SR-PA, where BMI is
body mass index and with sex coded as female 5 0 and male 5
1.13 As described previously,14 SR-PA was derived from the
moderate intensity physical activity question from the Women’s
Health Initiative physical activities questionnaire.15,16 Briefly, this
question inquires about the frequency and duration of engage-
ment in moderate, “not exhausting,” physical activity per week.
Following established protocol,15,16 frequency and duration were
multiplied to create a minutes per week measure of moderate-
intensity physical activity (range 0–240 minutes). We further
scaled this SR-PA measure by 30 so that each additional unit
(range 0–8) captured the incremental effect of 30 minutes of
activity as opposed to the effect of 1 minute of activity.17 Lastly,
this SR-PA variable had a skewed distribution that we corrected
via Blom18 transformation before inclusion in the CRF estimate.
Genotyping. DNA collection, genotyping, and quality control.
DNA was extracted from whole-blood samples with the PUREGENE
DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems, Inc, Minneapolis, MN).
DNA concentrations were quantified with ultraviolet spectro-
photometry (DU 530 Spectrophotometer; Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for
CLU (rs9331896), ABCA7 (rs4147929), and APOE4 (rs429358
and rs7412) were genotyped by LGC Genomics (Beverly, MA),
implementing competitive allele-specific PCR-based KASP
genotyping assays. Duplicate quality control samples were
placed randomly throughout all 96-well plates. The genotype

 concordance rate was 99.89%. All discordant genotypes were set
to missing. Further quality control was conducted with PLINK
version 1.07.19 Variants examined in this analysis did not deviate
from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium with a Bonferroni-adjusted p
value threshold of 0.05. Genetic variants were coded additively
according to the number of risk alleles.
Polygenic risk score. A PRS was calculated from the following
equation: PRSi 5 Pk
n 5 llnðORnÞ 3 Cn, where i represents the
individual, whose score is calculated by summing over all SNPs; n
is in the pathway ranging from l to k; OR is the odds ratio of the
SNP n; and C is the individual’s count of risk alleles for SNP n.20
If the minor allele was protective, as was the case for CLU, the
inverse of the OR was used instead. SNP ORs for CLU and
ABCA7 were taken from the International Genomics of Alz-
heimer’s Project meta-analysis.3 Risk due to APOE4 was calcu-
lated additively with the use of an OR of 3.68, as reported in
AlzGene.21 Furthermore, as a result of the inherent bimodal clus-
tering of the PRS in our sample, we opted to dichotomize this
variable into low and high PRS groups, PRS , 1.0 and PRS $
1.0, respectively.
CSF assessment. Lumbar puncture for collection of CSF was
performed the morning after a 12-hour fast, with a Sprotte 24-
or 25-gauge spinal needle at L3-4 or L4-5 using gentle extraction
into polypropylene syringes. Each sample consisted of 22 mL
CSF, which was then combined, mixed, and centrifuged at
2,000g for 10 minutes. Supernatants were frozen in 0.5-mL ali-
quots in polypropylene tubes and stored at 2808C.
CSF levels of b-amyloid 42 (Ab42) and Ab40 were quanti-
fied by electrochemiluminescence with an Ab triplex assay
(MSD Human Ab peptide Ultra-Sensitive Kit, Meso Scale Dis-
covery, Gaithersburg, MD). CSF Ab42 was also quantified,
along with total-tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated-tau (p-tau),
with a sandwich ELISA (INNOTEST Ab1-42, hTAU-Ag, and
Phospho-Tau[181P], respectively; Fujirebio Europe, Ghent,
Belgium). All measurements were performed in one round of
analyses with one batch of reagents by board-certified labora-
tory technicians who were blinded to clinical data and used
protocols accredited by the Swedish Board for Accreditation
and Conformity Assessment, as previously described.22 We
computed an Ab42/Ab40 ratio using the triplex assay values
and t-tau/Ab42 and p-tau/Ab42 ratios using the INNOTEST
assay values. The Ab42/Ab40 ratio, rather than Ab42 by itself,
was adopted as our measure of Ab burden because it normalizes
Ab42 concentration to a measure of overall amyloidogenic pro-
cessing by amyloid precursor protein, making it possible to
detect low Ab42 in high-Ab producers and vice versa.23 The
mean 6 SD time interval between CSF sampling and the
WRAP visit at which components of the CRF estimate were
obtained was 6.5 6 5.1 months.
Statistical analyses. To investigate whether the cholesterol
metabolism PRS is associated with CSF biomarkers of AD, we fit-
ted a series of linear regression models, one for each CSF bio-
marker, that were adjusted for age and sex. Because CLU and
ABCA7 are known to convey modest genetic effects compared
with APOE4,8 we additionally sought to better understand the
incremental utility of the PRS vs APOE4 alone by conducting
sensitivity analyses.
Because we were interested in whether CRF attenuates the
relationship between the cholesterol metabolism PRS and CSF
biomarkers, we additionally refitted the original models while
incorporating an interaction between the PRS and CRF. When
significant, this interaction term would indicate that the deleteri-
ous effect of a higher PRS on the biomarker is modified by CRF.

 To elucidate the relative contribution of each CRF compo-
nent to the moderating effect of CRF, we examined models that
tested interactions between each component of the CRF estimate
(i.e., age, sex, resting heart rate, BMI, and SR-PA) and the PRS.
For all analyses conducted, evaluations of assumptions for ordi-
nary least squares were carried out via graphic analyses.24 All
analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS, version 21.0. Only
findings with values of p # 0.05 (2-tailed) were considered to
be significant.
RESULTS Participant characteristics. As shown in
table 1, participants were predominately female
(67.4%) with a mean 6 SD age of 61.2 6 6.0 years.
Overall, participants were slightly overweight (BMI
28.9 6 5.6 kg/m2) and reported engaging in 52.3 6
70.8 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity
per week.
Associations between the PRS and CSF biomarkers. The
PRS was associated (B [95% confidence interval], p)
with CSF measures of Ab42/Ab40 (20.015 [20.022
to 20.008], ,0.001), t-tau/Ab42 (0.126 [0.029–
0.224], 0.012), and p-tau/Ab42 (0.013 [0.001–
0.026], 0.040) but not with t-tau (4.166 [244.578
to 52.911], 0.866) or p-tau (22.509 [28.696 to
3.677], 0.422). Adjusted mean 6 SE biomarker val-
ues for the high PRS group vis-à-vis the low PRS
group are shown in figure 1, A–E.
Sensitivity analyses. For our sensitivity analyses, we
first recalculated the PRS after excluding APOE4 to
assess whether APOE4 could be driving the observed
associations.
When
we
tested
the
relationship
between this recalculated PRS and the CSF bio-
markers, we found no associations (p . 0.085). How-
ever,
APOE4
alone
was
associated
(B
[95%
confidence interval], p) with Ab42/Ab40 (20.014
[20.023 to 20.000], 0.004), t-tau/Ab42 (0.124
[0.027–0.224],
0.013),
and
p-tau/Ab42
(0.013
[0.000–0.026], 0.042). While these findings might
suggest that APOE4 drove the initial findings, we
additionally performed nested likelihood tests inves-
tigating the fit of the model with APOE4 vs the model
without APOE4. These tests revealed that the model
with APOE4 fits significantly better compared to the
model without APOE4 for Ab42/Ab40 (x2 [df 5 1] 5
15.45, p , 0.001) and t-tau/Ab42 (x2 [df 5 1] 5
5.70, p , 0.017). However, the model with APOE4
did not fit better than the model without APOE4 for
p-tau/Ab42 (x2 [df 5 1] 5 3.73, p 5 0.054).
CRF, PRS, and CSF biomarkers. There were PRS 3
CRF interactions (B [95% confidence interval], p) for
Ab42/Ab40 (0.005 [0.002–0.008], 0.003), t-tau/
Ab42 (20.069 [20.113 to 20.025], 0.003), and
p-tau/Ab42 (20.010 [20.015 to 20.004], 0.001),

 as reported in table 2. Covariate-adjusted means for
low vs high PRS groups at low vs high CRF levels
were plotted for each biomarker examined. These
graphs, shown in figure 2, A–E, revealed that the
adverse change in CSF biomarkers due to a higher
PRS was evident in the low CRF group but muted in
the high CRF group.
To investigate the extent to which these findings
may be driven by other potential confounders, we
reran these models after additionally adjusting for
years of education, high-density lipoprotein choles-
terol, history of smoking, diabetes mellitus, and
hypertension. There remained PRS 3 CRF interac-
tions (B [95% confidence interval], p) for Ab42/Ab40
(0.005 [0.002–0.009], 0.003), t-tau/Ab42 (20.071
[20.118 to 20.023], 0.004), and p-tau/Ab42
(20.010 [20.016 to 20.004], 0.002).
Prior studies have used alternative CRF estimate
equations that included factors such as smoking his-
tory and ethnicity.25 To understand whether our re-
sults were dependent on the specific CRF estimate
measure used, we recalculated our CRF estimate
using an alternative formula,25 i.e., CRF 5 77.41
2 age (0.37) 2 BMI (0.91) 2 resting heart rate
(0.07) 1 SR-PA quintile 1 ethnicity (8.032) 2
smoking status (1.976), with smoking status coded
as never 5 0 and ex-smoker or current smoker 5 1
and ethnicity coded as nonwhite 5 0 and white 5 1.
After we refitted our model with this recalculated
CRF estimate, our results remained essentially
unchanged. There were PRS 3 CRF interactions (B
[95% confidence interval], p) for Ab42/Ab40 (0.001
[0.000–0.001],
0.037),
t-tau/Ab42
(20.017
[20.032 to 20.001], 0.034), and p-tau/Ab42
(20.003 [20.005 to 20.001], 0.011) but not for
t-tau (23.212 [211.061 to 4.637], 0.418) or p-tau
(20.686 [21.675 to 0.303], 0.172).
Component analyses. Our interrogation of the CRF
components (table 3) revealed BMI 3 PRS interac-
tions for t-tau/Ab42 and p-tau/Ab42; SR-PA 3 PRS
interactions for Ab42/Ab40, t-tau/Ab42, and p-tau/
Ab42; and a sex 3 PRS interaction for t-tau/Ab42. In
summary, having lower BMI, having higher SR-PA,
and being male attenuated the deleterious effect of the
PRS on CSF biomarkers.
Supplementary analyses. In addition to our objectives
of primary interest, we examined the following sec-
ondary objectives. First, we investigated whether
there was a main effect of CRF on CSF biomarkers,
without
differentiating
by
genetic
vulnerability.
These
analyses
revealed
no
associations
(p
.
0.490). We also tested for, and failed to find, an
association between the PRS and CRF (p 5 0.576).
Lastly, because interactions between APOE4 and
lifestyle measures have been previously studied,10

 whereas the same is not true for ABCA7 and CLU, we
sought to understand how CRF influences the asso-
ciation of ABCA7 and CLU independently on CSF
biomarkers. To do this, we additionally fitted models
to test an ABCA7 3 CRF interaction and a CLU 3
CRF interaction on CSF biomarkers. We found that
while CLU did not interact with CRF to predict CSF
biomarkers (p . 0.192), ABCA7 and CRF had a mod-
est interaction (B [95% confidence interval], p) for
t-tau/Ab42 (20.035 [20.072 to 0.001], 0.060) and
p-tau/Ab42 (20.004 [20.009 to 0.000], 0.064).
DISCUSSION This study showed that, in a late-
middle-aged cohort, a cholesterol metabolism PRS
derived from APOE4, CLU, and ABCA7 is associated
with hallmark pathophysiologic features of AD.
Specifically, individuals with a higher PRS had
reduced Ab42/Ab40 and elevated t-tau/Ab42 and p-
tau/Ab42 compared to those with a lower PRS.
Overall, these findings indicate that cholesterol
metabolism genes may contribute additively to
interindividual variation in these biomarkers. We
observed that CRF modified this genetic-related
alteration in these CSF biomarkers. That is, the
adverse influence of the PRS on the CSF biomarkers
was muted among those with higher CRF. We fur-
ther found that BMI, SR-PA, and sex contributed to
the moderating effect of CRF.
There is a well-established relationship between
APOE4 allele carriership and Ab accumulation.10,26–28
For example, a prior study28 found that cognitively
normal APOE4 carriers had lower CSF Ab42 than
noncarriers. Likewise, in WRAP, we have shown that
late-middle-aged APOE4 carriers had higher Ab accu-
mulation, measured by Pittsburgh compound B-PET
imaging compared to noncarriers.16,29 Additionally, it
is well established that APOE4 carriers have higher
serum cholesterol levels than APOE3 or APOE2 car-
riers.30 Taken together, one proposed mechanism for
the pathogenic contributions of APOE4 in AD is that
it may influence Ab accumulation through its role in
central and peripheral cholesterol transport.1
Relatedly, CLU is involved in lipid transport and
is associated with AD susceptibility in recent genome-
wide association studies.3 However, its role in Ab
accumulation is less understood. A previous study
found an association between CLU and CSF Ab42
levels in individuals with AD, even after accounting
for APOE4 status.6 In contrast, one study7 reported
no association between a CLU risk variant and Ab
burden. The disparity in these findings might be due
to the distinct populations examined; as our study
suggests, perhaps it is a result of dissimilar CRF in
these populations. Furthermore, ABCA7 encodes
a protein that functions as a cholesterol efflux regula-
tor, and there is recent evidence for an association

 between ABCA7 and AD pathophysiology. For exam-
ple, in a population of cognitively normal elderly, the
risk variant of ABCA7 was associated with a .2-fold
increase in the odds of being Ab positive.7
We extend these aforementioned findings by
showing associations between a cholesterol metabo-
lism PRS (comprising CLU, APOE4, and ABCA7
SNPs) and CSF biomarkers of AD. These data, in
combination with the prior studies,6,7,31,32 strengthen
the knowledge base suggesting that disordered cho-
lesterol metabolism may play a crucial role in AD,
beginning as early as late middle age. Our sensitivity
analyses revealed that assessing the genetic role of
cholesterol metabolism processes without APOE4
yielded no associations with CSF biomarkers. While
these results may suggest that APOE4 plays the dom-
inant role in the cholesterol metabolism pathway of
AD, we further observed that the PRS derived from
APOE4 and CLU increased model fitness for CSF
measures relative to APOE4 alone. The findings
underscore the potential value of examining the poly-
genic, rather than the individual, effect of genetic risk
variants on CSF biomarkers.
There is emerging interest in the effect of a physi-
cally active lifestyle on genetic-related risk for AD.
An earlier study10 reported that highly active APOE4
carriers had less Ab deposition compared to their inac-
tive peers. Additional groups have found that physical
activity attenuates the detrimental effect of other
genetic polymorphisms on cognitive function33,34 and
brain volume.35 In the present study, we found that
higher CRF counteracted the adverse influence of cho-
lesterol metabolism polymorphisms on CSF bio-
markers of AD. In addition, SR-PA, BMI, and sex
were found to moderate the effect of the PRS on
CSF biomarkers when we examined the components
of the CRF estimate. These observed statistical inter-
actions may reflect an underlying biological interaction
between cholesterol processing and lifestyle factors
(i.e., CRF, physical activity, and BMI) in the accumu-
lation of AD pathophysiology. Collectively, the extant
literature suggests that physical activity and higher
CRF may provide resilience for individuals at increased
genetic risk for AD. Our observation that lower BMI
benefited individuals at greater genetic vulnerability for
AD bolsters a recent report36 on the protective role of
healthy BMI in midlife vis-a-vis AD in later life. In
addition, our finding that men have diminished PRS-
related alterations in CSF biomarkers is in agreement
with epidemiologic studies showing that men are at
decreased risk for AD.37
The current study was not without limitations, the
most significant being the cross-sectional design,
which raised the possibility of reverse causality. A pro-
spective design will be critical in determining whether
fitness exerts a causal influence on AD-related
biomarkers in people at genetic risk of AD. Another
potential limitation is our use of a nonexercise esti-
mate of CRF in this study. However, we have previ-
ously shown a strong correspondence (r 5 0.76, p ,
0.001) between this nonexercise estimate and peak
oxygen consumption, the gold standard for assessing
CRF.14 Furthermore, while we adjusted for many
common cardiovascular risk factors in our analyses,
we may not have controlled for all potential con-
founds (e.g., dietary habits or family history of car-
diovascular disease). In addition, while our findings
highlight the potential benefits of investigating
genetic polymorphisms in aggregate, from a clinical
perspective, it may be infeasible to genotype patients
for multiple genetic variants. However, our findings
would be strengthened by replication in an indepen-
dent sample. In addition, future studies examining
whether
higher
CRF
modifies
the
association
between the PRS and other AD-related outcomes
such as cognition or neuroimaging measures would
complement our findings. Lastly, generalizability of
our findings might be somewhat limited because of
the restricted sample size and homogeneous demo-
graphic makeup (e.g., European ancestry).
Overall, we found that a cholesterol metabolism
PRS was adversely associated with CSF biomarkers of
AD and that this deleterious effect of the PRS is atten-
uated in individuals with higher CRF. These findings
suggest that leading a physically fit lifestyle may be
beneficial to those at increased genetic risk for AD.
