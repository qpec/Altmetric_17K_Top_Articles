Amyloid proteotoxicity initiates an inflammatory response
blocked by cannabinoids
Antonio Currais1, Oswald Quehenberger2,3, Aaron M Armando2, Daniel Daugherty1, Pam Maher1 and David Schubert1
The beta amyloid (Aβ) and other aggregating proteins in the brain increase with age and are frequently found within neurons.
The mechanistic relationship between intracellular amyloid, aging and neurodegeneration is not, however, well understood.
We use a proteotoxicity model based upon the inducible expression of Aβ in a human central nervous system nerve cell line to
characterize a distinct form of nerve cell death caused by intracellular Aβ. It is shown that intracellular Aβ initiates a toxic
inflammatory response leading to the cell's demise. Aβ induces the expression of multiple proinflammatory genes and an increase
in both arachidonic acid and eicosanoids, including prostaglandins that are neuroprotective and leukotrienes that potentiate death.
Cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol stimulate the removal of intraneuronal Aβ, block the inflammatory response, and are
protective. Altogether these data show that there is a complex and likely autocatalytic inflammatory response within nerve cells
caused by the accumulation of intracellular Aβ, and that this early form of proteotoxicity can be blocked by the activation of
cannabinoid receptors.

INTRODUCTION
Nerve cell death from the accumulation of aggregated or amyloid-
like proteins is a common theme in most age-dependent
neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are no drugs that
significantly inhibit cell death associated with Alzheimer’s disease
(AD), Parkinson’s or Huntington’s diseases. This could be because
most interest has been in the late manifestations of the disease,
not in the initial changes in cell metabolism that ultimately lead to
nerve cell death.1 In the context of life span, slowing down the
removal of aggregated proteins in the brains of flies shortens life
span, while expediting their rate of removal extends life span.2
Therefore, it is likely that the accumulation of intracellular
aggregated protein in the brain occurs throughout life, con-
tributes to cognitive aging, and may also be involved in the
initiation of many old age-associated diseases.
Although debated,3,4 the accumulation of intracellular amyloid
beta (Aβ) is an early event in AD. In both humans and rodents,
intracellular Aβ accumulation is observed well before extracellular
amyloid.5–8 Similarly, both aggregated huntingtin and alpha
synuclein are found in neurons before disease onset.9,10
As with the accumulation of intracellular proteins, central
nervous system (CNS) inflammation is elevated with age and
increases in disease.11As AD is associated with neuronal dysfunc-
tion, we hypothesized that proteotoxicity in nerve cells them-
selves may initiate an inflammatory response that can lead directly
to their death and contribute to overall inflammation in the CNS.
The following experiments identify the molecular basis of this
inflammatory response using a human CNS nerve cell line that
conditionally expresses Aβ.
RESULTS
MC65 cells are a human CNS nerve cell line that contains the C-99
fragment of the amyloid precursor protein under the control of a
tetracycline (tet)-sensitive promoter.12 The parent cell line is
SK-N-MC from a human brain tumor, and it has an electrically
excitable membrane typical of neurons.13 When tet is withdrawn,
cells express C-99 that is converted to Aβ by γ-secretase and the
cells die within 4 days (Figure 1a,b). Aβ remains within the cell and
forms aggregates.12,14 In the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors (SI),
cells accumulate C-99, but do not die, and C99 does not
aggregate.
Intraneuronal Aβ induces the expression of proinflammatory
molecules
Inflammation is associated with the elevated expression of
cytokines and chemokines. To assay for the expression of these
genes following the induction of Aβ in MC65 cells, the mRNA
expression of 184 inflammation-associated genes was assayed
sequentially for three days. Table 1 shows increases in the
expression of 12 genes.
IL-8 expression is linked to late onset AD.15 Importantly, IL-8
crosses the blood brain barrier and stimulates the recruitment of
immune cells into the brain.16 Aβ causes a 10-fold increase in IL-8
gene expression, and IL-8 is detected in the culture supernatant
2 days after the induction of Aβ (Table 1).
It was next asked whether the intracellular expression of Aβ
leads to an increase in proinflammatory pathways. NFkB is a
ubiquitous proinflammatory molecule whose activation includes
phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of its p65 subunit is increased
following the expression of Aβ in MC65 cells (Figure 1c,d).
Inflammation is also associated with the activation of caspase 1.
Figure 1c,d shows that following the expression of Aβ, caspase 1 is
activated as defined by the appearance of activation-dependent
cleavage products.
In cases of caspase-1 activation, cell death is ultimately caused
by caspase-3.17 Figure 1c also shows that caspase-3 is strongly

 activated on day 2 following the start of Aβ accumulation. The
caspase-1 inhibitor Z-YVAD-FMC (CPS 1) and the caspase-3
inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK (CPS 3), had no effect on Aβ levels
(Figure 1e and not shown), but reduced cell death (Figure 1f).
All proinflammatory responses were blocked by a γ secretase
inhibitor. Therefore, the expression of Aβ leads to the induction of
an inflammatory pathway and caspase dependent cell death.
Eicosanoids are derivatives of arachidonic acid (AA) or related
polyunsaturated fatty acids that have either pro- or anti-
inflammatory effects. Leukotrienes are made by lipoxygenases
(LOXs), while prostaglandins are synthesized by cyclooxygenases
(COXs). COX 1 is constitutively expressed; COX 2 is inducible under
conditions of stress.18 Figure 1c,d show that COX 2 expression is
increased by 2 days.

Cells were induced to make Aβ ( − tet) or not (+tet) for 48 h and the culture supernatant assayed for eicosanoids. Of the 164 eicosanoids
assayed, these were the only ones detected. In the same experiment, induced cells were treated with 1 μmol/l THC, 10 μmol/l Calbiochem

relative effects of SI, THC and CNB-001 were the same. Aβ, beta amyloid.

 toxicity, nor did the COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 or the generic COX
inhibitor Ketorolac (Keto; Supplementary Table S1); none altered
intracellular Aβ (Figure 1e). In contrast, the 5-LOX inhibitor
CNB-001 (CNB)14 and the 5-LOX-activating protein inhibitor
MK806 (MK) prevented the accumulation of Aβ and cell death
(Figure 1e,f).
Aβ-induced AA is derived from several lipases
Since the major substrate for LOXs and COXs is AA, it was asked
whether AA potentiates cell death. When induced to make Aβ in
the presence of AA, cells die in a dose-dependent manner in
2 days following Aβ expression rather than 4 days in control
cultures (Figure 1g). Linoleic acid is a precursor to AA and also a
substrate for LOXs, and it also potentiates toxicity (Figure 1g).
These data suggest that AA may be produced following Aβ
induction and that AA is a substrate for nerve cell death. Analysis
of AA after 3 days of Aβ induction showed between a two- and
threefold increase (2.5 ± 0.6, Po0.001 n = 5).
The physiology of a cell is very different when it is stressed
(in this case by proteotoxicity) as compared with its normal state.
Compounds that have no effect on non-stressed cells may engage
pathways that are induced by stress and therefore their action
may only be detected under stressful conditions. This is the case
with extracellular AA and in the following experiments where
the effect of pharmacological intervention is only observed in
Aβ-induced cells.
Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is the major source of AA in the brain
and contributes to AD pathology.21 The three forms in human
cells include Ca++ dependent (cPLA2), Ca++ independent (iPLA2)
and secretory (sPLA2). iPLA2 gene knockout AD mice have
reduced amyloid plaque load and improved behavior.22 In
humans, variants of the enzymes are risk factors for AD, and the
enzymes that metabolize AA are increased in AD and AD mice.21
Most AA in the brain is derived from iPLA2, but there are other
potential sources. MC65 cell death is partially prevented by the
broad-spectrum phospholipase A2 inhibitors 4-octadecyl benzyl
acrylic acid (OBAA) and chlorpromazine (Supplementary Table S1).
FkGk11, an iPLA2-specific inhibitor, reduces toxicity and intra-
cellular Aβ accumulation (Figure 1e,f), while the cPLA2 inhibitors
methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (MAFP), CAY10502, and
pyrrophene have no effect (Supplementary Table S1). The
sPLA2 inhibitor thioetheramide does not inhibit cell death at
Figure 3.

 concentrations effective in human cells.23 Therefore, the PLA2
inhibitors are only partially effective in preventing cell death.
Alternative sources of AA are triacylglycerols. The monoacylgly-
cerol lipase (MAGL) inhibitor JZL1 was inactive in reducing cell
death, as was the inhibitor of diacylglycerol lipase, RHC-80287
(Supplementary Table S1). However, the generic lipase inhibitor
CAY10499 and the triacylglycerol lipase inhibitors, tetrahydrolip-
statin (THL) and Atglistin, partially blocked toxicity (Supplementary
Table S1, Figure 1f). Although none of the lipase inhibitors
individually completely blocked toxicity, the combination of
FkGk11 and THL did (Figure 1f, Supplementary Table S1). In
addition, this combination reduces the increase in AA following
Aβ induction by (91 ± 6%, n = 3) and also blocks the accumulation
of Aβ (Figure 1e). Because of the profound effect of AA, it was
asked whether eicosanoids themselves have roles in the clearance
of intracellular Aβ and nerve cell death.
Intraneuronal Aβ increases eicosanoid production
When cells are stressed, they initially mount a protective response.
Twenty hrs after Aβ induction in MC65 cells, only increases in
prostaglandins PGD2 and PGE2 can be found in the cell culture
medium (not shown), but by 48 h there is a relatively simultaneous
expression of multiple prostaglandins and leukotrienes that is
blocked by a γ-secretase inhibitor or by CNB-001 (Figure 1h,
Figure 2). The genesis of the eicosanoids that are elevated
following Aβ induction is also shown.
Prostaglandins and leukotrienes have opposing effects on cell
death
The effect of the secreted eicosanoids on intracellular Aβ toxicity
were examined in two ways. First, each eicosanoid identified in
the culture medium was added to induced or uninduced cells
using a twofold serial dilution between 20 μmol/l and 10 nmol/l,
and it was determined whether the compound was either
neuroprotective, potentiated toxicity or was directly toxic. Second,
when possible, these data were confirmed by receptor antagonists
or agonists.
Figure 3a,b and Supplementary Table S2 show that PGE2 and
PGD2, are neuroprotective, whereas 5-HETE and its downstream
metabolites LTA4 and LTB4 potentiate toxicity. Fifteen HETE is not
reproducibly active, while 12 HETE is protective (Figure 3b).
However, none of the prostaglandins alter intracellular Aβ levels
at day 2, while 5-HETE stimulates Aβ accumulation (not shown).
The other eicosanoids lack activity (Supplementary Table S2).
Importantly, none of the eicosanoids were directly toxic to
uninduced MC65 cells.
Prostaglandin and leukotrienes interact with a large number of
receptors. PGE2 interacts with EP1–4. Supplementary Table S1
shows that the EP1 antagonist SC51089 and EP4 antagonists
HA23848 and GW627368X all potentiate Aβ toxicity. The EP4
antagonists were 10-fold more potent, suggesting the primary
involvement of EP4.
PGD2 signals through DP1 and DP2. It was asked whether
the DP1-selective agonist BW245C or the selective DP2 agonist
15-PGJ(2) were neuroprotective. Only BW245C was effective
(Supplementary Table S1), suggesting that PGD2 protection is
via DP1.
There are a large number of molecular targets for the
leukotrienes that are blocked by a γ-secretase inhibitor or by
CNB-001. Of these, the LTB4 receptors BLT1 and BLT2 are the best
studied. LTA4 and LTB4 potentiate Aβ toxicity themselves and the
BLT antagonist LY255283 is weakly protective (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2).
Cannabinoids remove intraneuronal Aβ
In addition to prostaglandins and leukotrienes, AA is a component
of a very large family of endocannabinoids (ECs) that are, in turn,
metabolized to AA. The EC arachidonoyl ethanol amide (AEA) is
expressed in the brain.24 The major cannabinoid receptors are CB1
and CB2, and AEA activates both. The data in Supplementary Table
S1 and Figure 3c,d show that AEA promotes MC65 survival and
blocks intracellular Aβ accumulation, as do its hydrolysis-stable
analogs arvanil (not shown) and AM404 (404) (Supplementary
Table S1, Figure 3c,d). UBR597, an inhibitor of the enzyme that
degrades AEA, is also protective (Supplementary Table S1) as is
the CB2 agonist Q-3 (Figure 3c,d, Supplementary Table S1).
Conversely, toxicity and Aβ accumulation are enhanced by CB1
and CB2 antagonists AM281, AM251 and AM630 (Supplementary
Table S1, Figure 3c,d). A number of additional CB1 and CB2
agonists or antagonists were assayed, but no pharmacological
distinction between CB1 and CB2 could be made (Supplementary
Table S1). Of the compounds tested, THC is the most potent CB-1
agonist, with an EC50 below 50 nmol/l (Figure 3e,f). THC is
protective, removes intraneuronal Aβ and completely eliminates
the elevated eicosanoid production in induced MC65 cells.

Cytokines potentiate toxicity and Aβ accumulation. MC65 cells were either uninduced (+) or induced ( − ) to make Aβ in the presence

 Inflammation is initiated in part via RAGE
Receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) interacts
with Aβ and can be expressed inside cells.25 As RAGE activation
induces an inflammatory response, we asked whether RAGE is
involved in Aβ-induced cell death. Figure 3g shows that a RAGE
inhibitor, FPS-ZMI, partially blocks cell death, and Figure 3h shows
that IL-8 secretion is also reduced by FPS-ZMI, as is intracellular Aβ
(Figure 3i). Knocking down RAGE with siRNA further supported the
results, showing a reduction in cell death, IL-8 secretion and Aβ
accumulation (Figure 3j–l). The reduction of RAGE expression also
blocked the activation of NFkB as determined by lowering its
phosphorylation to baseline levels (Figure 3l), but it did not
significantly reduce the expression of eicosanoids or alter AA
levels (not shown).
Extracellular proinflammatory cytokines also potentiate Aβ toxicity
The above data show that the death of neurons may be
progressively autocatalytic due to the production of a variety of
proinflammatory molecules. It was therefore asked whether the
cytokines enhance the rate of Aβ accumulation and death. MC65
cells were exposed to IL-8, IL-1β, IFNγ or TNFα for 2 days and
intraneuronal Aβ and cell viability assayed. IFNγ and TNFα strongly
potentiate both the accumulation of Aβ and cell death (Figure 4).
IL-8 was ineffective, likely because large amounts are secreted and
the cells are desensitized.
DISCUSSION
The above data show that Aβ accumulation in a human CNS nerve
cell line leads to the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and
chemokines, elevated eicosanoid synthesis and the activation of
inflammatory pathways. Prostaglandins tend to be neuroprotec-
tive and leukotrienes potentiate toxicity, whereas the activation of
cannabinoid receptors prevents Aβ accumulation and toxicity.
Both intracellular Aβ accumulation and nerve cell death are
potentiated by 5-LOX metabolites and proinflammatory cytokines.
Age and chronic systemic inflammation are risk factors for many
CNS diseases, including depression and Alzheimer’s,26 and the
elevation of peripheral inflammation in old individuals frequently
leads to cognitive decline.27 It follows that there is a complex
interrelationship between nerve cell proteotoxicity, inflammation,
aging and CNS disease.
Among CNS cytokines elevated in AD,28 all except IL6 are highly
expressed in MC65 cells following Aβ induction. However, while
there is an elevated inflammatory response within the AD brain, it
has generally been assumed to result from the activation of
microglia and astrocytes.29,30 Only in one report is a proinflam-
matory cytokine associated with nerve cells that contain Aβ.31
Here we outline the molecular basis of the proinflammatory
program caused by the accumulation of intracellular Aβ.
Epidemiological data show that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs delay the clinical features of AD,32 but clinical trials have
failed.33 Perhaps this is because the drugs were COX inhibitors
and, as shown here, the most toxic aspect of Aβ-induced
inflammation is mediated by 5-LOX metabolites, whereas the
COX metabolites PGE2 and PGD2 are neuroprotective. PGD2 is
100-fold more protective than PGE2. PGD2 is abundant in the
CNS,34 and the observation that COX-2 expression is high in AD
brain and in induced MC65 cells may be a reflection of the cells’
attempt at protection from Aβ toxicity.35
PGD2 activates the PD1 receptor, leading to an increase in
cAMP. The activation of PD1 receptors is generally thought to be
anti-inflammatory, and both PGD2 and the potent DP1 agonist,
BW245C, reduce nerve cell loss in ischemic stroke models and
excitotoxicity.36 PGE2 is also neuroprotective in several other
neurodegeneration models.37–39 PGE2 functions through the EP
receptors that are also coupled to cAMP production.
Of the multiple eicosanoids produced in the Aβ-initiated
responses in MC65 cells, the leukotriene metabolites of 5-LOX
are the only ones that potentiate toxicity. Curiously, only one
5-LOX inhibitor, Zileuton, has reached the clinic, and that is for
the treatment of lung inflammation. Zileuton also reduces AD
pathology in transgenic mice.40 Given the growing literature on
the role of AA metabolism in AD, 5-LOX inhibitors may be
therapeutically relevant. Excellent candidates are CNB-001 and
fisetin, that are over 10-fold more potent than Zileuton and are
very effective in AD transgenic mice.14,41
Caspase 1 is activated by Aβ in MC65 cells, and its activation can
be initiated via pattern recognition receptors or RAGE.42,43 RAGE is
highly expressed in neurons and is thought to be a receptor for
Aβ. The inflammatory response to intracellular Aβ, as well as
Caspase 1 activation and cell death, is reduced by the RAGE
inhibitor FPS-ZMI and by its knockdown. Because there is neither a
complete inhibition of cell death nor a complete reduction of
intracellular amyloid by either the RAGE inhibitor or RAGE
knockdown, it is unlikely to be the only pathway that contributes
to MC65 cell death.
Endocannabinoids can be produced in response to stress,44,45
and in rodent AD models cannabinoids reduce Aβ accumulation
and improve memory.46,47 THC also reduces inducible huntingtin
overexpression in PC12 cells,48 and both THC and endocannabi-
noids reduce inflammation.49,50 Several synthetic, plant derived
and endogenous cannabinoids are able to prevent the accumula-
tion of intraneuronal Aβ, reduce the production of eicosanoids,
and block nerve cell death. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude
that there is a therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for the
treatment of AD.
In summary,
the accumulation
of intraneuronal
Aβ
and
inflammation precede plaque formation and nerve cell death in
AD. It is shown here that intracellular Aβ activates a broad
spectrum of inflammatory signaling pathways. There is clearly a
dynamic interplay between these pathways that may lead to
either cell survival or death (Figure 5). Cell death can only be
completely prevented by 5-LOX inhibitors, cannabinoids and
caspase inhibitors. However, once the cell death process is
underway, death can be reduced by some prostaglandins.
Conversely, once initiated, cell death is potentiated by AA, LA,
some leukotrienes, CB1/2 inhibitors and cytokines that enhance
proinflammatory pathways. Despite these complexities, the data
strongly suggest that early intervention via the reduction of

Transfection of MC65 cells
MC65 cells were plated in 35-mm culture dishes and grown for 24 h.
Medium was exchanged by 1 ml of fresh growth medium without serum
and cells were transfected with 166 pmol of siRNA for hRAGE or a control
siRNA (pooled, Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX, USA) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX
reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After 24 h cells were plated for
experiments. The next day the cells were put into OptiMEM (Invitrogen)
with or without tet for the various experimental paradigms.
