Postmortem examination results of a patient with Guil-
lain-Barré syndrome and confirmed Zika virus infec-
tion revealed demyelination of the sciatic and cranial IV 
nerves, providing evidence of the acute demyelinating 
inflammatory polyneuropathy Guillain-Barré syndrome 
variant. Lack of evidence of Zika virus in nervous tissue 
suggests that pathophysiology was antibody mediated 
without neurotropism.
G
uillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an uncommon au-
toimmune disorder characterized by progressive, bi-
lateral weakness and diminished deep tendon reflexes due 
to peripheral nerve damage. GBS is typically triggered by 
an acute infection and, less frequently, by vaccination (1). 
GBS has been associated with infection by Zika virus, a 
flavivirus transmitted primarily by Aedes species mosqui-
toes (2), and countries have reported increased GBS inci-
dence during Zika virus outbreaks (3–5). Reports suggest 
Zika virus may result in a hyperacute immune response or 
have a direct viral neuropathic effect contributing to GBS 
(6). Further, case reports and series have noted higher rates 
of cranial neuropathy, such as facial palsy and paresthesia, 
among GBS patients with evidence of Zika virus infection, 
suggesting that the cranial nerves may be targeted by either 
virus or antibody (3,6–9).
Mortality rates among GBS patients in North America 
and Europe vary from 3% to 7% (1), and death often results 
from respiratory failure, autonomic dysfunction, or deep 
vein thrombosis (10). In Puerto Rico, the GBS in-hospital 
mortality rate before the introduction of Zika virus was es-
timated at 4% (11). Postmortem investigations of GBS are 
rare, but results may indicate underlying pathophysiologic 
mechanisms.
During a Zika virus epidemic in Puerto Rico in Feb-
ruary 2016, an islandwide surveillance system was imple-
mented to identify GBS cases and provide Zika virus di-
agnostic testing (9). Fatal GBS cases could be reported, 
and postmortem investigations were incorporated into an 
established fatal case surveillance system (12). Such inves-
tigations were implemented to clarify the pathophysiology 
of GBS patients with Zika virus infection.
The Study
In August 2016, a 78-year-old man living in the San Juan 
metropolitan area with a medical history of hypertension 
(for which he was taking amlodipine), diabetes, asthma, 
and prostate cancer visited a hospital emergency depart-
ment with a 4-day history of worsening paresthesia of 
the lower and upper extremities and progressive bilateral 
lower and upper extremity weakness (Figure 1). Com-
puted tomography without contrast of the head found no 
acute intracranial or other abnormalities. The patient was 
given albuterol nebulizer treatment, ipratropium bromide, 
and ceftriaxone and discharged home on the same day. 
Three days later, the patient returned to the emergency 
department with worsened weakness. He was admitted to 
the intensive care unit with respiratory distress and was 
intubated. Hospital staff suspected GBS due to mono-
phasic illness progression, symmetric weakness, and loss 
of deep tendon reflexes. A 5-day course of intravenous 
immunoglobulin (30 g/d) was initiated, and serum and 
urine specimens were collected for Zika virus diagnos-
tic testing. On day 7 after onset of neurologic illness, the 
patient had acute kidney injury and hyperuricemia. Elec-
trodiagnostic studies performed 10 days post-onset identi-
fied demyelinating polyneuropathy consistent with GBS 
(online Technical Appendix, https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/
EID/article/24/1/17-1331-Techapp1.pdf). Given clinical 
features and electrophysiologic findings, the patient met 
level 2 of the Brighton Collaboration Criteria for GBS di-
agnostic certainty (13).
The patient was mildly responsive by day 15 and 
thereafter became unresponsive but hemodynamically 
stable. On day 16, pneumonia was diagnosed, and a

course of vancomycin was started. Multidrug-resistant 
forms of Acinetobacter baumanii were found in sputum 
(collected on day 14) and fecal samples (collected on day 
18), and multidrug-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes and 
Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated from sputum (col-
lected on day 27). Computed tomography of the chest 
performed on day 20 indicated multifocal pneumonia 
with parapneumonic effusions involving the entire right 
lung and part of the left lung. Following an episode of 
cardiac arrest on day 23, tracheostomy for chronic respi-
ratory failure was performed on day 24. The patient died 
on day 37 due to cardiac arrest and respiratory failure 
complicated by bilateral pneumonia, sepsis, and acute 
renal failure.
An autopsy was performed, and external evalua-
tion noted edema of the left hand, scrotum, penis, legs, 
and feet, as well as decubitus ulcers on the back and 
in the gluteal area. Internal examination showed bilat-
eral pleural effusions, hepatic congestion, ascites, and 
cardiomegaly. Microscopic examination showed focal 
pneumonia, acute tubular necrosis, and prostate adenocar-
cinoma. Brain examination showed subacute watershed 
 
infarcts of the left cerebral hemisphere; occasional 
perivascular lymphomononuclear cell infiltrates were 
 
also observed.
We detected Zika virus RNA by reverse transcription 
PCR (RT-PCR) in urine and Zika virus and dengue virus 
IgM antibodies in serum (both collected on day 7). Ad-
ditional laboratory testing of premortem specimens was 
negative for Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, enteropathic 
isolates, Campylobacter jejuni, Legionella, Mycoplasma 
pneumoniae, HIV, influenza A and B, cytomegalovirus, 
and Epstein-Barr virus. We performed Zika virus RT-
PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays on forma-
lin-fixed paraffin-embedded autopsy tissue specimens. 
We detected neither RNA nor antigen for Zika virus in 
any autopsy specimens tested (Zika virus RT-PCR, cra-
nial nerve VII, sciatic nerve, and spinal cord including 
cauda equina; IHC, brain, spinal cord, sciatic nerve, and 
multiple solid organs).
We analyzed postmortem specimens of the periph-
eral and central nervous system and specimens from other 
organs by microscopic examination and special stains. 
A section of cranial nerve IV showed mononuclear lym-
phocytic infiltrate and mild myelin loss, while sections of 
the sciatic nerve showed inflammation-associated myelin 
loss. Myelin loss was highlighted by luxol fast blue stain-
ing (Figure 2). IHC staining for CD68 demonstrated an 
abundance of macrophages. Cranial nerves I, II, III, V, VI, 
and VII and spinal cord showed no substantial histopatho-
logic findings. Pathology findings in lung, prostate, and 
spleen tissues were consistent with comorbid conditions. 
Findings for heart, testicle, adrenal gland, gastrointestinal 
system, and thyroid specimens were unremarkable.
Conclusions
We report postmortem findings of a fatal GBS case (online 
Technical Appendix). Confirmation of Zika virus infec-
tion during acute neurologic illness and negative diagnostic 
test results for other potential GBS triggers (e.g., C. jejuni) 
provide strong evidence for Zika virus as the GBS trigger. 
Consistent with the patient’s electromyography results, his-
topathologic observation of demyelination of sciatic and 
cranial IV nerves provides phenotypic evidence of the acute 
demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy GBS variant. 
Although results from French Polynesia and Colombia found 
the acute motor axonal neuropathy variant (3,9), elsewhere, 
the acute demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy vari-
ant has predominated among GBS patients with evidence of 
Zika virus infection (14). Demyelination of both sciatic and 
cranial IV nerves is consistent with reported clinical signs of 
GBS patients with evidence of Zika virus infection. Despite 
reports of cranial neuropathy, including higher rates of facial 
palsy, ophthalmoplegia, and dysphagia, we observed no sub-
stantial pathologic findings in the patient’s cranial nerves I, 
II, III, V, VI, or VII. We found no evidence of direct infection

of the peripheral or central nervous tissue, suggesting ex-
pected antibody-mediated pathophysiologic mechanisms for 
GBS were triggered by Zika virus and not neurotropism.
Our report has several limitations. First, findings from 
a single patient might not be representative. Second, be-
cause antecedent illness was denied, timing of Zika virus 
infection could not be defined; however, time-to-loss of 
detection of Zika virus RNA in the urine of patients with 
symptomatic Zika virus infection is a median of 8 days 
(15). Last, neurotropism concomitant to antibody-mediated 
damage cannot be ruled out because viral antigen and RNA 
may have been cleared before autopsy or false-negative 
laboratory results could have occurred. Further, Zika virus 
RT-PCR results were only available for cranial nerve VII, 
3 sections of sciatic nerve, spinal cord, and cauda equina.
Despite these limitations, our findings provide crucial 
insights into GBS pathophysiology, specifically among 
GBS patients with evidence of Zika virus infection. Future 
investigations should collect postmortem specimens from 
GBS patients, particularly when death occurs soon after 
neurologic illness onset.
