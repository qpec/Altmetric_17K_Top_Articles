Measles causes a transient immune suppression, leading to increased susceptibility to
opportunistic infections. In experimentally infected non-human primates (NHPs) measles
virus (MV) infects and depletes pre-existing memory lymphocytes, causing immune amnesia.
A measles outbreak in the Dutch Orthodox Protestant community provided a unique
opportunity to study the pathogenesis of measles immune suppression in unvaccinated
children. In peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of prodromal measles patients, we
detected MV-infected memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and naive and memory B cells at
similar levels as those observed in NHPs. In paired PBMC collected before and after measles
we found reduced frequencies of circulating memory B cells and increased frequencies of
regulatory T cells and transitional B cells after measles. These data support our immune
amnesia hypothesis and offer an explanation for the previously observed long-term effects of
measles on host resistance. This study emphasises the importance of maintaining high
measles vaccination coverage.

easles virus (MV) is a highly infectious virus that is
transmitted through aerosols and droplets and causes
measles. Measles is characterised by fever, cough and
a maculopapular skin rash1. The disease is associated with a
transient immune suppression and increased risk of childhood
morbidity and mortality for a period of more than 2 years2,3,4.
Paradoxically, measles also induces strong cellular and humoral
immune responses that mediate lifelong protection5. Despite
the availability of safe and effective live-attenuated vaccines,
measles and its sequelae still cause more than 85,000 deaths
globally6. In Europe, a four-fold increase in the number of
measles cases was reported in 2017, largely due to declining
vaccination coverage7. The increase of vaccine hesitancy is a
major concern, since it appears to be linked to the lack of
understanding of the impact of measles as serious childhood
disease. To reach the goals set out in the Global Vaccine Action
Plan, which include elimination of measles by 2020 in five out
of six regions of the World Health Organisation (WHO)8,
improvement of public health information, education and
communication is crucial. A better understanding of the
pathogenesis of measles and measles-associated immune sup-
pression will help convey the message that vaccination is vital.
MV infects cells after binding to cellular receptors CD150 or
nectin-4, expressed on subsets of immune cells or the adherens
junctions of epithelial cells, respectively9–11. In experimentally
infected non-human primates (NHPs), MV initially targets
myeloid cells in the respiratory tract, which act as Trojan
horses by transmitting MV to CD150+ lymphocytes in lym-
phoid tissues, leading to viraemia and systemic virus dis-
semination12–15. Ensuing lymphocyte depletion and follicular
exhaustion in lymphoid tissues have been described during
prodromal measles in both humans and NHPs16,17. In vitro
and

studies
showed
that
memory
T
cells
are
more susceptible to MV infection than naive T cells, due to
higher expression of CD15017,18. This difference in suscept-
ibility

in

cell
lineage,
with
both naive and memory B cell subsets being highly susceptible
and permissive to MV infection in vitro17,19. Based on these
findings, we hypothesised that MV causes immunological
amnesia by infecting and depleting pre-existing memory
lymphocytes17,20. Consistent with this hypothesis, a sub-
sequent epidemiological study found that rates of non-measles
infectious disease mortality are tightly coupled to measles
incidence—with a greater mortality rate at higher recent
measles incidence. It was concluded that the reduction in host
resistance following measles infection may extend over a per-
iod of more than 2 years2.
In the Netherlands, a monovalent measles vaccine was
introduced into the national immunisation programme in
1976. Since 1987, measles vaccine has been offered as multi-
valent measles––mumps–rubella (MMR) vaccine to children at
the age of 14 months and 9 years. Since then, nationwide MMR
vaccination coverage has remained close to 95%21. However,
large measles outbreaks among unvaccinated individuals who
belong to socially and geographically clustered communities
still occur occasionally22,23. In 2013, a measles outbreak
occurred largely among the Orthodox Protestant community
that refuses vaccination on religious grounds, with more than
2600 cases reported23. This outbreak presented us with a
unique opportunity to study the pathogenesis of measles-
associated immune suppression in natural measles patients.
Here we show that MV viraemia is mediated by infected
memory T cells and naive and memory B cells. In addition, we
show that measles causes significant changes in the frequency
of circulating lymphocyte subsets, which are still detectable
more than a month after recovery.
Results
Characterisation of patients with early acute measles. We
performed an observational cohort study, and enrolled 26
unvaccinated children (ages ranged from 4 to 13 years old) with
clinical signs of prodromal measles into Cohort A. A complete set
of clinical specimens was successfully collected from 24 children,
of which 23 children experienced laboratory-confirmed measles
(Fig. 1a). Clinical signs as recorded by the parents included
classical measles symptoms like fever, conjunctivitis, coughing,
sneezing, throat pain and skin rash. More than half of the chil-
dren were also reported to have diarrhoea and/or vomiting
(Fig. 1b). Dizziness, ear pain, fatigue, nosebleed and mouth sores
were also reported, albeit less frequent. In 17 out of 23 patients,
specimens were collected during the prodromal stage of measles,
i.e. before the onset of rash (Fig. 1b). Total numbers of T and B
cells in peripheral blood were significantly decreased in the early
acute measles patients compared to those of age-matched healthy
controls, demonstrating measles-induced lymphopenia (Fig. 1c).
MV infection causes cell-associated viraemia, and the virus was
isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)
obtained from 22 out of 23 patients (Fig. 1d). In addition, the
virus was efficiently shed from the respiratory tract, as demon-
strated by virus isolation from throat swabs of 20 out of 23
patients (Fig. 1e) and nose swabs of 21 out of 23 patients (Fig. 1f).
Interestingly, virus titres detected in nose swabs were higher than
those detected in throat swabs (P = 0.021) (Fig. 2), and virus
shedding on average peaked between 2 days and 1 day before the
onset of rash (Fig. 1e, f). In accordance with the fact that the
samples were obtained during prodromal or early measles, the
majority still contained undetectable or low levels of MV-specific
IgM antibodies (Fig. 1g; Supplementary Fig. 1). From one of the
patients sampled 1 day after onset of rash, we failed to isolate MV
from either swabs or PBMC. In this patient, high MV-specific
IgM (Fig. 1g) were detected, confirming the laboratory diagnosis
(Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Data 1). This patient
had already developed a neutralising antibody response (Sup-
plementary Data 1, patient A01), explaining our inability to iso-
late virus from PBMC. Combined, these data provide an overview
of the clinical and virological characteristics of the early stages of
natural MV infection in unvaccinated children.
MV tropism during viraemia. To determine the phenotype of
MV-infected cells in the PBMC collected from early acute measles
patients in Cohort A, we performed surface staining of lympho-
cytes (Supplementary Table 1) and subsequent intracellular
staining with an antibody specific to the MV nucleoprotein (MV-
N), followed by flow cytometry. One PBMC sample from Cohort
A did not contain enough viable cells to allow phenotypic iden-
tification. Additionally, in this analysis we included PBMC sam-
ples collected from 18 children initially enrolled into the second
cohort of this study (Cohort B) that were later shown to be in the
incubation phase of measles. MV-infected cells were defined as
MV-N+ cells and expressed as a percentage out of their respective
lymphocyte subset (Supplementary Fig. 2). MV-infected cells
were hardly detected in the naive CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets
(Fig. 3a, c). In contrast, MV-infected cells were detectable in the
CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cell subsets (Fig. 3b, d), and in both
the naive and memory B cell subsets (Fig. 3e, f). The percentages
of MV-infected cells on average peaked 1 day before onset of rash.

 infected measles patients (Fig. 1c), with MV preferentially
infecting memory lymphocyte subsets (Fig. 3). To assess changes
in the composition of lymphocyte subsets before and after
measles, we enrolled 90 children without clinical signs into
Cohort B (Fig. 4a). The first PBMC samples (further termed as
pre-measles samples) were collected shortly before the start of the
Dutch primary school holidays, which lasted for 6 weeks. Blood
collection failed in three children and two other children turned
out to be vaccinated for measles and thus their samples were
excluded from the analyses. After the holidays, the second blood
samples, further termed as post-measles samples, were collected
from children who had experienced measles (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Paired blood samples were successfully collected from 82
children, aged between 6 and 13 years old during the time of

 sampling. Some children (n = 5) never developed measles during
the study period, as proven by the absence of MV-specific anti-
bodies in their second blood sample (Supplementary Fig. 1f). The
other 77 children experienced laboratory-confirmed measles
during the study period, since all pre-measles samples were
negative for MV-specific IgG and all post-measles samples con-
tained MV-specific IgM and IgG (Fig. 4b, c, Supplementary Fig. 1
and Supplementary Data 2). Median time between pre-measles
sample collection and parent-reported onset of rash was 16 days
(range 3–98). Parents assessed the severity of the disease: 34
children were reported with mild and 43 with severe measles
(Supplementary Data 2).
Impact of measles on immune cell subsets. After exclusion of
children who developed skin rash within 10 days after collection
of the pre-measles samples (n = 18; these samples were used
instead for phenotyping of MV-infected cells) or within 10 days
before collection of the post-measles samples (n = 4), and elim-
ination of samples that lacked viability (n = 13), 42 paired PBMC
samples were available for the assessment of phenotypes and
frequencies of lymphocyte subsets before and after measles. Total
IgM, IgA and IgG levels in the pre- and post-measles plasma
samples of these 42 donors were comparable (Supplementary
Fig. 4). We used three separate surface marker-staining sets
(Supplementary Table 1) and performed flow cytometry. As
analysis by unsupervised learning24 showed segregation into
clusters but did not allow identification of specific phenotypes
(Supplementary Fig. 5), we proceeded with classical gating
methods. Frequencies of specific T and B cell subsets were
determined after gating for viable single cells as described ear-
lier19. We expressed the changes in certain subsets as ratios of
lymphocyte subset frequencies after and before measles. No
changes were observed in the frequency of total circulating T cells
after measles. However, there was a significant decrease in the
frequency of CD4+ naive T cells, concomitant with an increase in
the frequency of CD4+ TCM cells. In the CD8+ T cell population,
a significant increase was observed among the TEMRO cells. In the
B cell population, there was a significant decrease in the fre-
quency of total circulating B cells, mainly due to the loss of
CD27− and CD27+ immunoglobulin class-switched memory B
cells after measles (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 6). Upon
examination of frequencies of functionally distinct T cell subsets
before and after measles, we found significant increases in the
frequencies of follicular helper T (TFH), helper T (TH)2, and
regulatory T (Treg) cell subsets after measles. Furthermore, in
accordance with the high susceptibility patterns to MV infection
observed in vitro, TH17 and TH1TH17 cell frequencies were sig-
nificantly decreased after natural measles19. We also assessed the
frequencies of functionally distinct B cell subsets before and after
measles and found significant losses of IgG+ and IgA+ memory B
cells, accompanied by a significant increase in the frequencies of
transitional B cells (Fig. 5b). Moreover, the changes in lympho-
cyte subset frequencies were overall more pronounced in children
with severe than those with mild measles (Supplementary Figs. 7
and 8).
Discussion
Measles is associated with immune suppression, leading to
increased susceptibility to secondary infections. Immune sup-
pression is not only the major driver of measles-associated
mortality in developing countries, but may also explain the pre-
viously reported association between measles and non-measles
infectious disease childhood mortality: an effect that extends over
2 years following the acute stage of the disease2. At the same time,
measles also causes immune activation and induces lifelong
immunity to measles. This apparent contrast is commonly
referred to as the measles paradox. Although several potential
underlying mechanisms have been described in literature, there is
no consensus about the relative importance of these hypotheses.
Based on observations from experimentally infected NHPs, we

 have recently proposed the immune amnesia model as a potential
explanation for the mechanism underlying the measles paradox.
In 2013, a large measles outbreak occurred among the Orthodox
Protestant community in the Netherlands and provided a unique
opportunity to study measles-associated immune suppression in
naturally infected measles patients. We performed a prospective
cohort study in unvaccinated children and successfully collected
clinical samples before, during and after measles. MV-infected
lymphocytes were detected in prodromal and early measles blood
samples, and infectious virus was recovered from nose swabs,
throat swabs and PBMC. We successfully identified the pheno-
types of infected peripheral lymphocytes during measles and
detected significant changes in lymphocyte composition after
measles.
In Cohort A, parents reported the onset and duration of clinical
symptoms, such as fever and skin rash. It should be emphasised
that the reports have been recorded based on subjective observa-
tions of the parents and thus must be interpreted with caution.
Interestingly, more children were reported with coughing than
sneezing, and coughing was reported to occur several days before
or on the day of the onset of rash in the majority of children.
Coughing, potentially caused by measles-associated damage to the
respiratory tract epithelium, likely contributes to the highly effi-
cient airborne transmission of MV, since it allows MV particles to
be expelled as infectious aerosols. During this time the highest
infectious viral loads were detected in nose swabs. This suggests
that MV replication in the nasopharynx rather than in the tra-
cheobronchial airways contributes to the high infectiousness of
measles11,25–27. Taking into consideration that the swab samples
were diluted in transport medium, the actual concentration of
infectious virus in the nasopharyngeal mucus must have been
substantially higher than the titres assessed by our assays.

 We were able to determine the phenotypes and frequencies of
MV-infected circulating lymphocytes during prodromal measles.
We found that, in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations,
memory cells were predominantly infected. In the B cell popu-
lation, both naive and memory cells were infected. These findings
are in agreement with previous in vitro observations and support
our immune amnesia hypothesis14,17,19. Although the preferential
infection of memory T cells by MV can be explained by the
higher expression of the cellular receptor CD150 on memory
T cells compared to naive T cells, this is not the case within the B
cell populations. The expression of CD150 is a prerequisite and
determines the susceptibility of lymphocytes to MV infection.
However, the permissiveness to replicate and produce infectious
progeny viruses likely depends on other intracellular factors, such
as activation state or cellular metabolism. In this case, we have
previously shown that B cells have higher permissiveness for MV
than T cells19.
A recent study investigating the phenotype of in situ MV-
infected cells in fatal measles cases identified macrophages and
dendritic cells as predominant infected cells28. This observation
fits well with pathological observations in experimentally infected
NHPs, in which MV-infected myeloid cells were detected both
early and late after measles. In contrast, MV-infected lympho-
cytes were detected at a high frequency both in peripheral blood
and in lymphoid tissues for only a short period14,17. We speculate
that MV infection of lymphocytes is more cytolytic than infection
of myeloid cells. In this study, we did not detect MV-infected
myeloid cells in peripheral blood. The only myeloid cell popu-
lation present in substantial numbers in peripheral blood are
monocytes, which do not express CD150 and are not susceptible
to MV infection14. Dendritic cells, which proved to be susceptible
to MV infection in NHPs and fatal measles cases14,28, are present
in peripheral blood in low numbers which does not allow
meaningful analysis of MV infection by flow cytometry. It is
important to note that, in NHPs, the frequencies of MV-infected
cells in lymphoid tissues were consistently higher than those
detected in peripheral blood14,17. The similarity of both the fre-
quencies and phenotypes of MV-infected cells in PBMC of nat-
ural measles patients to those previously observed in NHPs
justifies the translation of these observations from animal model
studies to natural measles in humans.
Analysis of the composition of T cell subsets before and after
measles showed a decreased frequency of CD4+ naive T cells and
increased frequencies of CD4+ TCM and CD8+ TEMRO. Other
memory T cell subsets showed both increased and decreased
frequencies, without a consistent pattern. This observation fits
well with our immune amnesia model, in which depletion of
infected memory T cells is masked by the expansion of newly
generated and phenotypically similar MV-specific and bystander
T cells17,20. Similar to observations in experimentally infected
NHPs, the balance between depletion and expansion may be
expected to vary among donors. Since the changes in T cell subset
frequency can be caused by antigen activation or homoeostatic
turnover2,17, further investigations of the fate of pre-existing
antigen-specific lymphocyte subsets after measles are required.
We further assessed the changes in the frequencies of func-
tionally distinct T cell subsets. Although γδ T cells have been
reported to expand in the presence of MV or MV-infected cells29,
we did not observe any significant changes in this subset in our
study. We observed a significant increase in the frequency of
circulating CXCR5+ TFH cells after measles. CXCR5 allows T cells
to localise to B cell follicles and germinal centres to support B cell
differentiation. However, since lymphocyte depletion and folli-
cular exhaustion have been reported in the lymph nodes of
experimentally infected NHPs, the increase of these circulating
TFH cells after measles is likely due to expansion of new migratory
populations. Circulating TFH and TH2 cells were the least sus-
ceptible among the functionally distinct T cell subsets to in vitro
MV infection19. This low susceptibility might have allowed the
cells to survive and expand during and following infection in vivo,
thus providing support to B cells to differentiate into antibody-
producing plasma cells. In contrast, circulating TH17 and

 TH1TH17 were the most susceptible subsets to in vitro MV
infection and accordingly their frequencies decreased significantly
after in vivo MV infection19. Treg cells are responsible for sup-
pression of T cell responses after immune activation and elevated
Treg cells have been observed in acute measles patients compared
to healthy controls30. We showed that Treg cells were indeed
increased in frequency after measles. However, whether this
population remains high for a prolonged time and contributes to
transient measles-induced immune suppression remains to be
determined.
We found that peripheral B cells, especially those belonging to
the class-switched memory subsets, were significantly reduced in
frequency after measles. This loss was more prominent in the IgG

to the higher susceptibility of IgG+ memory B cells to MV
infection19. Accompanying the loss of memory B cells after
measles was a significant influx of transitional B cells. Transi-
tional B cells represent recent bone marrow emigrants in the
circulation that will develop into mature naive B cells and have a
reduced proliferation capacity31. We speculate that the expansion

 of this subset reflects a compensation for depletion of pre-existing
memory B cells.
The mechanism underlying measles-induced immune sup-
pression has never been truly understood. Altered cytokine pro-
files, bystander lymphocyte apoptosis and lymphocyte infection
and depletion are a few of various proposed models to explain the
mechanism3,20. However, available studies have not provided
clear discrimination between the direct effect of MV infection on
the lymphocyte population and the host responses to infection
and lymphopenia after measles in vivo. In this study, we offer a
new perspective on host responses to natural measles. MV
infection causes lymphocyte depletion, with memory T and B
cells being the most severely affected. Observations from bone
marrow transplant recipients and HIV patients showed that
newly generated T cells had a short life span due to spontaneous
apoptosis, and these cells had a significantly decreased mitogenic
activity32–34. Highly proliferating PBMC and apoptotic unin-
fected lymphocytes have been isolated from the blood of acute
measles patients and reduced responsiveness to mitogen stimu-
lation has been reported, suggesting that similar cells are present
after measles35,36. B- and T cell receptor sequencing studies are
required to determine whether the new emerging lymphocytes
have similar antigen specificity to the lost ones.
Our study has a number of limitations. We observed a sub-
stantial level of biological variation in the changes in lymphocytes
subset frequencies, with increases in some subjects while
decreases were seen in others. We believe that our study con-
tained a sufficient sample size to allow statistical analysis of the
results and, despite individual variation, interpret changes as
mediated by measles. Our study was limited to three time points
(before, during and after measles). Although additional follow-up
samples could have provided more insight in the longevity of
measles-associated
immune
suppression,
this
would
have
increased the risk of non-compliance resulting in a loss of sta-
tistical power. Observational studies in healthy children are dif-
ficult, especially in terms of obtaining medical ethical clearance
and informed consent and assent. Moreover, at the moment of
preparation of our clinical study protocol, data suggesting that
measles-associated immune suppression might continue for more
than 2 years were not yet available. Thus, we did not see any
reasons to justify additional sampling points. Another study
limitation is the absence of baseline haematological and bio-
chemical data for each sampling. This would have required col-
lection of additional blood tubes, which we believe would have
reduced the willingness of parents and children to participate in
our study.
In conclusion, our study shows that measles viraemia in pro-
dromal measles patients is mediated by MV-infected memory
T cells and naive and memory B cells. We also show that measles
has an impact on circulating lymphocyte subsets that lasts more
than a month after recovery from the disease. These results offer
an explanation for the observed long-term effects of measles on
host resistance and underline the importance of maintaining
measles vaccination coverage.
Methods
Ethical statement. Unvaccinated children aged 4 to 17 years old at the moment of
sampling, without a history of natural measles, were recruited by distributing
invitation letters and patient information forms via three Orthodox Protestant
schools with low vaccination coverage (<20%) in the Netherlands. Children with
chronic disease or immune suppression due to medication were excluded from
participation. Despite the availability of free vaccination in the Dutch public
healthcare system, the parents of our study participants refused all vaccinations on
basis of religious grounds. They continued to do so in the face of an ongoing
measles outbreak. No additional measures or interventions were available to pre-
vent MV infections. Some patients developed complications, such as otitis media or
pneumonia, and visited their general practitioners for treatment. However, none of
the study participants required hospitalisation due to severe measles. An
investigator and a research nurse visited the responding parents at home to provide
them with additional explanation of the study. Clinical specimens were collected
after verbal assent was obtained from participants younger than 12 years old or
written informed consent from participants aged 12 years and older. Written
informed consent from both parents was always obtained. The study protocol was
approved by the medical ethical committee of Erasmus MC, the Netherlands
(MEC-2013-302, CCMO register NL45323.078.13/2, see [http://www.
toetsingonline.nl] and Supplementary Data 3).
Clinical specimens. Children aged 4 to 13 years old (n = 26) in the prodromal
phase or early stage of acute measles were enrolled into Cohort A. Complete
sample sets were successfully collected from 24 children, of which 23 had
laboratory-confirmed measles. Each sample set included throat and nose swabs
(regular flocked swabs; COPAN Diagnostics Inc., USA) collected into 2.5 ml of
virus transport medium and a single venous blood sample collected in a 10-ml
heparin vacutainer tube26. Swab samples were homogenised using a vortex for 1
min, and viral transport medium aliquots were frozen at −80 °C. Cohort B
included 90 children without clinical signs of measles, from whom 82 complete
sample sets were successfully collected. Each sample set included paired blood
samples collected in a 10-ml heparin vacutainer tube. A research nurse recorded
parent-reported clinical signs and degrees of disease severity following telephone
interviews. After laboratory tests, 77 children were confirmed to have measles
between collection of the paired samples.
Blood sample processing. In Cohort A, absolute counts of CD3+ T cells, CD19+
B cells and CD16+/CD56+ natural killer cells in whole-blood samples (50 µl) were
determined by flow cytometry using Trucount tubes (BD Biosciences, USA)37.
Identical data collected from age-matched healthy donors (n = 23)38,39 were
included as controls. PBMC were isolated from heparinised blood samples of both
cohorts. The tubes were centrifuged at 1200 g for 15 min followed by collection of
plasma. Plasma was heat-inactivated for 30 min at 56 °C, and subsequently aliquots
were frozen at −20 °C. Following centrifugation, cell pellets were reconstituted with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and subjected to density gradient centrifugation.
PBMC were washed and frozen in RPMI-1640 medium (Lonza, Belgium) sup-
plemented with 20% of foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide at
−135 °C.
Cell culture and virus isolation. Vero cells expressing human CD150 (Vero-
hCD150) were a kind gift from Prof Yusuke Yanagi, Kyushu University, Japan. The
cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Lonza) supplemented
with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin and L-glutamine (D10F medium)40. A
human B-lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL) was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, penicillin, streptomycin and L-glutamine (R10F
medium)41. The cell line was generated in-house by Epstein-Barr virus-transfor-
mation of PBMC of a healthy adult donor. Human melanoma Mel-JuSo cells
transfected with the full-length MV-Edmonston fusion (F) or hemagglutinin (H)
genes (Mel-JuSo-F or Mel-JuSo-H)42 were grown in R10F medium. Virus isolations
were performed by inoculation of Vero-hCD150 cells or BLCL with PBMC or virus
transport medium from swab samples in two-fold serial dilutions (eight replicates
per dilution). Viral cytopathic effects were monitored over a period of 3–7 days and
a virus titre was calculated by determining the 50% endpoint using the formula of
Reed and Muench43. One of the virus isolates (MVi/Dodewaard.NLD/29.13; gen-
otype D8) was used for full genome sequencing as described previously (GenBank
accession number: MG912592)44. This isolate is available via the European Virus
Archive [https://www.european-virus-archive.com].
MV-specific antibody detection. MV-specific IgM was detected using the Measles
IgM capture EIA kit (Microimmune, UK). Results are expressed as a ratio of the
optical density of the test sample over that of a reference sample (cut-off for
positivity is 1.1). MV-specific IgG was detected using an in-house indirect MV IgG
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay45. Briefly, high-binding 96-well flat-
bottomed plates were coated with beta-propiolactone-inactivated MV antigen
(strain Edmonston) in PBS, and incubated with plasma diluted 1:300 in buffer
containing PBS, 0.05% Tween-20, 5% milk and 1% rabbit serum. Specific anti-
bodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labelled rabbit-anti-human IgG
antibody (1:4,800; DAKO, Denmark, cat. no. P0214) and tetramethylbenzidine as a
substrate. Results are shown as extinction at 450 nm with a reference filter of 620
nm. Each sample was measured in duplicate. MV F and H protein-specific IgM and
IgG antibody levels were detected by flow cytometry42. Briefly, trypsinised cells
were incubated with plasma samples diluted 1:100 in PBS supplemented with 3%
FBS, and bound antibodies were detected using a FITC-labelled polyclonal rabbit-
anti-human IgG conjugate (1:50; DAKO, cat. no. F0315). Fluorescence was mea-
sured on a BD FACS Canto II flow cytometer, and results are shown as geometric
mean fluorescence expressed in arbitrary fluorescence units (AFU). Virus neu-
tralising antibodies were detected using a fluorescent focus reduction neutralisation
assay45. Briefly, Vero-hCD150 cells were seeded in a 96-well flat-bottomed plate in
R10F medium 4 days prior to the experiment. Serial dilutions (22–29, each dilution
was tested in duplicate) of the heat-inactivated plasma samples were prepared with
recombinant MV strain Edmonston expressing EGFP (1:1) and incubated for 1.5 h

 at 37 °C. The plasma-virus mixture was then transferred to the 96-well plate
containing Vero-hCD150 cells. After incubation for 4 h at 37 °C, fusion inhibitory
protein (Bachem, Heidelberg, Germany) was added to each well to a final con-
centration of 0.2 mM to prevent cell-to-cell fusion. The cells were incubated at 37 °
C for another 2 days, after which they were washed with PBS and fixed with 2%
paraformaldehyde in PBS. Single fluorescent cells were counted automatically using
an ImmunoSpot S6 analyser (CTL, Bonn, Germany) and the 50% focus reduction
titre was determined. Results were expressed in international units per ml using the
WHO third international reference serum for measles (NIBSC, South Mimms,
United Kingdom).
Flow cytometry. Frequencies of infected cells and lymphocyte subsets in PBMC
were determined by flow cytometry using a Fortessa Cell Analyser (BD Bios-
ciences). PBMC were thawed on the day of measurement and washed twice with
Iscove’s Modified Dulbecco’s Medium (IMDM; Lonza) supplemented with 10%
FBS (I10F medium). The cells were incubated in I10F medium supplemented with
50 U/ml benzonase (Merck Millipore, USA) for 30 min prior to centrifugation and
suspension in PBS with antibodies for flow cytometry. In Cohort A, an multicolour
staining was performed to identify MV-infected lymphocyte subsets (see Supple-
mentary Table 1)19. Viable cells were identified using LIVE/DEAD Fixable Dead
Cell Stain kit with Aqua fluorescent reactive dye (Life Technologies, USA). The
presence of MV MV-N in the cells was detected by intracellular staining with an
MV-N-specific monoclonal antibody conjugated with FITC (clone 83KKII; Merck
Millipore), using a fixation and permeabilisation kit according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions (BD Biosciences)19. Antibody dilutions and catalogue
numbers used in this study are available in Supplementary Table 1. MV infection
levels within each lymphocyte subset were assessed by detection of cells expressing
MV-N and shown as percentages. In Cohort B, three separate multicolour stainings
were performed to identify T and B cell subsets, as specified before (Supplementary
Table 1)19,37,46. Viable cells were identified using Fixable Viability Stain 520 (BD
Biosciences). All gating strategies used for analyses in this study are shown in
Supplementary Figs. 9–12.
Statistical analyses. The statistical differences in the absolute number of T and B
cells in the blood of acute measles patients in comparison to age-matched healthy
donors and the statistical differences in virus titres of throat and nose swabs were
analysed by Mann–Whitney rank sum test. The ratio of lymphocyte subset fre-
quency before and after measles was calculated as the frequency of the subset after
measles divided by the frequency of the same subset before measles. Ratio ‘1’
indicates no changes, while ratio ‘>1’ indicates increase and ratio ‘<1’ indicates
decrease in lymphocyte subset frequency after measles. Statistical differences in
frequencies of lymphocyte subsets before and after measles were analysed by two-
tailed paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P ≤ 0.001.
Each measurement in this study was performed once, unless mentioned otherwise.
