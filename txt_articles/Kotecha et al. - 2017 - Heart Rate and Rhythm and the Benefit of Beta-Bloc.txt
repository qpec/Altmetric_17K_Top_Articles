Abstract  
Background:  The relationship between mortality and heart rate remains unclear for patients 
with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) in either sinus rhythm or atrial 
fibrillation (AF).   
Objective:  To investigate the prognostic importance of heart rate in HFrEF in randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta-blockers and placebo. 
Methods:  The Beta-blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group performed a meta-analysis of 
harmonized individual-patient data from eleven double-blind RCTs.  The primary outcome was 
all-cause mortality, analysed with Cox proportional hazard ratios (HR) modelling heart rate 
measured at baseline and approximately six-months post-randomization. 
Results:  A higher heart rate at baseline was associated with greater all-cause mortality in 
patients with sinus rhythm (n=14,166; adjusted HR 1.11 per 10 beats/minute; 95% CI 1.07-1.15, 
p<0.0001), but not in AF (n=3,034; HR 1.03 per 10 beats/minute; 0.97-1.08, p=0.38).  Beta-
blockers reduced ventricular rate by 12 beats/minute in both sinus rhythm and AF.  Mortality 
was lower for patients in sinus rhythm randomised to beta-blockers (HR 0.73 versus placebo, 
95% CI 0.67-0.79; p<0.001), regardless of baseline heart rate (interaction p=0.35).  Beta-
blockers had no effect on mortality in patients with AF (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81-1.12; p=0.58) at 
any heart rate (interaction p=0.48).  A lower achieved resting heart rate, irrespective of treatment, 
was associated with better prognosis only for patients in sinus rhythm (HR 1.16 per 10 
beats/minute increase, 95% CI 1.11-1.22; p<0.0001). 
Conclusions:  Regardless of pre-treatment heart rate, beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients 
with HFrEF in sinus rhythm.  Achieving a lower heart rate is associated with better prognosis, 
but only for those in sinus rhythm.

Condensed Abstract (100 words) 
Meta-analysis of individual-patient data from eleven double-blind randomized trials found that 
higher baseline heart rate was associated with greater all-cause mortality for those in sinus 
rhythm, but not for those in AF. Mortality was lower for patients in sinus rhythm assigned beta-
blockers (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.67-0.79; p<0.001), regardless of baseline heart rate. Beta-blockers 
had no effect on mortality in patients with AF (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81-1.12; p=0.58) at any heart 
rate. A lower achieved resting heart rate was associated with better prognosis only for patients in 
sinus rhythm (HR 1.16 per 10 beats/minute increase, 95% CI 1.11-1.22; p<0.0001).

Introduction 
Beta-blockers reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with heart failure and reduced 
left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) in sinus rhythm (1,2). It is not clear whether the key 
mechanism underpinning their benefits is protection of adrenergic receptors from heightened 
sympathetic activity or reduction in heart rate.  It is also uncertain whether the efficacy of beta-
blockers is related to dose, reduction in heart rate or achieved heart rate.(3-10)  These questions 
are conceptually important for how clinicians manage and follow-up patients with HFrEF.  
Furthermore, there may be a clinically important interaction with heart rhythm.(11)  Although 
beta-blockers reduce the incidence of new-onset atrial fibrillation (AF) in HFrEF(1,12), they do 
not appear to reduce mortality for patients with established HFrEF and concomitant AF.(1) 
The Beta-blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group pooled individual patient-data 
(IPD) from major randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing beta-blockers to placebo in 
patients with heart failure in order to investigate further their efficacy and safety.(13)  With 
almost all the available IPD, this analysis permits a robust assessment of the associations 
between heart rate, heart rhythm and mortality.  Our aims were to answer three questions for 
patients with HFrEF according to their heart rhythm: 1) does baseline heart rate predict 
mortality?; 2) does the effect of beta-blockers on mortality differ according to baseline heart 
rate?; and 3) what is the association between achieved heart rate, achieved dose and mortality? 
Methods 
The Beta-blockers in Heart Failure Collaborative Group (BB-meta-HF) includes leading 
investigators from relevant landmark trials, with the support of the pharmaceutical companies 
that conducted them (AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck Serono and Menarini).  This report 
was prepared according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) IPD guidance(14) and prospectively registered with Clinicaltrials.gov

(NCT0083244) and the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (CRD42014010012).(15)  
Detailed rationale and methods have previously been published (1,2,13). Each trial required 
appropriate ethical approval. 
Eligibility & search strategy 
A systematic search was performed of Medline and Current Contents, scrutiny of 
reference lists of trials, trials registries, meeting abstracts, review articles as well as discussion 
with group members and pharmaceutical manufacturers (1,2,13). We included RCTs that 
reported mortality as a primary or part of a composite outcome comparing beta-blockers versus 
placebo with recruitment of >300 patients and planned follow-up of >6 months.  Eleven studies 
were included that account for 95.7% of eligible participants recruited in RCTs based on a 
systematic literature review: the Australia/New Zealand Heart Failure Study (ANZ)(16), the 
Beta-Blocker Evaluation Survival Trial (BEST)(17), the Carvedilol Post-Infarct Survival Control 
in LV Dysfunction Study (CAPRICORN)(18), the Carvedilol Hibernating Reversible Ischaemia 
Trial: Marker of Success Study (CHRISTMAS)(19), the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study 
(CIBIS I)(20), the Cardiac Insufficiency Bisoprolol Study II (CIBIS-II)(21), the Carvedilol 
Prospective Randomized Cumulative Survival Study (COPERNICUS)(22), the Metoprolol in 
Idiopathic Dilated Cardiomyopathy Study (MDC)(23), the Metoprolol CR/XL Randomised 
Intervention Trial in Congestive Heart Failure (MERIT-HF)(24), the Study of the Effects of 
Nebivolol Intervention on Outcomes and Rehospitalisation in Seniors with Heart Failure 
(SENIORS) (25) and the U.S. Carvedilol Heart Failure Study (US-HF).(26)  All included studies 
had low risk of bias (27).

Data were extracted from original source files provided by the pharmaceutical companies 
and lead investigators.(13)  All trials provided IPD and databases were harmonized according to 
a standardized data request form to match patient characteristics and outcomes across all trials.  
Discrepancies, inconsistencies and incomplete data were checked against original case report 
forms, trial documentation and published reports to ensure IPD integrity.  The clinically-derived 
resting heart rate was used in analysis, as this was consistently recorded in all trials at each major 
study visit.  Due to the small amount of missing data, imputation was not performed. 
Participants 
We included all patients with a baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) that showed either 
sinus rhythm or AF/atrial flutter.  For the purposes of this report, reference to AF therefore 
includes atrial flutter.(1)  Patients with a missing baseline ECG or a paced rhythm were 
excluded.  We also excluded all patients with documented heart block, as 2nd/3rd degree heart 
block was an exclusion criterion in some of the trials. 
Outcomes & effect measures 
The outcome for this analysis was all-cause mortality, including additional deaths on 
follow-up available from seven studies (19-21, 25, 26, 28, 29). Our analysis used heart rate as a 
continuous variable and also categorized into pre-specified clinical groups (<70, 70-90 and >90 
beats/minute).  All trials excluded patients with lower heart rates, as defined in Figure 1. 
Statistical analysis 
A statistical analysis plan was generated and finalized by the Collaborative Group in 
advance of data analysis. Summary results are presented as percentages, or median and 
interquartile range (IQR; displayed as 25th to 75th quartiles).  Estimated glomerular filtration rate

(GFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula, 
normalized to a body surface area of 1.73 m2. 
All analyses followed the principle of intention to treat.  Baseline heart rhythm groups 
(sinus rhythm or AF) were analysed separately.  Outcomes were analysed using a Cox 
proportional hazards regression model(28), stratified by study.  This is a one-stage fixed effects 
approach and assumes that all trials are estimating a common treatment effect with baseline 
hazards that vary across studies.  The independent variable was continuously-distributed heart 
rate.  We assessed the relationship between continuous heart rate and mortality using fractional 
polynomials to find the best transformation(29), however a linear association was the best fit 
(with note taken of the scarce data below a heart rate of 60 beats/minute due to trial exclusion 
criteria).  Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are presented, along with 
corresponding p-values.  We pre-specified adjustment in Cox models for age, gender, left-
ventricular ejection fraction, systolic blood pressure, prior myocardial infarction, and baseline 
use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretic 
therapy.  Treatment allocation and heart rate were also adjusted for, where appropriate.  The 
goodness-of-fit C-statistic for the main stratified Cox model was 0.66 for sinus rhythm and 0.64 
for AF at 20 months.  Kaplan-Meier plots were used to graph the pooled trial data.  Few patients 
were followed for more than three years and therefore data were censored at 1200 days (3.3 
years) from randomization.  Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-squared test and I2 
statistic, with the estimate of heterogeneity taken from the inverse-variance fixed-effects two-
stage model.(30)  Predefined sensitivity analyses were alternative censor points (1 year and 2 
year), alternative methodology (two-stage meta-analysis and fixed versus random effects(31)) 
and restriction to a heart rate between 60 and 140 beats/minute at baseline.

Analyses at the interim study time-point (mean of 184 days from randomization) 
excluded those who had died, withdrawn consent or were lost to follow-up.  Not all patients 
attended an interim visit or had a heart rate recorded at this time; however, the number of 
patients without interim data was similar across treatment groups for both sinus rhythm and AF.  
Furthermore, there was no significant difference in baseline heart rate compared to those with 
interim data, or any difference in the observed hazards for either heart rate or beta-blocker 
efficacy.  We performed two post-hoc analyses not detailed in our pre-specified analysis plan: (i) 
assessment of mortality in patients on beta-blockers who attained a heart rate <60 beats/minute; 
and (ii) assessment of mortality according to beta-blocker dose achieved at the interim visit.  
There were missing data on dosage in all studies, and two studies provided no 
information.(17,19)  For consistency across the different beta-blockers and trials, dose achieved 
was expressed as the percentage of maximum target dose according to the particular beta-blocker 
and specific trial design.  
There was no evidence of violation of the proportional hazards assumption in any 
multivariate model as determined by Schoenfeld residuals.(32)  Effect modification was assessed 
using p-values from interaction terms fitted in the multivariate models.(29,33)  A two-tailed p-
value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Analyses were performed on Stata Version 
14.1 (StataCorp LP, Texas) and R Version 3.2.1 (R Core Team, Vienna). 
Results 
Individual patient-data were obtained for 18,637 patients.  Patients were excluded due to 
a missing baseline electrocardiogram (n=118), heart block (n=510) or paced rhythm (n=616).  A 
further 15 participants had missing baseline heart rate.  The final cohort included 14,313 patients

in sinus rhythm and 3,065 in AF (Figure 1). Three patients (one in sinus rhythm and two in AF) 
had missing event dates and were excluded from outcome analyses. 
Median age was 65 years (IQR 55-72), 24% were women, and median left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline was 0.27 (IQR 0.21-0.33).  Median baseline heart rate was 
80 beats/minute for those in sinus rhythm (IQR 72-88) and 81 beats/minute for those in AF (IQR 
72-92).  Characteristics according to baseline heart rhythm are presented in Table 1.  Regardless 
of heart rhythm, patients with higher heart rate were younger and more likely to be women, have 
non-ischemic cardiomyopathy and have lower LVEF and more severe symptoms.  There were no 
differences in patient characteristics according to randomized treatment for either sinus rhythm 
(Online Table 1) or AF (Online Table 2) in any heart rate group. 
Heart rate at baseline and mortality for patients in sinus rhythm or AF 
For patients in sinus rhythm, there were 2,141 deaths in 14,166 patients (15.1%) over a 
mean follow-up of 1.5 years (SD 1.1).  Baseline heart rate was associated with all-cause 
mortality, with a HR of 1.11 per 10 beats/minute (95% CI 1.07-1.15, p<0.0001), adjusted for 
baseline variables and treatment allocation.  From the Kaplan Meier analysis (Figure 2-A), 
higher baseline heart rates were associated with higher mortality in patients assigned to either 
placebo or beta-blockers. 
For patients in AF at baseline, there were 609 deaths in 3,034 patients (20.1%), but there 
was no association between baseline heart rate and mortality (adjusted HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97-
1.08, p=0.38; Figure 2-B). 
The Central Illustration displays the modelling of heart rate as a continuous variable 
and the hazard ratio of death, according to baseline heart rhythm.  Contrary to results in sinus 
rhythm, there was no relationship between baseline heart rate and mortality for those in AF

(p=0.003 for interaction).  Sensitivity analyses showed similar results to the main findings 
(Online Table 3). 
Efficacy of beta-blockers according to baseline heart rate 
Beta-blockers reduced heart rate by 11 to 12 beats/minute in both sinus rhythm and AF 
(Online Table 4 and Figure 1). The overall HR for mortality comparing beta-blockers with 
placebo for patients in sinus rhythm was 0.73 (95% CI 0.67-0.79; p<0.0001) with similar benefit 
for all three strata of baseline heart rate (Table 2 and Figure 3).  There was no interaction with 
baseline heart rate as a continuous variable (p=0.35).In contrast, beta-blockers did not reduce 
mortality for patients in AF, either overall (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.81-1.12; p=0.58) or for any 
baseline heart rate stratum (interaction p=0.48; Table 2).  Similar results were seen in sensitivity 
analyses (Online Table 3). 
Achieved versus change in post-randomization heart rate and mortality 
A landmark analysis was performed, starting at an interim visit after expected dose-
titration for each surviving participant (mean of 184 ± 144 days from randomization)with a 
recorded interim heart rate (n=12,441 in sinus rhythm and n=2,566 in AF).  Mean heart rate was 
similar at the interim and final visits for surviving patients in sinus rhythm or AF, suggesting 
stable beta-blockade had been reached (Online Figure 1). 
For patients in sinus rhythm, the heart rate achieved at the interim visit was more strongly 
associated with mortality than the change in heart rate from baseline (HR per 10 beats/minute 
1.16, 95% CI 1.11-1.22; Online Table 5).  The lowest mortality in sinus rhythm was observed in 
patients who attained lower heart rates after beta-blocker therapy (Figure 4-A). Conversely, in 
patients with AF, neither attained nor change in heart rate were associated with survival (Figure 
4-B and Online Table 5).

Analysis of post-randomization beta-blocker dosage in sinus rhythm 
Separately-fitted models in patients with sinus rhythm for those assigned to placebo or 
beta-blockers showed consistent findings for the association of interim heart rate and mortality.  
In patients randomized to beta-blockers (n=6,327), the adjusted HR was 1.12 per 10 beats/minute 
(95% CI 1.05-1.19).  In patients randomized to placebo, where dose does not affect heart rate 
(n=6,114), the adjusted HR was 1.13 per 10 beats/minute (95% CI 1.08-1.19). 
Analysis of dose achieved (Online Table 6) was complicated by susceptibility to bias 
due to non-random missing data.  Achieving a higher dose was associated with lower mortality 
in both the placebo and beta-blocker arms (Online Figure 2). 
Discussion 
Our analysis confirms a reduction in mortality with beta-blockers for patients with HFrEF 
in sinus rhythm, irrespective of pre-treatment heart rate within the studied range.  Resting heart 
rate is an important prognostic indicator, both before and after initiation of beta-blockers; a lower 
achieved heart rate is associated with lower subsequent mortality and is more likely to occur in 
patients initiated on a beta-blocker.  In patients with concomitant AF, heart rate was not 
associated with mortality and beta-blockers did not reduce mortality at any observed heart rate. 
Insights on the mechanism of action of beta-blockers  
Whether reduction in morbidity and mortality in patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm is 
related to myocardial protection from heightened sympathetic activity or due to reductions in 
heart rate is uncertain.  Chronic adrenergic over-stimulation is thought to provoke myocyte 
dysfunction and arrhythmias(34), providing a theoretical rationale for prescribing beta-blockers 
for HFrEF.  However, a large trial of moxonidine, which inhibits sympathetic activation, was 
stopped prematurely for harm, which casts doubt on this hypothesis.(35)  Heart rate reduction

may also improve cardiac myocyte metabolism by conserving energy, improving calcium 
recycling, increasing diastolic blood flow and protecting against ischemia. Our finding that beta-
blockers reduce mortality regardless of pre-treatment heart rate within the studied range, 
suggests that the mechanism of action of beta-blockers is not simply due to lowering heart rate.  
Moreover, ivabradine, which decreases heart rate by If-channel blockade rather than by 
sympathetic inhibition, did not reduce mortality overall when added to beta-blockers, although it 
did reduce the composite of cardiovascular death or hospital admission for worsening heart 
failure (36). 
Divergent responses in patients with atrial fibrillation 
Numerous observational studies suggest a relationship between resting heart rate and 
prognosis in patients with AF(37) and those with HFrEF in sinus rhythm (5,38). However, 
ventricular rate appears to be a poor predictor of outcomes for patients with concomitant HFrEF 
and AF.  Lower ventricular rates in AF may even be associated with adverse prognosis(39), but 
why the relationship between heart rate and prognosis should differ by heart rhythm is uncertain.  
Perhaps, heart rate is a good reflection of sympathetic activation only for patients in sinus 
rhythm.  A major determinant of heart rate is also vagal activity, which may be increased by 
beta-blockade and potentially more important for patients in sinus rhythm compared to AF.(40)  
Alternatively, the relationship could be confounded by an increase in risk associated with 
variable R-R intervals in AF or ventricular pauses.(41)  The Rate Control Efficacy in Permanent 
Atrial Fibrillation (RACE-II) study, an RCT of strict compared to lenient heart rate control of 
AF, failed to show a difference in outcome between these strategies, even amongst those patients 
with concomitant heart failure (42).

We previously identified a highly significant interaction between the effects of beta-
blockers on mortality and heart rhythm (p=0.002) (1), but why beta-blockers do not reduce 
mortality in HFrEF patients with AF remains unclear.(43,44)  If their benefits are mediated by 
blocking adrenergic-receptors on cardiac myocytes, then heart rhythm should be irrelevant.  
Similarly, if their benefits are mediated by reducing ventricular rate then these should also be 
similar regardless of heart rhythm.  Further work is clearly warranted to identify patterns of 
autonomic function and the effects of autonomic modulation in patients with heart failure and 
AF.  
Target heart rate versus target dose 
Whether clinicians should strive to achieve a target heart rate or a target does of beta-
blocker remains unanswered and the authors of this paper were unable to reach a consensus.  In 
this analysis, beta-blockers reduced mortality regardless of baseline heart rates for patients with 
HFrEF in sinus rhythm.  All trial protocols, which form the basis for current international 
guidelines, requested titration to a target dose of beta-blocker, provided they were tolerated and 
did not cause excessive bradycardia.  A dose-dependent improvement in LVEF and survival was 
observed in the Multicenter Oral Carvedilol Heart Failure Assessment (MOCHA) trial(45), 
although this trial only included 345 patients. No large trial has randomized patients to higher 
versus lower doses, although post-hoc analyses suggest greater benefit from higher 
doses.(3,9,46)  A trial-level meta-analysis of seven dose-ranging studies of beta-blockers 
provided inconclusive evidence of a dose relationship with mortality (47); further prospective 
trials are required to clarify this issue. 
Conversely, for those that believe that lowering heart rate is the key mediator of beta-
blocker benefit for patients with HFrEF in sinus rhythm, our analysis supports the notion that

achieving a lower rate (~60 beats/minute) is beneficial, perhaps because it is a physiological 
marker indicating that adequate beta-receptor blockade has been achieved. The advantage of an 
approach that titrates to a target heart rate is clinical simplicity that, serendipitously, may lead to 
increased use of the guideline-recommended target doses of beta-blockers, as well as being a 
measure of patient adherence to therapy. 
Ultimately, heart rate and prescribed beta-blocker dose are intimately related; one is a 
surrogate for the other although the relationship may be complicated by other factors such as 
genetic variations in beta-blocker response and drug metabolism.  Our observation of dose-
related differences in mortality in patients assigned to placebo clearly demonstrates that it is 
unsafe to make strong inference from any analysis of a post-randomization variable such as dose.  
Dose achieved is itself an outcome(48), affected by confounding patient factors, adherence, 
physician preferences and bias, including the perceived risk of adverse outcomes. 
Limitations 
This was a retrospective analysis and background therapy, including devices, will have 
changed since these trials were conducted.  Heart rate was not measured in a standardized 
fashion across trials, and may have been less accurate in patients with AF.  Although by using 
IPD we were able to adjust for many known confounders with sufficient power for statistical 
analysis, unmeasured variables may have affected heart rate or dose of beta-blocker.  The trials 
had different patient populations and used different beta-blockers; we have previously 
demonstrated that excluding individual trials had no impact on results(1), and the diversity of 
trial participants could be considered a strength.  Our analysis plan specified that only mortality 
would be analysed as an outcome.  Although data on hospitalization were available, this outcome 
may be biased as heart rate can influence the likelihood of a physician admitting a patient.  The

power to explore effects in the subgroup with AF is limited by its modest size (albeit large in 
comparison to many other reports) and includes a small number of patients with atrial flutter.  
Few patients with a resting heart rate <65 beats/minute were enrolled in these RCTs, and hence 
we are unable to comment on patients with slower heart rates prior to receiving a beta-blocker.  
There is uncertainty at where the nadir of risk in the relationship between heart rate and risk lies, 
but there will be a rate below which mortality rises. 
Conclusions 
Beta-blockers reduce mortality at all studied heart rates in patients with HFrEF in sinus 
rhythm, and those who achieved lower resting heart rates in dose-titrated randomized controlled 
trials had lower mortality.  This does not hold true for patients with concomitant AF, for whom 
there was no mortality benefit from beta-blockade, nor a relationship between heart rate and 
mortality.
