Research has indicated that many video games are saturated with stereotypes of
women and that these contents may cultivate sexism. The purpose of this study was
to assess the relationship between video game exposure and sexism for the fi
rst time
in a large and representative sample. Our aim was also to measure the strength of this
association when two other signifi
cant and well-studied sources of sexism, television
exposure and religiosity, were also included in a multivariate model. A representative
sample of 13520 French youth aged 11–19 years completed a survey measuring
weekly video game and television exposure, religiosity, and sexist attitudes toward
women. Controlling for gender and socioeconomic level, results showed that video
game exposure and religiosity were both related to sexism. Implications of these results
for future research on sexism in video games are discussed.

INTRODUCTION
The media are a powerful socializing agent of the modern era. Video games represent one of the
most popular forms of media entertainment around the world, with a global market of more than
90 billion dollars in 2015. Part of the popularity may be due to the appeal of masculinity: sales are
highest in teen and mature games with box art depicting non-central sexualized female characters
(Near, 2013). The depiction and value granted to women is biased in traditional forms of media
such as children’
s books, magazines and TV (Signorielli and Bacue, 1999; Scharrer, 2014), and
there is no obvious exception with new digital media. It has even been argued that some of the
most blatantly sexist representation of women is found today in video games (Dill and Thill, 2007;
Downs and Smith, 2010; Scharrer, 2014). However, while the proofs of biased depictions in video
games showing women as passive beings, kidnapped princess to rescue or sex objects to win or to
use are numerous and indisputably recorded (Provenzo, 1991; Beasley and Collins Standley, 2002;
Burgess et al., 2007; Dill and Thill, 2007; Near, 2013), their effect on gamers’
stereotypes of women
remains debated (Breuer et al., 2015) despite some preliminary experimental demonstrations (Dill
et al., 2008; Behm-Morawitz and Mastro, 2009; Fox and Bailenson, 2009; Yao et al., 2010; Driesmans
et al., 2015; Gabbiadini et al., 2016).
The present study used a large representative sample of adolescents to analyze the link between
video game exposure and the endorsement of sexist attitudes toward women. We also compare
this link to two other consequential and well-studied influences on sexist attitudes. The first is
television exposure, which has been shown as a major factor involved in sexist depiction of females

Video Games and Sexism
(Herrett-Skjellum and Allen, 1996; Morgan and Shanahan,
1997; Signorielli and Bacue, 1999; Oppliger, 2007). The other
important factor is religiosity, which has a significant influence
on stereotyped gender role beliefs (Wilson, 1978; Morgan, 1987;
Kirkpatrick, 1993; Hunsberger et al., 1999; Glick et al., 2002;
Meghan Burn and Busso, 2005; see, however, Read, 2003).
The introduction of these influential additional determinants of
sexism will provide us with the opportunity to have a more
precise and embedded view of the specific relationship between
video games exposure and sexism among adolescents.
Representation of Gender in Video Game
Since their origins, video games have tended to portray women
as characters needing help or holding passive or instrumental
roles (Downs and Smith, 2010; Near, 2013; Stermer and Burkley,
2015). In video game magazines, over 80% of female characters
are portrayed according to three types: sexualized, scantily clad,
or vision of beauty, and over a quarter fit in all three categories
(Dill and Thill, 2007). While it appears that women are generally
underrepresented in video games (Scharrer, 2004; Dill et al.,
2005; Williams et al., 2009; Downs and Smith, 2010), they are
frequently presented as attractive beings (Scharrer, 2004), sex
objects (Dietz, 1998; Burgess et al., 2007; Jansz and Martis,
2007; Downs and Smith, 2010) and in sexually suggestive ways
(Ivory, 2006). In one of the first extensive content analyses of
top selling games, Dietz (1998) showed that in over a quarter of
games women were depicted as sex objects. Other more recent
content analysis showed that women are often displayed with
revealing clothing or at least partially nude (Beasley and Collins
Standley, 2002; Miller and Summers, 2007; Downs and Smith,
2010). For example, in a systematic analysis of 47 randomly
selected games, female characters were more likely to wear
low-cut clothing and bare arms than males. Of the 71 female
characters for whom cleavage could be seen on, 2.82%, were
considered “
flat”
by independent judges, 56.34%, were considered
“
average,”and 40.85%, were considered “
voluptuous”(Beasley
and Collins Standley, 2002). Moreover, while male characters
have generally normal sizes in video games (compared to actual
sizes of adults), female characters are depicted as thinner (Martins
et al., 2011).
According to Bandura’
s Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura,
2001), symbolic representations of the world are learned
through exposure to models. People rely on such acquired
knowledge structures to perceive others and interact with them.
Developments in media psychology suggest that the digital
representation of the female body is not a mere innocent
succession of entertaining polychromatic polygons on a screen,
but can change users’
attitudes and behaviors off-screen (Yee and
Bailenson, 2007; Fox and Bailenson, 2009; Blascovitch and Mc
Call, 2014). Previous theoretical developments suggest that users
learn long-term schemas about gender, and that such schemas
influence everyday interactions in potentially detrimental ways
for women. According to the cultivation theory (Gerbner et al.,
1986), repeated exposure to media content influences how social
realities are perceived and understood. Adolescents who play
video games may model beliefs about gender role on the distorted
reality presented in video games. Relevant to the present study,
given that a high percentage of video games include sexist and
even misogynistic portrayals of females, we hypothesize that
more spent time playing video games should predict higher sexist
attitudes.
Because
video
games
are
designed
for
iterative
play
(potentially more than 100 h for the more developed products)
and are inherently interactive, they enable repeated and
distributed
learning
about
gender
roles
that
may
have
enduring effects. Video game characters can be agents of
gender socialization among youth, and the amount of exposure
to video games should predict the endorsement of gender
stereotypes. Some studies have supported this prediction. Several
experimental studies showed the short-term effect of sexualised
video games on sexist attitudes. These studies show that playing
sexualized video games for a few minutes (10–
20 min) promotes
men’
s likelihood to endorse gender stereotypes (Behm-Morawitz
and Mastro, 2009; Yao et al., 2010), increase hostile sexism (Fox
and Bailenson, 2009), and increases men’
s acceptance of sexual
harassment (Dill et al., 2008).
Fewer studies have been interested in long-term links between
video game and sexist attitudes. In one cross-sectional study,
it was shown that men who regularly played video games
with sexist contents (according to their own evaluation of
sexism) tended to have a higher level of benevolent sexism,
that is associated with perceptions of rigid gender roles and
is characterized by protective, patronizing attitudes toward
women (Stermer and Burkley, 2015). However, a longitudinal
study examining the influence of video game exposure on
sexist beliefs and attitudes over a 3 year period found
no evidence of a cultivation effect (Breuer et al., 2015).
Further cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are therefore
necessary.
In the present study, we were interested in the links between
video games and sexist attitudes and we focused on the largest
sample gathered to date on video games and sexism. We therefore
hypothesized a positive relationship between overall video game
exposure and the adherence to sexist attitudes (hypothesis 1).
We investigated television as a comparison variable, because
most of the available research on sexism and the media is
based on TV content (Herrett-Skjellum and Allen, 1996; Morgan
and Shanahan, 1997; Signorielli and Bacue, 1999; Coltrane and
Messineo, 2000; Oppliger, 2007; Valls-Fernández and Martínez-
Vicente, 2007; Nassif and Gunter, 2008; Eisend, 2010; Furnham
and Paltzer, 2010; Paek et al., 2011; Scharrer, 2014; Matthes et al.,
2016). As in other countries, French television depicts gender
roles in very stereotypical ways, as indicated by the gender of the
primary character, the associated product categories, the home
or work setting and the working role of the primary character
(Matthes et al., 2016).
It is therefore relevant to analyze simultaneously the respective
links of these two kinds of media on sexism. It can be expected
that the inherent interactivity of video game could prove to be
more influential than television. In a study on media violence, it
has been shown that children playing a violent video game were
then more aggressive than those who merely watched the same
violent video game in a passive way (Polman et al., 2008). We
therefore expected that the link between sexist attitudes would

Bègue et al.
Video Games and Sexism
be more strongly predicted by video game exposure than by TV
exposure (hypothesis 2).
Sexism as an Embedded Attitude
Although social psychological research has shown that sexist
attitudes or behavior may be temporarily increased even by
situational cues (Rudman and Phelan, 2010), sexism is generally
embedded in a mesh of cultural beliefs and grounded in social
and institutional practices. Long-term and institutional sources
of sexism may interact with media influences on sexism. Media
content may produce contrasted effects for different types of
people or in different social context (Morgan et al., 2009).
For example, although overall amount of television viewing
was related to the endorsement of anti-egalitarian gender roles
in a sample of Tokyo residents, the correlation was reversed
in a subsample of politically conservative participants (Saito,
2007). In some cultural contexts, therefore, media exposure may
counter gender stereotypes. For example, in Kuwait, exposure
to US television appears as a significant predictor of less,
and not more, gender stereotypical views (Abdulrahim et al.,
2009). Religion embodies an important and ubiquitous influence
on gender role representations (Morgan, 1987; Glick et al.,
2002; Christopher and Mull, 2006; Maltby et al., 2010), and
represents maybe the “
single most important shaper for sex
roles”(Wilson, 1978). We included religiosity in our model to
compare the effects of video game to ideological commitments
that consistently contribute to gender role beliefs. Many studies
carried out in Europe and North America have shown that
religiously affiliated people were more prone to support unequal
gender roles and to consider that women are first of all
housekeepers and mothers (Thornton et al., 1983; Wilcox and
Jelen, 1991; Sherkat and Ellison, 1999; Ghazel, 2003; Voicu,
2009).
We therefore expected that religiosity would be positively
related to sexism (hypothesis 3), but also that the link between
video game exposure and sexism would be lower among
high religious participants (hypothesis 4) following the above
research showing that media can challenge rigid sex roles among
traditional groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling Procedure and Participants
The sample included 13520 participants aged 11–
19 who were
selected at school through stratified random sampling and is
representative of the metropolitan areas of Grenoble and of
Lyon, France. These two cities are the major municipalities of
the second largest and wealthiest region of France. The sample
population corresponded to urban France in terms of age, sex and
school level. Students completed paper questionnaires in their
classrooms. An assistant was present in the room and helped
the participants upon request. The participation rate was slightly
above 95%.
The sample included both public and private schools (with the
rare exception of schools that have not contracted with the state)
and all curricula, professional as well as the general (the latter
being the pathway to college with the best students). National
Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies indicated that in the
year during which the survey was carried out, there were 99.4%
of youth attending school at 12, declining to 89% 1 year prior
to the baccalaureate1. After contacting all schools, half of them
declined to participate (the participation was 46/67 in Grenoble,
and 81/220 in Lyon, with a deficit in schools with reputation
for excellence or “
general curriculum”and the private schools).
Classes were randomly selected in each school grade of every
school. The sample is in line with the reference population in
terms of percentage of students per grade, age, gender according
to the available statistical elements provided by the education
authorities.
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the National Commission on
Computer and Freedoms (CNIL, decision n#2012-148). Ethics
in social studies in France is entrusted to the CNIL which
is a national independent body that has representatives in
universities. The present study categorized as sensitive was
therefore subjected to the most thorough examination by
the CNIL (the full review level 3). It includes questionnaire,
population, sampling process, data storage, and modalities for
obtaining the person’
s consent. Due to the juvenile status of
the population in its largest part, and the fact that the survey
took place at school, a multiple level consent process was
designed. The consent process was reviewed by the CNIL and
implemented along the lines of the CNIL. Consent of schools
was obtained in writing both from school heads and provincial
directorates of education (one for each sampling zone). Consent
of parents was asked through a home liaison diary which is the
usual means for communication between the school and the
family. The parents had to return an approval/refusal written
note (active consent). Children could orally refuse to participate
to the survey in full, even if their parents had approved the
survey. They also could omit responding to questions in the
questionnaire. All written consent material is retained by school
masters so that filed workers never learn any of the names of
the students. Statistical material about approval/refusal in each
classroom was communicated by the school head to the research
team.
MEASURES
All the measures were extracted from a larger survey based
on the ISRD 2 Questionnaire (Enzman et al., 2010). Gender
was coded as male = 1 (50.7%) or female = 2 (49.1%).
Participants ages ranged between 11 and 19 (M = 14.5;
SD = 1.36). As in other studies (e.g., Lien et al., 2001),
fathers’
educational level was used as a proxy for socioeconomic
status and was distributed into the following categories: (1) no
degree, (2) lower than baccalaureate, (3) hold a baccalaureate,
(4) higher than baccalaureate (M = 3,05; SD = 0.99). Albeit
1Baccalaureate is a school-leaving examination leading to university entrance
qualification in the French school system. In France, school is compulsory until
the age of 16.

Video Games and Sexism
less than optimal, such a measure enables an approximation
of socioeconomic status that is less subjected to biases or
missing values than other estimations in the context of a school
survey.
Media Exposure
Media exposure was assessed by the following question: “
How
many hours per day did you spend on average last week,
Monday to Friday playing computer or on the video game
console?”and “
How many hours per day did you spend on
average last week, Monday to Friday watching TV, DVDs, films
(including on the internet).”In order to ensure an appropriate
distribution of the variables, we created 10 categories, from
(1) 1 h per day to (10) 10 h or more per day. According to
their estimations, participants spent 2.77 h per day watching
TV (SD = 2.79) and 1.70 h per day playing video games
(SD = 2.63).
Although this measure cannot estimate the quantity of sexist
content adolescents were exposed to in video games and on
television, women are frequently portrayed in sexist ways (e.g.,
Dietz, 1998; Beasley and Collins Standley, 2002; Burgess et al.,
2007; Jansz and Martis, 2007; Downs and Smith, 2010), and this is
the case in French media (Matthes et al., 2016). Time exposure to
TV and video games may therefore be considered as an acceptable
proxy for general exposure to sexist contents.
Religiosity
Two measures of religiosity were included. Religious attendance
was assessed by asking respondents to report the frequency
they attended religious services, from never (1) to every
day (6). The denominations were: Catholics: 27.4%; Muslims:
25.9%; Protestants: 1.9%; Jews: 0.9%; Christian orthodox:
0.7%; Anglicans: 0.1; others 3.8. Moreover, 39.4% declared
no religion. Religious salience was measured by a 4-point
scale of how important religion is in participant’
s everyday
life ranging from not at all important (1) to very important
(4). The two measures being strongly related, we constructed
a composite measure (Cronbach’
s α = 0.72; M = 2.24;
SD = 1.07).
Sexism
Sexism was measured with a single-item question. Participants
were asked the following Likert-type question: “
A woman is made
mainly for making and raising children,”from fully disagree (1)
to fully agree (4), M = 1.53; SD = 0.9.
RESULTS
Preliminary analyses indicated that sexism was higher among
males (M = 1.71, SD = 0.98 vs. M = 1.35, SD = 0.77,
tcor(12922) = 23.59) and decreased as socioeconomic status
increased (r = −0.13, p < 0.001). Religiosity was related to higher
sexism (r = 0.23; p < 0.001). Television exposure (r = 0.08,
p < 0.001) and video game exposure (r = 0.15, p < 0.001) were
also both related to sexism at a bivariate level. The bivariate
correlations between all the variables are presented in Table 1.2
In order to test our primary hypotheses, a stepwise multiple
regression was performed entering age, gender, socioeconomic
level, religiosity, TV exposure and video games exposure in a first
step. We also introduced in a second step interactions between
video games exposure and age, gender, socioeconomic level, and
religiosity. As expected, video games exposure was related to
sexism (β = 0.07, t = 8.10, p < 0.001). This was also the case
of religiosity (β = 0.20, t = 23.92, p < 0.001). Sexism was
more endorsed by males (β = −0.18, t = −0.20.46, p < 0.001).
Moreover, higher socioeconomic level predicted lower sexism
(β = −0.09, t = −0.10,36, p < 0.001). After controlling for
all these variables, television exposure was unrelated to sexism
(β = 0.015, t = 1.66, p < 0.10). No interaction effects were
observed. The overall determination coefficient was R2 = 0.104,
p < 0.001.
DISCUSSION
In this cross-sectional study based on a representative sample
of 13520 French youth aged 11–
19 years, we showed that
general video game exposure was significantly related to sexism,
irrespective of gender, age, socioeconomic status, and religion.
We also observed that general television exposure was unrelated
to sexism after each of the variables were controlled. Of course,
2We performed bivariate analysis among the two largest religious groups: Catholics
and Muslims. The correlation between video game exposure and sexism was,
respectively, 0.18 and 0.11 (p < 0.001 for each). The correlation between television
exposure and sexism was 0.08 and 0. 01 (ns). This latest result is consistent with
studies showing that television impact on sexism is not homogeneous among social
subgroups (Saito, 2007; Abdulrahim et al., 2009).

Video Games and Sexism
the usual critiques aimed at cross-sectional surveys fully apply
here, particularly the limitations in terms of assessing causality. It
may be that individuals with sexist orientations spend more time
playing videogames (Fox and Tang, 2016). In order to address
causality issue, future experimental studies could be based on the
same protocol as Polman et al. (2008), who showed that people
were more influenced by the content of a scene where they were
actively playing themselves the game compared to a condition in
which they merely passively watched the screen with the same
contents.
It also should be noted that the determination coefficient
was small, which suggest that many important correlates of
sexism were not measured in our survey. For example, it has
been shown that sexism is related to gender inequality (Glick
et al., 2004; Napier et al., 2010), social dominance, right-wing
authoritarianism (Christopher and Mull, 2006), and conservative
values (Mikolajczak and Pietrzak, 2014). The mere introduction
of such social psychological variables may affect the predictive
value of general video game exposure.
Another limitation is the underrepresentation of some
categories of schools in our sample, with a deficit in schools
with reputation for excellence or “
general curriculum”and the
private schools. Studies suggest that sexism may be endorsed
more strongly in lower social classes (Gianettoni and Simon-
Vermot, 2010), which are usually less represented in such schools.
Such a sampling feature may have affected the results of the
survey.
It should also be mentioned that the use of a single-item scale
to assess sexism was less than optimal. This item was actually the
only measure of sexism in the ISRD2 survey, and represents a
very specific dimension of sexism (motherhood or domesticity)
that hardly captures all possible forms of sexist thinking. As
previously indicated, experimental studies showed that playing
sexualized video games for a few minutes promoted gender
stereotypes (Behm-Morawitz and Mastro, 2009; Yao et al., 2010),
increased hostile sexism (Fox and Bailenson, 2009), and men’
s
acceptance of sexual harassment (Dill et al., 2008). Future survey
studies should include measures of objectification and standard
measures of benevolent and hostile sexism (Glick and Fiske,
1996). Finally, we used a general measure of TV and video game
experience rather than measuring exposure to specifically sexist
portrayals.
A strength of this study is the multivariate approach, including
other known predictors of sexist attitudes. Video game exposure
was a significant factor even after controlling for age, sex,
socioeconomic level, television exposure, and religiosity, which is
considered a particularly strong determinant of sexism (Morgan,
1987; Glick et al., 2002; Christopher and Mull, 2006; Maltby
et al., 2010). The link between religion and sexism was, however,
three times higher than the links between video games and
sexism. Contrary to our expectations, the link between video
games exposure and sexism was not moderated by religion in
this sample. The importance of religiosity in the prediction of
sexism would justify a fine-grained approach in future research
based on religious orientations (Batson et al., 1993). Interestingly,
participants with a higher socioeconomic level endorsed less
sexism. This is consistent with a behavioral study carried out
in an online first shooters video game showing that low status
players were more hostile toward a female teammate, while high
status players were more positive toward her (Kasumovic and
Kuznekoff, 2015).
The causal link between video game exposure and sexism
in action deserves to be confirmed by experimental studies.
This is especially the case for sexist behaviors, which have
been under-studied (Stermer and Burkley, 2012). If confirmed,
however, the video game industry may find it appropriate to
encourage an evolution in the way women are represented,
because sexism on screen can have consequences which are
not limited to the virtual world. Today, 48% of video game
players are female (Entertainment Software Association, 2014),
and in addition to the development of sexist attitudes, the
repeated exposure to biased female models on games produces
body dissatisfaction among women (Holmstrom, 2004), self-
objectification (Fox et al., 2015) and eating disorders (Grabe et al.,
2008).
CONCLUSION
We showed for the first time in a large representative sample
that video game exposure was related to sexism, controlling for
television exposure, religiosity, and other relevant factors. Our
results suggest that a traditional source of influence (religiosity)
as well as new digital media may share some similar features on
sexism.
