ABSTRACT
Estimates of the incidence of radiocontrast-associated nephropathy vary widely and suffer from mis-
classification of the cause of AKI and confounding. Using the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, we created
multiple estimates of the risk of radiocontrast-associated nephropathy among adult patients hospitalized
in the United States in 2009. First, we stratified patients according to the presence or absence of 12
relatively common diagnoses associated with AKI and evaluated the rate of AKI between strata. Next, we
created a logistic regression model, controlling for comorbidity and acuity of illness, to estimate the risk of
AKI associated with radiocontrast administration within each stratum. Finally, we performed an analysis
stratified by the degree of preexisting comorbidity. In general, patients who received radiocontrast did
not develop AKI at a clinically significant higher rate. Adjusted only for the complex survey design, patients
to whom radiocontrast was and was not administered developed AKI at rates of 5.5% and 5.6%,
respectively. After controlling for comorbidity and acuity of illness, radiocontrast administration associ-
ated with an odds ratio for AKI of 0.93 (95% confidence interval, 0.88 to 0.97). In conclusion, the risk of
radiocontrast-associated nephropathy may be overstated in the literature and overestimated by clinicians.
More accurate AKI risk estimates may improve clinical decision-making when attempting to balance the
potential benefits of radiocontrast-enhanced imaging and the risk of AKI.

Iodinated radiocontrast agents have been known for
decades to cause AKI when administered intrave-
nously or intra-arterially. A widely cited paper pub-
lished in 2002 suggested that contrast-associated
nephropathy (CAN), also commonly referred to as
contrast-induced nephropathy, is the third most
common cause of AKI in hospitalized patients.1 Clin-
ical definitions and diagnostic criteria vary somewhat,
but generally, CAN is considered to be present when a
patient receives radiocontrast for an imaging study,
either intravenously or intra-arterially, and subse-
quently demonstrates a rise in the serum creatinine
concentration of either 44 mmol/L (0.5 mg/dl) or a
25% increase from baseline over the ensuing 24–72
hours. The diagnosis is notably one of exclusion and
can only be made if AKI cannot reasonably be attrib-
uted to another etiology.
There is little agreement in the medical literature
regarding the incidence of CAN. Published rates
range from ,1% to .30%.2–6 In fact, at least two
prospective studies failed to show any increase in
the rate of AKI in patients receiving radiocontrast
when compared with materially similar patients
who did not receive radiocontrast.7,8 Although ef-
forts were undertaken in both studies to match
controls to cases, residual confounding renders
these results difficult to interpret. Patients receiv-
ing radiocontrast are generally sicker than those
who do not receive radiocontrast; conversely, pa-
tients with diminished kidney function or those
patients perceived by their physicians to be at in-
creased risk for AKI (e.g., older persons, or persons

 with underlying CKD or diabetes mellitus) may be less likely
to receive radiocontrast.9 Indirect evidence from studies that
evaluate fluctuations in serum creatinine absent the adminis-
tration of radiocontrast also suggests that published incidence
rates of CAN may be inflated. For example, a recently pub-
lished study reported a high incidence of transient creatinine
fluctuations in hospitalized patients who had not received ra-
diocontrast.10,11 Another study compared rates of transient
creatinine fluctuation among patients receiving radiocontrast
and nonradiocontrast computed tomography (CT) scans and
noted an increased risk of AKI among patients who did not
undergo a radiocontrast study when compared with those re-
ceiving the radiocontrast agent iohexol.10 Recently, McDonald
et al. published the results of a large retrospective analysis that
employed propensity score matching to compare risk of AKI
after contrast and noncontrast-enhanced CT scanning; they
found no increase in the incidence of AKI after administration
of intravenous contrast, even among high risk groups (for
example, patients with baseline CKD or diabetes mellitus).12
In this study, we sought to estimate the burden of AKI
among patients receiving radiocontrast, as compared with
patients with similar comorbidity and severity of illness who
did not receive radiocontrast during their hospitalization. We
hypothesized that the risk of AKI in patients who received
radiocontrast would not be dramaticallydifferent from the risk
in patients who did not receive radiocontrast.
RESULTS
Study Sample
TheentireNationwideInpatientSample(NIS) datasetfor2009
consisted of 7,810,762 hospitalizations. After restricting our
sample to hospitalizations for patients older than 18 years with
lengths of stay 10 days or fewer, we were left with 5,931,523
hospitalizations for analysis (Figure 1).
Study Subject Characteristics
Figure 2 summarizes demographic and comorbidity data for the
study sample. Patients receiving radiocontrast were older, dispro-
portionately male,and more likely to be white.Radiocontrast was
more commonly administered at teaching hospitals. Patients not
receiving radiocontrast had a higher comorbidity score.
Risk of AKI
In the entire sample, AKI developed in 5.5% of patients who
received radiocontrast and 5.6% of patients who did not. In the
stratified analyses, for some disease states (Table 1), radiocon-
trast administration was associated with a higher risk of AKI:
sepsis (35.8% versus 32.9%), pneumonia (16.3% versus
12.7%), urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis (17.4% versus
15.7%), peritonitis (31.4% versus 28.9%), gastrointestinal
bleeding (16.8% versus 13.8%), chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease exacerbation (16.3% versus 15.1%), and acute
pancreatitis (16.4% versus 8.2%). In general, differences in
risk between groups were small, roughly 2%–3% absolute,
15%–20% relative. The notable exception was acute pancrea-
titis; for these patients radiocontrast administration was asso-
ciated with a doubling in risk of AKI. For several other disease
states, patients who received radiocontrast experienced an un-
expectedly lower rate of AKI: heart failure exacerbation
(16.6% versus 19.0%), endocarditis (16.4% versus 19.9%),
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (6.4% versus 17.4%), venous
thromboembolism (6.9% versus 9.2%), and stroke/cerebro-
vascular accident (6.7% versus 7.5%). These results are sum-
marized in Table 2 and depicted graphically in Figure 3.
In the unadjusted model (adjusted only for survey design),
the administration of radiocontrast was associated with a
nonsignificant2%loweroddsofAKI;thediscriminationofthis
model was poor (concordance statistic [c-statistic], 0.50).
Adjustedforage,sex,mechanicalventilation,andcomorbidity,
the administration of radiocontrast was associated with a 7.4%
(95% confidence interval, 2.6% to 12.0%) reduction in the
odds of AKI. Model discrimination was very good (c-statistic,
0.82) (Table 3). These results suggest a negligible to at most
modest increase in risk attributable to radiocontrast.
Finally, we performed an analysis stratified for degree of
comorbidity (Table 4). The risk of AKI was higher with higher
comorbidity scores in both groups (exposed and not exposed
to radiocontrast).
DISCUSSION
Using a dataset that contains 8,000,000 hospitalizations,
representing 96% of the United States population, our analyses
suggest that the incremental risk of AKI that can be attributed
to radiocontrast is modest at worst, and almost certainly over-
estimated by patients, physicians, surgeons, radiologists, and
other decision-makers. This relation between radiocontrast

 exposureandAKIvariesaccordingtototalcomorbidityandacuity
ofillness,andismodifiedby thepresenceofspecificdiseasestates.
For example, across the entire hospitalized adult population,
adjusting only for the complex survey design, the risk of AKI in
patients receiving and not receiving radiocontrast was virtually
identical (5.5% versus 5.6%, respectively) and notably similar to
other published reports.13 Similarly, when controlling for demo-
graphic features, mechanical ventilation, and a previously vali-
datedcombined comorbidityscore, radiocontrast administration
is associated with 7% lower (relative) odds of AKI. Taken to-
gether, these surprising results suggest that the risk of AKI that
can reasonably be attributed to radiocontrast (the so-called
“attributable risk”) is likely to be much lower than frequently
assumed.
Data from the disease-specific strata offer additional
insight. For example, the risk of AKI among persons with
ACS (including ST segment elevation and non-ST segment
elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina) who
receive radiocontrast is actually lower, and considerably so,
than among those patients who did not receive a radiocontrast
study. It is very unlikely that radiocontrast “protects” patients
with ACS from developing AKI. Rather, this paradox could be
explained by the fact that patients who are deemed by clinicians
to be at highest risk for AKI are treated in such a way as to
minimize perceived risk. Indeed, clinically indicated angio-
graphic studies may be delayed or withheld.9 In contrast, the
opposite pattern is seen for patients with acute pancreatitis, a
condition where most patients do not receive a radiocontrast
study as part of standard of care. However, with persistent fever,
pain, and leukocytosis, radiocontrast-enhanced CTmay be in-
dicated to investigate the possibility of pancreatic necrosis or
the development of a phlegmon or other complication. There-
fore, although in the setting of pancreatitis the risk of AKI
doubled with radiocontrast exposure, much of that observed
increased risk could be attributed to other causes, and yet ra-
diocontrast might be “blamed.”
Asis evidenced from thediscussion above, determination of
the true rate of CAN would be very difficult even if more
detailed clinical data were available. Simply put, the relation
between radiocontrast administration and AKI is highly

 confounded, unpredictable, and sometimes bidirectional.
Sicker patients typically require more extensive and defined
imagingstudies,althoughinsomesettings,patientsconsidered
to be at high risk for AKI may be less likely to undergo
radiocontrast-enhanced testing. This potentially bidirectional
relationship may underlie our potentially counterintuitive
result seen in Table 4; although the rate of AKI increases as the
combined comorbidity score increases in both the contrast
and noncontrast groups, the odds of AKI are actually greater
in the noncontrast groups among persons with a combined
comorbidity score of less than five. This
pattern may primarily reflect patient selec-
tion: among low risk patients, physicians
identify patients at high risk for AKI and
administer contrast accordingly; however,
for the sickest patients in whom the risk of
AKI is greatest, there may be less perceived
choice about the administration of contrast
which, in the case of the sickest patients,
may be life-saving.
It will not be feasible to randomize
patients to contrast-enhanced versus non-
contrast-enhanced imaging strategies, leav-
ing all other care unchanged, to determine
the degree to which radiocontrast directly
increases AKI risk, although some sophis-
ticated study designs and analyses can come
close. Most notably, in a series of influen-
tial papers, McDonald and colleagues
assembled a retrospective, single-site co-
hort of patients undergoing either intrave-
nous contrast-enhanced CT imaging or
noncontrast-enhanced CT.12,14,15 The re-
searchers limited the sample to patients
with sufficient data to assess baseline kidney function and
relevant comorbidities, as well as determine the rate of AKI
in the 24–72 hours after imaging. Secondary outcomes includ-
ing death or dialysis within 30 days of imaging were also eval-
uated. The analysis took a multipronged approach including
stratification on the basis of baseline kidney function, use of
propensity score for adjustment and a 1:1 matching analysis,
and an elegant counterfactual analysis taking advantage of the
fact that many patients received both contrast-enhanced and
noncontrast studies at different time points, thus providing

 their own control. Rates of AKI, death, and dialysis were
roughly similar to previously published reports but did not
differ significantly between the contrast and noncontrast group
in any analysis variation. Our study affirms and builds on this
important work: despite a different data source and analytic
methods, our result is materially similar. Given that this result
may run counter to longstanding physician beliefs about the
risk of radiocontrast and practices related to those beliefs, it is
important to confirm a potentially controversial and practice-
changing result in multiple studies and settings.
The strengths of our study include the use of avery large and
nationally representative dataset that contains data for all
payers, the only dataset of its kind in the United States. Our
study also benefits from two separate analyses (stratified by
disease state and logistic regression model controlled for
comorbidity and acuity of illness), each in an effort to illumi-
nate the problem of making a meaningful comparison of two
intrinsically different patient groups (i.e., those who do and
do not receive radiocontrast). The results were consistent,
another strength when considering interpretation of our
results.
Our data source, although large and nationally represen-
tative, carries several important limitations. First, the defini-
tion of AKI is based exclusively on administrative diagnosis
codes which are likely to be less sensitive for the identification
of AKI than clinical data. However, we report an overall rate of
AKI very similar to studies which used clinical data to identify
AKI. Second, as discussed in detail in our Concise Methods
section, we were unable to determine with certainty that the
administration of contrast preceded the diagnosis of AKI
within any particular hospitalization. We have mitigated this
risk by limiting our analysis to relatively short hospitalizations
but the issue could not be completely eliminated; this is a
weakness intrinsic to the dataset itself.
The value gained and the risk incurred by imaging studies in
general, and radiocontrast-enhanced imaging studies in par-
ticular, remain critically important questions in general
medical and surgical care, cardiology, oncology, and other
medical and surgical subspecialties. Indeed, the US Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program and the
George Institute recently launched a large randomized clinical
trial of two prophylactic strategies aimed to reduce the risk of
radiocontrast nephropathy after angiography. Unfortunately,
because all participants in the Veterans Affairs Cooperative Study
will be exposed to radiocontrast, the trial will not determine the
degree to which radiocontrast increases the risk of AKI. Although
we await additional prospective data, we suspect that, on the basis
of existing assumptions regarding attributable risk, diagnostic
studies and some interventions that might save or improve lives
are being withheld from patients owing to an exaggerated fear of
radiocontrast nephropathy.
However, we would also extend a word of caution regarding
interpretation of these results and results from similar studies:
to date there have been no randomized studies of the risk of
radiocontrast administration. Even sophisticated analyses may
fail to detect the full effect of patient selection on their results
and, in that case, mayerroneouslyconclude that there is no real
risk to patients, even those previously believed to be high risk
suchaspatientswithCKDordiabetes.Ifphysiciansareexpertly
identifying patients truly at increased risk for AKI after
radiocontrast administration, that selection bias may mask a
true effect of contrast in analyses such as ours and the study
performed by McDonald et al.12 For this reason, we must in-
terpret this study and similar studies with caution, carefully
weighing the benefit of a contrast-enhanced study with the
risk, likely low but likely not zero, of radiocontrast adminis-
tration on the kidney.

 CONCISE METHODS
Data Source and Study Population
Data for this study were drawn from the NIS, the largest publicly avail-
able all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. The NIS is a
20% stratified sample of discharges from United States hospitals; the
sample contains administrative data from approximately 8,000,000
hospitalizations per year. More than 1000 hospitals contribute to the
database, from 45 states, representing 96% of the United States popula-
tion. Sample weights are provided to allow the generation of national
estimates. The NISwas developed as part of the familyof databases that
comprise the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) and is
sponsored by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
For these analyses, we utilized the 2009subset, the most recent year
available at the time of data analysis. We included patients at least 18
years old at the time of admissionwith an admitting diagnosis other than
AKI.Welimitedourstudy populationtothosehospitalizations10daysor
fewer in length to reduce misclassification of CAN (Figure 1).
Study Variables
The NIS, although enormously powerful given its very large size, has
several notable limitations. First, the NIS contains no detailed clinical or
laboratory data; therefore, we relied on administrative data to identify the
dependent variable (AKI), the key independent variable (radiocontrast
exposure), and other covariates. Second, the number of diagnoses and
procedures listed for any single hospitalization is limited; the dataset
contains up to 25 diagnosis codes and up to 15 procedure codes for each
hospitalization. Third, procedure and diagnosis codes have no associated
dates, preventing us from determining the sequence of events within each
hospitalization. Finally, because there are no patient identifiers, multiple
hospitalizations within individual patients cannot be tracked. Given that
administration of radiocontrast before the diagnosis of AKI is central to
the diagnosis of CAN, this imprecision in the data represents a major
limitation. We addressed this limitation by restricting our study sample to
hospitalizations lasting 10 days or fewer, reducing the likelihood that we
would include a hospitalization in our analysis where radiocontrast
preceded AKI but was separated by an extended time period (indicating
AKIfromanothercause)orwhereradiocontrastwasadministeredafterthe
developmentofAKI,whereitmightcontributeto,butnotincite,theevent.
The primary outcome for our study was AKI, as determined by
International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision Codes (ICD9)
diagnosis code. The primary independent variable was radiocontrast
administration, as determined by ICD9 procedure code. Covariates
included age, sex, the Romano implementation of the combined
Charlson/Elixhauser comorbidity index, and the presence or absence
of a procedure code for mechanical ventilation to control for acuity of
illness. The combined comorbidity index included ICD9 diagnosis
codes to identify myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure,
peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia,
chronic pulmonary disease, rheumatologic disease, peptic ulcer
disease, liver disease, diabetes, hemi/paraplegia, renal disease, malig-
nancy including metastatic disease, and AIDS.16 Additional analyses
were conducted on samples stratified by 12 disease states: heart failure
exacerbation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation,
sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection/pyelonephritis, endocar-
ditis, peritonitis, venous thromboembolism including deep venous
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, ACS, stroke/cerebrovascular
accident, acute pancreatitis, and gastrointestinal bleeding. A full list
of ICD9 codes employed in the analysis are summarized in Table 1.
Statistical Analyses
Characteristics of patients who did and did not receive radiocontrast were
compared using the median (interquartile range) for continuous variables
(age) and percentages for categoric variables. We compared the risk of AKI
for patients who did and did not receive contrast among the entire sample
andstratified by thediseasestateslistedaboveusingthechi-squaredtestfor
statistical significance. We compared the odds of AKI as a function of
contrast administration by fitting logistic regression models. We fitted
unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted models; the latter adjusted for age,
sex,combinedcomorbidity,andmechanicalventilation.Wegaugedmodel
discrimination by the area of the receiver operating characteristic curve,
depicted with the c-statistic. For a more intuitive interpretation of this
model, we additionally calculated the predicted marginal percentages and
differences for the risk of AKI associated with contrast administration,
stratified by degree of preexisting comorbidity. The predicted marginal
percent forcontrast/no contrast categories represents the average predicted
responseassumingthatallcovariatesinthecontrastcategoryaredistributed
similarly to the whole population. All analyses presented account for the
complex survey design (weighting and stratification) and subpopulation
estimation using survey-specific procedures in the Statistical Analysis
System(SAS)andvariablesforstrataandweightsasprovidedbytheHCUP
to allow for accurate national estimates. We created the cohort using SAS
software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC); and we conducted the
analyses using StataMP
, version 12 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX).
