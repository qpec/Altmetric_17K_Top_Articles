Physical forces affect tumour growth, progression and metastasis. Here, we develop
polymeric mechanical amplifiers that exploit in vitro and in vivo physical forces to increase
immune cytokine-mediated tumour cell apoptosis. Mechanical amplifiers, consisting of
biodegradable polymeric particles tethered to the tumour cell surface via polyethylene glycol
linkers, increase the apoptotic effect of an immune cytokine on tumour cells under fluid shear
exposure by as much as 50% compared with treatment under static conditions. We show
that targeted polymeric particles delivered to tumour cells in vivo amplify the apoptotic effect
of a subsequent treatment of immune cytokine, reduce circulating tumour cells in blood and
overall tumour cell burden by over 90% and reduce solid tumour growth in combination with
the antioxidant resveratrol. The work introduces a potentially new application for a broad
range of micro- and nanoparticles to maximize receptor-mediated signalling and function in
the presence of physical forces.

eceptor-mediated signalling in biological systems is essen-
tial for the exchange of information between cells and the
extracellular environment, and contributes to important
cellular phenomenon including growth, survival, differentiation,
ageing and death1. To exert greater control of receptor–ligand
interactions and signalling, nanotechnology-based platforms that
interface with the cell surface are being developed2. Nanoscale
surface engineering of materials is being used to mimic receptor–
ligand interactions in vivo, to support cell survival and guide
cellular behaviour for various biomedical applications3. In
addition, nanoparticles have shown potential in manipulating
receptor-mediated signalling, exerting control over receptor
clustering for the induction of receptor-mediated signalling4,5.
Nanoparticles
have
also
demonstrated
promise
in
the
spatiotemporal control of gene interference within cells that can
be remotely controlled using light6. The majority of studies have
demonstrated control of receptor-mediated phenomena using
nanoparticles in vitro, and few studies have demonstrated such
control in vivo.
Receptor-mediated signalling in response to mechanical forces
is also under intense study, and plays an important role in
embryonic
development
and
adult
physiology,
while
also
contributing to numerous diseases including atherosclerosis,
osteoporosis and cancer7. For example, blood flow exerts shear
stress on endothelial cell-lined vessels in vivo, and plays an
essential role in vascular remodelling and branching8. Conversely,
atherosclerotic plaques that can trigger cardiovascular disease
preferentially form under disturbed physiological flows and shear
stress at the branch points of vessels9. Malignant cells are also
exposed to a wide range of physiological fluid shear forces in vivo,
including high shear stress (0.5–30.0 dyn cm � 2) in the circulation
generated by blood flow and low shear stress (B0.1 dyn cm � 2) in
soft tissues generated by interstitial flow10. Such forces can trigger
mechanotransduction in tumour cells at the receptor level both
in vitro and in vivo, which can affect tumour progression11–15.
Drug resistance also plays a key role in tumour progression,
and is commonly implicated in the failure of therapeutic
regimens. Despite an initial therapeutic response, tumours, in
part because of their heterogeneity, can regrow and manifest
resistance to the initially successful therapeutic16,17. Thus, many
drugs are used in combination with other chemical agents to
sensitize tumour cells and overcome drug resistance. Therapies
based on the tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), an immune cytokine, are of heightened interest
because of its capacity to trigger receptor-mediated apoptosis in
cancer cells. TRAIL exerts cytotoxic effects on tumour cells while
sparing normal cells, and has shown promise in treating solid
tumours and metastatic tumour cells18,19. As such, TRAIL has
long been a target for clinicians and researchers as a cancer
therapeutic that avoids the debilitating effects of conventional
chemotherapies20. Several drugs targeting TRAIL death receptors
4 (DR4) and 5 (DR5) on the tumour cell surface are currently
undergoing clinical trials, and show little toxicity21. Although
treatment has shown some efficacy in subsets of patients, TRAIL
resistance remains a major clinical barrier and limits broad
efficacy21.
To overcome resistance, several agents have been combined
with TRAIL to sensitize tumour cells to apoptosis, including
conventional chemotherapeutics (that is, doxorubicin, cisplatin),
proteasome inhibitors, quercetin, BCL2 (B-cell lymphoma 2)
inhibitors, IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis protein) antagonists,
CD20 antibodies, irradiation, Sorafenib, aspirin, histone deacety-
lase inhibitors and natural products such as resveratrol and
piperlongumine22. Although numerous chemical sensitization
approaches have been demonstrated, it is difficult to assess the
appropriate sensitizer for a particular patient, given that multiple
known TRAIL resistance mechanisms exist, in addition to those
that have not been identified23. Furthermore, several chemical
sensitizers, such as doxorubicin, induce systemic toxicity in vivo
and
thus
negate
the
low
toxicity
advantages
of
TRAIL
administration22.
Although
numerous
groups
have
studied
the effect of chemical sensitizers, to our knowledge no one has
explored leveraging mechanical stimulation as a means to
increase TRAIL sensitivity while sparing normal cells in vivo.
Herein, we develop polymeric mechanical amplifiers that
leverage fluid shear stress to enhance receptor-mediated tumour
cell apoptosis. The approach, consisting of degradable and
nondegradable polymeric particles bound to the cell surface via
polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers, enhance receptor-mediated
signalling and apoptosis of TRAIL-treated tumour cells in the
presence of fluid shear forces. When administered in vivo,
surface-bound particles enhance the apoptotic effect of a
subsequent treatment of soluble TRAIL, and reduce circulating
tumour cell burden and solid tumour growth. These mechanical
amplifiers have negligible toxic effects on normal cells, and can be
combined with a range of natural products to exert synergistic
apoptotic effects on tumour cells.
Results
Fluid shear increases immune cytokine-mediated apoptosis.
To
examine
how
physical
forces
affect
TRAIL-mediated
tumour
cell
apoptosis,
tumour
cells
in
suspension
were
treated with TRAIL in vitro and exposed to physiologically
relevant fluid shear stress (Supplementary Fig. 1a). In the
presence of fluid shear stress, significant increases in tumour cell
killing were observed in TRAIL-treated human colon, prostate
and breast tumour cells as compared with those treated under
static conditions (Supplementary Fig. 1b–d). Increased tumour
cell killing in the presence of fluid forces was observed in both
TRAIL-sensitive (COLO 205) and TRAIL-resistant (MCF7)
tumour cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b–d). Normal cells with neg-
ligible TRAIL sensitivity, including human peripheral blood
mononuclear leukocytes and human endothelial cell monolayers,
were not sensitized to TRAIL-mediated killing upon shear stress
exposure (Supplementary Fig. 1h,i). Across a range of fluid shear
forces characteristic of those in soft tissues and in the vascular
microenvironment, it was evident that increased shear force
enhanced TRAIL-mediated tumour cell killing (Supplementary
Fig. 1e–g). We then assessed whether shear force exposure
increased
TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis
via
caspase-mediated
signalling, which is triggered upon TRAIL binding to death
receptors DR4 and DR5 (ref. 24). Indeed, treatment with the
general
caspase
inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK
abolished
TRAIL-
mediated tumour cell killing in the presence of fluid shear
stress (Supplementary Fig. 1j). These data suggest that physiolo-
gical forces exerted on tumour cells enhance the therapeutic effect
of TRAIL. Building upon previous work, which suggested that
shear forces increase the killing of TRAIL-sensitive tumour cells
in vitro25, this work indicates that mechanical forces increased
both TRAIL-sensitive and TRAIL-resistant tumour cell killing,
with negligible toxic effects on normal cells.
Polymeric mechanical amplifiers. Although our data suggest
that mechanical forces sensitize tumour cells to receptor-medi-
ated apoptosis, fluid shear forces are highly variable in vivo. Thus,
we investigated whether biocompatible polymeric particles con-
jugated to the tumour cell surface act to locally amplify the forces
exerted on the tumour cell membrane. By locally increasing the
physical force exerted on the cell surface, it is possible to amplify
the apoptotic effect of TRAIL on target tumour cells without
altering the fluid forces of the surrounding area. To accomplish

 this, we stably conjugated polymeric particles across a range of
sizes (diameter: 100–1,000 nm) to the tumour cell surface via free
amine coupling using N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)–PEG12–
biotin heterobifunctional linkers (Fig. 1a,b). For this study, we
chose nondegradable polystyrene (PS) and degradable poly(lactic-
co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles given their biocompatibility,
biodegradability and current use in in vivo clinical appli-
cations26–28. Particles were stably bound to the surface of colon
and prostate tumour cells (Fig. 1c), with minimal internalization
observed in the overall cell population after treatment and 4 h
post treatment (Fig. 1d). Although some polymeric particles
adsorbed to the tumour cell surface without PEG linkers in a
nonspecific manner, these particles were easily removed from
B95% of the overall cell population during mild cell washing
steps (Fig. 1e,g). However, polymeric particles conjugated to the
cell surface using PEG linkers remained bound to 499% of the
overall cell population after exposure to identical washing steps
(Fig.
1f,g).
Hundreds
of
polymeric
particles
were
stably
conjugated to the tumour cell surface using this technique, with
negligible effects on cell viability (Supplementary Fig. 3).
Fluorescence readings indicated that a negligible amount of
fluorescent particles remained in suspension after functionali-
zation as compared with controls (Supplementary Fig. 4a). In
addition, flow cytometry results showed a normal Gaussian
distribution of fluorescent cells post functionalization, indicating
that the majority of the tumour cell population was uniformly
functionalized with particles (Supplementary Fig. 4b). Further-
more, conjugation of particles to the tumour cell surface did not
significantly interfere with the ability of TRAIL to interact with
death receptors DR4 and DR5, as no significant differences in cell
viability were observed post treatment (Supplementary Fig. 5).
This finding suggests that PEG linkers enable stable conjugation
of polymeric particles to the tumour cell surface with minimal
internalization, and has negligible effects on both cell viability and
TRAIL-mediated signalling under static conditions.
Mechanical amplification of tumour cell apoptosis in vitro.
Given that fluid shear stress enhanced TRAIL-mediated tumour
cell killing (Supplementary Fig. 1), we then investigated whether
polymeric particles conjugated to the tumour cell surface amplify
the apoptotic effect of TRAIL in the presence of shear forces
(Fig. 2a). Under both shear and static conditions, particle con-
jugation to the tumour cell surface had no effect on viability in
the absence of TRAIL (Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore,
conjugation of particles across a range of sizes (100–1,000 nm) to
the cell surface had no effect on TRAIL-mediated killing under
static conditions (Supplementary Fig. 7). However, particles
tethered to the cell surface amplified TRAIL-mediated colon and
prostate cancer cell killing in the presence of fluid shear stress
(Fig. 2b–d). Specifically, conjugation of particles of increased size
had a pronounced effect on TRAIL-mediated tumour cell killing

 in the presence of fluid shear stress as compared with treatment
in the absence of particles. Increased tumour cell killing in the
presence of larger particles could be due to greater compressive
forces exerted on the tumour cell membrane in the presence of
fluid shear stress. Two spherical particles will experience a
compressive force (Fc) between them when colliding in a linear
shear flow that scales as FcBmGab, where m is the fluid viscosity,
G is the shear rate, and a and b are the radii of the smaller and
larger sphere, respectively29. Therefore, a 10 mm diameter tumour
cell colliding with a 100 nm particle will experience 10 times the

normal cells, as particle conjugation to both human peripheral

TRAIL-mediated

(Supplementary Fig. 8). This finding suggests that polymeric
particles can be utilized to amplify TRAIL-mediated tumour cell
killing in the presence of fluid shear stress while sparing normal
cells.
TRAIL resistance in tumour cell types is a major challenge to
its broad use in cancer therapy22,30. To examine the potential of
our approach to overcome resistance, we conducted experiments
using HT29 colon cancer cells that have been shown to be TRAIL
resistant31–34. Our results confirm that TRAIL treatment under
static conditions has minimal effects on HT29 cell viability
(Fig. 2e). However, a significant decrease in HT29 cell viability
was measured when cells were functionalized with particles and
then treated with TRAIL in the presence of fluid shear stress
(Fig.
2e).
We
then
assessed
whether
our
particle-based
approach
in
combination
with
piperlongumine,
a
natural
alkaloid
shown
to
sensitize
tumour
cells
to
TRAIL
via
upregulation of DR5 expression, can further increase tumour
cell killing35. Indeed, combining piperlongumine with our
approach induced a fivefold greater tumour cell death than
TRAIL
treatment
alone.
These
results
suggest
that
our
particle-based approach can act in combination with chemical
sensitizers to increase TRAIL-resistant tumour cell killing in the
presence of physical forces. Given that TRAIL combination
therapies with various classes of sensitizers are being explored in
preclinical and clinical trials22,30,36, we envision that our
nontoxic, particle-based approach can act in combination with
sensitizers to exert synergistic apoptotic effects on TRAIL-
resistant tumour cells.
We then compared mechanical amplification of tumour cell
killing with treatment with doxorubicin. Doxorubicin also
triggers tumour cell apoptosis, but through intracellular mechan-
isms including inhibition of topo-isomerase II and DNA
intercalation37.
Although
polymeric
particles
amplified
the
effect of TRAIL in the presence of fluid shear stress (Fig. 2c–e),
they did not enhance the therapeutic effect of doxorubicin
(Fig. 2f), demonstrating that such an approach is specific to
receptor-mediated therapeutics. Upon analysing the mode of
tumour cell death using an annexin-V/propidium iodide (PI)
assay, increased tumour cell killing using our approach occurred
almost entirely via increased apoptosis (Fig. 2g–j). Conjugation of
particles to the cell surface nearly doubled the number of
apoptotic prostate and colon cancer cells in the presence of fluid
shear stress as compared with treatment under static conditions
(Fig. 2i,j). Furthermore, no significant differences in tumour cell
necrosis were observed (Supplementary Fig. 9). Given that TRAIL
primarily triggers cell death via apoptosis rather than necrosis, the
annexin-V/PI assay further suggests that mechanical ampli-
fication of apoptosis using polymeric particles is TRAIL specific
and does not exert separate cytotoxic effects.
In addition to nondegradable particles, we sought to utilize
biodegradable polymeric PLGA particles to mechanically amplify
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Biodegradable particles such as
PLGA are particularly advantageous for in vivo administration,
where the material can degrade in a safe manner38,39. PLGA
particles functionalized with an epithelial cell adhesion molecule
(EpCAM)-targeting antibody, which binds to EpCAM expressed
on tumour cells of epithelial origin40, were bound to the tumour
cell surface with minimal effects on cell viability under shear and
static conditions (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Furthermore, PLGA
particles did not hinder TRAIL-mediated killing under static
conditions (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Similar to nondegradable
particles (Fig. 2b–e), biodegradable particles amplified the
apoptotic effect of TRAIL in the presence of fluid shear stress
as compared with samples in the absence of particles (Fig. 2k).
This finding suggests that biodegradable polymeric particles can
also be utilized to amplify TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in the
presence of fluid shear stress.
Our results with larger polymeric particles conjugated to the
tumour cell surface showed increased TRAIL-mediated tumour
cell killing under shear, suggesting that greater force exerted by
larger particles increased the effect of TRAIL (Fig. 2). To assess
the effects of both shear stress exposure and particle size, tumour
cells were conjugated with polymeric particles across a range of
sizes (200–1,000 nm) before TRAIL treatment under varied fluid
shear stress (1.0–12.0 dyn cm � 2; Fig. 3a). Higher shear stress
values were not examined in vitro because of cell delamination
and reduced cell recovery from the viscometer device (Supple-
mentary Fig. 11). Particles across the range of sizes increased
TRAIL-mediated tumour cell killing with increasing fluid shear
stress exposure (Fig. 3a). In addition, increased TRAIL-mediated
tumour cell killing was observed when cells were bound to larger
particles at a given fluid shear stress as compared with smaller
particles (Fig. 3a). For example, although a 200 nm particle had
minimal effect on TRAIL-mediated tumour cell killing at a low
fluid shear stress (1.0 dyn cm � 2), functionalization with larger
particles (1,000 nm) significantly increased tumour cell killing
(Fig. 3a). These results suggest that particle size and shear stress
exposure both act to modulate TRAIL-mediated tumour cell
killing. In addition, we treated tumour cells with varying numbers
of particles (concentration: 0–480 particles per cell) before TRAIL
treatment under shear exposure (Fig. 3b). In the absence of

 TRAIL, increasing numbers of particles had no significant effect
on cell viability under shear or static conditions (Supplementary
Fig. 12). In the presence of TRAIL, increased particle conjugation
increased tumour cell killing under shear conditions (Fig. 3c,d).
Increased particle conjugation did not affect tumour cell killing
under static conditions (Fig. 3c,d), providing further evidence that
the apoptotic effect of TRAIL is amplified by particles specifically
in the presence of fluid shear stress. Furthermore, the apoptotic
effect of TRAIL increased with greater numbers of particles
conjugated to the cell surface (Fig. 3e,f), whereas no significant
differences in cellular necrosis were measured (Fig. 3g,h). In
addition, particle functionalization had no effect on tumour cell
apoptosis and necrosis in the absence of TRAIL, regardless of the
number of particles (Supplementary Fig. 13). These data provide
further evidence that mechanical amplification of TRAIL-
mediated tumour cell killing occurs via apoptosis, and can be
modulated by (1) altering particle size, (2) increasing shear force
exposure and (3) increasing the number of particles tethered to
the tumour cell surface.
Mechanical amplification of caspase signalling. To assess
whether amplification of receptor-mediated apoptosis in the
presence of fluid shear stress is dependent on caspase signalling,
we treated particle-functionalized tumour cells with the general
caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK. Minimal membrane blebbing,
indicative of reduced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, was observed in
samples treated with Z-VAD-FMK (Fig. 4a). No significant
decreases in viability were measured in Z-VAD-FMK-treated
samples as compared with viable controls (Fig. 4b). Given that
TRAIL primarily induces extrinsic apoptosis via caspase-8, cells
were also treated with the caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK, and
similar results were observed compared with general caspase
inhibition
(Fig.
4b).
Furthermore,
Annexin-V/PI
assays
showed reduced apoptosis when treated with Z-VAD-FMK or
Z-IETD-FMK (Fig. 4c–e). We then labelled for biomarkers of
caspase-8 activation using a caspase-8 activity assay. TRAIL
treatment alone induced a 3-fold increase in caspase-8 activity,
while TRAIL treatment of particle-functionalized cells induced
over a 4.5-fold increase in caspase-8 activity in the presence of
fluid
shear
stress
as
compared
with
controls
(Fig.
4f).
These results suggest that polymeric particles amplify TRAIL-
mediated apoptosis in the presence of shear forces via increased
caspase-8 activity.
To
assess
whether
mechanical
amplification
of
TRAIL-
mediated apoptosis alters death receptor (DR4, DR5) expression
on the cell surface, we measured receptor expression of particle-
functionalized tumour cells after exposure to TRAIL and fluid
shear stress via flow cytometry. TRAIL binding to DR4 and DR5
on the tumour cell surface engages the caspase signalling cascade
and triggers apoptosis41. In addition, TRAIL treatment alone
increases death receptor expression in malignant epithelial cells in
a process mediated by nuclear factor-kB activation42. Therefore,
increased DR4 and DR5 expression on particle-functionalized
tumour cells in the presence of shear could explain increased
TRAIL-mediated apoptosis due of increased receptor–ligand
interactions and subsequent apoptotic signalling. Indeed, flow
cytometry analysis showed increased death receptor expression
on
TRAIL-treated,
particle-functionalized
tumour
cells
in
the presence of fluid shear stress (Fig. 4g). Shear stress
exposure in the absence of TRAIL did not have an effect on
death receptor expression, consistent with previous work25.
Thus,
our
data
suggest
that
mechanical
amplification
of
TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis
using
polymeric

 TRAIL could be because of increased compressive forces
exerted by particles conjugated to the tumour cell surface in the
presence of fluid shear stress. Such forces act to flatten the
biologically inert glycocalyx expressed on the surface of cells, and
the physics of force-induced flattening and penetration of cell
glycocalyx
have
been
shown
to
facilitate
receptor–ligand
interactions43,44. Given that the glycocalyx is overexpressed on
many tumour cell types, increased compressive forces and
glycocalyx flattening can potentially increase TRAIL–death
receptor
interactions,
thus
increasing
both
death
receptor
expression and apoptosis.

injected
systemically into the tail vein of nu/nu mice, followed 15 min later
by an injection of EpCAM-targeted, PEG-functionalized PLGA
particles (Fig. 5a). Given that EpCAM is expressed on tumour
cells of epithelial origin with negligible expression on blood cells
in the vascular microenvironment, this particle platform enables
targeting of EpCAM þ tumour cells in the vasculature. At 30 min
post particle treatment, mice were treated with soluble TRAIL via
systemic administration (Fig. 5a), enabling the therapeutic to
interact with particle-functionalized tumour cells under in vivo
fluid shear stress exposure. Viable tumour cells in the blood-
stream were measured by collecting 200 ml blood samples from
mice 90 min post injection via submandibular bleeding (Fig. 5a).
Flow cytometry analysis showed a significant decrease in the
number of targeted particle-bound tumour cells subsequently
treated with soluble TRAIL in the circulation as compared with
control mice (Fig. 5b). Using flow cytometry, we measured
B40,000 tumour cells per ml of blood for mice injected with
tumour cells alone, and mice injected with tumour cells followed

 tumour cells in the circulation, annexin-V analysis showed that
B65% of the particle-bound tumour cell population in circula-
tion was apoptotic after TRAIL treatment, whereas B45% of the
tumour cell population treated with TRAIL in the absence of
particles were apoptotic (Supplementary Fig. 14). Given that
tumour cells administered via tail vein injection can lodge within
the vasculature 42 h post injection45, we utilized whole-body
bioluminescence imaging (BLI) to track the remaining tumour
cell burden 7 and 14 days post injection (Fig. 5a). Tumour cell
burden was readily apparent within control nu/nu mice treated
with tumour cells 7 days post injection, along with tumour cells
treated with targeted or nontargeted particles in the absence of
TRAIL treatment (Fig. 5d). Administration of soluble TRAIL
alone reduced the number of tumour cells in vivo, as measured
via BLI imaging (Fig. 5d). The apoptotic effect of soluble TRAIL
on tumour cells was significantly increased in vivo after
pretreatment with EpCAM-targeted particles, as BLI signals
were significantly reduced 7 days post injection. Quantitative
analysis showed a 490% reduction in BLI signal for tumour
cells

In addition to tumour cells in the circulation, we assessed
whether our approach could amplify TRAIL-mediated apoptosis
in solid tumour models, where tumour cells are exposed to a
variety of physical forces including blood flow from leaky tumour
vasculature, interstitial flows between blood and lymphatic
circulation as well as interstitial fluid pressures generated within
solid tumours10,46–48. Using a prostate cancer, EpCAM þ PC-3
xenograft model, we first confirmed that EpCAM-targeted PLGA
particles localized within the tumour 3 h post injection using
in
vivo
fluorescence
imaging
(Supplementary
Fig.
15a).
Harvesting of mouse organs showed that particles mainly
accumulated within the tumour and liver, with some particle
clearance to the kidneys (Supplementary Fig. 15b). Over a 21-day
treatment period, we measured a significant decrease in PC-3
tumour growth in mice treated with targeted particles followed by
TRAIL administration (3 h post particle injection), compared
with TRAIL treatment alone (Fig. 5f). Given the benefits of
combining TRAIL with natural products to enhance tumour cell
apoptosis in vitro in our current study (Fig. 2e), along with results
by others22, we assessed whether administration of the natural
product resveratrol could combine with our approach to further
increase TRAIL-mediated tumour apoptosis in vivo. Resveratrol is
a naturally occurring polyphenol that exhibits numerous health
benefits including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antitumour
activities, and has previously been shown to increase TRAIL-
mediated apoptosis in solid tumours49. In combination with
resveratrol, amplification of TRAIL apoptosis using our particle-
based approach reduced tumour growth by over 80% compared
with control mice (Fig. 5f). These combined results suggest that
the targeted polymeric particles can be utilized to mechanically
amplify TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in solid tumour models, and
can be combined with natural products to further reduce tumour
growth.
Toxicity results showed that treated mice exhibited no evidence
of elevated liver enzymes in serum (Fig. 6a,b), no significant
differences in haematocrit relative to untreated mice (Fig. 6c), no
loss of appetite or body weight or behavioural distress compared
with untreated mice (Fig. 6d) and no enlarged kidney mass
(Fig. 6e). It is important to note that the TRAIL dosage used to
target tumour cells in the bloodstream is approximately two
orders of magnitude less than the concentrations shown to be well
tolerated in previous animal and human trials with soluble
TRAIL22.
Collectively,
these
results
suggest
that
targeted
polymeric particles delivered and bound to tumour cells in vivo
can leverage physical forces to increase the apoptotic effect of
TRAIL, with negligible off-target toxicity.
Discussion
In summary, we have demonstrated that functionalization of the
tumour cell surface with polymeric particles can amplify TRAIL-
mediated tumour cell killing in the presence of fluid shear stress
both in vitro and in vivo in mice. Building upon our initial finding
that tumour cells, but not normal cells, show increased sensitivity
to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis under fluid shear stress conditions
of
the
circulation,
we
found
that
both
degradable
and
nondegradable particles functionalized to the tumour cell surface
act as mechanical amplifiers of this response. This approach
reduced the viability of TRAIL-resistant tumour cells when
treated with the ligand, and further increased tumour cell killing
in combination with the natural product piperlongumine. Similar
functionalization did not have toxic effects on normal human
leukocytes and human endothelial cell monolayers. Tumour cells
exhibited increased TRAIL-mediated apoptosis proportional to
higher shear stress in a manner that was not recapitulated with
doxorubicin treatment, indicating that this response is receptor-
mediated apoptosis specific. Furthermore, functionalization of
tumour cells with increased number and size of polymeric
particles
enhanced
TRAIL-mediated
apoptosis under

conditions, but not static conditions, suggesting that increased

 force exerted on the cell membrane enhanced the apoptotic effect.
Mechanical amplification of tumour cell killing was dependent on
caspase signalling and enhanced TRAIL death receptor expres-
sion on the tumour cell surface, suggesting that forces exerted by
polymeric particles increased the therapeutic effect of TRAIL.
Under varying physical forces exhibited in vivo, treatment of
tumour cells with an EpCAM-targeted PLGA particle platform
enhanced a subsequent injection of soluble TRAIL delivered via
the circulation, and reduced both circulating tumour cells in
blood and overall tumour cell burden by over 90%. In a PC-3
xenograft model, a significant decrease in tumour growth was
observed in mice treated with particles followed by TRAIL,
compared with TRAIL treatment alone. In combination with the
natural product resveratrol, administration of targeted particles
followed by TRAIL reduced tumour growth by 80% compared
with controls. It is important to note that the half-life of TRAIL is
a major obstacle to the clinical application of the ligand, which
was measured to be o30 min in animal studies50. However,
recent advances via conjugation with PEG, human serum
albumin and lipid nanoparticles have vastly improved the
pharmacokinetic profile of TRAIL51–54. Given the promising
results shown in this study with unmodified soluble TRAIL, we
envision that our approach can be combined with engineered
TRAIL nanoparticles and conjugates to show increased efficacy.
These results highlight a potential new role for polymeric
nanomaterials, traditionally used as drug delivery vehicles, as
amplifiers of receptor-mediated signalling and function in the
presence of physical forces. Based on this collective evidence, a
broad range of micro- and nanotechnology platforms can
potentially be applied to enhance receptor–ligand interactions
and signalling.

1-Step Polymorphs human cell separation media (Accurate Chemical & Scientific
Corporation, Westbury, NY, USA), and leukocytes were isolated from blood
via centrifugation at 480 � g for 50 min at 23 �C in a Marathon 8K centrifuge
(Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA). Leukocytes were extracted and washed
in Ca2 þ and Mg2 þ-free Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), and all remaining
red blood cells in the suspension were lysed hypotonically. Leukocytes were
resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 � 106 cells per ml in HBSS containing
0.5% human serum albumin, 2 mM Ca2 þ, 1 mM Mg2 þ and 10 mM HEPES
(Invitrogen), buffered to pH 7.4, before functionalization with particles. For
all leukocyte experiments, 495% viability was assessed using a Trypan blue
exclusion dye.
Endothelial cell and HT29 tumour cell monolayer growth. Endothelial cell (EC)
and HT29 tumour cell monolayers were grown on circular glass coverslips before
functionalization with particles55,56. Then, 40 mm diameter circular glass coverslips
(Thermo Scientific) were plasma treated (Harrick Plasma Cleaner) for 2 min and
subsequently incubated in 1% polyethylenemine at room temperature (RT) for
10 min. Coverslips were then washed in deionized water three times and treated
with 0.1% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at RT for 30 min. Coverslips
were washed in deionized water three times, dried and treated with 0.1 mg ml � 1
type I rat-tail collagen (Becton Dickinson) in HEPES (pH 8.0; Sigma-Aldrich)
for 2 h at 4 �C. Coverslips were placed in Petri dishes (60 mm � 15 mm; Sigma-
Aldrich), washed three times in PBS and briefly sterilized via ultraviolet exposure
for 15 min. HUVECs were plated on coverslips, at a density of 500,000 cells per
coverslip, in Medium 200 supplemented with low-serum growth supplement
(Cascade Biologics), 5% FBS (Invitrogen) and 100 U ml � 1 PenStrep. HT29 cells
were plated at a density of 500,00 cells per coverslip in McCoy’s 5A modified
medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS and 1% (vol/vol) Penstrep. Both cell
types were cultured for B4 days on coverslips before functionalization with
particles.
Polymeric particle conjugation to normal and tumour cells. Mononuclear
leukocytes, PC-3 and COLO 205 tumour cells were washed in Mg2 þ and Ca2 þ-
free HBSS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by treatment with trypsin-
EDTA for 5–10 min at 37 �C before handling. EC and HT29 monolayers, in
addition to tumour cells and leukocytes, were treated with NHS–PEG–biotin
at a concentration of 1 mM for 30 min at RT, washed and treated with streptavidin-
functionalized PS particles at a ratio of 1:480 particles per cell. Samples were
subjected to rocking at 4 �C for 1 h, and washed before use in assays. For biode-
gradable particle functionalization used for in vitro and in vivo assays, 10 mg of
PLGA-COOH particles (Phosphorex; diameter: 500 nm) were resuspended in
0.2 ml 50 mM MES buffer (pH 5.2), vortexed and treated with 0.02 ml EDAC
solution (concentration: 200 mg ml � 1). Then, 0.5 mg of maleimide-PEG-NH2 was
added to the particle solution and gently mixed at RT for 4 h. Particle solution was
washed three times, followed by overnight incubation and gentle mixing with
0.5 mg of a thiolated anti-EpCAM)antibody. Anti-EpCAM was thiolated using
1 mM Traut’s reagent following a protocol supplied by the manufacturer. Excess
Traut’s reagent was removed using a desalting column. Particles were subsequently
washed via centrifugation and resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. For
in vitro assays, cells treated with PLGA particles were subjected to rocking at 4 �C
for 1 h, and washed before use in assays.
To determine particle internalization, tumour cells were functionalized with
0.5 mM fluorescent Fluoresbrite YG (yellow–green; lex, 445 nm; lem, 500 nm)
PS particles and subsequently washed with a 0.4 % (w/v) Trypan blue solution57
to quench extracellular fluorescence. The percentage of cells with internalized
particles was assessed using confocal microscopy. To determine the role of PEG
linkers in mediating stable conjugation of particles to the tumour cell surface, cells
were treated with and without PEG linkers and subsequently treated with
fluorescent PS particles (ratio: 120 particles per cell). Cells were then washed three
times in PBS at 300 � g for 5 min and subsequently treated with an anti-EpCAM
antibody for 45 min at 4 �C. Cells were then washed in PBS and fluorescent
particle functionalization to EpCAM þ cells was determined using a BD
fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) Canto (BD Biosciences, San Jose,
CA, USA).
To quantify unbound particles post functionalization, cell samples were
centrifuged and the supernatant containing unbound fluorescent particles was
collected. Supernatant fluorescence was quantified using a fluorescent plate reader,
and was then compared with cell supernatant in the absence of particles, as well as
a fluorescent particle sample as a positive control (Supplementary Fig. 4). The
fluorescence distribution of cells functionalized with particles was measured using
flow cytometry.
In vitro fluid shear stress assays. Functionalized and nonfunctionalized tumour
cells, leukocytes and EC or HT29 monolayers were exposed to fluid shear stress
using a cone-and-plate viscometer (Brookfield, Middleboro, MA, USA) consisting
of a stationary plate underneath a rotating cone maintained at 37 �C by a circu-
lating water bath25. The cone-and-plate device design allows for a uniform shear
rate to be applied to cells58. The shear rate (G) does not depend on distance from
the centre of the cone, and is given by:
G ¼
o
tany
where o is the cone angular velocity (rad s � 1) and y is the cone angle (rad).
A laminar flow field is expected under all experimental conditions. For a
Newtonian fluid under these conditions, the shear stress, t , is proportional
to the shear rate being applied:
t ¼ mG
where m is the viscosity of the medium.
Before fluid shear stress exposure, the stationary plate and rotating cone were
washed thoroughly with 70% ethanol, followed by incubation with 5% BSA in
PBS to prevent nonspecific cell adhesion to the cone and plate surfaces. Tumour
cells and human leukocytes at a density of 0.5 � 106 cells per ml in serum-free
medium were treated with TRAIL and immediately exposed to fluid shear stress
(0.05–12.0 dyn cm � 2) in the viscometer. The shear stress range was chosen based
on its physiological relevance. High shear stress values (B30 dyn cm � 2) initially
investigated were not pursued further because of insufficient cell recovery
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Shear stress exposure times for COLO 205 and PC-3
tumour cells were 30 and 60 min, respectively. Effective TRAIL dosages and
incubation times to initiate the apoptotic process were verified using a caspase-8
activity assay, which showed increased caspase-8 activity in COLO 205 tumour
cells after incubation with TRAIL under static conditions for 30 and 60 min
(Supplementary Fig. 2). Coverslips coated with HUVEC or HT29 monolayers
were adhered to the plate of a cone-and-plate viscometer using vacuum grease
and were then exposure to fluid shear stress for 90 min and 6 h, respectively. For
combination therapies, TRAIL-resistant HT29 cells were treated simultaneously
with 0.1 mg ml � 1 TRAIL and 15 mM piperlongumine in the presence of shear
stress. After exposure to shear stress, cells were washed in PBS, resuspended in
culture medium, incubated overnight (B10 h) and assessed for cell viability using
a CellTiter-Glo luminescent viability assay. To assess the mode of cell death, cells
were washed in PBS after shear stress exposure, resuspended in culture medium,
incubated for 4 h and subsequently analysed for mode of cell death using an
annexin-V Apoptosis kit. For receptor expression assays, cells were labelled with
anti-human TRAIL DR4 and DR5 antibodies immediately after both TRAIL and
shear stress exposure, and assessed for DR4 and DR5 expression using flow
cytometry. For caspase inhibition studies, cells were treated with 50 mM of
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK or caspase
negative control inhibitor Z-FA-FMK (R&D Systems) for 4 h at 37 �C before
TRAIL treatment. For doxorubicin studies, cells were treated with doxorubicin
(concentration: 20 mM) for 2 h in the presence of shear stress. The doxorubicin
dosing regimen and incubation time was previously shown to induce apoptosis
in tumour cells59. After treatment, cells were washed thoroughly in PBS and
resuspended in culture medium for overnight incubation (12 h) before cell viability
analysis.
Brightfield and phase-contrast microscopy. Cell samples were washed and
placed into 24-well plates after treatment. Samples were incubated at 37 �C for
60 min to allow cells to adhere to the plate. Images were captured via brightfield
and phase-contrast microscopy using an EVOS microscope (Invitrogen, Grand
Island, NY, USA) to observe the presence of viable cells and membrane blebbing
that is characteristic of cellular apoptosis. Images were processed using ImageJ
software (US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Cell viability and apoptosis assays. A CellTiter-Glo solution was prepared using
the manufacturer’s protocol and was used to detach cells from the surface of the
plate. Equal volumes of CellTiter-Glo solution was added to each sample volume,
and sample aliquot triplicates were plated on black, flat bottom, chimney well
96-well plates (Greiner Bio-One, Monroe, NC, USA). Luminescence based on
ATP concentration was measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate reader
(Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). FITC- and APC-conjugated annexin-V
assays (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) were used to assess cell apoptosis and
necrosis. The manufacturer’s instructions were followed to prepare samples for
flow cytometric analysis. Viable cells were identified as being negative for both
annexin-V and PI, early apoptotic cells were positive for annexin-V only, late
apoptotic cells were positive for both annexin-V and PI and necrotic cells were
positive for PI only.
Caspase-8 activation assays. A caspase-8 fluorometric assay was prepared using
the manufacturer’s protocol (R&D Systems) and was used to detect caspase-8
activation in cell samples. Equal numbers of cells from all samples were lysed and
place into flat-bottom 96-well plates. Cell lysate was incubated with reaction buffer

 and caspase-8 fluorogenic substrate in a 1:1 volume ratio, and incubated at 37 �C
for 1 h. Caspase-8 activity was measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 Pro plate
reader using filters that allow light excitation at a wavelength of 400 nm and collect
emitted light at a wavelength of 505 nm.
In vivo COLO 205 tumour cell studies. Female nu/nu mice aged 16–20 weeks,
weighing 25–32 g, were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor,
ME, USA). Mice were restrained, and luciferase þ , GFP þ COLO 205 tumour
cells were injected via tail vein (2 � 106 cells in 50 ml) using a 30-guage needle
(Becton Dickson, Rutherford, NJ, USA). Mice were then injected with nontargeted
and EpCAM-targeted PLGA particles (500 nm diameter; B500 particles per
tumour cell) 15 min post tumour cell injection. At 30 min post particle injection,
mice were injected with 100 ml of saline or soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL; 1.5 mg ml � 1;
TRAIL plasma concentration B0.1 mg ml � 1) via tail vein using a 30-gauge needle.
Five mice were used in each group. All animal procedures were approved by the
MIT institutional animal care and use committee.
Analysis of tumour cells in bloodstream. Blood (B200 ml) was collected into
sodium heparin-coated tubes (Becton Dickinson) via submandibular bleed using a
sterile lancet (Medipoint, Mineola, NY, USA) 90 min post injection of TRAIL.
Circulating COLO 205 cells were separated from whole blood using Ficoll-Paque
PLUS (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) as per the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, blood samples were carefully layered over 1.5 ml of Ficoll and
centrifuged at 480 � g for 50 min at RT. After centrifugation, the buffy coat was
collected, washed in buffer containing Ca2 þ and cultured for 4–6 h in multiwell
plates in culture medium. GFP þ COLO 205 cells isolated from whole blood were
assessed using flow cytometry. To determine mode of cell death of tumour cells in
the blood stream, tumour cells were separated from whole blood, cultured for B2 h
in culture medium and labelled with an APC-conjugated annexin-V apoptosis kit
for flow cytometry analysis.
Whole-body BLI of tumour cell burden in mice. Whole-body BLI was performed
using an IVIS Spectrum-bioluminescent and fluorescent imaging system (Xenogen
Corporation, Waltham, MA, USA) consisting of CCD camera mounted in a light-
tight specimen box. Images were captured and BLI signals were quantified using
Living Image acquisition and analysis software (Xenogen). Anaesthetized mice
were placed in the IVIS Imaging System and images were captured from ventral
views 10–15 min after intraperitoneal injection of D-luciferin (150 mg kg � 1 body
weight). Successful tail vein injections of tumour cells were determined using
images showing systemic bioluminescence signal distributed throughout mice.
Mice with evidence of a satisfactory injection were used for further imaging time
points. Tumour cell signals within mice were monitored in vivo at 1 and 2 weeks
post injection.
PC-3 xenograft studies. Nu/nu mice (6 weeks, Charles River Laboratories) were
subcutaneously inoculated in the back with 3 � 106 PC-3 tumour cells. Mouse
tumour size was measured using a vernier caliper and tumour volume (V) was
calculated as V ¼ L � W2/2, where L and W were the length and width of the
tumour, respectively. Tumour-bearing mice were weighed and randomly divided
into six different groups of 5 mice per group when the tumour volume reached
100 mm3. The following treatment protocol was implemented over a 21-day period:
Group 1 (Control), vehicle control (0.1 ml PBS) administered through oral gavage 3
times per week starting at day 0, along with another vehicle control (0.1 ml PBS)
administered intravenously every 4 days, starting at day 1; Group 2 (Resveratrol),
resveratrol (30 mg kg � 1, in 0.1 ml PBS) administered through gavage 3 times per
week; Group 3 (TRAIL), soluble TRAIL (15 mg kg � 1 in 0.1 ml PBS) administered
intravenously every 4 days, starting at day 1; Group 4 (t-Particles-TRAIL),
EpCAM-targeted PLGA particles (size: 500 nm) administered intravenously
followed by soluble TRAIL (15 mg kg � 1 in 0.1 ml PBS) 3 h later, administered
intravenously every 4 days starting at day 1; Group 5 (TRAIL þ Resveratrol),
resveratrol administered through gavage, and TRAIL administered intravenously;
and Group 6 (t-Particles-TRAIL þ Resveratrol), resveratrol administered through
gavage, targeted particles administered intravenously followed by TRAIL 3 h later.
Mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions.
In vivo particle imaging study. EpCAM-targeted FITC-fluorescent PLGA
particles (size: 500 nm) were administered intravenously into nu/nu mice (dose:
40 mg kg � 1) when tumour volumes reached 200 mm3. PLGA particles are bio-
degradable and do not induce toxicity, as dosages as high as 500 mg kg � 1 have
previously been shown to not alter animal weight60. At 3 h post injection, particle
biodistribution was detected via in vivo fluorescence imaging using an IVIS
imaging system. After in vivo imaging, mice were killed. Tumours, spleen, kidneys,
lungs, heart and liver were then harvested and assessed for particle fluorescence via
ex vivo fluorescence imaging.
In vivo toxicity. Given that hepatocytes have shown sensitivity to TRAIL
at high dosages, serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), which indicate leakage from damaged hepatocytes
because of inflammation or apoptosis, were quantified to assess liver function in
treated mice. ALT and AST are normally stored within hepatocytes, and damage to
hepatocytes can induce elevated ALT and AST levels in serum. Serum levels of ALT
and AST were analysed using a colorimetric assay kit (BioVision). To quantify
potential changes in haematocrit, blood was drawn via cardiac puncture using a
28G heparin-coated syringe and collected in a heparinized tube. Two drops per
animal were placed in haematocrit tubes and spun for 2 min using a CritSpin
Microhematocrit Centrifuge. The ratio of red blood cells to total blood volume was
used to calculate haematocrit levels. All mice were weighed at least once per week
throughout the duration of the experiment. All organs were weighed upon
conclusion of the experiment.
Statistical analysis. All data sets were analysed using GraphPad Prism 5.0
(GraphPad software, San Diego, CA, USA) and Microsoft Excel (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA).
Data availability. All data and/or analysis tools that support the conclusions
of this study are available on request from the authors.
