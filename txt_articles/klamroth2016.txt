Background: rVIII-SingleChain, a novel recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII), has been designed as a B-domain
truncated construct with covalently bonded heavy and light chains, aiming to increase binding affinity to von
Willebrand
factor
(VWF).
Preclinical
studies
confirmed
greater
affinity
for
VWF,
giving
improved
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties compared with full-length rFVIII. Aim: To investigate the
pharmacokinetics of rVIII-SingleChain and compare them against those of full-length rFVIII. Methods: This
study enrolled 27 patients with severe haemophilia A in the AFFINITY clinical trial programme. After a 4-day
washout period, all patients received a single infusion of 50 IU kg�1 octocog alfa (Advate�); after a ≥4-day
postinfusion washout period, they received a single infusion of 50 IU kg�1 rVIII-SingleChain. Blood samples for
pharmacokinetic assessments of each product were collected before infusion (predose) and at 0.5, 1, 4, 8, 10, 24,
32, 48 and 72 h postinfusion for both products. Results: rVIII-SingleChain had a longer mean half-life (t1/2)
(14.5 vs. 13.3 h), lower mean clearance (CL) (2.64 vs. 3.68 mL h�1 kg�1), higher mean residence time (20.4 vs.
17.1 h) and larger mean AUCinf (2090 vs. 1550 IU·h dL�1) than octocog alfa, respectively. The mean AUCinf
after rVIII-SingleChain infusion was ~35% larger than after octocog alfa. A similar pattern was observed for
AUC0-last. No serious adverse events or inhibitors were reported. Conclusions: rVIII-SingleChain has a favourable
pharmacokinetic profile compared with octocog alfa and was well tolerated. The prolonged t1/2, larger AUC and
reduced CL of rVIII-SingleChain may permit longer dosing intervals, thereby improving patient adherence to
prophylactic treatment.

Introduction
The two most important complications of factor-
replacement
therapy in haemophilia
A today are
breakthrough bleeds during prophylaxis and the devel-
opment of inhibitors. Furthermore, frequent factor
VIII (FVIII) injections impact on the quality of life of
affected individuals and their adherence to treatment.
New recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) products have been

 developed
to
extend
the
half-life
(t1/2)
of
FVIII
through chemical modification (e.g. glycoPEGylation)
or fusion with Fc fragments [1,2]. Despite these
manipulations, the extension of rFVIII t1/2 has been
modest, limited to approximately 1.6-fold higher than
that of full-length rFVIII (FL-rFVIII) [3,4]. The t1/2
extension of the modified rFVIII seems to be depen-
dent upon the plasma t1/2 of von Willebrand factor
(VWF).
rVIII-SingleChain, a novel rFVIII, has been designed
as a B-domain truncated construct with covalently
bound heavy and light chains, aiming for a higher
binding affinity with VWF [5]. Preclinical studies con-
firmed a high affinity for VWF, with improved phar-
macokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic properties vs.
FL-rFVIII [6]. These studies indicated that exposure to
rVIII-SingleChain is greater than for FL-rFVIII at
equal doses, without the need for PEGylation or
fusion with other proteins. In vitro studies suggest
that, in addition to protecting FVIII from proteolysis,
VWF limits rFVIII recognition by antigen-presenting
cells, which may reduce the risk of inhibitor develop-
ment [7,8]. Further, preclinical studies have demon-
strated the efficacy and safety of this novel molecule
in mice, rabbits and non-human primates [9].
This PK investigation was part of an ongoing phase
I/III clinical study [10] within the AFFINITY clinical
trial programme. Here, we report the PK, safety and
tolerability of rVIII-SingleChain compared with FL-
rFVIII in 27 adult patients with severe haemophilia A.
Methods
Patients
This study recruited 27 male patients (18–65 years
old) with severe haemophilia A and ≥150 exposure
days to FVIII-containing products with no history of
inhibitors. After a 4-day washout period, all patients
received a single infusion of octocog alfa (Advate�,
Baxter Healthcare Corporation, CA, USA) at a dose
of 50 IU kg�1, based on the potency defined by the
US label. They then received a single infusion of
50 IU kg�1
rVIII-SingleChain
≥4 days
after
the
octocog alfa infusion. Blood samples for PK assess-
ments were collected before infusion (predose) and at
0.5, 1, 4, 8, 10, 24, 28, 48 and 72 h postinfusion for
each product. The 28-h postinfusion PK sampling was
included in the original protocol but was replaced
with PK sampling at 32 h, following a request from
the US Food and Drug Administration. Consequently,
the first three patients enrolled in the study had a
28-h sample collection; the remaining patients had a
32-h sample collection (Fig. 1). This study was per-
formed in accordance with the US Code of Federal
Regulations and International Conference on Harmon-
isation
Guidelines
on
Good
Clinical
Practice.
Approval
from
participating
institutional
review
boards and written informed consent from all patients
were obtained in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Chromogenic substrate assay
FVIII activity in plasma samples was determined with
a chromogenic assay, performed in CSL Behring’s
Central Laboratory (Marburg, Germany) using the
Coamatic� test kit (Chromogenix, Essen, Germany),
following the manufacturer’s instructions, using the
Behring
Coagulation
System
(Siemens
Healthcare
Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany). Separate methods
were used to determine the normal and low ranges of
FVIII activity [lower limit of quantification (LLOQ)
1 IU dL�1]; the principal differences were sample vol-
ume and the predilution ratio. Accuracy, precision,
repeatability, linearity, range and robustness were vali-
dated by predefined criteria. Reference curves were
prepared from standard human plasma (SHP) cali-
brated by the manufacturer against World Health
Organization (WHO) standard material for plasma.
Determination of FVIII inhibitors
FVIII inhibitors were assessed using the Nijmegen-
modified
Bethesda
assay
[11].

 Healthcare Diagnostics) were mixed and incubated for
2 h at 37°C. FVIII activity was then measured by a
one-stage
assay
using
Pathromtin�
SL
(Siemens
Healthcare Diagnostics, Marburg, Hesse, Germany).
Residual activity in the patient sample was calculated
and converted to Bethesda units using a theoretical
curve or mathematical function [12]. The assay was
validated
for
linearity,
LLOQ
and
robustness
in
human plasma samples and met predefined criteria.
Samples for FVIII inhibitor testing were taken at
screening and at 72 h postinfusion of rVIII-Single-
Chain.
Determination of antidrug antibodies against rVIII-
SingleChain
A
screening
assay
and
confirmatory
assays
were
employed to determine antidrug antibodies (ADAs) in
the
AFFINITY
clinical
trial
programme.
For
the
screening
assay,
a
direct-binding
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA)
was
performed
to
detect ADAs in clinical samples. If the screening assay
was above the cut-off, samples were retested using
two direct-binding ELISAs to confirm the specific anti-
body signal by identifying the immunoglobulin (Ig)
isotype (IgG or IgM). If the confirmatory assays were
negative, the screening result was considered a false
positive. If either confirmatory assay was positive, the
final result was reported as positive. Samples were
taken at screening, prior to rVIII-SingleChain adminis-
tration and at 72 h postinfusion of rVIII-SingleChain.
VWF antigen determination
For VWF antigen determination, a commercially avail-
able test kit purchased from Siemens Healthcare Diag-
nostics was used. A specific antibody to VWF was
bound
covalently
to
polystyrene
particles,
which
aggregated when mixed with samples containing VWF
antigen. VWF antigen was then measured turbidimet-
rically using the Behring Coagulation System device
(Siemens
Healthcare
Diagnostics)
and
calibrated
against SHP, which was calibrated against WHO stan-
dard 97/586 by the manufacturer.
PK assessment
A non-compartmental PK analysis of plasma FVIII
activity was performed for individual patient plasma
FVIII activity vs. time data using Model 202 for con-
stant infusion in WinNonlin� 6.3.0 (Phoenix Build
6.3.0.395, Pharsight Corp, St Louis, MO, USA), fol-
lowing octocog alfa and rVIII-SingleChain infusion.
Only central laboratory FVIII activities, quantified
using validated one-stage clotting and chromogenic
substrate assays, were used in the analysis. As FVIII is
an endogenous protein, this analysis was performed
with and without correction for baseline plasma FVIII
activity by subtracting immediate predose activity (de-
termined for each product specifically) from that
obtained at each timepoint.
Although
all
enrolled
patients
had
confirmed
endogenous FVIII levels of <1%, residual FVIII activi-
ties introduced from previous FVIII administrations
could have resulted in unexpectedly high predose
FVIII activity, potentially introducing baseline over-
correction bias, which would be most pronounced at
later timepoints. To minimize overcorrection bias, the
presented PK parameters derived from overall PK pro-
files [area under the plasma concentration vs. time
curve (AUC), t1/2, clearance (CL), volume of distribu-
tion at steady state (Vss) and mean residence time
(MRT)] should be interpreted using baseline-uncor-
rected values. PK parameters derived primarily from
early PK timepoints [maximum observed FVIII con-
centration (Cmax) and incremental recovery (IR)] are
best reflected by baseline-corrected values.
Actual sampling times, doses (according to the cor-
responding potency of specific lot numbers and injec-
tion volumes) and injection durations were used for
calculations of PK parameters: Cmax, time to Cmax,
t1/2, CL, Vss, AUC from time zero to last quantifiable
FVIII activity (AUC0-last), AUC from time zero extrap-
olated to infinity (AUCinf), MRT and IR.
rVIII-SingleChain potency was assigned using the
chromogenic substrate assay calibrated against the
WHO standard for FVIII concentrates. Octocog alfa
potency was adjusted based upon the chromogenic
substrate assay.
Safety assessment
Safety was assessed using the following variables:
• Development of inhibitors against FVIII
• Nature and incidence of adverse events
• Development
of
non-inhibitory
ADAs
against
rVIII-SingleChain
• Laboratory-based safety parameters (haematology
and biochemistry)
• Vital signs and physical examination
• Clinical signs of thrombosis
• Local tolerability as assessed by the investigator
using predefined criteria.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted by a Contract
Research Organization under the supervision of CSL
Behring. The CSL lead statistician for the AFFINITY
program was responsible for the statistical analyses. SAS
(Statistical Analyses System, Cary, NC, USA) software
was used. Baseline-uncorrected and -corrected analyses
were performed. PK parameters (log-transformed Cmax,
AUCs and CL) were compared using a paired t-test,

were
excluded, was performed on baseline-uncorrected data.
Results
FVIII activity-based PK parameters were calculated for
all 27 patients [all male; mean age 35.4 (range 19–60)
years]. Eleven patients were enrolled from Germany,
nine from the USA, four from Italy and three from
Austria. All patients were of Caucasian ethnicity
except for two who were of African American ethnic-
ity. Mean weight was 77.86 (range 59–100) kg and
mean body mass index was 24.71 (range 18.7–30)
kg m�2. All patients met the criteria for severe haemo-
philia A (historical FVIII activity levels <1%). Of the
27 subjects, 13 received on-demand therapy prior to
enrolment and 14 subjects were on routine prophylaxis
prior to study entry. No patient received treatment for
a bleed during the PK sampling period or experienced
any major protocol deviation that might interfere with
PK assessment; all patients were included in the PK
analysis.

(1.05–
6.18 IU dL�1) before rVIII-SingleChain dosing. After
rVIII-SingleChain administration, peak FVIII activities
were observed at the first PK sampling (0.5 h post-
dose).
Thereafter,
plasma
FVIII
activity
levels
decreased exponentially (Fig. 2). FVIII activities in
plasma after octocog alfa administration, also peaked
at the first PK sampling (0.5 h postdose), and declined
exponentially (Fig. 2). Of note, FVIII activities at 48 h
were >1% in all patients after rVIII-SingleChain dosing
while the activity levels in some (2 out of 27) were
<1% after octocog alfa dosing.

Baseline-uncorrected FVIII activity PK of rVIII-Single-
Chain vs. octocog alfa (after dose adjustment). rVIII-
SingleChain had a longer mean t1/2 (14.5 vs. 13.3 h;

(2.64
vs.
3.68 mL h�1 kg�1; P <0.0001), higher mean MRT
(20.4 vs. 17.1 h; P <0.0001) and larger mean AUCinf
(2090 vs. 1550 IU h dL�1; P <0.0001) than octocog
alfa (Table 1 and Fig. 3). Mean AUCinf after rVIII-
SingleChain dosing was approximately 35% higher
than after octocog alfa dosing. A similar pattern was
observed for AUC0-last.
As several patients had baseline FVIII activity >1%
(incomplete washout) before infusion, a sensitivity
analysis was performed with those patients excluded.
Differences between rVIII-SingleChain (n = 22) and
octocog alfa (n = 21) remained present in this analy-
sis. For example, CL (standard deviation) was 2.76
(0.88) vs. 4.02 (1.41) mL h�1 kg�1 for rVIII-Single-
Chain and octocog alfa, respectively; AUCinf (stan-
dard
deviation)
was

The
observed mean Cmax and IR of rVIII-SingleChain
(113 IU dL�1
and
2.24 IU dL�1 IU�1 kg�1,
respec-
tively) were comparable to those of octocog alfa
(116 IU dL�1
and
2.32 IU dL�1 IU�1 kg�1,
respec-
tively) (Table 1).
The baseline-corrected mean t1/2 of rVIII-Single-
Chain (14.0 h) was comparable to the baseline-uncor-
rected value, while the mean t1/2 of octocog alfa
decreased to 11.6 h with baseline correction (14.0 vs.
11.6 h; P = 0.0004). Similar to the baseline-uncor-
rected FVIII activity, rVIII-SingleChain continued to
have a lower mean CL (2.69 vs. 3.91 mL h�1 kg�1;
P <0.0001), higher mean MRT (19.6 vs. 15.5 h,

PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE OF rVIII-SINGLECHAIN

 depicted in Fig. 4. The majority of patients had an
increased
t1/2
following
rVIII-SingleChain
dosing
compared to octocog alfa.
An exploratory post hoc subanalysis of the PK data
(all 27 patients) compared both t1/2 and CL with
VWF antigen levels in individual patients. Both octo-
cog alfa and rVIII-SingleChain showed a positive cor-
relation between t1/2 and VWF antigen and a negative
correlation between CL and VWF antigen (Fig. 5).
Safety
No patient developed inhibitory antibodies against
FVIII or antibodies against rVIII-SingleChain by the
end of the study. Of the 27 patients, 26 entered the
treatment phase of the study and remained inhibitor/
ADA free.
No serious adverse events were reported. Adverse
events were recorded in one octocog alfa-treated
patient (back pain and musculoskeletal pain, mild and
moderate intensity, respectively, not considered to be
study drug-related) and two rVIII-SingleChain-treated
patients (toothache, mild intensity, not considered to
be study drug-related; generalized feeling of being hot,
mild intensity, considered to be study drug-related).
All events resolved. No vital sign abnormalities were
associated
with
rVIII-SingleChain
or
octocog
alfa
infusion.
There was one spontaneous bleeding event (haema-
turia) that became apparent during rVIII-SingleChain
treatment, which did not require additional treatment.
Another patient had a nasal bleed, lasting 15 min that
did not require treatment and resolved before octocog
alfa administration. No local reactions of erythema,
itching, pain, heat, measurable oedema or induration
were reported after administration of octocog alfa or
rVIII-SingleChain.
Discussion
rVIII-SingleChain demonstrated improved PK parame-
ters compared with octocog alfa, exhibiting lower CL,
longer
t1/2,
higher
MRT
and
larger
AUC.
At
50 IU kg�1, rVIII-SingleChain provided similar peak
FVIII activity (IR and Cmax), and approximately, 35%
higher AUC compared with octocog alfa. To minimize
overcorrection bias, AUC, CL, Vss, t1/2 and MRT have
been interpreted using baseline-uncorrected values.
Baseline-corrected values are more meaningful for
Cmax and IR and have therefore been used.
Intravenous administration of rVIII-SingleChain was
well tolerated in patients with severe haemophilia A.
No serious adverse events were observed and all
adverse events resolved. All adverse events were mild
to moderate, and typical for a population with severe
haemophilia A. One mild adverse event of a general-
ized feeling of being hot was considered to be related
to rVIII-SingleChain.
rVIII-SingleChain has been designed as a B-domain
truncated construct with covalently bonded heavy and
light chains, with the goal of achieving higher FVIII
affinity for its chaperone protein VWF. In vitro data
show rVIII-SingleChain has an approximately three-
fold higher affinity for VWF compared with FL-rFVIII
[6], and a greater affinity for VWF than that previ-
ously reported for either NovoEight� or human cell
line-derived rhFVIII [13]. This single-chain design is
unique
among
currently
marketed
and
developed
rFVIII products, which all have a two-chain structure.
The two-chain design is also more labile in the manu-
facturing environment and can result in inactive disso-
ciated FVIII chains being present in the final drug
product [14]. Indeed, the unique rVIII-SingleChain
design results in enhanced molecular stability and
improved structural integrity of the FVIII molecule.

Plot of individual half-life pharmacokinetic parameters following a single infusion of 50 IU kg�1 octocog alfa and rVIII-SingleChain for baseline-cor-
rected (left panel) and -uncorrected (right panel) FVIII activity profiles. Thin solid line represents within-patient change in t1/2 and dashed line represents
change in mean in t1/2 between treatment groups. Following rVIII-SingleChain, higher within-patient baseline-corrected t1/2 was estimated in 23 of 27
patients, and similarly higher within-patient-uncorrected t1/2 was estimated for 21 of 27 patients compared to octocog alfa. Inter-patient t1/2 variability for
octocog alfa (range: 3.6–4.4) and rVIII-SingleChain (range: 3.4–3.8) is summarized in Table 1 (t1/2, SD). FVIII, factor VIII; SD, standard deviation.

R. KLAMROTH et al.
 One specific class of technologies that have gener-
ated considerable interest within the haemophilia com-
munity are those for extending t1/2, with two products
having been approved and several new compounds
having completed or entering late-phase clinical trials.
In haemophilia B, fusion of factor IX to albumin or
Fc antibody fragments [15] results in a marked exten-
sion of plasma t1/2 [16]. Attempts to prolong the t1/2
of FVIII have been less successful, and FVIII plasma
t1/2 has yet to exceed that of VWF, which seems to
limit the survival of current FVIII constructs.
Although comparisons between data obtained from
different studies must be made cautiously, fusion of
FVIII with an Fc fragment extended the t1/2 of FVIII to
18.8 h
from
11.0 h
and
increased
the
AUC
to
2800 IU�h dL�1 from 1800 IU�h dL�1 at a dose of
65 IU kg�1 [17]. Two glycoPEGylated FVIIIs are in
development; at a dose of 25 IU kg�1, one has a mean
FVIII t1/2 and AUC of 15.8 h and 1474 IU�h dL�1,
respectively [3], while the other has a t1/2 and AUC of
18.2 h and 1577 IU�h dL�1 respectively [18]. A PEGy-
lated FVIII, BAX 855, has demonstrated a mean t1/2 of
14.3 h and AUC of 2073 IU�h dL�1 at a dose of
30 IU kg�1 [19]. Clinical experience with these new
FVIII products will show if the achieved modest
increases in t1/2 will translate into a benefit for patients,
offsetting the need for PEGylation or Fc fusion.
In this study, the t1/2 of rVIII-SingleChain was pro-
longed
to
14.5 h
and
the
AUC
increased
to
2090 IU�h dL�1 at a dose of 50 IU kg�1, without
requiring
major
molecular
modifications
such
as
fusion to antibody fragments or glycoPEGylation,
which may hypothetically alter biological function.
These differences remained after excluding data from
patients with high baseline FVIII activity levels.
Prophylactic dosing intervals for patients with hae-
mophilia A are largely driven by maintaining FVIII
activity >1% as the time spent with FVIII activity
below a trough of 1% increases the risk of serious
bleeding [20]. A recent study has reported that after
injection of 50 IU kg�1 rFVIIIFc, the time taken for
FVIII activity to fall to 1% was 4.9 days [4]; in line
with this observation, the estimated time to FVIII
activity of 1% was approximately 4.25 days after the
administration of rVIII-SingleChain.
While t1/2 calculations can be biased by blood sam-
ple timing, CL appears less affected and offers a more
robust parameter for comparison of the PK of FVIII
products. In a study comparing octocog alfa and N8�,
the
mean
weight-normalized
CLs
were
4.17 mL h�1 kg�1 and 4.11 mL h�1 kg�1 for octocog
alfa and N8� respectively [21]. Powell et al. [17]
reported a CL for octocog alfa of 3.61 mL h�1 kg�1
at 65 IU kg�1 and a CL of 2.32 mL kg�1 h�1 for
rFVIIIFc. In our study, the baseline-uncorrected CL
for rVIII-SingleChain was 2.64 mL h�1 kg�1 (baseline
corrected: 2.69 mL h�1 kg�1) and 3.68 mL h�1 kg�1
(baseline corrected: 3.91 mL h�1 kg�1) for octocog
alfa. Compared with octocog alfa, CL for rVIII-Single-
Chain was 28–31% lower. Accordingly, we observed

PHARMACOKINETIC PROFILE OF rVIII-SINGLECHAIN

 an approximate 35% increase in AUC for rVIII-Single-
Chain compared with octocog alfa.
Consistent with the protection against degradation
that VWF confers upon FVIII [22], the observed corre-
lations between VWF antigen levels and t1/2 and CL
of rVIII-SingleChain suggest that increased binding of
rVIII-SingleChain to VWF contributes to the improved
PK profile compared with octocog alfa. This hypothe-
sis is supported by noting that under physiologic con-
ditions, ~1% of FVIII molecules circulate freely while
the remaining 99% are VWF bound, but in patients
treated with rVIII-SingleChain, the VWF bound frac-
tion increases to 99.9% [6]. Binding of FVIII to VWF
also limits its recognition and uptake by antigen-pre-
senting cells, dose-dependently blocking endocytosis of
FVIII by monocyte-derived dendritic cells [23], giving
a potential mechanism for mitigating the risk of inhi-
bitor development [7,8]. This study suggests increased
affinity for VWF improves the PK of FVIII, and
although no patient developed inhibitors, long-term
clinical data, including data from previously untreated
patients, are required for establishing the effects of
increased VWF binding on immunogenicity.
The favourable PK parameters of rVIII-SingleChain
relative to octocog alfa suggest prophylactic rFVIII
treatment intervals could be extended, reducing treat-
ment burden and improving patient adherence. Cou-
pled with its high affinity for VWF and potentially
reduced
immunogenicity,
rVIII-SingleChain
could
address several unmet needs. Future studies will show
whether these properties translate into significant clini-
cal benefits.
