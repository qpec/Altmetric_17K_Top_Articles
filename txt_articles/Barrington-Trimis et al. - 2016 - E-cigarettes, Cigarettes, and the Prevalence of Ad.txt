abstract
BACKGROUND: Adolescent e-cigarette use has increased rapidly in recent years, but it is unclear 
whether e-cigarettes are merely substituting for cigarettes or whether e-cigarettes are 
being used by those who would not otherwise have smoked. To understand the role of 
e-cigarettes in overall tobacco product use, we examine prevalence rates from Southern 
California adolescents over 2 decades.
METHODS: The Children’s Health Study is a longitudinal study of cohorts reaching 12th 
grade in 1995, 1998, 2001, 2004, and 2014. Cohorts were enrolled from entire classrooms 
in schools in selected communities and followed prospectively through completion of 
secondary school. Analyses used data from grades 11 and 12 of each cohort (N = 5490).
RESULTS: Among 12th-grade students, the combined adjusted prevalence of current cigarette 
or e-cigarette use in 2014 was 13.7%. This was substantially greater than the 9.0% 
adjusted prevalence of current cigarette use in 2004, before e-cigarettes were available (P = 
.003) and only slightly less than the 14.7% adjusted prevalence of smoking in 2001 (P = .54). 
Similar patterns were observed for prevalence rates in 11th grade, for rates of ever use, 
and among both male and female adolescents and both Hispanic and Non-Hispanic White 
adolescents.
CONCLUSIONS: Smoking prevalence among Southern California adolescents has declined over 2 
decades, but the high prevalence of combined e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014, compared 
with historical Southern California smoking prevalence, suggests that e-cigarettes are 
not merely substituting for cigarettes and indicates that e-cigarette use is occurring in 
adolescents who would not otherwise have used tobacco products.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: E-cigarette 
use has increased rapidly in recent years among 
adolescents. It is unknown whether e-cigarettes 
are merely substituting for cigarettes or whether 
e-cigarettes are increasing total adolescent tobacco 
product use via initiation by those who would not 
otherwise have smoked.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: The high prevalence of 
combined e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014, 
compared with historical Southern California 
smoking prevalence, suggests that e-cigarette use is 
occurring in adolescents who would not otherwise 
have used tobacco products.

Since the introduction of electronic 
cigarettes into the US market in 
2007, 
 
1 adolescent use has increased 
rapidly, particularly in the past 
several years. Data from the National 
Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), a 
nationally representative cross-
sectional survey of adolescents in 
the United States, show that current 
(past 30-day) use of e-cigarettes 
increased exponentially from 1.1% 
in 2011 to 16.0% in 2015 among 
high school students. 
2 
 
– 
6 While the 
prevalence of e-cigarette use is 
increasing, cigarette use is generally 
declining among adolescents; in 
the NYTS, current cigarette use 
among high school students fell from 
15.8% in 2011 to 9.2% in 2014, 
 
2, 
 
3, 
 
5, 
6 
continuing the decline in prevalence 
of cigarette use among adolescents 
from its most recent peak in the 
mid-1990s when the prevalence 
of current smoking reached 35%. 
7 
Of note, the prevalence of cigarette 
smoking did not continue to decline 
from 2014 (9.2%) to 2015 (9.3%). 
6 
In 2014, current use of e-cigarettes 
surpassed current cigarette use for 
the first time in several national 
studies (including the NYTS 
2 and the 
Monitoring the Future Study 
8), as 
well as in a number of local and state-
level studies, 
9 
– 
11 including our study 
of Southern California adolescents. 
12
There are multiple interpretations 
of recent trends in e-cigarette and 
cigarette use among adolescents. 
Adolescents who otherwise 
would have smoked may be using 
e-cigarettes instead of cigarettes. 
Alternatively, e-cigarettes may be 
recruiting new users who otherwise 
would not have initiated cigarette 
use (or perhaps any other tobacco 
product) if e-cigarettes were not 
available. Recent data from the 2015 
NYTS found a small, nonsignificant 
increase in the use of any tobacco 
product from 2013 to 2015 (from 
22.9% to 25.3%). 
2, 
 
6 The increase in 
overall tobacco product use appears 
to be largely driven by increases in 
e-cigarette and hookah use in 2013 
and 2014, and continued increases 
in e-cigarette use in 2015, along with 
no decline in cigarette smoking from 
2014 to 2015. 
2, 
 
3 Although these data 
provide insight into trends over the 
preceding 3 years, adolescent tobacco 
use has declined for >20 years.7 The 
impact of e-cigarettes on adolescent 
tobacco use trends that have evolved 
over longer periods is unknown.
We analyzed data from the Southern 
California Children’s Health Study 
(CHS), a prospective study of 5 
cohorts reaching 12th grade in 1995, 
1998, 2001, 2004, and 2014, to 
describe patterns of smoking among 
adolescents across these years. 
On the basis of historical data on 
smoking initiation over the course 
of adolescence in these cohorts, 
we compared the rate of total 
e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 
to the rate of cigarette use in 2004 
before e-cigarettes were available; 
we hypothesized that an increase 
from this benchmark may indicate 
that e-cigarettes are currently being 
used by adolescents who would 
not otherwise have smoked if 
e-cigarettes were not available.
METHODS
Study Sample
The CHS is a prospective cohort 
study (1993–present), originally 
designed to study the effects of 
childhood air pollution exposure. 
13 
– 
15 
It comprises 5 cohorts of adolescents 
(Cohorts A–E) who were recruited 
and followed through 12th grade 
( 
Table 1). Recruitment methods 
and data collection procedures have 
been described previously.12 
 
– 
15 
Briefly, participants were enrolled 
from entire classrooms in schools in 
selected communities in Southern 
California 
12, 
14 in 10th grade (Cohort 
A, 1993), seventh grade (Cohort B, 
1993), fourth grade (Cohort C, 1993 
and Cohort D, 1996), kindergarten 
(Cohort E1, 2003), or first grade 
(Cohort E2, 2003). The current 
analysis uses available data from 
grades 11 and 12 of each cohort 
from participants who answered 
questions about tobacco product 
use (N = 5490; 11th grade: mean age 
[SD] = 16.9 [0.4]; 12th grade: mean 
age [SD] = 17.9 [0.4]. In Cohorts A 
through D, history of cigarette use 
was collected by in-person interview 
every year at schools as they were 
followed over time. 
15, 
 
16 Among 
participants in Cohorts A through D 
with data available from 11th or 12th 
grade, 85.7% of the sample provided 
information on smoking history 
in both 11th and 12th grades and 
therefore contributed to prevalence 
estimates in both years; 10.6% 
contributed to 11th grade analyses 
only and 3.7% contributed to 12th 
grade analyses only. In Cohorts 
E1 and E2, who were separated 
by 1 grade, smoking history was 
collected every other year, so both 
11th- and 12th-grade subjects were 
included in the 2014 survey. In 
2014, smoking history in Cohorts 
E1 and E2 was collected by self-
administered questionnaires under 
study staff supervision. Cohort A 
through D subjects were all recruited 
from the same 12 communities; 
Cohorts E1 and E2 were recruited 
from 13 communities, of which 
12 participated in the 2014 data 
collection and 8 were the same as 
Cohorts A through D.
Ethics Statement
The study was approved by the 
University of Southern California 
Institutional Review Board. Written 
informed consent was obtained 
before data collection.
Cigarette and E-Cigarette Use
In all CHS cohorts, participants were 
asked the number of cigarettes 
or packs of cigarettes that they 
had smoked in the past 24 hours, 
past week, past month, past year, 
and in their lifetime. In each year, 
participants were classified as 
current users if they reported 
smoking ≥1 cigarettes in the past

24 hours, past week, or past month; 
participants were classified as ever 
users if they reported either (1) use 
in the past year or in their lifetime or 
(2) listed an age at which they had 
first smoked. This classification was 
used for all prevalence estimates of 
cigarette use alone, across all cohorts.
In 2014, smoking history was 
assessed in Cohort E participants (in 
grades 11 and 12) using the same 
question as in Cohorts A through D, 
along with 2 additional questions that 
asked about the age at which each 
participant had first used a cigarette 
(“even 1 or 2 puffs”) and the number 
of days smoked in the past 30 days. 
In addition, use of e-cigarettes was 
assessed for the first time using the 
new questions. Adolescents who 
had used cigarettes or e-cigarettes 
on at least 1 of the past 30 days 
were classified as “current users” 
of that product. “Ever users” were 
adolescents who reported having 
ever tried a product. Analyses 
evaluating combined product use 
of cigarettes or e-cigarettes in 
Cohorts E1 and E2 were based on 
responses to the new questions. The 
prevalence rates both for current 
and ever cigarette use were quite 
similar using either set of questions, 
differing by 0.1% for current use and 
1.6% for prevalence of ever smoking, 
and the results of analyses were 
not substantively different using 
either set of questions. Therefore, 
in Cohort E we used the prevalence 
rates derived from the new questions 
about cigarette use, which we have 
reported previously 
12 and which 
were common to those used to assess 
e-cigarette prevalence rates.
Statistical Analysis
Prevalence estimates for ever and 
current cigarette use were calculated 
by cohort and grade, using the 
questionnaire items assessed across 
all cohorts. In Cohort E (in 2014), we 
calculated the combined prevalence 
of cigarette or e-cigarette use (ever or 
current), which included adolescents 
who reported use of either product 
or dual use of both products. Logistic 
regression models were used to 
estimate smoking prevalence for each 
cohort by grade, with adjustment 
for self-reported sex, ethnicity 
(Hispanic, non-Hispanic white, or 
other), and parental education (less 
than high school education, high 
school graduate, some college, college 
degree, some graduate school or 
higher, unknown/missing). Adjusted 
models were used to account for the 
different distribution across cohorts 
of socioeconomic factors known to be 
associated with cigarette use. These 
models were applied separately to 
current smoking and ever smoking. 
The distributions of sex, ethnicity, 
and parental education in Cohort 
E were used as the reference for 
calculating the adjusted prevalence 
estimates from the logistic model. 
Logistic regression models were 
also used to evaluate trends in the 
prevalence of cigarette use (ever 
or current) over calendar time, by 
including year of data collection 
as a continuous predictor variable 
in separate analyses by grade. 
Logistic regression models with 
an interaction term were used to 
evaluate whether the pattern of 
cigarette use across cohorts varied 
by ethnicity or sex. In analyses to 
assess the sensitivity of results to the 
participation of different Southern 
California communities in different 
cohorts, we additionally restricted 
analyses to the 8 communities 
common to all years of all cohorts 
and adjusted for community. The 
Statistical Analysis System (SAS, 
version 9.4) was used for analyses, 
and figures were created using Stata, 
version 13.1. All hypothesis testing 
was conducted assuming a .05 
significance level.

Demographic characteristics for 
each cohort are shown in

greater proportion of non-Hispanic 
white adolescents (54%–59%), 
whereas Cohorts E1 and E2 included 
more Hispanic adolescents (49%–
53%). The distributions of the 
highest level of parental education 
differed among the cohorts.
The adjusted prevalence of current 
smoking among high school students 
decreased over time from 1995 to 
2014 in both 11th and 12th grades 
(Ptrend < .0001;  
Fig 1 A and B). Among 
12th-grade students in Cohort A 
(1995), the adjusted prevalence 
of current smoking was 19.1%; 
prevalence of use decreased to 
17.1% in Cohort B (1998), 14.7% 
in Cohort C (2001), 9.0% in Cohort 
D (2004), and 7.8% in Cohort E 
(2014). Although the prevalence of 
current cigarette use was lowest 
among students in both grades in 
2014, the combined prevalence of 
current cigarette and/or e-cigarette 
use was similar to or greater than 
that for cigarette use alone 10 to 
15 years ago, before e-cigarettes 
were available ( 
Fig 1 A and B). For 
example, among 12th-grade students, 
the adjusted prevalence of combined 
use of either product in 2014 was 
13.7% (3.8% dual users of cigarettes 
and e-cigarettes, 3.9% cigarette 
only users, and 6.0% e-cigarette 
only users), which was similar to 
the 14.7% prevalence of cigarette 
use in 2001 (P = .54), and nearly 
5 percentage points higher than 
the adjusted prevalence of current 
cigarette use in 2004 (9.0%; P = 
.003).
The prevalence of ever cigarette 
use followed similar patterns of an 
overall decrease over time across 
Cohort A (1994–1995) to Cohort E 
(2014) for both 11th- and 12th-grade 
students (Ptrend < .0001;  
Fig 1 C 
and D). However, the 11th- and 
12th-grade prevalence rates for 
ever cigarette use in 2014 were not 
statistically significantly lower than 
the prevalence in Cohort D 10 years 
earlier in 2003–2004 (P = .59, 0.56, 
respectively). The prevalence of

combined ever use of cigarettes or 
e-cigarettes also surpassed rates of 
ever cigarette use more than a decade 
ago. Among 12th-grade students, the 
adjusted prevalence of ever use of 
either cigarettes or e-cigarettes in 
2014 was 32.1%, substantially higher 
than the adjusted prevalence of ever 
cigarette use in 2004 (20.4%; P < 
.0001), and slightly higher than the 
adjusted prevalence in 2001 (30.2%; 
P = .41).
Among both male and female 
adolescents, the prevalence of 
cigarette or e-cigarette use (ever 
or current) in both 11th and 12th 
grades in 2014 was higher than the 
prevalence of smoking in 2003–2004 
and was generally similar to the 
prevalence of smoking in 2000–2001 
( 
Fig 2 A–D). There was no difference 
between sexes in these patterns 
of decline in smoking over time 
(interaction P > .05). The prevalence 
of current and ever use of cigarettes 
within cohorts was higher among 
male than among female adolescents, 
with more pronounced differences 
observed among 12th-grade 
students; combined rates of 
e-cigarette or cigarette use in 2014 
were also larger in male than female 
adolescents.
The prevalence of current and ever 
smoking also decreased over time 
from 1994 to 2014 among both 
non-Hispanic white adolescents and 
Hispanic adolescents (P < .0001;  
Fig 
3 A–D; interaction P for ethnicity 
>.05). In both ethnic groups, the 
combined prevalence of current 
cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 
exceeded the rate of current cigarette 
use in 2003 (11th grade) or 2004 
(12th grade). For example, among 
non-Hispanic white 12th-grade 
students, the combined rate of 
current cigarette or e-cigarette use 
in 2014 in Cohort E was identical to 
the rate of smoking in 2001 (17.2%;

5.0% dual use, 4.4% cigarette only 
use, 7.8% e-cigarette only use); the 
rate of combined use among Hispanic 
white adolescents in 2014 (12.0%; 
2.9% dual use, 5.0% cigarette only 
use, 4.1% e-cigarette only use) was 
>3 percentage points higher than 
the rate of smoking in 2004 (8.8%) 
and only slightly less than the rate 
of smoking in 2001 (13.8%). Similar 
patterns were observed for ever use 
in both ethnicities; the combined rate 
of cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 
in 11th- and 12th-grade students 
was higher than the rates of smoking 
10 years earlier in both ethnic 
groups. We did observe differences 
in rates of smoking within cohorts 
between Hispanic and non-Hispanic 
white study participants. Current 
smoking prevalence was consistently 
higher among non-Hispanic white 
adolescents than among Hispanic 
white adolescents ( 
Fig 3 A and B), 
but ever use was generally similar 
or modestly higher among Hispanic 
white adolescents than among non-
Hispanic white adolescents ( 
Fig 
3 C and D). In 2014 the combined 
prevalence of e-cigarette or cigarette 
use (both current and ever) was 
greater in Hispanic whites than 
non-Hispanic whites in 11th grade, 
which appears to result from higher 
prevalence of cigarette only use 
(dual and e-cigarette only use was 
similar across both groups). In 12th 
grade, the combined prevalence 
of e-cigarette or cigarette use was 
greater in non-Hispanic whites 
than Hispanic white youth, largely 
resulting from greater levels of 
e-cigarette and dual product use.
In analyses restricted to the 8 
communities with data available 
across all cohorts, trends in 
prevalence across cohorts and across 
grades within cohorts, as well as the 
ethnic- and sex-specific patterns, 
were similar to those observed in the 
entire sample (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
These Southern California 
communities have experienced 
a marked decrease in adolescent 
cigarette use over the past 2 
decades. However, among both 
11th- and 12th-grade students, the 
combined prevalence of current 
cigarette or e-cigarette use in 2014 
was substantially greater than the 
prevalence of smoking in 2004 
(among 12th graders, eg, 13.7% 
and 9.0%, respectively) and was 
almost as high as the prevalence of 
smoking in 2001 (14.7% for 12th 
graders).
This substantially increased 
combined prevalence of cigarette 
smoking or e-cigarette use in 2014, 
compared with smoking rates a 
decade earlier, when e-cigarettes 
were not available, suggests that 
e-cigarettes are not used only by 
adolescents who would otherwise be 
smoking cigarettes. If, for example, 
the current rates of smoking would 
not have changed from 2004 to 2014 
in the absence of e-cigarettes, then 
1.2% of adolescents in Southern 
California, the difference between 
the 7.8% adjusted prevalence of 
cigarette use in 2014 and 9.0% 
in 2004, may be substituting 
e-cigarettes for cigarettes. An 
additional 4.7% of e-cigarette users, 
the difference between the 13.7% 
combined prevalence of e-cigarette 
or cigarette use in 2014 and the 
9.0% prevalence of cigarette use 
in 2004 likely would not have used 
cigarettes if e-cigarettes were not 
available, under the assumption 
that the rate of smoking from 2004 
to 2014 would not have changed. 
The assumption that smoking rates 
would not have decreased in the 
absence of e-cigarettes likely makes 
this estimate of the proportion of

e-cigarette users who would not 
otherwise have used cigarettes 
conservative.
The general prevalence patterns 
and the findings compared with 
the 2004 data were similar among 
Hispanic and non-Hispanic white 
participants and in male and female 
participants; thus, tobacco control 
interventions geared toward youth 
are equally needed for youth of 
both sexes and ethnicities. The 
prevalence of cigarette use or 
combined use (Cohort E only) did 
differ by gender and ethnicity within 
each cohort. Hispanic adolescents 
were less likely to report cigarette 
use in each cohort among both 
11th- and 12th-grade students but 
as likely to report ever use, a pattern 
consistent with historically reported 
ethnic comparisons. 
3, 
 
7, 
 
17, 
 
18 Male 
respondents were generally more 
likely to report use of cigarettes, 
e-cigarettes, or combined use of 
cigarettes or e-cigarettes, which 
is also consistent with previous 
literature.2, 
 
7, 
 
12, 
 
19
A major strength of this study is the 
use of >20 years of data collected 
across 5 cohorts drawn from the 
same CHS communities to assess 
patterns of change in cigarette use 
in Southern California. Because all 
results were adjusted for the Cohort 
E distribution of race/ethnicity, sex, 
and parental education, it is unlikely 
that differences across cohorts 
were influenced by changes in 
sociodemographic characteristics of 
the population over time. The study 
is also subject to some limitations. 
Data on use of tobacco products 
other than cigarettes were not 
collected from earlier cohorts. Thus, 
the contribution of hookah, cigar/
cigarillo, pipe, or smokeless tobacco 
use to the prevalence of all tobacco 
product use in earlier cohorts is not 
known. Data from the NYTS have 
shown relatively stable prevalence of 
use of cigars and smokeless tobacco 
from 2000 to 2012, 
 
20 followed by 
a decrease in cigar and pipe use 
and in smokeless tobacco use from 
2011 to 2014. 
2 Although national 
results may not be generalizable to 
Southern California (and vice versa), 
we cannot exclude the possibility 
that e-cigarette use is substituting 
for these combustible tobacco 
products. No data are available on 
trends in hookah use across the 
periods of interest in this study, but 
prevalence of hookah use increased 
in the NYTS from 2011 to 2014, 
 
2 so 
it seems unlikely that the increase in 
prevalence of e-cigarette use during 
this period reflects substitution of 
e-cigarettes for hookah use among 
participants who otherwise would 
have smoked hookah use in previous 
cohorts. Analyses were restricted 
to Hispanic youth (historically an 
underrepresented population in 
tobacco regulatory science research) 
and non-Hispanic white youth, 
who comprise the majority of the 
Southern California population; the 
prevalence estimates were imprecise 
in other racial/ethnic groups in 
our study, which made up <20% of 
the sample. Additional research is 
needed to determine whether similar 
patterns of product use over time 
occurred in other racial groups and in 
other geographic regions.
E-cigarettes have gained popularity 
in recent years, in part because 
of availability in a wide variety of 
flavorings 
21 that may be appealing to 
adolescents and young adults, 
 
22 
the perception that e-cigarettes 
are less harmful than smoking, 
 
23 
absence or poor enforcement of 
regulations on indoor use, 
 
24 and the 
recent popularity of product-specific 
venues that encourage use of these 
products in social situations, such as 
vape shops.25 Such characteristics 
of e-cigarettes may be recruiting 
new users who are deterred from 
initiating cigarettes because of 
concerns about the health hazards 
of smoking and social stigmatization 
of cigarette use. 
7 There is concern 
that the increasing prevalence of 
e-cigarette use could even lead 
to initiation of smoking among 
previously nonsmoking adolescent 
e-cigarette users in what has been 
described as a “gateway effect, 
” either 
as a result of social normalization of 
alternative product use and smoking 
behaviors more generally, leading 
to renormalization of smoking or by 
directly increasing use of cigarettes 
through establishment of reward 
seeking behaviors (eg, nicotine 
dependence). 
26 
 
– 
30 Although our 
results demonstrated a decline in 
cigarette use in the past decade, 
we also have observed a markedly 
increased likelihood of intention to 
use cigarettes 
31 among e-cigarette 
users in the CHS in 2014 who had 
never smoked, results which are 
consistent with 2 recent studies 
examining the association of 
e-cigarette use with susceptibility to 
smoking, 
 
28, 
 
30 and recent longitudinal 
studies that have found that never-
smoking e-cigarette users were more 
likely to report use of cigarettes a 
year later than never e-cigarette 
users.32 
– 
34
The use of e-cigarettes by 
nonsmoking adolescents poses 
several potential public health 
problems. First, use of e-cigarettes 
containing nicotine may directly 
contribute to nicotine dependence in 
late adolescence or early adulthood, 
putting adolescents at risk for 
lifelong nicotine dependence. 
35, 
 
36 
Use of e-cigarettes, even without 
nicotine, may normalize tobacco 
product use behaviors more 
generally, which could then lead 
to increased rates of addiction via 
use of other nicotine-containing 
products, including cigarettes and 
other harmful combustible tobacco 
products. 
35 
–37 Second, in addition to 
lifelong problems associated with 
nicotine dependence, exposure to 
nicotine in adolescence adversely 
affects cognitive function and 
development. 
19 There is also 
evidence that e-cigarettes may 
generate aldehydes and other toxic 
chemicals and that flavoring additives

may induce adverse respiratory 
health effects in e-cigarette users. 
38 
Although the adverse health effects 
of e-cigarettes may be less than 
those of cigarettes, the long-term 
consequences of e-cigarette use are 
not known because these products 
have been on the market for less than 
a decade.
CONCLUSIONS
Longitudinal data on emerging 
adolescent tobacco and alternative 
tobacco product use, including 
detailed information on topography 
of e-cigarette use and dose of 
nicotine, are needed to understand 
the role of e-cigarettes in nicotine 
addiction and whether e-cigarette 
users who have not used combustible 
cigarettes will, in the future, continue 
using e-cigarettes only, quit using 
tobacco products altogether, or 
progress to combustible cigarette 
users or dual users of both products. 
However, the high combined 
prevalence of e-cigarette use or 
cigarette use in 2014, compared 
with historical Southern California 
smoking prevalence, suggests 
that adolescents are not merely 
substituting e-cigarettes for 
cigarettes but that e-cigarettes are 
instead recruiting a new group of 
users who would not likely have 
initiated combustible tobacco 
product use in the absence of 
e-cigarettes, which poses a potential 
threat to the public health of 
adolescent populations.
