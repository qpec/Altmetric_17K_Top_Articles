The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) 
recommends that adolescents aged 11–12 years routinely receive 
vaccines to prevent diseases, including human papillomavirus 
(HPV)-associated cancers, pertussis, and meningococcal 
disease (1). To assess vaccination coverage among adolescents 
in the United States, CDC analyzed data collected regarding 
21,875 adolescents through the 2015 National Immunization 
Survey-Teen (NIS-Teen).* During 2014–2015, coverage 
among adolescents aged 13–17 years increased for each HPV 
vaccine dose among males, including ≥1 HPV vaccine dose 
(from 41.7% to 49.8%), and increased modestly for ≥1 HPV 
vaccine dose among females (from 60.0% to 62.8%) and ≥1 
quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY) 
dose (from 79.3% to 81.3%). Coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine 
dose was higher among adolescents living in households below 
the poverty level, compared with adolescents in households at 
or above the poverty level.† HPV vaccination coverage (≥1, ≥2, 
or ≥3 doses) increased in 28 states/local areas among males 
and in seven states among females. Despite limited progress, 
HPV vaccination coverage remained lower than MenACWY 
and tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) 
coverage, indicating continued missed opportunities for HPV-
associated cancer prevention.
NIS-Teen monitors vaccination coverage among adolescents 
aged 13–17 years in the 50 states, District of Columbia (DC), 
selected local areas, and territories§ using a random-digit–dialed 
sample of landline and cell phone numbers.¶ Through tele-
phone interviews with adolescents’ parents/guardians, infor-
mation is collected on adolescent, maternal, and household 
sociodemographic characteristics and vaccination providers. 
After receiving respondent consent, questionnaires are mailed 
to all identified vaccination providers to obtain immunization 
information from medical records.** All coverage estimates 
are based on provider-reported vaccination histories from 
adolescents with adequate provider data. In 2015, national 
estimates included information regarding 21,875 adolescents 
(10,508 females and 11,367 males).†† NIS-Teen method-
ology, including methods for weighting and synthesizing 
provider-reported vaccination histories, has been described 
separately (ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/
Dataset_Documentation/NIS/NISTEENPUF14_DUG.pdf). 
A revised adequate provider data definition was implemented 
in 2014 and retrospectively applied to 2013 NIS-Teen data 
for purposes of comparability (http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/
imz-managers/coverage/nis/teen/apd-report.html). Statistical 
comparisons were made using t-tests on weighted data to

* Eligible participants were born during January 1997–February 2003. Tdap 
represents coverage with ≥1 Tdap dose at or after age 10 years. DMenACWY 
represents coverage with the quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine or 
meningococcal-unknown type vaccine. ACIP published Category B 
recommendations for the use of serogroup B meningococcal (MenB) vaccines 
in October 2015 (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6441a3.
htm), with administration preferred at ages 16–18 years. Coverage with MenB 
vaccines is not included in 2015 NIS-Teen vaccination coverage estimates. 
HPV vaccination coverage represents receipt of any HPV vaccine and does not 
distinguish among 9-valent (9vHPV), quadrivalent (4vHPV), or bivalent 
(2vHPV) vaccines. Some adolescents might have received more than the 3 
recommended HPV vaccine doses. Except as noted, coverage estimates for ≥1 
and ≥2 varicella vaccine doses were obtained among adolescents with no history 
of varicella disease. Influenza vaccination coverage data are not included in this 
report but are available online at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/fluvaxview/index.htm.
† Adolescents were classified as being below the federal poverty level if their total 
family income was less than the federal poverty level specified for the applicable 
family size and number of children aged <18 years. All others were classified as 
at or above the poverty level. Poverty status was unknown for 767 adolescents 
(http://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty.html).
 § Local areas that received Federal Section 317 immunization funds were sampled 
separately: Chicago, Illinois; New York, New York; Philadelphia County, 
Pennsylvania; Bexar County, Texas; and Houston, Texas. Two local areas (in 
Texas) were oversampled: El Paso County and Hidalgo County. Three territories 
was sampled separately in 2015: Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
 ¶ All identified cellular telephone households were eligible for interview. 
Sampling weights were adjusted for dual-frame (landline and cellular 
telephone), nonresponse, noncoverage, and overlapping samples of mixed 
telephone users. A description of NIS-Teen dual-frame survey methodology 
and its effect on reported vaccination estimates is available at http://www.cdc.
gov/vaccines/imz-managers/coverage/nis/child/dual-frame-sampling.html.
 
** The overall Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) 
response rate was 33.0%. Response rates for the landline and cell phone 
samples were 56.4% and 29.8%, respectively. For completed interviews in the 
states and local areas, 4,784 landline calls (53.4%) and 17,091 cell phone calls 
(48.9%) had adequate provider data. Overall, for states and local areas, 22% 
of completed interviews with adequate provider data were from landlines and 
78% were from cell phones. For U.S. territories, the landline and cell phone 
sample CASRO rates were 52.1% and 22.6% for Guam, 57.8% and 37.4% 
for Puerto Rico, and 69.6% and 41.5% for the U.S. Virgin Islands, respectively. 
The CASRO response rate is the product of three other rates: 1) the resolution 
rate (the proportion of telephone numbers that can be identified as either for 
business or residence), 2) the screening rate (the proportion of qualified 
households that complete the screening process), and 3) the cooperation rate 
(the proportion of contacted eligible households for which a completed 
interview is obtained).
 
†† Adolescents from Guam (192 females and 227 males), Puerto Rico 
(158 females and 181 males), and the U.S. Virgin Islands (222 females and 
236 males) were excluded from the national estimates.

sidered statistically significant at p<0.05.
National Vaccination Coverage
In 2015, among males, coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose 
was 49.8% and with ≥3 doses was 28.1%; among females 
coverage with ≥1 dose was 62.8% and with ≥3 doses was 
41.9% (Table 1) (Figure 1). During 2014–2015, among 
males, coverage with each HPV vaccine dose increased, with 
percentage point increases of 8.1 for ≥1 dose, 7.6 for ≥2 doses, 
and 6.5 for ≥3 doses. Among females, coverage with ≥1 HPV 
vaccine dose increased modestly (2.8 percentage points). 
Among all adolescents, coverage with ≥1 MenACWY dose 
increased 2.0 percentage points to 81.3%. Among adolescents 
aged 17 years, coverage with ≥2 MenACWY doses increased 
4.8 percentage points to 33.3%; an additional 5.3% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 4.4%–6.4%) received their first 
MenACWY dose on or after their 16th birthday.
In 2015, among all adolescents (females and males com-
bined), HPV vaccination coverage with ≥1 dose was 56.1% 
(95% CI = 54.9%–57.4%), with ≥2 doses was 45.4% (95% 
CI = 44.2%–46.7%), and with ≥3 doses was 34.9% (95% 
CI = 33.7%–36.1%). Among all adolescents, coverage with 
≥1 HPV vaccine dose was 30.3 percentage points lower than 
coverage with ≥1 Tdap dose and 25.2 percentage points lower 
than coverage with ≥1 MenACWY dose.
Vaccination Coverage by Selected Characteristics
In 2015, ≥1-dose HPV vaccination coverage among females 
aged 13 years was lower than coverage among females aged 
≥15 years, but was similar among males in all age groups 
(Table 1). Although HPV vaccination coverage remained

higher among females than among males, the percentage point 
difference in coverage estimates decreased over time (Figure 1). 
Coverage with each HPV vaccine dose and with ≥1 MenACWY 
dose was higher among Hispanic adolescents than among 
non-Hispanic white (white) adolescents; however, coverage 
with ≥2 measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine (MMR) doses 
and ≥3 hepatitis B vaccine doses was lower among Hispanic 
adolescents (Table 2). Coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose 
was higher among non-Hispanic black (black) adolescents, 
compared with white adolescents. Adolescents living below 
the federal poverty level had higher ≥1- and ≥2-dose HPV 
vaccination coverage than did adolescents living at or above the 
poverty level. Among subgroups stratified by race/ethnicity and 
poverty status, ≥1-dose HPV vaccination coverage was higher 
among Hispanic and black adolescents living below the poverty 
level compared with white adolescents living at or above the 
poverty level, and higher for black males compared to white 
males among those living at or above the poverty level.§§

State-Specific Vaccination Coverage
In 2015, vaccination coverage varied among the 50 states 
and DC (Table 3). Among males, ≥1-dose HPV vaccination 
coverage ranged from 34.8% (Kentucky) to 80.6% (Rhode 
Island) (Figure 2), and among females, from 47.7% (Wyoming) 
to 87.9% (Rhode Island) (Figure 3). Among males, ≥3-dose 
HPV vaccination coverage ranged from 16.0% (Tennessee) 
to 58.1% (Rhode Island), and among females, from 24.4% 
(Mississippi) to 68.0% (Rhode Island). Coverage with ≥1 Tdap 
dose ranged from 69.7% (Alaska) to 97.1% (Rhode Island) 
and for ≥1 MenACWY dose ranged from 55.3% (Mississippi) 
to 97.7% (Rhode Island).
Compared with 2014, HPV vaccination coverage among 
males (≥1, ≥2, or ≥3 doses) increased in 28 states/local areas 
(e.g., range for ≥1 HPV vaccine dose = 10.5–24.7 percentage 
points). Among females, HPV vaccination coverage (≥1, ≥2, 
or ≥3 doses) increased in seven states: Hawaii (≥2, ≥3 doses), 
Kansas (≥2 doses), Nevada (≥1, ≥2 doses), New Jersey (≥1,

Abbreviations: CI = confidence interval; HPV = human papillomavirus; MenACWY = quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine; MMR = measles, mumps, and 
rubella vaccine; Tdap = tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis vaccine.
 * Adolescents (n = 21,875) in the 2015 NIS-Teen were born during January 1997–February 2003.
 
† Adolescents’ race/ethnicity were reported by their parents or guardians. Adolescents identified in this report as white, black, Asian, American Indian/Alaska Native, 
or multiracial were reported by the parents or guardians as non-Hispanic. Adolescents identified as multiracial had more than one race category selected. 
Adolescents identified as Hispanic might be of any race. Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders were not included in the table because of small sample sizes.
 
§ Adolescents were classified as below poverty level if their total family income was less than the federal poverty level specified for the applicable family size and 
number of children aged <18 years. All others were classified as at or above the poverty level (http://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/poverty.html). 
Poverty status was unknown for 767 adolescents; these adolescents were not included in the estimates by poverty status.
 
¶ Estimates with 95% CI half-widths >10 might not be reliable.
 ** Includes percentages receiving Tdap vaccine at or after age 10 years.
 †† Statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in estimated vaccination coverage by race/ethnicity; reference group was non-Hispanic white adolescents.
 §§ Includes percentages receiving MenACWY and meningococcal-unknown type vaccine.
 ¶¶ ≥2 doses of MenACWY or meningococcal-unknown type vaccine. Calculated only among adolescents who were 17 years of age at interview (n = 3,984). Does 
not include adolescents who received their first dose of MenACWY vaccine at or after age 16 years.
 
*** HPV vaccine, 9-valent (9vHPV), quadrivalent (4vHPV), or bivalent (2vHPV). Percentages are reported separately for females only (n = 10,508) and for males only 
(n = 11,367). 9vHPV, 4vHPV, or 2vHPV are recommended for females, and 9vHPV or 4vHPV are recommended for males. Some adolescents might have received 
more than the 3 recommended HPV vaccine doses.
 ††† Statistically significant difference (p<0.05) in estimated vaccination coverage by poverty level; reference group was adolescents living at or above poverty level.

≥2 doses), Rhode Island (≥1, ≥3 doses), Tennessee (≥3 doses), 
and Texas (≥1 dose) (e.g., range for ≥1 HPV vaccine dose = 9.4–
21.0 percentage points). Three states experienced decreases in 
≥3-dose HPV vaccination coverage among females (Georgia, 
Indiana, and North Carolina; range = 13.5–16.2 percentage 
points). No decreases in HPV vaccination coverage were 
observed among males.
Healthy People 2020 Targets Among Adolescents 
Aged 13–15 Years
In 2015, the Healthy People 2020 target (80%) for adoles-
cents aged 13–15 years¶¶ was met nationally for the fifth survey 
year for ≥1 dose of Tdap (87.1% [95% CI = 85.9%–88.2%]) 
and, for the first survey year, for ≥1 dose of MenACWY 
(80.8% [95% CI = 79.4%–82.1%]). Targets were not met 
for ≥3 HPV doses (target 80%) in males (27.1% [95% 
CI = 25.1%–29.2%]) or females (37.1% [95% CI = 34.8%–
39.5%]) or ≥2 varicella vaccine doses (target = 90%) (84.6% 
[95% CI = 83.2%–85.9%]).
Discussion
In 2015, coverage with each HPV vaccine dose increased 
among males, however, among females, ≥1-dose HPV vacci-
nation coverage increased only modestly, and no change was 
observed in coverage with ≥2 and ≥3 HPV doses. During 2015, 
as in previous years, coverage with ≥1 HPV vaccine dose was 
lower than coverage with Tdap and MenACWY, two other 
vaccines routinely recommended at age 11–12 years. These 
gaps in coverage demonstrate ongoing missed opportunities for 
HPV vaccination at visits when other recommended vaccines 
are administered. A revised Healthcare Effectiveness Data and 
Information Set (HEDIS) measure will be implemented in 
2017 to assess receipt of Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV vaccines 
by age 13 years in both females and males combined in one 
composite indicator (2), enabling health plans to evaluate their 
performance in administering these vaccines to adolescents.
Each year in the United States, an estimated 24,600 newly 
diagnosed cancers are attributable to the two high-risk HPV 
types targeted by all currently licensed HPV vaccines, and an 
additional 3,800 are attributable to the five additional high-
risk HPV types included in the 9-valent HPV vaccine (3). 
Improvement in HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents 
is needed to decrease the number of future HPV-associated 
cancers (4). Strong clinician recommendations for HPV vac-
cination, and coadministration of the first HPV vaccine dose 
with Tdap and MenACWY vaccine at age 11–12 years during 
the same visit, would improve HPV vaccination coverage. 
Reasons for low HPV vaccination coverage, particularly among 
younger adolescents, include lack of a strong clinician recom-
mendation for HPV vaccine at age 11–12 years, recommending 
vaccination inconsistently based on perceived risk for adoles-
cents’ HPV exposure, or not recommending coadministration 
of routine vaccines (5,6). Clinicians also might overestimate 
parental concerns and underestimate HPV vaccine demand (7). 
Resources for clinicians to facilitate optimal communication 
with parents and adolescents regarding HPV and other recom-
mended vaccines are available at http://www.cdc.gov/hpv/.
Summary
What is already known about this topic?
To prevent diseases, including human papillomavirus (HPV)-
associated cancers, pertussis, and meningococcal disease, 
routine immunization of adolescents aged 11–12 years is 
recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization 
Practices. During 2006–2014, national coverage with ≥1 dose 
of tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) and 
≥1 dose of quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine 
(MenACWY) increased annually. Since 2007, among females, 
HPV vaccination coverage has lagged behind Tdap and 
MenACWY coverage, with gaps of 28 and 17 percentage points, 
respectively, in 2014. HPV vaccination coverage among males 
has increased annually since 2011, but remains lower than 
coverage among females.
What is added by this report?
In 2015, vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 
13–17 years increased for each HPV vaccine dose among males, 
≥1 HPV vaccine dose among females, and ≥1 MenACWY among 
all adolescents. HPV vaccination coverage continues to be lower 
than Tdap and MenACWY coverage. Wide variation in cover-
age by state was observed for all vaccines assessed. In 2015, 
28 states and local areas achieved increases in HPV vaccination 
coverage among males, and seven states achieved increases 
among females.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Although national-level ≥1-dose HPV vaccination coverage 
increased in 2015 among adolescents, it remained lower than 
Tdap and MenACWY coverage. This suggests that HPV vaccine is 
not being routinely administered at visits when other recom-
mended vaccines are given, and demonstrates ongoing missed 
opportunities for the prevention of HPV-associated outcomes, 
including cancers. Routine age-appropriate administration of all 
recommended vaccines to adolescents aged 11–12 years, and 
strong, consistent recommendations by clinicians are impor-
tant to maintaining high vaccination coverage for Tdap and 
MenACWY vaccines and improving HPV vaccination coverage.
¶¶ Healthy People 2020 targets for vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 
13–15 years are 80.0% for ≥1 Tdap, ≥1 MenACWY, and ≥3 HPV vaccine 
doses among females and males, and 90.0% for ≥2 varicella vaccine doses 
(https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/topics-objectives/topic/immunization-
and-infectious-diseases/objectives). State and selected local area-level coverage 
estimates for vaccines included in the Healthy People 2020 objectives among 
adolescents aged 13–15 years will be available at http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/
vaxview/teenvaxview.

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
At a national level, ≥1 and ≥2 HPV and ≥2 varicella vac-
cination coverage estimates among adolescents living below 
the federal poverty level were higher than among those living 
at or above the poverty level. Coverage with other vaccines 
was similar by poverty status. Differences in HPV vaccina-
tion coverage by race/ethnicity and poverty status have been 
observed previously (8). Higher HPV vaccination coverage 
among adolescents living below the poverty level might, in 
part, be because of the routine provision of strong recom-
mendations for HPV vaccination and consistent coadminis-
tration of vaccines by clinicians caring for adolescents from 
lower income households (5,6). Other factors might include 
clinicians’ participation in, and adolescents’ eligibility for, the 
Vaccines for Children (VFC) program*** and differential vac-
cine acceptance by poverty status.
Many states and local areas achieved increases in HPV vac-
cination coverage. In 2014–2015, CDC provided technical 
assistance and Prevention and Public Health Fund (PPHF) 
resources to immunization programs and national partner 
organizations to implement interventions for improving HPV 
vaccination coverage.††† Activities included clinician education, 
clinical practice quality improvement strategies (e.g., CDC’s 
Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange programmatic 
initiative [http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/afix/index.
html]), patient reminder/recall (9), communication campaigns, 
and stakeholder engagement.††† Measurable impact of quality 
improvement activities at a clinical practice level can be achieved 
in short time horizons, but the impact of programmatic inter-
ventions on population-level vaccination coverage outcomes 
can take time to occur and be difficult to sustain. Also, because 
NIS-Teen assesses vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 
13–17 years, the impact of activities targeted at improving HPV 
vaccination at the recommended age of 11–12 years will not 
be measurable until at least 1–2 years after implementation. 
However, evidence suggests that multifaceted interventions 
that emphasize providing strong recommendations for routine, 
on-time vaccination at age 11–12 years might be effective in 
improving HPV vaccination delivery (9,10).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limitations. 
First, the overall household response rate was 33.0% (56.4% for 
the landline and 29.8% for the cell phone samples), and only 
53.4% of landline-completed and 48.9% of cell phone–completed 
interviews had adequate provider data. Second, bias in estimates 
might remain even after adjustment for household and provider 
nonresponse and phoneless households.§§§ Weights have been 
adjusted for the increasing number of cell phone–only households 
over time. Nonresponse bias might change, which could affect 
comparisons of estimates between survey years. Third, estimates 
stratified by state/local area and those stratified by race/ethnicity 
might be unreliable because of small sample sizes. Fourth, multiple 
statistical tests were conducted, and a small number might be 
significant because of chance alone. Finally, ≥2-dose MenACWY 
coverage likely underestimates the proportion of adolescents who 
receive ≥2 MenACWY doses. Adolescents might receive their 
second MenACWY dose after age 17 years (1); because NIS-Teen 
includes adolescents aged 13–17 years, receipt of MenACWY at 
age ≥18 years cannot be captured in coverage estimates.
Widespread improvement in HPV vaccination coverage among 
males was observed in 2015 suggesting that clinicians are increas-
ingly administering HPV vaccine to males in accordance with 
ACIP recommendations. However, HPV vaccination coverage 
among adolescents remains lower than vaccination coverage 
with Tdap and the first MenACWY vaccine dose, demonstrating 
that HPV vaccine is not consistently coadministered with other 
recommended vaccines, and that missed opportunities for HPV-
associated cancer prevention are occurring. A revised HEDIS mea-
sure planned for implementation in 2017 will enable improved 
assessment of receipt of Tdap, MenACWY, and HPV vaccines by 
age 13 years among adolescents covered by U.S. health plans (2). 
Resources are available to help clinicians effectively communicate 
with parents and adolescents regarding the importance of HPV 
vaccination. Tools are available for immunization programs and 
partner organizations, including cancer prevention stakeholders, 
to improve awareness of and demand for vaccines recommended 
for adolescents, including HPV vaccine. Interventions aimed at 
improving HPV vaccination coverage are ongoing. To optimize 
protection of adolescents against vaccine-preventable diseases, 
including HPV-associated cancers, it is important for clinicians 
to consistently recommend and coadminister Tdap, MenACWY, 
and HPV vaccines at age 11–12 years.
 *** Children and adolescents aged ≤18 years who are Medicaid-eligible, uninsured, 
or American Indian/Alaska Native (as defined by the Indian Health Care 
Improvement Act) are eligible to receive vaccines from providers through the 
VFC program. Children categorized as “underinsured” (because their health 
plans do not include coverage for recommended vaccinations) are eligible to 
receive VFC vaccines if they are served by a rural health clinic or federally 
qualified health center or under an approved deputization agreement. (http://
www.cdc.gov/vaccines/programs/vfc/providers/eligibility.html).
 ††† CDC provided PPHF resources to 22 state and local immunization programs, 
the Academic Pediatric Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, 
American Cancer Society, the National Area Health Education Center 
Organization, and National Association of County and City Health Officials 
(http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2015-10/
hpv-03-curtis.pdf).
 §§§ A total survey error model of 2011 NIS-Teen that included comparison with 
provider-reported data from National Health Interview Survey participants 
indicated coverage estimates were 2.9–5.9 percentage points higher as a result 
of noncoverage and household nonresponse error; however, these estimates 
of bias might be too high because they do not account for possible under-
ascertainment of vaccination status (http://www.amstat.org/meetings/
jsm/2012/onlineprogram/abstractdetails.cfm?abstractid=304324 and http://
