ABSTRACT
Exercise training has been associated with
increased mitochondrial content and respiration. However,
no study to date has compared in parallel how training at
different intensities affects mitochondrial respiration and
markers of mitochondrial biogenesis. Twenty-nine healthy
men performed 4 wk (12 cycling sessions) of either sprint
interval training [SIT; 4–10 3 30-s all-out bouts at ∼200% of
peak power output (WPeak)], high-intensity interval training
(HIIT; 4–7 3 4-min intervals at ∼90% WPeak), or sublactate
threshold continuous training (STCT; 20–36 min at ∼65%
WPeak). The STCT and HIIT groups were matched for total
work.Restingbiopsysamples(vastuslateralis)wereobtained
before and after training. The maximal mitochondrial res-
piration in permeabilized muscle fibers increased significantly
only after SIT (25%). Similarly, the protein content of perox-
isome proliferator-activated receptor g coactivator (PGC)-1a,
p53, and plant homeodomain finger–containing protein 20
(PHF20) increased only after SIT (60–90%). Conversely, cit-
rate synthase activity, and the protein content of TFAM and
subunitsoftheelectrontransportsystemcomplexesremained
unchanged throughout. Our findings suggest that training in-
tensity is an important factor that regulates training-induced
changes in mitochondrial respiration and that there is an ap-
parent dissociation between training-induced changes in mi-
tochondrial respiration and mitochondrial content. Moreover,
changes in the protein content of PGC-1a, p53, and PHF20
are more strongly associated with training-induced changes
in mitochondrial respiration than mitochondrial content.—

Mitochondria are key components of skeletal muscles that
provide the energy necessary for almost all cellular activi-
ties and play an important role in ageing and cell pathol-
ogy. For example, mitochondria have been implicated in
many age-related degenerative diseases, cardiomyop-
athies, atherosclerosis, and in a large variety of meta-
bolic disorders (1, 2). Although early studies focused on
changes in mitochondrial enzymes, such as citrate syn-
thase (CS) activity, a common biomarker of mitochon-
drial content (3), subsequent studies have suggested
that increasing mitochondrial respiratory function may
contribute more to improvements in both health (2)
and endurance performance (4).
Exercise is one factor that provides a powerful stimulus
toincreasebothmitochondrialcontent(5)andrespiratory
function (6), yet little is known about the optimal exercise
dose and whether mitochondrial content and respiratory
function are altered by similar or different exercise pre-
scriptions. Although many factors (e.g., participants’ char-
acteristics, and training volume, frequency, and duration)
maycontribute,ithasbeensuggestedthattrainingintensity
is a key factor that modulates changes in mitochondrial
respiratory function (7). However, only a handful of stud-
ies have been conducted to investigate training-induced
changes in mitochondrial respiratory function in humans
(7–9), and only 1 study (6) directly compared the effects of
2 different training intensities on mitochondrial respira-
tion in permeabilized muscle fibers—the gold-standard
technique for determination of mitochondrial respira-
tory function (10). That study showed that mitochondrial

 respiration increases after 8 wk of high-intensity interval
training (HIIT), but not after work-matched continuous
training at a moderate intensity. This result is in contrast
with findings from an earlier study reporting an increase in
mitochondrial ATP production rate after 6 wk of continu-
ous training at a moderate intensity (11). Moreover, no
study has measured changes in mitochondrial respiration
after all-out sprint interval training (SIT), which has been
reported to induce mitochondrial adaptations similar to
those of continuous training at a moderate intensity (12).
Therefore, further investigation of the effects of training
protocols using different intervals and training intensities
on mitochondrial content and respiration is warranted.
Theoxidativecapacity ofmitochondriaisdetermined by
the abundance of mitochondrial proteins and their func-
tional capacity to produce ATP. This capacity is regulated
by transcriptional activity, a process requiring the con-
certed integration of signaling, transcription, and trans-
lation events taking place in both the nucleus and the
mitochondrion, followed by the import and incorporation
of the newly generated proteins into the mitochondrial
reticulum (13). Monitoring changes in these events not
only allows for an indirect assessment of mitochondrial
biogenesis, but may also contribute to a better under-
standing of the possible underlying cellular mechanisms.
Peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor g coactivator
(PGC)-1a is a transcriptional coactivator that has been
shown to regulate mitochondrial content and respiration
in human skeletal muscle (13) and also metabolic control
in rat skeletal muscle (14). Studies in human skeletal
muscle have shown that exercise training leads to an in-
crease in PGC-1a protein (5) and suggest that modulation
of PGC-1a mRNA is sensitive to training intensity (15).
However, there has been no investigation of the effects of
training at different intensities on changes in PGC-1a
protein abundance in conjunction with changes in both
mitochondrial content and respiration.
Thetumor suppressor p53isalso an importantregulator
of mitochondrial biogenesis (16). Studies in cells and mice
indicate that ablation of p53 leads to a reduction in mito-
chondrial respiration and content, and endurance per-
formance (17, 18). p53 is also up-regulated after a single
bout of exercise in human skeletal muscle(19)and, similar
to PGC-1a, has been shown to regulate the mitochondrial
transcription machinery via modulation of mitochondrial
transcription factor A (TFAM) (20, 21). Furthermore, by
regulation of downstream targets, p53 can control mito-
chondrial respiration by modulating the balance between
glycolytic and oxidative pathways (17) and has been linked
with mitochondrial dynamics and the maintenance of mi-
tochondrial morphology (16). Although the signaling
events upstream of p53 are not yet fully known, plant
homeodomain finger-containing protein 20 (PHF20) has
been shown to up-regulate p53 transcription (22) and to
stabilize p53 protein (23), emphasizing the role of PHF20
as a regulator of p53. Despite evidence demonstrating the
importance of the p53 pathway in the regulation of mito-
chondrial biogenesis, to our knowledge there has been no
examinationoftheeffectsofaperiodofexercisetrainingat
different intensities on p53 and upstream regulators and
downstream targets.
The purpose of this research was to compare the effects
of 12 sessions (4 wk) of sublactate threshold continuous
training (STCT), HIIT, and SIT on markers of mitochon-
drial biogenesis in the skeletal muscle of young moderately-
trained men. Given that an increase in mitochondrial
respiration (8, 9), markers of mitochondrial biogenesis
(5), and endurance performance (8) has been reported
after 6 to 10 training sessions, we hypothesized that 12
training sessions would result in positive physiological
and mitochondrial adaptations. We further hypothesized
that higher training intensities would produce greater
improvements in mitochondrial respiration and that
these changes would be associated with increased protein
content of the transcription factors known to regulate
mitochondrial biogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants and ethics approval
Thirty-one healthy men volunteered to take part in this study.
Only participants who were 1) healthy men aged 18–35 yr, 2) free
of medications before and during the study, 3) nonsmokers, 4)
not regularly engaged in a structured training program, 5)
moderately trained (i.e., whose aerobic activity in the 6 mo before
commencementof the study was limited to a maximumof 3 h/wk
of light, unstructured aerobic activity), and 6) not regularly en-
gaged in cycling-based sports (e.g., cycling, mountain biking, and
triathlon) wereallowed to take part in theresearch.After medical
screening to rule out any conditions that may have precluded
their participation (e.g., cardiovascular, metabolic, or musculo-
skeletal problems), the participants were informed of the study
requirements, benefits, and risks, before giving written in-
formed consent. Approval of the study’s procedures, which
conformed to the standards set by the latest revision of the
Declaration of Helsinki, was granted by the Victoria University
Human Research Ethics Committee. After initial screening
and testing, participants were matched by the power (in watts)
attained at the lactate threshold (WLT) and randomly assigned
to the STCT (n = 10), HIIT (n = 11), or SIT (n = 10) group.
Twenty-nine participants completed the study, whereas 2, one
each from the STCT and SIT groups, withdrew because of
time constraints. Baseline physiological parameters for each
group are described in Table 1.
Study design
The experimental protocol consisted of, in the following order, a
20-km cycling time trial (20k TT), a graded exercise test (GXT)
(participants were previously familiarized with both tests), and
a resting muscle biopsy. All tests were separated by a minimum of

 48 h (72 h for the biopsy trial). During the training phase, the
participants trained 3 times a week for 4 wk, with the STCT and
HIIT groups matched for total work. Because of the nature of
sprint training, it was not possible to match the SIT group for total
work with the other 2 groups. Seventy-two hours after the last
training session a resting muscle biopsy was performed, fol-
lowed by the 20k TT and GXT, separated by 48 h. The study
duration inclusive of pre- and post-training testing was ;7 wk.
Testing procedures
Participants were required to refrain from any strenuous physical
activity for the 48 h before each performance test (72 h for the
biopsytrial),fromalcoholandanyexercisefor24hbeforetesting,
and from food and caffeine consumption for the 2 h before each
test. Each type of test was performed at the same time of the day
during the course of the entire study with the purpose of avoiding
variations caused by changes in circadian rhythm.
20k TT
Cycling time trials were performed on an electronically braked
cycle ergometer (Velotron; RacerMate, Seattle, WA, USA) after a
warm-up involving cycling for 4 min at 66% of WLT, followed by
2 min at WLT, and 2 min of rest. During the time trial, the partici-
pants were allowed access to only cadence and completed dis-
tance. Heart rate was monitored (Polar-Electro, Kempele, Finland)
during all exercise trials and training sessions.
GXT
A discontinuous graded exercise test was performed on an elec-
tronically braked cycle ergometer (Excalibur, v2.0; Lode, Groningen,
The Netherlands) to determine peak oxygen uptake (VO2Peak),
peak power output (WPeak), WLT [by the modified DMax method
(24)], and training intensities for the STCT and HIIT groups. The
test consisted of 4-min stages at a constant power output, in-
terspersed with 30 s of rest. The test began at 60, 90, or 120 W,
depending on the participant’s fitness level, and was subsequently
increased by 30 W every 4 min. Before the test and during the 30 s
rest, capillary blood samples were taken from the fingertip for
measurement of blood lactate concentration ([La2]). The partic-
ipantwasinstructedtokeepacadence.60rpmandwasallowedto
viewonlythecadenceandelapsedtime.Thetestwasstoppedwhen
the participant reached volitional exhaustion or cadence dropped
below 60 rpm. The WPeak was determined as the power of the last
completed stage plus 7.5 W for every additional minute completed.
Gas analysis during the GXT
During the GXT, expired air was continuously analyzed for
O2 and CO2 concentrations via a gas analyzer (Moxus 2010;
AEI Technologies, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), which was calibrated
immediately before each test. The ventilometer was cali-
brated with a 3-L syringe (Hans Rudolph, Shawnee, KS, USA).
Vo2 was recorded every 15 s and the average of the 2 highest
consecutive 15-s readings was recorded as a participant’s
VO2Peak.
Capillary blood sampling
Glass capillary tubes were used to collect ;50 ml of blood at the
various time points during the GXT. Capillary blood [La2] was
determined with a blood lactate analyzer (2300 STAT Plus; YSI,
Yellow Spring, OH, USA), which was regularly calibrated using
precision standards.
Muscle biopsies
Before and after training, resting muscle biopsies were taken
from the vastus lateralis muscle with a biopsy needle with
suction, under local anesthesia of the skin and fascia (1%
lidocaine). Muscle samples were cleaned of excess blood, fat,
and connective tissue; 1 portion (10–20 mg) was immediately
immersed in ;3 ml of ice-cold biopsy preservation solution
(BioPS; see below) for in situ measurement of mitochon-
drial respiration. The remaining portion was immediately
frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 280°C for subsequent
analyses.
Training intervention
All training sessions were performed on an electronically
braked cycle ergometer (Velotron; RacerMate) and were
preceded by an 8 min warm-up as described in the 20k TT
section.
STCT
Training sessions consisted of continuous cycling at a fixed power
equivalent to 90, 92.5, 95, and 97.5% of baseline WLT for wk 1–4,
respectively (Fig. 1). The workload was matched to that com-
pleted by the HIIT group.

 HIIT
Training sessions consisted of 4-min cycling intervals interspersed
with a2-min recovery at60 W. Training intensitieswere definedas
WLT + x(WPeak 2 WLT), where x = 0.35, 0.50, 0.65, and 0.75 for wk
1–4, respectively (Fig. 1). For both STCT and HIIT, training in-
tensity was set relative to WLT rather than WPeak, as metabolic and
cardiac stresses are similar when individuals of differing fitness
levels exercise at a percentage of the WLT, but can vary signifi-
cantly when they train at a percentage of WPeak (25).
SIT
Training sessions consisted of 30-s bouts of all-out cycling against
resistance set at 0.075 kg/kg body mass (BM) interspersed with a
4-min rest (Fig. 1). During the last 15 s of the rest period the
participants were instructed to reach a cadence of 80–100 rpm
against no resistance, and, in the last 2 s, they began pedaling as
fast as possible, before the load was applied by the software
(Velotron Wingate; RacerMate).
Physical activity and nutritional control
The participants were instructed to maintain a normal dietary
pattern and their routine physical activity throughout the study.
To minimize the variability in muscle metabolism attributable to
diet, they were provided a standardized dinner (55 kJ/kg BM,
providing 2.1 g carbohydrate/kg BM, 0.3 g fat/kg BM, and 0.6 g
protein/kg BM) and breakfast (41 kJ/kg BM, providing 1.8 g
carbohydrate/kg BM, 0.2g fat/kgBM, and 0.3 g protein/kg BM),
to be consumed 15 and 3 h before the biopsy trials, respectively.
Participants were also required to keep a nutrition diary in which
they recorded the last 3 meals before each performance test un-
dertaken duringbaseline testing, and they were asked to replicate
the nutritional intake thereafter before the same type of test.
Skeletal muscle analyses
Fiber preparation and high-resolution respirometry
Muscle fibers were mechanically separated with pointed for-
ceps in ice-cold BioPS containing (in mM) 2.77 CaK2EGTA,
7.23 K2EGTA, 5.77 Na2ATP, 6.56 MgCl2, 20 taurine, 50 2-(N-
morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 15 Na2-phosphocreatine,
20 imidazole, and 0.5 DTT adjusted to pH 7.1 (26). The plasma
membrane was permeabilized by gentle agitation for 30 min at
4°C in BioPS containing 50 mg/ml saponin and was followed by
3 washes in MiR05, a respiration medium containing (in mM,
unless specified) 0.5 EGTA, 3 MgCl2, 60 potassium-lactobionate,
20 taurine, 10 KH2PO4, 20 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-1-
ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), 110 sucrose, and 1 g/L bovine se-
rum albumin (BSA), essentially fatty acid–free (pH 7.1) (26).
Mitochondrial respiration was measured in duplicate (from 3–4 mg
wet weight of muscle fibers) in MiR05 at 37°C by using the high-
resolution Oxygraph-2k (Oroboros, Innsbruck, Austria). Oxygen
concentration (in nanomoles per milliliter) and flux (in pico-
moles per second per milligram) were recorded with DatLab
software (Oroboros). Reoxygenation by direct syringe injection
of O2 was necessary to maintain O2 levels between 275 and
450 nmol/ml and to avoid potential oxygen diffusion limitation.
Mitochondrial respiration protocol
A substrate–uncoupler–inhibitor titration (SUIT) protocol
was used (26), and the SUIT sequence was as follows: pyruvate
(5 mM) and malate (2 mM) in the absence of adenylates were
added for measurement of leak respiration (L) through
complex I (CI) (CIL). ADP (5 mM) was added for mea-
surement of maximum oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos)
capacity (P) through CI (CIP), followed by addition of suc-
cinate (10 mM) for measurement of P through CI+II combined
(CI+IIP). Cytochrome c (10 mM) was then added to test for
outer mitochondrial membrane integrity, followed by a series
of stepwise carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenyl-
hydrazone (FCCP) titrations (0.75–1.5 mM), for measure-
ment of electron transport system (ETS) capacity (E) through
CI+II (CI+IIE). Rotenone (0.5 mM), an inhibitor of CI, was
added to determine E through CII (CIIE), whereas addition
of antimycin A (2.5 mM), an inhibitor of CIII, allowed measure-
ment and correction of residual oxygen consumption (ROX),
indicative of nonmitochondrial oxygen consumption. Ascorbate
(2 mM) and N,N,N9,N9-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD;
0.5 mM), artificial electron donors for CIV, were then added to
measure E through CIV (CIVE). Respiratory flux control ratios
(FCRs) were calculated. In brief, the leak control ratio (LCR)
is the quotient of CIL over CI+IIE; the phosphorylation control
ratio (PCR) is the quotient of CI+IIP over CI+IIE; the coupling
control ratio is the quotient of CIL over CI+IIP and is equivalent
to the inverse respiratory control ratio (inv-RCR); the substrate
control ratio (SCR) at constant P is the quotient of CIP over
CI+IIP; the reserve capacity of CIV (CIVRes) was determined
as the quotient of CI+IIP over CIVE.
Preparation of whole-muscle lysates
Frozen muscle (;10–20 mg) was homogenized in anice-cold lysis
buffer (1:20 w/v) containing 50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM
EDTA, a protease/phosphatase inhibitor cocktail [Cell Signaling
Technology (CST), Danvers, MA, USA], and 1 mM PMSF, ad-
justed to pH 7.4. Muscle homogenates were rotated at 4°C for
60 min and centrifuged at 15,000 g at 4°C for 20 min, and the
supernatant was used for immunoblot analysis and enzyme activity
assay. Protein concentration was determined in triplicate with a
commercial colorimetric assay (Protein Assay kit-II; Bio-Rad,
Gladesville, NSW, Australia).
Immunoblot analysis
Muscle lysates (10–25 mg) were separated by electrophoresis on
SDS polyacrylamide gels (8–12%) and transferred to PVDF
membranes, before being blocked for 1 h in 5% skim milkinTris-
buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST). Membranes were
incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary anti-
bodies: apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), dynamin-related protein 1
(DRP1), mitofusin 2, p53, and PHF20 (all from CST); PGC-1a
(EMS-Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA); synthesis of cytochrome
c oxidase 2 (SCO2) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA); and TFAM and total oxphos (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). The membranes were then incubated at room temper-
ature with the appropriate host species–specific secondary
antibody for 90 min, before being exposed to a chemi-
luminescence solution. Three TBST washes were performed
between each step. Protein bands were visualized with a Bio-
Rad Versa-Doc imaging system, and bands were quantified with
Bio-Rad Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). An internal standard
was loaded on each gel, and each lane was normalized to that
value,to reduce gel-to-gelvariability.Coomassiebluestainingwas
used to qualitatively verify correct loading and equal transfer
between lanes (27). Statistical analysis was performed on the raw
density data (Supplemental Table S1). For graphical purposes, each

 participant’s time point value was normalized to baseline;
therefore, immunoblot data are presented as fold change vs.
baseline.
CS activity assay
CS activity was determined in triplicate on a microtiter plate by
adding 5 ml of a 2 mg/ml muscle homogenate, 40 ml of 3 mM
acetyl CoA, and 25 ml of1 mM 5,59-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB) in Tris buffer to 165 ml 100 mM Tris buffer
(pH 8.3) kept at 30°C. After addition of 15 ml of 10 mM oxa-
loacetic acid, the plate was immediately placed in an xMark-
Microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad) at 30°C, and after
30 s of linear agitation, absorbance at 412 nm was recorded
every 15 s for 3 min. CS activity is reported as moles per hour
per kilogram protein.

 Statistical analysis
All values are reported as means 6 SD, unless specified otherwise.
A 1-way ANOVA was used to assess differences between the 3
groups at baseline and for total training workload. To investigate
the influence of treatment and time and the interaction between
bothofthesevariables,2-wayANOVAforrepeatedmeasureswere
used. Significant interactions and main effects were further ana-
lyzed with a Tukey’s honestly significant difference post hoc test.
The least-squares linear regression analysis was used to calculate
correlation coefficients between variables, according to Pearson’s
product moment (r). SigmaStat software (Jandel Scientific, San
Rafael, CA, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. The level of
statistical significance was set at P , 0.05.
RESULTS
Training and performance measurements
Participantswerematchedforage,height,VO2Peak(Table1),
BM, WLT, WPeak, and 20k TT time (Table 2) (all P . 0.05).
ParticipantsintheSITgroupcompletedasignificantlylower
amount of total work (;35%) compared with those in the
HIIT and STCT groups (1.3 6 0.2, 3.6 6 0.6, and 3.8 6
0.7 MJ for the SIT, HIIT, and STCT groups respectively,
P , 0.001). There were no changes in BM after training
(main effect of time, P = 0.594; Table 2). WLT increased
after training in all 3 training interventions (all P , 0.001),
with no differencebetweenconditions (P= 0.754;Table2).
WPeak increased significantly after SIT (P= 0.011) and HIIT
(P , 0.001), and there was a similar trend after STCT,
although it failed toreach significance (P = 0.063; Table 2).
20k TT time improved significantly after STCT and HIIT
(both P , 0.001), but did not change after SIT (P = 0.177;
Table 2).
Mass-specific mitochondrial respiration
Absolute mass-specific mitochondrial respiration values
are presented in Table3,and changes are shown in Fig.2A.
SIT was the only group that increased maximum coupled
(CI+IIP) and noncoupled (CI+IIE) respiration (interac-
tion, P = 0.008 and 0.028 respectively). CI+IIP increased
significantly after SIT (P , 0.001) and did not change after
HIIT or STCT (both P . 0.05). Similarly, CI+IIE increased
significantly after SIT (P = 0.001) and did not change after
HIIT or STCT (both P . 0.05). CIIE also increased signif-
icantly after SIT (P = 0.002) and did not change after HIIT
or STCT (both P . 0.05; interaction, P = 0.027). Although
it failed to reach statistical significance, the same trend was
observed for CIP (interaction, P = 0.055) and CIVE (in-
teraction, P = 0.061), whereas CIL did not change (main
effect of time, P = 0.312). The data presented in this study
showed no effect of the addition of cytochrome c as a
control for outer mitochondrial membrane integrity.
There were no significant differences in any of the FCRs
measured (all P . 0.05; Table 4).
Mitochondrial-specific respiration
CS activity did not change significantly after any of the
training interventions (main effect of time, P = 0.227;
Table 2). Mitochondrial-specific respiration absolute val-
ues (obtained by normalizing mass-specific mitochondrial
respiration to CS activity expressed per kilogram protein)
are presented in Table 3, and changesare shown in Fig. 2B.
SIT was once again the only training intervention that
significantly increased maximum coupled (CI+IIP) and
noncoupled (CI+IIE) respiration (interaction, P = 0.019
and P = 0.045, respectively). Specifically, CI+IIP/CS in-
creased significantly after SIT (P = 0.014) and did not
change after HIIT or STCT (both P . 0.05). Similarly,
CI+IIE/CS increased significantly after SIT (P = 0.013) and
did not change after HIIT or STCT (both P . 0.05). CIIE/CS
also increased significantly after SIT (P = 0.004) and did
not change after HIIT or STCT (both P . 0.05; interac-
tion, P = 0.013). Despite not reaching statistical sig-
nificance, the same trend was observed for CIP/CS
(interaction, P = 0.107) and CIVE/CS (P = 0.072). CIL/CS
did not change (main effect of time, P = 0.931).

 Protein content of transcription factors
PGC-1a protein content increased by 61 6 58% after SIT
(P = 0.011), but did not change significantly after HIIT or
STCT (both P . 0.05; Fig. 3A). p53 protein content in-
creased by 93 6 77% after SIT (P = 0.004), but did not
change significantly after HIIT or STCT (both P . 0.05;
Fig. 3B). The protein content of PHF20 increased by
84 6 76% after SIT (P = 0.003), but did not change
significantly after HIIT or STCT (both P . 0.05; Fig. 3C).
TFAM protein content did not change after training
(main effect of time, P = 0.400; Fig. 3D).
Protein content of subunits from the 5 ETS complexes
and of mitofusin-2, DRP1, SCO2, and AIF
The protein content of subunits from the 5 ETS complexes
did not change significantly after training (all P . 0.05; Fig.
4). Protein content of mitofusin 2 increased after training,
with no significant difference between groups (main effect
of time,P = 0.047; Fig. 5A).DRP1 protein content showed a
trend toward increasing after training, with no difference
between groups (main effect of time, P = 0.063; Fig. 5B). The
proteincontentofSCO2andAIFdidnotchangewithtraining
(main effect of time, both P . 0.05; Fig. 5C, D, respectively).
Correlation between mass-specific mitochondrial
respiration and performance measurements
There was a significant linear correlation between CI+IIP
and 20k TT performance before training (r = 20.65; P ,
0.001; Fig. 6A). No correlation was found between changes
in CI+IIP and 20k TT performance with training (r = 0.21;
P = 0.279; Fig. 6B), and the initial correlation was no
longer significant after training (r = 20.26; P = 0.188).
Likewise, CI+CIIP correlated significantly with WLT and
WPeak before training (r = 0.60 and r = 0.67, respectively;
both P , 0.001), but there was no correlation between
their changes (r = 0.08 and r = 20.35, respectively; both
P . 0.05) or after training (r = 0.27 and r = 0.16, respec-
tively; both P . 0.05).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, 4 wk of SIT increased mitochondrial
respiration in young moderately-trained men, whereas
4 wk of training at lower intensities (STCT, HIIT) induced
no change, despite much higher training volumes. In ad-
dition, the results show for the first time that 4 wk of SIT
increased the protein content of p53. This result, along
with changes in PGC-1a protein content may help to ex-
plain the greater changes in mitochondrial respiration after
SIT. Furthermore, the protein content of PHF20, a tran-
scription factor upstream of p53, also increased after SIT,
providing further insights into the cellular events that may
contribute to the adaptive response to exercise training.
Mass-specific mitochondrial respiration
A novel aspect of this research was to assess the effects of
different training intensities on training-induced changes
in mitochondrial respiration. Our results show that CI+IIP
increased by 25% after 4 wk of SIT, whereas neither HIIT
nor STCT was associated with an increase in mass-specific
respiration. These findings highlight the role of training
intensity as an important determinant of changes in mi-
tochondrial respiration. Although caution is advised,
because of various methodological differences between
studies, such as training volume and duration, or the dif-
ferences in age and training status of the populations ex-
amined, it is relevant to compare our results with those in
the literature that assessed training-induced changes in
mitochondrial respiration in permeabilized fibers (6, 8, 9).
The training intensities we report below were recalculated
based on unpublished data from our lab suggesting that
the continuous incremental cycling tests used in two of
those studies (6, 8) yield a value for WPeak that is ;15%
higher than that obtained with our GXT protocol. In the
studies by Daussin et al. (6), Jacobs et al. (8), and Vincent
et al. (9), interval training at intensities of ;105–120% of
WPeak led to increases in mass-specific respiration of
10–40%, which is in line with the 25% increase after SIT.

 STCT groups (89 and 66% of WPeak, respectively) did not
improve mass-specific mitochondrial respiration, and the
results are in agreement with those for the continuous
training group (71% of WPeak) in Daussin et al. (6).
It has been suggested that workload and oxygen-uptake
fluctuations, rather than training volume or intensity, are
key determinants of training-induced improvements in
mitochondrialrespiration(6).However,althoughworkload
and oxygen uptake fluctuations are hallmarks of both SIT
and HIIT, only SIT, which elicits a much higher training
intensity, increased mass-specific mitochondrial respira-
tion in our study. This finding further strengthens the
notion that training intensity is an important factor for
training-induced improvements in mitochondrial respira-
tion. Similar to Daussin et al. (6), our research suggests that
training volume is less important in determining changes
in mitochondrial respiration, as neither STCT nor HIIT
improved mass-specific mitochondrial respiration after
4 wk of training, despite a training volume almost 3 times
greater than SIT. This result may be explained by findings
from previous reports that showed muscle fiber activation
increases with exercise intensity (28) and that SIT elicits
greater reliance on oxidative phosphorylation within each
bout and with each subsequent bout (29). Therefore,

 although further research is needed, the higher training
intensity associated with SIT may have improved mito-
chondrial respiration by maximally stressing the oxidative
phosphorylation system and by recruiting a wider fiber
pool than HIIT and STCT.
Mitochondrial qualitative and quantitative changes
Our results showed that no training intervention signifi-
cantly altered CS activity, a commonly used biomarker of
mitochondrial content (3). Although many studies have
reported increased CS activity after training at various in-
tensities, the literature also provides evidence of unaltered
or even decreased CS activity after training (30). The rea-
sons for these discrepancies are not readily apparent, but
may relate to methodological differences in CS activity as-
say (30), the participants’ fitness level or training status,
and differences in training duration or study design. To
separate qualitative and quantitative changes, we de-
termined mitochondrial-specific respiration, by normaliz-
ing mass-specific respiration to CS activity. Figure 2B
shows that changes in mitochondrial-specific respiration
mirrored the changes in mass-specific respiration. This
finding indicates that SIT resulted in increased mito-
chondrial respiration relative to mitochondrial content.
Although cross-sectional research has reported that dif-
ferences in the maximal aerobic capacity of individuals of
various fitness levels are accompanied by modifications in
mitochondrial-specific respiration(31),ourresultsarethe
first to show that these modifications can be achieved in as
little as 4 wk of SIT in moderately-trained individuals. In
addition, the lack of change in the protein content of
subunits from the 5 ETS complexes (similar to CS activity)
provides further evidence that changes in mitochondrial
respiration can take place before, or independent of,
changes in mitochondrial content. These findings also
highlight a dissociation between mitochondrial respiration
and mitochondrial content, as was demonstrated in mice
(32). Although further research is needed, the lack of
change in mitochondrial content may be the result of
matched changes in protein synthesis and degradation,
such that replacement of damaged proteins with newly
synthesized ones may contribute to the increase in mito-
chondrial respiration (33). Finally, analysis of the FCRs
indicates that there was no change in the index of un-
coupling (LCR), the limitation of oxphos capacity by the
phosphorylation system (PCR), the degree of coupling
between oxidation and phosphorylation (inv-RCR), and
substrate control (SCR and CIVRes). These results suggest
that increased oxidative capacity after SIT is mediated by
an improvement in mitochondrial-specific respiration
without changes in the coupling and substrate control of
the respiratory system. Further investigation of the possible
underlying mechanisms is warranted.
Mitochondrial proteins and transcription factors
To investigate the cellular events associated with the adap-
tive response to training, we measured the protein con-
tent of key regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis. PGC-1a
protein content was significantly increased only after
SIT, in agreement with a report of increased PGC-1a in
whole-muscle fractions of male participants after 3 wk of SIT
(34). Although separate studies have shown that PGC-1a
can be increased after SIT, HIIT, or continuous training
(5,12,34),nostudytodatehasreportedchangesinPGC-1a
protein content in response to exercise training at 3 dif-
ferent intensities within 1 study. Research has indicated
that, after a single bout of exercise, PGC-1a mRNA is reg-
ulated in an intensity-dependent manner (15), but that this
intensity-dependent regulation is limited to exercise in-
tensities below peak power (35). However, our findings
indicate that the intensity-dependent regulation of PGC-1a
protein may extend to intensities above peak power.
The importance of training intensity is strengthened
further when considering that, despite much greater
training volumes, neither STCT nor HIIT increased
PGC-1a protein content.
In the present study, only SIT increased p53 protein
content, indicating a possible intensity-dependent regula-
tion similar to that of PGC-1a. This increase, coupled with
greater mitochondrial respiration after SIT, is consistent
with the role of p53 as a metabolic regulator and its ability
to modulate the switch from glycolytic to oxidative energy

 provision (17). In mouse liver mitochondria, this modu-
lation is mediated downstream of p53 by SCO2 (17).
However, subsequent research has failed to provide evi-
dence of p53 control of SCO2 in both mouse (20) and
human (36) skeletal muscle. The lack of change in SCO2
protein content after 4 wk of training seems consistent with
these findings. Another means of p53’s control of mito-
chondrial respiration is through transcriptional regulation
of AIF, a protein that assists in the assembly of CI (16). Our
results indicate that AIF protein content did not change
after training, consistent with the findings of past re-
search in humans (37). p53 has also been linked with
mitochondrial dynamics (16). In the present study, the
protein content of mitofusin 2 increased after training,
with DRP1 showing a similar trend (P = 0.063), but there
were no significant differences between groups for either
protein. p53 can also regulate mitochondrial transcription
by interacting with TFAM (20, 21), a nuclear-encoded gene
that controls mtDNA transcription and maintenance (13).
Our results indicate that TFAM protein content was un-
changed after training, in agreement with prior findings (5).
This result is also consistent with the hypothesis that mito-
chondrial adaptations and mtDNA transcription depend
on the activation of existing TFAM (5) and its interaction

 with p53 inside the mitochondria (21), rather than the
abundance of TFAM itself.
Similar to p53 protein content and mass-specific
respiration, PHF20 protein content increased only af-
ter SIT. PHF20 is a transcription factor that binds
directly to the p53 promoter and transcriptionally
upregulates (22) and stabilizes (23) p53. Therefore, a
training-intensity–dependent increase in PHF20 pro-
tein may help to explain the increase in p53 protein
only after SIT and suggests that 4 wk of SIT improve
mitochondrial respiration via a mechanism involving
the coordinated up-regulation of the PHF20–p53
pathway. Future investigations of these hypotheses are
warranted.
Mitochondrial respiration and
endurance performance
Mitochondrial respiration has been reported to be the
strongest determinant of TT performance in highly-
trained athletes (4). Consistent with these findings, our
results revealed a significant linear correlation between
pretraining CI+IIP and 20k TT performance across the
29 participants who completed the study. However,
despite being the only training intervention to increase
mitochondrial respiration, SIT did not improve 20k TT
performance after training. This discrepancy between
changes in mitochondrial respiration and endurance
performance is further supported by the lack of corre-
lation between changes in CI+IIP and 20k TT time, and
the subsequent loss of correlation between these 2 pa-
rameters after training. This finding indicates that mi-
tochondrial respiration was not the key mediator of
training-induced changes in endurance performance
for the moderately-trained population in our study.
Nonetheless, SIT may represent an effective way to
boost the oxidative capacity of moderately-trained men,
which, when coupled with other training at lower
intensity, could contribute to improved endurance
performance.
CONCLUSIONS
Our resultsdemonstratethat, in young moderately-trained
men who complete a 4-wk training protocol, training in-
tensity is an important factor that determines changes in
mitochondrial respiration. We provide evidence that as
little as 4 wk of SIT was sufficient to induce improvements
in mitochondrial quality, such as increased mitochondrial-
specific respiration. These results suggest that SIT pro-
motes greater and faster mitochondrial adaptations in
skeletal muscle of young moderately-trained men than
does HIIT and STCT; however, our results and the litera-
ture suggest that physiological and mitochondrial adapta-
tions can occur with longer STCT- or HIIT-like protocols.
We also showed dissociation between changes in mito-
chondrial content and mitochondrial respiration. Our
results indicate that changes in the protein content of PGC-
1a, p53, and PHF20 may be more strongly associated with
training-induced changes in mitochondrial respiration
rather than mitochondrial content, and suggest that these
changes may be mediated by different molecular pathways
or time courses. The present study also highlights the po-
tential role of PHF20 in the regulation of mitochondrial
respiration in humans via the coordinated upregulation of
the PHF20–p53 pathway.
