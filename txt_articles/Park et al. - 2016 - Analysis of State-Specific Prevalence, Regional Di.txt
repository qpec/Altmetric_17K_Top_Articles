Abstract
Objective: To investigate the state-specific prevalence, regional differences, and correlates of 
hookah use among U.S. adults.
Methods: We analyzed the most recent nationally representative data of adults from the National 
Adult 
Tobacco Survey (NATS) 2012–2013 (n = 60 
192). State-specific prevalence of lifetime and cur-
rent hookah use was calculated and mapped. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to 
determine the association between sociodemographic characteristics, regional differences, and 
hookah use.
Results: Among U.S. adults (≥18 years), overall prevalence of lifetime hookah use was 12.3%, 
while current use was 3.9%. Mapping of state-specific prevalence revealed that the West tended 
to have higher rates of use, while the South tended to have lower ones. In the adjusted model, 
we observed that current hookah use was positively associated with younger adults, males, non-
Hispanic adults, those with higher education and income statuses, being single, those living in the 
West, and current cigarette use.
Conclusion: The prevalence of hookah use varies by state, region, and sociodemographic char-
acteristics among adults. Future research, including longitudinal studies, are needed to identify 
geographic and sociodemographic characteristics and trends among hookah users, investigate 
hookah-related health outcomes, and evaluate targeted public health efforts aimed at this emerg-
ing threat.
Implications: This study investigates state-level prevalence, regional differences, and sociodemo-
graphic characteristics of hookah use among U.S. adults, using the most recent NATS. Hookah use 
was positively associated with younger adults and those living in the West. 
This study adds to the 
understanding of the geographic and sociodemographic factors underlying hookah use, which can 
be used to develop much needed evidence-based regulations and programs that are responsive to 
the needs of different risk groups.

Introduction
Hookah, also called a waterpipe, hubble-bubble, shisha, narghile, or 
argileh, is a traditional apparatus for the smoking of tobacco and 
other combustible materials that is popular throughout the Middle 
East, and more recently, throughout the world.1 Hookah use has 
increased rapidly in the United States, especially among adoles-
cents, among whom use has increased by 5.3% from 2011 to 2014, 
although cigarette use has decreased significantly by 6.6% in recent 
years.2 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), the reduction in cigarette consumption might be due to 
the increased use of other forms of tobacco, including hookahs.3 
Hookah creates very large amounts of secondhand smoke, 4,5 and 
hookah smoking is thus likely to affect bystanders, even more than 
cigarette smoking does6,7 while at the same time having significant 
negative effects on those who smoke it themselves.6,8
Studies have found that hookah use is addictive9,10 and causes 
similar health effects11,12 as cigarettes. Hookah smoke contains high 
levels of toxic chemicals, such as carbon monoxide (CO), tar, heavy 
metals, benzene, and other cancer-causing chemicals13,14, and has 
been associated with dramatically greater smoke exposure than cig-
arette smoke.12 Moreover, people who use hookahs inhale substan-
tially more smoke than cigarette smokers.5 Possible adverse health 
outcomes of hookah use include lung cancer,15 periodontal disease,1 
respiratory illnesses,16 and low-birth-weight infants.17 In addition, 
sharing mouthpieces contributes to the spread of infectious diseases, 
such as hepatitis C, tuberculosis, influenza, and herpes.18 Despite 
these negative health effects, hookah smoking is generally perceived 
to be a less harmful, less addictive alternative to cigarettes.19–21
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank 
have reported that comprehensive tobacco control policies are the 
most effective way to curb the tobacco use epidemic, impacting 
both the demand for and supply of tobacco products.22,23 A recent 
review of hookah-related legislation and policies, however, revealed 
that there are very few smoke-free policies at the state and local 
levels that have addressed hookah smoking.20 Additionally, there 
is virtually no legislation in any of the 50 states and the District 
of Columbia that addresses any of the text on hookah packaging 
or the need to provide information on the negative health impacts 
of hookah use either on the packaging or in establishments where 
hookah use is allowed. Existing policies do not necessarily discour-
age current users or directly inform the public about the hazards of 
hookah-related secondhand smoke in other venues (eg homes) and 
do not explicitly reference hookah bars and lounges, leading to vary-
ing interpretations.24
Despite the emerging literature demonstrating adverse health 
consequences of hookah use, little is known about the regional pat-
terns of such use. Also, most studies that have addressed the epide-
miology of hookah use have been international in scope, thereby 
utilizing samples with demographics that are not necessarily repre-
sentative of hookah users in the United States, such as university stu-
dents in other countries25,26 and use as a result of cultural practices 
specific to individual cultures.27,28 Moreover, public policy regarding 
hookah use, advertising and sales lag far behind those existing for 
cigarettes, although they are receiving increased attention at the local 
and federal levels as evidenced by bans on hookah lounges in a num-
ber of cities and the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
report concerning national concerns and policies.29 Assessments of 
the geographic use of hookahs across U.S. states can serve as an 
exploratory tool or a basis for future epidemiological research and 
evidence-based policymaking.
In this study, therefore, we analyzed a nationally representa-
tive sample of U.S. adults to assess the state-specific prevalence 
of hookah use and to determine its association with regional and 
sociodemographic characteristics using the most recent National 
Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS) data. Findings from this research can 
inform interventions focused on reducing hookah use among popu-
lation subgroups in the United States.
Methods
Sample
Data from the cross-sectional, nationally representative NATS 
2012–2013 were analyzed. A detailed description of the NATS meth-
odology is available elsewhere.30 Briefly, the NATS was designed as a 
stratified, national random-digit dialed landline and cell phone sur-
vey of 60 
192 noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 years and older, 
residing in the 50 
U.S. states or the District of Columbia. For the 
2012–2013 survey wave, the response rate to the survey was 44.9% 
(landline, 47.2%; cellular, 36.3%).
The 2012–2013 NATS comprised two sampling frames: one 
consisting of landline telephone users and one consisting of cellu-
lar telephone numbers. Each state consisted of three strata: a listed 
landline stratum, a nonlisted landline stratum, and a cellular phone 
stratum. The samples from each frame were stratified by state to 
provide adequate representation of each state and gather higher 
numbers of completed surveys from states with larger populations. 
The state goals targeted a minimum of 800 completed surveys: 600 
landline (75%) and 200 cell-only (25%) from each state. Thirty 
states targeted more than 800 for 24 
000 of the 60 
000 target pop-
ulation. The top 20 most populous states with a goal above 800 
accounted for the remaining 36 
000 surveys allocated across these 
states in approximate proportion to their population. The number 
of surveys conducted was very close to state goals, with a range of 
97.6%–105.6%.30
Variables
Participants were identified to be current cigarette smokers if they 
answered “yes” to the question, “Have you smoked at least 100 ciga-
rettes in your entire life?” and responded with “every day,” or “some 
days,” to the question, “Do you now smoke cigarettes every day, 
some days or not at all?” Participants who answered “yes” to the 
question, “Have you ever smoked tobacco in a hookah in your entire 
life?” were defined as ever users of hookahs. For current hookah use, 
individuals who responded with “rarely” were also included as cur-
rent users, a practice consistent with previous literature.31–35 As this 
might boost the number of respondents classified as current hookah 
users, and as those who report rarely using hookahs may differ from 
those who smoke every day or some days, subgroup analyses were 
performed for (a) those who rarely smoked (n = 1103) and (b) for 
those who smoked every (n = 20) or some days (n = 149) for a total 
of 169 subjects in this group.
Sociodemographic variables included age (18–24, 25–34, 35–44, 
45–54, 55–64, and 65≥), gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White, 
non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic Asian, Hispanic, and non-His-
panic other), educational attainment (less than high school diploma, 
high school graduate, some college or associate degree, bachelor’s 
degree or higher), annual household income (<$20 
000, $20 
000–
$49 
999, $50 
000–$99 
999, and ≥$100 
000), marital status (mar-
ried/living with a partner, divorced/widowed/separated/single/never 
marry/not living with partner), and U.S. region (Northeast, Midwest,

South, and West). All 50 
U.S. states and the District of Columbia 
were also included in the analyses. Current cigarette smoking sta-
tus also was included as a covariate and characteristics of cigarette 
smokers were also assessed for purposes of comparison.
Statistical Analyses
Data were analyzed using the –survey– module of Stata 14.0 
(StataCorp, College Station, TX) to account for complex sample 
design and responses. The landline data were weighted by prob-
ability of selection of a respondent’s telephone number, nonre-
sponse, number of landlines in the household, and number of 
adults in the household. The cell phone data were weighted to 
adjust for probability of selection of the telephone number and 
nonresponse. To adjust for undercoverage and nonresponse bias, 
final weights were calculated using a raking method, with state, 
age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment, 
and phone category.36
Estimates of lifetime and current hookah use were calculated 
for each state. For lifetime hookah use, state-specific prevalence was 
assessed and mapped by gender. The ArcGIS 10.0 software (ESRI, 
Redlands, CA) was used for GIS mapping. A descriptive analysis of 
all variables included in this study was performed using weighted 
percentages and confidence intervals (CIs). Multivariate logistic 
regression was performed to assess the association between sociode-
mographic characteristics, region, and hookah use. A significance 
level of α = 0.05 was used in the analysis.
Results
For current hookah use, presented results include analyses of individ-
uals who reported using hookah rarely, on some days, or every day. 
Not shown are separate analyses for (a) those who rarely use hookah 
and (b) those who use hookah on some days or every day, as results 
were virtually identical to those analyses conducted with “current 
hookah use” including those who reported smoking hookah rarely, 
on some days, or every day. Among U.S. adults, the overall preva-
lence of lifetime hookah use was 12.3% (95% CI: 11.9–12.7), while 
the rate of current use was 3.9% (95% CI: 3.6–4.1). Table 1 presents 
estimates of current and lifetime hookah use among U.S. adults for 
each state, categorized by the four geographic regions. The preva-
lence varied substantially by state. Estimates of current hookah use 
ranged from 0.8% (95% CI: 0.2–2.6) in Mississippi to 10.3% (95% 
CI: 5.7–17.9) in the District of Columbia. For lifetime hookah use, 
the prevalence ranged from 4.4% (95% CI: 2.6–7.1) in Mississippi 
to 27.1% (95% CI: 20.8–34.6) in the District of Columbia (Table 1). 
Lifetime hookah use was more prevalent among males than females 
in all 50 states and the District of Columbia and the geographic 
distribution of use by gender varied somewhat by state (Table 1). 
Among males, the highest prevalence of lifetime hookah use was in 
the District of Columbia (36.3%), followed by Nevada (24.3%), 
New Mexico (23.6%), and California (22.2%). Among females, the 
highest rates were observed in the District of Columbia (20.0%), 
Arizona (14.4%), Nevada (13.6%), and Colorado (13.1%).
For both current and lifetime hookah use, the West tended to 
have higher rates, while the South tended to have lower ones. The 
maps in Figures 1 and 2 show the weighted percentage of lifetime 
and current hookah use with darker shading indicating a higher 
prevalence of hookah use. Classifications are based on quintiles. 
Nine states had rates of current hookah use greater than or equal 
to 5%: Arizona, California, Colorado, the District of Columbia, 
Idaho, Indiana, Nevada, Utah, and Virginia. Seven states had rates 
of lifetime use greater than or equal to 15%: Arizona, California, 
Colorado, the District of Columbia, Nevada, New Mexico, and 
Oregon. The distributions of the prevalence of current and lifetime 
hookah use appeared to be similar.
Table 2 describes the sociodemographic characteristics of current 
and lifetime hookah users, and how these characteristics were inde-
pendently associated with hookah use. Cigarette use was included 
for comparison. In the multivariate logistic regression model, signifi-
cant regional differences were observed, with adults in the West hav-
ing increased levels of both lifetime (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6; 95% CI: 
1.4–1.9) and current (OR = 1.4; 95% CI: 1.1–1.8) use of hookahs 
compared with adults in the Northeast. Conversely, adults living in 
the West were less likely to be current cigarette smokers than those 
living in the Northeast (OR = 0.8; p < .05).
A number of characteristics of individuals were also associated 
with hookah use, and the associations were similar for lifetime and 
current hookah use. Age was significantly associated (p < .001) with 
hookah use, with adults younger than 35 being more likely to use 
them and adults older than 44 less likely. Of note, young adults aged 
18 to 24 years were more likely to be current hookah smokers than 
those aged 35 to 44 years (OR = 15.1; 95% CI: 10.8–21.2), and less 
likely to be current cigarette smokers (OR = 0.6; 95% CI: 0.5–0.8).
Being male and being single were also associated with increased 
current hookah use (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.3–1.8, OR = 2.0; 95% 
CI: 1.6–2.4, respectively). Similarly, current cigarette smokers were 
also more likely to be male and single (OR = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.4–
1.6, OR = 1.3; 95% CI: 1.2–1.5, respectively) (Figures 3 and 4). 
Non-Hispanic Black adults were negatively associated with both 
current hookah use and current cigarette use compared with White 
adults (OR = 0.4; 95% CI: 0.2–0.6; OR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.7–0.9, 
respectively). In contrast to current cigarette use, individuals with 
a Bachelor’s degree or higher and those who earned more than 
$100 
000 in annual household income were more likely to be cur-
rent hookah users (OR = 1.8; 95% CI: 1.4–2.3, OR = 1.5; 95% 
CI: 1.2–1.9, respectively) and less likely to be current cigarette users 
(OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.3–0.4, OR = 0.5; 95% CI: 0.4–0.5, respec-
tively). Positive associations were observed between current cigarette 
smoking and lifetime and current hookah use. Individuals who were 
current cigarette smokers were more likely to be current hookah 
users than those who were not current cigarette smokers (OR = 3.9; 
95% CI: 3.2–4.7).
Discussion
We investigated the regional and state-level prevalence of lifetime 
and current hookah use, and assessed the association between char-
acteristics of individuals and hookah use, using the most recent 
nationally representative sample of adults from the United States 
with such information. The results demonstrate that the prevalence 
of current and lifetime hookah use varied substantially by state and 
region, with higher rates of use being reported in the West, although 
Washington DC had the highest prevalence of both lifetime and cur-
rent use. In addition, a number of characteristics of individuals were 
independently associated with both current and lifetime use, with 
the characteristics among individuals in each hookah-use group 
being quite similar and markedly different from those of cigarette 
smokers. Current hookah use was positively associated with living 
in the West, younger adults, males, those with higher education and 
income statuses, single status, and current cigarette smoking.

This study builds on past research, demonstrating significant 
changes over a very short time period. Compared with a recently pub-
lished study37 that used data from the 2009–2010 NATS, the preva-
lence rates for both lifetime and current hookah use have increased. 
Reported lifetime hookah use has increased from 9.8% to 12.3%, 
and current hookah use has increased from 1.5% to 3.3% in this 
very short timespan. Variations in rates of use by state also changed 
over this period. The highest prevalence of lifetime hookah use, 
which remained the same, was in the District of Columbia. However, 
the lowest prevalence of lifetime hookah use was in Mississippi, 
replacing West Virginia. Data presented here are also consistent with 
another prior study of 105 
012 students from 152 
U.S. universities 
that found hookah use was highest in the West.38
The current study also found that increased lifetime and cur-
rent hookah use persisted in the West even after adjusting for mul-
tiple confounders—which Salloum et al.37 did not examine in the 
2009–2010 wave. This suggests that the increased prevalence in the 
West may not be due to commonly studied sociodemographic fac-
tors such as race/ethnicity, education, or income, but may be related 
to as yet unmeasured or unidentified variables. Due to the paucity

of state-level research on hookah environment characteristics such 
as number of hookah bars, methods of advertising, and comprehen-
sive reports on regulations, it is difficult to determine what might 
be causing the increase in prevalence in the West. More research is 
needed to identify such potential causal factors and to create appro-
priate interventions to address them.
This study also identified several sociodemographic correlates 
associated with hookah use in adults. Results show that males are 
more likely to use hookah than females, a finding corroborated by 
the study by Salloum et al. However, it should be noted that a recent 
paper by Villanti et al.39 found identical rates of use among males 
and females, albeit in a sample restricted to younger adults aged 18 
to 24 years. In the present study, being married or having a partner 
was found to be negatively associated with hookah use. Although 
this was not studied by Salloum et al., being married has been shown 
to be associated with reduced hookah use in a different study of

U.S. Air Force military recruits40 and has been linked to decreased 
cigarette use.41
In this study, higher income and education were positively asso-
ciated with hookah use, in contrast to cigarette smoking, which is 
well recognized to be more common among those of lower socio-
economic status.42 This highlights the fact that different factors 
seem to be associated with cigarette and hookah use. These findings 
are also consistent with a recent study that found that high school 
students with higher parental education status and higher income 
were more likely to be hookah users.43 The cause or causes of this 
finding are, we believe, very important and currently unexplained. 
The diffusion of hookah use in the United States is coinciding with 
the proliferation of hookah bars.44 The use of these venues is often 
quite costly, which may be related to the fact that they are more 
affordable to higher income groups or more of a status symbol and a 
trending social activity among more affluent individuals. This clearly

contrasts with cigarette smoking in the fact that cigarette use cur-
rently is stigmatized among the same demographic.33
Our study also showed that younger age was associated with 
greater hookah use, as has been found in other studies. In a national 
survey, the CDC reported a significant increase in hookah use among 
middle school- and high school-aged youth.45 Among high school 
students, current hookah use significantly increased from 4.1% to 
9.4% from 2011 to 2014, although current cigarette use decreased 
from 15.8% to 9.2%45. In addition, a university-based study of 
young adults found that the prevalence of hookah use was 28.4%, 
whereas 19.6% of the participants smoked cigarettes at the time of 
the study46.
Studies have suggested that increased hookah use among younger 
adults is due mainly to harm perception, attitude, and social norms 
regarding its acceptability.47,48 Compared with cigarette smok-
ing, college students tend to perceive hookah use as less harmful, 
addictive, and detrimental, and as having higher social approval.33,49 
A longitudinal cohort study of university students indicated a signifi-
cant association between positive attitudes toward hookah use and 
increased odds of initiation.50 Additionally, these misconceptions of 
hookah use may alter the social norms of other peers, potentially 
contributing to the increasing trend of hookah use among younger 
adults. Younger adults are more likely to use the internet or social 
media, such as Twitter and YouTube, and to share photos of their 
hookah use, including at bars and social events, potentially prompt-
ing peers who have never tried hookah to initiate use.51–53
Several limitations of this study are deserving of note. First, 
since the analyses were based on self-reported data, recall and social 
desirability biases may have affected the results. Second, we ana-
lyzed cross-sectional data; therefore, it was not possible to assess 
the causality of relationships or to perform long-term trend analy-
ses. Additional longitudinal studies are essential to assess risk fac-
tors associated with hookah use and how they may be changing, 
changing regional variations in use, as well as potential health risks. 
Third, the majority (86.8%) of the sample of current hookah users 
reported “rarely” using hookah. However, accounting for the rarely 
group does not diminish the findings of this study, because even 
using hookah rarely might represent initiation of hookah use, as well 
as cause potential health risks at both the individual and popula-
tion levels. Fourth, owing to the limitations of the questionnaire, we 
could not account for lifestyle factors, such as alcohol consumption, 
licit and illicit substance use, psychological factors, and religiosity, 
which have been found to be associated with hookah use in other 
studies.43,54,55 Although we described the overall state-level preva-
lence, we were not able to compare rural and urban differences and/
or population characteristics across the states. Lastly, the paucity of 
information available concerning state and local regulations regard-
ing hookah bars, use of hookahs in public outdoor spaces, hookah 
and shisha sales, and use of hookah-related advertising limits our 
ability to correlate geographic usage rates with public policies.
Despite these limitations, the data presented provide an 
estimate of the state-based prevalence of hookah use in the 
50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia, using the most recent 
nationally representative NATS data, and describe the individual 
and regional characteristics associated with lifetime and current 
hookah use. Since the characteristics of hookah users are different 
to those of cigarette smokers, the findings of this study should be 
useful for guiding the development of strategies to prevent hookah 
use, including those aimed at marketing and at regulating emerg-
ing alternative tobacco products. Another consideration that 
should be addressed in future studies is that of nonsmokers being 
exposed to secondhand hookah smoke. Hookah venues, including 
bars, lounges, restaurants, and cafés, are prevalent around univer-
sity campuses and provide a gathering place for college students. 
Thus, the effect of such venues on the health of nonsmokers is also 
a significant consideration
Furthermore, although several states, as well as the District of 
Columbia regulate cigarette smoking in public places and work-
places, the Smoke-Free Air Act is often not applicable to hookah 
bars. Hookah bars have been able to take advantage of this exemp-
tion in certain states, often times creating unsafe environments with 
minimal ventilation. It is thus left up to local governments and 
organizations to advocate for increased awareness of this pressing 
health issue. Analysis of potential policy options to decrease hookah 
use and exposure has demonstrated that banning hookah bars 
would not only be politically infeasible but would also not signifi-
cantly decrease the prevalence of hookah use.56 However, it would be 
possible to impose stricter regulations on hookah bars and hookah 
packaging that increase the visibility of the harmful nature of the 
product as has been done for cigarettes.57,58 Given the existing state-
level autonomy in developing hookah sensitive regulations, continu-
ous monitoring of state-level hookah-related policies and prevalence 
of use could help explicate “what works” within the U.S. context 
at the state level. Such monitoring can help guide the development, 
implementation, and evaluation of evidence-based targeted interven-
tions for the prevention of hookah use that are responsive to the 
state-level policy and regulatory context.
