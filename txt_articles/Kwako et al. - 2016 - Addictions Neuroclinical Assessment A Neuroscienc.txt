Abstract
This paper proposes a heuristic framework for an Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) 
that incorporates key functional domains derived from the neurocircuitry of addiction. We review 
how addictive disorders (AD) are presently diagnosed, and the need for new neuroclinical 
measures to differentiate patients who meet clinical criteria for addiction to the same agent while 
differing in etiology, prognosis and treatment response. The need for a better understanding of the 
mechanisms provoking and maintaining addiction, as evidenced by the limitations of current 
treatments and within-diagnosis clinical heterogeneity, is articulated. In addition, recent changes in 
the nosology of AD, challenges to current classification systems, and prior attempts to subtype 
individuals with AD are described. Complementary initiatives, including the Research Domain 
Criteria (RDoC) project, which have established frameworks for the neuroscience of psychiatric 
disorders, are discussed. Three domains, executive function, incentive salience, and negative 
emotionality, tied to different phases in the cycle of addiction, form the core functional elements of 
AD. Measurement of these domains in epidemiologic, genetic, clinical, and treatment studies will 
provide the underpinnings for an understanding of cross-population and temporal variation in 
addictions, shared mechanisms in addictive disorders, impact of changing environmental 
influences, and gene identification. Finally, we show that it is practical to implement such a deep

 Introduction
The problem of etiologic and functional heterogeneity among patients addicted to the same 
agent is not new. It has long been recognized that these common diseases are etiologically 
heterogeneous, and that dichotomous affected/unaffected classifications fail to capture 
severity and distinctiveness of addictive disorders (AD). A revolution in understanding the 
neurobiologic basis of addiction has not been translated into the clinic. Translation of 
neuroscience to practice would identify the etiologic factors and functional outcomes that 
unify people addicted to different agents and that differentiate people addicted to the same 
agent. Moreover, the lack of assessments of these neurobiologic domains in people has 
impeded genetic, ecologic, and clinical translational research. Changes in the classification 
of AD, have not, arguably, advanced this nosology appreciably in several decades.
Attempts to identify meaningful subtypes of AD have predominately focused on alcohol use 
disorders (AUD). Jellinek (1), Cloninger, Babor, Lesch, and others (see (2) for a 
comprehensive review), have clinically subclassified alcoholism. Other addictive agents, 
including cocaine (3, 4), opioids (5), club drugs (6), and cannabis (7, 8), have been the focus 
of similar efforts. Despite this work, there remains little consensus in the field regarding 
subtypes of various AD. We propose this lack of agreement is because classification 
schemes have been limited by measures available.
This review proposes a framework and rationale for an Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment 
(ANA). It is our aim to establish such a framework and rationale with present knowledge of 
the neurobiologic basis of addiction, gleaned from humans and model organisms. Three 
main neurofunctional domains, executive function, incentive salience, and negative 
emotionality, should be assessed in patients with addictions, including behavioral addictions 
(“process” addictions as defined by the American Society of Addiction Medicine, e.g. 
gambling) and in individuals at risk, for purposes of better understanding the heterogeneity 
of AD and eventually to improve the nosology. Other measures of exposure to addictive 
agents, and use (e.g., impulsive, habitual, and compulsive) and related phenomena, genetics, 
and agent-specific outcomes would be closely integrated with measures of neuroscience 
domains whose importance we hypothesize transcends any particular addictive agent.
 Changes in Nosology
The diagnosis of AD has shifted over time while adhering to a focus on clinical presentation 
rather than etiology. This emphasis has not been without benefit. The ability to diagnose AD 
by clinical criteria has provided a reliable foundation for the practice of addiction medicine.

 It has also been a springboard for neuroscience and genetic studies and clinical trials that 
have yielded insights on AD, e.g., for neural mechanisms (9), genetics (10), and treatment 
(11).
In the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(DSM-5; 20) AD are grounded in clinical-life outcomes both because of the relevance of 
symptom-based diagnoses as indicators of impairment and need for intervention, but also 
because of lack of evidence-based alternatives. Properly assessed using DSM symptoms, AD 
have high inter-rater reliabilities (13); furthermore, factor analyses show that on a statistical 
basis they are internally coherent or “valid’ (14). These virtues, while important, are 
insufficient. A diagnosis with high inter-rater reliability is not necessarily useful if the 
diagnosis is heterogeneous. AD diagnosis is based on endorsement of symptoms in several 
domains of life impact. In contrast with most medical diagnoses, the nosology and diagnosis 
of AD is outcome-based rather than process-based. Such a deficiency is shared by other 
psychiatric disorders, as discussed (15). In identifying a research agenda for the then-under 
development DSM-5, Charney and colleagues outlined the need for a neuroscience-based 
framework to foster development of psychiatric nosology based on pathophysiology, rather 
than clinical presentation.
 Translating etiology into clinical practice, across clinical diagnostic 
categories—By way of comparison, a diagnosis of cancer affecting any particular organ is 
diagnosed using cellular, genetic, molecular, and imaging measures, combined with clinical 
history. Progress in treatment and prevention, e.g., the utility of trastuzumab (a monoclonal 
antibody interfering with the HER2/neu receptor) in the treatment of certain breast cancers 
(16) or the ability of the BRCA1 (a gene producing tumor-suppressing proteins) genotype to 
predict enhanced risk of breast cancer (17), has occurred because of integration of these 
measures with clinical history. The clinical observations are irreplaceable but do not 
themselves replace the need for physiologic data, in the form of an imaging, genetic, or 
molecular measure.
Addiction diagnoses reimagined and informed by mechanistically relevant measures, 
whether from neuroimaging, genetics, and/or epigenetics, are at present precluded by lack of 
deep data on individuals with AD and others at risk. Pharmacotherapies to treat addictions 
provide one example of how present nosology impacts outcomes. For example, there are 
three FDA-approved medications to treat alcoholism: acamprosate (approved 2004), 
naltrexone (approved 1994), and disulfiram (approved 1951). Behavioral treatments 
including cognitive behavior therapy, motivational enhancement therapy, 12-step facilitated 
therapy, and behavioral couples/family therapies also have efficacy (18, 19). To a limited 
extent, these behavioral treatments and medications appear to target different 
neurobiological components of the addiction cycle, e.g., naltrexone is an opioid antagonist 
and is hypothesized to target the rewarding effects of alcohol (20, 21), while acamprosate 
antagonizes NMDA function and metabotropic glutamate receptors and is hypothesized to 
target “craving” associated with alcohol acute and protracted withdrawal (22-24). A 
mechanistically-informed nosology may enable identification of improved treatment options 
and better matching to treatments.

 Cloninger’s tridimensional personality theory for AUD, with three corresponding 
neurofunctional systems (25), was one of the first efforts to reimagine an addictions 
diagnosis on the basis of process and to propose a method for measuring the relevant 
domains. A main limitation of Cloninger’s scheme was that only a personality questionnaire 
was available to access the target processes, and, as will be seen later, subsequent addictions 
neuroscience investigations over the past two decades have led to a somewhat different 
conceptualization of the neurofunctional domains involved in addiction.
The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) (26) initiative from the National Institute of Mental 
Health (NIMH) is a broad framework relevant to multiple psychiatric disorders. RDoC is 
intended to advance the goal of a neuroscience-based research framework for psychiatric 
diseases (12). Recently, an RDoC framework modified for alcoholism, Alcohol Addiction 
Research Domain Criteria (AARDoC), was proposed (27). Both RDoC and AARDoc, like 
Cloninger’s tridimensional personality structure, are research frameworks within which 
specific functional domains can be positioned and prioritized. Building on AARDoC, we 
propose a clinical framework for the assessment of addictions: ANA. ANA will provide the 
heuristic framework for measures of neurobiologic/neuropsychologic functions in AD and 
begin to address the practical problem of specifying a panel of instruments that may be 
widely used by researchers.
 The need for ANA
Addictive disorders are a public health crisis. The 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and 
Health (NSDUH) estimated that 20.3 million adults had a substance use disorder (SUD), 
approximately 8.5% of the population (28). Some 1.3 million adolescents, or 5.2% of the 
U.S. adolescent population, had a SUD (28). Behavioral addictions are similarly pervasive; 
between one and three percent of U.S. individuals engage in pathological gambling, with 
high rates of comorbid psychiatric disorders among those who do (29). Availability of 
treatments for AD is limited, e.g., approximately 80% of individuals with alcoholism (30) 
and close to 90% percent of individuals with pathological gambling do not receive treatment 
(31). While the FDA-approved medications discussed above have efficacy, less than four 
percent of individuals use any medication for an alcohol use disorder (32). Because of 
advances in technology and our understanding of neuromechanisms of addiction, meshing 
neuroscience-based assessments with clinical measures appears feasible and imperative. 
Such an approach will build upon existing treatment options to find ones that are more 
targeted towards the individual.
 Similar Initiatives
For addictions and other psychiatric disorders, partially overlapping conceptual frameworks 
and approaches are in place and underway worldwide. Knowledge gained from these may be 
brought to bear in designing ANA. We have identified five of particular relevance: RDoC 
(26), Impaired Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA) (33), IMAGEN (34), 
PhenX (35), and Cognitive Neuroscience Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in 
Schizophrenia (CNTRICS) (36). We discuss each briefly, and compare the initiatives in 
Table 1.

 RDoC originated as part of the NIMH 2008 strategic plan. The goal of RDoC is to create a 
research framework for studying psychiatric disorders. Grounded in neuroscience research, 
this framework spans five domains: Negative Valence Systems, Positive Valence Systems, 
Cognitive Systems, Systems for Social Processes, and Arousal and Regulatory Systems. The 
domains are further organized by units of analysis, ranging from genes to paradigms (see 
http://www.nimh.nih.gov/research-priorities/rdoc/research-domain-criteria-matrix.shtml for 
an overview of the RDoC matrix). ANA captures information in three of five RDoC 
domains. A major difference between the two is that RDoC serves as a research framework 
rather than a clinical framework. Many publications have expanded on conceptual and 
methodological implications of RDoC, e.g. (26, 37-40).
iRISA, as described by Goldstein and Volkow (33, 41), identifies disruptions in neural 
circuits that relate to AD, with an emphasis on response inhibition and salience attribution. 
The iRISA model presents an addiction cycle of intoxication, bingeing, withdrawal, and 
craving, and identifies the underlying neural disruptions with an emphasis on 
neuroadaptations and maladaptations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) associated with each 
phase of the process. The framework presented in iRISA, and emphasis on disruptions in 
PFC function for AD, are relevant to all three of the domains that will be assessed in ANA.
The IMAGEN consortium, including collaborators from multiple European nations, has as 
its goal the identification of neurally-based predictors of increased risk for developing AD 
(see: http://www.imagen-europe.com). IMAGEN has recruited approximately 2,000 
adolescents, who are being longitudinally followed. The standard neuroimaging battery 
includes measures of reward, emotion recognition, response inhibition, and general 
cognition. Other measures include neuropsychological testing and blood collection for 
genomic analyses. Publications using the IMAGEN sample range from data analytic 
methods (42, 43) to imaging-genetic findings related to reward, oxytocin function and others 
(44-46) and behavioral findings (47, 48). Unlike RDoC, IMAGEN does not seek to establish 
a framework of neurobiologic domains, but identifies useful assessments.
PhenX seeks to standardize the measurement of 21 domains including environmental 
exposures, demographics, and substance use (http://www.phenxtoolkit.org). PhenX was 
launched in 2007 by RTI International, with funding from the National Human Genome 
Research Institute. The measures were developed with input from researchers in academia, 
government, and scientific organizations. The PhenX toolkit includes a group of assessments 
specifically focused on substance abuse and addiction (SAA), identified with support from 
domain experts and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The PhenX 
Real world Implementation and Sharing (RISING) consortium is a significant step forward 
in the practical application of PhenX measures (49). PhenX publications have been largely 
focused on implementation of PhenX measures (35, 50-53), including a recent publication 
on the commonality of findings in different addictive disorders across measures of addiction 
(54).
CNTRICS began with the primary goal of identifying neuroscience-based treatments to 
improve cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, with principal investigators at the 
University of California, Davis, and University of Washington, along with a steering

 committee of scientists from academia, government, and AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical 
company. Extensive details about CNTRICS may be found at its website: http://
cntrics.ucdavis.edu/index.shtml. The constructs include working memory, long-term 
memory, executive control, social/emotional processing, attention, and perception. The 
CNTRICS group has published extensively on the construct and task selection process, e.g.
(55-58). Further, the Cognitive Neuroscience Test Reliability and Clinical Applications for 
Schizophrenia (CNTRACS; http://cntracs.ucdavis.edu/) consortium has grown out of 
CNTRICS as a way to test the practicality and applicability of the measures identified.
 ANA Domains
The ANA domains are derived from a conceptual framework in which AD lead to elements 
of impulsivity and compulsivity dysfunction. Three functional domains, executive function, 
incentive salience, and negative emotionality, are involved. Changes in these domains can be 
staged, heuristically, as: Binge-Intoxication (reward and incentive salience, habits, 
representing the incentive salience domain), Withdrawal-Negative Affect (stress and 
negative emotional states, including but not limited to withdrawal, representing the negative 
emotionality domain) and Preoccupation-Anticipation (executive function) (59). It is notable 
that a recent review (60), identified three major domains of neurofunctional impairment 
related to gambling disorder, namely loss of control, craving/withdrawal, neglect of other 
areas of life. These domains closely parallel the three ANA domains.
 Executive Function—The executive function domain broadly includes processes 
related to organizing behavior towards future goals (61). Although including the totality of 
executive functions under ANA is infeasible, certain subdomains of executive function bear 
particular relevance for addictions. As described (61), we focus on executive function 
processes related to the cross-temporal organization of behavior, including attention, 
response inhibition, planning, working memory, behavioral flexibility, and valuation of 
future events. Taken together, these processes provide a reasonably comprehensive overview 
of those executive function systems disrupted in addictions.
Dysfunction in these processes is well-documented among individuals addicted to various 
agents. Deficits in attention have been shown among individuals addicted to alcohol (62), 
cocaine (63), and nicotine (64). Response inhibition is impaired among heroin (65) and 
methamphetamine (66) addicts and in pathological gamblers (67). Further, alterations in 
planning are evident among those addicted to nicotine (67) and opioids (68); disruptions in 
working memory are evident in alcohol (62), cocaine (63), and cannabis (69) addiction. 
Finally, behavioral flexibility is notably impaired among those addicted to cocaine (70) and 
amphetamine (71), and deficits in valuation of future events are well-documented in alcohol 
(72) and nicotine (73) addiction.
Dysfunction in executive function, producing loss of top-down control in the frontal cortex, 
is etiological in driving many of these deficits, and such top-down control directly impacts 
on incentive salience and impulsivity in the binge-intoxication stage presumably via 
glutamatergic connections to the basal ganglia and impacts on negative emotional states via 
glutamatergic connections to the extended amygdala (9).

  Incentive Salience—Alterations in incentive salience are also well-documented among 
individuals with AD and have been intimately linked to the circuitry of the basal ganglia. 
The construct of incentive salience can be defined as a psychological process that transforms 
the perception of stimuli, imbuing them with salience, and making them attractive. Incentive 
salience as a construct has its roots in incentive motivation (74) and conditioned 
reinforcement (75), and was hypothesized to be linked directly to phasic activation of the 
mesocorticolimbic dopamine system (76). A series of studies were conducted in which 
investigators recorded from dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area in primates 
during repeated presentation of rewards and presentation of stimuli associated with reward. 
Dopamine cells fired upon the first exposure to a novel reward, but repeated exposure to 
dopamine caused the neurons to stop firing upon reward consumption and fire instead when 
they were exposed to stimuli that were predictive of the reward (77).
With respect to measures of various components of incentive salience, the neural responses 
of addicted individuals are altered to both cue and non-cue targets (78-80), with increased 
craving for substances in response to related cues (81, 82), and differences in reward 
learning (83). Importantly, cue reactivity to addictive agents is associated with increased risk 
for relapse (81, 84-86), and there are strong positive correlations between cue response and 
attentional bias (78, 87-89).
The phasic dopaminergic activation that drives incentive salience is hypothesized to also 
engage habit formation and compulsive-like responding for addictive agents via activation of 
cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic loops (90, 91).
 Negative Emotionality—Increases in negative emotional responses to various stimuli 
and overall self-reported dysphoria are found in individuals with AD (92, 93). Clinicians and 
researchers have long considered the notion that reduction of negative affect may be a 
primary driver for excessive consumption of addictive agents (described alternately as self-
medication or tension-reduction). Indeed, hypohedonia is widely documented as a clinical 
feature of AD (94-98) and is highly associated with increased craving for drugs of abuse 
(99) and relapse (100), which may contribute significantly to the increased salience of cues 
associated with addictive agents, and loss of interest in others, e.g., (97). A complete 
assessment of reward constructs must include measurement of hypohedonia (101).
Another key component of the negative emotional states associated with the withdrawal-
negative affect stage of the addiction cycle is the engagement of the brain stress systems 
including both the hypothalamic –pituitary-adrenal axis and extrahypothalamic systems 
(102). The brain stress systems include such neurotransmitter systems as corticotropin 
releasing factor, dynorphin, norepinephrine, hypocretin (orexin), substance P, and 
vasopressin. Equally compelling is evidence for dysregulation of the brain anti-stress 
systems such as neuropeptide Y, nociception, endocannabinoids and oxytocin. Increased 
activity in brain stress systems and decreased activity in brain anti-stress systems are 
hypothesized to significantly contribute to negative emotionality (102).

  “Omic” information capture in ANA
ANA is focused on capture of measures of three main neurofunctional domains, however, 
modern “omic” technologies enable the simultaneous capture of information relevant to 
these domains as well as information on comprehensive genetic, molecular, or 
neurofunctional variation, depending on the different technologies. To analyze a gene, or 
given set of genes, or to study their epigenetic control, it is often more cost effective, and 
informative, to use an “omic” sequencing- or array-based technology.
Although individual genes contribute a small proportion of the variance in development of 
addictions, they may still contribute understanding of the mechanisms leading to AD. For 
this reason, genetic sampling should be a standard, but ancillary part of ANA. The present 
importance of ANA for neuroassessment of addictions should not be overestimated, but the 
future importance of genetics for understanding heterogeneity within AD cannot be 
overestimated. Identifying genetic variants underlying phenotypic differences will maximize 
the utility of ANA, as will collection of DNA samples and genotyping with a one million 
marker array or similar tool. Further, analysis of changes in transcriptome, including 
microRNAs, and measurements of epigenetic changes in DNA and chromatin, may be 
critical for understanding neuroadaptations associated with heavy substance use (103). The 
goal is to use such changes as indices of function of molecular networks. It would be 
important to assess these changes in the context of longitudinal and/or large cross-sectional 
studies in which exposures and correlates of molecular responses are measured.
If feasible, exome sequencing should be performed. Whole genome SNP arrays enable 
comprehensive analysis for effects of common alleles of moderate or large effect. Most of 
these SNPs will not be strong predictors of individual outcome but may be key in 
understanding outcome, e.g., alcohol metabolic gene variants that predict alcohol-induced 
flushing, alcoholism risk, and, in moderate drinkers, esophageal cancer (104). Although 
pharmacogenetics is in early stages of research, progress is being made in identifying 
variants that predict clinical success (105, 106). For example, a common OPRM1 
polymorphism predicts response of alcoholic patients to naltrexone (107), and via reward 
(108) although the results are mixed (109). Such analyses will allow ANA datasets to be 
combined with other samples that may only have available the clinical diagnosis, but with 
similar genomic analyses.
A critical aspect of ANA is use of neuroimaging. The use of positron emission tomography 
(PET) scanning has been essential to elucidating the role of dopamine in various AD, e.g. 
(110, 111). To significantly advance the nosology and treatment of addictions, we should use 
neuroimaging technologies that enable multidimensional information capture to understand 
the mechanisms driving these disorders. ANA will include functional MRI-based domain-
specific assessments, along with imaging-based measures of brain structure (e.g. volume, 
morphometry, white matter integrity) and function, e.g., to assess differences in resting state 
functional connectivity identified in alcohol dependent patients (112). The salience of 
neuroimaging to ANA is underscored by recent imaging-genetics findings suggesting, for 
example, differences in neural response to alcohol cues as a function of genotype (113) and 
genetic modulation of neural connectivity related to nicotine addiction (114) and of resting 
state functional connectivity in AUD (115).

 As mentioned, many measures specific to a specific addictive agent, including behavioral 
addictions, or to particular exposures and outcomes, would be ancillary to ANA. Guided by 
clinical problems, ANA should incorporate other measures of function and predisposition 
that are not included within the primary domains, but vital to the etiology and treatment of 
AD, e.g., habitual or compulsive use of an addictive agent. There are important distinctions 
in process and outcome between different addictive agents, and even for the same addictive 
agent within different individuals. A virtue of applying the same measures across different 
addictive disorders, including behavioral addictions, and in people with different exposures 
or at different points in the clinical course of addiction, is to better understand unifying 
mechanisms and variation at baseline and following maladaptive change. A schematic of the 
ANA domains and relevant ancillary assessment domains (Figure 1) illustrates the 
importance of core neuroassessment and the roles of other measures to improve the depth, 
breadth, and specificity of characterization of the individual patient. A comprehensive, 
although not final, list of potential measures, organized by domain, appears in Table 2. This 
battery would be supplemented by additional measures not included within the three 
domains but important for understanding AD, including features of agent use and outcomes, 
e.g., the Addiction Severity Index (116), Timeline Follow-Back (117), important aspects of 
personality, e.g., the NEO-PI-R (118), and environment, e.g., the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality 
Index (119), the Inventory of Socially Supportive Behaviors (120). A graphic depicting the 
process of multidimensional information capture to data analysis to improved diagnosis 
appears in Figure 2.
Lastly, practical considerations regarding the implementation of ANA must be considered. 
Given the breadth of potential assessments, a comprehensive battery would take 
approximately 10 hours. Many of the measures could be collected in any setting with access 
to a laptop computer, although the MRI would require specialized facilities. We have made 
efforts to consider measures that may be attained free or at relatively little cost; the largest 
cost involved would be the use of MRI. Depending on resources, these may be obtained at a 
local academic or hospital setting. Additional costs include data analysis and interpretation. 
A range of ~3,000 to ~5,000 per individual seems feasible and, if resulting in significantly 
improved prognosis, well worth the investment.
 ANA Summary
A few final points about these domains and their relevance for ANA bear mention. First, 
although we have highlighted significant positive findings in each domain, there is 
considerable variability in the literature. Not all individuals with AD evidence disruptions in 
the three primary domains. This variability is symptomatic of the need to systematically 
understand the heterogeneity within AD. Second, although presented independently, there is 
considerable overlap and interactions between domains at multiple levels of analysis. One of 
the most prominent examples is the relevance of PFC dysfunction for various aspects of AD 
(41). These disruptions underlie deficits in executive function, emotion regulation, and 
reward modulation, not surprising given the neurocircuitry connections (121). These 
domains do not comprise the totality of disturbances related to addiction, but serve as a 
useful starting framework for further exploration. Later studies might expand upon, known

 differences in alcohol response, e.g., those related to acute tolerance (122), and in responses 
to other drugs, whether of pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic origin.
Finally, several factors are challenges for application of ANA, including the magnitude of 
the problem of addiction, complexity of causation, and changing nature of problems that 
patients with AD experience over time. Furthermore, a broad combination of collaborations 
and partnerships in academia, government, and private industry will be needed to realize its 
advantages. This review has the more modest goal of providing a heuristic framework for 
ANA, with some evaluation of practicality. Given the multifactorial nature of AD, changing 
nature of exposure and response of human populations to addictive agents, anticipated 
development of new methods for treatment and prevention, and development of new, 
transformative technologies, we do not anticipate that any one functional domain or imaging 
or genetic predictor will resolve the heterogeneity of AD or be sufficient to characterize an 
individual patient. Rather, it is our goal that by collecting multidimensional information and 
focusing on a limited number of functional domains, our understanding of the mechanisms 
of addiction can be improved and prevention/treatment can be better targeted. Identifying the 
major domains underlying AD and how the profile of vulnerability to each domain varies 
among individuals, and over time, not only will be vital to understand the heterogeneity of 
the disorder, but will also enable us to tailor treatment more effectively to the individual.
