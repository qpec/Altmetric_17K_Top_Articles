Abstract
Influenza A virus (IAV) infection can be severe or even lethal in toddlers, the elderly and
patients with certain medical conditions. Infection of apparently healthy individuals nonethe-
less accounts for many severe disease cases and deaths, suggesting that viruses with
increased pathogenicity co-circulate with pandemic or epidemic viruses. Looking for poten-
tial virulence factors, we have identified a polymerase PA D529N mutation detected in a
fatal IAV case, whose introduction into two different recombinant virus backbones, led to
reduced defective viral genomes (DVGs) production. This mutation conferred low induction
of antiviral response in infected cells and increased pathogenesis in mice. To analyze the
association between low DVGs production and pathogenesis in humans, we performed a
genomic analysis of viruses isolated from a cohort of previously healthy individuals who suf-
fered highly severe IAV infection requiring admission to Intensive Care Unit and patients
with fatal outcome who additionally showed underlying medical conditions. These viruses
were compared with those isolated from a cohort of mild IAV patients. Viruses with fewer
DVGs accumulation were observed in patients with highly severe/fatal outcome than in
those with mild disease, suggesting that low DVGs abundance constitutes a new virulence
pathogenic marker in humans.

 Author summary
Influenza A viruses are the causative agents of annual epidemics, sporadic zoonotic out-
breaks and occasionally pandemics. Worldwide, acute respiratory infections caused by
influenza A viruses continue to be one of the main causes of acute illness and death. The
appearance in 2009 of a new H1N1 pandemic influenza strain reinforced the search to
identify viral pathogenicity determinants for evaluation of the consequences of virus epi-
demics and potential pandemics for human health. Here we identify a new general viru-
lence determinant found in a cohort of severe/fatal influenza virus-infected patients, a
reduced accumulation of viral defective genomes. These molecules are incomplete viral
genome segments that activate the innate immune response. This data will contribute to
the prediction of influenza disease severity, to improved guidance of patient treatment
and will enable the development of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.
Introduction
Acute respiratory infections are a main cause of severe illness and death worldwide. Influenza
A virus (IAV) causes annual epidemics and occasional pandemics with potentially fatal out-
come [1]; the global burden of seasonal influenza is >600 million cases, with 5 million cases of
severe illness and up to 500,000 deaths each year. Annual influenza epidemics affect all age
groups, although infants, the elderly, and individuals with underlying medical conditions are
most severely affected. The existence of co-morbid conditions and the immune status may
contribute to the patient outcome. Comorbid conditions for influenza include diabetes,
chronic metabolic of lung, renal and cardiac diseases, immunosuppression, pregnancy and
obesity [2–4]. Although comorbidities are found in many severe or even fatal cases, a consider-
able number of apparently healthy individuals nonetheless suffer severe infection, which sug-
gests the coexistence of influenza strains with increased virulence among circulating viruses.
We previously tested this hypothesis by characterizing two IAV strains from the AH1N1
2009 pandemic (AH1N1pdm09), one isolated from a fatal case in a person with no known pre-
viously described comorbidities (F-IAV, fatal-case IAV) and the other from a patient with
mild symptoms (M-IAV, mild-case IAV) [5]. F-IAV virulence was greater than that of M-IAV
in cell culture, and showed higher pathogenicity in the in vivo murine model [5].
IAV virulence and pathogenesis are dependent on complex, multigenic mechanisms
involving the viral genetic characteristics, the host conditions, the virus-host interactions, and
the host response to the infection. Special effort has been previously made to identify virulence
determinants of AH1N1pdm09 viruses and AH1N1 seasonal viruses. As a result, some resi-
dues distributed all over the genome have been associated to increased virulence of specific
viral isolates [6, 7]. These determinants map mainly to the polymerase genes (PB1, PB2, PA),
the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and non-structural protein 1 (NS1) (reviewed
in [8]). Attenuating factors have also been described in cell culture [9, 10].
A proportion of influenza virus particles have defective genome RNAs (DVGs) due to inter-
nal deletions of viral segments [11–14]. The DVGs have the 3’ and 5’ ends of the parental RNA
segments, and most have a single, large central deletion that generates viral RNAs of 180–1000
nucleotides [15–17]. DVGs have been found for all viral segments, but most derive from PB2,
PB1 and PA RNAs [15, 17, 18]. The presence of DVGs potentiates the host response in cul-
tured cells [19, 20] and in animal models and leads to attenuated infection [21], possibly
through recognition of double-stranded RNA by receptors that activate antiviral signaling cas-
cades [19] (reviewed in [22]).

 Although our understanding of influenza pathogenesis is considerable, a potential general
virulence determinant in humans remains to be identified. Here we used next-generation
sequencing (NGS) to evaluate the role of defective genomes in the pathogenicity of influenza
virus circulating in the human population. We found that the low amount of DVGs accumu-
lated in tissue culture cells correlates with increased pathogenicity in mice both, in natural iso-
lates or recombinant viruses. To corroborate these findings we performed a genomic analysis
of viruses isolated from respiratory samples of a select cohort of IAV A(H1N1)pdm09-infected
patients who suffered severe or fatal outcome, or from a cohort of infected patients with mild
disease. The former viruses showed significantly less accumulation of DVGs than the latter.
We suggest that low DVGs abundance has a major role in the severe outcome of IAV-infected
patients.
Results
Virulence and pathogenicity of F- and M-IAV correlate with DVGs
abundance
We previously characterized two virus isolates, the F-IAV derived from a fatal case in a young
person with no known previously described comorbidities and the M-IAV, from a young
patient with mild symptoms.
History of viruses.
F- and M-IAV were isolated from upper respiratory tract samples of
the infected patients. The viruses were grown in cell culture and in normalized conditions to
eliminate possible differences due to the clinical status, time of sampling and genetic back-
ground of the infected patients. For that, viral stocks of F- and M-IAV were generated by infec-
tion of cell cultures at a low multiplicity of infection (0.0001 moi) to limit the production of
DVGs [23] and viruses obtained from this passage were used for the following assays.
DVGs accumulation of F- and M-IAV in cell culture. As described, F-IAV grows faster
in cell culture and is more pathogenic in mice than M-IAV [5]. Viral genome RNA obtained
from purified virions were deep-sequenced and consensus sequence comparison showed sev-
eral amino acid changes that might be responsible for their distinct pathogenicity [5]. Detailed
analysis of the RNA deep-sequences showed that in addition to the viral full-length RNAs,
defective genomic RNAs (DVGs) were observed in these samples (S1 Table). Large internal
deletions that generate small DVGs activate the innate immune response [20], and influenza
viral RNAs preferably �1000 nucleotides (nt) bind the viral sensor RIG-I [19] (reviewed in
[22, 24]); thus, only DVGs up to 1000 nt were analyzed in this study (Fig 1A). The proportion
between sequences reads corresponding to DVGs deletion sites (junction reads) and total
virus reads was calculated for each virus (DVGs proportion); we observed a 10-fold lower
DVGs proportion in the F-IAV than the M-IAV (Fig 1B and S6 Fig). DVGs found in F- and
M-IAV derived from the RNA segments encoding the viral polymerase subunits as previously
described [17] (Fig 1C and S1 Table). To estimate the ability of these viruses to generate
DVGs, we analyze the amount of DVGs versus complete viral RNA of the same genome seg-
ment by RT-PCR both, in the initial stocks and during the viral replication cycle, performing
serial blind passages of F- and M- IAV stocks at 3 pfu/cell. This condition of high multiplicity
of infection, would allow an exacerbated generation of DVGs [23]. The results (Fig 2 and S1
Fig), showed that the initial M-IAV stock contained more DVGs than the F-IAV isolate (Fig
2B) and this difference was observed also in three independent plaque-purified clones of F-
and M-IAV (Fig 2C). Both, F- and M-IAV accumulated more DVGs along serial passages.
However, M-IAV did so more rapidly than F-IAV (Fig 2D and S1A and S1B Fig). The distinct
ability to generate DVGs by these viruses was corroborated using two different viral stocks
(S1A and S1B Fig), and one plaque purified clone of F- or M-IAV (Fig 2D). Some DVGs

 amplified by RT-PCR (indicated with asterisks in Fig 2B and 2C) were cloned and sequenced
to corroborate that this short amplification products correspond to viral RNA segments with
large internal deletions (S2A and S3A Figs).
Antiviral response of F- and M-IAV infected cells. To monitor the activation of the cel-
lular antiviral response induced by these viruses, we evaluated the interferon (IFN) induction
cascade upon infection of A549 cells that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the
control of the IFN promoter (A549/pr(IFN-ß).GFP cells). GFP expression acts as a marker for
activation of the IFN induction pathway in these cells [25, 26].
These cells were infected with M- or F-IAV at moi 3, or mock infected. As a positive con-
trol, cells were infected with Del NS1 virus, an influenza virus that cannot counteract the

 antiviral response [27, 28]. GFP production was quantified by flow cytometry at 8, 15 or 24
hpi, and the results indicated that DelNS1 virus induces large amounts of GFP and F-IAV was
a worse IFN inducer than M-IAV (0.27-fold, p<0.001 at 15hpi and 0.33, p<0.001 at 24hpi)
(Fig 3A). To further evaluate the antiviral response mediated by these viruses, A549 cells were
infected with DelNS1, M- or F-IAV, or were mock infected, and accumulation of IFN-stimu-
lated genes (ISGs), Mx and ISG56 proteins, was monitored by western blot. F-IAV infected
cells accumulated lower levels of Mx and ISG56 proteins than M-IAV (0.29- and 0.48-fold,
respectively, p<0.01) (Fig 3B and S4A Fig). The same result was observed for F- and M-IAV
clones obtained from purified plaques (0.31- and 0.38-fold, respectively, p<0.001) (Fig 3C and
S4B Fig). The difference in the induction of innate antiviral response in infected-human lung
epithelial cells coincides with differences in accumulation of DVGs (Figs 1B, 2B–2D and S1B
and S1C Fig), which agrees with previous reports [19, 20, 22].

 DVGs accumulation of F- and M-IVA in lungs of infected mice.
Since F-IAV is more
virulent than M-IAV in the murine model [5], we tested whether these distinct capacities to
generate DVGs were apparent in vivo; the accumulation of DVGs and viral genome was ana-
lyzed in the lungs of M- and F-IAV-infected mice. In whole lung tissue (S5A Fig) and in viri-
ons purified from lung (S5B Fig), DVGs accumulation was greater in M- than in F-IAV-
infected mice. There is thus a clear correlation between DVGs accumulation mediated by F-
and M-IAV and their pathogenicity in the murine model [5].

 Specific mutations in the polymerase of a fatal-case virus determine
DVGs accumulation
Comparison of the F- and M-IAV consensus sequences showed nine amino acid changes in
the F isolate [5] taken the A/California/04/2009 strain as reference. Changes in the viral poly-
merase PA (D529N) and PB2 (A221T) subunits and the surface glycoprotein HA (S127L)
found in <1% of viruses circulating during 2009 influenza season were considered specific
and potentially responsible for the difference in virulence [5]. Since DVGs are mainly pro-
duced by the viral polymerase, PA D529N and PB2 A 221T changes in the polymerase subunits
were selected as putative responsible for low DVGs production and increased pathogenicity of
F-IAV.
To further characterize the role of mutations in the F-IAV polymerase subunits as virulence
determinants, we generated on the A/H1N1/California/04/09 virus backbone (CAL), recombi-
nant influenza viruses bearing the combination of PA D529N and PB2 A221T mutations
(PB2/PA mut; F-IAV-like polymerase), or viruses bearing single PA D529N (PA mut) or PB2
A221T (PB2 mut) mutations (Table 1). These viruses were grown in cell culture at a low moi
(0.0001) to limit the production of DVGs and viruses obtained from this passage were used for
the following assays.
The activity of the reconstituted polymerases of these three mutant viruses and the wild-
type virus was first evaluated in a mini-replicon assay, which showed not significant differ-
ences (Fig 4A and 4B). Next, growth kinetics in cell culture showed that all recombinant
viruses accumulates similar levels of viral proteins in a single cycle replication assay (Fig 4C)
and replicated at a similar rate in a multiple cycle assay (Fig 4D).
Deep sequencing analysis of recombinant viruses. Deep sequencing of RNA from puri-
fied virions of wild-type and mutant recombinant viruses showed that CAL virus accumulates
low DVGs levels, which coincides with the reported high virulence of the CAL reference strain
[1], and is similar to the F-IAV (S6 Fig). The PB2/PA mut and PA mut viruses showed DVGs
accumulation similar to CAL virus (2.6- and 1.3-fold change, respectively; Fig 5A), whereas
PB2 mut had a 27-fold higher DVG ratio than CAL virus, which was almost 11-fold higher
than PB2/PA mut (with the F-like polymerase) (Fig 5A).

 DVGs proportion of CAL virus is taken as 1 and DVGs proportion of the other recombi-
nant viruses are indicated as CAL fold-change. We determined DVGs distribution per viral
segment for all DVGs found in each recombinant virus (Fig 5B, left columns), and observed
that the DVGs derive from several segments. These data indicated that the PB2 A221T muta-
tion enabled high DVGs accumulation (Fig 5A; compare CAL vs PB2 mut), whereas PA
D529N mutation restricted their accumulation (Fig 5A; compare PB2 mut vs PB2/PA mut).
The combination of PA and PB2 changes, which mimics F-IAV polymerase, leads to low
DVGs accumulation, as also observed for the F-IAV itself.
To confirm that the PA D529N mutation in F-IAV has a major effect on the ability to pro-
duce low DVGs numbers, we generated recombinant CAL viruses bearing mutations in genes
other than polymerase subunits, such as matrix 1 (M1) and matrix 2 (M2) viral genes (M1

 S30N + M2 V86S). These mutations enable influenza virus to accumulate large numbers of
DVGs in an H3N2 viral strain [20]. We deep-sequenced RNA from virions purified from
recombinant viruses with these M1/M2 mutations, alone (M mut) or with these M1/M2 muta-
tions and PA D529N mutation (M-PA mut). DVGs number and distribution in these virions
are shown in Fig 5C and 5B, right columns. We found a 37-fold DVGs increase in M mut com-
pared to wild-type (wt) CAL virus (Fig 5C), in accordance with the ability of the M1/M2 muta-
tions to increase DVGs in an H3N2 influenza virus [20]. As predicted, introduction of the PA
D529N mutation on the M mut background decreased the DVGs proportion (4-fold; Fig 5C,
compare M-PA mut vs M mut).

 In addition, complete viral genome analysis corroborated that each recombinant virus bore
the specific mutation or combination of mutations, and no compensatory mutations were
detected. Therefore, the differences in the accumulation of DVGs are mediated exclusively by
the genetically introduced mutations.
Thereby, PA D529N present in a fatal-case virus is able to decrease the amount of DVGs in
two different genetic backgrounds (Fig 5D), reinforcing the notion that this mutation itself
confers this ability.
DVGs accumulation of recombinant viruses in cell culture. Similarly to F- and M-IAV,
we evaluated DVGs accumulation of viral stocks by analyzing the amount of DVGs versus
complete viral RNA of the same genome segment by RT-PCR as described previously (Fig 2A
and S2A Fig). This analysis showed that the PB2 mut virus stock had more DVGs than CAL wt
virus or virus carrying PA 529N mutation (PA mut) and, that PA mutation is able to reduce
this large accumulation (compare PB2 mut vs PB2/PA mut Fig 6A). Some of the RT-PCR
amplified DVGs products were cloned (indicated with asterisks in Fig 6A) and sequenced to
corroborate that they correspond to viral RNA segments with large internal deletions (S2B and
S3B Figs). In addition, cultures of human lung epithelial cells were infected at 3 plaque-form-
ing units (pfu)/cell and accumulation of DVGs over time was evaluated for each mutant virus
in these conditions in which the production of DVGs is exacerbated [23]. Total RNA extracts
were obtained at 4, 8 or 12 hours post-infection (hpi). The estimation of DVGs amount versus
complete viral RNA of the same genome segment was analyzed by RT-PCR as described previ-
ously (Fig 2A and S2A Fig). This analysis showed that all viruses generate and accumulate
DVGs in the infected cells and PB2 mut virus produces DVGs at higher rate than PA mut virus
(5.4-fold, p<0.05 at 4hpi and 9-fold, p<0.001 at 8hpi) and PB2/PA mut virus (13-fold, p<0.01
at 4hpi and 5.8-fold, p<0.001 at 8hpi) (Fig 6B and S7 Fig).
Antiviral response of recombinant viruses. Next, the induction of the antiviral response
by the different recombinant viruses was evaluated by monitoring the accumulation of antivi-
ral proteins Mx and ISG56 by western blot at 16 hpi. Treatment with IFN or infection with Del
NS1 virus was used as positive control of induction of the antiviral response in these cells. PB2
mut infected cells accumulate higher amount of Mx than the other CAL, PA mut or PB2/PA
mut recombinant viruses infected cells (4.4-fold, 2.0-fold and 3.5-fold, p<0.001, respectively)
(Fig 6C and S8A Fig). Similar results were obtained for accumulation of ISG56 in PB2 mut
infected cells compared to CAL, PA mut or PB2/PA mut infected cells (3.5-fold, 2-fold and
2.3-fold, p<0.001, respectively) (Fig 6C and S8B Fig). There was a clear correlation between
the induction of antiviral response (Fig 6C) and the accumulation of DVGs (Fig 6A) as previ-
ously described for F- and M-IAV (Figs 1B, 3B and 3C) and for other viruses [19, 20, 22].
Correlation between DVGs accumulation and in vivo pathogenicity
To evaluate the pathogenesis induced by the different recombinant viruses carrying mutations
present in F-IAV, we infected mice with various virus doses of CAL, PB2 mut, PA mut or PB2/
PA mut viruses or with DMEM as control. Survival (Fig 7A) and body weight (S9 Fig) were
monitored daily for two weeks and the lethal dose 50 (LD50) for each virus was determined.
CAL, PB2 mut, PA mut and PB2/PA mut viruses showed an LD50 of 1x105, >106, 3 x 103 and
3.5 x 104, respectively (Fig 7B). These data confirmed that CAL virus is pathogenic in mice [1]
and indicated that the PA D529N mutation greatly increased pathogenicity, suggesting a deci-
sive effect of this polymerase change on disease outcome. PB2 mut, which accumulates high
DVG levels, was greatly attenuated compared with the CAL virus. Reconstitution of the F-like
polymerase-containing virus (PB2/PA mut) notably reduced DVGs accumulation (Fig 5A)
and led to higher pathogenicity compared with PB2 mut virus (Fig 7A and 7B).

 We additionally evaluated the pathogenicity of M mut and M-PA mut viruses in the same
way indicated above and the results show that the introduction of the M1+M2 mutations on
the CAL wt or PA mut backgrounds led to clear virus attenuation in mice, as the LD50
increased from 1 x 105 or 3 x 103, respectively, to >5 x 105 in both cases (Fig 7B). M-PA mut
virus pathogenicity was greater than that of M mut virus, as indicated by body weight loss after
sublethal infection (Fig 7C).
To further evaluate the pathogenicity differences among viruses bearing mutations present
in F-IAV, mice were infected with a sub-lethal dose (103 pfu) of recombinant mutant viruses,
or were mock-infected. Samples were recovered at several days post-infection (dpi) and viral

 titers determined in lung (Fig 8A). PA mut-infected mice showed the highest titers at 1, 2, and
4 dpi and the most rapid virus replication kinetics, whereas PB2 mut-infected mice showed the
lowest titers at all times tested.
Immune response of recombinant viruses in infected mice.
Virus pathogenicity
depends on the nature of the virus, the host conditions and its rapid and adequate response to
the infection. We have previously described the higher lung tissue damage induced by F-IAV
compared to M-IAV infected mice [5]. Additionally, we have observed that F-IAV seems to
induce higher inflammation in the lungs of the infected animals than M-IAV; proliferation of
macrophages as a representative lesion of interstitial pneumonia together with vasculitis as
accumulation of neutrophils was shown (S10 Fig). To see if the recombinant viruses produced
different immune response, we monitored by flow cytometry analysis the presence of neutro-
phils and alveolar macrophages in PA mut, PB2 mut or PB2/PA mut- infected lungs at several
days post-infection of sub-lethal infection (Fig 8B and 8C). Recombinant viruses with PA

 D529N change (PA mut and PB2/PA mut) induced higher infiltration of neutrophils and sig-
nificant depletion of alveolar macrophages than attenuated PB2 mut virus at 2dpi in the lungs
of infected animals (Fig 8B and 8C). These two alterations in cellular immune response
observed for viruses carrying PA D529N change have been described as essential factors for
lethal influenza virus infections [29, 30] and agree with the role of PA D529N change in patho-
genicity in vivo.
Altogether, these data demonstrate that a mutated PA D529N derived from a fatal-case IAV
decreases DVGs generation and support the idea that reduced DG accumulation is a patho-
genic determinant for influenza virus in mice. These results corroborate the importance of low
DG abundance in fatal influenza outcome.
Low number of DVGs is associated with severe or fatal outcome in
humans
Next, we wanted to examine whether accumulation of DVGs play a role in the pathogenicity
of influenza viruses in humans. Deep-sequencing of RNA from viruses isolated from

 respiratory samples of a select cohort of A(H1N1)pdm09-like virus-infected patients was per-
formed. This cohort includes patients with highly severe outcome including severe pneumonia
and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring admission to the intensive care
unit (ICU) with mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation for more than 96 hours
(Fig 9A) from 2012–2013 influenza season in Spain. For more precise characterization of the
intrinsic pathogenicity of these viruses, only those isolated from patients with no known
comorbidities and aged under 65 and over 4 were included (Fig 9A). This cohort (n = 4) is a
faithful representation (80–100%) of the total confirmed severe H1N1 influenza cases follow-
ing these criteria in the 2012–2013 Spanish influenza season (n = 4–5) (S2 Table) [31]. Addi-
tionally, two viruses isolated from deceased patients who accomplished these criteria, but
otherwise showed underlying medical conditions were evaluated; total severe/fatal cohort
n = 6 (Fig 9A). These viruses were compared to those isolated from a cohort (n = 6) of mild
IAV patients detected through the regular influenza surveillance system.
History of viruses isolated from severe/fatal or mild patients.
All these viruses were
obtained from exudates of the upper respiratory tract. Similarly to the described above for F-
and M-IAV, we isolated the viruses from each clinical sample and the titer of each isolated
viruses was determined for this first passage. To obtain the required amounts to purify the cor-
responding virions, all viruses were grown in cell culture in normalized conditions at a con-
trolled low multiplicity of infection to limit the production of DVGs, as indicated in the
material and methods section. This procedure would eliminate RNA amount differences due
to the clinical status, time or site of sampling and genetic background of the infected patients
and viruses obtained from this passage were used for deep-sequencing (S1 Table).
DVGs accumulation of viruses from infected patients.
We have obtained the consensus
sequence of all mild and severe/fatal viruses and none of the previous DVGs modulating muta-
tions were detected in any of them. Additionally we analyzed in detail the consensus sequence
of the three-polymerase subunits for all the evaluated viruses and mutations found in any of
the severe/fatal viruses that were not present in mild viruses were selected. The prevalence of
these changes in H1N1 viruses circulating in humans was calculated using all sequences avail-
able in the NCBI Influenza Resource database up to March 2016. Those mutations present in
<1% of the circulating viruses were selected as additional putative severe/fatal exclusive muta-
tions (S3 Table).
In addition to the viral full-length RNAs, DVGs were observed in all samples. The propor-
tion between sequence reads corresponding to DVGs deletion sites (junction reads) and total
virus reads was calculated for each virus (DVGs proportion); we observed a 10-fold reduction
in the DVGs proportion in viruses isolated from severe/fatal cases (n = 6) compared to those
from mild patients (n = 6; p = 0.0152) (Fig 9B and S11 Fig). DVGs distribution per viral seg-
ment for total DVGs found in each virus is shown for the entire severe/fatal (Fig 10A and
S12A Fig) and mild-associated case virus collection (Fig 10B and S12B Fig). Since it has been
described that the majority of DVGs are generated in the segments of the viral polymerase [15,
17, 18], we have additionally statistically evaluated the amount of DVGs generated exclusively
in those segments (S13 Fig). It can be observed that the difference in these three segments is
indeed greater (23-fold; p = 0.0124) than in the whole viral genome. These both data support
the notion that viruses with low DVGs abundance have a role in the severe and fatal outcome
in IAV infected patients.
Discussion
Influenza virus pathogenicity has been studied in depth for many years, and several amino
acid changes have been identified as virulence determinants [1, 6–8, 32], however, a general

 pathogenicity determinant has not been characterized. Although DVGs have been described
in natural animal infections [33, 34] and in pandemic AH1N1pdm09- and other respiratory
virus-infected individuals [35, 36] their role in viral pathogenicity in patients has not been
evaluated. The correlation between DVGs accumulation and severe disease observed in the
severe/fatal- and mild-case viruses isolated from respiratory samples suggests that DVGs gen-
eration is a critical feature of severe influenza virus infection. We tested this hypothesis geneti-
cally by analyzing recombinant viruses bearing mutations identified in a fatal-outcome virus
(F-IAV, mutations PB2 A221T and PA D529N) [5] or described elsewhere (mutations M1
S30N + M2 V86S) [20]. Whereas the non-pathogenic mutation PB2 A221T accumulates high
levels of DVGs in cultured cells and is attenuated in mice (PB2 mut versus CAL), mutation PA
D529N reduces DVGs accumulation alone or in combination with PB2 A221T change (Fig
5A) or with M1 S30N + M2 V86 S mutations (M-PA mut versus M mut) (Fig 5C). Moreover,
recombinant viruses carrying PA D529N mutation displayed increased viral pathogenicity in
the infected mice (PB2/PA mut and PA mut) (Fig 7).
Selection criteria used for determination of putative virulent markers found in 2009 in
F-IAV has been updated, and the prevalence of these changes in H1N1 viruses circulating in
humans was calculated using all sequences available in the NCBI Influenza Resource database

 from December 2009 to March 2016. This analysis showed that PA D529N change continues
to be a rare mutation specific of F-IAV, but PB2 221 position admitted several changes includ-
ing T. This data indicates that at position 221 of PB2 changes have been established in addition
to the original A in the further circulating viruses after the influenza 2009 pandemic and this
position might not be relevant for the increased pathogenicity of the F-IAV (Table 1). This
data correlates with our findings, which indicate that PB2 A221T change is not responsible for
the increased pathogenicity of the F-IAV.
Here we adopted a highly restrictive approach to evaluate the potential role of DVGs accu-
mulation as a determinant of severe influenza disease in humans, although a contribution of
the immune status of the patient to the infection outcome cannot be excluded. We analyzed
influenza viruses from a select cohort of patients, under 65 years and over 4 years of age, who
suffered severe or fatal influenza infection. These viruses were compared with those obtained
from a cohort of mild infected patients detected through the regular surveillance system. Deep
sequencing identified an inverse correlation between DVGs accumulation and virus pathoge-
nicity in these cohorts (Fig 9). Those patients with no known comorbidities infected with low
DVGs producer viruses developed a severe outcome, and those who showed comorbid condi-
tions eventually died, indicating that both factors may contribute to the fatal outcome of the
infection. The later data is in agreement with our previous study where we found that, besides
being infected with the virulent F-IAV, which accumulates a reduced amount of DVGs, the
infected patient presented a new confirmed genetic risk factor, a truncated form of Ccr5 gene
[37, 38]. Thus, both the high virulence of the infecting virus, and the genetic risk factor, may
have contributed to the fatal outcome of the patient.
None of the severe/fatal cohort viruses bore PA D529N change. This result suggest that low
DVGs accumulation in severe/fatal-case viruses might be mediated by various changes other
than D529N in PA polymerase subunit, or in distinct polymerase subunits (S3 Table), or in
several viral proteins; this coincides with the complex, multigenic nature of the pathogenesis
mechanisms [8]. Actually, changes in the polymerase [9] and in NS2 protein [10] modulate

 DVGs production in cell culture. Mutations in M1 and M2 [20] also modulate DVGs accumu-
lation, probably by altering DVGs encapsidation in progeny virions [39, 40]. Therefore,
reduced accumulation of DVGs constitutes a virulent factor itself, regardless the mutations
responsible.
Regarding the possible mechanism of PA in low DVGs production, colleagues E. Fodor and
G. Brownlee described some years ago that mutation A638R in the PA subunit was involved in
the enormous accumulation of DGs in cell culture [9]. It was there described that this high
DGs generation was due to an elongation defect by destabilization of RNA-PA subunit interac-
tion, and that this phenomenon could be reverted by another mutation in the same PA poly-
merase subunit (C453R). The authors proposed a putative domain involved in elongation
activity in the PA-C part of this polymerase subunit. We have localized PAD529N mutation in
the viral polymerase structure (S14 Fig) [54], and they are spatially in the same PA-C domain
nearby these previously described mutations. This data suggests that PA D529N may be
involved in the same elongation process, although this activity would need to be further
explored. In addition, Influenza A virus polymerase exists in different oligomerization state
[55, 56], which allows different assembly of polymerase monomers during replication [57]. A
new proposed mechanism suggests that the RNA depending RNA polymerase (vRdRP) dimer
bound to viral RNA recruits another free polymerase dimer to form transient tetramer, which
initiates replication of viral genome [58]. PA D529N mutation localizes on the interaction sur-
face of this proposed dimerization model of the viral polymerase (S15 Fig). All these data sug-
gest that this mutation (or other mutations on this same area) may alter the possible
polymerase dimerization or, it may modify the stability of the RNA- polymerase complex, or
additionally it may change the interaction with any cellular required factor, or any combina-
tion of them.
The role of DVGs in inducing the innate immune response has been demonstrated in cell
culture [19] and animal models [21]. Studies in several animal models have led to proposals
for the use of DG molecules or viruses modified to generate them in large numbers as protec-
tive elements against influenza virus infection [41]. It would be likely that the reduced activa-
tion of the antiviral state of cells infected with low DVGs producer viruses might induce an
impaired immune response in infected animals or patients. The initially reduced antiviral state
of the infected cells (Figs 3 and 6C) may allow the virus to grow uncontrolled for a short time
and then this would induce an exacerbated immune response and inflammation which was
described for severe IAV infected patients in the 2009 pandemic [42, 43]. In viral infections,
neutrophils and alveolar macrophages play a key role in clearance and control of viral growth
in infected lungs, thus their substantial migration to the site of inflammation in infected tissue
contributes to overall viral pathogenicity. Depletion of alveolar macrophages leads to an
uncontrolled viral proliferation and fatal outcome in infected mice [30, 44] while high influx
of neutrophils in lungs and excessive inflammation has been associated with severe illness and
high mortality rate in influenza infection [29]. The depletion of alveolar macrophages perfectly
correlates with increased viral titers in lung tissue of PA mut and PB2/PA mut infected animals
(Fig 8A and 8C), emphasizing again the crucial role of these cells in viral clearance and control
of viral growth. In addition, an increased influx of neutrophils, which is associated with lethal
influenza virus infection [29], has been observed in recombinant viruses carrying a mutation
(PA mut and PB2/PA mut) (Fig 8B) present in a fatal-case virus, which produce reduced
amount of DVGs (Fig 5A).
Although DVGs are produced in the polymerase segments (PB1, PB2 and PA), as previ-
ously described [13, 18], most viruses studied here also generate DVGs in other segments (Figs
5B and 10). The distribution of DVGs of the different cohorts is interestingly observed in some
distinct viral segments, which is specially reduced (23-fold) for the polymerase subunits

 segments in the severe/fatal—associated case viruses compared to viruses isolated from mild
cases (Fig 10 and S13 Fig). These findings suggest that the genomic combination of DVGs pro-
duced by each virus, and not only absolute numbers, may also contribute to pathogenicity.
In summary, we establish a significant association between low DVGs accumulation and an
increase in severe or fatal outcome in human influenza virus infection (Fig 9); we provide
genetic support for this association in infected cultured cells and in mice. In addition to the
previous reports about the role of DVGs in natural animal infections here we present data
indicating that a reduced accumulation of DVGs may be considered a new virulence marker
for viral pathogenicity in humans. Evaluation of DVGs phenotype of circulating viruses might
predict its potential to induce severe disease. Additional work is needed to define specific
DVGs function and the mechanism by which they are produced in humans. These data could
contribute substantially to the prediction of influenza disease severity and enable the develop-
ment of risk-based prevention strategies and policies.

Ethics statement
All procedures that required the use of animals complied with Spanish and European legisla-
tion concerning vivisection and the use of genetically modified organisms, and the protocols
were approved by the National Center for Biotechnology Ethics Committees on Animal Exper-
imentation and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientı
´ficas (CSIC) Bioethics Subcom-
mittee (permit 11014). We followed the guidelines included in the current Spanish legislation
on protection for animals used in research and other scientific aims (RD 53/2013) and the cur-
rent European Union Directive 2014/11/EU on protection for animals used in experimenta-
tion and other scientific aims.
The National Influenza Center in Madrid (Instituto de Salud Carlos III) and other regional
laboratories from different Spanish regions, constituted the ReLEG network included in the
Spanish Influenza Surveillance System (SISS), which monitored the circulation of influenza
viruses each influenza season as a part of the countrywide surveillance. The viruses described
in this study have been detected within this surveillance activity. An informed consent is not
needed for this study since the patients from whom these viruses were isolated were
anonymized.
Biosafety
Cell culture and mouse model experiments performed with recombinant viruses bearing
mutations detected in a fatal case of IAV were performed in BSL2+ conditions and in a biolog-
ical insulator in BSL2+ animal facilities, respectively.
Biological materials
Cell lines used in this study were canine kidney MDCK (ATCC), human lung epithelium
A549 (ATCC) [45] and human embryonic kidney HEK293T (ATCC) cells [46].
Clinical viral isolates
Viruses used in the present study were selected according to the following criteria for the
patients from whom the viruses were isolated. Patients included in the severe/fatal cohort were
influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 confirmed cases, aged over 4 and under 65, admitted to intensive
care unit (ICU) and with the information related to risk factors reflected in their clinical his-
tory. Those patients who developed highly severe disease did not display any comorbidities

 associated to severe influenza A virus infection, and deceased patients presented some comor-
bid conditions. Mild patients were influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 confirmed cases, aged over 4
and under 65, who developed mild disease and were monitored by sentinel medical centers
included in the Spanish National Influenza Surveillance System. Selection of cases for this mild
cohort was randomly made within the patients who meet the described above criteria and
whose isolated virus were from the same Saint-Petersburg phylogenetic lineage as those from
the severe/fatal cohort, accordingly to their HA gene. Respiratory samples were collected in
virus transport medium (MEM, 200 U/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 U/ml
mycostatin and 0.25% bovine serum albumin fraction V) and delivered to the Spanish
National Influenza Center.
All influenza A viruses were isolated at the National Influenza Centre (CNM, ISCIII) from
respiratory samples sent for virological characterization by the Spanish Influenza Surveillance
System (SISS). The National Influenza Center in Madrid and other regional laboratories con-
stitute the ReLEG network of the SISS, which monitors virus circulation each influenza season
as a part of the countrywide surveillance. All viruses from either mild or severe/fatal patients
were isolated from the upper respiratory tract, pharyngeal or nasopharyngeal exudates. Semi-
confluent monolayers of MDCK cells were used for primary viral isolation. The monolayers
were inoculated with 200 μl of homogenized samples; when the cytopathic effect was 75–
100%, cultures were harvested and the supernatants used for virus stock generation by inocula-
tion of MDCK cells.
Mutagenesis of pCAGGs-PB2 and PA plasmids derived from CAL/04/09
Specific mutations were engineered in expression pCAGGS plasmids derived from the CAL
strain using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) as recommended
by the manufacturer. These materials were developed using the Licensed technology
(Kawaoka-P99264US Recombinant Influenza viruses for vaccines and gene therapy).
Minireplicon assay
The recombinant minireplicon assay was performed essentially as described [47]. In brief, cul-
tures of HEK293T cells (2.5 × 106 cells) were transfected with a mixture of plasmids expressing
the RNP components (pCMVPA, 2.5 ng; pCMVPB1, 12.5 ng; pCMVPB2, 12.5 ng; and
pCMVNP, 500 ng) and a genomic plasmid expressing a viral RNA (vRNA)-like chlorampheni-
col acetyltransferase reporter gene (pHHCAT, 500 ng) using the calcium phosphate technique
[48]. At 20 h posttransfection, total cell extracts were prepared and CAT accumulation deter-
mined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA; GE Healthcare), using purified CAT
enzyme as a standard.
Generation of recombinant influenza viruses
Specific mutations were engineered in recombinant virus genomic pHH plasmids derived
from the A/H1N1/California/04/2009 strain using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis
kit (Stratagene) as recommended by the manufacturer. These materials were developed using
the Licensed technology (Ref. Kawaoka-P99264US Recombinant Influenza viruses for vaccines
and gene therapy). The mutations were rescued into infectious virus by standard techniques
[49, 50]. Briefly, to rescue infectious virus from cDNAs, 105 293T HEK cells were cotrans-
fected with a mixture of 12 plasmid DNAs (100 ng each) including (i) 8 genomic plasmids
each carrying a viral segment cDNA under the control of the polI promoter and (ii) 4 expres-
sion plasmids encoding the three polymerase subunits and the NP. Transfection was carried
out at with Lipofectamine Plus (Gibco) under the conditions recommended by the

 manufacturer. At 16 h post-transfection, transfected cells were plated onto an excess of MDCK
cells. When a cytopathic effect was apparent, the supernatant medium was collected and used
for plaque assay on MDCK cells to estimate viral titer. The supernatant was used to produce a
viral stock at low multiplicity of infection. The identity of rescued mutant viruses was ascer-
tained by sequencing of DNAs derived from the PA and PB2 RNA segments by reverse tran-
scription-PCR (RT-PCR) amplification.
Generation of viral stocks
Supernatants of harvested cells inoculated with clinical samples or transfected with plasmids
for the generation of recombinant viruses were titred by standard plaque assay. These first pas-
sages of every virus were used to inoculate fresh MDCK cells at indicated controlled low multi-
plicity of infection (0.0001 moi). All viral stocks used for further studies had a viral titer about
107 pfu/ml.
Virion purification and RNA isolation
For virus purification, culture supernatants of 10−4 moi-infected MDCK cells were centrifuged
(10 min, 3110 g, 4˚C). Supernatants were sedimented through a sucrose step gradient (TNE
buffer; 50% and 33% sucrose in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, pH 7.5) (1 h,
274000 g, 4˚C). The 50 to 33% interphase was collected, diluted in TNE buffer, and pelleted
through a cushion of 33% sucrose in TNE (2 h, 112000 g, 4˚C). For purification of viruses iso-
lated from infected mouse lung, the previous protocol was used with modification of the
sucrose gradient volume and rotors according to sample volume. For isolation, RNA in puri-
fied virions was treated with 0.5% SDS and 200μg/ml proteinase K in TNE (2 h, 37˚C), fol-
lowed by extraction with phenol-chloroform-isoamylalcohol-hydroxyquinolein and ethanol
precipitation [51]. DNA was removed by DNAse treatment (Roche) according to manufactur-
er’s instructions. Quality and quantity of each RNA preparation was monitored using the Agi-
lent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) (S2 Table). Appropriate amounts of each sample
were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing (see below).
Western blotting
For the detection of viral and cellular proteins, total cell extracts were collected and Western
blot assays were performed as described [49]. Antibodies to GAPDH, β-actin (both from
Sigma), ISG56, Mx1 (both from Santa Cruz), NP and PB1 [57] were used.
Deep sequencing
Sequencing for previously described F- and M-IAV isolated during the 2009–2010 [5] influ-
enza season was performed with the Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx using Illumina v5
sequencing chemistry and 36 bp single reads. Base calling was performed using Illumina pipe-
line version 1.7.0 (within SCS 2.8). All other viruses were sequenced with TruSeq v3 chemistry
and 50 bp single reads on an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Total reads in each sample are indicated in
S1 Table.
Deep sequencing data analysis
Short read alignment against the influenza genome.
For each sample, FASTQ sequences
were aligned against the influenza (A/California/04/09) genome with TopHat2 [52], allowing
intron size ranges between 5 and 100000 nucleotides. Samtools [53] was used to extract reads
that aligned as two separate fragments (jumping reads) from the BAM files generated by

 TopHat2. Only reads that were split into two fragments that align at distant segment positions
(jumping reads) were selected. Alignments were made using all default parameters with just
one exception: we have been more restrictive than the default program and have taken into
account just jumping reads supported by at least four nucleotides on one side of the junction.
Additionally, only primary alignments were taken into account and secondary alignments pro-
posed by the program were discarded. Reads which align with total viral genome and with
each viral segment, and jumping reads in each sample are shown in S1 Table.
Viral sequence consensus determination.
To determine the consensus sequence of each
virus, coverage and nucleotide composition of aligned reads were analyzed. Nucleotide posi-
tions with an identity of �75% were considered. Samtools mpileup [53] and in-house php
scripts were used.
Junction quantification, filtering and normalization.
Only defective segments generated
by two or more jumping reads spanning exactly the same coordinates and that generate a theo-
retical final RNA segment size of �1000 nucleotides were selected. For samples from the year
2009, read orientation could not be determined as the sequencing protocol applied was not
strand-specific. In the remaining samples, only reads from genomic RNA strand were counted.
For each sample, values for jumping reads per million (RPM) were calculated as the sum of all
selected jumping reads divided by the number of total reads that aligned with the influenza
genome, then multiplied by 106. For analysis of jumping reads per segment, RPM values were
normalized to total reads aligned with each RNA segment of the genome.
Nucleotide sequence accession number.
The RNA-Seq data obtained in this study have
been deposited in the NCBI-SRA database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under accession
no. SRP077920.
DVGs detection
RT-PCR for the PA or PB2 segments was used to determine the presence of DVGs and their
relative amount to the full-length RNA of the same viral segment. To detect full-length seg-
ments, internal primers were used to amplify a central fragment, which is not present in
DVGs. To detect DVGs, the same RNA sample and external primers of the PA segment were
used in a separate reaction. Short amplification times were applied for the detection of both,
internal fragment corresponding to full-length segment and DVGs, to allow detection of
RNAs up to 1000nt in length. The method is illustrated in Fig 2A. The reverse transcription
reaction was performed for 30 min (42˚C), followed by PCR (35 rounds at 94˚C for 30 s, 53˚/
58˚C for 40 s, and 68˚C for 40 sec using the Titan-One RT-PCR kit (Roche)). As a specificity
control, the primers and RT-PCR conditions for DVGs amplification were used with a plasmid
encoding the full-length PA segment, and no amplification product was obtained (S1A Fig).
Additionally, primers and amplification conditions for internal fragment corresponding to
full-length segment were used with purified DVGs, and no amplification product was obtained
(S1A Fig).
Cloning and sequencing of DVGs
DVGs from cell cultured purified virions and from infected mice lung tissues were amplified
by RT-PCR (Titan-One RT-PCR kit, Roche) as indicated above. Obtained products were
amplified with Taq Polymerase (Sigma) for further cloning into pGEM-T vector using
pGEM-T Easy kit (Promega). Selected clones were sequenced by Sanger method and obtained
sequences were analyzed to confirm that they corresponded to defective genomes, including
the 30and 50ends and a large internal deletion of the full-length viral segment.

 Virus infections in cell culture
Cultured human lung alveolar epithelial cells (A549) were infected at 10−3 pfu/cell (low multi-
plicity of infection; moi) or 3 pfu/cell (high moi). After 1 h, non-bound virus was rinsed off
with acidic PBS (pH 5.3) and at various times (hours post-infection; hpi), cell supernatants
were collected and used for virus titration by plaque assay.
In vivo virus infections
To evaluate pathogenicity of the viruses, 5 female BALB/c AnNHsd mice (6–7 weeks old) were
infected intranasally with different doses (106−102) of each of the recombinant influenza
viruses described here, or were mock-infected. The animals were monitored daily for clinical
signs and body weights for two weeks. For ethical reasons, mice were euthanized when they
presented 25% body weight loss.
For the kinetics experiment, 5 female BALB/c mice (6–7 weeks old) were infected intrana-
sally with a sublethal dose (103 pfu/50μl DMEM) of recombinant PA mut, PB2 mut or PB2/PA
mut influenza viruses, or were mock-infected (50μl DMEM). Mice were euthanized at 1, 2, 4
and 7 dpi by CO2 inhalation and necropsied.
Viral titer estimation in extracted organs
Lung samples were homogenized in PBS-0.3%-BSA-penicillin/ streptomycin (100 IU/ml)
using an Electronic Douncer (IKA T10 basic, Workcenter). Lung samples were homogenized
1min at max speed at 4˚C and debris was pelleted by centrifugation (2000 g, 5 min, 4˚C). Viral
titer was determined by standard plaque assay on MDCK cells.
Preparation of lung cell suspension
Lungs samples were kept in RMPI medium at 4˚C. Tissue samples were grinded into very
small pieces prior to digestion with 180 μg/ml liberase (Roche) and 40 μg/ml DNase I (Roche)
in RMPI medium for 30 minutes at 37˚C. Digested fragments were filtrated with 40mm Nylon
Cell Strainer (BD Falcon) and resuspended with RMPI- 3%FBS. After centrifugation of samples
(1640 rmp, 5 min, 4˚C) additional step for erythrocyte lysis were performed. Cell pellet was
incubated for 1.5–2 min with 1ml of erythrocyte lysis buffer at RT. Lysis is inhibited by adding
9ml of PBS-5mM EDTA-3%FBS. Samples were then filtrated again with 40mm Nylon Cell
Strainer and pelleted by centrifugation (1640rpm, 5 min, 4˚C).
Flow cytometry analysis
Cell suspensions were distributed in 96 wells plate and first incubated with violet LIVE/ DEAD
due (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 4˚C, washed 2 twice with PBS and then incubated for 15 min at
4˚C with Fc block CD16 rat antibody. Samples were analysed by staining cell suspension with
one or more fluorochrome-labelled antibodies mix in PBS for 30 minutes at 4˚C in the dark.
Antibodies used were PerCP-Cy5.5-conjugated CD45 (clon 30-F11) (BioLegend), PeCy7-con-
jugated CD11b (clon M1/70) (BioLegend), APC-conjugated CD11c (clon N418)
(eBIOSCIENCE) and PE-conjugated Ly6G (clon 1A8) (BDBIOSCIENCE). Samples were than
fixed by incubation with 4% formaldehyde for 20 min, pelleted by centrifugation (700 rmp, 5
min, 4˚C) and washed once with PBS. After centrifugation (700 rmp, 5 min, 4˚C), cells were
resuspended in 0.4ml PBS and kept at 4˚C O/N in the dark. Flow cytometric analysis was per-
formed on a cytometer LSR II (BD Biosciences). Data were analyzed using CellQuestPro
software.

 Histopathology
Animal lungs were fixed in 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, sliced into 5 mm thick sec-
tions, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) by conventional methods.
Localization of mutations in 3D structures
UCSF Chimera 1.10.2 program was used for structural localization of specific mutations in the
influenza virus polymerase. Structure of the single influenza A polymerase under accession
4WSB, or structure of the dimerized form of influenza A polymerase complex in Protein Data
Bank (PDB) under accession 3J9B have been used as templates.
Statistics
Student’s t test and two-way ANOVA were used as indicated in each experiments and Figures.
A non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was applied to estimate the statistical significance of
differences between RPM. GraphPad Prism v. 5.00 (www.graphpad.com) was used for analysis.
