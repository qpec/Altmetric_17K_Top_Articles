 Association Between Opioid Prescribing Patterns
and Abuse in Ophthalmology

T
he present opioid use epidemic has garnered signifi-
cantattention.Overthelast16years,morethan183 000
Americans have died from overdose related to prescrip-
tion opioid use.1,2
The epidemic has set off ripples among policy makers. The
US Food and Drug Administration has launched the Opioid
Policy Steering Committee to explore and develop strategies
to confront the crisis. The committee looks to answer, among
other things, whether physicians are informed adequately re-
garding prescribing recommendations and whether clini-
cians are prescribing the appropriate number of doses for a
given medical indication.
Most people who eventually become addicted to opioids
are first exposed through prescription medications.3 Efforts
to combat the current situation are now being focused on the
pharmaceutical industry supplying the medications and phy-
sicians who are doing the prescribing. We set forth to under-
stand better the opioid prescribing habits of ophthalmolo-
gists and seek to better elucidate our role in the prescription
opioid abuse epidemic.

IMPORTANCE Drug overdoses have become the number 1 cause of mortality in American
adults 50 years and younger. Prescription opioid abuse is a growing concern that has
garnered widespread attention among policymakers and the general public.
OBJECTIVE To determine the opioid prescribing patterns among ophthalmologists and
elucidate their role in the prescription opioid abuse epidemic.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this observational cohort study, beneficiaries and
their physicians were analyzed using 2013 to 2015 Medicare Part D Prescriber Data. The
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use Files for
2013, 2014, and 2015 were accessed. Analysis began in June 2017. Data were collected and
analyzed regarding the prescribing patterns for opioid drugs (eg, number of prescriptions
written including refills, number of days’supply, and prescriber rates) for all participating
ophthalmologists.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The mean number of opioid prescriptions written annually
by ophthalmologists; prescriber rates compared with all prescriptions written; and
geographic distribution of opioid prescriptions written per ophthalmologist.
RESULTS In 2013, 4167 of 19 615 ophthalmologists were women (21.2%). Consistently, most
ophthalmologists (88%-89%) wrote 10 opioid prescriptions or fewer annually.
Approximately 1% (0.94%-1.03%) of ophthalmologists wrote more than 100 prescriptions
per year. On average, ophthalmologists wrote 7 opioid prescriptions per year (134 290
written annually by 19 638 physicians, on average) with a mean supply of 5 days. The 6 states
with the highest volume of opioid prescriptions written annually per ophthalmologist were
located in the southern United States.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In general, ophthalmologists show discretion in their opioid
prescribing patterns. The present opioid abuse epidemic should prompt physicians to
consider revisiting their prescribing protocols given the high risk for dependency.

 and other health care professionals paid for under the Medi-
care Part D Prescription Drug Program.
The prescriber type was limited to individual ophthal-
mologists with valid National Provider Identifier numbers
practicing in the United States. The data set matched physi-
cians’National Provider Identifier numbers and the specific
prescriptions dispensed at their direction. Data were col-
lected and analyzed regarding the individual prescribing
patterns for opioid drugs (number of prescriptions written in-
cluding refills, number of days’supply, and prescriber rate).
The number of prescriptions for each physician is reported if
no prescriptions are written or more than 10 are written for the
calendar year. All physicians prescribing 1 to 10 opioid pre-
scriptions during a calendar year are grouped together with-
out providing individual-level prescribing data. This is a mea-
sure from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to
protect privacy. To include in the analysis those physicians for
which individual-level data were not available (eg, those pre-
scribing between 1 to 10 opioid prescriptions), we estimated 5
prescriptions written annually.
The study was deemed exempt by the institutional re-
view board at Vanderbilt University Medical Center because
this was a quality improvement study. Informed consent was
not necessary because all data were publicly available and de-
identified. The Public Use File was downloaded and orga-
nized into Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp). Data analysis and
figure construction was performed using GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software). Mean, median, and range calculations
were performed for all quantitative variables.
Results
Number of Ophthalmologists
The Medicare Part D prescriber Public Use Files for 2013, 2014,
and 2015 included 19 615, 19 587, and 19 712 ophthalmolo-
gists, respectively. Age and race/ethnicity data were unavail-
able. In 2013, 4167 of 19 615 ophthalmologists were women
(21.2%).
Number of Opioid Prescriptions
The mean number of opioid prescriptions including refills
written by ophthalmologists did not change over the 3-year
study period (Table 1). In 2013, 95 898 prescriptions were
written by ophthalmologists writing more than 10 opioid
prescriptions, compared with 90 534 opioid prescriptions in
2015. The number of ophthalmologists prescribing more
than 10 opioid prescriptions was tabulated from the data
files. We then used these numbers to calculate the number
of prescriptions written per ophthalmologist. For this sub-
set, 41 to 44 opioid prescriptions were written per ophthal-
mologist per year during the 3-year study period. The mean
number of days’supply that opioid prescriptions were writ-
ten for was 5. In this subgroup of ophthalmologists, opioid
prescriptions represented 8% (mean) of their total prescrip-
tions written annually. The median prescriber rate was 4%,
implying the mean was skewed higher by certain prolific
opioid prescribers.
No individual prescribing data were given for ophthal-
mologists writing 1 to 10 opioid prescriptions in a given year.
Ifweassumethattheseprescriberswrote5prescriptionsayear
onaverage,thenumberofopioidprescriptionswrittenperoph-
thalmologist decreases to 7 per year.
Ophthalmologists’ Prescribing Patterns
Ophthalmologists were separated into 4 categories based on
the number of opioid prescriptions written per year: none, 1
to 10, 11 to 100, and more than 100 (Table 2). This was then
compared with the total number of prescribing ophthal-
mologists for the year. During the 3 years, 52 312 of 58 914
ophthalmologists (88.8%) wrote 10 prescriptions or fewer
Key Points
Question What are the trends in opioid prescribing among
ophthalmologists?
Findings In this observational cohort study, we analyzed Medicare
Part D Prescription Drug Program beneficiaries from 2013 to 2015
and found that 88% to 89% of ophthalmologists wrote 10 opioid
prescriptions or fewer annually. Southern states in the United
States tended to have a higher number of prescriptions written
per physician.
Meaning These results suggest ophthalmologists in general
prescribe opioids responsibly; the current prescription opioid
epidemic should prompt physicians to consider revisiting their
opioid prescribing protocols.

 per year. In total, 6023 (10.2%) wrote 11 to 100 opioid pre-
scriptions annually. Each year, approximately 1.0% of oph-
thalmologists wrote more than 100 opioid prescriptions
(Table 2). These numbers stayed consistent between 2013
(191 of 19 615 [0.97%]), 2014 (203 of 19 587 [1.03%]), and
2015 (185 of 19 712 [0.94%]).
Geographic Disparity in Prescribing Patterns
The data available were stratified based on geographic loca-
tion of the ophthalmologist. The number of opioid prescrip-
tions written overall in the state was averaged against the
number of physicians from that state in the database. The
analysis was limited to ophthalmologists writing more than
10 opioid prescriptions a year. See the Figure for the geo-
graphic distribution across the United States. Oklahoma,
Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and Texas consis-
tently had the highest number of prescriptions written per
physician annually. North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Ver-
mont, Alaska, and Wyoming had the lowest number of opi-
oid prescriptions written per physician between 2013 and
2015 (Table 3).
Discussion
Drug overdoses have become the number 1 cause of mortality
in American adults 50 years and younger. Policy makers are
now trying to address the root cause of the opioid abuse epi-
demic. Although a full discussion of the causes of this crisis is
beyond the scope of this article, the heavy emphasis on pain
control, along with the misuse of prescription opioids, are
implicated.5
Primary care physicians, based on sheer volume, pre-
scribe the most opioids.6,7 However, certain specialties,
such as dentistry and pain management, specifically have
high opioid prescribing rates compared with overall pre-
scriptions written. Opioid prescriptions comprised approxi-
mately 8% of prescriptions written by ophthalmologists, on
average. However, accounting for outliers, the median num-
ber of opioid prescriptions compared with total prescrip-
tions was 4%. This number is below the national mean of
6.8% among all prescribers.8 Additionally, this number is
considerably lower compared with other surgical services,
in which up to 37% of prescriptions written are for opioids.
Althoughcertainsurgicalspecialties,suchasdentistry,may
have high prescribing rates, the days supplied is important in
mitigatingabuse.Amongallhealthcareprofessionalsforwhich
datawereavailable,ophthalmologiststypicallyprescribe5-day
supplies of opioids. It is reasonable to assume that these are
prescribed for the immediate postoperative period after eye
surgery. Although postoperative pain control is an important
consideration, there is a known link between surgery and
chronic opioid use.9 One such study showed that patients re-
ceiving an opioid prescription within 7 days of ambulatory sur-

 gery (cataract surgery was 1 of the included procedures) were
44% more likely to become long-term opioid users.10 Al-
though health care professionals are trained to identify
patients with signs of opioid dependency, even opioid-naive
patients can be at risk for dependence after surgery.11
Pain after cataract surgery is typically minimal, espe-
cially with the widespread implementation of small incision
phacoemulsification.12,13 The advent of sutureless small-
gauge vitrectomy has also led to a significant reduction in post-
operative pain.14-16 Nonopioid pain relievers, such as acet-
aminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
frequently control postoperative discomfort.17,18 Although cer-
tain ophthalmic procedures may require stronger medica-
tions in the immediate postoperative period, this is certainly
not the norm. Health care professionals are tasked with indi-
vidualizing pain control regimens through the judicious use
of opioid medications.
Our analysis demonstrates variability in prescribing pat-
terns among ophthalmologists based on region in the United
States. Southern states tended to have an increased number
of opioid prescriptions written per physician. This is consis-
tent with overall physician opioid prescribing patterns, which
are disproportionately higher in southern states.19 Con-
versely, midwestern states had an overall lower number of opi-
oid prescriptions written per physician. This analysis specifi-
cally included physicians writing more than 10 opioid
prescriptions annually, as individual data were not available
forthoseprescribinglessfrequently.Thesenumbersaregreatly
influenced by certain outliers whose opioid prescriptions com-
prise 20% or more of all prescriptions written. However, our
analysis shows that if all physicians are included, opioid pre-
scribing makes up a minimal amount of overall prescriptions
in ophthalmology, with a mean of 7 prescriptions written an-
nually by each physician.
Limitations
The limits of our study relate to the database and information
available. The Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use File is de-
rived from beneficiaries participating in the Medicare Part D
prescription drug program. Physicians not participating in
Medicare Part D are not included. Although this database en-
compasses approximately 70% of all Medicare beneficiaries,
somepatientsweremissed.Additionally,thisanalysisdoesnot
take into account patients with private insurance or individu-
als without insurance. Any aggregated data from prescribers
with 10 or fewer claims are excluded from the database (a mea-
sure from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to
protectpatientprivacy).Weacknowledgethatthestatisticsmay
be skewed by certain high-volume prescribers. This is espe-
cially true given the number of physicians who did not record
any opioid prescriptions. Additionally, we cannot account for
physicians who may be retired or no longer practicing but still
listed in the Medicare Part D database.
However, despite these limitations, ophthalmologists ap-
pear to be cautious prescribers of opioids compared with their
surgical peers. Consistently between 2013 to 2015, almost 90%
of ophthalmologists wrote 10 or fewer opioid prescriptions an-
nually with half of this group recording no such prescrip-
tions. The mean supply of 5 days also shows appropriate dis-
cretion. However, even with a limited 5-day supply, up to 10%
of patients can become chronic opioid users at 1 year.20 The
evidence shows that each incremental increase in initial opi-
oid supply leads to a dramatic increase in the risk of depen-
dency.
Ophthalmology is a specialty in which a disproportionate
amount of care is provided to patients over age 65 years.21,22
Although opioid overdose rates are highest among people aged
25 to 54 years, chronic opioid abuse among older age groups
is a growing concern.23,24 This further underscores the impor-
tance of thoughtful opioid prescribing.
Conclusions
Our findings imply that ophthalmologists, as a group, tend to
prescribe opioids responsibly to their patients. Advance-
mentsinophthalmicsurgeryhavekeptopioidprescribingrates
stagnant across the profession while many other surgical spe-
cialties’rates continue to rise. However, the current epi-
demichighlightsthesubstantialriskofopioiddependencyeven
with seemingly innocuous prescribing patterns. The current
state of affairs should prompt health care professionals to con-
sider revisiting their protocols for opioid prescribing.
