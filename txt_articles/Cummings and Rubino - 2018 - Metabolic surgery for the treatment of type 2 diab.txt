Abstract
Several bariatric operations originally designed to promote weight loss have been found to powerfully treat type 2 diabetes, causing
remission in most cases, through diverse mechanisms additional to the secondary consequences of weight loss. These observations have
prompted consideration of such operations as ‘metabolic surgery’, used expressly to treat diabetes, including among patients who are
only mildly obese or merely overweight. Large, long-term observational studies consistently demonstrate that bariatric/metabolic surgery
is associated with reductions in all cardiovascular risk factors, actual cardiovascular events, microvascular diabetes complications, cancer
and death. Numerous recent randomised clinical trials, directly comparing various surgical vs non-surgical interventions for diabetes,
uniformly demonstrate the former to be superior for improvements in all glycaemic variables, as well as other metabolic endpoints. These
benefits are similar among individuals with type 2 diabetes and a preoperative BMI of 30–35 kg/m2 compared with traditional bariatric
surgery patients with a BMI >35 kg/m2. The safety profiles of modern laparoscopic bariatric/metabolic operations are similar to those of
elective laparoscopic hysterectomy and knee arthroplasty. However, more evidence regarding the risks, benefits and costs of surgery is
needed from very long-term (>5 year) randomised clinical trials powered to observe ‘hard’ clinical endpoints following the operations
most commonly used today. Given the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of metabolic surgery, the second Diabetes Surgery Summit
(DSS-II) consensus conference recently placed surgery squarely within the overall diabetes treatment algorithm, recommending con-
sideration of this approach for patients with inadequately controlled diabetes and a BMI as low as 30 kg/m2, or 27.5 kg/m2 for Asian
individuals. These new guidelines have been formally ratified by 53 leading diabetes and surgery societies worldwide. Given this broad
level of endorsement, we feel that the DSS-II recommendations should now replace the outdated National Institutes of Health (NIH)
suggestions that have governed bariatric surgery practice and insurance compensation worldwide since 1991.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes is an expanding pandemic afflicting more than
400 million people, with estimates of 650 million cases by
2040. Despite ever-increasing options for pharmaceutical
and lifestyle interventions, including medications recently
shown to reduce cardiovascular events, many patients with
diabetes fail to achieve glycaemic/metabolic treatment goals
designed to reduce micro- and macrovascular complications.
In the USA, only 52% of patients with type 2 diabetes main-
tain HbA1c <53 mmol/mol (<7%), and only 19% reach this
target along with LDL <5.6 mmol/l and blood pressure <130/
80 mmHg, as recommended to minimise cardiovascular mor-
bidity and mortality [1]. Implementing more effective strate-
gies to prevent and treat diabetes has become a top priority in
21st century medicine.
Recently, the second Diabetes Surgery Summit (DSS-II),
an international consensus conference, developed global
guidelines that recommend inclusion of bariatric/metabolic
surgery among glucose-lowering interventions for selected
patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity [2]. Endorsed thus
far by 53 organisations worldwide, including major national
diabetes and surgical societies, DSS-II guidelines were incor-
porated into the ADA Standards of Diabetes Care in 2017 [3].
This new guidance proposes that ‘metabolic surgery’ (involv-
ing procedures initially developed to treat obesity and dubbed
‘bariatric surgery’) should be considered as standard diabetes
treatment options for appropriate candidates with inadequate-
ly controlled type 2 diabetes and a BMI >30 kg/m2, or
>27.5 kg/m2 for Asian individuals. This conclusion is based
on biological and clinical rationales. For example, mechanistic
studies demonstrate that surgical manipulation of the gastro-
intestinal tract can exert powerful, beneficial effects on vari-
ous facets of glucose homeostasis, independent of weight loss
[4]. Moreover, a large body of clinical evidence, including
numerous randomised clinical trials, documents that surgery
improves blood glucose levels more effectively than any life-
style and/or pharmaceutical intervention, often yielding long-
term diabetes remission [5].
Inclusion of surgery among standard diabetes therapies
represents a significant step forward in diabetes care and re-
search. The mechanisms of metabolic surgery, albeit incom-
pletely understood, underscore important roles for the gut in
glucose homeostasis. Elucidating these mechanisms provides
opportunities to clarify type 2 diabetes pathogenesis, poten-
tially identifying targets for novel pharmacotherapeutics.
Leveraging insights provided by metabolic surgery, how-
ever, requires addressing practical and conceptual barriers,
including widespread misconceptions about bariatric surgery.
Despite compelling evidence of safety, efficacy and cost-ef-
fectiveness, using surgery as a diabetes intervention remained
controversial until very recently.
Herein we review evidence regarding the effects of meta-
bolic surgery in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes,
discussing the clinical, biological and economic rationales that
support expanding its use as part of modern multidisciplinary
approaches to diabetes care.
Biological rationale for considering
bariatric/metabolic surgery to treat type 2
diabetes
It has become clear that certain operations initially designed to
promote weight loss also powerfully improve glucose homeo-
stasis, leading to type 2 diabetes remission in most cases,
especially after procedures with intestinal bypass components
[5]. Although approximately one-third of patients who initial-
ly achieve diabetes remission after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
(RYGB) later experience relapse, the median disease-free pe-
riod for these individuals is 8.3 years [6]. Given the known
benefits of tight vs standard glycaemic control in early diabe-
tes on long-term cardiovascular disease (‘legacy effect’) [7, 8],
even among people whose diabetes relapses several years after
metabolic surgery, it is possible that this disease-free interval
will also yield long-term cardiovascular benefits in relapsed
individuals, especially in cases where initial diabetes duration
is relatively short. Although this has not yet been proven in
randomised clinical trials, very large, rigorously matched,
non-randomised studies have shown that metabolic surgery
is associated with long-term reductions in all cardiovascular
risk factors, actual cardiovascular events, cancer and death [5,
9–12].
It is also clear that many diabetes-associated benefits of
intestinal bypass operations, such as RYGB, result not only
from known effects of weight loss on glucose homeostasis
but also from diverse weight-independent glucose-lowering
mechanisms. Several large bodies of evidence demonstrate this
[13]. First, diabetes commonly remits very fast after surgery,
before significant weight loss. Second, for a given amount of
weight loss achieved with intestinal bypass surgery, larger im-
provements in glucose homeostasis and diabetes occur than
with equivalent weight loss achieved by dieting, exercise or
purely gastric-restrictive operations. Third, there is an inconsis-
tent relationship between the amount of weight lost after intes-
tinal bypass operations and the degree of diabetes remission,
prevention and relapse after initial remission, as well as with
rates of improvement in hard outcomes, such as heart attacks,
strokes, cancer and death. Fourth, experimental operations and
devices that replicate some of the intestinal physiology of met-
abolic operations, such as RYGB, without compromising
258
Diabetologia (2018) 61:257–264
 gastric capacity, can powerfully improve or eliminate type 2
diabetes with little or no weight loss, disengaging the weight-
reducing and glucose-lowering effects of surgery. Finally,
rare but illuminating cases of profound, late-onset
hyperinsulinaemic hypoglycaemia (occurring 1–26 years post-
operatively, typically at 2–4 years), sometimes requiring pan-
createctomy, suggest long-term post-surgical stimulation of be-
ta cell function and, possibly, mass. This latter point demon-
strates that, occasionally, the effectiveness of surgery for the
treatment of diabetes can be ‘too powerful’, something that
would never occur with non-surgical weight loss.
A partial list of mechanisms mediating weight-independent
glucose-lowering effects of gastrointestinal surgery is shown
in the text box below. Although many of these specific mech-
anisms have only been demonstrated thus far in animals, com-
pelling evidence indicates that metabolic surgery engages
weight-independent glucose-lowering processes in humans
[4]. This has important clinical implications because, although
individuals with a lower BMI lose less weight postoperatively
than do the severely obese, they still experience these weight-
independent glucose-lowering effects. Accordingly, the bene-
fits of bariatric/metabolic surgery for type 2 diabetes appear to
be similar among people with a preoperative BMI <35 kg/m2
to those with a BMI ≥35 kg/m2 [14], the traditional cut-off for
bariatric surgery in patients with diabetes (see below).
Admittedly, evidence for this assertion is limited for patients
with a preoperative BMI <30 kg/m2.
The existence of weight-independent glucose-lowering
mechanisms activated by traditional ‘bariatric’ operations, along
with the profound clinical benefits of these procedures on type 2
diabetes (including among non-severely obese individuals), has
prompted increasing consideration of surgery to treat diabetes
per se as the primary intent, even among patients who are only
mildly obese or merely overweight [15]. Hence, the term ‘met-
abolic surgery’ is becoming increasingly popular, and virtually
every bariatric surgery society in the world has changed its name
within the past several years to include the word ‘metabolic’.
Clinical rationale for considering metabolic
surgery to treat type 2 diabetes
Several large, long-term observational studies have uniformly
shown that, compared with people receiving non-surgical care
for obesity and diabetes, those who elect to undergo bariatric/
metabolic surgery demonstrate greater improvements in body
weight, glycaemic control, diabetes remission, other cardiovas-
cular risk factors, microvascular complications, heart attacks,
strokes, cancer and death [5, 9–12]. Nine studies show reductions
in all-cause mortality among patients who have undergone
bariatric/metabolic surgery [5, 11, 16, 17], including a remark-
able 92% decrease in diabetes-related deaths [17], and none have
failed to observe this. Because these studies are not randomised
clinical trials, however, potential unmeasured confounders are a
concern. Perhaps people who elect to undergo a major interven-
tion, such as surgery, are more motivated to maintain other
healthy behaviours, such as changing their diet, exercising, ceas-
ing smoking, seeing their doctors, taking medications, etc.
To address these concerns about unmeasured confounders in
non-randomised studies, 11 recent randomised clinical trials
have directly compared surgical vs non-surgical diabetes inter-
ventions. A DSS-II meta-analysis of these trials found almost
universal results among them [2, 5]. Compared with a wide
variety of medical/lifestyle interventions, the four most com-
monly performed bariatric/metabolic operations (see below)
consistently yielded superior improvements in body weight, all
glycaemic measures (diabetes remission, glycaemic control, di-
abetes medication use, etc.), HDL and triacylglycerol levels, the
metabolic syndrome, quality of life and overall medication use.
These benefits were associated with acceptable complications
and nosurgical deaths todate (including follow-upof 1–5 years),
among the 1050 surgical participants included. These findings
represent nearly unanimous level 1a evidence from the meta-
analysis of randomised clinical trials, including data on many
patients with a preoperative BMI <35 kg/m2. Surgical patients
also tended to experience greater improvements in LDL levels
and hypertension than did non-surgical participants in these
randomised clinical trials, although these differences were not
as profound or consistent as the results for diabetes-related var-
iables [2, 5, 18].
Favourable changes in gut hormones
a) Increased GLP-1 secretion and, hence,  
insulin (plus augmented postprandial peptide  
YY (PYY) and oxyntomodulin levels, contrib-
uting to weight loss)
b) In some cases, compromised secretion of 
the diabetes-promoting peptide ghrelin 
Favourable changes in bile acid signalling
Increased glucose metabolism by the small 
intestine
Changes in intestinal nutrient sensing that 
improve insulin sensitivity, through both neural 
and humoral pathways
Reduced intestinal glucose transport via SGLT1
Reduced circulating branched-chain amino 
acids
Possible alterations in gut microbiota (although 
evidence is stronger for a role in weight loss 
than in improved glucose homeostasis)

 Evidence for use of surgery to treat type 2
diabetes in patients with a BMI less than vs
greater than 35 kg/m2
Traditionally, bariatric surgery is only permitted in people
with type 2 diabetes if their BMI is ≥35 kg/m2. This threshold
is increasingly being challenged when considering metabolic
surgery for diabetes. A recent meta-analysis of all published
studies reporting on diabetes remission after bariatric/
metabolic surgery (including 94,579 surgical patients) showed
that remission rates were equivalent in the 60 investigations in
which mean baseline BMI of the study cohorts was ≥35 kg/m2
and the 34 studies including participants with mean baseline
BMI <35 kg/m2 (71% vs 72%, respectively) [19].
Similarly, the previously mentioned meta-analysis of 11
existing randomised clinical trials directly comparing various
surgical vs non-surgical approaches to type 2 diabetes treat-
ment found that the degree to which surgery out-performed
medical/lifestyle interventions for diabetes remission and/or
glycaemic control was equivalent among the five randomised
clinical trials in which mean baseline BMI of the study cohorts
was <35 kg/m2 compared with the six randomised clinical
trials with mean participant baseline BMI ≥35 kg/m2 (Fig. 1)
[14].
Furthermore, according to a comprehensive comparative ef-
fectiveness analysis by the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Quality (AHRQ), the safety of bariatric/metabolic surgery is at
least as good for patients with a preoperative BMI <35 kg/m2 as
for those with baseline BMI ≥35 kg/m2 [20].
The similar efficacy and safety of metabolic surgery to treat
type 2 diabetes in patients with a preoperative BMI above vs
below 35 kg/m2 indicates that this arbitrary threshold,
established 26 years ago by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) to determine surgical eligibility, is not well supported
by extant evidence [21].
Safety of metabolic surgery for type 2
diabetes
Bariatric/metabolic surgery has become progressively safer
over the past two decades, largely owing to the refinement
of minimally invasive techniques. The vast majority of oper-
ations are now performed laparoscopically, with surgical mor-
tality rates ten times less than for equivalent open operations
[22]. Perioperative mortality rates from bariatric/metabolic
surgery are less than those from laparoscopic cholecystectomy
or appendectomy, and similar to elective laparoscopic hyster-
ectomy and knee arthroplasty [23]. The perioperative compli-
cation rate for laparoscopic RYGB in a recent US National
Registry is 3.4%, which is less than that for laparoscopic hys-
terectomy, cholecystectomy or appendectomy [23].
All operations involve risk, and the most common long-
term complications of bariatric/metabolic surgery are listed in
the text box below [5]. Among the most frequent of these, iron
deficiency can be chronic and sometimes requires repeated
iron infusions. In addition, the incidence of less frequent but
very serious adverse outcomes, for example suicide, acciden-
tal injuries and alcohol abuse, is substantially higher after
some operations, with relative risk rates increasing by two-
to threefold [5]. There is also considerable concern about
long-term risks after certain procedures (especially those in-
volving intestinal bypasses) on metabolic bone disease, oste-
oporosis and fracture rates. Definitive evidence regarding
these hazards is incomplete.
Importantly, these potential complications must be
weighed against possible adverse consequences of not having
surgery, such as typically remaining obese, continuing to have
diabetes and taking glucose-lowering medications (which can
cause hypoglycaemia, weight gain, and other problems). As
stated above, all nine existing published studies of overall
long-term mortality among patients who have undergone
bariatric/metabolic surgery have reported that death rates are
reduced compared with those in non-surgical controls [5, 11,
16, 17]. The aforementioned comprehensive AHRQ review of
surgical vs non-surgical approaches to metabolic conditions,
such as diabetes, concluded that adverse events of surgery
were relatively low and that most surgical complications were
minor and tended not to require major intervention [20].
Economic rationale for considering metabolic
surgery to treat type 2 diabetes
Although only some studies show bariatric/metabolic surgery
to be outright cost-saving, all studies find it cost-effective, with
a price per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of
~US$5000–10,000, well below the commonly accepted
standard of US$50,000/QALY for affordable healthcare
Iron deficiency (45–52%)
Vitamin B12 deficiency (8–37%)
Vitamin D ‘deficiency’ (51%)
Anaemia (15%)

 interventions [24, 25]. The cost-effectiveness of surgery is
greater among people with diabetes than in those without it
[25]. By comparison, as examples of non-surgical diabetes
treatments, intensive medicinal glycaemic and lipid control cost
US$41,384/QALY and US$51,889/QALY, respectively [26].
An important caveat is that most economic analyses of
bariatric/metabolic surgery derive from modelling studies, rath-
er than direct measurements within randomised clinical trials.
The time to return-on-investment for surgery varies widely
among studies, from only a few years to as many as 9 years (or
not observed within the period of follow-up). However, it is
likely that the cost of bariatric/metabolic operations is fully
repaid at some point after surgery if patients live long enough,
from savings on medications not taken, hospitalisations
avoided, complications not suffered, etc. Hence, insurance
plans that typically retain patients for a long time (e.g. the
Veterans Health Administration) should ultimately recoup
the entire cost of surgery. Moreover, if all insurance plans
covered bariatric/metabolic surgery, long-term healthcare
costs for the entire system would decrease. Similar benefits
would be observed in public healthcare systems, such as the
UK National Health Service (NHS).
Choosing the appropriate operation for type
2 diabetes
Bariatric/metabolic operations that are currently in clinical use
include RYGB (48% of bariatric/metabolic surgery
worldwide), vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG, 42%), laparo-
scopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB, 8%) and
biliopancreatic diversion (BPD, 2%). The order of effective-
ness for weight loss and diabetes improvement is
BPD>RYGB>VSG>LAGB. The opposite order applies for
safety.
By far, the most commonly used operations are RYGB and
VSG, with VSG having overtaken RYGB in many nations.
However, RYGB is more effective against diabetes and is
considered by many as the gold standard operation for patients
with this disease.
Novel bariatric/metabolic operations and devices are pres-
ently under development, including: (1) proximal intestinal
bypass procedures for type 2 diabetes (e.g., duodenal-jejunal
bypass surgery, endoscopically implanted endoluminal
sleeves and endoscopic duodenal mucosal resurfacing); (2)
ileal interposition surgery to enhance distal intestinal nutrient
stimulation of L-cell peptide secretion; and (3) endoscopic
techniques to reduce gastric volume for weight loss (e.g.
new-generation gastric balloons, gastric plication and gastric
electrical stimulation). Most of these approaches are currently
used primarily in clinical trials.
Evidence gaps in metabolic surgery research
Although the mechanistic and clinical databases supporting a
role for metabolic surgery in the overall diabetes treatment
algorithm have burgeoned in recent years, including highly

 consistent level 1a evidence from randomised clinical trials
directly comparing surgical vs non-surgical approaches, many
key domains warrant additional research. Prominent among
these are the following:
1.
Long-term (>5 year) results from randomised clinical tri-
als regarding durability of glycaemic improvements are
lacking. Efforts are underway to redress this gap, such
as the Alliance of Randomized Trials of Medicine vs
Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes (ARMMS-T2D;
ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT02328599)
consortium randomised clinical trial.
2.
Longer-term data (>10 years) are needed on efficacy and
safety using non-randomised studies examining the oper-
ations currently performed. Although the superlative
Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study database [9] is very
large and extremely long term (and the most cited study of
this nature in this field), it is primarily derived from ob-
servations in people with vertical-banded gastroplasty,
which has not been used for decades, and LAGB, which
is now seldom performed. Comparatively few patients
underwent RYGB in this study and none had VSG, yet
these two operations constitute 90% of bariatric/metabolic
surgery currently performed.
3.
Level 1 evidence is needed from randomised clinical trials
sufficiently powered and of long enough duration to mea-
sure hard outcomes, such as microvascular and/or
macrovascular events, cancer, death, etc.
4.
More evidence is warranted regarding the long-term risks
after intestinal bypass operations for metabolic bone
disease, osteoporosis and fractures, especially from oper-
ations most commonly performed today.
5.
We need true cost-effectiveness data from large
randomised clinical trials, rather than just modelling
methodologies.
6.
Now that modern diabetes medications such as glucagon-
like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and sodium–glucose
cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors have been shown to
confer cardiovascular protection in large trials, these
newer agents need to be directly compared against meta-
bolic surgery in randomised clinical trials with ‘hard’
endpoints.
7.
Level 1 evidence is needed regarding the long-term
(>5 year) rates of weight regain and diabetes recurrence
after VSG, which is now the most commonly performed
bariatric/metabolic operation in many nations.
8.
It is likely that the combination of metabolic surgery and
intensive medical/lifestyle treatment is the most effective
strategy for diabetes control, and further research on the
details of combining these approaches is warranted.

 2 diabetes management [27, 28]. This helped generate
funding to develop the evidence highlighted here.
Based on this evidence, in 2015/2016 a panel of 48
international diabetes experts, representing numerous
major worldwide diabetes societies, utilised a formal
Delphi-like consensus-development process to generate
new guidelines regarding the use and study of metabolic
surgery for type 2 diabetes. Their recommendations
were finalized at the DSS-II and, subsequently, codified
in numerous related publications.
The 32 new DSS-II consensus statements and guidelines
identify metabolic surgery as a standard option in the type 2
diabetes treatment algorithm (Fig. 2) [2]. With very high con-
sensus, the delegates recommended that surgery should be con-
sidered to treat inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes in people
with a BMI as low as 30 kg/m2 (vs the prior NIH cut-off of
35 kg/m2), or as low as 27.5 kg/m2 in Asian patients. Although
this change in BMI threshold is a modest numerical modifica-
tion, it encompasses a very large number of people. In the USA,
~43% of individuals with diabetes have a BMI of 30–35 kg/m2
[1] and, worldwide, the vast majority of people with diabetes
have a BMI <35 kg/m2, including >98% of East Asian individ-
uals [29].
The DSS-II final recommendations have been formally
ratified by 52 international societies thus far, including the
ADA, the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the
Chinese Diabetes Society, Diabetes India, the European
Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO), the
Endocrine Society, the American Association of Clinical
Endocrinologists (AACE), The Obesity Society and the
American Gastroenterological Association (AGA), as well
as the national diabetes organisations of many European
and South American countries [2]. Hopefully, with this
high degree of vetting and worldwide endorsement, these
new guidelines will finally replace the seriously outdated
1991 NIH recommendations that have governed global
practice and insurance compensation of bariatric surgery
for more than a quarter of a century [21].

Duality of interest
DEC is a principal investigator on the Comparison of
Surgery vs Medicine for Indian Diabetes (COSMID) randomised clinical
trial, which is funded by Johnson & Johnson, as well as the Alliance of
Randomized Trials of Medicine vs Metabolic Surgery in Type 2 Diabetes
(ARMMS-T2D) randomised clinical trial, which has previously been
sponsored in part by Johnson & Johnson plus Covidien, but is now fully
funded by the NIH. FR declares that there is no duality of interest asso-
ciated with this manuscript.
Contribution statement
DEC drafted the manuscript, and both authors
revised it critically for important intellectual content. Both authors ap-
proved the version to be published.
