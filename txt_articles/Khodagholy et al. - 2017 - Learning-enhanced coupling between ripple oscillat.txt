Abstract
Consolidation of declarative memories requires hippocampal-neocortical communication. 
Although experimental evidence supports the role of sharp-wave ripples in transferring 
hippocampal information to the neocortex, the exact cortical destinations and the physiological 
mechanisms of such transfer are not known. We used a conducting polymer-based conformable 
microelectrode array (NeuroGrid) to record local field potentials and neural spiking across the 
dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, combined with silicon probe recordings in the 
hippocampus, to identify candidate physiological patterns. Parietal, midline, and prefrontal, but 
not primary cortical areas, displayed localized ripple (100 to 150 hertz) oscillations during sleep, 
concurrent with hippocampal ripples. Coupling between hippocampal and neocortical ripples was 
strengthened during sleep following learning. These findings suggest that ripple-ripple coupling 
supports hippocampal-association cortical transfer of memory traces.
Association neocortex is an evolutionarily recent type of cortex characterized by higher-
order neural circuits that mediate multi-modal, advanced information processing related to 
cognition. A key unifying feature of association cortices is their strong reciprocal anatomical 
and functional connectivity with medial temporal lobe structures (1–3). This connectivity is 
required for consolidation of declarative memory, which involves the transfer of information 
rapidly encoded in the hippocampus to long-term storage (4–6). Consolidation of 
hippocampus-dependent memory is accompanied by increased immediate early gene 
expression and structural changes in neural networks of association cortices (7). High-

 frequency, synchronous hippocampal oscillations, called ripples, are implicated in mediating 
memory consolidation by distributing compressed representations of waking experience to 
interconnected cortical networks during periods of quiescence or slow-wave sleep (4, 8, 9). 
Hippocampal ripples have been temporally linked to cortical sleep spindles and patterned 
neuronal firing in certain association cortices (10–12). Occurrence of hippocampal ripples is 
likewise influenced by ongoing cortical oscillations (13) and is linked to whole-brain 
patterns of activation and deactivation over an extended time scale relative to ripple duration 
(14).
We developed a conducting polymer-based conformable microelectrode array [NeuroGrid 
(15, 16)] capable of recording local field potentials (LFP) and neural spiking across the 
dorsal cortical surface of the rat brain, enabling large-scale electrophysiological monitoring 
without sacrificing spatiotemporal resolution. A combination of these large-scale 
NeuroGrids (Fig. 1A), with high-density NeuroGrids and penetrating silicon probes, allowed 
us to investigate hippocampal-neocortical communication in behaving rats (n = 16 rats). We 
first compared the relationship between hippocampal and neocortical activity across the 
dorsal cortical surface during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (n = 3 rats with large-
scale NeuroGrids). Both hippocampus and neocortex exhibited characteristic LFP patterns 
including delta waves, spindles, and gamma activity (Fig. 1B). Bursts of transient high-
frequency activity (“ripples”; 100 to 150 Hz) were prominent in the hippocampus (Fig. 1B, 
H traces). Unexpectedly, a subset of neocortical electrodes also displayed transient epochs of 
oscillatory activity in the ripple band (Fig. 1B and fig. S1). The large-scale and spatially 
continuous coverage of the NeuroGrid enabled us to identify the anatomical locations of the 
ripple-generating cortical areas. Sensory evoked potentials were used to provide physiologic 
landmarks for primary sensory areas. Ripple oscillations were only exceptionally observed 
in primary somatosensory, visual, or motor cortices (occurrence rate <0.05 Hz) but were 
prevalent in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and midline structures (M), such as cingulate 
and retrosplenial cortices (rate: 0.1 to 0.5 Hz) (Fig. 1C and fig. S2; P < 10−18). To further 
characterize the relationship among the neocortical areas, we examined interregional, cross-
frequency power coupling “comodulograms” (17, 18) of the surface-recorded signals. 
Power-power coupling in the ripple band was high between PPC and midline structures, but 
low when primary sensory areas were included in the comparison (Fig. 1D). This 
dissociation was not present in other frequency bands, where power coupling was present in 
all comparisons. These findings suggested that ripple activity is a characteristic feature of 
association cortices. We thus investigated the presence of ripples in the medial prefrontal 
cortex (mPFC) using implantable probes across cortical layers of this region in three 
additional rats (19). Ripples were also present in the mPFC with rates of occurrence similar 
to those of PPC or midline structures (fig. S4, B and C).
Hippocampal ripples during NREM sleep often had a close temporal association with 
cortical ripples (Fig. 2A). The comodulograms of PPC and mPFC with hippocampus 
confirmed that cortical ripple band activity was coupled with the hippocampal ripple band 
and also revealed relationships with spindle band activity (Fig. 2B). We investigated the 
timing relationships between cortical ripples and characteristic NREM oscillations. The 
occurrence of hippocampal and cortical ripples was temporally coupled (Fig. 2C, left), with 
13.5 ± 1.9% of hippocampal ripples co-occurring with cortical ripples within a window of

 ±50 ms (n = 10 rats). Cortical ripple events also had a significant cross-correlation with 
cortical spindles at 200 to 500 ms before the peak of spindle power, similar to the coupling 
observed between hippocampal ripples and cortical spindles (Fig. 2C, right, and fig. S4, C 
and D). Filtering LFP at delta frequency (0.5 to 4 Hz) surrounding cortical ripples (±2 s) 
demonstrated that cortical ripples tended to occur at the transition from “down” to “up” 
states of the cortical slow oscillation (Fig. 2D), which organizes NREM sleep into epochs of 
neural spiking and oscillatory activity, alternating with epochs of relative neural quiescence 
(13, 20, 21).
Next, we focused on the spatial extent and physiological features of PPC ripples using high-
density NeuroGrids (fig. S6A, n = 10 rats). PPC ripples had a mean peak frequency of 146 
± 5 Hz and a median duration of 53 ± 20 ms (fig. S6, B and C). PPC ripple occurrence was 
highest in NREM sleep (0.50 ± 0.2 events per second), intermediate during quiet 
wakefulness (0.10 ± 0.02 events per second), and low during REM sleep (0.01 ± 0.04 events 
per second; n = 9 sessions from 3 rats). PPC ripples were seen simultaneously over a 
maximum of 1 mm2 of cortical surface (Fig. 3, A and B). Oscillations with peak frequencies 
ranging from 50 to 150 Hz have been described in rodent cortex during REM sleep, as well 
as in human cortex (22–24). We identified oscillations in our data with a peak frequency of 
70 to 80 Hz that were distinct from cortical ripples in regard to time of occurrence, coupling 
with hippocampal ripples, and anatomical distribution (fig. S7), suggesting that different 
types of high-frequency oscillations coexist in the neocortex.
Ripple oscillations were associated with localized cortical neural firing, and larger-amplitude 
ripples had stronger spike entrainment (Fig. 3, C and D). In keeping with our ability to 
detect ripple-entrained neural firing with NeuroGrids from the cortical surface, LFP ripple 
power was confined to supragranular layers (Fig. 3E and fig. S4B). A large fraction of 
superficial neurons exhibited significant rate modulation during cortical ripples, and the 
strength of rate modulation was not strictly determined by baseline firing rate (Fig. 3F, 
vertical line). We clustered neural spikes into putative pyramidal cells and interneurons using 
a combination of waveform shape and firing rate (fig. S6E). Both cell types demonstrated 
entrained firing to cortical ripple oscillations, with preferred phases of firing (Fig. 3, G and 
H). The majority of putative pyramidal cells and interneurons (58% ± 4 and 49% ± 5, 
respectively; n = 3 sessions from 3 rats, recorded by both NeuroGrids and silicon probes) 
were significantly phase-locked to cortical ripples, with the pyramidal cells leading 
interneurons (Fig. 3I), similar to patterned firing observed with hippocampal ripples (25, 
26).
Hippocampal-cortical interactions are believed to be critical for consolidation of 
hippocampal-dependent memory tasks (5, 8, 20). Both hippocampus and PPC are involved 
in supporting components of spatial behaviors, and PPC likely serves as a cortical 
integration site for hippocampally generated allocentric spatial information and egocentric 
spatial orientation to permit goal-directed navigation (27–30). Therefore, we asked whether 
and how cortical ripples are affected by spatial learning. Of the 10 rats implanted with a 
high-density NeuroGrid above the PPC and a silicon probe in the hippocampus, six were 
trained on a hippocampus-dependent cheeseboard maze task (31), and the remaining four 
rats served as a control group that did not undergo task learning but explored an open maze

 prior to sleep (Fig. 4A). Electrophysiological recordings were first performed in the home 
cage during a period of intermixed free behavior and sleep to establish average oscillation 
occurrence and coupling for each rat. Subsequently, the rats were initiated on the behavioral 
protocol, and we recorded during three sleep sessions in the home cage after each phase of 
the task: (i) postexploration sleep (SE): after free exploration of a cheeseboard maze with 
randomly placed water rewards; (ii) postlearning sleep 1 (S1): after first training session to 
retrieve water rewards from three locations on the same cheeseboard maze; and (iii) 
postlearning sleep 2 (S2): after second training session for the same three reward locations 
(Fig. 4A). The control group of rats (n = 4) was recorded during postexploration sleep only 
on consecutive days of exploration (SE) and did not advance through the learning portion of 
the protocol. Long-term memory for the reward locations was quantified by testing the rats’ 
retrieval of rewards from the three locations 24 hours after training (test); all rats had >90% 
performance as scored by ability to retrieve three water rewards per trial during the first 30-s 
access to the maze. Five training days (two training sessions per day) were recorded from 
each rat. Reward locations varied daily to induce new spatial learning (32).
The overall sleep structure was similar across the sleep sessions as characterized by the 
occurrence rates of neocortical spindles, hippocampal and cortical ripples, and NREM 
power spectra (fig. S8). By contrast, the strength of coupling between hippocampal and PPC 
ripples showed significant changes after different experiences (Fig. 4B). Hippocampal-PPC 
ripple coupling increased during postlearning sleep compared to postexploration sleep, a 
trend that was consistent across all six trained rats. Furthermore, multiple consecutive 
sessions of exploration in the control rats did not induce a change in hippocampal-PPC 
ripple coupling, and these coupling values were significantly less than those in trained rats 
(fig. S9, P = 0.02). The magnitude of coupling in the trained rats was also stronger after the 
second training session compared to after the first training session, demonstrating that the 
amount of training correlated with the strength of hippocampal-PPC ripple coupling (Fig. 
4C).
In this study, we have identified ripple frequency oscillations that were present in association 
but not in primary sensory cortical areas. These association areas, including parietal, 
retrosplenial, anterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortex, are reciprocally anatomically 
and functionally connected with medial temporal lobe structures (1, 2) and exhibit extensive 
cortico-cortical connections (33). Hippocampal and neo-cortical ripples co-occur in these 
areas, reflecting either a direct hippocampal–entorhinal cortex–neocortex excitation (10, 14) 
or an indirect common drive by cortical slow oscillations (12, 20, 34, 35). The coordination 
of cortical ripples with “down” to “up” state transitions, and the correlation of both 
hippocampal and cortical ripples with sleep spindles, suggests that cortical ripples may form 
part of the hippocampal-cortical dialogue during NREM sleep. Following induction of long-
term hippocampal-dependent memory, coupling of hippocampal and neocortical ripples 
increased significantly. Analogous to hippocampal ripples, cortical ripples may signify 
information transfer involving association cortex. Overall, our findings suggest that ripple 
oscillation mechanisms of NREM sleep in both hippocampal and neocortical association 
areas support memory consolidation. Note added in proof: After our manuscript went in 
press, a paper relevant to the findings presented here was published (36).

calculated as the ratio of the cross-correlogram peak [“a” in panel (B); maximal value within 
±50 ms] to the baseline of the cross-correlogram [“b” in panel (B); midpoint of upper and 
lower boundary of 95% confidence interval averaged over 10 s of cross-correlation]. 
Normalized coupling modulation was calculated by subtracting the average coupling 
strength of hippocampal and PPC ripples during sleep before initiation of behavior protocol 
from the coupling strength obtained during SE, S1, and S2 for each rat (pooled over 5 days of 
training). Edges of the large diamond plot correspond to −1 standard error, median, and +1 
standard error (from bottom to top), with embedded square representing the mean; whiskers 
show minimum and maximum values (n = 6, Kruskal–Wallis test; P = 0.013, Bonferroni 
correction; *P < 0.05 between groups as determined by post-hoc testing). Blue diamonds 
show values for individual rats.
