Patients with advanced cancer often succumb to complications arising from striated muscle wasting associated
with cachexia. Excessive activation of the type IIB activin receptor (ActRIIB) is considered an important mech-
anism underlying this wasting, where circulating procachectic factors bind ActRIIB and ultimately lead to the
phosphorylation of SMAD2/3. Therapeutics that antagonize the binding of ActRIIB ligands are in clinical devel-
opment, but concerns exist about achieving efficacy without off-target effects. To protect striated muscle from
harmful ActRIIB signaling, and to reduce the risk of off-target effects, we developed an intervention using re-
combinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV vectors) that increase expression of Smad7 in skeletal and car-
diac muscles. SMAD7 acts as an intracellular negative regulator that prevents SMAD2/3 activation and
promotes degradation of ActRIIB complexes. In mouse models of cachexia, rAAV:Smad7 prevented wasting
of skeletal muscles and the heart independent of tumor burden and serum levels of procachectic ligands.
Mechanistically, rAAV:Smad7 administration abolished SMAD2/3 signaling downstream of ActRIIB and inhibited
expression of the atrophy-related ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx. These findings identify muscle-directed
Smad7 gene delivery as a potential approach for preventing muscle wasting under conditions where excessive
ActRIIB signaling occurs, such as cancer cachexia.
INTRODUCTION
Cachexia, a state of pronounced weight loss, frailty, and fatigue that is
characterized by severe atrophy of muscle and fat, affects up to 80% of
patients with advanced solid cancers (1). Cachexia is a strong indicator
of poor prognosis and reduced survival, because progressively debili-
tating frailty ultimately deprives patients of independent movement
and respiratory function and also reduces tolerance for aggressive
chemotherapy regimens (2). Current care measures for cachexia large-
ly focus on nutritional supplementation, prescription of appetite stim-
ulants and anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids (although these
drugs can cause muscle wasting), and physical therapy to promote ac-
tivity (2). However, although anorexia and reduced activity contribute
to the exacerbation of cachexia in chronically ill individuals, tumor-
and host-derived factors that drive catabolic signaling in muscle and
adipose tissue are considered the primary cause of cachexia onset and
progression (3). Consequently, developing interventions that target the
effects of procachectic ligands is considered the best prospect for
preventing or reversing cachexia.
Of the various secreted factors associated with cachexia to date,
much interest has developed around the therapeutic prospects of
inhibiting type IIB activin receptor (ActRIIB) ligands—in particular,
myostatin, activins, and growth/differentiation factor 11 (GDF11)—
because this pathway stimulates muscle catabolism, and expression
of ActRIIB ligands is elevated under conditions associated with muscle
wasting (3–5). Antibodies against myostatin have shown some capac-
ity to ameliorate muscle wasting in animal studies, although effects are
modest, likely because they do not inhibit the activity of other ActRIIB
ligands that can be simultaneously elevated in cachectic patients’ ser-
um and tissues. As a strategy to antagonize multiple ligands, admin-
istration of ligand traps, such as soluble forms of modified ActRIIB,
has been shown to reverse muscle wasting and increase life span in
animal models of cachexia, despite elevated circulating levels of pro-
cachectic cytokines (6). However, in 2011, phase 2 clinical trials of a
soluble ActRIIB receptor–based intervention that targeted circulating
ActRIIB ligands (to combat frailty associated with a form of muscular
dystrophy) were terminated owing to safety concerns (7). Although
the significance of the associated off-target effects remains a subject
of discussion, it is generally acknowledged that targeting the interac-
tion between circulating ligands and ActRIIB receptors may disrupt
critical processes in many organ systems, including vascular remodel-
ing, inflammatory regulation, and reproduction (8, 9). Thus, findings
to date suggest that interventions that prevent ActRIIB signaling could
prove instrumental in treating muscle wasting such as that associated
with cachexia, but need to target signaling selectively in muscle to
minimize the probability of evoking off-target effects.
Once activated, ActRIIB recruits type I activin receptors (ActRI, also
known as ALK4/7, encoded for by ACVR1b/1c) to form an activated
ActRIIB:ActRI complex that phosphorylates SMAD2/3 (8). These re-
ceptor SMAD proteins repress protein synthesis by inhibiting the
Akt/mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway (10)
and also translocate to the nucleus in complex with SMAD4 to pro-
mote a transcriptional program that increases protein degradation. The
transcriptional response also up-regulates expression of the inhibitory

 protein SMAD7 as a form of intracellular negative feedback that prevents
SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and promotes ActRIIB complex degrada-
tion (11). We hypothesized that using recombinant adeno-associated
viral vectors (rAAV vectors) to genetically increase SMAD7 abundance
in striated muscle could ameliorate muscle wasting by attenuating
ActRIIB signaling, without the known side effects of soluble ligand
traps. rAAV vectors have been demonstrated to be useful tools for ther-
apeutic gene delivery, owing to their propensity for achieving efficacious
and targeted delivery of transgenes to the skeletal muscles of mammals
(12), including humans (13, 14), that can sustain gene expression for
more than a decade after a single treatment (14). Our preclinical studies
demonstrate that the overexpression of Smad7 in the striated muscle of
mice enhances muscle mass and function and prevents wasting in rodent
models of cancer cachexia.
RESULTS
Increasing expression of Smad7 promotes skeletal muscle
hypertrophy in mice
We chose rAAV6 for delivering Smad7 because it has strong tropism
for striated muscle (12). Injection of the tibialis anterior (TA) hind-
limb muscles of C57BL/6 mice with rAAV6 vectors (12, 15) carrying
a Smad7 expression cassette (rAAV6:Smad7) elicited a ~45% increase
in TA muscle mass within 28 days of injection (Fig. 1A), concomitant
with increases in SMAD7 protein expression that considerably ex-
ceeded endogenous SMAD7 abundance (Fig. 1B) and increases in myo-
fiber diameter (Fig. 1C). Systemic administration of rAAV6:Smad7
promoted hypertrophy of skeletal muscles body-wide (Fig. 1D), which
recapitulated the increases in myofiber diameter observed after local
injection of rAAV6:Smad7 (fig. S1A). As expected, owing to rAAV6
vector tropism (12), SMAD7 was expressed in skeletal muscles and
the heart (Fig. 1E), but not visceral organs (fig. S1B). We have previous-
ly modulated the transforming growth factor–b (TGFb) network using
interventions that are more potent than Smad7 (for example, follistatin
isoforms) and found no changes in myofiber number, or evidence of
altered nonmuscle content to support the occurrence of remodeling
events in adult muscle (16). Thus, we did not evaluate those outcomes
in this study.
SMAD3S432/435 phosphorylation was potently suppressed in muscles
administered rAAV6:Smad7 (Fig. 1F), indicating marked inhibition of
SMAD2/3 signaling when SMAD7 is increased. Moreover, the hyper-
trophic effects of rAAV6:Smad7 treatment were abolished when
muscles were coadministered rAAV6:Smad7 with rAAV6 expressing
a constitutively active (CA) form of SMAD3, rAAV6:Smad3-CA (Fig.
1, G and H) (17). The coadministration of vectors did not affect expres-
sion of transgenes, compared with administration of individual vectors
(fig. S1C).
To investigate the mechanisms of Smad7-mediated muscle growth,
we examined processes associated with protein synthesis and degrada-
tion. SMAD7 overexpression in muscles increased fractional protein
synthesis rates (fig. S2A) concomitant with increased phosphorylation
of S6 ribosomal protein (S6RPS235/236) and eukaryotic translation ini-
tiation factor 4E–binding protein 1 (4EBP1T37/46)—key modulators of
protein synthesis that are responsive to mTOR activation (fig. S2B).
However, we did not detect altered Akt phosphorylation or activity
(fig. S2, B and C). Repeated treatment of mice with rapamycin (an
inhibitor of mTOR) did not suppress muscle hypertrophy induced
by rAAV6:Smad7 administration (fig. S2D) but prevented phospho-
rylation of S6RP and 4EBP1 in Smad7-treated muscles (fig. S2E).
Subsequently, we investigated whether the anabolic effects of
rAAV6:Smad7 were associated with altered proteolysis. Muscles
administered rAAV6:Smad7 exhibited attenuated transcription of
MuRF1 and MAFbx (fig. S2F), two E3 ubiquitin ligases that have been
identified as key mediators of proteasome-based protein degradation in
muscle. Furthermore, the overexpression of Smad7 prevented Smad3-
mediated transcription of MuRF1 and MAFbx (fig. S2G). Together,
these data demonstrate that administering rAAV6:Smad7 to healthy
muscles promotes hypertrophy by shifting the balance between protein
synthesis and degradation independent of mTOR activity.
Smad7 delivery prevents myostatin- and activin-induced
muscle atrophy
We hypothesized that SMAD7 promotes skeletal muscle hypertrophy
in part by suppressing the activation of SMAD2/3 by the ActRIIB ligands
myostatin and activin. Administering rAAV6:Smad7 to the TA muscles
of both wild-type and myostatin-null mice (Mstn−/−) increased TA
muscle mass (Fig. 2A) and myofiber size (Fig. 2B) and reduced SMAD3
phosphorylation relative to muscles receiving control vector (Fig. 2C).
However, the relative increase in muscle mass as a consequence of
treatment was tempered in Mstn−/− mice, relative to wild-type litter-
mates (Fig. 2D). The comparatively diminished hypertrophic action
of rAAV6:Smad7 in mice lacking myostatin is consistent with the
fact that additional ActRIIB ligands (for example, activin and
GDF11) act in concert with myostatin to negatively regulate muscle
mass (18, 19).
Because elevated levels of the ActRIIB ligands myostatin and acti-
vinhave been shown to cause muscle wasting inmice by driving excessive
SMAD2/3 signaling (20), we examined whether increased expression of
Smad7 could protect muscles from myostatin- and activin-induced at-
rophy. Direct injection of mouse limb muscles with rAAV6 vectors
expressing either myostatin (Mstn) or activin A (Act A) reduced TA
mass (Fig. 2, E and F) concomitant with increased phosphorylation
of SMAD3 (Fig. 2, G and H). Muscles overexpressing myostatin or ac-
tivin were protected from atrophy and excessive SMAD2/3 signaling
when coadministered rAAV6:Smad7 (Fig. 2, E and F). These data dem-
onstrate that SMAD7 can inhibit the actions of different ActRIIB lig-
ands acting upon skeletal muscles.
Smad7 delivery prevents muscle wasting associated with
cancer cachexia
Because ActRIIB signaling is hypothesized to contribute to the devel-
opment and progression of cancer cachexia (6, 21, 22), we examined
whether rAAV6:Smad7 could prevent muscle wasting in mice bearing
cachexia-inducing Colon-26 (C-26) carcinomas. Body mass, skeletal
muscle mass, and heart and fat mass were all reduced in tumor-
bearing mice, compared with tumor-free mice (fig. S2H). Administering
rAAV6:Smad7 to the TA muscles of tumor-bearing mice preserved
muscle mass, peak isometric tetanic force-producing capacity, and myo-
fiber cross-sectional area relative to healthy control values (Fig. 3A).
Muscles from mice bearing tumors had a reduced proportion of
myofibers that expressed the type IIa myosin heavy chain (MHCIIa)
isoform compared with tumor-free controls (Fig. 3, B and C). Ad-
ministration of rAAV6:Smad7 to the muscles of mice at the time of
tumor implantation prevented the shift in myofiber-type proportions
(Fig. 3, B and C).

 Differences in myofiber size between muscles were consistent with
the proportional differences in muscle mass. No difference was observed
in the frequency of TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling)–positive nuclei
(as a marker of apoptosis) in muscles receiving rAAV6:Smad7 or control
vector in tumor-free or tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 3D), indicating that the
tumor-mediated loss of muscle mass was due to myofiber atrophy, which
was prevented by rAAV6:Smad7 administration. Because administering
therapies for cachexia before muscle wasting develops may not always be
possible, we examinedwhetherinjecting muscleswithrAAV6:Smad7 at 7
or 14 days after tumor establishment was also protective. Delayed
rAAV6:Smad7 still significantly ameliorated TA muscle atrophy, even as
tumors increased in volume by two orders of magnitude (Fig. 3, E and F).
Because cancer cachexia causes wasting of muscles throughout the
body, we next tested whether rAAV6:Smad7 could prevent muscle atro-
phy at a systemic level. Intravenous injection of rAAV6:Smad7 robustly

 increased SMAD7 expression throughout the striated musculature of
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4A and fig. S3A). Systemic rAAV6:Smad7 ad-
ministration also preserved the mass of skeletal muscles in these mice,
without affecting tumor mass, to the extent that the mass of specific
muscles in treated tumor-bearing mice did not differ from that of un-
treated tumor-free mice (Fig.4, B to D, and fig. S3, Band C). The relative
change in muscle mass of healthy versus tumor-bearing mice systemi-
cally administered rAAV6:Smad7 appeared greaterin the former group,
although this was likely due to the up-regulation of catabolic processes
in tumor-bearing mice before the expression of Smad7 reaching thera-
peutic levels. Systemic rAAV6:Smad7 also prevented cardiac atrophy
in tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 4, E and F) and did not elicit increases in
atrial mass or gross lung weight as typically associated with heart failure
(Fig. 4F) (23).

 Despite the protection of muscles from atrophy in tumor-bearing
mice that had received rAAV6:Smad7, the animals had reduced body
mass compared with untreated tumor-free mice (fig. S3D). We hypothe-
sized that the discrepancy between prevention of muscle atrophy and
incomplete conservation of body mass was attributed to cachectic
effects on other tissues (3), which still presented evidence of reduced
mass in treated tumor-bearing mice (fig. S3D). This observation was
supported by the finding that systemic rAAV6:Smad7 did not increase
SMAD7 expression in the nonmuscle tissues of healthy mice (fig.
S1B). Moreover, systemic rAAV6:Smad7 administration did not alter
the expression of SMAD2/3 gene targets (PAI1, COL1A1, CTGF, and
FN1) in a range of nonmuscle tissues (lung, liver, spleen, and kidney)
examined from healthy or C-26 tumor–bearing mice (fig. S4A).
Clinical studies have shown that antagonizing ActRIIB signaling
using systemic ligand traps can produce pathological remodeling of vas-
cular endothelium, which shares some similarities with the vascular
changes associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
(7, 9). We therefore assessed blood vessel integrity in the musculature
and organs of healthy mice and C-26 tumor–bearing mice administered
rAAV6:Smad7 or control vector. No evidence of HHT-like pathology
was observed by histologicalanalysisorgross morphologicalassessment
of muscles and tissues from mice receiving rAAV6:Smad7 (fig. S4B).

 To confirm that the therapeutic effects of rAAV6:Smad7 in the
setting of cachexia were not unique to the model used, we tested the
efficacy of our rAAV6:Smad7 intervention in inhibin-a knockout mice
(Inha−/−), which exhibit profound cachexia subsequent to the develop-
ment of gonadal tumors (Fig. 5, A and B) (6, 22, 24). Consistent with
results obtained from mice bearing C-26 tumors, intramuscular admin-
istration of rAAV6:Smad7 to the muscles of Inha−/− mice (Fig. 5C) pre-
vented muscle atrophy (Fig. 5, D to F), thus demonstrating that rAAV6:
Smad7 can prevent cachexia independent of tumor origin.
Smad7 gene delivery prevents transcription of ubiquitin
ligases involved in skeletal muscle proteolysis
In the cachectic mouse models, SMAD7 protected striated musculature
from wasting despite circulating levels of activins A and B remaining
elevated (Fig. 6A). Application of serum from C-26 tumor–bearing mice
to cultures of mouse myogenic C2C12 cells stimulated Smad3 signaling
(Fig. 6B). We attribute the protective effects of rAAV6:Smad7 in cachec-
tic mice to the suppression of SMAD3 phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and
D), and also reduced expression of Smad3 (Fig. 6E), that would di-
minish SMAD3-mediated effects on target gene transcription in striated
musculature.
However, because tumor- and host-derived interleukin-6 (IL-6) is
also implicated in the etiology of cachexia (3, 25), we examined whether
the protective effects of Smad7 were associated with altered IL-6 signal-
ing. Administration of rAAV6:Smad7 did not alter circulating levels of
IL-6 (Fig. 6F) or the phosphorylation of interleukin-responsive STAT3
(signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) in the muscles of
tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 6G), nor did treatment affect phosphorylation

 of p65, a key regulator of nuclear factor kB signaling engaged by pro-
cachectic cytokines (Fig. 6H). Administration of rAAV6:Smad7 to
muscles did not alter phosphorylation of FOXO1 or FOXO3, which
are transcriptional regulators of the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases
MurRF1 and MAFbx (Fig. 6I). However, in the muscles of tumor-
bearing mice, treatment reduced FOXO1/3 abundance (Fig. 6J) and
transcription (Fig. 6K) and suppressed MuRF1 and MAFbx expression
(Fig. 6L).
DISCUSSION
Muscle wasting is a leading predictor of poor prognosis in cancer pa-
tients (2). Here, we demonstrate that attenuating ActRIIB intramuscular
signaling with an AAV-based gene therapeutic is an effective means to
prevent muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia. Smad7 gene
therapy improved muscle mass in three
established mouse models of cachexia, in-
cluding instances of treatment commenc-
ing after implantation of tumors, and
did not affect other organs, suggesting
high specificity and low toxicity. Because
other AAV-based “gene therapies” have
proven safe and functional in clinical
trials for neuromuscular disorders and
nonmuscle-related diseases (13, 26), the
strategy proposed herein, although only
tested in mice, may have potential to help
reduce cancer-related morbidity and
mortality.
Alternative approaches to modulating
ActRIIB signaling in muscle have targeted
the circulating factors that bind and acti-
vate ActRIIB, which include myostatin,
activin and GDF11 (3, 6, 27, 28), because
these factors can induce striated muscle
atrophy and are often associated with
muscle wasting in various disease states
(3–5, 21, 22, 29–33). However, the feasi-
bility of such ligand traps and ActRIIB re-
ceptor antagonists remains in question
because of the potential for serious off-
target effectscausedbyinhibitingpleiotrop-
ic actions of the multiple ligands involved
(7–9). Moreover, strategies that target on-
ly one ActRIIB ligand, such as myostatin
(and not activins) (27), may be of limited
use owing to the redundant actions of
other ActRIIB ligands that also circulate
at increased levels with cancer (20).
Overexpressing Smad7, an endogenous
inhibitor of ActRIIB and SMAD2/3 signal-
ing (11, 34), specifically in striated muscle
avoidsthe off-targeteffectsof ligand traps,
enhances muscle mass and function, and
prevents cancer cachexia in mice. rAAV6:
Smad7 markedly increased Smad7 expres-
sion only in striated muscle and prevented
muscle atrophy when challenged by experimental overexpression of the
ActRIIB ligands myostatin or activin A. The amelioration of systemic
muscle wasting was independent of tumor burden and occurred despite
elevated circulating levels of procachectic ligands. Thus, these results
demonstrate the utility of our approach for dissociating such ligands
from their effects on intracellular signaling processes that promote
muscle wasting.
The results reported here are comparable to those reported by
others testing the efficacy of soluble ActRIIB ligand traps in cachectic
mice (6), although our approach, which targets intracellular signaling
specifically in striated muscle, is conceivably safer. Soluble ActRIIB lig-
and traps sequester not only ligands that cause muscle wasting but
also other TGFb superfamily members with different functions in
nonmuscle tissues (7, 9). The most notable side effects of such ligand
traps are bleeding from mucous membranes and other symptoms as-
sociated with HHT. HHT results from mutations in either of two

 transmembrane receptors, endoglin or activin-like kinase-1, which ul-
timately impair TGFb signaling in endothelial cells, compromising mi-
crovasculature and inducing hemorrhage (35). Such off-target effects
were reported in clinical trials of an ActRIIB ligand trap (36) and are
evident in mouse models of HHT. No signs of adverse microvascular
remodeling or hemorrhage were observed in our mice administered
rAAV6:Smad7, nor was increased Smad7 expression or markers of
SMAD7 bioactivity evident in nonmuscle tissues. The combined spec-
ificity of muscle-directed Smad7 gene delivery and lack of side effects
suggest that rAAV6:Smad7 is an efficacious and more specific
alternative to ActRIIB ligand traps.
Mechanistically, excessive ActRIIB signaling promotes muscle ca-
tabolism by repressing muscle protein synthesis and promoting its
degradation (10, 37). Our studies demonstrate that overexpressing
Smad7 increases S6K/S6RP signaling, but not Akt and mTOR activa-
tion, which are key regulators of protein synthesis. Others have similarly
demonstrated upstreamregulation of S6RP independent of mTOR (38).
Overexpressing Smad7 in cachectic muscles also reduced transcription
of the E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFbx (Atrogin-1), which fa-
cilitate protein degradation in skeletal muscle. These combined effects
on both anabolic and catabolic signaling required suppression of
SMAD2/3 phosphorylation as did the attenuation of myostatin and ac-
tivin A overexpression. Thus, increased SMAD7 expression represents a
potent method to inhibit excessive ActRIIB signaling and the resulting
increase in SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and muscle catabolism, by shift-
ing the balance from protein degradation in favor of protein synthesis.
Similar to studies where cachectic mice received soluble ActRIIB
(6), fat mass was not preserved in tumor-bearing mice treated system-
ically with rAAV6:Smad7. These results are not surprising, because the
muscle-targeted approach of rAAV6:Smad7 would not be expected to
directly influence adipose physiology. Ameliorating lipolysis in cachexia
may be more effectively achieved by jointly targeting other cachexia-
associated cytokines, such as IL-6 and TWEAK (25, 39), although con-
serving lean mass and muscle function is arguably the primary goal for
interventions aimed at prolonging survival (2, 6, 40). Of particular note,
the systemic administration of rAAV6:Smad7 also prevented cardiac
atrophy in tumor-bearing mice, because rAAV6 vectors administered
via the circulation can transduce cardiac muscle. Increased expression
of myostatin and activin A is associated with heart disease (30, 41, 42),
whereas conversely, physiological cardiac hypertrophy, enhanced cardiac
contractility, and protection from cardiac atrophy occur in myostatin-
null mice and cardiac muscle (42–45). Therefore, the administration
of rAAV6:Smad7 to the heart could help prevent cardiac cachexia
and preserve cardiac performance in cancer patients.
Because ActRIIB is expressed in many nonmuscle tissues and sev-
eral TGFb superfamily ligands engage this receptor to exert diverse
tissue-specific actions, ligand-trapping approaches pose significant risk
for causing off-target effects (9, 46). By contrast, the data presented
herein introduce rAAV6:Smad7 as a novel approach for preferentially
attenuating ActRIIB signaling in striated muscle (12, 15) with little risk
of producing the off-target effects. Further development of this approach
could include cis elements (promoters, silencers, and microRNA-binding
sites) capable of restricting SMAD7 production to striated muscle, be-
cause this could enhance the long-term applicability and potential
safety. Clinical effectiveness will be contingent upon widespread trans-
duction of striated musculature in adult humans. Although others
have demonstrated the feasibility of administering AAV vectors sys-
temically and regionally (for example, to limb muscles) via vascular
infusion in large animal models, ongoing refinement of vector de-
signs and administration protocols will support the clinical transla-
tion of these therapeutic strategies. Advancing this concept toward
clinical trials will also require studies to establish a minimum effective
dose and complete toxicological profiling in nonhuman primate
models (9).
In terms of limitations, this study only examined the effects of
rAAV6:Smad7 in mouse models. Although these models have been
used previously (6), evaluating efficacy in other even more clinically
relevant models remains a challenge not only for this study but also
for the development of prospective cachexia therapeutics in general
(47). Because of ethical considerations, our study did not test whether
rAAV6:Smad7 was sufficient to extend survival. Also, the intervention
did not prevent the loss of fat mass. However, preservation of muscle
mass without protection of fat mass in tumor-bearing mice via admin-
istration of ActRIIB ligand traps has been reported to increase survival
(6), which supports the importance, and prospects, of interventions
that preserve muscle mass and strength.
Beyond cancer cachexia, muscle wasting occurs with many disease
states, including chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease, and heart failure, and is also the defining feature of
age-related sarcopenia. Circulating levels of myostatin and/or activin
are often elevated under these conditions. Attenuating ActRIIB sig-
naling in striated muscle with rAAV6:Smad7 may therefore prove use-
ful in treating many conditions in addition to cancer cachexia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The aim of this study was to investigate whether a genetic intervention
targeting ActRIIB signaling within striated muscle could prevent
muscle wasting associated with cancer cachexia. We evaluated Smad7
gene delivery to musculature, because SMAD7 prevents SMAD2/3
signaling subsequent to ActRIIB activation. A recombinant AAV-based
vector comprising the serotype-6 capsid and a Smad7 expression
cassette was administered to mice via intramuscular or intravenous
delivery. This vector configuration was chosen on the basis of the ca-
pacity of rAAV6 vectors to achieve sustained transduction of mam-
malian (rodent, canine, and nonhuman primate) striated muscle via
local and systemic administration. rAAV6 vectors carrying a geneless
construct were used as controls in all experiments. This intervention
was evaluated in established models of muscle wasting and cancer ca-
chexia, including mice implanted with C-26 carcinoma tumors and
mice that develop tumors and cachexia due to inhibin knockout
(Inha−/−) (6, 24, 39, 48, 49). Primary outcomes of muscle mass and
force-producing capacity were assessed as clinically relevant markers
of cachexia. These data were supported by secondary measures of
muscle fiber morphology and ex vivo protein synthesis, as well as assays
for protein signaling and gene expression to examine underlying mech-
anisms of action (Supplementary Materials and Methods). Time points
of analyses were preselected on the basis of the onset and progression of
cachexia in the different models and are presented in relation to specific
observations reported. Ethical considerations regarding tumor burden
also limited the duration of study and treatment for mice developing or
receiving tumors. Data are presented inclusive of outliers. Age-matched
mice were randomly assigned to experimental cohorts. Samples were
deidentified for biochemical, histological, and functional analyses.

 Biological replicates for cohorts are indicated by n values in the figure
legends. All experiments with mice and viral vectors were conducted in
accordance with the relevant codes of practice for the care and use of
animals for scientific purposes set by the U.S. National Institutes of
Health and the National Health and Medical Council of Australia.
Cachexia animal models
Implantation of C-26–derived tumor tissue was carried out using
CD2F1 or BALB/c mice. Cells or tissue was implanted into the flank
as described previously (48, 49). Briefly, cells were passaged before im-
plantation and reconstituted in 10% Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s me-
dium, whereas tumor pieces were thawed from liquid nitrogen. Cells
were injected subcutaneously, or 1-mm3 tumor pieces were implanted
using a trocar needle through a small incision in the skin overlying the
flank. The mice were analyzed within 28 days of tumor implantation.
Fat, lean, and total body masses of inhibin-a–null mice were analyzed
using quantitative magnetic resonance (Echo Medical Systems).
Gene delivery in vivo
For local vector delivery, mice were anesthetized deeply with isoflurane
or a mixture of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg; intra-
peritoneal injection) (VM Supplies). Individual vectors were ad-
ministered at doses of 1 to 10 × 109 vector genomes (vg, defined by
optimization pilot studies) in 30 ml of Hanks’ balanced salt solution
(HBSS) directly into the anterior compartment of the hindlimb, which
is occupied by the TA and extensor digitorum longus muscles. Control
injections of the contralateral limb used a vector lacking a functional
gene (rAAV6:MCS) (16).
For systemic delivery studies, 3 × 1012 to 5 × 1012 vg of rAAV6:
Smad7 or control vector were administered in HBSS to a total volume
of 200 ml via the tail vein. For rapamycin experiments, mice received
rapamycin (2 mg/kg per day) (Calbiochem, Merck Millipore) or vehi-
cle as a daily intraperitoneal injection commencing 3 hours before
rAAV6:Smad7 injection and continuing for 14 days inclusive. Rapa-
mycin was dissolved overnight in a solution containing 0.2% carbox-
ymethylcellulose sodium salt (Sigma) and 0.25% polysorbate 80
(Sigma) in water, as described previously (50). For tissue harvest, mice
were humanely sacrificed via a cervical dislocation, and the muscles
were rapidly excised and weighed before subsequent processing.
Western blotting
TA muscles were homogenized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay–
based lysis buffer (Merck Millipore) with EDTA-free protease and
phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (cOmplete, Roche). Lysis was followed
by centrifugation at 13,000g for 10 min at 4°C, and samples were dena-
tured for 5 min at 95°C. Protein concentration was determined using a
protein assay kit (Pierce, Thermo Scientific). Protein fractions were sub-
sequently separated by SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using
precast 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gels (Life Technologies), blotted onto nitro-
cellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and incubated with the appropriate an-
tibody overnight. All antibodies used were obtained from Cell Signaling,
except for antibodies against SMAD7 (Imgenex), phosphorylated
SMAD3 (Epitomics), and glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Quantifications of labeled Western blots
were performed using ImageJ pixel analysis (National Institutes of
Health), and data were normalized to a control. Densitometric analyses
of Western blots are presented as band density normalized to the loading
control and are representative of at least three independent samples.
Assessment of muscle function
As described previously (16, 51), the contractile properties of the TA
muscles of mice were assessed in situ by delivering a series of electrical
stimuli to the tibial motor nerve via percutaneous electrodes and re-
cording tension generated during contraction via a force transducer
attached to the distal tendon with surgical silk suture. Mice were an-
esthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (Nembutal; 60 mg/kg; Sigma-
Aldrich) via intraperitoneal injection before testing and were humanely
sacrificed via cardiac excision at the conclusion of evaluation while
still anesthetized deeply. At the conclusion of the protocol, muscles
were rapidly excised, dissected free of tendon and connective tissue,
and weighed.
Statistical analysis
Sample sizes were initially estimated on the basis of analyzing differ-
ences in morphology (that is, muscle mass and muscle fiber size), pre-
vious in-house characterization of the C-26 and rAAV6:Mstn and
rAAV6:Act A models, and published characterizations of Inha−/−
mice. Statistical differences were assessed across multiple conditions
using one-way or two-way ANOVA tests, with the Student-Newman-
Keuls post hoc test used for comparisons between the group means.
Comparisons between two conditions used the two-tailed Student’s
t test. Differences between groups were reported as statistically signif-
icant for values of P < 0.05.
