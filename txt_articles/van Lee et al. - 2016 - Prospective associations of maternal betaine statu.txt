ABSTRACT
Background: Betaine supplementation results in lower body weight
and fat mass and higher lean mass in animals and adult humans.
However, the relation between maternal betaine status and off-
spring birth weight and body composition is less known.
Objective: The aim was to examine the association between ma-
ternal betaine status and neonatal birth size and adiposity in an
Asian mother-offspring cohort.
Design: We included 955 pregnant women whose plasma beta-
ine concentrations were measured at 26–28 wk of gestation.
Neonatal anthropometric values were measured at birth, and
abdominal adipose tissue compartments were assessed by MRI
in a subset of infants (n = 307) in the first 14 d after birth.
Multivariate general linear models were used to adjust for gesta-
tional age; fetal sex; and maternal age, height, education, ethnicity,
prepregnancy body mass index, and plasma folate, vitamin B-12,
and choline concentrations.
Results: The mean 6 SD plasma concentration of betaine was
13.2 6 2.7 mmol/L (range: 5.3–25.0 mmol/L). After adjustment
for covariates, higher maternal plasma betaine was associated
with lower birth weight (b: 257.6 g; 95% CI: 2109.9, 25.3 g),
shorter birth length (b: 20.29 cm per 5-mmol/L increment; 95%
CI: 20.55, 20.03 cm), smaller head circumference (20.20 cm;
95% CI: 20.38, 20.02 cm), smaller midupper arm circumfer-
ence (20.16 cm; 95% CI: 20.30, 20.03 cm), lower volumes of
abdominal superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (24.53 mL;
95% CI: 28.70, 20.36 mL), and a higher risk of small-for-gestational-
age birth (OR: 1.57; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.35).
Conclusions: Higher maternal betaine status was generally associ-
ated with smaller infant birth size and less abdominal fat mass.
Further studies are needed to replicate these findings and to un-
derstand their biological mechanisms. This study was regis-
tered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01174875.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity and body fat distribution are well-known risk factors
for subsequent morbidity and mortality (1, 2), and the escalating
worldwide prevalence of obesity makes it an important target for
prevention (3). Emerging evidence shows that early-life expo-
sures, such as maternal nutrition during pregnancy, may alter the
risk of childhood and adult obesity (4, 5). Although most studies
of maternal nutritional effects have focused on prepregnancy
BMI, gestational weight gain, and macronutrient intakes, current
evidence suggests a possible role for micronutrients as well.
One micronutrient that has been less well studied in the
maternal nutrition literature is betaine. Betaine is an important
methyl donor in the transformation of homocysteine to methi-
onine, through which it is related to the alternative methyl-donor
folate and cofactor vitamin B-12 (Figure 1) (6). An adequate
supply of betaine would provide an advantageous environment
for the programming of the epigenome by meeting the increased
need for methyl groups in rapidly dividing cells (7, 8) and may

 thus be important for fetal development. It has been shown that
maternal betaine status is strongly correlated with cord blood
betaine concentrations (9). Betaine is contained in wheat-rich
food products (10) and can be synthesized by oxidizing the
essential nutrient choline. However, optimal dietary intakes or
plasma concentrations for betaine are yet to be established.
In livestock, betaine is widely supplemented to improve
carcass features, such as a reduction in fat mass and an increase in
lean meat (11). In human trials, the effect of betaine supple-
mentation is less consistent. A double-blind, randomized, con-
trolled 6-wk trial in 23 recreationally trained men reported
a significantly lower total body fat percentage and greater lean
body mass with betaine supplementation (12), whereas no effects
of betaine supplementation on body weight or fat mass were seen
in 42 obese men and women (13) or in 34 untrained men (14). In
cross-sectional observational studies, plasma betaine has been
associated with lower body weight, BMI, total body fat mass, and
waist circumference in Chinese (15) and Norwegian (16) adults.
Higher plasma betaine concentrations were also associated with
lower BMI in 531 patients with acute coronary syndrome (17).
We are aware of only 2 studies that have examined the relation
between maternal plasma betaine concentrations and offspring
birth weight; neither of these showed significant associations (18,
19). No body-composition measures were included in these
studies.
Therefore, although the relation between betaine supple-
mentation and body composition showed promising results in
animals and human adults, the link between maternal plasma
betaine on body composition at birth is largely unexplored. In this
study, we examined the association of maternal betaine status
during pregnancy with neonatal birth size and body composition
in a prospective Asian mother-offspring cohort.
METHODS
Study design
We used data from the GUSTO15 (Growing Up in Singapore
Towards healthy Outcomes) cohort study (www.clinicaltrials.gov,
NCT01174875). GUSTO is a mother-offspring cohort aimed at
evaluating the role of early-life exposures on later-life health
risks. Detailed information on study design and measurements
has been published (20). Briefly, pregnant Chinese, Malay, and
Indian women were recruited at ,14 wk of gestation at the 2
major public maternity units of Kandang Kerbau Women’s and
Children’s Hospital and the National University Hospital in
Singapore from June 2009 to September 2010. Inclusion criteria
included the following: age range between 18 and 50 y; in-
tention to live in Singapore for the following 5 y and to deliver
in 1 of the 2 study maternity units; willingness to donate cord,
cord blood, and placenta; and homogeneous ethnicity of the
participants’ and spouse’s parents. The major exclusion criterion
was having a serious prepregnancy health condition such as type
1 diabetes. The study protocol was approved by the National
Health Care Group Domain-Specific Review Board and Sing
Health Centralized Institutional Review Board, and all partici-
pants gave written informed consent before recruitment.
Blood concentration measurements
Participants underwent a venipuncture in a fasting state at
26–28 wk of gestation during a clinic visit. The blood samples
were processed within 4 h and stored at 2808C before anal-
ysis. Plasma concentrations of betaine, choline, methionine,
and homocysteine were analyzed by using HPLC (1100 series;
Agilent Technologies) and mass spectrometry (API 3000; AB
Sciex) as described by Midttun et al. (21). The within- and
between-day imprecision CVs for these metabolites ranged be-
tween 1% and 10% (21). Plasma vitamin B-12 and folate concen-
trations were assessed by competitive electrochemiluminescence
immunoassay (ADVIA Centaur Immunoassay System; Siemens).
Between-assay CVs were 4–9% for vitamin B-12 and 6–12% for
folate concentrations.
Neonatal anthropometric and body-composition measures
Birth weight and length were obtained from the hospital
delivery records and were measured by midwives within 72 h
after delivery. A calibrated scale (SECA model 334; SECA
Corporation) was used to measure weight to the nearest gram
and a mobile measuring mat (SECA model 210) was used to
measure birth length to the nearest 5 mm. Triceps and sub-
scapular skinfold thicknesses were measured with Holtain
calipers (Holtain Ltd.) to the nearest 0.2 mm. Head, abdominal,
and midupper arm circumferences were measured with a non-
flexible tape to the nearest 0.1 cm. We calculated neonatal total
fat mass as follows: 20.022 + (0.307 3 weight) 2 (0.077 3
sex) + (0.028 3 subscapular skinfold thickness) 2 [0.019 3
gestational age (GA)], where sex = 1 for boys and 0 for girls (22).
Thereafter, fat mass was divided by birth weight and multiplied
by 100% to obtain neonatal total body fat percentage. Small-for-
gestational-age (SGA) was defined as age- and sex-specific birth
weight below the 10th percentile of a global referent population (23).
A subsample of 307 newborns underwent MRI (1.5 Tesla MRI
scanner; GE Health Care) within 14 d after birth to assess

 segmented abdominal adipose tissue compartment volumes (mL),
from the diaphragm to the superior aspect of the sacrum (24).
Superficial subcutaneous (sSAT) and internal abdominal adi-
pose tissue were automatically segmented by in-house seg-
mentation algorithm with the use of Matlab software version
7.13 (Mathworks) and followed by manual optimization. Deep
subcutaneous adipose tissue, which is separated from sSAT by
a fascial plane, was manually defined. The abdominal adipose
tissue volume for each compartment was derived from the sum
of the volumes in each slice from the level of diaphragm to the
superior aspect of the sacrum.
Covariates
Information on infant characteristics (i.e., sex, date of delivery,
and birth order) was retrieved from the hospital delivery records.
GA was determined by a dating ultrasound scan in the first
trimester. During the study clinic visit at 26–28 wk of gesta-
tion, information on maternal ethnicity, age, educational level,
smoking habits, alcohol use, and self-reported pre-pregnancy
weight was collected and an oral-glucose-tolerance test was
administered. Diagnosis of gestational diabetes was based on
WHO criteria (25). Prepregnancy BMI was calculated as self-
reported prepregnancy weight divided by measured height
squared (kg/m2).
Statistical analyses
In total, 1247 participants were recruited for the GUSTO
study, of whom 55 dropped out mainly for personal reasons, 15
were lost to follow-up, and 95 underwent in vitro fertilization or
were having twins and were therefore excluded (Supplemental
Figure 1). We further excluded early preterm newborns (ges-
tational age #34 wk; n = 15) and participants who did not have
measured plasma betaine (n = 112) or birth outcomes (n = 3),
resulting in a total sample of 955 participants for analysis of
neonatal anthropometric outcomes and 307 for analysis of
abdominal adipose tissue.
We used multivariate general linear models to examine as-
sociations with neonatal anthropometric measures and ab-
dominal adipose tissue. We present 3 models: model 1 was the
crude model; model 2 was adjusted for GA (weeks), infant sex,
maternal height (in meters), maternal age (in years), maternal
prepregnancy BMI, ethnicity (Chinese, Malay, or Indian), and
maternal educational level (low, intermediate, or high); and
model 3 was additionally adjusted for maternal plasma choline
(expressed as mmol/L), folate (expressed as nmol/L), and vitamin
B-12 (expressed as pg/mL) concentrations, because choline,
folate, and vitamin B-12 status has been shown to influence
betaine concentrations (13, 26, 27) and birth outcomes (18, 28).
To improve precision, we additionally adjusted for the infant’s
exact postnatal age at MRI measurement for analysis of neonatal
abdominal fat.
In sensitivity analyses, we further studied the potential
confounding effect of plasma homocysteine and plasma me-
thionine and also restricted analyses to folate-sufficient par-
ticipants (.6.8 nmol/L), vitamin B-12–sufficient participants
(.148 pg/mL), and full-term infants (GA .37 wk). Ethnicity
was analyzed as a potential effect modifier by including interac-
tion terms between ethnicity and plasma markers. Last, we used
marginal structural models (29) to explore the potential causal
intermediates of fasting glucose and 2-h postprandial glucose by
estimating the controlled direct effects of betaine on infant size
and adiposity (30, 31).
Missing values for maternal height (n = 9), prepregnancy
BMI (n = 74), educational level (n = 16), fasting glucose (n =
59), and 2-h postprandial glucose (n = 59) were imputed 100
times by using multiple imputation analyses (32). The results
of the 100 data sets were pooled. The marginal structural models
were analyzed by using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute), and all
other analyses were performed by using SPSS software version
23.0 (IBM).
RESULTS
In 955 mothers, the mean 6 SD maternal betaine concentration
was 13.2 6 2.7 mmol/L, with a range from 5.3 to 25.0 mmol/L.
Mothers with higher plasma betaine concentrations, compared
with those with lower concentrations, were less likely to be of
Chinese or Malay ethnicity and more likely to be of Indian eth-
nicity, have no other children, and have higher plasma folate,
vitamin B-12, and choline concentrations but lower homocysteine
concentrations (Table 1).
Birth anthropometric measures
Higher maternal plasma betaine was associated with a trend
toward lower birth weight (b: 244.0 g per 5-mmol/L increment;
95% CI: 293.9, 5.8 g) in the crude model (Table 2). After ad-
justment for all covariates, the inverse association strengthened and
became significant (model 3—b: 257.6 g per 5-mmol/L incre-
ment; 95% CI: 2109.9, 25.3 g). Higher maternal betaine was also
associated with significantly shorter birth length (b: 20.35 cm per
5-mmol/L increment; 95% CI: 20.60, 20.10 cm) in the crude
model and in adjusted models. Significant inverse associations
were also observed between betaine and head circumference
(b: 20.20 cm per 5-mmol/L increment; 95% CI: 20.38, 20.02 cm)
and midupper arm circumference (b: 20.16 cm per 5-mmol/L in-
crement; 95% CI: 20.30, 20.03 cm) in fully adjusted models. An
inverse trend was observed between maternal betaine status and
calculated percentage of total body fat (b: 20.50% per 5-mmol/L
increment; 95% CI: 21.02%, 0.03%) in fully adjusted models,
whereas no associations were observed for abdominal circumfer-
ence, triceps, or subscapular skinfold thickness. Finally, maternal
betaine (per 5-mmol/L increment) status was also associated with
a higher risk of SGA birth in fully adjusted models (OR: 1.57; 95%
CI: 1.05, 2.35).
Abdominal adipose tissue compartment volumes
In the subset of 307 infants who underwent MRI, higher
maternal plasma betaine status was associated with significantly
lower sSAT volume (b: 24.53 mL per 5-mmol/L increment;
95% CI: 28.70, 20.36 mL) in the unadjusted model (Table 3).
This inverse association persisted after adjustment for co-
variates. Plasma betaine concentrations were also associated
with significantly lower volumes of deep subcutaneous adipose
tissue (model 3—b: 21.16 mL per 5-mmol/L increment; 95%
CI: 22.30, 20.02 mL) but not with internal abdominal adipose
tissue (model 2—b: 20.82 mL per 5-mmol/L increment; 95%
CI: 22.31, 0.67 mL).

 Sensitivity analyses
No significant interactions were observed between plasma
betaine concentrations and ethnicity when examining asso-
ciations with anthropometric measurements or abdominal
adipose tissue (all P-interactions . 0.20). Additional ad-
justment for homocysteine and methionine or excluding those
deficient in folate (n = 25) or vitamin B-12 (n = 158) or
preterm infants (n = 22) did not materially alter our results
(data not shown). The controlled direct effect of maternal
betaine (i.e., the effect not mediated by maternal fasting or
postprandial glucose) was similar to the total effects (Sup-
plemental Tables 1 and 2).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to observe that
higher maternal betaine status is associated with smaller birth size
and reduced neonatal abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. These
effects were found to be independent of other methylation-related
covariates, such as folate and vitamin B-12, that could potentially
influence neonatal birth size (28). We observed a modest 44-g
decrease in birth weight per 5-mmol/L increment of betaine, an
effect size comparable to associations of other maternal macro- and
micronutrient status with birth weight (33, 34), although some
micronutrient supplementation studies in pregnant women reported
large mean differences in birth weight (100–200 g) (4).

 Comparisons with previous studies
Mean betaine concentrations in the present study sample were
comparable to those previously reported in human studies, which
varied between 10.0 and 13.1 mmol/L during pregnancy (18, 19,
26, 27). Probably due to a higher requirement of plasma betaine
as a methyl donor during pregnancy (35), the mean betaine
concentrations in our pregnant women were considerably lower
than mean betaine concentrations previously reported in non-
pregnant women (range: 32.5–45.8 mmol/L) (15–17, 27).
We are aware of only 2 other studies that examined the relation
between maternal betaine and birth weight or SGA but did not
find any (18, 19), perhaps due to the relatively small sample sizes
(n = 98 and n = 366, respectively). Nevertheless, Hogeveen et al.
(18) observed an inverse relation between umbilical cord blood
betaine concentrations and birth weight and the risk of low birth
weight in a sample of 1126 infants.
Consistent with the results of animal and human adult betaine
supplementation trials (11, 36), we observed that higher plasma
betaine concentrations were associated with lower birth weight
and neonatal abdominal fat. The inverse association with sSAT is
consistent with the lower abdominal fat mass observed in pigs
and chicks (11). In human adults, the inverse association between
betaine concentrations and body fat percentage appears to be
more pronounced in the trunk and android areas (15). We ob-
served a nonsignificant inverse trend between betaine and total
body fat percentage, which is consistent with the findings in 2
large cohort studies in adults (15, 16). The lack of significance
in our study might be explained by larger measurement errors in
the fat prediction equation compared with dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry scans.
Potential mechanisms
The biological mechanisms whereby betaine influences birth
weight and body composition remain unclear. Betaine may affect
insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. Persons who suffer
from type 2 diabetes have reduced concentrations of plasma
betaine (37), and betaine supplementation is associated with
improved glucose homeostasis in rats through increasing the
expression of fibroblast growth factor 21 (30, 31). However, we
found that the controlled total and direct effects of maternal
betaine on neonatal outcomes were similar, suggesting that the
effects shown are unlikely due to an indirect effect via maternal
fasting or 2-h postprandial glucose concentrations.
Plasma betaine has also been associated with the stimulation of
plasma growth hormone (11, 36), which, in turn, is associated
with adipocyte lipolysis and reduced extraction, uptake, and
synthesis of free fatty acids and triglycerides. Growth hormone
has been shown to increase the percentage of carcass lean mass
and to reduce fat deposition in pigs (11).
Another potential mechanism might be via the methylation
capacity of betaine. Betaine is important for DNA methylation,
polyamine synthesis, protein synthesis, and cell growth (38). In
addition, acetyl-CoA is necessary for fatty acid synthesis, and its
availability might be reduced by increased methylation of
homocysteine to methionine caused by higher betaine concen-
trations (39). Acetyl-CoA carboxylase has been reported to
decrease during betaine supplementation in pigs (40). Another
methylation product is carnitine, which is necessary for the
transport of long-chain fatty acids to the mitochondria for oxi-
dation. Betaine enhances the synthesis of carnitine (11, 41), and
dietary carnitine has been associated with reduced carcass fat
content in pigs (11).
Strengths and limitations
A key strength of our study is our use of plasma nutrient
markers. Nutrient biomarkers are associated with smaller mea-
surement errors than self-reported dietary assessment tools (42)
and reflect both dietary intake and endogenous synthesis. In
addition, plasma concentrations of other metabolites involved in
the methylation pathway were also available, which enabled us to
include those as covariates in our statistical models. We also had
a comprehensive set of neonatal measurements, including MRI
scans in a substantial subset of newborns. MRI is the only
available method for the quantification of regional adipose tissue
compartment volumes (43). An additional strength of our study is
its longitudinal design, which should protect against reverse
causality.
Several limitations of our study also merit comment. First, it is
important to recognize that maternal plasma betaine concen-
trations do not necessarily reflect the nutrient status of the fetus
during pregnancy. Disturbed placental metabolism, maternal-
placental transfer, or uptake by the fetus may have influenced the
betaine status of the fetus. Nevertheless, it has been reported that
maternal betaine concentration is a good predictor of cord blood
(9). Second, this study was conducted in a Singaporean mother-
offspring cohort and generalization to other populations should

 be made with caution. Finally, despite our efforts to adjust for
multiple covariates, we cannot exclude the possibility of residual
confounding by unmeasured or poorly measured covariates.
Implications and future research
In summary, we observed that higher maternal betaine status
was associated with lower neonatal weight, length, head cir-
cumference, midupper arm circumference, and abdominal sub-
cutaneous fat. Because most prenatal supplements do not contain
a source of choline or betaine, these effects were observed in
plasma concentrations achieved by dietary intake and endoge-
nous synthesis. It has been argued that including a source of
choline in the diets or prenatal supplements of pregnant women
may be warranted (35, 44), but the results of our study suggest
that such supplementation may do more harm than good. Future
research is warranted to confirm our findings and to investigate
underlying biological mechanisms. We plan further follow-up of
our cohort to assess longer-term effects on child growth, health,
and development.
