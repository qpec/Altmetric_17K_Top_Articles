Abstract
Background: The spread of drug-resistant bacterial pathogens poses a major threat to global health. It is widely
recognised that the widespread use of antibiotics has generated selective pressures that have driven the
emergence of resistant strains. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first observed in 1960, less
than one year after the introduction of this second generation beta-lactam antibiotic into clinical practice.
Epidemiological evidence has always suggested that resistance arose around this period, when the mecA gene
encoding methicillin resistance carried on an SCCmec element, was horizontally transferred to an intrinsically
sensitive strain of S. aureus.
Results: Whole genome sequencing a collection of the first MRSA isolates allows us to reconstruct the evolutionary
history of the archetypal MRSA. We apply Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction to infer the time point at which this
early MRSA lineage arose and when SCCmec was acquired. MRSA emerged in the mid-1940s, following the
acquisition of an ancestral type I SCCmec element, some 14 years before the first therapeutic use of methicillin.
Conclusions: Methicillin use was not the original driving factor in the evolution of MRSA as previously thought.
Rather it was the widespread use of first generation beta-lactams such as penicillin in the years prior to the
introduction of methicillin, which selected for S. aureus strains carrying the mecA determinant. Crucially this
highlights how new drugs, introduced to circumvent known resistance mechanisms, can be rendered ineffective by
unrecognised adaptations in the bacterial population due to the historic selective landscape created by the
widespread use of other antibiotics.

Background
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has
been identified as one of the major risk pathogens
associated with the development of antimicrobial resist-
ance (AMR). The emergence of AMR in S. aureus is well
documented and the species has proven particularly
adept at evolving resistance in the face of new antibiotic
challenges. The introduction of penicillin in the 1940s
heralded a revolution in the treatment of infectious
diseases. However, at the same time as its use was
becoming more widespread following advances in the
scaling up of production, evidence of penicillin resist-
ance in S. aureus was already being uncovered [1].
Methicillin (Celbenin), a semi-synthetic β-lactam, was
introduced in the UK in 1959 to circumvent growing
penicillin resistance in S. aureus, associated with the
acquisition of a β-lactamase enzyme, blaZ [2]. As a
second-generation β-lactam antibiotic, methicillin was
insensitive to breakdown by BlaZ. Following the intro-
duction of methicillin into clinical practice in the UK,
the Staphylococcal Reference Laboratory in Colindale
(London,
England)
screened
S.
aureus
isolates
for
evidence of resistance to this antibiotic [3]. More than
5000 S. aureus strains were assessed in the period

 between October 1959 and November 1960, and in Oc-
tober 1960 three isolates showing increased minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to the new drug,
methicillin, were identified. The isolates originated from
the same hospital and shared a common phage type and
resistance profile (penicillin, streptomycin, and tetracyc-
line), suggesting that they were related. In the descrip-
tion of these isolates it was noted that methicillin had
been used only once previously at this hospital, and that
none of the individuals from whom MRSA was isolated
had been exposed to the drug. Within 2 years MRSA
was being detected elsewhere in Europe, with invasive
infections being identified in Denmark [4]. These MRSA
isolates from the UK and Denmark in the early 1960s
constitute the very first epidemic MRSA clone.
The genetic basis of methicillin resistance in S. aureus
is associated with carriage of a mobile cassette of genes
known as the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec
(SCCmec) [5]. Within this cassette is the mecA gene that
is responsible for resistance to β-lactams including
methicillin. The product of mecA is the peptidoglycan
synthesis enzyme penicillin binding protein (PBP) 2a
involved in cross-linking of peptidoglycan in the bacter-
ial cell wall [6, 7]. PBP2a has a lower binding affinity for
β-lactam
antibiotics
than
the
native
PBP
proteins
encoded in the core genome of S. aureus. The subse-
quent combination of reduced penicillin-binding affinity
and increased production of PBP2a accounts for the
observed resistance to β-lactam antibiotics.
Genetic analyses of the first MRSA by multi-locus
sequence typing (MLST) demonstrated that they were
sequence type (ST) 250, a lineage belonging to clonal
complex (CC) 8 and carried the type I SCCmec element
[8, 9]. After emerging in the UK, this first epidemic
MRSA clone (ST250-MRSA-I) spread across Europe
during the 1960s and 70s, but by the late 1980s had be-
come less prevalent and is now rarely reported [9–11].
The single locus variant and close relative of ST250-
MRSA-I, ST247-MRSA-I was first detected in Denmark
in 1964 [8] and has been more successful, spreading
globally and persisting as a source of outbreaks in
Europe into the late 1990s [10, 11], but this too has been
superseded by more successful contemporary clones
[10]. Five decades on since the appearance of the first
MRSA, multiple MRSA lineages have emerged which
have acquired different variants of SCCmec elements.
Epidemiological evidence has always suggested that
MRSA arose as a consequence of the introduction of
methicillin into clinical practice. Here we have used
whole genome sequencing of a collection of 209 of the
earliest MRSA isolates recovered in Europe between
1960 and 1989 to reconstruct the evolutionary history of
methicillin
resistance.
Using
Bayesian
phylogenetic
reconstruction we have identified the likely time point at
which this early lineage arose and also predicted the
time around which SCCmec was acquired.
Results
Early MRSA belong to a diverse clone
Preserved in the culture collection of the Staphylococcal
Reference Laboratory at Public Health England are
representatives of the very first MRSA identified. These
original isolates have been preserved as freeze-dried
cultures, and have not been repeatedly passaged over the
years. One hundred and eighty eight isolates that
represented the earliest MRSA were recovered from the
ampoules and their genomes sequenced (Additional file 1:
Table S1). All the isolates belonged to CC8 MRSA and
were originally isolated between 1960 and the late 1970s,
and included eight isolates from the original study de-
scribing MRSA in 1961 [3]. In addition, 21 CC8 MRSA
isolated between 1964 and 1989 in Denmark [8, 11] were
sequenced, as representatives of the earliest MRSA de-
tected elsewhere in Europe. We also included early
methicillin-sensitive isolates of ST250 or ST247 (n = 11);
however, only a limited number of these were found in
the reference laboratory collection.
Analysis of the MLST of the isolates identified two
main groups, ST250 (n = 126) and a single locus vari-
ant (SLV), ST247 (n = 78), plus two novel SLVs of
ST247 (n = 4) (Additional file 1: Table S1). A supple-
mentary isolate from the Public Health England col-
lection was included to provide an outgroup for the
analysis; RH12000692_7401696 is an MRSA which
was collected in 1967 and is a triple locus variant of
ST250 (Additional file 1: Table S1).
The S. aureus isolate COL, a representative member of
this early MRSA lineage first identified in the 1960s [12],
had previously been fully sequenced, and the chromo-
some was used as a reference for mapping. Following ex-
clusion
of
mobile
genetic
elements
(MGEs)
and
predicted recombination events in the collection, a total
of 4220 SNPs were identified and used to construct a
phylogeny (Fig. 1a). The population framework revealed
a diverse population structure containing several distinct
clades. The mapping of the ST information on to the
phylogeny reveals that the ST250 population is basal to
the ST247, suggesting that ST247 emerged from ST250,
which is consistent with the epidemiological evidence,
and
supports
the
hypothesis
that
this
pandemic
multidrug-resistant MRSA clone emerged out of the
ancestral MRSA genotype [8, 9].
Highlighted in the expanded view (Fig. 1b) are the iso-
lates from the Jevons study, derived from three individ-
uals at the same hospital in the South London area
between July and November 1960 [3]. The isolation
source and resistance profiles of these isolates are shown
in

These
isolates are

 genetically very closely related, differing by seven SNPs
only. Present within this cluster are additional isolates
from the Public Health England collection originating
between 1960 and 1961. Full epidemiological data are
not available for these, but two of these isolates were
identified in the same region as the hospital where the
original Jevons study isolates originated. The genetic
distance
between
isolates
and
their
phylogenetic
relationships suggests there was transmission within the
hospital between patients A and C and nurse B, and that
they were also transmitted beyond the hospital as part of
a local outbreak.
Although all of the Jevons isolates are confined to a
single clade, other isolates from the early 1960s are
distributed throughout the entire phylogeny (Fig. 2).
This suggests that the earliest MRSA circulating in the
UK were not from a single recently emerged clone, but
were representatives of an established population. In
addition
to
the
UK
isolates,
there
were
21
from
Denmark, which represent the earliest MRSA detected
outside the UK. These derive from 1964 onwards, and
include the youngest isolates within the collection from
the late 1980s. The Danish isolates are found in three
clusters distributed throughout the phylogeny (Fig. 1a),
suggesting that, like the early UK MRSA, they originated
from an established and diverse population.
Genetic basis of resistance to methicillin and other
antibiotics in the archetypal MRSA population
Previous studies have shown that the archaic MRSA
clone carried a type I SCCmec element, which was the
first type of this MGE family to be classified [5, 13].
Notably, the description of the type I element was based
upon
the
SCCmec
derived
from

 NCTC10442 identified in the 1960 Jevons study (Fig. 1b;
Additional file 2: Table S2) [13]. The type I element
carries mecA as its only resistance gene in combination
with a truncated gene encoding the MecRI regulatory
proteins (together known as a class B mec gene com-
plex) with type 1 chromosomal recombinases (ccrA1 and
ccrB1). The original description of SCCmec type I identi-
fied the presence of a frameshift mutation in ccrB1
which disrupts the translation of this site-specific recom-
binase [13]; the mutation occurs after codon 321 and is
caused by a single base deletion in a poly-A hexamer
resulting in a pentamer sequence. In the collection, 193
of the isolates contained intact SCCmec elements carry-
ing the mecA gene (Fig. 2). Of these, 192 were SCCmec
type I elements, all of which contained the pentamer
sequence and the same frameshift mutation in ccrB1 as
the NCTC10442 reference. The only non-type I element
identified in the collection was in the outgroup isolate
RH12000692_7401696, which contained a type IVh
SCCmec element. The remaining 16 isolates lacking
complete SCCmec elements were distributed throughout
the
phylogeny,
suggesting
that
these
represent
methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) arising from the
loss of the type I SCCmec element, rather than forming
an ancestral MSSA population.
In addition to methicillin resistance, the first MRSA
described were also resistant to penicillin, streptomycin
and tetracycline [3]. Analysis of the genomes of these
isolates identified blaZ and tetK genes conferring resist-
ance to penicillin and tetracycline, respectively, but failed
to identify the str, aadE or aad9 genes associated with
streptomycin resistance in S. aureus. In the absence of

the COL reference is displayed on the left, and the panels on the right indicate dates of isolation (coloured according to year; see key below for years),
and the presence (purple boxes) and absence (white space) of genetic determinants responsible for antibiotic resistance in the genomes of the isolates.
The identity of genetic determinants are listed at the top and divided into acquired genes (red text; left hand side), and core mutations (green text; right
hand side). The antibiotics linked to the genetic determinants for the acquired genes are: β-lactams, blaZ and mecA; chloramphenicol, catA1, catA2, and
catA3; erythromycin, ermA; clindamycin, linA; aminoglycosides, aacA-aphD, aad9, aadD, aph3A, and str; tetracycline, tetM and tetK; disinfectants, qacA and
qacC. And for the core gene mutations are: streptomycin substitution of arginine for a lysine at residue 56 (K56R) of the ribosomal protein rpsL; fusidic
acid, substitution of a proline for a leucine at residue 406 (P404L) of the transcription elongation factor fusA; trimethoprim, substitution of an tyrosine for
a phenylalanine at residue 99 (F99Y) of the dihydrofolate reductase dfrA. Sixteen isolates lacked complete type I SCCmec elements, 4 of which contained
internal deletions in the SCCmec element but retained the mecA gene

 an acquired resistance gene, the core genome was exam-
ined for mutations potentially responsible for resistance
to streptomycin. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, muta-
tions in the ribosomal protein RpsL were shown to con-
fer streptomycin resistance, including the substitution of
an arginine for a lysine residue at residue 43 [14]. Align-
ment of the M. tuberculosis and S. aureus sequences
revealed that RpsL in the Jevons isolates contained an
arginine in the equivalent position, residue 56. Compari-
son
with
RpsL
sequences
in
the
public
sequence
databases showed that in S. aureus the frequent amino
acid residue at position 56 was lysine. Examining the
whole collection, all but one of the sequenced isolates
contained the arginine residue at position 56, the excep-
tion being the outgroup isolate RH12000692_7401696
(Fig. 2). This demonstrates that the non-synonymous
substitution resulting in an arginine for a lysine residue
at residue 56 (K56R) occurred most likely very early
during emergence of the archetypal MRSA population.
In silico analysis of the resistomes of the isolates
revealed genetic resistance determinants to numerous
other antibiotics, including penicillin (blaZ), erythro-
mycin (ermA and linA), kanamycin (aadD), gentamicin
and
kanamycin
(aacA-aphD),
spectinomycin
and
streptomycin (aad9), and chloramphenicol (catA1, catA2
and catA3), fusidic acid (fusA P404L) and trimethoprim
(dfrA F99Y), as well as genes associated with decreased
susceptibility to disinfectants (qacA and qacC). The fre-
quency and widespread dispersal of these determinants
reveal the strong selective pressure exerted by antibiotics
on the archetypal MRSA clone over an extensive period.
Examining their distribution in the context of the phyl-
ogeny shows that some of these traits have been co-
acquired (Fig. 2), such as ermA and aad9, which are
carried on Tn554, and that these acquisition events can
be mapped on to the phylogeny [15].
Evolution and emergence of methicillin resistance
To determine if the methicillin resistance emerged once
or multiple times in the archetypal MRSA population,
we examined the variation within the SCCmec type I ele-
ments. In total, 194 variant sites were identified in 192
elements present in the collection. Analysis of the distri-
bution of the variation within the elements suggested
that some could be attributed to homologous recombin-
ation.
Two
regions
contained
the
majority
of
the
variation: 124 SNP sites were identified in the gene
encoding the LPxTG surface protein pls, and 31 SNP
sites within a 549-bp intergenic region between a hypo-
thetical protein (SACOL0030) and a glycerophosphoryl
diester
phosphodiesterase
(SACOL0031).
Excluding
these predicted recombination regions, 39 core variants
sites across 28.6 kb distinguished the 192 elements, with
half of the isolates (n = 96) carrying an identical element.
The maximum SNP distance distinguishing any two ele-
ments was eight SNPs, and phylogenetic analysis re-
vealed that the elements present in the historic MRSA
clone were closely related (Additional file 3: Figure S1)
and shared a common evolutionary origin.
Our analysis of the evolutionary events surrounding
the emergence of methicillin resistance in the archetypal
MRSA lineage focused on a subset of 122 isolates that
had precise dates and places of origin which could be
linked to original submission records (Additional file 2:
Table S1). This enabled us to generate a robust Bayesian
phylogeny and temporal calibration. Examining the dis-
tribution of the type I SCCmec variants (Fig. 3a) within
the context of a core genome phylogeny generated with
BEAST (Fig. 3b) revealed congruence between the
phylogenetic relationships of the two. All of the canon-
ical SNPs associated with the SCCmec genotypes could
be singularly mapped onto nodes of the core phylogeny,
suggesting that the variation observed in the SCCmec el-
ements had occurred during expansion of the ST250
and ST247 populations. On the basis of this, we propose
that a type I SCCmec element was acquired once in a
single primordial development of methicillin resistance
(Fig. 3b) that could be dated back to the emergence of
this clone.
In our Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the core gen-
ome SNPs we utilized a range of population and clock
model combinations. The combination of an exponential
population and relaxed-log normal clock model was
found to be the best fit to our data based on Bayes fac-
tors using the harmonic mean estimator. This indicated
the time to most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of
the ST250/ST247 population was 1946 (95% highest
posterior density (HPD) 1938–1952) (Additional file 3:
Figure S2), and therefore the time of acquisition of
SCCmec was likely around, or before, this date. Notably,
the TMRCA of the type I SCCmec elements in these
isolates based on a linear regression of a core SNP
phylogeny was predicted to be early 1941 (Additional file 3:
Figure S3).
To ensure that the Bayesian result was not an artefact
of the clock or population models used in the analysis,
we calculated the TMRCA for a range of model combi-
nations and found that our chosen model exhibited a
predicted TMRCA that was encompassed by the 95%
HPDs of all other model combinations (Fig. 4).
Discussion
This historic collection provides unique insights into of
the evolution of the first MRSA lineage. Preserved for
decades in their original freeze-dried state, this large col-
lection of strains representing the earliest MRSA clone
has allowed us to reconstruct the evolutionary events
leading
to the emergence of MRSA. Using whole
Harkins et al. Genome Biology  (2017) 18:130 
Page 5 of 11
 genome sequencing we have been able to shed light on
the time when SCCmec first entered into S. aureus, and
also to estimate how many times this is likely to have
happened in the archaic MRSA population.
The
origins
of
SCCmec
almost
certainly
lie
in
coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) [16]. S. aureus
belonging to the ST250 background appear to have been
the first recipient in the transfer from CoNS, but
whether the element entered the ST250 population on
multiple occasions, or as a single isolated event with
subsequent propagation through the population, has
never been definitively resolved. A single entry of mecA
followed
by
its
evolution
within
the
recipient
background has been suggested [17]. In order to clarify
this we examined the variation present within the
SCCmec elements in isolates throughout the population.
The variation seen within SCCmec is predominantly in
the pls gene, which has been described before [18].
Functionality of this 230 kDa cell wall-anchored (CWA)
protein remains unclear, but its expression has been
shown to reduce adhesion to host proteins as well as de-
crease invasiveness [19]. This LPxTG surface protein has
a highly repetitive D/S-rich structure, making it a target
for homologous recombination. As noted in other line-
ages the CWA proteins are subject to diversifying
selection and exhibit diversity between and within S.

collection’s isolates (n = 122), which had precise dates of isolation, and whose origins could be linked back to the original submission documentation. The
branches of the tree are coloured according to the genotype of the SCCmec type I element present in that strain (illustrated in a). Internal branches
are coloured according to parsimonious reconstruction of the predicted genotype. Where terminal branches are black and highlighted by a black

phylogenetic reconstruction where an ancestral type I SCCmec element was acquired. The root of the tree corresponds to the basal node of the
ST250/ST247 population in Fig. 1 rooted by the RH12000692_7401696 outgroup. From the analysis the estimated mutation rate of population is
1.8 × 10−6 SNPs/site/year. This substitution rate falls within the reported ranges of multiple successful S. aureus lineages [31] and therefore it is unlikely
likely that long-term storage of the isolates has created any temporal artefacts

 aureus lineages [20, 21]. Removal of this variation re-
veals that the evolutionary history of the SCCmec ele-
ments was congruent with that of the strains carrying
them, which points towards a single acquisition, rather
than multiple or recurrent horizontal transmissions.
Supporting this hypothesis is the observation of a muta-
tion in ccrB1 gene of the SCCmec type I element. The
recombinase genes are required for both integration and
excision from the chromosome. Specifically, CcrB is
required for excision and the mutation present within
this NCTCT10442 type I SCCmec element is believed to
produce a non-functioning recombinase [22, 23]. Given
that all the isolates in this collection have this frameshift
mutation, this strongly supports the conclusions of the
phylogenetic analysis, namely that a type I SCCmec was
acquired once in the ST250 background, and then
became fixed in the population due to defective recom-
binase apparatus that precluded excision.
One of the questions we sought to address in this
study was what were the temporal events surrounding
the emergence of MRSA. With the first reports of
MRSA occurring only after introduction of methicillin in
the UK in 1959 and Denmark in 1964 it seemed reason-
able to conclude that resistance arose after the first
clinical use of the drug, and resistance therefore devel-
oped in S. aureus as an adaptive response following
exposure to the antibiotic. However, the results pre-
sented in this communication are not consistent with
this conclusion, since the gene bestowing methicillin
resistance was likely to have been acquired in the mid-
1940s. It was during this period that β-lactamase-
mediated penicillin resistance was becoming widespread
among clinical isolates of S. aureus. Within 4 years of
the introduction of penicillin for the treatment of
staphylococcal infections, the first penicillin-resistant S.
aureus were being described in 1944 [1]. In the years
that followed the frequency of resistance in clinical iso-
lates climbed steadily, such that by the time methicillin
was introduced into clinical practice in 1960, resistance
rates of 80% were common [24, 25].
Whilst the main genetic determinant associated with
penicillin resistance in S. aureus is blaZ, mecA also
encodes penicillin resistance via a different mechanism
involving
an
alternative
penicillin-binding
protein,
PBP2a [6, 26]. In the sequenced collection blaZ is widely
distributed, albeit at a lower frequency than mecA
(85.2% of isolates carry the blaZ gene in comparison to
95.2% for mecA), suggesting a selective advantage to
possessing two distinct β-lactam resistance mechanisms.
Based on the temporal calibration of the acquisition of
mecA, it appears likely that methicillin resistance in S.
aureus evolved long before this new β-lactam antibiotic
was introduced. Thus, it was the widespread use of peni-
cillin, rather than methicillin, that was the driver for the
emergence in the archaic MRSA clone.
Beyond β-lactams our analysis uncovered evidence for
the strong selective impact that a number of different
antibiotics have had on the evolution of the archaic

 MRSA clone. Several of the antibiotics, such as tetracyc-
line, are prescribed in far lower amounts today in human
medicine than in the 1950s and 1960s, and resistance to
these
antibiotics
in
contemporary
S.
aureus
from
humans is relatively rare, which contrasts with the ar-
chaic MRSA population, in which the distribution of
tetracycline
resistance
determinants
was
widespread
(Fig. 2; 96% of isolates contained tetK or/and tetM) [27].
In a prescient study examining the antibiotic consump-
tion and rates of resistance in a hospital in the US in the
1950s, Bauer et al. provided evidence of a correlation be-
tween the two, where increasing usage of tetracycline
was associated with an increase in the frequency of
tetracycline resistance in isolates from inpatients [25].
In addition to methicillin and tetracycline resistances, a
key phenotypic marker of the archaic MRSA clone was
non-susceptibility to streptomycin. In our analysis we
identified a mutation predicted to confer streptomycin re-
sistance occurring on the same branch of the tree in which
we mapped the acquisition of the SCCmec element. This
finding suggests that methicillin and streptomycin resist-
ance both emerged in the archetypal MRSA progenitor
population around the same time. Discovered in the early
1940s, streptomycin was demonstrated to have activity
against Gram-positive pathogens, and was used in the UK
in 1947 during the first ever randomized clinical trials
studying the efficacy of streptomycin in the treatment of
pulmonary tuberculosis [28, 29]. It therefore appears that
the first MRSA clone emerged, and developed resistance
to two of the earliest antibiotics—streptomycin and peni-
cillin—almost immediately after the S. aureus population
would have been first exposed to them.
At the time of its discovery, the incidence of MRSA in
the general population is likely to have been very low.
This is demonstrated by the fact that screening of over
5000 samples at Public Health England yielded only
three methicillin-resistant isolates. Therefore, it is likely
that when methicillin was introduced to circumvent
penicillin resistance in S. aureus, it did not select for
emergence of MRSA at that time, but instead provided
the selective pressure, which drove the nosocomial
spread of a pre-existing variant, at a time when infection
control measures in UK hospitals were limited.
Conclusions
This study highlights the unintended consequences of
widespread antibiotic use, and how when new drugs are
introduced to bypass known resistance mechanisms,
they may already be rendered ineffective due to unrecog-
nised adaptations accrued in response to prior selective
pressures exerted by other antibiotics. This remains one
of the many challenges in tackling the growing problem
of AMR and serves to emphasise the importance of con-
tinual surveillance of pathogen populations for evidence
of emerging adaptations and resistance patterns in the
context of prescribing practice.
Methods
Bacterial isolates
Two hundred and nine isolates derived from the culture
collections of Staphylococcus aureus reference labora-
tory, Public Health England, and isolates originating
from the Statens Serum Institute collected and analysed
by Profs Tomasz, Westh and de Lencastre. These corres-
pond to a collection of MRSA and MSSA isolates col-
lected between 1960 and the late 1980s in the UK and
Denmark. Isolates from the Public Health England col-
lection were all retrieved from the original freeze-dried
cultures put down in the 1960s. All the Statens Serum
Institute isolates were kept in a lyophilized state until
the late 1990s, when they were opened, sub-cultured,
and then stored at –80 °C. A record of the number of
sub-cultures prior to freeze-drying, or post-isolate recov-
ery, was not available, but it is known that the isolates
were not repeatedly sub-cultured over the last 50 years.
One hundred and eighty eight isolates preserved as
freeze-dried cultures in the Health Protection England
(HPA) Staphylococcal Reference Laboratory were resur-
rected and grown on solid media. Prior to the start of
this study the Reference Laboratory sequence typed all
isolates from 1960 and 1961 using standard MLST
techniques [30] and identified that the isolates belonged
to CC8 and were either ST250 or ST247.
Twenty-one CC8 MRSA isolated in Denmark between
1964 and 1989 were also included in this study. These
isolates originating from the Statens Serum Institute and
had been previously sequence typed using standard
MLST techniques [30]. All isolates in this study were
subsequently sequence typed from their whole genome
sequence data (see below).
Genomic library preparation and sequencing
Genomic DNA was isolated using the Qiagen QIAcube
system according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
We prepared sequencing libraries from 500 ng of
DNA extracted from each MRSA isolate as previously
described, with amplification using Kapa Hifi polymerase
(Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, MA, USA) [31]. Tagged
DNA libraries were created using a method adapted
from a standard Illumina Indexing protocol, as described
previously
[31].
Whole
genome
sequencing
was
performed on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform with
100-bp paired-end reads. The Illumina sequence data
have
been
submitted
to
the
European
Nucleotide
Archive (ENA) and the accession numbers are provided
in Additional file 1: Table S1.

 Bioinformatic and phylogenetic analysis
The sequence reads for each representative isolate (n = 209)
were aligned against the reference genome of the MRSA S.
aureus COL (accession number CP000046) [32] using
SMALT (version 0.7.4; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/
tools/smalt-0) and SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms)
and indels (insertions/deletions) identified as described pre-
viously [31]. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were identi-
fied in the COL reference chromosome by comparison
with other S. aureus chromosomes, where BLASTN
(version 1.4) pairwise comparison were visualized in ACT
(version 13.0.0) [33]. Regions of recombination within core
genome and SCCmec element alignments were identified
with Gubbins using the default parameters (version 1.4.10;
http://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Gubbins) [34]. Phylo-
genetic reconstruction using core SNPs was performed
with RAxML (version 8.2.8), using a GTR model with a
gamma correction for among site rate variation [35].
Regions of high-SNP density corresponding to putative
regions of recombination and those SNPs associated with
horizontal gene transfer were excluded. Assembly of all
genomes was performed using a high throughput assembly
method [36].
In order to investigate if the genomic data contained
evidence of a temporal signal we used root to tip linear re-
gression using Path-O-Gen (version 1.4; http://tree.bio.e-
d.ac.uk/software/tempest/; Additional file 3: Figure S4). A
core alignment for 122 isolates for which precise dates of
isolation were available was used. MGEs and regions of
predicted recombination along with homoplastic SNPs
within these isolates were then also excluded. To estimate
evolutionary rates and time to most common recent an-
cestor (TMRCA) Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction
was performed using BEAST (version 1.7.4) [37]. A GTR
model with a gamma correction for among-site rate
variation was used, and all combinations of strict, relaxed
lognormal, and relaxed exponential clock models and
constant, exponential, expansion, and skyline population
models were evaluated. For each, three independent
chains were run for 100 million generations, sampling
every ten generations. On completion each model was
checked for convergence, both by checking effective sam-
ple size (ESS) values were greater than 200 for key param-
eters, and by checking independent runs had converged
on similar results. Models were compared for their fit to
the data using Bayes factors based on the harmonic mean
estimator as calculated by the program Tracer (version
1.4) from the BEAST package. A burn-in of ten million
states was removed from each of the three independent
runs of this model before combining the results from
those runs with the logcombiner program from the
BEAST package.
A previously described database of sequences of
known resistance determinant genes, both horizontally
acquired and core, was utilized as a resistome database
(Additional file 4: Table S3) [27, 38]. Fastq files from the
209 isolates were mapped to the resistome database with
SRST2 (version 0.1.8) using the default settings [39].
SNPs in chromosomally encoded genes previously iden-
tified as being associated with antimicrobial resistance
were then manually inspected to confirm the variation.
The multilocus sequence type (MLST) of isolates was
predicted using SRST2 (version 0.1.8) [39].
