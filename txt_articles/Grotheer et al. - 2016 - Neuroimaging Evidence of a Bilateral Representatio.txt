The clustered architecture of the brain for different visual stimulus categories is one of the most fascinating topics in the cognitive
neurosciences.Interestingly,recentresearchsuggeststheexistenceofadditionalregionsfornewlyacquiredstimulisuchasletters(letter
form area; LFA; Thesen et al., 2012) and numbers (visual number form area; NFA; Shum et al., 2013). However, neuroimaging methods
thus far have failed to visualize the NFA in healthy participants, likely due to fMRI signal dropout caused by the air/bone interface of the
petrous bone (Shum et al., 2013). In the current study, we combined a 64-channel head coil with high spatial resolution, localized
shimming, and liberal smoothing, thereby decreasing the signal dropout and increasing the temporal signal-to-noise ratio in the neigh-
borhood of the NFA. We presented subjects with numbers, letters, false numbers, false letters, objects and their Fourier randomized
versions. A group analysis showed significant activations in the inferior temporal gyrus at the previously proposed location of the NFA.
Crucially, we found the NFA to be present in both hemispheres. Further, we could identify the NFA on the single-subject level in most of
our participants. A detailed analysis of the response profile of the NFA in two separate experiments confirmed the whole-brain results
since responses to numbers were significantly higher than to any other presented stimulus in both hemispheres. Our results show for the
first time the existence and stimulus selectivity of the NFA in the healthy human brain.

Introduction
The ability to process numbers efficiently is crucial to our daily
lives. Simply consider how many numbers you encounter in a
typical day—between checking the time on your alarm clock to
choosing the right exit on your way home from work. Still, similar
to reading, this skill likely gained importance too recently to be
supported by human evolution (Dehaene and Cohen, 2011). In
this prospect, it is particularly remarkable that neuronal regions
selective for the processing of letters (Thesen et al., 2012), words
(Cohen et al., 2000), and numbers (Shum et al., 2013; Abboud et
al., 2015) have recently been described in the human brain (for a
recent review, see Hannagan et al. (2015)). The development and
specificity of these areas could provide tremendous insight into
the plastic processes of the brain. Unfortunately, as of today,
fMRI studies have failed to localize the number-selective visual
number form area (NFA) reliably in healthy participants. The
reason behind this failure is most probably related to the assumed
location of the area: artifacts caused by the air/bone interface of
the petrous bone lead to a strong signal dropout in this region
(Shum et al., 2013). Circumventing this problem, using electro-
corticography (ECoG), Shum et al. (2013) described a region in
the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) responding significantly stron-
ger to numbers than to false numbers or letters. The investiga-
tors focused their analysis on the right hemisphere, although

 in two participants, left hemispheric electrodes showed a com-
parable response pattern as well. More recently, Abboud et al.
(2015) tested in an fMRI study whether an auditory task in-
volving numerical symbols could induce number form activa-
tions in the visual system of congenitally blind participants. To
compensate for the strong signal dropout in the region, they
excluded those voxels with the lowest signal strength. Al-
though this approach condones the loss of data, Abboud et al.
(2015) could successfully identify activations in the right ITG
at the proposed location of the NFA. They also detected acti-
vations of a homologous region in the left ITG, which, how-
ever, did not survive the correction for multiple comparisons.
Interestingly, the presence of a representation for visual Ara-
bic number form has already been predicted by the triple-code
model of number processing published much earlier (De-
haene and Cohen, 1995). The same group even predicted the
NFA to be present bilaterally while speculating that the two
hemispheres might be specialized to support different tasks
(Cohen and Dehaene, 1995).
The current work is the first neuroimaging study focusing on
number form processing in healthy participants. We propose a
novel approach to overcome the fMRI signal dropout that im-
proves signal quality at the source and thus works without any
loss of data. By combining a 64-channel head coil with high spa-
tial resolution, GRAPPA acceleration, localized shimming, and
spatial smoothing, we were able to increase the signal strength
and the temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), thereby increasing
the detectability of the NFA. In contrast to previous studies (Polk
et al., 2002), this approach also allowed us to locate the NFA on an
individual subject level. This, in turn, enabled us to perform re-
gion of interest (ROI) analyses to visualize the selectivity of the
NFA in more detail. To briefly anticipate our results, we found
bilateral activations of the ITG at the proposed location of the
NFA when contrasting numbers with false numbers or with sev-
eral non-numerical stimuli. The ROI analysis, in two separate
experiments, confirmed the number specificity of these bilateral
clusters in the sense that numbers elicited significantly higher
responses than any other category. To test the specificity of these
results, we also performed similar analyses for the letter form area
(LFA), an area previously described to respond to letter form
(Thesen et al., 2012), and confirmed its
response selectivity for letters. The de-
tailed description of number-selective
(and letter-selective) clusters will greatly
facilitate our understanding of visual pro-
cessing and neuronal plasticity.
Materials and Methods
Experiment 1
This experiment was designed to visualize the
NFA in a group of healthy human subjects and
to describe the response selectivity of the NFA
is a detailed fashion.
Participants.
Twenty-four
right-handed,
healthy volunteers (16 female; mean age 25 � 4
years) participated in the experiment. One
subject was excluded due to technical difficul-
ties during the data acquisition and another
subject was excluded due to excessive head
movement during the recording (i.e., transla-
tion/rotation of �7 mm/degrees). All subjects
had normal or corrected to normal vision and
gave informed written consent in accordance
with the protocols approved by the ethical com-
mittees of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena.
Stimulation and procedure. Participants were presented with 7 differ-
ent stimulus categories. Arabic numbers (N), false numbers (FN), Fou-
rier randomized versions of numbers (noise numbers; NN), Roman
letters (L), false letters (FL), Fourier randomized versions of letters (noise
letters; NL), and objects (O) were presented in 20-s-long blocks contain-
ing 40 images each. Three 12-min-long runs were presented, each con-
taining 28 blocks and thus four presentations of each of the stimulus
categories. The blocks were presented in a pseudorandomized order so
that subsequent blocks did not contain the same category. Each block was
followed by a 10-s-long break. Within each block, stimuli were presented
for 300 ms, with a 200 ms interstimulus interval. The task of the partici-
pants was to detect immediate stimulus repetitions (1-back task) while
the number of targets within each block was randomized between 0 and
2. The number stimuli consisted of 40 Arabic numbers between 0 and 99.
All one-digit numbers were presented; the remaining numbers were two-
digit numbers chosen in a way that each numeral occurred with identical
probability. These stimuli were presented in 4 different font styles (Times
New Roman, Britannic Bold, Comic Sans, and Bradley Hand ITC) so that
they had different shapes and were trial unique during a run. Similarly, 24
capital and 16 small letters of the Roman alphabet were chosen (in par-
ticular, I, O, g, l, o, q, s, and u–y were excluded due to their apparent
similarity to other letters/numbers) and presented in the same fonts as
the numbers. The false characters were created from these numbers and
letters similarly to Grotheer and Kova
´cs (2014). In short, one to four
components of a particular character in a given font were moved ran-
domly to a different position, using Gimp 2.6 (for examples, see Fig. 1).
Fourier randomization of the original characters yielded the random
noise stimuli. Object stimuli were taken from the Bank of Standardized
Stimuli (BOSS; Brodeur et al., 2010). Stimuli were presented with a 3°
visual angle in the center of the screen on a uniform gray background and
back-projected via an LCD video projector onto a translucent circular
screen placed inside the scanner bore. Stimulus presentation was con-
trolled via Matlab (The MathWorks) using Psychtoolbox (version 3.0.9).
Imaging parameters and data analysis. A 3 T MR scanner (Siemens
MAGNETOM Prisma fit) with a 64-channel head coil was used. To ob-
tain a 3D structural scan, high-resolution sagittal T1-weighted images
were acquired using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo se-
quence (MP-RAGE, TR � 2300 ms, TE � 3.03 ms, 1 mm isotropic voxel
size). During stimulus presentation, we continuously acquired high-
resolution functional images of the ventral parts of the occipital and
temporal lobes (29 slices, T2*-weighted EPI sequence, TR � 2500 ms,
TE � 31 ms, flip angle � 90°, in-plane resolution: 1.0*1.0 mm 2, slice
thickness: 1.0 mm, partial Fourier factor 7/8). Previous studies (Shum et

 al., 2013; Abboud et al., 2015) predicted the NFA to be located in close
proximity to the tissue–air boundaries of the petrous bone and thus in an
area greatly affected by susceptibility changes. These susceptibility
changes are responsible for the commonly observed fMRI signal dropout
in the caudal–ventral part of the temporal lobes because they cause com-
plete magnetization dephasing within single voxels (Robinson et al.,
2004). We compensated for this signal loss by enhancing our functional
resolution to very small (1.0*1.0*1.0 mm 3) isotropic voxels, which, in
turn, reduces intravoxel dephasing (Merboldt et al., 2000; Wadghiri et al.,
2001; Bellgowan et al., 2006). This high spatial resolution was facilitated
by the enhanced SNR of the 64-channel head coil and by the 80 mT/m
gradient performance available in the Prisma fit system. The tSNR was
further increased during preprocessing by smoothing of the data; a
Gaussian kernel of 8 mm was used as this kernel size was suggested as
optimum (Mikl et al., 2008). Susceptibility-based image distortions were
reduced using GRAPPA (Griswold et al., 2002) with an acceleration fac-
tor of 3. In addition, before the EPI sequences, for a localized shimming
approach, a map of the static magnetic field (B0) was calculated based on
4 mm isotropic multiecho gradient echo data. Based on this B0 map, a
least-square optimization of shim currents was performed locally for the
proposed location of the NFA while taking care to always include the steep
B0 gradient at the caudal–ventral portions of the temporal lobes into the
shim volume. This additional shimming procedure took up to 5 min.
Details of preprocessing and statistical analysis were described previ-
ously (Cziraki et al., 2010). Briefly, the functional images were slice time
corrected, realigned, normalized to the MNI-152 space, and spatially
smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 8 mm full width at half maximum
(FWHM) using SPM12 (Welcome Department of Imaging Neurosci-
ence, London). Whole-brain analyses were performed using the flexible
factorial design of SPM12. To visualize the response selectivity of the
NFA further, we additionally performed ROI analyses using the MARS-
BAR 0.42 toolbox for SPM (Brett et al., 2002). To avoid double-dipping
(Kriegeskorte et al., 2009) during this analysis, the first run was used to
determine the ROIs and the remaining two runs were used to extract the
response profiles on a subject-by-subject basis. The NFA clusters were
determined by contrasting numbers with all other stimulus categories
(p � 0.001uncorrected) individually, whereas bilateral localization was suc-
cessful in 17 of the 22 participants (77.3%) [average MNI coordinates
(�SE) and cluster sizes (�SE): right hemisphere (n � 17): 55(2),
�50(2), �15(1) and 65(20); left hemisphere (n � 19): �54(2), �55(2),
�13(2) and 112(22)]. These coordinates are very similar to the coordi-
nates reported in previous electrophysiological studies (right hemi-
sphere: 51, �54, �24; Shum et al., 2013), studies of congenitally blind
patients (right hemisphere: 53, �44, �12; Abboud et al., 2015), as well as
to the peak coordinates of the whole-brain analysis of the current study
(right hemisphere: 61, �46, �18; left hemisphere �61, �54, �18). The
LFA cluster was determined by contrasting letters with all other stimuli
(p � 0.001uncorrected). Consistent with previous studies showing a left
hemispheric dominance for letter processing (Dehaene et al., 2010), the
LFA could only be reliably identified in the left hemisphere in most
participants [average MNI coordinates (�SE) and cluster size (�SE): left
hemisphere (n � 17): �47(1), �56(2), �14(1) and 143(24)]. The seven
experimental conditions (N, FN, NN, L, FL, NL, and O) were defined as
separate regressors and convolved with the canonical hemodynamic re-
sponse function (HRF) of SPM12 for a general linear model (GLM)
analysis of the data. A time series of the mean voxel value within the areas
of interest was calculated and extracted, using finite impulse response
(FIR) models (Ollinger et al., 2001). The plateau (TR 3–10) of the HRF
was averaged to perform repeated-measures ANOVAs. In the first
ANOVA, we defined hemisphere (2) and stimulus (7) as factors and
evaluated the number form area. To further understand the NFA results,
we performed a second ANOVA in which we left out the object stimuli
and used hemisphere (2), character type (2; number and letter), and
stimulus type (3; standard, false, and noise) as factors. Similar analyses
were performed for the LFA, but only for the left hemisphere. Post hoc
analyses were performed using Fisher LSD tests.
Experiment 2
The second experiment of the current study focused on the differential
response of the NFA to numbers and letters, particularly testing whether
the previously obtained response-profile remains for single-digit num-
bers as well.
Participants. For Experiment 2, 16 healthy volunteers (10 female; 15
right-handed, mean age 22 � 3 years) were recruited. All subjects had
normal or corrected to normal vision and gave informed written consent
in accordance with the protocols approved by the ethical committees of
the Friedrich Schiller University Jena.
Stimulation and procedure. Four experimental runs were acquired and
two of these runs were used to localize the NFA. These runs were similar
to Experiment 1 in all aspects, with the only exception that only the
single-digit numbers (0–9) and their corresponding false numbers and
Fourier randomized images were presented. To ensure that the number
of stimuli was matched across conditions, 10 capital letters were selected
and presented together with their corresponding false versions and Fou-
rier randomized images. All stimuli were presented in four different font
styles so that they were trial unique during a block. Therefore, 40 differ-
ent objects were presented in these runs. Because the main focus of this
experiment was the differential response of the NFA to numbers and
letters, in the remaining two runs, only numbers, letters, and false num-
bers were presented. Runs were presented in an alternating order, begin-
ning with a run used for localization.
Imaging parameters and data analysis. Imaging parameters and data
preprocessing were similar to Experiment 1. The two localizer runs were
used to determine the NFA on an individual subject level, whereas bilat-
eral localization was successful in 14 of the 16 participants (87.5%) [p �
0.005; average MNI coordinates (�SE) and cluster sizes (�SE): right
hemisphere (n � 14): 53(2), �63(3), �12(1) and 86(30); left hemisphere
(n � 14): �54(2), �62(4), �12(2) and 119(25)]. The response profiles
of these ROIs were extracted on a subject-by-subject basis from the re-
maining two runs. The three experimental conditions (N, FN, and L)
were defined as separate regressors and convolved with the canonical
HRF of SPM12, for a GLM analysis of the data. Similar to Experiment 1,
a time series of the mean voxel value within the areas of interest was
calculated and extracted using FIR models. The plateau (TR 3–10) of the
HRF was averaged to perform a repeated-measures ANOVA with hemi-
sphere (2) and stimulus (3) as factors. Post hoc analyses were performed
using Fisher LSD tests. Every other detail was identical to those of
Experiment 1.
Experiment 3
The third experiment was designed to test whether the special method-
ological and processing steps of the current study (such as the high spatial
resolution of the recording, the localized shimming, and the spatial
smoothing applied during preprocessing) are all mandatory to visualize
the NFA.
Participants. Thirteen healthy human volunteers (7 female; 13 right-
handed, mean age 24 � 1 years) participated in Experiment 3. One
subject was excluded from the study due to inaccurate slice positioning
and a resulting partial lack of data from the anterior temporal cortex. All
subjects gave informed written consent in accordance with ethical com-
mittees of the Friedrich Schiller University Jena and had normal or cor-
rected to normal vision.
Imaging parameters and data analysis. In our aim to visualize the NFA
in healthy participants, in the current study, we combined high-
resolution imaging with liberal smoothing and a localized shimming
approach in an attempt to compensate the previously described fMRI
signal dropout near the ear canal (Shum et al., 2013). To test the validity
of this approach, we recorded a group of participants and compared our
parameters (29 slices, T2* weighted EPI sequence, TR � 2500 ms, TE �
31 ms, flip angle � 90°, in-plane resolution: 1.0*1.0 mm 2, slice thickness:
1.0 mm, partial Fourier factor 7/8, GRAPPA with an acceleration factor
of 3, localized shimming) with a commonly used lower-resolution scan-
ning sequence (47 slices, T2* weighted EPI sequence, TR � 2500 ms,
TE � 30 ms, flip angle � 90°, in-plane resolution: 3.0*3.0 mm 2, slice
thickness: 3.0 mm, GRAPPA with an acceleration factor of 2) with and
without an additional localized shimming. Stimuli, paradigm, and task

 were identical to the runs used for localization in Experiment 2, as de-
scribed above. Only one run was recorded for each of the sequences; the
order of acquisition was counterbalanced across participants. We calcu-
lated images of the mean BOLD signal and the tSNR before and after the
smoothing of the data. The mean BOLD signal is a measure of the overall
signal intensity and was used to evaluate whether the fMRI signal drop-
out in the neighborhood of the NFA could be restricted successfully. It
was calculated by averaging the realigned and normalized functional
images. Conversely, the tSNR is a measure of image quality and particu-
larly expresses the detectability of BOLD signal changes of interest (Mur-
phy et al., 2007). tSNR was calculated by dividing the mean image by the
SD of the images. Values were extracted from the peak voxel of the left
and right NFA (defined on the basis of the group analysis in Experiment
1, MNI coordinates [x, y, z]: 61, �45, �17 and �60, �57, �17) to
perform repeated-measures ANOVAs testing for the effect of hemisphere
(2), sequence (3, high resolution, lower resolution with shimming and
lower resolution without shimming), and smoothing (2) for both
measures.
Results
Experiment 1
Behavioral data
The participants’ performance and reaction times (RTs) were
dependent on the presented stimulus (main effect of stimulus:
F(6,126) � 13.61, p � 0.0001, �p2 � 0.39 and F(6,120) � 3.08, p �
0.008, �p2 � 0.13; for performance and RTs, respectively). This
effect was, however, mainly driven by the Fourier randomized
images for which, expectedly, performance dropped (p � 0.0004
for all comparisons) and RTs (NL: p � 0.11 for all comparisons)
increased compared with all other stimuli. Interestingly, we also
observed that participants performed better for letters than for
false letters (p � 0.03) and objects (p � 0.04).
Whole-brain analyses
To determine whether an area selective for visually presented
numbers could be detected, in Experiment 1, we contrasted num-
bers with false numbers or with all other stimulus categories in
two separate analyses (pFWE � 0.05, cluster extend � 20 voxels).
Contrasting numbers with false numbers revealed activations in
the ITG in both hemispheres (MNI coordinates: 61, �46, �18
and �61, �54, �18; cluster sizes: 216 and 46 voxels for the right
and left hemispheres, respectively; Fig. 2). These activations were
also confirmed when numbers were contrasted against every
other stimulus category (MNI coordinates: 61, �45, �17 and
�60, �57, �17; cluster sizes: 175 and 3149 voxels). Contrasting
numbers with all other stimuli showed additional bilateral acti-
vation in the fusiform gyrus (MNI coordinates: 42, �49, �17 and
�46, �57, �15; cluster sizes: 597 and 3149 voxels), as well as in
the early visual cortex (MNI coordinates: 5, �79, �0 and �8,
�87, 2; cluster sizes: 424 and 26 voxels). The location of the
observed number-selective activations was similar to those re-
ported previously for the right hemisphere (51, �54, �24; Shum
et al., 2013; and 53, �44, �12; Abboud et al., 2015).
To test whether the LFA is present in both hemispheres as well,
we performed similar analyses testing letters against false letters
and against all other stimulus categories (pFWE � 0.05, cluster
extend � 20 voxels). In contrast to the NFA, the LFA could only
be determined reliably in the left hemisphere (Fig. 2). Contrast-
ing letters with false letters revealed one cluster of activation in
the left fusiform gyrus (MNI coordinates: �49, �59, �21; cluster
size: 1033 voxels), which was confirmed when letters were con-
trasted with all other stimuli (MNI coordinates: �46, �59, �15;
cluster size: 4389 voxels). Interestingly, contrasting letters with

 false letters also revealed a small cluster of activation in the right
ITG (MNI coordinates: 64, �48, �16; cluster size: 386 voxels),
which, however, could not be confirmed when comparing letters
against all other stimuli. Conversely, contrasting letters with all
other stimuli showed additional clusters in the right fusiform
gyrus (MNI coordinates: 43, �47, �22; cluster size: 138 voxels),
the right early visual cortex (MNI coordinates: 6, �73, �2; clus-
ter size: 75 voxels), and an area in the left middle occipital gyrus
(MNI coordinates: �43, �86, 0; cluster size: 169 voxels) closely
related to the classical coordinates for the lateral occipital com-
plex (Grill-Spector et al., 1999).
In summary, we could identify both the NFA and the LFA in
our healthy participant group and, crucially, determined the NFA
to be present in both hemispheres.
ROI analyses
We performed ROI analyses for the left LFA and the left and right
NFAs to visualize their response selectivity in more detail. For

 this, we determined the NFA/LFA ROIs on an individual level
by contrasting numbers/letters with all other stimuli (p �
0.001(uncorrected); Fig. 3A,B). To avoid double-dipping, we used
only the first experimental run to determine the ROIs. This ap-
proach, however, rests upon the assumption that one run is suf-
ficient to successfully identify the NFA. We tested this
assumption empirically by superimposing on top of each other
the results of the number versus all other stimuli contrast for the
three runs (p � 0.005(uncorrected)). As Figure 3C shows, there is a
strong and clear correspondence in the location of the NFA
across runs, supporting the conclusion that one run is sufficient
to identify the area. In the LFA, we found a main effect of stimulus
(F(6,96) � 18.32, p � 0.0001, �p2 � 0.53), whereas activations
were higher for letters than for any other stimulus category (L �
N: p � 0.04; L � FN: p � 0.004; L � NN: p � 0.0001; L � FL: p �
0.0007; L � NL: p � 0.0001; L � O: p � 0.02; see Fig. 3D). A main
effect of stimulus (F(6,96) � 9.47, p � 0.0001, �p2 � 0.37) was also
found in the NFA. Crucially, this effect was similar in both hemi-
spheres because neither a significant main effect of hemisphere
(F(1,16) � 0.19, p � 0.67, �p2 � 0.01) nor a significant interaction
of stimulus and hemisphere (F(6,96) � 0.95, p � 0.47, �p2 � 0.06)
was observed. Post hoc analyses revealed larger activations for
numbers than for any other stimulus category in the right (N �
FN: p � 0.006; N � NN: p � 0.0001; N � L: p � 0.009; N � FL:
p � 0.0002; N � NL: p � 0.0001; N � O: p � 0.02) and also in the
left hemisphere (N � FN: p � 0.0001; N � NN: p � 0.0001; N �
L: p � 0.05; N � FL: p � 0.0001; N � NL: p � 0.0001; N � O: p �
0.0001). Interestingly, letters also induced significantly larger
neuronal responses than false stimuli and objects in the left hemi-
sphere (L � FN: p � 0.01; L � NN: p � 0.0001; L � FL: p � 0.005;
L � NL: p � 0.001; L � O: p � 0.02), but not in the right
hemisphere (L � FN: p � 0.87; L � NN: p � 0.04; L � FL: p �
0.26; L � NL: p � 0.003; L � O: p � 0.79) of the NFA. To further
understand these results, we performed a second ANOVA in
which we used hemisphere (2), character type (2; number and
letter), and stimulus type (3; standard, false and noise) as factors
but left out the object stimuli. In the LFA, this analysis revealed no
effect of character type (F(1,16) � 0.19, p � 0.67, �p2 � 0.01), but
a main effect of stimulus type (F(2,32) � 26.23, p � 0.0001, �p2 �
0.62) and an interaction between character type and stimulus
type (F(2,32) � 8.49, p � 0.001, �p2 � 0.35). Post hoc analyses
revealed a significant difference between numbers and letters
only for the standard stimuli (standard: p � 0.001; false: p � 0.32;
noise: p � 0.09). In the NFA, we observed a main effect of char-
acter type (F(1,16) � 39.59, p � 0.0001, �p2 � 0.71) and stimulus
type (F(2,32) � 11.40, p � 0.0002, �p2 � 0.42), but no interaction
between character type and stimulus type (F(2,32) � 1.53, p �
0.23, �p2 � 0.09). Crucially, again, no main effect of hemisphere
(F(1,16) � 0.11, p � 0.74, �p2 � 0.007) and no interaction of
hemisphere with any other factor (p � 0.28 for all comparisons)
was observed. Therefore, the ROI analyses confirm the results of
the whole-brain analyses regarding the bilateral nature of the
NFA and suggest a similar function for both hemispheres.
Experiment 2
Behavioral data
In this experiment, we only presented numbers, letters, and false
numbers. We did not observe a main effect of stimulus either on
the participants’ accuracy (F(2,30) � 2.08, p � 0.14, �p2 � 0.12) or
on their RTs (F(2,30) � 0.73, p � 0.49, �p2 � 0.05).
ROI analysis
In Experiment 2 (Fig. 4), we could again identify the right and left
NFA on an individual participant level by contrasting numbers
with all other presented visual stimuli in two experimental runs
(p � 0.005(uncorrected)). In the remaining two runs, we only pre-
sented numbers, letters, and false numbers to visualize the re-
sponse selectivity of the NFA for these stimuli in more detail.
Crucially, in contrast to Experiment 1, only single-digit numbers
were used. Similar to Experiment 1, we found no main effect of
hemisphere (F(1,13) � 2.85, p � 0.12, �p2 � 0.18) and no inter-
action of hemisphere and stimulus (F(2,26) � 0.11, p � 0.90,
�p2 � 0.008). We again observed a main effect of stimulus (F(2,26)
� 7.54, p � 0.003, �p2 � 0.37) that was based on the fact that
responses to numbers were significantly larger than responses to
letters and false letters in both the right (N � FN: p � 0.008; N �
L: p � 0.007) and the left hemisphere (N � FN: p � 0.006; N � L:
p � 0.02). Therefore, Experiment 2 confirmed the number selec-
tivity and the bilateral nature of the visual number form area
found in Experiment 1.
Experiment 3
Mean BOLD signal within the NFA
Figure 5A depicts the average BOLD signal for the three different
sequence conditions globally. Within the NFA, we observed a
main effect of sequence (F(2,22) � 49.48, p � 0.0001, �p2 � 0.82)
on the mean BOLD signal, which was driven by the fact that
high-resolution images had a higher signal intensity in the NFA
compared with lower-resolution images with (p � 0.0001) and
without (p � 0.0001) localized shimming (Fig. 6A). The lower-
resolution images with and without localized shimming were not
significantly different from each other (p � 0.92), suggesting that
spatial resolution but not localized shimming influences the
BOLD signal intensity. We further found an interaction between
sequence and smoothing (F(2,22) � 4.43, p � 0.02, �p2 � 0.29)
because smoothing reduced the mean BOLD signal of the high-
resolution images (p � 0.009) but not of the lower-resolution
images with (p � 0.93) and without (p � 0.21) localized shim-
ming. Crucially, however, even after smoothing, the high-
resolution images showed a higher mean BOLD signal within the
NFA than the lower-resolution images with (p � 0.0001) and
without (p � 0.0001) localized shimming. No main effect of
hemisphere (F(1,11) � 0.99, p � 0.34, �p2 � 0.08) and no inter-
action of hemisphere with any other factor was found (p � 0.05
for all comparisons). Overall, these results confirm previous re-

al., 2006) suggesting that smaller voxels reduce intravoxel de-
phasing and thus fMRI signal dropout caused by susceptibility
artifacts.
tSNR within the NFA
For the tSNR, we again observed a main effect of sequence
(F(2,22) � 14.90, p � 0.0001, �p2 � 0.58) within the NFA, which
expressed the fact that, overall, the high-resolution images had a
larger tSNR than the lower-resolution images with (p � 0.0003)
and without (p � 0.0001) localized shimming (Fig. 6B; for the
global effects of sequence and smoothing on the tSNR, see Fig.
5A). Similar to the mean BOLD signal, the tSNR of the lower-
resolution images with and without localized shimming were not
significantly different (p � 0.51), suggesting that spatial resolu-
tion but not localized shimming influences the tSNR. Further, we
found a main effect of smoothing (F(1,11) � 198.58, p � 0.0001,
�p2 � 0.95) because the tSNR was significantly larger in the
high-resolution images (p � 0.0001), the lower-resolution im-
ages with localized shimming (p � 0.0001), and the lower-
resolution images without localized shimming (p � 0.0001) after
smoothing was applied. Crucially, we also observed an interac-
tion of sequence and smoothing (F(2,22) � 26.08, p � 0.0001, �p2
� 0.70). Before spatial smoothing was performed, the tSNR was
similar in the high-resolution images and the lower-resolution
images with (p � 0.71) and without (p � 0.61) localized shim-
ming. After smoothing, however, the tSNR was significantly
larger for the high-resolution images compared with the lower-
resolution images with (p � 0.0001) and without (p � 0.0001)
localized shimming. Similar to the mean BOLD signal, the tSNR
was not different across hemispheres (F(1,11) � 0161, p � 0.23,
�p2 � 0.13) and no interaction of hemisphere with sequence
(F(2,22) � 0.17, p � 0.84, �p2 � 0.02) or with sequence and
smoothing (F(2,22) � 0.09, p � 0.91, �p2 � 0.008) was observed.
We did, however, find an interaction between hemisphere and
smoothing (F(1,11) � 8.90, p � 0.01, �p2 � 0.45), suggesting that
the beneficial effect of smoothing was particularly pronounced in
the left hemisphere, even though smoothing significantly influ-
enced the tSNR in both hemispheres (right hemisphere: p �
0.0001, left hemisphere: p � 0.0001). Overall, these results con-
firm those previous findings suggesting an improved tSNR when

Discussion
In the current study, we investigated the processing of visually
presented numbers in healthy human subjects. We identified
an area in the ITG, which responds stronger to numbers than
to false numbers, letters or everyday objects. This area, the
NFA, was found at virtually identical coordinates, as indicated
in previous patient studies (Shum et al., 2013; Abboud et al.,
2015), with the important difference that we found the NFA to
be present bilaterally.
Before the current study, the NFA could not be reliably iden-
tified in healthy human subjects. This is most probably due to
artifacts caused by the air/bone interface of the petrous bone in
the neighborhood of the NFA (Shum et al., 2013). To overcome
these susceptibly artifacts, we combined the application of a 64-
channel head coil with high spatial resolution, localized shim-
ming, parallel imaging, and liberal smoothing at 3 T. All of these
factors were designed to increase the signal strength and the tSNR
and thereby the detectability of BOLD signal changes. There are
three different noise contributions in fMRI which hinder the
detection of meaningful signal changes—thermal noise, scanner
noise and physiological noise. Signal detectability, as reflected by
the tSNR, is proposed to be optimal when thermal/scanner noise
is equal to the physiological noise (Bodurka et al., 2007). In our
case, the usage of a multichannel head coil increased the signal
strength but also the physiological noise contribution (Bodurka
et al., 2004; de Zwart et al., 2004; Triantafyllou et al., 2011).
Therefore, it allowed us to record images at a high spatial resolu-
tion and to use parallel imaging without severe losses in tSNR
(Triantafyllou et al., 2006; Triantafyllou et al., 2011). After all, the
increased resolution and GRAPPA acceleration are accompanied
by an increase in thermal/scanner noise (Triantafyllou et al.,
2006), which balances the physiological noise picked up by the
multichannel head coil. This high spatial resolution and the par-
allel imaging were needed to prevent complete magnetization
dephasing within single voxels and thus
fMRI signal dropout caused by the sus-
ceptibility changes (Merboldt et al., 2000;
Wadghiri et al., 2001; Bellgowan et al.,
2006). To compensate for the increased
thermal/scanner
noise
accompanying
higher spatial resolution further, we
smoothed our data with a quite liberal
Gaussian
kernel
of
8
mm
FWHM.
Smoothing was shown to recover the
tSNR of high-resolution images to the
level of lower-resolution images (Molloy
et al., 2014) or even beyond (Triantafyllou
et al., 2006). Therefore, by combining all
of these factors, we were able to optimize
the signal strength and the tSNR, which
allowed us to localize the NFA in healthy
human subjects using fMRI.
Interestingly, in the current study, the
NFA was found in both hemispheres. In
contrast, a recent EEG study suggests a
right-hemispheric lateralization of visual
number processing (Park et al., 2014). It
is, however, not clear where in the brain
this lateralization originates. In fact, the
same group found evidence for lateralized
number processing in the right lateral occipital complex, but
failed to find number-related activations along the ITG (Park et
al., 2012). Further, in an EcoG study, Shum et al. (2013) pre-
sented their participants with numbers and various non-
numerical stimuli and found number-selective activations in the
ITG. However, they had only two patients with left and five pa-
tients with right hemispheric implants available and thus focused
their analysis on the right hemisphere. Abboud et al. (2015) used
an fMRI whole-brain approach and detected numerical task-
related activations in congenitally blind participants in the right
hemispheric ITG. These investigators also reported activations in
the left hemisphere, which, however, did not survive familywise
error corrections. There are many reasons that could account for
the difference in lateralization observed in this and in the current
study. First, Abboud et al. (2015) compensated for the fMRI sig-
nal loss described in close proximity to the NFA (Shum et al.,
2013) by excluding those voxels with the lowest signal strengths.
Therefore, it is possible that too few number-selective voxels re-
mained in the left hemisphere. In contrast, our approach has the
advantage that all voxels in the occipitotemporal cortex could be
sampled. Nonetheless, it is crucial to point out that the approach
of Abboud et al. (2015) is very useful, especially in an environ-
ment where high-resolution fMRI, parallel imaging techniques,
and/or the shimming technique of the present study are not avail-
able. We achieved the necessary high spatial resolution partially
by reducing the number of slices and by increasing the time of
repetition (TR). The relatively long (2.5 s) TR reduced the tem-
poral resolution of the measurements. Due to the reduced num-
ber of slices, we were also unable to cover the entire cerebrum of
the participants. In particular, we could not simultaneously sam-
ple the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), a region indicated to be in-
volved in numerosity processing (Eger et al., 2003). We accepted
this constrain as our main focus of interest was the visual process-
ing of number forms. Future studies should decide carefully
which approach to take depending on the question at hand,
whereas a combination of the two approaches might be particu-
larly valuable, possibly even for other neuronal regions similarly

 affected by susceptibility artifacts (e.g., the anterior temporal face
patch; Rajimehr et al., 2009).
Other obvious factors that could account for the differences in
lateralization between previous work (Abboud et al., 2015) and
the current study are the tested participants and the applied task.
In the current study, we investigated healthy participants with a
simple visual one-back task, Abboud et al. (2015) tested congen-
itally blind patients with a rather complex numerosity task. It
seems plausible that the activations observed in the current study
depend on simple bottom-up visual input (because number
identification is not actually needed for the task at hand), whereas
the study by Abboud et al. (2015) detects task-dependent top-
down influences (because visual input is lacking in the patients).
The interplay of top-down and bottom-up influences on the NFA
will certainly be a fruitful topic for future studies. Interestingly,
the presence of a bilateral Arabic number form area was suggested
already 20 years ago, and the investigators even proposed the two
hemispheres to be specialized for different tasks (Cohen and De-
haene, 1995). This task-dependent laterality for number process-
ing has been supported empirically for the IPS and its connecting
prefrontal regions (Chochon et al., 1999). This interaction of task
and lateralization certainly deserve further investigation in future
studies.
Interestingly, in Experiment 1, we observed a main effect of
character type and stimulus type, but no interaction between
these factors in the NFA. This suggests that the NFA prefers num-
bers over letters, but that it also generally prefers real over false
characters and Fourier randomized images. The potential rea-
sons behind this surprising preference are manifold. For instance,
it is possible that the NFA is generally tuned to objects of exper-
tise. Further, there might be an overlap in the spatial location of
the NFA and the LFA, which expresses in overlapping selectivity.
Finally, the real letters might simply be more similar to real num-
bers, and thus the preferred stimulus of the area, than false letters.
Although our data clearly show real numbers to be the “optimal”
stimulus for the NFA, future studies will be needed to investigate
these issues in detail.
It is important to note that numbers (as well as letters and
words) gained importance for human life too recently for spe-
cialized neuronal regions to be established by evolutionary
processes. Rather, it seems that learning during the lifespan of
the individual reorganizes the brain to support the processing
of these stimuli (Dehaene and Cohen, 2007). Interestingly, in
macaque monkeys, intensive early life training induces selec-
tive neuronal clusters for learned characters in the temporal
lobe as well (Srihasam et al., 2012). These clusters, in turn,
were shown to increase the monkeys’ performance on a char-
acter discrimination task, thereby emphasizing the functional
relevance of these acquired character-processing modules.
Crucially, neuronal clusters for learned visual stimuli seem to
develop in stable locations across subjects. In fact, in a very
recent review, Hannagan et al. (2015) propose two constrains
that determine the localization of the NFA and the LFA. On
the one hand, number and letter form processing is dependent
on invariant shape discrimination, a task fulfilled by the infe-
rior temporal cortex (Sa
´ry et al., 1993). On the other hand,
these regions depend on different functional connectivities;
that is, the LFA needs to be connected to other regions sup-
porting reading, whereas the NFA should rather be connected
to regions involved in representing quantities. These two con-
straints likely complement each other and thus explain the
consistent localization of number form and letter form pro-
cessing regions.
In summary, the current study demonstrates the existence of a
bilateral visual number form area in healthy human adults. Fur-
ther investigations into the neural representations of numbers
and other newly acquired stimulus categories will greatly advance
our understanding of learning-induced changes in the brain.
