Summary
We thought that the rate of postoperative pulmonary complications might be higher after pressure-controlled ventila-
tion than after volume-controlled ventilation. We analysed peri-operative data recorded for 109,360 adults, whose
lungs were mechanically ventilated during surgery at three hospitals in Massachusetts, USA. We used multivariable
regression and propensity score matching. Postoperative pulmonary complications were more common after pres-
sure-controlled ventilation, odds ratio (95%CI) 1.29 (1.21–1.37), p < 0.001. Tidal volumes and driving pressures were
more varied with pressure-controlled ventilation compared with volume-controlled ventilation: mean (SD) variance
from the median 1.61 (1.36) ml.kg�1 vs. 1.23 (1.11) ml.kg�1, p < 0.001; and 3.91 (3.47) cmH2O vs. 3.40
(2.69) cmH2O, p < 0.001. The odds ratio (95%CI) of pulmonary complications after pressure-controlled ventilation
compared with volume-controlled ventilation at positive end-expiratory pressures < 5 cmH2O was 1.40 (1.26–1.55)
and 1.20 (1.11–1.31) when ≥ 5 cmH2O, both p < 0.001, a relative risk ratio of 1.17 (1.03–1.33), p = 0.023. The odds
ratio (95%CI) of pulmonary complications after pressure-controlled ventilation compared with volume-controlled
ventilation at driving pressures of < 19 cmH2O was 1.37 (1.27–1.48), p < 0.001, and 1.16 (1.04–1.30) when
≥ 19 cmH2O, p = 0.011, a relative risk ratio of 1.18 (1.07–1.30), p = 0.016. Our data support volume-controlled ven-
tilation during surgery, particularly for patients more likely to suffer postoperative pulmonary complications.

 Introduction
Mortality and morbidity are reduced in patients with
acute respiratory distress syndrome by ventilating their
lungs with a combination of relatively small tidal vol-
umes, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and low
plateau pressures [1]. Similar intra-operative ventila-
tory strategies might reduce postoperative pulmonary
complications in populations without acute respiratory
distress, whose lungs are often ventilated with higher
volumes with little or no end-expiratory pressure
[2–8].
Pulmonary
ventilation,
controlled
by
volume
rather than pressure, might modify the rate of postop-
erative pulmonary complications, even though studies
in patients with acute lung injury have not shown sig-
nificant differences [9, 10]. Postoperative pulmonary
complications
are
associated
with
intra-operative
PEEP, ventilatory driving pressure and oxygen partial
pressure [2, 11–15]. Studies have reported effects of
pressure-controlled vs. volume-controlled intra-opera-
tive ventilation on physiological variables but not clini-
cal pulmonary outcomes [16, 17].
We assessed whether the rate of pulmonary com-
plications after pressure-controlled ventilation during
surgery was higher than that after volume-controlled
ventilation.
Methods
The Institutional Review Board at the Massachusetts
General Hospital approved the study. We analysed
data for adults whose lungs were mechanically venti-
lated via a tracheal tube during surgery at one of three
hospitals in Massachusetts, USA between January 2007
and December 2015. We did not study patients with
pulmonary complications in the seven days before sur-
gery, those who were not extubated immediately after
surgery, those with ASA physical status 6 and those
with missing data.
We categorised patients by the mode of ventilation
(pressure or volume control) that was used most dur-
ing an operation. The primary outcome was major
pulmonary complications within seven postoperative
days, a composite of re-intubation, pulmonary oedema,
pulmonary failure or pneumonia, as defined by the
ninth and tenth revisions of the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases codes and by Current Procedural
Terminology codes (see also Supporting Information,
Table S1) [2, 17–19]. We regressed mode of ventilation

We used these covariates to calculate a propensity
score to minimise the effects of observed confounding
by matching patients ventilated with each mode. We
performed nearest-neighbour matching with a caliper
of 0.1 times the standard deviation of the logit of the
estimated propensity score in a 1:1 fashion using a
greedy algorithm. We performed a subgroup analysis
of patients who had abdominal surgery. We further
analysed the risk of high tidal volume ventilation and
high driving pressure ventilation.
We performed subgroup analyses of the associa-
tion of postoperative pulmonary complications with
mode of ventilation classified by: ASA physical status
(< 3 vs. ≥ 3); SPORC (Score for Prediction of Postop-
erative Respiratory Complications) (< 7 vs. ≥ 7); and
PEEP (< 5 cmH2O vs. ≥ 5 cmH2O). We explored
whether any association of ventilatory mode and post-
operative pulmonary complications interacted with
high tidal volumes, high inspiratory plateau pressures
and PEEP. We included these interaction terms one by
one in the full regression model. We performed several
sensitivity analyses, which are described in the online
Supporting Information.
We used a mixed-effects logistic regression model
with ventilatory mode as the exposure variable, the
primary anaesthesia provider as a random effect and
other covariates as fixed effect. We used complete
cases for the primary analysis. We evaluated the poten-
tial for bias arising from missing data by repeating this
analysis using multiple imputations by chained equa-
tions [20]. We used Stata version 13 or 14 (StataCorp
LLC, TX, USA) for all analyses. We considered two-
tailed p < 0.05 statistically significant.
Results
Pressure control was used to ventilate the lungs of
18,268 of 109,360 (17%) patients, of whom 18,085
were matched with 18,085 of 91,092 patients ventilated
with volume control, within the caliper limit of the
propensity score (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The pressures
and volumes delivered by the two ventilatory modes
were different: pressure-controlled ventilation delivered
more varied, as well as higher, driving pressures and
tidal
volumes
than
volume-controlled
ventilation
(Table 2 and Fig. 2).
Pulmonary complications were more common after
pressure-controlled ventilation in both the unmatched
cohort and that matched for propensity score (Table 3).
The odds ratio (OR) (95%CI) for pulmonary complica-
tions, 1.29 (1.21–1.37), was unaffected by adjustment for
anaesthesia provider, 1.28 (1.20–1.37), p = 0.87, or by
imputation for missing data, 1.28 (1.21–1.36), p = 0.86.

Bagchi et al. | Postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation
 Postoperative pulmonary complications were more fre-
quent after pressure-controlled ventilation than volume-
controlled ventilation when we categorised patients by
PEEP, ASA physical status, predicted rate of pulmonary
complications (SPORC) and ventilatory driving pres-
sures (Table 4). The rates of pulmonary complications
were not associated with ventilatory mode when tidal
volumes exceeded 12 ml.kg�1.
The association of ventilatory mode and rates of
postoperative pulmonary complications was modified
by three variables, OR (95%CI): tidal volume (within
two standard deviations of the mean vs. < 5 ml.kg�1
or > 12 ml.kg�1), 0.65 (0.52–0.81), p < 0.001; driving
pressure (within one standard deviation of the mean
vs. < 10 cmH2O or > 19 cmH2O), 0.87 (0.77–0.99),
p = 0.025; and PEEP (≥ 5 cmH2O vs. < 5 cmH2O),
0.82 (0.73–0.92), p = 0.001 (see also Supporting Infor-
mation, Table S4 and Fig. S2).
There were 23,222 patients (21.2%) ventilated for
abdominal surgery: 3426 (14.8%) with pressure control

 and 19,796 (85.2%) with volume control (see also
Supporting Information, Table S2). The rate of postopera-
tive pulmonary complications was higher after pressure-
controlled ventilation than volume-controlled ventilation,
1.56 (1.36–1.80), p < 0.001 (see also Supporting Informa-
tion, Table S3). Pressure-controlled ventilation was more
frequently associated with driving pressures > 19 cmH2O,
1.21 (1.10–1.34), p < 0.001, but not with tidal volumes
> 12 ml.kg�1, 1.16 (0.96–1.40), p = 0.12 (Table S3).
Discussion
We found that the rate of postoperative pulmonary com-
plications was higher when intra-operative ventilation
was controlled by pressure than when it was controlled
by volume. Pressure-controlled ventilation resulted in
more variable tidal volumes and driving pressures and
more frequent delivery of extreme values (> 12 ml.kg�1
predicted body weight and > 19 cmH2O, respectively).

Bagchi et al. | Postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with pressure-controlled or volume-controlled ventilation
 pulmonary complications was most marked with low
PEEP.
Postoperative pulmonary complications are asso-
ciated with mortality and morbidity, which contribute
to surgical harm and costs [22–24]. Pulmonary post-
operative complications are more frequent than any
other, even in academic centres that use ‘lung-protec-
tive’ strategies [23, 25]. Some trials and systematic
reviews have reported no differences in physiological
measurements with ventilatory mode while others
have [16, 17, 26–31]. Pulmonary system compliance
changes during surgery, for instance, with patient
positioning, pneumoperitoneum,
abdominal content
retraction or packing, and fluid infusion or loss. The
tidal volumes delivered by pressure-controlled ventila-
tion will therefore vary and may become large after
a sudden increase in compliance, while volume-con-
trolled
ventilation
should
deliver
more
consistent
tidal volumes. Driving pressure, which is the inspira-
tory plateau pressure minus the end-expiratory pres-
sure, may be a more important determinant of lung
damage than tidal volume [2, 32, 33]. Pressure-con-
trolled
ventilation
delivered
driving
pressures
> 19 cmH2O more often than volume-controlled ven-
tilation, either because higher inspiratory pressures
were set or lower expiratory pressures were set.
Values
of
PEEP
> 5 cmH2O
were
associated
with fewer postoperative pulmonary complications,
which agree with other studies [2, 11, 12, 34]. A
plausible mechanism is a reduction in cyclical col-
lapse and opening of lung segments and subsequent
inflammation, which would be accompanied by vari-
able tidal volumes with pressure-controlled ventila-
tion [35]. Pulmonary complications were consistently
less with volume-controlled ventilation when we cat-
egorised patients by ASA physical status and patient
susceptibility to postoperative pulmonary complica-
tions [19, 36].
Like any observational study, our results might be
biased by unmeasured confounding factors and the
misclassification of outcomes. In addition, we used a
composite
outcome
to
define
‘pulmonary
failure’.
However, our administrative dataset has been vali-
dated, as has the use of this outcome [19, 37], and we
have no reason to think that its classification should
differ with ventilatory mode [38].
We believe that appropriate PEEP and the min-
imisation of driving pressure are key to reducing pul-
monary damage [2]. We think that damage associated
with
pressure-controlled
ventilation
is
mediated
through increased strain caused by erratic driving pres-
sures and tidal volumes [1, 32, 33, 39, 40].
In summary, we showed that rates of postopera-
tive pulmonary complications are higher after pres-
sure-controlled
ventilation
than
after
volume-
controlled ventilation, in part due to more variable
and higher driving pressures and tidal volumes, exac-
erbated by low or no PEEP. Our data support volume-
controlled ventilation during surgery, particularly for
patients more likely to suffer postoperative pul-
monary complications.
