SUMMARY
Antibodies with ontogenies from VH1-2 or VH1-46-
germline genes dominate the broadly neutralizing
response against the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) on
HIV-1. Here, we define with longitudinal sampling
from time-of-infection the development of a VH1-
46-derived
antibody
lineage
that
matured
to
neutralize 90% of HIV-1 isolates. Structures of
lineage antibodies CH235 (week 41 from time-of-
infection, 18% breadth), CH235.9 (week 152, 77%),
and CH235.12 (week 323, 90%) demonstrated the
maturing epitope to focus on the conformationally
invariant portion of the CD4bs. Similarities between
CH235 lineage and five unrelated CD4bs lineages
in
epitope
focusing,
length-of-time
to
develop
breadth, and extraordinary level of somatic hyper-
mutation suggested commonalities in maturation
among all CD4bs antibodies. Fortunately, the re-
quired CH235-lineage hypermutation appeared sub-
stantially guided by the intrinsic mutability of the
VH1-46 gene, which closely resembled VH1-2. We in-
tegrated our CH235-lineage findings with a second
broadly neutralizing lineage and HIV-1 co-evolution

 to suggest a vaccination strategy for inducing both
lineages.
INTRODUCTION
Understanding the pathways and mechanisms of broadly
neutralizing antibody (bnAb) induction is a critical goal of HIV-1
vaccine development (Bonsignori et al., 2012; Haynes, 2015;
Haynes and Bradley, 2015; Haynes et al., 2012; Mascola and
Haynes, 2013;). In chronic HIV-1 infections, breadth of plasma
neutralization follows a uniform distribution and broad neutrali-
zation arises in �50% of individuals after 5 years or more of
infection (Hraber et al., 2014). The delayed appearance of bnAbs
suggests roadblocks to their development, and one vaccine
approach is to decipher these roadblocks and devise strategies
to overcome them. It is possible that—because of the high diver-
sity of antibodies resulting from recombination and somatic hy-
permutation (SHM)—different bnAb lineages may have different
developmental pathways and roadblocks. However, for the
CD4-binding site (CD4bs), a population-level analysis on 14 do-
nors indicated only two general types of CD4bs bnAbs: VH-gene-
restricted and CDR H3-dominated (Zhou et al., 2015).
The VH-gene-restricted classes arise from two highly similar
VH-genes: VH1-2 and VH1-46 (Scheid et al., 2011; Wu et al.,
2011). VH1-2*02 and VH1-46*01 share 93.4% (269/288) nucleo-
tide sequence identity. Both classes give rise to antibodies that
recognize the CD4bs via VH structural mimicry of the immuno-
globulin-like N-terminal domain of CD4 (Zhou et al., 2010,
2015). For the VH1-2 gene-derived antibodies, analysis of their
ontogeny suggests two roadblocks based on: (1) a requirement
for high levels of SHM (Klein et al., 2013; Scheid et al., 2009,
2011; Wu et al., 2010), and (2) weak binding of the inferred unmu-
tated common ancestor (UCA) to gp120 (Jardine et al., 2013;
McGuire et al., 2013; Scheid et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011; Zhou
et al., 2010, 2015), although a definitive analysis from time-of-
infection had not yet provided detail. In addition, several of the
CD4bs bnAbs are autoreactive with ubiquitinase enzymes (Bon-
signori et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015).
Structure-based design of UCA-interacting immunogens has
recently demonstrated a means to overcome this second road-
block, with priming of VH1-2 bnAb lineages in knock-in mice
(Dosenovic et al., 2015; Jardine et al., 2015). However, the matu-
ration of primed VH1-2 CD4bs B cell lineages to broad neutraliza-
tion as well as the mechanism for the development of breadth
remain unresolved.
For the VH1-46-derived antibodies, far less is known. Two
chronically HIV-infected individuals, RU1 and RU8, have devel-
oped VH1-46-derived bnAbs, 1B2530 and 8ANC131 (Scheid
et al., 2011). We recently described an African individual (donor
CH505) who, over time, developed a CD4bs bnAb lineage (the
CH103 lineage) that recognized the CD4 supersite through a
CDR H3-dominated mode of interaction (Liao et al., 2013). Anal-
ysis of the co-evolution between virus and CH103 lineage
demonstrated a second B cell lineage (the CH235 lineage) that
cooperated by selection of escape mutants from the CH235 line-
age that drove the CH103 bnAb lineage (Gao et al., 2014). Here,
we find that the CH235 lineage itself progressed to bnAb over 5
years of affinity maturation. We identify sequences of the CH235
lineage through longitudinal samples of 17 time points spanning
weeks 6–323 post infection, assess neutralization breadth of
sequential lineage members on a panel of �200 diverse isolates,
and determine Env-complexed crystal and EM structures for
lineage members. We analyze the conformity (i.e., the level of
shared mutation positions and identical sequence mutations)
of CH235 lineage development relative to other VH gene-specific
bnAb lineages in other donors, as well as the co-evolution of vi-
rus and CH235 lineage. Despite an early near-optimal binding
orientation, the CH235 lineage required over 20% SHM to reach
90% neutralization breadth. Our results provide insight into
the difficulties in focusing recognition to the conserved CD4
site of HIV-1 vulnerability and suggest that CD4bs-directed anti-
bodies, whether VH-gene-restricted or CDR H3-dominated, face
similar obstacles in development. For VH1-46- and VH1-2-
derived CD4-mimic antibodies, the unique genetic mutability
inherent in each of these two VH-germline genes helps to direct
maturation, potentially providing an explanation for the preva-
lence of effective CD4bs antibodies derived from these two
germline genes.
RESULTS
Sequencing of B Cell Antibody Gene Rearrangements in
Longitudinal Samples
To understand the maturation of the cooperating CH235 lineage
in donor CH505, we sought to identify sequences of lineage
members at 17 time points, spanning weeks 6–323 from time
of infection. We first asked when we could detect members of
the CH235 lineage. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of anti-
body heavy chain gene rearrangements amplified from genomic
DNA template of blood mononuclear cells from week 6 to 152 (15
time points) identified a total of 479,028 unique, non-duplicated
V-heavy sequences. The first V-heavy sequences belonging to
the CH235 B cell lineage were found at week 14, and additional
CH235 lineage members were found at all subsequent time
points. Only unique sequences in the CH235 lineage were further
investigated and they were assigned to the earliest time point
(time-of-appearance) in which they were identified. Four V-heavy
sequences were paired with the closest VL from isolated anti-
bodies and produced as recombinant monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) (CH235.6–CH235.9). From cultured memory B cells
collected 41 weeks post-transmission, we had previously iso-
lated five members of the CH235 lineage (CH235, CH236,
CH239, CH240, and CH241) (Gao et al., 2014), and we have
now isolated four additional members with natural VH and VL
pairing from cultured memory B cells collected at weeks 264
and 323 post-transmission: CH235.10–CH235.13 (Figures 1A
and S1A; Table S1). CH235 lineage antibodies represented
0.018% of the total memory B cell repertoire and 0.5% of the
CH505 TF gp120-specific memory B cell population.
The CH235 lineage could be separated into three clades
(clade I, II, and III). Clade I showed a number of early lineage
members, but no additional clade I sequences were observed
after week 30; clade II showed further development and included
members CH241 (week 41) and CH235.6 (week 66), but no
additional sequences were observed after week 66; clade III

 developed through week 323 and included antibodies CH235
(week 41), CH235.9 (week 152), and CH235.12 (week 323)
(Figure 1A).
CH235 Lineage HIV-1 Neutralization
To characterize the development of neutralization breadth in
the CH235 lineage, we assessed antibodies in clade III for their
ability to neutralize diverse HIV-1 isolates in a 199-isolate panel
(Figure 1B; Table S2). No isolates were neutralized by the
unmutated common ancestor (UCA), whereas 18% of the vi-
ruses were neutralized by CH235 at week 41. By week 152,
CH235.9 neutralized 77% of viruses, although with a relatively
weak potency of 3 mg/ml. By week 323, however, CH235.12
was able to neutralize 90% of viruses, and the neutralization
50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) potency increased by
5-fold to 0.6 mg/ml.
We next analyzed the heterologous neutralization pattern of
these antibodies to understand their development of broad
neutralization (Figure S1B) (Georgiev et al., 2013). CH235 lineage
members and previously identified HIV-1 bnAbs were clustered
based on heterologous neutralization activity. CH235 neutraliza-
tion activity was more similar to CD4bs bnAbs than to bnAbs with
other epitope specificities. While the CH235 neutralization profile
was the most divergent from other CD4bs bnAbs, CH235.9 and
CH235.12 were much more similar to other CD4bs bnAbs and
each other. Interestingly, despite VH1-46 usage, the CH235.9
and CH235.12 neutralizing profile was more similar to that of
VH1-2-derived antibodies, such as VRC01, than VH1-46-derived
antibodies, such as 8ANC131 (Figure S1B).
Crystal Structures of CH235-Lineage Members with
HIV-1 gp120
To provide structural insight into the recognition and maturation
of the CH235 lineage, we prepared the antigen-binding frag-
ments (Fabs) of antibodies CH235 (week 41 from time-of-infec-
tion, 18% breadth), CH235.9 (week 152, 77%), and CH235.12
(week 323, 90%), and co-crystallized, solved and refined
these in complex with the gp120 core of HIV-1 isolate strain

dues altered during SHM and observed changes throughout
the variable domain (Figure 2A).
Comparison of the orientation of the VH of CH235 in Env bind-
ing with that of CD4, VRC01, and 8ANC131 (Scheid et al., 2011)
showed that the CH235 VH domain mimicked CD4 in Env binding

 and was highly similar to the VH orientation and structure of the
VRC01 and 8ANC131 VH chains: in particular, the VH1-46 of
CH235 preserved key contacts mediated by the CDR H2 loop
for the CD4 binding loop and for the gp120 D368 (Figures S2A
and S2B).
Analysis of the angle of recognition for the CH235 lineage indi-
cated little change during maturation, with CH235, CH235.9, and
CH235.12 all clustering within the larger VRC01-class of anti-
bodies. Interestingly, other VH1-46 antibodies clustered differ-
ently, with antibody 1B2530 from HIV-1-positive donor RU1 at
a highly similar angle and 1.5 A
˚ translated, and antibodies
8ANC131 and 8ANC134 from HIV-1-positive donor RU8 occu-
pying a cluster �55� and 3.5 A
˚ translated related to the CD4
(Figure S2C).
These results suggest that the gp120-antibody orienta-
tion was determined early in bnAb lineage ontogeny, with
further maturation maintaining the same general orientation.
Overall, the structures of CH235 lineage members with
HIV-1 gp120 Env revealed CD4 mimicry. While the VH
gene usage classifies the CH235 lineage within the VH1-
46-derived 8ANC131 bnAb class, it is both functionally
and structurally closer to the VRC01 class (Zhou et al.,
2015).
Negative Stain EM of CH235-Lineage Members with
Trimeric HIV-1 Env
To visualize the recognition of the CH235 lineage in the
context of the HIV-1 Env trimer, we used negative stain EM
to determine 3D-reconstructions of Fabs CH235, CH235.9,
and CH235.12 bound to trimeric BG505 and B41 HIV-1 Env
glycoproteins (Figure 2B) (Pugach et al., 2015; Sanders
et al., 2013). Notably, the stoichiometry increased with anti-
body maturation, with CH235 (8% VH mutation) binding with
a stoichiometry of 1:1 (BG505; Figures 2B, top, and S2D–
S2F) or 2:1 (B41; Figures 2B, bottom, and S2D–S2F) Fabs
per trimer and CH235.9 and CH235.12 (19% and 25% VH mu-
tation, respectively) binding with a 3:1 Fab to trimer ratio (Fig-
ure 2B). We next compared the orientation and stoichiometry
of CH235.12 Fab with that of CH103, a CDR H3-dependent
CD4bs bnAb isolated from the same subject (Liao et al.,
2013). EM analysis of either CH235.12 or CH103 Fab in com-
plex with BG505 SOSIP.664 revealed structural differences
between the CDR H3-dominated CH103 class bnAb and the
8ANC131-class CH235.12 bnAb and, in accordance with crys-
tallographic results, the angle of approach of CH235 was
similar to that of VRC01 and other CD4 mimicking bnAbs
(Figure S2G).
Despite the CD4 mimicry by CH235, the trimer remained in a
closed conformation when the CH235 lineage members were
bound. However, the EM-derived model of CH103 in complex
with BG505 revealed that CH103 either bound to or induced a
more open version of the trimer. This conformation represents
an intermediate state between the closed, compact trimer in
complex with CH235 or VRC01 and the CD4-induced open
model in complex with soluble CD4 or 17b Fab (Figure S2G).
Similar to more mature CH235 lineage bnAb Fabs, bnAb
CH103 bound to BG505 with a stoichiometry of three Fabs per
trimer (Figure S2G).
Maturation Focuses CH235 Lineage Recognition to a
Conserved Site of CD4 Vulnerability
To gain insight into the structural consequences of maturation,
we mapped the epitope of CH235 lineage members relative to
the conformationally invariant CD4 supersite of vulnerability
(Zhou et al., 2015). When we mapped the CH235 footprint on
gp120, we observed portions of the CH235-binding surface on
gp120 to be outside of the CD4 supersite of vulnerability (Fig-
ure 2C, left). This surface was reduced in CH235.9 and
CH235.12 structures, especially on variable loop V5. Recogni-
tion by the CH235.12 antibody concentrated almost entirely on
the CD4 supersite of vulnerability, with little interactions with
the inner domain or variable loop V5; there was, however, a large
remaining interaction with the conserved loop D region (Fig-
ure 2C, middle and right).
To quantify targeting precision, we computed the buried sur-
face between antibodies and gp120 co-crystal complexes, for
the region overlapping the CD4 supersite of vulnerability minus
the region outside the vulnerable site. Overall targeting precision
correlated with neutralization breadth (p = 0.0007) (Figure 2D).
The CH235-lineage antibodies all showed good targeting preci-
sion. We also analyzed the correlation of SHM versus neutraliza-
tion breadth (p = 0.0097) (Figure 2E). While the CH235 lineage
generally trended toward lower SHM relative to neutralization
breadth, all CD4bs bnAbs appeared to require a high degree of
SHM, independent of whether the antibody derived from a spe-
cific VH-gene or used a CDR H3-dominated mode of recognition.
Overall, the results suggest that maturation requires a high de-
gree of SHM to focus recognition onto the CD4 supersite of
vulnerability, and this high degree of SHM is a general require-
ment of all CD4bs bnAb lineages, even those that begin with
highly favorable orientations such as CH235.
Conformity of Sequence Evolution of CH235 Lineage
The mutation levels of CH235-lineage antibodies isolated
41 weeks post infection from memory B cell cultures was mark-
edly lower (range 7%–11%;) than that of all previously reported
VH1-46 and VH1-2 CD4bs bnAbs (> 25%) (Scheid et al., 2011;
Sui et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2015) (Table S1).
The mutation levels of CH235-lineage antibodies isolated up to
264 weeks post infection increased to �20%, but were still lower
than those of most other bnAbs until 323 weeks post infection
(CH235.12: 26% mutations) (Figure 3A).
To quantify the conformity of CH235-lineage antibodies to
the two VH1-46-derived bnAbs (1B2530 from donor RU1 and
8ANC131 from donor RU8) (Scheid et al., 2011; Zhou et al.,
2015), we analyzed the similarity of shared mutation positions
(positional conformity) and shared identical mutations (identity
conformity) of the VH genes (Figures 3B and S3A). As a compar-
ison, we also calculated the positional conformity and identity
conformity of non-HIV-1 targeting antibodies isolated from 3
HIV-1 negative donors relative to template antibodies 1B2530
and 8ANC131. Positional conformity in SHM was spread over
a large range (50%–90%), and there did not seem to be
much discrimination between VH1-46 in antibodies that effec-
tively neutralized HIV-1 and those that did not (Figure 3B, top
panels). Identity conformity in SHM was also spread over a large
range (0%–75%) (Figure 3B, bottom panels), and while little

(B) Maturation conformity versus overall heavy chain SHM. Positional conformity (top row) is defined as the number of aa positions differing from the germline
sequence in both the conforming and reference sequences, divided by the total number of aa changes in the conforming antibody. Identity conformity (bottom
row) is defined as the number of such positions that are additionally mutated to the same residue, divided by the total number of mutations in the conforming
antibody. Conformity to 1B2530 (left) and to 8ANC131 (right) is shown for both position and identity.
(C) VH-gene mutability accounts for the majority of positional conformity of CH235 lineage. The mutability of the VH-gene for VH1-46 (top) and VH1-2 (bottom) is
shown. Sequence logos are shown at each position; the height of each logo corresponds to the percent of mutated reads. Green bars are shown for SHM in
antibody CH235, which are altered in over a quarter of VH1-46-derived antibodies.

 discrimination was observed between VH1-46 in antibodies that
effectively neutralized HIV-1 and those that did not for antibody
8ANC131, there was discrimination among CD4bs antibodies
when 1B2530 was used as a reference (Figure 3B, bottom left
panel). The differences in CH235-lineage identify conformity to
1B2530 or to 8ANC131 may reflect the greater similarity of the
recognition orientation of CH235-lineage members with1B2530
(Figure S2C) and suggested that slight differences in recognition
orientation can substantially alter factors associated with identity
conformity.
Overall, these results indicated SHM in response to HIV-1 infec-
tion to proceed in a manner that depended less on functional
selection and more on intrinsic properties of the VH1-46-gene,
especially related to the position of residues that undergo SHM.
To investigate further the contribution of the VH1-46 gene, we
analyzed SHM observed in VH1-46 gene transcripts from three un-
infected individuals (Figure 3C, top); notably, all 11 positions
mutated in CH235, 1B2530 and 8ANC131 were also mutated
among non-HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies with high frequency
(R20%). Moreover, the residue substitutions in CH235 were
frequently found in the top three most commonly observed substi-
tutions for that position in the VH1-46 gene. To quantify the impact
of gene mutability, we compared the difference in probability dis-
tributions of positional and identity conformity for sequences
simulated with and without taking into account the intrinsic VH1-
46 gene mutability. The simulations showed that both positional
and identity conformity shifted to a higher level of similarity when
considering gene mutability (Figures S3B and S3C). Notably, a
substantial shift in probability was observed for the positional con-
formity of CH235 (Figure S3B; Table S4A). Similar shifts in identity
conformity were also observed for CH235 (Figure S3C; Table
S4B). Thus, the intrinsic susceptibility at specific sites of the
VH1-46 germline gene to mutation as well as to the frequency of
specific mutations that existed at each of these sites appeared
tobe adominantfactorinthe SHMalteration ofthe CH235 lineage.
These resultsare inlinewithour previousfindingthat selection and
mutability synergizedduring affinity maturation ofan influenza HA-
reactive clone from a non-HIV-1 infected person to hemagglutinin
(HA) (Kepler et al., 2014). Hence, the dominant role of intrinsic sus-
ceptibility at specific sites may be a more general biological phe-
nomenon in dictating the course of SHM.
Because VH1-2 is genetically the most closely related germline
gene to VH1-46, we also examined the mutability of the VH1-2
gene (Figure 3C, bottom). Consistent with VH1-46 antibodies,
the mutated positions among VH1-2-derived bnAbs also showed
high frequency of mutation among non-HIV-1 targeting VH1-2
antibodies, suggesting that gene mutability contributes to VH1-
2-derived HIV-1 antibody evolution. Notably, the average muta-
bility of the VH1-2 gene at positions where the CH235 antibody
showed SHM was generally high: 9 of 15 positions mutated in
CH235 antibody were also mutated in more than 15% of VH1-
2-derived NGS reads. In 10 of these 15 positions, the mature
VH1-2-derived bnAbs (VRC01, VRC-CH31, and VRC-PG04)
also showed changes. When we analyzed mutability of other
VH genes used by CD4bs bnAbs (VH1-69, VH3-23, VH3-30, and
VH4-59) (Zhou et al., 2015) (Figure S3D), we observed gene
mutability patterns different from that of VH1-46 while, in
contrast, the mutability patterns of VH1-2 and VH1-46 were
more similar (Table S4C). Despite the similarity between VH1-2
and VH1-46, we did observe that antibody sequences from
CD4bs bnAbs of each gene segregated phylogenetically (Fig-
ure S3E), indicating differences in maturation pathway between
bnAbs evolving from these two germline genes.
These data suggested that, for both VH1-2 and VH1-46 germ-
line genes-derived bnAbs, somatic mutations that led to neutral-
ization breadth appeared to be primarily determined by the
intrinsic mutability of VH1-46 and VH1-2 germline genes. The dif-
ferences in the intrinsic mutabilities of these VH genes may
contribute to the high occurrence of CD4bs bnAbs that originate
from either VH1-2 or VH1-46 (Zhou et al., 2015).
Interaction between CH235 and CH103 bnAb Lineages
While gene mutability plays a role in determining the position
where SHM occurs, binding between antibody and HIV-1 Env
likely also plays a role in selecting or fixing a mutation. A hallmark
of cooperating B cell lineages is that they interact at the same
site as the bnAb lineage that is being driven (Gao et al., 2014).
To determine a mechanism whereby the initial interaction of
the early CH235 and CH103 lineage members bind to the
same or similar epitope and result in CH235 selection of escape
mutants that stimulated the CH103 bnAb lineage (Gao et al.,
2014), we evaluated cross-competition between early CH235
lineage antibodies and the CH103 lineage antibody CH106 in
ELISA, as an example of early CH103 lineage development,
and measured their association rate constant with surface plas-
mon resonance (SPR). Since both the CH235 and CH103 line-
ages bound to the loop D gp120 region, we asked if the early
CH235 lineage antibodies could block the binding of the
CH103 lineage mature antibody CH106, or block the binding of
soluble (s)CD4 to CH505 TF gp120 Env. CH241 was the only
antibody in the CH235 lineage that strongly blocked CH106
bnAb and sCD4 binding to CH505 gp120 (IC50 = 2.6 and
1.5 mg/ml, respectively) (Table S5A).
To confirm early dominance of the binding of CH103 lineage
compared to the CH235 lineage to CH505 TF Env, we reversed
the blocking assay and asked if bnAb CH106 could block the
binding of biotinylated CH235, CH236, CH239, CH240 or
CH241. CH106 strongly blocked the binding of all the CH235
mature antibodies with IC50s ranging from 2.3 mg/ml (for
CH240) to 14.3 mg/ml (for CH241) (Table S5B). These data sug-
gested that the earliest maturation intermediates of the CH235
lineage antibodies could not outcompete CH106 bnAb for bind-
ing to CH505 TF gp120 Env.
Affinity maturation in germinal centers is subjected to kinetic
selection and involves improvement in dissociation rate constant
(Kd) that is often driven by an improvement in the kinetic associ-
ation rate (ka), which is a key variable in conferring a binding
advantage for the cognate epitope to an antibody over other
competing antibodies (Foote and Milstein, 1991; Kepler et al.,
2014). We measured the ka and dissociation kinetic rate (kd) of
the CH505 TF gp120 Env binding by CH235 and CH103 with
SPR to identify differences that might explain the relative inability
of the CH235 lineage to block the binding of the CH103 lineage
bnAbs to autologous CH505 TF Env and found that the two line-
ages followed two distinct trajectories and modalities to increase
their overall affinity.

 The UCA of the CH103 lineage bound to CH505 TF Env with a
Kd of 227 nM that increased one order of magnitude throughout
affinity maturation (Figure 4A). The CH103 UCA displayed a fast
association rate (ka = 37 3 103 M�1s�1) that was maintained
across the intermediate and mature mAbs (ka = 11.9 � 37.3 3
103 M�1s�1), suggesting that maintaining the fast association
rate was important for survival and maturation of the CH103
lineage (Figure 4B). In contrast, the CH235 lineage mAb Kd
increased four orders of magnitude during affinity maturation
(from 30.6 mM of IA4—the earliest intermediate mAb in the
CH235 lineage for which kinetic rates could be measured—to
0.7 nM of CH241) (Figure 4C). Such increase was predominantly
facilitated by slower dissociation rates (kd) observed in later
intermediates and mature mAbs, which decreased from 88.1 3
10�3s�1 of IA4 to 0.33 3 10�3s�1 of CH241 (Figure 4D).
Conversely, CH235 lineage mAbs bound to CH505 TF gp120
Env with ka that started off an order of magnitude slower than
CH103 UCA and its earlier intermediates (IA4 ka = 2.9 3 103
M�1s�1) and only modestly improved—primarily between IA1
and CH235 mAbs—with the majority of the early CH235 mAbs
having slower ka than CH103 mAbs (Figure 4D).
Thus, the relative inability of week 41 CH235 lineage anti-
bodies to block early mature CH103 lineage mAbs could be ex-
plained by the observed differences in their association rates,
and these data provide an explanation of how the CH235 anti-
body lineage exerted its cooperating function in driving autolo-
gous virus toward better neutralization by the CH103 antibody
lineage without impeding concurrent development of the
CH103 antibody lineage itself.
Late CH235 Lineage Broadly Neutralizing Antibodies
Neutralize Autologous Loop D Escape Viruses Selected
by Early CH235 Lineage Members
We have previously demonstrated that the CH235 lineage
selected escape viruses with mutations in the loop D region of
gp120 Env that rendered loop D mutant viruses more sensitive
to the CH103 bnAb lineage and that autologous virus escaped
from early CH235 lineage antibodies by week 30 after infection
(Gao et al., 2014). We have now isolated autologous viruses
through week 323 and determined the neutralization capacity
of the late CH235 lineage bnAbs. Viruses partially sensitive to
the later members of the CH235 lineage (particularly bnAbs
CH235.9 and CH235.12) were found as late as week 176 (Fig-
ure 5A; Table S6). These viruses still contained the loop D muta-
tions that were selected by virus escape from early antibody
members of the CH235 lineage (Gao et al., 2014). Hence, we
tested the ability of the late CH235 lineage bnAbs to neutralize
the panel of CH505 TF loop D mutants (Gao et al., 2014).
Remarkably, CH235.9, CH235.12, and CH235.13 bnAbs ac-
quired the ability to neutralize all loop D mutants that were resis-
tant to the early members of the CH235 lineage (Figure 5B; Table
S7). In particular, CH235.9, CH235.12, and CH235.13 neutral-
ized CH505 TF gp120 M8, M20, and M21 (not neutralized by
early lineage member CH236), which differed from CH505 TF
gp120 M6 and M10 (neutralized by CH236) by a single mutation
at position 280 (N280S for M8 and M20 and N280T for M21)
(Figure 5B).
In the gp120-complexed structure, the side chains of N280
forms three hydrogen bonds with two residues in the CDR L3,
and these hydrogen bonds are predicted to be disrupted by
the N280S and N280T mutations (Figure S4A). Since the
CH235.9 antibody had the VL of CH236, the direct implication
was that mutations in the heavy chain were responsible for the
ability of CH235.9 to neutralize loop D mutant viruses. Interest-
ingly, CH235.7, which did not neutralize autologous viruses
beyond week 53, also had the VL of CH236 but, in contrast to
CH235.9, failed to neutralize CH236-resistant loop D mutants
M7, M8, M9, M20, and M21.
Therefore, we reverted the five amino acids (aa) in CH235.9 VH
at gp120 contact positions that were different from those present
in CH236 VH but not shared with CH235.7 VH: N30T and D31T in
CDR H1, G62Q and G65Q in FR H3, and A103E in CDR H3 (Fig-
ure S4B). Five of the six CH235.9 mutants retained the ability to
potently neutralize all the CH505 TF loop D mutant viruses. In
contrast, the N30T mutation in CDR H1 reverted CH235.9 to
the CH236 phenotype (CH236 has a threonine in position 30):
M21 neutralization was abrogated, M20, M7, and M9 were
near completely abrogated (CH235.9 N30T IC50 > 44 mg/ml),
and M8 IC50 increased 37-fold (CH235.9 IC50 = 0.66 mg/ml
versus CH235.9 N30T IC50 = 24.31 mg/ml) (Table S7).

 Thus, acquisition of extraordinary breadth in the CH235 bnAb
lineage was associated with accumulation of somatic mutations
inCDRH1thatenabledlateCH235lineageantibodiestoneutralize
autologous loop D mutant viruses that were escape mutants from
early CH235 antibodies. CH235.9 bnAb residue N30 contacts
R429 in the b20-b21 loop of the C4 region of gp120 Env, which
is on the opposite face of the CD4bs from loop D (Figure 5C). In
addition, CH505 TF has a glutamic acid in position 429 that is in
close enough proximity to N30 to form a hydrogen bond.
These findings indicate a mechanism for acquiring the ability
to neutralize loop D mutants via a compensatory mutation in

Envs from viruses that were also neutral-

binding to the initial members of the
CH103 lineage (Hraber et al., 2015) and have now performed
the same Env binding analysis of the CH103 lineage with ten
additional matured bnAb members of the CH103 lineage (Fig-
ure 6A; Table S8). We have used these data to select CH505
gp120 Env quasi-species that bound to mature and precursor
bnAbs of both lineages, defining a series of CH505 Env immuno-
gens now optimized and predicted to induce both bnAb lineages
(Figure S5A).

acted with CH505 TF gp120 at �10 mM as determined by SPR

in ELISA (Figure 6A; Table S8). Moreover, in a panel of 15 heter-
ologous Envs from multiple clades, CH235 UCA bound to 3/15
Envs and the introduction of only three mutations (W47L,
G54W, and S56R), which were selected based on the increase
in surface area of interaction (G54W and S56R) or the reduction
in clash score (W47L), increased this recognition (to 5/15 Envs),
of which the dominant effect appeared to be reduction in clash
(Figures 6B and S5B).
Autoreactivity in the CH235 B Cell Lineage
Development of auto- and polyreactivity during antibody matura-
tion toward neutralization breadth is a critical aspect that may
limit the ability of generating bnAbs during natural infection and
upon vaccination (Bonsignori et al., 2014; Haynes et al., 2005,
2012; Haynes and Verkoczy, 2014; Liu et al., 2015; Verkoczy
et al., 2010, 2011, 2013). We had previously reported that in
HIV-1-infected individual CH505, the CD4bs CH103 bnAb line-
age was polyreactive and, similar to VRC01-class bnAbs, bound
to human ubiquitin ligase E3A (UBE3A) with avidity correlated
with neutralization (Liao et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015). In addition,
most of the mutations introduced in VRC07—a somatic variant of
VRC01—that enhanced neutralizing activity also resulted in
increased autoreactivity (Rudicell et al., 2014). Since CH235.12
is a potent and extremely broad CD4-mimic CD4bs bnAb, we
compared the auto- and polyreactivity profile of CH235.12
with other members of the CH235 lineage. Most CH235 lineage
antibodies displayed reactivity against DNA and sporadic
reactivity with Scl70 (CH235.7) (Figure 7A). CH241 bound to car-
diolipin (Figure 7B). In Hep-2 IF staining CH236, CH235.7 and
CH235.9 were all cytoplasmic positive (Figure 7C). Conversely,
CH235.12, despite being highly mutated and broadly neutral-
izing, did not display autoreactivity in any of these assays (Figures
7A–7C) Of particular note, CH235 lineage antibodies, including
CH235.12, did not react with UBE3A (Figure 7D).
These data identify CH235.12 as an antibody that has devel-
oped neutralization breadth without being itself auto- and poly-
reactive, while less mutated precursor antibodies (CH235 is in
the same clade of CH235.12) did develop autoreactivity. We
conclude that in vivo decoupling of neutralization breadth of
CD4 mimic CD4bs bnAbs from auto- and polyreactivity can
occur, even for bnAb lineages that have developed autoreactivity
during the course of their maturation and, therefore, inducing
such bnAbs from such lineages through vaccination, although
difficult, is an achievable goal.
DISCUSSION
Here, we have traced the ontogeny of the CH235 VH1-46
8ANC131 class of CD4bs bnAbs from acute infection to chronic
infection and defined both the structural and functional pathways
of bnAb lineage induction. That the CH235 bnAb lineage that
selected virus escape mutants that drove the CH103 CD4bs
CDR H3-dependent bnAb lineage is itself an 8ANC131-class
bnAb lineage and co-evolved with the CH103 bnAb is a remark-
able demonstration of a bnAb-to virus-to bnAb interaction in the
same HIV-1 infected individual. In addition, the similarity of VH1-
46 8ANC131-like and VH1-2 VRC01 family CD4 supersite bnAbs
demonstrates dramatic convergence of antibody structures to
recognize the CD4 supersite. The CH235 lineage required over
20% SHM in heavy chain variable domain to achieve 90%
breadth. Fortunately, a substantial portion of the VH-gene SHM
was guided by the intrinsic mutability of the VH1-46 germline
gene. Moreover, the CH235 lineage Ab that became broadly
neutralizing acquired the ability to neutralize loop D mutants
selected by early Ab lineage members (Gao et al., 2014) with a
mechanism involving a compensatory mutation (T30N) in CDR
H1, which allowed the formation of H-bonds with the HIV-1
gp120 C4 region, thus correcting the original loss of binding.
The driving forces of the CH235 lineage were the natural
transmitted/founder and M5 Envs. In addition, despite near-
complete autologous virus escape from CH235 lineage anti-
bodies by week 100, viruses arose later during the course of
infection, which were sensitive to the more mature CH235
bnAb members and likely contributed to antigen drive. It is
interesting to note that many of these late viruses were less
sensitive to CH103 CDR H3 binder bnAbs prompting the
hypothesis that the CH103 lineage may have the capacity for
cooperation with the CH235 lineage after 5–6 years of co-
development. Finally, the CH235.12 antibody that evolved late
in CH235 development is an extraordinary broad and potent
non-autoreactive antibody and is a candidate for preventive
and therapeutic uses.
In summary, the acquisition of neutralization breadth in the
CH235 VRC01-like VH1-46 CD4 mimic bnAb occurred with
the sequence of transmitted/founder and early mutant-initiated
antigen drive, selection of Env loop D mutants that cooperated
with the CH103 bnAb lineage to drive it to bnAb breadth, fol-
lowed by acquisition of the ability of the CH235 lineage itself
to neutralize autologous loop D mutants coincident with potent
neutralization of a broad array of heterologous HIV-1 isolates.
Mapping these events points to a strategy for the simultaneous
induction of both CDR H3 and VRC01-class CD4bs bnAbs,
whereby sequential immunizations with transmitted founder
Env followed by loop D mutant Envs comprise a rational immu-
nization strategy.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Donor and Sample Information
Donor and sample information was previously reported (Liao et al., 2013) and is
summarized in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. Memory B cell
cultures were performed on PBMCs collected at 264 and 323 weeks post-
transmission. All work related to human subjects was in compliance with
Institutional Review Board protocols approved by the Duke University Health
System Institutional Review Board.
