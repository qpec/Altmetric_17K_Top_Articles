Research suggests that positive intergenerational contact can improve young people’s
attitudes towards older adults. However, today’s age-segregated society may not provide
ample opportunities for positive contact between younger and older adults to occur on a
regular basis. In three studies, we investigated whether the positive attitudinal outcomes
associated with direct contact might also stem from a more indirect form of
intergenerational relationship: extended contact. In Study 1 (N = 70), extended contact
was associated with more positive attitudes towards older adults even when controlling
for direct intergenerational contact (contact frequency and contact quality). In Study 2
(N = 110), the positive effects of direct and extended contact on young people’s age-
related attitudes were mediated by reductions in intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety.
The mediational effects of intergroup anxiety were replicated in Study 3 (N = 95) and
ingroup norms additionally emerged as a mediator of the positive effects of extended
contact on young people’s attitudes towards older adults. Discussion focuses on the
implications for strategies aimed at tackling ageism.
Demographic ageing is a recent social phenomenon in most developed countries
(Kinsella & He, 2009). Medical advancements and improvements in health care and living
standards mean that people are living longer than in previous generations, and this trend is
set to accelerate over the next 30–40 years (Kinsella & He, 2009). In the United States
(US), the number of people aged 65 or over is expected to increase over the next three
decades from 35.9 million (13% of the population) to nearly 70 million (20% of the
population). Similar increases in the number of older adults are expected in most
developed nations (Kinsella & He, 2009). Reflecting this historically unprecedented
demographic shift, a United Nations (2007) report estimated that by 2,047 the number of
older people worldwide would outstrip the number of young people for the first time.
While longer life expectancies are a positive outcome, the expanding older population
may face challenges such as increased negative attitudes towards older people (Nelson,
2005; North & Fiske, 2012). In a US survey, nearly 80% of respondents aged 60 years or
over reported having been discriminated against due to their age (Palmore, 2001), and a
European survey found that ageism was the most commonly experienced type of
discrimination, ahead of discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, disability, religion or

 sexual orientation (Abrams, Eilola, & Swift, 2009). Given the prevalence of ageism and the
rapidly ageing population, there is an urgent need to understand factors that lead to the
development of age-related attitudes in young people, so that it may be possible to reduce
ageism.
The present research used contact theory (Allport, 1954) as a framework to examine
young people’s attitudes towards older adults. We conducted three studies to investigate
the relationships between young people’s age-related attitudes and their prior contact
with older adults. The aim is to investigate whether the positive attitudinal outcomes
associated with direct intergenerational contact might also stem from a more indirect
form of intergenerational relationship: extended contact (Wright, Aron, McLaughlin-
Volpe, & Ropp, 1997).
Intergenerational contact and attitudes towards older people
The contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954) maintains that contact with outgroup members
can, under certain conditions, reduce prejudice. Allport (1954) proposed that intergroup
attitudes would be improved when individuals from opposing groups are united within
contexts that allow both parties equal status, where they cooperate on tasks with
common goals, and have the support of relevant institutions and authorities that create
norms of acceptance. However, a meta-analysis of over 500 laboratory and field studies
(Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006) found that while these prerequisite conditions enhanced the
prejudice-reducing effects of contact, they were not essential, and contact alone reduced
prejudice.
The majority of contact studies have focused on intercultural contact (e.g., contact
based on racial or ethnic group memberships: for a review, see Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006).
However, contact is also effective at reducing ageism (e.g., Allan & Johnson, 2009; Caspi,
1984; Meshel & McGlynn, 2004). Caspi (1984) found that children experiencing daily
contact with older adults at preschool expressed more positive attitudes towards older
people generally and could discern more differences in the ages of older individuals, as
compared to children who had no such contact. Likewise, Allan and Johnson (2009) found
that young people who regularly interacted with older adults at work expressed more
positive attitudes towards older people as a whole, whereas those living with older
relatives had more ageist attitudes. Allan and Johnson suggested this could be attributed to
differences in the quality of contact experienced at work compared to contact with older
relatives at home: contact at work is likely to be with competent older individuals,
whereas contact at home is more likely to be with dependent older adults.
The importance of investigating not only the frequency of intergenerational contact
but also its quality has been highlighted in several studies (e.g., Bousfield & Hutchison,
2010; Hutchison, Fox, Laas, Matharu, & Urzi, 2010; Schwartz & Simmons, 2001). For
example, Schwartz and Simmons (2001) found no relationship between the frequency of
intergenerational contact and age-related attitudes in a sample of college students,
whereas those reporting good quality contact had less ageist attitudes. Bousfield and
Hutchison (2010) reported similar findings in a survey of university students and
additionally found that good quality contact was associated with more positive
behavioural intentions towards older adults. This included intentions to spend more
time with older adults, help them, and make donations to charities for older people.
While these examples suggest that intergenerational contact can reduce ageism in
young people, today’s age-segregated society may not provide ample opportunities for
positive and meaningful contact between younger and older individuals to occur on a
Intergenerational contact and ageism
523
 regular basis (Hagestad & Uhlenberg, 2005). Despite there being more older adults today
than at any point in history, changes in moral and political values along with family
breakdowns and advances in social media technology mean that people interact primarily
with same-age peers from an early age (Peacock & Talley, 1984). Likewise, social norms
discouraging intergenerational relationships may reduce the willingness of both young
and older individuals to interact with members of different age groups (Nelson, 2005).
Reflecting this, a survey of over 2000 British people confirmed that less than one-third of
over 70-year-olds had a friend under the age of 30 and less than one-third of under 30-year-
olds had a friend over the age of 70 (Abrams et al., 2009). These examples suggest the
existence of an increasingly age-segregated society, which provides the potential for
intergenerational misunderstandings leading to the development of ageist attitudes
(Abrams et al., 2009).
A unique aspect of ageism that adds further complexity to prejudice reduction is that,
unlike other outgroups, young people will themselves become members of the older
generation. This pending group transition presents unique challenges as young adults
may harbour anxieties about their own ageing (Lasher & Faulkender, 1993) and more
generally about coming into contact with older adults (Bousfield & Hutchison, 2010;
Hutchison et al., 2010). This may go some way towards explaining why contact’s
reduction of ageism is typically smaller in magnitude than its reduction of other types of
prejudice (Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006). With these issues in mind, in the present research,
we investigated whether the positive attitudinal outcomes associated with direct
intergenerational contact might also arise from extended contact (Wright et al., 1997).
Extended contact
A relatively recent development in contact theory is the extended contact hypothesis
(Wright et al., 1997), which holds that knowing that other ingroup members have
positive relationships with outgroup members can promote more positive outgroup
attitudes. In the present context, this would mean that knowing that their same-age peers
have positive relationships with older individuals might be sufficient to improve young
people’s attitudes towards older adults as a whole.
Extended contact has been found to predict more positive attitudes towards a host of
stigmatized and marginalized groups (e.g., Eller, Abrams, & G�
omez, 2012; G�
omez, Tropp,
& Fern�
andez, 2011; Hutchison & Rosenthal, 2011; Wright et al., 1997), but the ability of
extended contact to reduce ageism has yet to be empirically established (see Christian,
Turner, Holt, Larkin, & Cotler, 2014; Paolini, Hewstone, & Cairns, 2007). The lack of
research in this area is surprising in the light of research suggesting that the generation gap
in many developed countries is as wide as it has been since the 1960s (Pew Research
Center, 2009) and opportunities for the formation of positive relationships between
young and older adults are becoming increasingly limited (Abrams et al., 2009). Extended
contact may be especially useful in the current social climate as it implies that direct
intergenerational relationships may not be essential for the positive outcomes associated
with contact to be realized.
Another advantage of extended contact is that it allows individuals to experience
intergroup relationships while avoiding the anxieties often associated with direct
intergroup encounters (Stephan & Stephan, 1985). It can also be useful in preparing
members of opposing groups for future direct contact (Eller et al., 2012). Thus, it seems
both worthwhile and timely to explore whether extended contact might have similar
positive outcomes in the context of young people’s attitudes towards older adults.

 Mediators of direct and extended contact
Having confirmed that direct and extended contact can reduce prejudice, recent research
has investigated mediating variables (for a review, see Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008). One
such variable is intergroup anxiety (Stephan & Stephan, 1985), which refers to the
negative affect often experienced during or in anticipation of intergroup encounters.
Individuals may worry that interactions with outgroup members will lead to rejection,
embarrassment or misunderstanding, influencing the development of prejudice (Plant &
Devine, 2003; Stephan & Stephan, 1985). Indeed, intergroup anxiety predicts a range of
undesirable outcomes including negative outgroup attitudes and avoidance of outgroup
members (e.g., Esses & Dovidio, 2002; Stephan, Diaz-Loving, & Duran, 2000).
Several studies have shown that good quality intergroup contact can reduce
intergroup anxiety and indirectly reduce different types of prejudice (for a review, see
Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008) including ageism (Bousfield & Hutchison, 2010; Hutchison
et al., 2010). For example, Bousfield and Hutchison (2010) found that good quality
contact with older adults reduced young people’s concerns about impending intergen-
erational encounters, which in turn improved their attitudes towards older adults as a
whole (see also Hutchison et al., 2010). However, the links between extended contact,
intergroup anxiety, and the age-related attitudes of young people have not yet been
explored.
Another form of anxiety associated with ageism is ageing anxiety, which Lasher and
Faulkender (1993, p. 247) defined as ‘the combined concern and anticipation of losses
centred around one’s own ageing process’. Thus, whereas intergroup anxiety arises due
to concerns about the anticipated outcomes of intergroup interactions, ageing anxiety is
thought to arise from concerns related to the negative aspects of one’s personal ageing.
This includes concerns about the anticipated loss of one’s independence, close friends
and relatives, physical and mental health and, ultimately, one’s very existence (Lasher &
Faulkender, 1993). Consequently, older adults may present a threat to young people by
reminding them of the inevitable consequences of their own ageing (Greenberg, Schimel,
& Martens, 2002). Greenberg et al. (2002) proposed that individuals cope with the
anxiety induced by such threats by denigrating entities that serve as reminders of their
own fate (see also Martens, Greenberg, Schimel, & Landau, 2004; Nelson, 2005).
Consistent with this reasoning, several studies have found a positive correlation between
ageing anxiety and ageism (Allan & Johnson, 2009; Allan, Johnson, & Emerson, 2014;
Boswell, 2012; Harris & Dollinger, 2001).
Research has shown that intergenerational contact can reduce ageing anxiety and
indirectly reduce ageism. Allan and colleagues (Allan & Johnson, 2009; Allan et al., 2014)
found that frequent intergenerational contact was associated with less ageism in young
people and this reduction in ageism was mediated by a decrease in ageing anxiety: the
more contact young people have with older adults, the less anxious they are about their
own ageing, and the less ageist they are. However, attempts to replicate these effects have
not always been successful (Bousfield & Hutchison, 2010; Hutchison et al., 2010). For
example, Bousfield and Hutchison (2010) found that reduced intergroup anxiety
mediated the positive effect of good quality intergenerational contact on young people’s
age-related attitudes but ageing anxiety did not. Thus, further tests of the potential of
intergenerational contact to reduce ageing anxiety and ageism are required.
As well as providing such a test the present research additionally examined the
relationship between extended contact and ageing anxiety for the first time. It is
conceivable that, like direct intergenerational contact, extended contact might help to
Intergenerational contact and ageism
525
 reduce some of the concerns that young people often have about their own ageing (e.g.,
Eshbaugh, Gross, & Satrom, 2010) and therefore indirectly reduce ageism.
A further variable that has been shown to mediate the positive effects of contact is
ingroup norms (e.g., Davies, Wright, Aron, & Comeau, 2013). Ingroup norms represent
the shared understandings among ingroup members about appropriate group-based
actions, thoughts, values, and beliefs (Cialdini, Kallgren, & Reno, 1991). Ingroup norms
are particularly important in extended contact situations and are an integral part of the
process (Wright et al., 1997). Knowing that ingroup members have positive relationships
with outgroup members can increase the acceptability of such relationships by making
them seem more widespread and familiar, thus indirectly reducing prejudice (e.g.,
Cameron, Rutland, Hossain, & Petley, 2011; De Tezanos-Pinto, Bratt, & Brown, 2010;
Turner, Hewstone, Voci, & Vonofakou, 2008). Along these lines, Turner et al. (2008)
found that extended contact between White British students and South Asians in the
United Kingdom was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes, and this
relationship was mediated by increased norms of positive intercultural relationships.
Similarly, Cameron et al. (2011) found that ingroup norms mediated the positive
influence of extended contact on British adolescents’ attitudes towards Asians. These
examples suggest that ingroup norms are important for young people (see also Schofield
& Eurich-Fulcer, 2001) and therefore may influence their inhibitions about, and ultimately
their attitudes towards, older adults. However, no research to date has assessed the role of
ingroup norms in intergenerational contact situations.
A final mediating variable investigated in the present research is self-disclosure, which
refers to the voluntary sharing of intimate or personal information (Miller, 2002). Self-
disclosure is integral to the formation and maintenance of positive interpersonal
relationships (Altman & Taylor, 1973; Reis & Shaver, 1988). Receiving intimate disclosure
increases interpersonal trust and liking of the discloser (Collins & Miller, 1994) and is
likely to be reciprocated, leading to mutual interpersonal attraction (Laurenceau, Barrett,
& Rovine, 2005).
Self-disclosure is also important for the development of positive intergroup relation-
ships and the reduction of prejudice (e.g., Dovidio et al., 1997; Ensari & Miller, 2002;
Turner, Hewstone, & Voci, 2007). For example, Ensari and Miller (2002) found that self-
disclosure by a typical outgroup member during a cooperative intergroup activity not only
improved liking of the discloser, but also improved attitudes towards the outgroup as a
whole. Similarly, Turner et al. (2007) found that the more interethnic friendships that
White British schoolchildren had, the less prejudiced they were, and this association was
mediated by an increased willingness to self-disclosure to an outgroup member. In the
same study, the positive relationship between extended contact and outgroup attitudes
was also explained by increased willingness to self-disclose to an outgroup member.
These findings confirm that self-disclosure is important for the development of positive
intergroup relationships in young people and prejudice reduction (Dovidio et al., 1997).
However, the role of self-disclosure in direct or extended intergenerational contact
situations has yet to be empirically established (but see Harwood, Hewstone, Paolini, &
Voci, 2005).
Overview of the present research
The present research used contact theory (Allport, 1954) as a framework to investigate
young people’s attitudes towards older adults. Study 1 examined the relationships
between the age-related attitudes of young people and three different types of
526

 intergenerational contact: contact frequency, contact quality, and extended contact.
Studies 2 and 3 developed the analysis to additionally investigate the psychological
mechanisms through which direct and extended contact reduce ageism.
STUDY 1
Method
Participants
Seventy students at a London university participated in the study. Thirty-eight were female
and 32 were male. Ages ranged from 17 to 25, with a mean age of 21.16 years (SD = 2.12).
Materials and procedure
Students were approached on a university campus and invited to take part in a study on
‘elderly people in modern society’. Those who agreed were handed a questionnaire
containing all instructions and measures, which were presented in the same order as
described below. It was explained to participants that the term ‘elderly’ referred to people
aged 65 years or over, while ‘contact’ was defined as ‘interactions with elderly individuals
– for example at work, socially, in the neighbourhood’.
Contact measures
Contact frequency was assessed by asking participants to indicate how often they had
contact with elderly individuals on a scale ranging from 1 (very rarely) to 5 (very often).
Contact quality was assessed by asking participants to rate the quality of their previous
intergenerational contact using three 5-point scales with endpoints labelled: unpleasant–
pleasant, voluntary–involuntary, and bad quality–good quality. The items were combined
(averaged) to form a single contact quality score (Cronbach’s a = .73). Extended contact
was assessed by asking participants to indicate how many of their close friends have
positive relationships with older adults on a scale ranging from 1 (none at all) to 5 (very
many). Items were scored such that higher scores indicate more contact frequency,
better quality contact, and more extended intergenerational relationships, respectively.
Attitude measure
Participants indicated their attitudes towards older adults using six 5-point scales with
endpoints labelled: warm–cold, negative–positive, friendly–hostile, suspicious–trusting,
respect–contempt, and admiration–disgust (adapted from Wright et al., 1997). Partici-
pants were informed that their responses should reflect their feelings about older adults in
general, not those with whom they or their close friends have contact. Responses were
scored such that higher scores indicate a more positive attitude (a = .89).
Results
Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for the measures as well as their
intercorrelations. As shown in that table, both contact quality and extended contact were
positively correlated with young people’s attitudes towards older adults, whereas contact
frequency and attitudes were not correlated. Although not indicated in Table 1, gender or

 age of the participants were not correlated with any other variables, all rs < �.19, all
ps > .12.
Next, we conducted a multiple linear regression analysis to assess the extent to which
the three contact variables predict attitudes (see Table 2). Gender and age were included
as control variables. The regression equation was significant, F (5, 64) = 5.18, p < .001,
R2 = .29. Replicating the correlation results, both contact quality, B = .39, SE = .11,
t = 3.67, p < .001, and extended contact, B = .38, SE = .11, t = 3.59, p = .001, were
positively associated with attitudes, whereas contact frequency was not significantly
associated with attitudes, B = .14, SE = .11, t = 1.25, p = .22.

 Discussion
Study 1 investigated the relationships between different types of intergenerational
contact and young people’s attitudes towards older adults. The results suggest that having
frequent contact with older adults may not be sufficient to reduce ageism. Instead, the
data suggest that it is the perceived quality of intergenerational contact that has the
potential to reduce ageism. Finding that contact quality is associated with less ageism but
contact frequency is not is consistent with previous studies (Bousfield & Hutchison, 2010;
Hutchison et al., 2010; Schwartz & Simmons, 2001). Extending previous research, the
present results additionally suggest that direct contact may not even be necessary to
reduce ageism: simply knowing that their same-age peers have positive intergenerational
relationships may be sufficient to improve young people’s attitudes towards older adults.
We conducted a second study to test the robustness of these effects and to additionally
examine intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety as potential mediators of the positive
associations between both direct and extended intergenerational contact and young
people’s attitudes towards older adults.
STUDY 2
Method
Participants
Participants were 110 psychology students at a London university. Sixty-eight were
female, 41 were male, and one participant did not indicate their gender. Ages ranged from
18 to 25 with a mean age of 21.21 years (SD = 2.12). None had participated in Study 1.
Materials and procedure
The study was conducted in a lecture hall as part of a scheduled teaching session. All
instructions and measures were presented in a questionnaire in the same order as

 described below. As in Study 1, it was explained to participants that the term ‘elderly’
referred to people aged 65 years or over and ‘contact’ referred to ‘time spent interacting
with elderly people’.
Contact measures
Contact frequency was assessed by asking participants to indicate how often they had
contact with elderly individuals on a scale ranging from 1 (very rarely) to 7 (very often).
Contact quality was assessed using three 7-point scales with the same endpoint labels as
used in Study 1 (a = .71). Extended contact was assessed by asking participants to
indicate how many of their close friends had positive relationships with older adults on a
scale ranging from 1 (none at all) to 7 (very many). Responses were scored such that
higher values indicate more contact frequency, better quality contact, and more extended
contact, respectively.
Intergroup anxiety measure
Intergroup anxiety was assessed by asking participants how they would feel interacting
with a typical elderly person using three pairs of bipolar adjectives separated by a 7-point
scale. The adjective pairs were as follows: tense–relaxed, calm–nervous, and stressed–
unstressed. Participants were informed that their responses should reflect their feelings
about interacting with a typical older adult and not necessarily those older individuals
with whom they have contact. A similar measure has been used in several previous studies
(e.g., Bousfield & Hutchison, 2010). Responses were scored such that higher scores
indicate more intergroup anxiety (a = .78).
Ageing anxiety measure
Ageing anxiety was assessed using four items asking participants how they feel about
personally ageing: ‘I am worried that I will lose my independence when I am old’, ‘I am
relaxed about getting old’, ‘I am concerned that my mental abilities will suffer when I am
old’, and ‘I do not want to get old because it means I am closer to dying’. These items were
adapted from measures used in previous research (e.g., Lasher & Faulkender, 1993).
Responses were recorded on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree).
Higher scores indicate more ageing anxiety (a = .91).
Attitude measure
Participants indicated their attitudes towards older people on the same six pairs of bipolar
adjectives as used in Study 1 using a 7-point scale. The items were scored such that a higher
score indicates a more positive attitude (a = .81).
Results
Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for the measures along with their
intercorrelations. As in Study 1, both contact quality and extended contact were positively
correlated with young people’s attitudes towards older adults, whereas contact frequency
and attitudes were not significantly correlated. Likewise, both contact quality and
530
Lisbeth Drury et al.
 extended contact were negatively correlated with intergroup anxiety, but contact
frequency was not. All three contact variables were negatively correlated with ageing
anxiety, and both intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety were negatively correlated with
attitudes. Although not indicated in Table 1, gender or age was not correlated with any of
the other variables, all rs < .18, ps > .11.
As in Study 1, we used multiple regression analysis (see Table 2) to assess the extent to
which the three contact variables predict attitudes (controlling for gender and age). The
regression equation was significant F (5,102) = 6.26, p < .001. Replicating the results
from Study 1, contact quality, B = .35, SE = .01, t = 3.83, p < .001, and extended
contact, B = .31, SE = .01, t = 3.27, p = .001, were positively associated with attitudes,
whereas contact frequency was not associated with attitudes, B = �.04, SE = .10,
t = �0.44, p = .66.
Mediation analyses
We followed the procedures outlined by Preacher and Hayes (2008) to assess whether
intergroup anxiety and/or ageing anxiety mediated the positive association between
intergenerational contact (contact quality and extended contact) and young people’s age-
related attitudes. To this end, we used the Indirect Macro for SPSS (Preacher & Hayes,
2008), which uses bootstrapping techniques to estimate the total and direct effects of a
predictor variable on an outcome variable as well as the indirect effects through one or
more mediator variables. These analyses have the advantage of greater statistical power
without assuming multivariate normality in the sampling distribution and are more
appropriate than alternative techniques (e.g., structural equation modelling) when the
sample size is relatively small (Hayes, 2013). In these analyses, an indirect effect (PE) is
significant if the bias-corrected 95% confidence interval (BC CI) does not include zero.
Mediation of the contact quality – attitudes relationship
In this analysis, intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety were investigated as mediators of
the association between contact quality and attitudes. As well as gender and age, contact
frequency and extended contact were included in the model as covariates. The total effect
of contact quality on attitudes was significant, B = .35, SE = .09, t = 3.82, p < .001, as
was the direct effect, B = .23, SE = .09, t = 2.46, p = .02. The total indirect effect
through intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety was significant, PE = .12, SE = .06, BC CI
[.026, .263], as were the specific indirect effects through intergroup anxiety, PE = .06,
SE = .04, BC CI [.007, .179], and ageing anxiety, PE = .06, SE = .04, BC CI [.004, .175].
This confirms that intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety both mediate between contact
quality and young people’s attitudes towards older adults.
Mediation of the extended contact – attitudes relationship
In this analysis, intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety were investigated as mediators of
the association between extended contact and attitudes. Contact frequency, contact
quality, age, and gender were included as covariates. The total effect of extended contact
was significant, B = .31, SE = .09, t = 3.27, p = .002, but the direct effect was not,
B = .16, SE = .09, t = 1.64, p = .10. The total indirect effect through the two anxiety
variables was significant, PE = .15, SE = .07, BC CI [.039, .326], as were the specific
indirect effects through intergroup anxiety, PE = .07, SE = .04, BC CI [.014, .192], and

 ageing anxiety, PE = .07, SE = .05, BC CI [.002, .204]. This confirms that intergroup
anxiety and ageing anxiety also mediate between extended contact and young people’s
age-related attitudes.
Discussion
Study 2 investigated the relationships between different types of intergenerational
contact and young people’s age-related attitudes and additionally examined intergroup
anxiety and ageing anxiety as potential mediators of contact’s reduction of ageism.
Finding that contact quality and extended contact were associated with more positive
attitudes towards older people, whereas contact frequency was not, is consistent with the
results from Study 1 and several prior studies (Bousfield & Hutchison; Hutchison et al.,
2010; Schwartz & Simmons, 2001). Extending previous research, the results from Study 2
additionally show that the positive effects of both contact quality and extended contact on
young people’s age-related attitudes are mediated by reduced intergroup anxiety and
ageing anxiety. This suggests that the effects of experiencing indirect intergenerational
relationships may be similar to those associated with experiencing good quality direct
contact with older individuals. More specifically, the results suggests that when young
people experience good quality personal contact with older adults or when they
experience positive indirect intergenerational relationships within their close social
environment, they feel less anxious about possible future intergenerational encounters
and their own ageing and thus are less ageist.
A limitation with Studies 1 and 2 concerns the samples used. Both studies were
conducted with student samples, and it is possible that students may have different
experiences of contact with older adults as compared to non-students, especially
since students are more likely to come into contact with competent older individuals
on a regular basis (e.g., professors, mature students). Thus, it is possible that students
and non-students may differ in terms of the quality of contact they experience with
older adults as well as the number and nature of indirect relationships they
may be aware of. For this reason, we conducted a third study with a more diverse
sample.
In addition, in Study 3, we replaced the single-item extended contact measure used in
Studies 1 and 2 with a multi-item measure that has been used in previous contact studies
(Turner et al., 2008). Finally, as well as intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety, in Study 3,
we additionally examined ingroup norms and self-disclosure as potential mediating
variables. These variables have been shown in previous research to mediate the positive
effects of direct and extended contact on outgroup attitudes (Davies et al., 2013; Turner
et al., 2007, 2008), but not in the context of intergenerational contact.
STUDY 3
Method
Participants
The sample consisted of 95 participants, 61 males and 34 females. Ages ranged from 18 to
30 years (M = 24.52, SD = 3.29). Participants were asked to indicate their current
primary occupation: 82% were in either full-time or part-time employment, and 18% were
students.

 Materials and procedure
Participants were recruited via Amazon’s Mechanical Turk online tool and received $0.40
for completing a survey on ‘friendships’. The terms ‘elderly’ and ‘contact’ were defined as
in Studies 1 and 2.
Contact measures
As in Study 2, contact frequency was assessed by asking participants to indicate how often
they had contact with elderly individuals on a scale ranging from 1 (very rarely) to 7 (very
often). Contact quality was assessed using three 7-point scales with the same endpoint
labels as used in Studies 1 and 2 (a = .65). Extended contact was assessed using four items
adapted from measures used in prior research (Turner et al., 2008): ‘How many of your
friends in your age group have friends who are elderly?’, ‘How many of your very best
friends in your age group have friends that are elderly?’, ‘How many of your family
members in your age group have friends who are elderly?’ (1 = none, 5 = over ten), and
‘How many people in your age group do you know who have friends who are elderly’
(1 = none, 5 = most). The items were combined to form a single extended contact score
(a = .82). Higher scores indicate more extended contact.
Anxiety measures
Intergroup anxiety (a = .86) and ageing anxiety (a = .80) were assessed using the same
measures as in Study 2. Higher scores indicate more intergroup anxiety and ageing
anxiety, respectively.
Ingroup norms
Ingroup norms was assessed using four items adapted from previous research (Turner
et al., 2008): ‘Most of your friends (in your age group) would consider it something
positive to have elderly people as friends’, ‘Most of your friends (in your age group) would
choose to have a friend who is elderly’, ‘People in your age group like elderly people’
(1 = totally disagree, 7 = totally agree), and ‘Do you think your friends in your age group
wouldbe happyto socialize with someonewho is elderly?’ (1 = not at all happy, 7 = very
happy). The items were combined to form a single ingroup norms score (a = .85). A
higher score indicates more positive ingroup norms about friendships with older adults.
Self-disclosure
Self-disclosure was assessed using four items that were also adapted from previous
research (Turner et al., 2007). Participants indicated how willing they would be to
disclose the following information to an elderly person on a scale ranging from 1
(definitely not) to 7 (definitely): ‘a self-relevant problem’, ‘an exciting secret’, ‘their
feelings’, and ‘personal information’. The items were averaged to create a single self-
disclosure score (a = .89), with higher scores indicating more willingness to self-disclose.
Attitude measure
Participants indicated their attitudes towards older people on the same six pairs of bipolar
adjectives as used in Studies 1 and 2 using a 7-point scale. A higher score indicates a more
positive attitude (a = .88).

 Results
Table 1 displays the means and standard deviations for the measures along with their
intercorrelations. As in Studies 1 and 2, contact quality and extended contact were
positively correlated with young people’s attitudes towards older people whereas contact
frequency was not. In addition, all three contact variables were negatively correlated with
intergroup anxiety but only contact quality and extended contact were negatively
associated with ageing anxiety. Similarly, contact quality and extended contact were
positively associated with ingroup norms about intergenerational relationships but contact
frequency was not, and all three contact variables were positively correlated with
willingness to self-disclose to an older adult. As expected, intergroup anxiety and ageing
anxiety were associated with more negative attitudes towards older adults, whereas ingroup
norms and self-disclosure were associated with more positive age-related attitudes. Finally,
although not included in Table 1, the demographic variables were not associated with any
of the other variables except age, which was positively correlated with contact quality,
r = .23, p = .026, and self-disclosure, r = .21, p = .039, all other rs < .18, all ps > .09.
As in Studies 1 and 2 we used multiple regression analysis (see Table 2) to assess the
extent to which the different types of contact predict young people’s age-related attitudes
(controlling for the demographic variables). The regression equation was significant,
F (6, 88) = 4.08, p = .001, R2 = .22. Contact quality was positively associated with
attitudes towards older adults, B = .39, SE = .11, t = 3.78, p < .001, whereas extended
contact, B = .14, SE = .12, t = 1.26, p < .211, and contact frequency were not associated
with attitudes, B = .02, SE = .11, t = 0.20, p = .843.
Mediation analysis
Following the procedures outlined in Study 2, we examined whether intergroup anxiety,
ageing anxiety, ingroup norms, and self-disclosure mediate between both contact quality
and extended contact and young people’s attitudes towards older adults.
Mediation of the contact quality – attitudes relationship
In this analysis, intergroup anxiety, ageing anxiety, ingroup norms, and self-disclosure were
investigated as mediators of the positive association between contact quality and young
people’s attitudes towards older adults. Contact frequency, extended contact, and the
demographic variables were included as covariates. The total effect of contact quality on
attitudes wassignificant,B = .39,SE = .10,t = 3.78,p < .001,whereas thedirect effectwas
not, B = .15, SE = .11, t = 1.34, p = .185. The total indirect effect through all four mediator
variables was also significant, PE = .24, SE = .08, BI CI [.100, .412], as was the specific
indirect effect through intergroup anxiety, PE = .17, SE = .08, BI CI [.052, .353]. However,

mediates between contact quality and young people’s attitudes towards older adults.

 young people’s age-related attitudes. Contact frequency, contact quality, and the
demographic variables were included as covariates. The total effect of extended contact
on attitudes was significant, B = .24, SE = .10, t = 2.32, p = .023, whereas the direct
effect was not, B = .02, SE = .11, t = 0.19, p = .847. The total indirect effect was also
significant, PE = .22, SE = .07, BI CI [.101, .381] as were the specific indirect effects
through intergroup anxiety, PE = .11, SE = .05, BI CI [.031, .263], and ingroup norms,
PE = .09, SE = .05, BI CI [.006, .213]. However, the specific indirect effect through
ageing anxiety, PE = �.0002, SE = .02, BI CI [�.042, .049], and self-disclosure, PE = .01,
SE = .05, BI CI [�.065, .145], were not significant. This confirms that intergroup anxiety
and ingroup norms mediate between extended contact and young people’s age-related
attitudes.
Discussion
Study 3 investigated the relationships between different types of intergenerational
contact and young people’s age-related attitudes and additionally examined the potential
mediating roles of intergroup anxiety, ageing anxiety, ingroup norms, and self-disclosure.
Like those from Studies 1 and 2, the present results suggest that frequent intergenerational
contact alone may not be sufficient to reduce ageism; it is the perceived quality of
intergenerational contact and the knowledge that other young people have positive
relationships with older adults that has the potential to improve young people’s attitudes
towards older adults. Moreover, as in Study 2, intergroup anxiety mediated the positive
effects of both contact quality and extended contact on young people’s age-related
attitudes. However, unlike Study 2, ageing anxiety did not emerge as a significant mediator
in Study 3 and neither did self-disclosure but ingroup norms mediated the effect of
extended contact on attitudes. Together, these results suggest that experiencing good
quality direct contact with older adults reduces the concerns many young people have
about intergenerational encounters, which in turn improves their attitudes towards older
adults as a whole. Likewise, knowing that other young people in their close social network
have positive relationships with older adults can similarly reduce intergroup anxiety and
make such relationships seem more widespread and acceptable, and thus indirectly
reduce ageism.
GENERAL DISCUSSION
The developed world is experiencing a rapid shift towards greater numbers of older
people relative to younger people, as average life expectancies continue to increase and
birth rates decrease (United Nations, 2007). This significant demographic shift is
occurring against a background of research suggesting that ageism is the most common
type of prejudice (Abrams et al., 2009). This suggests an urgent need to better understand
factors that lead to the development of age-related attitudes in young people, so that it may
be possible to reduce ageism.
In three studies, we examined the relationships between different types of
intergenerational contact and young people’s attitudes towards older adults. Although
no significant relationships emerged between the frequency of intergenerational contact
and young people’s age-related attitudes, contact quality and extended contact were
associated with more positive attitudes towards older people in all three studies. Finding
that good quality contact is associated with less ageism but contact frequency is not is

 consistent with several previous intergenerational contact studies (Bousfield &
Hutchison, 2010; Hutchison et al., 2010; Schwartz & Simmons, 2001). Likewise, although
there is some evidence in the contact literature of a link between contact frequency and
prejudice (see Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), good quality contact typically emerges as the
stronger and more reliable predictor of reduced prejudice (e.g., Islam & Hewstone, 1993;
Prestwich, Kenworthy, Wilson, & Kwan-tat, 2008; Tawagi & Mak, 2015). Thus, the
present results concur with those in the wider contact literature and suggest that frequent
contact with older individuals may not be sufficient to reduce ageism; it is the perceived
quality of intergenerational contact that has the greater potential to improve young
people’s attitudes towards older adults and therefore reduce ageism. The present results
are therefore consistent with Allport’s (1954) emphasis on the nature of intergroup
contact rather than on contact per se (see also Amir, 1969).
Although extended contact was associated with less ageism in all three studies, when
we tested the unique effects of each type of contact (direct frequency, direct quality, and
extended contact) using regression analyses we found that in Studies 1 and 2 both contact
quality and extended contact accounted for variance in attitudes over and above the
variance accounted for by direct forms of contact, whereas in Study 3, only contact quality
emerged as a unique predictor of attitudes. Nevertheless, when meta-analytically
summarized over the three studies, extended contact was associated with less ageism
even when controlling for the effects of direct contact.1 Therefore, the current research
shows that in addition to direct contact between young and older adults, extended
intergenerational contact can influence young people’s attitudes towards older adults and
therefore reduce ageism. This suggests that direct contact with older adults may not even
be necessary for the positive attitudinal outcomes of contact to be realized – simply
knowing that other young people have positive relationships with older adults may be
sufficient to reduce ageism.
One reason why extended contact independently predicted ageism in Studies 1 and
Study 2 but not in Study 3 may be due to the samples used. Studies 1 and 2 used student
samples, whereas Study 3 used a less homogeneous sample consisting primarily of non-
students. Contact occurring within a university context may provide the contact
participants with an additional shared identity (e.g., as students) making the contact
appear more normative, whereas contact in other contexts may appear less normative and
hence explain the weaker effects of extended contact in Study 3’s more diverse sample.
This is consistent with Fox and Giles’s (1993) proposed model of intergenerational
contact, which suggests that contact contexts and/or locations can alter the perceived
status of the groups in the contact situation and affect attitudes resulting from contact.
An interesting finding in all three studies is that contact quality and extended contact
were associated with the other variables in similar ways while being uncorrelated with
each other. In contrast, in intercultural contact studies, contact quality and extended
contact are typically positively correlated (e.g., G�
omez et al., 2011; Hutchison &
Rosenthal, 2011) as are direct and indirect friendships (De Tezanos-Pinto et al., 2010;
Turner, Tam, Hewstone, Kenworthy, & Cairns, 2013; Turner et al., 2007). This suggests
that the effects of direct and indirect intergenerational contact may be unique, as they
1 To obtain a clearer picture of the unique effects of extended contact across the three studies, we conducted a meta-analysis to
examine the aggregated effect of extended contact on attitudes. This confirmed that extended contact was significantly
associated with attitudes even when controlling for direct contact (contact frequency and contact quality) and demographic
variables: Z (weighted by sample size, N = 273) = 5.02, mean R2 = .31, mean Fisher’s Z = .32, p = 2.67 E-7. The fail-safe
number (p = .05) was 25.2.

 appear to occur independently but have similar attitudinal outcomes. A possible
explanation for this finding is that, due to social norms discouraging intergenerational
relationships (Nelson, 2005), young adults with intergenerational friends are less likely to
tell other young adults about such friendships and similarly they may be less likely to
receive information from their peers about their friendships with older adults. In contrast,
a young adult with an interethnic friend may be more likely to disclose and even promote
this relationship to his or her peers as intercultural friendships are supported by wider
societal norms as a progressive way to reduce prejudice towards ethnic minorities
(Aboud, Mendelson, & Purdy, 2003). This may explain why contact quality and extended
contact are correlated in the wider contact literature but not in intergenerational contact
situations.
In Studies 2 and 3, we additionally examined mediating variables. In both studies, the
positive effects of good quality direct contact and extended contact were explained by
reduced intergroup anxiety: the better the quality of contact that young people have with
older adults and the more intergenerational relationships they are aware of, the less
anxious they are about impending intergenerational encounters, and the less ageist they
are. Finding that intergroup anxiety mediates the effects of direct contact is consistent
with previous intergenerational contact studies (Bousfield & Hutchison, 2010; Hutchison
et al., 2010) and the wider contact literature (for a review, see Pettigrew & Tropp, 2008).
However, the present studies are the first to demonstrate that intergroup anxiety also
mediates the effects of extended intergenerational contact. These findings suggest that
like other types of prejudice, ageism can be appropriately conceptualized as an intergroup
process (Fox & Giles, 1993).
In Study 2, the relationships between both contact quality and extended contact
and reduced ageism were also mediated by reduced ageing anxiety. This suggests
that positive direct or indirect experiences with older adults have the potential to
reduce the concerns that young people may have about their own ageing, and
therefore to improve their attitudes towards older people as a whole. While previous
research has indicated that direct intergenerational contact can reduce ageism
indirectly by reducing ageing anxiety (Allan & Johnson, 2009; Allan et al., 2014), the
present studies are the first to show that extended contact can also reduce ageing
anxiety and therefore indirectly reduce ageism.
In Study 3, contact quality and extended contact were similarly associated with less
ageing anxiety, and ageing anxiety was associated with less ageism, but the indirect path
from contact quality and extended contact to reduced ageism via ageing anxiety was not
significant. Finding that ageing anxiety mediated both direct and extended contact’s
relationships with attitudes in Study 2 but not in Study 3 may again be attributable to
differences in the samples used. In particular, university students, who formed a higher
proportion of the sample in Study 2 than Study 3, are likely to have more direct and
extended contact with competent older adults (e.g., professors, mature students), which
may help explain the stronger correlations between both types of contact and ageing
anxiety in Study 2 than in Study 3, and hence the lack of mediation effects in Study 3.
Future research should measure the competency and/or dependency levels of older adults
involved in intergenerational contact and examine their relationships with ageing anxiety
(see also Allan & Johnson, 2009).
At face value, finding that intergenerational contact reduces ageing anxiety and
indirectly reduces ageism may appear to contradict the idea that older adults present a
threat to young people by reminding them of their own ageing (Greenberg et al., 2002).
However, rather than being contradictory, it seems reasonable to assume that positive
Intergenerational contact and ageism
537
 direct or indirect experiences with older adults may go some way towards disconfirming
the negative expectations young people may have about older adults and the ageing
process more generally, therefore reducing their concerns about their own ageing and
improving their attitudes towards older people as a whole. Along these lines, Hutchison
et al. (2010) found that good quality contact with older adults was associated with more
positive expectations among young people about the possible outcomes of intergener-
ational encounters, which in turn predicted less ageism (see also Plant & Devine, 2003).
Future research should investigate the role of young people’s expectations about the
consequences of ageing in the relationship between intergenerational contact, ageing
anxiety, and ageism.
In Study 2, we also examined ingroup norms and self-disclosure as potential mediating
variables, finding that ingroup norms mediated extended contact’s reduction of ageism.
This is consistent with the idea that experiencing indirect cross-group friendships
increases their acceptability by making them appear more widespread and familiar, thus
creating an indirect pathway to more positive attitudes (Wright et al., 1997). Although
good quality direct contact was associated with more positive ingroup norms about
intergenerational relationships, and ingroup norms was associated with less ageism, there
was no indirect pathway from contact quality to attitudes via ingroup norms. Finding that
ingroup norms mediate the effects of extended contact but not direct contact is consistent
with previous contact studies (e.g., De Tezanos-Pinto et al., 2010) and supports the idea
that knowing that their same-aged peers have older friends makes intergenerational
friendships seem more widespread and acceptable, thus reducing ageism. On the other
hand, having direct intergenerational friendships does not provide information about the
frequency of other young adults’ intergenerational friendships or the acceptability of such
friendships. This may explain why ingroup norms mediated the relationship between
extended contact and reduced ageism but not the relationship between contact quality
and reduced ageism.
Although self-disclosure did not emerge as a significant mediating variable in Study
3 it was positively correlated with direct and extended contact and with more
positive attitudes towards older people. This suggests that, as with other types of
intergroup contact (Turner et al., 2007), self-disclosure has the potential to reduce
prejudice but in the context of intergenerational contact the effects are not
sufficiently strong to explain the relationship between contact and more positive
attitudes towards older people. One reason for this may be due to problems in young
people’s communication with unfamiliar older adults. For example, young people are
more likely to communicate with, and therefore self-disclosure to, other young people
especially via social media, which is less commonly used by older adults (Duggan &
Brenner, 2013; Walther, 1996). Additionally, young adults often feel patronized (Giles
& Williams, 1994) and anxious when experiencing excessive self-disclosure by older
adults (Coupland, Coupland, & Giles, 1991). Thus, it may be that intergenerational
anxiety needs to be reduced before self-disclosure can mediate between intergener-
ational contact and ageism. Along these lines, Pettigrew and Tropp (2008) proposed a
causal sequence whereby initial anxieties must first be reduced through intergroup
contact before other variables can affectively contribute to prejudice reduction.
Future research should test this sequence in the context of relations between young
and older adults. It may be that self-disclosure plays a more important role in reducing
ageism once intergenerational anxieties are reduced.
Taken together, the findings suggest that designs for successful ageism reduction
interventions could utilize either direct or extended contact (see Cameron et al., 2011;
538
Lisbeth Drury et al.
 Jarrott & Smith, 2011) or a combination of both. For example, Eller et al. (2012) showed
that extended contact paved the way for future direct contact, which in turn predicted
more positive outgroup attitudes. Therefore, employing an extended contact task before a
direct intergenerational programme could potentially enhance the outcomes. Alterna-
tively, direct intergenerational programmes could be followed up by young adults’ peer-
to-peer dissemination of their positive programme experiences, thus creating an
extended contact effect with other young adults not involved in the original direct
programme (see also Atkinson & Bray, 2013).
Furthermore, our findings shed light on some of the psychological mechanisms
through with direct and extended contact can reduce ageism. In particular, the results
suggest that important variables to consider when devising strategies or interventions
aimed at reducing ageism are those that assist in the reduction of young people’s anxieties
about intergenerational encounters and their own ageing. It is similarly important to foster
the formation of positive ingroup norms about intergenerational relationships and to
encourage voluntary sharing of personal information. The present research suggests that
good quality direct, and extended intergenerational contact may go some way towards
achieving these aims, and strategies targeted at reducing ageism should capitalize on the
findings.
Although the results from all three studies are broadly in line with predictions, there
are limitations with the present research. As with most contact studies, our findings are
based on cross-sectional survey data, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions
about causal relationships. With this in mind, future research should be conducted
longitudinally and experimentally to allow for stronger inferences about the relationships
between the variables examined in the present studies (e.g., Eller, Abrams, &
Zimmermann, 2011).
It should also be noted that negative attitudes towards older people are often
internalized in older adults themselves (Levy & Banaji, 2002). This is not entirely
surprising given that young people with ageist attitudes will in time become members
of the older generation. Such attitudes may reinforce the marginalization and
disempowerment of older adults (Bousfield & Hutchison, 2010). Thus, future research
and ageism reduction interventions should seek to identify factors influencing older
adults’ ageism towards their own generation as well as the ageism of young people
towards older adults.
In conclusion, the present results suggest that direct contact with older adults
may not be necessary to reduce ageism in young people: simply knowing that other
young people have positive relationships with older individuals may be sufficient to
achieve this aim. The results also shed light on the psychological mechanisms
through which direct and extended contact can reduce ageism. These findings may
be important when devising strategies aimed at reducing ageism, especially in the
current social climate where the gap between young people and older adults is
widening and opportunities for direct intergenerational contact are becoming
increasingly limited.
