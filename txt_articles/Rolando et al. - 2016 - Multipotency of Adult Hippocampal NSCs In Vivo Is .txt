SUMMARY 
Multi-lineage neuronal, astrocytic and oligodendrocytic potential is considered a 
neural stem cell (NSC) trait. However, hippocampal NSCs generate neurons and 
astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes in vivo and how this is regulated is unknown. Here 
we show that the RNAseIII Drosha is an intrinsic regulator of stem cell maintenance 
and differentiation in the adult mouse hippocampus. Inactivation of Drosha results in 
exhaustion of the NSC pool, premature arrest of neurogenesis, and induction of 
oligodendrocyte fate commitment. Drosha silences Nuclear Factor IB (NFIB) in 
hippocampal NSCs by targeting a double-stranded hairpin in the NFIB mRNA, thereby 
repressing its expression in a Dicer and miRNA-independent manner. We show that 
NFIB is required and sufficient for oligodendrocyte fate and knockdown of NFIB 
rescues neurogenesis by Drosha-deficient hippocampal NSCs. Our findings reveal a 
novel mechanism for stem cell maintenance and oligodendrocyte fate restriction in the 
adult hippocampus.

INTRODUCTION 
Somatic stem cells can generate progeny throughout life but their fates are usually 
restricted and they generate specific cell-types in their respective tissue. Active adult 
NSCs are present in two regions of the brain: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the 
lateral ventricles and the subgranule zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) (Ihrie 
and Alvarez-Buylla, 2011; Kriegstein and Alvarez-Buylla, 2009). Although both SVZ 
and DG NSCs are multipotent, they generate specific neuron-types. SVZ NSCs become 
fate restricted during embryonic development and generate multiple interneuron 
populations from topological locations in the lateral ventricle wall (Merkle et al., 2007). 
DG NSCs produce only granule neurons which contribute to cognition, and loss or 
dormancy of stem cells during aging can result in psychological disorders and disease 
(Kronenberg et al., 2003; Petrus et al., 2009; Santarelli et al., 2003; Steiner et al., 2008). 
Whereas SVZ NSCs make a significant number of oligodendrocytes (Hack et al., 2004; 
Menn et al., 2006), new oligodendrocytes are normally not produced in the adult DG 
(Bonaguidi et al., 2011; Encinas et al., 2011; Lugert et al., 2010). In vitro, DG NSCs 
also rarely produce oligodendrocytes, although oligodendrocytic differentiation can be 
induced by their co-culture with neurons and in vivo by inactivation of the 
Neurofibromin 1 gene or reprogramming with the transcription factor Ascl1 (Braun et 
al., 2015; Jessberger et al., 2008; Song et al., 2002; Suh et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2015). 
This suggests an intrinsic and niche-independent fate restriction of DG NSCs that 
prevents oligodendrocyte formation. How DG NSC potency and particularly 
oligodendrocytic fate are restricted remains unclear. 
Drosha is part of the miRNA microprocessor (Ha and Kim, 2014). However, Drosha 
can also cleave and directly destabilize mRNAs encoding proteins that regulate cell fate 
decisions (Chong et al., 2010; Han et al., 2009; Knuckles et al., 2012; Macias et al., 
  
4 
2012). During embryonic development, Drosha maintains embryonic NSCs in an 
undifferentiated, multipotent state by targeting and cleaving the mRNA of the proneural 
factor Ngn2 (Knuckles et al., 2012). This non-canonical function of Drosha does not 
require Dicer or miRNAs, and is a rapid mechanism for fate regulation. 
Here, we examined how Drosha is involved in the regulation of DG NSC fate. We 
found that Drosha controls DG NSC maintenance and cell fate acquisition through a 
non-canonical regulation of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor IB (NFIB). We show 
that NFIB is required for the oligodendrocytic commitment by DG NSCs and propose 
that Drosha promotes neurogenesis and inhibits oligodendrocyte fate acquisition in the 
hippocampus by repressing NFIB.

RESULTS 
Drosha deletion from adult DG NSCs impairs neurogenesis 
NSCs in the DG of the adult mouse are Notch-dependent and express the Notch 
target Hes5 (Lugert et al., 2010, 2012). Drosha is expressed by most cells in the DG 
including GFAP+ and Hes5+ radial NSCs (Figure S1A and S1B). To address the 
functions of Drosha in neurogenic DG NSCs, we treated Hes5::CreERT2 mice carrying 
floxed Drosha (Drosha cKO) or wild type Drosha (ctrl) alleles with Tamoxifen (TAM), 
and followed cell fate by lineage tracing (Rosa26-CAG::EGFP) (Figure 1A and S1A) 
(Lugert et al., 2012). Twenty-one days after TAM administration, Hes5+ NSCs and their 
progeny were Drosha-deficient and generated fewer cells compared to controls (Figure 
S1B-D). Furthermore, the number of radial GFAP+, Sox2+ and mitotic (PCNA+) 
NSC/progenitors and neuroblasts (DCX+) was reduced in Drosha cKO animals (Figure 
1B-F and S1E). Decreased neurogenesis persisted in Drosha cKO animals at 100 days 
and the reduction in newborn neurons (GFP+NeuN+) was accompanied by an increase in 
S100+ parenchymal astrocytes compared to controls (Figure 1G-I and S1F-J). In 
addition, GFAP+ putative radial NSCs were lost in Drosha cKO animals (Figure 1G and 
1J and 1K). Together these data suggest that Drosha is required for NSC maintenance 
and promotes neurogenesis in the DG at the expense of gliogenesis. 
Quiescent DG NSCs activate, proliferate and produce neuroblasts in response to 
seizures (Huttmann et al., 2003; Sierra et al., 2015; Steiner et al., 2008). We addressed 
whether NSC-like progenitors remain in the Drosha cKO and can still respond to 
activating stimuli. We administered epileptogenic kainic acid (KA) to induce seizures in 
Hes5::CreERT2 Drosha cKO and control mice 21 days after TAM-induction (Figure 
S1K). Whereas KA induced proliferation and an increase in neuroblasts in control 
animals (Figure S1L and S1M), neither proliferation (PCNA+) nor neuroblast (DCX+) 
  
6 
production was increased following KA-treatment of Drosha cKO mice (Figure S1L 
and S1N). This suggests that Drosha cKO diminishes the DG NSC pool and 
compromises progenitor reactivation. 
Drosha cKO induces oligodendrocyte commitment of NSCs 
To examine whether Drosha controls neurogenesis by acting on quiescent NSCs, we 
ablated Drosha specifically in radial GFAP+ NSCs by stereotactic infection with 
adenoviruses expressing Cre-recombinase under the control of the gfap promoter 
(adeno-gfap::Cre) (Figure S2A) (Merkle et al., 2007). Six days post-infection (dpi), 
most GFP labeled, adeno-gfap::Cre infected cells in the subgranular zone in control 
mice were GFAP+ putative radial NSCs (Figure S2B-D). Twenty-one dpi, adeno-
gfap::Cre infected NSCs had generated mitotic (PCNA+) progenitors and neuroblasts 
(DCX+) in control animals but Sox2+ and PCNA+ progenitors were almost absent and 
newly formed neuroblasts were reduced in Drosha cKO animals (Figure 2A-E). 
Therefore, Drosha cKO DG NSCs lose stem cell potential demonstrating that Drosha is 
essential for NSCs maintenance and neurogenesis. 
DG NSCs normally generate glutamatergic granule neurons and astrocytes but not 
oligodendrocytes (Bonaguidi et al., 2011). Following adeno-gfap::Cre mediated Drosha 
cKO, a significant number of the newborn cells expressed Olig2 and Sox10, markers of 
oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) (Figure 2D-G). Similarly, we observed newly 
generated Sox10+, Olig2+ and NG2+ OPCs in Hes5::CreERT2 Drosha cKO animals 
(Figure S2E-G). Thus, Drosha cKO induces a fate switch in DG NSCs to 
oligodendrocytes. 
We performed clonal analysis of Hes5::CreERT2 Drosha cKO NSC fate. Two days 
after low-dose TAM-induction, labeled NSCs were sparse in the DG (mean distance 
between clones = 184.3 ± 17.2µm; Figure S2H and S2I). Twenty-one days post-TAM, 6 
  
7 
of the 41 clones examined in Drosha cKO animals contained OPCs but none in the 
controls (Figure 2H, 2I, S2J and S2K). Interestingly, one clone contained neuroblasts, 
astrocytes and oligodendrocytes indicating tri-lineage potential of Drosha cKO NSC in 
vivo (Figure 2H). 
We addressed whether Drosha controls oligodendrocyte production from mitotic GFAP- 
stem/progenitor cells. We infected dividing cells in the DG with a Cre-expressing 
retrovirus. We did not see oligodendrocyte formation in the Drosha cKO after retro-Cre 
virus infection and active progenitors continued to generate neuroblasts (Figure S2L and 
S2M). These data suggest that Drosha-deletion induces a fate shift in the quiescent NSC 
pool to oligodendrocyte production but not in active NSC/progenitors. 
Dicer regulates miRNA maturation downstream of Drosha. To investigate whether 
Drosha regulates oligodendrocyte commitment of NSCs via miRNAs, we deleted Dicer 
(Dicer cKO) from radial DG NSCs with the adeno-gfap::Cre virus (Figure S2A). Dicer 
cKO did not affect the number of Sox2+ progenitors (data not shown) and caused a 
minor decrease in neuroblasts consistent with the role of Dicer in neuronal survival and 
maturation (Figure 2G, S2N and S2O) (Davis et al., 2008). Unlike Drosha cKO, Dicer 
cKO did not induce oligodendrocytic differentiation of DG NSCs (ctrl vs. Dicer cKO P 
= 0.56, Figure 2F and 2G). Therefore, Drosha but not Dicer inhibits oligodendrocyte 
differentiation of adult DG NSCs in vivo indicating that the mechanism of induced fate 
switching caused by the loss of Drosha does not primarily involve miRNAs. 
Drosha cKO DG NSCs produce oligodendrocytes in vitro 
To investigate the mechanisms of Drosha-regulated NSC fate acquisition, we 
generated a self-renewing DG NSC culture system that recapitulates in vivo features of 
neurogenesis including expression of the progenitor markers Sox2 and BLBP (Figure 
S2P). Upon growth factor removal (-FGF2/-EGF), DG NSCs differentiated into neurons 
  
8 
and astrocytes but not oligodendrocytes indicating conserved intrinsic cell fate 
restriction (Figure S2Q and not shown) (Bonaguidi et al., 2011; Lugert et al., 2010). We 
cultured DG NSCs from adult Droshafl/fl, Dicerfl/fl and Droshawt/wtDicerwt/wt (control) 
animals that carried the Rosa26-CAG::EGFP Cre-reporter. Following adeno-Cre viral 
transduction, we investigate the effects of Drosha and Dicer cKO (Figure S2R and S2S). 
Two dpi, BLBP+ progenitors were reduced in the Drosha cKO compared to control and 
Dicer cKO cultures similar to the reduction in progenitors after Drosha ablation in vivo 
(Figure 2J-M). Both differentiated Drosha cKO and Dicer cKO NSCs generated fewer 
neurons in vitro (Figure 2M and S2T-V). However, we observed an increase in 
apoptotic cells (cleaved-Caspase3+) in the Dicer cKO cultures compared to Drosha cKO 
and control confirming that Dicer is crucial for neuronal survival, and providing an 
explanation for the reduction in neurons in its absence (Figure S2W). Drosha cKO 
induced an increase in NG2+ OPCs in the cultures and this at the expense of neuron and 
astrocyte production (Figure 2K, 2M and S2X). Dicer cKO induced a slight but not 
significant increase in NG2+ OPCs in the cultures (ctrl vs. Dicer cKO P = 0.27, Figure 
2L and 2M). Hence, DG NSCs retain a cell intrinsic bias against oligodendrocyte 
differentiation in vitro and Drosha controls this fate decision. We sorted Drosha cKO, 
Dicer cKO and control DG NSCs 48 hours after adeno-Cre virus infection in vitro and 
determined the expression profiles of 381 miRNAs by microarray. 260 miRNAs were 
detected in control DG NSCs (mean Ct values below 32) and their levels were not 
significantly changed 48 hours after Drosha cKO (R2= 0.81; Figure S2Y) even though 
the phenotypes were well established by this time. Dicer cKO resulted in moderate 
changes in miRNA levels after 48 hours (R2= 0.66; Figure S2Z), although Dicer cKO 
NSCs did not display an obvious phenotype at this time. Hence, Drosha cKO did not 
cause major global changes in miRNA levels and any changes were less than in Dicer 
  
9 
cKO DG NSCs. These data support that the mechanism of Drosha suppression of 
oligodendrocyte production by DG NSCs is independent of Dicer and miRNAs. 
Drosha binds and cleaves the NFIB mRNA regulating expression 
Drosha can bind and cleave hairpin loops in mRNAs (Chong et al., 2010; Han et al., 
2009; Knuckles et al., 2012; Macias et al., 2012). In silico analysis (Evofold) (Pedersen 
et al., 2006) revealed two evolutionarily conserved hairpins in the mRNA of NFIB, a 
short 20 bases hairpin in the 5’ untranslated region (hereafter refer to as 5’ UTR HP) 
and a longer hairpin of 83 bases in the 3’ untranslated region (hereafter refer to as 3’ 
UTR HP) (Figure 3A). NFIB plays roles in the development of glial cells and myelin 
tracts (Barry et al., 2008; Deneen et al., 2006; Harris et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2012; 
Steele-Perkins et al., 2005). To examine whether Drosha binds directly to NFIB mRNA 
in DG NSCs, we performed cross-linked immunoprecipitation (CLIP) for endogenous 
Drosha protein and examined the bound RNAs (Figure S3A and S3B). NFIB mRNA 
CLIPed with Drosha from DG NSCs as did the known target DGCR8 mRNA (Figure 
3B and S3B) (Han et al., 2009; Knuckles et al., 2012). 
In order to address whether either of the two NFIB mRNA hairpins convey Drosha 
association, we placed the 5’ UTR HP and 3’ UTR HP into the SV40 3’ UTR 
downstream of the Renilla Luciferase (rLuc) coding region of the psiCheck reporter 
vector (Figure 3C). We expressed 5’ UTR HP and 3’ UTR HP containing rLuc mRNAs 
in N2a cells and performed CLIP to address binding by Drosha. Both the 5’ UTR HP 
and 3’ UTR HP of NFIB bound to Drosha more efficiently than the SV40 3’ UTR 
sequence alone (Figure 3D). These data suggest that both NFIB mRNA hairpins are 
bound by Drosha. 
We evaluated whether Drosha cleaves the NFIB hairpins by in vitro processing 
assays (Figure 3E) (Lee and Kim, 2007). Incubation of in vitro transcribed NFIB 3’ 
  
10 
UTR RNA with purified Flag-tagged Drosha resulted in cleavage and generation of 
RNA fragments (Figure 3F). NFIB 5’ UTR HP was not cleaved in vitro suggesting that, 
although bound, its not processed by Drosha (Figure S3C). We assessed whether 
fragmented NFIB mRNAs were present in DG NSCs in vivo by 5� rapid amplification of 
cDNA ends (5’RACE). Multiple NFIB mRNAs fragmented in the vicinity of the 3’ 
UTR HP were detected in wild-type NSCs (Figure S3D). Fragmented NFIB transcripts 
were not detected in Drosha cKO NSCs supporting that NFIB mRNA fragmentation at 
the 3’ UTR HP is dependent on Drosha (Figure S3D). Sequencing and mapping of 48 
independent clones of the NFIB 5’RACE fragments supported the in vitro processing 
analysis (Figure 3F and S3D). The multiple fragmented RNA species suggest that either 
Drosha processing of the 3’ UTR HP is not as accurate as its processing of a pri-miRNA 
RNA or additional ribonucleases may be associated with the Drosha complex and these 
cleave the RNAs further. We analyze changes in NFIB RNA fragmentation in sorted 
NSCs following Drosha cKO compared to control by qRT-PCR over the 3’ UTR HP. 
Drosha cKO increased the relative levels of non-cleaved NFIB transcripts confirming 
the Drosha-dependent destabilization of NFIB RNAs in vivo (Figure 3G). 
To evaluate whether Drosha affects translation of NFIB 3’ UTR HP mRNAs, we 
performed Luciferase assays in cultured adult DG NSCs (Figure S3E). Drosha cKO 
increased Luciferase activity of an NFIB 3’ UTR HP containing synthetic mRNA 
(Figure S3F). Surprisingly, Dicer cKO also increased translation of the NFIB 3’ UTR 
HP containing Luciferase mRNA by an unknown mechanism indicating that under these 
experimental conditions Dicer can also regulate NFIB 3’ UTR HP containing mRNAs. 
Drosha interaction with hairpins in mRNAs can result in destabilization of the 
transcripts (Han et al., 2009; Knuckles et al., 2012). We isolated Hes5::CreERT2 Drosha 
cKO and Hes5::CreERT2 control (Droshawt/wt) DG NSCs by fluorescence-activated cell 
  
11 
sorting (FACS) based on GFP expression from the Cre-activated Rosa26-CAG::EGFP 
locus following acute induction with TAM (Figure S3G). Drosha mRNA levels were 
reduced in Drosha cKO cells compared to controls (Figure S3G). Interestingly, NFIB 
mRNA levels were increased in Drosha cKO NSCs suggesting that Drosha suppresses 
NFIB mRNA expression in DG NSCs in vivo (Figure S3G). As cultured DG NSCs 
retain Drosha function and blockade of oligodendrocyte differentiation, we speculated 
that Drosha-dependent regulation of NFIB should also be present in vitro. We infected 
DG NSCs in vitro with adeno-Cre virus and isolated Drosha cKO and control NSCs by 
FACS 2 dpi (Figure S3H). NFIB and Sox10 mRNA levels were increased in cultured 
Drosha cKO but not in Dicer cKO NSCs (Figure S3H). Therefore, Drosha regulates 
NFIB mRNA levels in DG NSCs in vivo and in vitro. 
Drosha cKO-induced oligodendrocytic differentiation depends on NFIB 
We addressed whether NFIB is sufficient to drive oligodendrogenesis from adult DG 
NSCs. Overexpressed NFIB increased Sox10+ and NG2+ OPCs in DG NSC cultures and 
had a negative impact on neurogenesis (Figure 4A and S4A-E). Therefore, expression 
of NFIB is sufficient to induce programming of DG NSCs to oligodendrocytes. We 
addressed whether NFIB is required for the Drosha cKO induced oligodendrocyte 
differentiation of NSCs. We ablated Drosha from DG NSCs in vitro with adeno-Cre 
viruses and simultaneously prevented NFIB mRNA accumulation by knockdown using 
specific esiRNAs (Figure 4B). Twenty-four hours after esiRNA transfection, NFIB 
mRNAs were undetectable in DG NSCs compared to cells transfected with a control 
rLuc esiRNA (Figure S4F). Neither esiRNA rLuc nor esiRNA NFIB expression 
affected the differentiation of control DG NSCs (Figure 4C, 4D, S4G and S4H). As 
expected, most Drosha cKO NSCs transfected with the esiRNA rLuc differentiated into 
NG2+ OPCs (Figure 4C and 4E). In contrast, NFIB knockdown reduced NFIB 
  
12 
expression and decreased oligodendrocytic differentiation of Drosha cKO cells (Figure 
4C and 4F). Like their control counterparts, NFIB knockdown Drosha cKO NSCs 
adopted a neuronal fate or remained as progenitors (Figure 4G and 4H). Thus, Drosha 
negatively regulates DG NSC differentiation towards an oligodendrocytic fate by 
suppressing NFIB mRNA levels (Figure S4I). Upon Drosha cKO, inhibition of NFIB is 
released and an oligodendrocytic differentiation program is activated (Figure S4J).

DISCUSSION 
Adult NSC identity is orchestrated by complex regulatory gene networks and 
neurogenic niche microenvironments. Post-transcriptional modifications add an 
additional level of regulation to NSC maintenance and differentiation. Growing 
evidence suggest that miRNA-independent functions of the microprocessor are 
conserved mechanisms that regulate several cellular processes in the nervous system 
and other tissues (Chong et al., 2010; Han et al., 2009; Karginov et al., 2010; Knuckles 
et al., 2012; Macias et al., 2012). 
Here we show that Drosha plays a central role in regulating progenitors of the adult 
DG by sustaining NSC potential. Upon Drosha ablation, DG NSCs are depleted and 
gliogenesis increases at the expense of neurogenesis. By comparing Drosha cKO and 
Dicer cKO mice, we identified the transcription factor NFIB as a target of Drosha and 
showed that the blockade of NFIB expression is necessary for inhibiting 
oligodendrocyte formation and enabling neurogenesis in the adult DG. Therefore, 
Drosha regulates DG neurogenesis and gliogenesis at least partially through a miRNA 
and Dicer-independent, cell-intrinsic fate program. 
CLIP experiments revealed that the microprocessor targets different RNA classes, 
including pri-miRNAs, small nucleolar RNA, long non-coding RNA and mRNAs 
(Macias et al., 2012). The microprocessor interactome has been defined in human 
embryonic stem cells and indicates the importance of cell-type and biological context 
(Seong et al., 2014). However, it is clear that several mRNAs are processed by the 
microprocessor resulting in their destabilization (Chong et al., 2010; Johanson et al., 
2015; Knuckles et al., 2012). The non-canonical functions of the microprocessor 
represent a rapid and efficient way to influence gene expression. Our understanding of 
the mechanisms underlying these alternative functions of Drosha and the 
  
14 
microprocessor need further investigation. The Drosha-DGCR8 complex is required for 
miRNA biogenesis, but it is possible that other protein-protein interactions underlie the 
alternate functions of Drosha (Macias et al., 2015). 
DG NSCs are fate committed to glutamatergic granule neuron and astrocytic fates in 
vivo (Bonaguidi et al., 2011; Lugert et al., 2010). How this intrinsic fate restriction is 
controlled remained unclear. In vitro studies showed that DG NSCs are only able to 
generate oligodendrocytes under specific conditions including co-culture with neurons 
(Song et al., 2002; Suh et al., 2007). Furthermore, reprogramming of adult DG NSCs by 
Ascl1 overexpression leads to a shift in fate from neuronal to oligodendrocyte 
differentiation (Braun et al., 2015; Jessberger et al., 2008) A potential link between 
Drosha and Ascl1 remains to be shown, however, Ascl1 mRNA was not CLIPed with 
Drosha from DG NSCs (data not shown). 
Clonal lineage tracing of DG NSCs in vivo showed symmetric and asymmetric 
neuron and astrocytic fates (Bonaguidi et al., 2011). Drosha cKO NSCs exited the stem 
cell pool and the cell cycle and generated few progeny. However, at the population and 
single cell levels DG NSCs retain the potential to generate all three cell-lineages of the 
brain but Drosha mediates the intrinsic restriction of oligodendrocyte differentiation 
potential. 
NFI transcription factors can activate and repress gene transcription depending on 
the gene and cellular context (Chang et al., 2013; Gronostajski, 2000; Messina et al., 
2010). NFIB influences stem cell maintenance and differentiation in several tissues 
including in the SVZ as part of a cross-regulatory network together with Pax6/Brg1 
(Chang et al., 2013; Ninkovic et al., 2013). In addition, NFIB can repress Notch 
signaling in embryonic hippocampal NSCs by repressing Hes1 promoter activity (Piper 
et al., 2010). Therefore, we speculate that induction of NFIB expression might lead to 
  
15 
inhibition of stem cell genes and block of Notch signaling resulting in exhaustion of the 
DG NSC pool and differentiation. Moreover, we also show for the first time that NFIB 
has a central function in regulating oligodendrocyte fate commitment in the adult DG. It 
remains to be shown which genes are regulated downstream of NFIB. Although we 
cannot exclude that NFIB acts as a transcriptional repressor of genes required for 
neuronal differentiation and therefore indirectly promotes gliogenesis, NG2 is up 
regulated in response to Drosha cKO in an NFIB-dependent manner. Interestingly, 
Cspg4 (the gene encoding NG2) has NFI binding motifs that are bound by NFIB 
suggesting a direct regulation in DG NSCs (Chang et al., 2013). We believe this is the 
first demonstration of a non-canonical Drosha-mediated regulation of adult stem cell 
fate through a niche-independent intrinsic pathway. In the future, it will be important to 
understand the targets of this post-transcriptional pathway and whether stem cells are 
able to modulate Drosha activity to control cell fate in order to satisfy demand.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 
Animal husbandry 
The mice used have been described previously (Supplemental Experimental 
Procedures). Mice were maintained on a 12-hour day-night cycle with free access to 
food and water under specific pathogen-free conditions and according to Swiss Federal 
regulations. All procedures were approved by the Basel Cantonal Veterinary office 
(license numbers 2537 and 2538). 
Hippocampal NSC cultures, adenoviral infection and nucleofection 
DG NSCs were isolated from 8-week old mice as described previously (Lugert et 
al., 2010). DG NSCs were infected with an adeno-Cre adenovirus at a multiplicity of 
infection of 100 and fixed after 24 or 48 hours. DG NSC cultures were nucleofected 
using a mouse neural stem cell kit (Lonza) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). 
Fluorescence activated cell sorting 
After 
TAM 
induction, 
NSCs 
were 
isolated 
from 
Hes5CreERT2Rosa26-
CAG::EGFPfl/+ 
and 
Hes5::CreERT2Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ 
using 
a 
FACSariaIII (BD Biosciences) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). 
RNA isolation, quantitative RT-PCR and analysis of miRNA expression 
Total RNA was isolated from cultured or sorted DG NSCs using Trizol reagent (Life 
Technologies). Analysis of gene expression was performed as described in the 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures. miRNAs were isolated using mirVANA kit 
(ThermoFisher) following the miRNA enrichment procedure and quantified by TaqMan 
arrays (Life Technologies) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). 
In vitro processing of NFIB HP RNAs 
  
22 
In vitro processing was performed on 5’ and 3’ UTR NFIB HP RNAs as described 
previously with minor adaptations (Supplemental Experimental Procedures) (Lee and 
Kim, 2007). 
5’ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5’ RACE) 
5’ RACE experiments were performed on 3g of total RNA of control and Drosha 
cKO NSCs following manufacture’s instructions (Invitrogen) 
(Supplemental 
Experimental Procedures). 
Luciferase Assay 
DG NSCs were transduced with an adeno-Cre adenovirus at a multiplicity of 
infection of 100 with or without subsequent nucleofection 2 days later with the 
psiCheck2 containing the 3’ UTR HP or 5’ UTR HP or control psiCheck2 vectors 
(Supplemental Experimental Procedures). 
Quantification and statistics 
Randomly selected, stained cells were analyzed with fixed photomultiplier settings 
on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal and Apotome2 microscope. For clonal analysis the entire 
hippocampus was sectioned and reconstructed as described previously (Bonaguidi et al., 
2011) (Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Percentages were converted by arcsine 
transformation. Statistical comparisons were conducted by two-tailed unpaired 
Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney test, one-way ANOVA, or Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn 
post-hoc test as indicated. Statistical significance was assessed using GraphPad Prism 
software (GraphPad Software Inc.). Significance was established at P<0.05.

Supplemental Experimental Procedures 
Transgenic animals 
Hes5::CreERT2, Rosa26-CAG::EGFP, Droshafl/fl, Dicerfl/fl mice have been described elsewhere (Chong et 
al., 2008; Harfe et al., 2005; Lugert et al., 2012; Tchorz et al., 2012). All mice were maintained on a 
C57BL6 background and were 8-10 weeks old at the onset of the experiments. CreERT2-recombinase 
activity from the Hes5CreERT2 locus was induced by Tamoxifen administration (Sigma; 2 mg/injection in 
corn oil) injected as a single dose intraperitoneal daily for five consecutive days. For in vivo clonal 
analysis animals received one single injection of Tamoxifen (48 mg/kg in corn oil).  
Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry 
Mice were deeply anesthetized by injection of a ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine solution (150 mg, 7.5 
and 0.6 mg per kg body weight, respectively). Animals were perfused with ice-cold 0.9% saline followed 
by 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer. Brains were isolated and post-fixed overnight in 4% 
paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer, and then cryoprotected with 30% sucrose in phosphate 
buffer at 4°C overnight. Brains were embedded and frozen in OCT (TissueTEK) and sectioned as 30 µm 
floating sections by cryostat (Leica). Free-floating coronal sections were stored at -20°C in antifreeze 
solution until use. For clonal analysis, coronal brain sections (45 µm) through the entire dentate gyrus 
were maintained in series. 
Sections were incubated overnight at room temperature, with the primary antibody diluted in blocking 
solution of 1.5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-
buffered saline. For clonal analysis, sections where incubated for 48 hours at 4°C, with primary antibody 
in blocking solution of 1.5% normal donkey serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 2% Triton X-100 in 
phosphate-buffered saline. Antibodies used: AN2 (1:5, gift of Prof. M. Trotter), activated cleavedCASP3 
(Cell Signalling, rabbit, 1:500), BLBP (Chemicon, rabbit, 1:500), βtubulinIII (Sigma, mouse, 1:500), 
DCX (Santa Cruz, goat, 1:500), Drosha (Abcam, rabbit, 1:100), dsRed (Clonetech, rabbit, 1:500), GFAP 
(Sigma, mouse, 1:1000; Santa Cruz, goat, 1:500), GFP (AbD Serotec, sheep, 1:250; Invitrogen, rabbit, 
1:700; AvesLabs, chicken, 1:500), NeuN (Millipore, mouse, 1:1000), NG2 (Chemicon, rabbit, 1:500), 
Olig2 (Millipore, rabbit, 1:500), PCNA (DAKO, mouse, 1:1000), S100β (Sigma, mouse, 1:200), Sox2 
(Santa Cruz, goat, 1:500), Sox10 (Santa Cruz, goat, 1:500). 
Sections were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with 
the corresponding secondary antibodies in blocking solution. For clonal analysis sections where incubated 
for 24 hours at 4°C with the corresponding secondary antibody in blocking solution.  Secondary 
antibodies and detection: Alexa488/Cy3/Alexa555/Alexa594/Alexa647/Alexa649 conjugated anti-
chicken, mouse, goat, rabbit, rat and sheep immunoglobulin (1:500, Jackson Immunoresearch). Sections 
were then washed and counter-stained with DAPI (1 µg/ml). For PCNA and Drosha detection, antigens 
were recovered at 80 °C for 20 minutes in sodium citrate solution (10 mM, pH7.4). Stained sections were 
mounted on Superfrost glass slides (Thermo Scientific), embedded in mounting medium containing 
diazabicyclo-octane (DABCO; Sigma) as an anti-fading agent and visualized using a Zeiss LSM510 
confocal microscope, Leica SP5 confocal microscope or Zeiss Apotome2 microscope. 
Adeno-gfap::Cre adenoviral and retro-Cre retrovirus infections in the adult DG 
Adult (8-10 week old) mice (Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Dicerfl/flRosa26-
CAG::EGFPfl/+) were anesthetized in a constant flow of Isofluorane (3%) in oxygen and positioned in a 
stereotaxic apparatus (David Kopf instruments). Mice were injected with Temgesic subcutaneous (0.05 
mg/kg body weight). The skull was exposed by an incision in the scalp and a small hole (1 mm) drilled 
through the skull. One µl of adeno-gfap::Cre adenovirus (titer 1x1012 infectious particles per ml) or 
retrovirus-Cre (titer 2.7x107, Braun et al., 2015) was injected in the DG using a sharpened borosilicate 
glass capillaries at the stereotaxic coordinates -2 mm anteroposterior, 1.5 mm lateral to Bregma and -2.0 
mm below the surface of the skull. Mice were killed 6, 15 or 21 days after virus infection. Brain tissue 
was processed and analyzed by immunohistochemistry as described above. 
Induction of epileptic seizures  
Seizures were induced as described previously (Lugert et al., 2010), kainic acid (KA, Tocris Bioscience) 
was administered intraperitoneal at 30 mg/kg body weight. Seizures developed within 45 minutes after 
injection and spontaneously stopped within 2-3 hours. The mice were sacrificed 4 days after KA injection 
and the brains processed for immunohistochemical analysis as described above. 
Hippocampal neural stem cell cultures 
Brains of 8-week old Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Dicerfl/flRosa26-
CAG::EGFPfl/+ mice were isolated in L15 Medium (GIBCO) and sectioned live at 300 µm using a 
  
 
McIllwains tissue chopper. The DG was micro-dissected from the rest of the hippocampus under a 
dissection binocular microscope avoiding contamination with tissue from the molecular layer, cerebral 
cortex and subventricular zone, digested in a Papain based solution and mechanically dissociated as 
described previously (Lugert et al., 2010). Cells were plated in 48-well dishes (Costar) coated with 100 
µg/ml Poly-L-Lysine (Sigma) and 1 µg/ml Laminin (Sigma) in neural progenitor culture medium: 
DMEM:F12 (Gibco, Invitrogen), 2% B27 (Gibco, Invitrogen), FGF2 20 ng/ml (R&D Systems), EGF 20 
ng/ml (R&D Systems). DG NSCs were differentiated by growth factor removal and continued culture. 
Cells were fixed for 10 minutes in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer and processed as 
described above. 
Adeno-Cre adenovirus infection and AMAXA nucleofection in vitro 
Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Dicerfl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ DG NSCs 
were transduced with an adeno-Cre adenovirus (titer 1x1011 infectious particles per ml) in growth factor 
free medium and plated at a density of 5x104 cells/cm2 on poly-L-Lysine/Laminin coated coverslips. 48 
hours later, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer and process as 
described 
above. 
For 
western-blot 
experiments, 
Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, 
Droshafl/flRosa26-
CAG::EGFPfl/+, Dicerfl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ DG NSCs were transduced with an adeno-Cre 
adenovirus (titer 1x1011 infectious particles per ml) and collected in lysis buffer after 72 hours and 
processed for western-blot (see below)  
Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ and Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ adult DG NSC cultures were nucleofected 
according to the mouse neural stem cell kit instructions (Lonza). Briefly, DG NSCs were dissociated with 
trypsin and resuspended in the nucleofector solution to a final concentration of 106 cells/100µl. Cell 
suspensions were combined with either 100 pmol endoribonuclease-prepared siRNAs (esiNA) against 
NFIB or Renilla luciferase (Sigma). pCAG::mCherry was added at a ratio 1:3 to identify transfected 
NSCs. For overexpression, DG NSCs were combined with either pCMV (empty) or pCMV-HA-NFIB 
(kindly provided by Prof. Heiner Schrewe) vectors and pmaxGFP. NSCs were nucleofected with a 
Nucleofector 2b device (program A-033). NSCs were immediately transfer to neural progenitor culture 
medium and plated at the density of 5x104 cells/cm2 on poly-L-Lysine/Laminin coated coverslips. 24 
hours later, DG NSCs were transduced with an adeno-Cre adenovirus (titer 1x1011 infectious particles per 
ml) in growth factor free medium and fixed 2 dpi. For overexpression, DG NSCs were fixed 2 days post-
nucleofection. 
Fluorescence activated cell sorting  
Hes5::CreERT2Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ and Hes5::CreERT2Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ animals 
were induced with TAM for five consecutive days and brains collected 1 day after the last injection. 
NSCs were isolated as described above. Cells were washed with L15 medium (Gibco, Invitrogen), 
filtered through a 40 µm cell sieve (Miltenyi Biotec) and sorted by forward and side-scatter for live cells 
(control) and gated for GFP-negative (wild type levels) or GFP+ populations with a FACSaria III (BD 
Biosciences). DAPI (5 mg/ml) was added to discriminate living NSCs. GFP+ cells were used for RNA 
isolation and gene expression analysis (see below). 
RNA Isolation and quantitative RT-PCR 
Total RNA was isolated using the Trizol method (Life Technologies) and resuspended in water. RNA was 
treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche) to remove genomic DNA contamination. First-strand cDNA 
was generated using BioScript (Bioline) and random hexamer primers followed by quantitative PCR 
using SensiMix SYBR kit (Bioline). Expression analysis of genes of interest was performed on a Rotor-
Gene Q (Qiagen). Primers for quantitative RT-PCR were:

Analysis of miRNA expression 
Total RNA was isolated from adeno-Cre adenovirus infected Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Droshafl/flRosa26-
CAG::EGFPfl/+, Dicerfl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ DG NSCs at 2 dpi using the mirVANA isolation kit 
following the miRNA enrichment procedure. miRNA profiling was performed on TaqMan arrays (Life 
  
 
Technologies) with 500 ng of purified RNA according to manufacturer’s instructions. Expression analysis 
was performed using the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) values. 
 
Crosslinking and immunoprecipitation  
N2a cells (ATCC) were transfected using Transfectin Lipid Reagent (BioRad) according to 
manufacturer’s instructions with p3X-FLAG-CMV (Sigma) or pCK-Drosha-WT-FLAG (Han et al., 
2009; Knuckles et al., 2012) together with psiCheck2 vectors containing the NFIB hairpins. The 
transfected cells were trypsinized and collected after 48 hours. The mouse NFIB 5’ and 3’ untranslated 
regions of 200bp fragments containing the hairpins were amplified by PCR and cloned into the NotI site 
of psiCheck2 vector (Promega). The cells were cross-linked with 0.5% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 
minutes, the reaction was quenched by adding Glycine to a final concentration of 140 mM and the cells 
were lysed by sonication (10 pulses for 10 seconds). Immunoprecipitation was performed for 2 hours at 
4°C using anti-Flag M2 Affinity Gel (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing with lysis buffer, the complexes 
were reverse cross-linked at 70°C for 1 hour. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) 
according to the manufacturer´s instructions and processed as described above. 
Primers:

Luciferase Assay 
Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ and Dicerfl/flRosa26 CAG::EGFPfl/+ DG NSCs 
were transduced with adeno-Cre or adeno-GFP adenoviruses (see Adeno-Cre infection). 48 hours later, 
the NSCs were nucleofected with the psiCheck2 containing the 3’UTR or 5’UTR NFIB hairpins (see 
Crosslinking and Immunoprecipitation) using the AD1 Primary Cell 4D-Nucleofector Y Kit (Lonza) and 
program EH158. 24 hours post-nucleofection, luciferase activity was measured in a Centro LB 960 
Microplate Luminometer (Berthold) using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). 
Endogenous CLIP in DG NSCs 
A confluent 10 cm dish of DG NSCs was cross-linked at 254 nm at 300 mJ/cm2 in a BioLink UV-
Crosslinker. Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (0.1M sodium phosphate pH 7.2, 150 mM sodium 
chloride, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40) containing complete protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Roche) and afterwards treated with RNase-free DNase I (Roche). Immunoprecipitation was 
performed with Protein G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare Life Science). Rabbit anti-Drosha 
Antibody (1:200; D28B1; Cell Signaling) was coupled to the beads for 1 hour at RT, beads were washed 
three times with RIPA and immunoprecipitation was performed for 2 hours at 4°C. After washing the 
beads with RIPA buffer, the proteins were digested with 4 mg/ml recombinant PCR grade Proteinase K 
(Roche) for 1 hour at 37°C with shaking at 1000 rpm. First-strand cDNA synthesis and quantitative RT-
PCR was performed as above. 
Immunoprecipitation and Western-blot  
Beads from the endogenous Drosha immunoprecipitation were resuspended in Lämmli-Buffer containing 
2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 minutes and collected at 12000 x g for 20 seconds. Protein samples were 
separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). 
Primary antibody rabbit anti-Drosha (1:1000; D28B1, Cell Signaling), as secondary antibody HRP-
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Detection was by chemiluminescence 
(ECL, GE Healthcare). To determine Drosha and Dicer protein expression, Rosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, 
Droshafl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+, Dicerfl/flRosa26-CAG::EGFPfl/+ DG NSCs were transduced with 
adeno-Cre adenovirus. 24 or 72 hours after infection, the cells were lysed in RIPA Buffer. The lysates 
were incubated 30 minutes on ice and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 minutes. Cell 
pellets were resuspended in Lämmli-Buffer 3X. Equal amount of protein were separated by 8% SDS-
polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Primary antibodies: anti-HA 
tag (1:1000; mouse, Covance), anti-Dicer (1:300; rabbit, Sigma), anti-Drosha (1:1000; rabbit, Cell 
Signaling) and anti-GAPDH (6C5) (1:10000; mouse, Calbiochem). Secondary antibodies HRP-
conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:10000; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG 
(1:10000; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Detection was by chemiluminescence (ECL, GE Healthcare) and 
quantification by densitometry using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health, USA). 
In vitro processing 
In vitro processing experiments were performed as described previously with some adaptations (Lee and 
Kim, 2007). Briefly, N2a cells were transfected with pCMV Drosha-Flag or pCMV (empty) vectors. One 
day after transfection, total cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100mM 
KCl, 0.2mM EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1mM PMSF) by sonication followed by RNaseA (Sigma) and 
DNaseI (Roche) treatment and centrifugation at 13400 g for 15 minutes. Total extracts were used for 
  
 
immunoprecipitation in lysis buffer using Dynabead protein G (Life Technologies) coupled to mouse 
anti-Flag antibody (1:100, Sigma). 30 µl of the processing reaction were prepared and contained: 15 µl of 
beads from Drosha-Flag immunoprecipitated or uncoupled bead fraction, 6.4 mM MgCl2, 0.75 µl RNase 
Inhibitor (Invitrogen) and 0.5-1 µg RNA probe containing the 5’ UTR or 3’UTR NFIB hairpins 
transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (NEB). The reaction was carried out at 25°C for 30 minutes. RNA 
was extracted using phenol/chloroform and subsequently analyzed on a fragment analyzer using the 
DNF-472 kit (AATI) and the Low Range ssRNA ladder (NEB). 
 
5’ RACE 
5’ RACE experiments were performed on control and Drosha cKO embryonic NSCs according to 
5’RACE System for rapid amplification of cDNA ends version 2.0 kit instructions (Invitrogen). 3 µg of 
total RNA of control and Drosha cKO NSCs were used. Nested PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T 
easy vector (Promega) and sequenced by Sanger sequencing (Microsynth). Fragments were aligned to 
NFIB sequence using DNASTAR Lasergene. 
NFIB RT Primer: AGATCTGTCAATACGAGAA 
NFIB 1 Primer: GTTTTCCTAGCCTACCTGGCATT 
NFIB nested Primer: TGCCTCTTTGTCTCTACGATGC 
In vivo clonal analysis 
Confocal images were used to confirm GFP+ cell identity according to immunohistological and 
morphological properties. Whole hippocampi were serially imaged. For 3D reconstruction, optical stacks 
from the entire DG were serially aligned using Reconstruct 1.1.0 software (Fiala, 2005). Reconstructed 
hippocampi were analyzed with Imaris Software (Bitplane) with the spot detection tool and manually 
refined to mark single NSC in the DG. Single cell coordinates were obtained and analyzed using an in-
house MATLAB script (The MathWorks, Inc.) in order to get the distance to the nearest GFP+ cell 
neighbor (mean: 184.3 ± 17.2 µm, at 2 days after Tamoxifen injection).
