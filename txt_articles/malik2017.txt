IMPORTANCE Although the risk of type 2 diabetes is considered to be equivalent to coronary
heart disease (CHD) risk, there is considerable heterogeneity among individuals for CHD and
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. It is not known whether coronary artery
calcium (CAC) assessment at baseline in individuals with established metabolic syndrome
(MetS) or diabetes identifies CHD and ASCVD prognostic indicators during a long follow-up
period.
OBJECTIVE To compare improvement in long-term prognostication of incident CHD and
ASCVD using CAC scores among those with diabetes, MetS, or neither condition.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This study included participants from the Multi-Ethnic
Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study of 6814 males and females aged
45 to 84 years without known CVD from 4 race/ethnicity groups (white [38.5%], African
American [27.5%], Hispanic [22.1%], and Chinese [11.9%]) recruited from 6 US communities
from July 2000 through August 2002. Follow-up for each participant extended to the first
occurrence of an incident event, other death, loss to follow-up, or the last follow-up call
through December 31, 2013. Data analysis was performed from June 1, 2016, to September 12,
2017. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs).
Area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and net reclassification improvement
were used to compare incremental contributions of CAC score when added to the
Framingham risk score, ethnicity/race, and socioeconomic status.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES CHD events, including myocardial infarction, resuscitated
cardiac arrest, or CHD death.
RESULTS Of 6814 MESA participants, 6751 had complete risk factor and follow-up data and
were included in this study (mean [SD] age, 62.2 [10.2] years; 3186 [47.2%] male). A total of 881
(13.0%) had diabetes, 1738 (25.7%) had MetS, and 4132 (61.2%) had neither condition. After 11.1
mean years of follow-up, CHD events occurred in 84 participants with diabetes (135 ASCVD
events), 115 with MetS (175 ASCVD events), and 157 with neither (250 ASCVD events). The CAC
score was independently associated with incident CHD in multivariable analyses in those with
diabetes (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.19-1.43), MetS (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20-1.41), and neither condition
(HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27-1.47). For incident CHD, net reclassification improvement with addition of
CAC score was 0.23 (95% CI, 0.10-0.37) in those with diabetes, 0.22 (95% CI, 0.09-0.35) in
those with MetS, and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.15-0.35) in those with neither condition. The CAC score
was also a prognostic indicator of CHD and ASCVD after controlling for diabetes duration of 10
years or longer at baseline, insulin use, and glycemic control.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a large multiethnic cohort, the addition of CAC score to
global risk assessment was associated with significantly improved risk classification in those
with MetS and diabetes, even if diabetes duration was longer than a decade, suggesting a role
for the CAC score in risk assessment in such patients.

 T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome (MetS)
result in a cascade of metabolic derangement, predis-
posing individuals to not only subclinical atheroscle-
rosis but also coronary heart disease (CHD) and atheroscle-
rotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).1-5 Coronary artery
calcium (CAC) measured by noncontrast computed tomogra-
phy (CT) is a measure of subclinical atherosclerosis.6-8
Others6,9,10 have found that the presence, extent, and progres-
sion of CAC enables prognostication of adverse clinical events
betterthantraditionalriskfactorsandglobalriskscoringamong
asymptomatic individuals, and helps reclassify individuals at
intermediaterisktolow-orhigh-riskgroups.11,12However,most
prior studies11,12 that examined risk classification have ex-
cluded those with diabetes because the diagnosis of diabetes
carries a label of CHD risk equivalency,13 whereas prediction
models offer less clinical utility.14
Although the risk of diabetes is considered to be CHD risk
equivalent, studies10,15 have found that there is heteroge-
neity among individuals for CHD and ASCVD risk. Although
studies16-19examiningtheprognosticsignificanceofCACindia-
betes have found an association of CAC with CHD and CVD
events, these analyses16-19 have not focused on reclassifying
individuals with diabetes and MetS into lower- or higher-risk
groups for long-term CHD and CVD risk.
We investigated the utility of CAC scores in reclassifying
asymptomatic individuals with diabetes and MetS and the as-
sociation of CAC scores with long-term risk prognostication in
a multiethnic, population-based study. In addition, we exam-
ined whether other factors, such as duration of diabetes, are
associated with risk prognostication to aid in clinical deci-
sion making regarding screening for subclinical disease in pa-
tients with diabetes.
Methods
Study Participants
We included participants from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Ath-
erosclerosis (MESA), a prospective cohort study of 6814 men
and women aged 45 to 84 years without known CVD from 4
race/ethnicity groups (white [38.5%], African American
[27.5%], Hispanic [22.1%], and Chinese [11.9%]) recruited from
6 US communities from July 2000 through August 2002.
Details of the MESA study design have been previously
published.20 Written informed consent was provided by MESA
studyparticipants.Theaggregateddataweredeidentified.The
University of California, Irvine Institutional Review Board
granted permission for analyses of the deidentified data.
CAC Scores and Risk Factor Assessment
The CAC score was measured using cardiac-gated electron-
beam or multidetector CT, and details of scanning acquisi-
tion have been published previously.21 The CAC scores were
based on the mean results from 2 scans and adjusted using a
standard calcium phantom for calibration. Any detectable cal-
cium was defined as a CAC score greater than 0. We log-
transformed the CAC score (lnCAC score) as ln(CAC+1) to main-
tain the normality of CAC measures. The CAC scores were also
categorized as 0, 1 through 99, 100 through 399, and 400 or
greater and dichotomized as 0 or greater than 0.
Information about participant demographics, medical his-
tory, current medication use, duration of diabetes, and socio-
economic status based on income and education information
wascollectedusingstandardizedquestionnaires.Restingblood
pressure was measured with the mean of the last 2 of 3 blood
pressuremeasurementsused.Glucose,triglycerides,andhigh-
density lipoprotein cholesterol measurements were taken af-
ter a 12-hour fast at the baseline examination. Hemoglobin A1c
level was measured at examination 2, approximately 2 years
after the baseline examination. The 10-year Framingham Risk
Score (FRS) for incident CHD events was calculated as previ-
ously described,22 and the 10-year ASCVD risk score was cal-
culated from the pooled cohort equation (PCE).23
Allstudyparticipantswereclassifiedintothefollowingcat-
egories: (1) diabetes, (2) MetS without diabetes, or (3) neither
condition. Diabetes was defined as diagnosed diabetes, hav-
ing a calibrated fasting serum glucose level of 126 mg/dL or
greater (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555),
or taking hypoglycemia medication or insulin. Metabolic syn-
drome was defined as having at least 3 of the following 5 con-
ditions: (1) waist circumference of 102 cm or greater (male) or
88 cm or greater (female), (2) triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL
or greater (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by
0.0113), (3) high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level less than
40 mg/dL (male) or 50 mg/dL (female) (to convert to milli-
moles per liter, multiply by 0.0259), (4) blood pressure of
130/85 mm Hg or higher or use of hypertension medication,
and/or(5)fastingglucoselevelof100mg/dLorhigherbutwith-
out diabetes (as defined above).24
End Point Ascertainment
At intervals of 9 to 12 months, a telephone interviewer in-
quired about interim hospital admissions, cardiovascular di-
agnoses, and deaths. An adjudication committee received
copies of all death certificates and medical records for hospi-
talizations and outpatient cardiovascular diagnoses and con-
ducted next-of-kin interviews for out-of-hospital cardiovas-
cular deaths for verification.
Key Points
Question What is the long-term clinical utility of coronary artery
calcium scores for cardiovascular disease prognostication in those
with established metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes in a
multiethnic population?
Findings Coronary artery calcium scores had significant long-term
(>10 years) value in prognosticating cardiovascular disease in
patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes. A coronary artery
calcium score of 0 was associated with low cardiovascular disease
risk independent of diabetes duration, insulin use, or glycemic
control.
Meaning Assessment of subclinical disease using coronary artery
calcium scores may have robust long-term value in prognosticating
cardiovascular disease even in those who had diabetes for more
than 10 years from the time of coronary artery calcium scoring.

Statistical Analysis
Descriptivedataarepresentedasmean (SD)forcontinuousvari-
ables and number (percentage) of participants for categorical
variables. For each disease group, CHD and ASCVD incidence
rates per 1000 person-years were calculated as incident event
number per person-time at risk according to CAC score catego-
ries. Cumulative CHD and ASCVD survival rates for CAC score
categories stratified by diabetes duration, glycemic control
(hemoglobin A1câ¤7% vs >7% [to convert to proportion of total,
multiply by 0.01]), and insulin use were calculated with the
Kaplan-Meierestimatorandcomparedwiththelog-rankstatis-
tic. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate
hazard ratios (HRs) for 10-year estimated incident CHD and
ASCVD risks, separately for each disease category, comparing
FRS (or ASCVD risk score for ASCVD) with CAC score (with con-
tinuous CAC, lnCAC, and categorical CAC scores). Because he-
moglobin A1c measurements were not available at baseline but
wereavailableinexamination2,weperformedsecondaryanaly-
ses with hemoglobin A1c levels, diabetes duration, and insulin
use in the model along with our other predictors. Interaction
terms of CAC were used to examine for heterogeneity of effects
bydiseasegroupandwithinthosewithdiabetesbydiabetesdu-
ration (â¥10 vs <10 years) and insulin use.
The 10-year risk estimates were categorized as less than
5%(lowrisk),5%tolessthan7.5%(intermediaterisk),and7.5%
or more (high risk) for CHD events and ASCVD events. In the
secondary analysis, we also grouped risk as less than 7.5% or
7.5% or more for CHD or ASCVD events, consistent with the
American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association
guidelinesforconsiderationofhigh-intensitystatinuseinthose
with diabetes.25 To assess the utility of CAC scores in 10-year
risk prognostication, we used C statistics, net reclassification
improvement (NRI), and integrative discrimination index to
examine improvement of discrimination comparing models
with CAC scores and FRS (or PCE for ASCVD) with those with
FRS and PCE alone.26 The NRI was calculated as follows:
NRI =
{[P(event/up) â P(event)] Â· [P(up) + P(event)] â
[P(event/down)] Â· P(down)]}
P(event) Â· [1 â P(event)]
Up and down denote reclassification into higher- and lower-
risk categories, respectively. P(event|up), P(event|down), and
P(event) were calculated from the Kaplan-Meier estimate of
10-year event risk.
Means were compared using analysis of variance, and pro-
portions were compared between disease groups using the
Ï2 test. A 2-sided P<.05 (P < .10 for interaction test) is consid-
ered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were
performed using SAS software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
Of 6814 MESA participants, 6751 had complete risk factor and
follow-up data and were included in this study (mean [SD] age,
62.2 [10.2] years; 3186 [47.2%] male). At baseline, 881 (13.0%)
had diabetes, 1738 (25.7%) had MetS, and the remaining 4132
(61.2%) had neither condition. Those with diabetes tended to
beolderandweremorelikelymale,AfricanAmerican,andHis-
panic with poorer cardiovascular risk factors. Those with vs
without MetS also had worse risk factors (Table 1). Those with
diabetes also reported substantially higher use of lipid-
lowering medications (244 [27.7%]) compared with those with
MetS (319 [18.4%]) and those with neither condition (529
[12.8%]). Among the study participants, 329 (37.3%) of those
with diabetes (similar in those with or without MetS), 779
(44.8%) of those with MetS, and 2272 (55.0%) of those with
neither diabetes nor MetS had a CAC score of 0.
During a mean (SD) follow-up time of 11.1 (3.0) years (me-
dian, 12.2 years), CHD events occurred in 84 participants with
diabetes(135ASCVDevents),115withMetS(175ASCVDevents),
and 157 with neither diabetes nor MetS (250 ASCVD events).
Figure 1 shows the incidence rates of CHD and ASCVD accord-
ingtoCACscorecategoriesineachdiseasegroup.Ineachgroup,
a stepwise increase in observed CHD and ASCVD events was
seenwithincreasingseverityofCACscorecategories.Forthose
with diabetes but no CAC, the CHD event rate was 3.7 per 1000
person-years.
The CHD and ASCVD event rates were comparable be-
tween those with diabetes for less than 10 years and those with
diabetes for 10 years or more for all CAC score categories un-
less the CAC score was 400 or greater, in which case event rates
were higher (eFigure 1A in the Supplement). Insulin use was
reported by 117 patients with diabetes (13.3%)at baseline, and
the association among event rate, CAC score category, and use
of insulin was inconsistent; however, in the CAC score of 400
orhighercategory,insulinusewasassociatedwithhigherevent
rates (eFigure 1B in the Supplement). There was no consis-
tent association among glycemic control, CAC category, and
event rate (eFigure 1C in the Supplement). Among those with
diabetes and the highest FRS category of greater than 20%, the
CHD event rate was not high if the participant had a CAC score
of 0 (4.7 per 1000 person-years) (eFigure 1D in the Supple-
ment). Only at a PCE annual risk of 15% or greater did the event
rate among those with diabetes and a CAC score of 0 increase
to more than 7.5 per 1000 person-years (eFigure 1D in the
Supplement). The presence of MetS along with diabetes was
also associated with increased event rates (eFigure 1E in the
Supplement).
Kaplan-Meier analyses (Figure 2) revealed that patients
with a decade or more of diabetes at baseline had a greater
number of CHD and ASCVD events. In those with a CAC score
of 0, the event rate was similar for those with diabetes for a
decade or more compared with those with a shorter duration

 of diabetes. The severity of CAC was more accurate compared
with the duration of diabetes. We also examined insulin use
and CAC scores; those taking insulin had higher event rates
compared with those taking oral medications only (eFigure 2
in the Supplement). Poor glycemic control was associated with
higher event rates for every CAC score category (eFigure 3 in
the Supplement).
Compared with those with a CAC score of 0, the HRs for
CHD and ASCVD events increased progressively with higher
CAC categories; those with CAC scores of 400 or higher had
the highest HRs for CHD events (HR, 5.60; 95% CI, 2.79-
11.23, among those with diabetes) (Table 2). In the subgroup
of participants with diabetes in whom diabetes duration,
hemoglobin A1c level, and insulin use were available, the
HRs additionally adjusted for these disease severity markers
were similar to those of the main analyses, demonstrating
the robustness of our findings (Table 2). Among patients
with diabetes, the adjusted HR associated with a CAC score
of 0 was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.15-0.80) for CHD events and 0.43
(95% CI, 0.27-0.81) for ASCVD. We also tested the interac-
tion term for CAC and DM duration as well as CAC and insu-
lin use, and these interactions were not statistically signifi-
cant (eTable 1 in the Supplement).

highly significant results in all 3 disease groups when compar-

timates ranged from 0.56 to 0.65 for CHD events and from 0.45
to 0.56 for ASCVD events (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Our results indicate that evaluation of subclinical atheroscle-
rosis with CAC scoring identifies downstream CHD and ASCVD
events more than a decade after screeening has been done re-
gardless of the presence of diabetes or MetS. Coronary artery
calcium scores can be used to identify lower- and higher-risk
individualswithMetSanddiabetes.Manyindividualswithdia-
betes are at lower CHD and ASCVD risk than is widely under-
stood and are not at high risk or CHD risk equivalents. Our re-
sults also indicate that CAC scoring adds significant clinical
utility in further stratifying and reclassifying risk in persons
with MetS and diabetes beyond global risk assessment using
theFRSorASCVDPooledcohortriskscore.Moreover,wefound
that the severity of CAC appears to be a more important clini-
calprognosticindicatorthanmeasuresofdiseaseseverity,such
as insulin use, glycemic control, and diabetes duration.
Although many prior studies11,12,16-19 have excluded those
with diabetes based on assumptions that diabetes already con-
fers CHD risk equivalence, our findings indicate that 44.8% of
those with MetS and 37.3% of those with diabetes have no evi-
denceofCACatbaseline,associatedwithobserved10-yearCHD
eventratesofonly2.3%amongthosewithMetSand3.7%among
thosewithdiabetes.Thus,theâwarrantyperiodâofaCACscore
of 0, as previously discussed,27,28 can be extended to 10 years
inthosewithMetSordiabetes.Moreover,inouradjustedanaly-
ses, a CAC score of 0 was associated with low CHD and ASCVD
risk among those with diabetes that was independent of dia-
betes duration, insulin use, or glycemic control.
Previous studies have emphasized the importance of dia-
betes duration, with the Framingham Heart Study29 report-
ing a 1.4-fold greater risk of CHD and a 1.9-fold greater risk of
cardiovascular death for each 10-year increase in diabetes du-
ration and the British Regional Heart Study30 reporting dia-
betes risk to be equivalent to CHD risk only in patients with a
diabetes duration of 10 years or greater. In addition, the

 Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial found that there was a greater
risk of cardiovascular events despite tight glycemic control in
patients with longer diabetes duration.31,32 As a result, the
American Diabetes Association does not recommend aggres-
sive hyperglycemia management in those with longer dura-
tion of diabetes and suggests that the duration of diabetes be
considered when setting glycemic goals.33
Our analysis indicates that the presence and extent of
CAC are more associated with ASCVD risk than is diabetes
duration. Even among patients with long-standing diabetes,

 the absence of CAC was associated with similar low risk of
events as among those with shorter duration of diabetes.
Although diabetes is known to accelerate the aging process,
future studies need to focus on the factors that provide
resilience among patients with lack of subclinical disease
despite long-standing diabetes.
Ourresultsextendthefindingsofpriorpublications11,12that
have reported the clinical utility of CAC scoring, indicating that
after a decade of follow-up, there is no decrement in the NRI
among individuals without diabetes. Among those with diabe-
tes, when we compared CAC scores with FRS and PCE for prog-
nostication of long-term events, almost half of these individu-
als were reclassified to a different risk group. Yeboah et al34
reclassified CHD risk exclusively among those with diabetes af-
terafollow-upof8.5years,combiningdatafromasubsetofpar-
ticipantsinMESAandtheHeinzNixdorfRecallStudy,whoinad-
dition to CAC scoring had undergone assessment of carotid
intimalmediathickness,measurementofanklebrachialindex,
andC-reactiveproteintesting.TheirobservedNRIwas0.19de-
spiteuseofmoreprognosticindicatorsthanCACscorealonecom-
paredwithFRS,whichcouldbeattributabletotheshorterfollow-
upperiodrequiringestimationvsmeasurementof10-yearCHD
eventrates.Valentietal35alsoexaminedlong-termriskprognos-
ticationforall-causemortalityusingCACscoresin810individu-
als with diabetes from a single-site cohort. They reported a
category-free NRI for all-cause mortality of 0.50 to 0.53 among
thosewithdiabetes,whichissimilartoourresultsforCHDevents.
However, that analysis did not adjust for markers of diabetes
severity or duration.
Strengths and Limitations
Strengths of MESA include its large sample size, ethnic diver-
sity, and community-based recruitment. The prospective de-
sign provides information on the temporal association be-
tween the presence and extent of CAC and subsequent CHD
and ASCVD events. Limitations of our analysis include the lack
of data on diabetes duration for the entire diabetes group. In
addition, it was beyond the scope of our project to examine
theeffectsofCACprogressionortoconsidertheeffectsoftime-
varying covariates. Thus, our risk estimates relate to our base-
line measures only and do not consider the possible effects of
changes in CAC scores or other risk factors. Although the CAC
score increases invariably with time36 and more rapidly in in-
dividuals with vs without diabetes, with greater progression
portending additional risk as previously reported,37 baseline
CAC score appears to be more accurate for prediction of events
in persons with and without MetS and diabetes. In addition,
participants in MESA and their primary physicians were in-
formed of their CAC imaging results in a letter. It is possible
thatsuchinformationmayhavebiasedtheresultstowardfewer
incident events because of risk factor modification; however,
this bias would result in attenuation of our findings.38
Conclusions
Our results support the clinical utility of CAC scoring in those
with diabetes and MetS. Currently, CAC imaging has a class IIb
recommendation in the 2013 ASCVD risk assessment
guidelines.39 In addition, the Imaging Council of the American
College of Cardiology recently concluded that CAC screening is
the most sensitive noninvasive risk stratification tool among
asymptomaticpersonswithdiabetes.40Althoughscreeningfor
CHD in patients with diabetes has previously been found to not
be of benefit in reducing CHD and ASCVD events,41,42 other
reports43-45 have found that patient awareness of an abnormal
CAC score and coronary CT angiography results is associated
with increased adherence to preventive therapies, lifestyle
