Abstract
Background—Despite widespread implementation of compulsory treatment modalities for drug 
dependence, there has been no systematic evaluation of the scientific evidence on the effectiveness 
of compulsory drug treatment.
Methods—We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing the outcomes of compulsory 
treatment. We conducted a search in duplicate of all relevant peer-reviewed scientific literature 
evaluating compulsory treatment modalities. The following academic databases were searched: 
PubMed, PAIS International, Proquest, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Soc Abstracts, JSTOR, 
EBSCO/Academic Search Complete, REDALYC, SciELO Brazil. We also searched the Internet, 
and article reference lists, from database inception to July 15th, 2015. Eligibility criteria are as

 follows: peer-reviewed scientific studies presenting original data. Primary outcome of interest was 
post-treatment drug use. Secondary outcome of interest was post-treatment criminal recidivism.
Results—Of an initial 430 potential studies identified, nine quantitative studies met the inclusion 
criteria. Studies evaluated compulsory treatment options including drug detention facilities, short 
(i.e. 21-day) and long-term (i.e., 6 months) inpatient treatment, community-based treatment, 
group-based outpatient treatment, and prison-based treatment. Three studies (33%) reported no 
significant impacts of compulsory treatment compared with control interventions. Two studies 
(22%) found equivocal results but did not compare against a control condition. Two studies (22%) 
observed negative impacts of compulsory treatment on criminal recidivism. Two studies (22%) 
observed positive impacts of compulsory inpatient treatment on criminal recidivism and drug use.
Conclusion—There is limited scientific literature evaluating compulsory drug treatment. 
Evidence does not, on the whole, suggest improved outcomes related to compulsory treatment 
approaches, with some studies suggesting potential harms. Given the potential for human rights 
abuses within compulsory treatment settings, non-compulsory treatment modalities should be 
prioritized by policymakers seeking to reduce drug-related harms.
BACKGROUND
Globally, dependence to illicit and off-label drugs remains a key source of morbidity and 
mortality, and is implicated in criminal recidivism. For instance, 1.7 million of the world’s 
estimated 13 million people who inject drugs (PWID) are believed to be HIV-positive while 
more than 60% of PWID globally are estimated to be hepatitis C (HCV) positive.1 Illicit 
drug dependence is also estimated to have contribute to 20.0 million disability-adjusted life 
years in 2010,2 while, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated 
that there were as many as 231,400 drug-related deaths in 2013, the majority of which were 
the result of drug overdoses.1 Additionally, a UNODC review found that between 56% and 
90% of PWID reported imprisonment since initiating injection drug use.3
An increasing range of evidence-based treatment modalities have been found to be effective 
in improving outcomes from substance use disorder and attendant harms. For example, 
among individuals addicted to opioids, opioid substitution therapies (OST) including 
methadone and buprenorphine maintenance have been shown to reduce negative drug-
related outcomes and to stabilize individuals suffering from opioid dependence.4–6 In a 
recent review, use of Suboxone (a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone) was 
demonstrated to be effective for opioid withdrawal.7–10 Evidence of effectiveness for 
pharmacotherapies for stimulant use disorder remains mixed.11,12 However, a large set of 
psychosocial tools have shown promise for a range of substance use disorders.13–18
In many settings, compulsory treatment modalities have been in place or are being 
implemented. For instance, a recent international review found that as of 2009, 69% of a 
sample of countries (n = 104) had criminals laws allowing for compulsory drug treatment.19 
Compulsory drug treatment can be defined as the mandatory enrolment of individuals, who 
are often but not necessarily drug-dependent, in a drug treatment program.20 While most 
often consisting of forced inpatient treatment (i.e., individuals are placed under the care and 
supervision of treatment institutions), compulsory treatment can nevertheless be designed as

 outpatient treatment as well, either using an individualized treatment or group-based model 
that can include psychological assessment, medical consultation, and behavioral therapy to 
reduce substance use disorder.21 Compulsory drug treatment (particularly in inpatient 
settings) is often abstinence-based, and it is generally nested within a broader criminal 
justice-oriented response to drug-related harms.22 Compulsory treatment is distinct from 
coerced treatment, wherein individuals are provided with a choice, however narrow, to avoid 
treatment.23 Perhaps the most widely known example of coerced treatment is the drug 
treatment court model, which provides individuals charged with a drug-related crime with 
therapeutic measures in addition to criminal justice interventions under the auspices of the 
criminal justice system.24 While no systematic evaluation of the effectiveness of compulsory 
treatment approaches has been undertaken, observers have cited concerns regarding human 
rights violations within compulsory drug treatment centers.25,26 Further, while overviews as 
well as reviews on related topics (i.e., quasi-compulsory treatment) exist,27,28 no recent 
systematic assessments of the efficacy or effectiveness of compulsory or forced addiction 
treatment have been undertaken. This represents a critical gap in the literature given the 
implementation and scale up of compulsory treatment in a range of settings, including 
Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Australia.29–31
Observers have also noted that while the overall number of countries that employ 
compulsory drug treatment approaches is declining, the mean duration of care is increasing, 
as is the number of cases of individuals sentenced to compulsory drug treatment.19 
Relatedly, observers have expressed concern with evidence that compulsory treatment 
centers incorporate therapeutic approaches generally unsupported by scientific evidence, and 
employ punishment for individuals who relapse into drug use.29,32,33 Given the need for 
scientific evidence to inform effective approaches to drug treatment, we therefore undertook 
a systematic review of the effectiveness of compulsory drug treatment.
METHODS
We employed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) guidelines for the development of systematic reviews.34 A full review protocol is 
available by request to the corresponding author.
Eligibility criteria
Studies were eligible if they were peer-reviewed, and if they evaluated the impact of 
compulsory drug treatment on illicit drug-related outcomes. The primary outcome of interest 
was defined as the frequency of post-treatment drug use. The secondary outcome of interest 
was defined as any post-treatment drug-related criminal recidivism (i.e., post-treatment 
arrest or incarceration). Randomized control trials (RCTs) and observational studies were 
both eligible for inclusion. To be eligible, treatment interventions reported had to be 
compulsory; however, the type of intervention (e.g., inpatient abstinence-based therapy, 
outpatient group therapy, OST, etc.) could vary. Reviews as well as multi-component 
studies that did not disaggregate findings between components were not eligible if they did 
not provide specific data regarding the impact of compulsory treatment. Studies that 
assessed mandated treatment for legal or licit substances (i.e., alcohol, tobacco) were also

 not eligible. Further, studies that only evaluated outcomes such as attitudinal or psychosocial 
change, or psychological functioning related to substance use were excluded. Finally, 
studies that evaluated coerced or quasi-compulsory treatment (i.e., wherein individuals are 
provided with a choice between treatment and a punitive outcome such as incarceration such 
as a drug treatment court model) were excluded.
Information sources
We searched the following 10 electronic databases: Pubmed, EBSCOhost/Academic Search 
Complete, Cochrane Central, PAIS International/Proquest, JSTOR, PsycINFO, Soc 
Abstracts, Web of Science, REDALYC (Spanish language) and Scielo Brazil (Portuguese 
language). We also searched the internet (Google, Google Scholar), relevant academic 
conference abstract lists, and scanned the references of potentially eligible studies.
Search
We searched all English-, Spanish- and Portuguese-language studies and abstracts and set no 
date limits. The following search terms were used: “forced treatment,” “compulsory 
treatment,” “substance abuse,” “substance use,” “mandated treatment,” “mandatory 
treatment,” “addiction,” “addiction treatment,” “involuntary treatment,” “involuntary 
addiction treatment.” The terms were searched as keywords and mapped to database specific 
subject headings/controlled vocabulary terms when available, including MeSH terms for 
PubMed searches. Each database was searched from its inception to its most recent update 
as of June 15th, 2015.
Study selection
Two investigators (MM, CR) conducted the search independently and in duplicate using a 
predefined protocol. The investigators scanned all abstracts and obtained full texts of articles 
that potentially met the eligibility criteria. Validity was assessed in duplicate based on 
eligibility criteria. After all potentially eligible studies were collected, three investigators 
met to achieve consensus by comparing the two review datasets (MM, CR, DW). 
Differences were reviewed by three investigators (MM, CR, DW) and a final decision to 
include or exclude was then made.
Data extraction process
Between September 10th, 2014 and June 15th, 2015, data were extracted using a 
standardized form soliciting data on study design, setting, sample size, participant 
characteristics, type of compulsory intervention, measures of effectiveness, and study 
quality. Given the variance in study methodologies and treatment interventions, we extracted 
a range of summary measures, including difference in means, risk ratio, and odds ratio. The 
data were then entered into an electronic database.
Risk of publication bias
Compulsory drug treatment centers have been implemented or brought to scale in a number 
of settings, including Vietnam, China, and Brazil. However, these settings produce 
disproportionately less academic scholarship than other settings such as established market

 economies. For this reason, there is a potential risk of publication bias that may result in a 
smaller number of peer-reviewed evaluations of compulsory treatment in settings in which 
these interventions are more widely implemented. This may, in turn, affect the publication 
of studies relevant to the present systematic review.
Additional analyses
Study quality was assessed using the Downs & Black criteria by two authors independently 
(MM, CR).35 This scale evaluates five domains: reporting, external validity, risk of bias, 
confounding, and statistical power.
Given the wide variance in intervention design and reported outcomes, it was not feasible to 
perform a meta-analysis of findings.
Role of the funding source & Ethics Approval
This study was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Open 
Society Foundations. At no point did any external funder play a role in the collection, 
analyses, or interpretation of data, writing of the manuscript or decision to publish. All 
authors had complete access to all data, and all had final responsibility to submit the 
manuscript for publication. No ethics approval was required for this review.
RESULTS
Study selection and characteristics
Overall, as seen in Figure 1, 430 studies were initially identified, of which 378 were 
excluded because they did not present primary and/or specific data on compulsory treatment. 
Of the remaining 52 studies, 17 were excluded because they constituted reviews or 
editorials, 18 were excluded because they did not focus on illicit drug use (i.e., they focused 
on alcohol treatment), and 8 studies were excluded because they evaluated quasi-
compulsory treatment rather than compulsory treatment interventions. Nine studies met the 
inclusion criteria (combined n = 10,699). Three studies employed longitudinal observational 
approaches, four studies employed prospective case control designs, one study employed a 
cross-sectional design, and one study employed a quasi-experimental design. Six studies 
evaluated compulsory inpatient treatment or drug detention, one study evaluated prison/
detention-based treatment, and two studies evaluated compulsory community-based 
treatment.
Methodological quality assessment
The Downs & Black scale has a possible score of 0 to 18, with 18 being a perfect score 
(highest quality). The median score for eligible studies was 12 (Interquartile Range: 9.5 – 
15). All studies failed to undertake adequate steps to mitigate all risk of bias; eight studies 
(89%) did not optimally address risk of confounding, and five studies (56%) did not report 
all relevant study characteristics, methods, or findings. One study36 (11%) was only 
available as an abstract.

 Results of individual studies
Three studies reported no significant impacts of compulsory treatment on substance use 
compared with control interventions.36–38 Two studies found equivocal results but did not 
compare against a control condition (e.g., voluntary drug treatment).39,40 Two studies 
observed negative impacts of compulsory treatment on criminal recidivism.41,42 Two studies 
found positive outcomes: one study observed a small significant impact of compulsory 
inpatient treatment on criminal recidivism,43 and a retrospective study found improved drug 
use outcomes within the first week of release after treatment.40
Six studies evaluated compulsory inpatient treatment or drug detention.36–39,41,43 Huang and 
colleagues examined the impact of mandatory inpatient drug treatment on post-treatment 
drug use patterns over the period of a year among participants in Chongquing, China (n = 
177).41 As the authors note, Chinese police are given authority over mandatory drug 
treatment facilities, and have the power to detain individuals within these facilities for a 
period of weeks to several months.41 While the allocation of treatment varies by facility, 
treatment modalities commonly offered include “physical exercise, moral and legal 
education, drug and health education, and skill training (e.g., computer skills).”41 The 
authors do not, however, provide specific data on the content of any of these activities. The 
authors did not specify what type of treatment participants received, referring only to 
treatment and counseling. However, 46% of respondents reported using illicit drugs within a 
month to six months after release from mandatory treatment; a further 10% relapsed within 
one year.
Sun and colleagues compared relapse into drug use among a sample of heroin users in China 
(n = 615) enrolled in mandatory detoxification, volunteer detoxification, and detoxification 
with ‘re-education through labor’ (i.e., compulsory drug detention).36 Overall relapse within 
a year among the sample was 98%; 22% relapsed within three days, and 52% relapsed 
within one month. There was no significant difference between rates of relapse between 
sample participants enrolled in mandatory detoxification, volunteer detoxification, or 
detoxification in a compulsory drug detention center.36
Hiller and colleagues investigated the impact of a mandated six-month residential addiction 
treatment intervention on post-treatment criminal recidivism.43 Participants in Dallas, Texas 
(n = 506) were mandated to participate in a modified therapeutic community (TC), defined 
as addiction treatment provided within a controlled environment within which supervision is 
maximized.43 All participants were probationers or individuals arrested for drug-related 
crimes in Dallas county. Three groups were compared: a graduate group (n = 290; 
participants who successfully completed six months of the TC treatment process), a dropout 
group (n = 116; participants who failed to complete six months within the TC), and a 
comparison group (n = 100) comprised of a random sample of probationers from the Dallas 
county probationers list. The authors then compared the 1-year and 2-year incarceration 
rates across the three comparison groups, and found no significant differences after 1-year 
across all three groups (20% of the dropout group, 17% of the graduate group, and 13% of 
the comparison group were re-arrested and incarcerated; p > 0.05). The proportion of 
participants incarcerated within 2 years did not differ significantly between the graduate and

 comparison groups (21% vs. 23%, p > 0.05), though the dropout group had a significantly 
higher proportion of participants incarcerated compared with the other two groups (30%, p < 
0.05).43
Jansson and colleagues investigated the long-term impact of compulsory residential care 
among drug-using individuals in Sweden (n = 132).39 This included supervision and care 
from psychologists, a psychiatrist, nurses, social workers, and treatment attendants. Across 
642 observation years after compulsory residential care, 232 observation years (37%) 
included a criminal justice record, despite the fact that all participants were assigned to 
treatment.39 Further, in a longitudinal multivariate analysis, use of opiates was significantly 
associated with subsequent criminal recidivism.
A five-year longitudinal study compared treatment outcomes among American veterans 
across 15 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the United States (n = 2,095) who either had 
justice system involvement and were voluntarily enrolled in treatment (JSI); were mandated 
by the justice system to receive treatment (JSI-M); or had no involvement in the justice 
system and were enrolled in treatment (No-JSI).37 The treatment provided was an 
abstinence-based, 12-step program.44 Kelly and colleagues compared one- and five-year 
substance use and criminal recidivism outcomes among participants in each group and 
adjusted for a range of sociodemographic and dependence-related variables.37 The authors 
noted that the JSI-M (mandated) group had a significantly lower-risk clinical profile 
compared with the comparison groups at baseline, which necessitated adjustment via the 
multivariate analyses. After one year, participants in the JSI-M group had the highest 
reported level of abstinence from illicit drugs (61.0%), significantly higher than the JSI or 
No-JSI groups (48.1% vs. 43.8%, respectively).37 However, after five years no significant 
differences in the proportion of those in remission from drug use were detected across 
groups (JSI-M=45.4%; JSI=49.8%; No-JSI=46.4%).37 With respect to criminal recidivism, 
the JSI group reported a significantly higher proportion of individuals rearrested (32.3%) 
compared with the JSI-M or No-JSI groups (20.6% vs. 18.3%, respectively, p > 0.05). There 
were no significant differences in the proportion of participants rearrested after five years 
(JSI-M=23.6%; JSI=32.3%; No-JSI=18.3%). The authors concluded that, while JSI-M 
participants had a more favourable clinical profile at baseline, they did not have significantly 
improved therapeutic gains compared with the other groups after five years.37
Fairbairn and colleagues sought to determine whether detainment in a compulsory drug 
detention was associated with subsequent cessation of injection drug use among a sample of 
PWID in Bangkok (n = 422).38 Thailand has a large system of compulsory drug detention 
centers that seeks to promote drug abstinence through punishment, physical labor, and 
training among individuals charged with drug possession and other minor drug crimes.38 
Generally, detainees undergo a 45 day assessment period, followed by four months of 
detention and two months of vocational training.45 The authors found that 50% of 
participants reported a period of injection cessation of at least one year (i.e., ‘long term 
cessation’). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, incarceration and voluntary drug 
treatment were both associated with long-term cessation, though compulsory drug detention 
was only associated with short-term cessation (i.e., ceasing injection drug use for less than a

 year) and subsequent relapse into injecting.38 The authors concluded that strategies to 
promote long-term cessation are required to address ongoing relapse among Thai PWID.38
One study evaluated mandatory prison-based addiction treatment. Vaughn and colleagues 
evaluated Taiwan’s compulsory prison-based addiction treatment program.42 This program, 
implemented in 1997, required individuals arrested for illicit drug use to undergo a one-
month detoxification regime upon incarceration. At that point, a medical doctor determined 
whether offenders were drug dependent; such individuals were then sentenced to 12 months 
in prison and enrolment in a three-month drug abuse treatment program. The treatment was 
abstinence-based and included physical labor, psychological counseling, career planning, 
religious meditation, and civil education (no further details regarding the content of the 
psychological counseling, career planning, and civil education was provided by study 
authors). If offenders did not satisfactorily complete the program, they were forced to repeat 
it until successful completion.42 Once released, individuals were required to pay the cost of 
treatment. The authors employed a quasi-experimental design wherein individuals who 
undertook the three-month drug treatment program (n = 109) were compared with 
individuals who were not enrolled in the program as a result of being incarcerated prior to 
the program’s implementation (n = 99). Individuals were interviewed during pre-release and 
after 12 months of release from prison. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used 
to identify any significant differences in post-treatment drug use and criminal recidivism. 
The authors found that offenders enrolled in the mandatory prison-based drug treatment 
program were significantly more likely to engage in post-release drug use and criminal 
recidivism. As such, they concluded that Taiwan’s mandatory drug treatment system 
requires reform.42
Two studies evaluated mandatory outpatient or community-based treatment. Strauss and 
colleagues sought to determine the short-term impact of a compulsory community-based 
treatment intervention on substance use among a sample of drug-using female offenders in 
Portland, Oregon (n = 165).40 Participants were mandated to receive either treatment from 
‘ASAP’ (Alcohol and Substance Abuse Prevention Program) or VOA (Volunteers of 
America). Both programs are community-based treatment interventions that include both 
mandated and voluntary clients, and are intended to last six months. ASAP is an outpatient 
program that employs an abstinence-based approach with individual counseling sessions and 
therapeutic group sessions,40 while VOA provides a residential program focused on the 
therapeutic community model, with an emphasis on structured activities, individual 
counseling, and building skills to reduce domestic violence and abuse risk.40 In a 
retrospective analysis focused on the first week after release from treatment, the authors 
found that women offenders who were in treatment longer were less likely to use drugs 
within the first week.40
In 2003, the American state of Kansas implemented SB 123, a state senate bill legislating 
mandatory community-based treatment of up to 18 months for nonviolent offenders 
convicted of a first or second offense of drug possession.46 Rengifo and colleagues 
compared criminal recidivism among individuals convicted of drug possession who were 
mandated to treatment (n = 1,494) vs. those on regular probation, sent to court services, or 
sent to prison (n = 4,359), though they do not describe the community-based treatment that

 individuals received. Data were collected between 2001 and 2005. Findings suggested that 
there was no significant impact on criminal recidivism among participants mandated to 
treatment compared to those mandated to regular probation. Of concern, participants 
mandated to treatment had a significantly increased risk of criminal recidivism compared to 
participants mandated to court services. The authors concluded that offenders mandated to 
treatment were not recidivating at a lower rate compared with offenders in alternative 
programs.46
CONCLUSION
Summary of evidence
While a limited literature exists, the majority of studies (78%) evaluating compulsory 
treatment failed to detect any significant positive impacts on drug use or criminal recidivism 
over other approaches, with two studies (22%) detecting negative impacts of compulsory 
treatment on criminal recidivism compared with control arms. Further, only two studies 
(22%) observed a significant impact of long-term compulsory inpatient treatment on 
criminal recidivism: one reported a small effect size on recidivism after two years, and one 
found a lower risk of drug use within one week of release from compulsory treatment.40 As 
such, and in light of evidence regarding the potential for human rights violations within 
compulsory treatment settings, the results of this systematic review do not, on the whole, 
suggest improved outcomes in reducing drug use and criminal recidivism among drug-
dependent individuals enrolled in compulsory treatment approaches, with some studies 
suggesting potential harms.
These results are of high relevance given the reliance on compulsory drug detention among 
policymakers in a range of settings. Indeed, compulsory drug treatment approaches have 
been implemented in southeast Asia,29,45 the Russian Federation,47 North America,46 Latin 
America,30,47–49 Europe,39 Australia,31 and elsewhere.19 However, experts have noted that 
little evidence exists to support compulsory treatment modalities, and that the onus is 
therefore on advocates of such approaches to provide scientific evidence that compulsory 
treatment is effective, safe, and ethical.32 The results of the present systematic review, 
which fails to find sufficient evidence that compulsory drug treatment approaches are 
effective, appears to further confirm these statements.25 Human rights violations reported at 
compulsory drug detention centers include forced labour, physical and sexual abuse, and 
being held for up to five years without a clinical determination of drug 
dependence.25,29,33,45 Governments should therefore seek alternative, evidence-based 
policies to address drug dependence.
The evidence presented herein also supports the joint statement on drug detention centers 
released by a range of United Nations-affiliated institutions declaring that, “[t]here is no 
evidence that these centres represent a favorable or effective environment for the treatment 
of drug dependence”, and that “United Nations entities call on States to close compulsory 
drug detention and rehabilitation centres and implement voluntary, evidence-informed and 
rights-based health and social services in the community.”50 It is noteworthy in this regard 
that, while compulsory approaches appear ineffective, evidence suggests that a large body of 
scientific evidence supports the effectiveness of voluntary biomedical approaches such as

 OST in reducing drug-related harms.4,5 China, Vietnam and Malaysia, for example, all 
previously scaled up compulsory drug detention centers, but are increasingly moving 
towards voluntary methadone maintenance and needle and syringe distribution systems to 
reduce the risk of blood-borne disease transmission from PWID sharing injecting 
equipment.51–57 Emerging evidence suggests that expanded OST dispensation in these 
settings has been effective in reducing drug use.54,56–58 This scale up of evidence-based 
biomedical and harm reduction interventions is occurring despite China’s previous 
investment in a compulsory treatment infrastructure; as such, tensions remain between 
voluntary, public health-oriented approaches and compulsory detainment,59 as they do in 
settings that include both compulsory and voluntary approaches, such as Mexico.60,61 This 
may result in suboptimal treatment outcomes given that ongoing interactions with law 
enforcement and the threat of detainment within compulsory drug detention centers may 
cause drug-dependent individuals to avoid harm reduction services or engage in risky drug-
using behaviors out of a fear of being targeted by police,59 as has been observed in a range 
of settings.62–66 We also note that this is likely the case in settings seeking to control the 
harms of non-opioid substance use disorders such as cocaine use disorder, given that 
available interventions that have been shown to be effective have been undertaken using 
voluntary treatment approaches.11,12,16 Governments seeking to implement or bring to scale 
harm reduction interventions that include OST and needle and syringe distribution will 
therefore likely be required to reduce their reliance on compulsory and law enforcement-
based approaches in order to ensure treatment effectiveness.
Limitations
This systematic review has limitations. Primarily, risk of publication bias is present given 
political support for law enforcement-oriented strategies to controlling drug-related harms, 
particularly in Southeast Asia, where compulsory drug detention centers have been 
implemented by many national governments.29,45 In certain settings, such as Thailand, the 
scale up of drug detention centers has been accompanied by high-profile ‘war on drugs’ 
campaigns promoting enforcement- and military-based responses to drug harms.38 Within 
such political climates, undertaking or publishing peer-reviewed research critical of 
compulsory drug treatment may be disincentivized. Further, while drug detention centers are 
more numerous in southeast Asia, this region has a limited infrastructure for scientific 
research on drug use, which may also increase the risk of publication bias.
Conclusions
Based on the available peer-reviewed scientific literature, there is little evidence that 
compulsory drug treatment is effective in promoting abstention from drug use or in reducing 
criminal recidivism. It is noteworthy that this systematic review includes evaluations of not 
only drug detention centers, but of a range of compulsory inpatient and outpatient treatment 
approaches. Additionally, the reductions in drug use and criminal recidivism as a result of 
compulsory drug treatment interventions were generally short-term or of low clinical 
significance. In light of the lack of evidence suggesting that compulsory drug treatment is 
effective, policymakers should seek to implement evidence-based, voluntary treatment 
modalities in order to reduce the harms of drug use.
