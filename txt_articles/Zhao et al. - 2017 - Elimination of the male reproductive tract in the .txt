tract in the female embryo is
promoted by COUP-TFII in mice

The sexual differentiation paradigm contends that the female pattern of the reproductive
system is established by default because the male reproductive tracts (Wolffian ducts) in
the female degenerate owing to a lack of androgen. Here, we discovered that female mouse
embryos lacking Coup-tfII (chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor II) in
the Wolffian duct mesenchyme became intersex—possessing both female and male reproductive
tracts. Retention of Wolffian ducts was not caused by ectopic androgen production or action.
Instead, enhanced phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling in Wolffian duct
epithelium was responsible for the retention of male structures in an androgen-independent
manner.We thus suggest that elimination of Wolffian ducts in female embryos is actively
promoted by COUP-TFII, which suppresses a mesenchyme-epithelium cross-talk responsible for
Wolffian duct maintenance.
S
exually dimorphic establishment of repro-
ductive tracts epitomizes the anatomical
difference between males and females. This
dimorphic establishment depends on two
concurrent events during embryogenesis:
regression of one of the two primitive ducts
(Müllerian and Wolffian ducts) and maintenance
of the other. These two events ensure that the
embryo retains only one reproductive tract that
corresponds to its sex: Müllerian duct for the XX
individual and Wolffian duct for the XY individ-
ual (1). In the 1950s, Alfred Jost provided the first
evidence for what became the foundation of the
sexualdifferentiationparadigm: XY embryos retain
Wolffian ducts through the action of testis-derived
androgen,whereasXXembryosloseWolffianducts
as a result of a lack of androgens (2–5).
The action of androgen on the Wolffian duct
is mediated through androgen receptors in the
mesenchyme surrounding Wolffian ducts (6, 7).
It is well established that mesenchyme-derived
factors govern the fate and differentiation of duc-
tal epithelium (8). The orphan nuclear receptor
COUP-TFII (chicken ovalbumin upstream pro-
moter transcription factor II, or NR2F2) is a
mesenchyme-specific regulator in many devel-
oping organs, including the mesonephros, where
Wolffian ducts develop (9). COUP-TFII expres-
sion in Wolffian duct mesenchyme overlapped
with Wilms’ Tumor 1 (WT1) (fig. S1A), another
mesenchyme-specific transcriptional factor (10).
To investigate the role of COUP-TFII in Wolffian
duct regression, we used the tamoxifen-inducible
Wt1CreERT2 mouse model that targeted Coup-tfII
deletion in Wt1+ mesenchymal cells (fig. S1B).
In the control (Wt1CreERT2-;Coup-tfIIf/f) female,
COUP-TFII remained in the mesenchymal cells
of mesonephroi from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5)
to E16.5 (fig. S1, C to E), the developmental win-
dow that encompassed initiation (E14.5) and
completion (E16.5) of Wolffian duct regression
in XX embryos (fig. 2SA). In the knockout
(Wt1CreERT2+;Coup-tfIIf/f) female, COUP-TFII abla-
tion began 24 hours after the first tamoxifen
injection (fig. S1F) and was completed by E14.5
(fig. S1, G and H). Ablation of Coup-tfII was fur-
ther confirmed with reverse transcription poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (fig. S2B). These
results demonstrated an efficient ablation of Coup-
tfII in WT1-positive Wolffian duct mesenchyme in
XX embryos.
The impact of Coup-tfII ablation on XX
mesonephroi was first examined at E18.5, when
dimorphic development of reproductive tracts
is completed. The control XX embryos contained
only Müllerian ducts that were visualized by
immunostaining of the epithelial marker PAX2
(Fig. 1A). Other control genotypes that include
Wt1CreERT2+;Coup-tfIIf/+ and Wt1CreERT2+;Coup-
tfII+/+ female embryos also developed normally,
with only Müllerian ducts (fig. S3A). Knockout
XX littermates, however, had both Müllerian
and Wolffian ducts in the mesonephros (Fig. 1D).
The identity of the Wolffian duct was confirmed
by the presence of Wolffian duct epithelium
marker transcription factor AP-2a (AP-2a) (Fig. 1,
B and E) (7). Embryos in which Coup-tfII was
knocked out died soon after birth. We therefore
developed an organ culture system that allowed
us to maintain E18.5 XX mesonephros with
ovaries for 7 days to investigate whether Wolffian
ducts remained present postnatally. At the end
of culture, Wolffian ducts were still present in
knockout tissues, along with the components
of female reproductive tracts (Fig. 1, C and F),
indicating that Wolffian duct maintenance in
knockout XX persisted after birth and was not
a transient event.
Retention of Wolffian ducts in the Coup-tfII
knockout XX embryo points to a possible action
of androgens based on the Jost paradigm (11).
Wt1CreERT2 targets Coup-tfII deletion not only in
mesonephroi but also somatic cells of the ovary
(12), raising the possibility that an ovary in which
Coup-tfII has been knocked out could synthesize
androgens ectopically. We compared the tran-
scriptomes between control and knockout ovaries
at E14.5 and E16.5, during which Wolffian duct
regression occurs. The transcriptome of the knock-
out ovary was not different from the control ovary,
with the exception of 10 differentially expressed
genes (including Coup-tfII) (table S1). None of
these genes were associated with androgen
production. Furthermore, mRNA expression of
two rate-limiting enzymes—hydroxy-d-5-steroid
dehydrogenase, 3b- and steroid d-isomerase
1(Hsd3b1) and cytochrome P450 17A1 (Cyp17a1)—
for steroidogenesis was not different between
control and knockout ovaries and nearly un-
detectable compared with the wild-type fetal testis
(a positive control) (Fig. 2, A and B). A lack of
androgen-producing capacity in the ovary was
corroborated with unchanged anogenital dis-
tance (AGD), an androgen-sensitive parameter,
between control and knockout XX at E18.5 (Fig.
2C). To exclude the possibility that androgens
came from other resources in the knockout em-
bryo, we removed the mesonephroi from XX em-
bryos and cultured them for 4 days. After culture,
Wolffian ducts regressed in control XX meso-
nephros, as expected, whereas in knockout XX,
either in the presence or absence of ovaries,
Wolffian ducts were maintained (Fig. 2D and
fig. S3B). Theseresultsindicateda lack of androgen
production in the XX knockout ovaries and led
us to speculate that Wolffian duct retention in
XX embryos could be the result of ectopic activa-
tion of the androgen pathway in the absence of
Coup-tfII. This possibility was excluded based
on of the finding that expression of androgen
receptor (Ar) and two androgen-induced genes—
folate hydrolase 1 (Folh1) and solute carrier
family 26 member 3 (Slc26a3) (13, 14)—was not
different between control and knockout XX meso-
nephroi (Fig. 2, E to G). To rule out the involve-
ment of androgens, we exposed the dam that
carried control and knockout embryos to the an-
drogen antagonist flutamide (Fig. 2H) (15). This
regimen was sufficient to prevent Wolffian
duct maintenance resulting from ectopic andro-
gen action in XX embryos (16). Despite the verified
action of flutamide (fig. S4), Wolffian ducts were
still retained in knockout XX embryos (Fig. 2H).
Thus, the maintenance of Wolffian ducts in the
Coup-tfII knockout XX embryo is not due to ec-
topic production or action of androgens.
To identify the androgen-independent mech-
anism underlying Wolffian duct retention in the
female in which Coup-tfII had been knocked out,
we turned our attention to epidermal growth
factor (EGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
signaling pathways for their putative ability to
promote Wolffian duct maintenance (17, 18). We
first examined by means of RT-PCR the expres-
sion of Egf and its receptor Egfr. Their expression

 was not different between control and knockout
XX mesonephroi (fig. S5A). Components of FGF
signaling, in contrast, exhibited distinct changes
in the absence of Coup-tfII. FGFR2 is the major
FGF receptor in the Wolffian duct epithelium (19),
and its binding ligands include FGF1, -3, -7, -10,
-21, and -22 (20). mRNA expression of FGF re-
ceptors (Fgfr1, Fgfr2-b, and Fgfr2-c) and most
ligands were unaltered (Fgf1 and Fgf3) or un-
detectable (Fgf21 and Fgf22) in knockout XX
mesonephroi compared with the control (Fig. 3A).
However, expression of Fgf7 and Fgf10 was in-
creased significantly in knockout XX mesonephroi
at E14.5 (Fig. 3A) and E16.5 (fig. S5B). To inves-
tigate whether FGF7 and FGF10 were capable of
reproducing the Wolffian duct maintenance phe-
notype in the wild-type female, we cultured E14.5
wild-type XX mesonephroi for 2 days in the pres-
ence of vehicle, FGF7, FGF10, or FGF7+FGF10. In
the vehicle-treated group, Wolffian ducts regressed
after 2-day culture, similar to the in vivo sit-
uation. In contrast, presence of FGF7, FGF10, or
FGF7+FGF10 maintained the Wolffian duct in
the wild-type XX mesonephroi (Fig. 3B).
FGF7 and FGF10 are expressed in the meso-
nephric mesenchyme, the same cellular compart-
ment as COUP-TFII (21, 22). These FGFs bind
FGFR2 in Wolffian duct epithelium and activate
two intracellular signaling components, phospho-
rylated protein kinase B (p-AKT) and phosphoryl-
ated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK)
(20). Loss of Coup-tfII did not change p-AKT ac-
tivation in Wolffian ducts (fig. S5C). The presence
of p-ERK, conversely, became detected in Wolffian
duct epithelium of knockout XX compared with
the control XX at E14.5 (Fig. 3C) and E16.5
(fig. S5D). These results indicate that loss of
mesenchymal Coup-tfII led to an enhanced activ-
ity of p-ERK signaling in Wolffian duct epithelium.
We then tested whether elevated p-ERK signal-
ing was the cause of Wolffian duct maintenance
by culturing the Coup-tfII knockout mesonephroi
with a p-ERK specific inhibitor PD0325901 (23). In
the vehicle-treated group, Wolffian ducts in the
knockout XX were maintained in culture. Con-
versely, the p-ERK inhibitor eliminated Wolffian
ducts in the knockout XX mesonephroi (Fig. 3D),
indicating that enhanced p-ERK signaling was
involved in Wolffian duct retention in the Coup-
tfII knockout XX embryo.
We have shown that instead of a passive pro-
cess occurring as a result of the absence of an-
drogens, elimination of the male reproductive
tract in the female embryo is actively promoted
by COUP-TFII through its action in the Wolffian
duct mesenchyme. COUP-TFII in the mesenchyme
inhibits expression of FGFs, which otherwise
activate the p-ERK pathway in the Wolffian duct
epithelium for its maintenance. The function of
COUP-TFII in facilitating Wolffian duct elimina-
tion is not restricted to XX embryos; when the
testis was removed from the Coup-tfII knockout
XY mesonephros, Wolffian ducts remained pre-
sent despite a lack of androgens (fig. S6). These
findings reveal unexpected mechanisms under-
lying the dimorphic development of the Wolffian
ducts via COUP-TFII. In addition, maintenance
of male reproductive tracts without androgens
prompts a reassessment of the role of androgens
in this process, which presumably is to antagonize
the action of COUP-TFII.
