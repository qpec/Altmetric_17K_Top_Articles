Abstract
Cancer cells are characterized by aberrant epigenetic landscapes and often exploit chromatin 
machinery to activate oncogenic gene expression programs1. Recognition of modified histones by 
“reader” proteins constitutes a key mechanism underlying these processes; therefore, targeting 
such pathways holds clinical promise, as exemplified by the development of BET bromodomain 
inhibitors2, 3. We recently identified the YEATS domain as a novel acetyllysine-binding module4, 
yet its functional importance in human cancer remains unknown. Here we show that the YEATS 
domain-containing protein ENL, but not its paralog AF9, is required for disease maintenance in 
acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). CRISPR-Cas9 mediated depletion of ENL led to anti-leukemic 
effects, including increased terminal myeloid differentiation and suppression of leukaemia growth 
in vitro and in vivo. Biochemical and crystal structural studies and ChIP-seq analyses revealed that 
ENL binds to acetylated histone H3, and colocalizes with H3K27ac and H3K9ac on the promoters 
of actively transcribed genes that are essential for leukaemias. Disrupting the interaction between 
the YEATS domain and histone acetylation via structure-based mutagenesis reduced RNA 
polymerase II recruitment to ENL target genes, leading to suppression of oncogenic gene 
expression programs. Importantly, disruption of ENL’s functionality further sensitized leukaemia 
cells to BET inhibitors. Together, our study identifies ENL as a histone acetylation reader that 
regulates oncogenic transcriptional programs in AML and suggests that displacement of ENL from 
chromatin may be a promising epigenetic therapy alone or in combination with BET inhibitors for 
AML.
The YEATS domain-containing proteins AF9 and ENL are frequently fused with the MLL 
(mixed lineage leukaemia) protein as a result of MLL chromosomal translocations. The 
resultant fusion proteins are oncogenic drivers in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute 
lymphoid leukaemia (ALL)5. To assess the functional importance of the wild-type allele of 
AF9 and ENL in MLL-rearranged leukaemias, we employed a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene 
editing and negative selection strategy (Fig. 1a). Cells expressing ENL sgRNAs were 
outcompeted by non-transduced cells in various MLL-rearranged leukaemia cells, whereas 
sgRNAs targeting AF9 had little effect on cell growth (Fig. 1a and Extended Data Fig. 1a–
d). Using a clonal MOLM-13 cell line in which Cas9 expression can be induced with 
doxycycline (Dox) administration (iCas9-MOLM-13), we observed a consistent effect of 
ENL sgRNAs on cell growth after Dox treatment (Extended Data Fig. 1e–g). CRISPR-Cas9 
or shRNA-mediated depletion of ENL also impaired the clonogenic potential of MOLM-13 
(Fig. 1b) and MV4;11 (Extended Data Fig. 1h, i) cells grown in cytokine-supplemented 
methylcellulose. ENL depletion increased surface expression of Integrin alpha M (ITGAM 
or CD11b), a myeloid differentiation marker (Fig. 1c) and induced a morphological change

 to a macrophage-like appearance (Extended Data Fig. 1j). Importantly, ENL sgRNA-induced 
growth inhibition and differentiation were rescued by the presence of a mouse Enl cDNA 
that contains several mismatches with the human ENL sgRNA (Fig. 1d and Extended Data 
Fig. 1k). In addition to MLL-rearranged leukaemias, ENL depletion also suppressed the 
growth of non MLL-rearranged leukaemia cell lines such as U-937 and K562, but not the 
human cervical adenocarcinoma HeLa cells and human osteosarcoma U2OS cells (Extended 
Data Fig. 1l–o). ENL silencing also had minimal effect on the growth, colony-forming 
ability or differentiation potential of sorted lineage−Sca-1+c-Kit+ (LSK) cells that are 
enriched for hematopoietic stem cells (Extended Data Fig. 1p–r).
To examine the relevance of ENL and AF9 to leukaemia progression in vivo, MOLM-13 
cells were transduced with different sgRNAs and transplanted into immune-deficient 
recipient mice. The expression of ENL sgRNA resulted in a marked delay in leukaemia 
progression (Fig. 1e and Extended Data Fig. 2a) and prolonged survival of the recipient mice 
(Fig. 1f). Although the terminal leukaemia in the ENL-sgRNA group was composed of 
predominantly sgRNA-positive cells, these leukaemia cells had similar protein levels of 
ENL compared to those from the control group (Extended Data Fig. 2b, c), indicating that 
the mice succumbed to an outgrowth of cells that escaped ENL depletion. Together, these 
results suggest a critical requirement of ENL, but not AF9, for AML maintenance in vitro 
and in vivo.
To identify the transcriptional pathways controlled by ENL, we performed RNA-seq 
analyses on iCas9-MOLM-13 cells expressing different sgRNAs. While AF9 sgRNA caused 
minimal changes in gene expression, ENL sgRNA induction led to differential expression of 
a subset of genes, but not to global transcriptional dysregulation (Fig. 2a and Extended Data 
Fig. 3a). The transcriptional programs altered by the two ENL sgRNAs were highly 
correlated (Extended Data Fig. 3b). Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) revealed a 
marked upregulation of myeloid lineage differentiation signature along with a 
downregulation of a leukaemia stem cell (LSC) and MYC-associated gene expression 
signature6 in ENL sgRNA-expressing MOLM-13 and MV4;11 cells (Fig. 2b and Extended 
Data Fig. 3c–h), suggesting that ENL is required to sustain the oncogenic gene expression 
programs critical for leukaemia maintenance.
ENL resides in large protein complexes termed the super elongation complex (SEC)7, 
elongation assisting proteins (EAP)8 or AF4/ENL/P-TEFb complex (AEP)9 that contain 
overlapping subunits including AFF1/4, ELL, EAF1/2, ENL/AF9 and P-TEFb (for 
simplicity, we use the term SEC hereafter). To determine the genomic distribution of ENL, 
we generated stable MOLM-13 and MV4;11 cells ectopically expressing Flag-ENL at levels 
equivalent to the endogenous ENL proteins, and performed ChIP-seq experiments. ENL 
bound to a larger cohort of genes than that of MLL-fusion proteins in both cell lines, 
suggesting a broader role of ENL than MLL-fusion proteins in transcriptional regulation 
(Extended Data Fig. 4a, b). There was a greater overlap of ENL-bound genes between the 
leukaemia cell lines than their overlaps with ENL occupancy in the non-leukaemia HeLa 
cells (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Notably, the ENL-bound genes specific in leukaemia cell lines 
were significantly enriched in pathways implicated in cancer and hematological disease 
(Extended Data Fig. 4d).

 ENL ChIP-seq peaks showed a strong enrichment at promoter regions (TSS±3kb) (Fig. 2c 
and Extended Data Fig. 4e), which overlapped with the promoter-proximal RNA polymerase 
II (Pol II) peak (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4f). ENL-bound genes showed a much 
higher Pol II occupancy than non-ENL genes (Fig. 2e). Upon ENL depletion, Pol II ChIP-
seq signals decreased more prominently on ENL-occupied genes than on non-ENL bound 
genes (P < 0.0001), including two key transcription factors in AML MYC and H2.0-like 
homeobox (HLX)10 (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 4g, h). The reduction of Pol II 
occupancy spanned from the promoter proximal region to the 3′ end of gene body, 
suggesting reduced Pol II activities in both transcriptional initiation and elongation. Indeed, 
ChIP-seq of the elongation-specific Pol II that is phosphorylated at serine 2 (S2P)11 showed 
a markedly decreased occupancy of the elongating Pol II on ENL target genes in ENL-
depleted cells (Fig. 2f and Extended Data Fig. 4i). In addition, ENL depletion also resulted 
in decrease in the occupancy of CDK9, a SEC component12 that phosphorylates Pol II at the 
serine 2 site13, and the DOT1L-mediated H3K79me2 and H3K79me3 on ENL-target genes 
(Fig. 2g and Extended Data Fig. 4j, k). Together, these data suggest that ENL regulates gene 
expression by modulating the recruitment of Pol II likely through both the SEC and DOT1L 
complexes.
In light of the AF9 YEATS domain being a reader for histone acetylation4, we hypothesized 
that ENL might link the Pol II transcriptional machinery to chromatin through its YEATS 
domain. To test this hypothesis, we performed histone peptide array screening and found 
that indeed the ENL YEATS domain bound specifically to a subset of acetylated histone H3 
peptides (Extended Data Fig. 5a). Preferential binding to the H3K27ac, H3K9ac and 
H3K18ac peptides was further confirmed by peptide pull-down (Fig. 3a) and quantitative 
isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) assays (Fig. 3b) with a binding KD of 30.5, 32.2 and 
50.0 μM for H3K27ac, H3K9ac and H3K18ac, respectively. To explore the underlying 
molecular basis of this binding specificity, we solved the co-crystal structure of human ENL 
YEATS bound to H3K27ac peptide at 2.7 Å (Extended Data Table 1). The ENL YEATS 
domain adopts an eight-stranded β-sandwich fold (Fig. 3c) with the H3K27ac peptide snugly 
attached to an acidic surface at the top (Fig. 3d) and the flat acetylamide group of K27ac 
sandwiched by aromatic residues F59 and Y78 (Fig. 3e). Recognition of the H3K27ac 
peptide is further stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds in addition to hydrophobic 
contacts (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Acetylated histone H3 at K9, K18 and K27 share a 
common “R-Kac” recognition signature, in which the “−1” arginine forms a charge-
stabilized hydrogen bond with D103 of ENL (Fig. 3e). Structure-based mutagenesis 
followed by ITC titrations and peptide pull-down assays revealed a 2.3- to > 17-fold affinity 
drop or binding elimination upon alanine mutation of the “R-Kac”-binding residues (Fig. 3f, 
g).
ChIP-seq analyses of both MOLM-13 and MV4;11 cells revealed that ENL-bound peaks 
were associated with regions of H3K9ac or H3K27ac modifications (Fig. 3h and Extended 
Data Fig. 6a). Consistently, the average distribution of ENL correlated extremely well with 
that of H3K9ac and H3K27ac in the region immediately downstream of the TSS (Fig. 3i and 
Extended Data Fig. 6b, c). Importantly, compared to wild-type (WT) ENL, the YEATS 
domain mutants deficient in acetyl-binding exhibited markedly reduced occupancy at ENL-
bound genes (Fig. 3j and Extended Data Fig. 6d–f), whereas their interactions with other

 SEC components were not affected (Extended Data Fig. 6g, h). The ENL YEATS domain is 
also required for Pol II recruitment, as cells expressing the YEATS mutants exhibited 
reduced Pol II occupancy on ENL target genes such as MYC (Extended Data Fig. 6i). 
Together, these findings revealed an important “reader” function of the YEATS domain in 
mediating ENL’s chromatin localization and the recruitment of the Pol II transcriptional 
machinery.
To test whether the YEATS domain is required for ENL-dependent maintenance of 
oncogenic gene expression in leukaemias, we performed rescue experiments with 
ectopically expressed murine WT or mutant ENL proteins in cells expressing a human ENL 
sgRNA. Transcriptional profiling analyses revealed that WT ENL, but not the F59A or 
Y78A mutant, restored the transcriptional changes caused by the ENL sgRNA (Fig. 4a). 
GSEA analyses further demonstrated the incompetency of these ENL mutants to revert the 
effect of ENL depletion on the expression of genes involved in critical cellular processes 
(Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 7a). Consequently, the mutants were unable to rescue the 
growth and differentiation defects caused by ENL inhibition (Fig. 4c, d and Extended Data 
Fig. 7b). In line with these observations, replacement of ENL YEATS domain with that of 
AF9 retained the full functionality of ENL (Extended Data Fig. 7c, d). Finally, mice 
transplanted with ENL sgRNA-transduced cells expressing mutant ENL proteins exhibited a 
marked decrease in leukaemia burden and prolonged survival as compared to the WT 
counterpart (Fig. 4e and Extended Data Fig. 7e). Taken together, these findings demonstrate 
a critical role of the ENL YEATS-histone acetylation interaction in regulating oncogenic 
gene expression and leukaemia maintenance.
Strategies to disrupt the interaction between acetylated histones and their reader proteins, 
such as the BET family of bromodomain-containing proteins, have been shown to be 
effective in clinical trials for treatment of a variety of cancers, including hematologic 
malignancies14. Interestingly, similar to ENL, BRD4 also associates with P-TEFb and 
modulates the Pol II transcriptional machinery to regulate key oncogenes such as MYC15. 
This finding raised the intriguing possibility that ENL and BRD4 might cooperate to sustain 
optimal oncogenic gene expression programs critical for leukaemias. In line with this 
speculation, depletion of ENL or other SEC components sensitized MOLM-13 cells to a 
BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ12 (Fig. 4f and Extended Data Fig. 8a). Importantly, point 
mutations disrupting the interaction between the ENL YEATS domain and histone 
acetylation were sufficient to confer cells with greater sensitivity to JQ1 (Fig. 4f). Increased 
JQ1 sensitivity by ENL silencing was also observed in a panel of leukaemia cell lines, but 
not in HeLa or U2OS cells (Extended Data Fig. 8b–d). Furthermore, ENL depletion coupled 
with JQ1 treatment resulted in a significant survival advantage compared with single 
treatments in vivo (Fig. 4g, h and Extended Data Fig. 8e). Mechanistically, ENL depletion 
markedly enhanced JQ1-induced transcriptional changes in MOLM-13 cells, including 
MYC (Fig. 4i, j and Extended Data Fig. 8f–i), inhibition of which has been shown to 
critically contribute to the sensitivity to BET inhibitors16,17. Together, these findings suggest 
that inhibition of ENL’s functionality is a potential therapeutic strategy to synergize with 
BET inhibitors.

 Cancer cells often co-opt chromatin regulatory pathways and the general transcriptional 
machinery to sustain the oncogenic state; hence chromatin and transcriptional regulators are 
being explored as promising candidate drug targets. Targeting epigenetic readers represents a 
new class of anti-cancer therapy that holds clinical promise. Our study reveals ENL as a 
chromatin reader that regulates oncogenic programs through linking histone acetylation and 
the transcription apparatus in AML, thus establishing the ENL YEATS domain as a potential 
drug target, either alone or in combination with BET inhibitors. Interestingly, recurrent 
mutations in the ENL YEATS domain were recently reported in Wilms Tumors18, 
suggesting potentially critical and broad roles of the “reader” function of ENL in other 
cancer types that warrant future investigations.

post infection.
Competitive proliferation assays using sgRNAs: for constitutive Cas9 expression, cells were 
analyzed for RFP+ expression 3 days post infection. For Dox-regulated Cas9 expression 
cells, cells were analyzed for RFP+ expression before and after Dox treatment (1 μg ml−1). 
The percentage of sgRNA‐expressing cells (RFP+) was measured over time using flow 
cytometry and normalized to the starting time point.
Colony-forming assays were performed in Methocult (StemCell Technologies, No. H4435 
for human leukaemia cells and Cat. No. M3234 supplemented with 20 ng/ml mouse SCF, 10 
ng/ml mouse IL-3 and 10 ng/ml mouse IL-6 for murine LSKs). Indicated number of cells

For flow cytometry immunophenotyping, cultured or freshly dissociated cells were collected 
and stained using the indicated antibodies. Stained samples were analyzed on an LSR 
Fortessa (BD) flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed using FlowJo software.
Antibodies
All antibodies used are provided in Supplementary Information: Table S12. Antibody.
qRT-PCR analyses
Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed with the high 
capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) in accordance with the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative PCR was performed using the SYBR Green PCR 
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with the StepOne™ System (Applied Biosystems). qPCR 
primers used are provided in Supplementary Information: Table S11. Oligo.
RNA sequencing
RNA was isolated from human leukaemia cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, 
Gaithersburg, MD) and then samples were prepared as instructed using the TruSeq RNA 
Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s

or C6 oncogenic signatures) or were manually curated from published dataset. A detailed 
description of GSEA methodology and interpretation can be found at http://
www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/doc/GSEAUserGuideFrame.html. Normalized RNA-seq data 
were rank-ordered by expression fold change. Enrichment cores are defined as the members 
of the gene set that lie before or at the running sum peak (i. e. the enrichment score) of the 
ranked gene list. The normalized enrichment score (NES) provides “the degree to which a 
gene set is overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes”. The nominal P 
value (Nom p-val) describes “the statistical significance of the enrichment score”. The false 
discovery rate q value (FDR q-val) is “the estimated probability that a gene set with a given 
NES represents a false positive finding”. All gene sets used in this study are provided in 
Supplementary information: Table S13. GSEA gene sets.
ChIP and ChIP-seq analysis
ChIP analysis was performed essentially as described previously4. Briefly, cells were cross-
linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and stopped with 125 mM glycine. The isolated 
nuclei were resuspended in nuclei lysis buffer and sonicated using a Bioruptor Sonicator 
(Diagenode). The samples were immunoprecipitated with 2–4 μg of the appropriate 
antibodies overnight at 4°C. Protein A/G beads (Millipore) were added and incubated for 15 
min, and the immunoprecipitates were washed twice, each with low salt, high salt and LiCl 
buffer. Eluted DNA was reverse-crosslinked, purified using PCR purification kit (Qiagen), 
and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR on the ABI 7500-FAST System using the Power 
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems).
ChIP-seq samples were sequenced using the Illumina Solexa Hiseq 2000 or NextSeq 500. 
The raw reads were mapped to human reference genome NCBI 36 (hg19) by Solexa data 
processing pipeline, allowing up to 2 mismatches. The genome ChIP-seq profiles were 
generated using MACS 1.3.6 with only unique mapped reads24. Clonal reads were 
automatically removed by MACS. The ChIP-seq profiles were normalized to 20,000,000 
total tag numbers, and peaks were called at p-values ≤1×10−8. Peaks within 1kbp 
neighborhood were merged together across multiple samples in the peak overlap analysis.
Peptide microarray and peptide pull-down assay
Peptide microarray and peptide pull-down assays were performed as described previously25. 
Briefly, biotinylated histone peptides were printed in triplicate onto a streptavidin-coated 
slide (PolyAn) using a VersArray Compact Microarrayer (Bio-Rad). After a short blocking 
with biotin (Sigma), the slides were incubated with the GST-ENL YEATS domain in binding 
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF, 20% fetal bovine 
serum) overnight at 4°C with gentle agitation. After being washed with the same buffer, the 
slides were probed with an anti-GST primary antibody and then a fluorescein-conjugated 
secondary antibody and visualized using a GenePix 4000 scanner (Molecular Devices). For 
the peptide pull-down assays, 1 μg of biotinylated histone peptides with different 
modifications were incubated with 1–2 μg of GST-fused proteins in binding buffer (50 mM 
Tris-HCl 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM PMSF) overnight. Streptavidin beads 
(Amersham) were added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated for 1 hr with

 rotation. The beads were then washed three times and analyzed using SDS-PAGE and 
Western blotting.
Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)
Co-IP was performed essentially as described previously4. Cells were lysed in cell lysis 
buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% 
glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and a complete protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Antibodies 
conjugated with protein A/G beads (Millipore) or anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose beads 
(Sigma) were incubated with the lysates overnight at 4°C. The beads were then washed 3–6 
times with cell lysis buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted in SDS buffer and analyzed

ENL YEATS domain (1–148) and the mutants were recombinantly expressed in E. coli and 
purified as N-terminally His-Sumo-tagged proteins. After Ni column chromatography 
followed by ulp1 digestion for tag removal, ENL proteins were further purified via ion 
exchange and size-exclusion chromatography. Prior to crystallization, ENL sample was 
mixed with H315–39K27ac peptide in 1:2 molar ratio for about half an hour. Crystallization 
was performed under 4°C via vapor diffusion method under the condition: 0.2 M K/Na 
tartrate, 0.1 M sodium citrate tribasic dihydrate, pH 5.6 and 2M ammonium sulfate. 
Diffraction data were collected at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility BL17U under 
cryo-conditions. All structures were determined by molecular replacement and refined by 
the program PHENIX with iterative model building by the program COOT. Detailed data 
collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Extended Data Table 1.
ITC titration
All ITC titrations were performed under 15°C using a MicroCal iTC200 instrument. The 
titration curves were fitted according to the “One Set of Sites” binding model. A high salt 
titration buffer (500 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM β-ME) was used for ENL 
YEATS in order to avoid protein aggregation.
Animal experiments
All the mouse experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 
Committee (IACUC) at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the Dana-Farber 
Cancer Institute (DFCI). Leukaemia cells (iCas9-MOLM-13) were transplanted by tail-vein 
injection of 1 × 106 cells into sub-lethally (2 Gy) irradiated female NSG recipient mice at 
the age of 6–8 weeks (n = 10 per group). Dox-containing chow and water were supplied 
during the course of the experiments. For JQ1 ex vivo treatment trials, leukemia cells were 
treated with 1ug / ml doxycycline for two days and then treated with 100 nM JQ1 and 1ug / 
ml doxycycline for next two days before equal number of viable cells were transplanted. For 
JQ1 in vivo treatment trials, JQ1 was resuspended in DMSO at 200 mg / mL (for 50 mg/kg 
dosing) and then diluted 1:20 with 10.5% (2-hydroxypropyl)-beta-cyclodextrin in 0.9% 
sterile saline. The solution was sonicated until homogenous. Vehicle was prepared and 
administered the same with the exception that no JQ1 was added. 100 μL doses were

 administered by IP injection for 5 consecutive days with 2-day rest for 30 days starting from 
day 10 after transplantation. The animals were randomly assigned to the experimental 
groups. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of mice and the Log-rank test were performed using 
the Prism 6 software program (GraphPad). No animal was excluded from any of the 
analyses. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome 
assessment.
Statistical analyses
Experimental data are presented as means ± standard deviation of the mean unless stated 
otherwise. Statistical significance was calculated by two-tailed unpaired t-test on two 
experimental conditions with P < 0.05 considered statistically significant unless stated 
otherwise. Statistical significance levels are denoted as follows: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P 
< 0.001; ****P < 0.0001. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.
Data availability
Structure data has been deposited in Protein Data Bank under accession number 5J9S. The 
ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database 
under accession numbers GSE80779 and GSE80774, respectively. All other raw data

 expression in iCas9-MOLM-13 cells expressing ENL sgRNA and indicated murine Enl 
rescue constructs after 4 days of Dox treatment. See Extended Data Fig. 7b for 
quantification. n = 3. e, Kaplan-Meier survival curves of mice (n = 10 per group) 
transplanted with MOLM-13 cells transduced with indicated sgRNAs and rescue constructs. 
P < 0.0001 using a Log-rank test. f, Effect of JQ1 on the proliferation (normalized to DMSO 
control) of MOLM-13 cells transduced with indicated sgRNAs and rescue constructs. n = 5. 
g and h, Leukemia burden (g) and survival curves (h) of mice transplanted with iCas9-
MOLM-13 cells expressing indicated sgRNAs. Treatment with JQ1 (or vehicle control) and 
doxycycline was initiated at day 10 after transplantation. g, Percentage of human CD45+ 
cells in the peripheral blood of mice (n = 5) at 40 days after transplantation. P < 0.01 (ENL-
sg/JQ1 vs. all other groups) using Mann-Whitney test. h, Kaplan–Meier survival curves of 
control and JQ1-treated mice (n = 10 per group). P < 0.0001 (ENL-sg/JQ1 vs. all other 
groups) using a log rank test. i and j, RNA for RNA-seq experiments was obtained from 
sorted RFP+sgRNA+ iCas9-MOLM-13 cells treated with DMSO or 50 nM JQ1 for 24 hours. 
Genes found to be > 2-fold downregulated (i) or upregulated (j) upon JQ1 treatment in ENL 
sgRNA-expressing cells were examined. (Left) Boxplots comparing the JQ1-induced fold 
changes of these genes in either control (red) or ENL sgRNA-expressing cells (blue). Error 
bars indicate min to max. P = 2.29×10−7 (i) and P = 2.44×10−7 (j) by two-tailed paired 
Student’s t-test. (right) Pie charts showing the categorization of these genes based on the 
relationship to ENL depletion. Genes whose absolute JQ1-induced fold change was > 1.2 
fold higher or lower in ENL sgRNA-expressing cells compared to control were classified as 
“enhanced by ENL-sg” (blue) and “decreased by ENL-sg” (green), respectively. There are 
significantly more genes falling into “enhanced by ENL-sg” group than “decreased by ENL-
sg” group (P < 0.0001 by Fisher’s exact test). More details shown in Supplementary Table 
S10. All error bars represent mean ± s.d. (n = 3) unless noted otherwise.
