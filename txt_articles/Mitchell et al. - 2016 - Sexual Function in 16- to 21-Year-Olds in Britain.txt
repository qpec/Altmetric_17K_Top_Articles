Purpose: Concern about young people’s sexuality is focused on the need to prevent harmful
outcomes such as sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancy. Although the benefit
of a broader perspective is recognized, data on other aspects of sexuality, particularly sexual
function, are scant. We sought to address this gap by measuring the population prevalence of
sexual function problems, help seeking, and avoidance of sex in young people.
Methods: A cross-sectional stratified probability sample survey (Natsal-3) of 15,162 women and
men in Britain (response rate: 57.7%), using computer-assisted self-interviews. Data come from
1875 (71.9%) sexually active, and 517 sexually inactive (18.7%), participants aged 16e21 years.
Measures were single items from a validated measure of sexual function (the Natsal-SF).
Results: Among sexually active 16- to 21-year-old participants, 9.1% of men and 13.4% of women
reported a distressing sexual problem lasting 3 months or more in the last year. Most common
among men was reaching a climax too quickly (4.5%), and among women was difficulty in reaching
climax (6.3%). Just over a third (35.5%) of men and 42.3% of women reporting a problem had sought
help, but rarely from professional sources. Among those who had not had sex in the last year, just
>10% of young men and women said they had avoided sex because of sexual difficulties.
Conclusions: Distressing sexual function problems are reported by a sizeable minority of sexually
active young people. Education is required, and counseling should be available, to prevent lack of
knowledge, anxiety, and shame progressing into lifelong sexual difficulties.

IMPLICATIONS AND
CONTRIBUTION
This nationally represen-
tative data from Britain
shows
that
distressing
sexual function problems
are
not
uncommon
in
young people (aged 16e21
years). In sex education
and sexual health services,
professionals
need
to
acknowledge the impor-
tance of sexual well-being
and provide opportunities
for young people to raise
and discuss their concerns.
Professional interest in young people’s sexual behavior is
most often driven by concern to prevent the harms of sex, pri-
marily unplanned pregnancy and sexually transmitted infection
(STI) transmission [1e3] and, increasingly, nonconsensual sex.
Qualitative work suggests that young people themselves are
equally concerned with issues affecting their sexual well-being.
They may be anxious about their sexual orientation or identity
[4], feel social pressure to consent to activities they dislike or find
painful [5], or struggle against norms that make it difficult to
admit to experiences that are less than ideal [6,7].
While issues around volition, sexual identity, and sexual
reputation have been quite well documented, less is known

 about problems young people might have with sexual response
and function. This is partly because sexual function problems are
assumed to be more relevant to older adults. Sexual function is
defined as an individual’s ability to respond sexually or to
experience sexual pleasure [8] and sexual function problems are
those that interfere with these. Population prevalence studies of
sexual function problems typically include participants as young
as 16 or 18 years, but often use broad age categories, up to
29 years [9] and rarely provide specific detail on young people
under 24 years [10e12]. Few studies have focused specifically on
early adulthood, and these have not generally used nationally
representative data [13,14].
There is increasing recognition that sexual health should be
considered broadly [15,16], and the holistic definition endorsed
by WHOd“a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-
being in relation to sexuality” [17]dis steadily gaining currency.
In young people, sexual health includes “positive developmental
contributions of sexuality, as well as the acquisition of skills
pertinent to avoiding adverse sexual outcomes” [18]. There is
evidence that goals relating to sexual satisfaction and pleasure
shape both risk taking and risk-reduction practices [16,19]. For
instance, fears about erectile functioning among young men have
been shown to contribute to resistance to condom use [20] and
to inconsistent use [21]. Good sexual health in adolescents is
associated with risk reduction behaviors, such as condom use
and sexual abstinence [18], and sexual function in adults is
inversely associated with risk behavior [22]. Interventions that
safeguard pleasure may therefore be more effective than those
that ignore this aspect [16,23]. The current lack of data on sexual
function in young people limits efforts to address sexual health
holistically and reinforces the belief that sexual function and
well-being are less relevant to prevention interventions target-
ing young people [1,24].
We have previously reported on the prevalence of sexual
function problems in adults aged 16e74 years using data from
the third National Survey of Sexual Attitudes and Lifestyles
(Natsal-3) [22]. Here, we use this same data set to address the
gap in empirical data on sexual function problems (including
those that cause distress), help seeking about one’s sex life, and
avoidance of sex because of problems, in young people aged
16e21 years in Britain.
Methods
Participants and procedure
We present data from 16- to 21-year-old participants in
Natsal-3, a stratified probability sample survey of 15,162 men and
women aged 16e74 years in Britain, interviewed between
September 2010 and August 2012. We focus on the early adult-
hood period and the early stages of sexual careers before young
people “settle” into longer term partnerships and sexual habits.
We used a multistage, clustered, and stratified probability sam-
ple design, with the U.K. Postcode Address File as the sampling
frame and postcode sectors (n ¼ 1,727) selected as a primary
sampling unit. Within each primary sampling unit, 30 or 36
addresses were selected at random, and within each household,
an eligible adult was selected using a Kish grid. After weighting
to adjust for unequal probabilities of selection, the Natsal-3
sample was broadly representative of the British population as
described by 2011 Census figures [25].
Participants were interviewed at home by a trained inter-
viewer, using a combination of computer-assisted face-to-face
and computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) for the more sensi-
tive questions. The interviewer was present and available to help
while participants completed the CASI but did not view answers.
At the end of the CASI sections, answers were “locked” into the
computer and were inaccessible to the interviewer. The inter-
view lasted for about an hour, and participants received £15 as a
token of appreciation. The survey instrument underwent thor-
ough cognitive testing and piloting [26].
The overall response rate was 57.7% of all eligible addresses
(64.8% among participants aged 16e44 years). The cooperation
rate (proportion of respondents at eligible addresses where
contact was made agreeing to take part in the survey) was 65.8%.
Details of the survey methodology are published elsewhere
[25,27]. Natsal-3 was approved by the Oxfordshire Research
Ethics Committee A. Participants provided oral consent for
interviews.
Outcome measures
Participants reporting vaginal, oral, or anal sex with one or
more partner in the past year were classified as “sexually active”
and asked whether they had experienced any of a list of eight
difficulties with their sex life lasting 3 months or longer in the
past year. These were lacked interest in having sex, lacked
enjoyment in sex, felt anxious during sex, felt physical pain as a
result of sex, felt no excitement or arousal during sex, did not
reach a climax (experience an orgasm) or took a long time to
reach a climax despite feeling excited or aroused, reached climax
(experienced an orgasm) more quickly than you would like, had
an uncomfortably dry vagina (asked of women only), and had
trouble getting or keeping an erection (asked of men only). For
each item, they endorsed (responded yes), participants were
then asked how they felt about the problem (response options:
not at all distressed; a little distressed; fairly distressed; very
distressed). We also asked how long they had experienced the
difficulty and how often symptoms occurred (data not presented
in this article).
All sexually experienced participants (those who had ever had
a sexual experience), regardless of their sexual activity in the last
year, were asked to appraise their sex life overall, including
whether they had avoided sex because of sexual difficulties
experienced by themselves or their partner (agree strongly,
agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, disagree strongly).
Participants agreeing strongly or agreeing were then presented
with the same list of problems and asked to indicate which, if
any, had caused them to avoid sex. Additional response options
were as follows: “my partner had one (or more) sexual difficulty”
and “none of these things caused me to avoid sex.” Multiple
responses were allowed. Participants were also asked if they
felt distressed or worried about their sex life using a five-point
Likert scale. Finally, participants were asked whether they had
sought help or advice regarding their sex life from any of a list of
sources in the last year, and if yes, to select all that apply. These
options were subsequently grouped as family member/friend,
media/self-help (includes information and support sites on the
internet; self-help books/information leaflets; self-help groups;
helpline), and professional (includes general practitioner/family
doctor; sexual health/genito-urinary medicine/STI clinic; psy-
chiatrist or psychologist; relationship counselor; other type of
clinic or doctor), or have not sought any help. These items come

 from the Natsal-SF; a measure of sexual function specifically
designed and validated for use in this and other population
prevalence surveys. The 17-item Natsal-SF measure has good fit
(comparative fit index ¼ .963; Tucker Lewis index ¼ .951; root
mean square error of approximation ¼ .064), can discriminate
between clinical and general population groups, and has good
testeretest reliability (r ¼ .72) [22,28].
Statistical analysis
All analyses were done using the complex survey functions of
Stata (version 12; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) to account for
the weighting, clustering, and stratification of the data. Analysis
was restricted to all sexually experienced men and women aged
16e21 years. Item nonresponse in Natsal-3 was low (almost
always <5%, and often 1%e3%), so patients with missing data
were excluded from analysis. Among sexually active participants
(those reporting at least one sexual partner in the year before
interview), we present descriptive statistics for reporting of
sexual function problems (lasting 3 or more months in the last
year), and the proportion distressed by their problem. We also
report the proportion seeking help from the range of sources,
stratified by reporting one or more sexual function problem.
For participants who were not sexually active in the last year,
we report descriptive statistics for three outcomes: sexual
satisfaction, distress about sex life, and avoidance of sex because
of a sexual difficulty.
Results
Most men and women (72%) aged 16e21 years reported
having one or more sexual partner in the last year and so were
categorized as sexually active (854 men and 1,021 women).
Table 1 shows the proportion of these men reporting each of
eight sexual function problems lasting 3 months or more in the
last year. A third of these men (33.8%) experienced one or
more sexual function problem (first column of Table 1), and 9.1%
reported one or more distressing sexual function problem(s)
(second column); implying that among men reporting one
or more problem, just over a quarter (26.9%) felt distressed
(third column).
Among men, reaching a climax too quickly was the most
common problem (13.2%). Just over a third of men with this
problem (34.2%) felt distressed about it, making it the most
common distressing problem among sexually active 16- to
21-year-old men (4.5%). Difficulty getting and keeping an erec-
tion was less commonly reported (7.8%), but more frequently
caused distress (among 42.1%) and was thus the second most
common distressing problem (by 3.3% of men in the age group).
Although lack of interest in sex was the second most commonly
reported problem (experienced by 10.5%), only 13.2% of men
reporting this problem were distressed by it, and overall, 1.4%
experienced it as a distressing problem. Three distressing prob-
lems were reported by <1% of sexually active young men: pain,
lacking excitement/arousal, and lacking enjoyment.
Table 2 shows the proportion of young sexually active women
reporting each sexual function problem, and of those experi-
encing the problem, the proportion distressed about it. Just
under half (44.4%) of these women experienced one or more
sexual function problem lasting 3 months or more in the last
year, and 13.4% reported a distressing problem; implying that of
those reporting one or more problem, just less than a third
(30.2%) were distressed.
The most common problems among women were lacking
interest in sex (22.0%) and experiencing difficulty in reaching
climax (21.3%), and these were also the most common distressing
problems (5.3% and 6.3%, respectively). The problems most
commonly associated with distress were feeling anxious during
sex (34.7%), feeling physical pain as a result of sex (35.9%), and
lacking excitement or arousal (31.6%), but these problems were
less frequently reported, resulting in overall prevalence esti-
mates for distressing problems at 2.8%, 3.2%, and 2.5%, respec-
tively. Reaching a climax too quickly was least commonly
reported (3.9%) and was experienced as distressing by only 10.8%
of women reporting it, resulting in overall prevalence for
distressing early climax of <1%.
Among young people who were sexually active in the last
year, 6.3% of men and 6.8% of women said that they had avoided
sex because of a sexual difficulty. Among young men (Figure 1),
the most common reasons for avoidance were difficulty getting
or keeping an erection, reaching a climax too quickly, and lack of
interest (reported by 26.1%, 24.4%, and 25.1%, respectively, of all

 young men who said they had avoided sex). Among young
women (Figure 1), the most common reasons for avoidance were
lack of interest (reported by 45.5% of women who had avoided
sex), followed by lack of enjoyment, anxiety, and pain (reported
by 21.2%, 25.3%, and 23.7%, respectively, of women who had
avoided sex).
Help or advice seeking among sexually active participants
Overall, 26% (22.9e29.5) of sexually active men and 36.3%
(33.1e39.7) of sexually active women had sought help about their
sex life in the last year (last row, Tables 1 and 2). Figure 2 shows the
proportions consulting the different sources, stratified by experi-
ence of sexual function problem. Those reporting one or more
problem more commonly sought help compared with those
reporting no problems (35.5% vs. 21% for men; p < .001 and 42.3%
vs. 31.1%; p ¼ .001). Where young people did seek help, family
members and friends were the most common source followed by
the media/self-help. Professionalhelp was leastcommonlysought.
Among young people reporting one or more sexual function
problem, 3.6% (1.9e6.8) of men and 7.9% (5.8e10.6) of women had
consulted professionals about their sex life in the last year.

 Distress and avoidance among young people who did not have sex
in the last year
In total, 262 men and 255 women were sexually experienced
(had ever had a sexual experience) but did not report having sex
in the year before interview (Table 3). Just over one in six of these
men (17.4%) and around one in eight of these women (12%) re-
ported being distressed about their sex life, and around one in 10
(10%) of men and women said they had avoided sex because of
sexual difficulties that either they or their partner experienced.
There was
no
gender difference
in
reporting
distress
or
avoidance.
Discussion
These nationally representative data show that approxi-
mately one in 10 sexually active young men and one in eight
sexually active young women report a distressing sexual prob-
lem lasting 3 months or more in the last year. The most
commonly reported distressing problem among all sexually
active men was reaching a climax too quickly (4.5%), and among
young women, was difficulty reaching climax (6.3%). Over a third
of men and more than four in 10 women reporting one or more
sexual function problem had sought help, but rarely from pro-
fessional sources. Among those who had not had sex in the year
before interview, one in 10 young men and women said they had
avoided sex because of sexual difficulties.
The strengths of this study are that it is based on a large
population-based probability sample and addresses an impor-
tant gap in the empirical evidence on sexual function problems
among the young. Although the response rate of the overall
survey (57.7%) represents a potential source of bias, the response
rate among 16- to 44-year-olds was higher, at 64.8%. We have
previously noted the recent general decline in survey response
rates, coupled with more stringent methods for calculating them,
and have also noted that our response rates are in line with other
major social surveys in United Kingdom [25,27]. Nonetheless,
systematic bias in agreement to participate is possible, and we
used survey weights to reduce this bias (see Methods). Items on
sexual problems are sensitive, and self-reported data may be
subject to recall bias and prone to under-reporting. We sought to
minimize reporting bias by describing sexual function problems
as “common difficulties” [22], by cognitively pretesting items
[28], and by using computer-assisted self-interviewing [25].
Our data show sexual function problems are not uncommon
in this age group. Estimates of the proportions of sexually active
16- to 21-year-old men and women reporting sexual function
problems are not much lower than for the entire Natsal-3 pop-
ulation, 41.6% for men and 51.2% for women [22]. Several
population-based
studies
have
included
and
reported
on
younger age groups [10e12,29] although comparison is limited
by variation in survey methodology and categorization of both
sexual problems and their severity. A recent Canadian study [13],
for example, found that 50% of sexually active 16- to 21-year-old
men and women reported a sexual problem, of whom, half
reported associated distress, although the small, nonrandom
sample and differences in definition suggest the need for caution
in interpretation. Among young men, our prevalence estimate for
erectile difficulties (7.8%) is midway between the 4.3% found in
an Australian study of sexually active 16- to 19-year-olds [10] and
11% among sexually active 16- to 24-year-olds in a study in
Portugal [12]. Our estimate of 13.2% for early ejaculation is
slightly lower than the Australian study (15.3%) and much lower
than the Portuguese study (40%). Among young women, our
prevalence estimates for lack of interest (22%) and difficulty in
reaching orgasm (21.3%) are slightly lower than those in the
Australian study (36.7% and 29%, respectively) and comparable
with rates of approximately 20% and 27% in a Swedish study of
women aged 18e24 years [11].
It has been suggested that a proportion of problems in young
people arise from a “practice effect” and that they disappear over
time as young people gain confidence and experience. In support
of this, O’Sullivan et al. [13] found that in young men, a longer
period of sexual experience was associated with better erectile
functioning and greater satisfaction with intercourse. On the
other hand, a proportion of adults with sexual function problems
report lifelong symptoms, in other words, symptoms that
appeared at or before time of their sexual debut and have not
subsided [8,30]. A number of factors contributing to sexual dif-
ficulties are typically shaped in childhood and adolescence.
These include inadequate sex education, difficulty in communi-
cating about sex, anxiety about one’s body or sexuality, and
confusion
or
shame
about
one’s
sexual
orientation
or
desires [31]. Sexual difficulties may also reflect the struggle to
achieve positive sexuality within the confines of restrictive and
gendered social norms, for instance, an acceptance that women
should expect and endure pain [5]. The sexual double standard
whereby women are censored and men rewarded for their

 sexual desire appears particularly resistant to cultural change
[32], although recent research suggests variation in the extent to
which young people assimilate these cultural scripts in their own
relationships [33].
Over 25 years since the essay by Fine and McClelland [34] on
the missing discourse of desire in sex education, young people
continue to perceive a gap in their knowledge relating to
psychosocial aspects of sex and often report feeling ill equipped
to manage sexual intimacy. Natsal-3 data suggest that 42% of
men and 47% of women wish they had known more about
psychosexual topics at the time they first felt ready to have sex,
including nearly 20% of men and 15% of women who wished they
had known how to make sex more satisfying [35]. Similarly, in a
mixed method study from New Zealand, students aged 16e19
years ranked “how to make sexual activity more enjoyable for
both partners” and “emotions in relationships” among the top
five topics they wished to know more about in school sex edu-
cation [24]. While young people say they want to talk about
pleasure, nonpenetrative alternatives to intercourse, and power
relations in sexual relationships, school sex education tends to
neglect these topics, the content instead reflecting the protec-
tionist concerns of adults in authority [36].
Calls for inclusion of pleasure in sex education are not
new [37]. The silence on sexual well-being from educative
sources is filled by other sources such as friends and media; and,
according to Natsal-3, nearly a quarter of young men cite
pornography as one of their sources of information about sex
[35]. Although some users perceive a positive impact on their
sex life [38], pornography may lead to unrealistic and harmful
expectations of sex among young men [39], potentially exacer-
bating sexual function problems. Sex education could do much
to debunk myths, discuss pleasure, promote gender equitable
relationships, and emphasize the key roles of communication
and respect within relationships to militate against sexual
problems.
The low proportion of young people with distressing prob-
lems who seek help or advice is perhaps unsurprising. Help
seeking is uncommon, even among adults with sexual function
problems [40]. Sex education could do much to address concerns,
(1) by meeting gaps in knowledge; (2) by reassuring young
people that problems are common and legitimate; and (3) by
strengthening links to youth friendly services. Providers, in turn,
need to be aware that young people attending for other sexual
health needs (such as contraception and STI testing) may be
struggling with concerns related to their sexual function. Given
the prevalence of these concerns, it may be appropriate for
providers to initiate discussion by asking about sexual function
within a standard patient history, and future studies might
evaluate the usefulness of this approach.
Without reliable data on young people’s sexual function and
well-being, calls for attention to this aspect of their sexual health
can only be speculative. There is a pressing need for further
youth-focused research exploring the scope of problems, their
etiology and ramifications. In particular, there is a need for valid
measurement tools that are specifically tailored to young
people’s issues.
In conclusion, if we wish to improve sexual well-being in the
population, we need to reach individuals and couples as they
embark on their sexual careers, to prevent lack of knowledge,
anxiety, and shame turning into lifelong sexual difficulties.
Our data provide a strong empirical impetus for taking this
preventive action.
