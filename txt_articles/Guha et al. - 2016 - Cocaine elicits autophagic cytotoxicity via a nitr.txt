Cocaine exerts its behavioral stimulant effects by facilitating synaptic
actions of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and serotonin. It is also
neurotoxic and broadly cytotoxic, leading to overdose deaths. We
demonstrate that the cytotoxic actions of cocaine reflect selective en-
hancement of autophagy, a process that physiologically degrades me-
tabolites and cellular organelles, and that uncontrolled autophagy can
also lead to cell death. In brain cultures, cocaine markedly increases
levels of LC3-II and depletes p62, both actions characteristic of auto-
phagy. By contrast, cocaine fails to stimulate cell death processes
reflecting parthanatos, monitored by cleavage of poly(ADP ribose)po-
lymerase-1 (PARP-1), or necroptosis, assessed by levels of phosphory-
lated mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein. Pharmacologic
inhibition of autophagy protects neurons against cocaine-induced cell
death. On the other hand, inhibition of parthanatos, necroptosis, or
apoptosis did not change cocaine cytotoxicity. Depletion of ATG5 or
beclin-1, major mediators of autophagy, prevents cocaine-induced cell
death. By contrast, depleting caspase-3, whose cleavage reflects apo-
ptosis, fails to alter cocaine cytotoxicity, and cocaine does not alter
caspase-3 cleavage. Moreover, depleting PARP-1 or RIPK1, key media-
tors of parthanatos and necroptosis, respectively, did not prevent co-
caine-induced cell death. Autophagic actions of cocaine are mediated
by the nitric oxide-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal-
ing pathway. Thus, cocaine-associated autophagy is abolished by de-
pleting GAPDH via shRNA; by the drug CGP3466B, which prevents
GAPDH nitrosylation; and by mutating cysteine-150 of GAPDH, its site
of nitrosylation. Treatments that selectively influence cocaine-associ-
ated autophagy may afford therapeutic benefit.

ocaine is a well recognized behavioral stimulant, which is
widely abused. Its behavioral effects are thought to reflect
inhibition of the reuptake inactivation of biogenic amines, es-
pecially serotonin and dopamine (1–4). Transcriptional regula-
tion may underlie long-term effects of cocaine, especially the
transition from abuse to addiction (5–12). Cocaine is also notably
neurotoxic and broadly cytotoxic, but mechanisms for such ac-
tions have not been well characterized. Diverse modes of cytotoxicity
and cell death have been delineated (13). Apoptosis is well estab-
lished as a programmed form of cell death (14, 15). Earlier work had
regarded necrosis as unprogrammed with cellular integrity disrupted
via diverse, seemingly random events. More recently programmed
modes of necrosis have been identified. Parthanatos reflects cell
death associated with activation of poly(ADP ribose)polymerase-1
(PARP-1) (16). In necroptosis, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)
typically activates Receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)
(17). Apoptosis is linked to a series of caspases (18–20). Autophagy
is a process wherein cells degrade diverse metabolic products (21).
Levine and associates (22, 23) delineated a mode of cell death
uniquely associated with autophagy, which was designated “autosis.”
Understanding the relationship of cocaine toxicity to one or more of
these signaling systems might afford novel strategies for treating
cocaine toxicity.
Recently we showed that behavioral effects of cocaine re-
flect a signaling cascade associated with nitric oxide (NO) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (24). Gen-
eration of NO is triggered by a variety of stimuli such as glutamate
neurotransmission acting via its N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
subtype receptors. The NO nitrosylates GAPDH at a critical cys-
teine, abolishing its catalytic activity but conferring upon it the
ability to bind to the ubiquitin E3 ligase Siah1. Nitrosylated
GAPDH associated with Siah1 translocates to the nucleus. With
cytotoxic insults nitrosylated GAPDH in the nucleus activates the
histone acetylating complex p300/CBP which leads to acetylation
and activation of p53 with associated enhancement of transcrip-
tional targets, such as PUMA and Bax, that mediate cell death (25,
26). By contrast, physiologic stimuli associated with neurotrophic
actions such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
nerve growth factor (NGF) lead to the nuclear GAPDH–Siah1
complex binding and degrading the histone-methylating enzyme
SUV39H1 (27). The diminished histone methylation is associated
with augmented histone acetylation with enhancement of cAMP
response element-binding protein (CREB)-regulated genes that
facilitate nerve outgrowth.
We described a signaling cascade in which the NO/GAPDH/Siah1
system accounts for behavioral stimulant effects of low doses of
cocaine as well as neurotoxic actions of high doses (24). The lower
doses of cocaine augment CREB genes, whereas higher, neurotoxic,
doses activate the cytotoxic p53 system. Evidence that both stimulant
and cytotoxic influences involve NO/GAPDH/Siah1 signaling is
provided by the use of the drug CGP3466B, an extremely potent
inhibitor of GAPDH nitrosylation as well as GAPDH-Siah1 binding,
which prevents both the stimulant and neurotoxic actions of cocaine
(24, 28).
Significance
Cocaine is one of the most abused drugs in modern society,
with overdoses that are frequently lethal. Molecular mecha-
nisms underlying its toxic actions have been obscure. The
present study demonstrates that cocaine’s cellular toxicity in-
volves a signaling cascade that utilizes the gasotransmitter
nitric oxide, which leads to autophagy, a cellular modification
that can cause cell death. Thus, manipulations that impair nitric
oxide signaling and autophagy diminish cytotoxic actions of
cocaine. By contrast, alterations of apoptosis and other non-
autophagic modes of cell death are ineffective. Therapies di-
rected toward the autophagic process may be beneficial in
treating cocaine neurotoxicity.

cocaine selectively elicits activation of autophagy, which uniquely
mediates cocaine’s cytotoxic actions.
Results
Cocaine Elicits Autophagy in Neuronal Systems. LC3 (microtubule-
associated protein 1 light chain-3) is the mammalian homolog of
the yeast protein Atg8, a well-characterized mediator of auto-
phagy (29). Mammalian autophagy is associated with the lip-
idation of LC3-I via the addition of phosphatidylethanolamine to
generate LC3-II (30, 31). Formation of LC3-II can be regarded
as an important marker for autophagy (32).
Treatment of primary neuronal cerebrocortical cultures with
cocaine markedly augments formation of LC3-II with a maximal
sevenfold increase and half-maximal effects at 1 μM (Fig. 1 A
and B). Bafilomycin facilitates monitoring autophagic flux by
increasing the pH of lysosomes, which prevents degradation of
autophagic vesicles and reduces variability (32). In the presence
of bafilomycin, cocaine enhances levels of LC3-II (Fig. 1C).
Because bafilomycin prevents degradation of autophagic vesi-
cles, these findings rule out the possibility that cocaine acts by

 altering the disposition of autophagic vesicles and establish that
cocaine acts by increasing autophagy.
We also examined p62, an adaptor protein that binds to ubiq-
uitylated proteins to facilitate their degradation via autophagy (32).
In the process, p62 itself is degraded, with this degradation repre-
senting a marker for the autophagic process. Cocaine (1–200 μM)
dramatically decreases protein levels of p62, which are virtually
evident even at 1 μM dose of cocaine (Fig. 1D).
To assess autophagy at a morphologic level, we monitored
LC3-II punctae by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1 F and G). We
observed substantial increases in such punctae following cocaine
treatment, further supporting autophagic actions of cocaine.
Electron microscopic analysis of cortical cultures further sup-
ports the autophagic actions of cocaine (Fig. 1H and Fig. S1A).
Numbers of autophagic vesicles are tripled by 10 μM cocaine and
increased sixfold at 100/200 μM cocaine (Fig. 1I). Detailed
morphologic examination reveals the double lamellar structure
characteristic of autophagic vesicles.
We extended our analysis to intact mouse brain. Previous re-
ports demonstrated neurotoxic effects of cocaine in the lateral
habenula (33, 34). In brains of adult mice treated with co-
caine, transmission electron microscopic analysis (TEM) reveals
a substantial increase in numbers of autophagic vesicles in the
lateral habenula (Fig. 1J). When pregnant mice were treated
with cocaine, considerable numbers of autophagic vesicles are
evident in the cerebral cortices of pups compared with pups of
control pregnant mice (Fig. 1K).
To substantiate microscopic data, we performed Western blot
analysis of LC3-II in different part of mice brain. As expected,
treatment of cocaine substantially induced LC3-II level in dorsal
striatum, cortex, lateral habenula, and nucleus accumbens com-
pared with vehicle treated group. (Fig. S1 B–E).
In summary, multiple lines of evidence, both biochemical and
morphologic, support an autophagic action of cocaine in neuronal
systems.
Autophagic Actions of Cocaine Involve GAPDH Nitrosylation. Earlier,
we reported that behavioral stimulant and neurotoxic actions of
cocaine depend upon a signaling system involving NO nitro-
sylating GAPDH (24). Here we show that this process also un-
derlies cocaine-associated autophagy.
In HEK-293 cells cocaine elicits autophagy monitored by the
generation of LC3-II. Concentrations of 250 μM cocaine have
been used, because HEK-293 cells are relatively insensitive to

 autophagic actions of cocaine. Depletion of GAPDH by shRNA
treatment (Fig. S2A) virtually abolishes the autophagic enhance-
ment of LC3-II elicited by cocaine (Fig. 2 A and B).
Our previous study linking GAPDH nitrosylation to cocaine’s
actions used intact mice (24). In the present study, we evaluated
cerebrocortical neuronal cultures, which differ notably from adult
rodent brain in lacking the dopamine and serotonin neuronal sys-
tems that are classically involved in psychotropoic influences of
cocaine. In these cultures, we demonstrate that cocaine (1–100 μM)
elicits GAPDH nitrosylation (Fig. 2C) as well as nuclear trans-
location of GAPDH (Fig. 2D).
The NO/GAPDH/Siah1 system is potently inhibited by the drug
CGP2466B, which, at very low nanomolar concentrations, prevents
GAPDH nitrosylation (28). The cocaine-elicited augmentation of
LC3-II is prevented by treatment with 2 nM CGP3466B (Fig. 2 E
and F). Thus, GAPDH nitrosylation appears to be required for
these actions of cocaine.
The nitrosylation of GAPDH that mediates the NO/GAPDH/
Siah1 signaling system selectively involves C150 of GAPDH (25).
We evaluated autophagic influences of cocaine in HEK-293 cells
overexpressing wild-type GAPDH or GAPDH with cysteine-150
mutated to serine (GAPDH-C150S). Generation of LC3-II is
evident after GAPDH over expression and appears to be sig-
nificantly high after cocaine treatment compared with GAPDH-
C150S mutant. The diminished autophagy is evident in the ab-
sence as well as the presence of cocaine (Fig. 2 G, H).
Next, we treated nNOS knockout (KO) mice-derived cortical
cultures (Fig. S2B) to further confirm the role of NO in cocaine-
induced autophagy. Increasing concentrations of cocaine failed
to augment LC3-II levels in nNOS KO neurons (Fig. 2I).
These findings emphasize the importance of GAPDH nitro-
sylation in cocaine-induced autophagy in neurons.
Selectivity of Cocaine’s Influences on Autophagic Neuronal Cell Death.
Thus far, we have established that cocaine impacts autophagy. We
next explored cocaine’s actions upon other modes of programmed
cell death. In neuronal cultures, cocaine half maximally elicits cell
death at about 10 μM (Fig. 3A), which is prevented by CGP3466B
(2 nM). We compared agents that influence different modes
of cell death. The PARP-1–specific inhibitor, 3,4-dihydro-5-
(4-(1-piperidinyl)butoxyl)-1(2H)-isoquinolinone (DPQ), selectively
prevents parthanatos associated with PARP-mediated necrosis (35).
Necrostatin uniquely blocks necroptosis, which is mediated by
RIPK1 (17). N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone
(Z-VAD-fmk) is a well characterized inhibitor of multiple caspases,
a classical mediator of apoptosis (36). Cocaine-elicited cell death in
cortical cultures is not significantly influenced by the inhibitors of
parthanatos, necroptosis, and caspases (Fig. 3B). By contrast, bafi-
lomycin (50 nM) abolishes cocaine-mediated cell death. Thus, co-
caine-associated cell death can be attributed to autophagy rather
than to other well known forms of programmed cell death.
To examine directly a selective role for autophagy in cocaine-
associated cell death, we depleted either ATG 5 or beclin-1
(Fig. S3 A and E), physiologic mediators of autophagy (37).
ATG 5 or beclin-1 depletion markedly diminishes cocaine cyto-
toxicity. By contrast, depletion of caspase-3, PARP-1, or RIPK1
(Fig. 3C and Fig. S3 B–D) has no influence upon the process.
Apoptosis is selectively enhanced by staurosporine, a well known
inhibitor of protein kinases (38). We examined the influence of
staurosporine upon apoptosis monitored by cleavage of caspase-3
(39). Caspase-3 cleavage is elicited by staurosporine, but not by
cocaine, indicating that cocaine does not display proapoptotic
influences (Fig. 3D).
The DNA-alkylating agent MNNG elicits parthanatos-mediated
cell death via PARP-1 cleavage (40). Whereas MNNG substantially
cleaves PARP-1, cocaine fails to do so, indicating that cocaine does
not act via parthanotos (Fig. 3E).
MLKL is phosphorylated by RIPK1 in response to agents that
stimulate necroptosis (41). Necroptosis is typically induced by
treatment with TNF-α in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, an apo-
ptosis inhibitor (36). As reported previously (42), TNF-α, com-
bined with Z-VAD-fmk, increases levels of phospho-MLKL. By
contrast, cocaine has no influence, indicating that cocaine is not
a stimulant of necroptosis (Fig. 3F).
Autophagic cell death is associated with specific morphologic
alterations, such as nuclear concavity and swelling of the peri-
nuclear space (22). Electron microscopic analysis reveals con-
cavity of the nucleus following cocaine treatment (Fig. 3G). By
contrast, we fail to observe nuclear fragmentation or membrane
disruptions that characterize nonautophagic forms of cell death.

 Discussion
Autophagic cell death is a relatively recently appreciated but well
accepted phenomenon defined by specific criteria. Autophagic
death is characterized by autophagic flux and the involvement of
at least two autophagic regulatory factors along with the absence
of apoptosis (43). Cocaine-elicited cell death fulfills these crite-
ria. Thus, cocaine elicits autophagy as evaluated by several in-
dices: induction of LC3-II, degradation of p62, ultrastructural
analysis by TEM, and confocal monitoring of LC3 punctae.
Moreover, we have ruled out involvement of cocaine in other
modes of programmed cell death such as apoptosis, parthanatos,
and necroptosis.
Cocaine induces autophagy in cortical cultures at concentra-
tions as low as 1 μM. These levels are clinically relevant because
recreational abuse of cocaine is associated with peak serum
concentrations between 0.5 and 5 μM. The highest reported
cocaine serum concentration in a living person is 120 μM. Co-
caine concentrations in the brain are generally higher than those
in the blood (44). In human toxicity cases, average brain-to-blood
cocaine concentrations ratio is 9.6-fold (45).
Recently, other workers have described autophagy associated
with cocaine. Guo et al. (46) reported activation of microglia
in response to cocaine, which appeared to involve autophagy
and inflammatory reactions. Cao et al. (37) detected autophagy
in astrocytic cultures following treatment with cocaine. These
studies were restricted to single cell lines and did not discrimi-
nate autophagy from other modes of cytotoxicity. By contrast,
our study systematically rules out a variety of modes of pro-
grammed cell death and establishes that cocaine’s toxic actions
are uniquely associated with autophagy.
Our study also demonstrates that cocaine’s impact upon auto-
phagy involves the NO/GAPDH signaling cascade. Our earlier
investigation (24) established a role for the NO/GAPDH system
in cell death but failed to delineate the type of cell death in-
volved. In this context, the effects of stimulant and neurotoxic
doses of cocaine on NO/GAPDH signaling are blocked by do-
pamine D1 receptor inhibition. In the current work, cocaine
induces NO/GAPDH signaling in primary cortical cultures,
which lack the dopaminergic system. This information suggests
the existence of another mechanism by which cocaine in-
duces autophagy via the NO/GAPDH cascade. Further work is
needed to delineate the upstream molecular events that lead to
NO/GAPDH signaling-mediated activation of autophagy in re-
sponse to high doses of cocaine.
Our findings may have therapeutic relevance. Thus, the notion
that cocaine toxicity is uniquely associated with autophagy im-
plies that selective and potent inhibitors of autophagy may be
therapeutic in treating cocaine users. Such interventions in the
autophagic process may also benefit infants born of cocaine-
using mothers.
In terms of specific agents that might be beneficial, our ob-
servations that the NO/GAPDH pathway mediates cocaine ac-
tions may have therapeutic ramifications. CGP3466B prevents
GAPDH nitrosylation at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM (28)
and has been administered in clinical trials of patients with
Parkinson’s disease as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (47,
48). In these studies CGP3466B appeared to be safe with neg-
ligible side effects. This drug or related agents may be beneficial
in the therapy of cocaine abuse.

Caspase-3, PARP-1, RIPK1, Beclin-1, and ATG-5 shRNA (verified) lentiviral
plasmid, cocaine hydrochloride and poly-l-ornithine hydrobromide were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant murine TNF-α was purchased
from Peprotech. N-methyl-N-nitroso-N′-nitroguanidine (MNNG) was pur-
chased from Chem Service.
Antibodies. Anti–GAPDH-HRP was purchased from GenScript USA. Anti–MLKL,
anti–phospho-MLKL, anti–caspase-3, anti-PARP-1, anti-nNOS, and anti-LC3 were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-NeuN was purchased from
EMD Millipore.
Transfections. HEK-293 cells transfections were performed using the polyfect
transfection reagent following the manufacturer’s instructions (Qiagen).
Lentivirus Production. Second-generation lentiviral vector packaging was used
for lentivirus production. Lentiviral plasmids expressing caspase-3, PARP-1,
RIPK-1, beclin-1, or ATG-5 shRNA were cotransfected into HEK-293T cells
with packaging system psPAX2 and pMD2 plasmids. The media was changed
after overnight incubation. The lentivirus-containing supernatant was collected
after 48 h. Floating cells and cell debris were pelleted by centrifugation of the
supernatant at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Lentivirus particles were pelleted
by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. The lentiviral pellet was
resuspended in 1/200th volume of OPTI-MEM and stored in −80 °C until use.
Primary Neuron Cultures. Animals were housed and cared for in accordance
with the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
(49). Animal experiments were approved by the Johns Hopkins University
Animal Care and Use Committee (JHU ACUC). Mouse primary cortical cul-
tures were prepared from gestational day 16–18 fetal CD-1 mice. Briefly, the
timed pregnant mice were killed by decapitation, the uterus was quickly
dissected out, and pups were decapitated. After removing meninges, the
cerebral cortices were dissected and incubated in 0.025% trypsin–EDTA so-
lution for 15 min. The cells were triturated in plating media containing
Neurobasal-A media without glucose and sodium pyruvate supplemented
with 12.5 mM glucose, 2 mM L-glutamine, and 2% (vol/vol) B-27 minus anti-
oxidants. The cortical cultures were plated on poly-L-ornithine coated plates.
Cortical Culture Treatment. Primary cortical cultures were used between day
in vitro (DIV) 10 and DIV 15. Half of the media was removed from the cells,
mixed with 2× the indicated concentrations of reagents, whereupon the media
was returned to the cells. Cultures were incubated in cocaine-containing me-
dia for 3 or 48 h, respectively, in autophagy and cell death experiments.
Cell Death Assay. Live cultures were stained 48 h after cocaine treatment with
1 μg/mL Hoechst 33342, which stains all cell nuclei, and 7 μM propidium
iodide, which stains dead cell nuclei. Images were immediately collected
using Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. Quantification of cell death in
neurons was performed using NIH image-J software. Neuronal nuclei are
smaller in size and fluoresce at a significantly higher intensity than glial
nuclei. Using these criteria, only neuronal nuclei were counted.
Biotin Switch Assay. Primary cortical cultures were lysed on ice in lysis buffer
containing 100 mM Hepes, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM neocuproine, pH 8.0, 1% SDS,
1% Nonidet P-40, and 100 mM sodium chloride. DNA was degraded by
passing lysate through a 27 gauge needle several times on ice. For each
reaction 1 mg of total protein was used. Free thiols in denatured lysates were
blocked with methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS) at 50 °C for 20 min.
MMTS was removed by acetone precipitation. Nitrosylated thiols were re-
duced using sodium ascorbate and then biotinylated. Streptavidin beads
were used to pull down proteins bearing biotinylated thiols for further
evaluation by Western blot analysis.
Confocal Imaging of Neuronal Nuclei and LC3 Punctae in Neurons. Cortical
neurons were transduced with LC3-RFP using LentiBrite RFP-LC3 Lentiviral
Biosensor (Millipore) to image LC3 puncta. For immunostaining, cells were
fixed with 4% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton
X-100, and blocked with 5% (vol/vol) goat serum. Mouse anti-NeuN antibody
was used at a dilution of 1:100 in 0.025% goat serum in PBS overnight at 4 °C.
For GAPDH immunostaining, GAPDH antibody was used at a dilution of
1:500. GAPDH immunostaining, LC3 puncta, and neuronal nuclei were im-
aged under Zeiss Axiovert 200 with 510-Meta confocal module. Images were
collected using a 40× (oil) 1.3 NA Zeiss Plan-Neofluar objective. Number of
LC3 puncta per cell were counted using Imaris software version 7.7.2.
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). Primary cortical neurons were treated
with indicated concentrations of cocaine. The cells were fixed in 2.5% (vol/vol)

 glutaraldehyde, 3 mM MgCl2, in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for
1 h at room temperature. After buffer rinse, samples were postfixed in 1%
osmium tetroxide in buffer (1 h) on ice in the dark. The cells were stained
with 2% (wt/vol) aqueous uranyl acetate (0.22 μm filtered, 1 h in the dark),
dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol solutions, and embedded
in Eponate 12 (Ted Pella) resin. Samples were polymerized at 37 °C for
2–3 d before moving to 60 °C overnight.
Brain Tissue Preparation for TEM. Mice were perfused with 2% (wt/vol) para-
formaldehyde (freshly prepared from EM grade prill form), 2% (vol/vol) glu-
taraldehyde, 3 mM MgCl2, in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, for 30 min
at a rate of 2 mL/min, then postfixed overnight. Regions of interest were dis-
sected and samples were washed in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer with 3 mM
MgCl2 and 3% (wt/vol) sucrose. Samples were postfixed in reduced 2% (wt/vol)
osmium tetroxide, 1.6% (wt/vol) potassium ferrocyanide in buffer (2 h) on ice
in the dark. Samples were stained with 2% (wt/vol) aqueous uranyl acetate
(0.22 μm filtered, 1 h in the dark), dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol
propylene oxide solutions, and embedded in Eponate 12 (Ted Pella) resin. Samples
were polymerized at 60 °C overnight. Thin sections (60–90 nm) were cut with a
diamond knife on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome and picked up with
2 × 1 mm copper slot grids. Grids were stained with 2% (wt/vol) uranyl acetate in
50% (vol/vol) methanol and lead citrate at 4 °C and observed with a Hitachi
7600 TEM. Images were captured with an AMT CCD XR50 (2K × 2K) camera.
Western Blot Analysis. Cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (150 mM
NaCl, 0.5% CHAPS, 0.1% Triton, 0.1% BSA, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors,
phosphatase inhibitors). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min,
and the protein concentration of the supernatant was measured (Bio-Rad
Protein Assay Dye Reagent Concentrate). Proteins were resolved by SDS-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membranes. The
membranes were blocked for 2 h at room temperature in 20 mM Tris·HCl, pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.02% Tween 20 (Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20)
containing 3% (wt/vol) BSA followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C in
1:1,000 dilution of the respective antibodies for LC3, p62, actin, GAPDH,
MLKLp, MLKL, caspase 3, PARP, beclin-1, ATG5, and RIPK in 3% (wt/vol) BSA.
The membrane was washed three times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20,
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody, and the bands visual-
ized by chemiluminescence. The depicted blots are representative replicates
selected from at least three experiments.
Western Blot Image Quantification and Statistical Analysis. Western blot im-
ages were quantified using ImageJ software. Data are presented as means ±
SD. Unless otherwise indicated, statistical analysis was performed using
Graphpad software with an alpha power level of 0.05. Two-tailed t test was
used to perform two group comparisons. One-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to perform multiple comparisons. Data were graphed as
means ± SEM.
