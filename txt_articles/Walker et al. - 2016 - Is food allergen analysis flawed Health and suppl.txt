Is food allergen analysis flawed? Health and supply
chain risks and a proposed framework to address
urgent analytical needs
M. J. Walker,*a D. T. Burns,b C. T. Elliott,b M. H. Gowlandc and E. N. Clare Millsd
Food allergy is an increasing problem for those affected, their families or carers, the food industry and for
regulators. The food supply chain is highly vulnerable to fraud involving food allergens, risking fatalities
and severe reputational damage to the food industry. Many facets are being pursued to ameliorate the
difficulties including better food labelling and the concept of thresholds of elicitation of allergy symptoms
as risk management tools. These efforts depend to a high degree on the ability reliably to detect and
quantify food allergens; yet all current analytical approaches exhibit severe deficiencies that jeopardise
accurate results being produced particularly in terms of the risks of false positive and false negative
reporting. If we fail to realise the promise of current risk assessment and risk management of food aller-
gens through lack of the ability to measure food allergens reproducibly and with traceability to an inter-
national unit of measurement, the analytical community will have failed a significant societal challenge.
Three distinct but interrelated areas of analytical work are urgently needed to address the substantial gaps
identified: (a) a coordinated international programme for the production of properly characterised clini-
cally relevant reference materials and calibrants for food allergen analysis; (b) an international programme
to widen the scope of proteomics and genomics bioinformatics for the genera containing the major aller-
gens to address problems in ELISA, MS and DNA methods; (c) the initiation of a coordinated international
programme leading to reference methods for allergen proteins that provide results traceable to the SI.
This article describes in more detail food allergy, the risks of inapplicable or flawed allergen analyses with
examples and a proposed framework, including clinically relevant incurred allergen concentrations, to
address the currently unmet and urgently required analytical requirements. Support for the above rec-
ommendations from food authorities, business organisations and National Measurement Institutes is
important; however transparent international coordination is essential. Thus our recommendations are
primarily addressed to the European Commission, the Health and Food Safety Directorate, DG Santé. A
global multidisciplinary consortium is required to provide a curated suite of data including genomic and
proteomic data on key allergenic food sources, made publically available on line.
Introduction
Food fraud poses risks to consumer confidence and business
continuity, as the horse meat episode demonstrated,1 and also
to health, for example the well recorded morbidity and
mortality from counterfeit alcoholic drinks.2–4 There are also
risks to people with food allergies as we will describe. Allergen
analysis is a key tool in supply chain scrutiny as well as in the
investigation of adverse reactions. Herein we briefly introduce
food allergy, describe with examples the risks of inapplicable
allergen analyses and propose a framework to address the cur-
rently unmet and urgently required analytical requirements.
Food allergy
Food allergies, i.e. adverse immunologic (IgE and non-IgE
mediated) reactions to food, have resulted in considerable
morbidity5 and reached epidemic proportions in the industri-
alized world6,7 affecting up to 10% of young children and
2–3% of adults. Anaphylaxis, a rapid onset multi-organ system
allergic reaction with release of chemical mediators from mast
cells and basophils, can cause fatalities. The risk of such
deaths, though comparatively rare,8 contributes to well-docu-

 mented detriment to the quality of life for allergic consumers
and their families.9–11 There are burdens on health care,12 on
businesses (food recalls, for example) and regulators13 and in
less developed countries where, owing to poor labelling and
awareness, significant challenges may exist. Current reputed
cures for food allergies remain experimental and lifelong
avoidance of the eliciting food(s) is required. Food intolerance
such as coeliac disease also imposes significant burdens14 and
strict food avoidance is usually necessary.
Legislation, risk and thresholds
Regulatory risk management strategies for allergic consumers
have focused on providing information about the presence of
food allergens through label declarations.15 In December 2014
European labelling law, Regulation 1169/2011, extended such
disclosure requirements, see Table 1, to non-prepacked food
including
that
available
in
catering
establishments.16
Cross-contamination with allergens may trigger the general
principles of European17 and UK food law (Food Safety Act
1990) that make it an offense to sell food that is unsafe for, or
not of the nature, substance, or quality demanded by allergic
consumers, particularly if specifically intended for their con-
sumption. The risks posed by the unintended presence of
allergens in food have resulted in proliferation of precaution-
ary (e.g. “may contain…”) labelling, widely regarded as unsatis-
factory.18,19
Much
effort
is
being
expended
on
the
development of ‘thresholds’,20 ‘action levels’ 21 or ‘reference
doses’, e.g. those advocated by the European Academy of
Allergy and Clinical Immunology, EAACI22 for major allergens.
The lack of agreed limits below which only the most sensitive
allergic subjects might react is viewed by many as preventing
the development of evidence-based allergen management
strategies that are understood by clinicians, patients and
industry. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has com-
prehensively reviewed allergenic foods and food ingredients
for labelling purposes. EFSA however declined to consider
advocating thresholds on the grounds that labelling and the
level of risk that may be acceptable (e.g. the fraction of the
allergic population protected and to what extent) are risk man-
agement decisions outside EFSA’s remit.23 Nevertheless, the
principal legal measure16 governing food labelling in the EU
includes powers (Article 36) for the European Commission to
adopt law on information on the unintentional presence in
food of substances causing allergic or intolerance based reac-
tions. The most probable basis for such law would be allergen
elicitation thresholds which are not possible without allergen
reference materials. Table 2 shows reference doses cited by the
European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,
EAACI, these data (second column) are identical to the data
exhibited in the Allergen Bureau Voluntary Incidental Trace

Supply chain vulnerability – allergens
Two incidents illustrate well the vulnerability of the food supply
chain, and hence of allergic consumers. These examples (a)
illustrate evidence of deliberate substitution of almond by
peanut in the supply chain and (b) describe what was initially
thought to be deliberate adulteration of cumin with almond but

 in fact turned out to be contamination of the cumin supply
chain with mahaleb. Both examples demonstrate that good
allergen analysis is necessary to help protect the supply chain.
Almond or peanut?
Enforcement surveillance24 of allergen compliance in catering
establishments regularly concludes that specifically asking for
an allergen-free meal provides little real protection. Such
appeared to be the case for two chicken tikka masala meals
found to contain peanut in a survey in 2010/11.25 However,
follow up revealed a supplier had introduced groundnuts
(peanuts) instead of almond powder as contracted into the
supply chain. The firm was convicted on prosecution. The con-
viction was, however, overturned on appeal on technical legal
grounds.26 Nevertheless the Food Standards Agency (FSA)
Annual Report of Incidents 2012 refers to investigations of
severe allergic reactions following the consumption of curry
dishes purchased from Indian restaurants and takeaways.
Noting that some of these incidents resulted in fatalities, FSA
reported that some incidents were caused by the use of a
ground almond ingredient, which also contained ground
peanut (groundnut). FSA identified weaknesses in the food
chain where such contamination and loss of clear information
occurred, including poor understanding of the significance of
substituting peanuts for almonds, incorrect allergen infor-
mation provided at a point of sale, and unclear labelling and
confusion between peanuts and tree nuts (almonds) leading to
the potential for accidental substitution. However FSA also
reported possible economically motivated adulteration, driven
by the financial incentive to substitute ground almonds with
ground peanut.27
Almond or mahaleb?
Against this backdrop in October 2014 when Canadian auth-
orities found undeclared peanut and almond protein in pro-
ducts
containing
cumin,
it
was
feared
that
a
further,
potentially life threatening, breach of supply chain security
had occurred.28 Suspicions fell on cross contamination in har-
vesting, transport, storage, or processing, adulteration with
almond shells, or in the case of the peanut protein, adultera-
tion with peanut hulls or peanut meal animal feed. The FSA
issued the first of a small number of related recalls, of ground
cumin sold by the Barts Ingredients Company Ltd found to
contain traces of almond protein not listed on the label, on
31 January 2015.29 FSA referred this as an official technical
appeal30 to the Government Chemist,31 asking for a review of
the analysis that had led to the recall. In early March 2015

 another material, mahaleb, gives a positive reading for almond
using test methods.32 On 30 April 2015 the Canadian auth-
orities rescinded product recalls of cumin and cumin-contain-
ing
products
previously
thought
to
contain
undeclared
almond. The Canadian statement noted that the recalls had
been based on “original laboratory results [that] were false
positives…[caused
by]
cross-reactivity of
mahaleb…(Prunus
mahaleb), with the almond allergen test kit. It is highly likely
that the positive sample results for the ground cumin and
cumin-containing products were due to mahaleb contami-
nation and not almond”.33 Almond is a member of the genus
‘Prunus’ – trees and shrubs, which includes plums, cherries,
peaches, nectarines, apricots and mahaleb. Prunus mahaleb
was previously little known in the UK but was said also to have
been handled in the cumin supply chain. The UK Government
Chemist subsequently determined that although limitations
still remain in the state of the science that prevent the
presence of almond being completely ruled out, the results of
the technical appeal investigation indicate that the queried
sample contained a Prunus protein and DNA the origin of
which was consistent with mahaleb rather than almond.34–36
While P. mahaleb does not appear in the list of allergens
required by law to be declared if used intentionally as an
ingredient in food, it is important for a food business to
understand its supply chain to assess and manage cross
contamination risks. Given the amino acid homology between
almond and mahaleb a risk to Prunus-allergic individuals
might remain.

 Allergen analysis
Analysis for food allergens is required for many reasons. Key
industry standards37 emphasise greater transparency, trace-
ability and integrity in the supply chain requiring analysis to
check that food is what it is claimed to be, and encourage
systems to reduce exposure to fraud. Analysis supports vali-
dation and verification of factory cleaning and investigation of
recalls and incidents.38 Surveillance and enforcement, particu-
larly after the introduction of more extensive labelling require-
ments,16 rely heavily on analysis to support and protect
consumers and responsible businesses and, in the event of
adulteration, provide evidence for criminal or civil action in
the courts; a key deterrent.26 Investigation of adverse reactions
may require analysis to find out what caused the reaction, and
therefore enable the individual to avoid it in the future. Investi-
gation of fatalities, already problematic,26 requires analysis e.g.
of food seized at the incident, stomach contents or other for-
ensic exhibits.
The rescindment, (see above) because of initially flawed
analysis, of over two dozen allergen recalls on both sides of
the Atlantic risks uncertainty and confusion over allergen
testing in the future. This jeopardises consumer safety now
and the development of allergen thresholds in the future.39
The origins and resolution of these problems lie in the difficul-
ties of allergen analysis.
Food allergens that bind to IgE are large protein molecules
and many approaches have been taken to their analysis.40
Most routine food allergen analysis is undertaken by Enzyme
Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) enabling detection and
(semi-)
quantification.
Polymerase
Chain
Reaction
(PCR)
assays are also applied in allergen risk assessment and man-
agement. For both techniques detection is less of an issue,
although not without problems41 but sound quantification
remains elusive.42 Commercially available ELISA kits exhibit
variable and manufacturer specific sensitivities and cross-reac-
tivity.43 In proficiency testing multimodal datasets for allergen
ELISAs are common and different assigned values have to be
generated for the different kits used.44 Recent work on
precautionary labelling on pre-packed processed food and
concentrations of certain cross contaminant allergens in foods
suffered from unexpected cross reactivity in the commercial
ELISA. False positive results were identified arising from an
Association
of
Analytical
Communities
(AOAC)
approved
peanut assay owing to cross reactivity to soya. The cross
reactivity which was evidently not a feature of the original
assay seemed to have developed after many years use of the kit
and necessitated a troublesome late stage review of the
research findings.45 Structural changes in the target molecules
by food processing or sample extraction may prevent detection.
PCR assays are probative of the source species DNA (which
may not be present e.g. egg white) rather than the allergen
protein. Moreover proteins are the hazard and thus the key
measurand. PCR is essentially qualitative at present. Quantifi-
cation based on copy number can be derived from cycle
thresholds but requires reference materials to construct a cali-
bration curve, although digital PCR may circumvent this
difficulty. Even so is not easy to convert a quantification based
on copy number to a weight/weight basis. There has been little
systematic research46 on the relationships between the find-
ings of PCR approaches and protein techniques such as ELISA
or liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry,
LC-MS/MS, for allergen analysis to assess their comparability.
Hence, there is a requirement for orthogonal methods that
confirm molecular identity and that are capable of valid quanti-
fication. LC-MS/MS methods, e.g. multiple reaction monitoring
of peptides arising from enzymatic digestion of proteins, offer
such advantages, along with the possibility of multiplexed high
throughput.47,48 The application of LC-MS/MS is still recent in
food allergen analysis. It is possible to detect proteins and pep-
tides with a high degree of sensitivity and resolving power, pro-
viding
protein
composition,
structure
and
sequence
information, and MS has the potential for a wide linear
dynamic range, and absolute identification and quantification
of allergens. However the techniques require a high level of
expertise and costly equipment; extraction and cleanup steps
are necessary and the methods can be laborious and time con-
suming. The complexity of most food matrixes represents a sig-
nificant challenge even to MS although guidance is available,49
including on a model system that demonstrates isotope dilution
mass spectrometric traceability from a set of peptides to an
allergenic protein.50 Because ELISA is much more widely used
for allergen analysis than MS or PCR there is more published
evidence of its deficiencies but similar deficiencies apply to
both MS and PCR approaches. Thus the promise of MS or PCR
will be lost if underpinning work suggested herein is not
carried out.
In summary, current allergen analysis would be impossible
without ELISA which has brought many benefits in allergen risk
assessment and risk management. However all current forms of
allergen analysis present some deficiencies which may jeopar-
dise present and future risk assessment and risk management
of food allergy, a problem of high and increasing importance.
The attitude of the analytical
community
In order to assess the attitude of the analytical community in
the UK to food allergen analysis a small anonymous survey of
prominent food analytical service providers, including Public
Analysts
was
carried
out
(8/07/2015–14/07/2015).
The
responses (n = 36) showed that food allergen analysis is very
(88.9%) or somewhat (11.1%) important to laboratories, and is
increasing (63.9%) or increasing a lot (11.1%). Carrying out
such analyses was deemed to be difficult (41.7%) or extremely
difficult (2.8%) and 48.6% found reference materials (RMs) to
be available but with reservations as to their usefulness or
credibility, available but of limited relevance (22.9%) or not
available (17.1%). Confirmation of food allergen detection and
quantification by an orthogonal technique was scored as very
difficult (45.7%) or slightly difficult (25.7%).

 A framework to address the problems
The importance of allergen analysis, its relative difficulty and
lack of relevant and trusted reference materials revealed in the
above survey correspond with the experiences of the authors.
Three distinct but interrelated areas of analytical work are
urgently needed to address the substantial gaps identified;
production of reference materials, a bioinformatics gap analy-
sis and development of reference methods resulting in metro-
logically traceable results.
Reference materials
Sykes et al.44 showed that inclusion of a ‘reference spiked
sample’ in a Proficiency Test, PT, round where the raw data
were non-normal and multi-modal, tended to yield ratio data
that
were
normal
and
symmetrically
distributed.
These
authors, and (non-exhaustively) many others51–54 call for the
development of internationally recognised sets of allergen
reference materials to improve the reliability of allergen analy-
sis. Reference material (RM) and Certified Reference Material
(CRM) are well defined terms55–57 within an associated inter-
national infrastructure.58 It is not always clear that the limited
number of food allergen RMs currently commercially available
comply with this infrastructure. Reference materials produced
by National Measurement Institutes exhibit the highest stan-
dards. Taylor et al.59 described with examples the preparation
of naturally incurred standards as allergenic food residues
incorporated into various representative food matrices and
then processed in a manner similar to “real-world” food
processing.
Making a reference material is relatively expensive owing to
the complexity of production. The following steps should be
carried out within a documented quality system:
• Effective project planning and project management
• Definition of need, background and clear specification
• Material procurement
• Identification or development of a validated analytical method
for the measurand so as to distinguish measurement dis-
persion from dispersion arising from homogeneity and
stability issues
• Preparation of the material by well characterised methods
• Packaging to ensure integrity and stability
• Storage under controlled conditions to maintain stability
• Homogeneity and stability evaluation by validated methods
with known performance data
• Characterisation and certification (if that proves possible)
with documented traceability of values, an uncertainty
budget and consideration of the commutability of the
material
• Preparation of a certificate to accompany the material,
and a production report
• Distribution and sales, ensuring integrity of the material
• On-going monitoring and customer support.
Thus producers of allergen RMs should address the above
points and attempt to ensure the matrix is industrially realistic
for processed food. The incurred concentrations should be
appropriate for and preferably establish a relationship with the
concentrations that affect allergy sufferers. A prototype such
material set, (a blank material and a QC material with peanut
protein added at 10 mg kg−1) has been prepared based on a
EuroPrevall study matrix (chocolate dessert mix)60 used to
assess clinical thresholds.61,62
Both calibrant and matrix reference materials for food aller-
gens are required. However their production is not trivial. The
legislation defines allergens in terms of the food (Table 1) but
analysis targets proteins or their peptides (or DNA). For the
protein allergens the analyte is often neither exactly defined
nor easy to render identical in sample and calibrator. Typically,
multiple allergen proteins and isoforms are present, in a
complex matrix. Taking peanut as an example, the food itself
includes proteins, lipids, carbohydrates and minerals63 avail-
able in multiple processed formats including raw, roasted and/
or defatted to varying degrees and included in a wide
range of other foods.64 The peanut allergens include at least
12–14 multiple specific proteins, of which only Ara h 1, Ara h
2, Ara h 3, and Ara h 6 have been demonstrated to be clinically
important.65,66 Protein post-translational modifications, PTM,
occur and further complexity is introduced by biological vari-
ation, fractionation (intended and adventitious) and reaction
with other food components. The analyte (measurand) there-
fore may be, in MS, peptides expected to be uniquely represen-
tative of specific proteins, for ELISA, known proteins that may
or may not be the allergens or, for PCR, a DNA sequence. Prag-
matism is required52 as ideal solutions to the above problems
will not easily, economically or soon be found. Therefore a
staged approach is needed starting with non-ideal reference
materials, as explained below. Maximum transparency is
required as to the commercial origin and compositional
characteristics of the allergenic food used to formulate,
initially, simple matrix reference materials gravimetrically pre-
pared at blank (zero) and clinically relevant allergen concen-
trations. Such concentrations
are suggested in Table 2.
Homogeneity and stability studies and further characterisation
by, at least, ELISA should be performed. Experience gained
will enable progression to incurred allergens in processed
foods representing a suitable spectrum of protein, lipid and
carbohydrate compositions,67 followed by production of certi-
fied reference materials representing those RMs found most
useful. It should be noted that production of reference
materials is rarely a commercial proposition.
Much can be learned from work that led to what remains
the ‘gold standard’ reference material for gliadin, described in
the proceedings of the Working Group on Prolamin Analysis
and Toxicity (WGPAT).68 Securing food that is free from gluten
(gliadin) for those with coeliac disease is as important as an
allergen-free diet and fraught with the same analytical difficul-
ties. Moreover the definition of gluten is empirical: “gluten” is
defined as a protein fraction from wheat, rye, barley, oats or
their crossbred varieties and derivatives, to which some
persons are intolerant and that is insoluble in water and 0.5 M
NaCl. The prolamin content of gluten is generally taken as
50% and prolamins are defined as the fraction from gluten

 that can be extracted by 40–70% ethanol.69 This definition
enabled WGPAT to prepare a gliadin reference material by
extraction from milled wheat kernels representing a specific
year’s harvest of the most commonly grown cultivars in 3 Euro-
pean countries. Moreover the obtained gliadin (PWG-gliadin)
was characterised by a wide spectrum of techniques including
immunological, MS and electrophoretic as well as for stability
and homogeneity, as summarised by van Eckert et al.70 In
2005 the Institute for Reference Material and Measurements of
the European Commission (IRMM) declined to accept PWG-
gliadin as a certified reference material and returned it to
WGPAT in 2006 from where it can be obtained.68 Although it is
difficult to speculate on the reasons for IRMM’s action, the
want of a route to full metrological traceability for PWG-
gliadin, (and allergens in general), that the proposals in this
paper seek to address, may be one of the root causes.
It is recommended that a coordinated international pro-
gramme be set up for the production of properly characterised
reference materials and calibrants for allergen analysis, begin-
ning with the rapid availability of simple materials (e.g. contain-
ing, separately, the major allergens (e.g. as defatted and/or
freeze dried powdered substances) (Table 1) at zero (blank) and
clinically relevant concentrations (Table 2).The programme
should progress to incurred allergens in processed foods rep-
resenting a suitable spectrum of protein, lipid and carbohydrate
compositions,67 followed by production of certified reference
materials representing those RMs found most useful.
Bioinformatics gap analysis
Prior to the Government Chemist’s investigation that led to
the recent rescindment of the UK recall of cumin, cross reactiv-
ity of some commercial almond ELISAs to apricot kernel was
well known and acknowledged.71 That such cross reactivity was
widespread across the genus Prunus only became apparent
during our investigation, and resulted from the homologies
across that genus. DNA databases of NCBI72 GenBank,73 and
BOLD74 were accessed for publically available DNA and amino
acid sequence data on the genus Prunus. Searches (24/03/15)
revealed 904 individual records of Prunus on the BOLD data-
base, representing 188 different species originating from 19
different countries. A search of the GenBank database revealed
236 565 nucleotide sequences for Prunus, of which 99 491 are
derived from P. armeniaca, 1747 from P. dulcis but only 49
from P. mahaleb.36 It was also required to supplement infor-
mation from e.g. UniProt75 which provides freely accessible
protein sequence and functional information that is as com-
prehensive as currently possible, with experimental data on
suitable peptides by LC-Time-of-Flight MS. Hence there is a
gap in the bioinformatics databases that places difficulties in
the way of designing PCR DNA and MS assays with the
required specificity to manage the supply chain for allergens.
To our knowledge no systematic assessment is available of
such bioinformatic gaps and homology across the species for
the priority major allergens.
It is recommended that an international programme be set up
to widen the scope of nucleotide and amino acid sequence data-
bases and proteomics and genomics bioinformatics generally for
the genera containing the major allergens (Table 1) to pinpoint
possible future problems in ELISA, MS and DNA methods.
Further coordinated international programmes to mitigate any
cross reactivity and fill database gaps are also recommended.
This task can be made easier by emerging genomic and pro-
teomic tools that foster better understanding of molecular and
phylogenetic relationships and conservation of sequences. It is
possible to impute missing data on nucleotide base sequences
and protein amino acid sequences in an efficient and effective
manner. Moreover, allergen bioinformatics would benefit from
more efficient search tools such as text mining and ‘Intelligent
Systems for Molecular Biology’76 Learned journals also have a
part to play by requiring uploading to databases mentioned
above and, for example PRIDE,77 of relevant information (e.g.
mass spectrometry proteomics data) as a condition of publi-
cation of a submitted manuscript.
Metrologically traceable methods
Metrological traceability is the property of an analytical result
that allows measurements made in different laboratories
under different conditions to be compared in a meaningful
way, within an international infrastructure, the International
System of Units (the SI). Such work is carried out by National
Measurement
Institutes
(NMIs),
in
each
developed
country.78–80 Metrological traceability of allergen protein data
is currently possible only by MS-based absolute quantification
such as isotope dilution MS, IDMS, a primary ratio method that
relates results directly to the SI with a small measurement
uncertainty, and which is commonly used for the characteris-
ation of small molecule CRMs.81 The principles of exact match-
ing (EM)-IDMS have been applied to absolute quantification of
proteins based on proteolytic (most commonly tryptic) digestion
of the protein, the use of isotopically labelled peptides as
internal standards and of synthetic unlabelled peptides as
primary standards. Isotopically labelled and unlabelled peptides
are more readily available, and less expensive than isotopically
labelled proteins, and are better characterised. Application to
allergen proteins is difficult and costly,50 but once achieved can
be cascaded via reference materials and certified reference
materials so that the outcomes should be available at modest
cost to support routine analysis.
It is recommended that an international programme be
initiated leading to reference measurement methods for aller-
gen proteins which provide results traceable to the SI. The
methods should be applicable to the major allergens (Table 1),
at clinically relevant concentrations (Table 2) in processed
foods covering an appropriate range of protein, lipid and
carbohydrate composition.
International collaboration
National support from food authorities, business organis-
ations and National Measurement Institutes for the above
recommendations is important, however international coordi-

 nation is essential. The European Union legislates for the
largest number of priority food allergen groups (Table 1).15
Within the European Commission, the Health and Food Safety
Directorate, DG Santé, is responsible for protection and
improvement of public health, ensuring Europe’s food is safe
and wholesome and that citizens can be confident that their
interests are protected. Work is already underway by several
bodies, including individual National Measurement Institutes,
(including LGC, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the Euro-
pean Commission and NIST), the MoniQA Association82,83 and
iFAAM, a European Union Seventh Framework Programme
‘Integrated approaches to food allergen and allergy manage-
ment’.84 Collating the various global work streams is needed
to focus on the interrelated areas of analytical work that we
have identified. This must be done in a transparent manner to
achieve the aspirations of all stakeholders. DG Santé fulfils the
criteria suggested by the above analysis. Thus our recommen-
dations are primarily addressed to DG Santé which should
work closely with relevant bodies outside Europe to avoid
duplication of effort or gaps.
Conclusions
Food allergy is an increasing problem for all stakeholders and
the food supply chain has been shown to be vulnerable to
fraud involving food allergens, risking fatalities and reputa-
tional damage to the food industry. Legislation, risk assess-
ment and risk management of food allergens show a high
dependency on the ability to detect food allergens and quanti-
tatively determine them. All current analytical approaches
exhibit described deficiencies that jeopardise accurate results
and risk false positives and false negatives. If we fail to realise
the promise of many strands of risk assessment and risk man-
agement of food allergens through lack of the ability to
measure food allergens reproducibly and with traceability, the
analytical community will have failed a significant societal
challenge. We recommend three distinct but interrelated areas
of work urgently needed to address the substantial gaps identi-
fied: reference material production and reference method
development along with better bioinformatics. There are mul-
tiple strands of risk assessment and risk management cur-
rently underway however the participant organisations should
increase their mutual interaction. Moreover the scale of the
problems identified and their technical solution are such that
only a planned international programme, coordinated we
suggest by DG Santé will be capable of addressing the issues
quickly and efficiently to provide integrated solutions. A global
multidisciplinary consortium is required to provide a curated
suite of data including genomic and proteomic data on key
allergenic food sources, made publically available on line. As a
first step we suggest a pump priming workshop within the
next year to support the development of such a consortium
bringing together the analytical, food science and clinical com-
munities along with patient support groups, representatives of
food manufacturers, and the regulatory agencies. Such an
international programme should be aligned with the timescale
envisaged for the implementation of Article 36 of Regulation
1169/2011 that gives the Commission powers to address aller-
gen cross contamination. We suggest EFSA, following its
opinion on allergens,23 should continue to be involved; the
programme should be of at least 5 years duration and

 must have regard to the work of the organisations and
research programmes mentioned in this paper but also e.g. the
Allergen Bureau,21 and EAACI22 in the development of refer-
ence doses.
It is clear that there are significant problems to be solved,
for example do we know if proteins purchased as a starting
step in an analytical investigation really mimic the allergenic
proteins e.g. as regards post translational modification, PTM,
and tertiary structure? However, with work on these and all the
strands outlined herein progress can be made. Calibrants are
needed such as gravimetrically prepared peptide solutions
with known concentrations traceable to the SI, or a solution of
a well characterised protein of known concentration traceable
by way of peptides to the SI.49,50 But how will these relate to a
matrix reference material, say a food such as light roasted
defatted peanut incurred in an industrially relevant matrix at a
clinically relevant concentration? Fig. 1 illustrates in a highly
simplified manner how this might be accomplished. For some
food allergens clinical and bioinformatics studies have already
identified relevant markers or allergenic proteins for which
signature peptides are available. But this remains to be accom-
plished for all the major allergens. With the identification of
the major relevant proteins of an allergenic food, and charac-
terisation of the impact of food processing, analytical extrac-
tion, PTM, and tertiary structure (none of these are trivial
tasks) a reference material can be created by either of two
related approaches:
(a) A ‘chimera’ theoretical matrix RM containing, in an
industrially relevant matrix, clinically relevant concentrations
of the optimal number of the separate component allergenic
proteins of the food allergen already individually characterised
and traceable to the SI by isotope dilution MS of the signature
peptides, Cryar et al.50 following the recommendations of
Johnson et al.49 or
(b) An empirical matrix RM containing, in an industrially
relevant matrix, clinically relevant concentrations of mixed
proteins extracted and characterised as described by van
Eckert et al.70 and further traceable to the SI by investigations
described in (a).
Fig. 1 also indicates by way of a ‘traffic light’ code current
progress towards the above goals; ‘green’ (i.e. accomplished),
‘amber (i.e. under way) or ‘red’ (i.e. yet to be done).
The recommendations herein are of a complexity and
resource demand that only an internationally coordinated
effort can accomplish them. However, rarely has such an excit-
ing interdisciplinary scientific endeavour arisen as a solution
to a key socially relevant problem.
