The known Pain is the most common reason for emergency
department presentations, but is often inadequately managed.
Acupuncture is widely used in community settings, but only
rarely in emergency departments.
The new Acupuncture was equivalent and non-inferior to
pharmacotherapy in providing analgesia for patients with back
pain and ankle sprain. There was no difference between groups
in adverse events, acceptability or health resource use, but pain
was not managed optimally by either acupuncture or
pharmacotherapy, nor by their combination.
The implications Acupuncture is safe, acceptable and has an
analgesic effect comparable with that of pharmacotherapy,
but none of the therapeutic strategies used provided optimal
analgesia within one hour of presentation.
P
ain is the most common reason for emergency department
(ED) presentations and is often inadequately managed.1-3
EDs are complex environments in which patients seek
relief from undiagnosed pain, and clinicians must make timely
decisions on the basis of limited information. This situation poses
treatment challenges, and raises ethical and logistic problems for
designing clinical trials that meet the pragmatic needs of patients
and ED staff while also maintaining scientific rigour.4
Acupuncture is widely used by medical practitioners and other
clinicians
to relieve pain in community practice settings.5
Acupuncture can provide analgesia for chronic musculoskeletal
pain and headache,6-9 and its use is covered by therapeutic guide-
lines for acute pain.10,11 However, there have been few clinical trials
of acupuncture for treating acute pain, and few EDs offer it for pain
relief.12-14 Two randomised controlled trials of acupuncture in ED
settings have been published: one reported greater pain reduction
with acupuncture together with standard therapy than with stan-
dard therapy alone,15 while the other reported significant neuro-
logical and functional recovery in patients with acute spinal cord
injuries.16 A further study found that it reduced dental pain in
patients waiting for emergency dental care.17 These studies, how-
ever, are insufficient for recommending that acupuncture be
adopted in the ED, and they did not provide information on the
length of stay or the applicability and acceptability of acupuncture.
Our study aimed to determine whether acupuncture is effective,
safe, acceptable and feasible for patients presenting to the ED with
low back pain, migraine or acute ankle injuries. The primary aim
was to determine whether acupuncture alone or as an adjunct to
pharmacotherapy is at least as effective as pharmacotherapy in
providing clinically significant pain relief within an hour of
presentation. The secondary aim was to determine whether
acupuncture alone or as an adjunct improves functionality, is safe
and acceptable to patients, and reduces health resource use.

Abstract
Objectives: This study aimed to assess analgesia provided by
acupuncture, alone or in combination with pharmacotherapy, to
patients presenting to emergency departments with acute low
back pain, migraine or ankle sprain.
Design: A pragmatic, multicentre, randomised, assessor-
blinded, equivalence and non-inferiority trial of analgesia,
comparing acupuncture alone, acupuncture plus
pharmacotherapy, and pharmacotherapy alone for alleviating
pain in the emergency department.
Setting, participants: Patients presenting to emergency
departments in one of four tertiary hospitals in Melbourne with
acute low back pain, migraine, or ankle sprain, and with a pain
score on a 10-point verbal numerical rating scale (VNRS) of
at least 4.
Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was
pain at one hour (T1). Clinically relevant pain relief was defined
as achieving a VNRS score below 4, and statistically relevant
pain relief as a reduction in VNRS score of greater than 2 units.
Results: 1964 patients were assessed between January 2010
and December 2011; 528 patients with acute low back pain (270
patients), migraine (92) or ankle sprain (166) were randomised
to acupuncture alone (177 patients), acupuncture plus
pharmacotherapy (178) or pharmacotherapy alone (173).
Equivalence and non-inferiority of treatment groups was found
overall and for the low back pain and ankle sprain groups in both
intention-to-treat and per protocol (PP) analyses, except in the
PP equivalence testing of the ankle sprain group. 15.6% of
patients had clinically relevant pain relief and 36.9% had
statistically relevant pain relief at T1; there were no between-
group differences.
Conclusion: The effectiveness of acupuncture in providing acute
analgesia for patients with back pain and ankle sprain was
comparable with that of pharmacotherapy. Acupuncture is a
safe and acceptable form of analgesia, but none of the
examined therapies provided optimal acute analgesia. More
effective options are needed.

 pharmacotherapy, and combined acupuncture and pharmaco-
therapy for treating patients presenting to EDs with ankle sprain,
migraine or lower back pain. It was undertaken in four large
tertiary hospitals in Melbourne — two public EDs (the Northern
Hospital and the Alfred Hospital Emergency and Trauma Centre)
and two private EDs (the Epworth and Cabrini Hospitals) —
between January 2010 and December 2011. The full protocol of the
trial has been reported previously.18
Selection of participants
Patients were included if they presented to the ED when an
acupuncturist was present, and were at least 18 years old, required
analgesia for acute low back pain, migraine or acute ankle injuries,
and had a pain score of at least 4 on a 10-point verbal numerical
rating scale (VNRS).19 Patients were excluded if the treating
physician felt inclusion was inappropriate because of the signs of
illness, or if the patient:
�
had a temperature above 37.7�C;
�
had experienced major trauma;
�
used anticoagulation medication or had a mechanical heart
valve;
�
had skin infections precluding the use of certain acupuncture
points;
�
refused or was unable to provide consent;
�
had used any form of analgesia in the 60 minutes before
presenting to the ED; or
�
had presented to an ED for the same condition more than four
times in the previous 3 months.
Randomisation and masking
Block randomisation employed a computerised randomisation
sequence that stratified for each condition and site. Participants
were not blinded to their treatment allocation. Single blinding was
maintained by blinding assessors to treatment allocation, and
acupuncturists to pharmacotherapy use.
Interventions
Acupuncture alone. Acupuncture was provided by either a
registered Chinese medicine practitioner or an ED physician with
medical acupuncture qualifications. Treatment protocols (online
Appendix), determined by a panel of specialist acupuncturists,
provided predetermined points for each condition, as well as
additional points for individualising treatment.18
Pharmacotherapy alone. Pharmacotherapy was administered
according to a standardised protocol based on the relevant national
guidelines of the National Institute of Clinical Studies and
the National Health and Medical Research Council.11,20,21 This
protocol included first and second line drugs, as well as rescue
medication
administered
at
the
discretion
of
the
treating
physicians, regardless of group allocation (Box 1).
Combined
treatment. Combined
therapy
included
both
acupuncture
and
pharmacotherapy,
with
acupuncture
administered 15 minutes before or after pharmacotherapy to
maintain blinding of the acupuncturist.
Specific treatments. All ankle injury patients received rest, ice,
compression and elevation regardless of their treatment allocation;
migraine patients receivedintravenous fluidsat the discretion ofthe
treating physician. Rescue therapy, including parenteral opiates,
was provided to patients with inadequate pain relief after one hour
(T1), or earlier if the treating physician deemed it necessary.
Measurements
Pain was assessed at the delivery of the intervention (T0)
by hospital nursing or allied health staff blind to treatment
allocation, and then hourly (T1, T2 etc.) until discharge. It was
assessed 36e60 hours after discharge by a blinded researcher
from a different site via telephone. Data were recorded on a
handwritten case record form, and entered (double data entry)
into a secure online database.
The primary outcome measures were pain at T1 as measured on the
VNRS (0 ¼ no pain; 10 ¼ worst pain imaginable) and recorded by
blinded assessors.19 Clinically relevant pain relief was defined as
achieving a VNRS score below 4, and statistically relevant pain
relief as a reduction in VNRS score of greater than 2 units.
Cross-sectional,
between-group
comparisons
were
deemed
significant if there was a difference of at least 1.5 VNRS units.
Secondary outcome measures included:
�
functionality for each condition at T48 as measured by the
Oswestry Low Back Disability Questionnaire,22 the 24-hour
Migraine Quality of Life questionnaire,23 or the Patient’s
Global Assessment of Ankle Injury Scale;24
�

and at T48, based on ratings of satisfaction and willingness to
repeat similar management in future;

 Statistical analysis
Power and sample size. The sample size calculation was based on
testing of equivalence between the acupuncture only and
pharmacotherapy only groups, and the testing of non-inferiority of
acupuncture plus pharmacotherapy to pharmacotherapy only,
overall and for each condition individually. A sample size of
505 participants was calculated to achieve 80% power (a ¼ 0.05)
after adjusting for an attrition rate of no more than 10%.
Analysis. The data were analysed by an independent, blinded
statistician. Descriptive statistics for categorical variables are
reported as numbers and percentages; continuous variables are
reported as means with standards deviations (SDs) or medians
with interquartile ranges (IQRs), and were compared in Pear-
son c2 or KruskaleWallis equality of populations rank tests as
appropriate. In intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the primary
outcome measure (pain score at T1) was considered to be
equivalent for the acupuncture only and pharmacotherapy only
groups if the upper and lower confidence intervals of the
between-group difference was less than 1.5 VNRS units. Non-
inferiority between groups was also tested, and defined as
the appropriate one-sided confidence interval of the group
difference being no greater than 1.5 VNRS units at T1. Based on
a ¼ 0.05 for a two-sided equivalence test and 0.025 for a one-
sided non-inferiority test, and adjusted for undertaking six
tests, 99.2% and 99.6% confidence intervals for equivalence and
non-inferiority testing respectively were calculated. The ana-
lyses were repeated as per protocol (PP) analyses when any
patient in the acupuncture only group also received rescue
pharmacotherapy, and was therefore considered to be in the
acupuncture plus pharmacotherapy group. All analyses were
conducted in Stata 13.1 (StataCorp).
Ethics approval
Ethics approval was provided by the Human Research Ethics
Committees of RMIT University (reference, 12/09), the Northern
Hospital (reference, CC16/09), the Alfred Hospital (reference, 21/
10), the Cabrini Institute (reference, 01-11-04-11) and the Epworth
Hospital (reference, 44409).
Results
A total of 1964 patients were assessed between January
2010 and December 2011, of whom 528 were recruited
(mean age, 41.0 years; SD, 15.1 years); 47.4% were
women. The proportions of patients with each condition
at each of the four study sites were similar; in total,
270 participants (51%) presented with low back pain,
92 (17%) with migraine, and 166 (31%) with ankle
sprain. Patients were distributed equallyacross thethree
intervention arms, and there were no differences in pain
scores or demographic characteristics between the
groups at baseline (Box 2, Box 3).
The low back pain and ankle sprain groups, but not the
migraine group, were powered at 80% for both
equivalence and non-inferiority testing (based on
recruitment numbers). Equivalence and non-inferiority
of treatment groups was found overall and for the low
back pain and ankle sprain groups in both ITT and PP
analyses, except in the PP equivalence testing of the
ankle sprain group. For the migraine group, neither the
ITT nor the PP analyses indicated equivalence, nor did
the ITT analysis indicate non-inferiority (Box 4, Box 5).
Sensitivity analysis, which excluded those who received rescue
therapy from the PP analysis, yielded similar results.
Between T0 and T1, the overall pain score decreased by a mean 2.1
VNRS units (SD, 2.3) to a mean T1 score of 6.4 units (SD, 2.7), with
no statistically significant differences between treatment groups
(Box 6). Overall, 16% of patients had clinically relevant pain relief
and 36.9% statistically relevant pain relief at T1, with no statisti-
cally significant differences between the three groups (Box 6).
There were no significant differences between the groups in the
frequency of adverse events, acceptability, or health resource use
(Box 6). At T1, 47% of the acupuncture only group, 49% of the
combined group, and 57% of the pharmacotherapy only group

 stated they would definitely repeat their treatment. At T48, the
number of patients willing to repeat acupuncture had increased,
with 61% of the acupuncture only group willing to repeat their
treatment, compared with 57% of the combined therapy group,
and 52% of the pharmacotherapy only group (Box 6).
The two private hospitals were more likely to admit the treated
patients than the two public hospitals (34.0% v 11.6%; P < 0.001).
The overall admission frequencies by pain type were 2.2% for ankle
sprain, 15.3% for migraine, and 21.7% for low back pain (P < 0.001).
The acupuncture only group received significantly more rescue
medication therapy than the groups that received pharmaco-
therapy (at T1: P ¼ 0.16; after T1: P ¼ 0.008; Box 7). Oral opiate
medication was offered as first line rescue medication to patients in
the acupuncture group and parenteral opiates to the two
pharmacotherapy groups. The overall mean functional disability
scores decreased significantly between T0 and T48 in all groups
(P < 0.001), with no significant differences between groups over
time (Box 7).
Discussion
This study was the largest randomised controlled trial of
acupuncture in an ED. We found that acupuncture, alone or
in
conjunction
with
pharmacotherapy,
provides
analgesia
comparable with that achieved by pharmacotherapy for patients
presenting to the ED with low back pain and ankle sprain, but
not for those with migraine. Pain for many patients was not
adequately managed at T1 by any of the interventions. Across the
three arms, fewer than 40% of participants experienced a reduction
in pain of 2 points or more (ie, statistically relevant), and at T1 more
than 80% of patients had a pain rating above 4.
Although the three treatments were similarly ineffective at
reducing pain at T1, most patients found their treatment acceptable
at T48, about 80% of each group stating they would probably or
definitely repeat their treatment. This is consistent with recent
research that suggests the informational value of pain scores in ED
settings is limited, and that patient satisfaction is not necessarily
correlated with reduced pain scores.3 It is also notable that the
proportion of participants receiving acupuncture alone who were
satisfied with their treatment increased from 47% at T1 to 61% at
T48, whereas the proportion of those receiving pharmacotherapy
declined from 57% to 52%. The T48 figures are arguably more
important than T1 measures, as they are less likely to be
confounded by the time of analgesia onset and uncertainty about
the length of stay, transport arrangements and other factors.
While pain reduction at T1 was similar for all three groups, patients
in the acupuncture group were almost twice as likely to receive
rescue analgesia. This may indicate that acupuncture was ineffec-
tive and patients sought alternative analgesia or that they were
more likely to accept pharmacotherapy because they felt they had
missed out on standard care, whereas patients who had already
received oral opiates were reluctant to accept parenteral opiates.
Patients treated with acupuncture who received rescue medication
were classified as having received pharmacotherapy in the PP
analysis, in which the equivalence and non-inferiority of groups
were maintained, but we cannot discount the possibility that this
may partly reflect the potentially self-limiting nature of the treated
conditions.
As four sites participated in our study, including two large private
and two large public hospitals in diverse geographic and socio-
economic areas, our results should be generalisable to the
broader Australian ED patient population. Our study included
patients
presenting
with
acute
pain
caused
by
different
pathophysiological
processes
(musculoskeletal,
vascular,
traumatic), but our results may not apply to other painful condi-
tions. Acupuncture may induce analgesic effects similar to those of
some pharmacological agents, but it may also have additional
non-specific effects, modulated by patients’ perceptions and
expectations.25 As this was a pragmatic study designed for an ED

considerations
prevented
controlling for non-specific effects by including a placebo group.
There is a clear demand for analgesia in the ED and a multimodal
approach is desirable given concerns about the use of opioids and
the potential for addiction. Some Australian EDs already offer
acupuncture as an alternative when trained staff are available, and
the relative efficacy, acceptability and safety of acupuncture
support its playing a role in non-pharmacological analgesia in
acute care settings. Acupuncture may also improve patient satis-
faction by providing analgesia to patients with contraindications
for certain drugs, and for those who prefer acupuncture. Pain
management in EDs in general must be improved. The potential
role of acupuncture should also be further explored, including
determining the conditions in which it is most useful and the
feasibility of employing it in emergency settings, including
acupuncture training for emergency physicians and allied health
personnel.

 Conclusion
Neither acupuncture nor standard pharmacotherapy afforded
patients presenting to EDs with back pain, ankle injury or migraine
clinically relevant reduction in pain within an hour. Nevertheless,
patients found both treatments acceptable, and the effectiveness of
acupuncture alone was comparable with that of pharmacotherapy.
Our finding that acupuncture was a safe and acceptable form of
acute analgesia suggests it may be useful as an adjunct to phar-
macotherapy or when pharmacotherapy is unsuitable. However,
as no therapy provided optimal acute analgesia, more effective
options are needed.
