The spread of cancer cells from primary tumors to regional lymph nodes is often
associated with reduced survival. One prevailing model to explain this association posits
that fatal, distant metastases are seeded by lymph node metastases. This view provides
a mechanistic basis for the TNM staging system and is the rationale for surgical resection
of tumor-draining lymph nodes. Here we examine the evolutionary relationship between
primary tumor, lymph node, and distant metastases in human colorectal cancer. Studying
213 archival biopsy samples from 17 patients, we used somatic variants in hypermutable
DNA regions to reconstruct high-confidence phylogenetic trees. We found that in 65%
of cases, lymphatic and distant metastases arose from independent subclones in the
primary tumor, whereas in 35% of cases they shared common subclonal origin. Therefore,
two different lineage relationships between lymphatic and distant metastases exist in
colorectal cancer.
T
he spread of cancer cells from the primary
tumor to regional lymph nodes is one of
the most important factors predicting sur-
vival in patients with epithelial cancers (1).
Lymph node metastasis uniformly asso-
ciates with worse outcomes in breast (2), pros-
tate (3), lung (4), and colorectal cancer (5), the
most frequent cancers in the U.S. population.
In colorectal carcinoma, the presence of cancer
cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes defines
stage III disease and triggers administration of
adjuvant chemotherapy (6). The 5-year survival for
patients with stage II (no lymph node metastases)
is 82.5%, in contrast to 59.5% for patients with
stage III disease (7).
In most patients, lymph node metastasis is not
the cause of death but is correlated with spread
to vital organs (8). The association between lym-
phatic and distant metastasis has been known
for at least 150 years (9) and, together with the
observation that lymph node disease often pre-
cedes systemic disease, has engendered the view
that affected lymph nodes may give rise to dis-
tant metastases (10–12). The concept of such a
sequential progression or metastatic cascade (13),
in which the primary tumor (T) seeds lymph
node metastases (N) that in turn seed distant
metastases (M), provides a mechanistic basis
for the TNM staging system. A corollary of the
sequential-progression model is that surgical
resection of positive lymph nodes will reduce
recurrence rates. Indeed, resection of regional
lymph nodes has been performed for more
than 100 years (14). More recently, a number of
clinical trials have shown that lymph node re-
moval does not always improve patient survival
(15). These findings have inspired the alterna-
tive view that lymph node metastases do not
give rise to distant metastases (16) and sug-
gest that treatment strategies may need to be
reevaluated (17).
Given its potential impact on patient care, a
better understanding of the evolutionary re-
lationshipbetweenlymphnodeanddistantmetas-
tases is critical. We still do not know whether a
single metastatic subclone evolves in the primary
tumor, subsequently spreading to lymph nodes
and distant sites (18–21), or whether multiple
subclones in the primary tumor independently
seed lymphatic and distant metastases (22–24).
Here we begin to examine these questions by
studying the evolutionary history of colorectal
cancer metastases.
Insertion and deletion mutations
(indels) in hypermutable DNA enable
reconstruction of tumor phylogenies
We conducted a systematic review of 1373 patient
records and diagnostic materials at Massachu-
setts General Hospital (MGH) (fig. S1) and ini-
tially identified 19 colorectal cancer patients
for whom formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
samples from primary tumors, lymph nodes,
and distant metastases were available (Fig. 1A).
We collected multiple tumor regions for each
patient (mean 12.6, range 7 to 29) for a total of
239 samples [92 primary tumor biopsies, 59 lymph
node metastases, 52 distant metastases, 36 normal
tissue (germline) samples] (table S1). Of the 19
patients, 17 had liver metastases, 1 had an ovary
metastasis, and 1 had multiple metastases in the
omentum.
To trace the evolution of these cancers, we
used a methodology (25) that leverages indel
mutations in hypermutable, noncoding polygua-
nine repeats (fig. S2). The mutation rate of poly-
guanine repeats is several orders of magnitude
greater than the mutation rate of nonrepetitive
DNA (26), making these sequences a rich res-
ervoir of neutral somatic variation. Previous work
has shown that indels in polyguanine repeats
(27), as well as other microsatellites (28), ac-
curately reconstruct evolutionary events modeled
in cell culture. Furthermore, in silico models of
polyguanine-tract evolution have demonstrated
that revertant or parallel mutations do not nota-
bly affect phylogenetic reconstruction accuracy
when the number of interrogated markers is
larger than 10 (29). These properties make poly-
guanine tracts attractive tools for phylogenetic
analyses. Here, the mutation information from
20 to 43 polyguanine markers was generally suf-
ficient to resolve lineages at our chosen confi-
dence threshold (clade confidence > 70%, figs.
S3 and S4). Polyguanine markers were distributed
across many chromosomes (table S2). Therefore,
any individual chromosomal alteration (gain or
loss) would not be expected to substantially in-
fluence phylogenetic reconstruction. In total, our
data set consisted of 19,541 individual genotypes.
We developed a fully automated pipeline for data
filtering, noise reduction, and phylogenetic re-
construction (supplementary methods). First, to
avoid artifacts created by contamination with nor-
mal cells, we implemented rigorous purity crite-
ria, eliminating 11% of specimens from our study
(fig. S5 and table S1). For all specimens belonging
to the same patient, we then calculated a pairwise
distance measure, the Jensen-Shannon distance
(JSD) (30), over all polyguanine repeats. This
distance reflected how much the samples had
genetically diverged and formed the basis of our
phylogenetic reconstruction with the neighbor-
joining method (31).
Indel mutation patterns in the colorectal can-
cer cohort differed among patients. Of all observed
alterations, 81% were deletions and 19% were
insertions. A 4:1 ratio of deletions to insertions
has previously been described by us and others
(25, 32), indicating that it is an inherent property
of polyguanine repeats. However, among indi-
vidual cancers, we observed a relatively wide
range of deletion frequencies, ranging from 45%
in patient C69 to 100% in patient C77 (fig. S6).
This suggests that additional determinants, such
as alterations in specific DNA repair proteins,
may contribute to a skewing of mutation patterns
in individual tumors. For example, a cancer show-
ing microsatellite instability due to loss of MLH1
protein expression almost exclusively harbored

 deletions (Fig. 1B) that also were of a considerably
larger size than deletions in microsatellite-stable
tumors (Fig. 1C and fig. S6).
Next, we explored whether accumulation of
polyguanine indels is a cancer-related process
or whether these mutations can be found in
age-matched normal intestinal stem cells (ISCs).
We analyzed DNA from 18 clonal expansions
of human ISCs. Stem cell donors for 12 of these
expansions were children (ages 4 to 14), and
6 expansions were from a 66-year-old adult
(fig. S7). Adult ISCs had diverged significantly
farther from a polyclonal germline reference
than ISCs from children (Fig. 2A), suggesting
that polyguanine indels accumulate in normal
ISCs. We also observed a significant correla-
tion between clonal mutation frequency and pa-
tient age in our colorectal cancer cohort (fig. S8).

 The mean clonal mutation frequency in nor-
mal ISCs from the 66-year-old donor was lower
than the mean frequency in cancers from age-
matched (50- to 69-year-old) patients (Fig. 2B),
but with considerable overlap of the two distribu-
tions. The baseline polyguanine mutation bur-
den of a colorectal cancer, therefore, partially
consists of alterations that are present in all in-
testinal cells.
Two distinct patterns of metastatic
dissemination exist in colorectal cancer
The main goal of our study was to illuminate the
evolutionary relationship between lymphatic and
distant metastases. We aimed to sample lymph
nodes as comprehensively as possible and in-
cluded 91.3% of resected positive nodes in our
analysis (fig. S9, see supplementary methods for
a detailed description of lymph node inclusion
criteria). We first investigated the genetic distances
among lymph node metastases, primary tumor
biopsies, and distant metastases. For 33 of 45
(73%) lymph node metastases, the distance to the
primary tumor (Fig. 2C) was shorter than the dis-
tance to distant metastases, and 31 of 45 (69%)
distant metastases had a shorter genetic distance
to the primary tumor than to any lymph node
metastasis (Fig. 2D). This indicates that both
types of metastatic lesions likely originated from
distinct subclones in the primary tumor in most
cases. To test this hypothesis, we examined all
phylogenetic trees according to formal criteria.
Patients were classified into two categories on
the basis of tree topology (Fig. 2E). We reasoned
that lymph node and distant metastases had a
common origin if a patient’s tree contained a
clade that included at least one lymph node and
at least one distant metastasis but no primary
tumor samples. Existence of such a branch indi-
cates that both types of metastases were seeded
from the same subclone, or that lymph node metas-
tases gave rise to distant metastases. Formally, the
reverse—seeding of lymphatic metastases from
distant metastases—is also possible. A patient
was classified as having distinct origins of lym-
phatic and distant metastases if no such clade
existed. In all distinct origin cases, lymphatic and
distant metastases were each more closely related
to a primary tumor region than to each other.
To assess the robustness of each tumor’s origin
classification, we employed a bootstrapping strat-
egy. We performed repeated random sampling
(n = 1000) of a tumor’s mutation data to deter-
mine whether our origin classification was sensitive
to changes in a limited number of polyguanine
markers (supplementary methods). Of the 17 tu-
mors sampled, 14 (82%) were classified with a
bootstrap value above 80% (Fig. 2F), confirming
the robustness of our phylogenetic data and clas-
sification scheme. We also evaluated our clas-
sification by utilizing the unweighted pair-group
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) (33). (The
nature of polyguanine genotyping data suggests
the use of distance-based phylogenetic methods;
see supplementary methods). Origin classification
outcomes did not change for any of our 17 patients,
further demonstrating the reliability of our results
(all phylogenetic trees are available at Dryad:
http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vv53d).
Common origin of lymphatic and
distant metastases
In 6 out of 17 tumors (35%), we found a common
origin of lymphatic and distant metastases.
Selected phylogenetic trees with a classification
confidence score above 80% for common origin
are displayed in Fig. 3, along with pertinent
clinical information.
Patient C38’s cancer (Fig. 3A and anatomical
sketch in Fig. 1B) spread to the omentum and to
the mesenteric lymph nodes. Furthermore, sev-
eral satellite nodules had formed within the co-
lonic epithelium, spatially separated from the
primary tumor. We also investigated a piece of
tumor that had invaded a vein. Notably, phylo-
genetic reconstruction showed that all lesions
whose formation had depended on cell migra-
tion (that is, the satellite nodules, the distant
and lymph node metastases, and the tumor with-
in the vein) shared common ancestry, where-
as the primary tumor had a divergent genetic
profile.
Patient C69’s cancer (Fig. 3B) showed a similar
pattern, with one metastatic subclone giving rise
to several liver metastases and a lymph node
metastasis. Polyguanine indels clearly attributed
all metastases to the same evolutionary branch,

 even though M1, M2, and L1 were resected sev-
eral months earlier than M3 and the patient re-
ceived chemotherapy and bevacizumab between
surgeries (M and L indicate distant metastases
and lymph node metastases, respectively).
Patient C58 (Fig. 3C and the anatomical sketch
in Fig. 1C) had widespread metastases to the mes-
enteric lymph nodes and the liver. Most lymph
nodemetastaseswerecloselyrelatedtotheprimary
tumor. However, a distinct subclone had formed
in several lymph nodes that were located in close
anatomical proximity (L3, L5, L6). The liver me-
tastasis derived from the same subclone found in
this lymph node group.
Further examples of patients with a common
origin of lymphatic and distant metastases are
shown in Fig. 3D and fig. S3. In all common
origin cases, tree topologies are consistent with
one of two modes of dissemination: The primary
tumor seeded lymph node metastases, which in
turn seeded distant metastases, with the formal
possibility of the reverse; or one genetically dis-
tinct ancestor evolved within the primary tumor
and subsequently colonized lymph nodes and
distant sites. In both scenarios, lymphatic and
distant metastases share a common origin.
The common origin category is compatible
with the idea of sequential progression and can
explain important clinical observations, such as the
well-established correlation between lymphatic
and distant disease. In a majority of patients, how-
ever, tree topologies indicated independent seed-
ing of lymphatic and distant metastasis from the
primary tumor.
Distinct origins of lymphatic and
distant metastases
Cancers in the distinct origins group, which en-
compassed 11 out of 17 patients (65%), contained
multiple, genetically distinct metastasis ancestors.
Figure 4 shows selected phylogenetic trees with
a distinct origin–classification confidence score
above 80% (the complete set, along with confi-
dence values for each clade, is provided in fig. S4).
Patient C66’s tumor (Fig. 4A) is a represen-
tative example of the distinct origins category.
The cancer harbored multiple subclones at dif-
ferent stages of evolution that had seeded genet-
ically distinct metastases. Area P2, for example,
was most closely related to lymph node metas-
tasis L3, whereas area P1 was the origin of liver
metastases M1 and M2 (P indicates primary tu-
mor). The tree shows that lymph node metastases
were seeded continuously throughout the devel-
opment of the tumor but did not metastasize
further. Conversely, the liver metastases arose in
later evolution stages from the genetically most
advanced clone. They constitute the terminal,
most mutation-rich branch of the tree and, as
a group, are more homogeneous than the lymph
node metastases.
Patient C12’s tumor (Fig. 4B) partially resem-
bled that of patient C58. Its phylogenetic tree
also showed a group of lymph node metastases
(L2, L3, L4) that either derived from the same
ancestral clone or gave rise to each other, where-
as other lymphatic lesions (L1) were seeded inde-
pendently. Notably, as for patient C58, the closely
related nodes also were in anatomical proximity.
However, the patient’s liver metastasis (M1) did
not arise from this subclone but instead had
distinct origins in primary tumor area P8.
Another noteworthy case from the distinct ori-
gins group is patient C53 (Fig. 4C), who underwent
resection of two metastases located in the right
liver lobe and one metastasis in the left liver
lobe. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the
metastases in the right liver diverged relatively
early. After their divergence, the primary tumor
evolved further and independently gave rise to
lymph node metastasis L1 and the left liver me-
tastasis M3.
Further examples of cancers in the distinct
origins category are shown in Fig. 4, D to F,

 and fig. S4. In all these cases, the phylogenetic
data indicate that lymph node metastases were
not the source of distant metastases (also see ex-
planatory schematic in fig. S10).
Common clinicopathological
variables do not correlate with
origin classification
Next, we examined whether our origin classi-
fication was correlated with (and thus poten-
tially influenced by) any clinicopathological
variables. We did not observe any significant
differences in the number of positive nodes,
the ratio of positive to examined nodes, the
number of lymph nodes included in the final
data set, the number of excluded nodes (fig.
S11, A to D), the number of sampled primary
tumor regions, the percentage of T3 versus T4
stage patients (no T1 or T2 stage tumors were
part of this cohort), the distribution of primary
tumor sizes, the presence of vascular invasion,
or the fraction of patients with synchronous ver-
sus metachronous distant metastasis (fig. S12, A
to E) between origin categories.
Most importantly, we found no association
between origin and treatment history. Only
one patient (C77) had neoadjuvant chemother-
apy (table S3). In six patients, distant metastases
were resected after the primary tumor and the
lymph node metastases had already been re-
moved, and all received treatment in the inter-
vening time interval. Three of these patients
(C69, C65, C36) fell into the common origins and
three (C66, C39, C63) into the distinct origins
category (P = 0.6).
Discussion
The presence of lymph node metastases is an
important prognostic factor for most cancers,
but the underlying reason has been unclear.
One prevailing model posits that lymph node
metastases are precursors of distant metastases,
and their surgical resection is necessary to attain
a “cancer-free” state (34). An alternative model
posits that distant metastases arise independently
of lymph node metastases (16).
Our data show that lymph node metastases
and distant metastases indeed often do have a
common origin. Although our phylogenies do
not allow us to distinguish between sequential
progression and common-subclonal origin, many
phylogenies in the common origin category are
compatible with seeding of distant metastases
from lymph nodes.
However, in a majority of patients, we find
strong evidence of independent origins of lymph
node and distant lesions. If independent seeding
is prevalent, what is the reason for the associa-
tion of lymphatic and distant metastasis? It could
be that the association is driven by the common
origin subset of patients. An alternative possibility
is that most cells in tumors belonging to the dis-
tinct origins category have the ability to metas-
tasize. In such tumors, all cells that disseminate
would have an increased likelihood of colonizing
distant sites (35). Establishing lymph node metas-
tases may be a more efficient process than es-
tablishing distant metastases and may therefore
happen earlier and more frequently. This model
would also be compatible with clinical obser-
vations, including the correlation between lym-
phatic and distant metastasis, the sometimes

 modest benefits of lymphadenectomy, and the
advantage of early primary resection (assuming
that even in such highly metastatic cancers, the
survival rate of disseminated cells is relatively low,
so that the tumor needs to grow to a certain size
in order to metastasize efficiently).
Most metastases in our cohort were resected
from the liver, which is the most frequent distant
site of colorectal metastasis (36). Because venous
blood from the intestines reaches the liver di-
rectly through the portal vein, it is possible that
liver metastases are preferentially seeded hema-
togenously. Cancer cells that migrate through
lymph nodes enter the venous circulation in the
subclavian vein. The first capillary bed that such
cells encounter is the lung. It is therefore possible
that lung metastases are more frequently seeded
through the lymph nodes.
All cancers in our study were retrospectively
collected specimens. Archival samples are mostly
not suitable for whole-genome or exome sequenc-
ing because patient consent for such comprehen-
sive genetic profiling was not obtained at the
time of surgery. Conversely, polyguanine-repeat
genotyping is a limited analysis of length poly-
morphisms in noncoding DNA. It does not produce
any information about functional or disease-
related genes. Raw data produced by our method
contain the lengths of polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) amplicons in arbitrary units, allowing for
complete disclosure of mutation information while
making patient identification impossible. There-
fore, polyguanine-repeat analysis represents a
safe and effective method for studying tumor
evolution in a patient population that would
otherwise be inaccessible.
We conclude that the evolutionary relation-
ship between lymphatic and distant metastases
can take on two different forms in colorectal
cancer. In the future, it will be important to de-
termine whether cancers in the common and
distinct origin categories exhibit different clin-
ical behaviors.
