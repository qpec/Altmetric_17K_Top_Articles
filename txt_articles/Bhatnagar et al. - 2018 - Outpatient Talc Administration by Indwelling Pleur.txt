BACKGROUND
Malignant pleural effusion affects more than 750,000 persons each year across Eu-
rope and the United States. Pleurodesis with the administration of talc in hospital-
ized patients is the most common treatment, but indwelling pleural catheters placed 
for drainage offer an ambulatory alternative. We examined whether talc administered 
through an indwelling pleural catheter was more effective at inducing pleurodesis 
than the use of an indwelling pleural catheter alone.
METHODS
Over a period of 4 years, we recruited patients with malignant pleural effusion at 18 
centers in the United Kingdom. After the insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter, 
patients underwent drainage regularly on an outpatient basis. If there was no evi-
dence of substantial lung entrapment (nonexpandable lung, in which lung expansion 
and pleural apposition are not possible because of visceral fibrosis or bronchial ob-
struction) at 10 days, patients were randomly assigned to receive either 4 g of talc 
slurry or placebo through the indwelling pleural catheter on an outpatient basis. Talc 
or placebo was administered on a single-blind basis. Follow-up lasted for 70 days. 
The primary outcome was successful pleurodesis at day 35 after randomization.
RESULTS
The target of 154 patients undergoing randomization was reached after 584 patients 
were approached. At day 35, a total of 30 of 69 patients (43%) in the talc group had 
successful pleurodesis, as compared with 16 of 70 (23%) in the placebo group (haz-
ard ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 3.92; P 
= 
0.008). No significant be-
tween-group differences in effusion size and complexity, number of inpatient days, 
mortality, or number of adverse events were identified. No significant excess of 
blockages of the indwelling pleural catheter was noted in the talc group.
CONCLUSIONS
Among patients without substantial lung entrapment, the outpatient administration 
of talc through an indwelling pleural catheter for the treatment of malignant pleural 
effusion resulted in a significantly higher chance of pleurodesis at 35 days than an 
indwelling catheter alone, with no deleterious effects. (Funded by Becton Dickinson;

M
alignant pleural effusion is es-
timated to affect more than 750,000 
persons each year across Europe and 
the United States.1 Malignant pleural effusion is 
usually the result of the spread of metastatic 
cancer and commonly leads to debilitating symp-
toms and to multiple interventions as fluid recurs.2
Historically, the preferred approach in the 
treatment of malignant pleural effusion has in-
volved inducing pleurodesis,2,3 with recent data 
from a meta-analysis confirming that talc is 
likely to be the most efficacious agent for this 
process.4 The primary disadvantage of chemical 
pleurodesis is that it usually involves an inpatient 
stay of 4 to 7 days that,5,6 in patients receiving 
palliative treatment for malignant pleural effu-
sion, may represent a substantial proportion of 
a patient’s remaining life.7
Indwelling pleural catheters offer an ambula-
tory alternative for fluid management and are 
now routinely inserted as day-case procedures 
(i.e., with the intervention and discharge occur-
ring on the same day). Used in isolation, these 
catheters have been shown to be as good as 
traditional approaches in managing symptoms 
in patients,5 but they do not confer the same 
likelihood of pleurodesis, although pleurodesis 
has been reported to happen spontaneously at 
rates as disparate as 16% and 65% among pa-
tients with malignant pleural effusion.8,9
In a noncomparative series involving 22 pa-
tients, the administration of talc through an 
indwelling pleural catheter suggested that high 
rates of pleurodesis were achievable.10 In the 
present trial, we tested the hypothesis that a 
combination of talc and indwelling pleural cath-
eter would enhance the probability of successful 
pleurodesis, as compared with the use of an in-
dwelling pleural catheter alone.
Methods
Trial Design
The IPC–Plus trial was a randomized, placebo-
controlled, single-blind, parallel-group trial. The 
trial was supported by an unrestricted research 
grant from Becton Dickinson, which also sup-
plied PleurX catheters and drainage bottles for 
all the participants. The trial design, implemen-
tation, and data collection and analysis were 
performed solely by the trial investigators with-
out commercial involvement. The authors wrote 
the manuscript and made the decision to submit 
it for publication without commercial involve-
ment. The authors vouch for the accuracy and 
completeness of the data and for the fidelity of 
the trial to the protocol (available with the full 
text of this article at NEJM.org).
North Bristol NHS Trust provided trial over-
sight. Ethics approval for recruitment was ob-
tained from the South Central (Oxford A) Re-
search Ethics Committee and from the Medicines 
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. De-
tails regarding trial oversight are provided in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Trial Setting and Participants
The trial recruited patients from 18 secondary 
and tertiary care centers in the United Kingdom. 
Potential participants were identified and screened 
at local centers offering routine pleural services. 
Patients were eligible if they had a confirmed 
diagnosis of symptomatic malignant pleural effu-
sion for which the patient had elected treatment 
with an indwelling pleural catheter. In addition, 
participants had to have an expected survival of 
more than 2 months (as judged by a local investi-
gator) and an expected Eastern Cooperative On-
cology Group performance-status score of 2 or 
less (on a scale from 0 to 4, with higher scores 
indicating greater disability) after fluid removal. 
Key exclusion criteria were an age younger than 
18 years, extensive lung entrapment (nonexpand-
able lung, in which lung expansion and pleural 
apposition are not possible because of visceral 
fibrosis or bronchial obstruction) or fluid locu-
lation, ipsilateral attempt at pleurodesis within 
the previous 8 weeks, and any contraindication 
to the trial procedures (see the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Enrollment, Randomization, and Blinding
All the participants provided written informed 
consent. After enrollment, patients underwent 
insertion of an indwelling pleural catheter while 
they were under local anesthesia; maximal fluid 
drainage occurred at the time of catheter place-
ment, as limited by symptoms. Patients were 
discharged home the same day, and a minimum 
of three further drainages, limited to 1 liter each, 
took place before review at day 10 after the inser-
tion of the catheter. Drainage took place at home 
 n engl j med 378;14 nejm.org April 5, 2018
1315
Outpatient Talc Administration for Malignant Effusion
with the assistance of a community nurse or at 
an outpatient clinic or trial center. Participants 
then underwent maximal drainage once more at 
a trial center before undergoing radiography of 
the chest. On the basis of visual estimation, pa-
tients who had evidence of less than 75% pleural 
apposition on a radiograph of the chest or who 
had more than one third opacification due to 
fluid (as estimated with the use of thoracic ultra-
sonography) were considered to be ineligible.
Participants underwent randomization with 
the use of a centralized, computer-based system. 
Trial-group assignments were made in a 1:1 ratio, 
with the use of minimization11 with a random 
component of 80%. The minimization variables 
were the following: type of cancer (breast or 
ovarian cancer vs. mesothelioma vs. other), the 
total volume of pleural fluid drained between 
enrollment and randomization (<2 liters vs. ≥2 
liters), and the appearance on the chest radio-
graph obtained at day 10 (no lung entrapment 
vs. some entrapment but the patient was still 
eligible for randomization).
The trial was conducted on a single-blind 
basis. Trial-group assignments were known only 
to the local clinical team, and talc or placebo 
was administered through the indwelling pleural 
catheter immediately after randomization. Partici-
pants remained unaware of their group assign-
ment throughout the follow-up period. Commu-
nity nurses who recorded the drainage volumes 
that were used to assess the primary outcome 
were also unaware of the trial-group assignments.
Interventions
According to standard clinical practice, all the 
participants received a dose of intrapleural lido-
caine, adjusted for body weight, before the ad-
ministration of talc or placebo. Patients in the 
placebo group received 50 ml of intrapleural 
sodium chloride 0.9% solution as a control mate-
rial through the indwelling pleural catheter. Pa-
tients in the talc group received a U.K. guideline–
recommended dose of 4 g of sterile, graded talc 
(Steritalc, Novatech),2 which had been made into 
a slurry before instillation with 50 ml of sodium 
chloride 0.9% solution. Although the two solu-
tions were visibly distinct, participants remained 
unaware of the trial-group assignment owing to 
the use of opaque syringes and to the fact that 
talc or placebo was administered in a manner 
such that the patients could not see the proce-
dure (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Participants were discharged after a 2-hour 
minimum period of observation, and the next 
drainage took place between 12 and 36 hours 
after the administration of talc or placebo. Sub-
sequent drainage frequency was determined by 
the local investigating team but was at least 
twice per week for the duration of the trial.
Follow-up
Patients were followed for trial outcomes until 
70 days after randomization or until death (which-
ever occurred first). Trial consultations took place 
every 14 days. The recording of maximal fluid 
drainage and radiography of the chest were under-
taken immediately before face-to-face assess-
ments, which were performed by members of 
the local trial teams. All decisions regarding a 
participant’s overall care, including whether to 
remove an indwelling pleural catheter, were at the 
discretion of the treating clinicians at each center.
Primary Outcome
The primary-outcome measure was the propor-
tion of participants with successful pleurodesis 
at day 35 after randomization. Pleurodesis was 
declared to be a success if two objective criteria 
were met: if less than 50 ml of fluid was drained 
on three consecutive occasions through the 
indwelling pleural catheter; and if a radiograph 
of the chest that was taken after these drainages 
showed less than 25% opacification of the appro-
priate hemithorax due to suspected fluid. The 
interpretation of radiographs was performed 
by two independent pulmonologists who were 
unaware of the trial-group assignments (see the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes included participant-reported 
health-related quality of life as measured with 
the use of the EuroQoL Group 5-Dimensions 
5-Level Questionnaire12 (EQ-5D-5L; scores on the 
descriptive index range from −0.59 to 1.00, and 
scores on the visual-analogue scale range from 
0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better 
quality of life) and the European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality 
of Life Questionnaire–Core 30 (QLQ-C30)13 (the 
summary score ranges from 0 to 100, with a 
 n engl j med 378;14 nejm.org April 5, 2018

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
higher score indicating better quality of life); 
participant-reported dyspnea and chest pain as 
assessed by means of scores on a visual-analogue 
scale (on a scale from 0 to 100 mm, with a score 
of 0 indicating a complete absence of symptoms 
and a score of 100 maximum possible symp-
toms) that were recorded daily; the total volume of 
fluid drained between randomization and day 70; 
all-cause mortality up to day 70; the number of 
hospital inpatient days between randomization 
and day 70; the degree of pleural fluid complex-
ity (septation or loculation) as assessed with the 
use of thoracic ultrasonography; successful 
pleurodesis at day 70 (defined identically to suc-
cessful pleurodesis in the primary-outcome analy-
sis); successful pleurodesis at both day 35 and 
day 70, defined as less than a total of 250 ml of 
fluid being drained over a 2-week period; and 
the number of therapeutic pleural procedures that 
took place between randomization and day 70. 
Details regarding all adverse events and deaths 
during the trial were assessed initially by the 
local investigator and were then verified inde-
pendently by North Bristol NHS Trust, by the 
chief investigator, and finally by the data and 
safety monitoring committee. Details are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Previous studies have shown rates of successful 
pleurodesis of approximately 90% among patients 
who received talc slurry by means of traditional 
methods and up to 65% among those who used 
an indwelling pleural catheter alone.8,14 Assum-
ing a difference of at least 25 percentage points 
in the rates of participants who had successful 
pleurodesis at day 35 after randomization (85% 
in the talc group vs. 60% in the placebo group) 
and a 5% loss to follow-up, we calculated that 
154 participants (with randomization performed 
in a 1:1 ratio) would be required for the trial to 
have 90% power at a 5% significance level.
Analyses were performed with the use of 
Stata software, version 12 (StataCorp). The main 
analysis for each outcome was performed accord-
ing to the intention-to-treat principle; all the par-
ticipants with an observed outcome were included 
in the analysis according to their assigned trial 
group.15 All the analyses used minimization11 
variables as covariates in regression models.16,17 
All the tests were two-sided, and results were 
considered to be significant at the 5% level.
The primary outcome was analyzed with the 
use of a competing-risk time-to-event regression 
model, with death as the competing risk.18 Partici-
pants who did not die or have the primary out-
come had their data censored at day 35 after 
randomization or at the point of last contact.
The original statistical analysis plan stipu-
lated that an interim analysis for efficacy would 
take place after the randomization of 100 par-
ticipants and that a significance threshold of 
0.048 was required at final analysis.19 However, 
after good recruitment of participants, the trial 
steering committee and data and safety moni-
toring committee recommended that the trial 
continue to its original target of 154 participants 
undergoing randomization, without an interim 
analysis being performed. The trial protocol and 
statistical analysis plan were therefore amended, 
and a P value of less than 0.05 was considered to 
indicate statistical significance (see the Supple-
mentary Appendix).
Results
Recruitment and Population Characteristics
Recruitment and follow-up of the participants 
took place over a period of 4 years, from June 
2012 through December 2016. A total of 923 
potential participants were assessed for entry, 
584 were approached, and 307 were willing to 
consider enrollment. A total of 154 patients 
underwent randomization; 76 patients were as-
signed to the placebo group and 78 to the talc 
group, with 70 and 69 patients, respectively, con-
tributing data to the intention-to-treat analysis of 
the primary outcome (Fig. 1). During the course 
of the trial, 20 participants withdrew (10 from 
each group). The two trial groups were generally 
well matched at baseline, although an imbalance 
was seen among patients who were being treated 
with low-molecular-weight heparin (Table 1, and 
Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Primary Outcome
In the primary-outcome analysis, 30 of 69 pa-
tients (43%) in the talc group had successful 
pleurodesis by day 35, as compared with 16 of 70 
(23%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 2.20; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23 to 3.92; 
P 
= 
0.008). All the sensitivity analyses, including 
those that were performed to address missing 
data and the baseline imbalance in treatment 
with low-molecular-weight heparin, favored a 
beneficial effect from talc. The prespecified sub-

Secondary Outcomes
Additional Pleurodesis and Fluid-Drainage Outcomes
The rate of successful pleurodesis (according to 
the primary-outcome definition) at day 70 was 
51% (35 of 69 patients) in the talc group, as com-
pared with 27% (19 of 70 patients) in the placebo 
group (hazard ratio, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.31 to 3.85; 
P 
= 
0.003). The assessment of pleurodesis accord-
ing to the total volume of fluid drained over a 
period of 2 weeks also favored the talc group 
over the placebo group at day 35 (28 of 67 pa-
tients [42%] vs. 9 of 70 [13%]; hazard ratio, 3.78; 
95% CI, 1.81 to 7.90; P<0.001) and at day 70 (30 
of 66 patients [45%] vs. 11 of 69 [16%]; hazard 
ratio, 3.43; 95% CI, 1.74 to 6.75; P<0.001).

Outpatient Talc Administration for Malignant Effusion
The median volume of fluid that was drained 
between randomization and day 70 was 1350 ml 
(interquartile range, 340 to 5680) in the talc 
group and 3640 ml (interquartile range, 845 to 
7605) in the placebo group (P 
= 
0.36). A total of 
5 of 71 patients (7%) in the talc group underwent 
an additional therapeutic procedure for fluid 
management during the trial, as compared with 
2 of 73 (3%) in the placebo group (odds ratio, 
2.69; 95% CI, 0.50 to 14.34; P 
= 
0.25).
Quality of Life
Participants who received talc reported better 
quality-of-life scores than those who received 
placebo at all time points, with differences in 
the QLQ-C30 score reaching significance at day 
28 (difference, 9.2 points; 95% CI, 1.1 to 17.4; 
P 
= 
0.03) and day 42 (difference, 14.7 points; 95% 
CI, 5.9 to 23.5; P 
= 
0.001) and differences in the 
EQ-5D-5L score reaching significance at day 42 
only (difference, 0.12 points; 95% CI, 0.01 to 
0.22; P 
= 
0.03). Post hoc analysis of mean scores 
over the whole trial showed that the difference 
in means for the QLQ-C30 score was 6.9 points 
(95% CI, 1.2 to 12.6; P 
= 
0.02) and the difference 
in means for the EQ-5D-5L score was 0.07 points 
(95% CI, 0.00 to 0.14; P 
= 
0.04).
Symptoms
Participants who received talc had better symp-
tom scores at all assessment points during the 
trial, with significant differences in the mean 
scores on the visual-analogue scale for chest pain 
being seen at day 14 (difference, −5.4 points; 
95% CI, −10.7 to −0.1; P 
= 
0.04) and day 28 (dif-
ference, −6.8 points; 95% CI, −12.6 to −0.9; 
P 
= 
0.02) and significant differences in the mean 
scores on the visual-analogue scale for dyspnea 
being seen at day 56 (difference, −7.9 points; 
95% CI, −15.5 to −0.3; P 
= 
0.04). Post hoc analy-
sis of the mean scores over the trial revealed 
estimated treatment effects for talc of −5.7 
points (95% CI, −9.8 to −1.6) for chest pain 
(P 
= 
0.007) and −3.6 points (95% CI, −8.5 to 1.3) 
for dyspnea (P 
= 
0.15).
Effusion Complexity and Size
No significant between-group difference was seen 
in effusion size, as assessed by thoracic ultra-
sonography, during the trial. In addition, no sig-
nificant difference was observed in the degree of 
septation at any time point during the trial.
Duration of Hospital Stay
The mean (±SD) number of days that patients 
spent in the hospital until day 70 was 4.1±7.9 
days in the talc group and 3.0±5.2 days in the 
placebo group. The difference was not signifi-
cant (rate ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.50 to 2.70; 
P 
= 
0.74).
Mortality and Adverse Events
During the trial, 21 patients died (7 in the talc 
group and 14 in the placebo group). None of the 
deaths were attributed to the trial interventions. 
The odds ratio for death was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.17 
to 1.24) favoring the talc group, but this result 
was not significant (P 
= 
0.13).
No significant difference between the talc 
group and the placebo group was seen in the 
number of participants who had adverse events 
(odds ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.47 to 1.71; P 
= 
0.74), 
with 68% of the events (84 of 123 events) being 
considered to be unrelated to the trial after 
blinded independent review. The most common 
reported events were due to underlying disease 
progression or distant fluid accumulation. Block-
age of the indwelling pleural catheter occurred

Discussion
Our randomized trial compared the combination 
of talc and indwelling pleural catheter with pla-
cebo and indwelling pleural catheter in patients 
with malignant pleural effusion who were out-
patients. Our primary-outcome results, which 
were backed up by robust sensitivity analyses, 
strongly suggest that the administration of talc 
through an indwelling pleural catheter was sig-
nificantly more efficacious than the use of an 
indwelling pleural catheter alone among patients 
without substantial lung entrapment. Patients in 
the talc group were more than twice as likely as 
those in the placebo group to meet the criteria 
for successful pleurodesis. Success rates at day 
70 suggested that pleurodesis was maintained to 
a point that is clinically relevant for patients 
with short median survival.7
Although the use of an indwelling pleural 
catheter has been shown to lead to a reduction 
in symptoms,20 there are potential drawbacks to 
long-term treatment, including the inconvenience 
of regular drainage (with associated health care 
costs)21 and risks of infection.22 Previous data 
suggest an average incidence of spontaneous 
pleurodesis of approximately 45% (at approximate-
ly 2 months) when only an indwelling pleural 
catheter is used.20 However, Wahidi et al. recently 
examined the influence of frequency of drainage 
through an indwelling pleural catheter (daily vs. 
standard alternate day) in a population of pa-
tients with malignant pleural effusion in North

Outpatient Talc Administration for Malignant Effusion
America,9 and they found rates of successful 
pleurodesis at 12 weeks of 47% in the daily-
drainage group versus 24% in the standard-
drainage group. In addition, the rate of device 
removal in the indwelling-pleural-catheter group 
in the Australasian Malignant Pleural Effusion 
(AMPLE) trial was 28.8%.23 In combination with 
the results of our trial, these data imply that the 
true incidence of spontaneous pleurodesis is con-
siderably lower than the incidence that has been 
previously reported in retrospective case series.24,25
Approximately 40% of the patients who had 
undergone randomization had at least one ad-
verse event during the trial — an overall propor-
tion similar to that in the indwelling-pleural-
catheter group of the Second Therapeutic 
Intervention in Malignant Effusion (TIME2) trial.5 
However, the majority (68%) of the adverse events 
in our trial were considered to be unrelated to 
the intervention and tended to represent disease 
progression. We did not observe any excess in 
adverse events — specifically, blockage of the 
indwelling pleural catheter, fluid complexity, 
drainage complications, or death — in the talc 
group. This finding suggests that the adminis-
tration of talc through an indwelling pleural 
catheter in an outpatient setting was not detri-
mental, either to the patient or the device.
There are limitations to our trial. During the 
short but intense follow-up period, we assessed 
the early effects of the trial intervention, but we 
are unable to comment on the effects of the 
administration of talc through an indwelling 
pleural catheter beyond 70 days. In addition, it 
could be argued that our definition of pleurode-
sis, although pragmatic and easily reproducible, 
did not attempt to assess the true degree of 
visceroparietal adhesion formally — for exam-
ple, with the use of thoracic ultrasonography, an 
approach that although reported is not yet vali-
dated.10 Finally, because relatively high numbers 
of patients were excluded before randomization, 
the results we observed may apply to only a se-
lected group of patients with malignant pleural 
effusion.
In conclusion, our data showed that patients 
who had malignant pleural effusion without sub-
stantial lung entrapment and who chose treat-
ment with an indwelling pleural catheter had a 
greater chance of pleurodesis when talc admin-
istration was part of the treatment protocol than 
when the indwelling pleural catheter was used 
alone.
