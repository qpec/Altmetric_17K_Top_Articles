and body fatness in a UK cohort study

OBJECTIVE: To assess longitudinal associations between screen-based media use (television (TV) and computer hours, having a TV
in the bedroom) and body fatness among UK children.
METHODS: Participants were 12 556 children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study who were followed from age 7 to age 11 years.
Associations were assessed between screen-based media use and the following outcomes: body mass index (BMI), fat mass index
(FMI), and overweight.
RESULTS: In fully adjusted models, having a bedroom TV at age 7 years was associated with significantly higher BMI and FMI
(excess BMI for boys = 0.29, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06–0.52; excess BMI for girls = 0.57, 95% CI 0.31–0.84; excess FMI for
boys = 0.20, 95% CI 0.04–0.37; excess FMI for girls = 0.39, 95% CI 0.21–0.57) and increased risk of being overweight (relative risk (RR)
for boys = 1.21, 95% CI 1.07–1.36; RR for girls = 1.31, 95% CI 1.15–1.48) at age 11 years, compared with having no bedroom TV. Hours
spent watching TV or digital versatile disks were associated with increased risk of overweight among girls only. Computer use at
age 7 years was not related to later body fatness for either gender.
CONCLUSION: Having a TV in the child’s bedroom was an independent risk factor for overweight and increased body fatness in
this nationally representative sample of UK children. Childhood obesity prevention strategies should consider TVs in children’s
bedrooms as a risk factor for obesity.

INTRODUCTION
Screen-based media have a central role in the lives of today’s
children. As technology advances, children now have unparalleled
access not only to television (TV) screens but also to computers,
game consoles and mobile devices.1 In the United Kingdom, TV is
still the most consumed medium among children aged 5–11
years, with gaming coming second.2,3
At the same time, rising childhood obesity levels are a national
and global public health concern.4 In 2014/15, a third of 11-year-
old children in England were overweight and almost a fifth were
obese.5 Ironically, while our screens have become flatter, our
children have become fatter. Indeed, a relationship between TV
viewing and overweight among children and adolescents has
been repeatedly reported.6–13 There is some evidence that a TV in
the child’s bedroom might exacerbate the problem.8,14,15 Potential
pathways include snacking/eating calorie-dense foods while
watching TV,16–19 exposure to food advertising and product
placement16,17,20
and
reduced
or
disrupted
sleep.21–25
An
association between screen time and reduced physical activity
is
often
hypothesized
but
empirical
evidence
has
been
contradictory.12,26–28
UK research on screen use and overweight has so far been
mainly cross-sectional and has focused on TV viewing as one of
the several risk factors for overweight and obesity among young
children, with some conflicting results.29–32 Residual confounding
and reverse causality remain potential issues in the existing
literature, and little is known about the role of computer games.
Further, UK studies have so far relied mainly on body mass index
(BMI) as the outcome variable, or overweight and obesity derived
from BMI. However, using BMI alone is not the best way of
assessing
adiposity
or
body
fatness,
because
it
does
not
distinguish between fat mass and fat-free (lean) mass and can
therefore be affected by either. The fat mass index (FMI) is a
measure of fat mass (FM) adjusted for height (FM divided by
height squared) that is not confounded by fat-free mass33 and is
therefore a valuable additional indicator of body composition. In
this
study,
we
examine
longitudinal
associations
between
children’s screen based media use at age 7 years and their BMI,
FMI and overweight status at age 11 years while adjusting for a
wide range of covariates.
METHODS
Data
We analyzed data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS). The MCS is
a nationally representative, prospective cohort study that follows the lives
of children born between September 2000 and January 2002 in the four
countries of the United Kingdom. The sample is geographically clustered
and stratified to overrepresent economically disadvantaged areas, areas
with high proportions of people from ethnic minority backgrounds, and
the three smaller countries of the United Kingdom. The MCS is designed
and managed by the UK Centre for Longitudinal Studies (CLS) at the UCL
Institute of Education. The data sets are fully anonymized and available for
academic use from the UK Data Service.
Data are currently available from 5 waves, collected when the children
were 9 months, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years and 11 years. The initial MCS
sample at wave 1 included 18 552 families, another 692 families joined at
wave 2.34 At wave 5, 13 287 families participated (response rate 69%).35

 The MCS survey weights include unit non-response weights to adjust for
attrition between waves.
Ethical approval has been granted for each sweep of the MCS. For
wave 5, ethical approval was granted by the Yorkshire and Humber REC
(Ref: 11/YH/0203).34 All participants provided written informed consent.
Outcome variables: BMI, FMI, and overweight at age 11 years
The outcome of interest was adiposity (body fatness) at age 11 years,
measured via three indicators: BMI, FMI, and overweight. Physical
measurements of height, weight and body fat were collected by
interviewers who underwent formal training and accreditation. A detailed
description of the standardized measurement protocols and process of the
interviewer accreditation scheme is available for download from the CLS
website.36 In brief, children’s height was measured using a Leicester Height
Measure Stadiometers (Seca, Birmingham, UK), with the child’s head in the
Frankfurt Plane, and recorded to the nearest completed millimeter.
Children were asked to wear only light clothing and to remove shoes
and socks as well as hair accessories or hairstyles that could affect the
reading. Weight and body fat were measured using calibrated Tanita BF-
522W scales (Tanita UK, Yiewsley, Middlesex, UK) that were placed on a
firm, level surface. We used the derived BMI variable calculated by the CLS.
To calculate FMI, we used the following formulas: FM = weight times
percentage of body fat, divided by 100; FMI = FM divided by height
squared. BMI and FMI were used as continuous variables. Overweight was
a binary variable (non-overweight including healthy weight plus under-
weight vs overweight including obese), based on the age and sex-specific
International Obesity Task Force criteria.37
Screen-based media use at age 7 years
We measured screen-based media use at wave 4/age 7 years because it
was the first wave to include information on whether or not the child had a
TV in his/her bedroom. Three variables were used to measure children’s
screen-based media use at age 7 years: whether the child had a bedroom
TV; hours spent watching TV or digital versatile disks (DVDs; ‘On a normal
week day during term time, how many hours does [child] spend watching
television, videos or DVDs?’—o1 h, 1–3 h, 43 h); and hours spent playing
on the computer (‘On a normal weekday during term time, how many
hours does [child] spend using a computer or playing electronic games
outside school lessons?’—none, o1 h, ⩾ 1 h).
Covariates
The following covariates were included in the fully adjusted models
because they are known to be associated with childhood adiposity and
might confound the relationship with screen-based media use29,38,39: child
age, child BMI at wave 2/age 3 years, breastfeeding duration (never,
o4 months, ⩾ 4 months); child ethnicity (White, Mixed, Indian, Pakistani,
Bangladeshi, Black Caribbean, Black African, other); maternal BMI at wave
2; maternal education at wave 5 (Level 4/5 (degree or higher degree), Level
3 (2+A levels), Level 2 (5 General Certificate of Secondary Education A–C or
1A level), Level 1 (o5 General Certificate of Secondary Education D–E),
overseas qualification only, no qualifications); and family income at wave 5
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalized
income quintiles, missing data imputed by CLS). Children’s BMI at age 3
years was included to minimize the possibility of reverse causation. We
chose the earliest possible indicator of child BMI because screen use starts
long before age 7 years, and therefore using BMI/FMI from later waves
would likely result in overadjustment. Maternal BMI was used as a proxy
measure to capture the overall food environment in the household as well
as potential genetic influences. Again we wanted to use a measure from
the earliest possible time point. Because at wave 1 maternal BMI was still
influenced by the recent pregnancy, we used maternal BMI from wave 2.
Breastfeeding duration was included because it follows a strong social
gradient and has been linked to a reduced risk of childhood obesity.40
As potential mediating variables, we included bedtimes and markers of
physical activity at age 7 years. Bedtimes were assessed via the question
‘On weekdays during term time, does [child] go to bed at a regular time?
What time is that?’. Children were classified as having no fixed bedtime if
the answer to the first question was ‘no, never or almost never’ or
‘sometimes’, whereas for replies of ‘usually’ and ‘always’ bedtimes were
coded as follows: 1930 hours or earlier, between 1930 and 2000 hours,
between 2000 and 2030 hours, later than 2030 hours. Physical activity
outside school lessons was measured using the question ‘How many days
a week does [child] usually go to a club or class to do sport or any other
physical activity like swimming, gymnastics, football, dancing, etc.?’
Answers were categorized as: ⩾ 3 days per week, 2 days per week, 1day
per week, or less than once a week.
Study sample
Of the 13 112 children who participated in wave 5 of the MCS and were
eligible for this study, 12 556 had complete data on all three outcome
measures and were included in the analysis sample. We excluded 357
twins and triplets because the examined outcomes are moderated by
multiple gestation pregnancies.41 A flow diagram of the study participants
is shown in Figure 1.
Only 8147 children had complete data on all covariates. Missingness was
highest for maternal BMI at wave 2 (24%). Rates of missingness for all
variables are shown in Supplementary Table S1 (online Supplementary
Appendix). On average, families of children with missing data were more
disadvantaged: among children with missing data, 31% were living in
relative poverty (that is, on an income o60% of the median of the
population) and 36% of mothers had a university degree, while for those
with complete data these were 15% and 45%, respectively. We therefore
used multiple imputation by chained equations to handle missing data on
covariates due to item non-response.42 Imputations were carried out in
Stata version 14.1.43 The imputation model included all outcome variables,
covariates and MCS design variables. The following were included as
auxiliary variables: child BMI and FMI at wave 4/age 7 years; maternal
education and family income at wave 4; and maternal BMI at wave 5.
Preliminary analyses showed that child gender moderated associations
between BMI/FMI and the screen time variables (interaction terms
statistically significant). Where interactions are present, the stratify-then-
impute method is recommended as an ideal solution.44 We therefore
imputed 25 data sets for boys and girls separately. Results from imputed
data were largely similar to those obtained from complete case analyses.
We report results from analyses of the imputed data.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were carried out using Stata version 14.1.43 MCS survey
weights were employed throughout to account for the stratification and
geographical clustering of the data and attrition between the MCS waves.
Details on response rates and weighting have been reported elsewhere.45
After inspecting crude associations between the three outcome
measures and explanatory variables, we estimated a series of regression
models. For BMI and FMI, multivariable linear regression was used to
estimate associations with screen-based media use while adjusting for
potential mediating and confounding factors and BMI at age 3 years. For
overweight, we used Poisson regression to estimate relative risk (RR).
Poisson or log-binomial regression models are preferred for binary
outcomes when the outcome is common (prevalence 410%), because
in these cases odds ratios obtained from logistic regression can
significantly deviate from risk ratios (but are often interpreted as such)
and can therefore be misleading.46
We present all results stratified by child gender. For each of the three
outcome measures (BMI, FMI and overweight), Model 1 included the three
screen time variables and child age only. Model 2 further adjusted for child
BMI at age 3 years, breastfeeding duration, child ethnicity, maternal BMI at
wave 2 (continuous), maternal education at wave 5 and family income at
wave 5. Model 3 was the fully adjusted model, additionally including
bedtime and physical activity at age 7 years.

 RESULTS
Sample characteristics
The analyses included 12 556 singleton children (6353 boys and
6203 girls) with complete information on the three outcome
variables. The unweighted mean age of the analysis sample at
wave 5 (when the outcomes were measured) was 11.2 years
(s.e. = 0.33), and 50.6% were boys. The majority of the children
were White (84.6%).
Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1 and Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3 (online Supplementary Appendix). All means and
proportions shown in descriptive tables are weighted using MCS
survey weights. The mean BMI at age 11 years was 19.0 for boys
and 19.5 for girls, while mean FMI was 4.1 for boys and 5.0 for girls.
About 25% of boys and 30% of girls in the sample were
overweight at age 11 years. At age 7 years, 55% of boys and 53%
of girls had a TV in their bedroom. Average BMI and FMI, as well as
prevalence of overweight, were higher among children who had a
TV in the bedroom and among children who spent more time
watching TV or DVDs at age 7 years (Table 1).
Associations between screen-based media use at age 7 years and
adiposity at age 11 years
On average, children who had a TV in the bedroom at age 7 years
had a significantly higher BMI and FMI at age 11 years compared
with those with no bedroom TV (Model 1 in Table 2). Associations
appeared to be stronger for girls than for boys. Associations were
attenuated but remained statistically significant following adjust-
ment for covariates (Model 3 in Table 2). Excess BMI was 0.29
(95% confidence interval (CI) 0.06–0.52) for boys and 0.57 (95% CI
0.31–0.84) for girls; excess FMI was 0.20 (95% CI 0.04–0.37) for
boys and 0.39 (95% CI 0.21–0.57) for girls. Estimates changed very
little between Models 2 and 3, suggesting that bedtimes and
physical activity did not explain these associations. For boys, hours
spent watching TV/DVDs were not associated with BMI and FMI in
the adjusted analyses, while for girls, there were statistically
significant associations consistent with a dose–response relation-
ship (Models 2 and 3 in Table 2). Again there was only slight
attenuation after adjusting for bedtimes and physical activity.
Hours spent playing on the computer were not related to BMI or
FMI for either gender (Table 2).
Similarly, Poisson regression models (Table 3) showed that the
RR of being overweight at age 11 years was higher for children
who had a TV in their bedroom at age 7 years, compared with
those with no bedroom TV. Again associations were somewhat
stronger for girls (RR for boys = 1.21, 95% CI 1.07–1.36; RR for
girls = 1.31, 95% CI 1.15–1.48). After adjusting for covariates,
TV/DVD hours at age 7 years were related to an increased risk of
overweight at age 11 years only for girls, while there was no
association among boys (Models 2 and 3 in Table 3). As before,
additional adjustment for bedtimes and physical activity did not
substantially affect the results. For both genders, computer hours
at age 7 years were unrelated to overweight risk at age 11 years.
DISCUSSION
Our longitudinal analysis has shown that having a TV in the
bedroom is an independent risk factor for increased body fatness
in this nationally representative sample of UK children. After
extensive adjustment for a wide range of covariates, all three
measures of body fatness we assessed were associated with
having a TV in the child’s bedroom. Girls who had a TV in their
bedroom at age 7 years were at an approximately 30% higher risk
of being overweight at age 11 years compared with those who did

Television in the bedroom and body fatness

 not have a TV in their bedroom, and for boys the risk was
increased by about 20%. The effect size of this increased risk of
being overweight is comparable to the risks previously identified
for physical inactivity and not having been breastfed.40,47 The
number of hours spent watching TV or DVDs was associated with
increased body fatness among girls only, showing a dose–
response relationship. We found no independent association
between hours spent using a computer and body fatness for
either gender.
That associations between screen use and overweight/obesity
are stronger among girls than among boys has been suggested
previously13,48,49; however, the reasons for these findings remain
unclear. Research on the role of children’s computer use in the
development of overweight/obesity is still sparse and has
produced some conflicting findings.10,12,50 In our study, computer
use was unrelated to later body fatness, which is consistent with
the results of one meta-analysis that was, however, conducted
410 years ago.12 Further good-quality research is clearly needed.
Our results did not support the notion that screen use affects
body fatness via reduced sleep, although this finding should be
viewed with a degree of caution. Previous research has shown that
screen time affects sleep, and shorter sleep duration has been
linked to obesity.21–24 Children’s bedtime, the only measure of
sleep available to us, is only an approximation of sleep duration
and quality, which might have precluded us from finding evidence
for a role of sleep in the association between bedroom TVs and
body fatness. In relation to physical activity, the available
measures in the MCS are also relatively crude; however, our
results are consistent with the findings of three systematic reviews
which concluded that sedentary behaviors such as watching TV do
not necessarily displace physical activity.12,27,28
More than half of the 7-year-olds in our sample had a TV in their
bedroom. This finding is well in line with other recent UK reports
on children’s media use, which also suggest that children
increasingly use portable devices, such as tablets and laptops in
their bedrooms.2,3
This analysis has some limitations. First, our measures of
children’s screen time relied on parental reports. Parents are
likely to underestimate the hours children spend using a screen,
especially where the child has access to it in their own room. On
the other hand, the question whether the child has a TV in their
bedroom is straightforward and measurement error for this
variable is unlikely to be a concern. Second, owing to the very
limited availability of good quality dietary data in the MCS, we
were unable to explore whether diet patterns were on the
pathway between screen time and body fatness. It is important,
however, to acknowledge the strengths of our study. Our
longitudinal analysis was conducted on a nationally representative
large sample of children from across the United Kingdom, who
were followed over a 4-year time period from age 7 to age 11
years. We controlled for a wide range of covariates, including the
child’s BMI at age 3 years and maternal BMI, thus minimizing the
possibility of reverse causation and accounting for the influence of
genetic as well as environmental factors. We measured body
fatness using three different indicators: BMI, FMI, and overweight.
The inclusion of the FMI improves on previous research that relied
mainly on BMI, as FMI represents a more objective index of
adiposity that is independent of lean body mass.33,51 Having said
that, our findings were consistent across the three outcome
measures, and conclusions were very similar irrespective of
whether BMI or FMI was used to measure body fatness. Our data
therefore provide some evidence that studies using only BMI to
assess associations between screen use and body fatness can
produce equally informative results.
In conclusion, we have shown that having a TV in a child’s
bedroom is a significant independent risk factor for overweight
and increased body fatness in a nationally representative sample
of UK children. Although our analysis is not causal, our results
indicate that future childhood obesity prevention strategies
should consider access to TVs in children’s bedrooms as a risk
factor for obesity. Future research should investigate potential
pathways via sleep duration and diet, examine differences

and adolescents, as the use of screen-based media, including
computers, mobile phones and tablets, increases with age.
