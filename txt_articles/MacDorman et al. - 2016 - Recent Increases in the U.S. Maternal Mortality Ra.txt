Abstract
Background—A pregnancy question was added to the U.S. standard death certificate in 2003 to 
improve ascertainment of maternal deaths. The delayed adoption of this question among states led 
to data incompatibilities, and impeded accurate trend analysis. Our objectives were to develop 
methods for trend analysis, and to provide an overview of U.S. maternal mortality trends from 
2000–2014.
Methods—This observational study analyzed vital statistics maternal mortality data from all U.S. 
states in relation to the format and year-of-adoption of the pregnancy question. Correction factors 
were developed to adjust data from before the standard pregnancy question was adopted, to 
promote accurate trend analysis. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze trends for groups of 
states with similar pregnancy questions.
Results—The estimated maternal mortality rate (per 100,000 live births) for 48 states and 
Washington D.C. (excluding California and Texas, analyzed separately) increased by 26.6%, from 
18.8 in 2000 to 23.8 in 2014. California showed a declining trend, while Texas had a sudden 
increase in 2011–2012. Analysis of the measurement change suggests that U.S. rates in the early 
2000s were higher than previously reported.
Discussion—Despite the United Nations Millennium Development Goal for a 75% reduction in 
maternal mortality by 2015, the estimated maternal mortality rate for 48 states and Washington 
D.C. increased from 2000–2014, while the international trend was in the opposite direction. There 
is a need to redouble efforts to prevent maternal deaths and improve maternity care for the 4 
million U.S. women giving birth each year.

 Introduction
Maternal mortality is an important indicator of the quality of health care both nationally and 
internationally (1–3). The death of a mother during pregnancy, childbirth or post-partum is 
one of the greatest tragedies that can occur within a family, with wide-ranging consequences 
for the index child, other children, spouses, other family members, and the larger society (1–
5).
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) is the source of official United States’ maternal mortality statistics used for both 
sub-national and international comparisons (6). Studies based on data from the 1980s and 
1990s identified significant underreporting of maternal deaths in the National Vital Statistics 
System (7–8). To improve ascertainment, a pregnancy question was added to the 2003 
revision of the U.S. standard death certificate. The question has several checkboxes to 
ascertain whether female decedents were: Not pregnant within past year; pregnant at time of 
death; not pregnant, but pregnant within 42 days of death; not pregnant, but pregnant 43 
days to 1 year before death; or unknown if pregnant within the past year (9). The use of this 
pregnancy question has improved ascertainment of maternal deaths, and led to increases in 
reported maternal mortality rates (6).
However, there were delays in states’ adoption of the revised death certificate, and thus the 
new pregnancy question (6, 10, 11). In addition, some states had pregnancy questions that 
were inconsistent with the U.S. standard (6). This created a situation where, in any given 
data year, some states were using the U.S. standard question, others were using questions 
incompatible with the U.S. standard, and still others had no pregnancy question on their 
death certificates (6, 10, 11).
Due in part to the difficulties in disentangling these effects, the United States has not 
published an official maternal mortality rate since 2007 (11). This has led to a deficit of 
information both nationally and internationally, at a time when greater attention has been 
focused on maternal mortality than ever before (1–5, 12–13). For example, United Nations’ 
Millennium Development Goal 5a was to reduce the maternal mortality rate by 75% 
between 1990 and 2015 (12).
A supplemental data system, the Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System, collects data on 
pregnancy-related deaths (within 1 year of pregnancy), and has found recent increases in 
these deaths (14–15). However, since this system is based in large part on official vital 
statistics data (together with supplementary reports), these data could also have been 
influenced by the improved ascertainment of maternal deaths in the National Vital Statistics 
System. Thus, there is currently no clear picture of maternal mortality trends in the U.S. The 
aims of this study were to: 1) develop and test methods for trend analysis of vital statistics 
maternal mortality data from 2000–2014, taking into account state revision dates and 
different question formats; and 2) provide an overview of trends in U.S. maternal mortality 
rates from 2000–2014.

 Methods
The World Health Organization defines maternal death as: “The death of a woman while 
pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and the 
site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its 
management, but not from accidental or incidental causes” (16). This is the definition used 
for international maternal mortality comparisons. The WHO also provides a separate 
definition for late maternal deaths: “The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetric 
causes more than 42 days but less than one year after termination of pregnancy” (16).
United States maternal mortality data used for national and international comparisons are 
based on information reported on death certificates filed in state vital statistics offices, and 
subsequently compiled into national data through the National Vital Statistics System (10–
11). Physicians, medical examiners or coroners are responsible for completing the medical 
portion of the death certificate, including the cause of death. From 1999 to the present, 
cause-of-death data in the United States have been coded according to the International 
Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th Revision (ICD-10) 
(10–11). Maternal deaths are denoted by ICD-10 codes A34, O00–O95, O98–O99, while 
late maternal deaths are denoted by ICD-10 codes O96–O97 (6).
Maternal mortality data used in this study were derived from the detailed mortality data files 
publically available from NCHS, and also available through CDC-WONDER (17–18). 
Maternal mortality rates were computed per 100,000 live births. Joinpoint regression 
analysis was used to model trends over time (19). This approach is also commonly referred 
to as piecewise or segmented regression and has been implemented to test for differences in 
adjacent time trends using permutation tests and assessing overall model fit using the 
Bayesian Information Criterion (19). Because the study was based on de-identified, 
aggregated data from U.S. government public-use data sets, the study was exempt from 
requiring institutional review board approval.
State maternal mortality reporting
The timing of states adopting the revised death certificate, including the pregnancy question, 
is shown in table 1. For the purposes of this paper, revised refers to states that have adopted 
the 2003 revision of the U.S. standard death certificate, while unrevised refers to states that 
have not yet adopted the 2003 revision and thus are using the older (1989) version of the 
death certificate. Before revision, 18 states had a pregnancy question on their death 
certificate; however for only 3 of these states (Alabama, Maryland, and New Mexico) did the 
question collect data on pregnancy within the 42-day standard timeframe. The other 15 
states had pregnancy questions with time frames ranging from 3 to 18 months after 
pregnancy. Thirty-two states and Washington D.C. did not have a pregnancy question on 
their unrevised death certificate.
Only 4 states (California, Idaho, Montana, and New York) revised their death certificates in 
2003, the year that the death certificate revision was intended to take place. A few states 
continued to revise each year, until 44 states and Washington D.C. (all except Alabama, 
Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, Virginia and West Virginia) had revised by January 1,

 2014 (Massachusetts and Virginia both revised late in 2014). All states that revised their 
death certificates now had a pregnancy question comparable with the U.S. standard, except 
for California, which adopted a pregnancy question asking only about pregnancies within the 
past year. Thus, as of January 1 2014, all states except California, Colorado, Massachusetts, 
Virginia, and West Virginia were supplying pregnancy data for the standard 42-day 
timeframe.
Development of correction factors
It would be preferable to analyze data individually for each state, however, maternal death is 
a rare event, and the numbers of cases (396 U.S. deaths in 2000, and 856 in 2014) were not 
sufficient to support individual state analysis for all but the most populous states (California 
and Texas). Rather, states needed to be grouped by some mechanism to create groups large 
enough for analysis. However, states varied widely in revision dates and unrevised question 
formats. Therefore we developed a correction procedure to combine data from states with 
similar characteristics that revised their death certificates in different data years.
The correction factor was developed to adjust unrevised data to be comparable to revised 
data, and was computed for a group of 24 states and Washington D.C. that, before revision, 
did not have a pregnancy question (Analysis Group 1 – see Table 1).
For states that revised in the middle of the year, data from their revision year was dropped, 
and data from the two following and two preceding years were used in the computation. 
Data for states that revised in 2014 were excluded from these computations, as these states 
did not yet have two years of data after the revision to contribute. This correction factor was 
multiplied by the number of unrevised deaths for each state prior to the revision to estimate 
the number of maternal deaths in the unrevised years. Adjusted numbers of deaths were then 
used to compute maternal mortality rates for the combined 24 states and Washington D.C.
This same methodology was used to develop a correction factor for a group of 14 states 
(including Texas, analyzed separately) that had a non-standard pregnancy question with a 
timeframe longer than the 42 day standard (Analysis Group 2 – see Table 1) prior to 
revision.
Unadjusted analysis
Analysis Groups 3 and 4 include 11 states whose data were analyzed as reported, without 
recourse to correction factors. Group 3 includes 8 states that had not revised as of late 2013 
and either did not have a pregnancy question on their unrevised death certificate (Alaska, 
Colorado, Hawaii, North Carolina, Massachusetts, West Virginia, and Wisconsin) or had a 
pregnancy question with a longer timeframe (Virginia). Wisconsin revised in September 
2013 and was excluded from the 2013 data point. Group 4 includes 3 states (Alabama, 
MacDorman et al.

 Maryland and New Mexico) that had an unrevised pregnancy question asking about deaths 
during or within 42 days after pregnancy.
California analysis
California is the only state that revised their death certificate with a pregnancy question 
inconsistent with the U.S. standard. The California question only asks about pregnancies 
within the past year. In addition, there were changes over time in specific data provided by 
California to NCHS for deaths at <42 days, making use of this measure impracticable (6, 
20). Thus, maternal and late maternal deaths were combined for the California trend 
analysis.
Computing estimated maternal mortality rates for 48 states and DC
Finally, we estimated maternal mortality rates for 48 states and D.C. from 2000–2014. 
California and Texas were excluded from this estimation: California because it does not 
provide comparable data, and Texas due to uncertainty regarding recent trends (see Results 
section).
First, we computed a weighted average of the slope of the regression lines from Analysis 
Groups 1–4. The slopes of the four regression lines were weighted by the total number of 
live births from 2000–2014 that were included in the maternal mortality rate computations. 
Then we computed a combined, reported 2014 maternal mortality rate for states that had a 
pregnancy question comparable to the US standard in 2014. We applied the average slope to 
this rate to back-estimate maternal mortality rates back to 2000. This exercise yielded 
estimated maternal mortality rates for the 48 states and DC for the period 2000–2014.
Results
Simply totaling the raw, unadjusted data from all states regardless of whether or not they 
revised their death certificates results in a reported U.S. maternal mortality rate that more 
than doubled from 9.8 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 2000 to 21.5 in 2014 (17). 
However, the adjusted maternal mortality rate increased more slowly for a group of 24 states 
and Washington D.C. (Analysis Group 1 – see Table 1) that only included a pregnancy 
question after they revised their death certificates (Figure 1). The correction factor for Group 
1 states was 1.932 (483 maternal deaths in the two years after revision/250 maternal deaths 
in the two years prior to revision). The modeled adjusted maternal mortality rate for Group 1 
states, which adjusts for presumed undercounting in the years prior to revision, increased 
from 18.2 in 2000 to 22.8 in 2014. The slope of the regression line was 0.33 (95% CI 0.07, 
0.58), and was based on 3,108 maternal deaths and 19,328,481 live births from 2000–2014.
Group 2 included states that had a non-standard pregnancy question prior to revision, and 
revised to the U.S. standard. The correction factor for these states was 2.067 (676/327 
maternal deaths). Among these states, the adjusted maternal mortality rate was higher than 
reported in 2000 (18.4) and rose to 24.5 in 2014. The slope of the regression line was 0.44 
(95% CI 0.05–0.82) (based on 3,098 maternal deaths and 18,136,263 births) (Figure 2).

 Data for Analysis Groups 3 (8 states) and 4 (3 states) are analyzed without adjustment and 
are shown in Figure 3. For Group 3, states that did not revise and did not have a comparable 
question pre-revision, the rates reported are uniformly lower than for other states and the 
modeled maternal mortality rate was 8.0 in 2000 and increased to 10.4 in 2013. The slope of 
the regression line was 0.19 (95% CI −0.02, 0.39) (638 maternal deaths and 6,804,191 live 
births). For Analysis Group 4, states that already had a comparable pregnancy question on 
their death certificate throughout the study period, the modeled maternal mortality rate rose 
from 14.0 in 2000 to 19.9 in 2014. The slope of the regression line was 0.42 (95% CI 0.09, 
0.75), (425 maternal deaths and 2,453,198 live births).
California and Texas were analyzed separately as they had trends that were markedly 
different from other U.S. states, and sufficient numbers of maternal deaths for reliable trend 
analysis. Texas had an unrevised question about pregnancies in the past 12 months, and 
revised to the U.S. standard question in 2006. Adjusted maternal mortality rates for Texas 
show only a modest increase from 2000–2010, from a rate of 17.7 in 2000 to 18.6 in 2010. 
The slope of this regression line was 0.12 (95% CI −0.22, 0.46), (564 maternal deaths and 
4,246,835 live births) (Figure 4). However, after 2010, the reported maternal mortality rate 
for Texas doubled within a two year period to levels not seen in other U.S. states. Joinpoint 
trend analysis was done separately for the 2000–2010 and the 2011–2014 periods as the 
trends for these two periods differed widely.
California data are shown in Figure 5 for maternal and late maternal deaths combined (those 
occurring within 1 year of pregnancy). The California rate was markedly lower in 2000–
2002, before the pregnancy question was adopted, and the reported rate nearly doubled once 
the pregnancy question (asking about pregnancies <1 year) was introduced in 2003. As the 
2000–2002 data were clearly not comparable, joinpoint regression analysis was done for the 
2003–2014 data. The modeled maternal mortality rates decreased from 21.5 in 2003 to 15.1 
in 2014. The slope of the line was −0.58 (95% CI −1.05, −0.11), or 0.58 unit of decrease in 
the combined maternal and late maternal mortality rate per year (based on 1,190 maternal 
deaths and 6,356,032 live births).
Finally, we provide estimated maternal mortality rates for 48 states and DC from 2000–2014 
(Table 2). For the 48 states and D.C. (excluding California and Texas), the estimated 
maternal mortality rate in 2000 was 18.8, and the rate increased slowly to a rate of 23.8 in 
2014, an increase of 26.6% (Table 2). The slope of the regression line was 0.36 (95% CI 
0.05, 0.67), based on 7,269 reported maternal deaths and 46,722,133 live births from 2000–
2014. Since the reported (unadjusted) maternal mortality rate for the 48 states and DC 
increased by 132.3% from 2000–2014 (from 9.9 to 23.0) (17), we estimate that 20.1% 
(26.6%/132.3%) of the observed increase in the maternal mortality rate from 2000–2014 was 
due to a real increase in maternal mortality, and 79.9% was due to improved ascertainment.
Sensitivity Analysis
Since the results of the modeling for Groups 1 and 2 could vary depending on the magnitude 
of the correction factors, we did a sensitivity analysis to assess the degree to which these 
factors might differ under differing conditions. For Groups 1 and 2 separately, we computed 
correction factors using 1 year, 2 year, and 3 year intervals in both the numerator and 
MacDorman et al.

 denominator. Computing the 3-year correction factor involved dropping data for 1 state 
(Louisiana) that did not have 3 years of revised data to contribute. Within group 2, we 
computed correction factors separately for Texas and for all other states. We also computed 
separate correction factors for states with a pregnancy question with a timeframe of < 6 
months, compared to states with a timeframe of 6 months or greater. Since all of the 
resulting values were within 6% of the correction factors used in the study, and since the use 
of the 3-year correction factor would have involved dropping data from Louisiana, the 2-year 
correction factors were retained in the final study.
Discussion
Despite the United Nations Millennium Development Goal for a 75% reduction in maternal 
mortality from 1990–2015 the reported (unadjusted) U.S. maternal mortality rate more than 
doubled from 2000–2014. As we’ve shown, most of the reported increase in maternal 
mortality rates from 2000–2014 was due to improved ascertainment of maternal deaths. 
However, combined data for 48 states and DC showed an increase in the estimated maternal 
mortality rate from 18.8 in 2000 to 23.8 in 2014 - a 26.6% increase. Notably, the smaller 
increase seen in the adjusted data appears to be a result of earlier estimates of the U.S. 
national rate being substantially underreported. Clearly at a time when WHO reports that 
157 of 183 countries studied had decreases in maternal mortality between 2000 and 2013 
(21), the U.S. maternal mortality rate is moving in the wrong direction. Among 31 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries reporting 
maternal mortality data, the U.S. would rank 30th, ahead of only Mexico (22).
California, however, showed a marked decline in maternal and late maternal mortality from 
2003–2014. California has made concerted efforts to reduce maternal mortality, including 
initiating a statewide pregnancy-associated mortality review in 2006, and contracting with 
the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative to investigate primary causes of maternal 
death. This collaborative developed and promulgated evidence-based tool kits to address two 
of the most common, preventable contributors to maternal death (obstetric hemorrhage and 
preeclampsia), and implemented quality improvement initiatives throughout the state (23–
25). These efforts appear to have helped reduce maternal mortality in California (23).
The Texas data are puzzling in that they show a modest increase in maternal mortality from 
2000–2010 (slope=0.12) followed by a doubling within a 2-year period in the reported 
maternal mortality rate. In 2006, Texas revised its death certificate, including the addition of 
the U.S. standard pregnancy question, and also implemented an electronic death certificate. 
However, the 2006 changes did not appreciably affect the maternal mortality trend after 
adjustment, and the doubling in the rate occurred in 2011–2012. Texas cause-of-death data, 
as with data for most states, are coded at NCHS, and this doubling in the rate was not found 
for other states. Communications with vital statistics personnel in Texas and at NCHS did 
not identify any data processing or coding changes that would account for this rapid 
increase. There were some changes in the provision of women’s health services in Texas 
from 2011–2015, including the closing of several women’s health clinics (26–27). Still, in 
the absence of war, natural disaster, or severe economic upheaval, the doubling of a 
mortality rate within a 2-year period in a state with almost 400,000 annual births seems

 unlikely. A future paper will examine Texas data by race/ethnicity and detailed causes of 
death to better understand this unusual finding.
The larger correction factor for Group 2 than for Group 1 states is not surprising when 
examined in the context of NCHS coding rules. These rules code pregnancy data for states 
with a pregnancy question with a timeframe longer than the 42 day standard to late maternal 
death (O96–97) codes, which are by definition excluded from standard maternal mortality 
calculations (6). This decision is understandable as the more conservative approach, since 
the exact timing of death was unknown. However, it has caused significant disruption in 
trend analysis of maternal and late maternal mortality rates. This is because most maternal 
deaths within 1 year of pregnancy actually occur during or very soon after pregnancy. For 
example, in 2009 (about the mid-point in the adoption of the revised certificate) 64% of 
maternal deaths <1 year were coded to the late maternal (O96–O97) category for the 8 
unrevised states that had a pregnancy question with a timeframe longer than the 42-day 
standard, compared to just 21% for the 30 revised states that had adopted the U.S. standard 
pregnancy question.
The strengths of the study include the use of vital statistics data that provide information on 
all births and deaths in the United States during the study period. The limitations of the 
study are also those of vital statistics, and include concerns about the accuracy of cause-of-
death information provided by the physician, medical examiner or coroner (7, 28). The 
prompt nature of vital statistics registration also means that such registration may initially 
occur based on an interim cause of death, which, depending on the efficiency of state 
systems, may or may not be updated after cause-of-death investigations are completed (29). 
Evaluation of the accuracy of reporting of the pregnancy question is important as this 
information is used in conjunction with the reported causes of death to classify maternal 
deaths (28). However, the pregnancy data are currently not included on public-use data sets 
(17–18), so such evaluations are infeasible for non-NCHS researchers. During the time 
period under study, states have increasingly moved towards electronic death registration, and 
away from paper-based death certificates. NCHS has continued to provide training in cause-
of-death certification to state vital statistics personnel and has recently taken on a greater 
role in coding cause-of-death data. However these changes are unlikely to have substantially 
influenced maternal mortality reporting (20).
It is an international embarrassment that the United States, since 2007, has not been able to 
provide a national maternal mortality rate to international data repositories such as those run 
by the OECD (22). This inability reflects the chronic underfunding over the past two 
decades of state and national vital statistics systems. Indeed, it was primarily a lack of funds 
that led to delays (of more than a decade in many states) in the adoption of the 2003 revised 
birth and death certificates. And this delay created the complex data comparability problem 
addressed in this study. The lack of publication of U.S. maternal mortality data since 2007 
has also meant that these data have received a lesser degree of scrutiny and quality control, 
when compared to published vital statistics measures such as infant mortality. For example, 
had NCHS and the Texas vital statistics office both been publishing annual maternal 
mortality rates, the unusual findings from Texas for 2011–2014 would certainly have been 
investigated much sooner and in greater detail. Accurate measurement of maternal mortality

 is an essential first step in prevention efforts, as it can identify at-risk populations and 
measure the progress of prevention programs.
In conclusion, the maternal mortality rate for 48 states and Washington D.C. from 2000–
2014 was higher than previously reported, is increasing, and places the U.S. far behind other 
industrialized nations. There is a need to redouble efforts to prevent maternal deaths and 
improve maternity care for the 4 million U.S. women giving birth each year.
