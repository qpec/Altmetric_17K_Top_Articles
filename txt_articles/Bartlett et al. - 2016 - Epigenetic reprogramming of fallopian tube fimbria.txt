The exact timing and contribution of epigenetic reprogramming to carcinogenesis are unclear.
Women harbouring BRCA1/2 mutations demonstrate a 30–40-fold increased risk of
high-grade serous extra-uterine Mu
¨llerian cancers (HGSEMC), otherwise referred to as
‘ovarian carcinomas’, which frequently develop from fimbrial cells but not from the proximal
portion of the fallopian tube. Here we compare the DNA methylome of the fimbrial and
proximal ends of the fallopian tube in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and non-carriers. We show
that the number of CpGs displaying significant differences in methylation levels between
fimbrial and proximal fallopian tube segments are threefold higher in BRCA mutation carriers
than in controls, correlating with overexpression of activation-induced deaminase in their
fimbrial epithelium. The differentially methylated CpGs accurately discriminate HGSEMCs
from non-serous subtypes. Epigenetic reprogramming is an early pre-malignant event integral
to BRCA1/2 mutation-driven carcinogenesis. Our findings may provide a basis for
cancer-preventative strategies.

 T
he development of non-invasive primary cancer preventive
measures in humans requires a thorough understanding of
the initial cancer-driving molecular mechanisms. High-
grade
serous
extra-uterine
Mu
¨llerian
cancers
(HGSEMC)
(formerly classified as ovarian/tubal/peritoneal) present at late
stage and are associated with o40% 5-year survival. Although the
recent TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) initiatives1 revealed
key molecular changes in established cancers, very little is known
about the initial molecular alterations in HGSEMC development.
Analyses of tissues carrying an increased risk before the
development
of
any
microscopic
alteration
are
lacking.
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers have up to a 30–40-fold increased
risk
of
developing
reproductive
cancers2–5,
predominantly
HGSEMC6 and breast cancer. Despite a plethora of evidence
linking mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 to cancer development7
the core components, such as organ specificity (that is, to breast
and fallopian tube), are still poorly understood. The fallopian tube
of BRCA mutation carriers offers a unique opportunity to study
HGSEMC development because these cancers originate only from
the distal (that is, fimbrial) end of the fallopian tube (close to the
ovary), and not from the proximal end (close to the uterus)8–10.
The ovary, being in close proximity to the fimbriae, is usually
infiltrated early by invasive fimbrial cancers, accounting for their
frequent classification as ovarian carcinomas.
Current evidence supporting the notion that epigenetic
reprogramming is a crucial step in cancer development11 is
largely based on artificial model systems12 or on association
studies in established cancers13. Specifically, enhancer and
repressed regions marked in each cell type with histone 3 lysine
4
monomethylation
(H3K4me1)
and
histone
3
lysine
27
trimethylation
(H3K27me3),
respectively,
are
subject
to
reprogramming at the level of histone marks and the DNA
methylome11,14.
Here we describe an epigenetic reprogramming phenomenon
occurring specifically in the proximal end of the fallopian tube in
BRCA mutation carriers, which is not evident in matched
controls.
Furthermore,
we
show
that
this
epigenetic
reprogramming event is driven by aberrantly high AID (activa-
tion-induced cytosine deaminase) expression and is an integral
early pre-malignant event in HGSEMC development. Our
findings provide the basis for the development of primary
ovarian cancer prevention strategies in BRCA1/2 mutation
carriers.
Results
DNA methylation in fimbrial and proximal fallopian tube.
We performed
epigenome-wide
DNA
methylation
(DNAme)
analyses (using the Illumina 450k DNA methylation bead-array assay
assessing DNAme at B480,000 CpG sites) in 215 microscopic foci of
normal fallopian tubes from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (n¼ 56) and
controls (n¼ 59) who had their tubes/ovaries removed for risk-
reduction or other reasons, respectively. We analysed both the
fimbrial (at elevated risk) and the proximal (at average risk) portions
of the tubes separately (Fig. 1a) in 52 carriers and 49 controls in order
to adjust for epigenetic effects of no immediate importance to the
carcinogenic process. Whereas only 37,991 CpGs demonstrated
significant differences between the fimbrial and proximal segments in
controls, 106,723 CpGs demonstrated significant differences between
these two sites in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (Fig. 1b). Of those
CpGs demonstrating 40.03 median b value difference between
the fimbrial compared with the proximal segments, 81 and 19%
were hypo- and hypermethylated, respectively (Fig. 1a,b and
Supplementary Data 1 and 2). These figures remained unchanged
irrespective of whether the mutation was in BRCA1 or BRCA2
(Supplementary Figs 1 and 2).

 polycomb repressor complex 2, PRC2) or marked by H3K27me3.
Unexpectedly, genes that are significantly hypomethylated in the
fimbrial versus proximal segments in mutation carriers (but not
in controls) are also enriched for PRC2 targets, including
H3K27me3-marked sites (Supplementary Data 4). We applied
the eFORGE tool (http://eforge.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) to explore whether
there are specific regions prone to preferential epigenetic
reprogramming within the fimbrial tissue of BRCA1/2 carriers
to document tissue-specific patterns of histone modification.
Hypomethylated regions were shown to be enriched for highly
tissue-specific H3K4me1 marks, whereas regions containing the
repressive H3K27me3 mark were enriched preferentially for
undifferentiated and fetal states as indicated by the particularly
low average q-values (that is, p-values corrected for false
discovery rate (FDR)) in stem cells and fetal tissues (Fig. 2). A
similar pattern was observed for hypermethylated regions
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
HOXC4 methylation and expression. CpGs showing the largest
methylation difference between fimbrial and proximal compart-
ments in mutation carriers belonged to the HOXC4 gene (Fig. 1a).
Whereas the majority of the 44 HOXC4 CpGs represented on the
Illumina 450K array demonstrated little difference between these
2 compartments, those in the promoter region, including
oestrogen responsive elements and NF-kB binding sites, revealed
large differences owing to increased methylation levels in the
proximal (compared with the fimbrial) compartment in mutation
carriers (Fig. 3). This is expected of a polycomb repressor
complex 2 target gene like HOXC4 and agrees with previous
data18,19.

HOXC4-mediated AID expression. HOXC4 is a key trigger
for expression of AID20,21. This enzyme plays an important
role in antibody class switch DNA recombination, somatic

elements from either data source for each cell sample separately (ENCODE and Roadmap), and the number of overlaps is counted. A background
distribution of the expected overlap counts for this DMP set is obtained by picking sets of the same number of DMPs as the test DMP set, matched for
gene relationship and CpG island relationship annotation. The matched background sets are then overlapped with the functional elements and the
background distribution of overlaps determined. By default 1,000 matched sets are used. The enrichment value for the test DMP set is plotted as the

 risk factors for HGSEMCs (that is, pelvic inflammatory disease or
frequent ovulation associated with the need for repeated repair of
ovulatory defects in close proximity to the fimbrial tube) and (ii)
be more abundant in women with a family history due to a
BRCA1 mutation27–29, lead to increased expression of AID
(Fig. 4b). Reduction of HOXC4 levels (Supplementary Fig. 5)
substantially reduced the AID-inducing effect of TNF-a and
IL1-b (Fig. 4b). Consistent with HOXC4 (ref. 30) and AID23
function, HOXC4 increases the fraction of side population (stem
and progenitor) cells (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Fig. 6). AID
overexpression
(Supplementary
Fig.
7)
enhances
HOXC4
expression (Fig. 4d). Whereas AID expression was almost
absent in the proximal fallopian tube, it was expressed at low
levels in the fimbriae of control women but at high levels in
fimbriae from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers consistent with our
in vitro data (Fig. 4e,f).
Role of AID in fimbrial epithelium. Forced-expression of AID
led to a consistent increase in side population cells in agreement
with AID’s role in stem cell biology (Fig. 4g and Supplementary
Fig. 8). Overexpression of AID in primary cultures derived from
fimbrial cells triggered a substantial epigenetic reprogramming
(Fig. 5a). As expected, a high number of CpGs (n ¼ 28,626)
showed reduced methylation levels (40.3 b difference of
AID-overexpressing cells compared with empty vector controls,
Supplementary Data 5). A smaller number of CpGs (n ¼ 16,134)
showed an increase in DNA methylation (40.3 b difference,
Supplementary Data 6). This was confirmed—albeit to a smaller
extent—in other cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 9). We observed a
significant overlap between CpGs affected by AID in cultured
fimbrial cells and those that are differentially methylated in
fimbrial compared with proximal fallopian tube compartments in
mutation carriers (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. 10). It is
particularly notable that regions marked with H3K4me1 or
H3K27me in stem cells and fetal tissues are those with the highest
enrichment score for overlap with regions hypomethylated
(Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 11) and hypermethylated upon
AID overexpression (Supplementary Fig. 12). Remarkably, the
adult tissue signature
most
enriched within
the in vitro
AID-induced
epigenetic
reprogramming model
of cultured
fimbrial cells was the ovary, exactly as seen in the in vivo BRCA
fimbrial-proximal model (Fig. 2).
Link between reprogramming and cancer. The data presented
thus far are consistent with the view that AID induces epigenetic
reprogramming resulting in a decreased state of cellular differ-
entiation in the fimbriae of BRCA mutation carriers.
To further substantiate the idea that reprogrammed CpG sites
in histologically normal fimbriae of BRCA mutation carriers are
relevant to cancer development and biology, we hypothesized that
the same CpGs should be enriched amongst those differentially
methylated between HGSEMCs (by far most prevalent histolo-
gical subtype of ovarian cancer in mutation carriers) and the
other extra-uterine Mu
¨llerian cancer subtypes. The 5,000 CpGs
(that is, approximately the top 1% available on the array) with
greatest increase or decrease in methylation level between BRCA
mutation carriers and controls in the fimbrial compartment
(Fig. 6a) overlapped very significantly with corresponding
HGSEMC-specific CpGs (Fig. 6b). The finding of a highly
significant overlap between CpGs that are modulated by AID
expression in primary fimbrial cells and those discriminating
HGSEMCs from non-serous subtypes (Fig. 6c and Supplementary
Fig. 13) further attests to AID’s key role in triggering epigenetic
reprogramming in tissues at increased risk of HGSEMC in BRCA
mutation carriers. CpGs whose methylation levels increase or
decrease in the fimbriae in BRCA mutation carriers compared
with controls strongly overlap with those regulated by AID in cell
lines (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Fig. 14). The results are very

the earliest stages of cancer development in BRCA mutation
carriers.
Discussion
During the past decade, clear evidence has accumulated that
epigenetic programming determines cell fate and that these
programs at all levels of the epigenome—including DNA
methylation—are dramatically different in established cancers
compared with the tissues from which they originate11,31.
Naturally in humans it is almost impossible to assess when
epigenetic reprogramming is initiated in the progression towards
cancer development. Studying this phenomenon is complicated
further by the fact that epigenetic reprogramming is (i) tissue-
specific and (ii) subject to alteration by age and various
environmental exposures. The human fallopian tube is one of
the very few human organs which allow the study of true pre-
neoplastic reprogramming events because B40% of BRCA
mutation carriers are eventually diagnosed with a HGSEMC
originating in the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, providing an
opportunity to examine tissues at elevated cancer risk before
morphological evidence of neoplastic transformation. In addition,
epigenetic background noise triggered by factors unrelated to
cancer development can be adjusted for by analysing the
proximal end of the fallopian tube, which is not associated with
increased cancer risk. Both our descriptive and functional data
demonstrate that AID-mediated reprogramming is a prevalent
and early phenomenon in the fimbriae of BRCA mutation
carriers.
This
epigenetic
reprogramming
largely
resets
tissue-specific programs seen in fetal and undifferentiated
(stem) cells. Importantly, the observation that these alterations
are preserved in high-grade serous compared with non-serous
cancers, which do not originate in the fallopian tube, adds further
evidence to the functional importance of early epigenetic
reprogramming.
BRCA1/2 germline mutation carriers have an elevated cancer
risk restricted to breast and reproductive organs in spite of the
fact that the encoded proteins are expressed in nearly every tissue.
Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 have important roles in chromosome
duplication, maintenance, and segregation across the cell cycle
and are regarded as the ‘chromosome custodians’7. Hence if this
cell-autonomous
effect
was
the
only
driver
of
neoplastic
transformation in BRCA mutation carriers, organs with both a
high cell number and cell turnover should be most susceptible to
cancerous transformation. The fact that BRCA mutation carriers
do not have an elevated risk of cancer in organs with high cell
turnover, for example the colon or the bone marrow, underscores
the importance of understanding systemic cell-non-autonomous
mechanisms in triggering early events, including epigenetic
events, in BRCA-driven cancer development.
The fact that constitutive and ubiquitous expression of AID in
transgenic mice leads to cancer development very early on in
various organs32,33 leading to early death33 supports the idea of
AID being an essential component of carcinogenesis. Currently
we can only speculate as to why AID is overexpressed in BRCA1/2
mutation carriers. In the setting of gastric cancer, exogenous
factors like Helicobacter pylori trigger an aberrant expression of
AID in gastric cells which leads to an accumulation of nucleotide
alterations in the TP53 tumour suppressor gene26 and therefore
highlights the relevance of cell-‘non-autonomous’ factors in
driving AID expression. In the BRCA mutation carrier setting,
cell ‘non-autonomous’ factors such as aberrant levels and/or
dynamics of cytokines released from the ovary during the repair
of the ovarian surface after each monthly ovulation, which affect
the fimbriae in a paracrine fashion, or a higher rate of ascending
infections,
may
drive
cancer
predisposing
aberrant
AID
expression. Alternatively, cell ‘non-autonomous’ factors known
to be strongly associated with HGSEMC risk (that is, high
number of ovulations and pelvic inflammatory disease34) could
lead to aberrantly high AID. Some, although rather preliminary,
support for a cell ‘non-autonomous’ mechanism comes from the
observation that a BRCA1 mutation enhances Interleukin-1b
expression in ovarian surface epithelial cells29, and that BRCA
mutation carriers’ associated epigenetic mis-programming of
immune cells18 may lead to subtle immune defects which in turn
facilitate microbial ascension from the vagina to the fallopian
tube. Additional evidence for a cell ‘non-autonomous’ factor
comes from our previous observation that BRCA mutation
carriers demonstrate higher oestrogen levels in the luteal phase35.
As indicated above, after ovulation during the luteal phase, there
is high inflammatory activity in close proximity to the fimbriae,
and estrogen—via activation of HOXC4—might further increase
AID expression in BRCA carriers during this stage of the
menstrual
cycle.
Eventually,
AID-mediated
reprogramming
events could then accumulate at the fimbriae.

 In summary, we demonstrated that epigenetic reprogramming
in morphologically normal fimbrial cells of BRCA1/2 mutation
carriers, which have a high risk for neoplastic transformation, is
highly prevalent and mediated by AID, and that the changes in
methylation are maintained in HGSEMCs. These findings open
entirely new windows of opportunities to develop novel strategies
for non-invasive cancer-preventive measures.
Methods
Patient cohort description. Based on our previous study where we analysed blood
cells of 72 BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and 72 controls18, we estimated that 50–60
mutation carriers and controls should provide sufficient power to detect
methylation differences (between fimbrial at elevated cancer risk and proximal
at average cancer risk fallopian tubes) between carriers and controls. The study and
the use of archived samples has been approved by the UCL/University College
London Hospitals (UCLH) Biobank for Studying Health and Disease Ethical
Review Committee under REC 10/H1306/42 (EC08.12: Retrospective study of
fallopian tubes and ovaries from women with BRCA1/2 mutations) did not require
informed consent.
After removing samples in our quality control procedure, we analysed DNAme
data from 59 controls, 30 BRCA1 mutation carriers and 26 BRCA2 mutation
carriers. Of the controls and the mutation carriers, 49 and 52, respectively, had data
available for both fimbrial and proximal ends of the fallopian tube. The median age
of controls was 50 years (range 15 to 81), the median age of BRCA1 mutation
carriers was 46.5 years (range 36–66), and the median age of BRCA2 mutation
carriers was 50.5 years (range 40–65). There was no significant age difference
between BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and controls (p ¼ 0.66, Wilcox-test). The
controls had an operation due to one of the following conditions: fibroids (n ¼ 20),
adenomyosis (n ¼ 10), cervical pathology (n ¼ 4), uterine prolapse (n ¼ 4), polyps
(n ¼ 4) and other (n ¼ 17).
We also analysed cancer samples of various histological subtypes37: (i) 124
high-grade serous samples, of which 115 were stages 3–4 (median age was 58 years,
range 36–84) and 36 other cancer subtypes, of which (ii) 17 were endometrioid,
(iii) 13 were clear cell and (iv) six were mucinous. Out of the 36 non-serous
subtypes, 19 were stages 3–4. Median age of these 36 patients with other histologies
was 56.5 years (range 29–85).
DNA extraction and DNA methylation analyses. Formalin fixed paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks were retrieved from UCL Biobank (NC09.13).
Histopathological features of fimbrial and proximal compartment of fallopian tube
from BRCA carriers and controls were carefully examined. Samples negative for
serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma lesions were chosen for DNA isolation to
characterize pre-cancerous epigenetic changes. For DNA isolation, a core of
3 � 0.6 mm was taken from each block representing fimbrial and proximal end of
fallopian tubes from both BRCA carriers and matched controls. The DNA was
isolated using QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit as per manufacturer’s protocol with
minor modifications (Dewaxing for 4 h in xylene and proteinase digestion per-
formed overnight, other procedures were as per the instructions). DNA from cell
lines (untreated, vector control and AID-overexpressing cells) was isolated using
AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturers instruction. DNA was
quantified using Nandrop and restored using the Infinium FFPE DNA Restore Kit
and then 200 ng of DNA was bisulfite converted using the EZ DNA Methylation-
Gold and subjected to methylation analysis on the Illumina Infinium Human
Methylation450 BeadChip.
For cancer samples we used frozen tissue. DNA was isolated from tissue
samples using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen Ltd, UK, 69506)
and 600 ng was bisulfite converted using the Zymo methylation Kits (Zymo
Research Inc, USA, D5004/8). Genome wide methylation analysis was performed
using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation450 BeadChip. Fallopian tube data
are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number
GSE74845 and ovarian cancer data are available under accession number
GSE72021.
Cell culture. Established cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and HOC7 from ATCC
#HTB77 and from Ronald Buick at University of Toronto38, respectively). The cells
were maintained in DMEM/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were seeded into six-well
tissue culture plates for cytokine (TNFa and IL1B) treatment or lentivirus
infection. The cell lines tested negative for mycoplasma contamination.
Primary fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell culture. Patients undergoing
salpingectomy with hysterectomy for endometrial cancer or reasons other than
serous cancer at UCLH were consented to donate fallopian tube tissue surplus to
diagnostic requirements (that is, not needed for clinical care) following UCL ethical
guidelines (women provided written informed consents and samples were collected
under the NRES Committee London—Surrey Borders Research Ethics Committee
approval; 14/LO/1633). Fimbrial fallopian tube secretory epithelial cells were
isolated and cultured as described by Karst and Drapkin39. Briefly, fimbrial tissues
were carefullly disected out by an experienced pathologist, macerated and digested

 in a dissociation medium (0.14% pronase and 0.01% DNase in MEM) for 36 h at
4 �C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and incubated at 37 �C on collagen
coated six-well (35 mm) tissue culture plates in DMEM/F-12 supplimented with
2% Ultroser G (Pall corporation, France) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
Adherent cells atB50% confluence were immortalized by infection with retroviral
constructs for hTERT stable expression. Cells were phenotyped: firstly by
determining mRNA expression of PAX8 (Mullerian marker) and Cytokeratin 7
(CK7, epithelial marker) using quantitative PCR; and secondly by
immunofluorescent staining. Cells were seeded into 35 mm tissue culture plates for
subsequent experiments. All experiments were carried out before cells started to
senesce. Cell senescence was a major hurdle for long-term incubation studies, but
primary fimbrial cells offer the advantage of mimicking biological events close to
ovarian cancer studies.
Stable cell lines. 293T cells were cultured into T-75 tissue culture flasks for 1 day
before transfection. Complexes of packaging plasmid (7.5 mg, pCMV-dR8.2 dvp or
p8.91), envelope plasmid (2.5 mg pCMV-VSV-G or pMD.2G) and construct (10 mg;
as shown in Supplementary Table 1) were prepared using lipofectamine 2000 (Life
technologies) as per manufacturer’s instructions (third Generation Lenti-Combo
Packing Mix was used for lentivirual production when constructs from). 293T cells
at 70% confluence were transfected with complexes prepared as described above.
The culture medium was changed 24 h post transfection and virus was harvested at
48 and 72 h post transfection. Virus was concentrated using Lenti-X concentrator
(Clonetech) as per manufacturers instructions. Cells (HOC7, SKOV3 and primary
fimbrial cells) were cultured into 35 mm well plates and infected with lentiviral
constructs in presence of polybrene (1 mg ml � 1) (for HOXC4 or AID over-
expression, shRNA against HOXC4 or corresponding empty vector) or retroviral
constructs (hTERT overexpression). Cells stably carrying virus-mediated gene
integration were selected by treating with puromycin (1 mg ml � 1) and maintained
in puromycin medium at least for a week or until all the untreated control cells
were dead. Selective overexpression or suppression of genes of interest was
measured by real-time PCR. For HOXC4 knockdown experiments, different
constructs were screened, and the construct showing maximum gene knockdown
efficiency was used for cytokine treatment experiments.
RNA isolation and gene expression analysis. Total RNA was isolated using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) as per manufacturer’s recommendation. RNA was
eluted in water and quantified by ultraviolet absorbance measurements with a
nanodrop instrument. One microgram of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis
using High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) in a
volume of 20 ml as per manufacturer’s instructions. Gene expression was quantified
using real-time PCR. The reaction mixture consisted of 25 ml of � 2 Power SYBR
Green master mix, 1 ml of 10 mM forward and reverse primer each (primer
sequence provided in Supplementary Table 2), 22 ml water and 1 ml cDNA (50 ng)
in a final reaction volume of 50 ml, in triplicates. Real-time PCR was performed
using Eppendorf Mastercycler RealPlex 2. Relative gene expression was analysed
using DDCt methods using GAPDH as endogenous control for normalization.
Relative fold changes in expression levels are represented.
Flow cytometry analysis of side population. Actively growing cells were tryp-
sinised and resuspended in growth medium at 106 cells per ml. One millilitre of cell
suspension was treated with Hoechst 33342 (5 mg ml � 1) for 90 min at 37 �C. Cells
were pelleted and resuspended in ice-cold PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum and
propidium iodide (2 mg ml � 1). Live cells were analysed by flow cytometry (BD
LSRII); cells with low Hoechst blue and red staining were considered for side
population analysis.
Immunohistochemistry. All reagents other than primary antibodies were from
Leica Biosystems (Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK) and staining procedures were
performed using Leica Bond-III. For immunohistochemical analysis of protein
expression, 3 mm paraffin sections from fimbrial and proximal end of fallopian
tube (HOXC4 and AID expression) were treated for automated dewaxing (Leica
Bond Dewax AR9222). Automated antigen retrieval was then performed on the
sections. Citrate based, pH 6.0 Leica Bond ER1 (HOXC4) or Tris-EDTA based, pH
9.0 Leica Bond ER2 (AID) was applied to the slides before heating to 100 �C
(30 min for HOXC4 and 20 min for AID). Primary antibodies against HOXC4
(dilution 1/30) or AID (1/3,800) were applied to the respective slides with 15 min
incubations. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked using 3–4% (v/v) hydrogen
peroxide (Part of Leica Bond Refine Polymer Kit, DS9800). An anti-rabbit
secondary antibody (Bond Post Primary, part of the Leica Bond Refine Polymer
Kit, DS9800) was applied for 8 min for HOXC4. For AID, an anti-rat secondary
reagent (Vector Laboratories cat # AI-4001, diluted 1/100) was applied for 15 min.
Signal visualization was performed using Bond Polymer (Part of Polymer Refine
Polymer Kit, cat # DS9800, HRP based) for 8 min for all antibodies. DAB was
applied for 10 min for all slides, then Leica Bond DAB enhancer (copper sulfate,
concentration proprietary) was applied for 5 min. Cell nuclei were counterstained
with haematoxylin, then dehydrated and mounted in DPX-based mountant. The
Leica Bond Polymer Detection Kit (DS9800) was used for peroxidase blocking,
visualization and counterstaining. Bond Wash (AR9590) and deionized water were
used for washing steps between reagent steps. AID and HOXC4 staining was
observed at the fimbrial and proximal ends of the same fallopian tubes, among
controls and BRCA mutation carriers. Relative intensity of AID or HOXC4 staining
was scored by experienced pathologists (RA and JM). Scores for cytoplasmic and
nuclear intensity (on a scale of 1–3) times percentage of positive cells were derived
independently for the proximal and the fimbrial fallopian tube regions. The scoring
was done by two independent pathologists blinded for the BRCA status.
Immunofluorescence staining. Primary fimbrial secretory epithelial cells were
cultured on coverslips in six-well plates. Cells were washed three times with PBS
and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were
permealized using 0.5% Triton-X 100. Blocking was done using bovine serum
albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were treated with primary antibodies
for PAX8 (Source Biosceince, Rabbit polyclonal, 1/1,000) or Cytokeratin 7 (Rabbit
monoclonal antibody- EPR1619Y; Abcam, catalogue: ab68459; dilution: 1/500)
diluted in blocking buffer and incubated at 4 �C overnight. Cells were washed with
PBST, and stained with secondary antibody (Fluorescein Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG
Antibody; Victor laboratories, catalogue: FI-1000, 10 mg ml � 1) for 1 h at room
temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst 33352 (2 mM) and observed
under an inverted microscope. Washing between steps was carried out using PBST.
Data-processing and analysis. DNA methylation data were obtained via the
Illumina HumanMethylation 450 K array, relating to healthy fimbrial and proximal
tissue samples as well as the cell line experiments outlined above. In addition, ovarian
cancer samples were incorporated into the analyses illustrated in Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Figs 13 and 15. Fallopian tube data are available from the Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) under accession number GSE74845 and ovarian cancer
data are available under accession number GSE72021. All methylation data were
background-corrected, without further normalization. Samples were removed if they
had o 80% coverage across probes, and probes were subsequently removed if they
had o95% coverage across samples. Any remaining probes with detection p-value
40.05 were replaced by KNN imputation, with k ¼ 5. We note that under testing
with the additional data-processing steps of removal of the 93,382 cross-reactive/
polymorphic 450k probes of Chen et al.40, and normalization with the SWAN or
BMIQ methods, all results and their overall significance levels were unchanged.
P-values were obtained quantifying the observed methylation differences
between fimbrial and proximal samples using LIMMA (linear modelling for
microarray experiments)41. This was carried out separately for BRCA1/2 MUT and
control samples, and histograms of these p-values appear in Fig. 1b. On the basis of
these tests, lists of significant CpGs in BRCA1/2 MUT and control were identified
according to FDR corrected po0.05. The difference between these lists provides a
list of CpGs significant in BRCA1/2 MUT and not in control samples.
CpGs were then further selected as significant only when they corresponded to
Db greater than a set threshold. For fimb-prox (BRCA1/2 MUT) comparisons, this
threshold was set at median Db40.03 (with the median calculated across all
BRCA1/2 MUT samples), these CpGs appear in Supplementary Data 1 and 2. We
expanded on this choice of threshold of 0.03, as follows: There is heterogeneity of
DNA methylation at a given CpG locus in a given anatomical region (that is,
fimbrial or proximal tube) within a given volunteer, and from volunteer to
volunteer; by selecting all CpGs above this threshold median Db of 0.03 we found a
large number of CpGs showing a much greater methylation change than 0.03 for
many volunteers; specifically, of those CpGs selected with median Db 4 0.03, on
average 40% of volunteers showed Db 40.1, and 13% show Db 40.2; for the cell
lines, the threshold was set as Db (AID overexpression—empty vector) 40.3 in
FT11 (these CpGs are shown in Supplementary Data 5 and 6), 0.1 in FT8, 0.07 in
FT7, 0.15 in HOC7 and 0.07 in SKOV3.
Genes were then identified as significant in fimb-prox and in the cell lines by
carrying out a binomial test for each gene, at a significance level of FDR corrected
po0.05. These tests were carried out separately for hypermethylated and
hypomethylated CpGs, leading to two lists of significant genes. Also based on these
lists of significant genes, GSEA was carried out, as follows: A list of 6,811 gene set
definitions, downloaded from the Broad Institute Molecular Signatures Database
(http://www.broadinstitute.org), were tested one by one for enrichment by the lists
of significant genes; these enrichment tests were carried out using one-sided
Fisher’s exact tests, and gene-sets were identified as significant according to FDR
po0.05. These GSEA results appear in Supplementary Data 3 and 4.
The significance p-values shown in Fig. 4 were calculated as follows: The log of
the expression levels in (b) and (d) were assumed to follow a normal distribution,
and hence two-sided t-tests based on logs of the plotted values were used; the
count-data on which the percentages shown in (c) and (g) are based were assumed
to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean great enough to make a Gaussian
approximation, and hence t-tests were again used. The data shown in (a) and (e)
were assumed to be drawn from an unknown distribution and hence two-sided
Wilcox tests were used.

eFORGE analysis for this study focused on (a) CpGs discriminating fimbrial from
proximal samples (fimb-prox), and on (b) CpGs distinguishing AID-overexpressing
FT11 cells from empty vector controls. Analysis was performed on the top 1,000 hypo-
and hypermethylated CpGs in (a) and (b), generating 1,000 random 450k background
sets for each input list, selecting background probes with similar gene and CpG Island
annotation. eFORGE analysis was also performed on CpGs hypo- and hypermethylated
upon AID overexpression in FT7, FT8, HOC7 and SKOV3 cells.
Data availability. The DNA methylation microarray data from human tissues that
support the findings of this study have been deposited in Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) data repository under accession codes GSE74845 and GSE72021.
