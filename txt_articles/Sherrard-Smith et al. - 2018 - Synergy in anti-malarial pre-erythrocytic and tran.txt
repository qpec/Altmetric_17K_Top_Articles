Abstract Anti-malarial pre-erythrocytic vaccines (PEV) target transmission by inhibiting human
infection but are currently partially protective. It has been posited, but never demonstrated, that
co-administering transmission-blocking vaccines (TBV) would enhance malaria control. We
hypothesized a mechanism that TBV could reduce parasite density in the mosquito salivary glands,
thereby enhancing PEV efficacy. This was tested using a multigenerational population assay,
passaging Plasmodium berghei to Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. A combined efficacy of 90.8%
(86.7–94.2%) was observed in the PEV +TBV antibody group, higher than the estimated efficacy of
83.3% (95% CrI 79.1–87.0%) if the two antibodies acted independently. Higher PEV efficacy at
lower mosquito parasite loads was observed, comprising the first direct evidence that co-
administering anti-sporozoite and anti-transmission interventions act synergistically, enhancing PEV
efficacy across a range of TBV doses and transmission intensities. Combining partially effective
vaccines of differing anti-parasitic classes is a pragmatic, powerful way to accelerate malaria
elimination efforts.

Introduction
Malaria remains a major global health challenge with an estimated 216 million new cases
and
445,000
deaths
in
2016
(World
Health
Organization,
2017).
Whilst
current
tools
have substantially reduced the global burden of disease, new tools will be needed to achieve
malaria elimination (Walker et al., 2016). Early development of malaria vaccines focused on either
the pre-erythrocytic stage vaccine (PEV) – eliciting an immune response to prevent incoming sporo-
zoites from establishing patent infection – or blood-stage – boosting natural responses to surface
proteins on the infected erythrocytes (Schwartz et al., 2012). The first malaria vaccine RTS,S/AS01
to complete Phase III trials is a PEV vaccine and has been demonstrated to be partially effective,
reducing clinical incidence in 5 – 17-month-old children by 36.3% (95%CI: 31.8 – 40.5%) over 40
months follow-up (RTSS Clinical Trials Partnership, 2015). Further candidate PEV vaccines include
those that achieve protective immunity through irradiated/chemo-attenuated Plasmodium falcipa-
rum sporozoites, (e.g. PfSPZ vaccines [Seder et al., 2013]), those that use viral vectors to induce
T-cell responses to provide protection (de Barra et al., 2014; MVVC group et al., 2015) and the
promising next-generation RTS,S-like vaccine, R21 (Collins et al., 2017). A range of vaccines that tar-
get human-to-mosquito transmission by attacking sexual, sporogonic, and/or mosquito antigens

 (transmission-blocking vaccines, TBV) are also under development (Talaat et al., 2016; Wu et al.,
2008). Pre-clinical investigations have identified multiple antigens (e.g. Pfs25, P230, P48/45) as tar-
gets for TBV candidates that, when administered, can reduce transmission to mosquitoes
(Hoffman et al., 2015; Sauerwein and Richie, 2015), but complete, or reproducible, translation to
the clinic has not been achieved so far (Talaat et al., 2016; Hoffman et al., 2015; Sauerwein and
Richie, 2015).
One of the major challenges encountered in developing PEV malaria vaccines is the partial pro-
tection achieved against each exposure, despite high levels of induced antibody titres. It has been
hypothesized that this may be in part due to the over-dispersed distribution of sporozoites in each
infectious bite, such that despite inducing a high per-parasite killing efficacy, the probability that at
least one parasite reaches the liver and progresses to blood-stage infection remains high
(White et al., 2013; Bejon et al., 2005). The classical approach to overcoming this is to attempt to
further increase either the quantity, breadth or quality of the immune response (Remarque et al.,
2012; Courtin et al., 2009; Chaudhury et al., 2016). We hypothesized that an alternative mecha-
nism would be to combine a PEV with approaches that reduce the number of sporozoites in the
mosquito salivary glands. TBVs have been demonstrated to act in this way, reducing ookinete and
sporozoite density (Bompard et al., 2017; Blagborough et al., 2013). We sought therefore to iden-
tify whether this mechanism could result in synergistic interactions between PEVs and TBVs co-
administered within a population.
To test this hypothesis, we used an established murine population assay to investigate the clear-
ance
of
malaria
over
multiple
generations
in
a
controlled
laboratory
environment
(Blagborough et al., 2013). Here, the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei is passed
between populations of mice by the direct feeding of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. To simulate
eLife digest In 2016, malaria caused an estimated 216 million illnesses and 445,000 confirmed
deaths globally. The disease is caused by a parasite, and mosquitos infected with the parasite
transmit them to humans when they bite. In humans, the parasites enter the body and head to the
liver before spending part of their life cycle in red blood cells, which cause the symptoms of the
disease.
Prevention efforts have reduced the burden of malaria but eliminating the disease will require
new tools. One option is to use vaccines. The world’s first malaria vaccine – a so-called pre-
erythrocytic vaccine (PEV) – targets the stages preceding the parasite reaching the liver. This vaccine
prevents malaria parasites from infecting people, but it is only partially effective. Scientists are also
developing transmission-blocking vaccines (TBVs). These TBVs block the development of malaria
parasites in mosquitos that bite vaccinated humans. So far, the most promising TBV candidates are
also only partly effective.
It is possible that using PEV and TBV vaccines together could boost their effectiveness, since the
TBV vaccines reduce the number of parasites that infect each mosquito. This means that fewer
parasites are injected into the next person. Currently, the PEVs work better when there are fewer
parasites infecting a person.
Now, Sherrard-Smith et al. show that combining TBVs with PEVs enhances their antimalarial
effects. In the experiments, Sherrard-Smith et al. treated mice with either TBV or PEV vaccines, or
both. Then, the mice were exposed to mosquitos infected with the malaria parasite. As expected,
the TBV and PEV treatments were only partially effective when used alone. But exposing the mice to
both TBVs and PEVs eliminated the parasites from the mosquitos and the mice.
The combined benefit of TBVs and PEVs were greater than would be expected if either vaccine
was acting alone and the effects were simply multiplied, suggesting they enhance each other’s
effects. More studies of TBVs in humans are needed to prove they are safe and effective in the real
world. More studies also are needed to confirm what Sherrard-Smith et al. found in mice would
happen in humans treated with a combination of TBV and PEV vaccines. But if such future studies
prove this combination approach is effective, it could be a powerful tool in the fight against malaria.

 the antibody response to a PEV, a monoclonal antibody (mAb-3D11) - which targets the same corre-
sponding parasite circumsporozoite protein (CSP) as RTS,S – was passively transferred (intrave-
nously) into mice. To act as a partially effective PEV (broadly comparable to RTS,S), a mAb-3D11
dose was selected which reduces mosquito-to-mouse transmission probability by ~50% (as evaluated
in naive mouse populations, transfused with differing doses of 3D11, challenged with five mosquito
bites, see Materials and methods). Sterilizing immunity of 47.2% was titrated over multiple chal-
lenges. The complementary actions of a TBV antibody response were simulated using an anti-Pfs25
monoclonal antibody 4B7 (mAb-4B7), administered by passive transfer, which targets the same para-
site stages as the most currently advanced human TBV candidate, Pfs25 (Talaat et al., 2016). This
well-established transmission-blocking monoclonal antibody was used in combination with a trans-
genic P. berghei (PbPfs25DR3) parasite that expresses Pfs25 in place of its rodent homologue.
PbPfs25DR3 is phenotypically indistinguishable to WT P. berghei, expresses Pfs25 on the surface of
the zygote/ookinete, and has been used previously to assay a range of TBVs (Goodman et al.,
2011; Kapulu et al., 2015). A series of transfused mAb-4B7 doses were tested in multiple (n = 6)
direct feeding assays to titrate the appropriate doses to generate a 50%, 65% and 85% reduction in
transmission to the mosquito (measured as reduction in oocyst prevalence) (see Materials and
methods).
Figure 1. Summary outcome data. The number in each box (and the color) shows the percentage of mice infected for each treatment arm of the
experiment by transmission cycle and biting rate (the number of potentially infectious mosquito bites received per mouse). In transmission cycle 0, all
mice are infected (not shown), where a TBV antibody is administered (top row: purple and blue) infections in mice are progressively reduced. The
antibody works best at the higher dose (TBV 85%) and lower biting rates. The PEV antibody (lower row: yellow and green) is effective at lower biting
rates (where each mouse received one or two potentially infectious mosquito bites per transmission cycle) but is not able to reduce infection at higher
biting rates. In combination, at any biting rate, the combined antibodies (lower row: orange) always cleared infections by transmission cycle 2.

 We undertook a series of experiments with either PEV alone, TBV alone at three different effica-
cies (50%, 65% and 85%), or combinations of the two across four generations of transmission. For
each experiment mice were exposed to either 1, 2, 5 or 10 infectious mosquito bites to allow estima-
tion of combined transmission-blocking efficacies between 20% and 100% (Materials and methods).
Results
At lower TBV antibody dose exposure levels (50% and 65%), the probability of eliminating all para-
sites from the mouse/mosquito populations was greater when PEV and TBV antibodies were admin-
istered together compared to singly, irrespective of the dose of the TBV antibody administered
(Figure 1). Using statistical methods that explicitly capture parasite density and account for the
impact of the interventions on both the prevalence and density of infection (Sherrard-Smith et al.,
2017), we estimated PEV antibody alone to reduce the prevalence of infection by 48.0% (95% credi-
ble interval, CrI, 36.6–58.0%). Similarly, use of TBV antibody alone reduced the prevalence of infec-
tion by 33.9% (95% CrI: 18.2–47.4%), 74.3% (65.7%–82.4%) and 95.8% (90.2%–100%) for the 50%,
65% and 85% individual efficacy titres, respectively. If the actions of the two antibody types were to
act independently, the predicted combined efficacy would be 83.3% (79.1–87.0%). A substantially
higher efficacy of 90.8% (86.7–94.2%) (p=0.0035) was observed in the PEV +TBV antibody group,
indicating a synergistic interaction (Table 1). Here, the 95% Credible Intervals did not overlap the
median estimates, demonstrating a significant difference between the two treatments. The same
relationship was observed when examining vaccine efficacy against parasite density (p=0.0025)
(Table 1).
Sub-dividing the data by TBV antibody dose, the greatest synergistic enhancement in efficacy
against parasite prevalence was seen at lower doses of functional TBV antibodies (Figure 2). A TBV

pendently, and greater than one shows synergy.

 antibody dose which reduces mouse-to-mosquito transmission by 50% increased the efficacy of PEV
antibody prevalence to 82.2% (74.6–88.9%) compared to an expected 65% (57.7–73.2%) efficacy if
the vaccines acted independently, a strong indication of synergy (p=0.0015). Similar synergistic
effects against parasite density were observed (Figure 2, p <0.0001). Weaker synergistic effects
were observed against parasite prevalence and density for the PEV +TBV antibody at the 65% dose
(Figure 2, p=0.0675, 0.02, respectively) (Table 1). At the highest TBV antibody dose (85%), the TBV
alone already reduced parasites in the population to low levels, hence there was insufficient power
to detect further synergy between the interventions as all parasites were eliminated from the experi-
mental population (Figure 1).

 The impact of circulating TBV antibody on the reduction of parasites within the mosquito explains
the greater efficacy of the PEV antibody in the combination treatment groups. The presence of TBV
antibody (mAb-4B7) reduced oocyst counts in infected mosquitoes (ANOVA: F1,1525 = 75.3,
p<0.0001). Similarly, TBV antibody presence reduced sporozoite density in infected mosquitoes
(ANOVA: F1,707 = 163.9, p<0.0001). Figure 3A,B and C further illustrate the effect that TBVs have
on sporozoite density distribution for the TBV-50%, 65% and 85% single treatment groups respec-
tively. At each dose, the tail of the distribution of sporozoites is curtailed progressively across trans-
mission cycles. Figure 3D illustrates that the efficacy of the PEV is density-dependent, with higher
efficacy achieved when mosquitoes have lower sporozoite density.
Discussion
The efficacy of multiple PEV and TBV candidates against rodent and human parasites have been
shown to depend on parasite density; TBV (anti-Pfs25, anti-Pfs48/45 and immune blocking serum)
efficacy decreases with increased parasite dose (Churcher et al., 2012; Miura et al., 2016) and a
representative PEV (RTS,S) only provides sterilizing immunity in volunteers against lightly infected
mosquitoes (Churcher et al., 2017). This suggests that both types of vaccine can halt transmission
against a defined (but currently uncharacterized) quantity of parasites, which is enough to prevent

distribution in mosquitoes across transmission cycles for the (A) 50% dose, (B) 65% dose and (C) 85% dose. (A–C) demonstrate that the sporozoite

sporozoites per mosquito) tend toward zero for successive transmission rounds. (D) The efficacy of the PEV antibodies to prevent mosquito-to-mouse-
to-mosquito transmission (a percentage reduction in sporozoite infections in mosquitoes) is greatest at lower mosquito parasite densities (as assessed
by sporozoite score following blood-feeding).

 onward infection in lightly infected mosquitoes/humans, but that onward transmission is still possible
from heavily infected mosquitoes or individuals.
Here, a partially effective TBV antibody reduced the number of parasites in infected mosquitoes,
ensuring that the PEV antibodies encounter fewer parasites than would otherwise be expected if
only a single antibody/vaccine class was administered in isolation. Thus, the subsequently reduced
parasite burden increased the efficacy of the PEV when co-administered with a TBV. Potentially, a
synergistic response could be induced by an unspecified biochemical or immunological interaction
between the two vaccines. This explanation can be discounted within this system as the experimen-
tal design results in mosquito-to-mouse transmission being measured prior to the administration of
a transmission-blocking intervention (passive transfer of mAb-4B7 1 hr prior to blood feed) as a new,
naive batch of mice were infected in each generation.
The greatest synergy was observed in the lower TBV dose group, although it is likely to operate
across all TBV and PEV doses when vaccine reduces parasite density but fails to clear infection from
host or vector. The 85% TBV dose administered alone eliminated the parasite over a single genera-
tion without the action of the PEV so there was no opportunity to show synergy. A 100% efficacious
PEV or TBV would not require augmenting with an alternative vaccine, although their efficacy is still
likely to drop over time as antibodies decay so combining highly effective vaccine may still be advan-
tageous depending on the relative rates of antibody loss.
While the direct translatability of rodent experiments to human health is variable, this approach is
invaluable to demonstrate unequivocally that the mechanism behind the observed synergy is the
direct result of TBV antibody reducing parasite density in infected mice and thereby enabling the
density-dependent PEV antibody to be optimal (Figure 3). This mechanism is very likely to mirror
that for humans, which cannot be tested directly due to ethical considerations and complex environ-
mental variation. Whilst the murine system uses P. berghei, the mechanism of action of the PEV anti-
bodies administered is matched to the antibody-based mechanism of the RTS,S vaccine; that is
sporozoite invasion of the liver is inhibited by the presence of CSP-targeted antibodies in mice both
in vivo and ex vivo (Gru
¨ner et al., 2003). The P. berghei strain used here is genetically modified to
express the human TBV candidate, P. falciparum P25 (Pfs25) in place of its P. berghei counterpart.

a

(4B7)
can

model
(Goodman et al., 2011). The evidence that co-administering TBV and PEV antibodies can accelerate
toward controlling malaria transmission is a first step toward trialing such combinations in more natu-
ral parasite-vector-host combinations and environments. There is good reason to believe that the
population dynamics of parasites and partially effective vaccines may be similar in human malaria.
Transmission of human malaria from human-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human is also considered
to depend on the density of the parasite (Churcher et al., 2013; Sinden et al., 2007). The average
number of oocysts in wild caught mosquitoes is likely to be substantially lower than the numbers
observed in the rodent system (Rosenberg, 2008) but oocyst distribution is highly over-dispersed
(Medley et al., 1993) meaning that some mosquitoes have very-high-density infections. These
highly infected mosquitoes are likely to be more infectious, so reducing their frequency through add-
ing a TBV, could have additional impact on overall transmission. The epidemiological importance of
any synergistic interaction between vaccine types in the field is hard to predict and will depend on
many confounding factors such as human immunity, drug treatment, vector susceptibility, antigen
escape, amongst others. Transmission is likely to be highly heterogeneous, caused by factors such as
vaccine non-responders and super-transmitting hosts. The impact of different types of heterogeneity
can be investigated under controlled laboratory scenarios using the murine population assay, varying
the vaccinated coverage, antibody dose and changing biting heterogeneity within a population. This
could help understand the relative importance of these different heterogeneities and could be used
to support the design of appropriately powered Phase III trials (or alternative trial designs) to fully
assess the impact of combining vaccine components with alternative mechanisms of action.
There is no ‘magic bullet’ intervention against malaria and the current global strategy is to com-
bine vector control and drug treatment tools in a timely manner to move towards malaria elimina-
tion. Our results suggest that the same approach might be taken for the use of vaccines and
comprises the first practical demonstration that combining TBVs and PEVs may have auxiliary bene-
fits. Synergism between PEV and TBVs could potentially enhance the efficacy of the current PEV vac-
cines, resulting in reduced burden and potentially elimination in areas where it was not previously
possible. The development of novel anti-malarial vaccines is both costly and time-consuming.

 Combining partially effective vaccines of differing anti-parasitic classes may be therefore a pragmatic
and powerful way to accelerate malaria elimination efforts. Synergism between PEV, TBVs and
potentially a blood-stage vaccine (either administered separately or as a multi-component vaccine)
could potentially enhance the efficacy of single vaccines, resulting in reduced burden and potentially
elimination in areas where it was not previously possible.

Transmission-blocking vaccine surrogate: monoclonal antibody 4B7
(mAb-4B7)
The TBV mAb-4B7 neutralises the protein Pfs25 in sexual stages of the human malaria P. falciparum
and reduces transmission of the parasite from host-to-mosquito (Stura et al., 1994). The transgenic
murine malaria parasite, P. berghei PbPfs25DR3, expressing native Pfs25 in place of its rodent
homologue, was used so that the same TBV antibody candidate could be examined within a mouse
model (Goodman et al., 2011). MAb-4B7 was administered and examined at sub-optimal concen-
trations titrated to reduce oocyst prevalence in the mosquito midgut (as assessed using a direct
feeding assay) by either 50, 65 or 85%. Given the severity of malaria, the WHO, the Strategic Advi-
sory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization and the Malaria Policy Advisory Committee (MPAC)
recommended the RTS,S vaccine could be implemented in pilot countries in October 2015 (http://
www.malariavaccine.org/malaria-and-vaccines/first-generation-vaccine/rtss,
accessed
04/04/2018)
when the vaccine was demonstrating relatively low efficacies of just 36.3% in children aged 5 to 17
months (RTSS Clinical Trials Partnership, 2015). These TBV doses were chosen to bridge a range of
malaria vaccine efficacies that might be acceptable by WHO, SAGE and MPAC. Briefly, to titrate the
appropriate dose, female Tuck Ordinary (TO) mice (6–8 weeks old, Harlan, UK) were treated with
phenylhydrazine, and three days later, infected with 106 P. berghei PbPfs25DR3 (Goodman et al.,
2011). Three days later, infected mice were injected intravenously (i.v.) with 200 ml of purified mAb-
4B7 at a range of doses. Negative control mice were transfused with 200 ml of phosphate buffered
saline (PBS). After 1 hr, mice were anesthetised and 50 Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes (line SD
500, previously starved for 24 hr) were allowed to feed on each individual mouse. Mosquitoes were
maintained as described in (Blagborough et al., 2013), and after 10 days, 50 mosquitoes were dis-
sected and microscopically examined to measure oocyst intensity and prevalence. This was repeated
five times, with i.v. administered doses of mAb-4B7 ranging from 0 mg to 750 mg. Prevalence efficacy
was estimated as a function of mAb-4B7 concentration using a generalised linear model framework
(Bolker et al., 2009) in which experimental replicate was treated as a random effect. A Gompertz
function (Churcher et al., 2013) was fitted to the data using maximum likelihood methods. Mean
concentrations were estimated using the best-fitting model (determined by log-likelihood tests) with
95% confidence intervals obtained from the profile likelihood. We estimated that a mAb-4B7 dose
of 284.2 mg i.v (244.7–337.3 mg) was required to achieve a reduction in prevalence of 50%, a dose of
371.8 mg i.v (319.8–442.8 mg) for 65% reduction and a dose of 629.5 mg i.v (525–777.1 mg) for an
85% reduction. These calculated doses were then used in the mosquito-mouse model system as
described below.
Pre-erythrocytic vaccine surrogate: monoclonal antibody 3D11 (mAb-
3D11)
The anti-P. berghei CSP mAb-3D11 (Mishra et al., 2012) is mechanistically similar to the recently
registered RTS,S vaccine for human malaria, in that the presence of CSP-targeted antibodies in mice
inhibit sporozoite invasion of the liver both in vivo and ex vivo (Gru
¨ner et al., 2003). An appropriate
dose for mAb-3D11 was estimated from 40 individual passive transfers, administering a range of
mAb-3D11 doses (0–150 mg i.v.) to mice (5 to 10 mice per experiment) and determining the

 prevalence efficacy at the given dose. A logistic function was fitted to these data using RStan
(Stan Development Team, 2017) to determine the mean dose and 95% credible intervals that pro-
duces a ~50% reduction in the probability of infection. Consequently, mAb-3D11 antibody was
administered at a single sub-optimal dose (50 mg i.v.) that prevented 47.2% (38.0–62.0% 95%CI) of
transmission to mice that each received 5 potentially infectious mosquito bites. This dose was
selected to match the approximate observed protection by RTS,S in human clinical trials.
The mosquito-mouse model system
The mouse-to-mouse transmission model has been described in detail previously (Upton et al.,
2015; Blagborough et al., 2013) (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). Briefly, five female (TO) mice
(6–8 weeks old, Harlan, UK) were treated with phenylhydrazine, and, 3 days later, were infected with
106 P. berghei PbPfs25DR3 (Goodman et al., 2011). Three days later, groups of infected mice were
treated with the TBV antibody. After 1 hr, the mice were anesthetised and 500 An. stephensi mos-
quitoes (line SD 500, starved for 24 hr) fed randomly on the five infected mice within each group.
Mosquitoes were maintained as described in Blagborough et al., 2013. After 10 days, a sub-sample
of 50 mosquitoes were microscopically examined to measure oocyst intensity and prevalence. After
21 days post-feeding, sporozoites are present in the salivary glands and are maximally infectious to
the vertebrate host (Blagborough et al., 2013). At this point, pre-defined numbers of mosquitoes
(to simulate mosquito biting rates of 1, 2, 5 and 10 mosquito bites per mouse) were then randomly
selected from the remaining mosquitoes and fed, for 20 min, on anesthetized mice from a naı
¨ve
Figure 4. Evidence of a synergistic effect of parasite prevalence (A–D) or parasite density (E–H) of combining TBV monoclonal antibody (mAb-4B7) with
PEV mAb-3D11. The frequency histograms show the probability that antibodies administered together have a higher efficacy than if they acted
independently. In all panels, the vertical black line highlights the value 1, above this line indicates synergy, below it denotes an antagonistic interaction
and falling at one indicates that the antibodies are acting independently (evidence for synergy p<0.1., p<0.05*, p<0.01**, p<0.001***). Taking all data
together (A and E), there is a synergistic effect of combining vaccine antibodies as the majority of iterations fall above 1. This effect is stronger at lower
doses of mAb-4B7 (B, C, F and G, note the different x-axes values indicating stronger support for lower TBV antibody doses), and stronger against
parasite density (E–H) than parasite prevalence.

 cohort. The mosquito biting rate is an aspect of the experimental design that can be varied to be
able to estimate the effect size more precisely. If the mosquito biting rate is small (say 1 or 2), the
probability that the infection is eliminated rapidly in the intervention arm of the experiment is high
(>80%) for TBD/TBV with efficacies above 40%. Thus, we cannot discriminate at a low mosquito bit-
ing rate between a TBD/TBV with 60% efficacy and one with 80% efficacy (they both eliminate).
However, we do obtain a high degree of discrimination between an efficacy of 20% and one of 40%.
Thus, a small mosquito biting rate is needed to get a precise estimate of the effect size of a TBD/
TBV with lower efficacy. The converse also holds, so that a high mosquito biting rate (up to around
10 based on our initial experiment) is needed to obtain a precise estimate of a TBV/TBD with >80%
efficacy. Using multiple mosquito biting rates increases the overall precision of our estimate of prev-
alence efficacy.
Each group of mice (five mice per group) either received the PEV antibody or no -intervention
(negative control). Engorged mosquitoes were microscopically examined immediately after feeding
to determine the number of sporozoites in the salivary glands. After 10 days, blood smears from
each mouse were microscopically examined to determine the percentage parasitemia. These five
mice were then given either the TBV antibody at the desired dose to achieve a 50%, 65% or 85%
reduction in oocyst prevalence as required, or no intervention/control (in accordance with the
respective treatment arm). A new cohort of 500 naive mosquitoes was then allowed to blood feed
on the mice. This mouse-to-mouse transmission cycle was repeated to a maximum of four cycles
after the seeding mouse population or until no parasites had been detected in the system for two
successive transmission cycles. The PEV and TBV antibodies at each dose (corresponding to a reduc-
tion in transmission to mosquitoes of 50%, 65% and 85%) were tested singly and in combination.
Initial parasite density was measured by counting the number of infected red blood cells (out of a
total subsample of 1200 erythrocytes). The number of sporozoites in the salivary glands following
blood feeding was counted on the logarithmic scale (scores of 0–4 representing 0, 1–10, 11–100,
101–1000, 1000 + sporozoites, respectively). The data are provided in Table 1—source data 1.
Ethics statement
All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the terms of the UK Animals (Scientific
Procedures) Act (PPL 70/8788) and were approved by the Imperial College Animal Welfare and Ethi-
cal Review Body (AWERB) LASA guidelines were adhered to at all points. The Office of Laboratory
Animal Welfare Assurance for Imperial College covers all Public Health Service supported activities
involving live vertebrates in the US (no. A5634-01).
Statistical analysis
The complexity of the population assay requires non-standard methods of statistical analyses that
can account for the non-linear dynamics of transmission and stochastic fluctuations seen by the rela-
tively small number of mice used in each generation and treatment arm. These methods need to be
able to determine whether the interaction between the different antibodies, that simulate vaccine-
triggered antibodies, is below what would be expected if vaccine effects were less strong than
expected if effects were multiplied (sub-multiplicative), independent of the presence of the other
vaccine (multiplicative) or synergistic, in that effects are enhanced for one or both vaccine types
(super-multiplicative).
A density model was developed specifically for this purpose (described in full, [Sherrard-
Smith et al., 2017], Figure 1—figure supplement 1). The structure of the model captures the
experimental set up and fits explicitly to parasite densities during successive life stages to generate
more precise estimates of simulated vaccine efficacy than the direct comparison of raw data alone,
which can fluctuate widely due to chance (as each generation only has five mice) (Table 1—source
data 1). Stochastic elimination (or resurgence) is possible in the mouse system given the ethical
necessity to keep the mouse populations in each generation small; as only five mice are used so
transmission could be halted or enhanced by natural variability in the physiological response from
each individual mouse. The statistical mode, however, explicitly addresses this variation by modeling
the distribution of pathogens at each stage of transmission for each mouse individually. By explicitly
incorporating the heterogeneity in the mouse pathogen load the model avoids bias in the inference
of the transmission process itself. All parameters were fitted jointly using a Bayesian posterior

 distribution in RStan (version 2.13.1, [Stan Development Team, 2017]). To ensure robust fits, a non-
centered parameterization method was employed (Papaspiliopoulos et al., 2007; Betancourt and
Girolami, 2015). The model parameter fitting was achieved using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
method (Stan Development Team, 2017), warmup was 500 and the subsequent 500 samples from
each chain (n = 4) were used for the posterior predictive checks (Sherrard-Smith et al., 2017). The
model was validated by visualizing the observed raw data measurements of parasite density in mice,
the oocyst counts and the logarithmic counts of sporozoites in mosquitoes against model predic-
tions. The data were analyzed at different scales, first taking all data together before breaking down
the impact by the dose of the TBV antibody.
The prevalence efficacy against infections in mice is the percentage difference in the proportion
of infected hosts between the control and treatment arms of the experiment. The parasite density
efficacy against infections in mice is the percentage difference in the mean parasite density per host
between the control and treatment arms of the experiment. (Similarly, efficacies can be calculated
for the reduction in oocysts or sporozoites in mosquito populations.)
Efficacy estimates were generated for each arm of the experiment, for each posterior draw of the
model (2000 posterior draws). This allows mean and 95% credible intervals to be calculated for each
treatment group (c) and across mosquito biting rates (m) and transmission cycles (i). Let Pj
c;m;iindicate
the prevalence of infected mice (j = 1) or the mean asexual parasite density in the mouse population
(j = 2). Treatment arm 0 represents the control data, and c indicates treatments 1 to 7 (TBV antibody
at 50%, 65%, 85% dose singly, PEV antibody singly, PEV and TBV antibody at 50%, 65% and 85%
dose together), such that,

(1)
where Ej
c;m;i is either the parasite prevalence efficacy (j = 1) or density efficacy (j = 2) against infec-
tions in mice as estimated by the posterior predictions of the density model (Table 1).
To statistically assess whether the interaction between PEV and TBV antibodies are antagonistic,
independent or synergistic, efficacy estimates against infections in mice for combined antibody
treatments were compared to the expected estimates if antibodies had an independent impact
(expected efficacy). To estimate this expected efficacy the single antibody treatment groups were
combined, as follows (VanderWeele and Knol, 2014):
Expected Efficacy ¼ Epev � 1 � Etbv;d
�
�
þ Etbv;d
(2)
where Etbv,d is the prevalence or density efficacy for the TBV antibody treatment alone (at the
specified TBV dose of d = 50%, 65% or 85%), and Epev is the prevalence or density efficacy for the
PEV alone. The ratio between efficacies for the combined treatments and the expected efficacy for
matched treatments was used to assess synergy. A synergistic interaction is indicated when this ratio
is greater than 1, an independent interaction when equal to one and an antagonistic impact if less
than 1 (Figure 4). The 95% credible intervals were calculated to give statistical support. Statistical
evidence of a difference in treatment and control experiments (p-value) was defined as one minus
the proportion of iterations from the model simulations that were greater than 1.
The observed synergy can be explained because the presence of TBV antibody reduces the spo-
rozoite score (as a measure of parasite density in the mosquito population) which allows the PEV
antibodies to achieve a greater efficiency. To understand whether the combined TBV antibody treat-
ments improved the action of the PEV at higher parasite densities, the raw data recording the sporo-
zoite scores of each mouse in the single treatment TBV antibody groups were plotted for each dose
and across transmission cycles to demonstrate that there are progressively more mosquitoes without
infection and progressively fewer mosquitoes with heavy infections (Figure 3). This highlights that
the PEV in the combined treatment groups is acting against progressively fewer parasites in each
transmission cycle because of the initial action of the TBV antibody. Simple analysis of variance was
performed to confirm that the presence of the respective antibody type (PEV acting against infec-
tions in mice, TBV acting against sporozoites in mosquitoes), as a binary covariate, could explain
reduced parasite counts in mosquitoes or mice. To demonstrate that the PEV antibody has a den-
sity-dependent impact, binomial logistic regression curves were fitted to determine the relationship

 between the prevalence efficacy of the PEV antibody and the parasite density in mosquitoes (mea-
sured as mean sporozoite score for each mosquito biting rate and transmission cycle, n = 16).
Parameters describing the regression curves were fitted using a Bayesian posterior distribution in
RStan (version 2.13.1, [Stan Development Team, 2017]). The model parameter fitting was achieved
using a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method (Stan Development Team, 2017), warmup was 1000 and
the subsequent 1000 samples from each chain (n = 4) were used for the posterior predictive checks
(Stan Development Team, 2017). All data analysis were conducted using the statistical software R
(version 3.2.2; [Core Team, 2014]).
