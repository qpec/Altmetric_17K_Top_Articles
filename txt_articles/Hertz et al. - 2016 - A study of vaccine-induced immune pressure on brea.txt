 same vaccine exerted immune pressure when tested in the Phambili Phase 2b study in a subtype C 
epidemic.
Materials and methods—A sieve analysis, which compares breakthrough viruses from placebo 
and vaccine arms, was performed on 277 near full-length genomes generated from 23 vaccine and 
20 placebo recipients. Vaccine coverage was estimated by computing the percentage of 9-mers that 
were exact matches to the vaccine insert.
Results—There was significantly greater protein distances from the vaccine immunogen 
sequence in Gag (p = 0.045) and Nef (p = 0.021) in viruses infecting vaccine recipients compared 
to placebo recipients. Twenty-seven putative sites of vaccine-induced pressure were identified (p < 
0.05) in Gag (n = 10), Pol (n = 7) and Nef (n = 10), although they did not remain significant after 
adjustment for multiple comparisons. We found the epitope sieve effect in Step was driven by 
HLA A*02:01; an allele which was found in low frequency in Phambili participants compared to 
Step participants. Furthermore, the coverage of the vaccine against subtype C Phambili viruses 
was 31%, 46% and 14% for Gag, Pol and Nef, respectively, compared to subtype B Step virus 
coverage of 56%, 61% and 26%, respectively.
Discussion—This study presents evidence of sieve effects in Gag and Nef; however could not 
confirm effects on specific amino acid sites. We propose that this weaker signal of vaccine 
immune pressure detected in the Phambili study compared to the Step study may have been 
influenced by differences in host genetics (HLA allele frequency) and reduced impact of vaccine-
induced immune responses due to mismatch between the viral subtype in the vaccine and infecting 
subtypes.

1. Introduction
Sieve analysis, which compares breakthrough viruses from placebo and vaccine arms, is a 
powerful tool for elucidating mechanisms of vaccine protection. There are two types of sieve 
effects: an acquisition sieve effect (exclusion of certain variants from establishing infection 
due to the ability of the vaccine to block certain viruses from establishing infection); or post-
infection sieve effects (occurs when vaccine-induced anamnestic responses influence the 
evolutionary outgrowth of specific HIV-1 variants) [1]. Sieve analysis has been successfully 
applied to two large vaccine trials, RV144 [2,3] and the Step study [4] (Merck 023/HVTN 
502 trial). While the RV144 vaccine trial showed modest protection [5], Step neither 
prevented infection nor reduced viral load [6], demonstrating that even in the absence of 
vaccine efficacy, there was vaccine-induced viral selection in breakthrough infections [4].
The Step Study was conducted in subtype-B epidemic regions and evaluated the Merck 
Adenovirus-5 (MrkAd5) Gag/Pol/Nef subtype-B vaccine, designed to elicit cytotoxic T-
lymphocyte (CTL) responses [6,7]. The Phambili study (HVTN 503), a Phase 2b placebo-
controlled preventive vaccine efficacy trial, was run in parallel with the Step Study and 
evaluated the same vaccine in a predominantly subtype-C epidemic region [8]. The Phambili 
Study was halted prematurely after an interim analysis of the Step study showed lack of

 efficacy [6]. Similar to Step, the Phambili study found that the vaccine neither prevented 
HIV-1 infection nor reduced viral load set-point post-infection, and showed trends of a 
higher HIV-1 infection rate in the vaccine group [4,8].
Sieve analysis of the Step study identified a greater divergence of predicted epitope 
sequences from the vaccine immunogen sequence in vaccine compared to placebo 
breakthrough infections [4]. One signature site was identified, Gag 84, which differentiated 
vaccine from placebo sequences and remained significant after stringent adjustment for 
multiple comparisons [4]. Here we report on a sieve analysis of 43 breakthrough-infected 
study participants from the Phambili study. We identified evidence of sieve effects however 
the effects observed were statistically weaker than those observed in the Step Study, and we 
evaluated how sample size, differing distribution of HLA alleles in the study populations, 
and mismatch between vaccine and infecting subtype, may have affected these findings.
2. Materials and methods
See supplementary materials for further details on methods.
2.1. Ethics statement
This study was approved by the University of Cape Town research ethics committee. The 
protocol was approved by all study sites and all participants gave informed consent after the 
nature and possible consequences of the studies had been fully explained [8].
2.2. Phambili cohort
Individuals were part of the Phambili double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 
2b study. The MrkAd5 HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef (Merck and Co., Inc.) vaccine insert was 
composed of the three subtype B sequences CAM-1/IIIB/JRFL.
Four digit high-resolution typing of class I HLA-A, -B, and -C loci was performed by DNA 
sequence-based typing (SBT) of exons 2 and 3 [9] using the dbMHC SBT interpretation 
interface (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gv/mhc/).
2.3. Near full-length genome sequencing
Near full-length HIV-1 genome sequences were generated using the limiting dilution/single 
genome amplification approach, followed by direct sequencing of PCR products [4,10] 
(GenBank accession numbers: KT183051–KT183341). The Step Study sequences were the 
same as those analyzed previously [4]. Data are also available online as an interactive 
visualization (http://sieve.fredhutch.org/viz).
2.4. Sequence analysis
Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic trees were generated using the GTR model of nucleotide 
substitution employed by PhyML [11]. For methods requiring one representative amino acid 
sequence per participant, the majority founder consensus sequence was used. Where there 
were multiple founder strains, the consensus sequence was calculated only from the founder

 that had the most observed sequences. Definition of complexity of transmitted variants was 
based on mathematical modeling combined with the phylogenetic approach [12].
Mean 9-mer epitope-coverage of the MrkAd5 vaccine was determined by a sliding 9-mer 
window using Epicover (www.hiv.lanl.gov) [13]. Potential coverage of the vaccine was 
calculated as the mean fraction of all 9-mer peptides in the MrkAd5 vaccine sequence that 
matched epitope-length peptides in the subtype-B or subtype-C sequence sets.
2.5. Testing for sieve effects
All of the statistical tests for sieve effects use two-sided p-values, to consider the possibility 
of differences between the treatment arms in either direction. P-values were unadjusted for 
multiple comparisons except where noted.
2.6. Global (protein) sieve analysis
Whole-protein pairwise distances of HIV-1 sequences from vaccine insert sequence were 
determined using (1) Hamming (mismatch) distance, (2) physicochemical similarity 
(‘‘global PCP”), calculated using z-scales that quantify structure-activity relationships 
between different amino acids [13–15,19]; and (3) the quasi-earth mover's distance (QEMD) 
[2,16]. Phylogenetic distance was calculated as the total branch length [2].
2.7. T Cell sieve methods
T cell based sieve methods were used in which HLA binding predictors, or annotated HIV 
epitopes from LANL, were to used compare the sequences of breakthrough viruses to the 
vaccine insert including: (1) Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope mismatch, (2) percent 
epitope mismatch, (3) HLA binding escape, (4) insertion/deletion (indel) binding escape, (5) 
HLA binding + indel escape, and (6) relative HLA binding escape.
2.8. Local sieve analysis methods
Distribution of amino acids at individual positions or within contiguous 9-mers were 
compared. To conserve statistical power, we excluded sites with low variability (treatment-
blinded). After filtering, 107 sites in Gag (19%), 65 sites in Nef (29%), and 109 sites in Pol 
(10%) remained for analysis. Three methods compared the amino acid distribution of 
breakthrough infections at individual sites against the residue found in the vaccine insert: (1) 
“Expected Gilbert, Wu, Jobes” method (EGWJ) which uses all sequences from all 
participants; (2) “Gilbert, Wu, Jobes” method (GWJ) [17] uses only the majority founder 
consensus sequence from each participant; and (3) the “Model-Based Sieve” (MBS) 
approach [18] that uses a Bayesian model comparison that is more sensitive to detect 
treatment effects that alter the distribution among non-vaccine-matched amino acids. One 
method, the “local PCP”, compared the distribution of the physicochemical properties of the 
site-specific residues between the treatment groups, not making use of the vaccine insert (or 
any other) reference sequence.
Contiguous 9-mer regions, rather than single amino acid sites, were also evaluated in order 
to be more sensitive to potential vaccine-induced T cell epitopes. These included: (1) HLA

 binding escape; (2) indel binding escape; (3) relative HLA binding escape; (4) K-mer scan; 
and (5) local PCP.
3. Results
To analyze sieve effects exerted by the MrkAd5 subtype B vaccine tested in South Africa, an 
HIV-1 subtype C epidemic region, we used a similar approach as the Step Study sieve 
analysis [4].
3.1. Sieve analysis sequence dataset
At the time the study was initiated, 62 individuals had acquired HIV-1 [8] of whom 43 (20 
placebo and 23 vaccine) were selected for sequencing (Table 1). Samples from the first 
HIV-1-positive visit were sequenced and participants were included based on time from 
diagnosis, number of vaccinations, and time from vaccination (Table 1). 277 near-full-length 
HIV sequences were generated, with the mean number for each participant in the placebo 
and vaccine groups of 6.89 (range 5–12) and 6.00 (range 2–12), respectively (Fig. 1). Forty 
individuals were infected with subtype C, while one subtype A1 and one C/A recombinant 
infections were identified in vaccine recipients, and one C/B recombinant infection was 
identified in a placebo recipient. Both recombinant viruses were subtype C in the gene 
regions matched to the vaccine, with evidence of non-C sequences predominantly occurring 
in Env. Unless mentioned specifically, we included the sequences from all 43 participants in 
these analyses.
3.2. Founder analysis
To determine whether the vaccine affected the transmission bottleneck, we analyzed genetic 
complexity of viruses from 41 individuals with five or more sequences. Thirty-three 
participants harbored homogenous viral populations, and 8 participants were infected with 
heterogeneous viral populations (Table 1, Fig. 1). We found no discernible difference in the 
ratio of homogeneous to heterogeneous viral populations establishing infection across 
treatment arms, with 17/21 (81%) homogeneous infections in the vaccine arm compared to 
16/20 (80%) in the placebo arm. One participants’ envelope sequences clustered separately 
on phylogenetic trees, suggesting infection with two distinct viral strains (Fig. S1).
3.3. Evidence of global sieve effects in Gag and Nef proteins
Computing the protein mismatch distance of each breakthrough infecting sequence to the 
vaccine insert across treatment groups using Hamming distance analysis, we found 
statistically significant evidence that viruses in the vaccine arm were more distant from the 
vaccine insert for both Gag and Nef (Fig. 2; p = 0.045 and 0.021 respectively). Using 
methods that compare the distribution of distances between vaccine and placebo recipients 
directly, and do not make use of the vaccine insert sequence, we also found significant 
differences for Gag using the Global PCP method (p = 0.037), and for Nef using both Global 
PCP and QEMD methods (0.032 and 0.030 respectively). We found no evidence for 
treatment-associated differences using phylogenetic distance methods (Table S2).

 3.4. No evidence of CD8+ T cell-specific vaccine-induced pressure
Applying the same sieve analysis methods used for the Step Study, as well as novel methods 
that consider predicted HLA-binding escape via amino-acid substitutions and insertions/
deletions [3], we identified no evidence of CD8-mediated sieve effects at a whole protein 
level, nor at the individual epitope level (Table S3). We also used the “k-mer scan” and the 
“local PCP” methods to compare 9-mers between vaccine and breakthrough sequences and 
found no statistically significant evidence of a sieve effect at any 9-mer after adjusting the p-
values to control the false discovery rate at 20% (Table S4).
3.5. Local sieve analyses identified putative sites of vaccine-induced pressure
We applied similar statistical approaches to examine differences in individual amino acid 
sites or short k-mers as those previously reported in both the Step [4] and RV144 trials 
[2,20]. We employed four site-specific local sieve analysis methods. All sites with an 
unadjusted two-sided p-value <0.05 by any of the four site-specific methods were considered 
a putative “signature site”. False discovery rate q-values were computed for each protein 
separately.
Twenty-seven putative signature sites were identified (Fig. 3a, b and Table 2). Twenty (74%) 
were classified as typical “vMatch” sieve effects as there was a larger fraction of vaccine-
matched amino acids among placebo recipients compared to vaccine recipients, consistent 
with the hypothesis that there is selection against vaccine-matched viruses by vaccine-
induced immune responses. Seven (26%) were classified as atypical “vMismatch” sieve 
effects, as there was a larger fraction of vaccine-matched amino acids among vaccine 
recipients compared to placebo recipients. In sequence data without a true sieve effect, we 
would falsely identify about 5% of all sites as signature sites (using p < 0.05) and we would 
expect that the frequency of vMatch and vMismatch effects would be equal. Under this 
assumption of equal occurrence and using a two-tailed exact binomial test, the probability of 
observing such a high proportion of vMatch signature sites as we did here (74%) is 0.019. 
The corresponding probabilities for the individual proteins Gag, Pol and Nef are 0.021, 1.0, 
and 0.34, respectively. Under a model that most true vaccine signature site sieve effects are 
expected to be of the vMatch type, this result strengthens the evidence against the null 
hypothesis of no sieve effects and favors the finding of sieve effects at some of the amino 
acid sites. However, due in part to the large number of sites that were tested and the 
relatively small number of participants that were sequenced (n = 43), none of these 27 
putative signature sites were found to be statistically significant after the p-values were 
adjusted to control the false-discovery rate at 20%.
To determine if there were similarities between the signature sites identified in Step and 
Phambili we plotted the treatment difference in the percent of vaccine-mismatched residues 
(vaccine minus placebo) for all sites in Gag, Pol and Nef for the two studies and annotated 
the Phambili signature sites (Figs. 4 and S3). There was no evidence that there was an 
overlap of signature sites between the two studies.

 3.6. Factors that may contribute to lower signal in Phambili compared to Step
The signal identified in Phambili was statistically weaker than identified in Step, and we 
performed a sensitivity analysis to investigate whether Phambili's smaller sample size (43 vs. 
65 Step) rendered it underpowered to detect a sieve signal of similar magnitude. Using Step 
sequences, for 1000 iterations, we simulated the Phambili sample-size conditions by 
randomly selecting 23 of the infected vaccine recipients and 20 of the infected placebo 
recipients, and for each iteration we performed the site-specific sieve analysis on all three 
insert proteins using the GWJ and MBS methods. Gag 84 survived multiplicity adjustment 
(q < 0.2 and Holm-Bonferroni adjusted p < 0.05) and was highly significant (p < 0.001) for 
both methods in every iteration and was the only site in all three insert proteins to survive 
multiplicity adjustment.
We then investigated the influence of host HLA alleles and found differences in the 
distributions of the participants’ HLA alleles (Fig. S2), including a large difference in the 
frequency of HLA A*02. While in Step there was evidence of a sieve effect when CTL 
epitopes were predicted on the vaccine insert and compared to HLA relevant regions on the 
viral proteins, no such effect was found for Phambili (Fig. 5a–c). However, this signal lost 
significance when A*02:01 epitopes were removed, suggesting that the lower frequency of 
A*02 alleles among Phambili participants would by itself be sufficient to lead to different 
vaccine-induced epitopes and lower CD8 T cell pressure.
Lately, we investigated the potential impact of genetic distance between the vaccine insert 
and circulating viruses based on placebo recipient sequences. The average mismatch 
between the vaccine and breakthrough viruses in Phambili of 15.3%, 7.6% and 24.9% for 
Gag, Pol and Nef, respectively, was considerably higher than what was observed for Step 
(6.7%, 5.4% and 19.1%). As peptides containing more than three mismatches typically lack 
cross-reactive activity [21], we then compared the 9-mer coverage of the MrkAd5 vaccine 
by computing the percentage of 9-mers that were exact matches to the vaccine inserts. While 
the coverage of the vaccine against the Phambili subtype-C viruses was 31%, 46% and 14% 
for Gag, Pol and Nef, respectively, the same analysis repeated against subtype B Step 
sequences gave coverage of 56%, 61% and 26%, respectively (Fig. 5d).
4. Discussion
We conducted a sequence analysis of breakthrough infections in the Phambili HIV-1 vaccine 
trial to detect and characterize vaccine-induced immune pressure. We found evidence for 
global sieve effects in Gag and Nef which were robust to three different methods for 
computing a genetic distance, suggesting that the result does not depend on a specific 
definition of sequence similarity. Evidence of vaccine pressure in Gag has now been found 
across three different HIV-1 efficacy studies (Step, Phambili and RV144), although by 
different methods.
We identified 27 putative amino acid signature sites that differed between vaccine and 
placebo recipients, many of which were located in positions associated with CD8 T cell 
pressure in natural infection (Table S5). None of these remained statistically signifi-cant 
following multiplicity adjustment, which is different from the Step study which identified a

 robust signature at Gag 84, a site encompassed by several documented T cell epitopes [4]. 
Differences in host genetics may have reduced our ability to detect vaccine effects in 
Phambili. The high frequency of the A*02 alleles in Step, for example, was a strong 
contributor of the ability to detect the Gag 84 signature site, and we found that differences in 
the frequency of this allele would by itself be sufficient to lead to different vaccine-induced 
epitopes and lower CD8 T cell pressure.
Incomplete vaccination or the high genetic distance between the vaccine and the 
breakthrough infections may have also contributed to weaker signal seen in Phambili. While 
38 of the 65 (58%) Step Study infected participants analyzed completed their three-
immunization vaccination schedules, none of the participants in the Phambili sieve analysis 
received a complete vaccination course. The frequency of responses, however, was similar in 
both trials, with T cell responses in more than three-quarters of participants [4,8,7]. A 
subtype effect however was observed in Phambili, where more participants developed an 
interferon-γ-secreting T cell response to clade B peptides (89%) than to clade C peptides 
(77%), and the overall magnitude of response to the subtype B vaccine-matched panel was 
significantly higher than to the subtype C potential T cell epitope panel (p < 0.0001) [8]. 
Given these results, it is reasonable to expect that participants in this study would exhibit a 
less-effective vaccine response than would participants in Step. This further suggests the 
importance of matching the vaccine immunogens to the circulating HIV-1s in the geographic 
region(s) of an efficacy trial.
Recent advances in the sieve analysis field have provided a variety of methods, for detecting 
specific types of sieve effects [2]. The global and local sieve effects detected in Step, RV144 
and Phambili were identified using different methods, which were not always in agreement 
with one another. This suggests that additional research is required to study the differences 
between the methods. We suggest that methods need to be compared predominantly on point 
estimates of vaccine efficacy (VE) (comparing the estimated VE against matched HIV 
strains to the estimated VE against mismatched HIV strains), rather than by comparing p-
values for sieve effects. This is due to the fact that it is easy for one method to give a 
borderline significant sieve effect p-value (or q-value), and for another to give a borderline 
insignificant sieve effect p-value (or q-value), but show no meaningful difference in the 
results on the interpretable estimated VE scale.
In conclusion, we present evidence of global sieve effects in Gag and Nef, and local sieve 
effects at amino acid sites. However, the effects are only moderate in nature, and while they 
suggest that the MRKAd5 HIV-1 Gag/Pol/Nef vaccine induced immune pressure on 
breakthrough infections in the Phambili trial, their status as false discoveries cannot be ruled 
out. We propose that the mismatch between the vaccine and infecting subtype, together with 
differences in HLA distribution reduced our ability to detect vaccine sieve effects in the 
Phambili study. Smaller sample size and lack of complete vaccination schedule may also 
have contributed. Sieve analyses and immune measures are our most important tools for 
understanding the immune response to vaccination and this study illustrates the importance 
that host genetics and vaccine insert clade mismatch can have on vaccine effects.

Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of 277 gag nucleotide sequences from 43 
participants. Tree comprises sequences from 43 individuals: 40 were infected with subtype-
C viruses, and 3 with non-subtype-C viruses (C/A and C/B recombinants and a subtype A1). 
For reference, subtype-B strains CAM_01 (the gag gene included in the MRK-Ad5 vaccine) 
and HXB2 were included. Terminal branches in blue indicate placebo-recipient sequences 
and those in red vaccine-recipient sequences. Gray boxes denote individuals with 
heterogeneous infections. Internal branches with node support >80% are indicated with

Hamming distances between vaccine insert sequences and breakthrough virus sequences. 
Distances between the vaccine immunogen and each breakthrough virus was computed with 
distance for each participant measured as the fraction of amino acid residues in their 
majority founder consensus sequence that mismatched the aligned vaccine insert sequence. 
Distance was computed separately for each participant (gray circles) and for each protein 
encoded by the vaccine: Gag (Panel A), Pol (Panel B), Nef (Panel C). Boxes indicate the 
median and inter-quartile range (IQR) of the distances for each treatment group with 
whiskers indicating the range of the distances within 1.5 times the IQR. One Pol sequence 
was removed as it was incomplete. Treatment groups were compared using a pooled-
variance t-statistic. Statistical significance was determined by calculating two-sided p-values 
using a permutation test on the treatment labels.

 GWJ method, which is a t-statistic comparing substitution weights across treatment groups. 
The black dashed horizontal lines in the middle of the gene and protein regions indicate the 
zero-point for the test statistic, so the farther away the point is from the center line, the more 
significant it was observed to be with this method. Points above the dashed line indicate that 
a site was found to have a “vMatch” sieve effect (greater frequency of vaccine-mismatched 
residues in vaccine than placebo viruses), while points below the dashed line indicate 
“vMismatch” signature sites (greater frequency of vaccine-mismatched residues in placebo 
than vaccine viruses). (b) Signature site amino acid distributions. All sites with evidence for 
a different amino acid distribution in vaccine versus placebo sequences relative to a 
reference residue (unadjusted p < 0.05) by any of the site-scanning methods (DVE, GWJ, 
MBS or local PCP) in the vaccine immunogen are shown. For each identified signature site, 
the distributions of amino acids from the vaccine and placebo recipients’ sequences are 
shown relative to the insert's amino acid. Each participant is represented by a bar of equal 
height. Within a bar, colors depict the fraction of the participant's sequences with that amino 
acid residue (or insertion or deletion, indicated by a “–”). The vaccine sequence amino acid 
residue, in black, is shown above the midline while vaccine-mismatched residues are shown 
below the midline. The widths of the bars are scaled so that the total width of the vaccine-
recipient part of the plot is the same as for the placebo-recipient part.

 Fig. 4. 
Comparison of putative site-specific sieve effects observed in the Step and Phambili Studies. 
The magnitude of a site-specific sieve effect can be computed as the treatment difference in 
the percent of vaccine-mismatched breakthrough viruses at each site (vaccine minus 
placebo). A positive and larger difference indicated a “vMatch” sieve effect (greater 
frequency of vaccine-mismatched residues in vaccine than placebo viruses). Scatter plots 
compare the difference computed at each site (gray dot) for the Step (x-axis) and Phambili 
(y-axis) trials and for each protein encoded by the vaccine insert: Gag (A), Pol (B) and Nef 
(C). The differences are comparable despite the difference in the number of infections that 
were included in the sieve analysis for each trial (Step: n = 65; Phambili: n = 43). If a site-
specific sieve effect from Step was replicated it would appear in the upper right or lower left 
quadrant. Sites in the upper left and lower right reflect possible sieve effects in one study, 
but not the other. The symmetric cloud of sites towards the origin is expected since the 
magnitude of the sieve effect at most sites reflects the lack of a sieve effect and noise in the 
data. Only the sieve effect at Gag 84 in the Step Study reached statistical significance after 
adjustment for multiple comparisons. Signature sites in the Phambili Study are annotated 
with the site numbers.

T cell-mediated sieve analyses on (a) Phambili (n = 42, subtype A virus excluded) and (b) 
Step (n = 64) Gag sequences. (c) Gag Step sieve analysis, excluding HLA-A*02:01 
restricted epitopes. Mean (per participant) epitope similarity to vaccine insert in Gag is 
illustrated. Epitopes were predicted on the vaccine insert by accepting a peptide region as an 
epitope if it had at least 70% similarity to an epitope listed in the Los Alamos HIV database 
(http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/content/immunology/tables/tables.html) for all epitopes and 
optimal (A-list) CTL epitopes. The similarity scores between the predicted epitopes on the 
vaccine insert and corresponding sites on the participant sequences were calculated using the 
HIV-between amino acid similarity scoring matrix. Matches were restricted to epitopes that 
are presented by each individual's specific HLA genotypes. (d) Mean 9-mer MrkAd5 
vaccine epitope coverage of sequences from the Phambili trial (n = 43) (40 subtype C, 1 A, 1 
CB, and 1 CA recombinant) and subtype-B sequences originating from the Step Study (n = 
65). Coverage was estimated by sliding a 9-mer window position-by-position through the 
proteome of Gag, Pol and Nef. Potential coverage of the vaccine was calculated as the mean 
fraction of all 9-mer peptides in the MrkAd5 vaccine sequence that was shared with the 
participant in the vaccine and placebo group sequence, without regard to HLA. Match
