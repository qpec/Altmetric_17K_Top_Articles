Abstract Precise coordination of synaptic connections ensures proper information flow within
circuits. The activity of presynaptic organizing molecules signaling to downstream pathways is
essential for such coordination, though such entities remain incompletely known. We show that
LRP4, a conserved transmembrane protein known for its postsynaptic roles, functions
presynaptically as an organizing molecule. In the Drosophila brain, LRP4 localizes to the nerve
terminals at or near active zones. Loss of presynaptic LRP4 reduces excitatory (not inhibitory)
synapse number, impairs active zone architecture, and abolishes olfactory attraction - the latter of
which can be suppressed by reducing presynaptic GABAB receptors. LRP4 overexpression
increases synapse number in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, suggesting an instructive role and a
common downstream synapse addition pathway. Mechanistically, LRP4 functions via the conserved
kinase SRPK79D to ensure normal synapse number and behavior. This highlights a presynaptic
function for LRP4, enabling deeper understanding of how synapse organization is coordinated.

Introduction
Multiple levels of synaptic organization ensure accurate, controlled information flow through neuro-
nal circuits. Neurons must first make an appropriate number of synaptic connections with their post-
synaptic partners. Each of these synaptic connections must have appropriate strength that can be
modified by plasticity and homeostasis as a result of experience and activity changes. Further, there
must be an appropriate balance between excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Finally, recent work has
shown that these connections also occupy precise locations with regards to the three-dimensional
structure of the synaptic neuropil. Indeed, circuit models for diverse neuronal ensembles fail to reca-
pitulate functional patterns unless these aspects are accounted for (Kim et al., 2014; Vlasits et al.,
2016). The misregulation of any one of these organizational parameters can result in neurodevelop-
mental
disorders
and

disabilities
like
autism
(Mullins
et
al.,
2016),
epilepsy
(Bonansco and Fuenzalida, 2016), and other synaptopathies (Grant, 2012). Revealing the molecular
mechanisms that ensure all of these facets are achieved is a critical step in understanding circuit
assembly and function.
Synaptic organizers like Neurexins / Neuroligins, Teneurins, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs),
leucine rich repeat transmembrane proteins (LRRTMs), and Ephrin / Eph receptors, among others,
ensure the proper number, distribution, and function of synaptic connections (Hruska and Dalva,
2012; Mosca, 2015; Siddiqui and Craig, 2011; Su
¨dhof, 2008; Takahashi and Craig, 2013; de Wit
and Ghosh, 2016). Loss-of-function mutations in these key synaptogenic molecules have deleterious
structural, functional, and organizational consequences for synapses and circuits. At the vertebrate

 neuromuscular junction, one of these critical organizers is LRP4. There, it forms a receptor complex
with MuSK in muscle fibers to promote clustering of acetylcholine receptors in response to motoneu-
ron-derived agrin (Zhang et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2008; Weatherbee et al., 2006). Muscle LRP4
can also function as a retrograde signal with an unknown motoneuron receptor to regulate presyn-
aptic differentiation (Yumoto et al., 2012). In these roles, the known functions from LRP4 are over-
whelmingly postsynaptic. However, a number of lines of evidence suggest a broader role, beyond
postsynaptic, for LRP4. First, motoneuron-derived LRP4 can regulate presynaptic differentiation,
demonstrating a role for neuronal LRP4 (Wu et al., 2012). Second, in the vertebrate central nervous
system (CNS), agrin is not essential for synapse formation (Daniels, 2012) though LRP4 can regulate
synaptic plasticity, development, and cognitive function (Gomez et al., 2014; Pohlkamp et al.,
2015), through functioning in astrocytes in some cases (Sun et al., 2016). In this vein, the Drosophila
genome contains an LRP4 homologue, but no clear agrin or MuSK homologues (Adams et al.,
2000), so any role for LRP4 there must be agrin-independent.
Here, we show in the Drosophila CNS that LRP4 is a presynaptic protein that regulates the num-
ber, architecture, and function of synapses. LRP4 functions largely through the conserved, presynap-
tic SR-protein kinase, SRPK79D. LRP4 and SRPK79D interact genetically and epistatically, as
SRPK79D overexpression can suppress lrp4-related phenotypes. Unexpectedly, this role for LRP4
occurs preferentially in excitatory neurons, as impairing lrp4 in inhibitory neurons has no effect. As
little is known about the presynaptic determinants (save neurotransmitter-related enzymes and trans-
porters) of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses, this may suggest a new mode for distinguishing
such synapses from the presynaptic side. Thus, LRP4 may represent a conserved synaptic organizer
that functions presynaptically, cell autonomously, and independently of agrin to coordinate synapse
number and function.
eLife digest The connections between nerve cells, called synapses, often malfunction in disease,
injury and during aging, and to understand how this happens we first need to know how they work
normally. At a synapse, one nerve cell sends a signal to the other. The signal is a chemical
substance, which binds to specialized proteins called receptors on the receiving nerve cell. At
excitatory synapses, the chemical signal activates the receiver; at inhibitory synapses, it does the
opposite. Communication at synapses typically only goes in one direction because the sender and
receiver at a synapse are not interchangeable; they contain different molecules that support their
distinct roles.
To complicate matters, the same molecule may sometimes be present on both sides of a synapse
with a different role in each. Moreover, not all synapses exist between two nerve cells; some
synapses also form between nerve cells and muscle fibers to control the movement of the muscles.
Mosca et al. set out to identify new players involved in forming synapses, and to identify differences
in the formation of nerve cell-to-nerve cell versus nerve cell-to-muscle connections.
Mosca et al. were interested in particular in a protein called LRP4. In mammals, LRP4 is largely
present on the muscle side of nerve cell-to-muscle synapses, where it acts as a receptor for a
chemical signal called Agrin. However, fruit flies — which lack Agrin – also possess the gene for
LRP4, suggesting that it has other roles too. Mosca et al. now show that LRP4 is present in the nerve
cell-to-nerve cell synapses found in the fruit fly’s brain. Further experiments reveal that fruit fly LRP4
plays an important role on the sender side of these synapses. Reducing the amount of LRP4 in the
fruit fly brain reduces the number of excitatory, but not inhibitory, synapses. This suggests that fruit
fly LRP4 may help regulate the formation of excitatory synapses.
Understanding how synapses form, and the differences between excitatory and inhibitory
connections, could provide new insights into disorders of impaired synapse formation such as
schizophrenia. LRP4 has also been implicated in disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) and myasthenia gravis, in which impaired communication between nerves and muscles causes
muscles to weaken. Improved understanding of how synapses work may lead to better drugs to
treat these disorders.

 Results
LRP4 is a synaptic protein expressed in excitatory neurons
We identified CG8909 as the fly LRP4 homologue (Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2A), which
is predicted to be a single-pass transmembrane protein whose domain organization resembles that
of mammalian LRP4 (Figure 1A). Drosophila LRP4 shares 38% identity with human LRP4 overall, 61%
identity within the LDL-repeat containing extracellular portion, and 28% identity in the intracellular
tail. Consistent with previous expression data from whole-brain microarrays (Chintapalli et al.,
2007), we determined that LRP4 was expressed throughout the adult brain using antibodies against
the endogenous protein (Figure 1B–C) or an lrp4-GAL4 transgene that expresses GAL4 under the
lrp4 promoter and visualized with either Syt-HA (Figure 1D) or an HA epitope-tagged LRP4 (Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 2C). All methods revealed similar patterns of expression in the antennal
lobes (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–E), optic lobes, and higher olfactory centers
including the mushroom body and the lateral horn (Figure 1B,D). Antibody specificity was validated
by the complete loss of signal in a deletion (see below) of the lrp4 coding region (Figure 1C). We
further investigated LRP4 in the antennal lobe, the first olfactory processing center in the Drosophila
CNS, which has emerged as a model circuit for studying sensory processing (Wilson, 2013) and
whose synaptic organization was recently mapped at high resolution (Mosca and Luo, 2014).
LRP4 was enriched in the synaptic neuropil of the antennal lobe (Figure 1B). As this neuropil is
made up of processes from multiple classes of olfactory neurons, all of which make presynaptic con-
nections there, we used intersectional strategies with lrp4-GAL4 to identify which neurons expressed
lrp4. These approaches revealed lrp4 expression in both olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs; Fig-
ure 1—figure supplement 2D) and projection neurons (PNs; Figure 1—figure supplement 2E).
Because of the observed neuropil expression of LRP4 (Figure 1B–C), we sought to examine the
localization of LRP4 with regards to a known synaptic protein, the active zone scaffolding component
Bruchpilot (Wagh et al., 2006). However, due to the density of CNS neuropil, colocalization analyses
using light level microscopy have inherently low resolution. Therefore, we applied expansion micros-
copy (Chen et al., 2015) to the Drosophila CNS to improve the resolution of colocalization analysis.
This technique uses isotropic expansion of immunolabeled tissue (Tillberg et al., 2016) while main-
taining the spatial relationship between protein targets and allowing for enhanced resolution with
confocal
microscopy.
Using

(proExM),
we
obtained
reliable, ~4 fold isotropic expansion of Drosophila CNS tissue (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). To
specifically examine the relationship between LRP4 and active zones only in ORNs, we expressed
HA-tagged LRP4 and Brp-Short-mStraw using the pebbled-GAL4 driver (Sweeney et al., 2007).
LRP4-HA expressed using lrp4-GAL4 localizes to similar regions as LRP4 antibody staining
(Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2C), suggesting the fidelity of this transgene. Within
individual expanded glomeruli of proExM-treated brains, LRP4 and Brp localized to similar regions
(Figure 1E) and, when examined at high magnification, LRP4 localized either coincidentally with Brp
(Figure 1F, arrowhead) or to the space adjacent to active zones (Figure 1F, arrow). This combination
of active zone and periactive zone localization is similar to that of known synaptic organizers
(Jepson et al., 2014; Li et al., 2007; Mosca et al., 2012). Thus, LRP4 is a synaptic protein that local-
izes to nerve terminals.
Given widespread expression throughout the brain, we sought to identify the cell types that
express LRP4. To accomplish this, we used lrp4-GAL4 driven mCD8-GFP as this approach, in addi-
tion to labeling similar neuropil regions as the antibody, also highlighted the cell bodies of lrp4-posi-
tive cells. We co-stained brains for various cellular and neuronal-subtype markers and quantified the
overlap between cells positive for lrp4-expression and expression of these various labels. Nearly all
lrp4-positive cells observed (99.5%) expressed the neuronal marker ELAV (Robinow and White,
1988) (Figure 1G), indicating that these cells were neurons. Few (0.4%) expressed the glial marker
Repo (Xiong et al., 1994) (Figure 1H). The majority of lrp4-positive cells (59.1%) also expressed
choline acetyltransferase (ChAT; Figure 1I), a marker for cholinergic excitatory neurons. We also
observed partial overlap between lrp4-positive neurons and vGlut (22.4%; Figure 1J), the vesicular
transporter for glutamate. In the fly brain, glutamatergic neurons can be either excitatory or inhibi-
tory (Liu and Wilson, 2013). Interestingly, there was little overlap (0.3%) between lrp4 and GABA,
the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in Drosophila (Figure 1K). Thus, LRP4 is expressed at synaptic

may be excitatory or inhibitory, but is excluded from inhibitory GABAergic neurons.
Perturbing presynaptic LRP4 changes ORN synapse number
As both the expression and localization of LRP4 were consistent with the protein serving a synaptic
role, we sought to determine whether disrupting its function in excitatory neurons would affect syn-
apse number. To image these connections, we expressed fluorescently tagged synaptic markers
(Fouquet et al., 2009; Leiss et al., 2009; Mosca and Luo, 2014) and used previously established
methods to estimate the number of active zones and postsynaptic receptor puncta (Mosca and Luo,
2014) in olfactory neurons in antennal lobe glomeruli (Figure 2A). These methods show stereotyped
active zone numbers and densities in ORNs and can reveal the function of synaptic proteins in medi-
ating these aspects (Mosca and Luo, 2014). Further, measurements from these methods are consis-
tent with our own electron microscopy (Mosca and Luo, 2014) as well as results from ultrastructural
reconstructions of all synapses in individual glomeruli (Tobin et al., 2017) demonstrating their utility.
To perturb LRP4 function, we created a null mutation (lrp4dalek) using the CRISPR-Cas9 system
(Gratz et al., 2013) that removed the entire coding region (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B).
lrp4dalek mutants were viable with a slightly reduced body size.
In ORN axon terminals projecting to the VA1v glomerulus in males (Figure 2B), lrp4dalek mutants
(Figure 2C,H) showed a 31% reduction in the number of puncta for Brp-Short, an active zone
marker, compared to control adults (Figure 2B,H). This phenotype was recapitulated when we
expressed any of four independent transgenic RNAi constructs against lrp4 only in ORNs
(Figure 2D,H, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1), demonstrating that LRP4 functions presynapti-
cally in regulating active zone number. These changes were independent of glomerular volume: lrp4
loss-of-function had no effect on neurite volume (Figure 2H and Figure 2—figure supplement 1).
Though the intensity of Brp-Short puncta across some genotypes trended slightly downward, it did
not reach statistical significance (data not shown). We also observed that lrp4 disruption (using
lrp4dalek mutants and presynaptic RNAi expression) caused a quantitatively similar reduction of active
zone numbers in VA1v ORN axon terminals in females in this sexually dimorphic glomerulus (Fig-
ure 2—figure supplement 2), and in ORN axon terminals projecting to the VA1d, DA1, DL4, and
DM6 glomeruli (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). This suggests that lrp4 phenotypes are not spe-
cific to particular glomeruli. Beyond Brp-Short, we observed similar phenotypes with an independent
presynaptic marker, DSyd-1 (Owald et al., 2012), that is also punctate at ORN terminals
(Mosca and Luo, 2014) (Figure 2—figure supplement 4).
We further examined the consequences of lrp4 disruption on the number of Da7 acetylcholine
receptor puncta in PN dendrites postsynaptic to the ORN axon terminals imaged above. Loss of lrp4
decreased Da7-EGFP puncta numbers by 29% compared to controls (Figure 2F–G,I). This deficit
was also independent of neurite volume (Figure 2I and Figure 2—figure supplement 2), again dem-
onstrating that lrp4 perturbation phenotypes did not result from decreased neuronal projection size.
Further, both the presynaptic active zone and postsynaptic acetylcholine receptor phenotypes were
quantitatively similar. While likely that the postsynaptic AChR number decreases concomitantly with

lrp4-positive cells are largely excitatory neurons. The percentage of GFP-positive cells that are ALSO positive for the cell-type specific marker are as
follows: Elav = 99.50 ± 0.19% overlap; Repo = 0.38 ± 0.18% overlap; ChAT = 59.13 ± 2.48% overlap; vGlut = 22.38 ± 1.28% overlap; GABA = 0.25 ±

 the presynaptic active zone number (which is controlled by presynaptic LRP4), we cannot exclude an
additional postsynaptic role for LRP4 (see Discussion). However, it is evident that the loss of LRP4
reduces synapse number as assayed both pre- and postsynaptically.
The above experiments demonstrated the necessity of presynaptic LRP4 in ensuring the proper
number of synaptic connections. However, with known presynaptic organizers like Neurexin, overex-
pression results in added boutons (Li et al., 2007) and active zones (Craig and Kang, 2007). To test
for LRP4 sufficiency in synapse addition, we overexpressed HA-tagged LRP4 presynaptically in other-
wise wild-type ORNs. LRP4 overexpression increased the number of Brp-Short puncta by 30%
(Figure 2E,H, and Figure 2—figure supplement 2); this increase was also independent of neurite
volume (Figure 2h and Figure 2—figure supplements 2–3) as the glomeruli remained the same
size. Thus, there is a direct relationship between presynaptic LRP4 expression and synapse number
in excitatory neurons: removing LRP4 reduces, while overexpressing LRP4 increases, synapse
number.
Ultrastructural analysis reveals LRP4 regulates active zone number and
structure
Though light level analyses accurately report fold-changes in synapse number (Chen et al., 2014;
Mosca and Luo, 2014), we sought to independently confirm and extend our analyses using electron
microscopy. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on the fly antennal lobe, we quantified
synapse number in putative ORN terminals based on morphology (Rybak et al., 2016; Tobin et al.,
2017) in both control (Figure 3A) and lrp4dalek (Figure 3B) adult brains. T-bar profiles were evident
in both genotypes, but were reduced in number by 31% in mutant terminals (Figure 3C), which
exactly matched the reduction observed by Brp-Short puncta measurements (Figure 2H). Terminal
perimeter was slightly but significantly increased in lrp4dalek terminals (Figure 3D), resulting in a 36%
reduction in T-bar density when compared to control (Figure 3E). These results are consistent with
those observed via confocal microscopy, and demonstrate that LRP4 is necessary for the proper
number of synapses in putative ORN terminals of the antennal lobe.
Brp-Short assays alone cannot distinguish between normal and impaired active zones. We there-
fore examined the ultrastructural morphology of individual active zones to determine if LRP4 had an
additional role in the biogenesis of the T-bar itself. In both control (Figure 3F–H) and lrp4
(Figure 3I–K) terminals, we observed single (Figure 3F–I), double (Figure 3G,J), and triple T-bars
(Figure 3H,K) suggesting that LRP4 is not absolutely required for T-bar formation and some ele-
ments of organization. However, whereas irregular T-bars in control animals were rare (<5% of total
T-bars), the majority of T-bars in lrp4 mutants displayed one or more defects (Figure 3L–Q), includ-
ing immature T-bars that lacked tops (Figure 3L), detached T-bars (Figure 3M), misshapen T-bars of
varying configurations and aggregations (Figure 3N–P), and multiple T-bars beyond those observed

 in control animals (Figure 3Q). Thus, in addition to controlling the number of synapses, LRP4 is also
required for individual active zones to assume normal morphology, attach to the membrane, and
have proper spacing. Thus, LRP4 has multiple, critical roles in central synapse formation.
LRP4 is not required for inhibitory neuron synapse number
The preferential expression of lrp4 in excitatory but not inhibitory neurons (Figure 1) suggests that it
promotes synapse addition specifically in excitatory neurons. To test this, we used Brp-Short to
examine synapse number in GABAergic inhibitory neurons projecting to the antennal lobe using the
GAD1-GAL4 driver (Ng et al., 2002). Though GAD1-positive neurons project throughout the anten-
nal lobe (Mehren and Griffith, 2006), we restricted our analyses to the DA1 glomerulus, where we
observed reductions in excitatory synapses (Figure 2—figure supplements 3–4) following LRP4 dis-
ruption. When LRP4 function was impaired using the lrp4dalek mutant or RNAi in these neurons, syn-
apse number was unaffected (Figure 4A–B,D). Thus, the reduction of synapse number under LRP4
loss-of-function conditions appeared specific for excitatory neurons.
Interestingly, when LRP4 was overexpressed in inhibitory neurons, we observed a 35% increase in
synapse number without an accompanying change in neurite volume, similar to what we observed
for excitatory neurons (Figure 4C–D). This suggests that, while inhibitory GABAergic neurons do not
normally utilize LRP4 to regulate synapse number, they possess the downstream machinery neces-
sary for LRP4 to function in adding synapses. Thus, when LRP4 is exogenously expressed in these
cells, it can co-opt this machinery for synapse addition. As such, excitatory and inhibitory neurons
likely use distinct cell surface synaptic organizers (LRP4 for excitatory neurons) that converge on
common mechanisms for synapse addition.
Excitatory, but not inhibitory, olfactory projection neurons also require
LRP4 to ensure proper synapse number
Though we initially restricted our analyses to the antennal lobe, we also observed lrp4 expression
throughout the brain, including two higher order olfactory neuropil: the mushroom body and the lat-
eral horn (Figure 1B–D). To determine whether LRP4 could also serve as a synaptic organizer in
these brain regions, we examined the effects of lrp4 perturbation on both excitatory and inhibitory
synapses in the lateral horn (LH, Figure 5A), a higher order olfactory center involved in innate olfac-
tory behavior (Heimbeck et al., 2001). We used Mz19-GAL4 to label projection neurons whose den-
drites and cell bodies are restricted to the antennal lobe region, but whose axon terminals make
excitatory synapses in the lateral horn (Berdnik et al., 2006). To label inhibitory synapses, we used
the Mz699-GAL4 driver, which is expressed in inhibitory projection neurons (iPNs) whose dendrites
project to the antennal lobe and whose axons project to the lateral horn (Lai et al., 2008;
Liang et al., 2013). Mz699-GAL4 also labels a small subset of third-order neurons that project den-
drites largely void of presynaptic terminals to the ventral lateral horn (Liang et al., 2013). Thus, we
consider synaptic signal labeled by Mz699-GAL4 as being contributed mostly by iPNs.
In lrp4 mutants, the number of excitatory lateral horn synapses was reduced by 40%, consistent
with a role for LRP4 in synapse formation (Figure 5B–C,F). PN perturbation of lrp4 using RNAi
reduced synapse number similarly to the loss-of-function allele, demonstrating a presynaptic role for
lrp4 in these neurons (Figure 5F and Figure 5—figure supplement 1). These changes were inde-
pendent of neurite volume, which remained unaffected (Figure 5F). Perturbation of lrp4 in Mz699-

 positive iPNs, however, had no effect on the number of synapses (Figure 5D–E,G, and Figure 5—
figure supplement 1) despite a slight reduction in neurite volume in lrp4dalek mutants (Figure 5G).
Despite a lack of a loss-of-function phenotype, we observed an increase in synapse number when we
overexpressed LRP4-HA in Mz699-positive neurons (Figure 5G and Figure 5—figure supplement
1). Thus, the results of lrp4 perturbation on excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the lateral horn
resembled those of the antennal lobe, suggesting a general role for LRP4 in promoting excitatory
synapse number.
LRP4 is required for normal olfactory attraction behavior
Given the role for LRP4 in the specific regulation of excitatory synapse number, we sought to deter-
mine whether the consequences of LRP4 disruption were accompanied by functional changes in
behavior. We examined fly attraction to the odorant in apple cider vinegar using a modified olfac-
tory trap assay (Larsson et al., 2004; Potter et al., 2010) (Figure 6A), an ethologically relevant
assay that requires flight and/or climbing to follow odorant information within a larger arena
(Min et al., 2013). As presynaptic LRP4 regulates ORN synapse number, we used RNAi against lrp4
expressed selectively in all ORNs using pebbled-GAL4 to assess olfactory attraction. Control flies
bearing a single copy of pebbled-GAL4 or one of four different lrp4 RNAi transgenes alone exhib-
ited a strong preference for apple cider vinegar (Figure 6B). Flies bearing both transgenes (and
thus, reduced lrp4 expression) exhibited a near complete abrogation of attractive behavior and were
no longer able to distinguish the attractive apple cider vinegar from a water control (Figure 6B).
Movement, wall climbing, and flight were still observed in these flies (data not shown), suggesting
that this was not due to widespread defects in motion, consistent with our selective perturbation of
LRP4 function in ORNs. Thus, presynaptic LRP4 in ORNs is necessary for normal olfactory attraction
behavior.
A complete loss of olfactory attraction was unexpected for a manipulation that reduced synapse
number by ~30%. One potential explanation is that, while the remaining 70% of synapses were
detected by the Brp-Short assay, they were functionally impaired. This would be consistent with the
myriad of morphology defects observed in lrp4 mutant T-bars via TEM (Figure 3I–Q). In Drosophila,
olfactory information flow is regulated by presynaptic inhibition by local GABAergic interneurons
onto excitatory ORNs via the GABAA and GABABR2 receptors (Olsen and Wilson, 2008;
Root et al., 2008). If the remaining synapses were indeed weakened by the loss of LRP4, reducing
inhibition onto those ORNs might suppress the behavioral phenotype. To test this hypothesis, we
inhibited the GABABR2 receptor in ORNs using RNAi, which by itself did not affect the olfactory
attraction behavior (Figure 6B). Simultaneous knockdown of GABABR2 and lrp4, however, markedly
suppressed the behavioral phenotype associated with lrp4 knockdown alone (Figure 6B). This
manipulation did not suppress the morphological phenotype, however, as the reduction in Brp-Short
puncta was still apparent (1297 ± 25.62 puncta, n = 39 antennal lobes for Or47b-GAL4 > UAS-lrp4IR2
+ UAS-mCD8-GFP vs. 1191 ± 48.91 puncta, n = 12 antennal lobes for Or47b-GAL4 > UAS-lrp4IR2 +
UAS-GABABR2IR, p>0.2). These results suggest that olfactory attraction behavior requires a proper
level of net excitatory drive in the antennal lobe circuit and that defects caused by weakened excit-
atory synapses can be compensated for by reducing inhibition.
SRPK79D interacts with, and requires, LRP4 for ORN terminal
localization
To understand how LRP4 could regulate excitatory synapse number and olfactory behavior, we
investigated the mechanism by which it functions. In examining lrp4dalek mutant larvae and larvae
where lrp4 was specifically knocked down in all neurons using RNAi, we observed impaired localiza-
tion of active zone material (Figure 7A–C). Under normal circumstances, the active zone marker

 1993) were barely detectable in larval transverse nerves (Figure 7A), due to their proper trafficking
to or maintenance at synaptic sites. However, in lrp4dalek mutants, Bruchpilot improperly accumu-
lated in the transverse nerves (Figure 7B). This kind of accumulation is rarely observed in wild type,
but is also most notably associated with loss of SRPK79D (Figure 7C), a conserved serine-arginine
protein kinase that localizes to NMJ terminals and negatively regulates premature active zone
assembly before Bruchpilot reaches the fly NMJ (Johnson et al., 2009; Nieratschker et al., 2009).
In both lrp4 and srpk79D mutants, Brp accumulation was not accompanied by focal accumulations of
Synaptotagmin I, indicating that axonal trafficking is not generally impaired (Figure 7A–C)
(Gindhart et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2009; Nieratschker et al., 2009). Because of the similarity in
the transverse nerve phenotypes and the role of SRPK79D at peripheral synapses, we hypothesized
that LRP4 and SRPK79D could operate together in the CNS to regulate synapse number.
As SRPK79D antibodies are not available, we utilized Venus-tagged SRPK79D transgenes to
examine CNS localization. When expressed only in VA1v ORNs, venus-SRPK79D localized to axon
terminals and overlapped with Brp-Short, demonstrating localization with and adjacent to CNS
active zones (Figure 7D). This was reminiscent of LRP4-HA localization in ORNs (Figure 1F) so we
turned to proExM to more precisely assess the spatial relationship between SRPK79D and LRP4. In
the ORNs of expanded individual glomeruli, LRP4-HA and venus-SRPK79D exhibited coincident and
adjacent localization (Figure 7E). However, SRPK79D was expressed more broadly throughout
ORNs, suggesting that only a subset of SRPK79D colocalizes with LRP4. This may indicate both
LRP4-dependent and -independent roles for SRPK79D. We also examined this synaptic localization
in lrp4dalek mutants: loss of lrp4 reduced synaptic SRPK79D levels by ~50% (Figure 7F–H). This
reduction was specific for SRPK79D, as the staining for other markers, like the general neuropil label
N-Cadherin, was unaffected (Figure 7F–H). These results demonstrate that LRP4 is necessary for the
proper localization and / or expression of SRPK79D and suggest that SRPK79D might act down-
stream of LRP4 to regulate synapse number.
Due to their spatial proximity, we next employed proximity ligation assays (PLA) to determine
whether LRP4 and SRPK79D are spatially close enough to interact. PLA uses oligonucleotides conju-
gated to secondary antibodies (Greenwood et al., 2015; So
¨derberg et al., 2006): if the epitopes
are sufficiently close (30–40 nm), the oligonucleotides can be ligated together and detected using a
fluorescent probe. The result can be observed using confocal microscopy and preserve, to a high
degree, the spatial localization of the proteins involved. PLA has been used to examine protein-pro-
tein interactions at the NMJ (Wang et al., 2015) but not, to our knowledge, in the CNS. To examine

 figure supplement 1A–B) or the probes are not added (Figure 7I), no PLA signal is observed. How-
ever, in the presence of both transgenes and the appropriate probes (Figure 7J and Figure 7—fig-
ure supplement 1C–D), we detected positive signal indicating that the proteins were close enough
to interact. The PLA signal represented a subset of LRP4 or SRPK79D staining patterns, suggesting
that there are roles independent of the other for each protein. Taken together, this data suggests
that LRP4 interacts with SRPK79D to maintain SRPK79D localization at the synapse.
SRPK79D overexpression suppresses LRP4 phenotypes
The interaction with, and reliance on LRP4 for synaptic SRPK79D localization suggested that the two
function together. If so, we would expect that the two would display phenotypic similarity and inter-
act in the same genetic pathway. We observed phenotypic similarity in larval nerves (Figure 7A–C),
but we further sought to study this at CNS synapses. To test the interactions between LRP4 and
SRPK79D with respect to effects of synapse number, we conducted loss-of-function, genetic interac-
tion, and genetic epistasis experiments between genetic perturbations of both. First, reducing
srpk79D function presynaptically using an established RNAi (Johnson et al., 2009) expressed in
VA1v ORNs resulted in a 15% reduction in the number of Brp-Short puncta compared to control

 (Figure 8A–B,E). Thus, SRPK79D is required for normal CNS synapse number. We further sought to
understand if LRP4 and SRPK79D interacted genetically. To examine this, we performed a transhe-
terozygote genetic interaction assay. When single copies of either lrp4 or srpk79D were removed,
there was no evident phenotype (Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–C,E). However, when one copy
of each was concurrently removed, we observed a significant reduction in Brp-Short puncta (Fig-
ure 8—figure supplement 1D–E). This suggests that the two function in the same genetic pathway
and may work together to ensure proper synapse number. Given the reduction in synaptic SRPK79D
present in lrp4 mutants, we examined whether these reduced SRPK79D levels are the root cause of
its synapse reduction. We overexpressed SRPK79D in presynaptic ORNs either in control or lrp4dalek
mutant backgrounds. Presynaptic overexpression of SRPK79D in VA1v ORNs partially suppressed
the synaptic phenotype associated with the lrp4dalek mutation, resulting in 92% of the normal num-
ber of synapses (Figure 8A,C–E), whereas overexpression of SRPK79D in a wild-type background
had no effect (Figure 8E). Finally, we sought to determine whether srpk79D was required for the
increase in Brp-Short puncta associated with LRP4 overexpression (Figure 2H). When LRP4 was over-
expressed concurrently with srpk79D RNAi, the phenotype resembled that of srpk79D RNAi alone
(Figure 8E). This suggests that LRP4 requires SRPK79D to mediate its overexpression phenotype,
likely by functioning through SRPK79D to increase the number of synapses. Combined, these indi-
cate that LRP4 and SRPK79D closely interact presynaptically in the same genetic pathway to ensure
the proper number of excitatory synapses.
In light of the synapse number defects, we also examined the functional consequences of
srpk79D perturbation on olfactory behavior. Flies expressing srpk79D RNAi in all ORNs demon-
strated a nearly complete abrogation of attraction behavior (Figure 8F) that was indistinguishable
from the lrp4 RNAi phenotype. In light of the suppression of the synapse number phenotype, we
also examined whether SRPK79D overexpression could suppress the lrp4 loss-of-function behavioral
phenotype. Control flies bearing the pan-ORN pebbled-GAL4 or the SRPK79D overexpression trans-
gene alone exhibited strong attraction towards apple cider vinegar (Figure 8F). Further, SRPK79D
overexpression in all ORNs did not affect this robust attraction. Driving both SRPK79D overexpres-
sion and lrp4 RNAi in all ORNs, however, resulted in a partial suppression of the behavioral pheno-
type associated with lrp4 RNAi (Figure 8F). As the synaptic level of SRPK79D is positively regulated
by LRP4 and SRPK79D overexpression suppresses the morphological and functional phenotypes
associated with lrp4 loss-of-function, SRPK79D is likely a key downstream effector of LRP4 in regulat-
ing synapse number and thus, normal olfactory attraction behavior.

 Discussion
Understanding how synaptic organizers regulate the number and function of synapses in the CNS is
a central goal of molecular neurobiology. This study identifies LRP4 as a synaptic protein whose
expression may be preferential for excitatory neurons in the Drosophila CNS (Figure 1). Though
well-known as the postsynaptic agrin receptor at the mouse NMJ (Kim et al., 2008; Zhang et al.,
2008), here we describe an agrin-independent, presynaptic role for LRP4. In the Drosophila CNS,
LRP4 functions presynaptically to regulate the number of active zones in presynaptic ORNs (Fig-
ures 2–3) and acetylcholine receptor clusters in the PNs postsynaptic to those ORNs (Figure 2).
Moreover, LRP4 also controls the morphology of individual active zones: lrp4 mutant T-bars exhibit
striking defects in patterning and biogenesis (Figure 3). These defects are specific for excitatory
neurons, as inhibitory neuron synapses in the antennal lobe remain unaffected (Figure 4). Overex-
pression of LRP4, however, can increase synapse number cell autonomously in both excitatory and
inhibitory neurons (Figures 2–4), suggesting that both share common mechanisms for synapse addi-
tion. The role for LRP4 further extends to higher order olfactory neuropil in the lateral horn (Fig-
ure 5), suggesting that it may serve a general role in synaptic organization. Underscoring the
functional importance of LRP4, its perturbation in excitatory ORNs abrogated olfactory attraction
behavior (Figure 6). The suppression of the behavioral phenotype by reducing presynaptic inhibition
onto ORNs further suggests that a proper level of excitatory drive is important for functional circuit
output. To mediate both morphological and behavioral effects, LRP4 likely functions through
SRPK79D, a conserved SR-protein kinase whose loss-of-function phenotypes resemble those of lrp4
(Figures 7–8), whose synaptic localization depends on LRP4 (Figure 7), who interacts genetically
with and is physically in proximity to LRP4 (Figures 7–8), and whose overexpression suppresses the
phenotypes associated with loss of lrp4 (Figure 8).
LRP4 as a synaptic regulator that distinguishes excitatory from
inhibitory presynaptic terminals
Coordination of excitation and inhibition is critical to proper circuit function. Imbalances in excitation
and inhibition lead to epileptic states (Badawy et al., 2012) and social dysfunction (Yizhar et al.,
2011), and may also underlie many autism spectrum disorders (Mullins et al., 2016; Nelson and
Valakh, 2015). The mechanisms that maintain this balance are incompletely understood, though
likely involve multiple aspects including the number of each type of neuron, their firing rates, release
probabilities, synaptic strength, and neurotransmitter receptor sensitivities. Such regulation likely
requires distinguishing excitatory from inhibitory neurons at both pre- and postsynaptic levels. Excit-
atory and inhibitory synapses are identified postsynaptically by distinct neurotransmitter receptor,
scaffolding protein, and adhesion molecule repertoires (Craig and Kang, 2007; Sheng and Kim,

complement of active zones (black T). Here, the putative ligand is depicted as having a postsynaptic PN source, but alternate sources (such as glia or
local interneurons) are also possible. In the absence of LRP4, less synaptic SRPK79D is present and active zone number is reduced. The size of the
terminal itself does not change but the synapse number (i.e., number of active zones) within that terminal space is reduced. Further, T-bar defects like a
floating T-bar can also be seen. SRPK79D overexpression in an lrp4 mutant restores synaptic SRPK79D and active zone number, despite the absence of
LRP4. Thus, the LRP4 largely functions in synaptic organization through downstream SRPK79D. ****p<0.0001; ***p<0.001; ns, not significant. Statistical

 2011; Ziv and Fisher-Lavie, 2014). Postsynaptic factors like Neuroligin 2 (Graf et al., 2004),
Gephyrin (Choii and Ko, 2015), and Slitrk3 (Takahashi et al., 2012) organize inhibitory GABAergic
synapses while LRRTMs organize excitatory synapses (Siddiqui et al., 2013; de Wit et al., 2009,
2013). Thus, postsynaptic regulation can occur by differential modulation of these factors. Little is
known, however, about the presynaptic identifiers of excitatory versus inhibitory neurons. Recent
work identified Punctin / MADD-4 as a determinant of excitatory versus inhibitory neuromuscular
synapses in C. elegans, though as a secreted factor that functions via postsynaptic interaction
(Maro et al., 2015; Pinan-Lucarre
´ et al., 2014; Tu et al., 2015). Further, Glypican4 can localize to
excitatory presynaptic terminals and interact with LRRTM4 (de Wit et al., 2013) but its synaptogenic
activity is also provided by astrocytes (Allen et al., 2012) and thus is not neuronal specific. Proteo-
mic comparisons (Biesemann et al., 2014; Boyken et al., 2013) suggest few differences beyond
those pertaining to neurotransmitter synthesis enzymes and transporters. But these components
may not be sufficient to distinguish presynaptic excitatory from inhibitory neurons. In the Drosophila
olfactory system, for example, glutamate can be inhibitory when its postsynaptic partners express
glutamate-gated chloride channels (Liu and Wilson, 2013). This suggests that pre- and postsynaptic
regulators may exist to distinguish excitatory and inhibitory synapses, though it is unclear what those
presynaptic regulators might be.
Our data suggests that LRP4 may be a candidate presynaptic organizer specific for excitatory
connections. LRP4 is expressed in a subset of excitatory cholinergic neurons, excluded from inhibi-
tory GABAergic neurons, and expressed in a subset of glutamatergic neurons that may be excitatory
or inhibitory (Figure 1). Though we cannot rule out inhibitory neuron expression in the case of the
glutamatergic subset, the phenotypes associated with LRP4 perturbation are consistent with an
excitatory neuron-specific role. Thus, LRP4 may not only serve an identifying role at excitatory synap-
ses, but also a functional one. Loss of lrp4 results in fewer excitatory synapses but has no effect on
inhibitory synapses. However, both excitatory and inhibitory neurons show increased synapse num-
ber with lrp4 overexpression (Figures 2 and 4–5). This shared competency suggests that both neu-
rons contain machinery that can be engaged downstream of LRP4 (or the cell surface) to add
synapses. Thus, proteins like LRP4 may represent identifiers of excitatory or inhibitory terminals that
function by engaging common mechanisms to add synapses.
LRP4 function across evolution
At the mouse NMJ, LRP4 is the well-established postsynaptic receptor for motoneuron-derived
Agrin
(Kim
et
al.,
2008;
Zhang
et
al.,
2008,
2011)
and
regulates
synapse
formation
(Weatherbee et al., 2006) and maintenance (Barik et al., 2014). However, additional roles for LRP4
exist at the level of the presynaptic motoneuron. A retrograde signal composed of LRP4 from the
postsynaptic muscle interacts with an unknown receptor in the motoneuron (Yumoto et al., 2012) to
regulate presynaptic differentiation. Thus, at the mouse NMJ, postsynaptic LRP4 has both cell-auton-
omous and non-cell autonomous roles. In addition, presynaptic LRP4 has been implicated to regu-
late acetylcholine receptor clustering via MMP-mediated proteolytic cleavage (Wu et al., 2012).
In the mouse CNS, LRP4 regulates synaptic physiology (Gomez et al., 2014; Pohlkamp et al.,
2015), learning and memory, fear conditioning, and CA1 spine density (Gomez et al., 2014).
Though CNS LRP4 most commonly associates with postsynaptic densities (Tian et al., 2006), it also
fractionates with synaptophysin-positive membranes (Gomez et al., 2014). Indeed, the observed
CNS phenotypes have not been localized to a particular pool of LRP4. Our identification of Drosoph-
ila LRP4 as a key player in CNS synaptogenesis, however, posits a cell-autonomous presynaptic role.
While we cannot rule out an additional, perhaps concurrent, postsynaptic role, our work is the first
to demonstrate clear cell-autonomous presynaptic functions for LRP4. Indeed, LRP4 is expressed in
PNs and may localize to PN dendrites within the antennal lobe (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). In
such a case, it could function either presynaptically, at dendrodendritic presynapses (Rybak et al.,
2016; Tobin et al., 2017) or as a postsynaptic factor. Moreover, as the Drosophila genome lacks
clear Agrin and MuSK homologs, this suggests a synaptic function of LRP4 that evolutionarily pre-
cedes Agrin and MuSK recruitment to vertebrate NMJ synaptogenesis.
It remains open whether this presynaptic function is conserved in the mammalian CNS and, if so,
what signal LRP4 receives. In Drosophila, the signal cannot be Agrin and in the mammalian CNS,
Agrin is not essential for CNS synapse formation (Daniels, 2012). Thus, the Agrin-independence of
CNS LRP4 may be conserved across systems. Moreover, our finding that LRP4 promotes excitatory,

Neuroscience
 but not inhibitory, synapse formation and function is consistent with reduced excitatory but normal
inhibitory input in hippocampal CA1 neurons of lrp4 mutant mice (Gomez et al., 2014). Moreover,
we find that LRP4 in the Drosophila CNS functions through the SR-protein kinase SRPK79D. Impaired
srpk79D function reduces synapse number and overexpression can suppress the functional and mor-
phological defects associated with lrp4 loss (Figures 7–8). This kinase is evolutionarily conserved
(Johnson et al., 2009) and the three mammalian homologues (Zhou and Fu, 2013) are widely
expressed in the mouse brain (Lein et al., 2007), including in the hippocampus. From yeast to
human, SRPKs regulate spliceosome assembly and gene expression (Zhou and Fu, 2013) but have
not been studied in mammalian synapse formation. It will be interesting to test if these kinases also
function in the mammalian CNS. Combined, however, these commonalities suggest a basic conser-
vation between invertebrate and vertebrate systems for future study.
Connecting LRP4 and human disease
Recent work implicated LRP4 in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and myasthenia gravis (MG),
two debilitating motor disorders with a worldwide prevalence of ~1/5000. Distinct ALS and MG pop-
ulations are seropositive for LRP4 autoantibodies (Tsivgoulis et al., 2014; Tzartos et al., 2014) and
double seronegative for Agrin or MuSK, suggesting that seropositivity is not a byproduct of general-
ized NMJ breakdown. Further, injection of LRP4 function-blocking antibodies into mice recapitulates
MG (Shen et al., 2013). Beyond peripheral symptoms, cognitive impairment (besides that as fronto-
temporal dementia) also occurs in a subset of ALS patients (Ringholz et al., 2005). Thus, under-
standing the roles of LRP4 in the peripheral and central nervous systems has marked clinical
significance. Our identification of an evolutionarily conserved kinase, SRPK79D, as a downstream tar-
get of LRP4 signaling may offer a window into those roles. As SRPK79D overexpression suppresses
the behavioral and the synaptic phenotypes of lrp4 loss (Figure 8), if it functions similarly in the
mammalian CNS, SRPKs could be a target for therapeutics. Further investigation of how LRP4 func-
tions in the CNS will provide new insight not only into the cognitive aspects of these debilitating
motor disorders, but also into the fundamental aspects of excitatory synapse formation.
Materials and methods
Generation of lrp4 CRISPR mutants
The lrp4 mutation was designed following published methods (Gratz et al., 2013). Two lrp4-specific
chimeric RNAs (chiRNA) were cloned into the pU6-BbsI-chiRNA vector as follows - A1, correspond-
ing to an optimal PAM site 2 bp 5’ of the start ATG (using primers: 5’ CTTCGGCGAGTTTGTGTACA
TGTC 3’ and 5’ AAACGACATGTACACAAACTCGCC 3’ with a phosphate at the 5’ end) and A2, cor-
responding to an optimal PAM site 34 bp 3’ of the TAG stop codon (using primers 5’ CTTCGAA
TCGGTAAATGGTTTCAG 3’ and 5’ AAACCTGAAACCATTTACCGATTC 3’). Both the A1 and A2
chiRNA plasmids (250 ng / mL) and a pHsp70-Cas9 plasmid (500 ng / mL) were injected into
MB03015 embryos (stock BL23835) to produce lrp4 deletions. MB03015 flies bear a Minos-based Mi
{ET1} insertion (Bellen et al., 2011) between exons 5 and 6 of the lrp4 open reading frame; adults
with the insertion are marked by expression of a GFP reporter in the eye. Successful events were
screened for by the loss of GFP: as the PAM sites were distant from and flanking the insertion, loss
of fluorescence likely indicated removal of the intervening sequences (the lrp4 coding region). Five
such lines (representing identical events) were recovered and homozygous viable stocks established:
the allele was named dalek due to the ‘extermination’ of the lrp4 gene, and in homage to the classic
villains of ‘Doctor Who’. Loss of lrp4 was assessed using genomic DNA prepared from control and
lrp4dalek adults using the QIAgen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (QIAgen, Valencia, CA). Genomic
PCR bands corresponding to exon 2 (534 bp using primers 5’ TGTATTCCACGAACCTGGGTATG 3’
and 5’ CAAAATGCAGCGCCCATTGTT 3’) and the exon 7–8 junction (615 bp using primers 5’ AGTC
TTGATGGTAGCAATAGGCAT 3’ and 5’ CTCTGGTAGATTTTGACACTG 3’) revealed the absence of
both regions in lrp4dalek. The lrp4dalek deletion was further confirmed by the presence of a 315 bp
‘Flank’ band (with some background bands present only with the lrp4dalek deletion) representing the
connection of sequences from the 5’ and 3’ UTRs (amplified by primers 5’ AACAGAATCGGAACAG-
CAGTT 3’ and 5’ GAGCTTTAACAGGACACGTTT 3’) not present in control samples (see Figure 1—

 figure supplement 2B). Finally, antibody staining (see below) revealed the elimination of LRP4 signal
in the lrp4dalek allele, suggesting the creation of a null allele.
Cloning of LRP4 cDNA and transgene construction
An adult Drosophila cDNA library was made according to manufacturer’s protocol using the GeneR-
acer Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog #L150201, Waltham, MA). From the library, the lrp4 cDNA
was amplified using the forward primer 5’ CACCATGTATTTGACAGCCTTT 3’ and the reverse primer
5’ TGTGATAGTCGAGAGCGT 3’ (without the endogenous Stop codon) and cloned directly into the
pENTR vector using the pENTR/D-TOPO Cloning Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Catalog #K240020,
Waltham, MA). Complete cDNA clones were verified by sequencing. UAS-LRP4-HA was made by
recombining pENTR-LRP4 with pUAST-attB-Gateway-3xFLAG-3xHA29 via LR clonase. The resultant
pUAST-attB-LRP4-3xHA-3xFLAG was transformed into the FC31 landing site 86Fb on the 3rd chro-
mosome using standard methods.
Production of LRP4 antibodies
Custom antibodies were made by Pierce Custom Services (ThermoFisher, Rockford, IL) against the
C-NKRNSRGSSRSVLTFSNPN peptide corresponding to residues 1921–1939 of the intracellular side
of LRP4. Rat antisera were Ig-purified and then used at a dilution of 1:200 on adult brains. The speci-
ficity of the antibody was verified by the absence of signal in the lrp4dalek mutant.
Alignment of LRP4 homologues
The
Drosophila
melanogaster
(CG8909;
accession
AAF48538.1),
Mus
musculus
(accession
NP_766256.3), and Homo sapiens (accession NP_002325.2) LRP4 sequences were obtained from
NCBI. CLUSTALW alignment was performed using PSI/T-Coffee for transmembrane proteins (http://
tcoffee.crg.cat/apps/tcoffee/do:tmcoffee) and expressed graphically using ESPript3.0 (http://espript.
ibcp.fr/ESPript/ESPript/).
Drosophila stocks and transgenic strains
All controls, stocks, and crosses were raised at 25˚C. Mutants and transgenes were maintained over
balancer chromosomes to enable selection in adult or larval stages. The GMR90B08-GAL4
(Pfeiffer et al., 2008) line was used to examine lrp4 expression (referred to as lrp4-GAL4). Four
UAS-RNAi lines against differing regions of lrp4 were also identified: UAS-lrp4-RNAi 1 (v29900,
Vienna Drosophila Resource Center), UAS-lrp4-RNAi 2 (v108629, Vienna Drosophila Resource Cen-
ter), UAS-lrp4-RNAi 3 (JF01570, Harvard TRiP Collection), UAS-lrp4-RNAi 4 (JF01632, Harvard TRiP
Collection). The following GAL4 lines enabled tissue-specific expression: Or47b-GAL4 (VA1v ORNs)
(Vosshall et al., 2000), Or67d-GAL4 (DA1 ORNs) (Kurtovic et al., 2007), Or88a-GAL4 (VA1d ORNs)
(Vosshall et al., 2000), AM29-GAL4 (DL4 and DM6 ORNs) (Endo et al., 2007), Mz19-GAL4 (DA1,
VA1d, DC3 PNs) (Jefferis et al., 2004), Mz699-GAL4 (inhibitory projection neurons that project to
the lateral horn) (Lai et al., 2008; Liang et al., 2013), GAD1-GAL4 (GABAergic inhibitory neurons)
(Ng et al., 2002), pebbled-GAL4 (all ORNs) (Sweeney et al., 2007). The following UAS transgenic
lines were used as either reporters or to alter gene function: UAS-Syt-HA (Robinson et al., 2002),
UAS-Brp-Short-mStraw (Fouquet et al., 2009), UAS-DSyd1-GFP (Owald et al., 2010), UAS-Da7-
GFP (Leiss et al., 2009), UAS-mCD8-GFP (Lee and Luo, 1999), UAS-3xHA-mtdT (Potter et al.,
2010), UAS-FRT-Stop-FRT-mCD8-GFP (Hong et al., 2009), UAS-Dcr2 (Dietzl et al., 2007), UAS-
GABABR2-RNAi (Root et al., 2008), UAS-srpk79D-RNAi (Johnson et al., 2009), UAS-venus-
SRPK79D-#28 (Johnson et al., 2009), UAS-venus-SRPK79D-#1A (Johnson et al., 2009). Intersec-
tional analyses were done using the eyFLP3.5 construct (Chotard et al., 2005) which expresses FLP
in ORNs, but not PNs and GH146-FLP (Hong et al., 2009), which expresses in 2/3 of all olfactory
PNs but not ORNs. The srpk79Datc allele (Johnson et al., 2009) was used to remove srpk79D
function.
Immunocytochemistry
Adult brains were dissected at 10 days post eclosion as previously described (Mosca and Luo,
2014; Wu and Luo, 2006). Third instar larvae were dissected as previously described (Mosca and
Schwarz, 2010). The following primary antibodies were used: mouse antibody to Bruchpilot (1:40,

Jackson ImmunoResearch, Catalog #123-605-021, West Grove, PA). Alexa488-, Alexa568-, and
Alexa647-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:250 (ThermoFisher Scientific and Jackson
ImmunoResearch, Various Catalog #s). CF633-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:250
(Biotium). FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies were used at 1:200 (Jackson ImmunoResearch,
Catalog #703-095-155, West Grove, PA).
Proximity ligation assay
Brains were processed as described and stained using rabbit anti-GFP antibodies at 1:500 (Thermo-
Fisher Scientific, Catalog #A-11122, Waltham, MA) with FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and
mouse anti-HA antibodies at 1:250 (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog #A2095, St. Louis, MO) with Alexa647-
conjugated secondary antibodies, leaving the red channel open. For PLA, we used the DuoLink
Mouse Rabbit in situ PLA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog #DUO92101, St. Louis, MO). Following the last
wash after secondary antibody incubation, the brains were incubated in the anti-mouse and / or anti-
rabbit PLA probes at a 1:5 dilution for 2 hr at 37˚C. Brains were then washed thrice for 10’ each with
Wash Buffer A, and incubated in Ligation solution (1:40 ligase in ligation buffer) for 1 hr at 37˚C.
Brains were washed in Wash buffer A for three times at 10’ each and then incubated in Amplification
solution (1:80 dilution of polymerase in Amplification buffer) for 2 hr at 37˚C. Finally, brains were
washed three times for 10’ each in Wash Buffer B, and incubated in SlowFade overnight before
mounting. Controls without Probes went through the identical process as those with probes, but
with water substituted for the probes themselves in the first PLA step. Brains were imaged as
described via confocal microscopy.
Imaging, synaptic quantification and image processing
All images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM510 Meta laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) using either a 40 � 1.4 NA PlanApo or a 63 � 1.4 NA PlanApo lens. Images
of synaptic puncta (Brp-Short-mStraw or Da7-GFP) and neurite membrane (mCD8-GFP, 3xHA-
mTDT) were imaged, processed and quantified as previously described (Mosca and Luo, 2014) with
the following adjustments: images of synaptic puncta in the lateral horn (Mz19-GAL4, Mz699-GAL4,
Figure 5, Figure 5—figure supplement 1) were imaged at 63X, with an optical zoom of 2. Mz19
and Mz699 images were processed with a spot size of 0.6 mm and neurite volume calculated with a
smoothing of 0.2 mm and a local contrast of 0.5 mm.
Images were processed and figures prepared using Adobe Photoshop CS4 and Adobe Illustrator
CS4 (Adobe Systems, San Jose, CA). For antibody staining comparisons between genotypes, sam-
ples were imaged and processed under identical conditions. Fluorescence intensity was measured
with ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
Electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy was performed on 10 day old adult control and lrp4dalek male
brains as previously described (Mosca and Luo, 2014). Putative ORN terminals were identified
based on morphology (Rybak et al., 2016; Tobin et al., 2017) and quantified as described
(Mosca and Luo, 2014). Terminal perimeter was measured using ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and
used to calculate T-bar density. All quantification was done with the user blind to the genotype.

 Expansion microscopy
Protein retention expansion microscopy (Tillberg et al., 2016) was modified for use with Drosophila
brain tissue. Fixed and antibody-labeled brains were treated with 100 mg / mL acryloyl-X, SE (Ther-
moFisher Scientific, Catalog #A20770, Waltham, MA) overnight at room temperature and then
embedded in polyelectrolyte gel for two hours at 37˚C. Slices containing brains were excised from
solidified polyelectrolyte gel and immersed in digestion buffer with 200 mg / mL Proteinase K (Ther-
moFisher Scientific, Catalog #AM2546, Waltham, MA) overnight at room temperature. Slices
achieved maximum expansion after five washes with deionized water. Fully expanded gel slices were
anchored to the bottom of a petri dish with 2% low melting point agarose. Confocal microscopy
images were obtained on a Leica SP8 with a 25x water immersion objective (Leica Microsystems,
Wetzlar Germany).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was completed using Prism 6.07 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). For rep-
resentative datasets, the experimenter was blind to genotype during quantification and data analy-
sis. Significance between two samples was determined using student’s t-test. Significance amongst
multiple samples was determined using one-way ANOVA with a Tukey’s post-test to correct for mul-
tiple comparisons. Significance between two samples (for EM) was determined using a two-tailed
student’s t-test.
Behavioral analyses
Olfactory trap assays were constructed as described (Potter et al., 2010). Flies were raised in a 12/
12 light/dark incubator. For each cohort, 25 flies of the appropriate genotype were starved over-
night in a 1% agar vial in complete darkness. They were anesthetized briefly on ice and transferred
to the olfactory trap, which contained an experimental vial of apple cider vinegar (ACV: Safeway,
Palo Alto, CA) and a control vial of water. Flies were then left in the trap for 16 hr in complete dark-
ness before being quantified. Preference index was calculated as (FliesACV – FliesWater) / FliesTotal.
