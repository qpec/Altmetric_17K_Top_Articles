Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify patterns
of postdischarge prescription fills following an opioid-related
hospitalization.
Methods: Using the 2010–2014 MarketScan Commercial
Claims and Encounters database, this analysis identified the
percentage of patients (N536,719) with an opioid-related
inpatient admission who received substance use disorder
treatment medications within 30 days of being discharged.
Results: Thirty-five percent of the sample did not have any
prescription fills in the 30-day postdischarge period. Less
than a quarter (16.7%) of patients received any FDA-approved
opioid dependence medication in the 30 days following dis-
charge. Forty percent of patients in the sample received an-
tidepressants, 15.6% received antipsychotics, 13.9% filled a
prescription for a benzodiazepine, and 22.4% filled a pre-
scription for an opioid pain medication.
Conclusions: More effort is needed to ensure that patients
hospitalized for opioid misuse are receiving recommended
services.

Opioid misuse is a significant public health problem. Esti-
mates from the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health
show that nearly 1.9 million people in the United States have a
substance use disorder related to prescription opioids and
that 517,000 have a substance use disorder related to heroin
(1). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention esti-
mates that poisoning deaths involving an opioid analgesic
accounted for 51.4% of all drug overdose deaths in 2013 (2).
This epidemic has led to a significant increase in hospi-
talizations for opioid misuse (3). Hospitalizations for opioid
misuse increased by 150% between 1993 and 2012 (4). In
2012, the hospitalization rate for opioid misuse was 295.6
stays per 100,000 (4). Past research has shown that outpatient
treatment services that include residential treatment, partial
hospitalization, and intensive outpatient services are consis-
tently associated with positive recovery and that patients who
do not receive follow-up services have a much higher risk of
being readmitted (5–7).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has ap-
proved three different medications to treat opioid dependence:
methadone, naltrexone, and buprenorphine (8). When given
through an individualized treatment regimen by a certified
provider who has assessed the patient, these medications
help reduce problem addiction behaviors (8). The approved
medications provide a safe, controlled level of medication
to address the physiological effects of opioid addiction and
can be safely administered for as long as needed. They are
recommended as clinical treatment of adults who have an
opioid use disorder with physiological dependence: they sig-
nificantly augment treatment retention, decrease illicit opioid
use, reduce the burden of opioid craving, and, in the case of ago-
nist therapies, provide effective relief from opioid-withdrawal
syndrome (6,9,10).
The overarching goal of this study was to identify patterns
of postdischarge prescription fills following a hospitalization
for opioid misuse, a key step in determining whether patients
are receiving appropriate medication after opioid-related
inpatient treatment. Given the increasing rate of such hos-
pitalizations, this timely information is important for de-
veloping targeted prevention, intervention, and treatment
options for patients with opioid use disorders.
METHODS
This study used data from the Truven Health MarketScan
Commercial Claims and Encounters database for the years
2010 through 2014. The MarketScan database includes in-
surance claims from employees and their dependents cov-
ered by large, self-insured employers and by regional health
plans. It captures all billed services, including prescription
drugs, outpatient services, and inpatient services. Mental
health and substance misuse services provided by separate
behavioral health management companies through a carve-
out arrangement also are captured in the database.

BRIEF REPORTS
 The cohort included individuals ages 18 to
64 who were hospitalized for opioid abuse,
dependence, or overdose between January 1,
2010, and September 30, 2014, in an acute
care hospital or psychiatric facility. Patients
who did not have at least 30 days of contin-
uous enrollment after being discharged were
omitted to ensure that patterns of care after
hospitalization could be identified. We also
excluded individuals who did not have at
least 90 days of continuous enrollment before
their inpatient admission. If an individual had
more than one inpatient admission that met
our inclusion criteria, we selected the first
admission as the index admission for all analyses.
Opioid misuse was determined by the presence of one or
more ICD-9 diagnostic codes for opioid abuse, dependence,
poisoning, or adverse effects (304.0x, 304.7x, 3.05.5x, 965.0x,
E850.0–E850.2, E935.1, and E935.2), whether or not the code
was for the primary diagnosis. We excluded inpatient ad-
missions with diagnoses of suicide and self-inflicted poisoning
(E950.0–E950.5) or assault by poisoning (E962.0).
Use of FDA-approved medication for the treatment of
opioid dependence was defined as a prescription fill for
buprenorphine or naltrexone or a paid claim for methadone.
We identified use of buprenorphine and naltrexone for
treatment of substance use disorders by using the National
Drug Code (NDC) on the prescription drug claims. Federal
regulations require that patients who are receiving metha-
done to treat opioid dependence receive their medications
from a certified opioid treatment program; therefore, we
identified methadone for treatment of substance use disor-
ders by using Healthcare Common Procedure Coding Sys-
tem service codes. We determined whether a prescription
for any of these three types of substance use disorder med-
ications was filled within 30 days of the discharge date of the
index admission.
We also defined four additional classes of prescription
medication use in the 30-day postdischarge window: antide-
pressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, and opioid pain
medications, such as oxycodone methadone, morphine, fentanyl,
hydrocodone, and tramadol. The use of methadone for pain was
identified as a prescription fill. We included benzodiazepines,
which are contraindicated in the population of individuals with
an opioid-related hospitalization because of the increased risk
of poor outcomes associated with the combined use of opioids
and benzodiazepines (11). We included antidepressants and
antipsychotics because a preliminary analysis of the cohort in
the online MarketScan Treatment Pathways tool showed that
prescriptions for these medications were common among the
cohort prior to hospitalization.
RESULTS
We identified 36,719 patients with an inpatient admission for
opioid abuse, dependence, or overdose that met our inclusion
criteria; 42% (N515,432) were women, and 58% (N521,297)
were between the ages of 18 and 35.
Figure 1 shows the frequency of prescriptions in the 30-day
postdischarge window. The categories shown are not mutu-
ally exclusive. Less than a quarter (16.7%, N56,132) of
patients received any FDA-approved medication for opioid
use disorder in the 30 days following discharge. The most
commonly filled prescription was antidepressants, received
by 40.3% (N514,798) of patients in the sample. Antipsy-
chotic prescriptions were filled by 15.6% (N55,728) of
patients, and 22.4% (N58,225) filled a prescription for an
opioid pain medication. Benzodiazepines were filled by 13.9%
(N55,104) of patients, making them the least frequently filled
drug in the postdischarge period among the five classes ex-
amined. Additionally, 7.4% (N52,717) of the sample filled
prescriptions for both a benzodiazepine and an opioid pain
medicine within 30 days of discharge. Thirty-five percent
(N512,852) of the sample did not have any prescription fills in
the 30-day postdischarge window.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Many studies have shown that FDA-approved opioid de-
pendence medication is an important component of treat-
ment services for opioid abuse or dependence. Recent
research has also shown that 40% of privately insured in-
dividuals received no follow-up services within 30 days
following an opioid-related hospitalization and that only 11%
received the recommended combination of both medication
and therapeutic services (12). Given the high rates at which
follow-up services are not provided and the clinical recom-
mendations in support of use of medications, the relatively
low rate of opioid dependence medication reported in this
study is of concern. More research is needed to understand
the policy, structural, and financial barriers facing patients
with an opioid use disorder in trying to access outpatient
services that include opioid dependence medication.
In addition, the postdischarge use of opioid pain medi-
cations and benzodiazepines observed in this study also
raises concerns. Some prescribing of opioid pain medication
following an opioid-related hospitalization may be due to the
prescriber’s being unaware of the patient’s hospitalization.

 Prescription drug monitoring programs and notification of
providers on the basis of insurance claims can help make
prescribers aware of opioid-related hospitalizations, although
patients can continueto obtain opioidpain medicinebychanging
providers, paying for prescription opioids with cash, or seeking
opioids illegally (13).
The combined use of benzodiazepines and opioid
medications is associated with an increased risk of ad-
verse outcomes, including fatal opioid overdose (11,13).
The finding that 13.9% of patients filled a benzodiazepine
prescription, 22.4% filled an opioid prescription, and 7%
filled both after an opioid-related hospitalization suggests
that targeted outreach to physicians and patients about rec-
ommended prescribing practices and the risks associated
with the combined use of benzodiazepine and opioid use may
be warranted.
A limitation of this study was that it measured prescrip-
tions filled, not prescriptions written or medications taken.
Patients may not fill prescriptions that providers prescribe.
They may also not take the medication after the prescription
has been filled. The correspondence between medications
prescribed and medications taken by the patient has been
shown to vary by drug (14). Analysis of physician prescribing
and patient consumption of medications requires data be-
yond what are typically available in insurance claims.
Another limitation of the study was that some individuals
who were hospitalized for an opioid overdose may not have
deliberately misused opioids. We could not distinguish be-
tween diagnoses for opioid overdose that were related to
deliberate misuse or addiction and those from accidental
misuse or complications of prescribed use.
Finally, it should be noted that this study assessed patterns
of prescription fills in a commercially insured population;
therefore, interpretations about patterns of prescription med-
ication use in an uninsured population or in a population
covered by Medicaid should be made with caution.
Initiation of buprenorphine and naloxone in the emergency
department, along with screening, brief intervention, and re-
ferral to treatment, has been shown to improve postdischarge
outcomes for patients seen in the emergency department for
opioid dependence, including patient engagement in treatment
for substance use disorders (15). Further research will be needed
to identify barriers to postdischarge treatment at the patient and
provider levels and to determine strategies to address them.
