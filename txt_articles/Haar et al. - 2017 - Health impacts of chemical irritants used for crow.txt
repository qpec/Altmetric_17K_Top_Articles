Abstract
Background: Chemical irritants used in crowd control, such as tear gases and pepper sprays, are generally considered
to be safe and to cause only transient pain and lacrimation. However, there are numerous reports that use and misuse
of these chemicals may cause serious injuries. We aimed to review documented injuries from chemical irritants to
better understand the morbidity and mortality associated with these weapons.
Methods: We conducted a systematic review using PRISMA guidelines to identify injuries, permanent disabilities, and
deaths from chemical irritants worldwide between January 1, 1990 and March 15, 2015. We reviewed injuries to
different body systems, injury severity, and potential risk factors for injury severity. We also assessed region, context and
quality of each included article.
Results: We identified 31 studies from 11 countries. These reported on 5131 people who suffered injuries, two of
whom died and 58 of whom suffered permanent disabilities. Out of 9261 total injuries, 8.7% were severe and required
professional medical management, while 17% were moderate and 74.3% were minor. Severe injuries occurred to
all body systems, with the majority of injuries impacting the skin and eyes. Projectile munition trauma caused 231
projectile injuries, with 63 (27%) severe injuries, including major head injury and vision loss. Potentiating factors for
more severe injury included environmental conditions, prolonged exposure time, and higher quantities of chemical
agent in enclosed spaces.
Conclusions: Although chemical weapons may have a limited role in crowd control, our findings demonstrate that
they have significant potential for misuse, leading to unnecessary morbidity and mortality. A nuanced understanding
of the health impacts of chemical weapons and mitigating factors is imperative to avoiding indiscriminate use of
chemical weapons and associated health consequences.

 Background
The rise in frequency of popular protests in recent years
throughout the world is a manifestation of the exercise
of the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and
peaceful assembly [1]. There are many reports, however,
that the frequent use of chemical irritants, commonly re-
ferred to as tear gases or pepper sprays, can potentially
undermine these freedoms by causing injuries, intimidat-
ing communities, and leading to escalations in violence
on all sides [2–5].
Chemical irritants are generally expected to cause
transient lacrimation, blepharospasm, superficial pain,
and disorientation, without permanent injury or death
[6, 7]. The first tear gases were developed in the 1920s
but, despite the frequency of their use since the 1960s,
there has been limited analysis of their mechanisms of
injury and potential lethality and longer-term morbidity
[8]. Historically, chemical irritants have been considered
“nonlethal” or “less lethal” but the intent of temporary
irritation may misrepresent the actual health conse-
quences and the impacts of real-world use and misuse of
these weapons [8–10].
Chemical irritants are manufactured by many compan-
ies around the globe. Historically, most companies were
based in the United States, but the past decade has seen
the development of manufacturing in Brazil, China, Israel,
South Korea, and several other countries [11, 12]. The
wide variety of chemical agents, concentrations, unit sizes,
and delivery mechanisms used in crowd control compli-
cates full understanding of the effects of these weapons.
Research and manufacturer information suggest that
chemical irritants can be utilized in a number of ways, but
are generally deployed for crowd dispersal or to restrain
an individual [13]. Mechanisms of delivery can include
sprays or pellets that target specific individuals. Alterna-
tively, canisters, munitions, grenades, and chemical mix-
tures within water cannons are deployed for crowd
dispersal or incapacitation of a large group of people.
Though other chemical agents have been used histor-
ically, there are two classes of chemical compounds most
commonly
used
by
law
enforcement
agencies.
2-
chlorobenzalmalonitrile (agent CS under military classi-
fication) is the most frequently identified active chemical
in “tear gas” [14]. Media reports indicate that, in 2013,
tear gas was deployed more than 312 times in protests
around the world [8]. Though a few countries have sig-
nificant restrictions on the use of agent CS, many more
countries utilize it as their crowd-control weapon of
choice [15]. While the effects of CS are considered tem-
porary at low concentrations, higher concentrations have
been known to cause permanent injury (primarily to the
respiratory system) and death in experimental animal
studies as well as anecdotal human exposures [16]. The
National Academy of Sciences in the United States does
not identify a minimum safe concentration, as even the
lowest concentrations can result in “notable discomfort,
irritation, or certain asymptomatic, non-sensory but
transient effects” [17, 18].
Oleoresin capsicum (agent OC) and its synthetic form,
pelargonic acid vanillylamide or capsaicin II (PAVA), are
highly concentrated forms of the active ingredients in
hot peppers. They are available to the lay public in some
countries as personal protective “pepper spray” and as
military grade agent OC spray, but are not publicly avail-
able in the United Kingdom [19]. Agent OC is increas-
ingly prevalent in crowd-control contexts and has been
used on protesters globally [20–23]. While several coun-
tries have limitations on the possession and use of OC,
it is unregulated in most countries [24, 25].
The volume and concentration of chemical in each
spray and aerosol varies considerably among manufac-
tures and countries [18]. Stated concentrations of OC
may be misleading, because the potency of OC is
dependent not only on the concentration within a solvent
but on the strength of the capsicum extracted [20–22, 25].
Of concern, chemical irritants may contain numerous
other toxic chemicals, including alcohols, organic solvents,
halogenated hydrocarbons, and propellants such as Freon,
tetrachloroethylene, and methylene chloride. The use of
solvents such as tetracholoroethylene and methylene
chloride may enable deeper skin penetration as well as
larger quantities of irritant to be dissolved and dispersed,
potentially exacerbating some of the effects attributed to
pepper spray [7, 16, 21, 26, 27]. Dose levels for symptoms,
toxic effects and lethal outcomes of CS and OC have not
been well established. Studies suggest that even a very low
(.003 mg/m3) concentration can lead to ocular irritation
[7]. The dose of CS and OC in exposed individuals may be
markedly increased by the use of multiple grenades and/
or canisters at the same location over a short period of
time, particularly in areas where people cannot easily es-
cape. This further complicates the analysis of the toxicity
of these chemicals in everyday use.
There is limited knowledge about the burden of injury
from chemical irritants. There is also inadequate under-
standing of potential risk factors contributing to more
severe injuries, as well as how law enforcement actions
and policy may impact these injuries. While several re-
cent reviews seek to better understand the range of in-
juries attributed to agent CS specifically [28] or the
medical effects of several different agents [29], we know
of no other review that seeks to provide data on injuries
secondary to both agent CS and agent OC in the context
of crowd control. To address some of the gaps in the lit-
erature and understand the burden of injury attributed
to chemical irritants, as well as to better understand the
role of law enforcement and policy makers, we conducted
a systematic review of data on injuries, permanent

 disabilities, and deaths secondary to chemical irritants
worldwide over the past 25 years. We sought to review
the type and severity of injuries of individuals who present
for medical care after exposure to chemical irritants, com-
pare the impacts of agents used and study the factors that
may have an effect on the rate and severity of injuries.
Methods
We undertook a systematic review of the literature to
determine the burden, severity, and range of injuries
from chemical irritants using the Preferred Reporting
Items
for
Systematic
Reviews
and
Meta-analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines.
Search strategy
We searched PubMed, Toxnet, JSTOR, and Scopus
using search terms cross-referenced with the MeSH
database with no language restrictions [30]. We ex-
panded our search to include non peer-reviewed publi-
cations as well as relevant reports identified by experts
in the field. Gray literature searches were also conducted
using reference lists of relevant articles and recommen-
dations from experts. We included data from all types of
studies, including experimental and observational stud-
ies and case series with at least five subjects.
In our search terminology, we tried to capture the di-
verse terms used for chemical irritants in the literature,
including “tear gas,” “pepper spray,” and agents CS, CN,
CR, CX, OC, and PAVA (Table 1). The databases and
complete search terms are presented in the appendix.
References were managed using the bibliographic soft-
ware Zotero (V4.0.28.6).
Study selection
Articles were included if they documented injuries,
deaths, or other medical or psychological health conse-
quences of chemical irritants on human subjects and
were published between January 1, 1990 and March 30,
2015. We included studies of cohorts of all ages, gen-
ders, and ethnicities. We included data from all contexts
of chemical irritant use, including demonstrations and
protests, riots, sporting events, prisons, arrests, and acci-
dental exposures, as well as military or police training
events. We excluded studies that lacked adequate docu-
mentation on injuries, were not accessible for full text
review, or were animal and cadaver studies.
Titles and abstracts of the articles were screened for
relevance. Full texts of all potentially relevant articles
were reviewed against our inclusion criteria.
Data extraction
Data from all eligible articles were then extracted and
compiled in a database (Microsoft Excel for Mac 2011
v14.4.1). All articles were read and coded by two authors
(RH and MD). Disagreements were resolved by discus-
sion between the authors. For each study, we identified
the chemical agent, deployment mechanism (spray versus
aerosol or versus mechanical injuries from the projectile
munition), region/country, demographic characteristics,
and study setting. We categorized the outcome for sub-
jects as recovered, permanently disabled, or dead, and
classified each injury by severity and body system. Injury
severity was coded based on the acuity and the resources
required to manage that injury. Minor injuries were tran-
sient symptoms that may not be present on physical exam
or are expected side effects of chemical irritants, such as
blepharospasm, lacrimation, mild respiratory distress, sore
throat, or nausea. Moderate injuries were those that were
unexpected from previous published data on chemical ir-
ritants, were evident on physical exam, or lasted longer
than expected, but may not require management by a
health professional. Injuries such as persistent skin rashes
or erythema, first-degree burns, conjunctivitis or eye injur-
ies, oropharyngeal edema, persistent respiratory symp-
toms, and vomiting were classified as moderate injuries.
We classified as severe injuries those that necessitate pro-
fessional medical care, such as lacerations requiring su-
tures, second- or third-degree burns, airway obstruction,
severe ocular trauma, cardiopulmonary disease, or abdom-
inal injuries requiring medical or surgical management.
Injury data was only included if it was documented by a
medical professional. Injuries that were reported by
patients, without any documentation, were excluded.

 We utilized the NIH Quality Assessment Tool to clas-
sify each article as poor, moderate, or high quality [31].
This tool was chosen to standardize the quality of case
series and observational studies, which made up a ma-
jority of the identified articles.
Data analysis
We conducted descriptive analysis of injuries from
chemical irritants to categorize the range of injuries and
their severity. We also evaluated mediating or moderat-
ing environmental or practical factors that may have in-
creased or reduced injuries. We expected significant
heterogeneity and quality limitations that would pre-
clude pooled data analysis or a direct comparison of the
different chemical irritants.
Results
Our search yielded 1714 discrete studies, of which 311
required full text review (Fig. 1). Twenty-nine articles
met inclusion criteria and were included in our review
(Table 2) [32–60]. Two additional articles and reports
were identified by hand-searching the citation lists of in-
cluded articles and by expert consultations [61, 62].
Quality assessment of the articles yielded 21 “high qual-
ity studies” that fulfilled 7 or greater of the nine criteria
and 10 “moderate quality studies” that fulfilled between
4 and 6 of the criteria. (Table 2 is categorized by study
quality).
Demographic analysis
Of the total of 31 studies included in the analysis, 16 were
retrospective cohort studies, seven were prospective co-
hort studies, six were case series and two were non-peer
reviewed reports from reputable human rights organiza-
tions. The number of subjects ranged from two to 3697
(median 31) (one study met the inclusion criteria of five
subjects, and although several of the subjects sustained
injuries from another weapon, the study was nonetheless
included). In studies in which gender was reported, 57% of
subjects were male and 43% were female. In studies in
which age was reported, the age ranged from 3 months to
94 years, with an mean age of 25.7 years. The injury con-
text included protests (10), arrests (five), military or police
training exercises (five), accidental exposures (five), and a
detention center riot (one); some of the studies included
injuries in more than one context. The eligible studies
included data from 11 countries and were published be-
tween 1993 and 2015 (Fig. 2).
Twenty-six studies included data on injuries caused by
Agent CS and 14 included data on injuries caused by
Agent OC. Sixteen studies evaluated dry aerosolized
forms, such as grenade-type deployment of the chemical
agent and 15 included sprays formulated with solvents.

 Seven of the studies recorded injuries that resulted from
the projectile munition containing chemical irritant
causing direct trauma to subjects.
Analysis of injuries and deaths
In the included articles, a total of 5910 people were ex-
posed to chemical irritants and sought medical attention,
of whom 5131 (87%) suffered injuries or died as a result
of the exposure. Of those who suffered injuries, two
people died and 67 (1.3%) suffered permanent disability.
The majority fully recovered from their injuries (98.7%).
Deaths
Two deaths were documented in the selected articles. A
report from Bahrain documented the case of a man who
died of respiratory arrest after agent CS aerosol was fired
inside his home. In another case, the chemical irritant
projectile munition contributed to one death from trau-
matic brain injury after protests in Nepal. There were no
deaths associated with agent OC.
Permanent injuries and disabilities
Fifty-eight
people
experienced
permanent
disability
(Fig. 3). Eighteen of the disabilities were secondary to
traumatic injuries from the projectile munitions. These
included globe ruptures and blindness (four people),
traumatic brain injury resulting in a persistent vegetative
state (one person), limb amputations (three people), and
functional loss of limbs (10 people). Persistent psychi-
atric symptoms were documented in 14 people and per-
sistent
symptoms
of
asthma
and
other
respiratory
complaints were reported in 23 people. Chronic derma-
tological conditions such as hypersensitivity reactions
were documented by skin testing in three people. In one
study of 297 individuals seeking care and/or evaluation
of injuries following the 2013 Gezi Park protests in
Turkey, 117 psychiatric evaluations were conducted. Of
those, 50 (43%) met diagnostic criteria for acute stress
disorder, 27 (23%) met diagnostic criteria for post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and nine (8 %) met
diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder [62].
Injuries
There were 9261 documented injuries, with multiple in-
juries occurring in each individual. In total, 6878 (74.2%)
of the injuries were categorized as mild, 1582 (17%) were
moderate injuries, and 865 (8.7%) were severe injuries

 (Fig. 4). While many body systems were affected, the
majority of injuries were to the skin, eyes, and cardiopul-
monary system. Injury severity varied depending on
body system affected (Fig. 5). Severity followed a pattern
of fewer injuries among the higher severity categories for
dermal,
ocular,
neurological,
cardiopulmonary,
and
intra-abdominal injuries. For instance, while the majority
of skin injuries (2539) were mild, 351 of the injuries
were moderate and 180 were severe. Similarly, for car-
diopulmonary injuries, there were 1220 mild injuries,
328 moderate injuries and 131 severe injuries. On the
other hand, there were more severe neurological injuries
(12%) than moderate neurologic injuries (1 %). Injuries
to the musculoskeletal system, as well as psychological
injuries, were all categorized as severe, based on the def-
inition employed.
Chemical agent
The nature of chemical irritant exposure and injuries is
also related to the chemical agent used, mechanism of
deployment, environmental conditions, and context of
use. Fourteen studies dealt exclusively with agent CS
and 10 studies exclusively studied agent OC. Three
studies included injury data from both chemical agents
or did not differentiate between the two. Four studies
reported exclusively on traumatic injuries from the pro-
jectile munition, while three other studies reported
some injuries from the projectile munition among other
injuries from the chemical agents themselves. Among
7156 documented injuries specifically from agent OC,
only 6 % were categorized as severe. In contrast, 27.9%
of 1148 injuries from agent CS were categorized as se-
vere (Fig. 6).
Other factors that may impact injury severity
To assess for other factors that may impact injury sever-
ity, we utilized a qualitative approach by perusing the ar-
ticles for data that may not fit into categorical variables
but would regardless be relevant. Several of these factors
were noted in the article text and are highlighted.
Deployment mechanism
The included studies documented injuries secondary to
both dry aerosolized and soluble spray forms of both
chemicals. Proximity to the area where the chemical was
released and the force of the propellant affected outcomes
[38, 40, 47, 53, 60]. We identified 5366 mild injuries, 884
moderate injuries, and 483 severe injuries from spray
forms of agent CS and OC. Among the injuries from spray
forms of chemical irritants, 7.2% were severe. We do-
cumented 1512 mild injuries, 676 moderate injuries, and
281 severe injuries from aerosolized forms of agent CS
and agent OC. Among injuries from aerosolized forms,
11.6% were severe. Comparative analysis of the deploy-
ment mechanisms using pooled data was not conducted,
given the concern for confounding factors.
The use of projectile munitions was documented to
cause 231 injuries, of which 63 (27%) were severe. There
were 73 traumatic injuries to the head and neck, includ-
ing at least four people who lost vision in an eye due to
projectile munition trauma. We documented 45 injuries
to the torso (chest, abdomen, back, and genitalia). There
were 61 upper extremity injuries and 34 lower extremity
injuries (including at least three people requiring ampu-
tations and 10 with severe functional loss of a limb due
to neurovascular injuries). Eighteen dermal injuries (8 %)
included bruises, lacerations, and heat burns.
Other factors
Several other factors were documented as exacerbating
the potential for injury, but they lacked detailed data for
analysis, such as documentation of specific injuries. Utili-
zing the weapons in confined spaces and in areas where
people could not easily escape potentially increased the
exposure to the irritant either in quantity or over time
[54]. One study in a detention center suggested that the
excessive number of injuries may have been caused by the
crowded and enclosed setting, which offered no opportun-
ity for people to escape [33]. Use of chemical irritants in
areas with high heat or humidity potentially exacerbated
skin irritation, and windy conditions risked the contamin-
ation of law enforcement officers, bystanders, or nearby
residences and businesses [33, 43, 53]. One study noted
that the use of agent CS for military training on a particu-
larly humid day, followed by strenuous exercise by
trainees, may have caused severe respiratory injuries
which resulted in several people requiring ICU-level care
[53]. Direct targeting of the face and eyes by hand-held

 spray has been noted to cause trauma and toxicity to the
cornea and conjunctiva of the eye [40, 41, 45, 50].
Discussion
The findings of our systematic review identified signifi-
cant morbidity and mortality associated with chemical
irritant agents CS and OC. Chemical irritants, like
many other crowd-control weapons, are typically justi-
fied as a safe tool to disperse potentially dangerous
groups or incapacitate threatening individuals as part of
the effort to ensure public safety. The prevailing pre-
sumption about these chemical agents is that they
cause minimal and transient irritation to the skin and
eyes, but are generally safe for use on diverse popula-
tions. However, we found that, by design or by inappro-
priate use, chemical irritants can cause significant
injuries as well as permanent disabilities. While deaths
were rare, we identified one death directly caused by
the blunt trauma from the projectile and another from
high dose exposure to the chemical agent in a closed
environment. These health consequences may be re-
lated to the chemical agents themselves, the total ex-
posure dose, the deployment technique, or the way
these weapons are used in different settings.

 Our findings indicate that agent CS and agent OC
were used both in protests and during arrest scenarios
and training exercises; contact also occurred through ac-
cidental exposure. Chemical irritants caused injuries to
many different body systems in addition to the expected
pain to the skin and eyes. We also documented a range
of injury severity for neurological, oropharyngeal, car-
diac, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal systems. The psy-
chological impact of the use of crowd-control weapons
has not been well studied or documented in the medical
literature, but cases described in this review indicate that
exposure to CCWs may result in significant psychiatric
symptoms and long-term disability.
In addition to documenting injuries, we identified factors
that may impact injury severity. Intrinsic characteristics of
the chemical agents themselves play a role. Chemical ir-
ritants, especially those deployed in aerosolized forms, are
inherently indiscriminate and can affect not only the
intended targets but also peaceful demonstrators, by-
standers, nearby communities and residences, and law en-
forcement officers themselves. The majority of people
injured are young adults, consistent with typical protest
demographics [63, 64]. We found a relatively equal gender
distribution of injuries. But many studies also found injur-
ies among children and elderly people that appear to valid-
ate concerns about the indiscriminate nature of chemical
irritants and their potential impact on bystanders and non-
violent demonstrators [65]. Children are more vulnerable
to severe injuries from chemical toxicity [66, 67]. The eld-
erly and those with chronic diseases are also prone to
worse outcomes from chemical irritants [68, 69]. Because
of the indiscriminate nature of chemical irritants, limiting
the exposure to individuals or small groups is difficult.
Most often a large, diverse, and differentially susceptible
group will be exposed, posing the risk of unnecessarily in-
juring nonviolent, potentially vulnerable people.
Perhaps even more concerning are the effects of these
chemical agents in settings where people are chronically
exposed to these chemicals, either by repeated use near
their homes or businesses, or because of occupational
use in which safety has never been studied and cannot
reasonably be assumed [34, 55, 58]. Repeated exposure
may be particularly concerning for law enforcement offi-
cers, people who attend protests frequently, and health
workers who may experience multiple occupational
exposures.
The decision to use chemical agents in specific envir-
onmental conditions and social contexts may also play a
role in injury severity. Clinical effects are likely dose-
dependent and excessive exposure may exacerbate sever-
ity. Studies included in this review show that the use of
chemical irritants in enclosed spaces without safe ave-
nues of egress increases exposure to the agent and exac-
erbates ensuing injuries [33, 35, 37, 39, 40, 61]. Although
our study excluded secondary injuries, we note reports
that there were several cases of chemical irritants spark-
ing mass panic and stampedes that contributed to sig-
nificant morbidity and mortality. These include at least
20 deaths in a sports stadium in Egypt in 2015, [70] 15
deaths in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in
2014, [71] 11 deaths in a stampede in Zimbabwe in
2014, [72] and 43 in South Africa in 2001, [73] all during
protests or in other crowded contexts. Deliberately aim-
ing the munition as a projectile weapon into dense
crowds or at individuals can cause severe traumatic in-
jury [42, 51, 54, 57, 62].
In conducting the broader research, we also identified
significant public concern over lack of transparency by
law enforcement and manufacturers about the agent(s)
used during specific events. Manufacturers often do not
provide adequate information on concentrations of che-
micals or the solvents and non-active ingredients that
may contribute to toxicity. In addition to the difficulties
this may pose to health workers trying to appropriately
manage patient injuries, lack of transparency can break
down trust and negatively impact relationships between
communities and law enforcement. Though this may be
an intended outcome in some repressive regimes, we
noted this concern in all uses of toxic chemical agents
against primarily unarmed civilian populations.
Policy implications and recommendations
The legal protections of the rights to freedom of expres-
sion and peaceful assembly, along with general principles
on the proportionate use of force by law enforcement,
provide some general guidance that the use of chemical
irritants,
along
with
other
crowd-control
weapons,
should be limited. Specifically, CCWs should only be
used in situations where particular individuals pose an
imminent violent threat, or where a protest requires dis-
persal because of widespread violent acts that pose an
imminent threat to public safety [74, 75]. In most situa-
tions where we found these weapons being used, neither
of these conditions was documented. The use of chem-
ical irritants as crowd-control weapons must be consid-
ered in the broader context of human rights, public
safety, use of force, and law enforcement practices ne-
cessary to maintain order in the context of demonstra-
tions. Open communication with demonstrators and the
community, arrests of violent individuals, and safeguards
for legal demonstration may obviate much of the de-
mand for these chemicals. Given the frequency of ser-
ious injury, disability, and death, the use of chemical
irritants should be strictly limited to situations of
imminent harm that cannot be policed effectively with
safer methods.
The Chemical Weapons Convention (effective since
1997 with 192 state signatories excluding only Egypt,
Haar et al. BMC Public Health  (2017) 17:831 
Page 11 of 14
 Israel, North Korea and South Sudan) prohibits the use
of these riot control agents’ during warfare. Significant
questions exist on the legality of military use of these
weapons in civilian protest. We recommend that law en-
forcement and the military be obligated to maintain
transparent and accurate data on use-of-force incidents,
particularly those that employ chemical irritants and
other crowd-control weapons. Active surveillance of in-
juries caused by chemical irritants is vital for manufac-
turers, law enforcement, and the community in order to
understand the risks and dangers of these weapons. This
data should be available and accessible to the public for
independent analysis.
We also note that combinations of OC and CS are be-
coming more common, both in spray and aerosol forms
as well as within projectiles such as the “pepper ball”
[16, 76, 77]. Several newer agents are also in develop-
ment, including agents CS1 and CS2 (which may extend
the half-life of CS or facilitate higher dermal penetra-
tion) and agent CX, which is reported to be more potent
than agent CS [16]. Each of these potential enhance-
ments to weapons may compound the already large
number of injuries. It is important that we address the
human costs of current chemical irritants before devel-
oping new, more potent ones.
While making law enforcement protocols publicly
available may not be possible due to security risks, we
recommend that police and military departments make
every effort to communicate with health workers and
the community in order to minimize potential injuries
from chemical irritants and to maintain trust. Training
of police officers must include education on human
rights principles and the obligation of the police to pro-
tect peaceful protestors. Police should also be trained in
the dangers of chemical irritants, guidelines on the safe
utilization of chemical irritants, the risks of repeated ex-
posures, environmental factors, and the risks of direct
trauma from poorly-aimed projectile munitions, as well
as other risk factors.
Limitations
Our systematic review had several limitations. In the ab-
sence of systematic reporting requirements on deaths
and injuries in crowd-control settings, it is likely that we
have largely underestimated the prevalence of deaths
and injuries. The limited follow-up in many of the arti-
cles also highlighted the lack of data on the chronic
health impacts of these weapons, which are likely under-
reported. We note that in our attempt to ensure valid
and reliable injury data, we have not accounted for a
large number of injuries and deaths from chemical irri-
tants that have been reported by the news media, by so-
cial justice organization reports, and by social media,
many of which include photographic or videographic
evidence of injuries. We also excluded reports that
lacked injury specifics or clear causation from chemical
irritants, but were likely linked to chemical irritant
utilization. We also excluded the significant number of
case reports in the published literature to avoid biasing
our results towards the publication of the most severe
injuries. In addition, there is wide variability in how
weapons are used and in the specific concentrations of
chemical agents; there is also a lack of data on the num-
ber of people exposed. Given these concerns, we were
not able to calculate population estimates of the impact
of chemical irritants or compare any specific agents or
numerical study results. However, severe injuries from
chemical irritants are not rare or isolated incidents. They
have occurred in many nations and under different types
of regimes and law enforcement protocols.
This review was also limited by the quality and meth-
odology of the available literature on chemical irritant
injuries. There are several potential biases, including the
potential over-publication of the most dramatic inci-
dents and independent limitations on individuals’ deci-
sion to seek medical care. On the other hand, difficulty
in gathering and publishing data in repressive regimes
may limit the availability of injury data from many in-
stances of chemical irritant utilization. There was also
significant heterogeneity in the participants and medical
treatments in different regions and clinical settings.
There was considerable methodological variability in the
study designs and settings. Each setting had variable
standards on the use of chemical irritants. However, the
overall quality of the studies was comparable to observa-
tional and case series-type studies addressing chemical
irritants. Given the multiple confounding factors, we
could not compare the chemical agents or deployment
mechanisms. Included studies did not provide enough
data to reliably estimate the risk of injury from any given
chemical irritant in an exposed population.
Conclusion
We found that chemical irritants cause severe injury,
permanent disabilities, and in rare cases, death. Despite
chemical irritants being recognized as safe weapons to
disperse or control crowds, the number and types of in-
juries documented in this review highlight the serious
risks associated with the frequent use of these weapons.
Specific risks include the use of chemical irritants in
enclosed spaces, excessive quantity of chemicals used,
specific environmental factors such as heat and humidity
and direct targeting of individuals, both with the project-
ile canister as well as spray to the face. Protocols to limit
indiscriminate use of chemical irritants are urgently
needed in order to safeguard human rights and prevent
unnecessary morbidity and mortality among protestors
and bystanders worldwide.
