BACKGROUND: We examined the association of cardiovascular health 
at younger ages with the proportion of life lived free of morbidity, the 
cumulative burden of morbidity, and average healthcare costs at older 
ages.
METHODS: The CHA study (Chicago Heart Association Detection Project 
in Industry) is a longitudinal cohort of employed men and women 18 
to 74 years of age at baseline examination in 1967 to 1973. Baseline 
measurements included blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, 
body mass index, and smoking. Individuals were classified into 1 of 4 
strata of cardiovascular health: favorable levels of all factors, 0 factors 
high but ≥1 elevated risk factors, 1 high risk factor, and ≥2 high risk 
factors. Linked Medicare and National Death Index data from 1984 to 
2010 were used to determine morbidity in older age. An individual’s all-
cause morbidity score and cardiovascular morbidity score were calculated 
from International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision codes for each 
year of follow-up.
RESULTS: We included 25 
804 participants who became ≥65 years of age 
by 2010, representing 65% of all original CHA participants (43% female; 
90% white; mean age, 44 years at baseline); 6% had favorable levels of 
all factors, 19% had ≥1 risk factors at elevated levels, 40% had 1 high 
risk factor, and 35% had ≥2 high risk factors. Favorable cardiovascular 
health at younger ages extended survival by almost 4 years and postponed 
the onset of all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity by 4.5 and 7 years, 
respectively, resulting in compression of morbidity in both absolute and 
relative terms. This translated to lower cumulative and annual healthcare 
costs for those in favorable cardiovascular health (P<0.001) during 
Medicare eligibility.
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals in favorable cardiovascular health in early 
middle age live a longer, healthier life free of all types of morbidity. These 
findings provide strong support for prevention efforts earlier in life aimed 
at preserving cardiovascular health and reducing the burden of disease in 
older ages.

T
he burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is ex-
pected to increase dramatically over the next sev-
eral decades, with estimates that 40.5% of the US 
population will be living with CVD by 2030.1 Primordial 
prevention (ie, preventing the development of risk fac-
tors, not just preventing disease once risk develops) 
may represent the most effective means of reducing the 
burden of CVD2 and was a key concept in guiding the 
development of national goals to improve the cardiovas-
cular health of the United Sates, including the American 
Heart Association’s 2020 Impact Goals3 and the Healthy 
People 2010 Goals.4 Favorable cardiovascular health in 
middle age has consistently been associated with de-
creased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality later in 
life, resulting in 5.8 to 9.5 additional years of life.5 Be-
yond mortality, favorable cardiovascular health results 
in even more dramatic reductions in the risk for incident 
CVD events6,7 and other major chronic diseases later in 
life.8,9
To date, little is known about how favorable cardio-
vascular health affects the overall burden and severity 
of morbidity in older age. The goal of this study was to 
determine whether favorable cardiovascular health is as-
sociated with longer, healthier lives or whether it simply 
extends life at the cost of increasing morbidity and cost.
METHODS
Sample
The CHA study (Chicago Heart Association Detection Project in 
Industry) is a longitudinal prospective investigation of 39 
522 
men and women (Asian, black, Hispanic, white, and other) 18 
to 74 years of age at baseline in 1967 to 1973 and employed 
in the Chicago area.10 Data were collected on demographic, 
medical history, and medical treatment by questionnaire; mea-
surement of height, weight, heart rate, casual blood pressure 
and ECG; and collection of blood for measurement of serum 
total cholesterol and plasma glucose 1 hour after a 50-g oral 
glucose load. The study was approved by the institutional 
review board at Northwestern University, and all participants 
signed an informed consent.
The CHA cohort has been followed for >40 years since 
baseline through personal contact, National Death Index data, 
and linked Medicare files from 1984 through 2010. In this 
study, we included CHA participants who were ≥65 years of 
age during follow-up and enrolled in Medicare fee for service. 
We excluded individuals missing baseline risk factor levels or 
demographic information. The final study cohort for this analy-
sis included 25 
804 individuals who became ≥65 years of age 
by 2010, representing 65% of all original CHA participants 
(Figure I in the online-only Data Supplement).
Favorable Cardiovascular Health
Favorable cardiovascular health was defined as having favor-
able levels of all major cardiovascular risk factors, including 
blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, body mass 
index, and smoking (Table 1). Individuals without a favorable 
cardiovascular health profile were further classified into 3 
mutually exclusive categories based on their risk factor lev-
els: 0 high risk factors but ≥1 elevated above favorable lev-
els, 1 high major risk factor, and ≥2 high major risk factors. 
Favorable, elevated, and high risk factor levels are defined in 
Table 1 according to appropriate clinical guidelines.
Morbidity Scores
All-cause morbidity was defined with the Gagne comorbidity 
score, a well-validated comorbidity score designed specifi-
cally for use with administrative (ie, Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services [CMS]) data and based on International 
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision discharge diagnosis 
codes.11 The score includes the following conditions (weights): 
metastatic cancer (5), congestive heart failure (2), dementia 
(2), renal failure (2), weight loss (2), hemiplegia, alcohol abuse, 
any tumor, cardiac arrhythmias, chronic pulmonary disease, 
coagulopathy, complicated diabetes mellitus, deficiency ane-
mias, fluid and electrolyte disorders, liver disease, peripheral 
vascular disorder, psychosis, pulmonary circulation disorders, 
HIV/AIDS (−1), and hypertension (−1). A higher score repre-
sents a greater comorbidity burden.
Cardiovascular morbidity was quantified with a CVD 
comorbidity score, defined by the sum of the presence of 4 
CVDs, including coronary heart disease (including myocardial 
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study presents the first information on the 
impact of cardiovascular health in middle age and 
the burden of morbidity, both all-cause and cardio-
vascular, in older age.
• Individuals in favorable cardiovascular health in mid-
dle age live a longer and healthier life than those 
with cardiovascular risk factors.
• Individuals in favorable cardiovascular health have 
a lower cumulative burden of morbidity and more 
years of healthy life.
• Important from a societal perspective, individuals in 
favorable cardiovascular health not only live longer 
but also have lower cumulative healthcare costs.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Our findings highlight the importance of prevention.
• At the individual level, living a longer and healthier 
life free of major morbidity can provide strong 
motivation to maintain and improve cardiovascular 
health across the life span.
• At the population and healthcare system levels, 
these findings directly support the need to improve 
prevention efforts and to target them earlier in life, 
before the development of adverse risk factor levels 
(ie, primordial prevention).
• Our data suggest that the resultant reductions in 
morbidity could translate to large savings in health-
care spending at the national level.

infarction), peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular dis-
ease, and chronic heart failure. The score ranged from 0 to 4, 
with increasing score reflecting a greater burden of CVD.
Scores were examined longitudinally over time for each CHA 
participant included in these analyses. Comorbid conditions were 
included in the score if they were present in any of the top 6 dis-
charge diagnoses codes (International Classification of Diseases, 
Ninth Revision codes) for any of the participant’s inpatient hospi-
talization or outpatient visit claims. The score was calculated for 
each participant at each year of age from 65 (or age in 1984, 
whichever is older) until death or the end of follow-up. If partici-
pants were not hospitalized or seen as an outpatient during any 
specific year, they were assigned a score of 0 for that year of 
age. Significant comorbidity was defined as a score of ≥1 consis-
tent with having an intermediate to high risk of 1-year mortality.11
Healthcare Costs
We examined differences in average annual costs using 
Medicare claims for each of our 4 cardiovascular health strata. 
Average annual costs were calculated as the total cumulative 
cost divided by the years of follow-up. Cost data from CMS 
data reflect charges for medical services obtained as a result 
of an inpatient hospital stay; outpatient services obtained at a 
hospital, at a clinic, or in a physician’s office; and fees for phy-
sician services. Because Medicare is considered the primary 
payer by other insurers, claims for individuals with additional 
coverage are still sent to CMS; thus, Medicare claims data pro-
vide a nearly complete documentation of hospital, home health 
agency, hospice, skilled nursing facility, and physician charges. 
Additional details are given in the online-only Data Supplement.
Statistical Analyses
In bivariate analyses, we examined demographic characteris-
tics of included CHA participants stratified by their burden of 
cardiovascular risk factors. We used χ2 tests and ANOVA to 
compare categorical and continuous characteristics of partici-
pants across the 4 risk factor strata, respectively. To examine 
the age at incidence of major morbidity, we restricted these 
models to the ≈70% (n=17 
939 for all-cause morbidity and 
18 
714 for cardiovascular morbidity) of CHA participants for 
whom we had Medicare follow-up starting at age 65 and who 
had morbidity scores of 0 at age 65. We used a penalized 
spline model to obtain a nonparametric estimate of the mean 
comorbidity score over ages 65 to 90 for each stratum of car-
diovascular health profile.12 A random intercept was included in 
the model to take into account the within-individual correlation. 
We examined the times to 4 events: (1) time to morbidity score 
reaching 1 or death, (2) time to morbidity score reaching 2 or 
death, (3) time to morbidity score reaching 3 or death, and 
(4) time to death. Because censoring precludes estimation of 
these mean survival times, we used the Irwin restricted mean, 
which is the mean of the survival time restricted to a given time 
point and is mathematically equivalent to the area under the 
survival curve up to the selected restriction time point.13 We 
then used the difference among the restricted mean survival 
times for these 4 events to examine the proportion of life lived 
with morbidity scores of 1, 2, and ≥3. Analyses were done 
overall and stratified by sex, morbidity status, and baseline age 
category (≤ 40, 41–50, >50 years).
Because medical costs are right skewed and heteroscedas-
tic, we used quantile regression to model the median and third 
quartile (75%) medical costs instead of the mean to determine 
whether individuals with favorable cardiovascular health profile 
have lower cumulative and average annual healthcare costs 
across the range of medical costs. SAS Proc Quantreg was 
used to fit the model. All models were adjusted for age, sex, 
race, education, and whether the individual died during follow-
up (in overall analyses). We also performed a subgroup analy-
sis among participants who had died during follow-up.
RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
This study included 25 
804 CHA participants, of whom 5.6% 
had favorable levels of all major cardiovascular risk factors 
at baseline, 19.0% had ≥1 elevated but no high levels, 
40.3% had 1 high level, and 35.1% had ≥2 high cardiovas-
cular risk factor levels (Table 2). Individuals with favorable 
cardiovascular health at baseline were younger, were more 
likely to be female, and had a higher education level.
Cardiovascular Health at Younger Ages and 
Morbidity at Older Ages
With poorer cardiovascular health at baseline, both all-
cause and cardiovascular morbidity scores were higher 
at age 65 and remained higher through age 90 (Figures 
II and III in the online-only Data Supplement).

When examining the cumulative burden of morbidity 
and the incidence of major morbidity, we restricted 
our analyses to the 17 939 participants with an all-
cause morbidity score of 0 at age 65 and 18 714 par-
ticipants with a cardiovascular morbidity score of 0 at 
age 65. Morbidity scores increased linearly with age 
(Figure 1 and Figures IV and V in the online-only Data 
Supplement), and individuals with a poorer cardiovas-
cular health at younger ages experienced higher all-
cause and cardiovascular morbidity scores from ages 
65 through 90. The cumulative morbidity as defined 
by the area under the morbidity curve (which is equiv-
alent to the sum of morbidity scores from ages 65 
through 90) was lower for those with all favorable risk 
factor levels (P<0.05; Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).

Morbidity-Free Survival and Compression of 
Morbidity
Being in favorable cardiovascular health significantly 
delayed the incidence of major all-cause and cardiovas-
cular morbidity by an average of 4.5 and 6.9 years, re-
spectively, compared with individuals with ≥2 high risk 
factors (Table I in the online-only Data Supplement and 
Figure 2). In addition to morbidity incidence, on average, 
individuals in favorable cardiovascular health lived 3.9 
years longer than those with ≥2 high risk factor levels. 
Similar patterns were seen for women and men (Figures 
VI and VII in the online-only Data Supplement).
Baseline cardiovascular health was associated with 
a significant relative compression of both all-cause and 
cardiovascular morbidity. The proportion of later life 
(life after age 65 years) lived with any all-cause mor-
bidity ranged from 39% for those with favorable car-
diovascular health at younger ages to 50% for those 
with ≥2 high risk factors and from 23% to 43% for car-
diovascular morbidity. We observed minimal absolute 
compression of all-cause morbidity. Regardless of risk 
factor strata, individuals lived on average 10 years with 
some all-cause morbidity (Table II in the online-only Data 
Supplement); however, the overall burden of major co-
morbidities that individuals experienced during these 10 
years was lower for those people who were in favorable 
cardiovascular health at baseline, as evidenced by the 
shorter duration of extremely high levels of morbidity 
(score ≥3; P<0.05 compared with individuals in favor-
able cardiovascular health). Compression of the abso-
lute number of years lived with morbidity was stronger 
among men, who lived almost 5 years longer without 
morbidity and 1 year less with morbidity (Figure VIA in 
the online-only Data Supplement).
In contrast to all-cause morbidity, cardiovascular 
health at younger ages was significantly associated with 
both absolute and relative compression of cardiovascu-
lar morbidity at older ages (Figure 2 and Tables II and III 
in the online-only Data Supplement). Similar to all-cause 
morbidity, men experienced a greater benefit in terms of 
the compression of morbidity than women (Table II in the 
online-only Data Supplement).
Medicare Costs
The differences in average and cumulative morbidity 
observed across cardiovascular health strata defined at 
younger ages translated to lower Medicare costs after 
age 65 among individuals in favorable cardiovascular 
health compared with those with ≥2 high risk factors 
(Table 3). Overall, there was a significant trend for in-
creased average annual costs and cumulative costs with 
greater risk factor burden (P for trend <0.001). When 
the analysis was restricted to individuals who died during 
follow-up, patterns were consistent, although there was 
some attenuation of the P values as a result of reduc-
tions in sample size.
Sensitivity Analyses 
Findings were consistent when limited to CHA partici-
pants who died during follow-up (Figure VIII and Table V 
in the online-only Data Supplement). After stratification 
by baseline age categories, similar patterns in the in-
cidence of morbidity and compression of morbidity 
across all 3 baseline age groups were observed (Figure 
IX–XI in the online-only Data Supplement). The only differ-
ence was in the oldest age group (baseline age >50 in 
1967–1973) in whom the cardiovascular health group 
with elevated but not high levels of cardiovascular risk 
factors had the longest life expectancy compared with 
those with favorable levels of all cardiovascular risk fac-
tors. This may be due to the existence of preexisting dis-
ease at baseline among this older group of participants. 
When risk factors were examined separately, the pres-
ence of each cardiovascular risk factor individually was 
associated with a higher cardiovascular morbidity score 
at each year of age from 65 throughout 90, resulting 
in a greater cumulative cardiovascular morbidity burden 
for the group with the risk factor compared with those 
without (Figure XII in the online-only Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
We found that cardiovascular health status, defined by 
the presence and severity of cardiovascular risk factors, 
in young adulthood and middle age is associated with 
the burden of all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity up 
to 43 years later. Individuals with favorable cardiovascu-
lar health at baseline experienced greater longevity and 
lower all-cause and cardiovascular morbidity throughout 
older age, resulting in lower morbidity levels at every 
age from 65 to 90 and ultimately lower cumulative mor-
bidity levels after age 65. These lower morbidity levels 
translated at the median into more than $5000 fewer 
dollars per year and almost $18 
000 fewer dollars cu-
mulatively being spent by CMS on health care from age 
65 on. In general, men experienced a greater benefit 
in terms of the compression of morbidity resulting from 
favorable cardiovascular health than women. Individuals 
in favorable cardiovascular health at younger ages not 
only live a longer life but live a healthier life and a greater 
proportion of life free of morbidity.
This study represents some of the first findings that 
favorable cardiovascular health in middle age is asso-
ciated with older age at incidence of major morbidity 
and lower cumulative levels of disability, as well as with 
healthy, not just greater, longevity. Our findings on the 
benefits of being in favorable cardiovascular health at 
younger ages considerably extend the observations of

prior research demonstrating a reduction in the incidence 
of specific CVDs, as well as cancer,14 depression,15 and 
higher cognitive functioning,16 along with other favorable 
outcomes. We found that an increasing burden of car-
diovascular risk factors was associated with a longer 
period of life lived with morbidity in a dose-dependent 
fashion, thus suggesting that any improvements in car-
diovascular health will likely translate to reductions in 
morbidity in older age.
Favorable cardiovascular health in middle age has 
previously been shown to be associated with increased 
longevity.17 The present study extends prior work to pro-

vide an understanding of not only how much longer in-
dividuals in favorable cardiovascular health live but also 
what proportion of that increase is due to an extension 
of healthy life as opposed to a longer life with more dis-
ability.
Beyond disease incidence and mortality, healthcare 
costs represent an important outcome for public health 
and policy makers. Among a smaller subset of CHA par-
ticipants followed up through 2004, favorable cardio-
vascular health has previously been found to be associ-
ated with reduced average annual costs and end-of-life 
costs.18,19 Our findings extend this work to a broader 
portion of the CHA cohort and demonstrate that lower 
morbidity scores among those who were in favorable 
cardiovascular health at baseline translates to lower av-
erage annual and cumulative costs up to 40 years later. 
These findings support prior literature demonstrating 
lower healthcare costs for individuals in better cardio-
vascular health in middle age.20
Less is known about favorable cardiovascular health 
in middle age and its effects on morbidity and mortality. 
Since Fries21 first described the theory of compression 
of morbidity in 1980, most work has focused on the role 
of health behaviors. Healthy lifestyle behaviors, that is, 
exercise, normal weight, and not smoking, have been 
shown to delay the onset of severe disability and to re-
duce cumulative disability.22 Also called healthy aging, 
the compression of morbidity paradigm suggests that 
prevention strategies may delay the onset of ill health 
to a greater degree than they delay date of death, thus 
resulting in a decreased proportion of life with morbidity. 
Until now, whether favorable cardiovascular health re-
sults in a compression of morbidity was unclear. A previ-
ous study done among the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project 
found that at younger index ages individuals in favorable 
cardiovascular health lived up to 14 years longer free of 
total CVD, although differences in survival after CVD inci-
dence were less dramatic.23 Our findings provide some 
of the first information directly testing whether favorable 
cardiovascular health is associated not only with an ex-
tension life and life lived free of morbidity but with an 
absolute and relative compression of morbidity.
This study has several important strengths, including 
the use of a large cohort of >25 
000 participants, all of 
whom were examined in person at baseline to measure 
cardiovascular risk factors objectively; >40 years of fol-
low-up with nearly complete ascertainment of morbidity 
with CMS Medicare files; and the inclusion of a large pro-
portion of participants who have been followed up to the 
end of their life, allowing us to estimate cumulative mor-
bidity and end of life costs. Despite these strengths, there 
are some limitations to consider. We have only a single 
baseline measure of cardiovascular risk factor profile and 
are unable to account for changes in risk factor levels or 
treatments over time. However, the impact of a single 
measure of cardiovascular health early in middle age has 
proven to be predictive of long-term outcomes in previ-
ous publications from CHA and in other cohorts.5,24–26 If 
anything, our findings are likely to be a conservative esti-
mate because single estimates of risk factor burden are 
an underestimation of the strength of the associations as 
a result of regression dilution bias. We lacked informa-

All costs are adjusted for age, sex, race, education, length of follow-up, and death during follow-up. Because of 
convergence issues, we used 75.5% and 50.5% quantiles in some models.

tion on other measures of socioeconomic status beyond 
income; however, in theory, all participants had equal ac-
cess to care given their enrollment in Medicare. We used 
CMS healthcare use files to identify morbidity, mortality, 
and cost outcomes and therefore we are able to examine 
only the 70% to 80% of the cohort enrolled in fee for 
service. We do not know the use for health maintenance 
organization users during years of health maintenance 
organization enrollment; however, risk factor level and 
morbidity status were not associated with health main-
tenance organization enrollment (data not shown), and 
thus, this bias should be nondifferential, leading us to 
underestimate the strength of our associations. We lack 
outcomes before age 65 and must use International Clas-
sification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes to determine 
morbidity. Those codes have been shown to be reliable 
for the conditions included in the comorbidity scores in 
this study and have been used for a multitude of clinical 
investigations. General agreement between comorbidity 
scores derived from administrative data and chart review 
has been >85%.27 Given the reliability of these scores 
and their well-documented association with mortality, 
physical functioning, and health-related quality of life, the 
Gagne comorbidity score serves as a valid and reliable 
measure of morbidity in older age.11,28–30
CONCLUSIONS
We found that individuals in favorable cardiovascular 
health in early middle age have lower levels of morbidity, 
both all-cause and cardiovascular, up to 40 years later in 
life and experience a lower cumulative morbidity burden 
translating to reduced average annual healthcare costs. 
Our findings have important implications for prevention. 
At the individual level, living a longer and healthier life 
free of major morbidity can provide strong motivation to 
maintain and improve cardiovascular health across the 
life span. At the population and healthcare system levels, 
these findings directly support the need to improve pre-
vention efforts and to target them earlier in life, before 
the development of adverse risk factor levels (ie, primor-
dial prevention). Our data suggest that the resultant re-
ductions in morbidity could translate to large savings in 
healthcare spending at the national level.
