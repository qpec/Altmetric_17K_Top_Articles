T
he European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) pro-
vides recommendations for diagnostic strategies and prophylac-
tic, pre-emptive or targeted therapy strategies for various types of
infection in patients with hematologic malignancies or hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation recipients. Meetings are held every two years
since 2005 and evidence-based recommendations are elaborated after
evaluation of the literature and discussion among specialists of nearly all
European countries. In this manuscript, the ECIL group presents the
2015-update of the recommendations for the targeted treatment of inva-
sive candidiasis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Current data now
allow a very strong recommendation in favor of echinocandins for 
first-line therapy of candidemia irrespective of the underlying predis-
posing factors. Anidulafungin has been given the same grading as the
other echinocandins for hemato-oncological patients. The beneficial
role of catheter removal in candidemia is strengthened. Aspergillus guide-
lines now recommend the use of either voriconazole or isavuconazole
for first-line treatment of invasive aspergillosis, while first-line combina-
tion antifungal therapy is not routinely recommended. As only few new
data were published since the last ECIL guidelines, no major changes
were made to mucormycosis recommendations.

ABSTRACT
Introduction
The European Conference on Infections in Leukemia (ECIL) is the result of a col-
laboration between the European Organization for Research and Treatment of
Cancer (EORTC), the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation
(EBMT), the European Leukemia Net (ELN), and the International
Immunocompromised Host Society (ICSH). First recommendations for the treat-
ment of Candida and Aspergillus infections in hematologic patients were published
in 2007 after the first conference (ECIL-1) and have then been updated at ECIL-2
and ECIL-3.1,2 First recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of mucormy-
cosis have been published after ECIL-3.3 ECIL-4 updates for antifungal therapy were
only available as slides on the websites of these participating societies without pub-
lication of a manuscript in consideration of the lack of substantial new data and the
 limited modifications compared to the latest publication.
With respect to the targeted treatment of fungal infec-
tions, the goals for ECIL-5 were to update the recommen-
dations with analysis of the new data for invasive candidi-
asis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis in hematologic
patients. The update was also necessary to change the
prior 5-level grading (A to E) used during the ECILs 1 to 4
for the strength of recommendations for Candida and
Aspergillus infections into the 3-level grading (A to C)
already used during ECIL-3 for the first recommendation
for mucormycosis (Table 1).1-3 The grading for quality of
evidence has not been modified.
Methods
The ECIL-5 meeting was held in September 2013 and involved
57 experts from 21 countries, including 3 non-European countries.
Slides of the conclusions of the ECIL-5 were made available on the
websites of the EORTC, EBMT, ELN, and ICHS. The ECIL-6
meeting was held in September 2015 with the presence of 55
experts from 24 countries, including 4 non-European countries (see
list of collaborators at the end of this Review).
At both the ECIL-5 and the ECIL-6 meetings, the antifungal
therapy working group made a search for new publications
regarding treatment of invasive candidiasis, aspergillosis and
mucormycosis. The group was divided into three subgroups, each
being responsible for one of each fungal infection type. The litera-
ture search was performed in Pubmed and Cochrane databases.
Abstracts presented at major congresses during the previous two
years were also retrieved and integrated into the ECIL recommen-
dation. All recommendations referring to an abstract, however,
were classified as provisional until the publication of the final
manuscript. 
The working group presented its recommendations during the
plenary session at the ECIL-5 meeting and then incorporated the
suggestions coming from the assembly. In cases in which full con-
sensus was not obtained, the decision was put to the vote, and the
final decision was based on a majority of votes from the full ECIL-
5 assembly. The updated recommendations were presented on the
next day during a second plenary session for final approval.
Recommendations were graded on the basis of the strength of rec-
ommendations (3-level scale: A, B, or C) and quality of evidence
(3-level scale: I, II, or III), as detailed in Table 1. 
The manuscript of the ECIL-5 was put on hold after a debate
arose on differences between ECIL and European Society for
Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (ESCMID) /
European Confederation of Medical Mycology (ECMM) recom-
mendations on guidelines for prophylaxis and treatment of inva-
sive aspergillosis (draft presented at the ECCMID 2014).4 Two
joint meetings were subsequently held (December 2014 and April
2015) to identify the differences and the exact reasons for these
differences. The aim was not to modify the recommendations
made by each of the two groups but rather to add explanations on
the differences in the manuscript. For further clarification, a joint
presentation was given at the ECIL-6 by members of the ECIL
group and of the ESCMID/ECMM group. This resulted in a delay
in publication of the ECIL-5 recommendations and during the
ECIL-6 plenary session, the ECIL assembly approved a new search
for publications or abstracts until September 2015 with inclusion
of all relevant data on aspergillosis, candidiasis and mucormycosis
for a full update of the guidelines. Final approval by the majority
of the members of the group was obtained in Autumn 2015. The
current manuscript includes updates from both the ECIL-5 and the
ECIL-6 and is called “ECIL-6 guidelines for the treatment of inva-
sive candidiasis, aspergillosis and mucormycosis in leukemia and
hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients”. 
Invasive candidiasis
Like previous ECIL recommendations, the current
guidelines for invasive candidiasis cover the hematologic
population as well as the general population of patients.
Although hematologic patients are the main focus of the
recommendation, this distinction is maintained because
available data from the original randomized controlled tri-
als mainly include non-neutropenic patients. Chronic
infections are not considered. Twenty-two major publica-
tions were identified (Tables 2 and 3).5-26 Fifteen reported
primary results from clinical trials.5-11,13-17,19,20 One publica-
tion analyzed results of a subgroup of cancer patients from
a previously published trial.12 One publication reported the
analysis of pooled data from 2 trials previously published
with a focus on patients with an underlying malignancy.21
All these studies were published before the ECIL-4. Since
then, 5 studies have been identified, including one patient-
level quantitative review of 7 published trials on invasive
candidiasis, one pooled patient-level data analysis from 5
prospective trials on anidulafungin, one systematic review
of 17 randomized clinical trials focusing on invasive can-
didiasis in neutropenic patients, one prospective non-com-
parative trial evaluating a strategy of early oral switch
from anidulafungin for invasive candidiasis, and one
observational study comparing the initial use of
echinocandin-based versus
azole-based regimen for 
C. parapsilosis candidemia.22-26 These publications were the
reasons for the change in guidelines. Characteristics of
these studies and main results are shown in Tables 2 and
3.
The number of neutropenic patients included in each of
these studies was low and limited the level of evidence of
the recommendation for this group of patients. The
review published by Andes et al. showed that, in the uni-
variate analysis, neutropenia was one of the factors signif-
icantly and negatively associated both with clinical out-
come and with survival.22 In the multivariate analysis,
however, the effect of neutropenia disappeared, but there
was a significant association of immunosuppressive ther-
apy (including steroids) with lower survival. Other factors
significantly associated with lower survival were the
APACHE score, infection by C. tropicalis and age, while
treatment with an echinocandin [Odds Ratio (OR) 0.65,
95%CI: 0.45-0.94; P=0.02] and catheter removal were
both significantly associated with better survival (OR 0.50,
95%CI: 0.35-0.72; P=0.0001).
Based on the patient-level quantitative analysis by
Andes et al., echinocandins must be considered as first-line
choice for invasive Candida infections before species iden-
tification (Table 4).22 The strength of recommendation is
the same (A) for anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafun-
gin and is also the same for the overall and the hematolog-
ic population. However, the quality of evidence is lower
for hematologic patients (II) compared to the overall pop-
ulation, as the number of neutropenic patients recruited in
the clinical trials was low. A recent communication on a
patient-level pooled analysis of one randomized clinical
trial and 4 open label studies focusing on anidulafungin in
46 neutropenic patients with candidemia showed compa-
rable response and survival rates to those observed with
caspofungin and micafungin in other studies.25 Therefore,
the grading is now similar (A II) for all three echinocandins
F. Tissot et al.

 for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in hematologic
patients. 
Liposomal amphotericin B has also been graded A I for
the overall population and A II for hematologic patients
due to similar efficacy in comparison to micafungin.15,21
However, its safety profile is less favorable and therefore
liposomal amphotericin B should be considered as an
alternative in case of contraindication to echinocandins.
Fluconazole and voriconazole are potential alternatives for
first-line treatment in the overall population provided
there is no previous exposure to azoles and the infection is
not severe (fluconazole).
After species identification, susceptibility testing should
guide the treatment. In general, echinocandins remain the
drug of choice, except for C. parapsilosis where fluconazole
is more appropriate (Table 5). However, a recent observa-
tional study reported no difference in 30-day mortality
and persistent candidemia at 72 hours of an echinocandin-
based regimen compared to an azole-based therapy for
patients with C. parapsilosis candidemia.26 Therefore, the
continuing use of echinocandins might be considered in
patients with a clinical and microbiological response.
When Candida species is azole-susceptible, step-down to
fluconazole can be considered in stable patients after five
days of intravenous (iv) therapy.24 In patients with Candida
krusei infection, switch to oral voriconazole is an option.
Although the role of catheter removal in the manage-
ment of candidemia has long been controversial, most
recent 
studies 
suggest 
a 
beneficial 
effect 
on 
outcome.6-8,10,11,15,16,20,26-33 Garnacho-Montero et al. showed in
a large number of candidemia that early adequate therapy
and removal of central venous line were independently
associated with lower mortality.34 The patient-level quan-
titative analysis by Andes et al. also demonstrated in a
multivariate analysis that removal of catheter was associ-
ated with a decreased mortality (OR 0.50; 95%CI: 0.35-
0.72; P=0.0001).22 The recommendation is, therefore, to
rapidly remove the catheter in the overall population
(grade A II) as well as in hematologic patients (grade B II)
irrespective of the Candida species. If central venous
catheter cannot be removed, treatment should include an
echinocandin or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B due
to their better activity on Candida biofilms.35-37
Invasive Aspergillus infections
Nine prospective trials (only 4 being randomized com-
parative trials) had been published before the ECIL-4 and
provided the basis of the previous guidelines for first-line
therapy in invasive aspergillosis (Table 6).38-46 An additional
paper reported a post-hoc analysis of the trial comparing
standard dose of liposomal amphotericin B to high-dose
liposomal amphotericin B.47 This post-hoc analysis com-
paring outcome in possible versus mycologically docu-
mented aspergillosis underscored the limited number of
mycologically documented infections but did not lead to
any change in the grading for liposomal amphotericin B. A
second post-hoc analysis was performed on the voricona-
zole versus amphotericin B deoxycholate trial.48 Integration
of the results of baseline galactomannan detection tests
performed after primary analysis and re-categorization
according to the 2008 EORTC/MSG definition criteria
allowed more mycologically documented cases of inva-
sive aspergillosis to be identified.49 Conclusions of this
post-hoc analysis were similar to those of the primary
analysis and therefore its results did not affect the grading
for voriconazole and for amphotericin B deoxycholate.

The results have been discussed with a provisional grad-
ing that could be transformed in a definite grading, as no
additional data available in the full paper suggested a
need for change in provisional recommendations.50 This
study failed to reach the primary endpoint of decreased
all-cause mortality at week 6 (difference of -8.2% in favor
of combination; P=0.087). However, in a subgroup of
patients with an invasive aspergillosis documented by
positive galactomannan in either serum or bronchoalveo-
lar lavage, 6-week all-cause mortality was lower in
patients receiving combination therapy (difference of -
11.6% in favor of combination; P=0.037). A large majori-
ty of the ECIL members felt that this subgroup analysis,
that had not been originally planned, was not sufficient to
give a stronger recommendation although this subgroup
included 80% of the modified intent-to-treat population.
Therefore, the combination of voriconazole plus anidula-
fungin was graded C I for primary therapy of invasive
aspergillosis while all other combinations were graded C
III in the absence of well-designed studies for first-line
therapy.
Table 6 summarizes the main characteristics and results
of the various studies. Importantly, very few studies had
a large number of patients with a mycological documen-
tation.40,41,50 As shown by the 2 post-hoc analyses, survival
was substantially lower in mycologically-documented
infections compared to possible cases.47,48 Therefore, stud-
ies with a limited number of documented cases cannot
lead to the strongest recommendations. As no study
specifically addressed management of breakthrough
aspergillosis after failure of posaconazole or voriconazole
prophylaxis, no recommendation could be made on this
issue.
The clinical trial comparing the new triazole isavucona-
zole versus voriconazole for primary therapy of invasive
aspergillosis could not be discussed during the ECIL-5 as
results were only presented as an abstract in 2014.
However, the group could review the data from these
abstracts during the ECIL-6 meeting. Isavuconazole
appears to be as effective as voriconazole for the treat-
ment of invasive aspergillosis and has a better safety pro-
file. Therefore, a grade A I similar to the grading for
voriconazole has been given to isavuconazole (Table 7).
As the full paper was published shortly after the meeting,
and confirms the results, the provisional grading attrib-
uted during the meeting has been transformed into a def-
inite grading in this manuscript.51
Currently, amphotericin B deoxycholate is considered to
have no role in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis
when more effective and less toxic agents are available. Its
limited efficacy and its poor safety profile led to a recom-
mendation against its use. No substantial change has been
made for second-line therapy in the absence of new data
(Table 8).
Mucormycosis
Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies were discussed dur-
ing the ECIL-5 and the ECIL-6. Rhizopus, Mucor, Lichtheimia
(previously 
classified 
as 
Absidia), 
Cunninghamella,
Rhizomucor, Apophysomyces, and Saksenaea are the genera
most 
frequently 
involved 
in 
human 
disease.52
Cunninghamella species is more virulent in experimental
models and may be associated with a higher mortality rate
in patients.53 So far, there has not been enough evidence that
identification of mucormycosis to the genus and/or species
level helps guide antifungal treatment.54,55 Species identifica-
tion remains, nevertheless, important for outbreak investi-
gations.56 However, the differentiation between mucormy-
cosis and other invasive mold infection is of critical impor-
tance as it has major therapeutic implications. 
While epidemiological aspects and some clinical (sinus
disease, concomitant diabetes, occurrence under voricona-
zole therapy) and radiological (reverse halo sign on chest
CT-scan) factors may help to suspect mucormycosis, the
diagnosis remains difficult and biopsy of the lesion is often
required. Identification of the pathogen most often comes
from microscopic, culture and/or histopathological exam-
ination of relevant samples. New diagnostic approaches
include molecular testing on serum and various other clin-
ical samples including formalin-fixed tissues, MALDI-TOF
and Mucorales-specific T-cell detection.57-64 Although these
new approaches are very promising for an earlier diagno-
sis, no grading for their use can be given yet due to the
lack of data.
Amphotericin B, posaconazole and isavuconazole are
the most potent agents in vitro.65-67 Currently, no validated
minimum inhibitory concentration breakpoints for any of
the drugs are available and thus determination of suscepti-
bility categories is not possible for the agents of mucormy-
cosis. The ECIL-3 recommendations for the treatment of
mucormycosis were mostly based on retrospective studies,
registry data and small prospective non-controlled stud-
ies.3,68-77 Few new data are available for the treatment of
mucormycosis since the ECIL 4 and, therefore, the current
recommendations are very similar (Table 9).

 A prospective non-comparative trial assessed the effica-
cy and safety of first-line therapy with high-dose liposo-
mal amphotericin B given at 10 mg/kg/day combined with
surgery when appropriate.78 This trial demonstrated effi-
cacy of high-dose liposomal amphotericin B plus surgery
in mucormycosis with a survival rate of 62% at week 12.
The only factor associated with mortality was the pres-
ence of hematologic malignancy or cancer (HR: 3.15;
95%CI: 1.12-8.91; P=0.02). Renal impairment of any
degree was observed in 40% of the patients but was tran-
sient in most of them. These results confirm the beneficial
role of liposomal amphotericin B but do not yet allow any
recommendation for the administration of such a high
dose of 10 mg/kg/day.
A short paper presented data from a retrospective analy-
sis of a combination of posaconazole and a lipid formula-
tion of amphotericin B.79 Thirty-two patients received this
combination of posaconazole with liposomal ampho-

Only 3 of them were treated with this combination in first
line. Overall response rate was 56% but a large proportion
of patients (59%) died before day 90. The low number of
patients, the retrospective nature of the study, and the
high mortality rate at day 90 only allowed for a B III rec-
ommendation for this combination for salvage therapy of
mucormycosis (Table 10). 
Discussion and conclusions
An update of the ECIL antifungal treatment recommen-
dations was needed as there were important new data,
and also because of necessary changes in the ECIL grading
system so as to be in harmony with other ECIL recom-
mendations. The most important data for invasive can-
didiasis came from a large review of patients included in 7

 major trials.22 The multivariate analysis now allows a very
strong recommendation in favor of an echinocandin for
the first-line therapy of candidemia irrespective of the
underlying predisposing factors. The controversy on the
beneficial role of catheter removal can now be considered
to be resolved. The most interesting new data were the
publication of a first-line combination study in invasive
aspergillosis and the results of a randomized comparative
trial comparing isavuconazole to voriconazole. Aspergillus
guidelines now include the results of these 2 clinical trials
and should help clinicians in their treatment decision mak-
ing. Since few new data have been published since the last
ECIL guidelines, no major changes were made to
mucormycosis management. Importantly, the posology
and indication of antifungal agents reported in the current
guidelines do not necessarily reflect those licensed by the
European Medicines Agency (EMA), but are the result of a
consensus-based analysis of available literature within the
ECIL group.
There has been controversy about some discrepancies
between the ECIL-5 and the ESCMID recommendations
for invasive aspergillosis in hematologic patients. These
differences were identified during a joint meeting and an
ESCMID representative was invited to discuss them at
the ECIL-6 meeting. Most differences were minor and
mostly reflected a difference in grading system. The ECIL
Aspergillus recommendations are restricted to hematolog-
ic patients who represent more than 90% of the patients
included in the major clinical trials.41,43,50,51 No subgroup of
hematologic patients deserving specific recommendation
for Aspergillus infection treatment has been identified by
the ECIL group. In contrast, the ESCMID group had a
broader approach considering all other conditions predis-
posing to invasive aspergillosis, grading the diagnostic
procedures, and including environmental measures in the
prevention, also providing a grade for specific infection
sites. In addition, the ESCMID group also segregated the
hematologic patients into subgroups and provided spe-
cific grading for each of them, with usually weaker rec-
ommendations when there was not a sufficient number
of patients with these specific underlying conditions
included in the clinical studies. Finally, and importantly,
some data were not available at the time of the ECIL-5
meeting but were in the public domain when the
ESCMID group met. In September 2015, the ECIL-6
group was able to incorporate the new data, and this has
helped to reduce the apparent differences with the
ESCMID guidelines. Therefore, neither the ECIL group
nor the ESCMID group felt any change other than this
update was required.
