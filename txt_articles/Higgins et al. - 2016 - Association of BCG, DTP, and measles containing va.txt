ABSTRACT
ObjeCtives
To evaluate the effects on non-specific and all cause 
mortality, in children under 5, of Bacillus Calmette-
Guérin (BCG), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), and 
standard titre measles containing vaccines (MCV); 
to examine internal validity of the studies; and to 
examine any modifying effects of sex, age, vaccine 
sequence, and co-administration of vitamin A.
Design
Systematic review, including assessment of risk of 
bias, and meta-analyses of similar studies.
stuDy eligibility Criteria
Clinical trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies 
of the effects on mortality of BCG, whole cell DTP, and 
standard titre MCV in children under 5.
Data sOurCes
Searches of Medline, Embase, Global Index Medicus, 
and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry 
Platform, supplemented by contact with experts in the 
field. To avoid overlap in children studied across the 
included articles, findings from non-overlapping birth 
cohorts were identified.
results
Results from 34 birth cohorts were identified. Most 
evidence was from observational studies, with some 
from short term clinical trials. Most studies reported 
on all cause (rather than non-specific) mortality. 
Receipt of BCG vaccine was associated with a 
reduction in all cause mortality: the average relative 
risks were 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.49 to 1.01) 
from five clinical trials and 0.47 (0.32 to 0.69) from 
nine observational studies at high risk of bias. Receipt 
of DTP (almost always with oral polio vaccine) was 
associated with a possible increase in all cause 
mortality on average (relative risk 1.38, 0.92 to 2.08) 
from 10 studies at high risk of bias; this effect seemed 
stronger in girls than in boys. Receipt of standard titre 
MCV was associated with a reduction in all cause 
mortality (relative risks 0.74 (0.51 to 1.07) from four 
clinical trials and 0.51 (0.42 to 0.63) from 18 
observational studies at high risk of bias); this effect 
seemed stronger in girls than in boys. Seven 
observational studies, assessed as being at high risk 
of bias, have compared sequences of vaccines; results 
of a subset of these suggest that administering DTP 
with or after MCV may be associated with higher 
mortality than administering it before MCV.
COnClusiOns
 Evidence suggests that receipt of BCG and MCV reduce 
overall mortality by more than would be expected 
through their effects on the diseases they prevent, and 
receipt of DTP may be associated with an increase in 
all cause mortality. Although efforts should be made to 
ensure that all children are immunised on schedule 
with BCG, DTP, and MCV, randomised trials are needed 
to compare the effects of different sequences.
Introduction
An increasing number of vaccines targeting some of the 
leading causes of morbidity and mortality are reaching 
the world’s children. Although vaccines such as those 
against measles, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), and 
polio are widely understood to have reduced the burden 
of the diseases they target, studies have suggested that 
some of the vaccines routinely administered to infants 
and children also affect the risk of illness and death from 
conditions other than the specific infectious diseases 
they are designed to prevent.1 
2  Among hypotheses con-
cerning these “non-specific effects” of vaccines are that, 
under some circumstances, some vaccines (for example, 
measles and Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)) lower sub-
sequent risk, whereas others (such as DTP) increase sub-
sequent risk of illness and death from other causes. It is 
further postulated that the magnitude of these effects 
depends on other factors, including sex and vitamin A 
supplementation status. The potential for non-specific 
vaccine effects has led some authors to question whether 
the vaccination schedules currently recommended by the 
World Health Organization should be modified.3

WhAT IS AlReAdy knoWn on ThIS TopIC
Vaccines such as those against measles, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP), and 
polio have produced extraordinary reductions in the diseases they target
Some routinely administered vaccines are proposed to have non-specific effects on 
mortality from conditions other than the infectious diseases they are designed to 
prevent
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
A comprehensive systematic review and risk of bias assessment found few 
randomised trials and determined that many types of bias may have influenced 
the results of the many observational studies
Receipt of BCG and measles containing vaccines may reduce overall mortality by 
more than expected through their effects on the diseases they prevent, and receipt 
of DTP may be associated with higher all cause mortality
The evidence does not support a change to existing vaccination recommendations 
but does indicate a need for randomised trials to examine the positioning of DTP in 
the vaccine schedule
Until the results of such studies are available, every effort should be made to 
ensure that infants receive routine immunisations on schedule and in the sequence 
recommended by WHO.

WHO recommends that BCG should be administered 
as soon as possible after birth, that whole cell DTP 
should be administered after six weeks, with two fur-
ther doses at intervals of four to eight weeks, and that 
measles containing vaccines (MCV) be administered at 
nine to 12 months, with a further dose given at least four 
weeks later.3 We aimed to quantify the effects of these 
three vaccines on mortality from causes other than 
those the vaccine is designed to prevent and on all 
cause mortality. Randomised trials testing these effects 
have been difficult or impossible to conduct. As a result, 
many of the studies testing these hypotheses have been 
observational in nature. We therefore included both 
randomised trials and observational studies and aimed 
also to evaluate the potential for bias in the available 
evidence.
Methods
study eligibility and selection
We followed a protocol that was published online in 
advance5 ; further details of study methods have subse-
quently been published.6 We sought clinical trials (ran-
domised or quasi-randomised), cohort studies, and 
case-control studies comparing children who were and 
were not given one of the three vaccines. Studies in which 
there was simultaneous administration of another vac-
cine were eligible. Studies had to report mortality data 
for children up to 5 years of age. We excluded children 
who had received medium or high titre MCV, as these are 
not currently used. We restricted eligibility to primary 
research articles (published or unpublished), reanalyses 
of primary studies reported in methodological articles, 
and follow-up commentaries and letters written by the 
authors of the original studies. We excluded results avail-
able only in reviews and meta-analyses, as well as com-
mentaries or letters not written by study authors.
We searched Medline and Embase (to November 2012 
with no restriction on start date), Global Index Medicus 
(to March 2013), and the WHO International Clinical Tri-
als Registry Platform (to March 2013). The search strat-
egy is available in an online supplement (appendix 1). 
Searches were supplemented by contact with experts in 
the field. Search results were uploaded to a web based 
system (DistillerSR, www.systematic-review.ca). Titles 
and abstracts were inspected independently by two 
reviewers, and the full text of potentially relevant arti-
cles was obtained. Articles underwent two phases of 
inspection, in each case by two reviewers working inde-
pendently. Discrepancies were resolved by a principal 
investigator.
Data collection and management
Two reviewers collected data independently, using a 
data extraction form within the web based system. Fur-
ther data collection was done by a statistician, focusing 
on extraction of mortality outcome data. In addition to 
studies’ characteristics, we collected adjusted and 
unadjusted relative risk estimates and all available 
effect measures stratified by sex (or computed them 
where the required information was reported) and by 
receipt or not of vitamin A supplementation.
Considerable overlap existed in children studied 
across the included articles, so multiple results were 
available for some groups of children. To avoid double 
counting, we grouped children into birth cohorts by 
geographical location and time period, and we grouped 
all articles relating to the same birth cohort. We devised 
an algorithm to select one primary result for each vac-
cine from each birth cohort (appendix 2). This favoured 
results relating to vaccination received according to the 
sequence implied by WHO recommendations (BCG at 
birth, then DTP, then MCV), comparisons of adminis-
tration versus no administration of the vaccine, ran-
domised comparisons, general population cohorts, 
adjusted estimates, and larger sample sizes. We applied 
the same principles to extract data for examining inter-
actions and making comparisons of sequences; there 
was substantially less multiplicity for these results, 
although effect estimates had to be computed from 
available results to make the desired comparisons of 
vaccine sequences.
risk of bias assessment
We used the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias in 
clinical trials.7  For observational studies, we used a 
new tool that is motivated by considerations of causal 
inference in epidemiology,8  additionally informed by 
methodological considerations specific to this research 
area.9 
10  We pre-specified potential confounders as age 
and sex of the child, child’s health (including nutritional 
status and birth weight), and socioeconomic status 
(including poverty, education, and hygiene conditions) 
and potentially important co-interventions as malaria 
interventions, de-worming, micronutrient supplements, 
breast feeding, hygiene programmes, and other vacci-
nations. We assessed risks of bias in seven domains, 
facilitated by consideration of pertinent “signalling” 
questions, including definition of vaccination status, 
likelihood of subsequent vaccinations, and use of land-
mark or retrospective approaches to analysis.9 Within 
each domain, we rated risk of bias as “low” (comparable 
to a well performed randomised trial), “moderate” (sound 
for an observational study), “high” (there are important 
problems), or “very high” (the study is too problematic 
to provide useful evidence). We excluded results of stud-
ies at very high a risk of bias from syntheses, and they do 
not contribute to our conclusions. We used the same 
categories for risk of bias in clinical trials.
statistical methods
We estimated a relative risk for each independent birth 
cohort (measured using hazard ratio, rate ratio, risk 
ratio, or odds ratio, in order of preference), computed 
from summary statistics and subgroups where neces-
sary. When combining information across subgroups 
within a birth cohort, we used fixed effect meta-analy-
sis. When combining information across overlapping 
analyses, we averaged the effect size and its variance 
(on the log scale). We used methods described by Green-
land and Longnecker when we used a different reference 
group from that originally reported.11  Results in forest 
plots are relative risk estimates and 95% confidence

intervals. Meta-analyses used standard fixed effect and 
random effects inverse variance weighted averages with 
a moment estimate of between studies variance,12 sepa-
rately for clinical trials and observational studies, with 
the extent of inconsistency measured using I2 statistics 
and between study heterogeneity represented in predic-
tion intervals.13  We present mean effects from random 
effects analyses in the text. Sensitivity analyses using 
alternative meta-analysis approaches are presented in 
online supplementary material. Each meta-analysis 
included too few studies for funnel plots and associated 
tests to be informative.14
To examine differences in vaccine effect by sex, we 
computed within study interactions as the difference 
between the vaccine effects for boys and girls or as the 
difference between sex effects for vaccinated and 
unvaccinated children. We took a similar approach to 
examine differential vaccine effects by vitamin A sup-
plementation status. In further analyses, we considered 
various sequences of vaccines, to examine outcomes 
when the usual sequence of vaccines had been compared 
with alternatives (simultaneous administration of BCG 
and DTP, BCG after DTP, BCG with or after DTP, simulta-
neous administration of DTP and MCV, DTP after MCV, 
DTP with or after MCV).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for design or implementation of the 
study. No patients were asked to advise on interpreta-
tion or writing up of results. There are no plans to dis-
seminate the results of the research to study participants 
or the relevant patient community.
Results
included studies
Detailed results of the review are available elsewhere.6 
 
We included 68 articles reporting results for the effects of 
the three vaccines on overall mortality, originating from 
34 birth cohorts (fig 1). Twenty one cohorts were from 
Africa (including eight cohorts (described in 37 articles) 
from Guinea Bissau and four (in four articles) from Sene-
gal), three were from North America, eight from south or 
southeast Asia, one from Papua New Guinea, and one 
from Haiti. For effects on overall mortality, we identified 
18 results (17 birth cohorts) for BCG vaccine, 17 results (17 
birth cohorts) for DTP vaccine, and 29 results (27 birth 
cohorts) for MCV. Five results for BCG vaccine were from 
clinical trials, as were four results for MCV. Three, zero, 
and seven articles reported results for non-specific mor-
tality for BCG, DTP, and MCV, respectively. Characteristics 
of the birth cohorts contributing data for each vaccine are 
available in an online supplement (appendix 3), along 
with a brief summary of excluded studies (appendix 4).
risk of bias in included studies
Methodological features and assessments of risk of bias 
are presented in an online supplement (appendix 5). Of 
the nine clinical trial results, we judged two for BCG to be 
at low risk of bias and the other seven (three for BCG and 
four for MCV) to be at moderate risk of bias. All of the 
results from observational studies were judged to be at 
high risk of bias (that is, there are important problems) or 
at very high risk of bias (that is, too problematic to pro-
vide useful evidence). The main potential sources of risk 
of bias were confounding (no studies were considered to 
have overcome this, particularly as sicker children are 
less likely to be vaccinated); misclassification bias relat-
ing to determination of non-vaccination status; bias aris-
ing from selection of participants after vaccines were 
received (therefore, after they could have affected mortal-
ity); co-interventions, including administration of other 
vaccines covered by the review; and misclassification 
bias relating to lack of information about vaccinations 
administered (including “survival bias” arising from a 
retrospective approach to the analysis being taken). We 
regard the estimates of interaction (for example, for dif-
ferences by sex) to be much less affected by bias, because 
we expect that the biases affecting direct estimates of 
vaccine effects are likely to be similar across subgroups 
within a study (for example, similar in boys and girls).
effect of bCg vaccine on overall mortality
Five clinical trials, 12 cohort studies, and one case- 
control study compared mortality rates among BCG 
vaccinated and BCG non-vaccinated children (fig 2).

We considered four results from cohort studies to be 
at very high risk of bias and excluded them from 
meta-analyses. The clinical trial results, including two 
at low risk of bias in low birthweight infants and two in 
Native American children in the 1930s and 40s, sug-
gested a beneficial effect of BCG on mortality (average 
relative risk 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 1.01). 
The clinical trials in low birthweight infants, which 
were the two studies judged to be at low risk of bias, 
gave a combined relative risk of 0.52 (0.33 to 0.82). The 
average relative risk for the nine observational studies 
(follow-up mostly within the first year of life) was 0.47 
(0.32 to 0.69; inconsistency (I2)=63%), although all 
these studies were considered to be at high risk of bias. 
Results did not change materially when we used differ-
ent statistical methods (appendix 6).
effect of DtP vaccine on overall mortality
Sixteen cohort studies and one case-control study com-
pared receipt of DTP with no DTP (fig 3 ). Oral polio vac-
cine was known to be administered concomitantly with 
DTP in most studies; three studies did not report co- 
administration of oral polio vaccone.15 
16 
17 No clinical tri-
als were identified. We considered seven results from 
cohort studies to be at very high risk of bias and excluded 
them from meta-analyses. The remaining 10 studies pro-
duced diverse results (I2=71%), ranging from halving of to 
fourfold increase in mortality risk. Most studies indicated 
that receipt of DTP was associated with higher mortality, 
and three individual results had 95% confidence intervals 
that excluded no effect (one lower mortality, two higher 
mortality). The average relative risk was 1.38 (0.92 to 2.08) 
among these 10 studies, all assessed as being at high risk 
of bias. Results did not change materially when we used 
different statistical methods (appendix 6). The mortality 
rate was very high among unvaccinated children in the 
Papua New Guinea study,18 and two referees had notable 
concerns about this study. Excluding it from the 
meta-analysis gave a relative risk of 1.36 (1.09 to 1.68).
effect of MCv on overall mortality
Four (randomised) clinical trials, 23 cohort studies, and 
two case-control studies compared children who had or 
had not received MCV (fig 4). We considered seven 
results from cohort studies to be at very high risk of bias 
and excluded them from meta-analyses. In three clini-
cal trials in Guinea-Bissau, we limited follow-up to nine 
months, at which point children in the control group 
received MCV. Owing to the short follow-up, numbers of 
deaths were low and the findings inconclusive. Direc-
tions of effect in these trials, as well as in a fourth clini-
cal trial in Nigeria, pointed towards a beneficial effect of 
receipt of MCV (relative risk 0.74, 0.51 to 1.07; I2=0%). 
The 18 observational studies that were not excluded 
consistently provided estimates indicating that MCV 
was associated with lower mortality within the first two 
to five years of life, with average halving of mortality 
risk (relative risk 0.51, 0.42 to 0.63; I2=64%). We consid-
ered all of these studies to be at high risk of bias. Results 
did not change materially when we used different statis-
tical methods (appendix 6). Results after deaths from 
measles were removed or censored (not shown here; see 
full report for details6) suggested that these effects, if 
real, were not fully explained by deaths due to measles.
effects of different vaccine sequences on 
overall mortality
We compared the standard vaccination sequence (BCG 
followed by DTP followed by MCV) with variants in 
which BCG was received either with or after DTP or DTP 
was received either with or after MCV (fig 5 ). Three cohort 
studies compared DTP received simultaneously with BCG 
against DTP after BCG (P Aaby, unpublished manu-
script).19 
20 They suggested that simultaneous adminis-
tration may be associated with lower mortality (relative 
risk 0.52, 0.34 to 0.80; I2=0%). Three studies compared 
BCG received after DTP against DTP after BCG (P Aaby, 
unpublished manuscript).19 
20  No clear differences were 
apparent. These three studies, plus one other reporting 
on two different age groups,18 compared receipt of BCG 
vaccine with or after DTP against DTP after BCG. The 
summary effect was a relative risk of 0.60 (0.42 to 0.86). 
We considered all these 11 results to be at high risk of 
bias, and five of them were not adjusted for age.
Five cohort studies compared DTP received simultane-
ously with MCV against MCV received after DTP.19 
20 
21 
22 
23 
Their results suggested that simultaneous administration 
may be associated with higher mortality (relative risk 2.29, 
1.55 to 3.37; I2=0%). Results of three studies that compared 
DTP after MCV against the standard sequence19 
20 
22 sug-
gested that receiving DTP after MCV may be associated 
with higher mortality (relative risk 2.66, 1.04 to 6.81; 
I2=57%). Five studies provided results for a comparison of 
DTP with or after MCV against MCV after DTP (relative risk 
2.34, 1.57 to 3.50]; I2=6%). Again, we judged these 13 
results to be at high risk of bias, and three of them were 
not adjusted for age of the children.
effect modification
BCG vaccine
Nine studies (one clinical trial and eight cohort studies) 
compared BCG with no BCG separately for boys and 
girls. We found no apparent difference in effect between 
boys and girls (ratio of relative risks 1.02, 0.73 to 1.41; 
I2=0%; fig 6 (a)). The average age at which BCG vaccina-
tion was administered varied across studies, from soon 
after birth to 4.8 months. Two cohort studies reported 
effects for children vaccinated at different ages: the 
beneficial effect of BCG seemed to decrease as age at 
vaccination increased (fig 7 (a)). The two clinical trials 
comparing BCG at birth with delayed BCG (recom-
mended at six weeks) among low birthweight infants 
suggested a possible benefit of early over delayed 
BCG.24 25 We found insufficient evidence to determine 
whether the effect of BCG varies with vitamin A supple-
mentation status.
DTP vaccine
Twelve of the 16 cohort studies compared DTP with no 
DTP separately for boys and girls (fig 6 (b)). Only one 
study found evidence of a difference,20 with 95% confi-
dence intervals indicating that boys benefit more (or are

similarly strong evidence of a difference in either direc-
tion; eight of these found a tendency for receipt of DTP 
to be associated with a more harmful effect in girls than 
boys. The overall ratio of relative risks was 0.72 (0.46 to 
1.14; I2=28%). No studies reported results for different 
ages at DTP vaccination. We found insufficient evidence 
to determine whether any difference exists in effect of 
DTP according to vitamin A supplementation status.

Two clinical trials and 10 cohort studies compared MCV 
with no MCV separately for boys and girls (fig 6(c)). 
Effects in girls seemed to be more beneficial than those 
in boys (ratio of relative risks 1.54, 1.22 to 1.94; I2=0%). 
Where ages at vaccination were available, they were 
typically around 9 months, ranging from 4.5 months 
in a clinical trial to median 15.8 months in a cohort 
study. One case-control study reported larger effects in

children vaccinated before rather than after 12 months 
(fig 7(b)). On the basis of three studies, there was no 
consistent difference in the effect of MCV according to 
(previous or concurrent) administration of vitamin A.
discussion
BCG, DTP, and MCV have prevented countless illnesses 
and deaths among infants and children worldwide, 
especially those living in the world’s poorest countries. 
We systematically reviewed evidence on associations 
between receipt of these vaccines and childhood mor-
tality, with a focus on effects beyond those attributable 
to the targeted diseases. With few exceptions, the stud-
ies identified were observational in nature and thus 
prone to many well recognised forms of bias. Receipt 
of BCG and standard titre MCV was associated with a 
lower risk of all cause mortality, but receipt of DTP was 
associated with a higher risk of mortality in seven stud-
ies and a lower risk in two studies. In comparisons 
within studies, receipt of DTP was associated with a 
higher risk of mortality than receipt of BCG or MCV. The 
clinical trials of BCG included two in low birthweight 
infants, and together these indicated a reduction in 
mortality. The beneficial effect of receipt of MCV seemed 
to be greater among girls than boys. Evidence on modi-
fication of the effects of any of the three vaccines on the 
risk of all cause mortality by vitamin A supplementa-
tion status or age at vaccination was generally insuffi-
cient to allow conclusions to be drawn.
strengths and limitations of study
Our review provides a comprehensive evaluation of the 
evidence to date. We did an extensive search for studies 
and carefully addressed the overlap of children across 
multiple analysis reports. The assessment of potential 
bias is a difficult and subjective judgment, but we 
attempted to do this systematically with a detailed 
assessment tool; we quantified the evidence within 
strata defined by study design and potential for bias.
Although limited clinical trial evidence was available 
for BCG and MCV, it was broadly consistent with the 
larger body of evidence from observational studies. We 
excluded the randomised trials of high titre measles 
vaccine because it is not currently in use. The main limita-
tion of our review relates to the risk of bias in the results of 
the included studies. Our review was also based only on 
our evaluation of written reports of the studies, and we 
did not contact authors for missing information.
Many types of bias may have influenced the results 
of the observational studies included here. Uncon-

trolled or poorly controlled confounding was a poten-
tial problem in all of them, including confounding at 
baseline (for example, because frail children may be less 
likely to be vaccinated), post-vaccination confounding 
(for example, due to co-interventions), and adjustment 
for different selections of potential confounders. Base-
line confounding, if ignored, would tend to lead to bias 
towards a beneficial effect of the vaccine, because 
children with a worse prognosis generally tend to be 
vaccinated later or not vaccinated at all (sometimes 
described as “frailty bias”). We therefore prioritised 
effect estimates adjusted for baseline confounders.
Selection biases and information bias arising from 
misclassification of vaccination status were also causes 
of concern. Selection biases might be expected to 
 
operate in the opposite direction to baseline confound-
ing. For instance, if children are recruited some time 
after vaccination, then early deaths among unvacci-
nated children—deaths that might have been prevented 
had the children been vaccinated—are not observed. 
Furthermore, censoring follow-up of children on receipt 
of a subsequent vaccination, as was done in some stud-
ies of DTP vaccination, may selectively remove observa-
tion time from children who have received the vaccine 
of interest and are well enough to receive the next one, 
introducing bias towards an adverse effect of the vac-
cine. Misclassification of vaccinated children as unvac-
cinated would typically lead to bias towards the null 
(no effect), as occurs when a “landmark” approach is 
taken to the analysis.10 However, systematic misclassifi-
cation of dead children as unvaccinated would lead to a 
bias in favour of the vaccine, and this would not provide 
an explanation for the observed potentially harmful 
effect of DTP. Potential biases due to previous receipt, 
co-administration, and subsequent administration of 
other vaccines (for example, DTP or MCV when examin-
ing BCG) also exist. The direction of these biases 
depends on whether the other vaccines have beneficial 
or harmful effects, and we are not able to make assump-
tions about these effects in the context of this review. In 
summary, predicting the direction of bias for individual 
studies or the accumulated body of evidence is very dif-
ficult, as is estimation of its magnitude.
A further potential source of bias, which is particularly 
difficult to assess, is the selective reporting (and non- 
reporting) of results, both through mechanisms that lead 
articles to be written and published and through deci-
sions about which results to present. This is known to be 
a major problem in randomised trials,26 and it is, in gen-
eral, likely to be even more serious in observational stud-
ies. The similarity of meta-analysis estimates from fixed 
effect and random effects approaches provides some 
reassurance against an important relation between study 
size and magnitude of effect, but we do not consider this 
to be evidence against the presence of reporting biases.
Although most of the studies of DTP vaccine sug-
gested that receipt of this vaccine was associated with 
an increased risk of all cause mortality in the period 
shortly after vaccination, it is not clear that this can be 
attributed to DTP vaccine because the available studies 
were observational and judged to be at high risk of bias. 
Furthermore, unlike for BCG and MCV, no randomised 
trials were available for DTP. We are also unable to sep-
arate the effects of DTP from those of oral polio vaccine 
because they were almost always co-administered.
Six of the studies examined all three of the vaccines, 
and their findings are shown in figure 8. We would 
expect many of the same types of bias to be present 
across the three comparisons within each study. In four 
of the studies, there is an apparent beneficial effect of 
BCG and MCV and an apparent harmful effect of DTP on 
mortality. We are unable to explain these patterns using 
information relating to potential risks of bias available 
in the study reports, and regard the findings to be a 
cause for concern.
interpretation and implications of findings
The findings should be interpreted in the context of the 
absolute risks of mortality reported by the included 
studies. Among the cohort studies of BCG vaccine, the 
mortality risk ranged from 1% over 12 months to 9% 
over 24 months. Assuming a 2% mortality risk over six 
months, vaccine relative risks of 0.5 and 0.75 would 
imply that there were 10 and five fewer deaths, respec-
tively, per 1000 children during this period of time. Sim-
ilarly, among the cohort studies of DTP, the mortality 
risk ranged from 0.7% over six months to 6% over 24 
months. Assuming a 2% mortality risk over 12 months, 
vaccine relative risks of 1.2 and 1.4 would imply that 
there were four and eight extra deaths, respectively, per 
1000 children during the subsequent year,
Findings from the studies included in this review are 
not necessarily applicable to infants and children glob-
ally. Follow-up periods were often of necessity short, 
mostly to less than 12 months of age for BCG and to less 
than 9 months of age for DTP. Many of the studies took 
place in communities with many years of use of these 
vaccines. In these studies, a combination of direct vac-
cine effects and herd immunity gave rise to low inci-
dences of the diseases targeted by the vaccines, so that 
net benefits of routine use of these vaccines may not 
have been apparent. One large study, however, observed 
an increase in mortality on first introduction of the DTP 
vaccine.27  Several studies of MCV also provide results 
for mortality with censoring for deaths caused by, or as 
a consequence of, measles infection.28 29 30 31 32 33 They 
reported similar reductions in mortality for these 
“non-specific” effects to those that we have presented 
for overall mortality. This suggests that if the effects we 
observed are real then they are not fully explained by 
deaths that were established as due to measles.
It is more than 30 years since early observational 
studies in west Africa suggested that some routine 
infant immunisations might have effects on risk of mor-
tality and morbidity unrelated to the specific diseases 
they are intended to prevent.34 Our review shows that 
many studies examining these non-specific effects of 
various vaccines have now been conducted and pro-
vides support for the hypothesis. For example, tubercu-
losis is now an infrequent cause of death in infants and 
young children, so if BCG has an effect on all cause mor-
tality it is unlikely to be entirely due to fewer deaths

from that disease. On the basis of the few studies that 
attempted to remove measles deaths from the calcula-
tions, any effect of MCV on all cause mortality seems 
unlikely to be fully accounted for by measles deaths. 
Any increase in all cause mortality following DTP is also 
likely to be a non-specific effect
Our review was conducted at the request of WHO fol-
lowing a recommendation of the Strategic Advisory 
Group of Experts (SAGE) on the need to assess whether 
the evidence concerning non-specific effects is suffi-
cient to warrant adjusting the routine immunisation 
schedule or pursuing further research designed to sup-
port future evidence based adjustments in immunisa-
tion policies. We do not believe that the available 
evidence supports a change in either the choice of vac-
cines or the timing or sequence of immunisations rou-
tinely administered to infants and children. These 
views concur with the SAGE recommendations in April 
2014.6 At the same time, the data raise sufficient con-
cerns for us to strongly recommend further studies on 
the possible effects of immunisations on the immune 
system and on the risk of morbidity and mortality, 
particularly in relation to DTP. Randomised trials are 
needed to overcome the difficulties of interpretation of 
observational studies, and they should be sufficiently 
powered to examine possibly differential effects 
between boys and girls. Until the results of such trials 
are available, detrimental non-specific effects of DTP, 
if any, can probably be minimised by ensuring that 
infants receive their routine immunisations according 
to the currently recommended WHO schedule.
We are indebted to Ana Maria Henao-Restrepo and Ximena Riveros de 
Laurie (Department of Immunization Vaccines and Biologicals, WHO) 
for their support throughout the project and to all members of the 
SAGE Working Group on non-specific effects of vaccines for their input.
