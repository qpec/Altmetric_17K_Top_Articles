Objective. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), autoreac-
tive B cells are pathogenic drivers and sources of anti–
citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) that are a diag-
nostic biomarker and predictor of worse long-term progno-
sis. Yet, the immunobiologic significance of persistent
ACPA production at the cellular level is poorly understood.
This study was undertaken to investigate the representation
of ACPA-expressing switched-memory B cells in RA.
Methods. In a cross-sectional study of RA patients,
we investigated the presence of continued defects in
immune homeostasis as a function of disease activity.
Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
and a sensitive multiplex bead-based immunoassay, we
characterized fine binding antibody specificities in sera,
synovial fluid (SF), and B cell culture supernatants. In
this manner, we determined the frequency and epitope
reactivity patterns of ACPAs produced by SF B cells and
switched-memory blood B cells and compared the latter
to serum ACPA levels and disease activity scores.
Results. Cultured B cells from SF were shown to
spontaneously secrete ACPAs, while constitutive IgG
autoantibody production by peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMCs) was substantially less frequent. After
in vitro stimulation, PBMCs secreted IgG ACPA that was
overwhelmingly from switched-memory B cells, across all
patient groups treated with methotrexate and/or a tumor
necrosis factor inhibitor. Intriguingly, the frequencies of
ACPA-expressing switched-memory B cells significantly
correlated with serum IgG anti–cyclic citrullinated pep-
tide 3 (r 5 0.57, P5 0.003). Moreover, treatment-induced
clinical remission had little or no effect on the circulating
burden of switched-memory ACPA-expressing B cells, in
part explaining the continued dysregulation of humoral
immunity.
Conclusion. Our findings rationalize why thera-
peutic cessation most often results in disease reactivation
and clinical flare. Hence, a clinical disease activity score
is not a reliable indicator of the resolution of pathologic
recirculating B cell autoimmunity.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflamma-
tory disease affecting ;1–2% of Western populations that
can lead to joint destruction, disability, and early mortality
(1,2). Disease is postulated to be initiated by an inflamma-
tory response in periodontal tissue, pulmonary airways,
and/or the intestine (3–6). Progression to tissue injury is
linked to a specific breach in immunologic tolerance to
autoantigens generated by a posttranslational enzymatic
process, citrullination, that modifies the side chains of
arginine residues. In fact, circulating anti–citrullinated
protein antibodies (ACPAs), which recognize a progres-
sively expanding number of citrullinated protein epi-
topes,
may
arise

 involvement (7,8). ACPAs themselves and ACPA-
containing immune complexes have been postulated to be
directly pathogenic (9). Moreover, B lymphocytes, which
infiltrate the inflamed synovial membranes of affected
joints and locally produce ACPAs and rheumatoid factor
(RF), also contribute to pathogenesis through antigen pre-
sentation, costimulation of CD41 T cells, and secretion of
chemokines and cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6),
tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and RANKL (10–13).
The presence of serum ACPAs, as detected by a
cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) assay, both serves as a
diagnostic biomarker and predicts a worse prognosis for
progressive joint damage (14). At clinical onset, RA
patients also have expansions of memory B cell subset(s)
that correlate with worse long-term clinical outcomes (15).
Importantly, even though treat-to-target strategies can
more dependably induce low disease activity and clinical
remission, serum ACPAs nonetheless generally persist.
The immunobiologic basis for this persistence remains
obscure, since ACPA production in ectopic synovial lym-
phoid tissue is presumably diminished with disease remis-
sion. It can be postulated that ACPAs continue to be
spontaneously produced by long-lived plasma cells in the
bone marrow or other sites, which have become discon-
nected from a previous pathogenic synovial process. We
decided to test this model by determining whether
disease-associated autoreactive peripheral B cells dis-
appeared or persisted in patients in treatment-induced
clinical remission.
Herein, we have compared the binding specificities
of serum antibodies and peripheral blood B cells, with spe-
cial focus on the representation of ACPA-expressing
switched-memory B cells, which require additional stimuli
to secrete antibodies. We have also characterized the fine
binding specificities of these memory B cells, and enumer-
ated their frequencies in the peripheral blood. Impor-
tantly, to better understand the effect of treatment on the
underlying autoimmune process, we assessed relationships
with clinical disease activity (16). Our findings show that
recirculating ACPA-expressing memory B cells generally
persist
despite
treatment
with
conventional
disease-
modifying antirheumatic drugs or TNF inhibition. Thus,
the dysregulation of systemic autoimmunity in RA persists,
even with remission of clinically relevant disease, which
likely accounts for the failure of most treatment regimens
to induce drug-free remission.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design, human subjects, and sample procure-
ment.
All patients fulfilled the 2010 American College of
Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism criteria
for RA (17) (see Supplementary Table 1, available on the
Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.
com/doi/10.1002/art.40053/abstract). For initial classification,
patients were defined as “seropositive” or “seronegative” based
on the CCP2 clinical test (Axis-Shield) (18). Patients were rec-
ruited at New York University and as part of the Rheumatoid
Arthritis Comparative Effectiveness Research (RACER) trial
at the University of Pittsburgh. All patients and healthy donors
provided written informed consent in accordance with protocols
approved by the Human Subjects Institutional Review Board of
the New York University School of Medicine and the University
of Pittsburgh.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and
multiplex bead-based assays.
In a central laboratory, serum
samples from all donors were tested for IgM-RF and IgG CCP3
(Inova Diagnostics) (19) (Supplementary Table 1). Samples with
high activity were further evaluated at multiple dilutions for accu-
rate activity assignment. Reactivity patterns for autocyclizing bio-
tinylated peptides (20–28) (see Supplementary Table 2, available
on the Arthritis & Rheumatology http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/art.40053/abstract,
for
citrullinated
and
native
peptides) were then defined (see Supplementary Figure 1, avail-
able on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40053/abstract). Using a
panel of avidin-coated microspheres and the same peptides/pro-
teins, we also refined a multiplex bead-based array (Luminex),
which has enhancements compared to methods described in a
recent report (29). Signal strength was quantified according to
the median fluorescence intensity from .35 beads for each ana-
lyte per well. During assay development, an additive (SurModics)
was included to limit the potential influence of RF in a sample.
A recombinant human IgG1 antibody to citrullinated fibrinogen
(clone 1F11; ModiQuest) was used as a positive control.
Synovial fluid mononuclear cell (SFMC) culture.
Briefly, after joint aspiration, an aliquot of SF was cleared by
centrifugation and then treated with hyaluronidase (20 units/
ml). Cells were recovered by Ficoll separation, washed, assessed
for viability, and cultured in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS), 10 mM HEPES, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol,
penicillin/streptomycin/glutamine with or without CpG 2006,
IL-21, and the CD40L-expressing feeder line, MS40L (30).
Detection of antigen-specific or IgG-secreting cells
(ISCs).
To determine the frequencies of total IgG and
antigen-specific IgG-secreting B cells, we adapted methodology
for enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISpot) detection (31,32).
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), cultured with or
without stimulants, were added at 2 3 105/well to 96-well
PVDF membrane plates (Millipore) coated with anti-human
IgG Fc-specific F(ab0)2 (Jackson ImmunoResearch) to capture
ISC products. To detect specificity, we added biotinylated CCP3,
biotinylated cyclic glutamine–containing peptide 3 (CQP3), bio-
tinylated tetanus toxoid (TT), or anti-human IgG antibody. To
develop, we used streptavidin-HRP80 (RDI; Fitzgerald) and
aminoethylcarbazole substrate. The enumeration of antigen-
specific ISCs was normalized per 106 PBMCs.
PBMC cultures. To assess the capacity for in vitro anti-
body secretion, PBMCs were isolated and cryopreserved, and
later cultured at 106 cells per well for 6 days in 1 ml of RPMI com-
plete media with 10% FBS, with or without CpG 2006 (6 mg/ml),
IL-21 (50 ng/ml), and soluble CD40L (500 ng/ml), adapting previ-
ously reported conditions (31). We used fluorescence-activated
cell sorting to isolate four B cell subpopulations: CD271IgD–,

 CD271IgD1, CD27–IgD–, and CD27–IgD1 (see Supplemen-
tary Figure 2, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at
http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40053/abstract).
Statistical analysis. We assessed nonparametric paired-
sample comparisons by Spearman’s correlation using Prism
software version 6.0e (GraphPad). P values less than 0.05 were
considered significant.
RESULTS
Patient cohorts and the development of citrulline-
specific immunoassays. Given our goal of investigating
the contributions of circulating ACPA-specific B lympho-
cytes to RA pathogenesis, we first assembled cohorts of
well-characterized patients. A cross-sectional cohort was
established at New York University that included patients
with new-onset RA and patients with established RA
(Supplementary Table 1). Assays for IgG CCP3 demon-
strated nearly complete concordance with the IgG CCP2
results obtained at enrollment (data not shown).
Development of a bead-based multiplex ACPA
assay.
To evaluate patterns of antibody reactivity with
citrulline-containing proteins and autocyclizing synthetic
peptides, we first independently evaluated reactivity by
ELISA (Supplementary Figure 1). These same peptides
and proteins were then adapted to a multiplex bead-based
array using a panel of avidin-coated microspheres, and we
found significant correlations between results obtained
with ELISA and our custom bead-based multiplex assays
(see Supplementary Figure 3, available on the Arthritis &
Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/art.40053/abstract).
To better assess the limits of detection, we evalu-
ated the binding reactivity pattern of a recombinant
human antibody to citrullinated fibrinogen, 1F11. This
IgG1 antibody demonstrated a dose-dependent hierar-
chy of reactivity with a range of citrulline-containing
antigenic ligands; with the most active antigenic ligands,
reactivity was detectable at 0.1 ng/ml (data not shown).
With this multiplex assay, we characterized the
circulating autoantibody fine specificity of sera from
seropositive and seronegative RA patients (Figure 1a).
The strongest IgG binding reactivity was generally with
the CCP3 peptide, while only infrequent and, at best,
weak reactivity was observed for the CQP3 peptide
(which contains the neutral side chain of glutamine resi-
dues instead of charged arginine residues). Otherwise,
RA patient sera displayed great heterogeneity in the
fine specificities of the ACPAs when tested with a range
of citrulline-containing antigens (Figures 1a and b).
We also evaluated ACPA responses in the sera of
RA
patients
who
had
received
different
treatment
regimens (i.e., patient groups receiving oral MTX and/or a
TNF inhibitor [TNFi]). We observed no major differences
between these groups with respect to ACPA fine binding

linated, but not native, cyclized peptide epitopes in a multiplex bead-based array. a, Serum samples from seropositive RA patients (n 5 24) and
seronegative RA patients (n 5 6) were diluted 1:1,000 and assessed for IgG anti–citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA) reactivity by multiplex
bead-based array. b, A custom multiplex bead-based antigen array was used to assess ACPAs in serum from RA patients receiving different
treatments. Samples from seropositive RA patients treated with methotrexate (MTX; n 5 20), seropositive RA patients treated with MTX and
tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi; n 5 20), and seronegative RA patients treated with MTX (n 5 10) were analyzed for IgG ACPA fine
specificities. Similar epitope specificity patterns were detected in the different treatment groups. Data are presented as the median fluorescence

 specificity, qualitatively or quantitatively, although we
again found that seropositive RA patients were highly het-
erogeneous with respect to their IgG ACPA epitope speci-
ficity profiles (Figure 1b). Samples from seronegative RA
patients, as defined by CCP2 and CCP3 assays, were gen-
erally nonreactive with other citrulline-containing anti-
gens, since our multiplex assay detected infrequent (0–
4%) recognition, as assessed by IgG binding of Cit-
peptides/proteins, and then with only weak reactivity (Fig-
ure 1), which is consistent with prior findings (33,34).
To further evaluate the clinical specificity of our
assay, we tested sera from healthy subjects and patients
with other rheumatic diseases, including osteoarthritis,
systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and
Sj€
ogren’s syndrome (see Supplementary Table 3, avail-
able on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://
onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40053/abstract).
Our findings confirmed that the detection of IgG anti-
citrulline antigen reactivity with our assay was highly
specific for patients with RA, since among these 87
disease-specific controls, we found that IgG reactivity
with the CCP3 peptide or other citrullinated antigens
was distinctly uncommon.
Specificity and frequency of disease-associated
autoreactive B cells at the site of disease. To evaluate
ACPAs produced at the site of disease, we assessed the
capacity of our multiplex assay to detect ACPAs in SF
samples from 2 seropositive RA patients. Substantial levels
of CCP31 IgG were present, while no reactivity with the
CQP3 control ligand was seen (Figure 2). Despite similar
levels of CCP3 reactivity in these 2 SF samples, there were
notable differences in the detection of IgG ACPA fine
binding specificities with the other citrulline-containing
peptides in the assay.
Figure 2. ACPA-reactive B cells are common in RA synovial fluid (SF), and SF mononuclear cell (SFMC) culture supernatant epitope reactivity
patterns mirror those in autologous SF. SF was obtained from 2 RA patients, and SFMCs were isolated. SFMCs (1,000 or 10,000 per well) were
cultured for 12 days with or without 3,000 MS40L cells/well and CpG 2006 and interleukin-21 (stim). Culture supernatants were analyzed using
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect IgG anti-CCP3, followed by a multiplex assay for epitope specificity of all positive
and some negative wells. SF was tested at 1:100 and 1:1,000 dilutions by ELISA and multiplex assay. “Fresh” indicates directly ex vivo–cultured
cells, and “cryo” indicates previously cryopreserved, thawed cells. RU 5 relative units (see Figure 1 for other definitions).
ACPA-EXPRESSING MEMORY B CELLS IN RA IN CLINICAL REMISSION
1179
 These SF mononuclear cell (SFMC) samples con-
tained a substantial representation of lymphocytes with
the surface phenotype of switched-memory B cells (data
not shown). SFMCs were cultured in media supplemented
with IL-21/CpG 2006, in the presence of the MS40L
feeder cell line that enables in vitro clonal expansion of
preactivated B cells (30), which also induced 20-fold
higher total IgG levels compared to unstimulated cultures
(data not shown). IgG ACPAs were commonly detected
in wells with 10,000 SFMCs, but were infrequent at 1,000
SFMCs/well, and never detected at 100 SFMCs/well. In
each well, IgG ACPA fine specificity was heterogeneous,
with the most common secreted ACPA epitope reactivities
reiterating the same immunodominant ACPA specificities
found in SF (Figure 2). While these studies document the
high frequency of ACPA-expressing B cells at the site of
disease, blood samples from these particular donors were,
unfortunately, not available for comparison.
Detection of circulating antigen-specific peripheral
B cells by ELISpot assay. To investigate the representa-
tion of circulating autoreactive B cells, we adapted ELISpot
methods
to
evaluate
the
representation
of
ACPA-
expressing B cells capable of constitutive ex vivo secretion
(i.e., plasma cells/blasts) and B cells that required in vitro
stimulation for IgG ACPA production (i.e., memory B
cells) (31,32). Without in vitro stimulation, we detected only
a very low frequency of spontaneous total ISCs (range 200–
321/106 PBMCs), and by this method, we detected neither
ACPA reactivity nor other TT-specific antibodies (data not
shown). In stimulated PBMCs from seropositive RA
patients, we found CCP3-reactive IgG spots in a mean6
SEM of 41.360.5 ISCs/106 PBMCs (range 0–205), repre-
senting 0.13% of all ISCs (Figure 3a). Only background
levels were detected with the control peptide CQP3
(mean6SEM 1.960.6 ISCs/106 PBMCs). In contrast, for
seronegative RA patients and healthy adults, CCP3 and
CQP3 ISCs were below the limit of detection. These results
confirmed that only RA patients have disease-specific circu-
lating B cells capable of secreting IgG ACPAs.
As an internal control, we found that almost all
RA patients and healthy subjects had detectable circulat-
ing IgG-expressing memory B cells reactive with the con-
trol bacterial antigen TT from the preventative vaccine
that has been given to almost every adult. RA patients
had a mean 6 SEM of 71.1 6 2.6 IgG anti-TT ISCs
(range 0–205) and healthy adults had 65.4 6 1.2 anti-TT
ISCs/106 PBMCs (range 0–220) (Figure 3a), with no sig-
nificant difference between the 2 groups. Notably, these
experiments showed that the frequencies of recirculating
anti-TT memory B cells overlap with the frequencies of
ACPA-specific B cells in seropositive RA patients. Al-
though these ELISpot assays were informative, we sought
to develop a more efficient means of illuminating the
broader range of fine binding autospecificities expressed
by peripheral B cells in a donor.
Figure 3. ACPA-expressing B cells are present in the circulation of
seropositive RA patients, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell
(PBMC) cultures from seropositive RA patients secrete IgG ACPAs

serum. a, Day 6 PBMC cultures (with or without CpG 2006,
interleukin-21, and CD40L) from seropositive RA patients (n5 19), a
seronegative (SN) RA patient, and healthy controls (HC; n 5 5) were
assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay for antigen-specific B cells

(n5 11), seronegative RA patients (n5 5), and seropositive RA patients

adapting previously described conditions (31). Culture supernatants
were assayed for antibody content by multiplex antigen bead assay using
anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) R-phycoerythrin (eBioscience). Data are
presented as the MFI. See Figure 1 for other definitions.

 ACPA production by PBMCs from RA patients.
To investigate the fine binding specificity of circulating
citrulline antigen–reactive B cells, the PBMC culture con-
ditions described above were used to induce B cell differ-
entiation and antibody production, which we evaluated
by multiplex bead array. Indeed, without stimulation, we
detected only low levels of IgG (mean 0.16 mg/ml [range
0.01–0.56 mg/ml]), while with 6 days of stimulation, IgG
levels were greatly increased (mean 7.65 mg/ml [range
1.85–20.95 mg/ml]). Based on IgG CCP3 reactivity,
ACPAs were found in 15 of 33 supernatants (45.5%)
from stimulated seropositive RA PBMCs (Figure 3b). In
general, wells that contained IgG anti-CCP3 antibodies
also displayed a range of reactivities for other citrulline-
containing epitopes (but not arginine-containing analogs)
that greatly varied between different RA donors. Taken
together with the ELISpot results described above, these
findings confirmed that seropositive RA patients com-
monly have circulating citrulline epitope–specific B cells.
Overall, IgG ACPAs were only detected in cul-
tures of PBMCs from seropositive RA patients, and in
most cases, only after 4–6 days of in vitro stimulation.
ACPAs
were
infrequently
detected
in
wells
with
unstimulated cells (i.e., 7 of 29 [24.1%] of seropositive
RA patients) (Figure 3b). Furthermore, the autoreac-
tive blood B cell clones in different donors appeared to
vary broadly by fine specificity for citrulline-containing
self-antigen variants. These findings support the notion
that RA patients have quiescent switched-memory B
cells that can express ACPAs in their blood, while circu-
lating constitutively IgG-secreting cells (i.e., plasma
cells/plasmablasts) are much less commonly detected.
The relationship between the fine specificity of
serum ACPAs and of the stimulated circulating ACPA-
expressing memory B cells within the PBMCs was evalu-
ated.
Intriguingly,
we
found
significant
correlations
between the serum IgG reactivities and in vitro secreted
autoantibodies to CCP3 (P, 0.0001), Cit-filaggrin cfc6
(P5 0.0001), and 7 other citrullinated antigens that were
tested (see Supplementary Figure 4, available on the
Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.
wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40053/abstract). Correlations for
serum and in vitro–produced anti-TT antibody responses
were also observed (P5 0.03). These results strongly sup-
port the notion that there is a connection between
epitope-specific ACPAs in serum and the fine specificities
of circulating autoreactive B cells. However, clinical dis-
ease activity, based on the Disease Activity Score in 28
joints (DAS28) (35), correlated with neither the level nor
the ACPA specificity in serum or supernatant (data not
shown).
Evaluation of sorted peripheral blood B cells
by multiplex assay. To directly determine which B cell
subsets in the peripheral blood are the source of RA
disease-associated ACPAs, we used flow cytometry to
isolate CD3–CD14–CD191 B cells from PBMCs into 4
subpopulations: CD271IgD– cells, CD271IgD1 cells,
CD27–IgD– cells, and CD27–IgD1 cells. The MS40L

Following
culture
of
switched-memory B cells with stimulants for 12 days, we
detected 10-fold greater levels of total IgG (mean6 SD
3.26 2.4 mg/ml) than was associated with any other defined
B cell subset.
Cultured switched-memory B cells (CD271IgD–)
most consistently produced high levels of IgG ACPAs.
Otherwise, ACPAs were only infrequently detected in
wells from “double-negative” B cells (CD27–IgD–).
Other sorted subsets had no detectable ACPA activity
(data not shown), since IgG ACPAs were never detected
among preswitched-memory B cells (CD271IgD1) or
naive/transitional B cells (CD27–IgD1).
Overall, these data document that IgG ACPAs
primarily derive from switched-memory B cells (i.e.,
ACPA-expressing memory B cells) in the circulation of
RA patients (Table 1). Moreover, ACPA-expressing
memory B cells were detected in the circulation of sero-
positive RA patients in both treatment groups tested
(MTX or TNFi), with detection most frequently based
on reactivity with the CCP3 ligand, while there was much
greater heterogeneity with other individual citrulline-
containing peptides, but neither had detectable reactivity
with B cells from seronegative RA patients or unaffected
control subjects. We also surveyed for IgM autoantibodies,
but every case of IgM reactivity with citrulline-containing
ligands was associated with high polyreactivity with other
antigens as well (data not shown), and therefore, no truly
monospecific IgM ACPAs were detected.
Correlation of the burden of circulating ACPA-
expressing B cells with serum levels of ACPAs. Based
on evidence that seropositive RA patients commonly have
circulating B cells that are capable of secreting IgG
Figure 4. A high burden of ACPA-expressing switched-memory B cells (mBc) correlates with a high serum ACPA level, and epitope specificities
largely recapitulate those in circulating serum ACPAs in the same subject. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seropositive RA
patients were stained, and switched-memory (CD191IgD–CD271) B cells were separated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting and cultured for 12
days at 50 cells/well with MS40L cells plus CpG 2006 and interleukin-21. Wells that were determined to be positive for CCP3 by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay prescreening were subjected to multiplex analysis for citrullinated epitope reactivity. Multiplex wells were counted as positive
if reactivity of a citrullinated peptide (based on MFI) was .50 MFI and $2-fold that of the native peptide. a, For samples from patients with sero-
positive RA who were receiving a TNFi (n5 12) or MTX (n5 12), ACPA-positive wells were counted, since these were assumed to contain 1 or
more ACPA-expressing memory B cells per well. Data were converted to switched-memory B cells per 10,000 memory B cells cultured, and then
plotted against serum IgG anti-CCP3 (with relative units [RU]/ml determined by IgG CCP3 clinical test and with additional serum dilutions per-
formed when required). b, Representative multiplex data for samples from 5 seropositive RA patients, depicting serum (diluted 1:1,000) and super-

 ACPAs, we wondered whether there was a relationship
between the levels of these autoantibody-expressing mem-
ory B cells and their serum IgG ACPA levels. We there-
fore performed surveys on samples from a cross-sectional
study of RA patients.
Overall, we found ACPA secretion in a mean of
1.4% of wells containing 50 viable switched-memory B cells
(CD191CD271IgD–) (range 0–7.7%), while IgG ACPA-
expressing B cells were never detected in healthy donors
(Table 1). Considering the number of B cells that were
tested, we estimated that ACPA reactivity was expressed by
a mean6 SD of 0.036 0.04% of switched-memory B cells
in a seropositive RA patient (range 0–0.15%). Notably, we
found a significant direct correlation between the propor-
tion of wells with detectable IgG ACPAs and serum levels
of
IgG
anti-CCP3
(Spearman’s
correlation
r 5 0.57,
P 5 0.003) (Figure 4a). In general, ACPA-expressing B
cells in individual wells exhibited great heterogeneity in
their recognition of multiple autoantigenic determinants
(Figure 4b). Taken together, the data indicate that there is
a biologic link between the frequencies of recirculating anti-
citrulline memory B cells and serum ACPA levels.
Lack of correlation of levels of circulating
ACPA-expressing B cells with disease activity.
Over
the past 2 decades, there have been remarkable advances
in the efficacy of treatment regimens, and in our capacity
to accurately gauge overall disease activity in individual
RA patients. Neither total blood levels of memory B cells
nor IgG CCP3 antibody levels correlated with disease
activity (data not shown). We therefore next sought to
determine whether we could find relationships between
RA clinical disease activity and levels of recirculating cit-
rulline antigen–reactive memory B cells. Our cross-
sectional studies were performed on patients who dis-
played a wide range of serum IgG anti-CCP3 levels, and
based on the DAS28 (36), disease activity ranged from
high (DAS28 .5.1) in some patients to clinical remission
(DAS28 ,2.6) in others. ACPA switched-memory B cells
were found in the majority of seropositive RA patients (16
of 24 [66.7%]) (Figures 4 and 5). Yet, from quantitation
of the frequency of wells with detectable ACPAs, we found
only a nonsignificant trend toward a higher frequency of
ACPA-expressing blood memory B cells in patients with
higher DAS28 scores (Figure 5). Further analyses in subsets
of patients who received treatment with either methotrexate
(MTX) or a biologic agent (TNFi) also failed to show a signif-
icant correlation. Most importantly, ACPA-expressing mem-
ory B cells were detected in most seropositive RA patients in
clinical remission (8 of 14), based on DAS28 scores of ,2.6
(Figure 5).
In summary, treatment with standard of care
regimens, while sufficient to reduce disease activity and, in
some patients, to attain clinical remission, was not suffi-
cient to eliminate ACPA-expressing memory B cells from
the peripheral circulation, regardless of the DAS28 score
(Figure 5). A subset of RA patients had very high frequen-
cies of circulating ACPA-expressing memory B cells, with
a variety of ACPA epitope reactivity patterns in individual
patients (Figure 4b). Serum IgG CCP3 was also detected
in the patient subsets with high, moderate, and low disease
activity, as well as those in remission according to the
DAS28, although this association was not significant (data
not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that the
presence of a high burden of circulating ACPA-expressing
memory B cells may persist despite seemingly effective
therapeutic interventions and is not reflected by standard
measures of disease activity.
DISCUSSION
We found that seropositive RA patients, but not
seronegative RA patients or healthy adults, have substan-
tial levels of circulating anticitrullinated epitope-specific B
Figure 5. High burdens of circulating anti–citrullinated protein anti-
body (ACPA) switched-memory B cells (mBc) can be detected in the
circulation of treated rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, including
those whose disease is in clinical remission. For samples from patients
with seropositive RA who were receiving tumor necrosis factor inhibi-
tor (TNFi) therapy (n5 12) or methotrexate (MTX; n5 12), ACPA-
positive switched-memory B cells (per 10,000 switched-memory B cells
cultured) were quantified as described in Figure 4, plotted against the
Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS28), and analyzed by
Spearman’s correlation. The DAS28 using the C-reactive protein level
(DAS28-CRP) was used in 21 patients, and the DAS28 using the
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) was used in 3 patients
for whom CRP data were not available. Levels of ACPA-expressing
switched-memory B cells did not correlate significantly with DAS28
scores. Results of correlation analyses with DAS28-CRP and DAS28-
ESR were equivalent. NS5 not significant.
ACPA-EXPRESSING MEMORY B CELLS IN RA IN CLINICAL REMISSION

 cells, at frequencies akin to those for an antigen-specific
protective B cell response. Circulating RA-associated
ACPA-expressing B cells were predominantly switched-
memory (i.e., CD271IgD–) B cells (37–39) that do not
spontaneously secrete ACPAs without in vitro activation.
These B cells displayed a range of binding autospecificities
for different citrullinated epitopes and were also cross-
reactive with the synthetic CCP3 peptide widely used to
confirm the clinical diagnosis of RA, while they did not
recognize native arginine-containing self–protein/peptide
analogs.
Our surveys of a cross-sectional cohort of adult RA
patients also revealed that the frequency of activatable cit-
rullinated antigen–reactive B cells in a subject was directly
proportional to serum IgG ACPA levels. While the range
of IgG ACPA specificities expressed varied greatly between
individual patients, for an individual RA patient the serum
ACPA binding reactivity pattern was very similar to that
induced by in vitro stimulation of disease-associated mem-
ory B cells. Whereas it has been argued that serum auto-
antibodies may be primarily produced by antibody-
secreting B lineage cells that infiltrate affected synovial
linings (20,40) and/or the bone marrow (41), our findings
suggest that the same clonal sets may be represented
among the memory B cells in the bloodstream.
Progressive advances in our understanding of RA
pathogenesis have led to the introduction of therapeutic
agents that often provide high-hurdle clinical benefits, and
biopsy/rebiopsy studies have shown this is generally par-
alleled by resolution of the pathogenic lymphocytic and
myeloid synovial infiltrates in affected joints (42–44). Yet
despite these therapeutic advancements, such treatments
are generally associated with only modest decreases in cir-
culating IgM-RF or IgG ACPA/CCP, and very rarely do
these serologic disease markers become undetectable.
In this study, we demonstrated that therapeutic
interventions (MTX and/or TNFi) did not dependably
abolish the recirculating autoantigen-targeted memory
B cells that reflect the disease-associated defect in B cell
immunologic tolerance, even in patients who attained
clinical remission. Our findings therefore confirm that,
despite the capacity of TNF inhibition to apparently dis-
engage autoreactive B cells from the inflammatory
destructive effector pathways in the rheumatoid synovial
apparently disease process, these treatments do not
appear to substantially impact the underlying patho-
genic autoimmunity (as recently discussed [15]).
Our integrated technical approach provided
insights that complement other cutting-edge methods for
the isolation and characterization of individual B cells in
the RA autoimmune response. Recombinant monoclonal
antibodies have been recovered and expressed from
single synovium-infiltrating B cells, and RA B cell recep-
tor repertoire studies have also provided the molecular
characterization of ACPA binding specificity, B cell
clonal relatedness, and immunogenetic origins (39,45).
Tetramer technology for flow cytometric sorting has also
been adapted for the study of autoantigen-specific B cells
from RA patients (39). While these approaches provide
important perspectives, single B cell analyses enable
detailed examinations of individual antigen-reactive lym-
phocytes (akin to the in-depth study of “individual
trees”), while the latter approaches provide broad surveys
of disease-associated B cell lineage “forests.”
Our
approach provided an informative middle ground since it
was designed to quantitate memory B cells and also eluci-
date autoantibody fine specificity and cross-reactivity in
groups of patients. Our approach may require larger
blood samples to derive more-accurate frequencies when
in vivo levels of ACPA-expressing B cells among periph-
eral B cells are low. In the future, we would like to apply
our now validated methods to longitudinal studies of
individuals before and after starting a new agent.
Our investigations have provided direct evidence
that memory B cells are not eradicated in peripheral
blood following therapeutic attainment of clinical remis-
sion. Therefore, the regimens that we examined are
insufficient for induction of long-term immune remission.
In fact, patients with high serum IgG anti-CCP3 levels
were significantly more likely to have high frequencies of
ACPA-expressing switched-memory B cells, suggesting
there are likely ongoing roles for these cells in the pro-
duction of serum ACPAs. Our findings also suggest that
serum ACPA levels are closely intertwined with the per-
sistence of circulating ACPA-expressing memory B cells.
We therefore wonder about the relationship between
memory B cells and long-lived plasma cells, as our
findings are consistent with a model in which memory B
cells are required to replenish ACPA-secreting plasma
cells in the bone marrow and potentially at other sites.
The contributions of B cells to RA pathogenesis
have been best documented by the clinical efficacy of
rituximab, the prototypical anti-CD20 antibody, which
induces efficient eradication of B cells from the blood.
However, the impact at other sites may not be accurately
reflected in the bloodstream levels. In treated RA patients
with clinical benefits, when in vivo therapeutic anti-CD20
levels later wane, the return of detectable levels of blood B
cells is often associated with an overall reduction in the
levels of different CD271 B cell subsets that can persist
for years (46). Yet, to the best of our knowledge, the pro-
portions of these posttreatment recovery memory B cells
linked to host immune defenses versus disease-associated
autoimmunity have not been investigated.

PELZEK ET AL
 In conclusion, our results highlight the fact that
commonly used treatment regimens are deficient in affect-
ing the underlying pathologic autoimmune disease pro-
cess. These findings therefore help to rationalize the
outcome of 2 large trials in which cessation of therapy in
RA patients in clinical remission led to relapse in the great
majority of RA patients within the first year (47–49).
Indeed, these regimens fail to provide an effective cure for
RA because they do not have the capacity to target the
reservoirs of pathogenic autoreactive B cells (as well as T
cells).
We therefore propose that the next phase in the
development of RA therapy should have a goal of delet-
ing pathologic memory cells and reversing the defect in
immune tolerance. Progress
toward
this
goal
will
require the adoption of a new standard for differentiat-
ing clinical remission from true immune remission,
which includes an assessment of cellular autoimmune
players that will otherwise be responsible for disease
reactivation and clinical relapse. Our technical approach
for assessing the autoimmune B cell burden in RA
patients may therefore provide this essential tool for
assessing the capacity of treatment regimens to target
and eliminate disease-specific autoimmunity, as well as
for making better and more informed treatment deci-
sions in daily clinical practice.
