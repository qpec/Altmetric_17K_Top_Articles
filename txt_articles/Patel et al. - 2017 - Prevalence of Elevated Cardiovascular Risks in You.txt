 Measurements—Ten-year ASCVD risk was estimated using the 2013 ACC/AHA ASCVD risk 
calculator. Participants were subdivided by age, gender and history of smoking and hypertension. 
The percentage of adults with 10-year ASCVD risk > 5% and adults with LDL ≥190mg/dL in 
each subgroup were estimated. Low prevalence subgroups were defined as those in which we 
could rule out a prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk of more than 1% (upper 95% 
confidence bound for the prevalence was ≤1%).
Results—Overall, 9,608 NHANES participants representing 67.9 million adults were included, 
with approximately half (47.12%, representing 32 million adults) in low prevalence subgroups. In 
the absence of smoking or hypertension, 0.09% (95% CI: 0.02%, 0.35%) of adult men aged <40 
years and 0.04% (95% CI: 0.0%, 0.26%) of women under 50 years had an elevated risk. Among 
other subgroups, 0% – 75.9% of participants had an elevated risk. Overall, 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3%, 
3.5%) had LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL.
Limitations—No information available regarding cardiovascular outcomes.
Conclusions—In the absence of risk factors, the prevalence of increased ASCVD risk is low 
among women below the age of 50 years and men below 40 years.

Introduction
Elevated cholesterol levels have been long known to be a strong risk factor for 
cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction and stroke.(1–3) Screening for dyslipidemia 
can identify asymptomatic individuals at risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular 
disease (ASCVD), allowing them to pursue lifestyle interventions or medical therapy. The 
2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol 
management guidelines recommend checking a first lipid panel for all adults above 20 years 
of age and repeating it every 4–6 years to identify individuals at a high-risk for 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.(4) For primary prevention, the high risk population 
has been defined as adults with a 10-year risk of ASCVD above 7.5% or a lifetime risk 
above 30%, as well as those with very high LDL cholesterol levels or primary genetic 
hyperlipidemias, for whom models may not accurately reflect risk.(5) In contrast, the US 
Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 2008 guideline recommends starting screening at 
35 years for men or 45 years for women unless they have one or more traditional risk factors 
for atherosclerosis.(6) One reason for this discrepancy is the lack of clinical trial evidence to 
support cholesterol screening for primary prevention in the young adult population.(7)
Because total and HDL cholesterol levels are required to calculate ASCVD risk, the decision 
to institute primary prevention requires a screening cholesterol level. However, based on the 
underlying distribution of cholesterol in the population, it may be possible to identify 
patients who, based on their lack of other risk factors, are very unlikely to have an ASCVD 
risk high enough to warrant treatment and therefore are unlikely to benefit from cholesterol 
screening. To help decide between the approach of the AHA/ACC and that of the USPSTF, 
we aimed to describe the prevalence of elevated ASCVD risk in young adults by 
extrapolating the Pooled Cohort risk prediction equation to a nationally representative 
sample of adults 30–49 years of age. We identify the prevalence of elevated 10-year ASCVD

 risk in different subgroups based on age, sex, smoking and the presence of hypertension. We 
also describe the prevalence of very high LDL cholesterol levels identified by routine lipid 
screening in this population.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This study involved a cross-sectional analysis of adults aged 30 to 49 years who participated 
in the examination component of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 
(NHANES).(8) NHANES is conducted by the Centers of Disease Control (CDC)/National 
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) and utilizes a complex, multi-stage, clustered 
probability sampling method of non-institutionalized US civilians to provide nationally 
representative estimates. NHANES data from 1999–2000 through 2011–2012 were 
analyzed; 2013–2014 sample was excluded because prescription drug data are not yet 
available. Participants with missing data and those with self-reported stroke, coronary artery 
disease, other cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, or 
angina) and diabetes were excluded. In our primary analysis we also excluded participants 
who were already taking a statin or any other lipid-lowering drug at the time of the visit 
when lipid profiles were drawn, because their results would not represent their true lipid 
levels, but included them in a sensitivity analysis. All participants provided written informed 
consent. The study protocol was approved by NCHS Institutional Review Board.(8)
Covariates—We used the following self-reported information: age, gender, race, smoking 
status and treatment with anti-hypertensive medications. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), 
Total cholesterol (TC) and High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) measurements 
were available and included for all examined participants, but only the morning session 
participants had fasting Low Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) 
measurements. Although standardized laboratory protocol was employed to perform all lipid 
analyses, there were some changes in the laboratories, methods and instruments used to 
make these measurements across the study period.(9) The Friedewald equation was used to 
calculate LDL-C levels for participants with TG level ≤400 mg/dL. Hypertension was 
defined as blood pressure ≥140/90 mmHg [average of ≥3 readings] as measured at the 
NHANES examination, self-report that a doctor/health professional diagnosed hypertension 
on at least 2 different occasions, and/or current receipt of an anti-hypertensive medication. 
Family history of premature ASCVD (a first degree relative with heart attack before age 50 
years) was self-reported for participants in the NHANES surveys beginning in 2005–06.
Definition of Elevated Cardiovascular Risk and Low Prevalence Groups—The 
purpose of our study was to identify subgroups for which screening for cholesterol would 
not provide actionable information. Therefore, we defined elevated cardiovascular risk as a 
10-year ASCVD risk of greater than 5%—the lowest ASCVD risk at which statin therapy 
might be considered according to the guideline—using the 2013 ACC/AHA ASCVD pooled 
cohort equation.(5) Because the equation may overestimate risk in low-risk patients,(10–12) 
our choice represents a conservative threshold which might be more sensitive in younger age 
groups.(13) We then created subgroups of participants by age, gender and history of

 smoking and hypertension, and calculated the prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk 
within each subgroup. We found no studies to inform a threshold prevalence of risk that 
would justify screening. We defined low prevalence subgroups as those groups in which we 
could rule out a prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk of more than 1% (i.e. upper 
bound of the 95% confidence limit was ≤ 1%). This seemed a reasonably conservative 
estimate, since the number-needed-to-treat with statins to prevent one fatal or non-fatal CHD 
event in primary prevention is approximately 56.(14) At a prevalence of <1%, the number-
needed-to-screen to prevent one cardiovascular event would be at least 100 times as great 
(i.e. more than 5,600).
Definition of elevated LDL-cholesterol level—To identify participants with LDL 
cholesterol high enough to directly qualify for statin treatment, we estimated the proportion 
of adults with LDL cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg/dL, which is the recommended 
screening threshold for identifying patients with familial hyperlipidemia.(15) To evaluate the 
utility of targeted screening of young adults for familial hyperlipidemia in patients with self-
reported family history of premature ASCVD, we assessed whether the proportion of 
participants with LDL cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg/dL differ by presence of a 
positive family history of premature ASCVD. (15)
Statistical analysis—We generated nationally representative prevalence estimates after 
incorporating appropriate 2-year or 4-year sample weights (for the main analysis) or 
morning fasting subsample weights (for the LDL analyses), which accounted for the 
complex multistage probability sampling design of the NHANES survey. (16) We used 
appropriate morning fasting subsample weights for the subgroup of participants with data 
available on both LDL-cholesterol and family history (2005–06 to 2011–12), according to 
NCHS instructions.(16) Standard errors were obtained using first-order Taylor series 
linearization.(17) Confidence intervals were constructed using logit transformation for 
subgroups with positive numbers of individuals at elevated risk, or an exact binomial method 
for subgroups with 0 individuals at elevated risk.(9, 18) These prevalence estimates were 
intended to represent the civilian, non-institutionalized US population aged ≥20 years. We 
compared differences in the proportion of participants with elevated LDL-cholesterol levels 
between those with vs. without family history of premature ASCVD, using Pearson’s chi-
square test and appropriate sample weights to account for the survey design. In sensitivity 
analyses, we included participants who were taking lipid-lowering drugs and estimated their 
lipid profiles (and corresponding 10-year ASCVD risk) in absence of these medications. 
Specifically, based on prior studies, we assumed that lipid-lowering drugs lowered TC by 
21.18% and raised HDL-C by 3.57%.(19) All analyses accounted for complex survey design 
and appropriate subgroup weighting. NHANES analyses were performed using the “svy” 
prefix to the “prop” command (with the “subpop” option for subpopulations, such as 
individuals with LDL ≥190 mg/dL) and the “over” option for between-group comparisons, 
(such as males vs. females) in STATA/MP 13.1 (College Station, TX).

 Results
Out of 10,862 NHANES participants between the ages of 30 and 49 years, 1,003 were 
excluded for having diabetes (n=735) or ASCVD or its equivalents (stroke n=116, coronary 
artery disease n=72, other cardiovascular disease n=223) or missing data (n=197) and 251 
were excluded because they were already on statin therapy at the time of their visit. Our final 
population consisted of 9,608 adults representing 67.9 million US adults. The characteristics 
of the population are described in Table 1.
Overall, 9.1% (95% CI: 8.3%, 9.9%) of adults had a 10-year estimated ASCVD risk greater 
than 5% (i.e. elevated risk). Table 2 shows the percentage of patients with elevated 
cardiovascular risk in subgroups of young adults divided by age, gender and risk factors of 
smoking and hypertension. The percentage of elevated-risk adults varied substantially (from 
0% to 75.9%) by age, gender, smoking and hypertension status. In the absence of smoking 
or hypertension, adult men under the age of 40 and adult women under 50 years constituted 
the low prevalence subgroups (represented by shaded cells).
Of non-smoking, non-hypertensive women under the age of 50 years, 0.04% (95% CI: 0.0%, 
0.26%) had an elevated cardiovascular risk. Of non-smoking, non-hypertensive men under 
the age of 40 years, 0.09% (95% CI: 0.02%, 0.35%) had an elevated cardiovascular risk. 
About half of the young adult population aged 30 – 49 years (47.12%) was in the low 
prevalence subgroups. Of the few adults who had elevated risk in these low prevalence 
groups, all had a risk between 5.0% and 7.4% (Table 3). Non-smoking adults with 
hypertension had an intermediate prevalence of elevated risk (ranging from 0 – 29.3% 
depending on age and sex). At every age, smokers had the highest prevalence of elevated 
cardiovascular risk. Sensitivity analyses including patients who were taking lipid-lowering 
drugs demonstrated similar results and identified the same low prevalence subgroups, except 
that the 95% confidence interval for women without risk factors aged 45–49 crossed 1% 
(Appendix Table 1).
LDL cholesterol levels of at least 190 mg/dL were present in 2.9% (95% CI: 2.3%, 3.5%) of 
young adults in NHANES. Of these, 1.7% (95% CI: 1.1%, 2.4%) of adults in the low 
prevalence groups had an LDL level of at least 190 mg/dL. Based on our sample of 2562 
young adults aged 30–49 years who had both an LDL level and family history available, 
11.4% (95% CI: 9.9%, 12.9%) had a family history of premature ASCVD. The proportion of 
adults with LDL cholesterol levels ≥ 190 mg/dL in both men and women did not differ by 
family history (Table 4).
Discussion
In this cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative population, we found that the 
prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk was low in normotensive, non-smoking females 
younger than 50 years (~22.2 million women) and males younger than 40 years (~9.8 
million men). This group constituted one-half of the population aged 30–49 years, 
representing 32 million people. Only 1.7% (95% CI: 1.1%, 2.4%) of these low risk adults 
had an LDL level of at least 190 mg/dL, and they were no more likely to report a family

 history of premature heart attack than those with lower LDL levels. Given the low 
prevalence of patients at elevated cardiovascular risk, our findings would support the 
targeted approach of the USPSTF over the more general screening of the AHA/ACC. 
However, given the observed risk distribution, screening for adults without risk factors could 
begin at age 40 for men and 50 for women.
The primary purpose of checking serum cholesterol in healthy patients is to identify those 
who would benefit from lipid-lowering therapy. This includes patients with an elevated risk 
of developing cardiac events based on the Pooled Cohort equation, as well as patients whose 
cholesterol levels are extremely high, indicating probable familial hypercholesterolemia. It is 
thought that the latter group has an accelerated risk of developing ASCVD,(20) and 
initiation of statin treatment helps reduce their risk early in the course of treatment.(21, 22) 
The 2013 AHA/ACC guidelines recommend treatment with a statin for patients with a 10-
year risk of ≥7.5%, although statin treatment can be considered even at a risk of 5%.(5) In 
contrast, the USPSTF recommends treating only those patients with a 10-year risk of 10% 
and at least one cardiac risk factor.(23) We examined the probability of patients having a risk 
>5% to decide a priori whether testing made sense. As the data are sparse regarding risk 
prediction for the young adult population,(4, 7) we extrapolated the Pooled Cohort equations 
to this subgroup. For young patients without risk factors, we found that very few (<0.5%) 
had a calculated risk >5%. Moreover, this threshold may be overly aggressive, as several 
studies have found that the Pooled Cohort equation overestimates risk in low risk patients 
(11, 12) especially women.(10) Using a higher threshold (e.g. 7.5%) would make screening 
these groups even less efficient, as there were not patients in these subgroups with a risk 
>7.5%. Some might argue that patients with risk levels in the 1–4% range should be made 
aware of their risk so that they can undertake therapeutic lifestyle changes. However, there is 
no evidence that showing patients they are at low risk will prompt positive behavior changes 
and could even have the opposite effect. If the patients chose not to make lifestyle changes, 
it would be unfortunate, since a healthy lifestyle, including proper diet and exercise, is 
beneficial for preventing both cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular diseases, and can be 
recommended for all, regardless of cholesterol level.(24)
Another argument for testing and potentially treating younger patients has to do with 
lifetime cardiac risk.(5) Although ten-year risks may be low, preventing atherosclerosis 
could prevent disease 20, 30 or even 40 years in the future. However, there are no trials to 
inform such a strategy, and treatment at later years is so effective (25) that it is unclear how 
much additional benefit would result from initiating treatment early.(7) Moreover, treatment 
with statins may increase risk for diabetes,(26) which could outweigh cardiovascular 
benefits in younger patients. More research is needed before statins can be recommended 
based on lifetime risk alone.
Lastly, universal screening could be used to identify people with familial hyperlipidemia, 
who experience early disease (20) and might benefit from early treatment with statins. A 
recent NHANES analysis estimated the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia as 1 in 
250 using clinical criteria, with prevalence rising with increasing age and obesity.(27) 
However, only a very small fraction of patients with LDL cholesterol ≥190 mg/dL have a 
mutation for familial hyperlipidemia.(28) Identifying a broader population as potentially

 having familial hyperlipidemia could lead to more testing or potentially to overtreatment. In 
the present study, 2.9% of the population had LDL cholesterol values of at least 190 mg/dL, 
90% of whom presumably do not have familial hypercholesterolemia. Moreover, such 
patients were not more likely to have a family history of premature ASCVD.
The distribution of ASCVD risk in adults below the age of 50 years has been studied by 
others. In a study using earlier data from NHANES, 95.7% of adults aged 30–39 years and 
89.7% of adults aged 40–49 years had a 10-year risk <10% based on Framingham risk 
equation in the absence of ASCVD or risk equivalents.(29) Because this study preceded the 
2013 guidelines, they did not address the 5% threshold. In a more recent analysis of risk 
distribution using the Pooled Cohort equations in NHANES, 86.6% of adults (78.1% of men 
and 95.2% of women) aged 40–50 years had a risk of <5%. This analysis considered all 
adults, including those with ASCVD, diabetes and other risk equivalents.(4) More 
importantly, these studies did not examine the risk distribution of different subgroups based 
on individual risk factors like smoking and hypertension. This is important because one 
could argue that if 4% of the population between 30 and 39 years of age has a risk of >10%, 
repeated screening of this age group is reasonable. Our study reveals that the overwhelming 
majority of those at high risk are smokers and, to a lesser degree, non-smokers with 
hypertension.
Our study has a number of strengths. We examined the prevalence of increased 
cardiovascular risk in a nationally representative sample of healthy young adults. By 
choosing risk factors that are readily available (age, sex, smoking status and hypertension) 
we could easily identify groups of patients for screening. In our sample, approximately one-
third of tests among men and two-thirds among women under age 50 years could be avoided 
with minimal effect. At the same time, our study emphasizes the importance of smoking as a 
risk factor in younger patients. Almost all smokers had at least a 5.5% chance of having 
elevated risk, regardless of age or sex. This mirrors a recent finding that for patients under 
50, smoking was associated with 8 times the risk of myocardial infarction faced by non-
smokers.(30)
Our study also has several limitations intrinsic to the NHANES study design. Risk factors 
and family history were self-reported by participants. LDL cholesterol values were present 
only in the morning examination subsample. We also excluded patients who were taking a 
statin or other lipid-lowering drug at their initial visit. Sensitivity analyses including those 
participants produced similar results. We measured predicted risk, not actual cardiovascular 
outcomes. However, because treatment under the ACC/AHA guidelines as well as the 
USPSTF guidelines are based on predicted risk, our analysis reveals the likelihood that 
screened patients would be eligible for treatment, which is strongly associated with reduced 
events.(31) Finally, we used a conservative risk cut-off of 5% to identify a population which 
might benefit from therapy directed towards lowering cholesterol levels. Some have argued 
that the ASCVD overestimates risk.(10, 11) Using a different calculator or a higher cutoff 
would make screening the low-prevalence population even less attractive.

 Conclusion
In a nationally representative adult population, the prevalence of elevated cardiovascular risk 
in absence of smoking or hypertension in men under the age of 40 years and women under 
the age of 50 years is low. There might be utility in one time screening of the entire 
population to identify patients with very high LDL cholesterol levels suggesting possible 
genetic hyperlipidemias. Targeted screening of young adults with a family history of 
premature heart disease is not more likely to identify patients with very high LDL 
cholesterol levels.
