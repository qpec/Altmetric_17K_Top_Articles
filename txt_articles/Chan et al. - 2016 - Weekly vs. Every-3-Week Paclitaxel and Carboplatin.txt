BACKGROUND
A dose-dense weekly schedule of paclitaxel (resulting in a greater frequency of drug 
delivery) plus carboplatin every 3 weeks or the addition of bevacizumab to paclitaxel 
and carboplatin administered every 3 weeks has shown efficacy in ovarian cancer. We 
proposed to determine whether dose-dense weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin would 
prolong progression-free survival as compared with paclitaxel and carboplatin admin-
istered every 3 weeks among patients receiving and those not receiving bevacizumab.
METHODS
We prospectively stratified patients according to whether they elected to receive beva-
cizumab and then randomly assigned them to receive either paclitaxel, administered 
intravenously at a dose of 175 mg per square meter of body-surface area every 3 weeks, 
plus carboplatin (dose equivalent to an area under the curve [AUC] of 6) for six cycles 
or paclitaxel, administered weekly at a dose of 80 mg per square meter, plus carbopla-
tin (AUC, 6) for six cycles. The primary end point was progression-free survival.
RESULTS
A total of 692 patients were enrolled, 84% of whom opted to receive bevacizumab. In the 
intention-to-treat analysis, weekly paclitaxel was not associated with longer progression-
free survival than paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (14.7 months and 14.0 months, 
respectively; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.89; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], 0.74 to 1.06; P 
= 
0.18). Among patients who did not receive bevacizumab, weekly 
paclitaxel was associated with progression-free survival that was 3.9 months longer than 
that observed with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (14.2 vs. 10.3 months; hazard 
ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.95; P 
= 
0.03). However, among patients who received beva-
cizumab, weekly paclitaxel did not significantly prolong progression-free survival, as 
compared with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (14.9 months and 14.7 months, 
respectively; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.20; P 
= 
0.60). A test for interaction that 
assessed homogeneity of the treatment effect showed a significant difference between 
treatment with bevacizumab and without bevacizumab (P 
= 
0.047). Patients who received 
weekly paclitaxel had a higher rate of grade 3 or 4 anemia than did those who received 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks (36% vs. 16%), as well as a higher rate of grade 2 to 4 sensory 
neuropathy (26% vs. 18%); however, they had a lower rate of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia 
(72% vs. 83%).
CONCLUSIONS
Overall, weekly paclitaxel, as compared with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks, did 
not prolong progression-free survival among patients with ovarian cancer. (Funded by

Weekly vs. Every-3-Week Paclitaxel for Ovarian Cancer
O
varian cancer, the most lethal 
gynecologic cancer, is responsible for 
approximately 14,000 deaths in the Unit-
ed States annually.1 The incorporation of bevaci-
zumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular 
endothelial growth factor, in the treatment regi-
men prolongs progression-free survival but not 
overall survival.2-5 A dose-dense regimen of pa-
clitaxel involving greater frequency of drug deliv-
ery may enhance its antineoplastic effect by elicit-
ing antiangiogenic and proapoptotic properties.6-9
Weekly paclitaxel therapy prolonged survival 
among patients with early-stage breast cancer 
and those with metastatic breast cancer.10,11 In a 
study involving patients with ovarian cancer, 
Japanese investigators found that dose-dense 
weekly paclitaxel prolonged progression-free sur-
vival and overall survival, as compared with treat-
ment administered every 3 weeks, which is the 
conventional regimen.12,13 In a Multicenter Italian 
Trials in Ovarian Cancer study of weekly pacli-
taxel combined with weekly carboplatin, the inves-
tigators did not find a benefit of weekly therapy 
over treatment administered every 3 weeks; how-
ever, paclitaxel was not administered in a dose-
dense method.14
The encouraging clinical-trial results regard-
ing treatment with dose-dense paclitaxel and 
bevacizumab in patients with ovarian and other 
cancers led to the design of the current study. 
We aimed to determine whether in the primary 
treatment of ovarian cancer, dose-dense weekly 
paclitaxel combined with carboplatin would pro-
long progression-free survival, as compared 
with paclitaxel and carboplatin administered every 
3 weeks, among patients receiving and those not 
receiving bevacizumab.
Methods
Patients
Eligibility criteria included newly diagnosed, 
untreated, incompletely resected stage III or 
any stage IV epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, 
or primary peritoneal cancer. After the closure 
of a competing trial, Gynecologic Oncology 
Group (GOG)–0252 (ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT00951496), patients with stage II or stage III 
disease with no residual lesions that were larger 
than 1 cm in the greatest dimension were also 
included. In addition, patients who desired to 
undergo neoadjuvant therapy were permitted to 
be included in the trial. The histologic findings 
were reviewed centrally by the GOG pathology 
committee. All the patients had a GOG perfor-
mance-status score of 0 (fully active) to 2 (ambu-
latory and capable of self-care but unable to 
work; up and about >50% of waking hours). All 
the patients provided written informed consent.
Study Oversight
The NRG Oncology–Gynecologic Oncology Group 
and GOG designed and conducted the trial. The 
study was approved by the research ethics board 
at each participating center or by a central insti-
tutional review board. The data were collected, 
held, and analyzed by the NRG Oncology–Gyne-
cologic Oncology Group and GOG, with reviews 
by the data and safety monitoring committee. 
The first author (study chair) vouches for the 
integrity of the data and analyses reported and 
for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol, avail-
able with the full text of this article at NEJM.org. 
The first author wrote the manuscript with input 
from all the coauthors.
The National Cancer Institute distributed 
bevacizumab to the GOG under a cooperative 
research and development agreement. Genen-
tech provided supplemental support to the GOG. 
Representatives from the sponsors (the Cancer 
Therapy Evaluation Program of the National 
Cancer Institute and Genentech) reviewed the 
protocol and the manuscript, but the final con-
tent was determined by the authors. The proto-
col amendments and statistical analysis plan are 
available with the protocol at NEJM.org.
Study Design
GOG-0262 was an open-label, randomized phase 
3 trial that was designed to compare two regi-
mens. Regimen 1 was paclitaxel, administered 
intravenously at a dose of 175 mg per square 
meter of body-surface area over a period of 
3 hours on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, plus a carbo-
platin dose in milligrams (in a dose equivalent 
to an area under the curve [AUC] of 6), also 
administered intravenously on day 1 of the cycle, 
for six cycles. Regimen 2 was paclitaxel, admin-
istered intravenously at a dose of 80 mg per 
square meter over a period of 1 hour on days 1, 
8, and 15 of a 21-day cycle, plus carboplatin 
(AUC, 6), administered intravenously on day 1 of 
the cycle, for six cycles.
During the design of the current study in 
2010, the GOG completed protocol 218, which 
showed that the addition of bevacizumab to

chemotherapy significantly prolonged progres-
sion-free survival in a similar population of pa-
tients with ovarian cancer. Therefore, the current 
study provided bevacizumab to each patient who 
chose to receive it. The patients were prospec-
tively stratified according to whether they elect-
ed to receive bevacizumab; they were then ran-
domly assigned to receive weekly paclitaxel or 
paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks.
In the case of patients who elected to receive 
bevacizumab, the drug was administered at a 
dose of 15 mg per kilogram of body weight every 
21 days beginning with the second cycle of 
therapy and continuing until the onset of dis-
ease progression or until an adverse event pre-
cluded further therapy. Patients undergoing neo-
adjuvant 
chemotherapy 
with 
interval 
cytoreductive 
surgery after core-needle biopsy were to receive 
three cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, fol-
lowed by interval cytoreductive surgery between 
cycles 3 and 4, and then three additional cycles 
of chemotherapy. In this case, if bevacizumab 
was chosen, it was to be administered during 
cycles 2, 5, and 6 but omitted during cycles 1, 
3, and 4.
Before the initiation of study treatment, dis-
ease was assessed by means of computed tomog-
raphy or magnetic resonance imaging, measure-
ment of the serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) 
level, and physical examination.15 Imaging was 
repeated after chemotherapy cycles 3 and 6. Serum 
CA-125 levels were measured and physical exami-
nations were performed at the beginning of each 
chemotherapy cycle. After the completion of 
chemotherapy, imaging, serum CA-125 measure-
ments, and physical examination were repeated 
every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months 
for 3 years, and then annually.
The Trial Outcome Index of the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT)–Ovary 
(FACT-O TOI) was used to capture data on pa-
tient-reported assessments (on a scale from 0 to 
4, with higher scores indicating better health-
related quality of life; see the Supplementary 
Appendix).16,17 Patient-reported outcomes were 
analyzed for patients who underwent primary 
cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy. 
The neurotoxicity subscale short form (FACT/
GOG-NTX) and the abdominal-discomfort sub-
scale short form (FACT-GOG-AD) were used to 
capture patients’ self-reported chemotherapy-
induced neuropathy and abdominal discomfort, 
respectively. Patients are asked to answer each 
question, as it applied during the previous 7 days, 
with the use of a 5-point scale that ranged from 
“not at all” (0) to “a little bit” (1) to “somewhat” 
(2) to “quite a bit” (3) to “very much” (4). The 
FACT-O TOI scores were assessed by means of a 
linear mixed-effects model. The minimally im-
portant difference in FACT-O TOI scores is be-
tween 5.2 and 7.8 units (see the Supplementary 
Appendix).16
Safety and toxic effects were closely moni-
tored during every cycle. The use of myeloid 
growth factor was allowed in order to treat 
grade 4 neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count, 
<500 per cubic millimeter) that persisted for 7 
days or more or febrile neutropenia or as subse-
quent prophylaxis. In patients with hypersensi-
tivity or dose-limiting peripheral neuropathy 
that was due to paclitaxel, the drug was replaced 
with docetaxel (at a dose of 75 mg per square 
meter). Delay or discontinuation of bevacizumab 
was allowed if the patient had uncontrolled hyper-
tension, proteinuria, wound or bowel-wall disrup-
tion, intestinal obstruction, or vascular disorders.
Statistical Analysis
At the time of randomization, a minimization 
procedure was performed to ensure that nearly 
equal numbers of patients received each study 
treatment on the basis of the following factors: 
GOG performance-status score, disease stage, 
status with respect to cytoreduction procedure 
(yes vs. no), and the decisions to use or not use 
bevacizumab or neoadjuvant therapy.18 The pri-
mary study end point was progression-free 
survival. The onset of clinical progression was 
defined as either radiographic evidence of in-
creasing disease on the basis of the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 
criteria, version 1.1,19 or an overall deterioration 
in health or a rise in the CA-125 level as assessed 
with the use of the Gynecologic Cancer Inter-
Group criteria.20
Data on progression-free survival were cen-
sored at the date of last contact for those patients 
who remained alive and free from disease pro-
gression.18 Equivalence of the hazard of disease 
progression or death between the two treatment 
groups was assessed by means of a stratified log-
rank test.21 The Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events, version 4.0, of the National Cancer 
Institute were used to grade the adverse events.

Weekly vs. Every-3-Week Paclitaxel for Ovarian Cancer
The stratification factors for the log-rank 
procedure were the initial performance-status 
score (0 vs. 1 vs. 2), stage of disease according 
to the International Federation of Gynecology 
and Obstetrics staging system (II vs. III vs. IV), 
option to receive bevacizumab (yes vs. no), and 
option to undergo neoadjuvant treatment (yes vs. 
no). The final analysis was to occur when at least 
414 events of disease progression or death had 
been reported. We calculated that if weekly pa-
clitaxel is truly associated with a rate of disease 
progression or death that is 25% less than that 
with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks, this 
number of events would provide the study with 
approximately 90% power to detect this differ-
ence while limiting the overall one-sided type I 
error to 2.5%. A proportional-hazards model 
was used to estimate the treatment hazard ratio 
and its corresponding confidence interval, as well 
as to perform interaction tests between the ran-
domly assigned treatment and the four design 
stratification factors (initial performance-status 
score, size of residual disease, option to receive 
bevacizumab, and option to undergo neoadjuvant 
treatment). A linear mixed-effects model that 
included the covariates of baseline score, age, 
stage of disease, and bevacizumab option was 
used to assess the hypothesis that the mean 
patient-reported outcome scores for the study 
treatments would be equivalent. All the reported 
P values are two-sided.
Results
Study Patients
A total of 692 patients with newly diagnosed, 
previously untreated ovarian cancer were enrolled 
from September 2010 through February 2012 at 
more than 209 clinics in the United States, 
Canada, and South Korea. The prespecified 
number of events that was required for the 
analysis of progression-free survival occurred in 
June 2013, and the survival data were updated 
for this report in August 2015. The enrollment, 
randomization, and follow-up of the study pa-
tients are shown in Figure 1. Of the 692 patients, 
85% were non-Hispanic whites. A total of 3% of 
the patients had stage II disease, 67% had stage 
III disease, and 30% had stage IV disease. Most 
of the patients (611 patients [88%]) had serous 
histologic findings, and 63% (438) had gross 
residual disease. A total of 84% of the patients 
(580 patients) opted to receive bevacizumab, and 
13% (88) had neoadjuvant chemotherapy fol-
lowed by interval cytoreductive surgery (Table 1). 
After central eligibility review, 32 patients (4.6%; 
16 patients in each treatment group) were 
deemed to be ineligible or had incompletely 
documentation of eligibility.
Efficacy
After a median follow-up of 28 months, 67% of 
the patients were alive. In the overall intention-
to-treat analysis, weekly paclitaxel did not ap-
preciably prolong progression-free survival, as 
compared with paclitaxel administered every 
3 weeks (14.7 months and 14.0 months, respec-
tively; hazard ratio for disease progression or 
death, 0.89; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74 to 
1.06; P 
= 
0.18) (Fig. 2A). Sensitivity analyses that 
included only eligible patients were consistent 
with the intention-to-treat analyses. A Kaplan–

Patients who were randomly assigned to dose-dense therapy received pacli-
taxel at a dose of 80 mg per square meter of body-surface area on days 1, 8, 
and 15 of a 21-day cycle, plus a carboplatin dose in milligrams (dose equiva-
lent to an area under the curve [AUC] of 6) on day 1 of the cycle, for six cycles; 
patients who were assigned to the conventional regimen received paclitaxel 
at a dose of 175 mg per square meter on day 1 of a 21-day cycle, plus carbo-
platin (AUC, 6) on day 1 of the cycle, for six cycles. Patients in either group 
could opt to receive bevacizumab, starting from cycle 2, at a dose of 15 mg 
per kilogram of body weight, every 3 weeks until disease progression occurred.

Table 1. Demographic and Clinicopathological Characteristics of the Patients, According to Treatment Group.*
Figure 2 (facing page). Primary and Subgroup Analyses of Progression-free Survival, According to Treatment Group.
In the overall intention-to-treat analysis, dose-dense weekly therapy with paclitaxel did not prolong progression-free sur-
vival, as compared with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (14.7 months and 14.0 months, respectively) (Panel A). 
In the case of progression-free survival, the hazard ratio is for disease progression or death. In the overall intention-to-
treat analysis, weekly paclitaxel did not prolong overall survival, as compared with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks 
(Panel B). In the case of overall survival, the hazard ratio is for death. No P value is available for the analysis of overall 
survival because the prespecified number of events has not occurred yet for this analysis. In the analysis of progression-
free survival among patients who opted not to receive bevacizumab, weekly paclitaxel was associated with progression-
free survival that was 3.9 months longer than that observed with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (14.2 vs. 10.3 
months; hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 0.95; P = 0.03) (Panel C). In the analysis of 
progression-free survival among patients who opted to receive bevacizumab, weekly paclitaxel did not prolong progres-
sion-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (14.9 months and 14.7 months, respectively; 
hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.20; P = 0.60) (Panel D). A forest plot of progression-free survival, according to ran-
domized treatment, in subgroups defined according to prognostic factors is also shown (Panel E). Performance-status 
scores ranged from 0 (fully active) to 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care but unable to work; up and about >50% 
of waking hours). In the subgroup of patients with stage II disease, there were too few patients to reliably estimate the 
treatment hazard ratio. The size of residual disease was not assessed in patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
Meier plot of overall survival, with data updated 
in August 2015, is shown in Figure 2B (hazard 
ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.72 to 1.23).
We performed an interaction test between 
randomly assigned treatments and each stratifi-
cation factor (size of residual disease, option to 
receive neoadjuvant treatment, and option to re-
ceive bevacizumab) across strata. The effect of 
the paclitaxel regimen on progression-free sur-
vival did not differ significantly between patients 
who were left with microscopic residual disease 
and those who were left with macroscopic resid-
ual disease, nor did it differ significantly between 
those who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy fol-
lowed by interval cytoreduction and those who 
received primary cytoreduction.
However, the effect was dissimilar among the 
group of patients who opted to receive bevaci-
zumab versus the group of those who opted not 
to receive bevacizumab (P 
= 
0.047 for interaction) 
(Fig. 2E) Among patients who opted not to re-
ceive bevacizumab, weekly paclitaxel was associ-
ated with a median progression-free survival that 
was 3.9 months longer than that observed with 
paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks (14.2 vs. 
10.3 months; hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.40 to 
0.95; P 
= 
0.03), after adjustment for performance-
status score, disease stage, and residual disease 
status (Fig. 2C). However, among patients who 
opted to receive bevacizumab, progression-free 
survival was similar in the group that received 
weekly paclitaxel and the group that received 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks (14.9 months and 14.7 
months, respectively; hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% CI, 
0.83 to 1.20; P 
= 
0.60) (Fig. 2D).
Quality of Life
A total of 560 patients (277 patients receiving 
weekly paclitaxel and 283 receiving paclitaxel 
every 3 weeks) could be evaluated for patient-
reported outcomes. After adjustment for baseline 
scores, age, disease stage, and option to receive 
bevacizumab, patients who received weekly pa-
clitaxel reported lower scores on the FACT-O 
TOI (reflecting lower quality of life) during the 
assessment period than did those who received 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks. The maximum decrease 
in the FACT-O TOI score was 2.7 points (97.5% 
CI, −5.44 to 0.02; P 
= 
0.02) after completion of six 
cycles of chemotherapy, but this difference was 
not clinically significant.17 Although the inci-
dence of patient-reported neuropathy was similar 
in the two treatment groups, the patient-reported 
severity of the neuropathy was greater among 
those receiving weekly paclitaxel than among 
those receiving paclitaxel every 3 weeks, and 
that finding persisted throughout the study pe-
riod (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). 
The health-related quality-of-life scores among 
the 16% of patients who did not receive bevaci-
zumab did not differ significantly between the 
two study groups.
Safety
In the overall study population, the most com-
mon adverse events of grade 3 or higher were 
neutropenia (in 78% of the patients), gastroin-
testinal disorders (in 21%, including 2% who 
had gastrointestinal-wall disruption, such as per-
foration, fistula, or necrosis), thrombocytopenia 
(in 18%), infection (in 4%), and anemia (in 26%) 
(Table 2). Anemia of grade 3 or higher was re-
ported in 36% (124 of 340 patients) of the pa-
tients who received weekly paclitaxel, as com-
pared with 16% of those (54 of 343) treated with 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks (P<0.001). However, 
neutropenia of grade 3 or higher occurred less 
often in the group that received weekly pacli-
taxel than in the group that received paclitaxel 
every 3 weeks (72% [246 of 340 patients] vs. 83% 
[286 of 343], P<0.001).
Patients who received weekly paclitaxel were 
more likely than those who received paclitaxel 
every 3 weeks to receive a cytokine (30% vs. 
22%, P 
= 
0.02) or red-cell transfusion (55% vs. 
23%, P<0.001). Although there was no signifi-
cant between-group difference in the incidence 
of sensory neuropathy of grade 3 or higher, more 
patients in the group that received weekly pacli-
taxel than in the group that received paclitaxel 
every 3 weeks had sensory neuropathy of grade 2 
or higher (26% [88 of 340 patients] vs. 18% [61 of 
343], P 
= 
0.01). A total of 14 deaths (6 in the 
group that received weekly paclitaxel and 8 in 
the group that received paclitaxel every 3 weeks) 
were considered by the investigators to be at 
least possibly related to the study intervention. 
Of the 6 patients randomly assigned to receive 
weekly paclitaxel, 3 died from sepsis, 1 from 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage, 1 from ventricu-
lar fibrillation, and 1 from a nonspecific cause. 
Of the 8 patients randomly assigned to receive 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks, 3 died from sepsis, 
1 from respiratory failure, 1 from myocardial

Discussion
Among patients with ovarian cancer in a Japa-
nese Gynecologic Oncologic Group (JGOG) trial, 
dose-dense weekly paclitaxel was associated with 
longer overall survival than was treatment as 
conventionally administered every 3 weeks.12 The 
greater number of infusions and longer duration 
of paclitaxel exposure with a dose-dense regimen 
enhance intratumoral drug perfusion and inhibit 
angiogenesis.6-9 In addition, two randomized 
prospective trials showed that bevacizumab, a 
monoclonal antibody against vascular endothe-
lial growth factor, was associated with longer 
progression-free survival than was placebo.2,3 
However, these two trials used a regimen of 
paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks rather 
than weekly. The current study combined dose-
dense weekly paclitaxel with bevacizumab to 
target angiogenesis. The overall results of our 
study showed that a regimen of weekly pacli-
taxel did not prolong progression-free survival 
as compared with a regimen of treatment every 
3 weeks. However, among patients who did not 
receive bevacizumab, weekly paclitaxel led to 
progression-free survival that was 3.9 months 
longer than that observed with paclitaxel admin-
istered every 3 weeks.
On the basis of results from two prior trials,2,3 
we anticipated that bevacizumab would have an 
effect on progression-free survival. Therefore, our 
randomization procedure promoted a balance of 
bevacizumab use across the study treatments. 
We performed prespecified analyses that were 
aimed at assessing the consistency of the pri-
mary findings across various subgroups of pa-
tients; the results of these analyses suggested 
that weekly paclitaxel may have had a different 
effect in patients who did not receive bevaci-
zumab. This difference did not appear to be 
due to imbalances in known prognostic factors 
(Table S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). Never-
theless, the nonrandomization of bevacizumab 
use may have allowed for unknown biases re-
lated to the characteristics of patients who opted 
to receive bevacizumab. It is important to note 
that these analyses did not arise from any pre-
specified hypotheses and were based on only 
16% of the overall study cohort. Although the 
subgroup analyses were not part of the primary 
analysis, these types of analyses have served to 
guide drug approvals in subgroups of patients 
within randomized trials.22
In the subgroup of patients who did not re-
ceive bevacizumab, dose-dense weekly paclitaxel 
was associated with longer progression-free 
survival than was paclitaxel administered every 
3 weeks (14.2 vs. 10.3 months; hazard ratio for 
progression or death, 0.62). These findings were 
consistent with results in the group that received 
weekly paclitaxel in the JGOG trial (17.2 months, 
vs. 28.0 months in the group that received pacli-
taxel every 3 weeks; hazard ratio, 0.71).12 How-
ever, the aggregated analysis of our study did 
not show an effect of weekly paclitaxel. This 
result may be due to the fact that 84% of the 
patients in our trial elected to receive bevaci-
zumab. Thus, it is possible that the overall dif-
ference was dominated by the addition of beva-
cizumab to the study treatment. However, we 
cannot dismiss the fact that this difference 
could be due to an imbalance of unknown prog-
nostic factors.
Weekly paclitaxel was associated with a higher 
rate of sensory neuropathy of grade 2 or higher, 
as well as higher patient-reported neurotoxicity 
scores, than was paclitaxel administered every 
3 weeks. The JGOG investigators did not find a 
higher rate of neuropathy associated with week-
ly paclitaxel than with paclitaxel administered 
every 3 weeks, but this result may have been due 
to the higher rate of discontinuation of treat-
ment in the weekly dosing group.12 Although 
weekly paclitaxel did not affect the rate of sen-
sory neuropathy of grade 3 or higher in our 
study, it was associated with a lower rate of 
neuropathy of grade 3 or higher than was pacli-
taxel administered every 3 weeks in a trial in-
volving patients with breast cancer.10
We found a significantly lower rate of neutro-
penia of grade 3 or higher with weekly pac-
litaxel than with paclitaxel administered every 
3 weeks, whereas the JGOG investigators found 
more treatment delays due to neutropenia in the 
group receiving weekly paclitaxel, although the 
difference was not significant. Although we did 
not identify a difference in the rate of neutrope-
nic fever, prior studies have shown a lower rate 
of neutropenic fever in groups receiving weekly

Weekly vs. Every-3-Week Paclitaxel for Ovarian Cancer
paclitaxel than in those receiving paclitaxel 
every 3 weeks.10,23 We also found a higher rate of 
anemia of grade 3 or higher in the group receiv-
ing weekly paclitaxel than in the group receiving 
paclitaxel every 3 weeks. The rate of severe ane-
mia in the group that received weekly paclitaxel 
in the JGOG study was 69%, which may be at-
tributed to the higher dose of paclitaxel used in 
that study, the pharmacokinetic differences be-
tween the two patient populations, or both.12,24,25 
We did not identify any toxic effects that were 
due to the combined use of paclitaxel and beva-
cizumab.
The survival among patients with ovarian can-
cer in Japan and Europe varies from the survival 
we observed in this study involving patients who 
were primarily from the United States.12-14 A re-
cent population-based study with the use of data 
from the National Cancer Institute showed that 
Asian patients had a higher rate of survival than 
whites.26 Pharmacogenomic variations between 
these groups of patients with respect to treat-
ment response and toxic effects may partially 
explain these differences in outcome.27,28
Among patients who received bevacizumab in 
our study, weekly paclitaxel did not prolong 
progression-free survival as compared with pa-
clitaxel administered every 3 weeks. Similarly, in 
a randomized trial involving patients with meta-
static breast cancer, investigators did not find a 
difference in response rate among patients who 
received treatment with paclitaxel combined with 
bevacizumab every week, those who received the 
regimen every 2 weeks, and those who received 
it every 3 weeks in first-line treatment.29 Further-
more, the dose of antivascular drug may influ-
ence vascular normalization.30,31 Lower doses of 
an antivascular drug might improve perfusion 
and drug delivery, whereas higher doses can lead 
to rapid vessel pruning that results in less drug 
delivery and more metastasis.32,33 The results of 
this study may be further validated in the Inter-
national Collaborative Ovarian Neoplasm Trial 
protocol (ICON) 8B trial (NCT01654146).
In patients with recurrent platinum-resistant 
ovarian cancer, the addition of bevacizumab to 
chemotherapy (pegylated doxorubicin, topotecan, 
or weekly paclitaxel) prolonged progression-free 
survival as compared with chemotherapy alone.5 
Moreover, there was a more pronounced effect in 
the subgroup of patients who received weekly 
paclitaxel than in the other subgroups. However, 
the sample size was small and there was no 
randomization to different chemotherapies.5 
Clearly, the scheduling of taxanes and other che-
motherapies combined with biologic therapy in 
initial treatment versus therapy in the context of 
recurrent disease warrants further investigation.
In addition, comparative effectiveness studies 
are needed with consideration of economic 
costs. Although paclitaxel and carboplatin ad-
ministered every 3 weeks and combined with 
bevacizumab may be more convenient than 
weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin without beva-
cizumab, the every-3-week regimen is also as-
sociated with higher costs, with an incremental 
cost-effectiveness ratio as calculated by others of 
$401,088 versus $5,809 per progression-free 
life–year saved.34-36
In conclusion, our data suggest that weekly 
paclitaxel did not prolong progression-free sur-
vival, as compared with paclitaxel administered 
every 3 weeks, among patients with ovarian 
cancer.
