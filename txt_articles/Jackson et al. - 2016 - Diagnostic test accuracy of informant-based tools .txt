Abstract
Background: delirium and dementia co-exist commonly in hospital. Older people with delirium have high rates of undiag-
nosed dementia, but delirium affects the use of cognitive testing in dementia diagnosis. Novel methods to detect dementia
in delirium are needed. The purpose of the study was to investigate the diagnostic test accuracy of informant tools to detect
dementia in hospitalised older people with delirium.
Methods: the presence of dementia on admission was assessed using the short form of the Informant Questionnaire of
Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE-SF) and Alzheimer’s Disease 8 (AD8) in people over 70 years old with delirium.
Reference standard diagnosis was made using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV)
criteria at 3 months. The main outcome measures were the diagnostic test accuracy of the IQCODE-SF and the AD8 in diag-
nosing DSM-IV dementia.
Results: dementia prevalence at 3 months was 61%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was
0.93 (P < 0.0005) for admission IQCODE-SF and 0.91 (P < 0.0005) for admission AD8. An IQCODE-SF test result of
>3.82 on admission had a sensitivity of 0.91 (0.79–0.97) and specificity of 0.93 (0.76–0.99) for detecting dementia. An AD8 of
>6 had a sensitivity of 0.83 (0.69–0.92) and specificity of 0.90 (0.72–0.97) for detecting dementia.
Conclusion: the IQCODE-SF and AD8 are sensitive and specific tools to detect prior dementia in older people with delirium.
The routine use of either tool in practice could have important clinical impact, by improving the recognition and hence
management of those with dementia.

Introduction
Dementia is a chronic neurodegenerative disease charac-
terised by progressive cognitive decline, amnesic deficits and
functional deficits [1]. Dementia is common among older
hospital patients. In acute medical admissions, cognitive im-
pairment affects 50% [2] and dementia up to 42% [3, 4].
Older patients with dementia have higher rates of adverse
events in hospital [5] as well as higher mortality and institu-
tionalisation [6]. However, dementia in this population is
under-recognised, with up to a half of older patients in hos-
pital with dementia not having a recognised diagnosis [3].
Delirium is a severe neuropsychiatric syndrome charac-
terised by an acute change in cognition, attentional deficits
505

 and altered arousal [7]. Delirium is also common in older
hospital inpatients, affecting 15–25% of acute admissions [2,
8]. Apart from age, cognitive impairment is the most import-
ant risk factor for delirium [9]. Therefore, older patients with
delirium are a key target population to improve identification
of dementia within the general hospital.
Few traditional performance-based assessments (cogni-
tive tests) for dementia have been validated in the general
hospital, and they are not valid in the context of patients with
delirium [10]. As delirium, by definition, is associated with an
acute cognitive change from baseline, novel strategies to iden-
tify dementia in delirium are required. Brief informant-based
screening tools with relatives and carers are thoroughly vali-
dated for community use [11] but have only been validated in
a single study in hospital inpatients [12] and not in those with
delirium.
The report aimed to assess the diagnostic test accuracy of
two informant tools to detect prior dementia in older patients
with current delirium.
Methods
Recruitment
Patients aged 70 and over with an unplanned medical admis-
sion to a United Kingdom university hospital between March
2013 and November 2014 were screened for delirium. The
screening used the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)
[13], Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS) [14], the Digit
Span test and a detailed review of the medical notes. An
expert geriatrician (T.A.J.) completed all screening. If partici-
pants met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders fourth edition (DSM-IV-TR) criteria for delirium
[15], they were eligible for the study. Potential participants
who were unable to communicate because of severe sensory
impairment or inability to speak in English were excluded, as
were those deemed to be at risk of imminent death.
Patients with delirium were then invited to participate.
Informed consent was sought from the potential participant
if they had capacity. For those who lacked capacity to give
informed consent, the next of kin was consulted in accord-
ance with the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act with
respect to participation in research, and they were also
approached to act themselves as informants in the study.
Informed consent was then gained from the informants.
An informant interview enquired about previous diagno-
sis of dementia or cognitive impairment. The informant was
then asked to complete two rating scales in order. First the
short form of the Informant Questionnaire of Cognitive
Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE-SF) [16] and second, the
‘AD8: the Washington University Dementia Screening Test’,
also referred to as the Eight-item Interview to Differentiate
Aging and Dementia (AD8) [17]. These were chosen as they
are freely available and have face validity. After explanation of
the tests, they were then completed in private and placed in
an envelope to ensure appropriate blinding.
Informant tools
The IQCODE-SF asks the informant to rate changes in cog-
nition, memory and behaviours over a 10-year period. It has
been validated in primary care settings [11], community
settings [18] and secondary care settings [19] to diagnose de-
mentia. It takes �10 min to complete. The scale consists of
16 items rated 1 to 5 where higher scores indicate a greater
degree of cognitive impairment, from which a mean is
derived (also ranging from 1 to 5). In instances where ratings
were missing for an item, a mean score was calculated from
the items that were completed. The introductory wording
was changed to ‘Now we want you to remember what your
friend or relative was like 10 years ago and to compare it with
what he/she was like before they got the illness that brought
them to hospital’.
The AD8 is a shorter screening informant interview,
asking the informant to rate memory and thinking changes
over a few years, rating eight items yes, no or don’t know. It
takes 5 min to complete and has been found to be sensitive
and specific to dementia in a memory clinic population [65].
The test is scored from 0 to a maximum of 8, where higher
scores indicate a greater degree of cognitive impairment.
Missing values were assumed to be ‘don’t know’, so scored
as 0.
Reference standard
At 3 months, an assessment in survivors was undertaken to
determine a reference diagnosis of dementia at the time of
index admission. The assessment was carried out by T.A.J. at
the patient’s own home or hospital if they were still an in-
patient. The assessment was carried out blinded to the
results of the IQCODE-SF and AD8. It is not possible to
diagnose DSM-IV dementia in the presence of delirium, so
follow-up at 3 months was chosen as the best balance to
allow recovery from delirium and ensuring an accurate diag-
nosis of dementia at the index admission. The presence of
persistent delirium was first assessed for using DSM-IV-TR
criteria. If no delirium was present, a standardised history
and examination, including the Addenbrooke’s Cognitive
Examination III (ACEIII) [20], was performed to establish
the presence or absence of dementia at the time of index
admission (before the onset of the delirium). Dementia
and subtype was diagnosed using the DSM-IV criteria [21]:
(i) the development of multiple cognitive deficits, including
memory impairment, and (ii) the impairment is sufficiently
severe to cause impairment in occupational or social function.
To make the diagnosis of dementia at the index admission, the
symptoms of cognitive decline had to have been present for at
least 6 months prior to the admission with delirium.
Statistical analysis
Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for
both tests and a calculation of the area under the curve
(AUROC) was made. Sensitivity, specificity, the positive likeli-
hood ratio (LR+) and the negative likelihood ratio (LR−)
were calculated from the best cut-offs. In evaluating the

 relative misclassification costs in this population, we selected
cut-offs that minimised false-positive diagnoses, reducing the
burden of potentially stressful and unnecessary further inves-
tigation. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 20 for
Windows.
See Supplementary data, Appendix 1, available in Age and
Ageing online for details of the power calculations.
All assessments were carried out by a single trained asses-
sor (T.A.J.). The protocol was assessed and approved by the
Bradford Ethics Committee, part of the Yorkshire and Humber
National research and Ethics Service (Ref: 12/YH/0534). The
study was reported using the Standards for Reporting of
Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) statement with specific reference
to studies of diagnostic test accuracy in dementia [22,23] (check
list and flow chart available in Supplementary data, Appendix 2,
available in Age and Ageing online).
Results
Delirium was diagnosed in 228 (17.2%) of 1,327 older
people screened for delirium. One hundred and twenty-five
of this group of 228 (54.8%) were recruited. The main
reason for non-recruitment was the lack of an available con-
sultee or informant (57/228, 25%). 22/228 (10%) were
deemed at risk of imminent death, 15/228 (7%) were not
able to communicate in English, the consultee declined par-
ticipation in 2/228 (1%) and 7/228 (3%) had been previously
recruited.
Of the 125 recruited, 77 (62%) had a full assessment for
the reference standard diagnosis. 25/125 (20%) had died,
10/125 (8%) declined the follow-up visit, 8/125 (6%) were
not contactable for an assessment and 5/125 (4%) had per-
sistent delirium at assessment. There was no difference in
age, gender or admission dementia status between those
assessed for dementia at 3 months and those not. The mean
age of the final sample assessed for reference criterion diag-
nosis of dementia was 84.4 and 69% were female. Participant
flow through the study is illustrated in Figure 1.
At 3-month assessment, 47/77 (61%) were diagnosed
with dementia, 14/77 (18%) were diagnosed with MCI and
16/77 (21%) had no cognitive impairment. Of those with
dementia, this was newly diagnosed in 17/47 (36%).
In diagnosing DSM-IV dementia, the AUROC curve for
the admission IQCODE-SF was 0.93 (95% CI 0.86–1.00,
P < 0.0005) and for the admission AD8 it was 0.91 (95% CI
0.83–0.98, P < 0.0005). There was no statistical difference
between the AUROC curves (z = 0.45, P = 0.65) [24]. The
selected cut-off of >3.82 for the IQCODE-SF gave a sensi-
tivity of 0.91, a specificity of 0.93, an LR+ of 13.72 and an
LR− of 0.09. The selected cut-off of >6 for the AD8 gave a
sensitivity of 0.83, a specificity of 0.90, an LR+ of 8.30 and
an LR− of 0.19.
The traditional cut-off of the IQCODE-SF for diagnos-
ing dementia in the general hospital [25] is ≥3.44. Using this
cut-off gave a greater sensitivity of 0.98 at the expense of a
lower specificity of 0.67.
Table 1 illustrates the diagnostic test accuracy values for
the IQCODE-SF and AD8 including confidence intervals at
various cut-offs. See Supplementary data, Figure S1, available
in Age and Ageing online for the ROC curves for the
IQCODE-SF and AD8.
Discussion
The main new finding in this study is that we found excellent
diagnostic test accuracy of the IQCODE-SF and AD8
in diagnosing dementia in older people presenting with
delirium.
Specifically, we found that the IQCODE-SF and AD8
had excellent sensitivity, specificity and discriminatory ability.
An AUROC of >0.9 is considered excellent. Based on the
findings from this study, taking 100 older people with delir-
ium, IQCODE-SF at a cut-off of >3.82 would correctly
identify 56 of the 61 with dementia and would falsely imply a
diagnosis of dementia in 3 of the 39 without dementia.
Interpreting the likelihood ratios of the IQCODE-SF at a
cut-off of >3.82 to diagnose dementia, a positive test is 13
times more likely to occur in someone with dementia rather
than someone without dementia. A negative test is 0.07
times less likely to occur in someone with dementia rather
than someone without. This indicates good discrimination
after a test has been performed. A positive likelihood ratio of
>10 and a negative likelihood ratio of <0.1 indicates a test is
useful [26].
Neither the IQCODE-SF nor the AD8 has previously
been validated to diagnose dementia in patients with delir-
ium. One previous study has examined the diagnostic test ac-
curacy of the IQCODE-SF to diagnose dementia in older
hospital inpatients, excluding those with delirium. This
reported a sensitivity of 1.00 and specificity of 0.86 for
detecting DSM-IIIR dementia at a cut-off of >3.44 [12].
They report at ≥3.76 cut-off a sensitivity of 0.92 and specifi-
city of 0.93 for the IQCODE-SF, which are very similar to
our reported values. It is also worth noting that the preva-
lence of dementia was much lower (10%) in this study.
Although the IQCODE-SF has not been formally assessed
in people with delirium, it is commonly used as a proxy for
previous cognitive impairment in delirium research using dif-
ferent cut-offs. A cut-off of >3.5 has been used in a general
hospital population [27], and our findings suggest these
cut-offs may be too low.
Although both tests have similar diagnostic accuracy both
have advantages and disadvantages. The AD8 is simpler and
quicker to complete; however, it has a higher number of false
positives. The IQCODE-SF still only takes a maximum of
10 min to complete and the extra detail gathered may be of
clinical relevance. The IQCODE-SF has been translated into
14 languages. Both are freely available without cost [28, 29].
On balance, we would recommend using the IQCODE-SF
at a cut-off of >3.82 to detect dementia.
The study has important strengths and limitations.
The reported prevalence of delirium of 17.9% is similar to

 previous studies in acute admissions [8] indicating the screen-
ing was robust. We recognise the difficulty in diagnosing de-
mentia among patients in hospital with delirium, so strict
reference criteria were applied by an experienced and trained
specialist assessor. The assessor was blinded to the index test
result. We accept that the diagnosis of dementia before the
hospital admission with delirium could be affected by recall
bias and the presence of post-delirium cognitive impairment.
However, the assessor aimed to take this into account when
conducting his assessment. The diagnosis of prior cognitive

 impairment did not rely exclusively on cognitive testing at 3
months, but also on the clinical history. Therefore, we believe
the findings to be robust and are representative of a real
world general hospital. The study recruited to the appropri-
ately powered sample size. The study did not recruit all
patients diagnosed with delirium, the main reason being the
lack of an available consultee and/or informant. However,
there were no gender or age differences between those
recruited and those not. Not all participants were available
for reference diagnosis assessment at 3 months. The main
reason was mortality, with 25 (20%) having died prior follow-
up. This is in keeping with the expected mortality of delirium
[27] and importantly higher mortality would be expected in
those with dementia.
The other factor that could reduce the generalisability of
our findings is the non-availability of an informant. In our
study, one-quarter (57/228) of patients with delirium had no
informant available, so this may affect the utility of informant
tools in practice. However, the recruitment of an informant
in our study was time limited, so we feel in real world practice
this proportion would be lower. There was no difference in
age and gender between the recruited and non-recruited
groups. The informant information may also be affected by
recall bias as characteristics of the informant may influence
the result such as depression or cognitive impairment.
However, the strength of an informant tool is that it to some
extent mitigates problems with pre-existing educational back-
ground, culture or language difficulties.
The significance of our findings to the research commu-
nity is that the IQCODE-SF or AD8 at validated cut-offs
can now be used to robustly identify prior dementia in
studies of delirium cohorts in general hospital.
Our findings could impact significantly on clinical prac-
tice, given the high prevalence of delirium and unrecog-
nised dementia in the general hospital. Figure 2 is a flow
chart extrapolating our diagnostic and prevalence data to a
hypothetical acute hospital with 1,000 beds. Although we
acknowledge there are differing views, a timely diagnosis

1,000-bedded hospital and 10,000 non-elective admissions of older people yearly. We expect 1,700 (17%) would have delirium, with
60% of those also having dementia. Thirty-three per cent of that dementia will be unrecognised. We would expect 20% of patients to
have no informant available.

 of dementia during hospital admission may ameliorate
adverse events associated with a hospital stay [5], allow
signposting to a suitable cohort ward [30] or trigger the
need for comprehensive geriatric assessment [31]. It could
also lead to extra care in communication with patients, es-
pecially around issues of capacity assessment and consent-
ing for interventions.
Conclusions
Both the IQCODE-SF and AD8 are sensitive and specific
tools to detect dementia in older people presenting to hos-
pital with delirium. They are simple and quick to administer
as well as being freely available. Given the high prevalence of
delirium in older people in hospital, the routine use of either
tool in practice will have important clinical impact, potentially
improving the formal recognition of dementia as well as
having immediate implications for the inpatient care of this
vulnerable population.
Key points
• Delirium and dementia are common but undetected in
older hospital admissions.
• Delirium precludes traditional performance-based cogni-
tive assessment for dementia.
• Informant tools may offer a pragmatic solution to detect
dementia in older hospital patients with delirium.
• IQCODE-SF and AD8 are sensitive and specific tools to
detect dementia in patients with delirium.
