Background: Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) permits rapid evaluation of new therapeutic strategies
in cancer. However, RECIST does not capture the heterogeneity of response in highly active therapies. Depth of tumor response
may provide a more granular view of response. We explored the association between, depth of response (DepOR), with overall
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with NSCLC being treated with an ALK inhibitor (ALKi) or an anti-
PD-1 antibody (Ab).
Methods: Experimental arms from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of an ALKi and two RCTs of an anti-PD-1 Ab were
separately pooled. Patient responses were grouped into DepOR ‘quartiles’ by percentage of maximal tumor shrinkage
(Q1 ¼ 1%–25%, Q2 ¼ 26%–50%, Q3 ¼ 51%–75%, and Q4 ¼ 76%–100%), Q0 had no shrinkage. We carried out a retrospective
exploratory responder analysis to evaluate the association between DepOR and OS or PFS using hazard ratios (HR) generated by
the Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: In the pooled ALK analysis there were 12, 39, 70, 144, and 40 patients in quartiles 0–4, respectively. The DepOR versus
PFS/OS analyses HR were: 0.19/0.94 for Q1 0.11/0.56 for Q2, 0.05/0.28 for Q3, and 0.03/0.05 for Q4. In the PD-1 trials within
quartiles 0–4 there were 168, 70, 44, 45, and 28 patients, respectively. The DepOR versus PFS/OS analyses HR were 0.3/0.52 for
Q1, 0.22/0.47 for Q2, 0.09/0.07 for Q3, and 0.07/0.14 for Q4.
Conclusions: Our analysis suggests a greater DepOR is associated with longer PFS and OS for patients receiving ALKi or anti-
PD1 Ab. Overall, this suggests that DepOR may provide an additional outcome measure for clinical trials, and may allow better
comparisons of treatment activity.

Introduction
Oncology therapeutics development relies on assessment of several
clinical trial end points. Objective response rate (ORR), an often-
used end point, categorizes patients’ responses by Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) [1]. A limitation of
RECIST is that determination of response is a categorical output
that defines tumor responses to therapy as progression (�20%
growth), stable disease (19% growth to 29% reduction) versus par-
tial response (�30%) or complete response (100%) and thus does
not capture the full spectrum of benefit that patients derive from
therapy. Targeted therapies (TT) directed toward non-small-cell

 lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors harboring EGFR, ALK, or ROS1 gen-
etic alterations typically demonstrate ORR of 60%–80% or higher
in the front-line treatment setting [2–5]. Given the difficulty of im-
proving on these high response rates, the rapid development of TT,
and the challenge of monitoring treatment response with immu-
notherapies (IO), it is important to consider additional outcome
measures to characterize the anti-tumor activity of new drugs
more thoroughly and efficiently.
Depth of response (DepOR) is an outcome measure that has
been used in hematologic malignancies to evaluate changes in
M-protein in multiple myeloma, minimal residual disease in leu-
kemia and myeloma, as well as radiographic changes in colon
cancer [6–12]. For solid tumors, it is defined as the percent of
maximal tumor reduction from baseline of a target lesion. The
potential benefit of utilizing DepOR as an outcome measure is
that it is a more granular measure of tumor response than ORR
and might provide an earlier readout of drug activity than time-
to-event end points such as progression-free survival (PFS) or
overall survival (OS). In an era of more successful therapeutic
strategies, direct measure of tumor response might allow a better
determination of log cancer cell killing. It may also provide an
earlier assessment of activity for new combination therapeutic
approaches to treating cancer, a theme that has been often pro-
posed and studied in preclinical models but has not yet translated
into an end point to analyze in lung cancer clinical trials [13].
Recent analyses of NSCLC data from trials of TT have demon-
strated an association in clinical trial-level analyses between PFS
and ORR [14]. The question remains whether the individual pa-
tients who have the largest reduction in tumor burden, DepOR,
are the patients deriving benefit with longer OS or PFS. In this
study, we sought to determine whether there were patient-level
associations between the maximum reduction in tumor target le-
sions (DepOR) from baseline and PFS or OS in metastatic
NSCLC for two different representative drug categories—an ana-
plastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor representing a TT and
a programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) inhibitor.
Methods
Trial selection criteria
Data from two randomized trials were pooled for each drug for explora-
tory analyses (four in total). Within the ALK inhibitor trials 305 of the
345 (88%) patients were included in the analysis and within the PD-1 tri-
als 355 of 427 (83%) were included. Given that across the trials patients
were treated with different chemotherapy agents, data only from the ex-
perimental arms of the four trials were used. Trials and drugs were chosen
based on the availability of randomized data submitted to FDA from
March 2013 to March 2016. An ALK inhibitor was chosen as representa-
tive of a TT and a PD-1 inhibitor was chosen as representative of an IO.
For the two ALK inhibitor trials, one trial enrolled treatment-naı
¨ve pa-
tients and the other enrolled patients who had progression after platinum-
doublet-based chemotherapy. For both trials, key eligibility criteria
included a histologic diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
positive for ALK rearrangements by central testing using a break-apart
fluorescence in situ hybridization assay. Patients must have been at least
18years of age, had measurable disease, and an Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0–2. Key eligibility for
the two PD-1 inhibitor trials included patients having IIIB or IV NSCLC
who had disease recurrence after one prior platinum-containing regimen.
Patients were at least 18years of age, had an ECOG PS of 0–1, and not
allowed to have autoimmune disease, symptomatic interstitial lung disease,
systemic immunosuppression, or prior immune based therapies.
Outcome measures
Maximum tumor reduction from baseline was compared for PFS and
OS.
Statistical analysis
Data from patients with evaluable radiographic scans demonstrating any
reduction in tumor size were grouped into four quartiles based on the
greatest percent of reduction in tumor target lesions from baseline and
compared with data from patients with no tumor reduction. A retro-
spective exploratory responder analysis was carried out to evaluate the as-
sociation between the DepOR quartiles and PFS and OS for each drug
using hazard ratios (HR). Using both adjusted and unadjusted statistical
methods, HRs using the Cox HR model were computed. Kaplan–Meier
curves were plotted for PFS and OS by the DepOR quartiles. Only pa-
tients who had baseline and at least one post-baseline tumor measure-
ments were included in the analyses.
Results
Patient demographics
In the ALK-positive patient trials, the median age was 51years,
43% were men, most patients enrolled were white and not located
in the USA (Table 1). Most patients had ECOG PS of 0–1 (94%)
and were never smokers (63%). Patient demographics and disease
characteristics were balanced across the quartiles for most variables
with the exception that those patients with 76%–100% tumor re-
duction were more frequently females and never smokers.
Table 2 illustrates the PD-1 inhibitor patient characteristics.
The median age was 61 years, 62% were men and 90% of patients
were white. The majority (66%) were not from the USA, were
identified as current or former smokers (83%), and 66% had
non-squamous histology. All patients had an ECOG performance
status of 0–1. The demographic distribution across the quartiles
was largely stable apart from an increased number of patients in
Q4 with non-squamous histology (79%) and more patients in Q4
who were enrolled in the USA (50%).
ALK inhibitor pooled analysis
Figure 1A demonstrates the pooled maximal tumor reduction
from the two anonymized ALK inhibitor trials. Patients with any
amount of tumor size reduction (>0% to 100%) were grouped
into DepOR quartiles by the greatest percent decrease from base-
line in tumor target lesions. The analysis included 305 patients.
Twelve patients (3.9%) had no tumor size reduction; this group
serves as the comparator cohort. The distribution of patients
within each DepOR quartile was as follows: quartile 1 (1%–25%,
n ¼ 39), quartile 2 (26%–50%, n ¼ 70), quartile 3 (51%–75%,
n ¼ 144), and quartile 4 (76%–100%, n ¼ 40). Kaplan–Meier
curves for each of the DepOR quartiles demonstrate PFS (Figure
1B) and OS (Figure 1C) within each patient group. Table 3 lists
the unadjusted and adjusted HR using the Cox proportional haz-
ards model for the responder analysis. Within the ALK inhibitor
pooled trial analysis, increasing DepOR demonstrated a stepped

 improvement in OS; however, only DepOR quartiles 3 and 4
indicated nominally significant results with adjusted HR 0.28 (CI
0.11, 0.73) and HR 0.05 (CI 0.01, 0.28), respectively. The PFS ana-
lysis for the ALK inhibitor treated pooled group parallels the OS
finding with the exception that (Figure 1C) all DepOR quartiles
indicated significant association between DepOR and PFS.
Three-dimensional plots further illustrate the relationship be-
tween DepOR, patient quartile, and days on therapy (Figure 1D).
PD-1 inhibitor pooled analysis
We also analyzed two pooled, anonymized trials of patients treated
with a PD-1 inhibitor. Figure 2A illustrates the results as a waterfall
plot. Within DepOR quartiles 1–4 there were 70, 44, 45, and 28 pa-
tients, respectively. Of the 355 patients in the pooled analysis, 168
(47%) demonstrated no tumor size reduction. These results do not
demonstrate a stepped interval increase in OS or PFS as seen in the
ALK trials. Figure 2B and Table 3 illustrate the relationship be-
tween OS and DepOR quartile. In the adjusted analysis, all DepOR
quartiles
had
an
association
between
OS
and
DepOR.
Additionally, Q1/Q2 and Q3/Q4 had similar survival curves,
indicating that patients with >50% reduction in tumor burden
make-up one response group and those patients with �50% reduc-
tion in tumor burden comprise an alternate response group. When
PFS is evaluated in this group, a similar pattern is found (Figure
2C). Three-dimensional plots illustrate the association between
DepOR, patient, patient quartile, and days on therapy (Figure 2D).
Discussion
In this study, we evaluated the relationship between the DepOR
and OS or PFS in metastatic NSCLC patients treated either with a
TT or an IO. The results indicate that in metastatic NSCLC,
DepOR is associated with OS and PFS with a TT in a molecularly-
selected patient population and with a more complex relation-
ship in IO trials.
In the analyses of trials using ALK inhibitors, 96% of patients
had some degree of response/reduction in tumor size and there
was an incremental increase in survival across quartiles, although
in evaluation of OS, only patients in quartiles 3 and 4 had a sig-
nificantly longer survival time compared with patients with no

 tumor reduction. All quartiles had a significant association be-
tween DepOR and PFS. In the pooled ALK trials, post-study
treatments may have impacted overall survival, highlighting one
of the limitations of using OS as a clinical end point in cancers for
which multiple effective therapies are available. Finally, the refer-
ence group is limited by the small number of patients.
In the PD-1 inhibitor pooled analysis, 53% of patients had some
degree of tumor size reduction. Patients in all DepOR quartiles had
significantly longer PFS or OS compared with patients with no
tumor reduction. This finding may be due to the unique mechanism
of action of PD-1 inhibitors (indirect tumor cell inhibition) com-
pared with TKIs (direct tumor cell inhibition), and may indicate
that DepOR is not as clinically useful for IO therapies. Alternatively,
it could reflect that an arbitrary use of DepOR quartiles does not
represent the optimal cut-off. For example, Q3 and Q4 did not differ
from each other, but did seem to have greater benefit than Q1 and
Q2, suggesting that a 50% cut point may be a better threshold for
predicting benefit with IO therapies. Finally, a limitation of this ana-
lysis was the smaller number of patients in each of the four quartiles
compared with the non-responders. For example, only 21% of pa-
tients in the IO trials had �50% reduction in tumor size compared
with 60% of patients in the ALK inhibitor trials.
DepOR has been previously reported as an outcome measure
in solid tumors. It was investigated in colon cancer in a post hoc
analysis of the CRYSTAL and OPUS trials, which evaluated the
efficacy of FOLFIRIþ/� cetuximab and FOLFOX4þ/� cetuxi-
mab in 1535 patients and demonstrated that deeper responses
correlated with longer OS and post-progression survival [10]. It
was then evaluated prospectively in the phase III TRIBE
trial
in
which
first
line
FOLFOXIRI þ bevacizumab
and
FOLFIRI þ bevacizumab were compared in metastatic colorectal
cancer. The authors found that DepOR is highly correlated with
PFS, OS, and post-progression survival on a patient level [7].
DepOR is also a clinically meaningful outcome in multiple hema-
tologic malignancies and major molecular response evaluation is
now a standard outcome measure [9, 11, 12, 15, 16].
A search of Clinicaltrials.gov identified two active, therapeutic
trials that are evaluating DepOR as an outcome measure in pa-
tients with solid tumors. NCT02296125 is a trial of osimertinib
versus gefitinib or erlotinib in patients with locally advanced or
metastatic NSCLC and NCT02394834 is a study comparing treat-
ment sensitivity and prognostic factors in FOLFOX6 with either
bevacizumab or panitumumab in advanced or recurrent colorec-
tal cancer. These studies may assist in demonstrating the utility of
DepOR with additional TT and antibody therapies as well as with
additional tumor types.
The association between improved time to event outcomes in
patients with larger magnitude of DepOR suggests that for pa-
tients to obtain the most benefit from a treatment, maximizing
tumor size reduction is critical. Given the high ORR and ex-
tended PFS generated by TT such as ALK, ROS1, and EGFR TKIs,
using DepOR may provide an earlier read-out of activity for new
therapeutics. There are many strategies to maximize initial tumor
response, including the use of more potent TT in the first-line set-
ting [17], local therapy such as radiation or surgery to residual
disease at maximal response from initial therapy [18], or combin-
ation therapy strategies in the first-line setting [19, 20]. Most
therapeutic strategies have focused on any response, followed by
intervention to address drug resistance after disease progression
has occurred. The use of DepOR refocuses attention on the lack
of complete response in the vast majority of patients and may
allow for initial therapeutic strategies to improve responses and
possibly address primary resistance [13].
A limitation of this study was the inclusion of only one type of
TT. Thus, it is unclear whether our findings translate to other treat-
ment strategies. However, given its potential utility with chemo-
therapy in colon cancer, DepOR may have broader applicability.
We were unable to evaluate DepOR in the control arms of these tri-
als because patients received different chemotherapy regimens. In
this analysis, we only included target lesions as measurements of
non-target lesions were not collected. Given this we were unable to
make direct survival comparisons to the RECIST response catego-
ries. However, we expect that since our analysis is based on
RECIST data aggregated in DepOR quartiles the incremental im-
provement in survival in DepOR quartiles may not be observed in
RECIST categories. Additionally, we observed inter-patient vari-
ation which may be increased by using only measurable target le-
sions (Figures 1D and 2D). However, with a large sample size, this
variation may average out across a large patient population.
Finally, as RECIST is the current gold standard for evaluating re-
sponse the DepOR analysis, it is subject to the same limitations as
RECIST in that it is a marker of tumor burden.
Another limitation of this analysis is that the comparisons in
this responder analysis are carried out post-randomization and,

 therefore, potentially important prognostic values are not bal-
anced between quartiles. Additionally, the patient numbers
within each DepOR quartile differ, and in the IO trials, the num-
ber of patients with any tumor reduction is relatively low, 187
(53%). Furthermore, the use of DepOR quartiles was arbitrary
and may not represent the optimal cut-points for categorization
of a continuous variable. Finally, in patients with tumor growth
we did not evaluate the survival. Survival in patients without
tumor shrinkage likely reflects tumor biology and subsequent
therapy instead of treatment efficacy.
Prospective evaluations are needed to understand how to use
DepoR as an end point in clinical trials and how it compares with
traditional RECIST measures of tumor response. Additional evalu-
ations such as maximal tumor reduction at first imaging, or time
to maximal tumor reduction may be complementary. In conclu-
sion, DepOR may be a useful clinical end point to more efficiently
evaluate activity of new drugs or assist in the early evaluation of
new combination therapies to determine if there is the potential
for increased benefit over existing single agent therapies.
