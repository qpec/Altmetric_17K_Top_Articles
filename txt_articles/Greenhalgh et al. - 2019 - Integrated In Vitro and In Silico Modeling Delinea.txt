In Brief
The use of specific diets that promote the
growth of beneficial microorganisms
together with such microorganisms may
help treat such diseases as colorectal
cancer. Greenhalgh et al. show that one
such synbiotic regimen induces
downregulation of pro-carcinogenic and
drug resistance genes as well as
metabolic changes that affect the growth
of cancer cells.

SUMMARY
By modulating the human gut microbiome, prebiotics
and probiotics (combinations of which are called
synbiotics) may be used to treat diseases such as
colorectal cancer (CRC). Methodological limitations
have prevented determining the potential combina-
torial mechanisms of action of such regimens.
We expanded our HuMiX gut-on-a-chip model to
co-culture CRC-derived epithelial cells with a model
probiotic under a simulated prebiotic regimen, and
we integrated the multi-omic results with in silico
metabolic modeling. In contrast to individual prebi-
otic or probiotic treatments, the synbiotic regimen
caused downregulation of genes involved in procarci-
nogenic pathways and drug resistance, and reduced
levels of the oncometabolite lactate. Distinct ratios of
organic and short-chain fatty acids were produced
during the simulated regimens. Treatment of primary
CRC-derived cells with a molecular cocktail reflecting
the synbiotic regimen attenuated self-renewal ca-
pacity. Our integrated approach demonstrates the
potential of modeling for rationally formulating synbi-
otics-based treatments in the future.
INTRODUCTION
The human gut microbiome is increasingly recognized as playing
a major role in human health and disease (Pflughoeft and Versa-
lovic, 2012). Modulation of the gut microbiome using prebiotics
(non-digestible nutrients, e.g., dietary fiber, that promote the
growth of beneficial microorganisms in the host [Hutkins et al.,
2016]), probiotics (live microorganisms that, when administered
in adequate amounts, confer health benefits to the host [FAO and
WHO, 2002]), or combinations thereof (synbiotics) is regarded as
a means to prevent microbiome-linked diseases, such as colo-
rectal cancer (CRC) (Rafter et al., 2007; Raman et al., 2013). In
addition, such dietary regimens may act as supportive therapeu-
tic options in the management of diseases (DiMarco-Crook and
Xiao, 2015; Ho et al., 2018). However, although microbiome-
modulating therapeutics hold great promise (Valencia et al.,
2017), dietary regimens are not formally integrated in current
treatment plans (Caccialanza et al., 2016).
The health benefits attributed to dietary fiber and prebiotics in
the prevention of CRC (Murphy et al., 2012; Raman et al., 2013)
are mainly attributed to the metabolic activity of the gut micro-
biome resulting in specific fermentation products, such as
lactate and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and not to the fiber
itself (Koh et al., 2016; Sharma and Shukla, 2016). Thereby, com-
mon dietary guidance for CRC patients is to consume a diet rich
in fiber (Song et al., 2018). However, due to the limitations
of existing methodologies, in particular the lack of means to
study the molecular effects of diet-microbiome-host interactions
(Read and Holmes, 2017), limited evidence exists on the thera-
peutic benefits of pre- and probiotics in CRC treatment. A limited
number of studies have focused on inflammatory and prolifera-
tive signatures in CRC cells, but these have not assessed the
linked changes in gene expression or metabolism (Ho et al.,
2018; Le Leu et al., 2005). Nevertheless, the results from these
initial studies indicate the need for investigating the combinato-
rial effects of synbiotics at the molecular level as they may be
harnessed for therapeutic approaches in conjunction with other
CRC treatments. In this context, elucidating the mechanisms of
action of synbiotic regimens in relation to their possible influence
on chemotherapy resistance (Ho et al., 2018; Niero et al., 2014)
may prove particularly valuable to improve the efficacy of current
anti-cancer treatments.
Due to the fact that CRC is mostly driven by environmental fac-
tors (e.g., diet) (Blot and Tarone, 2015; Rothenberg, 2015) and a
broad range of mutations (Armaghany et al., 2012), it is chal-
lenging to recapitulate the complexity of the disease using only
one specific model (Young et al., 2013). Differences in diet, gut
topology, genetic background, and microbiome composition,
as well as the immune system, render widely used murine models
questionable for investigating mechanisms underlying human
host-microbiome interactions (Fritz et al., 2013; Hildebrand

 et al., 2013). Although a major limitation of in vitro models is their
reduced complexity, such models allow recapitulation of human
host-microbiome interactions and thereby allow the probing of
molecular exchanges between microbial and human cells and
their repercussions in a representative manner (Bein et al.,
2018; Paul et al., 2018). However, to study the complex and
dynamic processes driving diet-host-microbiome interactions
and their effects on CRC progression, in vitro models that allow
the investigation of molecular interactions between the specific
contingents are required. Moreover, when these models are
complemented using in silico modeling, we can study specific
individual metabolic reactions (e.g., via reaction fluxes), thereby
linking functional potential (in silico) to experimental measure-
ments (in vitro) (Magnu
´ sdo
´ ttir and Thiele, 2018).
Here, we used our representative microfluidics-based human-
microbial co-culture system called HuMiX (Shah et al., 2016) to
obtain essential mechanistic insights into the interplay between
a simulated high-fiber (HF) diet, the model probiotic Lactoba-
cillus rhamnosus Gorbach-Goldin (LGG), and human CRC cells.
We combined in vitro multi-omic data (transcriptomics and
metabolomics) with in silico simulations by using an integrated
constraint-based model (CBM) (Orth et al., 2010) of colon adeno-
carcinoma (COAD) cells coupled to a curated genome-scale
metabolic reconstruction of LGG (Magnu
´ sdo
´ ttir et al., 2017). In
contrast to individual prebiotic or probiotic treatments, the syn-
biotic regimen caused downregulation of genes involved in pro-
carcinogenic pathways and drug resistance, resulting in reduced
levels of the oncometabolite lactate. In vitro, different ratios of
organic and short-chain fatty acids were produced by the probi-
otic during the simulated regimens. We validated our results by
testing distinct cocktails of these metabolites reflecting the
different combinations on spheroid cultures generated from pri-
mary colon tumors. The treatment with a cocktail reflecting the
synbiotic regimen attenuated self-renewal capacity in primary
CRC-derived cells, a cellular hallmark of tumor progression
and disease dissemination. Taken together, our results provide
mechanistic support regarding the potential of integrating synbi-
otic combinations in the context of therapeutic regimens for
CRC (DiMarco-Crook and Xiao, 2015; Le Leu et al., 2005). We
anticipate that, in the near future, such integrative in vitro and
in silico modeling could be used to develop personalized dietary
treatments, including dietary guidelines and probiotic supple-
mentation for CRC patients.
RESULTS
Establishment of an In Vitro and In Silico Model System
to Study the Interactions between Dietary Fiber,
Probiotics, and the Human Host
In accordance with previous reports (Niero et al., 2014), we found
that a simulated dietary fiber regimen (e.g., prebiotic regimen) is
incompatible with standard cell culture approaches (Figure S1).
In contrast, the use of the HuMiX model allows the exposure of
human cells to dietary compounds and live bacterial cells via
the apical interface, thereby mimicking in vivo physiology and
enabling the study of diet-host-microbe molecular interactions
(Figure 1A). To simulate a fiber-rich prebiotic regimen, we
formulated a HF medium containing major non-digestible
carbohydrates and supplemented it with additional prebiotics
including arabinogalactan, xylan, and soy (Gibson et al., 1988)
(Figure 1B). A human cell culture medium providing the basic
requirements for culture of both Caco-2 cells and LGG (Shah
et al., 2016) was used as reference (REF) medium, i.e., a medium
containing no dietary fiber. Using the different simulated dietary
regimes (HF alone or REF alone), we studied the molecular
impact of diet on bacterial and human cell physiology (measured
by transcriptomics) as well as on the resulting intercellular cross-
talk (metabolomics).

chamber separated via a nanoporous membrane from the middle chamber that houses human epithelial cells (e.g., Caco-2 cells). The bottom chamber, also
separated from the middle chamber via a microporous membrane, is perfused with cell culture medium and mediates the transport of nutrients to the human cells’
basal surface. Using a transwell system setup, no growth of human cells in the presence of dietary fiber compounds could be observed. See also Figure S1.
In contrast, Caco-2 cells were viable when using the HuMiX model (Figure S2).

reference (REF) regimen contained neither dietary fiber (or prebiotics) nor starch. Both dietary regimens contained approximately the same amount of protein and
vitamins/minerals.

Cell Reports 27, 1621–1632, April 30, 2019
 To complement the in vitro modeling, we coupled a CBM
(Orth et al., 2010) of COAD cells with a model of LGG (Magnu
´ s-
do
´ ttir et al., 2017) A context-specific model of COAD was
reconstructed, starting with the genome-scale human meta-
bolic reconstruction Recon2 (Thiele et al., 2013) and data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset (Rahman
et al., 2015), as well as an extension to the FASTCORMICS
workflow (Pacheco et al., 2015) that uses RNA-seq data
(M.P.P., T.B., D. Ternes, D. Kulms, S.G., E.L., T.S., unpublished
data) (Figure 1C). The models were further contextualized with
in vitro data by using growth rates and secretion product ratios
generated in this study. For each dietary regimen (HF alone,
REF alone, HF + LGG, REF + LGG), we determined the differen-
tial flux span of each cell-type (Caco-2 and LGG), which were
grouped and summarized by assigned reaction subsystems
retrieved from the Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH) database
(Noronha et al., 2019).
A Simulated HF Regimen Alone Affects Energy
Metabolism in Caco-2 Cells
Recent studies have linked altered metabolism, through the pro-
duction of oncometabolites, to tumorigenesis in CRC (Corrado
et al., 2016; Morin et al., 2014). Analysis of the in silico differential
flux spans in HF-exposed Caco-2 cells in comparison to REF-
exposed cells revealed that the flux spans of 11 subsystem reac-
tions were smaller in the COAD model when exposed to the
simulated HF regimen versus the REF medium, including trans-
port, pentose phosphate metabolism, glycolysis, and gluconeo-
genesis, as well as fatty acid oxidation and synthesis (Figure 2A).
No COAD model reaction in Caco-2 had larger flux spans when
comparing predictions from the simulated HF regimen with the
REF medium (Figure 2A). Next, we analyzed whether alterations
in energy metabolism affected gene regulation. Indeed, expres-
sion of several glycolytic enzymes was found to be significantly
reduced in Caco-2 cells after co-culture with the simulated
HF regimen (Figure 2B), including phosphofructokinase (pfk),
aldolase B (aldob), fructo-1,6-biphosphatase (fbp1) and pyru-
vate kinase isozymes R and L (pklr) (Figure 2B). The snail family
transcriptional repressor 1 (snai1), which regulates glycolysis by
inhibiting pfk expression (Kim et al., 2017), was significantly
increased (Figure 2B). Increased glucose, lactate, and glutamine
levels promote metabolic reprogramming (Altman et al., 2016;
Jang et al., 2013), and, thus, we next investigated intracellular
concentrations in Caco-2 cells. In vitro, the intracellular lactate
concentrations in Caco-2 cells were significantly reduced (p =
2.63 3 10�3) in the presence of the simulated HF regimen
compared with the REF condition (Figure S2A and Table S1).
Furthermore, a downregulation (although not significant) of
lactate transporters was observed in Caco-2 cells exposed to
the simulated HF regimen compared with the REF medium (Fig-
ure S2B). Additionally, the concentration of intracellular glucose
was decreased (although not significant), while the concentra-
tion of glutamine was significantly increased (p = 2.43 3 10�3)

A Simulated HF Regimen Alone Activates Several
Oncogenes and Pro-inflammatory Pathways in Caco-2
Cells
Next, we evaluated the effect of the simulated HF regimen on
Caco-2 cell proliferation and viability. Although growth and
viability of Caco-2 cells in HuMiX were comparable between
the simulated dietary regimens (Figures S2D and S2E), the regi-
mens had a pronounced effect on the global transcriptome pro-
file of Caco-2 cells (Figure 3A). To place the transcriptome data
into biological context and reveal CRC signatures in human cells,
we performed a pathway analysis. When exposed to the simu-
lated HF regimen, the most enriched pathways were among
others responsible for regulating inflammatory responses in
CRC (Figure 3B; Table S2), e.g., IL-1 signaling (Voronov and
Apte, 2015; Wang and Dubois, 2010).
The network objects identified from the pathway analysis
included the IL-1 receptor 1 (il-1r1), as well as its downstream
targets, TNF receptor-associated factor (traf6), cyclooxyge-
nase-2 (cox-2), and c-jun (Figure 3C). The wingless integrated
(WNT) pathway included such network objects as ligand wnt5a
as well as downstream targets, such as snai1 and Frizzled-4
(fzd4), which were upregulated only when Caco-2 cells were
exposed to the simulated HF regimen (Figure 3C; Table S2).
Wnt signaling and its downstream targets are known to be
involved in CRC progression and drug resistance (Chikazawa
et al., 2010; Guo et al., 2016; Voronov and Apte, 2015; Zhan
et al., 2017) and are moderated in part by dietary agents
(Tarapore et al., 2012).
A Simulated HF Regimen Affects Gene Expression and
Metabolism of a Probiotic
We evaluated the effect of the simulated HF regimen on LGG
growth and viability. Although LGG viability was not significantly
affected by the presence of HF or REF medium (Figure S2F),
LGG growth was significantly reduced in the presence of the
simulated HF regimen than with REF (Figure S2G). The simulated
dietary regimen had a marked effect on the global transcriptome
profile of LGG (Figure 4A), similar to what we observed for the
human cells; we observed 355 differentially expressed genes
in LGG, including 47 upregulated hypothetical proteins, when
exposed to the simulated HF regimen versus the REF medium.

 Genes encoding the cellobiose transporter were upregulated in
LGG in the presence of the simulated HF regimen, suggesting
the catabolism of prebiotic components by LGG. Indeed, catab-
olism of prebiotic components used in our simulated HF medium
(e.g., arabinogalactan, xylan) has previously been suggested for
Lactobacillus species (Douillard et al., 2013; Jaskari et al., 1998).
These prior observations were supported by our own metabolo-
mic analyses of organic and short-chain fatty acids in the
supernatant (spent medium) when LGG is provided with different
dietary substrates. For instance, when LGG is provided with sim-
ple sugars (REF medium), mainly lactate and smaller amounts of
acetate and formate are produced (22.6 mM, 0.76 mM, and
0.52 mM respectively). In stark contrast, less lactate (3.22 mM)
but significantly higher levels of acetate (5.15 mM) and formate
(4.12 mM) were observed when LGG was grown in the simulated
HF medium (Figure 4B; Table S3). In silico, 13 subsystems had
reactions with decreased flux spans in the LGG metabolic model
under the simulated HF regimen compared with the REF me-
dium, including the TCA cycle, amino acid and energy meta-
bolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and starch and sucrose
metabolism, as well as fatty acid oxidation and synthesis (Fig-
ure 4C). Four additional subsystem reactions had larger flux
spans in LGG under the simulated HF regimen, including the
subsystems of transport, arginine and proline metabolism, and
the urea cycle (Figure 4C). This indicates that dietary substrates
are differentially metabolised by the probiotic LGG and it pro-
duces highly diet-dependent combinations of organic acids
(e.g., formate and lactate) and SCFAs (e.g., acetate).
Competition and Metabolic Cross-Feeding between the
Probiotic and Caco-2 Cells
We further investigated how the different dietary regimens
affected the metabolism of the human cells and the probiotic
by analyzing the intracellular metabolites of both cell contingents
following co-culture in the HuMiX model (Figure 5A; Tables S1,
S4, and S5). Although the intracellular concentrations of amino
acids such as leucine and glutamine were higher in Caco-2 cells
when grown in the presence of the simulated HF regimen in

 comparison to cells grown in the presence of REF medium, the
relative intracellular abundance of these amino acids in Caco-2
cells when co-cultured with the probiotic were significantly
lower, regardless of the simulated diet used (Figure 5A; Tables
S1 and S5). In silico, the flux spans through internal exchange
reactions, which reflect nutrient exchange between Caco-2 cells
and LGG, showed that both types of cells used these amino
acids from the simulated dietary regimens provided, suggesting
competition for these nutrients (Figure 5B). In vitro measure-
ments showed that relative intracellular concentrations of
leucine and glutamine were higher in LGG when compared to
Caco-2 cells (Figure 5A; Tables S1, S4, and S5). This indicates
that the probiotic outcompetes the host for these amino acids.
Similarly, the intracellular glucose concentrations in Caco-2
cells, which were highest when the cells were exposed to the
REF medium alone, were significantly lower when Caco-2 cells
were grown in the presence of the REF medium and LGG. This
finding suggests that LGG was consuming the glucose, and
therefore less glucose was available for the Caco-2 cells (Fig-
ure 5A). By contrast, intracellular lactate concentrations were
the highest in Caco-2 cells when exposed to the probiotic
LGG, regardless of the simulated diet used (Figure 5A; Table
S5). This finding suggests potential metabolic cross-feeding of
lactate produced by the probiotic LGG. In silico, metabolic
cross-feeding was observed between Caco-2 and LGG. Ace-
tate, succinate, lactate, and alanine were secreted by LGG and
consumed by Caco-2 cells only when co-cultured with LGG ac-
cording to the enlarged flux spans associated with the corre-
sponding exchange reactions (Figure 5B). While overall transport
reactions in Caco-2 cells and LGG had larger flux spans when
provided with the simulated HF regimen, fluxes through fatty
acid synthesis and oxidation, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,
and the urea cycle (among other pathways) were decreased in
Caco-2 cells (Figure 5C). Taken together, our in vitro metabolite
profiles and in silico simulations highlight metabolic cross-
feeding as well as competition for resources between the probi-
otic LGG and Caco-2 cells.
To better understand which genes or pathways in LGG (when
exposed to the simulated HF regimen) were responsible for the
observed changes in gene expression in Caco-2 cells, we linked
the Caco-2 in silico predicted differential fluxes to the LGG differ-
ential gene expression data and observed that the functions of
21 genes in LGG were associated with 34 reactions in the
Caco-2 cells (Table S7), indicating diet-dependent effects of
LGG metabolism on Caco-2 cell metabolism.
The Synbiotic Regimen Decreases Expression of
Pro-carcinogenic Genes and ABC-Transporters in
Human Cells
Next, we analyzed how growth in the presence of the LGG pro-
biotic altered gene expression in Caco-2 cells. Principal-compo-
nent analysis showed that the presence of LGG had an effect on
the global transcriptome profile of Caco-2 cells grown in the
simulated HF regimen but not when REF medium was used (Fig-
ure 3A). A total of 1,771 genes was differentially expressed in
Caco-2 cells grown in the simulated HF regimen in the presence
of LGG compared with the expression in the same dietary
regimen in the absence of LGG. Pathway enrichment analysis

 showed that apoptosis and survival granzyme A signaling, as
well as protein folding and maturation, were upregulated when
Caco-2 cells were exposed to HF + LGG (synbiotic; Figure 6A)
but downregulated when exposed to HF alone. Notably, a sub-
stantial number of CRC-associated pathways was downregu-
lated including the ‘‘colorectal cancer’’ pathway (as defined in
MetaCore), and G-protein K-RAS signaling (Figure 6A). Down-
stream targets of Kirsten rat sarcoma (K-RAS) signaling such
as phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic
subunit alpha (PI3K-CA) were also downregulated only in the
HF + LGG condition (Table S6).
In addition to the downregulated CRC-associated pathways,
the expression of several ABC transporters was significantly
decreased in Caco-2 cells after co-culture with the combination
of HF + LGG (Figure 6B). ABC transporters have been implicated
in drug resistance (Gottesman et al., 2002), and high abcc2
expression has also been associated with the early stages of
CRC progression (Andersen et al., 2015). A search of the differ-
entially expressed gene list of Caco-2 cells grown in the pres-
ence of HF + LGG against the DrugBank database revealed
that the downregulated genes abcc2, abcc3, cyp1a1, cox-2,
and cyp2d6 all encode targets of CRC drugs (Table S8). This
suggests that probiotics, dietary regimens, and combinations
thereof can affect major gene targets of CRC drugs.
The Combination of Organic and Short-Chain Fatty
Acids Produced by LGG Is Diet Dependent and Elicits
Differential Effects in CRC Cells
The observed changes in host gene expression could be due to
the diet-dependent metabolites secreted by LGG (Thomas and
Versalovic, 2010). As some of these pathways (e.g., PIK3-CA
and the mammalian target of rapamycin [mTOR] signaling
pathway) are related to cell self-renewal capacity (Xia and Xu,
2015), we stimulated Caco-2 cells and a primary CRC cell line
(T-6) with the fermentation products produced by LGG in the
presence of the simulated HF or REF medium. The CRC
spheroid cultures were first separately exposed to 10 mM of
the individual metabolites (which is between 2.5 and 12.5 times
higher than the concentrations of the SCFAs produced by
LGG). Under these conditions, the self-renewal capacity signif-
icantly increased in both Caco-2 and T-6 cells compared with
the untreated controls (Figure 7A). However, when the cells
were treated with the respective ratios of metabolites produced
by LGG when exposed to the two dietary regimens (Figure 4B),
we observed that only the cocktail of molecules reflecting the
synbiotic attenuated cancer cell self-renewal capacity (Figures
4B and 7A). Thereby, the distinct, diet-dependent ratios of
organic and short-chain fatty acids produced by the probiotic
produced during the synbiotic regimen were able to revert

DISCUSSION
CRC is a multifactorial disease, and different cellular pathways
play a role at different stages. While the combined use of pre-
and probiotics may support the treatment of CRC (Ho et al.,
2018), limited research exists to explain the mechanisms of ac-
tion of such synbiotic regimens due to methodological limita-
tions. Therefore, we expanded our HuMiX gut-on-a-chip model
to co-culture CRC-derived epithelial cells with a model probiotic
under a simulated prebiotic HF regimen. By using our integrated
multi-omic approach in combination with in vitro and in silico
metabolic modeling, we were able to unravel the combinatorial
effects of the studied synbiotic regimen on CRC cells. Observed
effects included downregulation of CRC-associated signaling
pathways and drug-resistance genes, and enhanced metabolic
competition as well as the production of specific ratios of small
molecules which attenuated cancer cell self-renewal capacity.
Inflammatory responses have been linked to both the develop-
ment and progression of CRC (Rhodes and Campbell, 2002).
Exposure of CRC-derived cells to the simulated prebiotic
regimen (HF alone) led to an upregulation of signaling pathways
related to inflammation. Experimental and clinical studies indi-
cate that colonocyte homeostasis requires gut microbial fermen-
tation of dietary fiber. Oxidative stress and inflammation in the
colon can thereby be caused by dysbiotic luminal fermentation
and/or deficiencies in SCFAs (Harty, 2013; Singh et al., 2018).
In addition to deficiencies in SCFAs, specific components pre-
sent in the HF regimen (e.g., pectins), which in the absence of
LGG are not prone to microbial fermentation, are most likely
responsible for the pro-inflammatory effects observed in the
human cells (Singh et al., 2018). In contrast, when the CRC-
derived cells were treated with the synbiotic combination (HF +
LGG), inflammation-driven CRC-associated signaling pathways
as well as CRC-oncogenes expression were downregulated.
Thus, we speculate that the altered gut microbiome composition
arising due to harsh CRC treatments, together with the con-
sumption of dietary fiber may indeed promote CRC progression.
Apart from CRC-oncogenes, we observed that the synbiotic
formulation reduced the expression of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) transporter genes, which play roles in the resistance to
anti-cancer drugs (Gottesman et al., 2002). In fact, overexpres-
sion of these transporters is the most commonly observed
mechanism through which cancer cells become drug resistant
(Davis and Tew, 2017; Szaka
´ cs et al., 2006). Therefore, the tar-
geting of ABC transporter expression may be a promising
strategy to sensitize drug-resistant cancer cells (Gottesman
et al., 2002). In this context, gut microbiota have the po-
tential to interact with ABC transporters (Mercado-Lubo and
McCormick, 2010) and, thus, have been suggested as therapeu-
tic agents for CRC (Hlavata et al., 2012). Abca2, which was
downregulated in the CRC-derived cells only when exposed to
the synbiotic regimen, might be of particular interest because
the inhibition of ATP-binding cassette transporter-2 (ABCA2) de-
sensitizes resistant cancer cells (Davis and Tew, 2017). The
bacterial toxin cycle inhibiting factor (Cif) has been found to
selectively reduce abcc2 transporter expression and has been
shown to increase the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs
(Patyar et al., 2010; Ye et al., 2008). We did not identify a homo-
log of Cif in LGG, which suggests that other bacterial molecules
or components in the prebiotic medium elicit similar effects.
Taken together, our results demonstrate that only the synbi-
otic regimen downregulated the expression of genes conferring
drug-resistance. When dietary fiber was provided alone to CRC-
derived cells, we observed inflammatory signaling pathways
to be upregulated, which is in contrast to the beneficial
effects previously observed for dietary fiber consumption in
CRC prevention (Murphy et al., 2012). However, our results are
in line with a recent cohort study conducted by the European
Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC),
which found that increased intake of dietary fiber was not
associated with increased CRC-survival (Ward et al., 2016).
Therefore, synbiotics and/or produced molecules may prove
efficacious for decreasing CRC-progression by limiting resis-
tance to anti-cancer drugs in the future.
Because one of the drivers of cancer progression is metabolic
competition and cross-feeding in the tumor microenvironment
(Chang et al., 2015), it is of relevance to understand what dietary
components are utilized by probiotics such as LGG or other
commensals that may be located in vicinity of the tumor. Regard-
less of which dietary regimen was provided, the probiotic utilized
the same substrates as the host cells in vitro and in silico, high-
lighting competition over resources. Furthermore, the flux span
analysis of exchange reactions showed that several metabolites

 secreted by the probiotic, namely lactate, succinate, alanine,
and acetate, were only available to the CRC-derived cells
when co-cultured with the probiotic (metabolic cross-feeding).
Enteric bacteria interact extensively with the host through meta-
bolic substrate exchange (Nicholson et al., 2005). Pre- and
probiotics should therefore be selected such that the metabolic
end products of a synbiotic regimen may not promote cancer
cell growth. In this context, our results underpin the concept
of formulating synbiotic regimens that limit metabolic cross-
feeding and enhance competition between the gut microbiome
and host cells, thereby limiting the production of primary sub-
strates for CRC cell growth.
We further investigated whether the production of specific
molecules secreted by the probiotic under the different simu-
lated regimens may exhibit specific anti-cancer properties.
Lactobacilli are capable of hydrolyzing dietary fiber (Ga
¨ nzle
and Follador, 2012), but the resulting metabolic end products
so far remain elusive. Inconsistencies in human trials concerning
probiotic supplementation for CRC patient could be due to
highly individualized diet-probiotic combinations. Here, we
demonstrate that the probiotic LGG produces a distinct set of
metabolites according to available dietary substrates and,
consequently, the beneficial effects of probiotic supplementa-
tion largely depend on diet. For instance, the molecular cocktail
produced by LGG during the synbiotic regimen attenuated can-
cer cell self-renewal capacity. Self-renewal capacity is a proxy
for a cell’s ability to maintain an undifferentiated state and to
form colonies (Francipane and Lagasse, 2014; He et al., 2009).
This in turn depends on the function of cellular and molecular
pathway(s) essential for the growth and the maintenance of
self-renewal of cancer stem cells (e.g., the PIK3-CA and mTOR
signaling pathway) (Xia and Xu, 2015). It has not escaped our
attention that the downregulation of this pathway in the CRC-
derived cells might be due to the diet-dependent cocktail of
molecules produced by the probiotic.
Our results demonstrate the importance of including dietary
formulations, such as the synbiotic combination tested here,
into CRC treatment plans (Niero et al., 2014). Further studies,
including investigations of additional combinations of synbiot-
ics, are necessary to further explore the mechanisms through
which prebiotics and probiotics influence the molecular and
cellular hallmarks of CRC cells. Of particular interest will be
studies that use different synbiotic regimens as adjuvants,
i.e., in combination with anti-cancer drug treatments. In this
context, our findings may also be of interest for the treatment
of inflammatory diseases of the gut that may precede CRC,
such as inflammatory bowel disease. Additional studies
involving representative, complex gut microbiota will also be
required to understand the physiological repercussions of syn-
biotics in relation to the overall microbial context of the human
gut. Finally, personalized in vitro models comprising primary
CRC-derived cells and the microbiota from the same individual
will allow to delineate individual-specific responses to formu-
late personalized treatment regimens. The combination of
in vitro models, such as HuMiX, with in silico simulations will,
thus, prove indispensable to unravel the combinatorial effects
of synbiotics and drugs for improved anti-cancer treatments
in the future.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Human Cell Culture
The human epithelial CRC cell line Caco-2 (DSMZ: ACC169) were maintained in aerobic conditions at 37�C at 5% CO2 in DMEM high
glucose (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 20% FBS (ThermoFisher).
Primary cell culture
Primary CRC tumor colon tissue was collected from an adenoma stage III CRC male patient by the Integrated Biobank of
Luxembourg (IBBL, www.ibbl.lu) in accordance with institutional guidelines and has previously been described (Qureshi-Baig
et al., 2016). All human samples used in the scope of this work were donated freely and written informed consent was
obtained from the donor for the use of the sample for research. Ethical approval was obtained from the Comite
´ National
d’Ethique de Recherche, Luxembourg (Reference number 201009/09). Primary CRC cell T6 were maintained in aerobic condi-
tions at 37�C in 5% CO2 in DMEM-F12 (Westburg) supplemented with 10% FBS (ThermoFisher) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin
(P/S; Lonza).
Bacterial cell culture
Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) (ATCC: 53103) cultures were started from glycerol stocks kept at - 80�C and precultured over-
night in Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHIS; Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 1% hemin (Sigma-Aldrich) in hungate tubes (VWR) in an
anaerobic chamber (MBraun) at 37�C, 5% CO2 and < 0.1% O2.
METHOD DETAILS
The HuMiX model
The assembly and setup steps of the HuMiX model have been described previously (Shah et al., 2016). In short, on day 1 after the
HuMiX assembly, a 1 mL suspension of Caco-2 cells (6 3 105 cells/mL) in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 20% FBS
(ThermoFisher) were injected into the epithelial chamber using a sterile disposable syringe (BD Biosciences) into the discofix
3-way stopcock (B.Braun) attached to a marprene tubing (Watson-Marlow) attached to the HuMiX inlet of the middle microchamber
(Shah et al., 2016). After injection of Caco-2 cells on day 1, cells were allowed to attach to the collagen-coated (Invitrogen) micropo-
rous membrane (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37�C. 3 hours after the inoculation of cells, the peristaltic pump (Watson-Marlow) perfused DMEM
medium at a flow rate of 25 mL min�1 into the bacterial chamber and into the lower perfusion chamber. For 7 days, Caco-2 cells were
continuously perfused with fresh DMEM medium from both apical (anaerobic medium) and basal side (aerobic medium), until a
confluent Caco-2 monolayer was established (Shah et al., 2016). The anaerobic environment in HuMiX was maintained in the micro-
bial microchamber at 0.1% by continuously bubbling the medium with dinitrogen gas. On day 7, after 24 hours preculture of LGG in
BHIB (Sigma-Aldrich) in an anaerobic hungate tube (VWR), the bacterial cells were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 7 minutes, and washed
twice with PBS (Sigma-Aldrich). Then, 1 mL (OD �1) of anaerobic bacterial suspension in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with
20% FBS (ThermoFisher) was injected into the microbial microchamber onto the mucin-coated (Sigma-Aldrich) nanoporous
membrane (VWR) as described above for human cells and the flow of the peristaltic pump continued to 25 mL min�1, 30 minutes after
bacterial inoculation (Shah et al., 2016). If the bacteria were provided with the simulated HF medium, the microbial microchamber in
the HuMiX model was first primed for several hours with the HF medium, prior to the inoculation of bacteria. After a 24-hour co-culture
of Caco-2 cells and LGG and the dietary regimen, the HuMiX experiment was terminated, the device was disassembled, and bacterial
and human cells were collected from the microchambers (Shah et al., 2016). Two types of analyses were performed for each
contingent whereby half of the biomass was used for biomolecular extraction, and a quarter was used for cell viability and count
assessment performed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences).

 Biomacromolecular extraction
The biomolecular extraction for both Caco-2 and LGG cells have been described previously (Roume et al., 2013) (Shah et al., 2016). In
short, Caco-2 cells were treated with a 1:1 methanol:water (v/v) solution (Merck), and polar and non-polar metabolite fractions were
separated using chloroform (Merck). These fractions (containing intracellular metabolites) were snap-frozen and stored at - 80�C until
use. The interphase containing DNA, RNA, and protein, were then processed using AllPrep DNA/RNA/Protein Kit (QIAGEN). The
microbial cells were transferred to Precellys plastic vials containing 600 mg of 0.15-0.2 mm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich), followed
by lysis using Precelly’s Homogenizer (Bertin Instruments). After cell lysis, polar and non-polar bacterial metabolite fractions were
obtained by treatment with cold 1:3 methanol:water solution (v/v) (Merck). The bacterial interphase, including the glass beads
(Sigma-Aldrich), were snap-frozen or processed directly using an All-in-One purification kit (Norgen). After extraction, biomolecules
were stored at - 80�C until analysis.
Intracellular metabolite extraction
300 mL of the upper polar phase was transferred in technical duplicates into Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) glass
vials (Chromatographie Zubeho
¨ r Trott) and dried overnight at - 4�C in a CentriVap (Labconco). 150 mL of the lower non-polar phase
was transferred in technical duplicates into GC/MS glass vials (Chromatographie Zubeho
¨ r Trott) and dried overnight under a chem-
ical hood. All GC/MS glass vials were capped and stored at �80�C until analyses. The remainder of the polar and non-polar phases
was aliquoted in eppendorf tubes and stored at �80�C. 5-10 mL of the remainder of each sample was used for the quality control (QC)
(pooling mixture) during GC/MS analysis.
Metabolite derivatization was performed using a multi-purpose sampler (GERSTEL). Dried polar sample extracts were dissolved
in 20 mL pyridine, containing 20 mg/mL of methoxyamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated under shaking for 120 min at
45�C. After adding 20 mL N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyl-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Macherey-Nagel), samples were incubated for
additional 30 min at 45�C under continuous shaking.
GC-MS analysis was performed by using an Agilent 7890B GC – 5977A MS instrument (Agilent Technologies). A sample volume of
1 mL was injected into a Split/Splitless inlet, operating in split mode (3:1) at 270�C. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a 5 m
guard column + 30 m (I.D. 250 mm, film 0.25 mm) DB-35MS capillary column (Agilent J&W GC Column). Helium was used as carrier gas
with a constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min.
The GC oven temperature was held at 90�C for 1 min and increased to 270�C at 9�C/min. Then, the temperature was increased
to 320�C at 25�C/min and held for 7 min. The total run time was 30 min. The transfer line temperature was set constantly to
280�C. The mass selective detector (MSD) was operating under electron ionization at 70 eV. The MS source was held at 230�C
and the quadrupole at 150�C. Full scan mass spectra were acquired from m/z 70 to 700.
We applied an untargeted metabolic profiling approach in which the detected sample analytes were matched against an in-house
library comprised of metabolites of the central carbon metabolism, as well as amino acid degradation/biosynthesis and or other
related metabolites. Unidentified/undetected analytes are listed as ‘‘no match‘‘. All GC-MS chromatograms were processed using
the MetaboliteDetector software, v3.020151231Ra (Hiller et al., 2009). The software package supports automatic deconvolution of all
mass spectra, peak picking, integration, and retention index calibration. The following deconvolution settings were applied: Peak
threshold: 5; Minimum peak height: 5; Bins per scan: 10; Deconvolution width: 5 scans; No baseline adjustment; Minimum 15 peaks
per spectrum; No minimum required base peak intensity. Compounds were annotated by retention index and mass spectrum using
the in-house mass spectral library.
Cell viability and counting
The mucin-coated bacterial membrane was first gently washed with PBS (Sigma-Aldrich) and resuspended in MACS buffer (PBS
containing 1% BSA), then stained with the Live-dead Bac Light bacterial viability Kit (Life Technologies), followed by fixation with
3.7% Formaldehyde (Carl Roth). Quantification of bacterial cells was performed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) using approx-
imately a 1:100 dilution of bacterial suspension and 10 mL of bacteria counting beads (ThermoFisher) as a standard for the volume of
suspension. Caco-2 cells were stained with Live/Dead Fixable Near-IR Dead Cell Stain Kit (ThermoFisher) and fixed with 3.7% Form-
aldehyde (Carl Roth). The resulting data were analyzed using FlowJo software (BD Biosciences).
SCFAs extraction
The conditioned medium (cell-free supernatant containing soluble factors) was collected by centrifugation (4�C for 10 min at
12,000 x g) from 48-hour bacterial cultures in hungate tubes (VWR), aliquoted 5 3 750 mL into Eppendorf tubes, then snap-frozen
and stored at �80�C until analysis. The extraction protocol of the SCFAs is based on an established protocol (Moreau et al.,
2003). 20 mL of the internal standard (2-Ethylbutyric acid, c = 20 mmol/L, Sigma-Aldrich), were added to 180 mL of conditioned
medium. After acidification with 10 mL of 37% hydrochloric acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mL of diethyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich) was added
and the samples were vortexed for 15 min at room temperature (Eppendorf Thermomixer). The upper organic phase was separated
by centrifugation (5 min, 21,000 x g) and 900 mL were collected in a new reaction tube. A further 1 mL of diethyl ether (Sigma-Aldrich)
was then added to the conditioned medium, and the tube was incubated and its contents separated by centrifugation. Then, 900 mL
of the organic phase were combined with the first extract, and 250 mL of this combined mixture were transferred into a GC glass vial
with micro insert (5-250 mL), in triplicate. For derivatization, 25 mL of N-tert-Butyldimethylsilyl-Nmethyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA)

e5
 with 1% tert-Butyldimethylchlorosilane (TBDMSCI, Restek) was added, and the samples were incubated for a minimum of 1 h at
room temperature.
SCFAs measurement
GC-MS analysis was performed by using an Agilent 7890A GC – 5975C MS instrument (Agilent Technologies). A sample volume of
1 mL was injected into a Split/Splitless inlet, operating in split mode (20:1) at 270�C. The gas chromatograph was equipped with a 30 m
(I.D. 250 mm, film 0.25 mm) DB-5MS capillary column (Agilent J&W GC Column). Helium was used as carrier gas with a constant flow
rate of 1.4 mL/min.
The GC oven temperature was held at 80�C for 1 min and increased to 150�C at 10�C/min. Then, the temperature was increased
to 280�C at 50�C/min (post run time: 3 min). The total run time was 15 min. The transfer line temperature was set to 280�C. The mass
selective (MS) detector was operating under electron ionization at 70 eV. The MS source was held at 230�C and the quadrupole at
150�C. The detector was switched off during elution of MTBSTFA. For precise quantification, GC/MS measurements of the
compounds of interest were performed in selected ion monitoring mode.
All GC-MS chromatograms were processed as described above.
Lactate measurement
Lactate from the LGG conditioned medium in either simulated HF or REF medium, as described above, were measured using a YSI
Biochemistry Analyzer (YSI).
RNA library preparation for Caco-2 and LGG
Sequencing library preparation was performed using a NEBNext, Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NewEngland Biolabs) using
500 ng of total RNA isolated from LGG or Caco-2 cells cocultured inside HuMiX under the described media conditions. Briefly, for
bacterial RNA samples, ribosomal RNA depletion was carried out using a Ribo-Zero rRNA Removal Kit (bacteria) (Illumina) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Ribo-depleted RNA was purified using magnetic beads, resuspended into 5 mL of TE (Tris-EDTA)
buffer and further processed for library preparation according to chapter 3 of the NEBNext, Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit
(NewEngland Biolabs) protocol booklet. The sequencing libraries for the Caco-2 RNA samples were prepared according to the
protocol provided in chapter 2 of the NEBNext, Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (NewEngland Biolabs). The libraries were quan-
tified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (ThermoFisher), and quality was determined using the bioanalyzer (Agilent). Pooled libraries
were sequenced on a NextSeq500 sequencer using 2 3 75 cycle reaction chemistry. FASTQ file generation and demultiplexing were
performed using bcl2fastq (Illumina).
Simulated media preparation
Two types of simulated dietary regimens were used in our study. The high-fiber (HF) medium is a modification from the simulated ileal
environment medium (SIEM) (Gibson et al., 1988). SIEM medium contained 47 g/L bactopeptone (BD Biosciences), 78.4 g/L potato
starch (Sigma-Aldrich), 9.4 g/L xylan (Sigma-Aldrich), 9.4 g/L arabinogalactan (Sigma-Aldrich), 9.4 g/L amylopectin (Sigma-Aldrich),
9.4 g/L pectin (Sigma-Aldrich), 3 g/L casein hydrosylate (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.8 g/L dehydrated bile (Sigma-Aldrich), and 4 g/L soy
(Frutarom). All components were dissolved in distilled water with the help of a magnetic stirrer and heat (120�C). The medium was
autoclaved at 121�C, and 10 mL/L trace minerals (ATCC), 10 mL/L Vitamin mix (ATCC), menadione (Sigma-Aldrich) and 100 mM
cysteine HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) were filter-sterilized and added to the autoclaved medium. Menadione was dissolved (1 mg/mL) in
DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) prior to being added to the medium. After achieving complete homogeneity, the pH was adjusted to 7.0 using
HCl and NaOH (Sigma-Aldrich). The medium was conserved in 50 mL aliquots at - 20�C until use. Before use, the medium was
thawed at 37�C, transferred to a serum bottle with a rubber stopper (VWR), and made anoxic by 48 hour incubation in an anaerobic
chamber (M.Braun). The no-dietary-fiber medium, termed the reference (REF) medium, was Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 20% FBS (ThermoFisher), as it provides the basic requirements for culture of both
Caco-2 cells and LGG (Shah et al., 2016).
Sphere and 3D colony formation assays
Self-renewal capacity was assessed with sphere formation assays, as previously described (Qureshi-Baig et al., 2016). Briefly,
primary CRC cells T6 (IBBL) and Caco-2 cells were seeded at different densities (e.g., 1, 2, or 3 cells per well), and after 10 days
of culture, the resulting spheroids were counted and measured under a microscope. Extreme limiting dilution analysis (ELDA) soft-
ware (Hu and Smyth, 2009) was used to determine the self-renewal capacity after a given treatment. 3D colony formation was
assessed by resuspending the cells in a serum-free a mix of 60% Sphere Culture Medium (SCM) (Qureshi-Baig et al., 2016) and
40% methylcellulose medium, i.e., MethoCult � H4100 (STEMCELL Technologies) medium, supplemented with 20 ng/mL Epidermal
Growth Factor (EGF; Biomol) and 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF; Miltenyi Biotec). The SCM medium was composed
of DMEM-F12 (Westburg), 20 mL/mL of B27 (ThermoFisher), 2 mL/mL of insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 3.4 mL/mL of glucose (Sigma-Aldrich),
4 mg/mL of heparin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 10 mL/mL of 1% P/S (Lonza). 250 cells per well (per 35 mm dish) were seeded. The resulting
colonies were counted after 14 days, using an inverted microscope.

 qRT-PCR validation
cDNA synthesis was performed on Caco-2 RNA samples from HuMiX using the Superscript Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was
performed on abcc3, abca5, abcc2, cox-2, traf6, and c-Jun using SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and processed according to the
protocol booklet using HPRT1 and GAPDH as housekeeping genes. The primer sequences can be found in Table S9. Thermocycling
parameters were 95�C (5 min; denaturing step), followed by amplification 95�C (15 s), 60�C (40 s), and 72�C (30 s). A total of 50 cycles
were performed. Reactions were performed on LightCycler Instrument (Roche).
In silico model predictions
Simulations were performed in MATLAB version 2016b (MathWorks, Inc.) using the COBRA Toolbox 3.0, version 31.05.2018 (Heir-
endt et al., 2019) (https://opencobra.github.io/). Computationally efficient flux variability analysis (Gudmundsson and Thiele, 2010)
was performed with the IBM CPLEX (IBM, Inc.) solver. A context-specific COAD model was reconstructed using the human
genome-scale metabolic reconstruction Recon2 (Thiele et al., 2013) and data from the TCGA dataset, an adaptation of the
FASTCORMICS workflow for RNA-seq data (Vlassis et al., 2014). The uptake reactions of Recon2 were first constrained in relation
of the media composition. Then, FASTCC (Vlassis et al., 2014) was run to remove any inconsistent reactions. The medium-
constrained Recon 2 model and the expression data from COAD patients from the TCGA dataset were used as input for a modified
version of FASTCORMICS workflow (Pacheco et al., 2015) that allows processing of RNA-Seq datasets.
In silico diet-host-bacteria reconstruction
The COAD and LGG model were constructed using the createMultiSpeciesModel function in the Microbiome Modeling Toolbox
(Baldini et al., 2018) which was implemented in the COBRA Toolbox (Heirendt et al., 2019). Briefly, the two models were joined
through a shared compartment representing the intestinal lumen, which enabled cross-feeding and served as an inlet for the simu-
lated medium and an outlet for the secretion of metabolic end products. The fluxes through all metabolic and transport reactions in
each joined model were coupled to the flux through its biomass objective function (Heinken et al., 2013). The models were contex-
tualized as follows: (i) Growth rates calculated from cell counts measured in vitro were used as lower and upper bounds on the
respective species’ biomass objective functions in the conditions with experimental data available. If cell count measurements for
Caco-2 were not available, a growth rate of 0.01 h-1 was assumed. (ii) Semiquantitative measurements for acid production by
LGG in a single culture were integrated by enforcing the ratio between acetate and formate production to the measured ratios (iii).
The respective medium (HF or REF) was implemented as constraints on the exchange reactions to the lumen compartment, which
represents the apical side of HuMiX. In each simulation including the human cell, the DMEM medium was additionally implemented
as constraints on the body fluid exchange reactions, which represent the basal side of HuMiX. Uptake of O2 by COAD cells was
allowed by setting the lower bounds on the body fluid O2 exchange reaction to �100. To ensure anoxic conditions on the luminal
side, O2 uptake via the lumen compartment was prevented by setting the lower bound on the lumen O2 exchange reaction to
zero. The reference and simulated HF media were adapted as in silico constraints by translating the dietary components into the
corresponding Virtual Metabolic Human (https://vmh.life) metabolite identifiers and estimating the uptake rates based on the
in vitro composition (Noronha et al., 2019). Scripts used to perform simulations are provided in https://github.com/ThieleLab/
CodeBase/tree/master/Simulations_Greenhalgh_CellMetabolism_2019.
Drug target identification
For the drug target identification, a pipeline was established that automatically retrieved gene and drug interactions as well as their
relation to cancer (Adapted from (Pacheco et al., 2015)). The pipeline retrieves data from selected databases and was implemented in
MATLAB 2017b. As input, a list of Ensembl identifiers (or other) is sufficient. The pipeline converted the Ensembl identifiers into the
official gene symbol as well as UniProt identifier. A list of corresponding IDs can be retrieved from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee website (available at https://www.genenames.org/cgi-bin/download) and Biomart (provided by Ensembl, available at
http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/). The UniProt identifiers were then used to retrieve drug target information from the
DrugBank (Release Version 5.0.10 available at https://www.drugbank.ca/), a freely accessible database that contains information
on more than 10,510 drugs as well as their targets. The urlread command from MATLAB 2017b allowed to search for each UniProt
identifier (by combining the website URL with the UniProt identifier) in the DrugBank in order to read the source code and to extract
the names and BE identifiers using regular expression (regexpi command). The process was repeated using the BE identifiers to
retrieve protein-drug associations along with the drug name, the drug group (e.g., approved, experimental, nutraceutical, illicit,
withdrawn, and investigational), actions (e.g., inhibitor, substrate, activator, and inducer) and, most importantly, the drug identifiers.
The pipeline then retrieved, for each drug identifier (using the same approach), information on the drugs, such as drug categories and
KEGG drug identifiers for pathway extraction using regular expression on the source code. The KEGG identifiers (http://www.genome.
jp/dbget-bin/www_bget?drug:D02368) were used to retrieve human-related pathways. In the last step, cancer drug databases and
other online resources were downloaded from different sources including cancer.gov (maintained by the National Cancer Institute,
available at https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/drugs), Chemocare (reviewed by the Cleveland Clinic and community
resources, available at http://chemocare.com/chemotherapy/drug-info/default.aspx), CenterWatch (information about clinical trials
and FDA approved drugs, available at https://www.centerwatch.com/drug-information/fda-approved-drugs/therapeutic-area/12/
oncology), NavigatingCare (mostly patient based, available at https://www.navigatingcare.com/library/all/chemotherapy_drugs),

 SEER*Rx (antineoplastic drug database maintained by the National Cancer Institute, available at https://seer.cancer.gov/tools/

generated by the pipeline and the downloaded resource.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All statistical details of the in vitro experiments are described in the figure legends. Additional descriptions of software, packages and
algorithms employed for the analysis of RNA sequencing data and in silico simulations are described below:
Intracellular metabolomics analysis
Because we could not assume equal variances for both conditions (simulated HF regimen versus REF medium, +/� LGG) and to
increase the statistical power by taking into consideration Type 1 as well as Type 2 error rates, we applied the Welch’s t test for
metabolomics data analysis (Ruxton, 2006). The Welch t test provides more robustness to an analysis than the regular Student t
test, and thus, the Welch t test is commonly applied in metabolomics datasets (Kogel et al., 2010; Theriot et al., 2014). Statistical
analyses were performed separately by comparing dietary regimen (HF versus REF) and dietary regimen + LGG (HF + LGG versus
REF + LGG). Bacterial intracellular metabolites were analyzed by comparing HF + LGG versus REF + LGG. A P value of less than 0.05
was considered significant for all analyses. Metabolite replicates with one ‘no match’ hit technical replicate were removed from the
dataset. A total of 155 metabolites were detected in Caco-2 cells in each condition. 50 statistically significant metabolites were iden-
tified in HF-exposed versus REF-exposed Caco-2 cells (See also Table S1); 44 statistically significant metabolites were identified
when Caco-2 cells were exposed to HF + LGG versus REF + LGG (See also Table S5); 33 statistically significant metabolites
were identified in LGG when exposed to HF versus REF medium (See also Table S4).
SCFA quantification
For SCFAs absolute quantification, an external calibration curve (10, 25, 50,100, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 mmol/L) using a volatile
free acid mix (Sigma-Aldrich) including all compounds of interest was prepared, extracted, and derivatized as described above. A
total of four volatile acids were measured in the LGG spent medium: Acetic acid, butyric acid, formic acid, and propionic acid.
The absolute quantification of each metabolite produced by LGG was performed in the medium with background subtraction
from fresh medium and normalized to cell count.
In silico analysis
Simulations were performed on the two dietary regimens for (i) the COAD model, (ii) the LGG model, and (iii) the joint COAD/LGG
model. In each of these six conditions, the minimal and maximal fluxes through each reaction were computed using a computation-
ally efficient flux variability analysis (Gudmundsson and Thiele, 2010). For each reaction, the flux span was calculated, which is the
absolute distance between the computed minimal and maximal flux values. The minimal and maximal fluxes for each reaction were
plotted in MATLAB. The predicted secretion into the body fluids and lumen were visualized using the pheatmap and RColorBrewer
functions in R version 3.3.2 (R Core Team, 2016). Heatmaps were generated with the Euclidian distance measure for clustering rows
and columns, and complete linkage as the hierarchical clustering method. Reactions with at least a 20% difference in flux span
between conditions were plotted. The thicknesses of the lines per reaction were scaled to fold changes in the flux spans between
conditions.
RNA-sequencing analysis
To ensure complete removal of all rRNA in the bacterial samples, we performed in silico rRNA depletion using sortmeRNA (Bonsai
Bioinformatics) (Kopylova et al., 2012). For the human samples, rRNA depletion was not performed as only mRNAs were sequenced.
The rRNA depletion was required only for the bacterial samples, as rRNA made up 85% of the total RNA, to avoid that all other RNA
classes are masked (Rosenow et al., 2001; Scott et al., 2010). The remaining reads were mapped to the LGG reference genome using
bowtie2 (BOWTIE) (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) with a default setting at the very-sensitive-local mode. The reference genome was
reannotated using eggnog-mapper based on eggNOG 4.5 orthology data (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2017), and gene counts were strand
based, applying an in-house script.
Differential expression analysis
The DESeq2 (1.16.1) (Anders and Huber, 2010) package from R (3.4.1) (R Core Team, 2016) was used to identify genes that were
differentially expressed (DE) due to dietary regimen. In a similar approach, Caco-2 transcriptomic datasets were aligned against
the Ensembl human genome reference (release-87) using the STAR (2.5.2b) aligner (Dobin et al., 2013) with default parameters,
except for chimSegmentMin, which was set to 20 to switch on the detection of chimeric alignments. A GTF file (release-87)
with the annotated transcripts was also provided to increase the accuracy of the alignments. Gene counts were calculated using
featureCounts (v1.5.2) (Liao et al., 2014), requiring both ends to be mapped as well as strand specificity. To filter out genes that
could be derived from spurious mapping, only genes that collected at least 0.0001% of the reads for a minimum of two samples
e8
Cell Reports 27, 1621–1632.e1–e9, April 30, 2019
 from the same condition were retained. Generalized linear models were applied to calculate the differential gene expression
and statistical significance per dietary regimen, type of culture (monoculture or coculture) and their interaction using DESeq2
(Anders and Huber, 2010). Figures for LGG and Caco-2 transcriptomic analysis were generated using the R packages gplots,
superheat, ggplot2 and tidyverse.
Pathway enrichment analysis
Pathway enrichment analysis on the Caco-2 differentially expressed gene list (simulated HF regimen versus REF medium, and HF +
LGG versus REF + LGG) was performed using MetaCore (Clarivate Analytics), using only the statistically significant genes as a
sorting method. DE genes with an absolute log2-fold change value higher than 1 and an adjusted P value lower than 0.05 were
used as a sorting method for Caco-2 cells. LGG pathway and module enrichment was performed using the R packages KEGGREST
(Tenenbaum, 2017) and stats (R Core Team, 2017) (hypergeometric distribution function). Figures for LGG and Caco-2 transcriptomic
analysis were generated with the R packages gplots, superheat, ggplot2 and tidyverse.
