Abstract
Early childhood inorganic arsenic (i-As) exposure is of particular concern since it may
adversely impact on lifetime health outcomes. Infants’ urinary arsenic (As) metabolites were
analysed in 79 infants by inductively coupled plasma—mass spectrometric detection (IC-
ICP-MS) to evaluate i-As exposure pre- and post-weaning. Levels of i-As in rice-based
weaning and infants’ foods were also determined to relate to urinary As levels. Higher As
levels, especially of monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), were
found in urine from formula fed infants compared to those breastfed. Urine from infants
post-weaning consuming rice-products resulted in higher urinary MMA and DMA compared
to the paired pre-weaning urine samples. The European Union (EU) has regulated i-As in
rice since 1st January 2016. Comparing infants’ rice-based foods before and after this date,
little change was found. Nearly of the rice-based products specifically marketed for infants
and young children contained i-As over the 0.1 mg/kg EU limit. Efforts should be made to
provide low i-As rice and rice-based products consumed by infants and young children that
do not exceed the maximum i-As level to protect this vulnerable subpopulation.
Introduction
Early-life exposure to i-As, even at relatively low concentrations, is of particular concern due
to infants and young children’s specific vulnerability to the adverse health effects of this group
I human carcinogen, which may impact health and disease development throughout their life-
span, including neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic outcomes [1–5]. Diet
dominates i-As exposure when low i-As drinking water is available, especially for infants and
young children due to their higher food consumption per body weight unit, and low dietary
diversity dominated by breast milk or formula during the first 4–6 months followed by the

 introduction of solid foods such as rice-based products [6–10]. Breast milk contains low i-As
concentrations, even in areas with high drinking water i-As, and thus exclusively breastfeeding
has been suggested to protect infants from i-As exposure [8,11]. Formula powder can contain
relatively low concentrations of i-As, and water used to mix the powdered formula may add
significantly to the final concentration in the ready-made products. Non-dairy formulas con-
tain higher i-As compared to dairy based formulas especially those that are rice-fortified where
the highest As concentrations have been reported [12,13]. Rice and rice-based products are a
reported source of i-As since they contain higher i-As concentrations compared to other food-
stuffs, and are widely used during weaning, and to feed young children, due to its availability,
bland taste, nutritional value and relatively low allergic potential [7,9,14–16]. Therefore, the
EU has regulated the maximum levels of i-As in rice since January 2016 [17]. The most
restricted level has been set at 0.1 mg/kg for rice-based foods destined for infants and young
children and, in 2016, this threshold for rice destined for the production of food for infants
and young children was proposed by the United States (US) [18]. In spite of these concerns
regarding As in infants’ food, there is limited information available regarding infants’ dietary
i-As exposure before weaning, and the impact of the EU i-As regulation in rice on infants’ i-As
exposure once starting to consume solid foods, particularly for low i-As drinking water
regions.
In this study urinary As speciation was carried out to assess the exposure levels in infants
that were either breast or formula fed before weaning and after weaning. Moreover, As specia-
tion was determined in rice-based products destined for infants and young children com-
monly used during weaning. The i-As levels of these foods were compared with the EU i-As
standard, and discussed with the i-As concentrations previously reported in the same rice-
based products analysed before the EU standard enforcement.
Materials and methods
Infant urine samples and sample preparation
The Office for Research Ethics Committees Northern Ireland (ORECNI; reference 14/NI/
0047), and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust approved the protocol of the study. Partici-
pants (mothers) provided informed written consent to participate. Mothers consented on
behalf of the infants in a written consent. The protocol was designed to look at nutritional fac-
tors throughout pregnancy and into the neonatal period. Pre- and post-weaning urine samples
were collected from infants from Belfast, Northern Ireland. Infants were enrolled at birth and
a subset was followed up after weaning. Infant’s mothers met the inclusion criteria of �19
years old, non-smoker, white Caucasian, healthy nutritional status, and delivery scheduled at
the reference hospital (Royal Jubilee Maternity Hospital, Belfast Health and Social Care Trust).
About 70% of mothers were classified in the upper socioeconomic status, which included man-
agers, senior technical staff, freelance professionals, intermediate occupations and managers in
commerce. The infants included in the study were 41 girls and 38 boys, born in 2015, and clas-
sified according to the feeding mode before weaning as breastfed (n = 20), formula fed
(n = 32), and partially breastfed (mixture of both methods) (n = 27). Information regarding
pre-weaning infants’ rice-based formula consumption was not available. The pre-weaning
urine samples were collected from infants with a median and range of 3.4 (1.3–6.7) months
old. In a subset of 11 of these infants, born in September/October 2015, with a median and
range of 2.1 (1.3–6.5) months old at pre-weaning sample collection, in addition to the pre-
weaning samples post-weaning follow-up urine samples were collected once they reached a
median and range of 7.7 (6.6–9.3) months old. At that time an interview with their mothers

 confirmed that 91% of the infants consumed rice or any rice-based product as part of their
weaning diet.
Single spot urine samples, which are considered a good As exposure biomarker as opposed
to 24-h or first morning void [19], were collected from the infant study population at home
using cotton pads with As species content tested in blank samples, and clinically used for
infants’ urine samples collection (Unisurge International Limited). The same type of cotton
pad was used throughout the study, and they were provided along with detailed usage instruc-
tion before a scheduled visit at the infants’ reference pediatric clinic at Royal Jubilee Maternity
Hospital, Belfast. If home collection was not possible, the infants’ urine sample was collected at
the reference hospital during the scheduled visit. The urine was squeezed from the cotton
pads, divided into aliquots, and frozen at or below -20ºC until analysis. Then, they were centri-
fuged with a Sorvall Legend RT at 4,500 rpm/2,200 g and 10 μl of analytical grade hydrogen
peroxide (Normapur 30% H2O2) was added to 1 ml of sample to convert any arsenite to arse-
nate, to facilitate subsequent chromatographic detection as described in our previous publica-
tion [20]. The same procedure was applied for the blank cotton pad samples prepared by
soaking them with ultrapure water or urine with known arsenic species content. Replicate
samples of the certified reference material (CRM) urine ClinChek1—Control level I and
blank samples were included in each analysis batch as quality control. The urine samples
included in this study were not dilution adjusted. Solid food introduction into infant’s weaning
diet may affect urine dilution, however, only minor changes were expected with a negligible
effect on the results. Little benefit has been suggested from urine adjustment in previous stud-
ies, which have reported a strong correlation between adjusted and non adjusted urine samples
with no significant differences in urinary As concentration, and disqualified the creatinine
adjustment method due to association with the level of urinary As [21–23].
Tap water in Belfast is a uniform supply with reported low As concentration [24]. However,
in order to provide a more descriptive As drinking-water level of exposure for the participants
in this study, 3 tap water samples from Belfast, a city that has a single water supply source, were
analysed for As speciation following the procedure described earlier for the urine samples.
Rice-based infant products and sample preparation
Based on market availability a representative number of baby rice (n = 13), rice crackers/cakes
(n = 29) and rice cereal (n = 31) samples belonging to 9 different most popular commercial
brands or manufacturers were purchased from 17 food shops including online shopping in
Belfast, Northern Ireland. Replicate samples of the sample products and brands were pur-
chased from different stores or from the same store, for a few rice-cereal samples, but with dif-
ferent batch code (S1 Table). The rice-based product samples were collected in February 2016
and their use by dates were between June 2016 and November 2017, covering the whole wean-
ing period for the children followed up in this study.
A Christ Alpha 1–4 LD Plus was used to freeze-dry all samples of rice-based products, and a
Retch PM100 mill to powder them. Powdered sample, 0.1 g, was accurately weighed into 50 ml
polypropylene centrifuge tubes and 10 ml of 1% concentrated nitric acid (Aristar 69% HNO3)
was added and left overnight. A CEM MARS 6 was used to microwave digest the samples, and
a Sorvall Legend RT to centrifuge them at 4,500 rpm/2,200 g. Then, a 1 ml aliquot was trans-
ferred to a 2 ml polypropylene vial and 10 μl of analytical grade hydrogen peroxide (Normapur
30% H2O2) was added to convert any arsenite to arsenate to facilitate subsequent chro-
matographic detection. Replicate samples of the CRM NIST 1568b rice flour and blank sam-
ples were included in each analysis batch as quality control. Further details regarding rice-
based product samples preparation can be found in our previous study [7].

 Chemical analysis
Ion chromatography with IC-ICP-MS was used to analyse As speciation in urine, rice-based
products, and water samples. It was a Thermo Scientific IC5000 ion chromatography (IC) sys-
tem, with a Thermo AS7, 2x250 mm column and a Thermo AG7, 2x50 mm guard column
interfaced with a Thermo ICAP Q ICP-MS in collision cell mode. A linear gradient mobile
phase was carried out over 15 minutes starting at 100% mobile phase of 20 mM ammonium
carbonate and finishing at 100% mobile phase of 200 mM ammonium carbonate. The resulting
chromatogram was compared with that for authentic standards; DMA, i-As, MMA, tetra-
tmethylarsonium (TETRA) and arsenobetaine (AsB). DMA concentration series were used to
calibrate the As present under each chromatographic peak. Further details regarding chemical
analysis can be found in our previous studies [7,25]
Statistical analysis
The As species concentrations were natural log transformed before studying the effect of the
feeding mode on As species concentrations in infants’ urine before weaning, and the effect of
the weaning process on urinary As species concentrations by applying analysis of variance
(ANOVA)—Tukey’s range test, and the paired t-test, respectively. All statistical analyses were
conducted within the R statistical package, version 3.2.3 [26]. The limit of detection (LOD)
was calculated as the mean of the blank concentrations plus three times the standard deviation
of the blank concentrations multiplied by the dilution factor. The ½ LOD value was assigned
for statistical analyses of the data when samples were below the LOD.
Results
CRM recoveries
The urine CRM ClinChek1—Control level I percentage recovery ± SE was 113 ± 2%,
95 ± 2%, 102 ± 2%, and 95 ± 2% for i-As, MMA, DMA, and AsB, respectively, based on N = 9.
The rice CRM flour NIST-1568b percentage recovery ± SE was 99 ± 1%, 126 ± 2%, and
101 ± 3% for i-As, MMA, and DMA, respectively, based on N = 4 (S2 Table). The LOD for As
speciation, calculated from DMA calibration, were 0.005 μg/l and 0.003 mg/kg for the urine
and rice-based product samples, respectively. Consistent trace levels of As close or below the
LOD were found in the blank samples squeezed from cotton pads soaked with ultrapure water,
and no differences in the urinary arsenic species content were found in the urine blank sam-
ples squeezed from the cotton pads.
Urinary As speciation
All the urinary i-As, DMA, AsB, and 87% of MMA concentrations were higher than the LOD
in the pre-weaning samples (n = 79). All the urinary i-As, MMA, DMA, and 91% of AsB con-
centrations were higher than the LOD in the post-weaning samples (n = 11). Total As (t-As)
was calculated as the summation of i-As, MMA, and DMA, excluding AsB. Urine samples
from pre-weaning infants, exclusively formula fed, had higher log MMA, log DMA and log t-
As concentrations compared to those exclusively breastfed or partially breastfed (p<0.001,
p = 0.001, p = 0.001, respectively) (Fig 1). The median urinary MMA, DMA, and t-As concen-
trations in pre-weaning urine from formula fed infants was 6.7-, 2.2-, and 1.9-fold higher com-
pared to the levels found in samples from breastfed children, respectively (Table 1). Urine
samples from post-weaning infants had higher log MMA, log DMA and log t-As concentra-
tions compared to the paired pre-weaning samples (p = 0.013, p = 0.005 and p = 0.008, respec-
tively) (Fig 2). The median urinary MMA, DMA, and t-As concentrations in post-weaning

 urine samples were 7.2-, 9.1-, and 4.8-fold higher compared to the level found in the paired
pre-weaning samples (Table 2). The urine samples from post-weaning infants tended to have
higher i-As concentration (p = 0.067), which was 1.6-fold higher than that for the pre-weaning
urine paired samples (Table 2 and Fig 2). No significant differences were found in urinary
AsB concentration according to feeding mode before weaning or due to the weaning process
(Fig 1 and Fig 2).

 children exceeded the maximum i-As level of 0.1 mg/kg, ranging from 0.055 to 0.177 mg/kg
with a median of 0.117 mg/kg. When including rice cereals in the calculations, packaging of
which does not state that they are specifically for infants or young children, more than half of
the rice-based products dataset analysed in this study (56%; n = 73) exceeded the maximum i-
As standard with a median of 0.104 mg/kg. Almost 80% of the rice crackers, 61% of the baby
rice, and 32% of the rice cereals exceeded the maximum i-As level established for rice destined
for the production of food for infants and young children. Regarding baby rice samples, all
Brand D and E samples exceeded the EU maximum i-As level with a median i-As of 0.147 mg/
kg and 0.128 mg/kg, respectively. More than half of the baby rice Brand B samples analysed
had i-As concentrations over 0.1 mg/kg, and only Brand A complied with the regulation with
a median i-As of 0.056 mg/kg. All rice crackers belonging to Brand A and K, and almost all
Brand E rice cracker samples, had higher i-As concentrations than 0.1 mg/kg with a median of
0.135 mg/kg, 0.153 mg/kg, and 0.117 mg/kg, respectively. Brand F and M rice cracker samples
complied with the regulation with a median i-As of 0.086 mg/kg and 0.065 mg/kg, respectively.
All Brand K, half of Brand F, and nearly one third of Brand J rice cereals i-As was over 0.1 mg/
kg with median i-As concentration of 0.135 mg/kg, 0.090 mg/kg, and 0.081 mg/kg, respec-
tively. Only Brand H rice cereal had lower i-As with a median of 0.078 mg/kg. The i-As con-
centration for the whole rice-based products dataset represented a median percentage of 74%
of the summation of all As species, ranging from 46% to 86%. Thus, the i-As concentration
was the predominant As specie in the rice-based products analysed followed by DMA, with a
median and range concentration of 0.027 (0.013–0.109) mg/kg, and traces of MMA (Table 3).
Discussion
In this study infants who were fed exclusively with formula had higher exposure levels to As
compared to those exclusively breastfed or partially breastfed as determined by a higher uri-
nary concentration of DMA and MMA. Moreover, the weaning process increased the As expo-
sure and infants post-weaning had higher urinary DMA and MMA concentrations compared
to pre-weaning. Infants had access to very low As drinking-water (<0.1 μg/l, including i-As
and DMA). Therefore, rice-based product consumption with high i-As concentration may
play a predominant role in the infants’ dietary i-As exposure since more than 90% of them
confirmed consuming these products during weaning.
Higher median t-As (0.41μg/l), excluding AsB, was found here for infants before weaning
regardless of the feeding mode than that reported in breast and formula-fed infants at approxi-
mately 6 weeks of age from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS) in the US
(0.17 μg/l), but lower compared to that reported in a highly As exposed population in Bangla-
desh (median of 1.2 μg/l, specific gravity adjusted, for breastfed and partially breastfed
3-months-old infants)[8,11].
Urinary As concentrations have been reported to be higher for formula fed infants com-
pared to those exclusively breastfed (p < 0.0001) belonging to the NHBCS [8], and this study
agrees with that. In addition, the study here goes further and provides information about uri-
nary As metabolites, and reports that urinary DMA and MMA were affected by the feeding
mode, concentrations of which were higher for formula fed infants compared to those
breastfed. This increment of DMA and MMA in urine from infants formula fed may reflect i-
As exposure since i-As is expected to be the main As specie in powdered formulas [6,27,28]. It
also corroborates the early childhood ability to methylate i-As, which has been reported to be
more efficient for children compared to adults [29]. Although further studies are needed to
better evaluate infant’s ability to methylate i-As exposure it seems that formula fed infants had
a stronger methylation ability, associated with a lower relative amount of urinary i-As, and

 higher relative amount of MMA and DMA, compared to those breastfed. DMA and MMA are
the end metabolites of the i-As metabolism, however, it is important to bear in mind that reac-
tive highly toxic intermediate metabolites such as DMAIII and MMAIII may be formed and
pose health concerns [28].
Rice and rice-based products are common during the weaning process and when feeding
young children, especially those suffering from celiac disease, however, they may contain high
concentrations of i-As, and therefore maximum i-As levels have been established to protect

APercentage of samples exceeding the i-As EU maximum level for rice destined for the production of food for infants and young children. The 2014 data are

 the most vulnerable subpopulations such as infants and young children [7,17,30]. In this
study, nearly of the baby rice and the rice crackers labelled specifically for infants and young
children exceeded the EU maximum i-As limit (0.1 mg/kg). Rice-based product As content
was dominated by i-As, however, a wide i-As concentration range was found (Table 3). Higher
i-As content has been previously found in rice-based products containing brown rice com-
pared to those manufactured with polished rice [7,31]. The rice growing origin has also been
identified to affect rice i-As content in prior studies, and rice grown in the EU, characterised
by a high relative amount of i-As, is expected to be predominant in the rice-based products
included in this study [10,32]. Little changes were found in the i-As concentration in baby rice,
rice crackers, and rice cereals compared to the same rice-based products previously tested in
2014 before the EU i-As standard in rice (Table 3) [7]. The Brand B baby rice suggested an
increase in i-As concentration just above the maximum limit in comparison with the median
level found in 2014. Also Brand E rice crackers, and Brand J and K rice cereal sample batches
indicated an increment of the number of samples with higher i-As concentrations than the EU
limit compared to the same sample batches analysed in 2014. No changes in the i-As concen-
trations were found in Brand D and E baby rice, and Brand A rice cracker samples before and
after the regulation despite their high concentration over 0.1 mg/kg. Only Brand F rice crack-
ers showed a reduction of i-As concentration below 0.1 mg/kg, complying with the maximum
limit. The exceedance of the i-As standard emphasises the urgent need for low i-As rice used
to manufacture infants’ and young childrens’ food, which could be obtained by applying novel
ways of rice processing or by identifying low i-As rice growing regions [10,32,33]. Rice cereal
packaging does not state that they are specifically for infants or young children and thus fall
under higher concentration categories despite the fact that they are widely consumed by
young children and may contain over 0.1 mg/kg of i-As as reported in the study here and oth-
ers [7]. This also applies to other rice and rice-based products not specifically labelled for
infants and young children, which contribute to the i-As exposure of this vulnerable subpopu-
lation. Indeed, significantly higher urinary concentrations of DMA and MMA have been
found here for children after weaning once 6–9 months old, which is the most common
reported period to introduce rice-based products into young children’s diets [9], compared to
those before starting consuming solid foods. This urinary increment of DMA and MMA may
reflect i-As exposure and thus health risks as pointed out earlier. However, the methylated spe-
cies may also be excreted in the urine unchanged lessening health risks, since noticeable levels
of DMA and traces of MMA have been reported in food including rice and rice-based prod-
ucts in contrast with the very low As levels in the Northern Ireland drinking water found in
this study [7]. Higher urinary DMA have been previously associated with rice consumption in
children and adults [22,34]. It is worth mentioning the increment trend of urinary i-As found
in children post-weaning despite the small sample size, which may be related to a highly toxic
i-As fraction excreted in the urine unchanged [28]. Urinary As concentration has recently
been associated with rice cereal and rice snack consumption in young children at 12 months
belonging to the NHBCS in the US, where the 0.1 mg i-As/kg threshold for rice destined for
the production of food for infants and young children is still under consideration, and i-As
concentrations higher than that level have been reported in rice-based products [7,9]. They
found that young children consuming rice-based products had an average of 2.5-fold higher
urinary t-As compared to those that did not consume them. Urinary As speciation was also
carried out in a subset of samples with rice consumption, concentration pattern of which was
similar to that found here in post-weaning infants for i-As (0.24 μg/l) and DMA (3.00 μg/l),
but lower MMA (0.92 μg/l) [9]. These high levels of urinary arsenic concentrations in infants
post-weaning consuming rice-based products after the EU i-As regulation in rice suggests little
impact of the regulation on infants’ i-As exposure, and indicates that efforts should be made to
