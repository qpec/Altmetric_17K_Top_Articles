SUMMARY
A carbohydrate-restricted diet is a widely recom-
mended intervention for non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD), but a systematic perspective
on the multiple benefits of this diet is lacking.
Here, we performed a short-term intervention with
an isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with increased
protein content in obese subjects with NAFLD
and characterized the resulting alterations in meta-
bolism and the gut microbiota using a multi-omics
approach.
We
observed
rapid
and
dramatic
reductions of liver fat and other cardiometabolic
risk factors paralleled by (1) marked decreases in
hepatic de novo lipogenesis; (2) large increases in
serum b-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, reflecting
increased mitochondrial b-oxidation; and (3) rapid
increases in folate-producing Streptococcus and
serum folate concentrations. Liver transcriptomic
analysis on biopsy samples from a second cohort
revealed downregulation of the fatty acid synthesis
pathway and upregulation of folate-mediated one-
carbon metabolism and fatty acid oxidation path-
ways. Our results highlight the potential of exploring
diet-microbiota interactions for treating NAFLD.
INTRODUCTION
In the past 30 years, we have seen a marked increase in non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and it is now the most
common cause of chronic liver disease in western countries
(Chalasani et al., 2012; Rinella and Sanyal, 2016). NAFLD can
progress from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), which is characterized by the additional presence of an
inflammatory infiltrate and hepatocellular injury with or without
fibrosis (Chalasani et al., 2012; Rinella and Sanyal, 2016), and
may further progress to cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular
carcinoma (Marengo et al., 2016). Increasing evidence also
indicates that NAFLD is a significant independent risk factor for
cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes (Lonardo et al.,
2015; Targher et al., 2016), and the dyslipidemia that is present
in many individuals with NAFLD potentially contributes to the
link between these diseases (Gaggini et al., 2013).
The pathophysiology of NAFLD has not been resolved, but it
develops when the influx of lipids into the liver exceeds hepatic
lipid disposal (by fatty acid oxidation and triglyceride secretion
as lipoprotein particles) (Stefan et al., 2008). Potential sources
of lipids contributing to fatty liver include fatty acids released
into the circulation from peripheral adipose tissue, dietary fatty
acids from intestinal chylomicrons, and lipids synthesized
(mostly from carbohydrates) in the liver by de novo lipogenesis
(DNL) (Donnelly et al., 2005). In hyperinsulinemic subjects with
NAFLD, hepatic DNL accounts for approximately 25% of liver
triglyceride content (Diraison et al., 2003; Donnelly et al.,
2005); thus, carbohydrate restriction, combined with exercise
and regular follow-up, has emerged as an effective dietary
intervention for obesity (Astrup et al., 2004; Foster et al.,
2003) and NAFLD (Rinella and Sanyal, 2016). In addition to their
effects on liver fat, carbohydrate-restricted diets have been
shown to promote marked shifts in the composition of the gut
microbiota (David et al., 2014; Duncan et al., 2007). Further-
more, accumulating evidence suggests that microbial changes
are implicated in the development and progression of NAFLD
(Le Roy et al., 2013; Leung et al., 2016; Loomba et al., 2017),
and fecal microbiota transplantation has been shown to be

 able to alleviate high-fat-induced steatohepatitis in mice
(Zhou et al., 2017).
A systematic perspective integrating dietary intervention,
microbial profiling, and in-depth metabolic characterizations in
humans with NAFLD is lacking. Given the complexity of NAFLD
pathogenesis, in-depth multi-omics profiling—an approach
that has recently been used in studies of both human wellness
and disease (Chen et al., 2012; Price et al., 2017; Wu et al.,
2015)—would likely offer valuable insights into understanding
how a carbohydrate-restricted diet promotes reduced hepatic
steatosis. Here we performed a 2-week intervention with an
isocaloric carbohydrate-restricted diet in obese subjects with
NAFLD and used multi-omics profiling to investigate how the
diet and associated changes in the gut microbiota contribute
to improved liver fat metabolism. In addition, we combined
plasma metabolomics and liver transcriptomics in a genome-
scale metabolic model to further investigate the metabolic
responses to this diet intervention.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Reduced Carbohydrate Consumption Has Rapid Effects
on Liver Fat
Earlier studies designed to reduce hepatic steatosis in subjects
with NAFLD have usually combined carbohydrate restriction
with calorie reduction and did not separate out the effect of
amplified weight loss (Browning et al., 2006, 2011). To investi-
gate how liver fat metabolism is affected by reduced carbo-
hydrate consumption without a concomitant reduction in calorie
intake, we served a pre-prepared isocaloric low-carbohydrate
diet with increased protein content (<30 g of carbohydrates
and an average of 3,115 kcal per day; Figure 1A; Table S1)
for 14 days to ten subjects with obesity and high liver fat
(mean ± SEM 16.0% ± 2.3%). The study design is shown in Fig-
ure 1B. To minimize the weight loss that is known to occur on a
short-term isocaloric carbohydrate-restricted diet (Kekwick and
Pawan, 1956), the study subjects were in daily contact with a
dietician and were instructed to increase their daily energy intake
whenever their weight decreased between two study days by
more than 0.2 kg.
There were no changes in waist circumference during the
study (Table S1). Despite good compliance, we observed a slight
weight loss (1.8% ± 0.2% of their body weight; Figure 1C). Body
composition analysis at baseline and after 14 days on the diet
revealed that decreases in fat mass and water were the major
contributors to this minor weight loss (Figure 1D). In contrast to
the small reduction in weight loss, we observed dramatic reduc-
tions in liver fat, as measured by magnetic resonance spectros-
copy (MRS), in all the individuals over the 14-day study period
(mean reduction 43.8%; Figure 1E). Of note, the reduction
was significant just 1 day after the start of the diet intervention
(p = 0.027) and was paralleled by a significant decrease in total
liver volume (Figure S1).
We observed marked reductions in very-low-density lipo-
protein (VLDL)-triglycerides (mean reduction 56.7%; Figure 1F)
and in fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations (mean reduction
48.4%; Table S1) at the end of the study. In addition, we found a
significant reduction of plasma apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III)
(Figure 1G), an inhibitor of VLDL clearance (Ginsberg et al.,
1986) and a strong correlation between decreases in the concen-
tration of apoC-III and VLDL-triglycerides over the study period
(r = 0.91, p = 0.0015; Figure S2). We also analyzed the composi-
tion of VLDL-triglycerides and observed a decreased proportion
of saturated fatty acids including myristic acid (14:0) and palmitic
acid (16:0) and an increased proportion of unsaturated fatty
acids such as oleic acid (18:1) (Table S1). These data are
consistent with a significant increase in the number of double
bonds per fatty acid chain observed by MRS of the liver over
the study period (Table S1).
To test whether the marked reductions in liver fat were linked
to the diet intervention, we performed a follow-up MRS in seven
of the ten participants 1–3 months after completing the interven-
tion study and returning to their normal diet. We observed that
their liver fat content returned to a level similar to that measured
before the diet intervention (11.3% ± 1.6% at follow-up versus
13.8% ± 2.5% at baseline, p = 0.08).
Reduced Carbohydrate Consumption Improves Liver Fat
Metabolism
To investigate the effects of the diet on processes linked to fat
accumulation in the liver, we measured DNL using stable isotope
technology and b-hydroxybutyrate (a proxy for b-oxidation). We
observed a rapid and dramatic reduction in absolute DNL (Fig-
ure 1H), which was paralleled by a rapid increase in hepatic
b-oxidation (Figure 1I). At the end of the 14-day diet intervention,
DNL was 79.8% lower and b-hydroxybutyrate was 4.9-fold
higher than at baseline (Figures 1H and 1I). However, there
was no significant change in plasma non-esterified fatty acid
(NEFA) concentrations over the study period (Table S1). Further-
more, there was a strong correlation between the reductions in
DNL and liver fat (r = 0.96, p = 0.0001) and a trend toward a
significant correlation between the reductions in DNL and
VLDL-triglycerides (r = 0.67, p = 0.07) (Figure S2). Consistent
with improvements in liver function and metabolism, we
observed significant reductions in fasting plasma concentrations
of alkaline phosphatase and aspartate transaminase, markers of
liver damage, as well as significant decreases in fasting insulin
and HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resis-
tance) values over the study period (Table S1).
Studies characterizing the pathogenesis of NAFLD have
focused overwhelmingly on the dysregulation of hepatic DNL
(Chakravarthy et al., 2005; Fabbrini et al., 2010; Petersen et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2015) and increased delivery of NEFAs from
adipose tissue to the liver especially in insulin-resistant subjects
(Lewis et al., 2002); according to one estimation (Donnelly et al.,
2005), these pathways account for 25% and 60% of liver fat,
respectively. In contrast, the roles of the pathways involved in
hepatic lipid disposal (i.e., mitochondrial b-oxidation and
VLDL-triglyceride export) in NAFLD pathogenesis are less char-
acterized. By restricting carbohydrate intake and thus blunting
DNL, we observed a dramatic reduction of liver fat paralleled
by a rapid increase of mitochondrial b-oxidation and a marked
reduction of VLDL-triglycerides without any change in plasma
NEFA concentrations. Thus, the reduced hepatic lipid accumula-
tion could be explained by both blunted DNL and enhanced
mitochondrial b-oxidation; however, as their regulation is tightly
connected (McGarry et al., 1977) it is difficult to estimate the rela-
tive contribution of these two sources in our study.

 Reduced Carbohydrate Consumption Decreases
Inflammatory Markers and FGF21
NAFLD has been linked to a low-grade systemic inflammation
(Asrih and Jornayvaz, 2013; Braunersreuther et al., 2012), and
high carbohydrate intake has been shown to associate with
higher inflammation (Solga et al., 2004). We therefore investigated
the effect of the dietary intervention on a range of inflammation-
related plasma proteins. We observed significant reductions in
many of the inflammatory markers over the study period (Fig-
ure 1J). In particular, we showed that plasma concentrations of
interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a)
were significantly reduced after 14 days of the carbohydrate-
restricted diet (Figure 1J). IL-6 and TNF-a have attracted partic-
ular attention because the severity of NAFLD and progression
to NASH are associated with higher systemic levels of these
cytokines (Paredes-Turrubiarte et al., 2016; Wieckowska et al.,
2008). However, we did not observe significant reductions in
these cytokines after 3 days on the diet, indicating that they are
not the main drivers of liver fat.
Several studies have shown that concentrations of the peptide
hormone fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) are elevated in
subjects with NAFLD and correlate with hepatic fat content
(Dushay et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010), and plasma FGF21 has
been suggested as a potential diagnostic marker of NAFLD
(Li et al., 2013). Consistent with these findings, we showed that
plasma concentrations of FGF21 decreased rapidly in response
to the carbohydrate-restricted diet, with significant reductions
after both 3 and 14 days on the diet (Figure 1J). Paradoxically,
plasma FGF21 concentrations in rodents increase in response
to low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets (Badman et al., 2007,
2009; Laeger et al., 2014). One potential explanation for this dif-
ference is that FGF21 expression in rodents has been shown to
be sensitive to the protein content of the diet (Laeger et al., 2014).
Ketogenic diets given to rodents typically contain reduced
protein levels compared with control diet, in contrast to our
study diet with increased protein content. An earlier study also
reported diet-induced reductions in FGF21 concentrations in
humans upon increased protein intake (Christodoulides et al.,
2009). Moreover, plasma concentrations of FGF21 are increased
in individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery (Lips et al.,
2014), a treatment that is commonly associated with protein
malnutrition (Bal et al., 2012). We therefore speculate that the
protein content in the diet plays important roles in regulating
human FGF21 expression.
Reduced Carbohydrate Consumption Induces Rapid
Shifts in the Gut Microbiota Composition
Because of the increasing evidence supporting a link between
diet, the gut microbiota, and NAFLD (Leung et al., 2016), we
investigated how the gut microbiome was affected by the dietary
intervention. We performed whole-genome shotgun sequencing
of fecal samples obtained from the participants at five time
points across the study (0, 1, 3, 7, and 14 days). On average,
we obtained 17.5 million paired-end reads for each sample
(ranging from 14.2 million to 21.3 million; Table S2). Ninety-four
bacterial strains were significantly altered upon dietary interven-
tion (Figure 2A; Table S2), and major shifts occurred after only
1 day of the dietary intervention (Figure 2A). Principal coordinate
analysis (PCoA) of the relative abundance of all these signifi-
cantly altered strains confirmed the dramatic compositional
shifts of the gut microbiome after 1 day (Adonis test; p = 0.049;
Figure 2B). These observations are consistent with earlier
studies that reported rapid alterations in both microbial compo-
sition (David et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2011) and bacterial
growth rate (Korem et al., 2015) in response to extreme dietary
interventions. We observed further compositional shifts after
7 days, but not between 7 and 14 days (Figure 2B), suggesting
that the compositional shifts stabilized after 1 week on the low-
carbohydrate diet with increased protein content. Among the
top ten most abundant of 25 significantly altered genera, only
Streptococcus, Lactococcus, and Eggerthella were increased
over the study period (Figure 2C; Table S2). The carbohydrate-
degrading bacteria Ruminoccocus, Eubacterium, Clostridium,
and Bifidobacterium were all decreased (Figure 2C; Table S2).
In parallel, we observed decreased carbohydrate fermentation
as shown by reductions in fecal concentrations of short-chain
fatty acids (SCFAs) (Figure 2D), in agreement with previous
studies (David et al., 2014; Duncan et al., 2007).
Diet-Induced Functional Shifts in the Gut Microbiota
Increase Folate Production
To further investigate functional changes in the gut microbiome
in response to the dietary intervention, we annotated genes to
KEGG orthology (KO) (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). In total, 598
and 580 KOs were significantly increased and decreased,
respectively, after 14 days on the diet (Figure S3; Table S2).
Pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that these 1,178
KOs were involved in 18 KEGG pathways (Figure 3A). Of these,
the most upregulated pathways were those involved in folate
biosynthesis and the two-component system (which controls
gene expression in response to changes in environmental condi-
tions in many bacterial species), whereas the pathways involved
in starch and sucrose metabolism and biosynthesis of amino
acids including branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs; valine,
leucine, and isoleucine) were significantly decreased (Figure 3A).
Notably, the folate biosynthesis and starch and sucrose meta-
bolism pathways were significantly altered after only 1 day of di-
etary intervention (Figure 3A). In-depth analysis of bacterial folate
biosynthesis pathways showed that seven of 12 related KOs
were significantly increased over the study period (Figure 3B).
Of note, folate is a common food fermentation product during
the growth of Streptococcus and Lactococcus (LeBlanc et al.,
2011), and both of these lactic acid bacteria increased in abun-
dance over the study period (Figure 2C).
Both the gut microbiota and the diet are sources of serum
folate. Although folate is known to be present at higher levels
in diets rich in carbohydrates (e.g., from vegetables and cereals)
(Wittho
¨ ft et al., 1999), we did not observe any significant
changes in dietary folate when the participants changed to the
carbohydrate-restricted diet (Table S1). Furthermore, in contrast
to previous studies that reported reduced or no significant
changes in serum folate levels in response to carbohydrate-
restricted diets (Keogh et al., 2008; Noakes et al., 2005; Nuttall
and Gannon, 2006; Wycherley et al., 2010), we observed a signif-
icant increase in serum folate concentrations after just 1 day of
the diet (Figure 3C; p = 0.0039), in parallel with the rapid effect
of the diet on liver fat (Figure 1E). This discrepancy between
our study and earlier studies may be explained by differences
562
Cell Metabolism 27, 559–571, March 6, 2018
 in the macronutrient composition. Our diet had both increased
protein content compared with the baseline diet and very low
carbohydrate content (<10% energy from carbohydrates). It is
thus likely that the high dietary protein content combined with
the reduction in carbohydrate-dependent bacteria would drive
the growth of the folate-producing bacteria Streptococcus and
Lactococcus, resulting in increased bacterial folate production.
We also observed a trend toward an increase in fecal folate
when the participants changed to the low-carbohydrate diet
with increased protein content (Figure S4), suggesting that
bacterially produced folate could contribute to the diet-induced
increase in serum folate concentrations.
Our findings thus indicate that the increased circulating folate
could be a consequence of the altered microbial composition.
In support of this, previous studies have shown that the gut
microbiota can produce large quantities of folate (Kim et al.,
2004; Rossi et al., 2011; Strozzi and Mogna, 2008; Sugahara
et al., 2015) and that folate is absorbable across the colon in

 humans (Aufreiter et al., 2009). We thus provide the first
evidence indicating that a low-carbohydrate diet with increased
protein content can shift the gut microbiota toward increased
production of folate that is potentially utilized by humans. How-
ever, we cannot exclude the possibility that the carbohydrate-
restricted diet promoted enhanced dietary folate absorption in
the small intestine, resulting in increased circulating concentra-
tions of folate and favoring the growth of bacteria that produce
folate.
Folate and Associated Metabolites Are Linked to
Improved Liver Fat Metabolism
Animal studies have revealed that folate deficiency increases
expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and
TNF-a (Kolb and Petrie, 2013) and has detrimental effects on
hepatic lipid metabolism (Akesson et al., 1982), leading to
accumulation of liver fat (Kelley et al., 1950) and steatosis
(Christensen et al., 2010; Halsted et al., 2002). Growing
evidence also indicates a role for folate deficiency in the patho-
genesis of NAFLD in humans (Hirsch et al., 2005; Xia et al.,
2017). We therefore investigated whether serum folate corre-
lated with liver fat in our study. We first performed a correlation
analysis between these two variables for each individual in the
first cohort using data collected at seven time points across
the study (0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days). Despite the limited
number of sampling points, we observed significant correla-
tions in five of ten of these individuals and a trend toward signif-
icance in a further two (Figure 4A). No correlation between liver
fat and serum folate was observed in three individuals (Fig-
ure 4A), two of whom had the lowest liver fat in the cohort at
baseline (<10%); a lack of correlation in these two is likely
explained by the fact that their liver fat had reduced to normal
levels (<5%) by day 7 and thus plateaued (Figure 1E). However,
by performing a partial regression analysis between liver fat
and serum folate based on a linear mixed-effect model, we
observed an overall significant association between liver fat
and serum folate (p = 0.0001); according to this model, serum
folate could explain 35.4% and 19.5% of the variation in liver
fat before and after adjusting for BMI, respectively (Figure 4B).
To investigate whether there are other metabolites that could
potentially play a role in improved liver fat metabolism in our
study, we also performed untargeted metabolomics on plasma
samples from the participants at baseline and after 3 and
14 days on the dietary intervention. We observed significant

 changes in the relative signal intensity of 202 of 648 detected
metabolites over the study period, most of which are involved
in lipid or amino acid metabolism (Figure S5; Table S3).
In particular, we observed significant decreases in metabolites
involved in fatty acid synthesis (including those involved in phos-
pholipid, lysolipid, and diacylglycerol metabolism). Circulating
diacylglycerol concentrations have been repeatedly linked with
insulin resistance (Petersen et al., 2017); thus, reductions in diac-
ylglycerol are consistent with the improved insulin sensitivity
observed in this study (Table S1). We also observed significant
increases in metabolites involved in b-oxidation pathways and
plasmalogens, which are known antioxidants (Wallner and
Schmitz, 2011) (Figure S5; Table S3). Increased oxidative stress
is considered to contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD (Haas
et al., 2016), and antioxidants help to maintain the cellular redox
balance by neutralizing the oxidative stress produced by fatty
acid oxidation (Gambino et al., 2011), thereby alleviating NAFLD.
Nicotinamide and its methylation product 1-methylnicotinamide,
which has been shown to suppress liver triglyceride levels in
mice (Hong et al., 2015), were also increased during the dietary
intervention (Table S3).
By using multivariate dimension reduction and discriminant
analysis, we revealed that 48 of the 202 significantly altered
metabolites strongly correlated with serum folate (and thus liver
fat) as well as with the folate-producing bacteria Streptococcus
and Lactococcus (correlation coefficient cutoff 0.8; Figure 4C;
Table S3). Of note, b-hydroxybutyrate and most of the identified
plasmalogens associated with folate (Figure 4C; Table S3),
suggesting that folate may improve liver fat metabolism by pro-
moting an increase in mitochondrial b-oxidation and a reduction
of oxidative stress. In agreement, previous studies have demon-
strated that folate can confer protective effects against oxidative
stress (Sid et al., 2017). However, further efforts are needed
to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind the
multiple potential benefits provided by folate.
Liver Transcriptional Changes Reflect Improved Lipid
Metabolism
We also served the identical isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with
increased protein content to a second cohort of seven subjects
for 7 days. In this second cohort of similar age (p = 0.379) and
BMI (p = 0.230), we confirmed that the diet reduced DNL, fasting
plasma triglycerides, plasma concentrations of alkaline phos-
phatase and insulin, and HOMA-IR values (Table S4). Analysis
of liver biopsies taken from these subjects 7 days before the
study start and after 7 days of dietary intervention showed that
the diet significantly reduced the hepatic triglycerides by a
mean of 43.9% (Table S4). Notably, we also observed a significant
increase in serum folate concentrations in this cohort (Table S4).
To investigate whether alterations in hepatic gene expression
reflected the diet-induced improvements in lipid metabolism, we
also performed a global transcriptomic analysis on the liver sam-
ples collected from this second cohort. We observed significant
decreases in 9.1% of genes, whereas only 3.8% of genes
increased after 7 days on the diet (false discovery rate [FDR]
adjusted p value < 0.1; Table S5). KEGG pathway enrichment
analysis revealed that 34 pathways were upregulated, including
fatty acid degradation, amino acid metabolism, and peroxisome
proliferator-activated
receptor
(PPAR)
signaling
pathways,
whereas only seven pathways were downregulated, such as
ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation (Table S5).
Consistent
with
the
diet-induced
reductions
in
plasma
apoC-III concentrations and DNL noted earlier, we observed
decreased hepatic expression of APOC3 and FASN (although
no significant changes in SREBP-1c) in the second cohort after
7 days on the diet (Table S5). We also observed diet-induced in-
creases in the hepatic expression of PPAR-a and its downstream
genes (Figure 5), most of which are known to encode proteins
involved in the fatty acid oxidation including mitochondrial and
peroxisomal b-oxidation as well as microsomal u-oxidation (Fig-
ure 5) (Kersten, 2014; Pawlak et al., 2015). Intriguingly, both the

 gut microbiota (Crawford et al., 2009) and folate (Tryndyak et al.,
2012) have been shown to be able to regulate hepatic lipid meta-
bolism via a PPAR-a-regulated lipid catabolic pathway.
Expression of CAT, the gene encoding catalase, was also up-
regulated in response to the diet (Table S5). Hepatic expression
of the fatty acid transporter gene CD36 was not significantly
changed (Figure 5), in line with the lack of effect of the diet on
plasma NEFA concentrations in both cohorts (Tables S1 and
S4). Notably, consistent with the diet-induced increase in serum
folate concentrations in both cohorts (Figure 3C; Table S4), we
found diet-induced increases in the hepatic expression of genes
involved in folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism, including
MTRR, SHMT1, SHMT2, MTHFD1, and ALDH1L1 (Figure 6A),
and the proton-coupled folate transporter gene SLC46A1 (Table
S5). Serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) catalyzes the
interconversion of glycine and serine, and serine is required for
the generation of glutathione (GSH), an antioxidant that also
plays a role in maintaining b-oxidation (Mardinoglu et al., 2017;
Nguyen et al., 2013). We have previously shown that individuals
with NAFLD have serine deficiency (Mardinoglu et al., 2014,
2017) and that de novo GSH synthesis is altered in humans
with hepatic steatosis (Mardinoglu et al., 2017).
Finally, we integrated the liver transcriptomics and plasma
metabolomics
data

 genome-scale metabolic model of hepatocytes (Mardinoglu
et al., 2014). As expected, given the diet-induced reduction in
DNL, the model predicted a significant reduction of fluxes car-
ried by the reactions associated with glycolysis, the pentose
phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fig-
ure 6B; Table S6). The decreased fluxes in the reactions
involved in glycolysis and the TCA cycle were partly compen-
sated by increased fluxes in b-oxidation and BCAAs, required
to provide sufficient energy as well as substrates for the
biosynthesis of essential metabolites. Of note, we observed
that the fluxes carried by the reactions involved in folate and
methionine metabolism, serine uptake, as well as in the de
novo synthesis of GSH were significantly increased in response
to the diet. Our data are thus consistent with a central role of
folate in mediating one-carbon metabolism and its involvement
in a number of biosynthetic processes including synthesis of
glycine,
serine,
and
methionine
(Ducker
and
Rabinowitz,
2017; Sid et al., 2017).
Study Limitations
There are several strengths with this study, but there are also
limitations. For example, the study lacks a control group,
in which a normal carbohydrate diet was provided to subjects.
In addition, the types of carbohydrate, protein, and fat provided
during the diet intervention were not matched with the diet the
subjects consumed before the study. Therefore, it is possible
that changes in the types of macronutrients (e.g., refined sugars
versus complex carbohydrates, saturated versus unsaturated
fats, plant versus animal proteins) could have affected the
outcome measures.
Conclusions
In summary, by using a multi-omics approach, we showed that
short-term intervention with an isocaloric low-carbohydrate
diet
with
increased
protein
content
promotes
multiple
metabolic benefits in obese humans with NAFLD. In particular,
we observed a dramatic reduction of liver fat resulting from a
marked decrease in DNL and increase in b-oxidation. Of note,
our data indicate that rapid microbial shifts toward folate produc-
tion paralleled by increased circulating folate concentrations
may be partially behind the improved lipid metabolism, balanced
oxidative stress, and reduced inflammation. Taken together,
these findings are of important clinical interest in understanding
the pathogenesis and prevention of NAFLD. However, although
studies in mice have shown that folate supplementation protects
against high-fat-diet-induced liver steatosis (Sid et al., 2015,
2017), care should be taken before implementing folate supple-
mentation into clinical practice since long-term effects remain to
be elucidated.

 alcoholic liver disease as defined by daily alcohol intake of >40 g (men) and >20 g (women), respectively, significant endocrine
disease including diabetes, any medication acting on nuclear hormone receptors or inducing CYP P450, self-administration of
supplements other than calcium, any significant cardiovascular co-morbidity, history of non-compliance, and genetic variations
in the two main genetic determinants of liver fat accumulation: PNPLA3 (homozygous for I148M) or TM6SF2 (homozygous or
heterozygous for E167K).
Participants in the first cohort followed an isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with increased protein content for 14 days and came to
the study center on days 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 14 of the diet after an overnight fast. At each of these visits, subjects were weighed, blood
samples were taken and liver fat was measured (by MRS). Fecal samples were collected on days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14. The study design
with time-points for the different analyses performed is shown in Figure 1B.
To obtain liver biopsies from obese individuals with high liver fat before and after the low-carbohydrate diet with increased protein
content, we recruited a second cohort (5 men, 2 women; mean age 47.3±14.6 years). These subjects were mildly obese
(BMI 32.1±3.8 kg/m2) with ultrasound-verified fatty liver (but without diabetes or any medication) who underwent a Menghini liver
biopsy for the diagnosis of NASH. Those individuals from whom we obtained biopsies >4 cm (of which 2 cm was used for histological
confirmation of NAFLD/NASH with no advanced fibrosis; see Table S4) were asked to agree to a second biopsy within two weeks and
to follow the identical low-carbohydrate diet with increased protein content as the first cohort for 7 days until the morning before the
second biopsy. Blood samples were taken from the participants on the same day as their biopsies.
The study was performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and it was approved by the Helsinki University Central
Hospital Ethics Committee (for the first cohort) and the Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg (liver biopsy cohort).
Each subject gave written informed consent before participation in the study. A CONSORT flow diagram for the study is shown in
Figure S7.
Isocaloric Carbohydrate-Restricted Diet
Subjects in the first cohort were instructed to follow an isocaloric low-carbohydrate diet with increased protein content (providing a
mean of 3114.6 kcal energy per day) for 14 days. Each subject’s energy requirement was estimated (using the Harris Benedict
equation) from the basal metabolic rate (Roza and Shizgal, 1984), which was multiplied by 1.5 corresponding to the subject’s activity
level. The study diet provided approximately 4% energy from carbohydrate, 72% energy from fat and 24% energy from
protein whereas the corresponding macronutrient composition in the baseline diet was 40%, 42% and 18%, respectively (Figure 1A).
The carbohydrate content of the diet was restricted to 23-30 g per day.
To ensure compliance with the diet, subjects underwent a teaching session and had daily contact with an experienced dietitian.
Study subjects were asked to keep dietary records for 3 days beforehand to record the macronutrient content of the baseline diet.
All meals and snacks were pre-prepared in a metabolic kitchen and weighed and delivered to the subjects twice a week during the
14-day study period. The meals were frozen and the snacks and vegetables were fresh. The subjects were permitted to consume
calorie-free beverages and sweeteners. The dietician also instructed the participants to increase their daily energy intake by
200 kcal from macadamia nuts whenever their weight decreased between two study days by more than 0.2 kg. During the study,
all study subjects filled in a checklist of the meal consumed to keep track of meals eaten. The actual macronutrient intake
during the low-carbohydrate diet with increased protein content was calculated based on the checklists recorded by the subjects.
The dietitian contacted the participants daily (by phone or email) to verify adherence to the meal plan and check weight stability
(measured by home scales).
Influence of Gender
The first cohort consisted of ten obese (BMI 34.1±1.2 kg/m2) middle-aged (54±4 years) subjects (2 women, 8 men) with high liver fat.
The second cohort consisted of seven obese (BMI 32.1±3.8 kg/m2) middle-aged (47±15 years) subjects (2 women, 5 men) with high
liver fat. All subjects were analyzed as their own control, during and after the diet intervention. Subgroup analysis did not reveal
differences between women and men in their responses of liver fat content during the diet intervention.
METHOD DETAILS
Genotyping of PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 Variants
DNA was extracted from whole blood using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PNPLA3
rs738409 and TM6SF2 rs58542926 variants were genotyped by 5’-nuclease Taqman Assays. Primers and probes (FAM and VIC
labelled) were directly supplied by ThermoFisher Scientific (TaqMan Applied Biosystems, Assay ID: C_7241_10 and
C_89463510_10 for PNPLA3 rs738409 and TM6SF2 rs58542926, respectively). Post-PCR allelic discrimination was performed on
a CFX384 Real-Time System (Bio-Rad) by measuring allele-specific fluorescence. For both variants, genotyping was performed in
triplicate with concordance between replicates and success rate of 100%.
Body Composition, Liver Fat and Liver Volume
Body composition of the first cohort was determined using a Tanita MC-980 MA body composition analyzer at baseline and on day
14. Liver fat and liver volume were assessed by MRS and magnetic resonance imaging (Bian et al., 2014) using a clinical 1.5 imager
(Avantofit, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany). For determination of liver fat content, PRESS localization technique was used to collect
Cell Metabolism 27, 559–571.e1–e5, March 6, 2018
e2
 25325325 mm3 spectra with five different echo times (TE): 30, 50, 80, 135 and 200 ms with 4, 4, 4, 8 and 64 number of averages,
respectively. Acquisition was triggered to end-expiration (TR > 3000 ms). Intensities of water and methylene resonances were
assessed using LCModel v6.3g software. The apparent T2 relaxation times of methylene and water resonances did not change during
the study (Table S1). For each individual experiment, the apparent T2 of water and methylene was determined by monoexponential fit
to five TEs. T2 relaxation effects on intensities were corrected, and liver fat content was calculated as the ratio methylene:
(methylene+water) and further converted to mass fractions as described (Kotronen et al., 2009). Unsaturation indices were
determined from 200 ms spectra using jMRUI v3.0 software (Lundbom et al., 2011).
Measurement of Hepatic DNL
DNL was analyzed as described previously (Diraison et al., 1996). Absolute DNL [i.e., the contribution of DNL to triglycerides within
plasma very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL-TG)] was calculated by multiplying the relative contribution of newly synthesized
palmitate from DNL to VLDL-TG by the concentration of triglycerides in VLDL (Pramfalk et al., 2015). One subject was excluded
from the analysis of DNL for technical reasons.
Lipoproteins and Biochemical Analyses
In the first cohort, lipoprotein fractions were separated as described previously (Taskinen et al., 1988). Serum VLDL from the second
cohort was isolated by ultracentrifugation using deuterium oxide as described previously (Sta
˚ hlman et al., 2008). Plasma concentra-
tions of triglyceride, cholesterol, NEFA, b-hydroxybutyrate, glucose and serum insulin were analyzed using a Konelab 60i analyzer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plasma levels of FGF21, IL-6, TNF-a and apoC-III were measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
USA). Other inflammatory protein biomarkers were analyzed using the Proseek Multiplex Inflammation I96x96 array (Olink Bioscience,
Uppsala, Sweden). Serum folate was measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics USA).
Fecal Genomic DNA and Genome Sequencing
Fecal genomic DNA was extracted from 100 mg of frozen stools from the first cohort using the QIAamp DNA mini stool kit
(Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France) following repeated bead-beating (6500 r.p.m., 3 x 30 s). The DNA was extracted from 48 fecal
samples, obtained from the 10 participants at 5 different time points during the study (2 fecal samples from day 1 were not obtained).
DNA fragments of approximately 300 bp were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 instrument (150 bp; paired-end) at the
Genomics Core Facility, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg.
Metagenomics Analyses
We obtained a total of 151 Gb of raw paired-end reads. The taxonomic and KO composition was obtained by using an updated
version of the MEDUSA pipeline (Karlsson et al., 2014), as described before (Wu et al., 2017). The mean mapping rates for the genome
and gene catalogues were 43.1% and 72.6%, respectively (Table S2). The obtained taxonomic composition and KO profile
matrix were further analyzed by DESeq2 package (Love et al., 2014). Pathway enrichment analyses are based on KEGG annotation
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) and hypergeometric test using goseq (Young et al., 2010). The beta diversity and PCoA analysis were
calculated based on the relative abundance of all significant strains (further transformed by square root to reduce the influence of
dominant KOs as suggested previously (Kindt and Coe, 2005) using phyloseq (version 1.19.1) (McMurdie and Holmes, 2013).
Measurement of Fecal SCFAs and Folate
Fecal SCFAs were measured using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry detection (GC-MS) as described previously
(Wichmann et al., 2013). In brief, approximately 50-250 mg of feces was mixed with internal standards, added to glass vials and
freeze dried. All samples were then acidified with HCl, and SCFAs were extracted with two rounds of diethyl ether extraction. The
organic supernatant was collected, the derivatization agent N-tert-butyldimethylsilyl- N-methyltrifluoroacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich,
Stockholm, Sweden) was added, and samples were incubated overnight. SCFAs were quantified with a 7090A gas chromatograph
coupled to a 5975C mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies 5975C, Santa Clara, CA). SCFA standards were obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich (Stockholm, Sweden).
For folate measurements, approximately 100 mg of fecal sample was transferred to pre-weighed Sarstedt tubes along with six
ceramic beads. 500 mL methanol:water [80:20] containing 20 mM ammonium acetate, 0.1% ascorbic acid and 100 nM of the internal
standard 5-methyl-THF-13C1,d3 (Toronto Research Chemicals, Downsview, ON, Canada) was added and the samples were
homogenized for 10 min at 25 Hz using a TissueLyser instrument (Quiagen Nordic, Copenhagen, Denmark). The samples were
then centrifuged at 20,000g for 10 min and 300 mL of supernatant was transferred to glass vials and evaporated under a stream
of nitrogen. The dried samples were reconstituted in 150 mL of injection solvent (methanol:water [10:90] + 0.1% HCl) and vortexed
for 5 min at 1500 rpm. The sample were added to an OSTRO 96-well plate (Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted under positive pressure
into the 96-well collection plate.
The samples were then injected into a Waters Acquity UPLC system equipped with a Waters BEH Phenyl column (2.1 x 100 mm;
1.7 mm particle size). Column temperature was maintained at 30�C and the flow rate was 400 mL/min. The temperature of the auto
sampler was set at 12�C. The mobile phases consisted of water with 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid
(B). Gradient elution was performed using a linear gradient from 1-15% B over 3 min. The gradient was then increased linearly to
99% B over 4 min. After 0.5 min of isocratic elution the gradient returned to 1% B and held for 2.5 min for a total runtime of 10 min.

 The folates were detected using a Xevo TQ-XS (Waters, Milford, MA) using positive electrospray. Fine tune of the mass spectrom-
eter for each metabolite was performed. After optimization the ion source parameters were: Capillary: 1.00 kV, Desolvation temper-
ature 500�C, Desolvation gas flow 1000 L/h, Cone gas flow 150 L/h, Nebulizer gas flow 7.0 L/h, Cone voltage 20 V, Collision energy 20
eV. For each analyte the most intense precursor/product ion transition was selected. Consequently, the MRM transitions used were:
Folic acid m/z 442.2 / 295.2, 5-methyl-THF m/z 460.2 / 313.2, 5-methyl-THF-13C1,d3 m/z 464.2 / 317.2. Dwell time was 44 ms
for all analytes.
Untargeted Metabolomics Analyses
Untargeted metabolomic profiling of plasma was performed by Metabolon (Durham, NC), as previously described (Lee et al., 2016).
Samples were prepared using the automated MicroLab STAR system from Hamilton Company. A recovery standard was added
before the first step in the extraction process for quality control purposes. Sample preparation was conducted using aqueous meth-
anol extraction process to remove the protein fraction while allowing maximum recovery of small molecules. The resulting extract
was divided into four fractions: one for analysis by UPLC/MS/MS (positive mode), one for UPLC/MS/MS (negative mode), one for
GC/MS, and one for backup. Samples were placed briefly on a TurboVap (Zymark) to remove the organic solvent. Each sample
was then frozen and dried under vacuum. Samples were then prepared for the appropriate instrument (either UPLC/MS/MS or
GC/MS).
Liver Lipid Analysis
Liver biopsies from the second cohort were collected in tubes with RNAlater (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored at -80�C. Lipids
from liver biopsies were extracted as previously described (Lofgren et al., 2016). Lipid extracts were diluted in chloroform:methanol
[1:2] containing 5 mM ammonium acetate and infused into a QTRAP 5500 mass spectrometer (Sciex, Concord, Canada) using a
NanoMate Triversa (Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Phosphatidylcholines and triglycerides were detected in positive mode using
precursor ion scanning and neutral loss scanning as previously described (Brugger et al., 1997; Murphy et al., 2007). Quantification
was made against internal standards added during the extraction.
Transcript Profiling of Liver Biopsies
Total RNA was extracted from the liver biopsies using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions, and used in the subsequent mRNA sample preparation for sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500 systems with the stan-
dard Illumina RNA-seq protocol. The RNAseq was performed at GATC Biotech AG [project number NG-10969] (Konstanz, Germany).
Gene abundance (in both raw counts and transcripts per million) was quantified using the kallisto pipeline (Bray et al., 2016) based
on human genome assembly version GRCh38. The DESeq2 package (Anders and Huber, 2010) was used to identify differentially
expressed genes.
Model Simulation
A previously established genome-scale metabolic model for liver, iHepatocyte2322 (Mardinoglu et al., 2014), was used to investigate
the metabolic shifts in response to the diet. The substrate uptake of the model is constrained partly based on a previous study
(Mardinoglu et al., 2017) and the fluxes are provided in Table S6. To investigate the flux change in response to the diet, both tran-
scriptomic and metabolomic changes were integrated as constraints into the model using a previously developed method, RMetD
(Mardinoglu et al., 2015). The flux distribution was calculated based on the average of 10,000 random sampled fluxes as previously
described (Mardinoglu et al., 2013).
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed in the R environment (R Core Team, 2015). The Wald test or the Likelihood Ratio Test was used
to analyze differential abundances for all count data (for metagenomics and liver transcriptomics) depending on whether the dataset
contains samples collected at two time points or at more than two time points from each individual. One-way ANOVA with repeated
measurements was used for all other longitudinal datasets (for phenomics and metabolomics). Otherwise, two-tailed Wilcoxon
rank–sum tests or Wilcoxon signed–rank tests were used throughout the study, depending on whether the samples were paired.
The linear mixed effect model was built using lme4 package (Bates et al., 2015) in which liver fat adjusted for BMI was entered as
a response variable whereas serum folate adjusted for BMI was entered for fixed effect and individual IDs as random effect. The
model was visualized by visreg (Breheny and Burchett, 2016) and conditional and marginal coefficients of the model were determined
using MuMIn (Barto�
n, 2016). The residual plot and quantile-quantile plot are shown in Figure S6. The multivariate analysis and
integration of phenomics, metagenomics, and metabolomics are based on mixDIABLO (Singh et al., 2016). The Spearman’s
rank–order correlation was used to determine the strength and direction of the monotonic relationships between two variables unless
strong collinearity was observed, in which case the Pearson product-moment correlation was calculated. Raw P values were
adjusted by the Benjamini–Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) with a false discovery rate of 5%, unless indicated
otherwise. Data are shown as mean±s.e.m. unless otherwise indicated.
