Purpose
To assess the prevalence and severity of neurocognitive impairment in adult survivors of pediatric
CNS tumors and to examine associated treatment exposures.
Patients and Methods
Participants included 224 survivors of CNS tumors who were treated at St Jude Children’s Research
Hospital (current median age [range], 26 years [19 to 53 years]; time from diagnosis, 18 years [11 to
42 years]) and completed neurocognitive testing. Information on cranial radiation therapy (CRT)
doses and parameters of delivery were abstracted from medical records. The prevalence of severe
impairment (ie, at least two standard deviations below normative mean) was compared across
radiation treatment groups (no CRT, focal irradiation, craniospinal irradiation) using the x2 test. Log-
binomial models were used to estimate risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% CIs for severe
impairment.
Results
In multivariable models, craniospinal irradiation was associated with a 1.5- to threefold increased risk
of severe impairment compared with no CRT (eg, intelligence: RR = 2.70; 95% CI, 1.37 to 5.34;
memory: RR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.69 to 5.08; executive function: RR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.45).
Seizures were associated with impaired academic performance (RR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.14),
attention (RR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.12 to 2.13), and memory (RR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.99).
Hydrocephalus with shunt placement was associated with impaired intelligence (RR = 1.78; 95% CI,
1.12 to 2.82) and memory (RR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.95). Differential follow-up time contributed
to variability in prevalence estimates between survivors treated with older nonconformal and those
treated with more contemporary conformal radiation therapy methods. Neurocognitive impairment
was significantly associated with lower educational attainment, unemployment, and non-
independent living.
Conclusion
Survivors of pediatric CNS tumors are at risk of severe neurocognitive impairment in adulthood. The
prevalence of severe impairment is greater than expected in the general population, even in the
absence of CRT, and is associated with disrupted attainment of adult social milestones.

INTRODUCTION
The CNS is the site for nearly 20% of tumors
diagnosed in children younger than 20 years of
age, with an age-adjusted incidence rate of 3.1 per
100,000.1 Advances in treatment and supportive
care have increased the 5-year survival from less
than 60% in 1980 to more than 75% today,1 but
late effects of therapy have emerged as a result of
long-term survival.
Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) is an estab-
lished risk factor for neurocognitive impairment
in survivors of pediatric CNS tumors.2-4 Con-
temporary treatment protocols aim to maintain
tumor control or improve overall and progression-
free survival while reducing cognitive morbidities.5
One approach toward this goal, conformal or

 intensity modulated radiation therapy, uses three-dimensional (3D)
imaging to precisely target tumor volume, thereby reducing the
amount of radiation exposure to healthy brain tissue.6 Dose and target
volume reduction has been shown to reduce the risk of cognitive
morbidities in child and adolescent survivors.7-9 To our knowledge,
no studies have reported on long-term neurocognitive outcomes in
adult survivors after conformal radiation treatment.
Because brain development continues into adulthood, the
degree and consequences of neurocognitive impairment may
change during the decades after exposure to CRT. Despite clinical
suggestion of the potential chronicity of neurocognitive morbid-
ities in survivors of childhood CNS tumors, few studies have
directly assessed long-term neurocognitive outcomes in adult
survivors. In the few reports available,10-13 data are limited by
exclusive reliance on survivor self-report of function,11 small
sample sizes (ie, n # 20),10,12 and restriction to homogeneous
survivor groups (eg, medulloblastoma survivors).10,12 Therefore,
the aims of this study were as follows: (1) to assess the prevalence of
neurocognitive impairment in a large cohort of adult survivors of
childhood CNS tumors using direct assessment and patient-
reported outcomes; (2) to examine treatment exposures asso-
ciated with neurocognitive impairment, including examination of
outcomes by radiation delivery parameters; and (3) to report
associations between neurocognitive impairment and adult social
attainment.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Population
The study design and characteristics of the St Jude Lifetime Cohort
(SJLIFE) have been described previously.14,15 Briefly, SJLIFE is a dynamic
cohort with longitudinal follow-up. Survivors are recruited randomly in
blocks of 50. This Institutional Review Board–approved study is designed
to examine the multifactorial cause and severity of long-term effects of
childhood cancer and cancer-directed therapies. Individuals eligible for the
current analysis were treated for childhood CNS tumors at St Jude
Children’s Research Hospital, had a current age $ 18 years, and were $ 10
years from their original childhood cancer diagnosis. We identified 368
potentially eligible CNS tumor survivors as of June 30, 2014. Because
eligibility for a neurocognitive evaluation in SJLIFE is based on the
Children’s Oncology Group Long-term Follow up Guidelines,16,17 survi-
vors who were not treated with neurosurgery and/or cranial irradiation
were ineligible for the current analysis. In addition, survivors with pre-
existing neurologic conditions or injuries unrelated to cancer diagnosis or
treatment were excluded. Of the 343 eligible survivors, 72.9% agreed to
participate, and at the time of the analysis, 224 (65.3%) had completed
neurocognitive evaluations (Fig 1).
Procedures
Participants received comprehensive risk-based clinical and labo-
ratory assessments consistent with the Children’s Oncology Group Long-
term Follow up Guidelines. Medical record abstraction was performed to
determine treatment exposure data, including the need for surgical
resection, hydrocephalus with shunt placement, and seizures. Abstracted
radiation therapy data were reviewed and coded centrally by the St Jude
Children’s Research Hospital Radiation Dosimetry Core blind to func-
tional status. Information on craniospinal irradiation (CSI) dose and focal
or boost dose to the primary tumor site were abstracted through review of
the treatment records and radiation films, and data included the dates
of treatment, prescribed treatment doses, and technical parameters of
delivery. This review yielded five primary treatment groups: (1) neuro-
surgery with or without chemotherapy (no CRT); (2) focal irradiation
using two-dimensional treatment planning (2DRT); (3) focal irradiation
using three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT); (4) CSI
plus focal primary site boost using 2DRT (CSI + 2DRT); and (5) CSI plus
focal primary site boost using 3DCRT (CSI + 3DCRT).
Neurocognitive testing was conducted during a 2-hour session in
dedicated evaluation rooms. The order of testing was standardized to
minimize the effects of interference and fatigue. Assessed domains (and
instruments) included intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intel-
ligence18), academics (Woodcock Johnson Tests of Achievement-III: Basic
Reading and Math Calculation19), memory (California Verbal Learning
Test-II: Total Learning, Short-Delay Free Recall and Long-Delay Free
Recall20), attention (Trail Making Test Part A21; Conners’ Continuous
Performance Test-II Omissions and Variability22; Digit Span Forward
subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III [WAIS-III]18), pro-
cessing speed (Coding and Symbol Search subtests of the WAIS-III18;
Continuous Performance Test-II Hit Rate22), fine motor dexterity
(Grooved Pegboard21), and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B21;
Controlled Oral Word Association Test21; Digit Span Backward subtest of
the WAIS-III18). Survivors also self-reported symptoms of executive
dysfunction (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function23). Each
test yields standard scores (age-adjusted means and standard deviations)
using test-specific standardization norms. Adult social attainment was
measured on the basis of educational attainment, current employment
status, and independent living. These questions and response formats
parallel those used in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study.24,25
Data Analysis
We estimated overall and stratified (by radiation exposure: no CRT,
focal irradiation, and CSI) means with standard deviations or medians
with ranges, as appropriate. Frequency distributions of categorical vari-
ables were compared among treatment groups using the x2 test, and
continuous variables were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way
analysis of variance test. P ,.05 suggested statistical differences in variable
distributions between groups. On the basis of age-adjusted norms, we
estimated the percent of survivors with severe neurocognitive or behavioral
impairments in each subdomain (ie, age-adjusted z score # 22.0). Age-
standardized morbidity ratios (MRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were

Adult Neurocognitive Outcomes of Pediatric CNS Tumors
 used to compare the observed prevalence of severe neurocognitive and
behavioral impairments among survivors with the expected prevalence of
severe impairments in the general population (ie, on the basis of age-
specific population norms). In addition, we used log-binomial models to
estimate risk ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% CIs among survivors for
associations between exposures and severe neurocognitive or behavioral
impairments. Covariate selection was informed using the Akaike infor-
mation criterion (AIC), where the AIC did not differ significantly from the
optimal AIC, and a priori selected exposures of interest (eg, age, sex, cranial
irradiation exposure, shunt placement, and seizures). We used Poisson
regression to estimate rate ratios and corresponding 95% CIs for the
associations between two-dimensional (2D) and 3D treatment eras,
separately for those treated with or without CSI, and for severe neuro-
cognitive impairment after adjustment for age at neurocognitive assess-
ment, sex, and race. Finally, given the short follow-up duration for the 3D
treatment groups compared with that of the 2D groups, we explored the
sensitivity of rate ratio estimates to additional follow-up for the effect of
3D treatment by adding 5-year increments of additional follow-up to the
3D groups to more closely simulate the follow-up distribution of the 2D
groups and reestimated the rate ratios. Given that all analyses were based
on a priori hypotheses, the results were not adjusted for multiple
comparisons.26,27 Analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC), R (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria), and STATA (STATA, College
Station, TX).
RESULTS
Survivor Characteristics
A modestly larger proportion of participants than non-
participants received chemotherapy
and cranial irradiation,
underwent surgical resection, had seizures, and had infratentorial
disease, although these differences were not statistically significant.
The distribution of primary cancer diagnosis differed between
participants and nonparticipants (P = .02; Appendix Table A1,
online only). The median age of survivors in our sample was 26
years (range, 19 to 53 years) and they were 18 years from primary
diagnosis (range, 11 to 42 years). Thirty-three percent of survivors
were treated with focal irradiation, 38% with CSI, and 29% did not
receive CRT. The distribution of age at diagnosis (P = .02), sex (P =
.04), tumor location (P ,.001), surgical resection (P ,.001), shunt
placement (P = .02), and seizures (P = .006) varied significantly by
CRT exposure (Table 1).
Neurocognitive Functioning
In the overall sample, the prevalence of severe neurocognitive
impairment ranged from 8% (95% CI, 4.4 to 11.8) on direct
assessment of working memory to 57% (95% CI, 50.0 to 63.6) on a
task of fine motor dexterity (Fig 2; Appendix Table A2). On the
basis of the general population, the expected prevalence of severe
impairment was 2%, but 20% to 30% of survivors demonstrated
such impairment on performance-based measures of intellect,
short- and long-term memory, mathematics, and cognitive flu-
ency. In contrast, on self-report measures, less than 10% of sur-
vivors reported a significant adverse impact of cognitive skills on
daily functioning, with the exception of working memory (21%;
95% CI, 16.0 to 26.8). The prevalence of severe impairment across
cognitive domains and specific abilities varied by radiation
exposure (Table 2; Fig 2). For example, 11% (MR, 5.6; 95% CI, 2.5
to 11.2) of survivors without CRT exposure were impaired on
long-term memory compared with 25% (MR, 12.7; 95% CI, 7.7
to 16.5) exposed to focal irradiation and 36% (MR, 18.1; 95%
CI, 12.4 to 25.7) exposed to CSI (P , .001).
In multivariable models, older age at diagnosis was inversely
associated with severe neurocognitive impairment across all
domains (Table 3). Treatment with CSI conferred the greatest risk
of severe neurocognitive impairment (eg, intelligence: RR = 2.70;
95% CI, 1.37 to 5.34; academics: RR = 3.96; 95% CI, 1.94 to 8.08;
memory: RR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.69 to 5.08; executive function: RR =
1.74; 95% CI, 1.24 to 2.45) compared with survivors who were not
treated with CRT. Seizures were associated with impaired aca-
demics (RR = 1.48; 95% CI, 1.02 to 2.14), attention (RR = 1.54;
95% CI, 1.12 to 2.13), and memory (RR = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.04 to
1.99). History of hydrocephalus with shunt placement was asso-
ciated with increased risk of impaired intelligence (RR = 1.78; 95%
CI, 1.12 to 2.82) and memory (RR = 1.42; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.95).
Multivariable models including tumor location are shown in
Appendix Table A3. The inclusion of product terms in our
multivariable regression models did not suggest significant
interaction with the identified risk factors.
Given the small number of observations, the type of radiation
therapy (ie, 2DRT v 3DCRT) could not be considered in multi-
variable models. Nevertheless, we examined performance on direct
assessment measures by 2DRT and 3DCRT within CSI and focal
irradiation groups (Appendix Table A4). A lower prevalence of
impairment was observed across nearly all domains for survivors
treated with CSI plus 3DCRT compared with those treated with
CSI plus 2DRT, as well as for those treated with focal 3DCRT
compared with those treated with focal 2DRT (Fig 3; Appendix
Table A5). However, comparisons are limited given the difference
in follow-up time between survivors treated with 2D and 3D
techniques. Survivors treated with 3DCRT had, on average, 14
years of follow-up, whereas survivors treated with 2DRT were
followed for 21 years. Rate ratios accounting for differences in
follow-up time with adjustment for age at assessment, sex, and
race suggest elevated rates of severe impairment in survivors
treated with 3D compared with 2D radiation therapy, but were
not statistically significant (Appendix Tables A6 and A7).
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the potential
impact of shorter follow-up times for the 3D groups compared
with the 2D groups. For example, assuming no additional
individuals with executive function impairment were identified in
the CSI + 2DRT group, an additional 5 years of follow-up time for
the CSI + 3DCRT group would result in a similar rate of executive
function impairment for the 3D and 2D groups (rate ratio =
0.99). With the addition of 10 years of follow-up time, survivors
treated with CSI + 3DCRT had a 29% reduction in the rate of
severe impairment compared with those treated with CSI + 2DRT
(rate ratio = 0.71). Similar patterns were observed with the
addition of 5 and 10 years of follow-up time for 3DCRT com-
pared with 2DRT.
Social Attainment
In multivariable models adjusted for current age and sex,
neurocognitive impairment was associated with increased risk of
reduced
educational

independent living. For example, survivors with impaired intellect

Adult Neurocognitive Outcomes of Pediatric CNS Tumors
 (RR = 1.37; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.52), academics (RR = 1.41; 95% CI,
1.26 to 1.57), or executive function (RR=1.41; 95% CI, 1.20 to
1.66), had a 40% increased risk of not graduating from college. The
risk of unemployment was two times greater in survivors with
impaired attention (RR = 2.37; 95% CI, 1.75 to 3.21), memory (RR
= 1.87; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.47), or executive function (RR = 2.17;
95% CI, 1.54 to 3.07). Survivors with severe impairment in
intelligence (RR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.76), academics (RR =
1.55; 95% CI, 1.29 to 1.86), memory (RR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.23 to
1.80) or executive function (RR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.18 to 1.83) had
an approximately 50% increased risk of nonindependent living
compared with survivors without such impairment.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this report presents the most comprehensive
analysis of outcome data on a large cohort of adult survivors of
pediatric CNS tumors, with direct assessment of neurocognitive
function and the resulting impact on social attainment. Nearly 20
years after diagnosis, survivors demonstrated severe impairment of
up to 15 times the frequency of that observed in the general
population. Our results contribute several novel and important
findings to the literature: (1) the prevalence of severe impairment is
significantly greater than that observed in the general population,
even among survivors who were not treated with CRT; (2) directly
assessed neurocognitive skills are more severely impaired com-
pared with self-reported cognition and behavior; (3) the risk of
severe neurocognitive impairment in adulthood is increased sig-
nificantly by a history of seizures and hydrocephalus with shunt
placement; (4) the potential long-term benefit of conformal
radiation therapy is yet to be established in adult survivors,
although our results suggest that such benefit may be observed
with additional follow-up time; and, (5) neurocognitive im-
pairment is associated with reduced attainment of adult devel-
opmental milestones.
The frequency of severe neurocognitive impairment was greater
than expected across all domains of neurocognitive function. Even
among survivors who were not treated with CRT, we observed a
fivefold increased prevalence of impairment on measures of short-
and long-term memory and a 17-fold increased prevalence of
impaired cognitive flexibility. Moreover, 37% of survivors without
CRT exposure were severely impaired on at least one measure of
processing speed, a cognitive domain often presumed to be affected
by radiation-induced changes to cerebral white matter.
Although a larger than expected proportion of survivors
demonstrated severe neurocognitive impairment, few perceived a
similar degree of impairment in daily life. With the exception of
working memory, less than 10% of survivors reported severe
cognitive or behavioral impairment, whereas up to 50% of sur-
vivors were severely impaired on performance-based measures.
This contrast may be a result of survivor adaptation to deficits
over time. Survivors may learn to compensate for their deficits
or to avoid situations that require specific skills, thereby
reducing the potential impact on daily activities. Alternatively,
survivors may lack the insight or awareness to appreciate the
impact of their deficits. Our results highlight the need to
consider clinical measurement and patient-reported outcomes
when assessing neurocognitive function in this population.
Consistent with prior studies among child and adolescent
survivors, CSI was significantly associated with severe impair-
ment across all neurocognitive domains. However, observed
associations were not restricted to radiation therapy exposure. We
also observed that survivors with a history of seizures were at risk
of severely impaired academics, attention, and memory com-
pared with survivors without a history of seizures. Seizures
conferred a nearly 50% increased risk of impairment even after
adjustment for exposure to CRT. In adults with epilepsy, deficits
in memory and attention are well documented.28,29 The impact of
seizures on neurocognitive function may be related to structural
brain abnormalities and/or the cumulative neurobiologic con-
sequences of recurrent seizures. However, because of the small
number of survivors with seizures, we were unable to examine the
contribution of seizure status (resolved v unresolved) or the use
anticonvulsant medications, which have previously been asso-
ciated with neurocognitive morbidities in adult survivors of
childhood cancer.30 A history of hydrocephalus with shunt
placement conferred a 40% increased risk of memory impair-
ment, consistent with the literature documenting hippocampal
vulnerability to hydrocephalus.31
Our results also provide important information regarding the
functional implications of neurocognitive impairment. Specifically,
severe neurocognitive impairment was associated with a reduced
attainment of expected adult developmental milestones, including

NOTE. Data are presented as median (range) or No. (%). Two hundred twenty-four survivors participated in the study. Seven survivors were treated with brachytherapy
or received reirradiation and were not included in subgroup analyses using cranial radiation data. Therefore, 217 participants were included in the three treatment groups:
no CRT, focal irradiation, and CSI. Cumulative dose to the tumor bed is composed of the craniospinal dose or focal irradiation dose plus the boost dose delivered
specifically to the tumor bed. Tumor bed boost dose includes only the additional boost dose of radiotherapy targeting the primary tumor bed. P values were calculated
using Kruskal-Wallis one way analysis of variance test comparing medians for three groups or x2 test comparing proportions across three groups.

Adult Neurocognitive Outcomes of Pediatric CNS Tumors
 education, employment, and independent living. These findings
are consistent with reports from other childhood cancer
survivors32 and reports linking self-report of cognitive impair-
ment with lower socioeconomic attainment among CNS tumor
survivors.11
A unique contribution of our study is the assessment of
potential differences in neurocognitive outcomes by parameters of
CRT delivery, particularly 2D compared with 3D techniques. Data
from survivors within 5 years of diagnosis and treatment suggest
that radiation dose and volume reduction may confer benefit with
respect to the established cognitive decline observed in the first
decade after treatment completion. Our results are not compatible
with the hypothesized benefit of 3DCRT therapy on long-term
cognitive outcomes; however, the studied cohort was treated in the
early stages of conformal treatment planning when the chosen
clinical target volume margins were conservative and large,
resulting in a modest level of normal tissue sparing. In addition, the
duration of follow-up is markedly different between survivors
treated with older 2DRT and those treated with more con-
temporary 3DCRT techniques. Neurocognitive assessments were
completed later among survivors treated with 2DRT; the con-
sequence is that the time to impairment may have been over-
estimated for survivors treated with 2DRT. We used sensitivity
analysis to explore the potential impact of follow-up duration on
our effect estimates comparing 2DRT and 3DCRT groups. The
results suggested that the risk of severe cognitive impairment may
be lower after 3DCRT than after 2DRT techniques with 5 to 10
years of additional follow-up for survivors treated with 3D
techniques. These results emphasize the need for systematic
follow-up of survivors beyond 5 years after therapy, with appro-
priate assessment and comparison of long-term outcomes as
treatment protocols change.
Other limitations should be considered when interpreting
our findings. Survivors who returned to campus and partici-
pated in a neurocognitive evaluation may have differed with
respect to health or neurocognitive status compared with

 survivors who did not participate. Although comparisons of
participants and nonparticipants in our study and the SJLIFE
cohort as a whole do not suggest selective participation, the
missing outcomes for nonparticipants precludes certainty about
a lack of bias from selective participation. Because concern
regarding selection bias cannot be eliminated, generalization of
our results to other samples may be limited. In addition,
although our exposure and outcome measurements are com-
patible with a temporal order between CRT exposure and
neurocognitive morbidities, the lack of serial neurocognitive
assessments precludes inferences about potential cognitive
decline associated with aging in survivors.
Our results suggest that adult survivors of pediatric brain
tumors are at risk of pervasive neurocognitive impairment several
decades after diagnosis and treatment. Survivors may adapt to or
lack insight related to their deficits, but observed cognitive dif-
ficulties confer a risk of reduced socioeconomic attainment in
adulthood. Systematic monitoring of cognitive functioning of
survivors is recommended. Prophylactic interventions during
therapy,33,34 as well as remedial approaches,35,36 may reduce the
severity and functional impact of neurocognitive impairment in
survivors of pediatric brain tumors.
