IMPORTANCE Although sparse observational studies have suggested a link between migraine
and cervical artery dissection (CEAD), any association between the 2 disorders is still
unconfirmed. This lack of a definitive conclusion might have implications in understanding
the pathogenesis of both conditions and the complex relationship between migraine and
ischemic stroke (IS).
OBJECTIVE To investigate whether a history of migraine and its subtypes is associated with
the occurrence of CEAD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective cohort study of consecutive patients
aged 18 to 45 years with first-ever acute ischemic stroke enrolled in the multicenter Italian
Project on Stroke in Young Adults was conducted between January 1, 2000, and June 30,
2015. In a case-control design, the study assessed whether the frequency of migraine and its
subtypes (presence or absence of an aura) differs between patients whose IS was due to
CEAD (CEAD IS) and those whose IS was due to a cause other than CEAD (non-CEAD IS) and
compared the characteristics of patients with CEAD IS with and without migraine.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of migraine and its subtypes in patients with
CEAD IS vs non-CEAD IS.
RESULTS Of the 2485 patients (mean [SD] age, 36.8 [7.1] years; women, 1163 [46.8%])
included in the registry, 334 (13.4%) had CEAD IS and 2151 (86.6%) had non-CEAD IS.
Migraine was more common in the CEAD IS group (103 [30.8%] vs 525 [24.4%], P = .01), and
the difference was mainly due to migraine without aura (80 [24.0%] vs 335 [15.6%],
P < .001). Compared with migraine with aura, migraine without aura was independently
associated with CEAD IS (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.30-2.33). The strength of this association was
higher in men (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31-3.04) and in patients 39.0 years or younger (OR, 1.82;
95% CI, 1.22-2.71). The risk factor profile was similar in migrainous and non-migrainous
patients with CEAD IS (eg, hypertension, 20 [19.4%] vs 57 [24.7%], P = .29; diabetes, 1 [1.0%]
vs 3 [1.3%], P > .99).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In patients with IS aged 18 to 45 years, migraine, especially
migraine without aura, is consistently associated with CEAD. This finding suggests common
features and warrants further analyses to elucidate the underlying biologic mechanisms.

A
lthough spontaneous cervical artery dissection (CEAD)
is the most frequent cause of ischemic stroke (IS) in
young and middle-aged adults, the mechanisms lead-
ing to vessel damage are still unclear.1 A reason for this lack of
clarity is the limited number of large epidemiologic studies
aimedatinvestigatingthisunusualdiseasethathavebeencon-
ducted thus far. In particular, what is poorly defined is the ef-
fect that specific susceptibility factors might have on disease
risk. This is especially true for migraine. Scarce reports, mainly
derived from case series and case-control studies conducted
on small cohorts, have observed a higher prevalence of mi-
graine in patients with spontaneous CEAD compared with pa-
tients with an IS due to a cause other than CEAD (non-CEAD
IS).2 To our knowledge, the international Cervical Artery Dis-
section and Ischemic Stroke Patients (CADISP) case-control
study3 is the only study confirming these findings in a large
cohort and providing support for the idea that such an asso-
ciation may vary according to migraine subtype, being stron-
ger for migraine without aura. Apart from the contribution that
these findings might have for better understanding the biol-
ogy of arterial dissection, they also might have potential im-
plications in elucidating the specific pathways underlying the
widely accepted association between migraine and IS in young
adults. In this regard, any association between this primary
headache and spontaneous CEAD deserves to be further sub-
stantiated, and the characteristics of migrainous patients with
IScausedbyCEADshouldbebetterdefined.Weaimedtoevalu-
ate the association between migraine and spontaneous CEAD,
as well as the effect of specific migraine subtypes on disease
risk, in the Italian Project on Stroke at Young Age (IPSYS), one
of the largest registries of patients with early-onset IS that is
currently available.
Methods
Study Design and Patients Selection
The IPSYS is a countrywide network of neurologic centers with
a special interest in cerebral ischemia occurring at a young age
across Italy, aimed at recruiting white patients with first-ever
acutestrokewhofulfillthefollowingcriteria:(1)age18to45years
and (2) computed tomographic (CT)– or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI)–proven cerebral infarction in the setting of a
hospital-based,multicenter,observationalstudy.Centersarein-

present analysis, we screened data sets from patients consecu-
tivelyadmittedto26hospitals.TherecruitmentperiodwasJanu-
ary1,2000,throughJune30,2015.Strokewasdefinedasasud-
den loss of global or focal cerebral function that persisted for
more than 24 hours with a probable vascular cause. Ischemic
stroke due to sinus venous thrombosis, vasospasm after sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage, and cardiac surgery; IS occurring as an
immediateconsequenceoftrauma;andiatrogenicstrokeswere
excluded.4,5 All aspects of the study were approved by relevant
local authorities at each study site (eAppendix 2 in the Supple-
ment).Writteninformedconsentwasobtainedfromallpatients
or their guardians.
Risk Factor Definition
Thefollowingriskfactorsforprematurecerebralischemiawere
documented: hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoking, hy-
percholesterolemia, and migraine. These variables were de-
fined and dichotomized as follows: hypertension, with sys-

Assessment of Migraine History
The personal history of headache was assessed in all patients
by study physicians (all but M. Grassi, L.I., and A. Padovani)
duringaface-to-faceinterviewinboththeacute-phaseandfol-
low-up evaluations. A history of migraine before stroke oc-
currence was considered for the present analysis. The diag-
noses of migraine without aura and migraine with aura were
made according to the diagnostic criteria of the International
Headache Society.6,7
Clinical and Laboratory Investigations
All patients underwent an etiologic workup, including com-
plete blood cell count; biochemical profile; urinalysis; 12-
lead electrocardiogram; chest radiography; Doppler ultraso-
nography, with frequency spectral analysis and B-mode
echotomography of the cervical arteries; transcranial Dop-
pler ultrasonography; and CT and/or MR angiography, to in-

raphy were performed to rule out cardiac sources of emboli.
Key Points
Question Is there a link between migraine and cervical artery
dissection?
Findings In this cohort study of 2485 patients aged 18 to 45 years
with first-ever acute ischemic stroke, a history of migraine,
especially the subtype without aura, was independently
associated with cervical artery dissection. The strength of this
association was higher in men and in younger individuals.
Meaning In young patients with ischemic stroke, migraine is
consistently associated with cervical artery dissection. This finding
implicates possible common biologic mechanisms underlying the 2
disorders.

In particular, the presence of patent foramen ovale (PFO) was
assessed in all patients with transesophageal echocardiogra-
phy with a contrast study and Valsalva maneuver or transcra-
nial Doppler sonography with intravenous injection of agi-
tated saline (contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler),
according to validated protocols.4,5
Diagnosis of CEAD
Four-vessel conventional angiography, MRI with MR angiog-
raphy (3-dimensional time of flight), and/or CT angiography
of the brain and neck were included in the diagnostic workup.
The presence of the double-lumen sign (a false lumen or an
intimal flap), luminal narrowing with the “string sign,” and
gradual tapering ending in total occlusion of the lumen (flame-
like occlusion) were considered reliable angiographic find-
ings of CEAD, whereas a narrowed lumen surrounded by a
semilunar-shaped intramural hematoma on axial T1-
weighted images was considered the pathognomonic MRI
sign.8
Definition of Traumatic CEAD
We considered the mechanisms of trauma associated with
CEAD to be (1) any direct mechanical impact to the neck re-
gion, (2) any impact to the head with indirect involvement of
the neck region, or (3) any mechanical activity causing greatly
increased intrathoracic pressure (eg, heavy lifting) that had oc-
curred within 1 month before the first symptoms of dissec-
tion. Traumatic events leading to medical examination or hos-
pitalization were considered major, and all other events were
consideredminor.9Dissectionsoccurringasanimmediatecon-
sequence of a major trauma were excluded.
For the purpose of the present analysis, patients in-
cluded in the registry were dichotomized into 2 groups: IS due
to spontaneous CEAD (CEAD IS) and IS due to a cause other
than CEAD (non-CEAD IS). Patients with non-CEAD IS were
classifiedintoetiologicsubgroupsaccordingtotheTOAST(Trial
of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria.10
Statistical Analysis
Differences between the 2 subgroups (CEAD IS and non-
CEAD IS) were examined with the χ2 test, an unpaired, 2-tailed
t test, and the Mann-Whitney test, when appropriate. A cat-
egorical (multinomial) logistic regression model was planned
to examine the conditional effects of hypertension, diabetes,
smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and history of migraine and
its subtypes (migraine without aura and migraine with aura)
in the prediction of each subgroup, and was adjusted for age
and sex. To evaluate whether the magnitude of migraine ef-
fectmayvaryaccordingtosexandage,weconductedthesame
analysis separately for men and women and for 2 different
strata defined by median age. We additionally investigated
whether, within the subgroup of patients with CEAD (case-
only analysis), the vascular risk factor profile differed be-
tween patients with migraine and patients without migraine.
Finally, because of the suggested association between PFO and
migraine,11 we conducted subgroup analyses based on the in-
dividual status of carrier or noncarrier of this cardiac inter-
atrial septal abnormality. Results are given as odds ratios (ORs)
with 95% CIs. P ≤ .05 determined with a 2-sided test was con-
sideredsignificant.DatawereanalyzedusingSPSS,version16.0
(http://www.spss.com).
Results
The present study targeted 2485 patients enrolled in the
IPSYS registry. Among these, 334 patients (13.4%) had a diag-
nosis of CEAD IS and 2151 individuals (86.6%) had a diagno-
sis of non-CEAD IS. The mean (SD) age of the patients was
36.8 (7.1) years, and 1163 participants (46.8%) were women.
As expected, patients with non-CEAD IS were more likely to
have an unfavorable cardiovascular risk factor profile,
including diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and current
smoking status. Migraine was more common in the sub-
group of patients with CEAD IS (103 [30.8%] vs 525 [24.4%],
P = .01). This was mainly due to difference in the frequency
of migraine without aura (80 [24.0%] vs 335 [15.6%],
P < .001), while the frequency of migraine with aura did not
differ significantly in the 2 subgroups (21 [6.3%] vs 190
[8.8%], P = .12). The demographic characteristics of the
study population grouped according to disease status and
the prevalence of selected risk factors are presented in
Table 1.
After adjustment for the preselected variables, migraine
without aura was significantly associated with the subgroup
of CEAD IS (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.30-2.33), but we did not detect
any significant association between migraine with aura and
CEAD IS (OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.49-1.29). Conversely, there was
a significant association with diabetes (OR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.38-
11.11), current smoking (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.07-1.78), and hy-
percholesterolemia (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.03-1.88) with non-
CEAD IS. A personal history of migraine was significantly
associated with the subgroup of CEAD IS only in men. Simi-
larly, although migraine without aura was associated with dis-
section in both sexes and it was independent of the patients’
age, the magnitude of this association was higher in men than
in women (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.31-3.04 vs OR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.04-
2.25) and in the subgroup of younger compared with older pa-
tients (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.22-2.71 vs OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.04-
2.31) (Table 2).
Finally, in the case-only analysis restricted to patients with
CEAD IS, we observed an increased prevalence of women with
migraine compared with men with migraine, with or without
aura (62 [60.2%] vs 41 [39.8%], P ≤ .001), but did not find sig-
nificant differences in the vascular risk factor profile be-
tween patients with and without migraine (Table 3).
The status of PFO carrier had no apparent influence on our
findings. Although the prevalence of migraine, especially with
aura, was higher in patients with PFO compared with those
without PFO (any migraine, 239 [30.3%] vs 389 [22.9%],
P < .001; migraine without aura, 129 [16.3%] vs 286 [16.9%];
P = .74;migrainewithaura,110[13.9%]vs101[6.0%],P < .001),
the exclusion of PFO carriers from the analysis (763 non-
CEAD IS and 26 CEAD IS) did not modify the association be-
tween migraine categories, especially migraine without aura,
and CEAD (any migraine, 89 [28.9%] vs 300 [21.6%], P = .006;

vides further support for our observations.
Discussion
In this large cohort study of patients with IS aged 18 to 45 years,
we found a consistent association between migraine and spon-
taneous CEAD. This association persisted after adjustment for
traditional vascular risk factors, and it was apparent for the mi-
graine subtype without aura more than for migraine with aura,
for men more than for women, and for the younger rather than
olderagegroup.Wealsofoundnosignificantdifferencesinrisk
factorprofilebetweenpatientswithCEADISwithmigraineand
those without migraine, despite an expected preponderance
of women among migraineurs.
Comparison With Other Studies
Most studies evaluating the association between migraine and
spontaneous CEAD have been limited to small cohorts, some
of which, but not all,12,13 provided evidence of association. A
pooled meta-analysis of these data suggested that a history of
migraine increases the risk of spontaneous CEAD by 2-fold.2
As stated by the authors, despite this evidence, the results of
the meta-analysis leave some remaining uncertainties. In par-
ticular, there are inconsistencies regarding the potential modi-
fying effects of migraine aura status and sex, because of the
low number of migraineurs with aura in individual studies, the
small proportion of studies with sex-stratified data available,

and differences among the control groups, including IS con-
trols in some studies and healthy participants in others. The
results of our analysis are in line with those recently derived
from the CADISP registry, the largest cohort study of patients
with CEAD.3 In that study, as in ours, migraine was associ-
ated with a higher risk of CEAD than of non-CEAD IS, and this
risk was especially evident for the migraine subtype without
aura. At variance with that study, we observed an age-
dependentassociationbetweenmigraineandCEAD,whichwas
stronger in the subgroup of the youngest patients.
Potential Biological Mechanisms
The mechanisms by which migraine might increase the indi-
vidualpropensitytoCEADremainunproven,buttherearecon-
vincing arguments for common biological pathways underly-
ing the 2 disorders. Among these, shared genetic susceptibility
and endothelial dysfunction seem to be plausible. The recent
genome-wide association study of CEAD conducted by the
CADISP consortium found a strong association between a ge-
netic variant in the PHACTR1 gene located on chromosome 6
and spontaneous CEAD.14 The same protective allele had also
beenpreviouslyidentifiedbyagenome-wideassociationstudy
to be associated with a reduced risk of migraine.15 Additional
suggestivegeneticrisklociforCEAD,includingLRP1andFHL5,
have also been associated with migraine.16 Finally, sparse re-
ports indicate that the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)
pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of migraine and
CEAD. This hypothesis is indirectly supported by the obser-
vation of increased cerebrospinal fluid17 or plasma18 levels of
TGF-β1 in migraineurs and by the identification of a locus near
TGFBR2 in a large genome-wide association study,15 which im-
plicates a biological role in migraine. The well-known involve-
ment of TGF-β in Marfan syndrome or in Loeys-Dietz syn-
drome, 2 autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorders
characterized by large artery anomalies,19,20 also provides evi-
dence for a role of this biological pathway in the occurrence
of arterial dissection. Finally, endothelial dysfunction, that is,
a reduction in vasodilator activities, increase in endothelial-
derived vasoconstrictors, and consequent impairment of the
vascular reactivity, has been consistently documented in the
2 conditions. A genetic predisposition to the impaired endo-
thelium-dependent vasodilatation observed in patients with
CEAD and in those with migraine21,22 cannot be excluded, sug-
gesting that there could be a common generalized vascular dis-
order related to both entities. Conversely, in line with the re-
sults from the CADISP consortium, the possibility that people
with migraine have an increased propensity to develop CEAD
because of a nonfavorable vascular risk factor profile seems
unlikely, based on our findings.
Strengths and Limitations
Our study has several strengths, including the prospective de-
sign, large number of participants, standardized evaluation of
vascular disease risk factors, confirmation of migraine diag-
nosis by neurologists in all centers, and homogeneous demo-
graphic characteristics and clinical phenotype of the cohort,
which may reduce confounding. Moreover, the fact that all of
the patients enrolled in the IPSYS registry underwent a stan-
dard workup for early-onset stroke, including MR angiogra-
phyinvestigation,reducesthepossibilitythatsomeCEADcases
remained unrecognized in our series. This possibility is ex-
pectedtobemorelikelyinstudiesincludingpatientswithCEAD
with no ischemic symptoms.23 Several limitations also should
be considered when interpreting our findings. First, because
the IPSYS is a hospital-based study, the results might be sus-
ceptible to hospital referral selection bias. However, inaccu-
rate capture of the incident cases is highly unlikely, because
young patients with stroke are usually referred to academic
centers during the course of the disease. Second, because we
did not assess migraine frequency and severity or the fre-
quency of auras, we cannot evaluate whether the observed as-
sociation differs according to specific migraine patterns. Simi-
larly, no information on the use of migraine-specific
medications was available. However, whether migraine fre-
quency is a measure of migraine severity remains to be dem-
onstrated, and there is no evidence of a direct effect of mi-
graine-specific drugs on vessel wall integrity. Third, at least
theoretically, we cannot exclude the possibility that differ-

ences in group sizes might have introduced bias into the analy-
sis of data. Fourth, since participants in this study were aged
18 to 45 years and white, with a documented acute cerebral
infarct, generalizability to other populations might be lim-
ited. Finally, residual confounding cannot be definitively ruled
out, as our data are observational.
Implications of Findings
The results of our study support the findings of other case-
control studies2 linking migraine with an increased risk of
CEAD. At variance with most epidemiologic studies that
found an association between the migraine subtype with
aura and an increased risk of IS at a young age, our findings,
as well as those of others, point toward the apparently para-
doxical conclusion that, at least for CEAD, the most frequent
cause of early-onset brain ischemia, this risk is mainly
driven by the migraine subtype without aura. However, for
complex diseases, such as migraine, identification of the
phenotype is challenging due to the lack of objective mark-
ers and uncertainty about the cause of the disease. Further-
more, as the recent large genetic studies on migraine have
suggested, the phenotypes commonly used (migraine with-
out aura and migraine with aura) are probably not the most
adequate to capture the heterogeneity of the many disease
subtypes.24
Conclusions
Our data support consideration of a history of migraine as a
marker for increased risk of IS caused by CEAD, as well as a pu-
tative susceptibility factor for CEAD, regardless of its clinical
features. This finding emphasizes the need for further analy-
ses to investigate the nature and mechanisms of elevated risk
