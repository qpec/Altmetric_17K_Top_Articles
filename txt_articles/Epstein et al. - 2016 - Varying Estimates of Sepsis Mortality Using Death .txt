Varying Estimates of Sepsis Mortality Using Death Certificates and 
Administrative Codes — United States, 1999–2014

the largest all-payer, publicly-available inpatient database in the 
United States, using various combinations of the International 
Classification of Diseases 9th Revision Clinical Modification 
(ICD-9-CM) administrative codes for primary or secondary 
infection and organ dysfunction to identify severe sepsis.
In a published report (2), investigators generated a range 
of sepsis mortality estimates using four previously established 
approaches to identifying adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with 
sepsis using administrative claims data. Two of these approaches 
(4,5) defined sepsis using explicit, sepsis-specific ICD-9-CM 
codes in addition to various codes for infection and organ 
dysfunction, whereas the other two approaches (6,7) defined 
sepsis on the basis of combinations of infection criteria and 
organ dysfunction as implicit markers for severe sepsis.
Multiple cause-of-death mortality files maintained in the 
CDC WONDER database were reviewed to analyze deaths 
(for all ages) from sepsis reported on death certificates during 
1999–2014, defined as deaths with diagnoses correspond-
ing to International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision 
(ICD-10) diagnosis codes A40 (streptococcal septicemia) and 
A41 (other septicemia) listed on the death certificate. The 
annual sepsis mortality estimates based on death certificates 
from the WONDER database were then compared with the 
previously published annual estimates generated based on the 
ICD-9-CM administrative codes data from the Nationwide 
Inpatient Sample.
Based on multiple cause-of-death data during 1999–2014, 
a total of 2,470,666 decedents (6% of all deaths) had sepsis 
listed among the causes of death (sepsis-related deaths); for 
22% of these decedents, sepsis was listed as the underlying 
cause of death. During this period, the annual number of all 
reported sepsis-related deaths increased 31%, from 139,086 in 
1999 to 182,242 in 2014 (Figure 1). Approximately 15% of all 
sepsis-related deaths during this period occurred in nonacute 
care settings (e.g., at home, long-term care facilities, hospice, 
and unknown setting). Among the 2,472,911 A40 and A41 
codes listed for the 2,470,666 decedents, the most common 
were unspecified septicemia (A41.9, 94%), septicemia caused 
by other gram-negative organisms (A41.5, 2%), and septi-
cemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus (A41.0, 2%). Among 
decedents, approximately 49% were aged 65–84 years, 26% 
were aged ≥85 years, and 25% were aged 25–64 years (4% aged 
Sepsis is a clinical syndrome caused by a dysregulated host 
response to infection (1). Because there is no confirmatory 
diagnostic test, the diagnosis of sepsis is based on evidence of 
infection and clinical judgement. Both death certificates and 
health services utilization data (administrative claims) have 
been used to assess sepsis incidence and mortality, but estimates 
vary depending on the surveillance definition and data source. 
To highlight the challenges and variability associated with 
estimating sepsis mortality, CDC compared national estimates 
of sepsis-related mortality based on death certificates using the 
CDC WONDER database with published sepsis mortality 
estimates generated using administrative claims data from hos-
pital discharges reported in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, 
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Agency for Healthcare 
Research and Quality (2). During 2004–2009, using data 
rounded to thousands, the annual range of published sepsis-
related mortality estimates based on administrative claims 
data was 15% to 140% higher (range = 168,000–381,000) 
than annual estimates generated using death certificate data 
(multiple causes) (range = 146,000–159,000). Differences in 
sepsis-related mortality reported using death certificates and 
administrative claims data might be explained by limitations 
inherent in each data source. These findings underscore the 
need for a reliable sepsis surveillance definition based on 
objective clinical data to more accurately track national sepsis 
trends and enable objective assessment of the impact of efforts 
to increase sepsis awareness and prevention.
Death certificate data were obtained from multiple cause-of-
death records of the National Vital Statistics System, using CDC’s 
WONDER database (http://wonder.cdc.gov/mcd.html). 
Multiple cause-of-death records include the immediate cause 
of death (i.e., the final disease or condition resulting in death), 
up to 20 contributing causes, a single underlying cause of death 
(i.e., the disease or injury that initiated the events resulting in 
death), and significant conditions that were present at the time 
of death but were not a direct link in the chain of events leading 
to death. All information on death certificates is documented 
by the certifier (e.g., a physician, medical examiner, or coroner) 
and subsequently coded by the National Center for Health 
Statistics in accordance with guidelines specified by the World 
Health Organization (3). National trends in sepsis-related 
mortality have been previously estimated from administrative 
claims data obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample,

25–44 years and 21% aged 45–64 years). Approximately 1% 
of decedents were aged <25 years. (Figure 2).
During 2004–2009, using data rounded to thousands, the 
annual range of published sepsis-related mortality estimates 
based on administrative codes (range = 168,000–381,000) 
was 15% to 140% higher than annual estimates generated 
using death certificates (multiple causes) for those years 
(range = 146,000–159,000) (Figure 1).
Discussion
Death records and administrative claims data are important 
sources of public health information. However, they provide 
different estimates of sepsis mortality, and recognizing the limi-
tations of both methods for generating sepsis-related mortality 
estimates is important.
Death certificate certifiers are required to indicate as the 
underlying cause of the death a specific disease or injury that 
initiated the chain of events leading directly to death (3). 
Because sepsis is the final common pathway for many different 
severe infections, certifiers might be more likely to consider 
sepsis an immediate, rather than the underlying, cause of 
death. This practice might result in an underestimation of the 
importance of sepsis as a cause of death and lower estimates of 
sepsis-related mortality that are based on the underlying causes 
of death only (8). Furthermore, because of misunderstandings 
regarding the process of completing death certificates, certifiers 
might omit sepsis entirely as a cause of death on the death 
certificate. For example, the New York City medical examiner’s 
policy of rejecting New York City death certificates with sepsis 
listed alone as the single underlying cause of death (without 
other contributing causes) has been misinterpreted by some 
clinicians to mean that the term “sepsis” was not permitted 
to be included anywhere on the death certificate, thus affect-
ing estimates of sepsis-related mortality (8). In addition, it is 
important to note that death certificates are often completed 
by physicians with varying levels of training in completing

death certificates; data from a survey of resident physicians in 
New York City showed that only 40% reported receiving any 
training by their residency program regarding completion of 
death certificates (9). Finally, sepsis can be confused with other 
acute medical problems, such as myocardial infarction, that 
frequently cause mortality in the community setting.
Estimates based on administrative claims data also have 
limitations. Previous analyses of administrative claims data 
have shown that estimates of sepsis incidence have increased 
over time, whereas diseases and conditions that can cause sepsis 
(e.g., pneumonia or urinary tract infections) have decreased 
or remained stable (10). Increased reimbursement for sepsis 
(compared with other infectious disease diagnoses) encourages 
hospitals to be more careful about coding for sepsis. Improved 
recognition and awareness of sepsis have also likely contributed 
to increased documentation of sepsis over time (10). Finally, 
administrative data only capture sepsis-related deaths that 
occur within health care facilities. However, approximately 
15% of sepsis-related deaths recorded in death certificate data 
occurred outside of health care facilities, suggesting sepsis 
mortality estimates based on administrative data might not 
include these deaths. 
Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome, representing a response 
to infection that can arise from many underlying causes. 
Differences in sepsis-related mortality estimates derived from 
death certificates and administrative claims data might be 
explained by limitations inherent in each data source. Current 
efforts focused on evaluating linkages of administrative claims 
data derived from inpatient medical records with death certifi-
cates will improve understanding of how mortality estimates 
from death certificates and administrative claims data should be 
interpreted. Strategies to prevent infections that lead to sepsis 
include vaccination for pathogens like pneumococcus, influ-
enza, and Neisseria meningitidis, smoking cessation programs 
to reduce the risk for community-acquired pneumonia, and 
facility-level interventions to reduce risk for health care–associ-
ated infections. A reliable sepsis surveillance definition based 
on objective clinical data is needed to more accurately track 
national sepsis trends and enable ongoing assessment of the 
impact of efforts to increase sepsis awareness and prevention.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Sepsis is a clinical syndrome caused by response to infection. 
Because there is no confirmatory diagnostic test, the diagnosis 
of sepsis is based on clinical judgement of suspected infection. 
Data from both death certificate and administrative claims data 
have been used to assess sepsis incidence and mortality, but 
estimates vary depending on the surveillance definition and 
data source.
What is added by this report?
To highlight the challenges and variability associated with 
estimating sepsis mortality, CDC compared national estimates 
of sepsis-related mortality based on death certificates with 
previously published sepsis mortality estimates generated 
using administrative claims data. Using death certificate data for 
the period 1999–2014, CDC found that a total of 2,470,666 
decedents (6% of all deaths) had sepsis listed among the causes 
of death (sepsis-related deaths); for 22% of these decedents, 
sepsis was listed as the underlying cause of death. For the 
period 2004–2009, in a previously published report, investiga-
tors analyzed administrative claims data using four approaches 
for identifying adult patients (aged ≥18 years) with sepsis. In 
data rounded to thousands, the annual range of published 
sepsis-related mortality estimates based on administrative 
claims data was 15% to 140% higher (range = 168,000–381,000) 
than annual estimates generated using death certificate data 
(multiple causes) (range = 146,000–159,000).
What are the implications for public health practice?
Sepsis is a complex clinical syndrome, representing a response 
to infection that can arise from many different underlying 
causes. A reliable sepsis surveillance definition based on 
objective clinical data is needed to more accurately track 
national sepsis trends and enable ongoing assessment of the 
impact of efforts to increase sepsis awareness and prevention.
