Phase I/II multicenter ketogenic diet study
for adult superrefractory status epilepticus
ABSTRACT
Objective: To investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a ketogenic diet (KD) for superre-
fractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in adults.
Methods: We performed a prospective multicenter study of patients 18 to 80 years of age with
SRSE treated with a KD treatment algorithm. The primary outcome measure was significant urine
and serum ketone body production as a biomarker of feasibility. Secondary measures included
resolution of SRSE, disposition at discharge, KD-related side effects, and long-term outcomes.
Results: Twenty-four adults were screened for participation at 5 medical centers, and 15 were
enrolled and treated with a classic KD via gastrostomy tube for SRSE. Median age was 47 years
(interquartile range [IQR] 30 years), and 5 (33%) were male. Median number of antiseizure drugs
used before KD was 8 (IQR 7), and median duration of SRSE before KD initiation was 10 days (IQR
7 days). KD treatment delays resulted from intravenous propofol use, ileus, and initial care
received at a nonparticipating center. All patients achieved ketosis in a median of 2 days (IQR
1 day) on KD. Fourteen patients completed KD treatment, and SRSE resolved in 11 (79%;
73% of all patients enrolled). Side effects included metabolic acidosis, hyperlipidemia, constipa-
tion, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and weight loss. Five patients (33%) ultimately died.
Conclusions: KD is feasible in adults with SRSE and may be safe and effective. Comparative
safety and efficacy must be established with randomized placebo-controlled trials.
Classification of evidence: This study provides Class IV evidence that in adults with SRSE, a KD is
effective in inducing ketosis. Neurology® 2017;88:938–943

Status epilepticus (SE) is the second most common neurologic emergency worldwide.1 SE that
continues despite appropriate first- and second-line antiseizure drugs is classified as refractory SE
(RSE).1 Current treatment algorithms use intravenous anesthetic agents for $24 hours to
suppress RSE. If RSE returns after anesthetics are withdrawn, patients are diagnosed with
superrefractory SE (SRSE). RSE and SRSE carry a high risk of morbidity, and reported mortality
rates range from 23% to 57%.2–4 Anesthetic agents may contribute to poor clinical outcomes,5
and determining optimal clinical management of SRSE is critical.
The ketogenic diet (KD) is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that induces ketone body pro-
duction through fat metabolism.6 KD is effective in drug-resistant epilepsy in both children and
adults, and recent retrospective studies have illustrated the potential efficacy of KD in treating
SRSE.7–9 KD is shown in case reports and small case series to be particularly effective in treating
SRSE in patients with febrile-induced refractory epilepsy syndrome,8 new-onset refractory SE,

Furthermore, KD is also shown to have anti-
inflammatory properties that may halt SRSE.11
This study examines the feasibility, safety,
and efficacy of implementing a KD algorithm
in adults with SRSE in a critical care setting.
METHODS Study design. This was a prospective, open-label,
single-arm study with the primary research question of whether
adults
with
SRSE
can
reach
therapeutic
ketosis
using
a standardized treatment algorithm (Class IV evidence). Secondary
outcome measures included adverse and serious adverse events and
response to treatment (Class IV evidence).

consents. The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Johns Hopkins Bayview
Medical Center (Baltimore, MD), Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN),
Queen’s Medical Center (Honolulu, HI), and Thomas Jefferson
University Hospital (Philadelphia, PA) Institutional Review boards

 Population. Consecutive patients 18 to 80 years of age diag-
nosed with SRSE (treated with medically induced coma for
.24 hours with persistent SE or return after attempt to wean
one or more anesthetics) from November 2014 to February 2016
were screened for eligibility (see the figure for inclusion and
exclusion criteria). Written informed consent was obtained from
each patient’s legally authorized representative.
Treatment. A 4:1 (fat:carbohydrate and protein grams) ratio KD
treatment algorithm is outlined in the figure.
Clinical data. Data collected included patient demographics,
history of epilepsy, etiology of SRSE, Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores, duration of
SRSE before KD, and antiseizure drugs used before KD. Contin-
uous video EEG data and urine and serum ketone levels were col-
lected every 12 hours after KD initiation. Adverse events were
recorded, and an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board
(DSMB) determined whether unanticipated serious adverse
events were potentially related to KD.
Outcome variables. Significant ketosis (defined as urine
acetoacetate $40 mg/dL and/or serum b-hydroxybutyrate
$2 mmol/L) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary
outcome
measures
included
resolution
of
SRSE,
GCS
and mRS scores at discharge, and disposition. Long-term
(6 months) outcome measures included seizure frequency
and continuation of KD therapy (either KD or modified
Atkins Diet [MAD]).
Descriptive study statistics. Proportions were calculated for
categorical variables, and means, medians, and interquartile
ranges (IQRs) were calculated for continuous variables.
RESULTS Clinical characteristics. Twenty-four adults
met the inclusion criteria. After the exclusion criteria
were applied, 15 patients were eligible to be
included in the analysis. Patients were excluded
because SRSE resolved before consent (3), patients
died before consent (2), the legally authorized repre-
sentatives declined patient participation (2), the
patient was a prisoner (1), and the patient had liver
failure (1). The median age was 47 years (IQR 30
years); 5 participants (33%) were male; and 6
(40%) had a history of epilepsy (table 1).
Etiologies of SRSE included new-onset refractory
SE (5; etiology unknown despite extensive serologic
and histopathologic analyses), intracranial hemor-
rhage (3), Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (2), anoxic-
ischemic injury (2), prior diagnosis of encephalitis
with recurrent SE (1), glioblastoma multiforme
(1), and remote nonaccidental traumatic head injury
(shaken-baby
syndrome)
with
resultant
drug-
resistant epilepsy (1). The median duration of SRSE
was 10 days (IQR 6 days) with a median of 8 (IQR
7) antiseizure drugs administered before KD. Delay
in KD initiation resulted from use of intravenous
propofol (1), ileus (1), and initial SRSE treatment
received at an outside hospital before transfer to
a participating center (8). Four patients (27%) were
receiving

 initiation, and 5 (33%) received another form of
immunotherapy (5 with plasmapheresis, 1 also with
cyclophosphamide) during treatment with KD.
Outcomes after KD initiation. All patients achieved
ketosis in a median of 2 days (IQR 1 day). Three pa-
tients were fasting and in ketosis on the first day of
KD because they received a feeding tube the previous
day. Anesthetics were weaned before 72 hours on KD
in 3 patients on the basis of clinical judgment. In one
case (patient 7), the family elected to withdraw care
after initiating KD, so she was withdrawn from the
study and died. At the time that the decision was
made to withdraw care, the patient had reached keto-
sis, and epileptiform activity was suppressed with gen-
eral anesthetics (midazolam). Myoclonic SE returned
on weaning anesthetics and stopping the KD. Eleven
(79%) of 14 patients who completed the KD treat-
ment algorithm had resolution of SRSE in a median
of 5 days (IQR 3 days) after KD initiation; 8
(57%) had resolution of SRSE within 1 week. In an
intention-to-treat analysis, SRSE resolved in 73%
(11 of 15) of all participants who initiated KD.
GCS score was equivalent to pre-SRSE baseline in 9
patients (60%) at the time of hospital discharge.
Adverse events occurred in 67% (10 of 15) of all
participants (table 2).
Five patients ultimately died, including the patient
in whom care was withdrawn. Three patients did not
have resolution of SRSE with KD and developed met-
abolic acidosis that did not resolve with bicarbonate
supplementation,
requiring
KD
discontinuation
before death. In one patient (patient 10), SRSE
resolved with KD, and he was transferred to a rehabil-
itation facility where KD was stopped and SRSE
recurred. SRSE resolved after KD was restarted.
However, he had a pulseless electrical activity cardiac
arrest, failed resuscitation efforts, and died. The
DSMB deemed the death unlikely to be related to
KD given the short duration of KD before the event
(29 total days).
Once able to intake oral nutrition, 6 of 11
patients (55%) on KD transitioned to MAD
(table 3). Four (67%) remained on MAD as of the
most recent follow-up. Two patients (33%) who
were seizure-free tapered off of MAD because of
difficulty adhering and remained seizure-free after
diet discontinuation. Two patients (18%) with inad-
equate oral nutrition remained on a 4:1 ratio KD by
feeding tube. Of 8 patients in whom 6-month follow
up outcomes were available, 2 (25%) were seizure-
free, 2 (25%) with a history of Lennox-Gastaut
syndrome had a .50% reduction in seizures from
pre-SRSE baseline and no further hospitalizations
for SRSE (multiple prior episodes), 2 (25%) had
ongoing seizures, 1 (12%) had a single seizure dur-
ing antiseizure drug tapering and none since, and 1
(12%) developed psychogenic nonepileptic seizures
but no definite epileptic seizures.
DISCUSSION We report the results of a prospective
multicenter study of the feasibility of treatment of
SRSE with a KD in adults. All patients reached
ketosis in a median of 2 days after KD initiation,
and SRSE stopped in 73% of patients, within 1
week of KD initiation in most patients. The KD
was well tolerated and feasible in this clinical trial.
At 6 months, 67% of patients were alive, and the
majority recovered to their premorbid functional
baseline. These findings are promising given re-
ported mortality rates in SRSE of nearly 60%.2,3
These results are also comparable to a recent phase
I/II platform presentation of 22 patients treated
with 547-SSE-201 (allopregnanolone solution) in
which SRSE was suppressed in 19 patients (77%)
and 6 patients (27%) died during the trial.12
Barriers to KD initiation included use of propofol
and ileus. Use of corticosteroids did not prevent
patients from reaching ketosis. Metabolic acidosis
was the most notable KD-related adverse effect,
which
occurred
in
4
patients
(27%)
and
necessitated stopping KD in 3. This highlights
the
importance
of
vigilant
monitoring
and
aggressive bicarbonate supplementation. Other
KD-related side effects included hypoglycemia,

This observational study provides preliminary evi-
dence that inducing ketosis with a KD in adults with
SRSE is feasible, despite their already complex treat-
ment regimens. Randomized placebo-controlled trials
are needed to determine whether KD is safe and effec-
tive in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients
with SRSE.
